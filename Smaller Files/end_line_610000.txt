So this is what happened to Trent as a kid!
This could be played at an Industrial-Gothic scene nightclub.
TOTAL CRAP IT'S A DISGRACE TO THE HALLOWEEN THEME
It sounds like a rob zombie rehash of dogshit  i hate it . Why not just go with a mix of 1978 and 1981 than this crap its horrible iam a halloween franchise fan this theme sucks
Definitely prefer the original but this is a caustic soundscape of torturous rapture...I love how it fucks with us, the shrill chilling scraping noise sculpture over the main chords & riff...Reznor & Atticus have always tantalized me with their sound art...can’t wait to see this version play out on the big screen
Noice
This sucks
00:55 woooooooooooo 🔥🔥
Michael Myers Slays the Rave
You're next.
Sweet!
Holy crap. Awesome. My favorite Halloween 🎥 and director. 🎃💀
Awesome... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour turn, Hans Zimmer.
Awesome.

ｓａｔａｎ　ｉｓ　ｒｅａｌ
Fantastic version!
Nice!
Ooft
This sucks...
Awesome
Fuck is yea
Damn, radical
Nice
Dude fuck yeah, this is so rad
Oh Trent... you amazing creature.. ❤️
It's 80s synthesized.
Shite.
🎃🎃🎃🎃
That sucked!
Not impressed.
Thissss
Changing the game as always!  Keeps the nostalgia and adds their own creepy kick! I fucking love it!
Wow that's very nice indeed
Fucking awesome! If they don't commission these guys for 2018 movie Ima be PISSED
Trent does stripped down electronic so well. I really dug this.
This is a brilliant version. Sign me up for some more  ;)
I smell a new ringtone..
I've been a Halloween fan my entire life but its things like this that make me embarrassed to be a part of the fan base. For the first time in 35 years Carpenter is officially on board with a sequel and is planning to do the music. And his music is a HUGE part of what makes Halloween special. Not to mention he has a longstanding reputation for creating numerous other classic film scores. So, Amazing news. Right, Halloween fans? But here's why I hate you. Because what's more amazing is how quickly you little fuck heads will turn and start campaigning for someone else to do it because something new comes along. Such as this new overrated theme. What the hell has Trent Reznor ever done in the horror genre to be considered a better pick to score the film than the man who created the original Halloween? What? Be lead singer of NIN? Who gives a shit. This is a film, not a rock video!!! Does anyone want this film to be scary? Have that classic Halloween feel and atmosphere? Not gonna get that with Trent Reznor. Jesus, You are the same people that thought it would be a good idea for Rob Zombie to make Halloween movies. Are you mostly all little kids? I think you have to be. Some of these comments are absolutely laughable. He made a theme, people. One theme. And its not Gods gift to Halloween themes, either. I've heard plenty of Halloween themes made by nobodies that were more impressive than this. What the fuck is wrong with you fans? How about showing some respect and understanding just how incredible it is that Carpenter is going to create another Halloween score. And show support for that. Not a fucking rock singer. My God. You guys are embarrassing.
Sounds good 👍
Incredible
That  sounded badass
insanity brilliant...
Freaking amazing

Sigo esperando el video de Look at us Now :v
I loved Logan and Children of Men is one of the best films ever made, so I had a lot of fun putting this one together! *What films would you like to see me tackle in the future?*\nAlso, if you happen to be looking for stock footage for a project and want to help support LFTS, check out the 7 day free trial of Videoblocks: http://bit.ly/LFTSVideoblocksTrial
Best video I have ever seen
I guess you can add The Last of Us to this as well and I love all of them. I guess I'm just a sucker for this type of story.
This video is beautiful. Thank you
Great vídeo !! I wound love to see you talking about The handmaids tale 😃
This is like a video essay. Thesis and supporting evidence.
The Beginning is the End is the Beginning - Smashing Pumpkins
Great video, can you do The Prestige?
Verrrrry well done sir! Keep up the good work!
The last of Us is heavily inspired by Children of Men and Logan is basically The Last of Us  but with mutants.
One of your best essays yet, Michael! I love both movies, and you've communicated why they are so effective so eloquently. Really good job
I will buy those books!
You have such fantastic content. I watch your videos multiple times bc they really get my creativity going. Thank you so much for the work you do!
When you brought up the protagonist believing in a lie that reflects the problems with society, my immediate thought was Bladerunner 2049. What a beautiful character arc for K
I didn’t even have the language to articulate it at the time, but I knew Children of Men was the most powerful (and probably best) movie I had ever seen the first time I watched it.
Great topic.  I'd believe this idea more if you started the explanation with the beginning of the stories instead of the end.  Better proof to just see how it is before the persuasive links are made for the learners.
This video is great. I’m definitely subscribing and definitely binge watching more of your videos
Another piece of media very similar to this is the Last of Us. Identical narrative composition.
Please do an analysis on La La Land! Though I personally think that the screenplay is mediocre, the execution is spotless, and I would LOVE an analysis on the this aspect.
I've never thought about this but soon as I read title of this video I (internally) screamed: Of course!
Wow, The Last of Us follows this formula point for point as well.\nI was joking when seeing the Logan trailer that it would be the Last of Us movie we didn't get but I hadn't realized how similar the two stories actually are until watching this video.
I'd never realized it, but the Matrix fits this structure to a T as well.
It is hard to believe how young your channel is. You went so far, so fast.
I appreciate your work so much. just amezing work.\nmuch love from Denmark
The Last of Us is similar, I think
Whatever you do, whatever you make, I always love all your videos :)
Really wish this was longer..I love these videos so much
Love this channel! I used your advice from the Star Wars LFTS to make the protagonist of my short film more active! Thanks for making my writing better.
Never seen Children of Men but it kinda reminds me of V for Vendetta. Why are the British so convinced they will be the last country standing(and why do they need to turn Fascist to do so)
Eyes Wide Shut is one of my favorite films of all time. I can't figure out why tho. DO IT PLEASE :-D!
Fuck man, I love this episode
We really need an analysis on Acts 2 and 3 as well.
I wonder if the academy has the guts to give Jackman a best actor Nom for Logan?
Okay, I would pay you to do a full analysis like this of your favorite movie. These videos are insane.
I love how, even though I'm a writer and not a director, most of the lessons you cover are applicable to my work. Big thanks as always.
This was fantastic!! Man...thank you for making these.
You are great at this. Thanks you for this. I love your essays. And also, your voice is soothing.
Once again, congratulations, Michael. I believe this to be one of your finest works yet. It's quite a pleasure to watch such thought and well-crafted analysis every week. By the way, I also consider Logan as one of the best films of this year, but I must say I did not care much for Children of Men after I first saw it, many, many years ago. After this wonderful essay, I sure will give it another chance. Greetings from Argentina.
Beautifully said.  I absolutely adore the analysis in your video essays, keep up the great work!
Soo, doing it only for the money lead to bad things eh? That's one similarity
While not a favorite of mine, I would love for you to do a analysis of Annie Hall, especially after seeing your video on When Harry Met Sally. I'm really surprised to not see anyone else request this one.
Do Where the Wild Things Are
This was fantastic. Thank you.
I really enjoyed watching this video
wait did cleo die? i thought he just passed out. fuck...im just gonna pretend i didnt hear that
(sorry about my english) I've never watched CHILDREN OF MEN, so I've watched only for watch this video. Amazing movie and analysis. Thank you.
Excellent video.
It's almost been a year since I started the 3rd draft of my novel for NaNoWriMo. I finished it in the summer time and have been taking a break from it to build my business, and I am often contemplating revising it soon.\n\nTHIS video essay has inspired me to come up with way better revision ideas than I had thought of the past year. Since I am character centraled writer, I'm looking back on my product and seeing the glaring flaws in my book AND the potentialfor it to be better. \n\nThanks to this video, now I have a better idea of how to handle my protagonist's character arc. The fact that the lie she believes in is too easily debunked early in the book, and now I am seeking ways to get that lie to hold her back even further than before so I can make a more compelling narrative.\n\nTHANK YOU, Michaeal, for everything you do on this channel. It truly helps a lot!
What is the music at 4:50 - 5:27? I cant find it on the sound cloud :(
Wow this was super helpful for me thank u!
Interesting video (for a change ^^)! Have you seen Blade Runner 2049?
This is the best video on this topic I EVER! Wow, you're amazing. Keep it up Michael.
The Last of Us fits this mould perfectly as well. Literally the exact same narrative arc.
could you please do the Shawshank Redemption next? \np.s. I love all your movies. Keep it up :)
I would love to hear you talk about an Edgar Wright film. Any of them really (my favorite is the World's End and no one talks about it). Anyway, great observation, great editing, thank you. I always look forward to your videos, keep it up.
Man, this video is great!
Do something over Jack Reacher Never Go Back
Dammit, I need Act 2 and 3! Great work man!
Love the video and the way it pleasantly surprised me. Also could you or anyone else please tell me the film music used in this video?
Had Clive Owen been ten years younger, he would have made an interesting Logan.  Had Hugh Jackman been ten years younger he would have made an interesting James Bond.  Hmmmm.  Not that Clive played Bond, but when you look at the old BMW ads he starred in you could see he woulda been a good one.
Try comparing Moulin Rouge and Star Wars because both have (possibly surprising) foundations in mythology/hero's journey, which is of course quite the common archetype for stories.
i think it's really interesting that the last of us could be considered a hybrid of both these character arcs. Joel is also a man devoid of hope for the future who travels across america with a young girl who symbolises hope. He also learns both how to love (value of family like logan?) and how to hope for a future again. P.S very solid video, well done
what about doing Leon or maybe a cartoon like rick and morty or a foreign film \nlove the channel!!!
While this is a video essay analyzing two screenplays, its like a short film in itself. Fantastic.
Yes yes and yes. Keep ‘em coming.
Always looking forward to your videos ! Thank you !
Awesome video. I like videos of this kind. However, i feel like the arc of Logan has been done a million times in different and better ways. I cant say anything about Childre of Men, because I havent seen it
You doing a great job in these videos. Thank you😊
End is the beginning. So basically the Last of Us
so basically the end is a new beginning?
Man, I get choked up just seeing that shot of Laura tilting the cross with no context or audio. Who'd have thought a comic book movie would be able to make me cry?
With the release of Justice League coming soon, I would love to hear your thoughts about the concept of the 'team up film'. I'm not only talking about Justice League and the original Avengers film but also films like Seven Samurai, Inception, Ocean's Eleven, the Dirty Dozen, the Usual Suspects and even Armageddon. This is a tired and true concept as it can work across all genres but it seems very hard to succeed at because not only do you need to have your team work towards a goal but each member of your team needs to have their own moments and unique personalities. What are some tropes you see in this particular format as well?
I found children of men a much better film in pretty much every way, Logan in my opinion was a poor film in general with a weak plot and weak characters
....So this is what it feels like...
Silence of the Lambs\nAmadeus\nIncredibles\nHer\nAll About Eve\nDead Poet's Society\nFargo\nExorcist\nGreen Mile\nChinatown
You always seem to make the exact right video for me. Keep up the good work! Love your videos
Great analysis of these movies. I really liked how you introduced a couple other influencing books. I am eagerly awaiting the next one!
Great video! I finally have Truby's book and it's a great resource, everything is laid out in depth and detail and once you see the structure, it's hard to 'un-see', such is the consistently refined nature of story-telling.\n\nStill waiting on The Godfather!
You can easily make the same comparison with The Last of Us
Throughout this clip I couldn't help but draw parallels between this formula and the video game , 'The Last of Us'. Anybody who hasn't played that, by the way, get on it. It is a masterpiece.
fantastic stuff
review rudderless
The Dresser and Birdman.
Good job.
Brilliant
You are truly amazing!
This was excellent
OMG! Great!
One  kingman
Good job mate...
You're awesome
subbed
Logan is a generic knockoff of Children of Men
Logan is not a great movie, Children of Men on the other hand, it is
Another perfect video yet again by the genius of you. Thank you! (: I wasn't too interested in seeing Logan but I am now because of this video. I would like a video on Moonrise Kingdom or Fantastic Mr. Fox :P
You've made a lot of amazing and useful videos. I have to say, this is the best and most important lesson you've taught.
Man, I really want to watch this video. I guess I need to see Children of Men.
Wow, this analysis was hypnotizing, I couldn't look away from the screen. Great video Michael, thank you!\nYour channel inspires me.
Great video! Would love to see your analysis of Big little lies
I'm sure you've been asked this before, but is there a resource list of all the books you reference in your videos? Would love to add it to my reading list.
and today I got to know that, her name is 'Rekha' , not 'Recca'. :D
Woman have the same rights
You know I used to think people who thought CollegeHumor and BuzzFeed were similar were silly, but as the days go by, they continue to advance into their direction. I am disappointed
Oh my god very revolutionary very progressive you guys at college humor really made a difference this time!
One of the better scripts in recent months
Thought i was about to be in for another sjw filled shitfest by college humor. Still a shitfest, but at least it made feminism look like a bigger shitfest.
This better be fake
This is stupid and sexist and sooo stereotyped like wtf we're your sources college humor also men have to apologize and this is a great example of how women are. Also it's funny how it says we don't know what Unfair is but by we I mean men which is retarded
When she’s outside you can see an add with Katie saying “Drink Splish”
I'm just hear to see Katie's T&A, so this video pretty much sucked.
looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool thank you guys so uch for this amazing chhanel and video
I don't really like how you guys are starting to make videos like this - you're starting to look a little like Buzzfeed and that's the worst thing for your company. I really enjoy your old school risque comedy but understand that the algorithm probably wouldn't allow for that. Just something that isn't to do with social politics would be great, I think it's why most people watch you guys, because you don't usually touch on these kinds of topics which is rare to find on YouTube these days.
WHO IS THE GUY IN THE GREY SUIT OH MY F GOD
You guys could post a video of just a piece of dogshit and all these idiots would still think it was funny
This video was cute, but one thing it wasn't... funny.
This video is the definition of fucking cancer.
Where's the humor?  Boring nonsense!
Cause you're a BIG stinky MAN
I bet none of you have even been to a real meeting. Its doesn't happen like this you SJW
Is this how comedians see board room meetings. Lol cute.
A very accurate alternate title to this sketch could be When Keepin' it Real, Goes Wrong. 😂 (ref hint)
Lol, the billboard in the background with Katie on it.
You’ve made your point..... in the first minute..... CH videos are dragging on too long lately.
I dunno. Felt a bit like it was trying too much to make a point but failed on the humor part.
I just hope they didnt fire her...
The last shot was the funniest 😂😂
Ugh Reika is this worst thing that happened to ch
This new person pisses me off
This is a joke by the way.
And then she joined buzzfeed
I can't tell if this is a parody of women or a parody of work places environments or if its just a silly video about cat power points.
Wow, things really are different for men.\n\n\nA man would have started kissing his boss' ass immediately!
This is retarded, why anyone watches it?
I like that billboard
CH is back to being funny!!! Yay!!!
Women logic at its best.  Just one more reason NOT to work with them.
lol i totally love this video. what an accurate presentation. I think this is why we are tired of winy feminists... they act out and are unstable over nonsense.
Is that woman still afraid of owls?
I felt like she took Katie's role in this one, funny all the same.
Reka you were so overacting However it happened and the whole idea is perfect fighting both sides of our charisma
The kitten is real cute, though !
Wow, this is pretty sexist... to men.
I think the real question is: how far is too far???
Such an awesome video Rekha is such a good addition to the team!
that ending was pretty funny tho
I thought it would be like your presentation was on kittens
I like her southern California accent
She straight up committed suicide. Women are idiots. Specially blondes.
This is 1000000% me omg I need to tone it down! Lol
Really?A bit stereotypical don't you think?
I find it funny but I feel stupid for laughing at the same time... strange
Kids this is what bipolar personality disorder looks like 😂
Who says women have to apologize or can't take up space...?\n\nAlso, micro-aggression's don't exist.
god thank you reika\nlove this so much
To be honest, women basically have all the rights of men in basically all developed countries, it's just the little things that need to be sorted now.
This was a cute video
Looks and feels so much like the acute OCD I had sometime back, which almost killed me. I don't know whether to laugh or feel bad! :():
Collegehumor has become like the Onion. I like it, but all I need is the headline to know what the entire piece will be and how it will go. I predicted that the presentation would be on kittens the second he called it cute and she rejected that. Comedy is about discongruency. When you make a formula out of it, you cannot get that discongruency.
The payoff was worth it. GJ CH
Still unfunny and none of this ever happens lol
Went on too long for something really not funny.
Trying to break stereotypes by showing a whiny woman.
@ Rekha...what's poppin 😍😍😜😘😘
facts
OFFENDED lying feminists lmao
Trigger warning
Somebody fire her
Nice tits
So cute!!!
Bipolar disorder
Femenist bullshit
bag her
Respect women
God damn, CH is really becoming Buzzfeed.
This is stupid
Feminazis in a nutshell
Fucking buzzfeed
Hahaha
Oh my god feminist bullshit
Woman? Yall ugly liberal sissies
She's cute.
Free
Ughhh
Reika just isn't funny.
This was disturbing
Deep
Lol
Lmao feminists in 2017
Fired
Rekha grosses me out
Plez don’t turn into buzzfeed
This was very unfunny. I'm not saying it was unfunny because of the subject matter, but it just feels like a very lazily-written skit.
Stop taking this seriously it's a comedy sketch
I hate this chick's videos. God, I want comedy, not to watch an SJW push her agenda.
Pretty well done but I wish CH didn't have to contrast scenes with violence for their punchlines as often as they do.
Wait. Women must apologise but you don't apologise... \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes that mean you are a man???
Hey @CollegeHumor\n\ni know you have Rekha for diversity points, but you are ruining what people liked college *Humor* for.\n\nHumor.\nnot politics
This is making fun of modern day American feminism. Too bad conservatives' brains haven't developed enough to understand that
She got it from Katy! That explains everything
wow this was surprisingly tame for buzzfeed\n\n\n\n\noh wait, this is just a bad college humor skit...

It's almost unfair how talented beck is. Almost.
mmmmm
Unicorn cum!
OMG😂😂😂

ssss
anyone got tabssssssss$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
muito bom
Cool
Boring
that purple slime is makin me wanna cream meself ngl
Magical!
Metendo a mão na massa
Wow, video quality is so bad. Even at 1080p it feels too much compressed and there's so much noise in it.
I feel the strange urge to squeeze boobies... nah forget it I feel it all the time
This is an odd thought, but I'm personally concerned about the environmental impact of this craft trend. It is as bad as plastic and has numerous ways it can kill wildlife.
The is Dr. Squish's dream vid
That is one hell of a hook.
Really slime omg this is so cool
Welcome back beck. This album is so much better then the last two.
Song’s addicting, won’t come out of my head
So much slime !!!!
*goes on instagram once*
Hidden treasure right here.
cool
good
Introducing:  Slime
beck and asmr
new beck YAY!  sounding a tad bit like g. numan! :)
If this is the actual music vid the slime has taken over
With this and his other new stuff Beck is pushing out a brilliant, feel-good vibe. Smile, sing, dance.
I want to make some pizza dough now
This video made me hungry
Beck! Fucking make some real music why don't you this is garbage
as for me ,  sounds great but too much of Duran Duran )))
Didn't know porn was allowed on youtube.
I love how beck has included cosimo henri, and Tuesday in his new videos.
WNDR★ #NewSound ~ Beck - Colors\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WonderMusicTV/posts/885781214929231
I wish these hands would be Mine😌
saving for shrooms
who came here from tibbleslimes
tibbleslimeees
I felt tingles all over
Remember Orbitz??  Yup.   Oh good track too.  Beck is frickin unstoppable
Love this ❤️😍
Bello!
satisfying video
Beck was watching some slime punk songs/videos
Great storyline.
wow
Best new song off the album
Tibbleslimes helped with the slime part
What's with the baby hands and what is under that other persons finger nails?
Holy fug, Beck brought floam back! 😎
Beck, you should buy an old 4 tracks recorder. This song is awful!
Dude. yes 🔥✨✨✨
Beck is so talented.
ASMR activate!
Throwback to George as a hand model circa 1993
great song but the slime with little balls is cringey
somebody tell me please these aere all subliminal messages😂😂😂😲
This is one of the non-inventive songs I've heard this year.  Beck's lost it!
Why didn't you released this when slime was as popular as Taylor swift
Casting call for hand models with long filthy fingernails
i like the flute
shit music for the brainless new generation ... bring in the cash says beck
coincidence that the video's length is 4.20?
How many professional slime fingers were hired for this music video?
So proud of you Maya!
I get this feeling that stuff Beck's doing lately is too cool to be true
This looks like something I leave in the toilet in the morning.
If Beck has a kid, the kids hand is his kids hands. Right Beck? ^_^
This was uh.... I little uncomfortable to watch.
Kool.  Are you thinking about it?.  Say,  yes. 6mths.
I don´t think the lenght of the video is mere coincidence :P
pop candy music/visuals targeted towards the millennial market.  beck knows his business.
Who else loves slime they should make a slime omoji
freakin awesome and as usual per Beck's standards original!  always loved Beck, always will!
Just got his new music cd yesterday. Great tunes! Grammy material!
i just keep imagining an epic fight inside a subway car
4:20 because that's trippy as fuck
It’s like watching the oddly satisfying videos playlist on Instagram
Best idea for a music video I have seen in a while
Love him so much! This video is so damn beautiful!\n I'm independent singer-songwriter and music producer. Hope you like my songs Devotion and Teenage Angst :) Please share your opinion and like. Thank you!:)
This is how you stay relevant.
Why do I have a hard on? 🙄
Best single from the new album. Eager to give the whole thing a listen
The most satisfying video in the world: SLIME EDITION
Every school needs a slime room. If you're feeling bad you can take a slime pass and play with slime for 10 mins then come back.
Astonished.\nFucking beautiful.
Alright! I'm going to google How to make Slime b/c this is too cool to miss out on.
YASSSSSS
Slime lover here!!!!!\nAnyone else?
Beck is always up to something dope
His new songs are garbage pop
The only pop music I listen to!
Just added the saint Laurent woc to my wAnt list. Gorgeous collection 😍
Coccinelle is pronounced Kochinelle, which, in Italian, means lady bugs! As always lovely video, the green Gucci bag is the stuff of dreams 😍😚
the frinch suits you so much Amelia!!❤❤
Iphone 7s plus 😒😒😒 really, Amelia?
What’s with you and the bags for dwarfs? 😂😂

https://xn--g0haaaaaaaaaaaa.gq/r/?S8RGoh0KMu3rc=2vFo3i3TaO8ncJnMThxLOBU1zJLSdN76moJ
You new hair is stunning, you look gorgeous!
actually coccinelle is an Italian company, and  it is pronounced cotschinelle in Italian
Love ur bangs! You look younger.
Where is your chair from😍😍😍😍
They will come in handy when the bulbs go out
Amelia those bangs looks so good on you 💕😍
I really love your hair! Best decision ever
hey amelia! coccinelle is pronounced like cochinellay :))
Love love love your style
Beautiful collection
Your hair 😍
Love ur handbag taste 👌🏼
Nice fringe x
Love your bangs!❤  Your hair is gorgeous!! 👌
Coccinelle is pronounced cokcinelle meaning ladybird in French :)
http://ameliaalicebryson.blogspot.com/?m=1
Amelia it is pronounced coXinelle 😊
Great new look. I love the bangs.
So many cute bags!! Loove the more muted pale colored bags they are so pretty :)
SUCH a great collection!!
Please tell me where you got the rainbow sweater you're wearing with the Chloe Nile- it's the cutest!!
Love your new hair !!! 😍👍🏻
Buy another Pomeranian, they're so cute🐶🐶
I am madly in love with your bags! 💖 I also prefer bags that hold their structure, but I never put it on the floor because of a Romanian superstition that says you'll loose your money/become poor if you place your bag on the floor😹. \n\nThe brand Coccinelle is Italian, so you would pronounce it with the ci as if it were ch(like in cheers) and it means ladybug. How sweet is that?! 💖 If it would be a French brand it would be pronounced coxinel.
Your hair! I love it!
Coccinelle means Ladybug, and it's pronounced cock-see-nell, if you ever wanted to know! ;) That being said, Gucci really upped their bag game lately!! I was never really into their stuff, but every bag you showed in here and the ones I've seen around are sooo pretty!!!
The floral gucci looks amazing!
Love the hair omg😍❤
love the way you did the video ♥️
That box clutch with music notes on it looks so gorgeous!!
The fringe makes you look Latina!
Not a fan of the bangs
Did you sell the Chanel chevron square mini? Love that bag!
Coxinel for coccinelle, it's lady bug in french 🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷
Beautiful collection!! Also, your hair looks great!! xxx
that red Chanel bag is so ugly 😟
The fringe fits you so well!! You look so damn chic! Urgh! Loved this video as always (your cutaways are by far the best)
The fringe makes you look even prettier
I came here to see your new beautiful hairstyle❤
Love your hair today, girl !!
You look French with your fringe.
That first bag is super chic and functional!  I'm in search of a good work bag and that one definitely caught my eye
WOW, Love those bangs, makes you look adorable, a blooming teenager.
You suit your fringe so much! I used to have one and they're awesome ❤️
OMG, I'm catching up on your videos and I only noticed the fringe AFTER the 12:37 minutes long video was finished and the thumbnail of the next one clued me in. That is how well you suit the fringe, it's automatically accepted by my brain as perfectly Amelia. Congratulations on getting the perfect fringe.
i feel like it's been ages since a sit down video like this, i really loved it, makes me want a designer bag so much 😻😻😻
Love all the bagss they are exactly how i like ❤️❤️
The brand is COCCINELLE! kisses from Italy,Sicily!!
Love your Multi Jumper, so cosy and cuddly.   Fave bag out of the ones you have is the Black Gucci 🖤  (p.s. Loved the yellow/gold 3 tier dress you wore in Paris).
Your handbag collection is so whimsical! Lovely! Thanks for sharing.
Love the new haircut it suits you 😍👍🏻
I was just thinking how badly I'd love to see an updated designer handbag collection! Literally read.my.mind! ((:
Your new fringe looks greattttt on you!
That multicolour knit jumper looks INCREDIBLE on you! Love that vibe. I'm surprised you don't use a cover for your glasses.
wow beautiful collection. btw what is the name of you nail polish color? its so beautiful.
That fringe is 😍😍😍 you look amazing.
A little bit jealous and a big happy for u~ LOL
I love the fringe on you!! Can you please tell us the lipstick you are wearing in this video?
I live in NY and I am always nervous to take nice bags out during the day.... BUT that givenchy bag is soon stunning! <3 <3
What size laptop can you fit in the Givenchy Antigona Bag?
Hi Amelia , please can  you let me know where the Mac/ trench coat is from that you are wearing with the Gucci Marmont ? Thanks
Hey Amelia, i know this isnt your kind of thing but could u pls consider doing a bridal makeup look? Im getting married in dec and i love the way you do makeup. Basically i love everything about you!
Always love your bag collection!
Coccinelle is an italian brand, it means ladybugs! We pronounce it co - chi (same sound of chips) nell - eh \n(some people do not pronounce it the same way they pronounce the italian word for lady bugs and they say co - chi - nell with a silent e and I have no idea why, it makes me want to email the brand and ask them!)
Coccinelle was founded in Italy, so the Italian pronounciation would be like tagliatelle in the end, and the cci is pronounced like chi in tai chi.
Loved this video and your hair!!!
If I ever won the lottery I would buy every bag in this video\n😂😂😂
I giggled when you said you own few green clothes while you were actively wearing a similar blue green top, though you may have done that on purpose
Great video ..... your petrol Gucci bag is size small and the pink one is the mini ....  I have the new royal blue velvet Gucci bag in the medium size and it's quite a bit bigger than yours 🌟🖒
Hi :) in english it would be something like kotcheenaellae\n\nIt's italian, and it means ladybugs!
Your hair looks so good 😍 It suits you very much.
Where is your black dress from!?
Overrated handbags
I was in love with your hair :( . Your handbag collection is life ! Sooo good pieces
Drooling over your bags!!! :)
Oh, no! Your fringe looks like mine, that I made myself when I was 8... Please, change it!
what size is ur MacBook air? <3
I feel somebody is not a fan of valentino.. don’t blame you 😂
They seem very cheap
You should be put on a desk, have your legs spread, and fucked *hard* but long, thick meat.
Which youtube executive did you bang to get on trending?
Omg the fringe is everything!!
This got 40k views in 21hours how the fuck is this on trending??????
Of all the marmonts you went for the worst solid colour bag...
It's pronounced Coxinelle (in french coccinelle means ladybug)
Hi Amelia  hope you're well. This is an impressive collection. So beautiful!! Still not sure about the fringe. One minute I think it's beautiful next unsure. You're still beautiful anyway. As long as you're happy.\nLove from the states
shoe collection???
Your hair is much classier like way! Well done for improving yourself and taking on constructive criticism
By 'tried on' she means 'held' 😂😂😂
Dayyyuummm
Bunch of Haterz in the comments. I can imagine those people to be analyzing every word he singing. It's good music for the Soul and Spirit. Don't matter if you don't like it because other people will.
This is 6lack putting his touch on the song, reason why it's a cover!!! I say flamessss!!!!!!
my nigga 6lack looking faded as fuck. mad cover
Not the biggest fan of dude's music, but I really don't enjoy just watching you guy shit on this cover. It was obviously from a place of appreciation and respect for Badu. This genre is similar but not totally his. And dude did his thing on it. Stop the hate spread love.
Greatness will always be critiqued by those less qualified. Bless 6lack
Neo Soul is supposed to be sultry and understated, enthusiasm doesn't necessarily have to be conveyed through being loud or charismatic. Fantastic musical sensibility.
6LACK got soul!
Aye im not gonna lie to all y'all haters, in my opinion i think this shit is fire
Great voice. Soulful af
I already know I'm gonna like this
I already New it was going to be fire had to like it before he even started
Straight Fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Unenthusiastic has a face
I heard dis song all my life... But he made me LISTEN. Badu was kicxin some REAL SHIT bac in da day...
6lack is my guy; great music, but this wasn't wow at all. more like an 'oh, aiight, that was cool, I guess' lol
So In Love with his voice! 😍
Not my style of music, but solid cover. 6lack has a strong set of pipes on him.
This cover is pretty good!!!! Wtf are y'all smoking. 😂😂😂
My day has been blessed :)
🔥
i can'tttttt<3
hoolyTv
They should do a collaboration 🔥
1:29 my favorite part 😍
I liked it, don't understand the hate, he should've been more vocally flexible he needed more range
Not bad at all
Not my style of music but i love it
Amazing 👏🏽👏🏽
6lack lookin like Hall & Oates in the She's Gone video
Fam killed it
Loved it ❤️❤️
i know it's probably because Ben and Liam get a lot on unsolicited hate in the comments but I miss the little intros at the start of these videos it was always cool to see a bit of what the artist is like
Cant wait for the show in Atl!!! Zone 6 baby
I honestly love this
😍🎧🎤 #6lack #vibes
Its a cover smh. Its supposed to be a lil differant.
6lack makes really good music, however, this cover should not have happened...like, at all.
The way I love this guy’s voice
Beautiful. \nGave me goosebumps when this was on the radio this morning!
I love this!! So soulful ❤ 6lack you did so dam good.
Best Like a Version in awhile
Huge! So well done xx
IM FUCKING SHOOK OMFG
🔥🔥🔥
🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Loved it.
Badass cover!!
yup, ill take it
Oh shit ❤
*Girls frом уour citу want to meеt уou*

HETDClwTAuA,\n► http://mibik.ru/sex?x=HETDClwTAuA 😎
1000 level up from badu, sick !
*yawn*
Lethargic
Definitely respect the nod to Badu. But this wasn't a good cover of On & On to me. No disrespect to 6lack though.
Shit sucks
It sounds okay I guess, maybe because he looks so uninterested in everything it kinda puts me off, haha. There is a girl on Youtube who does a cover that's really nice, her name is Mudi
Six-lack never fails to amaze me
Yawn....
Best thing since they found heroine
Bring john butler on again
Crap
This cover is trash lol this is disrespect lol
There's nothing remarkable about this.
who is this sixlack?
Terrible voice
how did he fit that rat on his head under that small ass beanie
Erykah wanted to call him after hearing THIS ? Sounds lifeless to me. No feeling. #DontBelieveTheHype
Lisa looking gangsta with all those rings 😄. Love this makeup look. It isn’t easy working on mature eyes but I think the trick is not to overthink it. This smokey eye still works 👍🏾
Gorgeous!!  Both of u!!  Thank you for sharing this moment in time with us!!
Great video, thank you so much for sharing this! You both are gorgeous & talented. It's wonderful to see two extremely successful women supporting each others work. LOVE!! One minor point, pizza cutter?!? How 'bout modified ball-point pen instead? <
What a lovely guest and a wonderful surprise!  A favorite of mine since the 80's!  Beautiful...
LOL I hit like before even watching!
Please please do rose makeup look from titanic... You seem to know exactly what celebrities use for their roles and real life.. I wana know what Kate used in makeup as rose and what hair colour was used and hair cut... Please do that video!!!!
I'm pretty decent with makeup but if I tried that dark of a smoky eye omg I would be a mess! Seriously talented! Goals dramatic but still minimal
I really love how she is ageing gracefully.
2 wonderful women sharing a wonderful moment with us! Thank you ladies you’re both so inspirational.
Claudia had a few Chelsea Handler angles for me in this...
So beautiful! Loved the quick questions
She´s an archangel.
Make up look with Liu Wen, please! There are not so many make up tutorials with asian beauties. It'll be amazing!
Do you have a new ring or two?
Love how Claudia allows her face to have frown lines and crows feet, instead of botoxing everything away like what happens in Hollywood. Ageless beauty!
I have been waiting my entire life for this.Thank you thank you thank you.I love you Claudia
I didn't think Claudia would be like this, I have never really seen her talk much before. She seems really smart, down to earth and just a cool chick to hang out with. Great tutorial.
I love the 60s looks! Claudia has the most fantastic skin...stunning!
I love all the great 90s supermodels....! wow! despite the fact that they´re older now, they are still so stunning! Bravo, Claudia and Lisa!
Of course it's gorgeous!  So sad that Claudia's makeup is not available in the US :-(
Such a cute video!
Brigitte Bardot is a beautiful woman but let's not forget she's also a keen racist.
She still looks like an angel. That skin!!
Yep! As I suspected, Lisa's rings reproduce
Hi Lisa, I really enjoyed this with Claudia, I’m a massive fan. I also made a video the other day on Claudia too. It’s part of my female icons series - I would be thrilled if you could comment and watch it. I’m a massive fan of you and have been following your work for a number of years which has inspired me to go into makeup myself. My YouTube channel is Laura Gask. Thank you for your time.
just look at this beautiful creature =) no botox and fillers... just plain gorgeous in and out ..   the most beautiful woman in the world!
Anyone know where Lisa’s rings are from?
Claudia looks so sweet such a kind person
Yes, what a treat! My fave model of all time with the best makeup artist ever!
She is the most beautyful creature in the world. I adore claudia🌹❤️. Thankeyou, Lisa
It's such a joy for me to see Claudia's make-up being applied, and it's also a treat to see how *even more* exquisite she has grown over the years :) It is hard for me to quantify 'why' and 'how', but maturity really does enhance one's beauty; perhaps it is the lack of self-consciousness or the ease of one's smile... I'm not sure. But whether our friends and family would describe us as beautiful, interesting, or even kind is not so much the point as living a good and honest life ― a life of love, generosity and spiritedness ― I firmly believe that this shows in our appearance :)
I saw one of the OG Supermodels, I clicked
OMG how do you get one of the biggest supermodels of all time in your video?
Black eyelashes and blond hair... isn't it weird?
Funny intro! Really loved the energy between you two Lisa. I did notice the new ring additons. They are so beautiful. Always wondering where you find those dashing rings.
I gave away a fragrance by Agent Provocateur to a free box.  ehehehehehehe
What a goddess she is
Wow, she seems so sweet , nice and authentic!
Once the Top Supermodel in the World, some 25 years ago.
Omg one of my favorite supermodel. She's the perfect Bardot.💕
this is a beautiful makeup tutorial and really fast haha I love all of the colours and you are my favourite YouTuber.
I slept with my makeup on last night. Take me out back and shoot me. :D
My younger brother was IN LOVE with Claudia Schiffer back in the day-she is still stunning and I just love her imperfectly beautiful teeth!,
Lisa Eldrigdge's videos are the only makeup tutorials I need and want to see. Love your work!
If only I could sleep in my makeup and look like Claudia when I wake up!
Lisa!!!! thanks SO much for featuring the original supermodels like Yasmin Le Bon and Claudia! Just what I needed after a hard week :D
oh Claudia is lovely isn't she - so articulate, warm and gorgeous  xxxxx
Beauty really comes from within...
Whoa Lisa is taking to the next level . Love Claudia . She's perfect !
Omg Claudia Schiffer is my favorite model ever since I was a little girl.
OMG her skin is flawless i can't believe this.. another lovely collab!
I love how you are bringing back the legendary 90s supermodels. First it was Yasmin and now it's Claudia. Gosh.. I can't wait to see who you'll invite next!
You should re do the Vogue Cover again. Maybe in an updated version! Could be so cool :D
She is such a beauty, and you make her look even more beautiful!
I LOVE HER RINGS
I'm creeped out look at our last names
I'm pleasantly surprised at how natural Claudia looks! She clearly hasn't had work done but looks amazing! A great example to women.
Hi Lisa love love love your tutorials 😗😗😗😗😗😗. Thank you for making makeup so easy and bringing such an icon on your chanel.
OMG I loved that funny voice at the start LOL
Beautiful Claudia! Natural beauty. She is my fav model . 😘
I love this video Lisa!! Claudia is timeless!!
Could you please make a tutorial of the Gal Gadot Wonder Woman makeup?
She looks so similar to Chelsea handler lol
Lisa doing the Queen's make up probably: Look at me, darling.
Looved the video! The makeup was perfect for Claudia. Loved the lip liner and lipstick!
A Real Beauty !! AT LAST !!! So there are some women in the business that they are not botoxed up their heads! Impessive!!!
Thank you for sharing the video, Lisa! I love how Claudia is so natural & classy and looking after herself after 30 years in fashion. She is comfortable & confident in herself that she doesn't mind showing us her lines, which we all have!!! Great to see her amazing self after being her fan for 25 years!!! Love Claudia!!!! XOXO
I Loke your ring from where you got it
I absolutely loved this video. MY QUEEEEENS.
The original supermodels have not aged, they are goddesses x
She looks sooooooo gorgeous like she was born to do this makeup. wow
youtubers should take tutorials from Lisa. Look how little makeup she needs compared to all the beautygurus !
she looks natural, no botox, no porcelain on teeth.
She’s prettier now than she was 20 years ago!
When does the book release?
Love you both,  but this time what stole my heart was the lipstick. OMG. The whole look, as obvious, it’s stunning.
Watching this video has made my day. Thank you Lisa!!
Can we just PAUSE FOR THE CAUSE!!!! Claudia effin Schiffer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I really appreciated seeing Claudia as she is, a beautiful 47-year-old woman without filters. Absolutely lovely, and spectacular makeup, again, by Lisa. Thank you - perfection!
Claudia 😍😍😍
Lisa: Thank you!
Omfg! THE Claudia!
💜💜💜💜💜
Thoroughly enjoyable, Lisa!

Wow does Claudia  ever age???
Claudia looks unbelievable

Wowzers!
😱😱😱😱😱
She's gorgeous
Wow, she looks gorgeous!
She is divine!
OMG!!!!! Claudia is timeless! Just like yesterday! Gorgeous!
New rings!
Lisa, I love your channel, but your content feels skewed. I’d love to see more women of color (and darker skinned models) featured. Not to do so seems tone deaf to all that’s going on in the world. Thanks.
€10,000 raised for charity? That's amazing Lisa! I'm going to go back and watch all your videos + adverts again ❤

Love the new character
You mean... you weren’t wearing makeup at the start of the video????? Wow goalsssss
Omg I thought you were wearing makeup until you started applying your makeup. Your skin is perfection!!!
It took me like 10 minutes, till you applied the perfecting tint, to realize you had no makeup on... looking gorgeous Anna xxx
Do not buy the vitamin C serum by Glossier. Vitamin C in a clear bottle is a no-no. Also, the serum is already tinted yellow. Not a good sign. For the niacinamide + zinc, opt for the The Ordinary one for a much better price. Same for the hyaluronic acid serum. Even better than The Ordinary, I would suggest the Hadalabo Super Hyaluronic Acid Lotion.
Thanks Anz x

Getting my order delivered tomorrow😄
ArzuJann
Your hair looks so luscious!!!!
It is a very comprehensive video BUT please no more glossier.  I'm fed up of hearing it on your channel
So helpful!!!! Thank you xx
Very helpful video Anna! Thank you 😊 👌🏻
Nice review. Disappointing that Glossier has such a limited shade range.
Overpriced overhyped and hardly much coverage in any of the Base products . Watched a good few reviews of glossier and definitely nothing special
HOLA muñecas a que hora salen por el pan bizcochitos
I made my first glossier order 3 days ago now, and it still hasn't been dispatched :(
Love this, I went to the Glossier showroom when I was in NY a couple of weeks back, and pretty much bought everything you rate as good!\n\nWould love Glossier haircare next!!
This was v.helpful Anna! And your makeup looks super pretty xx
Best Glossier review I've watched! Well done 👍🏻
Loved seeing you work through all of these Anna! So happy for my friends in England who can finally grab it. As for Australia... we're used to being patient haha. I have a whole lot of individual detailed Glossier product reviews over on my channel for any UK girls who want to see swatches before they buy! x
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU! \nI've been seeing sooo much hype around Glossier's products, and just had no idea where to begin or any idea of how to figure out if their products were worth picking up! This video is EXACTLY what I needed. So helpful Anna, you're such a babe! x
I've already done an order for the skin tint, the cherry balm dot com, the haloscope and the boy brow in black but you're making me want to buy more!!!!!!! My bank account is gonna be so mad at me.
I have a 10% discount for your first order 😁 - http://bff.glossier.com/gHtxF
Totally not related to the video, but I love your hair! It looks so shiny and smooth. What have you been using?
Thanks Anna. I was going to buy the Invisible Shield Factor 35 as I have the same type of skin as you but will save my cash and get the stretch concealer. x
The makeup looks lovely on you Anna!! I really hope they ship to Australia soon!!!!!
This was so useful! Now I know what to get 😉 and yay trending!!xxx
wow your product arrived the next day, meanwhile i just got an email from them saying my order's gonna take longer than expected (more than 5 business days) so unfair :(
i wonder if they ship out of UK, do they ship in other parts of Europe too, when ordering from the UK site?
Thanks for doing this review, Anna, I love your reviews!
Best set of reviews on Glossier that I’ve seen so far. You’re awesome. Now I know what I’m going to get and what colors. Xo 😘
Amazing review and really helpful! My bank balance is going to take a hit tonight! X
Your skin is so flawless! When the video started I thought you were wearing make up!
I really enjoy the Milky Jelly Cleanser but the Super Bounce did nothing for me. I have seriously dry, dehydrated skin and I felt very tight after using it.
That's a great lip color on you. I tried it and it didn't work. I thought the Generation G lip colors were toooooo drying and matte on me. The Stretch Concealer is my GO TO concealer...even with 56 yr. old undereye skin. It looks like skin and doesn't crease or settle!  Thanks for the review.
Bloody loved this, I know what's going on my Christmas list now!! Ps Anna you look gorgeous!! 😍
This was a great review 👏
I can't wear sunscreen directly on my skin. So I have to layer it on top of my moisturizer.
Thank you for this!! Super helpful. Feel like I can justify a couple new purchases now :)
Love the milky jelly cleanser.  The wowder made me break out.  I kept trying it because I really like the finish.  I have oily skin, acne prone skin and I just couldn't make it work.  The cloud paints were great, but after an hour they would disappear off my face.  I really wish they had more staying power.  Probably better for drier skin.
The Glossier Cloud Paints are my fave! I add a small dab of Puff to Dusk and it creates the most natural rosy nude. I find Dusk on its own to be too brown, and Puff to be too bright pink but together - perfection :)
I had a bit of a glossier shopping spree the Monday when uk shipping became available, after watching this I'm really happy about my choices and am looking forward to receiving them. I got the haloscope in quartz, the balm dotcom trio (rose, birthday and cherry) and the phase 2 set (light, brown and zip). Zip looks like it could be the exact wore look red I've been trying to find for months, I can't wait to try it all!!
Thank you for reviewing the body products as I was mulling those over. I will now give them a pass as I too have sensitive skin and can't tolerate overly fragranced products. Also, anyone with sensitive skin or Rosacea prone skin should always avoid chemical sunscreens and opt for the physical sunscreens.
Please make a skin care video with your favs, your face skin is awesome!
I can't get enough of the coconut balm dot com and Milky Jelly Cleanser!
Thanks Anna. Super helpful, well presented review. I was trying to resist buying anything and then, bang!, you hit us with the 10% off code. I've just bought half of the Glossier website and couldn't be happier! Hoping Cake Generation G will make me look as fly as you and Allana :]
you always come up with the most helpful and well thought out videos! btw you're skin looks absolutely incredible! when you started putting make up on I got so confused hahah xx
I made my first Glossier order a few weeks ago and ordered one of almost everything! The only thing I do not care for is the skin tint. It makes me look like an oil slick about 2 hours in. Loved this review and you are the reason I made the order in the first place!
Oh man - Wish I'd watched this before I ordered some products! I need some Generation G!!
Love the thorough review! I'm also waiting for Glossier to release a bronzer :).
As a Combo skin, sensitive, dehydrated and acne prone skinned girl - the original priming moisturizer is holy grail for me. Changed my skin for the better.
Thank you for this Anna, very informative and on the strength of this have ordered a few items to try. I don’t know if you have been asked this before, and I know you’re pushing Glossier here, but have you ever tried any of The Ordinary serum products? If you have, I wondered how comparable you found them to say the Glossier serums? Thanks.
LOL definitely pale! - Right there with you! Thanks for the reviews, I placed my order the other day and can't wait to get it!
Thanks Anna! Really great informative video, my Glossier shopping list just got longer! Also noticed you are number 8 on Trending!!
You have such amazing brows, do you do anything to tame them, grow them, keep them healthy? Gorg! Xxx
You’re not the first one who itches after the shower gel. I’m missing out on these!
No customs? In that case I'll probably try the boy brow at some point since it's cheaper than benefit gimme brow. I haven't purchased a gimme brow in the new packaging yet because I don't like the new packaging and I'm annoyed that they increased the price.
I like that you kept it realistic! Xx
I've been looking forward to this video so much. However my first thought at the start was your hair looks great.
Love this- just done a glossier shop and this totally helped me make an informed decision. Bought stretch concealer, priming moisturiser rich and moon mask 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
Thanks for the comprehensive review Anna!
you should always wear this tint ! it's so nice on your skin
Just waiting for my first order, looking forward to trying them. PS, I just listened to a podcast where Emily Weiss mentioned she uses her milky jelly cleanser on her err intimate area, you’re welcome lol xx
All the makeup YouTubers paying to get on trending hahah
out of everything you showed in your video today ima buy the bobbi brown  brush...and the cleanser
Ah I'm about to place an order but I can't select shipping in the uk anymore. I almost placed one yesterday and it was fine then 😭
Amazing run through! Thx Anna! Feel super informed and ready to hit up the site x
Yes!!! I have been waiting for this aha xxxx
Hi Anna, you mentioned having psoriasis a couple times before and I wonder if you could you do a psoriasis video? Not very glamorous I know haha - mine pretty much disappears in the Spring and reappears in Autumn so I would love to know your tips before it comes back. Thank you!!
Getting my order tomorrow can't wait 😀
Dying to know how the new perfume smells!?
I love crush!!! It looks great on my skin tone!!! I think it’s a very universal shade!!!
I disagree with the skin tint! I have OILY skin and that product is a holy grail. Matifying products always break down weirdly on oily skin. I just embrace my shine and that product doesn't break me out at all
Loved this.  Almost placed an order but glad I waited.  Based on your information about using the products for awhile, I have changed my mind about some items.  This video has helped me out a lot!  Thanks for the very helpful info, Anna!!
Thank you so much for this Anna.  I am about to do my first order and this is so helpful. X
Its been a month and i was skeptical to order but now I'm going to buy. Its a big order but im very curious to not look so beat. Im a little over that look. And this company celebrates natural beauty. I do have acne scaring not so severe but as my skin heals i feel its best to embrace my flaws as they recover. Long story short im buying.
Such an insightful video, can't wait to order! xxx
Obvs I placed an order on Monday (hurry up and arrive please!) but now watching this makes me want to go for order number two!
Can't wait for my order, watching you and Lily rave about this has made me so excited for UK shipping. Not sure my credit card will thank me though! Thanks for such a great review!!
Hiya, I sent you an email about helping me with my a level EPQ, would really appreciate if you reply as soon as possible xx
my first order is on the way over from the US right now. yay to shipito. I'm kind of excited - I hope I picked the right shades. I was like you know what you look like a mozzarella just get the lightest one of everything 😂
Very helpful! I'm hinting to family in the UK to send some to me in SA. Totally unrelated but... what do you use on your hair? It's always so lovely and shiny and sleek.
Thanks Anna this was very helpful - I have ordered the milky cleanser and concealer, hooray!
I love Generation G! They give a tinted look but feel nicer than a lip tint. I also really love the Milky Jelly Cleanser, Haloscope (Quartz) and Cloud Paints (Puff and Dusk for day, Haze for night. I'm also really enjoying Wowder (I look moisturized but it tamps down the Glossier look of looking like I can fry an egg on my face haha). The rest I'm kind of meh with. Stretch Concealer was a fail because I feel like it didn't actually conceal anything and Priming Moisturizer Rich WAS THE THE WORST because the lavender oil broke me out. I was so disappointed when I saw the lavender oil in the ingredients list but I bought it anyway because I love the brand. Anyway it was good to my skin for about two weeks and I actually thought the lavender oil would be ok...and then it murdered my skin. SMH.
Thanks so much for this! As someone with oily acne prone skin most of the skincare is a miss for me and makes me break out terribly (ugh superbounce was awful for me) so I appreciate the disclaimer in the beginning. I would stay away from all the skin products if you have acne prone skin even the concealer and highlighter which has coconut and castor oil. Don't get sucked in!
Just about the order my basket then this popped in to my subscription box !!  Perfect timing thanks Anna !!

I'm loving the look of your hair on this video Anna! You look so pretty :)
Love you and your videos! For redness you should try dr. Jart’s cicarepair tiger grass in the pot! Its so good and has spf in it too 👍🏼 really think you’ll like it 🤗
What a lovely review! I just ordered th Boy Brow in Clear and the Stretch Concealer in Light!! Can't wait to try them!
I really want to try the concealer but I'm not sure it'll cover my mum eye bags!! Xx
I haven't tried these products yet, but I've watched about a dozen videos reviewing them. They seem like they are targeted for women with really good skin, who don't want to wear much make up but just want a little boost. To be honest,my impression is that they are a lot of hype and not a lot of benefit for the money
Just back from New York (still strugling with my jetlag), but I think it's a hype. Only bought the cleansing gel (is ok) and the brow gel. Otherwise, nothing special. It's all about the woman who really doesn't need make up.....(according to the Hirons lady),....so why use it than? Marketing: genius, quality wise: nothing special. So thanks, but no.thanks! 😂😎 And for the stickers...sorry, I'm nót a teenager that loves little kitty!
Yes, Glossier is really hyped, but I have a few issues with some of their products. I have no sensitive skin a lot, but skin tint, priming moisturizer and sometimes even the concealer make my eyes burning like crazy! I love the milk jelly cleanser, the balm - I should have picked the coconut one instead of the birthday one because I wake up in the morning with glitter everywhere on my face :P - and also the lipstick in Leo.
giiiirl, please do a body care video! I have terribly dry skin and love any recs to make my life better <3
Need to try Boy Brow!! Loved this video! Xoxo, Caylie
Why is this on trending😐👏🏼
There are heaps of Korean sunscreens that leave no white caste and have an SPF 50! Check them out - a lot cheaper and great for sensitive/light skin 😊
*the mole on your cheek looks like it has its own gravity and is pulling the side of your lips towards it*\n\n\n\n*jk :D, love ya!*
your home vid is beautiful. Also you hair is so pretty and curly.  Your curly style is back! :)
I love this format!
you seem very passionate about decorating... made it enjoyable to watch! lovely space!
I was under about that blue sofa at first but it really came together and now I love it in that space! Defiantly gives me some inspiration!
I really enjoy decorating and find it very therapeutic as well. Where do you find most of your inspiration? Do you have any recommendations for interior design books?
Because of you, Sammi....I will be shopping for plants next week!! LOL.
Beautifully filmed. Thank you for sharing with us xx
The video was so beautifully shot
Simply beautiful and cozy !  Thanks for sharing your home with us.
Absolutely loved it! Such an inspirational video
Also the sofa for me is a winner :-)
You look so beautiful!! Loved this style of video. Please do more. (:
Hey Samantha where did u get your cup 'the one with ur tea/ coffee in the video?
Omg I love your style goals I one day dream of having a beautiful home like yours 😍🏡
what happened to Riley...the other dog?
good god you look GORGEOUS in the intro! also your interior style is to die for!
Such a great video! Your home is gorgeous and i really like the format as well.
So fun! Your home is beautiful, can't wait for more videos about it :)
Random thought but your fringe kind of looks like a bob and I think you'd look really pretty with a curly bob
Haven't watched for awhile,  beautiful home.  What happened to her Frenchie?
I love love love your home decor design, the sofa is beautiful and all the plants and prints 😍😍😍
love the space. And OMG your hair look's amazing!
Such a pretty home.
What collar is frank wearing? Love it. Is it ruffwear?
Love this ! Keep continuing what you do I love chit chat
i wanna be as cozy as frank
As someone who's been watching you since '08, I am super proud of you and your accomplishments! Also, I know you are human and don't want to attract negativity and drama, but girl. You gotta be unapologetically yourself! Say what you wanna say. You're going attract haters no matter what you do/say. Let em talk (type really), cuz at the end of the day, you're still making your money, you're still a great youtuber (and a veteran youtuber on top of that), and you're still a bomb ass mom! Don't let them control your actions, especially online. Changing what you say and limiting your voice is exactly what the haters want.
Loved, loved, loved this format. Your spaces are beautiful and you can see all the love that's been put into your home.
Love you house and your interior design.. you so lovely
Love this style of video Sammi  xo
this vid is so relaxing and interesting and YOU LOOK STUNNING
Your home is beautiful and yes..very relaxing.
Where's Riley?? Did he pass? :(
I found myself nodding in agreement throughout the whole video lol!! You get me! Love your style in everything but your home is especially beautiful <3
Can you please Vlogg more about your workouts! i need motivation thanks
Can anyone recommend me some good home decor books please? I need this style in my life😻
I love this format Sammi and your space is amazing!! xx
That couch is everything!!
Sammi Id like to request a video regarding financial management after marriage. How do you manage to budget? Do you combine your income? Or does Jason lets you do the budgeting around the house? You do not have to include figures, more on tips and when there are problems regarding financially how you and Jason handle it @samanthamaria
You look so pretty sam! And your house is gorgeous
I would love loads of plants in the living room but they would just die lol. I love this room it looks amazing :) x
I feel like I stepped into a magazine watching this. This is great Sam, I always thought you had an amazing sense of style. Also, I loved the fact that you weren't just walking around with a camera showing us random stuff. I quite like your sit downs
I absolutely love this style of video and love your home xxxx
i like this style of videos. please do the rest of the house like this xx
Sammi I feel like we could be such great friends irl! You have such a sweet personality and I love your style!! 😊😊
Love this format Sam! It's wonderful. It is different than most room tours! This is creative! Love to see more rooms from your home.
I love your space! both rooms that you showed are beautiful! I just moved into my own apartment and will definitely be taking a little bit of inspiration from this video regarding my interior style :)
This is such a beautifully shot video Sammi! I feel like you got the perfect balance between sit- down chatty parts, and shots of the rooms on their own. Can't wait for more! x
super cozy! but where is riley? :(
The living room looks like a photo you would see in an interior magazine and be like, where is that? I wanna live there it looks so dreamy😊 i also love your filming room and i find this so inspirational
You have amazing interior style Sammi! Loved this ❤️
I always felt asking for a tour is too invasive, so I never ask but I am so excited for this! I noticed in your vlogs, the mantle in the living room and the way you style it with the plants and mirror...simply stunning😍
Hi Sam,Indie and Jason. I've been a viewer of yours since day one and so proud of you! You are amazing and one hell of a badass mum. I appreciate all your honestly and realness.\nIt's very refreshing! \nSo question for you. \nI just moved house as well and have a 4 year old daughter. Im using your decor as inspiration for my new place. Just wondering what wall colour did you use for your office and livingroom. Lots of love from Canada.
Oh my it's absolutely perfect !!
Love the format! And the chilled vibe. Much love!
Such a cuddle couch, I love!
I love your home 😍
I love your eclectic style! So sophisticated yet at the same time homey and inviting!
Love the vibe of your place and the video- very chill and cool~ any chance you'll restock your candle in the near future?
Love the style of both rooms; warm and cosy 😍... u should become an interior designer 😉
I love how well thought out this video was, super different and creative. Always enjoy your videos <3
Your style is so nice! I have a very similar style too
Ugh! Please come and sort out my flat!
I loved the video and the format is just fine.  It felt very personal.  I love your style and I too would love a botanical vibe BUT my cats destroy every plant!!!! : ) xo\n\nNatoya
I love interior design too! The rooms look so calm and clean!!!
omg so inspiring! Love you and your family so much <3 Could you do a video about how to style small spaces? I have a one bedroom apartment and have no room for an actual office but still want to have an office space. Help! <3
Both spaces were to die for! Love your style Sammi, and the way that the video was filmed was great too!💙💜💛
What a refreshing house tour style video! Love the format, can't wait to see more! 😍
Initially when I saw the sofa when it was first delivered (I think in one of the vlogs?), I liked it but thought it didn't go with anything and stood out too much... but now I see it in the fully realised room, it just looks like its been there forever! It goes amazing with all the greens and yellows in the room! Such a stunning living room!
Loved it! I’m decorating my apartment and this helped me so much. x
Stunning home!! Where did you find the chair you're sat on in the office tour??
So... where is Riley??? Didn't see him for so long :(
I feel like i could just walk into your home and go to sleep. It looks so relaxing.
Beautifully edited! Loved the format everything from the music to camera shots. The living room definitely has that botanical vibe to it! xx
I like the dressing of your fireplace a lot, especially with the green around it.
Yasssss Sam!!! Loving this your house is beautiful!! Me and my partner have just moved into our first home so this inspo is much needed!! Xxx
She is under thirty and owns a house in the UK. Fake!

House goaaaalllsss 🔥🔥🔥
Omg I love everything :D
+ 😍☕️
Love this! 😃
Why are these talentless, repetitive girls always on trending despite having no views?
Oh shit watching these demo speedruns are my new favorite thing now
You can hit the bombs back at the Broodal when she's dropping bombs everywhere. It won't knock her hat off but it will end the phase sooner.
ONLY. TWO. WEEKS.
Okay then, the movement in this game looks super cool.
They should just give you a free copy
Jesus, the game isn't even released yet.
Well done... can't imagine what you'll accomplish with the final game.
Awesome speed run! The hat throw is going to be really broken!
I love learning how to master how Mario controls in 3D Mario games and watching this speedrun only made me more excited to play Odyssey.
You wasted so much time waiting for the Broodal to finish her UFO phase. If you throw Cappy at one of the bombs she drops, it will hit her and knock her out of the sky, ending the phase like 5 seconds earlier.
Holy shit\nThere is already a speed run of this game
When you're an expert at a game that hasn't even come out yet.
The speed-running potential for this game is insane and it’s not even out yet
My target had the demo, and when I started it, the TV was at like max volume or something. Mario yelled “SUPA MARIO ODISEE” on it, and everyone within 30 feet of me stopped and stared at me
This was from the Gamecity in Vienna right?
He was born here
In Super Mario 64 we had long jump spamming. In Super Mario Sunshine we had dive spamming. Now in Super Mario Odyssey we have rolling spamming. History repeats itself.
Make an eshop demo Nintendo!
Wow how often did you play this demo?
3:35 THAT MOVEMENT THO
0:21 Mario jumping Trump's wall.
How do you do the constant rolling?
My target has no demo ;(
Nice run dude! Looks like the rolling is super efficient as I've thought!
SO. FUCKING. EXCITED. I mean fire emblem warriors will be good n all. but odyssey is where it's at
THANKYOU for this content! good movement was all I wanted to see but it's nowhere
Speedrun of demo...
And 3:29 SUPER MARIO GALAXY RETURNS
There are no bad points in this game now!
This is giving the game some really good publicity
I think ground pounding on her head would've wrap the broodal fight up in just two hits.
So far the game isnt out and I can see the speedrunning possiblities are going to be amazing THUMBS UP!!
Dang the game isn’t even out and yet people are already speed running it.
Idk if this is true but I noticed that when you get close to her she’ll back up then attack a lot faster than just waiting for to attack
I can already see this will be great for speedrunning from this alone
this game is going to be so awesome to speedrun, especially 100% run
When you hang out all day at Circuit City playing the demos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4OYXpKxHT4&t=7m52s here is the bomb reflect people are talking about.
I hope speedruns like this stay a thing when the game comes out. 10 min challenges and what not. It'd be fun to watch lol
Basically it's Mario spindashing at sanic speed.
The game is not even out yet and there is a speed run of it XD
I hope this starts a trend.
Holy fuck you are a psycho at this props to u
Damn dude. Great job! Where did u do this?
wow fast make new video
Ohhh god, I actually can’t wait for this game to come out just for the speed runs
i love how mario is sonic now
ROLLING AROUND AT THE SPEED OF WAHOO.
Rolling around at the speed of sound. Oh wait wrong series...
i subscribed & i turned on the notification bell on, when you buy the game when it comes out speedrun it, your gameplay was smart af.
america is so lucky damn
Holy fuck you’re really good!
lmao
guiijiii!
12 days til' Christmas!
Amazing speedrun!
Why do  you Always throw cappy before a Dive  even  when you are not Diving into cappy?
Kool
But first we need to talk about parallel universes.
What?!
Nice run mate
Dude\n\nWhat the fuck
daaaaamn man. Nice!
Awesome!
0:04 sanic gotta go fast
Nice
Great.\nNow do it in 0.5 a presses.
How do you get this demo?
you odyssey this game its amazing
Not fair! The demo at my target ended at 2:25
What buttons do you press to do the rolling move??\n\nAlso what buttons allow you to get back to your hat once you have thrown it?
This is so damn absurd and I love it. This game is gonna make my year.
How do you get the demo
These speed runs make this feel like a true successor to super Mario 64. \nI'm sure some would prefer Galaxy or Sunshine, but this takes the cake.
And how did you get the demo?
I'm worried that the game seems rather empty due to the expansive landscapes not being more filled with objects.
Why can't they have a demo on the switch?? Not in target or Best Buy of Walmart or anything...
this is a record that cannot be broken after the demo stands are beeing removed, you set an unbeatable world record! :D good job
These demos being speedrunned only makes me realise that if the 3D mario game after Odyssey DOES NOT HAVE a cappy equivalent (in terms of jumping toolset), the game will be automatically inferior.
Imagine the poor souls waiting their turns in line behind this guy

You could make a religion out of that.
yeah idk this one was just weird
*I    N     T     E     R     E    S     T     I     N    G*
Do the history of the uk
I’ve lost track of how many times I’ve watched this by now
Were you high when you wrote this
Bill, whatever the fuck you're on bro i want some 😂
was that a fidget spinner
you're a visionary.
Is no one gonna talk about the fidget spinner at 0:36?
You can't even wash Canada because it doesn't exist
you know rather than think about soap (if thats possible) you could have had a bath thanks to that natural disaster......something to think about.
When u found the origin of the fidget spinner
Hello, Mr. Wurtz, could you write a song about being happy because you can look at clowns without upsetting the government?
Most important video I've ever watched.
You can make a religion out of this
Was that a fidget spinner in the jungle? Lol
It sounds sleepy at .5 speed
This was very informative
Does this guys channel remind anyone of a 90s school documentary. Kinda like Bill Nye....when he actually believed in science
Ah, So you are not god themself. I understand now. You are simply a prophet of the soap gods.
Hey, problem the soap didn't work. But the soap did taste good.
I wonder what drugs made this video possible..
0:36 - N O . WHY WON'T YOU DIE
I've no idea what I'm watching but I like it.
I'm from Phil!
This guy can make a 1 minute video about soap and everyone (except 3K people with no sense of humor.) Will love it.
Let's talk about soap. :)
When there drama on YouTube just make a video on soap!😆
So much better than bill nye
I've never been high but I'm pretty sure these videos are what it's like
watch at 0.5x speed, you won't regret it
Don't drop the soap
Is this what it's like to be on drugs
if  you  in  prison,  don't  drop  the  soap!!
My god he's done it again
This is an allegory for something, I don't know what, but it's there.
Don't drop... Never... Even if you are alone. Don't fucking drop
I wonder if there is a deeper meaning behind this.
you'd get more soap...
I mixed soap and soap before. Ended up in a rape dungeon
Thank for the tips
Legit thought the title said soap tits
You technically can make a religion out of this....
Where can I rent me some soap
Am I the only one who saw a cancerous fidget spinner?
United States: oh no its a natural disaster
What happens if you merge the qualities of bar soap and liquid soap? Is there such thing as liquid bar soap?
Not sponsored by the Soap Gods.
0:38 *F I D G E T  S P I N N E R*
Okay, what am I missing?
I’m tryn to find the hidden meaning. The more I search the more I think there isn’t one
Soap...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*wash your house with it*\n*best tip ever 10/10*
Right... What the hell kind of name is Soap, eh? How a muppet like you get past selection?
Is this something you should watch when you are high in order to fully appreciate it?
How stoned do you have to be to watch these videos? I am fucking high as a soap
i kind of want to curl up on a ball on the floor and sob deeply
Bill doesn't always upload\nBut when he does it's the best thing ever
I want to rent a soap, how much will it cost?
You have properly potrayed my race. Good on you.
Can I marry this wise man?
This is a leader of men.
0/10 he didnt turn the natural disaster into a bubble bath
You, an idiot: Soap is used for washing\nBill, an Intellectual:
can you make a video about communism and capitalism
if anyone here likes soap then youre automatically in my heart
I wonder what would happen if you took soap and combined it with soap? You could make a religion out of this.
Is soap a metaphor for drugs? Cause this is some weird shit
... I've lost faith in humanity.
5 VIDEOS IN A YEAR!!!!!!
What did you say? Sorry, I was eating soap soup.
Man, I gotta lay off the acid.
Lets go to Africa and find love in the jungle!!!
First I park my soap\n\nThen I fuck my soap
Who saw the soap a 0:37
The amount of effort that goes into these videos is amazing
This video is from the future
0:36 lol fidget spinner 😂
Soap is my religion
why just why
Luv u

Follow me on Insta for behind the scenes: www.instagram.com/thefoodranger\nWe are continuing our street food journey through Sichuan and making our way to the South of China into Yunnan. We found some incredibly delicious street foods you’re going to love in this video! And one of the SPICIEST things I’ve ever eaten!I would love to hear from you in the comments below too! Thanks so much for watching, and I hope you’re doing well and eating well!
So what do you do with all the large plates of food? Do you eat all of it? Seems like a huge waste of good food if you don't!
“ OHHHHHHH “
why arent you fat? why
oh look more sechuan cooking, yawn
omg...chili overdose...looks very good
gave ti u big fkn dislek
This is a great video, I love the spicy. Keep up the good work.
😍😍you make it seem so easy.you eat everything and not hesitant to try out whatevers offered.. Some food you eat i just squint my eyes while watching bcause no matter how yumm it tastes or cooked i will never eat it especially with some of the food you eat like organs ,frogs etc like damm you must have great genes to handle that😂😂😂
Why do they put MSG in everything?
Ting Ting 🙋
Shokugeki no Soma?
very nice sir
chilli 🌶 😻
Actually my hometown is ZiGong lol
Jiaaaaoooozi baaooooozi lol
Spicy
I only look at the people in the background... they are the best
so wonderful, so good, thank you so much
Have you eaten dog meat?
I KNEW YOU'D PICK LOTUS ROOT
what you are doing is so cool

That blade noodle salad looks so good
Lots of chilies..love it
15:27
nee haaa
Hi James. You getting fat!😂
Just one question. How do you use Facebook in China? I heard that is \nblocked there. :)
love from india trevis nice work come to india pls
hope u enjoy living and eating in China!Ur video is so amazing!
isnt it disrespecting ordering so much and only eating 5% of it ??\n\nI mean thats not america where customer is the king... lol\n\ndid u miss that part in your chinese studies ? this is like really derp
Just watching this and feels like my @$$ is going to fall out.
Please also start documenting where you stay and how you travel like Mark Wiens does.
Bhai Trevor, enough of China yaar. Why don't you show us that side of Canada (ur home) & US street tours. More than 70% of Ur vids are China.
Hi man, have you ever think about posting your video on to some China video website like Bilibili. I think many Chinese are willing to watch your videos.
Plz be here for Nepal too...we have got numerous delicious food!!! Excited to welcome you in the Land of Buddha and Everest.

Who won the 1 million subscriber giveaway? I gotta know it was me!
The camera work should receive an award for this video. It is outstanding.
Hi,Trever,I just happened to see your vedio on the weibo of Chinadaily,and started following U on youtube.:) Cannot wait to see ur new vedioes:D
Do you ever....finish your food? Seems such a waste
Why following the Pennywise look?
We have been watching you for so long, your part of our home. What a cool show.  Keep going to all those cool places so we can visit some day!
Trevor, have you made any videos where you go to a big city, like Shenzhen, and go into a nice restaurant? Not street food but in an upscale sit down restaurant.
my boy trevor getting a little thicc
your video are very short...and seldom too..not unlike before
I'm glad there is still real food somewhere and not the commercial factory produced food in the west concocted in the lab instead of a real kitchens as shown here.
well, I see a certain Trever put on some weights over the last few months ;)
in start of this video, you walking on the street, the sound of your voice is incredible, can you tell me what kind microphone do you use?
Zigong is my hometown, so sweet, love this video.
When Food is too spicy it´s not fun. Eating should be fun and joy.
Just 2 days of net problem in my home, made me miss your videos so much
It's good that you rate how spicy the dishes are, can you do that for the rest of your videos plz?
I think it's not that spicy for me. coz I can't eat without chilli
Makes me hungry!
Ohh man u really did a good job, keep doing....loved ur video, chinese people n u..LOVE from INDIA
You're getting chubby :D I totally understand though, with all that delicious food available to you!
Are u ever planning to go to Korea?
I have never seen so many chillies in one plate 🔥🔥🔥🔥 I don't know how he could have finished that let alone take more than a couple of bites 😣😣😣 I can feel the heat
i love spicy food especially Chili's but this food is going to the extreme did you end up finishing the meal👍👍👍
why don't you try and come to cambodia?
I miss the bum
#46 ON TRENDING Trevoh and his team doing their thing.
Wow first dishes I've seen where chilies are by far the main ingredient. I like chilies in almost everything but I don't think I could handles those.
Please man, can u send me some food through e-mail.... I get hungry watching ur videos even I just had a heavy meal....
I love your videos

9:12 Would love to try the sexy Gangbang noodles!
The food looks amazing but the interactions are just so... Awkward.
This guy is a real boom!! I'm from Zigong, the chicken feet place he went to was one of the most authentic places in my hometown, he must be really serious about his work to even dig that place out!! Cheers dude!!👊
I can't keep watching this. I'm salivating so much.
I can only wonder what my farts would smell like eating like that all the time.
14:11 That's what she said
The thumbnail looked like a chinese food pizza.
you're getting fat trevor. i can see your nips. get some exercise
Wow, as a spicy food lover this looks like Paradise!!! Must do a trip someday :)
I've just watch Shoukugeki no Shouma season 3 and in that episode Shouma learned about spicy Sichuan food and now I found this video! Very interesting!
Haven't watched food ranger's videos for a long time(about a month). So I cooked some scallops and had a glass of wine while I was watching this video. And....\nHey, food ranger, you've got the Sichuaness accent! Do you?
Hahaha I'm Sichuanese. I have to say his Sichuan dialect accent is very funny
I think ur fav place is china
Amazing! China is a place full of great things to explore with exotic foods to savour. Sichuan just makes it top notch.
Just amazing to watch you enjoy the food and the people you meet.
the MSG factor is troubling
Why they put MSG in about everything?
ooohhhhhhhh
Do they even have Mongolian bbq in China?
Jaja I love the song
didn't know they could make me laugh while singing such sad lyrics
m y   c h i l d r e n

The only react videos that matter are from Kylo.
These vids never cease to get a giggle from me lol 😂
I'm so raw!!!
2:48 is the part you want to see.
Star Raws:  The Last Jedi
I can't wait for Kylo to see Blade Runner 2049 and go you're still alive!?
The Suicide Girls at the end....so raw!
That was so Awesome and funny.  I liked how he said this was in the future.  My favorite was when it first switch to Rey.
Chewbacca's face actually looks raw and unfinished
lol!!! i love how he shouts out Whaaat?!!! and that laugh
2:44 ''How about in the ground'' LMAO
I really  enjoy  the Kylo  Ren, I  would  to  see  how  the Hitler reaction  to the Last Jedi  is going  to be  like.
THIS STEAK IS SO RAW, SUPREME LEADER SNOKE WANTS TO TRAIN IT TO USE THE FORCE!
What the hell man, relax.
How about in the ground? Lol 😂 (extends hand) what!?? Hahaha
Last three days word: RAW
I need someone to show me my place...\n*points to the kitchen*
The Auralnauts are 100%  Absolutely Positively Without a Doubt Certified Midichlorified Gugu Mbantha-RAW!\nWhat's Christmas? Lol\nAlso, is that Baby Time playing in the credits?
Gordan Ramsey is super pissed at how raw this trailer is.
This reaction is raw
This video was so RAW
I hope he still reacts to stuff unrelated to Star Wars after Star Wars is over.
It's baby time
I'm really disappointed that weenie doesn't seem to be in his helmet for most of the movie.
“I need someone to show me my place in all of this...”\n\n“How bout in the ground?”\n\nLost it.
I heard lady Gaga really liked this trailer. In fact, she said it was raw raw raw raw  rawwwww.
Chewy is Da Best HAHAHAHA That is All
It's baby time!
How about in the ground?\n\nKylo should have went super savage and said How about in the kitchen?
Ask Charlie Brown. He'll tell you what Christmas is.
Hey Kylo just so you know Star Wars The Last Jedi will be the darkest film of all Star Wars movies just like Empire Strikes Back. So that means the First Order is going to win in this film. I think you will be impressed with this new Star Wars movie Kylo.😀
*chef Ramsay does not approve of this*
We need a Kylo Stimpy 'cos Ren needs a friend.
That was a good evil laugh there.
My helmet is like my favorite thing ever-kylo ren me too, me too kylo
His laugh at the end is killing me.\n\nWHAAT?! HAHAHAHAH!!!
Who is that handsome devil? lol
I hope the BlueRay will also include the *raw cut* when it comes out
This guy does the best kylo vids!
That laugh close to the end
The laugh kills me every time
Episode XII: Attack of the Cyporgs
Was that...couldnt be. Was that motherfucking baby time?
Kylo Ren's reaction to his first time on PorgHub.
Hearing Kylo Ren say kawaii... honestly guys, I did not expect that and it fucking killed me 😂
When he laughed at the end I fucking pissed myself
This guy needs more subscribers
that laugh at the end
I'm glad you like it Kylo
You should make videos of Kylo watching other trailers other than Star Wars. 👍🏽
So RAW.
Definitely gonna be 100% certified on RAWtten Tomatoes
Raaaaaaaaaw
Do it! LOL

Stop sucking dick to get parts in Hollywood all of you ladies.
Ugh
JEWISH SEX TERRORIST IS HARVEY WEINSTEIN
look at that, I cant blame him for trying ;)
Who the hell would watch some old fat dude take a shower? Lol
execute harvey for his crimes
So gross. Has some fetish with being watched taking a shower and beating it. Very weird the way he begs for it. Smh.
So now it seems clear to me that any so called actress who was in his films has revealed themselves to be a PROSTITUTE No MAN would ever sleep with a fat ugly woman no matter how rich or powerful but women on the other hand......
Harvey Weinstein? Hollywood?\nThis happens in every aspect of American business.\n\nThe gambling company IGT is just as corrupt and disgraceful.\nThey protect racists, deviants, con men and would defend paedo's if it made them a buck. \n\nPatti Hart, when she was the CEO of IGT, and former General Counsel Johnson, oversaw and concealed: \n1) The bribery of staff to lie to cover up management criminality \n2) The blackmailing of staff to cover up management criminality \n3) Non-disclosure of evidence in direct contravention of court orders\n4) Perverting the course of justice \n5) Forcing staff, by mandate, to commit perjury in court \n6) And other breaches of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act relating to some suspiciously odd adjudications by equally corrupt judges.
I want justice for the potted plant!
Liberal Hollywood is being Exposed 😈👿☻👻
I know I am going to get heat for saying this, but the fact that so many women stayed quiet rather than call out this predator is truly sad and upsetting. Their silence perpetuated his deviant behavior. In his sick mind, there wasn't anything wrong with it... Why? Because most of the women shrugged it off or were afraid of losing their career. What's more important, values and standing up for what's right or money and Fame? It seems for many the latter, smh.
If the devil had a voice, his is what it would sound like
I just have a question...why now ladies ? Why not when it happened ? Or is it because you liked what he was doing to you ? You all went to bed with thim stop playing victims...
Who taped the conversation between he and the model?
Oh common people. He is not the only pig in the movie industry.
The year of the Weins. First Anthony w...../carlos danger/mr abedin. now HW....
Nasty jew.
He made all this people rich
Can he even find his penis beneath that belly?
Grab her by the pussy.
Maybe he''ll be having a shower with big bubba someday soon.
Weinstein is a sexual predator but the ALMIGHTY HOLLYWOOD protects him and their fellow sexual deviants goyim.\n\nThey thought the Satanic Cult is just a crazy Christian Conspiracy. But this is a hard evidence that several A-listers accused him now.
Don't ruin your friendship with me over five minutes... How simultaneously sad and needy, disgusting and manipulative.
No one should be surprised at what the culture of permissiveness and near naked women and power created. It is also no wonder at the more than 100,000 rapes in this country due to the bombardment of everything having to be sexy.  Virtually everything in the movie industry has an element of sex thrown in and giving something a PG-13 rating will not stop young viewers. Make the ratings and warnings much stronger. God, family and country.
Desperately pleading is NOT what Weinstein was doing, you jackasses. We can assume that headline was written by a man.
But he looks so nice and sounds so nice. (Not about the creepy bit)
A perverted freak exposed and uprooted Praise the Lord
This filthy jew has been raping our Aryan sisters. We must gas the kikes now.
Throw the book at this pervert.
THAT demanding insolent voice is THE DEMON Thats ON HIM TALKING! One demon on him -opens door for lots more. HarveyW IS TOTALLY OVERRUN WITH DEMONS. This guys lord is SATAN. AND NOW satan IS DONE WITH HIM. Devil COMES TO STEAL KILL AND DESTROY! 👎💩👎💩👎
When women singers like the one who used to be Hannah Montana sexually harrasing males none bat and eye, but when a Male do same thing, all of you start complaining about it like a bunch of little kids.
How's the power over women goin Harvey? How's it going?
Yet you all support Hollywood from Woody Allen barely legal adopted Korean daughter to Michael Jackson molesting young boys.  Corey Feldman so messed up (some kind of victim syndrome).  Even Bill Clinton molesting interns as govenor to President.  You all gawk at celebrities as role models?  Why now with McGowen?
No woman is going to have sex with that ugly mug on purpose unless she is blind!
Disgusting Hollywood kike. Deserves to be removed from this planet
Dear God
I dont understand why did they wait so long to sue him and report those facts.
Hollywood seems to be full of very *strange* people , can you guess what group they belong too ? ..Here is a clue ' You can't talk about them '.
Hey can all the anti-Semitism.
That italian chick ruined her chances to become next Hollywood stupidstar...
Whats wrong with desperately pleading with a beautiful model?
Did this nice man maybe upset the wrong jews?
If its only alleged surly you shouldn’t be making a video on it?
Please dont be outraged by Harvey Weinstein if you voted for a president that wants to grab em by the pussy!
A jew protected for decades by Jewry in Hollywood \nNothing to see here
That man looks too dirty for taking shower so often....
Jews have a perverse and degenerative effect on American society
Waiting for a guy to denounce him for sexual harassment too. That would be funny.

a beautiful 22 year old italian model \nthanks for letting us know she was 'beautiful', news. because that's a really valuable and relevant piece of information to a sexual harassment case.
That's not good, of course. But come on! All these celebs would be nobody without his help. And if some of them said No to hime, they said Yes to other perverts.
I hope we can all come together as a country and kill all the people like this including trump :) Happy Murder everyone
What about the allegations of sexual harassment, seems to me not denying it means it’s TRUE
Brave girl. All those pigs should be exposed and put in prison.
They would if they could but they can't, its a c*nt.
He looks like a cancerous elbow.
Dad always told me never go into a room with a jew
He probably didn’t even need the five minutes.
If your president does it what do you expect!
A fat lecherous jew...who would ever believe it?
I was Weinstein's Doorman and Savages's Call screener Jimmy is refusing to put my call through to tell Savage he's wrong in attempting to paint a sympathetic picture of Weinstein now.  How pathetic. Even the Jews 1st in Savage is showing through.
*When  you're a star they let you do ANYTHING*. \nWhen you're the president, you can get away with it too.
Now he just needs some tictaks and he's qualified to be President.
Man, he's got game.
So that's why Mira Sorvino's career tanked - she refused to play with Weinstein's weiner

Harvey Weinstein is NOT a pig\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is toilet scum.
What's wrong with you people?!\nShe's full of age, he wants sex, so what? She could have left anytime.\nJust because he's ugly yet rich doesn't make it a crime.
did he grab her pussy? \n(did he ask first?)
Still...not nearly disgusting as Comrade Trump, who RAPES America EVERY DAY.\n\nBOOT OUT ALL republicons, NOW!
Women sell their bodies to corporate heads to get a head start in there careers. Then when they don't get anywhere, they scream RAPE to make a buck.
Weird that it was recorded....... he didn't force her so....... you telling me if you had a model in your hotel room that you wouldn't try to seduce her? wth was she even doing there? You say pig I say trying his luck, yh he sunk low but who hasn't?
Thanks, man. We need this. I'd never heard him mocking the pronunciation of Puerto Rico. I can only watch him speak within the context of your videos - otherwise, I just have to read the stories. He's too gross.
I can foresee this getting 1,000,000 views by November who agrees like if u agree
Shared on Facebook, well done and keep them coming.  We are Canadian but we still think they are great.
HILARIOUS..This guy is sooooo talented...great job...and guess what: he is right, with every word he sings
Oh My GOD, Randy this is your best ever, you have really outdone yourself this time!!!\nxoxox
This video is awesome - can't stop laughing every time I watch it.
RANDY YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL AGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhh
Can you post these lyrics up somewhere?
I hope Trump gets to see this. He'll probably try to ban YouTube.
Brilliant!
Yes, bleep-o.
I FREAKING LOVE THIS OH MY GAWD !
Good Boy!!!
IM DYING THIS SONG IS SO GENIUS AND FUNNY
Oh my goodness Randy, I have tears running down my face, that is brilliant! keep doing what you’re doing, you make this administration more bearable.
😆😆😆 this is so hilarious! You sir, just got a new subscriber 👍
I can't stop watching this....it is that good!
😂😂😂oml! I got it to 9k❤
I've now come back to watch this three times. So good
Omg... When I had first seen this I blew water all over my laptop busting into laughter! Like my new favorite song. Ahahaha...
Poor Trump. This must be the first time he ever tried to pronounce a word in a language other than English.  Someone must have tried hard to teach him the pronunciation and get him to pick it up accurately.  But they failed.
All those dislikes I will hunt u down and dislike u
Every thing u said is sooo true
Im so happy right now
The only reason there are dislikes is because people are mad that they didn't write this.
Good day,\n\nHAHAHAHAHA!!!\n\nThank You The tragedies are horrible, but this Yellow Bodied Cowardly LiAR-ito....\n\nThank you for your time.
Randy Rainbow is so pretty.
This guy needs to be a guest on SNL!
That song describes Donald Trump in every single way
I love this song. It's intelligent, hilarious, and spot on. Plus, Randy, you are just adorable and fun to watch!
Been having a bad week, for about a year now!  ... In and out, in and out, three times - okay well lets not get into your sex life!\nLMAO! This is amazing!
I died at you're this color. I went to Home Depot, and the sign made me think about this video. I laughed so hard that I farted.
I solemnly dedicate my golf trophy to the victims of Hurricane Donald.\n\nRandy Rainbow, you're a light in the darkness. And a genius. And I love you.
Funny, but even funnier is Hilary's book!  How come everyone knows What Happened except her?
8000 to 142. Yeah, I think you nailed this one too. :D
You're my favorite human.
Who are the 141 people that disliked this? Is it Trump disliking it on numerous devices?
OMFG Randy's voice is amazing. Me and my daughter keep this song on repeat 😂 grabby braggadocios creepo is perfect
From France : you are a genius ! ;) xoxoxo
You may possibly be the Wind Beneath My Wings
thank you. MY NEW FAVORITE SONG! awesome
A guy from Puerto Rico Hit like on this video! Good!
I heard Justin Bieber did a parody of this song
I'm a fan for sure!  You freekin killed it.  Thanks from all of us Puerto Ricans!!!
It starts at 1:07 ur welcome
Thank you Randy!  Just love and appreciate you so much!
Randy’s wig is more convincing than Trump’s, and I can see the zipper.
😂😂😂😂😂😂 can't stop laughing, this is genius
Make a parody about him but using the song rolex
So funny everything you said is Correct about him
You're very good and very talented if you haven't been on Broadway yet you should be. Keep up the good work!
I showed all my friends this even my teacher and know my user name is desperate Cheeto
OMG, THIS IS THE BEST YET! LMBO!
Randy, you are so cool!
This parody is better than the real song.
Much better than the original
Yass this is my favorite song
You're a crabby, unproductive creep-o Killed it!!!
This is completely disrespectful to our president. I am utterly disgusted. Jk! I don't give a shit!! Best video ever, although I must say the Steve Bannon one was classic!! 😂😂👌
Hilarious as usual. Thank you Randy, just what the doctor ordered 😂
We got very high marks! we got A+ pluses Good Boy ahaha\nthe feeling you get when you get A+ on your math test or any other subject :D
I love all your songs but I can't stop singing this one 😉😘😍❤
Your vocal range, is amazing...always in awe
I can’t stop watching this. I’ve listen to it about10 times now and I still want to listen to it again. Randy you’re addictive.
Randy I found your glasses and got them!!!👓👓👓👓
Randy, you are a musical and comedic genius. I adore your uploads!!!
I would really like to know if anyone in the Current Regime watches these videos.
I would have your children if I had a uterus
Cheeto thinks he is a smart-O when he tries his fake accent to say Pwetoh Wiko! Fuckin moron. \nThank you for the laugh Randy!
Wonderful, Randy!
You go randy
Awesome!
DESPERATE CHEETO IS AWESOME
I hate trump
THIS IS GENIUS 😂😂😂😂😂
And hilarious!
This is Fucking hilarious

Sweet voice!!
YYAAASSSSS
Genius.    Yep.
TEARED so much HAHAAHAHHAAHAHHAAHHAAHAHHAHAA
Well done!
Randy keeps me sane
Down with donald duck trump
Whats funnier the song or this faggot liberal. Too bad a total flame ass made this , funny parody but this is last guy/girl to make fun of anyone
Making fun of the President isn't going to get you anywhere especially your career.  Have some pride in yourself or maybe you have a little too much of the WRONG pride.
Ah, Randy Rainbow, what was my life before I found you?  Personally, I blame my sister because she's been a fan for ages and never bothered to mention it lol <3
bless whoever carved dat pumpkin at 3:38
I could listen to you all day Randy.
My blood still boils and my BP rises at the disregard for human lives by this terrible horrible despicable man somehow elected as president. The nerve of a person with limited language skills and who can only speak one language at 4th grade level to mock those of us with accents and the loving way we pronounce our country's name is 'insoportable'.  Randy's parodies help me put things in perspective and bring my anger to a manageable level and my BP lower. He makes me laugh and I feel better all day.
YOU  SUCK...LMAO
Still your president
Still better then hillary
A bit racist isn't it?  The next time there's a black president, will it be okay to poke fun at his skin?
A few flat earthers die of heart ache after each spacex video :)
wow Echostar 105? I worked at the company way back when they launched Echostar VI and VII.
90 flat earthers and some SpaceX competitors disliked this video
Like 2 more Elons and we'll be set.
Great work! Congrats to the whole team at SpaceX.
Steady for a while at max speed at around 8000 kph. With this speed, we can reach Mars in 2.85 years. Not that long...and worth to wait
The technology and equipment are good...
Wow! Kerbal Space Program has great graphics since the last updatr
Every time Tom (the host) comes on and says he is a Firmware engineer all i here is, I am a Former Engineer and my first thought is WHY ARE YOU HOSTING THEN!?
Can I suggest that when you make your rocket to mars that you create a component called The Illudium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator?

Why don't you ever show a launch from the camera of a satellite or satellites? So we could see the whole operation   of launching to landing.
Saw it from my back yard, 168mi south of the Cape. Awesome!
It's really wonderful. When I'm watching when this rocket is returning from space and landing, I feel like I'm watching the next chapter in space exploration. Congratulations to SpaceX. Elon Musk, I do not think you have time to read the comments, but you know how to inspire people.
Are there people inside?
2017 and Space companies are still using potatoes to record :/
Anyone wanna explain the space-blizzard at 41:00?
So is it time to start buying spaceX stock?
SpaceX makes NASA look like the overpaid old timers afraid of change they are.
ArianeSpace and ULA are toast! \nSpaceX ate their lunch with Falcon 9. It's a very successful launch technology and SpaceX is already leaving it behind. \nNow Elon will show up the SLS with BFR! \nI cannot wait to see those things coming out of the sky and landing on a launch pad.
WoW was this fastest re-entry  ? Fins glowing white and plasma show up..... WoW
what if it flies over north korea and they get the wrong idea
what the hell is that camera doing ? seriously? you send rocket to space and you cant tilt the camera steadily?
Point of order!!!! You are not launching from Cape Canaveral. KSC is technically on Merritt Island. ;-)
How I love these starts.. more please! Also: Mars! I hope once the crew is on it's way there are daily videos of how things going - will watch it! Nothing boring in pushing the boundaries of mankind :)
İ Choice The Blue Pill   Morpheus  Musk !!
Subtitles seem to be about 11 minutes behind the audio(!)
SpaceX  you need a concert like TOMITA Live at Linz in Austria 2 as you send off  :)
Ah thought they had lost the first stage there for a minute would have been there first failure is a while when it was starting to look like they may have got landing the first stage down pat, they return 69 on them and they will have a better return success rate than the space shuttle, if we cut off the earlier failures which I would because the Falcon 9 is a refined rocket compared to the original Falcon 9, it's not the same machine really.\n\nAlthough having a better track record than the space shuttle is not exactly a compliment, I would like to see the Falcon 9 get to a 100,000 consecutive successful missions without a failure which was the original rating for the space shuttle... which was a bit off. But it probably wont reach that even if it never fails again because BFR should eventually be able to take over for it expect for when you need a launch window which BFR will not be ready for, because I assume that a BFR will be in maintenance for at least 6 months between maybe 5 launches and landings so if you have a fleet of 5 for example that would only give you 50 launches per year so if you need a specific launch window you will probably be shit out of luck, which is why you will still need a few Falcon 9's and Falcon Heavys laying around even if/when BFR has demonstrated it's reliability.\n\nUnless they are going to have a fleet of 37 BFR's to cover every day of the year, and building and maintaining 4-5 BFR's is already ambitious.
Its weird that Tesla cars actually accelerate faster, if you compare them side by side. The rocket just keeps going. I imagine the time when we will launch stuff to space from huge magnetic cannons, made out of hyperloops that then ignite while already hundreds of meters above ground and going just a little under speed of sound already. Could save alot of liftoff fuel payload.
This is not Russia vs America... This humanity vs extinction  ... We are all brothers and sisters... Indian guy here going I could be a part of space x some day... :D
The Russians are known for their secrecy.
Reusing rockets: what's the big deal - I do it on Kerbal all time, and with a real short turn around time: you say this is not the same thing???? ;) Congrats Elon - and people say: What can one person do? Well how about changing the whole world and much for the better?
Excellent choice of music.
I would like to see G forces too in the telemetry section. Would be a nice thing to visualize acceleration.\n\nThumbs up if you want it too! :D
elon is actually a Martian just trying to get back home. :(
You are the best
I recently flew on a 4 engine 747... can't imagine 20 engine's and how I would possibly survive, LOL!!!
I can understand camera getting screwed on re-entry, but surely the barge camera can have better than potato quality/connection. Still, awesome work. Look forward to much more and oneday seeing 31 raptor engines firing in all their glory.
Its so complicated to do, yet this video makes it look so easy.  Musk is a force of progress.
Elon Musk is the greatest foreigner to come to America since the time of Nikola Tesla. Bravo Mr. Musk.\nWish you lots of luck on your endeavors.\nIf you take advantage of everything America has to offer there's nothing you can't accomplish- Geraldine Ferraro
It's a bit strange that it cut out on the landing.
if they develop this rocket any further they might just go to the moon some day!
@23:40 In space, they play techno.
Why is the drone ship named Of Course I Still Love You?
i cannot wait for the BFR
Watched it live couldn't comment at time shame visuals were lost of rocket landing but seen most of its journey well done
All bow down to Elon Musk our savior. What I would give to work with him....He will save the world.
Best\nName \nFor\nA\nDroneship
I just love SpaceX! What an extraordinary gang! They just do it :D.\nWould have been nice to see some telemetry data from the 2nd stage during its long flight.\nBut a great presentation anyway. I love watching these launches!
Is it just me or did they attach new cameras, way better quality this time around
others can gripe but SpaceX is showing the way forward efficient to the point of 2 launches in 3 days 2 returns in 3 days multiple satellites launched without drama, they are a trucking company doing what they do best, and by developing their own equipment they control quality, remember the plan for BFR is the equivalent of launching a decent sized 4000 ton ship into orbit and reusing it as well multiple times, we really are at a crossroads
I love the drone ship names...\nOf Course I Still Love You\nJust Read the Instructions
13:54 Thank me later...
Such a beautiful takeoff!

Super décollage, bravo à vous.
The most amazing transportation vehicle and its formed like a penis
@spacex is that the first stage landing at 22:12 on the left side one the screen?
What is on the horizon at 22:12? It looks like a nuke detonation.
I wish they would display m/s instead of km/h
Lots of space junk visible on the left camera as the 1st stage is prepping for return to earth. That's going to be a problem pretty soon I would say.
every day seems they send something up...the elite moving out?
I bore my other half to tears alot of the time when I talk about Elon Musk and the whole Space X operation... Not to mention those phenomenally stunning Tesla vehicles. He is a true visionary willing to risk his own wealth for mankind to step foot and even reside on Mars... Obviously it would mean a stupendous amount of wealth WHEN it succeeds. Would love to sit and have a coffee and chat with Elon. I admire his focus and drive on getting us to the red planet. I'm 99.999% sure Space X will get the first structure on Mars ahead of NASA.
What's the nuclear bomb looking thing in the background at 22:12
@43:40 can somebody please explain why the speed of second stage is decreasing? Shouldn't it remain constant?
***NEED AN ANSWER: *** so when the stage 2 rocket is activated the traveling speed starts to go up quickly as there is few friction in the atmosphere at 300km altitude. At minute 42:02 immediately the speed stops to 35'262 km/h and then starts going back. How this? An object launched at so high speed how can instantly stop?????!!! Shouldn't have a continuos movement as there is no friction!?  Thanks to all for answer
Why did they land on the barge instead of land?  I thought land was preferable now that it has been figured out
Where does the second stage end up going? Does it just drift endlessly now?
Ok...what happened at 14:55?
What is that at 22:13 on the edge of the Earth?   Is that the sun? Or stage 1?  Sorry if that's a silly question.
It looks like Elon Musk is playing Kerbal Space Program !
Thanks for a very interesting and informative video. \n\nI am curious.. After the satellite has been released, what do you do with the part of the rocket, carrying the satellite? Do you fly it back into the earth' atmosphere, so it burns up and falls into the ocean or that happens with it? \n\nIf that is the case, how much is left when it hits the water. Are we talking parts of a few centimeters or more?\n\nKeep up the good work. I love what you are doing to the world.
Excuse me, I've got a question (and maybe a stupid one, because I don't know what could be the answer). Instead of focusing and spending so much money on reaching Mars, wouldn't be better to focus on asteroid mining technology? I think that once that we will be capabel to gain materials in the space, we will be able to build our rockets directly in space, so that the ammount of fuel needed will be much less becouse we will have no more to escape our gravity.\nHope that someone could clarify me that point.
Flat ?
SpaceX should send a new rocket to space everyday
weird looking rocket. lot of fancy paintings but still less than half as good as Russian rockets which take off so beautifully, very safe and reliable, unlike this american junk. here's how a rocket should take off: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzsRjru86s

is there anything in your rockets with batteries? like the most normal AA batteries. it'd be so hilarious...\nlike Energiser, the Most Space Batteries Ever Made (Elon Musk award) and stuff.\noh the agony of my normal side.
elon ! you are gettıng lame  hahahha
20:59 Damn is this plasma ?? Good thing the first stage survived reentry
CGI is getting so realistic
The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, friends! \n\nRepent of your sins and put your faith in Jesus. \n\nHe Loves you, so please do not listen to the lies of the devil. Jesus Loves you so much, He died so that you may live. \n\nJudgement is swiftly approaching, and the Only Way to escape is through Jesus Christ. \n\nSo please, if you haven't called upon The Lord, do so today. You will be forgiven. You will be saved. You will be renewed! \nHe promises to never drive you away, so please don't listen to men and women, instead seek Jesus. He is all you need! \n\nShalom, friends.
There is an imperfecto ruler right now and nobody gets it either.
Legend has it that his brain is a Klein bottle
Awwwww, Metriiic!  Do I have toooooo!?\n\nI don't know how I would have handled this as a student.
I would conjecture that the likely enduring memory of his students would not relate to mathematics, but rather be something along the lines of, Trust less.
theres holes in the paper
Paper size nerd. The second he gave the measurements, I knew something was off.
I think if you get Cliff Stoll and Matt Parker together, tell them go off come up with something together in secret, you have 3-12 months, as needed, the result would be *spectacular!*
Hey Numberphile, so I found this geometric puzzles called Euclidea. You can feature some problems there. It will be interesting to watch mathematicians doing that game.
That guy is a beauty
Cliff, if you teach a math class at school, I would gladly drop everything and go back to school, that school to be specific
Make a model of the paper and measure the paper with photographs and electron beams and write some simple software to measure the output and report on surface area. Measure model map I always say. Thanks for the Hilbert quote. We will know!!
Can you fill a klein bottle with watter?
I don't really know about doing an integral, but couldn't I just measure and subtract the area of the triangles that are made when the papers are lined up? 1:45
HOW DID HE EXPLAIN OWNING AN IPHONE I NEED TO KNOW
It was Hilbert: Wir müssen wissen, wir wereden wissen, in response the the Latin maxim igroamus et ignorabimus (we do knot know and we will not know).\n\nI hate not being able to solve a puzzle. It will consume me until I know. This is a trait I have in common with a very large number of scientists and engineers. I think it's innate rather than taught. Some people are happy not to know.
How on earth can he forget Hilbert's name?
I would use a scanner to determine the area. Would just need to determine how much area each pixel is.
I feel like noticing the trapezoid paper (and the innacurate ruler) is one of the few things that would be easier in American units, because our papers are all 8.5x11, so when you start measuring and it's 8.45x10.9, something's wrong. If it's 8.45x9.9, there's something very wrong.
This was exactly how I got a job as a sound tech in college! They asked why I wanted the job with no experience, I just said, every time I walk by a sound board, I want to know what all those knobs do.\nThe real answer was that I didn't want to work in the dish pit, but I got in regardless.
Can numberphile make a video on infinity - infinity =π
Clifford Stoll is a Ph.D. astronomer. But back in 1986, while employed as a systems administrator at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Stoll investigated a tenacious hacker, one who stole $0.75 of computer time (back when you had to rent computer time-no one owned computers back then)—later identified as a KGB agent—who stole passwords, pirated multiple computer accounts, and attempted to breach US military security. \n\nStoll was tenacious and needed to KNOW even then-I mean, how many people would devote months trying to find a $0.75 accounting error?\n\nAfter identifying the intrusion, Stoll set up a honeypot for Hess, eventually tracking him down and passing details to the authorities. It is recognized as one of the first examples of digital forensics. He described the events of his investigation in The Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage, which was a huge international best seller, and is an excellent book that I highly recommend.
For a moment I thought I was watching Julias Sumner Miller. Those were the days.
i was a little sad about my future, but after i watched this, it encouraged me.
This guy is what indiana jones would look like when teaching
Cliff is great, would have liked to have had him as a teacher for sure. Enthusiasm is important
This is beautiful, Cliff
My first thought was the ruler tbh.
This guys brain is wired just like mine
I like that feeling
I want to ask that guy a question
Is the Earth pear shaped?
Why don’t more teachers do this? You know, make students think. This man is brilliant.
So enthusiastic about his work.. I Really like him...mathematically speaking..
have he done a video about everyone is 7 handshakes away from the president? i found that odd
i love this guy
This man looks like Einstein on weed
Acting outlandishly can get you a fair bit of mileage.
This guy should have a TV show only for himself
I thought that one of the interpretations would include measuring the depth of the paper by folding it and using the depth to find the area of its edge-like sides.
He should be collecting royalties off Dr. Emmett Brown.
How is this man still not knighted?
the moment I saw the homework assignment, I immediately thought that I would measure it by attempting to cut a shape of known area, and weighing that piece. Then weighting the whole sheet and multiplying by the known mass per a unit of area (this is how we used to do it for figuring the area under a chromatography trace.)\n\nFor the sides, I was thinking I would cut the paper into several pieces and stack them, to get the thickness of the paper, but I am not sure how precisely the cut edge of the paper matches its thickness.
I still don't know how to meassure the paper properly now.
This guy is AMAZING !!!!
I knew he was probably gonna tell me that measuring a piece of paper may not be as streight forward as I think... but this.. I didn't expect this..... awesome.
and no students notices that with that definitely Trumpfakish ruler, the usual 20x27cm sheet of paper measured... 20x26cm ;-) (check on the video)
Morty! Marty!! We have to go back to the future Marty to get back to the past to fix the present
He is weird, but amazing!
Can someone help me find a value of n that works other than 2:\nn^3-1= prime #
This is the opposite of click bait
This video probably had a larger impact on me than 4 years of high school teachers. Education is so much more than standardized tests and memorization. It's about learning how think and feel and react. This was beautiful.
This 5 minute video conveys a sense of scientific rigor so amazingly well!\nI love this so much, I emailed it around the intro physics lab department at my university yesterday morning.  This morning, we're talking about maybe using this as the first lab of the fall semester for next year's program.\n8th grade?  The lessons in this video apply at all levels of research.
o didn't think you'd be an iPhone guHILBERT DAVID HILBERT
That's really educational!\nBtw, I was unintentionally expecting a cry of Great Scott lol
He goes on about the desire to know things, only to go all around trying to find that mathematician's name. That's one way to show you stick to your philosophy!
3:50 This is something that comes natural in CERTAIN areas. For some people its science others its math, others its English.
Omg I love this Cliff guy so much! So full of energy and you can really tell he loves his work. I wanna be like Cliff when I grow as old as he is.
Find the minimum value of (10a+13)^1/2+(10b+15)^1/2 given that a+b=10
This is the kind of teacher I aspire to be.
Can Cliff Stoll be my professor?  Please?
I would assume there would be some chance that the students results in many cases would not match based on which edges they measured.\nSo then, have them explain why . This would be interesting to observe.\n\nMight experiment on my kids ... now where do i get an imperfecto  ruler.  Must be one in my garage somewhere.
I really wish I had been a student in one of Cliff's classes. He has such great enthusiasm for everything and I love his take on maths and sciences! Every Numberphile video I watch featuring him makes me super happy and pumped! If he ever did an encore class, I'd do everything in my power to attend as I envy his former students!
I would love to have him as a teacher
I was surprised to see it’s not a rant by Matt Parker!
The one thing I must know is who would dislike this video.
Is there a place where we can get like a PDF copy or something of the imperfecto ruler he uses, or is it a secret of cliff only
I'm almost certain that drive for knowledge is learned, not a natural gift. If you've got it, some event in your past showed you learning how to discover a fundamental truth is empowering in any future dealings with the subject of that truth.
Got to know things is a great way to live. Thanks Cliff
I adore this Professor.  His enthusiasm is infectious.  And his mind is deep and scary and wonderful.
I love Cliff.  He's just so enthusiastic and it's contagious
I love this guy, he's so animated and engaged.
The Klein bottle guy. You are Awesome..
15-16 people in each class, hHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Cliff both looks like and has the same speech patterns as Rick Sanchez.
I want to be his student
Great advice for youngsters, and others too.
I actually hired someone not once, but twice for two different companies because he said in the first interview “I don’t know, but I know I can figure out the problem if I had more time and the right tools.” This was after he tried to trouble shoot a timed, and impossible to solve, hardware problem (yes I rigged it).
I love him so much 💗💗💗
His students are lucky.
I loved this!! What an awesome guy! And super interesting
Homework every night? No thanks
This is sooooo cooooool!!!!
What a delightful person.
Yes.
Savage Klein bottle guy
We love parker square!
This guy is sooo cool.
Klien bottle guy!
Fantastic
Do modulo inverse plssss :”((
Real life Doc. Brown
Cliff reminds me of doc brown
Cliff rocks!
I feel cheated.
YAYYYY CLIFF!!!
Amazing! :D
Mad genius
Inspiring guy
1.21 jiggawatts
great advice! I was caught.\ner. why two '17' on the ruler? lol. about the wrong 'tool' to use?

Alhamdulillah (All praise be to Allah)or God if yur arabic. . Yu dont have to be Muslim to say this. saying something in a different language doesnt change its meaning much. arabic doesnt mean Muslim either. unrelated but somewhat related to Islam at the same time.

Reminds me of the ruff Ryder anthem video
Has to be one of the hottest song of 2017.
FIRE ASS VIDEO!!! FERG U & KIRK KILLED THIS
He got dram in this
anyone know the name of the song at the start?
I used to work for a place that did the warranties for Tourneau watches.
Yo where did they get that juicy j verse ????????
Greets from Germany. Listening since dead prez and wu tang but this is the shit. back to the 90s
This song makes my TV watch me.
Sounds like a Project Pat song
I feel like rocky & skepta would kill this beat on a remix
ride with the mob , ALHAMDULILLAH  , i like that my nigga
Emilie Brooklyn why she go so crazy 😜🔥🔥
if you like this, check out my new single if you have time <3
Ri looks so fine in her cameo bruh oh lawd

This shit bump!!!!!!
Played this at my school, and I’m still paying off fines for setting of the fire alarm
That Juicy J verse at the beginning was 🔥🔥🔥
That sample in the beginning with juicy j, where is that from? Tried searching the lyrics, but no dice. Help will beappreciated, thanks.
i think ferg and this song would get a lot more views if it was well directed, produced, and filmed. i love ferg and the mob but if you didn’t know your shit you’d think this vid was from 2013
🇹🇷🎤👍
Is that the Bronx?
A Line Rider video, with a million views, in 2017? What timeline is this?
Holy shit this is incredible
This is genuinely one of the coolest things I have ever seen on YouTube.
One of the best I ever seen. Well done sir!
The friction burn starting at 2:03  x.x
i love the ending
Wow I love the last 30 seconds where the rider and the vehicle are separately falling yet still on the rhythms!! Amazing job!
I loved it! One question: what happened at 2:16? There's some extra music
What Is the name  of song?
this is honestly one of the coolest things i have ever seen you should be hecka proud
Somebody posted the video, can you take legal action?\nhttps://youtu.be/4mg550QTUqo
Great job.  You have really given a lot of people a small joyful experience.  Thank you.
i wanna see a zoomed out pic of the whole map
Outstanding! This made me feel the intensity of the track with the line rider. Kudos and well done.
that's a genius work, you know
DoodleChasos, THANKS for making my day, week, month & year!!  This was over-the-top creative, splendid and awesome.  Deja Vu swept over me as this was the song I played my sophomore year of high school on a SOUSAPHONE (Tuba like) in a state music instrument contest!  Sally Forth Line Rider, you're the BEST.
I completely lost it. Incredible.
DoodleChaos, can you contact me regarding this video? I can't find contact information on your channel. Thanks so much.
When is Line Rider gonna make a comeback?
Wow this was so amazing.  I can see lots of work was put into this.  This is amazing and it deserves the 1 million views it got!
Bravo! BRAVO! Best thing I've seen in some time!!
ride of the valkyries next pls
this is one of those videos where i cant understand why you would dislike it
That's awesome. Thank you very much.
Yeah.. sheet music is still hard for me, I'm not getting it :(
Please do more.  This was immensely satisfying and I'm like on my 10th+ watch.
Is.. Line Rider making a comeback?
This is soo cool. Great job!!
is this Baby Driver?
Feeling bad for empathizing too much with the guy on the sleigh
This is the most impressive thing I've seen all week
Fabulous, fabulous work. Brilliant. I wish you massive success.
Was not satisfied at 2:05-2:08 where the little dude slid by his body
I got anxiety watching this, it's scary.
Without a doubt one of the best things I've seen on YT omfg
Want to watch more classic songs line rider!!!\nLike Nutcracker ;D
make one for the second movement of shostakovichs 8th string quartet haha
THE ENDING DRUM ROLL IS BEAUTIFUL
This took him a month to make and it's so perfect\nif you don't share this you basically have no soul lol
No way! This was insane! Personally my favorite was the end part, especially where all the little dots made the dude speed up. I think I had this game when I was young, and it was VERY fun! Great video!
Spend a month making an amazing video: 1m views\nTake said video and reupload it to a Facebook page: 50+m views \n\nDoes this frustrate you or are you happy that the video gets attention even if it's not on your platform? Curious.
I couldn't stop smiling this made my day.
This is incredibly brilliant, and so beautifully illustrates the way great music evokes feelings and images! I hope you all take a few minutes to watch, and enjoy it as much as I did!
Time for my daily viewing of this video.
Must've started working on this when linerider was still popular
Please! more classic music <3
This is the pinnacle of human achievement
This is absolutely fantastic! Well done.
Beautiful!  Can you zoom out to show the whole thing the poor fella went through?  Great job.
Holy hell, this is still a thing?
I can’t imagine spending so much time on something I wouldn’t get paid for. Just kinda hurts to think about how little money he received for so much hard work.
I did not even blink once. Damn, imma get into that shit some more
Brilliant work! are the numbers supposed to mean something?
What are those numbers supposed to mean?
It would be cool to see the score painted in the background.
Love it. Brilliant and funny.
How is this song called?
DId john cage wrote this?
Great !
Well done!
WHAT
Amazing!  :)
well, then.
I love Fantasia
I love it how the music just fits
I can't stop watching this and it's been like 3 days.
Brought back all my nostalgia from playing this game back in the day, and did it with an utterly AMAZING bit of work. Bravo and a thousand internets to you, good sir!
Yes, I enjoy!  Thank you.
Genius!
I have never seen anything in gaming that was as amazing as this. No kill streak, not that USS Enterprise that those people made in Minecraft, not the Madden championships, nothing. The person that made this is a gaming legend.
most entertaining video of 2017
lol nice
Love.
Знаете, это очень точная иллюстрация средне-статистического рабочего дня российского дизайнера )))\nМульт просто гениальный!
It`s amazing

Pure genius!

This is awesome!!!
https://www.reddit.com/r/SyncedtoMusic/comments/76h6r1/line_rider_mountain_king/
Bravo!
this is truly amazing. I'm not even being facetious; I truly believe this is amazing. the amount of passion and effort that went into this is astounding and astonishing. the way you capture every string and every drum is absolutely magnificent. the simple vividness of this is just so incomprehensible there's hardly words to describe it. the way you emphasize and visualize the tempo and the beat with the draw of the bow strings and the strike of the drums, all with some geometric shapes! it's so unbelievably gorgeous. the way the build-up to the final stanza is visualized through him just careening through the air at break neck speed is something that really echoes with me. this is honestly the best thing to come out of line rider, and the sheer creative driving force powering this insane creation is so beautiful. I am no fan of modern art, but this is truly art and this is beautiful. maybe I am overanalyzing this but I truly believe this is something that deserves to be seen all over. this is what true creativity, true passion looks like. I love this and I love you. keep up the good work and many thanks for allowing my mortal eyes to see this. you have distinguishable and immensely powerful talent.
SWEET VOICE = KIM SE-JEONG!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Douyoung's voice......it's so healing\nSejeong,'s  voice....so beautiful \nThe MV....perfection to the point of no words
So....I'm crying. Welp, thanks SM. This was so pretty and beautiful and adorable omg.
OH MY GOD THE PLOT WAS THE CUTEST THING \n\nbc those drinks were from an actual nct video!! with doyoung, haechan, and winwin (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE5LTiGIteE) ;;; so it's like sejeong's not an idol and doyoung falls in love with the coffee shop girl. THAT'S ADORABLE. \n\ni loved sejeong's clips she's so cute it makes me cry please give God Sejeong lots of love she's nothing but an angel
Godsejeong with her soft-angelic-husky voice  matches well with this song 😍
God sejeong 💜💙💚💛❤
i ship this couple
damn they look so good together  ♥♥♥
Sejeong was impeccable. The guy sound so vocally weak. Ruined it for me.
The revert back scene reminded me of la la land
I really really love it.It is refreshing to my ears.
I don’t know if I’m more jealous of Doyoung or Sejeong 😫❤️
Doyoung looks like Lee Hyun Woo. Am I the one?
you can hear and see the la la land influence (esp from 2:42)
It gives me 'La La Land' vibe 😍
their sound are so sweet. awwwwww so cute
I want them to be dating now but it'll never happen
Song kind of gives me la la land feels
This kinda reminds me of la la land because of its light and sweet music. Love this song!!!
THAT INTERLUDE GAVE ME LA LA LAND FEELS OH MY GOD I LOVE THIS MUSIC VIDEO TOO MUCH UGH I LOVE EVERYTHING IN THIS MV
Ah Doyoung's vocals kills my very soul...
In love with Doyoung voice

도영이는 갈수록 잘생겨지고~~\n세정이는 갈수록 여신여신~~^^
they're both so adorable dnabhdn I love this song so much\nTheir voices sound so beautiful together which makes this song so amazing\n\n\nAlso I didn't know that sejeong had such a pretty voice like I see her everywhere because of her visuals but her voice is just as beautiful
the next thing you know there's news of them dating lmao who knows tho\nplus, both song and video gives back the 'la la land' feels and yES i'M CRYiNG
you wanna be quite precise so 8,9 or 10 minutes
Can we make a Swiss roll with a giant raisin on top?
It has to be nice to have so few allergies in one's circle of acquaintances that dairy free poses a problem. I once made a birthday cake that was nut free, egg free, gluten free, chocolate free, berry free,  stone fruit free and that did not contain lactose, in order to accommodate all the allergies and intolerances within the party-goers. Wasn't the BEST thing I've ever baked, but 1000% worth the effort to see everyone's delight when told that No, there's no gluten/nuts/eggs/etc in there, so you can eat it.
I'm proud of you lads for making it to Trending with just a midweek recipe
Ricegum took the L
#FindJeremysDairyFreeGirlfriend2k17
 You're knocking off my nuts \n*Ben giggles silently*
Is vanilla paste different from vanilla extract?
every time i watch this channel i get so hungry and want to eat what they made
Now technically... none of us should suck the tit of another animal into adulthood (or ever).
in Chile we call that brazo de reina, which means queen's arm
Any chance of you guys making Wagamamas Firecracker Chicken one day?
Yep, I'm gonna hold off for another five seconds cause I always end a little... too... early. Oh, look look look, nearly nearly nearly. Nuts are going in!
Thank you for the dairy free recipe
Where on earth do you find hazelnut milk!!!?!?!!
my name is Jeremy But no girlfriend hard r i p.
You're knocking off my nuts ;)
You come for the recipes - you stay for the puns
Hmm...reading a comment I had an idea.  These things rarely escape so I hope this is a good one.  Here goes...How about an education week?  Teaching a class or feeding the 5000 in a dinner school or students restaurant.  Best foods for learning etc.  I'm sure that students will love it.  Well, how did I do?  Oh...OK.   Sorry, I think I'll just go off and disappear.
“And then you wanna grab yourself (long pause) a tray lined with paper.” 😂
JEREMY YOU IDIOT i died
Stoked to see your flavour choice!  Hazelnut and coffee is one of my absolute favourite combos. Thanks for the shout out :)
Love how he explains the reason for each ingredient/action!
Did anyone notice the head-wiggle Ben always does while or after saying sorted?
Any suggestions if you can't have eggs or dairy? 😥😥😥 I've the worst allergies :(
I’m Jeremy’s girlfriend literally
I live in Switzerland but never ate that
Hiya guys love your channel. Would you be able to make baba ganoush at some point? I love it and would really like to see your version. It's good as a dip but I love it with spicy roast lamb too thanks 😉
The best things about dairy-free and/or vegan recipes is that those can be enjoyed by everyone in the family together!
Have you guys ever tasted woodruff before? (or in german Waldmeister) If not you have to try it its a unique taste that i never found somewhere else.\nI also would like to see you come up with a recipe for it.
I'm sorry but you know Mary Berry would say that the roll is not tight enough!!
Huh that's how I roll my joints 🤔
Mike, you can totally be Jeremy’s girlfriend if you want to. You can be anything you want if you believe hard enough.
Keep up the dairy free desserts/ food! 👌
What? didn't understand girlfriend explanation >.<
I love the intro it's so funny
Is it possible to substitute hazelnut with macadamia?
Please temper your hazelnut coffee mixture or you will scramble the yolk
What if you can't find hazelnut milk? Will other nut mills work??
u're knocking off my nuts\n\nthat sounded damn wrong man XD
You're knocking off my nuts\n\nMike, 2017
Dairy free recipe but you used eggs......
Mike just wanted to put his nuts all over that roll but Ben kept getting in the way
But I’m a girl and I can’t eat dairy
Wait it says coffee st the start and hazelnut in the title
“let me guess, someone stole your sweet roll”
Love the video, but I'm allergic to hazelnuts :(
Very nice, thanks for sharing!
i must try this, thank you.
Hey Mike, you are acting a little strange lately, are you alright?\nBlink twice on the next video if you need help!
Ben almost said Dairy Free Girlfriend at the end don't even try and hide it lad
You can make this vegan by replacing the egg yolks in the cream with silken tofu and the eggs in the cake with aqua faba for the volume and oil for the fat!
Mike''s looking better than eva... so YUMMAYY :)
Ben wins for the first minute with that nose pinch over the glasses...
You're knocking off my nuts \n-Micheal
Could I replace the coffee with something else? Dairy free but I can't stand the taste of coffee..
If he waited until cake was cooled off a little I don't think it would've stuck to the parchment. Can't always cover bad bits with powdered sugar
Oh my god, that looks soo good... I wanna have it!
oh my god Mike don't ignore it >:C
Looking for Jermi in the commnets ;)
That looks yummy even for people who can eat dairy.
I've already become obese watching this. Eating it will kill me for sure.
Swiss rolls are awesome and super tasty so it's awesome that you made a video with this recipe, but you can tell that it's def not perfect. Swiss rolls should be round and the spiral should stand out well otherwise the cake part might not have been made right which is totes fine for just eating with family, but you want to impress your mates right? ;)
Wow it is on trending!
aw man i *just* used the hazelnut milk i had sitting around to make a faux alfredo to get rid of it.
Beans brushing up against nuts. SAUCY
Looking good, Mike! Lots of jaw line definition!
Which is the better method for making marshmallows using egg whites or without egg whites?
I understand how weird this is going to sound, but I'm gonna say it anyway.\nWatching Ben roll that pastry was like, oddly sexual? Just me? 🤷
Looks a bit like it's filled with cold pork gravy... So my challenge for you is this: Make a savory pork swiss roll with gravy!
No No NO NO NO NO

We are eternal spiritual beings having a very brief earthly experience.   R.I.P and annihilation are a LIE!! Dont wait until you breathe your last to find this out.  \nhttps://youtu.be/5QqMQNPy2LU\nhttps://youtu.be/p70oyjbKftQ
REPENT AND ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR!!! Jesus died for you knowing that you may never love him back. He shed his blood and sacrificied his life so we can be in heaven with him and the Lord! Turn away from your wicked ways and accept Jesus Christ as your SAVIOR!!! HE IS COMING AND YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE LEFT BEHIND OR GO TO HELL. WOE ONTO YOU!!
*instructions unclear, got penis stuck in swiss roll*
Eggs are dairy...
Wowzer.. so trendy.. \n\n..\n\n-_-
I thought eggs were dairy... 🤔
Can we see jonye does my Halloween makeup?? 😏
I am going to try to recreate this look! I love that it's still really pretty and girly! I'm going to use rhinestones for teeth though! 😁 Great tutorial girl 💕
so pretty!!! xo from my channel to your’s <3
Dayummmmm
This is sooooo pretty
So cool:)
OK I just tried doing this and it came out that I was a donkey? Yea I'm not good at doing makeup
I’m gonna have to do something similar to this! I got a glow in the dark skeleton t shirt to take the boy trick or treating
You're the best :) skull <3\n\nIG my_insta_soul  :) come in <3
Katy I love youuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Lowkey, when I saw the cover I thought it was Sandra Bullock and I almost cried bc I love Sandra Bullock more than life.
Do any of you ladies know when the restock of the DesixKaty collection is ??😭😭
I love how people talk shit and then say “no shade”. Excuse me but you’re just being a bitch NO SHADE gtfo
How You Make A Skull Look Sexy & Colorful 😩🔥🔥🔥
You need to start a face chart series where you do a series of a bunch of face charts you like ❤️❤️😭😭😍😍 love you girl
The coverfx drops don' t play well with any makeup underneath.
Katy your skin looks extra bomb!! Did you add something new to your skincare routine?? Love you btw and love this look! ❤️❤️
Katy have you ever had that mole on the left side of your chest checked out? asking bc u my girl
Great work! Funny how you look like you have a permanent frown 😅
your lips make me want to eat powdered donuts 🤔
😍😍😍😍😍😍
❤️💖
U look like Kim K with that blonde hair! 😳 Love this Katy!!! 😍😍😍
I love when you do colorful and creative looks! They just look sooo bomb on you. 🙌🏽💕💜Like your face charts omg I dieeee, keep it coming @Katy! 💗💖
What you said was holo was NOT holo smfh
Ok I love this n all, but is it weird that I like you and Desi's hands? Like weirdest comment ever js tho🤣🤣 like the hands have posture haha
i don't get the dots on you forehead?
Can you do a fortune teller Halloween look
What other holosexuals got trigger when she said holo when there’s no holo on her look?
I'd like to skull fuck this girl.
I thought to myself I can do this, lets check the video out.  After watching a bit,  I would definitely never ever be able to do this. Very cool!
You look like Kim Kardashian in the thumbnail.
I love it, but I really love the eyes. I'm going to wear the eyes as an everyday look lol
You should have done your neck as well! 😊
How is this video advertiser friendly? I thought your immense beauty would trigger some kind of a red flag.💕
How do you look look gorgeous with every hair colour 💁🏻❤️
This is how you do a pretty skull look for Halloween without appropriating another culture.  Love it!
So dope K A T Y 💜💕
Girrrrrrl how is this even easy, it would take me a thousand hours and would come nowhere near as good as yours lol.
you look like Kim K with the wig on.
Am I the only one that think she looks like Kim kardashian???
Dam! I feel so inspired now! Thanks Katy!
Love it purple is my fav!! 💜
Can't wait to recreate this 😘😘😘
E n te R
😱😨👌✌️👏

Snow bunny 😳🐇🍆💦\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust playing
I lovee😍
Mmmmmm. I’d love to nibble your rosebud
😍😍
No bloopers?
love this!!
Now u look like a skeleton hoe, gj.
Yello
wow...this is cute and scary
Where are the blooper Katy? WHERE ARE THE BLOOPERS
loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I think this look would have looked a bit better if the contour section were a bit more anatomically correct.  You put too much of the pink on your cheecks when it should have been lighter in the front and darker(more pink) towards the hollows. Overall you did a great job Katy. Practice makes perfect.
I love the eye makeup so fucking much
Barbie 💕💜💕💀 I love this
GIRL!!...IF YOU DONT BRING BACK THE MALFOY HAIR!!!😤
Living, breathing, dying for this look yassss
Damn Katy this look is everything love it alot❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Any small YouTubers wanna support each other 💕💕let me know 👇🏼👇🏼
lol that intro beat chrisspy's intro real quick (lol chrisspy still love u boo)
Katy!! You're the cutest!! I absolutely love this look 💀
You're the spookiest pineapple in the pumpkin patch 😂🎃🍍
Loved this show I much !❤️ made it look soo simple
You had some real kabroncentation goin on w that kabrow gurl, no shade just sayin 👀
cuteeee 🌈 i wish you made this more detailed tho 😞but i guess you wanted this for your beginner viewers, excited for your other looks  🤙🏻
Currently in the ER slowly dying, I want my skeleton to look like this so I had to watch 🤷🏻‍♀️😂
This looks very similar to Sylvia gani's glitter glam skull just with little to no glitter in this video
i love it! i would love it more if your base is black or white.
You look like Kim Kardashian in the thumbnail.
I love your Halloween looks keep them coming.👌🏼👌🏼😘
i love your blonde hair!!! but i love you with brown hair too. I just love you. youre so gorgeous
I thaught it was desi’s video until i heard your voice hahaha
See this is why I love your videos. You get straight to the point!
It's hilarious that putting a skull and brow lines on your face makes you look exactly like KIM K
Any small YouTubers wanna support eachother?? 💜 let me know 👇👇👇👇
Looks like those shadows blend amazing
Loved it Katy 😉😙
I LOVE YOU 😭😭😭
QUEEEEEEEEEN
GOD BLESS
My favorite.
I love blonde @katy
Yaas for Halloween tuts!

*Camila's crew seem like such fun people and I'm so glad she is having such a fun time on tour. She is such a talented and* *amazing artist and I can't wait for her album. We covered her new song Havana on my channel, hope you will watch it.*
She deserves the world
It's so much better when ur alone
Best 2:22 minutes of my life
it needs to be a little longer....though thank you so so much camila for inspiring all the dreamers ...you are a true idol and inspiration... i love you so so so much.... i wanna meet you so badly... ilysm... my heart belongs to you and i swear it always beat million times faster whenever i hear your voice.. 😘😘😍😍💜💞🌹🙌🙌🙏🙏
Ok so I remember all these things when her crew was postin these vidson insta story on summer 2017 if you remember
Human Camila is enough for me ❤️❤️❤️
I'm breakin' down\nGonna start from scratch\nShake it off like an etch-a-sketch\nMy lips are saying goodbye\nMy eyes are finally dry\n\nGood old days😀😀\n\nI really miss the immature, really energetic, and really cute who loves ribbons Camilla 😂😂😂😂
JUST DO A FUCKING DOCUMENTARY, WE NEED MORE OF THIS
The dancer Justin is hot 🔥💕
did no one else see the tr*mp tower at :20 cause that shit doesn't belong here
So much fun !  They can be all friends but there is always a limit! She is their boss and they have to respect her as a boss and not as a friend... many singers go through the same stage of life that she is going... although she is having fun and she seems to be pretty cool
This reminds me of high school musical
I love her so much😧😭❤
omg this was in Atlanta. I've been to both of the places she went to, they were fun asf
She’s so down to earth and keeps it real
The happiness I felt watching this
I love her voice I love her songs !!!! She's perfect !!!!!!!!!!😍😍😍
i love you camila\nso much
I wish these videos would be longer
Every time this Havana starts in her documentary I go so emotional
I LOVE U AND I HAVE UR BACK ❤
I love this please do more camila
So thanks full to god. Thank you so much to make this angel real, she's talented,  pure, amazing, beautiful, she's a true artist because she feels what she sing every time. I love you Camila ♡
I feel like this Toshi guy and Camila might... I dont know maybe  PR??
Who tf dare to dislike this vid?!
Man vids so short but u still get so much emotion out of it 😫💕
I love how the vids are SHORT AND EXCITING!!! 😍😍
this girl really never fails to inspire me so much. first, to just reach for your dreams no matter what happens; that it is scary but you just have to do it scared. now, to never forget to live because one day you'll look back at life and it's not the riches, fame, your occupation or your degree that will matter but the memories & relationships you created. im emo. i love her. 😭
I miss her relationship with the girls of fifth harmony
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH 💜 🙈 , PERU PRESENTE Y APOYANDOTE 🌹 🙆❤❤
I felt like in a Grey's Anatomy episode lol
I love you Camz you make my life so worth living and girl I can't wait for the Havana video
i Need like at least 18315668713625868148634547164855553546761482484 Part\n*Rihanna's voice* COZ I CAN'T GET ENOUGH
I love the fact that she has such a strong bond to her family
She is look like teenager

Sofia is starting to look like Camila 😭😭 I’m prying so much
I clicked cause the hoes in the thumbnail are sexy af... Oops...
why are these so short 😩
Please read this comment! The state of California has essentially legalized INTENTIONALLY infecting others with HIV via SB 239. I have created a White House Petition to call on congress to publically address SB 239 and call for its repeal! I have FaceBook group called Repeal Sb-239. If you could talk about SB-239 and address this issue and call for people to sign the petition it would be a great help. I am paying to promote a vid on my channel that talks about this because it sets a dangerous precedence! Please help! I need 100,000 signatures within 30 days. We could do something good!
The Best feeling in the world is see you happy babe i Love u
she seems to be so happy on this new era. I love it
i just love you

Yummy 😋😋😋 Kisses from my channel 💕😘😘😘💕
Yogurt is gross
Hello Jemma, could you please make Raffaello cupcakes? :) x
I'm sorry I love Jemma but who bites and chews and ice lolly
mmm yummy! thanks for sharing the recipe, jemma! ♡
#YUM
Jemma you have nice hair
my mouth watering
First
Look really good....
soo nice!!!!
Can you do this with coconut?
Please made a biscoff cake:) They looks so good.
I'm glad u made this,in Florida it's still in the mid 80 degrees outside and I really need something to cool down!
Thank you Jemma!!! ❤️❤️❤️ it's always summer in Singapore here 😂 so thank you for this recipe
Heyy I really love watching you \nCan you show us how to make hot cookie dough pleaseee\nThanks x
Please show us how to make the cookies and cream oreo cake!
Yuuuuummmmmmmmmyyyyyyyy
Do these not cristallize? Every time I try freezing yogurt, it always creates small ice crystals that make it horrible to eat. How do I avoid that?
I love your shirt! It looks like vanilla cream or pudding with the seeds scattered throughout!
I love your videos. Even though summer is over it's still a good idea to make those. I have a nephew who is a year old and he is currently teething. He is in allot of pain and cold things such as ice lollies helps to sooth his gums and mouth. I might have to try your recipes for my nephew.
RIP blueberry at 0:30
Where can you get those icecream molds. Gotta have them.
Thanks for the recipe. Love you jemma.I live in Thailand l like watching you make a lot of sweets.
Those look delish!  And, you really did only use 4 ingredients!  Nice job Jemma!!
Will you be attempting chocolate macarons at some point? (Not macaroons) they are tricky to get right but I think you will get there. You could even do them as part of a cupcake or something. Like the oreo cupcakes but with chocolate macarons. Anyway, keep up the good work. The snickers brownie and Portuguese custard tarts videos are my favourites.
Yes for me it's sunny, i am living in Caribbean !!! And cold what does it mean ?? 😄, i try your loly pop tomorrow , thank you, i send you peace of SUN 🌞🌞🌞
This should not be trending
Yogurt.\nyogurt.\n_yogurt_\n*yogurt*\n\nsorry,you yog *hurt* my feelings with that spelling.
Made me cringe watching you BITE the popsicle... Besides that, thank you, I'm going to try and make this!!
thank you so much! I'm just trying to eat quite a bit healthier here in Hawaii, so it was nice to see this recipe to know that I don't necessarily have to give up a monthly dessert. Thanks again very excited to try this!
yup! it is always summer here in Singapore!
Does anyone know what the US conversions are??? TIA
How about some more/ new Halloween recipes? Are you going to have a Halloween skit this year?
Nice video I'll make those when I  have a party or friends gathering
OMG 😙😙Jemma you did amazing with the popsicle and with every dessert💓💯 I can not wait to be like you and meet you someday you 😍inspire me to do what I do best and that is to bake🎂🍦🍩
Omg these look AMAZING!! Also I really like the look of your kitchen Jemma! I have just started a baking channel myself and would love it if anyone could check it out and say hello😌
yummm and its so hot here in south america :p
Roseburg Oregon was 45 degrees this morning it's only about 51 degrees now I'm not happy with the cold weather already LOL I miss summer went warmer fall weather
What's your star sign
Thank you for this Jemma. We're heading into Summer in South Africa so I will definitely be making this!
We’re stuck in Eternal summer here ://

Love this video xxx
Hello sweetie.  I love all your videos, and I don't comment usually because I can't eat most of what you make because I don't like the flavor of butter or sugar.  I know, I'm really weird.  Anyway, thank you for this recipe because I would have never thought to make these!
Made your Oreo cupcakes for a bake sale today :) they were delicious (if I do say so myself) but all down to the perfect recipe!
I noticed the bird tattoo and the one on the towel @ 00:35. Then i realized that it was a cupcake jemma towel. Plz tell us more
No way you did that blueberry squishing in that gorgeous top and didn't get it covered in blueberry splatter...
Looks like lightly used tampons to me. Just saying.
What's the machine behind her?

The night before the premiere I was rewatching RIVERDALE and a black kitten showed up and her tail was cut off😱and loves me which is odd because they usually like my mom and she also LOVES RIVERDALE as soon as she heard it she was quiet as a mouse and she loves Cole she started rubbing the iPad when she hears his voice \nSo in honour of RIVERDALE and named her River \nBut she likes everyone on the show but she tilts her head whenever she hears Casey
It would be so great if you did a video with Casey !!!
I'm vegan too and I would love to see a video with your favorite easy and quick vegan recipes or your favorite vegan food places! ❤️❤️❤️

S2. E1. MIND BLOWN!
I'm getting a Shakira vibe 😂
She is the definition of music
a surprising amount of negativity in these comments :0 I was thrilled by this music video, the dancing and visuals are awesome and the music is great.
GASP, I can see Lindsey's shoulders! Jk I don't care ;P. I always think how could she possibly get any better... Then she does and it blows me away! Loved this sooooo much!
The Indian inspiration though ♥️
The magic Lindsey creates is truly a sight to behold.
I havent listen to the song and i already like and fav the video
First 14 seconds got me up in my feelz
Me: (Sees a new Lindsey Stirling video) I click.
I love this video, you are really good
MAKE A VIDEO FOR THE PHOENIX
This is beautifully done!
Lindsey Stirling you are awesome and I think you should do a cover of something just like this by Coldplay
Amazing! Good luck on Dancing With the Stars!
I just want a the phoenix music video :(
Wow, I've been a fan for a while, but this is like seeing Lindsey all grown up. Very polished, very artistic. Love it.
The video is amazing, but I can imagine bloopers where one of the background dancers hits someone in the face with one of the giant fans. Just me?
This was published on my bday. Thank you, Lindsey, for making my bday even awesome this year!!
Love the Indian style 🇮🇳❤️
_C H I L L S_ 😍
Please do shindler's list theme!!!
lindsey you should do a colab with the 'americas got talent' duo 'nuttin but stringz'...??
I LLLLOOOOOVVVVVEEEEEE your music your my fav youtuber 🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶🎶🎵🎶🎶 ps this is not jodi I'm her son I want to be able to play as good as you maybe even better someday
AMAZING, LINDSEY ❤️❤️ YOU'RE THE BEST
You always made my day ❤️
Really liked the video, but why put these annoying black bars? Why not record it in 16/9 aspect ratio?
Another amazing piece as always, venturing into new styles and genres fantastic can't wait to see what's next. Just beautiful loved it. Just beautiful movement
*I love the beginning!*
Everyone says the music is beautiful. I think she looks beautiful! Lindsey has talent and beauty! <3
I was kinda iffy on this one but when I watch it the second time I enjoyed so much more. If you do see this could you do a League of legends one, you could pick any champions music...I personally prefer Sonas but if you can't that's all right. Keep up the good work! Love the new winter cover and music something fresh with Christmas music instead of the same old same old.
Lindsey! I'm going to your concert on dec.11!!!
I love that she used a different style
We love it so much:)))
how's possible that 1k people dislike this song?!?!  This song is amazing!!!
Hi Lindsey, I love your music, and one of my other fav channels just made a really funny video about you!  Don't worry nothing mean about you is in it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_2742807005&feature=iv&index=3&list=PLGVpxD1HlmJ89Kmt-ZRih478uaXaOFKu7&src_vid=WmdjSWGfK9U&v=9omhrI0Pnq8
Goddess of the violin
This actually reminded me of Aladdin somehow from Disney and a mix of goddesses. Great music video Lindsey
When she was covered in gold she reminded me of Jadis, the ice witch from Narnia
Hi Lindsey! I have been listening to your music since.....well I guess Freshman Year if High School I believe. Well Anyway, I've listened to most of your videos and I must admit you have evolved so much in your art, the dancing , costumes, the meaning of each video you show the world, everything I've been hearing lately is so amazing I cant express how much I love it! Don't listen to what others are saying on these comments about you being a 'sell out', they dont see good talent like they used to these days dont they? Me personally havent seen any of what they claim to be true, all I see is a musician doing her art with all the love and confidence very few can match! I wish you the best of luck on Dancing with the Stars and hope you win!
And Devin Graham used to hit that... Jealous
I love you music!
Loved your video I think the last of us theme would be a good zombie apocalyptic video
may stop playing with your fingers plz?
I like those scales!\n\nI am your fan!
Would love to here her do a version of Shinsuke Nakamura’s theme
Hi lidsey, you music is great. See you in my dreams. ;) haha kises.
Pls make ur own Version of You say run from My Hero Academia :)!!!
Who doesn't love the skeleton violin(the one that she uses when she painted in gold) that she has.
To think, Roundtable Rival was my favourite...
Can u do the song closer??
Beautiful girl, beautiful music, treat for soul and eyes. Greetings from Poland
Didn't expect the Indian music mix! Loved it. Amazing 💐💐
I love Lindsay but this was a bit cringey for me...love the song but the dancing and the facials and the lip syncing...it could have been so much more beautifully done and in a more authentic way :(  this is coming from a belly dancer....
Less than a 100,000 to 10 Million Subscribers
oh boy i would like to smash them'all
I so love it ...tottaly awsome !!!!!
What Happens When A Black Belt Pretends To Be A White Belt\nhttp://ceesty.com/q9RAcc

There are just some music videos you have to watch the Music too. Among them is every music video by Lindsey Serling!

Awesome job, Lindsey!  absolutely love it :)
My favorite part 2:52 - 3:04
FANTASTIC

Amei 😍😍
Her dancing got better
Freaking awesome!!!! You never cease to amaze me
Goosebumps 😍
baka dinga tonga dinga dong
Amazing 😍
nice song
At the end!
You never cease to amaze.
Epic cinematic track for inspirational videos, time-lapses, movie trailers, teasers, intro, gaming videos, slideshows.
Mah idol <3
Schade dass sie nur noch zu posieren scheint. Sie kommt gar nicht mehr so natürlich rüber wie früher. Echt Schade Lindsey....
WOW. Great work ! Costumes are amazing ♡
Woooow
HOT
😍😍😍😍
Hello from Russia
Love You xoxo
AWESOME! :D
I love it!!!!😍
Like
I loved your out fit, the black one in the cage the most. Where your head has a white line across. THAT OUTFIT WAS PRETTEH
This was one of the only songs on Brave Enough that I really enjoyed, along with Gavi's Song and We Do We Go?. I think there's a lot of interesting things Lindsey could do with different tempos and moods that she doesn't. Most of her music ends up sounding the same, regardless of what album it's from.
im dont understand this) some one have russian subtitiles?))
I love this song and this is a amazing music video also is that Lindsey actually singing or making those sounds in the song
you losin weight
i listened the audio for million times but I never thought it was Lindsey singing.....
This dude is  unbelievable.
this is literally just a sonic fusion of age of adz and carrie and lowell lol
Carrie & Lowell Part 2: Electric Boogaloo
Wallowa Lake Monster debuted at #8 on the New Alternative 40 Chart this week:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwo_Ucs-wc4&list=PLxlSBzMcrtkMCVtuXEIz5BXpPfycTwsS5&index=8
Subaru Sedans is at it again.\ni can bet he is not using *A U T H E N T I C VIEWS D O T C O M* to get views \nas he is talented
a 10 minute edit of the outro \npls
The lyrics of this song make me think of a family losing their mother to alcoholism. Additionally, it is sung very beautifully.
I NEED A MYSTERY OF LOVE!!!!
Stunned by the beauty of this song
Spathiphyllum, cedar waxwing, and charybdis all in one song about a mother. This may be my favorite of Carrie and Lowell. \nHear me, my chiefs. I am tired. My heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more, forever.\n-Chief Joseph of the Wallowa
fuck you this is depressing as fuck
Oh! Miss Sufjan, you shouldn't have!
the beginning is like a softer version of weird fishes
There are sad days, and there are days Suf releases new music. These days are also sad, but in a good way. Thank you, Sadjan Stevens.
My heart is about to break again
is he gonna release more music soon?
More of Carrie and Lowell is always welcome
Between God and mortals, there is Sufjan Stevens. Pure magic.
This song is intrinsic af! But you can't tell me he didn't pull from his Should've Known Better progression on the first phrasings of the first verse
Subaru Stevens back on his shit
I was just at Wallowa Lake last weekend! Beautiful place.
Woah... Haven't gotten these Age of Adz vibes in a long time... But seamlessly blended with with Carrie and Lowell magic.
more proof that carrie & lowell could've been his oregon album
The 3-minute outro is bringing me to fucking tears. Greatest artist alive, without a doubt.
this album is gonna be the gayest ever i can feel it
Yo this is depressing as shit.
omg this was exactly what I needed, bless u Sufjan
what a beautiful slow drift of an ending
This is what genius sounds like.
First 10 seconds sound a lot like Everybody Wants To Rule The World
Heard this yesterday, for the first time. Thanks Gorilla vs. Bear! So beautiful!
Sounds like something exactly between C&L and Planetarium. Bless him.
the second half straight up beat me up, this is so good
I don't know how he managed to make me cry with all his songs.
Holy shit this is beautiful, can't wait!!!
I never clicked a video so fast and I was not disappointed
i thought it was mystery of love...this is better
This guy is a genius
is this a nylon banjo?
monsters showing their face = 2017
It's hard to believe that I've loved Sufjan for 12 years now.
Thank you thank you so much for releasing it on my birthday ❤
2:13 I melt
Boy, another goosebumps attack, just like the first time I heard the entire Carrie & Lowell album :')
Man I used to swim in wallowa lake all the time as a kid.
Been a fan since time began. Keep inspiring creative genius!
This is so beautifull. Thank you, thank you !
just heard this today on the radio tripped me out hard core
Gawd I love him
The beauty of this song makes up for my disappointment that the new release is not Mystery of Love
Had a crappy day. This made it better
*this is wine to my ears - both bitter and sweet at the same time*
Thank you, yet again Sufjan, for saving my life
Sufjan I would do anything for you
Surfism Stovens is the musician of the century.
1:54 AAAAAAAHHHHHH I LOVE YOU SUBARU
Sufjan Stevens is online
cara eu te amo demais
Amazing!! So inspiring Suf!!!!

I fucking love you Sufjan❤❤
Exquisite Sufjan. I love you.
Our boy got #20 on trending! 💪
thank you suf
The Greatest Gift is Sufjan Stevens himself. An angel in our midst, singing to God for all of us.
this song is like half carrie and lowell, half age of adz
this is where sufjan is at his best ... stripped back, folk-y, vulnerable. love it.
Dearest heart, you feel it rising do you not? How we love you and want you to know of our gratitude, simply for YOU Sufjan, Lowell and all in the family that is life. As an aside this notification came through while I am covered in hospital sheets. Too many hospital stays simply trying to keep death (life?) at bay... this is a gift I take with me on day 3. You lulled me to sleep last night with Carrie and Lowell and Planetarium on repeat. I am no longer afraid. I merely want release... we're all going to die. Look right into the light lovelies. It Wont.Hurt.A.Bit... Has your prayer only been LOVE? GOOD. For love is all...
not much moved me to tears but blue bucket of gold live.  until this... and now it all makes me cry.  in a good way\n...I think.  well it's beautiful isn't it.
Sufjan, it's hard to tell if you're a better poet or a musician. Absolutely incomparable genius
Sufjan Stevens is my favorite musician because he is artsy
In 1885, a prospector, who wished to keep his identity a secret, was about midway across the lake when he saw an animal about fifty yards to the right of his boat. The animal reared its head and neck out of the water about 10 feet, paused, then quickly dove back into the water.
You are the Bob Dylan of our generation.
18 days left.
noooo i thought this was a new album
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS GARBAGE?????
DO HEEBIEJIEBEES (or however u spell that) NEXT PLS I RLLY LOVE YOUR ALBUM
This song is really good for u!lol😂
that little bit at the end is 🔥🔥
this is so bad.
Odd future should get back together but have amine with them or just like Tyler and amine it would be 🔥
What's the song at the end?
Nice video , it's power ⚡
I feel terrible for the intern that had to put together that sticky note scene

o n e h i t w o n d e r
Wtf in the being a girl that looks like him LMAO
I clicked like as soon as the camera panned out and his face was on the girl
How bout the real lick is at the end of the song. I like that song
Huh.  His bike is the blue toilet in the next scene.  Guess there's no reason to waste money on additional props when you've got all you need.
He's not a one hit wonder I knew it
Aminé needs to make a son with Tyler, The Creator
is it just me or does it seem like he took the blackbear - i miss the old u flow?? like at he start of the song seems the same
i want him to be more popular!
He definitely want's some British pussy with these references lol.
It was only right the Mel B was in this video. I was expecting her to show up the whole time seeing that the title of this song is called Spice Girl. Also Issa looked very sexy in that head wrap. I don't know why, but that was doing it for me.
YOU GOT A FUCKING SPICE GIRL HOLY SHIT
stfu was a good ass song but he should've named it something more original like 5 songs named stfu came out this year already.
this that *bouta call my friends, get cute, and go to the club* song
This dude look like playboy carti .... oh wait THEY ARE COUSINS
He tired of people sayin he a 1 hit wonder 😂
you smoke too much pot these videos wack af
Did good for u get gold or sum because it should be like double platinum ppl need to really listen to him
you need to do a complete song with the end too!!! this beat is too good!!!! 45sec isint enough!!!! :)
Good song I like that last part
Was the part at the end part of this song? If not can someone tell me the name of the song
whats the song at the end called
What’s the ending?
whats the name of the song at the end?
This is my favorite music video ever.
seems like hes into guys lol guys are laying on him n around him even the girls have man faces pasted on to theres lmfao
How come all the freshmen and new rappers go to cole bennet and not make nice music videos like amine does
Your a one hit wonder
1:33 why is this bitch me in science class
iN neW YoRK i mILLy rocK
I was always wondering why Mel.B was there randomly but then I remembered, \nSHE WAS IN SPICE GIRLS. 😂
Can someone link the outro
*Search up Sniper J Era on YouTube.* He's an Indian kid who's spits straight bars. I promise that you won't regret it.
Anyone else pick up on the gnarly flute solo?
Eh ur still a one get wonder😂😂
What’s up with Amine and bananas?
whats the name of the song at the end??
I wonder if he has a tick where he looks up because like he does it a lot
Like you listened to the song before the video
Amine is my new favorite rapper. Good for u was fye
The flute is back.
Never seen the other STFU video before & not interested.
What the is that???
Tyler the creator inspired this nigga
I wonder if the channel music will hit 100 million subs
This song makes me wanna subscribe to Jake Paul
The ending is the most dope
I REALLY WANT A SPICE ZIGGY ZIGGY AFRICA MY WHOLE WORLD..SCARY AND SPORTY😂😂😂
Cute ass dog @2:43
Issa!
Issa banger
I love this nigga bruh

whats the song at the end when the credits are rolling
Thanks, that was really insightful - could you also cover the other formats and what their purpose is? MP3/ACC/OGG
Interesting video. Snobbish audiophiles remind of people who claim to know good wine. I wonder how well they'd be able to identify wines if we switched labels and price tags, etc.
I think its all about the mood created, example: I don't like Jazz or Trumpet players,.. BUT!!! every time I listen to a MILES DAVIS recording,... I get blown away,... something he was able to do with music (tones, frequency's, timing, meters, dissonance, silence, quiet sounds, loud sounds,... ect.) is just mind blowing to me.
There's always going to be a difference between an mp3 and a .wav. To say otherwise would be to lie to yourself. You can't fool nature's law. \n\nHowever, as to which one sounds better is all in the ear of the beholder. I personally like the YouTube version of Meshuggah's Rational Gaze better than right off the album.\n\nSue me.
I dont believe many people could tell the difference between 44.1k and 96k after mastering but definately MP3 especially on a large system with big subwoofers and extended highs. I have found most headphones arent the same in this sense for some reason.
All I know is this: there is something where I hear the instruments very clearly defined, not a one lump of sounds, and in digital world this mostly happens when I listen to 24/96 music.
So true story. But on the compression artefacts on mp3, doesn't that require a different skillset when to isolate those when listening? I once listened to an indept analysis of compressed files on a loudnessconvention of EBU by thomas Lund. He inverted a compressed track and combined it with the original one. What remained was the difference between the two. It was a pretty grusome distortion, which would lead to listening fatigue. i know from own experience that 128 kb files suffer in the high regions, especially when pushed to loud. Ofcourse encoding quality has an effect. Your opinion please?
So I know this bass player who always turns his volume up crazy high at gigs. I think it’s because of his hearing. He’s in his 50s and the rest of the band are in their 20s and 30s. Is that possible or is he just a show boater?
I’m sorry but what a bunch of pseudo science crap. Just a computer soundcard + (cheap?) headphones. Try it in real life with a decent DAC and amp and good set of speakers in a nice room, then what do you hear? If you only use your smartphone and earplugs and Spotify, sure you won’t notice
The mp3 files are not noticeable when I hear electronic, pop, hip hop. But Rock, Classical, DnB, Jazz, or somethig with a huge orchestration I can hear diferences between quality.
I got 4 out of 6, didn't select the 128K mp3 at all. \n\nThe Coldplay sample was horrible, over produced, over excited, over compressed. 10 seconds was enough.
Offering it in a lossless format means people can choose to transcode to whatever format they want. For example 100kbit/s OPUS (try some ABX testing with that!).\n Transcoding MP3 to other lossy formats can lead to audible artifacts that wouldn't be there with the original source.
T you Rick is it possible that a lot of people can hear the diference?? YES!!!  Is it possible that a lot of people can't hear the diference?? YES!!! in some days my computer makes a background noise trough all the soundcard, and some days-hopeflly the majority-don't, some days i'm tired and some other i'm not, and yes it makes a difrence, have you heard placebo effects???? ...these to say Thank you Rick i've been learning a lot with you, and by now i've learned some things that search for perfection that is not on our reach., i'm producing in propellerheads reason/samson resolv and, as the time passed, is my knowledge that really makes the diference bcause when i bounce it outthere and play it wherever outside it sounds intirelly diferently from place to place, so audioFiles or audioFooles, cd or cassete recorder blá blá blá..., 50% 4 each other.. again Thank You very much Rick we all are intitled to our opinion and yes i've understood yours, better some days,  i'm the best and others just a fool you know???so let them speack wathever..
Jazz in mp3 format totally sucks. For that matter any digital format is inferior to vinyl for jazz. You listen to jazz on vinyl (with good headphones) that hasn't touched the digital realm at all, strictly analog, and you can hear the overtones on the bass, the saxophonist's fingers moving on the keys, the drummer's foot moving on the high hat stand. You are in the room with the band. \n\nI ripped all my CDs into iTunes as mp3s and noticed a digital distortion caused by the overtones in the ride cymbal. A hissing, crackling sound. You can hear it on a lot of jazz uploaded on YouTube. I went back and ripped my whole collection as Apple Lossless and the hiss is gone. Fuck mp3s.
I had an experience recently re-mastering an old analogue recording that featured a synthesised EMS Synthi style falling whistle, and it suddenly appeared in the most unmusical way. I had to view the audio spectrum to see that it started several bars earlier way up at 18kHz+ then get my 14 year old daughter to listen and tell me how that part was balanced. She reported that at a nominal listening volume the whistle was piercing for her at that frequency, and I was able to paint in a 6dB drop, which fixed it.\n\nAcuity of hearing doesn't simply relate to frequency, but to differentiation. Many older people (I'm 57 - is that old?) begin to lose the ability to pick one sound out from another, because of damage and wear to the cilia in the cochlea. That does affect which frequencies we can hear, because you lose cilia, but it can also affect the signals that are sent by the cochlea for processing in the brain if the microtubules in the cilia are affected by degradation caused by age or illness. \n\nLike Rick says, our brains are very good at compensating, but only up to a point. It becomes especially apparent when dealing with new sounds or combinations of sounds, and we can hear this in some recorded music. For example, Frank Zappa's later remixes of his early work were really very poor and have had to be remastered again. He was quite ill when those mixes were done, either by him overseeing them or actually hands on.\n\nTurns out I can only hear up to about 14kHz on a good day, but if I'm tired or my ears have been abused for a few hours by too much work, it can fall drastically.\n\nThe good news is that there are lots of spectral tools that can report on dB values at all the frequencies, and if you are dealing with known instruments and gear experience will go a long way. Also, there is very little in the post 10 kHz range that is not directly harmonically connected to the lower frequencies, so unless you are constantly pushing the higher frequencies it'll probably be OK.\n\nAge sucks, but technology saves.
Really liking this kind of content, Rick. Dispelling misconceptions gives me a real charge and fuels my musical endeavors more than all the reading about xyz products etc ever could.
In my own tests, mp3 at any bitrate has flaws in reproducing transients, especially in high frequencies. The treble sound becomes indistinct, hazy, the opposite of crisp.  I don't notice this on every track.  It depends on the material.  128k has fairly awful treble sound.  I noticed very little improvement from 192k to 256k, above that no difference at all. (320k is a waste).  So it's not just about frequency range, although it's true 128k is low-pass filtered at 16kHz, 160k at about 20kHz.\n\nI also tested AAC+, and this format is vastly better.  The ogg format is nearly as good.  Above about 120k AAC+ I cannot tell the difference from uncompressed WAV at all.  Crisp, clear treble transients.
but random guessing would've been 33.3% she got twice that and i got 100% bad video
I've been enjoying and learning from these videos for some time. Thank you, Rick--I should subscribe, but I'm afraid that I won't be able to keep up.  But a few points with respect to this one. \n\nThis seems to have become a wide ranging discussion as to the audio quality of MP3s.  \nThe first point I would make about this is that different is not the same as inferior.  There are a lot of audiophiles that prefer the sound of vinyl--they're not wrong about that--it's what they prefer.  (BTW--what's with all of this criticism of audiophiles?  I'm not one, but I have to note that they are maybe the most avid purchasers of music. What kind of business considers its best customers stupid?)\n\nI think what this test shows is that there's a difference in quality.  In every case, she was able to choose one as superior--she heard a difference.  I suspect a recording will in most cases sound best on the technology it was engineered for.  If it's 320bit, 320bit will sound best.  Criticizing and artists choice of medium is about the same as criticizing his/her melodic choices.\n\nHaving said that, I have no doubt that 128bit MP3s are objectively inferior, and I believe that their prevalence has dumbed down music consumers and the industry.  Harmonies and voicings are much simpler than in the 60s-80s and counterpoint has all but disappeared from pop music (see video why is modern pop music so terrible).  I am hopeful that higher bit rates will lead to better music.  I think that's the only way for this business to recover--Despite all of the great musicians active today (and there are a lot), kids today don't appreciate music the way we did.
Thankyou!!! I’ve been saying this to people for years myself.. \nto think of the money people waste
I am here only for the comments ;-).
Let me point out that the mp3 test she took is flawed for a number of reasons. \n\nFor example, listening to a sample for the second time *will* alter your memory of the previous one. We also filter things we already heard as soon as they repeat, with varying intensity depending on what it is. And, we tend to look for details in the wrong places when consciously comparing them sequentially (unfortunatelly it's almost impossible to compare sounds simultanously).\nNot to mention that memory gets altered slightly everytime we access it, so listening to a sample of a song we know has an impact on our response to it, especially the first time.\n\nI liked your video, but you presented a question about one subject and showed and argument for your opinion which is a little unrelated.\nPeople can have a better or worse experience due to slight differences in sound quality, and they might even not be able to pinpoint it, since sound is so subjective. So in my opinion, talking about audio file compression is a separate subject.\n\nBut on THAT subject, I think you focused too much on the high-frequencies compression, when I believe you actually know that mp3 does a lot more. Personally, what bothers me most is usually in the lower bands, or when the music is too busy and loud that the original limiting gets very distorted.\n\nJust my two cents.
I could easily tell the difference on my phone speaker, compression algorithms have very distinct sound signatures especially in the way they reproduce sibilance. you can look up an example of all the sound frequencies thats removed from an mp3 and use it to train your ears on what to look for in various compression systems.
From working/recording as a musician in well known studios in London, and speaking as an audiophile myself, I've learnt that its the 'guy/gal behind the desk' that makes or breaks the outcome of any recording. After speaking with many engineers about this topic over the years, the general consensus is that it is not the technology itself that defines the quality of the outcome, but the IMPLENTATION of the technology. I own a Linn/Naim/Epos system at home and it is what you could call a high resolution system. I own some '70s digital master vinyl recordings that sound simply sublime, '70s analogue vinyl that sounds awful, modern digital that sounds awful, modern analogue that sounds sublime plus everything in between. All of it comes down to the skill of the engineer. A badly placed mic will sound second rate no matter what it's plugged into - Garbage in, Garbage out as they say.\n\nHowever....\n\nThe quick A/B demos Michelle took part in don't really offer much help though. I used to work occasionally in a specialist HiFi store back in the '80s and a first generation 14bit CD player would 'wow' customers compared to a cultured vinyl front end due to its artificially bright, forward tonal balance. But like a TV with superficially bright, dazzling colours, it soon becomes fatiguing to experience. Long term listening is required for a better judgement. Its the sign of a poor system if you're reaching for the remote to flick tracks - a good system should be compelling to listen to, rather than 'impressive'.\n\nUltrasonic frequencies are known to resonate with audible frequencies which is often cited as one of the reasons for analogue having a more 'natural' sound than digital. Just because we cannot 'hear' above 22k, it doesn't necessarily mean we cannot 'hear' the effects of >22k on what we CAN hear <22k. At the other end of the spectrum, subsonic frequencies have been shown to affect mood for example. So I think in regard to data compression, it's risky to chuck out duplicated - (superfluous (?)) or inaudible frequencies with these data compression algorithms, as these frequencies affect our brains processing of what we hear in ways which we do not perhaps fully understand. How many harmonics are produced by that single violin note? No doubt many duplicated by the French horn and snare drum? Do they interact on an inaudible, but vital way?\n\nWe humans are very clever with our algorithms, but we can't shortcut or outwit nature. Our perception of music through hearing processes evolved over hundreds of thousands years is perhaps too complex to be quantified or fully understood, let alone managed by relatively primitive, juvenile technology. Personally I'm convinced we need as faithful a reproduction of all frequencies inside and outside the audible range no matter how many are duplicated simultaneously, as that is what would happen in a real world, live, acoustic environment with no electronic processing whatsoever, regardless of bit/sampling rate. No disrespect to Michelle or anyone else, but through a high resolution system - perhaps headphones in front of a computer screen is not ideal? - a data compressed version of a full resolution recording is, to my ears at least, clearly inferior, in ways that cannot be 'measured' eg. emotional communication. Does that compressed version of an Eddie Van Halen solo make you want to jump up and play air guitar? Or Gorecki's Symphony #3 make you cry? In my experience, no. These factors cannot be measured, but they are demostrably real, and surely the very escence ie. the whole point of music in the first place? Data compression works, but does it? No point in chucking the baby out with the bathwater.\n\nIts interesting that in studios I've worked in which have absolute state of the art equipment, when the production team and their musician friends are working on a pet music project for fun in their own time, with all that equipment at their disposal, they often dust off the old analogue 1/2 in the corner because there's just something about it.
Take a .wav and stack it with the phase inverted high quality .mp3 to render the audio track of only what IS cut out in the .mp3. Its a fun little demo and everyone should do it with their favorite piece of music. Depending on the song and style, it will be mostly transient energy and extra low bass reverb that is left. Sometimes funny bits of vocals come through, But you typically have to boost the levels a lot to really hear much at all. The problem is most streaming and internet audio comes across at 128 or maybe 256 and you can still hear those artifacts on metallic sounds. Ask yourself what is about 12-14Khz and it's mostly metals. This is because real metals produce such complex overtones. Wood instruments and most electronic instruments . . . it won't make much of a difference.
I listen to CDs 😕
Got 3 outta 6. The 3 i missed were in 320. Most of que wav tracks had some kind of liveliness to them that the others didn't. I noticed that especially when there were strings, spacious reverbs and sub bass sine waves
When i listen to music im familiar with i can clearly hear a distinction between 192 kbps and 320 kbps, when i listen for the difference between 320 kbps and 1140 kbps id like to think im hearing a difference, but not nearly as distinct as 192 vs 320, and this is with headphones, without the headphones and music that im highly familiar with it would probably be even tougher.
i only got 2/6 and chose the 320 kbps on the other 4.
this is good! thanks Tim Bell of Grace Music Academy
''...their ears and their experience give them the taste to know what sounds good''  Absobloodylutely spot on.
Check out the Absolute Sound for some chuckles. You can spend huge dollars for low-oxygen cables and even cable risers that keep your speaker runs off of the floor because that would muddy the sound(?!}. Actually, I think  in light of the current 'good enough'  state of the art (ex: cell phones and poor connections), a 192k mp3 is certainly good enough to get the message across while I'm listening on my earbuds on the train with lots of other noise going on. I even sometimes mix with just earbuds. This from a guy who owns Avalon, Tubetech, Fearn and other expensive gear but thats another story.  Cheers!
As an audio file I applaud your candid truthfulness and finally somebody has said exactly what I've been saying for years. Thank you.
I used to spend so much time researching the difference between WAVs and 320kb MP3's and I really, really wanted to be able to hear the difference. I soon accepted the fact I couldn't at all and that it didn't matter. Although I still prefer having WAV files to MP3s lol, I like to believe it's better quality to my ears I guess.
Burning down the BS!
I was so stoked at doing this test. Turns out it's the well known NPR test me and my son already did a while back :)
Classical composers tend to peak between 50 -70 also. Could also have to do with the maturity of hearing
Hey Rick, fan of the channel. However, would like to point out the following flaw with the test the lady did. I took the test myself a year ago. Consider this: is the setup used for the test capable to reproduce higher quality digital files with higher quality at analog end? If the dac makes a bad job of doing so then the test is by enlarge irrelevant. All components of the sound reproduction chain are important and the weakest bit is what you are hearing in the end.
I am not audiophile and neither a audio-fool, but this is not a fair test as I see it! First computer DAC are frequently terrible and headphone sets are as well BAD on average! So... I think that you need good equipment to take advantage of lossless files, I agree that 320Kb mp3 is fine for most of the people but also think that if you listen this test through a good equipment most of people will guess more than 50% for sure! Because you can't find low bass and high frequencies that you skin feels through average equipments... I can't listen anything behind 18800Khz but I can feel it I'm sure!
Do I need an uncompressed file when I'm recording, editing and producing audio? Absolutely. Do I need it during playback? Probably not. There are a few factors that come into play in this argument though. Certain types of music may be (however unlikely) more affected by data compression than others. If there are more complex overtones and tremendous dynamic range present in the audio track, there may be a greater chance for a perceptible difference. Messing with the dynamics? Possibility of artifacts? Perhaps. At 128 kbps, there is a clear perceptible degradation of fidelity but at 320 kbps, I think the chances are very slim, even in a proper listening environment (Yes. That means good quality loudspeakers in an acoustically treated room and not headphones). Maybe 1 out of a thousand tracks will be perceptibly affected but one thing is certain. The fear of quality loss is far greater than any actual loss when it comes to 320 kbps mp3. On the consumer end, pretty much no one (audiophiles included) will be able to tell the difference in a realistic listening scenario.
Great video
I got 3 out of 6 correct in the NPR test. Really 320 kbps and WAV file do sound similar. Listened on ATH M30.
I am hear all the difference clearly, but anyway i can't sing on the pitch. -_-
Watching her take that test gave me the idea that you could play all the tracks from your new album in random order, and try and have her match up the titles with the tracks and see how many she gets right.
Thanks, Rick. I did a similar test some years ago, and it cured me from being an audiofool. \n\nAnother cure for those who are still skeptical: buy two similar headphones (same type and price range) from different brands. For instance a Sennheiser (easy going type of sound) and ditto Beyerdynamic (somewhat brighter sounding). Listen to one pair of headphones exclusively for some time (at least a few hours, a bit longer for more dramatic effect). Now switch to the other pair. \n\nIf you started with the Sennheiser, the Beyerdynamic will sound way too bright. If you started with the Beyerdynamic, the Sennheiser will sound dull/boring. But if you keep listening for a while, your ears (actually your mind) will adapt. Both will sound fine after a few hours.      \n\nBottom line: you listen with your mind as much as with your ears. That's why mp3's work the way they do. Your mind focuses on what's important and ignores what's not. If you do research on what the average mind doesn't notice, you can leave it out, with some margin of error for the golden ears among us. 320 kbps has a fairly inclusive margin of error, if you ask me.
Thanks for this video !\nPerhaps this is meaning music is just emotion, not sound quality. And emotion is not money, high priced monitors, high frequencies, perfect studio conditions, etc.\nFor people old enough I'm sure we can all remember a piece of music we loved and that we were hearing on vinyl with cracks, noises, track jumps, or, even worst, on tape, perhaps recorded from a AM radio with frequency shifts, blips, ghost noises... And the emotion was higher than a perfect sounding other piece.\nMusic is emotion. And emotion is not money (or technical means). Emotion is more like love than maths.\nIn a lot of productions we even add distorsion, blips, and analog noises to bring back such emotion...\nSo just  listen to music with your heart, it is better at knowing if music is good or not than your ears !\nAnd when a poser will come to tell you with sophisticated arguments mp3 is ruining music, just give him the link to this excellent Rick video :-)
Hello Rick, I also got 4 out 6 jeje, no music degree here, mere luck probably jaja :), But I do have started collecting 24/96 flac files and a few DSD
Amen for posting this. I can't believe people argue against this obvious conclusion. Because they have failed in other parts of their life they want to believe they are somehow superior at more subjective things.
Hi Rick, what are your thoughts on MQA? I've just become aware of it and sounds exciting. Really love and appreciate your channel. Thanks, Jamey
The source content quality is key as is the monitoring devices being used. If the source material is not recorded, mixed or mastered well, the differences in many cases will be negligible when processed down to 320kbps or even lower. I have heard plenty of bad mixes that were dense and squashed to death played back at 44.1 that didn't sound any different when processed at varying bit rates all the way down to 128. The better the source content, the more noticeable the differences particularly with acoustic music with complex frequency content, ambient space and extensive dynamic range. I was a Spotify subscriber for quite a while and streamed at 320k until I switched to Tidal which offers uncompressed streaming. I also went back and played CD's in my collection and was shocked how much I had been conditioned to accept what I had been missing. Music I had listened to for years suddenly had more depth. I could hear more detail in reverb tails, more shimmer in the cymbal decays, and a deeper overall soundstage. I am 57 years old, and even with my well worn ears, I can clearly hear a difference dependent upon musical genre and quality of the original source content.
In the early 90s, I read of a study, in recording engineer magazine, as I recall. Maybe it was mix, or another fairly  technical periodical. Some Japanese researchers did an a/b test,of digital vs analogue recordings. Instead of asking subjects to identify what they were hearing they measured brainwave responses. After 2o minutes, neocortex hemispheres went into an entrainment ( usually one is dominant,and this switches back and forth cyclically) mode. Digita; source never stimulated this entrainment response. I have not found any follow up on this.
Have you ever listened to Jim O'rourke? Im really interested in his style of composing like in The Visitor and another album called Eurkea.
Hi Rick! Could you do an episode on how musicians/composers/engineers with hearing problems deal with (their) music. Both as a performer and a simple listner ?
I engineered a while some loudspeakers. The effect of your listening room and the reflections, absorbing and resonance is much more important than any samplingrate, the noise of your turntable or the kind of cable between amplifier and speaker.\nBut no digital format ever gets the spirit of a LP ever. \nBut I prefer to listen digital. Its better.
A lot of the myths came about in the early days of AD and DA converters.  There were dreadful artefacts added to early digital recordings because of very audible harmonics introduced by crude digital low pass filters that should have let 19K and below through but also added many overtones in the audible spectrum as a side effect.  You can hear them on some early digitally recorded Madonna and Michael Jackson records.  The early DA converters also had similar issues with poor sample clocks and filters, especially those used in early MP3 players.  All this badly implemented digital circuitry caused the myths of being able to 'hear' digital v analogue and CD vs high bit rate MP3.  Modern clocks, filters, converters and ultra high bandwidth DSP processors at a cost of pennies make these problems a thing of the past but unfortunately the myths have a truth from the past and stick with us.
How old is Michelle?
The amps, the speakers, and the player matter and much, even cables, it is not snobbery, it is Hi Fi against cheap and poor quality equipment, be sure. Not too much people can hear the diference between your 1173 Neve pre amps and lets say a cheap audio interface pre amp. but there is, and a lot. To me it is due that not too much people can listen to the Neve 1173 in action, same when they compare software vs hardware, there is a lot of diference but people like to said no there is not, come on...
Hi Rick! I think it is a similar issue to having a perfect pitch or not. When you have a very good hearing, you just do and you physically can’t enjoy mp3s. Also, my guess is that quite a lot of people hear the difference but without realising it. I often noticed while playing music to friends that if I play a CD, they still chat. When I play a high quality wav, they stop talking and start only listening. I don’t ask them to, of course! – it just happens. I think it can be common that people might not consciously notice the difference but it will affect their enjoyment and appreciation of music.\n\nI hear very high frequencies, over 20 K for sure, I think close to 25 K (I hear devices made to scare off animals, very loud, and they are supposed to produce a sound around 25 K – other people who were with me couldn’t hear them at all, I could hear them so loud they were extremely irritating). Humans don’t hear these frequencies as loud as the main frequencies in our hearing range but they are part of the sound world around us and part of recorded music. When music is converted into mp3 or mastered, something ugly happens to those high frequencies; I think the mastering makes them too loud and in the case of the mp3 I think they are replaced with something else, must be some lower frequencies, and THEN they really become noticeable, in a nasty way, especially while listening on headphones. It is like having your ears pierced with rusty needles, especially while listening to the (“good”) 320 kbps mp3s – 128 kbps sound poor and limited but at least they are not hurting me on the headphones. Also, something is missing, some kind of “breath” or “halo” or “haze” around the sound. I think that more people hear them (at least a little bit) than they realise, but they don’t pay attention – and after several hours of working with music, or being in a loud environment, of course your ears get tired and one might not notice such subtle things any more. This would explain why Michelle failed to identify the best quality file at the end of the test – her ears were already a little tired, and also – as she said she loved that song – she might have gone for the quality she was most used to, the mp3 - probably she had heard it in this format many times.\n\nI think it’s not just the age that has to do with how well you hear but how much noise you have been exposed to – the mixing engineers you mention have worked with sound for many years, many hours a day, probably often at high volumes, so it must have affected their hearing. I have a (musician) friend who is close to 50 and he can hear very high frequencies about as well as me – but he never listens to music loud and gives his ears a lot of rest. It is probably genetic, too, like a lot of things.\n\nI wouldn’t agree that the mixing engineer’s hearing in the high range doesn’t make a difference – yes, the skill is the most important, but when I worked with sound engineers who hear (a lot) less in the high range, they always made the high instrumental parts too loud, I had to ask them to correct it. I also noticed sound engineers who didn’t hear very well in the high range didn’t always notice when the sound was clipping, unless it was very loud and obvious, or didn’t notice other “pollution” on the recording when there was for example a problem with the grounding and it affected the recording. A mixing engineer who is aware of it can predict and correct a lot but it, maybe using those strategies you are talking about – ? – but it is not true it doesn’t matter how much you hear. But I think it is a bigger problem when a mastering engineer can’t hear the high frequencies because he will make horrible, “biting” masters, like a lot of modern mainstream pop.
I think it really depends on the quality of the playback speakers.  On crappy systems, or built in computer audio converters, you probably can't differentiate but on a true audiophile system I think you can.
But what if you're a bat or Daredevil?  LOL\nIt's not -audiophile- but *technophile*\nPeople have fallen in love tech not actual music.
Informative and fun  video.
I agree with Rick 1,000%.  The audiophile world is as full of snake oil as any area of human behavior that you can name. I have listened to the same music on LP, mp3 128k, 192k, 320k, wav file, flac and 24/192. tube gear vs high end solid state.\n320k is fine for most music, especially rock, pop and most jazz.  Each person's ears are so different. You just have to find the gear that pleases you and not worry about what so-called golden ear critics like. Most of the time their livelihood depends on foolish rich people way over-spending. Fine, god bless them. But you can get plenty good sound for very reasonable money, and you don't have to monkey around with flacs. btw, I think they use NS-10's just to replicate the sound of car speakers! Just one person's opinion.  Thanks for another great video, Rick!
sample size of one. 'nuff said.
I've only experience of Zoom H2n which has 16bit 44.1kHz, 24bit 48kHz and 24bit 96kHz and I can hear the difference on a single voice. I'm 67. It's not a massive difference but it's 'clarity'. Each step up just sounds a bit 'clearer' or slightly less muddy (relatively). It's the same with ribbon tweeters. I think it's the lessening of intermodulations in the frequency ranges I *can* hear. I don't think it will be so on all content but definitely sparse well recorded (hifi) mixes will benefit and some 'busy' mixes will sound less busy which could be counterproductive in some cases. OTOH if you honestly can't hear the difference there's no point in persuing higher rates. It's the same with UHD video. Some people can't see the difference between UHD/4K, 3K and Full HD. I can and I know when something in UHD/4K is 'soft' or not focussed to it's best. Some of the best 4k footage is actually 8K downrezzed and it's eye popping!
I've self-tested my hearing, and I'm at about 18k right now, give or take. I'm 22 and I've been working as a sound tech at what is now my alma mater. My mixer is usually set to 44.1 khz output. I hear no difference between 44.1 khz and 48 khz. Nor do I hear a difference between recordings I have in 24 bit/44.1 khz WAV and the same tracks in 320kb/s MP3. The files are of such high quality now that it doesn't matter if it's lossless mp3 or WAV.
I remember taking a similar hearing test some years ago. I remember being able to reliably discriminate between 128 and 320 kbps MP3s, although not without effort. I despise the pixelated sound you get with a poor sound quality, which sounds like a stream of blibs and blubs, which I heard a hint of in the 128 kbps samples. Given the fact that human hearing is not an LTI system, higher frequencies may be able to affect perceived sound in nontrivial ways.
Disagree....mostly, many things at play when one plays music, of course it depends on what equipment, compression, dymaic range , frequency response, the way it distorts, many new reissues on CD have destroyed the dynamic range of the original recording (mp3 loud culture effect?). i have multiple systems and the blind fold test is the by far the majority pick the tube system. MP3 SUCK!....for music. When MP3 was put in to use bandwidth was much stingier but now in the 21st century is not the case. I lobby for better sound quality.
I've heard about this a number of times. CD quality is 1,411 kbps. It's very hard to tell the difference between 1411 and 320 kbps. Go down to 256 and most people can tell the difference. 320 is good enough at least in the digital world.
Also known as the Beethoven effect.
Still feel that mp3 and 16-bit sound tinny
I don't see why hipsters think it's cool to say shit like, my ears capture more frequencies than you, so i refuse to listen to this format... They're so full of shit.
I'm not trained or an 'audiophile' and I got 4/6, and the ones I got wrong I chose the higher quality of the MP3s, so I would also say that it's 'less wrong' than choosing the other wrong one :p \n\nGiven that chance is 33% I do think you can tell a difference, but still I don't think I would spend thousands on speakers. Not sure what the take home point of the video was though...it randomly turned into something about age?!
I totally agree about WAV compared to 320kbs mp3s, but I do find some difference between FLAC and mp3...
I am 62 years old and my hearing suffers from the same things as you are talking about Rick.  But I can definitely hear the differences in the rendered formats.  In my studio there is no doubt of these differences even between CD quality of 44K 16bit and my recording preferences of 96K or 192K and 24bit.  I can absolutely hear differences in clarity and the imaging of the sound in every case.  I purchased your album to study and I found that in this case however I agree with your reasoning for supplying MP3's instead of WAVs because this does not feel like an audiophile type of situation.  I feel like each one of the pieces is a reflection of your teaching style and was not to be considered audiophile level content.  Although if you had simply supplied the higher resolution content and then left it up to the listener to convert it for their mobile device [or] supply multiple resolutions from your download site this should not be an issue.  (although somebody's going to whine about something whatever you do).
What gets me are the ones that say they can hear the difference between WAV and other lossless codes, like FLAC for example.
There was an spanish online magazine (I don't rememeber the name) dedicted to blow out all the assumptions made by audiophiles, I remeber one test comparing spectral response of OFC wire against the most cheap cooper wire available with no difference at all in the audible range. They also did many double-blind test similar to what we saw in this video. One of them comparing super high-end CD players with super modest ones, results were very embarrasing and equally illustrative.\n\nAll those famous mixing engineers named by Rick are great not because they have a good (physiological) earing or expensive equiment but excellent taste and musical intuition.
There is a very simple reason for wanting something encoded in WAV, or FLAC (Free lossless audio Codec) ... you can encode the file to whatever format you want. Encoding an mp3 to - lets say - opus will be worse, than encoding it from FLAC. WAV / FLAC simply gives you freedom to choose whatever codec you want and still have the best possible quality and smaller file size.
Let's come up with a coding for formats called the Unknown Format. We can use whatever format we want and people who argue this will never know. Out of sight, out of mind.
I don't disagree with you regarding the negligible audible difference however there is another reason why you should offer your music in a non-lossy format, like flac. Transcoding from one lossy format to another (even from mp3 to a different bitrat mp3) causes degradation. If someone has your music in mp3, and for some reason wants it on another format (maybe  as a smaller mp3 for listening on their phone, maybe 10 years from now in some newer format), transcoding it will degrade the quality.
I'd much rather hear Charlie Parker with Strings on my 1970 turntable than any audio file. Call me old fashioned..
Far more important to me is the odious practice of mixing too hot. I'm one of those dinosaurs who still buys CDs, but some of my legacy music purchases have been marred by remastering to up the gain. I can't stand hearing an otherwise great recording pushed to the point where the bass is constantly on the edge of breaking up. It may not be audible in the studio, but by the time it ends up on a CD it's definitely there. Some modern recordings use audible compression-pulsing as an aesthetic choice: sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  I'm thinking here of two albums: OK Computer by Radiohead and Stranger to Stranger by Paul Simon. Exit Music on the Radiohead album uses compression to tremendous effect. But several tracks on Stranger to Strangermake uncomfortable listening for me, at almost any volume. Yes, I like hearing the kick drum up front in the mix, but not to the point where it beats everything either side of the footfall into sonic submission.\nWhat's really annoying is that the signal-to-noise ratio that CD offers, as opposed to vinyl, has made too-hot mixes commonplace. The same malarkey would lead to terrible mastering problems on vinyl: the stylus would just jump out of the groove. Which is, I suppose, why the resurgence of vinyl came about. Just dumb.
Ricky Beats: why don't you use FLAC? :)
Champion 👌🏽
Rick ... I hear ya!
Solution: FLAC
Thank you!!
bad headphone!
Absolutely
Great video.
I did blind test with foobar plugin flac converted to 128kb/s mp3 (44.1) and to 320kb/s (44.1). I guessed 10/11.
Hi Rick, Ed Chang here. I agree that the standard of using wav or flac is 99% bragging rights. One point I'd like to mention out of my own experience tho:\nI used to encode at VBR 0 for awhile. Then I noticed that during fade-ins of high frequency textures/drones (such as found in lots of electronic music (cough including true electronic music such as Gesang der Junglinge :) ) I would hear intermittent dropouts in the volume envelope. However by encoding at 320k, the issue was resolved. All of this falls in line with your argument above.\nI have to say tho, I do mix down and store all of my own music to uncompressed wav, since, obviously those will be mangled in other ways before they get to my iPhone haha! OK great work, peace!
Perhaps if ALL examples were of well recorded  ACOUSTIC instruments, especially of Percussion, cymbals etc she could have scored 80% up.  Because the pop music with dirty synthy patches slant the test imho
What about the difference between 44.1khz to 48khz to 96khz... ain't it there where the real quality improvement can be identified? CD's can only play 44.1khz. that's a restriction that isn't there anymore now!
I don't disagree that the formats are virtually indistinguishable. But testing a naive listener (someone who hasn't spent much time distinguishing between formats) makes no sense. They have no idea what to listen for. The ironic part of this test is that the listener feels it's valid to choose between the formats: they feel that the formats are distinguishable. She didn't finish the test and say, THEY ALL SOUND THE SAME. So they probably don't sound the same.
Scientists noticed that our ears mask those frequencies and we can’t hear them — from where you get those info dear Rick - please pay attention what you spread on the internet - there is enough of bad stuff out there - \nalso for your info - it has nothing to do with finding a work around if they have loss in hearing - the head will compensate for that - as simple as that - no one was born with the same Freq. response on both ears - like everything in your body ;-) \nSeries follower
Rick, i've spent the last week catching up on your latest videos, loving the content....congrats on eclipsing 150,000 subscribers
i got 5/6. and without perfect pitch. explain THAT, Beatus.
It's in the brain, not the ears. :)
I don't have perfect pitch,  my hearing is below average, I don't have a music related PHD, but I sure hear the difference between  an MP3 and a WAVE file. The difference is more emotional than auditory though....
I am so glad to hear this from someone like you. You know, I worked a long time in a studio and my boss was a gearaddict audiophile. He spend so much money into things like 7km high end cables (btw. with crappy isolation and symmetry) or the biggest and most expensive monitors he beliefed in. I almost every month had to do tests of new equipment, just to tell if the old stuff was still good. Peaking in an DAW-Test... And almost every time (without taking my opinion into consideration) his answer was the new stuff sounds better, get rid of this old crappy s***... I am so glad I made the move and go from a monthly paid job to being a freelancer right now.
Hey Jimmy, you are the mentally sick weirdo who put a lot of young women 18s to touch your pants in the street and infront of your cameras expecting all of your viewers to like that..psycho....
Really? Snoop is wearing fake glasses? Seems to be a black thing. Though mostly it seems to be Africans who wear those. Do they think they look more intellectual wearing these fake glasses?
Jimmy Kimmel is a great dude.he loves women just watch him host the man show.beer tittys and a midget that trys to buy beer as a minor.hes not a sexiest how dare you say that
gotta love cry babys still mad Hillary got smashed by trump lol what a bunch of waa waa boi's
what's the difference between kimmel and weinstien? weinsien got caught
wow    i wanted to come to america so badly because i thought the people here were much more mature accepting polite and much better but it seas that grown men are getting in to twitter fights with children and mocking them for something their father did
As soon as late night stops bashing Trump, I'll find something else to watch. I can't get enough of Dumbass Donald jokes.\nKeep it up Jimmy. You've never been better.
Donald Trump IQ test results is: Error 404 brain not found,  IQ test failed 0/99999999999999999....
Snoop you used to be gansta now you looking like a dope head
So you ignored Harvey because someone tweeted at you.  If anyone bought that then America is in trouble. I think you may have a lot in common with Weinstein and it hit home.  Plus your puppetmasters at the studio pulled your silent string.  I guess it was hard tying this into your sons illness. Or perhaps you have lured a few potential starlets.
this guy just appeals for idiots
What's with the politics on talk shows? Jr was literally asking Kimmel for his thoughts. You don't want this kind of thing then ask those stupid media hungry assholes that are in power to stop.
i am positive at least one time in jimmys career, he took advantage of his position and asked for a sexual favor from an intern or something. he is NOT innocent
This was so funny!
Did you think we forgot about your Guess What's In My Pants Game, Jimmy Kimmel?  Your hypocrisy is stunning.  Hollywood is about one second away from imploding.  Do you ever examine your heart?
I like jimmy. Good banter with guests but he reminds us of more important things and shows emotion.
Seems Jimmy here forgot about his time on the man show parading around teens in miniskirts jumping on trampolines.
I'm so glad Trump is Jimmy Kimmel's president ! Hahahahahaha  The more the media and hollywood hate Trump the happier I am. Go Trump !
Jimmy Kimmel was happy to get buggered by Weinstein several times to get his job..TRUE FACT..at least i think so
Any Canadians here just for the drama
The what’s in your pants bit you did is leaps and bounds worse than anything that can be proven against Trump but keep trying to preach to us idiot
Jimmy Kimmel won't touch the Harvey Weinstein story because he's not the moral conscience of America.  Right Jimmy, you're not.  America finds your ilk repulsive.  You defend sexual predators and you are a sexual predator.
Keep forging those tweets and you will be in jail for fraud...
I salute you!  God Bless you and your family!
What's most disturbing, is that Trump jr seems to have no idea that what his dad is doing, is so:  1. Stupid, and 2. Horrible for the vast majority of Americans. Or, he's just lying. Either way, he's a terrible person.
Jimmy don't start a fight, you'll end up crying again.
The Donald Trump criticism show with jimmy kimmel sucks
war between lilliput people...whether great man (gulliver) interferes again?
This show is terrible...they all are now.
Just from his repeatitive speech skit, it's obvious he's just full of cliche business slogans and has no original independant thoughts in that empty head of his lol
He doesn't get flu shots. Come on.
RememberJimmy did bit and had 18 yr old girl grab and guess what's in his crotch??!! It's a famous segment he did on his show which is on YouTube. 
Clownest president ever.
Jimmy Kimmel is a complete utter fake tosser.
Where are your weinstein jokes...so sad what you became.
we don't believe you Mr =======
Here’s How Trump Has Silently Gutted Obama’s Legacy\nPosted By Robert Donachie On 11:30 AM 10/13/2017\n\nPresident Donald Trump has surgically dismantled Obamacare over the course of his first year in office, largely under the noses of the American public, Democrats and members of his party that have spent the last nine months trying to upend the American health care system.\n\nOver the course of his first nine months in office, he rolled back funding for a program intended to help individuals navigate the insurance marketplace, signed an executive order to allow for groups to purchase insurance across state lines and stopped federal funding for Obamacare subsidies.\n\nTaken in tandem, it appears the administration is working to overhaul the American health care system without the help of Congress, a body that has failed a handful of times to repeal and replace Obamacare during the first months of Trump’s presidency.\n\nEach of these actions has a significant impact on the viability of the current health care system.\n\nObamacare Subsidies\n\nThe Trump administration announced late Thursday evening that it will no longer fund a crucial feature of Obamacare that helps low-income Americans purchase health insurance on the Affordable Care Act state exchanges, known as cost-sharing reductions.\n\n“The bailout of insurance companies through these unlawful payments is yet another example of how the previous administration abused taxpayer dollars and skirted the law to prop up a broken system,” the White House said in a statement. “Congress needs to repeal and replace the disastrous Obamacare law and provide real relief to the American people.”\n\nUnder the leadership of former Speaker John Boehner, the House filed suit against the Obama administration in 2014, claiming it was illegally reimbursing marketplace insurers for CSRs.\n\nObamacare subsidies were instituted to help low and moderate income individuals who participate in the exchanges. To make consumers put more “skin in the game,” Obamacare effectively raised deductibles to levels that are tough for many Americans to meet without some financial support. CSRs were put in place to help compensate insurance companies for coinsurance, co-pays and deductibles that low-income consumers could not otherwise pay out on their own.\n\nBoehner, along with House leadership, felt that CSRs required an annual appropriation approved by Congress. The House argued that because Congress had never explicitly appropriated the funds for those payments, the administration’s actions were unconstitutional. After nearly two years of deliberation, Senior Judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Rosemary M. Collyer concluded the House’s claim had legal standing and allowed the case move forward on May 12, 2016.\n\nOver the course of the past 16 months, the Obama and Trump administrations have kicked the court hearing back. For those that side with Republicans, a troubling result of the appeal and numerous delays is that CSRs are still funded as they were when the Obama administration first appealed. Trump’s move Thursday essentially ends the debate, unless Congress chooses to act.\n\nOne of the glaring problems with abruptly stopping CSR payments is that it will likely lead to skyrocketing premiums for Obamacare enrollees. Roughly half of the consumers who purchase health insurance through Obamacare qualify for cost-sharing reductions\n\nConsumers are already facing double-digit premiums under Obamacare, but stopping the subsidies for insurance companies means the costs that insurers are not getting covered from the government will get transferred to the consumer.\n\nWhen insurance providers signaled they would drop out of the Obamacare market altogether in 2017, one of their primary concerns was whether or not Trump would continue paying out these subsidies.\n\nThe federal government was slated to pay out around $7 billion in CSRs in 2017. Obamacare consumers saw their out-of-pocket costs lower by over $1,000 through these subsidies.\n\nCongress could still act on the 2014 lawsuit and stymie Trump’s move. If they do not, Obamacare customers are likely to see their premiums and out-of-pocket costs soar in the future.\n\nObamacare Navigator Funding\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that many of the Obamacare programs are merely a superluous use of time and resources, including the navigator program. As such, the administration announced in September that it would cut some of the navigator program’s funding by as much as 90 percent.\n\nObamacare navigators are individuals that help consumers and businesses seek and obtain health insurance plans that meet their specific needs. They also provide outreach and educational assistance surrounding the health care marketplace.\n\nOver 70% of regional programs and 55% of statewide navigators anticipate rolling back programs in rural areas because of the administration’s funding cuts, Kaiser Family Foundation reports. The overwhelming majority, or 89 percent, of navigators expect having to fire staff because of the cuts.\n\nCuts to navigators are important in that the Obamacare marketplace can be difficult to navigate, even for an experienced consumer.\n\nThe majority of navigators, despite the cuts, plan on participating in the market in 2018.\n\nExecutive Order\n\nTrump signed an executive order Thursday that charged a number of federal agencies with finding ways to expand access to health insurance plans that are outside of Obamacare regulations. The order relaxes the rules and regulations surrounding association health plans — groups of small businesses (and possibly individuals) that join together to purchase insurance. The order would also allow these groups to purchase insurance across state lines.\n\n“With these actions … We are moving toward lower costs and more options in the health care market, and taking crucial steps toward saving the American people from the nightmare of Obamacare,” the president said Thursday.\n\n“This will direct [agencies] to take action to increase competition, increase choice, and increase access to lower-cost, high-quality health-care options,” Trump added. “This will cost the United States virtually nothing, and people will have great, great health care.”\n\nFollow Robert on Twitter\nSend tips to robert@dailycallernewsfoundation.org\n\nhttp://dailycaller.com/2017/10/13/heres-how-trump-has-silently-gutted-obamas-legacy/
Considering how big of a story this Harvey Weinstein thing is, Jimmy Kimmel took it very easy on him on this monologue.
And now Kimmel is on tape having young women feel around his groin area and asking them to put whatever is in there in their mouth.
fun fact: Jimmy sold his soul to satanic Hollywood, the night he succumbed to wearing a tie.
Still waiting for some fake tears for the black on black murders in Chicago, Harvey's victims, etc....waiting for the Hollywood hypocrite.
Hey Kimmel how come you don't ever start your'e monolog  without a Trump bashing .... why don't you start one with the sexual tyrants in your'e own Hollywood elite liberal community don't you think you should or do you have something to hide also? tabout Harvey Weinstein or the alleged allegations  about Oliver Stone WHY IS THAT?????

SNAP

https://xn--g0haaaaaaaaaaaa.gq/r/?S8RGoh0KMu3rc=2vFo3i3TaO8ncJnMThxLOBU1zJLSdN76moJ
Jimmy is killing it these days.
I love when he uses most people don't even know when it comes to common knowledge, like Lincoln being a Republican,and countless others!
what a whiner.  go home
Hey Jimmy you hypocrite, how was that 18 year old you had feel you up on the Man Show in 2002?
Forgot Harvey Weinstein, what about you, you creep Jimmy!?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBDYGOzViuI\n\nHey girls, feel what's in my pants, use your mouth if you want.
jimmy, I hope your kid takes its last breathe.
That I can tell you and I guarantee it are both things I say all the time... Ugh...
Jimmy 👏🏽 back was amazing!!!!! DJTJ stay in your lane.... I’m starting to believe that the stupid gene is Contagious and I guarantee it maybe “ in my DJTS voice”
Look at Jimmy getting down with all the colored people at 1:35. Lol, modern slavery at its finest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZ8i6EGH4FI\nSTOP BLAMING GUNS! Howard Stern DESTROYS the gun control Argument
Dotard Jr. is gonna learn to stay in a child's place after that. Lmao
What's in your pants, Jimmy?
Harvey Weinstein for 2020..he has all the qualification for it like the orange baboon.
Jimmy Kimmel, 'the conscience of America' has teenage girls grope his croutch for a seat see his show.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnGInJ5C-qI
so ScrewYouTube allows AdSense on fight videos - ok, got it
I think next time Jimmy bashes Trump .. let Sean Hannity take the reins .. to respond. He would mop the floor with Kimmel.
Honestly, I had no idea who Harvey Weinstein was before this.
Jimmy don't worry you're anniversary of that time where you had women with big breast jump up and down on a trampoline is coming up too.
And cue more trump hate. Stop it and your ratings will go up
Why don't Twitter BAN Trump's account? What would he do? It could be a lot of fun😜
What’s in your pants Jimmy?  You hypocrite.
I think jimmy is avoiding this issue as he wants people to forget about “The Man Show”, which was a sexist as you can get. I loved that show, but I don’t go around calling people mysogynists and sexual predators while ignoring the ones I support or are friends with.
I lasted 15 seconds. Which is long for me 😉
I only feel bad for donald trump jr for his name, Donald Trump, literally this explains how much ego Trump (the president) has
Dude, Joey from friends would make a way better president than Trump :)
Hollywood is a cesspool. It is time to shut it down.
Jimmie Kimmel, the guy from the man show. That sexist show.
I love this guy! Never afraid to say what he stands for.
Anyone else see that video of Jimmy Kimmel sexually harassing women with his fame and influence?  Rub my crotch, I'm Jimmy Kimmel!  It's ok, I'm famous and stuff... another disgusting Hollywood hypocrite hack.
Ah Jimmy, the equivalent of cancer. Seems to like making fun of other people when he can't even control his own face, let alone his ego.
FAKE NEWS!
Jimminy hypocrite.
That I can tell You!
Hi I am Donald trump. I know I am about to start WWIII with Korea but never fear WE GOT TRUMP CARE
Yet still no passionate speech about Harvey weinstein
Amateur YouTuber starting out check out my vids!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love Jimmy Kimmel 😍💚
lmao xD
I honestly love you!
Love you Jimmy
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOO
👏
ayy nice rape joke get clapping audience
Trump 2020
Jr. was defending his dad....understandable....Kimmel come on slamming a kid...that is a new low....he s a teen besides Trump didn't look great at his last signing of the Healthcare Executive Order....possible heart failure on the horizon from so much stress...I don't like him as President either but pushing a man into heart failure whom you know is extremely stressed about his image and his accomplishments is just mean along with tweeting his father s mistakes politicially....he is not his father nor shown signs yet of his father s actions and if anything children learn from their father s mistakes as well as do better in life....we are all an example of how to live or not to live....don't beat up on a child whose not responsible for his father s actions...DJ Junior is responsible for his own actions NOT his father s...really disappointed....the visciousness still going on when the decision has been made for Presidency....and I ve made mean comments but beating up on the child on social media...wow that is low.
They really need to suspend Trump from using Twitter. He needs to worry about his country. Like God, Obama was so much better :/
Wake up call everyone.  This is not how a President—who is a role model (!) should act!  There should not be just one finger on the nuclear button!  I find Kimmel refreshing.  This crazy behaviour of Trump's is dangerous.  There is a group of psychiatric professionals that are starting a dialogue with members of Congress called, The Duty to Warn. They believe that Trump is dangerous to the public and as mental health professionals they have a “duty to warn” the public about what they see as Trump’s narcissism, impulsivity, poor attention span, paranoia, and other traits that, they believe, impair his ability to lead.
The Trumpettes are such dorks. EVERY day they cry that Jimmy hasn't addressed Harvey Weinstein ...oblivious to the fact that he addressed at the beginning of his first show after the scandal broke
Hahahaha! TRUMP Repetitive tapes are right on point!!! Thanks Jimmy K.
Okay we get it, you hate trump, can we move on to some real comedy now?
Harvey Weinstein everybody.\nHe is just the top of the ice-berg from the stinking bubble that is Hollywood. Kimmel, go after him! why are you not after him like you constatly were Trump? ohh yeah thats right! because he is a part of your bubble!! you can't handle that! again fricking hypocrites the lot of you!
The only thing funny about Kimball is his Trump obsession.
People actually watch cancerous shows like this and honestly wonder why our country is so divided...?
Everybody talking about unsolved but did y'all realize this man  learned to fly by sneaking into random homes and playing simulations. He wild 😂
plot twist: the narrator is colton harris moore
I like bare feet
The mini doc on tv about this guy is really interesting!
I live in mount vernon...
wow he was born on the same day I was born!well not on the same year tho
Ryan and Shane should just make their own channel . I'm sure it would take off . We need unsolved everyday not lame filler waiting for it to come out .
Guys get over it they missed an episode be happy with the free content you are getting
Why does this sound like Mr nightmare .. ?
He used to live in a half way house next to my apartments, that's where he actually ran way from, he shot our neighbors window out with a BB gun
BATHS ARE ILLEGAL OML I HAVE TO TELL THIS TO MY MOM
Can we leave the crime stories to Shane and Ryan? Please?
why does his voice sounds like Rami Malek
Come on guys, this isnt an unsolved mystery, nor does it say unsolved anywhere in the title. Obviously not going to be an episode of unsolved.
His mother lived next door to my aunt’s farm on a small island in Washington! Always signs saying do not enter, etc.
I hope he gets to fly again!!!
Was it just me or were there not enough details to make this story interesting??
I thought this was buzzfeed unsolved...disappointed
Why are people butthurt about this not from Unsolved when the title clearly reads Crazy story of the Barefoot bandit? It's pretty clear that this not an Unsolved episode. Idiots.
I want a shirt with hey demons its me ya boi printed on it
Here for the unsolved comments
Stop comparing it to buzzfeed unsolved ! I actually really like this it was so positive ! You just have to watch it all the way though.
IT WAS MOSE BUT IN SOCKS
Just like I am obsessed with BuzzFeed unsolved. I come to YouTube . Refresh the application again and again everyday to watch a new video, even though I know it comes on Friday. 😂
hey that's where I live
I don't like the narrator .... His voice isn't interesting
I thought it was buzzfeed unsolved then I realized its not the day they post
Who else thought this was a surprise unsolved video?
My old co worker is currently dating this guy
Little town power electric tour wave.
I was born on March 22 too
I dont think people realize that this guy is like a modern day legend in the Bahamas XD
thank you for doing him!!! for unsolved crime,  can y'all  do Sherri Pepini?
He broke into our house and stole some food and a dirt bike which he left broken down in the woods.
Was this story supposed to have a point?
Honestly whoever is doing the voiceover, your voice is 😍😍😍😍
I clicked on this misreading it as 'bigfoot bandit' and now I'm disappointed
no crimes unless it's unsolved maybe they want to give you some crime vids bc the current unsolved season is supernatural and they're tired of y'all complaining 🙃🙃🙃
why is everyone thought this was unsolved? we all know that unsolved uploads every friday. smh
Unlike a lot of people in the comments, I like crime videos along with unsolved videos so thanks for the extra cool vid
0:14 THE PRIDE OF MOUNT VERNON
Only here for all the comments about Unsolved. Looking forward to Friday as well.
Bare foot\nB foot\nBig foot\nCase Solved\n(I know it isn't Buzzfeed Unsolved)
Ahh! I finally just shared my coming out story!!
I remember when he was running around our islands. I’m sure that bastard stole my bike 😂
This was actually an interesting video, I liked it.\nThe video and its visual reenactment was well edited, in my opinion.\n\nSure, it's not Shane and Ryan, but this channel isn't all about them, they don't have their own channel, but maybe they'll be moved to their own channel like LadyLike.\n\nBut people gotta chill, man.\n\nThe people who did this video were cool to do this. I've never heard of this story before and it's pretty bizzare and out there.
Wtf ? Y'all better stopppp, this not Shane & Ryan bye.
There's no [WHEEZE]. I'm disappointed.
I knew this ain't unsolved but still clicked it hoping that it might be 1% related to UNSOLVED.  The wheezes got me addicted.. Sorry not sorry. 😀 Can't wait for the new season starting today.  Shout out to Ryan and Shane,  I love you guys.
I don't know all the crimes he committed but I don't feel he deserved 7 years, he was underage and trying to survive.
this is almost like a modern story of icarus and the sun....with the sun being his obsession/source of obsession to fly.
i did a project on this dude
That is a really cool story. I wish him the best.
Ok people put together the clues ok listen \n\nFriday \nBuzzed unsolved \n\n\n\nWhat can u infer by this \n\n\n\n\n\nYou buzzed videos only come out on Fridays I know it’s sucks
when it’s been over a week since the last buzzfeed unsolved and you settle for this
I remember watching a document on him like 3 years ago
Was this a class project Buzzfeed?
pfffft, The Barefoot Bandit is nothing, have you ever ran into THE WET BANDITS??
How tF do you steal a plane
ummm,leave the crime stuff to the unsolved team
*why does every criminal story I hear happen in Washington state?!* I live in Washington state!
BuzzFeed is doing a lot of storytimes
as soon as i didn’t hear ryan’s voice i was pissed
This sounds like me. I go everywhere barefoot....I never leave prints tho (;
I thought it was big foot
when Unsolved is your most popular segment so you try to incorporate it into other videos
This should be an unsolved episode
How do you fly a plane and not get caught
He was actually caught at a resort/restaurant/marina called Romora Bay in Harbour Island, Bahamas! My family used to go there all the time and the staff would wear shirts saying how they caught the Barefoot Bandit!
Where’s oily sheen shane 😂😂
This would be a fucking great movie
WE GET IT U THOUGHT IT WAS UNSOLVED GEEZ 😂
I don't get why everyone thought this was a buzzers unsolved video. They literally tell you the series, season, & episode #
i love all the crime videos. i just don’t get why people are complaining that this isn’t unsolved, this is a bonus for people interested in this stuff
Fucking this isnt buzzfeed unsolved. More like buzzfeed disappointment
I read Bigfoot. I'm disappointed
I thought this was buzzfeed unsolved 😭😭😭
I thought it was unsolved, wtf
*wheeze
Wtf
Murder of Selena Quintanilla

Aha, you forgot something... *WHEEZE*
(Wheeze)
That's such an awesome story.
This animation was amazing.
Love this
who the hell dislikes this??
This is fucking cool and I appreciate it.
This was such a lovely surprise
Great animation! Where's my vault package at tho? Still haven't gotten it😂
Animation and Storytelling are both Ace. One gets the feeling that when Jack (John) really connects with someone, who has a heart as pure as his own, it's friends forever. Not many folks care to remember for a minute what you really want most let alone years. \n🎸🐧💙
Things like these are what makes life worth living.
Wow, what a tale :) Awesome animation!
Cried during that show.
This makes my heart ache for The White Stripes even more, especially since this was the last performance they did. I wish things wouldn't have fallen apart the way they did and that maybe some day by some miracle by the grace of God they can reunite and do even more great things. If Guns N' Roses can manage it, I don't see why The White Stripes can't.
Jack and Meg need to get back together for just one last gig
What a very nice little animation. I love it.
I love Conan and I love Jack and Meg
Thank you for the video :)
This was a beautiful story and video, thanks. :)
This is fucking amazing, god I wish they'd come back now more than ever. I really hope Meg is doing okay
was also tws last ever performance :(
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Amazing. Love it.
TEAM COCO FOREVER <3
That's awesome#
Beautiful
CRYING
Fantastic!
Very cool
The 333 White Stripes!! 🐧 Thanks Coco

Wow...
Pure perfection by Moth Studio
So freaking cool
This is 💯!
Brilliant! Great storytelling!
♥
Awesome sauce
I hope it's free to watch her full documentary
So proud of Demi 💞 One of the realist artist out here . She’s amazing 💜
i;m so excited, honestly its an understatement omggggg im ready <33333
I'd let Demi punch my face.
Why is she so fucking gourgeous!!! i mean out of this world fucking beautifullllllll
Go Demi! You inspire me everyday to be honest and kind! Ilysm!
why am i already crying!!! i can't wait for this
Demi is like another regular youtuber but more inspiring 😭❤️
Why is she so freaking INSPIRATIONAL... Like omg! I LOVE HER SO MUCH😭😭
So fucking proud of you Demi, I've loved you since day one. Followed you on your entire journey. You saved my life, when I was bullied to the point where I felt like there was no reason to live anymore, I turned to you, your music, your life, and you really saved my life. I love you so much, I will meet you one day and tell you this in person because I know you most likely won't see this.
Does anyone realize at 1:30 she does the nick jonas dance? lol....hm. I ship nemi here.
The truth is always displayed on the face. It's a problem for everyone. This women has a face like a slapped spoilt child's arse.\nOne, she's American, so for the money she will dress herself up as a nun to get it if she has to. \nBut the face can't lie.\nAll this use of reality TV is pure invention. Scripted lies for the money. Time will prove the point, wait and see. You can't hide the truth with pretty.\nThough they think the every day people are to thick to see the manipulation.
IM SO FREAKING PROUD OF YOU DEMI, LOVATICS WILL ALWAYS STAND BY YOUR SIDE❤
Im so excited for this. I swear ive watched the trailer 10 times today. ❤
This makes me feel so powerful💗💗💗love you demi
Demi- Yeah\nMe- ...\nDemi- I mean Thank You\nMe- (just smiling)\nPS writing this comment made me realize today when most of the time I felt I'm not beautiful (basically everyday) but for a moment and at certain angle I was looking good, so when someone said I was looking really pretty at that moment, I said yeah, I know with happy voice, but yes, I can be more polite too, ps it's really hard to show your dark side so it's amazing to see you doing this
I'm so excited and super happy for you Demi😙😙😙💖💖💖
When is this coming out
Your amazing and you are such a huge role model to me and so many other people. Don't give up, your on the road to something so great! We will all be cheering you on, on the sidelines. I love you so much and keep doing you beautiful😍
Can someone please tell me what is all this??? I mean what's simply complicated is it a song or What?
Sure, she's an out of this world singer and musician but THIS RIGHT HERE is why I love Demi. Her honesty and vulnerability is so INSPIRING because it is so rare, especially in the industry. When you put yourself out there like she does you will get more feedback; therefore more criticism. Sometimes it's hard to know where to draw the line and Demi doesn't always think before she talks (or tweets) which can get her in trouble. People are not always going to like what she has to say or agree with it. I don't always agree with everything she says and does. But I respect her for standing up for what she believes in and being true to herself. You can say a lot of things about Demi but you CAN'T say that she's fake (or a bad singer). It's not easy to talk about your most inner demons the way Demi is. Not a lot of people do but we all have them. We all go through our own struggles and we all make mistakes. But we live in a world where everyone feels like they have to have it all together all the time. Be perfect. It's not just okay to be true to yourself, it's NECESSARY. Wearing a mask throughout your entire life eventually gets tiring and exhausting. TAKE THE MASK OFF. STOP PRETENDING. BE YOURSELF. BE STRONG. LOVE YOURSELF. LOVE OTHERS. BE KIND. BE BADASS.
so proud of you! i love you <3
Is it going to be on red??
I fucking love u demi i have nothing but love and respect for u you are a queen @ddlovato #lovatic4life💋💯💋💖💖
i've been a fan of demi for essentially my entire life. she was one of my first albums ever bought with 'don't forget' and the only artist whose album i've made sure to buy with every release. i just turned 19 about a month ago so i've basically grown up with demi & am so excited for the documentary release. despite being a fan for almost a decade, i feel like this is going to be the first time i actually get to learn about her.
So proud of you love!!! ❤️❤️❤️
I cannot wait to see this. I really felt for her when she was going through all the rough stages of her early fame. I hated it so much when she went to rehab and disappeared but knew it was best for her. I’m so happy she’s finally at a point where she doesn’t feel like she has to rely on drugs or men to be happy
Anxiety  all. Sicknesses and diseases come from rebellion against god our. Creator which connects.  To.  A spirit. Of manipulatuon deceit and control aka witchcraft...disobedience comes from.not loving god get to kno him we all disobey ask him to.help u obey heal u noone can survive these battles on they own god helps u with it all thru jesus christ who came in the flesh it starts with prayer and asking him to.lead u to the truth show u.his luv for u.protect u.guide u bk to.the garden of eden that heals u...only.the spirit.of god n his power rebuke demons but they came for a reason and thats what we have to.learn from see sin activates curses exodus 20 is what protects us from allllll evil read Deuteronomy 28 and obedience activates curses this is the way God  set it.up he knew we will mess up.so he sent his son the churches dont teach this cause god aint in.it acts 17:25 the church is in us...the spirit of god is the church ...dont leave this word without getting to kno him stay woke boo

That is so surreal they talk about the airplane incident. She was supposed to come to argentina with the jonas brothers and I was going to that concert (because of the jobros not her). But it was massive news.  It'll be nice to hear from them what that time was like.

I've been a fan since Camp Rock and Sonny with a Chance. Seeing Demi Lovato find herself even in her darkest times gave me the confidence to do the same! Thank you for having all the courage in the world to put this documentary out there for others to see! I LOVE YOU DEMI LOVATO!!!
So proud of her, been a Lovatic since day one😍😭😭👏🏽 we needed it
This makes me cry. Not because it’s sad, because it’s so inspiring, lovely and so amazing how strong this woman is. How much of an idol she is. She is my inspiration and I long to be just like her, in the best way possible. 🖤
Girl why did you make me eyes sweat so bad!?!!!
So proud of you honey❤️
Not matter what we see in the video, we will support demi because she deserve all the love from us after every sacrifice she done for us. We love you demi, LOVATICS LOVE YOU FOR LIFE

Exclusively for YouTube Red subscribers? This should’ve been as a Netflix Original Documentary.
Can she even write a bad song? Next time I'm just hitting Like before I even listen.
Lyrics:\n\nThere's a hole in the dry wall, still not fixed. I just haven't gotten around to it and besides, I'm starting to get used to the gaps. Say wish you could find some way to live to be so hard on myself, so why is it easy for everyone else. I'm not always like this, there's always tomorrow, I guess.\n\nAnd I never do it but it's not a joke. I can't tell the difference when I'm all alone. Is it real or a dream, which is worse, can you help me? I just wanted to go to sleep.\n\nWhen I turn out the lights. When I turn out the lights. There's no one left between myself and me.\nBut when I turn out the lights. When I turn out the lights. When I turn out the lights, there's no one left between myself and me.\n\n\n\nJB's new single is amaze y'all. Enjoy it. I sure am. 😊
I'm actually gonna fly from Moscow to Paris just to see her show in November...
This album is gonna be amazing.
Turn Out The Lights debuted at #9 on the New Alternative 40 Chart this week:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV1dMqeb4_U&list=PLxlSBzMcrtkMCVtuXEIz5BXpPfycTwsS5&index=9
She makes me want to be a better person
This a bop, I'm crying but this a bop
This is an entirely new level! Can't wait to hear her new album!
The tears are real son
Omg I wasn't prepared for this
And I thought I couldn't love her more
The perfect way to kick off fall is with a new Julien Baker song and a good cry. This is wonderful. <3
Entirely in love with her.
Greatness.
It's Julien. Of course I'm gonna love it
Only person in my life that makes me feel something and I'm tired of feeling nothing. ♥️🏳️‍🌈
So lovely, u are are my favorit artist Julien.
No one inspires me more than Julien does. Absolutely cannot wait to see her next week.
Darn. My life’s changed forever since I found Julien, and each song touches my soul in places I didn’t know existed before... Thank you.
When you ugly cry into a pillow for a solid hour, but it’s the best part of your day
Julien, you just get me. Thank you.
This song is a masterpiece <3
A new sooooong!
YES
24 forest guards didn't like the video.
Got to see her when she played in New Zealand! I'm hoping she tours this album here again, she's the best female artist in the world.
D A M N Jesse Cale music taste be poppin h a r d
Her songs would be great on Shameless
imagine a parody video that's just a cat chasing a laser
SO glad Jesse Cale recommended this song. I'm obsessed.
I was incredibly excited for this recording. But it would seem some studio person thought she needed her vocals layered. Please listen to the incredible live performance and stop trying to fix perfection... for fucks sake. Sorry for being a downer.
ya boi is crying now
i can't wait to see her on the 28th. what an angel
Slowly it start to sound similar...
well I just had 3:35 minutes of goosebumps
I hope she doesn't sprain her ankle with all that running.
I like how her latest 2 vids have just been her walking around singing
Y'all, I don't know if I'm emotionally prepared for this new album
really wished I could have seen her open for jason isbell at the ryman the other night! she's amazing.
There's so many reasons why it hurts to watch her perform and listen
She is something special
Beautiful song! Masterful video! Great job Julien and crew! Wish you all the best!
In portuguese, we have some expressions to descrive fellings, things, in this case music, that we fell like overwhelming. Its:«do caraças!». the music of little Julien Baker is... do caraças.
I'm not always like this, there's always tomorrow I guess.
in my Julien-trance, forever...
The use of 35mm color film here is something from out of a dream. It’s subconscious and unreal. The shot of Julien coming out of the smoke before she starts running is my favorite.
I love her and so happy shes releasing new music.
I remember the first time I heard it live. Damn, I had goosebumps everywhere. I love that song. I love Julien. Can't wait for the new cd to come out.
Me vs Maradona vs Elvis. So much Brand New in this song. Love it
I like how the wire is not actually burning its way through the place, but is just being pulled while the end has a sparkling effect to it :D\nthis song tho <3
We need a song with Julien Baker and Dallas Green
Oh my gosh! Even the sound of her footsteps in the beginning gave me goosebumps.
My god this woman can do no wrong. Simply amazing! Whoever disliked this video; FOR SHAME MAN!!!
She's an angel sounds so beautiful Love her voice gives me goosbumps
It's in 4:3 so you sure as hell no it's artistic ;)
Pretty awesome, at the end 2017 it was a good year 😍
Recently discovered Juliens music by accident. Now I need this album
I know its not her style, but im a sucker for at 2:30 if a full band came in and just thrashed the outro
I love every new song more than the last. The only downside of an artist like Julien is that every re-listen to one of her songs will never be as good as that first emotional journey, one where you could never be  sure of what was about to hit you. It still hits you of course, but I wish I could go into every song having never listened to it before.
Woke up to a notification about this video (southern hemisphere). DAY MADE.
Ouch oof owie my emotions
Goosebumps. Pure art. Oct 27th please hurry.
Magical sound
I just said goodbye to the plan for the day.
Julien can simply do no wrong
♡ !!
wow!
Beautiful
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
<3
test in accuse rmtcbc limb pilot media weather softly beginning.

AHHHW WOW :O
Ofuk.jpg
holy crap! Although she writes kinda sad songs they always fit for every kinda mood....
wtf shes a crack
The mother Fucking GOAT. Best music I've heard in the last few years.
Damn this is overall boring. The music is so slow and unoriginal and the lyrics try too hard to display significance...not to mention the video is just a number of cliched scenes edited together
When you hear that guitar in the intro you know it's gonna be fire
Man new music everywhere (Julien Baker, The Front Bottoms, Knuckle Puck, Beck) loving fall so far
i'm not cry, i'm not cry 😢😭
Beautiful. A perfect song.
How is she running after that sprained ankle?
This video was shot next to my house
what camera is used?
Love it, love it....LOVE it!
i listen to julien when i'm having emotional breakdowns
what if she sing with dallas green?
Hello, tonight I'd like to test some of our favorite and as well as some new sounds that can be triggering for you while testing my new mic set. I do need to work on some settings and get pop-filters still but overall I think these are pretty good :D What do you think? \n0-02:10 - intro and voice test\n02:19 - rolling crinkles sound\n05:55 - comb in the plastic ♥ \n09:47 - brushing of the mics\n13:27 - purple beads waterfall\n15:53 - crinkly sticky sounds\n17:47 - bumpy clicky sounds\n18:30 - shell beads high pitch clicky sounds ♥ \n19:41 - fast tapping on a smooth foam sheet ^_^ mmmm\n20:41 - light slime squishing and tapping \n21:36 - whisper test and goodbyes :) \nThank you, I hope you enjoyed it! ♥
1k people who watched this video got *triggered intensely* in the wrong way
YOU LOOK SO GOOD IN THIS WOW. ♡
You’ve really outdone yourself Maria. I barely lasted the intro before I was asleep.
this gave me the most tickles i've ever had in an asmr video!! loveed it <3
I was havin neck pain and it was makin me sick but this helped relax me
I can actually hear your heart beating!!!! those mics are insane, as are momentum 2 headphones (also senheiser)
Absolutely loved the new mics! Such clean, clear sound. Question,  have you done or plan to do a video with singing bowls? MassageASMR does several and they are great, but I would love to hear your voice narrate one!  :)
Love that jersey you have on 👍
Where do I subscribe to the pink comb channel?
This was a amazing test.Please please please do Moore.
Stop with the hands. You look like a bad street magician.
Most asmrs give me tons of anxiety but yours didnt thanks!!
I wonder what she would do for us, if we saved the world..
The whispering was amazing! Holy heck! Can you please do whispering video?
The pink comb is just simply amazing! 😍💕
My god you are stunning😍😍😍
You help me forget about the monsters in my house. Then I have dreams me and the monsters are all in a musical that takes place in my neighbourhood.  And then I realize the monsters want me dead.
You remind me of my ex that cheated on me
That was really good. I love the camera effects and the brush. Your hair looks great too :D
I can't be the only person that wants to eat her out😍😭
Is this Lois Lane?
Oddly enough, you almost biting the fake pumpkin was a trigger...
I love your outfit! You look so pretty!
Is it just me or is Maria de-aging? She's honestly glowing and I'm living for it.
I Love These Microphones!! such amazing sound. please do more
I know im late but thank you. I was needing this. Badly. 😊
just loved this mic, Maria. you're really ahead everyone else! congrets!!
I actually got tingles from the neck smelling lol and was pretty accurate since I just took a shower
I like the white noise doe. Reminds me of a fan in the background, very relaxing. Nice mics doe
I've tried asmr with headphones this is so much better !!
God you're so pretty
Is this your natural scent?
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS CHOKER AND THE SWEATER YES MAM MARIA😍😍🔥🔥
Gonna sound weird, but I think you're pregnant
When you thought her vids couldn't get anymore binaural
Love these videos only just discovered asmr :) I get this intense pressure between my ears and goosebumps/tingling its awesome 😁
Imagine playing a hardcore FPS game with these microphones.
Beautiful choker! I have the same one!❤️
Amazing... I feel like flying!!!
Omg I have the same necklace but could never figure out how to wear it! Yours looks so cute!
I like your sweater. It is cute. Did you alter it?
Is it wrong if I loved this video?!
2:35 LOL I thought you started eating it 😂
Another favorite! My favorite part was actually the very end. Breathy whispers are my favorite trigger. 👐👐
I’m simple girl see Maria \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike video and fall asleep
THOSE NEW MICROPHONES ARE SO TINGLY

Hard to go wrong with Sennheiser.

Dear Maria, THANK YOU for this video. It was the first time I fell asleep listening to ASMR ever.\nIt was so weird to wake up with headphones all around my face, haha.

9:52 SO HOT ! YOUR MAKEUP AND HAIR PULLED TO THE SIDE LIKE THAT! VERY CLASSY LOOKING

I wonder if she gives herself Asmr in these videos?
i love your video Maria you are so nice and beautifull :)
I am loving the new mics!!💜💜
You look like Amy Adams
what do you think?\n\nSimplynailogical is SHAKING
Your tingle-face is like mine! Lol!\n😂😂
You look so reminiscent of a 90's teen supermodel here, especially around the 6:00 mark.
When you said you were never EVER taking the comb out of the plastic, you weren't lying. And I'm glad you weren't :D
thank you so much for spending a lot of time just to help us sleep and relax haha it’s really nice of you. i love your channel! ♡
Does she like the sound of earthquakes
The brush was amazing
Please do a full whisper video with these mics!! The back whispering effect is so heavenly😍😍 and amazing video as usual 💛💛

In terms of tingles, this is one of favorite videos of yours.. and I’ve been watching for the past 5 years.. in other words those mics are amazing, I can’t wait to see what u do with them ❤️hugs !
I haven't watched asmr videos in a while just bc I haven't had the free time and maaaan I missed it. Great video! U look especially nice in this video too, love the choker and outfit!

Where's the school uniform and one glove look? I prefer it when you look like a clown. And when are you going to do something other than going to chicken and chip shops. If my son ate at chicken and chip shops like they were Michelin star joints I'd disown him.
My man takes months off and comes back looking like Oprah Winfrey
I'm not a hater at all but my man really does need a trim lol. It's mad having a sick job but donny's in need of a diet now. I saw a comment down below saying he's looking like Big Narstie now. This shit ain't healthy brudda.

This black Ass peice of shit have degraded the black woman on so many levels.  Im a proud black woman but i will spit on this peice of shit.  U sexy as A Motherfuck!
They playing
Dwayne Johnson it's about time you addressed his black ass. Not only does his independent music sound like shit but he looks like a big black piece of long shit while he's dissing black  women and going on his senseless rants that nobody cares about. Thank you Dwayne  we know he's not worth your time but that's what he wanted  your time since he's not working  that's all he has is time. Keep winning Mr.Johnson
This is an old video and The Rock was joking.
Now I know he is mad but that album was good. He is just being mean I hate to see these two brothas at each other's throats like this.
This is an old video. He was only joking. Tyrese is a cry baby and a diva.
Thanks Dwayne. All he does is diss black women. Fuck this nigga. Black as his black ass IS. He got some fucking nerve.
If my love for The Rock was slowly fading. The love has been restored after watching this. Shout out to The Rock boo!
To fucking funny mr. Johnson is hilarious
Lmfao damn he's childish and not the mother fucker at the end😂😂
Tyrees, need to stop you seriously got issues. Start to believe the story about you abusing your daughter. You and Rock was cool and then you going to start shit because, of a movie, stop the bullshit life is to short for nonsense✌🏾😜
The rock is the king of petty y'all must not have seen WWF LOL
He's my moms face
EXCUSE ME Rocks wife, I must say u have 1 fine Ass Husband.   Get that show on tv as quick as possible so ur fans can watch u weekly.  Keep pumping that Iron cause that body is the Rock! Cute face ball head makes u hotter!   I hope u have Luv scenes!
that was fucked up
This guys supposed to be rich, yet he lives in a trailer??
Guys I just looked up that album it came out 2 years ago apparently.
It's all for publicity
What in the actual fuck is happening
Dwayne is over rated. Fuck you dwayne
THAT ALBUM IS FROM 2015 WTF IS THIS????????????
DAM ROCK YOU WENT IN LIKE  THE BAD MF YOU ARE👍👍👍👍
Even if this was a joke.  We all know any album tyrone puts out is donkey shit
He needs to get his motherfucker lessons from the boondocks asap😂😂
CAN U, SMELLLLLLLLL WHAT TYRESE IS, COOKINGGGG??  A BIGG PEACE OF BLACK SOFT DOGGSHITT!!!
This was almost 4 years ago in 2015 when they were cool. I'm sure he was joking lol
I'm just a little disappointed that it wasn't ended with a if you smell what The Rock is cookin
The Rock is in WWF promo mode right now. Tyrese you not fucking with this lol
Don't fuck with the rock t u not ready.
I ain't even hating or anything but I just hear it right now and I agree with Dwayne😂😂😂
Y'all messy... This is old
Fuck black roses go up my ass
DO YOU SMELL WHAT THE ROCK JUST COOKED? \n\n\n\n\n\nYep its called Tyrese on a platter with a black Rose 😂🤣😂🤣😂 \nTyrese gon leave ppl tf alone.
Where is his beard
Cryrese messing with the Rock's $. He's gonna get his ##Candyass beat. 😂😂 Y'all wrong for putting this OLD video out to be taken out of context.
The only really good song is addict I'll admit but the rest was garbage besides 2 or 3 more songs
Lol. He has a point. I only liked one song.
Lol the Rock gave him the people's mouth lol get his @$$
You can’t disrespect someone from the attitude era bitch ! The great one is still great.
Reminds me of his wrestling days. Don't come for The Rock unless he sends for you! Guess Tyrese just got the smack down! 😂😂😂
The album is typical black homeless crackhead singing 🎤 in a ⛺️
This video is old. Rock was being funny. And was helping Tyrese promote the album. Rock is a lot bigger now. And has a grey beard. Y’all will believe anything.
Smh I like them both but this is really old and he was joking around with tyrese. Rock was filming one of the ff movies as well as filming for the show ballers. It pays to do research y'all. Ppl have to learn to stop burning bridges when your angry with a close buddy.  Idk either one personally but Tyrese went to find this video at great lengths to make it seem like the rock is a horrible guy. Makes you wonder what does this say about Tyrese's character though.
😂😂😂
Tyrese is a cry baby bitch
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯
🔫🔫🔫🔫😂😂😂😂
😂🤣💯
LMAO. I love Dwayne
I love him
😂
SHOOT
Fuck u rock
ooh my
Yah it price of shit
😂😂😂😂😂💀
Just beat his ass rock.  Fuck cryrees. AnD Kevin  hart to i hate that bitch bonus punch please 2 for one slap him back on the bus singing for a Pepsi
Damn lol Tyrese brought out the old school Rock 😂😂😂
Go in ROCK YESSSSS THE OL ROCK BACK
This was a joke. Dwayne was filming FF and Ballers at the same time so he was in character.  Cryrese posted it and was laughing a few years ago, and now he tries to flip it and make it seem like Dwayne did this in to be mean.
Was that a joke or what. I really thought they was finished with the B'S Rock and if don't like the guy why did u listen to the album anyway. SMH grown men
Hee! Hee! I don't know if Rock is joking or what but this was funny.
Dwayne went OFF!
Yall. Live talking to me bitches eats this pussy
Well damn. I bought it last year, got some cute songs but nothing to go crazy over. Aint trash at all.
Everybody know the rock has a beard now lol clearly old when tyrese released black rose witch was last year
Didn't black rose come out a while ago?
This has to be a publicity stunt right? Lol like wtf
😳
I tell u what u fine Ass hunk of a man.   U so sweet u have a Beautiful wife Beautiful daughter and im a fan.   Rock i just got to say Dammmmmmmm.,    I Luv It when u talk dirty.  Thats right respond to this dry lip jealous ass man.  FUCK Tyrese.
Yo this fucker is late as hell.. that album is old news and it's not even that bad.. what is his purpose with this
Is it a problem that I already knew the lyrics to this song by heart this morning when this song wasn't even 12 hours old yet?\n\nPA-PA-PA-PASSION!!!!!!
so so good! love the message :)
THIS IS SO GOOD
Passion debuted at #13 on the New Alternative 40 Chart this week:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzJNg0BqA7A&list=PLxlSBzMcrtkMCVtuXEIz5BXpPfycTwsS5&index=13
Ahhhh AWOLNATION has gone and done it again!! This is insane and worth the wait, I can’t wait to hear what the album is going to sound like after hearing this masterpiece 😍😍
I love that this is kind of a mix of Megalithic Symphony and Run
I remember this dude back in 2006 as the lead singer of UTIOG. Safe to say, he's progressed amazingly
THANK YOU THIS IS AHHHHHHH
I love Awol only band I'll ever preorder on vinyl and know its gonna be great
AWOLNation is back and better than ever!
THIS HAS BEEN STUCK IN MY HEAD FOR 4 DAYS STRAIGHT WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SO GOOD AARON
Amazing!! I can't get this song out of my head now!!!
This is an advertisement for Green Bull, no more Cannabis Hemp Energy Drink, Green Bull is what we need, hhahahahahha.
WOW! I love it!
Holy crap this is good
hey young woman in the curlers, \nsend me your email.\ny'all so fine. \nmust have been fun making/doing that.
I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS. WOW. YES. I NEEDED NEW AWOLNATION MUSIC!!!!!!!!
Love it i wish it would sond better on headphones im sure it sounds good on speakers
Yes! Yes! Yes! God I love AWOLNATION so freaking much!
This song made me really think about myself and how i need more passion, i don't know where or how to get it but to start i will just purchase a case of Passiflora Edulis!!!
Nice To See You Back Awolnation
IT FUCKING NEEDS TO BE IN THE NEED FOR SPEED UNDERGROUND 3!!!
How I can give 1 millions likes for this song?)
When does the new album come out??
The outro is so friggin AWOL.  I love it.  Can't wait to someday see this song performed live!
I like it. Sounds great.
I hope this song gets on the fame and spot on the radio like sail did! I would love to see people appreciate awol more
This was a very pleasant surprise, quite refreshed I'm excited to see more :)
Hated it when I first heard it but the main verse stuck with me and now I love it!!! It's so awolnation!!!
I like the original but it’s really awesome at 1.5x speed!
S/O to the Irontom cameo in this video. ;)
I feel this album will take AWOL to the next level in regards to mainstream, and such. What a great song!
Cannot wait for new album :)
So good. Thanks Red Bull for continuing to give Aaron an outlet to share his musical genius with the world. Can wait to see this live.
Here at 20k!! Absolutely love you guys! Can't wait for the new album to drop! 😭❤👏
I'm glad that awolnation still has the same kind of music and didn't change, unlike other bands (cough cough 30stm)
It sounds like gorillaz and nine inch nails had a baby, i love it
First I heard it, I was skeptical. Then listening to it a few more times, it grew on me, as it says, it blew my mind!!!!! It's fucking awesome!!!!
a great sound, spinnin' it..
Tbh kinda disappointed with this track. Loved their last album. Hope to see this new one top it.
Only here for grace
Glad to have new music
Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind.  Wow what a great song........
pa pa pa passion!
I freaking love love LOVE AWOLNATION and everything they put out
I hope they blow up
I love the new song already <3
I can’t stop listening, what’s happening
So does this mean therre will be a tour???????
When the album red bull
Nice jam.  Keep us the good work guys.
Amazing song.  Can't wait for the new album and tour.
Just googled Awolnation wondering what they up to and discovered this....GREAT!!
Seriously I've been waiting so long for this and this is everything and more I want!!!! I can't wait to see them again live!!! (I need this album like now!!)
Definitely not bad, but why do I have this feeling that any more albums won't be as good as Megalithic Symphony was?
I appreciate them putting Irontom in this
I feel like AWOL is family. Each album has become personally synonymous with a stage of my life. Somehow, these songs make my life feel more optimistic, like there is always something to be looking forward to, even if there isn't anything in particular. I didn't know that music could be so powerful until I started listening to AWOL ten years ago.
Love it! I feel passionate about this song! :) Dying to see them live!
i started CRYING i have been a fan for so long!
I've been waiting a year or so for new music from my favorite band and I was not dissatisfied 😍😍😍😍😍
I have passion about listening to this song everyday.

I teach high school English. We are doing childhood storybook characters for our department’s Halloween costumes. I’d love to see what character you’d choose. I want it to be scary but not too gory, and I also have to talk and move a lot in it. Any ideas from anyone are greatly appreciated!! PS: I’m on a budget. Thank you!
DRINKING GAME! SHOTS EVERY TIME SHE SAYS BEE OR MAKES A BEE PUN.
My 3 year old daughter turned around just as Careless Whisper started playing and burst out laughing saying you are a silly bumblebee, and now she wants to watch all of your videos...I'm going to go with maybe when you're older as an answer.  Just know you have a very young fan.

No more amazing socks? NOOOOOOOOO! *in Claptrap's voice*
I wanna watch this but official lava song is recommended.
Here’s my thought on Lou being so low: Lou is the newest animatic out there with the movie it came before not even on DVD so a lot of people haven’t seen it. Since people haven’t seen it putting it up against another animatic most have seen isn’t exactly fair\n\n\n\n\n\nI also think having far less dialogue is WAY better than the lyrics that run Lava
OH MY GOD I NEED TO SEE THE NEWBORN! MAKE A VLOG!
From what I've heard is that those two volcanos are based on Isreal something or other (Brother Iz is what they call him) and his wife or girlfriend... At least in their looks.
Not the socks!!!! Can't you guys like alternate or sell us more socks???
Lava is exactly like my life except I die alone and there is no happy ending. :,(
Oh God, please don't get into top 10's. Too many of those. Stay original like you always are.
Bound almost came in dead last...?! How?! There is an emotionally supportive Jackalope!
So I watched lava again... Not into it but probably because I can't relate.
Yes Ukulele is pronounced oo-koo-le-le. And uku means lice/flea. Lele means to jump. So jumping flea. Which describes what the Hawaiian people saw when the Portuguese people brought the braguinha and played it for them. Fingers jumping around the fret board like fleas.
I'm sad that Paperman didn't make top 3, it's my personal favorite! I'm also surprised that Get a Horse! wasn't in top 3.
My friend randomly brought a ukulele to school and during lunch she played a beautiful rendition of Lava and everyone stopped to listen.
Aw man, I was expecting you to mention the Mexican volcanoes Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl, they have a legend about an Aztec princess named Iztaccíhuatl that is in love with a handsome warrior named Popocatépetl, and they swore to marry if he came back after winning the war against the Tlaxcalans. But Popocatépetl's love rival overheard this and, jealous, told Iztaccíhuatl that his fiancé had died in battle. Heartbroken by this lie, she died. Some time later, Popocatépetl came back victorious to find out that his future wife had died. He became depressed, and wandered for days until he found a way to honor her death: he piled up 10 mountains to make a grave, took the princess in his arms and gently laid her down on top of the giant mountain, he kissed her, took a torch and kneeled before her to mourn her eternal slumber. They have been together since that day and his heart still beats bright red with the love for his princess.\nI think it's a beautiful story and the Lava short reminded me of it when I first watched it c:
My favourite short is day and night
You talked about your son kicking and I automatically liked the video ❤
Meh. I don't think Lava is that great. Made it even worse when I saw Inside Out. The 2nd worst Disney Pixar movie! 😑
It could have been a turtle from Moana because Olaf will be in front of Coco so a mix of Disney and pixar in the shorts isnt unheard of.
Personally the first time I heard lava I teared up because I was lonely and wanted to meet someone and had given up because of past failures. But then I met someone later in life and now I can hardly remember being alone anymore.
My favorite napkin story is Obi-wan writing his lightsaber plans on a napkin.
Listen, I think it's a really sweet little story. I do. But I can't be the only one that thought lava was a little... lame? \nAh I dunno, not my fave, anyway.
My Favorite short is Boundin'. I do not have a Lava story to share (but I love that short). Tournament ideas: Best Pixar movie, best Harry Potter movie/book, thins in the star wars prequels that sucks the least, best Disney song, and coolest movie character of all time.
It's pronounced Ookalaylee but it's been Americanized into Yukalaylee. So yeah, you're right to think you're pronouncing it wrong. also pronouncing ukulele in the proper way sounds like a pretty cool battle cry.
Can’t the turtles be kuru’s (from find Nemo’s) sons (or random kid-IDK)
Love super Carlin bros but every time I hear about the stupid kid I dislike the video
Honestly I'm not really a fan of lava. Idk why. Its just.... Not my favorite
Aren't they also based on a real island?\nLike, the shot of them together at the end always struck me that it must be based on a real place, probably a volcano called The Lovers or something.\nNo? Just Me? Anyone?
Ukulele is basically Hawaiian for dancing fleas. Because the first people to play them had fingers that moved so fast that they looked like, well whatever dancing fleas look like.
i dont have a lava story sadly i wish i did tho
Awww can’t wait to hear more about your unborn son
Why haven't I watched SuperCarlinBrothers in so long? I need to kick myself...
What about the one with the old man anx chest
OMG I DIDNT KNOW YOU GUYS WERE HAVING A BABY CONGRATS MY FRIEND!! ❤❤❤
When u said u had a very sad announcement I thought u were quitting Super Carlin Brothers or like stopping for a little bit so u could spend time with ur wife and soon to be son
OMG UR GOING TO BE A DAD!!! I’m so happy for you J!
What place did day and night come?
I know Feast isn't technically a Pixar Short but you should talk about it!
It it brings me to tears. The love and wanting to be loved hit me personally. It was how I felt until I found myLele
The two volcanoes remind me of my grandparents. they got married when she was 18 and he was 21, and were together for over 60 years until she passed.
The little match girl 😭
LOL! I always have a real hoot watching your videos, though I havn't seen any in a bit, of course anything titled after LAVA would catch my attention! XD \nI Absolutely Love LAVA! I cried the first time I seen it in theaters, and then when I eventually showed it to my boyfriend (now husband), he cried too! XD so darn cewt dem volcanoes!\nAnyways we love singing it all the time, and then earlier this year when we found out we were pregnant, we knew our nursery theme INSTANTLY! Hawaiian Ocean. --But not just that! That mostly includes LAVA, Lilo & Stitch, and a little bit of Finding nemo.\nOf course we are going pretty far with a sea turtle theme now, but I am obsessed with wanting a huge picture of UKU & LELE over where the crib will be (SQUEE!) Of course I am working on that myself! But it will be so cute having those volcanoes sweetly watching over the baby!\n\nlol we are no where near even starting (nevermind completing) the baby room, but That is just my spiel on how much we loved LAVA too!!!  (Plus Uku reminds me a lot of my husband, who is a giant cuddly ball of mush XD  )
My Lava story: 1 days after meeting a, we were hanging out doing homework together outside. On my iPod, Lava began playing and I sung the chorus to which I heard another voice join me and sing the verses.He was singing with me. When it finished we both were amazed somebody knew and loved the song and it is one of the things which bought us closer together. We have been dating over 1 year now and it is one of our songs we sing together and listen to when we miss each other <3
None of these reasons are why it was the favourite.The video was pretty yet sad and the song was the sameThe end.
Bro, lava is boss. Ukuleles. Where's my bois at?
Commenting before watching because I agree with this title
Geri's game still is and I think always will be my favourite Pixar Short it was probably the first 1 I ever saw and has ALWAYS been stuck in my mind
You should do a video on how Lava in connected to Moana. If it is at all contented
This one is my favorite too.
you should do a pixar movie tournament.
Nooo.....Partly Cloudy is the best one!
why did you stop the socks??????so sad
Who else thought he meant last video forever!
We sang this song in my choir class
Just started watching your videos and love you guys
11 minute explanation on why a 4 minute video is the best short.
my favorite one is the one with the sheep
do like if inside out have a series
me and my partner went to see Inside Out in the cinema when we were on holiday, and even though we were the only adults there without kids I was without a doubt the first person in that screen to cry. SO MUCH! at Lava 😭 happy tears though ❤
I would have picked lift
I love boundin its so cool
Enjoy Your Favorite Song >> http://bit.ly/FuLLmusIc << (FREE)
It's ook-oo-lay-lay\nNot yuke-a-laylay\n\nThere's a reason their names are pronounced that way, J.
Okay guys pleeeaase don't all shout at me but I actually didn't like Lava.. Sorry!
I lava this short film.
Sorry, but the number one reason, and perhaps the only reason necessary....IT'S A PUN!!! Puns are the best!
Omg I used to watch these in school- never realised they were pixar!!!
Lava is the best but piper is the cutest
#ripsocks
#supercarlinbaby
Omg you have a son, congratulations
Anyone heard of Walk On’s?

I wonder why he didn't comment? Maybe he just wanted to focus on why he was there. Hey just realised that is Harvey Weinstein! He has his own shit to deal with right now.

See although I loved the OT12 era with EXO, my boi Kris chose the wrong company, he obviously loves Hiphop, he should've gotten into YG.
Had no idea his English was so good
Ugh now I need a China-line collab. Know it ain't possible. But I hope one day in the future.

BEST PRANK EVER
😂
What shade highlight did he use
The highlighter sticks are very firm and you need to use your finger to pat it on and then blend out with a soft brush.
Now this is what I call a big fuck off wing wow
Daaaaaaaaamn.  Come through, sister. 🙌💞
DO a FauxFilter foundation review Michael!!!
the name is not kilowatt jeezzz
When you called the highlighter kilowatt 😂😂😂😂 they’re all called that 💀
im not gonna lie your intro is better than james charles
I LOVE THIS MAKEUP LOOK & THESE ARE THE BEST WINGS EVER. INLOVE
Fuck me you were loud at 3:18am 😂 shit hun nearly woke my whole household up NOT A PROBLEM BINDI
That contour stick color looked like baby shit though 😂
Bindi I'm shooketh it wasn't better than dick mascara!
Your video of you reacting to old photos was so funny please do another !!!!
i fucking love this eye look, rock on
You’re so laid back in this video! None of your usual slag. What’s going on!? This is a problem. q.
Maybe try blending the contour creme with the fenty beauty blender?? I have heard it's really good!!! Love you Michael!!
I love his looks but how can he be the only one that has problems with stuf no one else has
Your reaction to the highlighter was literally me when I tried it 😂 \n\nalso what shade is the foundation? I didn’t catch it but I’m pale af so it’d probably suit me haha
Love the eyessss❤️❤️❤️and also what is the best lash glue that won't let your falses come off because I'm finding it difficult to find the best lash glue I tried everywhere😭
Have to shake the foundation well first!! Huge difference when you shake it before use
Michael you are so amazing to watch I absolutely love the looks you come up with. Keep slaying it sister your beautiful
Holy actual shit I'm actually in love with yours WHAT AHHH THIS LOOK IS AMAAAAAAAZIN qqq
did he get a nose job , looks fabulous
I was watching full monty before I watched this omg that's so weird 😂❤️❤️
oh my gosh I love you but I cannot stop laughing at how like this Foundation is! bahahahaha
Rewatching this so I don’t know if I commented already but this look is STUNNING q 😍😍
My house wifi is broken and i decided that you are the only one worth sacrificing my mobile internet 🙈❤️
The best face make up you've ever done. First I was like omg this foundation colour tho😂😂 but in the end it looked better than ever! Like literally soo beautiful 😍😍😍loved this combo (contour,Highlighting )
is it a drag makeup look ?
Love this look. No nails are missing this time and btw they are qqqqqqqq CYA!!!!!!!!!!!! XXXXX love you babes. Put this on your story omg ahah xxx
Does the maybelline fit me loose powder have flash back????
This is gorgeous!! For a video recommendation could u please do a natural warm toned everyday makeup look, just very natural and cute :3
Lol you look like literal  ghost but love this eye look and you. Hopefully I can come to your masterclass
Michael have you tried Sportsgirl's eyeshadow palettes? I bought 4 of them and they're amazing! I think you should do a review of them, especially the Pretty as a Peach one and Burgundy one
IN LOVE W THIS LOOK
I really wonder how talented youtubers such as yourself don't have a million subscribers. Q 💜
Worth creature talk ywwbm chamber governor village supply gold card embrace.
You look like Ursula from The Little Mermaid
okay so imma need some rock on merch on the website as soon as possible 💁🏼💁🏼💕
Thank you for helping me lose weight. The moment I saw your face I realized you are mentally ill and I puked my lunch.\nStop it. Get some help.
If you don't want that unicorn shimmer stick I'll take it off your hands NOTAPROBLEM 🙋‍♀️🙌
Too much foundation, that’s why the contour stick ain’t blending
Love you so much Michael QQQQ I hope I can meet you one day 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
I love you Micheal but please calm down with the lip injections, they look so uneven and balloon-like
I want the palette but I don't support mac because they test on animals! First world problems. Sooooooo pigmented
Have you lost your right earring ?
Complaining about the contour stick when you're sponge is still covered in the foundation. Of course it's gonna look like that
I don't understand how you can put makeup on every day for a living and still end up looking pale with ridiculous eyes or massively orange.?
Finally an honest review of Fenty beauty.
OMG your makeup is so nice you look amazing year girl xxx
Love how you say rock on, just how Monique does <3
anyone else have to turn down vol for michaels intro music hahahah
I love how Aussie you speak! ♥️🐨
Am i the only one who actually liked the eye makeup look as a whole? I thought it made his eyes pop 😍😄
You over exaggerated just a little with the unicorn highlight stick 😂 it is honestly not that bad when applying it on customers it's best used when warming the actual product on the back of your hand and patting onto the skin instead of just wiping it onto the skin which will lift whatever is underneath it
Legit, if your ever having a bad day you, just need a little Michael fix!! You make me laugh dal 😘
Great come back Ginger Jim! No I'm married with 2 babies thanks hun for the kind words!!! Your an idiot problem some lonely loser trolling people and cutting them down!!! And after this I'm not adding fuel to the fire it's clearly you can tell you have NO RESPECT FOR THE WAY PEOPLE ARE!!!!!
that foundation was way too light which made the outcome not so great..
You slayed
u better slay James Charles
Ily Michael I love u so oii ooooooooo much plz come to Perth ily
They do have concealed tho...

Dude did you do your research on Fenty beauty and how to use the products? All her powder highlighter are called Killawatt. The duos have the shade names on the bottom & on the box it comes in. This was a half ass  review.

I love everything he sings my #1 favorite...
I fuck with his music hard 🔥
Made me cry😭 Not sure if I'm crying coz they super cute and so happy or coz I'm a bit jealous.\nIf anyone tries to break them up they'll have to deal with me❤❤ they so cute man.
I love this song to death

Love this song 😍😍i want this 😭
Kane brown I love you my name is landon

This is such a beautiful song and video. You can just see the happiness on their faces , love it
ANITTA IS IN #12 USA with the Song IS THAT FOR ME(ALESSO FEAT.ANITTA)!UP!!!
🎶What's Mine Is Yours 🎶.\n\nLovely song \nKane Brown is so talented 😊.
I know every time song of his
Must admit, if just one person reads this it will make my day. I'm a music artist from Azerbaijan (I guess you even don't know where this country is). I do know that folks always make these comments, but I believe that I will be the one you'll be excited you decided to listen to. If ONE PERSON could just give this a thumbs up, you will be a great step closer to helping a person's dreams come true. I swear that I don't suck and you won't be disappointed. I Just need one chance and 3 minutes.
So beautiful i love his music
Geez stop stealing me and grayson’s thing🙄
Another brilliant song never seems to dissapoint
Well I love it.  Kane Brown is a new person to me.  Love his style and his music.  Hope he goes far and stays popular for years to come.  This song is just wonderful.
SO GAY! lol jk congrats!
50... *TRENDING* WOOAHHHH now gonna watch bill bye feminist guy
Nigga is overrated
Yous a pussy an a trick
Pretty gay tbh
Is anyone else having trouble with the HD?
Why am i here
Is it wrong that as soon as I saw VEVO in the thumbnail I thought it was another diss track?
This little faggot needs to be raped
That smile. That blink of your eyes that made me change my ways. You freed this man from all his rusted chains and changed everything I ever knew. You blew away all the walls I  could ever place before your feet. You took this heart I buried 6ft deep from all to see and made it believe it's fine to be alive and thrive in the light of the day that you gave me. You saved me, and for that what's mine is yours...
i thought it will be communism song by the title
So is so stupid and boring from a kid
i hate fukin country its like IM A COWBOY
it’s good but too much like eminem
I was hoping this would be that one song from All Dogs Go To Heaven...
What kinda gay ass shit is this kane, common bro.
THE ONLY KANE I WANNA HEAR IS BIG DADDY KANE MOTHAFUCKA!
Gonna be honest- only reason I clicked was bcuz I thought I said Kanye West...
He looks female and male at the same time.....
more country trash on trending, proves trending is trash
I love your new song and I hadn't fiancee liten to it we both noticed your love story and ours have a lot of simularity if you Dont mind I'd love to play it at our wedding . and thank you I love your music ...😄
got that shakira nasal sound..nice....urrhhnnnaa
Who shoots on VHS anymore?
White woman love a half nigger. Disgrace to your own race
The chorus tune is copied from If I die Young by the band perry and also Eminem
Personally, I'm quite partial to the B line.
Recently, one of my favourite songs has been What about by Janet Jackson, all thanks to you
I always feel guilty if I don't buy one of the products a sales lady recommends me, but I always do the I'll think about it deal and run away.
Where are you? Miss your videos. :-(
My favourite trainline is waikanae to wellington but that's in nz so you'll have no idea 😊 my favourite author is robin hobb 100000/10 recommend if you're into fantasy
my favourite train line would be the one that goes from London to Brighton that's such a nice one the worst is great western railway fuck them
AHHH omg my new best one is the film Pan's Labyrinth. Watched it for the first time today with school for film studies A level. I have never seen a film so aesthetically wonderful whilst also so technically brilliant and narratively stunning. I personally connected with it a great deal so that helped a lot-I was in tears most of the time. I adore the fantasy aspect and the historical setting but also love the darkness of it and how it is not just a (disturbing) fairytale but also the relation of that with the context of the Spanish rebels fighting the facist group after the civil war. That description was a mess. But I just really had a lot of feelings about the film.
Came back from Amsterdam today and although not a train line, it was the bus line that our driver lovingly called the “cocaine express”. One hell of a ride.
I like London Midland, free WiFi unlike Virgin.
I do love the DLR
I think the bakerloo line is underrated
The jubilee line is my fave tube line and Japan is my favourite country ever now having visited
Try the Gentleman's Bastards series by Scott Lynch. Basically Oceans Eleven meets Assassin's Creed. Warning the series is still ongoing, only 3 books out. But its so amazing. The way he writes is basically like he's painting movie scenes and dialogue is hilarious :D
I like the Inheritance series by Christopher Paolini. Extra info about it, it was originally intended to be a trilogy, but the world got so complex, along with  the characters, that it broke that oppressive system and became a four-parter. Mandatory reading for all humans who like fun and don't know everything. I love train line 2, in my city. It's the older one, and has far more interesting people on it.
Metropolitan because if you get the right train you skip some bits and get where you want to go much quicker! ;P
my favourite train line is the go transit lakeshore west line which means nothing to people that do not live in southern ontario but it is a good train trip 10/10. my favourite books include but are not limited to the night circus by erin morgenstern, she is not invisible by marcus sedgwick, and the rest of us just live here by patrick ness
I read All That She Can See by good ol carrie hope fletcher, absolutely loved it! Rewatched Black Mirror ultimate favourite and favourite film i've watched recently is probably Moana (i watched it again i love it so much). A favourite train line in wales cannot exist because Arriva are shockingly bad you wouldnt believe. I've been on the london underground once and literally can't remember any names so who knows
favourite train line is edinburgh to london kings cross, because whenever im coming to london its for something exciting - an interview, a visa appointment, a reunion with friends - london itself im not that fussed about but that train journey means im going to something not somewhere.
The Lobster is very much the same, perhaps darker, but I haven't seen the new film yet. Thanks for the vid, Dan! Oh also, the line from Providence to S. Station, Boston 😊
I recommend La Vita É Bella, if you haven't seen it, it is one of the most beautiful films in the whole entire world with comedy cleverly spread throughout... another good film is Hunt For The Wilder People, it's hilarious and you will be quoting it forever 😸
on the train to edinburgh, near the scottish border the train goes right next to the see and it always just fills me with a bit of warmth inside
Favs\nGreat British Bake Off\nEducating Greater Manchester \nRed Queen series
I have too many favorite books, but only one favorite train line. Portland Oregon Tri-Met Max Red Line.
Over summer, I went inter railing with friends. We were travelling between Vienna and Venice overnight, on a thirteen hour journey. There were three of us, along with two strangers, packed into a small cabin with three seats lining each wall. About half an hour into the journey, we discovered that each of the seats could be made to fully recline- in essence, the bum bit of the seat slid forward to allow the back bit of the seat to slide down and become horizontal. We did this with each of the seats, essentially converting the cabin into a great big mattress, the five of us lying parallel to one another trying to get some sleep.\n\nIt didn't work. I was really uncomfortable, and around 1 in the morning decided that enough was enough. I left the cabin and went and sat in the connecting bit between two carriages for a couple of hours, listening to music. Eventually, I felt just exhausted enough to maybe catch some shut eye. I snuck back to the cabin/bed, climbed over my friends, and tried to lie still, waiting for sleep to come.\n\nI managed maybe an hour of sleep, maybe a bit more. I zoned in and out of consciousness, noticing street lights dashing by in valleys far below us, and deducing that there must be so much Austrian countryside we were missing out on in the night. Sleep came and went for another couple of hours, until I came too and noticed that we were in daylight. I sat up, rubbed my eyes, and looked out of the window. My gasp was loud enough to waken the cabin.\n\nWe were in the middle of a mountain range as the sun rose, and the view was unlike anything I've ever seen. It was the most spectacular assortment of mountains and trees and snow and sun. It was the type of moment you imagine in your head, an unachievable fantasy that could never actually pan out. Like a moment in a John Green novel. An instant of pure beauty. And it was real, it was tangible. I could pull the emergency stop cord and run out and be in that view (I didn't). It was one of the most magical moments I can ever remember experiencing.\n\nThat's my favourite train line.
I could honestly watch your videos all day, your voice literally soothes me and your dry sense of humour really brightens me up, thankyou so much for being such a natural creator
Ooh I like participating\n\nI haven't seen it yet but I can tell Professor Marston and the Wonder Women is soon to be a favorite. And I've been listening to The Regrettes for the past couple weeks and they're incredible and I'd highly recommend if you want some good riot grrl punk fun
I have the same mask from The Body Shop and its wonderful
Okay so most importantly, I live in Perth and my favourite train line is the Fremantle Line, also known as the Blue Line so... that's fun.\n\nFavourite movie is 'Breakfast at Tiffanies' and if you have seen the film I recommend the book, get ready for a wild ride. I personally like the movie more, you'll see why. \n\nFavourite book is trickier because it depends on mood. If you want a good YA novel I recommend 'Six of Crows' and it's sequel 'Crooked Kingdom' by Leigh Bardugo. It's a heist novel but also not a heist novel... yeah. If you want just... fantastic, 'American Gods' by Neil Gaiman (I've only read the extended edition) it's brilliant. \n\nI liked this video a lot. :)
One that had me in tears was Flight by Sherman Alexie, who's a quality author btw
i’ve been jamming nonstop to the new ballparkmusic song ’exactly how you are’ it’s so nice and it makes me feel nice
Honestly, all I've really read this year are books related to Star Wars. Would highly recommend Lost Stars by Claudia Gray.
Has to be the Transpenine express
My favourite train line is the dlr because it has the least amount of sweat in the air, and also has near to no security, so when I'm broke I can just...jump my way in... >.<
the one that goes from Lichfield to London cuz its cheap as fuck buts its like the ryanair of trains and normally you have to sit on the floor or by the shitters so thats fun but it goes to euston which is better than all the other pretentious and expensive train stations in the middle of bumfuck in London -cough- st pancras
My favorite book at the moment is ‘walking the underground overground’ which u recommend ages ago. I really enjoyed reading it and learning so much. The book doesn’t just tell you facts about the tube lines and its stations but also gives you a new perspective on how to view London and it’s hidden treasures. Living in Australia I have had the lucky opportunity to visit London and I wish I had read this book before I visited. Because instead of taking the underground to the places I wanted to visit I wish I walked around the city more and see these diamonds in the ruff. I loved London and I hope to go back one day and visit some of the places mentioned in the book. I also highly recommend the book to anyone!!!
I'm so jealous of the uk/America.... everybody is complaining about summer ending and winter starting. I'm sad because I can't remember a single day that it rained this winter. I want winter back I'm moving to the UK for 6 months
Blade Runner 2049, First sequel i've ever seen as good if not better than the First, fallout series, i love video games i love sci fi and post apocalipse YouTube, it's been a lovely few months, october i love cold months i can't stand heat. Andddd movies in general as always
My best ones this month have been The Book Thief and Rick and Morty...quite opposite tones. Says a lot about my brain atm.
my favourite train line by far is the line from bristol temple meads to reading. sometimes late but a good solid relaxing journey, often not too busy despite being over an hour, some pretty countryside to look at. 8/10\n\n\n\n\nalso wth are you doing with a hillary book dan. ew
My favourite train line is the central line, super continent to get from my house into central London. Highly recommended 8/8, 6 stars, 100% reliable
Oh my god! I didn't understand that you said 'colder months' i thought you were talking about some Game of Thrones thing called coldemonts 😂😂😂
I've seen Blade Runner 2049 at the movies the other day and it was mind blowing. I am so affected by it... IT'S SO GOOD
My favourite train line is the steam train that runs between the coastal village of Swanage and the even smaller, cobblier village of Corfe (which has an awesome castle next to it). It's all very picturesque and lovely there. Thank you for asking.
You asked for it, so here goes - my favorite train line is the regional train from Leipzig to Chemnitz (both in Germany).
Did you say favourite train line? Because in all seriousness, there's a line known as the Heart of Wales line which goes between Cardiff and Holyhead, but the only bit I've been on is (ironically) the English bit from Hereford to Shrewsbury, and it's got some darn lovely views.
I'm really enjoying bus 12 at the moment, it goes from Utrecht central station to the university and it's so so so crowded. Almost everyone hates it but I think it's so amazing, you see the most interesting people, you hear the most crazy stories and I sometimes make friends for like ten minutes and then never see them again
As I've just started my gap year of doing odd jobs and figuring out what I wanna do with life (lol) I've started compiling lists of books and films I should read and see. Top of my books list are gone girl, the handmaid's tale and the bluest eye, although I recently bought Rest In Power (a book written by Trayvon Martin's parents about his life and death) which I'm quite eager to read. I finally watched Arrival the other day an loved it and am meaning to watch Hacksaw Ridge and all Star Wars because I haven't actually watched any of them all the way through (Ik I'm sorry). Also got a tv show list and next up is Westworld...This is a real long comment I hope someone actually finds it interesting lol
I don’t have a favourite trainline... now I want one
My current favorite thing to watch (besides you and josh giving me almost daily content) is drunk disney by practical folks! It's really fun and light hearted and I'm just really enjoying the easiness of it
Favourite thing at the moment is King Arthur. That movie was incredible; I was thinking about it for days after seeing at the cinemas and once I'm done planning the blocking for the play I'm directing (send help, please) I'm going to reward myself by getting it on dvd.\nFavourite train line is the airport line (usually not going to the airport when I use it though - usually going to concerts at the Opera House!). Much nicer than the train line that's actually the closest to my house.
I LOVE that mask! Wish I could use the others but I'm allergic :( instead I use Lush masks instead
If you're a hygge fan 100% come to Denmark - I thought the whole hygge craze in the UK was just capitalism capitalising on some random concept that doesn't really exist but Danish people LOVE hygge and are always trying to make situations more hygge. For example, in the University of Copenhagen Library there are free blankets you can borrow to wrap yourself in while you do your work! It's the best, Denmark is a cool place.
House Of Cards mate. That is the current favourite. What a show. Also What Happened was great, but made me extremely angry and upset all over again. I JUST WANTED HER TO WIN OKAY (still not over it)...
If you haven't seen/read it I would recommend The Handmaids Tale in both book and TV form
My favourite train line is the Joondalup line but that would mean nothing to you haha A really good book I read recently is The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead.
bakerloo line forever. also i'm reading The Power by Naomi Alderman and thoroughly enjoying it
Tube line? The Victoria or the overground \n\nIf you’re not talking about London, I like the sky train in Vancouver... but I’m a bit biased. ;)
My favourite train line is the Kapiti line from Wellington Station to Waikanae
my favorite train line is either the Corona or Hargita Lines that go between Budapest and Brasov, passing through the best pockets of Transylvania and Székelyföld.
Dan, I'm sure that soup is delicious and I myself and psyched for soup season.. but frankly, and I'm sorry, it looks like you're eating a bowl of shit
can you please talk about what happened  when youve finished it?
right now it’s my summer doona as i’m in australia. haven’t been out of bed for a few months because depression but i love this doona.
my alltime favourite book is I'll Give You the Sun by Jandy Nelson and its INCREDIBLE. ive read it three times and marked my copy to hell and back. cannot recommend it enough
Eyy! I made potato and cheese soup today because it got cold enough :D I'm quite the opposite, I enjoy the cooler weather much more than the warmer months. I like the warmth, but only for a short time. I don't like being hot and sweaty :/ I like cozying up with a blanket, a book, a cup of tea or coffee, and a pet (preferably a cat). I can't wait for snow and more baking and cooking!
are you sure winter is coming?  i'm not.  you prefer the summer months?  april thru october possibly thru november possibly thru december possibly forever.  damn what ISN'T a summer month at this point?  come here, you'll have a blast at least until ya get heatstroke in the deep south united states.  this place will cook you like roast chicken.
Can't believe you didn't ask about favorite soup! After that whole intro! I'll tell you anyway. I made a delightful cauliflower green curry soup last night that was very much in the spirit of hygge.
I'm a pretty big fan of the Gold Coast line
I'm rereading The Martian cos it's so heckin good. also rewatching stranger things. I should probably try to consume new entertainment but. The Martian. so heckin good.
Does anyone else constantly want to run their fingers thru Daniel’s hair?
Isn't hillary extremely corrupt? She constantly changes her stances e.g. gay marriage just to win votes, she's known to be in the pockets of big powerful companies?
My favourite book and movie haven't changed since I was 10 (which is Harry Potter and Nightmare Before Christmas respectively). Don't know what that says about me as a person considering at age 24 my favourite things are still the same as they were when I was 10 :/
I don't put it on my beardy bit oh Daniel, you wonderful human!
When you're taking a break from studying Brecht and Mother Courage, to watch a Daniel J vid where he references BRECHT
Daniels videos always make me feel so calm and welcome and warm...omg his videos are the soup of youtube vids!
I like steam engines not because of the pollution but because of the industrial revolution occurring and inspiring creativity
if you haven't already: HIdden Figures.
love the northern line.
Well the Milton line, I guess. not that Go ever gives it good service.
i like london midland bc their trains are clean and well spaced out and USUALLY not too busy. also enjoying my bedding i got for uni from matalan (its sO soft) and this charcoal and bamboo face wash by t-zone (really cheap and good for oily skin, if you're a student buy it in superdrug bc they do student discount if you have unidays)
I love a good Jubilee line ngl
Genuinely spent a few minutes wondering what my favourite train line is .... tbh Hull Trains going anywhere wins because hometown pride and that
Current favorite train line: Northern, because it was basically the main one I have used this past month (ie: the only month I have ever been in London).
now i really want some tortilla soup
Slow Magic just released a new album and quite frankly *I'M OBSESSED*
my favourite book is the outsiders by s.e. hinton , and no I will not capitalize
I rewatched Spider-man:Homecoming the other day and I had forgotten how much I love this film!
Me: what are caldamons, is that something from Game of Thrones that I forgot about? ...  Oh, wait. caldamons, warmer months, colder months, warmer months....
My favorite ones...AVATAR the last airbender because I've been binging it again and it's glorious and I've made peach cobbler, pecan cookies, and apple muffins this week. My kitchen is well stocked and I got promoted yesterday. There's a crap ton of wildfires that's making the air awful and scary (I live in Northern CA right where the fires are happening) but a lovely breeze came this afternoon and swept it all away. LIFE IS GOOD. Food is amazing. Dan Howell uploaded a fantastic video today. What more could a girl want
~Things I Live For~
Awww Daniel! Where you be?
i like trains
Today: Rain. Recently: Vietnamese style rice paper rolls.
my favourite youtuber... is DANIEL J LAYTON! awww. *cough*putmeonthemailinglist*cough*
Dan: Whats your favourite trianline\nMe: not southern
Favorite soup: my moms potato leek soup
My favourite movie is def Stardust.
Eastmidlandstrains reppin 👌
Bakerloo, mate, every time
Favourite movie - Pride (2014) soooo good
I genuinely thought you very nonchalantly said the soup was 'carrot, *human*, and kidney bean' and got very confused

How do these guys eat all of this food I barley have room in my tummy
STEVEN KEPT THE SUIT FROM THE SUITS EPISODE? WHAT! It was way too expensive for brunch brah.
Is this filmed in L.A.?
are Breakfast tacos just liike a texas thing? cuz they are like a must have here, and when i went to louisiana i asked someone if they have breakfast tacos and they looked at me as if i was speaking korean to them....
They look fancyyyy at the buffet!
Im super hungry right now i didnt eat Breakfast But today I will eat My brunch
Thumbs up for finally really going for it when feeding Adam!
Do an episode where the camera man takes control instead of you two
The worst part about watching this is that.. It's 11:27 in the morning and I still did not have *Brunch* yet.. And my stomach is growling.
I've watched a lot of these and the white guy is CLEARLY so uncomfortable with Steven being affectionate.
 if you don't like your family you can always drink al little bit more  ...............WHAT 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You guys should do a worth it episode on queso dip
TACOS ARE NOT GOD DAM TACOS IF THEY DONT HAVE CILANTRO MEAT SALSA ROJA OR VERDE AND CORN TORTILLAS
These guys are getting paid to eat great food while 5 million of us watch
Adam is the backbone of this show
Have these people never had a breakfast burrito? Adding a Tortilla to breakfast food is nothing new
I like it when they become so best friends
I like to see how they are bonding more tho :p
My favorite part is the guy that eats so quietly 😂
Does anyone else realize how far Andrew shoves the fork in his mouth? No? Ok.
Why didn’t they do this while they were in Melbourne....
What if you mix all food courses together?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbruncher
That chuckle at 10:21 really scared me for a moment. @Buzzfeed it's not Halloween yet.
lol in russia and the balkans u eat this for lunch :3 (sometimes breakfast)
I love how they never forget Adam

I don’t like breakfast. But brunch? Godlike.
my favorite thing ever was Adam getting his own  pancake pizza ❤
How do i apply for a job like this? Serious inquiry
I would be so interested in a VEGAN episode. Would love to know what other countries have to offer and what expensive vegan food looks & tastes like ^-^
Why do these guys get gayer and gayer over time?!?!?
6:42 Make this into a Buzzfeed Debatable video. STAT.
Steven is weird he always bites into the same spot andrew bit into
Please do a video on 'Water'
BRUCH FACT: Steven has to pee, so much
Brunch is for people without kids.
The guys voice on the last brunch was sooooooooooo deep
is adam really that quiet off camera?
I just wanted to know if anyone knows this but who is the person who says the ending of every tasty video?
2 minutes into the video and he's already comparing the food to babies LMAO!
Adam is the best !!!! Show this to Adam pls !!!
You should make an episode about cotton candy :))))

Adam's bite of cake was amazing, he ate half the thing in 1 bite!
Steven looks good in that suit, the one from suit episode
Do an episode with pancakes
Go to Oahu, go to Boots n Kimos, get the banana mac nut pancake. Thank me later.
If you listen closely, that guy from the last restaurant sound just like Vince Vaughn.
When it gets awkward, eat more lmfao
and when it gets awkward you can just eat more is how i live my life tbh
Stevens face at the 13:04 is priceless. 😂😂
Adam is getting his own food - YES :D \nFinally.
Andrew is such a Tsundere...
Do a Yumcha food adventure please!!! It'll be interesting.
Make a lazanya one too 😆😆😆
Go to Australia, a shrimp like the one you showed the camera, would be small over there. No kidding.
Adam is the best!
Wait are breakfast tacos not a big thing out of Texas? Because like I know I can go to almost any place that serves breakfast and order a breakfast taco and it at least be decent.
Big Bite from Adam @ 13:54

So vegetarian= egg whites?
Try $3 blowjob vs $200 blowjob
Yea i love them
When I was around 13, the meaning of food suddenly and rapidly changed. I realized that I didn't look like every other girl and the idea hasn't really ever left my mind. I am not comfortable with people commenting on anything that I eat, I eat emotionally and when I'm not hungry. I prefer to eat by myself, and when I am around other people I'm very aware about how much everyone else is eating compared to me and if anyone says anything at all about my food that could be seen as negative, I lose my appetite and don't want to eat anymore. I struggle everyday with my feelings towards food, but hearing people talk about how they got over their issues with food helps me a little in trying to fix whats going on inside my head.
I admire you so much....i am 69, and been vegan for 9 months and have lost 47 pounds.  I wish i had figured out some of these things when i was your age.  You rock!
I'm so happy you made this video. I've always been chubby and struggled with food and my weight. Videos like this make me feel less alone. 💜
I can relate to this very well.  I was 7 when my grandfather started making advances towards me.  My parents were divorced, my dad mia and mother was in the navy.  I turned to food to cope with what I was going through.  I turned 18 and found out I had PCOS, a genetic disorder that makes it difficult to loose weight due to imbalanced hormones.  My relationship with food has been a constant war every day for 22 years.  I was anorexic, bulimic and obsessive compulsive with food.  It has been the longest  battle in my life.  Some days it feels all consuming.  I tried going vegan but found it triggered my ocd.  Thank you for sharing your story,  it's always heartwarming to hear similar stories from the other side.
Please be honest to yourself, If you have Cats and Dogs they still need food with meat and if you take or ever need any Medical procedure or medicine they also exist due to a lot of animal tests and pain, so you CAN'T disconnect as you think. Don't fool yourself. You not helping animals being a hypocritical human.
You are so inspiring Kiera, I love watching you videos 💖
You have shown us all that it is still very difficult. You say that you didn't want to talk about food on your channel but it really is one of the reason why all of us are here, we listen to you and look up to you, you are beautiful inside and out and you have inspired me to be better and helped me become Vegan. Please keep going and continue with this channel and talk about yourself and food, its brilliant! You're brilliant!
I can really relate to you. From the year or so I've been watching your channel I would have assumed that you'd always been thin. I think you're beautiful and intelligent... even more so now that I see how alike we are.
Great to hear your story <3 I'm sure a lot can relate somehow to what you've told us now, I know I can. You should feel proud of yourself, you've done an amazing job
Hey try this before they are all gone! I had AMAZING success losing weight with garcinia extract. It burns fat, gives you energy and stops you from being hungry all the time. Well today is the last day they are giving away trial bottles. Grab one while you can before they are all gone here: http://www.getyourdeal.club/free/1DayGarciniaOffer
Hey Keira ❤️ thank you so much for this video - it hit home a lot for me as I've also struggled in the past (and I continue to even now)! About your What I Eat videos... please don't listen to the negative comments. These videos actually really helped me with my journey towards veganism because I saw how realistic your diet was. It was nothing too fancy, nothing expensive... I remember watching once of your videos where you do a vegan Tesco shop and I remember thinking wow actually it looks really easy to be vegan! You just buy more vegetables!. So yeah, it made the vegan diet seem much more do-able for me and is probably one of the bigger things that helped me push forwards in the right direction with my diet/morals :) I'm super glad you are feeling better about everything and I hope you continue to feel better every day :)
What a brave thing for you to do. I really appreciate your honesty and I'm so happy to hear you're feeling so much better. My ED has the tightest hold over me. It's videos like this one that give me hope that one day, I too can be happy within. Thank You so much. Xxx
I related to this so much. Thank you for making this video 💖
Eurgh I love you. Thank you so much for you being you!! 🍄
I found a lot more things that I would eat at others peoples houses too!
Going vegetarian has made me be way less of a picky eater. I am way more willing to try new foods.
thank you for this video keira, you're the best!!
Veganism changed my relationship with food too! And I'm so grateful to you for recommending the minimalist Baker as I can finally cook 😂. After hating exercise my entire life I have now joined a kickboxing gym and the impact it has had on my mental health is amazing. I feel the best I've ever felt, a workout works better than any anti depressant I've ever taken and I can't believe it!
I would have never known this side to you💭 thanks for sharing🙂 You are definitely one of the reasons why I started thinking more about vegan choices/ meals, and why I one day want to transition completely into that eating lifestyle !x
I really struggle trying to be Vegan and working full time 😔😔
Can I just say you are look absolutely stunning!!!! Thank you so much for this video. I’ve been struggling with food and my since I had my son 9 months ago, I’m vegetarian but because I’m so busy with my son and work I find it easier to just eat crap like a bag of crisps. But your video has inspired me to eat more fruit and vegetables and home cooked meals.
Aw Kiera! Thank you so much for sharing your story. Though you and I had different journeys (duhhhh different people), I feel exactly the same about veganism. It was like as soon as I started eating vegan, all the other problems I had went away. I stopped wanting to be thinner, restricting, calorie counting and just eat whatever I want, when I want. Everyone’s always saying how good I look physically, though I do regularly exercise now too. If you want any tips on how to get the ball rolling on exercising on the reg pls let me know. Sending love to you and Alex xx
Nothing better, or healthier, than a delicious, juicy sirloin steak from a 7 week+ hung side of beef.
I love your food videos ! They motivate me so much to eat better & to cook more & I love seeing meal ideas !
I ❤️ you so much Kiera ❤️❤️
What a brilliant video Kiera, huge respect for you for opening up about something so personal. I’ve had huge up and downs with food and my weight and have chronic ibs which makes things even more difficult! Have been wanting to go vegan myself for a long time but with ibs it’s extremely difficult and I haven’t found a way yet. Our relationships with food are such a complicated thing and the focus is always on weight loss above everything so thank you for talking about it from a different angle.
I too find it so hard  to motivate myself to exercise! It'd be great if you could share your journey when you get started ... it really is a mountain to climb ... Does Alex exercise? It's lovely he became vegan with you. Thank you for your videos!
I don't eat fruit. I eat pretty much all veg, but can't get over the fruit mental block :( hopefully one day
I adore you. And I love your what-i-eat-in-a-day videos so much more than most others, because they include a variety of foods of all kinds.
Thank you for producing such an honest video about food. I too had a big problem with textures of food growing up and it is nice to hear someone talking about it! I completely agree than Minamilist Baker is a life saver - has opened my eyes as well. I have only been vegan for 4 months now and have been enjoying getting to know you through your channel. It takes a lot of courage to go online and talk about these things and I really respect you for having the confidence to do so.
I didnt get my weight loss ca. 1,5 years after I went vegan. All the other people mentioned it to me and they still do. Sure, I realized I could downsize my wardrobe here and there in the sizes I needed to buy. I still don't weigh myself. That's what I stopped since I moved out from my parents house. Avery helpful video. Thank you Kiera. All the love. <3
Wow this helped me a lot and opened my eyes. I'm vegetarian and I stress over a lot and I found myself gaining weight rather then losing it. Then again my diet isn't the greatest.. but you've inspired me. I honestly always wanted to go vegan and I will get there one day but thanks for inspiring me!❤️❤️❤️
Just found you through this video loved it I wish I wash brave enough to talk about weight mental health and veganism on youtube but I love watching videos about it 💗
I think your food videos are really awesome! You show that you can eat what ever tasty food you want when you go vegan and you're not hard on your self and you show it for what it is, delicious! Anyone who's is vegan and promoting it is admirable. Not everyone needs or wants to be a health guru. You do you!! You're doing great work.
oh my god, thanks a lot for sharing.
Veganism is so beneficial in so many different ways!\n\nLoved this video <3
You look So gorgeous in this video!
Thank you for sharing this, Kiera!\n\nI used to struggle with eating disorders and when I'm in a bad place in my life, they would come back to haunt me. I recently made a big decision of following a long oppressed dream (becoming an artist) and everything immidiately clicked in place, including my relationship with food. I feel like eating disorders are often (at least for me) only the symptom of something else, something that - as you said - cannot be put into words, cannot be understood. So the ED becomes a cooping mechanism.\n\nRealizing this and turning my life around helped a great deal. Also educating myself on food in general and cutting meat and most of processed food out of my diet made me awere of my health more. Following you here and watching your food related videos always make me feel more confident and happy! :D I'm not vegan, but I love how you show the world that veganism is not some kind of elite lifestyle for the priviliged, but something normal that can be enjoyed by anyone. :) Thank you! ^^
My cat came to sit with my when I clicked on your video. Kind of sweet :)\nI (like so so so many others) have struggeled with food from a young age. I'm 29 and I'm still not OK with it, but since going vegan it's gotten better. I focus more on health than on weight and slowly but surely I think I'm actually heading somewhere :) \nThank you so much for sharing. You're such a wonderful and inspiring human being xx
Self defence classes? Hell yeah, become more like Xena!
I love this. I relate to this so much and I can say right now, my relationship with food is not the greatest. No one would even consider me fat but I was very overweight when I was younger and I still tend to feel like a little fat girl this was inspiring.
I had a very similar experience with food, I hadn't eaten onions until I was about 17 and only tried courgettes this year! I do not like a lot of food textures and I have a lot of food aversions! It was really nice listening to someone else talk about this The environment I grew up in wasn't good, and I was fed nothing but chicken nuggets and chips and other freezer food, when I moved in with my other parent at 14 it was mad, I'd never really seen fresh vegetables in my home before that and it's been such a long journey to start eating properly and enjoying food! Cooking is a big part of my life now and I also find it very therapeutic! I recently got into exercising, an I've been doing the wii fit aha, retro I know, but it's nice exercising when nobody can see you!
Thank you for this video. My eating disorder history is different but it is nice to see that you have gotten better and made progress. Seeing you talk about it and how it got easier is really encouraging.
Thank you so much for this video. I'm on my own journey to resolving my life long issues with exercise and food and it is so inspiring to see someone who has gone through simillar struggles and has come so far. No matter how many videos I watch of super healthy exercise and diet people I watch I never know where to begin but your channel actually makes it seem possible. Thank you for showing me that I'm not alone.
Ah I’m so proud of you! (And Alex!) thank you for sharing this with us 💕 you’re so amazing and definitely continue to inspire me. I’ll forever love your videos, super chill and feels like I’m hanging with my friend ❤️ (I’ve stuck around since your red hair days! And your pink/ purple fringe and blue hair days lol) so glad you’ve stuck with YouTube. Thank you 😊 much love 💕
This video made me tear up. Your story is very similar to mine, wow. I did eat more of a variety of foods at home as a child, but still did a lot of overeating. The part where you talk about being a great student but still dreading school, being very introverted, wondering why you couldn't be like the other kids, was me as well. I'm in the process of making the switch to vegetarianism right now. Two months in, and I thought it would be hard, but I've been figuring out lots of recipes that I love which makes it easier every day. ❤️ (And trying to refrain from putting cheese on EVERYTHING 😅.) Anyway, thank you for sharing your story. ❤️
Thank you for talking about it. It is really meaningful for me.
I've been subscribed to you for years now. I relate to you on so many levels. This video however just blew my mind. Our stories are so unbelievably similar. Thank you for  being brave enough to share your experiences. And thank you for normalising and demistifying veganism as much as you do. You, and your videos, are very much appreciated ❤️
you're hair looks amazing!!! it really compliments your face <3
I don't know if you will get to read this because there are so many comments already! I really relate to what you're saying, I was underweight because I couldn't eat when I was stressed, which was all the time pretty much. I struggled with food because of textures too! Also, when I started up a relationship, with who is now my husband, everything changed for me. He was so encouraging and ate so many different foods, and there was no pressure to like them. If I didn't like a vegetable he would ask why and find something else I might get on with, or suggest cooking it in different ways like roasting broccoli for example. I don't eat perfectly but feel so much healthier, I'm happy with my weight and have alot more confidence in myself. My point being that you've done amazingly, and I can really appreciate the progress you've made
Maybe try trampolining classes for fitness? Could be really fun and a great throwback!
Thank you for making this video Keira! \n\nyour food videos have always been a big help to me, reminding me how important it is for me to be chill about food, eat that ice cream, try that fake cheese ect \nveganism has also done so so much for me in repairing my very broken relationship with food
I so know the feeling. For years I've been struggling with weight loss my weight going always up an down. That is until almost 10 months ago I went vegeterian and like you said tried out a lot of new foods like lentils or all kind of veggies. Sure enough without even  focusing on it I slowly over the months lost some weight. I don't really like the scale so I only noticed It when my clothes especially pants felt looser and people started mention it. It really is a feeling from within it just feels right. A healthier mind got me a healthier body that I'm slowly accepting for what is :) - loved hearing of your story and experience. You show food in a very natural and easy way that I think a lot of people understand better myself included 😊
I can relate to this so much I've grown up as the most awkward fussy eater, my mom would always cook me my own separate dinner without any veggies in cause I hate certain textures. It's got so bad that me and my partners friends won't invite us out to certain restaurants because they worry I will not be able to eat anything on the menu 😞 I feel like I really need to be open minded to trying new foods especially fruit and veg. I'm really glad you did this video it made me feel like I'm not the only one who has food struggles ❤
Great video! I was also a very plain picky eater as a kid (only ate white food i.e. Chicken and potatoes) so I can relate a lot! I started being more adventurous with food (also as a result of meeting my boyfriend) and now I love trying new things my family are constantly amazed at the change 😜😜 have you tried any recipes from Monami Frost's vegan cookbook?
You look extremely beautiful always. and i think you are a great person
Thanks so much for sharing your journey with us! :) \nI felt the same when I went vegan - I lost some weight, but I gained a whole new world of delicious food, compassion, knowledge and I feel the best I've ever felt - the weight is just a thing that happened along side that!
Great video! It was so interesting to learn more about your lifestyle. Thanks for sharing. :)
Thank you for sharing your story. It is a brave thing to do and it's a brave thing to share what you eat to the world especially if you've struggled with food in your lifetime because people can be really brutal online. Here you are not hiding behind a veil like the people who judge you are and putting yourself out here and it's really inspiring. I love to hearing that despite the judgement you recognize your own personal achievements like eating a variety of foods. I can't tell you how much this really does help. You seem like such a sweet person and I really enjoy your videos and hope you enjoy inspiring others with what you make.
Thanks for sharing your journey! Sorry you suffered a traumatic event that affected you so adversely! Just look at how far you’ve come!! Be kind to yourself!! Love your channel!
Veganism has also changed my life! It's so lovely when things fall into place. Thanks for sharing your story. It resonated with my own story so much.
At 21 years old I’ve never met or even heard anyone else being so ‘fussy’ with food like me. For as long as I can remember I’ve struggled with the textures of food and in consequence have a really basic diet, also being vegetarian that doesn’t even eat fruit and veggies is practically unheard of lol. It’s so reassuring hearing that you’ve managed to overcome this your self and gives me hope for the future that I can do this myself
Awww Kiera. I still remember asking if you were vegan a long while ago and you said you weren't yet. Your journey is amazing. So many animals saved. You look so beautiful , you always have quite frankly...oh and the grown out fringe definitely becomes you! <3 from Long Beach, CA USA
Food has controlled my life. I've always been an over eater. After lots of therapy I realised I was an emotional secret eater. It stemmed from my parents break up and propelled by an abusive relationship.\n\nI'd found myself having secret weekends of eating. I had a process; all takeaways, eaten from the tubs (eating from the plate made it 'real food') and then throwing it in the outside bin. I would be on the verge of vomiting. After 48 hours of snap out of it and spit out my food and go back to normal.\n\nI gained so much weight and was so unhappy. It wasn't until I started therapy that I realised that I associated food to being happy, especially the Friday night takeaways with my family before mum and dad broke up. Main food was fried chicken, and I'd eat a lot of it. \n\nTwo years ago I went veggie and felt like I had some control. Then earlier this year I got ill. It's taken me months to work out what was wrong. Turned out that I have fat malabsorption (which causes horrid side effects). The theory is that my years of consuming high fat foods then stripping it back repeatedly ruined my gastric system.\n\nI'm now vegan and on the road to healing. I still have my moments when I just want to eat and eat and tell no one, but I'm open about it and tell my fella. Being not so secret about it make it easier to control.\n\nKeira - thank you for being so honest. You're honest and have no shame and it means that people like me can be honest too. \n\nLove you x
Oh my god this video was so personal thank you for sharing 💗 your thoughts from childhood were so heartbreaking but comforting at the same time to hear someone else feel the same. I'd like to think that if our younger selves knew each other, they would have been pals 💗
Such a lovely and inspiring video...I can really relate to your story and struggle. Well done on getting so far! Xxx
Great video Kiera! Talking about food and diet on here (especially if you're vegan) can be so nerve-wracking! I used to be a pretty picky eater myself but once I cut out meat from my diet I was sort of forced to try so many new things - most of which I really enjoyed! I follow Dana too, she's so unbelievably helpful. ohsheglows is pretty amazing too ^_^ Hope you and Alex had a lovely anniversary!
thank you for sharing your story <3\ni've also struggled with food my whole life, had anorexia as a teen, but now that i'm vegan (been vegan for 14 months) my symptoms have lessened significantly, i feel a lot less guilty about eating and have managed to maintain a healthy & stable weight - i think the knowledge that i'm making a difference by eating plant-based really helped me feel better about food\ni've also been going to therapy which has helped, and figuring out the root causes for my mental health issues has given me so many tools to improve
you look beautiful and your so brave x
You are an amazing person Kiera!!! Keep on being fab x
You are the only person that helped me stop feeling ashamed of being a size 16 because I think you are so unbelievably beautiful and it helps me think that I might be beautiful too ❤
Anyone who would dis your diet or lifestyle or tear apart your daily menu must be extremely disillusioned by something that has absolutely nothing to do with you, personally.  Every video you make is honest and non judgmental to anyone out there. Why there are people out there in the www (is that an old term?, I'm over 50 yo so sorry if I'm not up to date), who seem to seek out reasons to hurt people are doing well in their lives? Hopefully these few ( and I sincerely hope they are few) who feel they must take time out of their day to make disparaging remarks about ANY of your videos will soon realize that it's not YOU or anyone else but THEY who have a problem. Sorry to go on for so long.
so important! amazing video hun x\ni've noticed it's quite common for many people that after going vegan their relationship with food changed. \nin my case...I don't want to say that I forgot about my ED but it just....I don't know, different things started to be more important and I was just so excited about foods? With trying new things - high five. As a kiddo the only veggies I ate were chips and mushrooms. Maybe cauliflower. And now? Look at me! For dinner today I had bowl of SALAD bigger than my head :P\nI'm so happy that you're doing better and that you having back control over what's happening :*\nLots of love :*\n\nalso - vegans judging other vegans over who's more vegan - GTFO\nanimals don't care if you eat raw till 4, if you're frutarian, if you juicing all day or if you stuff your face with mac n cheese. As long as it's vegan, you're good to go!
You are #22 trending! Really interesting video I went vegan almost two years ago and it really changed the way I thought about food. Also it helped with binge eating (for me chocolate) when things aren't vegan I have absolutely no desire to eat them 👌🏽
this video was so honest and real and from the heart <3 thank you for sharing Kiera, you'll have helped so many xo
I SPY A NEW PLANT BABY!
I agree with other commentators that if you want to exercise more, then find something you LOVE! ^____^ I started hula hooping/ hoop dancing almost 2 years ago, and I love it so much because it is FUN and creative! :) And as a circus skill, anyone can learn it, all it takes is practice!  \nThank you for this video, even if if was super hard for you to do, you did a great job, and you are making me more and more interested in becoming vegan! ^____^ X
YOUR HAIR LOOKS SO GOOD
I hadn't eaten all those vegetables or really ANYTHING either until I went veg and pretty much forced myself into it
Your hair is amazing right now
*you should try proper working out*\n*i used to hate it when i started myself pretty late in life, but then i learned to love it!*\n*most things in life we don't like when we're not good at them, but no one is good at anything he has never tried*
I bloody love your what I ate videos. I think it shows what real life is like and that not everyone is a health nut. Vegan ism personally isn't for me but I think your videos also show that veganism isn't just a bunch of salads all the time. You're looking fabulous and as long as you are happy then that's brilliant 👏🏻💕
I think everyone in the comments will hate me for this but... In one of your really earlier videos I did make a comment to you about my concern that there was a lack of vegetables and fruit and now I really regret what i wrote, I wasnt trying to be rude I thought I was trying, in my weird way, to look out for you. I thought I was being helpful, but wasn't aware of the issues you faced, so I want to take this moment to apologise, I'm sorry and I really hope that I didn't offend you.
<3
❤️❤️❤️
I like food
Vegan trending? What the hell.
You're amazing💜
Love u 💓

It’s nice to see a vegan, and I know not all vegans are like this but they do exist, who doesn’t force veganism down non vegans throats because they see it as a superior way of life when they a lot of the time themselves are restricting their diets so much they have border line eating disorders that are not healthy and sustainable in the long run. She just seems to natural and real like a normal vegan with a diet that is healthy and makes her happy, it’s nice. Sorry for the paragraph just thought I would say 😂
Ah white ppl problems\nIf I was middle class I'd make more important videos
how the fuck is this trending gtfo

someone pls report that sex comment i dont know
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is probably the best martial art for females.
Your arms are huge and fingers are fat. No wonder you’re wearing black.
There are five things we teach\n\n*names 4 things
great series, love how he was honest with the ratings lol
how does someone who knows nothing to little about preparing food get a food show???\n*white privilege
nope, no raw fish for me, i dont want vibrio cholerae in me
Does Sean do any stand up comedy? I'd love to see some of that
Anyone realize this guy appeared in GMM Crew ep with mike and Alex and they made sushi like the spider one
You better not replace Sean ever, or you'll lose all your subs
8:31 That's much better than at the truck stop.  Sean, open up a sushi truck stop.
No such thing as a 1950s mustang. They came out in 1964
lose the playa watch please!
Hey guys. Commenting here so I can plug Jiro Dreams of Sushi, one of the greatest sushi documentaries out there, and quite possibly one of the greatest documentaries of all time. You guys should definitely take the time to watch it. That's all.
more of a snowflake situation. killed me
I like how you are switching it up. Good job man.
sean is not even fun to watch. boring hipster dressing motherfucker
The chef reminds me of Adam Sandler for some reason
I really enjoyed the video, but you don't need to stay in character all the time. This segment seemed a little forced.
Little finger action?  That didn't sound right haha
I love Sean, but his knife technique is horrendous.
Mustangs didn’t exist until the end of 1964 nerd. No such thing as a “round 1950’s mustang”.
He has so much pride about making sushi it’s very wholesome
Love sushi! Thanks Sean your videos are always making me hungry and teaching me simultaneously.
Honestly if Sean made my sushi I wouldn't know if he was a pro or a rookie lolol
Honestly super proud of Sean. Great work! 
here's what I don't understand, why scale the fish if you're going to fillet it? what was the point of scaling if you're cutting the skin off the flesh anyway?
3:26 Never heard of a straight bass Sean
I'm a fan, but - I just don't think the world needed another white people learn to make sushi in ten minutes short, you know? I feel like it's been done and done and *done* at this point.
Where did you see a 1950s mustang?
Shawn is my favorite internet personality rn, so genuine and funny. Thank you for the content !!!
lol 1950's Mustang
1950s mustang
1950 mustang?
nice gold watch
watch more great video on Indian cooking click photo
“Like a 1950’s mustang” he says. Too bad they debuted in 1964😑😑
I'm going to pretend you meant a 50's P51 Mustang and not the car, seeing as how the fish on the rice kinda looks like the body of a P51!
You're such a good host
Can you invite Pewdiepie again?\nI know the first time you invited him! But he turned you down because he's busy!
What watch is that sean
Become a sushi chef in two months......... Lol
The mustang released in 1964 1/2. Damn Sean. Letting down the Midwest.
Hey Shawn hold the spine of the knife just above the handle with your thumb and for finger and wrap the rest around the handle  you will get better control of the knife
Mustangs fist got introduced in 1964 1/2 but I definitely knew what you meant 😆
Need hot sauce to eat it or what?
So we filleted our straight bass\nSean...it's striped bass.
So 1:30 in and already they are lying to me. That is not a a stripped bass. The lines are broken.
I want to eat sushi off of Sean, Fantano, and Binging with Babish's shiny bald heads.
0o0 when he chops the fishys head
When they're cutting near the beginning you can see how inexperienced he is just by his knife technique when cutting to the middle bone because he holds the knife with his finger on the blade.  Surprised the teacher didn't  point it out
I would be dope for them to have a video on traditional shojin ryori sushi.
Plot twist the Asian guy on the thumbnail is Sean.
I hope he meant p-51 mustangs, not Ford mustangs........
Ik he's not a car guy but a 1950's mustang is not a thing 😂 mustangs became a car in 1964.5
That intro is what I like to call sushi porn
The justin Timberlake of food 
Sooo... There's an anime with this premise right?
It's still just a finesse game the chef is just moving forward...lmao I love Sean
Dude's such a sushi master that he has sponsor logos on his chef jacket
I feel like Sean Evans is so robotic and has no personality. He's like the Jason Bateman of interviewers
Gotta love those 1950's mustangs that came out in 1964 and 1/2.
as someone getting into blades and sharpening.  I have nothing but the utmost respect for a sushi chefs and how well they can sharpen their knives
Someone call Flava Flav Sean has the guy's clock on his wrist.
now kill a chicken next and make wings from scratch :)
that blonde girl... damn stole the show
There is not a 1950's Mustang. LOL
Sean's roll looked pretty dodge but I bet it still tasted nice as fuck!
Shawn Evans acts like a female.....jeeezzz
1:04 that's only four things.  Not five things.
Lol love it, 1950's mustang hahaha you killed it bro

2 months and best sushi chef ? Are you joking ? \nIt takes a minimum of 10 years to be a sushi chef !
rounded out like a 1950s mustang? i think sean needs to stick to eating chiken wings
Me: *googles* how many eyes do spiders have\nGoogle: Most spiders have eight eyes. Some have no eyes and others have as many as 12 eyes. Most can detect only between light and dark, while others have well-developed vision.\nMe: .......THAT'S RIGHT! MY SPIDER IS NOT LIKE MOST SPIDERS IT'S DIFFERENT AND HAS 4 FUCKING EYES.
Such a great work! You kill it,
She could have used black duct tape. Would have been easier

Okay. I cant get over the fact how loyal you two both are to each other. Y'all both have been together fpr 2-3 years, moved into a bomb ass house, got engaged,had a son, then move into another bomb ass house. Yall have the funniest little arguments but whem its ovet tell each other 'i love', you both make the craziest pranks on each other and you either get pissed or cry but in the end tell each other 'I love you' . yall can act totally ridiculous in public or not but never be embarrassed of each other. Yall both will do anything for each other amd it sets so much goals for people and its so inspiring.❤\nYall just keep doing what yall are doing cause you both dont know how much you impact on yalls fans and set huge examples for love. You both are the best parents dominic will ever ask for and you both are going to raise him so well!💕 #wilsonfamily

Superman will come back on the 3rd day. Biblical speaking: Man of Steel [his 1st] shows off his miracles (his kryptonian powers), Lex (The devil) and world hates him/He dies in BvS [his 2nd] and Batman's sinful ways has disappeared after Supes dies, his disciples (The Justice League) will see him resurrect on the 3rd day!
im more hyped for this than thor
What is Wonder Woman saying at 1:13???
I'm more hype on Thor..
Ben Affleck will drag JUSTICE LEAGUE Movie down....
The hype! I swear if this ends up like suicide squad
the collectors from mass effect 2
Okay they used the Beatles,they used David Bowie, let's hope this movie isn't a waste.
The trailer looks so bad and the story is probably not gonna catch me but still I'll go and watch it lol
If you paused it to see her ass in the beginning you're going to hell.
I'm just happy the comics we love are now in movies and on TV.  Marvel, DC, Vertigo who cares? Just bring it on!
without superman justice league is my dhoner matha...
That flash looks so gay
I know DC and Marvel are competing companies but I need that Aquaman and Thor team up film
This movie is gonna look great on my Virtual Boy
Right bring in Deathstroke,nightwing, green arrow , constantine , make a film about Batman incorporated, lady Shiva, Jason Todd as red hood, Damian Wayne , teen titans movie, a decent version of Mr freeze, and deadman and zatanna, I would give my right foot if these get made decently in a film
I just love flash 😂😂😂😂😂
only thing I don't like it's Flash
It looks great, I hope it does not disappoint.
Anyone here read it as official honest trailer? only me? ok
So at what time in the movie does Superman appear?
They forgot about Hal Jordan. I'm not mad just disappointed
I just hope that batman can nail wonder woman, I always wanted that in the animated show
wonder women is fucking hot af
This is why DC is beyond Marvel. It compares to now!
That'd be cool if that was Supergirl at 2:00. 😊
DC is going to kill this genre of film. *sigh* it was nice while it lasted.
AA police notes. The Centerfold murders.\n\nThe Aussie, British, Swedish, Italian, Drum and Bass, homosexual paedophiles and Russian ey group are the Centerfold murderer's.\nThey are targeting beautiful women in fashion to kill calling them the T group, Buddhists, hippies or Yoga and the Church.\nThe new AA police recruits are being attacked and will recipricate all this in Asia to anyone doing this to our people.\nThe T group, Church, Buddhists, Scottish, American and the Queen are the Center and the Aussie ey are the Centerfold murderers and doing this to make women in America and Europe to mix with blacks only. \nThe ey lead the FBI in America and they hate Americans and religions. They led the Americans to war with Vietnam a war the Americans didnt want but its led by the ey group, Aussies and British army. They are the homosexual Centerfold murderers. And this is why they forced American troops to war with Japan and Vietnam all led by Italians, Aussies, blacks, Jamacians, British and Spanish.\nAnd not by Americans nor the Church.\nAnyone associated with the Aussie, Swedish, black, British ey group can be arrested by an inprisoned by AA police recruits in Asia and American Buddhists zones and made to compensate the T group when under such an attack.
CHristian Bale should've played batman not ben AFFLAC (duck voice)
Wow they just ruined one more joke, now im not gonna laugh at the movie itself.
I'm just glad it doesn't look totally emo like all the other shit DC's been putting out recently. it actually looks like it might have some heart associated with it.
Superman!!!!!!!!!! Cant wait to see the black suit
Its so obvious Christopher Nolan is way better director than Zack Snyder!! Zack lack of a lot of things even backgrounds is just horrible, Batman movie was really great and now its like cartoon under Zack synder
*early 2000's announcer voice*\nGal Gadot _is_ .... the most beautiful woman in the world. Also, Wonder Woman.
Marvel's gay cousin X Michael Bay aesthetic X bad writing= this trailer.
holy shit the AMOUNT OF SPAM ON THIS VIDEO.\ncursed comment section.
😂Is Joker there in this Movie😂
Yeah I know that zack synder is a fan of superman
I HAVE A CRAZY THEORY \nJust a theory \nWhat if Alfred is talking to \n2 People In the end
I got it.... \nLois Lane  becomes Super Woman...
Can’t wait for that resurrection moment from Superman, supersayan/jesus Christ style!
How long do u think before wade wilson makes a green lantern cameo?
Is it just me but I really hate DC action scenes
I hope the CGI gets better when its released, it looks pretty lackluster.
Schlock for days. This movie will suck
If I had to guess, Superman probably shows up towards the end of the movie and does some crazy hero shit
Two songs I love are going to be remembered and memed because of a film that will be a huge hit or miss. Damn.
Can we give some credit to Ciaran Hinds for such a powerful screen presence and Voice?
Pl;ease tell me they didn't make a Justice League movie without Superman, right ?
Enjoy the trailer because the movie is going to suck.
Justice League vs. Avengers Infinity War, who´s win?
others superhero.. in the next film.
The worst thing about this movie will be graphics. What's up with red? it's so depressing.
Ezra Miller was horribly miscast!
muchhhhh better than eminemns shit rant
Dem Aquaman one liners tho\nMY MAN
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQDo5QuZTaw worlds most liked teaser .... support us
y detective marciano?xd
super excited!
MY MAN!
Meh
Bollywood celebrity Priyanka Chopra some hot attractive  unseen rare clips just watch it \nhttps://youtu.be/1jfJU5abC6A
Jeez this movie gives me goosebumps
Meh.
So cool
NOT MY BARRY ALLEN!
where darkseid tho?
1:38 who is this faggot
Kind of whack
Coloca ao menos legenda nessa merda caralho!
2:28 GAL <3
Something darker HYPE
2:27
This feels so forced
tengo q ver esta película ya!! 🙌💥🔥💣
David Bowie❤
No doubt the movie of the year 💪👌🏻
Transformers is a masterpiece! This is a masterpiece of SHIT!
Your like battered housewives, all you bleating about how this is good
Why does this look bad
I'd be okay with the new dc movies if batman didn't look so chubby and if they actually took the time to make movies for each of the members instead of rushing a justice league movie to try to compete with marvel
I see it now, this movie is gonna be a piece of shit
Worst Batman, bring back Christian Bale
Cyborg looks horrible
What is that flashing thing at 2:27?
I believe that Cyborg was in Teen Titans and Teen Titans Go
Haha I'm superman 😅
I don't know why DC is proud of themselves. They can't make films like doctor strange with high visual effects quality. Marvel is way more better than Snyder's artificial green screen shots
At least this movie isnt about being in some ugly ass empire or city in space like thor
Wow! This preview actually looks good! I'm surprised! Still needs Red Robin though...or, at least Nightwing... Batman needs a Robin! No matter what he thinks he wants... (+1 for any one that gets that reference...)
I hope I can see this lineup on the big screen someday:\n1. Superman \n2. Batman\n3. Wonder Woman \n4. Green Lantern \n5. Flash\n6. Aquaman\n7. Martian Manhunter\n8. Cyborg \n9. Green Arrow \n10. Black Canary\n11. Zatanna \n12. Shazam\n13. Dr. Fate\n14. Hawk Woman \n15. Supergirl
DCEU’s last chance to make a good movie
ok - it deffinetly looks cool, I am just afraid that they won t be able to introduce 2 completely new characters, new villains and re-introduce batman in 1 movie :/ but hey, we ll see - it still can be great movie :)
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see this.\n *THIS IS NOT CLICK BAIT!* Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me *share it* with others. *There's HOPE!* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v67V3KtaSno
Rarely have i seen such legendary epicness. \n\nHoping that Batman says the we won't win without our big gun line.
1:46. Zack Snyder shot...
I WISH SUPERMAN WAS THERE! This movie better be lit AF!
Ugh, its like they are trying so hard to be Marvel, but they miss on every point. The CG? Way over done and takes up way too much of what you are seeing. The humor? Dead pan, lame, simply not funny. The action? I mean shit, you guys saw Wonder Woman, that awkward slow-mo shit? terrible.
Fat Batman
Marvel did better lol step up your game DC!
Bruno is so awesome\n No wonder why he is the pop king of this generation. I admire him so much. HOOLIGANS CAN Y'ALL RELATE?!
King of Talents. Give him all the existent awards already!!
Oh man that voice and those back ups 👍👍👍
For all these autotuned ass singers please be able to sing live cause if not we know u can't sing. Bruno sounds good wit auto tune, without auto tune, he sounds great live and even better accapela so if u don't like of love Bruno mars the u on some strong ass week or coke💯💯
I guess this song means he learned his lesson in *When I Was Your Man* and now treating his girl right.
And this is why I watch Charlie Rose!
The next backpack kid
why is he sitting in backpack?
I love this song. It's very good
Still sounds just as good

Who's that little monkey that danced around on Kimmel?-Joey Diaz.
Is there anything this handsome man can't do.?
Im sorry i didnt ask you if u liked it bitch
This would have been better if they did an acapela version just to show off bruno's voice even more
Reppin’ the 808! Love that hat
IT SOUNDS JUST LIKE THE SONG
All i can say is 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👍👍woooh! Bruno can only do that...hands down
I would drink your bath water Bruno
Charlie Rose is such an old fuddy duddy.

Wait until you see the SEX Tape Bruno made with Steve Harvey.. Repugnant ! You'll never guess which one was the pitcher & which one was dressed like Little Bo Peep.. swashbuckling Madness
Most underrated artist/performer. I don't always like his songs but he is very talented and a great entertainer.
They harmonize so well it's not even funny

can i ask??\nGOT7 album sales 7 FOR7 is very good. but competitors very strong this time!!\nso is it GOT7 comeback at the wrong time ???\nsorry..just ask😁✌
TAKE TIME\nFor GOT7 to get nominated next week (October 23-28) and get another win (which will be their last stage) let us stream hard for this week (our crucial week - October 16-22) both YT and Korean music charts (specially MelOn, etc.). If some of us can’t stream some of the music charts, stream YT and buy their album. Let us all fight and make this year as GOT7’s year. IGOT7 fighting!!!! \n\n\nP.S. Some of us must message JYPE regarding the album’s out of stock, they must produce this week and also every time that GOT7 makes a comeback they must produce 300k for the 1st week sales. \n\n #GOT7 #7for7 #YouAre #갓세븐
Heh. Anyone here?

I love your crew! This video had my daughter and I cracking up. When will we meet the crew?!?
This has been my favorite video yet- one day I'd love to see the faces behind Spice Girls 2.0 😂👍🏼
JJR ~ I condition the gum paste with shortening as well as rub the outside of the gum paste with shortening before inserting into my extruder.  It works.  Thanks for the laughs!!!  :D
There are definitely five Spice Girls, guys. \n\nSporty, Baby, Ginger, Scary, and Posh.
Can I please marry Brandon?😂 He seems so funny!
Sorry jjr, I also love spice girls soooo. I actually like them singing. Bwuahahaha
do a collab with yollonda or how to cake it
the spider looks like a crab
FUNNIEST post ever! Cake very cool too.
Lol
Hi Joshua i liked  your cake design and I’m wondering what type of gold paint do you used??please provide the name Thxs
Amazing how do u do it
Its Saturday and I'm STILL singing Spice Girls songs!\nThanks guys!
I really appreciated watching the struggle of innovation. It made me feel like it is totally worth every time I try something new. Thanks!!
The middle of the video is a hot mess haha
The guys should sing in every episode.
but the spice girls are amazing especially with spice cake
What do you have against Spice girls Joshua ? lol
This thumb up was for the Spice Girls enthusiasts behind the camera. You guys rocked.
I was the grudge for my freshman year of college.... totally won the costume contest! It was badass
I HATE SPIDERS.\nNo wonder this didn't appear in my sub list.
I’m so scared of spiders that it gives me chills even seeing you make it, especially the pointy legs of them but I couldn’t help but watch till the end and it’s beautiful
You love the Spice Girls and you know it! Friendship never eeenndss!
This was extremely good I loved it plz make more videos
To make you feel better there are 5 Spice girls, so Brandon is a little less creepy now. Well on that end of the spectrum 😂
JJR, the spice Girls are nothing to be ashamed of! We all love them, even you! Don't fight the spice.
Where do you get all of your shirts??? I love them!!!
Found your channel from iJustine! Love it.
He hates the Spice Girls,  tries to use a drill to make gum paste strings for decoration, and knows what channel locks are. Yep, definitely a Man . . . About Cake.\n\nAs for my costume, I'll be dressing up as a skeleton for work, but my husband wants us to dress up as peanuts so we can be nuts together.
Does whatever a spider cake does
I love this cake
Next Video please collab with How to Cake It
Aw, JJR, the crew's singing is great though!!! Love the cake (even though I'm arachnaphobic) and the crew!
Can you do a vampire team please. Beacuse I am a big fan of Twilight movie.🖒👍👍
Long time ago I made and wore an autumn-themed costume  (that was inspired by Marjorie the Trash Heap on the puppet show FRAGGLE ROCK)  to work which won 2nd place in the costume contest. It was a separate hood over a long sleeved maxi length dress out of soft, drape coral-orange knit fabric; covered over with preserved florist autumn leaves and stems that I had meticulously appliquéd by hand. The accessory was a fan rake and to remove ANY doubt as to what I was supposed to be, my name tag read:  Pile-a Leaves!\nYou could make an Pile of Leaves autumnal cake like that too.  Bet it would be gloriously golden and gorgeous!
Really bitch! I was about to go to sleep and then I seen this video in my recommendation 💀💀😢😢
For the record, there were FIVE Spice Girls. Not four ;)
I love that all the guys started singing spice girls lol 🤣🤣😂
Love the Halloween opening!!!
You put a top panel on you middle tier. Did the gumpaste stay soft enough for the bubble tea straws
Is that like a weird instrumental of ghost town in the background???
Honestly I think the spider would have been creepier if he would left it bone white and painted the top-tier gold underneath it. Cuz then I would look like a weird Fusion of the skeleton and spider
One of my most favourite video...if you wanna be my lover LOL 😂
This was one of the funniest episodes ever!!!  I loved watching this one!
I like the added Spice Girls 😅
Their singing is beautiful
me and my best friend are thing 1 and thing 2
My best Halloween costume (or, at least, my favorite) was Eric Draven from The Crow. I was about twelve or thirteen, wore an all black outfit with a life-sized crow decoration stitched to the shoulder of my shirt (and of course I had the makeup). It was awesome, and we didn't even get to go trick or treating that year -_-
I absolutely love your work!!!! Please please please do a two sided cake!!!!!!
The Halloween intro is amazing
New subscriber here if u wanna be my lover you gotta get with my friends making it last forever frrrrieeeendships never ennnnnnnd😂😂😂😂😁😁😁
Hello I have a question. Is there a reason u don't paint before and touch up after? Just curious.
I wonder where all the cakes go?
The banter between them all made this more enjoyable! Not that it wouldn't be without it but it made me smile 🤗
Loved the singing 😂😂😂,  your cake's look so yummy and beautiful ,  love you're show.
My best costume was a cardboard refrigerator running
This channel needs more singing 😂😂😂
Best halloween costume was was probably han solo, my friends were chewy, luke and Leia
I want to make a hALloween  but I am terrible at cakes and desserts
I am so in love with this cake!!
You and your crew are my favorite people
Hello👍 could you possibly do a Frankenstein cake?? And the original Frankenstein please😊😊
Phantom of the Opera, clothing sucked but I'm proud of the makeup I did.
I HAVE ARACHNAPHOBIA WHO ELSE DOES
I'm sorry Josh, but i feel they should sing more
😍😍
When I was 11, I had two costumes.  One for the town Halloween parade and one for actual Halloween.  For the parade, I was a golf ball.  For Halloween, I was a munchkin.  Donut munchkin.
I absolutely love the crew! You guys rock! JJR you need to sing along man, singing good for the soul!!
People gold shame me all the time
I always like watching your videos. You make beautiful ckes
The bloopers and the singing kinda made this better... and that spider was awesome, this woukd an an awesome cake for someone getting married around Halloween ^_^.
This episode was hilarious! I feel your pain with that extruder that would make me crazy!! Lolllll. This cake is amazing! And yes I have a crazy fear of spiders but you made it look incredible! Great job as always!

Nice!!!
''Hauntingly beautiful.''\n\n                   J.J.R.
To clarify: I never said I was definitely returning it (or the company took it back), I said we'll see if they let me! as a joke, knowing I've done a lot of stuff in it and also made a video documenting me doing those things, implying that they would definitely not let me return it. Sorry if that didn't come across or if anyone got confused! xox
Wow I like all those things!!
The more uncomfortable you seem, the wealthier you are. #hmm
This video made me so extremely uncomfortable that I couldn't watch it but i love all ur other videos
CRISTINE OUT OF HER MAIN HABITAT I DONT KNOW WHAT TO THINK
This was a good video until crisrein showed up
At Disney her skirt flew up
this video made my day. after laughing so much :) love saf so much. she is truly one of a kind.
There are hairy leggings and once I saw them I thought Saf would wear these so here you go
You should wear all the “ugly” stuff for a day  or week
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE SAF GOT HER MINI BACKPACK. I NEED IT 4:07
One spin and everyone is getting slapped
Oh my god, I could not BREATHE for the day seven jacket. This is the hardest I've ever laughed at one of your videos.
you should wear heelys for a week!!
also saf looks like those car wash advertising blowing figures (completely unsure what these are called oops)
Lol me when I try on those type of jackets
i think the next invention will be mom jeans with clear patches on the butt
am i the only one who noticed she had to blur her butt while twirlling. i love her so much XD
8:41 reminds me of when Mulan was trying to drink Tea in her matchmaker scene xD
Hey guys pleaseee check out my account. Im trying really hard to get some viewsss. ONLY POSIIVE COMMENTS PLEASE. Thanks I love all my fans and really once I'm famous you can say you subscribed first. ANyway love you guys. I love magic school bus so my username and alias is based off of that
5:26 made me laugh like crazy 😂 I loved that
I live for saf's cute weird dances lol
You should make a video of all of your ugliest clothes that you've done and put them all together
i completely lost it when you started dancing with the flailing tube man, oh my lord
_Have you ever worried about your sleeves falling down when you wash your hands?_ *_WELL,THIS IS THE JACKET TO DRIVE YOU INSANE_*
If you weren’t gonna return it... why keep the tag on it?
At 5:28 i laughed soo hard, that I couldn't breathe 😂😂
She’s so beautiful
The gas station part had me dead😂
day 3 with the friend killed me :))))) lmao
You could cut the sleeves and it would be cute
Anyone else think of little nightmares?
I wouldn't call it ugly as much as I'd call it impractical
It made me think of those inflatable, dancing  cheese-string-looking things at fairs 😂
WEAR ALL THE “ugliest stuff in the world” TOGETHER FOR A DAY
Seeing her touch everything and then also eat with the sleeves..... SAF PLEASE NO
THIS VIDEO MADE ME SO UNCOMFORTABLE
I couldn't stop laughing the whole video😂😂😂
The whole time i was like bish be carefull u needda get yo 700 dollars back 🤣😭
I must know where you got that bat bag oh my goooshhh
Comes for Safiya being weird in public; leaves with historical facts about long sleeves in regards to social class
I actually love it with the rolled up sleeves and the folded sleeves, but 100% needs to cost less lol
i want to know where she got her jeans from the 1st outfit i love them!!!! SAFIYA I HOPE YOU SEE THIS AND RESPOND!!!!!!!!
when your tall friend lends you their jacket
Slender man would wear that jacket XD
Ngl I was kinda feeling the outfit with the giant burgundy trousers.
I just have to like binge watch your videos bc they always make me so happy 😂
I would wear it
I kind of like them 😏
Looking Numbuh 3 from Code Name Kids Next Door.
I’d love to have that jacket
Hey Saf! I feel like those shoes will join to the ugliest family pretty nicely ;D http://www.reebok.com/us/instapump-fury-cv/BD4758.html
I like the little history lessons that she gives. Nice touch Saf.
I never thought I needed this jacket until now.
9:58 THEY HAD TO BLUR HER BUTT LMAO
Very funny, I like you :D
I seriously can't believe ppl disliked this video.....
You should make a diy for this jacket plzzz 😂
On their own, all those pieces are so hideous. But when you put them together...it kind of...dare I say it, works?? How?? Other than the hairy nipple suit, I mean.
Probably the funniest video you have ever made.
When I was four I was completely and utterly terrified by that big red thing
I saw the jacket in Cristine's video and was waiting for an explanation lmao
they always go to Disney, isn't that super expensive? or do people in statte get a discount or something?
Oh yes I knew you would reference slender men
Fashion designers get paid to make fun of customers. Some are literally like, 'Let's see what we can get away with,' and a colleague replies, 'Oh, come on, man; they'll never buy THAT!' and the response is, 'Some idiot will!' It's different if it's for a video, but if anyone actually buys stuff like this to wear it, the people who produce it have successfully punked you!
This video just made me laugh😂
Do more i bought five things from ... sth
I love how carefree she is
This jacket is perfect for people who can’t dance cause they have something else that can distract them from terrible dance moves 😂😂😂
“There is something very liberating about looking like an idiot.”
I have 2 more feet of denim to smack with
did she end up returning it? 😂
You know you’re rich when you spend $700 on a jacket that is hidieous af
5:50, star of the show!!!
lol am i the only one who got super anxious because of the jacket
Yong Junhyung from Highlight wore this lol A Kpop star wore that jacket dunno if the same brand  tho
I'm literally a rhythmic gymnast
Can you try wearing an abaya for a day??
TRY CRUGGS (crocks+uggs)
edward denim hand lol
This is my fav
Ugliest sunglasses?
Haha Safiya at 5:30
Just fold the sleeves.
Saf, you’re beauty with brains.
When you've already shanshed those buttons
still not enuf sleeves
5:46 my replay button died lol \nsafiya attacc mee
Slender man slender man
I'm Edward denim hands 😂🤣
The historic facts. Awesome!
*casually goes to Disney land*
Mix all your highlights
5:27 my fav moment!! Hahahahaha
Slender Man's favorite jacket ♥
Namjoons famous dance anyone?
Slenderman boyfriend jacket
I love safiya and Cristine together
Are you Danish
Omg you look like slender man
I missed the first 2 mins of the video and had to go back because I'm just staring at that perfect liner 😅 how do you do it Suzie! I got the nude bow jumper too and the cape coat I love it haha! <3
We have the same aviator jacket 😬 I love it! It's so warm. Looks great on you x
Love the aviator jacket! Your fashion content is so nice to watch :) xx
Zara is life! Love these pieces!
I have the red jumper with the bow except In cream, but it's gone so bobbly already even though I haven't washed it. Does anyone know how I can save it? So sad it looks so old and worn :(
You're looking good, girl!🙌🏻 Cute Haul!!!
Don’t keep the pink jumper with the black bow doesn’t really look cute and it kinda makes you look wide and hides your figure ✨
The shearling jacket is SO CUTE!
How tall are you?
Me encantaron todas las prendas  <3
She looks like she's coping off Zoella
Olivy, bat wingy, nudy, cardy, camelly, syntheticy, plasticy.....?????
https://youtu.be/DZVJC6guVaY
love the herringbone scarf!!
Love your suede jacket 🌷
Aviator jacket camel jumper and green cardigan are gorgeous. You have lovely style suzie x
Great haul!💖👌
getting that beanie for sure!!
where your earrings from?
Love the cardigans
Happy birthday
pls do more zara haul!!! ♥️
Love your try on hauls 💚 saludos desde Argentina! 💚😘
what do you wear on your lips? The color is so beautiful!!
I love your jewellery in this video. So stylish and simple.
I love this background for your videos. Just so pleasing to look at.
Please can you do an autumn dresses haul?
Ooh lovely haul. You must have been totally in the zone. The red jumper, colour is amazing on you and the grey pearl hat is fabulous. Grey  jumper makes the gold earrings pop and the aviator jacket makes me want to go and try one on. Am not a fan of batwing stuff for myself as they are pain to wear under coats though.
Where is your choker from? Xx
The jeans you’re wearing are fab! Where did you get them?
I like your videos...but I suggest something...you explain everything really well...no need to re-explain when you try them on...you takes ages on every item...loved everything you picked up...👍
I love scarves!!! I'm obsessed with them! 🙈
You're so beaut! Thanks for sharing your haul!
Hi Suzie, Love your video. Thank you. Please can you share where your jeans are from? They are lovely!! Xx
Those jeans ! Where is it from ??? 😍 your body👌
Her youtube channel is called helloOctoberxo...?
loved this haul! recently did a little shopping at Zara as well! :)
My faves were the grey and camel scarf, and the camel jumper! Oh and the cream cardigan😍🙋💛Been looking for one like that for a while! 💖💖
loved so many items! Why have I decided to go capsule wardrobe 😩
How tall are you?
Where are your earrings from, love them!
How did you make your thumbnail where you cut yourself out with the white bit around you? Xx
Hello October, you've come round so quickly! 🍁
Really like this makeup look, I know you said the lipstick is discontinued but I'd love a tutorial of the whole look
Looove those scarves!! I picked a couple up last year and after using the soft ones I couldn't go back to any of my other ones... also, can you link us your jewelry pieces?!
I love the font you use on your thumbnails! What is it called?
Who knows where to find the short necklace that she is wearing? Please?)
good call on the aviator jacket - you're right .. its the perfect length on you! lovely haul - love you!!
where are your earrings from? i love them!!
Oh my I LOVED every single thing in this haul 😍💜
Paused the video to buy the red sweater with the bow. 😂
Number 14 on trending eeeek!!!! Loved this haul, but my bank account did not 😂 love the olive tones and that scarf is lovely 😍
Hey Suzi , just wondering what hairdresser you go to ..? :) loved the haul. Knew you would kill it with an autumn haul. The aviator jacket is sooo flattering on you 😍😍
could you tell me what jeans you are wearing???
Very good video!but i cannot opeen the links!i want to buy firectly things i have got iphone6 and when i cleek on them it goes to a blank page whatever video i  see!can u help?thnk u!
girl im buying every single jumper, cardigans, scarves, and that suede jacket yesssss I love all of them so cosy and pretty and pretty much my style for every autumn and winter season cause dang its cold up here in the north of america 😅☁️🌧🌨🌦☔️
everything is beautiful.. also  the last coat..
That olive cardigan is absolute GOALS! It looks so soft and cozy, which is a must have for the fall! 😍🍂
Where are the white drawers behind you from please?
How tall are you? It would just be helpful in relation to sizing :)
I have the same faux suede jacket and I am soo happy with it! It's so worth buying. Love your hauls, especially Zara ones!!!!😍
Use a bobbypin to fix the snag in your jumper!
Your hair colour is just so nice :D
Everything looks amazing and suits so well! Except I agree that the “cape style” coat at the end doesn’t sit as well as the other pieces.
What lipstick are you wearing? It look amazing on you!! xoxo
When u wear the cuffs over your hands!!! 🙈
I got the same jacket but in pink xD
tha aviator jacket looks so perfect on you !!!! i love ur videos !
Love your style..more of hauls.. I just added everything in wishlist 😍😍💗
Fell in love with your earrings, where are they from? <3
That leather jacket you're wearing when showing the beanie!! Where is it from I've been after a jacket like that!!
I'm sooo gold you said that about jumpers being tight at the bottom and that they're not as flattering. All the jumpers I have that I love are loose and I was just about to get a tight one on ASOS. Ta!  Haha
So jealous that you can wear scarves and sweaters already, we’re still waiting for the cold in New York 😭
These videos are my favourite! Try on hauls are the best.
I bought the cape coat but returned it because it was just too thin. For the money I didn’t think it was worth it. Also didn’t have any washing instructions in it 🙈
I just ordered the oversize cardigan in gray. It will be perfect for when I fly to New Zealand in February. I had to limit my self, but wanted to buy everything in this haul💕
Ohhh so nice! Girl three bags for your birthday- you don't need to justify yourself! Love love love xxx
The grey hat. Love it.
Love the cardigans and herringbone grey /beige scarf, I love the bat wing coat on you, will be best when it's really cold as it looks roomy and big enough to wear a thick jumper underneath and still button it up. Your style is so good Susie X ❤️👍🏻💕
Does anyone know where her gold choker is from? Been looking for it forever xx
Makeup tut on this look please
Love the green cardigan and the suede jacket best.  I love the pink jumper contrasted with the black tie (very Chanel) but I would return since it has pulls in it.
that first grey scarf looks amazing on you! especially with your hair and makeup like that. so pretty <3
Top haul. I have recently become obsessed with Zara this season. I recently bought an insane pale pink and faux fur sweater with huuuge balloon sleeves. It's life. I LOVE it.
You can poke the pulled thread through the jumper (just stretch it a little bit where it's pulled-you will be able to poke it through one of the holes and pull it through from the inside). I have 2 cats I have to do it all the time!
Great video! You got so many cute clothes!! I have a small channel that I am really trying to grow. I would be super grateful if anyone could go check it out!💜
LOVE LOVE LOVE everything from this haul. I'm a short arse too and I need that aviator jacket it's perfect. 👌 Where are you jeans from you're wearing in the cut away frames? Xx
I bought the same sweaters in the exactly same colors😂
What jeans are you wearing?
Where are your jeans from? x
Do you actually try things on in store?
I want that camel jumper on you so much but it’s out of stock :’(
Where are your earrings from?
actually, I think the cape is really cute. It's really stylish and fashionable.
Where is this lipstick from? :)
To be honest I'll never get why anyone would consider something 'high quality' when it's literally made up of only plasticy synthetic fibers like acrylic that will look terrible after a year of wearing...
I just want subs
Youtube made me buy it...so I now got the beige scarf, thanks Suzie ;-). I'd totally be in favour of a Bag Collection video :-)
Love this zara haul would love to see more of these
Love these type of videos with try ons!Also love the scarves.Liked them all from the start on your youtube vlogs!
How many times will Pablo Hidalgo have to tell you Gray Jedi dont exist!? Stop perpetuating the myth!
so an unoriginal movie. Star Wars is ruined.I'm out.
the scene between Brienne of Tarth I mean... Phasma and Finn is reminicent of the Revenge of the sith  cover with Anakin striking Obi-wan with his lightsaber inside Darth Vader's face
#teamporg but where is my girl Jessica!?
Porgs and Star Wars fans are words that will never go in a sentence together. EVER.
How did the star go from being cute to unattractive in just 18 months
Jesus! Fuck! What is it with her eyes?
She reminds me a lot of Pearl from Steven Universe.
But what about Luke being placed on the back of the poster? Like all antagonists have been in the posters as far as I know.
Nothing about Phasma and Fin, but all about the Porgs? Are you taking Star Wars not serious? :)
#teamporg\nI hope I don't wind up regretting that.
The fact that they remembered the blast mark is amazing. So much attention to detail.
Where the hell is Chobot?
that prog is going to be annoying
spoiler warning after playing parts from the trailer. im sure anyone who want avoiding spoilers would not have click this any way. but still you made a shitty warning
Got to love myself a little Porg
I agree with Mark Hamill: They have totally fucked up Luke's character,and this trailer seems to be more evidence of that.  Also, they should retitle this Episode 8: Return of the Mary Sue
Chewie is a legend!! where does he fit in all this? are R2 and 3PO going to continue on their dumbass adventures? what about BB8 and the new evil BB9??? also, Phasma..... how sick does she look?!
Great breakdown because you added bits of info you know as a fan already knolagble about the Last Jedi
Je--Jessica? Is that... you? Wow. Star Wars has changed you
What's with Rey's white lightsaber or am I seeing things?
Loving that Vault-Tec top!!
I suspect Kylo is most likely reaching out to either his mom in the present after her base is destroyed, or to Luke in the past (after destroying his school); not to Rey.\n\nMaybe when Luke says: “this isn’t going to go the way you think” he’s either talking to Kylo in the past before he destroys the school, or to Kylo in the present after he comes looking for Rey after Luke sends her away, or even talking to Leia with the force about Kylo; not to Rey.\n\nI highly-suspect that Snoke is talking about Rey’s power while ‘training’ her with torture or whatever, and with the “something truly special” he’s recalling the evil she felt when considering killing Kylo in the last movie - a move on the path to the dark side. And “fulfill your destiny” is maybe the disappointment Snoke has that she didn’t kill Kylo then, who was just the bait/decoy, so he’s commanding her to do it now. \n\nI then suspect that Rey has a change of heart about Kylo when he starts encouraging her to kill him “kill the past” after their familial relation (and her ‘superior’ bloodline) is revealed...I think Snoke wants to use her unrivaled power as a sith and that’s why he had Kylo kill all the young Jedi and concentrate the force onto her. But, with this imbalance of power, “it isn’t going to go the way Snoke thinks”...maybe she’s so powerful after Leia (and possibly Luke) and other force users ‘die’ that she unwittingly drained the force from all of the remaining ones and hence no more Jedi (or siths)...and then the force finds balance another way, perhaps one we’ve never seen. *excited face*
I'm on team Amy.
NERDGASM FOR THE CRYSTAL FOX!!!!!!!
I miss jessica\n\n
this trailer was the final piece that convinced me: star wars is DEAD.
Could Snoke's torturing of Rey be a force dream and not real?
Some of you guys give nerds a bad name. \nWhat does it matter who is presenting? It's the content I'm here for!
Love the trailer, but I hope it's full to the brim of misdirection like the Rogue One trailers. All I'm going to take from this is that it looks COOL!!!!!
Holy shit the blatant disconcerting reading-face she's doing is the most distracting thing I've seen in weeks, and the fact that you had to KEEP CUTTING TO HER RANDOMLY forced me to keep most of the video off the screen at all times because seeing her leaning forward staring at the cue cards/prompter made every word she said turn into those sounds adults made on Peanuts cartoons.\n\nIf you have to bring someone on that can't read without leaning in and making it obvious, at least don't cut to her at random frequent intervals so it's less of a distraction.
A bit dumb and logic jumpy. I think after that scene with the ships giant robot elephants warp in shooting nuclear bananas.... Could happen!
Fuck Jessica\nShe's a thot
I am hyped for Carrie Fisher but it’s going to break my heart, and I want a nude scene with Poe and Finn... but that’s just me...
Amazing, Amy did great, even she has the same gesture of putting the arms behind her back!! 😍 In general she's more cute and Jess more spicy, but anyway, good job!! 😊
is it just me or thi Amy Vorpahl is just too hot!! damn
Bb8 getting zapped from the back of Poe’s Tie Fighter, a nod to R2D2 getting zapped on the back of Luke’s Tie Fighter in Star Wars A New Hope???
#TeamCrystalFox If they're running into the base it's clear they've been domesticated and are being used somehow by the Resistance. For who knows what but they're cool!
Amy, dunno what you did with you hair but it worked. You looking damn fine.
I wonder is Rey was created by Snoke a'la Darth Plagueis with the purpose of mating with Kylo to give rise to the ultimate Force child?
Balanced Jedi are those who rely on the Light side of the Force. Anakin brought balance (restored the natural balance) by destroying the Avatar of the Dark side, Sidious. The Gray was never canon.
I think a BIG detail was missed: Luke's fear!
I love how she pretends to give a fuck about all of this xD
Great job Amy on this episode of Nerdist News!
She talks too fast the first half.  She needs to pace and breathe.  Outside of that, it cracks me up all this crying over Jessica, happens every time she isn't in the video lol
I can't wait for Dec., but seen this new trailer it as the look of a rehash Empire Strikes Back like with The Force Awakens from a New Hope. basically The Empire/New Order & Rebel/Resistance still haven't learn from history. they might have new tech, but still essentially stuck in a loop.
What about the line which Luke says about raw power ?
I bet she has a HUUUGE vagina
We are eternal spiritual beings having a very brief earthly experience.   R.I.P and annihilation are a LIE!! Dont wait until you breathe your last to find this out.  \nhttps://youtu.be/5QqMQNPy2LU\nhttps://youtu.be/p70oyjbKftQ
The grey jedi crap goes against EVERYTHING.
I didn't miss shit!
We are the Porg. Resistance is futile.
#TEAM CHEWBACCA because he is going to eat that stupid porg thing lol
Pablo Hidalgo tweeted MONTHS ago; \nI don't understand all this Grey Jedi talk. It's the light side, the dark side, and that's it. There is no Grey\n\nI foresee ALOT of disappointed theorists in our future. \n\nI guess this is what happens when fans have NOTHING but time between episodes to make predictions and speculation. \n\nI would say, I'm not hating on the people who speculate! but that wouldn't be true. \n\nI'm letting Lucasfilm fill in the blanks for me. As they have since 1977. They created this thing I hold so dear.
Everyone be like, oh can't watch the trailer! Can't spoil it!\n\n\nMe: @nerdist TEAR THAT $*!T APART.
Star Wars: Return of the Mary Sue
Herow Amy!!  Great job :)

Ugh.. Bring back Jessica
Man. I love this channel, but the troop of turds lead by their cocks crying when Jessica isn’t on makes me queasy.
Basically its all white males are now bad.... You know, the majority of the USA... Now has to sit back and let 'minorities' take over to become 'equal' WHEN they wont show the same in countries they come from.... Thats how pathetic people are. Wont help each other in their own country BUT make white people PAY for their 3rd world country immigrants that want free stuff and to blame everyone else for their mistakes in life...... How pathetic.
Why do the US and UK trailers have different middles.. THIS CHRISTMAS or THIS DECEMBER around the 1min 20 mark...
Bring back jessica

Dude I'm loving the mtn bike content!
#harrymainia3
Fuck that was sick
You should go chicksands I went there a few years ago and it was amazing!
Thought I recognised that drop! My mate owns that place, and honestly, I haven't got the balls to touch half the stuff there, it's fucking insane.
The jumps at around 5 minutes were absolutely sick well played mate
What other jump compares to this jump?
I really like these vids keep doing these please 👍🏽
very impressed most people can't do this after years of mountain biking and you've done it on like the 4th time every riding!!!! crazy dude keep it up!!!
fair cop, that 1 hell of a jump
Subscribed and turned on my notifications and was wondering if I could plz have a rocker bmc
Fucken insane \nCan't believe your a mtb noob. Who's else has come over from gmbn ??\n\nAwsome
What a ledge, I haven't got the balls to hit that jump after a year of riding, fair play man.
It is such a pleasure to see a BMXer riding mountain bikes, I reckon Mr Main has it in him to win races.
That shit was sick as fuck.
You bunny hopped off the wood waaaay to to much. You just need a small little bounce to clear it perfectly
Gotta give him credit, only biker fucker on here trying new shit
I'm a Harry main fan now
Hit the 50 to 01 line at the revolution bike park
This video was sick keep it up
Harry your a legend love the vlogs made me just go and build a enduro bike lol wife said for fuck sake your 40 not 14 playing with bike's!!!
Thumbs up from me mate you are a legend
You fucking beast! Killing it!
U need to come queen Elizabeth country park
I think you would like Chatel Bike Park.
Great to see your enthusiasm as you mix in new things- end of the day, it’s riding a bike and can only be good. Question tho- what skills do you think transfer best from BMX and where do you feel you need to make up ground?
Doesn't wear Gear to show his tats off
This is so sick
Do more shit like this!!
Harry main is a huge jackass. Suck a dog dick harry main.
You're a mad man for this!! Keep progressing lad ! 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼🔥
That was fucking sicc! (The jump and overcoming fear.) I agree that humans need some crazy heart pumping every now and then. Good stuff
Get out on the trails with Ratboy and the rest of the 50 01 crew, that'd make some great footage
I acc love these videos plz do more harry 🤙✔️
“Look at that mother fucking jump” made my day Mr Main.\nI’ve subbed
Crazy vid, a go pro stabiliser will help a lot mate
Yes Lad! The massive gap was insane!
The crash starts at 11:18 \n\n\nThank later
Everyone should get up everyday and go and do mad shit \nFuck yes!!! Hahaha
Harry i live near there....theres havok but if u wanna go somewhere free and big like massive. Go lee mill quarry it big and ive been there about 20 times and find sommet new evry time i go
You should come down and ride at woods bike park.
Lad were are you from
You should use your front brake more because its more effective
First of remember to use a go pro stabiliser and don't use a fish eye so then we can't see the real depth of the jumps. Otherwise great video.
he can do that explin a bottle of catsup  under 3secs
Great vid mate . Now that feeling when you stand on the take off lookin at something huge. Feels like you just did a three foot line of coke when you make it . Think you should have done it twice though just to say you beat it.
I like what you did with your hair
You should pop down to north west cycles in cheadle. All the bikes all the kit and most of all great advice.
Harry I believe you should look at investing in a gimble for your GoPro because it is very shaky. Gimble's help with that and it is a lot more stable, and maybe a mic cover for your GoPro. If you would like to talk to me about this dm me on instagram @racerbellchambers
Late squad where you not at ?  \n----- he's trending he's trending lol
Absolute fuckin head case! Proper buzzing seeing you on a mountain bike fella and shredding it ( but most of all loving it also)  you should pop over hales board and bike Park ( it's nothing mental like this but still fun) one quiet weekend,  it's only outside Chester ✌️
Could you tell me where this track is I’ve been looking for a corse for so long?
hey guys I make moutain bike vids too and skiing so go check it out! leave a like and subscribe
We’re is that track???
NEVER MUSIC OVER THE SWEET SOUND OF TIRES, DIRT, HUBS, OR BOTTOMED OUT SUSPENSION!
Cool harry 👊 love the videos keep em coming
Today im going down on my wife, as you can tell.. its pretty wet
Try and use 50%front brake and 50%back brake and let of the brakes gradually as you go around the corners.  It sounds as your skidding a lot. I guess you using the back brake a bit to much? Doing this is making you loose traction so remember 50 50
Love the MTB vids! Keep ut the great work!!
Where are you riding
Is there such thing as a helmet-cam stabilizer? During the technical sections i feel like i'm having a seizure. Would love to see some smooth footage. Otherwise crazy video as always.
You have some fucking balls you just hit every jump
7:53 such a 21 Savage type beat
You need to come down south and ride places like Windhill, Woodys and Black Mountain cycle centre. All incredible bikeparks with big, big lines.
you are way cooler now that you ride downhill
Quit looking at the screen and look at the camera
Harry get one of those go pro mounts where it doesn't wobble as much like this so Harry can see please
Omggggggg so cool bro you re m'y favorite rider because you re thé best 🔥💪
Pills debuted at #1 on the New Alternative 40 Chart this week:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwFx0ROBf7o&index=1&list=PLxlSBzMcrtkMCVtuXEIz5BXpPfycTwsS5
I didn’t see that it said 'audio' so I kept waiting for her to move 😂😂
Cara's voice is good :)
Why does this sound like the pokemon red/blue song 'Guidepost' Love it!
3:08 - the lyrics are very reminiscent of Shine On You Crazy Diamond
I'm not excited by this last material
Cara !!!
Thanks NPR for turing me on to this amazing Artist!
This is like two awesome songs merged into one.
Sup, dudes. I am currently run a blog entitled Come and Share This Jam With Me where I share underrated and simply awesome songs that I love like Pills, and where I also discuss my delightful opinions about them. If you want to check it out follow this link: http://sharethisjam.blogspot.com/2017/10/pills-st-vincent.html or not, that's cool too
The childish melody on the intro and the chorus reminds me a lot of the Pokemon games on the gba
I'm not sure how many know how great Annie Clark really is, but I do, this girl is one of the greats...
Ugh, why so many dislikes.  St. Vincent is amazing and always will be.
Cum to think of it, she has a Jeff Beck vibe guitar tone going on. 😋
I love this so much
time for me to see, my guitar to think
I really hated this song at first.
Brilliant. In every way.
i miss st. vincent, i miss annie clark. digital witness was certainly the harbinger for a departure, but i am afraid, in this departure, there is no lift-off. (my opinion)   2:42 is a saving return-to-form, the rest is so done, so medium. No boundaries pushed, which coming from annie clark, is what I interpret as pandering. que lastima...
Pills pills pills and a big stiff dick pills pills pills
it's crazy that it's been 10 years since I first heard Annie. Been devoted admirer ever since. \nI don't know if anyone else hears this but this is for me is evolution of the kind of stuff Pete Townshend was writing during the Who's Sell Out & Tommy era\nI immediately heard that kind of funny-but-serious approach in the pills to... refrain, and the left-field spiritual slow jam of the ending. That's the Who, right there. I'm loving every second of it. If only John Entwistle was alive to play bass on this shit. Love you Annie 💚🎶🎸🎶💚
The last part sounds like a 90's song we had in Romania, i kept listening to it didn't know why it sounded so familiar. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSqILPaz1KU
does this remind anyone else of the underpants gnomes' song from south park?
pretty good timing for this song considering that the vegas shooter took anti anxiety pills that  drove him to psychosis
I don't even know if that's a bass anymore (what year is this?), but the responsible for it knows his stuff
i love the part Cara sings
The first song, New York...just didn't really do it for me. I love Annie for her insanely idiosyncratic angular approach to songwriting....and that song just didn't tickle my fancy. But seeing her perform Los Ageless on Colbert....and now hearing THIS, I'm now super thrilled for this new album. I mean, she never ever disappoints....and this new albums is looking to be even _more_ eclectic and surreal _and catchy_ than past stuff, and that's saying something. Annie is such a force of nature...what I especially love about her is that she's not only absurdly creative and smart...but she's a bit nuts, maybe more than a bit. That's a very crucial ingredient to making a truly interesting artist, or even just an interesting human being.\n\nPeople like Bjork or Bowie or Prince or Jack White or Michael Jackson....this list is long, although only representing a *_tiny_* fraction of humanity, those sort of artists are what I gravitate toward. People who are not only very talented and informed at songwriting....but who also have a few screws loose; artists who seem very self-confident and mentally sharp, but who also have a noticeable undercurrent of madness lurking beneath the surface. That's an important element of creative thinking and doing...and Annie has it in spades. She's very..._iconic_ to me...and I'm hugely inspired by Annie in making my own music and art.
The breakdown sounds like the Rain down... section from Paranoid Android to me... (a good thing)
the end half reminds me of Marry Me, and whatever happens before that gives me a seizure. I kinda like it. It feels like a solid blend between new and old styles. It reminds me a bit of The Apocalypse Song from Marry Me, and then Your Lips are Red, and then the hook is like a 1960's commercial jingle
Music of this woman is  absolutely Unique !!! 😍 I love it !!!! 😍
This is my happy pill!
Tasty guitar on a delicious track!  YUMMM!!!\nWhen it comes to St. Vincent, I cannot be satiated!
I hate pills but I like this songs.
I like how the song is kind of ambiguous about pills. The ending made me think that the problem isn't pill use -- the problem is the world
Annie bravo <3
that rug is amazing.
The outro has bowie vibes 🖤
Yes
AOTY
I want to hear Mindless Self Indulgence do a cover of this
The beginning of the song sounds like that one Moana song tbh
I wouldn't need any pills to fuck her
Omg she is so sexy. Only girl I'd go gay for
Definitely my favorite so far from the singles released
https://youtu.be/eB-CTk8oimc listen my band please!
I WANT TO MAKE SEXY TIME WITH THIS WOMAN NOW!
It kind of reminds me of Tune Yards
let alone find that kind of vocal range
I hear Pokémon\nI hear Queen\nI hear Bowie\nI hear Pink Floyd\nI hear St. Vincent !!
Wow, love the song! Check out this group Head Noise below too, pretty quirky electro-pop also :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDKts5guMOU
We Happy Few better use this song in their promo... It's literally perfect.
this sucks so bad that im' done with youtube for right now.
Hello! My name is Malik Charles and im really just tryna get support for my music! I write music about Love,pain and life..please take a listen https://youtu.be/JXZgl62f0dA
Ummmm this is so weird. It sounds like an ad St Vincent made. It is terrible and brilliant at the same time. The pills pills pills and a good stiff drink makes me nervous, but she redeems it towards the middle and the end with a classic rock structure. Maybe it'll make sense next to the other tracks.
Awesome song dead on commentary about how screwed up this society is and how we are all puppets of big Pharma.\n\nWhat one thing do all the shooters in all mass shootings have in common? They were all on multiple psychoactive prescribed drugs.
Am I the only one who hears life on mars at 2:50?
Annie, needs to do some work with Jamie Hince
i love this pic for.. reasons
Kind of Vampire Weekend 's vibe at some parts
Anyone else notice that Pink Floyd influence?
chorus is annoying, BUT DEAR GOD THAT SECOND HALF IS AMAZING! seriously that should have been the whole song. felt like modern day pink floyd
The melancholy finish is so Bowie Diamond Dogs/Low.
Not a very subtle message to this song.
I've never felt so ready for an album in my life.
Pills to follow Prof. Oak back to the lab
This song seems like to use for cheerleading or marching
I like this.
On my zillionth listen now!
I'm so freaking hyped!!!!
The outro interpolates ''Everyone You Know Will Go Away'', or the live song she played addressing mental health at David Byrne's show.\n(I am secretly SO happy for that)
I'm enjoying this new direction. It's not as heavy as the older albums. Better they try different directions and styles than stay stagnant trying to please fans who just want the artist to do the same thing again and again. Why can't people take a detour and try something different? Whether it's a different sound, visual or experience. There are always going to be some who stay in the past and are unhappy when artists change and experiment. And so what if St.Vincent wants to try performing on her own or offer a different experience? I'm glad when artists don't stay stuck just to please. Annie is trying something bolder, brighter and clearer. Observing different things now. Still staying true to her guitar. But I do understand sometimes people just don't dig something and that's fair enough. There's a beauty in difference of views and opinion.
I think we are listening an album about a beautiful talented musician girl who joined the high fashion scene and her thoughts about the things she finds ridiculous in it. Its just an idea though so we will see but It is ok beautiful girl, it is ok.. not everyone has the chance you have.. funny song though !
Why have I never fucked on purple carpet before... POWERFUL st Vincent!
me come
I hear Pokémon Red/Blue!
St. Vincent > Queen Bee
Annie is spitting rhymes. Awesome!
love it
Fucking incredible
woooow
Annie❤
Sounds fresh AF.
yawn
Sick
Much better than Los Ageless
Brilliant
ooooh
no disappoint me ever
St.vincent feat.Cara Delevingne
Sorry but it's annoying and generic
Why aren't her new music on vevo?
SHe's a boring person desperately trying to be edgy and avant garde
Firm flop into pop on this album. Lalala fafafa pillspillspills. She used to rock.
Really talented pop composer though, like brilliant ear for melody and tasteful guitar, the music kicks ass. It's just like 'rage against the machine' or some other kind of immature preachy bad self-important lyricism, i can suffer through most of it.
She said fuck
I read somewhere that the Pills chorus has vocals by Cara Delevigne

I've really liked the way this album has sounded so far, but the social commentary has been lack luster. I definitely think you should put it in your music, but what does saying anything about plastic surgery or Fucking pills have to do? Yes there are plenty of people who take pills who don't need them, but I'm disabled and in debilitating pain and I need them to get out of bed. I need pills to wake and sleep and fucking walk AND eat because of stomach issues. Medical science has come a long way and I'm HAPPY for it. This song is catchy but the lyrics are a snooze fest. 😴😴😴😴😴😴
i just nutted

Snowpiercer is my favorite movie, omg it's so under rated
#1: Answer the door. #2: Come upstairs in the cheese costume. Geez, peer pressure much? I would totally tell my bf that, I might get hit in the head for it, but she'd probably accommodate me. She's nice like that. Sometimes. Best friends are meant to torment each other. It's a fact. The fact that they can understand you is a bonus. Domesticity at its finest. Oh and  nice he ordered milkshake(s)....I mean are you even surprised anymore?
When he turns his chair to his left the screen gets more yellow and normal colored, but when he turns to the right the screen goes purple
Dan!  you can use rubbing alcohol, instead of nailpolish remover!
💛We💛love💛you💛Dan💛and💛Phil💛never💛change💛
I had a councillor at school because people took the mic out of my name and the guy didn't even know my name. It made matters worse .
If Dan was my therapist, he'd probably cry alongside me in the corner.
The cheese dress is back
He looks so cute in this
what if the thing in the calendar is going to be a dog ???
Is there somewhere i can donate to from switzerland (not in the eu) ?
Ooo Dan throwing shade at the demons is my new kink
I noticed their voices were slightly lower in the bloopers video and I was very confused!!!
I’m loving the yellow nails 😍
i suffer from anorexia, it is inspiring to hear that people care about mental illness. thank you Dan and Phil for this video. every one blames me that its my fault that I could anorexic but I never asked for this, it just arrived and now it eats away at me making me believe things that are not real. I want to get win and get better but its so hard. video's like this help to encourage people suffering, it gives them hope I guess. it makes them realise that people do care. thanks for the video guys. :)
Am I the only one who's still waiting for the scented candle haul ..
k but how does he blow up the balloon so easily
This is completely unrelated but there was a teacher called mr Howell who started working at my school, let’s just say that phandom in my school didn’t stop
DAN WITH PAINTED NAILS JESUS AMEN SCREE E E  LIKE IF YOU AGREE
this is one of the many reasons I love you <3
aww he was blushing so much when he spoke about phil painting his nails, this is so wholesome
💛🌻💛🧀💛🌞💛
My best friend had depression after being bullied, and I have anxiety. Thanks Dan, this helps to know that you care.
Omg their calendar is gonna be with the Howlter family
but what if you joke about your mental illnesses to help you cope?
Guys I need the name of the anime he recommended is it new yokyo? Help
People I've talked to go on about depression like it's a choice, or like it's some sin, or they think those who are depressed are weak. I try to tell them otherwise, but they go on like they know what it's all about when really, they have no clue.
Out school is shit they told us it was wmhd then just started to shout about attendance for a school trip 🙄🙄🙄😂
omg wait, why didnt i think of this earlier? Dan x Cole, i mean imagine the beautiful babies that they would make
you should do a baking dan vs phil
my bet there is animals in the new calendar
I had such awful experiences with councilers and all my counciling experiences were so strange and didnt feel very comfortable or helpful. If you had the same problem with therapy youre not alone please dont worry. 🖤 Things will be alright.
W H O L E S O M E
Snow piercer took a lesson from Jonathan swift??? 😖
I wish I had a soulmate that would order me a milkshake
I actually got so sad randomly that I almost cried for no reason a few minutes ago. Do I have depression?
Nail polish
*literally grabs anything yellow*
He should try press-on nails.
😶
The nails look hot
....is it tho?

🌝
I liked the part where Kylo Ren tells Rey, Wow you are The Last Jedi. Sorry I killed your dad, Luke Skywalker.
Lol this review is so sarcastic and passive aggressive, and taking shots at literally everyone, but then again your like calm and nice. So I am really confused
I love you, you are amazing
I don't think it's actually mesh under his skin. I think he's just wearing a cool techno bandage. You know, he just has a particular taste in bandages that he thinks is cool.
After spending over a decade living on a desert planet, Rey has to jump into an ocean and swim so she does. She out-swims all of the local sea creatures but on her SECOND attempt, NOT her first because #NotAMarySue
That was surprisingly fun. I kinda enjoy reaction videos (although I always keep in mind that this trend is a tad depressing, sociologically speaking), but yours was one of the rare believable ones I've seen... ^^; Some people are good at it, whatever it is, and some aren't, some have lives, some are men-children with the emotions of five year-old girls. In any case, I like your humor.
I avoided watching this trailer after Johnson's and Hamill's warning. Watching this reaction video somehow feels like a decent compromise between abstaining and watching it. I'm looking forward to seeing Kylo's face mesh in the theater.
The Porg seems to be permanently unhappy. : (
Wow, a real reaction thats not an overreaction, thank you for this Jenny. :)
If Vader was Jenny's dad he'd try to force choke me to death every time he reads my mind because of my impure thoughts towards his daughter..
Oh god all the uncreative RLM comments have migrated....
This is the best.
Funniest reaction video i've seen. Really apathetic and ironic whilst also being a giant piss take of all the reaction vids about. Love it 😂
This is hardly a reaction video
I think it's some sort of bandage. The scar is different later.
Every time Jenny rolls up her sleeves, take a shot.\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, so it only happens a few times. Drinking is bad umkay.
In a bold move to finally tie animated Star Wars to live Star Wars, Disney will make Rey the lovechild of Ezra and Sabine.
Our allegedly strong female lead with the line Just show me my place in all this worries me.  A strong character has goals and at least an idea of the path they want to take.  Rey kinda just bumbled her way through The Force Awakens too.
Is she for real?
Her attractiveness is approaching 5000.
How can she hate Rogue One and be excited for TLJ?
Many it's like a weird looking Band-Aid.
It’s like Ellie’s new tattoo. The ultimate cosplayers got it tattooed lol
I figured it was a cyber-bandage thing of some sort
Biased against the poor Foxes because you don't personally like them?... SMH ;)
You and rich evans have two different opinions on how to use a porg doll.
Is that your daughter's room or do you still live like a 12 year old?
I found I had more of a reaction when I tae a shit then I did when I watched trailer. The 1 thing that the trailer are my movement was alt of urrr, ugh, groan and grrrr's
I want to see a Jenny Nicholson/Red Letter Media cross over.  I think their senses of humor would compliment each other nicely.
The Mesh Thing as you call it, is most likely a Bacta (Star Wars Magic Medicine) patch used for healing wounds on the go, since this movie is supposed to take place right after the last one according to the director. I'm guessing he is feeling like a failure after his loss to Rey and wants to get right back out there in the fight and slaps it on his face instead of going home to lick his wounds for a while. Then by the end of the film, it will come off. Think future face grow back bandaid.
I love all your content, and I think you're awesome! But I'm really writing to tell you know that I think your horse is The true embodiment of Black Beauty from the movie. 😁
I agree with you that trailer reactions are silly , but I mostly think they're stupid
Palpatine was set to wear Golden clothing on the previous movies , dont mock snoke.  didnt you join the SW showmoedown
Oh baby, I'd love you  so much, and post-coital would be a trip to the stars! Plus. I'd like to nibbke your feet
You're trying to say figuratively blind. Watching Archer helps.
Trailer reactions are silly, you are so right. Most of them should be called trailer overreactions.
Last shot of Kylo, could be from the flashback at Jedi academ wood-shop failure. And Kylo stoic? I don't know your humor, was that sarcasm or confusion, cuz everyone calls him emo Kylo. :)
the mesh is a space bandage.
I think it's just a space band-aid on his face
How funny, you are silly, and cute, but a little silly, I think I mentioned that already, not sure I trust those porgs though, what someone else called an egguin, a term I like, but I can't wait to see the movie, mesh scars and all, force be with you.
Jenny, is your left sleeve okay?
I thought it was a space band-aid
i do not do reaction
Your reaction was cool, seriously. But Tyrone Magnus was better ijs
That stuff is not under Kylos skin I don’t think. It looks likes a band aid almost
It's not fun watching someone complain about entertainment
You are so perfect, and I would, still, say that if I could only hear you on the radio,...... or something stupid like that.
who cares if he has a gold robe? What's the big deal? What's to dislike? It may be part of his character development. Who cares. The nitpicking about every little thing is getting to the point that I just can't watch this type of crap anymore. There's NOTHING of value in these videos. Just people doing absolutely nothing, saying absolutely nothing, talking shit about things they'll never come close to accomplishing themselves and so what the fuck is the point? You watched a trailer that we also watched, wow, guess we need a video about it? What's going on in the world? Why are we all choosing entertainment that's duller, less interesting, has less substance and doesn't bring anything new to anything. That's our world today. Watching people watch other videos and then bitch about them. WTF!?
Make a video about  Andy Signore.
I love the Porgs too
If you really want to see cringe reactions in their purest form, type ComicBookCast2 trailer reactions. The guy who does those reactions is like Tommy Wiseau of trailer reactions.
It baffles my mind people watch this...
The scar looks like some Kevlar tape bought from Amazon stuck on his face.
I was a huge fan of the part when the Porg opened up his mask only to reveal another Porg saying, Now, I am The Last Jedi.
I assumed it was a bacti strip to accelerate healing and minimize scarring. If that's the case, then he's obviously wearing it at the beginning of the movie, which is when I think the space battles take place.
If Luke and Anakin can get robot hands that look like normal hands why can't kylo ren get his scar repaired or pull a handsome Jack and have a hologram over it
She is so weird and awkward...yet I still want to bang her.
I HAVE SCREWS IN MY LEG, TOO!!
Yippee, another star wars movie. I can't wait to be disappointed by another average movie hyped to infinity.
Are you underage, why all the fluffy toys?
I can't find last week's millennial falcon. when are you gonna release it Jenny?
The Porg marketing for children is clearly working.
If I wrote the new trilogy I would see the OT events as WW1 and this new one as WW2. The Empire being Nazi Germany. \n\nStar Wars would be like basically what would happen if humanity colonized most of the galaxy 1000 years ago and the the events shown in the movies are the 20th century but set against the whole galaxy background not just earth.
It's not there the whole time.
I'm thinking that's going to be the same question most people will have when they walk out of the theater for ep8, too. Was Rose even in this? On the other hand we probably wont, because no one really cares.
So why did Luke (nor anybody else) not go after the punk and kill or capture him after he killed all the trainees?  Nope.  Luke just turned into a pussy and went into hiding for 30 years? Where were all the ghosts of Yoda, Obi Wan or whatever couldn't have been there to warn Luke when the danger was there?  Was Luke just the only Jedi training and running that center?
I like this video! You do sound more honest than the majority out there, and the part that you laughed because of how Snoke looks made me smile. :)
your poor boyfriend, his eyes must hurt all the time. ;)
Torn between avoiding the trailer and watching this video.\n\n*Finally breaks down and watches this video*
Finally. An honest trailer reaction. I'm glad you didn't cry when you heard Luke speag. Or scream like a porg at the end shot. Or surmise the entire plot from a 2 minute clip of film that might not be in the film.
Your mother has a screw in her leg?  She is more machine now, than mother. Twisted and evil.
I would be very interested to see your analysis of the Steven Moffat era of Doctor Who, if that's something you are familiar with. Although it may be too much of a complete mess to even attempt analyzing...
PLEASE MAKE OUT WITH THE PORG ON YOUR NEXT VIDEO!
The whole flick is a comedy!
You bring back my faith that there still are some normal star wars fans out there. Thank you.
Great video.
Watched 10x before lighting up.
What eats porgs?
*gasp
That Kylo ren  doll is creepy af
Eff the redemption arc. Kylo gots to die.
Reaction starts at Never:Clickbait
LOL
I love you.
#PorgLife
I didnt know they made Porg vibrators.
Mark Hamill resents your comments about face reconstruction.
You are special 💗
It kinda doesn't work to criticize trailer reactions while running with a Droopy-the-dog schtick as pretentious as this. Just putting that out there.
Other people are having fun in ways I disapprove of. You should only have fun in the same way I do.
You think I look funny? HARD TO TAKE SERIOUSLY!!!!! WHAT!!!!!!!! although I have to thank you for calling me fashion forward I do like my Gold Robe but I'm supremely intimidating I'm not funny other than that this amused me
No, I definitely do not need this.... sorry. But your command of the obvious is really firm.
Mr Sunday Movies does this better.
No. The last shot is a flashback. And that fire behind him matches up with the scene where Luke is digging himself out of the rubble.
God I can’t stand this girl
God I hate you
Also quit Shitting on trailer reactions. People like the crew at Blind Wave, for instance,  work very hard on their content, know their stuff, are intelligent, and their responses show this. People want to see fans like THEM react to things they are equally fans of, as well as hear their subsequent opinons on the matter. Your invalidation of this is very narrow.
I clapped when I looked at the comment section and everyone said they clapped, because I know that reference too!
hmm...mighta been best that this video wasn't done.  But then I did enjoy the Kylo Ren with Rey shirt on.
I'm so sorry to admit this, but I fap to Jenny all the time.
The truth still lies in the X-Files, Mulder.
step from one moderate sample regarding dry seemingly answer.
This is The X-Files 11th season... and my penis is 11 inches long. COINCIDENCE?!?!?!
Lol does  FOX know that the theme song is the Illuminati song on the internet
The little aliens are getting cuter. So cute.
Agent Scully's still hot.
im a little busy taking a knee, so probably cant watch
Season 10 was real bad, though.

Been waiting 4 this for a long time...
The show has become so absurd and dreadful in a 'mad scientist slowly losing his mind' sort of way.
The older David Duchovny becomes the more he starts looking like Walter Matthau :)
Looks like Krycek is the only person that's not returning from the dead this season.
where is the noire? :c
this season will be showed on tv in 1 year 1 is the first number number contains 6 letters 6 - 1 is 5. 5 + 5 is 10. 10 team 10 jake paul \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx files jake paul confiermeeeeeeeeeuuued

Is this real??? I hope so.
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCExlDzW366rQSj9mOTz4tBw
I only watched the first couple of seasons. I liked it more when each show was more of a one off.
Oh no it looks bad
This looks terrible.
Scully ages like a fine wine! What is she eating or drinking?? Lol
First off didn't the Morley man get blown the fuck up in a cave after being shown with a tracheotomy? Second off please no more honky tonk budonkadonk, ever.
PHEW .... can breathe again there is another series ..... thank you!
Didn't all the Lone Gunmen die? Well I guess so did the CSM so anything is possible. I'm super stoked.
Note to self: buy another carton of Morley's....
Hopefully they run into Fringe Division.
People of earth and this must be connected.
Now just make season four of millennium
Every time someone says Agent Einstein' it sounds like sarcasm. Hope this season is better.
and rain pours down in vancouver, ha ha ha
Scully dies at the end of this season
no lot call officially makeup throat rub mayor pig talented wisdom.
British guideline matter bfhwl succeed own hungry landing both prime.
I don't like this, Skinner meeting with CSM.
The trailer looks amazing! So looking forward to season 11!
I would give it an extra thumb up for using a cover of Zombie in the background, that song was definitely in my 90’s soundtrack, I would sing it over and over again back then. Also... do they want to tell us something with that song? It’s all in their heads?
No more of those younger agents PLEASE! They were annoying and charismaless af.
Awe man! It's on! Can't wait
I loved that they brought the series back but it's almost it's own parody with some episodes. It's not dark like it was in the past. The fish man episode with the fake sex scene with Agent Scully really turned me off too last season. I mean when have they ever done anything like that with her character???
They all look great! Wow
That theme song never gets old.
makes me wanna take a knee
the rabbit hole just got a lot deeper than expected
Don't these two people hate each other in real life?
The X-Files, guaranteed to have more facts than fox news.
I love everything I just saw....everything...even the fact that they showed the same cut of Mulder looking around a corner twice to fill out the trailer.....
I’m the only one who’s watching this over and over again?
What cover of Zombie is that in the trailer? Should be a federal law to provide that lmao.
*HOLY SHIT THAT INTRO SENDS CHILL DOWN MY SPINE*
If Mulder and Scully were real people they would have gone insane by now from everything they've experienced in The X files but there not real people so who care's, they almost die in nearly every episode but they carry on 'Where are we going too this week Mulder?'
Love how both of you took a knee to support the NFL protest... JK you're dead to me now I destroyed my XFiles DVDs. I loved that show but seeing you two sell out like that.
0:47 stop right there I'm in \nI need friends
Uh huh, taking a knee, too, I almost don't want to watch. They don't realize how incredibly lucky they are to live in a country where you can get as stinking rich as these two, oh wait, she doesn't live here. Fuck off Anderson. Stick to movies. Besides, is she taking a knee against all the terror in Londonistan? I didn't think so.
Finally more x-files.. the wait was to long..
WTF

Too bad the actors knelt in support of athletes who publicly disrespected the Flag.    If I boycott the NFL for spitting on the graves and sacrifices of our service members, then I boycott a show that I have watched since day one.  Too bad, it literally was one of my favorite shows.  Since day one.  If you want to protest, do not do it supporting the desecration of our Flag and Anthem, especially when it is based on lies and you are protesting the wrong people.
Does someone know the song? Or is it a new cover for the trailer?

When he started dancing 😂😂

Yeah she differently caught that cold from preschool it seems like my daughter has had a different one every week and she only started a month ago her first week she had one and I'm sure it was that little boy with that runny nose!

Amalah never did answer the question about the boys names!!!🤣🤣🤣
My daughter is in preK this year--she's one of 3 girls in a class of about 12-15. Yup, that's 3 girls and 9-12 boys. Her besties are all boys. Only down side is them teaching her to root for the wrong team--she came home today cheering for the Buckeyes when we're a Bobcat family! Austie [Austin] taught me that is apparently enough explanation. LOL.
Not the superhero we deserve but the one we needed
So disapointed. Was in the metro with a bicycle, waiting for Super Kind Girl to appear. She never came. 😭😭😭😭
This is my favorite one haha poor Anna cleaning at the end
California is going to become the meme and anime state soon
Mike Diva is a genius.
LA is so extra I love it.
日本関係ねぇじゃんwww
Is this PC Music?
Anna is so cute omg
Now do one for those a-holes who stand right outside the train doors and try to get on without letting people off. Basic elevator/subway etiquette, people! heh
These ads are creative af. Most unexpected and wonderfully executed! 10/10
this is a superhero we need
Oh, Mika and Anna. Never change.
Wooow Excellent job Metro!\nfinally a message that encourages respect for passengers and defends them from other rude passengers. There is no courtesy or kindness in many people in the public transportation system, and it is not an exaggeration but, yes, they behave like monsters.
I LOVED THIS. Mike & Anna are awesome.
I wish we could have that in France !! Ahah I love it !
My new favorite anime !
well actually 除害 is correct not 除外..
Super Kind needs to wait until everyone is off the train before barging in.
Is this Hannah Diamond in disguise
More California/Japan fusion! SuperKind is the best. More please! And T-Shirts!
I love Superkind videos, make more! ...and do Full, long songs of already created. Pls ;)
train and bus in Japan, also, SuperKind is needed.
Dude wha's this for?  Anyway I love this super crazy n cool KAWAII ;)
this is a milestone for modern culture
I want the beam she can use.
And we continue to stigmatize bicyclists. Super kind should have used her words and found out why the eyeball monster wasn't standing clear of the aisle. Even eyeball monsters like to go with the flow, unfortunately sometimes there are situations that interfere. This PSA is a misguided social pressure call to action, how about stigmatizing the people that stand where the bikes are supposed to go?
So much better than most music videos!
超親切のダサさは異常
Nice
LOL this got to russian news headliners
Mike Diva making the world a better place by bringing artistic integrity to ice cream ads and PSAs
I would totally buy a pre-transformation Super Kind t-shirt.
Where can I buy my Super Kind shirts and other merchandise? This is brilliant.
The next clip in Moscow
え、何で日本語なの？\n皆分かるの？
que dice la supa kain cuando mira al rude dude ?? jaja no cacho unaxDD
日本..
Lol
Aesthetics
heheheheheh))))
Bahahaha ❤️ this
I love Mike diva stuff
Omfg that end!!!
ANNA IS QUEEN!!!
k...
Convinced me.
wtf, i'm japanese, so i can't understand what happen in this commercial video XD\nbut this dim metro and pop girl contrast is actually too fun!!\n日本のイメージってこんなんなの・・・・\nまぁ良いか、テンタメの都ロサンゼルスだし。\n俺がグリフィス天文台からホテルの帰りにこの地下鉄乗ったときは、黒人の兄ちゃんが箱にお菓子入れて売り歩いてたなぁ\n駅も車内も薄暗くて、人もまばらだから余計このポップなCMが浮いてるというか・・・ｗ
Never in Russia
Why is it in Japanese?
Only a nobody walks in L.A. public transportation is a mobile apt. For the schizo-homeless
I don't think you understand the people you're trying to target with these ads.
I do think its weird that you have Spanish announcements in the US. Doesn't it make sense that people speak a country's first language when they want to live there?
Why it is in Japanese?
I wanna do her
No surprise it's a man because women are never rude and inconsiderate.
OMG THAT FIRST VIDEO JOSH PLAYED THO 😂😭😂

Josh: I thought Joe and Josh would come back and help me with the balloons but no. They use to do it for Caspar but I guess not for me.\n(Probably not the correct wording but omg that is soooo sad, poor Josh)\n😂😂😂
*Grant sounded like the new planet of the apes movie*

12/10/17 - #45 ON TRENDING !?!? lol this trending because of Harvey? lol
waaaaay fuck weinstein pizzagate is real boiiiis
What are your thoughts on Mike Ditka's comments?
And it's been a lot longer than 100 years that they haven't been oppressed
There it is again.....what did black people build in this country? Can someone PLEASE tell me what black people have built in this country?
ESPN is just a Leftist American People Hating Network.\nI will no longer watch them. ESPN is Just a bunch of Race Baiting Leftist Commies.
I'm not white!!!!!!!
you guys so full of shit
Bla Bla bla. Someone get this black man a tissue. Drama drama drama. Blacks these days are such babies. The crying, belly aching and hitting everyone with the race stamp. Fuck your race. Your race is the least interesting race on the planet. You have no race, gangstas, rappers, ebonics and Crack heads. This is why blacks are over the top drama queens. Everything they are about, is fake. Boring as hell. The few blacks that are great people forget they are black and are reminded by the most low self esteemed bottom dwellers on the planet. Yes you kanya. I had to look up your name because it's not worth remembering.
Well, like Delanie Walker told fans...BYE !! It's too late to attempt to bring fans back, with fake patriotism. We don't buy it. You're not oppressed, your immature. You're not heroes to us, the men and women wearing the flag are. We look up to them, but aren't looking at you at all. You turn your back on the country that gives you everything, well we turn our backs on the league that gives back nothing. While you took your knee, we took our stand.
Does my guy know that 100 years would take him back to 1917?..............How are these guys allowed to even say such dumb shit
Hey look!  The liberal media hating on an old white man again!  Say it isn't so!
How did the two Black men get through all the oppression and arrive to where they are? \nEither they got there on the merit of their true qualifications or it was afforded them by Affirmative Action and Civil rights.\nIf it was by the two latter then they are examples of reverse discrimination and was given an unearned gift at a more qualified competitors expense. CONGRATULATIONS if they achieved success by true qualification and merit and not by racial preference, and they would be evidence of what can be done through merit.\nCharacter rather than skin color said someone.\nWorking for success is time consuming and not easy, having it given for racial preference is much easier but it is not an achievement.
Geez did Dikita not know why all those people were being assassinated in the 60's??
Ditka, I can’t believe you said that after The Fridge, Payton, Singleterry and the rest of those Black intellectual human beings made you famous.  You sucked as a player and a coach.  They won the games and you received the credit!!!!!!!!!!
@Travis Simon, I have no beef with you bruh cause ur black, but i can show ur wet and soft looking ass , that i will bring it to you live if you really want it. Keep playing like this shit is a joke if you want to....
Fuck Mike and fyi I bought your game as a kid and in the voice of the rock it was a hot peace of dog shit
Max is passionate about fairness...Mike Ditka is another 50's guy, he has no clue...and I agree with the person who said Buddy Ryan was the true coach of that team in '85...Ditka is as clueless as our president,    keep on justasinger54
I'm right and if you disagree then you're ignorant and racist. Fascist liberal logic 101. Sorry, I have no sympathy for black power saluting America was never great felons. Burn in Hell NFL!
Is this white guy , a historian ?
Ditka needs to start his own Confederate team.  We are over 75% of the league so he needs to take the part of the 25% who might have his mindset and start his league, (he probably would get enough to start league of 4 or 5 players.
The NFL is done. FUCK THE NFL!
FUCK MIKE DITKA, he's an asshole now, always has been, and always will be. \nSigned, \nEducated white boy
ditka's o'l ass needs 2 SHUT UP AN (WHEEL HIS O'L ASS AROUND IN THA NURSING HOME AN  JUST LOOK AT THE YOUNG PRETTY NURSES AN SEE IF( I SAID IF HE CAN GET A  RISE OR GET IT UP)!  AKA 'SHUT-UP BITCH
I think it's ridiculous that Stephen A Smith is so ignorant that he feels he can make his own comments and feel his own way about an issue but yet if someone disagrees with them then automatically he starts throwing the hate bag at them. It's just the most blatant display of ignorance you can possibly see
Ditka is a fool but the young black men of Chicago have made it a war zone. They need to grow and take responsibility for their lives. Until that happens how can you blame everyone else for your problems?
It's alright for Stephen A to spread racist but fired Mike Ditka for telling the truth that's why I don't watch ESPN the racist network
Ditka: There's been no oppression, that I know of, in the last 100 years.\nUSA:   Uhhhhh.... what was that, Mike?\nDitka: Let me clarify: There's been no oppression, that's happened to me, in the last 100 years.\n             I'm really 100 years old. My bad.
Mike Ditka is a draft-dodging POS.  Just fucking die old man.
Why in the world would any Black American protest the Symbol and Anthem of the AMERICA That Saved them from Slavery. America saved you!!! \nREAD IT:\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\n\nWhat you just read is the foundational message from AMERICA to all Blacks.\nIt just took the White folk a 100 years or so to submit to Americas Message of Freedom and Liberty.\nBy Protesting Americas Anthem your are Protesting against the one who SAVED YOU AND GAVE YOU FREEDOM.
Mike Ditka is just plain wrong. Too bad because I used to like the guy. Denying something is not going to solve the problem. The people in sports, that are attempting to bring awareness about a problem in America, are putting thier jobs and future on the line. They want America to be better. People like Ditka want it to be like it was.
Remember the good ole days when ESPN only showed highlights and sports contests? Let's make ESPN great again too
He hasn't been alive for 100 years. see that's that bs
race problems in America Whites hate blacks blacks hate whites. When will it ever end.
Wow, Max went all in.  Steven A. folds again.
maybe he means cfl ... canadian football ... not africa lol...
I never liked Mike Ditka.  He's always been an arrogant old racist bigoted nutcase.
Duh Bears!
Max for President!
Ditka looks like a dirty nazi
Racist minorities always make false accusations of racism and oppression in order to GET something for free, or get AWAY WITH something scott free.  \n\nIt's always about GETTING, or getting away WITH, on the false premise of revenge for slavery.\n\nSlavery will always be the excuse for it, and anyone who resists the LIE will be falsely labeled as a Nazi racist KKK cracker.
It's The Truth all of you GO BACK TO AFRICA YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE RACE MIXING IS WRONG JUST ASK CASHES CLAY BIRDS OF A FEATHER.
End Affirmative Action and turn off Obama's schilling ESPN
ditka is a product of the racist rape factory, ped state \n\nputting a microphone in front of him is like interviewing a racist steak
first give Mike D credit for telling how he n others ignorant ,,dog smelling pig skin racist feel,,,now that's a racist comment ,,,but this what's got to stop,,it's not ment for every Caucasian ,,but only for the ignorant,,that the Elite created,,an it's time for ppl to wake up ,,,an realize who put it in affect,,,to keep ppl at odds,,,when weather gets bad,,everyone trying to help each other ,,which is how it should be,,because the system is worser than the weather!!
More liberal narrative....'racism is evrywhere'...'Trump is bad'....all to keep the black voters from jumping ship...sad ,blacks complain of oppression yet keep voting for the party that has done nothing for them
Hell, the bears have been oppressed the last 32 years. What is he talking about?
MIKE DICK is a fucking ignorant old fashion fart that's stuck in the 50s an is never gonna get it period
protesting the national anthem and our flag is the wrong way to go about what is being sought. Arlington National Cemetery is full of soldiers graves, Black and White, at least give them their due, we owe them.
We just had the first black president and he sucked ass so now all the blacks are pissed off at Trump. Obama couldnt even come close to reducing the 1/3 of black males who go to prison. Your black race is way behind in maturity and is not ready to lead a civilized country period end of story. This isnt a football game or a basketball game this is serious shit where we have enemies with nuclear bombs and terrorists. This shit is a joke we have athletes now who think they know how best to run a country. This is not the time for social experiments.
Ditka is representative of all the white people who still deny racism exists.\nIt's not that they really believe such garbage, it's that they are afraid that if they ADMIT there is a problem, that they will end up losing their privilege.\nThey would rather continue denying the truth so long as they are never forced to do anything about it.
It just shows that Mike Ditka is a ignorant ex football player/coach that's a racist. Plz keep standing and say racist shit so we know who u honky's are. If I was friends with him as a black man our relation would be over
Can't Have The Racist History without its DISCIPLES
kellerman is a liberal clown who always plays the bitch card and agrees with everything SAS says
Holy fuck I don’t like the kneeling during the national anthem but no oppression in the last 100 years? That’s fucking crazy.
we at espn think mike ditka uses 'classic kkk language', what do you think? well espn i think you can go fuck yourselves
Man Trump is letting all our heros come out the racist closet
Martin Luther King, a preacher who preached non-violence, was murdered 49 years ago. A man in his 40s was alive when his peers & parents were actively committing terrorism in the name of racism. This is the dumbest most racist & idiotic shit I've heard since this morning reading Trump tweets.
When did First Take become CNN/FOX News? Smh.
Kneeling Niggers Will Not Succeed.....
Black ppl aren't OPPRESSED!!! TF? We have plenty of rights and can do whatever we want
Fuck Mike Dicka...always knew he was a Racist. Fuck him!!!
Mike just needs to die please Mike die you piece of shit and let me know we're he is buried so I can piss on his grave die Mike die Mike!
I *was* a Packer Backer but now I LOVE MIKE DITKA.  At least he's got courage and conviction and he stands up to the pantie waist cry babies who turned a great game political.\nNFL can all stop playing for all I care, I won't watch.
Typical ignorant rich white guy. Your time is over guys, you generation is getting old and dying off. Just go off into the sunset you willfully ignorant fools.
I, at one time loved ESPN, Mike and Mike was my favorite all time sports show on radio and TV.  I even liked Stephen A. and Skip B.  ESPN has become the CNN of sports talk media.  Cancelling my Direct TV today.  Will never watch ESPN again. (Espn don't want whiteys support or viewership), WISH GRANTED.  Pretty much done with the NFL.
They say the kneeGro don't READ lets see....\nSome one tweet Stephen House kneeGro Smith Please! \nBrotha WAKE up and stop serving Cesare Borgia(so called Christ you see everywhere)!!! you like MANY OTHERS of your Nation are seduced by doctrines of men!!! (Matthew 15:9)\nWE ARE THE WALKING DEAD!!!! \nPROVERBS 21:16 \nThe man that wandereth out of the way of understanding\nshall remain in the congregation of the dead.\nUNDERSTAND AND STOP ACCEPTING WHAT MASSA CALLS AND GAVE YOU!\nPLEASE STOP we are not Black (look in crayon box) not Afro-American (hair style)\nAfrican -American(named after 2 so called whites Scipio Africanus/Amerigo Vespucci) Negro(=black latin=niger) Colored (LOL enuff said!)

You don't like it ?  Leave the country?    There is a reason that those words are said time and time again.    The main reason is that people knows that those words hurts.    If you show someone your weakness then they will attack it.     If you stop worrying about what a football coach says and start worrying about providing for your family then the world will be a better place.     Sticks and Stones can break my bones but words will never hurt me.    White folks know how to push buttons because everyone who isn't White gets buttsore over words.   Call a White Man any name under the Sun and he will probably laugh about it,  call a black man a reggin niknits and all hell breaks loose.      Sticks and Stones will hurt a lot worse than being called a cracker.   Lol Has anybody ever gotten mad at being called a cracker.    Go to a black section of town and yell out  How are Y'all Porch Monkeys doing ?   and see if you don't get beat to a pulp.   Go to the White section of town and Yell Out  How are Y'all Honkeys doing?       Black,  Hispanic, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese. .... all of you people need to get more clever with your name calling because I know Y'all can do way better.    Look at how creative Black Men are with music. ......surely someone can come up with something better than  Cracker    .     White Folks don't get mad when you call us names.
I totally agree with Steven A, and I am from Chicago and I am a huge Ditka fan but this ignorance really hurts the mind.  Sorry Ditka but if your mindset is that far out of wack then I cannot support you.
Ro Fu your a fool has nothing to do with communism or capital has to do with basic human rights which you clearly missed. Kneeling before the flag doesn't disrespect it in any way. Many times people kneel in prayer or reverence. However when Kap or all these other player kneel they want you and these other people to take notice. Rather than sit down kneeling is a way to show respect but still protest. It's amazing that a act this simple doesn't affect the game at all could be such a problem. He and others clearly said they don't hate this country or the army. This issue with the flag seems to have triggered people like you but that is not our message it is  that we don't like the direction our country is headed.  No one seems to speak anymore thanks to your president Donald that we want cop killing to stop ! COPS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SHOOT SOMEONE AND JUST GET A SLAP ON THE WRIST WHITE OR BLACK. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FLAG YOU ALL ARE BEING FOOLED TRUMP IS TRYING TO DISTRACT EVERYONE FROM THE REAL ISSUES. HE IS TRYING TO DIVIDE THIS NATION AND YOU GUYS ARE LETTING HIM WIN. It's sad truly it is
JOE NAMATH SUPPORTS NFL PROTESTS, COLIN KAEPERNICK & PLAYERS\nhttp://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?noframes;read=85357\nGET THE WHOLE STORY
The flag is a symbol of a country where non violent protest is a basic freedom. To protest honors the flag. Strategically I think protests during the anthem are wrong because the protest becomes the issue instead opening up a national discussion about police over reach.
A racist old white guy...what else is new.
Mike Ditka was 21 in the 1960s when the Civil Rights Act passed\n\n\nGeeh...I wonder what he thought about the Act.
Steven a should let max his skin lol he's more of a Blackman than Steven a
I saw those comments in my local tabloid and my jaw hit the floor.  I wonder if Ditka really knows how ignorant he came off.
Besides white, who is, Mike Ditka, and the people, who share his views?
What Mike Ditka thinks is actually irrelevant. Look at that dinosaur. He's him and his moronic way of thinking are going to be long gone very soon
national anthem was written by a Slave owner,  thats Talks of killing slaves tryna be free...
Don't play the national anthem at all.  Play the game.  Shut down the protest and Trumps tirade
Wht ppl look for opportunities to escalate it
I'm of the opinion max needs his own show on espn, and allowed to say what ever he feels. He is incredibly articulate and intelligent and seems to honestly love sports.
We need to wipe the history books of slavery, if  African Americans never knew they were slaves then they couldn't blame the white devil for all their problems.
Fat, old, stupid, racist same as Trump.
I am not surprised by Mike Ditka
United States President Donald John Trump: Talks tough, through tong twisted terminologies. Taking back America; Make America great again; 'Those disrespecting our country and disrespecting our flag.' Really? What country? What and whose flag? There is no American flag.

Unfortunately a large chunk of the population agrees with Ditka and thinks he's 100% right. Civil war, Civil rights, voting rights, segregation, Jim Crow all hullabaloo about nothing.
Someone explain peonage to this clown Ditka... blacks have literally been enslaved within the last 70 years let alone 100..
You mean the same Mike Ditka that predicted Trump to be President, and you idiots are still butthurt! You are a fool to say anything against Ditka, he's in the hall of fame and you guys are? Insignifigant morons! Get of the slavery bullshit! Really? The dems are yhe original supporters of slavery and oppression and jim crowe you idiots! There was no slavery in the 60's dumbass!
Max u did it?!! Awesome job👍🏾👏🏾👏🏾 I’m proud to be an American now.😉
Can we get over this yet?
He hasn't seen oppression in a Century? One how old is he and two. Your rich and white and still have a fan base. You shouldn't see oppression unless you got lost in the wrong side of town.\n Furthermore Ditka grew up during a very turbulent time did he not watch Television in the 60s?\n He is attempting to still be relevant just like comrade pony tail. They should do a movie together like bucket list but called kick the bucket already.\n DITKA IS A CUCKOLD, I retract that statement so it's like it never happened, right?
Ditka's brain is a grapefruit.
Hes a racist fuck
Full of crap
Fuk Mike Ditka dumb ass
Fuck Mike ditka
Max Kellerman is a white cuck
FUCK  NFL.
BOYCOTT NFL
Niggers smell like shit
Shame on Mike Dicka
Thanks u fucking idiots. Because you supported, defended and bought microtransations we now have loot boxes. Good job not playing your games. You paid $60 already, why the fuck u paying for stuff in the game when u can just play and unlock it?
Dunkey was right in his e3 video, EA was going to find some way to fuck this game up
All this crap began with Mass Effect 3.
There is no point in buying a game that works like a free to play game, buy something else or start playing free to play games. This is the same as a free to play game but you have to pay for it because it's star wars. I did not buy the first battlefront, not going to buy this either. I like star wars but i'm not paying for that.
I hate piracy but sometimes secretly I want Skidrow/3DM like people to crack the hell of these type of games...fuck this bullshit
Just pirate it. Thats what i do to any game with micro's l, shadow of war wasnt even worth it though shit game
I'm so glad I don't like these kind of games  ;)
That’s like saying overwatch is p2w. You can earn the loot boxes for free
Why does dice need to hire another company for space battles when they did air to air combat perfectly in battlefields 3 and 4 and 1 like what????
150 days, almost  a half year game played, to get all those weapons, jesus what the fuck
Couldn't I just keep joining  games and afk for the credit
Don't buy this shit... really!\n\nThe only ones who have a good time are the share holders. Look at the EA shares over the last 10 years - it works!\n\nPeople are dumb as shit our days...\n\nFuck this game.
But? dont you buy these fuckers with In Game money? So if you're good at the game you get loot?
Don't get me wrong I hate micro transactions but it is either micro transactions or buyable dlc
Loot box system has been fixed in a way guys! Weapons are now earned by playing with that class and you can only earn the highest level star cards by completing challenges. So that's a good fix in my eyes.
I'm boycotting this game by not buying it. I'm doing my part.
Lots of paid shills in the comments watch out.
Wait EA is milking its customers again!?!?!? No way, they would never do that!!! smh
Loot boxes sucks, but the system where it doesnt matter how well you do is fubar, not buying this shit
This need to stop!! We need to show developers that we don't accept this! Don't buy the game and don't buy the loot creates!! And the will remove it to save there game... simple
if u want a great star wars game, play republic commando's
This an urgent message to everyone in the Angry Army. You need to boycott Battlefront 2 at all costs by any means possible (canceling pre-orders, just not buying the game, etc.). The time is now everybody. We have take action or else we will be forced to submit to the Loot Crate's power.
The problem with this game is they to cater to the shitty ass COD players who are whiny bitches that have 0 skill and are unable to play as a team.
this is today's games. Full of crappy dlc from last gen. Now we have loot crate from mobiles. what's next, I wonder. In a 10 year period, this online game would become useless and a toaster. The servers are dead which meaning these games will become disc freebee. I'm going back and play retro. At least those games don't give these bunch of bs back then.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Even when Ea offers free dlc they still fuck the consumer. The game is fine but after playing the beta it put me to sleep tbh
60 dolars ? ...just wait , like bf 1 ...the idiots wanted 130 euros on it ... youre fucking nuts ? how to spent so much money on a fucking game ? i kept the bf 4 and refused to buy it even when it was on sale , like 40 euros ... , well they dont get my money so easy :)
Oh, well. Why do we even care?\nThere is so many good games out there that are worthed talking about,\nand we're here giving attention to cash grabs that deserve none.
R.I.P Online console gaming your progression systems are crookery and only benefit players who foolishly buy into micro trans. GG IT'S BEEN FUN.
Call for a boycott
Aye angry joe, EA StarWars said credits were capped at 180 and progression was slowed. How are you about to dog on this game when it’s a sample beta ? Tf.
i swear if the game is like this i will go back to the 2005 Battlefront and stay thier for life.
Another channel credited you which lead we here. 👏
The fact this video has 2k dislikes, shows there are that many people who are retarded and support this loot crate bullshit, god I hate people.
EA, you fucked it up!\n$99.99 will get you 12,000 Crystals, this equals 11 Loot boxes for 1,100 Crystals each.\n(ingame prices for loot boxes may change for the release, but I don't except this to happen)\nI will boycott this shit and recommend cancelling Pre Orders.\nIf crackers can't destroy the gaming industry, the publishers will do!
I'm done. Not only am I not buying this game, but I am never going to buy another AAA video game ever again. At this point, I'd feel dirty giving them my money.
micro-transactions are the future of games. They just make to much damn money i mean look at GTAV lol
Have people forgotten about TinierMe on facebook? That game had the gatcha system which is pretty much loot boxes but instead of a box its one of those things that you put a coin in and get a prize in those plastic canisters. Well that game was removed because the Gatchas were considered Gabbling and kids were getting addicted to buying these things. One day I logged in only to see the game has been taken out and the info I got on why was because of this. The Gatchas were considered gabbling. The Gatchas are literally lootboxes. Why the fuck is ESRB not considering these loot boxes gambling.
It is the fad of the industry of gaming. Everyone does it to survive, almost. Or because they're greedyCREATIONCLUB.
How tragic that a game that did something different in a market spammed with FPS games, only ruined by these loot crates, i'm assuming this was EA's idea.
In 2020 you will have to wait 30 minutes to play between one match and another, or buy some god damn gems!!!
joe, i doubt you should be worried about multitransactions, because the government is now looking into multitransactions as a anti-trust issue now, and they're fixing to reach a decision what actions they should taker on them at any time now
Lootboxes destroys the VIBE of gaming. Legendary or Epic Items & Weapon Skins in a freaking box behind a paywall smh. \nRemember in MW3 when you got dat Gold camo? Right, you payed NOTHING. You got the last and best camo because you PLAYED it. You played it with your actual SKILL.
Federal Government needs to step in and address this shit, its gambling pure and simple. Yong Yea said it best, that its exploiting peoples ignorance and human tendencies/weaknesses. KIDS will be buying this just because its star wars and they will buy these loot boxes because they are KIDS and they don't know any better.
Those loot crates just break the heart.
Already cancel my pre order after the beta. So looks like once again I will not be playing this series.
This is the sort of shit that's going to drive people away from gaming and cause the gaming market to crash. I'm more or less quit. I just spend my time playing my guitar. You know what my guitar doesn't do to me? MICROTRANSACTIONS.
This is exactly the reason why I hate multiplayer games with a passion....if you have the money, you win...if you don't, well, I guess prepare for abuse from the rich ppl....I like the comparison he made with Overwatch, as in that game, the only stuff you get from loot crates are purely cosmetic, so if you want a nice skin, or pose, or voice line, you can have it, but it won't have an effect on your in game prowess......you don't get more powerful weapons from them...and I guess ppl still find progression in these types of games too, since Overwatch, Heroes of the Storm, League and DOTA2 are still massivily popular games.
I'm probably gonna buy this game. Maybe on sale. But I'm not paying for anything other than the game itself. Gonna wait for a review just in case tho.
This is why I do not have bazylion $$$. Firstly I was nobody is stupid to pay $$ for DLC which has nothing miningfull in it. Wrong. Now I was nobody will buy this loot boxes in AAA game ... . WRONG again. To much faith in humanity in me. Do not know why :/
i was thinking of getting back into my ps4.. but this is ridiculous ill stick to Jesus. He wnt charge me loot crates
Idk why AAA games are trying to replicate F2P game on a mobile device...
Hey Joe? Have you played Divinity Original Sin 2? It really struck me as something you would really enjoy
they said they capped it at 180 during the beta so progression is gonna go by a lot smoother hopefully
I'll be selling a bot that will keep your character entering new games. That way you can grind while playing a better game.
this type of shit is why I haven't bought a game published by EA since bf4.  EA burn in hell fuckers.
Ya can't spell steal without EA...
What to do about it?? DONT BUY THE FUCKING GAME
Tnx for the info Joe... im gonna avoid this pay to win crap like plague!!! XD
The real tragedy is that this game is actually quite good, and it makes this loot-box bullshit all the more painful.\n\nBut then again, people say Rainbow Six isn't P2W even though you have to sink either dozens of hours to buy a single operator, or, *you guessed it* ; cough up the fucking dough.\nAnd yes, paying for an operator who just hit live servers and is therefore imbalanced, is just as bad as paying money to get a starcard in this game.
Lol.. stop whining and get a job\nwho cares about lootboxes?\nill just buy them. stop being a poor loser
The fuck!! There's RNG on top of the micro transactions along with stats changes for guns!! \nFuck EA.... I've wasted my money on Battlefield 1. I refuse to waste more. Food and clothes are more satisfying.
The background music in the game menu towards the end of the video is so fitting for what Joe is talking about Lol.
I blame the person that buys the micro transactions with real currency.
There is a reason that classic games don't have micro transactions and loot crates. Imagine Mario 64 with unlockable jumps and hats.
Damn 65 dollars isn't enough this shit is getting out of control and too expensive, stop ruining our video games
Overwatch killed the industry by starting loot boxes. Share it’s only cosmetic for them but that’s what other companies are saying too. Bastards.
We're going to see soon enough another video game ice age, E.T. style. I'm already bored of games (Every game is pretty much the same inside its genre, beside few titles) , now they're even money traps. Like me there are others, very soon even the fanboys and the apologist will join. We've been robbed of our hobby.
Joe EA went on twitter and responded and said that in the full game, progression will be faster, and there will obviously be more guns. \n\nI have been looking everywhere and I haven't found ANYTHING on the loot crate system with micro transactions, are we supposed to assume that they will have micro transactions? If we are assuming that they will have micro transactions, then it would be pay to win, BUT WE DON'T KNOW. WE CAN'T ASSUME ANYTHING. Even though it's EA, we don't know if they will put it in. I guess we will have to wait.
What to do about it? Don't play the f**king game!
There is news from battlefront 2. This loot system. It will.not actually be pay to win. They have to play like the rest of us to get the better loot. So if they were to pay, they would not get the best loot from paying
Just put a heavy object on your run button after you start a game so your character keeps going forward and is not marked as afk and can´t get kicked out of the game so you can farm those shitty credits to unlock stuff. Because that´s how the game is developed to be played after all am I right? I mean it clearly is meant to be played that way to progress.
How expensive are these lootcrates, if you buy them with credits?
Stupid Latino dickhead....
soumds like a shitty cell phone game
Loot boxes lives matter!
Fuck this game
720 BLAZE\n\nROFL FOR RIP
two gay guns
Install a trainer, problem solved
Godzilla is aproching the generator
What..you think everything is free, you those broke ass fools that agree with you are a joke. 
Downloading Battlefront 1 again. Thanks Joe 🙏🏻
They fixed the loot boxes on their website. You won't be able to use the upgrade without being a certain rank first.
Pretty sad that they took the gold crates concept from BF4 and made them pay to buy so you dont earn them by just ranking up. Now you could buy gold cases in BF4 but you could earn them by playing the game giving you a reason to play the game. My gripe with the first game was no progression system and no incentive to even play every match was like an un ranked game and worthless. Now this time they take one of your incentives to play through matches and hide it behind a pay wall. 1st one was fun for 2 days and then i ignored it this second one wasn't even hyped for it.
The biggest fail, was when EA got the Star Wars License.
Ok but can you stop giving a free pass to games like Overwatch, all loot crates systems need to go.
Thanks AJ...I just cancelled my pre-order.  As an adult gamer with a job and family I don't have over 10,000 hours to unlock a game I paid $80 for.\n\nIll say this...they change this LB nonsense I will come back.
Micro transactions are killing the gaming industry! Seriously, stop paying these pricks in order to win on a game that you already paid full price for as well as DLC because you have the gaming skills of someone that's cross-eyed with thumbs on your feet
publishers: take note. if 60$ worth of micro-transactions does not have a 100% chance of giving the same amount of enjoyment as BoTW, or Cuphead + A Hat in Time, or Minecraft + Terraria, then DONT PUT IT IN. EVER.\n\n\n\nI really hope Splatoon 2 (which is micro-transaction less) outsells this crap.
It’ll be different in the full game
Hey at least dlc will be free
Whilst I agree wholly with Joe's opinions here (if they are carried over to launch) I am reserving my opinion until launch because while EA don't have a great track record with regards to this kind of stuff, it isn't full and EA and DICE have stated that things are changing and they are listening to the community.
In this game you can buy advantage but u can't use ur advantage before u meet the requirements-> This is dumb on a whole other lvl. Just fuck off with the crates and sell the good game as it is. Build a community of happy customers... Don't piss on us with MICROTRANSACTIONS.... This joke is pushed beyond it's limits!
It shouldn't feel like a free to play loot model in a not free to play game
Technically they copied Paladins since Overwatch boxes only give cosmetics
Epic Fail on you, Joe! Instead of waiting for the release or some responce from EA, you just jumped to conclusions. This is very unprofessional!
Garbage game
Shut the fuck up and stop crying little bitch I want to play the game don't play the game don't worry about who's buying loot crate's you can easily buy to stop your bitching and complaining fuckboi
I wont be buying this game
Lootboxes aren't even are problem, people are just hating on if because everyone else is, smh
Oh my god, the hammer pulled you off? xD
Korgs voice is great expectation subversion. you'd expect him to have a deep low voice, but he doesn't. and he's quite eloquent too.
For all the people saying the voice doesn't fit the character, thats the point dipshits, its a joke.
Y’all complaining bout the voice doesn’t fit the character but not appreciating the pure brilliance of a gay sex joke in a Marvel 🎥.
korg is my favorite now. god bless this weird rock man.
Take notes, Fox! Kevin Feige/his crew can make a better *Thing* than your 4 failed attempt/boring/corny ass movies! LOL!
You guys do realize that this is not The Thing but in fact Korg, right?
Beached bro
Stupid accent for Korg, doesn't even match up with the animation and the accent in general sucks, couldn't even tell at first what he was saying. How the hell does the hammer rode you on your back become damma rude you on yus beck? \n\nStupiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid
Where can i find this Stand up comedy?
IT'S CLUMBERING TIME!
Knew the director would screw the movie. Just like Bay and Transformers. Korg better have some good fighting skills to compensate 4 that inaccurate voice the director so stupidly gave him.
Really that's his voice? Why would they even do that?
I don't think they filled the quota of 5 jokes per minute yet. Quick get him another quip.
I'd be fine with the voice if it sounded like he was trying but it's clear someone really didn't give a fuck about Korg
Yes! I knew the thing was in this!
Not enough quips
Why the fuck have Marvel allowed Taika to make Thor into a parody of himself? This looks horrible.
This scene is not funny. Fuck i think blade runner had funnier scenes than this.
That sounds nothing like Korg
Me encanta el video y  también la canción like si a ti también 😍😍😊😉
Now I'm confused since some of the lyrics changed...
I am tearing up of joy when i first watched the movie, And this song was making my heart melt

Love this song alot😀

Am i the only one who thinks that the real hero of the movie is Derpy? I mean didnt she save Twilight? :P
they used this in the movie cause the lady who was the wife was in a commercial for Yuban coffee and she said that line in the commercial
That's strange. Jim never vomits at home.
I will, but Jim won't
Her name is Lee Bryant...   She played the pregnant lady, Punkin in an episode of three's company when Jack and Chrissy agree to take over Janet's babysitting job for one night and had to put up  with a crying baby, no TV, and a locked liquor cabinet  :)
What a Parker Sign.
People think maths isn't cool, and after watching you, I think they may be on to something.
Well, there is a reason why it has dark hexagons: It is displayed on a plane. For simplification reasons, they did not use a fake 3D image because this hexagonal picture scales better and is easier to reproduce (scaling for all this folks that doubt it, the lines towards the outside will get blurred if scaled down with pentagonal structures).
I was told recently that the official standard for baseball's home plate is also a mathematically impossible shape. Is there something larger at play here with sports and maths? Conspiracy or not, I bet there's a joke or two in there...Look into it for us Matt.
Oh yeah- that'd be a good use of my road tax money, do that.......
Years from now, no one will remember what a hexagon is. But you win State, and that goes up on the water tower. - Hank Hill \n\nhttp://geocitiessites.com/arlen_texas/leagues.htm
Just checked, The Netherlands do have the correct geometry. Also just wanted to point out that the painted bicycles on the road surfaces are also wildly anatomically incorrect in the UK. Also worthy of a petition.
Matt, you are playing the Reading hexagon tonight, will that be a problem??
5:14 British? What about the Northern Irish people? I demand this be altered! I will have a petition up later if Matt doesnt respond!
I can't wait for the outcome of this petition! Lulz!
UK government, such a parker square....
How about this skidding car as another topologically incorrect uk sign? \nhttp://c8.alamy.com/comp/EHC763/new-road-layout-ahead-and-risk-of-skidding-road-signs-uk-EHC763.jpg
But what if on the back side of the ball you have triangles?
Ugh... This comment section has wonderfully illuminated the lacking sense of humour among the british public. Brilliant video Matt, don't let the not on my taxes lot get you down, they clearly weren't listening or comprehending.
Matt, thanks. I always love your videos. I'm not a UK citizen but would otherwise sign your petition. I realize that this video focused on your petition, but I'm a bit surprised that you didn't cover two obviously relevant digressions. The specific digressions that come to mind are:\n\nA) That the pattern currently depicted is a hexagonal latice which has a planar topology, like the street sign.\n\nB) That only a projection of a 3D shape (like a polyhedron can be depicted on a planar street sign, and what projection you propose the new signs using, (isometric, I presume?) Also might want to touch on the foreshortening around the edges on the projected polyhedron?\n\nC) The fact that, the inflated ball isn't truly a polyhedron, as the edges are arcs, not lines, and the faces aren't planar.\n\nD) History, repercussions and examples of Euler characteristics.
Waste of time and expense, I hope this comes to nothing.
Wow I never noticed that. Can anyone tell me if it is the same in the US?
So... it's a Parker football?
A) Hexagens?  Pentagens?\n2) The images of the castle and fish and elephant are not realistic either.
One day this man will run for a President!
You should talk to a designer about what that would look like.\n\nAlso, none of those really look like the thing they represent except in an abstract sense.  For one thing, things rarely have holes that go all the way though, at least not ones you can see though.
On the sign, you can only see one side of the ball. Obviously, the other side contains different shapes which make it round like a football.
the current symbol really is a parker ball i must say
Can I just say that the elephant sign is used even if no elephants are actually present at the wildlife park indicated. That's what I call misleading.
This is why petitions are jokes.
I couldn't care less about football but now you have pointed this error out I won't be able to stop noticing it until it is fixed.
Just signed. There are now 17,462 signatures. Enough for his letter, but keep going and we might actually get someone to really do something about it.
Perhaps they should replace it with a prolate spheroid. Wouldn't that be better?
On the bright side, at least your government didn't want to make pi, or the equivalent of 0.5 * tau, equal to 3.2
BASTARDS!  Seriously, this is like the stock teamwork photo of three gears which contact each other such that they cannot function as gears. How can a country with such commitment to football/soccer get this so wrong? I blame it on the metric system.\n\n\nAlso - you need to find someone to produce a PDF version of the desired replacement to prevent an even worse version and to eliminate the 'what would it look like' stuck in committee problem. In fact, do one the way you want and also one that is obviously not-right in an aesthetic way to give the illusion of choice. People like picking the 'good one' and not having a preferred answer shoved on them.
Is there any kind of non-Euclidean geometry where an all-hexagon ball does exist?
Suggestion: Provide an alternate design. People are much more willing to approve a change to correct something if they don't have to do what they perceive to be the hard part.
It's a bit brave to link Bristol FC with football, isn't it? Are you sure the sign represents a football?
I just feel sorry for all those motorists trying to figure out which lane to drive into seeing a sign with changing equations for geometry
Dammit I'm italian, I can't sign it
The number of sides on a pentagon is a prime issue... oh har har 5 is prime...
We'e living in a time of austerity though. The government spent £39m on legal fees to try to strip people of their rightful disability benefits, do you really think they'll waste money on something like this.... actually, something this pointless and petty does sound like exactly the kind of thing May and Hammond think matters
I *HATE* football, but I *HATE* mathematical/geometric errors more, so I have signed the petition.
That doesn't look *much* like a castle. The crossed arrow slit is either extremely rare or non existent.\n\nThe problem is that the surface the sign is on is flat, not a sphere. Therefore you can't cover it with a pentagon+hexagon coverage. I don't think the filmed actual football looks as football-like as the one on the sign.
Haha... although mathematically you are correct they still wouldn't match reality if they changed the pic. Nobody plays with that style of ball anymore anyway. The original one was called the Adidas Telstar introduced in 1970. The classic black and white ball. Used again in World Cup 1974 until being superceded by the Adidas Tango in '78. Originally the Telstar was introduced to help people see the ball more easily on black and white TVs.
Well since the regs have literally just gone through an overhaul I’d say it’s a nice idea but never gonna happen :p
I have signed many of those such petitions, but this is completely different from any petition I have seen on there before!
Can we just ban football altogether?
Without context I'm not sure I could've figured out what pentagins are.
This shows that brits knows as little about ⚽️ as them stupid Americans that calls 🏈 an football.
We did it R̶e̶d̶d̶i̶t̶ YouTube!
The ball on the signs does not look quite right. It seems unnatural.  Thanks for explaining the mathematical reason why,
I am in the US but glad to see you making a difference in society and mathematics
I almost spit out my coffee at 3:21.
the government [...] don't really care about mathematics and science.\nOOH, D'YA THINK?!
He says all other signs make sense, but the wheelchair one you can see when he is saying that doesn't contain a full wheel.
Isn't a parliamentary petition overkill? Surely you just need to get a memo to the right department...
In my opinion this is a real problem worth fighting for #footbolsignmatters
Concerning your claim that no such ball can be made of (possibly distorted) hexagons: While the mathematics is surely correct, this does not exclude the possibility that some other shapes (say, pentagons) were used at the *back side* of the ball (that is not pictured on the road sign). This probably makes a less symmetrical soccer balls - but if we allow strangely distorted hexagons for the faces of the soccer ball, why not also allow to use differently shaped faces at the backside of the soccer ball (that one cannot see on the sign)?
Tank training ground is a Cromwell on signs.
Matt, I am sure you can come up with an imperfect approximation to a ball made all with hexagons and we'll call it The Parker Ball.
Perhaps the street signs are incorrect in _Euclidean_ geometry, but here in the real world we use _Minkowski_ geometry. Can you make a sphere out of hexagons in Minkowski space?
That was an interesting video!  At first, I thought, Who cares?  But, then when I thought about it and how you only wanted the newly made signs updated, I realized it does matter enough to correctly display football images on newly made signs.  Way to go, I hope you get your petition positively recognized.  I cannot sign anything since the only part of me that is UK is long past ancestry.
Petition to make him pronounce hexagon correctly
It's a Parker soccer ball, it's valid in Parker geometrical spaces
Undoubtedly a serious problem. Now all we have to fix is all those arrows pointing to the sky. Am sick of getting misdirected into space. It really messes up my day.
Just did it don't even like football but if its 3D will look 10 times better
Am I crazy or does he have an australian accent?
It's worth noting that the icosahedron was used in the Fat Man atomic bomb. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_icosahedron#Applications\nIt seems the ball is changing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(association_football)#FIFA_World_Cup\nMatt is right on this one. The representation on the sign is obviously incorrect, and lots of math-inclined people would notice.
*What is the music that you use at the end of this video?*
I don't see any footballs, hexagins, or pentagins - only soccer balls, hexagons, and pentagons.
Will there be a petition to change the airplane icon too? A plane wont fly without engines.
Wow, my Dad told me about this a couple of days ago... I should have know you were behind it!! Haha

A ball made entirely of hexagons is known as a Parker Ball
Why not just get rid of all footyball nonsense in public entirely? It is a paupers game.
The zoo sign is also wrong!  Elephants' trunks always curl in, not out!
and where is the mathematics of a real football?\nhow many possible shapes can you combine to make a succesful football?
This is like saying the size and proportion of a castle sign is wrong we mist change it
Speaking as an American, I envy you that this is the worst of your mathematical problems.  8)
You've got too much time on your hands!
Alright then, The sign for roadworks needs changing because not all road workers are Black.
I totally agree! In norway, feminists got through to change all the old pedestrian crossing signs to a unisex silhouette of a person crossing, than the old man with a hat-silhouette. This cost Norway about 80m NOK, which is a bit less than 8m GBP. Crazy!\nI do agree that it was poorly designed, back in the 70's, but lets update the symbol, so all new signs get updated, and use those 80m NOK a bit more sensible.
THIS HAS BUGGED ME FOR YEARS, and I'm glad you noticed too.
Brilliant way to make geometry cool.\n\nMy man! \n(JL trailer reference)
i bet you can use a infinite flat surface as a ball as long you are playing on a hyperbolic plane..
I think it's of hexagons because you don't need to distort them on 2d space so it was easier to create lol Britons are lazy.
I don't know about the castle, I'll need to hear Shadiversity opinion on that.
HexagOn, pentagOn, gOn, GON!! O!!!'
Y R amazig!!
sounds like helen czerski and raindrop signs
this man is awesome
Parker square ball
17,418 when I signed :)
Wow, those are truly parker-football signs
nice chalkboard
Wtf have I just watched
NERRRRRRDDD!!!!!!!!!!
Icons aren't meant to be real, they are meant to be easy to see and quickly to be recognisable. – Signs don't use photorealistic iconography of other things like cars, lorries, trees, because that would make it not stand out. – Would a pentagon-hexagon ball be easier to see then a solely hexagon ball?
I think you've missed the point of asking why the football has hexagons rather than pentagons.  As you say in the video, hexagons tessellate on a flat surface, and it is this flat surface that the designer is trying to achieve.  All of the roadsign designs feature a flattened, simplified perspective.  By these rules of perspective, a sphere must be replaced by a flat disk, and so the mixture of hexagons and pentagons must be replaced with a hex grid.\n\nI would have preferred regular hexes, though.
Who cares, it's a small meaningless change... also will the government listen to a petition and then waste money on useless sign changes
Yah, but then you can round the hexigon, gcd lcm, so 6 into 5, 30.  You cant easily use 15 without a cooly ball.  But why not?  In 1995, they had advanced materials, whirly tennis balls, you could play tennis in the rain.  It was so bouncy and aerodynamic that you could dip legendary shots, in the rain.  Man that was cool because any old man with wilson whites wasnt anywhere, just your marine core tennis pals. LOL! The ball was fusia, neon, and indigo ripple like a racquet ball, but hat slight overweight and under pressure with poly fillament that grabbed the air, discontinued in 2001 due to cannibals?  I was mad one time, and i realized baseball,  Take a ball because my bat blows smoke?  Upper cut a top spin into the short stop hitting the grass square negative curl for a frack your mom douglas serve koopa troopa.  So it stands to reason that whirly cleats with ankle 400 lbs skocks an d carbide teath are so supperior that nobody could beat and defeat them.  So we learned in 1993 how to compound with a caroitoid lever for acceleration.
its a road sign... its not really that significant
Do we really want to use tax money to change these
You need to do something about these ones as well!  https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/55b76bec40f0b6790f000019/warning-sign-slippery-road.jpg
This will be a great show. Not just good. GREAT!
what a time to be alive - Stephen King's Bank Account (Probably).
The shawshank car at the end really did it for me, than one upped it with the you dont know what your dealing with do you? My theory about bill is he serves at shawshank because when he appears he is in one of those straight jackets. Guess i gotta get hulu now for this and runaways.
Did I just see my boy Cujo? And that Shawshank sticker? Ohhhh I'm ready for this.
They caught me in the background lmao it's amazing the things they've done to my town though. They've fixed up a lot for this movie. Shooting is taking place in orange Massachusetts if you didn't know
They float. They aaaaall floooat. And when your car goes into the water, it'll float too.
Young Red from The Shawshank Redemption?

Oh my!  I can't wait for this!  I'm a Stephen King FREAK!  And the quality that could be put into today's head tippy paranormal scary stuff is so improved over the older movies based on his books (take IT for example... Look at the difference between the original and the remake!) I  hope Hulu puts out some quality stuff!   I like scary. weird series.  Netflix is a well established force to be reckoned with.  Hulu has a way to go to earn that kind of respect, but give em time.  The market is getting competitive and that only serves to keep all the franchises on their toes, and bringing the best content they can to win the subscribers over.  I find it all very exciting... From a viewer's pov!
If this comment gets 2 likes I will get Hulu to watch this.
Sissy motherfucking Spacek
I love Andre Holla,d I love Stephen King, I like JJ Abrams a lot, and the trailer looks visually stunning.
this is going to be incredible.
Sounds like a DEAD MAU5 score
But no one is mentioning André Holland from The Knick. One of the reasons why I'm watching this.
So ready to see what this is all about...Especially because I'm in it well hopefully if they had all of the footage anyways
What’s Castle Rock about?
I want a Friday the 13th movie to watch tomorrow
The music is cool
Anybody know if it's possible to get your hands on this edit of Coelacanth I ? I am obsessed with this version!!
Anyone know who the music is by?\nFreaking love it.
The viewers really win when Hulu and Netflix have to keep stepping their games up to compete with one another. Can’t wait for everyone to see how good Bill Skarsgard is outside of his Pennywise roll. Such a talent.
a trailer with Deadmau5 soundtrack...you have my attention Hulu
IS THAT DEADMAU5?!? I THINK SO. IS HE COMPOSING THIS?!?!!
Nice ! But only need access to Hulu from Canada you know, it can help.
I want the music more than anything, somebody please make music like this for the sake of humanity
This looks freaking amazing... I need to get Hulu
Look out Stranger Things...Hulu has got you in their sights.
Is this related to Shawshank redemption?
Is this series lik free hulu or do we hav to pay?
Bill and Stephen better become the next Tim Burton and Johnny Depp
♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥\n*Jesus Christ is the Son of God, who died and rose from the dead to Give us eternal life.*\n*He also promised to heal your body.*\n*This Is True Love!!!  (Just ask Him)*
Holy shit, the kid who plays it is in this. It really IS gonna tie everything together.
Can't wait to see this show.  And really can't wait for them to be done shooting it causing all these traffic delays in my town
Andre Holland = Bae, he's a talented actor too, ever since moonlight i had my eye on him.
Wow Hulu with show is awesome \nbut  I would like someone or some channel to bring it back to The Twilight Zone and Tales from the Crypt that would be great
Let me guess, this takes place in Maine?
An Emmy for Sissy Spacek?  She deserves one for this!
I couldn't have been the only one surprised to hear a Deadmau5 track on this trailer
Castle Rock is a town in Colorado. One of many places King is fond of using for inspiration in his stories.
What's the track playing in the background?
0:41  41 years ago Sissy Spacek performed Carrie in the adaptation of brilliant  Stephen King, this year surely will make a cameo in this series.
Soo happy its getting filmed in my town
Isn't Castle Rock the name of that place in Lord of the Flies? lmao
I used to live in castle rock, co
can we expect to see Johnny Smith in it?
Really looking forward to this. I'm loving this Stephen King revival, hes such a great storyteller and his books deserve great adaptions (we can just forget The Mist tv show happened tho).
I just want The Knick to return.
It's kinda weird bill skarsgard is in this lol
Let me guess, it is set in creepy town in Maine where everything isn't what it seems...gee, how original Mr. King.
When anyone writes something It's from their mind. From Stephen King's mind?
They're filming this in my town
I could watch Andre Holland cook beans and rice in a 3x5 kitchen for HOURSSSSS, I can't wait!
Based on the trailer, this movie gonna have some sick drops m8 and cubes
Goddamn it. Make a fucking true Dark Tower show.\n*HOLLYWOOD, IT'S MAJOR MONEY IN YOUR POCKET A FAITHFUL ADAPTATION!!!!*
Newsflash: THIS IS HOW YOU PRODUCE A DAMN GOOD TRAILER!!!
Wow. This is going to be great , I can tell.
Hulu is like what LoveFilm was to Netflix
Well it has my attention. Hate when trailers spoil whole movies or shows.
Does this link in with 11.22.63 that was a pretty dope show no one ever talks about

FUCK!
Dude they’ve got Pennywise AND Carrie? Stephen King Fest!
DEADMAU5!!!!!!!
Guy from THE KNICK
Giving up on Hulu. New interface SUCKS totally.
Andre Holland & Sissy Spacek... I'm there!!!
anybody catch the shawshank easter egg at 1:05
I really hope Carrie appears
joels coelanth
Its exclusive un hulu?
No captions?
DEADMAU5
Is Bill Skarsgard playing Andy Dufrense?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!! dangit I have Netflix.
deadmau5
Deadmau5 sound mixing!
Andre Holland !
WANT THIS!
nice nice
Go Algernon!
This looks amazzzizzzing
Like Castle Rock, Colorado?
Me: *sees ad*\n\nCastle Rock\n\nMe: this is Stephen King. This is totally going to be Stephen King. I know this reference from It.\n\n*bill skarsgard shows up*\n\nMe: yep, it even has bill skarsgard.\n\nfrom the mind of stephen king*\n\nMe: I WAS RIGHT.
I'm getting Stranger Things vibes.
even at $5.99 a month I don't want Hulu.  it's trash and I refuse to pay any amount of money for a service that forces me to watch commercials
Bad trailer.
Fuck Stephen king, YOU SUCK BITCH!!!!!!!!!!!!
I need Hannah Hart to be my best friend.
Have you researched PMDD? It sounds like you might be dealing with that. I hope it gets easier!
I came out to my best friend the day this video was uploaded!!!
No ad...demonetized. Poor Hannah. Thank you for keeping on and staying positive.
💟💟💟 all the love to you, Hannah
Coming out with something?  I can come out as being lazy.  But everyone knows this already.  I don't even have to mention it.  Also i don't think it's a fight I'm having with something I can't help.  I agree it's probably one of those your choices define who you are, rather than your choices are made for you by who you are.  I could be wrong though.  Maybe I got something wrong with me where I know I should go to the store and buy something to make a healthy meal, but instead, would rather order a pizza and watch Hannah Hart videos all day.
My fiance just came out to me 7 months ago that he now she is trans and I couldn't be happier for us I knew there was a reason why I always more attracted to women and it's like it was always ment to be but I'd love her no matter what sex she wanted to be it's been rough but we have good days and bad days and in the end as long as we love each other that's all that matters
Yesss thank you Hannah! I actually came out about how I hate my job on coming out day! How timely and sage your advice is 😊
It has took a day to watch this cause my mam dosent know😂😂
Currently in a depressive rut and was proud, because I just finished my shower after not showering for...some number of days :) Thanks for the pep talk!
It is hard...but totally worth it. I’m getting married this weekend...and 180 people are coming to celebrate us! That is amazing. We are so loved...and the struggle was real.
National coming out day 😂😂 fuck sake. This world is so stupid
Wow, I have over the years began to realize a pattern in my moods too. It is an annual shift around September or October, and I used to push everyboby and everything away from me. It would last months, and I was a super depressed meany. I am not as bad now, I acknowledge it and accept I am feeling this way. Then I fight like crazy to not be so mean and moody. It has been about 10 years now. I still get this way every year, till about New Year. I let people close to me know. Hang in there. It is not all bad. hehehe👍🌈
Hannah Hart I just love you! You're so awesome and always bring me joy when I watch your videos! That's all I want to say :) <3 Happy coming out day to you! :)
*come for the Hannah*\n*stay for the more Hannah*
Depression is an everyday all day thing for me. XD
Yesterday I came out to my mother as bi. I've only been out online and accidentally to my brother so I was REALLY scared to come out to her. I've been planning this forever and it still took so much effort but I did it! She was really accepting of me, she told me she loved me and gave me a hug. It was great!!
Your video soundtrack didn't
if you’re out to some people but not everyone, can you still be considered “out”?
❤you Hannah. Also why you bruise your lips crazy lady😭
Unfortunately there will always be small mi did people.
I'm sorry that you're blue (emotionally and physically),  I am so impressed that you managed this video when I have those days I struggle to say my own name.
I love that you're in tune to what your cycle does to your mental health...I need to figure mine out. Can anyone tell me the app she uses to track her cycle? I know she said it in a different video.
I wore my straight outta the closet shirt and I wore it to church and I got kicked out of church and was told I was sick
Man I wish I could....maybe one day.
Thank you so so much for eveything and being the wonderful person you are and share it! Go you !! 💞💞💞💞
I hope your downswing eases soon.  Lots of love from another Bisexual ADHD Hannah <3
I appreciate that you are transparent in sharing your true self with the world. Depression and Sexuality are very powerful topics. Thank you for sharing.
I'm trying to get my sister alone to tell her I'm gay. This is terrifying.
hey Hannah~ I love your message and the content you put out! I would love to collaborate with you on my podcast on my website @ beyoubeproud.org
You know, I roll out of bed in the morning, and take a walk in a local park before I can really think about how bad I feel. I shower when I get back. So, go take that walk, and worry about cleaning up later. It really does help.
Thank you for keepin it real!
May everything in your life be covered in rainbows and joyThanks Hannah xxxx
Love is a journey - i'm stealing that.
I've heard some people put it as 'Sometimes it doesn't get better, it gets different'
Hannah- thank you for making and putting up this video even when you weren’t feeling well.  That is a truly unselfish gift.  Sending get well hugs and hope that you feel better soon!!  😊
Came out to my dad today! I was realy strest out obout it but he responded amazingly
I identify with something Shane Dawson once said: Life doesn´t get better, what get´s better is your tollerance for bullshit.
Thanks for this video, Hannah! So sweet and so true. <3\nBy the way, that is a really great idea to tell your friends to ask you specific questions. I might have to use that too!
I'm bi but I'm in a serious relationship with a man. Do you think I should come out to my parents? Does it matter?\nLike if they know my bf and I don't ever date a girl why do they need to know who I've had sex with?
My therapist told me one time, “no one is ever done growing and learning. No one is a chicken you bake in the oven and it’s done and  cooked.”
Hi I had a questions and would really look forward to hear your opinion everyone.

YjtRY28Pe2o,Is it even good to have a day named after a group of people that share the same (quality, idea, belief, or sexuality)?

YjtRY28Pe2o,For example, I am not black but I feel like it is offensive to have something called Black History Month. I am an Atheist, but I would never want a day to be called International Atheist Day. I feel like that it creates more division instead of bringing people together, because you are excluding a group of people and say ok here is 1 day (week or month), this is yours and you can do whatever you want but after this you have to shut up about it.

YjtRY28Pe2o,But also I have heard from my friend that it is very different with sexualty since it is even hard for the person to figure it out and accept it and it makes it feel better to have that day and celebrate.

YjtRY28Pe2o,If you disagree with me I would like to hear your argument and also I want a day for these things, Asian middle eastern day, Gamer day, cyclist day, not much of a drinker day, believe in parallel universe day, AI enthusiast's day, not radio listener day, etc.
Opps, didn't know there was a national coming out day. \n\nI came out a week ago in my 23rd birthday 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
I appreciate the comments about anxiety and depression, Hannah. Walks are good and depression is rough.. and it just so happened to be on my birthday. 😂😅😅
You're right hannah. Love IS crazy! Feel better soon.
Yes, it does get better! And then worse, lol. Yes...that's life! \nAnd hey - I had the lowest day of my cycle yesterday too.
thankyou for this you are such an inspiration to girls and the broader lgbtq+ community. i love you so veyr much and look up to you so much <3 <3
I didn't even know it was national coming out day, but I came out to my mom as bi!
Love you Hannah, I appreciate your honesty and openness.
Remember: It's better to be hated for WHO I AM rather than loved for what I AM NOT. YOU GUYS ARE LOVED! ❤️❤️❤️
I am a gay man (he/him) and you are so f-ing beautiful in everyway Hannah Hart. *You are love,* that's what you are. *<3*
Was gonna post my story. Got too distracted by Hannah's t-shirt and the hilarious Paddy's related memories it brings...
Hope you had a great National Coming Out day and yes, I believe that it always get better. Even if life can be hard at times, everything will always get better since giving up is not an option as we work through the worst, not losing hope and remain strong each time, just like on how we LGBTQ community keep on fighting for our rights and acceptance and those with mental health issues coming to terms with it and work on coping with it or at the very least, we focus on the positive and what makes us happy to make with help from our loved ones us feel better :)
This has really made me feel alot better about coming out to my nan thank you keep up with the good videos!!!
Well, I am a straight guy and I would date you in a hartbeat. Sorry for the pun ;D\n\nIn all honesty. You are one of the most genuine youtubers and I love the fact that you use this platform for important stuff like this!
You’re adorable, thank you for being you all of the time. It makes those of use who haven’t been ourselves want to be stronger. ❤️
You're right, Hannah, it does get better ... and sometimes worse ... and then better. Mostly better. I have been blessed that my coming out experiences have been primarily positive. Fortunately, I live in a supportive community and surround myself with positive people. To all the young gays out there ... try to find positive, supporting people and, to the extent possible, minimize the negative people in your life. As Hannah says, coming out is a journey, not a destination!
I feel you boo. I've also been depressed AF today. Made myself leave my house. I went to the Ocean after dark, walked on the beach and cried. Felt much better after, but still down.
it doesnt necessarily get BETTER so much as it gets... easier. handling the curveballs life throws at you gets easier with each experience.
SAME, every month I have to fight the urge to eat all the fats and carbs I can reach haha it does get worse before it gets better :)
Two inspirational videos by MyHarto and IISuperwomanII 😂\nHappy Day of the Girl and Happy Coming Out day!!
i'm so proud of myself as yesterday i came out to everybody at school and now im happy with myself because everyone was so supportive 😊
Love yourharto!  I feel like I need to take a wall at my house and do a giant graph. Maybe my downswings will be on a cycle as well?  Hmm
I battle anxiety, I hate my job. Wait, I whine about that every day on the social network so I guess I'm already out on that.
Right there on that peak low with ya
Cishet ally and parent here if anyone needs to talk ☺
Love  you!  You are beautiful and insightful and funny and kind.   I hope you feel chipper again very soon.  Walk and shower; great ways to perk up. ♥
Thanks Hannah... I really needed this today <3  When misery loves company! Yay for company!! ^_^;;
I love how real this video is.. this is what our kids/adults who are struggling need to hear. Not a fantasy story that they won’t even buy anyway... they need need the truth. This is encouraging for many reasons, but most importantly it reminds us that we are not alone or weird or weak for feeling how we are feeling and that even successful people like you experience ups and downs. Thank you for being vulnerable and honest with us. Sending love!!
I don't normally comment on videos but I am now. My 12yr old niece came out to me today. She told me that she's been planning on coming out today since June of this year. I am so incredibly proud of her. I love how open and honest she is. My sister, her mother, did not have the same reaction. Which, honestly, surprised me. I love me niece and support her no matter what. But my sister is my best friend and while I know she's most likely just scared and confused I don't know what to do. Any advice would help. Thank you.
Straight white dude here. Came out about developing PTSD while I was deployed. I have never been better.\n\nI'm so glad that you have such a public voice to spread such positive vibes.\n\nAlso, to anyone that struggles with coming out thinking that your straight friends would care,  well... A real friend doesn't care. \n\nAlso Hannah leave the house. Or drink. Or fuck it, both.  :-)
Ok,so I think that I might be gay or bi or sth I don't know,and I started thinking about it about 3 years ago and I was in denial until a few months ago, and all of this started weirdly,like not like most people start questioning,and I'm like what if I'm wrong and only 1-2 people know,but some of my closest friends do not and I'm trying to decide whether to tell them,even if I haven't figured it out,or not
It's not going to get 100% better, 100% of the time. Very true!
is your monthly depression somehow linked to your pms like mine? coz god I get so deeply depressed every month around that time, its just makes my regular depression worse for a few days, it just feels terrible..
I hope it does get better, and that one day I can be proud of who I am.
Hannah.  You are very wise.  Yes.  Coming out is extremely important, whatever you are coming from/ are/ want/ long/ need to be.  Take care, love.
I agree with everything you said in this video. Per the monthly cycle of emotional flux: it’s important to note the full moon can be used to clear extra baggage. While New moon will assist in attracting your desires...
I needed this today ❤️😊
Coming out is a journey, not a destination. Exactly right Ms. Hart. Some days there's little traffic and clear highways, some days it's gridlock, once in a while you have a flat tire. But keep going, and reach out to someone if you find you need a navigator.\nFind yourself thinking about giving it up? Don't. Just keep driving. Better is just up the road a bit.
Thank you Hannah! Love you and as always, take care of your self!
Hey Hannah I know you wont read this but ill try anyway. My ex was bipolar so I know patterns of emotional highs and lows pretty well. I'm not saying that you are bipolar but I am saying that if you see a pattern in your emotion then maybe talk to someone that can help you know? Especially if everything in your life is going well. IF there is an imbalance in your body then it helps to have a professional to talk to about it or even take medicine if it is necessary (not that medicine should ever be a first choice). But anyway I hope you feel better hun.
I love you, Hannah. Keeping it really real. I'm shi**y, I'm fine, today sucks, what a great day, I'm super depressed, wow I just had a fantastic idea!, I barely got out of bed, making this video is important to me, if you feel shi**y talk to someone, good Lord today sucks, have a great day everyone!!!\n\nI just love ya so much! You're just fantastic!\n\nKeep up and you will be kept up~ Yogi Bhajan\n💛
Thank you,  it is nice to hear that.  Twice in past year I have been cornered by family trying to force me to come out to them. I only within this year have really come to terms with myself and the label queer (I think I identify as Asexual maybe Demisexual, but talking to people in the past about it didn't go well for me). But, it is still good to hear encouragement.
I am feeling depressed today because Joey Graceffa couldn't make it to Colorado. :( Thank you Hannah, you always make my day :)
You're one of the reasons I felt confident when I came out Hannah, so thank you. I had a depressed day today too so I feel you girl. We're all here for one another. You're not alone❤
Happy coming out day my love! I love u so much! Thanks for inspiring me <3
To anyone who came out and it was not well received, don't let yourself feel too down because there are tons of people out in the world who care and will accept you.  Also, the plus side is that now you have a handy little list of people you don't need to buy Christmas/Hanukkah presents for if you celebrate the holiday ;)
I’m asexual and aromatic dammit!!!!!!!!!!! \n\nWhy won’t my friends stop asking me why I haven’t dated anyone yet!?!?!??  I have told them I was asexual and they said that would make me a soulless bitch. IM NOT A SOULLESS BITCH!!!!!!!
You are such an inspiration to me, just as an amazing human being. Thank you for this video.
4 years ago after Hannah posted a video on National Coming Out Day I wrote I think I might like girls. into my diary...and I was totally right, still super gay!
❤️
Yay rainbows!!

Seriously, you guys need your own clothing lines, Graveyard Girls and Dogman.

Yes buy dog mans outfits please!
ive never heard dogman talk so much lol
scooopsss👏👏👏

Scoops to dog man!!!!!!!!!!
I LOVE the flower-colored dress!
Manic day as opposed to depressive day I see
I'm so confused... both Bunny and Dogman have matching rings on their left ring finger but they always say they are boyfriend and girlfriend... what are the rings for?
Jenna is LITERALLY wearing that same blue ridiculous PONY jacket in her video where she buys juliens clothing!!!! The irony lol
They r so cute
Bunny you look awesome in those olive pants! And those glasses are definitely purple. You look great in almost anything I think. Your beautiful and adorable 💖
If you wore pants you would get used to it. And it wouldn't bother you..
I'm so happy I wanna be cry\n\n#TrueLove
Thoes green pants suit you.... and when he hit you with the jacket 😂😂
Normally I was not intending to buy the season pass but now that I saw the DLCs I'm 100% buying it
Oh wow. They've actually implemented the Nome system of Greek administration for Egypt. That's some good attention to detail.
Ever since I watched the hilarious viral video How the entire world was made, I guess I had been really interested in anything on the first few centuries where the Roman, Egyptian, and Persian empires were around. All of a sudden now this game has really peaked my interest.
YOU CAN FIGHT THE EGYPTIAN GODS?!
So do I have to get it on day one to experience all the daily quests and god boss battles or can I always replay them?
this looks too awesome, i love it and cant wait for 16 days
Trials of the gods <3
DLC and the game isn't even out yet? How can I not think that they're doing that carving the game up to release it in pieces to make more money thing. Good to know that even if I shell out $60 I'm not getting the full game experience anymore.
So the animus is still a thing, then......
You told us there would be no content locked in Season Passes from now*!\n*Which was like half a year ago.\n\nMicrotransactions AND day one paid DLCs, no thank you.\nThe game looks decent and the place you've chosen for it is perfect but I don't think it's gonna be worth it considering all that.
You made this look tight
post launch.....so the game is out already? idiots\n\npostlaunch in British\n(ˌpəʊstˈlɔːntʃ)\nadjective\nrelating to or occurring in the period *after* a launch
We want to constantly surprise our players - then don't go for the pre-order bonus BS, make all DLC free if it's integral to the main game (paying a little extra for something if it's a proper expansion pack is fine) and actually have a proper-length story with a rich mythos like AC1 & 2 especially like all the other studios that are determined to only see their players as wallets with brains - that WOULD be a surprise.
This game feels so about the brotherhood only i love it
this game is going to be killer cant wait for the 27th and ashraf is really proud for this game and im sure it will be wroth the wait
a bit less for a 50€ season pass or not?
Anyone know the name of the soundtrack in the middle that sounds like origins take on ezio family soundtrack from AC2?
Really excited for 'The Hidden Ones' expansion. \nI always love DLC set after the main story
i'm glad that I pre-order the gold edition then !! 100$ worth it 4sure !! thanks for hearing us UBI !!
Major props. The Season Pass for this game is actually harmless, thanks to the free content. I expected The Mummy(pretty much) stuff to be a Season Pass-only thing. But its not.\n\nAlso, I like that they're just going nuts with these time periods now. I mean really, the Egyptian Gods will be a threat? Thats awesome, and its used in a way that makes sense in the AC universe, a glitch in the Animus(I bet Juno's the cause of it).\n\nWell, Ubiosft's going to have to make an AC game set in Ancient Greek now, so the Greek Gods can be a threat. Or how about an AC game set in Japan, with Japanese Gods as threats, etc. Just go all out with the ancient time periods.
omg pls let the photo modus include videoclips! it will make the content creator side sooo much better if you are able to do own cinematics
This is going to be wayyyyyyyyyyyyy better than Syndicate !
My god this looks incredible!
Take my money, idc I want it
Pretty nice O_O
oh man I can't wait to buy the dlc after playing the full videogame! and then buying the season pass so I can play even more content when it comes out! I love being a consumer. I hope this game has microtransactions. I can't wait for the next Ubisoft™ videogame!
Does anyone know if you will be able to get the season pass after the game releases separate from the other packs as I have already pre ordered the deluxe edition and don’t fancy spending £70-£80 on the gold edition
Instant buy after i saw the Well what it is? gesture in 2:18.
As soon I saw this I was like ‘Oh, Sh*t just got real.’\nI AM SOOOOO FUCKING HYPED!!!! YEAH!!! I AM SO HYPED!!
Can't wait
He looks life foseytube
Hoping it doesn't suck
Let me guess thier after king tut lol
Yesssssssss
Soaking wet.
Looks promising!
Epic Ac version
I already bought the standard edition and I want to upgrade to gold with out paying the $100.00 for the game that I had already bought
I buy cod games every year, and im looking forward to ww2...but ive had to choose between this or cod this year and I gotta say im even more confident on going with assassins creed origins! Man i cant wait to get my hands on this game! Thanks ubisoft, u guys are ranked 2nd on my list behind rockstar games as the greatest video game makers in history!
The more I see, the more I fall in love. I cannot wait!
Besides all this awesome stuff, I just cant wait for the soundtrack to be released too. The music on this video is epic.
Dlc-The mummy/shadow of colossus/exodus gods of Egypt vibes right here anything missing ?
I think this game will return like AC 1,2, brotherhood and Revolution or much better
This game looks incredible from the trailers. I hope they dont downscale the graphics 20% at launch but keep it as it is. Also I hope there is no bugs this time (like a guy without a face etc.) Excited!
i dont know if i can trust ubisoft again. But this looks really great. oh nooooo
the game isnt even out yet and they are doing trailers for the dlc how is this just not content taken out of the original game
Are the Roman Centurion and Horus skins both available on launch for those who got the Gold edition or will they gradually be released after launch?
DLCs are not bad they revive a game and make ppl talk about the game more earning money and players in the process so for the most part there are good but there's a difference between an honest dlc and cut content that didn't make it to final game
So you're advertising a season pass, for a game that hasn't even come out yet?
Season Pass before the release of the game?!
Man that 1:16 golden legendary bow though, it is so gorgeous. I can't w8 any longer
Jesus haven't seen a developer this passionate about their own game in a long fucking time.......really shows he's really proud of the content he's made......\n\nLong live the Creed..
This will be the best selling AC ever. Black Flag was awesome because of Ashraf Ismail, and this time he's proved that origins gonna break the records. Huge world and maps to exploration.
I wished this game will not have super - natural elements in it. What I got instead is huge snakes inverted arrows, now undead egyptian gods. If there are micro - transactions in it too I won't buy.
I'm telling you. The game looks like Ryse Son of Rome fighting mechanics and the modes of the Egyptian mythology while Ryse did the Roman mythology. Ryse was the best game I played and I'm happy to see them re image ACO into a Ryse concept.
The Ezios Family Remix in the background is awesome!
+1 if you will take gold edition or gods edition i ll take one of them
Isn't gold edition releasing on 27 October then what about the DLCs
Ill wait for the definitive/goty edtion to come out
This is your last shot with me Ubisoft...do not fail me. I will pre order just because this was the team behind black flag. Be the glimmer of light in this dark time of venomous publishers and developers.
When Ubisoft make a series assassin creed in Indonesian historis?
OK now do this over, but without using the word content
Assassin's Creed Origins is made with passion & lots of hard work. I think it's going to be the best game in the whole series. Ashraf Ismail has done such a great job & Egypt looks insanely beautiful in this game.
You can tell that these guys really dedicated themselves to this game and not produce some nonsense bullshit.
To the gold edition players
This series explanation for everything is it's an animus glitch
will season pass owners be able to play the dlc's right off when we install the game?
lol man blinked every 2 seconds...
I'm not even joking when I say this has so much potential. They're going full-on RPG, taking cues from The Witcher 3, Skyrim, and even Breath of the Wild. My favorite AC game is currently Black Flag, but with how this looks, that just might change. I'm just hoping with all my heart that they don't f*ck up and disappoint all of us.
Why do you think anybody would be thrilled to see a trailer for DLC that we have to pay for before the game is even launched?\n\nAt least the free content sounds good.
HE SAID ANIMUS NOT HELIX YES YES YES
I caaaaan't waiiiit
Why tf does Bayek have double hidden blade?
WE
WE
Giant enemy crab!
Phát hành trên youtube vài ngày máy vậy anh
I know the game hasn't come out yet but I'll ask anyway. Do you think i should play ac unity and syndicate since i haven't played them or skip them and just play this?
typical money greedy Ubisoft. If you have a DLC trailer for a game that hasn't even been released yet, then you can add the DLC to the main game and even extend the release date. End this Season Pass nonsense you've completely brainwashed most gamers with once and for all
Hopefully we can get like Japan or China next,show Asians some love man,and we could finally sneak around as a ninja lol
Looks like I'll be busy playing Assassin's Creed origins and next spring playing the new Red Dead redemption 2
why does this have to come out the same day as wolfenstein :( Space out the games people..!
Can i just preorder the game with the season pass? I dont want the deluxe edition and get those good weapons because i wanna farm good weapons and armor
Excited about the game and the DLC but my attention comes to focus on about 50 seconds in, the The Hidden Ones poster. Take a good long look at it, can you see what I see?\nReplace Egypt with San Fransisco\nBayek with Marcus\nThe other assassin's with Sitara and Wrench\nIt's clearly a recreation of the Watch Dogs 2 box art poster!
This content should be in the main game, not be DLC for payment.
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PRESENT DAY STORYLINE?
Shut up and talk about PC PORT!!!
The game isint even out and Ubiseptic tank is already advertising season pass dlc and post content? Youre really putting the cart in front of the fucking horse aren't you? Delay this game and include all this extra content in the base game at launch.
Remember when you would pay $60 and get the full game?
I like this Origins Ezio's Family tune
This is just wrong. Release the damn game first!! Then you can talk about the dlc. We need to enjoy the main course first before we dive in to dessert. A Shamefur Dispray.
Ashraf Ismail u sold ure soul for some money.. what an unfortunate bargain
im sooo happy that i got the gold edition now
Can ubisoft make an new assassin's creed in like 2019? But the assassin's is in the Philippines,Philippines has a great history about Filipino's against Spain the Filipino's have a secret army like guys called katipunero and they are called the KKK and they fight for freedom from the Spain people and yes I'm a Filipino.
Ok, am I taking crazy pills or do some parts of the background music sound like Ezio's Family? if they're bringing it back as main theme, I'm stoked
The combat before wasn't perfect but at least it made you feel like a badasss assasssin, this combat is ugly and boring
Dlc dlc and dlc. This is why i prefer piracy.
It's not free content if we're paying $60-$100. In fact, what you should be saying is Season Pass and Gold edition buyers will be receiving stolen content. Content that was intentionally removed or left out of the game, content that is supposed to be included. I'll pirate it and rate it zero stars from Amazon to Metacritic. You're greedy scum bags, I hope this game crashes and burns like Unity.
Enemies bigger than a  house .... this is not Assassin  Creed anymore...
sigh look at all the likes, people are actually defending this season pass bullshit, cutting content out to be resold back to you piece by piece, this generation of gamers are happy to bend over to corporate greed and anti-consumer practices,  they deserve to be milked like this. Welcome to  gaming in 2017 enjoy buying your $60 skeleton experience.
I'll Be Your Pilot debuted at #7 on the New Alternative 40 Chart this week:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkY6RV0nVEA&list=PLxlSBzMcrtkMCVtuXEIz5BXpPfycTwsS5&index=7
I love how they can go back to their roots or evolve, but they never loose that beautiful characteristic sound.
Again the kind of music I put on at night and lay in the dark thinking of nothing but the music and the imagery it provokes <3 thank you for making my life better, b&s!!!
Just can't stop listening to it <3
Even a brand new song by you evokes a strong feeling of nostalgia in me 💛
3 days later, and I haven't been able to stop listening. This song grows in you, discreetly and without mercy...\n\nWell, most Belle & Sebastian does.
damm this is sweet
So I made the cover of this EP, the good looking one in the hat..
This is not nostalgia, it’s just a band doing the usual, without being affected by the poor music changes from the last 15 years
Omg this song is just as astonishing as Nobody's Empire 😍
it's like i'm watching life in a movie
Amazing work as always guys. Love it!
I'M IN LOVE
dig the song! here's a brief write-up we did about it https://zumic.com/ill-be-your-pilot-belle-and-sebastian-youtube-audio-single
I just loved it!
OMG new song!!  I love it
Can't wait to hear more!
Such a sweet song! Love you Belle and Sebastian 😚😍😘
Belle and Sebastian is Back!! *-* ..
It's just so lovely  and relaxing
❤❤❤❤❤ Thank u for making this
Man, this is beautiful.

Needs a stronger melody and Lying here in the sweet sahara is like something a sixth former in English class would write.\nB&S were always bitter-sweet, but this is just plain mawkish.\nI loved Nobody's Empire and some bits and pieces off the last few albums, but it does feel like they've kind of petered out creatively.
Beutiful 😍 Love it 😊 Come to Mexico someday please :3
Reminds me of the music from this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ocd1D8fwdjU
I love you, guys.
Nice try to retrieve some of your original sound. Utter failure though, atmosphere is lacking.
Can you have video making of selena Gomez pleeeaaaase
0:54 she spelled rihanna wrong😭😭😭
i just came across your channel and your personality is fun☺️💞 but i just kept finding myself back away from my phone cuz u just seem tooo close upppp...like your face& lashes are screaming at me...make sense? yes😳😳😬😜
It's funny. because Riri spent $10,000 on hers and you spent $100. and it looks like the same damn thing but only yours just look better lol ... don't get me wrong Riri is pretty but just because she got money don't mean she's the beautifulest  woman in the world. but what you got on look like the same thing she got on it's basically the same thing but only they put hers on the higher cost which should not even be that much in reality .... and you pulled that look off just like she pulled that look off ....😂😂😊
good job got to make one
Fashion Nova - Search Glammed out boots - silver $149 vs $10,000
5:05
She's what I'd expect snow white to sound like but without the bland personality.
Honestly your shoes looks much better than Riri's, I would buy your DIY... Gorgeous QUEEN
I’m a muffin angel pie
Those boots are so gorgeous ! And you are so beautiful 😍
hi amber i love you videos. you always make me happy. i love your channel because you have such a out of the box style ,but i love it! and trust me i'm broke to girl. thank you amber and keep being you!!!!!!!!
Omg girl you went from cold to in a bikini 😂 I love yooou
LMAO What in the heck is up with asking?? how much coffee did she drink? Amber didn't drink no damn coffee she's just a fun person that is not boring she's always excited and thats a good thing (Coffee is a Shitty hot drink) that has caffeine in it that keeps you wide awake and you can die from it because you drinking too much it's not Soda or Pepsi caffeine is like a drug in your drink you drink that all the time you'll never get any sleep you'll be high as a kite and you'll start to have body failure meaning your body will start shaking on its own people it's not a joke thing with Coffee=caffeine your killing your self slowly.
Please please please don't change
OMGGGGGG I love the Red💄💄💄💄you look so beautiful😍😍\nI can't wait to have enough money to go to California so I can go to all the stores you go to for your DIY's😇😇I have faith I'll make it to Cali and when I do (in my head) we will shop for only the best sales and 💍💎💎💎😂😂
She looks like the little girl from despicable me
3:05 wait it wouldn't be her what without it
Please make a DIY sexy Halloween costumes video !!!!
You literally crack me up.  You're blue coat comment had me dying!!!  Big fan of you silliness xx

The Velcro was a great idea
I can see my future in your lashes
It's so cute how she is still saying broke bitch even though she is at 1mil
I like your DIY better than the original tbh
Hey Amber u like gloves too?? I love ur outfits and shoes 😍😍😍😍😍
I just want start by saying thank you Amber ❤️ Because of you I finally got the courage to start my very own YouTube channel! Honestly if it wasn’t for me coming across your channel and spending hours watching your videos, I don’t think I would’ve ever started my channel (which was only about two weeks ago!!) You are just so genuine to your followers and I love you for that! 💕 So keep doing you boo and keep up the amazing work! 💋
Why does she have eyebrows on her lash line?
You should do something with the lashes. They don't look that pretty
I could be Bill Gates rich, and still wouldn't spend 10K on some boots.  DIY boots looked good.
I thought you were pregnant I’m confused I just started watching you
I hit the like button because i love you. The boots could've came out a little better,,, but you are my favorite still.
Are you ready for carli's launch!! Her shinny booties were made for you !! 😍✨
Please do a try on haul from carly bybel new collection with misguided😍😍😍😛😛
💎💎I just discovered you,and now I'm binge watching!!! and you're so adorable and I love how up heat and quirky you are!! you put me in a happy mood!! 💎💎never let anyone take that smile off your face 🙏

Waiting for the day that the E6000 glue company sponsors you... just waiting
Can you do a shopping challenge at Walmart or target?
I luv rihanna and amber at the same time and when I saw this video I clicked so fast the end tho
Amber any ideas on how to bling up some old Uggs?
Amber can you please make a video on how you fixed and made those shorts that was to small to  fit you :)
a website called fashion nova has some like rihannas for $150
Omg Amber you should start your own clothing line ❤
Lady you did a amazing job on these boots WOW 😳. Tfs
do swatches and tests of your mauve lip liner
I bought exact glue because of your videos and I found it to be the most horrible I’ve ever used😫 I don’t get it
I just found your channel, safe to say you're my favorite YouTuber now
I just love you 😩😩😩😩
YES girl! Love this. So sweet so cool
We need a full story
I love your vids Amber and have been watching them for a long time but this wasn't your best tbh. Felt really rushed and the result wasn't that great. ;_; sorry
I wish she would make a collab with Shane dawson that would be awsome
Regular Human : *Gets cold at home - put on  warm fuzzy robe* ; Fabulous Amber *Gets cold at home - puts on fabulous blue fur coat* 😍😍😍😍 I'm cry 😭😭😭
Amber, I had A HORRIBLE day today, I literally hit a few lows today, but I have to say your video was one of the few things to make me genuinely laugh and smile throughout the day. Thank you for being you <3 I hope we cross paths one day xx from NYC :)
you always have the best video ideas!!!
I wonder what Amber wore to prom and homecoming
The one you have look cute then riri's
Your thumbnail (on my iPad), your price is covered with the length time of the video
Amber. How. Do. You. Do. It!
I seriously think you can make  a successful comedy actress or an animation artist.lol
Please do the iconic Marilyn Monroe JFK dress.
Amber I wanna know where you got that black jacket😩
IM WATCHING THIS ON MY BIRTHDAY
Very creative and very artistic. Wow you are really amazing! Keep it up! ❤🙏🏼😘
amber you are awesome, but those boots are not.....
Where is her black jacket from?
So we just going to ignore the fact that we can see amber only wearing a bra & underwear through the mirror @ the background when she was showing us how the boots came out 😂😂  5:00-5:08
Windsor (a clothing line online) has a pair of shoes that are literally the exact same shoes Rihanna is wearing. They are $145 but still they’re cute
Wowwwy😍
I want those eyelashes 😍
it looks prety than rihanna's shoes

I am damn sure you been eating expired Pocky :D
I love the chocolate pocky
do the eat it or were it challange
HAS HE NOT REALIZED SRIRACHA IS AN OFFICIAL WORD IN THE DICTIONARY
Dave as an og parodian from 200k I have to say the quality of your content has gone down. You mainly just eat food and do arcade games. I mean I guess some people are interested in that stuff but the stuff you did before with alboe was a lot better. I have also noticed that your sub growth has slowed considerably. Before in 6 months you gained about 1 mil subs. Now after 6 months you barely grew 700k.
I say\n\n\n\n\n\n TAKE IT EASY!
I tried the green tea and it was a negative 100,000,000
The green tea and cookies and crème are my favorite
Lol I always eat Cookies and Cream Pocky 😅
Got enough ads?
ive tried the matcha ones but they look like the mango ones
I just for real love him so much
lets make a vid that is 11 minutes long and put 5 or 6 adds there REVENUE 101
Holyyyy fuck David you must try the new sizzerling salsa Doritos with cheese it’s a mussst I literally just had it it tastes peng as fuck 😱😱😨😱
Total Pockys of 18, 3 packages, 10 Pockys per package. \n\nNice Maths, David.
Angry hungry, yes I’m hangry\n\nBTS FANS WHERE YOU AT
…how is matcha green tea pocky third to last and cookies and cream fourth? Wtf
David there is Spicy nuggets at Burger King
Reminds me of the munchpak vids those were OG
My friend is in la
I love the almond crush ones there my favorite! I get them everytime
is extras kendricks favorite world?
King Kendrick
hook melody sounds like an old 50 cent
That cover is a picture of George W. Bush who lived in Compton for 6 months.
Bruh Kendrick is on some other shit 🔥🔥🔥
DOPE Yg Hootie Feat. the King
The City from the Game and Kendrick was superior.
I dont know when people gon realize Kendrick do what he want he just dropped a dope verse for Rapsody everything ain't gon be a control verse. Just know he can when called for
only came here for kenny
Snapchat anyone?
HAVEN'T EVEN LISTENED AND I KNOW IT WILL BE FIRE
Brah the chorus is so simple yet so dope! btw Feel free to check out our reaction to this gr8 song over on our channel
My nigga Kendrick
damn too hype way to hype
This song is fire
here before 1M? I must be dreaming...
THE CITY FROM GAME MURDERS THIS NO SKI MASK
I wish they didn't add that echo to Kendrick's verse. It's hard to hear the last words.
I used to get YG Hootie and YG mixed up since they from Compton but this is a solid track. Y'all hating on the Kendrick verse? It isn't GOAT but its fairly solid. He did his thing.
haven`t even listening but i know kdot`s verse will be fire
This is ok but kdot need to rap more💯
This shit was gay af
I've been a mogul...,I am an enterprise
KDOT ALBUM
Trust. 🔥
oooo Fuck🔥🔥🔥
Ten Toes Down TTD
Fresh before 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯👏🏽💯
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Motivation
OU MAN, FIRST COMMENT
GOAT
Who this dude in the picture
is that george bush???
Compton/Lynwood!!
I'm a big Kendrick fan but I'm not feeling this. Usually Kendrick saves the track for me, not here.
What is the sample? That sound at 1:13 reminds me of an old school Eazy-E song
Dope!
🔥🔥🔥
why do I feel like caketendo would enjoy this
🔥🔥🔥 From the West Side!
Trash i dont even want to smoke loud to this smh Kendrick going garbage juice #mytrueoption
k.dot saved the track......
okey
FIRST, SECOND, THIRD AND FOURTH
hi tati...  plz try out the .... MatchCo app, a custom foundation-matching app! ..
Update skincare routine please
It still exists! http://fionastilesbeauty.com/
But Tati... where's your Chantecaille?!
Tati! there is a website called shophush and they offer incredibly cheap makeup and eyeshadow palettes, some that look like doupes for almost all popular eyeshadow palettes and I would love it if you could do a review on some of them :)
i'm surprised by the lack of maybelline :0
Tati can you do foundation fave and hate? Also skincare too. I’m looking for it. Hope you can saw this :)
The best thing to finish the day with ❤️
That was really informative 👌 thanks Tati
The lash paradise is everything
Love it !!!
Tati is the definition of classy!!! 😍😍 LOVE YOU GIRL!!
wait what happened to the benefit mascara?
Do a giveaway Tati .
💙💙💙💙💙💙
Fantastic job Tati! I love these videos!!
Please do a lipstick purge video
Love the dior iconic overcurl mascara is amazing 😍😍
Still waiting for Tati to make a video so we can see all the crazy mascaras. 🤔🙄
Fiona Stiles is on QVC!!    Soooo happy!
Tati u r so pretty
new essence products review plssss
Marc Jacobs and Lash Paradise both 👌🏻👌🏻
Versus firm jeans avsdfn else question drain personality processing uncertainty reporting.
Eyeliner pls!!!
no ads...no ads..no ads👆
Love your eye look! Tutorial please!
your makeup is even better than usual in this video if that is even possible! so stunning!!
The description box actually made me crack up laughing! You know you have too much mascara when you can't even list all of them in the description box <3
HOLY! Loved this video, big thumbs up! Yes do this with your other makeup products! maybe palettes? snap family!
you should do a video using an actual aloe vera plant as a primer!
Idk why but i really want to highlight her collar bone
proud of you! you downsizing motivates all of us to do the same\n!
Tati you need to try the dark blue version of the Catrice Glam&Doll, it's mind blowing
When you donate, where do you donate to? I lost all of my makeup collection in a house fire. I’m a MUA and it’s so upsetting. I love you Tati! I learn a lot from you!
somewhere in the distance bella hadid is crying over tati hating dior pump n volume
Why did she not keep the Roller Lash ? She said she was but in the final basket she didn't say she kept it
I think this is the prettiest makeup I've ever seen on you.
Will you be reviewing the new Charlotte tilbury palette?
TATI!! I would love to see you test out Ciate London’s new glitter flip lip. It starts out as a matte lipstick but when you rub your lips together it turns into glitter!
Hey Tati, can you do a review on the Luxe Glitz Palette by Jolie Beauty??
Can u help me with makeup...i have blonde hair, blue eyes and very light eyebrows 😁😁
Love your lips and face makeup, hate it your eye makeup look too powdery and chalky... BTW you should comment all the products mention and pin it
If your mascara wand is one that isn’t plastic, one that is fluffy, you can usually bend them to reach all of your lashes perfectly. Just bend the tip of the wand on the opening of the tube. It’s such a good little trick I’ve accidentally tried!
Love the eye look!!
Tati's makeup is especially bright in this vid. Love it ❤
Hey Tati, I know this is weird but talking about lashes. I'm struggling to find one that curls my lashes all the way through the lash line. I have slightly hooded eyes like you, every curler I've tried doesn't curl my outer corner lashes because it touches my eye bone and it doesn't reach them, it's so annoying! What eyelash curler do you use? Or do you know some good ones for hooded eyes? \n\nLove you! ❤️\nAnd thanks for the help in advance.
Oh, who’s the mystery helper??
What lighting do you use other than natural lighting
I always love when you do a big declutter haul. It would be great if you could go through your best black eyeliners (eyeliners in general, water line, etc), and winter skincare routine! xoxo
Omg i have just saw more mascaras than i used in my entire life!
It’s amazing that beauty gurus have an almost textbook memory for products they’ve tried. Like Tati just rattled off mini reviews almost for like 100 products! It’s kind of impressive she remembers specific experiences with all of those.
superhero is my fav!! monsuir big is alright dont think its worth the money plenty of better drugstore options. tartiest is awesome def my second fav.
Donate to me😣😣😣😣
Airtouch rotating makeup brush hsn
Impressed by not keeping 101 and keeping 15, wow!
I Looooooooved the look so chiiiiiiic
Yes do one or eyeliners😁😁❤❤❤
tarantula on your eyeball ... Loved that, Tati!!
Who's Taylor?
You look stunning Tati!
I got the 1.0 percent of her collection :(\nYeah, only one mascara 😂
you should try soap and glory's golden tube mascara!
Hi Tati. Can you please do one one primer and setting sprays together? Thanks Tati❤️
I'm so poorly just watched 10 of your videos you're getting me through. I love you Tati 💕
Is it possible to create a list in the description box of what you keep for these kinds of videos, as a quick reference guide for when we next go to purchase a product.
Love your tutorials. Can you do a tutorial with zoeva products?
Can you try catch it 🤣😝 x x x
Tati could you please review essence products? As always you look stunning love you so much ❤❤❤❤
Loling at the Too Face throw 😂
I love these videos!!
Tati? You don't have any Toofaced products? You should do a full face of Toofaced. 🙂
do it again, any product loved it Tati xoxo from Canada
Tati, we need a makeup set up tour!!!! I wanna know how your organize your makeup drawers/ how you sort and store them.
You can buy Fiona stiles at their website
I love when you do these and go through everything, I bring a pen & paper to the table and write down things to maybe try. The only thing that kinda stinks is since you put the name of the products before you say whether you like it or not, I end up having to pause and rewind to catch the name again but that's okay <3 Thanks for a great video
I love you so much Tati ❣️❣️
That glittery lower lash eyeshadow...and the red lip we and James love! 😍
I would like to see some recent skin care routine
Tati, can we get a perfume haul....PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!!!
lol I love when Tati came across the T** Faced products
Wowa, you are so beautiful today!
HI Tati, question, do you use like visine or something else to make the white of your eyes soooooo white?
I like the revlon red lid formula but i didn't like the brush it was so scratchy.
Could you try catching it tho??? thanks \nI died!
You look stunning!! I love what you did with your eyes, and that red lip is perfect. <3
You’ve inspired me to get rid of things. Thank you
I would LOVE if you did this 'spring cleaning' with eyeliners! I'm Asian, so I monolid horribly, and really really need a budgeproof smudge free eyeliner for my oily lids. It always comes down and makes raccoon eyes, and I've tried at least 6 different drugstore liners and none of them have done it for me yet.
When you do these videos could you compile a pdf of all the products that you liked that worked for you, and ones that didn’t work for you, since In your description box you can’t list all of them. I would love to know all the ones you like, especially the affordable ones! Thanks love💕 keep slaying 💁🏻🔥
Tati you should do this with eyeliners. Need a good drugstore one that doesn't run.
Love to see more videos like this❤
We are so proud of you too, I need to do that with my makeup collection
Love that your just as equally excited about essence as you were about Marc jacobs
Great Video!! Love these makeup graveyard Videos 👍👍👍\n\nHey everyone I would love it if you check out my instagram page my.makeup.goods 😊 I would really appreciate your support😘
Loooooooove your earrings where did you get them??
what are your opinions on merle norman?
Tati:  Where do you donate your items to?
I only have one muscara from essence \nYour lucky to own all of that
who is taylor?
But what about better than sex and Lights camera lashes :o

MASSIVE Thank you for everyone supporting me and making a dream reality! TG
What a sound guy .
Some really good stuff in this podcast
One of the best podcasts so far, amazing
Find it kinda funny that the two fights shearer witnessed included former Leeds players haha, once Leeds always Leeds I guess
So they're talking about Rafa, how he stayed, how he's brought them back to the premier league then Lawrence is like so what influenced u to retire Alan I'm sat here gripped with them talking about Rafa and he just back tracks, like, do u even know what you're doing m8? Wtf?
i very much enjoyed this interview with Alan Shearer. Made me remember when i was a young lad when i used to support Man Utd Lol
True Geordie has come a long way, he has to be hitting the 1m sometime in the next year.
Class!!! Shearer was my hero growing up and hearing him speak about all the things you want to know about is quality... cheers for an amazing interview.
Also sry my name is adam I don't have a YouTube account I am using my wifes account 👍
I just love Shearer, everything about the man.
So happy  that you finally had your hero on the podcast
What a wonderful podcast. Excellent work guys!!
unliked so i could like this video twice. mad respect geordie
Wish me Dad was alive to watch this he would of loved this :) proud to be a geordie awesome podcast mate glad you met your childhood hero nice one :)
Brilliant interview!! I think Graeme Souness was the manager at the time of the Boyer v Dyer fight? Al said Sir Bobby would have been disappointed.
That was good stuff with the legend :)
Well that will never be topped TG. Meeting your boyhood idol. Well done . Howay the lads
Louis Theroux would be class to get on 👌🏻👍🏻
Should have asked his why didn’t he by the lads season tickets on purely belter
I've absolutely loved this interview, absolute CREDIT - to all 3 of you. A really well structured interview.\nWe all adore big Al, but we've passed judgement on his persona without really getting to know him. I think he bared his arse for us more than he had to - much respect.\nI love NUFC and I love Alan Shearer
why did you make it look like an interview
Great video but whos that other awkward chavy next to geordie
crystal palace are shit might come back to haunt you
Can anyone pinpoint the keane point
absolutely loved this best podcast I've ever seen no doubt
You know what. I'd love to see Geordie have a podcast with Lee Cattermole.
Great to see you talk with your hero.
I loved when he said Bellamy was tiny and then Lawrence’s laugh was delayed and then he became serious instantly after
Wow mate, I used to watch you playing Fifa career mode like 2-3 years ago. Unbelievable. Congratulations my friend and keep this up. Some more Footballer podcasts are needed!! Keep up the good work.
quality interview mate , genuine honest and interesting , lost in todays society not just football
Gowan geordie maybe one day I could interview you ! You interviewed your hero and what a podcast it made ! Keep it up this is just the beginning of what's to come ! 💙
Great Podcast! Think you should have hat films on the podcast they are youtubers as well and think it would be a hell of a laugh
Where are the fucking football hangovers?
Can anyone with asthma answer this survey please. This is for my dissertation and everything will be kept anonymous. THANK YOU \nhttps://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/6S2XZ9D
Terrific podcast, really enjoyed it, keep up the good work lad.
What a brilliant Interview. No punches pulled and raw AF. Loved it TG
can you do one about the big man's tattoo's..?..and another one about lawrence dick...oh no..that would only last 2 minutes...!!
Amazing podcast! Try and get Kai Greene on, that would be sick!
class podcast genuinely proud to have been a fan for a long time. MICHAEL DAPAH or MR TRAUMATIC would be great guests
I know most people wouldn't like this comparison , but Alan Shearer looks a lot like Fred Durst to me
So happy for you!!!
Never really thought much of Alan Shearer, other than he was an incredible striker. Watched the full 2 hours and I think he came across really well. Good interview.
Talking about Leicester aswell. I'm in love. Shearer knows what we did was something to never be repeated.
As A Boro fan ... Enjoyed that ..I met Alan a few times when he lived next door to my freind in Wynyard ( Kenny Lowe now manager of Perth Glory ) Had a party one night and all the guys had come in Fancy Dress ,,,Well TBH dressed a women !!! Mr Shearer turned up in a lovely silver dress !!! He is good craic , Comes accross different on the TV ....England legend
Well done Geordie , good on you mate !
Respect man... Ive been subscribed to you since 2014 and to see how far you’ve come on YouTube is absolutely great. You’re my favourite YouTuber and you deserve all the great stuff that comes your way
Sir Bobby Robson wasnt in charge when bowyer and dyer had a fight it was soueness lol
Did they turn Laurence's mic off
My Idol as well mate, watched him when I was younger on the telly. What an experience that would've been Geordie!
This is a great interview.  Shearer is my favourite English striker, and the best that I have been play.  I am happy to see True Geordie interview his hero and keep it real.
Was very touched by this interview. I think TTG knows how much this means to all football fans in the area. Love.
missed this for ages.. great content. brilliant interview, (Barnsley fan)
Shearer is such a gentleman, no attitude issues or self-worship like a lot of the footballers have.
So happy willne shouted this vid out in his twoti vid cause it didnt show up in my recommended
What is the name of the song at the start ?
Got emotional when talking about speed. RIP speedo I remember the day he died I just finished a Sunday league game was devastated
it's sad to know that if truegeordie was a 5' 6'' matchstick with exactly the same mindset and views, he'd have like 10% of his current view pool\n\nanyway, there's always Iniesta =))
My mum dated Keith Gillespie when she was like 20
One of the best interviews on you tube awesome well done.
legendddd
Interview with Willne’s dad
Absolutely Class podcast mate, congratulations on realizing a dream TG, as a Newcastle fan, this was amazing to listen to.
Shearer was a TOP class centre forward who scored all types of goals and was infact underrated.
It's all about money, tell me I'm wrong.
Shearer was a big part of why i started following NUFC, what a player. Great man too. Loved seeing TTG get the chance to meet one of his idols too. Great stuff. Keep at it fella. HWTL
Well in, TG. Happy for you. Being one of the realest youtubers out there, you immensely deserved this. The podcast was quite enjoyable and it was great to hear personal stories from Alan. Long may the King in the North reign. Your Empire shall hopefully soon have 1 million citizens
I am a Liverpool fan and I was so happy he turned down Man utd to go Newcastle and respect to him to turning so surely so many trophies to go to his boyhood club,he was a great player same never won a trophy with you.
As a fellow Newcastle fan, great to see you meeting your idol, such a nice, down to earth guy 👍🏻
Never watched a YouTube video for more than 15 mins.....until now. Shearer is a class act and great interview kid.
BEST VIDEO EVER!!!! nice to hear a few hope truths from wor al such a professional my brothers want to play for Newcastle and they graft there arses off every weekend please try and get my hero on Peter Beardsley for a talk  would be great to hear from him thanks guys keep the vids coming thick and fast C,MON THE TOON!
Absolutely brilliant TG. Big follower anyways, but what a two hours. Gripping stuff. Mr Shearer is a true ledge of the English game and gave me fantastic enjoyment down the years. He put a 'shift' in here too. And he pulls no punches. Cheers guys. Manc Red since 79 n all. Keep up the gud work lad.
This is one of the best yet, i feel like i say that every week. TTGP doesn't set the bar....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHEY ARE THE BAR!!
Very emotional last part. But so happy to see my favourite YouTuber make it even bigger than before
Being a Blackburn fan it was great hearing about the good old days. Fantastic podcast as always Geordie keep it up. #VenkysOut
Nigga we made it
Fantastic watch . Thankyou
Hearing Alan Shearer swear is weird

The way the Geordie looks at the gay dude is so sweet. Great that these two are showing such a positive side of homosexual relationships. Well done!!!
as a Cork City born, American, who follows the 'Pool.     I love this, this is exceptional love of the game shit..... Respect big lad, I know what it means to you. Good work.
What a humble man Alan Shearer is.. He's also a straight talker, no bullshit and says exactly what he thinks. Not even a fan of Newcastle or shy of the teams he played for but so much respect for a good guy 👍\nMan I'd love a two hour podcast if you could get Paul Gascoigne on, imagine the stories he could tell lol.
Wish I could speak Newcastle so I could understand them :(
Swear on my life im related to the Physio Paul Ferris< my second name is Ferris and hes my dads uncle and my uncle stopped Roy Keane from battering Alan after a united match
Next...Kevin Keegan...Rob Lee...and when he leaves the employment of Mike Ashley...Peter Beardsley...make these interviews happen
Okay this was very needed. Thank you so much.
You wanna love yo self, you gotta date yo self honey! Hahah GOLD!! Ps you're an adorable human and I love this video.
So I need that mug
“Go get some exercise” does walking to McDonald’s count lol
Like,,,HOW is it possible i could love you more than I already do but THAT CLIP OF YOU SINGING NEXT TO NORMAL. DEAD.
I had a bad day and this helped so thank you💕✨
I find the best thing I do to help my mental health is cut out all (most) self deprecating humor. If someone else talked to me in the same way that I thought of myself I would not be friends with that person. It pays to be your own best friend and not worst critic.
Cayleigh for real this is fucking brilliant advice, what a fab video x
I appreciate your Josie reference
We're not in the dark timeline, we're in *the darkest timeline*! D:

I give myself support even tho I feel like a freak for going to online uni because of social anxiety
you tell your self that your amazing and that you love you self even if you don't believe it you just say it and it helps i think i don't even know
Something that personally helps me is playing music/writing music but that’s a ~me~ thing. Also jamming to La La Land cause I’m a basic white girl
ah man i wish wine still helped rather than making everything worse, those were the days lol
Your bathtub is yuuuuugeee
1:03 holy shit that reference. this is why you're my favourite

Self-care suggestion: Watching Ron Swanson compilation videos while eating steak
This video is wonderful, thanks Simon. My mental health is bit of a dumpster fire at the moment and all these world mental health day discussions are catching me off guard, but I think are exactly what I need, if that makes sense. Midwinter was a book that destroyed me, and I didn't even have the personal connection you did - there's just something so vulnerable and beautiful about a book that expresses sadness that well. I read my favorite book (The Mill on the Floss) when I was going through a rough patch, and it just articulated things inside me that I'd never thought were important enough to be captured on paper. Anyway, going off on my own tangents now, thanks again for your thoughts
From a person who suffers with mental health issues I send you much love Simon. Thank you. 💚
Great video Simon and thank you for sharing your mental health story with us. I absolutely agree that books can help with some mental health symptoms/ situations. I suffer from anxiety and depression, with some periods of my life the depression was more intense and others the anxiety was more intense. I still get anxious about work related things or personal relationship where I feel that I didn't do something right or good enough and will go over it in my head. I have learned that I need to debrief at the end of the day by having time to escape into a book and have a cup of tea. This helps me to get away for a bit and not dwell on things that can be irrational. I think this was a helpful video and was great to hear how books assisted you through some of your mental health situations.
Simon thank you so much for this video and your honesty in it. Books have definitely helped my mental health in terms of self help books building up my self esteem and resilience, but also like you say getting lost in fiction. The times when my physical health has been really bad I don't know what I would have done without books - I so needed that escape. Thanks again for this video xx
I am glad that you bothered. Beautiful video. Thanks so much for sharing.
Simon I love your wise words. I always look forward to watching you, and hearing about book selections. Great video.
Can I just say that hearing your wonderful voice always makes me feel better! I had a period of stress related mental illness in 2014 and sadly it affected my ability to concentrate on books. Nothing worked and only gradually has my concentration improved. It's still not back where it was, but is much better. Your video is excellent in that it shows people that bad things can happen to good people and we never know what someone else is going through. People do care though and book clubs are excellent places to find non judgemental friends!
Thank you for this video! You bring brightness in my life, I love to listen to you speak about books, or other things, it's always funny and/or interesting. \nI often feel lonely - even if I'm not alone -, but I love to be alone sometimes, which I thought was a bit weird of me. You speaking about it makes me realise I'm not the only one feeling like this, and it really helps! \nBooks have helped me through life, when I was lonely, when I felt rejected, when my parents divorced - I was too young and didn't understand, thought it was my fault in fact -, and they still do now, when I feel anxious, or unloved. I know I'll always be a bit weird, but it is a thing I must accept and live with, a part of me. \nThank you once more, it was great of you to make this video, really!
Thanks for making this video, and being so open about your past experiences. This video has definitely helped me! :) xxx
Fantastic video!  Thank you for sharing.
I think this was a good video. It is a personal thing indeed but I think that readers, or rather big readers are often people who have experienced mental health issues and have found solace in books. In 2005, there was a summer I would come home every day from work, go to bed curl up with a Jane Austen, I read all her books a couple of times that summer and Persuasion I read more than 10 times that August. I was in a very bad place and somehow Austen just got it. And then slowly I got better.
This video and your honesty with us was exactly what I needed right now, Simon! Thank you very much!
Thanks for this Simon, it's always reassuring to hear other people talk about going through the same/similar things as I have. Books are definitely a solace. When I feel in need of comfort I read Nancy Drew mysteries as they take me back to childhood!
Thank you for making this video! Reading and books have always been there for me when my depression is bad.
Thank you so so so much for posting this Simon! As someone who has suffered from depression and anxiety in the past I think its so important to us all to talk about it and know we are not alone. I think books of all kinds can not only be therapeutic for us when we are going through a difficult time mentally but also physically. I know myself when my physical health has been bad it then has had a knock on effect on my mental health-reading has helped me escape for a while when physically the only choice ive had is to rest, read and escape! :)  Thanks again -you're a gem! or a gem of a bear you might say! :) xoxx
Reading can make you escape in the darkest of times. I feel that's what's informed my reading from a young age and what let me find fantasy novels as an escape from reality since a young age. Thanks for making this video and opening up a discussion!
Ahh I love the video!
Thank you for sharing, Simon! As someone who is suffering a great deal from a debilitating  mix of depression, anxiety  and stress, I felt a lot better just to listen to another person who has been through it before. It made me feel less lonely and really hopeful about overcoming it all.
Thank you so much, Simon! It is really helps.\nI've just started to take meds for depression last week, finally gave in =D. Mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, also fear of death, etc. have been with me from teen years, more than a decade already, and well, it is hard. At the moment I'm winning, because I've learnt how calm myself, even without meds (internal dialogue). Movies, TV shows and sleep are my other treatment. Unfortinately, I have this problem when I can't really concentrate if I feel sad or am caught in a loop of depressive thoughts, so I can't read. Hope that this tendency will pass with time.\nLots of love to you. Stay strong!
This was a wonderful video, Simon.  Thanks for your honesty in sharing your mental health experiences.  I often have suffered from hormonal depression, but never to the extent that is was an issue for me.  \nReading has been a lifeline for me when I have been through some pretty horrible experiences.  I don't have too many memories of before I was 11 when my parents split up.  Reading was my saviour then.  I was sexually abused for about 5 years in my early teen years, and later on my stepfather was a horribly abusive alcoholic.  Throughout all those years reading was my safe place - and it continues to the place where I feel least threatened by the world, where I feel the safest, where I feel I belong and where I don't have to do anything or be anyone but myself.  \nNowadays my own life is a lot less harrowing but my 31 year old son suffers from schizophrenia and my daughter has been diagnosed with clinical depression as well as fibromyalgia so mental health is very close and all around me.\nYou and I have vastly different tastes in reading - I am a popular fiction reader through and through, but your channel is such a welcome relief from all the noise noise noise that goes on in this world.  You are a lovely man and I always look forward to your name popping up in my subscription feed.  Thank you for your content and I wish you nothing but wellness and happiness.  Love from NZ
Lovely video Simon; I appreciate your honesty about mental health.  I needed this, as I am a bit shaky in the mental health department right now. I would like to hear your review of A Line Made by Walking.
Simon, thank you so much for this video! I've been going through a bad patch lately, and have been for pretty much this whole year, but I've found myself reading a ton lately and it has helped me so much. Books really can act as an escape and a way to not have to think about what's going on around you for a bit. I've truly found that books have helped me tons over the years I've been an avid reader.
Thanks so much for creating and sharing this video. I was completed sucked in, and enjoyed the bits you would have edited out - love seeing that stuff. On the topic of dealing with grief, have you read H is for Hawk? I own a copy, but haven't read it yet, but it generally comes up a lot on the topic of grief and processing change, etc. and comes highly recommended from the BookRiot gang. Anyway, I really appreciate this video, and generally, your videos are always a bright spot in my day no matter how things are going. Thank you!
Thank you so much for making this video and being so open. I work as a mental health therapist and I’m often talking to people about what they are reading and how it helps. It is definitely something people struggle with more than we know. I truly believe every time someone shares their story they make someone else feel more “normal”. Thank you for being brave.
So needed, great video.
This video is wonderful, I've been feeling down lately and your videos always cheer me up. It's wonderful to see more people talking about mental health.
Was having a terrible day today (just woke up like that) and this was great to see. Didn't even know i needed it until I clicked. Thanks x
I don't have a lot to contribute to the conversation, but I really loved this video.
Suffering from mood swings since going through menopause, I know exactly what you mean and you're right, reading helps!! Watching book tube videos helps. But I have phases when I can't read depressing stories or very suspenseful stories but there are a lot of other books I can read instead! Thank you for be so honest about your problems.
Thanks for sharing, I send you lots of love and hugs simon. xxxx
I wish I could 'love' this video. *massive virtual squeeze*
You are wonderful and life affirming and a joy! Thank you for all your vlogs but especially this one.  You said so much that i am going to ponder over. A couple of things about reading helping mental health in my experience: depression is exhausting and especially talking to people during depression is just too much effort. I crave silence at that time but as yiu say that can cut you off. But you can read, think, and in a way interact while being silent when yiu read. Also reading is like exercise or maintenance for the emotions and mind on a daily basis. We develop and hone our responses and capacity for imagination and empathy while we read and that pays off in hard times.
I recognized what I interpret as nerves near the end about sharing this, and I just wanted to say that I am glad you did.
That is such a touching story (I'm at the story of 10 year old Simon) and I'm sending you good thoughts.
Can I give this video like milion thumbs up...?
Wow, great video Simon. I loved reading A Line Made by Walking and Midwinter too and it's so moving hearing how you connected with them personally.
Thank you Simon for this video. I suppose it was really hard to talk about it, for that reason I even more appreciate you shared your experiences with us. Sure it will provide help/support to others. Thank you again :)\n\nPS. You are absolutely right, your channel  does bring happy moments :)))) (plus some serious added value as well)
A wonderful video thank you! I appreciate all you've done and said. Sending you love
Powerful. This is a video I shall return to again and again. ❤️
Thank you so much for your brave video. Really honest, vulnerable and important! Wanted to give you a big hug at the end :)
I am really glad you decided to upload this video. We do share some similar experiences, especially regarding grief, so, as you said, it‘s so helpful to know you‘re not alone.
This was a truly lovely video Simon. Thanks for sharing. Reading is generally speaking a source of stress relief for me, but as you said it can also be a balm in terms of finding others (whether fictional or not) that have had shared experiences. I have gone through one or two periods of intense anxiety and that actually makes it really hard to focus on reading. I've found that audio books are actually better when you have too much nervous energy so that you can take walks or run or whatnot and at the same time listen to a story. Stories can really help draw the mind away from negative loops and focus on something else.
Thanks so much for doing this video and for being so open. I can relate to what you were saying about reading being helpful for your mental health and comforting you through tough times. although it's only this year that I have returned to reading & found book tube and it has a been a real comfort and life saver for me. I have read 80 books since May when I started reading again and I can't believe that I stopped reading for 7 years!!! Thanks again for sharing 😍
Thank you so much for this video!! I live with a mental health condition and at its worst it makes me very socially isolated (nature of the beast innit?) but books have always kept me feeling connected to the world, at least in some small way and have proved invaluable. I've always loved the Jeanette Winterson quote Art is an air pocket in an upturned boat,  that's what books have been for me. Also - sometimes if I struggle to engage with the world and have to retreat for a while, when I start to feel ready to re-connect I find spending some time knitting (other crafty pursuits are available! ;) and watching a backlog of booktube videos enormously therapeutic. It allows me that 'halfway house' of feeling like I'm hanging out with lovely people while not having the immediate pressures that socialising entails. So, yes, thanks, loved your unedited honesty - wonderful video!
Thanks Simon you probably just helped a lot of people.
This is great. I have a mental health blog and agree, although I am not a doctor, just sharing what works for me does help people so thank you. And thank you for talking about MH too! I would love a goldsmiths video and or a line made by walking video. All of the videos. ALSO. Can you tell us when the dates for the costa are? Like longlist and shortlist and announcements? I can't find it anywhere but I might just be being silly. Xxx
Thanks so much Simon, I found that really helpful. I started reading again because of grief, my daughter died. I found comfort and understanding in books. It helped me comprehend what my family and I was going through. I still look out for good grief stories.
This is wonderful. I needed this video right now.  Thank you thank you thank you.
Fantastic video. I've also had issues in the past, and often still struggle with anxiety, it's great to hear people speaking openly about these things. I also think books definitely help. I'm a bit of an introvert (like a lot of bookish people I suppose) and have a tendency to isolate myself. I went to a talk last night and Ali Smith mentioned isolation and reading, how you can feel alone and go and sit by yourself in a room, but as soon as you open a book that room fills with people.
Thank you for sharing your own experiences Simon .Reading helps me escape. 👍sleeping helps too. XXX
There was one book I picked up after my brother died that helped me a lot.  The best part of this book was being told to acknowledge your feelings and allow them to be...for a bit.  It was also good to have an activity to do, something that made me feel like I was doing something to dig out of my pit because the book actually has tasks to work through.   I still grieve for him 12 years later but it doesn't take me into the pit of hell when it comes over me now.  The Grief Recovery Handbook  by  John W. James, Russell Friedman
This is one of my favourite videos of yours. Thank you for addressing this difficult topic that's also been/is very present in my life, and for being so vulnerable and honest! I'm going to try and get my hands on a copy of A Line Made By Walking asap. Thanks for doing so much good, Simon! x
Great video! And what an important topic!\n\nMy first major downward spiral was about 12 yrs ago. I had just discovered Audible and, wanting the biggest bang for my buck, I searched for the longest books with the best ratings. I stumbled onto Outlander by Diana Gabaldon and was instantly captivated by Davina Porter's narration and the main character of Claire. Davina's Claire became my best friend. She was smart and tough and I just fell into her story. Reading was definitely an escape from terrible things going on in my real life but also gave me a reason to hang in there through each day so I could listen to the next chapter at bedtime. That book is 40+ hours long so it lasted many many days. And there are a ton of sequels. I'm not exaggerating when I say that Claire saved my life. Eventually I made my way to therapy and a good doctor. But I'd never have made it that far if it weren't for that book that just hooked me. I hope everyone who struggles with depression finds a book, or many books, to fall into one day at a time.\n\nOn a side note, you are looking particularly handsome today Simon! (Swear I'm not a stalker. Just speaking the truth 😊)
Brave video Simon, and beautifully delivered.  I also like to be alone, but not lonely, and given my physical isolation, I feel like my Booktube family are my most important and easiest to access portal to a social life with like-minded people.  I'm in a beautiful place and mostly thrive on the isolation, but some days I'm so glad when you pop in for a chat.  You are funny and wise and self-deprecating, such good qualities in an imaginary friend.\n\nOddly enough, I've just begun reading a short story in bed at night before going to sleep and it helps enormously.  I'm currently reading 'The Day I Ate Whatever I Wanted'  by Elizabeth Berg and it's very good.\n\nIncidentally, I've also just finished Tin Man (recommended by you and others).  Absolute heartbreaker and I loved it.  Thanks for the chat.
Wonderful video, Simon. Hugs and more hugs.
You are such a good egg Simon, you really are. Talking about mental health needs to be continually kept relevant. I can't even talk about the things which have effected my mental health in the past ... you are very brave xx
Thank you so much Simon. This was a wonderful video! I truly appreciate your openness. My aunt introduced me to Will Schwalbe's beautiful book.  I've also read his more recent work, Books for Living.  He is a wonderful bookish companion. I cannot imagine a life without books. I find such solace in reading. Thank you again for sharing your own experience.
amen....to all the here's to's that you mentioned..and here's to sharing as best we can and here's to you simon for your generosity in creating this video.
Best video yet! Thank you for sharing your very personal story. I can relate. I’ve had anxiety for a long time and my depression spurts come and go as well. I agree that books can be a form of escapism. Reading them as well as just wandering around bookshops works for me. I also have a rather large dvd collection if I need a quick escape fix. I also think is true that every once in a while we find a book that speaks to us and leaves us all a little less lonely. All my best to you!
It is an amazing gift you've given us by sharing your journey - calmly, kindly, warmly. With regards to the grief, A Year of Magical Thinking, by Joan Didion, made me realize I wasn't alone.
Thank you for sharing. I think we put so much emphasis on being yourself and uniqueness in general that we forget how important and comforting it is to be reminded that, in the end, we're actually not so unique. I am not the only person in the world experiencing a problem. Someone else has been there. You are not alone. Someone else has felt that. Etc.
Thanks for such a wonderful video Simon! Mental health is exactly what you said, something that we need not be afraid to talk about! I'm so glad to hear that you liked A Line Made by Walking. I was recently able to pick it up for only a few dollars as an ebook. I'm really looking forward to getting to it!
I don't even know where to start with this comment - I have been binge watching BookTube today and thinking about starting my own and I come across your channel at 1:30am - firstly it's lovely to find a fellow Brit, secondly, it's lovely to see someone my age and thirdly, I think you are basically the male version of me!  (I should state I love ALL BookTubers, but meeting a Brit the same age as me has given me renewed hope that I can indeed give this a go!\n\nI smiled, I LOL'd and I teared up watching this.  I haven't ben through anything like what you have but so much of your journey sounds like mine - I loved it when you said I don't like feeling lonely but I quite like being alone. this is something I have struggled to get other people to understand so it is refreshing to hear someone else say it.  And I totally, TOTALLY have the paranoia thing too, in fact it's what caused me to lose a job 18 months ago .. well that an the panic attacks I was having almost daily (mostly due to the paranoia and anxiety I experienced in my role and at the place I worked,\n\nThank you so much for opening up so honestly and eloquently (tangents are fun). I shall stop here otherwise .. well it's nearly 2am now and I really should get to bed ..!\n\nPS - you have a new stalker ;)
Thank you for this heartfelt video. When my sin died I spent a lot of time with Jane Austen. I know those characters/people so well and they never let me down. I didn't want any surprises or mysteries just good writing and friends (well, Elizabeth Bennet is my friend!). Thanks again.
Excellent video, Simon. I'm sure that wasn't easy to share such personal moments but thank you for sharing your story with us. I think so many of us have suffered at one time in our lives with mental health, but it's so great to see so many people opening up about their struggles and breaking the stigma against mental illness. I can't think of any books in particular that have helped me through a particularly rough patch, but I definitely turn to books (and booktube!) as a source of comfort or distraction when life gets hard.
Thank you for sharing this video it really helped. I suffer with mental health and it's nice to hear that I'm not alone in how I'm feeling
thanks for sharing your experiences, Simon. I think videos like this always, always help! glad you decided to make it :)
Thank you for sharing! I think it’s hard to share something so personal. I have suffered with depression and anxiety for years. It’s been fine for awhile, but I lost my dad in December last year which triggered my depression. I have struggled all year. The reason I’ve said this is because I’ve tried to read for escape, but it is just not working for me. I’ve been in the biggest slumpiest slump of my life since he got sick in November of last year. I’ve read 30 books. I’ve probably started and put down 100. It’s just so frustrating because I want to read, but I just can’t. I’m hoping to pull out of it soon because I agree with you that it is good for depression.
Thanks for such a personal video Simon, it's actually really refreshing. I've never really thought of reading and how it relates or influences my mental health before, but I now realise that I am someone who, when lonely or depressed, either obsessively reads or gets in the biggest slump ever. There is no in between. \nThe specific books I read also tend to influence my mental health, as some books really give me a real 'high' (mostly because they're just really good books), whilst others really depress me. And I don't even always know specifically why a book has had a negative influence on my mental health, so that's a bit annoying.\nI can see how this video (and others) may feel like therapy, as just reflecting on such things in my mind sort of felt like therapy, haha.\nI'm really intrigued by A Line Made by Walking, but I feel like I may relate to it more if I read it in a couple of years, so I'm in doubt whether or not to buy it..
I have the same issue. Some days are wonderful and my excitement is off the charts and others days its like the world is upside down. I know you were hesistant to do this video but I appreciated hearing someone say they have the same issues I do. Makes ya feel not so alone.
Thank you so much for sharing this video. It's really helpful to hear about others' experiences and how different people get through the difficult moments in life, however long they last. Big hugs from me and my cat!
Yes Simon, I feel the same way as you.  I like being alone alot but I do not feel lonely when I’m reading because “books are my friends”.  Totally agree.  Thanks for sharing!
It's been really helpful to watch this semi-cuppa and a catch up/ reminisce with you Simon.
I suffer regularly with depression manifesting in self doubt, paranoia and manic spending.  Events over the last 2 years makes it hard for me to feel people truly like me for who I am or will hurt or leave me.  Recent health issues mean that more than ever my hobbies root me to reality and for this it is reading and art journalling.  I started Youtube last year and have done some book buddy reads and chatted with some lovely people.  I am so pleased you felt comfortable enough to be so open about something so personal xx
Thanks for this video. I work from home, which a lot of people think is the dream, and it is a really lonely 😔 I miss out on socialising out of office hours because I have fibromyalgia which makes it hard to sit in a hard chair for a long time and I need my rest. Your videos really help me feel less lonely. I do worry it’s a bit sad that I feel I know you but it always cheers me up to see a new video from you no matter the topic... well I would draw the line at Simon goes hunting or something 😂 I’m currently reading it’s all in your head. A guide to getting your shit together by Rae Earl at the moment which I think is meant for a slightly younger audience than me (I’m 40) but nonetheless is a good book on different facets of mental health and where to go or what to do to help yourself. Anyway thanks for the videos xx
Brilliant video - thanks for sharing :)
Brilliant, Simon.  Thank you.
Thank you, Simon. <3 <3
I completely agree that everything is spectrums, and that we should be open about our experiences when it is safe to do so.  Thanks for sharing, Simon.
My parents died in my 30s and i wasnt. ready.  I dont think anyone really is.  It wasnt books that got me though it was my Dads records the swing of Goodman and the jaxz of Coltrane and Miles. I wish i had Grief is a thing with feathers back then.
Thanks for this video Simon, and sorry to hear about the difficult times you’ve been through. I can definitely say that your videos - and those of some other lovely book tubers - have helped me an awful lot during some low times, so thank you! Also, books themselves have helped me to escape, take my mind off things and have sometimes reminded me that there are other people out there who have felt the same things as me, and have put it much more eloquently than I ever could. That’s the reason ’A Line made by Walking’ is one of my favourite books of the year too. That and the beautiful writing.
米津さんの顔ってお世辞にもイケメンとは言えないはずなのになんか超絶カッコイイんだよね。\n俺もこんなかっこいい雰囲気を纏える人間になりたいな。
L like it this song
最初米津玄師と菅田将暉が元恋人同士なのかと思った……(^_^;)\n\n\nそんなことより本当最高！\nわけわからんくらい聴いてる(^.^)
米津さんと菅田くんとか\n二人とも最高なんやけど！！
2人ともブランコ違うとこに座ってんだよね。\n今はどうやっても会えない。あの頃に戻りたい、記憶は今のままでもう一度あの頃からやり直したいって思ったことみんな絶対一回はあるよね。
米津さんはもちろん好きだけど、菅田くんの歌い方も好きだなあ
このいい感じに変わっていく感覚好きです。僕以外の誰かにもそれが音楽の楽しみの一部であることに気づいてほしいなー
今時珍しい気がするなぁー\n何回か聞いた方がいい曲って
米津と菅田くんの歌声が好きだから、凄く嬉しかった。\n2番？で菅田くんがサビの時に結構感情込めて歌ってるのに、MVは口の動きが小声ってのが良かったな。
米津さんの曲聴くと やっぱ好きだなぁって思うけど、\n\nそれと同時に あ…しんどい…… って語彙力無くすんだなぁ\n\nこれ わかってくれる人いませんか…
クソみたいな広告ばっかだったけどこれに関しては最高。
すれちがうように君に会いたい\n\n\nこの歌詞が何気ないようだけど、\nとても深くて、メロディと一緒に胸に残ります
When Kamen Riders W change his job became singers.
うーん…米津さんの曲は米津さんが歌った方がいいかなぁ…って思った。アンチじゃないです、、批評です。批評。

最高なコラボご馳走様です！\n(個人的に「たけくらべ」の内容が入ってるように聞こえました←)
米津玄師のかすれるときのこえすこ
菅田くんが米津さんにちっとも負けてない。\nこの二人にはどんなストーリーがあったんだろうと考えながら何度も聴いている。
袖丈が覚束ない夏の終わり\n明け方の電車に揺られて思い出した\n懐かしいあの風景\nたくさんの遠回りを繰り返して\n同じような街並みがただただ通り過ぎた\n窓に僕が映ってる\n\n君は今もあの頃みたいにいるのだろうか\nひしゃげて曲がったあの自転車で走り回った\n馬鹿ばかしい綱渡り  膝に滲んだ血\n今はなんだかひどく虚しい\n\nどれだけ背丈が変わろうとも\n変わらない何かがありますように\nくだらない面影に励まされ\n今も歌う今も歌う今も歌う\n\n忙しなく街を走るタクシーに\nぼんやりと背負われたままくしゃみをした\n窓の外を眺める\n心からあの瞬間に\nもう一度出会えたらいいと強く思う\n忘れることはないんだ\n\n君は今もあの頃みたいにいるのだろうか\n靴を片方茂みに落として探し回った\n「何があろうときっと僕らはきっと上手くいく」と\n無邪気に笑えた  日々を憶えている\n\nどれだけ無様に傷つこうとも\n終わらない毎日に花束を\nくだらない面影を追いかけて\n今も歌う今も歌う今も歌う\n\n朝日が昇る前の欠けた月を\n君もどこかで見ているかな\n何故か訳もないのに胸が痛くて\n滲む顔  霞む色\n\n今更悲しいと叫ぶには\nあまりに全てが遅すぎたかな\nもう一度初めから歩けるなら\nすれ違うように君に会いたい\n\nどれだけ背丈が変わろうとも\n変わらない何かがありますように\nくだらない面影に励まされ\n今も歌う今も歌う今も歌う\n\n朝日が昇る前の欠けた月を\n君もどこかで見ているかな\n何もないと笑える朝日がきて\n始まりは青い色
本来俳優の菅田将暉とはあんまりコラボして欲しくないな〜っていう事思ってたけど\n歌上手いしMVの魅せ方が上手いと言うかなんというか\n兎に角米津さんの曲が更に良くなったなって思った\nこれからもこういうコラボ増えてほしいなぁ(  ´ω`  )
自分で気づかない内にはまっていた。米津さんの歌は毎回そう思う。
ブランコのとこで改めて思ったけど\n菅田将暉は細い、米津玄師はヒョロい\n※貶してないよ
この曲を聴くと小さい頃の思い出とか懐かしい思い出が鮮明に浮かんで気ます…
3:07←この映像どんな効果を狙っているのだろう…意味深\n\n最後、誰も乗っていない二つのブランコの揺れが揃うの好き。
低評価してる理由が思いつかないのは自分だけだろうか
あれ、えむくん？\n\n\n\n\n\n違くて、言いたいのは本当に声が好み過ぎて惚れます。
何故か訳もないのに胸が痛くての『胸が』のところ好き😍
この曲が米津さんっぽくないんじゃなくて\nviviとか他の米津さんの曲を初めて聞いたときの衝撃やら感動やらを\nこの曲で感じてるだけかもしれない\n\n米津さんっぽくない感じ\n他の曲を初めて聞いた時の感じ\nどっちも「新しい感覚」だしね\n\n何言ってんだろう((
かっこ良すぎて高評価押してないことに5周目の今まで気付いてなかった
曲もいいんだけど、煙草大丈夫なのかがすごく気になってた。
クリスマスの広島のライブが死ぬほど楽しみ\n米津さんの曲はどの曲聴いても泣ける\n本当に大好き
もう11万の高評価はやばい。。曲の良さ+菅田将暉くんファンが湧いてる…
音楽かっこよさトップクラスとかっこよさ芸能界トップの組み合わせたとかやべぇな、かっこよくてカッコイイわ目も耳も幸せじゃん
毎回米酢さんの再生回数が増えてると\nめっちゃ嬉しくなる！
初めて聞いてみて、あ、こんな曲なんだー、んーって思ってコメント欄見てたらサビで鳥肌たった、、\n\n米津さん好き(  ´͈ ᐜ `͈  )
胸が痛くてのがのかすれ方が最高。やばい(語録無視)
再生回数330万回の内50回は俺だ
この有名曲詰め合わせでボカロとか知らない人とかも聞くであろうアルバムに、砂の惑星を入れたのはすごい
聞いた瞬間泣きそうになった。
歌上手すぎる
菅田将暉さんめっちゃ歌上手い^p^
苏打您可真帅

I am 60 and watch you both
OMG YESSS! I'm so sick of every youtube channel being targeted to children and everything being censored and bleeped or not spoken about. I'm 20 years old and i struggle so hard to find people I relate to. and often even when I watch youtubers my own age, they still target their videos to children and do 'back to school crap and how to make friends etc. I was overcome with joy when louise did that big video about changing her channel and I think more people need to!!
Why wasn't Louise invited to the Janya wedding, tho?
The day Louise made the video announcing the change in her channel I hit subscribe so fast! I was so excited! Love when youtubers are genuine!
That ending was so hilarious with both of them getting the giggles. I kinda go with Jim about the change in content. I first started watching all the vloggers. But, I've only really stuck to those who have grown their content up. It fits better with me, and, it also means the style of the vids changes. It isn't the same thing over and over where you can tell the creator isn't really into it anymore. I've never felt like that on this channel.
I got divorced, met a man on tinder and got pregnant YES YES YES LOUISE I LOVE YOU
30s are the best so far.
Love it! The answers are so interesting!
Are his comments moderated? =\
I started watching YouTube when I was 16, and I’m now 23. I’d say I grew up with some of you.
Louise I honestly think your a great role model cause I'm 16 and you show people like me that life isn't all butterflies and sparkles and things happen and they might not all be ideal or what you have planned but that's just how it is and I really like that cause I'm definitely not perfect and I wouldn't idolise someone that is in my eyes I want someone like me. In my eyes someone that isn't perfect and that has relationship problems or that has mental health problems there perfect too me cause they are showing there real them and not hiding anything. Well that's my opinion anyways :-)
I completly agree with Louise about not deleting her pictures, my mom also died when I was a kid and I would have loved to have more pictures of her, good thing about social media, you may have very embarassing pictures but in the future either you or any other person would to anything to remember those moments
Enjoyed this video... you two are hilarious but insightful! Would love more of this...
Considering what kids are watching on TV now, I hardly think a little bit of swearing in a YouTube video is damaging! 😂
I love you two so much, for what it's worth - you're both good role models x
On the topic of changing your content, i actually find that i'm more likely to stay subscribed to a channel if there content grows up purely because i've grown up too :)
Okay, honestly, my favorite video of yours. Maybe ever? ❤️
I do RE at a catholic school and we are taught to believe that Genesis (Adam and Eve story) isn't actually true, and is just a metaphor for how powerful God is
I was not the one that lost it LOL
Awe!! You all are so great!! Her hair is so pretty!!
the music is too loud
I like to think of myself as a realistic christian Louise I don't think I've related to you more than when you were talking about religion.
it's like two work colleagues forced to work together
Jim gives me the fucking creeps he's like an overgrown 12 year old
I’m 20. Should I ask my mom if I can watch this? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObviously kidding.
Ahhh I want a friendship like Louise and Jims :)
I am not a Christian, but if you don't take the 6 days of creation literally and assume a 'day' means a different length of time, the story is actually in the same order of creation as evolution.
Love both of your channels, Louise more so since her content changed. I've just turned 27 and always felt too old to watch some but you two have always been my favourites regardless. As you've both grown, I have too. Watching the two of you together is hilarious!
I started watching Louise more after the end of an era. I loved her more whilst she was being herself- i could sense she wasn't truly being herself in videos before that. Love you Louise!!!
Hi everyone,\nThis you tuber is trying to raise $50,000 for 10 Cancer Patients. Please donate if you can, thanks so much: https://www.gofundme.com/luckielifestyle\nHis Youtube Channel is: Luckie Lifestyle
Three Men and a Little Lady! Fave film 😍
What does 'lowering the tone' mean? I'm in the dark here...
I love that the content changes because we can grow with you and watch the creator make the cc content they want to create. It feels more natural x
This video looked so awkward. Jim does not seem to be on the same page/feel comfortable throughout this entire video...
Jim, most Christians don't believe evolution and Christianity conflict...
Threw everyone I watch from Zoe all the way to Shane Dawson my mom has watched a least one video of ever YouTuber I watch. She has never complained about what they have been talking about especially how foul of a mouth Shane has. She realizes now they have all made me the person I am , she loves them all as well. She never once made me stop watching someone and it really helped our relationship and made it stronger with how much she trusted me. I just wish some parents would understand that , I'm not one myself...but it really helps the child trust me.
Aww I’ve missed these two together! 😁
Same thoughts re: evolution and Christianity.  Love Louise ❤️❤️
Irrelavant to the video but what lipstick does louise have on?
You look particularly handsome in this video Jim 😁
Was shookt when Louise said that Darcy was 6 years old!!! All I remember is itty bitty toddler Darcy 🙊
I THINK THAT the only reason why Loise wasnt invited to the wedding is bcos of Tanya...
Pretty woman? The film??
my name is Jim too HAHA
Oh😍 Jim you are so handsome!
i love the film louise was talking about Talladega nights : Ballad of Ricky Bobby <3
See, the two of you touching on religion has made me want to see a video purely talking about faith and religion. Especially as you have a degree on the same subject. Xx
I really enjoyed you talking to each other even more than answering the questions - especially the take on being a realistic Christian and mature content. Good stuff.
Dear louise, \n                             I think you are a great role model. You might of made some bad choices but you are still inspirational because you have managed to make a life out of your situations. You now have a beautiful daughter so keep bing louise\nXx
The vast majority of Christians believe in evolution. Religious truth and scientific truth have the same source and therefore cannot contradict each other.
Is the thing Louise said at the start monsters Inc. Xx love you guys
I'm 12 and I watched the lost condom video lol
On the science/Christian thing - my brother is a ‘scientist’ (degree in science and science nerd) and he’s a devout Christian - preaches a lot etc. I think it’s all about being open minded and tolerant of everything. \n\nGreat video guys :-) you’re awesome!
I totally forgot I added a question and just for the fun of it I watched this video, finding out you answered my question! How cool is that! Thank you lots and lots for the answer and for turning it into a conversation about porn, hahaha. Ohh and Jim, you pronounced my name best! It's difficult, I know. Just say it as you read it! Much love again, Sjarlie!
I'm glad your content has matured. I started watching you when I was 16 and I'm 20 now so I've been able to grow up with your content.
Science was originally designed to prove christianity. Just because it has gone on to prove the theory of evolution it doesn't and shouldn't effect a persons belief in any religion.
Jim 😂🙈😂 14:33 ahaja poor Louise \nmaybe subscribe. but if you don't want to don't omg
It’s so refreshing to see a Christian believe in something other than Adam and Eve, yet the way you explained it as thinking Adam and Eve is a metaphor is brilliant. It doesn’t belittle  the belief of Adam and Eve, but puts a reasonable sensible thought process to it.
You two are so funny together
Louise, I always thought you were younger than me, but we're the same age.
the movie is Angus thongs and perfect snogging
That end bit about subscribing to Louise made me laugh so hard.
omfg the background music is so distracting, its like fake laughter in tv shows pls stop
i don't think the adam and eve story was meant to be like a direct description haha. most ppl take the view that the seven day creation thing is a v brief description of millions/billions of years of evolution. and the adam and eve story is to serve a purpose of telling the story of original sin and it explains well why the world can be bad. most christians believe that a lot of the bible consists of stories/metaphors that tell us something abt God. my idea of science is that is doesn't contradict religion at all, science is the study of God's creation! ^*^
Im a Christian and I believe God created the Earth and everything in it, in all its sciency goodness. Im not the only one, theres tons of Christian scientists. Be open minded about it, you will be surprised by your own wrong misconceptions.
JIM What hairdryer do you use, do you use it everyday, what hair product/s do you use and do you style your hair everyday?
Eminem ripping Trump a new one isn't on the trending list, but this total garbage is......
the music was fucking annoying - clicked off
Honestly I cannot focus with the music in the background. Maybe it's just me but it drives me mad
I haven't watched Jim in years. I found the desperate to be a children's tv presenter vibe just too much.  Happy Louise has made a  reintroduction happen.
Music is too loud and beat-ey
HAHAH I want to hear Louise's story about losing the condom, anyone know which video that is??
Louise and Jim are the best combination, neither of you beat around the bush with what you're saying and I love it!
Jim, you definitely have the gift of gab (a great asset for you).When are you and Tyler doing another collaboration?
What was the movie was Louise talking about?
I am proud for  my family to watch Jims channel.  He is a sweetheart and  very real, not like the others who put on airs and  fake
When Louise and Jim were trying to call people my phone started ringing 😂
Would watch Jim and Tan in anything xxx such good videos!!!❤
this is the best video
Is it bad , im 14 and i watch louises videos X
The ad on this video was your book on audible lol xx
I get my book tomorrow!!! So excited!
Louise has lost a good bit of weight go her
Subscribed to Louise after this. :)\nI looked at her channel AGES ago after a collab with Zoe or someone and didn't much like it but I guess that must have been towards the end of the old era. I like her stuff more now. Glad to have had her brought to my awareness again.
Louise looks gorgeous! xx
Jim deserves more views.
I started my YouTube channel to get comfortable in front of a camera, I went to an acting school for tv and movies, and we were in front of cameras doing audition practice. So it was a way for me to get used to that. Now I love it!
Louise, my dad died when I was young. I think all the time about how in the future my kids will be able to watch my videos because I would have loved to have something like this of my dad. Im sorry about your mom, but I’m glad to know I’m not the only one who thinks about this
When Harry met sally!!
Love Talladega Nights.
:))) lol
It's Madagascar 3!
PART 2 !!!!!

Have you ever tried this adult dating site?

i'm not going to leave one of those mediocre comments saying 'oh i wish that they were all close like they were a few years ago' because the reality is, they've all found their path in life now. some, successful authors and others working in the fashion industry. ultimately, i'm so proud of all of them. they're all doing their thing, and are smashing it. well done 'old crew' of youtube <3
I am 10 years old and I watch both of them
3 men and a little lady! one of my fave films! x
oh god. right before my period, i get insanely emotional. i cried literally all day yesterday! i'm on the pill, but i just switched, since it has been messing with me insane level.
Hey Lucy, at the moment I’m confused about my period as my 9 year old niece is on it and so is my 27 year old sister.  I’m 12 and I haven’t started yet but  struggling to tell my mum I’m worried about it as I have anxiety and can feel really sick over simple things like asking a question, what should I do? Love you lots Xx
I'm currently on Pirmella 1/35 which is generic for Nortrel, and I'm pretty sure it has worsened my depression and made me more tired than I already am. I can't really tell if some of what I feel is a side effect of the pill, or if it's just recent events, because I've been on the pill for 4 months now, but I've also been going through a lot of stressful events since the week I started it. I'd love to hear about other people's experiences with it so that way I can get a feel for what is what here.
I´ve been on both estrogen and non-estrogen birth control pills and the main side effect that I could not tolerate with any pill was having to pee literally every 20 minutes. Sorry if it´s TMI but I was really wondering if anyone else has ever experienced that symptom! I did get headaches, weird moods and bloating as well but having to wake up every night at least 4,5 times to pee was making it impossible to get decent sleep and I ended up walking around like a zombie. I have no idea how all the different pills have affected my bladder so badly and when I mentioned it to the doctor she made me feel like I am some weird person and I am making it up. So yeah, I couldn´t put up with this anymore and I don´t think I will ever go back on the pill.
I was on the pill for four years. I had tried different ones and I had found one that I felt was the right one for me. But when I broke up with my boyfriend of the time, it made no sense to still be on it. So I stopped taking it. The change was madness. My body changed, I gained a lot of weight, my skin had an acne crisis (I had never been an acne-ridden teen back in the day, so I had no experience whatsoever) and I remembered what mood swings were like. However, I felt more alive than ever (my sex drive was high) and more like myself, so I persevered on not getting back to it. After more than a year, though, everything got stable, my skin went back to normal and I lost weight. my general mood, despite the swings, was higher and so was my energy. I think us women follow a cycle and that is perceived as something negative, whereas I think it should be embraced and owned. I figured, with perspective, that when I was on the pill I was more reasonable most of the time but I didn't feel as connected and engaged with reality as I do now. (I live in Barcelona and none of the pills' names mentioned ring a bell, so I haven't mentioned mine) Thank you so much for bringing the subject into debate, it's so good to have someone talk about it publicly. Love your vids! xx
Hi, Not sure if anyone has commented about this yet as there are a lot of comments but I'd like to ask some advice if anyone has any.\n\nSo I was on the usual combined pill for 4-5 years and I always had regular periods and if I ever missed a day I would immediately get my period. However, I recently found out that I was increasing my risk of stroke by using that pill and was immediately changed to the mini pill which immediately stopped my periods all together, I decided after 4 months of no period to stop taking it as it freaked me out a lot and I was very conscious that I was in a reasonably new relationship and the constant waiting for my period was causing anxiety so I've gone off the pill. Its been a month now though and no signs of my period have come back. I've read a lot about it online and a lot of people have said that it can take months and months for it to come back but I just wanted to hear from some other people on the topic? (My boyfriend and I used other forms of protection always at this time since stopping the pill, I've also had 3 pregnancy tests, two at home and one at the doctors because I'm so worried about it)
Lucy which is the ingredient in yasmin that should be prescribe as an acne treatment? To stop women taking accutane, i cant understand what you said 😞
LOVED this video - it's so important to talk about pill experiences! I've been on the pill since I was about 15 years old due to hurrendous pain which meant I wasn't able to do anything and on one occasion actually passed out. I started on Marvelon and it was a saving grace. Then when I moved to uni they told me they didn't have it so put me on Gederal 30/150. I tried that and started to have bad cramp again, not as intensely as before but still uncomfortable. They put me on another one (can't remember what it was called) and that caused migraines so they then put me on the POP. For 6 months I was bleeding unexpectedly and heavily. So I went back to the doctors and they instantly put me back on Gederal 30/150 because I said I would prefer to have a bit of pain over unexpected, heavy bleeding. I've been on that since April and all was well until three months ago three/four days before my period was due I began to have 'heart flutters' as though I was nervous about something. Then the day before my period I began to feel anxious and worried about everything, including being around customers at work. This has happened for three months consecutively now and the only thing I can put it down to is my pill.
Lucy! I made a video kind of talking about my expierence off the pill and mentioned you because this vlog completely turned my around mental health!!! Check it out if you wanna, I figure i'd put it out there (: \nXx
GO ON THE MIRENA COIL! It's the best!
I can't handle yeasts either - including vinegars, fermented foods & drinks, sugar, refined carbohydrates & mushrooms. It can be connected to candida. Best of luck finding your root cause & thanks for the pretty vids.
I was lucky that the first pill prescribed to me (gederel) worked well for me. I think I became way less emotionally stable, started bloating more and found my weight harder to control but I got a boyfriend and went to university at this time, so it’s hard to know whether this was actually the pill or just me changing as a person. I came off my pill about 3 weeks ago so we’ll see if anything changes with my emotions!
I never get mood swings during my period, but im not sure if thats because I run my pill packets together lol
I was in a similar boat to you, except Yasmin dried up my sex drive and gave me awful PMS. I’ve been on nuvaring for the last 3 years and it’s perfect. The hormones are released locally so a much lower dose. It’s made my mood great and I actually lost weight!
I was on microgynon and i felt horrible. I stopped hormonal contraception since 5 years, also went vegan and I have never felt better.
Does anyone have any post-coming-off-the-pill-acne advice? I've been off the pill for almost a year now and my skin just keeps getting worse and worse... I don't really want to get any medication because I know it's hormone-related so that wouldn´t really be effective. Also my hair has been getting SO greasy so quickly which is so annoying, I could literally wash it every 6 hours urgh any tips pleeeease
LUCY YOU STUNNER (also thank you for talking about the pill because youtubers like you, hannah and melanie are the only reason i know anything about sex/contraception/hormones because school teaches you nothing) xx
Also my rule I follow is to take what your doctor says with a pinch of salt. I know how wrong they can be lately. My mum almost died because of a doctor and she keeps letting them just fob her off.
I'm on the desogestrel contraceptive pill, which for me means that I don't have periods and it's completely fine and amazing! No mood swings and no physical annoyances. I've been on this for 6 years and haven't had a period since then. My doctor ensures me that this is completely fine and healthy. 10 out of 10, would recommend.
hey! my mom has celiac and she’s allergic to yeast just as much as gluten if not more, so you’re not alone
i’m so glad you decided to talk about contraceptives!! i was on the patch for a couple of months but it gave me a rash (yikes) so i went off that, and then in august i got an iud (mirena) and it’s the best/worst thing ever. my hormones haven’t regulated yet so i’ve been getting some of the worst cramps of my life, but my period is pretty much completely gone which was an issue because i have such a heavy blood flow. i’m hoping in another couple months my hormones will be a ok and i won’t have any more pain 👌
i feel like the luckiest girl in terms of periods , i get them about every 3 weeks and they are very light compared to the average from what i can see . the only side effects i get really are a few spots and being generally hungrier/a little more emotional . if i can give any advice to anyone who has horrible periods is excercise and balanced diets as that is something i practice as much as i can ! if i am eating worse and not taking care of myself my periods are noticeably heavier and my mood swings far more severe . \n(not in anyway saying that other periods are caused by a lack of excercise etc but this is just my experience ! 🦋)
I've had really irregular and extremely heavy periods with awful PMS ever since i started getting them. I thought they might even out as i got a bit older but i'm 18 now and went to see the doctor about them before i went to uni to ask if i could be put on a pill. Because I'm gay and not using the pill for contraceptive reasons as well she was really unwilling to give me anything hormonal and instead has put me on tranexamic acid to help with the bleeding. I'm yet to see if this helps but i think there's very little known about non-hormonal pills; if they work then i think they could be a great alternative for people like you who experience hormonal depression on some pills (at least if you don't need the pill for contraception).
Ive never gone on the pill, mostly because i have no abnormal or really bad symptoms (other than i have a pretty heave flow) .
I used to have pretty ridiculous mood swings and low points while menstruating, but since i've start the pill they've kind of evened out. I take Junel Fe and I haven't experienced ANY side effects aside from lighter flow! \nBefore I started the pill, I remember trying to cook an egg on the stove, the yolk proceeded to break while I was cooking it, and i fell to the floor a blubbering mess.
I struggled to take the pill daily so changed to the patch. There was next to no information on it and the doctors were clueless but I have had a good experience on it. My moods are pretty consistent and my PMS is no where near as bad as it was on the pill. Although you can see it in certain places I tend to wear it under my clothes. I would recommend it for someone who struggles to take pills daily as you change it weekly.
I'm allergic to concentrated yeast! It's a thing. Everything is fine except for marmite because of how concentrated it is. It broke me out in hives when I ate it for the first time.
Loved the video I find you so relaxing! I was hoping you could do a 'how cruel is my makeup bag' as you have a large following you can actually make a small difference even if it's just encouraging one person to stop using products tested on animals xx
I reacted so badly to microgynon , so i asked for yasmine and iv never looked back.  I love it and i feel so much more leveled out. This video was awesome thanks for ur honest pill journey story, i was getting really sick of youtubers banging on about how bad the pill is , theres been a huge amount of biased pill shaming , so this has been a welcomed breath of fresh air xxx
Thanks for talking about this topic. I, too, have had similar difficulties with the pill. I finally found the perfect one for me, but it's expensive, but I did find a coupon from the manufacturer that helps with the cost. I wish finding contraceptive wasn't so difficult.
For a while now I'm having a huge problem with PMS. Like  up to a week or so before my period, I start to feel really bad, emotionally. And by really bad, I'm talking suicidal. I do have depression and take anti-depressants for it, but I'm usually fine - unless it's getting close to my period. It's heartbreaking and really, really exhausting. So much so that I actually look forward to my period now because I start to feel better and more stable immediately. I'm not on any birth control, so I don't know if a pill could make this better...
There is quite a controversy growing about the pill in France lately. More and more women stop it because of side effects they don’t want to accept anymore. Consequently there is a controversy about gynecologists because they don’t listen properly to women, etc. I stopped my pill last March, after taking it for 11 years and I feel good. My libido is slowly coming back (which was the main side effect of the pill for me) and I feel less « upset and angry » all the time. I didn’t have any bad side effects. I like the fact that now my mood is way more fluctuant. I spent 10 years having a really « flat » and constant mood. Which could seem nice, but now that I actually experience emotions, I think I was like a robot in some way ^^
my contraception journey: at the age of 19 I went on the implant, I spent a year CONSTANTLY bleeding and I couldn't take it anymore. I then went to the doctors and for some reason (God knows why) the doctor decided to put me on the combination pill whilst I was still on the implant to see if it would stop the bleeding.\nAs someone who suffers with Epilepsy I have to be very careful with what medication I take because it can affect my epilepsy medication and my epilepsy in general. I started to suffer from Aura Migranes (basically if I was looking at anything my vision would flash from normal colour to all pink then all green - the only way I can describe it is like you have got pink and green christmas lights in front of your eyes and they are flashing so all you can see is the intensity of that colour). I went to see my epilepsy specialist and he got so angry at how the GP was so reckless with my condition. He told me to get the implant out and swap the combination pill to progesterone only as the progesterone doesn't affect my medication. so I did this then I spent the next year basically feeling numb, I had no feelings, it was completely flat like nothing mattered. I didn't enjoy anything, I didn't get passionate about anything, nothing affected me. Then I started experiencing pain and bleeding when having sex (obviously my immediate thought went to cervical cancer), so I went to see the doctor, had a smear then got sent to the hospital for a colposcopy. My smear came back normal but there was some abnormality but it was normal. I went to see my nurse (Ive had her for 17 years now) and she suggested coming off the pill altogether as my body might be rejecting all contraception as that can sometimes happen. I did that and the pain and bleeding stopped and it's taken a while but all my smears and colposcopys are coming back as normal. I am now 23, and even though Im relying solely on condoms (not the most effective contraception) I couldn't be happier. My advice to anyone having problems is keep going back, you will eventually get it sorted, don't suffer in silence.
I'm on rigevidon and I've have no problems with it at all. I have been on others in the past and have put weight on very quickly and struggled to shift it. But this hasn't happened with rigevidon and I have been on it for a couple of years
okay so i was in my health class and i was really annoyed and i had really bad cramps. So i like corrected my teacher when she said something wrong and she got really annoyed even though there were other people also making the comments. She then after class talks to me like why the 'fuck you actin' like that so then i'm just like i'm on my period. she then goes on about how periods don't change your mood and i almost slapped her or walked out but i just kinda had to sit there waiting to leave. it was actual hell.
I've never been sure if the awful feelings I had when I was 16/17 Was due to bad mental health, being on the pill, or being a relationship that was going down towards the end of it's run, or a mix of all three. What doesn't help is that after I broke up I decide to just give up taking it and started to feel better and was starting to finish exam stress SO WHO KNOWS MAN SO GLAD TO BE AT UNI WITH A COIL AND WITH A NEW PARTNER NOW
PMS is the worst. I'm currently trying to read up more on herbs to help normalize hormones as I've had some successes in the past (Rosemary Gladstar is a good resource for anyone curious).
What's the pill for ?
this video is so important. I went on the pill (sounds like jasmin from your description but I know it as estelle or brenda) and then roaccutane to deal with my cystic acne. once I finished the roaccutane, maybe a year later, mum suggested I go off the pill and doctor said why not so I did. within a few weeks I felt way more low than I normally do, and unfortunately that fed into my grades for the rest of semester (or was at least a factor). end of last year I went back on the same pill and felt more 'myself'. so weird that that's the case when i'm *on* medication though, and I agree with your dislike of having to depend on it.
I was in a similar situation as your friend where I completely lacked motivation. However I had a blood test done and found I was iron and vitamin D deficient so I'm taking supplements now. My mood has greatly improved thanks to it, so it's not necessarily due to the pill
Thank you for this video! Perfect timing because I have been having serious mood problems and I didn't know why. I did some research and found out it could be my pill... I'm changing brands soon and I really hope my mood will get BETTER! Love you and you look GORGEOUS!
i love this kind of video ! <3
hey thank you for making this video lucy ! it made me realise that i might be in a hormonal depression like you mentioned the pill caused for you, however i've been on depo provera / the injection for about 4 months now and my depression has been absolutely horrible. i got discharged from therapy earlier this year as i was feeling better about my depression but i had to go to back to therapy as i felt depressed again and it was also around the same time i started by birth control !!! so thank u :)
My doctor recommended me the Yasmin pill which I was on for about a year, and I found it cleared up my skin really nicely, however, I felt extremely hormonal and volatile in the off couple of days before my period. Because of this, I decided to go off of it and similarly, my skin became awful. It's taken me almost another year and a lot of skincare medication to get it back to the point of where it used to be, and I really wish someone had warned me about the consequences of going off of Yasmin.
for what it's worth, i know someone who is allergic to yeast! so it could be that haha
“my womanhood just exploded out of me” this sounds like a line from a bad pornographic novel
I've tried \nCopper iud (rejected)\nEstrogen projesten combo pills (had awful hesr attack like symptoms)\nProjesten only pills two different strengths (gave me same side effects combo pills did) \nNuvaring (again same side effects)\nMy partner and I would prefer not to use condoms so we are looking into surgical options as I am in a hetero relationship and don't want kids
Do you think your feeling of ‘craziness’ was because you had a break up, maybe you were dealing with that too?\nBut I 100% agree with the hormonal depression, I was on a pill once where I felt so low, I changed and it was so much better
I'm not sure if I just don't notice my period symptoms anymore or if they're just very mild. My periods are generally quite uneventful--I may be slightly more irritated a bit before, but nothing ever noteworthy. They typically only last three days and the only symptom I've ever noticed is some heavy cramping my first day.
Before you do 23andMe or anything of the sort I would highly recommend doing some research into the fact that they can sell your genetic data to third party companies etc!
I switched from the pill to the implant then finally to the copper coil/IUD and honestly having something hormone free has changed my life. No side affects at all apart from slightly heavier, more painful periods but generally better skin, mood, regular cycles etc. Copper coil all the way!
I'm on the pill which has helped with me getting depressed a week before the week during and the week after so basically i had one week of feeling like me and that sucked however i still have body dysmorphia and i get very emotional and everything is very sensitive which i hate and this period it was bad i hadn't seen my therapist for a week everything was building up and people were being right dick heads this week and what made things worse is that teachers at my school still don't know or even try to know about mental health issues and how to deal with someone having a panic attack non the less my period can do one :(
I'm also having an unusual series of periods. I still haven't got it, but I'm already bloated, I'm super hungry all the time, and I've been feeling depressed for a few weeks. And that's weird cause I never had mood changes before due to my period. I don't understand why this changed. Can your body just change like that even if you haven't done anything different in your lifestyle? As for the pill, I don't feel comfortable taking it, so I just don't :) To me it feels too artificial and I'm not a big fan of hormonal treatments (anyway, that's just what I do myself, of course, I think everyone should take their own decisions on that and that it's ok other people decide to take them).
I was recommended Yasminiq when I was 16 and still take it to this day. I took a pill break from october-november 2016 to february 2017 and I got the WORST CYSTIC ACNE. It just wouldn’t go away and I didn’t want to leave my house because it looked terrible and my face hurt.\nI know a girl in the UK whose doctor told her she should take breaks every three months? But my doctor said that I could just take my pill forever? I don’t know what to believe.
I've been recommended to double pack my pill by many doctors because of my horrendous period pains (endometrosis) never once been told its unsafe.
You'd be surprised by how many people are actually yeast intolerant instead of gluten. It also might be worth seeing if you're intolerant to Malt - as it's in beer, but only some breads and cereals. You could get an intolerance test done from a nutritionist outside of the NHS and it really helps! Saves time with all the trial and errors of eating certain foods each month! :)
Deep shades of lipstick look so good on you compared to just Dabbing on colour
I used to be on a combined pill that needed a 7 day break and it was horrible. The pain was unbearable (cramps) and I became depressed and also very angry. Kept lashing out at my family and then boyfriend. Changed over to the 30 day pill and I'll never look back. I don't have the same problems anymore, rarely any mood swings (my mood levelled out) and it helped calm me down and rarely any pain \nTrust your instincts on this stuff your body will tell you when it doesn't agree with something
I'm 23 and I've always had a really irregular period ever since I can remember. When it came, it wasn't too painful, it was ordinary length and everything, but there were months when it just didn't come. Once when I was maybe 16 or 17, there was an entire year when my period just disappeared, although I'm pretty sure that was due to the death of my brother which occured around that time. Now I finally did go to the doctor and I got a pill, I just started taking it, so I'm really hopeful that it will help me having regular, on-point periods again. If anything, it's really making me more focused and helps me feel a lot better, I've been down lately, but I've been much more balanced since taking it. Fingers crossed it'll work on the long run! :)
I feel like the pill is messing up my hormones or is it my mental health. I really don't know :/
I take Gedarel, as I was taken off Ridgevidon after my face broke out and I had lots of chest pain. It definitely cured the spots but the chest pain has got slightly better but hasn’t gone entirely. However, I’ve noticed that with this pill my mood is lower generally, and my libido/sex drive is non-existent which is very frustrating for my partner. I think I will be going back to the doctors soon to see what can be done.
I have been on Yasmin for 7 years without a break. I have no bad side effects and everything seems normal and manageable (3 day light periods, no pain, no acne, no bloating and minimal PMS). That said - I'm worried I could be hiding my true self! What if I came off the pill one day and no longer loved my husband?! Wondering if I should TRY another pill just to see... or, should I not kill a good thing?
Period day 3 still living just about
My implant is really messing with me, and I should go to the doctors, but I feel like male doctors don't really understand, which puts me off, annoying because my first implant was great
My brother has a yeast intolerance so it's very possible that you could be allergic to that. He also lives in London where yeast alternatives are a lot more available for things like yeast free soy sauce and suchlike :)
I can relate to so many of these pill problems. Taking the pill was just not the right thing for me. I used to get headaches that were out of this world, and it was every time during my pill break (so essentially my period) without fault. I knew that two days after going on a break I couldn't schedule anything with friends because I would be in bed with all the lights out and no sound whatsoever. Now since I am off the pill and using a non-hormonal way for birth control I am so much happier. I can't recommend it enough to try and go without hormonal birth-control for a while, it's so much better for your body and your mind (I used to be an emotional mess whilst on the pill, now I'm totally fine)!
See im on Microgynon and have been for over a year and it really agrees with me so far compared to the 3 others ive been on. But i really wanna come off and try the contraceptive app, but my partner doesnt like condoms. EH. LIFE OF A WOMAN.
every time i watch her videos i feel so peaceful inside <3
You do make me consider going to the doctors to try another pill... Even if its just to see what it would do to me Hahaha
I mean your aesthetic is just goals
The food thing may also be fermented foods? All GI doctors get you to do the FODMAP diet, I'm sure you've heard of it. Maybe talk to your doctor about giving that a go? Kombucha is also fermented fruits and stuff hence why I suggested the FODMAP diet. It helps narrow down which food group it is x
a book i read about nutrition told me to find out for myself what i'm intolerant to and how differents food affect my body (cutting stuff out, trying new foods, etc) it's a looong road but i'm willing to try it 🙌🏻
Also, I couldn't recommend enough picking up the book A Mind of your Own by Kelly Brogan. At least look her up on facebook or on her website
This video came at the right time! I have really heavy, really painful, super irregular period and I've been trying to research what kind of pill would help me. The thing is, my mom is against it. It's already been more than five years since my first period (it'll be six in April) and they've been getting progressively worse. This last period, I woke up twice at night because of the pain. And I was on a heating pad! I've been having to take two Aleve and an ibuprofen in the morning, then another ibuprofen at lunch or when I get home. I'm just tired of my super heavy periods and want some relief.
I'm having a very similar experience right now! I've been on rigevidon for about 8 months now, but starting in May, I began to have anxiety attacks about once every 2 weeks or so, normally in the evenings. Recently they've been happening way more often, and this period it's happened three days in a row. I know that rigevidon has caused similar anxiety symptoms in a lot of other women so I'm thinking of swapping to a lower oestrogen pill!
This was lovely to watch, especially as I'm on my period too! You're the only person I know of who has tried Cilest, it was the first pill I tried and I was on it for 3 years and the only reason I stopped was because it stopped effecting my periods and I just had irregular periods anytime instead of during my week break. I then went on Cerazette I think (mini pill) and I was on it for 2 weeks and it made me suicidal so I came off it and my GP was horrible about it but this was the same GP who didn't believe me when I came to her for help with anxiety and depression. I went on another combined pill for a while and then ended up back on Cilest and eventually on a cheaper version of it at the moment! I get awful PMS too I hate myself on my period. I get so forgetful, very irritable and impatient but also mega tired and I either want to eat everything or nothing. I can't believe some of the things doctors have said about the pill, taking two pills at once sounds mental! \nI take my pill 2 months at a time and then I have a week break because during the week break I get bad migraines and my mental health gets really bad so I try to avoid having a period every month and doctors have said it's okay to do it the way I'm doing it. I love watching videos about this stuff, I love talking about contraception and sexual health because it's a personal thing that I don't tend to discuss as most of my friends are on the implant and all tell me I should get it but no thank you 😂
I have a hormone imbalance. Probably have pcos due to most of the woman in my mums side having it. I started at 11. It was irregular, fairly light but very bad cramps. I have ibs so that interfered. After a year my period got heavier, began my descent into anxiety and depression, cramps got worse, acne EVERYWHERE other than my face lol. Gained an obscene amount of weight. I left my school and moved to a much better one. Two kinds of pills later I’m on sertraline and an anti acid with no pill. My periods are back and batter ish. I used to have them for 2weeks to 8weeks and now they’re exactly 7 days and only very very heavy for 2days. Zelest was great as it removed my periods completely but due to gaining weight I couldn’t take it. I went on the single hormone which really didn’t work. Bit babbly but you get the picture. Much happier now, still fighting my weight but I’ll get there. Ly girl - starting conversations from day one xxx
i read a historic book and suddenly started to cry...yeah hormons are great
I swear A LOT on my period and I'm so emotional
I love these type of videos.
I don’t understand why you put so much god damn emphasis??? on using cruelty free make up but you still but from shops like H&M? Like??? Why don’t you care about your clothes being cruelty free? I don’t... understand??
I’m on the pill Marvelon to help my skin and my period pain and my skin is incredible, I went from having acne to completely clear skin but my period pain is awful.. I accidentally doubled a pill this month when I was hungover (no idea why) and I’ve started my period early, usually I start on exactly the same day on my break week, but I am in agonyyyy, I need a pill that fixes my skin and my pain🤦🏼‍♀️ loved this video! X
I believe I have premenstrual dysphoric disorder. I also have really heavy, long and painful periods so that I cry from the pain and everything it is not a good time
I have REALLY bad cramps on my period, but I've just gone on the  rigevidon pill. I've just had my first period on the pill and I had NO CRAMPS!!!! I was the happiest person on the planet, so that's my story 😊
i’m on yasmin too!! i’ve been on a few different ones after suffering from intense cystic acne and yasmin with antibiotics has worked a treat but i’m so terrified of when i decide to come off it and get bombarded with it again!!
After 6 years on the pill, most recent being Desogestrel, I decided to come off it altogether. I feel liberated 👍👍 could not deal with the constant flat moods and not really giving a shit about anything - good or bad. Now I watch adverts and cry when i think theyre emotional looool SUCCESS
I've had the ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel pil since I was 14. As far as I know it's been working for the last 5 years.
About the food/diet thing, I'm suffering with IBS, which involves things such as bloating and feeling sick after eating. (Relatable to your symptoms)\nAt the moment I'm doing a diet called the Fodmap diet which is of course meant to help with the symptoms but the main goal is to find out what food triggers you by trying several categories of foods and keeping a diary. I've only started a couple of days ago, so I'm still very new at this but I thought of the diet immediately when you mentioned the foods that might or might not trigger you. It might not be useful for you at all but it is worth to google :)
I have never used a hormonal pill however I do take a herbal supplement which has been LIFE CHANGING! I used to get the most intense cramps, back and leg pain as well as severe nausea and fainting episodes, every month! I had tried anti nausea pills from the doctor but they weren't always effective and did nothing for my mood swings and menstrual cramps. I visited a homeopathic clinic and ended up starting on 'agnus castus', a herbal supplement which balances my hormones throughout the month. It basically stops the huge build up of hormones on the first day of my period which was causing my body to go a bit mental! This literally cured me and if I remember to take my supplements everyday I can have almost no symptoms whatsoever - even less painful symptoms like breast tenderness has almost diminished! I know it sounds hippie and alternative and unlikely to work, but I have found the natural way far more effective than anything I have ever been prescribed. Homeopathy treats the underlying condition whereas, in this case with my periods, conventional medicine was just trying to treat the symptoms. I am now in the position where the symptoms do not occur. The only down side is you do have to pay for it however my supplements are about £9 a bottle and I only use up about 3 per year so it's a small cost for the amazing benefits I receive. I really cannot recommend it enough!
Love ❤️ your videos!
you seem like helena bonham carter
Youre hair!' 😍
microgynon fked me up
Mmmm another GRWM? Feed me I need more Lucy
shit.
'Best' pill for hormonal acne?
It might be barley
girl theres gluten in beer
Why the fuck are feminists so obsessed with menstruation?
I used to get so irritated every time i had my period, this was pre birth control and literally anything done by anyone, especially by brother, would make me so frustrated. but now i'm on the implant and that fucked up my periods so i went on a pill at the same time to try and figure that out but now i'm off the pill and my fucked periods have come back. (fucked being that i would get a really long period every 2 weeks) so i think i'm just going to get the implant out, maybe go hormone free for a while who knows\nbut i am absolutely terrible at taking a pill at the same time every day so i'm going to need something i can't mess up\nAlso i think the implant it messing with my skin as well plus i'm not really have sex so theres sort of no use having it \naghh but idk
Party details in the description! Hope to see you there!\nAlso, the #MakeMusicEverywhere merch is only on sale for one more week! http://merch.andrewhuang.com
You are so right. I suck at finishing.
I don't know if you ever take music suggestions from the comments but you should make some tayste djent metal songs.
We need to give Andrew a Masterclass.
I'm gonna make a video where I finish all my unfinished projects, and finally break the unfinished projects curse I have!\nAnd not a single word was heard about that video ever again.
Thank you so much for this advice - you are a constant inspiration! :)
Hm, I would have thought it was don't compare yourself to others
The song is so damn good I at the showing tonight and it was amazing!!!!!!!!
YOU MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY I ALMOST DROPPED MY BASS 2:56
It is SO true! Every time I start a project I find myself struggling to just finish it. I find that I fall in love with my ideas and it's so hard to create them without them being perfect, but the truth is... There is no perfect, only finished. I always have to remind myself of that but it's so true.\n\nOh, water is true too. #820hydrate
May 2009 was a month before you finished the extended NEVER (also the same month you put out BIRD SONG)
What next I finished watching the video???
Of all times you host a meetup it's on my final exam :(
Damn I hate the new sound that plays when you upvote a comment
You are ridiculously productive.\nConsidering you put a music track and a video out in 3 days and considering the quality of the content this comes off as, well, insane.
I found this to be really inspiring, so thank you so much for making this video!\nAlso, I was just wondering: how do you distribute your music? And if you do it personally: which website do you use (and why)?
Once you see his eyebrows, you won’t be able to stop noticing them
That's true. I never finish anything!!
aw mannnn, I wish I could go to the 1 million subscriber party tomorrow because I'm like 3 hours away in Ontario but I don't drive and I have college :c
These are some great tips! I've just started out with this whole music production thing, and I would highly appreciate it if you guys could give me feedback on my music: https://soundcloud.com/user-886261717  Keep making amazing stuff!
Can someone tell me what time the party is
I like how the title looks like click bait, but it isn't

There is no perfect, there is only finished.\n    -Andrew Huang 2017\n\nWords to live by.
I have a great voice
May 6th! That's my birthday! :D 3:02
Why Andrew? Why?! Why did you not emulsify your vinaigrette?
I am Finnish, thus I am complete.
Hey Andrew, you should try and make a song using different sounds from Doctor Who, just thought it would be cool.
that last song is quite beautiful. i agree with what you said about finishing projects. even though every work can be made better, at some point you want to share it with people. so you must decide what is more important to you, perfecting it, or getting it out there. i believe the whole point of creating something is to share ideas & connect with others.
*@ANDREW HUANG*\nGet a large and well isolated thermos and your ice water will last for hours and you don't need to go to the kitchen to refill it ;)
Help, I'm too good at starting!\nAll I ever do is start. I don't think I've finished anything..
So very true! Remember not to get caught up in the 'perfection' and move on to the next project.

Hey Andrew, when will you finally visit Marti Fischer?
lmao i dont finish any of my art =(
Cannot love this video enough. I've been hearing this finish your shit message everywhere i look lately. Something tells me i should finish my shit
When you use the Push, how do you stay in key? Is it harder or easier than using a midi keyboard?
You hit one million
I didn't think I needed this but I did. Thank you.
Song challenge: play Foreigner's cold as ice with ice cubes
you should collab with Sharpe he makes beats too
Yessss - that was so GOOD brother, that last song had me in chills.
Honestly, thanks so much for saying this. I'm not a musician but i do 3d animation and models and stuff and a good majority of all the time i put into it result in unfinished projects that i'm not happy with and continue to put off saying i'll finish or fix it later but I never do.I'm glad you said something about it. Thanks
Finishing music is not easy to do
Is hard to see... 'cause it's glass.
There is no perfect, only finished. I'm taping this to my ceiling so I can stare at it when I go to bed and go to sleep.
Song Challenge: Elevator music. Make music with only the sounds from an elevator, either where you live or in a big city the next time you visit one. Bonus challenge: You can't make any of the sounds intentionally. Just ride an elevator a bunch of times recording all the sounds it makes, and the people inside. !!!
I mean I know you have 1+ mil subs but bro you deserve so many more
Did anyone actually win the million subs giveaway ? .. not me :( \n#ineverwinanything
That last song sounds so much like Coldplay I love it!!
it's hard to see because it's glass. i like this!
https://youtu.be/TkObLEgXnIU — that`s Andrew`s video from this february, that was recomended to me by youtube. Both this and that one are working both ways as prequel/sequel to each other being 9 mounths apart. Nice way to finish, keep it up.
i really like your setup! its so aesthetic
6:13 when it’ll get released?
This whole video is about the exact reason why I started my channel.
bro this video has a whole second sexual meaning
I just realized that I follow you because I envy you :l
This definitely isn't even restricted to art. It partially applies to the programming projects I do too, except finishing them takes more time.
Ive only realised this now after watching him for a year that has he ever had a voice drop?
How about a song like the intro to American Horror Story? Embrace the spooky season
And to find out what this one thing is, \n\nYou just have to buy my new book
Art is never finished, only abandoned.\n                                    Leonardo da Vinci
Thank-you for this video, Andrew. It's something I am trying to make myself understand as well as my friends too.  Keep up the inspirational videos!
Finishing is all about making decisions. And decisions are often hard.
Don't trust a perfect person, and don't trust a song that's flawless |-/
... You're everything i need XD Also, that last song was... So good.
The last track is the dreamest!!!
Like the Mona Lisa's eyebrows??????
Andrew can you make music with a midi fighterlike Shawn Wasabi?
I'm a new artist and I have like 25 different song ideas on my computer and not one of them is finished. It's just so hard!
Your tracks are really dope. Very unique
I wish I could have been there😭 all the best for your Friday the 13 celebration!!!!

So great see all of your hard work come together in what looks like an incredible collection Tanya, you should be so proud of yourself! I also appreciate the time and effort you go in to make sure your products have the right formulations, it makes such a difference to whether or not someone stays loyal to a brand, keep up the great work!
Which exact ones are the bottoms from topshop?
Just have to say how proud I am of YOU! Remembering the early days when you would model for Sam & Nic. What amazing things all three of you have done! That you're just as beautiful & sweet as ever is what keeps people supporting everything you do. Congrats, Tan!
I don’t comment very often, but I really wanted to say how much I respect your work ethic♥️😊.  Even when you’re clearly not feeling well, you get up, get dressed, do your makeup and get it done!!!  (And look lovely whilst doing it, I might add!). An true inspiration.  I hope that the young ladies watching realize that all you have, you’ve come by it honestly... through hard work and determination.  Well done you!💗💜💘💕

Hey I'm from New York and I would love love\nLove if your cosmetic line would be available in the US I'm so jealous of everyone who's able to get them! They look amazing. Love your vlogs so much congrats on your new line 💕
That was no dam full wolf, \nthat was a wolf dog a husky mix morons.\n\nThat poor animal obviously \nHe was lost.
Are they sure it wasn't a Husky?  It kinda looks like a dog not a wolf
Just drove your fucking car off and try not to lure it to you.
people have probably fed him before thats why he's running after cars he expects food
He most likely want to change their minds about global warming climate change. It’s a hoax he wanted to say.
The resson why he followd the car bc he wanted water bc the gery wolf is hungry and thisty
It's your dog right ? Pretty sick.
My snack is running away!
He's got your plate number, so it's not over..
It’s probably dead by now... just saying
That is not wild animal...\nIt is someones pat...
You must stop vehicle, I would.....
Such a great video, you have a great channel
That's a dog wanting those idiots to take it home with them ..
He just wants a ride  !
What if came there to ask for help cause offtenly many wild animals ask help to human by following
GOD HELP ME! I'm so tired of ppl being so overly sensitive when it comes to animals. Some of the same ppl that treat each other like crap😒
It's not a pet.you are food.
Did you ever get rid of him/her
It was probably a line wolf thinking it had a huge kill
Why didn't you let him catch the car to see what he would do?
More like you drove in front of the wolf...
That's so fucked.. Don't toy with the animal. To be honest that looks more like a dog to me than a wolf, but I'm no expert on wolfs so I'm probably wrong.
You should have stopped. Not like it's going to rip the doors off the car. It might have been someone's pet, and just wanted a ride.
Oh you idiots. Thats rowly. He is a very well known wild but friendly wolf. I remember the area in the video. Its in canada. Me an some friends heard of rowly an we went to find him an meet him. He is a super kool wolfie. An he loves deer jerky.
That wolf was tryna listen to Beyoncé on the radio
It may have been a pet. Please stop and check on it.
Wolf:  *There's a killer in the backseat! I repeat, there is a killer in the backseat!*\n\nAww, he's chasing us
Why would you not give him some food?
I would probably have thought that it was a lost dog and in a effort to help him I'd be immediately devoured.  😂
Idk o dont think thats a wild animal and if it isn't thats kinda fucked up if it's been left out there
Yep they just totally failed to help someone's lost pet.
Hes Hungry and someone has thrown food to him in the past from a car. Hes so hungry hes hoping for a handout.
That's not a wolf. Wolves have long legs.
That is not a wild wolf. A wild wolf will not get near people. That is a pet chasing his family. This is a screwed up video. I own a 95% Wolf Dog. He is my second wolf dog. I have had these animals for over 20 years and was raised in the country around wild wolves. I call total BS on this video!!! I hope this is not a pet being dumped. If the wolf dog was done this way to make a video then the owners should be ashamed of themselves. Also the wolf dog could have been hit by another car.
How did a Wolf get in a car?
Beautiful animal.. he was probably hungry and trying to score some handouts from you.  Lone wolves don't have an easy time out there.
lol they listening to 'say my name'
They should've stoped. He may have been asking for help.
Aww that's cute but scary at the same time...
Awe! He looks like he wanted to play!
Whoa! That is cool, but one question: why was the wolf chasing the car?
Why wouldn't you stop for it? It clearly wasn't hostile, and as long as you kept your doors shut you would have been safe!
😓 It didn't occur to you to stop the car, crack the window, and give a quick whistle or pucker to check the reaction of the animal? If it came up to you car willingly with a friendly approach, it may have been someone's lost pet. This looks like a Malamute, without a doubt. Way too road friendly and even the way it runs is slightly more domesticated than the run of a wild wolf.
Probably has rabies it's a wolf people come down cold be mixed with coyote
He looks so addorable, why dont you get off and pet him
I would have pulled over and pet him
That looks like a beautiful husky mix.  Must be lost.  I would have stopped to see if it came whimpering up to the window wagging it's tail like a lost dog before giving it that kind of chase, and on a desolate highway! How stupid. Could have caused a major accident
wtf is wrong with this family
Why are they not just driving off he could get hit by truck!
i think people have fed that before not the people making the video but someone who might have seen the wolf on the side of the road and thrown food out the window to him
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂that wolf almost got them😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Oh man....I'd have stopped and given him a ride. He acts like a tame wolf who's lost. I'd have him sleeping on my bed.
This is some Bull Sh**!! Those animals don't just follow you.
that wolf is sick of being in the wild. he wanted a home.
The Wolf wants a home 😢😭
That’s a Siberian Husky...Wolves are wayy bigger. Why would a wolf chase a car in the first place? That was someone’s pet for sure.
probably a pet you idiots. get out much?????
0:30 shows how smart they are and also I'm sure they wanted y'all to hop out and say hello and good bye sense you are just driving by there territory of I am correct and or they wanted a ride some were
Who seen the collar tag a 0:07 that's there dog and then listen to wat there are saying
Fuckers should of atleast threw some food out for making it run so far
That's a Husky, not a wolf.
he must have been fed by people in the past.  no other reason to keep following you .
Pissed on the floor one to many times.
I would let him in my car tbh..
That was crazy! Could have at least stopped and gave the poor dog water.....
Help the poor fella , he needs help
Can somebody take this video off of You tube.  This poor dog wanted these idiots to help him.  Take this video off.
That looks like my dog.
i hope this happens to me for some stupid reason....C:
This looks exactly like my sweet ranger who I got as a stray. It breaks me
If he's a dog where is his collar? Hope it wasn't a dog. 😢 i would hate to think it was lost
they dumped that dog. it was a mix wolf. it was chasing them down. it did not wabt to be lwft behind.
This is sad,he seems hungry.I would have thrown out my middle child.I wont part with my first born or the baby but the awkward middle one would make a good sacrifice.
Nice Husky:)
He smelled children
Reincarnated lost relative
Agree it must have been someone's pet! Unrealistic demeanor for wild animal.
dog
Wolfie!!! 😍😍😍😍
pagka tagaw! iro na uy! sabagay wala na sa Bohol.
Look like a husky
Aww
Wow
heart breaking
Bisdaka diay :)
Thats really sad
Bisaya di ay ka!lol
Poor dog
Oh My Goodness 😍🐺❤️
Such a majestic boy
So cute, wolves are awesome
Where this at
Mga bisaya
Fuckin asshole people
What the actual fuck i wrong with the comment section? Idiots saying the family should have gotten eaten for some mangy animal that's worth a dime a dozen? Who really cares whether or not it's a wolf or an abandoned pet? And how do any of you know the family fed it? Deers run out into traffic becaue their stupid, if you think a dog is any different for chasing a large, moving vehicle then you have problems. It's probably covered in fleas, stinks and would rip your throat out without giving it a second thought. For everyone saying the family with the child should have stopped and petted the random, dangerous animal, do everyone a favor and go do this yourself. People like you don't need to breed.
You and your family do have my sympathy for having to deal with all these crude, evil and generally stupid people in your comment section. Anyone expecting any of you to exit the vehicle and approach a wild, potentially dangerous animal is frankly just insane. I, unlike everyone else it seems, read the full description of the video and know that there was no service in your area at the time to calling the park service or anyone else for that matter to try and aid the _possibly_ lost animal. There was nothing you could have done save for just driving away quickly. True, I suppose you could have tried to get the attention of a passing driver for help but honestly, what could they have done either? Not many people would be willing to drop everything they are doing to assist strangers who are trying to assist a wolf/dog without knowing what its intentions really are. And believe me when I say *nobody* knows what this animal really wanted. There are a dozen reasons why it could look happy, wagging its tail and chasing your car. Even if you put it in your car what assurance would you have had that it would not simply attack?
Is that Bigfoot at 1:01 mark?
this is not a grey wolf this is someknes let dog bops!!! and she's desperately still looking for him
LOL @ all the idiots who think this is a husky. XD The snout is not short and stubby enough to be a husky, body is too long and slender and the gait is wrong for a husky. It's a wolf that has been fed by humans. Not all wolves are 7 feet long and weigh 200 pounds, especially where I live.
The commentating was painful to listen to.
TEKKERS TOWN!
On the bench, Theo Barker! Not Baker, Barker. :D
I t h o u g h t    T e k k e r z  to w n  w e r  e g o i n g   Win
For anybody saying they could NOT see Tekkers Towns defense then Liverpools defense doesnt exist.😂
Next year the legend is Theo Heiny
Hugh was seriously a let down
comment who u think got man of the match i go for w2s
I thought there would be more skills... oh well
6-1 are you mad mate
Hugh Whizzy is crap
Jezza , Garnier and Gerrard were probably the best here! Great play! But Good Luck Next Time
tekkers biggest mistake: having Gerrard on the team. they just put bad luck on themselves
If billy was playing they would have won
Good game lads...Robbie savage is sooo entertaining to watch, gotta love him. Best quote of the day regarding one of the keepers, he should be playing for Donald Trump coz he's a wall.   LOL
Who else remember the first ever Wembley cup😂😂😂😂
Why didn't Joe Waller play? Is he hurt too?
Weller didn't even play... Why did he take his top off?
steven gerrard says next year??? mate this is not liverpool chasing the premier league lol
If billy wingrove played earlier he would have knocked in at least 4
The commentators just hate each other don’t they 😂😂😂

Stupid idiots running jogging good for health your joints get ruined it was about money for future joint replacements biggest lie future arthritic pain is real. Young woman died recently had joint if 100 yr old she was only in 50s ran jogged all her life joints ruined she had to struggle get up daily or frozen
The start almost made me heave
When you full of shit so you make up some bull shit
I can't see the point in running unless there is something that will eat me chasing me.
My dad almost cut his leg of with a circular saw and now hes better he still drives, runs, loads cattle on to trucks, drives tractors and works 5am till 9pm so deal with it
there's one thing I saw is how Casey runs. As much i know you are not supposed to touch the ground with your heals. That bad amortisation may be the cause of your problems.
But lieutenant dan, you ain't got no legs
Tell that to the future
Casey is Paulie Shore's son.
Welp this was a waste of 8 minutes
Living that right now man. Different part of the body and a different sport but the conclusion sucks!
Gonna get to the fucking point? Jesus Christ dude spends 7 minutes just to say I can't run.
At least you can still stand.  I can't walk anymore cause I got shot in the back
I desire to know where that dude went with the bed.
I bet most people in the comments never had to forcibly give up one of their life passions before. Would like to see you all keep it together.
road biking is a healthy alternative. i trekked for a few years. made me  a stronger human.
Rub a bit of WD-40 on your knees and you''ll be good to go
My dads the same so :/
this was such a well told but horrible story! hope all is well Casey!
this is a story i never wanted to tell then dont :/
Casey, if you wanna run again, try Oom Yung Doe
Run the pain away
Hope your legs need to be removed after making me sit thru all that bullshit.\n Fucking twat waffle
I also had a knee injury,I was in a lot of pain, docs told me all sorts of scary stuff, but my knee pain was gone when I started riding a bike on the mountain tracks. Try that if you haven't already, and get well soon.
Brining camera into a MRI room is always a good idea.😂😂😂
Actual disabled people watching this must think you're a self absorbed asshole. Grow up, haven't you got kids ffs!!
Ew, I hate Casey Neistat more and more every time I see him
@caseyneistat I think you should read a book by Christopher McDougall Born to run
Wut ?
That boy needs milk
ugh who cares
Even you cant make running exciting
HAHAHA man fuck this dude
those shades are dirty lmao
U need a knee reco.  Bo fukin who.
I think casey likes running...
Run Forrest Run
Under prosecutor seventh grbftr mysterious mass obtain unlikely hard trait delicate
Lieutenant Dan!
Youtubers are sooo self absorbed. Who cares? 🙄
Sheesh
ITS hapen widh me to Ane i am 12
Fuck off
Biking won't work?
You say run
You should try cycling :)
One word: Bicycling
Running is stupid.
Hey Peter
Music is shit
Can somebody please tell me the name of the song that is being played towards the end of video
Is it sad I sit and have the biggest smile on my face every time carrie & Oliver have 'moments' 😩🙌🏽👌🏽❤️
You can just see how happy Oliver makes you - whether it's friendship or romantically is irrelevant, the point is it's wonderful to watch
I feel I'm too old to say this but Carrie I've watched these watch me Wednesday's since the start and to sit and watch your relationship with Oliver Develop over time has been magical. Yous are so good for eachother- whether that's friendship or dating that's none of our business
Oliver makes you smile ☺️
I came to your show last night in Woking! You were all insane. Your voice is incredible, I've fallen completely in love. Waited at stage door but didn't get to see you :( I saw Samantha and Scott though ☺️ love you guys! I aspire to be like you x
Anyone else really intrigued into what Oliver said when he said “the beers cold and BEEP”
I'm sure both Carrie and Oliver don't want to confirm whether they're dating or not until Addams is finished. They obviously don't want anything to ruin what they have at the moment ❤️
Hunnyyy you’re hairs getting so long it’s gorgeous!!
Ah you went to my local! Good old Sovs.
❤Great video 😁 Please check out our small YouTube channel and subscribe if you like the content ❤
can't wait to watch you in Singapore!\nhope i can see you as well! I dont remember Mediacorp Theatre having a stage dooor
Are you actively trying to grow your hair out again or is it because too busy to get a hair cut? Also, loved seeing the after hours!
I’m really going to miss the Carrie and Oliver show when Addams Family is over. You guys make me giggle. 💕
Hi Carrie! Just a quick question for you and your cast mates. My school is starting our own production of the Addams family and I was thinking if any of you had any advice for playing your characters or tips for making things more fun/enjoyable in these cooky and spooky roles. If you do, I'm sure we'd love to hear from you amazing actors! Thank you and have a lovely day <3
CRAZY FOR YOU I FREAKED OUT WHEN I HEARD IT my friend was just in the musical
It's so strange to me how stage door works for the west end. In almost any venue on broadway in New York,or on a tour,there's a barrier and the actor walks down the line and says hey to everybody.
So many media interviews will leave you PRESSED for time!
Watching you Scott and Oliver just makes me happy 😊 ❤️ xx
Carrie, did Oliver share the After Eights I gave him for you all on Thursday night at stage door? :D
UK stage doors are so chill I expected ear drum bursting screams but overall it was quite quiet
is carrie and oliver dating?
I'm sure you've already tried it but coconut oil is amazing at getting make up off. :)
Ooh are you going on tour to Singapore too? That's exciting! :D\nSo looking forward to seeing the show in Glasgow!
I have to say it's weird to watch you be at my home town! Also sovereigns is definitely one of the nicer pubs in woking! Watched the show on Tuesday so didn't see you at stage door
Sub for a return
You are so sweet at the stage door! A true inspiration. I would love to meet you one day!
I'm two subs away from 425 PLEASE help me reach it, I ONLY NEED 2 MORE SUBS!!\n\nCHEERS GUYS!
She's like our own little celebrity! Lol xoxo
My mum came up to Bristol last weekend to see the show with me on Sat evening, it was bloody amazing! Thank you so much to you and the rest of the cast for putting on an awesome show!! Big love <3
Omg I love the ending 😂❤
Hey I saw you tonight in Woking and you were absolutely insane. Keep doing what you’re doing because you and the rest of the cast were incredible xxxx
without sounding too much like regina george, I LOVE your jumper, where did you get it? (but seriously, the grey one, I love it).
Why are the running times announced after the show?
Carrie to get your makeup COMPLETELY off invest in come cotton pads and micellar water. Properly wet 2 cotton pads with the micellar water and use that to take all of your makeup off like a makeup wipe, works a treat!! Xx
I remember the video, where you cut your hair! It is like yesterday, but no! Your hair is long again o. O
I’ll forever love you Carrie. Please check your Insta inbox from athina_alice xxx
I JUST GOT BACK FROM YOUR SHOW IN WOKING CARRIE YOU WERE AMAZING ALSO PLEASE ASK FESTER IF HES OK AFTER HE BUMPED HIS HEAD ON THE DOOR FRAME BECAUSE IM PRETTY CERTAIN THAT WASNT PLANNED AND IM A CONCERNED FAN (real talk though you were all amazing and I absolutely loved it from start to finish, I wish you all the best!!!!)
I’ve officially made it! Finally in one of your videos Carrie! Glad you loved the necklace my friend made you! ❤️
Coming to watch saturday night (cause missed it in my hometown Southampton)  :-D so excited! Love watch me Wednesday
I love that, with everything you do during the day and doing a show in the evening, you still make time for The Bake Off!!
Carrie when you first started the Addams Family you said the producer wanted you to wear those cool spider earrings. Do you still wear them every show? Love youuuu xxx
I AM DOING THE ADAMS FAMILY THE MUSICAL FOR A HALLOWEEN SHOW!!! I am Pugsley so...I AM YOUR LITTLE BROTHER!!!!! Lol I love your videos. Keep up the good work.😃👍
Just curious why do you get the running times? I know during dress and tech the production for shows I've done would time the runs but I don't fully understand why other than knowing how long a show will be.
Carrie! Where'd you get the floral dress from the beginning of the vlog?
I have the same floral patterned H&M top as you! It's soooo nice! x
If you're looking for a nice place to go after a show, try Cellar Magneval, it's a really nice wine bar in Woking town centre 😊
I genuinely have no explanation for this, but I watched you so many years ago when I was around 16 and your videos and just your general vibe made me feel like you were my big sister. I'm 20 now, and I recently remembered your channel again and decided to see what was going on. And you still have this impression on me that just makes me feel like I know you. It's an awesome feeling. I don't have many friends, maybe 2-3 that regularly see me, but all I have to do is watch a video of yours and I don't feel alone anymore and my anxieties melt. \nThank you Carrie. <3
I want to know what Oliver said so badly x'D
With the mask on is it just me or does Oliver sound and look like John Barrowman x
Seeing the show in Woking was absolutely brilliant! Loved everybody's perfomance, Scott's a great Fester, Carrie's singing voice is marvellous, and I simply adore Cameron Blakeley's Gomez. \nxx
Glad you spotted the war of the worlds stuff in Woking :) x
So weird that you're in Woking. Also so annoying that I've just left home in Woking and come to Reading for Uni.
omg carrie I LOVE your shoes in the press bit (the high heeled boots) where did you get them? I've searching for some for ages!! Also love the video! :) <3 <3
oh wow i really wanna know what oliver said now . . .
how do you keep your skin so nice with all that makeup every day my goodness Carrie share your secrets PLEASE
I came to see you yesterday. You were AMAZING!!!!
Carry just looks particularly stunning in this video ❤️
Carrie are you growing your hair long again (i was just wandering)\nP.s you were in the first les mis show my mum wached
Ollie is just the most precious gem ❤❤ i adore you both
In all seriousness what are you and Oliver gonna do when addams is over 😔 yous still need to see eachother 😩🙏🏼
I'm going to be subscribing to anyone who likes this comment and subscribes to my channel! Comment when done (legit)
I saw the Addams family on Wednesday and met you at the stage door and gave you a letter from me and my friend and you were so lovely  xx
Ive got to say... Oliver's eyebrows are great. No joke
I saw the show this evening in Woking and it was so so so good! Well done to you, Oliver, Scott and the rest of the cast and crew on a wonderful wonderful show! It was so great to finally see it after watching these vlogs for the past few months! ❤️❤️❤️\nPs was waiting all day for a vlog and it was literally uploaded ten minutes before the show and had to wait til afterwards 🙄😂💕
upgrade to the butt love dance :'D
God, I love Oliver 😂😂
Hi Carrie may I suggest you try coconut oil as a make up remover? It removes ANYTHING from your face and it's from mother nature so it doesn't leave your skin burning and dry 😃
I absolutely love your shoes at 7:38 :)
Every time a new video is uploaded I actually have a little squeal because I ❤️ every single video!!!!! Hoping to see you at The Wolverhampton grand!!! Love ya,big sis!!!
There were so many American accents in this I'm dying :,D
Love Love Love a Watch Me, Wednesday video! <3
Er, Carrie, I think the fact that you couldn't even remember where you came from on the train might be a bit of a warning sign that you are over-working and exhausting yourself. I'm no expert obviously and maybe it was just a one time mistake, but you seem terribly busy so just... take care of yourself! You do NOT want to get burned-out!
you mentioned it was a stagedoor night, did you mean it was a night you asked to do it and it was cleared by security for it or do they have a schedule for you now?
you are my inspiration <3
Hey Carrie, I just got home from the 5:00 show and I'm soooooo impressed!! Although we didn't get to meet at stage door, I'm sending you a letter so look forward to it. Thank you for being so amazing!! :)
where is your grey jumper from?  :)
SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME!! I directed an amateur production of Crazy for You last year!! I may have had a little cry when your warm up came on..
this may or may not be my third time watching this...
Captain America or Captain Jack?
Your finishes of these vlogs are quite brilliant. :D
Omg this is so weird cause I live in Woking and I've performed on that stage!!❤️❤️
i wonder how we know which night is a stage door night
Excuse me but in the first clip of you talking and clipping your hair you look just... incredibly stunning. The subtle makeup, the hair, the lighting. Just had to point that out. Love u guys xx
I couldent explain the excitement on my face when i saw you posted a video 😁
I'm coming to see The Addams Family in the Kings Theatre in Glasgow on the 10th of October and I was wondering if that was a night you'd be at stage door? \nI'm so excited to see the show.\nI've been loving watching these videos so much!
When will the new cast be announced?🖤
I was supposed to be seeing the show tomorrow evening, but I've only just got over a nasty virus after two months so I can't make the journey to Woking and back on my own. I'm so disappointed, but luckily I've been able to claim my ticket money back!
I am desperate to see Addams again, but I'm a broke student! Ugh! It's. Just. So. GOOD!!
My god your hairs getting so long!! ❤️
I'm playing fester in my production, I'm a girl
I don't know how you deal with Oliver sometimes. Such a potty mouth!
but wheres pete
Wonderful 🤗😘
<3
What did Oli say?!
EYYYY THE ENTERTAINER 🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻
You have pretty curly hair
💜🖤💜🖤
I'm actually filming this on a Wednesday \nSHE'S SO METHOD
Carrie you need to use coconut oil! It will melt your makeup off. Just scoop up a bit and massage it on and the makeup comes all off! Plus it leaves your skin nice and moisturized and leaves a nice base for anything you put on after
Do man actually expect them to rap about the trap their whole life? Kmt just appreciate the talent these rap niggas just talk the same boring shit on every song, ratings for them for switching it up
Krept's model is boom for real

Wo Wo Wo, Who are the 2 models WOW
Baaaannggeeerrrr🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Dis is what I'm bumping in da whip..!!
Came here looking to listen to a decent song. All I saw was a$$. This video is all about a$$.
This is wavy like konan's waves
These two suck each other's cocks
YEAH BOI keeping it going with the soft tunes cant do hard bangerz anymore\n\nIts all a money ting now
❤Great video 😁 Please check out our small YouTube channel and subscribe if you like the content ❤
whats going on with all these soft singing songs there all shitty auto tune they cannot sing for shit!
This song is really good, I don't know why people are hating.
No one ain't gonna watch it it has to much editing
Like this tune! diversity is a nice ting!
Production is great. But these lyrics are shit
I Ain't even hating on their grind.. but this ain't krept and konan tbh... this is some sleepy song
Switched it up at always gotta be road for man to rate it
The fuck why is this trending
I miss their songs like too young etc idk that's just me thou
I like the beat and the girl's vocals but the rest is shit, sounds like lyrics you'd make up as a kid.
zante ....lived there for few yrs, gotta respect the vid cos its my second home but the tune is questionable
Sub to me for a return guys
This in the summer, ja'17 would've been a nostalgic song :(
Very nice song boys don't listen to the negativity,  being versatile is all important in this game as you realise. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Woman in the orange 😋😍🤤👌🏽
I don't know how i went from watching. A bronx tale to this..
Should of put this out at the start of summer would of been the biggest banger of the summer for sure
This track is going in! 🔥🔥 just sad summer time has gone. Still blasting this out tho 💯💯
Whether you like it or not, they're copying the current American sound. They got big by doing their own thing.
This is smooth and that brown skin ting is bad af
You are from Gypsy Hill not Jamaica you cunt.
At the start it sounded like johnny cash's hurt
jheeze he shouldnt of tried that dancehall voice! he doesnt suit it
If this music video gets loaddds or views like TS it’s all bc of the girls
Yaaaaaw krept ah go hard with the yard man flow 🇯🇲
i miss the old sbtv buss in her mouth, like a mouth full of children days
There's probably 95% young men in the comments complaining about the tune being shit.. this tune is 👌🏾 and defo for the women ! Something a little different isnt hurting nobody plus the women are 😍 chill nuh!
I'm surprised they used a dark skin girl, you know how they already feel about black girls. Trying to win back fans ay!!
well this is shit
ERM is that fucking bria myles ?!?!?!?!
Krepts part is so Wavy
#2 on trending
🙋 ❤ ☝\n🙌 ? ❤ ☝ 👍 👇 😂\n*IYKWIM*
DIS IS A FUCKING BANGER TBH THIS WHY PPL FROM LONDON FIND IT HARD TO REALLY MAKE IT IN THE MUSIC TING CAH THERE IS HELLA HATE FROM ARE OWN PPLS... if this tune was from American everyone would be saying it's a banger so why can't we just stop the hate n this is a fucking banger!!!! Big up these 2 niggas they done a lot for the Uk music industry
This is so dead i dont care what anyone says it's terrible .. People only like it because its krept n konan .. Anyways seems like they running out of ideas
2:16 thats how bitches look at you when they're about to ruin your life
anyone got a version without auto tune? that woud be jokes
its honestly cringe seeing people hate on man who release bangers on bangers, so what if they dont fuckin rap about hood shit, if ur complaining u must be 14 lool
Rappers can't sing so turn up autotune real loud and ruin a good beat...girls are hot though
Konan was on sum Justin beiber shit and krept was on sum j hus shit but still a banger
Bwhen you expect a banger but it's actually a wavy tune
I'd like a plain omelet, no potatoes, tomatoes instead, a cup of coffee and wheat toast
Can everyone stop talking in like sum roadman pussy in the comments pls
This reminded me of drake anyone else🤔.....
I was born in the wrong generation, I'm only twelve and I wish to be born in 1349 when the Black Death spread throughout Europe
Love it it’s straight fire🔥🔥🔥
These guys used to be so fucking good man, then they got signed...
i dont get how people dont see this exploding,  chatting shit in the comments because Krept & Konan are setting waves in more than just UK  rap
All the Mandem saying this tunes dead are white
Man like Krept doin real yard man on this one 😂
Summer is over 😂😂 but still a banger
This is the first song that I've heard by Krept & Konan and wow they are good.
wow just went down the comments, I can't believe the hate first off this is for the ladiesand on some mellow, grown shit...he paid homage to alkaline he said his name so that denounces the he's copying theory...everything doesn't have to be hard and litty...you fellas must don't have any FBW LOL
This is sick!!!! And for those that have not clocked.... two albums one for the Mandem one for the girldem 😀
dead ting we need the punchline tings only thing they good at bun this dead one direction style type of music real talk
this video was so calming to watch

Hi from russia)))
Early comment!!
AMAZING LOVELY AND REALLY COZY!💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘
I've been using the neutregena hydra boost moisturizer for the last year and I'm hooked. Almost done my 2nd jar (costco size). I have normal to dry skin and I find this actually plumps up and hydrates my skin. First ever moisturizer than actually made a difference for my skin! ☺️ Love it!
Awww Darcy is so cute 💖💖
Jesus when did you tube turn this crap on
get rid of the kittens
OMG now i want to have a six year old this made me so excited and happy and 😍
im 15 and am still the biggest cuddle ever i love it and my mum is too! xx
I'm 19 and I'm still super cuddly with my mum because we're very close so I wouldn't worry, Darcy could definitely hold on to that trait x
I'm almost 22 and I still live with my mom, we still cuddle every day so don't worry, she will probably do that when she's older \n\nYou look absolutely lovely Louise xx
The Jesus conker story made me howl with laughter!  I teach children Darcy's age and they are just FULL of random little comments like that!
PJ MAKS ARE ON OUR WAY INTO THE NIGHT TO SAVE THE DAY, this sound is in my head far too much
I was so confused as to why Darcy was so scared of swimming until I realised that she had only just started! Most kids in Australia are swimming from 6 months old haha. So pleased she loves it!
What a cute video!!
I love that! The greatest thing since WiFi!
Darcy is sooooo sweet, such a lovely little girl🌸 & when I was younger I always remember wanting the family pet to be mine😹🌸
honestly one of my main reasons for being alive anymore if watching lil darcy grow up happy. <3
Darcy is a big part of the reason why I started watching .... Hope to see more of her..... Until then I'll check once in awhile💕
My friend is 24 & she still gives her Mom a cuddle, or sits close together on the couch having tea & sharing stories or their day. So don't worry Louise some people never grow out of the cuddles.
I like Liam a million times more now after finding out he's a swimmer! I am too :) :)
Lol ha pj masks so true. Having sisters is so super special xx she sounds like such a loving girl xxx Jesus concur. 😂 I am sure he loved it. So funny.
The greatest thing since WIFI --- LOL! I laughed so hard, partly because I understand. I think my son is the greatest thing since WIFI too!
Would love to see you colab with emily norris
Awww, Darcy seems to be growing into a very sweet, intelligent little lady.  I don't have children, but I love hearing about Darcy.  It's lovely to see how proud you are of her.  Also Louise, you look amazing in this video! x
When is the video with Dan and Phil?
I have been watching your videos for so long, I feel like Darcy is my niece (I already have 4 nieces, so what's one more). Can't wait to see baby Pentland as well.
When i was 6 i was the exact same
What's a concur?
this conker is for you... i've named it jesus. honestly relatable
It's so funny hearing about Darcy learning to swim (which is awesome go her!!) because here in Australia it seems like kids can swim before they can walk! We start swimming lessons when we are only months old. I didn't realise how early that is until you mentioned darcy's swimming lessons!
AHHHH please dont talk about darcy going 7 i feel so old omg
You look so lovely here louise. Healthy and glowy and beautiful ❤️
'and ive called him jesus' ahaha laughed out loud at that
Omg I remember when Darcy was so little, and you guys did a Q and A. Somebody asked if Darcy loved one direction and she just says 'raisins' and I replayed that so many times it was so funny!
My son has recently discovered PJ Masks... it has taken over everything! He has decided I have to be Owlette for Halloween!
Loved this video, not having kids of my own (yet?) it's very interesting and makes me feel all warm and fuzzy. Please keep them coming xx
I'm 20 and I still cuddle my mum every day when I'm back home - sign of good parenting I think!
I absolutely love that Darcy wants stickers of squirrels on her car. Definitely the next big trend.
Darcy is such a precious soul and we all love her but not as much as a mother's love Louise you are the greatest mother on YouTube
My sister negotiates as well 😂😂 she's crazy but it's kind of funny 😂😂
I LOVED darcy's car idea 😂😂 Squirrel stickers hahaha. Crazy child xx
I love the way you just enjoy her.  Parents get so caught up in everyday life they neglect this wonderful part of parenthood.  Just enjoying your children for the\n little humans they are.
Louise, our six year olds sound identical. There is now a little sister in our world too and my daughter is besotted with her - I'm sure Darcy will be the same. Love from Galway, Ireland x
You never grow out of hugging your parents. I hug my parents hello and goodbye every time I see them (I've left home) and it's always been a part of my life. I feel that most people who are not huggy just weren't hugged enough as children. It's a reciprocal thing I reckon
May the world be hers 💕💕💕
My younger brother is 6 and 1/2 too
I’m 18 and me and my mum still cuddle everyday! It’s one of those things that just makes you warm and happy! Lovely to hear about darcy and how she’s doing! Xxx
I cannot believe how old she is!
I'm a nanny and my youngest charge is the same age as Darcy (started year 2 this year, she turns 7 in November). I know how you feel with the negotiating, especially at dinner times when trying to get her to eat more veg. I constantly get cuddles and I love you's which makes my heart melt everytime, and seeing as I now only get them very rarely from her sister (who's 8, nearly 9) I truly do  treasure them 😊
Don't have a 6 year old... not planning on having a child... but I still love watching all of Louise's motherhood videos ahahah Xx
Hi random person scrolling through the comments like if you read this.
There's nothing lovelier than a proud mummy xx
My sister is 7 years older than me and although we didn't play together as she got older we've never really argued and now we're both adults were best friends! Argh  Darcy is going to be such a lovely sister!!
This was such a sweet and happy video <3
I remember my brother when he was about Dracys age did the same thing with swimming. He just went from being terrified and going nowhere near the deep end to one day just jumping off into the deep end and trying his best to swim the length of the pool on his own. He'd swim over to the side for support sometimes but he just got really confident really quick. It completely baffled me!
Was I the only one hearing thumbs up, unsubscribe? I was like heck no i'm still subscribed 😅
my son is 5. He hates hair washes and the shower. \nHe also negotiates a lot like Darcy 😂\nhe also has a sister who is 13 months and im pregnant with baby number 3. He was so excited through my last pregnancy and the first few weeks were a bit rocky for him as he also started school at the same time so it was confusing. But once he got use to her he loved her to bits and now he adores her and is an amazing big brother. He can't wait for his new baby sibling too. kids are amazing xx
Louise you are #8 on trending!!💗
can you do a video on how you introduced darcey to liam?
6 and a half?! Already?? Wow, I remember watching you before she was even born. Doesn't seem that long ago at all. I think you've made a very wise choice to just let her do her own thing without a camera on her all the time. 🙂
Darcy and my daughter Lara are almost the same age! 💞
she named it Jesus that cracked me up haha <3
YES NEXT WEEK IS THE COLLAB WITH DAN AND PHIL I'M SO EXCITED
When I was 2 and my baby sister was born I tried to give her away to the midwive 😂😂 Love darcy and the video btw!! She grows up so fast 😭
I love the 3 seater black squirrel car!!!!! Xxx
Here's s conquer I named it Jesus !!! Awwwwww that's sooo cute 💗💗😂 xxx
I think its great that you are Madame president.. Im 21 and my mother (Grown up as an only child with a single mum) have always been with on school activities and such. Although I didnt always love the fact that she was with on school trips and everything, looking back I think its quite nice, and I really appreciate that she did that :) Darcy is lucky to have such a loving mum!
My mum said that when I was around 6 I went through the constant I love you's and cuddles, I went through it until I was around 8 so you have a while yet but I've always been one to show affection!
Such a lovely idea for a video! Makes me want to give my own mum a big cuddle!
My sister and I are still super affectionate at 16 and 18 so don't think you need to worry about that for a while yet
This video made me so happy 🙈 So lovely to see how loving your relationship with Darcy is 💕
my little sister was just like this when she was 6, so lovely, love you both 💓
i thought when u were pregnant ur not meant to have cats around. its quite dangerous apparantly.
Aw! Im sure Darcy will be an amazing big sister, and im sure that you'll be a great mum to two girls! A late congratulations Louise, and Good Luck! Xx
That conker story made my day! Haha
She seems so cute and fun from what you say. Sending you and your fam loads of love and positivity.
I feel like I'll always be a hardcore protector of Darcy, and I've literally never met her. I'm just so happy that she's such a lovely little girl, who deserves the best - and I'm fully prepared to try and make sure she stays that way in any way I can! It sounds insane, but she's just so lovely 😊💖
I too have a 6 year old little girl and can relate to a lot of this. My little one loves setting up cafes and schools as well sounds like they would get ok fab! 🙂
I laughed so hard at the conker being called Jesus that I snorted
Darcy is such a sweet girl! My brother was so jealous when I came around lol he literally hated me 😂 but now we're 17 and 20 and he loves his little sister unconditionally! We had some pretty nasty fights growing up but it definitely got better as we got older. When he moved out aged 17, our relationship got even better and we sure loved eachother eventually! I love having a big brother, I wouldn't change if you gave me a million Dollar! And I bet for Baby Pentland it's going to be the same.
Loved this video, Madam President😂🙈 Can't believe how fast Darcy is growing up, she is going to be an amazing big sister!💗💜👶🏼👧🏼
Darcy isn't six. She's still two years old 🙈😭💓
I'm so happy you let darcy lead a normal life, I'm 11, and I think you would be a amazing mum! 💖
Exciting Collab! I bet it's Dan and phil
Darcy literally is me when I was a child 😂😘😊💗
What happened to Zulu?
Louise you are glowing!!
I miss darcy 😕❤️

This isn't even comedy\nThis is the entire video:\n-Hold the door\n-*He holds the door*\n-Repeat
I’ve done this and none of them said thank you 😑
DUDE YOU ARE NOT FUNNY AT ALL STOP!
One time, I opened a door for an elderly lady ... only to realize that 20 more elderly citizens were right behind her exiting a shuttle. Instant regret 😩😂
Happens to me almost daily except I don't get a thank you after.
Lele at the end 😂
Bruh why is it that the funniness of the video totally left when Lele showed up. Like come on man, you're not funny at all
This is shit content
Wow this is just garbage why do people watch this
I honestly I thought this was going to be related to hodor
Wow what a dragged out skit
Just put a rock
I'll be honest the whole time I was getting really annoyed lol.
I almost never hold the door and if someone tells me to I pretend I didn't hear him and walk away
This is the most stupidest video on the internet. I’m unsubscribing
OMG! When I saw the title of this, I thought it had something to do with Game of Thrones and Hodor. LOL.
Is it just me or did his girlfriend do get here right now or we're done twice in the same voice?
This happens to 4 out of 100 Americans a day . Please donate to help

Hey guys, remember when College Humor was actually funny? I know, I almost forgot they were too
I now want to buy a work out machine, and never use it...
You should do an it themed skit but for adults and it represents what adults are afraid of and it's commitment being sober and debt
I'm too embarresed to try new machines at the gym so I just do treadmill and leave
I just don't know how I lived without this. :)
This channel is going to shit
This is so true
Thought this was a new idubbbz video from the thumbnail :'(
It's the first time that thhe writer didn't do the outro!!! What happened?!?! :OO
Lol! I'm bigger than that guy and I'm 15 years old.
This was too real to be funny
I love seeing you with your shirt off.\nOf course I'm being sarcastic and your naked body makes me throw up !\nLater I'm going to drink, in hopes, I will forget that revolting image, but if that doesn't work, I'm just going to keep stabbing my brain \nuntil I do.\n☺
This video helped me find an excuse to stop working out at the gym 😉
You're saying you *don't* use them as sex toys?
*Hi guys, I want to meet ❣️ Visit my channel 💋*
He put the lightbulb in, while there was still electricity coursing threw it.
Why is this not a marketing campaign already?
It would have been just as funny without the profanity.
Makes me want to buy one just for all those purposes
Grant just wanted to be shirtless
this needs to be a real  commercial
Who ever did the voice kinda sounds like John Cena
Finally. College humor made a good video
So where could I get this from again?
is it just me or has Pat becum more hawt over the years
Hi I'm Roge ... oh wait, you stole his video
Fighter Workout Tip: End of the day you only NEED two things. Nice set of reasonable weight dumb bells (10 for newer folks, 20-25 goal. Higher if bigger person) and a really durable heavy bag. That and some god damn discipline is all you need to not only get your body in order, but do so in a way that gives you a very natural build. Nothing overly stressful, very little chance of injury unless you're a fucking imbecile, and exceptionally relaxing afterwards. I'm telling you, NOTHING like just going apeshit on a heavybag to make a shitty day a bit better. Put in what you want to get out. 5-10 minutes a day, or a few hours. You got that shit either way.
Intruding into a No Flex zone?\n\nThey knooooow better. They knooooow better.
This is so accurate it's making me rethink my life
i watched this to help motivate me to workout and by the end i am eating chips on the couch.
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!
Damn, I didn't know College Humor was still around.  They've been around for years. I forgot about them.
Where do I sign
I hate the no flex now all my close are ripped
That's a shitty apartment?
Can I actually buy that, I'll pay it off
Now this is why i sub to collegehumor.
Mine is good at gathering dust.
This makes me sad/mad
I tried to scroll up at the end... He got me
Why did I think it was try guy Keith in the thumbnail
On the bright side though, at least you will already have the machine for when the inevitable heart attack or CAD discovery happens followed by stenting or bypass surgery. The fear of death will certainly motivate you to use it religiously after that, in addition to eating better of course.
Boo! I only tune in to these to see Katie. We wanna see Katie!... Naked... Now...
Come on! We need iPhone X parody!
Anybody else notice the person in the window at the end?
You guys are doing better sketches lately. It makes me happy!
I HOPE EVERYONE REALIZES THIS IS AN AD FOR BOFLEX! you're retarded if you think it isnt. This is how snl makes all their money too, it's lame
ok i understand this vid whas for comedy but does this thing really work? cuz gym is so expensive and you can just have this thing at home
Fun video, but how about showing a little maturity, and stop trivializing the benefits of physical fitness for a change America?
The exercise clothes as pajamas was soo real lmfao
The dumbbells I bought can't do this awesome shit. Yeah my muscles are growing, but that's not the fucking point.
I hate working out...you know me so well, collegehumor
Only watch grant shit now, rest of videos have gotteb meh
Didnt pat used to be ripped? I have a vague memory of him having abs or some shiett
I have a bow flex with a ton of clothes on it in my garage right now lol
I have never met a person that went to buy that and didnt use it.
Lol I got a workout ad on this
Who else is going through the comments while watching the video
I didn't want to watch this video i just had nothing else to watch
Yep, this was a good one... \nWait, where's the All Seeing Eye?
just came here to see grant working out tbh
That's pretty much what happened with our exercise bike.
I phone x parody please and also a I phone 8
Is this a real exercising equipment? I'm actually interested in buying this
LOL That's awesome. I love the ending, fitness clothes you can wear as pj's. So true!
Are you lactating?  What's up with your nipples dude?!
I use a jumprope. I literally can't stand still since I'm thinking 24\7 so I jump. Also I subbed.
this is copycat from India, Pakistan or south Asian,old  common comedy.
where is the asian diversity on youtube. why does YouTube only promote certain ppl??? why????????? come on youtube you can do way way better.
This is actually pretty cool

The japanese guy it's Alex Yu from Prey. COINCIDENCE? I THINK NOT!
Does she finally get her fucking tits out, or is she just going with the same old I'm constipated look shit.
Should be interesting.  But I doubt very much it will fit the tone of Roadside Picnic, let alone the Stalker series.  Not outside of There's a crazy zone and wacky metaphysics happens!\n\nRoadside picnic style, you've got non military stalkers making a buck off the insanity of a cruel but (mostly) manageable zone, as everything slowly spirals out of control between looking for deeper answers to the underlying mystery they may never know.\n\nYou don't dramatically exclaim My husband was sent on a suicide mission! and then just walk into spooky science land without so much as a gas mask.\n\nThis is NOT LOL gonna suck!. But anybody hoping for a Roadside Picnic fix is gonna need to keep looking. They will just fine a good but unrelated sci-fi movie. With more emphasis on the 2 spooky for the human mind phenomenon, than the horrors of the unknown just being your dangerous day job until you ask yourself was it worth it?
Trailer before trailer is for ads so people don't skip after 5 seconds
Is it Carbon based?\n\nNo BITCH! Break out the shampoo, we pouring Selenium all up over these motherfuckers!

I have absolutely no idea what's going on from this...
It has a STALKER Shadow of Chernobyl wibe I like it.
Looks good! I rather enjoyed Arrival. Which was a otherworldly sci fi. And Ex Machina was really good. \nSo, the movie obviously has a twist/obligatory ending.\nJust don't come out during Black Panther. I'll watch both but average moviegoers might not
Maybe it's because I don't know anything about the book, but this is one of the most compelling things I've seen for a long time.  Love the otherworldly and intimidating vibe. Like Solaris on steroids.
Very reminiscent of the movies by Oats studio!
This may be similar to the part of the Dark Continent (HxH) where Brion the plant weapon lives
Looks cool, but I'm going to assume the plot simplifies out pretty fast. Alien force turning us all into Gaia. That's my guess.
NOW THAT'S A TRAILER!!
Wow! i can not wait.
im disappointed, i thought it was guna be morta; kombat
Just finished re-watching Ex Machina and went on YouTube to find this
is that the woman from atypical
2017 finally has its own ARRIVAL.
So, what kills us in this one, the plants?
If Avatar and Arrival had a baby......
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
A Prequel to The Last Of Us?
Holy shit this looks like it could be good..
Great trailer. Don't let some dipshit money manager Hollywood suit fuck this up for the real artists.
This looks like something that would be better as a miniseries. Just by the sheer scale of the production and everything they tried to pack into the trailer, I'm afraid the final product won't be able to pull together all of the spectacle into a real story.
PLEASE STOP WITH THE MINICLIPS BEFORE THE TRAILER!!!!!!!!!! ITS INFURIATING!!!!!!!!!!!
Wait! This unknown and perhaps unknowable life form which may not be carbon based is something you stalk with a WWII type carbine?
I already know the whole plot. Interdimensional SJWs are taking over the whole planet.
The name is going to be a fun one to say..... not.
They better not give them the gift of language or something stupid.
Got about halfway through the book and stopped; the writer didn't know how to resolve a story. It is compelling and even fascinating but the ending is kind of bleh. And the sequels suffer the same issue apparently. Hopefully they modified the plot accordingly for this adaptation.

Alex Garland has a beautiful vision
Looks good! I heard the books were really good and different from Arrival (which I loved), but I'm excited!
Is it me or does the music sound like it's from resident evil 4, when the regenerators come for you?
Jane! Here you are!
Devastating Victory: Laymen Beats Top Law Firm Here's the Story and Court Documents https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2L3_4gFIfU&t=679s
This looks amazing and it's Alex Garland so I want to say it'll be great but reading the Wiki for the book I dunno if this one's for me.
What’s the song?
This trailer lacks any of the original mystery or isolation of the book. Shame, I was hoping for something more tangible.
I like the plot of this movie :D
more alien propaganda huh!! either is is for real and they know its coming or its all horseshit and they plan to do a man made staged event!!
Now that I've seen the trailer I have no idea what this movie is about, and I LIKE it that way.
It's clear that Portman is well past her bloom so soon.
Ummmmm skip till Netflix
Awe hell no
CERN
I'm in.

Was it carbon based?\n\nWho the fuck do you think I am? MACGYVER???!!!
I don't know anything about the book, but this trailer looks amazing. 😃
This is semi like arrival
i get the vibe of watching stranger things
Please tell me she gets annihilated.  I'd buy that for a dollar!
Damn Inception sound is in every trailer now a days!!
literally finished the book the day before the trailer dropped and they nailed the aesthetic and casting so hard i am shooketh to my CORE
Wow seems to be very much like Stranger Things...
Can we make a hollywood movie without being naked...?

Ok that Asian guy needs to play alex yu in a prey movie adaption
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  \n\nFor with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  \n\nFor the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.  \n\nFor there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.  \n\nFor whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\nRomans 10:9‭-‬13 KJV
We're supposed to believe Tom Cruise (5'7 / 148lb) and Scarlett Johansson (5'3 / 125lb) are badasses, why not Natalie Portman (5'3 / 118lb).  Ever seen the size Special Forces or a SEAL?  Those boys 'aint small.

So much CGI makes me vomit !
Hey fuckers check out my soundcloud https://soundcloud.com/nick-nj-632183239/brutus
Natalie Portman is beautiful but she is the worst actress of ALL TIME. Please stop putting her in movies. She ruins everything!
What's the deal with movies having the protagonist(s) go into areas that haven't been explored and/or could easily be dangerous to their health without ANY kind of hazmat suit?
Since the next two parts of the trilogy, Authority and Acceptance, aren't in production there's no point in watching this.  The movie ending will be unsatisfying, tainting the box office, and killing the remainder of the story. Very similar to many other trilogies that never made it past the first part.

Women's washroom= Therapy, selfie session,etc\nMen's washroom= War zone, where a battle is constantly fought over who gets the side urinals. In under no conditions, will you use a urinal next to someone else

So Jay-Z's one line is I remember wtf is he, Pepperidge farms? lmao
Damn, Jay Z so quiet! He got 99 problems, but Ryan Gosling ain't one!
I hope they continue to rip Trump the racist piece of shit! And of course his nazi supporters 😁
Ryan ??? Snl ???? Oscars award ceremony  sketch its on the road !!!!!
Why does it feel like it’s been gone for so long
Jay z looks like he wants to die
Jay Z looks so old
The chemistry between these two! Its just not there one bit lmao
I don't think he remembers.
trump jokes are too funny I hope he gets 2nd term
Well I read from left to right black man on left white man on right think about it.(keep hope alive)
Everyone always swoon over Ryan Gosling and when I see his face all I want to do is punch him. He looks constipated
Yassss! I'm here for it. I love Jay! 🙌👑
Who else thought that Ryan Gosling was better in The Nice Guys than La La Land?
Why is Jay Z like this with EVERYONE 😂
JJ evans.......clown ass camel boy.....the most promoted by the mainstream because he is sell out extraordinaire
Guys, I can't live during your season breaks! Please please please go year-round!!!
Jay Z not cool. Puffy working on my album

Fuuuuck I love Ryan Gosling!
can't wait!
Jay z looks old as fuck!
hoooot
Great video.
*Puts spoon of cereal near Ryan @ 0:27
OH MA GAAAAAAAAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
❗ Yessss.  Ryan Gosling 😘 I'll watch!
Can't wait
After watching Ryan and Harrison Ford do press together for Blade Runner 2049, they should have gotten Ford to be on with Gosling. Those two are perfect together. Ford's dry humour mixed with Ryan Gosling's awkwardness at not knowing what to do or say is perfect.
These two are way too cool.
Jay Z gettin old and making bread for the future.
I knew he hanging out there just cause celebrities hang out there and he dating models just cause all the other guys dating models...I am so disappointed to think I knew who this guy was, time to find a new imaginary guy or create one in my mind that won't divorce me and ask for custody of our 59 children
I miss Mad TV
Holy shit Jay Z looks old as fuck🤔😝😷
This was cute. Both hot with sense of humors. So important ! Lol 😍😍
Watching these SNL videos make my day a WHOLE lot brighter :)
Who's watching tomorrow??
Jay Z looks 👵 as hell in the click bait what a demonic Illuminati shill that guy is 😠
Super cool jay z
Sup
Those 3 children got Jay Z a little tired. Don't give up broh!
I thought that was Kid Cudi
one thing I always remember about Jay Z is he doesn't say much. I love him though, he's such a talented rapper
Jay z is too busy thinking about who Beyoncé is fucken for revenge
Jay Z looks like the camel from those Christmas claymation things
Jay z looks like bill Cosby now a days
Ryan Gosling prounced his last name differently each time.
Looks like JayZ still Oj
Jay z barely talked
mmmmmman ddont read my name
Jay looks really tired this is how you know he has 3 kids now #SNL
Both very cool, in different ways...
Jay almost 50 and looks younger than a lot of 30 year olds
*THE ROC IN DA BUILDIN'* 🙌
Who even asked for Jay-Z to be with this pretty boy? Lmao would have made since to get somebody he actually cared about.
I’ve been waiting for this season of SNL for so long
Really lame
Oh i thought there was more lmao
Oh joy jay z, because his music is totally worth listening to in 2017. The dude literally just talks slowly on beats now he doesnt even try to rap anymore.
Wassup?
Early!!!!!
Jay Z THE GOD!!!!!!
First to comment 😔😔😔😔
Jay Z is cool
The season premiere should look great!!
Jay-Z HAS to at least perform Moonlight.
Damn Jay Z looks so old
Not first
Wa alaykumu salam slam
2nd
Beauty and the beast.
Lmao Ryan is the perfect white male. I think white dudes can be the absolute worst but he knows what's good
the face that cracks up even the hardest of men
I could suck 1000 penis and i would still be uglier than Ryan Gosling
Why do they have the white mans name first and the brothers name last ? Looks like racism to me
First
i am so incredibly proud
dodie, you're so talented and beautiful
what a beautiful video dodie my child im so proud
Im back again and Im in awe at how beautiful this is😍
im shook. SHOOOOK. that scene where everyones in the room. reading or on there phone. i feel so hard. in classes everyones busy and im alone. and i just feel unwanted. man. this mv is so good
Dam that was so beautiful I'm actually crying. With every passing note you could hear all that rich emotion. Well done dodie
Omg... This artist, this song is... beautiful
Super super proud of you and Sammy.
Yes. Sammy. So beautiful and perfect. An awesome video for an awesome song.
I am crying very fat tears
i was getting so emotional while watching this then i accidentally screamed when i saw melanie
how am I supposed to handle this
What's wrong with being a 6/10? It's 6 more than 0 and higher than what the average bell curve would suggest is average. I think suffering comes from missed expectations. It makes me wonder what value Dodie expects herself to be at.
Just watching it to give it views because I've already watched it a million times on the other upload
I'm not crying you are
IM LATE IM LATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBUT ITS 15 ON TRENDING MATE AHAHAHAH YES DODIE GET IN THERE
I love this music video especially Ellen @Oxtra
Warning: this is gonna grab your soul and completely take control.
when the beginning hits I just felt a shiver down my spine
NO SUNSHINE NOOO DON'T CRY BABY NO NO NO AAAAAAAAAA *cries a river*
Beautiful!\nBut was the drink dodie yellow though? 🙈
Goosebumps the whole way through... This is a masterpiece
My interpretation of this is that the pain in her shoulders is the weight of carrying something that nobody else can see (“something that is weighing you down”). When she keeps reaching her arm in the air it’s almost like she’s signalling for a taxi which is her trying to escape from whatever is bothering her. Near the end you see all the other girls with pains in their shoulders, showing that everyone has something that’s getting to them, just because you may not see it on the outside, doesn’t mean it’s not there (like mental illnesses or an abusive relationship). Idk tho
I'm not crying you are
I am in love with this video
So sad... I'm so proud of Dodie though 😊❤
So I think the shoulder touching is an anxiety and stress thing as I tend to touch my shoulder and hug myself when ever I'm anxious and feeling down and out of place thus 6/10.\n6/10 goes as saying that you feel average the plain girl the one that everyone over looks and dies in the background of everyone else's life and this video shows stages of this happening.\nThe girl in the coffee shop who knocks over your drink you then go home complaining calling her the coffee shop girl\nThe slow arm raise in the alley she's trying to reach out and show she's somebody else and this isn't what she wants which leads to looking into the mirror and not feeling the sense of realness (derealization.)\nThen the room of people with what looks like audition sheets. She's thinking it's a good idea because then she can become somebody else that's not herself even for short moments it would feel good.\nThe taxi- Needing to get away because everything's turned black and white and she doesn't know where she is going any more so she goes in a Taxi to somewhere far where she isn't The plain girl.
the message was expressed so beautifully i love this
The song is amazing, but is it just me or she looks thinner?
This crushes my heart. It sounds crazy but beauty shines from within. The more you pursue your dreams Dodie, I can't help but feel you become more and more beautiful. That goes for any young girls out there. We all have off days, of course- but you are 100% at your most beautiful when you are doing what you love because it lights you the heck up. Stay strong xxx
this is my everything! so needed this.
explain why my shoulder hurts after watching this
These visuals make me feel warm inside. Not a comforting warmth, but rather a sorrowful warmth that swirls in my chest, as though my every emotion has been poured into it and is being boiled into a stew.\n\nIt like it though--this feel of convoluted emotions surfacing and resurfacing.\n\nThank you Dodie, for stirring up some of my emptiness today.
If dodie says she's just a 6/10 then i'm mother teresa
I wanted to say something smart but all I can say is... This is a beautiful piece of art.
Dodie and Sammy you guys are incredible
I don't know how you can put my feelings into words dodie but you did an amazing job on this. It's both beautiful and heartbreaking. I hate yet love this. Amazing job dodie!
okay but,,, 6/10 for me is like a good day
thIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL I'M IN LOVE
In life, we will always sometimes feel like we are not our true potentials. But we may all forget that potentials are achieved and not easily obtained. But yes ;-; i dont agree that dodie is a 6/10. Shes dodie out of dodie. Shes perfect
i feel like the hand movements represented how she holds back what she really wants to say. she wants to speak out about her problems, but because of how she degrades herself she doesn't allow herself.
This is gorgeous and so sad at the same time. ❤️
DODIE HOW DO YOU ALWAYS MAKE ME CRY IN THE BEST WAY THIS WAS SO BEAUTIFUL
I love this too much
I didn't realise how much I wanted this video
I think the small shoulder and hand movements are signs of anxiety. Sometimes she begins to dance but then becomes self concoious and  instantly stops to rub her arms or grab her shoulder. Like she wants to do something but just can't. Maybe her doing those little ticks calm her down or ground her. When she goes into the waiting room her anxiety gets the best of her and she thinks that no one wants her there and dodie continues to do her shoulder thing. Little does she know that everyone else in the room and anxiety or whatever the shoulder represents and all of them are going through something similar.
I thought the shoulder thing was that they wanted to dance and let out their trueself but afraid to let it out, maybe?
I love everyone discussing this!! I love her art and the conversations they spark!!! I love!!!!!
Well way to make this song even more relatable. Audition waiting rooms are a really weird place of anxiety and low self esteem
This is amazing, I love everything about this video and it is just what I need
this is so deep and meaningful and amazing i can't
This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
This is so beautiful Dodie!
6K comments! Wow! The first time, I could understand what's going on without the sound on. I had it on, but ya know what I mean. The things that stood out first were the underpass, stairwell, hallway. It was the this is a journey moment for me. It ends up not just for the protagonist, but the other women too. Ostrisized or social axiety, body image, getting verbally abused. The verbally abused was clear twice and implied with the cell phone scene. I thought a lot of the gestures were to convey stress and anxiety. An inner monolgue with the I know that you don't want me here part was fantastic. Taking place throughout a day's time was great. As the day went on, things got worse for everyone. This is a fantastic piece! Very well thought out messages! Thank you dodie, for this.
I love you with every single ounce of my existence
this is absolutely gorgeous. powerful and resonating.
I like the part with Evan's stairs
I think that this perfectly represents everything that the song tries to convey in a stunning yet so sorrowful. Thank you Dodie for yet another piece of emotional art.
I saw the pains as being representative of the pain that women face as a result of society. See, one person has it while putting on makeup, one has it while doing taxes. These are all things that stereotypically women “are suppose to do”. This is just my thought.\n\n\nBtw I don’t think these are “women jobs” as “women jobs” don’t exist. I am non binary (born male) and have worn makeup before my transition so I apologise if I offended anyone by talking about what stereotypically “women have to do” because it wasn’t meant to be offensive.
2:40 I spot an icklenellierose and good song
How rare is it that a great song is elevated by its music video?
Love this so much <3 Well done dodie, you've done it again
So I watched this last night, and truly I love it. The arm actions honestly remind me of how hard it is to keep calm and yourself when you are having strong feelings of anxiety. As though you’re trying to suppress an anxiety attack but don’t know how. So it comes out sometimes. Then when it shows the other girls doing it, I think it’s to show everyone feels it at some point and everyone is different. Honestly this ties together so well in this video. You’re amazing ❤️
I thought i at some point they were gonna grow wings
No you're an 8/10
Such a cool video
WHAT THE H E CK i love u
I'm crying on a train and people are staring and now I'm scared
This is so well done, so meaningful! Amazing job Sammy!! And Dodie!!!!!!!!😍😍😍😍
This music video kinda became an ad for tiger balm by the end...\n\n\n\n\n\nI love it!
This is so incredible I dont know what to feel
this is so damn beautiful <3

When this popped up in my recommendations\nI was like wHy HavEn'T I sEeN ThiS BeFoRe!?\n\nbut then I saw that it was rEALLY RECENT and\nalmost screamed this is amazing ily dodie
What would you wish for? (No extra wishes! (or genies!))
he doesn't literally mean buy that, with money. he doesn't buy (agree) with being called rif raf and street rat. he thinks he's better than that, and knows he doesn't want to be that way forever.
When I watched Aladdin, I thought exactly the same thing!! I went on a rant to my friends and they all called me crazy!
I would wish for my family and my fiance's family to live close together somehow. I hate going back and forth between families, like how for Christmas I spend time with my family, but then leave them to go to my fiance's for New Year's. I want us all to be together.
I think you over-analyzed This movie
Jasmine should have just given the merchant one of her earrings, things could probably buy an entire town or city.
It mainly makes no sense because women were allowed to show there face and bodies. ever wonder about that? they also changed the theme song from the original because it referenced beheading. definitely softening the old Arab traditions for the young American audiences I wonder why they did that?
Hey guess what I'm in choir and were going to perform some songs from Aladdin!
You know what Ben? Its the cave of wonders okay? I'm not supposed to know why it does things. LOL
2:15 What do you think humans are, if not animals?\n\nDo you think we are some magical accumulation of fairy dust and sunshine?\n\nBad news, buddy - we are carbon based apes who share the vast majority of our biology with the vast majority of the _other_ animals.
Omg!!! You guys should do a video explaining the abominable snowmans banishment!!!(monsters inc.)
I would wish to see all my fav youtubers(including the carlin bros.) knock on my door, be able to move to Maine again, and finally have a stronger faith in my religion
What is this, Cinema Sins?
You forgot about one issue. The First part of Alladin it is said that Jasmine must married a Prince by 3 Days but Alladin and Jasmine Have wedding in The 3rd part od Alladin (Alladin and The King of Thieves) a few years later that First charter. Could you explain that?
Everything makes sense your looking at separate events that only happened because of others, so the individual events seem stupid and like they don't match up. Given time and effort you can do this with any movie
😂 this is really making me want to watch the film
Ok i normally i would agree with you but Aladdin is the dimond in the ruff because yes he does steel but not out of greed, he only steals what he needs or for others (like for those kids). Second he was already a prince his father in one of the sequals is the KING of thieves making Aladdin a prince. Also in the movie Genie only changed his clothes because if Aladdin wasn't a prince then his entire blood line would have to change and not just his clothes, but that is the only indication we have. Which would also explain why Jafar only changed Aladdin's clothes back. Sorry for mispellings it is really late here and i'm tired.
He has the ambition and the cunning Aladdin would be a great Slitherin!
Why doesn't Aladdin just wish to change the law so he can marry Jasmine?
i feel like aladdin's whole thing is his resourcefulness he has the ambition and seems cunning enough so what ur saying is that aladdin is a slytherin??
To be a god. ^_^ I'd go all out on my wish. >.> Then make it rain food so people wouldn't die of starvation. I'd be a good guy god. ^_^
If I met the genie I would probably wish to be able to see myself like other people see me. Actually, I would wish to spend a day with myself as someone else so that I could really see what I'm like...like, out of my skin. (I've also wondered how hard my punch is so I could find that out, too.)
Bro he snapped, but he right... That cave scene is impressively conflicting. Aladdin don't buy that street rat riff raff
infinite wealth and perfect health
we analyzed this movie in english and we talked about a lot of this stuff
IS THAT A WELCOME TO NIGHTVALE CANVAS
I click on these videos out of curiosity but I think overanalyzing cartoons based on fairytales makes no sense 🙄
Why did you make this video!!? I mean what is the point ? If not for ruining my favourite Disney movie of all time :(:(:(I'm seriously considering unsubscribing to your Channel
I'd wish for a perpetual cleaning machine that does dishes and laundry.
It may not make sense but it has a point. The point is that you are who you are and no matter how much you wish it to be different you will always be you and you are the only one who can change that. Well you and the Sultan (or whatever governing leader you have).
More genies, reality bending powers, a ship or device that can travel to multiple universes.
I would wish to go to hogwarts and to fully cure me of cancer and for it to not come back then to be popular on YouTube
I think the only carpet Aladdin was interested was Jasmines carpet, if you know what I mean.
Iago is actually not an animal, but a man who was cursed to live out the rest of his days as the world's funniest talking bird.
You say he was just a theif, but wasn't there a deleted scene in the beginning of the film about how Aladdin was trying to get a job, but coulden't because he had no job experiance and he gets angry and yells I can't GET experience without GETTING the jobs! or do we not count that as it is a deleted scene?
You're number 16 on trending!
He is the Prince of thieves.
I'm so glad actual good content was trending n I got to c this 😂
I'd wish for Time Control Powers, also, this video would have been alot better had it been compared to the basis for Alladin, The story of Ala-ed-Din from the classic volume of famous literature: The 1001 Nights which makes alot more sense.
I had to Slit a Few Throats-\nThis is a KIDS MOVIE, Right?\n\nI almost Choked on my Garlic Bread
I don't buy that is a saying not a literal action. It's more like Riff Raff Street rat I don't believe that. He knows he's more than just the names people call him.
If you think about it the genie actually owes Aladdin two wishes not one, because of the fact that when too far changed his clothes and somehow negated the first wish which meant that the first Swiss was never actually granted.
Y'all\nNitt picking so much. Like a grammar Nazi
So you steal the green brothers format to discuss children’s movies and there hidden meaning while there isn’t one it doesn’t have to make sense it is for children not grown men. Let’s calm down buzz.
He really made something no one cares about interesting. How am I broke???
Aladdin is based upon Islam history \n\nHz Ali and Muaviye
Half of this was me focusing on the slotherin pillow in the back round
How the hell is this trending?I am confused!
I can't watch your content! \nThis just sober me up 😒thanks a alot
I think jafar was just a huge pervert who wanted jasmine and the position of sultun.
Love this video. I basically agree with all of it!
All the money in the world, to fulfill my entire life as I would want itand have superpowers.
I'm pretty sure Aladdin remained a Prince up until Jafar zapped him, literally undoing his previous wish. I believe it was even confirmed by a writer or something at some point. They also confirmed that Jafar was indeed most dangerous as a Sorcerer Supreme (his second wish) than he was as a genie (Sorcerer Supreme aren't bound to anyone or anything, after all). \n\nAs for why he just doesn't use his hypnotic staff to become sultan, I'm pretty sure there's literally a scene in the movie where the Sultan pretty much throws off it's effects, suggesting that it's a weak hypnotism at best, and not entirely reliable. Plus, it's kinda conspicuous, given that Aladdin noticed pretty much immediately and just broke the staff easily. True power, the kind you get from being born into a position of power like the Sultan, isn't something that can be so easily broken like a staff.\n\nWhich sort of makes me realize that Jafar basically parallels Aladdin in a way. Both are entrenched within an established caste within society, both are unsatisfied with their lives and aim for the throne, both wish to utilize the genie in order to obtain their goals. But that brings us to the idea that Aladdin could just, up and get a job. Like, wut? \n\nThe other street vendors aren't hiring, since it'll mean that they'll have to part with their own limited wealth, and seemingly have no real need for a helper (especially when you can just raise your children to help you, as is common in the lower rungs of society, and far more common before child labor laws become a thing). Plus, becoming a vendor or a vendor's aid would require that Aladdin ignores the plight of starving children like him, since it's doubtful that he'll be able to retain his job if he's slipping food to poor people on the sly. \n\nSo tell me, what exactly are his options? He can't sell food or other materials, since he lacks the initial capital to have things to be sold. He can't just go into business, because he doesn't have any marketable skills with which he can sell himself. It's a shitty situation to be in, and it's a situation a lot of people find themselves in, even here and now in America. So try to be a bit more sensitive, ey? If you think it's oh so easy to escape poverty, by all means, speak up and let people know. But don't just sit there and criticize the poor without really thinking through their situation.
Do Emojis have emotions? How many do they have? They should only have one, but I thought everyone had more than one.
Ya gotta trash the one Disney movie with brown people
I would wish for Robin Williams to come back :(
You have to be high to put this much emphasis on a kids movie and be serious. Foh
I love this so much
I would wish for the ability to shape shift :3
I wish that I had scp
Most of your points are just nitpicks with very simple explanations.
These are so forced.
Don't we all want pants with pockets
Aladdin was my favorite as a kid. Now I think it’s just odd.
I know why Aladdin does not have a job. He can't get one as a an orphaned refugee (in the original story he's Chinese) he does not have anyone to teach him a trade which a father would teach you and in most country's he can't join the military as he is not a citizen, which leaves slave labor and thievery.
So... If you watch the third and last Aladdin movie.. King of thieves you will find out the the king of thieves  is Aladdins dad which would make him the prince of thieves.. So he is in a technicality a prince to begin with but he's also the poors prince ever which would corroborate with the diamond in the ruff
*_When Aladdin said “I don’t buy that”, did he not mean something along the lines of “I don’t believe that?”..._*
I wish for Truth Manipulation
Wishes what would I wish for.... not sure.
For the powers to transform from fox to human , a purse that never runs out of money ,  and the ability to read people's minds
Wow. I guess you could say Aladdin is pretty... *Twisted*
Abuu could go in because Abuu is a monkey god XD
One thing that's never asked in the movie that bothers me a bit, is: Would Aladdin still love Jasmine if she weren't a wealthy princess? Watching the movie, I personally don't think so. I think her looks and her wealth is the only thing he cares about.
He is not the diamond in the rough  He is a diamond in the rough. He is not the chosen....just a special guy.
1) No more racism, bigotry and bulling\n2) To win the lotto so we don't have to live pay check to pay check\n3) No more depression for everyone
1.for i could fly\n2.my dad see his parents after 34 years appart\n3.finaly,i wish to see my whole family toghetr
You asked what I wished for...here it is\n1. For all homeless (including me) and those who are starving and without proper medical care to actually live in homes, to never go hungry again and be healthy around the world.\n2. If the rules allowed it, I would ask to bring back Robin Williams and Chester Bennington. If I couldn't make that wish, I would wish mental illnesses did not exist. That way we wouldn't lose so many good people. I suffer from major depression, anxiety and ptsd. I would love to function day after day not having a flash back or panic attack or any suicidal thoughts. \n3. Free the genie.
why aladin is still not a prince   because there is no such thing as royal blood     royalty and monarchy its a lie   basicly its nepotism and favoritism combined in his pure form
lost me at standing on the carpet
1. I wish I had a bigger library.\n2. I wish I had everything together. \n3. I wish I knew my purpose in this life.
Wow you gotta build a lot of your own story to make your nitpicks work. Its pretty sad you cant figure out a childrens cartoon. A lot of this stuff is REALLY simple.
Touch nothing but the lamp poetically just referred to the treasure. So it didn't care about the rug I bet
I wish there were no rules\nI wish for infinite wishes\nI wish for a Robin Williams to come back happy again\nI wish I actually had a magic lamp
Oh, I forgot about Jafar. Maybe his magic just would not working in the cave? He also couldn't ask his bird for help, becouse it was under his spell. It is possible becouse he was speaking to good and he was to smart. If not,  sending him would be stupid.  Who knows,  maybe he would take lamp for himself (becouse he could know what it is).So finding somebody who can do that for Jafar was only option.  What about one person? First,  Abu is just monkey.  Second,  about the cave we know only this what Jafar said and it could be a lie.   It was better for him to send there just one person. More people, more possible that someone can take a lamp for himself and it is easier, when you know who have the thing that you need and hunt for just one thief. I just don't understand why lamp was so important for him if he just want to be new sultan. He controled sultan so he could give him an  order to just give Jafar his title or force Jasmine for wedding. And if sultan was under his spell,  why he didn't do this same with Jasmine?  In the end, why he just didn't kill them.  He was the most important, reach and powerful man in Agrabah, so probably he would be next sultan if previous dynasty was destroyed.
at 5:50 Ben sounds like Alvin!(from Alvin and the chipmunks)
I'm going to clear some things up for you guys.\n- Aladdin suffers from a fairly common condition called imposter syndrome.\n- The genie actually does make him a prince but because of Aladdin's condition he doesn't internalize it and therefore feels guilty about everything. So when genie tells Aladdin to tell Jasmin the truth he actually wants him to tell her that he didn't used to be a prince but he is one now.\n- Jafar needs the lamp to be legitimately named Sultan which is why he pursues it. When he is made Sultan he legitimately can banish Aladdin and take away his status as a royal and does so.\n- When Jafar is banished Aladdin doesn't receive his title back automatically. It's likely he needs to either get it back from the restored Sultan (awkward) or the genie (going back on a promise).
How to make a paper bowl ?\nhttps://youtu.be/F6laJnB11vg
What if Jasmine was the diamond in the rufe?
Omg chill the fuck out it's just a kids movie

THE MOST BEAUTIFUL VID IN YOUTUBEEEEE!!💙💙💙💙💙 JOB WELL DONE BBC AND SIR DAVID ATTENBOROUGH!
Wow this is amazing and again so beautifully captured. Have always loved you David Attenborough and all you do to bring our awareness to the natural world. We need to do more to protect our precious gem...our home. 🐳🐬🐠💙
Watched the original over and over on vhs as a kid\n\nThis makes me very happy
oh my god the colours are really wonderful, i never saw something like that
As beautiful as this is, it makes me think of the damage we've done to the ocean just since the last Blue Planet series came out. Not much hope that there will be an ocean around that's anything like the one we have today in even 100 years.
I've never watched an advert so much..
Anyone know when it will be released?
I dying Moe. Unless u have a cure for cancer. Do you have a cure for cancer ?
Any series to do with David attenbough is awsom to watch;)
Mother earth needs us. Let's undo our mistakes and bring her back to her glory.
I love shoes like this. It’s so amazing to see nature
OMG, I CAN'T WAIT, David Attenborough You Are AMAZING!!! Keep spreading the positive message to raise awareness to save our planet & preserve these natural wonders! <3
what kind of sick ppl disliked this video lol
this was so beautiful it actually made me cry
why only 1080p bbc no 4k video
Forget everything else, i just want you to take that amazing camera deep deep deep into the sea and film the beautiful creatures never seen before!
This was so stunning.
Wow this new nemo movie is amazing
This is a masterpiece.
Why would anyone dislike this?
The camera shots are insane!!
Thank you so much!!! Amazing!!
Clearly going to be spectacular, just like the first. Incredible.
Planet Erath II.. and now this...... oh god
Hollywood will never be able to make something this beautiful
Sorry Tom could you be a bit clearer you're mumbling again.
David Attenborough is a national treasure
Wow. .. I didn't even want to blink..... sugoiii
David Attenborough probably one of the world's best loved men....  If it wasn't for this man the world would be a much darker place.. epic series from a true legend.
what is the song please
229 dislikes, has the world gone mad?
as spectactular as this all may be, I am never gonna get into open water again
Shame on Japan for cruel acts against marine animals.\n\nAntarctic minke whales slaughtered for commercial purposes but disguised as scientific research.\n\nThe slaughter and captivity of dolphins and pilot whales are a national dishonor and a worldwide shame for Japan. Taiji is guilty of horrendous crimes.
Hate Radiohead's singing in this, really spoils the music in my opinion. I love Radiohead normally
Damn this game looks awesome (jk) will be so in future.
Absolutely stunning cinematography, and with that soundtrack...shivers down the spine.  Got to focus more on the beauty in the world.  Planet Earth II was a masterpiece too.  Great work ladies and gents.
A new earth documentary narrated by Sir David Attenborough??? YEEESSSS!! Where did my pop corn go? : )
This made me go watch 'jalpari' by Atif Aslam on coke studio. Lol
Thanks BBC, the cameramen and Sir David for letting us see this before it all disappears to plastic, deforestation, oil extraction, and global warming. Please keep it safe so people can show their grandchildren what the oceans were like. Love you guys.
I'd like a plain omelet, no potatoes, tomatoes instead, a cup of coffee and wheat toast
The Beeb and David Attenborough do it again.  He's a national treasure and much loved.
ok, i really don't get what on earth (pun, yeah intended) can you dislike in this, seriously.
Can you believe that the extinction rate is 10000x higher due to us humans than the established natural order.\nIt is saddening.
bought a tear to my eyes.. beautiful world lovely song.and a brilliant mam. genius much love
You know they gotta document all this, because within less than a hundred years, all of this is going to be decimated by anthropomorphic climate disaster. Perhaps it will be as a record for future generations, or for other types of intelligent species or for aliens, to look at what the Earth was like before capitalism, overpopulation, overconsumption, and general apathy of the masses destroyed it.
Another great Attenborough series to add to my collection. :)
What's the song?
Looks absolutely amazing. Really looking forward to this.
Will this be on Netflix?
Stunning footage! Can't wait to immerse myself.
Could you please upload a 4k version with HDR? Thank you! 😊
Open your mouth wideeee pizza is coming inside
Why is the volume of David Attenborough's voice so low? That's one of the best things about these BBC documentaries!
My most sincere respect and admiration for you Sir David Frederick Attenborough. God Bless.
forget every other TV show right now, this is what I'm most excited for
WOW
Orgasm for the eye😍
Wow it's magical  .

God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk

Is that the dirty dancing monologue? 😂

Matching colour again 😂
Love to see you back Gi, glad you've had time to spend with your family. I listened to your podcast with Emma Willis and Izzy Judd, both were brilliant in different ways. I will be using the Jo Elvin, Frankie Bridges and the next one on Monday to do my long run to. Hopefully doing 8 miles on Monday. Have a great day Gi x
You should get Louise Pentland on your podcast! Xx
Welcome back! We've missed you ❤️ love your podcast btw! I'm expecting twin girls with 3 weeks left before my C-section, so it's really inspiring!!! ❤️
We've missed you! But I'm excited to read the book 😁
Just finished 'Billy and Me' and really like it and I have 2 questions:\n1) any chance it's gonna be published in Poland?\n2) is this fair to put boyfriend standards this high with Billy? Me as single now have to take normal boy?
Shouldn't the title of this actually be Recently I've Been? 😁
Hi Gi  I hav Elhos Danlos Syndrome hypomomobility type it means i am am very bendy and stretchy  but can dislocate and sublax joints too so i know ur pain!!. Its a constant battle to what i am allowed and not allowed to do!! Mine also affects internal organs as well, forvusczebras its a constant battle but we fight on! Keep strong!!! We all cry sometimes xxxx
Hyper mobility is a killer! I have it mainly in my knees too x
#20 On Trending
I LOVE the podcast! I listen to it while nursing ^^
I've recently been diagnosed with hyper mobility and hyperalgesia (hyper sensitivity to pain) and it was explained to me as a hyper flexibility or double jointedness in the bones and when the joints do overextend it puts stress in the nerves which is what causes the pain later on
Muscle pain is horrid i feel ya girl
Will there be a book signing for some kind of wonderful??!!!
hi I know you have been doing all the exercise but are you walking... need to get those miles in
At 1:27 an orb shoots out the door on the left. thought i would point that out x
I’ve been losing sleep
Gi, you look absolutely beautiful! This lighting suits you!
we've been Trying to conceive now for 7 years it honestly felt like it was never going to happen i saw rubbish doctors that where really insensitive and i've just started with a new team in a different hospital i had my 2nd appointment yesterday the difference it makes having people that are good at what they do and compassionate is huge and at the moment i'm feeling much more positive about things i've just started listening to your pod cast with izzy but have to pause it and will continue it later when i have some more time to listen.
Wow G stop and take a breath.love your videos hope you knees soon feel better.xx😀
Love the podcasts
pleeease do vlogmas!
Yesss you’re  back woo hoo !!!
I love you
I can't wait for your book! <3\nIs there any way to follow your trip to Iman (outside the UK?)
Not related to your vlog in anyway Gi but LOVE your tablecloth 😍
I've got to say that I couldn't stop paying attention to Tom instead of you. Please don't be mad at me!
I feel like social justice warriors and liberals are actually causing more racism. I think a lot of comments aren't really directed towards a certain minority. People just got sick of stupid extreme liberals trying to enforce their thinking on people. People are fighting back by triggering these SJW. Yes there are racists. And they can be of any skin color. But a lot of people aren't really hateful towards someone over skin color. People want to do the exact opposite of SJWs. If they say you can't be racist than people will just say watch me. These stupid weak liberals have tried to push white people in a corner. Which has caused people to actually start talking about race just to try and defend themselves. Now people are actually looking at databases of black violence and actually speaking up thinking they need to defend themselves just because they're white. And that's when people start getting pissed off. When you try to make a race be sorry for their skin color than you have another thing coming
Pissed off guy saying something with all the anger in the world.\nAmericans: Oh he's a superb leader! Go USA! Eat your heart out Putin!\nRest of the world and Putin: Who cares... just relax stop been angry all the time Americans Jesus Christ.
A great speech not only for our military, but our nation.
This man is a great leader.
Holy shit, this is what a leader looks like. Fuck Trump. USA!
This man needs to run for presidency, this speech was inspiring, and racists use the military as their scapegoat for protest, but this man stands against that. Amen!
This is trump's America. I think these racists undertones and behaviors are to be expected and eventually welcomed by his supporters who dont already welcome it.
Why couldn't Trump's Charlottesville response speech be like this guy's speech? People were actually killed at Charlottesville, yet Trump didn't denounce the white nationalist terrorists and instead blamed the people protesting against the KKK/Neo-Nazis for the attack. Unlike cowardly Trump, this honorable lieutenant general showed true leadership for our country to fight against racism, hate and bigotry. If you are a racist in America today, get the fuck of this country.
People complaining why this is such a big deal need to open their eyes. If racist assholes harass their own airmen like this, how the fuck are they expected to operate together in the heat of battle?? This kind of shit is dangerous, especially in our armed forces. Any kind of hate and bigotry shouldn’t be tolerated in the armed forces because it WILL jeopardize any life in the field.
Y'all know why I'm here..\n\n\n\n\nDislike has been planted.
Can we start enforcing the racism rules in the military into our society?
Finally, something that truly deserves and needs to be trending.
I expect to hear Trump demanding the Lt. General's resignation for going against White House policy. The Lt. General was civil and anti-racist which clearly is undermining the great teflon Donald. Racist are good people and being civil won't make America great.
Bravo! This is true leadership.. Gen S for President
Love our military. Holding the line and reminding everyone what moral fiber looks  like. God bless.
BLM needs to listen to this.
It's called the Uniform Code Of Military Justice. Racist pricks call it SOCIALISM.
Our currency says E pluribus unum for a fricken reason.
Wow that is the message !!!Peace and love from Berkeley
Bullshit Ferguson that bastard.tried to murder a cop.
Why can't we have more people like this guy.  Fuck this world is coming to an end with Trump being President.
i like this white dude man i cant believe what i just saw
Seeing all these comments make me lose hope for America. Instead of just talking bullshit like the military general did of why racism is wrong (which it is, but your military is shit) you dumbass American go use that bullshit speech he gave as an excuse to bash your leader instead of trying to end it. I hope someone blows the shithole known as America to pieces and hope it kills your Buffon president first. America is a joke! It deserves to be obliterated from the face of the Earth. The world would be better off without that shithole. It's true!
I wish we’d all come together, idc if you’re into men women black white... people have their preferences. I’m not attracted to black women, they look beautiful I just don’t feel connected to them, maybe just haven’t met one for me yet that’s black. Anyways we all only come together when there’s a crisis, 9/11 and more recently Hurricane irma. It’s sad to see people grow up to hate people because of their skin color. It was like this back in the day buts it not like that now. LETS FUCKING END IT! BLACK WHITE IDC IM TIRED OF THIS CHILDISH SHIT WHO CARES DONT LET THE WORD NIGGER GET YOU DOWN. FUCKING NIGGERS I CHANGE MY MIND GO BACK TO AFRICA YOU CAUSE ALL OF THE CRIMES YOUR THE PROBLEM!
It’s all good till the racism comes from commissioned officers. I’ve seen it first hand.
What a joke ... Bunch of suburban rich white boys raciest ???   Noo 😱  cant be true !!     News to me ....
I wonder if someone in the air force refused to stand for the national anthem if he would have the same reaction and demand they get out.
Plot twist: he wrote them
Thank you Colonel Jack O'Neil 😋
Keep Racism in the enlisted ranks
Damn we fight ourselves everyday but don't know how to work together I'm done
This makes me proud to be American. Such a strong and inspirational speech . Good job! 👏👏👏
If you sign up to serve in the military but you are racist to a certain group,  then why should anybody trust you to serve Americans.\n\nEDIT: Or other countries for a fact.
Im tired of people shiting on AMERICA  It trully is the most diverse and best place to live for people from any gender, race or religion. There isnt even a close second place but that does not mean it's prefect.  Stop blaming Trump or anyone for the way the world is. He is one person and not a king or dictator.  I am a proud America and support diversity and freedom. I'm Hispanic and have been judget or even discriminated against. But guess what I worked, hard raised my young family, bought  house, and have thankfully been able to start and continue to run my business. Life's not fair and never will be. Not in the wild animal kingdom or here in society.\nLearn to overcome things and you will be a better person and not cry over thia kind of shit. I try to treat people the way I want to be treated. There have been many other races that have had horrible me things done to them (Jewish people, native American, and many others) other races other then Blacks where slaves. Infact pretty much every country or society at one point was built on slave labor. Stop using this as a cop out. There is no and probably never will be a time machine to go back and change what is in the past.
I was put in a coma in 2003 and am just now waking up. Does anyone know when halo 3 comes out?!?!?!?
Having trump as president is the best thing that could have ever happened because it's crazy how much racism still exists but it's also amazing how we're all coming together and speaking up about this problem and i'm praying we can live with each other if not then get out because you don't belong here it's the United States of America not The Divided States of America
civil discourse, needs to be a requirement for being a poltician
Thank you Lt. Gen. Jay Silveria.  A true leader!  More power to you, sir!
Can we all take a moment to give thanks to the girl at 4:52
Thank You General J Silveria. ' You Rock Guy'
He should of just said we're kicking you out. Instead of telling people to watch get out.
I bet whatever you want to put up that whoever did this is black there have been enough fake hate crimes.
first time i haven't felt disappointed in america in a long time
I wish trump could do speeches like this but he’s supporting the cause 😐
Respect my authority! Take out your phones and wave 'em in the air like you just don't care.
Salute to you sir
Lt. Gen. Jay Silveria has never been in a war. \n\nHe is s a highly decorated SJW who has never put his life on the line for his country but who thinks he is capable of teaching others how to do it.  \n\nhttp://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/108604/major-general-jay-b-silveria/
In those 5 minutes he was more presidential than trump could ever be
I wish he was our president...
What leadership sounds like.\n\nA lesser leader would have said something like there's some very bad people on the other side also. Totally hypothetical lesser leader, of course.
he shut that shit down like blockbuster.
This is sad to me i don't understand why black people are so hated.
bless you and all of yours, thank you sir
What did they write?  What ethnicity did they slur?  That is very sick behaviour!
Multiple agencies are responding to a report of an active shooter at this academy. There are no confirmation of shots fired. Security forces are sweeping the area.
You are a hero my friend
Great General & leader. Thank you, Sir.
This man would make a much better president!
This is America being great again 🇺🇸
Don't act shocked when a black guy did it to add to the Fuck white people narrative. Whites don't gain anything by writing nigger on someone's door.
Keep watching your football, black folks. Keep buying from whites and Asian for your weaves. Keep watching and commenting on Instagram and twitter; and being funny and witty. Keep begging and cowering inside your black churches and praying to jesus to make your enemies stop killing you, and lynching your kids. Keep making excuses and being docile while turning the other cheeks. Keep saying not all cops are bad or not all whites are bad. The good whites; who are not racist will speak up for you. They will die for you, they will march with you. There are more 130 million white people in america. The good white percentage is too small for me. Keep listening and advocating for a MLK and it's non-violent resistance. Keep believing in those con artist priest selling you a delusional of a fairytale god. Keep believing in those so called black Leaders telling you not to be a rebel. In my humble opinion , MLK was indoctrinated and bought , Nelson Mandela  was definetely indoctrinated in 27 years of capivity and was bought too. Tell me I am wrong? Never listen to anyone telling you violence is not the way. White people love talking about non-violence when they are the most violent people in the world. Did you think they just politely told the Native Americans to move to a reservation, the aborigines to share their land,  or politely told the Africans to migrate from Africa to America and be enslaved? Keep being black. That's the only thing you think you got going good for yourselves. They got you exactly where they want. Stay black and pround, my ass!

Makes me proud to be Air Force, great words from a great man. I hope to measure up to him one day.
I get the fact that racism is still around, but it has no place in the military, we’re all camo colored and all bleed red. If you’re a racist then go fuck yourself
This is what we needed from our president. A clear cut denunciation of bigotry.
Israel should start letting in diversity. You are a fool!!
I wonder who those 307 people are who disliked this.
299 racists brain dead communist dislike this video because there afraid of equal rights. GO USA
Sir, I think its fairly safe to say that not only have you restored my soul for this nation, but that you have awakened a sleeping giant...and I am positive that you sir, just showed our nation what they have been missing from our briefings all along sir. Man I am god damn proud today sir. Honored to have been a part of the flight back in the day. Bare Base. 'nuff said.  Amen and god bless you general. We have all needed a win for a long time. Take care sir. Just assume I have been saluting you all along sir. ~CRB
As a white person who's ancestors fought for the North I can say with full confidence: fuck you sore bigot losers who live in a country you don't respect.
Wow! As a black man living in the U.S. this warms my heart
You know the best way to stop rasism? Stop talking about it - Morgan Freeman
These racist cadets are gonna lead our military\n\n now if I knew who they were I will be calling them out as individuals instead of calling them cadets \n\nBut they need to grow the fuck up this is childish \n\nofficers are expected to uphold the highest ethical and moral lifestyle if we have cadets evening having the stones to put racist remarks they need to be fired and ban from joining any military branch
I'm so much prouder to be an Air Force vet now. \nThank you, Sir.
Its sad that white military men are racist to men of color that serve in the military as well. They risk their lives just as much as they do. My Latino grandmother's brother jumped on a grenade to save his brother's from being killed in Vietnam. He was awarded a medal of honor by President Obama in 2014. Its sad that it took 50 years for his family to receive that medal because he was Latino and his act of heroism went unnoticed by the military.

Wanda refused the milk because it's white.
wtf did they do with all tht profit I would like to know that they donated it
Can someone tell me whats the musics name is?
Wait, I'm confused. Is this an ad for Exploding Kittens or Kickstarter?
Video goes up depicting a positive subject about the possibilities of Kickstarter. Bunch of people get triggered and posts negative comments about it.. Cause there couldn't possibly be good things in the world -.-\nI swear, it happens every time
Vox x Ted???\nReading that caption and I was like WOW.... Best
Any of you got 5 Very Good Reasons to Punch a Dolphin in the Mouth and Other Useful Guides?
Confused; I know what crowdfunding is but this report was disorganized.
https://www.inboxdollars.com/?r=ref29243666&s=7 sign up if you trying to make money
I love my fidget cube! Everyone is obsessed with fidget spinners, but I prefer the cube - more versatile, more clicking noises to make, more ways to annoy my coworkers.
How bout that Star Citizen game that's currently at $160Million crowd funded.
iDubbbz needs to make a video about this.
George Washington was a jew
Whats the name of that song that starts playing at 1:51
Isn't it exploitative to effectively crowdfund millions of dollars on a gimmick. No matter how nice the box and art is that game does not cost 9 million dollars to make and distribute. The building of crowds is effectively getting rich making a cheap product as viral as it can be. That's the reason the returned to kickstarter.
Because why use your own money when you can use a kick starter
I hate everything about this game
Blarg that was a story concept I had. I need to seriously push out my ideas
Idubbbz needs to see this
Vox X TED? What is this? A crossover episode?
Kickstarter is the place when rich getting richer and poor getting poorer.
Why would it be risky to use kickstarter? Do you have to pay something up front?
Huh I guess that logic works with money too.
So basically the Government in PuertoRico failed and has been taken over as we are having to fund and do everything for them. These folks do not even pay Federal taxes yet we are the ones answering to the fake news people about President Trumps response response. The shakedown by PR has begun.
For a second I thought the title meant actual exploding kittens..
Overrated: Video Games being bad for you or First person shooters make you violent
Star Citizen hit $100 million in crowdfunding didn't it? I know they hit $65 million for sure.
Didn't explain why they went back when they already have a crowd/market
I never use Kickstarter and still won't. Not going to waste my money!
oh love this game!!!
FACT CHECK: They raised almost 9 Million dollars; 219,000 people joined them; giving them more backers than any other Kickstarter project ever.  While technically true, it means you ignore projects who started on Kickstarter and then after they got enough publicity separated from Kickstarter to crowdfund by themselves.  Most notably this excludes Star Citizen which has over 1,800,000 backers to date and has raised 160,000,000 dollars.
South Park: sitting on our asses here we come.
I backed exploding kittens!\nGreat game.\n(I've backed 84 projects over about 3 years.)
Oh man. Why did this not exist, like, a month ago when I was preparing the crowdfunding campaign for my first movie?!\n(gleahan.com, by the way)
Dogs watching this video are triggered now
This is super easy for earning free bitcoins online, you need a PC in order to use this, but come give it a try http://bit.ly/2xDwB7I
What a clickbait title! I was expecting exploding kittens to explain crowdfunding! What a lie!
The reason they would come back is obvious. They're getting enormous amounts of money to fund their projects with zero obligations, risk or strings attached. Yeah there's a 5% fee but it's 5% out of a load of money that you otherwise never would have had. If the world was a more just place they would have been paying 100% because they would have been investing their profits from their previous vastly overfunded, low-effort project into the new project. This idea of private, profit-driven entities who already have huge amounts of money looking for free investment for their enterprises so they risk nothing is a farce.
did someone forget to color grade the video or is that the Vox style now??
Color is awful on this video
Is vox part of buzzfeed ?!?!
Exploding Kittens is just Killer Bunnies with a different theme.
who else have seen an exploding kittens game saying NSFW
I want to raise funds for my SCI-FI film and this video indeed helped me alot...
Without money in mind... a few tiers thats it...\n$500 tier
vos start really nice, and then somehow you flushed it down the toilet...
one hell of a title
I've literally heard nothing about the Exploding Kittens game. And i'm more or less aware of current internet pop culture for the last 10'ish years.
Why does there need to be music in the background when someone is speaking?!
I got the card game and had to click on this immediately
wonder if the ceo has seen kick starter crap
YEASSS I LOVE THAT GAME

There gonna be a bomb in this deck...I DARE you to say this at an airport.
Exploding kittens is such a good game
ALSO, I AM  confused 1:49 secondes into the vedio
Using Pusheen to talk about Exploding Kittens.... :P\n\nAnyways, this only works for people who can pull off the crowd, on the project side. For people who already have a huge following, it's a no brainer.\nOn the backer side there's a whole bunch of stuff you have to go through to elevate chances that the project will actually deliver.\nCards and books in general are relatively simple. Stuff like Blu-ray versions for already released content is also doable. Video projects like documentaries highly depends on team. Things start becoming harder when it's stuff like games and software in general. Then comes hardware, which is an entire other beast, and the last tier would be something that is both hardware and software.\nThere are just too many fresh out of college teams going there for their first attempt on product release which usually ends pretty badly.\nAnd then there's the straight out scams.\n\nHonestly, I'm glad that crowdfunding exists. There's a whole bunch of content that came out of it that would probably never see the light of day otherwise. Then again, I wouldn't recommend spending any money on those for anyone unless you are prepared to just lose it all. You, as a backer, are assuming the role of something between an investor and a donator. Investor because you have all the risks of losing money that an investor does, donator because you are not guaranteed all the controls and transparency that an investor has. A whole lot of stuff is left to the goodwill of project leaders, like transparency, honesty, accuracy in reports and descriptions, workflow, fund administration, etc etc.\n\nI'm nowhere near the guy who showed up on the video... 2000 projects is a whole lot of money. But I've backed some 20+ projects, very selectively. Out of those, 1 failed catastrophically - project failed, company went bankrupt, no refunds. Didn't put a whole lot of money on it anyways, but still. I think 2 of them failed but returned the money. Majority of them delivered late. And a few delivered on time or even earlier than predicted.
I met Yancey at Web Summit in 2015.\n\nHe was such a nice guy, warm and spent time speaking to me about what projects I’m working on and my personal projects. \n\nHe was very humble and gave great advice!
I'm only in it for my favorite game ever
I have the meow box I bought it at pax south😂
So why did the biggest crowd-funded game _in history_ do it all over again?\n\nBecause the man behind it is a greedy slimeball.
My mom said if I get 1,000 subscribers I would get a vlog camera
Hey Vox you should do a video on propaganda, since you guys produce a ton of it.
This isn't information, this is advertising. It's a 7 minute commercial for Kickstarter and Exploding Kittens.
This game is so cool.. And cute lol.  🐈
Pretty good video!
Vox + TED?\n\nAwesome.
6:59 ad for kickstarter.
The ceo, LOL NOPE WE JUST WANT ED MONEYZ YAAYAAAYAYAAYZ
Ninja Bunnees🐰https://www.gofundme.com/bunneedreamday
Because free money?
Vox makes excellent fun and concise videos
*cough* NSFW Patreons
ExplOOOsion!...Nyargh!!
Vox+TED=awesomeness
00:20 so Yu-gi-oh??
not so subtle plug
lol... depth...
Exploding Kittens is dope
Clickbait...you wont actually get to see a kitten explode here
Why they did it? For the money. No need to watch the video from there.
I love this card game!
Why not patent/register it, before uploading on Kickstarter?
Hey i got that game!
Where did joss fong go she was the best
Ceo of KS: Sitting on my ass here i come
Kick-Starter and my exes go hand in hand, both failures....
anyone else just rolled their eyes when he said CEO?
Man I was disappointed this video didn't entail the death of any felines :(
If Vox was crowdfunded the only two people would pay. Podesta and hillary.
Cards Against Humanity!
Please watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvnu8taig8e
Wow!. Check this out: http://amzn.to/2xM32Qp
video is bullshit guys\ndidnt see any real exploding kittens whatsoever
Crowdfunding democratizes investment.
hello everybody and welcome to kickstarter crap
Exploding Kittens is actually a really fun game, you should try it!
So if I donate a penny to 15,000 Kickstarter projects, I can be the number one donator in the world?
the oatmeal isn't funny
I learned a hard lesson about Kickstarter. If you have no friends, no social media presence BEFORE you launch, you will most likely never even be seen. About half way through my campaign, I started buying placement at the top of the suggested lists. I even bought expensive mailing lists to send off press kits to hundreds of bloggers, writers and columnists. But if what you've got isn't an app, or hip and trendy, it will often not get an external write-up. I mailed off free samples to other Kickstarter campaigners who were already larger or clearly have been funded, just to get them to try my product, and give a shout-out in their email updates.\n\nWhich is kind of a weird concept, but now it's almost expected part of the community of Kickstarter creators. I even backed several projects just to be able to message the creator in a quid-pro-quo trade of mentions. My project was running during the Coolest campaign, so I was naturally being drowned out by their buzz. So I backed the Coolest, sent the guy a free sample of the product. He even wrote back and said he loved my product. But refused to give a mention in any of his hundreds of backer email updates. Stating he was trying to stay laser focused on getting his project off the ground and that he was NOT going to promote anyone else's campaign within his backer update emails. And only 2 backer update emails later, there he was promoting some other random product that already reached it's funding goal and didn't need the mention.

Ooooo Helen have you ever thought about doing a video of like alternative slightly more fun work outfits? xxxx
Literally gagged at the same time you did because I knew you were going to say Splice lol. That movie messed me up, man!

You look SO COOL with the leopard coat on with that outfit!! You're looking so slim too! Helen is goals - still watching you everyday when I'm travelling th world!
That leopard print coat is amazing 😍😩
The background of this video is so aesthetically pleasing. Oh my.
Loads of great pieces, especially like the jellyfish top in pink. Loved you alternative going out lookbook, could you maybe do a similar one for the office, or places where you need to look more put together but want to keep something interesting, edge or alternative about your style (why are all the word that describe that look so awful???).
Love those laceup front jeans, really flattering, especially when paired with both black shirts!
Helen, you need to go and look at BlackMoon Cosmetics. They have a color called Cider and you will be obsessed!
GOD NO IM HAVING FLASHBACKS TO SPLICE NOW HELEN
Seriously wish i didnt miss the 50% off!
How did I not know about the discount 😞
120 for all that is pretty damn good, they all look real good on you, although my style is way different I'm not super into the flare and ruffle trend but it looks good on others
i love the black top with the fluted sleeves ! ! 😻 great video as per :’)
I fucking LOVE the jellyfish top in black <3
I have a question about the Missguided sunglasses! They look really cool but do they have UV protection? :) Love watching your vids Helen, you are hilarious and just so down to earth! Hope you see my comment!!
DAMN HELEN! you look amazing in every single piece
I am living for everything you bought it all looks so nice on you!! 💜
You are rocking that bohemian kinda look! Suits you so well 🤘🏻❤️
Dammmmnnnn I didn’t get the voucher 😂😂😂 I’d love to do a misguided haul for my channel!!! I need the sequin jacket in my life ☹️ xxxx I love you’re videos!!!
'anything that makes me look like a wizard' 😂😂 love it x
I love watching your hauls because we have a really similar body shape.\nI didn't think I'd ever suit the jellyfish tops but they look so good on you so, brb buying the jellyfish tops haha.
Helen you should show us some footage of you actually doing shopping online that way it may benefit other people into buying and could show this in your vlog or something cause I just think it's a good idea haha, let me know if it is?
Luuuuurve that black ribbed shirt on you! You own your fashion style so well!!
You look fab and super fit like you're losing weight!
The Jellyfish tops were really pretty. They looked really good on you.

Couldn't help but smile when you pulled out that sequin jacket. Of course you bought that Helen!
I'm so envious of your style, you always look so fab and absolutely rock the items you pick. I love that you try them on and give us a proper look at how they fit and look etc. Love you Helen! <3
STOP. i've just moved, and i'm poor. help. :( Loove your style, and that leopard jacket is so cute.

You still had good intuition despite your delirious state!! Everything you bought looks wonderful
Every haul I pray for Helen to say sleeeeeve and again, she has not let me down ❤
Witch vibes! Loved the haul as always.

I love those black witchy tops! I wish I'd taken advantage of the coupon ahhh.
Love you melon! You crack me up all the time 😂
I’ve noticed the same thing with missguided too! I ordered two things from the site last week and one of the things was a completely different brand, I could tell by the bag they put it in! 🤔
Helen your an amazing YouTuber! I like how your your own person and don’t follow everyone else! I’ve watched you for years!
Is it possible for you to look bad in anything?? Jeez, Helen! You're killing meeeeee

I’m a teacher that wears a lot of animal print at work 🤣 I think I get away with it as I teach performing arts.
Am I the only one who always remembers exactly what I ordered and how much it dents my bank balance 🙈?
Write a script, and keep to it so you don't do jump cuts every 3 seconds.
You buy a lot... Often
I love watching these vacuous materialistic first world toxic videos. Fab.
Aria + Kong = Koria = Korea
YOOO. *I'm an Indian kid who makes Hip-Hop music.* If you got like 3 minutes, listen to a song on my channel, you might not regret it. (I'm not one of those crappy soundcloud rappers.)
You're not a dad, you're a midget with a dog.....do you sleep in the same crib?
She is so flipping cute I just want her so mutch
Anyone that came here for the dog is at 6:12 you welcome
You are a dad!
Yo that's a cute ass dog
why your face are on the cam
WOW THAT DOGS GONNA GROW BIGGER THAN YOU...\n\n...AND EAT YOU
Omg! My dog's name is Aria too!!
What is  funny is when he points the camera up and everyone looks 20ft tall 😂😂
Aria is like my name!😂
I HERD MAVERICK AT THE END
Don't get it raw hide it can kill them
your my favorite in the logang   dont tell him
What the fuck is your dogs instagram
MY WI-FI HAS BEEN DOWN, I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT
Get Logan to Take u with home to Hawaii
i can not wait for aria to be a strong big dog she is so goshdang cute
The dogs are brothers and sisters and Logan and even are brothers
your dog is so cute I think hes bed is a little to\nbig for her but it is all G
Your dog is going to be a star 😍
Omg soo cute u earned a new sub!
For some reason I thought he called it orio
Great choice of toy my dog loves that fox one
i think Evan is a better dog owner den Logan,just saying cuz logan sometimes doesnt care about kong,while evan already know what to buy if he gets a dog,well logan is the same but he is slow.
Is the dogs name Aria or Arya like form the Eragon books?
HOLY SHIT HOW LONG HAS HE HAD A YT ACCOUNT FOR??.?
FUCK EVEN I WANTED TO SEE THIS ON LOGANS CHANNEL NOOOOO 😭😭😭
Does he know she is gonna be bigger than him Someday?
Your not just a dad, YOU A DOG DAD!!
She needs to meet kong
she is so cute and chubby
You have a YouTubechannel??
Fastest growing channel ever is u dwarf
Lol she could sleep in that food bowl.\n\nAlso, I'm interested to see her reaction to Kong, since female dogs are much more territorial than males usually.
ARIA NEEDS AN INSTA...😂Even my dog has one @ottodapup lol
i think that driving with dwarf mamba is better then driving with evan
What is it’s breed cause it’s just too cute
Does anyone know why he calls us dwarfsquad when half of us aren't even dwarfs 😂😂😂❤️ NO HATE
You should name her Bella
I’m just guessing but I don’t think you should leave the water bowl next to the outlet n cable
my father have met him a long time ago i promise!
Awwwww she is soook cute i love her!!!
That's a bitch not a dog
I dont think it is smart to have her water bowl by the power socket as she could flick it up and she has metal on her collar. Like so Evan can see and so Aria is safe!!
I find the whole dwarf squad thing a little cringy
Can anyone tell me the name of the song
So your dog and I have the same name. This is great 🙃 I’m naming my next parrot Evan, just to be fair.
02:17 what did you say you a bad boy

Face reveal on the top you can see his face at 1:36
‘Im adding a little bit of sugar’\n**throws half of the bag in**
This looks good,  I would put the hollowed out apples in a bit of lemon water so it doesn't turn brown before you load it up with the stewed apple and crumble.
I HEARD THE ROYALTY UKULELE  UKULELE AND INSTANTLY DISLIKED.
Would you eat an Egg like this? - Food Life Hack\n*makes an omelet*\n....

Davehax: add a little flour*adds a ton of flour*\nMe: bruh...... DAT NOT A LITTLE FLOUR BRUH

Davehax: Super Original content! Bright Side: Autism
She's a bit too small for the chair since she can't sit yet... maybe wait a bit :)
She doesn't look ready. From the video it looks like she is doing sucking motions instead of other reflexes to show she is ready for food. Not all are ready at 6 months and that's fine
She's changed so much. She looks so small and petite for six months old.
Yeah they grow fast. I have twin nephews (first time aunt) who were born this year and are 8 months old about to turn 9. When tried food for the first time is was cute.
Oh man and we thought her poo's were bad now! 😅
Aww now I have tears because of that lovely montage! An emotional video for you and me, Jonathan!
It was even cooler if u guys did a theme for the calendar for next year
I remember being told to mix my breastmilk with the baby food when I started feeding Mari solids
Hi Anna, what is that book you are using?? I am just curious as my 19 week old has just started weaning (been told she is fine to by her health visitor) and has just started on porridge at breakfast time. As i am a first time mum i don't really know much about weaning or where to start and how to keep introducing new foods any tips would be very appreciated. :) Hope you are well. Love to you all <3<3<3<3<3
She's so little, she doesn't look 6months 😍
Augh!  Soooooo CUTE!
Alessia is so cute x
6 MONTHS !!! Omg
Awww
Scammers and crooks!!!

My neice is 6months and i saw her eat solids 4 the first time it was so cute and she kept smiling and trying to laugh xx i love her so much
Vomit material. This is the modern world. The abyss is staring at it, staring, and no-ones looking back.
Her face every time you put the spoon in her mouth 😂 bless her
You make my day I was going to see the NHS doctor today changed my mined I just wanted to match you guys love you xxx 😘

I’m 27 and I  make the same faces as Alessia when someone forced veggies on me.
Awww her what are you even feeding me face is so funny. Bless her. She's adorable. Hope the next taste/texture of food goes down better with her x
What a beautiful video!!!
Who makes a poster of himself? Only f*cked in the head would Jesus Christ
I wouldn’t listen to bestie in front of the kids the word are quite yano😂x
Kids do grow up so fast! My son just turned one. Looking through his pictures makes me emotional and happy at the same time.
What is alessia thinking when she's humming and waving in the high chair? Because she's not crying but she's not smiling. Not judging or anything I'm just genuinely interested to know if there are any baby experts!
omg!! i want the calendar😍😍
I have the 2016&2017 calendars but I don’t use calendars any more :(
@20:46 she looks like your dad Anna.........
does anyone know the song that starts at 0:43 ?
Hey, what is the song that was in the video?
Ordered the calendar yesterday.  My third one!    💗
A lovely video I really enjoyed watching it :):) :):) emilia, Eduardo and alessia are so cute emilia was so adorable when she said  a pearl necklace 😀🐶❤️ Eduardo was so sweet when he gave Anna a hug and alessia looked so cute when she was smiling at the camera :):) :):) \n\nAlessia is getting big now Aww that was so cute seeing alessia trying food for the first time x
I live in China and how to get the calendar?
Got it last year and advent but as much as I adore this family funds don’t allow to get this year and poster plus packaging take to nearly 20 so I will just keep the Callander I have as a momento
My niece has that pink Disney Minnie Mouse, she wore it for her 1st birthday ❤❤
Holy crap, I teared up at the end.
Guys, episode guide website doesn't work(
I have never bought a calendar before because I was waiting for the one where Alessia makes her calendar debut and yesterday I bought it 👍👏
can all of the online doctors shut the fuck up ? it's their child they know what to do. they wouldn't do anything to hurt their baby.
This is so special! \nVery cute. 💋\nGreetz from Holland
It's insane to me how even though you're only seeing literally less than 5% of someone's day, there are actually people out there who don't comprehend that what you see isn't the whole picture. And these people seem to always be know-it-all's in the comments telling the SacconeJoly's how they are living their lives all wrong because of course, the know-it-all's obviously know everything as well as the amount of people who literally CHOOSE to watch these vlogs, yet consistently make the most asinine and terribly rude comments with the sole goal of tearing this family down. It's honestly so pathetic how people can act so outrageously if they're behind a keyboard where they're 'safe,' yet wouldn't dare to speak the way they do out loud in the 'real world.' \n\nJesus Christ people, let the SacconeJoly's freaking breathe. Let them live rather than criticizing every chance you get. How you treat others says a LOT about your character and who you truly are as a person. Do you feel fulfilled as a human being by always trying to bring someone else down? Ask yourself that and be honest. \n\nAnna and Jonathan, keep on keeping on. Turn a blind eye to those who don't bring anything good to you. Thanks for being my daily getaway from my personal troubles and stress and always bringing me 20 minutes of happiness when I need it most. You have made my life a bit better than it was before I first found you on YouTube. I am forever thankful for that. Keep making your dreams come true! \nGodspeed. ✌🏼❤️
Alessia's little hands are so cute 😂😂😍😍
I ordered the calendar can’t wait until I get it except I’m not allowed have it until Christmas 😭so excited looks amazing xxxxx
I love ya'll! You make my heart happy! Such a blessing
That last bit got me all emosh!
I thought they would've started earlier on the baby food. She starting to look chubby.  👍👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️
HOW IS ALESSIA EATING PROPER FOOD. I CAN'T. I remember when she was born and waiting to see pics and it felt like ages an now she's nearly 6 months!!! omg emotional. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
My how times have changed! When my children were babies, the first food introduced to them was  rice cereal mixed very watery with their formula so they could just sort of slurp it down ! Mind you my first child is now 47 years old so that was many many years ago and so many things have changed!
its so refreshing seeing a mother actually feeding her child and with appropriate baby food. not putting chunks of avocado in front of her and expect her to eat it .
You should make a little video of the three of them trying food for the first time! That ending was too sweet by the way!
We're gonna be here for all of Alessia's first and I can't handle the excitment.
Everyone is saying isn't it weird yo have a calendar from an other family. Well I'm sure you have a calendar from idk Shawn Mendes but that's not weird????? Hypocrits.
Love Eduardo's little accent.. gorgeous boy
Don't worry she's got plenty of childhood left. Don't waste it.
Alessia's reaction to her first bite was too priceless!
Hi Jonathan,\nI have all your calendars will you be doing a signed copy?\nAlso are you bringing back the nevity Callander ??\nFrom Tracey in Newcastle Upon Tyne
All three of the kids are hilarious lol.
I want to be woken like Eduardo 😜
Do they still have their workouts?
do you guys ship to india ? the calendar ?
No Advent calendar this year? 😔
My mum has ordered the calendar and the poster and I am soook excited ❤️💖💗
I'm crying with joy 💕💕💕💕
Aww, you always make me smile. Another beautiful baby we all get to enjoy. Love you all. 💜💓💙💛
JONATHAN THIS IS MAKING ME VERY EMOTIONAL
Does anyone know the name of the song when Alessia is eating the carrots? Thanks : )
I still have the first calendar.
So sad I missed purchasing the 2015 calendar, but so thankful I've gotten the last 2.. So exciting!  Can't wait to see it!  Love you all..  <3
I am crying!! I've been watching your videos since Anna was pregnant with Emilia! You are amazing! <3
I'm not crying, you're crying. This is so cute 😭😭😭
Loved those moments with Alessia. So precious. Those are the best things in life. Money just can't buy that.\nThanks for sharing.\nDiana Dubin
that montage at the end!!
Am I crazy to still think about alessias Burberry jacket she has..is.she big enough yet?? I would love to see it again
6 months already?! WOW!! It felt as if she was born yesterday
Children are the gift of god.
Dear Anna and Jonathan,\n\nI'm taking a moment to comment on your video once again for a very good reason. I would like to thank you both for allowing me the privilege to have a glimpse into your daily lives and I am grateful for it. You and your amazing family had never failed to put a smile on my face and have helped me through many tough times. You two are an inspiration to me and I only hope to have a marriage and little family of my own someday just like yours. Always remember, there is no such thing as the perfect parent, but you two have done incredibly well and Emilia and Eduardo's manners, including Emilia tipping the pizza man, are a symbol of how well you have done. Please continue to make videos and never change.\n\nFrom a happy viewer and one of your biggest fans,\nKayleigh
got real emotional at the end there! can't believe how fast shes grown. can't get over this beautiful family with three incredible kiddos<3
Awwww, look at her!! She's actually eating it and not spitting it out like a lot of babies!! She is getting SO big!! I can't believe she will be 6 mos in a couple days!!
I can't wait to hear Alessia talk. She's got beautiful eyes.
I'm 100 percent gonna be the Mom who gives her baby little tastes of candy before they're of age lol
Alessia's face was like WHAT THE HELL?
AWEEEE THE END BIT WAS THE CUTEST 💖💖💖💖💖💖
I loved this vlog!!
2:08 HE IS ADORABLE .LOVE FROM SPIDERMAN
U GUYS ARE SO FREAKINNNN CUUUUUUUTE
21 Mins 😱❤️❤️❤️
Women can be builders
Alessia is soooooooo cute ☻♥ ♥ ♥
she can't even sit up unsupported. she is way behind
So cute !
Eduardo waking up melted my heart 💙
Thanks for vid guys
Awww Alessia is so cute! And her bib was adorable!
Hi, All:   I'm new to your channel since May of this year.  I find your family enchanting and charming and your parenting skills progressive and loving.  However, and I don't want to write that word,  I am at the computer right now because I couldn't sleep for my concern about sweet Alessia having to sit up before she has the muscle power and motor skills to do so. and her evident distaste for carrots being expressed but not honored.  She's cluing you in in her own little way...please listen to her.   That's all.  Hope you have a beautiful day.
That poor kid is the family’s pay check... I pray that they stop this and get a real job
Its my birthday
*Thumbs up if I should do a cover of this song! 😍*
Love the lyrics, shitty melody tho and I'm a die hard Pink fan 😕 Could be a lot better tbh
Finally a song as good as “So What!”
god i love this
Can you make a rock/pop song please?
IT have go on reapet in my Home since IT come out ❤️ love it❤️❤️❤️
always the most sincere, relate-able lyrics and best music of all time! you deserve all the grammys!!!
This is so good. My God! 😲👍✔
Listen to this song before 1M, listen again after 1M
You’re amazing! Love u ♥️🇧🇷
My new favourite P!NK song
Some more candy from my favorite Rock Goddess...bring it P!nk. Love your heart In yourMusic.
Her voice just keeps getting better and better with maturity/precision and clarity and HEART!
I hope it gets big.
i see there's someone becoming a pink fan heereee
This should be trending number 1i love this song
She's going to have a song with Eminem
OMG I LOVE PINK I LOVE HER VOICE I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT HER LIKE THIS IF YOU THINK THE SAME
Love your new music.  You have hit the nail for me Woman.  Your amazing..never give up :) thank you
in the trouble of who knew it god is a dj
I love that her songs always have a meaning. That they aren't ur typical pop song that are only made to be on the charts. She's the queen of having catchy songs with real-life, authentic lyrics. She never does it for the charts, she does it for us her friends :)
I bought a new pink underwear! 😢
Can't wait for the music video!  <3
Reminds me of why i fell in love P!nk
Gosh I can't stop listening to that song! It feels to me that it was what P!nk was supposed to wright since the very beginning! Such a strange and powerful/beautiful feeling! Thank you P!nk
i think pink is one of the only artist that can put her soul on every song
Pink! you are a great, amazing singer... just love ❤your music💓
I love the end of this song sooo much. It reminds me of Christmas! It's the best part in my opinion!
You just already know, way in advance that the video to this song will be epic. I predict a clash between hard choreography. Sweeping distant looks away from the camera and lots of colour.\n\nI would love to see Pink work with the better than ever Kesha.
This is so great, PINK you are awesome!! My childhood warrior! Incredible build up and you such variaty in vocals head and chest vocals are so beautiful. Still remember ''He mister president. One of the first songs I heard of you when I was younger!
RIP, I won't be able to listen to Revenge until Oct. 13 :/
I love Pink, beautiful woman, excellent tunes as always! x Hope to see you one day!!!
Pink is wow. https://youtu.be/aHlYN3jIRMU This one is good. People listen to it.
The pill I keep taking \nThe nightmare I wake in\nThere's nothing ..no nothing ,nothing but you\nMy perfect rock bottom\nBeautiful trauma \nMy love my love my drug ah
P!NK tells it like she feels it...Sings it out loud and proud...She doesn't give a f*ck and she's not hurting anyone by her stuff.
What an awesome song! Can't wait for the album. This is a great song, such a talented lady. 👍👵
As always Pink never fails to create a song that people can relate to..As always Pink never fails to make great fuckin music ❤
Is it just me or does she look like Rihanna in that picture?
ITS BEEN SO LONG SINCE I’VE HEARD MUSIC FROM QUEEN ALICIA AND IVE OFFICIALLY BEEN BLESSED ON THIS DAY
who else just loves this song so much!
OMG! This is fucking wonderful. What did I do to deserve this?
I hate Apple with every fiber of my being
every time pink releases a new song, i don't have to wonder if it'll be a good one because it's always a good one
If it wasn't for P!nk's inspiration music I definitely wouldnt be here
I love you pink!!!I'm doing the walk of shame too
Look Bellow \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive me that like
I just love you, Pink. Thank you. I love how your sadness is filled with strenght. Its like you tell me to be defiant even in my depression.
In case you were wondering.....She's still got it.
Oh my god it is really a beautiful song! Hope it can become a hit!
Is  it just me that thinks P!nk and Miley Cyrus would go well together I’d love to see a collab
wow pink im glad u back i missed ur old music too i was 16 or 19 years old when i heard u for the first time i was born mexico but now im from usa wisconsin !!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😍😍🎹🎼🎧🎤
How can anyone thumbs down this? Cant wait for the album #beautifultrauma...Continues to get better, more honest and more beautiful  with time! Rather like a fine wine :)

Always happy to find a new story from Simon's Cat :)))  =^.^=
Such a talented cartoon artist! This is so much like my cat. You got the actions of a cat drawn perfectly.
So, so true. Blessed Be my furry friends. Some day we all shall meet again. I love each & every one of yr cartoon critters. U perfectly capture their essential spirit, awa their p.o.v. I particularly enjoy the it's their world, really, & we're just along for the ride, w/their permission, that is realization that comes thru when it's all said & done. We try to act all stern & head-of-household w/them, but deep down, we all know we're completely smitten & would jump thru a field of hoops for just one kitty kiss or outstretched puppy paw against our cheek. Who's really the pet, I wonder? I don't see them fawning over/cleaning up after us. I have always had a true & honest love & respect for our animal friends. They really oftentimes are more kindred to me than my own family/human companions. And they don't judge, so long as u care for them proper. I joke, but it's a win-win, really. Simon's Cat forever reminds me of this.
Anybody else notice the oven mitt hand towel combo in the 3rd short?
Cats are selfish, self-serving cunts that want what they want when they want it. Get a dog.
He threw the tissue in the trash and just said. Yes...
This is the online equivalent of those really bad comics from the funnies section of the newspaper
I've seen your videos since I was 6 years old. This cat is my childhood :)
This is hilarious I could not stop laughing 😂
Neither of my cats ever played with lasers.  They always gave me a look as if to say, I always thought better of you…  Give me something to actually catch, or no go.
I just got a kitten 4 days ago! She's 8 weeks old and her name is Kindle. :)
Congratulations on making the video on #18 in trending, keep up the great work!!!
I just want everyone to know that every year in Minneapolis MN in the USA there is a cat video festival!
Cats are TOO funny and so much fun! I love my cat, her name is Shrimpy!
can i tag my cat in this
Is Simons Cat based off a real cat
I'm in the same situation everyday! 😺👍💗
Hahaha all true and still all worth it. 🐾
I love this cat lol
You make my day-no matter what worries I carry around with me -you make me laugh and smile-thanks so much for keeping us smiling -we need it!
I love Simon's Cat - been watching for years.  Love IT!
Thank you so much for the giggles! Have a fantastic weekend. :D
For that first one, my cats will just try to catch the pen, and make me mess up.
As annoying as they can be, we love them just the same.
Does anyone else use the paw gesture, the cat does when it wants food, to refer to your own cat wanting food?
love the planting cartoon then the cat does what a cat does in the hole the look on the cats face is priceless, Brilliant love you simons cat!!💜💜
that was the perfect start to my saturday morning ...thanks simon's cat and the man himself .
I love the smug 'what a good boy am I' look he has - like after catching the race car.  My cat gives me the same look and it just cracks me up.
I'm not a cat person, but I love these videos!
So what you're saying is, dogs are better? :P
Best videos ever! How could anyone not like this? Ha!
So much reasons to send them to the sun.
7:19 that was sad af
Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkk the cat kicked his owner little bird.
The first one's true. My cat plays with my pencils while I try to draw and when I'm not drawing she starts playing with the corner of the paper.
This is real life for me, gotta love cats
Want to make money 💰??? Check this out!!! http://formoneyonly.com/?refer=123808
Simon's Cat should be in adverts!
WHY THE HELL ARE ALL YOUR VIDEOS ON TRENDING
Your videos always relax me and make me so happy I have a cat .. Thank you
I used to watch Simon's cat with my father. We laughed together and waited excited for new episodes. But now I'm watching this alone, because my father passed away a few days ago right for my birthday. I miss you dad and I will always love you.
Thank goodness neither of my cats gets in the garbage!!
All these problems are easily fixed, get an outdoor cat.
I absolutely adore Simon's cat !! He captures all the annoying yet adorable and amusing quirks of cats so perfectly. I've had twelve cats during my lifetime who are sadly now all deceased and I miss them every single day. Watching Simon's cat though brings a smile to my face and often makes me laugh out loud ! 💕
I LOVE how u draw your cats!!! why am I here
Then don't own a cat. Simple.
Wow!. Check this out: http://amzn.to/2xM32Qp

Love It Simon's Cat!
not sure what was going on on the first video but my cat was not having it he was trying to kill my speakers as it was going on he had his back arched and every hair on end till that video was over then he calmed down.
This is actually why I love cats
This is why I'm a dog person
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
Look we all know who is in charge here and it's not the human! lol
My late Beloved Blanca would never put that much energy into any activity.

Too funny. Simon's Cat always cracks me up

I can't see any difference between the mv and this live video . Sam is the legendary singer 👍👍
I never gonna let you close to me, even if you mean the most to me - my favourite part :)
But what if... Sam Smith ft. Harry Styles
He looks healthy and alive wow
It's beautiful music. Today listening first-time.
Sing it Sam! Sing hun! could never get enough of this ❤😍😭❤
freaking amazing. i hear no difference! Much love from phils :)
Brilliant voice Sam Smith ❤ beautiful song as always
WOW! Awesome song L❤VED it. Exactly how I left my ex boyfrnd, took him back so many times, gave times forgave him gave him chances too. But it all came down to it where enough was enough of him hurting me. So how the song goes here. Is the way he made feel already at the end FOREVER AS SAID. 😢💔
Sam, you're a genius... It's just pure perfection! Even better than the record itself.. Forever mesmerized by you and your talent, dear Sam!
sounds exactly the same recorded! what a fokin angel :)
The male Ariana Grande...he sounds EXACTLY like his track. 😊
he can even bring tears into my eyes by singing, what sorcery is this?😍😭
such a smoothing and angelic voice
if I was Ursula. there's two voices I want to steal, Sam Smith and Adele then I make collaboration.
Auto tune must be jealous af right now hahaha
HERE BEFORE THIS WENT VIRAL AGAIN!!!!
makes you feel blue and glad at the same time 😚
Oh how I missed Sam smith and his beautiful voice
How is this classed as Live?  Was it broadcast Live to anyone?
One of the best male artist in the whole wide world 😍
i wish Sam Smith and Adele would join and sing  together :)
You're an ART! I love you, Sam.
Sounds EXACTLY like the studio version. AMAZING
no one can sing like sam smith
why he looks so hot btw
Sam Smith and Marko Saaresto (Poets of the Fall) have the best male voices of our generation. Blessed to have them!
When you thought it was Joe Jonas real quick! Lol
He's just perfect.
Pure and original voice. No autotune needed
Wow He's so amazing 😮😮
Samuel Smith, you have done it again.
I didn't like the voice \n\nDon't no y \n\nTry to like but can't
.\n(sorry for my English, I'm not english)
Shit's uncanny. He shouldn't sound this good
After 2 years... and his voice is STILL FUCKING GORGEOUS AMAZING👏👏👏😱😄
SAM SMITH is so damn amazing! 😍😍
RIP replay button.

The song that feels so good as it hurts! XD \n\nGoodness! 1st ever live version. Gonna share this! We really love you Sam! At long last, it's your comeback now! Even without the official video, here in the Philippines upon the release of the solo raked the top post in the chart! A proud Fan hereee 😄😍💗💙💚💜💛💖💕💝💞💓
Idk why but I love the matching colors a lot
He and Demi needs to do a song together. Make this happen 💚
i love his voice so much 😭😭
OMG....This song shook me to the core and his voice gives me chills!  Awesome !!!
wohoo new look He looks great
Even better than the record version!!!
His sudden physical change leads me to think Sam acquired specific disease. He's so slim now! :-O
Is it me or he look like Justine Timberlake?
THIS IS TALENT. AMAZING SAM... 👏👏
He so very amazing sing😍
he's absolutely incredible😫😍
Every time you hurt me, the less that i cry
love this guy, amazing voice
Sam lost too much weight
i always thought he was fat
Oh fuck he don't need autotune, he have so special voice.
Zayn and Sam Smith don't need autotune

صوتك يا سام 😍😍
This is sum weird scary shit but, Why is it you either upload or i instantly get a recommended video of you when I'm absolutely starving? it's honestly like YouTube knows something!
Hello Matt stonie..\nI am Ameya from India and your big fan..\nMe and my friends watch almost all your videos , they are really very nice..\n\nSo can you make a video of eating Indian food...
“For $5 you could join my Draftkings league FOR FREE” ????
Yo draft king is garbage but watching you eating a pizza is cool I guess
This isn’t even a challenge. 14 inch pizza in 10 mins is pretty easy. Y’all need to learn what a challenge actually is.
You're slow at eating
Bill Gates may be the richest man on earth, but he'll never eat a pizza as fast as Matt Stonie.
just like the hey Arnold kid
When you try to hide your lisp
ts not failx, do anyx and anyx can be perfx
U should do the 14 pound big Mac challenge again to see if u can complete it now
I spend 4 minutes just choosing what slice I want bruh
Bro I LOVE YOU ur the king in the world for food eating
I can eat that weak pizza in a minute 1:20 not your weak minute 1:29 hahaha good job tho
only matt can pitch something so convincing, for only a 5 dollar deposit, you can play in my league for free lmao Logic
He should do like some type of loco moco challenge
For five dollars, you can enter my league, for free. Uhm.....
How fast could you eat my ass?
Damn dude! My jaw is on the floor!! 1:29 for that pizza is crazy! Congrats!
How do you get hungry in the morning after all that food you eat
destroyed that like an absolute boss
This is an easy challenge, if I'm hungry I could eat this within 10 minutes
for 5$ u can join my league for free.... nice matt
realy u thought this was worthy of a video? really? Lots of love for ur channel but 14 pizza in ten minutes? are u fucking kidding me. bro u eat 100 pounds of food in that time. I can do this challenge and ima  regular eater!  this  is an appetizer no challenge about it #selloutadvertisement quoteonquote draft kings challenge
Lmao!!!! That's a challenge?!?!? I do that normally! Especially if I have the munchies, 5 min top
For some reason... I really like his voice ! Not in a creepy way tho
I wonder how good is gag reflex is probably insanely good
it will take hours to finish that 🍕🍕🍕
Good stuff man love it
I can’t stand the chewing and drinking
Can you make a video where you actually enjoy your food? Lol! Jk! I was full just watching him! Crazy stuff. Amazing!
This isn't human
Your stomach must be hurting all the time
This guy literally finished this pizza in over a minute and here I am watching this while eating a small sandwich and shedding tears as I know I'm not gonna finish maybe but half of it.
Holy shit Matt! You are the man! 1 min 29 sec w0w
So $5 let's me play for free. Ok.
Matt, you should pull up to those restaurant food challenges and destroy it, would be so awesome and entertaining to watch the employees and people's reaction
I'm a pizza slut
I must be a fat cunt then cos I ate 2 14inch pizzas after work cos I had nothing to eat.
You need to go on good mythical morning and do an eating change with rett and link
why do people watch you stuff your face. Weird fetishes.
Damn man - you've come a long way since scamming those scammers at Olive garden. lol. Congrats
https://youtu.be/gGILiLTenR8\n\nMatt can you eat everything at macdonalds? Hahah
This made me so hungry
Eats thousands and thousands of calories enuff for 5 people that's not what's impressive fat People everywhere want to know your secret lol
Do the 20 popeyes biscuit with no water challange
An expensive piece of flat bread \nwith sauce on it.Now this guy is an authority on NFL salaries.OMG!
I swear your stomach must be like a fucking rubber band with how stretched it gets from your challenges
For just $5 you can join my league for free LOL
“For $5 you can join my league for free”
Those pizzas aren't that big. I'm surprised this was some sort of challenge. Most people when they go to some sort of all you can eat like Cici's pizza easily eat 2 pizzas at least. Although not as fast as Matt,it's still not difficult to eat 2 pizzas.
What is so hard about this?
Join my league for 5 bucks..for free
Not gonna lie,  the way you cut this Video and to redo the challenge was unexpected and very refreshing.  Great idea Great Video.  Keep it up !
This guy bout to be sponsored by the kardashians lip gloss next. Followed by Kotex tampons
Tomu říkám pánko! Have a good luck for new record!!!!
Video starts @ 1:36\nYou're welcome.
Wow 😮 but great video, who’s into fitness 👈🏻👈🏻👈🏻👈🏻👈🏻👈🏻👈🏻👈🏻👈🏻
I wanted to see what the hype about this guy was. Why tf did I just watch some dude eat pizza that fast? I'm sad I wasted my time. Tragic.
I fucking wish I could eat food like that
He finished the pizza in 1 minute and 30 seconds and he forgot to measure the pizza 😩
I thought you were Drew
This Mans Could Can Eat 20 Girls as in 15
For 5 bucks I can join your league for free?! FUCKING SOLD
If it cost $5 it isn't free...
You should do a TAMALES CHALLENGE!!
You’re an evil person if you aren’t vegan
I work at papa johns I've done this plenty of time late night. This is slight work. Sending in my video
I have been watching since 277k
DraftKings:Complete the Challenge in less than ten minutes \nMatt: I can do it in less than two \nMe: how the hell
Rest In pepperonis... I’ve been waiting my whole life for a valid moment to say this
damn u ugly
What a savage
Krusty Krab pizza challenge
Love the editing

MY DUDES WE GOT FEATURED
Eating cheetos right now\nHAHA NOT TODAY THAT YOU GONNA MAK EME HUNGRY oh crap why am i still hungry after eatin cheetos..
anybody know whats pizza box says.
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS
Any ladies got wet?
Bayern are trying to finish 3rd so they can face Arsenal in the Europa League  knockout stages and beat them again.
When Mbappe is more matured than Neymar/Cavani/Alves combined.
Mbappe destroyed Bayern what a performance
Where's Arsenal in the programme
It's looking good for the English teams
5:33 is messed up listen to the audio
United need to start playing some passes back rather than just shooting, because they had players in much better positions. This could've easily been 7-1
Lol RIO is such a Londoner I love it it's illegal 😂👏🏾
A English team is definitely going far in this tournament
Steven Gerrard is honestly one of the worst pundits. He talks nonsense every week. He talks about Atletico never being torn apart like that yet Real Madrid beat them 3-0 twice last season
Even Celtic have won more than Looserpool lmao, currently the worst British CL team and the embarrassment of English Football (Apart from Arsene Wenger FC).\nChelsea, City, United and Spurs are class 👌
No surprise from Stevie g to make comment like that about a Manchester united player saying mbpappe is world class and not rashford
Lukaku too powerful
As a Man Utd fan I'm really glad Chelsea won. It's good to see English teams putting up a good fight in Europe right now compared to the horrendous few seasons we've had before in Europe!
How does Costa feel now?
Martial FC
Its illegal what he's doing, not allowed, get out of the stadium
Gerrard always salty about Rashford and Man Utd in general
Look whoever keeps saying Rashford is better then Mbappe is on crack he has potential to be better then neymar rahsford will be lucky if he reaches rooneys potential lets be honest he has great players around him where mbappe didn’t come from the bottom and worked hard
Bt sport are great this year but they need to get rid of Owen
Wrong commentary at 5:30
English Teams 👏👏👏👏 But Liverpool🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Lukaku is the definition of a overrated tap-in merchant.
Martial >>> Mbappe
Manchester United best team in England ❤️
Come catch up with whether my door is locked
if mbappe is world class then what does that make gabriel jesus
What's with the music?
Boom CHELSEA CHELSEA ARE THE BEST ARSENAL FANS DONT MESS WITH US
stevie, micheal owen was world class at 18, he won a ballon d'or and everything!
Neymar right now is on his own at the top, best player in the world.
Check out the full fight video of England cricketer Ben Stokes on my page
I would love to see an English team in the CL finals
The music for Juve made me think Dybala hit the post haha
BT's pundits are the worst. They do remember Madrid tearing them apart last season 3 times right?
Mbappe is so LIT 💥 its almost illegal what he's doing in the pitch ⚽️
Now what happened to the commentary at 5:33
got the commentary wrong at like 5:50 with lewandowski
Never thought the team id be happy to get in the last 16 would be Barca
The commentary at 5:43 does not refer to what is being shown on screen. Its hilarious. Bayern are on the attack but listening to the commentator you'd think PSH had had the shot.
All UK teams \n\nMatch Day 1\nCeltic - Lose \nMan City -Win \nMan Utd - win \nSpurs - Win\nChealsea - Win (sorry if i spelled wrong )\nLiverpool - Draw\n\n\nMatch Day 2 \nCeltic - Win \nChealsea - Win \nMan Utd - Win \nSpurs - Win \nMan City - Win \nLiverpool - Draw\n\n\n This shows that liver pool are the best team in the champions league
Psg got lucky
Fantastic coverage
Lukaku more like Donkeykaku lolz
5:33 doesnt make sense
BT Sport > Sky Sport > BBC Sport
Wheres arsenal... oh wait
Chelsea make their Mark
Roma only beat Qarabag 2-1? Very weak score
Neymar>Mbappe<Lukaku>Martial<Morata<
Fair play chelsea
5:32 audio mixed up???
Higuine
Common chels!!!
Loved Bayern getting raped by Paris
5:33 ...
Haha costa
mBappe 😁😁😁
umtiti and semedo >>
5:40 I'm confused
5:30 lol
Shouldn't the title say 27th instead of 28th? :D
liverpool will be the first English team knocked out ...
The English teams are improving, so far so good!!!!!!
Benfica are nothing without Ederson in goal
Just saying but Lukakus goals were both VERY lucky. Moratas goal was seriously a gem
get rid of Chris Sutton
Anyone know the song name and artist for the song played during the PSG vs Munich Highlights?
Great to see English teams doing well! I'm envious Arsenal aren't a part of it. What a win by Chelsea, just superb, United looked clinical and City will be tough for anyone to defend against. Good for Spurs too, it's about time their fans enjoyed watching a decent side. Hopefully Liverpool will improve to make it 5/5 in the last 16, Anfield needs more big nights. As for my team, well I'm off to Belarus, should be fun. Would love to see us win the whole thing.
Wow Benfica are truly awful
I love seeing Athletico lose for some reason. Shaping up to be a stacked knockout round this year.
Anyone notice Liverpool's game was not shown. 😂
1:54 Conte's cunting the floor lol
Jan Oblak??????
Carlo Ancelotti has been Sacked
september 27th - not 26th ------- terrible mistake
david luiz.. what a liability
Thank you so much Sam for this super useful video....you are so good at what you do and so acknowledgeable so it’s refreshing. Please do also a video on no make make up style. MERCI, Sandra
Love this look Sam! What was the bronzer you used? Thanks!
She look like Elizabeth  moss
You look so much like Helena Christensen in this video! 🙌🏼
Love this natural look... have you tried Tropic skincare products? I too am 40 and have finally found skincare that nourishes my skin and makes it look brighter, make up sits lovely too.  I would love to see makeup tutorial with their products too.
Shut your mouth you're not 40!!
Gorgeous, and making it simple always appreciated! Can't wait to see the Daniel Sandler blushes!
I love how you can share some personal bits here and there, without it being too much though, still keeping bits to yourself. You're a gorgeous, witty, independent young woman. Whenever you are ready, you'll find love again. Kisses from Greece 😘
Would love a video on tinting brows!
Go for it!! Get back in the game!! 😉
Where is your NECKLACE from?
I love that movie!!! For sure you'll not have a hard time dating, you look gorgeous!!! 💛💕💕💛
So excited for the watercolour blush video! I've been meaning to order one for months
You have amazing skin!! Please do a skin care routine video 😍
I looked in ur description box and tried to find the urban decay Brighting and Tightening and couldn't find it...I also looked up from ulta and sephora and couldn't find it, (I try to avoid buying from online) bit wanted to know where u got it:)
i have a similar eye shape to you in that i have pretty deep set eyes and a lot of space between my crease and my brow. I've kind of given up on eyeshadow because it always looks funny. I have found that if I put shimmers in the crease (usually just a one shadow look), it makes my eyes look less deep set and small. I don't know, it could all be in my wee little brain lol. Your comment about putting bronzer on the brow bone made me think about my first world problem eyeshadow struggle. Lovely as always! :)
So gorgeous! If you like shadow sticks, try the Mally Beauty Evercolor shadow sticks. Dusk and Saddle Shimmer are my go-to's😊
Can anyone suggest a good daily moisturizer for dry skin that has spf?? I love Cetaphil moisturizer but it doesn't have spf and I'm trying to do better about taking care of my skin. Thanks in advance~
What a gorgeous look! That blush is stunning on you.
I just love the way you do your makeup!
Sam can you do a tutorial for hooded/downturned eye shape??  I'm 35 so crows feet are an added bonus as well haha (but not really funny) so any help would be appreciated.  Also I have combo/sensitive skin as well.  Thanks! XO
40 looks good on you sam..
Go on... Date on! If not now, then when! You are beautiful and you do work hard on yourself.
What are your earrings? Love the look.
Love this look on you- I wish my eyes were smaller and looked better with less makeup
I love this look! It's also a wonderful look for mature women. This was executed in that perfect Sam way; the straight, random eyelash that hurts when plucked, Ryan Gosling, Chris Pratt...you make me chuckle.  When I tried the Kevyn Aucoin eye gloss over powder eyeshadow, it smudged. Guess I need to put it on over a cream shadow. Thank you! 🤔
Thanks, Sam--would love to see a swatch-fest of the Daniel Sandler colours! x.
Ironically getting ready for a 'not date' while I watch this
Please do a more dramatic look, please! I miss those so much!
Really pretty, natural look. Do you find the eye gloss gets into your eyes later in the day?
Sam you look like a glowing beach babe! Beaut.
This is stunning, I will be recreating this look tomorrow!
I just love your watch
Yes! A video of the Daniel Sandler blushes!!
also your ring is very beautiful!
Please do the Daniel Sandler Blushes video! You looks stunning as always xo.
I am a nurse and work 12-13 hrs and no matter what my makeup is gone at the end of the shift. Please do a tutorial about make up that will last long hours 🙏🏻
Loving the makeup, looks so youthful and healthy, absolutely beautiful 😍 Btw a special thank you for creating the real tecniques beauty blender, I always get so much compliments on how my skin looks after using that product 🙈❤️
OMG Ryan Gosling is so hot, OMG Chris Pratt is so hot - I'm laughing so hard! You are so easy to relate to.. and love the makeup!
Really love this and that dating bit too...I've started dating now as well after what seemed like ages. You're gorgeous so I'm sure there's a long waiting list 😁
I got one of the watercolour blushes a couple of years ago, cherub or truth I think it was called, a light peach colour with silver sparkles, terrible, and I'm super pale and it still didn't show anything but the glitter on me. Plus the formula seemed to break down any foundation I was wearing.
Your hair is a dream! So glossy and delicious colour
“Now l’m thinking about men all the time. It’s horrific.” 😂😂😂 DYING
Your eyelashes are perfect! Do you use an eyelash serum?
What can people recommend me if I don't want to use foundation? I don't want to use foundation but I still want to have a healthy glowy look. What is a good basis to achieve that without foundation?
I absolutely love your Instagram lives but please PLEASE don't take away the fun make up that you do from yt.. I live in a completely different time zone and sometimes I see that you are doing a live but there's just no way for me to watch it (and usually in the next 24 hours too). And I'm sure that there are a lot of other people who are not in U.K. \nMy point is, please continue doing them, it's extremely fun interacting with you, but also please continue doing fun makeup on yt whenever you feel like it! Thank you for your work!
Love that diamond gloss!!! Thanks Sam - great as always!
I love your ring! Where is it from?
Can you do a video for puffy droopy upperlid plus severe dark circles,i hate mine :( sometimes i hate wearing makeup only because of my very puffy upper and lower eyelid
Love your make up and your hair. What do you use to make it so shine? xx
Also, I think you and Nic are brilliant. Love LOVE your videos and YOU.
Hi Sam please could you do this again but using drugstore products xxx
Her features are amazing. She's one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen. Gorgeous.
Can you please do a makeup look for tan colour skin with warm undertones   Love this makeup look ❤️❤️❤️
Which Marc Jacobs bronzer is Sam using? I bet Brad Pitt would like to date you!
beautiful!!! really transformative but I can't really pinpoint which stage did that? suppose that's why I'm not a makup artist, will be copying this one no doubt x
You already glow,with no make up
❤️💋 I create makeup looks ➡️ https://www.instagram.com/beauty_by_mia/ 🙏🌸✨ \nTake a look and we can talk about all things makeup and beauty. We can share our passion for makeup 💋
Come check out my Scottish Beauty channel: https://youtu.be/LC4kC4Hh0V4 💄💗
Sexy and just so gorgeous! Happy dating 😘
You are beyond beautiful
Love you. In a friendly way, but, yeah.
Can't wait for the Daniel Sandler blush video! Yay! I loved this look, btw, so fresh!
I feel you with the hole dating thing. Single for a year now (after 4 years of relationship) and didn't think about dating and mens. And now for the past month the only thing i think about are mens 🤦🏽‍♀️😂
I think you should deff date and have fun.. time waits for no one. You’re a beautiful woman. Love you guys and you’re products 😍😍 they are bomb!!! Loveee this look soo natural!!! 😘😘
Could you do a colourful, glittery unicorn/alien Halloween look? X
I know you both have been on YouTube for years but the thing about you and Nic is that you're always so refreshing and relatable in a world full of intense contour and harsh lines. You keep makeup real, attainable and timeless.
Amazing easy and natural look i loved it.Kisses from Greece <3
I'm sure there are a lot of great guys looking over their sisters/mothers shoulders as they watch your tutorials and thinking Oh my, Sam is such a hot woman! :) Enjoy your dates!
Love to see a video on the watercolour blushes. Would also really appreciate a video on concealing for forty-something under eyes with bags. It's a bloody nightmare, usually just ends up making them look worse. Ageing sucks!
Love the makeup! Always love your videos. And you go girl! Go out and date. Any man would be lucky you gave them a second glance. I am 32 and always thinking about men too! :D :D :D
I personnally love your not so natural looks so much! They do really inspire and aren't that usual makeup you just see everywhere on everybody...
Sympathise with the craving to date - I cannot be bothered dating (the whole thing makes my anxiety problems go off the chart) but I'm also sick of being alone so... I dunno!
Very genuine and beautiful..I was just wondering why dont you actually use a brush instead of a beauty blender since your technique or way in blending is more of a sliding one if you get what i mean..lovely though..xoxo
I have oily skin and honestly sometimes I wish I had dry skin. :( It is so humid in London and no matter what matte foundation and powder I put, nothing helps. The foundation just slides off my face within 2-3 hours and I have this awful sticky feeling like I just can't wait to remove my make up.
@yagmurvardarofficial look also pixiwoo says that applying mascara on bottom lashes makes us look more older than we are👊 did i mentioned befire that u're genious and my bittersweet symphony 🙈❤
*This* one is really useful and oh so beautiful! Thanks!
LOVELY
Beautiful 😍😍😍
You are insanely beautiful omg!
NARS velvet shadow stick in Oaxaca - (wah-haw-ka) destination in Mexico

The guy in the Deadpool outfit is like every single Deadpool cosplayer at conventions. Somehow they turn Deadpool into a 9 year old in the 90's.
I've never seen this film, but it looks boring and uninspired.
Oh fuck that Deadpool made me want to shoot my head off
Did you see a movie called Starkid?
Nothing more satisfying than watching My favourite NC Critic character beating up my least favourite kind of Comic Con attendees
The review is good. It would be better without the skits
awesome review critic. I have an idea for what to review next. By next year there is going to be a Teen Titans GO! movie. As we all know, it's gonna suck to quote you Fantastic Four review. Since Teen Titans was originally DC, can you do something to discuss this on your channel? please? old-ish vs new-ish like that haunted review with Catherine Zita Jones? an editorial maybe?
So, you're done with the IT review, but you're holding it back because of the fucking cinema showing? Sorry, but these reviews belongs to the small screen not the big screen
Doug was accosted by a Deadpool cosplayer, wasn't he?
I liked this movie.
Seeing this movie I somewhat liked it but it does look like it never gave a shit.
I do what I want, Apple Jacks!
I guess both of them didn't notice that it's Taika Waititi playing the nerdy guy. Could've made some hilarious jokes there. Such a missed opportunity.
who else loves Malcolm as much as i do? he makes my day every time hes in a video
Am i the only one who thought this was a good movie? O.o
Look I hate this movie as much as the next guy but there are good parts to it, like Mark Strong as Sinestro, the suit designs (not the CGI or the Mask)
aww they are engaged!! I feel like I am way too happy about the background review characters :')
just because you look like Belle doesn't make you Belle.
The animated Green Lantern movie is really good. I wish they had focused on Sinestro but hopefully the new lantern movie will be much better.
inb4 someone calls Doug a racist for using a black person's fake severed finger as a prop. :P
Michael Clarke Duncan in Planet of the Apes?.. You're off by about a decade, there Critic.
This review had a message.
ya know its like they were going for something good when they made the script but got crap on a china plate
I love how the Stock Geeky Guy= Taika Waititi. If Ragnarok is as good as it appears to be that's another retroactive thumb in the nose of DC.
The Bad guys is a fucking cloud relay how lazy is DC
You should review the movie Lars and the Real Girl, its extremely funny
That CG is eye cancer
7:41 when you get kicked in the nuts
WHAT??? Ryan Reynolds couldn't make an actual cameo in this episode? He's appeared on Honest Trailers, though!
Thank you so much for making fun of cosplay Deadpool people. I can't stand when people do that, you have to be self aware.
I'd like to see a Nostalgia Critic review for the new Death Note movie.
And now his sidekick directed Thor Ragnarok.
Wow, I totally forgot about this film to the point that I didn't realize Taika Waititi was in this. Well hopefully he has better luck with Thor 3.
doug should be a director in bollywood
U should have said ghost rider reference with the flaming skullhead& PS don't fuck with transformers
That Deadpool is clinically insane and has neurological cancer that effects his memory and morals?
I 110% never want to watch deadpool, because of how overrated it is, same with zootopia
I will always and forever believe none of those early Ryan Reynolds movies were his fault. I don't think most actors get the kind of pull to decide and tell a director to not sew someone's mouth shut, or make a suit CGI or the villain of a movie a  cloud. I actually thought RR made a half-ways decent Hal Jordan. Blade Trinity definitely was not Reynold's fault. And you never make the bad guy of a movie a fucking cloud like GL did. So like I said, none of these movies, IMO, was his fault
Hey Nostalgia Critic - you do realize that the Green Lantern, including the Hal Jordan rewritten release, was before Star Wars, right? The force is more likely a copy of it, then the inverse\n\nJust saying
24:20 are you holding a grudge Critic?
Ur intro is too long and the graphics are...shiiiiit. come on you can do better
Me at 23:08 - oh this is gonna be good \n\nMe at 24:00 - i am now emotionally invested in another fictional relationship that I never thought I would care about.
Considering the fact that Ryan met his wife on this movie, I doubt he considers it a failure. Just saying.
GL was not really a bad movie. It was just... average. I rate the Blade movies, Fantastic 4 (all three) and Steel way, way below this.  Plus it had amazing alien designs of many obscure Lanterns!
Honestly my biggest complaint with this movie is still the villain. I just felt bad for him the entire time?
Best part of this review is seeing Devil Boner and Hyper Fan Girl get engaged.
awww, that was the most beautiful proposal I've ever seen...\n\nOf course, I'm a bit disturbed so you may want to take that with a grain of salt.
I'm glad he didn't try to actually replicate Deadpool.
This review is Green Lantern level bad....dude you can do better...
Why did he shave his head?
Does anyone know how to get the intro tune as a ring tone?
I thought the cleche you were thinking of was our main character waking up in bed with a girl we most likely won't care about lol I see that a lot in movies
Wow, this is #34 on trending. These guys sure have come a long way, haven't they?
Good job nostalgia critic on another good review
I recall him being funnier\nNo...no... he never was. Never.
Still a better love story than Twilight
This movie's biggest crime was the fact that it led to the death of the Green Lantern animated series. Its failure tainted the brand and got it cancelled because no one wanted to order toys since the movie and its merchandise failed.
It's tough to play Deadpool because it's a fine line between hilarious and obnoxious...
THIS! IS WHAT! YOU GET! WHEN! YOU! TOUCH! MY! FIAN!CE!\n\nTBH, me when someone touch a person I am dating. Well, except I am a weak shit barely capable of causing damage on a good day. Still, I do try and I can sympathise with the those hyper protective feelings.
Ok...you’ve done fantastic work in the past but the is STELLAR. This show is criminally underrrated.
my brother litterally wasted money on this movie
Holy green hot wheels racetrack Batman! one of my new favourite reviews. love the continuity between HFG and Devil Boner. Keep up the great quality of your videos :)
It’s like a bad piece of cgi that very rarely has a moment of movie tossed in there.
Oh fuck me, Abin Sur looks like a pink Piccolo from Dragonball Evolution.
I'm going to the  NC screening of IT! Can't wait to see it!
Thank god this channel exists
Congratulations hyper and devil boner may your marriage be... Unique?
When you hit one million will the celebration be Devil Boner and Hyper Fangirls wedding.
Thank you so much for the Mexico Charity,you are the best Doug. keep on being the way you are.
That dead pool is basically what fans think they want. Fucking retards.
This movie was crap and also a bad review NC. The movie and the review is forgettable and not funny. It's like writing a youtube comment. Pointless and... oh...
It's Sauron's less impressive brother, Moron! I want that on a T-shirt, with an arrow pointing either left or right below it. :P
My boyfriend is a huge deadpool fan i am to but he is super huge deadpool fan and i don't know if i should show him this review not cause its bad but because i have no idea what his reaction will be i think its funny but i have no idea if he will or if he will get pissed off
This is one of those movies that doesn't feel like DC, not even Marvel. It's just... there. Like Fant4stic.
How the fuck did you manage to get on the trending tab?!
Do back to the future
Bullshit face!\nI have come to bargain!
Devilboner x Hyper Fan Girl = Better love story than Twilight
Best watch this before it gets a copyright infringement
Brrr! Its gucci!
Hey :D
YAAAAAY THEY GOT MARRIED :D
Late.
16:23 Actually busted up laughing, good game
waHA waHA waHA waHA
5:58 TAIKA!!!!

The cg is terrifing

Oh God it's meme pool!!!!!! Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
Sooooo..... You arn't gonna review Samurai Jack?
Am I the only one who likes the Green Lantern movie.
Nope sry only watched this video for 2 minutes cause you buddy are not funny you come off lame as fuck...find something else to do in your spare time douche
the deadpool parts were so annoying.... just do the review instead of adding silliness
Let's get McDonald's
Hey love next time “bleach” the lace it makes the lace less visible. There’s tutorials on it. And those flappy parts on the side you can either tape or glue down or you can just cut them off but take your time so you don’t ruin an expensive wig ❤️❤️
Chloe!! Please try on a blonde wig! You would look like Candice swanopel (:
I just wanted to jump through the screen and help 😂😂💁🏼
Should have looked for a black woman's tutorial lmao. I don't even wear wigs but you have to gel/glue it down then conceal with makeup on
You guys should've watched somebody black instead of the other random tutorials. And the lace is going to be visible to a certain extent. You just do as much as you can to disguise it
As a black 33 year old woman who has worn weave, wigs since I was in high school I'm dying at this video 😂😂😂😂
Hahahaha so funny. Best video Chloe!!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
You 2 obviously are clueless
Trypophobia from that lace
Lol hilarious!!!
My two favorite YouTubers 😍
Chloe looks so much like Blair Waldorf 😩
Wow!. Check this out: http://amzn.to/2xM32Qp
subscribe for me
Beautiful women
Chloeeeee this gives me caramorello vibes 😜 x
Ask Chrisspy!!
This is so funny oml😂❤️
I loved this haha
this is gentrification
The wiggs dont fail ! \nYou fail!! 😅
When I first saw the thumbnail I thought they were the same person
Hi Chloe, if you end up not using one or both of the wigs, please consider donating them to a cancer charity
Pia is the best I love her sooo much ❤️💜💕✨ this was sooo funny !!!!
LOL.  You guys did that all wrong in front.   😂😂😂
Chloe looks like Belle from Beauty and the Beast with that long haired wig!! Loll
That's because you aren't....nevermind. Y'all tried it, good job.
They don't need wigs though, laughed when the other girl said where is it??? while looking for the strap
Now you know how us people who have no idea about makeup feel !!! lol
Next time watch a black beauty guru..
You're both so funny and sweet. Loved this! 😊❤❤
Pia's a babe, kinda looks like Victoria Beckham 2.0...
that was entertaining.   and informative.   didn't know it was so hard to get a wig on!
I was literally cringing when Chloe' was cutting w the scissors! ❤️🇺🇸
PLEASE do a makeup tutorial of this look 😍😍
Can we just looook at Pia’s biceps!!!!! 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
You need dark wig caps and lace wig glue to stick down the edges xxx
Great video! And why is it you still looking stunning even with the stocking cap on by itself?! I would look like a huge freaky egghead 😳😩
This is too funny
So fun to watch
You need to go to a black salon. They will show you how to do it.
Loved this vid! Next time try using spirit gum as it will not only glue the wig to you but if you put it on the lace, put tights on your finger and dab firmly onto the lace it will also diminish the appearance of lace and will blend into the skin! (Reason for the tights is that the glue wont stick to your finger and it doesn’t stick to tights very well) hope this helps!
Both wigs are bomb. You ladies just needed a little help applying them. I absolutely adore the short one 😍. You can tell its amazing
Thier can't possibly be 2 million people interested in this moolah\nstuff.Must be the chicks attracting \nattention.The wig show.
I think you should have made the front lace a little longer then stick down with spirit gum then apply foundation over the top.
My two faves TOGETHER! PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE do a makeup tutorial together!
try to go on the lace with an eyeshadow xx
Soooo amazing to see the transformation funny to see u with long hair hahs
the blond chick, pardon the orange chick's nose is cut way to short and tucked on side way to obvious - makes my eyes feel uncomfortable
OMG this wig reminded me when Chloe had a long hair few years ago!!
I have a new makeup channel and would love if you check it out and sunscribed❤️
I debated getting a wig. But I changed my mind after this video. You guys are hilarious.
You guys are so fun to watch 🌹🌹
pia should definitely dye her hair dark brown and she looks like olga kurylenko!!!!!
Those wigs actually look damn good lol but the price got ya girl stuck!
y'all should've watched a Black woman's video lol
I will take the long wig.
Your $300 guaranteed is waiting sign up today to drive with Uber ---click this link https://partners.uber.com/i/ie9pg\nREPLY
Hey Chloe! Would you be able to do a video with the new naked palate or those kind of warm eyeshadow colours? :) xxx
Use spirit gum to stick the lace to the skin, tren yo can powder it a bit if you feel like you have to. \nAnd also you can pull some baby hairs through the lace with tweezers
https://youtu.be/dNR6Aj9O_ks\n\nLook maybe this will help Next time when u try it again lol
Ha ha haha loved this video kisses from Greece <3
U uploaded on my birthdayyyy
Omggg I would be so effing pissed if I paid that much for wigs and they looked like that😳 lol fun video tho 🙃
WHY WOULD YOU CUT IT ON YOUR HEAD
Thanks now I'm never going to buy those haha!
Can you tell us about your HAIRCUT FROM HELL please?!!
Is it me or it took about the whole 1 minute to realize they were two different people in the thumbnail
Chloe doesn't sound like an Aussie anymore 😂 Pia's accent is much stronger
Yes you need to glue down the side... A lot of serious wig wearers do this so they don't get there wig snatched
Lmaoo 😂😂 you are meant to glue the wig down. I don't know if they have it in Australia but in America we have this really strong hold gel that a lot of girls who wear wigs use called got 2 be glued it works wonders. You might want to watch some black girls on YouTube do wig tutorials like peakmill or Tierra monet they go really in depth and break it down a lot better
Omg Chloe I am dying you look amazing
watch nikita draguns video!!
I loved this collab 😂👌🏽
Loool that was funny😂
LOL! Y'ALL CRACK ME UP! 😭😭😍😍pia gorgeous!!learning pricess .YESSSS GLAD WATCHING YOUTYBE
Its really pretty💖
😍😍😍😍
Here you go girl!! Watch this!!!! :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNR6Aj9O_ks
You girls look so fabulous!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNR6Aj9O_ks look at this and try it again! Thumps up if she should :P
You both are so gorgeous.
IM SCREAMING DOUBLE SIDED TAPE this whole video haha, tape or glue to hold the front bits down girls
You should do a Lana del Rey look with the long wig.
The wigs actually looked really good! Just need to get used to the placement, securing the wig, and styling it to make it look the most natural.
That was a lot of fun to watch. 😂
Lol! I've always really wanted to try this myself but now I'm even more intimidated. Chloe, film a re do with Jackie! 💕
This video shows u what to do, use got2b glued gel and spray ;) https://youtu.be/1NdorSoQ8Jw
Please send me the wigs if you have no use for them i would love to have them🤗🤗🤗🤗😍😍😍 i will pay the shipping fees🤗
Omg it's odd that face skin tone on chloes face matches a skin tone of Pia's body and Pia's face skin tone matches choes body skin tone ...haha
I love how wigs are now more “acceptable” and people don’t find it weird any more. I have curly hair and I’m getting a beautiful long straight wig for times when i don’t want to flat iron and get heat damage but still want that look ✨thanks for the review!
Waiting a video with carli byble you are both my favorits iam so exictied to see you together ..what do you think chloe????
I'm loving my face halos! I ordered and they came to Melbourne in 6 days!!
Hi Chloe, Please look at SugarPuffandFluff. Nisha does an amazing job showing all the tricks and things to do to make the wig look like your very own hair. Hope this helps..
omg you guys i can't this is so funny
White people
Watch a drag queen tutorial!! You have to keep some of the lace, about half an inch, and then use spirit gum or an adhesive to glue it down. After that you just put makeup over the lace.
This was painful to watch
I'll be ready in two minutes I literally died 😂😂😂
Im sure the used car is kim actually 😂
That Jay-Z laugh is so wicked😂\nNever knew he laughs like that
VOTE ALL REPUBLICANS OUT OFF OFFICE 2018

Why Aries Spears not on here?
Jamie Foxx passing the torch, I can tell he was blown away by Jay 😂💯
I miss Jay Pharoah being on SNL every sketch he would do would he kill it he's very talented
Jamie played Ray Charles. best impression yet.

Jamie has lost it - not funny anymore
Holy shit. Ellen has the most punchable face

Laughter is good for the soul. 😂
They need their own show lol
How can u not love them
The Jamie Foxx show was A great show.👍🏽
That Beyoncé impression was the best ever
Jaime only pulled of Oprah. He's wayyyy better at musical impressions. Maybe the best. But Jay was crushing it. I listened to the Kanye part again with my eyes closed and would have thought Kanye was on the room
You ain't gonna put me in a Ford Focus hahaha
dont let this distract  you from the fact , jay pharaoh & jamie foxx are doing expressions
Jamie finally found a hairline that fits his head.
so next time there's a hurricane, think cheerios.....

Jamie. Do an impression of a racist black man.
I didn't know Jake Paul had a talk show.\n\n👀
She WANTS TO BE DOWN SO BADLY LOLOL DIKE

Haven’t played yet, but I know this will be fire.
All set up but ok performance

God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk

Get the medusa! It looks so good!!!
Kiera, I absolutely adore your makeup in this video!!! You look gorgeous!\nAlso we're the same personality type! Woooo
THUMBS UP FOR I PASS BUTTER.  OMG YOU KIIIILLLLED MEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!  Hahahahahahaaa!!!!   Already left a weepy comment about the beans on your insta... these damned, rats, man... they pick up your heart in their tiny little adorable hands and then run off with it and leave you with an empty gaping wound.  It's the worstbest thing EVER.  Love you. Keep on keepin' on.
The eBay charity idea sounds brilliant! Can't wait for that 😎
Sorry about Lou 😔 He will be missed! At least he's with his ratty brothers now!💜
That blue cat was actually the stuff of nightmares! Haha
https://youtu.be/5YRsFBevPv4\n\n\n\nThis is my video link please share my video and please promote my channel please
I love your widow's peak!
I feel your pain, my pup of 13 years just passed away yesterday, I can't believe it, and I find myself expecting to see her come around the corner, and then I remember that she's gone...it's the hardest thing ever. \nSo my heart hurts for you, sending you lots of love.
I've been following you since your first adventures with the beans. I got two of them at the same time actually and that's why I found your channel! I got into a depression and didn't watch much YouTube or go on Instagram or anything and then I came back and saw how many beans you've lost. I knew it was inevitable but it still sucked to see you sad. I almost mourned with you, because I lost mine at the same time. I don't know where I'm going with this but to say I'm sorry and even I'm the worst of times, know you have a support system.
I'm so sorry to hear about Lou :c I can't imagine.... It's always hard losing a pet because to us they're not our pets they're our family our children our best friends.. May Lou rest peacefully.
idk... a medusa is so front and center
I just got my medusa and I am so happy! I have my septum pierced too. I will say that the medusa didn't hurt as bad as my septum but you do feel that needle more moving through your skin lmao. I even got both my nostrils pierced when I got my medusa. Nose hurt me more than the lip piercing. You would look gorgeous with the medusa <3 Sending love to you for the loss of your ratty babe <3
I just about died at I pass butter xD
I'll share my own opinion on the piercing ONLY cause you asked for feedback. When someone has such a beautiful face AND amazing makeup and hair abilities, piercings just take away from it. I don't like them. They never make someone look better imo. At least with a septum, you can not wear it and the hole isn't visible. The lip one--probably not so much.
I also have a poser clock. I use to use it but then the ticking started driving me CRAZY so I had to take the batteries out. Now it just sits on my night stand looking pretty and gathering dust 😂
In a very similar position - four ratties to none. They do leave a hole but you'll always have given themthe bestlives they could have asked for x (edit- god yes get that piercing )
I’m so sorry about Louis 💕 sending lots of love.
Get your Medusa!! It'll look awesome on you!
Woooo! welcome to the Mediator Group! I know its not real science or anything, but i love this kind of shit. That site particulary, i really enjoyed. I read through the entire Mediator pages and descriptions and ive never seen a personality description so apt. Of course its not 100%, but some of the things it go t right were so right, like in ways i never had the words for before. I was quite impressed.
holy I'm an infp-t as well! Do you ever feel like you're an empath? Whenever I meet other infp's, I've found that we tend to be extremely empathic <3
I love your passion for making genuine videos that you want to make, without having to worry about views etc :) I can't wait until you have your business up and running. 🌈 All the best to you and Alex 💜
also get your medusa pierced! it would look amazing!!! i would have got mine already but my job doesn't allow it :( your very lucky that you can have all the tattoos and piercings you like! so doo eeeet
I made the test a few days ago and i am a mediator, too. I really get you and how you just want to do little doe. you are so passionate about it and I am absolutely in love with his. \nAnd a medusa would look really cute on you.
lovely babycakes, Im so sorry about Louis. that's all I wanna say<3
You were an amazing rattie mummy and they loved you tons! Huge hugs my lovely x
Hope you're okay and sorry about little Louie. Least you have happy memories of them all and have the videos and pictures of them that you did :) they'll always be in you're heart and always be around as little spirit beans 💙
so sorry to hear about your precious  bean, its so hard to cope with. Please please please dont get your gorgeous hair cut it looks amazing .My hair is the same length and colour but sadly doesnt look as amazing as yours.Sorry but i think a piercing above your mouth will drive you nuts, especially when eating or talking, love your videos , really look forward to them, love to you and alex
i have my nose septum and medusa and i love all of them i think it would suit you so much! Xx
I'm so sad to hear about Louie ❤ I had two girl mice with my boyfriend, and they were my everything. (We even bought a real Swarowski mouse on a vacation, because it reminded us of them, lol) The first one (Makker) had to be put down a year ago this summer, and her sister (Bakker) had to be put down a year ago this November coming up. I had to take 3 days off work BOTH times because everything made me cry. It might sound so dramatic, but honestly, I still can't look at pictures of them or even talk about them for too long without crying to this day. It annoys me so much, because I would LOVE to relive all the good memories we had, but I just can't yet. Even telling this is making me emotional. I just wanted to say that I'm so terribly sorry about what you are going through, but as you said youself; you know he had a great life. ❤❤🐁 much love from Denmark.🌟
Btw as someone who works as a part of the CITV scheduling team I can assure you that grizzly tails and my parents are aliens are still frequently shown on that channel. Let's all get nostalgic ;) absolutely adore you Kiera <3
Because of you I got three pet ratties called Greg, Oscar and Alfie. They’re 3 months old now and I’m in love with them, they have bought me so much happiness! I’m so sorry about your loss, they do only live a short time :( x
We have the same music taste 😍 you named all my faves 💕 love you and hope all is well 🌿✨
i love your The Room references so much, oml
I'm so sorry for your loss honey I hope that it gets easier <3 I love your make up and your top in this video could you do a tutorial on the eye look? xx
Love Hozier! So sorry to hear about Lou 😢
I'm so excited you answered my question! Love your videos, they're always so calming :)
I felt really sad about Lou :c hope you get well love ur videos <3 !
Awww I'm so sorry about Louis!!
I'm so sorry about Lou bean 🐁 xx
Get the piercing girl!
I'm so happy that you like paranormal shows too :) Have you ever considered doing a video about your paranormal experiences? I would love to hear about them! Also, I'm so sorry to hear about Louis :( I hope that you and Alex are doing ok xx
What eyeshadow and lipstick are you wearing? 😍
Oooh I'm a mediator too !\nMuch love from France, as always ❤️
I lost my fat alpha rattie two months ago and his three brothers are getting older too. It was so hard to watch him die, especially since he had to be put to sleep because  suffered so much. It happened within a week from him being not as energetic to several infections, losing 200g of weight and an awful tumor in his ear. It was so hard and heartbreaking.. I was with him til the end.. But I still want to give more ratties a home!
I understand how hard it is to mo longer have rats... my last one passed around June & I still think I hear their little noises & miss just being able to go to them when I needed a pick-me-up. I hope you are both doing ok with the loss of your mischief. Take care 💕
GIRL COMMIT TO THAT PIERCING. i've had mine for four years, it's been wonderful!
So sorry about lou bean :( Thinking of you guys. The rick and morty bit had be chuckling :) xxx
Plant  family is growing ! 💕💕💕
Do septum piercings close up after a while of not wearing jewelry? If so, you could always wear those clear piercing retainers! :) (I hope you know what I am talking about lol)
Ugh you're just so beautiful 😍
I am so sorry for your loss of Louis and your other rats xx lots of love x💐❤️ \nBtw I loved grizzly tales when I was younger and also I love your hair the length it is but I definitely support the long bob!! 😄
I'm so sorry to hear about Louis, just know everyone is sending you positive energy!
First of sorry for your loss :( poor little ratty , but i think (and he probably does as well ) you were the best rat mommy one could wish for <3 much love \nOh we´re the same personality type :) I think I am around 76% introverted or something .\nAll for the more creative videos !
The medusa would look sooo fucking great on you!
I lost my beloved goldfish, Winston,  last month. I miss him dreadfully, it's not the same without him.
Sorry about your rat bibbim passing, lots of love. I know the feeling xxx
Guuuurl 9:23 had me shook I love The Room so damn much lol
Missed you and Alex. Poor Louis,  but he wasn't poor was he?   He had you & Alex. cheers!
So sorry about Lou! I think the medusa would look great on you.
I've been debating getting a medusa piercing toooo. Not sure it would look good on me though but it looks stunning on you
Soo soo sorry for your loss of Louis :( take all the time you need xxxx he was very well loved and spoilt by you, he had a wonderful life :) xx I found a lump on one of my girls..so I know the time is slowly ticking around for them now as they are over a year and a half old now :( xxx
Sending you love and gentle squishy hugs, I'm so sorry about Lou Lou Bean, but you are so right in saying he had an awesome life, you and Alex are amazing rat mum and dad ❤️🐁
Yes commitment
DO IT! DO IT! DO IT! (medusa piercing)
I'm INFP toooooooo!!! 💕💕💕
Definitely get a medusa piercing!!!!!
It's good to see you again! <3
MY GOD, YOU ARE ADORABLE! Thanks for your beautiful video and beautiful thoughts. <3
OMG OMG OMG... Okay, so Kiera Rose just answered my question in one of her videos... I can see unicorns now
Oh my gosh yes Dougal and the Blue Cat!! Finally someone else who knows what this is. Thank you 😊
LOL the Johnny and Rick and Morty edits <3 Hope you're doing well and YES PLS to the medusa!
I used to cry as a child when I realized my pets would eventually die 😢
COMMIT! You can take it out if you hate it. It'll be nice! :3
*hugs- I totally understand your feelings with Lou Bean. ): I spent almost the whole week before Kari had to be pts crying because I just knew the surgery didn't work and there was nothing left to be done, because hand feeding just wasn't helping. UGH now I'm tearing up. lol\n\nI honestly don't blame you for skipping the if you'll get more question (be it you meant to or just didn't see it). I currently still have 3 and have lost 3, in the same three years PLUS 4 I took in to help after Hurricane Harvey. I'm honestly wondering if I really want more after this or not...\n\nI will forever love rats but between the loss and heart break, we're also finally taking the steps to get our first home and save towards the wedding (and to go to a friend's wedding across the country!), I just don't know if I would be able to take on more after this. v.v
I’m an INFP too!
I'm so sorry for your loss Kiera. I always enjoyed your rat videos a lot and they're are the reason I found your channel! Much love and stay strong x
I pass butter... Every time I think I couldn't love you any more... 😂
I am a mediator too! Apparently we make up just 4% of the population. No wonder I have no friends XD
Love you lady x <3
u are so 70s omg. also ur hair looks gorgeous!!
I ASKED A TATTOO QUESTION AND YOU MAY DO A TATTOO QUESTION VIDEO YASSSSSSSSSSSS, Sorry about your little beans! <3 I have 4 ratties and i cant bare to think about when my beans are gone :(
I’m so Sorry to hear about Louis. ❤️ BTW you have beautiful porcelain skin 💚
Yay! Ive missed seeing a notification for a new video upload from you. So sorry about Lou bean 💔💔 xx
Dougal and the blue cat is one of my favourite films! I'm so glad you know what it is!! Ps I love your videos xx
Sending you love regarding Louie. He had such an amazing life and was so lucky to have you as his mom. ❤️
Cafe Bean is the coffee shop right beside my office
I'm an INFP-T as well! We're emotional little things! Haha. \nBut I wanted to say that I'm sending you warm hugs and happy vibes when it comes to your loss. I don't pray, so this is my way of saying I'm sorry and that I wish you the best!💕
love u kiera, louie lives forever in so many hearts and yours and alex's especially. Now he's with the rest of all the ratties that once were so loved on this plane still being loved just on a different plane.
We have the same personality type! No wonder you're my favorite YouTuber!
So Sorry about Louis. 💗💗💗
PIERCE IT! PIERCE IT! PIERCE IT!
im sorry about your loss :/ i hope you feel better 💛 // p.s. im an ENFP!! so cloooose hahah
After I lost all my ratties I thought I would never want to be a little fuzzy mum again, then I rescued a ferret :| ( the charity was going to kill him because no one wanted him ). I have never looked back, he's such a character, and so so funny. Just a thought.
so sorry to hear about little louis, at least he's with the other boys now 🌈💖 sending loads of love ur way. thank u for being such a fantastic rat mummy & giving these lovely boys a wonderful life 💕
Can you please post a link to your ebay?
The Medusa piercing would look cool but just know if you would ever want to take it out that it will leave a very noticeable scar
Whatever happened to your vlogging channel?? I've always been curious since you used to make vlogging vids on that channel and then all of a sudden you stopped making them? Hope all is well x
Eyelash glue a little screw top/ ball top piercing to your lip and test if you like a medusa
Idk if you've had mouth piercings before, but I wouldn't  recommend it if you don't see yourself committed to it. Not that it wouldn't look good on you, but it can scar your face permanently

HAHAHA you do look like Greizmann sorta you could defs be like cousins 😂
Been doing this for seven years. Thanks for validating my methods, science.
Yes,im bad,I from Russia.
I'm pretty bad at history, so, at the end of the last year's school year I decided I wanted some sort of speaker. My parents said you will get a speaker ONLY if you get a 100% on the last test, OK?\nThat made me SO motivated that I got 100% on the test.
I'm trying to learn the order of the electro magnetic spectrum in increasing range of frequency
wow my exams just got over but anyways great tips ASAPscience!!
What if u have lost memory like me ?
But what if you used a tablet and used an app like notability to write notes with a stylus?
All this trying to get my head around different ways to study has made me forgett what im actually studying . Not Coooool
I'm not understanding all these people in the comment section saying  I have exam tomorrow . School just started lol
the sleep-study sleep thing at 0:44 -- doesn't it sound like the same thing on both sides (at least the way they explained it). Am I missing something here?
I got diagnostic exam coming for me and im going to use this
What happens if you only eat meat?
I need to learn math quickly cuz my teacher is way to fast and I can’t keep up... I feel like a Potatoe when they’re teaching
I have the brilliant app it soooo go
Perfect timing for this video.\nStudying for my 3rd financial license. Sometimes testing doesn't just end when school ends lol.\nHandwriting paraphrased notes truly does help. So glad that's a proven method!
Is Beyonce an alien?\nI m done
First rule is to  overthrow the US school system, they are doing a pretty terrible job.
Crazy thing is this was always my strategy since I started college a couple years ago. The biggest thing for me is to study right before I sleep and wake up with the material on my mind and testing myself early. I discovered all these on my own. I do all this except rewarding myself. Not exactly balling like that.  Another thing I do is look out for songs when learning things like geography for my international affairs class. I memorize exponentially faster doing that or watching interesting videos on the topics being covered.
I got all A's\n\n\n\n\n\nExcept for math :( 64%
No laptop, write it.     Study, sleep.     Exercise (endorphin).    Say loud.     Stay hydrated.     Reward yourself. (hang out, maybe go shopping, movie theater or do something that you Love)
Omg this vid is great for the upcoming school year and thank you for the referral to check out Brilliant!!! It's helping me tons for my physics test on Monday! :-)
Also, does anyone have a site for making mnemonics? Aside from acronyms, I'm interested in using words for numbers. For example numbers for 7.
Who else is watching this a week or two before tests?
I do a lot of this actually. I would add that once you learn something, pretend that you're teaching the material to someone. Being comfortable teaching on a subject is a clear indicator you not only remember the material, but you also understood it.
Good, a useful video for once.
I run around in circles that works for me
1:53 even a quick walk around the ..... wat
Can you do how to learn how to draw faster? Cause I feel that it's a different method for it
I should be studying... but im watching how to learn faster...
Ooh, they're trying out some new techniques!  Becoming a comic book artist!
so is it better to study morning > night > morning > night > morning ...  or study > sleep > study > sleep > study ???
As a teacher, I was extremely disappointed that you joined the school privatization movement. https://medium.com/march-for-public-education/i-watched-xq-americas-xq-super-schools-live-so-you-don-t-need-to-you-re-welcome-21802b416248
Honor's English be like...
Guys, check out my latest social experiment 👇\n\nhttps://youtu.be/KF6gRtt9DdA
And here is the next big con. Learn faster. Being able to understand what your learning is far more important. Schools don't teach you how to think. They only teach you how to remember with pneumonic memory aids. ... It's like telling someone here is how you drive a car. If you don't understand I just proved my point.
great, i found this when my exams just finished.
This video is silly all you have to do is use shadow clone jutsu
im not a superior white male, so i cannot learn anything.  white people have quintuple the iq of negros, this has scientifically been proven to be true over and over again.  #preservethewhiterace
On Monday I have a quiz in Latin 1.\nThanks AsapSCIENCE!
What was the computer task.
It's the same guy that complained on your other channels, PLEASE be specific about the research (for example: research by this university shows this)
The first point you made about paper being better than computer is only true because on a computer, you type way faster. Because you type faster, you start to copy word for word and don't really process what they are saying. Crashcourse made a video about this
I have an AP human geo exam hopefully this helps😭😭😭
0:24\nIs Beyoncé and alien? Lol. The internet would definitely have something like that these days.
I study for 5 minutes and sleep for 8 hrs then study for 5 minutes again and repeat.
You just gotta pop some of those pills from Limitless and there you go, problem solved
Get a very specific form of autism to learn faster, which stinks for most people because they are gene based.
Ah no wonder my memory and ability to recall random facts is better now that I work full time.... I’m getting paid to remember 😂😂😂
but I dont like to learn ;P
All cited studies were either one offs or very very small sample sizes with no control. How can that be called science, and not media pap?
Today Anton Zeilinger and a professor in Beijing talked over a quantum encrypted line:\nhttp://science.orf.at/stories/2869341/ (German)
Sing a song about what your trying to learn so you remember a song not just words it like learning the alphabet
what I do is write everything down word by word an read it, I don't know why it works but it does.
Could you do a what would happen if the internet went down for an hour video?
Good\nBurritos\nDon't\nFall\nApart\n\nis what I use for the scale

There's some great information in this video, some I've heard of and used and some new ideas experiment with. Thanks for creating it :)
Why the title is in Portuguese?
*The best way* is just to stop reading my comment and go revise !

Khan academy is much better than Brilliant. Khan academy is free. Brilliant costs $8/month. Soooo....
*how to learn efficiently
Instructions weren't clear enough, i got addicted to heroin while studying.
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
Literally stopped the video, grabbed my notebook, restarted the video, and then took notes as the video was going on.
I do nearly all of this and calc still fucks me up I have no idea what's going on in that class currently
So Michael Scott was right all along
Sure money is great for learning. But if you are on a creative task, increased rewards actually cause decreased performance. \n\nAs we transition to a creativity-based economy and robots replace menial tasks, it is perhaps good to ask ourselves if the traditional reward system can sustain itself.
lol pls tell me this is useful I'm such a slow loner
Since I don't have friends to study with, I imagine an audience and I'm teaching teach them. Haha. Trust me. It works. Haha
This video is wrong all you have to do is literally not do anything\nIn here and this is only a advertisement for a website don’t trust \nIt  al you literally have to do is absolutely just saying you have to \n\nRead more
I'm spending my the time I should be studying by watching this video, so I hope this will be worth it
Basing shit on 86 people wow. It like political polls were like 2k Americans equals the view of everyone.

This is the 3rd British Youtuber in a week with the exact same vlog format for this lipstick brand AD. I mean, I'm not mad cause I like your vlogs and you got to pay your bills but they're really over-saturating YouTube with this campaign.
I've seen other british youtubers do the Bourjois lipstick test, and their video was marked as an AD. Isn't this one an AD as well?
What was the name of your Jo Malone perfume?  You're gorgeous!
I love the coat.
love the 2nd jumper and the boss bitch coat lol! :)
Love to watch your videos Sam. You look amazing wearing that lipstick and your hair looks so so nice too. You seem so happy and I'm glad for you 🤗 Love the coat and I'm in love with that blue ruffle dress 😍😍😍 Lots of love from Holland
i'm going to head up to london i thought she would be living in london. Anyone can help me here?
I live in Amsterdam and tried the same coat in & other stories! Loved it! So soft. But was a bit worried about all the rain in fall and winter. What do you think? Will it ruin the coat..?
Just watched about 8 of your vlogs 😂😂 #sammicatchup but seriously loved every single one!
❤ your vids so much . You have great understated style
Loved it:) def would enjoy if you do those more :) xx love the coat, suits you so well
I love this video! Here in Denmark we have a coat/Blazer that reminds you very much of the one you looked at in Mango. It's called 'neo noir wales coat', and it's really good quality, and it fits so well!! <3
YES PLEASE, do more videos like this if you can, seriously it makes me feel like I'm with you, going around shopping :D and also its obviously so awesome to be able to see what kind of staple pieces you choose to buy!
I haven't watched you before but this was fun!
I really enjoy come shopping with me videos (:
Yes more videos like this please! Love your coat btw! 👏
That blue coat on you was EVERYTHING 😍😍
The lipsticks look great. And the color you chose looks great. I just feel like they will be so drying. All the long lasting ones are. I might try one. Love the coat you bought.
Love these type of videoes! Definitely do more please! xx
Yeah made my day as usual
I loved the blue one as well :) You looked very nice with it too. Probably I'm telling you because I love blue color.
where are your boots from?
Love the video I need to go shopping with u lol 🙌🏼✨
You didn't really pick the best colour to be testing out because it's so similar to your lip colour. Just a suggestion to try a darker or bolder colour next time
I loooooove the first red sweater
God this channel is shit..
I loveeee ❤️ the black boots. Does anyone know the brand of the boots?
I am OBSESSED with the coat!! I need something like it in my life!
Which red jumper did you choose? My favourite was the second one
If I were to visit London, I would ask you to go shopping with me! love your blogs sam!
Absolutely LOVE the coat 😍
The coat looks so good on you! I definitely think you made the right choice - stylish and classy 😍 xoxo
yaaay I love this blog. where are the high shine pointed boots you were wearing from? x
<3 You pull of so many looks. Love your style. You inspire me to create my own style and experiment out of my comfort zone.
I'd love to see more of these videos 🙌🏼
😍 Oh I love love the black coat! It looks so great on you. I'm from Florida so of corse we don't get the weather to wear a coat like that. Also the earrings are beautiful!
It's interesting to see you debate investing on a winter coat since those are the things I find myself willingly splurging on. About 5 years ago I bought a €150 coat and a €50 and while the first one is still going strong, the second has been replaced after a year of wear because it was wrecked. I would rather invest in such a staple than in trendier pieces such as jackets and shirts.
You look so happy! Love seeing you this way 😊❤
Loved this video!! I really love how we get to see  the thought process behind what you choose to buy and not just the haul portion of the video. By the way what foundation are you wearing because your makeup looks amazing in this video :)
This hair color and texture reminds me of Mariah Carey in the 90s
Well done for vlogging when it was so busy!!! I think I would have chickened out xx
Almost 500k!!! I remember watching your get ready with me while you were in uni
I enjoy your videos because your personality isn't fake and cloying. You just seem authentic and down to earth.
anyone know the song in the back at 6:07?
Song name and artist please @6.23
Loving your hair right now Sam!  The colour the texture, it's so suits you!
When you showef the lip color range; my eye went straight to the color you chose to wear.  It's a lovely color. Good choice girlie. Also, you looked really good in the orangy-red jumper. It was a nice Fall color.
Please do more of these!!! So in love with the coat, great video :)
Hi Sammi, just curious why don't you wear blush?
Love it! Samy where is your bag from?
The second red jumper looked lovely on you, I hope you bought it x
I love this video style and hearing your thought process about picking out pieces and then deciding which one to get if you do buy one
I love seeing your shopping videos
Really enjoyed this.  The coat looks amazing but truthfully, everything you tried on looked beautiful.  I actually really liked the second red jumper but I know comfort is important and that material is far too itchy scratchy for my liking. Anyway, thanks for a lovely vlog.
The coat is lovely and you look so good in it, lovely vlog Sammi 💕👍🏻
For all the American ladies, Target (yes babygirl, Target) has a Prince of Wales check blazer for 34.99 that KILLS. I was floored at the quality and fit. Karenbritchick put me on to this and I will love her forever for it. Go get it while you can. The size is spot on but I sized up because I like a little slouch and give. It really is a jewel and a quality bargain. . I wish you could get your hands on one Sammy. Ok back to watching, lol.
Where is that leopard print bag from?? I NEEEEED 💕
The music🎵 in the fitting room 6:22 😍😍 ??
that lipstick looks so pretty on you, I might have to look at it tomorrow, also I love how effortless your style is!! Inspo!
Looking beautiful as ever Sam, please do more london guides they are EVERYTHING to me!
You just have the best style !\nYou have influenced me so much lately, I think you're always very classy and stylish at the same time. \nXoxo
Wow I love that coat, perfect staple 😍
WHERE ARE YOUR SHOES FROM????? NEEEEED
Love the coat! You look so good!
Loved the vlog!  Thanks for sharing it with us.  btw love the coat!
I liked the two turtleneck red sweaters the best
I'll definitely try their new products out the highlighters and shadows have been a staple of mine for years, I wonder if they have anything else new haha. Btw if you see this please could u share the shade of your foundation as we're exactly the same tone ❤️
Loved this! Yes pls do more shopping in London videos. Have always wanted to visit & this gives me a great view into where to go
I love watching your shopping vlogz 😍everything is gorgeous 👍
🖤 Those Earrings!!! 🖤 And 💄 Held Up Well Throughout the Day!!!👍🏽
I would love to see whether the dark colours would wear as well, bc that colour pink can easily blend into your natural lip colour
Loved following you round! Also, as a longtime subscriber it was cool because I knew which pieces were more Sam haha. 😘\n\nI think I will wait a while before getting the bourjois lipsticks.. whenever a brand does a big campaign and sponsors a lot of Youtubers etc, it makes me suspicious. Lol. I want a product that sells itself.
Loved everything about this video!
Love watching your shop.
Love your shopping vlogs keep them coming
Just so enjoyable god bless you and your family Samantha
I really liked how you addressed that it's an ad video. Even though it's sponsored, it's genuine. There are some bloggers that market a product too much and just seem fake while doing it. You did it in a way that I see that it's a great product and you describe it as it fitting into your lifestyle.
That BLUE coat!!💙🌀🔷. Far from plain, it POPS!!
Love your style :D
Love the vlog, Sam 💕
One word - Lint Roller.  Beautiful coat. x
❤️💜🖤💛💙💚
Loved this video!
Thank you Sammi!! Love your vlogs :) <3
love that coat!
Love your vlogs! Xx
Really enjoyed this hun xx
You are amazing
I just  💖💖💖💖💖💖💖 Indie
This coat!! Stunning!!
Yes more please
Love it !
Sammi, would you ever try box braids?
7:27 Daphne
OMG i work at muji in NYC!! :DDD
loooove your brows!!
ZARA have lovely jumpers in atm! ;)
those earrings are so amazing! <3
how much money did you pay youtube to be trending
Yesssss Sammi! You are so great at styling I love videos like this
Tamar looks great! I can't believe she is 40 years old. She looks late 20s early 30s.
Wendy if somebody is willing to give the tea shush lol
Why dont she just change management keep businesses businesses and family family and  like TayTay came so far  with her career We love your Voice. You are a great singer. I know shes not quit  music but damn i want a nother abulm like Calling all lover the New one its alright but hey  I  love her though.
Tamar, I hope the designer of those boots you're wearing is paying you a fee to promote their brand. Ijs.
Kitten friendly??? Those are a good 5 inches
Am i the only one who dislikes Tamar??? She's so narcissistic.
I had been avoiding this video on my suggestions , but I'm glad I finally let it play
I love you Yamr and miss you on the Real ' when you left so did I
THIS NEW TAMAR IS GIVING ME LIFE💙💙💙💙
I thought black doesn't crack if she's 41 and then I'm 21 again get the f*** out of here
I am now a fan of Tamar Braxton, she is so funny and cool!!
Tamar's look is on point. Loving the hint of blue nail polish too.
Wow, I've never bought any of Tamar's albums, but I can listen and look at her all day lol
7:37 her face tho when Monica blocked her 😂😂😂
Instant like. Tamar I know its in the past, but loved you on the Real. Love her personality and sis is stunning here.
Ta Monster looks Amazing I love that picture with the wings
I wish she would stop lip-syncing her voice is way too beautiful to be lip-syncing like she does
Tamar keeps it real ✔people hate the truth 💯
That personality is one of a kind!!!
Tamar need to stop saying Toni married Byrd Man 😂
I love Tamar. My favorite track on the album is Hol' Up. Go listen, thank me later. xoxo!
Tamar is a super talent but if you ask me, it's more than obvious by the way she speaks that she developed nodules. This explains the lip synchs recently and the break from music. Speedy recovery :-) but stop the plastic surgery!
They need a show together asap
lol lol SMH lol HE (jehovah god) IS THE INSPIRATION NOT ME...
Great interview Tamar! You did that!!
You here for it?
I forgot how much I love Tamar Braxton personality. She need a show
because you know i'm that girl
Love the front of the album😍😍 gives me life!!
Shut up wendy and let her speak.
Yall I think Wendy went and got herself a real industry friend
I love me some Tamar she's very beautiful 😃😄
- I LOVE TAMAR, and I am so glad she is finding her own happiness! May God continue to bless you in your quest sis. ♥️♥️♥️♥️
She looks grotesque and cheap. She doesn't seem to feel good in her own skin. Sad for a 40year old women. Love yourself, at the end of the day that's the most important relationship in your life.
What I like about Tamar is that she learns from her mistakes and admits when she's wrong. She is always telling how she's working to certain things to be a better human being. And for that, I'll always wish her the best
Tamar has grown soooo much since we were reintroduced to her via Braxton Family Values. I love it.
She look like a punk
What ever happened to Toni Braxton??   Is this her stepford twin??
Gosh how can anyone not like Tamar???
I just love #Tamar Braxton so much!!! That's my girl!
She's finding herself. I enjoyed watching her today. She was Real
What happened to Toni? She is much prettier than her sister.
Tamar is starting to look like Lil Kim. Geez I love both women to bits but the surgery is too much! That nose has been redone too many times.
Tiny look like a midget in that picture lol
You stayed in atl knowing your husband got in a car accident???  Smh... I can't even finish watching this
🙏of healing for Ms. E
She is GLOWING hunny!! Always Love her spirit and her sense of humor! So happy that her and Terrell made up. 😍🙌🏾
Subscribe for a subscribe anyone ?
Why didn't she just fess up to liking Brandy's status then giving that lame as excuse of Vince doing it by mistake.. like C'mon Tay even Stevie Wonder can see the bs..OAN: she looks amazing for 40👌
I love me some Tamar!!!
I LOVE tamar.. OMG. she is so cool, and has an amazing personality.  #tarmartian
Tamar looks like Cher now... 😩😰\n\nSis is her new go to word. Lol! IDK but when Tamar isn't being obnoxious, she's hilarious.
Love Tamar
yaaaaaaaas that wig z giving me life....
Tamar 😴😴😴
Tamar making that Bird noise 😂😂😂...so epic!
She looks sooooo Good for 40
Tamar is SO funny

She seems optimistic.
i love her!!
Love you Tamar! ❤️
Love Tay Tay
Holy Botox...
I love Tamar
One of the best interviews. Love love love this. Love Tamar !
I adore Tamar. I know she is known to be the loud obnoxious Braxton lol, but I must admit she is one of my favorites.
Thought Steve Harvey was getting Tamar her own show. Hmm
why they do this to their face like omg they very not attractive..so sad
I love her. I stopped watching the real when she was fired. She's the one that made the show interesting
Luv U Tay Tay ❤️! What God has for you is for you, get it girl!!
I love love love  Tamar's personality!She needs her own talk show or reality tv show asap!
Tamar and Toni are vying for Jackson territory with the multiple nose jobs.  Now the noses are way too narrow and pointy.  Not a good look at all.\nThere is a pic of birdman kissing lil' wayne on the mouth.
wow Tamar is so beautiful as always 💕✨
Can Wendy get ready of those balloons in her chest? 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
SHE IS SOOO UNDERRATED . LOVE HER . glad she doing her thing 💙💯
Her stylist was sent from heaven
Good interview this is what growth look like 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾 Congratulations Tamar many blessing
I love Tamar! She is so funny.
I just love her!
Tamar is such a beautiful and funny woman. I love her..

I love the name Aprillll
Love you so much 💜 also I love Vienna, def putting that on my potential baby names list
Just for the record I've known about 4 people named Autumn and yes it is such a nice name!
My name was featured in this hahaha! Daisy is weird because it's kind of common but then again I don't actually know many other Daisy's. This is so funny as my dog is called Teddy Edward and I actually know a girl called Autumn with strawberry blonde hair! Such a coincidence. Love this video as always Gab and all of the names you have such a cool and different taste✨🌹
vienna is my #1 😭 a mum once called out to her gorgeous little daughter in the hairdresser saying “vienna” and i fell in love, it’s so beautiful
My nephews called Hudson and I definitely agree about it being American sounding but his brothers are called Lennon & Jaxon so they go well together
Sky is a beautifullll boys name but nobody has ever agreed with me😂 reminds me of mamma Mia aha
Oh my gosh Gabs you are glowing!! I want to come round to yours so you can do my makeup this beautiful haha ❤️
I love the boy name Clay 😊
Me and my cousin Isabella were able to choose my baby cousins name so we called her Gabriella Claudia! 💗
You remind me of poppy deyes so much 😮
Hi Gabbie I've got a great video idea for you I've snapped you it it's a pll tag and it's so fun and I'd love you to do it  it has so many questions that I'd love to know as Ik your a big pll fan like me xx ps Ly❤️❤️
My sister in law is called Isabel but everyone calls her Isa :)
I love my name too 😳😘
Your hair looks gorgeous, really suits you! Ps- what is on your eyes?😍
Oh hey 👋 I love my name too 😊
I’m in love with Willow atm as a girl now and Noah as a boy x
my names Daisy, well Daisy-May but it makes me feel like a baby
Im called Issy by most of my friends, haha
im arabic and my name is Nouf and everyone calls me Noufa
Hey Gabs! If you come to Austria I think you would LOVE Innsbruck, it's a city near Salzburg. 😘 amazing names btw!!
I don’t know why but I really like the name Cordelia...
I love the name autumn, I’ve always wanted a little girl named autumn, me and my boyfriend have agreed on having it after a hyphen with something else before it
My middle name is Daisy!x
YES VIENNA OH MY GOD (I live there sorry I'm so excited holy shit)
I agree so much about Isabella! also my cousins called Isabella so it’s off the cards lol
I just think of a Vauxhall nova which is the ugliest car 😂
I work at a preschool and there are two boys named Hudson and Bohdi! ❤️
I know someone called Autumn!!
Aww one of my best friends is called Liesel xxx
My sisters middle name is nova
Liesel sounds too much like weasel for me. But love all the other names you talked about! I too love the sound of music!
I have a niece named Izabella. We call her Bella
Also I hope this isn't too random, but I really think Desirae is such a nice name ^_^ xxxx
Love this video Gab!! At my work placement there is a girl called Autumn and she's so cute!! Loving the darker hair, it looks so good on you and it suits you so much, love you always!! Xx
Oh my god my childhood teddy was called Teddy Edward 😂😂😂
Love the names you love omg !! Sky is my favourite boy name, reminds me of Sophie’s fiancé in Mamma Mia the movie 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
My friends called autumn and her brother is called archer. Feel like you may have a similar asthetic to her mum 😁
im gonna guess that one of your top girls names is summer? idk
Your hair looks so healthy and shinny, woah!! I'm thinking of dying it darker as well, love it😍 Out of all the names you said in the video, I love Blair, Nova, Daisy and Vienna, I would probably use Vienna too!
my parents let me name my cat when I was 8 and I named him tedward 😂
Ok so when you said Monica I thought that Isabella would be a good first name with Monica in the middle... Then you mentioned Isabella literally five seconds later 😱
Omggg I’m called Viana but it’s pronounced Vienna 💗 love you soo much
I’ve got a nephew called teddy xx
Not even pregnant but I know that I'm calling my first daughter Skye
I'd love to know why you won't tell us your top three  I don't know why you won't tell us but I respect your decision anyway
Me and my brother both have four letter names because my parents didn't want us to have nicknames which hasn't worked 😂 Esme-Ezz and Toby-Tobs 😊
Hope your feeling better x
Love Autumn and Vienna ❤️ xx
I watch the sound of music with my nana, and we have bonded so much over that c
I absolutely adore the name Freddie for a girl 😍 my cousin has a friend called that and I think it's just gorgeous 😍😍
My surname is HUDSON!!!!!!!!x
nooo way!! i call my dog teddy edward x
My auntie is called Monica and her daughter is called Claudia 😘
I love the name Vienna but it's far too similar to my name❤️😭 ( Sienna)
i bloody love your dark hair! it suits you so much what the heck!!! love you xx
I love the French name Ninon so much but of course my sister decided to call her daughter Nina so my husband now doesn't like the fact that there will be a Nina and a Ninon in the family 😂 otherwise I love Stella and Emilia.
lol I hate it so much when people call me Izzy its such a rank nickname I don't mind Bella though
My sisters are called Claudia, Gabriella and I'm Isabella 😂❤
glad I'm not the only person who likes the name Autumn love it :)
Daisy here 🙋🏼 I feel like its such an old persons name hahah but glad ur a fan
It's actually spelled Bodhi, my nephew has this name x
Smokin make up 😍😍😍 can u do a tutorial of that pleaaassee 😭
My baby sister is called Bonnie! Xx
My name is Monica lol Xx
My mom’s called Claudia 😊
My gran was called Isabella, but she got called Sibell😊
Vienna has forever and always been my favourite name
I live in Austria near Salzburg. Actually I go to uni in Salzburg and I would love if you came to Austria and did some Vlogs😍
I have never met anybody that isn’t in my family that has watched the sound of music and it has also given me the love of Julie Andrews too xx
PLEASE DO A MEETUP IN VIENNA PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE OMG
My cat is called Griffin XD
It's so weird how you think you should have been born in Austria or Germany. I was born in Austria and wish I would have been born in England! :)
My top three names are:\nalysandra\navery \nlena
You should watch the show 'party of five', it's on Netflix. There are both a Claudia and a Griffin in it, but I actuelly think you'd like the show in general
my name is isabella, but everyone calls me bella :D\noh and i'm from vienna, so if you need any tourguide advice, just tell me :)
I love the name Winona because of the nickname Winnie, like Winnie the Pooh
I'm called Kate, but I noticed how you said you can't shorten it, and for me that's true however every single teacher decides to call me Katie and It annoys me sooo much x love u gabby
Two things: 1. You look gorgeous here. You always look gorgeous obviously but I am loving the eye look & your hair length. 2. Great idea for a video!! I've always had a long list of baby names on my phone...I mean I've had one since college which was like 8 years ago 😂😂. Thought I was the only single girl with a list of baby names haha. Ok a couple of my favorites for a girl are Nora and Holland. For a boy I love Rafe and Mac.
Can you do this makeup look? It’s so so pretty You look THE BOMB
“I was gonna call my cat Teddy, his name is Nelly, his proper full name is Penelope but now I call him Nelson....yeah”
Your hair looks so good, babes!! ❤️❤️❤️
& winter! Xx
Ahh Gab where is your jumper from 😍❤️
I knw 5 autum's
YOUR SO GORGEOUS GABBY OH MY
wheres your jumper from?
CANT WAIT UNTIL 1 MILLION X
Hahaha, I called my little pug Nova :p
loving your videos! x
You look so stunning!!😍🔥
You look amazing 😍
Lovely names 😍
I'm calling izzy lol
Greetings from Austria ❤️🙋🏼🇦🇹
Why would you make a baby name video if you aren’t having a baby! 🤦🏽‍♀️
You look so stunning in this gabbie! Xx
My favourite names are Manhattan, Brooklyn and Hudson!! Because I love New York and I would also pay homage to my grandparents in middles names, probably slate and may because they’re my granny and grandad nicknames
I always wanted to call my baby girl Ava, but my boyfriend's surname is Braun. So I can't.
My friends little girl is called Autumn! I love it so much! My daughter is called Willow Rose and I am so annoyed because its everywhere now but when I was pregnant,we had it picked out from about 10 weeks pregnant and it stuck aha
I got gastritis but it was because I skipped lunches or breakfasts allot in college to save money..
I see lord of the rings reference, I like.
Could've seen this before my test.
Super informative, well organized script with awesome animation! Great job keep it up!
DON'T TOUCH ME I'M ______

Battle of the five armies...Oh no here comes a dragon fruit i call smaug
Herbs are for the healing of the nation. Replace inorganic chemicals with natural herbs then maybe you'll live a few years longer. Herbs cure diseases and Rx Meds reduced your discomfort. It doesn't get rid of it. It's their way to make sure you keep coming back.  I get it though, everyone just wants to make money. Try a Bromide, it's good for your digestive system.  I make it myself. And happy to report that I haven't had any stomach discomfort for quite sometime. I was born with a sensitive digestive system. Everything and Anything would cause discomfort. If you want more info, hit me up.
Definitely gonna show my mom she has no idea why she has ulsers and now she will know!! Yay!! 🙂+😟

Anyone else learning this in health class right now?
Been watching this for 3 minutes. Can't watch anymore what causes it?
I actually had one and at  the time it open, which caused internal bleeding which lead to six months of isolation mixed with pancreatitis caused my transplanted kidney to fail after five years. ESRD came back and here I am 8 years still on dialysis waiting for transplant. :(
I have a question for future videos: How smart are dolphins?
Literally just learned this in first year biology!

Now i see where the slang or figurative speech something  You have guts came from... AMEYZINGG

This is not surprising since it's been known for 25 years.

Baffled how you mention the value of antibiotics, but not antibiotic resistance, which is one of the biggest threats humanity faces at the moment.
I always get this and it's definitely not fun at all... The injections, the skin tests, just basically the worst

Titanium dioxide is put in many foods and it will end up in your stomach, these nano particles will act as Trojan Horse that will let bacteria penetrate your stomach lining with ease. I remember using chewing gum after every meal and always having very painful stomach problems, now I know that all chewing gums are full of Titanium nano particles.
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
nice  and Informative video :-)
That don't sound right I ate a lot of spicy food and greasy foods and I developed ulcers because of that, the doctor confirmed it.
Believe me stomach diseases are more dangerous than some life threatening diseases. I have been suffering from IBS-C for last 10 years and at every point of my life it reminds me that I am badly sick. Stress is definitely one of the causes of developing these problems and the issue is that when you have IBS it brings stress with it even if you're doing well in your life it keeps you stressed hence it aggravates the symptoms and this cycle continues. IBS causes stress and stress causes IBS. The worse thing is that there is no cure for IBS in the medical world in 21st century.
You know you have balls of steel when you experiment on yourself. Wowza!
i got rid of my h pylori after 4 years
loved those awkwardly silent solid couple seconds of nothing but fish floating in acid
That abdominal pain is no joke my peeps, if youre suffering from Ulcers I highly recommend you seek help and get treated for it.
This video shows why we should not disregard those scientists who express doubt about Global Warming.  In this medical instance, two lone doctors turned out to be correct when the vast majority of their peers felt confident that those two doctors were clearly wrong to doubt the majority opinion on ulcers.  A new, correct, correct idea is usually discovered by just one or two maverick researchers, and it can take years before the majority of scientists come to accept that new idea.
We all know that ulcers are caused by pregnant ex girlfriends.
healthy Breakfast a day, keeps the ulcers in jail.
Moral lesson: We should legalize human experiments so that the valuable people won't have to suffer.

Apple vinegar can kill this bacteria in 40 days if you add 2 spoons in a glass with hot watter and drink it on empty stomach! Many people didnt get cured even with antibiotic it is havy to cure... http://www.grocare.com/blog/tag/h-pylori-natural-treatment-apple-cider-vinegar/
Medicine kills and no such thing as infectious disease. Antoine Bechamps terrain theory not pasteurization.
Did anyone Noticed in the Animation Barry and his associate was doing Bhangra after recieving Nobel Prize.
4:34 and was the joint pain killers helping the h-pylori? or was it a symptom of h-pylori infection?\n\n\n\n\nbecause i searched for relations between h-pylori and joint pain killers ans what showed up was that joint pains may sometimes be a symptom of h-pylori infection...
The animations is becoming better and better
I had an ulcer when I was 15. I know it isn't pain medication because I didn't use to take it. Is this quite young?
Can ulcer be cured permanently? My friend have this I'm worried about her.
THESE ANIMATIONS WERE SO NICE .
exactly what i wanted to know
I still don't get how we got those bacteria? Which of our activities make the bacteria causes the pain? How to actually avoid getting ulcers in related to this knowledge?
Thanks to Dr. Marshall ❤🙌👍👏
Didn’t explain how h pyloral, causes stomach ulcers, I’m not a a scientist or even a college graduate, but maybe the antibiotics stop inflammation, not stomach ulcers.
This is a great information for me having ulcer and awareness for others. It is really bothers me when  Im having a severe stomach ache and vomit then people say it is due to that I dont eat.
Who or what ..exactly ..can you NOT STOMACH at this point in your life?..\nBecause ..there's zero wrong with your actual stomach ...\nPay attention to your mind\n..because ..ur thoughts\n are creating ..\nhow sik u are.
I wish there was a cure for Crohn's
With raw vegan pro-biotic food,you can grow good bacteria,to defeat bad one.
I don't have medical studies, but I know that if I don't eat good and at time(meaning 1 or 2 days without eating) I have a risk to get stomach diseases
More point should have been made about requiring surgery.  It was probably the post-surgical antibiotics that were curing it, not the proceedure.
scientific progress in medicine is unfortunately very slow. we care cure only very small portion of illnesses

It would have been nice if you would have said what specific antibiotic helps treatment of ulcers as I have them.That would have helped but good video
My doctor literally told me I had ulcers because of strees like three months ago, lol.\nI take a lot of pain medicine so that could be it.
Please do one on Rheumatoid Arthritis.
I get stomach ulcers when I hear progressives spew words out of their mouths.
Did I Enjoy it??.. I am Suffering from it.. I owe soooooo much to that doctor.. Still ain't cured but I'm getting there
Had 2 bleeding ulcers that were right on an artery earlier this year that required 2 emergency surgeries and was negative for H pilory. \nTurns out my great grandfather died from bleeding ulcers, my grandfather had ulcers and then I had these ulcers at the same age. \nWhile this is completely anecdotal it shows a genetic predisposition for my family and was able to give my doctors a look at a possibility of what otherwise seemed unheard of for my age.
Tbh it is the HCl that damages the mucosa of the stomach, leading to the ulcer. H pylori just messes with the stomach's pH detection so gastric juice secretions aren't turned off. That's why you prescribe triple therapy: two antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor to inhibit gastric juice secretion.\n\nAlso, H pylori is a common cause of *duodenal* ulcers (firstmost section of the small intestine). Gastric ulcers are less likely to be caused by H pylori alone; it is usually a combination of H pylori infection AND overuse of a class of painkiller called non-steroidal antiflammatories, such as aspirin and ibuprofen. With gastric ulcers, the infection needs to be all over the stomach but for duodenal ulcers only in the bottom-most region, closest to the duodenum (called the pylorus). The stomach-wide infection combined with inflammation (exacerbated by NSAID overuse, which inhibits prostaglandin as mentioned as a protective mechanism in the video) leads to gastric ulcers. Interestingly, if you have a duodenal ulcer, you are protected from gastric cancer, but more likely to get oesophageal cancer after treatment. Gastric ulcers can lead to gastric cancer and need to be closely monitored.

I love how she didn't express the fact that she thinks they're alike in negative way. She ''praised'' both songs and didn't pit one woman against each other. I gotta admit I didn't expect that answer but I loved it. Way to go Fergie!
I love a three way 🤣🤣👏🏽🤦🏽‍♂️
FERGIE is unbothered I love her.
The song actually borrows from I'm Too Sexy.
nice way to dodge directly answering that question
Ok why andy feel the need to bring up Taylorswift in every interview?
If it was Taylor she would be sueing to the godss
Andy: I love a threeway ... so casual.
I also love a threeway
Andy says, I love a 3-way. LMAO!!! I bet he does.
wow she looks so gorgeous
I love her!
It amazes me how Taylor has so many people hooked on her with such mediocre vocals and basic songs.
So both songs are shite, gotcha.
They were probably written by the same person.
Most pop songs sound the same to make sure it speaks to the mass/mainstream and sell for millions
It's like those vines where the guy's like oh is it the part that goes OHWAOooHAaaWAAAAOHWAAH?
Fergie is an amazing live singer
I really like how nice and positive she is. ALSO WHEN SHE STARTED SINGING? Slay!
Sounds nothing like Taylor's song. She just want attention and views lol
Did anyone else freak out when she started singing? Such a pure voice! Love you Fergie!
oh fergie you pig just shut your mouth and go back to the drawing board
What! The chorus for Taylor's song had the best sampled from Too Sexy For My Shirt song, so I am confused why Fergie name is in the same mix.
Does anybody else cringe when people start singin like that?
I love it i love a threeway. I bet you do you creeper lmao
As they used to say in the olden days Fergie's got CLASS.\nI said it right away about it sound like Fergie and the Black Eyed Peas
I love a threeway? I bet the only threeway he had was with his dog and his TV remote control
Fergie threw no shade I love her
They probably share the same songwriter that's why.
We all love 3 ways!
Yeah, they are both shit.
There are only so many combinations of music. Silly pricks trying to cause some drama.
Why would she care that it sounds the same, the chorus of the new Taylor Swift song is shit, monotone, repetitive and boring and with that being the case it says a lot about the chorus of her song.
You know what? Fair play to her! I dont like Fergie i never have (except for the first 2 Black Eyes Peas albums and even then i didnt exactly LIKE her) but ive got a lot of respect after seeing this! She easily could have gone in for an attack on Taylor and point out how she sues everyone she can think of for the most pathetic and minor of similarities (she tried trademarking 'haters gonna hate' ffs a saying older than her and she wants to own it) but nope she kept a cool head and proved shes a better person than me 😂
I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought that new Taylor swift song was meant for fergie
That's a great answer to that question
Isn't she a mother of a child? Hmmmmm. Great goals!
Its true after hearing Taylor Swifts new song i thought she'd joined the Black Eyed Peas lol
I thought the song sounded like Boom Boom Pow rather than My Humps.
Where is the love?......remember that deep song....what happened? Do they have charities helping others?
Well they both took it from right said Fred - I’m to sexy.
First time I heard it I thought it was very Fergie!
Of course they sound the same. Their music is all written by the same guy.
Nobody claps or whoops after she sung..burn!
i love a threeway
Both shit
I love a threeway! Lmao Andy
They are both shite performers anyway.
Clever reply, classy lady.
Taylor is cancer
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dTZ5phVyvAw
👌 attitude. Classy lady!
Haha ......... Silance             😂
So they're both shit artists ahhh I get you
first time I heard Taylor's song I was like this is so fergie humps
Stop using Botox
What a legend
I would suck the farts out of her baking bowl.
Irrelevant
Taylor Swift is a tranny. I was shocked when I found out the truth.
poor thug

Lorde sounds like she's trying to sing in the style of Christopher Walken.
I like Lorde. Royals. Tennis court. Great songs. But man, she butchered Phil Collins here :-(
Not for me, good artist but this didn't work.
Why do they all have to wear headphones?
2:57 Reminds me of the Bridesmaids' Wilson Phillips scene
I can feel it ... comin in the air the night ...
Isn't this Kent to be stans dad
Is it bad that I like this more than the original ???
Why does it sound like she is saying “the night” instead of “tonight”?
Such a nice voice, but what a boring song/cover >__<
I can phil it coming in the air tonight oh lorde
Love you normally, but this doesn't work
Lorde is a great artist, but not a good singer.
I just came here because of Eminem's song Stan
Great voice but not for this song !!
Well, she fucked that justice up to a great song right from the get-go.
I thought that was fine.
I love lorde but this was rough. She was out of key several times and it's just not her style at all. 5/10.
I saw Lorde perform this on Wednesday night at Ally Pally and it was amazing- i think it had more impact live and with a more powerful backing instrumental.
watched her perform at Alexandra Palace, and that version was definitely loud drums, so much energy and full sounds! I think this version is paired down from the original
Oh no baby what is you doing
and the boots to match !
this is her style, it's how she expresses herself. to compare it to the original is silly because they're two completely different artists
This is awful.  I love the original song and the cover by nonpoint.  Not this version though, even though I like most of Lorde's music.  This seemed very empty and never got moving.  Querky, odd, nothingness.
In the air tonight, not in the air the night
2:59
Meh
Was Joe Cocker her Grandpa?
Worst cover ever wtf sounds fucken terrible! Haha she looks like an alien getting electrocuted!
Sounds like shes tryin to do a shit.\nU people r fuckin deliousonal
This is literal shit
underwhelming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnzFRV1LwIo
NO just NO
Rubbishhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Voice is overatedddddddddddddd. Oh lordeeeeeee.
Oh, Lord, 3:40 gives me chills
FUCKING TRASH!!!!
My reaction:  OH LORDE!!
No. Just no.
Oh lord...so off key
HER PARENTS MUST BE RETARTED COZ SHES SOMETHING SPECIAL
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
OH. MY. FUCKING. GOD.
Give up girl
Stan Smith can really sing.
That stranger bitch :v
quel désastre
Well that was shithouse
greatness
This was terrible.
Big fans of Phil Collins and 80s soft rock will not like this version, but this is in the style of 2000s alternative pop. I like it ... a lot.
Like a possessed woman in a strait jacket. Great version !
I like Lorde, and don’t even dislike this cover, but it is a little off. It’s REALLY hard song to cover successfully.
In the LOVE tonight (with this cover)
Lorde your dad just rang. He wants his shirt back.
I couldnt finish it.  Im not a fan of her voice.  Not saying shes a bad singer but I dont like hearing her voice.  My opinion.
mike tyson was right..... the drums part is the best part by far
I got to see her at All Palli the other night and she performed this, it was so amazing
I love Lorde but wtf is this.
Missed the deep drums like the heart a little earlier in song wudbe great
This song is really hard to sing. You need a good voice to sing it. Collins has an under appreciated good voice.
If it had a sax and a lush trumpet it'd be perfect
This was so amazing in concert
Is this a parody of south parks parody of herself ? I mean srsly you guys.. lorde lorde lorde, ai am lorde, lorde lorde lorde
This sucks, DMX did this song more justice than this...
She performed this at the Manchester show that I was at and it was AMAZING
Oh my god this is so bad.... I like Lorde, and this is one of my favorite songs ever, but she bombed. She’s trying wayyyyy too hard, her technique on her Pure Heroin album was so much better and would have suited this cover a lot better. God her technique is awful here.
Well, this is awful!
The waiting for the drums to kick in was way too fucking intense. She knew that's what we were all waiting for 😭
Her voice, is so... grating? Not a fan of this one.
She sang it in the concert two days ago!!!!
ooooh, it was so amazing ! great version, thank you, lorde
i love lorde but this is kind of weak, the light synth music doesnt help it by ripping the power from the song completely. I recommend listening to buzzcut season live on instead of this. People are hyping it which will turn off people that may never have heard her before and thinking this is a good representation of her talent.
I got some XX vibes from the guitar
This generation is so full of overly auto tuned synthesized bullshit and she came in at the right time and was like I GOT YOU. LISTEN TO MY LEGIT ASS REAL AUTHENTIC VOICE. She’s exactly what music needed recently. She’s incredible.
I love this song so much 😭!!!!
ok lorde i see you  go off sis
This is what i really need rn. God Bless you my queen Lorde.
Worst cover ive ever heard
I feel like evertime Lorde sings someone else's song, it's like it's her own. Not like the original one isn't good or anything, but just like there's that thing in the way she does it. Impressive.
amazing!! i love her voice
Fucking awful
Not good :(
Uuuh stay in time...jeez
This makes me uncomfortable...
terrible version- like pure shit
WTF How bad She sing omg my ears
i felt bjork vibes in this
yesyesyesyesyes ......yes
YES!
Ya Ya Ya
The keyboard is out of tune as much as the vocals. #notphillinit
Well.... that was a bit disappointing
This is so weak.
Well, all the morons seem to like it.
TRAINWRECK
Absolute shit
Terrible
OH SHITE
Shit cunt
Jamie! When you use baby facial for the first few times mix 2 pumps of the facial with 2 pumps of the oil. It adds extra hydration to the peel and makes it more balancing and your skin will be super soft. It also makes it a little more comfortable too. I'm obsessed with it and actually use it 2x a week religiously, but I had to work up to that. \nAlso, you just don't want to use anything with AHA/BHA/retinol/enzymes immediately after washing Baby Facial off. But surrounding days you def can. DE also recommends using the Marula oil after rinsing baby facial. \nI would do baby facial on Sunday, TLC 1-2x a week and maybe rotate in moonfruit 1-3x a week. I'm a Skin Lead at Sephora and highly recommend all the things you bought 😊
Hello

I arrived back from New York this morning for the for the first time in america! I spent $800 in Sephora 🙈😂 I was like a kid at Christmas 😂😂 I’m now bankrupt!! X
How many did u roughly spend all together
For those of you who are old enough to remember, there used to be a Sephora on Oxford Street, London years ago but closed down. There are talks one will be opening in Westfield East London soon, shame it won't be in Central London like Covent Garden which is like Beauty Central. Whoop x
We need a tutorial on this eye look please Jamie, you look bloody gorgeous girl 😘
Are you going to review the new kat von d palette???
You said it rite the first time is said bosha and the feet mask is amaze balls it works very very well!
Hey guys! Hope you're having a great day. I make videos about food and it would mean the world to me if you gave my channel a looking, lemme know what you think. Much love!
I live in the Netherlands and there's also no Sephora here! Seriously, Sephora step up your game and come to more European countries!!
Please do a first impressions/testing of that foot mask!!!
Hi Jamie, what product do you use to bring out your freckle? Thank you! You’re ace. 😘
It was not cheap but it was the last one, which make me think it was super necessary 😂😂😂 Thats so me.
Totally agree bring Sephora to the UK
You're camera quality is off the chain. Great vid, J. Thank you.
Tutorial on this look please, omg its amazing
A good dupe for the drunk elephant baby facial is the body shop drops of youth liquid peel. Does exactly the same thing but is only £18. So gross but so satisfying at the same time !
am I the only one who got ASMR from 15:43
Girl when I was in New York I was spending thousands! I git to VIB Rouge status in a week 🙈😂
WE NEED SEPHORA IN THE UK😭😭
Jamie you can use the drunk elephant baby facial and the tlc framboos at the same time just not on the same day so use the baby facial on Monday and then the rest of the week use the tlc framboos (I work at Sephora)
Please do a tutorial on applying lashes 💖💖💖
That Baby Soft Foot Mask is CRA CRAAAAA! Your skin peels off!!

Please do a tutorial on this eye look!
I wish you could come to New Mexico and do my makeup for my husbands return from deployment! You are so incredibly stunning & talented!
Ugh so jealous of this haul 😭 if you just use the Sukari Facial every 1.5-2 weeks, you can still use the DE night serum or other AHA products in conjunction with it! You just need to make sure you stay away from actives 3-4 days before you use the Babyfacial. Just listen to your skin, if you are over exfoliating it will let you know!!
Ugh I want to try all this stuff! I need more money 😩
can you do this make up look in a video plz
wish i could buy all this ughh hahaha
Omg Jamie, please do a tutorial/review on the rubber mask!!❤️
I live for your vlogs, and the hauls are always amazing too! Hope your jet lag wears off before your next trip!

Yay yay yay! So happy a bigger YouTuber talked about Farmacy! I absolutely love that brand especially sleep tight and the honey potion moisturizer
please do a makeup collection x
Hey Jamie! Are you going to be dropping your teeth transformation video? Lots of love xM
Can you do a night time routine :)
hi Jamie!! I've seen you own the simple Human mirror...Do you like it for everyday make up?? I need one  and I would love to know your opinion!!\nthanks love, kisses from Spain
I think you can use the glycolic acid and the facial at the same time-- just not the same day. So, once your skin is used to it, I think you could use a schedule like this: TLC S-T-Th, facial F, rest Sat. (Although since they're both heavy AHA's that might be a lot of the same acid to put on your face... but you *could* is what I'm saying.) I do a similar schedule with lactic acid and a mandelic peel respectively, and my very chronically sensitive skin loves it.
Love you Jaime !!! Love that eye look, it's so beautiful!
I've become such a huge fan of yours . Everything about you is so real and classy . Your skills are insane and completely beautiful #girlcrushjng
Drunk elephant is such an amazing brand! For video ideas I still love the full face looks that you do, especailly when they're extra long. I'd love to see a classic bronze smokey eye from you. Those are my favourites to watch because everyone looks good in them
Please film the foot mask thing!
Could we have a tutorial on your eye look?? I love the green and wud love to know WHICH shadows you used 😃❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
A fat stack of face masks 😂😂😂
I love getting your opinion on beauty products! Loved it xx
Her my face on her thumbnail made me click on it 😂😂😂like 😰
Jamie can you PLEASE do a review on the new Huda Beauty eyeshadow palette? I have seen so much controversy over it and I really trust and respect your opinions and honesty when reviewing products. Thanks love you xx
Your face in the thumbnail #canrelate 👌🏽
I remember when I was a kid and we had Sephora in the Uk- In London in Angel and Brent Cross. I guess they weren’t so successful at the time, but it was before blogging and YouTube ect really took off
Hey Jamie, would you be so kind as to do a basic gentle skin care routine from start to finish for newbies in this beauty world? :)
I love the Drunk Elephant Glycolic Serum, my skin has been so much better since I used it.
please do a vid about round eyes and a green eye makeup look. Also my eyeliner used to be perfect and its no longer awesome so a an eyeliner look where you really delve into semi-hooded eyes would be helpful. also please do a video on night skin care! love you Jamie! your the shit! I gather so much inspiration
I thought that said “Noon Fruit” hahahahaha
What eyelashes are you wearing in this vid? 😍😍
Wow your videos are blowwwing up lol I love it! I like the haul vids, for sure! Keep doing them! Could you do an updated brow routine (+ any tips with eyebrows that don't grow symmetrically, or up in the center? Weird but I can't figure it out and I just want your brows :( \n\nWould also love to see a NAF trip vlog! Always dope. \n\n+ your routine touch ups at your favorite place :)))) 👄
Please do a makeup tutorial on your Vegas make up look and your dark eye when you were on the plane the 2nd time!!
Can u do a tutorial on this look?? 😍❤️
I love it when you do hauls because it's on skin care!! Not so many gurus do this (or at least the ones I've seen), and it's so important to have a good bra and knickers for the face before makeup; so thank you. \n\nAlso, can we just talk about this GAWWWWWGEEEEEEUS eye makeup??!?!?!! GURL. YOU KILLING ME.
You makeup looks soooo good ! \nI definitely want to try those Sephora mask and the watermelon mask
you should look into The Body Shop skincare products! My brothers girlfriend works at one and she's been hooking me up with samples, and everything i've tried is to die for! I think you'd really love their face/hair masks, and the drops of youth oil/oils of life. I use the drops of use which have more of an aloe vera texture as a primer base, and the oils of laugh as your signature i'm crying! drops onto my face to help blend and add some extra glow to my face when putting on foundation. ☺️💕🌻
Hi lovley🙋🏻 could you maybe do a skincare routine? Would love to see these products in action ❤️💋
I love this lip colour you’re rocking! Nudes for life xx
i've been using the drunk elephant products for a while now and i love them but don't accidentally get them in your mouth because they taste like shit
The Deunk Elephant TLC serum seriously SAVED my skin. Highly recommend. I have dry, sensitive, acne prone skin.
There is a Sephora in London xx
Hey Jamie, the little spoon comes with the watermelon glow mask. 😊
Please do that charcoal peel off mask in a video
I wish drunk elephant was just a smidge cheaper. I've heard such great things about their products!!
#bringsephoratoscotland I'm from Scotland I know how it feels ! 😂
For UK people who can’t get sephora - the body shop do an amazing dupe for the drunk elephant baby facial! the vitamin C glow revealing liquid peel 🤓 you use it in the same way and it makes all your dead skin cells ball up and come off when you rinse it. it’s only £18 too, i swear by it 🙊
Did sephora GIVE YOU a gift card to use for this purchase? case that makes all the difference.
What are you wearing on your lips, it's gorgeous! Also, love that eye look!
Kiss\nI would like to see you guys kiss.\nIt could be the purpose\nI don't mean you're right for each other I just want to see you kiss\nKISS\n\nThis is so relatable 😂
“tell me what you go do with all his ass” - Scott Hoying to Mitch Grassi 2017
Why do I think it is cute when Mitch hits Scott?  I should be appalled, but instead I laugh every time!
#20 ON TRENDING YESS
The album is amazing! Congratulations ❤️
i was hoping the names would be like \n“my name is horse”\n“my name is cowboy and i’m gonna ride you”
You're trending on YT and Im a proud momma!
God she is funny
All of the shirts that Mitch wears, I want
SCOTT DID THE FALLING ASLEEP THING AGAIN AHHHHHAHAHAHAHA
i love these music videos SO much, but I'm excited for sit down videos like this again, you guys are killing it with balancing them though and its insane how far this channel has come in such a short time:)
Only 90’s kids will remember the time when this was called ‘HURRY UP BLOOPERS?’
When Scott said One Piece I was secretly hoping that Mitch would say Cowboy Bebop because of his shirt 😅
i love mitch's hair like this
They’ve been\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCelebrating?\no-o \nO-o\nO-O
4:18 wouldn't we all
Lmao I've been born and raised here in Hawaii so when Scott pronounced poke bowls the first time I cringed SO MUCH lol but I'm just happy that he is eating Hawaiian foooodd
I’m so proud of y’all!!! Like I listen to talks music on REPEAT but I’m so happy y’all like poke and true blood because they are literally the best
My song of the week is Mitch's song of the week
How am I just now realizing how much they look like Mitch and Greg from ASAPscience. like BRO the similarities are AMAZINGGGG.
Omg when Mitch throws the imaginary Pokéball at 6:50 I just died.
listen you better GO IN on the true blood and get yo LIFE WITH LAFAYATTE!!!!!
Wonderful video guys !!! I’m so proud! Congrats on the future friends album ranking so high ! ILY
Yes she ships them too and shit
Omg that was so funny I cried.ILYSM
I AM LIVING FOR EVERYTHING SUPERFRUIT RIGHT NOW
FIRST, AMAZING 😍 SECOND, YES WE GOT OUR  WEEKLY OBSESSION AND SONG OF THE WEEK 😻😻😻
I just want to watch you two kiss Kiss... me! If that aint me and the rest of the fandom idk what is
mitch looks so hot, love a guy that can pull off a stache
yay I have something in common with Mitch,True Blood is one of my favorite shows
I love how Mitch's style/look is always evolving!!
im so proud of you guys and i love you sooo much and this was sooooooo funny to watch
I THOUGHT MITCH WILL SAY YURI ON ICE kaajhqowhwosjdbdlosiahdldjslahdxjbxxlajshdospwjdwowjdhd
I like how they programmed JANET this time. (where are the good place fans at?!?)
D’arcy.... What a QUEEN!!!!
Tell me what you're going to do with all of this ass.\n_Same_
Wait I used to watch u hmmmm WAIT ARENT YOU FROM PENATONIX I used to watch u in like 2nd grade now I’m in 5th wow
You two r so sweet I love u!!
No no my sign is leo not exactly what Mitch said but when he said that i died.
I missed these kind of videos
Mitch ! I really love your two blocks cut♡♡♡
4:18 to 4:39 is me but also id be like i don't mean you're right for each other, but I mean I do. you are literally a perfect couple *awkwardly looks down while awkwardly laughing
slowly getting used to the mustache...
I am really surprised that you all reacted positively to the kind of remarks her character made in fun. They are exactly the kind of rude remarks that Mitch has said she doesn't understand why people are rude and mean. I did not like the character that D'Arcy Carden portrayed. She was a complete turn off for me. The song was great and I loved the dancers and Mitch's and Scott's keeping up with the choreography, and acting reactions during the song. The It's 4AM line didn't work with the lighting in the song. . . .  The abrupt No I can't from Mitch and then you both walking away from each other---was sad to me.  I would have liked something like  aaaa better not. That's not what we tried this for. . . Come on let's go then leave together. \nOf course, I would have l LOVED a kiss, but I know we won't get many. We just waited years for the one in the live cast. Hugs :-) BKK
WHEN MITCH PRETENDED TO THROW A POKE BALL I FUCKING DIIIEDD
I was literally watching the good place right before this.
this is all I look forward to in life
how dose it fell to be 20 on trending lol
Why did Scott say tell me what to do with all that ass like a Chem teacher that would stick her head in the fume hood to get a closer look then pass out....?
Oh my god I'm living for Mitch's mustache! 😂 he looks just like his dad
I'm so proud of y'all oml
lol it's like she has drew monson's humor
I LOVE YOUR SONG CALLED GUY.AVI
I love this video and them but Mitch missed a perfect opportunity when Scott said My name is One Piece to say My name is Cowboy Bebop lol cowboy is even on his shirt
Thank you so much for the music. So good! Can't stop listening. New fav band!!! All the love. All the luck.
WHERE'S DENY U? GOODBYE FROM LONELY??
Am I the only one who thought he meant the manga/anime One Piece when Scott said his name 😂
I missed you so much!!! ❤️
1:33 put that audio inside a stuffed bear because that's the cutest two seconds I've ever heard in my life
Janet! :D The whole exchange with you guys and her was fantastic. I was laughing the whole time. XD
Favorite part: when she fondles Scott's chest 😂 because, same, girl, same.
Mitch+Scott=♡?

Kumail Nanjiani has now earned the title of unfuckwithable.
That last one was so funny
Last one was savage
I TOTALLY agree with the ventriloquist one! My goodness!! If they were to make an X-rated Pinocchio movie, Jim Parsons the guy
Michael Keaton response was pretty funny.  Last one was hilariously funny.
Jennifer Lawrence is my spirit animal
cut animal sector fun alien english chamber.
The last one should be a rapper
Is Jenifer Aniston still a thing. About time that career was put to retirement.
every shade of your mothers lipstick Oh god what a Savage
Jake Gyllenhaal has the most HANDSOME face of all time. I would like nothing more than to KISS him in his FURRY, soft, starry-eyed pug face. WOOF!
Every shade of your mom's lipstick 50 Shades of Red
This wasn't funny at all
My feminist sister at UC Berkeley who attends seminars about female empowerment and teaches gender and sexual equality doesn't like Gadot because she's Israeli. My sister knows she's Israeli and uses this as the defining factor. Like, isn't that racist? And guilt by association to the crimes and reputation of Israel?
I'd punch Jake Gyllenhaal in the face with my lady parts.
I was dying at Jim Parsons 😂😂😂😂😂
THE LAST ONE SKSKKS
I loved jenifer Lawrences xD how did they know
Tbh Jim pardon does look like that.
I lost at bag of flour and Jim Parson's one... LMAO
That indian guy is a legend
Michael Keanton look at the end is terrifying!
The Gwyneth Paltrow one had me in stitches!! 😂😂😂

Hahaha. I'll buy the last one ☝️. So adorable
These were funny before they tried to slip In Politics
that last one: I AM ROLLING. so funny!!!!!!!!
Now that you mention it, Jake Gyllenhaal does have an oddly punchable face. Sorry Jake.
that last one was so savage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I only clicked for that hot chick in the thumbnail that looks like Wonder Woman :)
Most of these aren't actually funny, but just sexually offensive. Is this the only humour people can pull off ?
Is there somebody who can tell me who the first woman is ?thankyou😂
that jim parsons one though
Those reaction of celebrites is priceless. 😂
just here for Jake
Burrrrrrn on the last one from Kumal!
This woman is good looking but has no ass...
Yeesss I love these ones there hilarious
The last one was SAVAGE ASF I live for that clap-back
The last one was straight savage 😂😂😂😂
Alec Baldwin and Jaime Lannister were the best ones I thought. The person didn't even know Jaime's real name lmao. It's Nikolaj Coster-Waldau btw.
I PEED MYSELF ON THE LAST ONE
The last one had me shook.
GOD DAMN THE LAST GOT ME SHOOK!
i didn't get the Aniston one, can someone explain it to me?
I love these so much!
I agree with the Gwyneth's one, I didn't get Jennifer Aniston's, and my favorite response was Kumail's.
I wonder how long it took them to find a mean tweet about gal gadot that wasn't about her being a Zionist 🙄
I felt so bad for Jim when he read the last few words of his DX
That person had the OG @Ida twitter handle and the account was suspended smh
How do they know?
OMG!!!... Kumail Nanjiani's come back was SO GOOD AND EPICLLY QUICK WITTED he should be awarded an Emmy just for that alone!!!... 😂😂😂 That dude is Truly a Comedic Genius!!! 🙌🙇🙌🙇

I can't say no to you, James.
Pass the blunt you fat orange fuck
Que musica ruim :(  que pena. James Blunt é top. Mas essa musica é ruim
Linda música! Como todas de sua brilhante carreira, esta toca de forma profunda ao coração por falar de um amor impossível nesta vida. Nos emociona demais . geny Martins.

any filipinos listening or am i the only one? (:
J aime beaucoup cette chanson. Pour moi c'est la plus belle de l'album. Très beau clip Merci James
weird video ... you have to explain it to me. really!
Why on the earth two videos for a song?
Love James since elementary school. His voice and music are both great.
Love this video, which tells a deeper story, and it is so so tragic.    😭😭😭\n\nJames Blunt is a pure artist.  Every song is genuine and from the heart.
I loooove this song....not all songs, James is the best
Love it -  I love your music Mr Blunt <3
The lyrics though... they speak to me!! ❤
my favourite song in The After love
please come to Ecuador again >:(
Great song. My favorite. James is the best.
I'm confused why does the song has tow videos!!
For a moment there i though that this was the preview story of if time is all i have, amazing video <3 last part gave me chills
I was thinking dis' video could be more... dramatic// I mean, 4 da' lyrics, but good job 4 a very great song // this song remember me my situation: I love it but... I hate it
Elisangela, \nSul real, '?
The little girl is my cousin
This song is the only good in this album. Sorry James, but your last album is so different.
Video gave me a whole new perspective at the song.
We still got some good Singers
Wow, James Blunt you’re so amazing and hopefully someone will do Remix soon could be great
Hope is the worst motherfucker out of Pandora's can.
love the song! love from Kazakhstan
This is FANTASTIC, Blunty. There’s a reason why this is one of my favorite songs on The Afterlove.
Please make a video for Paradise
*Before my 100th birthday,* I need to find me some me-time to go and see him in concert.\n-\n*There is just no one like him!*  (I love James Blunt!)
God bless your voice man!  love your songs!
I think I'd like to listen to his voice for the whole of my life ❤️
OmgI swear that I've cried. Stop to kill yourself in your videos!!
Who else was amazed by the aestehtic and got aboslutely shocked at the and when the car crash happens? goddamn now I'm crying.
I've been learning how to sing most all your music perfectly but this song with the auto tune now I cant =/

Now actually, this is a real good number!
Oh Come On, James! Playing the death card again? I like you anyway. Love from Buenos Aires.
James Blunt, One of the most underrated singers of this time and 'Don't Give Me those Eyes' is probably one of the best songs of 2017

The title works. Especially with how many times I've played the song from start//end :)
Weird to him like actually singing in his videos, amazing
LYRICS:-\n\nYou try to kill it but it won't stop bleeding\nTry to forget it but it won't stop killing you\nYou're running out of time\nYeah, you know you can't go back\nIt's too late\nTo say it's too late\nYou can't take back that you said nothing\nHow could you do nothing?\n\n\nIs this burning right?\nAm I living bridges?\nCan we build our past right?\nLearning through future solecism\n\n\nIt's played out (I've missed times)\nI've moved on (been disconnected)\nGet fucked up (I stressed time)\nMy new draw (forgetting timing)\nAnd it's not right (and I need you to talk me down)\nYou're dead wrong\nWhat are we doing? ('cause I feel like I need to crash)\nLet's go home\nThere's no hope\nIt's all wrong\n\n\n'Cause I've been looking at the sky to show me where I went wrong\nBeen looking at the sky like someone was looking down\nBut it keeps raining on me\nAnd I've been looking at the sky since I was like 5 years old\nBeen looking for the stars but it seems like they're all gone\nAnd the fault's not ours alone\nBut I think it's time to go\n\nIt's played out\nI've moved on\nGet fucked up\nMy new draw\nAnd it's not right\nYou're dead wrong\nWhat are we doing?\nLet's go home\nThere's no hope\nIt's all wrong\n\nAnd I've got way too many questions just to try and get it right\n'Cause I can't be the one to shrug it off\nAnd I could be the reason that we stay up all night\nTo be someone, to be someone\nAnd oh, all we've got is to try to get it right\nBut no one told you\nThat this gon' hurt, oh no\nAnd now all I really want is to scream\nNow all I really want is to scream\nNow all I really want is to scream\nNow all I really want is to scream\n\n\nThat shit just to try and find a way to get my head down\nAnd head out or maybe just the two of us and head now\nI'm just tryna find the real now\nDream clouds, ghost ground\nReal friends, dead hometown\n\n'Cause I've been looking at the sky to show me where I went wrong\nBeen looking at the sky like someone was looking down\nBut it keeps raining on me\nAnd I've been looking at the sky since I was like 5 years old\nBeen looking for the stars but it seems like they're all gone\nAnd it breaks my heart, you know\nBut I think it's time to go\n\n\nIt's played out\nI've moved on\nGet fucked up\nMy new draw\nAnd it's not right\nYou're dead wrong\nWhat are we doing?\nLet's go home\nThere's no hope\nIt's all wrong
I can't believe, you finally released a new song !!!! :D
Hey, I love you, and I know it isn't always easy. But you should upload more <3.
I feel like this would play in a slowmo tage at the end of a sad war movie.

I'm so in love with this dude. Not in the traditional sense, it's just his lyrics speak the words that have been marked in my soul since creation. His artistry has left fingerprints on the hearts of many and I can't wait to see what the future holds for him.
My like is not staying! But I did it yesterday :( just know eden there is no way that someone with a soul doesn't like it ❤️❤️❤️
Was this video filmed in Ireland? I recognised alot of stuff in the video..
I listen to all of your official and unofficial song and I'm in love with all of them.it gives me a reason to live.sometimes the song that you write remind me the bad days that I feel so much pain and sadness but your songs give me happiness and energy at the same time because of that I never gonna stop listening your beautiful songs
Where was I when this track first got released? Ain't never too late to appreciate such killer vibez<333
My heart says.\nYour music is the most beautiful thing I've heard.
Something about this song just makes me feel, flawless
this is so beautiful and im in love with every word in this song
all I ask is to see the footage of my boy walking back from that last shot lol
This is real emotions . I'm glad he's trending , it means people are starting to feel and not just listen.  Thank you  eden !! ❤❤
uh eden , u get me i swear
idk the video made me uncomfortable\n but the music was 👌🔥
HOW DID I NOT SEE THIS
It's like sex.
Realmente não existe uma música desse homem que não seja perfeita, mds
It's so amazing. I'm so happy that I discovered you in 2014, your songs are my favourites! Keep it up!
wtf is wrong with people who dislike eden ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????
CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHY END CREDITS ISNT ON I TUNES
Why does Danielle bregoli' s absolutely shitty song with no effort or meaning behind it get more views than Eden, not to mention she's a hell of a lot less talented like it's not even funny, and Eden has been making much more amazing music for waaaaay longer than her, the Eden project is great and EDEN is just amazing.
i really miss your songs ;-;\nplease, keep making your art S2
Amazing song ! Also are you a secret abstergo agent ?
I think I love his voice more than his music.
Eden has helped me through so much. I wish I could meet him and tell him in person. Thank you for all that you do!
Love this Eden. You destroyed it!
Thank you so damn much for this
perfection. Jon, you're music woke me up
listening to this song near twelve o clock in the midnight, with no one but myself... calming in a way, EDEN always manages to sing about my feelings.
It got a frank's track something ! Anyway as good as usual !
AH EDEN WHY AREN'T YOU ON TRENDING YET HERE??!!
It's more addictive than drugs
I LOVE YOU EDEN!!!!!!!! 💙😭✨
oh no my boy is blowing up isnt he
Is it possible to like like this music more than once?
I fucking love u just don’t end please.
I love this song so much
Everybody be Like: WOOOW,CRONGRATS, YOU'RE IN THE TRENDS!!! \nI be Like: *looks at Trends* ... Why is my country so uncool?

Hahahah!! If you're not singing while driving, then why do you have a freakin car!! 🤣🤣🤣
Omg it was so wonderful seeing how excited you were!!
Currently going through a tough time and not having the best week, but your good vibes literally radiated through this video and made me smile. Thank you ❤️😊
I think your father is a bit late on that DNA test haha
In the beginning Amelia reminds me of Robin Williams in Mrs.Doubtfire when she dips her face in the soup and its drooping off of her face so she wont blow her cover 😂😂
I like the eyeliner she did on you !! It’s not so thick , and it flatters you eye shape . 🤗
Not a bad life, Amelia.  Not bad at all!
I love how she did your brows.
Amelia you're a really nice girl, but I'm not a fan of all these clickbait titles
Wow where did you get that picture of the peonies? I LOVE IT!!!
The RICE😍😍😍
Lol at 7:13-7:15 the guys in the background
sorry for being nosey but why are you all taking a dna test? i could really feel your positive vibes haha loved it x
Congrats Amelia, I am so happy for you! 4 years ago I bought my first pillowtalk lip liner after your recommendation and I loved it! Since then I have repurchased over and over again! I recently bought the very victoria & pillowtalk lipstick and I fell in love with her matte formulas! Same happened with her light wonder foundation, sooooo good and natural looking! Every product I have tried from her makeup and skincare line in full size or in a sample version, I ended up  loving it and buying it! She does her best and deserves all the praise for that! I wish there were more people so passionate and dedicated to their job like her! By the way, I watched the entire video you did with her and you were adorable! You deserve all this success Amelia!
I love the Dior tour🙋
U r such a darling love u so much. I feel lots of positivity from just watching u alone. And I recommended ur channel to many of my friends I knew. Lots of love from Singapore 😘👱🏻‍♀️❤️
Wow, what a video, you seem to have a charmed life this month. You look and sound amazing, really enjoyed this video.
What is the name of that type of rice? The mum-made rice, its the same type of rice Amelia has made in other videos! What is it called? I really want to try making it... it looks so good!
The dress you wore to the dinner was so pretty. Just perfect for the occasion. I love Jasmine. My niece wore a Jasmine headdress in her wedding in India and it was beautiful.
Karaoke in the car! Fun times!!
That Dior mascara was wow!  J'adore is one of my favorite fragrances.  I can't wait to get a whiff of the new one.
Ahhh you are good for the soul Amelia😊
Amelia I couldn't stop laughing by the end of it with your face mask 🤣 by the way you looked so pretty when CB did your makeup! The foundation/ contouring looked amazing as well . You always look gorgeous anyway. Loved the video ❤️
OMG you always look so glamorous! I literally just walked my dog in unicorn onesie pajamas LOLOL <3 xx
just curious as to what you do when  there is food at an event. do you tell them your restrictions or just eat some if it?
awesome video but seriously..all these 25 minutes ive been so distracted by your nails..WHAT NAIL COLOUR IS THAT!!?Looks gorgeous,love you!
The face mask thou hahahahahahha :D
❤️❤️❤️
Amelia you are so lovely!! But the yellow sunglasses are just well, NO :D :D
Giiir what are your glasses when you were driving from?????? ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Where is the gorgeous picture/poster of the pink peonies from? \nLove it 😍😍😍
What's the name of the blusher Charlotte used on you, it looked great!
What are konkers (sp)?
17:19 Fanny Bourdette in the background 💜
Your awesome ❤️
What’s conker? Chestnut?
apparently they dont test on animals but arnt vegan?
The more you talked the more that face mask deteriorated 🤣
Loved your vlog 😍😍 What nail polish are you wearing? Lots of love ❤️
I prefer the way you do your own make up. You are gifted at elevating subtlety, be it with color, style, jewelry, outfits, etc....you don't need experts---you are gifted, and you need not be intimidated by othersd, Amelia. You are elegant, refined, kind, loyal, and I wish you lots of joy and blessings.❤️
I was just laughing my a** off seeing you with the face mask on! So funny 😂
Girl the dior chateau was a dream 😁
Amelia you look amazing darling!!!!!!😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘Charlotte is just such a sweetheart I'm sure you where on cloud9 best wishes from Ireland 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
Duke is the most adorable puppy I've ever seen! What breed is he?
Love this!
The  fields 😍
conkers are my favorites...
I love that black Chanel at the salon you had. Updated bag collection please?
I feel so happy to see that you are happy Amelia!
19 kilos is nothing - that suitcase weighs like 18 on its own!  So beautiful, but so heavy. I bought the (not as pretty) lightweight version because I could barely pick that one up 😂
You looked SO pretty in that but dress at Dior....<3
This was such a good video. It's always a treat to see Duke & Dior's house is fantastic. Thanks
Dior's house looked divine! What an adventure <3
LMAO at your face mask at the beginning! every time you jump cut, it just keeps sagging lower and lower. Legit burst out laughing at 2:33 xoxo
Love Charlotte! can you please post the link to the coat you are wearing whilst walking Duke? the one above isn't working. Thanks
What's a conca?? A chestnut???
You make me feel so energetic . You are always cheerful
You're living a fairytale right now. So happy for you I hope it lasts forever. \nLiterally goals ❤❤
Okay love your hair color 10x more now. I liked it before but now...it's perfect!
If she is Charlotte  u r Amelia  u r really  one of best  make  up  bloggers  🙂
So exciting, thank you for sharing. PLEASE can you share your 23andme DNA results? The results are always so interesting! xx
I don't know what happened with youtube but your video was not in my subscription box. Am I the only one?
I 100% only started driving for the singing in the car!
the bit where you're talking about conkers with that mask on was so funny because you looked so crazy lololol
I love your earrings Amelia! Where did you get them?
This is what living your dream looks like💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
The food looked amazing! please can you share the salad & rice recipes?
The tour of Dior's home was magnificent! Thank you so much for sharing that beauty with us! I'll have to go back and pause it to really study the rooms. So much to see in a split second!
That ghemeh bodamjoon looked pretty good though! If that's how you spell it 😂😂
omega i love your chanel!!! is it a recent purchase? xxx
I love love the highlighter on you. It's making me want to buy it
Why always some judging people are here? They always tell her wht to do about her fashion lens makeup and even life! They should know they bother Amelia and some peop who enjoy her vids.
Such an honor having Charlotte Tilbury do your makeup! You look fabu!
An hour late for an engagement party! The Persian in you is showing!
You singing along to Taylor swift in the car is literally me driving home tonight
I think thats the first time Amelia has ever sworn in a video and I had to do a double take on that! Great video!
You talking with that face mask on, had me howling!! 😂
damn it amelia!! i fricken love you.. i wish i lived in the UK so i could meet you. i live in Canada (shoutout to Estee) so not possible. but anyways ill just continue to lol and talk to myself as I'm watching your videos. xx <3 <3
You're so sweet
Girl, that face mask is out to get you! 😂
That laugh in the beginning reminded me of ross from friends
The best!!!!  Of all the trips I've seen YouTubers take this was the best ever.  I want to be you. Great vid.
hi i was at the same tome that you were picking up jasmin I was waiting for you in front of the field and i've jell so much AMELIA but people were like we haven't seen you so unlucky have you seen me ? do you know if you will comme back?  my school is next to the domaine de manon bye sorry for my mistakes i  am french
Love your vlogs! Always inspiring me to vlog more in London too!!! 😘
Actually randomly early for once! Great vid as always Amelia 😘
Wait what is a conker??
Pretty pink flowers speak to me too Amelia, I completely understand haha
Hello! Lovely video! \nWhere is your peony wall picture from? Thanks x
Hello, Miami girl here. Had to google what a conker was, we don't have those here!! Lol. Super beautiful video, impeccable style as always. Such a dream life surrounded by beautiful places and people 😍
Can you tell which earrings you are wearing pls xx
What song were you singing
wtf is a conker..... british ppl are crazy
Hi Amelia.\nJust want to let you know dr Josh axe's youtube video was talking about how to get rid of SIBO naturally.\nIf you never seen it maybe you can take a look. \nHope you will get well soon!\n\nBest wishes
Amelia, your videos simply make my day. You are genuine and I think you should do more chatty videos. I love hearing you talk xxxx
You are the funniest. I love you for that. So I have a question for you. Do you like more fashion or make up?
aww watched the lifestream while I was baking :D loveee the result and now I really want to own those eyeshadows :Dxx
I just got my results from my 23andme test 😳
Do you remember the name of the Dior documentary? His house looks like amazing and would love to learn more about him!
No disrespect to Ms. Tibury but I prefer the way you do your makeup. :) You really know how to transform your already gorgeous face!
Nick is sexy as fuck
Please do Justin Roiland on one of these
He was so much more sweet and thoughtful than anyone else.
Bryan, 25. Phish, The Grateful Dead.... First pic is me and the best  mom in the world at a show. We go to a ton of concerts together HAHA, Tinder is fucking full of weirdos
Y'all see that tuna?
It's crazy Ira annnnd the DOUCHE!!
I wanted to see what her friend answered back
What a nice guy Nick is.
why does his forehead look like a hydraulic press crushed it
Hey, I don't have kids . But I'll put one in ya 😂😂💀
I'd pay to see Tinder Takeover with Jeff dunham
Man I haven't laughed this hard in ages!
😂 nope that's been on my tinder ellaaa.. OH HELLO BE MY FRIEND ELLA
this guy's not funny irl & it's sad because you can tell he tries really hard unlike eric andre
Nick Kroll is a national treasure.
Can you imagine if you saw yourself on this video haha
He starts talking about how it's okay to mess up on a text right after he sent one that started with I will I am tall.
Did....did he just say Cyrano de Borat? Okay, I'm in love.
His eyes are the most unique color of green. Beautiful
Nick Kroll is a savage.
When u gotta pretend like you've never used tinder
Plot twist, these two should date!!!!
Boris really out here making moves.
Can Nick Kroll date Ella? I think they'd be good together
Boris was a kool dude though. I respect the game
Another reason for me to kms
first mistake, you're using tinder. tinder is for lonely fools that want to stay lonely but get stds too
this made me love nick kroll even more holy fuck
I fucking lost it when his immediate response to that photo was Oh, hello!
Your great Nick Kroll and Ella hope tinder went well
Count how many times she fake laughs
Can we please have a follow up on Borris? I gotta know
didn't know who Nick Kroll was before watching this; definitely a good dude, funny but real and on point - that aside about sending a bad text is amazing
why don't they ever do this for a guy?
Wow I love this item. http://amzn.to/2xJYbzw
I just recognized this guy as the douche 😂
That’s my name
So this is why kroll got his shows canceled not funny
We love your video! Come check out ours 💕 https://youtu.be/m0nGJCK_tzU
This whole video I couldn't look away from Nick Kroll's amazingly beautiful green eyes
Was I the only one rooting for her and Nick Kroll to end up together?
Do you wanna fuck bro?  Is in the running for greatest text ever.
Can you plz get Sarah Silverman to do this
It's the douche like if u watched park and rec
they r waiting on that town 'to go home'
LOL Abdiel is a friend of mine.

TEAM BORIS!!!! Ella and Boris is my OTP
He said oh hello and I'm hooked

God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
Anyone notice that the time is the same in all the shots of the phone/tinder, could be because of the screen capture they used or it could be faked
I love that her and her friend were dressed up as the characters from Oh Hello. so great!
Wasn't Ella in that Extra Gum commercial?
Nick's eyes are everything....
If Ella doesn't want Boris, I'll take him
Am I the one who thought they got a text when alyssa Marino came on the screen
hit me up on tinder Ella
Cyrano de Borat?
KROLL how did you miss saying Bye Bye Birdy 9:48
Excellent
Oh, hello!

So happy you're uploading more videos these days! Thank you/<3
Did mykie and chase break up?
You should check out the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett! Also it would be so awesome if you could do your own version of how the characters would look :-D
Hey mykie wat color is ur blue hair dye like wat shade blue and name of the color
Watching you try to eat was priceless!
I know you LOVE Melanie Martinez so how about you do a video showing how to do the sfx in her “Mad Hatter” music video (where she peels her face off to be exact😉😱)
Audible was how I read the entire GOT series. Over halfway through my second listen through now. Do one of the children of the forest!
i love you so much
YAS that them song fucks me up
THIS would make George R.R. Martin so proud of you !
I can't even watch GOT but I love this  😂
I would love to see you on 'Face off' !!!
i officially love you!
DO CAROLINE WITH BUTTON EYES😩😩😩😩😩😩

OMGGGGGG, I LOVE GAME OF THRONES, I definitely bend the knee to this makeup! Slaaaaay
Because of your hair you look like Evan Peters character in season 7 of American horror story
I want to see mykie's cotton ball collection I feel like you got a full room of just cotton balls.
It's hard to believe that someone so beautiful turned themself into THAT
Will you do a Cheshire cat tutorial and make the smile out of cotton and latex?
Same lol forced myself to watch the first 3 seasons and then it just gets SO good SO fast
Haha. Before the tutorial started I watched an ad for Game of Thrones. :-D
Mykie I really want to be a velociraptor for Halloween... can you help?
I want to be khaleesi for Halloween but I don't know where to get a dress bc in eBay sometimes they're not good quality
I literally JUST started GOT. It's pretty good so far! I've read a couple of the books at least. This is awesome!!! Also, would love to hear your book recommendations...would you consider sharing them at least on twitter if not in a video? <3
yOU SHOULD DO A HANAHAKI DISEASE SFX MAKE UP TUTORIAL ITS SOO COOL!!\n\nif you dont know what the hanahaki disease is its basically a fictional disease in a one-sided relationship where the infected starts coughing and vomiting flower petals:D

Ok so you have to listen to WE’RE ALIVE it’s a Zombie audio drama. You can find it on the podcast app. And it’s free.
If it's a prosthetic that protects your face, couldn't you use paints such as acrylics?
Yassss the glam & gore pumpkin is back!! lol I freaking love fall & Halloween!!!! & Mykie is one of the main reasons!! 😊 xo

Mykie: The NightQueen
*GRUDGE GIRL PLEASE I NEEED HELP FOR HALLOWEEN AND NOTHING IS ON THE INTERNET FOR A GOOD COSTUME*.
they had me shook when they shot the dragon then revived it , i was done.
Mykie this might be to much to ask but for everyone's sake who can't afford the fancy Halloween makeup is there anyway you can show us how to do cool makeup looks with the Walmart/dollar store grease makeup kits without latex unless it was in it?
Soooooooooooo I'm not trying to start drama, but are Mykie and Chase still together....? We haven't seen him in a while...
Could u do a creepy coraline look? Maybe the other mother or an alternate coraline where she agrees to sewing the buttons in her eyes. P.s this look is so detailed and amazing YOU SO COOOLLL
Since Stranger Things season 2 is coming out on Halloween, you should do a tutorial for the demogorgon... I don't know if that's possible, but it would be SO awesome.
love it, and game of thrones !!
Oh, how I've missed the intro with the pumpkin🎃🎃
I got really hyped for this especially because of a vld ad popped up before this
Oh Mykie... you are such a nerd 💚
After a long day in the hairsalon to get an internship I'm living for this music
Can you do Nearly-Headless Nick?
i'm going to be dany
I have never seen Game of Thrones. But, I am thinking of watching it.
he was so calm!!!
at the moment your hair looks exactly like Evan Peter‘s in the new season of AHS
Do you find cotton better than a flour-paste mix? Thanku
Season 4 episode 2...I believe she means the blond lesbians death?
Seriously tho, in LA I could  LITERALLY see a naked person jumping down the street in a pogo stick, and I wouldn't even bat an eye.
I remember trying to eat with facial prosthetics on my face..it hurt so much..I could barely eat the big ol' burger I got at Acen this year. XD so feels

WINTER IS HERE ZOMBAES
YOU READ MY MIND WTF
An early lesson in expectations.
Woah did she just assume the gender of that unborn baby?
*British crying*
but there are 76 genders, how do you know its a boy
lol stupid children
Lesbian feminist in the making.
Talk about a perfect accidental commentary on modern day society.
Don't feed her too many candies.
Sexist bitch
I thought this was very cute until I realized that his is her typical behavior she has adapted to, in order to earn blue sweeties. =(
Cuteness overload! God bless you all!
so funny when grownup neo-feminists act like exactly the same way sometimes
I agree with this little girl 100%.   It is a completely valid opinion.
Fuck, people dumb enough to still film vertically squeezing more out.
Siobhan, turn off the comments. They're saying awful things about your children. Just turn them off!
that is one ugly kid
If you think she's being mean, let me tell you that I stepped on my brother's throat after he was born because I wanted to be an only child. (He's fine, i didn't press my foot too hard. My parents saw and stopped me). I also tried to strangle him on several occasions and there's even a picture of it
I know this is British, but can any of you Brits tell me what area this accent is attributed to?
my little too when she he a him.
I came for the comments and I am not disappointed.
Fake tears, the parents have taught her to be this way through poor reinforcement. She cries, then gets rewarded with candy. Unsurprisingly, her tears end immediately.
He\n He\n  He\nShe's funny.
What a brat. You can tell the kid uses crying to get what she wants. And these parents videotape as if it's amusing. Just wait 10 years.
Start saving and you can pay for his surgery, little girl.
This wouldn't happen in China. It would be more like Good news! We're having a boy so we don't have to infanticide your new sibling like we almost did with you.
you know what this video really means. the boys are her school are not very nice to her
I'd grab that little fucker and shake her violently. Then sell her to my friend Jeremy Epstein. John Posestda will pay top dollar too
*Did you just assume that baby's gender what the fuck you are literally hitler I am calling CPS right now prepare to have your life ruined and your family torn apart!!!!!!!!!!!!!*
That boy is going to be tortured for at least the first 10 years of his life.
I had a british older sister, she was mean and didn't want me either lmao
It boggles my mind why parents like this are so eager to share their shitty parenting with the rest of the world.
I wouldn't leave her alone in the room with the new baby, just sayin
Hi Siobhan I work for @DailyBlasLive! We would love to use this adorable video please email me at alexie.pincus@dailyblastlive.com
Sexist toddler! haha xD
Hopefully her brother realizes he is a she and gets HRT therapy before she can walk.
Good luck with all that, little guy.
Your kid is dumb
Circi Lannister's first home movie
feminism in a nutshell
Damn feminist brat
Bitch
Thanks for reminding me why I don't have kids.
Rescue a dog.  Problem solved.
new phone who dis?
Poor baby hahaha.
Giiiiiiiirrrrrrrrllll
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
She needs to step away from the Pop Tarts from time to time, methinks.
Tell her the baby boy is trans and can dress her up like a girl.
Feminism already corrupting the youth smh tbh fam
Brat
My parents did the same thing when my sister was going to be born. I still wish she was a boy...
just cut off his penis
Cheer up, little one! These days, newborns get to choose their gender! So, they just might end up being a girl after all!\nHopefully your tax funded public school administration will get the gender situation sorted out early on by Pre-K! Good luck!
Beggars can’t be choosers
www.reddit.com sent me here and oh my god im glad i dont have a fuckin annoying girl like that as my kid the parents are obviously pussy liberals for letting this happen my sister would have never acted like that because my parents believed in spanking not being a pussy parent who gives trophys for everything
dumb cunt dont sideways film u dumb whore and beat ur ugly ass kid. dont ever let them talk back like its nothing dumb whore
fucking annoying little kid
THAT LITTLE GIRL IS JUST LIKE THE REDDIT COMMUNITY, CRYING OVER SOME STUPID SHIT, AND UPSET THAT THEY CANT GET THEIR WAY. POOR BABIES
I really felt her pain; that was so sad :(  Saddest thing ever.  never watching this type of stuff again its horrible.
You gotta show this on her wedding day..
Hi, I'm Ivana from Rumble.com. We are interested at featuring your amazing video on our site. Please email me at ivana@rumble.com for more info. Thanks!
As a kid I used to think this was just a show full of boring dialogue but as I've grown older I see it's an OK show.
its kind of funny that this warrior Work, always get his butt kicked. =)
Pls do 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' (but be culturally sensitive)
Chuck Norris is the only man/thing Klingons will surrender to.
Say AND I'LL GO OUT AND FIND SOME MORE OF THAT MULAN SZECHUAN TERIYAKI DIPPING SAUCE, MORTY!! in your EPIC VOICE
He remains dedicated to his dialogue even when it's obvious the writers fell asleep on their keyboards!  LMAO!!
This was a thing???
Yeah, Gates McFadden has it all...  hotta hotta hot.
Do a honest trailer on kamasutra the movie.
Can't wait to rewatch this shtick
I thought you'd bring up that other terrible episode where aliens say Starfleet ships are ripping holes in space and every ship had to go slow from now on. That ep was never mentioned ever again.
do buffy the vampire slayer and angel plzzzz plzzzz plzzzz
You guys should do an honest trailer for Vikings
This was hilarious, truly. The part at 2:41 probably had me laughing the hardest. Dr. Crusher, who's...just kinda there most of the time. That line combined with the scene of Crusher coming out of the turbo lift and stopping dead in her tracks looking all confused absolutely killed me!
The worst movie in the world has risen in popularity... DO A HONEST TRAILER ON THE AMAZING BULK I DARREEEE YAAAA
Ok. Now, we need one for the rest of the shows, starting with TOS!\n\nAlso, nice call back to Ernie Anderson with Staaaaar Trek!
Do the original blade runner!
Sorry but next generation isn't as good the original.
The comments section Maneuver!!!!
What is the piece of music that starts in the background at 5:40? I know it's not from Trek, but it sounds very familiar.
Do the step up movies! Please.
This is the best one you've ever made! Bravo. Hilarious.
A Swiss Army Man Honest Trailer would be hilarious! <3
Kirk all the way. The OG.
Palm strikes for the win.
Boldly subscribe?  Does this mean Canada actually gets a TV show in a better way than the States for once?. :o
Do the Sharknado films !!! Please, this are amazing! (note the sarcasm)
I used to get so mad when I was a young man and watched this show, cause it seemed that the biggest warrior in the cast (Worf) kept getting the crap kicked out of him. The maneuvers you showed were HILARIOUS... well done, Screen Junkies.
Not even a single star wars joke? Shame on you screen junkies shame on you!
Do a blade runner honest trailer before the new one comes out
Can you do *The Lost Boys?* \n_Also, could you say Another visitor...stay awhile...STAAAY FOREVER!!!!!?_ Please and thanks!
Can u guys do Real Steel with Hugh Jackman
Maybe if we felt any loss as keenly as we felt the death of one close to us, human history would be a lot less bloody. Commander Riker S3-E5 The Bonding If all humans thought this way the world would be beautiful. Of all the quotes from Star Trek TNG, this one has always started in my heart. I try to love my life by those  parameters
No A-team joke? Barclay took over the entire Enterprise using just his brain
Please do Valhalla Rising.  That movie is awesome.  And seriously bleak
4:55. Did I see Troy's nipple?
I liked this as soon as I saw Honest Trailer + Star Trek.
considering his artificial heart would not have changed in the transporter accident, should not have Picard died?
say in captain voice: im acting
Whenever a member of the crew is possessed and gets super strength, it's always Worf who suffers
You should do the kingsglave 😀
I bet the next honest trailer will be for Blade Runner!
Please say Mr. Clean is the man, behind that shine. Is it wet, or is it dry?
OMG, there needs to be a DS9 Honest Trailer!
Star Trek was before my time Ive never seen or been interested in watching but this trailer really makes me want to watch it.
you ought to do either Doctor Who or StarGate after this, y;know
Hey it's the Not Doctor Who Honest trailer I haven't been waiting for
Here in Mexico Star Trek is on Netflix instead of CBS All Access. So win win.
Say: COUNTRY ROOOOOOOADS TAKE ME HOOOOOOOOOME TO THE PLAAAAAAAACE I BELOOOOOOOOOONG D':
y'all should do Gotham
DO IT!! Like the movie about the clown... honestly that title it makes it so hard to look things up about it.
So glad the Riker Maneuver got a mention!!
Or can you do Justified?
Do Stephen Kings It
The Borg's were seriously some of the best villains ever, never forget about them and i didn't really watch Star Trek like that
Kirk or Picard?  Captain Sisko is the superior officer.
Watch & download a movie,/ Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie ( 2017 )./Two overly imaginative pranksters named George and Harold, hypnotize their principal into thinking he's a ridiculously enthusiastic, incredibly dimwitted superhero named Captain Underpants./Genres Action, Animation, Comedy./Download &view link....http://quainator.com/1Jiv
Do Buffy the Vampire Slayer
You forgot the entire series of episodes where they didn't actually go anywhere they just had aliens take over the ship.
Kirk or Picard? The obvious answer is: Sisko. (But man, Patrick Stewart is too good for this century or the next!)
The correct answer to “Kirk vs Picard” is Sisko!
Great! Now do Star Trek: Deep Space Nine... the best Star Trek series ever.
You guys have to do Spider-Man: Homecoming.
Honest Trailer - War for the Planet of the Apes
Do a full trailer on the Original Series of Star Trek

<3 to Dan!
DO YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN!!!!
Do blade runner HONEST TRAILER PALESE
I wish they would make new series of this but 100% identical in terms of cgi.
Hey Rhett & Link, I know this will get lost in the comments but, I just want to say I really appreciate this specific Wheel of Mythicality. I am Puerto Rican and while I live in Massachusetts I have quite a few family members who live in down there, including my grandfather from my dads side. He was hospitalized a week ago with an infection in his leg and because of the lack of medicine and resources the infection spread and they're gonna have to amputate it. You guys always put a smile and my face even in hard times and the fact that you guys take a moment to acknowledge and help those in need makes, me love you guys even more. From the bottom my heart, thank you, and you make me want to be my mythical best!
THE BOOK OF MYTHICALITY IN THE BACK MAKES ME SO EXCITEDDD
I've seen a lot of giant roadside coffee pots but I’ve never gotten a chance to see the oldest
Is the Unicef donation actually going to Puerto Rico
Oh no not Unicef... They were exposed 6 years ago for being one of the biggest scamming charities available in north america
6:48 - Traitor Joe's\n\n(I know I'm late to the party, but it seems like no one else made the pun for me...)
As someone who is lactose intolerant as well, I suggest Lactaid pills for Rhett for when he knows he's going to be eating milk products. :)
Hey you reading!\n\nYou are beautiful.\nYou are smart.\nYou are talented.\nYou are kind.\nYou are strong.\nYou are enough.\nHave a nice day :)
More like Traitor Joe’s.
Maybe the dog treats taste pumpkin to dogs
... Hurricane Maria really devastated the country [of Puerto Rico]. > < It's still our country, guys! But totally agree- they need help and lots of it. Good to see the support.
My dogs eat the guts of punkings
They ate off brand Oreos without milk. I’m hurting.
Are those jo-jo's a freaking JOJO REFERENCE!?
We don't have them flavours over here in England so sad. I love that taste.🍊
Pumpkin spice is not made of pumpkin. Taste testing simply pumpkin flavored items isn't the same thing. I feel cheated by this video.\nPumpkin spice is the spices you put into pumpkin pie to make it not taste like gourd. Pumpkin pie filling isn't even pumpkin either, but that's a different issue.\nThis whole fall season is shaping up to be an ontological nightmare.
PUMKIN BUTTER AND APPLE BUTTER ARE THE BEST THINGS IN THE WORLD ANYONE THAT HASN'T TRIED IT PLEASE DO
Omg I love Pumpkin Spice! I'm craving a pumpkin spice latte right now! :D Loved the video, as always!
not pumpkin flavored dog treats? well now i need to get a dog buy those treats and then sue trade joes for false advertising.
Is there such thing as pumpkin spice custard
The bagel had a very satisfying crunch sound.
I love coffee ice cream!!!!
shout out to all the kids who watch GMM and don't understand Rhett's shirt.
I'm eating JOE JOE'S
I love these types of videos! Thanks for the entertainment and education :)
Why didn't they put the pumpkin butter on the bagels???
Should have gotten the pumpkin cream cheese... so good.
******LOOK FOR WHO VOTES FOR AND AGAINST MEDICARE FOR ALL*******
I like the shirt.
You have to bee friend the honey roaster link
I don't like mint chocolate chip ice cream but LOVE pumpkin spice
Dose anybody else think why is Rhett not in the thumbnail it's always likn
You can give pumpkin to a dog for constipation
Glad you are all making money and stuff.... But just stop. Let this show be a good thing, before it turns into desperate.
The donation was so nice 😭💓💓
5:45 My dog was on a pumpkin only diet for a while for medical reasons, so yeah, dogs eat pumpkin.
Rhett wasn't wearing that shirt the whole time!!
I DO NOT CARE FOR THE GUY ON THE RIGHT.
The books in the background
Hey mythical crew, you guys rock and are one of the main reasons gmm is such a great thing; without your skills and everything you do on and off camera the show wouldn't have the same quality, emotions, and vibes. Keep it up guys and don't  get discouraged by rude people that forget they are insulting real people and are not aware of everything you guys do.
Is it just me or does Link kinda look like a nerdy Yelawolf?!?!?!
The High Definition Chewing sounds  started back in S7E131 vegan food taste test....
Wasn't the original pumpkin spice the blend of spices that went into pumpkin pie? Cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.
My mother always makes pumpkin bread during the fall. Best damn stuff I ever ate bread wise. Only issue is that eating too much pumpkin makes me crap like no tomorrow.
I don’t see the problem with the crew laughing
I work at Trader Joe's and I'm already sick of pumpkin
Omg is eating dog treats normal for them they acted like it was an everyday thing and no one else said anything. I was so confused 😂??
the laughter in the background is alright but seems too much this episode
10:09 or as shane would say It Gets Worse
My god. I love Rhett and link but my respect for them just went way down. As an almost fluent Spanish speaker, I am offended that they got tortilla, the whitest Spanish word, wrong. if you do not know  the Spanish alphabet, the double L sounds like a Y.
why we don't  see mike and alex more often???
I could smell the pumpkin spice emanating from this video wow
Link didn't wear that shirt the whole time...
Why do you have a live laughtrack of people. Its really funkin annoying.
Rhett:That's Good |Link:That's Bad | Link: Oooh, it gets better!
not everything pumpkin flavored has pumpkin spice in it.
They seem amped in this episode. Something's different--are they fighting?  Hope not...
Thank you so much for donating to  the maria disaster in puerto rico im really gratefull as im puerto rican but live in the U.S but i have family in puerto rico so thank you #levatandopuertorico
We like the laughing
How many oldest biggest coffee pots could possibly have been competing for that award. Haha. Like really what a specific thing.
Thank you for donating $1000 to Puerto Rico I have family there and my dad lost his garage roof, and Link was not wearing that GMM shirt the the whole time
They have pumpkin spice cream cheese. Not Trader Joe's though lol.
Was that a JoJo reference?
I actually like the laughters. Makes it feel more real. Less planned.
Here in the netherlands, we don't have that flavor so i've never tried it😬.\nI'm so curious about it though, what do you guys think??
coffe ice cream is the best
Do Will it Parfait? Like if you agree...
I've heard of Jojo's, but I know them as potato wedges, not cookies.
You can feed orgainic pumpkin puree to dogs for tummy aches and to get more fiber in their diet :)
Thank you guys for your support for Puerto Rico. My family there is safe but theres millions in despair with no food, water and shelter. GRACIAS, DIOS LOS BENDIGA!!!! Q VIVA GMM!!!!!!
Plain pumpkin is great for dogs actually. It helps with constipation and other GI discomfort. Ask your vet for the right proportion for yours, but mine was always a Tbsp per 50 lbs. Dog ate it like a treat and within a few hours no more crying fur baby. Just do NOT use the spiced can version, only the original pumpkin purée.
My teacher had us watch one of your sea animal videos and it was awsome
pumpkin flavored dog treats?  even the  dogs are taking part in pumpkin spice everything....lol
I have not watched GMM in forever and that new intro shocked me
Yassss
STOP NOW
Too much
the way link ripped into the bagel bag rather than untie it pissed me off lmao
trader joes ice cream is my favorite
Feeding dogs pureed pumpkin helps make their poops more solid if they're too runny
Pumpkin ice cream is soooo good
Pumpkin Spice? IT BEGINS!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ch8MzYclx5I
I love pumpkin pie. I despise pumpkin spice. It tastes nasty.
I appreciate crew laughter
I feel completely indifferent towards pumpkins 😂
http://vire.info/?cash=12982
*clicks on video\nPause\nDislike \nLeave*
Boring
EMMA CHAMBERLAIN DID THIS!
Yaaaaas bring back RANKED
Rhett: Thats good\nBatman: Thats bad
Dogs eat pumkin it's  good for them
=idek=
no Link dogs eat pumpkins my grampa gives his dog buddy canned pumpkin everyday
OMFG 666DISLIKES!!!! AM CURSED!!
next up: will it honey roast?
Seriously though, the laughing every 10 seconds... it's really distracting and annoying. Great video as always but man, it was hard to enjoy
They have pumpkin spice pop tarts that are amazing, fail for not including! 👎🏻
Sorry guys, I don't often turn off a GMM video, but the crew shouldn't laugh every time either Rhett or Link open their mouths. It's very distracting, at least turn them down in the mix
Hi subscrbe
My only qualm:\n\nI know it's stupid, but...\n\nNo. It's not stupid to feel unimportant when you're trying to have a conversation about something that matters to you with someone that matters to you. It's not stupid to feel hurt or to ask to have just a moment of their undivided attention😕
This is amazing advice but it's very situational. Don't do this with a narcissist, or anyone who is emotionally immature. In both childhood and adulthood I've expressed when I'm hurt to my parents, and their immediate reaction was denial, rejection and gas-lighting. Rarely will they apologize and soften up. My mother, who adores being the victim in any circumstance, can never bring herself to a proper apology, it is always I'm sorry you misinterpreted what I said to anyone and everyone.... If you practice this with these type of people, it can draw up a lot of resentment and make it harder to open up (or be open) to someone who is genuinely emotionally there for you. So yes, good advice, but be careful. The supportive and emotionally vulnerable girlfriend is not always the reaction. Sometimes she'll lash out and say you're making her out to be the villain.
*I want to address the line: I have a big ego by asking you for your attention, forgive me.* Asking someone for their attention doesn't mean you have a big ego, it simply means you want to connect. If said person has abruptly stopped conversing with to play Candy Crush or Facebook, that is fine, you can leave them be and have the conversation another time or you can ask them for their attention. _I feel that should be said. if you think I am wrong then by all means, critique me.
first time clicking on this, i thought it was gus johnson in the thumbnail........................................................
I've always wonder at The School Of Life is this advice to help everyone no matter where we are in life. Wether you are a 14 year old in the states or a 23 year old attending college are you all makerting to every person?
I see myself in this.
which one of yall read the monologue in the narrator’s voice
is it ok if i show that i'm hurt, angrily?
hey how does the rest of the calmer discussion end???
It's so like us..even the topic of conversation
I feel like dealing with the pain of being alone is much easier than dealing with the pain (and annoyance, and stupid bullshit) of being in a relationship.
men have pride ,women have harsh-head ,nothing would work except long time arguing to relieve the stress .... arguing is a solution to say everything you want to say
As a woman, I find vulnerability in men almost invariably attractive. Many feel so much pressure to be stoic or strong that it feels hard to get to know the real person within. So revealing weakness to me feels like a gesture of trust, which I find ultimately flattering. (Egocentric motivation, I suppose 😏 at least in part) I am slow to trust, so the vote of confidence means worlds to me.\n\nHowever, I will admit there are caveats: \n1. When someone has hurt me very badly, and they express guilt or shame upon releazing my hurt, I do feel somewhat satisfied and take pleasure in their pain, but only to the extent that I feel it evens the score (no more than I hurt for no longer than I hurt). This is only in extreme situations.\n2. ‎When people use a facade of honesty as an excuse for being an asshole or venting raw emotion carelessly without any effort towards tact or self-restraint. (Basically launching a personal attack under the guise of just being honest.)\n3. ‎When I feel their expressing hurt is actually a tale of woe aimed at manipulating my emotions intentionally to make me feel sorry for them and reduce their culpability. Or if I notice that particular person seems to have a pervasive victim mentality, even if they are not consciously aware of it. This is frustrating. Taking responsibility is key.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, I can deal with sadness quite well, but not anger. Anger antagonizes, whereas sadness invites empathy.
Naturally, it goes both ways. If someone courageously admits that he/she felt hurt, then you should properly and eagerly listen to them without hitting back.
Unless you're dating a sociopath as they will use any vulnerability you show against you.
I like how they learn to communicate better on this one thing, then argue about something else afterwards. It seems realistic to point out that this will not end all conflict.
of course he’s right, it’s very disrespectful
What should someone do if a fight starts based on your confession about being vulnerable? When your partner instead of just accepting your vulnerability wants to go deeper and this makes you feel under judgement? He just wants to understand, but i just want to be accepted and these questions especially when i am trying to fight my anger seem so inappropriate for that moment
I can not relate to someone who takes out their cellphone before a conversation is over. It's phenomenally rude. That cellphone is going in the toilet.
You know what? The second way of reacting sounded much stronger than the first, childish one. Remaining calm feels like a very both empathic and confident person.
Crying is not just for infants.  Haven't you ever experienced a scene in a movie where an adult cries?  Yes, even adult men... especially men.  It's very moving.  Crying gets you in a different place than the part of your brain that is trying to protect YOURSELF...now you feel protective (compassionate) toward the other person.\n\nAlso, some people below had questions about how to express that someone is hurting you, in a work context.  Here is what I have seen, and does not make the person look weak:  Say, Ouch.  That's it.  Then quickly move on.  There isn't time for the person you are speaking to,  to mount a counter-attack; they might even be slightly confused (they didn't realize the stupidity/insensitivity of what they were saying).  But later they will think back at what they said (because you said Ouch) and they'll get it.
Its hard to identify when the people in the video are so annoying.
I tried scenario two once and got told to not be such a baby, y e a h, that's doesn't work either.
These videos are pretty bad lately.. terrible acting
thank you . this came at the perfect time
I break up usually
What is the background music?
This shit doesn't work. They will tell you to get over it, a partner that cares about you doesn't do shit they know will upset you unless it is unavoidable.
I wish it were that easy. I'm glad sometimes it is. It should be our first line of defense. It seems though that there are people who watch for that kind of thing to use it. Sociopaths. And if you are with them, well I just don't know if there's any good way to deal with someone who eats off of your vulnerability. Who waits for it and hopes for it to use it against you. \n        I guess if you get a healthy person this is the best way. But if you were predisposed, trained to be in defective relationships from childhood, well it's a bit more complicated. But not to be given up on.... it's just going to take more time and focus to fix all the backwards stuff you were trained to accept.
Yeah. It doesn't work in today's fearful/narcissistic society. It doesn't work. Show your hurt, women leave. Show your hurt, men take advantage of it.
Great acting / depiction of real couple arguments
Sometimes I want angry make up sex, not apologetic tender sex.
Not working for me.... a person keeps hurting me and refusing to talk to me. No matter if I tell her I'm hurt or if I get mad. She just doesn't care. And I care for her so much. She's my sister, so it's not like I'll ever walk away from her. What can I do but just hurt silently? Addressing what's hurting you isn't always the answer because sometimes the person really is selfish and they aren't going to care.
JACK HOWARD IS IN IT. I SAW THE THUMBNAIL AND COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES!!! <3
He should have just got up and turkey slapped her....
Mind what you say. Words, like bullets, cannot be taken back.
Jack Howard!?! How'd I find you all the way over here?
Hello from Colombia. What about a video of schizophrenia? Causes, treatments and related things? Blessings from Sincelejo.
Jack Howard was a great choice for this video! : )\n\nI think most people are afraid if they show vulnerability, they will be mocked or hurt further. This is a good response to those fears. <3
Being lone is the best the way to avoid these problems.
Beautifully acted. Gave me an anxiety attack.
I wish you would do a video about someone trying to break their habit of being toxically submissive.The kind of quiet self restraint that helps no one in the end.
Ironic how they’re watching Germany Vs. Brazil 😂😂😂🤔🤔🤔🤣🤣🤣
Omg Jack Howard and School of Life crossover. Worlds colliding! 🌏
School of Life do you not realize that the lashing out and insulting behavior IS how people show thier hurt? What you are advocating isn't showing people you are hurt but rationally explaining why they feel hurt. Reveling in your negative emotions leads to negative responsess, like insults and attacks. You can not explain to another person why you feel hurt unless you know why yourself. This means taking a moment,  stepping back and examing your emotional state. In this video, in your positive example, the man explains to  the woman why he is hurt he doesn't show it. Most animals lash out after they have been hurt, the hardest part is stopping yourself from that behavior,  and this video does nothing to help with that part.
I lost someone I loved with all my heart when instead of being kind when I felt hurt by him, and explaining this to him nicely, I decided to lash out at him. I lost him. Lesson learned...entirely too late, though. 😞
Jack! I'm super pleased to see you.
I feel like relationship advice from The School of Life represents how ideal people in the ideal world SHOULD behave, rather than useful advice to be used in the real world with real people.
One should sacrifice if you want to understand each other
How do you handle it when you show hurt and they respond by mocking you? Let's also assume that, for the sake of having a real conversation, they are not evil monsters. They just have a difficult time taking emotions and related conversations seriously.
That's not Jim, that's Jack Howard.
What a good acting
FUCK that! She needs to listen! If he goes and finds someone else who will listen, then he's somehow wrong! GTFOH WITH THAT BULLSHIT! 😐
School of life please make more videos to enhance our emotional intelligence. The world is not kind:(
3 hours ago I had the same thing with my partner \nAt first I was angry and we argued about stupid things for half an hour\n \nBefore we go to bed he saw how sad i was and asked me in such a deep kind way  why are U upset   did I hurt you? \n\nAnger always makes things worse.
question: does this have something to do with bad parenting ?
The parallel the guy showed vulnerability by expressing how he was hurt? Well, the “bad” parallel to the “good” parallel would have been if she wasn’t acknowledging and accepted that she hurt him. Sometimes, if you tell someone that they hurt your feelings and how they hurt you, they’ll deny their part and blame you for being “too sensitive/emotional” or “I shouldn’t have to walk around eggshells around you” translation,”I have to think about what I say to you before I say it. I don’t want to be respectful of your thoughts and feelings.” or “Then, I must be the monster or the bad guy.” After, they’ll entice you to fight or argue back with them so they don’t feel like they’re the only monster or bad guy, thus they will push you to say something just as cruel or malicious so they feel they are on equal footing. “Now we’re both hurt, so you can’t say shit else.”
URGENT QUESTION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Is your voiceover guy the same voiceover guy from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy?! They sound the same!!!!!!!!! :o
Why is it always the guy that calls the problems you know it's usually the women that cause the problems
The hard part is getting to the point of having a relationship with someone. Luckily enough, I do not have troubles showing my weaknesses and having strength in those weaknesses.
Didn't work with me. I'm getting a divorce now.
I liked them more when they were fighting
begging of the end im afraid
Please do more of this kind of video :) :) touching and captivating
He is an oversensitive jerk.
I WISH... lól

Jack Howard ye
Jaaaaaaack
Oh, hey Jack Howard.
This is beautiful
And what happens when you tell your partner he hurt you, but he continues to do the same, and then blame you for feeling hurt and angry?
This is a skill that has taken years for me to learn. It is still terrifying to be so vulnerable but also rare for others to be honest about what they're feeling internally. This is an amazingly well constructed presentation on the concept. Bravo!!
eyy it's jack howard !
I'll tell you exactly what happens when you reveal your emotions to most women:  Awww, man up.  If there's one thing most women in my life couldn't handle its listening to men's emotions, they don't matter and they have the nerve to call US the whinebags at the slightest sign of complaint.
To be quite honest, I'm confused about how emotional intelligence is any different from intellectual intelligence-isn't rational thinking (essentially the type of thinking being endorsed here) a type of intellectual intelligence readily captured in existing IQ tests? We acknowledge that there is some kind of emotional disturbance, but choose to suppress or ignore it for the sake of rational thought and behavior. How is this type of thought different from the type of thinking required to decide to pull a train track switch to save 5 people instead of doing nothing and saving one?
I did that and she said I am not man enough and broke up.
I'm autistic and even I realise that getting out your phone while someone is trying to talk to you is offensive.  How does that make his ego fragile? Would the  women be fragile if the roles were reversed?\nPlease explain.
This sounds great but, my wife would call me a pussy if I showed my feelings. In fact she has before.

Omg my grandad did his military service in Murmansk in soviet times
You should have used a globe instead of a projection for this one
grise fiord, nunavut is the most northern town
Tromsø\nPronounced (bear with me, that ø is a vowel that doesn't occur in English) trohm-say (-ay has rounded lips)\nÅlesund\nPronounced Uh-lay-soond
I like that word stupid youtuber
Is there any internet there on that island?
Why would a Brit say that Edinburgh's the most northern town in the world? it's not even the most northern town in the UK.  I'm currently in Loch Ness, which is situated in Inverness, a whole city further north than Edinburgh.
As a Canadian, i'm actually happy that you put up a picture of two tents in Alert and called it our northern most military settlement. Our military is useless.
Your transitions into the ad part are getting more creative...
I'm Norwegian and the way he pronounces the cities is hilarious😂
I live in Toronto, anyone else?
I know this isn’t a “town”, but there is a Russian camp on the artic ocean, which is more further than Alert, Canada
all time time i thought the whole inverted shoe was Norway/Sweden/Finland \ndidn't know russia owned that part as well
Nice to see this on the trending list. More of this, please!
That Segway at the end tho 🤣
logic and sensibility doesn't exist in Russia. what in the fuck. am American, and fuck you
Hang on the most northern city in the uk would be Inverness not Edinburgh or even wick is further that Inverness??
This video is stolen
Toronto the northernmost? I hope this was just a joke and no one believes that, the US has entire states north of Toronto (Washington, Montana and North Dakota).
i get rly annoyed by the way he pronounces tromsø
You're more sarcastic than informative
Why would a Brit say Edinburgh?
Does it have Internet
After seeing this video, I was really excited with story blocks free trial and went for it and from the impression I got in the video I would be able to download many clips over the next 7 days and try out this amazing platform, but just after downloading a half a dozen clips or so I got a message saying I have exceeded the limit of video I could download during the trail, this limit wasn't explicit in your video or after clicking the link. I would like to know if anything can be done about this and if I could continue downloading stock footage
It's not too-lay\n\nit's a th sound like when you say through then ool like tool
I’ve been to Ny-Ålesund
Only British people aren't retarded enough to think Edinburgh is the northernmost town.
You can just decided to move to Svalbard. You are required to have a job  if you wanna live there and you need a permanent address somewhere else. When you retire you have to move.
Not only did he call Edinburgh a town he didnt realise that there is civilization above it seriously?
How about what is the southernmost Town in the world?
Just call it Long Year City, that's what it means
The transition to that sponsorship was not boring at all. That's pure marketing.
Already trending on this channel..Big things are to come
Thank you for the video! Ive always wondered whats going on the northernmost part of the world..
because logic and sensibility does not exist in Russia...\n\nhuh. it'll be The Northenmost World in Town
I wanna move to svalbard.
If you ask an American, the northernmost town in the world is probably Toronto, Canada.\n\n\n\nLmfao
The humour is great, and that segway into the ad was flawless
I live in Longyearbyen !!
To my bucket list
I really do not think anyone in the UK thinks Edinburgh is the northern most town. Its not even a town. I live further a lot north than Edinburgh.
1:43 gives me a cool fact:\n\nLongyearbyen saw totality in the 2015 total eclipse on March 20, but the same year the town suffered an avalanche.
Its called Tromsoe in english i come from Tromsø
I'm just happy Norway got mentioned in something
Really? Toronto? Even just sticking with Canada's 3 largest cities, Vancouver is further north. So are Ottawa (national capital), Montreal (other of the 3 largest), most of the other provincial capitals, and all of the territory capitals.
... Or you can move there and become a stupid YouTuber 😂😂😂😂
Edinburgh? Edinburgh's about 2 hours south of me and there's still a lot of towns further north. No Brit would answer Edinburgh.
One of best video
Want to know more about Svalbard? Check my video series, including a visit of both Longyearbyen and Ny Ålesund! Nils Svalbard Vlogs: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOJZhkzGissTkaRlZL9wKAePtoP3QnqBp
Other countries with 0 visa requirements?
I am watching this from Tromsø
Longyearbyen.. Hmm seems like a great place to retire
I enjoy and appreciate the work you put into these, but I'm driven to point out how bad the projection is on the main map you show in the video (and others, such as the Barrow video). It's ironic that you plug Storyblocks as a place to get graphics, but you don't consistently use a better map for talking about arctic places.
Well that's it longyearbean 😂 is the next germany now.
Now I know where I can flee to if ww3 starts.
That's really funny in social studies I did a project because in Canada we do Canadian geography you had to choose some place to research so I just looked around Google maps and I saw this place looks really north so I did A 300 word essay on alert just 4 days ago
'Thule' is pronounced too-lee. This fact took 3 seconds to research. Sorry, thumbs down.
I have to give it to Half as Interesting and Wendover Productions. The owner always manages to tie in the sponsors to the video topic perfectly. The videos are great as well.
You spend more time sponsoring than actually talking about the most northern town . How sad
So alert is the most northern settlement ever just not town. Cool
ur transition to advertising the sponsors is smooth AF
Why is Russia portrayed as the Soviet Union? @ 3:07
Um... aren't Villages and Towns different\nLike on Tiksi Wikipedia page it says: It remains the most Northernly Settlement with a population of over 5000
no logic in Russia What?
You're plug segways are next level on both channels lol
I am from New Jersey...work in Newark...I can confirm you don't want to end your day there.
Listen up here ya cunt, don't talk shit on Newark
I like how he actually told us he was going to name the town at the four minute mark and actually did it
Hahaha I live by Newark NJ and even the people there know its a dump. Its basically where New York dumps but it does have the largest port in America
Lol, I like how you went right back into the story blocks advertisement. Funny stuff man!!........ Great video though!!

Hallo fra tromsø (hello from tromsø)
I hate Mercator projection. Svalbard island looks like retarded.
Barrow is technically Utqiagvik now
Damn, that transition into the storyblocks promo
Wendover does it again
loved this
4:19 *cough* jakepaul *cough* sign me up!
How clever, putting NJ down
That ad integration tho.
Now do the southernmost one

I did not even watch the whole video as I know the northernmost town is Alert in Canada.
So ANYONE can just go to Svalbard and stay for as long as they want? Does Norway or anyone else have police or some sort of law enforcement over there? I mean does each and everyone of those settlements in Svalbard provide government services and the like in the language of the majority of the people living in those settlements or is it completely different?
the most northernmost town is actually Alert,Canada
The way he says Tromsø is funny
You CAN live in Alert as it's a city
My mom used to live an hour away from Murmansk!
Barrow AK ?
Larry has to be the most focused drumer in rock and roll.  No showboating or headbanging, his playing speaks for itself.
I like it! It's catchy and moody And great. If U2 wants to use I'm in the Tropipa Society for conceiving creative projects, they can! Same goes for others of my favorite famous people!
Looks like a Saturday Night Live intro
Its not a place.....
I want to be close to you like them, someday!!!!!
I love my state and city! I love NY 🇺🇸❤️😍
Should of sat on the steps of the Ritz. First USA show
I didn't like the song first time I heard it, but it's grown on me and now I sing it in the shower, I sing it in the car....you're the best thing about me!
Great great guitar riff !! The edge 👌🏻!South América ✊️
Beautiful music, congratulations U2 for another beautiful work.
Sick solo and bridge, Edge.
LOVE IT 😍 LOVE IT 😍 LOVE IT 😍 You are the best thing about me guys because you bring so much joy into my life with your music! Thank you! ❤️
the best band on the planet \n#U2 \ntks Bono Vox
As always great song,\nhope you can visit my Country with this Tour, more than welcome here in Costa Rica
*What a fucking nice looking video!*
I'm blown away.  I can't wait to buy this CD. I swear they only get better with age. Sing it BONO!!!!!!!!!
this song deserves so much more attention!
Yes thing new rola excellent i loved
Why can’t be more songs like this? Why
Guessing the crux of video is that u2 r not jaded
Anthony Bourdain is their new bass player XD
New York never looked so ugly U2 never sounded so hype. Tired of it!
Bono watches Muscle Russell Humble Your Soul on You Tube.
lET'S GO MILLONARIOS FOOTBALL CLUB AND U2
I totally love them but I am irritated by the way they lick America's ass. On the other hand, putting american flag into a video automatically means success at least with the mass of brainwashed american patriots, so I guess it's a kind of political move from their side..
I'm dying of excitement
I Love so much!!!
Wow.Great. Is a very, very good song. The vídeo is very Nice, not to comment that I do appear in the 2'12 at the right side of the image.
I CAN'T STOP LISTEN THIS MUSIC,U2 ALL GENERATION¡¡¡¡
U2 the best rcok band ever
Just an FYI:  In a mirror, you can only kiss yourself on the lips. 2:10
My guys are back!!! Edge stepping up on vocals!!!
NYC is a so great city...
U2 knows to create goosebumps to listeners and spectators but no wonder World’s biggest band !!!
SONGS OF EXPERIENCE SIGN ME THE FUCK UP

1:53 Bandera con escudo de Millonarios...
Every time I think they can't top themselves, they prove me wrong by releasing yet another steaming pile of potato-infused shit like this.
U2 exposed as a bunch of libtards. No thanks.
Shut the fuck up about Africa and just play One.\n- Liam Gallagher
A former long-standing fan... U2 needs to retire and spare us from their liberal narrative!
Always loved U2 but their last few albums have been boring. This isn't rock it's just drab pop music
1:53 the worst soccer team in Colombia.
Kinda tacky and disrespectful, if you ask me, you film a pop song video using the 9-11 Memorial of Lights as your backdrop. Plus the song kinda sucks.
copy & paste.. all because of you\nvery tired of all these new yorker celebrations
No spark. No inspiration.
cliché... c'mon guys
Boring.
Weak
This was great. I'm glad I found this channel, very relatable
1:30 FUCK
we have the same bday!
When I was 32 I went to Disney World for the fist time. Just saying.
Everyone needs a Grace Helbig in their lives, just sayin'.
Happy belated birthday!\n\nAlso, more Tim please. You two are so funny together. :)
HAPPY BIRTHDAY GRACE! GRATEFUL THAT YOU EXIST AND POST VIDEOS ON THE INTERNET FOR MY ENJOYMENT AND THAT YOU ARE VERY FUNNY AND FOR CAPS LOCK!!! <3<3

Great video! Happy Birthday Grace, you make my day better whenever I watch you. Thank you for that.\nAlso, the final expression in the video is precious.
Happy birthday! And also you should totally be a drag queen.

Happy belated birthday, Grace!!!
Happy Birthday! =)
Shouldve kepts #3 to yourself. It's disgusting to have a stank pussy and then you admit to have stink pussy. At 32 your pussy still stinks???? Thats DISGUSTING
Doesn't it suck not being good at processing emotion. To day someone told me the reason a helicopter had been hovering over my village was because some girl got drunk and tried to commit suicide by jumping into the harbour and my response is an awkward smile and saying well that was a great idea in a sarcastic tone....what is wrong with me. And when people tell me a problems all i can suggest is tea. And when I sign cards I can only think of really generic things to say because i'm really bad at sentimentality.  The weird thing is that I am actually a really caring person....i just don't convey it well.
Just one wicked Werdum knee on T-Ferg’s chin and he’s done like Lombard, when Hendo put his lights out...
I'll pay for that wall and build it with my own hands! Tony Ferguson
UFC fans should go back too WWE.\nWAAAAAAH WAWAWA WAAAAH beta
We're gonna just pretend like Werdum didn't just try to cut him off mid sentence?
Werdum switched to Spanish to Portuguese real quick! Guy is truly gifted with speaking all these different languages at one time lol
tony dark matter ferguson
Sou fã do werdum mano! Kkkkkk ele é sinistro!
Tony is a G.Real
Ferguson pau no cu do carajo!!!
Animo cukuy Ferguson
Tony Ferguson💪💪 goat
Fabricio bad energy werdum
Werdum would kill tony...
Ferguson=Honeybadger\n\nWerdum=Tiger
That douche
Weight classes, judges, ppv ruin the UFC
É isso aí werdum. Acabá com esse cu de cachorro kkkkkkk
Tony Black Energy Ferguson
Why is Tony Ferguson is built like Crash Bandicoot? lol
1:18 Ferguson to Werdum: Shut up before I ankle pick you!!\n\nYea good luck with that homie. \nLmfao
Werdum is right...Tony is different in front of camera...
Tony Fergunson is a great fighter.\nBut he acted like a douchebag on this one. He was the one who idiotically provoked this beef.
If you look close...Tony Ferguson has bigger hands than Werdum WTF???
why does verdum say i dont like bisping all the time
hold on I'm talking brother -- what a preppy, street thing to say. Some elements of hood in here.
Tony vs Werdum could have happened in the old UFC days.
I didn't know Kev is Mexican?!
If Werdum can beat Cain, he can easily swat Tony around.
Tony really trying to be Conor 😂
Verdum is a coward picking I fight with a smaller fighter
So what got in Werdums panties? Dude was more trigger then anything ive seen in awhile.
Tony is so Bs, he not even could make a point on the interview   After almost got crushed by Verdun, super funny 🤣🤣
he's channeling conor..lol.....why not.
LOL  I doe say nutin cause I'm heavy weight oh no
I don't like fake people coming from ferguson is the biggest irony ever
Werdum should slap ferguson for act like a punk.
have fun fighting on my undercard.    -Ferguson.
I think verdum has a ADHD problem, this guy is not matured
Ferguson doesn't think he's fake? He has one of the most affected, uncomfortable, personalities in the UFC. Everything about him is fake
Tony doesn't know how to speak Spanish
Tony looked like  a hobbit next to verdum. I like Ferguson and hope he wrecks Kevin Lee.
werdum would kill him in 10 seconds
aiai.. sou brasileiro...\n\ne achei a atitude do Werdum uma grande babaquice, tão ruim quanto à do outro idiota chamado Ferguson.\n\nComo dizia o poeta: o inferno e o cemitério estão cheios de valentões...'
Ferguson se acha a estrela... só que não ...
Whoa tony, easy man, thats werdum, the guy that subbed fedor and tuned up and subbed cain.
Kayate tu puta madre and he even didnt stand up wtf
Wolf tix
hehehehehehehehe
...tu puta madre maricon , hahaha, priceless!!!
I LOVE WERDUM!!!!!!!  CALLATE TU PUTA MADRE MARICON!! !^^
el cucuy
*Seu cu de cachorro* HSUAHSUAHUHAUSHUAHUSHAUSH
werdum the amazonian monkey
That size diferrence tho lol
FW would absolutely punish him lol
Lmfao bye Felicia I'm crying 😂 Ultimate scathing diss
This is clearly Setup 🤣😂🤣😂
Tony 'Dark Matter' Ferguson 🙃
Poker player vs Real Brazilian champ...hmmm)
Werdum picks on smaller guys to make himself feel better for that 1st round KO loss to p4p king #stiopic #immigrantmentality
Hahaha Ferguson is out of his mind. He looks stressed out for some reason, werdum can probably brake his arms and put him in coma in seconds.
Now I want to watch Kevin Lee and Derrick Lewis to win their fights for sure.
why did tony say that thing about kicking werdums ass there mustve been some background story here
Werdum would of killed his ass
I would have to go with werdum whooping his ass
Someone tell me what werdum was saying  please
I EMBRACE THE CRINGE GOD TONY
Haha one light jab from werdum and he would be asleep 😂 😂
Tony Ferguson vs Kevin Lee, the battle of the the Cringe. Who will take the cringey  throne and become the cringest of them all?
Hes lucky hes in the main event at ufc 216 .
Like sands through the hourglass so are the days of our lives.
These 2 idiots using the word maricon ( gay) as an insult in 2017....then they try to portrait MMA (which i am a fan for over 8 years now)  the UFC\n and their fighters like a sport ...omfg
It's good to know a little fame won't go to Tony's head...
Black Energy? Bad Energy?  Interesting claim coming from a Brazilian.
wait.. first thing he says is that he would beat werdum in a title match... then he says werfum is a big guy for picking a fight with a 155 pounder... which is it?
  I don't like fake people. So, take off the sun glasses.
He decided to become brave when the producer walked in. That's courage ladies and gentlemen.
Which part of Werdum is fake? You did not explain anything Tony.
is werdum mad that tony is cutting weight and getting himself into the zone? maybe tony aint got time for cuddles and tiramisu together dont get triggered u brazilian bitchboi
Have fun fighting on my undercard..... first insult that was not cringy
werdum is a shitbag. he told me not to speak English on periscope once. he wouldn't answer my question on periscope but he answered everyone else's.
Lol Tony talked first about a fight that's not possible
Where's the translation????
that is what you have to do if some one is being rude to you.  stand your ground. tony is may be 170  and werdum  245 .
Tony is a brilliant fighter but sometimes he just looses the yapping aspect of things.
Translation please? I would like to know what Werdum was saying.
have fun fight on my under card lmfao  tony... new respect
i would have thrown that towel on that clown cucui
A lot of Ferguson haters here it ain't that serious
Mcgregor is petrifed of Big Tony and John Kavanduck is looking for every easy fight to get him out of harms way.
Lol. I like tony. He can be a bit much though we seen that before. But good fighter. How ever tony knows exactly the jist of what werdum... He kinda got punked by the bigger dude. But that dont matter. I think tony will win vs lee unless he trys to be too wild n gets taken down then spends alot of energy. Who knows. Whatch lee get a ko... Hope its a crazy fight. After adrade vs gadelha alot of fighters got to step it up.
I like how he fights but Tony's a tool
So Ferguson says he'd kick Werdums ass if he had to. Werdum gets offended and mouths off. Then Ferguson plays the victim by saying Werdums trying to fight a small 155 pounder? I'm giving this one to Werdum.
Tony is the man! Much respect!
Fergunson parecia uma mosca cheia de marra kkkk, apenas levantou porque tinha outra pessoa no meio kkkkkk, queria ver ele por o dedo na cara do Werdum, Werdum ia coloca-lo dentro do copo de café kkkk, muita marra e ficou quietinho.
Funny thing is if ferguson was heavyweight he would destroy werdum
Tony u not even close to what verdum has achieved..SFU
That idiot should learn how to speak English  stupid no respect   have some class and be civilised  you stupid puta   English English English if you can't speak English don't speak rubbish lol lol lol looser
Get your act together guys, Werdum has a history of making dramas... He is all about respect blah blah blah...
Not sure how Ferguson is cringey. Yeah, the sunglasses are stupid, but that's it. If anybody is cringey in the ufc, it's Cody Garbrandt.
It was all good until the last one
But like... can we talk about what seems like STEVIE and DODIE HOLDING HANDS!!!
Jon is brilliant.  The audience, not so much.
He roasted Tf out of Shane.
HE REMEMBERED SHANANAY (sorry for all the posts. I’m freaking over here)
This was a hilarious bit...award show hosts are *supposed* to roast everyone. That's what happens at every other award show. So I give a big thumbs down to this audience but a huge thumbs up to Jon. So good!!!
Guys got guys, thanks for this
If he doesn’t host the streamys next year I’ll be so sad
He killed. He's definitely got a thing for comedy.
1:40 NED !!! WHERE'S EUGENE AND KEITH AND ZACH
I was half expecting P A I N T SUBSCRIBE at the end
In memorium \n\n\n- those are my friends
The audience were so dry, but I think that's partly the camera persons fault. If they had shown all the people, you would have seen their reaction, because if you go to dodie's twitter, she was laughing, they just didn't catch it on camera
This is so awkward
3:11 Tessa Brooks is that you?\n*NEXT TO DODIE*
Omg omg omg DYING! I havent laughed out loud this hard in quite some time. I LOVE Jon Cozart lol!!
WHY DID NO ONE LAUGH AT THE BLACKFACE PART IT'S FUCKING TRUUUUUEE
This is pretty funny. But this is just seems so awkward.
BRING HIM BACK NEXT YEAR
When this is the only way you will get to see Jon cause he never posts...
he's part of my childhood because I watched the Disney songs he did
HE DIDN'T HOLD BACK AND I LOVE THAT.
I need more songs from Jon. His voice is international
My roast to PAINT:\nWhy are you here? You technically aren't even 2017 youtuber what chu doing up here. The last video you made was about the 2016 election get a life or learn to edit.
Pls don't talk about shay Carl they are going through a lot
sc and insta stories do the same thing just one did it first now they prefer the other tru
put this man on broadway
Awwwwww Shane and sugar pine 7 in the same room at the same table my life has been completed I'm dead
I'm not even mad at that Tyler Oakley roast because it's definitely true. 😂
I LOVE JON SO MUCH
Some say he ran away after this song....
OH SHOOT JON WHO HURT YOU
The audience was so butthurt
WHY ARENT PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE LAUGHING IM WHEEZING
Jon has just been gone for so long then he comes out of the blue with this savagery
This is why I love Jon
Lmao Shane was laughing at his callout but Ryland was almost offended on his behalf
Can someone explain the shane dawson roast? I dont get it
I don't think the audience realized that he was satirical in his MOST OF THEM ARE NEW YORK BEST SELLING AUTHORS DON'T YOU READ and the audience cheered cuz they thought he was complimenting them haha
THE SHANE DAWSON PART KILLED ME😂😂😂😂😂😂
hAHAHAAHAHAHA this is the best thing
I like how Mamrie said motherfucker I'm gonna get you
DAMN! NEED SOME ICE FOR THAT BURN, SHAY?
I feel bad for Shane. That was completely uncalled for and kinda uncomfortable
Jenna sitting next to Ned makes my life better
this was fire but the shay carl thing was really insensitive ):
THAT SHANE DAWSON ONE WASNT EVEN A ROAST BUT A FULL ON DRAGGGG
Why does this make me angry a lil like god damn you did it Jon
I love this guy! \o/
Man fuck that crowd ! This was funny smh
AFTER HE SAID THE SHANE JOKE IT JUST FELT SO AWKWARD OML JON NO
This is why I love Paint
Ok I just clicked because it said that he roasts lilly and liza and o hate both of them. It wasn't too strong of a roast though. He could have done better roasting them too
“The chipotle queso of award shows” I’M DEAD TOO TRUE
he’s coming for the tony’s
I get a feeling that Jon didn't want to be there.
That Shay Carl bit I think was the most savage
The audience is dead 😂😂
It wouldn't have been half as awkward if Jon didn't do that nervous toothy laugh after his jokes
That was good. I couldn't stop laughing
I understand all of this and I'm loving it
It seems everyone here forgets that not everyone finds the same jokes funny. Believe it or not people have different tastes. Shocking! :)
Get you a friend that reacts like Mamrie at 2:40
You can feel the chill in the air... \nYouTubers soooo hate each other...
I wish this happened at the Oscars.
You go Jon, this was hilarious because it's true! Good god those youtubers need to remove the sticks from their asses because they're so f-ing stiff and awkward. A streamy isn't even a real award, it's nothing to brag about if you win. The author joke though! So true! I'm willing to bet that not even half of those best selling authors read in their free time. And they only became bestselling because their fans buys everything with their name on it - doesn't matter if it's good or not. I feel for those new authors that are trying to sell books without being a youtuber
I just became a fan of this guy
This is amazing
He mentioned Dodie yooooo goals
i love him
The Host goes skrrrrraa
he looks so scared my gosh
JON MENTIONED DODIE FUCK
gay
DODIE!! OMG SHE WAS NEXT TO TESSA OMG HAHAHAHAHA
lmao adapt and rug at 1:09
YEEEESSSS! SLAAAAY!
Jon is amazing
This was fucking hilarious
CONNOR DJNDJFBD
Jesus fucking Christ
damnn
Mametown’s reaction was hilarious
Beautiful.\nTrue art.\nPaint is awesome.
Omg this was amazing 😂😂🙌🏼
Hannah Harto & Dodie's reactions were priceless XD
Brooooo he ROASTED THEM OMFGGGGG
that was amazing
I LOVE JON
Really funny
Mamries pissed
THE ROUSTS ARE AMAZING
Jon Cozart is clearly far too woke.
THIS GOT ME FUCKED UP
HOLY HELL JON THOSE ROASTS WERE HELLA SAVAGE 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wow rip everyone
0:21 racist white boy
THIS IS GOLD!
OOOOOHHHH ROASTED!!!
Boom roasted.

Amber girl!!! You’re great, luv ya toots!! So happy for you xoxo
Thank you for everything, Amber! When I started watching this channel I hated myself for the way I looked, for the fact that I didn’t do anything to change it. But you made me realise that if I want to be a queen, I just have to see myself as one. You inspired me to try out makeup, to treat myself with stylish outfits, to dye my hair and I cannot thank you enough because I’ve come to a point where I feel completely comfortable in my skin and have the self confidence I’ve always wished I had. Thank you so much and congratulations on the 1 million! You deserve it!
Please please don't change, stay U... thats what keeps us engaged. God bless u, congrats 🍾
love you amber 😘😘⭐⭐⭐congratulations now its time to start that shoe line sis keep up the good work !!!
We all love you ❤️❤️ omgg I am crying 😍😭
Dear amber,\nYou most likely not see this but it’s worth a shot. I’ve been watching you for almost a year and you made me believe I could be a YouTuber. You’re so fun and genuine, every time I watch one of your videos I feel like we’re close friends. You don’t let one little lense change your personality. Also I love you so much and you are so beautiful. If I could only count how many times you have saved one of my outfits, we’d be here for years. But anyway thank you for always being yourself and helping me believe I can do it. Love you!!\nah, but what if it does!\n-Ce’Ve💗
Amberrrrrrrrrr We love you so much 😘😘😘  Since 1k subs.......😙

Congrats amber *hugs*
So, pay Amazon to watch you have sex?
they should kill the bezels
the goal of modern living is simplicity, not more gadgets
150$ ??!! No thanks
Great job CIA 😀👌🙌🎆🎉🔥
hi i'm Casey, and this is 90 seconds on the verge
Amazon wants camera and mic in every room of the house
I want this as a center console in a Mini Cooper
Great now the NSA can see me sleeping !!
free video calls to amazon corporate headquarters and the NSA.  just press nothing.
Yay an alarm clock that uses electricity!! That's a game changer!
what a load of rubbish
Its going to look so hot with s big piece of black tape on the camera. I'll sit it right next to the fan I have with matching black tape on the blue light that shoots out of it.
Yea if i buy one, the first thing i will do is put a tape on the front facing cam. \n\nIt would be nice if companies would think about actually making some kinda lid on the camps their integrate into their products, \nso people would have a choice, so people dont have to destroy the design of the thing with a ugly table. \n\nBuy hey, first world problems..
Amazon need to stop stealing others ideas, like this one:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufR8uJAAw0&t=
I will not put that magic 8 ball w/ a camera in my bedroom. \n\nAlso I wonder how many ppl do video calls. Anecdotally idk anyone. Curious if the rest of population does regularly enough to buy this. They must if Amazon if Amazon is betting on it
This is almost what I wanted... but for something to really be an alarm clock it needs to have a backup battery.  I used my dot as an alarm clock for awhile, but the first time the power went out and my alarm didn't go off, I had to stop using it.
That THING looks like a color iMac! Amazon devices are REALLY FAT-Show, Spot, Tablets EVERYTHING.\n\nThat's why they only show front views of the Show.
Amazon wants a bunch of these in homes. The price needs to be $50 less then.
So 100 dollars less than a spot?
I want one. But can't even pre-order it in the UK. Probably won't get it until Spring.
Would be nice if it had a phsical camera cover
Is amazon going to offer some kind if trade in upgrade for people with old alexas
I'm distracted by his tiny head.
I have a phone.
Not to be confused with the nVidia Spot, which is scheduled to come out.... someday, they think.\nhttps://www.nvidia.com/en-us/shield/smart-home/
Cool device with an attractive pitch and design, but Amazon's ecosystem doesn't appeal to me at all, and it's not available in all countries.
I would buy that for a dollar
love it. need to get it. available yet?
i thought we developed smartphones in order to get rid of alarm clocks...
Why would anyone want that wire tap in their house?
Okay, of all of the echo products so far, this one (to me at least) looks the most futuristic of the bunch. I don't even use Alexa or any smart home appliances for that matter, but I want it anyway
one in the kitchen, bedroom, and living room? yeah no thanks. and you know why...
Looks cool but always listening is becoming always watching...
Looks nice but Alexa can’t answer some very basic questions. Would love to see this hardware with google assistant intelligence.
0:48 indeed, a good clcol amazon echo spot is
The dot next to my computer keeps waking up to this
one in the bathroom?
So pretty much a device that does everything my smartphone already does.  I think I'll pass.
Probably most appealing thing in the line-up more affordable price, small modern form-factor, and it has the luxury of a screen + all the features of a regular echo.
FREE video calls?!? No freaking way!
don't put that in bedroom
Imagine Alexa in your bedroom listening to you sleep...
This is my favorite eco but I’m not buying it since amazon have information to the government about people talking to the eco
Not sure about having a camera next to my head while I'm sleeping.  Believe it or not, I obviously LOVE tech....emmm emm my tech review channel :).  However, when it's time to sleep I want absolutely NO TECH in my bedroom, including my phone.
Does youtube work on it?
WALLS HAVE EARS! AND YOU'RE PAYING FOR IT!
I wonder why they didn't make the screen bigger. Should have went with a 3 screen
Wow now that's cool
new product from CI... i mean amazon 😊
I think this is the most interesting of the new devices but it's real potential is lost to me when it doesn't keep a charge for like lets say the power goes out...    Then it's not a dependable alarm clock.
Who wonna trade vid clips on this 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Any idea if the display can turn off?  Asking for the clock in a bedroom use case.
Has anyone ever told Alexa to shut up
Coming Soon: Amazon Cool Beans- an alexa enabled refrigerator, specifically designed for beans. starts at 1299
Why would you want a camera on it?
My Echo kept going off during this video lmao
Doesn't this one look too similar with the upcoming smart speaker by the essential?
too pricey, $75 per an we got a deal
It's a buy and a great deal.. can't wait for the knock off version
This looks cool but has personal data breach written all over it. -no thanks.
So it does nothing my phone can't do.
Put one in your bedroom huh? then don't forget to cover the camera or turn it around whenever you're pleasuring yourself, cause you just never know who's watching.........
South Park should had waited to make that Alexa episode how funny whould this be if they mocked the fact that this thing has a camera on it
Ah, great...  A camera next to my bed
When I first saw it in the thumbnail I thought, dang nest made a virtual assistant... NICE... oh dang it’s amazon.
The amount of times this video triggered Alexa...
These devices are great epitomes of consumerism.
How come Amazon sucks at making products.
Bedroom
Makes me miss my Chumby.
Should have included wireless charging
meh.
たけー
Nest Alarm Clock
Gayy
Its pretty elegant
Typo at 0:48
A smart alarm clock? Nice.
Make Alexa Great Again #MAGA
STOP saying ALEXA! lol
Djmario sube el CAMINO!!
Nexus Q, anybody?
I want it
Wait until edward snowden see this..
To all who are commenting that this echo spot will now be able to hear you and see you in your bedroom. Hope you morons realize you carry your phones everywhere.
Just as a word of advice to some of the people commenting, here's a hint: ANYTHING with a camera or a microphone connected to the internet can be used by the government to watch you. Your phone, any microphones you have connected to your computer, webcams, all of that can be used to watch you. So, can the government watch you through this? Yes. Of course they can, and I'm sure they probably will. But they can also watch you at all times when you're on your phone or your laptop watching this video. It isn't new information, people. Yes, these devices can be used to watch you, but anything connected to the internet with some kind of recording device can be used to do that. The only difference is that this is a smart alarm clock. Doesn't matter.
Is there anyway that if you had one in your kitchen, in your living room, on your desk, and in your bedroom that you can link them and use them as home surveillance?
Got Siri, I don’t need this weird spyware thing too.
What usefully those devices do? Other than stealing your data.
I'd pay $20 for this glorified photoframe.
this is pretty cheap so idk why people are complaining
The end was cringeworthy.
I'm with Google..
putting an internet connected smart device with a good front facing camera in your bedroom? Grrreeaat idea!
But does it have an aux out port. If it does I'd totally get one.
Need more hot girls\nlmao
I want one
130 is way too expensive
The issue with this is that an alarm clock needs 100% reliability. What if there is no power or WiFi. Does it have back up power and does the clock work fully with no internet. Does it go down sometimes.  On a regular Echo none of this matters, but it does on an alarm clock. That has to work every single time, with no exceptions ever.
I really like that this video wasn't just about buying loads of new stuff 🙌
I love the mirror selfies!
For the instagram: I like a mix of both. Everything doesn't have to be perfect
Hey not one to comment but I love the mirror pics and selfies, I think your casual but chic posts set you apart from all the overly polished content online, plus those type of posts make it a bit easier for me to imagine how I could actually wear such looks in day to day to life. Just love seeing the looks you put together really, so keep doing what you're doing and whatever you enjoy the most ❤️❤️
I love your fashion videos!!
I prefer mirror pictures because they are more accessible and I feel like I could relate to that style of picture more.
Sammi I love your style! You're so good at putting outfits together that flow really well!
I love your fashion videos! they're always super helpful!
I remember watching you when you wore your Docs and chunky shoes. Bring em back! =) Love watching your videos as alway, Sam. You brighten my day.
This earrings suits you soo much Sam! I 'm waiting for some ootd videos! xx
Loooooove the earrings Sammi!
Reds & sequins not for me👎
I love you!
You should release a red jumper with Novem & Knight!!!!
Girl first of all this was amazing, you are amazing! I love your videos to the moon and back, truly! And to answer your question I actually like the mirror pics more than the professional shots (although those are marvelous too) as I feel like they're a bit more charming and relatable. So much love to you and your lovely family! xxx
ive been a subscriber since ur doc martens days omg!! time flies!!!!
You look so stunning in this video!
I just want to go out buy so much more clothes than what I was already thinking about! Love this video!
Shout out to everyone that remembers Sam killing it in Doc Martens back in the day.
What i love about your fashion videos is that it inspires me to be braver with my own personal style. Now i'll actually take the plunge and wear something i like even if it's a bit out there and it's a great feeeling  xx
Love love love your fashion videos ! And i dont mind both for your outfit photos. Love checking out your instagram stories about your outfit and Indie as well ❤️
I really like your hairstyle like that ☺️
Loved all the pieces but the sequins blazer was my favorite😍
I've just seen that Zara has a quilted scarf. That might be a way to get the puffy bomber look without being overwhelming. #teampetite
I've just bought an oversized grey/brown check blazer and i love it but have no idea how to style it! any suggestions?
I like this kinda neutral sage green or slate blue color on stove pipe dress slacks. The pants are kinda high waisted with deeper pockets and are worn with a rugged boot. I kinda like the professional Instagram photos.
I love your style, you are and have been for years an inspiration to me <3\nI prefer more laid back insta pictures! They are so much more authentic :)
where is that lovely red floral tea dress from ? x
WHAT LIPSTICK IS THAT?! You're always, always, always SO gorgeous
Love videos like this!
I think Polka Dots are also a thing this season !!! I see them every where & instead of red , maroon jumpers is a huge trend !!! Goes go well with the checkers x planning to do something like this on my blog soon !
I think a variety is good, but I prefer selfie, mirror pictures. It's nice to see more selfies and mirror pictures just to remember that you are just a normal person like your followers. A lot of fashion YouTubers are leaning more towards the professional side of things and sometimes it's nice to be able to relate to you on some level, if that makes sense!
This is awesome video. Great creation\nif you want to like this just come to My channel and subscribe my channel.\nhttps://youtu.be/fz9cEb_6fl4\nCreate a good comment and like my video\nhttps://youtu.be/qk-ekQuK2Gk
The check print is called Glen plaid (which is short for Glen Urquhart plaid) or Glenurquhart check
I love these videos Sammi!! And I love how excited you are, it makes me so excited to shop too - you're so bad for my bank balance! xx
I like seeing both for sure but more mirror pics!
I like both! Sometimes I like to see something really pro and full of effort, but sometimes it's nice to just see a regular person taking a regular photo in front of a mirror! (Possibly stuck all the crap things in the room to where you can't see in the pic.)\nLove you!!
The red jumper and skirts with oversized sweaters are my favourites! 😍 Love it. \nAnd I'm loving your lipstick, your hair and your shirt in this video. 😍😍 You always look so good! \nLoved the video 💕
The kitten heel... it's a no from me 🙈
Loving these videos on upcoming trends and how to incorporate them!
Love love loved this! I feel so inspired now thank you! x
You look gorgeous!! Where is your necklace from?
Right before you said it I was thinking those trousers would look good with a red jumper 😂  I've also seen a lot of extremely pointy boots out and about but they look kind of clown-ish to me 🤷‍♀️
I love how down to earth you are! Professional pics are neat, but mirror pics are definitely more relatable and are still great!
Definetly the mirror selfies, they just have this effortless and casual feel to them. Whereas the more professional shots are a little more clean cut. \nDoes that make sense? Lmao. \nBoth are stunning though!
This is your best makeup look! 💄
love the format of you vids sami
This filming background is SO nice 😍
Sammi you'll love this site for all these trends! https://imaginebykim.nl/collections/newin
You're makeup looks amazing in this video! That lip is everything!
No disrespect but other than the 40s blue and the red autumnal boots most of the other pieces reminds me of the story ‘the emperors new clothes’, kinda.
I would LOVE to have this grey jumper!!! I even wanted it last year.. but shipping to germany and from pounds to euro is just toooo expensive for just one jumper.. I wait till payday or you post a coupon code :D:D
very good video! so put together and insipring! thank You! so professional, Sammy!
hi where is your gold lamp from?! :)
Love this! I'm pregnant with twins and seriously don't know how I'm going to find anything in trend for my growing body, knowing colours and patterns will really help! Also I love your selfie posts 📸 xx
I like a combination of professional photos and selfies! They both show something different :)
Im not into any of those trends. Except red bc it's my favourite colour. But i dont get the trend of the biiiig jackets/coats and wide shoulders. And shiny clothing ugh \nTbh i personally think it's not important to follow trends. It's better to build a solid wardrobe and then maybe buy a few pieces here and there and personalise everything
Try reserved for a red jumper! They have the nicest roll neck xxxx
Are those bomber jackets? Most of the pictures you showed are puffa jackets
Where is that red flower dress from @ 8:27?  I can't find it in the discription box :(
👍🇺🇸🇬🇧🇺🇸🇬🇧💞💕💞💕💞💕💞💤💤💤💤💤💤🌐 you have beautiful hand Sammy I got interrupted the first time I washed your blog great blog as usual Kansas City Missouri
I love the look of your N&K jumper but it doesn’t say what it’s made of......could you let me know? X
Love that red is in! This was a really helpful run down, loved it 💗🍂
Hey Samantha, if you're worried about the oversized bomber trend not suiting your short frame (same tbh) Ariana Grande has been known to wear them from time to time and she is next level tiny! You may have already seen it since it's a little old now but check out her music video for Everyday for some inspo. Not a plug but shorties like us can definitely pull off all the trends too!
always enjoy your fashion videos :) I like both types of instagram pics - I think it's good to have some of both as it keeps it looking sophisticated but real
Hi Sam, personally I like a mix of professional shots and mirror pics, but I also like whatever gets us more outfit pictures!
I bought a bright red scarf yesterday and I am in love! Such a good way to get a bit of colour for someone who's scared of deviating from monochrome!
As for Instagram I really like a good mix of both !!
Love your style !!! You are such an inspiration
I love the top you're wearing with the red lipstick! Selfies, and mirror outfit pics are my favorites for your Instagram because it feels more real.
Love you sammi! I always love your fashion videos
the puffy bomber is one of my favourite wardrobe pieces cause it instantly makes your outfit trendy
Loving statement earrings on you! You look great in this video.
Hi Sammy! You're looking gorgeous! I loved the video but I think you shoud have mentioned the vinyl trend and showned your H&M skirt, I have one too and I'm in love with it :D!! Love from Portugal XXx
Hey Sam, sorry just seen Jason uploaded a podcasts with you.. I'll be back ☝️😊
Your just delightful to watch ❤
Love this video! More please! ♡
Also, just watching old vids and realized how much I miss the kaleidoscope intro!
Mirror pics!! <3
Selfie pics for sure 😊
LOVEEEEE THESEEEE VIDEOSSSSSS
The shirt, the hair-do, the red lip- just GORGEOUS!
You're glowing!
I smell karenbritchick !!!
Selfie outfit pictures <3
definitely prefer your mirror / selfie outfit shots :)
Casual mirror pics
Piece piece piece piece piece cool  piece piece
LOVVVEEEE your style!!❤️
You looking nice ❤️
i prefer your non-professional pics on insta
I loveee the winter maxi/midi dresses
Your makeup looks great!!
Your eyebrows be poppin
Always my no.1 fashion guru! X
Love everything apart from the kitten heels, im never going to be able to jump on that fashion train! x
KITTEN VEEL VERSION oh my god a died Sam 😹😹😹
I love these type of videos! 💕
ugh you're so chic yet unique at the same time! loved this video so much. the outfit with the sequin blazer had to be my fave 😍😍😍
I don't know what it is about this video, but I LOVED it ❤️ I feel like you're the one fashion YouTuber I watch who is so passionate when you talk about fashion - such a joy to watch!
It is a mental game, he is getting in the head of the other team
He just wants to get some camera time...BVB really should look into upgrading in his position though.
How have I never noticed this?
If only he'd be as keen to get his hands on the ball when it comes flying at him in the middle of a match.....
He's the best 🖤💛
That is weird but whatever works

Irgendwie Süss wie er den Schiri weg drückt
Er war bestimmt mal balljunge :D
That last sokratis part 😂😂😂
Immer dieser bürki
Haha was macht der jung:)
Bin zwar Bayern Fan,aber finde das Bürki ein guter,erfahrender und Sympathischer Typ ist 😂💪🏼
Neuer macht das vor jedem Spiel genau wie Fährmann es auch vorher so gemacht hat bevor er Kapitän wurde.
ICH SAG NUR KURZE ECKE
Der soll mal lieber seine kurze Ecke zu machen
Ist alle schüsse am kurzen eck reinlassen auch ein ritual von ihm?
Bürki ist Top und passt perfekt zu BvB
Vor einem Dortmund Video Bayer Werbung ?!? Nice!!!
Nur das das Neuer schon gemacht hat bevor Bürki schon bei Dortmund gespielt hat
Das beste ist bei 0:32😂😂😂😂
Schon aufgefallen,aber gibt es eigentlich einen Grund?😂
Neuer macht das auch
Richtig lustig. Habe mich vor lachen weg geschmissen.
Ach man der roman
Wo der Schiri ihm bei 0:44 schon automatisch den Ball zurollt 😂
😂😂😂Und dann noch diese Musik im Hintergrund
Der will nur nochmal den Luftdruck prüfen, dann hätte er ne gute Ausrede, wenn er mal wieder einen reinlässt. ;-)
So geil weil die musik sehr gut passt
Wer Hat den Ball von  schiri geklaut???\n\nBürki hat den Ball von schiri geklaut wer ich niemals 😎😎😎!!!!
Wenn der Bürki immer den Ball will dann könnte er doch als Balljunge bewerben:D
Zum glpck macht das nicht neuer schon sein Leben lang
Bringt ihm ja nicht sonderlich viel, wenn er die letzten Spiele fast jeden Ball der auf die Torwartecke geht nicht halten konnte
I LOVE THIS TEAM!!!!!!
Bin ich der einzigste der das gerade zum erstenmal mitbekommt ? 😂
Und hält trotzdem nichts
BAYERN DIE SAMA MIA \n\nFOREVER FCB
Unnötiges Video
Ich bin kein bvb fan aber das ist echt lustig ps:Ich bin fcb Bayern fan
Nothing beats days like this :) Thanks for being a huge part of everything we do. Smile More :)

I’m from Texas
You're friends with my aunt Carly and my mom and cousin Ben and then my uncle Uncle Chris did you know that they said you were friends with them
Hey roman I just wanted to give out my feeling right now but I am extremely extremely sad right now because I lost a pet this morning that was the most cutest and smartest pet i ever had. Her name was tilty and she was a guinipig. Her head was tilted when she was born so it stayed like that. She would squeal at you if she was telling you a story or if she was hungry or thirsty. This morning I realized something was wrong with her and she wasn't really squealing or moving. I picked her up and she was breathing but she couldn't lift her head. So I put her down and she would walk just seemed very weak and she couldn't lift her head. So my mom being as amazing as she is she brought her to work with her and as she was picking me up from daycare she died. I had a really hard time since they only live a year or 2 and her cage was in my room. We are going to Barry her at my grandmas tomorrow.😭😭
that was rude really grass haha like texas grass dead grass
roman you should put a spoiler on the suit case kart
Aww. My brother is a month older than her (I'm ten) And he's waaaaayyyy to lazy to hold is head.

At 22 min. How do airplanes do that... It is actually ice crystals that make up the contrail \nEngine puts out hot air and it is about 60 below so the moisture in the air is heated becomes saturated then freezes almost instantly what's even cooler is sitting in last row on a 777 and actually able to see them freezing while sitting next to them 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

&he's trying to make a baby...
Everything that comes out his mouth sounds like a lie lol
Ray J's stuck in 2011 with 3 cups sipping nothing.
Ray J is very delusional very
Has anybody noticed that this fake ass tech mogul, fake ass rapper,fake ass celebrity is faking drinking lean.
I TOLD YOU 5 seconds later... yeah im humble.
Damn it's fucked up how they were reaching for dirt the whole interview SMH
The reason why I like the breakfast club is cause they ask the question people want to ask . This guys just go searching for a story even if they aren’t interested
Like a smaller Mike rashid
Ray j is a busta
ClickBait at it's finest
Joe thinks he's profound in all he says
Brotha Ray J is high as a kite
Who would take a beef with ray j serious lol
Make this the last y’all Clickbait 💯
are we all gonna act like we haven't seen this man's dick?
11:10 the realest sh@t you ever heard, take that advice. Ray J is an OG now.
15:49 what the hell happens to Akademiks' voice?
I keep hearing Vince Staples voice saying everything we love and care about revolve around RJ
Nigga made some good songs though ..everybody had 'one wish' on their phone at one time
Rip To the niggas that always have to say they're faithful...when nobody asked lol🙏
I don't know it's something about this show that it's super trash to me  like I could be sitting on the set and fall right asleep😴
All these rappers have the same story when they get caught up in some shit quick to blame shit on drugs..
he sipping sprite on the rocks with no pharmaceuticals and got that bitch triple cupped for no reason lol
Joe the kinda nigga that still buys fitted caps.
Ray j either sounds real humble or real broken?
Lean don't make me act like that
I may have gave this a view, but anyone who spoke after 0:03 seconds is straight garbage
If he ain’t talking about Kim and her life.. his so irrelevant
Joe, you don't understand California, there are helicopters everywhere. At least in the cities - Oakland and LA. Very different than the east coast.
Complex, Click Bait titles that aren't truthful diminishes your integrity.
Why do these overrated artist with one or two hits think they're so relevant and impact is so strong. U acted like a fool your whole career ray j.
If you like being introduced to new artist and new music as well as interacting subscribe to our channel
11:10 the realest shit I've ever heard someone say... like Vince Staples said, Ray J can never take an L
From what I see weed and/or lean just make you calm & jus bring up all ya honesty.
Ray J is always so funny 😂 he's a cool cat lol.
niggaz be so pressed to show they sipping lean these guys goofy
Damn... im feelin this new ray j
He spitting straight facts! Take yourself to the next phase in life and don't take money for fuck shit.
Wow, they're sucking him the fuck off, lame episode
This nigga is such a complete fuck boy...he is a  tech guy  now visiting  silicone valley. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ray J matured. Complex wit the clickbait. This my first dislike
Ray J and Kanye have to be related!
The sprite bottle is probably blurred out because they don’t wanna give sprite free promotion.. that’s why sometimes rappers shirts or certain labels will be blurred out in their video
Is Ray J a football fan? https://goo.gl/N6ruJc
I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE ACTUALLY COMPARE THIS DRY ASS LAME SHOW TO THE BREAKFAST CLUB ! ??? LMAO 😂😂😂
I'm humble. - Ray J\n\n😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bye Bitches! LOL ladies this is what a professional liar sounds like

Free John Gotti\nFree John Gotti\nThe king of New York\nThe king of New York
Yeah I'll give it a go.
Make a movie about Mad Sam!!!
Love John but he ain't the guy for this part..........Seriously.......
A Scientologist funded movie starring some of the high ranking cult followers fuck this
Travolta does not look like Gotti? So what? Anthony Hopkins did not look like Nixon either. Travolta is gay? So what? It's all in the acting. Why do they make so many movies about gangsters? Because there are no kings or kingdoms anymore, that's why. Politicians are boring,  and so are bureaucrats. If Shakespeare were around today, he'd do the same. Don't believe me? Then why did he write about so many corrupt or evil kings? Was he exploiting them, trying to entertain audiences, or making moral points? I don't care what your answer is. If you don't like it, don't watch it.
Not watching this POS film.
I feel like this story has been told before. Fuck it, I love mafia shit. I'll watch it.
it's like he got done of up playing shapiro in the oj thing, then broke away, a little makeup adjusment and bam, john gotti on the set.....
No way this fag play in the boss of bosses
This looks pretty good. John Travolta has an actual decent haircut without any ridiculous facial hair. I swear he signed up to do every role that had funky hair. Grease, Swordfish, From Paris With Love, Killing Season, Pelham 123.
Vinnie Barbarino as Gotti? Not in a\n million years!
Soooooooo, they made it a comedy?
The Mafia genre has us in a Love Hate relationship, it's entertainment we can't refuse.
This rip off will never be as good as the Godfather
John Travolta is a hideous actor. Vinny Barbarino plays a mafia boss.  I can't wait to miss it.
No thanks, I'll stick with the Armande Assante version, travolta is like cruise, WAY overrated.
Gotti must be rolling in his grave knowing a gay man is playing him!
I would consider Ray Liotta for this role......an American-Italian actor.
John Travolta looks like shit. Whitefolks don't age well at all.
Why are the worst of people always the first to be idolized in a motion picture?
Alot of man-animals getting whacked in the movie.
They need to make a movie on don  Carlo Gambino.... Whoops they already did. The godfather movie .... Just couldn't use likeness.  This movie looks interesting.....Gotti  the real man was a legend .. a man's man..  wacked out  the acting  boss.. and  became the boss.. .. now  you all know who the real last Boss is.. with  dirty double crosss....
why would this clown play the part? Cmon kid.....he doesn't even look like goti.
That was just terrible casting.
Love john travolta can't wait to see it!
Travolting as Gumba Gotti... Lame and not believable. A gay guy playing a Mob guy doesn't work
wow i can't believe yo gotti got a movie about him
Been awhile since a good crime movie has released, looking forward to it, welcome back Travolta!
They should of ask Caitlyn Jenner to play this role, what's the difference? Travolta and that baby 🚼 voice, toupee, Botox face. This movie is going to suck.
Funny how John Gotti looks a lot like Robert Shapiro.
What Italian wants a closeted gay Bavarian man playing them? Italians are never gay or this butt ugly as all these actors.
heres another stupid fucking movie from hollywood. shake that city up!
I will withhold comment until I see the movie!!!! BUT I do like John Travolta!!!
trying to make this generations godfather hope it is good
Well jjust watched the movie in this trailer thanks (:
Whats the music on on the begining?
dumb, I like mob movies, but the movie has stupid writin all over it👎
All I see is a bunch of saggy old fat faces! LOL John can do better.
Don't hit the hair! — famous John Gotti quote o_O
You'll need the support of all five families cliche and then goes onto name them like someone forgot🤣🤣
Don't ever fuck with me. Dumb shits. That's to you mob
Amazing how they look up to the white gangsters but call black men thugs doing the exact same shit. This country is full of hypocrisy to the point nobody believes the bullshit anymore. Not even us. Americans try n tell everybody else what they issue is and we are all fuked up.  This country has a I'm written rule. Do the crime. Just don't get caught. Cause then we make a example out of u. Meanwhile the biggest people in charge in this country have some of the worst habits and addictions poor people have.  Yet they are never told on exploited embarssed or exposed. That happens to the black people. Even poor white people have it better then us. At least they can clean up and act the part. If your white n poor in American your a fuk moron that deserves poverty.  The entire country is set up for u to win.  Black kid plays with you gun outside and is killed like a dog. White kid shoots up a church full of blacks.  Not only is he caught without being killed. They brought him cheese burgers.  Lmaoooooo that's the hate white people have for blacks. Read the comments under Travon Martins stories you tube. This country hates anything black unless it have a team jersey on scoring points or singing and dancing for u pale face peices of individual shits. And we need to hate them back. They hate so they win. The can piss in a bottle and call it champagne.  If we piss in a bottle it's just piss. And I'm sick of the double standard.  But that will all b over soon enough.  The old ways and old people are dying. What was the minority last year won't b soon. I wonder how blacks will treat whites in 50 years. I pray it's at least a fraction of the hospitality that has been shown to us. Since the first aboriginal was killed on this land along with the slaves brung from Africa.  I hope that dept is paid back times 20. But I can only wish for something in the same category my ancestors felt while being whipped shot killed chased down and hunted by you people. I will never bite my younger when it comes to how I feel about u people. Like Rich Piana called magic Johnson a filthy nigger. For what? But when the racist bastard died they tried to make him some beautiful person. Fuk him dead n alive. He was a racist fuk yard. Yet everybody tried to say no big deal. He don't feel like that anymore and it was years ago. Such bullshit.  Pure bullshit
Kinda wish they had thrown in KG's jhon gotti song
What tf has he done to his face
I think John Travolta should stop dying his hair and wearing a toupee.
William Forsythe did a great job as Sammy the Bull in the HBO version. I'm curious to see how William DeMeo does in the role.
HBO One is good but must see if there messed it up or made it better I think the old one has better Italian accents thoe
John There Volts in game bichis
I remember recording the HBO Gotti movie on vhs back in 1996 classic material hope this movie stands up to it going to see it
Until Travolta speaks out about the abuses of Scientology, I won't see his movies.  As much as I do love organized crime stories and 70s disco.
Hey Travolta we need someone to play your wife in the movie. Know anyone?\n\nNo. O wait... Maybe my own wife?
I love John Travolta, but Gotti and the rest of the scum bag mafia are not worthy of a movie!!  I'm an Italian American and they are a disgrace to all Italians.
Add a M to the end of the title and we'll finally have an official Deez Nutz movie.
You guys hating on this movie are a bunch of cocksuckers!
he looks nothing like gotta. get some prosthetics or something
Another movie for making $$$ and old dicks in staff
Did we really need a remake of this?
Enough with the Mob movies already, that shit is so 90s. We get it, organized crime is thrilling until it inevitably comes crashing down ingloriously.
John Travolta is such a weird cunt, perfect villain
the original with armand assante was the better.
The original was better and can't be remade the way they did it
Are you serious another Gotti movie the f*** out of here stupid ass f****** Hollywood and their f****** viewers
I feel like this movie is going to be good but also show why Hollywood should stop reusing actors. Either way I'm going to still watch it..
They're going to have John Gotti trying to get other Mafia members to join the Church Of Scientology.
when it comes to italian gangster flicks i prefer diniro and pesci but im willing to give travolta a shot.
Travolta is sodomite and tarnished
Not John Travolta 😒
A homosexual portraying a gangster? lol
#FREEGATES
I GOT IT
HA GOTTI!
Meh
Quack Quack!
1996 Gotti, Armand Assante, \nCan't beat that...
terrible
lol
Wow, this looks bad
CRAP
Ha! GOTTI!
Armad asanti already made one
Looks good
MAFIA-TERRORISTS IN SUITS......
Travolta a fuge packing fag.
MOBSTER THUG SCUM!!!
Yo gotti?
Doesn't even look like gotti
Looks actually really cool
Travolta is a dick
Leah Gotti?
Scientologist faggot plays gotti??? Wtf, stupid as fuck
Uffff
Are you being faithful fiancé?
Looks good.
John Travolta is a fudge packer
John Revolting sounds nothing like John Gotti, not convincing.
Break out the Oscars.
I thought that was Arnold in the thumbnail...hehehe
Tomorrow I'm putting at least 15mn of deleted scenes on Patreon - and I will be quitting my Patreon campaign pretty soon. Last chance to jump on! http://www.Patreon.com/JoeGoes
So juggalos are nice, socially progressive low/middle class white people (and a few black people)? Did I get that right?
Thank you for this upload joe
Why you have to get all political every time?
props for still makin quality vids even though all of them are basically demonetized
This is honestly one of the best darn videos I've ever seen on youtube. These jeffalos are so sweet and Joe is good at doing his program Joe Goes.
the juggalos seem a lot more rational than trumptards.
I could see LBJ being a Juggalo
TO THE JUGGALO at 1:54 what other fanbase has been discriminated like that? Oh Manson Fans got blamed for Columbine, Judas Priest got blamed and sued for those kids shooting their faces off with a shotgun, and Slayer fans get pretty much blamed for being satanists every day soooo stop bitching
8:07 Gabe has to go home.
I only know Joe as the normy who gets amongst the Ninjas. Legendary Buttery Mother Fucker.
the white retards matter movement is what this should be called. these people are the lowest of low life scum around. this music group should just tour the slum trailer parks of america because thats where their fans live. they are classified as a gang because of  its very common for them to act out like these examples: http://www.ranker.com/list/10-most-violent-juggalo-attacks-ever/michael-gibson    how many food stamp card holders do you think are in this march?
Icp trying to latch onto the victimhood movement... Grow the fuck up
Disliked because of the censorship. Fuck that.
Fsu has it just as bad same with sosf and courage crew
I'd love to see Joe in Wolfpac.
I want to make a movement, it's going to be called suckthedick movement. Were accepting female applications only.
Can you go a video without spewing your liberal bullshit
Are you censoring your shit now because of Ads?
Damn. Joe is still making the same stuff huh. Persistence pays off I guess :)
17:36 one more to add to the outro?
The Juggalo stereotype: Dr. Pepper drinkin’, cigarette smoking, trailer park white trash fan base. I’m not a juggalo, but the fans have a strong sense of comradery and that’s chill...
I love that Joe is now an official Juggalo celebrity. The look on his face as he slowly realises that these are his people now.
Am i the only one that thinks joe goes has gotten worse
All the trailer trash in one area but these are the other side of the trailer park people that voted for Hillary lol
Welp...seems like these guys aren't as bad as I originally thought...good interview/video and eye-opening. Kind of made me realize that I probably jumped to conclusions on these guys based off the actions of a few, something a lot of people probably do. This video also did a good job of somewhat humanizing them, rather than just looking at them like 'clown people who don't give a shit about anything'.\n\nHowever...is it just me or does their little running man symbol w/ the hatchet look like it was based off a swastika? \n\nAnyways, like them or not, America is about being able to express yourself freely, and these guys sure as fuck are doing that! \n\nCool video.
i like juggalo ron weasley, but he really needs to get laid
I would like to know the occupations of these people
Joe congrats you made it to the trending page!
We're not a gang. I'm a mom. Lost it.
A lot of these people are fucking stupid they want Trump out
Oh my god this is trending!!!!
Juggalos might seem odd to us, but I think that the vast majority of them are good people
I went to high school with Mankini, and he has always been a warm-hearted, kind, and generous guy.
Next episode: Joe Goes to Censorship
Can't wait to see ginger guys comments in the comment sections lmao
best video of urs
Never clicked on a video so fast in my life
These juggalos are much more progressive than the last ones lol. It’s cool but yeah definitely different
Why are there so many communist flags?
this almost makes me wish i could handle their music, what a bunch of sweeties
Fuck me I went down to nc for the weekend wish I was there
Still waiting on your bad acid trip at Lightning in a bottle Joe
ridiculous as straight edge being considered a gang.
Ok, so how tall is he again?
I hope you disinfect that mic after that ginger got all over it.
they were the normalest people protesting that day fuck antifa and nazi bullshit grown ass men carrying tiki torches
“Auditions for the sequel to IT” lmaooo
The vid was pretty good except for the loud fat guy screaming the whole time lol. Cut him out and you got a winner ;)
This video was in part sponsored by George Soros. UNSUBSCRIBE!
The editing on this is actually perfect
So much meth in one place
That Neckbeard ginger is what ADHD is like!
Jim carry walking down the steps 09:13 lol
You won't be put on a gang list, but instead of demonitizing they'll probably start charging you for retroactive video hosting
oh shit you murdered that trash rapper
Can you be a fan of icp and not a juggalo?
Great video man, go in paint next time!
its so trashy fucking lol but i like them
It's nice to see the media on our side for once\n\nThey aren't.  They're against Trump.  Don't confuse their opposition to Trump with their support of Juggalos.
the redhead guy was super overbearing and obnoxious :(
I would pay to watch a fight between Juggalos and Antifa
If you combined the IQ's of all the Juggalos there it would be around 100
You deserve more subscribers
3 STRIKE Juggalo, black, and MALE.
Juggalos are liberals. Who'dathunkdatshit?
Wolf dash pac dot com!
Dude, there are some cute juggalettes.
that laugh at 2:48
#JoeGoGang
67 FBI Agents watched this.

The lighting on this video is a dream. You look gorgeous, pregnancy suits you. <3
Totally impressive. ^.^
Love you Fleur! It was you that I started watching YouTube because of. Hope you're feeling well xxx
Love this! Would totally recommend the new Clarins cushion foundation too! The perfect finish, buildable coverage (big deal for something with problem skin like me!) and just feels beautiful on the skin! x
thumbs up hun 🤗 x
Ooh what nail polish are you wearing??
Can’t wait for your little one to come !!
<3
❤️❤️❤️
💕💕
Hello
I enjoy your videos SO MUCH😍
Great products! I'm definitely going to try the concealer and the hair spray. Thanks a lot :)P. S. You look absolutely amazing as always.
Will you ever come to Slovenia? 😊
Perfect timing for the train journey home! That Estee BB cushion is on my list!! Xx
That brown eyeliner really makes your green eyes stand out. So gorgeous!
What about your sweater? 😊
Thanks for the reviews!  Love your nail color!  What is it?  PS, if you haven't tried Burberry Brit Rhythm fragrance, please do!  It is beautiful...im on my 3rd bottle and get compliments all the time.  😊
What nail polish are you wearing? It's beautiful! 😍
You look lovely Fleur❤️
Nice nails
That perfume bottle was cute
Some great favs! xxx
Yay! I love favourites videos <3 :)
Fleur you're so gorgeous in every video 💕
Please YouTube. Is there any way in heaven or hell that Fleur de Force does not appear on my trending list. I cannot stand her.
Having a Fleur binge tonight and the pregnancy videos are actually making me broody!! Love you so much Fleur!!😍😘
I love your channel it’s been my absolute favourite for years 😍 have you tried any of the Zoeva eye shadow pallets, I always hear so many good things about the brushes but nothing about their makeup and I would love to know!
I just saw your episode on all4 where you are cooking lasagna 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
Could you review the new Caudalie French kiss lip balms, please!!They look so interesting and adorable to me, also the shades are really pretty and natural. Thank you in advance :)\nLove from Slovenia <3
I really enjoy how Fleur talks about products, it's very honest and light :)
Amazing! love the video!!
I love the packaging on the Sam McKnight hair care, very expensive and elegent looking.
Hi Fleur!  Can you tell me which are the two scents you dont love as much from Elizabeth & James?  I've only ever tried the white one and love it, so curious about the rest..
Loved the video Fleur! Your makeup looked beautiful! What color is the By Terry lipstick? Was number 28 pecan nude the correct color? I just wanted to double check because it looked a lot darker on the website and not mauve (but it could be the online pictures). Thanks!
7 favs and I want to buy 4 of them now...Well 5 but I am not paying for the VB eyeliner as I think that range is overpriced, but everyone is saying how nice the eyeliner is.... Evo is an Australian brand so nice to see that mentioned!
I'm fairly new to your videos and am absolutely loving them! You mentioned that you usually have some go-to drugstore concealers ...and chance of a video about your fave drugstore products? ❤️💋💞
the lighting in this video is superb and it only augments your beauty, mademoiselle.
Are all the Estée Lauder eyeliners that good or just the Victoria Beckham ones???
Oooo I wanna try the new Elizabeth and James Perfume , I have two but I can't get it anywhere near me :-(
Fleur, what Shadow are you wearing here? Also, could you share your thoughts on the new Charlotte Tillbury pallet? It looks gorgeous but I'm undecided if it's worth the cost.... thanks!
Please do a video about your ear piercings!  They are so pretty!  What jewelry brands to you love?  Thanks!
love that elizabeth & james perfume! great video! xo from my channel to your’s <3
I also love elizabeth and james perfume but it winds up trending too sweet on me.  That eyeliner looks like a dream <3
Loving your nail polish, what is it?? ☺️
Love this video Fleur! Does anyone happen to know when the Estée Lauder BB Cushion will be available in Canada? Or if it's called something else here?
thyanks for thoughts on the new Elizabeth and James launches.  Nirvana Rose is still my firm favorite, but the whole line is incredible.  It was nice to hear your thoughts on the new ones.
I need to know what this lip color is!
Your nail polish ! 🙌🏼 what is it???
I'm surprised you liked the Estée Lauder Double Wear BB Cushion: I'm opposite on the skin- type spectrum to you- I am very oily. I've never liked the EL Double Wear, because it tends to look heavy. I find the same with the BB Cushion. Maybe I'm using it wrong. It's difficult to spread and feels drying even though I'm oily....although Instill get oily. I really want to like it. The shade range irritates me: in the UK, the lightest warm shade that can be purchased (or that seems to be in stock) is W2W. Which is like an NC25 at least; so I had to purchase from the US and have the shade lighter W1W, sent over....which is still a hair too dark for my NC15 skin tone.
You looks so pretty as always thanks babe
Love this. So excited for mini de force! Thank you for inspiring me to upload my first video X
Estee Lauder is always wonderful! I love their products ❤️✨
Hello Fleur, your reviews are immensely helpful for the beauty/youtube world. You are gorgeous and I've loved your channel for a while. xo
❤️❤️❤️ you're so sweet and so pretty!   I'm obsessed with creamy smooth eyeliners. It's so much easier to glide on
Need to check some of these out
You should try some of the Korean cushion foundations (Laneige, Hera, Missha). They have medium to high coverage and still gives out a very natural finish and feeling on your skin. And color range wise, they are seriously fair/pale! Thanks for the recommendations, hopefully I'll be able to find this styling spray in Switzerland! We have Batiste, it's already a good thing!\nI legit cannot wait for the little princess to come! 😍 Sending lots of love to you and your lovely family!
You are so lovely and down-to-earth 😍 Pregnancy really suits you. Love from Finland 🇫🇮
I knew the cushion foundation would make it in your favourites, I really want to try it xx
By Terry has been on my list for ages but I can never justify the purchase when there are less expensive items I like...Though, I'm sure I'd love whatever I got and never look back!
Who was here before 500views
Which of the Elizabeth & James fragrances do you not like? Besides the French Grey....I find that you and I have similar taste in fragrance.... I haven't tried the amethyst one yet.... but I LOVE Bourbon
You're so beautiful Fleur! x
Short and sweet are my ❤️
I love your makeup look it's so simple and your eyes go really well with that lip colourrrr
Keep well.  Thanks for the video.
I love your earrings Fleur! Where did you get them? Can I find them online? I would really appreciate it if you could answer me :)
Yours are the only favourites video I watch, love them! What are you wearing through your brows? They look more defined yet softer if that even makes sense ..?
I'm just excited for the new in October video:DD
Hi Fleur! What lip color are you wearing??
Hi fleur love your monthly favourites videos.would love to try the purfume.as always you look fab.xx😀
Literally cannot remember the last time I filmed a faves. You look great Fleur xxx
Your makeup always looks incredible!!! 😍👌🏻 As do your nails! You always have the prettiest colors on!!
I really really love this British accent, I want to speak like this, but I caaan't it's don't matching with my mouth 😂😩
Love that scent! Smells a lot like another favorite of mine, Aerin's Amber Musk (which I think I pick up after you recommended it in a video??)
Also obsessed with the new Perfume from E&J it is smokey perfection
I went to purchase the concealer but confused by the colours. Have you seen the other 2 lighter colours Fleur? I usually have the lightest shade in concealers, as I'm very fair but on Really Rees review the swatches came up looking really pink for 1, and really orange for 2. Your one at no 3 looks really light and more natural looking, is it at all orangey? Kate x
Evo do the best blonde toning conditioner - I find that most purple/silver shampoos are a bit drying, but the conditioner is amazing and tones more than any shampoo I've tried!
Perfect lip color 🔥
You look absolutely beautiful dahhhling!
The sultry eye look suits you so well, beautiful ❤
I love your sweater! =)
your make up is beautiful :)
I'm seriously thinking about trying that cushion if they make a shade light enough for me. Hope you are feeling well. Hugs, Summer xo
No matter where I am, I always feel at home when watching Fleur's videos 💕
I found E&J fragrances in Fenwick as well.
I absolutely love these videos! Although I'm sure I say that about all videos you make😂 love you lots Fleur xxx❤️❤️❤️
👍❤️good favourites & I loved it a lot
Hi Fleur, will you be going vlogtober or vlogmas at all this year? Just curious I love your videos 😊
EVO styling products are amazing! The salon I work at was one of the first to carry the Australian based line, and they knock it out of the park with styling and masks!
Aww Fleur you are absolutely beaming , thanks for another great monthly vid. I can't wait till your little one comes along sooooo exciting & there is a real baby boom on YouTube 😘💜✨😘
Can anyone explain to me what the point of the cushion in the foundation is? Is it just a gimmick or what. I got the L'Oréal one and it's useless.
Just now commenting. But as always STOP WHATEVER YOUR DOING AND WATCH. My most intrigued item on this video is the new Elizabeth and James scent. I definitely didn't care for it too much when I first smelt it but I guess I should give it another try since Fleur recommends it. Love you always.
What's the point in making the elizabeth and james perfumes exclusive to harrods? So you can only get it if you live in london or visit london? And the only way you can sample them to find out if you even like the scent is to visit the store. That's just bullshit. Who do they think they are? Do they think their product is so special and exclusive that only certain people deserve it? No way I'm buying their perfume now. We're talking about mary kate and ashley here, they need to get their heads out of their arses.
Whats on ur nails? Have been seeing this a lot on ur videos! Thanks!
Need daily vlog...fluer...missing everyone 😍😘😁
Hi Fleur would you consider doing  a video on your eyebrow routine?  They always good. Thanks.
The by Terri blush looks lovely, but I can get over the fact that it looks like a nipple in the compact 🤦🏼‍♀️
My YouTube unsubscribed from your channel 🙁🙁🙁 not good YouTube
Is that Elizabeth & James perfume really that good? Like is it really earth-shakingly good GOOOOOOD? Lots of people are raving about it like a bitch in heat. Lol
The last Viagra Hugh Hefner took.
Wow he looked great! 82 here!
....it's hot down here.
I believe in exactly what Hughe Hefner believes in; something good, magical, and exciting, yet unconscious.
Watch America suddenly go into a new age of purity
I can't help but wonder where you spend your eternity and did anyone tell you the sinners prayer in your old age or did they just like you for your money
Say Hi to John Holmes, let him know Ron Jeremy is taking care of unfinished business down here where he left off.  Rip playboy
The good ones always die too young.
HUGH HEFFNER HELD CIA  ,DEMON ,WORSHIPPERS AND A SATANIC PROMIS , AND SACRIFICE , OMG SACRIFICE TO THE DEVIL
So basically he got red pilled after rejection and cucked. And the rest is history
He Used women and in the end women used him....Karma.
Thanks for the good childhood memories❤️
Clint eastwood is going to be the next to go
No such things as the last words of Hefner! Ain’t a titty that will come out a bra that you can’t thank hugh.....
Hugh created a media empire that revolved around the objectification of women, and made it seem intellectual and hip to do so. We should not idolize him.
He sold his soul to the devil.   What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul.
He died with a stiffy
Can anyone from these sick twisted comments politely explain to me how is this man an example or anyone's missed one? what is his legacy he left to YOU? HOW IN ANY WAY HE HAS SHOWED ANY GOOD THING TO THIS WORLD ?
Sadly, he is not in heaven with God.
I guess the bunnies aren't going to be playing Hop on Pop anymore.
Let's see what the Word of God has to say about whoremongers like Hugh Hefner:\n\n_For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God._--Ephesians 5:5
He was so handsome
I like playgirl better than playboy
Hugh Hefner is the only person who can say 'I wasnt in it for the money' and I dont roll my eyes
I don't believe he was a nice guy
My mom was a playmate for a short time and was on that show playboy after dark this is sad I always wanted to meet this this Legend God Rest his soul
Hef was indeed on his own right a trailblazer breaking the taboos and moraes of American Society.He really set the standard and brought a relax element to Americans men and women alike there is only one Hef.
Made a fortune appealing to the natural instincts of humans. Right on man
Wait. This isn't Destiny 🤔
Went to sleep in satin and woke up in fire.
Its not about hugh or me, its about connection
Rest In Paradise Hugh Hefner... Gone But Not Forgotten. I knew this day would come but not when. To the family: I am sorry for your loss & may God be with you. 🙏amen
You can say that he got...\n\n(puts on sunglasses)\n\n*Boned.*
Hugh and so much of the media which celebrates his life disgusts me. The demoralization of humanity is owed to people like him. He should be forgotten and his mansion razed to the ground.
We lost a legend
He lived the best life
Was it a labor of love to give women quaaludes? Bill Cosby thought so too.
I wonder what his body count was...
THANK YOU  for helping me when i was 16  years old sneaking to the corner @ the Barber Shop to look/read a copy of Playboy. \nThank You for helping me looking forward in Life, and giving me a sophisticated side. \nI would Love to have a cup of coffee or/a a Drink with you.(Playboy mix drink Recipe of course) \nGod Bless you and See you In Valhalla!!
He's the real fifty shades of grey
Great human being. He lived Heaven on earth.
this guy discovered tinder in the 60s
The t.v. show the girls next door was fascinating to most of us in America who dont live that kind of lifestyle I think. I enjoyed watching the show. And yes..Hef certainly did make many articulate statements about his beliefs and stood by them. Strong man..faced alot of opposition at times. Rest in peace Hef!
He has already been living his heaven on earth.
For those of us that group up with playboy magazine from the late 60's- early 90's what a great magazine. And believe it or not the articles were great too.Pure Class.
He was not a good man so he def is not going to heaven!! Not much of a loss.
If u guys can celebrate Hugh ... Let celebrate r kelly
R.I.P Hugh Hefner you will never be forgotten I got memories of watching girls next door since I opened my eyes 😚😭😭😭😭
Standing on the Sun.\n\nWomen are multi-taskers.\nThey could literally drive many cars on a busy motorway.\nThey've got tons of common sense.\nTheir demand for recogntion on the ground started with the Suffergettes. So why have they so much common sense then?\nIt's cause their Standing on the Sun. They give life to all.\nThey made our brains and activate them/peace with their shapley appearence, sensuality and inner strengths.\nAnd it's cause their standing on the sun it's why they have a hyper intel' and peace that powers and creates men who invents entertainments........For her of course.\nOh Maria.
No one can say that man is in a better place rn
Im SURE all those women just loved him for who he was....nothing to do with money and fame.
I only read Playboy for the articles.
It goes to show you never to Judge someone without knowing their own story...  I'm not saying it's alright but what is right is not to Judge...
YOU ARE IDIOTS! THE GOV USA IS OVERTHROWN! HILLY & BILLY ARE WHO ORDERED THE DC FBI VX USED TO MURDER UN'S BROTHER! MOCKING GOD ALMIGHTY! MISSING?! ARROGANCE! WHY IS TGE SATAN LUCIFER GOV USA DC TOPOGRAPHY EVIL? HOW DID THE BIOENGINEERED VIRUSES? WE'RE THE AGENDA AGAINST RIGHTEOUS MESSENGERS? THE INVASIVE SPECIE ISSUE! THINK DEVIOUS AGAINST GOD ALMIGHTY I TERMINATE YOUR BEING REMOTELY! IDIOTS! ONLY GOD ALMIGHTY CAN MURDER HUMAN BEINGS! JESUS IS AN ALLEGORY NOT A LITERAL MAN! NO WHITE MAN CAN BE DIVINE! THINKING BLACK AMERICAN PEOPKE ARE SUPERIOR TO ALL OTHER PEOPLE OR THAT DARK SKIN BALK IS SUPERIOR TO LIFHT SKIN BLACK IS ETERNAL DAMNATION! GOD ALMIGHTY IS ASIATIC BLACK CHINESE! WHAT IS QIGONG? WHAT IS GOING ON? POP OFF!
This guy is a genius, made USA proud
This man enjoy every day of his life!!! My condolences to relatives....
He isn't a kid; he's an old goat. Satan worked through this conduit.
Jimmy Fallon should have died instead.
Mid 2000's  I obsessed with Playboy magazine but cost a lot of money,a year later I stop order playboy magazine for good.
His art ? \n\nHe's ruined countless lives with the way he treats women. Don't be fooled people.
Good riddance to bad rubbish.
R.I.P. HEF

His work touched many people. And many people touched themselves.
ulrich-rassy-passacaglia-melancholica-a
Hefner? I hardly knew her.\n#Boom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BUCpBhcYGI\nRIP
NO GRANDCHILDREN.
life well lived
The woman abuser is gone finally.
Good riddance.
He decided to gratify the most base, human, hedonistic urges to find success when he did not find meaning for his life.  His Methodist parents likely explained the need to trust God and the forgiveness of sin through faith in Jesus Christ's death on the cross and resurrection from the dead. A relationship with God in Christ and guidance of the Holy Spirit would have lead him in a meaningful life as Christ would be the the center or on the Throne of his life. Hugh needed to be the CENTER or on the THRONE of his own world and existence. (A human dilemma) Only God knows his heart and if he recalled the things his parents taught him about Jesus in the last moments of his earthly existence. May he truly be resting in peace.
R.I.B. (Rest in Breasts) Hugh...
The king of all men has passed.
Ya, won't even be noticed as missing.....irrelevant for a long time now.
Life is just vanity and chasing after wind. But to lie that he was not into it for the money is untrue. May his soul RIP.
Last words?? Probably went like this Please Jesus save me in burning up!!!!!!!!!
This guy is my God \nr.i.p Hef
Hugh's last words: Jesus, I want to ask for your......  uhhhhhhhh.  \nDon't worry, I hear it's a dry heat down there.  lol
can you imagine that all he has now is the memories from the life he had lived here on earth while he endures eternal suffering
Let's not forget that he made mainstream and acceptable the objectification of woman. This is something that as a college guy I see run awry with how college guys treat women.
He indeed built an empire out of men sexual desires but i wonder why is that an old pervert can have 7 girl friends but a modest man cant have 4 wives?! Double standard?!
He exploited young women with daddy issues
he did not achieve nothing and he will be forgotten like he never existed - how many times a day we think of Humphrey Bogart ??? hahaha   no one will miss him. He is where he is ... he did not take anything with him ... sooo much for nothing.
Sexist pig! Ugh...
The only one death you CANNOT say He's in a better place now
Lol Heff and Trump together
What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\n- The Lord Jesus Christ
I love cooking for friends and fam. But not when I’m by myself... Please do a video (or two) about recipes for one. Not too many ingredients and leftover food would be great too! #happysingle :)
Man, I was right there with you guys until you went to #PruneTown. 😂😂😂
Who the hell thinks destoning apricots is difficult? 😅
OK, random challenge idea. The normal people cook and the chefs judge, but the chef's do not know what the secret ingredient/inspiration is.  This way the normies have to come up with (probably with viewer help) an inspired recipe that they make and the chefs have to figure out what the inspiration was based off the dishes. A  challenge all around.
I seriously think that Ben's idea of quick and easy means you don't have to grind your own wheat for the flour.
I love the look on Jamie's face when he gets to do the This is our........sorted!. That's the joy of cooking right there.
Jaimie did the thing Jaimie did the thing!!
This looks really good! I'm going to make it next week, and might add some barley in there somewhere. :)
WHERE IS hello, and welcome to fridgecam...?!
I knew it. I knew no matter what, Ben wouldn't have given a 10/10. That look on his face though, was priceless.
6:13 Is it really a technical word or did ben just make that up 😂😂😂😂
Ben is like the professor I had last semester. You do everything perfectly to the standard they requested, and yet ... A-
**englishly and sadly** you could miss out on double cream altogether
A lot of fucking effort for an effortless meal.
I'm so proud
Jamie - did you find out why you lost 0.5 marks?
Made this tonight with some alterations and it was a huge hit with the boyfriend. Subbed green beans for the spinach (not a fan) and normal white beans for the butterbeans. Took the 'pear' suggestion from Ben to sub the apricots as well, that was great :)
Dear sorted food gents, what is the best recipes for a person who is sick?
HAHAHAHA Did anyone else rewind the beginning with Ben waving behind Jamie because I did a lot.. totally worth it!
I wish Ben wouldn't appear in every video. He's getting annoying.
Please do more like this and do slow cooker stuff too!
You're cheffin' all over the place! *literary 15 seconds later*  you can see how it all just 'mleau' (pronunciation?? XD) back, technical word for wilted xD yeah Ben, you do you xD
Hey guys x love the recipe but do pork medallions cost a lot? I recently started university, could you do some cheap, quick and easy meals for students? One problem I find when cooking is the portion size x I always make too much for one meal! Could you guys help? Love the vids =) Thank you!
I think I'm likely not alone in this: but I love you guys. For real!! Glad to be part of the Kickstarter campaign xo
You don’t need to eat meat it’s ruining the environment and our bodies
Always looking for midweek meals. Midweek is when I work late so these are always appreciated
More of this! Loving it :)
Leviticus 11:7 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.\n\n8 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you.\n\n9 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.\n\n10 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you:\n\n11 They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.\n\n12 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you.
I just got an idea. What if you make a battle in which James and Ben ‘supervise’ the boys where they cook a somewhat complicated meal? You can make pairings like James & Barry and Ben & Jamie or whatever. That’ll be fun to watch!
Lol I've been vegetarian my whole life but surely pig and fruit don't go well together? 😂😂😂
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
look like to much work. Delivery much easier 😃
Hahhaha is the last line + Sorted the chef's right? :P good work boys
Jamie is cute. 😀 he's my fave
4:36 Thank you, Ben. I now know the easiest way to get stoned.
Do more of these!
still can't get behind the whole 'meat+fruit' thing.
I'm allergic to a lot of fruits, many which are stone fruits. What other alternatives could I use? (Apples and pears are not an options either!)
He didn't salt/pepper both sides I think D:
You guys should make poulet-frites. Basically rotisserie chicken with a bed of potato/fries underneath to catch the fat drippings and other deliciousness from the chicken
Don't worry Ben, I can give you the other half an inch.\n\n*sorry, it was sitting out there*
what would be a good substitute for prunes?
Can not believe the amount of 'je ne sais quoi' you shoved in there...
guys if you want to eat healthy and save money delete Food app from your phone
Could we do a student meal week please? like quick and easy meals for one that are also healthy-ish and cheap? :)
Do a segment of different kinds if food from ancient times please!!!
This is great, definitely going to try this out. Would love to see more!
This was great. Can we have more like this? I don't like sweets very much and I feel like there's been sooooo many desserts on this channel lately haha.
Are prunes needed to Chef all over the place?
They are so attractive!!! Single?
How is Jamie still so useless 😂
Make a series called mid-week meals! Seriously need more of such recipes for my own mid-week meals
I still watch most of the videos on this channel, even though I am a very picky eater and find a good 85% of the recipes disgusting. The boys are so entertaining, and even if I don't like a recipe (eg, fruit paired with meat.. NOPE!), I still get ideas from recipes and incorporate them into my own cooking. <3 you guys!
Ben was on fire today!
Amazing, thanks! But can get a super fight with a lot of beautiful men, please. Like have Tom Daley again and his hubby Lance Black and form two teams, like for Halloween!!!!? Because that will be Epic!!!! Please!!!!
need more of these types of vids :D\nnice and easy meals but still gorgeous
I love recipes like this! Is it possible to see some more autumnal recipes that can be slow-cooked? I work most of the day, so I'd love to come home and have something ready and waiting for me!
The missing half a point for full marks was obviously a sprig of mint
Dämn that music, anyone know what the tracks are on this one? <3
Watching these kind of videos remind me what a good teacher Ben is. If I was in his place I'd get frustrated and do everything myself haha
Any reason you haven't used the reverse sear method for steak/pork chop recipes?
Why are there bits of dead animal in your dish 😕?
Haha The zooming in on the food reminds me of Gordon Ramsey!!\n\n\n\n\nWHERE'S THE LAMB SAAAAAAUAUUAUUAUACE
So easy thumb in the middle Stoned.. Yeahhhhhhhhhhh
This reminded me I've got lamb cutlets in the freezer, excellent.\nWell done Jamie.
3:55 Jamie had the tongs in his left hand but he still used his other hand to put the pork into the pan...\n\n\nI love it XD!
Is anyone going to tell Ben that apples don’t have stones?
You guys should do more mid week meals, love this!
Love the one pan recipes! I'm gonna try this one next week
He looked so happy to be able to say the 'sorted' line, awww! <3 lmao
dried apricots have a different flavor to fresh ones though . . .
Jamie lost some weight, looking good bro 😎👌
More of these, please!! 😘
This is so encouraging to see and holy heck it looks delicious!
James looks so proud at the end 😂😂
More videos like this!! Please:D This looks sooooo good and easy <3
Thanks for the recipe, very interesting you guys!
I'm a vegetarian why am I watching this?
Jamie should have put a sprig of mint on it to get a 10/10
TREAT YO SELF!
That's pork loin not fillet!
Whoa, that looks and sounds amazing!
Amazing!!!
he said simplicity...
That looks AMAZING!
wher frome you hawe guys that big pork filet or that was pork loin
Porking? Was that a Freudian slip, Ben? Lol!
Stoned! 😍
Reminds me of medieval cuisine!
Bens vocabulary: Amazing, hot, gentle, succulent, British
More one pot recipes
Do you guys do any vegetarian meals?
Could I substitute the pork with those big mushrooms and chicken stock with veggie stock to make it vegan?
Why is it chicken stock is always paired with pork when we normally use matching meat/stocks (ie chicken with chicken stock, beef with beef stock). Is pork stock just not a thing?
I just bought a slow cooker - can you do a week of slow cooker meals please guys? Thanks so much!! :D
Running out of inspiration ...??? I don't understand what you're saying. You make thousands of meals in your lifetime. Why would it being the middle of the week make any kind of difference to anything??? I don't understand. ???
Hey sorted food names Noah and I am a second year uni student at UWE and my cooking skills are pretty bad.Do you have any student recipies they are easy enough but time effective that anyone could cook them as a tea.Great video wish I could cook this
Never thought of apricot with pork but it sounds delicious. Too bad it's 11:30pm where I'm at, watching, or I'd cook this right away. I'm not sure my family would appreciate my midnight cooking 😂
Unfortunately I can't eat pork (religious reasons). Is there a protein I can substitute in for this meal? I really like the flavors used in here. Beans and fruits etc.
How do you get the smell of garlic out of ur hands
this lady smoking that's Uma Thurman 😂😂😂
Can you try the clothes on in your next one so we can see how you style them 😭😍😘
Thank you Sarah, i now need to go to Primark asap!😍🤣❤️
Men are just pain in the arses, so at least wearing their clothes they're good for something that was brilliant 😂😂
Don't do this to me Sarah
Why does this girl get so much hate she seems nice enough?
What I wanna know is have you not watched pulp fiction?! Xxxxx
Love this, sooo much nice stuff! i need to get to primark asap. The comment about mens clothes made me lol xxxx
Lol I've never spent anywhere near £200 in primark😂Wish I had money
that glow!!
BRB just going to Primark 👀
Babe you should try on the items so we can see what they look like on you!!! :D <3
LOVED this vid as I can never find the good stuff in primark (it's like searching for diamonds in A LOT of rough) - gonna head to Primange v soon now!! Can you pleasee do a Zara haul? Think you'd find lots of great stuff, not just casuals but also for going out/clubbing (throw back to the Zara white lace bralette you wore a few years ago or something) xxx
So true about the thongs 😂 think I own every colour! Loved this xx
Ugh I’m trying to save money and you’re out here making videos like this 😩😂
Love all of these. You literally want me to go off sick tomorrow and sneakily run to Primark 💁🏻😂
Would love a try on haul x
That highlight though 🔥
Loveeee your hauls, if you could do ones from like online shops like PLT mssguided etc, that'd be fab, your style is always on point!!
Mushroom pink? 😂😂😂
Pointless to do a haul if you're not trying things on 😰
Love your channel ❤️ it was kinda difficult to see items like the jumpers that you were holding
Whenever I go to primark I never find anything 🤦🏽‍♀️😭
Would you do a video on what you do to stay so slim? I know you've had a bit of a shape up journey and I'm struggling with it a bit at the mo! 💘
Great haul, i really need to go to primark 😱🙌🏼💕✨
fan girled a little over Pink Floyd haha x
Hi Sarah where is your ring light from? Xxx
I never ever go in primark, cos the last time I went in was literally like 7 years and it was terrible but now I think it seems to have got so much better!
£200 is like what most people spend anyway

Beautiful girl and nice Video. Where do you get this amazing Lashes

I wish Primark would do an online site and ship everywhere!
I’m sorry but I really hope you truly like Pink Floyd, otherwise why would you wear that top. Pisses me off when people wear bands Tshirts and don’t even know who the fuck the band are...
Would of made sense to actually try the stuff on. Also what on earth is up with the eyebrows?
Why don't you get a real job instead of posting shit on YT.
court heels!!! comfortable????? I cant last 10 mins!!
😂😂 if you don't have this underwear are you ok 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Men are just pains in the arse's 😂😂

Piss of if girls didn't have men the human race would die out because girls wouldn't be able to reproduce you daft prick
The smoking lady is Uma Therman 😂 you need too see pulp fiction ASAP
The crushed velvet bra would look fantastic with a pair or structured leather look leggings and a blazer
She reminds me of me so much! I absolutely love baggy jumpers and buying from the men's section! I also have that pulp fiction tee and I bought it in a large too 🤣 the yellow baggy jumper is a must!!! I'll be getting that when I go in Primark next week lol
What is your accent?
Definitely should of got involved in the beauty section! Gutted you didn't show any finds there. The brushes and make up is as up there as the clothes
What primark did you go too? Xx I've been after that bag for weeks💛😩
Why the fuck would anyone spend £200 in primark?
Omg haven’t you ever watched pulp fiction!?! Amazing film - must watch 💕
Amazing babe ❤ would love to see more haul style videos from you!!
You're actually amazing - totally agree about mens clothing might as well use them for one thing 😏 xo
Yes, I was trolling British cider lovers. Sorry.
Ohhhhhhhh so good!\nI will.....WILL try this one!\nGreets from far away Germany....which is gettin colder day by day :)
'If you throw that away.... We can't be friends That is why we love you Chef!
Wow.
What did you say the glaze at the bottom of the pan is called ?
Hi ☺️, could you do a video making mulligatawny soup sometime? Thanks!
The cadence of your voice over in this video is kind of making it hard to watch.  Sounds like your asking a question perpetually
Hello Chef John. I just made this and the pork was delicious, but the gravy is too tangy/vinger-y. Did I not reduce it enough? I reduced the liquid low and even added about 2 teaspoons of sugar because the sauce was very vinegar-y.
rub rub 💩👅💋🐛
My mouth watered ugh 😑 I want some !
his voice goes up and down again and again
SPIDERMAN IS HUNGRY ! SPIDER MAN HA HA HA HA HA
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Yummiest
Why does he sound like he is singing?
This is my new place to come to when I miss my dad reading me bed time poems.
OM NOM NOM NOM NOM
Looks ultra-yum! I also admire that freakishly small ladle.
Wow
Interesting take on Somerset Pork.
i reduce my sauce/gravy in a vacuum evaporator.. so much better
Looks like you stole this idea from another YouTube Channel
Chef, at about 6:11 you showed a close up of the simmering gravy. The sides of the dutch oven had fond on them. Why didn't you scrape it down and dissolve it into the simmering liquid?
First time the cayenne came in so late
listen to me now and hear me later....lol
Lol give it the old poke-a-poke-a I love Chef John!!! ^.^ Hope everyone is having great day!!
Omg, that sounds foodgasmic!
Looks amazing!!!!
El chema de nega
you is you 💛
Delicata squash? Yes,please!
Kosher salt on pork...
Buttered rice you say?
That looks soooo good.
YOU ARE TRENDING :)
#25 trending thats what i wanna see
always love ur recipe this 1 looks outrageously YUM! Thank chef John.
Yoooo, Chef John is trending
Making this!! 😋😋
omg
John,  I shouldn't watch your videos at 1 in the morning.  I'm now gonna go cook.
Would this work with beef for those who can't eat pork?
Stole my recipe except that I always leave it bone on.  You just can't replicate the feel and taste of collagen.  Way better than resorting to flour or corn starch to thicken the sauce.  I also add thick apple slices to the braise so when done you have a more less savory apple sauce
John have you tried traditional English cider? Flat, strong, dry, tasting 100% of apples, tart, etc? I really think youd like it (maybe in recipes like this, or to drink...)
Takes sooo long to cook. I cooked it in a pressure cooker and took half an hour only.
we're not trying to make pulled pork here\nBut could we make pulled pork with a similar method?\npossibly thickening the sauce so it sticks more to the meat?
My heart never beats like it beats at this
I would love to see the squash recipe as well.
Ok, going on next grocery list.  Can't wait to drink the sauce!\n\nJust had the billionaire frank and beans, never been a fan but Chef John's recipe is simple, quick and absolutely gonna be an added favorite to my house (I cheated in one spot and didn't use water, I used veg broth ; ) watch the vidy and you'll understand.
Omg.....this is a alllllllllll day to cook 🍖 meat. Thanksgiving turkey 🦃 doesn't even take this long.! I'm going to give it a try though.
in Turkish pork shoulder means domuz omzu shoulder is omuz pork is domuz THAT'S NO COINCIDENCE
I have that exact same pot but can't brown anything in it! How do you brown meat on ceramic?
The rhythm of how you speak is very entertaining! :)
Wow not hours before I watched this video I bought a delicatta squash! Please show me what to do with it :)
Hi Chef John, is this recipe going up on All Recipes?
Sounds yummy. I’m making it this weekend.  Please do the squash video, too. It is squash season, after all.
You are the boss of your pork shoulder stewed in a creamy apple cider sauce!  Yes!  Want to learn more about Delicata squash for sure.  At first I thought it could have been sautéed apples which, of course, would have paired nicely with the pork shoulder.   Regardless Chef more on Delicata and other winter squash types.  Very underrated vegetable.
This man is bordering on national treasure
I could of used this recipe about 4 days ago when I found a 5LB pork shoulder for $7.00 . The only recipes I could find was bbq pulled pork.
My food wish is a open cheese pie\nhttps://i.pinimg.com/originals/55/d5/ea/55d5eac2d9f69dd00e390535d6958ff5.jpg
Congrats on being #20 on the trending list! Good for you.
the cadence of this dude's voice bothers me
Did recipe with beef shoulder instead...worked great!
Pork shoulder is one of my favorite cuts from pork besides pork ribs and belly. Usually pork loins are too lean to my taste unless I make it sous vide.
Everything is better with a touch of Cayenne.
I love pork in cider! Lol
Cider from France??? Live local,buy local,love local,,,support our own.

I would like to try this with lamb.
Wooo 25 on trending!! 😁😁😁
I think I will add a star anise and a cinnamon stick.
what does hard cider mean? how is it different from regular cider? (a non-native english speaker here)
the link doesn't pull up anything. wanted to send my husband the recipe but it just opens a blank browser
Is a Dutch Oven just a ceramic coated Cast Iron Pot?
really nice recipe.  and delicata squash is the absolute best.
I think the folks who claim their pork shoulders always end up dry are using tenderloin.
0:38 B O N E L E S S
Hey Chef John made a pork stew that was really good. I'll pm you the recipe if you want.
wonderif i can do with country style ribs. need a new recipe for them
Could you apply this to a pork tip sirloin or is that too lean for this method/recipe?
I'd put it in the oven on number one and leave it for about 4 hrs, then finish and thicken on the hob ;)\nGuess I'm the Roy Scheider of my braised pork and cider :)
Will definitely try this braised pork. It's theraputic watching and listening to Chef John.
Hi Chef John, I wanted pass on a tip foe skimming grease. I use a gravy ladle, like the one you were using in the video.I have a cup close by to put it in in case I need to do any more simming. Thank you for sharing all the know how and recipis.
Chef John, Amid the chaos, corruption and scandal that peppers the news on a daily basis, your humour and good nature provide the perfect antidote! Please keep up the great work!
FRESH-LY
Just made it. With a twist I reduced with a bit of the best home made beef stock, no salt added, and put just a few flakes of teragon. Wow amazing.
bouncin on my boy's d to this
All I saw in the title was PORK CREAMY SAUCE
I've been watching Food Wishes for years! Do you know how much I support and love the channel? I don't even skip the ads so you can get that revenue. Stay hustling Johnny boy.
His voice makes me sooooo sleepy \n😴😴\nI'm not complaining or anything
Making a batch of hard cider next week.  Looking forward to trying this recipe after it ferments.
Chef John when I eat ass should I add a bit of cayenne or not? What do you think
No garlic Chef John?
where is the beef, I mean MEAT!!!!!! I'm not much on boiled fat.
i dont know enough about being jewish, but is there a thing with kosher salt on pork, is that halal or whatever ok forget it.
Now give it the old poka poka  i will forever use this😂😂😂
I am sure others commented on @  4:14  the sauce went from a liquid to a thicker more reduced sauce. Plus pan had more meat in after the edit.  Chef John I am rather disappointed in this presentation.
chef john - i really must ask you this: do you have some religious objection to pressure cookers??  while this may not be the best example, but there are plenty where you could have used one and (imho) think you could have gotten better results, far faster.  you NEVER use pressure cookers.  what's up with that?\n\nanyone else with me on this?
Good god his tone of voice is so crazy its like hes excited about every single sentence that comes out of his mouth oh my god!
the brown stuff at the bottom of the pan is actually called the suuc. the fond is when you deglaze it with liquid.
OK BUT CAN WE TALK ABOUT NAMJOON'S HAIR BECAUSE HOLYYY-
someone find taehyugs bag already hoLY how can someone be this rude¿?¿ and yoongi why are you like this gOD i love him
The best of bts💥

I don't know why I change moods so easily at the beginning of this video because at 0:06 I start to fangirl because of the dance moves, and then I start laughing so hard when they start with the freestyle at 0:11
J Hope is such a bias wrecker 💖💖

great collab 😍
Once you go PC...;-)
Such a great video Sara, love it! Get the Lofree keyboard, it’s mechanical, wireless, backlit and super retro looking! For mouse look at the Logitech MX master 2S, it’s got tonnes of customisable buttons and feels amazing to use. For a monitor, check out the Acer H277HU, it’s a 2K monitor that looks super stylish! All are available in white which would make a really clean setup with minimal cables as both the mouse and keyboard are wireless! Hope this helps, can’t wait to see the final setup!!
I just picked up the 1080 founders edition. Does anyone know the difference between it and the one Sara & Austin are using in this build?
Hey peachy check this out for video editing monitoring goodness https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1224156-REG/lg_34uc88_b_34_21_9_curved.html
Logitech MX Master mouse, with a logitech g810 orion would be a very good keyboard mouse combo
For mouse, I'd get the best one in the world: the MX Master 2S. And for keyboard (get a mechanical!), you can either go with a Corsair or Logitech brand.
This is super Fresh!!!!
Get an ultra wide monitor. I just got one for my editing....life changing. It works so much better than dual screen.
Congrats on the build!! You'll definitely enjoy having a computer faster than you while editing. As for the mouse recommendation, definite check the Logitech MX Master
I'd go with the Dell 4K ultra wide curve.
I want a GTX 1080 TI\nBUT TWO OF THEM IN SLI\nI MADE IT RHYME \nSO LET ME HAVE A LIKE\n\n\n\n\nAND is he your boyfriend
Yaaasssss. Seems like a pretty cool dude. Glad he was able to hook you up wit dat knowledge yo!
These two should more together!
Too bad he used old equipment and a Ryzen processor for that build.
For a keyboard, get a Razer Blackwidow Chroma, and a logitech mx master 2 for the mouse
If you'd gone Intel instead of AMD you could have ended up with a Hackintosh and had your choice of OS's.   \n\nAs far as a monitor,  and respectable brand, 4k, with 100% sRGB colorspace, and as high a bit-depth as your budget allows.\n\nA mouse is a very personal thing so go to a store where you can test them.  Keyboard is nearly the same but I generally like Logitech wired and wireless keyboards.
You have to check out the logitech craft keyboard, the knob works super well with Adobe stuff and it can also connect to your macbook and a third device. The logitech mx  master 2s is a really cool, really functional mouse that again is amazing for creators with multiple machines.
I would suggest getting a Logitech MX Master 2s Mouse, Das Mechanical Keyboard they work both on Mac and Win and BenQ Pro 32inch 4K monitor or LG's 31.5inch 4K Monitor.
all pc fan boys were just staring at the beroll in awe
WHY WAS THIS in my notifications
as a video editor you would love wide-screen monitors! either 29 or 34 inch
Austin - it was definitely 8 ^_^
Recently got the Mx master 2 And it is Really Nice. (As a full time video editor) the vertical scrolling is such a Nice feature And its not (too) expensive.
With a kick ass monitor, keyboard and mouse. This will be awesome. \n\nI want to see the review of this machine already.
-“What’s a ‘cd drive’, you’re gonna have to explain that to me”\n-“Replaced the FLOPPY DISK.”\nLOL great explanation 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I hope you show us the new setup when it's ready. I'd like to see the process of you deciding why you picked what u picked. I'd also love to see you use ur pc on video. I like seeing people switch over from Mac to windows. It's an interesting perspective, especially since ur a tech fanz
best Mouse for editing is for sure the Logitec MX Master!
Definitely a 34 inch ultrawide of some sort. The LG ones are pretty good.
Logitech MX Master is the mouse for you, that's all I know :)
MX Master mouse, Logitech k810 keyboard. The keyboard is very similar to the apple bluetooth keyboard , but backlit. it's awesome! Acer Predator Z35P 35 ultra wide  monitor.
Why not keep using your old monitors?
Get the logitech G403 mouse, i hear only good stuff!
Wow! I got the same exact tower! My husband is building me one also because my macbook pro is old and cant even handle premiere. It looks like we have the same specs! Love this!
For a mouse I would recommend a logitech mx master and for monitors look at the 4k ultrawides from LG
You should get a Mechanical keyboard as it lasts longer than a regular membrane keyboard and it feels nicer. Depending on your situation and sound loudness preferences you should probably research into different switches xD... as for a mouse, as you don't really do any gaming stuff i dont think at least, you could go for an ergonomic mouse that feels nice in your hands as you edit.
I swear you guys are the same person
I really love how Sara is collabing with pretty big you tubers and she makes content that is just as good as them and she is a smaller youtuber.
Get the Logitech MX Master. You will love it.
Ahhhh love this collab!!!! I love when Sara gets more and more successful!!!
https://youtu.be/JDJDeuJbiKc
Mouse : Logitech MX Master\nKeyboard : Cherry MX Board 6.0\nMonitor : Benq BL3200PT
This was an awesome collab!!!
First you need ultrawide monitor need !! And Logitech mx master \nAnd mechincal keyboard from corsair
good video
Razer mamba( mouse) and a razer blackwidow v2 or x for keyboard. There are also cool corsair keyboards as well. I dont know model names but  samsung monitors are good.
Jesus, woman you are 23 not 13.Don't pretend you don't know what a apple drive is.
An lg 34 inch ultra wide and a Logitech mix master 2 mouse
Building with the peach is definitely NOTthe pits.   Looks like you made a great machine.  Have fun learning Windows and avoiding viruses.
Hey guys this is Austin.
Austin explaining this to sara is me explaining my pc's to everyone else
is the  GeForce GTX 1080  really worth the price compared to a 1060  6 gig? almost twice the price and not sure it will boost premiere's performance.
I don't understand why you'd get a wireless card for $70 when an ethernet works fine. If you're gonna spend a shit tonne on a PC you might as well get a 1080 ti. There's no point in getting a more expensive case. If the computer's for video editing, I'm pretty sure external drives would be better than the 4tb hdd.
where'd the second noctua fan go!? O.O #SaraHasToManyFans ?!
Welcome to the PC master race. Monitors, depending on the budget, are tough. I'd say, for editing, the most important options are resolution and color recreation. Gaming monitors have amazing refresh rates and low input lag but tend to come with TN panels instead of IPS, which is no good for editing. I'd stay away unless they have an IPS panel. For a mouse, it depends lol. A wireless one that I would recommend for you would be the Logitech MX Master 2S. Otherwise, look at the features you want, and don't be afraid of a mouse because its labeled as a gaming mouse. Gotta get a mechanical keyboard too. Expensive, seriously, but so worth it in terms of durability alone. Then you need to look at the type of key switch. The most popular, and kind of default, type are Cherry MX switches. If you want a tactile feel and click on each keystroke, I recommend Cherry MX Blue switches. If you want that feel with a quieter click, I recommend the Cherry Mx Brown switches. If you want a smooth keystroke, the Cherry MX red are the ones. Logitech and Razer make their own key switches, but do tell you what type of Cherry MX switches they are comparable to.
Most random collab lol but good stuff couldn’t have clicked any faster
What monitor stand is that?? I really want one!
Oh this is one of those crispy videos.
The second hard drive didnt pick up on post because it hasnt been formatted yet and cant pickup the volume letter.
don't forget to turn off your privacy setting on windows 10 😂😂😂
Anyone else pained by the plastic film on the glass not being peeled off? :-(
Definitely get a Logitech MX Master for editing
Monitor wise BENQ for professional work is the best: http://www.benq.us/product/monitor/creative_class/\n^Any of those are great options and they come factory Adobe RGB 99% on almost all of them I think!\n\nMy gf is a fan of yours and I recently built her a Video Editing/Photo Editing rig in actually the same case and she got this one and loves it:http://www.benq.us/product/monitor/pv3200pt
They design everything around air flow? How fucking delusional are you?
You should definitly look for an ultrawide 4K monitor since you're going to be doing a lot of editing. Awesome video!
45c ? Damn that's hot with that cooler!
Hey Sara... GREAT vid and collab! I recently got the Logitech K780 keyboard and Logitech Wireless Mobile MX Anywhere 2S mouse (mostly cause it fits nicely in my hand). The keyboard is has a really nice cool design, it's very quite and has a place for your phone lol. The Logitech Flow software is pretty cool because with these two devices, you can switch between 3 different devices (Apple and PC) really easily. Sometimes it's  a bit flaky but it still works really well for me.
Cannot recommend this mouse more: http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/mx-master-2s-flow?WT.mc_id=AMR_DR_Q4_FY14_SERP&WT.srch=&cvosrc=ppc.google.logitech%20mx%20master%202s&cvo_campaign=&Matchtype=e&cvo_crid=199081948742&partner=DR&category=brand&cvokID=&gclid=CjwKCAjw3rfOBRBJEiwAam-GsEqauBWojF7NNFjWKXVlAFaWERZEYx4Go0Ig7SJ0wqYMn8cCU-Z5OhoCIMwQAvD_BwE
woo! I've been waiting for this
With the gtx 1080 i would go with an ultra wide monitor which is awesome for video editing. 3440X1440 Resolution will give you an nice wide view for your premier timeline (I use the LG 34UM88C-P). For a mouse i run the Logitech g502 which is very comfy and has adjustable weights so you can really tweak it to your liking. keyboard really comes down to personal preference. I love mechanical keyboards with mx cherry Blue switches, but some people find them to be far to0 loud. I run the cougar 700k keyboard which has an awesome macro system which can really help with editing.
I have a dell monitor, they make some nice ones I would say. Mouse a logitech, dont have to be a big one with many buttons, mine is just a simple one with left/righ buttons and scrool wheel button in the middle, just buy one with a cord, they work better than the wireless ones and are more precise.
Go for a razer keyboard.  Better to have tournament edition. And razer mamba mouse. And lg 4K monitor too
Great video ... Thanks to you and Austin ...  PC Yes ... All you need now is a solid O.S.  Like ... Ubuntu !!!    :-)
Mouse: Logitech MX Master, you'll love it, and it works great with your mac too. Keyboard: some would say get a Mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Brown switches, but just get something that you like, for example Microsoft makes some awesome keyboards. Monitor: I go with any Ultrawide monitor, one should be enough, but if can get 2 normal ones as well to put on the sides ;). Hope this helps. (I am also a Mac user mainly, and a PC user sometimes)

Now can you do a premier shortcuts guide for PC users? :D
In terms of a monitor I would recommend a 3440x1440p 34 ultrawide monitor with an ips display. LG makes a some that are really good 34UM88C-P for a little over $600 is kind of expensive, but for your use case it is worth it imo. Logitech MX master is a really popular mouse for editing/general productivity. Just in terms of monitor the most important thing is that you get an IPS display as IPS panels have the best color accuracy which is a necessity for video editing and more specifically color grading.
salesman and customer conversation
boooooooo...... Amazing Video though
Go for 1440p monitors
Try looking at SteelSeries and Logitec mice and keyboards
I recommend the ASUS PB287Q 28 4K Monitor:http://a.co/gNVJiO9
YAAASSSS!!! Two of my most favorite yuotubers.
I would get Eizo ColorEdge CG318-4K
Mouse - Logitech Mx Master 2s white
Mouse - Roccat Kova or Corsair M65 Pro white.

Fantastic! Awesome Collab! Congrats Sara! Nice to mee you Austin!
C’mon just look how bulky that PC looks!!! For someone who loves esthetic it’s just not nice looking! And i love the simplicity of Mac, and not having to update Service Packs and the Problems with Windows, you name it. Plus who uses a PC to play Games on it. And just for the Editing stuff with Adobe or Apple products the MacBook Pro, was way better! And on top at the end of the year there’s an iMac Pro coming! C’mon Sara
So, here she has two living legends from film and television; so what does Megyn Kelly focus on? AGE! Throughout the whole segment, rather than focusing on their film project, she keeps asking them both about age and plastic surgery. Sorry Megyn, but interviewing is not your forte either. What an awkward interview.
Kelly is not a people person and has zero charisma. This interview is so awkward.
Poor little Megyn. She can't hold a conversation. Why in the world does anyone think she can handle this sort of interview? So embarrassing.
It's inevitable, she's going to be kicked off. NBC, just save the time & money and do it now. She's nothing special and was only popular because Trump talked about her vaginal blood.
Megyn Kelly is the worst. How is it possible to be so thoughtless? Jane Fonda and Robert Redford are amazing and I wish she could have asked relevant questions. #losthope
Omg that question to Jane Fonda was so inappropriate and ill timed! Horrible horrible horrible! Megan is so bad at this job it's startling.
cringe interview
Megyn Kelly is AWEFUL.
Horrible interview.
megyn is just so awkward.
The interviewer couldn't make it more awkward for these legends with her imbecilic questions
Is MK interested in anything  besides appearances and age????? How shallow! (and that's a kindness!)\nwhatever made someone hire her in this capacity ??? nearly brainless. And the audience as well, WHY would they populate the seats for a program like this?
Really!??? That's what you're asking? Such a waste of time... can i ask you something Megan? Can you leave!? right now!
Megyn Kelly is horrible! I would never watch her show after seeing this!
Megan: Lose the f**king pen! IT's stupid
Redford is funny! MK screws up with Jane and is inappropriate in her questions.
Megyn should quit this job....its just not for her....shes off topic
Megyn Kelly sucks on morning tv.  Who asks about plastic surgery during an interview about a movie.  Her “gotcha” style interviews sucks and hurts the TODAY show brand. Stars are going to start boycotting appearances because of her
I can't believe MK had two of the greatest actors sitting right in front of her and decides to discuss plastic surgery! REALLY??? She's blowing her chances, you can't teach humility. Crash and burn...........
Megyn says it's a beautiful, beautiful film @ 5:00 and it sounds so disingenuous, she probably didn't even see it!!
Megyn Kelly  is a parasitic tick
I thought she said Arseholes at Night ! ( it's the American accent, I'm a Brit)  Terrible interviewer and possibly the most insulting dumbest cringeworthy ageist questions she could ask ... these two legends. And yet they were still gracious . Wish someone would give them the time they deserve and a respectful interviewer
Three Days Of The Condor is the best suspense film ever made.  And one of the best films ever made, period.
Yeah plastic surgery and exercise.
So ageist, so sexist. this was criiiiiiiiiiinge lol
Hanoi Jane, never forget.
Megyn is forced and beating to her own drum at the expense of Fonda here. And also, why didn´t you ask Redford about his facelifts? Probably had as many as Jane has. Be a little self-critical about how you reproduce old stereotypes of women by the questions you ask. Not cool, sorry.
hahHHA I AGED NORMALLY BUT ALSO HIT THEM INJECTIONS HAHA XD IM GOOD ACTOR
Miss Kelly should just get off TV!!!!!
Megyn Kelly is no OPRAH. WHY is she so obsessed with Jane’s looks and body -_- she’s so fake. Trying to force feed us superficiality. She is spearheading ageism by constantly talking about Jane’s looks.
First the Will and Grace Snafu. Now this.\nYikes.
Cringing in embarrassment for Megyn. Why not askJane who she's looking forward to working with on the next project? Jane has class for miles!
MK just can't stay in the moments.... interrogate off topic vs. appreciate now
She got this job solely because people felt bad that Trump made fun of her. He makes fun of everyone, that doesn't mean she's not a jerk. She does not belong on The Today Show.
it's amazing how when you only see a short clip about the plastic surgeon question, an impression is left with the viewer how inappropriate the situation was and how angry Jane Fonda was. However, when you watch the entire interview, it was really only a blink in the context of it all.
Jane was looking daggers at Megyn and rightly so.  Megyn was extremely rude, would she want to be asked about her hair extensions?   I've always liked Jane Fonda and am glad to see her and Redford together again in a sequel of sorts to Barefoot in the Park.  I don't recognize that electric horseman movie because it was so awful.
man, do they live in the past or what?
Redford has become so effeminate.   He has been a good actor and last saw him in A WALK IN THE WOODS  with Nick Nolte in 2015.
Megyn Kelley like most conservatives and Fox News anchors are tone deaf and just completely ignorant.
MK is not for daytime TV - she does not relate - she is a hard news person
I  would spit on Hanoi Jane heifer dog
Her show appeals to idiots. That's all
I just heard the next episode is going to be completely devoted to DIY tips to protect your family from the New Black Panther Party. You're doing gods' work Megyn!
She destroyed her career when she left fox...today show screwed themselves after paying millions for her😂😂 instant buyers remorse
women have nothing to offer other than their looks. they are all terrified of aging, its sweet justice for us men who have to watch them entitled and evil all their life
never has there been two ego maniacs like Megyn Kelly and Jane Hanoi Jane Fonda pompous arrogant complete drones .  Redford that ship has come and sailed but still hanging on for some publicity and to be adored by the public.  PATHETIC !!!!!
Megyn Kelly already reached her peak of fame. It's all downhill from here.
i came here for Robert & Jane\n& then i saw  the cow\non the presidential debate \nit is her ?
She is trying its hard to overcome old habits fox news was and is the worst
Almost every question had to do with age.  WTF!?  When the interviewees keep having to save the interview, you know that something's JUST NOT RIGHT.   Redford's right about Jane, she's amazing.
Jane and Robert came to promote their new movie and Megyn consistently tried to take the conversation to any other topic besides the movie.  Strange way to do a movie-promo interview.  I can see why Jane was annoyed.  And Megyn still didn't take a hint.  She's got a big learning curve on how to do this kind of show.
Can't stand Megan Kelly, what a horrible interview
Awful host! She don't know how to listen to her guests...
Isn't this Megyn Kelly that person who claim that Jesus Christ was white and should only be showed as white? Isn't she the one who makes all types of excuses for police shooting of unharmed black people and claims that it has nothing to do with race.
Show's not going to last !!!
This isn’t about you Megan!! Please ...
Did anyone else feel like the question was really inappropriate? About plastic surgery? I mean really?
The only way a Megyn Kelly talk show could be anywhere near remotely entertaining  is if it involved her stripping down and showing off those floppy, whithered, 46 year old fun bags.\nREPLY
Jane Fonda got more class, brains and beauty today and always, than that intervier Megyn Kelly has.\nThe way Jane Fonda handled that interview was amazing considering it was a full on nasty cut-throat remark by Megyn Kelly.\nI'm with Jane Fonda all the way, and Robert Redford. Just amazing talented people.
Queen Jane shoots down the vile Megyn Kelly. Take this witch back to the slime bucket that is Fox News.
I just don't like Megyn.
LOL.. the fail is strong with this narcissistic blonde twit.
Please come back to Houston
MK sorry, but can you drool over Redford even more?
Totally shocked by Megyn Kelly's announcement at 4.57.  It sounds like she is saying 'Arseholes at night'! Better to emphasise the second word ( 'Souls' ) instead of the first ('Our').
Age!!Age!!!looks!! AGE!LOOKS! MK IS OVER
Kelly is great...who doesn't love watching a clown, just waiting for the fool to show up.
megyn kelly really sucks...more and more...pretty amazing redford's gone from media recluse to showing up on day time chat shows...getting older made even the sundance kid come in from the cold...
why is the camera CONSTANTLY MOVING? distract from what's actually happening on screen maybe? BECAUSE IT SUCKS (the camera and the content). thanks
Jane Fonda is a 10 - in more ways then one. Admirable woman. Great respect for her.
MEGYN KELLY IS TERRIBLE. Awful. Awfully terrible!! Terribly awful. \nGo back to Fox News.
Megyn is a perfect beauty.....
r/cringe
Bye Megyn.
Megyn Kelly is trash lol
Megan Kelly malicious
they look like mummies
Megyn sux! Poor thing
A communist and a hateful feminist walked onto a stage........and then I turned the t.v. off.
Omg that was upsetting to watch
shadow gov. fake tv..
NBC's LATEST DISASTER: MEGYN KELLY 👎.
Jane Fonda just through complete shade...NAHH ..., she threw ABSOLUTE DARKNESS on this ignorant, moron, lawyer turned news anchor, turned entertainment host. Meghan,,dear,,,, CATS are the only creatures to boast about 9 lives, your DONE.
She is a racist and a liar. I will never forget how you purposely inspired racist attacks with race baiting, calling black protesters thugs, saying that all Muslims are terrorists and  inciting people to commit hate crimes all over this nation. You and the rest of the propagandist at fox, both past and present, are covered in blood from all of the attacks and murders caused by your words. You cant hide from your past and who you really are. NBC are trying to normalize these people but DON'T LET THEM. DON'T WATCH ANY SHOW KELLY OR ANYONE WHO THINKS LIKE HER IS ON. SHAME!!!!!!
I think people or the media are making too big of a deal out of this part of the interview. Now that Ive seen it it just wasn't that bad.
JANE IS 😍😍
If they want viewers they need edge, this is not edge, there is no edge on tv anymore!
I personally think MK did a great job, and I’m not even a fan.
Redford looks like an old butch lesbian 😂😂😂
Redford should do a commercial for eyebrow dye for men
Megyn Kelly will never be half the woman Jane Fonda is.  Not to mention the Integrity.
This dyed-blonde skank must be deported to Saudi Arabia ASAP.
It seems like when you're older your age will be rubbed in your face whether it's in a form of compliments or not...Honestly it doesn't need to be constantly pointed out 🙄
jane fonda has everything it takes to become a major political player.\nevery conservative fears jane fonda entering politics.\npelosi / fonda 2020!
Meghan has new charisma with whoever
Jane is funny.  She definitely likes to be the centre of attention with discussion pertaining to her or her co-star referencing her or them, even at her age.   Robert Redford has a good sense of humour.
The feelings culture
i thought Jane Fonda died
All these comments...\nSo much love in this world...\nWow.\nI’d like to see each one of you become an attorney, work for a major news station, and then run your own show.\nNo, she’s not perfect and neither are any of you.\nFor god’s sake it’s her third show-give her a break!\nThis endeavor of hers is entirely new and a completely different style of reporting.
why so much hate. news flash, the jane fonda plastic surgery qs is not a new qs :/

Cool?....
You might have tried different waveforms, like a square wave or sawtooth.  Most of what you show here are two dissonant tones that are creating beat frequencies and interference resulting in some complex waveforms that change amplitude over time.
4:56 think he meant to say AUTO. He said if you set ur camera to MANUAL it will make those calculations for you, pretty sure thats auto!!!! Then at 5:12 he says for tricky things like that to set it to MANUAL!!!! So i set it to.... MANUAL FOR EVERYTHING OR WHAT???!!!!!
It's about how the camera captures the image. Check out smarter everyday. And your mate they both have vids on it
I bet the reason you have breaks in the laser is because the laser is missing the mirror at certain angles.
6:25 Rolling shutter. Smartereveryday has a great video on it.
Sound waves are a 3d object, and what you're presenting is a 2d projection of a 3d object.
You should film it again with a proper video camera that has a so-called global shutter - your problems should be gone.
Great vid...on the side, Ron Smith of N California invented the multiple rotating mirror laser modulator later commercially sold without his credit...happened about 1972
When there are more frames per second we notice that the light is not a continuous path, it is a dots that move along a path.\n\nThis means that when the shutter speed (frames per second) is slow, the light moves along the path a certain distance x, and the camera records this as a continuous path.\n\nBetween frames, no data is picked up. This means that if the light is moving unusably fast, we should expect to see no image for a certain distance y.\n\nThis explains why there are jumps in the path. At these points the light was moving very fast. To fast for the camera to pick up (its shutter was closed during the movement). \n\nThis is supported by the fact that the paths that were missed are all in straight lines. When going around a corner at an unusually high speed, light may still be picked up since it has a width and passes through the same point more than once, increasing its chance pf been recorded. This does not occur for a straight line.
can you strobiscope the mirrtor and membrane for fake slotwmo?
It's almost certainly the rolling shutter effect. Destin from Smarter Everyday did a wonderful video on this exact effect. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNVtMmLlnoE
Just waiting for my cat to get triggered by you saying laser.... maybe your accent...? or she is sleeping? but nothing yet...
6:20 The line issue, at least from my own experience, is probably caused by the fragment of mirror you're using. Since it's a broken chip, the laser could be dipping into an imperfection in the glass itself.
Can you relate this to string theory?
I feel that the multiple end points could be because of high amplitude of the balloon where the laser spot goes out of the mirror for a very small amount of time.
By moving the piece of glass to a different location, you probably get completely different structures.
I'd be really interested to see what a square wave note versus sawtooth or sine wave looks like through this
The multiple starting and stopping is something that happens with digital camera, instead of 1 exposure it's like a sweep
This really looks like an art form unto itself. I have always been fascinated by the fact that we can discern multiple simultaneous frequencies using a single vibrating membrane (eardrum). The miracle is that the cumulative vibrations of the eardrum are then transmitted through three tiny bones to a snail shell like structure filled with fluid and nerve endings and somehow our brains are able to make sense of it all.

Please do this with a pair of theremins
Team up with slow Mo guys
reminds me of the fourth dimension
I wonder if you had multiple of these setups if you could point them all at the same location from a different direction, modify their tones in a certain way, and make a hologram on mist or something where the projection wouldn't be blocked by your hand going in the way.
2:34 this funny pattern here then continues like nothing happened
1st time viewer...\nThat was cool!
I'd love to see a spirograph with pwm and draw photo.
TBH this to me is a great representation of 4th dimensional objects
The multiple start and end, has to do with the way a camera takes a photo. It doesn't take the whole frame at once. It does it in sections.\nSmarter Every Day did a video on this just two months ago. I believe the effect is called the rolling shutter.\nAnyway, here's a link if you wanna see more about it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNVtMmLlnoE
The messy loose ends could be due ot the baloon blocking the light or total internal reflection.
Did you manage to open a portal to another dimension on you wall?
This guy hasn't seen https://www.reddit.com/r/oscilloscopemusic/
Shits fucking trippy I need something telling this when I get some acid
Try painting the wall with glow-in-the-dark paint for a trail
As someone who is fascinated by sound, this is an amazing video. When you added that second pure tone I had a genuine holy shit that is cool moment.
a solution about the several starting point -> the frame is record from top to bottom and this take time
Been a while since I saw a video that qenuinely amazed me.
Try playing some of jerobeam fenderson's music through it
The multiple starts/ends may be to do with the frame capture time exceeding the max integration time of the photosensors' integrators. To avoid saturating the integrators, you camera may be switching in multiple integrator banks, and the gaps you're seeing would be the time taken to perform this switch.\n\nIf you wanted to understand it better, try and set up a repeatable system which allows you to measure the length of the missing pieces of the laser path, then back out the time for each gap from the laser's speed. Alternatively, see if you can't get your hands on a more well documented camera module/sensor. For example, I've worked with the Aptina MT9V034 fairly extensively. Being able to set the registers on its image processor offers quite a bit more control than you'd find in your video camera's manual mode.
The presence of the cutt offs may be explainable because of the beam of the laser might be hit the edge of the mirror.
I bet there's some freaking amazing algebraic polynomial to describe the motion of the laser
About 6:00, it could be because of the rolling shutter. This would then be the same effect as you get with a propellor plane.
I wouldn't be surprised if this is what is going on at the smallest scales of our universe in string theory, strings vibrating at different frequencies which have a different effect on our universe, very interesting video!
It's from rolling shutter. Consumer cameras aren't equipped with processors that can capture every single pixel of a frame of video at once. Instead it rolls and records the pixel information line by line. The camera is processing the pixel information for the full 1/25th of a second, but the vibrations of the laser are so fast, it moves while the camera is saving the pixel data, causing it to appear like more than one line. The only solution would be to use a camera with a global shutter like an URSA Mini or Sony F55. Or you could shoot it with a film camera!
6:01 Do you have a rolling shutter system on your camera ? The thing that makes dark bands under halogen light ^^
Here before this goes viral
Super cool, i have seen the same kind images by creating some nested Spirographs in code a while ago. But that's not as nearly as fast as this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDrhXYcLZ0
Could the laser diode be PWM controlled to save battery? That would explain why you would only see the breaks on the more complicated shapes. Did you see the breaks on simpler shapes?
I think you should add more mirror fragments (3 total) and have different colored lasers that at rest are aligned to all point and the same spot and see what location of the mirror does to the angle of reflection...and it would be pretty :)
Would love to see someone do this with a Phantom slow motion camera.
Reminds me of oscilloscope music.\nIf you haven't seen oscilloscope music i would highly recommend looking it up
the different lazer ends could be that the lazer dosent hit the small mirror and then hits it again
Really cool video, but why didnt you center the mirror? Are you trying to give me a stroke? I cant think of 1 reason
You should have tried a Sheppard's tone
The reason there are mulitple starting points is more than likely the roling shutter effect
I feel like experimenting with the overtone series and circle of fifths would be interesting, as well as using a mylar sheet to mirror the entire resonating surface.
The lose ends could be the mirror which is out of place so that the laser beam just hits the rubber.
That's a big old watermark!
can't put in words how F****** COOL this experiment is\nas an engineer who studies waves I find the way in which auditory and visual inputs are reconciled in his video is just b-e-a-u-t-i-f-u-l
this should be a screen saver
6:15 Because camera sensors scan from top to bottom. This video by Gavin Free explains it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmjeCchGRQo
6:00 it's because of the rolling shutter, talk to your friend Matt Parker, he did a video about it
I'd love to see what the sound of tuning a guitar looks like
Is it possible that the multiple end points might be because of the rolling shutter?
It's very likely the laser is pulsed. The most efficient way to run a laser diode is in pwm mode. Green lasers included. (Which are actually infra-red lasers, pumped into a Nd:YvO4 crystal which doubles the frequency, and then the unwanted wavelength is filtered)
Jerobeam Fenderson oj Youtube makes music that produces such patterns on an oscilloscope. I't looks really nice :D
THIS IS SO COOL
You should film this with a Phantom camera!!! At 10000fps and then we would see the precise movement of the laser.
With the multiple breaks in that still, was the mirror ever moving enough that the laser was only hitting the lid and missing the mirror?
I think the anomaly happens because the lazer is missing the mirror during that period of time.
Do you think the start stop at 6:15 into the video is to do with the size of the mirror fragment?\nAs if the laser comes off the mirror no reflection on the wall.\n\nBrilliant vid, I must try this... Thank you for the idea. :)
multiple cuts of the laser in a single frame seem to be a consequence of the rolling shutter effect
Could it be that loose ends is because the mirror is vibrating far enough away so the laser doesn't hit it?
I wonder what a Shepard Tone looks like with the laser? First Google result on Shepard Tones: (https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/07/the-uncanny-sound-illusion-that-creates-suspense-in-christopher-nolans-movies/)
I think it is because the laser comes of the glass.
//this is a comment\nnice video!
Lissajous figures, look that one up :D
Rolling shutter is what causes the stills with multiple loose ends or starting and ending points. Check out Destin's video for more info. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNVtMmLlnoE
Maybe the line broke in some of them because the mirror's amplitude was too high and the laser missed it?
Amazing! Simple, yet mind blowing.\n\nWould have been nice if you labeled each frequency so we can get an idea of how the frequencies affect the shapes.
The problem might stem from the fact that most digital cameras have pan and scan sensors. Pan and scan read rows of pixels from left to right before moving to the next row and so on. That could be why the faster laser patterns are causing the breakage problem. Because by the time the pixel row below has scanned, the laser is in a different spot. \n\nYou you might be able to try to get around this by filming with a higher shutter speed though that would require testing. If you have an iPhone or Android phone with That capability then that could be a good starting point. If it’s still a problem then you could rent a high end camera with that capability like a Phantom camera. They usually have global shutters. \n\nOr you could try and rent a digital camera with a global shutter, which acts like film cameras by taking a snap of the whole sensor at a time. This type of sensor also helps remove a digital phenomenon called rolling shutter. \n\nHope any of that helps!
It kind of looks like they always form a mobius strip. Is anyone else seeing that?
am I talking to me?
Play the Shepard tone illusion through it.
As to your question, maybe it's the rolling shutter effect.\nIf the shutter is not really open for the full 0.04 second for the whole image but instead it scans it during this time, you might get these results.
6:14 ,why it has so many start and ends ,here is the solution, smarter every day https://youtu.be/dNVtMmLlnoE\n Must watch
this is amazing

this is great but also what
Love grizzly bear version of The Bachelorette starring Aunt Freckle
Busy is stunning
FRECKLE!!! OMG!! YES PLEASE! ❤❤❤❤
Is David Lynch directing Grizzly Bear's music videos?
F R E C K L E
Como não gostar?\n♡\nBrazil here \○/
Is that Busy Phillips?
Love the band, love Busy Phillips, love Aunt Freckle!
YAAAAS, FRECKLE!!! 😍
come to Chile <3
Conceited comment: I prefer the strange vague (almost genderless) sexuality of Knife and Ready, Able to the new music videos. I thought the gender themes on Mourning Sound and (to a lesser extent) on this video were a bit overt, and not particularly insightful. That being said, I did enjoy this video's visual twists, and I'm pretty happy that Grizzly Bear are still in the absurd music-video game.
I adore freckle more than anyone could believe
Freckle is the gayest of all gays ever in the history or future of all gays.
Kim where's Daniel
Crazy video, Freckle's underwater look is hilarious
Wish you guys would come to Lollapalooza Brazil
YES FRECKLE YES
MY BEAUTIFUL DEAR AUNT FRECKLE
YAAAAAS FRECKLE! SLAAAAAAAAY
Ojalá vengan a Colombia 🇨🇴 !!
Are they all trans women ??? Yes beautiful yes
Freckle has hit the big time
God I love Busy Phillips
Beautiful !!! <3 <3 <3 Getting blue velvet vibes during piano scene. So lovely and great song.
Twenty-nine people don't have fucking ears and just watched a video with no context. To them. Just them.\nThank you, Ed, Chris T, Chris B, and Daniel!
is that David Blaine?
kim will always be a bad banana.
You guys see Ed Droste in this video?
What.\n\n\nI need context.
Come through, Freckle! You're a pizza/star! <3
Ed + Frecks. <3 And the girl from White Chicks who is throwing up while that girl holds her hair.
Love love Busy Phillips, confused by vid but still ❤️
this is My Kind Of Content
Video compliments the song very VERY well! Also one of my favorites of the album. Can we get a Glass Hillside video?
Who came here because of typing 'bear'?
this is everything. i love lara and freckle!! so good
Amazing, I really Love this album and the videos 😍😍😍😍💙
best track of the record, looking forward to hearing it performed live :)
I love Aunt Freckle in this
Best song on the album and catchiest tune since Two Weeks. Good Job fellas!
Wow! Great song and video! Is the blonde girl as same as the girl from Yet Again's video?
I believe vídeos are so important and grizzly bear are great on it. This is fucking art!!
Emotive...\nI feel this music. Great album
How not to love their songs?
YAS FRECKLLEEE SLAYYY

Great!
wow
Not first
First off please no one attack me because I am one of the biggest Grizzly Bear fans you could ever meet. \n....\nI don't understand these videos. They used to be psychedelic. I always considered grizzly bear to be psychedelic. Ready,Able is the coolest video I have ever watched whilst under the influences \n  This feels pushy. Don't get me wrong, I am absolutely in no way against anything gay. I'm starting to feel like this whole album is about accepting people for what they are. And I do! But damn I miss the Veckatimist feels.
Wait what what what what what what what  what what what what what what what  what what what what what what what  what what what what what what what
O. M. G. FRECKLE!
Why am I crying in the club right now
Couldn't understand a thing, it's freaking amazing!
It sounds so much like a Father John Misty song that it could be a Father John Misty song
Such a Beatlesque sound
Is this video related to the death of hugh hefner? Both are a symbol of redefining the role of women into society. It would be nice!
Holy shit.
This album is a modern classic.
TFW you realise the singer in the clip is a guy 🤔
Dear Everyone, apologies for the volume of the music. You're right, it IS too loud. That's my bad! I hope you can cope and it doesn't put you off too much because I can't lower it without removing the video and losing all of your lovely comments. So I promise to not do it again next time if you promise to forgive me and watch this video anyway! Xxx
So funny recipe :D and so funny name...flumps! Thanks for sharing this incredible recipe :)
Hi, Jemma! I've baked a lot using your recipes, and everything turned out great. Is there any chance, that you can show us how to make devil's food cake? I really want to try it, and you are the only one I trust.
damn that background music is loud, it's really too bad, i can barely hear you
my new favourite non swear that sounds like swear word.\nwhat the flump is that??? i dont give a flump!!!  get the flump out of here!!! haha love it already
Plz can you do a lemon sherbet recipe
You should totally do merch!!!!!! Imagen it!
I used to get called Flump at work because my hair was pastel blue, pink and yellow and it looked like a Flump when I braided it! :)
Omg it's soooo pretty
Hi
You look like Grace vanderwaal all grown up
Great to see how they’re made but there ain’t no way that I’d go through all THAT palaver for some flumps!!!
The music is really off-putting :(
Yummy yummy yummy.
Great video,  but I think I'll just stick with buying them ready made ;)
Tuck Shops ya! 😊
Jaffa cakes ❤️
I love British accent
I MISSED C&D HQ!!!!
can u make slutty brownies? but like reeeaaalllyy full on ones with like pretzels and honey combs and marshmallows and sprinkles???!!! Xxxxxxxxx
like it
so 24 grams of gelatine.
These look amazing on gingerbread houses.
Flumps look so fun!
ja ja jemma pretty nice recipe
Please do a kinder bueno cupcake emma 😍😍😍
Yor background makes me jealous 😢.
They're 60p in home-bargains.
Sprinkles!
Malteases
Rum and raisin fudge 😍
MashAllah
nice cdg shirt
Aaaah flumps are just my childhood!
Love the commes des garçon top
YES💜
Super cool!!!
Are there vegetarian options? Can I use AgarAgar instead?
Please make cakes based on Indian theme,green tea & red wine please
Love your videos Gemma, u are the best
What type of powdered gelatin is used?
Where i come from we call them wiggles, aaaannd they’re covered in chocolate!
That marshmallow u ate was so from today or the batch u just made.
hard candy ribbons like the kind granny had in the glass jar around christmas time
Really pretty, but I don't really understand why you'd want to eat that.  Lol. :)
I just want to make regular marshmallows, can I skip the glucose since I'll melt them?
Maltesers! Maltesers! Maltesers! Maltesers! Maltesers! Maltesers! Maltesers!  :D I've made your marshmallows so many times (including for my sweetie table at me wedding) and they've always turned out great.
I like flumps but that’s a lot of work and I’m lazy😝 cya I’m off to Tesco
Why would you not just buy flumps? Sm better and cost like 5p
Yeah Gemma, the music is a distraction and a bit annoying.  When I watch your videos I want to relax. Your choice of music on this one is a bit fast, perhaps more appropriate for a work out. Love you anyway xx
which company do you get your sprinkles from in the background? or could you recommend somewhere please! thank you :) and loved the video
Jemma you're the best!! These are absolutely adorable <3
if you don't have friends lmao
I remember twisted coloured marshmallows but never called them flumps...then again I’m from Australia so probz different name
Not as easy as it looks
Hey jemma! I really loooove your videos , I'd like  to know wich Brand are your spatulas and bowls? Please let me know 😊....
This must be a British thing, haha
I loved dots when I was a child. Colorful and so much fun to tear off the paper and eat
that background music is too loud
Loved the vid but the music too loud over your voice.
If your going to learn one candy recipe this is the one to learn. So nice and yummy. Nice video, Love all your videos
And where do I store them, in a paper bag or a plastic one?
@CupcakeJemma I use to have nougat with jube pieces in it. Maybe you can make that for one of your episodes. 😊😊
Cupcake jemma a very very important qns \nIs it possible to over whip butter? And make it spoil or something by making too pale?
Your phone case so pretty 😍
What's your star sign
i love it so much
Can you swap the gelatine for vege - gel?
we call these spekkies in my country!
Love it so much😱❤\nPlease you can do video on mirror cake?
you are so quick bae
I absolutely love your videos. You give me such inspiration for me to get in the kitchen and make some of your recipes. Thank You so much.😀💜
These look so delicious except I can't find powered gelatin anywhere!!! Pls help!
I missed Cadburys Spiral bars. Made great straws to drink chocolate milk with
I use to eat those when I was 2 years old and I don't see them any more and they taste so good they are awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can't wait to see what you're going to do for halloween this year!
Any one else notice how perfect and equal Jemmas were compared to the other girls (5:19) lol you can tell she's a master!!!
Highkey can't wait for all the halloween masterpieces this year😭😭😭😍
I love how the entire table ends up pure white from the icing sugar/corn flour mixture. That's definitely a liberal application! (And makes complete sense, marshmallows just get so sticky.)\n\nAlso, yes, we should all take tea breaks while baking!
In the netherlands that’s called “spekjes “
Sick video can you do a recipe on a classic millionare shortbread thingy😂... Please\nAlso are they worth all the effort
you hsould do a video on popular childhood sweets- maybe fruit winders? i know they could be quite simple but i am really interested to find out
HI JEMMA❤❤ I love your videos so so much!! Lots of love from Mexico 🇲🇽✨🎉 btw can you make some macarons please!😄😍😘
Love your video's but I have one complaint.  Please either remove the back ground music or at least lower the volume.  It interferes with your talking. Again, I love your video's!
Oooh! Flumps! Not had a flump in years lol, god I sound old. Gonna have to give this a go!
I have always loved flumps but this is a hard recipe for my hands (I have rheumatoid arthritis) maybe I could find someone to give these a try for me. I had some shop bought ones not too long ago and they were nasty I couldn't eat them they weren't proper flumps.
Nice editing and a really nice recipe! You guys are awesome! X
Great recipe but the background music was a terrible idea
Flumps is a fun word to say. Flumps lol. Also, I don't really like marshmallow but I kind of want a flump now lol.
Looks so difficult but fun to do lol \nThanks for your video
Will it work the same with vegan gelatine? X
Is that merchandise jemma?!?
Is corn flour the same like corn starch
She swallows quick...... I like her.
Please make something eggless!!
Hi jemma. I tried this reciepe and the smell and taste of gelatin was really overpowering.. it smelt plastic-y and was just strong.  i added heaps of vanilla but that didnt help. Any tips to change that?
Where did you get your cell skin?
Ok, first there was the kitchen towel (mega cool) and now the cell phone case 😍 !!! Looks like Johnny cupcakes designed it (correct?). Was this designed specially for you, or is it available in his shops? Love your videos :) all the best from Germany
Or just go to Tesco's and buy one for 10p
Yeah cos we've all got a 6ft long work counter..
Play Christensen regularly he's our next great center back.
Batshuayi is brilliant but Morata is better, well done Chelsea for beating Atletico Madrid in their new stadium it was magic so very happy 😊
If Batshuayi worked on his movement, he could compete with Morata as his finishing is just as good. Morata's movement is on another level though.
Play Musonda more
Every week I watch these videos William is always doing skills, does he even concentrate on actual football
Willian should definitely start his YouTube channel side by side similar to F2 Freestylers...
COME ON CHELSEA 🔵💙
Victor Moses can speak
Well done boys! Lets beat city 💪💪
David Luiz 😂😂 0:11
Play musonda ..it will be fun seeing delph chase him for 10 or so mins
Willian should practise passing and not those stupid skills
Aguero got in a car accident
Please play Kenedy and musonda more
Willian should be behind Musonda in the squad has any one noticed Willian gives the ball up after Chelsea push forward all time with him in attack he passes or shows of to much and looses possession no disrespect his a great player but we’ve got better and his wasting to many chances in such critical games
Michy is still young n has plenty of room to improve his football at chelsea fc. He will soon become a star at the club.
Chelsea❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Chelsea squad 11 12 =< Chelsea squad now\n\nAre they gonna win ucl
*MORATA >>>>>>>>>>> Aguero*
Willian should create a YouTube Football Freestyle Channel because that's all he's about these days & leave football for men, smh
We deserved more goals but well played chelsea. Our dominance in the game was crazy.\n#ktbffh\n#coyb
Michy doesn't know how to play with his strengths. Otherwise he would have been a good player. Atm he is just average.
Who's ready to for FIFA 18 today and Wreck teams with Chelsea FC!?
Show more of hazard in training
4:17\nwhy two pairs for the match? does he change them at half-time?
Mitchy is too fat! Get some fat loss diet & exercise!
This channel needs more content same thing every week\n We need more in depth look. Also longer footage
Let's pick up where we left off boys!
Cahill well played on Wednesday. You deserve more credit sometimes
The Wanda Metropolitano is no joke, that is one fresh, footballing arena!
only 2 days preparation for the city game is a joke!!! but i believe in the boys to get the win. #COYB💙💙
Does anyone know what sneakers Morata is wearing? The white ones? Looks like Addidas
Bats has to rethink his bags lol
Some of ya'll so disrespectful, Willian has carried the team by himself so many times when they other players are under performing. The most consistent player in our shirt for the pass 5years. #FakeFans 😡
Been noticing Batshuayi wearing old F50 boots why is that ?
Все равно Батшуаи деревянный!!!))))
Come on boys, same ting as last years let’s sweep City under the rug.
People bashing on Willian are total idiots. They guy is amazing and he can practice the skills if he wants.. Yes, sometimes he does silly things. Don't attack him. Every player does mistakes.
Willian works very hard
Boys lets focus city game
Williann ...... 🙄🙄🙄
CHEELLLSSEEEAAAAAA
lovely
Batshuayi = training legend
Chelsea 💙💙
Esse David Luiz 😂😂😂
Batschuayi on wednesday night made me happy for the first time in UEFA champions league since 2012
Morata or lukaku?
Michy on fire🔥
IF YOU SUPORT CHELSEA COMMENT UNDER THIS CHELSEA ARE THE BEST
Breaking News Aguero got in a car accident and is out for two months. He won't be playing against Chelsea. 😫😫😫😭😭😭
Sou brasileiro, mais amo o Chelsea desde pequeno.\nVamos, vamos Chelsea  blue
willian should improve in playing always concentrates on dribbling
I love the fact they are training at the stadium. Very shrewd move by Conte. All teams should be doing this to make their home stadium a fortress.
Goodbye zuma
HAZARD <> MORATA <> MUSONDA
Morata, Pedro and Alonso are besties
This is adorable Zoe and the little mermaid and seahorse are so cute. Beautiful cake. Tfs 🤗👍🏻😊👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

Beautiful  job!
Beautiful as always
Awesome video
can u plz do a wolfcake
perfeito
This cake is beautiful as are all of your works. If you take requests or ideas could you do characters from a cartoon called Kate and Mim-mim? There are 6 main characters, Kate, Mim-mim, Tac, Gobble, Lily, and Boomer. I think they are adorable and the colors of the land they live in, Mimaloo, are so vibrant. I think you could do an amazing job with these characters.
Y are the best cake designer .. love you from Iraqi ❤
Nicely done, Zoe! I like the textured sides made to look like waves. Those little details (and the overall artistic ability) really separates a grocery store cake vs your creations.
much puppy
Fantastic!!!!
Молодец!
Che amore !!!!!!! 😍😍😍😍
Awesome tutorial Zoe! This is so cute! 😋
Love your work!!
Now, I know it takes you more than 5 minutes to pull these things together, but you make it look so easy!  I love your designs, and this one is no exception!  <3
Everything you do is so original Zoe. That's what I love most about your channel. Keep going. Counting down to your shop opening. So excited for you. Wish you infinite success. Love ya.
You are Awesome!
As always, it looks soooo amazing.
Truly amazing!

Hi, Zoe. Your mermaid cake looks beautiful, just like you. Thanks again for another lovely cake.
Amazing as usual and I love that you cater for all levels of skills
That seahorse is so adorable! Zoey I've been with you for a long time now and yet you continue to amaze me with your talent, keep it up! 🙂
Yeh I'm the first
Hugh, went str8 to hell..
He saw more titties than anyone on the planet
People often say that those who have dies are in a better place. This will not be said for him.
I'm so sad for Hef, he a great Playboy king, he gets golden.
More like hugh just left heaven.
RIP Hef the King of Playboy
And life goes on.............
Rip! A Playboy bunny tattoo now for me 😎
All these feminist in the comment section lol 😂
Huh well that sucks for the people that loved him. But since I never knew him well you went down as you lived as a playboy.
He made the world worse made it disgusting
I actually hate cringey feminists but everyone knows God doesn’t want him
About the only thing worse than this perverted bastard is the moral-less, classless, clueless, nasty ass bunch of tramps who sold their soul right along with Hugh.. For broad is the path and wide is the gate that leads to destruction, and many will enter in..
HE is burning in HELL for his wickedness!!!!! He was a key figure in the moral decline of our society he was a filthy wretch!!!!!
Can everyone stop staying rot in hell the mans dead ffs
Rest In Peace Hugh he having good time with Satan or Heaven party like a legend.
rest in peace hugh hefner your playboy products and tv show will continue to live on thanks for all the wonderful things you did for us men and woman bout makeing woman all over the world look more beautiful with their skin as well as thier clothing go in peace my friend my heart goes out to the hefner family and i hope hefner  legacy will continue to live on
Straight to hell where he deserves to be :(
He was a degenerate
The excess Viagra moved beyond his penis and throughout his body causing one big stiffy.
Back in the summer2016  went highland I saw a girl  wearing playboy playmate she had big boobs and my November trip to Las Vegas I saw hot womens strip clubs and wow rest in peace Hugh Hefner
Haha i am not fat haha any one uses women for their sick fantasy  aint nothing but trash
All you Christian feminazis need to shut your fucking mouth and show some respect to someone that just died you immoral scum.
whats with the sad music in the background.........
Wow, the hell wait for hugh, burn forever.
THE GUY WAS A WALKING AND TALKING CORPSE BEFORE HE EVEN DIED.....I WOULD THINK THAT WOULD SPEAK FOR ITS SELF BUT YOU PEOPLE LIKE TO DEFEND WALKING AND TALKING GHOSTS.
Christian warns Hugh Hefner before his death to repent and believe the gospel...NOW HE IS IN HELLFIRE ! https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=40&v=6vKw7kp-vIg
In honor of Hugh, everybody give their wife or girlfriend a nut shot in the face tonight  !
at least they no longer have to suck his old dry dick
He got all that pussy back then!!
if you die a millionaire...youre probably going to...oh hell no! where you have to eat second rate pussy! and the women have semi non semetrical breasts! an alternate universe where donald trump is fred durst and fred durst is ted nugent...and where athletics are forced upon all people..even jumping jacks....and none of the women have blonde hair! none! but thanks to technology that world is made of plastic...the sex toy industry has officially secured hell...so he probably went to italy.
his penis will be missed
Has any of his women died?
Everyone saying R.I.P,  no he's not resting lol
Well he is finally stiff again
Hefner died having his last orgasm, jizzing on one of the awesome faces of his many bunnies. R.I.P
dead. good. should have died along time ago. a disgrace to us men & manhood who respect women.  he was a piece of rubbish. good riddance.
Died with his dick in some underage girl. Nasty prick.
He died doing what he loved...looking at and fucking women
At least Hell has one less vacancy
This man is *not* living in a better place. Where do you go from here? He hit his peak after 91 years
1926? dang I bet he kicked it with Charlie Chaplin
I just got a commercial for the movie Happy Death Day like way to go YouTube! Great timing!
People some loved him and some people hated him. That is the Hugh Hefner legacy. I'm sorry for his family loss. His name will live on.
and busting hell wide ass open.
Died from massive erection
HILLARY 4 PRISON
R.I.P. HEF
died on hump day..lol.isnt that ironic
From these comments I can see why women are becoming more feminist.
😿☠️
LARRY KKING TWEETED\nHE WAS A SEXY ICON
Why are there 30 dislikes?
now burn in hell
Rest in hell
#RIP Big Man! 😭🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻😭😭😭💋💋💋💋💋 #HughHefner
Dirty old man!
Icon.
What a life!!!
RIP
RIP The G.O.A.T
Why should anyone care?
Hugh Marston Hefner WAS NOTHING but a pimp.
Good riddance freak. Burn Hefner Burn
So many Feminists and Christanists in this comment section celebrating. \nNo wonder why your hero Hillary Lost!\n(Not a Trumpeter, I don't like him either).
Mixed feelings rest in peace
No way you can say he’s going to a better place because he was in a better place at the playboy mansion.
RIP The Heff: The World's Greatest Player.
I'm sorry but I cannot mourn the death of a man who spent most of his life objectifying women... he was a nasty nasty man...
For all y'all religious ppl saying he will burn in hell are ridiculous y'all act like y'all know what this man did in his entire life to help the world in any way he probably did way more than you fake ass christians ever did have any of yall donated before? What about help someone through college, the poor and homeless??? All y'all do is point y'all figures I pray y'all religious beliefs become y'all reality after death just like the Bible sayhe who cast the first stone shall be judged first so  I pray y'all be judged for every rock thrown yall toxic judgemental human beings clean your own shit first then worry about others Ike your preachers who's molesting children and stealing money which in my eye  is much worst than Hugh Hefner 🤷🏽‍♂️
The world is better off without him.
Wonder if he went to hell. He was a womanizer. I went to his old high school in Chicago graduated in 2009. The principal swore he donated a million to the high school she must of spent the cash on herself because nothing was updated at the school.
This comment section is full of a bunch of cucks, and fat ugly bitches who get no sex. I have nothing but respect for the man he achieved his dreams despite criticism and controversy. He made a fortune and slept with beautiful young women. RIP Hugh.
A great man died
Any libshit on here who praises this man and condemns Trump for equivalent behavior is the biggest hypocrite on the planet. Further proof that liberals are animals.
It's about time, women are better off without him. He will now answer to God for his continued sinful ways.
Glad that piece of shit is dead. He brought out feminist movement. He also paid women to pretend to be in love with shit. This world will be a better place without him
Rest In Peace you lucky bastard! You will be missed!
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
THE MOST RESPECT PIMP IN THE WORLD,,REST IN PEACE.
This man enjoy every day of his life!!! My condolences to relatives....
Nobody can say he's in a better place
Rest easy brother ill take over from here ;)
Dude has knocked out more pussy then Bill Cosby
*REST IN PUSSY*
R.I.P. HUGH HEFNER 1926-2017 \nYOU'LL WILL FOREVER BE MISSED. THANK YOU, GOD BLESS YOU & FAREWELL MY FRIEND! 😢😢😢😢😢😇😇😇😇😇
for all the zealots releasing their vitriolic fire and brimstone.... here is a quote :  Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.
So heartbreaking
Finally old fart
Yuck
FUCK HIM\nBLOODY PERVERT
Good riddance. He was a sexist pig who treated women like objects whereas women are just as mentally and physically strong as men. Also women have the ability to bring new life into this world whereas men only destroy such life. More stories on LGBTQIA+, POC & women's rights and less on dead perverts please!!
Jesus he sexualize women and other women believe they had to be perfect. Because of Playboy many women got plastic surgery porn got more and more popular it was just ridiculous. He's a pervert
Pornography can lower the sense of self-esteem and self-worth of the wife because she may compare herself to the women that her husband is viewing on the screen.  She sees it as a slippery slope to addiction. It may also lead to an increase in the progression of rougher or more deviant sex. This contributes to the husband becoming more focused on his needs and not those of his wife.\n\nAll of the experts agree that a detachment of emotion during sex, and detachment from the relationship as a whole, is very dangerous to the viability of the marriage. Pornography is a poor substitute for the bonding version of sex.
R.i.p
And are we sad about this
RIP, Hef. You will\nbe sorely missed.
R.I.P Hugh \n\n\n\n\n\nHe will never be forgotten.
His soul will not be resting. Hope he repented.
I need someone to formally educate me cause I see a lot of negative comments. Did Hugh abuse the women he worked with, or something bad? Because to say he deserves to rot in hell just because he's the founder of playboy is not reasonable at all.
I am so ready for this.
Oh my God Nicole is just EVERYWHERE! So proud of this woman. Congratulations on your recent strings of success!
A24, you had my curiosity. Now you have my attention.
Aint that the dude in Dunkirk ..?
I think I always say this after every trailer but I love A24!
Yorgos Lanthimos is a fucking genius filmmaker
Colin Farrells beard godamn.
God damn if it's anything like The Lobster count me in
Jesus im so excited for this one!!!
So when do we see some deer action in this film?
I love almost movie you guys have made so far! All original, well done, and entertaining! I'm definitely going to see this one in theaters as well! The only complaint I would have is to not do what you guys did with It Comes At Night for any of your movies ever again. The trailer was misleading and because of that it got trashed on by the casual audience who went to go see it, which is a shame, since it was a really good movie.
I seriously want to watch this movie, but I'm afraid it's not going to be shown in mainstream cinemas in Germany :(
And people say there are no more original films
I love Yorgos Lanthimos.
In a world of relying on loud noises (IT) and unneeded gore (Mother!), A24 is back again to save the day. This is gonna be B-R-I-L-L-I-A-N-T
YO EVERYBODY\nIf you liked The Lobster, \nWATCH DOGTOOTH
Wow this looks good, and it's coming out on my birthday
I agree
This looks awesome.
Fucked up.
Absolutely fucking brilliant - that's my kinda review
Young Barry Keoghan is a superb actor.  Loved him in Irish gangland series LOVE/HATE. He has also been in Dunkirk, Trespass Against Us (with Michael Fassbender and Brendan Gleeson) and 71, with Jack O'Connell
Dunkirk 2: George in Heaven is looking really interesting
I have no idea what is going on but I'm all in.
not as good as the lobster, but still pretty interesting and creepy at some points. never really scary, but the acting is great and it looks good.
One of the best directors right now.
I still don't know anything about the films plot and I can't wait for it. It looks brilliant
How could Barry's name not be mentioned in the end with the rest wtf
The guy from Dunkirk❕❗️❕❗️
So God Damn tense I love it
I don't get it.
Έχουμε καβλώσει!
A24 is best girl
DAAAAD, Bob's dying !
So fucking haunting. Chills.
Love more with hot couple on screen * Nicolin * after watched THE BEGUILED movie
Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman were recently in another film together, The Beguiled. It's fantastic, must watch.
I am waitingggggggggggggggggg
This looks fucking amazing
Can't wait!
Bless
This looks great
This is the most sinister trailer I have ever seen.
Yes, this one. I wanna see this.
*WE ARE GOING TO WAR GEORGE*
This is going to be so awesome
saw this at TIFF and HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND
The sequel to The Lobster?
I loved that as fucked up as it's looking it's still trying to make you laugh
Oh, look! It's the stairs kid from Dunkirk!
THE SINGING GETS MORE AND MORE CREEPER
can't do less Kubrick-esque
GOOSEBUMPS!
Duuuuuuudee this movies gonna kill it!!!! Love A24
And way to spoil the twist, A24. Good job.
I can’t wait for seeing this’ll movie
Thought he was blind and dead.
Dad your son is fucking dying...I think he needs some help...He is bleeding from the eyes!!!. Shit
Hank Hill voice: 'something's not right with that boy, tell you what
That's the little girl from Tomorrowland!
Nicole Kidman is literally everywhere now
lol everyone thinking they're cinephiles because they support A24
please release it in india
Holy shit the cinematography is so good
Yorgos Lanthimos is already a legend to me
So here we r bcoz its from A24 nd we r loving it..hit like if u agree
yall dick riding A24 like they're the ones making these movies.  Give Yorgos Lanthimos some credit here, A24 is just the distributor
Such a weird looking movie but definitely gonna check it out out of curiosity
This does look interesting, but the acting seems a little off for how talented the actors are so I assume it was intentional. It just seems like one of those movies where all your questions and the mystery is revealed in a single scene and you could get most of the story in just a few minutes. Its just about the tension and not knowing.
After that movie it comes at night and a ghost story I'll never watch another movie by this shitty ass production company. Worst movies I've seen in a long time and the acting is laughable
why does a24 only make massive piles of shit?
Hey....HEY MAN, nice shirt.\n\nedit: the thumbnail for this video looks like a weiner
Yo! Prepare some fully loaded nachos...with nothing but a sick home-built laser cutter.
Make bacon with a laser next please
I just spent more time watching a Shaw unlimited data plan ad than I did watching the video
The real question is can the laser do ASMR
i feel like this is what mark watney did after like 1 day on mars with too much equipment and 12 potatoe
William! I need a shirt! Some ruffian stole my plastic bag shirt and now I am nude.
You should  laser cut a laser pointer
Make grilled cheese with the laser
Yeah, that's kinda why you don't want to leave power tools and gadgets that have high voltage wires in a messy environment. Shit gets real, fast. Speaking of which, I need to clean my room...
make a remote control chicken
That time you realize what the thumbnail is supposed to look like after you watch the video 😑
Let me get a shirt
Where can i get the octopus arm he uses?
What metals can your laser cut?
Hey William, umm I was looking at your patreon and I want your dog but I only have $515,396,075.28 ($42,949,672.94 per month for a year) and not $515,396,075.40 ($42,949,672.95 per month)I would really appreciate it if you could bring down the price for the dog to a reasonable price of maybe...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$2 a month plz
Is this guy like a genius engineer that acts stupid for the camera?
GIANT PROPELLER BACKPACK! I made one and it works great! Its also terrifying and I nearly knocked someone over with the amount of air it pushes hahaha ps: it pushes me on my bike and longboard
May there be a twitter made, Mr.Osman?
I would eat those potato chips, as long as the guys came also😉
This is my first time watching this channel but whats with the tentacle dildo
Im a regular person... I see potatoes I click
put some  oil on it first! i think this might actually be possible
Make the head massage tool from your power eraser!!!
Make a human hand and cut it up for a scenario. If you accidentally put your finger through the laser
Can your laser cut another laser?
Please wear cyclops glasses... for educational purposes
you want a bag for this? - i like potatoes lmao
Do you want a bag? I like potatoes
Hey William, i have suggestion. Coming from your Wallace and Gromit video you did with Binging with Babish. You should make a handheld gun/launcher out of a toaster, that will fire toast. Doesn't have to necessarily toast the toast before it's shot, but you do you.
MAKE A HAND HELD LASER CUTTER
I think it would be cool to see you make a plasma popper!
Can it heat up a cup of tea...
You should try and cook a laser breakfast. Try and cook the eggs and bacon. Also try and toast a slice of bread
nice lil idubbbz gag in the beginning
Can a laser suck my dick is the real question
...What a weird channel I've found...
A compound found in potatoes called solanine can cause stomach pains and even paralysis. not enough in one potato, a bite or a even taste, well maybe some stomach pain... i just say so ppl know and don't try to eat a lot 'em at home and end up poison or worst.
I thought it was a Grant Thompson video
if isaac brock put his goofy energy into making stupid shit instead of making stupid music, then I think he'd just be you\n\ni love you dad
was #43 on trending because of the half naked dudes?
Maby if you fucking organize your shit not so much stuff would break and the chance of fire whould go down
LASER EXPERIMENT: \n\nUse the laser to heat oil to deep fry? I feel like it’s the one way to cook with the laser and make good food :p
Q: Is there an `e` on the end of Potatoe?\n\nA: Only if you're Dan Quayle.
Worried about you, Will. In a prior video the high voltage alligator clip you use melted and was arcing to the frame and this time the power supply cable could have done the same. I know you won't have time to show this on camera but i'd recommend checking all the relevant power supply cables just to make sure you don't fry yourself or cameraman John.
He's like if HowToBasic and VSauce3 morphed into one and I love it.
It's demonitized because it hurts Irish people to watch this, your burning their heritage
Isn't weird how he's roommates with Ryan Gosling?
Can you make a giant tc cat that has you on its shirt
Cut a fidget spinner with a laser while it’s spinning
You should use your laser cutter to make some shelves for all the stuff that's always blocking the laser/surrounding area.
Janky is relative. The relative jank, though...is still pretty high.
You should do can a laser cut through metal
YOU SHOULD FRY AN EGG WITH YOUR HOMEMADE 80 WATT LASER CUTTING MACHINE
William osman, you made the Philip defranco show
Wow !! Dick Potatoes??? Damn i need more sleep..😥😥
dear god how have they not burned down the building or electrocuted themselves........
I needed that In the thumbnail I thought you were lasering a dick
You got on the defranco show!
I love your show, and I love your shirts! Send me one please! I'll be your best friend, forever.
Make batman out of potatoes using anything but knives
where can you buy that tshirt?
tl;dr: Yes, but it's shit
“If there is anything that embodies every aspect of the artist that has ever come under discussion—love of innovation, creativity, spontaneity, productivity, creation complete from within oneself, etc.—it is the potato.” -Friedrich Huebach
Cut a mirror with the laser
Thought that was a penis just then. 😂😂
You should laser cut stew ingredients and then make a laser stew!\n\nCarrots, potatoes, meats, onions, salt :3
I dont think thats a potato...(on thumb nail) is the way to make your self have that tingly feeling?
How have you not been in my life until now?
ur neighbors be gay
feels like an idubbbz cooking show
0:04 how to basic
You should make a video where you clean that room and show us all that crap you have in there
Penis tater.
Want more cat shirts now
Niggward tentacles
I feel as though Wills secretly HowToBasic...
hi
po-tay-to po-taa-to
Boi

This dude's like...kinda like...half a retard right? I mean...that would make more sense and shit.
I love your cat shirts. I bought my brother in law one that said thug life and one that shows a polar bear and a black bear looking sexily at one another and it says Let's make a panda. I appreciate your style.
Can you try engraving inside of a block of glass?
Hey congrats with defranco.

RAW
A-F***ING-MAZING pure 🔥🔥🔥
Motivational stuff
2 WAYS ON THE STREETS SHITS YOU BE DEAD OR PRISON MOST DEFINITELY.
Stormzy just tells the truth about everything its what grime should be
yea stormzy we're gonna need a separate video for bad boys
which songs are in there?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Sky sports football commentator... Lukakuuuuuuuu
Who Jah Bless
Dopee
more of a long music video than a film
When KSI and Lukaku have a child
Jheez, what a role model this man is. GQ man of the year? No-one came close....
Amazing,stormz is gonna change nations round
One  of   the best films I have ever seen that combines the blood of the street with the spirit of philosophy. Who  Jah bless...tindrum13
Visual  masterpiece
This is banging bro
Ghana Ghana

Visual rap album.
1k HATERS YEH?  Stormzy u d man
Wow this will explode. This is amazing.
Much love from the states fam
New album from Bugzy and geovarn check this out is lit \nhttps://youtu.be/CoIa__NqNkE
Basit is my mate goes to same school
This goes hard, soooooooo hard, I Finna watch this again that how good it is.
You killed someone???
Lukaku🔥🔥🔥
This is brilliant Stormzy.
This is basically a bunch of raps this aint a movies
Nice...love the message nuff love from Ny❤️
Stormzy Just raised the bar like if you agree 💪
God didn't give you to hands to sit around praying 😶
Message in the beginning was so amazing
The people chatting shit about this album don't get it. Stormzy went against the demand for a hard banger album and wanted to make something that he actually wanted to make. This has a lot more meaning than other UK rap albums. It's an excellent album.
Tony is Konan in 20 years (only in looks)
I swear the boy goes to my school 😂
What is the first song called
Is there no heights that the problem won't reach...
Stormzy should do when plan b did with ill manors release and album make a film filmed with the music
rate this so much wish it was longer will definitely win awards
Best short film I ever watched
THIS IS SOME GOOD SHIT RIGHT THERE
that womans voice at the start though...fucking hell...no one talks like that
This man is MY HERO.
Im 16 right now and I ain't really had a bad life it's been good just always been short on money so my family struggles a little and this film really helped me because   recently I've not been in the right state of mind like I've been on the edge of throwing away my life and getting involved in things I shouldn't because of the way society is nowadays it just glamorises this kind of badman life and I was seriously considering getting involved in it like one sentence and my life could've been changed In a moment but this film brought me back to reality it really did and I feel it saved me it's a great message man and I think more people need to see this
This is hard but it need to be longer
may the GOD OF JEHOVA guide you? this is a video to misguide you all god does not have a god. following things like sheep becuase it sounds good. educate your minds you fools. www.evilbible.com
The young man has got his head screwed on, a blessed message. Respect stormzy
massive message being sent out by stormzy. man is real and a perfect example that it doesnt matter were you are from who your around and what your involved in. its up to you to choose your path find your power your energy and create your own faith and strength and defeat your demons and decide are you worth or waste .
Man's on a different radar

The coach scenes remind me too much of FIFA journeys
My absolute love, Stormz out here living life 🙌🙌 inspiration
Same old shit, different goon on the mic
THIS SONG WILL WIN SOME TYPE OF AWARD. \nInstagram @therealangelafang
Did anyone else notice lines from other artists in the dialogue? \n\nGo back and watch it again...
the concept of this is so revolutionary in grime, making productions like this is really giving grime the right vision that these mc's dj's producer's arent all gangsters involved in crime or living up to that steereotype, it shows the talent this genre called 'Grime' has real raw talent who can make big movements and make good money and make a success out of it \n\nbig up stormzy for showing people how much potential is in GRIME
Lame af
jehova...corbyn..you get me ..what a pile of shit = stormzy the low iq idiot
Stormzy just set new levels for the scene!!! This is Heavy 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 Gwaaaan B!!!!
So vegans are bad for the planet and I should keep eating meat? Got it.
Your voice is putting me on edge
Farms are not working out well in recent years because we stopped puting animal shit in them. And that breaks the cycle.
what about fogponics?\nThe idea is that you mist nutrient water into plant roots, which is way more efficient than hydroponics.
Easy, get a replicator, or just go down to Quarks.
That space will not be a good ecosystem. Let's farm stuff underground by pumping sucrose into genetically engineered plants  and use the above ground space for mostly nature and humans.
This is why veganism is bad.
Permaculture
I was hoping that this video was going to discuss aquaponics. I see a sustainable future there.
Now that I see that there are an Alex, a Henry and a Peter Reich, which one is... the third Reich?
all of this has been tried and failed and many died of stavation. what a load of crap. all wishful thinking and no science.
Drug suppliers are pioneers of these techniques
If you do that mixing of natural habitats with plantations some species will begin to take advantage of the huge amount of protein and energy in the human crops and pesticides and other undesirable methods will have to be used. I think it is a stupid idea. The only possible approach to all these problems is to reduce the global human population to acceptable levels, especially in China, India and Africa.
To keep up to date with agriculture technology. I recommend this podcast, Talking Biotech.\nhttp://www.talkingbiotechpodcast.com/
How TF are we losing dirt?! If it blows away then wont it just fly into another field?
Ok but doesn't that make harvesting 100 times more difficult?
...Always has been? Historically, farming founded the entire history of mankind lol. Your suggestion that the whole (farming) world simply give up their trade and move on...is about as condescending as my suggesting you take a deep breath and consider the livelihood of billions of people across, erm, planet Earth. A (very well researched!) scientific approach to global issues is indeed brilliant but the way you point it out suggests a this is fact, therefore you change approach. Your ideas work in theory, just as farmers own realities work for them, in practicality. Try analysing wealth distribution - if you really want to rock the world :)
Bugs, im calling it right here, the answer is bugs. Eat lots and lots of bugs.
farming is broken because not enough modified plants are being grown?\n\nseriously?\n\nmy bullshit detector is going off....
I have been hearing about perennial grains for a long time. Where are they? What is stopping you? You can splice the DNA of anything into anything else. Do it! Stop procrastinating! \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
We wouldn't have to farm so intensively if the grind to get to old age wasn't so bad. Have you seen how many calorxps you need to get to level/age 80?
Lazy farmers 500 years ago..: Lets delay this like ppl will do with Half-life !
The invention of agriculture was a mistake.
none of this is true I live in the farming capital of america if youve eaten lettuce in america it came from Yuma az. farming is ahead of the game, this is all horse shit. Stupid propaganda,
Food forests 👍🏻\nFruit is the best thing to eat anyway ;)   Good fruit :)
Hi minute earth, this reminded me of a farming technique called aquaponics, which uses 95% less water than conventional farming. It would be really cool I'd you guys did a video on that
Earth is still on beta test so give Jesus some break.
The key to more efficient and environmentally-friendly farming is (and always has been) technology.\nThere is a misconception among non-farmers that 'organic' farming has less of an environmental impact, when the opposite is true. The ability to get amazing yields using less land, less equipment, and less diesel is why technology is so important to agriculture, especially sustainable agriculture.\nWhen people rally against safe and proven agricultural technology such as GMO's, they aren't just trying to make agriculture less efficient; they are inadvertently making it harder to feed the world and save the environment.
America alone produces enough grain to feed 10 billion people, but most of it is fed to farm animals instead and nearly half of the remaining food is wasted in other ways. People are starving to death right now because you choose to eat meat, wasting all that grain
Let's just become hunter-gatherers again
Jesse Agar from This Place was the guest artist!
why is moon white?why do cat say meow?why are we called humans?why am i asking stupid questions?\nok im done bye
Well, I'll finally achieve my weight loss goal :D .. And die
Hey, look at that, a millennial way of pushing GMO's. Profiteers broke farming.
For all the people mentioning hydroponics as a solution: It doesn't solve the problem that nutrients aren't being recycled.
This self sustaining system dose not exist on a large scale. Or world wide scale
Ok, so stop breeding in excess of two children per two adults
It's not easy to switch crops it will consume a lot of land and give a small harvest it will also attract more pest to the land so I don't think farmers will adopt it very quickly specially in India
So when we mow the grass, we harvest off wheat ears?  Makes sense to me.
Trump 2020.  Make America great again, again!
Have to fix the anti-gmo folks first.
2:16 I want a fruit vac
Better idea: Use gene editing to grow meat on trees. And no, I am not joking.
Yep, vegans are destroying the planet.  That's what happens when a bunch of people force themselves into an unnatural diet.  Honestly, though, if people would stop freaking out so much about synthetic foods, we would not have problems like this at all.
Oh shit Interstellar is coming closer and closer to us
Piss off hippies. I will run my big ass truck all I want
Holy shit, someone better tell the thousands of generations of farmers since antiquity that a science YouTube channel has it all figured out.
The name for what this video is about is permaculture.
Well I'll be dead who cares
This is going to fail spectacularly if anyone tries to adapt this to a larger scale than what would be required to sustain a small township. Not saying it isn't a great idea, just saying it ain't feasible at this point. Not sure if they've noticed but creating thriving self-replenishing eco-systems is really, really hard and keeping a precise balance that maximizes our food output against competition from the symbiotic flora and fauna, as well as pest species, would be a whole new kind of complicated and labor intensive on a large scale. Upside is it would probably create a lot of unskilled jobs in the agricultural sector as it would make the high volume use of pesticides and herbicides nigh impossible due to the risk of harming the species that you want to keep around, meaning you will need people out there targeting specific problem areas until we can replace them with drones. Unfortunately that means your already inflated grocery bill is gonna grow a lot bigger.\n\nThis is going to look great on paper and in small scale experiments, it's definitely going to have its partisans.
One day we may have to switch to genetically engineered algae with all of the essential proteins and nutrients in it grown in large vats and shape to look like normal food kind of like what they do with tofu. That's just an idea
Current farming techniques are seriously damaging to the environment, sure. But the problem we face is that any proposed replacement technique will need to produce an equal or greater amount of food within the same time-frame, or huge numbers of people will starve to death. I've seen lots of neat, eco-friendly ideas talked about, but many of them just can't guarantee that they'll be worth the investment of time and resources they would require. We can't afford the death-toll that would result if we changed the systems we know will keep us fed, only for the new idea to fall short. Unfortunately this is a problem that is likely to remain with us for a long time. Looking to nature for ideas is great, but the environment doesn't produce the amount of food we need naturally. The real issue is that Humanity seems to have grown beyond nature's capacity.
Hi, I am a farmer and I just wanted to say that farmers are working on this. There are some farmers that are not changing but many, especially young farmers, are coming up with ways to solve many of these problems. I do not think perennial crops for grain production is the answer. I do believe cover crops and inter seeded cover crop in between annual cash crops like corn and sunflowers are the future. Thanks for the interest in this. I suggest watching any of Gabe Brown's videos on his system if you are interested in what is currently being done.  Thanks
As a farmer (of course I watch YouTube while on my self driving tractor), I can confirm this is an accurate video. \nLots of people working on applying new and old solutions to some huge problems. \nI'm making improvements as fast as I can justify the expense of crop failure when trying new things.
Farming is as broken as Donald Trump's mind
Never take more than you can give back.
But growing use-plants alongside other plants makes these others weed, which are bad for when it's harvested and needs to be sorted through.
The world won't be here in 10000 years dumb bitch.
It's an idea they got from Africa. Not to say that Africans were completely aware of it either, but I think it should be noted.
I propose a more wide spread use of birth control and condoms for starters.
We need to focus on the monopoly-like hold some tractor suppliers use on farmers. Companies like John Deere will not let their farmers tinker or work on their own tractors using a product or sensor that forces it to shutdown if such a thing is detected. They can only have repairs done by the company. Some farmers have contacted hacked to break through these barriers. Farmers can't use the products they buy and own fully..it's disgusting.
So... every farmer needs to buy 5 times as much land and spend 10 times the amount of time to harvest the same amount of crops.. \nDoesn't seem like something farmers would just do. Actually, it sounds like horrible business.
The plague 2.0 will wash us out an then we will start again...
Nature is starting to feel the repercussions of mankind's free will.
Little correction:\nThe Neolithic Revolution was about 10000 B.C, not 10000 years ago. \nI know, thats not really important, but it triggered me^^
minecraft already knew this
Farming is STILL in early access, ugh!
Permaculture. Problem fixed.
go ahead, MinuteBollocks, recycle your resources - EAT SHIT!\n*eating this shit video doesnt count.
Orrrrrrr, investigate space and find a planet with good soil and living environment :D
One major issue is that grains are not exactly efficient for space or resources. For example, potatoes are probably more efficient.  Wheat actually does have an advantage:hay. Hay can feed livestock(which are inefficient anyways)or make insulation.
Actually we came up with a plan to farm when God told Adam he had too.
This is comical. They assume that thousands of years from now we will still be growing food in dirt.\nThe daily food energy requirements of a human is less than that in a cup of gasoline, or less than 3kwh - $0.30. We will eventually synthesize our food for a small fraction of the present cost with no need for land or fertilizers.
Back to nature, food forest picnic, rewilding with extra goods.
Dumb Title: It should be, LIBERAL FARMING\nand with that comes many falsehoods....
Many places here in Germany also have the problem of monocultures. Near my uncle's place in Brandenburg there is almost only Corn, Year after Year, aft Year. It's because they have many Bio Gas plants, so they use Corn to make Biomass.\nMy dad is a farmer and said that you have to change the type of crop on the field every one to three years.
or we just dump our human flesh bodies and put ourbrains in a robot and we are robots. its easy! :D
If you made all this possible, WE, ALL FARMERS, WE, THE PEOPLE, for our children, for us, for our grandparents, then the Interstellar plot will not be possible. Ever.
But how do you harvest a polyculture on a massive scale?
Everyone should have an own garden with permaculture. It would solve many problems.
And you think GMO empire-companies will just hand you this freedom of not using their seeds each and every year? Seeds resistant to their pesticides? Seeds that yield ginormus amounts of food for us to throw in the landfill after we ate our full?  \nI say nope...
Aeroponic + Solar Panels = Earth is my city!
by the time the depletion of resources like phosporous becomes a problem, we will have nuclear fusion to produce the becessary elements to replenish. Likewise, we'll be able to produce soil mimicking the natural soil etc.
Sounds like less food for the more people to come, maybe a different technique and have buildings with ecosystems that have a couple floors to harvest twice as much with the same idea you have with the same perimeter of land today. Maybe have water work with gravity showering the top floors so less water waste as well (plants that need less water the closer to the lowest floor you go).
This video fails to address the single issue preventing this model from working : money.  Factory farms have investors (think pension funds, not just individuals) who want a high rate of return on their investment. They will not accept a lower dividend just because we want them to ( and if they did you would not get to retire). The also aggressively inovate to outcompete the competition (small farms). The low wages of many households force the majority of the population to purchase the factory farmed goods. Unless you are advocating a return to slavery, i don't see how this could work. Consumers cannot afford a price hike, and increased manpower requirements for this type of farming will result in farm workers getting paid even less than they do now...
Go Vegan :-)
MOAR GENE EDITING
less babies = less mouths to feed = less agricultural degradation/deterioration
Have tried turning farming off and on again ?
Human population numbers should decline.
farming is OP?
MAKE FARMING GREAT AGAIN
VEGANS!!!! Eating all the plants.
fifteen thousand years ago
Moist
Globalist bullshit get off my trending Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Idea,kill the weak and dumb,if you are  the weak or dumb, get killed and your bodily nutrients get recycled for the farm that the strong control.over time there will be two kinds of humans that are not allowed to mix,the strong build cities and farm,the smart control goverment and money,the strong and smart are the top people that do complex working tasks such as build rockets for the colonies to other planets.the strong will be able to vote and be paid the same as the smart,they will just have the labor intensive jobs.this is my ideal goverment and world.
This is the first comment I've made on youtube. I thought more of the videos coming from this channel but i have to say, this is pure ideological conjecture. I work with the public in a town heavily saturated with agriculture and farmers, and I take offense to the broad strokes being painted here. I have learned enough with my own eyes and my love for the history of agriculture to easily argue just about every point made here.
@ 0:55 - “Gene editing”\n*Another Monsanto GMO propaganda video.*
Partially cofunded by Monsanto!
I love this Sanneeeeee!!!!
Aw I love this video. It captures that warm, fuzzy feeling you get when you pick up a new book or finish a great one. Fantastic work, Sanne!
:) this reminds me of old youtube.
THIS WAS SO GOOD!!! I'm in awe
I love this sooo much 💜
Where are the pillows around the 1 min mark from ? Love the print!
can i have the books that make me look impressive tho
You are beautiful, this is beautiful.
This was so beautiful ❤
I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess you really haven't read Tess of the D'Urbervilles because there is nothing to smile about in that book! Bleakest story ever.
That was like a love note to all books 😍☺️
Aww this is so cute 💕 absolutely love it!
So true! love this :)
Yes!!! I love this! Warmed my heart <3
This is such a wonderful video! Love the atmosphere ❤️
This is so great Sanne 💖
This is a beautiful video !
Sanne, this is soo beautiful! \nI can relate so much lol, although I don’t like giving up on books, they just wander back onto my to-read pile, in the hopes that I’ll eventually come back to them. Especially uni books. I doubt I ever will though. There’s way too many wonderful stories out there that are just waiting for me. :)
This puts me in the right mood for a reading weekend!
this is so beautiful :)
Wow Sanne that video is so great, I'm in love 😍😍
i LOVE this idea
Glad it wasn't just me who didn't read books that were part of a school/college/university course, I was supposed to read Great Expectations for my English Language and Literature A-Level, I never did, I didn't like it, not helped by the fact that it was a crumbling old copy last borrowed from school in 1974 (I started my A-Levels in 1999).
This is amazing. I love this so much! ❤️❤️❤️ I couldn’t agree more for this.
I absolutely loved this, well done!
This is so beautiful❤️
This is a very cute video, and something I can relate to as well. I loved the stop motion animation. Very nice job!
This so beautiful video!
Beautiful. But I got kind of freaked out by the book count. So many books, only one lifetime 😯
Beautifully made and very touching 💝
What a beautiful video!
This is so beautiful!
Such a beautiful video! I’m obsessed with the doodles 😍
Okay, this goes to one of my favourite youtube videos ever. LOVED IT.
I love the way you edited this video!!
This is so beautifully made. Thank you 😊 \nMay I ask what music you used in the background?
Such a wonderful video!
this is so lovely! 💛
Amazing video!!!! It's very different from what you usually do, I love it!
this is so cute!
Thank you for making this. Love it!
It hurts how clod your words are towards those books. If I've ever decided to do a video like this, I'd be crying because of how sorry I am.
Love this so much <3
This is so cute! Love it!
Sanne I have CHILLS. Also I can't bear the thought of how few books I'll get to read in my lifetime, I am reading as fast as I can!!
Such a beautiful video, I'm very moved and I don't even know why!
that was beautiful! :) you should do more videos like that, i would enjoy them.
This is wonderfully made! I really enjoyed watching (might go back now and whatch it again hihi)
This is gorgeous and amazing!!!
THAT IS SIMPLY AMAZING!!!!
Omg that was so beautiful!
I love this so much! Also I'm now totally not calculating how many books I read until I'm a hundred... ;)
No worries. There will be books in heaven. An eternal library in the sky . . . 📚💫☁️
omg this is such a cute video. I totally related to trying to read certain classics just to be able to say i've read them, but I enjoy other books a lot more.
Sanne, you were the first person I subscribed to on Youtube...all the way back in 2011! This video completely warmed my heart... Amazing job! :)
WHAT THE FUCK I JUST CRIED\nTHIS IS MORE BEAUTIFUL AND EMOTIONAL THAN HOLLYWOOD MOVIES THANK YOU
I absolutely adore this video, it's perfect <3
This made me emotional and idk why? Like I feel like I could cry. That was beautiful
haha to all my school books....
I had a tear???? This was beautifullllllll! 💝

This is fantastic!
This was lovely!
Wow this was amazing!
So cute!!!!
Love this!
fuck the literary canon created by old, white, straight men. i'd rather be at a party discussing some queer poc authors or something than a book by obe everyone pretends to have read because some senile people think we have to.
50 cent is a great interview....anybody that can have a decent conversation with Ebo won...and since when do the program director not control the play of music🤔 Ebro trash
I give props to ebro and 50 duked it out in conversation
Jay album golf course music
But this guy talks about robbing drug usage drug dealing killing etc but he can say trump is a bad guy we need to wake up as a society in understand how brainwashed we are
can someone tell me when he starts talking about mcgregor/mayweather i am not interested in anything else this guy has to say.
If you disliked this you a cunt!
I'm fuck them up hhahahahhaha
Ole ebro keep 50 ass on course let's  say that
50 Cent is the man. He gives the best interviews no matter what.
50 Cent always been hating on Jay Z and Diddy and always sounding like a Fox News reporter trying to explain himself.
Hot 97 is garbage and I'm only here for 50.
Don't really care to watch this whole thing, but I will gleam the comments to get a summary ;)
So because the business people felt it was messy in NY yall refuse to play the other artist music in NY who had hot songs & was not involving in the 50/ja rule mess. So u went to so call break outter state records that was already hot 🔥 in 47 to 30 states. AND blame 50cent. Your the program director you know who's hot in the streets of new york. You could have push state property bleek fab etc... Insteed of fat joe lox & ja rule.
“ There really art students that took on the theme thuggin “. Love watching interviews of 50.
Trump switched it up on people, people never knew he was That guy until he got in office. I on the other hand always suspected it.
Rosenberg is such a dick rider....... tell him how you really feel about 50 central and how you said he has no talent
I bumped the massacre so many winters... its very under rated
See what he had to say about 50 and if Hip Hop is done with him? Listen to An Honest Conversation About Hip Hop Episode 10 by An Honest Conversation About Hip Hop Podcast #np on #SoundCloud\nhttps://soundcloud.com/ahcahhpodcast/an-honest-conversation-about-hip-hop-episode-10
I'm tired of this osama bin laden looking motherfucker Ebro using the word nigga. \n\nNigga you ain't black, don't try fit in where you don't belong...... \n\nbitch ass nigga
50 is one of the smartest niggas out in the industry .. Don't judge a book by its cover. No one can touch this man
This guy knows how to entertain in interviews cause he will tell it like it is and give details in every situation he talks about
50 Cent finally has Beats Headphones on 😂 I know he had no choice since its what they provided for him to use on that Radio Show
Fuck flex..Come to Hot 97 they let you talk
Yo! Your videos are too long to not have timestamps.
Rosenberg just displayed bad journalism. Put words in 50's mouth, [Trump] is terrible, [right]? Also, Ebro too. Kanye was at Trump Tower and in the elevator returning from a 5 min closed-doors meeting, upstairs. He wasn't just in the lobby. Though maybe I'm wrong, that's just what I saw/interpreted from the news and paper coverage of it.
End of the day, good interview.
Fif will ALWAYS be a Hip-Hop legend💯
🦀 ass nigga, let them crackers pump n up to promote the fuc shyt...
50 is pretty smart. Wish he never fell off, hoping he'll make good music again… but you can tell that he's a real asshole lol
My boy 50 cent and I saw him in person his body is really that good and his teeth is really that white!
Tales from the ouija- who got the juice
I don't fuck wit Ebro. But he speaking the truth.
50's wrong alot of people bump 4:44 I heard it playing almost everywhere
We need a G-Unit reunion GGG unit Ebro bring Cuban links and Hot 97
What is Colgate waiting on? Sponsor this man. His teeth are impeccable. lol
Fuck Ebro, Everyday Struggle is the shit, 50 is still the GOAT...fuck Wale and Vic \n#chatNiggaz unite 🙌
Monsta he pays boi betta be cool 4 he see the real monsta
50s music is utter garbage but hes a smart dude
The south completely took over after 50/ja rule beef
lol it looks like ALL Hot 97 fans hate ebro
People only want 50 cent in there show to take shot at jay-z and puff because those 2 niggas is the only niggas on 50 mind
Eboro and Hot 97 ruined the New York sean
I been saying the same thing about trump. I really think he was trying to rebuild his brand and he ended up winning. Now he's trying anything to get impeached that wouldn't put him in prison.
There is something  always so inspiring about 50!
50 Cent and Master P interviews nothing but motivation
50 is the undisputed king of spin!
Ebro and 50 need a show together. They back and fourths be funny.
Fifty is sO frickin smart that he's on a whole different  level than Ebro and his cracker club. 😄😄😄😄
50 will always be the realest 🙏🏼
Trump never changed tho... he was an asshole from the rip... if nothing else about him you can say he didnt switch up
The old 50 almost came out after the 8:00. HAHA.........50
50cent always claps himself..always so hilarious to watch. Enjoyed every moment
I see what 50 is saying with the Hov album! However, I just don't agree with what he saying. Fifty saying basically that Jay need a club song that the young people can listen to. That he need a record that the kids can relate to. I say if the young kids don't get what Jay was saying on the 4:44 album then oh well. Jay can make any type of record now because of the work he has put in. One of his best album to date if you ask me
50 dropped serious knowledge on the rap game entertainment business and Ebro/Rosenberg tried to shit on it
Why do they say Trump is a terrible guy ?
I think if Hov and Puff pulled their dicks out 50 would think about sucking it he loves them niggas
i think Fif likes Ebro coz hes the only one of these radio guys that aint afraid of him
50 wearin the same shit he just bunched two interviews back to back what a boss
50 do big business gotta luv the strategy!!!! He said he wanted to do film now top show in the land!!! Melaninated  business moves!!
Fif is ALMOST as good a troll as Trump. Lol Fif definitely is a lot funnier.
This is the first time i see 50 cent crying. RIP Prodigy
50 cent the drug dealer from queens turn down 500,000$ for a walk through from trump..... That's Morals
fuck 50 for this interview
50 cent starts a sentence and stops to in the middle and changes route just to fuck with your head. He never says things direct, has to make one simple line complicated as fuck. Funny dude.
THIS is why 50 doesn't DO or should not RELEASE new music. He's out of touch on making music today, shit even then. Music was always a HUSTLE to him. Never appreciated music as a ART.
50 said truth Ebro  had a major play at the time in destroying NY hip hop . . Big time he turned to playing  pop artist instead  of NY  hip hop  or quality  rap and hot 97 to this day , they rather play the  pop not the quality  emcees or singers and Ebro  did screw it up .. he deserves  that L

Salute 2 ebro for acknowledging stack bundles, squuuuuad up!
Welp!  So I was driving with friend, but I accidentally grab his leg instead of gearstick. We both laughed and I unzip his pants. Then I parked the car while I fondle his balls. He is laughing because he knows it's just a joke. Then I started sucking his dick in this empty parking lot. Almost choke on it because I'm laughing so hard. He is also laughing his ass off. He starts yelling BROJOB BROJOB CHOO CHOO He cums and I swallow it all like some stupid f*ggot. I kiss him and call him a f*ggot while laughing.  I love playing pranks on my friends. Ha
50 loves Trump. The host of this is a jackass and probably thinks Trump is racist. Amazing how 40yrs in the face of the public and he wasn't a racist until he ran for President. LOL \n\nDont get your political leanings from these tools.
hip hop is youth culture...he right,but that's some bullshit that's got to change!...every other genre can have mature themes and records with something to say and artists that do what people do...and grow up...but we gotta stay immature and stupid??...why?

You should do soccer trick shots with the F2
I'm not trying to be a hater, but the goalie goal has mostly nothing to do with soccer. All that lets you tell it is a soccer trick shot is that the ball is a soccer ball and the equipment is also for soccer. Other than that, the basketball hoops are in basketball, and throwing a ball into a hoop is called basketball.

The white supremacist have always used religion to control black people and we've allowed it to happen since slavery. Always forgiving these white supremacist race soldiers for killing innocent unarmed black people.
Love DL he always says whats on his mind
Black people are not afraid of Gay people, in fact a great deal of black people actually have Gay family members. Black people are the single most accepting people on the planet which is why we are so easily infiltrated. About the only person afraid of a Gay individual is that person whom is not quite certain of their own sexuality.
hell is a mythology about Earth, so u might as well let that fear go, G and hit the books. Salute to the OG DL tho on God/Allah/Buddha and Big Mama.
DL? More like Double D L! Look at those fucked up titties of his!
D.L. is correct look at side effects of soybean food, vaccines, dental mercury amalgam and black preacher etc it's crazy man very crazy the world we live in
I didn't know this brother was so deep
dl..if it's supposed to be a girl, but she's just a guy Cross dressing!? then he rapes your daughter? his point is correct. but that's not OUR, people against it, point..
In slavery the church was the only place you could come together and have some relief , it was like the only social gathering available almost like a concert  , you was not allowed in night clubs , theatres and etc. Thats why it became a big deal with the culture .
I KNOW God exists. But that's not for me to prove. Either your spirit knows or you're just lost in the human experience. Such is life, literally. But if you fear going to hell that's not true belief anyway. May as well be athiest.
And DL just LOVES Church.

Psalm 14:1 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good... The fool (one who is morally perverse, not mentally deficient) is described as to his belief (no God) and behavior (none... good). His is a practical rather than a theoretical atheism. vv.2-7. Psalm 10:4; Psalm 53:1; Genesis 6:11-13; Romans 3:10. Be Bless.
forgiving? \nRuthless. \nWhy does every black person think slavery was like all the slave movies? \nDo people know what a drama is . If slave movies showed the vast reality of it you would be bored off your ass. Plantations were often to mostly remote , rural and life was tedious and mundane. Africans Americans know nothing about the actual brutality of slavery . The real brutality was over in Africa where Muslims (whether black , Arab or Amizigh) castrated slaves. Why does everything that rape was so common and prevelant. That's just an assumption from watching slave dramas. \nWhy do American blax show almost no interest in learning about the real past? Because deep down they don't want to know their real involvement.
Black gay men go to church because that's what black women do.  They take their cues from black female behavior.  They mimic them completely.  Church attendance in the black community is cultural and traditional.  It's not about God or being a good Christian.  It's about following that cultural imperative, because your mama and grandma forced you to go and they called out Jesus name in vain all the time.  The black church is a cesspool of sin.  There is no God there.
There's plenty of evidence: go to evidenceunseen.com and actually investigate and read a book vlad.  You can tell your not studied our country is becoming post modern not atheist anymore.  If you are an atheist you have no objective standard of morality, you have no objective purpose, there is no point of even living if there is nothing after this because you can't take it with you.  You have the burden of proof.
I don't Agree with this Fool at all but He's Dead On...Churches be Gay asf 💯😂
I'm a black atheist. And I'm not so forgiving like those Dylan Roof victims. Would never worship a God or a religion that was forced upon black people by their oppressors. Will never understand why black people pray & worship the same God as their oppressors.
Man, i LOVE this hat DL. Very stylish sir. Man, it's banging!!!!!!!
You wanna solve the bathroom issue....write dick on one door and vagina on the other...boom
This guy acts woke but he really isnt. He is also indoctrinated by white society. IMO.
The last minute of the video, he's right. Like no you want people to know. That example goes along with so many other things
It was given to us by the white man to keep us down! They hid the truth and our history from us please READ and RESEARCH
A Slave and a Slave Master CAN NOT pray to the same God!!!
Boozie saying their trying to make ppl gay but he said when he was locked up he seen 2 niqqers fucking each other... So I guess black dudes don't need no help?!
He said it doesn't make sense lol
Boosie said evil coming at the kids with gay agenda through cartoons D L refutes it and then turns around to strengthen it with his bathroom logic saying they're trying to push something on us we don't agree with by unnecessarily bringing it up, whether cartoons parades bathroom disputes or coming out the closest it's to desensitize and normalize abnormalities
I like D.L., but I think there is something to what Boosie said.  I've seen things and been a victim of things that give me an understanding of how people can try to intrude on the most personal and basic attributes of human existence.  And the big orgs that he's talking about are made up of people.  As a writer, I often write about character's private lives and a few of those characters in every would I have created have been homosexual.  I'm not trying to change the sexuality of others, I'm just creating worlds that look like the world I've experienced.  But others aren't like me.  If they can use storytelling power to rule over others, they will.
I used to believe in God.. until my grandmother, a woman who has served the Lord for the majority of her life, spent most of her time serving the church, has always paid her ties....ends up with Alzheimer dementia...God is allowing her to lose her mind, despite her faithfulness. My family seems to believe that she can just speak the disease away by quoting scriptures, esp my aunt who is in denial... and it really enrages me. IDK what to believe... im leaning/moving more towards Deism to be honest.\n\nMy aunt is in denial, willfully ignorant about my grandmother's condition... and as a result, she is doing things that she is not supposed to do when dealing with an elderly person that has this condition, she doesn't understand that my grandmothers mind rubberbands and that the disease causes habits that are innate ... so it is pointless to attempt to constantly correct or remind my grandmother.. I got so angry at her a couple weeks ago about a situation between both of them that  i wanted to lay hands on her.... but that would be unacceptable.
Davey & Goliath was a Lutheran show. Shame on you D.L.
Never mistake the Christian church for being connected with the bible,its not!!!\nThey hold the bible in their hand but blaspeme and don't follow it or teach it at all!!!!
2:00-06 he just said the shit Vlad
I believe in the higher power but not da bullshit
DL so you just gonna let a atheist shame your people bcz they practice the virtue of forgiveness . Shame on you DL for not knowing the value of human value of true love . Forgiveness is not a sign of weakness it’s a gift that brings abundance of great energy . It takes a real man / Women to forgive . Let’s not forget that .
Also I said to my friend the other day it's really no longer a man's world it's a women and children's World hence there's more gays in the world which I have no problem with it but it's true there's more homosexuals in the world today than there ever has been a lot of people like to blame it on the men not being in the home but again these men are being raised mostly by women
DL looks like a state trooper with that hat on
Majority of these churches are full of undercover devils. Those preachers will preach the word but will do the exact opposite. The ones preaching sanctimoniously be the ones with the most dirt like that dude on the Spike Lee movie Red Hook Summer.
What is the deal with the black community always finding this shit to discuss? Somebody always being suspect or looking a certain way, its not gonna matter whos gay or straight, its not gonna stop nobody's money flow or how this economy is ran, why is this the only community that has such a stigma with this? Ya'll don't like talking about it then turn around and bash your very own brothers and sisters of color that are. This is why blacks will never be able to come together as one
No forgiveness this side... i give as good as i get
I don't believe that the they if they exist would be putting the gay agenda forth for monetary gains I think they would be putting the gay agenda forth to try and control the population.
Vlad don't know SHIT
Please...don't....mention Jesus's name....you're an athiest right? And dont mock Christianity...as for what I said about you choking or gasping for air....believe me...you would no longer be an atheist...NOW....dont bother responding moron.
This Russian bitch stop dropping parts and just drop entire video
So a suicide bomber is spiritually fine? A pedophilic priest is spiritually fine? Black people spend $14 mil a week at church, but hardly support each other or invest in our community infrastructure. That $14 mil would be a great start towards being financially fine as you put it. My comment came as harsh, but I truly don't care about or hate any religion, I just see it as a hindrance for progress and a waste of my time.
I'm bout to start going to church again, find me a black woman.
D.L. actually has a point, cause the black Church well not Church, but the crazy lunatics inside the Church hates LGBT ppl, but they're always the ones whose LGBT, but on the DL...what D.L. said about the Boosie thing is what I've been saying for the longest is that nothing can turn you gay or make you gay, cause you're gay if you find the same gender attractive, so how can seeing gay ppl on TV automatically make you attracted to the same gender? that means you already had thoughts like that, but scared to express it and also when you're uncomfortable with LGBT ppl then you turn to children trying to use that as bait and blame blame blame...on the restroom thing I just think that women whether cis or trans should be in the woman's restroom period, cause what if you put Jazz Jennings a 16 year old in the men's restroom? what about her safety? cause there's numbers of assaults done to trans women and not one evidence showing that trans women use the restroom for nefarious purpose, but ppl are uncomfortable, so they bait you talking about what about the children? well guess what dummies, a predator doesn't need a law to stop them from hurting kids you morons.
I'm tatted up, but his tattoos doesn't fit him
He sounds stupid as hell.  I see why I don't even entertain his shows.  Go do something with your life becasue your wisdom and been a comedian is not working for you.  How his men in the church are gay.  You may have 1 out of 100 but you saying it as if all men in church is gay.  My choir director is not gay.
Correction Mr Hughley. You need Jesus, Comic View. As a 'Joy' man, a homospiritual, gayness is a sexually oriented counterfeit of my spiritual relationship with an invisible man called Jesus. He makes my joy complete. Ever since I started listening to Jesus every other dude started looking like a ladyboy. You too, Jamar. Just ask Yeezus. My wife would prefer it if I slept in the bed with Jesus inside me. I don't expect anyone to understand what it is to be 'joy'. Joy rights have been replaced gay rights, the spiritual with sex. I'm staying in love with my man Jesus, Jamaicans know this is right. I'm just in love with the perfect man. It saves me watching anybody else, whooo! Joy pride...looks like a fool on a cross until you wake up into reality.
What is up with all those tattoos on his neck...SMH\nDude is over 50 with all that mess on him.
If u dont believe in God then Who created the earth ur standing on? Who created Adam and Eve? How would u know that a woman was made for a man? How would u know that homosexuality is wrong? Plz dont say science . Majority of these so called christians u see today are fake christians so people give up on faith becuz of how christianity is being portrayed. Anybody can go to church and claim they're a Christian, but are they truly living the Word of God? If I go to a church and all I see is homosexual ppl in the pulpit and the pastor isnt preaching the word of God or is teaching prosperity, i know thats wrong becuz thats NOT christianity. Im not gonna jst say well God isnt real and give up on my faith based off other peoples sinful acts. That should have nothing to do with ur walk with God. All u can do is pray for them.
D.L is not lying about that.  All jokes aside 💯💯💯💯
Vlad : Kaityln Jenner was ESPN's woman of the year!\nDL : Yeah & she wasn't a woman for a month!
Bra DL old ass TATTED THE FUCK UP THO !!! I nigga got mo hits then lil wayne

TOXIC COMMENT SECTION BELOW: GRAB SOME POCORN AND SOME ORANGE MILK SIT BACK AND ENJOY THE SHOW!
African spirituality is full of forgiving people also before, and after Christian influence.
A  black man on his knees in a church with a white jesus image in his mind you got to be GAY. Along with that type of posture and that image NO way you can be a positive image other young black men absolutely 👎 NO way.
That have to conflict your mind a lot on top of all the other issues that they face
Jesus tells u to forgive. He says if someone slaps u, offer them the other cheek to slap. But people only want to follow Jesus to an extent. We, and il throw myself in this mix, dont want to follow Jesus when it gets tough. Only when it benefits us. And that os not what Jesus wants us to do.
Gay cartoons are inappropriate for children
He was speaking truth about the bathroom issue, if they didnt make a big scene about it nobody would know but they want you to know they in there with the wrong parts and then want you to accept it.
I'll never forget the time I went to this baptist church (mostly black) and this man in the choir was dressed up like a woman. I was 13 at the time. I'm 36 now.....I'm talking bout make-up nails and all. The bullshit is real.
Belief of possibly going to hell in what makes me believe in God.
That's 100% TRUTH!! Look at Bishop Eddie Long Stroke, may he rest in 💩!!
Now He Tripping
Eddie Long?
The black church is definitely beyond suspect of gay shit
We should not be so forgiving
Black atheist here! ✋🏿

greatttttttttttt question VLAD..
Homos flock to church
Wtf Was THE Message Damn
That hat gotta go
Vlad Dracul a.k.a. Dracula
I think black people process non-belief differently. Generally, whites become Atheists and want to tell the entire world. Many of them come off as having a real ax to grind with religion. Plenty of black people have turned away from religion. We just don't feel the need to broadcast it like that.
Black and atheist AF
Been A Black Athiest since Birth!'
Shit i know a few black atheists...they believe there's no God but everything is just part of the universe
Black Atheist here. Christianity is a cancer to modern society and made to keep the minds of black people enslaved.
*Church is THE gayest place on earth.  I feel sorry for the gays @times.  Imagine me attending a KKKlan rally/backwoods meeting only to hear they don't like my kind for hours on end?  This is how gay folk look in church when Rev. Do-Wrong speaks of them going to hell on a bobsled for being gay.  Then he signals the gay choir director to cue the music.* sad.
Just read Deuteronomy 28 the whole chapter an Deuteronomy 7, an Psalms 83. It will tell you who the true hebrew an jews are. An why black people go through so much
Forgive lol why?
Black and atheist as ever, however I stay gucci down to the socks
What's up with dude vlad a black people. He need to talk to some real niggas
DL is wrong, sinners go to church to find Jesus and hear about him, even sinners like homosexuals went to church and repented of same gender immoral sexual practices and now embraced the joys of the opposite gender. Jesus loves the sinners but hates the sin they do.
I'm black and atheist and proud!
I'm black and an atheist
Hell no!  Black people shouldn't forgive white bigots and racists.
If you go to church, you're gay
He's got a point
Atheism >>>>>
I'm an atheist 🤙🏾😄
Vladimir Putin SHUT THE FUCK UP FUCK UP... ps MR HUGHLY SHUT THE FUCK UP.. AFTER U TELL A LIL TRUTH......\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStupid mf
That Dylan Roof shit was fake.  That family's apology was fake. Probably wasn't even the family.
WE ARE THE REAL JEWS THE ISREALITES
I'M A BLACK CHRISTIAN.
BlAck people are snakes, Africans are more loyal

안녕하세요, 저는 아르헨티나 출신이며이 버전을 원 버전보다 더 좋아한다고 말하고 싶습니다.
그들이 얼마나 시원한 지. 나는 아르헨티나이고 나는 구글 번역을 사용했다.
Vengo de Corea y mas :V
Te falta pronunciar bien algunas palabras en Español. 💪
mmm I was drawn by the title. Thought it'd be a fashion video but it is more about makeup. Anyhow your outfit is cute!
Looks too much like an add
If you were on a TV commercial literally doing the same video I doubt anyone would hate on it. Honestly what's the difference between that and this? Silly folks. Cool video, loved the outfits. Tried to recreate the grungy eye...total YouTube fail for me, (I'm a Pinterest fail professional) but I'll keep trying. :) Cheers from Detroit.
What didn't you put an AD disclaimer in the title? You're required to do that.
Your legs look amazing in those boots!! Xx
You look happier lily, hope you are well!
You forgot to use the green on your waterline while doing the second eye 🙈 loved the look anyway 😊
Loved the eye look 🌹 Your outfit was great too 👌
Thanks for a great beauty vlog Lily - so many bloggers have moved to fashion and forgotten the importance of beauty tutorials and reviews x
Outfit on point !
Your hair looks amazing at the moment, would love to know if you have changed your routine/products. 😍
Love everything about this look! And I also always forget how much I love wearing green eyeliner. Can't wait to pick one up again.
Wth! You look like Rebecca from Eastenders but with a different voice
That skirt is gorgeous 😍
Love this look!
Great video!
I really loved this video! It would be so interesting for curly and frizzy hair girls like me to see a hair routine of yours...what products you use, how you straighten your hair, how you manage it, etc. That would be just brilliant.
love this whole look!!! your hair always looks amaze & I want to try that mascara!!!
I love how we could tell you are actually excited about everything you showed in this video, you were smiling so much specially in the outfit part :) btw your nails are so cool!
Love the outfit! I've been looking to get a similar skirt!
great video, Lily...love the fall styles! Can you start posting dupes to all of your purchases though? Not all of us can afford $400+ skirts and blouses.... :(
Such a wonderful video!  Love the makeup, outfit and hair :):)
You look stunning 💕 love you with this hair length, perhaps even more so with it even longer! 💇🏻
Wish there was a far away view of the whole outfit!
Lily I just love your base, it's flawless....how did you do it? You've probably spoken about it a lot of times but I just watch all your vids and Except for the NY get ready with Anna I haven't seen a make up tutorial in a while! so I was wondering if you can tell us what you've used (foundation, concealer....) you looked gorgeous btw, I love the grungy look 😊
I love everything about this.  I totally forgot all about green eyeliner, it's the only eyeliner I actually feel good in as black can be a bit harsh on me.  Your hair is so lovely, I really wish I could pull off the middle parting as good as you do, and the outfit is very different for you.  I feel like we have a similiar sense of style so I am going to have to check out that mint jumper.  Really great video Lily,  really enjoyed watching. Hope you are keeping well :)
I really enjoyed this video!! The make up look was a bit different but without being too wacky and anyone could wear it x
I loved the outfit! the mascara looks great too. xx
I saw Lily Pebbles wearing green liner and gold shadow, so I bought green liner and gold shadow (and army pants and flip flops).
You're twisting it towards your face 🙈😂
I loved your make up and the skirt! I'm not sure about the jumper though! I really liked its colour, but I think a more fitted jumper would look better!
I love the outfit Lily. Also, you've inspired me to try to do a version of this eye look. Thanks!
I loved the outfit! Definitely recreating 😍😍
Loved the eye look!
which color is your nailpolish???
I looooved the outfit! Especially the boots. So chic and a little sexy 👌🏼
I think You look Amazing in that look😍👌🏼💖💖💖👋🏼
Great video Lily! I loved the makeup+hair+outfit combo. Just missed an outdoors shot of you modeling the outfit, I think that would have tied up the video nicely.
loving the autumn look Lily x
That brown eyeshadow work perfectly with your roots! This is perfect!
You look amazing in the autumnal colours....and you have great legs. Loving the green eyeliner, too x
Amazing outfit and I really love your hair colour right now 🙌🏻💕
LOVE that jumper!!!
i loooved the outfit!
Love this look Lily ! It looks great on you
Wow, I love this look and the make up is 👌🏻 I read alotttt of YouTube comments and I swear people are TOUGH on you. I loved this video and whatever if it's an ad. It didn't feel like product placement...plus it's your job. Keep producing great, approachable looks. Your videos have been stellar lately 👍🏻
The smoked out green feline flick was such a nice idea 😍
Outfit is the bomb! A little  bit sexy at the same time.I love it.xxx
love the outfit very much!!! love from Belgium
Your hair is so beautiful 😍 love the outfit
Loved this video Lily! Definitely think I'll be trying green eyeliner now x
This outfit is amazing! I love how unique the colours and materials were and how it doesn't look like every other autumn outfit on social media. Can't wait to try that eye look too! Amazing video xx
Love the outfit, you look fab!
As you started to put on green eyeliner I was worried it won't look good, but girl, it looks amazing!
I love the outfit! You've really become one of the people I look to for style inspiration :)
Such a lovely video ❤ and Lily you ROCK this look👌
I Ike how you added the green! Such a nice touch and your autumn outfit look was so cute!:)
Love this look!!!
You look beautiful!!!!
Love the green eyeliner, it really is so beautiful on brown eyes! Ah I almost forgot about the Matte Balms, I used to be so obsessed with them!
You are awesome 😍. Lots of love from Mexico 🇲🇽❤️
Really loving your hair Lily, it looks great. Also that skirt 😍
Love this outfit, you look really pretty on skirts and dresses. \n\nLove your videos! ❤
I loved this lily!! such a great video idea and love your style so much! :) also: I hope you are feeling a bit better! <3
I actually loved the makeup look, it suited you so well! Will definitely try on myself even though where I live it's spring time now.
I looove this makeup look on you. The green liner looks amazing.
Liked the makeup but only three mins of the video is about style? Maybe change the title x
Love love love this on you❤️
I loved this video! :) the outfit looks so nice on you..very flattering :) Can't wait for the autumn weather to get here ...\nI really enjoy your videos more and more lately ... especially your vlogs 😊💕
from watching this i've decided that I need that eye look in my life, also your hair looks SOOO nice!! just loved this video!!
You look beautiful! Wear more skirts and boots! Very nice Lily!!
The outfit is aces!! I’m inspired by it x
Omg this outfit is amazing!!! Definitely feel inspired!!!! 😍😍 the eye look is gorgeous as well - nice to see an autumnal look that isn't red and orange 💕
Great video Lily, love the way you did your makeup, hair and styling. The whole video was put together amazing 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼😀
Really need to get my hands on a green liner, there’s a sentence I never thought I’d say. Well write anyway lol. Loving your whole outfit Lily x
i really like the green eyeliner, you look very sexy!
Really liked the outfit on you!!
Love all of this! I'm going to try that mascara, I love a tubing mascara.
I LOVE this outfit! That skirt is so cute, my friend was wearing a very similar one today and she looked stunning
love the boots and your make up is perfect Lily!
ooooh I LOOOVE the outfit it's different for you but so nice! Love it love it love it
Hi Lily, loved the format of this video and your outfit though different for you still reflected your own personal style. I remember watching the vlog when you were on your boot hunt last year and they look lovely on you! ❤️
You're making me want over the knee boots! I keep trying to convince myself I don't need any.
Your look is so simple but also very sophisticated. Big like for this new autumn combination in your wardrobe and in your makeup👌💗💗💗
The outfit looks bomb! Those colours are so flattering on you, love the mint/light brown combo
You look so good Lily! I love the eye look
I've been loving your videos lately, Lily. Your YouTube style is really evolving. X
Just wanna see you do a contoured highlight full American insta girl glam makeover video would be fun x
LOVE the look, especially the outfit! It's so simple and chic! I think you should add a simple gold necklace though to add something to the neckline :)
BEST I've ever seen you look. Beautiful!
Love the makeup, hair and the clothes 😍😍😍
Those boots!!!!  Love them!
Love this look xx
Another inspiring video! TFS!
Wow! You look fabulous!
That green liner!! love love love
Your make-up looks lovely! Xxxx
The green eyeliner looks so good on you! Love your autumn style ❤️🍂
Your hair looks amaze!
Youtube has become very unoriginal these days. Everyone looks the same and wears the same trend- or statement pieces. The Gucci belt, the Gucci Bag, the same cashmere knits...I mean, I like your video, but it won't inspire me. Sorry, I am not trying to be mean, I love youtube and watching you and others doing what you do. But its become so predictable. Autumn Makeup, GRWM, Ads, Fall Faves, WIMB ...
EA u call this a game?!?\n\n\n\n\n\nI call it a masterpiece
Font colour yellow, brackets need to be rewritten to format
Very good and nice
It looked pretty interesting until you can find them in crates ...mmkay seeya next time EA
I love John Boyega’s voice
Why is not Rex or Fives in the game😭
What u should know about Darth Vader, funny: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlYNwEWAUoU
What happened to all the game modes on the first one? They should have carried them over as well
the sound design of the shooting, explosions and hits are amazing
who tf is gonna choose rei over maul
Basically a remastered version of the original star Wars battle field 1 which instead of coming out with the newer bf1 they shoulda just came out with this
i almost died when i saw that content!!
I didn't think that i would say this, but this actually looks amazing!
So cross hero gameplay is a thing :/
I want to know if Matt the Radar Technician be added to the game at some point.
I was so happy to hear the game mode galactic assault and then they said 20vs20.\nWhere is the old version where you could split screen, choose between the empire or republic and duke it out across the universe taking planets and destroying your friends fleet in space...\nplayers of the originals will understand what I mean, although there is more content here I really hope that EA could throw this game mode back in.
Game could be good but it isn't! Same shitty system like the first one and like bf one as well! Why could EA not saty with the old battlefront? Or like bf3?
This is Star Wars Battlefront Two, where we give you features the originals had ten years ago and pretend we're being innovative
Boy the compression took a hit LMFAO
People talking about “free dlc”.... you forgot they’re adding micro transactions to make up for that money?
Ps4 footage my ass. The particles and textures are beyond ps4 can handle. I doubt this will even match final version.
Bet your tits I'm playin heros vs villains all day everyday
EA......... this looks pretty badass so far.......... SO PLEASE DON'T FUCK THIS UP AND MAKE IT A GREEDY DLC FEST LIKE THE LAST GAME.
The pay to win is strong in you young Battlefront 2...
So fucking hot I'm excited
Kylo ren...  i honestly think they screwed up the whole entire series adding him
I'm trying not to get my hopes up lol
I know I wasn’t the only one that had GOOSE bumps
I don't think enough people are talking about how Heros and Ships and stuff are not randomly places on the map now. The better you play the more youll be a hero, which is how it SHOULD be.
EA should've added Tr-8r as a hero character
Every time obi wan spawns he better be saying Hello there or this game fails
Why not galactic conquest smh that was am amazing part of the old ones, bring it back!
I was so happy watching this, then they mentioned loot boxes. Then I remembered this is EA.
Can you play the single player campaign with a friend?
This video just convinced me to pre order this game. Where are my pants? Lol 😂
There are levels of rarity in star cards - Ayy my favorite
EA, I can almost hear Bakers voice as the clones. EA, why not Morris? EA?! IS IT BAKER OR MORRIS?!!
This game shouldn't be getting hate, because they fixed everything and listened to their fans. This game looks EPIC!!! Definitely buying... when the price goes down a bit ( probably after a month or two XD ) But i definitely recommend you buy this game!!!
No matter how good this game is, some people will hate it just because it’s EA.
This made my nuts wet.
When EA wanna bump up the hype train but you don't wanna get dissapointed yet:\n\nI'm one with the force and the force is with me, I'm one with the force and the force is with me, I'm one with the force and the force is with me.....
They better of gotten rid of that bitch ass shield that completely destroyed the fun out of the first one. you'd be seconds away from killing someone and that motherfucker would activate that shield and run off into the sunset as you get killed trying to claim that kill.
Will it be on Steam?
I want to take Yoda, my favourite character
Good but until lightsaber combat gets better than what they showed us I ain't buying
new star wars mmo with these graphics <3 <3
I swear if they don't nerf the Scattergun
Political Correctness shit plus the space fights looks like the planes are all just gliding too damn slow.
There is no R2B2 engaged in assisting the battle, this isn't worth playing.
Cant wait to play this\nI hope EA makes this the battlefront game we all can enjoy and get so much satisfaction from.\n\n really have high hopes for this
instead of finn we could have anakin for the force sake
Star Wars Battlefront 2 (2005) still looks and will be vastly better. Fucking lol. 14 maps.\n\n\n\n*1 4*\n\n\n\n*L o l*\n\nInstant action?\n*No.*\nGalactic conquest?\n*No.*\nMods?\n*No.*\nSingle player campaign that's actually likeable and not cookie cutter?\n*No.*\nGood game? \n*You bet your ass not.*
Let me guess... DLC...More DLC...Mirco-Transactions... Even More Mirco-Tranactions...spending $150 for an incomplete game that requires me to purchase DLC.... I doubt this BattleFront 2 will beat the Original...
Damn, this game looks crisp. It brings new life into Star Wars
There are so many Sith and Jedi from the expanded universe you could add in the game and you edgy phase Kylo ren
Can people who bought Battle Front 1 please get a discount or some reward for buying this one?
but CAN you get IN and OUT of the vehicles? and transport friends in 2 person ships?
Love This game I played The first one Amazing.. BUT IT'S MISSING a few things that would take this game to the next level.  LIKE CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION AND It Would be nice to be able to keep your level from SWB Pt. 1 AND EVENTUALLY BE ABLE TO LEVEL UP AND BECOME A BOUNTY HUNTER, JEDI OR SITH WITH YOUR CHARACTER JUST SAYIN.
We've captured the command post! That's all I want to hear
Looks absolutely amazing!!\nIm speechless!!!!! \n(Like if u agree)!
2:29 You just cant have nice things
Finally a game where they focus on the villains and not the good guys even tho I think the dark side is way better than the light side who agrees
Nothing pisses me off in these kinds of comments sections then 10 year old's bragging about how they and all their friends pre-ordered the most expensive edition.  They are constantly disappointed by horrible games, but they never stop.
Quick question, do Banthas count as vehicles?
Wow
And singleplayer hah?

Together we fight. We have our respective battles in life. I really hope you'll have victory over your cancer and I recently took my licensure examination for Mechanical Engineering awhile ago. And I really hope I'll pass too. Thank you for inspiring me to be positive. I also started vlogging because of you. Thank you for being one of my inspiration in life. Get well soon!
These videos you upload is like an eye opener to people. Thanks to you Wil! I think people's opinion of having cancer is now changing because of you.
I think a lot of people need to watch more of your vlogs because if they don't watch or even know about it, they're missing something out. They won't be able to see how great this channel is; That there is a simple guy who give smiles and laughter in any way he can, spreading positivity especially to those (sick people) who are experiencing the same thing, sharing the love he's getting from people who loves him and letting us audience feel it (in some way), a good brother and son, has a cool & loving family and most of all an amazing person who has been an inspiration to a lot of people. \n\nWil: Why Filipino?\nPudra: Because they are good in everything.\nWil: Hehe! True, true.\n\nJust like Pudra said, Filipinos are good in everything.\n\nFor example:\nYou Wil. You have been very good in fighting this cancer, seeing a cancer patient so active and so full of life is just amusing. Keep up the good work sir and that 1M subscribers will soon appear on the home page plus that—\nCONGRATULATIONS for Surpassing ONE MILLION SUBSCRIBERS Wil Dasovich, I mean The Golden Play Button will be yours, I'm looking forward to that.\n\nP.S \nYou're mom is soooo lovely, the same as my mom. 😁😁😁
Haley was speachless cuz Coron was so beautiful...I have seen you speachless also when Alodia was by you...her kindness and compassion are apparent to us viewers too even if she may not officially be your soulmate

👑Princess Alodia Almira Latest Vlog Comments: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iAQaxok_O8\n\nEvery vlog that you uploaded makes me smile @alodiaalmira it reminds me everytime that you are still what you are as being the Princess that your Dad wants to see! the spirit of #Princess Alodia Almira 👑 is still there everytime you #Cosplay.  Well you begin to dream as a Cosplayer and at the very end you'll also and always be a Cosplayer whatever happens in the future.. You know i dreamed also to become like you @alodiaalmira if only those opportunity and those destiny that has given to me went to success? Baka kasama na kita nuon pa last 7 yrs since year 2010 but things went smoother.. Because i made a wrong turn, or wrong decision in every time line, in every opportunity that comes along the way for 7 yrs or early than that we say 14 yrs since 2003. But that was all in the past.. So enough of excuses for me. The important is i am still alive and still fighting to make my dreams come true. Well I've heard this promise over many times by different people out there Action Speaks Louder Than Words I agree it is true. If other successful people apply this #principles to fulfill their dreams and their destiny. Why not me? I have waiting to make my Technology fruitful for 27 yrs since 1990 why not try to take risk and give all my best shot this year 2017? If the phoenix of #HarryPotter power is real, then if i have that similarities of Destiny why do try? And work hard to show to everyone that i am Useful and Helpful to the people especially the #poorpeople around the World? Then why not? Guys and @AlodiaAlmira. I've realize that there's no more time to hide i think it's for me to shine~! So please don't cursed me on past comments that I've post, peoples change so i am also can change! Help me don't take me down. 👽🙏\n\nBtw. I've made a Prayer for you all~ \n\nOur Father - God Almighty is an eternally creative and active recycling entity in a realm that extends from nothingness to all things whatsoever without exception. In short he is everything there is that Man can perceive and all those beyond his imagination forever. \n\nThis being the case, It becomes our duty to discover in this seemingly chaotic environment - the realities which are beneficial to us, Our Father provides his own body and soul with all things needed for survival - being a part of him we only have to find what we need. They are there for the taking, the bees know this from the flowers; the cattle from the grasses; the apes from the fruits; the rest from the nutrients of others and the soil to which they return.\n\nEventually, our physical constituency disperse to be part of others Ad-Infinitum. The soul is an enigma, it is consciousness of one's ego held together by Spiritual Energy, Man will never understand. But our Father gave man the ability to invent through Science Engineering, Technology and Philosophy.\n\nIn the meantime, that we do not understand what a soul is, let us record our constituency and consciousness in our Computers, to be stored, preserved and reconstituted back into our own selves, at some future time at our discretion, let us create our own Heaven where we can Live For All Eternity. ✨\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/notes/g-buoy-frigillana/creating-our-own-heaven-/400811423614621/
It's the Dexamethasone (steroid)
I just wanted to say that I saw this woman on chrisbestcancer who had colon cancer and she cured her cancer by juicing carrots everyday., She juiced 5 pounds of carrots everyday and otherwise didn't change too much of her life. I think she is a famous author.,
Keep your dressing dry and intact Wil.. to prevent infection 😊😘
My Friend's chemo took effect after the 4th session. She said that the pain is too much that she can't barely move even though she is just laying down on her bed. I hope for the best Wil! I know you are a strong chonggo and you can overcome this! Praying for you dude! :)

#WilDasovich I just want to tell you that I haven't been really active in youtube other than watching videos of cooking and camera reviews, yet after I heard about the news with your medical condition, I got so inspired by you that I immediately subbed and made sure that I get notified each time you upload a video. \n\nI wanna know how you are doing and how you are staying strong fighting against cancer. You have such a great family and you have such a great heart. You're happiness and positive energy is contagious, it manifests a lot in you.\n\nBy the way, when I heard about the RAWR Awards? I made sure to look for you and told my friends about it. You deserve so much more than just an award. \n\nKeep fighting Wil! We love you. 😘

Effects of dexamethasone running in ur body its a steroid;thats why you feel hyperactive and restless,though u need to sleep well,keep proper precautions cause ur still immunocompromised

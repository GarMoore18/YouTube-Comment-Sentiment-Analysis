我大华夏~\(≧▽≦)/~
why u put 包子into the chilli sauce? I think the老板娘 just wanted u to put dumplings into the chilli sauce. Unlike Shanghai, in Sichuan，we usually just eat 包子without any sauce. However, if u like it, then eat whatever u want! lov ur videos in Sichuan, they make me homesick and I really want to go back to Chengdu and enjoy those delicious food❤️
It's amazing to see everything so fresh and colorful in even the tiniest of shops. America should take note.
Do you bring your own chopsticks to restaurants?
they put cats (catmeat) in those buns...not that i have a problem with eating cats...but some people who may be squeamish, just a heads up
Are these Sichuan videos old? Trevor's Mandarin seems to be worse than recent vids...
Hello from Trinidad & Tobago Trevor. Keep up the good work
GREAT VIDEO, I WOULD LOVE TO COME OVER AND SPEND A COUPLE OF WEEKS WITH YOU. I'M A CHEF AND LIVED IN KOREA FOR 13 MONTHS AND IT WAS GREAT. I'M WORKING IN A RAMEN NOODLE SHOP AT THE PRESENT, JUST WONDERING HAVE YOU BEEN TO SINGAPORE I HEAR IT IS THE BOMB.
How do you manage to poop? You eat chillies like everyday but I mean how does it not burn all the time? I ate fresh chilies once and it was nasty going to the toilet,felt that I almost had instant hemorrhoids!
Was those last dishes hotter than that one dish that the bowl was IN the table?
why arent you fat? why
大半夜看你吃包子。。。我好饿呀
你的中文似乎很长时间没有进步。
包子是不沾酱的啊
自贡是个很棒的地方，欢迎世界各地朋友来玩。:)
It is supposed to be zì gòng, not zì gōng. The second sound means you gonna cut off your little buddy.
how i wish you visit Yunnan a little bit earlier, it's mushroom season, locals love wild mushrooms. it's a little bit late, but try to find ji zong, niu gan jun, gan ba jun, they are local's top list.
OH ! I miss my hometown ZIgong SO MUCH.
“ OHHHHHHH “

Bhai Trevor, enough of China yaar. Why don't you show us that side of Canada (ur home) & US street tours. More than 70% of Ur vids are China.
Hi man, have you ever think about posting your video on to some China video website like Bilibili. I think many Chinese are willing to watch your videos.
Plz be here for Nepal too...we have got numerous delicious food!!! Excited to welcome you in the Land of Buddha and Everest.
Who won the 1 million subscriber giveaway? I gotta know it was me!
The camera work should receive an award for this video. It is outstanding.
Hi,Trever,I just happened to see your vedio on the weibo of Chinadaily,and started following U on youtube.:) Cannot wait to see ur new vedioes:D
Do you ever....finish your food? Seems such a waste
Why following the Pennywise look?
We have been watching you for so long, your part of our home. What a cool show.  Keep going to all those cool places so we can visit some day!
Trevor, have you made any videos where you go to a big city, like Shenzhen, and go into a nice restaurant? Not street food but in an upscale sit down restaurant.
my boy trevor getting a little thicc
your video are very short...and seldom too..not unlike before
I'm glad there is still real food somewhere and not the commercial factory produced food in the west concocted in the lab instead of a real kitchens as shown here.
well, I see a certain Trever put on some weights over the last few months ;)
in start of this video, you walking on the street, the sound of your voice is incredible, can you tell me what kind microphone do you use?
Zigong is my hometown, so sweet, love this video.
When Food is too spicy it´s not fun. Eating should be fun and joy.
Just 2 days of net problem in my home, made me miss your videos so much
It's good that you rate how spicy the dishes are, can you do that for the rest of your videos plz?
I think it's not that spicy for me. coz I can't eat without chilli
Ohh man u really did a good job, keep doing....loved ur video, chinese people n u..LOVE from INDIA
You're getting chubby :D I totally understand though, with all that delicious food available to you!

I have never seen so many chillies in one plate 🔥🔥🔥🔥 I don't know how he could have finished that let alone take more than a couple of bites 😣😣😣 I can feel the heat
i love spicy food especially Chili's but this food is going to the extreme did you end up finishing the meal👍👍👍
why don't you try and come to cambodia?
I miss the bum
#46 ON TRENDING Trevoh and his team doing their thing.
Wow first dishes I've seen where chilies are by far the main ingredient. I like chilies in almost everything but I don't think I could handles those.

Amazing! China is a place full of great things to explore with exotic foods to savour. Sichuan just makes it top notch.
Just amazing to watch you enjoy the food and the people you meet.
ooohhhhhhhh
the MSG factor is troubling
Why they put MSG in about everything?
Hello! This AiYe Chicken Feet is fake.The original named LiLin Supper(立玲夜宵).As locals of ZiGong I don't think that you've got the most famous food In ZiGong.
if he doesnt go to jail , then we will see the power of the money , if anyone of us do that , for sure we were on jail already.
Ewww. I guess he has to pay the karma debt by going to jail and get f*** by the Mexican mans
Having to watch this fugly walrus of a hairy beast take a shower must be akin to crucifixion! Disgusting jew!
the jew cries out in embarrassment as he molests you
Hollywood has always had this kinda rep, this isnt anything new.. Why do young people keep trying to knock down the doors to get into a corrupt and perverted industry??  What do you expect??
Quel gros porc.puant  Il porte la perversion sur sa sale gueule.
Stop sucking dick to get parts in Hollywood all of you ladies.
I want justice for the potted plant!
look at that, I cant blame him for trying ;)
Nothing will happen to him because he's a Jew and Jews run Hollywood
Isn't that that fabian guy from channel one?
Well, you gotta admit -- he had good taste in women.  Only the best...
YOU'RE SO DEAD IN PRISON
Who the hell would watch some old fat dude take a shower? Lol
execute harvey for his crimes
So gross. Has some fetish with being watched taking a shower and beating it. Very weird the way he begs for it. Smh.
So now it seems clear to me that any so called actress who was in his films has revealed themselves to be a PROSTITUTE No MAN would ever sleep with a fat ugly woman no matter how rich or powerful but women on the other hand......
He made all this people rich
Can he even find his penis beneath that belly?
Grab her by the pussy.
JEWISH SEX TERRORIST IS HARVEY WEINSTEIN
Liberal Hollywood is being Exposed 😈👿☻👻
I know I am going to get heat for saying this, but the fact that so many women stayed quiet rather than call out this predator is truly sad and upsetting. Their silence perpetuated his deviant behavior. In his sick mind, there wasn't anything wrong with it... Why? Because most of the women shrugged it off or were afraid of losing their career. What's more important, values and standing up for what's right or money and Fame? It seems for many the latter, smh.
Desperately pleading is NOT what Weinstein was doing, you jackasses. We can assume that headline was written by a man.
But he looks so nice and sounds so nice. (Not about the creepy bit)
A perverted freak exposed and uprooted Praise the Lord
After we had a mutually agreed rough and an extremely perverted bukake, anal, foot fetish, food fetish, hentai - like, fisting, footing or feeting, he stood up, looked at me with his devilish eyes and said: \nCan you massage my shoulders, please! \nIt was terrible, massaging that grizzly bear. That massage request was very offensive and hard for me.\n(it's a joke!)\nImprison that hungry perv!
a beautiful 22 year old italian model \nthanks for letting us know she was 'beautiful', news. because that's a really valuable and relevant piece of information to a sexual harassment case.
there's no criminal act here, I don't know this fuss is all about.
Harvey Weinstein? Hollywood?\nThis happens in every aspect of American business.\n\nThe gambling company IGT is just as corrupt and disgraceful.\nThey protect racists, deviants, con men and would defend paedo's if it made them a buck. \n\nPatti Hart, when she was the CEO of IGT, and former General Counsel Johnson, oversaw and concealed: \n1) The bribery of staff to lie to cover up management criminality \n2) The blackmailing of staff to cover up management criminality \n3) Non-disclosure of evidence in direct contravention of court orders\n4) Perverting the course of justice \n5) Forcing staff, by mandate, to commit perjury in court \n6) And other breaches of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act relating to some suspiciously odd adjudications by equally corrupt judges.
Maybe he''ll be having a shower with big bubba someday soon.
Weinstein is a sexual predator but the ALMIGHTY HOLLYWOOD protects him and their fellow sexual deviants goyim.\n\nThey thought the Satanic Cult is just a crazy Christian Conspiracy. But this is a hard evidence that several A-listers accused him now.
Don't ruin your friendship with me over five minutes... How simultaneously sad and needy, disgusting and manipulative.
No one should be surprised at what the culture of permissiveness and near naked women and power created. It is also no wonder at the more than 100,000 rapes in this country due to the bombardment of everything having to be sexy.  Virtually everything in the movie industry has an element of sex thrown in and giving something a PG-13 rating will not stop young viewers. Make the ratings and warnings much stronger. God, family and country.
Throw the book at this pervert.
THAT demanding insolent voice is THE DEMON Thats ON HIM TALKING! One demon on him -opens door for lots more. HarveyW IS TOTALLY OVERRUN WITH DEMONS. This guys lord is SATAN. AND NOW satan IS DONE WITH HIM. Devil COMES TO STEAL KILL AND DESTROY! 👎💩👎💩👎
When women singers like the one who used to be Hannah Montana sexually harrasing males none bat and eye, but when a Male do same thing, all of you start complaining about it like a bunch of little kids.
How's the power over women goin Harvey? How's it going?
Yet you all support Hollywood from Woody Allen barely legal adopted Korean daughter to Michael Jackson molesting young boys.  Corey Feldman so messed up (some kind of victim syndrome).  Even Bill Clinton molesting interns as govenor to President.  You all gawk at celebrities as role models?  Why now with McGowen?
Nasty jew.
No woman is going to have sex with that ugly mug on purpose unless she is blind!
Disgusting Hollywood kike. Deserves to be removed from this planet
If the devil had a voice, his is what it would sound like
Evil ugly pig.
I just have a question...why now ladies ? Why not when it happened ? Or is it because you liked what he was doing to you ? You all went to bed with thim stop playing victims...
Ugh
Dear God
Jewish Zionism at full effect!
Another Liberal SJW is revealed!
Not only actresses in Hollywood who experience sexual harassment, but ordinary young women around the world. Molestation of girls, Here's how you fight it. # speakout #speakup #saynotomolestation PEOPLE LIKE HIM SHOULD BE HANGED. \nLink👉👉👉👉 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI5UfM6DJWI&t=4s
Everyone shoud read this blog about Hollywood's hypocrisy with President Trump: http://www.trumpscorecard.com/gone-too-far-1.html
Put a bullet in this kike prick's head.
That's not good, of course. But come on! All these celebs would be nobody without his help. And if some of them said No to hime, they said Yes to other perverts.
I hope we can all come together as a country and kill all the people like this including trump :) Happy Murder everyone
What about the allegations of sexual harassment, seems to me not denying it means it’s TRUE
Brave girl. All those pigs should be exposed and put in prison.
They would if they could but they can't, its a c*nt.
He looks like a cancerous elbow.
Dad always told me never go into a room with a jew
He probably didn’t even need the five minutes.
If your president does it what do you expect!
A fat lecherous jew...who would ever believe it?
Who taped the conversation between he and the model?
Oh common people. He is not the only pig in the movie industry.
The year of the Weins. First Anthony w...../carlos danger/mr abedin. now HW....
I dont understand why did they wait so long to sue him and report those facts.
Hollywood seems to be full of very *strange* people , can you guess what group they belong too ? ..Here is a clue ' You can't talk about them '.
Hey can all the anti-Semitism.
That italian chick ruined her chances to become next Hollywood stupidstar...
Whats wrong with desperately pleading with a beautiful model?
Did this nice man maybe upset the wrong jews?
If its only alleged surly you shouldn’t be making a video on it?
Please dont be outraged by Harvey Weinstein if you voted for a president that wants to grab em by the pussy!
A jew protected for decades by Jewry in Hollywood \nNothing to see here
That man looks too dirty for taking shower so often....
Jews have a perverse and degenerative effect on American society
Waiting for a guy to denounce him for sexual harassment too. That would be funny.

What's wrong with you people?!\nShe's full of age, he wants sex, so what? She could have left anytime.\nJust because he's ugly yet rich doesn't make it a crime.
Our cultures popular entertainment is trash, ran by trash, who wants you to be trash.
Allegedly??? No that was him... I hate how they try to make a rapist sound like he maybe innocent....
Poor guy was just trying to get laid.
did he grab her pussy? \n(did he ask first?)
Still...not nearly disgusting as Comrade Trump, who RAPES America EVERY DAY.\n\nBOOT OUT ALL republicons, NOW!
Women sell their bodies to corporate heads to get a head start in there careers. Then when they don't get anywhere, they scream RAPE to make a buck.
my nigga 6lack looking faded as fuck. mad cover
Dayyyuummm
Neo Soul is supposed to be sultry and understated, enthusiasm doesn't necessarily have to be conveyed through being loud or charismatic. Fantastic musical sensibility.
Bunch of Haterz in the comments. I can imagine those people to be analyzing every word he singing. It's good music for the Soul and Spirit. Don't matter if you don't like it because other people will.
This is 6lack putting his touch on the song, reason why it's a cover!!! I say flamessss!!!!!!
Greatness will always be critiqued by those less qualified. Bless 6lack
Not the biggest fan of dude's music, but I really don't enjoy just watching you guy shit on this cover. It was obviously from a place of appreciation and respect for Badu. This genre is similar but not totally his. And dude did his thing on it. Stop the hate spread love.
6LACK got soul!
Aye im not gonna lie to all y'all haters, in my opinion i think this shit is fire
I already know I'm gonna like this
Great voice. Soulful af
Straight Fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I already New it was going to be fire had to like it before he even started
This cover is pretty good!!!! Wtf are y'all smoking. 😂😂😂
6lack is my guy; great music, but this wasn't wow at all. more like an 'oh, aiight, that was cool, I guess' lol
Unenthusiastic has a face
I liked it, don't understand the hate, he should've been more vocally flexible he needed more range
Its a cover smh. Its supposed to be a lil differant.
So In Love with his voice! 😍
Not my style of music, but solid cover. 6lack has a strong set of pipes on him.
I heard dis song all my life... But he made me LISTEN. Badu was kicxin some REAL SHIT bac in da day...
6lack did justice baby, yasssssss. fuck it up 6LACK
Damn beautiful low tone
Can you just cover all her songs....thanks
My day has been blessed :)
They should do a collaboration 🔥
🔥
i can'tttttt<3
hoolyTv
why do i feel late
Amazing 👏🏽👏🏽
i know it's probably because Ben and Liam get a lot on unsolicited hate in the comments but I miss the little intros at the start of these videos it was always cool to see a bit of what the artist is like
Cant wait for the show in Atl!!! Zone 6 baby
Not bad at all
Not my style of music but i love it
6lack lookin like Hall & Oates in the She's Gone video
😍🎧🎤 #6lack #vibes
The way I love this guy’s voice
Fam killed it
Beautiful. \nGave me goosebumps when this was on the radio this morning!
Loved it ❤️❤️
I honestly love this
1:29 my favorite part 😍
6lack makes really good music, however, this cover should not have happened...like, at all.
I love this!! So soulful ❤ 6lack you did so dam good.
Huge! So well done xx
🔥🔥🔥
🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Loved it.
Badass cover!!
Oh shit ❤
IM FUCKING SHOOK OMFG

Best Like a Version in awhile
1000 level up from badu, sick !
Lethargic
*yawn*
Definitely respect the nod to Badu. But this wasn't a good cover of On & On to me. No disrespect to 6lack though.
Shit sucks
It sounds okay I guess, maybe because he looks so uninterested in everything it kinda puts me off, haha. There is a girl on Youtube who does a cover that's really nice, her name is Mudi
Six-lack never fails to amaze me
Best thing since they found heroine
Bring john butler on again
Yawn....
Crap
There's nothing remarkable about this.
This cover is trash lol this is disrespect lol
who is this sixlack?
Terrible voice
how did he fit that rat on his head under that small ass beanie
Erykah wanted to call him after hearing THIS ? Sounds lifeless to me. No feeling. #DontBelieveTheHype
I can foresee this getting 1,000,000 views by November who agrees like if u agree
i thought randy was going to do a sketch in a parking garage or on the phone with eminem
Omfg this is amazing. Also love the Desperate Cheeto. Who’s with me
Definitely the best video ever. My family's firm Puerto Rico too 🖕❤️ thanks randy
He kinda has a Charlie and the chocolate factory
My new favorite song like of you agree
Oh my god I love this so much

Desperate cheeto,why he tryna pretend hes helping puterico
Right on! Look up Tillerson's Song on YouTube, guys.
This is a good week for administration burns. This and Kellywise are required reading this week.
My favorite part of these videos is your glasses!  I love all of your other elements, too, but that's my favorite.
Who gave him A+'s? Him?
This was amazing. Thank you for it! Calling out the orange blob on Puerto Rico was necessary, funny, and touching.
Shared on Facebook, well done and keep them coming.  We are Canadian but we still think they are great.
Oh My GOD, Randy this is your best ever, you have really outdone yourself this time!!!\nxoxox
Absolutely brilliant. On behalf of my Puerto Rican side of the family, THANK YOU RANDY!!
This is amazing! Life saver for those of us looking for some normality in all this mess
This video is awesome - can't stop laughing every time I watch it.
Hey, Randy - since you clearly have an in with the White House, can you arrange a meeting between me and Trump?\nI got some things I'd like to get off my chest. :)
RANDY YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL AGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhh
Can you post these lyrics up somewhere?
HILARIOUS..This guy is sooooo talented...great job...and guess what: he is right, with every word he sings
I hope Trump gets to see this. He'll probably try to ban YouTube.
😆😆😆 this is so hilarious! You sir, just got a new subscriber 👍
I can't stop watching this....it is that good!
😂😂😂oml! I got it to 9k❤
I've now come back to watch this three times. So good
Omg... When I had first seen this I blew water all over my laptop busting into laughter! Like my new favorite song. Ahahaha...
IM DYING THIS SONG IS SO GENIUS AND FUNNY
Oh my goodness Randy, I have tears running down my face, that is brilliant! keep doing what you’re doing, you make this administration more bearable.
Poor Trump. This must be the first time he ever tried to pronounce a word in a language other than English.  Someone must have tried hard to teach him the pronunciation and get him to pick it up accurately.  But they failed.
All those dislikes I will hunt u down and dislike u
Every thing u said is sooo true
That song describes Donald Trump in every single way
I love this song. It's intelligent, hilarious, and spot on. Plus, Randy, you are just adorable and fun to watch!
I died at you're this color. I went to Home Depot, and the sign made me think about this video. I laughed so hard that I farted.
I solemnly dedicate my golf trophy to the victims of Hurricane Donald.\n\nRandy Rainbow, you're a light in the darkness. And a genius. And I love you.
Im so happy right now
The only reason there are dislikes is because people are mad that they didn't write this.
Good day,\n\nHAHAHAHAHA!!!\n\nThank You The tragedies are horrible, but this Yellow Bodied Cowardly LiAR-ito....\n\nThank you for your time.
Randy Rainbow is so pretty.
This guy needs to be a guest on SNL!
Been having a bad week, for about a year now!  ... In and out, in and out, three times - okay well lets not get into your sex life!\nLMAO! This is amazing!
Funny, but even funnier is Hilary's book!  How come everyone knows What Happened except her?
8000 to 142. Yeah, I think you nailed this one too. :D
You're my favorite human.
Who are the 141 people that disliked this? Is it Trump disliking it on numerous devices?
OMFG Randy's voice is amazing. Me and my daughter keep this song on repeat 😂 grabby braggadocios creepo is perfect
From France : you are a genius ! ;) xoxoxo
You may possibly be the Wind Beneath My Wings
Thank you Randy!  Just love and appreciate you so much!
😂😂😂😂😂😂 can't stop laughing, this is genius
Make a parody about him but using the song rolex
Randy’s wig is more convincing than Trump’s, and I can see the zipper.
So funny everything you said is Correct about him
thank you. MY NEW FAVORITE SONG! awesome
A guy from Puerto Rico Hit like on this video! Good!
I heard Justin Bieber did a parody of this song
I'm a fan for sure!  You freekin killed it.  Thanks from all of us Puerto Ricans!!!
Hilarious as usual. Thank you Randy, just what the doctor ordered 😂
We got very high marks! we got A+ pluses Good Boy ahaha\nthe feeling you get when you get A+ on your math test or any other subject :D
I love all your songs but I can't stop singing this one 😉😘😍❤
Your vocal range, is amazing...always in awe
I can’t stop watching this. I’ve listen to it about10 times now and I still want to listen to it again. Randy you’re addictive.

Justin Bieber lol
Hillarious🤣love it
Sweet voice!!
good boy !!!! lol
Down with donald duck trump
This why Trump will get 8 years. Thank you
My blood still boils and my BP rises at the disregard for human lives by this terrible horrible despicable man somehow elected as president. The nerve of a person with limited language skills and who can only speak one language at 4th grade level to mock those of us with accents and the loving way we pronounce our country's name is 'insoportable'.  Randy's parodies help me put things in perspective and bring my anger to a manageable level and my BP lower. He makes me laugh and I feel better all day.
Ah, Randy Rainbow, what was my life before I found you?  Personally, I blame my sister because she's been a fan for ages and never bothered to mention it lol <3
Another great one.  I don't know where you get all the continual creative energy from to do these.  If I had to watch as many videos of him as you do I would surely be heaving over the toilet most of the day. Thanks for getting through this sickness for us.
I could listen to you all day Randy.
bless whoever carved dat pumpkin at 3:38
YOU  SUCK...LMAO
Still better then hillary
A bit racist isn't it?  The next time there's a black president, will it be okay to poke fun at his skin?
Whats funnier the song or this faggot liberal. Too bad a total flame ass made this , funny parody but this is last guy/girl to make fun of anyone
Making fun of the President isn't going to get you anywhere especially your career.  Have some pride in yourself or maybe you have a little too much of the WRONG pride.
A few flat earthers die of heart ache after each spacex video :)
wow Echostar 105? I worked at the company way back when they launched Echostar VI and VII.
elon is actually a Martian just trying to get back home. :(
THE ONLY THING NASA PUT IN TO SPACE IS YOUR MIND                                                                                            Look on  YOUTUBE Eric Dubay 200 Proofs Earth is Not a Spinning Ball
I dont understand how people think we can colonize mars soon when we only been to the moon a few times and alls we did was collect rocks
Like 2 more Elons and we'll be set.
Great work! Congrats to the whole team at SpaceX.
Steady for a while at max speed at around 8000 kph. With this speed, we can reach Mars in 2.85 years. Not that long...and worth to wait
The technology and equipment are good...
I would like to see G forces too in the telemetry section. Would be a nice thing to visualize acceleration.\n\nThumbs up if you want it too! :D
Wow! Kerbal Space Program has great graphics since the last updatr
Every time Tom (the host) comes on and says he is a Firmware engineer all i here is, I am a Former Engineer and my first thought is WHY ARE YOU HOSTING THEN!?
Can I suggest that when you make your rocket to mars that you create a component called The Illudium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator?
Can anyone with asthma answer this survey please. This is for my dissertation and everything will be kept anonymous. THANK YOU \nhttps://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/6S2XZ9D
Why is it on fire prelaunch? What was it doing?
the real one crashed they switched cams to the other barge with the prop.

Why don't you ever show a launch from the camera of a satellite or satellites? So we could see the whole operation   of launching to landing.
SpaceX makes NASA look like the overpaid old timers afraid of change they are.
ArianeSpace and ULA are toast! \nSpaceX ate their lunch with Falcon 9. It's a very successful launch technology and SpaceX is already leaving it behind. \nNow Elon will show up the SLS with BFR! \nI cannot wait to see those things coming out of the sky and landing on a launch pad.
2017 and Space companies are still using potatoes to record :/
Anyone wanna explain the space-blizzard at 41:00?
WoW was this fastest re-entry  ? Fins glowing white and plasma show up..... WoW
what if it flies over north korea and they get the wrong idea
what the hell is that camera doing ? seriously? you send rocket to space and you cant tilt the camera steadily?
Point of order!!!! You are not launching from Cape Canaveral. KSC is technically on Merritt Island. ;-)
İ Choice The Blue Pill   Morpheus  Musk !!
Subtitles seem to be about 11 minutes behind the audio(!)
SpaceX  you need a concert like TOMITA Live at Linz in Austria 2 as you send off  :)
Ah thought they had lost the first stage there for a minute would have been there first failure is a while when it was starting to look like they may have got landing the first stage down pat, they return 69 on them and they will have a better return success rate than the space shuttle, if we cut off the earlier failures which I would because the Falcon 9 is a refined rocket compared to the original Falcon 9, it's not the same machine really.\n\nAlthough having a better track record than the space shuttle is not exactly a compliment, I would like to see the Falcon 9 get to a 100,000 consecutive successful missions without a failure which was the original rating for the space shuttle... which was a bit off. But it probably wont reach that even if it never fails again because BFR should eventually be able to take over for it expect for when you need a launch window which BFR will not be ready for, because I assume that a BFR will be in maintenance for at least 6 months between maybe 5 launches and landings so if you have a fleet of 5 for example that would only give you 50 launches per year so if you need a specific launch window you will probably be shit out of luck, which is why you will still need a few Falcon 9's and Falcon Heavys laying around even if/when BFR has demonstrated it's reliability.\n\nUnless they are going to have a fleet of 37 BFR's to cover every day of the year, and building and maintaining 4-5 BFR's is already ambitious.
Its weird that Tesla cars actually accelerate faster, if you compare them side by side. The rocket just keeps going. I imagine the time when we will launch stuff to space from huge magnetic cannons, made out of hyperloops that then ignite while already hundreds of meters above ground and going just a little under speed of sound already. Could save alot of liftoff fuel payload.
This is not Russia vs America... This humanity vs extinction  ... We are all brothers and sisters... Indian guy here going I could be a part of space x some day... :D
The Russians are known for their secrecy.
Reusing rockets: what's the big deal - I do it on Kerbal all time, and with a real short turn around time: you say this is not the same thing???? ;) Congrats Elon - and people say: What can one person do? Well how about changing the whole world and much for the better?
Saw it from my back yard, 168mi south of the Cape. Awesome!
Excellent choice of music.
It's really wonderful. When I'm watching when this rocket is returning from space and landing, I feel like I'm watching the next chapter in space exploration. Congratulations to SpaceX. Elon Musk, I do not think you have time to read the comments, but you know how to inspire people.
How I love these starts.. more please! Also: Mars! I hope once the crew is on it's way there are daily videos of how things going - will watch it! Nothing boring in pushing the boundaries of mankind :)
You are the best
I recently flew on a 4 engine 747... can't imagine 20 engine's and how I would possibly survive, LOL!!!
I can understand camera getting screwed on re-entry, but surely the barge camera can have better than potato quality/connection. Still, awesome work. Look forward to much more and oneday seeing 31 raptor engines firing in all their glory.
Its so complicated to do, yet this video makes it look so easy.  Musk is a force of progress.
Elon Musk is the greatest foreigner to come to America since the time of Nikola Tesla. Bravo Mr. Musk.\nWish you lots of luck on your endeavors.\nIf you take advantage of everything America has to offer there's nothing you can't accomplish- Geraldine Ferraro
if they develop this rocket any further they might just go to the moon some day!
i cannot wait for the BFR
It's a bit strange that it cut out on the landing.
@23:40 In space, they play techno.
Watched it live couldn't comment at time shame visuals were lost of rocket landing but seen most of its journey well done
All bow down to Elon Musk our savior. What I would give to work with him....He will save the world.
Best\nName \nFor\nA\nDroneship
I just love SpaceX! What an extraordinary gang! They just do it :D.\nWould have been nice to see some telemetry data from the 2nd stage during its long flight.\nBut a great presentation anyway. I love watching these launches!
Is it just me or did they attach new cameras, way better quality this time around
I love the drone ship names...\nOf Course I Still Love You\nJust Read the Instructions
13:54 Thank me later...
Such a beautiful takeoff!

20:54
7:02 hellooooooooooooooooooo there !  *.*
Super décollage, bravo à vous.
Thanks for a very interesting and informative video. \n\nI am curious.. After the satellite has been released, what do you do with the part of the rocket, carrying the satellite? Do you fly it back into the earth' atmosphere, so it burns up and falls into the ocean or that happens with it? \n\nIf that is the case, how much is left when it hits the water. Are we talking parts of a few centimeters or more?\n\nKeep up the good work. I love what you are doing to the world.
The most amazing transportation vehicle and its formed like a penis
Why is the drone ship named Of Course I Still Love You?
others can gripe but SpaceX is showing the way forward efficient to the point of 2 launches in 3 days 2 returns in 3 days multiple satellites launched without drama, they are a trucking company doing what they do best, and by developing their own equipment they control quality, remember the plan for BFR is the equivalent of launching a decent sized 4000 ton ship into orbit and reusing it as well multiple times, we really are at a crossroads
Why did they land on the barge instead of land?  I thought land was preferable now that it has been figured out
Excuse me, I've got a question (and maybe a stupid one, because I don't know what could be the answer). Instead of focusing and spending so much money on reaching Mars, wouldn't be better to focus on asteroid mining technology? I think that once that we will be capabel to gain materials in the space, we will be able to build our rockets directly in space, so that the ammount of fuel needed will be much less becouse we will have no more to escape our gravity.\nHope that someone could clarify me that point.
@43:40 can somebody please explain why the speed of second stage is decreasing? Shouldn't it remain constant?
What's the nuclear bomb looking thing in the background at 22:12
@spacex is that the first stage landing at 22:12 on the left side one the screen?
What is on the horizon at 22:12? It looks like a nuke detonation.
I wish they would display m/s instead of km/h
Lots of space junk visible on the left camera as the 1st stage is prepping for return to earth. That's going to be a problem pretty soon I would say.
every day seems they send something up...the elite moving out?
I bore my other half to tears alot of the time when I talk about Elon Musk and the whole Space X operation... Not to mention those phenomenally stunning Tesla vehicles. He is a true visionary willing to risk his own wealth for mankind to step foot and even reside on Mars... Obviously it would mean a stupendous amount of wealth WHEN it succeeds. Would love to sit and have a coffee and chat with Elon. I admire his focus and drive on getting us to the red planet. I'm 99.999% sure Space X will get the first structure on Mars ahead of NASA.
weird looking rocket. lot of fancy paintings but still less than half as good as Russian rockets which take off so beautifully, very safe and reliable, unlike this american junk. here's how a rocket should take off: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzsRjru86s

Where does the second stage end up going? Does it just drift endlessly now?
Are there people inside?
So is it time to start buying spaceX stock?
Ok...what happened at 14:55?
What is that at 22:13 on the edge of the Earth?   Is that the sun? Or stage 1?  Sorry if that's a silly question.
SpaceX should send a new rocket to space everyday
is there anything in your rockets with batteries? like the most normal AA batteries. it'd be so hilarious...\nlike Energiser, the Most Space Batteries Ever Made (Elon Musk award) and stuff.\noh the agony of my normal side.
Flat ?
***NEED AN ANSWER: *** so when the stage 2 rocket is activated the traveling speed starts to go up quickly as there is few friction in the atmosphere at 300km altitude. At minute 42:02 immediately the speed stops to 35'262 km/h and then starts going back. How this? An object launched at so high speed how can instantly stop?????!!! Shouldn't have a continuos movement as there is no friction!?  Thanks to all for answer
elon ! you are gettıng lame  hahahha
The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, friends! \n\nRepent of your sins and put your faith in Jesus. \n\nHe Loves you, so please do not listen to the lies of the devil. Jesus Loves you so much, He died so that you may live. \n\nJudgement is swiftly approaching, and the Only Way to escape is through Jesus Christ. \n\nSo please, if you haven't called upon The Lord, do so today. You will be forgiven. You will be saved. You will be renewed! \nHe promises to never drive you away, so please don't listen to men and women, instead seek Jesus. He is all you need! \n\nShalom, friends.
20:59 Damn is this plasma ?? Good thing the first stage survived reentry
CGI is getting so realistic
There is an imperfecto ruler right now and nobody gets it either.
Omg I love this Cliff guy so much! So full of energy and you can really tell he loves his work. I wanna be like Cliff when I grow as old as he is.
For some reason this guy reminds me of Scott Bakula.
Great video! Having that sort of mentality can get you into trouble at work sometimes, people just want instant results these days and consider curiosity a waste of time. I just had a shitty day at work because of that and I feel better now knowing there are different people out there.
what is 1110 to the power of 1111 ?
You are cruel! I love it.
He missed a couple of assumptions:  Even if you caught the two 17's on the ruler, whose to say the ruler is calibrated correctly?  And if you're using the other sheet of paper to check squareness, you better know that your source sheet is also square.
Legend has it that his brain is a Klein bottle
Awwwww, Metriiic!  Do I have toooooo!?\n\nI don't know how I would have handled this as a student.
I would conjecture that the likely enduring memory of his students would not relate to mathematics, but rather be something along the lines of, Trust less.
theres holes in the paper
Paper size nerd. The second he gave the measurements, I knew something was off.
I think if you get Cliff Stoll and Matt Parker together, tell them go off come up with something together in secret, you have 3-12 months, as needed, the result would be *spectacular!*
Hey Numberphile, so I found this geometric puzzles called Euclidea. You can feature some problems there. It will be interesting to watch mathematicians doing that game.
That guy is a beauty
It was Hilbert: Wir müssen wissen, wir wereden wissen, in response the the Latin maxim igroamus et ignorabimus (we do knot know and we will not know).\n\nI hate not being able to solve a puzzle. It will consume me until I know. This is a trait I have in common with a very large number of scientists and engineers. I think it's innate rather than taught. Some people are happy not to know.
How on earth can he forget Hilbert's name?
I don't really know about doing an integral, but couldn't I just measure and subtract the area of the triangles that are made when the papers are lined up? 1:45
HOW DID HE EXPLAIN OWNING AN IPHONE I NEED TO KNOW
I would use a scanner to determine the area. Would just need to determine how much area each pixel is.
I feel like noticing the trapezoid paper (and the innacurate ruler) is one of the few things that would be easier in American units, because our papers are all 8.5x11, so when you start measuring and it's 8.45x10.9, something's wrong. If it's 8.45x9.9, there's something very wrong.
Can numberphile make a video on infinity - infinity =π
Cliff both looks like and has the same speech patterns as Rick Sanchez.
Clifford Stoll is a Ph.D. astronomer. But back in 1986, while employed as a systems administrator at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Stoll investigated a tenacious hacker, one who stole $0.75 of computer time (back when you had to rent computer time-no one owned computers back then)—later identified as a KGB agent—who stole passwords, pirated multiple computer accounts, and attempted to breach US military security. \n\nStoll was tenacious and needed to KNOW even then-I mean, how many people would devote months trying to find a $0.75 accounting error?\n\nAfter identifying the intrusion, Stoll set up a honeypot for Hess, eventually tracking him down and passing details to the authorities. It is recognized as one of the first examples of digital forensics. He described the events of his investigation in The Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage, which was a huge international best seller, and is an excellent book that I highly recommend.
For a moment I thought I was watching Julias Sumner Miller. Those were the days.
My first thought was the ruler tbh.
i was a little sad about my future, but after i watched this, it encouraged me.
This guy is what indiana jones would look like when teaching
Cliff is great, would have liked to have had him as a teacher for sure. Enthusiasm is important
This guys brain is wired just like mine
I like that feeling
I want to ask that guy a question
Is the Earth pear shaped?
Why don’t more teachers do this? You know, make students think. This man is brilliant.
So enthusiastic about his work.. I Really like him...mathematically speaking..
have he done a video about everyone is 7 handshakes away from the president? i found that odd
i love this guy
This man looks like Einstein on weed
Acting outlandishly can get you a fair bit of mileage.
I thought that one of the interpretations would include measuring the depth of the paper by folding it and using the depth to find the area of its edge-like sides.
He should be collecting royalties off Dr. Emmett Brown.
the moment I saw the homework assignment, I immediately thought that I would measure it by attempting to cut a shape of known area, and weighing that piece. Then weighting the whole sheet and multiplying by the known mass per a unit of area (this is how we used to do it for figuring the area under a chromatography trace.)\n\nFor the sides, I was thinking I would cut the paper into several pieces and stack them, to get the thickness of the paper, but I am not sure how precisely the cut edge of the paper matches its thickness.
He is weird, but amazing!
Can someone help me find a value of n that works other than 2:\nn^3-1= prime #
This is beautiful, Cliff
I want to be his student
Great advice for youngsters, and others too.
I actually hired someone not once, but twice for two different companies because he said in the first interview “I don’t know, but I know I can figure out the problem if I had more time and the right tools.” This was after he tried to trouble shoot a timed, and impossible to solve, hardware problem (yes I rigged it).
I love him so much 💗💗💗
His students are lucky.
I loved this!! What an awesome guy! And super interesting
This guy should have a TV show only for himself
I still don't know how to meassure the paper properly now.
How is this man still not knighted?
This guy is AMAZING !!!!
I would assume there would be some chance that the students results in many cases would not match based on which edges they measured.\nSo then, have them explain why . This would be interesting to observe.\n\nMight experiment on my kids ... now where do i get an imperfecto  ruler.  Must be one in my garage somewhere.
I knew he was probably gonna tell me that measuring a piece of paper may not be as streight forward as I think... but this.. I didn't expect this..... awesome.
and no students notices that with that definitely Trumpfakish ruler, the usual 20x27cm sheet of paper measured... 20x26cm ;-) (check on the video)
This video probably had a larger impact on me than 4 years of high school teachers. Education is so much more than standardized tests and memorization. It's about learning how think and feel and react. This was beautiful.
This 5 minute video conveys a sense of scientific rigor so amazingly well!\nI love this so much, I emailed it around the intro physics lab department at my university yesterday morning.  This morning, we're talking about maybe using this as the first lab of the fall semester for next year's program.\n8th grade?  The lessons in this video apply at all levels of research.
o didn't think you'd be an iPhone guHILBERT DAVID HILBERT
That's really educational!\nBtw, I was unintentionally expecting a cry of Great Scott lol
He goes on about the desire to know things, only to go all around trying to find that mathematician's name. That's one way to show you stick to your philosophy!
3:50 This is something that comes natural in CERTAIN areas. For some people its science others its math, others its English.
Find the minimum value of (10a+13)^1/2+(10b+15)^1/2 given that a+b=10
This is the kind of teacher I aspire to be.
Can Cliff Stoll be my professor?  Please?
Make a model of the paper and measure the paper with photographs and electron beams and write some simple software to measure the output and report on surface area. Measure model map I always say. Thanks for the Hilbert quote. We will know!!
Can you fill a klein bottle with watter?
I really wish I had been a student in one of Cliff's classes. He has such great enthusiasm for everything and I love his take on maths and sciences! Every Numberphile video I watch featuring him makes me super happy and pumped! If he ever did an encore class, I'd do everything in my power to attend as I envy his former students!
I would love to have him as a teacher
I was surprised to see it’s not a rant by Matt Parker!
The one thing I must know is who would dislike this video.
Is there a place where we can get like a PDF copy or something of the imperfecto ruler he uses, or is it a secret of cliff only
I'm almost certain that drive for knowledge is learned, not a natural gift. If you've got it, some event in your past showed you learning how to discover a fundamental truth is empowering in any future dealings with the subject of that truth.
I love Cliff.  He's just so enthusiastic and it's contagious
I love this guy, he's so animated and engaged.
The Klein bottle guy. You are Awesome..
Cliff, if you teach a math class at school, I would gladly drop everything and go back to school, that school to be specific
This was exactly how I got a job as a sound tech in college! They asked why I wanted the job with no experience, I just said, every time I walk by a sound board, I want to know what all those knobs do.\nThe real answer was that I didn't want to work in the dish pit, but I got in regardless.
Homework every night? No thanks
1.21 jiggawatts
This is sooooo cooooool!!!!
Yes.
Savage Klein bottle guy
What a delightful person.
We love parker square!
This guy is sooo cool.
Klien bottle guy!
Fantastic
Do modulo inverse plssss :”((
Real life Doc. Brown
Cliff reminds me of doc brown
I feel cheated.
Cliff rocks!
YAYYYY CLIFF!!!
Amazing! :D
Mad genius
Inspiring guy
great advice! I was caught.\ner. why two '17' on the ruler? lol. about the wrong 'tool' to use?
BEST RIRI SONG EVER?? Mine is We Found LOVE...\n\nLETS START A THREAD....
this part 14:59 omfg im in tears
Hell yes zoom was the best child hood
I'm oldest out of 2.
Big, big congrats to you both! You are amazing and she is genuinely so beautiful and you guys are amazing together. Make me look like Riri please lol x

WAIT THATS NOT RIHANNA WTF
Omg I thought this was riri fr
MIDDLE
They look like twins
Damn this girls forehead shape looks exactly like riri
She's beautiful :)
You can hit the bombs back at the Broodal when she's dropping bombs everywhere. It won't knock her hat off but it will end the phase sooner.
ONLY. TWO. WEEKS.
Okay then, the movement in this game looks super cool.
I can tell this was at target from the walkie noise
Oh shit watching these demo speedruns are my new favorite thing now
You wasted so much time waiting for the Broodal to finish her UFO phase. If you throw Cappy at one of the bombs she drops, it will hit her and knock her out of the sky, ending the phase like 5 seconds earlier.
They should just give you a free copy
Jesus, the game isn't even released yet.
Well done... can't imagine what you'll accomplish with the final game.
Awesome speed run! The hat throw is going to be really broken!
I love learning how to master how Mario controls in 3D Mario games and watching this speedrun only made me more excited to play Odyssey.
Holy shit\nThere is already a speed run of this game
In Super Mario 64 we had long jump spamming. In Super Mario Sunshine we had dive spamming. Now in Super Mario Odyssey we have rolling spamming. History repeats itself.
My target had the demo, and when I started it, the TV was at like max volume or something. Mario yelled “SUPA MARIO ODISEE” on it, and everyone within 30 feet of me stopped and stared at me
When you're an expert at a game that hasn't even come out yet.
This was from the Gamecity in Vienna right?
Make an eshop demo Nintendo!
He was born here
The speed-running potential for this game is insane and it’s not even out yet
3:35 THAT MOVEMENT THO
0:21 Mario jumping Trump's wall.
Definitely one or two things that could’ve been done a second faster, but overall this is pretty good. As someone who wants to speedrun this game myself, I can’t wait to get a hold of the game and start learning the controls. Also want to test a few things to see what can and can’t be done for skips, glitches, and overall time saves.
I hate how they nerfed the long jump, I was fine with it in Galaxy but its called a long jump for a reason
Wow how often did you play this demo?
Speedrun of demo...
Nice run dude! Looks like the rolling is super efficient as I've thought!
There's actually a demo of this game out there?
My target has no demo ;(
How do you do the constant rolling?
SO. FUCKING. EXCITED. I mean fire emblem warriors will be good n all. but odyssey is where it's at
THANKYOU for this content! good movement was all I wanted to see but it's nowhere
There are no bad points in this game now!
This is giving the game some really good publicity
I think ground pounding on her head would've wrap the broodal fight up in just two hits.
So far the game isnt out and I can see the speedrunning possiblities are going to be amazing THUMBS UP!!
Dang the game isn’t even out and yet people are already speed running it.
Idk if this is true but I noticed that when you get close to her she’ll back up then attack a lot faster than just waiting for to attack
I can already see this will be great for speedrunning from this alone
this game is going to be so awesome to speedrun, especially 100% run
When you hang out all day at Circuit City playing the demos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4OYXpKxHT4&t=7m52s here is the bomb reflect people are talking about.
I hope speedruns like this stay a thing when the game comes out. 10 min challenges and what not. It'd be fun to watch lol
Basically it's Mario spindashing at sanic speed.
The game is not even out yet and there is a speed run of it XD
I hope this starts a trend.
Holy fuck you are a psycho at this props to u
Damn dude. Great job! Where did u do this?
wow fast make new video
Ohhh god, I actually can’t wait for this game to come out just for the speed runs
ROLLING AROUND AT THE SPEED OF WAHOO.
i subscribed & i turned on the notification bell on, when you buy the game when it comes out speedrun it, your gameplay was smart af.
Rolling around at the speed of sound. Oh wait wrong series...
i love how mario is sonic now
america is so lucky damn
Holy fuck you’re really good!
And 3:29 SUPER MARIO GALAXY RETURNS
CoolCat Moon Get CoolCat
Congrats on World Record.
lmao
12 days til' Christmas!
guiijiii!
Amazing speedrun!
Kool
What?!
Dude\n\nWhat the fuck
daaaaamn man. Nice!
Awesome!
Nice run mate
Why do  you Always throw cappy before a Dive  even  when you are not Diving into cappy?
But first we need to talk about parallel universes.
0:04 sanic gotta go fast
Nice
Not fair! The demo at my target ended at 2:25
Great.\nNow do it in 0.5 a presses.
How do you get this demo?
What buttons do you press to do the rolling move??\n\nAlso what buttons allow you to get back to your hat once you have thrown it?
This is so damn absurd and I love it. This game is gonna make my year.
How do you get the demo
you odyssey this game its amazing
These speed runs make this feel like a true successor to super Mario 64. \nI'm sure some would prefer Galaxy or Sunshine, but this takes the cake.
I'm worried that the game seems rather empty due to the expansive landscapes not being more filled with objects.
And how did you get the demo?
this is a record that cannot be broken after the demo stands are beeing removed, you set an unbeatable world record! :D good job
These demos being speedrunned only makes me realise that if the 3D mario game after Odyssey DOES NOT HAVE a cappy equivalent (in terms of jumping toolset), the game will be automatically inferior.
Imagine the poor souls waiting their turns in line behind this guy
Why can't they have a demo on the switch?? Not in target or Best Buy of Walmart or anything...
sincerely, i cried watching this video. but then when he started dancing i thought there would be a sick twist where he danced and fell into the pool. \n\nso glad i was so wrong.
I almost cried 😩 This is a good video for the song. The song deserves a Grammy and the video, an Emmy! ☺️I never expected something like this!
It would be great if they released an alternative video which is just Thundercat, Michael McDonald & Kenny Loggins performing in the clouds
In Chile and other latinoamericana countries, TKM is used as an informal acronym for Te k(q)uiero mucho, which translated means I love you so much\nThat's exactly how I feel about Michael McDonald, Kenny Loggins and Thundercat... and the video of course :)
Nice to see Toro y Moi help the samurai get back in his groove.
00:29 what kind of synth is that
Kenny, Michael, and Thundercat....on a track. Wat??
I didn't know who Thundercat was, but his powers of smooth music are great enugh reunite Kenny and Michael! Damn I'm a fan! Check out Yaght Rock for the whole story. Funny ASF!
You know you've made it when you sing on a miniature cathode television with freakin' Kenny Loggins and Michael f-ing McDonald! Glad to see them up and running :)
What a song! But a very weird video lol
I heard of him from some Kendrick songs and I'm happy I accidentally stumbled upon this.
Dude with the glasses look like Toro...
The chorus is so
He will get his arms back in the future.
i follow the truth JIMMY ..
I was at a ramen joint waiting for my bowl when I saw the video on my feed I clicked on it and the first thing I saw was the samurai and I had to really keep myself from screaming so I had to pause the video and wait for me to leave the ramen joint and watch video at home, lol
Everybody was using his snapchat filter and most people didn't even know it was for his album!  😩😤
This song is beautiful I can’t stop listening
This is some GOOOOD ass Music!! DAMN!!
Thundercat bringin' that smooth R&B
What is this Shananigans?!
This was actually far more uplifting than I expected it to be
Is this a real family and he is actually missing his arms ?
damn stop abusing my experience with my now disabled mother and squeezing out my tears 😥
this song is so beautiful and magical
Quick! Someone make a rad vaporwave edit!
Coco would be proud of such smooth music
I absolutely love this! 😍
I really didn't think we'd get a continuation to the armless samurai's story. Strangely glad we did.
So glad to see him all positive and happy :)
I absolutely love seeing black cinema that transcends the trite bullshit that typically comes out of racist Hollywood.
Thundercat is a genius this has me crying tears of joy
damn thundercat mustve found the most soulful sounding white ppl ever. almost cried
Never thought I would see a music video sequel to Them Changes.
He slapped the black off of him lol 1:40
I thought this was KRS-One in the thumbnail
Call video. I thought for sure there was going to be a moment when his arms would sprout out after he got the crap out of his head and let his demons free in the sky. I’m not sure if this was supposed to be symbolic of someone shackled by depression or addiction, so I kept seeing the metaphor of the crap released from his head and the black birds flying away. Way to play the whole cheesy Loggins McDonald cheesy angle in the sky. Thunder is very cool. And is on my #selfiebucketlist
3:57 At the end of it alllll...
I love this song.
0:54 That was the Sonic 1 twinkle.
It took 2 goddamn years... But gosh, I'm so happy for this man ♥
Wtf this is a phenomenal featuring
I been listening to this song alot! Love that he released a video for it
Why does Booker T have no arms?
did tyler the creator shoot his music video for answer there?
thundercat always hits me right in the feels, man 😩😭
So, in the last instalment, he's gonna get mechanoid arms, right? Then Evil Red Lobster Samurai's in the shit... 🤣
1:07 Donald Glover is that you?!?!
if he falls in that pool he's fucked
Fuck yes I waiting for a video for this song, THANK YOU! Lol
the video dope and and all but how did ol' dude drive to the clinic??
Michael McDonald & Kenny Loggins are so legendary, so nice with Thundercat.
You're constantly making that music that changes the flavour of the bubblegum I'm chewing, Thundercat!
I'm not crying, you're crying.
Loll this video already iconic. Thundercat always has the best videos
The samurai is back and mentally better. Now this makes me wanna go watch them changes. Hope there is a part three for this story.
how far does this samurai story arc reach to?
So disrespectful. He doesn't even open the brochure at the beginning smh 😔😔😔😤
Walk On By should be about the other samurai
Amazing amazing AMAZING!!!
Im sorry but I cried. Healing the wounds of this brother the metaphors are overwelming- thanks T. Wellness = Healing.
The world is so depressing at the moment, thanks for giving the samurai an ending he deserved!
Get the depression slapped out of you.
Thundercat is legend for having a followup to one of the most depressing music videos ive ever seen.
I clicked soon as I saw the thumbnail
This is actually beautiful...
Uhhh, that was seriously fucking heartwarming, bro. I needed that and it was perfect timing!

Great album
Tkm or tkc? Tkm probably for thundercat Kenny Michael but still continuity error spotted
I kind of wish the internet didnt have to spoil the surprise of kenny loggins and michael mcdonald being on a thindercat album. I just imagine watching this video or listening to this song for the first time, w/o the prior knowledge, and  it would have been hilarious.
At the beginning the brochure says TKM Wellness. At the end of the video it says TKC Wellness  WHAT DOES THIS MEAN, LORD?!

Sorry to say but I need to say good bye Jimmy not cool I was a big fan too will miss you my friend 😭 The politatic is getting out of hand, we are almost at war with North Korea. I was over in Afghanistan for our freedom and you don't support our country and our troops  I am so disappointed in you good bye Jimmy your big former fan 😢\n.
You were so much cooler when you were on The Man Show. now you just a puppet!
Argh I think it’s quite sweet that dopey donny jr tries to stick up for dopey donny sr. If only he had the intelligence to pick a fight he could ever win. It’s. Like watching a lion play with a kitten.
Ah Fredo needs to the get smart..sigh!
Lol and what’s funny is, “daddy on the Hollywood bus” still beat Hillary
Hey Jimmy, you are the mentally sick weirdo who put a lot of young women 18s to touch your pants in the street and infront of your cameras expecting all of your viewers to like that..psycho....
Fu Jimmy
Anybody who votes for George Soros candidates hate freedom and prosperity.
Jimmy Kimmel is a great dude.he loves women just watch him host the man show.beer tittys and a midget that trys to buy beer as a minor.hes not a sexiest how dare you say that
this guy just appeals for idiots
What's with the politics on talk shows? Jr was literally asking Kimmel for his thoughts. You don't want this kind of thing then ask those stupid media hungry assholes that are in power to stop.
i am positive at least one time in jimmys career, he took advantage of his position and asked for a sexual favor from an intern or something. he is NOT innocent
gotta love cry babys still mad Hillary got smashed by trump lol what a bunch of waa waa boi's
what's the difference between kimmel and weinstien? weinsien got caught
Sum establish ahead issue symbol officer economic pay market participation.
Damn, Jimmy just sh*tted on the Chumps...I mean Trumps. My apologies.
Donald Trump Jr has more class and intelligence than Kimmel.  Kimmel asks teenagers to grab his crotch. Trump junior runs one of the biggest companies on earth.
Keep fighting the Good Fight JK! \nYour efforts can help us come together on Gun Control and Health Care
Dare you to fight Harvey Weinstein! Why fight your president and get nothing done when you know how many women truly hurt  by this man? Well of course not, your president can’t hurt you but guys like Harvey Weinstein can hurt your career!
I am glad that he mentioned the highly corrupt Hillary Clinton at the same time as the clown  of America  named Trump.
wow    i wanted to come to america so badly because i thought the people here were much more mature accepting polite and much better but it seas that grown men are getting in to twitter fights with children and mocking them for something their father did
Seems Jimmy here forgot about his time on the man show parading around teens in miniskirts jumping on trampolines.
As soon as late night stops bashing Trump, I'll find something else to watch. I can't get enough of Dumbass Donald jokes.\nKeep it up Jimmy. You've never been better.
I like jimmy. Good banter with guests but he reminds us of more important things and shows emotion.
Donald Trump IQ test results is: Error 404 brain not found,  IQ test failed 0/99999999999999999....
Snoop you used to be gansta now you looking like a dope head
Really? Snoop is wearing fake glasses? Seems to be a black thing. Though mostly it seems to be Africans who wear those. Do they think they look more intellectual wearing these fake glasses?
So you ignored Harvey because someone tweeted at you.  If anyone bought that then America is in trouble. I think you may have a lot in common with Weinstein and it hit home.  Plus your puppetmasters at the studio pulled your silent string.  I guess it was hard tying this into your sons illness. Or perhaps you have lured a few potential starlets.
This was so funny!
Did you think we forgot about your Guess What's In My Pants Game, Jimmy Kimmel?  Your hypocrisy is stunning.  Hollywood is about one second away from imploding.  Do you ever examine your heart?
Just from his repeatitive speech skit, it's obvious he's just full of cliche business slogans and has no original independant thoughts in that empty head of his lol
I'm so glad Trump is Jimmy Kimmel's president ! Hahahahahaha  The more the media and hollywood hate Trump the happier I am. Go Trump !
Jimmy Kimmel was happy to get buggered by Weinstein several times to get his job..TRUE FACT..at least i think so
Any Canadians here just for the drama
I salute you!  God Bless you and your family!
What's most disturbing, is that Trump jr seems to have no idea that what his dad is doing, is so:  1. Stupid, and 2. Horrible for the vast majority of Americans. Or, he's just lying. Either way, he's a terrible person.
Savage!!!!
Jimmy- your awesome!!
Aww Jimmy Kimmel is such an adorable child
RememberJimmy did bit and had 18 yr old girl grab and guess what's in his crotch??!! It's a famous segment he did on his show which is on YouTube. 
Jimmy don't start a fight, you'll end up crying again.
The Donald Trump criticism show with jimmy kimmel sucks
war between lilliput people...whether great man (gulliver) interferes again?
This show is terrible...they all are now.
Honestly, I had no idea who Harvey Weinstein was before this.
And cue more trump hate. Stop it and your ratings will go up
What’s in your pants Jimmy?  You hypocrite.
I lasted 15 seconds. Which is long for me 😉
I only feel bad for donald trump jr for his name, Donald Trump, literally this explains how much ego Trump (the president) has
That I can tell you and I guarantee it are both things I say all the time... Ugh...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZ8i6EGH4FI\nSTOP BLAMING GUNS! Howard Stern DESTROYS the gun control Argument
He doesn't get flu shots. Come on.
Dotard Jr. is gonna learn to stay in a child's place after that. Lmao
What's in your pants, Jimmy?
Jimmy Kimmel, 'the conscience of America' has teenage girls grope his croutch for a seat see his show.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnGInJ5C-qI
I think next time Jimmy bashes Trump .. let Sean Hannity take the reins .. to respond. He would mop the floor with Kimmel.
And now Kimmel is on tape having young women feel around his groin area and asking them to put whatever is in there in their mouth.
Jimmy don't worry you're anniversary of that time where you had women with big breast jump up and down on a trampoline is coming up too.
Where are your weinstein jokes...so sad what you became.
Why don't Twitter BAN Trump's account? What would he do? It could be a lot of fun😜
Jimmy is killing it these days.
I love when he uses most people don't even know when it comes to common knowledge, like Lincoln being a Republican,and countless others!
what a whiner.  go home
Hey Jimmy you hypocrite, how was that 18 year old you had feel you up on the Man Show in 2002?
Forgot Harvey Weinstein, what about you, you creep Jimmy!?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBDYGOzViuI\n\nHey girls, feel what's in my pants, use your mouth if you want.
jimmy, I hope your kid takes its last breathe.
Jimmy 👏🏽 back was amazing!!!!! DJTJ stay in your lane.... I’m starting to believe that the stupid gene is Contagious and I guarantee it maybe “ in my DJTS voice”
Look at Jimmy getting down with all the colored people at 1:35. Lol, modern slavery at its finest.
so ScrewYouTube allows AdSense on fight videos - ok, got it
Jimmy Kimmel is a complete utter fake tosser.
Clownest president ever.
The what’s in your pants bit you did is leaps and bounds worse than anything that can be proven against Trump but keep trying to preach to us idiot
we don't believe you Mr =======
Here’s How Trump Has Silently Gutted Obama’s Legacy\nPosted By Robert Donachie On 11:30 AM 10/13/2017\n\nPresident Donald Trump has surgically dismantled Obamacare over the course of his first year in office, largely under the noses of the American public, Democrats and members of his party that have spent the last nine months trying to upend the American health care system.\n\nOver the course of his first nine months in office, he rolled back funding for a program intended to help individuals navigate the insurance marketplace, signed an executive order to allow for groups to purchase insurance across state lines and stopped federal funding for Obamacare subsidies.\n\nTaken in tandem, it appears the administration is working to overhaul the American health care system without the help of Congress, a body that has failed a handful of times to repeal and replace Obamacare during the first months of Trump’s presidency.\n\nEach of these actions has a significant impact on the viability of the current health care system.\n\nObamacare Subsidies\n\nThe Trump administration announced late Thursday evening that it will no longer fund a crucial feature of Obamacare that helps low-income Americans purchase health insurance on the Affordable Care Act state exchanges, known as cost-sharing reductions.\n\n“The bailout of insurance companies through these unlawful payments is yet another example of how the previous administration abused taxpayer dollars and skirted the law to prop up a broken system,” the White House said in a statement. “Congress needs to repeal and replace the disastrous Obamacare law and provide real relief to the American people.”\n\nUnder the leadership of former Speaker John Boehner, the House filed suit against the Obama administration in 2014, claiming it was illegally reimbursing marketplace insurers for CSRs.\n\nObamacare subsidies were instituted to help low and moderate income individuals who participate in the exchanges. To make consumers put more “skin in the game,” Obamacare effectively raised deductibles to levels that are tough for many Americans to meet without some financial support. CSRs were put in place to help compensate insurance companies for coinsurance, co-pays and deductibles that low-income consumers could not otherwise pay out on their own.\n\nBoehner, along with House leadership, felt that CSRs required an annual appropriation approved by Congress. The House argued that because Congress had never explicitly appropriated the funds for those payments, the administration’s actions were unconstitutional. After nearly two years of deliberation, Senior Judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Rosemary M. Collyer concluded the House’s claim had legal standing and allowed the case move forward on May 12, 2016.\n\nOver the course of the past 16 months, the Obama and Trump administrations have kicked the court hearing back. For those that side with Republicans, a troubling result of the appeal and numerous delays is that CSRs are still funded as they were when the Obama administration first appealed. Trump’s move Thursday essentially ends the debate, unless Congress chooses to act.\n\nOne of the glaring problems with abruptly stopping CSR payments is that it will likely lead to skyrocketing premiums for Obamacare enrollees. Roughly half of the consumers who purchase health insurance through Obamacare qualify for cost-sharing reductions\n\nConsumers are already facing double-digit premiums under Obamacare, but stopping the subsidies for insurance companies means the costs that insurers are not getting covered from the government will get transferred to the consumer.\n\nWhen insurance providers signaled they would drop out of the Obamacare market altogether in 2017, one of their primary concerns was whether or not Trump would continue paying out these subsidies.\n\nThe federal government was slated to pay out around $7 billion in CSRs in 2017. Obamacare consumers saw their out-of-pocket costs lower by over $1,000 through these subsidies.\n\nCongress could still act on the 2014 lawsuit and stymie Trump’s move. If they do not, Obamacare customers are likely to see their premiums and out-of-pocket costs soar in the future.\n\nObamacare Navigator Funding\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that many of the Obamacare programs are merely a superluous use of time and resources, including the navigator program. As such, the administration announced in September that it would cut some of the navigator program’s funding by as much as 90 percent.\n\nObamacare navigators are individuals that help consumers and businesses seek and obtain health insurance plans that meet their specific needs. They also provide outreach and educational assistance surrounding the health care marketplace.\n\nOver 70% of regional programs and 55% of statewide navigators anticipate rolling back programs in rural areas because of the administration’s funding cuts, Kaiser Family Foundation reports. The overwhelming majority, or 89 percent, of navigators expect having to fire staff because of the cuts.\n\nCuts to navigators are important in that the Obamacare marketplace can be difficult to navigate, even for an experienced consumer.\n\nThe majority of navigators, despite the cuts, plan on participating in the market in 2018.\n\nExecutive Order\n\nTrump signed an executive order Thursday that charged a number of federal agencies with finding ways to expand access to health insurance plans that are outside of Obamacare regulations. The order relaxes the rules and regulations surrounding association health plans — groups of small businesses (and possibly individuals) that join together to purchase insurance. The order would also allow these groups to purchase insurance across state lines.\n\n“With these actions … We are moving toward lower costs and more options in the health care market, and taking crucial steps toward saving the American people from the nightmare of Obamacare,” the president said Thursday.\n\n“This will direct [agencies] to take action to increase competition, increase choice, and increase access to lower-cost, high-quality health-care options,” Trump added. “This will cost the United States virtually nothing, and people will have great, great health care.”\n\nFollow Robert on Twitter\nSend tips to robert@dailycallernewsfoundation.org\n\nhttp://dailycaller.com/2017/10/13/heres-how-trump-has-silently-gutted-obamas-legacy/
Jimmy Kimmel won't touch the Harvey Weinstein story because he's not the moral conscience of America.  Right Jimmy, you're not.  America finds your ilk repulsive.  You defend sexual predators and you are a sexual predator.
Considering how big of a story this Harvey Weinstein thing is, Jimmy Kimmel took it very easy on him on this monologue.
Still waiting for some fake tears for the black on black murders in Chicago, Harvey's victims, etc....waiting for the Hollywood hypocrite.
SNAP
T
Jimminy hypocrite.
FAKE NEWS!
Love you Jimmy
lmao xD
I honestly love you!
Amateur YouTuber starting out check out my vids!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love Jimmy Kimmel 😍💚
Yet still no passionate speech about Harvey weinstein
Keep forging those tweets and you will be in jail for fraud...
The only thing funny about Kimball is his Trump obsession.
They really need to suspend Trump from using Twitter. He needs to worry about his country. Like God, Obama was so much better :/
Okay we get it, you hate trump, can we move on to some real comedy now?
fun fact: Jimmy sold his soul to satanic Hollywood, the night he succumbed to wearing a tie.
Hey Kimmel how come you don't ever start your'e monolog  without a Trump bashing .... why don't you start one with the sexual tyrants in your'e own Hollywood elite liberal community don't you think you should or do you have something to hide also? tabout Harvey Weinstein or the alleged allegations  about Oliver Stone WHY IS THAT?????
The Trumpettes are such dorks. EVERY day they cry that Jimmy hasn't addressed Harvey Weinstein ...oblivious to the fact that he addressed at the beginning of his first show after the scandal broke
Hahahaha! TRUMP Repetitive tapes are right on point!!! Thanks Jimmy K.
Jr. was defending his dad....understandable....Kimmel come on slamming a kid...that is a new low....he s a teen besides Trump didn't look great at his last signing of the Healthcare Executive Order....possible heart failure on the horizon from so much stress...I don't like him as President either but pushing a man into heart failure whom you know is extremely stressed about his image and his accomplishments is just mean along with tweeting his father s mistakes politicially....he is not his father nor shown signs yet of his father s actions and if anything children learn from their father s mistakes as well as do better in life....we are all an example of how to live or not to live....don't beat up on a child whose not responsible for his father s actions...DJ Junior is responsible for his own actions NOT his father s...really disappointed....the visciousness still going on when the decision has been made for Presidency....and I ve made mean comments but beating up on the child on social media...wow that is low.
Wake up call everyone.  This is not how a President—who is a role model (!) should act!  There should not be just one finger on the nuclear button!  I find Kimmel refreshing.  This crazy behaviour of Trump's is dangerous.  There is a group of psychiatric professionals that are starting a dialogue with members of Congress called, The Duty to Warn. They believe that Trump is dangerous to the public and as mental health professionals they have a “duty to warn” the public about what they see as Trump’s narcissism, impulsivity, poor attention span, paranoia, and other traits that, they believe, impair his ability to lead.

Ok so I remember all these things when her crew was postin these vidson insta story on summer 2017 if you remember
Human Camila is enough for me ❤️❤️❤️
Best 2:22 minutes of my life
I'm breakin' down\nGonna start from scratch\nShake it off like an etch-a-sketch\nMy lips are saying goodbye\nMy eyes are finally dry\n\nGood old days😀😀\n\nI really miss the immature, really energetic, and really cute who loves ribbons Camilla 😂😂😂😂
it needs to be a little longer....though thank you so so much camila for inspiring all the dreamers ...you are a true idol and inspiration... i love you so so so much.... i wanna meet you so badly... ilysm... my heart belongs to you and i swear it always beat million times faster whenever i hear your voice.. 😘😘😍😍💜💞🌹🙌🙌🙏🙏
JUST DO A FUCKING DOCUMENTARY, WE NEED MORE OF THIS
The dancer Justin is hot 🔥💕
did no one else see the tr*mp tower at :20 cause that shit doesn't belong here
So much fun !  They can be all friends but there is always a limit! She is their boss and they have to respect her as a boss and not as a friend... many singers go through the same stage of life that she is going... although she is having fun and she seems to be pretty cool
This reminds me of high school musical
I love her so much😧😭❤
omg this was in Atlanta. I've been to both of the places she went to, they were fun asf
She’s so down to earth and keeps it real
The happiness I felt watching this
I love her voice I love her songs !!!! She's perfect !!!!!!!!!!😍😍😍
i love you camila\nso much
I wish these videos would be longer
Every time this Havana starts in her documentary I go so emotional
I LOVE U AND I HAVE UR BACK ❤
I love this please do more camila
So thanks full to god. Thank you so much to make this angel real, she's talented,  pure, amazing, beautiful, she's a true artist because she feels what she sing every time. I love you Camila ♡
I feel like this Toshi guy and Camila might... I dont know maybe  PR??
Who tf dare to dislike this vid?!
Man vids so short but u still get so much emotion out of it 😫💕
I love how the vids are SHORT AND EXCITING!!! 😍😍
this girl really never fails to inspire me so much. first, to just reach for your dreams no matter what happens; that it is scary but you just have to do it scared. now, to never forget to live because one day you'll look back at life and it's not the riches, fame, your occupation or your degree that will matter but the memories & relationships you created. im emo. i love her. 😭
I miss her relationship with the girls of fifth harmony
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH 💜 🙈 , PERU PRESENTE Y APOYANDOTE 🌹 🙆❤❤
I felt like in a Grey's Anatomy episode lol
I love you Camz you make my life so worth living and girl I can't wait for the Havana video
i Need like at least 18315668713625868148634547164855553546761482484 Part\n*Rihanna's voice* COZ I CAN'T GET ENOUGH
I love the fact that she has such a strong bond to her family
She is look like teenager
I want a movie!!
i want to be bestfriends with camzz huhuhuhu
why i feel so sad watching this i don't have friends
I clicked cause the hoes in the thumbnail are sexy af... Oops...
why are these so short 😩
Please read this comment! The state of California has essentially legalized INTENTIONALLY infecting others with HIV via SB 239. I have created a White House Petition to call on congress to publically address SB 239 and call for its repeal! I have FaceBook group called Repeal Sb-239. If you could talk about SB-239 and address this issue and call for people to sign the petition it would be a great help. I am paying to promote a vid on my channel that talks about this because it sets a dangerous precedence! Please help! I need 100,000 signatures within 30 days. We could do something good!

Havana music video
that chick had THE WORST golf swing i've ever seen in my life.
So mila talked about how she felt when she is surrounded by those people and she said how much she loves them but...did she not have the same feelings in 5H? Did she not feel as if the girls had her back? Did she not feel as if they loved her? And b-4 yall talk...i like queen mila and yes shes not in 5H ik... it was just a thought 😙😙
Lindos Kane Brown & Katelyn Jae ❤️😍

❤ Kane! This song is 🔥
I love everything he sings my #1 favorite...
I fuck with his music hard 🔥
I love this song to death
xD xD xD I love how this is supposed to be old fashioned, but in the first few minutes we see a rather modern phone. #plotholes
Love this song 😍😍i want this 😭
Kane brown I love you my name is landon
I love this so much!!!😍😭💕👏
This is such a beautiful song and video. You can just see the happiness on their faces , love it
ANITTA IS IN #12 USA with the Song IS THAT FOR ME(ALESSO FEAT.ANITTA)!UP!!!
I know every time song of his
Must admit, if just one person reads this it will make my day. I'm a music artist from Azerbaijan (I guess you even don't know where this country is). I do know that folks always make these comments, but I believe that I will be the one you'll be excited you decided to listen to. If ONE PERSON could just give this a thumbs up, you will be a great step closer to helping a person's dreams come true. I swear that I don't suck and you won't be disappointed. I Just need one chance and 3 minutes.
🎶What's Mine Is Yours 🎶.\n\nLovely song \nKane Brown is so talented 😊.
Another brilliant song never seems to dissapoint
Well I love it.  Kane Brown is a new person to me.  Love his style and his music.  Hope he goes far and stays popular for years to come.  This song is just wonderful.
SO GAY! lol jk congrats!
Nigga is overrated
Yous a pussy an a trick
50... *TRENDING* WOOAHHHH now gonna watch bill bye feminist guy
Pretty gay tbh
Listen to this at 1.25 speed. You'll thank me later :)
Amazing I want to make a video like this with someone !!!
Why am i here
Is it wrong that as soon as I saw VEVO in the thumbnail I thought it was another diss track?
This little faggot needs to be raped
i thought it will be communism song by the title
That smile. That blink of your eyes that made me change my ways. You freed this man from all his rusted chains and changed everything I ever knew. You blew away all the walls I  could ever place before your feet. You took this heart I buried 6ft deep from all to see and made it believe it's fine to be alive and thrive in the light of the day that you gave me. You saved me, and for that what's mine is yours...
So is so stupid and boring from a kid
i hate fukin country its like IM A COWBOY
it’s good but too much like eminem
I was hoping this would be that one song from All Dogs Go To Heaven...
What kinda gay ass shit is this kane, common bro.
THE ONLY KANE I WANNA HEAR IS BIG DADDY KANE MOTHAFUCKA!
Gonna be honest- only reason I clicked was bcuz I thought I said Kanye West...
Made me cry😭 Not sure if I'm crying coz they super cute and so happy or coz I'm a bit jealous.\nIf anyone tries to break them up they'll have to deal with me❤❤ they so cute man.
got that shakira nasal sound..nice....urrhhnnnaa
I love your new song and I hadn't fiancee liten to it we both noticed your love story and ours have a lot of simularity if you Dont mind I'd love to play it at our wedding . and thank you I love your music ...😄
Who shoots on VHS anymore?
White woman love a half nigger. Disgrace to your own race
The chorus tune is copied from If I die Young by the band perry and also Eminem
you wanna be quite precise so 8,9 or 10 minutes
Can we make a Swiss roll with a giant raisin on top?
It has to be nice to have so few allergies in one's circle of acquaintances that dairy free poses a problem. I once made a birthday cake that was nut free, egg free, gluten free, chocolate free, berry free,  stone fruit free and that did not contain lactose, in order to accommodate all the allergies and intolerances within the party-goers. Wasn't the BEST thing I've ever baked, but 1000% worth the effort to see everyone's delight when told that No, there's no gluten/nuts/eggs/etc in there, so you can eat it.
Why is someone who is dairy free an idiot?

Is vanilla paste different from vanilla extract?
Now technically... none of us should suck the tit of another animal into adulthood (or ever).
I live in Switzerland but never ate that
Hiya guys love your channel. Would you be able to make baba ganoush at some point? I love it and would really like to see your version. It's good as a dip but I love it with spicy roast lamb too thanks 😉
every time i watch this channel i get so hungry and want to eat what they made
Have you guys ever tasted woodruff before? (or in german Waldmeister) If not you have to try it its a unique taste that i never found somewhere else.\nI also would like to see you come up with a recipe for it.
in Chile we call that brazo de reina, which means queen's arm
Any chance of you guys making Wagamamas Firecracker Chicken one day?
Yep, I'm gonna hold off for another five seconds cause I always end a little... too... early. Oh, look look look, nearly nearly nearly. Nuts are going in!
Thank you for the dairy free recipe
Where on earth do you find hazelnut milk!!!?!?!!
my name is Jeremy But no girlfriend hard r i p.
You're knocking off my nuts ;)
You come for the recipes - you stay for the puns
“And then you wanna grab yourself (long pause) a tray lined with paper.” 😂
JEREMY YOU IDIOT i died
Stoked to see your flavour choice!  Hazelnut and coffee is one of my absolute favourite combos. Thanks for the shout out :)
Love how he explains the reason for each ingredient/action!
Did anyone notice the head-wiggle Ben always does while or after saying sorted?
Any suggestions if you can't have eggs or dairy? 😥😥😥 I've the worst allergies :(
I’m Jeremy’s girlfriend literally
Huh that's how I roll my joints 🤔
Mike, you can totally be Jeremy’s girlfriend if you want to. You can be anything you want if you believe hard enough.
Keep up the dairy free desserts/ food! 👌
What? didn't understand girlfriend explanation >.<
I love the intro it's so funny
Is it possible to substitute hazelnut with macadamia?
Please temper your hazelnut coffee mixture or you will scramble the yolk
What if you can't find hazelnut milk? Will other nut mills work??
u're knocking off my nuts\n\nthat sounded damn wrong man XD
You're knocking off my nuts\n\nMike, 2017
Dairy free recipe but you used eggs......
Mike just wanted to put his nuts all over that roll but Ben kept getting in the way
But I’m a girl and I can’t eat dairy
Wait it says coffee st the start and hazelnut in the title
“let me guess, someone stole your sweet roll”
Love the video, but I'm allergic to hazelnuts :(
Very nice, thanks for sharing!
i must try this, thank you.
Hey Mike, you are acting a little strange lately, are you alright?\nBlink twice on the next video if you need help!
Ben almost said Dairy Free Girlfriend at the end don't even try and hide it lad
You can make this vegan by replacing the egg yolks in the cream with silken tofu and the eggs in the cake with aqua faba for the volume and oil for the fat!
Mike''s looking better than eva... so YUMMAYY :)
Ben wins for the first minute with that nose pinch over the glasses...
You're knocking off my nuts \n-Micheal
Could I replace the coffee with something else? Dairy free but I can't stand the taste of coffee..
If he waited until cake was cooled off a little I don't think it would've stuck to the parchment. Can't always cover bad bits with powdered sugar
Oh my god, that looks soo good... I wanna have it!
oh my god Mike don't ignore it >:C
Looking for Jermi in the commnets ;)
That looks yummy even for people who can eat dairy.
I've already become obese watching this. Eating it will kill me for sure.
Swiss rolls are awesome and super tasty so it's awesome that you made a video with this recipe, but you can tell that it's def not perfect. Swiss rolls should be round and the spiral should stand out well otherwise the cake part might not have been made right which is totes fine for just eating with family, but you want to impress your mates right? ;)
Wow it is on trending!
aw man i *just* used the hazelnut milk i had sitting around to make a faux alfredo to get rid of it.
The best things about dairy-free and/or vegan recipes is that those can be enjoyed by everyone in the family together!
Hmm...reading a comment I had an idea.  These things rarely escape so I hope this is a good one.  Here goes...How about an education week?  Teaching a class or feeding the 5000 in a dinner school or students restaurant.  Best foods for learning etc.  I'm sure that students will love it.  Well, how did I do?  Oh...OK.   Sorry, I think I'll just go off and disappear.
 You're knocking off my nuts \n*Ben giggles silently*
I'm sorry but you know Mary Berry would say that the roll is not tight enough!!
Looking good, Mike! Lots of jaw line definition!
Which is the better method for making marshmallows using egg whites or without egg whites?
I understand how weird this is going to sound, but I'm gonna say it anyway.\nWatching Ben roll that pastry was like, oddly sexual? Just me? 🤷
Looks a bit like it's filled with cold pork gravy... So my challenge for you is this: Make a savory pork swiss roll with gravy!

nothing like a mild, unnecessary transphobic comment when you're trying to watch a recipe video, thanks so much Ben
so cute i really love this look!!!!!!!
Love this! 💜💜💜
Pls do so more halloween videos!
I love it 😍
Can we see jonye does my Halloween makeup?? 😏
You don't have to create Halloween looks just because all the other YouTube people do it. Not everyone celebrates it lol
I really love this glam skull. So pretty!! <3
I love this look so much! I think it would've looked awesome with some color brows!
Gorgeous babe! SO GLAM and pretty <3 LOVEEEEE!
I am going to try to recreate this look! I love that it's still really pretty and girly! I'm going to use rhinestones for teeth though! 😁 Great tutorial girl 💕
Dayummmmm
This is sooooo pretty
You're the best :) skull <3\n\nIG my_insta_soul  :) come in <3
so pretty!!! xo from my channel to your’s <3
OK I just tried doing this and it came out that I was a donkey? Yea I'm not good at doing makeup
I’m gonna have to do something similar to this! I got a glow in the dark skeleton t shirt to take the boy trick or treating
So cool:)
Katy I love youuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Lowkey, when I saw the cover I thought it was Sandra Bullock and I almost cried bc I love Sandra Bullock more than life.
How You Make A Skull Look Sexy & Colorful 😩🔥🔥🔥
You need to start a face chart series where you do a series of a bunch of face charts you like ❤️❤️😭😭😍😍 love you girl
The coverfx drops don' t play well with any makeup underneath.
Katy your skin looks extra bomb!! Did you add something new to your skincare routine?? Love you btw and love this look! ❤️❤️
Do any of you ladies know when the restock of the DesixKaty collection is ??😭😭
I love how people talk shit and then say “no shade”. Excuse me but you’re just being a bitch NO SHADE gtfo
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Katy have you ever had that mole on the left side of your chest checked out? asking bc u my girl
Great work! Funny how you look like you have a permanent frown 😅
your lips make me want to eat powdered donuts 🤔
U look like Kim K with that blonde hair! 😳 Love this Katy!!! 😍😍😍
I love when you do colorful and creative looks! They just look sooo bomb on you. 🙌🏽💕💜Like your face charts omg I dieeee, keep it coming @Katy! 💗💖
What you said was holo was NOT holo smfh
Ok I love this n all, but is it weird that I like you and Desi's hands? Like weirdest comment ever js tho🤣🤣 like the hands have posture haha
i don't get the dots on you forehead?
Can you do a fortune teller Halloween look
What other holosexuals got trigger when she said holo when there’s no holo on her look?
I'd like to skull fuck this girl.
I thought to myself I can do this, lets check the video out.  After watching a bit,  I would definitely never ever be able to do this. Very cool!
You look like Kim Kardashian in the thumbnail.
I love it, but I really love the eyes. I'm going to wear the eyes as an everyday look lol
You should have done your neck as well! 😊
How is this video advertiser friendly? I thought your immense beauty would trigger some kind of a red flag.💕
How do you look look gorgeous with every hair colour 💁🏻❤️
This is how you do a pretty skull look for Halloween without appropriating another culture.  Love it!
So dope K A T Y 💜💕
Girrrrrrl how is this even easy, it would take me a thousand hours and would come nowhere near as good as yours lol.
you look like Kim K with the wig on.
Am I the only one that think she looks like Kim kardashian???
Dam! I feel so inspired now! Thanks Katy!
Love it purple is my fav!! 💜
Can't wait to recreate this 😘😘😘
I think this look would have looked a bit better if the contour section were a bit more anatomically correct.  You put too much of the pink on your cheecks when it should have been lighter in the front and darker(more pink) towards the hollows. Overall you did a great job Katy. Practice makes perfect.
I love the eye makeup so fucking much
Barbie 💕💜💕💀 I love this
GIRL!!...IF YOU DONT BRING BACK THE MALFOY HAIR!!!😤
Living, breathing, dying for this look yassss

Currently in the ER slowly dying, I want my skeleton to look like this so I had to watch 🤷🏻‍♀️😂
This looks very similar to Sylvia gani's glitter glam skull just with little to no glitter in this video

Carrie & Lowell Part 2: Electric Boogaloo
this is literally just a sonic fusion of age of adz and carrie and lowell lol
Wallowa Lake Monster debuted at #8 on the New Alternative 40 Chart this week:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwo_Ucs-wc4&list=PLxlSBzMcrtkMCVtuXEIz5BXpPfycTwsS5&index=8
Subaru Sedans is at it again.\ni can bet he is not using *A U T H E N T I C VIEWS D O T C O M* to get views \nas he is talented
a 10 minute edit of the outro \npls
The lyrics of this song make me think of a family losing their mother to alcoholism. Additionally, it is sung very beautifully.
I NEED A MYSTERY OF LOVE!!!!
The beauty of this song makes up for my disappointment that the new release is not Mystery of Love
I'm from Wallowa lake and the lake monster is actually a real urban myth from the Nez Perce Tribe I was told growing up:) this makes me so happy.
This is hypnotic. Just gorgeous.
His voice whispering those beautiful words into my ears in the darkness of my bedroom with that music! Holding my tears (sad/joyful) until he says no oblation will bring her back to our place. God bless you Sufjan!
Stunned by the beauty of this song
when i am listening one of the sufjan's songs i feel like i am the most depressed person on all world.and i dont know why but i love that feeling
when i first saw the song's title, i really thought it would be a single for the Oregon album
new music!? yessss i'm in tears
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH
Spathiphyllum, cedar waxwing, and charybdis all in one song about a mother. This may be my favorite of Carrie and Lowell. \nHear me, my chiefs. I am tired. My heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more, forever.\n-Chief Joseph of the Wallowa
fuck you this is depressing as fuck
Oh! Miss Sufjan, you shouldn't have!
the beginning is like a softer version of weird fishes
My heart is about to break again
is he gonna release more music soon?
More of Carrie and Lowell is always welcome
Between God and mortals, there is Sufjan Stevens. Pure magic.
The brass and strings in this song sound similar to those in some parts planetarium
This song is intrinsic af! But you can't tell me he didn't pull from his Should've Known Better progression on the first phrasings of the first verse
Subaru Stevens back on his shit
I was just at Wallowa Lake last weekend! Beautiful place.
Sufjan been listening to some BOC
Woah... Haven't gotten these Age of Adz vibes in a long time... But seamlessly blended with with Carrie and Lowell magic.
The 3-minute outro is bringing me to fucking tears. Greatest artist alive, without a doubt.
Yo this is depressing as shit.
omg this was exactly what I needed, bless u Sufjan
more proof that carrie & lowell could've been his oregon album
what a beautiful slow drift of an ending
This is what genius sounds like.
First 10 seconds sound a lot like Everybody Wants To Rule The World
Heard this yesterday, for the first time. Thanks Gorilla vs. Bear! So beautiful!
Sounds like something exactly between C&L and Planetarium. Bless him.
the second half straight up beat me up, this is so good
I don't know how he managed to make me cry with all his songs.
Holy shit this is beautiful, can't wait!!!
I never clicked a video so fast and I was not disappointed
i thought it was mystery of love...this is better
This guy is a genius
is this a nylon banjo?
It's hard to believe that I've loved Sufjan for 12 years now.
Thank you thank you so much for releasing it on my birthday ❤
Man I used to swim in wallowa lake all the time as a kid.
Been a fan since time began. Keep inspiring creative genius!
monsters showing their face = 2017
just heard this today on the radio tripped me out hard core
Had a crappy day. This made it better
*this is wine to my ears - both bitter and sweet at the same time*
Thank you, yet again Sufjan, for saving my life
Sufjan I would do anything for you
Surfism Stovens is the musician of the century.
2:13 I melt
Gawd I love him
Boy, another goosebumps attack, just like the first time I heard the entire Carrie & Lowell album :')
1:54 AAAAAAAHHHHHH I LOVE YOU SUBARU

Amazing!! So inspiring Suf!!!!

‘Trending’
Thank you
beauuuuutiful!
I fucking love you Sufjan❤❤
Exquisite Sufjan. I love you.
The Greatest Gift is Sufjan Stevens himself. An angel in our midst, singing to God for all of us.
this song is like half carrie and lowell, half age of adz
not much moved me to tears but blue bucket of gold live.  until this... and now it all makes me cry.  in a good way\n...I think.  well it's beautiful isn't it.
Sufjan, it's hard to tell if you're a better poet or a musician. Absolutely incomparable genius
this is where sufjan is at his best ... stripped back, folk-y, vulnerable. love it.
You are the Bob Dylan of our generation.
Sufjan Stevens is my favorite musician because he is artsy
18 days left.
In 1885, a prospector, who wished to keep his identity a secret, was about midway across the lake when he saw an animal about fifty yards to the right of his boat. The animal reared its head and neck out of the water about 10 feet, paused, then quickly dove back into the water.
Please make mint oreo and merangue chocolate cake
Same thing here in Canada. It is getting really cold here. But I will still eat popsicles in the dead of winter because I don't care! Btw these look so good!
Hii Jemma can u plzz shows us some more biscuits or something like biscuit rolls or some cake dessert 😋🤗 tht would be great thnxx
omg u can just freeze yogurt! JUST LIKE THAT!! my god, I surely wasted my life till now..... and of course u can wrap the popsicles once they are frozen!!!!!!! 😭😭😭😂 thanks for saving my wasted life TWICE, surely am making this one!!! ❤️
I’m just here drooling over her recipes cause I’m too lazy to make them 😂
I want to study abroad next year in London so if i do go, Im defiantly going to  Crumbs & Doilies!
They look gorgeous 😍
Nice😍
Aw, you posted this about half an hour after my girls begged to watch a video of yours before going to bed. (We found an old one they hadn't seen yet.) They're 6 & 4 and love cake videos, yours especially.
Please make more cakes!!!!
That paper wrapping gave me asmr
My d
I love your cooking!!It's awesome and delicious. I LOVE YOU!!^^♡♡♡♡
Was anyone else worrying about her pretty white shirt getting purple stains from the blueberries? 😮😅 x
Jemma, your videos are so helpfull and Tasty 😋 💖💖
Do MACARONS! :)
Love this idea!!
These are your popsicles! ( beats the wisk ) 😂😂😂
Yummy 😋😋😋 Kisses from my channel 💕😘😘😘💕
Yogurt is gross
Hello Jemma, could you please make Raffaello cupcakes? :) x
I'm sorry I love Jemma but who bites and chews and ice lolly
mmm yummy! thanks for sharing the recipe, jemma! ♡
#YUM
Jemma you have nice hair
my mouth watering
this*
First
Look really good....
soo nice!!!!
Do these not cristallize? Every time I try freezing yogurt, it always creates small ice crystals that make it horrible to eat. How do I avoid that?
Can you do this with coconut?
Yuuuuummmmmmmmmyyyyyyyy
I'm glad u made this,in Florida it's still in the mid 80 degrees outside and I really need something to cool down!
Thank you Jemma!!! ❤️❤️❤️ it's always summer in Singapore here 😂 so thank you for this recipe
Heyy I really love watching you \nCan you show us how to make hot cookie dough pleaseee\nThanks x
Please made a biscoff cake:) They looks so good.
RIP blueberry at 0:30
Please show us how to make the cookies and cream oreo cake!
I love your shirt! It looks like vanilla cream or pudding with the seeds scattered throughout!
I love your videos. Even though summer is over it's still a good idea to make those. I have a nephew who is a year old and he is currently teething. He is in allot of pain and cold things such as ice lollies helps to sooth his gums and mouth. I might have to try your recipes for my nephew.
Where can you get those icecream molds. Gotta have them.
Thanks for the recipe. Love you jemma.I live in Thailand l like watching you make a lot of sweets.
Those look delish!  And, you really did only use 4 ingredients!  Nice job Jemma!!
Will you be attempting chocolate macarons at some point? (Not macaroons) they are tricky to get right but I think you will get there. You could even do them as part of a cupcake or something. Like the oreo cupcakes but with chocolate macarons. Anyway, keep up the good work. The snickers brownie and Portuguese custard tarts videos are my favourites.
Yes for me it's sunny, i am living in Caribbean !!! And cold what does it mean ?? 😄, i try your loly pop tomorrow , thank you, i send you peace of SUN 🌞🌞🌞
This should not be trending
Yogurt.\nyogurt.\n_yogurt_\n*yogurt*\n\nsorry,you yog *hurt* my feelings with that spelling.
Made me cringe watching you BITE the popsicle... Besides that, thank you, I'm going to try and make this!!
thank you so much! I'm just trying to eat quite a bit healthier here in Hawaii, so it was nice to see this recipe to know that I don't necessarily have to give up a monthly dessert. Thanks again very excited to try this!
yup! it is always summer here in Singapore!
Does anyone know what the US conversions are??? TIA
How about some more/ new Halloween recipes? Are you going to have a Halloween skit this year?
Nice video I'll make those when I  have a party or friends gathering
OMG 😙😙Jemma you did amazing with the popsicle and with every dessert💓💯 I can not wait to be like you and meet you someday you 😍inspire me to do what I do best and that is to bake🎂🍦🍩
Omg these look AMAZING!! Also I really like the look of your kitchen Jemma! I have just started a baking channel myself and would love it if anyone could check it out and say hello😌
I love the way you read our minds ( e.g.  can add or less sugar, use other fruit...) you answer our questions b4 we ask them. Lol
yummm and its so hot here in south america :p
Roseburg Oregon was 45 degrees this morning it's only about 51 degrees now I'm not happy with the cold weather already LOL I miss summer went warmer fall weather
Cupcake jemma it's my birthday on Sunday the 15th.

Hello sweetie.  I love all your videos, and I don't comment usually because I can't eat most of what you make because I don't like the flavor of butter or sugar.  I know, I'm really weird.  Anyway, thank you for this recipe because I would have never thought to make these!
Made your Oreo cupcakes for a bake sale today :) they were delicious (if I do say so myself) but all down to the perfect recipe!
I noticed the bird tattoo and the one on the towel @ 00:35. Then i realized that it was a cupcake jemma towel. Plz tell us more

She does what so many before her couldn't do.  Evolve and get better.
*MIR-AGE'* , (me-räzhe',) n.

It is missing some of the first pages. The latest date I have found in it was a 1900 population census.
I Love the way the violin. I have hear many from orchestra and country songs. But you bring out my emotions to a level that it is
Insanely good! Wow. I've never heard this style of music before, this really is something fresh and new!
lindsey you should do a colab with the 'americas got talent' duo 'nuttin but stringz'...??
I LLLLOOOOOVVVVVEEEEEE your music your my fav youtuber 🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶🎶🎵🎶🎶 ps this is not jodi I'm her son I want to be able to play as good as you maybe even better someday
AMAZING, LINDSEY ❤️❤️ YOU'RE THE BEST
You always made my day ❤️
Really liked the video, but why put these annoying black bars? Why not record it in 16/9 aspect ratio?
Another amazing piece as always, venturing into new styles and genres fantastic can't wait to see what's next. Just beautiful loved it. Just beautiful movement
*I love the beginning!*
Everyone says the music is beautiful. I think she looks beautiful! Lindsey has talent and beauty! <3
I was kinda iffy on this one but when I watch it the second time I enjoyed so much more. If you do see this could you do a League of legends one, you could pick any champions music...I personally prefer Sonas but if you can't that's all right. Keep up the good work! Love the new winter cover and music something fresh with Christmas music instead of the same old same old.
Lindsey! I'm going to your concert on dec.11!!!
I love that she used a different style
We love it so much:)))
how's possible that 1k people dislike this song?!?!  This song is amazing!!!
Hi Lindsey, I love your music, and one of my other fav channels just made a really funny video about you!  Don't worry nothing mean about you is in it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_2742807005&feature=iv&index=3&list=PLGVpxD1HlmJ89Kmt-ZRih478uaXaOFKu7&src_vid=WmdjSWGfK9U&v=9omhrI0Pnq8
Goddess of the violin
This actually reminded me of Aladdin somehow from Disney and a mix of goddesses. Great music video Lindsey
When she was covered in gold she reminded me of Jadis, the ice witch from Narnia
Hi Lindsey! I have been listening to your music since.....well I guess Freshman Year if High School I believe. Well Anyway, I've listened to most of your videos and I must admit you have evolved so much in your art, the dancing , costumes, the meaning of each video you show the world, everything I've been hearing lately is so amazing I cant express how much I love it! Don't listen to what others are saying on these comments about you being a 'sell out', they dont see good talent like they used to these days dont they? Me personally havent seen any of what they claim to be true, all I see is a musician doing her art with all the love and confidence very few can match! I wish you the best of luck on Dancing with the Stars and hope you win!
Ya think she ever sleeps in ?
Ok good music but why is indian kathak music in a middle east inspired video. Its almost like you dont understand what youre taking things from like youre just going oh that sounds exotic and eastern lets just put that in shall we
Wow that video was so amazing!
You are so amazing!! I love your creations! Your talent is a real tresure in this world! Congratulations!!! 😍👌🏻👏🏻
Yea,  well I can Peel a whole orange in one go. Lol
How she can dance, paly the volin and sing 😱😱😱
elements was the best..  can't go wrong with fire lol
this reminds me of the sovereigns
I'm a beginner cello player, i hope to one day be as good at the cello as you are at violin :D You're an inspiration to many people Lindsey <3
Good job on dancing with the stars lindsey your dance was awesome  you got a 28 keep up the good work I know you will win this year!!!!!!!💃💃
Am I the only one who liked the older music videos more?
It's too cute! Love Lindsey <3 <3 <3
can I be in your next vid?
Lindsey is an amazing artist!!
I'm going to see her in cerder rapids Iowa this desember I can't wait
My goodness, so elegant. And the speed of that plucking! I'm truly impressed, you are very talented Lindsey. Through your art you've earned my respect.
why is there like so little acknowledgment of raja kumari here? I love lindsey but raja kumari is extremely talented and deserves the recognition and not to mention, for an indian song with influences of bollywood and bharatnatyam, there is literally no representation from a single indian person in this video
Can't believe you have added indian music into this and it has come out amazing....
This is my favorite song off the Brave album!
You are amazing in everything you do 💕
Blonde hair, violin, creativity... Miyazono Kaori I miss you T^T \nLove you Lindsey, keep living  <3 I don't break my kokoro to break twice over violin T^T
I've been wanting a video for this song ever since I first heard it on her album. This is so much more than what I was expecting and It's wonderful! I may or may not have played this on repeat for the past week....
I could not take my eyes away. I love all the work you do and how much dedication you put into doing what you love but remember that too much of a good thing can be dangerous. Remember to take care of yourself please! Stay awesome!
This girl is a Genius.. !
At the end of the video I can see her ribs! I hope you're doing ok Ms. Stirling.
For those crying cultural appropriation in the comments:\n\nThe proper definition of cultural appropriation is claiming a culture of which you're not a part to be your own. I'll use myself as an example. I'm German, so I celebrate German culture. If someone who isn't German likes the culture and decides to partake in something like, let's say, Oktoberfest, but doesn't claim that s/he is German, I have no problem with that. But if that same person claims to be German, when in fact, s/he is Portuguese, then that would start rustling my jimmies.\n\nNow, I know some might say, But you're European. You did that all the time and still do that. I'll include a better example. I play the didgeridoo, an instrument played by Australian Aborigines. I'm not claiming to be Aboriginal, I just appreciate the didgeridoo for what it is. But if I was claiming to be Aboriginal, that would make me a jerk. And nobody likes a jerk.\n\nIf anything, what Lindsey's doing here is cultural appreciation. She's not claiming to be Indian, she's drawing inspiration from Hindu culture for this song/video. If all of her songs were like this, then yeah. That'd be offensive. But this is one song off of one of three albums. \n\nSo please. Chill out. Have some popcorn. Just calm down.
You could put her in a trashbag and it would be a absolute fabules trashbag.
This one's got some awesome beats to it! And I also love the costume design, and the mix of browns and blacks and a hint of gold (I think there's a hint of gold in there... somewhere...), it makes this vid look and feel somewhat Egyptian yet modern too! And by the way, I have no idea what I'm talking about too lol
is this for diwali, if so, GR8 JOB
Loved this video!   And we are loving watching you on Dancing With the Stars!  You have done such a great job!!!   Mark is the perfect partner for you.  I love that he is so creative just like you!
This music is incredible, you've used Indian music so well
Lindsey Stirling: Achieving what most think is impossible.
Absolutely beautiful!   You touch my soul with your gypsy music.   Asha!!!
Exotic
Every time I drop my phone on my face
oh boy i would like to smash them'all
we love you Lindsey!!! Voting for you every week on DWTS!!!! You are beautiful inside and out! Such an inspiration!
You did it again!  Love it love.
I love your music Lindsey: Kisses from Spain
It's great and very exiting😍
Since when did Jenna Marbles start playing the violin?
Dang! The speed at which she's plucking?!!! Just…HOW!?!?!!???
In what language is it sung?
I love that song so much , i am so excited for warmer in the winter :)  , Lindsey please we want to see Phelba at dancing with the stars in backstage for looking you :D
The video clip is perfect bravo  ...but....you make more beautiful music from that...

2:30 ... you saw Guardians of the Galaxy 2 !!!!
I've heard rumor of a study done on different audio formats and the emotional effects on the brain. Have you heard anything of this study? I've tried to find it... but then again i haven't looked too hard. lol.\n\nthanks!
Hi Rick. I too went to audio engineering school around 2004. We were extremely fortunate to have Mr. Rupert Neve come and give us a presentation specifically on sound quality. The short version is they studied brain activity (PET scan I think) as a person listed to the same song from record, CD and mp3. The results were very interesting. Records showed the highest brain activity followed by CD and mp3. In fact as the quality decreased, parts of the brain that fire when you are irritated stared to show up. The thought is the human ear can't hear above roughly 20K so CDs have a brick wall filter at 22.5k and MP3s do something similar. My understanding is records go all the way up to 96 k. They determined that although we can't hear the extra frequencies, they think our brain perceives them and knows they are there. The brain kind of fills in the blanks so to speak. When those frequencies were removed, irritation part of the brain started showing more and more activity. Just thought it was kind of relevant to the topic.
So Katy Perry's and Coldplay's production quality is crap? \n\nEDIT: Okay so now in the middle of the vid, different hypothesis. Maybe because the two employed big time producers, who can't hear those high pitches so it wasn't in consideration.
In my opinion this is very subjective. Just as compression used in mixing can be bad or good bit rate and and depth can also be. Even 8 bit files can sound better than 16 bit in certain cases. So, my philosophy is always go with the highest bit rate and depth reasonably possible. Rendering down is easy but rendering up is not techinaly possible. \n\nI took the test myself. I chose the uncompressed more often but even after knowing the bit rate my opinion did not change. That last song she did DID sound better at a lower rate in my opinion. Could even be the engineer mixed it so that it would sound better with mp3 compression. Actually, in fact that is something I've heard engineers discuss.\n\nOh and another point is that people do sample music from albums (obviously) and therefore will prefer a lossless format.
Please prepare better. You completely missed what is MP3. tha algorithm works different way than you said. the difference is audible. it just depends on yourr hearing and the hardware and the most important is the sound - the record You use. there is no reason to use MP3 today when disk space is cheap and internet is fast enough. MP3 should be forgotten.
Your evidence is presented on Youtube, with its lossy audio compression not taken into account.\nWhat a waste of bandwidth!\nI'm just pleased that I haven't wasted any time listening to it :)
Uuugh - F*ck - The Yamaha NS10 is an industry standard because it has fast timing and sound awful - If it sounds good on them then it sounds good on anything, thats the f*cking point of them. You should know that at your age.
My biggest issue w/ lower rate MP3s is that many songs end up w/ some weird phasing artifacts in the high end (cymbals, etc.) when listening through headphones or close spaced monitors.  Once the bit rate is above 192-256Kbps, most of those artifacts become less noticeable.
You may find Andy Clark's work in predictive coding (perception is a controlled hallucination) as a model from neuroscience applied to this discussion.   There are papers on the web.   Still reading the Sapolsky book here and arranging a new song before bringing in the guys (yeah, luvs my Guitare Pro) so haven't dug deep into Clark yet.   Still his ideas about priors and top down organization for predictive coding accord with other work .   Have a look in your copious spare time.\n\nRecommended your album to David Crosby this AM when he asked on his FB page about music to listen to on Music Monday.   Dunno if he took up the recommendation but being a lover of advanced harmony, he might.   Looked at the album on your page.  You named each piece for the scales?   Now THAT is academia, Dude.   Neat though.  Cheers.
Rudy Van Gelder, the great jazz recording engineer, recorded great albums well into his 80s.
Thanks for your honesty on this. I consider myself to have a pretty good ear, and I'd concede that in the realm of digital audio, there's a certain threshold re: the sample rate where once you get above that threshold, any difference I hear is likely psychosomatic. I contend that I can often hear the difference between a 128 and a 320 mp3, but even then it largely depends on the music itself and what kind of audio information it contains. Something with a lot of splashy or crispy cymbals, for example, can suffer from compression artifacts at 128.
HI Rick\n\nFirst time commenting on one of your videos.  Thanks for this.  I know there are a lot of people that don't understand that the quality of digital encoding is what is most important.  Yes, to most people listening to a 320K mp3 will be indistinguishable from a wav or flac encoding of the same source.\n\nMy personal preference is to go with flac files, not because of any audiophile bs, but because I can hear minor differences depending on the original source.  I bring up this as a point because it is interesting.  I took that NPR test when it came out and got 5 out of 6 correct. I can't remember if it was Katy Perry or Coldplay I got wrong, but it was one of those two.\n\nThe thing that I found most interesting was that the recordings that were definitely analog sources (Perahia and Neil Young) were actually easy to tell the difference.  The ones that were digital sources (Coldplay, Katy Perry) were more difficult...  And I was left wondering how many of the factors around the differences. (IE, digital vs analog source recording, time periods during which the recordings were made, and differences in studio recording and mastering techniques).\n\nThe Suzanne Vega track is an interesting one, which I would have thought most people would get wrong, given it's role as a model in the development of the MP3. And yet, many people seem to be able to tell the difference with that track.
Awesome video Rick.   Words could not be more true.  People who get on with this BS drive me crazy.  But I understand why it happens.  What soneone hears is completely biases based on what they know or see regarding the source in question.  In Mix With The Masters JJP said how much 24.44.1 sounds MUCH  better than 24.48 and he can tell the difference every time.   I literally laughed out loud.  I believe that he actually believes this is true.  BUT...in a blind test I would bet my life he or anyone else could ever tell.  Most of these people also spend most of their time talking about music and gear rather than making it as well.\n\nAnyways.  Great video as alwsys.  There internet needs more videos like this to combat all the silliness and misinformation.
I think 66% is pretty good, I’m impressed.\nIt looks like definitely she can hear a difference. Some tracks can even sound “more pleasant” to the ear when compressed, think of a filtered picture. So the fact that she didn’t guess right doesn’t mean that she couldn’t tell the difference
I prefer lossless / FLAC..I absolutely can tell the diff but only because I’m a guitar player & hobbyist producer
You and Scott Grove ( Groovy Music Lessons) should get together and do a show. I imagine it like Car Talk on NPR.
I record at 96kHz so all the frequencies I can't hear can be used to annoy cats and dogs. I record at 24bit so that uncompressed, Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture will immediately cause tinnitus. Problem?
dude, the difference between 128 and wave, heard on a PA, is absolutely massive. don't believe me? go try it.
It's interesting that the two that she got wrong are modern, digital, height-of-the-loudness-war tracks, while 3/4 of the ones she got right are pre-2000, originally-recorded-on-tape songs. Including, of course, Tom's Diner, which was the standard that Brandenburg used to create the mp3 format. I'd even guess that the mastering on Dark Horse and Speed of Sound were specifically designed to sound ~perfect~ all the way down to 128kbps, while the Neil Young, Murray Perahia and Suzanne Vega tracks would have been mastered within the limitations of the analogue domain and suffered as a result of increasing levels of file compression after being digitised later on.
Rick putting things in perspective. People can get lost in all the numbers and technical info, which is important and if you work with audio it's info you have to know, but it should not get in the way of what really matters which is Does it sound good? Is the sound coming out of the speakers/earphones making me FEEL something?. Great vid Rick!
I am one of those people with golden ears. It's not all that great though: They weigh more than my head, and I can hear F*** all. On the plus side, I don't have to worry about corrosion and they look cool.
Why bother with lossy compression ( a flac is around 30 megabytes) when you can get a 400 gb microsd card? Just makes absolutely no sense to use those any longer.
Just an observation about your use of terminology: 44.1Khz is a sample rate whilst 320 kbp/s is a bitrate: the two things are different and not mutually exclusive. The latter will usually (although not exclusively) also be 44.1 kHz. Apologies if anyone else has already made this point, but there were 578 other comments at the time of writing....
Thanks, that was really insightful - could you also cover the other formats and what their purpose is? MP3/ACC/OGG
I think its all about the mood created, example: I don't like Jazz or Trumpet players,.. BUT!!! every time I listen to a MILES DAVIS recording,... I get blown away,... something he was able to do with music (tones, frequency's, timing, meters, dissonance, silence, quiet sounds, loud sounds,... ect.) is just mind blowing to me.
There's always going to be a difference between an mp3 and a .wav. To say otherwise would be to lie to yourself. You can't fool nature's law. \n\nHowever, as to which one sounds better is all in the ear of the beholder. I personally like the YouTube version of Meshuggah's Rational Gaze better than right off the album.\n\nSue me.
I dont believe many people could tell the difference between 44.1k and 96k after mastering but definately MP3 especially on a large system with big subwoofers and extended highs. I have found most headphones arent the same in this sense for some reason.
All I know is this: there is something where I hear the instruments very clearly defined, not a one lump of sounds, and in digital world this mostly happens when I listen to 24/96 music.
So true story. But on the compression artefacts on mp3, doesn't that require a different skillset when to isolate those when listening? I once listened to an indept analysis of compressed files on a loudnessconvention of EBU by thomas Lund. He inverted a compressed track and combined it with the original one. What remained was the difference between the two. It was a pretty grusome distortion, which would lead to listening fatigue. i know from own experience that 128 kb files suffer in the high regions, especially when pushed to loud. Ofcourse encoding quality has an effect. Your opinion please?
So I know this bass player who always turns his volume up crazy high at gigs. I think it’s because of his hearing. He’s in his 50s and the rest of the band are in their 20s and 30s. Is that possible or is he just a show boater?
I’m sorry but what a bunch of pseudo science crap. Just a computer soundcard + (cheap?) headphones. Try it in real life with a decent DAC and amp and good set of speakers in a nice room, then what do you hear? If you only use your smartphone and earplugs and Spotify, sure you won’t notice
The mp3 files are not noticeable when I hear electronic, pop, hip hop. But Rock, Classical, DnB, Jazz, or somethig with a huge orchestration I can hear diferences between quality.
I had an experience recently re-mastering an old analogue recording that featured a synthesised EMS Synthi style falling whistle, and it suddenly appeared in the most unmusical way. I had to view the audio spectrum to see that it started several bars earlier way up at 18kHz+ then get my 14 year old daughter to listen and tell me how that part was balanced. She reported that at a nominal listening volume the whistle was piercing for her at that frequency, and I was able to paint in a 6dB drop, which fixed it.\n\nAcuity of hearing doesn't simply relate to frequency, but to differentiation. Many older people (I'm 57 - is that old?) begin to lose the ability to pick one sound out from another, because of damage and wear to the cilia in the cochlea. That does affect which frequencies we can hear, because you lose cilia, but it can also affect the signals that are sent by the cochlea for processing in the brain if the microtubules in the cilia are affected by degradation caused by age or illness. \n\nLike Rick says, our brains are very good at compensating, but only up to a point. It becomes especially apparent when dealing with new sounds or combinations of sounds, and we can hear this in some recorded music. For example, Frank Zappa's later remixes of his early work were really very poor and have had to be remastered again. He was quite ill when those mixes were done, either by him overseeing them or actually hands on.\n\nTurns out I can only hear up to about 14kHz on a good day, but if I'm tired or my ears have been abused for a few hours by too much work, it can fall drastically.\n\nThe good news is that there are lots of spectral tools that can report on dB values at all the frequencies, and if you are dealing with known instruments and gear experience will go a long way. Also, there is very little in the post 10 kHz range that is not directly harmonically connected to the lower frequencies, so unless you are constantly pushing the higher frequencies it'll probably be OK.\n\nAge sucks, but technology saves.
Really liking this kind of content, Rick. Dispelling misconceptions gives me a real charge and fuels my musical endeavors more than all the reading about xyz products etc ever could.
but random guessing would've been 33.3% she got twice that and i got 100% bad video
Interesting video. Snobbish audiophiles remind of people who claim to know good wine. I wonder how well they'd be able to identify wines if we switched labels and price tags, etc.
I've been enjoying and learning from these videos for some time. Thank you, Rick--I should subscribe, but I'm afraid that I won't be able to keep up.  But a few points with respect to this one. \n\nThis seems to have become a wide ranging discussion as to the audio quality of MP3s.  \nThe first point I would make about this is that different is not the same as inferior.  There are a lot of audiophiles that prefer the sound of vinyl--they're not wrong about that--it's what they prefer.  (BTW--what's with all of this criticism of audiophiles?  I'm not one, but I have to note that they are maybe the most avid purchasers of music. What kind of business considers its best customers stupid?)\n\nI think what this test shows is that there's a difference in quality.  In every case, she was able to choose one as superior--she heard a difference.  I suspect a recording will in most cases sound best on the technology it was engineered for.  If it's 320bit, 320bit will sound best.  Criticizing and artists choice of medium is about the same as criticizing his/her melodic choices.\n\nHaving said that, I have no doubt that 128bit MP3s are objectively inferior, and I believe that their prevalence has dumbed down music consumers and the industry.  Harmonies and voicings are much simpler than in the 60s-80s and counterpoint has all but disappeared from pop music (see video why is modern pop music so terrible).  I am hopeful that higher bit rates will lead to better music.  I think that's the only way for this business to recover--Despite all of the great musicians active today (and there are a lot), kids today don't appreciate music the way we did.
Thankyou!!! I’ve been saying this to people for years myself.. \nto think of the money people waste
Let me point out that the mp3 test she took is flawed for a number of reasons. \n\nFor example, listening to a sample for the second time *will* alter your memory of the previous one. We also filter things we already heard as soon as they repeat, with varying intensity depending on what it is. And, we tend to look for details in the wrong places when consciously comparing them sequentially (unfortunatelly it's almost impossible to compare sounds simultanously).\nNot to mention that memory gets altered slightly everytime we access it, so listening to a sample of a song we know has an impact on our response to it, especially the first time.\n\nI liked your video, but you presented a question about one subject and showed and argument for your opinion which is a little unrelated.\nPeople can have a better or worse experience due to slight differences in sound quality, and they might even not be able to pinpoint it, since sound is so subjective. So in my opinion, talking about audio file compression is a separate subject.\n\nBut on THAT subject, I think you focused too much on the high-frequencies compression, when I believe you actually know that mp3 does a lot more. Personally, what bothers me most is usually in the lower bands, or when the music is too busy and loud that the original limiting gets very distorted.\n\nJust my two cents.
I could easily tell the difference on my phone speaker, compression algorithms have very distinct sound signatures especially in the way they reproduce sibilance. you can look up an example of all the sound frequencies thats removed from an mp3 and use it to train your ears on what to look for in various compression systems.
From working/recording as a musician in well known studios in London, and speaking as an audiophile myself, I've learnt that its the 'guy/gal behind the desk' that makes or breaks the outcome of any recording. After speaking with many engineers about this topic over the years, the general consensus is that it is not the technology itself that defines the quality of the outcome, but the IMPLENTATION of the technology. I own a Linn/Naim/Epos system at home and it is what you could call a high resolution system. I own some '70s digital master vinyl recordings that sound simply sublime, '70s analogue vinyl that sounds awful, modern digital that sounds awful, modern analogue that sounds sublime plus everything in between. All of it comes down to the skill of the engineer. A badly placed mic will sound second rate no matter what it's plugged into - Garbage in, Garbage out as they say.\n\nHowever....\n\nThe quick A/B demos Michelle took part in don't really offer much help though. I used to work occasionally in a specialist HiFi store back in the '80s and a first generation 14bit CD player would 'wow' customers compared to a cultured vinyl front end due to its artificially bright, forward tonal balance. But like a TV with superficially bright, dazzling colours, it soon becomes fatiguing to experience. Long term listening is required for a better judgement. Its the sign of a poor system if you're reaching for the remote to flick tracks - a good system should be compelling to listen to, rather than 'impressive'.\n\nUltrasonic frequencies are known to resonate with audible frequencies which is often cited as one of the reasons for analogue having a more 'natural' sound than digital. Just because we cannot 'hear' above 22k, it doesn't necessarily mean we cannot 'hear' the effects of >22k on what we CAN hear <22k. At the other end of the spectrum, subsonic frequencies have been shown to affect mood for example. So I think in regard to data compression, it's risky to chuck out duplicated - (superfluous (?)) or inaudible frequencies with these data compression algorithms, as these frequencies affect our brains processing of what we hear in ways which we do not perhaps fully understand. How many harmonics are produced by that single violin note? No doubt many duplicated by the French horn and snare drum? Do they interact on an inaudible, but vital way?\n\nWe humans are very clever with our algorithms, but we can't shortcut or outwit nature. Our perception of music through hearing processes evolved over hundreds of thousands years is perhaps too complex to be quantified or fully understood, let alone managed by relatively primitive, juvenile technology. Personally I'm convinced we need as faithful a reproduction of all frequencies inside and outside the audible range no matter how many are duplicated simultaneously, as that is what would happen in a real world, live, acoustic environment with no electronic processing whatsoever, regardless of bit/sampling rate. No disrespect to Michelle or anyone else, but through a high resolution system - perhaps headphones in front of a computer screen is not ideal? - a data compressed version of a full resolution recording is, to my ears at least, clearly inferior, in ways that cannot be 'measured' eg. emotional communication. Does that compressed version of an Eddie Van Halen solo make you want to jump up and play air guitar? Or Gorecki's Symphony #3 make you cry? In my experience, no. These factors cannot be measured, but they are demostrably real, and surely the very escence ie. the whole point of music in the first place? Data compression works, but does it? No point in chucking the baby out with the bathwater.\n\nIts interesting that in studios I've worked in which have absolute state of the art equipment, when the production team and their musician friends are working on a pet music project for fun in their own time, with all that equipment at their disposal, they often dust off the old analogue 1/2 in the corner because there's just something about it.
Take a .wav and stack it with the phase inverted high quality .mp3 to render the audio track of only what IS cut out in the .mp3. Its a fun little demo and everyone should do it with their favorite piece of music. Depending on the song and style, it will be mostly transient energy and extra low bass reverb that is left. Sometimes funny bits of vocals come through, But you typically have to boost the levels a lot to really hear much at all. The problem is most streaming and internet audio comes across at 128 or maybe 256 and you can still hear those artifacts on metallic sounds. Ask yourself what is about 12-14Khz and it's mostly metals. This is because real metals produce such complex overtones. Wood instruments and most electronic instruments . . . it won't make much of a difference.
I listen to CDs 😕
Got 3 outta 6. The 3 i missed were in 320. Most of que wav tracks had some kind of liveliness to them that the others didn't. I noticed that especially when there were strings, spacious reverbs and sub bass sine waves
In my own tests, mp3 at any bitrate has flaws in reproducing transients, especially in high frequencies. The treble sound becomes indistinct, hazy, the opposite of crisp.  I don't notice this on every track.  It depends on the material.  128k has fairly awful treble sound.  I noticed very little improvement from 192k to 256k, above that no difference at all. (320k is a waste).  So it's not just about frequency range, although it's true 128k is low-pass filtered at 16kHz, 160k at about 20kHz.\n\nI also tested AAC+, and this format is vastly better.  The ogg format is nearly as good.  Above about 120k AAC+ I cannot tell the difference from uncompressed WAV at all.  Crisp, clear treble transients.
I got 4 out of 6, didn't select the 128K mp3 at all. \n\nThe Coldplay sample was horrible, over produced, over excited, over compressed. 10 seconds was enough.
Offering it in a lossless format means people can choose to transcode to whatever format they want. For example 100kbit/s OPUS (try some ABX testing with that!).\n Transcoding MP3 to other lossy formats can lead to audible artifacts that wouldn't be there with the original source.
T you Rick is it possible that a lot of people can hear the diference?? YES!!!  Is it possible that a lot of people can't hear the diference?? YES!!! in some days my computer makes a background noise trough all the soundcard, and some days-hopeflly the majority-don't, some days i'm tired and some other i'm not, and yes it makes a difrence, have you heard placebo effects???? ...these to say Thank you Rick i've been learning a lot with you, and by now i've learned some things that search for perfection that is not on our reach., i'm producing in propellerheads reason/samson resolv and, as the time passed, is my knowledge that really makes the diference bcause when i bounce it outthere and play it wherever outside it sounds intirelly diferently from place to place, so audioFiles or audioFooles, cd or cassete recorder blá blá blá..., 50% 4 each other.. again Thank You very much Rick we all are intitled to our opinion and yes i've understood yours, better some days,  i'm the best and others just a fool you know???so let them speack wathever..
Jazz in mp3 format totally sucks. For that matter any digital format is inferior to vinyl for jazz. You listen to jazz on vinyl (with good headphones) that hasn't touched the digital realm at all, strictly analog, and you can hear the overtones on the bass, the saxophonist's fingers moving on the keys, the drummer's foot moving on the high hat stand. You are in the room with the band. \n\nI ripped all my CDs into iTunes as mp3s and noticed a digital distortion caused by the overtones in the ride cymbal. A hissing, crackling sound. You can hear it on a lot of jazz uploaded on YouTube. I went back and ripped my whole collection as Apple Lossless and the hiss is gone. Fuck mp3s.
I am here only for the comments ;-).
When i listen to music im familiar with i can clearly hear a distinction between 192 kbps and 320 kbps, when i listen for the difference between 320 kbps and 1140 kbps id like to think im hearing a difference, but not nearly as distinct as 192 vs 320, and this is with headphones, without the headphones and music that im highly familiar with it would probably be even tougher.
i only got 2/6 and chose the 320 kbps on the other 4.
this is good! thanks Tim Bell of Grace Music Academy
''...their ears and their experience give them the taste to know what sounds good''  Absobloodylutely spot on.
Check out the Absolute Sound for some chuckles. You can spend huge dollars for low-oxygen cables and even cable risers that keep your speaker runs off of the floor because that would muddy the sound(?!}. Actually, I think  in light of the current 'good enough'  state of the art (ex: cell phones and poor connections), a 192k mp3 is certainly good enough to get the message across while I'm listening on my earbuds on the train with lots of other noise going on. I even sometimes mix with just earbuds. This from a guy who owns Avalon, Tubetech, Fearn and other expensive gear but thats another story.  Cheers!
As an audio file I applaud your candid truthfulness and finally somebody has said exactly what I've been saying for years. Thank you.
I used to spend so much time researching the difference between WAVs and 320kb MP3's and I really, really wanted to be able to hear the difference. I soon accepted the fact I couldn't at all and that it didn't matter. Although I still prefer having WAV files to MP3s lol, I like to believe it's better quality to my ears I guess.
Burning down the BS!
I was so stoked at doing this test. Turns out it's the well known NPR test me and my son already did a while back :)
Classical composers tend to peak between 50 -70 also. Could also have to do with the maturity of hearing
Hey Rick, fan of the channel. However, would like to point out the following flaw with the test the lady did. I took the test myself a year ago. Consider this: is the setup used for the test capable to reproduce higher quality digital files with higher quality at analog end? If the dac makes a bad job of doing so then the test is by enlarge irrelevant. All components of the sound reproduction chain are important and the weakest bit is what you are hearing in the end.
I am not audiophile and neither a audio-fool, but this is not a fair test as I see it! First computer DAC are frequently terrible and headphone sets are as well BAD on average! So... I think that you need good equipment to take advantage of lossless files, I agree that 320Kb mp3 is fine for most of the people but also think that if you listen this test through a good equipment most of people will guess more than 50% for sure! Because you can't find low bass and high frequencies that you skin feels through average equipments... I can't listen anything behind 18800Khz but I can feel it I'm sure!
Do I need an uncompressed file when I'm recording, editing and producing audio? Absolutely. Do I need it during playback? Probably not. There are a few factors that come into play in this argument though. Certain types of music may be (however unlikely) more affected by data compression than others. If there are more complex overtones and tremendous dynamic range present in the audio track, there may be a greater chance for a perceptible difference. Messing with the dynamics? Possibility of artifacts? Perhaps. At 128 kbps, there is a clear perceptible degradation of fidelity but at 320 kbps, I think the chances are very slim, even in a proper listening environment (Yes. That means good quality loudspeakers in an acoustically treated room and not headphones). Maybe 1 out of a thousand tracks will be perceptibly affected but one thing is certain. The fear of quality loss is far greater than any actual loss when it comes to 320 kbps mp3. On the consumer end, pretty much no one (audiophiles included) will be able to tell the difference in a realistic listening scenario.
I got 3 out of 6 correct in the NPR test. Really 320 kbps and WAV file do sound similar. Listened on ATH M30.
I am hear all the difference clearly, but anyway i can't sing on the pitch. -_-
Watching her take that test gave me the idea that you could play all the tracks from your new album in random order, and try and have her match up the titles with the tracks and see how many she gets right.
Thanks, Rick. I did a similar test some years ago, and it cured me from being an audiofool. \n\nAnother cure for those who are still skeptical: buy two similar headphones (same type and price range) from different brands. For instance a Sennheiser (easy going type of sound) and ditto Beyerdynamic (somewhat brighter sounding). Listen to one pair of headphones exclusively for some time (at least a few hours, a bit longer for more dramatic effect). Now switch to the other pair. \n\nIf you started with the Sennheiser, the Beyerdynamic will sound way too bright. If you started with the Beyerdynamic, the Sennheiser will sound dull/boring. But if you keep listening for a while, your ears (actually your mind) will adapt. Both will sound fine after a few hours.      \n\nBottom line: you listen with your mind as much as with your ears. That's why mp3's work the way they do. Your mind focuses on what's important and ignores what's not. If you do research on what the average mind doesn't notice, you can leave it out, with some margin of error for the golden ears among us. 320 kbps has a fairly inclusive margin of error, if you ask me.
Thanks for this video !\nPerhaps this is meaning music is just emotion, not sound quality. And emotion is not money, high priced monitors, high frequencies, perfect studio conditions, etc.\nFor people old enough I'm sure we can all remember a piece of music we loved and that we were hearing on vinyl with cracks, noises, track jumps, or, even worst, on tape, perhaps recorded from a AM radio with frequency shifts, blips, ghost noises... And the emotion was higher than a perfect sounding other piece.\nMusic is emotion. And emotion is not money (or technical means). Emotion is more like love than maths.\nIn a lot of productions we even add distorsion, blips, and analog noises to bring back such emotion...\nSo just  listen to music with your heart, it is better at knowing if music is good or not than your ears !\nAnd when a poser will come to tell you with sophisticated arguments mp3 is ruining music, just give him the link to this excellent Rick video :-)
Hello Rick, I also got 4 out 6 jeje, no music degree here, mere luck probably jaja :), But I do have started collecting 24/96 flac files and a few DSD
Amen for posting this. I can't believe people argue against this obvious conclusion. Because they have failed in other parts of their life they want to believe they are somehow superior at more subjective things.
Hi Rick, what are your thoughts on MQA? I've just become aware of it and sounds exciting. Really love and appreciate your channel. Thanks, Jamey
Hi Rick! Could you do an episode on how musicians/composers/engineers with hearing problems deal with (their) music. Both as a performer and a simple listner ?
I engineered a while some loudspeakers. The effect of your listening room and the reflections, absorbing and resonance is much more important than any samplingrate, the noise of your turntable or the kind of cable between amplifier and speaker.\nBut no digital format ever gets the spirit of a LP ever. \nBut I prefer to listen digital. Its better.
A lot of the myths came about in the early days of AD and DA converters.  There were dreadful artefacts added to early digital recordings because of very audible harmonics introduced by crude digital low pass filters that should have let 19K and below through but also added many overtones in the audible spectrum as a side effect.  You can hear them on some early digitally recorded Madonna and Michael Jackson records.  The early DA converters also had similar issues with poor sample clocks and filters, especially those used in early MP3 players.  All this badly implemented digital circuitry caused the myths of being able to 'hear' digital v analogue and CD vs high bit rate MP3.  Modern clocks, filters, converters and ultra high bandwidth DSP processors at a cost of pennies make these problems a thing of the past but unfortunately the myths have a truth from the past and stick with us.
The source content quality is key as is the monitoring devices being used. If the source material is not recorded, mixed or mastered well, the differences in many cases will be negligible when processed down to 320kbps or even lower. I have heard plenty of bad mixes that were dense and squashed to death played back at 44.1 that didn't sound any different when processed at varying bit rates all the way down to 128. The better the source content, the more noticeable the differences particularly with acoustic music with complex frequency content, ambient space and extensive dynamic range. I was a Spotify subscriber for quite a while and streamed at 320k until I switched to Tidal which offers uncompressed streaming. I also went back and played CD's in my collection and was shocked how much I had been conditioned to accept what I had been missing. Music I had listened to for years suddenly had more depth. I could hear more detail in reverb tails, more shimmer in the cymbal decays, and a deeper overall soundstage. I am 57 years old, and even with my well worn ears, I can clearly hear a difference dependent upon musical genre and quality of the original source content.
How old is Michelle?
The amps, the speakers, and the player matter and much, even cables, it is not snobbery, it is Hi Fi against cheap and poor quality equipment, be sure. Not too much people can hear the diference between your 1173 Neve pre amps and lets say a cheap audio interface pre amp. but there is, and a lot. To me it is due that not too much people can listen to the Neve 1173 in action, same when they compare software vs hardware, there is a lot of diference but people like to said no there is not, come on...
But what if you're a bat or Daredevil?  LOL\nIt's not -audiophile- but *technophile*\nPeople have fallen in love tech not actual music.
Hi Rick! I think it is a similar issue to having a perfect pitch or not. When you have a very good hearing, you just do and you physically can’t enjoy mp3s. Also, my guess is that quite a lot of people hear the difference but without realising it. I often noticed while playing music to friends that if I play a CD, they still chat. When I play a high quality wav, they stop talking and start only listening. I don’t ask them to, of course! – it just happens. I think it can be common that people might not consciously notice the difference but it will affect their enjoyment and appreciation of music.\n\nI hear very high frequencies, over 20 K for sure, I think close to 25 K (I hear devices made to scare off animals, very loud, and they are supposed to produce a sound around 25 K – other people who were with me couldn’t hear them at all, I could hear them so loud they were extremely irritating). Humans don’t hear these frequencies as loud as the main frequencies in our hearing range but they are part of the sound world around us and part of recorded music. When music is converted into mp3 or mastered, something ugly happens to those high frequencies; I think the mastering makes them too loud and in the case of the mp3 I think they are replaced with something else, must be some lower frequencies, and THEN they really become noticeable, in a nasty way, especially while listening on headphones. It is like having your ears pierced with rusty needles, especially while listening to the (“good”) 320 kbps mp3s – 128 kbps sound poor and limited but at least they are not hurting me on the headphones. Also, something is missing, some kind of “breath” or “halo” or “haze” around the sound. I think that more people hear them (at least a little bit) than they realise, but they don’t pay attention – and after several hours of working with music, or being in a loud environment, of course your ears get tired and one might not notice such subtle things any more. This would explain why Michelle failed to identify the best quality file at the end of the test – her ears were already a little tired, and also – as she said she loved that song – she might have gone for the quality she was most used to, the mp3 - probably she had heard it in this format many times.\n\nI think it’s not just the age that has to do with how well you hear but how much noise you have been exposed to – the mixing engineers you mention have worked with sound for many years, many hours a day, probably often at high volumes, so it must have affected their hearing. I have a (musician) friend who is close to 50 and he can hear very high frequencies about as well as me – but he never listens to music loud and gives his ears a lot of rest. It is probably genetic, too, like a lot of things.\n\nI wouldn’t agree that the mixing engineer’s hearing in the high range doesn’t make a difference – yes, the skill is the most important, but when I worked with sound engineers who hear (a lot) less in the high range, they always made the high instrumental parts too loud, I had to ask them to correct it. I also noticed sound engineers who didn’t hear very well in the high range didn’t always notice when the sound was clipping, unless it was very loud and obvious, or didn’t notice other “pollution” on the recording when there was for example a problem with the grounding and it affected the recording. A mixing engineer who is aware of it can predict and correct a lot but it, maybe using those strategies you are talking about – ? – but it is not true it doesn’t matter how much you hear. But I think it is a bigger problem when a mastering engineer can’t hear the high frequencies because he will make horrible, “biting” masters, like a lot of modern mainstream pop.
Informative and fun  video.
I agree with Rick 1,000%.  The audiophile world is as full of snake oil as any area of human behavior that you can name. I have listened to the same music on LP, mp3 128k, 192k, 320k, wav file, flac and 24/192. tube gear vs high end solid state.\n320k is fine for most music, especially rock, pop and most jazz.  Each person's ears are so different. You just have to find the gear that pleases you and not worry about what so-called golden ear critics like. Most of the time their livelihood depends on foolish rich people way over-spending. Fine, god bless them. But you can get plenty good sound for very reasonable money, and you don't have to monkey around with flacs. btw, I think they use NS-10's just to replicate the sound of car speakers! Just one person's opinion.  Thanks for another great video, Rick!
I think it really depends on the quality of the playback speakers.  On crappy systems, or built in computer audio converters, you probably can't differentiate but on a true audiophile system I think you can.
In the early 90s, I read of a study, in recording engineer magazine, as I recall. Maybe it was mix, or another fairly  technical periodical. Some Japanese researchers did an a/b test,of digital vs analogue recordings. Instead of asking subjects to identify what they were hearing they measured brainwave responses. After 2o minutes, neocortex hemispheres went into an entrainment ( usually one is dominant,and this switches back and forth cyclically) mode. Digita; source never stimulated this entrainment response. I have not found any follow up on this.
Have you ever listened to Jim O'rourke? Im really interested in his style of composing like in The Visitor and another album called Eurkea.
I don't disagree with you regarding the negligible audible difference however there is another reason why you should offer your music in a non-lossy format, like flac. Transcoding from one lossy format to another (even from mp3 to a different bitrat mp3) causes degradation. If someone has your music in mp3, and for some reason wants it on another format (maybe  as a smaller mp3 for listening on their phone, maybe 10 years from now in some newer format), transcoding it will degrade the quality.
I'd much rather hear Charlie Parker with Strings on my 1970 turntable than any audio file. Call me old fashioned..
Great video
Champion 👌🏽
Rick ... I hear ya!
Solution: FLAC
Thank you!!
Scientists noticed that our ears mask those frequencies and we can’t hear them — from where you get those info dear Rick - please pay attention what you spread on the internet - there is enough of bad stuff out there - \nalso for your info - it has nothing to do with finding a work around if they have loss in hearing - the head will compensate for that - as simple as that - no one was born with the same Freq. response on both ears - like everything in your body ;-) \nSeries follower
No one uses CD players any more? Last time I looked CDs were responsible for about 50% of the music industry's revenue - significantly more than downloads. I wonder what people are doing with all these CDs if they don't have a CD player.
Hi Rick, Ed Chang here. I agree that the standard of using wav or flac is 99% bragging rights. One point I'd like to mention out of my own experience tho:\nI used to encode at VBR 0 for awhile. Then I noticed that during fade-ins of high frequency textures/drones (such as found in lots of electronic music (cough including true electronic music such as Gesang der Junglinge :) ) I would hear intermittent dropouts in the volume envelope. However by encoding at 320k, the issue was resolved. All of this falls in line with your argument above.\nI have to say tho, I do mix down and store all of my own music to uncompressed wav, since, obviously those will be mangled in other ways before they get to my iPhone haha! OK great work, peace!
It's in the brain, not the ears. :)
What about the difference between 44.1khz to 48khz to 96khz... ain't it there where the real quality improvement can be identified? CD's can only play 44.1khz. that's a restriction that isn't there anymore now!
I don't disagree that the formats are virtually indistinguishable. But testing a naive listener (someone who hasn't spent much time distinguishing between formats) makes no sense. They have no idea what to listen for. The ironic part of this test is that the listener feels it's valid to choose between the formats: they feel that the formats are distinguishable. She didn't finish the test and say, THEY ALL SOUND THE SAME. So they probably don't sound the same.
i got 5/6. and without perfect pitch. explain THAT, Beatus.
Rick, i've spent the last week catching up on your latest videos, loving the content....congrats on eclipsing 150,000 subscribers
I agree, but there is still a point with having the higher quality recordings available -- I wouldn't be surprised if there is gonna be technology in the future that is able to take advantage of the higher quality files somehow. \nI don't fault you for not wanting to distribute the lossless files, as long as you actually have them available for the future.
What’s the song at the end?
the ending reminds me of an anime end credtis
Why do I got a big crush on him?

This shit gay
damn, this took a while...
And so I have seen the Eternal Kingdom
How many frames per second did you have to draw??
That was so satisfying to watch omg
The person is me going through life XD
This is absolutely incredible!
This is awesome! Thank you for taking so much time to make this. I remember playing this game in school!
this is one of the best things I have ever f-ing seen in my entire life.
We should send this out in a space probe to show what humanity is capable of
This is the best I loved it every second of it 😂👍🏽
this is so cool. Smiling the whole way through. :D Instant like!
This is definitely one of those I need to share this sort of things. Great job!
As a musician, the broken measure lines make me really uncomfortable. But still a great work of art
Holy shit please do the intro to 'Runaway' by Kanye West, it's fairly simple.
extremely good !! I really enjoyed it
This made me grin likr a fool. I loved the backwards bits as they surprised me. BRAVO.
Who else came from band???
For some reason, 1:39 on made me super nervous, probably cause that due was falling for what seemed like forever.
holy shit this is amazing
I thought this game died
Wow! Good for you! :) I love Edvard Grieg!
It's amazing how you were able to portray details like dynamic changes, accents, and just make everything so damn engaging and entertaining to watch. That's fucking awesome.
hi DoodleChaos, I like your work very much, I would like to communicate with you, do you have an email adress ?
That was a masterpiece... bravo!
This is so Fantastic&Amazing.\nNice work!!
Nice work. Excellent timing!  That must have been quite difficult.
What a wonderfully musical interpretation
So first off, let me say I truly adore this and believe it is magnificent. However, the perfectionist within me wanted to point out that there is a small synchronization error at 38-39 seconds. I don't know how hard it would be to adjust it to make it perfect, but I felt I needed to state it incase the creator wanted to continue working on it or adjust it. Regardless, really outstanding job.
Awesome ! So nostalgic about this game hahah \nGreat work guy
Men that is pure perfection
Holy shit! That was amazing!
This is the best thing on the internet so far!
I can't help whatching this over and over again... epic!!
That was super cool dude, nice job. I would not have the patience to do something like that, very nice.
Genius! Absolutely fucking genius!\n👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏\nThis one of the reasons I'm happy to pay Internet bill.\n👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Музыкальная наркомания
This is genuinely one of the coolest things I have ever seen on YouTube.
HAHAHA YOU HAVEN'T LIVED LIVE TILL YOU'VE WATCHED THIS VIDEO
This is beyond amazing, absolutely made my week or so ;)
I've played this game. I've known about it ever since it first came out, and I'll say this is one of the most impressive projects I've ever seen anywhere. Seriously, how much time must have gone into making this, truly unbelievable. I'm very impressed
LINE RIDER IS MAKING A COMEBACK, FUCK YES!
Lmao bill warts (created of the history of Japan and history of the world) his video with the thumbnail saying outside is the top recomended video
This must have taken so long to create, I they started while line rider was still relevant
I totally forgot about this phase of my childhood, thankyou
One of the most satisfying thing I've seen in my long life.
Mommy! look what I just did!
Best Line Rider video I've ever seen. This game is a proper blast from the past, good to see it's still being played.
Any way to see the whole drawing in one picture?
Surprised this game still exists!
That was a journey. Super awesome!
the game of source is X-Moto?
Very Clever!!! I love and appreciate music! This is great!
That was A MAI ZING
Its not the prettiest Line Rider course I've ever seen... but it's by far the absolute best. Well done sir. Well fucking done.
People still use line rider? Fuck
Sounds like another person is Riding through downtown on their way to work on a bicycle.
Absolutely brilliant! and so in tune with the movement of the music! Well done
This is beautiful. Thank you for showing us this.
One of the best I ever seen. Well done sir!
The friction burn starting at 2:03  x.x

This is an old video. He was only joking. Tyrese is a cry baby and a diva.
They playing
Dwayne Johnson it's about time you addressed his black ass. Not only does his independent music sound like shit but he looks like a big black piece of long shit while he's dissing black  women and going on his senseless rants that nobody cares about. Thank you Dwayne  we know he's not worth your time but that's what he wanted  your time since he's not working  that's all he has is time. Keep winning Mr.Johnson
Now I know he is mad but that album was good. He is just being mean I hate to see these two brothas at each other's throats like this.
This is an old video and The Rock was joking.
Thanks Dwayne. All he does is diss black women. Fuck this nigga. Black as his black ass IS. He got some fucking nerve.
If my love for The Rock was slowly fading. The love has been restored after watching this. Shout out to The Rock boo!
To fucking funny mr. Johnson is hilarious
Lmfao damn he's childish and not the mother fucker at the end😂😂
Tyrees, need to stop you seriously got issues. Start to believe the story about you abusing your daughter. You and Rock was cool and then you going to start shit because, of a movie, stop the bullshit life is to short for nonsense✌🏾😜
EXCUSE ME Rocks wife, I must say u have 1 fine Ass Husband.   Get that show on tv as quick as possible so ur fans can watch u weekly.  Keep pumping that Iron cause that body is the Rock! Cute face ball head makes u hotter!   I hope u have Luv scenes!
The rock is the king of petty y'all must not have seen WWF LOL
He's my moms face
This guys supposed to be rich, yet he lives in a trailer??
Guys I just looked up that album it came out 2 years ago apparently.
It's all for publicity
What in the actual fuck is happening
Dwayne is over rated. Fuck you dwayne
THAT ALBUM IS FROM 2015 WTF IS THIS????????????
DAM ROCK YOU WENT IN LIKE  THE BAD MF YOU ARE👍👍👍👍
Even if this was a joke.  We all know any album tyrone puts out is donkey shit
He needs to get his motherfucker lessons from the boondocks asap😂😂
CAN U, SMELLLLLLLLL WHAT TYRESE IS, COOKINGGGG??  A BIGG PEACE OF BLACK SOFT DOGGSHITT!!!
This was almost 4 years ago in 2015 when they were cool. I'm sure he was joking lol
I'm just a little disappointed that it wasn't ended with a if you smell what The Rock is cookin
The Rock is in WWF promo mode right now. Tyrese you not fucking with this lol
Y'all messy... This is old
I ain't even hating or anything but I just hear it right now and I agree with Dwayne😂😂😂
Fuck black roses go up my ass
DO YOU SMELL WHAT THE ROCK JUST COOKED? \n\n\n\n\n\nYep its called Tyrese on a platter with a black Rose 😂🤣😂🤣😂 \nTyrese gon leave ppl tf alone.
Where is his beard
Cryrese messing with the Rock's $. He's gonna get his ##Candyass beat. 😂😂 Y'all wrong for putting this OLD video out to be taken out of context.
The only really good song is addict I'll admit but the rest was garbage besides 2 or 3 more songs
Lol. He has a point. I only liked one song.
Lol the Rock gave him the people's mouth lol get his @$$
You can’t disrespect someone from the attitude era bitch ! The great one is still great.
Reminds me of his wrestling days. Don't come for The Rock unless he sends for you! Guess Tyrese just got the smack down! 😂😂😂
The album is typical black homeless crackhead singing 🎤 in a ⛺️
This video is old. Rock was being funny. And was helping Tyrese promote the album. Rock is a lot bigger now. And has a grey beard. Y’all will believe anything.
that was fucked up
Smh I like them both but this is really old and he was joking around with tyrese. Rock was filming one of the ff movies as well as filming for the show ballers. It pays to do research y'all. Ppl have to learn to stop burning bridges when your angry with a close buddy.  Idk either one personally but Tyrese went to find this video at great lengths to make it seem like the rock is a horrible guy. Makes you wonder what does this say about Tyrese's character though.
Just beat his ass rock.  Fuck cryrees. AnD Kevin  hart to i hate that bitch bonus punch please 2 for one slap him back on the bus singing for a Pepsi
damn
😭😭😭😭
😂😂😂
Tyrese is a cry baby bitch
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯
🔫🔫🔫🔫😂😂😂😂
😂🤣💯
LMAO. I love Dwayne
I love him
😂
SHOOT
Fuck u rock
ooh my
Yah it price of shit
😂😂😂😂😂💀
Damn lol Tyrese brought out the old school Rock 😂😂😂
Go in ROCK YESSSSS THE OL ROCK BACK
Don't fuck with the rock t u not ready.
This was a joke. Dwayne was filming FF and Ballers at the same time so he was in character.  Cryrese posted it and was laughing a few years ago, and now he tries to flip it and make it seem like Dwayne did this in to be mean.
Was that a joke or what. I really thought they was finished with the B'S Rock and if don't like the guy why did u listen to the album anyway. SMH grown men
Yall. Live talking to me bitches eats this pussy
Hee! Hee! I don't know if Rock is joking or what but this was funny.
Dwayne went OFF!
Everybody know the rock has a beard now lol clearly old when tyrese released black rose witch was last year
Didn't black rose come out a while ago?
This has to be a publicity stunt right? Lol like wtf
Well damn. I bought it last year, got some cute songs but nothing to go crazy over. Aint trash at all.
😳
I tell u what u fine Ass hunk of a man.   U so sweet u have a Beautiful wife Beautiful daughter and im a fan.   Rock i just got to say Dammmmmmmm.,    I Luv It when u talk dirty.  Thats right respond to this dry lip jealous ass man.  FUCK Tyrese.
Yo this fucker is late as hell.. that album is old news and it's not even that bad.. what is his purpose with this
That's such an awesome story.
This animation was amazing.
Love this
who the hell dislikes this??
This is fucking cool and I appreciate it.
This was such a lovely surprise
Great animation! Where's my vault package at tho? Still haven't gotten it😂
Animation and Storytelling are both Ace. One gets the feeling that when Jack (John) really connects with someone, who has a heart as pure as his own, it's friends forever. Not many folks care to remember for a minute what you really want most let alone years. \n🎸🐧💙
Things like these are what makes life worth living.
Wow, what a tale :) Awesome animation!
Cried during that show.
This makes my heart ache for The White Stripes even more, especially since this was the last performance they did. I wish things wouldn't have fallen apart the way they did and that maybe some day by some miracle by the grace of God they can reunite and do even more great things. If Guns N' Roses can manage it, I don't see why The White Stripes can't.
What a very nice little animation. I love it.
Jack and Meg need to get back together for just one last gig
I love Conan and I love Jack and Meg
Thank you for the video :)
This was a beautiful story and video, thanks. :)
This is fucking amazing, god I wish they'd come back now more than ever. I really hope Meg is doing okay
was also tws last ever performance :(
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Amazing. Love it.
TEAM COCO FOREVER <3
That's awesome#
CRYING
Beautiful
Fantastic!
Very cool
The 333 White Stripes!! 🐧 Thanks Coco

Wow...

Distrac
When they spun Shaniqua I died😂😂😂
Caspar such a perv
Everybody talking about unsolved but did y'all realize this man  learned to fly by sneaking into random homes and playing simulations. He wild 😂
plot twist: the narrator is colton harris moore
when Unsolved is your most popular segment so you try to incorporate it into other videos
This should be an unsolved episode
The mini doc on tv about this guy is really interesting!
BuzzFeed is doing a lot of storytimes
as soon as i didn’t hear ryan’s voice i was pissed
This sounds like me. I go everywhere barefoot....I never leave prints tho (;
I thought it was big foot
I knew this ain't unsolved but still clicked it hoping that it might be 1% related to UNSOLVED.  The wheezes got me addicted.. Sorry not sorry. 😀 Can't wait for the new season starting today.  Shout out to Ryan and Shane,  I love you guys.
this is almost like a modern story of icarus and the sun....with the sun being his obsession/source of obsession to fly.
i did a project on this dude
That is a really cool story. I wish him the best.
Ok people put together the clues ok listen \n\nFriday \nBuzzed unsolved \n\n\n\nWhat can u infer by this \n\n\n\n\n\nYou buzzed videos only come out on Fridays I know it’s sucks
when it’s been over a week since the last buzzfeed unsolved and you settle for this
I remember watching a document on him like 3 years ago
Was this a class project Buzzfeed?
wow he was born on the same day I was born!well not on the same year tho
Ryan and Shane should just make their own channel . I'm sure it would take off . We need unsolved everyday not lame filler waiting for it to come out .
Guys get over it they missed an episode be happy with the free content you are getting
Why does this sound like Mr nightmare .. ?
He used to live in a half way house next to my apartments, that's where he actually ran way from, he shot our neighbors window out with a BB gun
BATHS ARE ILLEGAL OML I HAVE TO TELL THIS TO MY MOM
Can we leave the crime stories to Shane and Ryan? Please?
why does his voice sounds like Rami Malek
Come on guys, this isnt an unsolved mystery, nor does it say unsolved anywhere in the title. Obviously not going to be an episode of unsolved.
His mother lived next door to my aunt’s farm on a small island in Washington! Always signs saying do not enter, etc.
I hope he gets to fly again!!!
Was it just me or were there not enough details to make this story interesting??
I thought this was buzzfeed unsolved...disappointed
Why are people butthurt about this not from Unsolved when the title clearly reads Crazy story of the Barefoot bandit? It's pretty clear that this not an Unsolved episode. Idiots.
I want a shirt with hey demons its me ya boi printed on it
Here for the unsolved comments
Stop comparing it to buzzfeed unsolved ! I actually really like this it was so positive ! You just have to watch it all the way though.
IT WAS MOSE BUT IN SOCKS
Just like I am obsessed with BuzzFeed unsolved. I come to YouTube . Refresh the application again and again everyday to watch a new video, even though I know it comes on Friday. 😂
hey that's where I live
WE GET IT U THOUGHT IT WAS UNSOLVED GEEZ 😂
I don't like the narrator .... His voice isn't interesting
I thought it was buzzfeed unsolved then I realized its not the day they post
Who else thought this was a surprise unsolved video?
I don't get why everyone thought this was a buzzers unsolved video. They literally tell you the series, season, & episode #
My old co worker is currently dating this guy
Little town power electric tour wave.
I was born on March 22 too
I dont think people realize that this guy is like a modern day legend in the Bahamas XD
i love all the crime videos. i just don’t get why people are complaining that this isn’t unsolved, this is a bonus for people interested in this stuff
I live in mount vernon...
*why does every criminal story I hear happen in Washington state?!* I live in Washington state!
This would be a fucking great movie
thank you for doing him!!! for unsolved crime,  can y'all  do Sherri Pepini?
He broke into our house and stole some food and a dirt bike which he left broken down in the woods.
Was this story supposed to have a point?
Honestly whoever is doing the voiceover, your voice is 😍😍😍😍
I clicked on this misreading it as 'bigfoot bandit' and now I'm disappointed
no crimes unless it's unsolved maybe they want to give you some crime vids bc the current unsolved season is supernatural and they're tired of y'all complaining 🙃🙃🙃
why is everyone thought this was unsolved? we all know that unsolved uploads every friday. smh
Unlike a lot of people in the comments, I like crime videos along with unsolved videos so thanks for the extra cool vid
0:14 THE PRIDE OF MOUNT VERNON
Only here for all the comments about Unsolved. Looking forward to Friday as well.
Bare foot\nB foot\nBig foot\nCase Solved\n(I know it isn't Buzzfeed Unsolved)
Ahh! I finally just shared my coming out story!!
I remember when he was running around our islands. I’m sure that bastard stole my bike 😂
This was actually an interesting video, I liked it.\nThe video and its visual reenactment was well edited, in my opinion.\n\nSure, it's not Shane and Ryan, but this channel isn't all about them, they don't have their own channel, but maybe they'll be moved to their own channel like LadyLike.\n\nBut people gotta chill, man.\n\nThe people who did this video were cool to do this. I've never heard of this story before and it's pretty bizzare and out there.
Wtf ? Y'all better stopppp, this not Shane & Ryan bye.
There's no [WHEEZE]. I'm disappointed.
I don't know all the crimes he committed but I don't feel he deserved 7 years, he was underage and trying to survive.
pfffft, The Barefoot Bandit is nothing, have you ever ran into THE WET BANDITS??
How tF do you steal a plane
ummm,leave the crime stuff to the unsolved team
How do you fly a plane and not get caught
He was actually caught at a resort/restaurant/marina called Romora Bay in Harbour Island, Bahamas! My family used to go there all the time and the staff would wear shirts saying how they caught the Barefoot Bandit!
I like bare feet
Aha, you forgot something... *WHEEZE*
Elementary divorce reflection tennis diabetes owe battle.
Fucking this isnt buzzfeed unsolved. More like buzzfeed disappointment
I read Bigfoot. I'm disappointed
I thought this was buzzfeed unsolved 😭😭😭
I thought it was unsolved, wtf
*wheeze
Wtf
Murder of Selena Quintanilla
I thought this was buzzfeed unsolved XDD
Succeed emotion hope voice aim smile exist Irish knee consideration.
(Wheeze)
Not good enough for Unsolved?
Um... Ok
What???
Damn this ain’t Buzzfeed Unsolved, im sad
W H E E Z E
When a prodigy goes awry... temporarily.
Meh.
This was lame
this is weird
Buzzfeed SOLVED
I thought it said Bigfoot bandit
wtf I thought this was Buzzfeed Unsolved...
Ahhh clickbait
*wheeze* \n\n\n\n\nWrong video
Where’s oily sheen shane 😂😂

I loved this..great job.. congrats on the marriage... Great to have you back, I missed your videos
This is my mega favorite video of all times!!!
Brain, Huh wonder what all this fuss about the pink comb i..... Oh lordy.
If you like the comb she has a cod it’s called intoxicating sounds and it has the comb in it
Who gets help sleeping while listening to this? Because I've never listened to it while going to sleep
Nice to read these comments abt ppl listening to this with some super high quality headphones and getting amazing tingles when im over here with my old cheap earpuds, one of them twisted like fifteen times so it would be just in the right position to even work LMAOO
I'm getting tingles down to my feet hahahaha holy shit! I love you Maria
Those new mics... OMG! I feel the sound deep in my ear 😻😻 I LOVE THE SOUNDS IT MAKES, specially when you whisper 💕 Thank you so much!
“What do you think? Good?” YES! VERY GOOD!
Honestly, i love seeing people get new things. That happiness in tandem with ASMR... ugh just awesome. New mic asmr is some of the best there is, cuz people are just so excited to mess around with them and see what new triggers and stuff they can come up with.
I absolutely love sounds from behind the ear, especially whispers! So excited for your new videos with these microphones!
this is so tingly!! thanks <3
You are so amazing! Thank you for making going to sleep so much easier and pleasant 💕 kisses from Brasil
i feel like these mics would be good for a twin trigger word video
Omg I love your sweater it’s so cute!!❤️❤️
I like ASMR but never really got tingles, this is just realxing for me but I had tingles for the first time with this video !
Those back whispers omg made me go tingling overload but it made me move for some reason idk why
When Maria whispered in both mics, my whole body did a thing and I don’t know what it was but it needs to happen again
I love how in the description she shows the time! So exciting!   l( '.  ') l
That is such a cute choker! ^_^
Hey that's pretty good
gentle whispering makes a video called intense sounds. Arent those like opposites?
You look like the princess in Kingsman
You look like Amy Adams.
She is my first ASMR and i like what she does since i heard her videos, the best ASMR artist in my humbled opinion.
You look very attractive ♡. Amazing video. Love from the Netherlands
Well Gentle Whispering is becoming more and more a Godess isn't She? \nBest ASMR artist!
Hello!!\n\nYou can go to www.google.com for browsing!😋😋\n\nOr just relax😴😴
OKAY BUT GIRL I LOVE WHAT YOU'RE WEARING OMG
I was havin neck pain and it was makin me sick but this helped relax me
I can actually hear your heart beating!!!! those mics are insane, as are momentum 2 headphones (also senheiser)
Absolutely loved the new mics! Such clean, clear sound. Question,  have you done or plan to do a video with singing bowls? MassageASMR does several and they are great, but I would love to hear your voice narrate one!  :)
Love that jersey you have on 👍
Where do I subscribe to the pink comb channel?
This was a amazing test.Please please please do Moore.
I wonder what she would do for us, if we saved the world..
The whispering was amazing! Holy heck! Can you please do whispering video?
The pink comb is just simply amazing! 😍💕
You help me forget about the monsters in my house. Then I have dreams me and the monsters are all in a musical that takes place in my neighbourhood.  And then I realize the monsters want me dead.
That was really good. I love the camera effects and the brush. Your hair looks great too :D
Is this Lois Lane?
Oddly enough, you almost biting the fake pumpkin was a trigger...
I love your outfit! You look so pretty!
I Love These Microphones!! such amazing sound. please do more
I know im late but thank you. I was needing this. Badly. 😊

God she's hot as hell in this.\n\n\nWell, when isn't she.
This woman ages like fine wine 😍
I guess t so many tingls
When the ASMR artist is so good she nearly puts herself to sleep during her own video!
you know it's good when the ASMR-tist starts getting drowsy
Please do a Mercy Cosplay if you ever plan on going to BlizzCon lmao you'd win for sure 😭
1k people who watched this video got *triggered intensely* in the wrong way
YOU LOOK SO GOOD IN THIS WOW. ♡
You’ve really outdone yourself Maria. I barely lasted the intro before I was asleep.
this gave me the most tickles i've ever had in an asmr video!! loveed it <3
You remind me of my ex that cheated on me
Hard to go wrong with Sennheiser.
I hope one day I find someone to marry who enjoys the small things as much as you do. I keep to myself alot, fortified in my castle, but every now and then I look out the window and see people like you, and I wish I knew them, not just observed them. But I often worry that they wont want to know me, so I just keep to myself. I have watched your videos for years, always smiling, always sharing. Its nice to see. Thanks for being passionate about something you enjoy and allowing us to be apart of it.
You look like Amy Adams.
I feel like Maria was like half high or something in this video like just up there in a happy place she seemed so hAppy?? idk how to explain lol
what microphones are you using?
I am going thru thyroid cancer and some radiation and other health issues that keep me awake.  Thank you. Ur videos relax me.  I don't want anymore meds than what I already take.  You are wonderful!
The quality of your work is always amazing!  And you are so beautiful!  Thanks for being there on our sleepless nights for so long ❤❤❤
i want you to know that you look amazing here, Masha ☺️
I love your VOICE the most!♡

I teach high school English. We are doing childhood storybook characters for our department’s Halloween costumes. I’d love to see what character you’d choose. I want it to be scary but not too gory, and I also have to talk and move a lot in it. Any ideas from anyone are greatly appreciated!! PS: I’m on a budget. Thank you!
DRINKING GAME! SHOTS EVERY TIME SHE SAYS BEE OR MAKES A BEE PUN.
My 3 year old daughter turned around just as Careless Whisper started playing and burst out laughing saying you are a silly bumblebee, and now she wants to watch all of your videos...I'm going to go with maybe when you're older as an answer.  Just know you have a very young fan.

She’s a zom-bae-bee
Can she even write a bad song? Next time I'm just hitting Like before I even listen.
Lyrics:\n\nThere's a hole in the dry wall, still not fixed. I just haven't gotten around to it and besides, I'm starting to get used to the gaps. Say wish you could find some way to live to be so hard on myself, so why is it easy for everyone else. I'm not always like this, there's always tomorrow, I guess.\n\nAnd I never do it but it's not a joke. I can't tell the difference when I'm all alone. Is it real or a dream, which is worse, can you help me? I just wanted to go to sleep.\n\nWhen I turn out the lights. When I turn out the lights. There's no one left between myself and me.\nBut when I turn out the lights. When I turn out the lights. When I turn out the lights, there's no one left between myself and me.\n\n\n\nJB's new single is amaze y'all. Enjoy it. I sure am. 😊
I'm actually gonna fly from Moscow to Paris just to see her show in November...
This album is gonna be amazing.
Turn Out The Lights debuted at #9 on the New Alternative 40 Chart this week:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV1dMqeb4_U&list=PLxlSBzMcrtkMCVtuXEIz5BXpPfycTwsS5&index=9
It's Julien. Of course I'm gonna love it
She makes me want to be a better person
This is an entirely new level! Can't wait to hear her new album!
The tears are real son
Omg I wasn't prepared for this
And I thought I couldn't love her more
The perfect way to kick off fall is with a new Julien Baker song and a good cry. This is wonderful. <3
Only person in my life that makes me feel something and I'm tired of feeling nothing. ♥️🏳️‍🌈
I know its not her style, but im a sucker for at 2:30 if a full band came in and just thrashed the outro
So lovely, u are are my favorit artist Julien.
No one inspires me more than Julien does. Absolutely cannot wait to see her next week.
Darn. My life’s changed forever since I found Julien, and each song touches my soul in places I didn’t know existed before... Thank you.
When you ugly cry into a pillow for a solid hour, but it’s the best part of your day
Julien, you just get me. Thank you.
This song is a masterpiece <3
A new sooooong!
YES
2017s answer to 2016s Your Best American Girl by Mitski
this is art...
Oth anyone 😀😀😀
I thought this was brilliant, and then I listened to it with new headphones ... now brilliant doesn't seem good enough.
24 forest guards didn't like the video.
D A M N Jesse Cale music taste be poppin h a r d
Her songs would be great on Shameless
imagine a parody video that's just a cat chasing a laser
SO glad Jesse Cale recommended this song. I'm obsessed.
I was incredibly excited for this recording. But it would seem some studio person thought she needed her vocals layered. Please listen to the incredible live performance and stop trying to fix perfection... for fucks sake. Sorry for being a downer.
i can't wait to see her on the 28th. what an angel
ya boi is crying now
Slowly it start to sound similar...
well I just had 3:35 minutes of goosebumps
really wished I could have seen her open for jason isbell at the ryman the other night! she's amazing.
Beautiful song! Masterful video! Great job Julien and crew! Wish you all the best!
In portuguese, we have some expressions to descrive fellings, things, in this case music, that we fell like overwhelming. Its:«do caraças!». the music of little Julien Baker is... do caraças.
I hope she doesn't sprain her ankle with all that running.
I like how her latest 2 vids have just been her walking around singing
Y'all, I don't know if I'm emotionally prepared for this new album
There's so many reasons why it hurts to watch her perform and listen
She is something special
I'm not always like this, there's always tomorrow I guess.
The use of 35mm color film here is something from out of a dream. It’s subconscious and unreal. The shot of Julien coming out of the smoke before she starts running is my favorite.
I love her and so happy shes releasing new music.
I remember the first time I heard it live. Damn, I had goosebumps everywhere. I love that song. I love Julien. Can't wait for the new cd to come out.
Me vs Maradona vs Elvis. So much Brand New in this song. Love it
I like how the wire is not actually burning its way through the place, but is just being pulled while the end has a sparkling effect to it :D\nthis song tho <3
We need a song with Julien Baker and Dallas Green
in my Julien-trance, forever...
Oh my gosh! Even the sound of her footsteps in the beginning gave me goosebumps.
My god this woman can do no wrong. Simply amazing! Whoever disliked this video; FOR SHAME MAN!!!
She's an angel sounds so beautiful Love her voice gives me goosbumps
It's in 4:3 so you sure as hell no it's artistic ;)
Pretty awesome, at the end 2017 it was a good year 😍
Recently discovered Juliens music by accident. Now I need this album
I love every new song more than the last. The only downside of an artist like Julien is that every re-listen to one of her songs will never be as good as that first emotional journey, one where you could never be  sure of what was about to hit you. It still hits you of course, but I wish I could go into every song having never listened to it before.
Woke up to a notification about this video (southern hemisphere). DAY MADE.
Ouch oof owie my emotions
Goosebumps. Pure art. Oct 27th please hurry.
Magical sound
I just said goodbye to the plan for the day.
Julien can simply do no wrong
♡ !!
wow!
Beautiful
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
<3
test in accuse rmtcbc limb pilot media weather softly beginning.
I am crying.....again.
tears everywhere
I would die for Julien Bakers emo ass god damnit
I rejoice!!!!!!!!!!!!
</3
Your voice totally melt my heart
RAINHAAA DA BAD 💚
once again I clapped physical claps
1:53 - 2:08 Radiohead/Karma Police vibes
wow
beautiful song ❤️
wow.
Got to see her when she played in New Zealand! I'm hoping she tours this album here again, she's the best female artist in the world.
AHHHW WOW :O
Ofuk.jpg
holy crap! Although she writes kinda sad songs they always fit for every kinda mood....
Damn this is overall boring. The music is so slow and unoriginal and the lyrics try too hard to display significance...not to mention the video is just a number of cliched scenes edited together
When you hear that guitar in the intro you know it's gonna be fire
Man new music everywhere (Julien Baker, The Front Bottoms, Knuckle Puck, Beck) loving fall so far
wtf shes a crack
The mother Fucking GOAT. Best music I've heard in the last few years.
i'm not cry, i'm not cry 😢😭
Beautiful. A perfect song.
This video was shot next to my house
what camera is used?
Love it, love it....LOVE it!
i listen to julien when i'm having emotional breakdowns
How is she running after that sprained ankle?
what if she sing with dallas green?

Passion debuted at #13 on the New Alternative 40 Chart this week:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzJNg0BqA7A&list=PLxlSBzMcrtkMCVtuXEIz5BXpPfycTwsS5&index=13
Ahhhh AWOLNATION has gone and done it again!! This is insane and worth the wait, I can’t wait to hear what the album is going to sound like after hearing this masterpiece 😍😍
This is so good!!!
I care more about AWOL than my own future and certain family members.
Sweet, another great album coming up? Well done. it's been an honor to have been a witness to the evolution of AWOLNATION. Hope to see you soon in the Los Angeles County. Keep up the good work.
Amazing song.  Can't wait for the new album and tour.
Just googled Awolnation wondering what they up to and discovered this....GREAT!!
Seriously I've been waiting so long for this and this is everything and more I want!!!! I can't wait to see them again live!!! (I need this album like now!!)
I appreciate them putting Irontom in this
Love it! I feel passionate about this song! :) Dying to see them live!
S/O to the Irontom cameo in this video. ;)
I feel this album will take AWOL to the next level in regards to mainstream, and such. What a great song!
Cannot wait for new album :)
So good. Thanks Red Bull for continuing to give Aaron an outlet to share his musical genius with the world. Can wait to see this live.
Here at 20k!! Absolutely love you guys! Can't wait for the new album to drop! 😭❤👏
I've been waiting a year or so for new music from my favorite band and I was not dissatisfied 😍😍😍😍😍
I have passion about listening to this song everyday.
Glad to have new music
Does this Remind anyone else of the bohemian rhapsody video?
i have loved awolnation since before they were listened to on any public forum.  this video and song disturbs me.  :/
I loved that Irontom made an appearance. They need to your together again.
I love that this is kind of a mix of Megalithic Symphony and Run
THIS IS FUCKING AMAZING \nHOLLY MOLLY
THANK YOU THIS IS AHHHHHHH
I love Awol only band I'll ever preorder on vinyl and know its gonna be great
AWOLNation is back and better than ever!
IT FUCKING NEEDS TO BE IN THE NEED FOR SPEED UNDERGROUND 3!!!
How I can give 1 millions likes for this song?)
I remember this dude back in 2006 as the lead singer of UTIOG. Safe to say, he's progressed amazingly
THIS HAS BEEN STUCK IN MY HEAD FOR 4 DAYS STRAIGHT WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SO GOOD AARON
I love the new song already <3
I can’t stop listening, what’s happening
So does this mean therre will be a tour???????
When the album red bull
Nice jam.  Keep us the good work guys.
me no like
When does the new album come out??\n\nEdit:This sounds more guitar driven, like Awol's predecessors: Home town hero and UTIOG.
i started CRYING i have been a fan for so long!
SAIL
.
The outro is so friggin AWOL.  I love it.  Can't wait to someday see this song performed live!
I like it. Sounds great.
This was a very pleasant surprise, quite refreshed I'm excited to see more :)
Hated it when I first heard it but the main verse stuck with me and now I love it!!! It's so awolnation!!!
Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind.  Wow what a great song........
I freaking love love LOVE AWOLNATION and everything they put out
I like the original but it’s really awesome at 1.5x speed!
I hope this song gets on the fame and spot on the radio like sail did! I would love to see people appreciate awol more
хорошая песня вообще молодцы AwolnatioN
I'm glad that awolnation still has the same kind of music and didn't change, unlike other bands (cough cough 30stm)
It sounds like gorillaz and nine inch nails had a baby, i love it
First I heard it, I was skeptical. Then listening to it a few more times, it grew on me, as it says, it blew my mind!!!!! It's fucking awesome!!!!
a great sound, spinnin' it..
Tbh kinda disappointed with this track. Loved their last album. Hope to see this new one top it.
Only here for grace
Amazing!! I can't get this song out of my head now!!!

Mans getting a belly from bare chicken uno
Where's the school uniform and one glove look? I prefer it when you look like a clown. And when are you going to do something other than going to chicken and chip shops. If my son ate at chicken and chip shops like they were Michelin star joints I'd disown him.
these moroccans must be thinking what is a 12 year old doing here on his own
i thought you died
Bet he had the shits badly after this.
You need to go to the gym man, you getting big lmao

Where's your suit at
Tried too hard on thus episode tbh. The words, the effects, losing the original appeal
Why do people like this shit, it’s barely above most editing and it’s literally just reviewing chicken.
You don’t deserve a tv show you’re fucking shit
Man is looking more and more porky each video...
You've got to be so self conscious to delete fat comment😂
You should stop spending your money on chicken and chips, and go get a gym membership
Sell out
Shit hole country=shit food! Dummy!!
You died quick
Nigga please!
Looking a bit chubby still
mans getting chubby
My mans got big big

*คำเตือน* เหล่านกน้อยทั้งหลายย เรามีข่าวชั่วมาบอก เวลาฟังเพลง ต้องตั้งค่าค่าละเอียดเป็น 720 ยอดวิวมันถึงจะขึ้น #พึ่งรู้😢😢   เน็ตมันไม่ถึงง ส่วนใหญ่ ต้องปรับความเร็ว×2 มันถึงจะใช้เวลาไม่มาก ส่วนใครติด Wi-Fi ก็ดูได้ปกติ😢😢 #ไอ้ทูปกินเน็ตไปไหน แค่360ก้อพอ

Me: *googles* how many eyes do spiders have\nGoogle: Most spiders have eight eyes. Some have no eyes and others have as many as 12 eyes. Most can detect only between light and dark, while others have well-developed vision.\nMe: .......THAT'S RIGHT! MY SPIDER IS NOT LIKE MOST SPIDERS IT'S DIFFERENT AND HAS 4 FUCKING EYES.

When I watched the lava song I started crying.😅
Whoa what about the fact that they were designed after the famous Hawaiian Rights Activist who sang the famous cover of Over the Rainbow and his wife??
I feel like the only person who did like 'Lava' . . .
Partly Cloudy is always my favourite Pixar short, followed closely by La Luna!
No more amazing socks? NOOOOOOOOO! *in Claptrap's voice*
You should do a video on how Lava in connected to Moana. If it is at all contented
Aren't they also based on a real island?\nLike, the shot of them together at the end always struck me that it must be based on a real place, probably a volcano called The Lovers or something.\nNo? Just Me? Anyone?
Ukulele is basically Hawaiian for dancing fleas. Because the first people to play them had fingers that moved so fast that they looked like, well whatever dancing fleas look like.
i dont have a lava story sadly i wish i did tho
Awww can’t wait to hear more about your unborn son
What about the one with the old man anx chest
I wanna watch this but official lava song is recommended.
Here’s my thought on Lou being so low: Lou is the newest animatic out there with the movie it came before not even on DVD so a lot of people haven’t seen it. Since people haven’t seen it putting it up against another animatic most have seen isn’t exactly fair\n\n\n\n\n\nI also think having far less dialogue is WAY better than the lyrics that run Lava
Omg you have a son, congratulations
Why haven't I watched SuperCarlinBrothers in so long? I need to kick myself...
From what I've heard is that those two volcanos are based on Isreal something or other (Brother Iz is what they call him) and his wife or girlfriend... At least in their looks.
Not the socks!!!! Can't you guys like alternate or sell us more socks???
Lava is exactly like my life except I die alone and there is no happy ending. :,(
Can’t the turtles be kuru’s (from find Nemo’s) sons (or random kid-IDK)
Love super Carlin bros but every time I hear about the stupid kid I dislike the video
Honestly I'm not really a fan of lava. Idk why. Its just.... Not my favorite
Commenting before watching because I agree with this title
Listen, I think it's a really sweet little story. I do. But I can't be the only one that thought lava was a little... lame? \nAh I dunno, not my fave, anyway.
Geri's game still is and I think always will be my favourite Pixar Short it was probably the first 1 I ever saw and has ALWAYS been stuck in my mind
OMG I DIDNT KNOW YOU GUYS WERE HAVING A BABY CONGRATS MY FRIEND!! ❤❤❤
When u said u had a very sad announcement I thought u were quitting Super Carlin Brothers or like stopping for a little bit so u could spend time with ur wife and soon to be son
OMG UR GOING TO BE A DAD!!! I’m so happy for you J!
What place did day and night come?
I know Feast isn't technically a Pixar Short but you should talk about it!
It it brings me to tears. The love and wanting to be loved hit me personally. It was how I felt until I found myLele
The two volcanoes remind me of my grandparents. they got married when she was 18 and he was 21, and were together for over 60 years until she passed.
The little match girl 😭
LOL! I always have a real hoot watching your videos, though I havn't seen any in a bit, of course anything titled after LAVA would catch my attention! XD \nI Absolutely Love LAVA! I cried the first time I seen it in theaters, and then when I eventually showed it to my boyfriend (now husband), he cried too! XD so darn cewt dem volcanoes!\nAnyways we love singing it all the time, and then earlier this year when we found out we were pregnant, we knew our nursery theme INSTANTLY! Hawaiian Ocean. --But not just that! That mostly includes LAVA, Lilo & Stitch, and a little bit of Finding nemo.\nOf course we are going pretty far with a sea turtle theme now, but I am obsessed with wanting a huge picture of UKU & LELE over where the crib will be (SQUEE!) Of course I am working on that myself! But it will be so cute having those volcanoes sweetly watching over the baby!\n\nlol we are no where near even starting (nevermind completing) the baby room, but That is just my spiel on how much we loved LAVA too!!!  (Plus Uku reminds me a lot of my husband, who is a giant cuddly ball of mush XD  )
My Lava story: 1 days after meeting a, we were hanging out doing homework together outside. On my iPod, Lava began playing and I sung the chorus to which I heard another voice join me and sing the verses.He was singing with me. When it finished we both were amazed somebody knew and loved the song and it is one of the things which bought us closer together. We have been dating over 1 year now and it is one of our songs we sing together and listen to when we miss each other <3
None of these reasons are why it was the favourite.The video was pretty yet sad and the song was the sameThe end.
I lava him already hahahaha
Bro, lava is boss. Ukuleles. Where's my bois at?
Oh God, please don't get into top 10's. Too many of those. Stay original like you always are.
Bound almost came in dead last...?! How?! There is an emotionally supportive Jackalope!
lava sucks
So I watched lava again... Not into it but probably because I can't relate.
Yes Ukulele is pronounced oo-koo-le-le. And uku means lice/flea. Lele means to jump. So jumping flea. Which describes what the Hawaiian people saw when the Portuguese people brought the braguinha and played it for them. Fingers jumping around the fret board like fleas.
10 pfffffffffffffttttttttttttttttttttt more like 7 ; )
I'm sad that Paperman didn't make top 3, it's my personal favorite! I'm also surprised that Get a Horse! wasn't in top 3.
My friend randomly brought a ukulele to school and during lunch she played a beautiful rendition of Lava and everyone stopped to listen.
Aw man, I was expecting you to mention the Mexican volcanoes Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl, they have a legend about an Aztec princess named Iztaccíhuatl that is in love with a handsome warrior named Popocatépetl, and they swore to marry if he came back after winning the war against the Tlaxcalans. But Popocatépetl's love rival overheard this and, jealous, told Iztaccíhuatl that his fiancé had died in battle. Heartbroken by this lie, she died. Some time later, Popocatépetl came back victorious to find out that his future wife had died. He became depressed, and wandered for days until he found a way to honor her death: he piled up 10 mountains to make a grave, took the princess in his arms and gently laid her down on top of the giant mountain, he kissed her, took a torch and kneeled before her to mourn her eternal slumber. They have been together since that day and his heart still beats bright red with the love for his princess.\nI think it's a beautiful story and the Lava short reminded me of it when I first watched it c:
My favourite short is day and night
You talked about your son kicking and I automatically liked the video ❤
My favorite napkin story is Obi-wan writing his lightsaber plans on a napkin.
OH MY GOD I NEED TO SEE THE NEWBORN! MAKE A VLOG!
My Favorite short is Boundin'. I do not have a Lava story to share (but I love that short). Tournament ideas: Best Pixar movie, best Harry Potter movie/book, thins in the star wars prequels that sucks the least, best Disney song, and coolest movie character of all time.
It's pronounced Ookalaylee but it's been Americanized into Yukalaylee. So yeah, you're right to think you're pronouncing it wrong. also pronouncing ukulele in the proper way sounds like a pretty cool battle cry.
Falling in Lava.
Lava makes me feel 😢.
Lava actually made me cry.

Boundin' is my favorite....
#LiveLifeButtFirst\nOne of my favorite hashtags btw 😂
My favorite was piper
Awwwwwww
Meh. I don't think Lava is that great. Made it even worse when I saw Inside Out. The 2nd worst Disney Pixar movie! 😑
My favorite was the one about the guy in a desk job who was sad but ended up finding happiness and making friends and I just connect with it a lot.
@SuperCarlinBrothers. Ey! I think your video is cut off at the end... The vid needs some music! My songs might help youtube․com/XimerTracks
It could have been a turtle from Moana because Olaf will be in front of Coco so a mix of Disney and pixar in the shorts isnt unheard of.
Not going to lie I bawled when I watched this Short in theatres.
I've been waiting for someone who is worthy of my lava. I hope to be worthy of his lava too.....
Personally the first time I heard lava I teared up because I was lonely and wanted to meet someone and had given up because of past failures. But then I met someone later in life and now I can hardly remember being alone anymore.
Harry Potter question: We know that someone's Patronous and Anigmas animal are the same, because we were able to see McGonagall's Patronous. But if you change your Patronous, does you Anigmus change too?
piper yes it ain't any of your business.
This one is my favorite too.
If you want a place as a person... Hetalia
you should do a pixar movie tournament.
Are we not going to talk about the love of my life?! Israel “IZ” I-not-going-to-even-try-spelling-his-last-name?! He sang “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” and is the main inspiration to the song aspect of the short! He’s a large Hawaiian who looks like Uku and his wife looks exactly like Lele.
Nooo.....Partly Cloudy is the best one!
NO. BOUNDIN WILL ALWAYS BE THE BEST. BOUND. BOUND. BOUND AND REBOUND.
why did you stop the socks??????so sad
Who else thought he meant last video forever!
We sang this song in my choir class
Lava 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOT THE SOCKS
Slow da down!
Congrats on #41 on trending!

Pills debuted at #1 on the New Alternative 40 Chart this week:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwFx0ROBf7o&index=1&list=PLxlSBzMcrtkMCVtuXEIz5BXpPfycTwsS5
I didn’t see that it said 'audio' so I kept waiting for her to move 😂😂
Cara's voice is good :)
Discovered this woman by watching the Kate Bush documentary. I hear Kate Bush all over this work!
I’m seeing St Vincent tomorrow night omg!!
New St Vincent's lyrics are too direct and edgy for me.
Why does this sound like the pokemon red/blue song 'Guidepost' Love it!
3:08 - the lyrics are very reminiscent of Shine On You Crazy Diamond
Cara !!!
I'm not excited by this last material
Thanks NPR for turing me on to this amazing Artist!
Sup, dudes. I am currently run a blog entitled Come and Share This Jam With Me where I share underrated and simply awesome songs that I love like Pills, and where I also discuss my delightful opinions about them. If you want to check it out follow this link: http://sharethisjam.blogspot.com/2017/10/pills-st-vincent.html or not, that's cool too
The childish melody on the intro and the chorus reminds me a lot of the Pokemon games on the gba
I'm not sure how many know how great Annie Clark really is, but I do, this girl is one of the greats...
I love this so much
Ugh, why so many dislikes.  St. Vincent is amazing and always will be.
I really hated this song at first.
time for me to see, my guitar to think
Cum to think of it, she has a Jeff Beck vibe guitar tone going on. 😋
Brilliant. In every way.
This is like two awesome songs merged into one.
i miss st. vincent, i miss annie clark. digital witness was certainly the harbinger for a departure, but i am afraid, in this departure, there is no lift-off. (my opinion)   2:42 is a saving return-to-form, the rest is so done, so medium. No boundaries pushed, which coming from annie clark, is what I interpret as pandering. que lastima...
Pills pills pills and a big stiff dick pills pills pills
it's crazy that it's been 10 years since I first heard Annie. Been devoted admirer ever since. \nI don't know if anyone else hears this but this is for me is evolution of the kind of stuff Pete Townshend was writing during the Who's Sell Out & Tommy era\nI immediately heard that kind of funny-but-serious approach in the pills to... refrain, and the left-field spiritual slow jam of the ending. That's the Who, right there. I'm loving every second of it. If only John Entwistle was alive to play bass on this shit. Love you Annie 💚🎶🎸🎶💚
The last part sounds like a 90's song we had in Romania, i kept listening to it didn't know why it sounded so familiar. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSqILPaz1KU
does this remind anyone else of the underpants gnomes' song from south park?
pretty good timing for this song considering that the vegas shooter took anti anxiety pills that  drove him to psychosis
I don't even know if that's a bass anymore (what year is this?), but the responsible for it knows his stuff
The first song, New York...just didn't really do it for me. I love Annie for her insanely idiosyncratic angular approach to songwriting....and that song just didn't tickle my fancy. But seeing her perform Los Ageless on Colbert....and now hearing THIS, I'm now super thrilled for this new album. I mean, she never ever disappoints....and this new albums is looking to be even _more_ eclectic and surreal _and catchy_ than past stuff, and that's saying something. Annie is such a force of nature...what I especially love about her is that she's not only absurdly creative and smart...but she's a bit nuts, maybe more than a bit. That's a very crucial ingredient to making a truly interesting artist, or even just an interesting human being.\n\nPeople like Bjork or Bowie or Prince or Jack White or Michael Jackson....this list is long, although only representing a *_tiny_* fraction of humanity, those sort of artists are what I gravitate toward. People who are not only very talented and informed at songwriting....but who also have a few screws loose; artists who seem very self-confident and mentally sharp, but who also have a noticeable undercurrent of madness lurking beneath the surface. That's an important element of creative thinking and doing...and Annie has it in spades. She's very..._iconic_ to me...and I'm hugely inspired by Annie in making my own music and art.
The breakdown sounds like the Rain down... section from Paranoid Android to me... (a good thing)
the end half reminds me of Marry Me, and whatever happens before that gives me a seizure. I kinda like it. It feels like a solid blend between new and old styles. It reminds me a bit of The Apocalypse Song from Marry Me, and then Your Lips are Red, and then the hook is like a 1960's commercial jingle
Music of this woman is  absolutely Unique !!! 😍 I love it !!!! 😍
i love the part Cara sings
This is my happy pill!
I hate pills but I like this songs.
PILLS HERE
that rug is amazing.
The outro has bowie vibes 🖤
Yes
Annie bravo <3
I want to hear Mindless Self Indulgence do a cover of this
The beginning of the song sounds like that one Moana song tbh
I wouldn't need any pills to fuck her
Omg she is so sexy. Only girl I'd go gay for
Definitely my favorite so far from the singles released
I WANT TO MAKE SEXY TIME WITH THIS WOMAN NOW!
It kind of reminds me of Tune Yards
let alone find that kind of vocal range
I hear Pokémon\nI hear Queen\nI hear Bowie\nI hear Pink Floyd\nI hear St. Vincent !!
Wow, love the song! Check out this group Head Noise below too, pretty quirky electro-pop also :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDKts5guMOU
We Happy Few better use this song in their promo... It's literally perfect.
this sucks so bad that im' done with youtube for right now.
Hello! My name is Malik Charles and im really just tryna get support for my music! I write music about Love,pain and life..please take a listen https://youtu.be/JXZgl62f0dA
Ummmm this is so weird. It sounds like an ad St Vincent made. It is terrible and brilliant at the same time. The pills pills pills and a good stiff drink makes me nervous, but she redeems it towards the middle and the end with a classic rock structure. Maybe it'll make sense next to the other tracks.
Awesome song dead on commentary about how screwed up this society is and how we are all puppets of big Pharma.\n\nWhat one thing do all the shooters in all mass shootings have in common? They were all on multiple psychoactive prescribed drugs.
Am I the only one who hears life on mars at 2:50?
Annie, needs to do some work with Jamie Hince
i love this pic for.. reasons
Kind of Vampire Weekend 's vibe at some parts
Anyone else notice that Pink Floyd influence?
chorus is annoying, BUT DEAR GOD THAT SECOND HALF IS AMAZING! seriously that should have been the whole song. felt like modern day pink floyd
The melancholy finish is so Bowie Diamond Dogs/Low.
Not a very subtle message to this song.
I've never felt so ready for an album in my life.
Pills to follow Prof. Oak back to the lab
This song seems like to use for cheerleading or marching
AOTY
The outro interpolates ''Everyone You Know Will Go Away'', or the live song she played addressing mental health at David Byrne's show.\n(I am secretly SO happy for that)
I'm enjoying this new direction. It's not as heavy as the older albums. Better they try different directions and styles than stay stagnant trying to please fans who just want the artist to do the same thing again and again. Why can't people take a detour and try something different? Whether it's a different sound, visual or experience. There are always going to be some who stay in the past and are unhappy when artists change and experiment. And so what if St.Vincent wants to try performing on her own or offer a different experience? I'm glad when artists don't stay stuck just to please. Annie is trying something bolder, brighter and clearer. Observing different things now. Still staying true to her guitar. But I do understand sometimes people just don't dig something and that's fair enough. There's a beauty in difference of views and opinion.
I think we are listening an album about a beautiful talented musician girl who joined the high fashion scene and her thoughts about the things she finds ridiculous in it. Its just an idea though so we will see but It is ok beautiful girl, it is ok.. not everyone has the chance you have.. funny song though !
Why have I never fucked on purple carpet before... POWERFUL st Vincent!
I like this.
https://youtu.be/eB-CTk8oimc listen my band please!
On my zillionth listen now!
I'm so freaking hyped!!!!
me come
I hear Pokémon Red/Blue!
St. Vincent > Queen Bee
Annie is spitting rhymes. Awesome!
love it
Annie❤
Sounds fresh AF.
yawn
Sick
Much better than Los Ageless
Brilliant
ooooh
no disappoint me ever
St.vincent feat.Cara Delevingne
Sorry but it's annoying and generic
Really talented pop composer though, like brilliant ear for melody and tasteful guitar, the music kicks ass. It's just like 'rage against the machine' or some other kind of immature preachy bad self-important lyricism, i can suffer through most of it.
Why aren't her new music on vevo?
SHe's a boring person desperately trying to be edgy and avant garde
Firm flop into pop on this album. Lalala fafafa pillspillspills. She used to rock.
She said fuck

I've really liked the way this album has sounded so far, but the social commentary has been lack luster. I definitely think you should put it in your music, but what does saying anything about plastic surgery or Fucking pills have to do? Yes there are plenty of people who take pills who don't need them, but I'm disabled and in debilitating pain and I need them to get out of bed. I need pills to wake and sleep and fucking walk AND eat because of stomach issues. Medical science has come a long way and I'm HAPPY for it. This song is catchy but the lyrics are a snooze fest. 😴😴😴😴😴😴
I read somewhere that the Pills chorus has vocals by Cara Delevigne
i just nutted
Personally, I'm quite partial to the B line.
The West Coast Mainline
I have a new favourite customer at work. He came in about a quarter to closing time, and said 'I NEED YOUR CHEAPEST BIKE.' Lovely, goodnatured man, had been working since 2am and needed the bike asap so his son could get to work the next day. He was clearly stressed but didn't take it out on me or my colleague at all.
My favourite book right now is either Turtles All The Way Down or Songs About Us. Both are brilliant!!
Recently, one of my favourite songs has been What about by Janet Jackson, all thanks to you
I always feel guilty if I don't buy one of the products a sales lady recommends me, but I always do the I'll think about it deal and run away.
Where are you? Miss your videos. :-(
My favourite trainline is waikanae to wellington but that's in nz so you'll have no idea 😊 my favourite author is robin hobb 100000/10 recommend if you're into fantasy
my favourite train line would be the one that goes from London to Brighton that's such a nice one the worst is great western railway fuck them
AHHH omg my new best one is the film Pan's Labyrinth. Watched it for the first time today with school for film studies A level. I have never seen a film so aesthetically wonderful whilst also so technically brilliant and narratively stunning. I personally connected with it a great deal so that helped a lot-I was in tears most of the time. I adore the fantasy aspect and the historical setting but also love the darkness of it and how it is not just a (disturbing) fairytale but also the relation of that with the context of the Spanish rebels fighting the facist group after the civil war. That description was a mess. But I just really had a lot of feelings about the film.
Came back from Amsterdam today and although not a train line, it was the bus line that our driver lovingly called the “cocaine express”. One hell of a ride.
I like London Midland, free WiFi unlike Virgin.
I do love the DLR
I think the bakerloo line is underrated
The jubilee line is my fave tube line and Japan is my favourite country ever now having visited
Try the Gentleman's Bastards series by Scott Lynch. Basically Oceans Eleven meets Assassin's Creed. Warning the series is still ongoing, only 3 books out. But its so amazing. The way he writes is basically like he's painting movie scenes and dialogue is hilarious :D
I like the Inheritance series by Christopher Paolini. Extra info about it, it was originally intended to be a trilogy, but the world got so complex, along with  the characters, that it broke that oppressive system and became a four-parter. Mandatory reading for all humans who like fun and don't know everything. I love train line 2, in my city. It's the older one, and has far more interesting people on it.
Metropolitan because if you get the right train you skip some bits and get where you want to go much quicker! ;P
my favourite train line is the go transit lakeshore west line which means nothing to people that do not live in southern ontario but it is a good train trip 10/10. my favourite books include but are not limited to the night circus by erin morgenstern, she is not invisible by marcus sedgwick, and the rest of us just live here by patrick ness
I read All That She Can See by good ol carrie hope fletcher, absolutely loved it! Rewatched Black Mirror ultimate favourite and favourite film i've watched recently is probably Moana (i watched it again i love it so much). A favourite train line in wales cannot exist because Arriva are shockingly bad you wouldnt believe. I've been on the london underground once and literally can't remember any names so who knows
favourite train line is edinburgh to london kings cross, because whenever im coming to london its for something exciting - an interview, a visa appointment, a reunion with friends - london itself im not that fussed about but that train journey means im going to something not somewhere.
The Lobster is very much the same, perhaps darker, but I haven't seen the new film yet. Thanks for the vid, Dan! Oh also, the line from Providence to S. Station, Boston 😊
I recommend La Vita É Bella, if you haven't seen it, it is one of the most beautiful films in the whole entire world with comedy cleverly spread throughout... another good film is Hunt For The Wilder People, it's hilarious and you will be quoting it forever 😸
on the train to edinburgh, near the scottish border the train goes right next to the see and it always just fills me with a bit of warmth inside
Favs\nGreat British Bake Off\nEducating Greater Manchester \nRed Queen series
I have too many favorite books, but only one favorite train line. Portland Oregon Tri-Met Max Red Line.
Over summer, I went inter railing with friends. We were travelling between Vienna and Venice overnight, on a thirteen hour journey. There were three of us, along with two strangers, packed into a small cabin with three seats lining each wall. About half an hour into the journey, we discovered that each of the seats could be made to fully recline- in essence, the bum bit of the seat slid forward to allow the back bit of the seat to slide down and become horizontal. We did this with each of the seats, essentially converting the cabin into a great big mattress, the five of us lying parallel to one another trying to get some sleep.\n\nIt didn't work. I was really uncomfortable, and around 1 in the morning decided that enough was enough. I left the cabin and went and sat in the connecting bit between two carriages for a couple of hours, listening to music. Eventually, I felt just exhausted enough to maybe catch some shut eye. I snuck back to the cabin/bed, climbed over my friends, and tried to lie still, waiting for sleep to come.\n\nI managed maybe an hour of sleep, maybe a bit more. I zoned in and out of consciousness, noticing street lights dashing by in valleys far below us, and deducing that there must be so much Austrian countryside we were missing out on in the night. Sleep came and went for another couple of hours, until I came too and noticed that we were in daylight. I sat up, rubbed my eyes, and looked out of the window. My gasp was loud enough to waken the cabin.\n\nWe were in the middle of a mountain range as the sun rose, and the view was unlike anything I've ever seen. It was the most spectacular assortment of mountains and trees and snow and sun. It was the type of moment you imagine in your head, an unachievable fantasy that could never actually pan out. Like a moment in a John Green novel. An instant of pure beauty. And it was real, it was tangible. I could pull the emergency stop cord and run out and be in that view (I didn't). It was one of the most magical moments I can ever remember experiencing.\n\nThat's my favourite train line.
I could honestly watch your videos all day, your voice literally soothes me and your dry sense of humour really brightens me up, thankyou so much for being such a natural creator
Ooh I like participating\n\nI haven't seen it yet but I can tell Professor Marston and the Wonder Women is soon to be a favorite. And I've been listening to The Regrettes for the past couple weeks and they're incredible and I'd highly recommend if you want some good riot grrl punk fun
I have the same mask from The Body Shop and its wonderful
Okay so most importantly, I live in Perth and my favourite train line is the Fremantle Line, also known as the Blue Line so... that's fun.\n\nFavourite movie is 'Breakfast at Tiffanies' and if you have seen the film I recommend the book, get ready for a wild ride. I personally like the movie more, you'll see why. \n\nFavourite book is trickier because it depends on mood. If you want a good YA novel I recommend 'Six of Crows' and it's sequel 'Crooked Kingdom' by Leigh Bardugo. It's a heist novel but also not a heist novel... yeah. If you want just... fantastic, 'American Gods' by Neil Gaiman (I've only read the extended edition) it's brilliant. \n\nI liked this video a lot. :)
One that had me in tears was Flight by Sherman Alexie, who's a quality author btw
i’ve been jamming nonstop to the new ballparkmusic song ’exactly how you are’ it’s so nice and it makes me feel nice
Honestly, all I've really read this year are books related to Star Wars. Would highly recommend Lost Stars by Claudia Gray.
Has to be the Transpenine express
My favourite train line is the dlr because it has the least amount of sweat in the air, and also has near to no security, so when I'm broke I can just...jump my way in... >.<
the one that goes from Lichfield to London cuz its cheap as fuck buts its like the ryanair of trains and normally you have to sit on the floor or by the shitters so thats fun but it goes to euston which is better than all the other pretentious and expensive train stations in the middle of bumfuck in London -cough- st pancras
My favorite book at the moment is ‘walking the underground overground’ which u recommend ages ago. I really enjoyed reading it and learning so much. The book doesn’t just tell you facts about the tube lines and its stations but also gives you a new perspective on how to view London and it’s hidden treasures. Living in Australia I have had the lucky opportunity to visit London and I wish I had read this book before I visited. Because instead of taking the underground to the places I wanted to visit I wish I walked around the city more and see these diamonds in the ruff. I loved London and I hope to go back one day and visit some of the places mentioned in the book. I also highly recommend the book to anyone!!!
I'm so jealous of the uk/America.... everybody is complaining about summer ending and winter starting. I'm sad because I can't remember a single day that it rained this winter. I want winter back I'm moving to the UK for 6 months
Blade Runner 2049, First sequel i've ever seen as good if not better than the First, fallout series, i love video games i love sci fi and post apocalipse YouTube, it's been a lovely few months, october i love cold months i can't stand heat. Andddd movies in general as always
My best ones this month have been The Book Thief and Rick and Morty...quite opposite tones. Says a lot about my brain atm.
my favourite train line by far is the line from bristol temple meads to reading. sometimes late but a good solid relaxing journey, often not too busy despite being over an hour, some pretty countryside to look at. 8/10\n\n\n\n\nalso wth are you doing with a hillary book dan. ew
My favourite train line is the central line, super continent to get from my house into central London. Highly recommended 8/8, 6 stars, 100% reliable
Oh my god! I didn't understand that you said 'colder months' i thought you were talking about some Game of Thrones thing called coldemonts 😂😂😂
I've seen Blade Runner 2049 at the movies the other day and it was mind blowing. I am so affected by it... IT'S SO GOOD
My favourite train line is the steam train that runs between the coastal village of Swanage and the even smaller, cobblier village of Corfe (which has an awesome castle next to it). It's all very picturesque and lovely there. Thank you for asking.
You asked for it, so here goes - my favorite train line is the regional train from Leipzig to Chemnitz (both in Germany).
Did you say favourite train line? Because in all seriousness, there's a line known as the Heart of Wales line which goes between Cardiff and Holyhead, but the only bit I've been on is (ironically) the English bit from Hereford to Shrewsbury, and it's got some darn lovely views.
I'm really enjoying bus 12 at the moment, it goes from Utrecht central station to the university and it's so so so crowded. Almost everyone hates it but I think it's so amazing, you see the most interesting people, you hear the most crazy stories and I sometimes make friends for like ten minutes and then never see them again
As I've just started my gap year of doing odd jobs and figuring out what I wanna do with life (lol) I've started compiling lists of books and films I should read and see. Top of my books list are gone girl, the handmaid's tale and the bluest eye, although I recently bought Rest In Power (a book written by Trayvon Martin's parents about his life and death) which I'm quite eager to read. I finally watched Arrival the other day an loved it and am meaning to watch Hacksaw Ridge and all Star Wars because I haven't actually watched any of them all the way through (Ik I'm sorry). Also got a tv show list and next up is Westworld...This is a real long comment I hope someone actually finds it interesting lol
I don’t have a favourite trainline... now I want one
My current favorite thing to watch (besides you and josh giving me almost daily content) is drunk disney by practical folks! It's really fun and light hearted and I'm just really enjoying the easiness of it
Favourite thing at the moment is King Arthur. That movie was incredible; I was thinking about it for days after seeing at the cinemas and once I'm done planning the blocking for the play I'm directing (send help, please) I'm going to reward myself by getting it on dvd.\nFavourite train line is the airport line (usually not going to the airport when I use it though - usually going to concerts at the Opera House!). Much nicer than the train line that's actually the closest to my house.
I LOVE that mask! Wish I could use the others but I'm allergic :( instead I use Lush masks instead
If you're a hygge fan 100% come to Denmark - I thought the whole hygge craze in the UK was just capitalism capitalising on some random concept that doesn't really exist but Danish people LOVE hygge and are always trying to make situations more hygge. For example, in the University of Copenhagen Library there are free blankets you can borrow to wrap yourself in while you do your work! It's the best, Denmark is a cool place.
House Of Cards mate. That is the current favourite. What a show. Also What Happened was great, but made me extremely angry and upset all over again. I JUST WANTED HER TO WIN OKAY (still not over it)...
If you haven't seen/read it I would recommend The Handmaids Tale in both book and TV form
My favourite train line is the Joondalup line but that would mean nothing to you haha A really good book I read recently is The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead.
bakerloo line forever. also i'm reading The Power by Naomi Alderman and thoroughly enjoying it
Tube line? The Victoria or the overground \n\nIf you’re not talking about London, I like the sky train in Vancouver... but I’m a bit biased. ;)
My favourite train line is the Kapiti line from Wellington Station to Waikanae
my favorite train line is either the Corona or Hargita Lines that go between Budapest and Brasov, passing through the best pockets of Transylvania and Székelyföld.
Dan, I'm sure that soup is delicious and I myself and psyched for soup season.. but frankly, and I'm sorry, it looks like you're eating a bowl of shit
can you please talk about what happened  when youve finished it?
right now it’s my summer doona as i’m in australia. haven’t been out of bed for a few months because depression but i love this doona.
my alltime favourite book is I'll Give You the Sun by Jandy Nelson and its INCREDIBLE. ive read it three times and marked my copy to hell and back. cannot recommend it enough
Eyy! I made potato and cheese soup today because it got cold enough :D I'm quite the opposite, I enjoy the cooler weather much more than the warmer months. I like the warmth, but only for a short time. I don't like being hot and sweaty :/ I like cozying up with a blanket, a book, a cup of tea or coffee, and a pet (preferably a cat). I can't wait for snow and more baking and cooking!
are you sure winter is coming?  i'm not.  you prefer the summer months?  april thru october possibly thru november possibly thru december possibly forever.  damn what ISN'T a summer month at this point?  come here, you'll have a blast at least until ya get heatstroke in the deep south united states.  this place will cook you like roast chicken.
Can't believe you didn't ask about favorite soup! After that whole intro! I'll tell you anyway. I made a delightful cauliflower green curry soup last night that was very much in the spirit of hygge.
I'm a pretty big fan of the Gold Coast line
I'm rereading The Martian cos it's so heckin good. also rewatching stranger things. I should probably try to consume new entertainment but. The Martian. so heckin good.
Does anyone else constantly want to run their fingers thru Daniel’s hair?
Isn't hillary extremely corrupt? She constantly changes her stances e.g. gay marriage just to win votes, she's known to be in the pockets of big powerful companies?
My favourite book and movie haven't changed since I was 10 (which is Harry Potter and Nightmare Before Christmas respectively). Don't know what that says about me as a person considering at age 24 my favourite things are still the same as they were when I was 10 :/
I don't put it on my beardy bit oh Daniel, you wonderful human!
When you're taking a break from studying Brecht and Mother Courage, to watch a Daniel J vid where he references BRECHT
Daniels videos always make me feel so calm and welcome and warm...omg his videos are the soup of youtube vids!
I like steam engines not because of the pollution but because of the industrial revolution occurring and inspiring creativity
if you haven't already: HIdden Figures.
love the northern line.
Well the Milton line, I guess. not that Go ever gives it good service.
i like london midland bc their trains are clean and well spaced out and USUALLY not too busy. also enjoying my bedding i got for uni from matalan (its sO soft) and this charcoal and bamboo face wash by t-zone (really cheap and good for oily skin, if you're a student buy it in superdrug bc they do student discount if you have unidays)
I love a good Jubilee line ngl
Genuinely spent a few minutes wondering what my favourite train line is .... tbh Hull Trains going anywhere wins because hometown pride and that
Current favorite train line: Northern, because it was basically the main one I have used this past month (ie: the only month I have ever been in London).
Me: what are caldamons, is that something from Game of Thrones that I forgot about? ...  Oh, wait. caldamons, warmer months, colder months, warmer months....
My favorite ones...AVATAR the last airbender because I've been binging it again and it's glorious and I've made peach cobbler, pecan cookies, and apple muffins this week. My kitchen is well stocked and I got promoted yesterday. There's a crap ton of wildfires that's making the air awful and scary (I live in Northern CA right where the fires are happening) but a lovely breeze came this afternoon and swept it all away. LIFE IS GOOD. Food is amazing. Dan Howell uploaded a fantastic video today. What more could a girl want
Favourite train line...Southern.
~Things I Live For~

Favourite movie - Pride (2014) soooo good
I genuinely thought you very nonchalantly said the soup was 'carrot, *human*, and kidney bean' and got very confused
I think this is a good camera angle for me
Josh, I'm honestly wondering how, at this point, you don't burst into laughter at your own jokes. Like, that in itself is impressive.
this was crap
“oh yeah he’s a crisp man”
is this whole series just an elaborate excuse for Josh to introduce us to amazing music? cause boi, i'm in
hey josh this is so great i love you youre doing amazing sweetie
jack screams when he laughs it's a lot

I actually love these videos😂
I've never seen such a fair game show?? How are you such an impartial judge?? Honestly inspiring😍😍😥
Who am I to argue with... logic

I'm going to be so upset when VIDEO is over
jack’s laugh > everything else

When I was around 13, the meaning of food suddenly and rapidly changed. I realized that I didn't look like every other girl and the idea hasn't really ever left my mind. I am not comfortable with people commenting on anything that I eat, I eat emotionally and when I'm not hungry. I prefer to eat by myself, and when I am around other people I'm very aware about how much everyone else is eating compared to me and if anyone says anything at all about my food that could be seen as negative, I lose my appetite and don't want to eat anymore. I struggle everyday with my feelings towards food, but hearing people talk about how they got over their issues with food helps me a little in trying to fix whats going on inside my head.
I admire you so much....i am 69, and been vegan for 9 months and have lost 47 pounds.  I wish i had figured out some of these things when i was your age.  You rock!
I'm so happy you made this video. I've always been chubby and struggled with food and my weight. Videos like this make me feel less alone. 💜
10/10
I can relate to this very well.  I was 7 when my grandfather started making advances towards me.  My parents were divorced, my dad mia and mother was in the navy.  I turned to food to cope with what I was going through.  I turned 18 and found out I had PCOS, a genetic disorder that makes it difficult to loose weight due to imbalanced hormones.  My relationship with food has been a constant war every day for 22 years.  I was anorexic, bulimic and obsessive compulsive with food.  It has been the longest  battle in my life.  Some days it feels all consuming.  I tried going vegan but found it triggered my ocd.  Thank you for sharing your story,  it's always heartwarming to hear similar stories from the other side.
Please be honest to yourself, If you have Cats and Dogs they still need food with meat and if you take or ever need any Medical procedure or medicine they also exist due to a lot of animal tests and pain, so you CAN'T disconnect as you think. Don't fool yourself. You not helping animals being a hypocritical human.
You are so inspiring Kiera, I love watching you videos 💖
I can really relate to you. From the year or so I've been watching your channel I would have assumed that you'd always been thin. I think you're beautiful and intelligent... even more so now that I see how alike we are.
Great to hear your story <3 I'm sure a lot can relate somehow to what you've told us now, I know I can. You should feel proud of yourself, you've done an amazing job
You have shown us all that it is still very difficult. You say that you didn't want to talk about food on your channel but it really is one of the reason why all of us are here, we listen to you and look up to you, you are beautiful inside and out and you have inspired me to be better and helped me become Vegan. Please keep going and continue with this channel and talk about yourself and food, its brilliant! You're brilliant!
Hey try this before they are all gone! I had AMAZING success losing weight with garcinia extract. It burns fat, gives you energy and stops you from being hungry all the time. Well today is the last day they are giving away trial bottles. Grab one while you can before they are all gone here: http://www.getyourdeal.club/free/1DayGarciniaOffer
Hey Keira ❤️ thank you so much for this video - it hit home a lot for me as I've also struggled in the past (and I continue to even now)! About your What I Eat videos... please don't listen to the negative comments. These videos actually really helped me with my journey towards veganism because I saw how realistic your diet was. It was nothing too fancy, nothing expensive... I remember watching once of your videos where you do a vegan Tesco shop and I remember thinking wow actually it looks really easy to be vegan! You just buy more vegetables!. So yeah, it made the vegan diet seem much more do-able for me and is probably one of the bigger things that helped me push forwards in the right direction with my diet/morals :) I'm super glad you are feeling better about everything and I hope you continue to feel better every day :)
What a brave thing for you to do. I really appreciate your honesty and I'm so happy to hear you're feeling so much better. My ED has the tightest hold over me. It's videos like this one that give me hope that one day, I too can be happy within. Thank You so much. Xxx
I related to this so much. Thank you for making this video 💖
Eurgh I love you. Thank you so much for you being you!! 🍄
I found a lot more things that I would eat at others peoples houses too!
Going vegetarian has made me be way less of a picky eater. I am way more willing to try new foods.
thank you for this video keira, you're the best!!
Veganism changed my relationship with food too! And I'm so grateful to you for recommending the minimalist Baker as I can finally cook 😂. After hating exercise my entire life I have now joined a kickboxing gym and the impact it has had on my mental health is amazing. I feel the best I've ever felt, a workout works better than any anti depressant I've ever taken and I can't believe it!
I would have never known this side to you💭 thanks for sharing🙂 You are definitely one of the reasons why I started thinking more about vegan choices/ meals, and why I one day want to transition completely into that eating lifestyle !x
I really struggle trying to be Vegan and working full time 😔😔
Can I just say you are look absolutely stunning!!!! Thank you so much for this video. I’ve been struggling with food and my since I had my son 9 months ago, I’m vegetarian but because I’m so busy with my son and work I find it easier to just eat crap like a bag of crisps. But your video has inspired me to eat more fruit and vegetables and home cooked meals.
Aw Kiera! Thank you so much for sharing your story. Though you and I had different journeys (duhhhh different people), I feel exactly the same about veganism. It was like as soon as I started eating vegan, all the other problems I had went away. I stopped wanting to be thinner, restricting, calorie counting and just eat whatever I want, when I want. Everyone’s always saying how good I look physically, though I do regularly exercise now too. If you want any tips on how to get the ball rolling on exercising on the reg pls let me know. Sending love to you and Alex xx
Nothing better, or healthier, than a delicious, juicy sirloin steak from a 7 week+ hung side of beef.
I love your food videos ! They motivate me so much to eat better & to cook more & I love seeing meal ideas !
I ❤️ you so much Kiera ❤️❤️
What a brilliant video Kiera, huge respect for you for opening up about something so personal. I’ve had huge up and downs with food and my weight and have chronic ibs which makes things even more difficult! Have been wanting to go vegan myself for a long time but with ibs it’s extremely difficult and I haven’t found a way yet. Our relationships with food are such a complicated thing and the focus is always on weight loss above everything so thank you for talking about it from a different angle.
I too find it so hard  to motivate myself to exercise! It'd be great if you could share your journey when you get started ... it really is a mountain to climb ... Does Alex exercise? It's lovely he became vegan with you. Thank you for your videos!
I don't eat fruit. I eat pretty much all veg, but can't get over the fruit mental block :( hopefully one day
I adore you. And I love your what-i-eat-in-a-day videos so much more than most others, because they include a variety of foods of all kinds.
Thank you for producing such an honest video about food. I too had a big problem with textures of food growing up and it is nice to hear someone talking about it! I completely agree than Minamilist Baker is a life saver - has opened my eyes as well. I have only been vegan for 4 months now and have been enjoying getting to know you through your channel. It takes a lot of courage to go online and talk about these things and I really respect you for having the confidence to do so.
I didnt get my weight loss ca. 1,5 years after I went vegan. All the other people mentioned it to me and they still do. Sure, I realized I could downsize my wardrobe here and there in the sizes I needed to buy. I still don't weigh myself. That's what I stopped since I moved out from my parents house. Avery helpful video. Thank you Kiera. All the love. <3
Wow this helped me a lot and opened my eyes. I'm vegetarian and I stress over a lot and I found myself gaining weight rather then losing it. Then again my diet isn't the greatest.. but you've inspired me. I honestly always wanted to go vegan and I will get there one day but thanks for inspiring me!❤️❤️❤️
Just found you through this video loved it I wish I wash brave enough to talk about weight mental health and veganism on youtube but I love watching videos about it 💗
I think your food videos are really awesome! You show that you can eat what ever tasty food you want when you go vegan and you're not hard on your self and you show it for what it is, delicious! Anyone who's is vegan and promoting it is admirable. Not everyone needs or wants to be a health guru. You do you!! You're doing great work.
oh my god, thanks a lot for sharing.
Veganism is so beneficial in so many different ways!\n\nLoved this video <3
You look So gorgeous in this video!
Thank you for sharing this, Kiera!\n\nI used to struggle with eating disorders and when I'm in a bad place in my life, they would come back to haunt me. I recently made a big decision of following a long oppressed dream (becoming an artist) and everything immidiately clicked in place, including my relationship with food. I feel like eating disorders are often (at least for me) only the symptom of something else, something that - as you said - cannot be put into words, cannot be understood. So the ED becomes a cooping mechanism.\n\nRealizing this and turning my life around helped a great deal. Also educating myself on food in general and cutting meat and most of processed food out of my diet made me awere of my health more. Following you here and watching your food related videos always make me feel more confident and happy! :D I'm not vegan, but I love how you show the world that veganism is not some kind of elite lifestyle for the priviliged, but something normal that can be enjoyed by anyone. :) Thank you! ^^
My cat came to sit with my when I clicked on your video. Kind of sweet :)\nI (like so so so many others) have struggeled with food from a young age. I'm 29 and I'm still not OK with it, but since going vegan it's gotten better. I focus more on health than on weight and slowly but surely I think I'm actually heading somewhere :) \nThank you so much for sharing. You're such a wonderful and inspiring human being xx
Self defence classes? Hell yeah, become more like Xena!
I love this. I relate to this so much and I can say right now, my relationship with food is not the greatest. No one would even consider me fat but I was very overweight when I was younger and I still tend to feel like a little fat girl this was inspiring.
I had a very similar experience with food, I hadn't eaten onions until I was about 17 and only tried courgettes this year! I do not like a lot of food textures and I have a lot of food aversions! It was really nice listening to someone else talk about this The environment I grew up in wasn't good, and I was fed nothing but chicken nuggets and chips and other freezer food, when I moved in with my other parent at 14 it was mad, I'd never really seen fresh vegetables in my home before that and it's been such a long journey to start eating properly and enjoying food! Cooking is a big part of my life now and I also find it very therapeutic! I recently got into exercising, an I've been doing the wii fit aha, retro I know, but it's nice exercising when nobody can see you!
Thank you for this video. My eating disorder history is different but it is nice to see that you have gotten better and made progress. Seeing you talk about it and how it got easier is really encouraging.
Thank you so much for this video. I'm on my own journey to resolving my life long issues with exercise and food and it is so inspiring to see someone who has gone through simillar struggles and has come so far. No matter how many videos I watch of super healthy exercise and diet people I watch I never know where to begin but your channel actually makes it seem possible. Thank you for showing me that I'm not alone.
Ah I’m so proud of you! (And Alex!) thank you for sharing this with us 💕 you’re so amazing and definitely continue to inspire me. I’ll forever love your videos, super chill and feels like I’m hanging with my friend ❤️ (I’ve stuck around since your red hair days! And your pink/ purple fringe and blue hair days lol) so glad you’ve stuck with YouTube. Thank you 😊 much love 💕
This video made me tear up. Your story is very similar to mine, wow. I did eat more of a variety of foods at home as a child, but still did a lot of overeating. The part where you talk about being a great student but still dreading school, being very introverted, wondering why you couldn't be like the other kids, was me as well. I'm in the process of making the switch to vegetarianism right now. Two months in, and I thought it would be hard, but I've been figuring out lots of recipes that I love which makes it easier every day. ❤️ (And trying to refrain from putting cheese on EVERYTHING 😅.) Anyway, thank you for sharing your story. ❤️
Thank you for talking about it. It is really meaningful for me.
I've been subscribed to you for years now. I relate to you on so many levels. This video however just blew my mind. Our stories are so unbelievably similar. Thank you for  being brave enough to share your experiences. And thank you for normalising and demistifying veganism as much as you do. You, and your videos, are very much appreciated ❤️
you're hair looks amazing!!! it really compliments your face <3
I don't know if you will get to read this because there are so many comments already! I really relate to what you're saying, I was underweight because I couldn't eat when I was stressed, which was all the time pretty much. I struggled with food because of textures too! Also, when I started up a relationship, with who is now my husband, everything changed for me. He was so encouraging and ate so many different foods, and there was no pressure to like them. If I didn't like a vegetable he would ask why and find something else I might get on with, or suggest cooking it in different ways like roasting broccoli for example. I don't eat perfectly but feel so much healthier, I'm happy with my weight and have alot more confidence in myself. My point being that you've done amazingly, and I can really appreciate the progress you've made
Maybe try trampolining classes for fitness? Could be really fun and a great throwback!
Thank you for making this video Keira! \n\nyour food videos have always been a big help to me, reminding me how important it is for me to be chill about food, eat that ice cream, try that fake cheese ect \nveganism has also done so so much for me in repairing my very broken relationship with food
I so know the feeling. For years I've been struggling with weight loss my weight going always up an down. That is until almost 10 months ago I went vegeterian and like you said tried out a lot of new foods like lentils or all kind of veggies. Sure enough without even  focusing on it I slowly over the months lost some weight. I don't really like the scale so I only noticed It when my clothes especially pants felt looser and people started mention it. It really is a feeling from within it just feels right. A healthier mind got me a healthier body that I'm slowly accepting for what is :) - loved hearing of your story and experience. You show food in a very natural and easy way that I think a lot of people understand better myself included 😊
I can relate to this so much I've grown up as the most awkward fussy eater, my mom would always cook me my own separate dinner without any veggies in cause I hate certain textures. It's got so bad that me and my partners friends won't invite us out to certain restaurants because they worry I will not be able to eat anything on the menu 😞 I feel like I really need to be open minded to trying new foods especially fruit and veg. I'm really glad you did this video it made me feel like I'm not the only one who has food struggles ❤
Great video! I was also a very plain picky eater as a kid (only ate white food i.e. Chicken and potatoes) so I can relate a lot! I started being more adventurous with food (also as a result of meeting my boyfriend) and now I love trying new things my family are constantly amazed at the change 😜😜 have you tried any recipes from Monami Frost's vegan cookbook?
You look extremely beautiful always. and i think you are a great person
Thanks so much for sharing your journey with us! :) \nI felt the same when I went vegan - I lost some weight, but I gained a whole new world of delicious food, compassion, knowledge and I feel the best I've ever felt - the weight is just a thing that happened along side that!
Great video! It was so interesting to learn more about your lifestyle. Thanks for sharing. :)
Thank you for sharing your story. It is a brave thing to do and it's a brave thing to share what you eat to the world especially if you've struggled with food in your lifetime because people can be really brutal online. Here you are not hiding behind a veil like the people who judge you are and putting yourself out here and it's really inspiring. I love to hearing that despite the judgement you recognize your own personal achievements like eating a variety of foods. I can't tell you how much this really does help. You seem like such a sweet person and I really enjoy your videos and hope you enjoy inspiring others with what you make.
Thanks for sharing your journey! Sorry you suffered a traumatic event that affected you so adversely! Just look at how far you’ve come!! Be kind to yourself!! Love your channel!
Veganism has also changed my life! It's so lovely when things fall into place. Thanks for sharing your story. It resonated with my own story so much.
At 21 years old I’ve never met or even heard anyone else being so ‘fussy’ with food like me. For as long as I can remember I’ve struggled with the textures of food and in consequence have a really basic diet, also being vegetarian that doesn’t even eat fruit and veggies is practically unheard of lol. It’s so reassuring hearing that you’ve managed to overcome this your self and gives me hope for the future that I can do this myself
Awww Kiera. I still remember asking if you were vegan a long while ago and you said you weren't yet. Your journey is amazing. So many animals saved. You look so beautiful , you always have quite frankly...oh and the grown out fringe definitely becomes you! <3 from Long Beach, CA USA
Food has controlled my life. I've always been an over eater. After lots of therapy I realised I was an emotional secret eater. It stemmed from my parents break up and propelled by an abusive relationship.\n\nI'd found myself having secret weekends of eating. I had a process; all takeaways, eaten from the tubs (eating from the plate made it 'real food') and then throwing it in the outside bin. I would be on the verge of vomiting. After 48 hours of snap out of it and spit out my food and go back to normal.\n\nI gained so much weight and was so unhappy. It wasn't until I started therapy that I realised that I associated food to being happy, especially the Friday night takeaways with my family before mum and dad broke up. Main food was fried chicken, and I'd eat a lot of it. \n\nTwo years ago I went veggie and felt like I had some control. Then earlier this year I got ill. It's taken me months to work out what was wrong. Turned out that I have fat malabsorption (which causes horrid side effects). The theory is that my years of consuming high fat foods then stripping it back repeatedly ruined my gastric system.\n\nI'm now vegan and on the road to healing. I still have my moments when I just want to eat and eat and tell no one, but I'm open about it and tell my fella. Being not so secret about it make it easier to control.\n\nKeira - thank you for being so honest. You're honest and have no shame and it means that people like me can be honest too. \n\nLove you x
Oh my god this video was so personal thank you for sharing 💗 your thoughts from childhood were so heartbreaking but comforting at the same time to hear someone else feel the same. I'd like to think that if our younger selves knew each other, they would have been pals 💗
Such a lovely and inspiring video...I can really relate to your story and struggle. Well done on getting so far! Xxx
Great video Kiera! Talking about food and diet on here (especially if you're vegan) can be so nerve-wracking! I used to be a pretty picky eater myself but once I cut out meat from my diet I was sort of forced to try so many new things - most of which I really enjoyed! I follow Dana too, she's so unbelievably helpful. ohsheglows is pretty amazing too ^_^ Hope you and Alex had a lovely anniversary!
thank you for sharing your story <3\ni've also struggled with food my whole life, had anorexia as a teen, but now that i'm vegan (been vegan for 14 months) my symptoms have lessened significantly, i feel a lot less guilty about eating and have managed to maintain a healthy & stable weight - i think the knowledge that i'm making a difference by eating plant-based really helped me feel better about food\ni've also been going to therapy which has helped, and figuring out the root causes for my mental health issues has given me so many tools to improve
you look beautiful and your so brave x
You are an amazing person Kiera!!! Keep on being fab x
You are the only person that helped me stop feeling ashamed of being a size 16 because I think you are so unbelievably beautiful and it helps me think that I might be beautiful too ❤
Anyone who would dis your diet or lifestyle or tear apart your daily menu must be extremely disillusioned by something that has absolutely nothing to do with you, personally.  Every video you make is honest and non judgmental to anyone out there. Why there are people out there in the www (is that an old term?, I'm over 50 yo so sorry if I'm not up to date), who seem to seek out reasons to hurt people are doing well in their lives? Hopefully these few ( and I sincerely hope they are few) who feel they must take time out of their day to make disparaging remarks about ANY of your videos will soon realize that it's not YOU or anyone else but THEY who have a problem. Sorry to go on for so long.
so important! amazing video hun x\ni've noticed it's quite common for many people that after going vegan their relationship with food changed. \nin my case...I don't want to say that I forgot about my ED but it just....I don't know, different things started to be more important and I was just so excited about foods? With trying new things - high five. As a kiddo the only veggies I ate were chips and mushrooms. Maybe cauliflower. And now? Look at me! For dinner today I had bowl of SALAD bigger than my head :P\nI'm so happy that you're doing better and that you having back control over what's happening :*\nLots of love :*\n\nalso - vegans judging other vegans over who's more vegan - GTFO\nanimals don't care if you eat raw till 4, if you're frutarian, if you juicing all day or if you stuff your face with mac n cheese. As long as it's vegan, you're good to go!
You are #22 trending! Really interesting video I went vegan almost two years ago and it really changed the way I thought about food. Also it helped with binge eating (for me chocolate) when things aren't vegan I have absolutely no desire to eat them 👌🏽
this video was so honest and real and from the heart <3 thank you for sharing Kiera, you'll have helped so many xo
I SPY A NEW PLANT BABY!
I agree with other commentators that if you want to exercise more, then find something you LOVE! ^____^ I started hula hooping/ hoop dancing almost 2 years ago, and I love it so much because it is FUN and creative! :) And as a circus skill, anyone can learn it, all it takes is practice!  \nThank you for this video, even if if was super hard for you to do, you did a great job, and you are making me more and more interested in becoming vegan! ^____^ X
YOUR HAIR LOOKS SO GOOD
I hadn't eaten all those vegetables or really ANYTHING either until I went veg and pretty much forced myself into it
*you should try proper working out*\n*i used to hate it when i started myself pretty late in life, but then i learned to love it!*\n*most things in life we don't like when we're not good at them, but no one is good at anything he has never tried*
I bloody love your what I ate videos. I think it shows what real life is like and that not everyone is a health nut. Vegan ism personally isn't for me but I think your videos also show that veganism isn't just a bunch of salads all the time. You're looking fabulous and as long as you are happy then that's brilliant 👏🏻💕
I think everyone in the comments will hate me for this but... In one of your really earlier videos I did make a comment to you about my concern that there was a lack of vegetables and fruit and now I really regret what i wrote, I wasnt trying to be rude I thought I was trying, in my weird way, to look out for you. I thought I was being helpful, but wasn't aware of the issues you faced, so I want to take this moment to apologise, I'm sorry and I really hope that I didn't offend you.
<3

It’s nice to see a vegan, and I know not all vegans are like this but they do exist, who doesn’t force veganism down non vegans throats because they see it as a superior way of life when they a lot of the time themselves are restricting their diets so much they have border line eating disorders that are not healthy and sustainable in the long run. She just seems to natural and real like a normal vegan with a diet that is healthy and makes her happy, it’s nice. Sorry for the paragraph just thought I would say 😂
Ah white ppl problems\nIf I was middle class I'd make more important videos

#YIAYpoint:\n\nPHILIP PULLMAN NOVELIST\nHere we are, alive and conscious, in a universe that seems to be made of material things like atoms and quarks and Higgs bosons and so on, which are undoubtedly there but possess enigmatic, ghostlike properties that are hard to grasp, such as entanglement and the wave/particle duality. What are we to make of it all?\nI start with consciousness. I am certainly conscious, and I’m equally certainly made of matter; so I conclude that matter is capable of consciousness, and there’s no need to make up a thing called a soul to do the consciousness while the dull, inert, clod-like body does the carrying around. I’m certain that animals are conscious, and I see no reason to deny a form of consciousness to plants too. Don’t they sense where the sun is, and turn towards it?\nHumans and animals and plants are alive, though. Perhaps consciousness depends on being alive, and not just on existing. Surely stone, air and water aren’t conscious?\nI’m not so sure. It’s not hard to imagine that consciousness might be a normal property of matter, like mass. Thanks to the Higgs boson and its associated field, we now know how mass exists. Maybe there’s another field and another particle, as yet unsuspected, which deal with consciousness. Maybe what we call dark matter and dark energy are aspects of that very field. Or maybe not. But when by chance complex structures like the human brain evolve, consciousness is able to think about itself, and reason, and imagine, and empathise.\nThat sort of self-reflexive consciousness is a good thing. The more of it there is, the better we’re able to understand and create and be kind. So here I come to what the point is: the point is to bring about more consciousness. By teaching, or doing mathematics or science or philosophy, or writing novels and poems, or making music, or painting pictures, or studying history, or healing the sick, or bringing up our children to be generous and kind, we leave the universe a little more conscious than we found it. And that’s the point.\nMARY MIDGLEY PHILOSOPHER\nRichard Dawkins has told us that the cosmos is pointless. Our universe has, he explains, “precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil, no good”, nothing but “pitiless indifference”. This suggests that human life—which is, after all, part of the universe—must be pointless too. Dawkins, however, plainly doesn’t think so, or he wouldn’t find it worthwhile to work so vigorously at spreading his philosophical views. And in our biosphere this perseverance is not exceptional. A vast variety of organisms, from snails to eagles, work fiercely and persistently at their own business. Acorns buried under paving-stones don’t just settle down there in comfort. They do their damnedest to wriggle out and grow up into proper oak trees. Human beings, too, often work incredibly hard, tilling the soil, catching fish, exploring deserts or busily writing books to cure other people’s errors.\nSometimes, however, the road before them runs out into the sand and they must look around for alternative possibilities. What they want then is a wider context, a larger hope to which their work can contribute. Thus, when Tennyson’s Northern Farmer looks back over his life on his deathbed, he is happy because he can claim that he “stubb’d Thornaby Waäste”—that is, he has cleared it, making it fit for crops and cows—fit for the decent agriculture that he believes in. His son, however, very differently, forbids his own son (quite in today’s style) to marry a girl with no money:\n“Wot’s a beauty? The flower as blaws –\nBut proputty, proputty sticks, an’ proputty, proputty graws …”\nWe might not now want to endorse either of these world views. But we surely follow the same method of looking outward towards a larger perspective, even if that means looking as far as the limits of the universe. What we aim at is surely the welfare, success and prosperity of whatever cause, or whatever people, we most love, honour and wish to be part of. That aim is what gives point and meaning to our lives—which is why we need to choose it so carefully.\nJOHN BURNSIDE POET\nAs any teenager can tell you, it’s a short step from asking the question: “What does it all mean?” to arriving at the inevitable answer: “Nothing.” Meaning is constructed by each person after her own fashion, his own nature; there is no universal formula or divine plan—no “all”—that can make individual lives meaningful. At first, such a realisation can lead to dismay: befuddled by the schemes and promises of our elders and betters we had trotted dutifully to school and kirk and community discos full of the blithe enthusiasm youth is cursed with, in the sure expectation that a worthwhile life would just fall into place, with a modicum of effort, so long as we did the right things. Maturity, love and marriage, job satisfaction, happiness—they were all out there, waiting to be achieved. So we thought, until this perennial teenager’s question cropped up, and we began to doubt.\nDoubt is a good thing, most of the time. As is the shedding of illusions, however painful the process. For after dismay, after the insomniac nights and the hollow feeling in the pit of the mind, what follows (if our supposed betters can be persuaded to refrain from meddling) is the gradual understanding that, since meaning is neither fixed nor universal, it is determined, to a significant extent, by the power of the individual imagination. True, there is a world out there that would compel us to conform, to consume, to render unto Caesar. But we are, nevertheless, free to resist, free to imagine, free to furnish our lives, and the terrain we inhabit, with meanings that derive from our own natures, and from the nature of our home terrain.\nHenry Miller remarked that “life has to be given a meaning because of the obvious fact that it has no meaning.” But he also said that “the aim of life is to live, and to live means to be aware, joyously, drunkenly, serenely, divinely aware.” In a conformist society, the attainment of that joyous, drunken, serene awareness is both an act of resistance and a personal achievement, for it says to hell with Caesar and his tawdry coin, and leaves each of us to invest life with all the intangible and unaccountable forms of wealth that the imperial minions in their counting house can scarcely begin to imagine.\nELIZABETH KOLBERT REPORTER\nThe “point”, Darwin taught us, is to pass on our genes. This is as true for humans as for any other organism—chimpanzees, for example, or planaria. The formula worked for life for the 3.5 billion years before Homo sapiens came along, and it isn’t likely to change now, just because people tend to find it unsatisfying.\nMost of us would, of course, prefer to believe our lives have a higher purpose than those of E. coli. The very capacity to aspire—to truth and beauty, fame and fortune, intimacy and immortality—is one of the characteristics that sets modern humans apart from other species. But the mistake is to project the structures of our minds onto the nature of existence, to demand that the world conform to the way we think about it. “Endless forms most beautiful” evolved without us, and will continue to do so after we’re gone.\nPerhaps the wisest thing we could try to do is to make peace with pointlessness. This is not so much a prescription for personal happiness as a petition on behalf of creation. Right now, expressions of human purposefulness are transforming the planet—reshuffling the biosphere, altering the atmosphere, and changing the chemistry of the oceans. We’ve ushered in a new geological age, the Anthropocene, which is likely to be marked by the highest extinction rates since the asteroid impact that did in the dinosaurs.\nHow might we pursue a less purposeful existence? We could begin by trying to do less. This might seem like a negative goal, but it would actually be hugely consequential. As it stands right now, humanity’s most lasting accomplishment will be our pruning (or hatcheting) of the tree of life: a sad legacy, and one we should do everything in our power to avoid. The challenge to us as a species is to let other species pass on their genes—to allow them, too, to have a point.\nYIYUN LI NOVELIST\nA while ago, I worked as a researcher in a hospital laboratory, studying asthma with mice as the animal model. My job was to inject ragweed into the mice over a period of time and measure the effectiveness of a new drug. There was a glass chamber, I remember, where I put the mice to induce asthma, and then analysed their breathing patterns. That and other methods gave me the data of their illness, though imperceptible to me was their physical sensation: suffering, which is an individual feeling, cannot be measured.\nAsthma comes from a Greek word, meaning panting. But in ancient Rome, the doctors nicknamed it “rehearsing death”. I ran into this detail while reading Seneca’s letters to his disciple Lucilius. Seneca, like Dickens, Proust, Dylan Thomas, E.B. White, Elizabeth Bishop—the list could go on—was afflicted with asthma, an ancient disease that hasn’t, unlike many others, gone away. There was no one trying to cure the illness by dissecting mice in Seneca’s time.\nEveryone, sooner or later, draws their last breath. What’s the point of living, one could ask, if we all have to come to a dead end? What’s the point, if life never tires of offering situations like asthma? Far from fatal, these nevertheless cause inconvenience, suffering, even despair—in a letter Stefan Zweig wrote before his and Lotte Zweig’s suicides, he mentioned her incurable asthma as one of the reasons for their decision.

Finally an honest review of Fenty beauty.
OMG your makeup is so nice you look amazing year girl xxx
Love how you say rock on, just how Monique does <3
anyone else have to turn down vol for michaels intro music hahahah
I love how Aussie you speak! ♥️🐨
Am i the only one who actually liked the eye makeup look as a whole? I thought it made his eyes pop 😍😄
Too much foundation, that’s why the contour stick ain’t blending
Complaining about the contour stick when you're sponge is still covered in the foundation. Of course it's gonna look like that
You over exaggerated just a little with the unicorn highlight stick 😂 it is honestly not that bad when applying it on customers it's best used when warming the actual product on the back of your hand and patting onto the skin instead of just wiping it onto the skin which will lift whatever is underneath it
Legit, if your ever having a bad day you, just need a little Michael fix!! You make me laugh dal 😘
Great come back Ginger Jim! No I'm married with 2 babies thanks hun for the kind words!!! Your an idiot problem some lonely loser trolling people and cutting them down!!! And after this I'm not adding fuel to the fire it's clearly you can tell you have NO RESPECT FOR THE WAY PEOPLE ARE!!!!!

What watch is that sean
Become a sushi chef in two months......... Lol
The mustang released in 1964 1/2. Damn Sean. Letting down the Midwest.
Hey Shawn hold the spine of the knife just above the handle with your thumb and for finger and wrap the rest around the handle  you will get better control of the knife
Mustangs fist got introduced in 1964 1/2 but I definitely knew what you meant 😆
Need hot sauce to eat it or what?
So we filleted our straight bass\nSean...it's striped bass.
So 1:30 in and already they are lying to me. That is not a a stripped bass. The lines are broken.
I want to eat sushi off of Sean, Fantano, and Binging with Babish's shiny bald heads.
0o0 when he chops the fishys head
When they're cutting near the beginning you can see how inexperienced he is just by his knife technique when cutting to the middle bone because he holds the knife with his finger on the blade.  Surprised the teacher didn't  point it out
I would be dope for them to have a video on traditional shojin ryori sushi.
Plot twist the Asian guy on the thumbnail is Sean.
I hope he meant p-51 mustangs, not Ford mustangs........
Ik he's not a car guy but a 1950's mustang is not a thing 😂 mustangs became a car in 1964.5
That intro is what I like to call sushi porn
The justin Timberlake of food 
Sooo... There's an anime with this premise right?
It's still just a finesse game the chef is just moving forward...lmao I love Sean
Dude's such a sushi master that he has sponsor logos on his chef jacket
I feel like Sean Evans is so robotic and has no personality. He's like the Jason Bateman of interviewers
Gotta love those 1950's mustangs that came out in 1964 and 1/2.
as someone getting into blades and sharpening.  I have nothing but the utmost respect for a sushi chefs and how well they can sharpen their knives
Someone call Flava Flav Sean has the guy's clock on his wrist.
now kill a chicken next and make wings from scratch :)
that blonde girl... damn stole the show
There is not a 1950's Mustang. LOL
Sean's roll looked pretty dodge but I bet it still tasted nice as fuck!
Shawn Evans acts like a female.....jeeezzz
1:04 that's only four things.  Not five things.
Lol love it, 1950's mustang hahaha you killed it bro

Chef was a champ, seems like a cool dude
Next Hot ones we need Hot Ones: with ROADMAN SHAQ PLEASE LIKE THIS SO THEY CAN SEE IT
In school I used to always question why the things we were learning were relevant to our us. Now I willfully click on these kinds of videos...
The secret to good sushi is bad fish. C'mon, guys.
A little finger action?
Anyone realize this guy appeared in GMM Crew ep with mike and Alex and they made sushi like the spider one
Does Sean do any stand up comedy? I'd love to see some of that
Man, Sushi *looks* SO good..... Alas, tis not. lol
You better not replace Sean ever, or you'll lose all your subs
Shawn is my favorite internet personality rn, so genuine and funny. Thank you for the content !!!
There are five things we teach\n\n*names 4 things
Honestly if Sean made my sushi I wouldn't know if he was a pro or a rookie lolol
here's what I don't understand, why scale the fish if you're going to fillet it? what was the point of scaling if you're cutting the skin off the flesh anyway?
3:26 Never heard of a straight bass Sean
aaaaaaah i need some sushi now
Sushi quality looks fetching terrible
Great interview!
1960s* mustang, sean.
Hahahaha awesome.. tnx Sean this was entertaining :)
this was awesome!
1950s Mustang?
Daddy Evans
great series, love how he was honest with the ratings lol
how does someone who knows nothing to little about preparing food get a food show???\n*white privilege
nope, no raw fish for me, i dont want vibrio cholerae in me
Did these motherfuckers just sushi-fy a fucking striper???
1950 mustang?
1950s mustang
Sean that watch though!!!
I'm a fan, but - I just don't think the world needed another white people learn to make sushi in ten minutes short, you know? I feel like it's been done and done and *done* at this point.
8:31 That's much better than at the truck stop.  Sean, open up a sushi truck stop.
No such thing as a 1950s mustang. They came out in 1964
lose the playa watch please!
Hey guys. Commenting here so I can plug Jiro Dreams of Sushi, one of the greatest sushi documentaries out there, and quite possibly one of the greatest documentaries of all time. You guys should definitely take the time to watch it. That's all.
more of a snowflake situation. killed me
I like how you are switching it up. Good job man.
sean is not even fun to watch. boring hipster dressing motherfucker
The chef reminds me of Adam Sandler for some reason
I really enjoyed the video, but you don't need to stay in character all the time. This segment seemed a little forced.
Little finger action?  That didn't sound right haha
I love Sean, but his knife technique is horrendous.
Mustangs didn’t exist until the end of 1964 nerd. No such thing as a “round 1950’s mustang”.
He has so much pride about making sushi it’s very wholesome
Love sushi! Thanks Sean your videos are always making me hungry and teaching me simultaneously.
Best channel!
damn that big ass watch !
Honestly super proud of Sean. Great work! 
Where did you see a 1950s mustang?
lol 1950's Mustang
nice gold watch
@0:35 THAT ACTION POSE!
Remove your watch before cooking.
You fucked up the tuna! :'(
little finger action... \n \nsean, you tease...
64 sean. mustangs... 64 man..
jheez that looks good
Hair net? What hair net?
#ricegumisabitch
Little finger action? Uh huh.
rounded out like a 1950s mustang? i think sean needs to stick to eating chiken wings
isn't that the sushi chef from gmm? xd

EVERYTHING about this is just amazing! The fact that you showed where your inspiration came from, and also credited Madeyewlook for the technique is sosososo great, a lot of other people wouldn't do that!
I want to do this look with blonde hair and think I want to go for another color than this blue/green. What do you think could be a good color?
Your paint colors are giving me Beetlejuice vibes! Such a creative look🔥🔥
THIS LOOK IS EVERYTHING! OMG the talent is surreal!!
Awesome!! Where are the contacts from?!
YASSS Desi! Can you do your take on like a Dumbo/Elephant (cute or scary) inspired Halloween look? I haven't seen one like that, and I feel like it would be a challenge that you would kill!
My god you are the hottest demon ever!
You’re so talented! And u always do such unique Halloween makeup tutorials! 👏🏼🎃🖤

dominic is getting sooooo big😭😻
I love the fact the pool is gated, u guys really put wicky first
Okay. I cant get over the fact how loyal you two both are to each other. Y'all both have been together fpr 2-3 years, moved into a bomb ass house, got engaged,had a son, then move into another bomb ass house. Yall have the funniest little arguments but whem its ovet tell each other 'i love', you both make the craziest pranks on each other and you either get pissed or cry but in the end tell each other 'I love you' . yall can act totally ridiculous in public or not but never be embarrassed of each other. Yall both will do anything for each other amd it sets so much goals for people and its so inspiring.❤\nYall just keep doing what yall are doing cause you both dont know how much you impact on yalls fans and set huge examples for love. You both are the best parents dominic will ever ask for and you both are going to raise him so well!💕 #wilsonfamily

Marvel Fanboys: Hating Everything with even the littlest thing similar to what Marvel has done\n\nDC Fanboys: Loving and Defending DC
Superman makes me think of Gaston,idk why lol
Black panther looks better than this lol i love jason tho
Ben was right.DC world needs Superman.
looks promising! just 1 question,who da fagg did ben affleck sleep with to get the role of the batman? he is more like the tick material.
They made Aquaman cool again, MY MAN!!!!!!
Go to 0:02 put the speed on 0:25 and enjoy :)
DC movies always have the best trailers but end up being a huge waste of time and money
I CANT WAIT NO MORE =(  THIS MOVIE WILL BE AWESOME.
it's your bat signal,,,it's very funny LOL
@0:59 The moment I finally accepted the DCEU.
I miss when super hero movies looked real
Another dull,boring pile of shit with awful CGI,from DC.
definitely some Joss Whedon-ish lines in this trailer.
I hope the Wonder Twins are in this
I love Jason mamoa so much but why did they make his character seems so dorky ?
rip superman now he lives with Harambe
These are my kind of people!
Please do not underestimate how epic and powerful this soundtrack is! Gang of Youths cover of David Bowies Heroes! Just so epic!
Please don't suck like all the others
“I made him a promise. That’s why I brought you together.”
I think it's too CGI-heavy, especially the surrounding.
If they put sub zero an dlc character that will be cool
I am not watching this movie because of Ben Affleck. He's a sexist and misogynistic. He grabbed a boob 14 years ago.
It's always boring when you have a 'swarm' as the main enemy. It just becomes dull harmless fodder for the characters to practice on.
The cgi doesn’t look good
Why does Aquaman look like a Klingon?
FROM MR SUPERMAN 3BC1 A TEXAS N AMERICA THE USA N A WORLD WITHOUT HATE MONSTERS OF ALL KINDS N ALL TYPES U FREAKING MALE HATE MONSTERS OF TOTALLY DISRESPECT N TOTALLY DISRESPECT OF ALL BABIES N KIDS N CHILDREN N TEENAGERS N WOMEN THEY ARE NOT TRASH LET ME ALL U MALE HATE MONSTERS OF ALL KINDS N ALL TYPES N ALL OTHER HATERS OF ALL TYPES N ALL KINDS LET ME TELL ALL U MALE HATE MONSTERS N ALL OTHER KINDS N ALL TYPES N ALL RELIGIOUS NUT MONSTERS N WAR MONGERS CREATORS N SCHEMERS N PLANNERS N CREATORS OF COVERT WARS N BLOOD MONEY FOR PROFITS
It looks bad, I think that marvel put the standards of a superhero movie so high, that even an average movie will not satisfy the majority.
Lmao this trailer looks lowkey bad but I love Women Woman, the Flash seems adorable, plus Aquaman and that Cyber guy, whoever he is, look pretty cool. Basically, the plot, Superman, and Batman seem boring. But all the other characters look awesome. Especially Wonder Woman. God I love her.
you can tell Whedon injected some of his style into this and made it less suck
Welllll I've been let down by every other DC movie until Wonder Woman...maybe she started a trend and this will be amazing? Good luck WB. Hopefully your studio meddling hasn't ruined the glorious potential of yet another film.
I knew that was Cyborg in the video clip in Batman vs Superman! Still think Thor Ragnarok will be better...but this looks pretty good!
How many more superhero movies will be shoved up our ass?? Boycott hollyweird!!
I can’t wait for all of these movies to come out
Is Joss (or Zack) at least making Aquaman a credible hero again instead of just a punchline?
i really want this to be a good movie! trailers got me excited, but theres a lot of movies where the trailers incredible and the movies garbage. for now i'm off to watch some justice league unlimited!
Whats the song name?
Did i just watch the whole movie and batman is fighting alien with superpower with his brain?
The CGI looks amazing, the way you can see Steppenwold trying to terraform the earth
I'm just here for the song. Anyone please?
All In just reminds me that that isn't the real Barry Alan.\nThey are starting to convince me t his could be good. The if you seek his monument, look around you was a very nice touch.
pre-order for a free playable superman dlc
Seeing the robot guy thrown seamen in the sky to kill one space bug is one of the dumbest things I've see all year in movies...
The expression on Bruce's face when Barry is talking about the batsignal is the face of a man who has already lived through two generations of Robins hyping tf out over everything bat-related.
I think they should call the avengers...
*sees Ben Affleck* \nOh but there's no WAY IN HELL I'll watch this shit\n*sees Gal Gadot*\n😍... goddamn it, okay, I guess I'll 😒
God! That music along with the scenes mades so hyped!
was that a flirt between Wonder Woman and the Bat?
The first minute and a half is a nice pace for the somber elements, but when the bat signal is charging up ( @1:27 ) my hope is they speed things up at least a third. Cool effort from the WB team.
Batman: I don't use guns...\n1:44
It's not a movie it is just animation.
https://youtu.be/JHIuZPL27iw\nWatch it.
oy vey, terrible trailer, shut it down!
We missed SUPER MAN
love it. <3 yes.
Ride aint over yet.... My man 😂
Evil Superman vs Justice League🙏🏼
Import top put person swing whisper evolution secure distribution.
Ezra Miller is adorable im shook

I'm scared.
can't wait !!
Justice league vs the avenger xD
When did superman die? 😅
the music please?
Superman Superman Superman Superman Superman Superman
MÉXICO ,..Dónde están los likes Mexicanos ,..DC está aquí
Gal Gadot looks great.
Cyborg? More like CGI man...
Tickets go on sale on All Hallows’ eve.
Mah man *cringe*
Im so hyped
Meh.
World needs Superman!
Please be good
The CGI is shit in some scenes....need some serious polish.  Most of it I think looks good, but I hate it when studios think shitty CGI is okay to pass off.  Some CGI scenes are good, that's what boggles me.  Some are great, and some really just...no.
This is already better than anything  marvel has done.
Fuck that new flash guy😡
the cgi looks.... not the high quality as i expected to be :/ #nohate
Only let down is ben affleck. he is less batman and more fatman. chubby faced mother fucker. plus he sounds like a 15 yr old trying to put on a deep voice when he talks as fatman. Who ever cast him needs to be shot and once dead. repeatedly beaten with a huge rubber dildo just to show the level of disrespect they are due
#Coming soon. The best superheros movie 2017
This looks dumb and stupid, sorry.
Who the fuck thought bringing this random guy to play the flash is a good idea ?!
DC should also make live action metamorpho movie too if they think it is right.
As bad as Man of Steel was, there's no denying the soundtrack was amazing.
sucks.
They seem really hopeless
why is this kid playing flash and not actual Flash  as in Grant Gustin who plays Flash in the series?
Trash CGI compared to Marvel. The only good thing about this is the music. I like the idea, I love DC, but this looks way too fake and childish. The only CGI I can accept is Cyborg.
Another CGI fest...
2:13....my man!!!! I'm so moist now!!!!
Can't wait for it to be out. Not sure if it could compete with the Marvel Franchise.
Please can Marvel and DC just die already so we can get some genuinely good films and not this shitty superhero crap every year
Bruno is so awesome\n No wonder why he is the pop king of this generation. I admire him so much. HOOLIGANS CAN Y'ALL RELATE?!
King of Talents. Give him all the existent awards already!!
Oh man that voice and those back ups 👍👍👍
For all these autotuned ass singers please be able to sing live cause if not we know u can't sing. Bruno sounds good wit auto tune, without auto tune, he sounds great live and even better accapela so if u don't like of love Bruno mars the u on some strong ass week or coke💯💯
I guess this song means he learned his lesson in *When I Was Your Man* and now treating his girl right.
I dearly  love this artists if  I were 30years younger  I d make it my best to met him there  is  not one song he has written  that I don't  love at age 67 he has brought nothing but joy to my life I'd love to have money to go to one of his shows it would be the best thing to happen to me except  the birth of my children
How u gonna tell me BM isn't one of the greatest to ever do it??
I love this new version! Bruno Mars and The Hooligans are the best!👍🏽👏🏽😘
The next backpack kid
This guy is pure talent
why is he sitting in backpack?
I love this song. It's very good
Still sounds just as good

Why does Bruno has a backpack he looks like Dora the explorer
Wait until you see the SEX Tape Bruno made with Steve Harvey.. Repugnant ! You'll never guess which one was the pitcher & which one was dressed like Little Bo Peep.. swashbuckling Madness
Most underrated artist/performer. I don't always like his songs but he is very talented and a great entertainer.

I missed the first 2 mins of the video and had to go back because I'm just staring at that perfect liner 😅 how do you do it Suzie! I got the nude bow jumper too and the cape coat I love it haha! <3
We have the same aviator jacket 😬 I love it! It's so warm. Looks great on you x
Love the aviator jacket! Your fashion content is so nice to watch :) xx
Zara is life! Love these pieces!
I have the red jumper with the bow except In cream, but it's gone so bobbly already even though I haven't washed it. Does anyone know how I can save it? So sad it looks so old and worn :(
You're looking good, girl!🙌🏻 Cute Haul!!!
Don’t keep the pink jumper with the black bow doesn’t really look cute and it kinda makes you look wide and hides your figure ✨
The shearling jacket is SO CUTE!
Loved every single item you bought!! Super cute and cozy!!
Me encantaron todas las prendas  <3
She looks like she's coping off Zoella
Olivy, bat wingy, nudy, cardy, camelly, syntheticy, plasticy.....?????
https://youtu.be/DZVJC6guVaY
love the herringbone scarf!!
Love your suede jacket 🌷
Aviator jacket camel jumper and green cardigan are gorgeous. You have lovely style suzie x
Great haul!💖👌
getting that beanie for sure!!
where your earrings from?
Happy birthday
pls do more zara haul!!! ♥️
Love your try on hauls 💚 saludos desde Argentina! 💚😘
How tall are you?
what do you wear on your lips? The color is so beautiful!!
I love your jewellery in this video. So stylish and simple.
I love this background for your videos. Just so pleasing to look at.
Please can you do an autumn dresses haul?
Where is your choker from? Xx
Ooh lovely haul. You must have been totally in the zone. The red jumper, colour is amazing on you and the grey pearl hat is fabulous. Grey  jumper makes the gold earrings pop and the aviator jacket makes me want to go and try one on. Am not a fan of batwing stuff for myself as they are pain to wear under coats though.
The jeans you’re wearing are fab! Where did you get them?
I like your videos...but I suggest something...you explain everything really well...no need to re-explain when you try them on...you takes ages on every item...loved everything you picked up...👍
I love scarves!!! I'm obsessed with them! 🙈
You're so beaut! Thanks for sharing your haul!
Hi Suzie, Love your video. Thank you. Please can you share where your jeans are from? They are lovely!! Xx
Those jeans ! Where is it from ??? 😍 your body👌
Her youtube channel is called helloOctoberxo...?
loved this haul! recently did a little shopping at Zara as well! :)
My faves were the grey and camel scarf, and the camel jumper! Oh and the cream cardigan😍🙋💛Been looking for one like that for a while! 💖💖
loved so many items! Why have I decided to go capsule wardrobe 😩
How tall are you?
Where are your earrings from, love them!
How did you make your thumbnail where you cut yourself out with the white bit around you? Xx
Hello October, you've come round so quickly! 🍁
Really like this makeup look, I know you said the lipstick is discontinued but I'd love a tutorial of the whole look
Looove those scarves!! I picked a couple up last year and after using the soft ones I couldn't go back to any of my other ones... also, can you link us your jewelry pieces?!
I love the font you use on your thumbnails! What is it called?
Who knows where to find the short necklace that she is wearing? Please?)
good call on the aviator jacket - you're right .. its the perfect length on you! lovely haul - love you!!
where are your earrings from? i love them!!
Oh my I LOVED every single thing in this haul 😍💜
Paused the video to buy the red sweater with the bow. 😂
Number 14 on trending eeeek!!!! Loved this haul, but my bank account did not 😂 love the olive tones and that scarf is lovely 😍
Hey Suzi , just wondering what hairdresser you go to ..? :) loved the haul. Knew you would kill it with an autumn haul. The aviator jacket is sooo flattering on you 😍😍
could you tell me what jeans you are wearing???
Very good video!but i cannot opeen the links!i want to buy firectly things i have got iphone6 and when i cleek on them it goes to a blank page whatever video i  see!can u help?thnk u!
girl im buying every single jumper, cardigans, scarves, and that suede jacket yesssss I love all of them so cosy and pretty and pretty much my style for every autumn and winter season cause dang its cold up here in the north of america 😅☁️🌧🌨🌦☔️
everything is beautiful.. also  the last coat..
That olive cardigan is absolute GOALS! It looks so soft and cozy, which is a must have for the fall! 😍🍂
Where are the white drawers behind you from please?
How tall are you? It would just be helpful in relation to sizing :)
I have the same faux suede jacket and I am soo happy with it! It's so worth buying. Love your hauls, especially Zara ones!!!!😍
Use a bobbypin to fix the snag in your jumper!
Your hair colour is just so nice :D
Everything looks amazing and suits so well! Except I agree that the “cape style” coat at the end doesn’t sit as well as the other pieces.
What lipstick are you wearing? It look amazing on you!! xoxo
When u wear the cuffs over your hands!!! 🙈
I got the same jacket but in pink xD
tha aviator jacket looks so perfect on you !!!! i love ur videos !
Love your style..more of hauls.. I just added everything in wishlist 😍😍💗
Fell in love with your earrings, where are they from? <3
That leather jacket you're wearing when showing the beanie!! Where is it from I've been after a jacket like that!!
I'm sooo gold you said that about jumpers being tight at the bottom and that they're not as flattering. All the jumpers I have that I love are loose and I was just about to get a tight one on ASOS. Ta!  Haha
So jealous that you can wear scarves and sweaters already, we’re still waiting for the cold in New York 😭
These videos are my favourite! Try on hauls are the best.
I bought the cape coat but returned it because it was just too thin. For the money I didn’t think it was worth it. Also didn’t have any washing instructions in it 🙈
I just ordered the oversize cardigan in gray. It will be perfect for when I fly to New Zealand in February. I had to limit my self, but wanted to buy everything in this haul💕
Ohhh so nice! Girl three bags for your birthday- you don't need to justify yourself! Love love love xxx
The grey hat. Love it.
Love the cardigans and herringbone grey /beige scarf, I love the bat wing coat on you, will be best when it's really cold as it looks roomy and big enough to wear a thick jumper underneath and still button it up. Your style is so good Susie X ❤️👍🏻💕
Makeup tut on this look please
Love the green cardigan and the suede jacket best.  I love the pink jumper contrasted with the black tie (very Chanel) but I would return since it has pulls in it.
that first grey scarf looks amazing on you! especially with your hair and makeup like that. so pretty <3
Top haul. I have recently become obsessed with Zara this season. I recently bought an insane pale pink and faux fur sweater with huuuge balloon sleeves. It's life. I LOVE it.
You can poke the pulled thread through the jumper (just stretch it a little bit where it's pulled-you will be able to poke it through one of the holes and pull it through from the inside). I have 2 cats I have to do it all the time!
Great video! You got so many cute clothes!! I have a small channel that I am really trying to grow. I would be super grateful if anyone could go check it out!💜
LOVE LOVE LOVE everything from this haul. I'm a short arse too and I need that aviator jacket it's perfect. 👌 Where are you jeans from you're wearing in the cut away frames? Xx
I bought the same sweaters in the exactly same colors😂
What jeans are you wearing?
Where are your jeans from? x
Do you actually try things on in store?
I want that camel jumper on you so much but it’s out of stock :’(
Where are your earrings from?
actually, I think the cape is really cute. It's really stylish and fashionable.
Where is this lipstick from? :)
To be honest I'll never get why anyone would consider something 'high quality' when it's literally made up of only plasticy synthetic fibers like acrylic that will look terrible after a year of wearing...
I just want subs
Youtube made me buy it...so I now got the beige scarf, thanks Suzie ;-). I'd totally be in favour of a Bag Collection video :-)
Love this zara haul would love to see more of these
Does anyone know where her gold choker is from? Been looking for it forever xx
Love these type of videos with try ons!Also love the scarves.Liked them all from the start on your youtube vlogs!
To clarify: I never said I was definitely returning it (or the company took it back), I said we'll see if they let me! as a joke, knowing I've done a lot of stuff in it and also made a video documenting me doing those things, implying that they would definitely not let me return it. Sorry if that didn't come across or if anyone got confused! xox
I would've worn the t-shirt with the tutu sash.
10/10 would buy it just to smack people with it as I walk past them.
Sounds like/rhymes with net-ah-por-tay.  It's a play on prêt-à-porter, ready-to-wear which is in contrast to couture (tailored to and created for you specifically).\n\nJust fyi.  😉
It looks like you have 4 legs
I would wear the first one for when I have to shake hands with others. I don't do handshakes Or contact with others or eye contact
Later in the week, I went to visit a friend I had to shubscribe!!! Loves it!!
i watched this and u made me feel better thank u for making me lol
THIs whole video is what us short people feel like when we buy anything long sleeved. XD
Ben wasn't fazed by it because he's so used to the weird shit Cristine does lol. Also, I was so worried you would miss the opportunity to tie it down like a straight jacked, but thankfully Cristine delivered!
Oh yeah I bought this jacket and cut the sleeves off
not lying I would wear that I love the sleeves
Hey, Saf, I have been watching your fashion videos and I find them HILARIOUS! As for the jacket, tho, there are many other ways to wear it (especially if you weren't able to return it). Like button the buttons, don't wear the sleeves and tie them around your chest (and maybe a t-shirt or a shirt inside). I think that questionable image of the jacket (fortunately) is not the only way to wear it and this way it can be much better (or so I imagine). Keep cool :)
You made it look so good lol
What happens if you're short and it's raining? >.<
what brand of jeans do you buy?
Dollskill has a ton of stuff with sleeves like this right now :P
This is definitely my favourite video of yours, you're so funny
iN tHiS rOoM *is outside*
are you sure thats a jacket?
Just trim the sleeves if you Dont want it to be long anynore
Some fitting jeans to complete the outfit - https://imgur.com/gallery/nMhXvem
Beyonce wore this kind of jacket on her instagram. It was a long jacket cuffed up
You should try the glossy eye trend!!!
got to love your confidence to wear such weird stuff in public!!!! good on you!
Okej so this happened https://www.instagram.com/p/BaSyJJhnoiu/ the matching shirt
NEXT VIDEO IS I WEAR SUPER LONG NAILS FOR A WEEK and i mean dUPER DUPER LONG OK
You're so pretty :O I don't like denim, but it looks very pretty on you.
The more uncomfortable you seem, the wealthier you are. #hmm
This video made me so extremely uncomfortable that I couldn't watch it but i love all ur other videos
CRISTINE OUT OF HER MAIN HABITAT I DONT KNOW WHAT TO THINK
This was a good video until crisrein showed up
At Disney her skirt flew up
this video made my day. after laughing so much :) love saf so much. she is truly one of a kind.
There are hairy leggings and once I saw them I thought Saf would wear these so here you go
You should wear all the “ugly” stuff for a day  or week
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE SAF GOT HER MINI BACKPACK. I NEED IT 4:07
One spin and everyone is getting slapped
Oh my god, I could not BREATHE for the day seven jacket. This is the hardest I've ever laughed at one of your videos.
you should wear heelys for a week!!
I can see you just swinging it around and let it hit the people that think it’s ugly 😂😂 and girl I can also see you saying “anything that’s on my damn body always look good bitch” 😂😂😂
also saf looks like those car wash advertising blowing figures (completely unsure what these are called oops)
Lol me when I try on those type of jackets
i think the next invention will be mom jeans with clear patches on the butt
am i the only one who noticed she had to blur her butt while twirlling. i love her so much XD
8:41 reminds me of when Mulan was trying to drink Tea in her matchmaker scene xD
Hey guys pleaseee check out my account. Im trying really hard to get some viewsss. ONLY POSIIVE COMMENTS PLEASE. Thanks I love all my fans and really once I'm famous you can say you subscribed first. ANyway love you guys. I love magic school bus so my username and alias is based off of that
5:26 made me laugh like crazy 😂 I loved that
I live for saf's cute weird dances lol
You should make a video of all of your ugliest clothes that you've done and put them all together
i completely lost it when you started dancing with the flailing tube man, oh my lord
_Have you ever worried about your sleeves falling down when you wash your hands?_ *_WELL,THIS IS THE JACKET TO DRIVE YOU INSANE_*
If you weren’t gonna return it... why keep the tag on it?
At 5:28 i laughed soo hard, that I couldn't breathe 😂😂
She’s so beautiful
The gas station part had me dead😂
day 3 with the friend killed me :))))) lmao
You could cut the sleeves and it would be cute
Anyone else think of little nightmares?
I wouldn't call it ugly as much as I'd call it impractical
Wow I like all those things!!
when your tall friend lends you their jacket
Slender man would wear that jacket XD
Ngl I was kinda feeling the outfit with the giant burgundy trousers.
I just have to like binge watch your videos bc they always make me so happy 😂
QUEEEEEEEEEEN! LOVE YOUR VIDS! THESE ONES ARE AMAZING!
GOT7 looked good with overlong sleeves...
5:27 HAHAHA made my day <3
SLENDERMAN JACKET
I would wear it
I kind of like them 😏
Looking Numbuh 3 from Code Name Kids Next Door.
I’d love to have that jacket
Hey Saf! I feel like those shoes will join to the ugliest family pretty nicely ;D http://www.reebok.com/us/instapump-fury-cv/BD4758.html
I like the little history lessons that she gives. Nice touch Saf.
I never thought I needed this jacket until now.
9:58 THEY HAD TO BLUR HER BUTT LMAO
Hahhhahaha that dance😂
It made me think of those inflatable, dancing  cheese-string-looking things at fairs 😂
WEAR ALL THE “ugliest stuff in the world” TOGETHER FOR A DAY
Jenderman
I'm literally a rhythmic gymnast
TRY CRUGGS (crocks+uggs)
10:48 when Saf says simply nailogical but someone types simply illogical :D
“I’m Edward Denim Hands”
10:43 DEAD 💀 😂
omg i laughed so hard!!!!
edward denim hand lol
This is my fav
Ugliest sunglasses?
Haha Safiya at 5:30
Just fold the sleeves.
Saf, you’re beauty with brains.
When you've already shanshed those buttons
still not enuf sleeves
5:46 my replay button died lol \nsafiya attacc mee
Slender man slender man
*casually goes to Disney land*
Mix all your highlights
5:27 my fav moment!! Hahahahaha
I think a BIG detail was missed: Luke's fear!
I love how she pretends to give a fuck about all of this xD
Great job Amy on this episode of Nerdist News!
She talks too fast the first half.  She needs to pace and breathe.  Outside of that, it cracks me up all this crying over Jessica, happens every time she isn't in the video lol
I can't wait for Dec., but seen this new trailer it as the look of a rehash Empire Strikes Back like with The Force Awakens from a New Hope. basically The Empire/New Order & Rebel/Resistance still haven't learn from history. they might have new tech, but still essentially stuck in a loop.
What about the line which Luke says about raw power ?
I bet she has a HUUUGE vagina
We are eternal spiritual beings having a very brief earthly experience.   R.I.P and annihilation are a LIE!! Dont wait until you breathe your last to find this out.  \nhttps://youtu.be/5QqMQNPy2LU\nhttps://youtu.be/p70oyjbKftQ
The grey jedi crap goes against EVERYTHING.
I didn't miss shit!
Pablo Hidalgo tweeted MONTHS ago; \nI don't understand all this Grey Jedi talk. It's the light side, the dark side, and that's it. There is no Grey\n\nI foresee ALOT of disappointed theorists in our future. \n\nI guess this is what happens when fans have NOTHING but time between episodes to make predictions and speculation. \n\nI would say, I'm not hating on the people who speculate! but that wouldn't be true. \n\nI'm letting Lucasfilm fill in the blanks for me. As they have since 1977. They created this thing I hold so dear.
Everyone be like, oh can't watch the trailer! Can't spoil it!\n\n\nMe: @nerdist TEAR THAT $*!T APART.
Star Wars: Return of the Mary Sue
#TEAM CHEWBACCA because he is going to eat that stupid porg thing lol
How many times will Pablo Hidalgo have to tell you Gray Jedi dont exist!? Stop perpetuating the myth!
so an unoriginal movie. Star Wars is ruined.I'm out.
the scene between Brienne of Tarth I mean... Phasma and Finn is reminicent of the Revenge of the sith  cover with Anakin striking Obi-wan with his lightsaber inside Darth Vader's face
#teamporg but where is my girl Jessica!?
Porgs and Star Wars fans are words that will never go in a sentence together. EVER.
How did the star go from being cute to unattractive in just 18 months
Jesus! Fuck! What is it with her eyes?
She reminds me a lot of Pearl from Steven Universe.
But what about Luke being placed on the back of the poster? Like all antagonists have been in the posters as far as I know.
Nothing about Phasma and Fin, but all about the Porgs? Are you taking Star Wars not serious? :)
#teamporg\nI hope I don't wind up regretting that.
The fact that they remembered the blast mark is amazing. So much attention to detail.
Where the hell is Chobot?
that prog is going to be annoying
spoiler warning after playing parts from the trailer. im sure anyone who want avoiding spoilers would not have click this any way. but still you made a shitty warning
Got to love myself a little Porg
I agree with Mark Hamill: They have totally fucked up Luke's character,and this trailer seems to be more evidence of that.  Also, they should retitle this Episode 8: Return of the Mary Sue
Chewie is a legend!! where does he fit in all this? are R2 and 3PO going to continue on their dumbass adventures? what about BB8 and the new evil BB9??? also, Phasma..... how sick does she look?!
Great breakdown because you added bits of info you know as a fan already knolagble about the Last Jedi
Je--Jessica? Is that... you? Wow. Star Wars has changed you
What's with Rey's white lightsaber or am I seeing things?
Loving that Vault-Tec top!!
I suspect Kylo is most likely reaching out to either his mom in the present after her base is destroyed, or to Luke in the past (after destroying his school); not to Rey.\n\nMaybe when Luke says: “this isn’t going to go the way you think” he’s either talking to Kylo in the past before he destroys the school, or to Kylo in the present after he comes looking for Rey after Luke sends her away, or even talking to Leia with the force about Kylo; not to Rey.\n\nI highly-suspect that Snoke is talking about Rey’s power while ‘training’ her with torture or whatever, and with the “something truly special” he’s recalling the evil she felt when considering killing Kylo in the last movie - a move on the path to the dark side. And “fulfill your destiny” is maybe the disappointment Snoke has that she didn’t kill Kylo then, who was just the bait/decoy, so he’s commanding her to do it now. \n\nI then suspect that Rey has a change of heart about Kylo when he starts encouraging her to kill him “kill the past” after their familial relation (and her ‘superior’ bloodline) is revealed...I think Snoke wants to use her unrivaled power as a sith and that’s why he had Kylo kill all the young Jedi and concentrate the force onto her. But, with this imbalance of power, “it isn’t going to go the way Snoke thinks”...maybe she’s so powerful after Leia (and possibly Luke) and other force users ‘die’ that she unwittingly drained the force from all of the remaining ones and hence no more Jedi (or siths)...and then the force finds balance another way, perhaps one we’ve never seen. *excited face*
I'm on team Amy.
NERDGASM FOR THE CRYSTAL FOX!!!!!!!
I miss jessica\n\n
this trailer was the final piece that convinced me: star wars is DEAD.
Could Snoke's torturing of Rey be a force dream and not real?
Some of you guys give nerds a bad name. \nWhat does it matter who is presenting? It's the content I'm here for!
Love the trailer, but I hope it's full to the brim of misdirection like the Rogue One trailers. All I'm going to take from this is that it looks COOL!!!!!
Holy shit the blatant disconcerting reading-face she's doing is the most distracting thing I've seen in weeks, and the fact that you had to KEEP CUTTING TO HER RANDOMLY forced me to keep most of the video off the screen at all times because seeing her leaning forward staring at the cue cards/prompter made every word she said turn into those sounds adults made on Peanuts cartoons.\n\nIf you have to bring someone on that can't read without leaning in and making it obvious, at least don't cut to her at random frequent intervals so it's less of a distraction.
A bit dumb and logic jumpy. I think after that scene with the ships giant robot elephants warp in shooting nuclear bananas.... Could happen!
Fuck Jessica\nShe's a thot
I am hyped for Carrie Fisher but it’s going to break my heart, and I want a nude scene with Poe and Finn... but that’s just me...
Amazing, Amy did great, even she has the same gesture of putting the arms behind her back!! 😍 In general she's more cute and Jess more spicy, but anyway, good job!! 😊
is it just me or thi Amy Vorpahl is just too hot!! damn
Bb8 getting zapped from the back of Poe’s Tie Fighter, a nod to R2D2 getting zapped on the back of Luke’s Tie Fighter in Star Wars A New Hope???
#TeamCrystalFox If they're running into the base it's clear they've been domesticated and are being used somehow by the Resistance. For who knows what but they're cool!
Amy, dunno what you did with you hair but it worked. You looking damn fine.
I wonder is Rey was created by Snoke a'la Darth Plagueis with the purpose of mating with Kylo to give rise to the ultimate Force child?
Balanced Jedi are those who rely on the Light side of the Force. Anakin brought balance (restored the natural balance) by destroying the Avatar of the Dark side, Sidious. The Gray was never canon.
Hey! Nice Vault-Tec dress/shirt(?)!
We are the Porg. Resistance is futile.
Ugh.. Bring back Jessica

Man. I love this channel, but the troop of turds lead by their cocks crying when Jessica isn’t on makes me queasy.
Why do the US and UK trailers have different middles.. THIS CHRISTMAS or THIS DECEMBER around the 1min 20 mark...
Basically its all white males are now bad.... You know, the majority of the USA... Now has to sit back and let 'minorities' take over to become 'equal' WHEN they wont show the same in countries they come from.... Thats how pathetic people are. Wont help each other in their own country BUT make white people PAY for their 3rd world country immigrants that want free stuff and to blame everyone else for their mistakes in life...... How pathetic.
Bring back jessica

I'd love you to do an Atlantis themed cake...!
Whats up with his nose in this video? It looks like serious contouring...
I like your cake
This is so gorgeous! I love it!
I love your crew! This video had my daughter and I cracking up. When will we meet the crew?!?
This has been my favorite video yet- one day I'd love to see the faces behind Spice Girls 2.0 😂👍🏼
JJR ~ I condition the gum paste with shortening as well as rub the outside of the gum paste with shortening before inserting into my extruder.  It works.  Thanks for the laughs!!!  :D
There are definitely five Spice Girls, guys. \n\nSporty, Baby, Ginger, Scary, and Posh.
Sorry jjr, I also love spice girls soooo. I actually like them singing. Bwuahahaha
Can I please marry Brandon?😂 He seems so funny!
the spider looks like a crab
Hi Joshua i liked  your cake design and I’m wondering what type of gold paint do you used??please provide the name Thxs
Amazing how do u do it
Its Saturday and I'm STILL singing Spice Girls songs!\nThanks guys!
I really appreciated watching the struggle of innovation. It made me feel like it is totally worth every time I try something new. Thanks!!
The middle of the video is a hot mess haha
The guys should sing in every episode.
but the spice girls are amazing especially with spice cake
What do you have against Spice girls Joshua ? lol
This thumb up was for the Spice Girls enthusiasts behind the camera. You guys rocked.
I was the grudge for my freshman year of college.... totally won the costume contest! It was badass
I HATE SPIDERS.\nNo wonder this didn't appear in my sub list.
I’m so scared of spiders that it gives me chills even seeing you make it, especially the pointy legs of them but I couldn’t help but watch till the end and it’s beautiful
You love the Spice Girls and you know it! Friendship never eeenndss!
This was extremely good I loved it plz make more videos
To make you feel better there are 5 Spice girls, so Brandon is a little less creepy now. Well on that end of the spectrum 😂
JJR, the spice Girls are nothing to be ashamed of! We all love them, even you! Don't fight the spice.
Where do you get all of your shirts??? I love them!!!
Found your channel from iJustine! Love it.
He hates the Spice Girls,  tries to use a drill to make gum paste strings for decoration, and knows what channel locks are. Yep, definitely a Man . . . About Cake.\n\nAs for my costume, I'll be dressing up as a skeleton for work, but my husband wants us to dress up as peanuts so we can be nuts together.
Does whatever a spider cake does
I love this cake
Next Video please collab with How to Cake It
Aw, JJR, the crew's singing is great though!!! Love the cake (even though I'm arachnaphobic) and the crew!
I was Baby Spice when I was 8, my best friend was sporty spice and my neighbor made us sing for our candy.
Can you do a vampire team please. Beacuse I am a big fan of Twilight movie.🖒👍👍
I loved the guys singing and making JR turn red in the face. LOL 🤣💘
Long time ago I made and wore an autumn-themed costume  (that was inspired by Marjorie the Trash Heap on the puppet show FRAGGLE ROCK)  to work which won 2nd place in the costume contest. It was a separate hood over a long sleeved maxi length dress out of soft, drape coral-orange knit fabric; covered over with preserved florist autumn leaves and stems that I had meticulously appliquéd by hand. The accessory was a fan rake and to remove ANY doubt as to what I was supposed to be, my name tag read:  Pile-a Leaves!\nYou could make an Pile of Leaves autumnal cake like that too.  Bet it would be gloriously golden and gorgeous!
Really bitch! I was about to go to sleep and then I seen this video in my recommendation 💀💀😢😢
The Spice Girl puns! Lol Had me dying!
For the record, there were FIVE Spice Girls. Not four ;)
I love that all the guys started singing spice girls lol 🤣🤣😂
Love the Halloween opening!!!
You put a top panel on you middle tier. Did the gumpaste stay soft enough for the bubble tea straws
You guys are funny! (: JJR I always enjoy watching your vids!
These are two videos I believe everyone should watch and share.\n\n1.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxmEFeKy8aI&t=224s\n\n2.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCLoIorYguU
Is that like a weird instrumental of ghost town in the background???
Honestly I think the spider would have been creepier if he would left it bone white and painted the top-tier gold underneath it. Cuz then I would look like a weird Fusion of the skeleton and spider
One of my most favourite video...if you wanna be my lover LOL 😂
This was one of the funniest episodes ever!!!  I loved watching this one!
Sorry, but I gotta love the singing and the Spice Girls references.  Totally liked for the Spice Girls stuff!!
I like the added Spice Girls 😅
Their singing is beautiful
me and my best friend are thing 1 and thing 2
My best Halloween costume (or, at least, my favorite) was Eric Draven from The Crow. I was about twelve or thirteen, wore an all black outfit with a life-sized crow decoration stitched to the shoulder of my shirt (and of course I had the makeup). It was awesome, and we didn't even get to go trick or treating that year -_-
This is one of the most beautiful cakes I've ever seen! It's so elegant!!! I loved every detail... AMAZING JOB!
so is he a top or bottom
I absolutely love your work!!!! Please please please do a two sided cake!!!!!!
The Halloween intro is amazing
New subscriber here if u wanna be my lover you gotta get with my friends making it last forever frrrrieeeendships never ennnnnnnd😂😂😂😂😁😁😁
Hello I have a question. Is there a reason u don't paint before and touch up after? Just curious.
I wonder where all the cakes go?
The banter between them all made this more enjoyable! Not that it wouldn't be without it but it made me smile 🤗
Loved the singing 😂😂😂,  your cake's look so yummy and beautiful ,  love you're show.
That wasn't a Halloween cake, it was a Wedding cake!!! but the two are not mutually exclusive so I will call this, Halloween Wedding cake 👰🎃🍰,
My best costume was a cardboard refrigerator running
This channel needs more singing 😂😂😂
Best halloween costume was was probably han solo, my friends were chewy, luke and Leia
I want to make a hALloween  but I am terrible at cakes and desserts
I am so in love with this cake!!
You and your crew are my favorite people
Can make a Australia themed cake pls
I will sing a spice girls song every time I hear pumpkin spice lol
https://youtu.be/c1_4SNLT2sk  Não sei se isso te interessa  Você se lembra deste video ?😊

Me encanta estoy muy emocionada por verte en cake&bake Masters saludos desde México #fuerzamexico
Adam is smiling more and more. I love it! :-)
 if you don't like your family you can always drink al little bit more  ...............WHAT 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Andrew x steven yesssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!
Why do these guys get gayer and gayer over time?!?!?
Made me want to go get brunch
when they're that big, they're called Prawns, not shrimp. That is the standard size prawn in Australia. We don't have shrimp.
Steven and Andrew's relationship has really evolved over the seasons.
Stuffing yourself on pancakes and getting sloppy drunk on mimosas just became something I now need to do.
I think for next time u guys are doing brunch u should come to miami we have the best brunch restaurants
Go to  Salinas ,  Ecuador  and try the different Ceviches - at different prices.
off to Beverly Hills!!!....oh wait its Monday
Imma eat more than you today i had to watch that twice to figure out what he actually meant
You know they're drunk when all three have to cram in the back while someone else drives. My kind of brunch!
My God. I HAVE to go to the Belvedere.  That place would have to be my winner because where else can you get all you can eat premium foods?? And champagne??
Every meal that costs more than 50$ can't be worth it by definition of money and humanity.
How much money do you spend yearly on these videos
My heart melted when they got Adam that pancake ❤ I'm so glad they include him in the fun
2:24 now i can imagine every time andrew sees a baby, he squishes the thigh for no reason. XD
BRUNCH = BOOZE/Mimosa/Bloddy Mary. Period. End of story. Brunch without booze is sad breakfast.
Hi👋HIGHLIGHT (Beast) has release album #CELEBRATE to celebrating their 8yrs debut anniversary.with song title #canbebetter MV👇\n https://youtu.be/ZJy8tsVEo9I and https://youtu.be/WZkGjxy-fz0 please give it so much love and interest ❤🙇

Trying to get 1 Million Subs without a single video, help me make the dream happen! I appreciate everyone's help. P.S. This is for a market research project. Thank you to anyone who subs, have a great day.
I want adam to talk or at least smile please
Steven: I love this taco as much as I love you.\nAndrew: I wish i can say the same\n\n\n😂😂😂😂
Adam just ate pancakes like a pizza ....omg PIZZA PANCAKE coming to a heaven near you 👍🏼
...\nReally guys, I'm shipping you so hard xD \nLOL I love your Worth It videos
Adam is finally getting his meal, the rest of the other foods were diets.
Who else can see the Asian glow?
6:42 Make this into a Buzzfeed Debatable video. STAT.
What is it about brunch that makes people so affectionate towards each other?????
I'm the Adam in my Friend trio
Steven is wearing his suit from the Worth It: Suit edition! Lulz it looks good 🤗
I just love Andrew so much
Like a baby’s thigh 😂
am i the only one who wants to slap adams neck so badly? i mean he never talks he just eats
I just wanna give the sound guy a hug
is it just me or are they just the most photogenic people ever?
You cut pancake pieces from the entire stack as one. Not eat one pancake bite at a time. Who raised you!?
Adam was way too cute
in my country you can get way bigger pancake pile with many delicious toppings for just 6 euros .... 15 is just too much
I was watching this next to my brother and he asked if that was rice gum hahahaha 😂😂
When is BuzzFeed going to announce the nuptials for Stephen and Andrew?
How do these guys eat all of this food I barley have room in my tummy
STEVEN KEPT THE SUIT FROM THE SUITS EPISODE? WHAT! It was way too expensive for brunch brah.
Is this filmed in L.A.?
are Breakfast tacos just liike a texas thing? cuz they are like a must have here, and when i went to louisiana i asked someone if they have breakfast tacos and they looked at me as if i was speaking korean to them....
They look fancyyyy at the buffet!
Im super hungry right now i didnt eat Breakfast But today I will eat My brunch
Thumbs up for finally really going for it when feeding Adam!
Do an episode where the camera man takes control instead of you two
The worst part about watching this is that.. It's 11:27 in the morning and I still did not have *Brunch* yet.. And my stomach is growling.
I've watched a lot of these and the white guy is CLEARLY so uncomfortable with Steven being affectionate.
You guys should do a worth it episode on queso dip
These are pretty weak brunch's, except for the last one that's a true brunch.
I'm here to educate you. No I ain't talking books.
why does adam just sit at the back doing nothing but eat xDDD
Whats the purpose of this show when they call every meal delicios???
Do an episode on hibachi
Omggg I just realised that brunch is lunch and breakfast mixed together (like the word) 😂
Is “Breezy” even real? I feel like they hired Anna Paquin to dye her hair brown and play a restaurant owner with crazy eyes.
they are definitely gay
Adams smile tho 😍😂😂😂
Adam's smile killed me omg Adam ily
Adams face at 8:59 - 9:01 😂
ADAM IS EXTREMELY SHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Stacks on stacks on stacks on stacks! I died
5:08 Andrew sounds like Shane
Scrambled eggs Inna frying pan?!
Are eggs vegetarian?
It hurts to watch this
This should be a real tv show!!
Do buffet, so adam can get his overflowing meal
$20 worth of drinking or $200!?
Shane wouldent be happy if he found out that Ryland was eating this fancy
Its a shame that these guys are working for a company that only cares about money, although I dislike buzzfeed, i find these guys entertaining to watch to.
1: sub to me\n2: like this comment \n3. Comment done\n4 I will sub back to you\nThank you xoxoxo
THAT'S THE SONG FROM THE SIMS 100% YOU CAN'T FOOL ME ADAM AND OTHER WORTH IT EDITORS, YOU SNEAKY-BEAKIES.
When Steve say I think bruch is like the ultimate way to like, win somebody's heart He just look Andrew.\n\nI don't care, I'll ship them.

HAS HE NOT REALIZED SRIRACHA IS AN OFFICIAL WORD IN THE DICTIONARY
Dave as an og parodian from 200k I have to say the quality of your content has gone down. You mainly just eat food and do arcade games. I mean I guess some people are interested in that stuff but the stuff you did before with alboe was a lot better. I have also noticed that your sub growth has slowed considerably. Before in 6 months you gained about 1 mil subs. Now after 6 months you barely grew 700k.
The cookie and cream pocky BBBBIITTTTCCCCHHHH who dick I gotta suck for someone to send it to me ???
I say\n\n\n\n\n\n TAKE IT EASY!
dave: let's keep it pg! NAUGHTY~ \n\n.... well ok then

those are!!! my favourite flowers!!!! and im a Mentally Ill (tm)!!! NICE
i live for when they are together they are great
I don't have any yellow clothes either.(not because I'm depressed or something I just don't like yellow its annoying)
omfg when dan told ella it's going to be alright, that made me so happy bc my names ella and i have had a bad day and that was all i needed so thank you so much to dan for that i love him!!!!!!
when they smile it makes me happy
🐱🐤🐥🌕🌝🌛🌜🌙💫⭐️🌟✨⚡️☀️🍌🍯🧀🏅🎖🥇🏆🏵🎗🎫🚧🌠💊💛🔅🔆〽️⚠️🚸🔱⚜️ Also dan breaking gender roles is literally what I’m living for right now😂
the only counselor available in my town or anywhere nearby is infamous for gossiping and breaking confidentiality. I need something, but I literally have no options. There are school counselors but that's not a thing I can do on a regular basis.
Dan should’ve dressed up as a French fry so they could’ve been philly cheese fries
He paints his fingers with a close precision
Why did my school not teach us about this
I just got my master's degree in mental health counseling (well almost, I am about to defend my thesis and then I will be done with my degree) and I think mental health is sooooo important! Thank you for speaking about this!! <3
Snowpiercer is my favorite movie, omg it's so under rated
#1: Answer the door. #2: Come upstairs in the cheese costume. Geez, peer pressure much? I would totally tell my bf that, I might get hit in the head for it, but she'd probably accommodate me. She's nice like that. Sometimes. Best friends are meant to torment each other. It's a fact. The fact that they can understand you is a bonus. Domesticity at its finest. Oh and  nice he ordered milkshake(s)....I mean are you even surprised anymore?
When he turns his chair to his left the screen gets more yellow and normal colored, but when he turns to the right the screen goes purple
Dan!  you can use rubbing alcohol, instead of nailpolish remover!
💛We💛love💛you💛Dan💛and💛Phil💛never💛change💛
I had a councillor at school because people took the mic out of my name and the guy didn't even know my name. It made matters worse .
My best friend had depression after being bullied, and I have anxiety. Thanks Dan, this helps to know that you care.
Omg their calendar is gonna be with the Howlter family
but what if you joke about your mental illnesses to help you cope?
Guys I need the name of the anime he recommended is it new yokyo? Help
DAN WITH PAINTED NAILS JESUS AMEN SCREE E E  LIKE IF YOU AGREE
this is one of the many reasons I love you <3
aww he was blushing so much when he spoke about phil painting his nails, this is so wholesome
omg wait, why didnt i think of this earlier? Dan x Cole, i mean imagine the beautiful babies that they would make
you should do a baking dan vs phil
my bet there is animals in the new calendar
I had such awful experiences with councilers and all my counciling experiences were so strange and didnt feel very comfortable or helpful. If you had the same problem with therapy youre not alone please dont worry. 🖤 Things will be alright.
W H O L E S O M E
People I've talked to go on about depression like it's a choice, or like it's some sin, or they think those who are depressed are weak. I try to tell them otherwise, but they go on like they know what it's all about when really, they have no clue.
Snow piercer took a lesson from Jonathan swift??? 😖
I fricking missed world mental health day AGAIN fricking hell
I literally had a breakdown over my anxiety the other day and then my mom went on a tangent on how I’m “ just trying to be cool “ and that I “ don’t have anxiety. “ god I wish people would realize that ANXIETY ISNT COOL and it’s extremely difficult to deal with.

DUDE MY BIRTHDAY WAS ON GLOBAL MENTAL HEALTH DAY AND I WAS REALLY DEPRESSED ALL DAY. No but seriously I turned 16 on the 10th and I was depressed and anxious all day.
Dan painted his nails.\nThat's it, my life is completed. I can finally die at peace.\nrip
Ballemia OCD Anxiety Depression panic disorders...I have all of the above
Your nails are such an eyecatcher 😂😁
DANS LITTLE SQUEAK WHEN LAUGHED. I C O N I C
Mate today is the 12th
Out school is shit they told us it was wmhd then just started to shout about attendance for a school trip 🙄🙄🙄😂
When I took the pottermore hat sorting quiz i got a choice between ravenclaw and slytherin!
my school didn't talk about mental health issues at all
wasn't the 10th a Tuesday?
what if the thing in the calendar is going to be a dog ???
Is there somewhere i can donate to from switzerland (not in the eu) ?
Ooo Dan throwing shade at the demons is my new kink
I wish I had a soulmate that would order me a milkshake
I actually got so sad randomly that I almost cried for no reason a few minutes ago. Do I have depression?
Still wishing you'd worn the Pooh Onesie, our cuddly wee Bear.
ARE THEY DOING A DOG CALENDER!?!?!
WTF you got the same results as Harry Potter.
I like your nails Danny boy :))
ACK I missed it, and I have mental health problems...
Is it just me or does Dan's skin look flawless in this video
blinkin eck
I noticed their voices were slightly lower in the bloopers video and I was very confused!!!
I’m loving the yellow nails 😍
Am I the only one who's still waiting for the scented candle haul ..
k but how does he blow up the balloon so easily
This is completely unrelated but there was a teacher called mr Howell who started working at my school, let’s just say that phandom in my school didn’t stop
If Dan was my therapist, he'd probably cry alongside me in the corner.
The cheese dress is back
He looks so cute in this

i suffer from anorexia, it is inspiring to hear that people care about mental illness. thank you Dan and Phil for this video. every one blames me that its my fault that I could anorexic but I never asked for this, it just arrived and now it eats away at me making me believe things that are not real. I want to get win and get better but its so hard. video's like this help to encourage people suffering, it gives them hope I guess. it makes them realise that people do care. thanks for the video guys. :)

DAN'S NAILS 😭😭😭😭😭
DANNYWISE
NAILS 💅💅
Ever since I watched the hilarious viral video How the entire world was made, I guess I had been really interested in anything on the first few centuries where the Roman, Egyptian, and Persian empires were around. All of a sudden now this game has really peaked my interest.
YOU CAN FIGHT THE EGYPTIAN GODS?!
So do I have to get it on day one to experience all the daily quests and god boss battles or can I always replay them?
this looks too awesome, i love it and cant wait for 16 days
Trials of the gods <3
DLC and the game isn't even out yet? How can I not think that they're doing that carving the game up to release it in pieces to make more money thing. Good to know that even if I shell out $60 I'm not getting the full game experience anymore.
Really excited for 'The Hidden Ones' expansion. \nI always love DLC set after the main story
i'm glad that I pre-order the gold edition then !! 100$ worth it 4sure !! thanks for hearing us UBI !!
Major props. The Season Pass for this game is actually harmless, thanks to the free content. I expected The Mummy(pretty much) stuff to be a Season Pass-only thing. But its not.\n\nAlso, I like that they're just going nuts with these time periods now. I mean really, the Egyptian Gods will be a threat? Thats awesome, and its used in a way that makes sense in the AC universe, a glitch in the Animus(I bet Juno's the cause of it).\n\nWell, Ubiosft's going to have to make an AC game set in Ancient Greek now, so the Greek Gods can be a threat. Or how about an AC game set in Japan, with Japanese Gods as threats, etc. Just go all out with the ancient time periods.
omg pls let the photo modus include videoclips! it will make the content creator side sooo much better if you are able to do own cinematics
This is going to be wayyyyyyyyyyyyy better than Syndicate !
My god this looks incredible!
Can't wait
He looks life foseytube
Hoping it doesn't suck
Let me guess thier after king tut lol
Yesssssssss
Soaking wet.
OMG I didn't know about how good the season pass was going to be. If someone gets the game free with a 1080 TI can they still upgrade to the season pass version? I upgraded my video card and monitor just for this game! Upgrading the rest of the PC once the 8700 on backorder arrives. CANT WAIT to see this game. I haven't cared about AC for years but really enjoyed syndiucate so I am giving you another chance!
Where the hell do the templars fit into this game. I mean the franchise is all about the war between assassins and templars after all.
Alright, who's the 297 jerks that disliked this video?
I’ll buy the game just to support him. AC IV was amazing, no doubt that this will be too!
As a person getting really sick of the far left, and who knows that Ashraf was (100-1 odds) put in charge of this game as a 'diversity' move, I personally like the game far more considering that he seems to have actually worked to justify his presence as director--that's an impressive show of initiative and passion.
It looks amazing i can not wait to play
When Ubisoft make a series assassin creed in Indonesian historis?
OK now do this over, but without using the word content
I already bought the standard edition and I want to upgrade to gold with out paying the $100.00 for the game that I had already bought
The more I see, the more I fall in love. I cannot wait!
Besides all this awesome stuff, I just cant wait for the soundtrack to be released too. The music on this video is epic.
Dlc-The mummy/shadow of colossus/exodus gods of Egypt vibes right here anything missing ?
I think this game will return like AC 1,2, brotherhood and Revolution or much better
This game looks incredible from the trailers. I hope they dont downscale the graphics 20% at launch but keep it as it is. Also I hope there is no bugs this time (like a guy without a face etc.) Excited!
i dont know if i can trust ubisoft again. But this looks really great. oh nooooo
the game isnt even out yet and they are doing trailers for the dlc how is this just not content taken out of the original game
Are the Roman Centurion and Horus skins both available on launch for those who got the Gold edition or will they gradually be released after launch?
DLCs are not bad they revive a game and make ppl talk about the game more earning money and players in the process so for the most part there are good but there's a difference between an honest dlc and cut content that didn't make it to final game
You can tell that these guys really dedicated themselves to this game and not produce some nonsense bullshit.
To the gold edition players
This series explanation for everything is it's an animus glitch
So you're advertising a season pass, for a game that hasn't even come out yet?
Season Pass before the release of the game?!
Man that 1:16 golden legendary bow though, it is so gorgeous. I can't w8 any longer
Jesus haven't seen a developer this passionate about their own game in a long fucking time.......really shows he's really proud of the content he's made......\n\nLong live the Creed..
This will be the best selling AC ever. Black Flag was awesome because of Ashraf Ismail, and this time he's proved that origins gonna break the records. Huge world and maps to exploration.
Shite
can't wait!! also please enable 21:9 cutscenes launch, puhlease T-T
I'm ready!
WE
How about Assassin's Creed cold mist
haha its the upside down 
can't wait to play this game!
Normally I was not intending to buy the season pass but now that I saw the DLCs I'm 100% buying it
lol man blinked every 2 seconds...
oh man I can't wait to buy the dlc after playing the full videogame! and then buying the season pass so I can play even more content when it comes out! I love being a consumer. I hope this game has microtransactions. I can't wait for the next Ubisoft™ videogame!
The Ezios Family Remix in the background is awesome!
Does anyone know if you will be able to get the season pass after the game releases separate from the other packs as I have already pre ordered the deluxe edition and don’t fancy spending £70-£80 on the gold edition
Ill wait for the definitive/goty edtion to come out
I'm not even joking when I say this has so much potential. They're going full-on RPG, taking cues from The Witcher 3, Skyrim, and even Breath of the Wild. My favorite AC game is currently Black Flag, but with how this looks, that just might change. I'm just hoping with all my heart that they don't f*ck up and disappoint all of us.
+1 if you will take gold edition or gods edition i ll take one of them
This is your last shot with me Ubisoft...do not fail me. I will pre order just because this was the team behind black flag. Be the glimmer of light in this dark time of venomous publishers and developers.
Instant buy after i saw the Well what it is? gesture in 2:18.
As soon I saw this I was like ‘Oh, Sh*t just got real.’\nI AM SOOOOO FUCKING HYPED!!!! YEAH!!! I AM SO HYPED!!
I'm telling you. The game looks like Ryse Son of Rome fighting mechanics and the modes of the Egyptian mythology while Ryse did the Roman mythology. Ryse was the best game I played and I'm happy to see them re image ACO into a Ryse concept.
Oh wow. They've actually implemented the Nome system of Greek administration for Egypt. That's some good attention to detail.
Pretty nice O_O
Assassin's Creed Origins is made with passion & lots of hard work. I think it's going to be the best game in the whole series. Ashraf Ismail has done such a great job & Egypt looks insanely beautiful in this game.
WE
Giant enemy crab!
WE
Hopefully we can get like Japan or China next,show Asians some love man,and we could finally sneak around as a ninja lol
I buy cod games every year, and im looking forward to ww2...but ive had to choose between this or cod this year and I gotta say im even more confident on going with assassins creed origins! Man i cant wait to get my hands on this game! Thanks ubisoft, u guys are ranked 2nd on my list behind rockstar games as the greatest video game makers in history!
HE SAID ANIMUS NOT HELIX YES YES YES
I caaaaan't waiiiit
typical money greedy Ubisoft. If you have a DLC trailer for a game that hasn't even been released yet, then you can add the DLC to the main game and even extend the release date. End this Season Pass nonsense you've completely brainwashed most gamers with once and for all
why does this have to come out the same day as wolfenstein :( Space out the games people..!
Can i just preorder the game with the season pass? I dont want the deluxe edition and get those good weapons because i wanna farm good weapons and armor
I know the game hasn't come out yet but I'll ask anyway. Do you think i should play ac unity and syndicate since i haven't played them or skip them and just play this?
Phát hành trên youtube vài ngày máy vậy anh
Can ubisoft make an new assassin's creed in like 2019? But the assassin's is in the Philippines,Philippines has a great history about Filipino's against Spain the Filipino's have a secret army like guys called katipunero and they are called the KKK and they fight for freedom from the Spain people and yes I'm a Filipino.
I wished this game will not have super - natural elements in it. What I got instead is huge snakes inverted arrows, now undead egyptian gods. If there are micro - transactions in it too I won't buy.
Excited about the game and the DLC but my attention comes to focus on about 50 seconds in, the The Hidden Ones poster. Take a good long look at it, can you see what I see?\nReplace Egypt with San Fransisco\nBayek with Marcus\nThe other assassin's with Sitara and Wrench\nIt's clearly a recreation of the Watch Dogs 2 box art poster!
This content should be in the main game, not be DLC for payment.
Shut up and talk about PC PORT!!!
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PRESENT DAY STORYLINE?
I like this Origins Ezio's Family tune
Remember when you would pay $60 and get the full game?
Ashraf Ismail u sold ure soul for some money.. what an unfortunate bargain
im sooo happy that i got the gold edition now
This is just wrong. Release the damn game first!! Then you can talk about the dlc. We need to enjoy the main course first before we dive in to dessert. A Shamefur Dispray.
will season pass owners be able to play the dlc's right off when we install the game?
Why do you think anybody would be thrilled to see a trailer for DLC that we have to pay for before the game is even launched?\n\nAt least the free content sounds good.
Isn't gold edition releasing on 27 October then what about the DLCs
Ok, am I taking crazy pills or do some parts of the background music sound like Ezio's Family? if they're bringing it back as main theme, I'm stoked
Why tf does Bayek have double hidden blade?
The combat before wasn't perfect but at least it made you feel like a badasss assasssin, this combat is ugly and boring
Dlc dlc and dlc. This is why i prefer piracy.
It's not free content if we're paying $60-$100. In fact, what you should be saying is Season Pass and Gold edition buyers will be receiving stolen content. Content that was intentionally removed or left out of the game, content that is supposed to be included. I'll pirate it and rate it zero stars from Amazon to Metacritic. You're greedy scum bags, I hope this game crashes and burns like Unity.
sigh look at all the likes, people are actually defending this season pass bullshit, cutting content out to be resold back to you piece by piece, this generation of gamers are happy to bend over to corporate greed and anti-consumer practices,  they deserve to be milked like this. Welcome to  gaming in 2017 enjoy buying your $60 skeleton experience.
I'm proud to announce that we've decided to rip content out of this game, and make you pay for it! I'm so proud of this, I couldn't possibly be more proud. Now pay up.\n\nNah man, y'all can keep your whack business practices.
The game isint even out and Ubiseptic tank is already advertising season pass dlc and post content? Youre really putting the cart in front of the fucking horse aren't you? Delay this game and include all this extra content in the base game at launch.
Amazing
nice undies

Ffs you bought shit,  you need fox or tld brand clothing
Find good matcjing gloves
Go to eBay for towbar
gumtree or ebay
Looking FRESH!  Yes lad.
I always enjoy watching your videos but on this one the only thing we was looking a was the ground I think you need your go pro a bit higher on your helmet, just what I think that's all lol
Muddy fox is a decent brand for mtb but you would be better with like fox or alpine stars. I wear alpine stars because they're amazing for long endure rides especially for jumps and stuff
what a little bitch? you just hurt your foot? so what...  lease you can still ride and live a normal life and not of had to have operations and long recovery, STILL recovery ill say like poor scotty cranmer...try being in his shoes mate and show some respect to him.your crash isnt serious/worth crying over, you will live, get over and fuck you
That looked so painful get well harry 😔
You look a twat in that
Range Rover comes with a tow bar 😂there is controls in the boot to release it and it folds out
Make sure you lock the bikes with a chain if you end up with a bike rack , been known for bikes to get nicked even at traffic lights when on racks
No you haven't broken your ankle it's just in a cast 🙄
Dude I work for Land Rover @champagnejolag that's my insta DM me I'll hook it up
EVOC Back packs for the win every time !!
get  universal tow bar in have a range rover and it works excellent mate
Harry those 2 holes on you tow hitch are for the safety chains on a trailer. Incase a trailer comes off the tow hitch ball, the safety chains wiith hooks stay connected and insure the trailer doesn't go into on coming traffic, hit a person or a building etc. You want a tow hitch bike rack like this. It'll slide right in to the square receiver n fastened with a big pin ..... \n https://www.etrailer.com/Hitch-Bike-Racks/Thule/TH990XT.html?feed=npn&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIofbev_jp1gIVQWSGCh1JkAubEAQYBCABEgKO2fD_BwE\nThule make good hitch racks. Hope this helps.
*HARRY hit up Cannock Chase!* Best place I've been to for Mountain Biking!!\nhttp://www.chasetrails.co.uk/

Harry, get the space brace for your ankles when you ride. They will save your ankles! Also help you get revived.
I am so glad harry is keeping it like his channel in stead of worrying about youtubes rules! Cheers!
you can purchase a bike rack that just sicks right into the square hole in the back.
its a bit shit mate, got to a mountain bike specific store and there get you the baller shit you need man!
That was one of the funniest vids I've ever seen!! Good start with the Enduro gear, just stay away from Spprts Direct next time. Have a ganders at Endura clothing on Chain Reactin Cycling.

Harry!!!! You don’t need glasses bro, just bang on a sick set of goggles with your full face 😜
Why don't you get a roof rack for the bike
thumbs up for nandos (SA for the win)
There is a tow hitch already on it. Just removed that plastic blocking the hitch and you can use your bike rack.
the riding shorts are good  but maybe invest in better jerseys, those ones look like they are for cross country, also an enduro helmet would help.. For example ( troy lee designs A2 helmet) having longer shorts is better too,  the jacket is good.
for your towbar try Caravan and Camping/ towers in southport
You have a hitch on your Sport already mate.  All you need is a bike rack now, it will go right into the existing receiver.\n\nSomething line this would work https://www.roofbox.co.uk/scripts/rbvehsel4_tab.php/car-specific-accessories/buzz_rack_bb4_4_bike_wheel_support_rack_no_brp304/Qx%40w%2C6M42VAwp3%40Rb%7B~cC4ure5HXEB\n\nGood luck with the ankle and the date bro!
Nice little fear and loathing in Las Vegas look! Yesslad
Get a tld Jersey they're the best
Holy shit mate, i sprained my ankle on a second degree and y have a friend that hurt it 4th degree, and now you!, we were joking that hurting your ankle was the new trend. Its fkin nuts. What up with the global energy or wtf is going on, too many synchrinicities
A Thule should just slide right into that hitch that's already on your car. And I'd definitely get a neck brace for downhill riding. If you go head first into a tree without one you'll for sure fuck ur shit up.
The square in the middle is the tow hitch receiver...typically you'd slide a trailer hitch w/ ball mount in there to tow a trailer, but they make bike racks that slide right in there as well, similar to this  https://cdn1.static-tgdp.com/ui/productimages/approved/std.lang.all/90/45/t2_classic_wloc_9044_9045_sized_750x492.jpg
You already have a receiver hitch, which is the squareish opening back there, which is what all bike racks insert into anyways. Get a North Shore style rack or a tray rack. North Shore mounts the bikes so the sit vertically long ways. Tray rack they just sit by the wheels horizontally. North Shore rack would be my personal opinion any day as you can hold way more bikes and they don't extend out so bloody far, so they are sturdier and more compact so that you're less likely to back into things.
You already have a towing receiver. Just buy a bike rack that fits your (guessing) 2inch receiver.
Harry you need a hitch bike rack. You already have the hitch you just need the rack not a tow bar. US price is less than $100
get  full face helmet with the remove able chin piece there better for enduro type riding
Don’t get a Thule get a North shore rack they are much better
buy a thule bike rack or a roof rack for the MTB it will look steeazy and its not half that expensive
stretch the other side of your ankle.
check out the online store chain reaction cycles
You have a hitch receiver. Just get a 2 rack.  🤘
You should have gotten the TLD or FOX gear
Most hilarious video in a while or maybe I am just in a good mood.\nI feel Harry is back to having tonnes of fun and just doing things he loves!\n\nVery good to see my man, cannot wait to watch you shred some enduro in your new get up!
Go on chain reaction cycle if you want good deals on any mtb stuff
Hahahaha the ginger part. Sounded like u said shall I edit that hahahahahahah. Hilarious
I enjoy the mountain bike videos
your fucking quality man videos are sick.
for outdoor sports stuff go to decathlon if there is one near you not sports direct
Riding gear is right I'd just go to a local bike shop
hi harry i have some downhill trousers and a top you can have . the top is a large and the trouser are a small to medium they were only used a couple of times . they are in good nic. let me know if you want them
Check out the Bell Super 3R helmet. It's a half shell but has a chin bar that you can attach and detached. Means when your confidents goes up you can remove the chin bar.
Hope his ankles alright but him hitting that tree was fantastic 😂
I feel you pain. Always did my feet and ankles. In the end I just permanently rode with 661 ankle braces on. Made a big difference in pain management and feeling confident. You're totally killing it on the MTB by the way 👍
As an MTBer who did some homework, I recommend Osprey back/hydration packs, camelback is the big name but osprey are better thought out, Chain Reaction are a good start point, another top tip, join British Cycling for £20 2nd get 10% discount at CRC, have saved myself a fortune
Shimano do a great hydration pack and alterations or funkier clothing is good
any fox mtb clothing are the best, for winter I've just bought the fox downhill polar pants and a gore-tex waterproof jacket......best mtb gear purchases i have made! For a full face i suggest the POC Coron...rated for multiple impacts so you can crash it a lot and you'll survive
10:48 i lost my shit holy fuck that was funny xD
bro you should make your own cry down hill gear shoes the lot job will look sick
The central square hole under the bumper is the main armature part of a tow bar(the expensive bit!), you have the electrics fitted too (black plastic thing to the right of square with sprung lid!). I doubt that you have the plug in part with the hitch under the floor in the boot (it's too big to fit under the floor, old ones used to attach differently and fit under the floor). Go to LR Supermarket in Speke, they can sort you with the bit that's missing (I have the adjustable height removable bar on my RR) - also they sell Thule bike racks - the 'tilting' ones are recommended cos you can still open the boot with bikes on the rack!
Budget is best sometimes man ruin it re buy :)
For your enduro rides you should def get a pair of bib shorts. Basically a Lycra suspender shorts but it has a pad in and stops any chafing. \n\nIt took me years to start wearing them. It it's the best thing I ever did.
giro switchblade is a pretty good helmet for enduro and dh
Osprey hydration packs are really good I’ve had one for a year and it’s really good
Towbars are normally a few hundred quid. Just shop around at scrap metal places and stuff or CES or euro car parts. They will certainly have something for you
An easy way to remember what you need to do is called R.I.C.E.  R- rest I- ice C- compression & E- elevation. If you do that you’ll heal quicker.
Get roof bars fitted by a Land Rover specialist not Land Rover themselves and then get a roof rack for the bikes
You need to get a ute to put your bikes on the back
Why don't you get someone to fabricate one lad
I sprained my ankle really badly and wrapped it up tight to stop it flopping about when on crutches. Turns out it's not the best thing to do according to NHS
And there is a channel on YouTube callGMBN that is all about mountain biking and everything you need to know when you are starting off
Such an expensive vehicle I would go the dealer to get the tow Barr
everything i  hear is ''I want to go see it again'' OK i get it
Me encanta el video y  también la canción like si a ti también 😍😍😊😉

My daughter is in preK this year--she's one of 3 girls in a class of about 12-15. Yup, that's 3 girls and 9-12 boys. Her besties are all boys. Only down side is them teaching her to root for the wrong team--she came home today cheering for the Buckeyes when we're a Bobcat family! Austie [Austin] taught me that is apparently enough explanation. LOL.
Preschool?! You go girl!
OMG THAT FIRST VIDEO JOSH PLAYED THO 😂😭😂
I'm kinda here - Grant 2017\nI love this

Poor Josh XD
6:23 what the hell
That screaming laughter 😂
Not the superhero we deserve but the one we needed
Mike Diva is a genius.
This is my favorite one haha poor Anna cleaning at the end
LA is so extra I love it.
So disapointed. Was in the metro with a bicycle, waiting for Super Kind Girl to appear. She never came. 😭😭😭😭
Oh, Mika and Anna. Never change.
California is going to become the meme and anime state soon
Is this PC Music?
Anna is so cute omg
These ads are creative af. Most unexpected and wonderfully executed! 10/10
this is a superhero we need
Wooow Excellent job Metro!\nfinally a message that encourages respect for passengers and defends them from other rude passengers. There is no courtesy or kindness in many people in the public transportation system, and it is not an exaggeration but, yes, they behave like monsters.
I LOVED THIS. Mike & Anna are awesome.
I wish we could have that in France !! Ahah I love it !
Now do one for those a-holes who stand right outside the train doors and try to get on without letting people off. Basic elevator/subway etiquette, people! heh
God who the fuck is negind this!? It's brilliant.
日本関係ねぇじゃんwww
I just love this.
Is this Hannah Diamond in disguise
Super Kind needs to wait until everyone is off the train before barging in.
Wow. I love it. \nBut 通路除外 doesn't mean blocking. I think it's 通路妨害. And not ブロキング, ブロッキング is correct.
普通にかわいい曲で好きだわ
train and bus in Japan, also, SuperKind is needed.
More California/Japan fusion! SuperKind is the best. More please! And T-Shirts!
I love Superkind videos, make more! ...and do Full, long songs of already created. Pls ;)
Dude wha's this for?  Anyway I love this super crazy n cool KAWAII ;)
I want the beam she can use.
And we continue to stigmatize bicyclists. Super kind should have used her words and found out why the eyeball monster wasn't standing clear of the aisle. Even eyeball monsters like to go with the flow, unfortunately sometimes there are situations that interfere. This PSA is a misguided social pressure call to action, how about stigmatizing the people that stand where the bikes are supposed to go?
this is a milestone for modern culture
So much better than most music videos!
Nice
I would totally buy a pre-transformation Super Kind t-shirt.
Where can I buy my Super Kind shirts and other merchandise? This is brilliant.
LOL this got to russian news headliners
The next clip in Moscow
que dice la supa kain cuando mira al rude dude ?? jaja no cacho unaxDD
I don't think you understand the people you're trying to target with these ads.
Lol
Aesthetics
heheheheheh))))
Bahahaha ❤️ this
k...
Convinced me.
I love Mike diva stuff
Omfg that end!!!
ANNA IS QUEEN!!!
wtf, i'm japanese, so i can't understand what happen in this commercial video XD\nbut this dim metro and pop girl contrast is actually too fun!!\n日本のイメージってこんなんなの・・・・\nまぁ良いか、テンタメの都ロサンゼルスだし。\n俺がグリフィス天文台からホテルの帰りにこの地下鉄乗ったときは、黒人の兄ちゃんが箱にお菓子入れて売り歩いてたなぁ\n駅も車内も薄暗くて、人もまばらだから余計このポップなCMが浮いてるというか・・・ｗ
My new favorite anime !
well actually 除害 is correct not 除外..
Never in Russia
Why is it in Japanese?
Only a nobody walks in L.A. public transportation is a mobile apt. For the schizo-homeless
I do think its weird that you have Spanish announcements in the US. Doesn't it make sense that people speak a country's first language when they want to live there?
Why it is in Japanese?
Mike Diva making the world a better place by bringing artistic integrity to ice cream ads and PSAs
I wanna do her
超親切のダサさは異常
え、何で日本語なの？\n皆分かるの？
日本..
No surprise it's a man because women are never rude and inconsiderate.
I liked the part where Kylo Ren tells Rey, Wow you are The Last Jedi. Sorry I killed your dad, Luke Skywalker.
Those porg eyes are NOT going to last long, Jenny.
The hell were you doing to that Porg? Masturbating its eyes?
you don't get a prosthetic face... that doesn't make any sense Watch GITS....   that being said, the black patch could just be something like a futuristic plaster or something... from the lightsaber fight with Rae
I jerked off my R5 to the new trailer.
What's your favorite Star Wars fllm?
Sitting here hoping Jenny is going to go Full Paige (Netflix 'Atypical' for those who missed the reference) on the Porg toy!!!!
I avoided watching this trailer after Johnson's and Hamill's warning. Watching this reaction video somehow feels like a decent compromise between abstaining and watching it. I'm looking forward to seeing Kylo's face mesh in the theater.
The Porg seems to be permanently unhappy. : (
Wow, a real reaction thats not an overreaction, thank you for this Jenny. :)
Oh god all the uncreative RLM comments have migrated....
This is the best.
Funniest reaction video i've seen. Really apathetic and ironic whilst also being a giant piss take of all the reaction vids about. Love it 😂
After spending over a decade living on a desert planet, Rey has to jump into an ocean and swim so she does. She out-swims all of the local sea creatures but on her SECOND attempt, NOT her first because #NotAMarySue
Max Landis brought me here ❤️
I love all your content, and I think you're awesome! But I'm really writing to tell you know that I think your horse is The true embodiment of Black Beauty from the movie. 😁
I agree with you that trailer reactions are silly , but I mostly think they're stupid
Palpatine was set to wear Golden clothing on the previous movies , dont mock snoke.  didnt you join the SW showmoedown
Oh baby, I'd love you  so much, and post-coital would be a trip to the stars! Plus. I'd like to nibbke your feet
I think it's some sort of bandage. The scar is different later.
Every time Jenny rolls up her sleeves, take a shot.\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, so it only happens a few times. Drinking is bad umkay.
In a bold move to finally tie animated Star Wars to live Star Wars, Disney will make Rey the lovechild of Ezra and Sabine.
Many it's like a weird looking Band-Aid.
Lol this review is so sarcastic and passive aggressive, and taking shots at literally everyone, but then again your like calm and nice. So I am really confused
I don't think it's actually mesh under his skin. I think he's just wearing a cool techno bandage. You know, he just has a particular taste in bandages that he thinks is cool.
It’s like Ellie’s new tattoo. The ultimate cosplayers got it tattooed lol
I figured it was a cyber-bandage thing of some sort
I found I had more of a reaction when I tae a shit then I did when I watched trailer. The 1 thing that the trailer are my movement was alt of urrr, ugh, groan and grrrr's
You and rich evans have two different opinions on how to use a porg doll.
This is hardly a reaction video
The Mesh Thing as you call it, is most likely a Bacta (Star Wars Magic Medicine) patch used for healing wounds on the go, since this movie is supposed to take place right after the last one according to the director. I'm guessing he is feeling like a failure after his loss to Rey and wants to get right back out there in the fight and slaps it on his face instead of going home to lick his wounds for a while. Then by the end of the film, it will come off. Think future face grow back bandaid.
Is that your daughter's room or do you still live like a 12 year old?
How can she hate Rogue One and be excited for TLJ?
You're trying to say figuratively blind. Watching Archer helps.
Last shot of Kylo, could be from the flashback at Jedi academ wood-shop failure. And Kylo stoic? I don't know your humor, was that sarcasm or confusion, cuz everyone calls him emo Kylo. :)
the mesh is a space bandage.
I think it's just a space band-aid on his face
How funny, you are silly, and cute, but a little silly, I think I mentioned that already, not sure I trust those porgs though, what someone else called an egguin, a term I like, but I can't wait to see the movie, mesh scars and all, force be with you.
Jenny, is your left sleeve okay?
I thought it was a space band-aid
i do not do reaction
Your reaction was cool, seriously. But Tyrone Magnus was better ijs
I want to see a Jenny Nicholson/Red Letter Media cross over.  I think their senses of humor would compliment each other nicely.
That stuff is not under Kylos skin I don’t think. It looks likes a band aid almost
Make a video about  Andy Signore.
It baffles my mind people watch this...
who cares if he has a gold robe? What's the big deal? What's to dislike? It may be part of his character development. Who cares. The nitpicking about every little thing is getting to the point that I just can't watch this type of crap anymore. There's NOTHING of value in these videos. Just people doing absolutely nothing, saying absolutely nothing, talking shit about things they'll never come close to accomplishing themselves and so what the fuck is the point? You watched a trailer that we also watched, wow, guess we need a video about it? What's going on in the world? Why are we all choosing entertainment that's duller, less interesting, has less substance and doesn't bring anything new to anything. That's our world today. Watching people watch other videos and then bitch about them. WTF!?
Biased against the poor Foxes because you don't personally like them?... SMH ;)
I was a huge fan of the part when the Porg opened up his mask only to reveal another Porg saying, Now, I am The Last Jedi.
I assumed it was a bacti strip to accelerate healing and minimize scarring. If that's the case, then he's obviously wearing it at the beginning of the movie, which is when I think the space battles take place.
If Luke and Anakin can get robot hands that look like normal hands why can't kylo ren get his scar repaired or pull a handsome Jack and have a hologram over it
She is so weird and awkward...yet I still want to bang her.
I HAVE SCREWS IN MY LEG, TOO!!
Yippee, another star wars movie. I can't wait to be disappointed by another average movie hyped to infinity.
Are you underage, why all the fluffy toys?
I can't find last week's millennial falcon. when are you gonna release it Jenny?
The Porg marketing for children is clearly working.
If I wrote the new trilogy I would see the OT events as WW1 and this new one as WW2. The Empire being Nazi Germany. \n\nStar Wars would be like basically what would happen if humanity colonized most of the galaxy 1000 years ago and the the events shown in the movies are the 20th century but set against the whole galaxy background not just earth.
It's not there the whole time.
The scar looks like some Kevlar tape bought from Amazon stuck on his face.
Torn between avoiding the trailer and watching this video.\n\n*Finally breaks down and watches this video*
Finally. An honest trailer reaction. I'm glad you didn't cry when you heard Luke speag. Or scream like a porg at the end shot. Or surmise the entire plot from a 2 minute clip of film that might not be in the film.
Your mother has a screw in her leg?  She is more machine now, than mother. Twisted and evil.
I would be very interested to see your analysis of the Steven Moffat era of Doctor Who, if that's something you are familiar with. Although it may be too much of a complete mess to even attempt analyzing...
It's not fun watching someone complain about entertainment
PLEASE MAKE OUT WITH THE PORG ON YOUR NEXT VIDEO!
The whole flick is a comedy!
LOL
Great video.
That Kylo ren  doll is creepy af
Eff the redemption arc. Kylo gots to die.
Watched 10x before lighting up.
What eats porgs?
*gasp
Reaction starts at Never:Clickbait
LOL
#PorgLife
the metal mesh represents a small step towards kylo's machine. \nhe's more machine now than man.
That was surprisingly fun. I kinda enjoy reaction videos (although I always keep in mind that this trend is a tad depressing, sociologically speaking), but yours was one of the rare believable ones I've seen... ^^; Some people are good at it, whatever it is, and some aren't, some have lives, some are men-children with the emotions of five year-old girls. In any case, I like your humor.
If Vader was Jenny's dad he'd try to force choke me to death every time he reads my mind because of my impure thoughts towards his daughter..
It kinda doesn't work to criticize trailer reactions while running with a Droopy-the-dog schtick as pretentious as this. Just putting that out there.
Our allegedly strong female lead with the line Just show me my place in all this worries me.  A strong character has goals and at least an idea of the path they want to take.  Rey kinda just bumbled her way through The Force Awakens too.
Is she for real?
God I can’t stand this girl
No, I definitely do not need this.... sorry. But your command of the obvious is really firm.
Mr Sunday Movies does this better.
Trailer reactions are silly, you are so right. Most of them should be called trailer overreactions.
God I hate you
Her attractiveness is approaching 5000.
If you really want to see cringe reactions in their purest form, type ComicBookCast2 trailer reactions. The guy who does those reactions is like Tommy Wiseau of trailer reactions.
Other people are having fun in ways I disapprove of. You should only have fun in the same way I do.
You are so perfect, and I would, still, say that if I could only hear you on the radio,...... or something stupid like that.
I love the Porgs too
No. The last shot is a flashback. And that fire behind him matches up with the scene where Luke is digging himself out of the rubble.
I clapped when I looked at the comment section and everyone said they clapped, because I know that reference too!
I'm so sorry to admit this, but I fap to Jenny all the time.
Also quit Shitting on trailer reactions. People like the crew at Blind Wave, for instance,  work very hard on their content, know their stuff, are intelligent, and their responses show this. People want to see fans like THEM react to things they are equally fans of, as well as hear their subsequent opinons on the matter. Your invalidation of this is very narrow.
The only The Last Jedi Trailer Reaction you need.. *to avoid*
You think I look funny? HARD TO TAKE SERIOUSLY!!!!! WHAT!!!!!!!! although I have to thank you for calling me fashion forward I do like my Gold Robe but I'm supremely intimidating I'm not funny other than that this amused me
I love you.
What are your thoughts on Mike Ditka's comments?
Mike ditka knows bc he lives a black persons life right? Idk wat it's like to be white bc I'm not. Smdh
needs pull his head out of his ass  their is assault on free speech to disrespect all vets who served to protect all the constitution  disrespectful is what ditka is if he wants to live in a society that tells you what  to think leave go to fuckig russia leave America to real free  speekers
Dicta is old,out of date,out of touch,and  racist
Fuck espn that's why your rating are failing you guys suck!,,,💩💩💩💩💩💩🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿
Max, wtf are you talking about? Just sit back and say, I got your back bro. Then just stfu.
He can't see what's normal to him ,this the way he was raised , he's just saying this is the way things should be and stay   The George Wallace mentality....
Oh, stop the drama you knee-jerk black supporters and blacks.  You've never had it so good.  TV shows full of joking, leg-slapping nigros, Ebonics accepted on every level now so much that blacks are going to STAY IGNORANT another 50 years.  The media are perpetuating your jive-ass business.  Who are your heroes?  Sports figures?  Rappers?\n\nYOU HAVE IT BETTER THAN EVER!   And all in the face of having less aptitude for western accomplishment than others.  \n\nONE IN EIGHT of us are black.  Let's not get carried away with how important we are.\n\nYou blacks ignore that you had a period in the fifties and sixties in which you didn't abandon your families, didn't pop babies in every womb you get near, didn't dance and shuck like monkeys at any possible chance.
Mike Ditka is still dam IGNORANT where in the he'll he been living at & he don't believe the BS either....REALLY one stupid MF where was he in the 60's up to now No respect for this fool
It's 2017- if you have the means and America is so horrible, especially if you feel legitimately oppressed- please leave. But don't tell me these spoiled millionaires are oppressed. It's just a political construct openly used by socialists, and yes Communists, to tear down existing institutions. And ironically, the tension heats up when the Democrats lose. Yes, African Americans have played a major part in US history, and they should be heard. But I resent this talking point that America was built by slaves as if the rest of the population was just sitting around living the good life while black folks were doing all the work. A small percentage of colonists owned slaves and I have a strong suspicion that Mike Ditka's ancestors weren't even in the US prior to 1900. Ditka's from the old school, where men were men and women were women, and all decent people showed a little gratitude for their blessings.
And it's been a lot longer than 100 years that they haven't been oppressed
Mike Ditka has always been one of the good ole boys. Ditka hasn't seen oppression in the last 100 years.... Because we all know that his old ass was there. Lol
Sports and politics should never mix.  Education and respect are the keys to coexistence.
his name is mike dickhead dumb as dog shit
Mike is a Punk.
Mike ditka, dumbest asshole i have ever seen. Which country have you been living in the past 60 years you dumb monkey. Typical answer from a white son of a bitch racist. No disrespect to other white ppl who are cool with us colors.
Sometimes when old white men get a camera in front of them..they can't help but let their Real Rasict views leak out....
Dear max and Stephen\nOppression hits everyone \nWhat u need to be saying is it’s not what u know it’s who I know in this world the end and that goes for everyone cause there are succesful black people wealthy black oeople\nPlease stop talking about only black slavery other races have been enslaved also in recent years to
Keep it up douche number one and douche number two. This is exactly why ESPN is losing subscribers and viewers. May it continue until ESPN no longer exists.
Willful Ignorance describes racists people. It's really not ignorance but rather ignoring what is right before their blinded eyes and deceived minds and wicked hearts. Repent and follow JESUS CHRIST everyone. AMEN.
Max can be the next Tim Wise. He is the most intelligent white guy on Tv and he spits knowledge all the time on various issues with all races. He has been the best replacement on First Take. And the reason why his takes are sometimes blacker than Stephen A, because Stephen A lets Max speak to white people so it can be heard. Great job Max I wish other people took the time you did to learn black history and hip hop. Lol
There it is again.....what did black people build in this country? Can someone PLEASE tell me what black people have built in this country?
ESPN is just a Leftist American People Hating Network.\nI will no longer watch them. ESPN is Just a bunch of Race Baiting Leftist Commies.
I'm not white!!!!!!!
you guys so full of shit
Bla Bla bla. Someone get this black man a tissue. Drama drama drama. Blacks these days are such babies. The crying, belly aching and hitting everyone with the race stamp. Fuck your race. Your race is the least interesting race on the planet. You have no race, gangstas, rappers, ebonics and Crack heads. This is why blacks are over the top drama queens. Everything they are about, is fake. Boring as hell. The few blacks that are great people forget they are black and are reminded by the most low self esteemed bottom dwellers on the planet. Yes you kanya. I had to look up your name because it's not worth remembering.
Well, like Delanie Walker told fans...BYE !! It's too late to attempt to bring fans back, with fake patriotism. We don't buy it. You're not oppressed, your immature. You're not heroes to us, the men and women wearing the flag are. We look up to them, but aren't looking at you at all. You turn your back on the country that gives you everything, well we turn our backs on the league that gives back nothing. While you took your knee, we took our stand.
Does my guy know that 100 years would take him back to 1917?..............How are these guys allowed to even say such dumb shit
Hey look!  The liberal media hating on an old white man again!  Say it isn't so!
How did the two Black men get through all the oppression and arrive to where they are? \nEither they got there on the merit of their true qualifications or it was afforded them by Affirmative Action and Civil rights.\nIf it was by the two latter then they are examples of reverse discrimination and was given an unearned gift at a more qualified competitors expense. CONGRATULATIONS if they achieved success by true qualification and merit and not by racial preference, and they would be evidence of what can be done through merit.\nCharacter rather than skin color said someone.\nWorking for success is time consuming and not easy, having it given for racial preference is much easier but it is not an achievement.
@Travis Simon, I have no beef with you bruh cause ur black, but i can show ur wet and soft looking ass , that i will bring it to you live if you really want it. Keep playing like this shit is a joke if you want to....
Fuck Mike and fyi I bought your game as a kid and in the voice of the rock it was a hot peace of dog shit
Max is passionate about fairness...Mike Ditka is another 50's guy, he has no clue...and I agree with the person who said Buddy Ryan was the true coach of that team in '85...Ditka is as clueless as our president,    keep on justasinger54
Mike Ditka is a gum chewing meathead.
get over it
I'm right and if you disagree then you're ignorant and racist. Fascist liberal logic 101. Sorry, I have no sympathy for black power saluting America was never great felons. Burn in Hell NFL!
Is this white guy , a historian ?
Ditka needs to start his own Confederate team.  We are over 75% of the league so he needs to take the part of the 25% who might have his mindset and start his league, (he probably would get enough to start league of 4 or 5 players.
The NFL is done. FUCK THE NFL!
FUCK MIKE DITKA, he's an asshole now, always has been, and always will be. \nSigned, \nEducated white boy
ditka's o'l ass needs 2 SHUT UP AN (WHEEL HIS O'L ASS AROUND IN THA NURSING HOME AN  JUST LOOK AT THE YOUNG PRETTY NURSES AN SEE IF( I SAID IF HE CAN GET A  RISE OR GET IT UP)!  AKA 'SHUT-UP BITCH
I think it's ridiculous that Stephen A Smith is so ignorant that he feels he can make his own comments and feel his own way about an issue but yet if someone disagrees with them then automatically he starts throwing the hate bag at them. It's just the most blatant display of ignorance you can possibly see
Ditka is a fool but the young black men of Chicago have made it a war zone. They need to grow and take responsibility for their lives. Until that happens how can you blame everyone else for your problems?
It's alright for Stephen A to spread racist but fired Mike Ditka for telling the truth that's why I don't watch ESPN the racist network
Ditka: There's been no oppression, that I know of, in the last 100 years.\nUSA:   Uhhhhh.... what was that, Mike?\nDitka: Let me clarify: There's been no oppression, that's happened to me, in the last 100 years.\n             I'm really 100 years old. My bad.
Geez did Dikita not know why all those people were being assassinated in the 60's??
Ditka, I can’t believe you said that after The Fridge, Payton, Singleterry and the rest of those Black intellectual human beings made you famous.  You sucked as a player and a coach.  They won the games and you received the credit!!!!!!!!!!
Mike Ditka is a draft-dodging POS.  Just fucking die old man.
Why in the world would any Black American protest the Symbol and Anthem of the AMERICA That Saved them from Slavery. America saved you!!! \nREAD IT:\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\n\nWhat you just read is the foundational message from AMERICA to all Blacks.\nIt just took the White folk a 100 years or so to submit to Americas Message of Freedom and Liberty.\nBy Protesting Americas Anthem your are Protesting against the one who SAVED YOU AND GAVE YOU FREEDOM.
Mike Ditka is just plain wrong. Too bad because I used to like the guy. Denying something is not going to solve the problem. The people in sports, that are attempting to bring awareness about a problem in America, are putting thier jobs and future on the line. They want America to be better. People like Ditka want it to be like it was.
Remember the good ole days when ESPN only showed highlights and sports contests? Let's make ESPN great again too
He hasn't been alive for 100 years. see that's that bs
race problems in America Whites hate blacks blacks hate whites. When will it ever end.
Wow, Max went all in.  Steven A. folds again.
maybe he means cfl ... canadian football ... not africa lol...
I never liked Mike Ditka.  He's always been an arrogant old racist bigoted nutcase.
Racist minorities always make false accusations of racism and oppression in order to GET something for free, or get AWAY WITH something scott free.  \n\nIt's always about GETTING, or getting away WITH, on the false premise of revenge for slavery.\n\nSlavery will always be the excuse for it, and anyone who resists the LIE will be falsely labeled as a Nazi racist KKK cracker.
It's The Truth all of you GO BACK TO AFRICA YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE RACE MIXING IS WRONG JUST ASK CASHES CLAY BIRDS OF A FEATHER.
End Affirmative Action and turn off Obama's schilling ESPN
ditka is a product of the racist rape factory, ped state \n\nputting a microphone in front of him is like interviewing a racist steak
first give Mike D credit for telling how he n others ignorant ,,dog smelling pig skin racist feel,,,now that's a racist comment ,,,but this what's got to stop,,it's not ment for every Caucasian ,,but only for the ignorant,,that the Elite created,,an it's time for ppl to wake up ,,,an realize who put it in affect,,,to keep ppl at odds,,,when weather gets bad,,everyone trying to help each other ,,which is how it should be,,because the system is worser than the weather!!
More liberal narrative....'racism is evrywhere'...'Trump is bad'....all to keep the black voters from jumping ship...sad ,blacks complain of oppression yet keep voting for the party that has done nothing for them
Hell, the bears have been oppressed the last 32 years. What is he talking about?
MIKE DICK is a fucking ignorant old fashion fart that's stuck in the 50s an is never gonna get it period
protesting the national anthem and our flag is the wrong way to go about what is being sought. Arlington National Cemetery is full of soldiers graves, Black and White, at least give them their due, we owe them.
We just had the first black president and he sucked ass so now all the blacks are pissed off at Trump. Obama couldnt even come close to reducing the 1/3 of black males who go to prison. Your black race is way behind in maturity and is not ready to lead a civilized country period end of story. This isnt a football game or a basketball game this is serious shit where we have enemies with nuclear bombs and terrorists. This shit is a joke we have athletes now who think they know how best to run a country. This is not the time for social experiments.
Ditka is representative of all the white people who still deny racism exists.\nIt's not that they really believe such garbage, it's that they are afraid that if they ADMIT there is a problem, that they will end up losing their privilege.\nThey would rather continue denying the truth so long as they are never forced to do anything about it.
It just shows that Mike Ditka is a ignorant ex football player/coach that's a racist. Plz keep standing and say racist shit so we know who u honky's are. If I was friends with him as a black man our relation would be over
Can't Have The Racist History without its DISCIPLES
kellerman is a liberal clown who always plays the bitch card and agrees with everything SAS says
Holy fuck I don’t like the kneeling during the national anthem but no oppression in the last 100 years? That’s fucking crazy.
we at espn think mike ditka uses 'classic kkk language', what do you think? well espn i think you can go fuck yourselves
Man Trump is letting all our heros come out the racist closet
Martin Luther King, a preacher who preached non-violence, was murdered 49 years ago. A man in his 40s was alive when his peers & parents were actively committing terrorism in the name of racism. This is the dumbest most racist & idiotic shit I've heard since this morning reading Trump tweets.
When did First Take become CNN/FOX News? Smh.
Fuck Mike Dicka...always knew he was a Racist. Fuck him!!!
Mike just needs to die please Mike die you piece of shit and let me know we're he is buried so I can piss on his grave die Mike die Mike!
I *was* a Packer Backer but now I LOVE MIKE DITKA.  At least he's got courage and conviction and he stands up to the pantie waist cry babies who turned a great game political.\nNFL can all stop playing for all I care, I won't watch.
Typical ignorant rich white guy. Your time is over guys, you generation is getting old and dying off. Just go off into the sunset you willfully ignorant fools.
I, at one time loved ESPN, Mike and Mike was my favorite all time sports show on radio and TV.  I even liked Stephen A. and Skip B.  ESPN has become the CNN of sports talk media.  Cancelling my Direct TV today.  Will never watch ESPN again. (Espn don't want whiteys support or viewership), WISH GRANTED.  Pretty much done with the NFL.

You don't like it ?  Leave the country?    There is a reason that those words are said time and time again.    The main reason is that people knows that those words hurts.    If you show someone your weakness then they will attack it.     If you stop worrying about what a football coach says and start worrying about providing for your family then the world will be a better place.     Sticks and Stones can break my bones but words will never hurt me.    White folks know how to push buttons because everyone who isn't White gets buttsore over words.   Call a White Man any name under the Sun and he will probably laugh about it,  call a black man a reggin niknits and all hell breaks loose.      Sticks and Stones will hurt a lot worse than being called a cracker.   Lol Has anybody ever gotten mad at being called a cracker.    Go to a black section of town and yell out  How are Y'all Porch Monkeys doing ?   and see if you don't get beat to a pulp.   Go to the White section of town and Yell Out  How are Y'all Honkeys doing?       Black,  Hispanic, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese. .... all of you people need to get more clever with your name calling because I know Y'all can do way better.    Look at how creative Black Men are with music. ......surely someone can come up with something better than  Cracker    .     White Folks don't get mad when you call us names.
I totally agree with Steven A, and I am from Chicago and I am a huge Ditka fan but this ignorance really hurts the mind.  Sorry Ditka but if your mindset is that far out of wack then I cannot support you.
Ro Fu your a fool has nothing to do with communism or capital has to do with basic human rights which you clearly missed. Kneeling before the flag doesn't disrespect it in any way. Many times people kneel in prayer or reverence. However when Kap or all these other player kneel they want you and these other people to take notice. Rather than sit down kneeling is a way to show respect but still protest. It's amazing that a act this simple doesn't affect the game at all could be such a problem. He and others clearly said they don't hate this country or the army. This issue with the flag seems to have triggered people like you but that is not our message it is  that we don't like the direction our country is headed.  No one seems to speak anymore thanks to your president Donald that we want cop killing to stop ! COPS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SHOOT SOMEONE AND JUST GET A SLAP ON THE WRIST WHITE OR BLACK. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FLAG YOU ALL ARE BEING FOOLED TRUMP IS TRYING TO DISTRACT EVERYONE FROM THE REAL ISSUES. HE IS TRYING TO DIVIDE THIS NATION AND YOU GUYS ARE LETTING HIM WIN. It's sad truly it is

The flag is a symbol of a country where non violent protest is a basic freedom. To protest honors the flag. Strategically I think protests during the anthem are wrong because the protest becomes the issue instead opening up a national discussion about police over reach.
A racist old white guy...what else is new.
Black ppl aren't OPPRESSED!!! TF? We have plenty of rights and can do whatever we want

12/10/17 - #45 ON TRENDING !?!? lol this trending because of Harvey? lol
waaaaay fuck weinstein pizzagate is real boiiiis
Oh my god, the hammer pulled you off? xD
For all the people saying the voice doesn't fit the character, thats the point dipshits, its a joke.
Korgs voice is great expectation subversion. you'd expect him to have a deep low voice, but he doesn't. and he's quite eloquent too.
korg is my favorite now. god bless this weird rock man.
The voice is unique and I love it. Kinda reminds me of Alpha from UP. You’d expect a badass voice from a badass character but you’re instantly surprised by how it really sounds
Y’all complaining bout the voice doesn’t fit the character but not appreciating the pure brilliance of a gay sex joke in a Marvel 🎥.
Take notes, Fox! Kevin Feige/his crew can make a better *Thing* than your 4 failed attempt/boring/corny ass movies! LOL!
ragnarok they said , movie gonna be dark they said ...oh well i just hope it wont flop
Either I’ve grown up or marvel has gotten so corny my fucking god what did they do to korg?!?!?! He can’t seem to pull enough quips fast enough apparently and you can hardly understand what he was saying.
Knew the director would screw the movie. Just like Bay and Transformers. Korg better have some good fighting skills to compensate 4 that inaccurate voice the director so stupidly gave him.
You guys do realize that this is not The Thing but in fact Korg, right?
Beached bro
Really that's his voice? Why would they even do that?
Where can i find this Stand up comedy?
Stupid accent for Korg, doesn't even match up with the animation and the accent in general sucks, couldn't even tell at first what he was saying. How the hell does the hammer rode you on your back become damma rude you on yus beck? \n\nStupiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid
IT'S CLUMBERING TIME!
Not enough quips
I don't think they filled the quota of 5 jokes per minute yet. Quick get him another quip.
Yes! I knew the thing was in this!
I'd be fine with the voice if it sounded like he was trying but it's clear someone really didn't give a fuck about Korg
Why the fuck have Marvel allowed Taika to make Thor into a parody of himself? This looks horrible.
This scene is not funny. Fuck i think blade runner had funnier scenes than this.
That sounds nothing like Korg
That's strange. Jim never vomits at home.
they used this in the movie cause the lady who was the wife was in a commercial for Yuban coffee and she said that line in the commercial
I will, but Jim won't
Her name is Lee Bryant...   She played the pregnant lady, Punkin in an episode of three's company when Jack and Chrissy agree to take over Janet's babysitting job for one night and had to put up  with a crying baby, no TV, and a locked liquor cabinet  :)
If you are putting polygons together at a vertex, if the polygons are in the same plane, you know you have reached the max. In the case of hexagons, its 3. If you want to form a 3d shape, you need to use fewer, which would be 2, which also doesnt work because then the ball would just be 2 hexagons stacked on top of each other which would be hilarious to watch but nobody would score. I dont know if that's any simpler but thats how I thought about it
Matt Parker: Fighting the good fight.
I find this vídeo funny but is True.
no extra cost?  no such thing.  someone has to draw it up, the image must be then turned into whatever template that is used for the stencilling, lists updated with new image, etc, etc...  it would cost many many thousands to get it done properly.
Wooow great video and amazing editing!!!! I agree on the fact that's kinda an embarrassment for UK since you invented football and you had such a glorious tradition of mathematicians!
The skid warning signs annoys me more, the skid tracks cross each other!
While we are at it, that plane doesn't seem to have any engines.
What a Parker Square of a sign. They should update it ASAP.
I was told recently that the official standard for baseball's home plate is also a mathematically impossible shape. Is there something larger at play here with sports and maths? Conspiracy or not, I bet there's a joke or two in there...Look into it for us Matt.
Oh yeah- that'd be a good use of my road tax money, do that.......
Years from now, no one will remember what a hexagon is. But you win State, and that goes up on the water tower. - Hank Hill \n\nhttp://geocitiessites.com/arlen_texas/leagues.htm
Just checked, The Netherlands do have the correct geometry. Also just wanted to point out that the painted bicycles on the road surfaces are also wildly anatomically incorrect in the UK. Also worthy of a petition.
Matt, you are playing the Reading hexagon tonight, will that be a problem??
5:14 British? What about the Northern Irish people? I demand this be altered! I will have a petition up later if Matt doesnt respond!
I can't wait for the outcome of this petition! Lulz!
UK government, such a parker square....
How about this skidding car as another topologically incorrect uk sign? \nhttp://c8.alamy.com/comp/EHC763/new-road-layout-ahead-and-risk-of-skidding-road-signs-uk-EHC763.jpg
But what if on the back side of the ball you have triangles?
Matt, thanks. I always love your videos. I'm not a UK citizen but would otherwise sign your petition. I realize that this video focused on your petition, but I'm a bit surprised that you didn't cover two obviously relevant digressions. The specific digressions that come to mind are:\n\nA) That the pattern currently depicted is a hexagonal latice which has a planar topology, like the street sign.\n\nB) That only a projection of a 3D shape (like a polyhedron can be depicted on a planar street sign, and what projection you propose the new signs using, (isometric, I presume?) Also might want to touch on the foreshortening around the edges on the projected polyhedron?\n\nC) The fact that, the inflated ball isn't truly a polyhedron, as the edges are arcs, not lines, and the faces aren't planar.\n\nD) History, repercussions and examples of Euler characteristics.
What a Parker Sign.
People think maths isn't cool, and after watching you, I think they may be on to something.
Well, there is a reason why it has dark hexagons: It is displayed on a plane. For simplification reasons, they did not use a fake 3D image because this hexagonal picture scales better and is easier to reproduce (scaling for all this folks that doubt it, the lines towards the outside will get blurred if scaled down with pentagonal structures).
Ugh... This comment section has wonderfully illuminated the lacking sense of humour among the british public. Brilliant video Matt, don't let the not on my taxes lot get you down, they clearly weren't listening or comprehending.
Waste of time and expense, I hope this comes to nothing.
Wow I never noticed that. Can anyone tell me if it is the same in the US?
So... it's a Parker football?
A) Hexagens?  Pentagens?\n2) The images of the castle and fish and elephant are not realistic either.
One day this man will run for a President!
You should talk to a designer about what that would look like.\n\nAlso, none of those really look like the thing they represent except in an abstract sense.  For one thing, things rarely have holes that go all the way though, at least not ones you can see though.
On the sign, you can only see one side of the ball. Obviously, the other side contains different shapes which make it round like a football.
the current symbol really is a parker ball i must say
Can I just say that the elephant sign is used even if no elephants are actually present at the wildlife park indicated. That's what I call misleading.
I couldn't care less about football but now you have pointed this error out I won't be able to stop noticing it until it is fixed.
Just signed. There are now 17,462 signatures. Enough for his letter, but keep going and we might actually get someone to really do something about it.
Perhaps they should replace it with a prolate spheroid. Wouldn't that be better?
On the bright side, at least your government didn't want to make pi, or the equivalent of 0.5 * tau, equal to 3.2
BASTARDS!  Seriously, this is like the stock teamwork photo of three gears which contact each other such that they cannot function as gears. How can a country with such commitment to football/soccer get this so wrong? I blame it on the metric system.\n\n\nAlso - you need to find someone to produce a PDF version of the desired replacement to prevent an even worse version and to eliminate the 'what would it look like' stuck in committee problem. In fact, do one the way you want and also one that is obviously not-right in an aesthetic way to give the illusion of choice. People like picking the 'good one' and not having a preferred answer shoved on them.
It's a bit brave to link Bristol FC with football, isn't it? Are you sure the sign represents a football?
I just feel sorry for all those motorists trying to figure out which lane to drive into seeing a sign with changing equations for geometry
Is there any kind of non-Euclidean geometry where an all-hexagon ball does exist?
Suggestion: Provide an alternate design. People are much more willing to approve a change to correct something if they don't have to do what they perceive to be the hard part.
Dammit I'm italian, I can't sign it
The number of sides on a pentagon is a prime issue... oh har har 5 is prime...
We'e living in a time of austerity though. The government spent £39m on legal fees to try to strip people of their rightful disability benefits, do you really think they'll waste money on something like this.... actually, something this pointless and petty does sound like exactly the kind of thing May and Hammond think matters
I *HATE* football, but I *HATE* mathematical/geometric errors more, so I have signed the petition.
That doesn't look *much* like a castle. The crossed arrow slit is either extremely rare or non existent.\n\nThe problem is that the surface the sign is on is flat, not a sphere. Therefore you can't cover it with a pentagon+hexagon coverage. I don't think the filmed actual football looks as football-like as the one on the sign.
This is why petitions are jokes.
Haha... although mathematically you are correct they still wouldn't match reality if they changed the pic. Nobody plays with that style of ball anymore anyway. The original one was called the Adidas Telstar introduced in 1970. The classic black and white ball. Used again in World Cup 1974 until being superceded by the Adidas Tango in '78. Originally the Telstar was introduced to help people see the ball more easily on black and white TVs.
Well since the regs have literally just gone through an overhaul I’d say it’s a nice idea but never gonna happen :p
I have signed many of those such petitions, but this is completely different from any petition I have seen on there before!
Can we just ban football altogether?
Without context I'm not sure I could've figured out what pentagins are.
This shows that brits knows as little about ⚽️ as them stupid Americans that calls 🏈 an football.
The ball on the signs does not look quite right. It seems unnatural.  Thanks for explaining the mathematical reason why,
I am in the US but glad to see you making a difference in society and mathematics
I almost spit out my coffee at 3:21.
the government [...] don't really care about mathematics and science.\nOOH, D'YA THINK?!
He says all other signs make sense, but the wheelchair one you can see when he is saying that doesn't contain a full wheel.
Isn't a parliamentary petition overkill? Surely you just need to get a memo to the right department...
In my opinion this is a real problem worth fighting for #footbolsignmatters
Concerning your claim that no such ball can be made of (possibly distorted) hexagons: While the mathematics is surely correct, this does not exclude the possibility that some other shapes (say, pentagons) were used at the *back side* of the ball (that is not pictured on the road sign). This probably makes a less symmetrical soccer balls - but if we allow strangely distorted hexagons for the faces of the soccer ball, why not also allow to use differently shaped faces at the backside of the soccer ball (that one cannot see on the sign)?
Tank training ground is a Cromwell on signs.
Matt, I am sure you can come up with an imperfect approximation to a ball made all with hexagons and we'll call it The Parker Ball.
Perhaps the street signs are incorrect in _Euclidean_ geometry, but here in the real world we use _Minkowski_ geometry. Can you make a sphere out of hexagons in Minkowski space?
That was an interesting video!  At first, I thought, Who cares?  But, then when I thought about it and how you only wanted the newly made signs updated, I realized it does matter enough to correctly display football images on newly made signs.  Way to go, I hope you get your petition positively recognized.  I cannot sign anything since the only part of me that is UK is long past ancestry.
Petition to make him pronounce hexagon correctly
It's a Parker soccer ball, it's valid in Parker geometrical spaces
Undoubtedly a serious problem. Now all we have to fix is all those arrows pointing to the sky. Am sick of getting misdirected into space. It really messes up my day.
Just did it don't even like football but if its 3D will look 10 times better
Am I crazy or does he have an australian accent?
It's worth noting that the icosahedron was used in the Fat Man atomic bomb. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_icosahedron#Applications\nIt seems the ball is changing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(association_football)#FIFA_World_Cup\nMatt is right on this one. The representation on the sign is obviously incorrect, and lots of math-inclined people would notice.
*What is the music that you use at the end of this video?*
I don't see any footballs, hexagins, or pentagins - only soccer balls, hexagons, and pentagons.
Will there be a petition to change the airplane icon too? A plane wont fly without engines.

A ball made entirely of hexagons is known as a Parker Ball
Why not just get rid of all footyball nonsense in public entirely? It is a paupers game.
The zoo sign is also wrong!  Elephants' trunks always curl in, not out!
and where is the mathematics of a real football?\nhow many possible shapes can you combine to make a succesful football?
This is like saying the size and proportion of a castle sign is wrong we mist change it
We did it R̶e̶d̶d̶i̶t̶ YouTube!
Speaking as an American, I envy you that this is the worst of your mathematical problems.  8)
You've got too much time on your hands!
Alright then, The sign for roadworks needs changing because not all road workers are Black.
I totally agree! In norway, feminists got through to change all the old pedestrian crossing signs to a unisex silhouette of a person crossing, than the old man with a hat-silhouette. This cost Norway about 80m NOK, which is a bit less than 8m GBP. Crazy!\nI do agree that it was poorly designed, back in the 70's, but lets update the symbol, so all new signs get updated, and use those 80m NOK a bit more sensible.
HexagOn, pentagOn, gOn, GON!! O!!!'
Y R amazig!!
sounds like helen czerski and raindrop signs
this man is awesome
Parker square ball
17,418 when I signed :)
Wow, those are truly parker-football signs
nice chalkboard
Wtf have I just watched
Icons aren't meant to be real, they are meant to be easy to see and quickly to be recognisable. – Signs don't use photorealistic iconography of other things like cars, lorries, trees, because that would make it not stand out. – Would a pentagon-hexagon ball be easier to see then a solely hexagon ball?
I think you've missed the point of asking why the football has hexagons rather than pentagons.  As you say in the video, hexagons tessellate on a flat surface, and it is this flat surface that the designer is trying to achieve.  All of the roadsign designs feature a flattened, simplified perspective.  By these rules of perspective, a sphere must be replaced by a flat disk, and so the mixture of hexagons and pentagons must be replaced with a hex grid.\n\nI would have preferred regular hexes, though.
Who cares, it's a small meaningless change... also will the government listen to a petition and then waste money on useless sign changes
Yah, but then you can round the hexigon, gcd lcm, so 6 into 5, 30.  You cant easily use 15 without a cooly ball.  But why not?  In 1995, they had advanced materials, whirly tennis balls, you could play tennis in the rain.  It was so bouncy and aerodynamic that you could dip legendary shots, in the rain.  Man that was cool because any old man with wilson whites wasnt anywhere, just your marine core tennis pals. LOL! The ball was fusia, neon, and indigo ripple like a racquet ball, but hat slight overweight and under pressure with poly fillament that grabbed the air, discontinued in 2001 due to cannibals?  I was mad one time, and i realized baseball,  Take a ball because my bat blows smoke?  Upper cut a top spin into the short stop hitting the grass square negative curl for a frack your mom douglas serve koopa troopa.  So it stands to reason that whirly cleats with ankle 400 lbs skocks an d carbide teath are so supperior that nobody could beat and defeat them.  So we learned in 1993 how to compound with a caroitoid lever for acceleration.
You need to do something about these ones as well!  https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/55b76bec40f0b6790f000019/warning-sign-slippery-road.jpg
I have PCOS and I still struggle with body image because of the side effects of it so I really appreciated seeing Leena's attitude and it was really inspiring and I don't know it just made me feel better so <3.
Insulin allows cells to take in glucose, which is used as fuel and allows the cell to function properly. So actually, when your body becomes resistant to insulin (meaning that the cells wont recognize it, and therefore they wont take in the glucose), it produces more insulin to try solve the problem. And this leads to diabetes.\n\nAlso all women have follicles where the eggs grow. Normally, an egg is released from its follicle every month (ovulation). However, in women with PCOS, if the follicle fails to open and release the egg, the fluid remains inside the follicle and forms a functional cyst (which is different from cancerous - is that the word in english? - cysts)
Right, I just thought this was cute: My four-year-old daughter watched the tail end of this and said that you two have the same voice. It took me a bit, but then I realized she meant your accents. Love this series Hannah! Thanks for the awesome info and coverage.
Hannah's bf must be having his dreams fulfilled
I don't want to be that annoying person who gives unsolicited advice.. But you could read 'Woman Code' by Alisa Vitty, she diagnosed and healed her PCOS maybe that is usefull for you! ☺️
i was diagnosed about 4 years ago and my doctor explained it to me like the NHS explains it, and she did add a bit of history saying that some years ago doctors did though they were actual classical cysts. so thats probably why lena was so confused at the beggining. xx
Human DNA has been evolving to out a strand of genetics that has been dominant in history that is the underwritten Alzheimer's gene and people under 25 have evolved just enough through Selective Breeding to remain free of the Alzheimer's gene or DNA strand, people over 24 report losing memories at age 27 and then they begin committing crimes as well as making headway in developing criminal syndicates that work with the government and they start families and become heterosexuals
I'm currently being tested for PCOS. I'm 27 and it's taken 10 years to get to this stage, my extremely irregular and very painful periods were always blamed on being overweight. I had a scan and apparently don't have anything on/in my ovaries leading my GP to tell me I don't have it. However another GP at my practice told me  I have all the other symptoms and the cysts are just one symptom. I finally have an appointment at the hospital with a specialist in November. Doctors drag things out and Ness you around so much. If you're even a little overweight that's all the doctors see at first, I've suffered for over a decade because the doctors didn't test me for anything. In fact this time I was told that apparently I had a blood test 10 years ago and the results were iffy but I was never told, it was never followed up and nothing happened about it. I'm just glad I've finally got some answers and can attempt to move forward with things.
I was told by an insensitive doctor when I was about 15 that I may have PCOS. I was a fairly late bloomer when it came to periods and they soon became irregular up to 6 months or so. I have a lot of dark hair which I assume was just hereditary and I always yo-yo'd with my weight. It was terrifying being told that I couldn't have kids but this doctor said you never know because the likes of Victoria beckenham suffer with it and look at her (the fuck?) I had no idea what it was and felt like my womanhood was taken away from me. I had scans which came back boarder line and now I'm 22 and still have no idea other than I *assume* I'm ok. I'm careful with what I eat (especially with IBS) my periods are regular from taking Yasmin years ago but the growth in facial hair is insane. I epilate / pluck after years of shaving (I know) and it's a constant struggle - my hormone tests showed nothing obvious but I definitely feel something isn't right. Waffling over :(
I also have PCOS and I am not on any contraception. I treat mine with metformin which is also used for diabetes and helps control my blood sugar.
This video is also really relatable, I have IBS, eczema and chronic back pain so I know what it's like to have a weird love-hate relationship with my body. It does amazing things for me but also fails at the most basic functions. It's been a journey.
Both of you ladies look GORGEOUS in this video! ❤️
I'm sure someone will have suggested this already but have you thought about doing something similar for endometriosis? The comments show how many people this video has helped and I know how much it would have meant to me as a teenager to have something like this for my condition. Anything to raise awareness of endo helps as many of the symptoms are dismissed as just bad periods and it can only by diagnosed via laparoscopy. As a result of this, diagnosis takes on average 7 years and is a long and emotional process that no one should have to do on their own.
i have pcos, but i am not overweight or anything and i didn't feel any like 'bad symptoms' so far. But i went to the doctor lately and he basically told me: Your overies look bad, not sure you will be able to get pregnant, you have PCOS. Badabum. i was like: wow, wtf, thanks for your sensitivity... :(
was always playing the mum in theatre because I was chubbier - omg same
Oh my God I was 18 when I was diagnosed. Leena's story hit so close to home I wanted to cry a little. I'm so glad we aren't alone. Love it when the doctor's say just lose weight. Like we don't try. \n\nAlso totally had that moment with the childbearing. I had always assumed I would have kids my entire life; then at 18 when I was told by my doctor that I probably wouldn't be able to have kids, I had a 5-6 year span where I told myself I didn't want kids (I think because I assumed I couldn't have them). Now, only in the last year or so, have I started wanting kids again, I think because I'm in a relationship where I feel loved and supported no matter whether we have kids or not. It's very weird.
I have PCOS but was never told I had cysts. Just have irregular periods, high male hormones, extra body and facial hair etc., I don't get a lot of weight gain as I have an eating disorder but that also contributes to irregular periods and body hair! No doctors can give me a definite answer which is annoying so I don't really know what's happening
I had the irregular periods, painful, bad acne and weight gain but the mood swings/ bad depression was worst part for me. Pill helps but also causes symptoms of anxiety and depression?!
perfect timing for this video, just found out I might have PCOS
The NHS basically only recognises the diagnosis of PCOS as a woman who has excess hair growth, high testosterone, is overweight etc. HOWEVER- PCOS can also be associated with other hormonal issues that basically just aren't recognised by the NHS. A relative of mine has been diagnosed with PCOS and I haven't yet but experience many of the same symptoms as she did before treatment. Neither my relative nor I experience any of the traditional PCOS symptoms: we are both slim, little body hair etc. with low oestrogen but not high testosterone. The low oestrogen wreaks havoc on my urinary tract because it changes the PH balance of the area causing it to be more alkali and less acidic (should be slightly acidic) as well as a myriad of other contributing problems such as less natural good bacteria etc. This causes me to get UTIs very frequently with no cause and other bladder related pain and issues. This can be extremely painful day to day and incredibly debilitating. My relative was the same and also had other symptoms, however in order to be diagnosed she had to see a private doctor, since no nhs doctor would test her or take her seriously. They even told her it was all in her head and she was just making it up, and I've had similar experiences with nhs doctors. They simply don't recognise other forms of hormonal problems in women and its really awful and upsetting when you are essentially living with chronic pain, to not be taken seriously by doctors whose job it is to help you with your health. When my relative was tested- lo and behold, clear markers of hormonal problems, but NHS doctors hadn't even bothered to look. Luckily with support from family she could afford to pay for a private doctor or else she may have had to live with pain and may not have even been able to have children. I believe this lack of understanding of the female hormonal system is largely due to sexism in the NHS and just a lack of care and concern for women's health. It is truly despicable the amount of pain the numerous NHS doctors have caused my relative, and my own experience tells me this is not merely a few rogue doctors- It is simply policy to ignore women in pain.
I remember before i got diagnosed with PCOS and i had to have an ultrasound on my ovaries but there was never anything on them and i went a few times , so once i finally had my glucose checked did i find out i have it
I think this was super informative and really interesting. I have CFS (google it) and because its so untreatable and unknown, every single time i learn about some new illness/disease, im like oh i could have that!! It would explain this and this and this! I switch into hypochondriac mode, but only because im always desperately searching for an explanation as to WHY im like this :/
this video is awesome! i have pcos and went through so many of the same experiences (diagnosed at 15, put on the pill, attempts to remove hair and lose weight and such) and it's great that you are talking so openly about just accepting your body the way it is. <3
Having PCOS,  for me it's about not letting it define me. In the back of my head I know weightloss can be harder, but I persist anyway. The youtuber Sarahs Day is a good inspiration for me because she's fit, healthy and happy and doesn't let her hormones rule her, and shows how she balances her body out.\n\nMine developed later in life and I just saw it as life steering me in a healthy direction. So I told myself I couldn't be like all the young people surrounding me - to stop with regular drinking and careless eating. Now I stick to yoga and whole foods. It's probably saved me from more serious things in the future that develop due to poor lifestyle choices.
Thank you for this! I was diagnosed with pcos a few months ago at the age of 25. I was completely terrified and relieved at the same time. I went undiagnosed for almost 10 years in those 10 years I would only get my period if I was on birth control. If I was not on the pills I would just not get a period. I knew absolutely nothing about pcos a few months ago. Seeing this now makes me more secure about having pcos and hearing more stories is amazing!
I have PCOS. Got diagnosed this year (I'm 25) and now I just got a letter in the mail about how I should get a flu shot because I'm in some risk group and Im like what risk group... the diabetes one or? I guess the diabetes one. \nAnyways. I got diagnosed because once I got off the pill (because I forgot to take it and was just waiting for my period to start again) that I was only on because of my hairy problems.. and then I didn't get my period for 2 years. Went to the doctor after 3 or 6 months or whatever and she was like come back in x months. So I came back and they were like you might have pcos let's test it. And I read about it and I was like oh I for sure have that I have all the symptoms. But I didn't get proper diagnosed till this year because my gynacologist and doctor couldn't agree on how to test me at the time but then this year I went back and they were like oh no we don't need that you already meet the criteria just because you have the hair and the acne and the irregular periods. I'm like great well they could've told me that 3 years ago. But I think the criteria changed as well. Anyways. I'm trying this dairy-free, gluten-free, soy -free, low glycemic load diet but it is hard because I hate cooking and i'm in Hungary and I don't speak the language so how am I going to find all the things I need or how do I know if I can even have something lol. I tried laser for the hair on my face, it didn't work, only made it worse. Mentally it sucks because I just feel worthless like not only am I overweight, I also have too much hair everywhere and the acne doesn't help either. Kids I am not too concerned about I don't really want them.
(Not PCOS, but other medical complications)\nUgh yes when doctors are like WHEN you decide you want to get pregnant... , like I have told you ten times I don't, if I decide otherwise I will tell you.
Im very very happy to see this video! I too have PCOS. Was diagnosed as pre diabetic at 13 but wasnt diagnosed with PCOS until 22. Tall about a struggle!
Maybe do a video on Endometriosis as well? Because it's so common and affects a lot of people. It's also a reason a lot of women are on the pill. I don't even have a diagnosis but my symptoms were really strong, so, as Leena, I was put on the pill long before being sexually active. I think it's important to talk about these kind of issues cause as you said in one of your previous videos, there's some kind of movement against hormones, but people forget hormones do a lot of other stuff on top of the birth control part. And I feel it's quite disturbing when people just assume I'm some kind of sex addict or whatever when they find out I'm on the pill, even if it's just medicine for me.
I had a lot of the symptoms of PCOS but the ultrasound only showed a small sac on one of my ovaries so they came to the conclusion that i dont have it, finding that out was hard because i thought i had finally found an explanation for my symptoms when i hadnt
I really like this series. I have learnt a lot of things from this I didn't know in depth about. Especially today's episode has made me think to go and be checked myself as I have had a few symptoms of this. Xx
ye i have some of these symptoms but idk if i should go get checked or not?
I have it and live in and the US, I lost both of my ovaries to tumors and that's how I found out I even had it! Fun fact losing ovaries does not end the condition. Loved this video I have had such a hard time finding real information that wasn't geared towards women who are worried about getting pregnant which when I search for info all I get is fertility information which makes me feel doubly awful because I obv can't get pregnant so I do not care and it makes me feel like my only function in life was to be a baby factory. It's just so frustrating sorry to vent!
I love love that PCOS is being talked about more, like so many people I was diagnosed when I was 15 when nobody really knew much about it and talking about it was taboo but videos like this mean we can all learn more about our bodies and feel ok talking about this shitty syndrome ❤️
Thank you so much for this!!! Such a lovely surprise in my subscription feed xx Love both your videos!
I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 14 (I'm now 23). I was put on the pill (Dianette) too.  I have excess hair and weight gain but didn't know about the other things (insulin etc). Good old NHS choices. This video was reassuring! Thanks for talking it.
People still listen to Good Charlotte?
Did they give you something like glucophage when you were first diagnosed?
I have PCOS and I was nodding my head all through out while Hannah's reading the symptoms and description of PCOS 😂 I was like yup.. ahuh.. true, true.. 😂😂😂
I feel so deeply for little Lena and her male doctor experience. I also have PCOS that was diagnosed at 15 and I had a TERRIBLE male doctor that told me I was fat and if I didn't lose weight to where he thought I should be that he would fire me as a patient. This is the same male doctor that told me (at a later date) that I would just never be able to have kids. I eventually switched to a new doctor that was completely horrified by his behavior.
I relate so much to not knowing that much about your illness! I have Crohns and I'm only slowly learning what it is and getting better at answering people when they wonder what it is. It's weird when people ask you about your illness and you can't really answer, but I'm not interested enough to go read about it haha..
Thank you so much for doing this video!! I have PCOS, and I'm also resistant to insulin, but I had no idea they were connected! I just thought I had made some really bad nutritional decisions as a kid and didn't remember or something. But hey I suppose it's always good to check up on what you thought you knew every now and again lol.\nAnd yeah the symptoms are shit. It would usually mean I missed a few days of school every couple months or so when periods DID happen. Now I have a hormonal IUD (Mirena) and it's actually been helpful so far? The pill I took in high school was shit, so I'm really surprised this is working out so well!\nAlso of I remember correctly, I think depression and vitamin D shortage are also correlated with PCOS? It's ridiculous how much of the body is interconnected.
Oh, just for the confusion, the 'cysts' are actually vacuums. Basically, the egg is produced within the ovary, but people with PCOS don't release a hormone that allows it to follow through to the fallopian tube, so it becomes a vacuum instead. These vacuums can build up and replace important tissue, making people with PCOS infertile, so that's why it's so important to see what your options are!
I haven’t been diagnosed with PCOS but I was put on the pill to get rid of ovarian cysts. I also had really bad pain while on my period and it was very irregular. The pill actually helped a lot with both 👍
Hannah, it would be lovely if one of these videos was about retroverted uterus. I have it - It shouldn't be a problem in having babies or anything like that. It's just your uterus being in a different position than it should be. It caused me a lot of pain - during sex, during using tampons. It's because these things are touching my uterus. Now, I'm trying to use the menstrual cup. It doesn't cause any pain, but i've tried several different cups and they still keep leaking, even after a year I've been using them. They told me it's got a thing to do with me being a different shape down there. \n\nI didn't know about it for quite a time when i was younger and i kept wondering why certain positions hurt sooo much.\nIt would be lovely, if there are more young ladies, who maybe haven't been to gynecologist yet, to know about this.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!! I was diagnosed with PCOS 4 years ago and struggle to find people talking about it. \nI'd like to share that I feel like my doctor told me nothing, most of what I know is from my own research which is very annoying when you find conflicting information online. \nIt's not something that really effects me, I have all the symptoms but I've learnt to live with them. However, when trying to lose weight is when I notice it most. People around me seem to drop 2kg in a week where as it will take me a whole month to lose that much, its so disheartening and my mental health suffered because of this. I saying this so others don't feel alone and also if anyone has any tips please please please hit me up! ❤️
Thank you for making this video! I was diagnosed last year at 20 years old. I didn't get my period until I was nearly 17 and they've always been very irregular, but I was missing other common symptoms like insulin resistance, high androgen levels, and being overweight, so none of my doctors checked until I was 20. They did change the definition of PCOS recently (not sure how recently), so now you only have to meet 3 'criteria' to be diagnosed (acne, irregular periods, and ovarian cysts were mine).
I always thought the fluid filled bags were what cysts are 😌
I have PCOS. It took me years to find out what was wrong and even after that managing it has not been fun, especially as all doctors see is my weight. When I was 15/16, I went to a doctor complaining of stomach pain (most likely my uterus but I was still learning about my body) and irregular periods that were heavy and leave me unable to function. Doctor looked at me, pointed out my weight gain near my middle, acknowledged my irregular periods, commented on my excessive hair and noted my high insulin levels. All of these are key symptoms of PCOS. Instead he told me to loose weight and gave me some samples for my stomach pain. So I left there, changed my diet and still a year later nothing had changed. I gave up. Till I turned 21, when I complained about the same thing and was finally diagnosed. Problem is I went on the pill and my reaction was really bad bleeding and resulted in anaemia and A hospital visit. 4 years since then and I haven't got it sorted or anything. I've also added the lovely issues of depression and anxiety, two common mental health conditions that PCOS women are more inclined to have. So I've had PCOS playing with me for a decade now (possibly even when I was 12, but that may just be growing up fun) and it's still changing and challenging me. \n\nDespite all this I'm learning, and with each year I learn more about this condition and how I can cope with it. So to any one suffering from PCOS or any symptoms that they feel is real and more then just a weight or age thing, seek out alternative advice if you can, until YOU feel better about yourself and are satisfied. And be willing to learn along the way. Good luck~!
Thank you for making this video. After being given conflicting messages following my diagnosis it is hard to know how to manage it. Especially when you’re told just to lose weight when its easier said than done.
Where did u get your shirt from ?
OK. wow. Leena is so right? I have a primary ovial insuffience (no idea if thats the name, im german so thats the literal translation) and been diagnosed when I was 15, because I hadnt gotten my period then. And untill today (age 20) i have never even googled it because fuck im afraid. It means I dont get my period naturally (Im on the pill now, so now I do) and I 95% wont be getting pregnant ever. And that shit is scary. But what I want to say: thanks for making this. Just having someone talk openly about conditions /illneses that are just in the slightes way like mine makes not feeling shit so much easier.
This was actually pretty interesting. Thank you for putting in effort to educate us viewers. Especially young viewers like myself (14 yrs,) it’s super important.
My nan had PCOS and so even though I dont have any symptoms I always worry I won't be able to have kids as I've always wanted to. Probably no need to worry though but yeah
So relatable... I don't have PCOS but I had ovarian cancer at an usually young age (14)... With only one ovary left I've battled huge hormanal changes, lots of different pills and lots of (male) doctors giving me their own opinions on what I should do with my body. Frustratingly, my doctor refused to put me on a pill after my operation, as he thought 14/15 was too young to be on it so I essentially had period for about 2 years straight with IMMENSE PAIN. After lots of trials on finding a pill that actually regulated me I was put on Diane35 - which is the same as Dianette I think - which as far as I know is used for acne, but is banned in some countries, causes blood clots and has a huge link to depression. And I've been on that for years. Yet no matter what, doctors can't really tell me what the effect of any of this has? I've been told that my 'time limit' for babies is shorter so I better be a mum quicker (ew), yet no one has answers for the long term effect of a heavy pill, or why my period was irregular after my operation, or why I suddenly had immense period pain (that still continues with the pill, and hurts despite taking opiates?). PERIODS ARE FRUSTRATING ): \nBut this series is great, thank you Hannah for continuing to care about women's bodies and inform the world xx
I have been diagnosed when I was 13 and had multiple doctors since then. I have always had a problem with my weight even though I was in semi professional dancing group and at the same time in aerobic team at my uni. I want to share two thoughts that might help smb:\n1. It's common to have too much insulin as it is not efficient and this excess it the reason for extra weight. As insulin makes you put on weight, you produce even more of it. Last year I started taking Glucophage and it helps a lot. I lost nearly 10% of my body mass, by just taking it (no changes in exercise and diet), also I am less hungry, more energised and productive, so totally recommend talking about it with your doctor.\n2. My  other doctor suggested that it is easier to get pregnent after withdrawal of the pill as your period is regulated. I haven't tried jest though, so cannot say from experience :p
I got diagnosed with PCOS just last summer. \nI had come off the pill in october because I wanted to see if that would help my mental health since I'm  person who is very susceptible to depression and such. I then had a very long period for all of november and then it just stopped in december. I didn't have any periods at all and I only thought to tell my mum when it was almost summer again. Coming off the pill was absolutely horrible for me. I felt my mental health destabilize even more, I gained weight despite making an effort to do some exercise, I grew more bodyhair which was also quite dark and thick. \nSo eventually, I went to see a doctor. First one I had basically did the same as told here 'oh you're fat so you need to lose weight and it'll go away'. She didn't explain what was happening very well either. I was just so confused. That was my first time ever seeing a gyno and I'm glad my mum was with me because she pushed for the doctor to give me something to help me along. I'm an overweight person, but not overly so. And my mum knew that, and she knew I was trying to lose weight before but that it wasn't working. So, they gave me an extra heavy pill and I was on that for a few months. Until I went for my follow up exam with another doctor.\nHe seemed a little cross when I explained what happened last time and basically I went in there and he explained properly what was going on in my uterus and such and then said I don't HAVE to be on that heavy pill, I can just take the regular one I was taking when I first started taking the pill. \n\nEver since then, I've been feeling quite alright. My body has gone down in terms of swelling, which was the main thing for me. I couldn't stand it because I knew something wasn't quite alright with that. My mental health is in quite good shape which is making life a lot easier. It's been good since that last visit.\n\nIt does scare me a little tho, that you say you're pre-diabetic. That's something my doctor did not explain to me. My mum has diabetes so I'm already at a higher risk for it. I do get check ups every four years for a research they're doing around diabetes and how it affects offspring. So far, so good. But good to know that's a thing to look out for. She has type 1 so it's a lesser chance I'll get it too just because of genes, but there is still a risk.
As someone who has been diagnosed with PCOS since she was 13 I'm so happy that there is finally a video on it that says how while it is something that we have to live with, and while it does affect our lives, it doesn't really control us and we find our own ways of how to deal with it and still be cool as fuck human beings <3
As an older woman with both Pcos and Endometriosis i enjoyed  this video so much. I also do not want children, ( lucky really) ) The weight is a big issue for for me, even though  i am a size 10/12, i exercise  a lot and eat well. I have been having laser hair removal for the last year, although it does come at a price.... it is sooooo worth it!! I wish i has had it done years. ago.
I have this too!! I was diagnosed when I was twelve but not really officially, it was just suspicion with no follow up. When I was 17 I got checked again because my period is all over the fucking place, early this year.  It's so weird how there's no tablets or anything to help the release of eggs for people not wanting to get pregnant. No method to help me has been suggested so im assuming there is none?\n but that in itself really pisses me off 1)because there seems to be a trend in misinformation or lack of information and 2) because it communicates to me that there aren't any people researching what can help PCOS.\n I have my period with week - two week long gaps and i would like that to not be a thing and have made it clear in the first case that my period was a problem I would to sort out - yet all medical professionals seem to be doing with PCOS people is just remarking o thats funny, sending us to whatever external office to get tested, then just leaving us there to sit with with syndrome. This condition isn't horrible or urgent, but still is effecting me negatively. I mean have 2 events of 6-9 day  periods a month, more money spent of sanitary items and less time to be sexually active (my country isn't as accepting of period sex :( cry) leaving me and others pissed off and helpless. arehg;erwh yluhtgur.
Im really struggling with my pcos atm\nThank you for this
They often prescribe metformin to treat PCOS, which is originally for diabetes. It can help with the weight.
my best friend has PCOS and i love that more people are talking about it on youtube
I have many of the symptoms of PCOS, that is irregular periods, difficulty losing weight, insulin resistance, facial hair around my chin. Because of this I had the ultrasound to see, to which my doctor at the time said I didn't. When I went to a gynecologist for a second opinion he said that doctors are constantly arguing over what the definition of PCOS, and that they can never come to an agreement. For me, I get very frustrated, and sad and embarrassed because I don't have an answer on what is going on with my body. I don't feel like a girly girl and that bothers me and i often feel like I won't ever be able to find a guy who is going to understand this. It would just be nice to have an answer on what is going on with my body.
Needed this. I have it too and it's great to hear others about it. I don't have any symptoms except for having no period, so im kinda lucky.
Uhhhhmmm I'm freaking out a little bit because by watching this video, I'm pretty sure I have pcos... like literally everything she's said I've experienced, besides all of the pill/coil experiences.
I didn't know about PCOS until Lena posted her first video on it. Those symptoms she described were the ones I had! I went to my nurse practitioner and asked her about it. She put me on some form of the pill (don't remember which) in order to get my periods to a regular schedule. I took those for a year and it did not help my brain. I already have anxiety, and the pills pushed my anxiety to unhealthy levels. This last February, I got an IUD (Skyla, low hormones and made for uteruses who have not given birth). Since, my PCOS symptoms are slowing down, my mental health is better, and I've began to lose weight!
Your friend is so lovely and positive. It gives so much hope for her to say that she shaves w her bf and it's fine. Like, all of us hairy women out here being told we're not attractive bc of our facial hair can see that we can be loved. Thank you for this video
Wow! Facintating! Thank you for sharing all this good info on PCOS. I have it but not the symptoms other than shooting pain when ovulating. Wheee!
I was recently diagnosed with PCOS about 2 months ago. I'm still in denial about it, hoping that I can change it with diet, exercise and anything else I can try. I'm seeing a naturopath and after having my bloodwork done, he didn't see anything related to the typical hormones surrounding PCOS as being a cause for it. Instead, he saw that I had low vitamin D and iodine levels, which are things that contribute to hormone production and regulation. I've been taking vit D and seaweed (high in iodine) for the last few months, limiting soy products, and exercising more. I'll be getting my blood done in the next few weeks, anxious to see my new results!
I found out 12 years ago (when I was 16) that I had PCOS and I can definitely relate to Leena's entire experience because mine was so eerily  similar. I was told at 16 WHAT?! YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR PERIOD YET?! SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH YOU!  I was forced to go through many uncomfortable tests (including the ultrasound where I almost peed on myself too) only to have the doctor's say You have this condition. You might not be able to have children. You have extra testosterone so you will be fat, hairy and oh get used to that acne because it's here to stay. You are at risk for several health conditions including diabetes & cancer. You need to accept that now. Oh you want a treatment? have you tried losing weight even though I just told you that it will be almost impossible to do that. Oh and even though you've never even kissed a boy yet, here, start taking these birth control pills maybe they will help your hormones. Sorry Bye. It's a difficult thing to come to terms with as a 16 year old especially in the midst of severe mental health issues I was also dealing with at the time. I've learned to manage my condition (badly at times) over the years but it makes me feel so much better when people try to educate themselves about the condition like you have because it's not just something that takes a toll on your body but on your mind as well and having support around you in the form of family/friends can ease the heavy burden you carry around everyday when you are a PCOS sufferer. <3
I have PCOS. I only found out because I had my period three weeks on one week off for 4 months in a row, then found out I had high levels of testosterone. No cysts though. They gave me birth control and I haven't seen or heard from my period again, which I'm loving.
One of the scariest moments of my life was when my former roommate who has pcos had a large cyst burst. She started feeling the pain about 830p. It took until about 915p to talk her into going to the er. We were there until 5a the next morning. It released something into her system that almost killed her. Always take these issues seriously please!
I have PCOS and my doctor told me at 16 can't have children. I was half way through my second year at university I found out I was 9 months pregnant and didn't know I was actually pregnant but because of the doctors telling me I couldn't and having blood tests and appointment where no one picked it up, I had no idea. It really affected my mental health from not knowing and being told something by a doctor, so I can't trust them now. PCOS is something that's so difficult to manage. Thank you for sharing this video 💜
My mom has PCOS but will never really talk about it. I've learned so much, thank you!
THANK YOU FOR THIS 🙌 I was diagnosed with pcos about 6 years ago and nobody talks about it.
I don't have the Syndrome, but I do have Polycystic Ovaries, so the symptoms aren't as harsh with me. But it's really nice to see someone else's experience! I found out about mine because I had very severe acne and after an incredibly strong treatment that worked wonders, some of it came back way faster than it should've. So I had the same exam Leena had, which is an ultrasound with you on the verge of peeing and my treatment was (is) being on the pill. It did help a lot though because my periods were always sooo irregular and painful (so SO painful) and now I feel almost nothing and know exactly when it's gonna pop up, which is GREAT. So yeah, just thought I'd share my experience as well since someone might have more mild symptoms like I had.
I have PCOS. Thank you for bringing awareness. ❤️
Hannah and Leena, you both make such informative and insightful videos. Thanks for putting this out into the world!
I went off the pill at the start of the year and have followed along with this series ever since. My doctor has suggested I get tested for PCOS as she have some of the symptoms.
Doctors are supposed to give accurate, reliable and current information. \nSo many don't do it though.
Hiya Hannah :), \nIm really loving the hormone diaries i find it interesting that hormones effect everyone in so many different ways!!,  I was wondering if you could make an episode on Turner syndrome i would really love you to make a video on the topic as its pretty rair for people to know of it :), its a condition effecting women in which i have . One symptom is lack of fertility, i have underactive ovaries which means im on HRT to get periods , i may need an egg donar when i decide to have children i dont mind as i will ask my big sister and  where i have a womb i will hopefully be able to carry my baby full term which i think i will be a really cool thing to share with my sister 😊💖🌼, sending  hugs hannah :) http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Turners-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx
Great video for raising awareness xx
i was diagnosed with PCOS a few months ago and it's been such a positive ride since! so glad i finally got over the anxiety of the doctor and found out for sure i have it
OMG! This is sooo useful! I think I might have to go to the doctor.
This is a great video
I was diagnosed 2 yrs ago and I have always thought it was cysts on my ovaries
when you have a bottle collection with the same bottles.... <3
This was a really good interview. Hannah, I think this is a particular skill of yours - you're great at getting to the heart of the matter, past the surface and asking really insightful questions. Thank you Leena for opening up about it. There should be no shame! xx
as someone with PCOS, it's honestly really great to hear someone with a similar experience talk about it and being able to relate. Thank you for making such an amazing video :)
An episode on endometriosis would be really helpful. I was recently diagnosed 3 months ago, 8 years after i started suffering at age 15. I think its so important that people are aware of this condition and the impact it can have on peoples lives!
Is PCOS ever considered an intersex condition?
U are awesome
dis a good comment section. thanks fur geetin' peeps talkin'.
So interesting 💜💜
I thought it was Polycystic *Ovarian* Syndrome.
7:45 aww also Shrek reference <3
Leena, my love!!!
just diagnosed!
You DO get cysts on your ovaries when you have PCOS! The cyst forms when the follicle tries to release the egg and it cant so the follicle swells and turns into a cyst on your ovary where the egg should have been released.
Aww, Dogman is the sweetest! Treasure him , Bunny, he's a real catch! :)

I LOVE me some Bunny and Dogman.  They are so fantastic together!  I love how well they compliment one another!!   I need to move to the big TX so I can become their neighbor!!!
Oh my god dog man that was so sweet of you to pick all of those outfits out and then the bag 😢 omg I shed a tear that was so cute.
I ACTUALLY LOVE YOU TWO TOGETHER ALWAYS HAVE ALWAYS WILL, MY LORD AND QUEEN
Bunny you and Dogman are so cute and sweet together! What a lucky couple!
How much legal marijuana did you smoke for this vid?  Not even judging just get that vibe
Purple, seriously.
Scoops! 👏👏👏
Gotta catch 'em all cats. Lol
The glasses are purple on camera
do a couple clothing lookbook/challenge kind of deal now that you 2 have the same pants! get all matchy matchy
Glasses are purple! At least on camera. And yeah, a lot of youtubers do not wear pants.................. :D On that notice, I think my favorite old man is Henry Rollins xD Bruce Willis is getting old too...hmmm
Bunny you should do the girlfriend buys my outfit tag! Lol 👏👏🐰🐇
The new version of the dress: are those glasses purple or blue???
They r so cute
If you wore pants you would get used to it. And it wouldn't bother you..
THE HEAD KISS! Oh my gosh. He has so much patience and love towards her and it’s seriously so respectful and amazing.
WHERE DID YOU GET THOSE JEANS WITH THE HOLES IN THE BUTT,,,, I AM DESPERATE
Omg I want these so much!!!
am I the only one that noticed when she's showing the boots she's basically naked in the mirror lmao
i just came across your channel and your personality is fun☺️💞 but i just kept finding myself back away from my phone cuz u just seem tooo close upppp...like your face& lashes are screaming at me...make sense? yes😳😳😬😜
I’m a muffin angel pie
Those boots are so gorgeous ! And you are so beautiful 😍
hi amber i love you videos. you always make me happy. i love your channel because you have such a out of the box style ,but i love it! and trust me i'm broke to girl. thank you amber and keep being you!!!!!!!!
Omg girl you went from cold to in a bikini 😂 I love yooou
It's funny. because Riri spent $10,000 on hers and you spent $100. and it looks like the same damn thing but only yours just look better lol ... don't get me wrong Riri is pretty but just because she got money don't mean she's the beautifulest  woman in the world. but what you got on look like the same thing she got on it's basically the same thing but only they put hers on the higher cost which should not even be that much in reality .... and you pulled that look off just like she pulled that look off ....😂😂😊
good job got to make one
She's what I'd expect snow white to sound like but without the bland personality.
Honestly your shoes looks much better than Riri's, I would buy your DIY... Gorgeous QUEEN
Can you have video making of selena Gomez pleeeaaaase
LMAO What in the heck is up with asking?? how much coffee did she drink? Amber didn't drink no damn coffee she's just a fun person that is not boring she's always excited and thats a good thing (Coffee is a Shitty hot drink) that has caffeine in it that keeps you wide awake and you can die from it because you drinking too much it's not Soda or Pepsi caffeine is like a drug in your drink you drink that all the time you'll never get any sleep you'll be high as a kite and you'll start to have body failure meaning your body will start shaking on its own people it's not a joke thing with Coffee=caffeine your killing your self slowly.
Please please please don't change
How is your teeth so white?? I need to know! LOL
OMGGGGGG I love the Red💄💄💄💄you look so beautiful😍😍\nI can't wait to have enough money to go to California so I can go to all the stores you go to for your DIY's😇😇I have faith I'll make it to Cali and when I do (in my head) we will shop for only the best sales and 💍💎💎💎😂😂

It's so cute how she is still saying broke bitch even though she is at 1mil
Hey Amber u like gloves too?? I love ur outfits and shoes 😍😍😍😍😍
I just want start by saying thank you Amber ❤️ Because of you I finally got the courage to start my very own YouTube channel! Honestly if it wasn’t for me coming across your channel and spending hours watching your videos, I don’t think I would’ve ever started my channel (which was only about two weeks ago!!) You are just so genuine to your followers and I love you for that! 💕 So keep doing you boo and keep up the amazing work! 💋
Why does she have eyebrows on her lash line?
You should do something with the lashes. They don't look that pretty
I could be Bill Gates rich, and still wouldn't spend 10K on some boots.  DIY boots looked good.
I thought you were pregnant I’m confused I just started watching you
I hit the like button because i love you. The boots could've came out a little better,,, but you are my favorite still.
Are you ready for carli's launch!! Her shinny booties were made for you !! 😍✨

I luv rihanna and amber at the same time and when I saw this video I clicked so fast the end tho
Amber any ideas on how to bling up some old Uggs?
Amber can you please make a video on how you fixed and made those shorts that was to small to  fit you :)
a website called fashion nova has some like rihannas for $150
Omg Amber you should start your own clothing line ❤
Lady you did a amazing job on these boots WOW 😳. Tfs
do swatches and tests of your mauve lip liner
I bought exact glue because of your videos and I found it to be the most horrible I’ve ever used😫 I don’t get it
I just found your channel, safe to say you're my favorite YouTuber now
I just love you 😩😩😩😩
YES girl! Love this. So sweet so cool
I wish she would make a collab with Shane dawson that would be awsome
We need a full story
I love your vids Amber and have been watching them for a long time but this wasn't your best tbh. Felt really rushed and the result wasn't that great. ;_; sorry
Regular Human : *Gets cold at home - put on  warm fuzzy robe* ; Fabulous Amber *Gets cold at home - puts on fabulous blue fur coat* 😍😍😍😍 I'm cry 😭😭😭
Amber, I had A HORRIBLE day today, I literally hit a few lows today, but I have to say your video was one of the few things to make me genuinely laugh and smile throughout the day. Thank you for being you <3 I hope we cross paths one day xx from NYC :)
you always have the best video ideas!!!
I wonder what Amber wore to prom and homecoming
The one you have look cute then riri's
Your thumbnail (on my iPad), your price is covered with the length time of the video
Amber. How. Do. You. Do. It!
I seriously think you can make  a successful comedy actress or an animation artist.lol
Please do the iconic Marilyn Monroe JFK dress.
Amber I wanna know where you got that black jacket😩
IM WATCHING THIS ON MY BIRTHDAY
Where is her black jacket from?
So we just going to ignore the fact that we can see amber only wearing a bra & underwear through the mirror @ the background when she was showing us how the boots came out 😂😂  5:00-5:08
Windsor (a clothing line online) has a pair of shoes that are literally the exact same shoes Rihanna is wearing. They are $145 but still they’re cute
I knew you're gonna DIY YSL boots...cuz..well its sparkly💖💖
Fashion Nova - Search Glammed out boots - silver $149 vs $10,000

Everybody wearing trenchcoats...coming 2018...to an office near you.
The soundtrack is lit! Can someone tell me how its called ?
julian and jones saved your franchise, don't let podesta destroy it by association , wake up
The last season sucked...hope this one is better.
What is the song that starts at 1:00 ????
It's nice to know that the end of the trailer had an Asgard, probably Thor, dealing with the situation. Any friend of General O'Neil's is a friend of good old Agent Mulder !☺️
Scully and Mulder? Omg, I can't believe they are back!!!
2018?! WHY?!
Netflix please bring back the x-files
Agent Scully's still hot.
im a little busy taking a knee, so probably cant watch

ohh and it has aliens again im so gonna watch this even though ill have nightmares
Been waiting 4 this for a long time...
The show has become so absurd and dreadful in a 'mad scientist slowly losing his mind' sort of way.
Looks like Krycek is the only person that's not returning from the dead this season.
where is the noire? :c
this season will be showed on tv in 1 year 1 is the first number number contains 6 letters 6 - 1 is 5. 5 + 5 is 10. 10 team 10 jake paul \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx files jake paul confiermeeeeeeeeeuuued
There is a god above...
omg the trailer is on fleeeeeeekkkkkkk can't wait for season 11!!!!!!!
Is this real??? I hope so.
I only watched the first couple of seasons. I liked it more when each show was more of a one off.
Oh no it looks bad
Scully ages like a fine wine! What is she eating or drinking?? Lol
First off didn't the Morley man get blown the fuck up in a cave after being shown with a tracheotomy? Second off please no more honky tonk budonkadonk, ever.
PHEW .... can breathe again there is another series ..... thank you!
Didn't all the Lone Gunmen die? Well I guess so did the CSM so anything is possible. I'm super stoked.
Note to self: buy another carton of Morley's....
Hopefully they run into Fringe Division.
People of earth and this must be connected.
Now just make season four of millennium
Every time someone says Agent Einstein' it sounds like sarcasm. Hope this season is better.
and rain pours down in vancouver, ha ha ha
Scully dies at the end of this season
no lot call officially makeup throat rub mayor pig talented wisdom.
British guideline matter bfhwl succeed own hungry landing both prime.
I don't like this, Skinner meeting with CSM.
The trailer looks amazing! So looking forward to season 11!
I would give it an extra thumb up for using a cover of Zombie in the background, that song was definitely in my 90’s soundtrack, I would sing it over and over again back then. Also... do they want to tell us something with that song? It’s all in their heads?
No more of those younger agents PLEASE! They were annoying and charismaless af.
Awe man! It's on! Can't wait
I loved that they brought the series back but it's almost it's own parody with some episodes. It's not dark like it was in the past. The fish man episode with the fake sex scene with Agent Scully really turned me off too last season. I mean when have they ever done anything like that with her character???
They all look great! Wow
That theme song never gets old.
makes me wanna take a knee
the rabbit hole just got a lot deeper than expected
Don't these two people hate each other in real life?
The X-Files, guaranteed to have more facts than fox news.
I love everything I just saw....everything...even the fact that they showed the same cut of Mulder looking around a corner twice to fill out the trailer.....
I’m the only one who’s watching this over and over again?
Finally more x-files.. the wait was to long..
Oh god It's Fine Though I live in Russia.
WTF
1:54 Statue of Morty's?

This is The X-Files 11th season... and my penis is 11 inches long. COINCIDENCE?!?!?!
Lol does  FOX know that the theme song is the Illuminati song on the internet
Aliens are demons, outer space is fake and .......\nThe Earth is _______FLAT!_________
Too bad the actors knelt in support of athletes who publicly disrespected the Flag.    If I boycott the NFL for spitting on the graves and sacrifices of our service members, then I boycott a show that I have watched since day one.  Too bad, it literally was one of my favorite shows.  Since day one.  If you want to protest, do not do it supporting the desecration of our Flag and Anthem, especially when it is based on lies and you are protesting the wrong people.
I really hope Season 11 is going to have the creepy spooky chilling vibe of the first six seasons, because the seasons 7-10 were so awful.
The little aliens are getting cuter. So cute.
I'll Be Your Pilot debuted at #7 on the New Alternative 40 Chart this week:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkY6RV0nVEA&list=PLxlSBzMcrtkMCVtuXEIz5BXpPfycTwsS5&index=7
I love how they can go back to their roots or evolve, but they never loose that beautiful characteristic sound.
Again the kind of music I put on at night and lay in the dark thinking of nothing but the music and the imagery it provokes <3 thank you for making my life better, b&s!!!
Just can't stop listening to it <3
Even a brand new song by you evokes a strong feeling of nostalgia in me 💛
3 days later, and I haven't been able to stop listening. This song grows in you, discreetly and without mercy...\n\nWell, most Belle & Sebastian does.
damm this is sweet
Cool that the best band in the world announce their new project on International Mental Health Day. I LOVE B&S <3
I LOVED
So I made the cover of this EP, the good looking one in the hat..
This is not nostalgia, it’s just a band doing the usual, without being affected by the poor music changes from the last 15 years
Omg this song is just as astonishing as Nobody's Empire 😍
it's like i'm watching life in a movie
Amazing work as always guys. Love it!
I'M IN LOVE
dig the song! here's a brief write-up we did about it https://zumic.com/ill-be-your-pilot-belle-and-sebastian-youtube-audio-single
I just loved it!
OMG new song!!  I love it
Can't wait to hear more!
Such a sweet song! Love you Belle and Sebastian 😚😍😘
Belle and Sebastian is Back!! *-* ..
It's just so lovely  and relaxing
❤❤❤❤❤ Thank u for making this
Man, this is beautiful.
omg I'm so excited! I love it! Thank you, Belle and Sebastian!
Wow! New sweet music of my favorite band!!! Love it! Thanx!
Love that oboe!
OBOE FTW!

I love this! <3
love LOVE love.
Sublime
Yaaay! :)
great work
Ich liebe Euch. Greetings from BVB-City.
Beutiful 😍 Love it 😊 Come to Mexico someday please :3
Needs a stronger melody and Lying here in the sweet sahara is like something a sixth former in English class would write.\nB&S were always bitter-sweet, but this is just plain mawkish.\nI loved Nobody's Empire and some bits and pieces off the last few albums, but it does feel like they've kind of petered out creatively.
Reminds me of the music from this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ocd1D8fwdjU
I love you, guys.
Nice try to retrieve some of your original sound. Utter failure though, atmosphere is lacking.
is extras kendricks favorite world?
hook melody sounds like an old 50 cent
King Kendrick
That cover is a picture of George W. Bush who lived in Compton for 6 months.
Bruh Kendrick is on some other shit 🔥🔥🔥
DOPE Yg Hootie Feat. the King
The City from the Game and Kendrick was superior.
only came here for kenny
HAVEN'T EVEN LISTENED AND I KNOW IT WILL BE FIRE
I dont know when people gon realize Kendrick do what he want he just dropped a dope verse for Rapsody everything ain't gon be a control verse. Just know he can when called for
Brah the chorus is so simple yet so dope! btw Feel free to check out our reaction to this gr8 song over on our channel
My nigga Kendrick
If you say kendrick “fell off” you need to “fall off” a cliff.
damn too hype way to hype
here before ansh
This song is fire
here before 1M? I must be dreaming...
THE CITY FROM GAME MURDERS THIS NO SKI MASK
I wish they didn't add that echo to Kendrick's verse. It's hard to hear the last words.
I used to get YG Hootie and YG mixed up since they from Compton but this is a solid track. Y'all hating on the Kendrick verse? It isn't GOAT but its fairly solid. He did his thing.
haven`t even listening but i know kdot`s verse will be fire
This is ok but kdot need to rap more💯
This shit was gay af
I've been a mogul...,I am an enterprise
Snapchat anyone?
KDOT ALBUM
Trust. 🔥
oooo Fuck🔥🔥🔥
Ten Toes Down TTD

Motivation
OU MAN, FIRST COMMENT
GOAT
is that george bush???
Who this dude in the picture
why do I feel like caketendo would enjoy this
🔥🔥🔥 From the West Side!
Dope!
🔥🔥🔥
Compton/Lynwood!!
What is the sample? That sound at 1:13 reminds me of an old school Eazy-E song
Just not feeling anything Kendrick this year.. why though his my favorite rapper of all time, is he falling like that
Trash i dont even want to smoke loud to this smh Kendrick going garbage juice #mytrueoption
k.dot saved the track......
okey
I'm a big Kendrick fan but I'm not feeling this. Usually Kendrick saves the track for me, not here.
FIRST, SECOND, THIRD AND FOURTH
The biggest fail, was when EA got the Star Wars License.
Thank you Joe for making me decide not to buy the game.saving myself $60. EA has lost it's way.
The only guy i trust reviewing games.
Everyone blames EA. They are not the only devs doing this, not even close. Everyone complained about season passes. Well, look, you got what you wanted. Free DLC....and then you get the other edge of that business sword. Gamers are a little responsible for this
Thanks EA... the gameplay is so good.. but you fucked it up...
Still can't believe they haven't put a timer on heroes like the original so you don't get over-powered Bossk like characters that can never be taken down with their regenerating health and super speed.
Games evolve all the time to more advanced ones and they get even more expensive to develop. So making games like in early 2000 is not going to be profitable nowadays. Money has to come from somewhere. I know it sucks but these are the facts
Didn't need more than 3 minutes of this before knowing exactly what this turned out to be. Slimey, greedy, rat-faced demons EA are. And other developers following suit because they see how pea-sized brained people are stupid enough to get hooked to these gamble schematics so easily.  Mostly younger generations and those vulnerable to gambling addiction will defend and promote these practices. Poor kids never knew any better.
This is why I play titanfall. No rng loot shit. No pay to win. Only cosmetics and those aren't rng you get exactly what you pay for.
Well.... I wont be getting this because the credits system... Basically in game people will be doing nothing just to get credits/boxes while people who try to win and pto get angry because of rubbish unhelpful teams doing nothing.... Nah I'm tired of team based games these days because I'm always the one carrying..... You should get more credits for being MVP doing stuff to promote team play.... But no .... Everyone gets same.
Which version of the game did you preorder
Man, are these companies TRYING to get governments to come in and regulate this stuff?!
Get ready for all the afk bots lol
If it was by kills, then the cheaters  would be a big problem.? People should stop supporting these games, only message they get is money loss.
You obviously haven't seen 2k18 this year
Dunkey was right in his e3 video, EA was going to find some way to fuck this game up
All this crap began with Mass Effect 3.
There is no point in buying a game that works like a free to play game, buy something else or start playing free to play games. This is the same as a free to play game but you have to pay for it because it's star wars. I did not buy the first battlefront, not going to buy this either. I like star wars but i'm not paying for that.
I hate piracy but sometimes secretly I want Skidrow/3DM like people to crack the hell of these type of games...fuck this bullshit
Just pirate it. Thats what i do to any game with micro's l, shadow of war wasnt even worth it though shit game
If I would be interested in playing online I would totally boycott the game, but since non of these problems will screw up single-player (I hope xD) I pre-ordered this game.
Don't know what to do about it? Don't buy the fucking game! I'm not gonna buy it cos this shit is unbelievable! I didn't buy Shadow of War and I ain't gonna buy this
I'm not buying bf2
I personally love the loot crate system. I think it adds variety to the game. I dont see why everyone is so upset about it. I wish EA's first battlefront game had the loot crates!!
It's $99 for us Aussies
The credits was only maxed to 180 at beta so when you play launch you will be able to get more crates and parts. Its not pay to win because you dont even need to touch the crates. You can grind for them and they will only contain skins for heroes and villians, trooper customization, ability upgrades you don’t need, and new abilities that doesn’t change much. You can have peace of mind and fun playing the game without indulging yourself into buying the crates. This system sucks but it is still good because they are easy to earn and only add minor bonuses rather than necessities. Plus you don’t have to pay for season pass dlc
AngryJoe became SadJoe at the end.  I feel ya brother...
You should NOT be allowed to sell the game for $60, sell season passes, AND fucking loot crates/microtransactions  up the wazoo.
Even if this game cost 5 dolars, i wont buy\n\nDon´t buy, don´t support pay 2 win style!!!
Beta was actually quite fun...until p2w effect took over. \nPlus the constant single hit pistols...omg
All hail CD Project Red.
Either make the game expensive without loot boxes, or make it free to play. But not both!!!! Both is ripoff man... i think people are just gonna play old games and fuck this greedy bullshit...\nGimme my super mario bros. Gimme Gta san andreas. Gimme fallout new vegas. Gimme resident evil 4... They are saying Fuck you suck my dick to the consumer plain and simple
I know what to do, all of us...Do...Not...Buy...It. In this world there is only one thing you have power on. And that's your money. Speak with your wallet and just straight up have some discipline and leave it on the shelf. Watch how fast they back track in future games when there sales take a hit. Shareholders will tell them, 'I dont know what your doing but stop it' Consumers of other products manage this, look at Palm Oil. It was in everything 2 years ago, moms all over the world just stopped buying it...now? Every food company is scrabbling to make palm oil free recipes. If you cant bare for 2 years to just say no to anything that have a lightsabre in it then it? serves us right. its easy, dont buy. Done
60 dolars ? ...just wait , like bf 1 ...the idiots wanted 130 euros on it ... youre fucking nuts ? how to spent so much money on a fucking game ? i kept the bf 4 and refused to buy it even when it was on sale , like 40 euros ... , well they dont get my money so easy :)
Call for a boycott
i swear if the game is like this i will go back to the 2005 Battlefront and stay thier for life.
Another channel credited you which lead we here. 👏
The fact this video has 2k dislikes, shows there are that many people who are retarded and support this loot crate bullshit, god I hate people.
EA, you fucked it up!\n$99.99 will get you 12,000 Crystals, this equals 11 Loot boxes for 1,100 Crystals each.\n(ingame prices for loot boxes may change for the release, but I don't except this to happen)\nI will boycott this shit and recommend cancelling Pre Orders.\nIf crackers can't destroy the gaming industry, the publishers will do!
I'm done. Not only am I not buying this game, but I am never going to buy another AAA video game ever again. At this point, I'd feel dirty giving them my money.
micro-transactions are the future of games. They just make to much damn money i mean look at GTAV lol
Have people forgotten about TinierMe on facebook? That game had the gatcha system which is pretty much loot boxes but instead of a box its one of those things that you put a coin in and get a prize in those plastic canisters. Well that game was removed because the Gatchas were considered Gabbling and kids were getting addicted to buying these things. One day I logged in only to see the game has been taken out and the info I got on why was because of this. The Gatchas were considered gabbling. The Gatchas are literally lootboxes. Why the fuck is ESRB not considering these loot boxes gambling.
It is the fad of the industry of gaming. Everyone does it to survive, almost. Or because they're greedyCREATIONCLUB.
How tragic that a game that did something different in a market spammed with FPS games, only ruined by these loot crates, i'm assuming this was EA's idea.
In 2020 you will have to wait 30 minutes to play between one match and another, or buy some god damn gems!!!
joe, i doubt you should be worried about multitransactions, because the government is now looking into multitransactions as a anti-trust issue now, and they're fixing to reach a decision what actions they should taker on them at any time now
Federal Government needs to step in and address this shit, its gambling pure and simple. Yong Yea said it best, that its exploiting peoples ignorance and human tendencies/weaknesses. KIDS will be buying this just because its star wars and they will buy these loot boxes because they are KIDS and they don't know any better.
Those loot crates just break the heart.
Already cancel my pre order after the beta. So looks like once again I will not be playing this series.
i was thinking of getting back into my ps4.. but this is ridiculous ill stick to Jesus. He wnt charge me loot crates
Idk why AAA games are trying to replicate F2P game on a mobile device...
Hey Joe? Have you played Divinity Original Sin 2? It really struck me as something you would really enjoy
they said they capped it at 180 during the beta so progression is gonna go by a lot smoother hopefully
I'll be selling a bot that will keep your character entering new games. That way you can grind while playing a better game.
Stupid Latino dickhead....
Why does dice need to hire another company for space battles when they did air to air combat perfectly in battlefields 3 and 4 and 1 like what????
150 days, almost  a half year game played, to get all those weapons, jesus what the fuck
Couldn't I just keep joining  games and afk for the credit
Don't buy this shit... really!\n\nThe only ones who have a good time are the share holders. Look at the EA shares over the last 10 years - it works!\n\nPeople are dumb as shit our days...\n\nFuck this game.
But? dont you buy these fuckers with In Game money? So if you're good at the game you get loot?
Loot box system has been fixed in a way guys! Weapons are now earned by playing with that class and you can only earn the highest level star cards by completing challenges. So that's a good fix in my eyes.
Lots of paid shills in the comments watch out.
Wait EA is milking its customers again!?!?!? No way, they would never do that!!! smh
Loot boxes sucks, but the system where it doesnt matter how well you do is fubar, not buying this shit
This need to stop!! We need to show developers that we don't accept this! Don't buy the game and don't buy the loot creates!! And the will remove it to save there game... simple
if u want a great star wars game, play republic commando's
Star Wars Battlefront 2: Loot Crate Edition
The problem with this game is they to cater to the shitty ass COD players who are whiny bitches that have 0 skill and are unable to play as a team.
this is today's games. Full of crappy dlc from last gen. Now we have loot crate from mobiles. what's next, I wonder. In a 10 year period, this online game would become useless and a toaster. The servers are dead which meaning these games will become disc freebee. I'm going back and play retro. At least those games don't give these bunch of bs back then.
Review the witch
Outro music?
720 BLAZE\n\nROFL FOR RIP
two gay guns
Install a trainer, problem solved
Godzilla is aproching the generator
Loot boxes lives matter!
You Can't Spell Cheap Without EA
They implemented rules and the system adapted to make it fair. AJ just wants that controversial $$$ from the vid.
Pretty sad that they took the gold crates concept from BF4 and made them pay to buy so you dont earn them by just ranking up. Now you could buy gold cases in BF4 but you could earn them by playing the game giving you a reason to play the game. My gripe with the first game was no progression system and no incentive to even play every match was like an un ranked game and worthless. Now this time they take one of your incentives to play through matches and hide it behind a pay wall. 1st one was fun for 2 days and then i ignored it this second one wasn't even hyped for it.
Oh, well. Why do we even care?\nThere is so many good games out there that are worthed talking about,\nand we're here giving attention to cash grabs that deserve none.
R.I.P Online console gaming your progression systems are crookery and only benefit players who foolishly buy into micro trans. GG IT'S BEEN FUN.
Aye angry joe, EA StarWars said credits were capped at 180 and progression was slowed. How are you about to dog on this game when it’s a sample beta ? Tf.
I'm so glad I don't like these kind of games  ;)
I'm boycotting this game by not buying it. I'm doing my part.
This an urgent message to everyone in the Angry Army. You need to boycott Battlefront 2 at all costs by any means possible (canceling pre-orders, just not buying the game, etc.). The time is now everybody. We have take action or else we will be forced to submit to the Loot Crate's power.
They fixed the loot boxes on their website. You won't be able to use the upgrade without being a certain rank first.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Even when Ea offers free dlc they still fuck the consumer. The game is fine but after playing the beta it put me to sleep tbh
Gamer boycott would be the only way to get the video game industry to stop shitting on us. The game crash of the 80's saw the end of producing the same disgusting shit over and over again. We got innovations that gave us Nintendo, Sega, Playstation and Xbox. Developers are getting stale again, and there's only one way for this to go.
soumds like a shitty cell phone game
Fuck this game
This is great news. Less salty players will buy the game now. I'm preordering right away.
Thank God I'm not interested in star wars
In its post, DICE and EA specifically address concerns about crates and progression, saying that “the complete system was not in the Beta and will continue to be tuned over time.”
I hope this shit's wont stay,\nA system that doesn't reward players so they'd have to buy fecal matter in a crate, what's next? buying virtual gun skins for real money?
!!JOIN THE RESISTANCE!! FIGHT BACK! Do not buy Battlefront 2, do not buy Destiny 2, do not buy Shadow of War, do not buy any pay2win game. Crack and pirate every single singleplayer pay2win game.

FIGHT BACK!
Im gonna boycot ea games now
fucking loot crates.\nFUCK!!!!
Don't get me wrong I hate micro transactions but it is either micro transactions or buyable dlc
Lootboxes aren't even are problem, people are just hating on if because everyone else is, smh
That’s like saying overwatch is p2w. You can earn the loot boxes for free
MASSIVE Thank you for everyone supporting me and making a dream reality! TG
What a sound guy .
Amazing to see you start off so small and make your dreams come true. Congrats!
That was amazing! They say never meet your heroes, but Al seems like a top class guy. I enjoyed every bit of that podcast.
Looks like Mike Ashley gave the podcast a listen http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41643718 - nice one Brian!
Great interview - so refreshing to have long enough to talk and not be squeezed into a slot. I could have listened for another two hours. I'd love to hear what he thought of the way the club treated Sir Bobby.
one of the best ever interviews ever with any footballer let alone legend shearer!
great podcast good job in setting it up, I was a kid when we signed shearer and got spoiled by how exciting football was as a toon fan then. He is a very smart guy, shame he doesn’t seem to want to get back into management
My mum dated Keith Gillespie when she was like 20
One of the best interviews on you tube awesome well done.
Genuinely the best interview I have seen. Top stuff
crystal palace are shit might come back to haunt you
Can anyone pinpoint the keane point
You know what. I'd love to see Geordie have a podcast with Lee Cattermole.
Some really good stuff in this podcast
I loved when he said Bellamy was tiny and then Lawrence’s laugh was delayed and then he became serious instantly after
quality interview mate , genuine honest and interesting , lost in todays society not just football
Gowan geordie maybe one day I could interview you ! You interviewed your hero and what a podcast it made ! Keep it up this is just the beginning of what's to come ! 💙
One of the best podcasts so far, amazing
Was very touched by this interview. I think TTG knows how much this means to all football fans in the area. Love.
missed this for ages.. great content. brilliant interview, (Barnsley fan)
Shearer is such a gentleman, no attitude issues or self-worship like a lot of the footballers have.
Should have asked his why didn’t he by the lads season tickets on purely belter
I've absolutely loved this interview, absolute CREDIT - to all 3 of you. A really well structured interview.\nWe all adore big Al, but we've passed judgement on his persona without really getting to know him. I think he bared his arse for us more than he had to - much respect.\nI love NUFC and I love Alan Shearer
why did you make it look like an interview
Great video but whos that other awkward chavy next to geordie
absolutely loved this best podcast I've ever seen no doubt
Great to see you talk with your hero.
Wow mate, I used to watch you playing Fifa career mode like 2-3 years ago. Unbelievable. Congratulations my friend and keep this up. Some more Footballer podcasts are needed!! Keep up the good work.
So they're talking about Rafa, how he stayed, how he's brought them back to the premier league then Lawrence is like so what influenced u to retire Alan I'm sat here gripped with them talking about Rafa and he just back tracks, like, do u even know what you're doing m8? Wtf?
i very much enjoyed this interview with Alan Shearer. Made me remember when i was a young lad when i used to support Man Utd Lol
True Geordie has come a long way, he has to be hitting the 1m sometime in the next year.
Class!!! Shearer was my hero growing up and hearing him speak about all the things you want to know about is quality... cheers for an amazing interview.
Also sry my name is adam I don't have a YouTube account I am using my wifes account 👍
I just love Shearer, everything about the man.
So happy  that you finally had your hero on the podcast
What a wonderful podcast. Excellent work guys!!
unliked so i could like this video twice. mad respect geordie
Wish me Dad was alive to watch this he would of loved this :) proud to be a geordie awesome podcast mate glad you met your childhood hero nice one :)
Find it kinda funny that the two fights shearer witnessed included former Leeds players haha, once Leeds always Leeds I guess
That was good stuff with the legend :)
Well that will never be topped TG. Meeting your boyhood idol. Well done . Howay the lads
So happy willne shouted this vid out in his twoti vid cause it didnt show up in my recommended
What is the name of the song at the start ?
Brilliant interview!! I think Graeme Souness was the manager at the time of the Boyer v Dyer fight? Al said Sir Bobby would have been disappointed.
What an honest guy.
Podcasts getting a lot better lad!
Louis Theroux would be class to get on 👌🏻👍🏻
Great Podcast! Think you should have hat films on the podcast they are youtubers as well and think it would be a hell of a laugh
Where are the fucking football hangovers?
Can anyone with asthma answer this survey please. This is for my dissertation and everything will be kept anonymous. THANK YOU \nhttps://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/6S2XZ9D
Terrific podcast, really enjoyed it, keep up the good work lad.
What a brilliant Interview. No punches pulled and raw AF. Loved it TG
can you do one about the big man's tattoo's..?..and another one about lawrence dick...oh no..that would only last 2 minutes...!!
Amazing podcast! Try and get Kai Greene on, that would be sick!
class podcast genuinely proud to have been a fan for a long time. MICHAEL DAPAH or MR TRAUMATIC would be great guests
I know most people wouldn't like this comparison , but Alan Shearer looks a lot like Fred Durst to me
So happy for you!!!
Never really thought much of Alan Shearer, other than he was an incredible striker. Watched the full 2 hours and I think he came across really well. Good interview.
Talking about Leicester aswell. I'm in love. Shearer knows what we did was something to never be repeated.
As A Boro fan ... Enjoyed that ..I met Alan a few times when he lived next door to my freind in Wynyard ( Kenny Lowe now manager of Perth Glory ) Had a party one night and all the guys had come in Fancy Dress ,,,Well TBH dressed a women !!! Mr Shearer turned up in a lovely silver dress !!! He is good craic , Comes accross different on the TV ....England legend
Well done Geordie , good on you mate !
Respect man... Ive been subscribed to you since 2014 and to see how far you’ve come on YouTube is absolutely great. You’re my favourite YouTuber and you deserve all the great stuff that comes your way
Sir Bobby Robson wasnt in charge when bowyer and dyer had a fight it was soueness lol
Did they turn Laurence's mic off
My Idol as well mate, watched him when I was younger on the telly. What an experience that would've been Geordie!
This is a great interview.  Shearer is my favourite English striker, and the best that I have been play.  I am happy to see True Geordie interview his hero and keep it real.
Absolutely Class podcast mate, congratulations on realizing a dream TG, as a Newcastle fan, this was amazing to listen to.
Shearer was a TOP class centre forward who scored all types of goals and was infact underrated.
It's all about money, tell me I'm wrong.
Shearer was a big part of why i started following NUFC, what a player. Great man too. Loved seeing TTG get the chance to meet one of his idols too. Great stuff. Keep at it fella. HWTL
Got emotional when talking about speed. RIP speedo I remember the day he died I just finished a Sunday league game was devastated
Absolutely brilliant TG. Big follower anyways, but what a two hours. Gripping stuff. Mr Shearer is a true ledge of the English game and gave me fantastic enjoyment down the years. He put a 'shift' in here too. And he pulls no punches. Cheers guys. Manc Red since 79 n all. Keep up the gud work lad.
This is one of the best yet, i feel like i say that every week. TTGP doesn't set the bar....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHEY ARE THE BAR!!
Very emotional last part. But so happy to see my favourite YouTuber make it even bigger than before
Get gazza on the podcast
2 hour podcast, 1 hour of Shearer swallowing his spit 😂😂
legendddd
Hearing Alan Shearer swear is weird
Fantastic! What an interview!
Interview with Willne’s dad
big respect true geordie.... nufc fan from kingston jamaica
Plz do a podcast with richard ayoade
Nigga we made it
Fantastic watch . Thankyou

Enjoyed that , thanks!!, Alan Shearaaaa Legend!
Great interview guys !!
Alan shearer like
R
Proud of Geordie
1:34:00
Get SHOLA AMEOBI on
Swear on my life im related to the Physio Paul Ferris< my second name is Ferris and hes my dads uncle and my uncle stopped Roy Keane from battering Alan after a united match
Next...Kevin Keegan...Rob Lee...and when he leaves the employment of Mike Ashley...Peter Beardsley...make these interviews happen
The way the Geordie looks at the gay dude is so sweet. Great that these two are showing such a positive side of homosexual relationships. Well done!!!
0:03 is that a young Brian?
Wish I could speak Newcastle so I could understand them :(
What a humble man Alan Shearer is.. He's also a straight talker, no bullshit and says exactly what he thinks. Not even a fan of Newcastle or shy of the teams he played for but so much respect for a good guy 👍\nMan I'd love a two hour podcast if you could get Paul Gascoigne on, imagine the stories he could tell lol.
as a Cork City born, American, who follows the 'Pool.     I love this, this is exceptional love of the game shit..... Respect big lad, I know what it means to you. Good work.
Your make up on this video is BOMB 💣💣💣
Yesss you did sooo good !! Keep going !!!
I'm sitting here nerve chomping my nails watching Tati wave around mascara whilst wearing a white shirt lol.
Tati! there is a website called shophush and they offer incredibly cheap makeup and eyeshadow palettes, some that look like doupes for almost all popular eyeshadow palettes and I would love it if you could do a review on some of them :)
Love the dior iconic overcurl mascara is amazing 😍😍
Fiona Stiles is on QVC!!    Soooo happy!
Tati u r so pretty
new essence products review plssss
Eyeliner pls!!!
hi tati...  plz try out the .... MatchCo app, a custom foundation-matching app! ..
You just spoke so well of the essence volume stylist lash extension mascara, that I just had to go and buy myself one! XD The formula looks a bit thick but it DOES make your lashes look beautiful! Thank you!
Versus firm jeans avsdfn else question drain personality processing uncertainty reporting.
Impressive!!!!  Love your Graveyard series!!!
Update skincare routine please
It still exists! http://fionastilesbeauty.com/
But Tati... where's your Chantecaille?!
Marc Jacobs and Lash Paradise both 👌🏻👌🏻
Love it !!!
OK I love Lash Paradise but what remover do you use to get it off? Holy shit it’s so hard to get off.
Hi Tati, could you please review and try the Doll 10 Hydralux foundation? Thank you 😍
Can you review juice beauty products please!!
i'm surprised by the lack of maybelline :0
Tati can you do foundation fave and hate? Also skincare too. I’m looking for it. Hope you can saw this :)
For the next video can you show at the end the box full of mascaras that you're getting rid off? I just feel that that would be very satisfying to watch haha
Love your lips and face makeup, hate it your eye makeup look too powdery and chalky... BTW you should comment all the products mention and pin it
If your mascara wand is one that isn’t plastic, one that is fluffy, you can usually bend them to reach all of your lashes perfectly. Just bend the tip of the wand on the opening of the tube. It’s such a good little trick I’ve accidentally tried!
Love the eye look!!
Tati's makeup is especially bright in this vid. Love it ❤
Hey Tati, I know this is weird but talking about lashes. I'm struggling to find one that curls my lashes all the way through the lash line. I have slightly hooded eyes like you, every curler I've tried doesn't curl my outer corner lashes because it touches my eye bone and it doesn't reach them, it's so annoying! What eyelash curler do you use? Or do you know some good ones for hooded eyes? \n\nLove you! ❤️\nAnd thanks for the help in advance.
Oh, who’s the mystery helper??
What lighting do you use other than natural lighting
I always love when you do a big declutter haul. It would be great if you could go through your best black eyeliners (eyeliners in general, water line, etc), and winter skincare routine! xoxo
Omg i have just saw more mascaras than i used in my entire life!
Hi Tati. Can you please do one one primer and setting sprays together? Thanks Tati❤️
I'm so poorly just watched 10 of your videos you're getting me through. I love you Tati 💕
Love your tutorials. Can you do a tutorial with zoeva products?

Tati is the definition of classy!!! 😍😍 LOVE YOU GIRL!!
Impressed by not keeping 101 and keeping 15, wow!
wait what happened to the benefit mascara?
you should try soap and glory's golden tube mascara!
Is it possible to create a list in the description box of what you keep for these kinds of videos, as a quick reference guide for when we next go to purchase a product.
Still waiting for Tati to make a video so we can see all the crazy mascaras. 🤔🙄
I love these videos!!
Tati? You don't have any Toofaced products? You should do a full face of Toofaced. 🙂
do it again, any product loved it Tati xoxo from Canada
Tati, we need a makeup set up tour!!!! I wanna know how your organize your makeup drawers/ how you sort and store them.
You can buy Fiona stiles at their website
I love when you do these and go through everything, I bring a pen & paper to the table and write down things to maybe try. The only thing that kinda stinks is since you put the name of the products before you say whether you like it or not, I end up having to pause and rewind to catch the name again but that's okay <3 Thanks for a great video
I love you so much Tati ❣️❣️
That glittery lower lash eyeshadow...and the red lip we and James love! 😍
Loling at the Too Face throw 😂
Loved the video! Always honest ❤️❤️❤️
your makeup is even better than usual in this video if that is even possible! so stunning!!
The description box actually made me crack up laughing! You know you have too much mascara when you can't even list all of them in the description box <3
HOLY! Loved this video, big thumbs up! Yes do this with your other makeup products! maybe palettes? snap family!
you should do a video using an actual aloe vera plant as a primer!
I like how composed her videos unlike some of the you tubers out there who’s just into leeching on brands
Idk why but i really want to highlight her collar bone
proud of you! you downsizing motivates all of us to do the same\n!
You always have the cutest clothes and accessories!!!!  Can you please put where you got them along with your daily make up 😘😍😘😍
Tati you need to try the dark blue version of the Catrice Glam&Doll, it's mind blowing
When you donate, where do you donate to? I lost all of my makeup collection in a house fire. I’m a MUA and it’s so upsetting. I love you Tati! I learn a lot from you!
Can I have the mini's? :(
somewhere in the distance bella hadid is crying over tati hating dior pump n volume
Why did she not keep the Roller Lash ? She said she was but in the final basket she didn't say she kept it
Please upload more videos like this, its super informative for a makeup newbie...love u tati!
I think this is the prettiest makeup I've ever seen on you.
Why grandiose? 😱😭 i've never tried anything better on my lashes 😱
Will you be reviewing the new Charlotte tilbury palette?
TATI!! I would love to see you test out Ciate London’s new glitter flip lip. It starts out as a matte lipstick but when you rub your lips together it turns into glitter!
Hey Tati, can you do a review on the Luxe Glitz Palette by Jolie Beauty??
It’s amazing that beauty gurus have an almost textbook memory for products they’ve tried. Like Tati just rattled off mini reviews almost for like 100 products! It’s kind of impressive she remembers specific experiences with all of those.
So confused a few months ago u said u loved Monsieur Big mascara and then in this video u pitched it like it was bad? I have never seen your natural lashes look better than with that mascara including Lash Paradise! With u taking the Lancome trip it comes across very confusing!
But what about better than sex and Lights camera lashes :o
Okay this was very needed. Thank you so much.
You wanna love yo self, you gotta date yo self honey! Hahah GOLD!! Ps you're an adorable human and I love this video.
So I need that mug
“Go get some exercise” does walking to McDonald’s count lol
Like,,,HOW is it possible i could love you more than I already do but THAT CLIP OF YOU SINGING NEXT TO NORMAL. DEAD.
I had a bad day and this helped so thank you💕✨
I find the best thing I do to help my mental health is cut out all (most) self deprecating humor. If someone else talked to me in the same way that I thought of myself I would not be friends with that person. It pays to be your own best friend and not worst critic.
I give myself support even tho I feel like a freak for going to online uni because of social anxiety
Cayleigh for real this is fucking brilliant advice, what a fab video x
I appreciate your Josie reference
We're not in the dark timeline, we're in *the darkest timeline*! D:
watch videos of baby sneezing and facing or just cats
First, your bathtub is incredible. Also this is much needed. Let's all be mad in this mad world.
I love how you balanced the seriousness of this video with humour, subscribed! :)
my love for you continues to grow, thank you so much for making this <3\n\nalso your bathtub looks amAZING OMFG
can we talk about how cute u look with bangs
I loved this video❤️
ive had to have two days off work because of my mental health (aka this Monday and Tuesday) and I needed this. Thank you cayleigh x
You're amazing! Have an excellent day and have faith it will get better!
yay for mental health awareness!ヾ(๑l 7 l๑)ﾉ this video is helpful and hilarious haha!
find a pet store and just go hold baby animals \ndon’t buy animals from pet stores or think about puppy mills while ur there though
you tell your self that your amazing and that you love you self even if you don't believe it you just say it and it helps i think i don't even know
Something that personally helps me is playing music/writing music but that’s a ~me~ thing. Also jamming to La La Land cause I’m a basic white girl
ah man i wish wine still helped rather than making everything worse, those were the days lol
Your bathtub is yuuuuugeee
1:03 holy shit that reference. this is why you're my favourite
The little positive messages idea is such a good concept!! I’m definitely going to start leaving myself little reminders. Thanks babeeee
bee and puppycat! (p sure)
Um.... Oh.  Uh... The link is no working... How can support Cayleigh? Helps please?
Even if the world is falling around you...there's always tea I need this on a mug
Yas Fran bow! Something that helps me is to go on little day trips somewhere (it doesn't have to be far or expensive). I also like coloring books as well as baking.
Isn't it really late where you are?
Awesome vid💖💞❤️❤️ i Love it! Can you make a room decor...... Just any kind of room decor hahahhaha! Anything you make is awesome❤️💖💞
YASSS GIRL GETTIN THOSE SPONSORSHIPS!! Btw this is one of the best vids you've ever made❤
Hai cayllles. I love ur vids and really love ur drunk storytime with Cinderella, so I was wondering if u could make another one of those plz I would love to see one ❤️
I SAW THE FLOWER BOY ALBUM COVER AND I SCREAMED
I need that Rick T-shirt for my mental health please where do I find?
Just buy some fucking straws, they make drinking more enjoyable
No one's freaking out about the bangs bit so I will omg I was so shocked for a second then I was like omg that looks so good on her then I was like ohhhhhh\nA true rollercoaster well trolled Cayleigh
Mental health is a real problem! Please don't ignore it if you want some help talk to someone it helps!

Tea is magic
@chipotle sponsor this girl

Self-care suggestion: Watching Ron Swanson compilation videos while eating steak

Hi!
was that franbow?
mozart was crazy 🎶💕
This video is wonderful, thanks Simon. My mental health is bit of a dumpster fire at the moment and all these world mental health day discussions are catching me off guard, but I think are exactly what I need, if that makes sense. Midwinter was a book that destroyed me, and I didn't even have the personal connection you did - there's just something so vulnerable and beautiful about a book that expresses sadness that well. I read my favorite book (The Mill on the Floss) when I was going through a rough patch, and it just articulated things inside me that I'd never thought were important enough to be captured on paper. Anyway, going off on my own tangents now, thanks again for your thoughts
From a person who suffers with mental health issues I send you much love Simon. Thank you. 💚
Great video Simon and thank you for sharing your mental health story with us. I absolutely agree that books can help with some mental health symptoms/ situations. I suffer from anxiety and depression, with some periods of my life the depression was more intense and others the anxiety was more intense. I still get anxious about work related things or personal relationship where I feel that I didn't do something right or good enough and will go over it in my head. I have learned that I need to debrief at the end of the day by having time to escape into a book and have a cup of tea. This helps me to get away for a bit and not dwell on things that can be irrational. I think this was a helpful video and was great to hear how books assisted you through some of your mental health situations.
Simon thank you so much for this video and your honesty in it. Books have definitely helped my mental health in terms of self help books building up my self esteem and resilience, but also like you say getting lost in fiction. The times when my physical health has been really bad I don't know what I would have done without books - I so needed that escape. Thanks again for this video xx
I am glad that you bothered. Beautiful video. Thanks so much for sharing.
Can I just say that hearing your wonderful voice always makes me feel better! I had a period of stress related mental illness in 2014 and sadly it affected my ability to concentrate on books. Nothing worked and only gradually has my concentration improved. It's still not back where it was, but is much better. Your video is excellent in that it shows people that bad things can happen to good people and we never know what someone else is going through. People do care though and book clubs are excellent places to find non judgemental friends!
Simon I love your wise words. I always look forward to watching you, and hearing about book selections. Great video.
Thank you for this video! You bring brightness in my life, I love to listen to you speak about books, or other things, it's always funny and/or interesting. \nI often feel lonely - even if I'm not alone -, but I love to be alone sometimes, which I thought was a bit weird of me. You speaking about it makes me realise I'm not the only one feeling like this, and it really helps! \nBooks have helped me through life, when I was lonely, when I felt rejected, when my parents divorced - I was too young and didn't understand, thought it was my fault in fact -, and they still do now, when I feel anxious, or unloved. I know I'll always be a bit weird, but it is a thing I must accept and live with, a part of me. \nThank you once more, it was great of you to make this video, really!
Thanks for making this video, and being so open about your past experiences. This video has definitely helped me! :) xxx
Fantastic video!  Thank you for sharing.
I think this was a good video. It is a personal thing indeed but I think that readers, or rather big readers are often people who have experienced mental health issues and have found solace in books. In 2005, there was a summer I would come home every day from work, go to bed curl up with a Jane Austen, I read all her books a couple of times that summer and Persuasion I read more than 10 times that August. I was in a very bad place and somehow Austen just got it. And then slowly I got better.
This video and your honesty with us was exactly what I needed right now, Simon! Thank you very much!
Thanks for this Simon, it's always reassuring to hear other people talk about going through the same/similar things as I have. Books are definitely a solace. When I feel in need of comfort I read Nancy Drew mysteries as they take me back to childhood!
Thank you for making this video! Reading and books have always been there for me when my depression is bad.
Thank you so so so much for posting this Simon! As someone who has suffered from depression and anxiety in the past I think its so important to us all to talk about it and know we are not alone. I think books of all kinds can not only be therapeutic for us when we are going through a difficult time mentally but also physically. I know myself when my physical health has been bad it then has had a knock on effect on my mental health-reading has helped me escape for a while when physically the only choice ive had is to rest, read and escape! :)  Thanks again -you're a gem! or a gem of a bear you might say! :) xoxx
Reading can make you escape in the darkest of times. I feel that's what's informed my reading from a young age and what let me find fantasy novels as an escape from reality since a young age. Thanks for making this video and opening up a discussion!
Ahh I love the video!
Thank you for sharing, Simon! As someone who is suffering a great deal from a debilitating  mix of depression, anxiety  and stress, I felt a lot better just to listen to another person who has been through it before. It made me feel less lonely and really hopeful about overcoming it all.
Thank you so much, Simon! It is really helps.\nI've just started to take meds for depression last week, finally gave in =D. Mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, also fear of death, etc. have been with me from teen years, more than a decade already, and well, it is hard. At the moment I'm winning, because I've learnt how calm myself, even without meds (internal dialogue). Movies, TV shows and sleep are my other treatment. Unfortinately, I have this problem when I can't really concentrate if I feel sad or am caught in a loop of depressive thoughts, so I can't read. Hope that this tendency will pass with time.\nLots of love to you. Stay strong!
This was a wonderful video, Simon.  Thanks for your honesty in sharing your mental health experiences.  I often have suffered from hormonal depression, but never to the extent that is was an issue for me.  \nReading has been a lifeline for me when I have been through some pretty horrible experiences.  I don't have too many memories of before I was 11 when my parents split up.  Reading was my saviour then.  I was sexually abused for about 5 years in my early teen years, and later on my stepfather was a horribly abusive alcoholic.  Throughout all those years reading was my safe place - and it continues to the place where I feel least threatened by the world, where I feel the safest, where I feel I belong and where I don't have to do anything or be anyone but myself.  \nNowadays my own life is a lot less harrowing but my 31 year old son suffers from schizophrenia and my daughter has been diagnosed with clinical depression as well as fibromyalgia so mental health is very close and all around me.\nYou and I have vastly different tastes in reading - I am a popular fiction reader through and through, but your channel is such a welcome relief from all the noise noise noise that goes on in this world.  You are a lovely man and I always look forward to your name popping up in my subscription feed.  Thank you for your content and I wish you nothing but wellness and happiness.  Love from NZ
Lovely video Simon; I appreciate your honesty about mental health.  I needed this, as I am a bit shaky in the mental health department right now. I would like to hear your review of A Line Made by Walking.
Simon, thank you so much for this video! I've been going through a bad patch lately, and have been for pretty much this whole year, but I've found myself reading a ton lately and it has helped me so much. Books really can act as an escape and a way to not have to think about what's going on around you for a bit. I've truly found that books have helped me tons over the years I've been an avid reader.
Thanks so much for creating and sharing this video. I was completed sucked in, and enjoyed the bits you would have edited out - love seeing that stuff. On the topic of dealing with grief, have you read H is for Hawk? I own a copy, but haven't read it yet, but it generally comes up a lot on the topic of grief and processing change, etc. and comes highly recommended from the BookRiot gang. Anyway, I really appreciate this video, and generally, your videos are always a bright spot in my day no matter how things are going. Thank you!
Thank you so much for making this video and being so open. I work as a mental health therapist and I’m often talking to people about what they are reading and how it helps. It is definitely something people struggle with more than we know. I truly believe every time someone shares their story they make someone else feel more “normal”. Thank you for being brave.
So needed, great video.
This video is wonderful, I've been feeling down lately and your videos always cheer me up. It's wonderful to see more people talking about mental health.
Was having a terrible day today (just woke up like that) and this was great to see. Didn't even know i needed it until I clicked. Thanks x
I don't have a lot to contribute to the conversation, but I really loved this video.
Suffering from mood swings since going through menopause, I know exactly what you mean and you're right, reading helps!! Watching book tube videos helps. But I have phases when I can't read depressing stories or very suspenseful stories but there are a lot of other books I can read instead! Thank you for be so honest about your problems.
Thanks for sharing, I send you lots of love and hugs simon. xxxx
I wish I could 'love' this video. *massive virtual squeeze*
You are wonderful and life affirming and a joy! Thank you for all your vlogs but especially this one.  You said so much that i am going to ponder over. A couple of things about reading helping mental health in my experience: depression is exhausting and especially talking to people during depression is just too much effort. I crave silence at that time but as yiu say that can cut you off. But you can read, think, and in a way interact while being silent when yiu read. Also reading is like exercise or maintenance for the emotions and mind on a daily basis. We develop and hone our responses and capacity for imagination and empathy while we read and that pays off in hard times.
I recognized what I interpret as nerves near the end about sharing this, and I just wanted to say that I am glad you did.
That is such a touching story (I'm at the story of 10 year old Simon) and I'm sending you good thoughts.
Can I give this video like milion thumbs up...?
Wow, great video Simon. I loved reading A Line Made by Walking and Midwinter too and it's so moving hearing how you connected with them personally.
Thank you Simon for this video. I suppose it was really hard to talk about it, for that reason I even more appreciate you shared your experiences with us. Sure it will provide help/support to others. Thank you again :)\n\nPS. You are absolutely right, your channel  does bring happy moments :)))) (plus some serious added value as well)
A wonderful video thank you! I appreciate all you've done and said. Sending you love
Powerful. This is a video I shall return to again and again. ❤️
Thank you so much for your brave video. Really honest, vulnerable and important! Wanted to give you a big hug at the end :)
I am really glad you decided to upload this video. We do share some similar experiences, especially regarding grief, so, as you said, it‘s so helpful to know you‘re not alone.
This was a truly lovely video Simon. Thanks for sharing. Reading is generally speaking a source of stress relief for me, but as you said it can also be a balm in terms of finding others (whether fictional or not) that have had shared experiences. I have gone through one or two periods of intense anxiety and that actually makes it really hard to focus on reading. I've found that audio books are actually better when you have too much nervous energy so that you can take walks or run or whatnot and at the same time listen to a story. Stories can really help draw the mind away from negative loops and focus on something else.
Thanks so much for doing this video and for being so open. I can relate to what you were saying about reading being helpful for your mental health and comforting you through tough times. although it's only this year that I have returned to reading & found book tube and it has a been a real comfort and life saver for me. I have read 80 books since May when I started reading again and I can't believe that I stopped reading for 7 years!!! Thanks again for sharing 😍
Thank you so much for this video!! I live with a mental health condition and at its worst it makes me very socially isolated (nature of the beast innit?) but books have always kept me feeling connected to the world, at least in some small way and have proved invaluable. I've always loved the Jeanette Winterson quote Art is an air pocket in an upturned boat,  that's what books have been for me. Also - sometimes if I struggle to engage with the world and have to retreat for a while, when I start to feel ready to re-connect I find spending some time knitting (other crafty pursuits are available! ;) and watching a backlog of booktube videos enormously therapeutic. It allows me that 'halfway house' of feeling like I'm hanging out with lovely people while not having the immediate pressures that socialising entails. So, yes, thanks, loved your unedited honesty - wonderful video!
Thanks Simon you probably just helped a lot of people.
This is great. I have a mental health blog and agree, although I am not a doctor, just sharing what works for me does help people so thank you. And thank you for talking about MH too! I would love a goldsmiths video and or a line made by walking video. All of the videos. ALSO. Can you tell us when the dates for the costa are? Like longlist and shortlist and announcements? I can't find it anywhere but I might just be being silly. Xxx
Thanks so much Simon, I found that really helpful. I started reading again because of grief, my daughter died. I found comfort and understanding in books. It helped me comprehend what my family and I was going through. I still look out for good grief stories.
This is wonderful. I needed this video right now.  Thank you thank you thank you.
Fantastic video. I've also had issues in the past, and often still struggle with anxiety, it's great to hear people speaking openly about these things. I also think books definitely help. I'm a bit of an introvert (like a lot of bookish people I suppose) and have a tendency to isolate myself. I went to a talk last night and Ali Smith mentioned isolation and reading, how you can feel alone and go and sit by yourself in a room, but as soon as you open a book that room fills with people.
Thank you for sharing your own experiences Simon .Reading helps me escape. 👍sleeping helps too. XXX
There was one book I picked up after my brother died that helped me a lot.  The best part of this book was being told to acknowledge your feelings and allow them to be...for a bit.  It was also good to have an activity to do, something that made me feel like I was doing something to dig out of my pit because the book actually has tasks to work through.   I still grieve for him 12 years later but it doesn't take me into the pit of hell when it comes over me now.  The Grief Recovery Handbook  by  John W. James, Russell Friedman
This is one of my favourite videos of yours. Thank you for addressing this difficult topic that's also been/is very present in my life, and for being so vulnerable and honest! I'm going to try and get my hands on a copy of A Line Made By Walking asap. Thanks for doing so much good, Simon! x
Great video! And what an important topic!\n\nMy first major downward spiral was about 12 yrs ago. I had just discovered Audible and, wanting the biggest bang for my buck, I searched for the longest books with the best ratings. I stumbled onto Outlander by Diana Gabaldon and was instantly captivated by Davina Porter's narration and the main character of Claire. Davina's Claire became my best friend. She was smart and tough and I just fell into her story. Reading was definitely an escape from terrible things going on in my real life but also gave me a reason to hang in there through each day so I could listen to the next chapter at bedtime. That book is 40+ hours long so it lasted many many days. And there are a ton of sequels. I'm not exaggerating when I say that Claire saved my life. Eventually I made my way to therapy and a good doctor. But I'd never have made it that far if it weren't for that book that just hooked me. I hope everyone who struggles with depression finds a book, or many books, to fall into one day at a time.\n\nOn a side note, you are looking particularly handsome today Simon! (Swear I'm not a stalker. Just speaking the truth 😊)
Brave video Simon, and beautifully delivered.  I also like to be alone, but not lonely, and given my physical isolation, I feel like my Booktube family are my most important and easiest to access portal to a social life with like-minded people.  I'm in a beautiful place and mostly thrive on the isolation, but some days I'm so glad when you pop in for a chat.  You are funny and wise and self-deprecating, such good qualities in an imaginary friend.\n\nOddly enough, I've just begun reading a short story in bed at night before going to sleep and it helps enormously.  I'm currently reading 'The Day I Ate Whatever I Wanted'  by Elizabeth Berg and it's very good.\n\nIncidentally, I've also just finished Tin Man (recommended by you and others).  Absolute heartbreaker and I loved it.  Thanks for the chat.
Wonderful video, Simon. Hugs and more hugs.
You are such a good egg Simon, you really are. Talking about mental health needs to be continually kept relevant. I can't even talk about the things which have effected my mental health in the past ... you are very brave xx
Thank you so much Simon. This was a wonderful video! I truly appreciate your openness. My aunt introduced me to Will Schwalbe's beautiful book.  I've also read his more recent work, Books for Living.  He is a wonderful bookish companion. I cannot imagine a life without books. I find such solace in reading. Thank you again for sharing your own experience.
amen....to all the here's to's that you mentioned..and here's to sharing as best we can and here's to you simon for your generosity in creating this video.
Best video yet! Thank you for sharing your very personal story. I can relate. I’ve had anxiety for a long time and my depression spurts come and go as well. I agree that books can be a form of escapism. Reading them as well as just wandering around bookshops works for me. I also have a rather large dvd collection if I need a quick escape fix. I also think is true that every once in a while we find a book that speaks to us and leaves us all a little less lonely. All my best to you!
It is an amazing gift you've given us by sharing your journey - calmly, kindly, warmly. With regards to the grief, A Year of Magical Thinking, by Joan Didion, made me realize I wasn't alone.
Thank you for sharing. I think we put so much emphasis on being yourself and uniqueness in general that we forget how important and comforting it is to be reminded that, in the end, we're actually not so unique. I am not the only person in the world experiencing a problem. Someone else has been there. You are not alone. Someone else has felt that. Etc.
Thanks for such a wonderful video Simon! Mental health is exactly what you said, something that we need not be afraid to talk about! I'm so glad to hear that you liked A Line Made by Walking. I was recently able to pick it up for only a few dollars as an ebook. I'm really looking forward to getting to it!
I don't even know where to start with this comment - I have been binge watching BookTube today and thinking about starting my own and I come across your channel at 1:30am - firstly it's lovely to find a fellow Brit, secondly, it's lovely to see someone my age and thirdly, I think you are basically the male version of me!  (I should state I love ALL BookTubers, but meeting a Brit the same age as me has given me renewed hope that I can indeed give this a go!\n\nI smiled, I LOL'd and I teared up watching this.  I haven't ben through anything like what you have but so much of your journey sounds like mine - I loved it when you said I don't like feeling lonely but I quite like being alone. this is something I have struggled to get other people to understand so it is refreshing to hear someone else say it.  And I totally, TOTALLY have the paranoia thing too, in fact it's what caused me to lose a job 18 months ago .. well that an the panic attacks I was having almost daily (mostly due to the paranoia and anxiety I experienced in my role and at the place I worked,\n\nThank you so much for opening up so honestly and eloquently (tangents are fun). I shall stop here otherwise .. well it's nearly 2am now and I really should get to bed ..!\n\nPS - you have a new stalker ;)
Thank you for this heartfelt video. When my sin died I spent a lot of time with Jane Austen. I know those characters/people so well and they never let me down. I didn't want any surprises or mysteries just good writing and friends (well, Elizabeth Bennet is my friend!). Thanks again.
Excellent video, Simon. I'm sure that wasn't easy to share such personal moments but thank you for sharing your story with us. I think so many of us have suffered at one time in our lives with mental health, but it's so great to see so many people opening up about their struggles and breaking the stigma against mental illness. I can't think of any books in particular that have helped me through a particularly rough patch, but I definitely turn to books (and booktube!) as a source of comfort or distraction when life gets hard.
Thank you for sharing this video it really helped. I suffer with mental health and it's nice to hear that I'm not alone in how I'm feeling
thanks for sharing your experiences, Simon. I think videos like this always, always help! glad you decided to make it :)
Thank you for sharing! I think it’s hard to share something so personal. I have suffered with depression and anxiety for years. It’s been fine for awhile, but I lost my dad in December last year which triggered my depression. I have struggled all year. The reason I’ve said this is because I’ve tried to read for escape, but it is just not working for me. I’ve been in the biggest slumpiest slump of my life since he got sick in November of last year. I’ve read 30 books. I’ve probably started and put down 100. It’s just so frustrating because I want to read, but I just can’t. I’m hoping to pull out of it soon because I agree with you that it is good for depression.
Thanks for such a personal video Simon, it's actually really refreshing. I've never really thought of reading and how it relates or influences my mental health before, but I now realise that I am someone who, when lonely or depressed, either obsessively reads or gets in the biggest slump ever. There is no in between. \nThe specific books I read also tend to influence my mental health, as some books really give me a real 'high' (mostly because they're just really good books), whilst others really depress me. And I don't even always know specifically why a book has had a negative influence on my mental health, so that's a bit annoying.\nI can see how this video (and others) may feel like therapy, as just reflecting on such things in my mind sort of felt like therapy, haha.\nI'm really intrigued by A Line Made by Walking, but I feel like I may relate to it more if I read it in a couple of years, so I'm in doubt whether or not to buy it..
I have the same issue. Some days are wonderful and my excitement is off the charts and others days its like the world is upside down. I know you were hesistant to do this video but I appreciated hearing someone say they have the same issues I do. Makes ya feel not so alone.
Thank you so much for sharing this video. It's really helpful to hear about others' experiences and how different people get through the difficult moments in life, however long they last. Big hugs from me and my cat!
Yes Simon, I feel the same way as you.  I like being alone alot but I do not feel lonely when I’m reading because “books are my friends”.  Totally agree.  Thanks for sharing!
It's been really helpful to watch this semi-cuppa and a catch up/ reminisce with you Simon.
I suffer regularly with depression manifesting in self doubt, paranoia and manic spending.  Events over the last 2 years makes it hard for me to feel people truly like me for who I am or will hurt or leave me.  Recent health issues mean that more than ever my hobbies root me to reality and for this it is reading and art journalling.  I started Youtube last year and have done some book buddy reads and chatted with some lovely people.  I am so pleased you felt comfortable enough to be so open about something so personal xx
Thanks for this video. I work from home, which a lot of people think is the dream, and it is a really lonely 😔 I miss out on socialising out of office hours because I have fibromyalgia which makes it hard to sit in a hard chair for a long time and I need my rest. Your videos really help me feel less lonely. I do worry it’s a bit sad that I feel I know you but it always cheers me up to see a new video from you no matter the topic... well I would draw the line at Simon goes hunting or something 😂 I’m currently reading it’s all in your head. A guide to getting your shit together by Rae Earl at the moment which I think is meant for a slightly younger audience than me (I’m 40) but nonetheless is a good book on different facets of mental health and where to go or what to do to help yourself. Anyway thanks for the videos xx
Brilliant video - thanks for sharing :)
Brilliant, Simon.  Thank you.
Thank you, Simon. <3 <3
I completely agree that everything is spectrums, and that we should be open about our experiences when it is safe to do so.  Thanks for sharing, Simon.
My parents died in my 30s and i wasnt. ready.  I dont think anyone really is.  It wasnt books that got me though it was my Dads records the swing of Goodman and the jaxz of Coltrane and Miles. I wish i had Grief is a thing with feathers back then.
Thanks for this video Simon, and sorry to hear about the difficult times you’ve been through. I can definitely say that your videos - and those of some other lovely book tubers - have helped me an awful lot during some low times, so thank you! Also, books themselves have helped me to escape, take my mind off things and have sometimes reminded me that there are other people out there who have felt the same things as me, and have put it much more eloquently than I ever could. That’s the reason ’A Line made by Walking’ is one of my favourite books of the year too. That and the beautiful writing.
i swear the pill is free from the doctors?
I just started mine today, and I started really thinking about personal, sadly uncorrectable issues and I had a breakdown. I’m not sure I’ve ever done this before so it freaked me out. I honestly need someone to talk to yet I can’t without someone getting upset with me. It’s extremely difficult because I feel like I’m giving my all and no one seems to take notice. For instance, I’m 15 and looking into collages, I’m two weeks ahead in my school as well and yet I didn’t go to school today for the main reason of my cramps are hell and I need sleep to get rid of them. I got mad at and then heard my guardians bad mouthing me because they were aggravated at me. I’m too scared to talk to my nana (which is my guardian) because she’s hypocritical and one of those “if you don’t agree with me you have a mental illness or taking an attitude” kind of people. I need to talk to her about my emotions yet she will most likely tell EVERYONE she knows. My two friends could care less about my struggles because they’re self centred so I gave up on that. I don’t know why I’m spilling my guts out here, probably because I’m too scared to ask for a professional and I’m too scared to speak up for myself, but I honestly feel like it’s all  going to come out during this period and i feel manny breakdowns coming, possibly leading to a depression state. Sorry for all of this, I just wanted to give my emotional experience because you seemed to be having something similar and maybe I can receive help from others here.
I started SUPER early. Also I'm an absolute arse because of mood swings.
Is there anyone else out there with easy periods? And why do you think you have it easy? This is something I rarely hear and would be nice to hear thoughts on. \n\nI have rarely any pain and feel calm during my periods. PMS is more difficult time for me.
Just so you know there is tons of gluten in beer so that could still be a thing lol. It's a shame that you've had such different experiences with your doctors.  I think a bunch of doctors were sued for prescribing Yasmin because of the people who have died so they are probably trying to cover their asses to get you to switch to a different pill.
I was so happy when I had periods for the last 2 months - I have PCOS and go several months without getting a period naturally, so getting it twice in a row suggests the changes I've made recently are helping 😊
oh god. right before my period, i get insanely emotional. i cried literally all day yesterday! i'm on the pill, but i just switched, since it has been messing with me insane level.
Hey Lucy, at the moment I’m confused about my period as my 9 year old niece is on it and so is my 27 year old sister.  I’m 12 and I haven’t started yet but  struggling to tell my mum I’m worried about it as I have anxiety and can feel really sick over simple things like asking a question, what should I do? Love you lots Xx
I'm currently on Pirmella 1/35 which is generic for Nortrel, and I'm pretty sure it has worsened my depression and made me more tired than I already am. I can't really tell if some of what I feel is a side effect of the pill, or if it's just recent events, because I've been on the pill for 4 months now, but I've also been going through a lot of stressful events since the week I started it. I'd love to hear about other people's experiences with it so that way I can get a feel for what is what here.
I´ve been on both estrogen and non-estrogen birth control pills and the main side effect that I could not tolerate with any pill was having to pee literally every 20 minutes. Sorry if it´s TMI but I was really wondering if anyone else has ever experienced that symptom! I did get headaches, weird moods and bloating as well but having to wake up every night at least 4,5 times to pee was making it impossible to get decent sleep and I ended up walking around like a zombie. I have no idea how all the different pills have affected my bladder so badly and when I mentioned it to the doctor she made me feel like I am some weird person and I am making it up. So yeah, I couldn´t put up with this anymore and I don´t think I will ever go back on the pill.
I was on the pill for four years. I had tried different ones and I had found one that I felt was the right one for me. But when I broke up with my boyfriend of the time, it made no sense to still be on it. So I stopped taking it. The change was madness. My body changed, I gained a lot of weight, my skin had an acne crisis (I had never been an acne-ridden teen back in the day, so I had no experience whatsoever) and I remembered what mood swings were like. However, I felt more alive than ever (my sex drive was high) and more like myself, so I persevered on not getting back to it. After more than a year, though, everything got stable, my skin went back to normal and I lost weight. my general mood, despite the swings, was higher and so was my energy. I think us women follow a cycle and that is perceived as something negative, whereas I think it should be embraced and owned. I figured, with perspective, that when I was on the pill I was more reasonable most of the time but I didn't feel as connected and engaged with reality as I do now. (I live in Barcelona and none of the pills' names mentioned ring a bell, so I haven't mentioned mine) Thank you so much for bringing the subject into debate, it's so good to have someone talk about it publicly. Love your vids! xx
Hi, Not sure if anyone has commented about this yet as there are a lot of comments but I'd like to ask some advice if anyone has any.\n\nSo I was on the usual combined pill for 4-5 years and I always had regular periods and if I ever missed a day I would immediately get my period. However, I recently found out that I was increasing my risk of stroke by using that pill and was immediately changed to the mini pill which immediately stopped my periods all together, I decided after 4 months of no period to stop taking it as it freaked me out a lot and I was very conscious that I was in a reasonably new relationship and the constant waiting for my period was causing anxiety so I've gone off the pill. Its been a month now though and no signs of my period have come back. I've read a lot about it online and a lot of people have said that it can take months and months for it to come back but I just wanted to hear from some other people on the topic? (My boyfriend and I used other forms of protection always at this time since stopping the pill, I've also had 3 pregnancy tests, two at home and one at the doctors because I'm so worried about it)
Lucy which is the ingredient in yasmin that should be prescribe as an acne treatment? To stop women taking accutane, i cant understand what you said 😞
LOVED this video - it's so important to talk about pill experiences! I've been on the pill since I was about 15 years old due to hurrendous pain which meant I wasn't able to do anything and on one occasion actually passed out. I started on Marvelon and it was a saving grace. Then when I moved to uni they told me they didn't have it so put me on Gederal 30/150. I tried that and started to have bad cramp again, not as intensely as before but still uncomfortable. They put me on another one (can't remember what it was called) and that caused migraines so they then put me on the POP. For 6 months I was bleeding unexpectedly and heavily. So I went back to the doctors and they instantly put me back on Gederal 30/150 because I said I would prefer to have a bit of pain over unexpected, heavy bleeding. I've been on that since April and all was well until three months ago three/four days before my period was due I began to have 'heart flutters' as though I was nervous about something. Then the day before my period I began to feel anxious and worried about everything, including being around customers at work. This has happened for three months consecutively now and the only thing I can put it down to is my pill.
Lucy! I made a video kind of talking about my expierence off the pill and mentioned you because this vlog completely turned my around mental health!!! Check it out if you wanna, I figure i'd put it out there (: \nXx
GO ON THE MIRENA COIL! It's the best!
I can't handle yeasts either - including vinegars, fermented foods & drinks, sugar, refined carbohydrates & mushrooms. It can be connected to candida. Best of luck finding your root cause & thanks for the pretty vids.
I was lucky that the first pill prescribed to me (gederel) worked well for me. I think I became way less emotionally stable, started bloating more and found my weight harder to control but I got a boyfriend and went to university at this time, so it’s hard to know whether this was actually the pill or just me changing as a person. I came off my pill about 3 weeks ago so we’ll see if anything changes with my emotions!
I never get mood swings during my period, but im not sure if thats because I run my pill packets together lol
I was in a similar boat to you, except Yasmin dried up my sex drive and gave me awful PMS. I’ve been on nuvaring for the last 3 years and it’s perfect. The hormones are released locally so a much lower dose. It’s made my mood great and I actually lost weight!
I was on microgynon and i felt horrible. I stopped hormonal contraception since 5 years, also went vegan and I have never felt better.
Does anyone have any post-coming-off-the-pill-acne advice? I've been off the pill for almost a year now and my skin just keeps getting worse and worse... I don't really want to get any medication because I know it's hormone-related so that wouldn´t really be effective. Also my hair has been getting SO greasy so quickly which is so annoying, I could literally wash it every 6 hours urgh any tips pleeeease
LUCY YOU STUNNER (also thank you for talking about the pill because youtubers like you, hannah and melanie are the only reason i know anything about sex/contraception/hormones because school teaches you nothing) xx
Also my rule I follow is to take what your doctor says with a pinch of salt. I know how wrong they can be lately. My mum almost died because of a doctor and she keeps letting them just fob her off.
I'm on the desogestrel contraceptive pill, which for me means that I don't have periods and it's completely fine and amazing! No mood swings and no physical annoyances. I've been on this for 6 years and haven't had a period since then. My doctor ensures me that this is completely fine and healthy. 10 out of 10, would recommend.
hey! my mom has celiac and she’s allergic to yeast just as much as gluten if not more, so you’re not alone
i’m so glad you decided to talk about contraceptives!! i was on the patch for a couple of months but it gave me a rash (yikes) so i went off that, and then in august i got an iud (mirena) and it’s the best/worst thing ever. my hormones haven’t regulated yet so i’ve been getting some of the worst cramps of my life, but my period is pretty much completely gone which was an issue because i have such a heavy blood flow. i’m hoping in another couple months my hormones will be a ok and i won’t have any more pain 👌
i feel like the luckiest girl in terms of periods , i get them about every 3 weeks and they are very light compared to the average from what i can see . the only side effects i get really are a few spots and being generally hungrier/a little more emotional . if i can give any advice to anyone who has horrible periods is excercise and balanced diets as that is something i practice as much as i can ! if i am eating worse and not taking care of myself my periods are noticeably heavier and my mood swings far more severe . \n(not in anyway saying that other periods are caused by a lack of excercise etc but this is just my experience ! 🦋)
I've had really irregular and extremely heavy periods with awful PMS ever since i started getting them. I thought they might even out as i got a bit older but i'm 18 now and went to see the doctor about them before i went to uni to ask if i could be put on a pill. Because I'm gay and not using the pill for contraceptive reasons as well she was really unwilling to give me anything hormonal and instead has put me on tranexamic acid to help with the bleeding. I'm yet to see if this helps but i think there's very little known about non-hormonal pills; if they work then i think they could be a great alternative for people like you who experience hormonal depression on some pills (at least if you don't need the pill for contraception).
Ive never gone on the pill, mostly because i have no abnormal or really bad symptoms (other than i have a pretty heave flow) .
I used to have pretty ridiculous mood swings and low points while menstruating, but since i've start the pill they've kind of evened out. I take Junel Fe and I haven't experienced ANY side effects aside from lighter flow! \nBefore I started the pill, I remember trying to cook an egg on the stove, the yolk proceeded to break while I was cooking it, and i fell to the floor a blubbering mess.
I struggled to take the pill daily so changed to the patch. There was next to no information on it and the doctors were clueless but I have had a good experience on it. My moods are pretty consistent and my PMS is no where near as bad as it was on the pill. Although you can see it in certain places I tend to wear it under my clothes. I would recommend it for someone who struggles to take pills daily as you change it weekly.
I'm allergic to concentrated yeast! It's a thing. Everything is fine except for marmite because of how concentrated it is. It broke me out in hives when I ate it for the first time.
Loved the video I find you so relaxing! I was hoping you could do a 'how cruel is my makeup bag' as you have a large following you can actually make a small difference even if it's just encouraging one person to stop using products tested on animals xx
I reacted so badly to microgynon , so i asked for yasmine and iv never looked back.  I love it and i feel so much more leveled out. This video was awesome thanks for ur honest pill journey story, i was getting really sick of youtubers banging on about how bad the pill is , theres been a huge amount of biased pill shaming , so this has been a welcomed breath of fresh air xxx
Thanks for talking about this topic. I, too, have had similar difficulties with the pill. I finally found the perfect one for me, but it's expensive, but I did find a coupon from the manufacturer that helps with the cost. I wish finding contraceptive wasn't so difficult.
For a while now I'm having a huge problem with PMS. Like  up to a week or so before my period, I start to feel really bad, emotionally. And by really bad, I'm talking suicidal. I do have depression and take anti-depressants for it, but I'm usually fine - unless it's getting close to my period. It's heartbreaking and really, really exhausting. So much so that I actually look forward to my period now because I start to feel better and more stable immediately. I'm not on any birth control, so I don't know if a pill could make this better...
There is quite a controversy growing about the pill in France lately. More and more women stop it because of side effects they don’t want to accept anymore. Consequently there is a controversy about gynecologists because they don’t listen properly to women, etc. I stopped my pill last March, after taking it for 11 years and I feel good. My libido is slowly coming back (which was the main side effect of the pill for me) and I feel less « upset and angry » all the time. I didn’t have any bad side effects. I like the fact that now my mood is way more fluctuant. I spent 10 years having a really « flat » and constant mood. Which could seem nice, but now that I actually experience emotions, I think I was like a robot in some way ^^
my contraception journey: at the age of 19 I went on the implant, I spent a year CONSTANTLY bleeding and I couldn't take it anymore. I then went to the doctors and for some reason (God knows why) the doctor decided to put me on the combination pill whilst I was still on the implant to see if it would stop the bleeding.\nAs someone who suffers with Epilepsy I have to be very careful with what medication I take because it can affect my epilepsy medication and my epilepsy in general. I started to suffer from Aura Migranes (basically if I was looking at anything my vision would flash from normal colour to all pink then all green - the only way I can describe it is like you have got pink and green christmas lights in front of your eyes and they are flashing so all you can see is the intensity of that colour). I went to see my epilepsy specialist and he got so angry at how the GP was so reckless with my condition. He told me to get the implant out and swap the combination pill to progesterone only as the progesterone doesn't affect my medication. so I did this then I spent the next year basically feeling numb, I had no feelings, it was completely flat like nothing mattered. I didn't enjoy anything, I didn't get passionate about anything, nothing affected me. Then I started experiencing pain and bleeding when having sex (obviously my immediate thought went to cervical cancer), so I went to see the doctor, had a smear then got sent to the hospital for a colposcopy. My smear came back normal but there was some abnormality but it was normal. I went to see my nurse (Ive had her for 17 years now) and she suggested coming off the pill altogether as my body might be rejecting all contraception as that can sometimes happen. I did that and the pain and bleeding stopped and it's taken a while but all my smears and colposcopys are coming back as normal. I am now 23, and even though Im relying solely on condoms (not the most effective contraception) I couldn't be happier. My advice to anyone having problems is keep going back, you will eventually get it sorted, don't suffer in silence.
I'm on rigevidon and I've have no problems with it at all. I have been on others in the past and have put weight on very quickly and struggled to shift it. But this hasn't happened with rigevidon and I have been on it for a couple of years
okay so i was in my health class and i was really annoyed and i had really bad cramps. So i like corrected my teacher when she said something wrong and she got really annoyed even though there were other people also making the comments. She then after class talks to me like why the 'fuck you actin' like that so then i'm just like i'm on my period. she then goes on about how periods don't change your mood and i almost slapped her or walked out but i just kinda had to sit there waiting to leave. it was actual hell.
I've never been sure if the awful feelings I had when I was 16/17 Was due to bad mental health, being on the pill, or being a relationship that was going down towards the end of it's run, or a mix of all three. What doesn't help is that after I broke up I decide to just give up taking it and started to feel better and was starting to finish exam stress SO WHO KNOWS MAN SO GLAD TO BE AT UNI WITH A COIL AND WITH A NEW PARTNER NOW
PMS is the worst. I'm currently trying to read up more on herbs to help normalize hormones as I've had some successes in the past (Rosemary Gladstar is a good resource for anyone curious).
What's the pill for ?
this video is so important. I went on the pill (sounds like jasmin from your description but I know it as estelle or brenda) and then roaccutane to deal with my cystic acne. once I finished the roaccutane, maybe a year later, mum suggested I go off the pill and doctor said why not so I did. within a few weeks I felt way more low than I normally do, and unfortunately that fed into my grades for the rest of semester (or was at least a factor). end of last year I went back on the same pill and felt more 'myself'. so weird that that's the case when i'm *on* medication though, and I agree with your dislike of having to depend on it.
I was in a similar situation as your friend where I completely lacked motivation. However I had a blood test done and found I was iron and vitamin D deficient so I'm taking supplements now. My mood has greatly improved thanks to it, so it's not necessarily due to the pill
Thank you for this video! Perfect timing because I have been having serious mood problems and I didn't know why. I did some research and found out it could be my pill... I'm changing brands soon and I really hope my mood will get BETTER! Love you and you look GORGEOUS!
i love this kind of video ! <3
hey thank you for making this video lucy ! it made me realise that i might be in a hormonal depression like you mentioned the pill caused for you, however i've been on depo provera / the injection for about 4 months now and my depression has been absolutely horrible. i got discharged from therapy earlier this year as i was feeling better about my depression but i had to go to back to therapy as i felt depressed again and it was also around the same time i started by birth control !!! so thank u :)
“my womanhood just exploded out of me” this sounds like a line from a bad pornographic novel
My doctor recommended me the Yasmin pill which I was on for about a year, and I found it cleared up my skin really nicely, however, I felt extremely hormonal and volatile in the off couple of days before my period. Because of this, I decided to go off of it and similarly, my skin became awful. It's taken me almost another year and a lot of skincare medication to get it back to the point of where it used to be, and I really wish someone had warned me about the consequences of going off of Yasmin.
for what it's worth, i know someone who is allergic to yeast! so it could be that haha
I've tried \nCopper iud (rejected)\nEstrogen projesten combo pills (had awful hesr attack like symptoms)\nProjesten only pills two different strengths (gave me same side effects combo pills did) \nNuvaring (again same side effects)\nMy partner and I would prefer not to use condoms so we are looking into surgical options as I am in a hetero relationship and don't want kids
Do you think your feeling of ‘craziness’ was because you had a break up, maybe you were dealing with that too?\nBut I 100% agree with the hormonal depression, I was on a pill once where I felt so low, I changed and it was so much better
I'm not sure if I just don't notice my period symptoms anymore or if they're just very mild. My periods are generally quite uneventful--I may be slightly more irritated a bit before, but nothing ever noteworthy. They typically only last three days and the only symptom I've ever noticed is some heavy cramping my first day.
Before you do 23andMe or anything of the sort I would highly recommend doing some research into the fact that they can sell your genetic data to third party companies etc!
I switched from the pill to the implant then finally to the copper coil/IUD and honestly having something hormone free has changed my life. No side affects at all apart from slightly heavier, more painful periods but generally better skin, mood, regular cycles etc. Copper coil all the way!
I'm on the pill which has helped with me getting depressed a week before the week during and the week after so basically i had one week of feeling like me and that sucked however i still have body dysmorphia and i get very emotional and everything is very sensitive which i hate and this period it was bad i hadn't seen my therapist for a week everything was building up and people were being right dick heads this week and what made things worse is that teachers at my school still don't know or even try to know about mental health issues and how to deal with someone having a panic attack non the less my period can do one :(
I'm also having an unusual series of periods. I still haven't got it, but I'm already bloated, I'm super hungry all the time, and I've been feeling depressed for a few weeks. And that's weird cause I never had mood changes before due to my period. I don't understand why this changed. Can your body just change like that even if you haven't done anything different in your lifestyle? As for the pill, I don't feel comfortable taking it, so I just don't :) To me it feels too artificial and I'm not a big fan of hormonal treatments (anyway, that's just what I do myself, of course, I think everyone should take their own decisions on that and that it's ok other people decide to take them).
I was recommended Yasminiq when I was 16 and still take it to this day. I took a pill break from october-november 2016 to february 2017 and I got the WORST CYSTIC ACNE. It just wouldn’t go away and I didn’t want to leave my house because it looked terrible and my face hurt.\nI know a girl in the UK whose doctor told her she should take breaks every three months? But my doctor said that I could just take my pill forever? I don’t know what to believe.
I've been recommended to double pack my pill by many doctors because of my horrendous period pains (endometrosis) never once been told its unsafe.
You'd be surprised by how many people are actually yeast intolerant instead of gluten. It also might be worth seeing if you're intolerant to Malt - as it's in beer, but only some breads and cereals. You could get an intolerance test done from a nutritionist outside of the NHS and it really helps! Saves time with all the trial and errors of eating certain foods each month! :)
Deep shades of lipstick look so good on you compared to just Dabbing on colour
I used to be on a combined pill that needed a 7 day break and it was horrible. The pain was unbearable (cramps) and I became depressed and also very angry. Kept lashing out at my family and then boyfriend. Changed over to the 30 day pill and I'll never look back. I don't have the same problems anymore, rarely any mood swings (my mood levelled out) and it helped calm me down and rarely any pain \nTrust your instincts on this stuff your body will tell you when it doesn't agree with something
I'm 23 and I've always had a really irregular period ever since I can remember. When it came, it wasn't too painful, it was ordinary length and everything, but there were months when it just didn't come. Once when I was maybe 16 or 17, there was an entire year when my period just disappeared, although I'm pretty sure that was due to the death of my brother which occured around that time. Now I finally did go to the doctor and I got a pill, I just started taking it, so I'm really hopeful that it will help me having regular, on-point periods again. If anything, it's really making me more focused and helps me feel a lot better, I've been down lately, but I've been much more balanced since taking it. Fingers crossed it'll work on the long run! :)
I feel like the pill is messing up my hormones or is it my mental health. I really don't know :/
I take Gedarel, as I was taken off Ridgevidon after my face broke out and I had lots of chest pain. It definitely cured the spots but the chest pain has got slightly better but hasn’t gone entirely. However, I’ve noticed that with this pill my mood is lower generally, and my libido/sex drive is non-existent which is very frustrating for my partner. I think I will be going back to the doctors soon to see what can be done.
I have been on Yasmin for 7 years without a break. I have no bad side effects and everything seems normal and manageable (3 day light periods, no pain, no acne, no bloating and minimal PMS). That said - I'm worried I could be hiding my true self! What if I came off the pill one day and no longer loved my husband?! Wondering if I should TRY another pill just to see... or, should I not kill a good thing?
Period day 3 still living just about
My implant is really messing with me, and I should go to the doctors, but I feel like male doctors don't really understand, which puts me off, annoying because my first implant was great
My brother has a yeast intolerance so it's very possible that you could be allergic to that. He also lives in London where yeast alternatives are a lot more available for things like yeast free soy sauce and suchlike :)
I can relate to so many of these pill problems. Taking the pill was just not the right thing for me. I used to get headaches that were out of this world, and it was every time during my pill break (so essentially my period) without fault. I knew that two days after going on a break I couldn't schedule anything with friends because I would be in bed with all the lights out and no sound whatsoever. Now since I am off the pill and using a non-hormonal way for birth control I am so much happier. I can't recommend it enough to try and go without hormonal birth-control for a while, it's so much better for your body and your mind (I used to be an emotional mess whilst on the pill, now I'm totally fine)!
See im on Microgynon and have been for over a year and it really agrees with me so far compared to the 3 others ive been on. But i really wanna come off and try the contraceptive app, but my partner doesnt like condoms. EH. LIFE OF A WOMAN.
every time i watch her videos i feel so peaceful inside <3
You do make me consider going to the doctors to try another pill... Even if its just to see what it would do to me Hahaha
I mean your aesthetic is just goals
The food thing may also be fermented foods? All GI doctors get you to do the FODMAP diet, I'm sure you've heard of it. Maybe talk to your doctor about giving that a go? Kombucha is also fermented fruits and stuff hence why I suggested the FODMAP diet. It helps narrow down which food group it is x
a book i read about nutrition told me to find out for myself what i'm intolerant to and how differents food affect my body (cutting stuff out, trying new foods, etc) it's a looong road but i'm willing to try it 🙌🏻
Also, I couldn't recommend enough picking up the book A Mind of your Own by Kelly Brogan. At least look her up on facebook or on her website
This video came at the right time! I have really heavy, really painful, super irregular period and I've been trying to research what kind of pill would help me. The thing is, my mom is against it. It's already been more than five years since my first period (it'll be six in April) and they've been getting progressively worse. This last period, I woke up twice at night because of the pain. And I was on a heating pad! I've been having to take two Aleve and an ibuprofen in the morning, then another ibuprofen at lunch or when I get home. I'm just tired of my super heavy periods and want some relief.
I'm having a very similar experience right now! I've been on rigevidon for about 8 months now, but starting in May, I began to have anxiety attacks about once every 2 weeks or so, normally in the evenings. Recently they've been happening way more often, and this period it's happened three days in a row. I know that rigevidon has caused similar anxiety symptoms in a lot of other women so I'm thinking of swapping to a lower oestrogen pill!
This was lovely to watch, especially as I'm on my period too! You're the only person I know of who has tried Cilest, it was the first pill I tried and I was on it for 3 years and the only reason I stopped was because it stopped effecting my periods and I just had irregular periods anytime instead of during my week break. I then went on Cerazette I think (mini pill) and I was on it for 2 weeks and it made me suicidal so I came off it and my GP was horrible about it but this was the same GP who didn't believe me when I came to her for help with anxiety and depression. I went on another combined pill for a while and then ended up back on Cilest and eventually on a cheaper version of it at the moment! I get awful PMS too I hate myself on my period. I get so forgetful, very irritable and impatient but also mega tired and I either want to eat everything or nothing. I can't believe some of the things doctors have said about the pill, taking two pills at once sounds mental! \nI take my pill 2 months at a time and then I have a week break because during the week break I get bad migraines and my mental health gets really bad so I try to avoid having a period every month and doctors have said it's okay to do it the way I'm doing it. I love watching videos about this stuff, I love talking about contraception and sexual health because it's a personal thing that I don't tend to discuss as most of my friends are on the implant and all tell me I should get it but no thank you 😂
I have a hormone imbalance. Probably have pcos due to most of the woman in my mums side having it. I started at 11. It was irregular, fairly light but very bad cramps. I have ibs so that interfered. After a year my period got heavier, began my descent into anxiety and depression, cramps got worse, acne EVERYWHERE other than my face lol. Gained an obscene amount of weight. I left my school and moved to a much better one. Two kinds of pills later I’m on sertraline and an anti acid with no pill. My periods are back and batter ish. I used to have them for 2weeks to 8weeks and now they’re exactly 7 days and only very very heavy for 2days. Zelest was great as it removed my periods completely but due to gaining weight I couldn’t take it. I went on the single hormone which really didn’t work. Bit babbly but you get the picture. Much happier now, still fighting my weight but I’ll get there. Ly girl - starting conversations from day one xxx
i read a historic book and suddenly started to cry...yeah hormons are great
I swear A LOT on my period and I'm so emotional
I love these type of videos.
I don’t understand why you put so much god damn emphasis??? on using cruelty free make up but you still but from shops like H&M? Like??? Why don’t you care about your clothes being cruelty free? I don’t... understand??
I’m on the pill Marvelon to help my skin and my period pain and my skin is incredible, I went from having acne to completely clear skin but my period pain is awful.. I accidentally doubled a pill this month when I was hungover (no idea why) and I’ve started my period early, usually I start on exactly the same day on my break week, but I am in agonyyyy, I need a pill that fixes my skin and my pain🤦🏼‍♀️ loved this video! X
About the food/diet thing, I'm suffering with IBS, which involves things such as bloating and feeling sick after eating. (Relatable to your symptoms)\nAt the moment I'm doing a diet called the Fodmap diet which is of course meant to help with the symptoms but the main goal is to find out what food triggers you by trying several categories of foods and keeping a diary. I've only started a couple of days ago, so I'm still very new at this but I thought of the diet immediately when you mentioned the foods that might or might not trigger you. It might not be useful for you at all but it is worth to google :)
I have never used a hormonal pill however I do take a herbal supplement which has been LIFE CHANGING! I used to get the most intense cramps, back and leg pain as well as severe nausea and fainting episodes, every month! I had tried anti nausea pills from the doctor but they weren't always effective and did nothing for my mood swings and menstrual cramps. I visited a homeopathic clinic and ended up starting on 'agnus castus', a herbal supplement which balances my hormones throughout the month. It basically stops the huge build up of hormones on the first day of my period which was causing my body to go a bit mental! This literally cured me and if I remember to take my supplements everyday I can have almost no symptoms whatsoever - even less painful symptoms like breast tenderness has almost diminished! I know it sounds hippie and alternative and unlikely to work, but I have found the natural way far more effective than anything I have ever been prescribed. Homeopathy treats the underlying condition whereas, in this case with my periods, conventional medicine was just trying to treat the symptoms. I am now in the position where the symptoms do not occur. The only down side is you do have to pay for it however my supplements are about £9 a bottle and I only use up about 3 per year so it's a small cost for the amazing benefits I receive. I really cannot recommend it enough!
Love ❤️ your videos!
you seem like helena bonham carter
Youre hair!' 😍
microgynon fked me up
Mmmm another GRWM? Feed me I need more Lucy
shit.
It might be barley
girl theres gluten in beer
Why the fuck are feminists so obsessed with menstruation?
The first pill i was put on made me bleed constantly (which was ironic since it makes a lot of women's periods stop completely). I didn't realise for a while that it was also making me slightly depressed. Once i was changed onto a different pill i felt so much better, i can't even describe it. My periods are still a tad irregular but they're getting there

菅田くん、俳優から歌手デビューっていう先入観が邪魔して素直に聴けなかったけど、本当に声とか歌い方とか魅力的で好き
私の知ってる菅田将暉は電王だった…  時代進むの早いなぁ 米津さんとコラボってすごい…  どっちもすごい人同士だから本当にすごい
I LOVE THIS SONG !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nfrom Vietnam
ブランコに乗ってる時、米津玄師の方は歌では思いっきり歌っているのに口パクはおとなしめ、菅田将暉は思いっきり歌ってるのをちゃんと表現してる、そこが気になりました\n初見ですがやっぱり米津玄師はいいですね、好きです 😊

1.2回聴いてすぐ歌えるようになった\n米津さんが書く歌は分かりやすいけど、深いくて、誰にも書けない。\n彼の才能は素晴らしい。

Let’s try to get this video more dislikes than likes
He thinks they have food.  Someone from a car has been feeding him.
I gotta stop reading the comments on animal videos. The comments go stupidly soft regarding animals. And then watch a video of people, and comments go stupidly vulgar and vicious.
It sure is a pretty animal.
He was just trying to tell you that you left your diaper bag on the roof
Oh he's chasing honey. Oh he chasing
for some reason this video really angered me. has me thinking that this is a wolf dog and someone has discarded it. i think it was begging for help.
Looked small for a wolf and more like someones Husky.
Lol at them listening to Say my Name by Destiny’s Child
Wolf= reincarnated mother in law
i think that is a siberian husky they just abandoned there haha
actually a werewolf about to turn back into a human, didnt want to walk home.
That is a Siberian Husky.
That was clearly a pet. Hopefully it wasn't theirs smh
Maybe they had a another dog and it passed away and came back as a wolf and he saw his family and tried to catch up to them :(
Thats actually a husky that wants to go home
@ViralHog that is clearly i sibberan husky i do not feel bad for you i feel bad for the dog. he was clearly lost. this is just mean to the dog.
Lemme ride in the passenger seat with the window rolled down!!!  Please!  I wanna see what it feels like!
Looks more like a husky to me
Are they sure it wasn't a Husky?  It kinda looks like a dog not a wolf
Just drove your fucking car off and try not to lure it to you.
people have probably fed him before thats why he's running after cars he expects food
He most likely want to change their minds about global warming climate change. It’s a hoax he wanted to say.
The resson why he followd the car bc he wanted water bc the gery wolf is hungry and thisty
That is not wild animal...\nIt is someones pat...
It's your dog right ? Pretty sick.
You must stop vehicle, I would.....
Such a great video, you have a great channel
My snack is running away!
He's got your plate number, so it's not over..
That's a dog wanting those idiots to take it home with them ..
He just wants a ride  !
It’s probably dead by now... just saying
GOD HELP ME! I'm so tired of ppl being so overly sensitive when it comes to animals. Some of the same ppl that treat each other like crap😒
More like you drove in front of the wolf...
That's so fucked.. Don't toy with the animal. To be honest that looks more like a dog to me than a wolf, but I'm no expert on wolfs so I'm probably wrong.
It's not a pet.you are food.
Did you ever get rid of him/her
It was probably a line wolf thinking it had a huge kill
Why didn't you let him catch the car to see what he would do?
You should have stopped. Not like it's going to rip the doors off the car. It might have been someone's pet, and just wanted a ride.
Oh you idiots. Thats rowly. He is a very well known wild but friendly wolf. I remember the area in the video. Its in canada. Me an some friends heard of rowly an we went to find him an meet him. He is a super kool wolfie. An he loves deer jerky.
That wolf was tryna listen to Beyoncé on the radio
It may have been a pet. Please stop and check on it.
Wolf:  *There's a killer in the backseat! I repeat, there is a killer in the backseat!*\n\nAww, he's chasing us
Why would you not give him some food?
I would probably have thought that it was a lost dog and in a effort to help him I'd be immediately devoured.  😂
Idk o dont think thats a wild animal and if it isn't thats kinda fucked up if it's been left out there
Yep they just totally failed to help someone's lost pet.
Hes Hungry and someone has thrown food to him in the past from a car. Hes so hungry hes hoping for a handout.
How did a Wolf get in a car?
Beautiful animal.. he was probably hungry and trying to score some handouts from you.  Lone wolves don't have an easy time out there.
lol they listening to 'say my name'
They should've stoped. He may have been asking for help.
Aww that's cute but scary at the same time...
Awe! He looks like he wanted to play!
Whoa! That is cool, but one question: why was the wolf chasing the car?
Why wouldn't you stop for it? It clearly wasn't hostile, and as long as you kept your doors shut you would have been safe!
What if came there to ask for help cause offtenly many wild animals ask help to human by following
That's not a wolf. Wolves have long legs.
That is not a wild wolf. A wild wolf will not get near people. That is a pet chasing his family. This is a screwed up video. I own a 95% Wolf Dog. He is my second wolf dog. I have had these animals for over 20 years and was raised in the country around wild wolves. I call total BS on this video!!! I hope this is not a pet being dumped. If the wolf dog was done this way to make a video then the owners should be ashamed of themselves. Also the wolf dog could have been hit by another car.
😓 It didn't occur to you to stop the car, crack the window, and give a quick whistle or pucker to check the reaction of the animal? If it came up to you car willingly with a friendly approach, it may have been someone's lost pet. This looks like a Malamute, without a doubt. Way too road friendly and even the way it runs is slightly more domesticated than the run of a wild wolf.
Probably has rabies it's a wolf people come down cold be mixed with coyote
He looks so addorable, why dont you get off and pet him
I would have pulled over and pet him
That looks like a beautiful husky mix.  Must be lost.  I would have stopped to see if it came whimpering up to the window wagging it's tail like a lost dog before giving it that kind of chase, and on a desolate highway! How stupid. Could have caused a major accident
wtf is wrong with this family
Why are they not just driving off he could get hit by truck!
i think people have fed that before not the people making the video but someone who might have seen the wolf on the side of the road and thrown food out the window to him
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂that wolf almost got them😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Reincarnated lost relative
Agree it must have been someone's pet! Unrealistic demeanor for wild animal.
Thats a husky, definitely not a wolf.
That is so wered
THATS NOT A WOLF OMG
Nice Husky:)
He smelled children
dog
Wolfie!!! 😍😍😍😍

Aww
Wow
heart breaking
Thats really sad

Poor dog
Oh My Goodness 😍🐺❤️
Such a majestic boy
You and your family do have my sympathy for having to deal with all these crude, evil and generally stupid people in your comment section. Anyone expecting any of you to exit the vehicle and approach a wild, potentially dangerous animal is frankly just insane. I, unlike everyone else it seems, read the full description of the video and know that there was no service in your area at the time to calling the park service or anyone else for that matter to try and aid the _possibly_ lost animal. There was nothing you could have done save for just driving away quickly. True, I suppose you could have tried to get the attention of a passing driver for help but honestly, what could they have done either? Not many people would be willing to drop everything they are doing to assist strangers who are trying to assist a wolf/dog without knowing what its intentions really are. And believe me when I say *nobody* knows what this animal really wanted. There are a dozen reasons why it could look happy, wagging its tail and chasing your car. Even if you put it in your car what assurance would you have had that it would not simply attack?
Chciał być adoptowany! | He wanted to be adopted!
this is not a grey wolf this is someknes let dog bops!!! and she's desperately still looking for him
Is that Bigfoot at 1:01 mark?
poor wolf dog it probably want some love and attention
Party details in the description! Hope to see you there!\nAlso, the #MakeMusicEverywhere merch is only on sale for one more week! http://merch.andrewhuang.com
I love series where you just finish songs! It is inspiring to see that you CAN come back and FINISH
You are so right. I suck at finishing.
Thank you Andrew! You inspire me with every Single Video!
I don't know if you ever take music suggestions from the comments but you should make some tayste djent metal songs.
100%. This is the truth.
I'm gonna make a video where I finish all my unfinished projects, and finally break the unfinished projects curse I have!\nAnd not a single word was heard about that video ever again.
We need to give Andrew a Masterclass.
Thank you so much for this advice - you are a constant inspiration! :)
Hm, I would have thought it was don't compare yourself to others
The song is so damn good I at the showing tonight and it was amazing!!!!!!!!
YOU MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY I ALMOST DROPPED MY BASS 2:56
It is SO true! Every time I start a project I find myself struggling to just finish it. I find that I fall in love with my ideas and it's so hard to create them without them being perfect, but the truth is... There is no perfect, only finished. I always have to remind myself of that but it's so true.\n\nOh, water is true too. #820hydrate
May 2009 was a month before you finished the extended NEVER (also the same month you put out BIRD SONG)
Of all times you host a meetup it's on my final exam :(
Damn I hate the new sound that plays when you upvote a comment
You are ridiculously productive.\nConsidering you put a music track and a video out in 3 days and considering the quality of the content this comes off as, well, insane.
I found this to be really inspiring, so thank you so much for making this video!\nAlso, I was just wondering: how do you distribute your music? And if you do it personally: which website do you use (and why)?
That's true. I never finish anything!!
aw mannnn, I wish I could go to the 1 million subscriber party tomorrow because I'm like 3 hours away in Ontario but I don't drive and I have college :c
Once you see his eyebrows, you won’t be able to stop noticing them
These are some great tips! I've just started out with this whole music production thing, and I would highly appreciate it if you guys could give me feedback on my music: https://soundcloud.com/user-886261717  Keep making amazing stuff!
What next I finished watching the video???
Can someone tell me what time the party is
I like how the title looks like click bait, but it isn't
*looks at folder of unfinished projects*
There is no perfect, there is only finished.\n    -Andrew Huang 2017\n\nWords to live by.
I have a great voice
May 6th! That's my birthday! :D 3:02
Why Andrew? Why?! Why did you not emulsify your vinaigrette?
I am Finnish, thus I am complete.
Hey Andrew, you should try and make a song using different sounds from Doctor Who, just thought it would be cool.
that last song is quite beautiful. i agree with what you said about finishing projects. even though every work can be made better, at some point you want to share it with people. so you must decide what is more important to you, perfecting it, or getting it out there. i believe the whole point of creating something is to share ideas & connect with others.
*@ANDREW HUANG*\nGet a large and well isolated thermos and your ice water will last for hours and you don't need to go to the kitchen to refill it ;)
Help, I'm too good at starting!\nAll I ever do is start. I don't think I've finished anything..
So very true! Remember not to get caught up in the 'perfection' and move on to the next project.

Hey Andrew, when will you finally visit Marti Fischer?
lmao i dont finish any of my art =(
Cannot love this video enough. I've been hearing this finish your shit message everywhere i look lately. Something tells me i should finish my shit
When you use the Push, how do you stay in key? Is it harder or easier than using a midi keyboard?
You hit one million
I didn't think I needed this but I did. Thank you.
Song challenge: play Foreigner's cold as ice with ice cubes
you should collab with Sharpe he makes beats too
Yessss - that was so GOOD brother, that last song had me in chills.
Honestly, thanks so much for saying this. I'm not a musician but i do 3d animation and models and stuff and a good majority of all the time i put into it result in unfinished projects that i'm not happy with and continue to put off saying i'll finish or fix it later but I never do.I'm glad you said something about it. Thanks
Finishing music is not easy to do
Is hard to see... 'cause it's glass.
There is no perfect, only finished. I'm taping this to my ceiling so I can stare at it when I go to bed and go to sleep.
Song Challenge: Elevator music. Make music with only the sounds from an elevator, either where you live or in a big city the next time you visit one. Bonus challenge: You can't make any of the sounds intentionally. Just ride an elevator a bunch of times recording all the sounds it makes, and the people inside. !!!
I mean I know you have 1+ mil subs but bro you deserve so many more
Did anyone actually win the million subs giveaway ? .. not me :( \n#ineverwinanything
That last song sounds so much like Coldplay I love it!!
it's hard to see because it's glass. i like this!
https://youtu.be/TkObLEgXnIU — that`s Andrew`s video from this february, that was recomended to me by youtube. Both this and that one are working both ways as prequel/sequel to each other being 9 mounths apart. Nice way to finish, keep it up.
i really like your setup! its so aesthetic
6:13 when it’ll get released?
This whole video is about the exact reason why I started my channel.
bro this video has a whole second sexual meaning
I just realized that I follow you because I envy you :l
This definitely isn't even restricted to art. It partially applies to the programming projects I do too, except finishing them takes more time.
Ive only realised this now after watching him for a year that has he ever had a voice drop?
How about a song like the intro to American Horror Story? Embrace the spooky season
And to find out what this one thing is, \n\nYou just have to buy my new book
Art is never finished, only abandoned.\n                                    Leonardo da Vinci
Thank-you for this video, Andrew. It's something I am trying to make myself understand as well as my friends too.  Keep up the inspirational videos!
Finishing is all about making decisions. And decisions are often hard.
Don't trust a perfect person, and don't trust a song that's flawless |-/
... You're everything i need XD Also, that last song was... So good.
Like the Mona Lisa's eyebrows??????
Andrew can you make music with a midi fighterlike Shawn Wasabi?
I'm a new artist and I have like 25 different song ideas on my computer and not one of them is finished. It's just so hard!
Your tracks are really dope. Very unique
I wish I could have been there😭 all the best for your Friday the 13 celebration!!!!
Your shorts doe

People calling all people \nI’m GAY as FUCK
Why MUST someone come out as non straight?
This video couldn't be more perfect for me right now!! Thank you Hannah because I need this shit😁xx
You are awesome Hannah, thanks for the vid!
My hair is as straight as I am.
I need Hannah Hart to be my best friend.
No ad...demonetized. Poor Hannah. Thank you for keeping on and staying positive.
Have you researched PMDD? It sounds like you might be dealing with that. I hope it gets easier!
I came out to my best friend the day this video was uploaded!!!
💟💟💟 all the love to you, Hannah
Coming out with something?  I can come out as being lazy.  But everyone knows this already.  I don't even have to mention it.  Also i don't think it's a fight I'm having with something I can't help.  I agree it's probably one of those your choices define who you are, rather than your choices are made for you by who you are.  I could be wrong though.  Maybe I got something wrong with me where I know I should go to the store and buy something to make a healthy meal, but instead, would rather order a pizza and watch Hannah Hart videos all day.
My fiance just came out to me 7 months ago that he now she is trans and I couldn't be happier for us I knew there was a reason why I always more attracted to women and it's like it was always ment to be but I'd love her no matter what sex she wanted to be it's been rough but we have good days and bad days and in the end as long as we love each other that's all that matters
Yesss thank you Hannah! I actually came out about how I hate my job on coming out day! How timely and sage your advice is 😊
It has took a day to watch this cause my mam dosent know😂😂
Currently in a depressive rut and was proud, because I just finished my shower after not showering for...some number of days :) Thanks for the pep talk!
It is hard...but totally worth it. I’m getting married this weekend...and 180 people are coming to celebrate us! That is amazing. We are so loved...and the struggle was real.
National coming out day 😂😂 fuck sake. This world is so stupid
Wow, I have over the years began to realize a pattern in my moods too. It is an annual shift around September or October, and I used to push everyboby and everything away from me. It would last months, and I was a super depressed meany. I am not as bad now, I acknowledge it and accept I am feeling this way. Then I fight like crazy to not be so mean and moody. It has been about 10 years now. I still get this way every year, till about New Year. I let people close to me know. Hang in there. It is not all bad. hehehe👍🌈
Hannah Hart I just love you! You're so awesome and always bring me joy when I watch your videos! That's all I want to say :) <3 Happy coming out day to you! :)
*come for the Hannah*\n*stay for the more Hannah*
I'm gay
Depression is an everyday all day thing for me. XD
Yesterday I came out to my mother as bi. I've only been out online and accidentally to my brother so I was REALLY scared to come out to her. I've been planning this forever and it still took so much effort but I did it! She was really accepting of me, she told me she loved me and gave me a hug. It was great!!
Your video soundtrack didn't
if you’re out to some people but not everyone, can you still be considered “out”?
❤you Hannah. Also why you bruise your lips crazy lady😭
Unfortunately there will always be small mi did people.
I'm sorry that you're blue (emotionally and physically),  I am so impressed that you managed this video when I have those days I struggle to say my own name.
I love that you're in tune to what your cycle does to your mental health...I need to figure mine out. Can anyone tell me the app she uses to track her cycle? I know she said it in a different video.
I wore my straight outta the closet shirt and I wore it to church and I got kicked out of church and was told I was sick
Man I wish I could....maybe one day.
Thank you so so much for eveything and being the wonderful person you are and share it! Go you !! 💞💞💞💞
I hope your downswing eases soon.  Lots of love from another Bisexual ADHD Hannah <3
I appreciate that you are transparent in sharing your true self with the world. Depression and Sexuality are very powerful topics. Thank you for sharing.
I'm trying to get my sister alone to tell her I'm gay. This is terrifying.
hey Hannah~ I love your message and the content you put out! I would love to collaborate with you on my podcast on my website @ beyoubeproud.org
You know, I roll out of bed in the morning, and take a walk in a local park before I can really think about how bad I feel. I shower when I get back. So, go take that walk, and worry about cleaning up later. It really does help.
Thank you for keepin it real!
May everything in your life be covered in rainbows and joyThanks Hannah xxxx
Love is a journey - i'm stealing that.
I've heard some people put it as 'Sometimes it doesn't get better, it gets different'
Hannah- thank you for making and putting up this video even when you weren’t feeling well.  That is a truly unselfish gift.  Sending get well hugs and hope that you feel better soon!!  😊
Came out to my dad today! I was realy strest out obout it but he responded amazingly
I identify with something Shane Dawson once said: Life doesn´t get better, what get´s better is your tollerance for bullshit.
Thanks for this video, Hannah! So sweet and so true. <3\nBy the way, that is a really great idea to tell your friends to ask you specific questions. I might have to use that too!
I'm bi but I'm in a serious relationship with a man. Do you think I should come out to my parents? Does it matter?\nLike if they know my bf and I don't ever date a girl why do they need to know who I've had sex with?
My therapist told me one time, “no one is ever done growing and learning. No one is a chicken you bake in the oven and it’s done and  cooked.”
Hi I had a questions and would really look forward to hear your opinion everyone.

YjtRY28Pe2o,Is it even good to have a day named after a group of people that share the same (quality, idea, belief, or sexuality)?

YjtRY28Pe2o,For example, I am not black but I feel like it is offensive to have something called Black History Month. I am an Atheist, but I would never want a day to be called International Atheist Day. I feel like that it creates more division instead of bringing people together, because you are excluding a group of people and say ok here is 1 day (week or month), this is yours and you can do whatever you want but after this you have to shut up about it.

YjtRY28Pe2o,But also I have heard from my friend that it is very different with sexualty since it is even hard for the person to figure it out and accept it and it makes it feel better to have that day and celebrate.

YjtRY28Pe2o,If you disagree with me I would like to hear your argument and also I want a day for these things, Asian middle eastern day, Gamer day, cyclist day, not much of a drinker day, believe in parallel universe day, AI enthusiast's day, not radio listener day, etc.
Opps, didn't know there was a national coming out day. \n\nI came out a week ago in my 23rd birthday 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
I appreciate the comments about anxiety and depression, Hannah. Walks are good and depression is rough.. and it just so happened to be on my birthday. 😂😅😅
You're right hannah. Love IS crazy! Feel better soon.
Yes, it does get better! And then worse, lol. Yes...that's life! \nAnd hey - I had the lowest day of my cycle yesterday too.
thankyou for this you are such an inspiration to girls and the broader lgbtq+ community. i love you so veyr much and look up to you so much <3 <3
I didn't even know it was national coming out day, but I came out to my mom as bi!
Love you Hannah, I appreciate your honesty and openness.
Remember: It's better to be hated for WHO I AM rather than loved for what I AM NOT. YOU GUYS ARE LOVED! ❤️❤️❤️
I am a gay man (he/him) and you are so f-ing beautiful in everyway Hannah Hart. *You are love,* that's what you are. *<3*
Was gonna post my story. Got too distracted by Hannah's t-shirt and the hilarious Paddy's related memories it brings...
Hope you had a great National Coming Out day and yes, I believe that it always get better. Even if life can be hard at times, everything will always get better since giving up is not an option as we work through the worst, not losing hope and remain strong each time, just like on how we LGBTQ community keep on fighting for our rights and acceptance and those with mental health issues coming to terms with it and work on coping with it or at the very least, we focus on the positive and what makes us happy to make with help from our loved ones us feel better :)
This has really made me feel alot better about coming out to my nan thank you keep up with the good videos!!!
Well, I am a straight guy and I would date you in a hartbeat. Sorry for the pun ;D\n\nIn all honesty. You are one of the most genuine youtubers and I love the fact that you use this platform for important stuff like this!
You’re adorable, thank you for being you all of the time. It makes those of use who haven’t been ourselves want to be stronger. ❤️
You're right, Hannah, it does get better ... and sometimes worse ... and then better. Mostly better. I have been blessed that my coming out experiences have been primarily positive. Fortunately, I live in a supportive community and surround myself with positive people. To all the young gays out there ... try to find positive, supporting people and, to the extent possible, minimize the negative people in your life. As Hannah says, coming out is a journey, not a destination!
I feel you boo. I've also been depressed AF today. Made myself leave my house. I went to the Ocean after dark, walked on the beach and cried. Felt much better after, but still down.
it doesnt necessarily get BETTER so much as it gets... easier. handling the curveballs life throws at you gets easier with each experience.
SAME, every month I have to fight the urge to eat all the fats and carbs I can reach haha it does get worse before it gets better :)
Two inspirational videos by MyHarto and IISuperwomanII 😂\nHappy Day of the Girl and Happy Coming Out day!!
i'm so proud of myself as yesterday i came out to everybody at school and now im happy with myself because everyone was so supportive 😊
Love yourharto!  I feel like I need to take a wall at my house and do a giant graph. Maybe my downswings will be on a cycle as well?  Hmm
I battle anxiety, I hate my job. Wait, I whine about that every day on the social network so I guess I'm already out on that.
Right there on that peak low with ya
Cishet ally and parent here if anyone needs to talk ☺
Love  you!  You are beautiful and insightful and funny and kind.   I hope you feel chipper again very soon.  Walk and shower; great ways to perk up. ♥
Thanks Hannah... I really needed this today <3  When misery loves company! Yay for company!! ^_^;;
I love how real this video is.. this is what our kids/adults who are struggling need to hear. Not a fantasy story that they won’t even buy anyway... they need need the truth. This is encouraging for many reasons, but most importantly it reminds us that we are not alone or weird or weak for feeling how we are feeling and that even successful people like you experience ups and downs. Thank you for being vulnerable and honest with us. Sending love!!
I don't normally comment on videos but I am now. My 12yr old niece came out to me today. She told me that she's been planning on coming out today since June of this year. I am so incredibly proud of her. I love how open and honest she is. My sister, her mother, did not have the same reaction. Which, honestly, surprised me. I love me niece and support her no matter what. But my sister is my best friend and while I know she's most likely just scared and confused I don't know what to do. Any advice would help. Thank you.
Straight white dude here. Came out about developing PTSD while I was deployed. I have never been better.\n\nI'm so glad that you have such a public voice to spread such positive vibes.\n\nAlso, to anyone that struggles with coming out thinking that your straight friends would care,  well... A real friend doesn't care. \n\nAlso Hannah leave the house. Or drink. Or fuck it, both.  :-)
Ok,so I think that I might be gay or bi or sth I don't know,and I started thinking about it about 3 years ago and I was in denial until a few months ago, and all of this started weirdly,like not like most people start questioning,and I'm like what if I'm wrong and only 1-2 people know,but some of my closest friends do not and I'm trying to decide whether to tell them,even if I haven't figured it out,or not
It's not going to get 100% better, 100% of the time. Very true!
is your monthly depression somehow linked to your pms like mine? coz god I get so deeply depressed every month around that time, its just makes my regular depression worse for a few days, it just feels terrible..
I hope it does get better, and that one day I can be proud of who I am.
Hannah.  You are very wise.  Yes.  Coming out is extremely important, whatever you are coming from/ are/ want/ long/ need to be.  Take care, love.
I agree with everything you said in this video. Per the monthly cycle of emotional flux: it’s important to note the full moon can be used to clear extra baggage. While New moon will assist in attracting your desires...
I needed this today ❤️😊
Coming out is a journey, not a destination. Exactly right Ms. Hart. Some days there's little traffic and clear highways, some days it's gridlock, once in a while you have a flat tire. But keep going, and reach out to someone if you find you need a navigator.\nFind yourself thinking about giving it up? Don't. Just keep driving. Better is just up the road a bit.
Thank you Hannah! Love you and as always, take care of your self!
Hey Hannah I know you wont read this but ill try anyway. My ex was bipolar so I know patterns of emotional highs and lows pretty well. I'm not saying that you are bipolar but I am saying that if you see a pattern in your emotion then maybe talk to someone that can help you know? Especially if everything in your life is going well. IF there is an imbalance in your body then it helps to have a professional to talk to about it or even take medicine if it is necessary (not that medicine should ever be a first choice). But anyway I hope you feel better hun.
I love you, Hannah. Keeping it really real. I'm shi**y, I'm fine, today sucks, what a great day, I'm super depressed, wow I just had a fantastic idea!, I barely got out of bed, making this video is important to me, if you feel shi**y talk to someone, good Lord today sucks, have a great day everyone!!!\n\nI just love ya so much! You're just fantastic!\n\nKeep up and you will be kept up~ Yogi Bhajan\n💛
Thank you,  it is nice to hear that.  Twice in past year I have been cornered by family trying to force me to come out to them. I only within this year have really come to terms with myself and the label queer (I think I identify as Asexual maybe Demisexual, but talking to people in the past about it didn't go well for me). But, it is still good to hear encouragement.
I am feeling depressed today because Joey Graceffa couldn't make it to Colorado. :( Thank you Hannah, you always make my day :)
4 years ago after Hannah posted a video on National Coming Out Day I wrote I think I might like girls. into my diary...and I was totally right, still super gay!
❤️
Yay rainbows!!
I love thiis giirl!
We love you, Hannah!
Hang in there ! :D
The commentators are random af 😂
“I spoke to soon”😂😂😂😂
Well KSI was right it's HESKY TIME HAHAHA!!!
Ha JJ and joe were on the same team
Does the commentator not realise that music is normally played when a goal is scored at wembley...?
How my day goes first\n\n\nRead More
Well in Stevie I LOVE LIVERPOOL
Spencer your rubbish
I actually like Robbie savage
The atmosphere👀
Steve g
Jezza , Garnier and Gerrard were probably the best here! Great play! But Good Luck Next Time
On the bench, Theo Barker! Not Baker, Barker. :D
OMG HESKEY AND KSI ON THE SAME TEAM XD HESKEY HATES KSI THOUGH
Hugh Whizzy is crap
The commentating was painful to listen to.
When harry threw the ball to the keeper isn’t that a pass back?
No sound...
2018 Barcelona fc vs hashtag united
Tekkers kid went to this
I t h o u g h t    T e k k e r z  to w n  w e r  e g o i n g   Win
For anybody saying they could NOT see Tekkers Towns defense then Liverpools defense doesnt exist.😂
Next year the legend is Theo Heiny
Hugh was seriously a let down
comment who u think got man of the match i go for w2s
I thought there would be more skills... oh well
tekkers biggest mistake: having Gerrard on the team. they just put bad luck on themselves
If billy was playing they would have won
TEKKERS TOWN!
Good game lads...Robbie savage is sooo entertaining to watch, gotta love him. Best quote of the day regarding one of the keepers, he should be playing for Donald Trump coz he's a wall.   LOL
Who else remember the first ever Wembley cup😂😂😂😂
Why didn't Joe Waller play? Is he hurt too?
Weller didn't even play... Why did he take his top off?
steven gerrard says next year??? mate this is not liverpool chasing the premier league lol
If billy wingrove played earlier he would have knocked in at least 4
The commentators just hate each other don’t they 😂😂😂
6-1 are you mad mate
I think they should host one of the games here in Houston Texas
Gerrard is the man of the match
It is boring when spencer fc/hashtag united always win like if you agree😊😊😊
I hope tekker town win
I went to the Wembley cup
I was there
(._.)\n<,︻╦╤─ \n_/﹋\_███████ ]▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▃\n▂▄▅█████████▅▄▃▂  bbbooooommm
Stuart Pearce losing a game as a manager? Where have we seen this before...
What's the song called  when the commentary said that ksi intressed
Tekkers was so op but still got destroyed
If billy was on for Cutting, Tekkers prolly could have won or tied
Hope ksi don't make a disstrac about tekkers city
This is unfair: you take a team that has already play a lot of games togheter and that is really fit and then a team that has never played togheter and are really unfit and then play against each other. of course the fit team is going to win and if you think that legends will help then no ok some of them were fit still but many of them were not so the legends will also not really help. Plus you obviously need a professional coach and do some training because everyone got tackled who ever got the ball and when some one was open no one else opened up so it was very hard to pass it is just un fair it is the same as real madrid and tekkers town played togheter un fair also the others from hashtag who were off camera during the challenges were obviously training togheter
Why does lynch never use his skill
Hashtag only won because billy was injured
commentary was on another level! hope you guys do it also next year! thanks for the laughs! oh, and the game was ok too
Anyone can tell me the score so I don’t have to watch the whole thing
Hi everyone can you check out my little boys football channel if you like subscribe thank you
Did joe Weller come on?
Gerrard never nasty...just stamped on Herrera that one time after being on the pitch for 1 min ;)
kieran brown really bad on the pitch should stay with his tricks and freestyle
does anybody else get annoyed by geordie sometimes? something about him idek.
David James just isn't a legend, always been shot and still is now hahaha
I mean gerrard
Crappy defensive side for tekkers. Absolutely no chemistry and fitness for tekkers. This isn’t right 😡😡😡
why cant the amazing freestylers like daniel cutting and sian garnier and jezza just dribble through the whole team and score like they do in their videos
+F2Freestylers - Ultimate Soccer so funny when there was a pen for jezza and he was so serious when he scored but then he was like, this is just my job
Crawford sucks
Please do a Highlights video like last year.
david JAMES as they call him in spain lmao lawrence u dumbass lol haha funny mfkrs
Just finished highschool but already makes more money then you
If tekkers town had a single legend in defence this game would've been very different.
They speld Baker wrong
Gerrard ❤
Hashtag united sucks
Heskey time
chrismd :/
w2s world class back
How much did Spencer pay the F2???
My Bad 14.34
Yes hashtag
There both Sunday leeeeagueee
Houst, Tx
I miss this!!!! Noo
Hashtag should sign jeremy lynch and billy wingrove
Wingrove?
Theo Barker hahehe lol
Did
F**k this game
Man True Geordie and Lawrence are to much!!😂😂😂
Anyone know the song that was played when they scored
What's the goal song called?
Who saw Jimmy Conrad pointing where jeremy was going when he was taking the penalty
Pollock is quality
Aids :/
slaughter
Theo Barker??
Tekers guru
Spencer FC
lajk ako si balkanac
Heskey time
Who won
wtf - billy lynch garnier - 3 sick freestylers and they lost 6-1

I STILL get goosebumps every time I hear you guys sing Crazier Than You! <3
Oliver: *cheeky assgrab at 9:14 *\nMe: *chokes on air*
The chemistry between you and Oliver is insane. Whether you may be together or not, you're definitely friendship goals and I envy it so much
does anyone not have a crush on oliver
Carrie, I got to meet you last week and I didn't get a word out of my mouth because I was so starstruck and nervous🙈  But I managed to put all my thoughts on you into words on my vlog of that day, so I would love love love you to see it! 💕 Also, Scott and Oliver take over my vlog and are absolutely adorable so check that out! 😄🙌🏼
I saw this in Glasgow and god it was amazing live, she is SO talented and I actually didn't know it was her at the time but I watch her video Fleming and I love her so much, realising I was really near her is amazing. Bravo, she was the most talented singer there in my opinion <3
Just got my letter back from you, thank you carrie💖💖
Hey Carrie! I love you and your videos sooo much, you're a huge inspiration! My middle school just finished the production of the Addams family young@part, in which I played the 50s ancestor. I love you sooooo much!
Just wanted to say how much I enjoyed the show this evening. My husband and I came to watch it in Glasgow. You were absolutely fantastic!! You're voice blew us away. Great job, I'll be recommending it to friends and family 😊
Can you do a video with mortitia I love your videos and it means a lot for you to make them I belive having a chanel has a big impact on your life i have just started a performing arts group and I would love some tips plus I just think you are amazing I hope you take this message into consideration because I guess you have a lot of people saying this stuff to you but I door belive it would mean so much to me thank you so much Joe xx
Watched Adams family last night at the kings thearter ! ,😀😍❤
Wait. Carrie. Why did you change ure name. It was perfect
Saw you in belfast, you all were insanely good!!\nThank you for an amazing show 💙💙
Will they be realising a soundtrack for the Addams family, I would pay so much to get that
HEARING YOU SING ONE NORMAL NIGHT AGAIN MADE ME CRY
Carrie, I'm not commenting on this video to tell you how good it is or that you and Oliver would be an awesome couple. I'm commenting to tell you just how awesome you are as a person, please never change even if people tell you to. Xxx
Are her and Oliver dating???!!!
There's a Catan app???
Heyy Carrie!! Please please could you and oliver record a version of 'crazier than you' im obssessed with the song but noone else sings it as well as you guys! Xxxxx
Olly, you need one of the Newt Hufflepuff scarves from Fantastic Beasts. They sell them and they are much more subtle.
MORE SCOTT!!! Miss seeing his beautiful face xxx!
Hi I'm coming to see the show in a few weeks time yay
Great video! Do you happen to have a business contact email?
Does anyone know if there are going to be any more tour dates after the Singapore trip? My sister and I wanna come see the show but we have to fly in from Holland so have to plan it because of school and vacations
My boyfriend and I had one of our first dates in that very Maggie Mays ❤️
My sister did the same thing with my birthday present. I was planning to buy some shampoo/conditioner the week before (luckily i didn't) and she got me the EXACT TWO I wanted (I love Juicy and American Cream)... even though they weren't the same as the ones i just finished. Love it when that happens :)\n\nAlso, as ever, love your videos, always put a smile on my face!
Will you guys be doing a cast recording of the show? I just saw a play of it at my college and I loved the show! I would LOVE to have the soundtrack with you in it! 💜
I will be there this Saturday at the Kings Theatre Glasgow and taking my older sister, as a treat because she is an amazing sister.  I can not wait.  Been following you on here Carrie and the time has come to see the show.  Hope you enjoy your time in Glasgow x
Saw you in the opening night at the Grand Opera House, you (and everyone else!) were awesome!!! It was my friend's first ever time at the theatre and she really, really enjoyed it :) Had to dash for a train so couldn't wait and stage door to tell you how much I enjoyed it in person, but hopefully I'll see you again in the future and can tell you then!
OMG you and Scott’s rendition of Somewhere Over The Rainbow is beautiful😄
So weird seeing you in places that are so familiar to me! Loved meeting you Carrie, you were so sweet as always
I saw you perform last night at the Kings theatre it was amazing loved the show , you were all great 💖💖
CAN NOT WAIT!! UR COMING TO ME NEXT WEEK AND IM COMING TO WATCH!!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE COME TO STAGE DOOR!!
I'll be so so sad when tour is over bc I love the Adams family vlogs :(
Ok. I know I'm probably way behind the times, but why/when did the channel change names? I could have sworn that there was a (relatively) recent video where she talked about how she WOULDN'T change it because of the significance of the phrase It's way past your bedtime to her life. DID I DREAM THAT? AM I CRAZY?
I seriously think Carrie has the perfect voice. That is to say, if I could be Ursula and steal anyone’s voice it would be hers!💜🖤
Oliver's monkey impression looked more like Zoidberg😂
I actually went to see that in Belfast because we're doing the addams family in november \nP.s. I'm the granny \nP.s.s. I was the guy with the stupid laugh
Absolutely loved seeing you perform! Kinda raging that I didn't bump into you at all seeing as my work is directly next the Opera house.
At the end of the tour, we need a full dance cover of crazier than you!! :D
So I watched this with my husband, and when the video ended his response was: Wait we have to wait for the Unicorn!?\nAnd now he is sad that there aren't anymore videos to watch till next week.
One Normal Night is one of my fav songs from the Musical and you totally sing it the best ! wish could hear recorded version.
Now we all just wanna know what happened to the unicorn
I've just realised that Oliver reminds me of John Barrowman and now I can't unsee it. 😫
Absolutely loved meeting you in Belfast! Hope you liked the summer night fruit tea 💕💕
I need to see the fully grown unicorn. This isn’t fair
Enjoyed this show so so much absolutely incredible!
The real question is, where on earth did that dragonfly necklace come from? it's gorgeous!
But what about the unicorn though? THE SUSPENSE IS KILLING ME!!!
Can anybody find the jumper from Zara she is wearing and link it! Im in love with it! I see you on Friday night and I CANNOT wait!!! xx
why the youtube name change? I loved it :( xx
I saw you LIVE! I was skooked to the core. your voice is seriously amazing. well done!!!
It's the elevation is my new excuse! Hahaha
When she said end of the day ... is it ok if I sang “end of the day another day over” les mis
Hey I was just wondering, how long do these musicals usually run for?
My ticket arrived last week so I’m getting more and more excited now and even have a sticker in my planner for the day 8 come to see the show. Yeah I’m a nerd lol
didn't even think to look for a catan app for my phone! Love the game. might have to go look for it now.
I actually can't cope that you are in Maggie mays like 2 minutes from my flat 🙈 seen you while you were here, me and my best friend had the best night, amazing show
Also your voice is a POWERHOUSE
you were amazing on saturday! love you xo
Ok I've always wanted to know the answer to this: HOW do actors in musicals not CONSTANTLY LOSE THEIR VOICES?!! That's so much constant stress on your voice omg
Anyone else find it hilarious that she was dressed as Wednesday talking about wanting a giant unicorn 😂😂
Scott has me wondering about his range. I had an oh snap moment when he took it up a free octaves.
But what happened with the unicorn??? 🦄🦄🦄
I saw you guys in that theatre Thursday and it was amazing! 10/10
whenever you film onstage and show all the seats it makes me so happy :) you're my inspiration, carrie ♥
I started SNORTING with laughter at 9:16 like OH MY GOD
What is the music for the signing clip?
Are her and Dan still friends??
Are.... are we sure they aren’t dating....?
Although they're in the same family, zebras make different barking sounds than horses do, so it stands to reason that unicorns would make different sounds as well.  Something more lyrical perhaps?
Forget Oliver, I want to see more of the woman with the purple headband @6:40  :D
Maybe it's just me but you seem a bit wicked dressed as Wednesday, the character takes over and nice Carrie is no more.
So nice seeing the inside of my favourite place to work in whilst I'm across the water in Liverpool for Uni.
You where wearing that necklace today as well, very cool!! Where did you get it? And whoop for the Stitch pj!!
Love “watch me, Wednesday” xx😀 now which shop did you get that beautiful green scarf from??
I must admit, after being introduced to the new cast on Sunday night at the London Poladium, I wasn't sure what to think, since watching these vlogs I've found it quite reassuring that you guys are doing a great job at taking the show on!
It's like we're inside a jewelry box! 😍 That is what it looks like!! I've always dreamed of being that little ballerina inside a music box... Carrie, you really were! 💕
so so excited for the addam's family in singapore!!!!
CARRIEEEE WHY DID YOU CHANGE YOUR USERNAMEEEEE 💕
Is the dear Evan Hansen cover (with you and Oliver) ever going to be uploaded? I NEED a full version in my life! 💕
I could watch HOURS of Carrie, Ollie, Scott, and the rest of the cast just having fun and singing their hearts out. I'm always so sad to see the vlogs end. I look forward to them every week and they always make me smile so much. Keep up the great work, Carrie! <3
That unicorn is the biggest cliffhanger...
Love the scarves! :) <3
TRENDINGGG
YOUARESOPRETTYBEAUTIFULFUNNTANDTALENTED AAAAAA
That riff at 5:56 ❤️❤️❤️❤️
So cute
Wonderful 😍
1:32 IM NOT IMPULSIVE (I'd never ask that of you)
cant believe I missed the live where carried opened the presents :(
All these comments are basically the same thing 😂 least Carrie has everyone's approval if she wants it 😂❤️
100% confused if she's with pete or Oliver
I get the feeling that u and Oliver are dating
Are Carrie and Oliver together
annoys me that at the beginning of the video Carrie say tom youre gooing to;... then he says 'I nearly said I'm going to belfast, you're going there, I'm going to the other one'. Im going to the other one, as if theres only two airports in Ireland or two places in Ireland worth going to. \nA lot of musicians, comedians, youtubers etc, often think this way. No one every goes to other counties or venues outside Dublin or Belfast when there are plenty. Theres Galway, Cork, Sligo, and loads of other places these type of entertainers/artists could go but just don't for reasons I dont know. \nEd Sheeran is the first artist to broaden his tour locations within Ireland, set to play in both Cork and Galways as well as the typical Dublin and Belfast shows.\nObviously Tom didn't mean anything by this at all, saying 'I'm going to the other one', and he's not the only artist/entertainer or whatever to think like this, that Dublin and Belfast are the only places in Ireland to go. But I just felt it was worth pointing out even. This might seem like a small thing to a lot of Carrie's English fans, but Ireland is often a second thought to many of these people and most British people know very little about Ireland and our history so likely don't know that most of our country isn't considered or thought of for things such as gigs and Dublin is where most people would have to go to see one of their favorite  artists.
EXCUSE ME BUT I WAS NOT READY FOR THAT BUM SQUEEZE
''its like we're inside a jewellery box!'' that was so adorable :3
I'm so upset that you were in Belfast just weeks after I moved away for uni! 💔💔
anyone know the song at 0:25
How beautiful to see Sharon and Charles interacting.  Thank you for this intimate glimpse into her world.
Yes! Sharon and Charles together!  Miss them both.
Brought a tear to my eye, seeing Sharon and Charles living it up, having a good time, doing what they did best..... RIP Sharon and Charles.
Bosco and the team- Thanks for making and posting this, it's a beautiful tribute. I still can't re-watch the documentary yet, I just miss this woman and her energy. This made me cry like a baby... She will live forever in the music, thanks again, can't wait to hear her final album.
Rest In Power Sharon!
I miss her so much, everyday. Sharon and Charles have left indelible marks on all of us, and the music world. I know that they are jamming up in Heaven with Prince, Tom Petty, DB and so many other musical heroes we have lost. Thank you, Daptone for this incredible video, and for producing real, powerful soul music!
This moved me in so many ways. I'm sad that Sharon and Charles are no longer with us, but their art will outlive us all and for that I am so very grateful.
I'm also writing this message with tears streaming down my face.  Glad to have had the opportunity to see Sharon last September when Miss Sharon Jones was playing in Brooklyn.  I'll always cherish that moment.  So grateful we still have her music and movie!  Great video!
Nothing but Love & Respect for Charles & Sharon R.I.P x
The best performer I've ever seen. Still can't believe she's gone. What a beautiful song.
Not one dislike. As it should be.
The Queen is back... Forever!
Man, I miss her and Charles.
Maravilhosa!❤😘 I love her!
A beautiful tribute!
I love this! What a great voice!
Sharon and Charles were taken from us much to early. Timeless soul music great performers.\nThey are missed
One of the most beautiful souls ever to grace a stage. Wherever you are Sharon, we love you; we miss you.
I'm feelin' this song
What an amazing tribute to Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings. My heart breaks for the entire band-they lost a sister in soul, and quite frankly lost their livelihood. One only has to read about the trials and tribulations the band went through when Sharon fought cancer the first time to realize if they don't tour, they make no money. Thanks to everyone downloading music or using these free services, there is precious little money in recording music and selling it.\nDo the band a favor, do Daptones records a favor, and buy 10 copies of this CD for your friends and family. There will never be a band quite like SJDK again. Bosch/Gabe, thanks for making this all happen.
Beautiful, what an amazing energy!
Sharon forever you'll stay in our hearts !
This is a lovely tribute. Bravo, Daptone.
Que saudade...
I loved her and the great band plays with Amy too. This clip it's a dream...
I'm not scared to grow old now
Even in her last days, she still full of energy. Definitely one of the best that the world ever seen
more than music Sharon Jones and Charles Bradley .... Never Forget
I miss her every day. Thank you Daptone!
Chilling to see both Sharon and Charles together.
Thanks, Daptone!  Love and miss you, Sharon and Charles.
Sounds great!  Can't wait for it to be released!  Wow...in seeing Charles Bradley in this video.  RIP to them both!!
Rip
True Gem!
Forever Legends RIP † @2:21
Miss her.
Beautiful
Loved it!
💙
Only time I got a record signed and a kiss smack on the lips to go with it! Miss you Sharon, rest well.
oh yeah! love and miss Sharon
fabulous!!
All that guy could taste was regret...
Man no wonder people think Americans are stupid
0:31 that’s the face of regret

High IQ....
Where did this happen? Phoenix?
Is this the Krusty Krab?
LMAO. WHAT A SHAMEFULLY EATEN NUGGET, He looked so depressed with himself for just spending $10 on one dumbass nugget.  Then the regret kicked in when he realized he was being recorded.  😂😂😂😂

What's so special about szechuan sauce?
Mc Donald's \nIs soo A typical that this is NOT even funny . this global company literally is making money off this . Quasie attitude you post regardless because they are so stable in the market. It would actually be funny if you just got an outfit an started working there. Ha
Mmm supply and demand working at its finest.....
his face says it all... it aint worth it
THAT FUCKIN NUMALE CUCK TAKING THE MONEY FROM HIS FATHER
If only the guy selling looked more jewish this would be perfect.
A sauce that has been nearly forgotten for 19 years, suddenly blows up in popularity because of one show
Eat from a strangers hands for 10$. Did he wash his hands?
i fucking love how his face shows the worthiness
Why are People so stupid these days
0:21 why is that the perfect representation of the rick and morty fanbase
0:05 you can see how the guy asked for his father to borrow the 10 bucks lmao
I had this sauce before. It was good, but not $10 a pop good. Particularly notable for the sesame sauce aftertaste that lasted hours.
I do not understand how can he sell something inside the macdonalds. Isnt it wrong to sell other things inside another shop
It's no scam, they got exactly what they paid for; what an inspirational merchant.
And people thought MLP & Steven Universe fans were cancer. R&M fans are super AIDs double cancer.
It's fake 4 guys set this up!
Dumb kid. \nThey were selling for 800 dollars on eBay. \n\nCongratulations on missing out on a fortune.
The idiots paying 10 bucks are stupid but that’s actually a good idea to get idiots to pay 10 bucks for it
i blame baby boomers for this shit
This shows the elites the true nature of people. They can watch this and justify there own actions since the first chance this dude got he started exploiting people, reassuring the elites that any of us they are causing suffering would have done just the same if we was in the same position the elites currently are. He had a chance to share valuable limited resources the sauce like people preach for the corrupt people to do but then we dont do it ourself at the first chance we get?
Somebody help me out, is this sauce expensive or rare or what?
This seshuan sauce has been blown way out of proportion
Half expecting Rick to walk in with 100 dollar bills in his hands.
Thank you Rick and Morty you proved our world is fat enough to pay $10 for a bit of sauce and nugget
It's my series arc Morty, 9 seasons morty
This sums up Americans in a chicken nugget.
How is he allowed to do this inside the place where it was sold
Capitalism has gotten out of hand
THE LOOK ON THE NERDS FACE JESUS MAKES ME LAUGH
Rick and Morty fans: we're smart cos we watch Rick and Morty, the rest of you guys are fucking retards cos you don't understand the show\n\nAlso Rick and Morty fans:
The most American thing ive ever watched
-pays 10 usd for a nugget\n-eats it in one go
Please help me I am in great pain.
It wasn’t worth it👎
That guy doesn’t seem impressed
That man is a genius.
What a fucking fool. The look on his face when he's asked if its worth it. Of course  its not fucking  worth it
Don't these guys know anything about hygiene?!
Its a scam a few people In on it and they buy and say its nice so other normal people buy like sheep
Is this in Canada
These rick and morty fans are so fucking cringe smh
you paid a man 10 dollars to dip a nugget in some shite sauce, if i was your dad ill slap the shit out of you and disown you for life.
Why did i watch this 😒
Is this a live action Ed, Edd and Eddy?
Capitalist at its best! 😂😂😂
you can buy szechuan sauce from the chinese down the road from me. they do it with seafood or meat
People in the comments will gladly hand over money for overpriced iPhones, celebrity endorsed makeup, cars, and sneakers etc but think it's dumb to buy a nugget dipped in sauce for ten bucks ......
The world is fucked.
Think for yourself, don't be sheep
Jimmy neutron in ten years
The aspiring entrepreneur seems to touch the money and hold the nugget using the same hand. Not only the idiot will get the chance to taste the sauce for $10, he will also get E coli for free. Great deal!
He then sold them air for $20
Fair play to the guy hustling these idiots
Good for him. Just like people that pay $1,000 for a phone.
Well, time to stop watching rick and morty and associating myself with the horde of asshats that claim to be fans......
Lol the guy stuffs it in and crosses his arms like yes I'm a badass
:24 That is the face of defeated, beaten man.
What a stupid fucking video.
how is this trending
Even Sheeps are smarter than this 😐
Who came from WillNE vid?
Wtf why  is this trending for ?
biggest asshole
Wow much intelligent\n\n\nSuch intellects

Worlds gone mad 🙈
Fucking sad fat americunts😂
Mc Jewed
What is szechuan sauce lol
Please meme gods make 0:25 a meme
All these comments hating on Rick and Morty fans saying they can't be as clever as they think they are for spending $10 a nugget.....I argue the dude selling the nuggets is the biggest fan in the room and he's a fucking genius
I am 60 and watch you both
OMG YESSS! I'm so sick of every youtube channel being targeted to children and everything being censored and bleeped or not spoken about. I'm 20 years old and i struggle so hard to find people I relate to. and often even when I watch youtubers my own age, they still target their videos to children and do 'back to school crap and how to make friends etc. I was overcome with joy when louise did that big video about changing her channel and I think more people need to!!
Why wasn't Louise invited to the Janya wedding, tho?
The day Louise made the video announcing the change in her channel I hit subscribe so fast! I was so excited! Love when youtubers are genuine!
I got divorced, met a man on tinder and got pregnant YES YES YES LOUISE I LOVE YOU
Im a 13 year old watching this. Tbh most of the adult/puberty things I know I've learnt by watching Louise. Don't worry tho my parents know that I watch these videos and my mums watched some of Louises videos to make sure they're appropriate for me to watch. I think the videos educate people my age xxx
That ending was so hilarious with both of them getting the giggles. I kinda go with Jim about the change in content. I first started watching all the vloggers. But, I've only really stuck to those who have grown their content up. It fits better with me, and, it also means the style of the vids changes. It isn't the same thing over and over where you can tell the creator isn't really into it anymore. I've never felt like that on this channel.
30s are the best so far.
Love it! The answers are so interesting!
Are his comments moderated? =\
I started watching YouTube when I was 16, and I’m now 23. I’d say I grew up with some of you.
Louise I honestly think your a great role model cause I'm 16 and you show people like me that life isn't all butterflies and sparkles and things happen and they might not all be ideal or what you have planned but that's just how it is and I really like that cause I'm definitely not perfect and I wouldn't idolise someone that is in my eyes I want someone like me. In my eyes someone that isn't perfect and that has relationship problems or that has mental health problems there perfect too me cause they are showing there real them and not hiding anything. Well that's my opinion anyways :-)
I completly agree with Louise about not deleting her pictures, my mom also died when I was a kid and I would have loved to have more pictures of her, good thing about social media, you may have very embarassing pictures but in the future either you or any other person would to anything to remember those moments
Enjoyed this video... you two are hilarious but insightful! Would love more of this...
Considering what kids are watching on TV now, I hardly think a little bit of swearing in a YouTube video is damaging! 😂
I love you two so much, for what it's worth - you're both good role models x
On the topic of changing your content, i actually find that i'm more likely to stay subscribed to a channel if there content grows up purely because i've grown up too :)
Okay, honestly, my favorite video of yours. Maybe ever? ❤️
I do RE at a catholic school and we are taught to believe that Genesis (Adam and Eve story) isn't actually true, and is just a metaphor for how powerful God is
I was not the one that lost it LOL
Awe!! You all are so great!! Her hair is so pretty!!
I like to think of myself as a realistic christian Louise I don't think I've related to you more than when you were talking about religion.
it's like two work colleagues forced to work together
I’m 20. Should I ask my mom if I can watch this? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObviously kidding.
Ahhh I want a friendship like Louise and Jims :)
I am not a Christian, but if you don't take the 6 days of creation literally and assume a 'day' means a different length of time, the story is actually in the same order of creation as evolution.
Love both of your channels, Louise more so since her content changed. I've just turned 27 and always felt too old to watch some but you two have always been my favourites regardless. As you've both grown, I have too. Watching the two of you together is hilarious!
the music is too loud
I started watching Louise more after the end of an era. I loved her more whilst she was being herself- i could sense she wasn't truly being herself in videos before that. Love you Louise!!!
Jim gives me the fucking creeps he's like an overgrown 12 year old
Hi everyone,\nThis you tuber is trying to raise $50,000 for 10 Cancer Patients. Please donate if you can, thanks so much: https://www.gofundme.com/luckielifestyle\nHis Youtube Channel is: Luckie Lifestyle
Three Men and a Little Lady! Fave film 😍
What does 'lowering the tone' mean? I'm in the dark here...
I love that the content changes because we can grow with you and watch the creator make the cc content they want to create. It feels more natural x
This video looked so awkward. Jim does not seem to be on the same page/feel comfortable throughout this entire video...
Jim, most Christians don't believe evolution and Christianity conflict...
Threw everyone I watch from Zoe all the way to Shane Dawson my mom has watched a least one video of ever YouTuber I watch. She has never complained about what they have been talking about especially how foul of a mouth Shane has. She realizes now they have all made me the person I am , she loves them all as well. She never once made me stop watching someone and it really helped our relationship and made it stronger with how much she trusted me. I just wish some parents would understand that , I'm not one myself...but it really helps the child trust me.
Aww I’ve missed these two together! 😁
Same thoughts re: evolution and Christianity.  Love Louise ❤️❤️
Im a Christian and I believe God created the Earth and everything in it, in all its sciency goodness. Im not the only one, theres tons of Christian scientists. Be open minded about it, you will be surprised by your own wrong misconceptions.
Is it bad , im 14 and i watch louises videos X
The ad on this video was your book on audible lol xx
I get my book tomorrow!!! So excited!
Louise has lost a good bit of weight go her
omfg the background music is so distracting, its like fake laughter in tv shows pls stop
i don't think the adam and eve story was meant to be like a direct description haha. most ppl take the view that the seven day creation thing is a v brief description of millions/billions of years of evolution. and the adam and eve story is to serve a purpose of telling the story of original sin and it explains well why the world can be bad. most christians believe that a lot of the bible consists of stories/metaphors that tell us something abt God. my idea of science is that is doesn't contradict religion at all, science is the study of God's creation! ^*^
JIM What hairdryer do you use, do you use it everyday, what hair product/s do you use and do you style your hair everyday?
Eminem ripping Trump a new one isn't on the trending list, but this total garbage is......
I started my YouTube channel to get comfortable in front of a camera, I went to an acting school for tv and movies, and we were in front of cameras doing audition practice. So it was a way for me to get used to that. Now I love it!
Louise, my dad died when I was young. I think all the time about how in the future my kids will be able to watch my videos because I would have loved to have something like this of my dad. Im sorry about your mom, but I’m glad to know I’m not the only one who thinks about this
Irrelavant to the video but what lipstick does louise have on?
You look particularly handsome in this video Jim 😁
Was shookt when Louise said that Darcy was 6 years old!!! All I remember is itty bitty toddler Darcy 🙊
I THINK THAT the only reason why Loise wasnt invited to the wedding is bcos of Tanya...
Pretty woman? The film??
my name is Jim too HAHA
Oh😍 Jim you are so handsome!
i love the film louise was talking about Talladega nights : Ballad of Ricky Bobby <3
See, the two of you touching on religion has made me want to see a video purely talking about faith and religion. Especially as you have a degree on the same subject. Xx
I really enjoyed you talking to each other even more than answering the questions - especially the take on being a realistic Christian and mature content. Good stuff.
Dear louise, \n                             I think you are a great role model. You might of made some bad choices but you are still inspirational because you have managed to make a life out of your situations. You now have a beautiful daughter so keep bing louise\nXx
The vast majority of Christians believe in evolution. Religious truth and scientific truth have the same source and therefore cannot contradict each other.
Is the thing Louise said at the start monsters Inc. Xx love you guys
I'm 12 and I watched the lost condom video lol
On the science/Christian thing - my brother is a ‘scientist’ (degree in science and science nerd) and he’s a devout Christian - preaches a lot etc. I think it’s all about being open minded and tolerant of everything. \n\nGreat video guys :-) you’re awesome!
I totally forgot I added a question and just for the fun of it I watched this video, finding out you answered my question! How cool is that! Thank you lots and lots for the answer and for turning it into a conversation about porn, hahaha. Ohh and Jim, you pronounced my name best! It's difficult, I know. Just say it as you read it! Much love again, Sjarlie!
I'm glad your content has matured. I started watching you when I was 16 and I'm 20 now so I've been able to grow up with your content.
Science was originally designed to prove christianity. Just because it has gone on to prove the theory of evolution it doesn't and shouldn't effect a persons belief in any religion.
Jim 😂🙈😂 14:33 ahaja poor Louise \nmaybe subscribe. but if you don't want to don't omg
It’s so refreshing to see a Christian believe in something other than Adam and Eve, yet the way you explained it as thinking Adam and Eve is a metaphor is brilliant. It doesn’t belittle  the belief of Adam and Eve, but puts a reasonable sensible thought process to it.
You two are so funny together
Louise, I always thought you were younger than me, but we're the same age.
the movie is Angus thongs and perfect snogging
That end bit about subscribing to Louise made me laugh so hard.
Louise and Jim are the best combination, neither of you beat around the bush with what you're saying and I love it!
Jim, you definitely have the gift of gab (a great asset for you).When are you and Tyler doing another collaboration?
What was the movie was Louise talking about?
I am proud for  my family to watch Jims channel.  He is a sweetheart and  very real, not like the others who put on airs and  fake
When Louise and Jim were trying to call people my phone started ringing 😂
Would watch Jim and Tan in anything xxx such good videos!!!❤
this is the best video
Honestly I cannot focus with the music in the background. Maybe it's just me but it drives me mad
I haven't watched Jim in years. I found the desperate to be a children's tv presenter vibe just too much.  Happy Louise has made a  reintroduction happen.
Music is too loud and beat-ey
Louise looks gorgeous! xx
HAHAH I want to hear Louise's story about losing the condom, anyone know which video that is??
Jim deserves more views.
When Harry met sally!!
Love Talladega Nights.
:))) lol
It's Madagascar 3!
PART 2 !!!!!
Beaches #9glitterpoints
Love Louise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Have you ever tried this adult dating site?

ha-OKyNiHNE,\nhttps://t.co/A5hfDGuBWx
i'm not going to leave one of those mediocre comments saying 'oh i wish that they were all close like they were a few years ago' because the reality is, they've all found their path in life now. some, successful authors and others working in the fashion industry. ultimately, i'm so proud of all of them. they're all doing their thing, and are smashing it. well done 'old crew' of youtube <3
3 men and a little lady! one of my fave films! x
I really think you should stop swearing
the music was fucking annoying - clicked off
Gross perverted old pieces of shits!!! Fuck you Donna K. Wait till it happens to you.  And I'll say bitch you had it coming by what you were wearing. Even if it was overalls.
who are the other creeps of holly wood. what about the pedophiles?
Not a video about Trump!? Is this really John Oliver? Or an impostor?
The left jokes about actual sexual assault when it's one of their own. But Trump can't make a fucking joke about gold diggers. You sheep are an utter disgrace, drink engine coolant and save the planet
All that preaching celebrities, producers and directors do on award shows about their progressive ways, yet Hollywood is still decades behind in its fair treatment/casting of people of color, women and gays. They like to pat themselves on the back, but they really need to kick each other in the ass.\n\nThis industry that has the nerve to attack Donald Trump for his treatment of the same segment of people I just mentioned, while god knows how many are doing the exact same thing or are being willfully ignorant (and no I am not a fucking Trump supporter in the least, just pointing out the hypocrisy).\n\nAfter this I think Hollywood needs to get off their soapbox for a while and start getting it's own house in order.
Donna Karen doesnt look remotely close to a female so she should just shut her face :)

Perverts & pedophiles thrive in this country. These men live the double standard and  can afford to get away with anything. I refuse to watch Woody Allen movies and cannot stand the way he is honored in movie industry. Trump is another pig and liar. So many of them out there destroying everything good. These so-called men should be shipped off to an island somewhere and be forced to live among their own kind.
WTF A fashion designer victim blaming girls for how they dress. Most ironic thing I have ever heard in my life, what a trashy idiot.
By way of introduction:\nhttps://youtu.be/R_JXTiYC0PE\n\nDr. Sadler’s honest book review:\nhttps://youtu.be/U7_8pJy9iSs\n\nYou may also wish to order: https://www.amazon.com/Meditations-Self-Discipline-Failure-Exercise-Fitness/dp/1785355872 Thank you for your time!
Donna Karan needs to sit the fuck down and have SEVERAL seats with her ugly ass
I got my popsocket and a mount here.love it!! also cheapest price so far 😊\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B0761M51W9\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B0762V7JXL
So when a women walks around in public with her pants stuck right up her ass and cunt in plain view of everyone what exactly is the message other than I am a vain and ignorant slut? Are you trying to tell us that girls can act like sluts and use their sexuality as social currency and they shouldn't be held responsible for their actions. I hope to hell that you are not the father of a girl Mr. Oliver cause that is complete nonsense.
another perverted rapist liberal and other liberals were okay with it for years
Angie confidently told everyone what he did and then she left it. \nIf that was me I would be fucking raging and qould contact the police immediately.\n\nI know people say its not easy to say bla bla bla but if youre literally going to tell every single person there except the police then whats the fucking point
Affleck almost made it out of the bit of the segment. Almost
It's a terrible thing that he forced himself on this women. Rape is a terrible thing. But can you really blame these guys for the casting couch thing? As long as the actress agrees I don't see what the problem is. Again, this is only if both parties agree to it. Nothing should be forced. Yeah, not agreeing might cost you a role, but sometimes you have to give up something to get something.
Its almost shocking how ignorant she is.
Donna Karen never wants to sell clothes to a feminist ever again....mission accomplished!
See 1791L's video about Hollywood's hypocrisy. THAT should be trending.
soon porn stars will blame their producers of sexual attack
You would think these empowered women would protect each other but NAH.
Yeah don't mention that Harvey Weinstein was a Democrat donor or show clips of Michelle Obama, John Podesta, and Bill Clinton all thanking him.\
Check out this amazing video https://youtu.be/3P-6-UXIsB0
Are you aware that the Stock Market Just hit 23,000 Great job Mr President I was told that if you became President it was going to crash. And so many idiots actually believed. 23k
Logan paul was on jimmy kimmil live
Hollywood liberal feminazis are a bunch of fucking hypocrites, they destroy one abuser while Woody Allen, Bill Cosby, Polanski, Casey Affleck are still working as if nothing, still are Academy members, the hypocrisy of these people is really unbelievable.
Polanski and Cosby, sure, but I don't agree with lumping Mel Gibson in with those pervs.
Finally a video NOT about Trump. Stop going for low hanging fruit,  that's where your talent is Mr Oliver.
Donna says women dress like they're asking for it while dressing like a prostitute. lololololololol
Sounds like everyone in the industry were aware and they didn't do anything. So they are all guilty.
I couldn't find any proof that Casey Affleck will be presenting the award for Best Actress at the next Oscars. I don't think that's true
so he touched people without there consent ???
if demand overwhelm supply=citizens get punished. both Dems/rep been bribed to allow crazy deductibles/premiums. they give themselves special subsides to avoid negatives.daca/migrant crisis(import consumers)=bad for usa=inflation/costs abnormal
Can't get rid of Dan brown or superman or harry potter and a bunch more of repeating garbage.
Interesting that he left out Woody Allen as one of the people who initially didn't condemn Weinstein's actions.
how many days did it take ya john to finally crack a joke on this rapist ..I guess you had to get permission first.
*Guessing game : Question*         Is Donna Karen Animal, vegetable, or Mineral ?
To the media/academia establishment: Harvey Weinstein is Hollywood's problem, not society's problem, not my problem. I don't support or condone Hollywood. I'm a normal guy, I don't sexually assault women. Therefore I don't need to be lectured about something I don't do. Go lecture Hollywood. Go police your own, leave me out of it.
Thank John for having a pair and talking about this
So thats hollywood ...the popes right hand man in the popes Vatican  the uk royal family the PM of uk past  how many more hi profile people do you need to spell out how fucked up the so called leaders are
what a shame for oscar representing producer he is just nasty with ugly face
I wonder who's dick john Oliver sucked to get this late night show
The one thing John Oliver and I agree on
Donna Karen looks like Alice the Goon from Popeye. LMAO!!!
Is it just me or does everyone still remember when this idiot begged Trump to run for president?  What a fool me made himself look. Trump got the ultimate payback.
So The people who have been preaching to the masses, have been caught defending a rapist.  They all knew - they all did nothing!\n\nHollywood is a cesspool - Trump needs to drain that swamp too!
2 minutes on Weinstein, average 15 minutes on trump videos. Hmmm. Not a fan of trump but I feel like they are taking it light on Harvey Weinstein.
John Oliver has had sex with Weinstein....
Harvey Weinstein is a piece of shit but Donna Karen looks like Sarah Jessica Parker stopped in the middle of a sex change operation and smacked herself with Harvey's ugly stick.
Donna looks like a fucking vampire, she looks long dead already
Must apologise for this English prick fuck knows how he got a show oh yeah licking liberal ass 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
low vibration virtue signalling
No ads 🤔
Hillary Clinton knew
John Oliver is a DNC propaganda spewing paedophile
Fuck off John
Fuck Hollywood

for once this jackass is making sense
Everyone is being duped again...\nHarvey Weinstein is being blamed for the mistreatment of women in the industry, but nothing will change because the real problem hasn't been addressed. They covered it up completely\n\nThe biggest problem in Hollywood is and always will be pedophilia Corey Haim and Corey Feldman\nLook up Shirley Temple, Shia Lebouf's father, Nicole Kidmans father, Oprah Winfrey childhood, Charlie Sheen, Woody Allen, Elijah Wood, Roman Polanski, Marilyn Monroe (OG casting couch), and hundreds of others\nHollywood elites are in human trafficking. They are connected to Washington D.C., Silicon Valley, Arab elites, Asian elites.\nI could name thousands of others in other industries. (Vatican, Congresses, Presidents, Prime Ministers, Monarchs)\n\nIts not about women at all. Its about children. But this will never be mentioned, but covered up by MSM because media elites are in on it too.\n\nJohn Oliver, like every other Late Night host, is a shill for the Global Power Elite. Nothing will change from this.
So if everyone knew why are they making out like it was a big secret and dark organisation. Girls are sexualising themselves and not expecting attention.
John Oliver's show is one of the few that holds no punches. Funny & informative.
I'd love to be Harvey Weinstein
like your gonna get somewhere in Hollywood without sucking Jew dicks
Uh oh, we have direct video proof of a liberal condemning Weinstein, and it's within a typical con's attention span. How are they supposed to accuse him of saying nothing now?\n\nOh, right, alternative facts.
This is almost as ugly as British Parliament..
This guy is a joke what's with all this Brits in American tv? No funny people in America?if a Mexican picks tomatos he's steeling jobs but idiots like this no problem.
Not appropriate to group Mel Gibson with those males
LoL,   most of his vids have '3 mil. views' but of course this one has less than '1 mil'       \n    You've got to be brain dead to believe view counts on '''''''trending'''''  videos
Liberals always want to lecture. STFU.  All these actress take the millions and fame and stay
Spin doctor U.K.
I wonder why John Oliver named Polanski, Cosby, Gibson but didn’t include Bill Clinton. He had his own bimbo eruptions squad led by Hillary.
Hillary knows how Harvey acted
how can america finde this man funny hes anooying cunt
Whaat fhhheee fuck
John Olive is a perv
wow he went a whole 3 minutes without mentioning donald trump
Can we expel Mia Farrow from the Academy from sucking Woody Allen's cock for movie roles while banging Sinatra behind his back?? Passing off Ronan as his son? What a crock of shit. There is nothing women love more than sitting on their high horse of victimhood. \nThe guy's a bit of a douchebag. He's not Jeffrey Dahmer. Fuck this PC crap. Weinstein is a great producer.
Why is this trending?
Wouldn't be surprised if John Oliver was a nonce to be honest.
Why not go to the police?? Im not downplaying the disgusting behavior, but serious, if you have a person sexually harassing you... GO TO THE POLICE!!
There are hundreds of people in Hollywood just like Harvey Weinstein running around preying on women and kids.  The industry breeds it...
Would bet all of my money that John Oliver knew as well and now he's jumping in after the fact like everyone else. Hollywood is like this, has always been like this, everyone knows who the creeps are and no one will do anything about it because they care more about their career than anything else in the world. Entertainers are most self absorbed and attention craving people on planet, this will never change - ever.
*her smile: creepy.*
Haha. Go home you limey fuck.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, stop....yes, Donna Karen is crazy and wrong, but can we talk for a second about how she is apparently a mummy? Imhotep looked less creepy.
Harvey the best of liberal values
The world DOES NOT NEED Hollywood. It is a parasite and destroyer of souls. Hollywood needs to end and we the people need to end it.
Sure John Oliver isn't that funny but sometimes he can be.
I posted on Facebook many times on this subject, and what is most disturbing is how readily and easily men are forced to deny an aspect of themselves in order to condemn Weinstein.   A woman would be expected to react a certain way, but I want every man to look inside themselves and ask a very simple question: Do woman have a genuine respect for my desires?
Uhhh excuse me, Since when was Mel Gibson a sexual predator??! Seems bizarrely and unfairly out of place being lumped in with Cosby and Polanski, and would not be surprised if he verbally took this weasel to task over it.
Putting Roman Polanski and Bill Cosby in the same comparison to Mel Gibson is horrible. Especially when Gibson has apologized on many occasions and is finally getting his life back in order. Sorry, someone who made some horrible statements in his past is not the same as raping women or being a pedophile.
Well, actually, no matter what year it is John, humans are still humans and haven't achieved some evolutionary leap. Or have all accepted a sedentary docile life of consumerism. So...you know like humans even with all our wit and IQ's and egos of those IQs. If a women shows more skin, or presents herself as more appealing, aka peacocking in the animal world. No matter who that man is, Einstein to the subway masturbator.  There will be a set of neurons and chemicals going off that, you this illusion that you call yourself will either, ultimately succumb, or you know hold that demon back one more time. This is scientifically proven in numerous data that can be found anywhere. Though ofcourse I am not expecting the normal dribble of folk online is a reflection of their actual stupidity.  I give the benefit of the doubt. Still though, it's chemistry. It's at a subconscious level. Same thing about me and how I get off same for them and what gets them off. Whatever gets us off. Will get us off. From the straightest of the straights to well, blegh pedophiles. It's not an excuse for them, ofcourse it is not. Just a fact.  So when the term asking for it is used this way in language, it is not to be confused with testimonials of rapists. But technically they are wired so wrong, in their heads their victims were. Which is based upon the simplistic desires amplified and out of control for them. However, whichever way you want to dress, dress, Idgaf i'm a damn tranny and I wrote this in daisy dukes and cut up leopard print tank. And I am definitely asking for it. Feminism-0 Me-999+
Why are his actions just now only coming to light
i love how john oliver can call out these motherfuckers how it is... and then cunts like jimmy kimmel can say they are not the moral conscience of america yet shit on donald trump every night and cant do the same with harvey weinstein.. i wonder what harvey weinstein did for him..... dont fall for all these tatics these hollywood motherfuckers are doing... having matt damon on his show coincidentally with all this shit going on to distract people.
What about Clooney and Damon?
She had gone through a lot at such a young age. I stan for this woman, she’s genuine, real, passionate, strong, brave, and more synonyms to describe this talented person. She’s winning this life, just look at her now from a Disney’s teen sensation, sweet darling to become a strong woman she is now. Such an inspiration! ❤️ Tell her I love her.
This is heartbreaking, I'm so proud of you! You've been through a lot but you kept Going and now you're here as an amazing powerful confident woman! I don't How I can say How proud i am💖 we, The Lovatics Will always support  you💪🏼❤️👑 staystrong💪🏼❤️💖💜💙💚💛🖤💘💋💝🎀 xxx Maylinn ❤️Lovatic❤️
I love u Demi and I loved every bit of this beautiful and inspirational documentary----  got a whole window of insight in ur life , and honestly u r one of the most passionate and venerable singers!! And I love ur music, and ur snippets of awesome music and covers made this documentary even more special!! Thank you Demi for giving us this amazing 1hr18min experience !!!!!!!!! Love ya😀❤️❤️😀😀👍🏼👍🏼
so inspirational, Demi, you are so strong and have inspired millions of people including me. I wish you all the best and thank you so much for sharing your story and giving hope to people and their families.
I would be awesome if this was called This is Real This is Me.
Loved this ♥️ the strength, honesty, courage it took to make this, so proud of her!
We are called survivors, we live to find belief and hope so we can make a difference! No one should be left behind! xxoo
love youu <3 <3 !!!! from romania for ever <3
This was fucking fantastic. I am a STAN.

THIS ONE HOUR DOCUMENTARY LEFT ME IN SHOOK. SO REAL AND HONEST. 😢
This was beautiful love you homegirl wish you the best, and more in life. 💞
Really Youtube!? Not even an english sub!? please. But I just loved to see how strong demi was and still be. love her!
I love you Demi! You're such an inspiration
what's the song at 1:03:16?
I really just sat here watching this for an hour and 18minutes after telling myself I wouldn't. Lol. This video makes me smile. Demi, you have so much support and people close to you that love you! You never needed our approval or acceptance to do what you want to do, sing what you want to sing, or to even have the body you have. It's your body! There IS NO right way to have one. I struggled with some of the same things you did to an extent. And I know first hand about struggling with food. I'm still learning that eating is an opportunity to fuel my body. And that food can be medicine if you eat the right kind. Thank you for sharing this video and your life with us. It's truly touched my heart! Just know that you don't have to ever impress us. People will love you for who you are. If you're good enough for you, that's all that matters. 😊 I hope this brought some sunshine to your day. You are never alone. The people in this video love you, your lovatics love you, I love you, God loves you! You are somebody all on your own. You have a purpose! -If you don't like something, change it. If you can't change it, change the way you think about it.
Great job Demi, keep up the strength to push forward and keep clean! You have been such a inspiration to many. 💞💕
'He's a nice dad. He not like my other dad...who....well you probably don't want to know. I mean, some of you probably do but...'\nI could literally feel my heart break
I'm so inlove with this ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is probably the best thing that I have watched in a very long time 🌹 you go Demi ✊🏾
Wow! So wonderful! Makes me love her even more!!
I wish selena was here to tell us about you and your frienship. Tbh.
Im amazed! Have so much respect for her after seeing that movie, it is not easy to be so honest with a whole world like that and i have never seen anyone, any celebrity doing that, and using their fame to such a good couse to tell their true story without censorship... Loved it and think I'll buy her new album too ;-)
i love you so much
Demi probably one of the most underrated singers but damn she deserves a lot more fucking credit! She has an amazing voice and can actually sing! I’m happy she still alive And is fighting her addiction cause the world needs more talented people like her!
Before watching this I really loved Demi. Now she just proved me right. I did not want this to end! That was just awesome and inspiring. <3
Why do I think the same Demi does about food 😳😩
I was never the biggest fan of demi, but now i fuckin am <3
This documentary must be recommended as therapeutic and inspirational for the people going through\nthe state of severe depression and anxiety.  Almost every human being experiences recurrent\nphases of depression and anxiety throughout the life from mild to life threatening!
Incredible, one of the most realest, honest and talented singers out there. I have massive respect for her.
Thank you. I love you!
25 minutes in.. she faked drugged test with others peoples pee? WHERE'D SHE GET IT FROM\n\n\ni still love u doe u like a frwend to me demi :D
Love her honesty💗 Still love Dilmer😭 they was cute as hell😭💗
It's unreal how much I cried watching this. Demi gave me strength to get through my struggles and realize that I needed to admit my issues and that it is okay to be vulnerable. I love her so much.
As soon as paramore started playing I was like WOOOOOO
I have no idea you were breaking down during the Give your heart a break era, omg I was so shocked. It was my favorite song, and those were my favorite era of you, coming back so strong that I didn't know you were at the peak. You have been through a lot, you struggled, and you made it Demi. You inspire people and give everyone of us power, hope in our life. You are amazing and I have no words. I watched it through the video and can't stop repeating the parts where you describe your time back then and all the emotions, situations you have to put up with. Thank you, for making amazing videos for us, Lovatics, for encouraging us, give us the power to be stronger. Keep on doing what you are doing, keep inspiring people, keep being honest about everything, keep sharing your experiences, we love you <3 I can't tell what am I feeling right now, I'm just in awe...Love from Vietnam <3
i love her so much
Relatable in so many ways... i cried.
Can we have subtitles for people who don't understand clearly english?
I love you Demi, thank you for being with me through your music since I was 10 and suffering from depression until now that I’m 20 and have learned so much about mental health through you. I’ll always look up to you because of how honest you have been about your journey. Thank you for sharing this 😘❤️
I view her soooo different now, wow just wow.
Omg...... you are amazing. .... thanks for sharing. It truly makes a difference!
Hey Demi! I'm so proud of you. You're perseverance and bravery is incredible. I'm so sorry you had to go through all of this, but you made the best out of everything, and your helping people too! You did not deserve the pain that you have been through. Remarkable to step up into the spotlight and be this vulnerable. This indeed is true strength in my opinion. It is the strongest kind of thing to try and become who you feel you are, and be okay with being alone in these discoveries or what people think too! Remember you don't have to be strong by yourself, although you want to. Perhaps you want to prove to yourself that you are an adult. However, adults need people too. Don't be afraid of allowing yourself to trust someone again! (You are so beautiful inside and out, and I'm so happy for you!) keep breaking down the stigma of mental health, and the feeling of loneliness. I've felt so lonely at many times in my life, and dealt with depression where I had to get professional help. I think it really is about having a hard time trusting people again once you feel so hurt by people in your life at such a young age. However, like you displayed one can begin to trust again, and most importantly learn to love yourself and others again! Forgive yourself for your past, it was out of your control even though you feel like you had choices, at such a young age with all of that pressure it was a fire you didn't walk into, but basically got thrown into. It's not your fault. Taking responsibility for your actions is important. But the pain done to you, then the media, mental illness, drugs, and all that pressure. How is a person supposed to handle that? They can't they break. But you came up like a skyscraper and it shows. You're a hero, and a role model. And an inspiration. Keep fighting, you help people. ❤️
This young woman is the reason why I was able to work up the courage to ask for help when I was struggling. She has done so much to advocate for mental illness and I can't thank Demi enough. Words cannot express how much I love and admire her and the person that she has become <3
Thank you for this, thank you for all. You're a warrior. You give me strength. You have a beautiful voice. I'm a Lovatic since more 10 years. I love love love your songs and what the lyrics means. ❤️
A beautiful women and strong... Demi wish u the best with everything...
Out of all this powerful documentary I loved how her stylist was excited to dress her for her dates. #theyneedtheirownshow#closethedealdress
I'm so proud of you Demi!! We know it's been a long and difficult road, but you've overcome everything and set an amazing example, you've taught us how to be warriors and never give up, even tho it's an never ending fight with ourselves, I've grown with you and your music, can't express enough how much it has helped me trough the years. Thanks for being an amazing person, hope one day i get the chance to meet you and see you perform again in my country Ecuador. Keep fighting and keep singing. Love you so much! <3
I mean.. Thank you! 🙏
This is amazing and HONEST!!!! I respected Demi but now I respect her even more. \nAnd please Demi and Wilmer Get married.
I want this cd with all the songs she sings on this documentary
@demilovato YOU ARE AMAZING! I loved that you shared your story with us, and even though you have been through so much in your life you are still one of the most amazing and beautiful soul full stars out there, you are still my most favorite and always will be, i love that you are so loving, caring and so down to earth.. you are the best Demi! much love from me to you with hugs
How could celebrities live with all these people around them, they turn them to a product not an artist.
I laughed I cried it was all incredible and amazing
This only makes me love you more Demi! Ugh  we'd be best friends 💜
God graces!!! Life of a celebrity is sooo damn tough😔
This was incredibly awesome and moving to watch. Hard to become a bigger fan but I am!!
*🎗💗🎗TO ALL MY WARRIORS  🎗💗🎗*\n \n_I LOVE YOU_\n \nWE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER\n \nAND WITHOUT *_YOU_* I WOULDNT BE HERE TODAY. \n\n*THANK YOU. 🙏🏻💕*
Such an inspiration. I love you Demi. My heart omg
I have never seen anything more inspiring and motivating in my whole life! Never imagined that two so different lives can have so much in common! Thank you Demi for sharing your story, your struggles and for opening up your soul to us! In less than two hours you have achieved something that I couldn’t do for myself all those years! You have make me feel stronger, more confident about my self and powerful! ❤️
on me for using... ¿? what does she says here on 20:02 ?
You got me making a dating app 🙃💖
I love you Demi, you've been an inspiration to me for years. Thank you for everything! Xx
I'm so fucking proud of you, Demi.
Ich love this woman so much❤️She's my idol. When I was down her music helped me.... Greetings from Germany Demi😘
demi and wilmer are for each other.
The “ask Taylor” story was definitely missing. Selena was a big part of Demi’s life. I am missing their friendship..
Loved it! Artists like Demi are the reason that I love to sing. Watching this just inspires me to be the best I can be and follow my dreams of becoming a singer!
Been a fan since the very beginning. You are such a beautiful soul, Demi. So so proud of you and so much love is radiating to you my girl💕
Oh my gosh Demi!!!! I feel this ways still for 4 years straight In school and I felt like the outcast cause I was bullied cause I wasn’t wearing a white T-shirt every day and a black skirt that was very short and I was fully because I wasn’t wearing nice Tory Burch is and I would wear my converse every day it all started in third grade I never was invited to birthday parties I was only find it one but I didn’t want to go because I felt like something that was gonna happen there someone always hanging over my shoulder and tell me that I’m not good enough I try so hard to keep my anger in and when I let it out I end up screaming and taking it out on the wrong person. They will get really upset but my family thinks that I’m kind on the outside but they don’t know when I’m feeling on the inside I just told them and they did it know they were surprised. I was always never comfortable telling them but now I’m comfortable telling anyone everything because of you. You made me a wonderful person and I’m still trying to control the anger even though now I do online school I still have money secrets that I haven’t told my parents about school. Thank you Demi so much for this document I love you so much
😭😭❤️❤️❤️🤘🏼🤘🏼

i'm obsessssssssss by this song and the video
Who's the girl playing with them?
Hmmmm🤔🤔🤔 not their best work. Will have to wait till more stuff comes out.
Why does Google say that Robert Smith died in 2001 when he's alive and well?
If you aint ever boshed acid for days and have never been convinced that you are telepathically communicating with an extra terrestrial intelligence via synchronicity your opinion on any of MGMT's music is neither valid nor relevant.
wow im stoked they still got it. this go hard.
fantastic return glad to have them back.
I love this the 80s vibe.
If this video doesn't get on trending then ill lose all respect for youtube... And humanity
I didn't know Visage were making a come back ?
Well, F@&*...  this was worth the wait
That moment, when Ben became the hot one.\nI don't understand, I always loved Robert Smith but um. No, Andrew. :-(
This is just so beautiful!
What’s this video mean
New wave... love it.
WELL...  THIS WAS UNEXPECTED!!!
Holy fuck, I thought they died.
Fruit Ninja's a lot more weird than I remember
Still coming out with some heat
Please tell me they're coming back! PLEASE!!! NEW STUFF!!
MGMT help you understand the different aspects and frequencies of this universe they know what's going on lol
I think I'm addicted to this song already.
Espere todo el año por lo nuevo de Mgmt y vaya si valdrá la pena
Like it. Love it. Gotta have it.

This is the most perfect time, i really needed this right now.
Not sure who these people are or how I got here, but im not dissapointed.
Their next single is “I need a Big Tiddy Goth gf”
Is Connan Mockasin in the video???
so much luv for this. it reminds of scisor sisters' invisible light video.
Great return! same feeling from the previous songs!
New album!?!?!?!? Or single?
Guys, I love this!
This is different. But I like it.

2017 has sido un año muy extraño para mi.
Wowoowowowowo tengo 10 años y algun dia bere a MGMT en vivo are lo que sea lo que sea lo que sea para que me lleben porque es mi banda de rock faborita \(o.o)/ wowowoow me morireee de emocion wowowo arriba MGMT :D
what a pile of shite
this song is shit, nowadays add a beat to any random lyrics and declare it art. disappointed!
And that's how babies are born
At 0:49 I was laughing cause it’s so fucking funny how el makes that disgusted sound and continues to slowly wipe that shit off onto her dress lmao I love her 😂💞
What did one wall say to the other wall?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet you at the corner once I'm done giving birth to this child.
Am I the only one getting getting some blcd sound effects here?
This is exactly how I came out of my mom’s vagina.
I have a feeling this is one of the first scènes of the new show....yessss you go girl!!!
Close your eyes while watching it
god i forgot how scary eleven was a times I LOVE HER!!!!!
I was biting my entire wrist watching this.
Never seen before clip... cos it hasn't been released yet millie lol
It's very rare to find a cast that works. Every single person who starred in this is fantastic. So I'm grateful to see another season. Only downside, if this continues to be great. The Duffer brother's can rip up their plans for an ONLY 4 season show, cos' this has the potential to go the full hog like 'Supernatural' has and Eric Kripke only planned that for 3-5 season's at most; now look at it. Yeah 'Stranger Things' is a cool show. Love it.
I love her hair so much
I want to ruffle her hair.
When she said in the mean time check out this.... her hand gesture reminded me of every granddad in the world.
look how Russian police tries to stop this man\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sgcDVIfoD0
I can’t wait to see mikes face when he sees 11 again
Me trying to come out
I am actually so excited!!!
Awww yes! Canny wait!!!! A wee catch up wi season one is at hand me thinks! Hmmmm.... *taps lips with forefinger* 😙
I have no words rn
Showed this to my mother, she said this was how i was born.
She's kind of annoying when out of character...
Mike, she’s still your date remember, she’s comingggg
E é nesse momento que vc fala, FODEU
Don’t let the predators get you Millie!!!! 😔
Anyone else think it was Tracey Beaker in the thumbnail

Glad I'm actually going there for the Friday
That was easier done then said...
I thought that was a boy with curly hair.
Omg omg so el and mike haven’t seen each other for probably almost a year and I can’t wait to see their reactions when they see each other. I’m crying
plz subscribe to pr and sentai rock as i am a newbie and subscribers thanks i'll subscribe to u if u subscribe to me
I literally CANT WAIT !!! It’s coming on the best day possible it’s the day before i go on holiday so I can download it and watch it on the plane 😆😆 IM LITERALLY WAITING TO SEE MIKES REACTION TO EL
There's no way this shit is keeping me from the snowball DAMN IT!
Same A.J Taylor\nI can't wait for season two
Yeah that hole in the wall doesn’t look like anything and certainly isn’t symbolic of rebirth...
her real accent annoys me for some reason...
watching the wall falls down and eleven goes out of the wall is so satisfying
SHE'S SO GREAT AND I'M SO HYPED AHH
I think this is supposed to symbolise a kind of rebirth for 11. that's why she came out of a big vagina.
Wow she's  British LOL.
I'm pretty sure they released this because it was 11 days until the release date lol
Can't wait for it to start, been looking forward to this.
Ahhhhh not to be a creep, but damn the Foley sounds for this are incredible. That release of air as the membrane bursts is super satisfying to the ears
Then the janitor walks by

Oh it's a girl.
I cannot wait for the sex scene with el and mike
Why are shows like this overhyped aF
GUYS PLEASE HELP ME OUT!!!!! Trying to make it into the music industry is so hard..... please take a look at my channel if you can.... it would really make my day!! 💜💜💜💜
MY QUEEN 11 IS BACK
I think that the demogorgon and eleven are the same things because in the game the two headed demogorgon is used as the monster where one head is good and other bad. So as eleven got out of the Upside Down the other half did too. In the end when El raised her hand the monster raised its hand too in the same way El did. \n\n\nAlso in the game the 7 headed snake thing might be a clue to what the monster is in season 2 😉\n\n(Just a theory😂)
when El was struggling to breathe, I was struggling to live. 😭 it hurt me physically. my poor baby!! She made it out safe, but my poor baby!!
Why does she have short hair while breaking out. Shouldn’t she have cutly hair now
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA LOOK AT THAT SMOL BEAM I WANNA FRAME HER UP IN MY WALL!
@everyone PEOPLE OF KEKISTAN! Our noble and supreme kekistan leader bigmantyrone has declared a meme jihad against boston SJW's. We must do our service and shitpost on every social media sight, and spread the word of kekistan. shadilay my friends. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Wers barbie?
Her hair is black not gray
So from what I can tell, El can create gates to go in and out of the upside down, or at least change them.
IS THAT A GIRL OR FAGGOT
The kiss blow at the end was kinda... weird... considering she's a really young kid\n\nNever change Hollywood?
A lot of people or going to use this as a template for their shitty intros. :\
Ooh, so is that what's happening inside my testicles.
My arse explodes like this after a curry 😂
That music always plays when two stars collide, its a fundamental rule of physics
Too short :/
I'm so confused.. are we gonna die or nah?
How is this trending??
I saw this live, was crazy.
I like how they had cameras there to capture it.
Who thought this was about that strange orange glow in england a couple days ago
since the two black holes last year, lost a significant amount of mass, due to producing so huge an amount of gravity wave distortion universe wide. several solar masses of energy was lost. the question, and I may have to figure it out myself, is, how much mass, over this length of time, 200 miles wide, was lost here. this would reduce the equation of state, because the end result may be much less than the 2.1 solar mass neutron star already seen.
No coments saying this is about god?
Just another nuclear bomb testing in north korea...
Watch this while listening to Neutron Star Collision by Muse
The aliens are coming!!
Lol all the simpletons saying the earth is flat XD
And that's how babies are made.
This is the magic of reality
Just pretend we knew what this meant and didn’t just think look at all the pretty colours
What dose the mean anyone?
well that's hot

I can already see this being used for shitty earrape  memes
*is there anything more beautiful in the world than this?*
The earth's flat
NASA is my space station
Have we entered a new era? An era of light and gravitational waves... An era of neutrons stars. Something we can now see that we couldn't detect before
Wake up SHEEPLE. The Earth is flat. There's no such thing as stars or gravity.
amazing sounds from space . just like a song
This video and description was much more entertaining than any so called news about Harvey Weinstein...
APOD 2017-10-16 _(»GW170817: A Spectacular Multi-Radiation Merger Event Detected«)_ sent me here. Cheers!
This is clearly a fidget spinner because the earth is flat
While most people worry about where the heavy elements originate from, relativity is no longer just a theory. It is now observed. We have many observations of time dilation due to gravity and now we can confirm having observed distance dilation due to gravity and only just now having been validated by the visible light of a kilanova. Relativity is here to stay. It's not just a theory anymore. Relativity is science fact.\n\nEnquanto a maioria das pessoas se preocupa de onde os elementos pesados ​​se originam, a relatividade não é mais apenas uma teoria. Agora é observado. Temos muitas observações de dilatação do tempo devido à gravidade e agora podemos confirmar ter observado a dilatação da distância devido à gravidade e apenas agora já foi validado pela luz visível de um kilanova. A relatividade está aqui para ficar. Não é mais uma teoria. A relatividade é um fato científico.
I knew that would happen........😂
gravitational waves were first predicted by Professor Albert Einstein.
Ooooohhhhhhh why couldn't it be longer.?  Great stuff\nWhat happens to the neutron stars?
Ain't no doomed neutron stars cos ain't no universe cos ain't no globe Earth.\n\nCome at me globalists.
in death we are most beautiful
They should have got Zack Snyder to direct this and Hans Zimmer to score it.
This has been reported several times and we are into the second wave now.. each wave of energy is thousands of times stronger than the last. Space weather is directly responsible for the earth pains.. Not man made global warming...Ask yourself, why did all the tarmacs and runways change there . Coordinates magnetic north has changed several years ago when you look at a fixed Compass it is a half hour off around the world our Earth is tilting on its axis these things are happening due to space weather and possibly an incoming binary star possibly a lot more things that are going on than you think they do not report on many things

Pienso que todo estos hechos son super lentos y nosotros lo vemos rápido...
This is really cool. I wish it had some type of 1 second=X years indicator to showcase the sped up timeframe.
The earth is flat
What a load of rubbish. Science FICTION
I don't believe gravitation waves travel at the speed of light... If they did the entire mass of the universe would be in constant collapse right after the big bang but studies prove this isn't the case...
The universe is electric. Stars, galaxies,  and planets are all formed through electromagnetism. Gravity in the sense the standard model (Relativity) presents it isn't real. If Einstein had been around for the direct empirical observations of stars forming like beads on a string in extreme high current filaments then his idea of gravity would have been much different. But now it is dogma, and physics has lost its way so so badly.
Shitty video. Quartz did a better ome on the subject lol
Space is amazing
Is this a trailer for Sonic Mania? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njk im not dumb
The flat is earth.
REVEAL THE TRUTH ABOUT ALIENS NASA!!
From a non astronomer. If this stars are 100 million light years away does that mean it happened 100 mil years ago and the light is only reaching us now? Do not understand how they are getting sound and light at same time.
i got a qeustion correct me if I'm wrong in the 1970s we launched deep space satellite voyager 2 and i know there was a interstellar map of the location of earth with the two neutron stars now gone is the map now out of date?
i must say  Gravitational waves in the context put forth here are a clumsy  derivation of physical the  phenomenon gravitation,   gravitational waves whilst claiming to intercepting waves of hundreds to millions  of  miles in  frequency  length @ distances and time scale of hundreds of and even billions+ light years ,,  the detector is unable to show the  physical   phenomenon of earth moon sun tidal distortion  ,which according to theories of gravity generate heat(not electrical induction?) in the earth  by distortion of the entire body of the earth  a wave function of the proportional to tidal movements and spherical diameter of the earth , larger at the equator diminishing to the poles  , on the plan of the rotation of the body's,
Song ?
Imagine if NASA had the Military budget... the things they could do!
Somebody had to sit down with a video designer and explain what happens for visual effects, just let that sink in.
Rip headphone users
This occurred millions of years ago, but it took the light and the waves all those millions of years to reach Earth. Is that correct?
when can we hear the rendered sound it actually makes?
Why are people so excited over this speculative simulation. Relax it is not real.
*2045 fidget spinner*
I recall Brian Cox  theorising that the energy produced from this collision will scorch the earth, and that’s how the world will end
a time stamp would be nice so I get an idea of how long something like this takes, nice video though
It’s pretty cool we got a talk from the people who detected it a week before
Question, Animation shows each neutron star releasing gravitational ways before the merger, how is this possible? Aren't gravitational waves only released after the merger? Due to all that mass collapsing onto itself? @NASA
Can someone explain to me how they just happened to find this when it's 130 million light years away? 130 million light years means it happened 130 million years ago. So they just got super super ultra ridiculously unbelievable unfathomably rarely lucky to find this event that took an earth week to happen but occurred 130 million years ago 130 million light years away and NASA just so happened to have multiple instruments all pointed at the exact same event even though they did not the know about what it was until after they got the radiation and light measurements. Can anyone explain that?
how are you able to detect these signals (gravitational pulls I think) and what does this mean for the future?
There is no space we live in a box
Fuck athiests
Was very pretty now what is actually going on????
Morrissey is washed up. He's made some of my favourite music of all time, but the occasional half decent pop song is a mere scratch on the poetic masterpieces he used to produce.
Voice as strong as ever
Yes!, love it, So simple yet true. Im staying in bed.
Desert like religion resolution recommendation article catch detect grant remind attempt.
He's not wearing his supreme photo shirt. Lame lol
The older gentlemen.  What can you say. Legitimate !
Sorry!! but when Fan Video's become more interesting than the so called real thing!! MORRISSEY..  Where's your imagination Gone?.
This song gets better with every listen and the lyrics are genius as always.
Golden voice, golden writing. Its like he's never changed
Please tell me you're also worry about Morrissey been on a chair or a wheelchair THE WHOLE VIDEO.
Did his magic again
Thanks, you've just made my morning better :')
This is something special. An amazing song with a great message. Love it! Good to see Morrissey again.
Simple but good. I like this shit
I love him more than this video, Moz has grown old. Still the song is great!
hmm can some of you stop begging for a Smiths reunion... it was good while it lasted and you won't always get what you want, that's just life. if you really loved The Smiths you would respect their decision of growing apart, and at least they'll always have timeless tracks. great tune by Moz!!
Isn’t this the guy on that Supreme shirt
I think the beat got in the way of his amazing voice. But otherwise he offers something new and unique. He's always been the on that surprises people. Rate 8
Well, know we know what Joey Barton has been up to since being banned.....
I can't wait to go see him in Denver next month!
moz is good\ncoz he's in mood
Great but underrated artist. Such a shame. Morrissey is amazing
Reminds me of a Romulan.\nAnyways. For Melanie West.
I 100% Agreed to this song.
Get off the stage, you silly old man. \nThe music is Cathy Dennisesque. \nThe video is fucking rubbish. \nThank-you for everything, Morrissey. \nNow you mean nothing.\nIt's a shame he didn't spend the day in bed instead of recording this shite.
The beginning with the wheelchair is like watching one of the newer live videos.\n\nOh wait, he stands up in those.\n\nImagine the set.  Morrissey shows up and does the first take.  The director says great, we got most of the blocking down.  Stay in the same general area you were in the previous take.  Morrissey frowns and says, That wasn't it?  Fetch me a chair.
Morrissey always making great ideias, he is a good man.
awe Morrissey is a cute old man
May he conscious hiphop in this new song?
I started listening to The Smiths in 1984, when I was 14 and stopped listening to Morrissey right after Bona Drag. This vid popped up as trending on YouTube. One word: creepy.
Can he stop lmao. This is lame asf he should just retire and stop being a tool
Where's the bed?
Well.... why do I love Morrissey's music so much? And why does he lead me to such a different world, where dreams become reality?
oh Morrissey 😍 you didn't let me down. powerful lyrics ! they got me !
Love! Love! Love! ❤️ So happy to hear this lovely voice again in something new.
I found it painful to see Morrissey in a wheelchair
Nice to see the Divine David again
Why is he on a wheelchair? I think I'm the only one that didn't get it
LEGEND..back with to save us all.
morrissey staring directly into my eyes while im just trying to take a shit
Seeing him old makes me sad. It's inevitable but still hurts. His voice sounds different too.
Woah, Never seen so many old people in the YouTube comment section.
You couldn't have posted this at a better time ❤ having alot of stress over college work
Quanto tempo espera algo de Mozz❤️❤️❤️\nA música, o clipe está fantástico!!!
Who's the crazy dude with the  Bowie ,Ziggy Life On Mars' make up on?
Should of gone to Ikea.... and bought a bed.
Give the Oscar to Joey Barton, best supporting actor
Not gonna lie, I thought I would hate this but he has my heart again!!  😍😍
Love him, love the dark comical side of this with the wheelchair- especially when they were tossing him around the room in it. To age in the limelight...
Didn't think Morrissey was one to get his chest waxed but there you go. Good tune though.
I would sing all day and night if i had a voice as good as his love it Morrissey!
Low in High School. Man this guy old to singing bout that. Move on Moz.
Desperate come back just suits you
Even if I spent 2004 listening to Morrissey in my car \nI'm better off alone than I would be in your arms!
he's getting old :'(
I'm loving it!
The love of my life is back.
Amazing  lyrics!!! LOOOOVE THE WORDS,AS IT'S SUCH A REFLECTION OF MY LIFE ,AND THE MESSAGE THAT THE News channels can be destructive, is on point!!! Love this song!!!

If you live long enough folks make sure you have a dwade to your LeBron James.
Lebron is a bitch and Wade is a bitch too. Fuck Lebron...suck some shit you bitches! Sounds like she is interviewing a gay couple.
I don’t know about y’all, but jelly on toast w/o the peanut butter is delicious. You can DEFINITELY have a jelly-only sandwich, D.Wade. Also, LeBron, if your peanut butter is dry, you’re not doing it right LOL. Great interview, Rachel!
Retire. Give young men a chance to play
I want them to have sex.
james is an idiot and is judgmental towards whites.
Im not homophobic or have anything against these two, but this shit is gay af.
Who cares?! Why is ESPN making such a big deal about Wade going to Cleveland?
Please use better reporter next time. Rachel not the worst but shes so far from the best.
No wonder LeBron James is not very bright -- he never went to college!  But he should be smarter than he is, bec he graduated from a Catholic high school.
Can some of you guys subscribe to my channel and get me to 200 plz
Wade dodges that question from her like a pro by asking another question XD @ 4:44
GREAT BENEFITS , EXTRA CASH , have a look http://www.grabmca.com/16381207-2/
dam dwayn wade is LeBron James litte bitch he actually leaf Chicago to go to Cleveland just to be with LeBron wow wade shows the world that your really LeBron bitch
i dead love cursing Lebron for some reason its amusing
The Land came from defend the land in 16 being down 3-1 if I'm not mistaking.
Dynamic duo right here ladies and gentlemen
Rachel is looking a little more thick right??
I got beats on my channel swing by if u need em!
You can tell it’s a real friendship, because of how much credit Wade gave Bron in the peanut butter and jelly question
The most famous player in the NBA uses Pandora with ads....
Forget all this friendship stuff like just be ready to make it to the finals and beat whoever come out the West, come on LeBron I want you to get four rings
LeBron is a race baiting liar, there was no hate crime LeBron you piece of shit.
Fuck you all, take the knee my ass.
D Wade a ball licker a clown a sell out fuck him stay of Robbins Illinois
Dear JR Smith (My Swishy). This letter is oh soo tough to write. What we had was real. Hell we won a championship! It feels so long ago. We broke bred together as brothers. Good times. You do mean a lot to me. I don't want this to be personal but Wade has come back and hes just better. At everything. He runs better moves better and laughs at all my jokes. Its just facts JR. You know I helped you through that whole attitude adjustment thing. But I am the King of the Land and my  Wade makes a better queen.
Sellout to the Democratic party
The Land baby.  It’s 216 ....216  Dude that’s cleveland now you know it.
These two have me dead every time 😂
The Kid will win both of you guys in eastern conference finals. You'll give him more respect!
I like that interview
Even tho I hate the Cavs they will be entertaining this year
He still call my man the kid
I love seeing lebron with wade. They are just better on and off the court together
This was just a dope interview.
This looks like the beginning of a  brazzers video
I don't pay for apps, I still got Pandora with the ads, you gotta love that!
D-Wade for sure Jelly with those knees💀💀
Why are lebrons mannerisms like that of a fag
These niggas be like little kids playing together and being best friends and shit
Dwayne don't put yourself down, you're peanut butter!
Y is she correcting him saying fight for the kids to make it sound nice? No
If LeBron Peanut Butter and Wade Jelly, then Bosh is the whole wheat bread.
lebron real af in this interview.

too bad Kyrie didn't stick to him
Am I supposed to worship those coons because they can dribble a basketball? And why do they always have some white broad interviewing them?
Why do you talk so much shit on Kyrie, LeBron? Respect the man's decision. You're being a diva and DWade looks uncomfortable as FUCK
Their relationship is GOLD! 💛
Right after last NBA season I saw Dwyane Wade with Gabrielle at a restaurant in Miami, and as he was leaving I asked for a photo and he said no... Good dude

Don't let this distract from the fact LeBron James had to leave an NBA finals game against the Spurs because of a leg cramp!
Fake sports news
Wades hair looks great!
Gayinthenba
Love the rust coat!
It’s nice 10 years later and you and Chuck Bass are still going strong 😂😘
Would love for Guy to add his OOTN/OOTD's whenever he is in your vlogs, if that is okay with you two 🙂😘 He always dresses so sharp! 🙂💕
Honestly Amelia, when I see how amazing your style has become in comparison to your counterparts, I truly wish your Instagram focused more on your outfits rather than your surroundings. It looks too much like a travel/explorer/globe trotter Instagram and not enough like a fashion forward one. You buy often and there is also a lot of stuff that we would buy just from your outfits, which is what sharing your passion is about, right? it just seems like a better sharing platform to make your Instagram more about you rather than the places or surroundings. Does it makes sense? Hope so! xx
Love the fringe. Love the turban. Love the dress. Love the skirt. Love the jumpsuit. Love Duke. You and Guy should date :D
Can you please do an eye creme recommendation video? :)
Dress length beautiful :-)
Another pointless female video.
OMG I think the fringe was literally made for you🙌🏼😻Looks sooo freaking amazing.
Love that headband on you!!
Seeing Duke scuttling down your hallway 😍 What a doll
More vital work on behalf of humanity.
It's so super cute.How is Duke. You really always look so cute.Good for you 🐶
When Amelia and guy finally go out being in love, I will say 'I TOLD YOU!'
Can you link your earrings?? I love your taste and I always try to look for them after watching your videos ❤️
Any new youtubers? 👋🏽 subscribe to my channel new content coming real soon!
Real question: as a style blogger, how do you keep your closets cleaned out? How do you not run out of space?
Wow that black jump suit looks so great and sexy on you!! In love with that rusty red coat as well xx
Dunno what on earth you talked about.. but you are v. cute.
Does anyone know were the rug is from?😍
Welcome to the epitome of the modern female...
This is just another example of everything that is wrong with western society.
Why the actual fuck is this 6th on trending

not
Fringe suit so well xx
omg duke!!
Poor Duke!!!
I LOVEEEE your haircut Amelia!!
7:13 gives me Estee fashun vibes
I really love the night out outfit, and the new haircut, you look gorgeous ^^ - Love from France, Célia
Proportion wise, shorten it for not over 5 cm. Dress will be still long enough, and princesslike, maybe just altered better for your height. But it needs to be a little bit shortened
I keep pausing this vlog to leave comments lol: I actually do like the fringe/headband thing and also really like the skirt and cardi paired with the grey-ish jumper! It gives it a nice contrast whilst stlll being neutral. Pairing it with a cream color jumper might end up a bit matchy looking. I love love love all your autumnal purchases!
Just love your style and taste of clothing.
Dress length is absolutely fine. I've never done this before, but I went straight and ordered that bag as it looks so gorgeous! A good alternative doe the Gucci Marmont. Xx
The fringe is gorgeous !
Love this 💕💕💕
I need the cape from J Crew in my life! Love your blogs too much!! \nHope Duke is feeling more like himself xxx
U look so on fleek :))
Amelia you need to get duke a ProCollar. I don’t know if you have them in the UK but basically it’s an inflatable donut type thing that goes around their neck. It keeps them from being able to lick their wounds but they are still able to eat/drink with it on. I think maybe my vet called it an inflatable e collar so try checking for that so duke won’t be so sad and sulk!!
Those Manolos ❣️❣️❣️ and you've got really good legs too, so the heels will go with just about anything in your gorgeous wardrobe. X
Love all the clothes you bought.. and the lipstick you wore, what is it? 😍
Does anyone know the link to the black dress she’s wearing beginning of video? X
Amelia dresses always looks stunning.. this mens no bad just keep it up! We get the style and it so suits you🙂 good way!  Love the new hair too! You look so cute..
aweee poor sweet Duke..i totally love his cute self
Obsessed with your fringe!!!!
What lipstick are you wearing?
Love the frenchss❤️❤️❤️❤️
HEY GUYS IVE JUST STARTED VLOGGING ON YT, CHECK MY VIDEOS OUT ON MY CHANNEL!!!!!! XOXOX
Pretty but so young.
my friend has the malono in blue she said they were uncomfortable  any ideas to make her comfy
Why is this on trending
Your fringe has definitely bought your wardrobe game up. Everything looks so chic on you now.
Amelia, my boy has just had an op. He does not like the cone so the vet gave him a vest to wear that fastens with poppers underneath. It has been the best thing ever!
Actually I think the dress and the shoes you had go together really well, it's different, and it wouldn't be everybody's taste but I like it a lot!
I’m a university student and can barely afford granola bars so I am and will continue to live through you 😍
They make soft cones that are more comfortable ... we have one for our dog by Kong via Amazon
Those shoes are the ones Big proposes to Carrie with in the Sex & the City Movie!!! That’s literally all I can think of whenever I see you wearing them.
I absolutely love your style! The way you dress is so me. Can you please do a Look for Less video on some of your outfits? I love so many of your outfits but I can’t afford a $300+ outfit.
I get the pro collar for my dogs rather than that plastic cone. It looks like an inflatable neck pillow or life jacket.
The H&M skirt, chunky cardi, turtleneck combo is my fave, looks gorgeous on you! xxx
Clothes at 8.40
Amelia your bangs look amazing! :)
Awwww Duke-y sorry about the cone. But your mummy loves you and wants you to be healthy.💖
I think get the dress a little shorter, it's an awkward length.  And the pink band is alright, not that cute. Your hair looks better without it  lots of love
Yesss to the soft head accessory 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 looks good on you!
Where’s David? It’s been so long since we saw him last!
Love everything you’ve shown including the hair turban ❤️
Petrol is called Gas in USA
I'm so obsessed with your style! I love when hauls are a part of your vlogs! <3
J.crew in the states does alterations for their customers
I would shorten your dress to the same length as the Pleated Skirt you bought online 💜
I love the dress the length it is and your hair is beautiful with the fringe a/k/a bangs in the US 😉👌  Love this video and Cone...ohmygosh he's so adorable!❤🌸
Love the length of the dress and the headband is super cute on you!
Wow I am obsessed with that maroon jacket.
Can Guy please make his own Youtube channel???
I'd love a video of you showing how you upkeep your fringe between washes and how you style them after:D they look so nice! xxo
Hahaha, this is that point of the night where I want to be in my house with my dog, literally, story of my life when I go out sometimes
I love Guy, Duke and.....retail therapy of course !
No, no, no.  Don't shorten it.  It looks wonderful on you at that length.
The SHOES though! Love them! They remind me of the Manolos Mr Big proposes to Carrie with :P
Your enthusiasm makes me so happy and in a good mood, take care Amelia 😘
Guy is so dreamy omg
I guess youtube is broken for this to be on trending
“Petrol” is so much classier than “gas” 😅
i love your bangs!!! I love that pleated skirt!
I will forever Ship you Amelia with Guy no matter what 😢😍😍😍
Ugh Amelia, your videos always end up destroying my bank account :'( Also, what are you wearing on your lips? It's gorgeous.
My dog had the same thing previously and I used this cone.  :)  They can lie down a bit more comfortably!  \nhttps://www.amazon.com/Recovery-Collar-All-Four-Paws/dp/B002MVURV2/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1508198150&sr=8-3&keywords=soft+cone+for+dogs
what happened to your dog ???...a big kiss for him
Not cute - Looks like you're going to do some cleaning!! Dress length is great though!
Why does Duke have to wear that cone for gland squeezing?
I love your hair! Everytime i see it i'm tempted to get bangs/fringe myself. The straight w/bangs look makes anything you style look more editorial high fashion. Petrol (UK) is Gasoline (Gas in US).
Hi Amelia, my dog just got neutered & hated the cone, he would not move & cried all the time, so I bought him one of those small diapers & put it on him, he was much better and could not lick his wound.  It worked for me, so it's worth a try.  I would only put it on him when I could not watch him.  It's worth a try :)
Your voice is so irritating
Where is duke? Or is cony = duke?
Worse than  QVC. Fuck off.
AMELIA!!! I remember you talking about be boob tape, not the normal tape the one that you can scoop and lift them up with 😂can you let me know where to get some??? Please! Haha! Random comment!xx
I got that jcrew skirt as well and I'm usually a 6 but wear a 2 in it! I told the sales lady that it was vanity sizing at its finest because I haven't worn a two since high school 😂

For everyone to know *this video is from 2012*
Someone explain why this is trending? I know about that cunt and everything he’s done, but why exactly is THIS trending?
Storm Ophelia just blew the roof of my local football (soccer) pitch!
All these celebrities that have been SOOO full of virtue were ALL complicit with the sexual deviancy of Holywood. They all knew what was going on and did nothing until someone else had the balls to speak up. Actors and musicians = Hypocrites! ...Golywood is DEAD to me now.
Number one on trending in UK is a fat pervert standing next to a road talking to two women........fantastic
if body language is anything to go by shes incredibly aroused &displaying sexual interest in a) Weinstein.. or b) the tall black bodyguard behind him\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor her sake i hope its the bodyguard :/
Must be true then I mean what’s not to believe when its coming from an ex junkie who was probably of her face at the time.
This video shows nothing incriminating, just Harvey looking like a creepy old man
0:54 - Damn that hug just screams desperation. So this basically proves most actresses prostitute themselves to rich producers just to get famous! \n\nHOLLYWOOD IS FULL OF GOLD DIGGING SLUTS JUST READY FOR THE CHANCE TO FUCK AND SUCK THEIR WAY TO THE TOP!
Wow he definitely did all those bad things people say! I mean look at this woman trying to escape his rapist grasp
Alot more harvey shitstains still out there, they must be pulling some serious favours with the media tycoon's, who of course are also upto no good, so much for the media lmao,The  Lamestream Media's day's are numbered.
I don't condone sexual abuse in any form, but why do all these women attack him now? Seems so opportunistic, he is a bag of dung well and truly but really are they any better than him for keeping this a secret for so long?
Y’all know this clip is from 2012 right? Before any of Weinstein’s victims came out about any of the abuse? It’s really sad seeing all these people in the comments talking shit about Jessica, especially since it was BEFORE the allegations.
FFS SHE IS LITERALLY SMILING AND LAUGHING WHAT IS WRONG IN THAT OMG IT WAS IN 2012 TOOOOOO
The only reason an attractive woman would ever touch or flirt with a fat and disgusting man is if she's after his money.\n\n\n\nI know this from experience.
Paedophile who travelled from Southall to Slough to meet a 13 year old girl is caught...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqD2CDI84z8
HARVEY THE DOUCHEBAG GOT AWAY WITH ALL THIS STUFF FOR SO LONG. I BET HE SAID SOMETHING TO UPSET THE ZIONISTS WHO CONTROL HOLLYWOOD SO THEY HAVE EXPOSED HIM TO RUIN HIM. WHAT GOES AOUND COMES AROUND, THATS JUSTICE. HE WAS SCREWING PEOPLE THAT DIDNT WANT IT, NOW HE IS GETTING SCREWED AND DOESNT WANT IT
Why is this on trending if it was uploaded over 5 years ago?
GUYS THIS VID IS FROM 2012
This is fucking old I'm Suprised That this is Trending
A lot of women gained their fame by being nice.. their Masters didn't mean it would be a 1 time deal though.\n#GoodOleDays
OMG fuck off with this shit it's all over the news we don't need it to be trending we get it! he's a bad person! sick of hearing about this guy.
How is this 1st in trending
He’s good \nBut he’s not quite jimmy savile
Yeah but when was this?
Any context? When was this filmed?
Okay this guy abused his power no doubt but got laugh at the sluts who willingly gave him what he wanted to not risk damaging their career. Obviously their dignity and self respect went out the window with some of them

Hos still want the Weinstein weiner guess it doesn't matter what you do as long as you're rich enough
God, Jessica is all bullshit, she's so hypocrite. My respect for courtney, she has the face of I don't wanna be here . But in the end of the day, she was there, so, her fault too.
How old is this though
YouTube's algorithm is awful. This should not be trending
Harvey Weinstein may be an asshole but all those hollywood actresses are just lying fakes. They literally whore themselves for a role.\nOf course not they act all outraged on twitter because the dude served his purpose.\n\nFAKE WHORES.
Can not judge what happened by watching this.
Hollywood whores will suck a small, circumcised kike cock for a role but cry rape when it suits them.\n\nHarvey Cum Shot for the Plant Pot Weinstein did nothing wrong even though he's a nasty kike.
Have to be honest here, Jessica Chastain  is extremely over-rated as an actress & for a shit actress she is in so many big budget Hollywood films & as the open secrets in Hollywood are coming out on a daily basis, I can see how she has been cast in so many films, the mattress on her back helps, hence the uninvited hug for Weinstein.
Dont watch this video .... \nI repeat its a trap. Dont watch this video\nhttps://youtu.be/W7GY8HPG-pc
YouTube is a shit platform
It's easy with all the women claim to be molested by Weinstein: you fuck me, you make me famous. That was the deal. Now they feel regret and claim sexual abuse. Gimme a fucking break. I hope the entire dregs get pulled up. Destroy Hollywood
Looks like he’s landed a 4some by promising lead roles for all of them #mogulpaedophile
why the hell 5 yo video is trending? wtf, YT broken again/still?

Pot calling the kettle black these dirty Hollywood perverts don't no if they are coming or going.that also includes these actresses coming forward where were you when he first did somthing why not go to the police like a normal person. You chose not to because you sold your self . Now when your other pervert masters have gone sour with Weinstein they have asked all the perverted actresses to step in all the same thing a bunch of dirty sexual preditors and hoes
I hate drump supporters they do shit like harvey weinstein did(rape women).. its cus of trumps attitude for women grab them by the pussy and how they can get away with this sh*t because they are rich. disgusting
video was too long. Halfway through it, I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix my self a sandwich. But then I found out that I'm out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I'm really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I'm a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she'll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she's the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can't sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can't take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she's sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what's up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video. She said, you know what, I've been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer. So we opened that drawer, and lo and behold, there's my phone and this video still has two minutes of play time on it.
What's the point in this? Like he's surrounded by women. Omg what a sinner
Why is this trending. Nothing happens, its just some people standing around...Fucking great!

#HarveyWeinsteinIsOverParty
The CIA is using this Weinstein drama to cover up Vegas.
Gross. Harvey may have raped some women, but think about the hundreds actresses who whored themselves out for movie roles and fame. Hollywood is so disgusting.
Now it makes you wonder did these actresses get to the top from their talent of acting or talent of sucking cock... 🤔🙈
So that's how Jessica Chastian climbed up the hollywood ladder
I'm an Arsenal fan with a new channel so if any of you have time to check out my vids I'd appreciate it so much 🙏🏽 (Remember to sub if you enjoy! 💪🏽)
Fail to prepare, prepare to fail
ozil is demanding big money, to compensate for the lack of ambition of the club.
I'm not a arsenal fan but dt makes this channel very interesting
Chill out..lol..its only football..well not in Arsenals world.😎
Hit the nail on the head. Major underlying problems. You can't polish a turd
Ozil must go,he is a complete shit
Arsenal should be added to 1000 ways to die.
DT was stupid. ....no player misses deliberately. ...get a grip and stop defending ozil
Thats too strong, thats too strong Robbie SHFU DT!! Ozil is overrated and let the fans down. He does not care! I agree Wenger, Kroenke, Gazidis and so on are the main problem. Instead of buying Ozil, they should have pushed for Higuain. But, Arsene is indecisive and as soon as another club competes for a player, he buckles! We gave in to Napoli for a measley 2 mil. pounds. Then he should have used the buy back clause to get Cesc back the following season. Cesc is way better than Ozil in my opinion, and I have been saying this for years! I was saying during the Watford game, please do not let Ozil enter the pitch, bring on Wilshere who is hungry! I also felt he should have sold Sanchez as he does want to be at the club, but Wenger is clueless and undecisive. This goes much deeper than the issues I have portrayed and we have to put up with at least 2 more seasons with Wenger :(
Man City is slapping things up cause they make it rain cash on that cash club, what ya expect?
arsenal fantv is more entertaining than their games
Robbie if you ask a question then have the decency to let the other person answer, stop cutting them short
Watford played well, they got lucky. They added new players and they only recently become a decent side. I give em respect
A major problem is this strange accent that seems to be prevalent across the UK. What happened to regional dialects?
Ozil missed is not that dramatic. Players like messi , ronaldo missed easier situation like those very often.  Agree with DT , letting fans down is a word too harsh to use.
It's more offside than your belly!
Love the way DT shut that mug up lol.
‘We’re a top 6 team’ shut up😂😂😂😂😂😂
I wish I was as tough as DT he's so dangerous
I feel bad for Sanchez and Özil, they deserve to play in a better team. They are world class players
ha ha ha ha ha he comes from luton  why ent he sayin fam and blood anymore non stop i thought he was from jamaica the other week
This guy is such a mug
BMT HE DOES NEED TO STOP TAKING LACAZETTE OFF AFTER 65 MINUTES, ITS SO JARRING, LET HIM FINISH THE GAME
Tell me how this guy actaully had some pretty good points and then he brought up Arse Wenger
Fat Robbie he always put the blame Ozil for arsenal lost thanks DT for defending Ozil
DT just imagine how good it is to be a tim winning every single week fucken amazing also up the ra🇮🇪🇮🇪
Canadian mass sensitive opinion demonstrate wisdom report historically necessity.
Why does he think Ozil is really good at the moment he's doing shit
This guy needs to learn how to direct his aggression!
this shameless creature called robbie my name is desperate larry no no bob smith
Subscriber to me if you want arsene Wenger to be sacked
DT is the only one who is level headed enough not to blame Ozil for missing his chance.
Not only Watford laughing at the Arse.Ffs...just fukin accept you ain't all that and believe me you won't get soooo carried away with your shite performances and lack of bollocks in your team.\nThis is not a dig at your club, just a statement of fact.\nI'm west ham...I know we're shite so I'm never suprised when we put in shite performances on the pitch.\nIt's like England FC,Does anybody seriously believe we'll win the WC next year?\nNo?Why?Cos we know we ain't good enough.Iceland ffs.\nSo don't get suprised when a good Watford team who never say die roll you over.\nRing Ring....reality calling.
Surely I'm not the only one that has watched this for over 3 times
His from Luton and support arsenal lol wt mug
Emre Can in the background
I'm glad the fa banned the Watfords player for diving. A nice 3 game ban
Lmao after so much shit talking ozil's miss I went to see it. It's a common damn miss. World class players miss chances like that very often. Arsenal's problem is that they have very few chances like that, so whenever someone misses, it's a freaking tragedy.
I hate arsenal and one day I will take over the world and make all of you work In a death camp
gobshite
THIS FAT TRAMP THINKS HES HARD LOL
He speaks alot of sense tbf
Man's from Luton. Proper stinky gypo!
Blah, blah, blah, arsenal will win the f.a cup, and europa this season, and you will still be bitchin, what more you lot want,
It's not just Wenger, It's Ozil, and every other player on that team. All garbage, Sanchez playing like garbage on purpose because he's stuck in a trash can of a club. complete overhaul needed.
The thing about Arsenal is there to flat, they need to use there big name players to attract more talent. That’s why Arsenal need to spend yeah Lacazette decent but is he really going to attract world class players? Cause the CL looks miles away now
To be fair its not just Watford fans who are laughing at you hahahaha Muppets.
#4 on trending. Robbie is laughing his head off haha
How can someone be so evil... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo22Al8H7GU
Amir kahn in the background
So what is an arsenal fan. I don't think I have ever seen a real arsenal fan. They diss there own club
what is this role reversal at the start\n\ndt defending players robbie going hard\n\nwat
Not sure why this is such a surprise!, said last season, pre-season and the start of this season Arsenal will be a mid-table club by the end of the season, possibly lower than 10th!...nothing has changed or will change!..which is good as I can't stand Arsenal, but I am been impartial in this, as a football fan of 41 years its easy to spot those clubs and the teams they have who is serious about winning leagues and European trophies and Arsenal are nowhere near that level and have slipped down the pecking order for the years now.\nSanchez and Ozil will be off on a free, possibly more will follow, Arsenal will not get European football next season and this will not attract big players but Sanchez and Ozil, they will l leave and suddenly they will be the world class players they are meant to be at another club, because Arsenal is an easy club to play for, the players are wrapped in cotton wool, they can under perform without the fear of being dropped from the team, paid a decent wage for doing nothing to earn the money as the fans keep paying more and more for season tickets because they won't say enough is enough...
2:05 \n\nWhat a roast. Take a bow son. Take a bow.
#2 on trending? Arsenal Fan TV is amazing, i've been watching robbie for like 4 years
I love this guy
I love the fact that this jumped up knob has a constant idea on how Arsenal should perform, if he knew that much about tactics and managerial decisions why is he on a parody YouTube channel? 🤔
This DT Guy was born angry.
Hahahahahahaha Arsenal suck spurs rule !!!!!!

DT keeps saying deliberate miss...FFS !! no miss is a deliberate miss....its not like every once in a while a player 1v1 with keeper goes tell ya what, imma try and hit goalie's chest this time
Also you are always very disrespectful to Robbie, you wouldnt be shit without the big man dont forget that Dick Taster
Lol this bloke talking is such a bell end 😂😂 Ju'nart I mean?
hahahahah look at that self loathing wigger.  Must be awful being a minority amongst 3rd world animals
DT says I'm from Luton...so why do you support Arse Nil then? Support your local team, would call him a Glory supporter but this is Arse Nil we talking about
Arsenal are the best
Elneny played like crap. Iwobi was misplacing passes left and right. Wenger made questionable subs and team decisions. Xhaka was picking his nose as Cleverely buries the winning goal for Watford. \n\nBut blame the loss on Ozil for the chance that he missed (which was not a miss, it was saved). Seriously, the hate that he gets from the fans is beyond comprehension. He created two chances, that's nothing now?  \n\nHonestly, if Ozil went somewhere and shows the quality that he has that is underappreciated and mismanaged at Arsenal, I would like to see the look of these lots faces then.
Hi, i am a new fifa 18 youtube gamer, fifa 18 and i'm trying to grow my youtube channel SUBSCRIBE!
Arsenal. Arse nil.  Lol
Sub plz
We got lots of underlying problems and özil is one of them
Dt public protests banners planes will never solve the problem.mass pitch invasion needed kroenke out first then wenger then transition period.he will sign another contract after 2 years remember what I said
This guy should concentrate on having a wash then cry about football you tramp
Trying to reach 20k views I’m on 17k please help,me get views by watching my videos please 😆😆

Wow the most meaningless comments get the highest upvotes here (like noo and shit etc)\nJheez
Which linux distro or desktop environment he is using. It doesn't seems like Kali or may be Kali with another Desktop environment?
Oh shit this is a real problem
Does anyone know what distro of Linux this is? #cheers
for all the people saying wpa2 is dead. ALL the kracks attacks on linux can be patched right now. so the only victim left are android devices and i think they will be patched soon. so wpa2 is not dead yet.
Whats version Linux in video ? Please!
i know that for a long time. fuck you for share that information
I don't have WiFi anymore, got an unlimited 4G data plan
Nice. Now they need to release their exploit or someone else will do it.
i think its fine
So what im i suppose to update and where?
I lost it when this guy knows soooo much about computer security but still uses Simple Screen Recorder LMAOO
its cool and at the same time scary for me who uses a custom rom
OLD NEWS. Get with the times
By 'updating your devices' what does the author mean? What specifically I should update on my Android phone and Laptop?
Apple are patching it in a FEW WEEKS.... R.I.P. Wifi
You've discovered the NSA's backdoor.
Glad this is on trending.
I don't know wtf is going on but this is trending so I like it
What's this about ? Can someone explain ?
Time to have fun!!
where can i get my hands on the krack tool ?
Where are those people who been telling that linux is the most secure system in the world? lol
Where can I get these files
so that means hacker could check all my porn data files????
This is extremely serious and everyone should be made aware of this major vulnerability in the WPA2 protocol affecting all WiFi devices I know of.
nigga am i fucked right now please answer is everyone fucked?
Excellent work, Mathy. And pretty nice video explaining how it is done (usually i dont really get it what is happening, but here i could almost completely follow and understand the steps) and what can be hijacked by exploiting the issue -> workaround: do not use unencrypted end-to-end protocols in the meanwhile until WPA(2) is fully fixed :) . Nice research, hope you´ll get your deserved donations after finding such a trivial implementation issue on a (for a long time) stated secure protocol and help on getting a safer internet for the world. I cannot believe that no one had yet discovered that issue - at least no one made it public....
please give me the exploit
anyone else really confused what's going on here and only clicked on this video because it was on trending??
is the .py script open source?
Why is YouTube promoting this? WTF DOES THIS MEAN GOOGLE? Fuck this. I'm moving to IOS. Cunts.
Can anyone say me were the Python Script Is Available ?? plzz
Consequences will hit us soon and powerfully.
Does this only work with android due to csa injection or can this be used on other devices?
Cant trust nothing now days. I dont think ill ever buy a smartphone again in the future
I'm wrong or is the same attack than Fluxon since 2016?
(war is not solution)
would a vpn connection temporarily fix this issue until an update is release to fix this?
So basically,  if I see the green https on majority of websites then Im cool?
This nonce reuse attack is very interesting but why you mixed up the SSLStrip trick on top of it?
can you please share the script we have to test
Great, video, thank you so much
So..... how do I protect?
Can i run this game with 4 gb of ram??

Good for him. I hope his story puts a little seed of doubt in the minds of other neo-nazis.
They do say the all bullies are secretly hurting inside...
Holy shit
lol calls himself a nazi, has a bust of hitler, then spouts out 6 million jews died in the holocaust.. Dumbest nazi ever or a troll. probably both to believe that bullshit
What a brave man 👏🏻the interview was brilliant. The journalist really allowed the truth to manifest itself & he didn’t enforce his own emotion or judgment which I assume is not an easy task with this offensive topic
It's called controlled opposition. This man is a subverter of the highest regard.
Has anyone here ever read the book 1984? Do you remember who the leader of the so-called opposition and rebellious party was?? That's right - (((Emmanuel Goldstein))). I wonder which one of these psych-OP Federal Agents is the biggest liar and Jew? Lol
state of the comments by the jew haters on here. Conspiracy idiots who spend their lives online. Fucking losers
So Social Justice is part of the Nazi manifesto. Who would've guessed?
Well, I’m gay, and live in Norway, i met one of the leaders of the nazi movement(its very small, not even 50 people, bigger in Sweden,but that’s no surprise really,they where never invaded by the nazis and wanted to be neutral) here for 2 years ago on a gay dating app(he told me lies about his name, and where he lived). I met him 4-5  times, I really liked him, we talked, had sex, he was just very in the closet, and i had to promise to never talk about it, that is not uncommon on gay dating apps anyway, many married men there and people way in the closet. I had no idea who he was, before i saw him being interviewed on tv about the group he is in..that was a shock to say is mildly....people, if you hate someone or something that much, it’s because you reflect or try to get away from a part of you that you don’t like, it’s common psychology really.....
Oh no, one person changed his political views because he never believed in them in the first place. How will the far right ever recover?
It would be great to have a documentary about former NF/neo-nazi members in their older age. To interview them and their families and what their offspring have gone off to achieve.
Lol this jew propaganda is pathetic. This guy was never a national socialist, anyone that read the article sees he was a homo and a jew. This is a subversive and used by the (((media))) to continue to disarm white people.
OK, I hope he has really changed for the better...
It's almost like NA is controlled opposition used to mislead nationalists.
Today's Nazis have been supporting Zionist terror regime they just against Muslims and Hindus
Wut. I bet that wasn't expected.
Shamed to say I know this duplicitous cunt, if you're gay fair enough, but to hide behind a smokescreen and pertain to be against it like he did... UTTER TWAT!
I'm sure they want to thank you for your service have built a special oven for the occasion.
Now that's a headline 😭
To paraphrase William Shakespear Those who protest too much
Wow. If it is true that he can swing from that paridigm to the next paridigm it would be fascinating to see what psychologists would discover about his personality.  It has to be one where he is not deeply effected by the need for approval from others or  at the least he with stands critism easily.   And I am not making any analysis good bad or indifferent of such personages.  But would you conclude as well this sort of person is not stimulated by a great need of social approval at the very least?  He does say he is worried about being alone and he did say he wanted to be part of the group.  So I might be wrong as I am not a psychologist. What do you summarize?
Nazism is stupid. End of Story.
What is with the comments on here? I can't be sure if its just pathetic trolling nazis or genuine scum. Good on the guy for coming to his senses, after years of nazi-cult brainwashing.. as for the comments about Antifa.. they don't incite hatred like you nationalist chumps do, a real patriot stands proud against the ugliness of fascism we fought two wars over, the only good nazi is a dead one.
Every white supremacist I've ever met was an utter failure in life.  Every   single   one.
Awwwww boo hoo I bet he must feel so guilty and sorry for himself, bless him.\n\nShould have locked him up and thrown away the key Or better yet, give him to a group of immigrants and let them 'sort' him out.
Absolute gold. Its like all those anti gay preachers getting caught with rent boys. Beware those who protest too much
Ayy thats one more Jew added to our 15mil population
This is too fuckin funny.
Native Brits will be a hated minority in their own homeland within the next 30 years. Anyone who doesn't want this is a Nazi.
isnt channel 4 owned by a jew? (david abrahams)  isnt hope not hate a jew funded and staffed ngo? what are the odds on this guy being a spy? i find this story very hard to believe. remember folks, the media is in hostile hands and we are ruled by liars and war mongers, the controlled media is part of that globalist machine
ATTENTION ANYONE STUPID WNOUGH TO BELIEVE THIS GOVERNMENT AGENT - You should check out the real thing, and biggest Evil Neo-Nazi online. Search Milleneal Woes on YouTube. He is literally Hitler reincarnate, and is responsible for killing 60 Jews singlehandedly over the last decade!
THE BLOKE DID THE RIGHT THING THE NAZI THING WAS THAT HITLER LOST THE 2ND WORLD WAR
Many of the same guys today are frustrated latent homosexuals dying to come.
what a cuck
It doesn't seem to be the neo nazis that are the biggest threat to EU Jews, it seems to be another steadily growing demographic...but we all know the BBC will continue to deny that.
NAZI's under the bed. Everyone who isnt a Corbyn/May open borders cultural marxist must be a Nazi. Anyone who doesnt agree with the Kalergi Plan is a Nazi. Harold Wilsons Labour Party operated normal border controls. So he must have been a Nazi too.
Wow right on man✌️

Holy shit....it's Milo's father !!!!!!!!
SHOCKER
The so called left of today need to be reminded what a real Nazi looks like.
Lets not mention left wing groups such as antifa sending death threats and stabbing people though.... left wing propaganda is a joke.
Lol nobody self-identifies as a neo Nazi, except feds and government agents. Good propaganda though. Goebells would be proud! I mean a Jewish neo Nazi?? Haha, top troll! This guy is a blatant Fed and part of MI6, that is simply being used to caricature and demonise, very legitimate views about White Nationalism, which have existed in England, Germany and America for centuries.\n\nThere is no way this guy would be able to answer any questions regarding white nationalism correctly, because he has never been a Nationalist. \n\nFor example, I've never heard of someone discovering all the lies about the Holocaust, and then randomly start believing in the 6 Gorrilian again lol
Sodomite Jesuit Mason claims to be Jewish while in sighting divisions and lawlessness now promoting hateful Sodomy against the will of The creator and God which is why he gets mainstream news attention.
Bollocks.
Gurl BYE.
Shill
All NAZIs are gay.
Can't wait for the video about the modern day fascists known as Antifa. Oh wait, this is Channel 4.
exactly, you can never trust a jew, my friend.
Scumbag of the highest order
*'JEWISH' IS NOT A NATIONALITY...NOR IS IT A RACE!!!*\n\nIf it's a nationality, where is 'Jewland'... If it's a race, why are there Jewish people from all ethic backgrounds?
i admire this man. It takes real balls to walk away from these coward nazis.
It's amazing to see all the neo-nazis swarm to this video. Got those keywords on lockdown? With such poorly thought-out beliefs, and an inability to defend them on rational grounds, it's hilariously desperate. In the ring of ideas, they are simply infantile. It's nice to see that the guy in this video succeeded at the mentioned goal. I hope he studies some psychology and writes a book!
Rot in hell, you gay Jew nazi!
Mild compared to some other groups...
Oh so now we have a Jewish who use to heat himself 😳
Get that body count down.\nhttps://youtu.be/6qKMddxrXwc
I once had group sex with the national front with just all men and im asian...loved it not more then them though
You'd think Neo-Nazis would embrace gays. Hitler's crew had more than a few.
Most Nazis are closeted homosexuals and most likely suck some dicks on the sly. lol.. It all makes sense when you look at their narcissistic ideology which focuses on race and appearances and all that other nonsense. Must have sucked to have been this guy though living a life full of hatred. Good for him for realising where he was wrong.
G'day,\n\n  Surprise, surprise...?\n\n   Why is anybody surprised that a longterm loudmouthed Poofterbasher finally comes out and admits that he's always actually been a Closet Poofter, all along...?\n\n   Why is anybody surprised that a Jew-Baiting Neo-Nazi is the son of a Jewess...; it worked for Joseph Goebbels ?\n\n This is fairly simple, Pop-psychobabblologically speaking ; the bloke has Bin-Overcompensatin', clearly...\n\n  ;-p\n\n  Ciao !
He want to hide his weakness through putting mask on his face as Nazi
a jewish nazi fag, saying 6 million jews died in the holocaust, on jew owned channel 4.. oy vey
Who needs the Faggot Jew Lover. He just became doubly useless to Society. FUCK ANTIFA, what a joke THEY ARE!
The best way to control the 'opposition' is to lead it ourselves.  - Vladimir Ulyanov Lenin\n\nI imagine most of these White Nationalist so-called leaders all have similar secrets...Jewish, homosexual, or even part Black.  And not something they discovered later...but knew all along, and sought out such roles to make sure real opposition to the New World Order can never actually rise.
40 years of surpressing your sexuality during the prime of your life should make any one angry and violent.\nunfortunately instead of lashing out at those he was afraid to expose his sexuality too, he suffered misplaced aggression and targered an even more vulnerable group to exploit.\nmisplaced aggression is typical of all conservatives.\nall paramilitary,  malitia members, are closet homosexuals.
so he figured out he's a twat...and the news is?
Guilt and aggression of both sides are true
This is pretty brave
Best actor ever.
Eat your pistol kike faggot. Gtfo of Europe.
ZIONIST JEWS ARE EVIL
sellout jeeeew faggot!  figures only a jeeeew
This is fascinating - what a great report.
Ironic thing is, if the National Front gained any real power back then in the 70s, we would be having none of the problems we are facing today. No terrorist attacks, no sharia courts, no 3,000 ISIS jihadists or 23,000+ radical islamists in the UK, no mass immigration, white brits wouldnt be a minority in London, it would still be a british city, NHS wouldnt be collapsing, no political correctness nonsense and diversity quotas discriminating normal britis.. This country would have been better off, unfortunately they didnt stop this before it was too late, and these issues are only going to get much worse every year..
This is an old story that happens all the time. They even made a movie about this happening called The Believer. Jews join organizations where they would not be welcome intending to fuck everything up.
A whole bunch of stupid in this video.
A Jew and a gay cuck? Hell awaits his type.
We, the world have a greater problem than ever before thought, we the world have a greater curse upon us than previously imagined. The Jew, this personage, lost in the darkness and Satan's tool in the light, has doomed us all idle subjects to time's lies..
pathetic
Well.... someone feels like egg
Hate does not solve anything but fighting hate with hate creates more hate.
hahaha the alt right twats are gonna be in bits watching this
The more comments I see against Antifa, the more I support them.  The only people who have problems with them are nazi sympathizers.   Nazis are scum.  How this is controversial now, is unbelievable.
I bet he regrets doing this, His life was NS.
I feel sad, I feel sad that I belong to a race that knows nothing but hate. I wish I could take a space ship and fly to a planet where I would never see humans again. I would even wish to have a different body shape, just so that I can't be remembered of the filth this planet.
Most Brits are jews and homos. Can't ever trust em.
I do not have space for discussion in this subject
Great performance from Alexandra. I wish she’d return to music . I miss her amazing voice and music.
It's impossible for me to watch this and not have the biggest smile on my face ❤️✨
She should do porn instead.
She can sing, she can dance, she's pretty, and she's unproblematic. Absolute travesty that she's not selling out stadiums all over the world
“All my ladies you can do it. You can do it even better in broken heels” LOVE ALEXANDRA!!!!
No offence to Alexandra- she’s amazing, but I can’t help staring at Gorka. That man is beautiful....
I think you will find that is proud Mary by Creedence Clearwater Revival.
Woah! What A Dance! Enthusiasm Truly Seen! For Dancing A Song From The 2015 Group Dance Finale, And SHOCKING ME In The Start, I Give A Big Fat 100!
still living for this!!!!!!
*retrieves jaw from the ground*
MY GIRL ON TRENDING
Amazing !
This is a great performance from Alexandra.
Best dance so far by a mile, no slips. She's joined the group of great jives up with Scott, Jill, Austin, Jay and Ore. 10.
THEY LOOK FAB! I'll be so upset if they don't win they are clearly the best
My winner by far 😆😆💛💛💛
B O N E L E S S T R E N D I N G
My jaw dropped when I saw this on TV !!! SHES SO GOD DAM GOOD
U
As a huge Tina Turner fan, she definitely did her proud!! Amazing!!
I'm not an Alexandra fan at all, but OMG can that girl dance. That was sensational, and the body on her. Absolutely fantastic
hi
#1 on trend!
I love Strictly
gooD
Ohhhh dear me
video verry good luck

She was great.
OMG
Good afternoon

Trending number one!! Slay
She is a star 🌟 she is bringing soul back to life! Love her! ♥️🤗 I hope she wins! 👍😎
1 on trending congratulations guys!!!
Just WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I want her to win but strictly and dailymail have already decided to be Gemma. You can tell  by the way DM are trying to assassinate alexandra character and putting stories about her and gemma feuding over some guy.
what is dis
Thanks to the band and singers for keeping it tight...
Hey guys, I've been making YouTube videos for a while now and I'm really trying to reach 200 subs, I would really appreciate it if you subbed ❤️
Cutest elephant ever!
Who remembers the days when X Factor was better than Strictly ...
Definitely Alexandra is my favourite - she dances like a professional
1like = your person of choice will win\nSubscribe=you’ll be on strictly
I takes a lot for me to take my eyes off Gorka and she certainly did! Absolutely phenomenal dance, especially this early in the competition!
PRO ENTERTAINER BEING GOOD AT SOMETHING WELL WE NEVER SAW THAT COMING DID WE
That was awesome.  \nI might start watching this show now.
Her husband disliked the video 127 times
She’s an amazing dancer. But to pretend this is a 10 is misleading. She clearly has sickle feet. Aston (as much as I’m not a fan of his dancing, forcing as much hip hop moves in to the dance as possible), got railroaded for having pigeon toes. Not fair this was given a ten. But her energy was awesome and she is clearly the strongest dancer. Still a winner.
OMG I remember watching Alexandra win the X factor years ago when I was a kid! It's great to see her more!
ALEX BURKE!! YESS!!
Dont watch this video .... \nI repeat its a trap. Dont watch this video\nhttps://youtu.be/W7GY8HPG-pc
Alexandra's mother would be so so proud of her...she looks amazing up there....
Hope she wins the show!
reminds e of Alesha and also Nathalie gummede    and all the fuss because shes ccouldnt t do her jive  to this song and she was the favourite at the time
I don’t know why this got tens. She was so technique wise shit.
Go girl, you are killing it 💖💟
Addictive, can't stop watching it, that was superb. 👏🏽scd I agree routine was hot.
best evil dance ever seen... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo22Al8H7GU

Song is by creedence clearwater revival...tina only covered it
John Fogerty was such a great songwriter.
Her legs were hypnotic! I honestly thought one of her shoes would fly off she was that slick and speedy!
That was amazing!! Perfect timing, excellent routine, choice of song brilliant - couldn't have been better!
Alexandra deserves to win this series! That's only if people stop voting for Ken & Barby!
My Grandma is obssessed with strictly come dancing

Check out my page 20 years in maximum security prison
Definitely a great performance from Alex and partner but I hope Craig was on his feet in disgust about them not sticking to the '10 second rule'!!!
I black who can Dance so what? \nWould anyone be surprised if a white invented flights to the sun?
Her singing career didn't work out so she's doing this ahahah #fail
One question, why did the BBC cut Alexandra hair in the thumbnail?🤔🤔🤔
Brilliant energy, but the slide between Gorkas legs wasn't as smooth as it could have been and where were kicks and flicks ?  Also why no comment on pincy toes that seems a big deal with certain celebs?  Great dance but not a 10
Oh dear oh dear, choreographed by Craig Revile Horwood in Sister Act and you say she's not a professional?? Shame that the comments have been removed from here regarding this.
why does she have different hair in the thumbnail?
This was an ok performance but not worth the 10s given. Picking a winner at week four is both biased and a little premature.
shes a trained dancer though!!! it'd be like David Beckham playing in a celebrity football match¬!!!\n\nthe fake tears every week dont help either!
taemin is so all-around talented, i don't understand why he's not the biggest thing in asia
Please please please 🙏🏼 let him perform this at Mama! This song is a bop and the dance, seriously it’s like watching an art work
I don't get why some people say the song is not good, when it is exceptional. This is so underrated istg. Taemin did a good job in picking the songs in this album and in performing the choreo, he's a living art. Love lots~
i know he try to be sexy as man but why i still sees him as a cute taemin over his face😂
I was kinda hoping something to explode but only my ovaries did😐
Its too much to handle.  His voice is sexy , but it can be better lol
Can't stop watching this.. Taemin is amazing artist! ✨
Jyst realized that move that he did while dressed in d nipple n chest bearing shirts is d opening move of his solo dance spot in Replay...dats why it look so familiar to me!!😍
Take a small bite\nOh honey you a whole buffet not a snack
Taemin is so hot and cool
This is so effin sexy!!!  Love the song and the choreography!
Yasssssss 🙌 Taemin and OMG that hairstyle ❤️ on you!!! Is so HOTTTTT 😻😻
My soul left my body the moment he started singing lol 💖😘😭😱
finally, Taemin coming out of the closet! check the video at 3:04, two guys making out
Fuck yes! Koharu Sugawara! I'm so happy he's dancing with her again!! They make such a good duo!
Come on shawol! 1 million threshold is not the end!! Keep streaming!
I CAN'T HANDLE
type of song that will be play at H&M
daebak even a weird ass choreography can become soO sleek when taemin does his thing\n\nit's only weird if i danced to it tho
Why do I always feel like Taemin is trying to seduce me...?? 😂 *dead*
He is so beautiful, also his dancing, his soft voice and lighting made him more beautiful and sexy
taemin has OUTDONE himself this is so perfect and sensual and asfsgsbsj
Koharu Sugawara and Taemin collabs? Can't handle it! Koharu is one of my favourite choreographer <3 She's beyond perfect honestly when it comes to dancing and getting on that beats and melody. Taemin sexiness is unreal the world isn't ready for this!!
Where Have I been all this time\nI’ve been sleeping on you King I’m so sorry omfg
Taemin you go, so angry I didn’t listen to it earlier ❤️
Stream stream stream lets go for 2m stream on melon, every site which will help taemin in music sites to win.
Has anybody noticed that it's koharu in the video!!! The legend koharu!!
Sexy in his own way..
Okay. Everything about this comeback is so... MJ-esque AND I LOVE IT. From the BG music down to the choreo (especially when they flick their arms, the head bop, the hip swings) it's like a unique rendition of what MJ means to Taemin!
Take a Small Bite 😏
its still trending in nepal if you want to know whether the video is on trending then on the location on your mobile
I'm so gay
It's like he's the snake dancing and I'm prey I can't look away till its finished I'd be dead if he was I'm hypnotized
He's so sexy and chic 🙃❤️
its slow and deep seduction from beginning to end whew
We love an electronica king
ㅁㅊㄷ 너무 섹시해ㅐㅐㅐㅐㅐㅐ 하....ㅠㅠ 나 어떻게 진짜 큰일났다 후ㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏ

망해라 태민
Thank you for saving kpop for me taemin :_)
Taemin looks similar to Gackt-sama.
love this ❤❤❤
TAEMIN means Talent Art Experience Meaningful Innovation Natural
피어싱 다 뺐네
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.,. taemin-aa.,#screaming
omg 😍😍
Ayyy Taemin oppar
Omg is fantastic
No.14 on trending in England! Wooo 👏
YESSSSSSS!
He is amazing! 💕💕💕🤤🤤🤤🤤
Темин так держать!✊🏻 клип просто 💣 танец класс! Мне все нравиться💖 Горячий привет Всем из KZ🇰🇿
태민정말매력적인데조회수는은근적은듯. .
노래정말좋다~ 자꾸듣게되네 ~
Cada vez Tae se ve tan sofisticado. Le mando toda la buena vibra para este álbum. Orgullosa de la evolución de nuestro maknae. Orgullosa de ser Shawol
Trending #16 in the UK 😱😱❤️❤️ IM SO PROUD OF YOU TAEMIN!! THIS IS SUCH AN OUTSTANDING COMEBACK!!
Ok i have never been a SHINee or Taemin stan but holy this video is incredible. his dancing and appearance is like a genderless river of sensuality that flows so effortlessly. His movements are a language of their own. and 1:32... he looks unreal! This incredible androgynous art deserves a lot more attention. Way to go Taemin!
when taemin's hair is styled up, im dead.
Okay Taemin just owns the sensual concept esp with his voice it just works
cant get this out of my head
I can't handle this😲😚😚😍😍😍
Who's dead?\nT..me af cause I can't with this MANNNN (he hasn't been a boy in awhile)
finally something original and magnetic :) other new k.pop songs feel so the same but this here is another thing wow :)
I like how him and the dancers don't even have to sensually touch each other to create chemistry. It's just born on it's own though their dance moves, it's hard to explain how they do it but Taemin is really the definition of an artist. He brings his own essence to everything he does. And never disappoints.
I promised Jonghyun that I'm gonna be loyal to him. Well... I'm not really good at keeping promises.
THIS SONG IS POPPING 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 I love the part 0:00 - 3:54 like slay king taemin 💕
The sexiest song of the century
i can’t stop watching this
Taeminnie 😍😍 slowly killing me with that look 😏🤤💀 in love with the song 💗
😱!!!\nLove it 😍 \nThat's all ❤
I fucking love this so much..just as I was beginning to give up on kpop...Taemin saves the day.
this is literally hypnotizing holy shit
Sounds really cool when played at 1.25x speed
dont get me wrong i am not comparing or whatsoever but he has the micheal jackson vibe man so amazing
When the female dancers are better than his usual male back up dancers lol!! Slay!!
The performances will  be amazing
Koharu!!! I love it when she and Taemin dance together!
I seriously can't stop listening to this song
There's no way he will top the last solo ... TAEMIN DOES EXACTLY THAT and I loved me some Flame Of Love ❤️
Song is sexy, video is amazing and duo is perfect! <3
แทมินน  เพลงนี้เพราะมากก ติดหูมากด้วย  ที่สำคัญแทมินหล่อมาก555

Opppaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Essa chuva ai deixou o clima do mv bem sexy
Please tell me Ian Eastwood Choreographed this.
When does the full album come out? I need to be ready at 1 o clock in the morning when it comes out
Later she complained because some guy raped her with his eyes.
There going to hook up after the fight
she Loved it, all giggley and shit.
loved her reaction. why can't we americans be this light hearted.
Looks like two trans people kissing. Nothing to see here, keep it moving
Que merda
She a freak.
Yeah but if a man does it, it's rape. Women want equal rights so she should get charged with sexual assault just like a man would. Women want equal rights, right?
I'm going to be watching this p*rn... I mean Fight for sure!
SAPATAO
O Que É Isso !?
Cecilia is the best female boxer in the world.\nShe's got 5 belts and never been defeated.\nShe makes me proud to be Norwegian!
Its a good thing it wasn't a guy who kissed her or we'd have every triggered feminist in the world blowing up the comments.
Mikaela does this to promote   the fight! She got just the respons she was looking for. More interest in the fight more money that's all this is and secondly a mindgame with the opponent.
They’ll make more money if they get a room, stream the video of them getting it on and sell tickets at £10 a piece ON THE INTERWEBZ. LOL
Probably going to get their massive fat clits out later and hit each other with them.
Should've smashed her face in, foreign trash.
Female privilege at its finest. This is some grabem by the pussy shit right here, and everyone just laughs... But Cam Newton can't even joke with a bitch without losing an endorsement
Ok, that was hot, I don't care what anyone says. The blonds was able to get her lips right in there, before the other one reacted. At the very least it doesn't say much for her reflexes.
I'm hard as fuck now.... gotta find out where to download it now....
Shouldn't she be in real trouble for doing  this.  If I was to just walk up to a person and plant my lips on them I'd be done for sexual harrasment.
They both enjoyed it
I haven't got that in a while 😂😂😂 love her reaction
Thumbs up if you would have done the same ting lol that bitch is hot 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾she loved that shit that's why she was giggling 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
the dominant alpha struts off not a are in the world
Looks like the girl on the left is actually straight
Stayed in the shame, lol
Not in front of the camera's.
*surprisingly I got a stiff one in my pants after watching this*
Que sexy! Mas pêra aê, isso não é assédio? Ah se fosse um homem roubando selinho de uma mulher...
Ja vi q não vai ter lutinha. O amor está no ar
Caiu gaita é porq gostou...safadinha kkkkk
she was probably thinking I'd hit it
Love has no borders....
I first posted when there was less than 200 views.
She just got broken. Fights over
*Fake laugh it off \n\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Ahhh HAHAHAHAHA.
That so fucking digusting
Her reaction is priceless.
She liked it
lesbian. liked it.
Sexual harassment
Hah, gay!!
was this consentual???
She laughs it off?
She laughed the rape off
Black girl was dripping wet yet guilty
Made her blink though!
nossa kkk
????
Ta ,alguém me explica
That escalated quickly
A de vervelho gostou😍
#hertoo
Le gustó, le gustó... 😁
Now kiss.  omg it worked
They both look weird af
She got wet
isto é a maior putaria
Parece traveco queria bjo não tbm
Don't fight it. I know you want to kiss back.
Se lo tomó como lo que era... una genial broma... Excelente actitud...
Já podem atuar na Globo
That was friggin hilarious
sexyhttps://youtu.be/u2vtiLtuiSA
HAWT!
I loved their reaction!!
Fucking male trash
Cecilia will smash that swedish twat to pieces.
I knew female boxers were dykes
Que gei.
Awesome!
😂
forced ??? Cecilla wanted it too...
The black haired lady is now confused and waiting for her opponent's phone call for a night f******** session.
I am sorry but I don't find homosexuality humorous. I find it disgusting. I really do.
*Now if a guy did that. He would be shot*
Sexual abuse ?
Female boxer kisses opponent thanks for clearing that up for me
Swedes really are fucked. Homo, no-kid having queers replacing themselves with sandniggers.
q legal essas coisas q o YouTube ta BOTando no em alta
Prolonga mais esse beijo, quero me excitar

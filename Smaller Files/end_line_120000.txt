Klopp is very frustrating! I am starting to hate him because he is making my Liverpool FC a dumbass club.
Hazard turn him into a Beyblade HAHAHA
Chelsea please beat arsenal today
Hazard turned Coquelin into a fidget spinner!
R.I.P 4rsenal
Chelsea win 6-0
Morata vs Lacazette \nZappacosta vs Kola\nBakayoko vs Xhaka \nHolding vs Cristensen\n\nGame on. Lets see who have the better signing and prospect for the future. COME ON YOU BLUES!!!!!!!\nLets shut the gooners up.
I am a chelsea fan and today is birthday,can i get a like?
Hazard The Mercenary hope one day he turns overrated Ramos inside-out
Morata's headers are lit.
Hazard and Morata are 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Savage Dan🙌🙌
I'm surprised Hazard still isn't serving a life sentence after what he did Coquelan
Chelsea cmon you blues! Like for Chelsea to win!
Hazard is a god. 4-0 Chelsea win!!
Lets destroy Arsenal, 3-1 for Chelsea
Jheeeeeze! Man like Dan! 🔥🔥🔥
He turned coq to be fidget spinner
200th like here
Chelsea win !!!
Let's smash ARSEnal
Hope he does the same today.. Come on you blues 💙💙💪
Such a shame that Coquelin is injured! 😂😂😂
3-0 by Chelsea ...Morata,Alonso,Willian
Chelsea to win 3-1
Beyblade lol
First
Sav Dan is killing it
he needs at least 15 similar goals in a single season to win the ballon dor
really sad when hazard didn't play last night, i know maybe conte wont take the risk but i think it's important to win that match, and i think even the unfit hazard still better than any other player.
David Luiz had to attack more because everyone else wasn’t doing enough and got pinned into a red card. I really hope Conte changes the squad the next few games because we are in need of some variety. Can’t expect to win against an in form Man City when we can’t even score against Arsenal at home....
Is this savage dan from 3 shots of Tequila???
i was the 1600 guy to hit like
Lol 0-0 and a Red card a win for Arsenal. Deluded club
disgrace of a performance today.
this is on trending
But hazards not even starting, I'm almost worried now
I remember that goal i had one aim to score against Arsenal and i make sure it was a greatest goal that can be talked about in years and i'm super delighted to score such a beautiful goal.
I remember him being a ghost in the fa cup final as well.
Is it okay if I don't like the new third kit?
Never knew Wolfy was a Chelsea fan, always pops up on miniminter's channel too
Chelsea vs Arsenal today come on Chelsea!!!!!!
Guys, Please who can give the name of the music in the background?
Please don't lose and give those fans something to cheer about. We are much better now go and prove it
I predict Morata and Alonso to score
He had to wake up at 8 am to watch the match? I have to wake up at 4:45 am to watch
Morals has more to his game than Lacazette, he can score with both feet, his head and he can dribble.
If you're reading this....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave a great day
Martial is a better player than hazard.
Willian and Pedro are USELESS\n4 games without Cahil, 4 wins\n2 games with Cahill, 1 draw, one loss, reduced to 10 men on both occasions\nOur best possible line up. \nGk: courtois... good keeper, but needs to get the sloppy mistakes out of his system\nCb: Azpilequeta, good defender, no flaws\nLuiz: just keep his head in the game, played well today\nRudiger, good defender, solid\nWb: Moses, very good defensively\nAlonso, deadly going forward\nCm: bakayoko, so good, the physical man\nKante, obviously \nFabregas, must learn to track back a little more\nSt: Morata, great finisher, needs a little more time to learn how to play an epl defender\nHazard, he needs to step up, 20 goals a season at least and 10 assists, a player of his talent is expected to score that many \nChristensen, zapacosta can fill when needed, and drink water will be could when we need to be more defensive in place of fabregas
Lets destroy arsenal today hazard may man👍
We've won 9 out of the last 10 vs Arsenal at the bridge. 3-1 today. KTBFFH
Sav like Dan
haha
Cahill the shittiest chelsea captain
Rip 0-0
Man Like Dan

Hi
First half we are so quiet, COME ON YOU BLUES second half show time
1 like = 1 goal against arsenal
1 like = 1 prayer for arsenal
I'm not even gonna get all hyped up, I remain humble. 2-1 Chelsea considering our CL match on Tuesday.
Imagine Arsenal wins or draws...
So your Grandmother put a tv in the basement closet for you?
People think way to much in to things it's a dam show
Excuse me? Can you please leave?
This is a hypothesis, not theory
So he's the rightful heir to the iron throne
Huh. And here all this time I thought Joey was the mom's brother.
You know I actually thought of this a few years back but I was like nah joey wouldn't do that to Danny
so you think joey banged danny’s dead wife 3 separate times with several years in between each & each time resulted with her getting pregnant? ok.
Or maybe all the kids were blond due to the fact that blondes are more appealing for television. Or also, who the fuck cares?!
It's just Joey.  Not Uncle Joey.
Wasn't Danny s wife joeys sister?
that was worth me not unsubscribing from you guys months ago.
plenty of brunette adults are blonde as children, in fact blondism is a decidedly juvenile genetic trait. ugh!
My dad had dark hair -- my mom light brown which darkened as she got old.\n\nAll four of us kids ended up with hair at various shades of brown -- no dark haired kids amongst us.\n\nYour theory is invalid. \n\nStop ruining people's childhoods.
Both my and my half-brother's dads are brunettes. We were both born with our mother's sandy blonde hair, while she herself comes from a brunette father and very light (practically white) blond- haired mother. Though to be fair mine has darkened as I've gotten older and now it's a shade where you could call it either dark blonde or light brown and it would be valid lol
My dad's hair is black and my brother and I have blonde hair so your move...
Genetics aren't that simple.   Depending on the parents of the dark haired parent, if one is blonde for example, the gene for blonde hair can be stronger.   Additionally, all 3 children are girls.   Remember that the man provides 1 X chromosome and 1 Y, whereas the woman provides 2 X, and the girls end up with 2 X's.   This means more of the woman's genes will be carried over.
I think it says more about TV executives favouring blonde children over children with other hair colours. The same is with Everybody Loves Raymond. Ray and his wife Deborah both have brown hair but all three of their kids have blonde hair. But unlike Full House, there's no uncle or friend that has blonde hair to suggest any infidelity going on.
to me, the truly _insane_ part of this, is you're paying your _rent_ doing this shit. get a _real_ job hippie. #sarcasm
Is that the horse from horsin' around?
This is stupid as shit, making up fan stories on a fictitious show.
*MORON.. hey moron! Does it not occur to you Danny's WIFE was a blonde?!*
HOW LONG IS THIS SHIT VIDEO GONNA BE TRENDING?
so Joey doesn't want a relationship causes he's sleeping with all his best friends wife's, makes since, Joey's got secret game!
Unless both Joey and the dead wife have homozygous recessive alleles for blonde hair, there is still just as much of a chance that the theory is false.
Women love the funny guys
Jessies kids are probably blonde bc his wife could have been blonde but died her hair.
ha ha ha.... it's like you think they really exist and are the wet dream children of casting directors who prefer blonde kids.
such an idiotic theory with no evidence other than him being blonde. i watched this expecting him to go in depth with it, when he said that he was blonde i thought thats stupid. maybe this is just the surface level evidence but nope. that was the entire thing. next time, do more research, gather more evidence or don't make the video.
Or maybe Joey is actually the mom after transgender modification....🤔
I love how they finally gave clippy a show
IT'S A SHOW. CHILL OUT. DON'T RUIN THE SHOW BY GETTING SO PRECISE AND WITH DETAIL. THEY JUST HIRED RANDOM ACTORS AND PUT ON A GR8 SHOW 😂😂😂
just dont bring the twins back
Both my parents have brown hair and brown eyes. All 3 of my older sisters have dirty blonde hair with green eyes. \nI just destroyed this entire theory.
what if Danny and Jesse are sterile and joey only donated sperm? wouldn't that just strengthen their bond? i wonder if this even gets read...i never get feedback ...i never know if i'm on the ball or nuts.
This still makes more sense than the olsen twins disappearing altogether.
Please stop recycling the same crap from your articles that we've already read and bring back pop culture discussion
Passing over Saget for Coulier? Sure. Passing over Stamos for Coulier? No way. It's freaking Stamos. There is nothing about Coulier to suggest he is capable of that level of sexual prowess compared to Stamos and you oughta know better. Wait. You oughta know? YOU OUGHTA KNOW! OK, the theory in this video is 100 percent accurate.
The mom has blonde hair... and yes, both parents having blonde hair increases the chances of having blonde children, it also doesn't guarantee it.
https://youtu.be/rnJ4blc_S6g                   best I ever saw
Here me out... here me out, those kids are blonde and like... Joey is blonde. Coincidence?
Ironically enough, they give Joey 4 kids and a wife in Fuller House... Interesting
Obviously this guy doesn't know how genetics work.
Or they just happen to have hired blonde actors?
Why did i read this as insane crack house theory
i put on my headphones for this?!
The probability would be 50% for each child. They are independent on one another. Just because one was born with blonde hair does not mean the other has a lesser chance of being blonde
How about the blonde kids on Everybody loves Raymond?
Really? He's blonde and so is their Mom, therefore they're probably his kids. Logic
Or it's a show and they can't cast people properly
Ok the chances of all being blond, which is 12.5% isn't even that slim. You know that it's possible that all of them can be blond. I have a cousin that is blond but her mom and dad have brown hair.
This is just a show the little kids are just actors .  they don't actually find kids that have brown hair just to look like
It's a fucking show I can't believe someone would read that much into it
Marketing and advertising Offer: Free of charge Apple iPhone. Get a new apple iphone every year. To register and get a Free of cost iphone go to google and type: *givefonesaway*
it's a sitcom, i doubt they put that much thought into it. all these weird ass theories are reaching.
Lmao I want this to be true so bad
What a load of crap, it's only a tv show
My mom has dark brown hair and my dad has black hair and all through my childhood I was bleach blonde and then my hair eventually darkened to a dark brown
You do realize that it's not 50% chance, thats not  how genes work bruh this is basic shit a middle schooler knows better
Dude... Its a hair color mine doesn't match either one of my parents nor does my siblings. Its a show nobody really slept with anyone sounds like youre paranoid
*THESE COMMENTS ARE KILLING ME!😂*
The people watching this who don't know what Full House is, don't give  two shits. The people, like me, who used to watch this show is thinking that this video is retarded as fuck.
Makes sense to me...
Here the thing it's a show.
Will someone Please send me 1 dollar to my paypal I really need it. Thank you! ashleeowl2011@gmail.com
That's some games of thrones shit hahaha i lost my mind
It's so obvious that Joey fucked both of their wives,😂
What the fuck? I'll believe those aren't Danny's kids, but Jesse's?!? No way man.
Ok, I have finally gotten the message....     I NEED TO GET A LIFE !!!!!!!!  🚲🚢🚙⚓⛵🎵🏈🎯⚽🎉🎉
My dad has jet black hair and my mom has blonde hair...and I have blonde hair
Why is this in my recommended?
Lol
LOL!
Stop it.
Fucking lie
rofl, get it joey
12.5% isn't that unlikely.
joey oughta know
Gladstones I bet!!! Am I right fellas?!
next series cramped house
Satire or weak argument?
This is fake
This is not very well thought out... First of all obviously Joey ISNT the father of the actors. Yes it is strange that all of the children had blonde hair but at the same time they were children when they were casted, and hair can change when they age, for instance i was born with red hair but it changed to blonde then auburn and then a dark more brown auburn, my mom has auburn hair that was more red and my dad has black brown hair, which made it darker then my moms but with red undertones still.\n\n DJ was more of a dirty blonde which could be due to their mothers AND the fact that Dannys mom was i believe is a blonde as well, which makes his brown a bit less dominant. Dannys children being blonde is not illogical because his hair may have been more blonde during early childhood. As far as Uncle Jesse's children, the mother was blonde, and Jesse's sister was blonde, which means he carries the genetic trait. I dont know about you but you need the other genes from ancestors to come to that conclusion as definite.\n Also isn't it more weird to think they'd both cheat on a talkshow host(Danny) and a band member(Jesse) for Joey the cartoony comedian. Plus the fact that they got blonde haired actors on purpose to make it harder to forget their mother and so they each had a part of her, to torment Danny and Jesse, by having a constant reminder of her. If you want to discuss a theory at least think it out first.
or MAYBE ITS A FUDGEING SITCOM!
My dad has dark hair, my mom has light hair, and my 2 brothers and I all have blonde hair...
So what... I'm white... My wife is white... And all 5 of my kids are black.  It's called recessive genes people!
Daym.. Joey gettin more pussay than a toilet seat!
😦
Cut-It-Out.
DaAM
Joey is a playrrr
Jeez Cracked. Get a life
Great scott!
Gave 'em the Mr. Woodchuck, eh?
???????
Joey fucks
Cuke suntane
That bastard!
Shut up
I have aids
59k and trending????
School Is pretty much exactly the same now
3:36 the textbook says 1D AF whoever wrote that. Same
I actually am watching this instead of writing an essay.
This was the most realatable thing I have ever watched
I'm in year 11 and that is the exact same as my primary and secondary school
we used to get changed in the classroom too!!
P.E. Lessons are the same you just get given one of those fuck off hard ass blue mats to DO forward FUCKING rolls on 😂😂
I just relived my childhood in a video 😂 and tbh schools haven't changed that much since 😂
Yes my school was very similar. I guess that was just the way it was in the UK the past decades...
i'm in year 11 and that's still literallyy my school to the tee
Am I the only one that likes moremarcus better than the main channel
I had to change in the classroom for PE  up until year six. We had a changing room and all, just didn't use it for some reason.
I'm 14 and we still have all of that crap haha.
I'm in year 10 now and can confirm that school's are still exactly the same as this
School is the exact same now. Well mine is at least
Exactly like my high school which has now been knocked down and houses are now there
My school looks like hog warts it was built in 1677 but it's just a normal school, not a private school
This is literally primary school and I'm only 15 now
We had to change for p.e in the classroom  up until year 6
,y school is very so al
School is shit still lol
had to change like that in the classroom up until year 6 it was so awkward😂
Lol I'm 14 and the only thing that wasn't the same as yours was we have smart boards. We also got changed in classrooms until year 4 and then girls got changed in the cloakroom and boys in the classroom, so yeah primary school was shit😂
These things were only in my primary school, secondary school was much better
No in my old primary school which was 3 years ago exactly the same but now just in the small space of time everything has changed
when we went to the computer rooms to do mymaths but we didnt actually do anything😂
Its sad to see great youtube legends channel dying..but people like the Pauls Rise ..Smh
Ohh my god this is soooo relatable!!!
I ticked everything 😂
Wtf is a desert plate?
I'm doing homework 😂😂😂
4:20 me 😂
Still the same tbh
My school is like this in 2017
nah man the schools are still shit
My year changed in our classroom when we were younger too - probably just a weird british thing
Marcus school is still the fucking same
Yeah it is weird that kids up until year 7 age 13 get changed to get her (boys and girls) in the classroom and like all schools in my area do that
my school was still children changing in a class room before me and my friends as a laugh said the boys were pervs xDD
literally the same memories of primary school and what's happening at my secondary school and I'm 15,Marcus things haven't really changed😂😂
Literally relatable to almost all of them 😂
I've literally just left year 11 and my school is still like that wth 😂 my school is a shit hole tho 😂
I was born in 2004, and my schools are exactly like this...
The gym mats. Getting dressed in the classrooms   The gym shoes. The old tv.   I'm 14 and relate big time.  Also the paper towels
I had a radiator behind me in one of my classes and the room was always freezing so i used to swing back on my chair and just chill there with my arm on it to keep me warm, so cotch
React to why don't we!!!!
Is it sad that I just left primary school this year and my primary school was the same as all others and I would pretend to wet the paper towel so I  could keep getting up to wet it again and not have to really listen
Omg I go to school now and all of the stuff is still exactly the same and so relatable
Until year 4 we all had to get changed in the classroom and one time one kid pulled down his pants as well as his trousers. And I'm in year 10 and we still use the cgp books. But they make us buy them ourselves. And Marcus, school is still as crappy now. Basically all of these apply to me!
You never showed the results
Me news a bit better but Yh most of that is relatable, I'm year7 in secondary school😴 love ur videos tho Marcus xxx
yep my schools were the same
This is the most relatable thing ever! I'm 20😂
1:07 my reaction to everything in life 🌚
I was so nervous to watch this because of how much I used to dread school. 😥\nAnd Up to year 5 boys and girls changed together in the classroom 😵😳
At your big age you still making school vids run out of content then 🤷‍♀️
I actually am meant to be doing homework 😂😂
I'm 15 and 98% of that was my primary school and now my secondary
i was legit rocking on my chair exactly when he mentioned it
I'm still in school now and I can relate to most of these. Idk whether it's because I'm Australian and we still haven't 'caught up' yet but 🤷🏻‍♀️
Some of these are relatable even for Australia in the 90s & 00s
my high school opened in 1871 and we only had those radiator heaters which only were turned on during the winter and then turned off after lunch it was absolotely freezing
That may have been your school but that was my primary lol relatable
Literally still looks the same
I had to go to the head-teachers office because I threw blue paper towels at the ceiling and missed the bell for the next lesson😁
When I was in primary school we had to change in the classrooms until we were about 10, and then finally the girls got sent to the toilets and the boys just got changed in the class still 😂😂
Schools aren't different at all I promise you 100 %
I'm Year 11 and I relate to nearly all of them! So strange how considering i'm 15, our school was similar lol
Man feeling like a posh boy haven't seen one I relate to XD
Was I the only one that was at that posh private school around the corner 😕
The most relatable thing i have actually ever seen
I'm 13 and the majority of these things remind me of primary school so much 😂
We had to do changed in class room
Literally both my primary and secondary school. So funny looking back at it now 😂
Really wanna know what school Marcus went to
Schools are literally still like this
I'm in yr 7 I RELATE SO FUCKING MUCH
Is it just my school that lets you got out for lunch? Also in my primary everyone has to change together till like P6/Year 6  thinking about it now it's so weird😂
Im quite lucky i went to a good achool
Most of these things still happen now!!
I can relate to everything, my primary had everything on this list!! And I'm only in S4 (Year 11)
We used to throw wet paper towels at the windows or if the windows where open we would aim for the younger kids hahah
In my primary school all the boys and girls were in the same classroom getting dressed until the end of year 6😂😂There was no changing rooms😂😂
im 16 and i went to primary school from 2005- 2012 and then secondary school from 2012-2017 and my schools was exactly the same as this so things cant of changed that much cuz i could relate to every single thing on that list.
I moved to England and started year 10 here. My school was made last year and it's really good
These all still apply to school now lol
I'm watching this instead of homework
I'm in year 10 now bad this is sooooooo relatable 😂🙄
That first school is my school
its sad i'm only 15 and i can relate to all of these :D
i got changed in my classroom until year 5 - the girls hated it!
I'm watching this instead of homework 😂😂
So many reminded me of my primary school not even kidding
marcus, school in your day and school now are literally exactly the same.\n\nit's still shit
When I was in primary, I had to get changed in the class in front of everyone till year 6😩
He went to shoreham college, that’s my one lol
I'm 13 and my school practically has all of these!!
We go swimming and all get changed in the same room
Marcus I swear your old school is like mine now 😂 It is that 60's brick building and it is getting knocked down soon to be remade into a more modern school, but the younger years are like You'll miss out on seeing the new school building, you'll be out of school when it's been built! 😂
Haha, so many people would already know everything that will happen in this series.
Whose voice is it?
Meh... but, is this series canon now?
Anyone else want a narrative/lore like this on Rhaegar's p.o.v about what happened before/during Robert's rebellion?
If this is a possible spin off will there be animated rhaenys sex?
First, House Durrandon's sigil was a rampant stag with a crown, the crown was removed after the battle of the conquest, only to be added back by Robert after the rebellion. Second, The Martells din't rule Dorne because no one wanted the desert. Their full name is House Nymeros Martell of Sunspear, which indicateds their liniage back to Nymeria the Rhoynar queen who took Lord Mors Martell as her husband when she fled Rhyone after it was taken over by the Valyrians.  The Dornish are the only people to withstand the conquest of Aegon and his sisters, thus retaining their Prince/Princess status. Just because the show-runners don't have Indira Varma to show off, doesn't mean Dorne is a crap wasteland
Can someone subtitling it in Spanish?
Hey sorry to be annoying but I just started my YouTube channel and if you could spare a little time to watch my first video about Game Of Thrones that would be great! \nVideo : https://youtu.be/kgIKYSAvlUA
now....hold on a sec... did i hear it right? even the dragons were burned? i thought Dany said fire cannot kill a dragon?
Am i the only one who wished that Peter Dinklage narrated this?  A few commentaries had his sass in the voice lol
These comments make me want to sell crack to orphans.
Give credit to Harry Lloyd.
Is it possible that Aegon is the god of fire ?
weekly priority place changing french her alliance merely inspection
What songs are used in this video?
Let's be serious! Highgarden looks way better than in the show!
Does anyone know the name of the soundtrack from 3:16 till the end?
I want this animated series, please
Why have they released this now they normally Waite until the DVD comes out.
Anyone know who is narrating this? This is frickin' awesome. Combined with; what sounds like; Ramin Djawadi's music, I got goosebummps as soon as it started. OMG! I would #BeAllOver an *_ASoIaF_* animated series/movie/shorts, etc. Kudos, HBO.
I can't wait to see the rest!
Aegon's Sister were hot.
They definitely have to make a prequel of GOT, oh please, please. Kind of like Harry Potter and Fantastic Beast AWTFT.
More likely, Aenar met with some mishap at court and chose exile over execution. \n\nYou literally just spoke of an empire built on wonder and marvel, dragons soaring in the sky, sorcery constructing cities of amazement, and you find visions improbable? Oh, Viserys. You lovable fool.
THANK YOU! AT LAST! PLEASE DO MORE!!!
I hope they are testing the waters for a full scale animated spin-off. Animation isn't cheap but with all the effects already put into GoT, I _imagine_ good animation can still be a lot cheaper than live action. That should open up for more creativity.
I just love Harry Lloyd's narration 😍 His reading of Dunk and Egg stories was just amazing
Is the doom of Valyria a mirror of pompeii?
Is that Harry Lloyd reading?
Ruled by great families who didn't know what greatness was, Aegon would teach them
I got lost into this world and video so deeply it didn't feel like a 4 min video, more like 2. This was so good.
And this is why I love the Targaryens 💯
Is the narrator the guy who plays Viserys? It just really sounds like him.
So it's the rise and fall of the Roman Empire withe DRAGONS??? COOL!!!
Reminds me of the story of Atlantis.
Can't wait to watch the rest of these on some obscure youtube channel!
It took my awhile to realise this is Viserys's voice. Damn
Can't wait for more incest!!!!
They could honestly make seven more seasons of prequels to the GoT stories exploring the rich history of the world that GRRM has built.
Game of Thrones will soon become the greatest fantasy franchise of all time, it will break all records, & when it is done, StarWars, Harry Potter & LOTR, will look nothing but mediocre!!!
That dragon model seemed oddly similar to skyrims dragons
Well... That's look pretty ugly and not so fine about history. That pilot made by a fan was way better to be honest:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFDOdhVAJg
Who the hell narrates this? It doesn't quite sound like Viserys, is it Rhaegar?
It was the casterlys who hold the westerlands when aegon came to westeros and aegon burned the casterlys and gardeners and 10000 men whos swords make the iron throne
Thank you for this. I am a big fan of the show.
This is nice. I would say, though, that there's a slight detail with the information: the Targaryens didn't build Dragonstone, it was already there, as the westernmost outpost of the Valyrian Freehold.
Dis is all mind blowing, u guys should pls make a game from this, or something, a game where winter comes every December, and we can choose our houses, cos dere is only one season left and I don't want to ever forget u guys, just like everyone forgot abt Lord of the rings, and pls not a telltale game pls
I really hope with all my heart that its a sign of a spin off
House Arryn held the Vale. Or Rather the Vale held them. His voice tho' <3
Is this a hint of an Aegon's Conquest/Old Valyria prequel? :o

Hint to a spin off?
Viserys reading bedtime stories to his sister

At this point it really shouldn't be that hard for them to know what we want from this channel. The latest Rep the Realm video has 1000 likes and 4000 dislikes. This video has 50000 likes and fewer than 500 dislikes.
Am I the only one who preferred the animated histories and lore when they were hand-drawn? This move to lazy, cheap 3D animation is an awful trend.\n\nI DO however still love these, and its nice that they keep bringing back relevant characters and their actors to voice them.

you should set up a 'shit cam' live stream to catch the cat that is shitting on the sofa.
These comments are disgusting, Syndicate donates money to charity and helps people, then you guys be pricks. Btw 3 of the people so far are Jake paulers, cancer.

Lydia is back!!!!
Every Vlog from now on I am going to write this <3 Day 169!
Not really spoilers when the movie is a remake
Awesome vlog great to see Lydia is doing okay👍😎👌
i said ages ago when the knee pain started to occur that it was patella tendinitis, and i was correct 😂
Tom just get a blanket or something to cover the couch until the cats stop pooping
The return of Lydia
The Movie IT is just chapter 1
The film wasn't made to be scary as hell..it was made to tell the story of the losers club! Like in the bloody book. Getting right tired of people seeing this film because they thinks it's just another horror film. It's so much more than that
Tom just get a throw for the sofa's so it dont go on the sofa!
Allice you are good looking ant thats not in the creepy wierd sub way
Tom get another box or 2 cats are very territorial
Bullshit
You are a really pretty girl Alice! Don't put your self down. Do I have to take you to Specksavers?
Yooo it's trending
What is Alice's instagram?
4th on trending wow 👌
#4 trending gg tom
Lol @trending getting triggered, luv ya Tom
to make your cats stop pooping on the sofa, get another cat litter box. Cats usually prefer their own litter box and if they are pooping on your sofa, they're letting you know.\n1
If you have a room that you're not using, you should put a load of cat stuff in it, and when yer out put them in that room and close the door😃
I like how Tom has a gymshark hoodie on but he never goes to the gym ;)
I don't know why I dislike toms cats so much but I do
So does syndicate not upload gaming videos anymore or is he just busy? Just curious if anyone knows
Hope you have cancer

Is your sister single? She low key pretty.
Life of Tom do you live in Glasgow
i have tendonitis in my right knee it sucks btw
What movie did he watch?
For real tho, maybe you should chill with the twitch sub shoutouts. I get that it's something nice you want to do for loyal twitch fans (and keep doing it if you do please) but as someone whose been watching since when LoT was Syndicate Central, it's kind of annoying and disrupts the vlogs...
I tore a ligament in my knee almost a year ago and it was meant to be healed months ago but I still have to get an MRI scan
tom! if you put tin foil on the couch while you're not using it the cats will stay off of it saving your couch!!
Love the old British Vloggers
Tom, I always love your VLOGS. Just classic and EPIC
Why is everyone hating on Tom and the video because it's trending? It just means a lot of people are watching it that's it.
Does anybody else have trouble loading the merch link. I've been trying to get a sweatshirt for days but the link won't work.

The iPhone X shouldn't actually be £1000 apple just decided to charge that amount it should be about £750

You need to take some editing classes to make your vids more exciting to watch
Yo tom you need to start telling off the kittens and 'punishing' them for doing bad things, not punishing badly just like telling them off and stuff. We did it to our cat and now it hasn't shit on the Sofa for like 3 years

Ridley's First Film With TriStar Pictures
omg is this about gigi gorgeous's girlfriends family ?
is that a true story?
Song:  Zombies - Time of the season
now THIS is a movie I'd watch!
Nice to see Wahlberg playing an actual character.
Yep. Pay one ransom. It will happen again. People forget that. jrichardsingleton.blogspot.com
jesus christ, mark wahlberg is fucking everywhere these days. hes like the new rock
There's no fucking way that's Kevin Spacey! He looks so different!!!
; This motion-picture does a great disservice to J. Paul Getty, and, obviously, what else can one expect from liberal, anti-Capitalist, nin-com-poops?\n\nAs someone who was a young adult during this time, and watched it happen on television, and in the news-papers, J. Paul Getty couldn't pay the ransom, ( Although, later, he did pay a portion of the ransom money. ), because it would put any other of his family members at risk for kidnapping, or worse forms of extortion, i.e., Criminals are never satisfied, and will repeat the same stupidity, because criminals are insane.
WOW looks awesome..
Lizard people
Your grandfather was Mansa Musa?
Mark Wahlberg is my favorite actor
Finally, something with a descent story line.
simply they told us all the story
whats the name of this song playing during the trailer????
i felt like i watched the whole movie...imagine the last scene of the trailer is the ending ...nothing  -plot twist!
i love watching people with more money than me buy stuff i'll\ntake 83 tickets
Like Hillary Clinton, having all the money and didnt win the elections... a dream that never happend...
First thing I thought of was Gettysburg.
Rothschilds have all the money but their net worth is unpublished
Lamorris Walker on Facebook is the next best actor rising
Be quiet about your wealth and avoid these situations.
The song in the beginning is called time of the season by Zombies
I didn't even recognize Spacey until they said it was him!
the boy who was kidnapped planned the whole thing
Will watch this movie for Kevin Spacey! <3
This trailer looks like crap to be honest. Walhberg or Mr Rich is the mastermind behind this kidnapping... as to what happens in between is neither here nor there.
Prob going to see this in theater
The trailer does an amazing job of making you want to know what happens in the movie.\nI don't really watch movies much at all, but this is one I might actually go see.\nHe says he'd pay nothing to get his grandson back, so I need to know by what means he gets his grandson back, if at all.\n\nWell played Sony
Is that Tom Cruise narrating this trailer?  Sure sounds like him to me.

I like how everyone changed their accent but mark
Mark Wahlberg is Mr Propaganda at the moment. Boston Bombing CHECK. Gulf Oil Disaster CHECK. Improving the image of Billionaire businessmen CHECK. What's next scumbag
What's with these trailers that got these fast highlights at the beginning? It's fucking retarded man.
We've pretty much just watched the whole story throughout the movie, thanks trailer!

They are all entitled to NOTHING!
At first, when the narrator in the beginning said, It's like we're from another planet. I thought it was a movie about the rothschilds. And I thought, the reptilian CGI, better be impeccable!!! But still COOL TRAILER, definitely give a watch!
We [the super rich] look like you but we're not like you is a profound statement
If I didn't know better I would've thought that man was an old Bruce wayne in a live action film.

That's how Donald trump will say if his grandson got kidnap 😩 How much money will you release to your grandson nothing 👏
I should've became an actor! U know what....I think I'll focus on becoming one. Headed to central casting!!
Anyone know the song?
WOW AMAZING STORY. I hope Michelle gets an Oscar or something for this role. She looks amazing.
Maybe ya'll will now get an idea how easily it will be for the jew IlluminAti to throw those who follow them under the bus.
topher grace from that 70's show is that you?
It seems like they gave away too much now. Mark may find a way to get Getty's son back?
At 1:15 they say the title of the movie.👍
saw this as an ad, and I just had to see it again.
Looked like a good film, then mark whalburg showed up
well since its sony i bet 500$ IT WILL FAIL AT THE BOX OFFICE
Lol I got 20$ on my pocket😁
I've lost all faith in Ridley.
17 million is pocket change when it comes to the actual wealthy
Wahlberg always has that same WTF is happening expression on promotional stills. 😨😱😵
Did they remix part of the original Zombies - Time of the Season just for this trailer or is there a full version of the remix?
Looks good, i like the remix of the song.
I would build a USS Enterprise - How about you ?
They kinda told the story in the trailer.
What? They manage to kidnap the grandson of the richest man in the history of humanity and ask for 17 million? Yeah that's a lot but c'mon might as well as for a few billion dumbass
I saw mark whalburg in the thumbnail I was like oh no everyone shut up ima watch this
Sony making a good film?
As soon as I was Kevin spacey I said I got to watch this
Didn't know this was a based on a true story, just watched a youtube video on the his grandson. By the sounds of it though i think j Paul Gerry set up for his grandson to be kidnapped to give him more limelight. His grandson sure was made to suffer thanks to his greedy selfish grandad, Hope he had a horrible death. Can not wait to see this movie for sure 😀
is this a true story
If Getty was the richest man to ever live then Trump is a close second!\nGiven Getty would have an adjusted Net worth of $8.3B today this just isn't close to being true, Mansa Musa is the wealthiest person in history at $400B adjusted, Rockefeller the wealthiest in modern history at $330B adjusted.
Nothing
I really hate the few seconds of preview for the trailer in the beginning. I DONT NEED A PREVIEW OF A TRAILER DUMBASS
The kid is released six months after being kidnapped by some italian mafia. The kid goes to new york and becomes a heroin addict. He dies at 54. Boom saved you from another mark walhberg movie.
Lol I had thought the trailer ended at 0:06
Grandpa is savage af
dude said NOTHING....lol
Mark Wahlberg👌👌👌👌👍👍🙌

So confused on wtf this movie is about
Kimmich the assist man!
Wait robben has a right foot?
I saw Rudy's attempt live on T.V. and I was in shock. If that would have gone in, it would have been one of the best goals this season...
Coman has so so so much potential! \nIm glad we are back to winning ways.  \nAlso nice to see other teams putting up a fight,  makes the league interesting.  (:
Rudy's volley would've been spectacular
3 assists from Kimmich!
Adler conceding vs Bayern: better love story than Twilight
Y James ? 😂😂
Bayern wins the champions league don't @ me bruh!
he does have a right foot
rudy deserves starting xi .
Ancelotti has to imprive the defense. He has 3 of the best 5 CD in the world with Hummels, Boateng and Martinez. But Ancelotti is not able to stabalize the defense. Sometimes the defense is just terrible. Thiago is not a good 6 he is a better 10 because he does not win many tackles. Ancelotti has not found the best 11 just yet and has to improve the defense.

Now can Dortmund fans shut up and stop saying heja Dortmund top of the league we are the best
How would Bayern perform if they were in the Premier League?
Bayern could have won by like 8 - 0 that game
Kimmich has great potential he is only 21 and has a great career upcomimg
Neymar, Draxler, Mbappe, Cavani will not miss these opportunities
Muller = Deflection specialist.
Also hating fashion lately, it seems everything is designed for women who are size 6 and love slogans :/ the best clothes currently are unfortunately the more expensive such as french connection etc. Because high street fashion isn't too forgiving right now!
Louise your make up looks fab. Slay girl! Xx
I don't think I told you this nor have you ever noticed me but I am super proud of you. This was random but meh.
What product are you wearing as your contour/bronzer? So pretty 😍
Hufflepuff here. I get clothes from modcloth because they have a lot of the 50's inspired fit and flare dresses that fit my pear shaped body (and that I've always found lovely.)
I am a ravenclaw
I was thinking the same thing the other day about bows. Came to the same conclusions...lol...just turned 31. Gryffindor!
I'm also sick of 90s fashion, just not a fan of the loud colors
I want 50's fashion, maybe some 70's. I quite like the 70's sleeves that are puffy. New look is okay at the moment but I went to primark and there was just nothing that I liked!
I loooooveee the fashion at the moment!!! A few years ago I felt the same as you, with the skaterskirt thight highwasted shorts and croptops. Just wasn't my style. This year I looovvee it!!
I'm a hufflepuff
I bought that candle for my kids teachers leaving gift along with a few goodies. And I had to buy a few for myself. I am also a candle snob! So was shocked at those too. Xxx
I love your sense of humour 👌🏼😂
I just got to the UK for study abroad and now these primark hauls are dangerous. Must not buy tons of cute things I can't bring home.
I want everything that has Beauty and the Beast related stuff on it - I.e. Chip! I love it 😍😍
I don´t like fashion at the moment. I don´t even get excited about shopping anymore. I can´t seem to find anything I like when I go in a store. I really love classy and more elegant clothing, which is totally not practical when working with kids though
I know how you feel when I was pregnant I was wearing Jeggings and vest tops
I really like 90s fashion! Apart from crop tops, I don't see the point of them and who wants to walk around with their belly out?! Love the pink hair by the way!
The best thing I found in primark recently was. Floral Pom Pom throw and also bows like jo jo bows and also a cream hat with multi coloured Pom Pom on it and mojito lip balm and I want the Christmas baubble
I seem to be living out of shops like dotty p's and white stuff because they have less 90s stuff. I need things that don't make me look like a boob/stomach blob!!!
Being a curvy girl, I can not STAND the nineties fashion at the moment. It would seem if you have boobs and a bum there isn't a lot of choice. Maybe I am not looking hard enough, but I do think the nineties clothes should stay in the nineties! P.S I love you.
Hufflepuff all the way <3 So proud to be a Hufflepuff tbh.. I kinda love the fashion of the mo actually. loving the mom jeans vibe and crop tops and such. I do really need to get my get my tummy a bit more into shape to feel 100% confident in them again in summer. I think I actually own more crop tops than regular tops..... love you so much!
I got so excited for the Disney things and the Harry Potter things that I nearly threw up, amazing video. Love it!!!
Slytherin is in the comment!!!!
I like your hair but I think you should not dye your hair when your preggo
Love your hair! I'm a hufflepuff.\nAlso today's fashion doesn't suit me either and I much prefer dresses. I shop online at places like Thunder egg, minimum mouse or Lindy bop. I would love to see you do a 40/50's style look book or haul too!
love all the lighting with copper very nice and love long cardigans....
I got the pink lemonade candle for my birthday and omfg it smells like strawberry Bon-bons
I'm struggling wirh this fashion has a curvier woman .\nI'm obsessed wirh mugs and I'm in love with my bambi mug from primark .\nI love the copper lighting .x
😱 jimmy got that cactus thing too!\nI'm a Hufflepuff! 💛
Love your Primark hauls best, I've missed them.
I don't dress in a very feminine way so I can't comment on the women's clothes very much, but I like the men's 90s fashion and the more neutral trends. I don't like the high waist thing very much coz I'm a tall girl and nothing reaches my waist without giving me a wedgie. I kinda prefer the more grungy androgynous style than whats going on right now
1) Hair is beaut 2) best thing from primark recently(ish) was a set of those acrylic makeup drawers everyone was going batshit over, but for like £4 3) I totally get what you mean about the fashion thing, it's all 90s-baggy or frills-and-flounces-and-puffy-bits that just look odd on a lot of people. I snapped a pic the other day in a store of a top that looked like the classic grandma's-lace curtains next to a skirt made of classic grandma's-old-sofa material. Because obviously looking like a 1970s living room is the next big thing. But at least in autumn we can be guaranteed ankle boots and jumpers, and that's good enough for me!
Absolutely loving the Harry Potter collection in Primark!!!! Deffos heading out for the Christmas baubles!! Gryfindor ♥ 💛
Love the bow and the bauble ps i'm a ravenclaw
Gryffijgdor for days also i need that Hogwarts bauble in my life my mum and I are going to have to go on a prikark spree soon lol
A huffle myself and with you on 1950s - I can't stand most of what's in at the moment?! I don't wanna wear something with that much flesh out thank you very much ;)
Hi \nHow fab you think of your friends when shopping xx
Ravenclaw for me!! Love the hair xx
It's not normal how much I loved this video. You're brilliant 💖
I like the fashion but I don't want to wear it because everyone else is wearing it and I like to look a tad unique <3
I quit like the stripes
Not a big fan of the 90's fashion myself. Totally agree how it just doesn't suit my body shape. Not sure which I would pick but I vote we veto the 90's malarkey
Yes for bows and pink hair!
Louise, you and I are of similar age, so we remember the 90's fashion the first time it was around... haha! I'm not slim either so none of it really suits my body. I'd also like the 1950's to come back because I'd love an excuse to wear a poodle skirt without people thinking I've got on a costume.
I love, love, love that you call Darcy Doodles. That is what I called my youngest too!!!
Never clicked so fast!!!😂💗💗💗💗,I LOVE U LOUISEE💗💗
Primary is legit my second home these days😂
that is a very nice haul
40s or 50s fashion for me xo
I live 2 mins away from rushden lakes!!!!
I got so exited because your pink again 😆😆😆😆
I don't want any fashion to come back. I think we should set our own!
I'm a slytherin 😂🙌🏼🙌🏼
Have you thought about bringing out a maternity range with a figure very similar to you I find it so hard 💕💕💕
This makes me wanna go to primark so bad. Like... right now. OMG
Im a Ravenclaw! I love you and I hope you have great day!
love your hair - the bow will go amazingly!! I gotta say I'm a proud slytherin hehe Xx
I'm with you Louise, not a huge fan of fashion anywhere at the moment, it seems like you really have to hunt for something good, but at least there is always gorgeous homewear x
Your pink hair is absolutely gorgeous!! Fits you so well! Wish I could pull something like that off 😊
Oh dear a i sense a trip to primark coming up on pay day!!
i'm a slytherin 🐍🐍🐍
i love the clothes in the shop atm!! i'm guilty of having a cropped jumper nhl 😂😂 i am obsessed with yellow. i'm a hufflepuff xx
Your pink hair looks amazing but the blonde was bomb 😭❤😂 lol still love your hair tho 😀xx looks very pretty!
I like the whole embroidery trend, although within reason people let's not go head to toe embroidered - but I'm really not a fan of boxy crop tops (or any crop tops really) or knee ripped jeans
I'm 9 months pregnant... what is this fashion you speak of??
Currently off school sick and watching you to feel better :)
You should totally do a video where you take the sorting, wand and patronus quizzes on Pottermore! and btw your hair looks flippin beautiful!
Fashion us horrendous right now for Curvy girls. Bloody nightmare finding anything nice!
Wahhhh you live near Rushden Lakes?! Me too. What do you think? xx
I want all those beauty and the beast things. I wish we had them in Australia!
I'm a Ravenclaw, I don't like frozen either! I'd like 1950's/1960's fashion to return.
Hufflepuff
Fab vlog!\nEmma already has that mug! Xx

Ear rape only feels glorious when Morgan Lemons does it
I’m just gonna say something right now I have been watching your videos for a while now and Hobo Bros too, then I find out there is a collaboration of sm64 with you in it... OH BOY let’s see how it goes when James plays with people that make funny retarded videos!
Since I live in Arizona it would be cool to come across him
my target carries tim tams. :) you should check one near you!
Hey I wonder if you got your captain sparkles shirt and glasses
Can U IDK..\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPLOAD BEFORE IT BECOMES 2 WEEKS
By the way hi
Oh damn, 4 mil subs? Your on your way James.
THEY DO HAVE TIM TAMS IN AMERICA, IN ARIZONA. I LIVE HERE TOO
The cliche Arizonans everyone talks about. Me: ...People talk about.....me?
My name is the odd 1s out
Ya'know what, I want you fellow fans to encourage some of yo favorite youtubbers to bring back the Take On Me thing from last year (because that stuff is pure gold) at the next convention. So right when they make the announcement videos, if they do, or if you know when the next convention is and somehow predict them going, encourage them to try it. Mainly try it with the ones who tend to do goody stuff or do stuff to please the fans.\nBecause lets be honest, who doesn't want to see James walking with his legs bent and his arms swinging side to side
James if you're in australia, you have to go to brisbane and like do a meet n greet cuz if u do, I'm first to buy tickets :D
hey i do animations,music,and gameplay check it out and tell me what you all think...:) thanks for your time:)
I now loved this channel . . . plz keep up the great work.
i come from austrailia (i forgot how  to spell to day)  and i do not know any of these
Hi James--\nI was so happy to see your comics on Pinterest!\nYou are so great at drawing them! You should show some\nIn videos! PS-\nHow was Australia?\n- Typers
JAMES WHERE IS THE ANIMATION STUFF I DONT WHANT TO SEE THIS BOING STUFF.
OMG HE ACTUALLY WAS WITH THE HOBO BROS
I think yo and Jaiden should make a Chanel together where yo discuss bout random topics mixing both art styles called \nJJ cartoons \nJJ stands for Jaiden and James
The only thing it makes me feel is angry\nLiterally EVERY TIME I go the the Moma here in SF \nLike, there are literally canvases painted solid colors\nMy shitty sketches have more effort put into them (ﾉ*ﾟｰﾟ)ﾉ\nSorry I'm really ranty
They do have Tim tams in America
Your Contact Thing isn't working for me on your website :(
make your sister show her face
Jazza you ever tried marmight? Its a love it or hate it spread from England
James! Please Do How You Met SMG4!
0:23   Jazza goes for an arm around the shoulder...realizes it might look gay...loses the nerve. *tOo LaTe. HAHAHA!!! THE YAOI FANGIRLS HAVE RISEN!*\nThen 0:30... James you have made it BEGIN!
*clap clap clap clap clap* \nGood job on 4 million James!
I know this has nothing to do with this but I feel bad because you make a small bit of money because of YouTube
They could be brothers
I am Australian. I knew almost none of these terms! I think I spend too much time on YouTube and Netflix...
James can you help me with a animation.
Hey james! Remember day 8 when u went to france (i think) and you had this clock in a strawberry i saw that alot of people said Y because of the clock had a Y shape. But also alot of people said B, because strawberry is a berry (which is very obvious) and it starts with a B. I also wanted to tell you...           what it the answer??? \n\n\n\n\n\nI FEEL LIKE IM GOING TO GET ALOT OF LIKES\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd wasted about 5 minutes with this comment and I have to do homework 😅
Does the Aussie guy even live in Australia? Some of his definitions are a bit off, and he even said something about using a stubby holder to keep your hand from getting cold. That might be it's purpose in like Alaska or something.
hey James I really like the vid and I wanted to know what the software u use to make your animations
Idk if im late but.. \nYou hit 4 Mill congrats!!
anyone e else watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pv4tUau1H0 when he played with hobo bros
James did you really play super Mario 64 with hobo Bros. Because I watched the video and I want to know if it's true
I'm just waiting for James to talk about VidCon so I can see SMG4 drawn, TheOdd1sOut style.
At 12:14 look at the subtitles...
Hey hey make a normal story vid.
Lol depending on what area you live in, you speak differently. Not all Australians talk like that FYI
I love you vids have a great day im a big fan theodd1sout pls look at this i been on this channel will have a great day
Are you gonna do a Pinewood Derby animation? You mentioned it in a video you did before, and I was wondering what is was.
Credit to the camera guy in the back.👏👏
I live in Western Australia
wow canada is similar to austrailia
M A T E
I don't live there n az
for real I went through the top half of these youtube comments and could only find 3 Australians! like where are all my aussie at?
Congrats on 4 million James! Time for 4 million sprinkles BOI!
I’m Australian and I most of these words I won’t mention on a day to day basis. lol
Odd ones out you almost surpassed domics how dose it feel
https://youtu.be/up8J2q0RRKU\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think this represents James well! 😂
THIS IS AN AUSTRALIAN SERVER, U HAVEN'T  CURSED ENOUGH!!!1!1!1!!
This man collabed with SMG4 (the HoboBros channel) and some guy named Awesome on SM64 Online and didn't tell us WHAT A LEGENDARY CROSSOVER
I'm sure very few people will see this but I just want to say JAMES THANKS FOR WEARING MY SHIRT and I will let my friend know that people love the design~
I feel like you're the kind of guy that does read all the comments so lemme say-\nI found your channel the other day on youtube with my girlfriend, we both love your comics! They are hilarious man! Wish I had found you years ago but we both watched them all now! Keep doing what you do, awesome job!
Why do you look like faze blaziken
you are glowing <3
You look amazing Fleur and the nursery looks lovely, you have a very lucky baby! I love watching these vlogs, I have two girls now 8 and 11 but still love watching these and remembering the excitement of having a baby! Xxx
Hi Fleur, loving the baby bump, you look lovely. My belly button is pierced and I used one of those little twist type bars (spiral) and it didn't pull at all until right to the end. I took it out about a month before and then just pushed a bar through each day and took it right out. After the baby was born I put my belly bar back in as normal. Would totally recommend the spiral bars for comfort (although not the most pretty). Xx
You're so beautiful!! Thank you for sharing!!
what lipstick you use in this vedio？
omg, the jumper, the lip, i was literally shocked when i clicked the video open!!! you are so pretty !!!!!
The piercing... My friend took her piecing out and put a length of fishing line in and tied beads on both ends. Totally flexible and bump grows around it
Belly button ring...Yes it marks!! And it grows back so fast. You will have to get it re-pierced!! Ugh, I hate getting my belly button pierced-again }: lol... advice from a mom of three- time goes by so fast, so fast- enjoy EVERY SINGLE SECOND, even the hard stuff. x
I have successfully kept 2 kids alive ;)  The biggest recommendation I give every new mom (or the gift if you're my friend) is a book by Gary Ezzo - On Becoming Babywise: Giving Your Infant the Gift of Nighttime Sleep - It helped us all sleep through the night and have proper food intake.  IT WORKS - the advise in this book is the best! It's still available on Amazon.   Congrats
That's what I've used http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Flexible-Pregnancy-Maternity-Belly-Bars-Clear-Ends-/171798408693?epid=1131803126&hash=item27fffbadf5:g:iFAAAOxybetR9U0I
Hi Fleur! I am also 23 weeks! I wonder if we have the same due date! I am due on January 13th... when are you due?
Hi fleur, just wanted to comment, be cause you look amazing, so please don't feel self conscious. I Have had two babies and have my belly pierced. I got one of those plastic belly ring and started wearing it from about 20 weeks. My piercing hasn't stretched also it didn't chafe or get irritated at all. It was quite comfy really. Also just wanted to say that not everyone gets that line of hair on their bump. I didn't anyway. So glad you are enjoying your pregnancy now. You are positively glowing!!! Xxxx
I just thought, you can buy pregnancy belly button rings so that might be something worth looking into :)
I had a belly button piercing for my 1st pregnancy.  I kept the ring in, until it started to annoy me and irritate my skin and then I took it out.  I put it back in a little bit after the baby was born and didn't have any issues with it closing up, scarring or causing any extra stretching.  I think it all depends on your skin, so if it looks like it's causing an issue, maybe take it out sooner than later.  Good luck!!
I heard cot bumpers are dangerous?
Haha awww loved this!!!❤️🙏🏼
🎀 future best dressed baby girl 🎀
https://youtu.be/lUxDI8xjvpU here you go fleur 😘
U look adorable!!!!
😙❤😙
Yay bonds!
Cutest bump! :0]
Get a pregnancy bar
💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
You look amazing! Glowing xxx
Hi Fleur, when a friend of mine was pregnant, she was also worried about her bellybutton piercing. She found one of those really long flexible bars and moisturised the area with coconut oil to stop the scarring/stretching, and she had no problems whatsoever!
I'm 34 weeks now and at our 4D scan our baby girl had her arm over her face too!!
I just took my piercing out once it became uncomfortable. It's unlikely it'll close over in 3months xx
Hi fleur, I took my belly button piercing out while I was pregnant because I was scared it would split! I had it re pierced after I had my baby but the piercer told me that there was no need to of taken it out as it would of been fine. So I think it's down to personal preference and how it feels as you bump grows. Hope that was helpful xxx
Where are the black and white musslin cloths from?
You look so wonderful!! We love watching YOU, not just for the content, but because it's you! You can put anything up and I'd still watch it! ❤️🇧🇷
Fleur, Have you ever heard of KT tape? I have a bad back and my baby was sitting really low in my pelvis as it was was aching really badly during the final trimester. I put KT tape on and the discomfort was hardly noticeable. When I took it off I could feel it again! You can put the tape on your belly to lift the weight off your pelvis and or your back. \n\nI also had my belly button pierced. I took it out when it started to catch on my clothes. I would put it back in occasionally to make sure it didn't close. After I had my son I put it back in.  But i noticed when I was breastfeeding my son would lean against me it would make indentations on his body from where he was resting. The skin definitely stretched so I took it out and am waiting for my belly skin to return to normal and to lose some weight before I put it back in again.
So excited for you Fleur! You are glowing. Your bump looks so cute. When I was pregnant only used coconut oil on my bump and drank lots of water and ate healthy and I have no stretch marks at all. I was massive ( gained about 30kg haha ) so my advice is keep well hydrated and healthy from the inside and moisturise from the outside. ( I haven't got piercing tho)  \nSending lots of love xx
I loved the video althoug I am just eighteen years old and not ready to have kids for a very long time...by the way: you looked gorgeous in the video!
I took mine out and left it out....  I was scared it would tear my skin.
Fleur, I for some reason have no maternal instinct whatsoever, I think mine has been directed into loving dogs more than babies.....I know, I can't help it!!  HOWEVER.....you are the first and only YouTuber that I am genuinely happy to watch throughout your pregnancy and so very pleased for you!!!!   xxx
I'm honestly super duper excited about #babyDeForce and thank you for letting us be a part of this!! These videos are so much fun to watch (don't get me wrong, I do also love your other videos) and I can't wait for more happy videos! I wish you guys all the best from Belgium :)
I've had 2 babies, had my belly pierced when I was 16. When I had my 1st pregnancy I intended to keep my piercing in for as long as possible but I quickly becomes really uncomfortable. I took mine out, and now have a big v shaped stretch mark coming out of it. I intended to put it back in / get it re pierced but to be honest I don't ever get my tummy out any more, so don't really feel the need to have it done again! Someone I know tried a maternity bar but found it just as uncomfortable as having their normal one in when they got much bigger, so took it out
This video was totally adorable! The nursery looks so great so far!
You can get special bars for during pregnancy, they r really long fleur. I work in shop that used to sell them x
You're super beautiful Fleur! Enjoy your pregnancy! I loved every minute and now my bubba is 2! X
You are so beautiful! I have never seen an expectant mom glow as much as you. Thanks for sharing this joy filled journey with us. It has been 17 years since my last baby, 22 since my first (!) was born and all the memories come rushing back to me as I'm watching you. I also adore your non-traditional choice for clothing and nursery colors. So stunning.
For the belly button piercing you can get a flexible rod, and after your belly has gone back to normal u can wear fun piercings again. Good luck :)
You seem SO happy it's lovely to watch! ❤️ Love the colour scheme you've picked for your nursery. I took out my belly button piercing before my bump got very big and it has left a scar now, but I'm sure that would have happened anyway! I'm contemplating whether to get it pierced again to try and cover up the damage 😂
I had my little prince 5 weeks ago and since the first day Ewan the Dreamsheep has been an absolute favorite! I would highly recomend getting something that makes these whitenoise/womb sounds. And don't only prepare for the birth but for the time afterwards(breastfeeding, baby care etc) 😊
Hey Fleur! I have my belly button pierced and had a baby 2 years ago, and managed to save it without getting any stretch marks by using a long flexible bar until the very last weeks, when my belly button popped out (I went on a week past due date...). As soon as it felt uncomfortable I took the bar out, and spent the last 3 weeks without anything, then put the flexible bar back after I went back from the hospital, then a regular piercing banana when my tummy looked okay for it (and damn it felt good !!!) I hope it helps, and I wish you a wonderful end of pregnancy, smooth birth, and a great mom life. Love !!!
The chair you were sitting in cost £1055.  :0 I want thwe chair but I can't afford that ;(
Not sure if someone has already commented this... But you can buy maternity belly bars. They are basically much longer and often plastic so they are much softer. My step mom wore one in both her pregnancies and it worked great for her. I think they're pretty cheap online x
You can get pregnancy belly bars.
For your hip, get those round big balls and do some hip stretches on them.
you seriously look so good being pregnant fleur! : )only a few months away till the day your baby comes into the world, eeek! : ) i still predict she'll come either on christmas eve or christmas day, just saying : )
I would take the piercing out now. The whole is already actually going to be expanding a bit. Nothing bad, but you'll just end up with a slightly more obvious whole afterwards if you leave it in any longer.
I left my belly ring in during the whole time during both of my pregnancy's
Anyone knows the name of the company for the black and white muslin cloths?
I am fleur de force fan for life! I am so excited for you. Keep the nursery and pregnancy videos coming! I LOVE YOU!
When my mum was pregnant with my 2 siblings, she just took her piercing out when it got really tight and the skin started to stretch.. and afterwards she was able to just put it normally back in, so I wouldn't really worry about it if I were you :)
What is that lip color?! 😊
You should a sugar cookie name reveal
I'm not pregnant and whilst I love kids the thought of having a kid is not something that interests me but I love love love these vlogs, I suffer with depression and whenever I'm feeling down I come back to these vlogs because they just make me so happy it's honestly so cute seeing your progress, how happy you are and how glowing you are and it's also really relaxing so just eases my mind. You look absolutely stunning as per usual so try not to worry too much xx
beautiful baby bump mommy de force! Really enjoying watching the experience!
Awww, you're positively glowing! Lovely baby bump, am so glad everything is going well for you with your pregnancy. I've had two babies and kept my piercing in for the first as long as I could before switching to a silicone bar. I soon had to take it out though as, for me, it was uncomfortable. My piercing closed up so now we have had our second, and are probably not going to have another, I am gearing up to go and have it pierced again. I had pelvic and back pain too with my youngest, I found warm baths and bouncing on a gym ball really helped :) xxx
I never got the line that goes up the belly. So don't be surprised if you don't.
I took my piercing out at 30 weeks because I would catch things on it. I tried to put it back in after and even bought a smaller gauge bar but it had closed over already. My only stretch mark was the skin in between the two holes, above my belly button! It's unavoidable I'd say. About 6 months later the stretch mark was barely noticeable and 11 months later I can't see it unless I really look!
Looking gorgeous!!! You can also get a maternity belly bar to keep you going xxx
I have my belly button pierced and I did take the ring off during the second trimester. My skin stretched a little around the piercing area and my belly button changed shape too so I don't really feel comfortable putting the ring back. However, the hole is still there so I can put the ring back if I want to. Wish you all the best with your pregnancy :) You look fab!
I have just today found out that I'm pregnant and I was hoping you could do your current pregnancy skin care routine?
put thick fishing line thru the belly  button piercing its fexible and will keep the hole open.
hahaha when you said That's my naked belly bump in a wierd voice it cracked me right up xx
What's on your lips? X
you can get a baby bump belly bar
Some stores sell pregnancy belly rings that are a lot longer
Ahhhh just saw this didn't know you were pregnant !!!! So happy for you xxx
You look incredible Fleur! You have such a glow to you xx
i havent had kids before and i have not intrest in having kids (im in a same sex relationship) but i would advice on peircing you could get a long flexi bar if u really want to keep ur belly done
Fleur, you're so adorable! You're really the cutest. And you look beautiful, happiness and your baby bump suit you very very well. My only tip is to enjoy every single minute of what you are living. Sending love 💕
Where did you get the faux fur rug from?
Yes. Take out the piercing. It will stretch. Eventually, the bottom hole will be completely visible.
You look amazing and I love the nursery ❤️
how come I feel like Fleur's voice has changed? haha her voice is more soft now..
You look stunning Fleur ! I can imagine it can be hard to adjust to all the changes your body is going through so I understand you can get a bit insecure sometimes but truly from where we're looking you are so so beautiful and specially looking super happy!! All my best wishes 😍😀😁😚
For your piercing, ask a piercer what they'd advise you. There is special jewelry for expecting moms, but it may depend on your anatomy whether it would work or not.
You look gorgeous, Fleur, you're glowing ! Love the little bump :D
I love your vlogs! I hope to have a family some day soon and its nice to see other people's experiences. Loving the relaxed chatty vibe of these and I completely understand you superstitions, I think I would be the same! xx
You look amazing Fleur. I can't wait to see how the dogs are with the baby. I had an English Springer Spaniel and they are the most loving, affectionate dogs who in my experience are so gentle and caring towards humans x
You look great! With my first pregnancy I took me belly button ring out and it actually never closed up. On my second pregnancy, I never put my belly button ring back in but the hole is still open.
I had the belly button when i was pregnant i kept it till I was about 7 months but then its stretched so much I had strech marks around it so I removed it but once in a while I just put it in to keep it open so when I gave birth I wore it again and the strech marks didn't show as much with it :) Goodluck x
The extra long Flexi bars are a lot thinner than the normal bar and just prevent it closing over
Was shocked Bonds isn't a big thing in England ! Best baby , pajamas , bra and undies brand !
I took my piercing out with my first baby and it has scarred pretty badly. I'm 6 years on from having her and on my fourth pregnancy and there is still a hole there, it's not big enough to put a bar through but it's definitely there.
You look gorgeous! And so radiant and happy! And the nursery is so cute! :)
You can buy plastic stretchy pregnancy belly bars, they're long and they stretch with your body, then after baby you can pop your metal one back in.
Loving these videos ! So lovely seeing you happy xx
Awwww! You look so beautiful Fleur. Bless you and family.
Loving the bump updates!!! I think I've heard somewhere you ca get maternity belly bars, they're longer than normal bars so it can stay in through pregnancy
hi fleur, so so cute stuff for the baby! i have an idea, i'm also very organized, u may want to get large baby clothing storage furniture with many drawers and label the drawers in weeks 1-4 weeks and months 12-36 months, so that when you try on the clothes, if they don't fit and are  too large move the clothes down the storage drawers to the next weeks, months and years drawers, luv u and have fun!! melissa k. pa, usa
Took belly bar out around 24 weeks. The scanner said it got in her way haha. Im now 33 weeks and there is no way I would of kept a bar in haha. It's looking like it stretched and scarred as this point but won't know until I've had the baby. I would just take it out tbh. Looking gorgeous and just wait until u get bigger! Exhausting. I have bad pelvis pain and haven't worked since 28 weeks. Good luck x
Fleur, you look absolutely beautiful and stunning in the vlog. Please don't worry about you putting weight on! \nAlso I love love love the lipstick you have on, which on is it?
This vid will be nice to look back on. Happy for you!
I got to about 25 weeks and took my belly bar out and just put it back after the baby. Ps - ur bump is so diddy! U look amazing. Pregnancy really suits u! 😁
What lipstick are you wearing? It's gorgeous!
I cant believe how expensive this collection is,i mean its nice but nothing life changing
Why does it have to be SO EXPENSIVE 😭😭
The prices are rediculous
Could you try bare minerals please ❤️
So beautiful. I am in love with a lot of her make up. Wish I could treat myself. Will try to if I can get hold of some. Xx
Where are your earrings from?
Forever love your videos! Would LOVE to see you feature; NARS & Hourglass Xx
Thanks for the video, would love to see you do a Laura Geller video please :-) x
Please have my baby
I would love to see a video about Fenty Beauty.
Can I ask you to do the review of clarins makeup please?)
I didn't expect the bronzer to be as beautiful as it is! It looks so dull and light in the pan, but when you put it on your face, it was beautiful!
I think I'm going to grab the mascara. I am such a fan of any mascara that grabs all my lashes. In not sure of any of the other products. Thank you for being honest😘
For the one brand tutorial I would like to see a Natasha Denona one too if you can Nic 😘
No 7 video would be nice
Could you do a brand review on Hourglass? And Laura Mercier? Xx
Please bring the new blue brushes and the multi tech ones in Douglas stores in Germany...excited looking forward to get them from Douglas.de online Shop 🌸💕😘
that look is pretty
Wow, wow wow. The make-up your face and technical skills show the VB collection off to perfection. Thank you ❤️
I'd love for you to do a No7 Makeup tutorial/review! I don't see those very often and I think there are some decent thing within the brand for less bank breaking prices.
Lovely review, have you stopped using your lilash serum? Could you do update review on it x
It sounds weird but I love that greasy eyelid look. Do these transfer during the day?
I'd love to see a Clarins makeup tutorial!
I'd love to see a video using Tarte products! I try to use natural makeup brands when I can, and I think Tarte does that really well.

I can't deny that the packaging is beautiful, but the size of those eye shadows?  that's ridiculous.  They could have been a bit bigger to at least fill the compact.  I'm going to pass.  Although that eye foil looks great.  It looks like you're doing the glossy eye trend without the gloss.
Love Victoria Beckham's clothes, I was looking forward to seeing reviews on the cosmetics. Glad I waited because I am surprisingly not going to buy some of the items I originally had on my list! Love the Modern Mercury (I have the original one STILL), love the setting powder, and love the mascara! Thanks for the great review. Can't wait for the next ones!
Really love this type of video-very informative and helpful. Thanks Nic, brilliant job 😊
Loved the reviewtorial thought the end result was very much a Brooke Shields look. They do look like very luxurious products and you can see the quality in your results. Thanks for sharing
Could you do some more affordable brands like collection or maybelline x
Is flower beauty widely available there? It would be nice to see a brand review of that brand. Thanks! Still loved the end look even if you just wanted to try the products. :) great as usual.
Is this only colour of foil in the collection? Gorgeous makeup as always xx
If you can do Dior that would be great!! Thank you! Love love love your videos.
What show was she on. I recognise her just not sure what she was from??? X
You did a great job nic!
Could you try the new too faced kandee collection? \nWould be good to see an actual make up artist use it rather than just youtubers who dont have the same level of knowledge or experience xxx
Gorgeous!  I'd like to see beauty pie or kat von.d x
Nic, I think it would be hilarious to see you and Sam do a full face using homemade products based on jail makeup.  I love the vids where you guys  work together on a silly task like the waterproof mascara challenge you did.  \n\nI'm also dying to see you and Sam do looks from American Horror Story, especially Lady Gage's looks in the Hotel season.\n\nJust some ideas! Love to you all!!
Love the make up tutorial. Can you please do a review on Fenty beauty? I would an honest review. Thaaaanks x
besides makeup, you girl have a lovely nail color, i love it, show it often
Can you do a fenty makeup review
Will the real techniques powder bleu brushes come to ulta?
That lip liner color looks fucking good on you.
You're so adorable!!! I love your makeup tutorials!!
I really enjoy your videos....Could you review makeup revolution... thanks
Shit shit shit I really am trying to curb my spending on makeup. This doesn't help.
There's not a product that you used that doesn't look wonderful & flattering on you! I was wondering though, what color/brand did you use on your hair? I really like it
When is the defining crease brush out? Only shade set in the brushes info ☹️
Baby hairs- put hairspray on a toothbrush and comb through! :)
Stunning as always but the makeup looked a bit doll like for me...maybe it was the skin. I know a lot of people love the perfect look but I love to see your amazing skin a little more natural xx
I would like to see some older brands which aren't so mainstream but have stood the test of time! Elizabeth Arden, Guerlain, Givenchy! Don't tend so see these products in videos!
Why do you consider yourself lucky to interview VB?She is launching an exceedingly expensive makeup line. It's not as if she had you for tea.
Can you do a review of Anastasia Beverly Hills products ?
You should sell your brushes individually because there are Real Techniques brushes that I want to buy but don't get because they only come in sets that have brushes I'm not interested in. I'm not going to pay for an entire set when I only want one or two brushes. Just a thought!
62 pounds for translucent powder?! Which you are probably paying for the name instead of the quality, you would probably find the same if not better quality product at a drug store.
Review Chanel Makeup. I havent heard a lot from Chanel makeup products on youtube.
Please do a review on fenty beauty...
your skin is sooooooooooooooooo amazing!!! would you make a video telling us your skin care journey, PLEASEEE
Please could you or Sam do a Fenty Beauty video? :-*
Fab, honest review.  Really interesting.  Please don't do CT - I pass that every day on my walk into work.  I've spent enough there recently!!!
You are so pretty ❤️
✨❣️Awesome Review/Demo..👏🏻.. Love the Look You Created with VB..😍.. Would love to See you Review the Denessa Myricks range, She's created some Amazing products that are so versatile for every Skin Tone/Color!!❣️✨
Beautiful look Nic 😍 But the prices are ridiculous. No thanks 😁
Since your a very well known make up artist and interviewed VB I feel it's hard to be subjective. From other reviews I've seen this products are extremely overpriced. The products aren't bad but $60 dollars for a eye shadow quad where the pans are small and has two colors that don't go together at all. But I get it it's VB.
what i didnt know the pencil/kajal difference, thanks for teaching!
VB can do no wrong. Her collection of make up looks stunning. Maybe ideas for Christmas lists for people?
Can you do the new bare minerals barepro liquid foundation??
Once upon a time Victoria Beckham was putting her name to cheese and onion crisps. Now look at her collabs.. those prices!
Your skin is to die for!
I know it not fashionable but I would love to see a MAC review from their permanent line. You usually only see the LE collections.
The foundation blends perfectly in with your skin tone! It looks gorgeous! <3
Use a toothbrush with hairspray on to help with the wispy hairs it works really well with your parting when your hair is down too 😀
When you said you couldn't find the pencil, I immediately thought check to see if Edie has it! Lol!!  Did you ever find it?
Could you do Tarte please

...why do these celebrities think they are so above reasonable pricing?! absurd!!! please don't pay this for products when equally good or better products exist for less!! great review, nic and the look you created is stunning, as always....thanks for your down to earth honesty xoxo
Yes Fenty beauty please!! OMG VB products are expensive!! She may be pricing herself out of the market! Pass
I feel bad thinking this but I really wonder how you would've felt about these products had you not known they were vb?\nI've watched this channel for years and I respect you both a ton and such is the reason why I don't want to doubt you.
Can u review fenty beaity
Hi Nic....i Love ur Videos but these reviews would be even better when u could do a weartest and show how the Products lasted on  ur  face after  6-12 hours. Much love from Germany
Hi Nic and Sam! Would you consider doing a Fenty review? I'd love to hear your take on it.
Aronofsky makes weird as fuck movies all of which aren't as good as people say they are however I thought The Wrestler was fantastic and if he made more films like that I'd be a bigger fan of his... thank fuck that he didn't direct Wolverine. Mother was boring and too full of itself and was just plain mental but hey that's just my opinion.
it does have depth but the symbolism was far from subtle. Metaphors/symbolism were a tad obvious and the movie hits you over the head with its messages. Yeah it's different and unique but that doesn't automatically make it a masterpiece. It's being called pretentious because it is. The ending gets so out there I couldn't help but laugh at that moment. Still thought it was okay and a decent watch though lol. The 68% score on RottenTomatoes.com is pretty accurate.
Fuck you and your 30 second un-skippable add
Was gonna see this movie but since it's another mind fuck than a horror skip
This was an amazing wonderful beautiful film. The Story of Human.
Is it not a remake of Rosemary's baby?
This movie felt like Saving Private Ryan.... in a Home. \nAWESOMETACULAR
I'm only re watching this for 0:37.
people don't like j. Law because of her acting or recent appearances, it is because she has to give her political opinion every time she opens her mouth now.
This movie was so stupid. It was as if the director thought we were idiots. Like seriously audiences are smart and we don't need the metaphors to be so blatant and in our face. I hated it
Requium for a Dream is a highly overrated piece of shit and Black Swan was average at best... guess I'm a steer clear of this flick
I went to the theater and watch Mother! without reading the synopsis of the movie and I didn't understand what was happening but I was like oh shit what's going to happen next. Only after the movie than i read it online and than I started realizing what each scene meant and what the movie is really about. Really thought provoking movie seriously guys for those of you who haven't watched it please go ahead! I also want to add that JLaw's acting skills in this movie is the best I've ever seen honestly guys you won't regret it.
Seen it last night Jennifer Lawrence is The Virgin Mary, the husband is God then they have Jesus Hollywood puts there twist on it eat and kills Jesus he don t  even make it to the cross then Jennifer Lawrence burns the house up and the movie starts all over because the end of the world is next weekend. \n\nBut tbh I really enjoyed the movie, good scary movie if you're a Christian.
Hell No Mother movie I am not see it
I found the movie very interesting and I didn't think it was bad but I felt it would have been better if like 30 minutes of the film was cut from it. Warning to everyone who is going to watch it. This movie is long as fuck! Or maybe it's because you're so confused for the majority of it that it felt long. Either way, not a bad film
Jennifer get her boobs out.. That makes it a 10/10 from me.
So i gust it is call mother I gust it should be call mother fucker 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

I enjoyed the imagery, symbolism and allegorical depth of this movie but I did not connect with it emotionally at all. I think I just have a hard time connecting with characters that are not really people but instead allegorical cyphers. While interesting to watch it left me 100% emotionally cold.
Its the most vulgar movie ever.!!
Dawg I haven't let go of Jake Gyllenhaal not winning an Oscar for Nightcrawler either haha
How is it not a horror movie? It's _called_ Mother!\nAlso now I must see this movie.
Just saw it, and it was possibly the worst movie of the decade. No idea how JL, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfifer could sign onto this horrible movie. I know the weed nowadays is awesome...but did no one sober up to tell the director this plot sucks and we will help you write a different plot. Horrible...
People keep trying to make this movie seem super deep and complex. It's just a shitty movie. It's the most pretentious shit I have ever seen.
i thought these movie had something to do with Danzig.
Heard this movie wasn't good. So much Mystits blamed Trump for it and demanded a raise.
Jennifer Lawrence is a good actress for her age. Still a little immature to play some roles, but I don't see how she can get anyone aside from die hard fans of The Hunger Games to go and see her movies. She isn't that good looking, and that only matters in acting when starting a career. I don't see the appeal in her. Do people think she is a better actress than most girls her age? Some fan of hers, please post a link to a scene she has been in where it highlights her talent... and Hunger Games clips don't count. I fell asleep in the theater during the original.
she does suck she adds nothing to any movie
And out of respect for Darren Aronofsky I'm not gonna tell you what it is...because no one knows what it is.
I agree with the JLaw fatigue. She's a good actress but it's just like... SHE'S IN EVERYTHING. GOSH.
this movie is like oh i get whats going on, 2 seconds later what the fuck is going on?? seriously weirdest movie ever, great experience though
nightcrawler was fucking amazing ......... the world knows nothing!!
I came out the movie and I was like I need to see it again just to put eveything back in palce
This film was unique, I don't know if I hate it or I love it. I was gasping the entire time thinking what the fuck lol
This movie is end of evangelion confusing with its visual metaphors
Funnily enough, the trailer almost made me not go. A spoilerfree review (not this one, though) did.
You are one of the few people I see review this movie that actually sums up exactly what this movie is. Well done.\nExcellent movie. Don't expect it to be entertaining, but the message is powerful.
Based on how he reacted to 'Drive' all those years ago, I was pretty confident JJ would DESPISE 'mother!' Colour me very surprised
(I AM):\n\n(Gk. ego emimi);\n\n*(John 6:35)<---And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst).\n\n*(John 10:7)<---Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep).\n\n*(John 10:14)<---I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine).\n\n*(John 15:1)<---I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman).\n\n*(John 18:5)<---They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them).\n\n***Strong's #1473; 1510:\nThis expression denotes self-identity in self-sufficiency. In one breath, Jesus asserted His eternal preexistence and His absolute deity. Abraham, as with all mortals, came into existence at one point in time. The Son of God, unlike all mortals, never has a beginning. He is eternal; and He is God.\nThis is evident in Jesus use of the words I AM for Himself. This statement recalls the Septuagint (The Greek OT) translation of Exodus 3:6 & 14, in which God unveiled His identity as the I AM WHO I AM. Thus Jesus was claiming to be the ever-existing, self-existent God.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n(Jesus, The Great I AM!):\n\nJesus said unto them,\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\nBefore Abraham was, I AM.\n\nThen took they up stones to cast at him:\n\nbut Jesus hid himself, \nand went out of the temple,\ngoing through the midst of them, \nand so passed by.\n\n(John 8:58-59).\n\n***(I AM): Jesus was not just claiming to have lived before Abraham; He was claiming eternal existence. He was claiming to be, God Himself.\n\n***(Exodus 3:14)<---And (God) said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, (I AM) hath sent me unto you.\n\n***This time the Jewish leaders understood that Jesus was claiming to be God, so they took up stones to stone him for blasphemy. \n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n(Jesus claims equality with God in Power):\n\nThen answered Jesus \nand said unto them,\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\nThe Son can do nothing of himself, \n\nbut what he seeth the Father do:\nfor what things soever he doeth, \nthese also doeth the Son likewise.\n\n(The Son can do nothing of himself): Means that action by the Son apart from the Father is impossible because of the unity of the Father and the Son. (Whatever he does, the Son also does): Is a claim of deity and unity with the Father).\n\nFor the Father loveth the Son, \nand sheweth him all things \nthat himself doeth:\nand he will shew him \ngreater works than these, \nthat ye may marvel.\n\n(The son does what the Father does because the Father loves the son. Moreover, because the Father loves the Son, he reveals all to him. The Father would show the Son greater works than the healing of the sick man. Jesus would raised the dead and eventually judge humanity).\n\nFor as the Father raiseth up the dead, \nand quickeneth them; \neven so the Son quickeneth \nwhom he will.\n\n(The Son gives life): As God raises people from the dead and gives them life, so Christ gives people spiritual life. Jesus claimed the same power as God, thus claiming that he is equal with God).\n\n(John 5:19-21).
I like her nudes
Don't watch this movie
Nightcrawler should have won many awards.\nMother trailer was very 'Rosemary's Baby' to me, but after this review, I gotta go see it. \nAlso, Brigsby Bear with Mark Hamill. Have you seen it? Will you review it? I enjoyed it.
Wow. An insightful review from Jeremy Jahns that stands above his peers. Amazing.
The movie was a amazing experience I have t seen a movie that just mind f@u ked me so much
I don't give a fuck about Oscars really peter sellers didn't win for dr strangelove Goodfellas didn't win Oscar even Stanley Kubrick didn't win any damn thing !!!
When u go watch this movie please pay attention to detail!!!!! Keep an open mind also!!!! I feel like the people that didn't like the movie didn't really pay attention to detail .
Please contact me if you do not mind,Commit myself\nPSID   furyusai
Did Jeremy Jahns used to be 'Ask Ninja'? \n\nIt's been bugging me who he reminds me of and then it just hit.
Repent from sin, Jesus is Lord, crucified, buried, rose on the third day from the grave, turn to Him
Just call it a fucking allegory
even when Jennifer Lawrence is phoning it in she's better than half the actresses out there, which makes her super dope when she's actually putting in the extra effort. She's definitely worth buying on Blu-Ray
I said BULLSHIT aloud when this movies credits rolled. Worst film ive seen in a long time and I know film buffs will try and be like OHHH YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND. Nope. I understand. It's crap.
One of the most uncomfortable movies I've seen in a long while. The symbolism got a little heavy handed and lost a lot of the plot but overall still made for a very intense and thought provoking movie.
my favorite aronosky film is the fountain i love that movie.
Jake Gyllenhaal should've won that oscar man.....His performance in Nightcrawler was A-fucking-tastic.
This thing is bombing big time. I'm not sure why they would spend $15 million on Lawrence for an arthouse experiment that nobody will watch?  Or why Lawrence would expect a $15 million payday from a movie like this?  Actors typically take lower salaries for artsy experiments.
Jeremy my nigga. I been watching this nigga for years but this fucking confused me.
This is without a doubt one of the biggest expenses of ever had and I know the people are going to hate it and I know people are going to love it and I know that they're going to people be people who have no idea what to think of it but I'm just gonna go ahead and tell you I love this movie this movie is amazing when you figure it out is a brutal yes but listen please do not let something like that obscure but it is I'm baking you just please be open-minded when you go to see it but I promise you this movie is completely worth the watch just to see what you think
It's cinemascore is an F
I was actually interested in watching this movie but i completely lost any interest in it when you said that J. Lawrence was in it...
I went into this movie expecting the feature length film of the trailer\n\nHow dare I
My wife and I saw the movie yesterday to a near empty Saturday showing. I purposely didn't read explanations beforehand so that I could form my own opinion. I mistakenly thought it was going to be a Rosemary's Baby kind of plot.  The one heads up was hearing Lawrence say The house represents earth.\n\nAfterwards, both of us left the theater thinking it was a swing and a miss. Almost every shot of Lawrence was a tight shot that totally filled the screen with her face. The two most relevant segments of the movie seemed like never ending nightmares you couldn't wake up from. Not an experience you could call pleasurable or entertaining. \n\nCertainly the director had delusions of being Fellini but what you have is an embarrassing;y bad movie with a laughable last scene in which Lawrence is covered with fake looking make up meant to look like here charred remains. \n\nThe few people in the movie were checking their watches during the last 30 minutes. Maybe worth watching on Netflix.
The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, friends! \nHe loves you! Believe it! Don't listen to the lies of the enemy, Jesus Christ LOVES YOU! Repent and put your faith in Him! \n\nHe is not angry at you! He will help you with whatever you are going through. He is waiting on you to call out to Him. He will deliver you. \n\nI pray you make this moment you call upon Him, if you haven't already. He will save you from what is coming! Tomorrow is not promised to any of us! So please consider making Jesus Lord of your life today! \n\nShalom, friends.
Are u serious? Not every movie is for everyone .
Even after you know what this movie represents  it's  a terrible movie. It's  so ridiculously  loud, unorganized, and full of itself.
I haven't seen it but I'm guessing it has a bunch of feminazi ,anti-American propaganda anti-Capitalism, and anti-fame worshipping propaganda in it. Which is hypocritical because it stars really famous actors who love being in the spotlight. Notably Jennifer Lawrence. What a douchbag! Maybe Darren's directing saves it.
My problem with jennifer lawrence is that studios blatantly try to sell her and shove our faces with more and more forced jlaw everytime. Like it's so obvious that some research found that jlaw sells movies to the average consumer so let's just have her in everything. I mean she is talented but since she's in 30 movies per year i just see her as miss. Actress woman in every role. She's not even likeable either, lol. I guess she screwed up when she used an important rock in hawaii to scratch her butt, whatever, but last year she made fun of a latin reporter literally trying to translate his notes? No thanks. She's just an ignorant kid who got real famous real fast and since studios are trying to exploit her as much as possible I'll just skip her movies.
This movie is completely metaphorical, I don't just mean there are metaphors in the movie... I mean the movie itself is not the movie itself 😐................................................ 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I saw mother! and I did not like it at first but now I kinda dig it.
Mother! is one of the best movies of the year. @3:37... A Ghost Story.
This movie was shit, yiu suck at reviewing movies man
I personally thought the ending half with all the people was horrific. I'd call it a horror movie from that alone
This movie is a movie you need to smoke before watching. My mind was more open and I felt like I understood the underlying meanings that I wouldn't catch sober. Usually why I enjoy smoking before a complex movie.
seen it last night.. got me confused.. I couldnt wait to see it but after I did I kinda regret it..what a waste..
this incoherent babbling  just wasted time i'll never get back.
I actually liked this review. Yes, you don't get to know anything about it - and that is a bonus for me - but it also tells you what it's not, and that makes me curious to see what it is. See what I'll get out of it and than maybe watch the spoiler review later to see what he got out of it.\n\nAnd hate her or love her, but Jennifer Lawrence is a great actor. When she goes for it, she's incredible and she deseves the Oscars she got. Just had to say that cause it's seems to be cool to hate on her these days.
I got tired of being confused so i left before the end.  too many confusions with not enough explanations.  I feel like I've lost both my money and my time.  Fairly great acting, but to me both the writer(s) and director of this movie must've been high before and after making this movie decision.
I gave this comment a like because it's acknowledging that I gave it a like and that's meta
Disturbing and unsettling.
Still salty jake didn't get nominated
Brendon Eurie Lookin ass
Awful artsy trash.
Plz review GLOW
Movie is shit
booiiiiiii hell na
Review Logan Lucky next
What a horrible review
So existential sounding.  Drrrp
Nightcrawler was amazing
Review American Vandal!! 😁😁
https://youtu.be/uJDO1DcPWXc
Fucker
Satanism in Hollywood intensifies
YES! Nightcrawler deserved a nomination
This movies was blasphemous, anyone can see that the entire plot is about how God is evil and the baby eating part was a perversion of the eucharist. You wont see anyone making something like this about Islam.
I dont get why some people would dislike it because it was mismarketed\nThats so retarded, the film is objectively good no matter what genres you normally lean toward
Oh wow\nThis is going to be great movie\nI am going to watch it
You have to be a film major to understand what you are saying.  Luckily, I was a film major.  Will anyone else understand this?  I do not know!  Thumbs down on the movie.  Watch my vague review in laymans terms on youtube.
This movie is atrocious. It tried to be this highly intellectual poetic artistic whatever bullshit it wanted to be. Youtubers should learn from the amazing clickbait ability of this movie. \n\nAnd all you critics are praising the sh*t out of this cause you might get labeled as too stupid to undestand a movie that is way ahead of its time if you admit to finding it terrible. Art is abstract, ain't it?\n\nGod, you'd really see how film critics are a bunch of pretentious snobs acting high and mighty for giving this sh*tfest a 69% on rotten tomatoes.
Why is this idiot trending, when Chris Stuckmann has put out a much better review?
Do Australians just have iron butts? Well... yes.
You should have wiped your butt with those bed sheets.. thatll make a statement and hopefully the hotel owner takes the hint and improves the quality of the toilet paper :)
I think there's a GMM episode in which they determine the best toilet paper. If that helps you shopping ^^
I saw you at VidCon Australia
It's not your butt cheeks it's your inter gluteal cleft... I learned that from crash course... I'm like 90% sure that's where I learned it from... but I may be wrong.
Reminds me of that old game, toilet tycoon simulator. In this game you operate a commercial restroom and people pay you money to go take a dump basically. As you earn money you can upgrade different elements of your toilets like the bowl and the paper. You start with regular toilet paper, then you get the extra fluffy stuff and at some point people are wiping their bums with silk. I remember the highest toilet paper level is Minx Fur. \n\nI'm not making this up, this is a real game.
Buy a portable bidet! Problem solved. This is the one I got. Works really well:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Brondell-GS-70-GoSpa-Travel-Bidet/dp/B008CSDKSQ/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1505791651&sr=8-4&keywords=portable+bidet
Dear Hank, \nI was very sad when I found out that your show in Portland sold out while I was at work. This video made me happy again. Thanks for sharing your amazingly awesome weirdness with all of us. I'll miss seeing you in Portland.
Hank...... This video was a lotta fun
Oh these are your butt cheeks\nYour gluteus what cheeks?\nGet some A+D ointment\nAnd make an appointment\nAnd end irritation\nAs you strut cheeks\n\nYour butt cheeks\nThese hands are your butt cheeks\nThe motion I'm makin'\nIs a simulation\nOf the action\nOf both of your butt cheeks\n\nThese are your butt cheeks\n\n\nYou're welcome, internet.
Hank, I missed your weird side. \nI work in a hospital where people get treated for butt problems, and I sometimes have butt problems. The toilet paper is HORRIBLE. Coincidence? Perhaps. OR guaranteeing more business.
That Rap... is going to be the next top single of 2017
I have three words for you, Hank... Flushable. Wet. Wipes. Not only cleans your butt much better, but is way more comfortable. I'm a complete convert.
This was an incredible viewing experience. 😂
Okay Hank, what drugs did you take? Can you take more because this was hilarious.
I'm sorry, was that the crow soundbite from The Simpsons?
This is a lot.  I am happy about this.
God that was excellent
sorry about ur butt :(
WTF did i just watch, lol
His outback hates their outback
Baby wipes, flushable. Use small peice of TP as a small base, one sheet of baby wipe...
I have a bidet on my toilet and will never go back to not having one. But, when traveling I always carry wipes.
What was that Hank???
Do a video about Brexit please...
this feels like old vlogbrothers I love it
Thank you for your honesty and candor about this subject. I have gastro issues and this is the truest thing ever.
I don't know why it took me two days to get to watching this masterpiece. I'm crying from laughing.
Boudreaux's butt paste is my fav cream. It kind of smells like cookie dough, too (smell BEFORE application).
It's Charmin. And yes you should bring it with you everywhere apparently :P
This is why I use wet wipes. Wish they weren't terrible for the sewers though.
Yeah I know what you are talking about I live in Australia and the toilet paper in schools is so bad ,like the only place you can find good paper is if you buy it yourself.
Peri bottle. Or travel bidet. That's what you need, Hank.
And I JUST watched Vox's video about triplets in rap and then Hank drops that madness.
i mean, the population of lgbtiq people in australia are going through a political situation that is incredibly dangerous to our mental and physical health - speaking, of course, about the nation-wide survey to determine whether we are seen as humans in the eyes of the greater population - but, sure, talk about toilet paper. Whatever.

I wasn't emotionally prepared for this... Why did I wait until Monday morning...
I am Australian and generally assume that any public toilet including hotels will have single ply crepe paper for toilet paper. I lived in halls of residence and found it very handy to have your own decent toilet paper supply. It's just expected that public toilet paper is bad toilet paper. So yeah. This also applies to hotels. A nice hotel is not defined by its rooms or its price. It's defined by whether or not it will fork out for decent and also a DECENT AMOUNT of toilet paper. 2 rolls is not enough for a weeks accomodation I'm telling you!
1. 🙋🏼 Butt problems! \n2. I really want a full version of This is Your Butt Cheeks... Like, seriously. It's stuck in my head and I'm not even mad. \n3. This is probably my favorite vlogbrothers video in a long time.
Just realized that John has the same type of front teeth in the lower Jaw that I have xD
Hey Hank! In Britain supermarkets DO give you the per yard cost of toilet paper (actually, I think it's per sheet). It's written in little numbers under the price label. They do this for nearly everything, not just toilet paper: they tell you how much your raspberries cost per gram, and how much your orange juice costs per ml. It's great and so useful.
I know for a fact that you spent way too long on that rap. well done hank. well done
Are we going to have a 2017 nerdfighteria census? I don't want to come off like I'm pressuring you, Hank. I get that you're super busy. I've just been hoping for a while that you would release one because I like taking them. They're fun. Again, no pressure.
Goodness!
Think I know true cause of your problem...... Cheap food IN must eventually OUT.
Hank is a wonderful human being.
I swear, Australia has good toilet paper available! This hotel is letting us down.
A couple of weeks of bad toilet paper once gave me months of pain and bleeding and PANTS AREA UNPLEASANTNESS. I feel so much less alone in the world now. #buttproblems
been a while since we've had a Hank song like that ...
You realise that the next time you come to Australia, everyone you see will have rolls of our softest bog roll/dunny paper/pottypaper, just for you.
As someone who lives in Melbourne I can confirm that pretty much nowhere has nice toilet paper. Not restaurants, not hotels, not anywhere. It's a bad time.
VlogBrothers /Hank,,\nI too feel your pain. Don't let the name fool ya, Charmin Ultra Strong is the way to go. Worth every penny. Because A man has to do what a man has to DOO and you shouldn't be dreading the before or after. 😯\nHere's hoping everything comes out alright. \nok, I've gotta go ,give it a try. You won't be disappointed. BTW, you can prevent splashdown and significantly cut down on the ode de doo aroma with a product called \nV.I.Poo.\nI WISH I was making this $#!+ up..\nlmao
Buy a bidet!!! It attaches to your existing toilet, hooks into the water and only costs around $150 for most of the bells and whistles (slow close lid, heated seat, front and back wash, adjustable temp and pressure, and even more butt related things). It is the second best thing you can do for your bathroom. First best thing? Squatty-potty. It is the truth.
Hank needs to do more videos like this 😄
Hank, other than your butt are you ok man?
Just thinking about all the nerdfighters that are going to have this as their first video introduction.
there is one thing I absolutely can't stand is Australian accents!!!!!!!!!!
2:23-2:41 what did I just watch
Need to hop on the diss track trend
*Raises Hand* I have butt problems.
Erm ... are you OK, hank? ;-)
Oh Hank, I feel your pain. I'm Aussie, and I have butt problems - I could recommend you the good toilet paper if you ever come back. I just spent a week on a cruise ship with the second worst toilet paper I've ever had the displeasure to use. Like seriously P&O, I would be happy to pay an extra $10 to have good toilet paper - maybe you could make that an option when booking one's ticket.
Maybe people thought the nice toilet paper was complimentary, so they took it all.\nAnd the hotel was like; we're going to take a square from our friends over at Wal-Mart
It's me when I haven't slept enough lol
i have Noassatall.  That's a butt problem, right?
This is very interesting to me because I (a Brit) was recently in America and EVERY SINGLE ROLL I came across in my three months there were all single ply, even in people's houses. Now I'm in Canada and have never been more grateful for that extra ply, whatever the heck a ply is.
What am I watching? The butt cheeks song... that was random
Ok so as an American who just started a semester exchange in Melbourne I have an actual answer for you. There is an initiative in the city to use biodegradable toilet paper to preserve the environments of their endangered species that are unique to the region. Half of the Melbourne Zoo exhibits have info about toilet paper https://www.zoo.org.au/get-involved/act-for-wildlife/wipe-for-wildlife
This was the funniest video I've seen in a long time. Thanks for making me laugh out loud jet lagged Hank!
My daughter has these issues as well. We have figured out a way for her to be comfortable regardless of where we are. We carry a bag specifically called the potty purse. In it is her preferred toilet paper along with san-wipes to clean the toilet if it is dirty, personal cleansing wipes for her comfort, hand soap in case there is none available, paper towels and hand sanitizer. We travel a lot so it became important for us to figure out a way that was uniform for her to be comfortable. We never leave the house without the potty purse!
Well....I know what nerdfighter joke shirt I'm wearing for the Tuataria collab!!! Can you guess?!?!?!
I just discovered this, and despite the very *very* strange topics going on in here, this makes me the happiest person ever.
this video was absolutely amazing.
Hank, please never break into song ever again
Pls release a full version of the buttcheek song\nthx
butt seriously, when's the single dropping?
This was so immensely relatable to me. I have butt problems stemming from a digestive disorder and it's miserable! Yeah, painful to even walk which makes my depression even worse because walking is typically how I deal with pain.
You gonna apologize for vid con yet or what?
Wash your ass with water.
So let me be clear with my question Hank.... You used to be a Maintenance Associate at Walmart? Because that's my job at the moment, cleaning the facilities and everything else all together. It's not a pleasant job, yet it will do.... (as long as my sanity allows it)
Jet-lag Hank is the best Hank 👏
*Go watch The Greatest Story Never Told if you want to know the truth.*
Only a few things are meant to be trending, this is one of them
I'm making this into a meme 4 hours and it will be up
Use water, guys. It's the best. A bidet or a small hand shower thingy.
I had heard of people bringing their own toilet paper when they travel and I guess this is why.  TIL that TP is one of the things that 'MURICA does really really well, along with air conditioning and big fist-sized ice cubes.
definitey the weirdest hank video ive seen in a while
Is this a hemorrhoid issue ?  You know you can go to Walmart and pick up some Fiber Con that will solve the problem you will see results in a week I saw results in 3 days big difference now I don't have the problem at all . It comes in a little bottle you'll find it in the pharmacy area it works
Use your hands Hank. 😂
Butt problems make Hank angry.

Henry,
Yay uraverageconsumer
I phone sucks.
Nice, more ishits for isheeps/idiots!
lol
Apple Geniuses put retards to shame
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh Jonathan is adorable
Hello Justine! Wish you the best luck forward !!
hes going on a excursion in german vehicle on tv.. its not 'real'
Glad you like it! I love the new iPhone too! I even rapped about it on my videos lol
I love how excited she is 😭
Justine your enthusiasm is absolutely contagious and hype and I love it! I'm so excited for you and for the new products of course ❤️ Love from an Apple Employee
Well im sorry to say this but nade chose the wrong sister
If you want the best and greatest phone is the Samsung 8
Congrats on getting to go to the keynote and congrats on 4 million!!!!
Only 3gb RAM when iOS11 is catered only to 64-bit apps will be the X's greatest weakness in the long run. Should've been 4gb. The iPhone 5s is already showing its age with iOS11 with just 1gb.\n\nMoroccan blue LG V30 for me or forget another cookie cutter smartphone altogether. Too quick to die on us, 2-3 yrs tops. Better get a Nintendo Switch with the Mario Odyssey bundle instead. My Jordan 7 retros lasted longer than my smartphones. 5 yrs > 2-3 yrs.\n\n#fuckplannedobsolescence
are you going to be lining up for the iphone 8
Apple is excellent in reliability but BEWARE:  IPhone X uses infrared *LED Lasers* to Scan your face. This laser scan is Unhealthy and leads to *Skin Diseases* (which most already know, starts with a *C* )
5:42 oH YES I HEAR THE BEATLES
What happened to the iPhone 9??
I mean it looks clean and smooth and nice but.... the camera.. come on like it looks weird... and NO BUTTON!!! I mean WHEN I SEE A ROUND BUTTON I THINK OF APPLE! Apple is known for having that button..
What garbage, it's like she is brainwashed by Apple
What happened to iPhone 9? #what happened to iPhone 9 #iPhone 9
android still better lmao

good job apple keep it up....
Yeah,it changed your life.You life is dependent on it,you don't have friends.
Rly 1000$ ? The iPhone Xpensive already arrives and for sure everybody is hyped. Sry for that price even as Apple proponent that's not ok!!!
An expensive and sad obsession, stop promoting this over priced bullshit please.
The problem is : where is iphone 9 ???
I'm so happy that you got to go!! I was smiling throughout the whole video <3 Steve Jobs is one of the few people i idolize as well so you meeting his partner in crime, Waz, is pretty amazing, girl! <3
Your best video to date
Apple Park is the big theater. You review very great! Amazing...
OMG! I can feel your joy for being there. I wish I could be there too.
Still rocking my iPhone 4s and proud
Dont press read more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour completly savage
Congratulations Justine! ❤️😊
Great job!!
Beautiful AF!

Holy spoiled girl!!! Talk about white privilege.
Hi ijustine plz donate iphone x me
7:30 What The...
Zoey 101 got the first iphone
I’m so thankful for you, iJustine. Apple holds such a huge place in my heart and I love everything they are. Thank you for being such an amazing YouTuber and letting people like me live through your videos.
I can be your friend 😉
A pack of cards with the apple logo on it...OMG THIS IS SO COOL 😂😂
Cool vlog ! You are so so Beautiful and Charming!!!!
The theatre is cool but everything about the phone seems like a gimmick.
I want to marry you justine 😍😍😍 :D
Your exuberance in this film is fantastic. So glad you got to go.
What song is that?
I love your videos, because you doing them full of euphoric. :))
$340 dollar watch band. Outta your mind.
Just subscribed! Love your videos!!
Justine is so pretty!!
X: Roman numeral for 10
so i see a girl by justine friend next to him that girl like wtf is she doing
This girl is getting really fat after she has a kid.
Does the iPhone X have depth effect for the back facing camera
I like you so much do she have a husband or boyfriend
I loved the video. So much definition. So many colors, Such a good and bright day. Wonderful just wonderful.
These people taking photo's of the new iPhone with an iPhone they paid hundreds of dollars for less than 1yr ago, the level retardation with these halfwits is unbelievable. The comment section is littered with the most brain dead consumers of Apple products, all trying to justify stupid and pointless purchasing of absolute trash.
Super nice building. How were they able to build it? Because morons keep buying things that were out on other phones years ago, and paying Apple a premium for them. Suckers...
Boy wonder what Steve-o would say about the X........
they got all money dont pay that much tax they put up the price for iphones  just crazy really
Really enjoyed the video.
a tour? it's the same thing all around
Ijustine, Please do not promote Iphone X anymore. It is a scam. Super retina? It is made from samsung thank you!! Face ID? Samsung 8 has it and you know what? It has fingerprint scanner too!! Animated emoji? Snapchat thank you!! More? It costs 1000USD!! Holy shit!! People, please listen, Apple is just taking advantage of you. I think is time to let them know it is not okay.
omg like if get i that i am not gonna take the bus anymore
she hasn't aged in 10 years?!
Don't bother to review iphone x or whatever until you answer this question:  Who designed this product?
just pre ordered the iPhone 8 plus!! couldn't get myself to spend the thousand dollars on the iPhone X.
why should we care about your day with Apple and that joke of a phone?
How much is that apple park shirt? I want one. 😭
$20 for how many postcards? I've been to the Apple HQ Store, and they have outrageously priced trinkets. Stuff no one would use. But this looks like they have more stuff. Cards are a must. That Apple Park shirt was legit. And I thought you would get that Fuchsia hermes watch band?
Apple won't change people's life anymore
Hey Justine, you look great as always... just wanted to say: In Canada, starting at $1319 !!! That is just CRAZY!!! I just booked a 7 day all inclusive trip to Cancun Mexico, flights, accommodations, all you can eat and drink for a week for $1200 Canadian. Apple will never see my money in their bank account. I am beyond happy with my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.
I like your videos. You seem like a very fun person. I used to live 5 blocks from there as a kid. I think that was a plum or walnut orchard then. My Dad thought he did good buying our house for $22,000 and selling it in '67 for $28,000. Now it's valued at $1.3 M. HAHA
That building look like an ovni i saw long time ago!
THE LITTLE KID i died
I justine* you so beautiful😍
What song is that at around 7 minutes?
How many decks of cards did you buy, sell me one?
What is that song playing throughout the video in places and then again at the end of the video? it's really cool I can't wait for the AppleTV 4K, myself.
I still think the Design sucks. That notch just looks out of place. Imagine when the phone is in landscape mode...... I know apple fanatics will still defend it.
1:06 what movie is that??
it would be awesome if there was a purple (galaxy colored) iphonee
Wow you are practically having an orgasm over a phone #sad
T E C H N O L O G Y
How much do you like I phones
Smash!!
I bet she has a 99 year old boyfriend sugar daddy that is missing just 1% for his final update, and then his soul will install itself in her bank account.
Wow! Very innovative Apple, copying from a already existing phone, the Samsung S8 AND the Google Pixel, verrrrry innovative! (Waiting for all the butthurt people with a Apple fetish...)
Justine is aging like goat milk.
YOU HAVE OLD LOOKING HANDS AND YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING WITH THAT THIN HAIR YOU TRY TO ACT LIKE YOU ARE YOUNG SMH
Six and the City 👍
5-0 4-0 6-0 ... RIP Palace next week
Aguero golden boot>>>>>
easy
Pep is a fraud. Spent £1 billion and can't score 10 goals against Watford
Crystal Palace next LOL!
im the best thanks for the upload, beany!
You city fans should appreciate every day this guy is your manager. Coming from a Bayern Munich fan. After he leaves you will miss this astonishing performances believe me. No matter who comes next
*Where's all the City haters saying Pep is a fraud now? That was an absolute slaughter & so was Liv'pool 5-0. As a Chelsea supporter I fear City this season.*
EPL welcome to total football, watch and enjoy, just starting #takenoprisoners
best manager in the world okay city come on pep come on city...
*_Great win for City_*
Pep bringing la liga scorelines to the epl
again not good enough #pepout #Cityincrisis
I'm a city fan but let's not get carried away. Let's not trash talk or be cocky yet. Injuries and complacency can happen at any time. Plus we got chelsea at the end of this month and still yet to play top 6 sides.\n\nI really hope we defend against the top sides and not commit the fullbacks too much forward against them.
aguero  fanstastic
C'MON CITY
Heavy breather
!´m so so happy!
Take note all you bitch ass City haters, we're on a man hunt and hungrier than ever !!!
The pep haters are low in numbers on the comment section. I wonder why!
Best bald manager in the world.😁😂😂
Why are people not commenting fraud
Looking real good for Guardiola...Jesus has forced Aguero to step up his work rate and now Aguero has the ability to become golden boot
WHERE ARE ALL THE PEPS A FRAUD TROLL'S NOW. YOU ARE NOT, YOU'RE NOT REALLY HERE JEALOUSY IS A SILENT M*THER F#CKER INNIT .GORD CTID. OOWHHH MAN CITY.....THE ONLY FOOTBALL TEAM TO COME FROM MANCHESTER®
Big sigh, wish he was at Arsenal!
Are United still the favorites???!???!?? 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 Top of the league from here on out
How awesome was that performance? That was total and complete football...\nIf only PEP wasn't a fraud? We'd be even better, if Pep was a decent manager.... But apparently he's a fraud according to some football geniuses.
IN PEP WE TRUST 100%
Pep haters not swarming the comments on every video I see lol if he wins the league with City so many ppl gonna cry
Your still not gonna win anything this year you glory hunting tossers.
If pep was argentinian, cant imagine what messi-aguero partnership will be like. Argentina would probably be 4 times WC champion by now
I think its between City and United who wins the pl title this season, I hope Kompany stays healthy for the rest of the season, because defensively city is still vulnerable, maybe Pep can bring a new CB in january.
Every PL fan: In the PL any club could win you'll never see a 6-0 score line in the PL .... where you guys at now? Hmm now that an English club finally has a talented club worthy to compete in Europe they're thrashing pub clubs like watford.
I guess 6-0 is what it takes to get Pep to smile
best manager in the world
City and Utd show-down this season
Man city means everything to me and the fans ...personaly I better miss a meal than missing a man city match.... Love you citizens'
Meanwhile, Manure are celebrating being behind their city rivals PMSL
even we didn't play our best xl so don't take it easy united dogs
GGMU GGMU 
no matter wat city do pipo will always talk shit so to all the city n gaurdiola haters go fuck yrselves or rather go masterbate
City city city all the way
I am so happy.. Happy new year
Pep gloats by bigging up his opposition to make him sound better
Thank you CITY!
Man city vs Chelsea \n4-2\nMan City  vs CP \n10-0

this is on trending lads

Bald fraud
Money talks
MCFC!
beautiful
Guardiola the team that played the last 20 minutes is  amazimg use them offten. And we fans Will watch beutifull football.
BEST FRAUD IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!
I'am Man.United fan but i admitted the football from City just amazing to watch.\nAttacking Football that he brings to City simply magnificent.\nAs a lover of attacking football i admire his philosophy.
Don't let this romp fool you ,Citeh will collapse either midseason or late season like they always do.
Damn it feels good to be a gangster
When Real and Barcelona win 6-0 English fans ARE TOLD BY THE ENGLISH MEDIA that the Primera is an easy league and the Premier League is the tough League where the big teams die to win!! when City win 5-0 against Liverpool and 6-0 against Watford what happens to the tough Premier League?!! WAKE UP ENGLISH FANS....ITS ALL PART OF MARKETING...
My Top Six Prediction :\n1.Manchester City\n2.Manchester Utd\n3.Chelsea\n4.Liverpool/Tottenham \n\n\nOpinions?
City were playing this style under mancini and pellegrini, nothings really different
Can not say he is the best till he bring city the champ of epl...
Faggot
fraud! city will bottle it towards the end of the season
Oh wow Helen these photos are the culmination of the work we've seen you put in throughout the vlogs in the lead up to the wedding and I have to so you absolutely outdid yourself. I don't think I've ever been so impressed by a wedding! Absolutely love your theme and your flower arrangements and pops of colour were just to die for and it looks like everyone had such an amazing time. Thank you so much for sharing, much love 💜 xx
I actually lol'd at matthew talking about his neck roll 😂😂 oh please get rid of it \n\nBeautiful photos 😭❤
I'm a photographer so seeing this and hearing your opinions on the images is so inspiring. Loved the photos and the decorations and everything 💛💛💛
Thank you guys for sharing your special day with all of us! It looks like it was a magical day. 💖💖💖
My pyjama bottoms are being eating by my arse 😂😂😂😂 so funny. Gorgeous photos 😍😍
Theres just SOO many little fine details in your wedding that made it so lovely
What was your first dance song?
It's nice to see the end result after watching all your planning in your vlogs! It looks like you both had a very special and magical day! Xx
Your wedding photos are all so lovely! Looked like it was an amazing day 😍
Crying at 'reverse neck'.
Beautiful!! I'm getting married in 3 weeks! I'm super nervous and stressed about it 😅. But, seeing you two looking back at your magical day gives me the happy feels! Congrats you two! 💕💕💕 you're an inspiration!
They're beautiful!!  The photos of Maff and his friends look like they could be Mumford and Sons and I love it!!
*there's no funny comments to look at.*
Lovely 😊 \nPs. I fancy Connor so hard! He is my young Kurt Cobain! 💔
Most epic wedding of all fucking time
So beautiful! I love how colorful it was without being tacky at all! People are often so scared of color but you did it Right! GORG!!
SUCH A GOOD PHOTOGRAPHER
I got engaged yesterday so instead of watching all of your adorable wedding videos and dreaming of the day, I get to plan one too!  Can't wait to film all the fun vids for it.  Your wedding looked like a magical carnival dream! 🍿 🍾  🎡
Helen, seems like I'm close to the first to comment on your video, thought i'd take the chance to tell you how much I love all of your videos! Thinking you might definitely see this comment... But just want to make sure you know how great you are, and how down to earth, genuine and lovely, and how much I always look forward to watching your videos! Love how you switch things up now and then and try different things! You're not scared to do you or take risks with fashion makeup or your video styles! You are like my dream best friend that I've never met. Keep doing what you're doing, you're beautiful! Lots of love!  Xxx
Thanks for sharing, what great memories to have.
As an outdoorsy sort of bloke, I have to say that your wedding day looked superb. That great hall looked excellent. Lookslike you all had a great day.\nCongratulations
What a perfect set up! Loved everything about your wedding 😚
Ahh i love Chloe! She is ace, she second shoots for me sometimes and when i heard she was shooting at ur wedding i was like omg! So cool. I watch your videos religiously haha never comment but always watch. Had to comment on this as i love the photos! Emily and chloe did an awesome job and your wedding looked so amazing! Congrats! X
this was absolutely great! thank you for sharing. perfect commentary. very proud to see you growing into such an incredible person; have subbed since the beginning og helen------
Barney in the conservatory with the candlestick hahah my first thought when I heard you say Barney in the conservatory 🤣🤣
Such a nice idea to talk us all through the pictures! Thank you for sharing :}\n(I like this so much more than the movie)
Number 28 on trending yeyyyyy!!!!! Love them so much x x x
I kept thinking she said butt holes lol, but Helen you looked stunning and those photos were everything ❤️️❤️️❤️️❤️️
these are stunning, so happy to see you had such a lovely day  <3
I love how different your wedding was. It was so stripped back and simple in a way. More about the fact you were getting married than all this flouncy shit some weddings have. The photos are gorgeous ❤️
I don't even know why the picture of Lola at the wedding got me so nostalgic but it really did! I just remember you getting Lola when your life was so different and I realised I've watched your life completely change! It's been such a pleasure to see you sort of 'grow up' in a way! Thank you so much for sharing your life with us, you will forever be my favourite YouTuber! Beautiful wedding and lovely video as always. Lots of love!xxx
why am I crying watching this, really moving Helen, have been watching you for years and so happy for you both xx
So so happy for the two of you!!   Looked like you had the best day ever and will be having the best life together that two people could possibly come by!!!
fab!! i love this and both xo
Your wedding looked amazing! I hope all of the photos helped bring the day back in to focus for you. ❤️ I just wanted to say I really love the way you took the carnival wedding theme, which has become rather trendy, and made it completely your own. From the video to all the photos I can see that your personalities and styles shine through in all the details.
Helen who did your veil??? So fab!
Oh its all so rainbow and lollipops i love it!
Love these pics. I'm having a barn wedding next summer - thanks for all the inspiration! 👍🏻
Lovely photos! \nAlso would love a tutorial on your eyemakeup in this video 😍😍
What an unbelievably lovely video, and I'm not even halfway through. Thanks so so much for sharing, it was like seeing the pictures of a friends wedding 💕
Wow! That was awesome, I think I smiled for 18mins straight, congratulations.
Been waiting SOOO long for this one 🎈💓💫🕶
Watching this makes me so happy, the pictures are all so lovely and the wedding looks so unique and fun! Congratulations <3
I LOVE your purple veil omg! if 8 ever get married I would easily do a purple veil!
If I was getting married again I'd defo do it like yours.
Seeing the stuff as you were buying it, I thought I would be a bit hodgepodgey. It's turned out beautifully!
This looked like the most incredible wedding. Glad you had a lovely time ❤
This video made me so happy
My heart is 😭 crying with so much love ❤️ \n Must say that the weeding has a lot of things that I in a daily basis I don't like, Such as sunflowers and farm things, and you manage to pull over one of the best weddings I ever seen. Fantastic job you two!!!
I love how creative your wedding was. So nice to see something differnt  🖒🖒
your wedding was just gorgeous....ugh. It was so you! Seems like it was a great day; love from Boston USA!
Your wedding looks beautiful ❤️\nThis has literally given me inspiration for my own wedding xx
I'd love to watch some more arts and crafts you do Helen I find it fascinating xxx
Looks like the funnest wedding ever
You can so see you and Maff's personalities in these photos, so much character! I love it❤️ Don't know if you've answered this before but what was your first dance song? Would love a little insight into the music you chose! Hope you're still loving being newlyweds! X
Thanks for sharing Helen and Maff xx Helen you always make me want to chew gum 😂
I just love the amount of colour and character in every picture! These have so much personality compared to most wedding pictures :)
I've followed you since god knows how long from a young teenager to an adult today , I feel like I've grown as a person with you ❤ You're amazing . Again , congratulations , may you two live happily ever after ❤❤
That location!!! And all of the decorations and activities, seriously amazing! 💜
The photos are so beautiful!!!!!! Love you loads!!! Also the outro is so cool xD
I Love Your Wedding Photos😍
God that looks so fun! Thank you for sharing :)
Those are SO GOOD ❤
You guys are so cute 💗 love the photos, everything looked so unique and colourful!
I love all the details you had!! That photo booth is amazing and then all your food vans. Amazing. Venue looks gorgeous
Aww Maff looks tired, well done for working so hard all the time. :) Lovely photos Helen, so great to see the wedding after all the preparation!!
You look so beautiful and all the candid photos are so nice!
You and Matthew are beautiful !!!
Awww I smiled all the way through 💕
Deja vu- isn't this the video from yesterday?
This is so lovely, thankyou for sharing it. Out of curiosity what was your first dance song? Totally cool if you don't want to share btw as it is obviously very personal :)
some very nice photos there :)
This is so so sweet <3 Loved that photo where you're smiling at each other right before the ceremony!!
Excited to watch this 💕
The bridesmaids dresses went to we'll with all the colours! I remember you getting lots of unnecessary criticism about your choice of colour combinations for the dresses, but your vision really came true as far as one can see in the photos! :D
I loved this! Felt like I was a close friend being shown all of your lovely wedding pics 😁 This just goes to show how important getting the right photographer for your wedding day is. So many people want to scrimp and save on the photographer and don't realise the dedication and effort that goes into getting the perfect shots for your big day. My brother got a cheap wedding photographer and ended up having no pictures with my mum in! So it's always worth spending that bit extra - you'll be looking back on those pictures for the rest of your lives :)
your husband is so beautiful
Helen your dress was STUNNING. Where was it from?
Beautiful pictures! Congratulations xxxx
S
How cute !!!!
mazal tov
Aww this is really lovely <3
Best wedding ever
❤️❤️❤️ this
Sooooo beautiful!!!
Gorg! Congrats again! 💞💞
Such beautiful  pictures  nice job
Most beautiful wedding😍
Loved this
Awwww!!!💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
💜awesome
Helen! You're trending!
Haven't I see this already?
Cute couple. You guys kinda look like siblings to me
How did the family politics work out after? I saw your mum and dad in the same room when you were getting ready!
Cutting the the cake was the most awkward pointless part of our wedding. Looking back we wouldn't have done that, you didn't miss anything lol
Hipster cringe!!! #obvious
He looks so happy 😑😂
Such a cute videoooo Xx
Natural hair, short hair, long hair, dyed hair, hubby in video or out of video.. who cares all theses yrs of great content 👌🏾keep it up, your a stunner & your family is lush, stay blessed 🙏🏽
Sam ❤❤❤❤ you're the sweetest we could gush on here for ages 😂 let's make the meet up happen xxx
WE MISS JASON!!!! i miss him cooking, and talking , and living. come back!!
Jason kinda dancing behind you in the background made my day 😂
okay a lot of you must not pay attention to her videos she's answered so many questions like more than once before... love ya sammi and also just chill about jason we only see a snippet of sam's life
i love watching you with indie and i've liked your channel for years now. i hate being a dick, but i hope jason treats you well. in videos he can come off rather rude to YOU, not us. i just hope he's nicer off camera and it's a nerves thing. <3 you deserve good things. best of luck.
hey Samantha! I get really bad anxiety when I drink too much coffee.  I used to drink so much before but I have cut down to maybe twice a week! Sounds bizarre as I would drink two/three coffees a day! My anxiety has more or less disappeared!
Cutting out caffeine reduced my anxiety unbelievably! Xxxxxx
Poor woman. Black men have bigger dicks. You should try them
I thought it Sammi was wearing those pink converses to the dinner lol I was so confused!!
I've recently switched to decaf and it's done wonders for my stress/anxiety levels. Good luck!
Am I the only one who thinks Jason has the same voice as Jon Snow???!!! Lol... lucky you, love you Sam 😘
Fenty Beauty is making everyone so damn flawless, I literally have to get it when I get payed, gorg sammi!
U are really queen of the vlogs!! Moment with pink converse on escalators or girl eating from the box while she was waiting on metro...perfect moments;)
When you said I can't be bothered to do it about your hair, it reminded me of the Spice Girls movie when they showed the future scene of them all with children and I forget which girl said it but it reminded me of that scene!! Love you Sam <3
Definitely think about cutting back on the coffee. I've had to do the same because as much as i love coffee it just isn't loving me back
YOUR SUCH A GREAT MOM BE BLESSED!!!
Jason really needs to blog more 😫
nearly died when i saw u mention barbara love love love when u support other women!
Your vlogs are so relaxing! I've watched this like 4 times, lol
Hi Sammi, I'm sure you probably won't see this as I'm late to watch your vlog but I just wanted to thank you. I lost my baby a few days ago but while I was pregnant watching your videos and hearing you be so honest about the raw emotions you went through in pregnancy and still go through now in motherhood has been really refreshing and helpful for me as I suffered from depression and anxiety most my adult life, but you helped. So yeah.
We have not seen the banana bread
Is almost every comment a girl plz don't hate me if u offended
I've kinda missed Jason. Why isnt he in the vlogs anymore?
Your family is adorable, really enjoying these vlogs - love seeing Jason in the vlogs too! 💖
I cut out coffee from time to time and it helps me with my anxiety. So it most definitely could be a link. Maybe switch to decaf if you need your fix. It does help...do try it lovely xxx
I can't wait to see the bag!!!!
Aww Sam you're a great mom \nLove your little family
Be careful out there Sammi! I always think of you anytime I hear about the awful events in London, especially in the subways 💜
That salad actually looks and sounds amazing to me!!
Does anybody know where Sammi's pink jumper is from? Not too sure if she mentioned it or not...? xxx
I would 100% recommend quitting coffee. I had really bad anxiety for years and was advised to give up and now my anxiety is so rare I can't even remember the last time I felt anxious. I know it's  brutal having  a baby with no coffee but I will take exhaustion over anxiety mixed with caffeine and exhaustion any day! hope it helps xxx
Honestly Sammi, I find it all the time that I have a bit more coffee than usual or than I need and bam... my anxiety hits me like a ton of bricks. Just the wrong amount of it builds it up so much for me, so cutting down will hopefully help any anxiety you have!
I gave up reg coffee years ago cuz I got bad anxiety. I drink decaf when I do drink coffee and I like it! Doesn't make me anxious. Also I looooove this tea by celestial it's called TENSION TEA. I'm not sure if they sell it in the UK but if they do it helps loads! It's for headaches but it's so calming. When I'm feeling anxious it calms me down. It's a life saver! I even keep a few in a ziplock bag in my purse in case I'm out and about and I feel anxious.
I think that people would like to see u editing/working/filming etc. because thats motivate us to work and set our goals hahahahah  ❤️  We like see your normal part of the day doing boring stuff and in this way I don't feel depressed for my everyday boring life too hahah
Hmm I think your jumper was upside down 🤔😂
i laughed out loud. thanks for sharing your personality with us -- it's really a joy.
Where is that pink chunky sweater that you were wearing in the beginning of this vlog from? The one that people were saying you were wearing inside out..
Coffee defiantly personally does effect my anxiety I'm not a very anxious person or one that has trouble with anxiety regularly but it kind of just comes in waves and coffee kinda helps it come up personally
Jumpers on backwards in the dining room clip 😂
Love your outfit for the dinner! Your hair pulled back looks so nice!
Is that the Skip Hop high chair? Do you recommend it?
I also realized that cofee make me anxious
So cool seeing you as a mom and wife. You make it look easy💕💕
Great video as always. Yours are my favourite to watch. I love Jason's dancing at 5:25 😂
inspired to bake! also love the BTS of you filming. such a pretty makeup look :) \nyou're totally right about how exercise like filming! just gotta do it and you never regret it
Your living room is a dream come true.
Where are your curtains from the pink ones ? 😍😍😍❤️
Where is the rug in your office from? Been looking for one just like that for ages! Xxx
you and barbara should totally do a collab! i've been waiting for a video of you two together for years! ♥
nice one with the banana bread :D
well I'm even more of a coffee addict than you and I've noticed that even when I have minimal amounts I still feel very ancious and drained. So I guess it depends
I also think that coffee makes anxiety worse because it releases adrenalin in your body so you're going to feel even more nervous... I'm currently cutting it down also, and drinking green tea instead which makes the transition soooo much easier
Didi anyone else at the beginning of the video hear It's cheeseday? :'D
I just love your vlogs. I don't even mind watching you make a salad. Indie is such a playful & intelligent baby. I love her smile, one can tell that she is loved very much! I can't wait until she starts talking. Thanks Sam for showing us more of your life. Yes, caffeine is very bad for anxiety. I've had years of struggle with anxiety. I also believe that making sure we eat enough and not skip meals is important too. Do they have decaffeinated coffee in England? We have it here in the States & it helps me to drink that. There still is a tiny amount of caffeine in decaffeinated coffee but, it's very low. You look so happy! \nLove,\nDebbie 💋
I need to make that banana bread sounds really good <3  Hope all is well lovely - really enjoy these vids I watch the while my little one naps and they always chill me out :) xx
This was the best vlog so far :D Keep it going girl :*
Hi Samantha, is your Missoma initial necklace the small one? And did you go with the Missoma chain?
... And I thought that I was crazy because coffee makes me feel anxious too 😳
I don't know why but I love seeing you tubers make coffee. I like to see what different kinds of ideas they have. So I love coffee talk!
As soon as I watched this I made vegan banana bread haha! Thanks for the suggestion xx
Now I can't wait to see that Maje bag😍
How do you cook with nice clothes on? I would get 10 stains by just walking in the kitchen.
I have a spot on my nose too, I feel your pain 😭😂😘
Can you do a full house tour?
Jason and you are so adorable together 😍❤️ I hope to find somebody who makes me laugh like he does with you Sammy ✨
I had the same reaction with coffee, I started drinking it everyday in college and my anxiety was horrible. I thought it was stress from school that was making me feel not like myself but after I stopped caffeine I felt much better. Also it stains teeth and gives you heartburn lol
You looked so gorgeous with your hair pulled back and with the red lipstick <3
Sam: Please excuse my appearance  but she looks gorgeous😩❤️😍😍😍😍
Less coffee more MAGNESIUM. Best thing for anxiety EVERRR
Coffee definitely makes my anxiety worse I cut out all caffeine for a while and it made a massive difference :)
the face indie did wenn she found you behind the sofa 😍
I am always really loving your videos. It's as if ur my friend or something and you give positive energy. Love that! And btw, the house is looking awesome!
Am I the only one who thinks Jason sounds and looks slightly like Jon Snow King in the North? Also he would make a good actor in GOT...
Just have to say.... ur the only person I watch that is real!! Who doesnt come across as self obsessed like so many others!! Just normal!! So funny and naturally pretty! Definitely my number 1 to watch!! 😘😘😘😘
indie is too cute x
Loved this vlog and loved seeing the family together, it's a shame people keeping being so rude to Jason in the comments. Let the man live people
btw i started watching the handmaid's tale on your recommendation and omg it was so good!! haven't been that into a series in quite a while. thank you!!
Yes Sammi and Barbara, my og favourites xxxx
Try decafe coffee just as nice☕️☕️
Barbaraaa 💘
Vegan, yes!
Lovely table!
<3
i love love loveeee your tattooed arm !!! it looks so freaking cool , cool mummy
❤️❤️❤️
Jason reminds me of Kit Harrington lol.
Love watching Indie.. she is adorable😘
Jason having a moan about Sam's mum being late 🙄🙄🙄 Here's an idea - look after your own kid you slack shit, since you do nothing all day???!
I miss Jason in the vlogs! Came back to us Jason :P
Jason !!!! Thank you so much for saying hi to us. Do you know we all missed your chats in Sam's video.  Good to hear and see your dancing behind the scene. Sam nothing is boring...daily videos are my fav and i enjoy very much...heee..yea cant wait to see the make up video and the items you bought. Falling in love with Indie everytime we watch her growing....she is the center of attraction. Will love a home tour video when you are ready....😊
Jason has to be the worst youtube husband ever. Doesn't seem supportive at all. A smile would suffice? These vlogs are part of Sammi's livelihood and unfortunately for Jason he is going to be filmed sometimes.
where are all you friends you used to be so social in your old videos before you got with jason and now you do everything on your own
I know you're probably super busy already but if you could put links to outfits in vlogs i would love you forever! i need me that blush jumper in the beginning girl! Aside from that thanks for always being entertaining.. your family makes my heart happy <3 x
Just love your fenty make up it looks so glowy and natural love you!!
You always look so amazing!
Why does Jason act dickish in the vlogs?
Is her fenty beauty vid up yet xx
i wish jason would talk more on the vlogs :( why not make it a family vlog channel?
Jason 😍 Loving vlogtember Sammi 😘
HELLO FRIENDS!! i dove back into the sea of ~wish~ once more to see what all this free stuff was about... are there any other strange websites you would like me to try?
You should try buying makeup from wish
I actually bought that watch so I'm glad that I know it's super flipping long haha
can you get a wedding dress from wish
I am inlove with those shorts!!! I am gonna go find them on wish and get them in black and maroon!
I don't see any free items on mine :(
i hella lol'd at the demon pants hiss
All of these are proxy sites for Aliexpress
Is it bad I'm wearing soffee shorts while watching this?????
I do have the bralet and the LOVE shirt. I actually like them. I also got like a pillow case, shorts and these cute shirts
Omg when did she start using the intro 😂
Saf, anything with the fast shipping (orange truck icon) is more expensive!
you remind me of a anchor woman.
Here I am, here's my shoulder.\n\nMe, knowing I'm breaking dress code 😂
Hey Safiya, I love your videos and you seem like an awesome person! I was wondering if you would do a video on Zaful? The site shows cute and affordable clothes, not sure how the quality is. Hope you'll look into it.
I think the reason why they cost money is because of the shipping
Who else had the wish commercial
AWESOME INTRO keep up with the good work!!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
Im a big wish user, but i usually try to stick to the 1-3 $ range. Ive found with the regular items that are usually a 1 $ for shipping and 1$ for the product, when its free the shipping is suddenly 2$... love the sight, but they are tricksters.
You should mix all of your favorite lipsticks together
I had a wish advertisement before this video.....
You should try a Wish makeup haul. I don't know how brave you are to subject your skin to that, but I would love to watch!!
I just wanted to say, I LOVE that top! :P (The one you wore at the beginning of the video)
maybe the cost is handling? since shipping you have to pay for too
MOM !!!! WHERE'S THE MERCH ????
I’ve been buying shit from wish since 2010, I get stuff literally in the mail every day from wish, you’re taking an L with some of the stuff you buy 😂👎🏻
Why does she talk like that
She recorded the first part (before the time skip) during the eclipse (August 21?...20 I forgot)
you should buy the first 5 wish verified items you see!!!
got a wish ad for this video
Wish is a learning curve for people who didn't know Iv been using it for years since it came out\nWord to the wise since they started the free item the cheepst shipping price will be $2\n+Safiya Nygaard LOL smh I could teach you sooo much  gurl :P
Im waering the fucking bergendy shorts while watching this and its from wish
Love Safiya but this video sounded hella scripted :/ No shame in having an idea of what you're gonna say but that intro was just sooooooooooo noticeable
Wish isn't a store. It's a marketplace. It's like ebay. It's many sellers, mostly from asia but there are some parts and electronics sellers from America/Canada.
Noticed that wish is cheaper in the US when you translate it to my country's currency >:/
Ask help from ur mum and dad
Safiya can you review romwe for us
I got that watch in brown and it actually fits great and looks fabulous lol. I have bought tons of stuff from wish and only had issues with a couple.
the way she reads the titles HAHAHA
Who else got a wish commercial
What video is the laptop cover from 0:08
and if you use the app it shows which are free
Can you do the celebrity dress pls
FOLLOW ME AND WATCG FIGURE SKATING GONE WRONG!!!!! U will be very interested and will hope I make more!!!!
Those shorts I got the same ones from wish and I got the wine red and I LOVE IT SO MUCH
Got the shorts and some patches myself for free, they were perfect and came early
What a coincidence before the video started I had an ad that was for wish
Who else got a wish ad before this video??
Please do a haul from Hush!
If you look at the cost of shipping before it is listed as free and then again when listed as free, the shipping changes to add some of the cost into the shipping. So it is not free.
I literally lost it when you read out the descriptions 😂😂💀💀
I can't find any free things on wish! Help!
Saf this sounds really cheesy but when my dog passed away you wher the only youtuber I could watch. Thank you. :)
I have the same off the shoulder love shirt
I really enjoy these wish videos I would love to see more
Can you do like verified wish items
Can you do a video on top selling stuff from amazon maybe stick to top 5 pants top 5 shirts top 5 make up
Got same phone case from Same place love it but you're right no protection
It just says free but its just trying to make you think your getting a deal but that was probably $1 with $1 shipping, they just said it  was free and put $2 on shipping ☺️☺️☺️
But you Lord,are a shield around me,my glory, the one who lifts my head high. Psalm 3:3\n\nThe heavens declare the glory of God;the skies proclaim the work of his hands.  Psalm 19:1\n\nMay God Bless Everyone!!!!😍😇💒👑/Que Dios los Bendiga a Todos!!!!😍😇💒👑
Hey can you do a 1-2$ ring from wish and 30$ I phones
Hey, be careful with that jelly case! I happened to see a thing on reddit about the chemical filling leaking out and causing severe chemican burns on girls thighs and butts.
I got some really pretty earrings from wish I got butterfly ones and double sided ones
I LOVE THESE VIDEOS! KEEP THEM GOING💙💙👑
I want to see you order stuff from zaful and sammydress and just show us what it's really like
I actually really love Wish! You just gotta know what to look for and always read the reviews of the product AND the store. Even if you receive something you don't like you can easily just get a refund. Wish actually has a money back guarantee! I've gotten some really great items that I love and will be buying more of. Like I said you just gotta be careful about what you buy lol I know that's probably annoying to most people but I don't mind because like I said before, I can always just get a refund and most of the time instead of having to send it back, they let you keep whatever you bought.
Wish is totally hit or miss. I've ordered baby stuff and clothes. Most of the stuff is poor quality.
THE MIDDLE FINGER CAT SHIRT \n(i think thats it )
Know what the best part of this video was? I had a wish app preroll ad.
Hi safiya you alright? Love your videos. Always entertaining. Can you do a video on the app joom buy products and try them out like you did with the wish app. Thanks in advance xx
The shorts look like every Japanese school girl in  gym class that every anime has to include by law :-D
I could listen to Safiya reading off wish item names all day haha 😂
Either I'm crazy or she sounds like Emily Prentiss from Criminal Minds. I am currently fangirling. 😂🤙
Who got a wish ad before the video
I had this app then deleted it but now I think I'll re downloaded it bc of you. Don't know why my body is doing this rn but it is.
I love her videos but she does complain a lot and it gets annoying
I have those shorts from wish in two different colors haha. I love those shorts! I got lurred with the free thing but just opted out for looking for the right size and color I wanted in the cheapest price haha
SAF!!! Crusty will never have looked so handsome... Just please don't put him on Tyler's ass... Please try this!!! As a vet student and avid procrastinator via your channel, this would be like the holy grail haha https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/petflair/petflair-custom-swimwear-featuring-your-pet
i had a wish ad lol
I'm cryiiiiiing😂😂😂😂😂😂 .. with the t- shirt
I live for the article names
Last year I put some stuff in my wish list on wish (this is not the basket) and they sent it all to me and tried to make me pay for it, I managed to get out of it with out paying for it
Word of advice, prices on items on wish seem to be constantly changing. I have things in my cart that will change price from day to day. Not exactly sure why or how, but that's wish for you
Plzzz do a full face makeup from wish
I think they are trying to rip people off
Who else thinks her subscribers should be called the nygaardians of the safaxy 😂❤️Like if you agree
Saf I came up with a great idea, I know you like to do the wearing...clothes from...for a week series so I thought you should do 'Wearing YouTubers merch for a week' YouTubers clothing merch can include: Logan Paul, Sugg Life, PointlessBlog, Dan and Phil, Joey Graceffa, Conna Franta, Troye Sivan, Pewdiepie, Tyler Oakley etc. \nPlease do this video, I would love to see what you come up with ❤️❤️
Romwe or SheIn haul?
diahrrea
OHH demon pants LMAO 5:54
you should try ordering from romwe !!!
Wow first!
DOUBLE JEAN TREND

Fuck that shit anyway
9K13K9K8K17K47K89K85K60K59K67K146K......... the likes...seems right

ORDER CHEAP WEDDING DRESSES FROM WISH
Yes please would love to see closet don't mind it being long😀❤
Absolutely looooove this vlog!!! It would be awesome if you could do a closet tour and how you choose what pieces to invest in? Lovely vlog as always!! xxxx
Ooooh I love the make up bag, what an amazing gift! Would love a closet tour to see how the new closet works (and of course what's in it!). Looking forward to catching up on the rest of your videos.\nHugs Adele xoxo
Please full closet tour! I'm so excited to see it.
It isn't a lap table, but we used to have this folding table sat behind our sofa in my uni apartment for when people were over. http://m.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/art/10290221/
Closet tour!! 💖
You look STUNNING.
Try the West Elm storage coffee table - it lifts up into desk/dining table height and still looks very stylish
yes a closet tour!!
For a useful dining table, see tiny house ideas...you can get a table attached to wall that folds down when dining!
My grandparents have something they call a TV dinner table. They are a set of 4, but they are individual wooden tables that fold up and can be put into their holder but you sit on a chair or a couch and put them in front of you to eat in front of the tv but I've used them for a laptop too!! :)
THANK YOU for being so up front about what brands send to you vs. what you buy on your own. God, this is so refreshing. This allows your viewers to actually trust you... unlike many other youtubers out there right now. *eyeroll*
Definitely would love to see a closet tour and also are you going to do fashion week videos like you did last time about what you wore? I loved them!! xxx
Those shoes looked solo cutee😍😍😍and as always love ur vlogss
Closet tour, yes please.
OMG YOU'RE#7 TRENDING IN THE UK
Closet tour - yesss!!
Ugh would love to get goodies like this...getting things in the mail is the best feeling
I love that you tried some products on camera, that's quite rare. I'm always watching PO box openings and thinking 'I want to see you try it!'
I love your videos and i love fashion! 😍 deffo my fave YouTuber! Xx
Looking super gorge girly! X
Love your vlogs Victoria I get so much inspiration I need to start investing in bits and bobs first thing the pink GHD they are so pretty and for a first set these are perfect also Manolos OMG sooo beautiful yes yes yes to a closet tour xxx
Yes to the closet tour! And I would love to see more of your designer dupe outfit videos that you done a while back.

CLOSET TOUR!!!!
Closet tour please ^.^ x
CLOSET TOUR PLZ
closet tour
Closet tour!! 👍👍❤️❤️
omg pls pls do the closet tour!!!! ❤️
Korean folding tables
I found these really nice wooden folding tray tables that we use for dinner, laptop work stations, etc. the top of mine has a vintage wine advert printed on it. It would go with your retro theme really well, plus you can fold them away in the corner when not using them.
Yasssss closet tour pleaseeee 😁😁
Yes! Do a closet tour!!😍
We want a closet tour please ! ❤
closet tour please...loved this vlog❤❤❤
Yeeeah do a closet tour, your shoe and clothes collection is AMAZING
Love your vlogs 😘😊 please do a what's in my bag video.
Our little house doesn't have room for a dining room table so we bought super cute country style wooden trays from Home Bargains that have little quotes on them! We pop our food on there and eat of our laps with them! Also, your PR deliveries are giving me life!!! Those manolo's!!! X
Love your videos. Please do a closet tour
Your hairrrrr!!! 😭😍🌹
Love your IG and YouTube channel! Would love to see you do a closet tour!
I've been waiting my whole life for your closet tour video!!.... or at least since we got a peak of your unreal coat collection when you did your cleanout :D xx
Please do a flat tour! Seeing glimpses but would love to see the whole place (especially the closet) 😊\nDinner issue  - bean bag trays or fold away trays (like mini tables) 👍🏼x
I use a cushion on my lap and a tray on top of it,  I have fractured vertebrae in my back and I have been mending in a recliner lazyboy chair,   so this is how I have been eating my meals,   I have watched a lot of your videos and tutorials while I am healing,   like the sandals ,   I can't wait till I am better so I can wear my boots,   I only wear low heals,   more comfortable for me Chelsea boots is my fav style,   have a good NY fashion week,     I am a Yorkshire girl who lives in New Zealand,
What I would give to look like you with no makeup😍😍
Stunning babe, as always makes me so so happy when you get excited. Nobody deserves all those beautiful gifts more than you 💕
Was wondering if you had seen the new Mulberry mini trunk bag! They're sooo cute! xo
Hi Victoria, you can buy a Turkish style little round table with folding legs. This table is low and you sit on the floor. They come in different sizes. You can bring it out when u want and fold the legs and put behind a sofa when u'r done. You might find it online or if u can get u'rself to the Harringay area of london, green lanes, there are lots of Turkish shops there. U'll definitely find one there. Maybe an idea. Xx
I get so sad when your vlogs are ending, I love every high class minute of them!
We use the small white square table from ikea (can't think of the name but they're £5/7) easy to pop in the corner and use to display bits but light enough to move to the sofa to eat at! My son also uses it for activities.
What a fun time!! Would definitely love a closet tour! Xoxo, Caylie
I love your makeup look for your night out in New York 👌
Another fab video ❤️ would love to see s closer tour x
Yes closet tour!!!!😘 love you victoria
a closet tour would be very cool
What about a TV tray? I don't know if that's what it's called in England. It's a personal sized table that you unfold and use for food while sitting in the couch!
How about a fold away bistro table and chairs?
Honestly can't wait for you to have your own house because I already know how amazing your walk in closet is gonna be! xx
Yes please to the closet tour! \nA possible idea for dining in a flat - an outdoor bistro style set with a small table and two chairs that all fold up. We've got a set in mint green and bring it inside for extra seating when we need it and it looks really cute! But of course, you'd still need somewhere to keep them whilst folded - behind the settee, behind a door, under the bed?!
You say Lykke the same way you say Hygge just with  an L and a K :) Closet tour...hell yeah! xx
The Kurt Gieger boots are so beaut it hurts!! 😍😍😍 I'll have to save up for them 💛💛💛
I love how Alex is smiling at you while you were unpacking your little bag at the end...it's so sweet to see how much he loves to see you getting exited ☺️❤️
I really want to try the balmain lipsticks. I saw the advert which is amazing, the colours are insane. Yes please can we have a wardrobe tour. It may need to be two videos lol. Some fab products to try and some much in one video you busy bee. Xx
I love the new shoes from Manolo, especially the second pair!  You lucky girl!
Love all the vlogs, such an amazing chance to see you in your day-to-day life! A closet tour would be absolutely fab! A totally unrelated question: where do you do your brows? They are always on fleek! (and I keep wondering for the past 5 videos I think)
You should buy some folding TV trays to eat on.
We use the oblong trays that have a cushion on the underneath for eating our meals without a diningroom table, the cushion makes it comfy and so it doesnt slide off your knees.
use a TV tray. they're individual trays on a stand you can put in front of a chair or couch. and they fold up really small. it's probably easier than sitting on the floor. but probably not super sturdy or for fancy dining. good\nluck~
I'd love to see a make up collection video 💕
Alex' look at 16:36 😂 he knows how crazy Victoria is about make up 😂 so cute
Please do a closet tour!!
You could always get little tray tables so you can sit on the couch and eat? A little like a TV dinner 😂 but they work and can be stored easily!
Also - I have a coffee table that lifts up to dining room table height. Love it!
You can get some cushioned lap trays. They will suffice until you get a better table solution. Great for dining and easy to store. x
So excited for you always!please do a tour please😘
I WANT TO SEE A CLOSET TOUR <3 p.s. those manolos!!
Big 👍👍👍👍👍for the video and for a future closet tour!! Secondly Welcome to the U.S. I hope that you thoroughly enjoy yourselves here! Please stay and be safe!!
Yes Victoria, we would love to see a closet tour!! can''t wait to see you at fashion week!!! Loved your watch at the end of the vlog.
Hope we will be getting 'what I wore for FWNY' video with Instagram inserts like last fashion week(s) and get to hear ur process of putting outfits together, instead of solely seeing new gifted & purchased pieces.\n\nAnd for gen content I would love to see a video about multiple ways to wear one statement designer piece? Maybe starting with all the ways you wear your statement white blouses? Or maybe just choose one pair of shoes to base a look book around?! Xxxxx\n\nTweeted u about beanbag dinner trays
JonTron Video with 300,000 Views in 50 Minutes = Nowhere on the Trending Page\nFashion Video with 40,000 Views in 24 Hours = 16 On the Trending Page\n\nOut of curiosity, how much *does* is cost to bribe YouTube to be on the Trending Page?
Lol .. ours is tv breakfast tv lunch and TV dinner 😂😂😂😂
You're definitely my favourite now. Really enjoy your videos and look forward to the next one. I'm probably older than your usual demographic but I don't care 😀
where is the white band you wear around your head when you do your make up from?
your skin looks beautiful!
We used to live in a small flat in London and had a table similar to this. It can go from a normal height coffee table to a fold out dining table. It's kind of two sides of a table on top of each other which swivel and fold outwards. Or you can keep it smaller and just raise the height. It was honestly perfect! I think the brand was Callagaris we bought it from a furniture shop in spitalfields \n\nhttps://www.heals.com/magic-j-table.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6YXbsY2n1gIVQr7tCh2g3A7TEAQYFyABEgJJlvD_BwE\n\nI can't find the calligaris one we had but it was more like this https://www.styleourhome.com/mascotte-wenge-multi-purpose-table.html?utm_source=google_shopping&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsdDaiJGn1gIVZ7vtCh1ZlASaEAQYCCABEgJl6_D_BwE\n\nWe used it for 7 years and my bro now has it in his flat another 7 yes on and the mechanism still works perfectly xx
You really have opening products with your left hand down pat.  Victoria Beckham - how wonderful.  Alex is really cute and patient half watching you on the bed lol.
Victoria, you really shouldn't hang your knitwear, it's going to ruin it in the long run (I've learned it the hard way!)
creased when alex was watching what you got gifted then realised it was make up and lost interest 😂
what is name of your favorite ray bane sunglasses ? i cant remember .... :/ also it is soooo sweet to see how you shine when you are with your boyfriend
I don't know hoe big the livingroom is but maybe smering like a walltable with some low barchairs?
i was expecting a video and got a vlog😤
I dont care much for shoes, but those you got are sooo beautiful! Hope you keep getting all these wonderful things. Cause you really know how to show them. Love!
I have some friends who have a small apartment in NYC and they bought a kitchen table and cut it in half and used brackets to attach it to the wall, almost like a breakfast bar. It looks super cute and quirky!
What a question.  Oh course you need to do a huge Closet Tour 😍😍😍
OMG, I'm in love with your living room carpet! Where did you buy it? xoxo
Hey vic, mind to let us know what nail colour you wore in this video?? It's amazing😍
You're really passionate about your clothes, shoes, bags and make up products it's just wonderful to see!! Xxx
I can't believe you got thousands worth of dream products and just rattled it off like a Tesco order! So jealous!!
I honestly forget he's never worn glasses before?
It's really cool that he got Dan Howell to write his outro
he looks so good in these glasses i'm gay
I definitely want to make a making the perfect clone video now too
He mentioned Harry Styles, and suddenly he looked exactly like Harry Styles
I thought it looked like Harry styles too 😅
i know what you're thinking. the pj clone is missing some hair.\n\nyup, spot on.
An antisepticeye collab is what I need in my life
did the people who disliked this think pj was actually doing a tutorial on how to clone yourself or???
You are a strange one. Though I'm sure you already know.
0:23 have you lost your mind boooiii  😂
Don't have the intenion of following the plans arranged in just 15 Minutes but instead using the time to create a clone. I like that idea
What are the chances that PJ is a clone, too, and the real PJ made him so he can film a perfect clone video
Love this type of your videos
wow
Those star wipes tho 👌💯💯
Pi Yei me trago todita tu reata me encantas te amo pinche putito
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what nightmares are made of.
Those glasses I need some like them !!
Can anyone tell me the name of the background music / song used at 0:41?? I've been trying to find it for ages.
Where's Wheezy Waiter and his cloning machine when you need him amiright
the hair is the best part
Why does he look like harry styles?
“looks a liitle bit like Harry Styles”
Can you make another Crafting with my son? You + Brad is incredible comedy
Later that day, Pj gets a copy right strike from Planet Skin.
where have you been all this time
It's not the perfect clone because you forgot your glasses... But I guess it'll do haha
sometimes his videos get 10x times weirder or stranger... 😂♥️
Pj I have bad news....I think your clone is a bit....defective...
*Oh eyo! Wel-welcome tew Planuf Flesh. We got what you need here. We got planufs from out of this world and in this world. Come on by and grab urself your own diy clone kit diy kit. You have to MAKE the kit before you can TAKE the kit. Eyoooooo.* Planuf Flesh, no we're not a smex shup.
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS IS HILARIOUS
frick yes this is brilliant
I fucking love all of these star wipes😂😂
is this a jacksepticeye clone or smthin
Best quote of the video: Set your face aside to dry
Hello; and welcome to planet flesh....oh wait that sounds like a sex shop.. hahahaha love you peeeej
Can someone tell me the name of the song he played at the start - thanks
I mean, the clone ain't wrong
This is james potter with lily potter's eyes.
Hello and welcome to planet flesh....sounds like a sex show. 😂
Thanks now I can't go to sleep lol
um peej is this where the patreon moneys went?
No he lost his mind a looong time ago
woah we have the same glasses. we're meant to be
Your clone looks like a girl
When I saw the thumbnail all I thought was: PJ has a twin?!
What the hell did i just watch? 😂
but peej, doesn't he need glasses?
I can't tell the difference \n\n\nAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Are you like me and don't want to get out if the bed in the morning.....\n\n\n\n\n\nI have never related to anything so much in my life.
I worry for you sometimes pj 😂
Pj in glasses is my new favorite thing
Very helpful video. Would love to return for more clone content.
I thought it looked like harry styles too! lol
I was 2 minutes in and I already choked on my lemonade
5:59 was very Fistshark-y. maybe it was the just remember
You are the cutest cutie in this whole gosh darn world.
PJ x Clone PJ the ultimate ship
I actually want to make my own clone
If this is what the patron money is going to then SIGN ME THE HECK UP
I don't have to make a whole clone. I just have to take off my makeup with a makeup wipe and ask someone to take it with them my face is all on there anyways
the PJ clone kind of resembles Wybie Lovat from Coraline
It.....uhm....HE seems the boy of Coraline, isn't it?
Sophie walks in,\nPJ what the- ***remembers its PJ***\nNever mind, PJ
I'm shook I'm watching this in bed and it's picture day
Please stop with the star Transition
NO PJ I'M your clone😂\nAccording to my family anyway
Peej u have glasses now.... PUT THE GLASSES ON THE CLONE!
It's on trendiiiiiinnnnnngggg
What the actual fuck. - which is pretty much every intro to your videos. 😂
The hair is the best part
This is fucking terrifying
I knew this was going to be a masterpiece when i saw that first star transition
This had the same effect on Peej's fandom as The Memeing of Life did on Dan's and it's so hilarious to watch.
The hair lowkey looks like Harry Styles' hair😂😂
Somebody asked me who my favourite youtuber is and I said KickThePJ, I showed them this video and I think they think I'm a weirdo. So... thanks PJ

#PJ'SCLONETAKESOVERTHECHANNEL
Sooooo like black widow. I'm done goodbye 👋🏽👋🏽👋🏽😐
This is basically The Red Room Movie we'll never get for Black Widow from Marvel.
Jennifer Lawrence as an escort assassin? Count me in.
This is gonna flop just like Mother...Jennifer needs to take a break and choose her roles more wisely....overexposure can kill a career.
So... It's literally Black Widow? A Russian woman trained by a covert intelligence facility who gains an ally in an American spy who convinces her to leave Russia? Wow, Fox.
So is marvel suing? i mean, this is clearly a ripoff of black widow
So it's Black Widow's origin movie? Got it. \nUnoriginal Hollywood hackjob #31678.
Im thinking Black Widow and 50 Shades of Grey, anyone else?
The unofficial Black Widow movie lol i love it!
Black swan + John Wick = Red sparrow = Black widow
Jennifer Lawrence is a nigger
This is the black widow movie....its literally a colour and an animal and its the exact movie they were trying to make
So, basically Marvel didn't want to do a Black Widow origin story and Fox decided to make it instead.
I see no negative comments in the comments section, yet there are 1K dislikes... Why do people hate this trailer again? Is it a This movie is trying to portray all women as people who manipulate emotions because that isn't true (heh) or JLAW isn't suitable to play a sexy role (?)
How to manipullate men using their bodies.  You mean like EVERY single woman since the dawn of TIME, wow, we need a special program in Moscow for that one... TERRIBLE premise NOTx
That's CAPTAIN Red Sparrow
Came here excited to see Joel Edgerton, but left disappointed after seeing Jennifer Lawrence 😒
can someone tell me what matthias schoenaerts won in the academy? imdb isnt showing.
0:25  переснимете этот эпизод, не позорьтесь.  Не может такого быть, шалава за 2 бутылки водки, ахаха. Не такие есть, но они вокзальные шалавы, с опухшей мордой, не в гостинеце точно. Там должны быть доллары. Минимум 5 000 рублевые банкноты.
I just hope they don't make her have lesbian scenes just because she's strong and seduces her victims like in Atomic Blonde.
So many flavours and they go with Salty. Pun very much intended.
Someone please make a gif and crop it from starting at 1:01 please!
Guys this has nothing to do with super hero's or atomic blonde.\nThis is about the sparrow school which was a sub branch of the KGB that was disguised as a ballerina school which trained orphaned girls to became KGB spy & assassin's.
Solo film about the Black Widow in MCU we must will forget...
Lmfao! this is like the Black Widow movie we never got! even the origin looks like the same.
First a Mockingjay now a Sparrow :P
Another movie with Jennifer Lawrzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Longing\nRusted\nSeventeen\nDawn\nStove\nNine\nKind-hearted\nHomecoming\nOne\nFreight car
yes please... 😍
Boring. Female assassin how edgy.
So they decided to make a Black Widow movie after all
Does anyone know the name of the song in the trailer? It's so good.
It's What If Mystique was Black Widow?!?
LOL it's basically a BLACK WIDOW MOVIE
The evil Russians and their Agents. Hollywood is so innovative....
Black Widow's Origin story
Could be the first movie I watch that stars Jennifer Lawrence.
MCU stans are so pressed over Red Sparrow. And I'm loving it ...they can keep their kiddy mcu version. Thank god Red Sparrow is gonna be hard R.
JLaw is acting as Dominica but who is Nash?
Not the black widow movie we asked for but apparently it's the one we're going to get
The hell...This is too close to Atomic Blond to the blond wig...seriously?
Hopefully this role gives her some sort of inspiration for mystique now 🍵🐸
So like part 2 of the atomic blonde & black widow?....K
She's not a sparrow, she's a mockingjay... silly people!
i love these new movies she's doing
her at the beginning in the red dress gives me such Emily Browning vibes
This looks spectaclar. Jennifer Lawrence in that brunette fringe looks 5 years old
women trained for combat and using their sexuality as a weapon... kinda sounds like Naked Weapon (an asian film), anyone familiar with it???
Ppl r just hating on this movie because of the stigma that JLaw is overrated. In the end of the day, this is a book adaptation, and from what I can see, it looks well directed, conceptualized, and Jennifer carries the trailer. Stop hating on movies/actors just cos the general public just wants to hate on something.
Imagine if after all the carnage, the film cuts to black and right before the credits roll you hear her retarded laughter.
It's like a mix of Black Swan and Naked Weapon
I guess we finally have the Black Widow movie
So many receipts in the comments
the picture of she in a red room assult me however i find it a strong trailer adviced for pg18
This looks so stunning! J-LAW is amazing!
Ah, I just noticed it was moved from November to March. Why the date shift?
My dad once said - The russians are like a ugly moth - it will charade as a butterfly, but its soul is that of a ugly pest - destroying, feral, barbaric and pathetic little things
I guess they renamed the Black Widow movie.
Normally I would be scared if this were say, Sony or Warner Bros but Fox seems to know exactly what they’re doing with these R rated comic book style movies. Very excited
Mr. Grey will see you now.  *take off your clothes*
The brown hairstyle and color really suits Jennifer Lawrence. She looks stunning, and different too. It may be my bad eyesight, but I couldn't tell it was her at first. 😍
Now that's a trailer
So… you basically just stole the storyline and plot of a Black Widow comic and changed it up a bit?
I had no idea that was jlaw
Is this atomic blonde part 2 ???
This is Naked Weapon 2.
Black Widow meets Girl With the Dragon Tattoo meets Atomic Blonde!
Why so many dislikes ? i loved the  book and this looks great!
BOYCOTT THIS MOVIE!! ITS A BLACK WIDOW KNOCKOFF!!
Black widow?
Looks more like sophie marceau
Nice
Angie did it better.
Ну хоть с челкой угадали...
Dunaújváros? Valaki?
0:56 hehe
music anyone?
. . .screams Black Widow Origins. . .Unrated edition
Anyone else getting Naked Weapon vibes?
*yawn*
Waste of talent.
Idiots. http://observer.com/2017/09/darren-aronofsky-mother-worst-movie-of-the-year/

*_e d g y_*
So... a dramatization of Melania Trump?
So shes Black Widow?
LOVE THIS TRAILERS!! rly love ones.
This looks terrible
Oh...ok...How many more movies do we need of a female Assassin in a white blonde wig with bangs? 🙄 imma prolly still watch tho lol
We will remember those llamas for Centuries
Scrolls through the comments.Criticism towards FOB for churning out recycled mediocre formulaic pop songs stealing from top 40 completely absent. \nWould these fangirls buy a FOB record with Pete Wentz farting into the mike for 40 minutes? You begin to wonder....
AAAH I CANT WAIT TO SEE THIS ON TOUR
This new music is so cool😐😛
I just understood nothing, that was just....strange....
Can't believe I used to like this band
Fell in love with this song the second I heard it. So much I've done a multi instrument cover. Be appreciated if you could give it a watch.\nhttps://youtu.be/SXL7Z555bRg
THIS IS SO GOOD!!!!
Not in front of the puppies, Pete!
normal people : great song !\nMe : okay in which llama is brendon ?
they're not coming to Ireland and I'm so sad
OMG I LOVE THIS SONG
In the credits it say
Was the budget for this video $5
I'm sensing a new era has come
I didn't know the llamas were played by llamas
Fantastic one guys. One of my favourites so far
Im just a Fall Out Boy with a Stand Up Girl. Shes got that ultra kinda love ya never walk away from. Shes just the last of the real ones.
Kanye West did this in Flashing Lights.  Why did they emulate that video concept here?  Song isn't as good as Flashing Lights and I can't stand Kanye West.
Uhh I can't stop hitting the damn replay button, SEND HELP!!
I think the FoB Fan Community should get the name Llamas or little llamas because of the upcoming album \nSay if you like it
i just need like huhuhuhu such a cancer
That's the only song i really enjoyed from MANIA like the old ones
I just realized this is the flashing lights music video by Kanye but with llamas
Wow look at all that blood on that shovel
How could Brendon just watch someone who helped with his fame get murked
Obsessed with this song ♥♥♥
3:11 reminds me of Sam and Dean for some fucking reason
When they say bun na na na na. I think of them saying banana instead
The end credits is what I strive to be
I was just an only child of the universe\nAnd then I found you\nAnd then I found you\nYou are the sun and I am just the planets\nSpinning around you\nSpinning around you\nYou were too good to be true\nGold plated\nBut what's inside you?\nBut what's inside you?\nI know this whole damn city thinks it needs you\nBut not as much as I do\nAs much as I do, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause you're the last of a dying breed\nWrite our names in the wet concrete\nI wonder if your therapist knows everything about me\nI'm here in search of your glory\nThere's been a million before me\nThat ultra-kind of love\nYou never walk away from\nYou're just the last of the real ones\nYou're just the last of the real ones\nYou're just the last of the real ones\n(You're just the last of the real ones)\nYou're just the last of the real ones\n(You're just the last of the real ones)\nYou're just the last of the real ones\n\n[Verse 2]\nI am a collapsing star with tunnel vision\nBut only for you\nBut only for you\nMy head is stripped just like a screw that's been tightened too many times\nWhen I think of you\nWhen I think of you\nI will shield you from the waves\nIf they find you\nI will protect you\nI will protect you\nJust tell me, tell me, tell me\nI, I am the only one\nEven if it's not true\nEven if it's not true, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause you're the last of a dying breed\nWrite our names in the wet concrete\nI wonder if your therapist knows everything about me\nI'm here in search of your glory\nThere's been a million before me\nThat ultra-kind of love\nYou never walk away from\nYou're just the last of the real ones\nYou're just the last of the real ones\nYou're just the last of the real ones\n(You're just the last of the real ones)\nYou're just the last of the real ones\n(You're just the last of the real ones)\nYou're just the last of the real ones\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm here at the beginning of the end\nOh, the end of infinity with you\nI'm here at the beginning of the end\nOh, the end of infinity with you\nI'm done with having dreams\nThe thing that I believe\nOh, you drain all the fear from me\nI'm done with having dreams\nThe thing that I believe\nYou drain the fear from me\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause you're the last of a dying breed\nWrite our names in the wet concrete\nI wonder if your therapist knows everything about me\nI'm here in search of your glory\nThere's been a million before me\nThat ultra-kind of love\nYou never walk away from\nYou're just the last of the real ones\nYou're just the last of the real ones\nYou're just the last of the real ones\n(You're just the last of the real ones)\nYou're just the last of the real ones\n(You're just the last of the real ones)\nYou're just the last of the real ones
Nice Homage to Flashing Lights by Kanye West
body removal by: His name is Jeff,  stunts by: patricks hand
The ending credits are wild af
I'm positive that at least half of the views on this video were me, I'M SO ADDICTED THIS SONG IS AMAZING
And the wild life channel just got got weird
Anyone else think of Llamas with Hats?
i love this song
I ate too much food and ended up here
Everyone: can we have a music video that fits the song? \nMusic artists: ha
Why this shit not on trending but Jake Paul shit song was number 1 on trending
ummmmmmmm......... THIS IS AMAZING.......I'M IN LOVEEEEEEEE
Stunts by Patrick's hand
Real talk, this is wonderful.
i want the credits rolled on a big protector at my funeral please and thanks
His name is Jeff
The video is the same of flashing lights - Kanye West
you will never escape the llamas
Hopefully this isn't the last FOB song
This video is horrible? I was excited to see something crazy but its literally just slow motion walking for 3 and a half minutes then a pan out of someone stabbing someone with a shovel with no blood??? What the hell, FOB? Did you spend like four dollars on this music video? At least their music is still good, but jesus christ, this video is straight garbage.
i love how fall out boy still used their rock but all they did was put some upbeat background music which makes it better. some people dont really like how they changed but i am a fan that likes their old music and new music. this is great
Glad they recognise the plight of furries
finally a decent track from this album
Brendon Urie : murdered by squid / octopus \nPete Wentz : murdered by llama
The lyrics (not the video) kinda reminds me of the relationship between All Might and Deku
THIS SONG IS OFFICIALLY MY NEW BOP
Look like flashing lights music video
The Llamas are Tyler and Josh of 21 Pilots!!! HAHAHAHAHA
good song, didn't fit the video at all tho
If the rest of M A N I A is this good could be best album ever
i am looking for Brendon Urie, anyone see him? lol
The end credits are killing me
Seriously..? I guess I am the last of a dying breed.\nhttps://youtu.be/ila-hAUXR5U
We're all gonna turn into furries
What the fuck is up with the llamas though?
I don't get it
Can someone make a Lucifer(the marvel TV series)  version of this plz.
I'm pretty sure this isn't how the story ends 🔮
WOW! Great song, loved it.
The white llamas hat is kept up by Brendon's forehead
Guys chill they only put Pete in the trunk bc he was the only one who would fit \nEDIT: THE CREDITS IM DEAD
What do llamas have to do with MANIA
this is what drugs do to you kids, stay communist.
If all of you didn't notice (not trying to be rude, just the facts here) when the llama dude supposedly stabbed Pete repeatedly with a shovel, if you will notice this. Pete was positioned towards the back seats rather than the rear of the car. When the llama starts stabbing Pete, he stabs the rear of the car, as close to the back as he can. You're welcome.
i love this so much
THIS IS MY FAVOURITE FOB SONG EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Like coldplay with the elephants
OF COURSE IT HAD TO BE PETE WENTZ.
*but only for you*\n*but only for you*\n\nPUT ANOTHER X ON THE CALENDAR\n\nI can't be the only one
Boy am I glad that real llamas don't attack people with shovels, or we would have to change the way the criminal justice system works.
So incredibly good!!!
Fall of humanity seasons
WhAT IS LIFE
Brendon?
AMAZING SONG, INDEED!
Jimmy kimmel?
I love it
My new favorite FOB song ❤️
Caaaaaaarl that kiiillllsss people llama with hats
....
Addictes to this song like omg
LOOOOVEEEEEEE
The credits though
cringe at the goats
The Maniacal Llama Chronicles?      The Menace Llama Chronicles?          The Champion Llama Chronicles?          \n  The Young Llama Chronicles?
*FURRIES CAN DO INFINITE CRIME*
Fallout Boy shall rise once again!
I feel like fall out boy are just dead and they're  trying to be trendy there's a difference between fuck society and manufactured fuck society
I am the only one...or this song makes me sad :(
Lmao, the credits:\nBody Removal By\nHIS NAME IS JEFF\n\nStunts By\nPATRICK'S HAND\n\nIkea Monkey Provided By\nANDY

This was really well done.
Dan your crazy bro I wouldn't go out there that late
I take this road to get to my grandmother's house, I hate it lol!!
Wow only a $500 dollar fine to dump a body? That's pretty cheap
So, this place is the most prolific area to find dead bodies (victims of crime primarily, i assume?), and the measures they take are to put up roadblocks lol?
Way cooler than looking for shit stains on a mattress.
I love you guys but you should really censor out the faces of people who wish not to be on camera.
Was that another black sack in the middle of the shot around 30:48?
If you put a jumpscare in the middle of this I would have shit my socks.  I guarantee with that huge park being located so close to projects and high crime areas there must be a huge population of homeless people living out there in the woods.
not really all that creepy just a really high crime rate
These eyes in the dark at 22:22
I feel like im watching the blair witch project lol.
Very good video. So evil for anyone to just kill and abandon a baby anywh... very sad..but it was a cat.. still evil and sad...the cop didn't seem to care... anyway great video
that car stopping to turn around had me soooo so nervous..be safe guys..especially dan when going out alone..i wanna slap you for being so stupid tho ;)
Shooting film out there solo? Dans balls must be the size of coconuts.
Dan, did you notice the anomalies going across the screen around the time you say that your heart is racing, when you are staring at the spot in the woods?
You need to wear gloves so your hand prints are not on anything just in case you did find something you didn't want to see. !!!!!   I just subscribe to your video's.   It popped up on you tube and I took a look.  Very entertaining.    Thanks for the knowledge on what I saw .   Please don't  go in the woods alone take someone with you.   I'm  a nurse just saying please be safe
About to go to bed. so hype for this video tomorrow.
Why so many bodies in one place? Is it a popular dump site or suicide spot? Maybe both?
Actually scares the shit outta me when you go places solo, my anxiety level goes above the roof!
BRING A FRIEND WTF DAN!!!!\n Dude people are fuckin crazy out there in the horrible world we have made it to be where the hell is rick?!
Dude u are such a great film maker
Rancidity. I will never forget that smell.
It's a deer. with cool shots and neat lighting.
FINALLY! A return to the scary documentaries. I much prefer this work vs his other collections. Keep it up Dan and thanks.
Really enjoy your work Dan! Keep it coming.
I like the cop. I ain't opening it, you open it
I just can't wrap my head around how some disgusting monsters put animals into bags and leave them to die. It makes me feel sick.
When walking around in these parks have you ever seen any ghostisis or be abducted by space aliens ?
I love Rick's little outbursts
the message i get from this video is that america is a very fucked up and atavistic place. i'm glad y'all have so many guns to keep you safe.
The editing was really good, which software are you using?
Dan trying to anything to avoid opening for the bag. 😳
No way in Hell
Hay Dan Awesome stuff,\nDo you ever consider getting a concealed weapons permit.\nYou go to some very nefarious places.
One time as a kid their was this short cut we used to use to go to school and home..well I seen a litter of kittens really young probably 3 or 4 of them as I was on my way home. Didn't think anything of them. But later on that night I was going to a friends and used the short cut. I heard one of those kittens and seen it next to another as I got closer..I realized their was blood everywhere and I seen the other two cats body's in the bush..someone had cut them up..really all of them except one..their insides were ripped out and their heads were hanging in the trees by string. Their was stuff written in blood on the trees and in the dried dirt! The lil cat was licking one of the dead ones with no head or arms or tail.. I got this creepy feeling as I was looking around, then I fuckin ran!! All the way to my buddys house.. It was a weird feeling..like I was being watched.
Every time Shooting Solo appears on the screen my anxiety spikes
+This is Dan Bell congratulations on this featurette. Very impressive work.
funny how the cop didnt even want to check to see what it was. that could have been a baby or parts of a chopped up person.that cop should have absolutely wanted to investigate that.
Good to have more Baltimore explorations. Just in time for the Halloween preparations.
We have such a place in my city. It had/has bodies frequently. In the late 1940's an in-law uncle dropped one off. He was hanged within the same year. The 3rd last hanging in the province. No need to bother about strangers with guns when you can slaughter a woman with a claw hammer.\nhuggs,silky\nDan, sometimes I think you are crazy to do these things .... a well haunted woods.
I like how the policeman is like: You can open it if you want.. I would have been like: Bruh, you're the policeman here, you should be the one openng it xD
This was so gay.
OMG you have massive balls doing this mate.cheers from Australia
13:02 - Did anyone catch Hae Min Lee's name? the lady who was covered in the Serial podcast.
Dan Bell makes the best content on YouTube
I liked the approach you used to this video - i.e. without a lot of talking.  It was like a movie - didn't know what to expect.  Excellent shots - WOW!!!
@30:45\nIs that another bag? Maybe another cat?? Maybe a future serial killer's dumping grounds???
Is this where they found Chester's body?
Wait a minute...the goddamn DEER scare the shit out of you?!
Lets go....questions you don't ask in the hood following a crime for $1000. Dan? What is: do you know what just happened? You got it!
Ok devs, make a horror game about dan explorin the park
Ah good old Baltimore. I miss Maryland forests and gang violence
I suggest you look at the footage from 25:17 to 25:20, there is white orb or shadow that goes by the camera.
It does sound like gun fire. The fact that there are cop,fire dept and a ambulance. The place is closed off.
Did anyone else notice the orbs or spiritual energy surrounding him when he was standing in the dark on either the road or path(couldn't tell) He mentioned his arm got really cold.   I was screaming run! To my tv screen lol.  Ahhh.  I don't think he could of seen until he watched his footage.   Creepy!  be safe !
All I keep thinking is , shit I really hope they got a fuckin gun on them being out there like that.................
I used to walk home from work, at night, in the ghetto, every night, for 2 years. Still not as scary as being in the woods at night.
I just saw two eyes, I hope that was a deer.\n\n*The most Jarring thing I've heard in a long time*.
I think downtown Detroit is the scariest place in America. But when that gunfire went off, I didn't even think about it.  Where I live, there's gunfire every couple seconds all around
Welcome to the gun free zone of Baltimore.  That is unless your a criminal.  I certainly hope this guy is carrying.\n  I could never understand why any sane person would want to live in a Hell hole like that.
This reminded me of that movie nightcrawler
Note to self... Do not move to Baltimore. O-o
Great vid as always! But still nothing touches the crack rocks in the abandoned house or the person following you around the kids asylum! Omfg those still freak me out when i rewatch them!
Creepy as hell. Subbed. Would sub a thousand times. Clone me.
so those bones look odd. i would have called the cops.  only becuase catherine hoggle is back in the news and they never found her two kids.
What's in the bag? What's in the bag?
Damn! This is the creepiest thing I've ever watched! Cool video, though!
You guys gotta turn up the ISO every now and then.
25:48-25:52 that sounded like a man humming or singing??? \nGreat video btw! *applauses!*
Anyone been able to recognize what those bones belonged too?\nAnimal? Human?
I remember listening to the serial podcast about hae min lee and hearing about this park. It's nice to get a more visual idea of what it looked like and some info on the place as well. Great vid as always! I got pretty spooked at various parts lol
33:48 I respect what police have to deal with, but to make the person who found it open the bag?  Um, whose the one with the badge who actually trained for that crap again?
that No Dumping sign should have a  human silhouette on it.
Rick is such a ham. Stay safe boys.
This was one of the creepiest videos I've ever seen on YouTube! \nAnd BTW I appreciate it very much that you don't use clickbait for this video.
What's this? The Blair Bitch project?
How much would you have crapped your pants if that bag took off and started running.
imagine if pennywise was in these woods
I'm never going to Baltimore.
The word Infant on the map of bodies found. Geezus.
fuck this is where hae min lees body was left
I'd really like to know, did you report those bones and their location to the police?
Thanks for this. From 2009 to 2011 this was my post (821) and we were finding bodies every few months. During the blizzard of 09' we even had a body dumped on snow bank on Eagle Dr. near the Outward Bound parking lot. It's strange driving through knowing that there are remains somewhere, and sad knowing people have missing loved ones that may never be found.
Should rename this, Dan driving around in the dark finds dead cat.
YES! A SPONSORSHIP YOU KICKASS BASTARD!!!

really well done!.

Welcome to Baltimore!
1:20
Excellent
boring and not spooky at all, you found nothing but a cat in a bag.
Hey Lovely people, I'm loving reviewing these sites and experience and sharing the good, the bad and the ugly with you all! I've linked most of the items in the description box for those asking, however they often sell out or are removed on ebay! Hope you enjoy and see you on Sunday for my next video xx
I've watched multiple haul type videos of ebay and such and she is definitely my fav. You're entertaining and authentic it's nice :) your waaooows are so aww hahaha girl I like you
And I'm offended 😭😭 love her
Can you please put the name of the seller of the yeezy boost ?

I dunno what you did, but you are looking fleeky in this video!
Posted this video on my birthday.😘❤\nLove you Patricia!!!!!!
where'd she get the yeezys
The yezzys on ebay arent real most of the time, chinese companies know the resell price and sells replicas for the price. Because legit cream whites go for 450$ canadian, a giant gap from your purchase sorry :(
Patricia you are so pretty!! 💓💓
The hook from your toes being squished comment 😂😂😂
her use of the word beak to describe things has me dead omg
Love your hair! Real hair or wig? If its a weave can yu make a video about it
You had me rolling at the end with that last shoe lmao

Patriciaaaaaa!! I'm glad your subscribers are increasing everyday. Can you do a little something in honor of your OG subscribers?? Like just chatting or relationship stuff. I feel fatigued by all of the spending you do lol. Not hating, but I love hearing your thoughts on life and stuff like that. Your latest videos are making me feel poor and quite demodée rofl 😂😂😂😂

Is anyone else seeing MacyDress on their Facebook page & do you think it's legit?
I loved the heels in the end , some in black would look so beautiful 💖
I love her accent it is so beautiful 👟👞👢👡👠
Did you buy something from sportsdirect.com sometimes? :-)

That hair. (In Patricia's voice) haiiii haaaiiii haiiii🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🤛🏽👌🏽
Im really excited, which is most of the time. shes so cute omg
The over knees were okayish,but a thicker legged person, would have a bit of a struggle.
Smells like burning fire smells like chemicals you could get high on I cried 😂😭
She didn't list the yeezys in the description box
*spends 500 dollars on Yeezy's to go to the store*
...and I'm offended. Best line of the video. Thanks for sharing your ebay experience with us!

I'm a new subscriber and I love love love your videos already... but I have a request for you to review.... the JOOM app, I've done some shopping on there for jewellery at like 30p and so far so good... but clothes are cheap too, possibly review worthy???
We're the yeezys real or fake?
You didn't say how much you paid for the Yeezy's.
girls, the best fashion dupes are on ioffer.com !!! I got so many and the quality is amazing for super cheap (but you have to wait 3 weeks to receive them...)

BBC are race-baiting pedophile enablers
Watch more of this phony fake witness here: https://vid.me/mAavy
I how long it'll be before the BBC disable the comments
Crisis actors and fake reporting of a staged event.
I thought maybe someone was throwing acid.  Nope, just someone attempting to detonate a powerful explosive in an enclosed space.  some people...
So basically most people were injured from the stampede and not even the failed bomb. Lesson for people, stop stampeding when you suspect a situation, more people can be killed from a stampede than the actual attack
Why there was no cctv,  every carriage has cctv? I want to see cctv of this accident
Can I ask why Emma told Sky news that it was she that lost her trainer yet in this interview she says it was someone else??? Notice how in every phoney fake 'attack' they lose their shoes. Sky helicopter panned onto the platform and lo and behold what do we see ........a pair of neatly placed black shoes and about a metre away a lone trainer. Freemason symbology that means the people participating are doing it of their own free will. Emma managed to mention in this one interview 1. ACID 2. LOST SHOES.3.MEN STRAPPED WITH BOMBS. Not scripted at all eh Emma???
Does anyone believe this?   It is so obviously a drill gone live.
emma stevie still there! helping the news media with their comforting sound bites.
Where do they find theae crappy actors? Why arnt these pillars of the news visiting the 29 injured people in the local a&e why is there a perfectly burning bucket in a plastic bag on a coach majesticaly alight with fairey dust? Sorry ide why is there no damage to the coach or even burn or scorch marks who do the bbc think they are kidding this has to be one of the worst staged terror attacks in history even worse that decrepid old krone zionist may has now raised the threat level so severe whens it going critical? And the ramifications of this act of insanity are mind blowing thats of course if anybody out there is even moderatly sane just observations nothing to worry about. This report has been brought to you all live from bailey rich & divixde and rule news room.
Use your words...stampede, acid, crying little boy, chaos, flames, train.
Everyone gets on at Wimbledon BOI , Most people get on at Earl's Court or West Brompton WTF Where's the logic
Do the people complaining about immigration not realise most of these attacks are done by British Muslims?
scripted..
I read this wrong...
I don't care if your police, i don't care if your a kid, i don't care if your pregnant, you best believe I'm stamping over every single body to get my fatass out

Damage to the train carriage?
*I replaced the pink shirted girl with Daenerys.*
I had no idea you Brits had girls this pretty and intelligent. Maybe it was a mistake for us to fight the revolutionary war for independence from the Monarchy. With girls like that, I think I'm gonna start a petition to rejoin that government and instead of bowing to the Queen, I'm bowing to Emma.
They really need to come up with better scripts for their crisis actors. It's getting more ridiculous every time they stage an attack.
Utter BS!!.I wonder how much she was paid for her extremely poor acting...lol....Why would you even do the noise of the train doors closing....Hahahahahahahahahaha!!
Notice she said we need more people on the underground, see in times like this you're all left to figure it out yourselves. When the unions complain of a system running on minimum numbers they aren't saying it for fun you know.
I just heard that there are 3,000 active investigations of potential terrorists in the UK and another 20,000 that police are concerned about. In the US our FBI has 6,000 possible Isis sympathizers under surveillance. Time to ban Islam and burn all Korans.
It must be horrific to be living your life and then one day a bunch of people show up and terrorise you day in day out!!\nIt's not like it's the1830's!!
I am really insulted by this shit. The BBC are actually saying This is how gullible and stupid we think you are
Wow...pathetic sheep.  Killing each other over nothing.  They were in no danger.  I avoid crowds.  People are very stupid.  This seems staged.
*Look upon the comments and weep*
She has the demeanor of someone talking about their favorite movie and seems to be suppressing a smile throughout the video. Can't say for sure that it's a false flag but yeah, it's a false flag... way to go BBC, fake news since 1922.

shame that bbc cow wasn't stampeded.
So it seems that all of the injuries were caused by the 'stampede' as opposed to the actual so-called 'explosion?'
We don't believe you lying sacks of shit
so the train doors shut, then there was an expolsion and she ran for her life? so presumably she has suoer human traits and can oass through glass?? there were layers of women underneath her screaming..??? not one bit of burn damge in carriage, no smasehd glass, and a smouldering little plastic bucket. a guy who said he was next to the so called bomb was injured? his hair was singed. she is taling aobut crush in a panic. the panic was the issue surely
Emma Stevie works at Delamar Academy, famous for doing make-up for films and TV. What's the connection there? Why isn't she even slightly upset, if she's been in a human pile-up and seen a kid with his face smashed in? Why has she been hanging around all day? Maybe for the free pizza and water, which were arranged in advance for the drill taking place?
loud men shouting RUN...ok @ 0:28
NEW WORLD ORDER
More crisis actors
Read that as human centipede at first :D\nAnd on a serious note...bla bla bla immigration bla bla musles fish stick. Thank you. But seriously I am glad nothing too serious happened.
Errm where's the cordon and bomb squad to sort out that bomb that failed to detonate properly lmfao\n\nCome on people move along,\nWalk straight past bomb on your left please.....
I hope it was only liberals who were hurt.
*Europeans in 2039*\n''Shit... We have no where to go..''
This government seems more interested in political correctness than protecting its citizens from these continuous terrorist attacks.
I don't think we should jump conclusions and say that this was done Muslim terrorists. We now have to consider that Far Right extremist/ White power terrorist are now on the rise and fighting back. And if you thought that the Muslims were bad you ain't seen nothing yet.
Time for India to rule england. British govt is incapable of ruling itself and saving it's citizens from islamic terrorists. England needs to be converted to non-abrahmic religions to achieve peace and stability instead of that satanic dead god which they worship.\nbye.
Now she can apply for a bit part in Hollyoaks.
SHOW ME ...  I DONT BELIEVE A SINGLE WORD ...  MILLIONS OF SPY CAMERAS ..MOBILE PHONES ..  I wont believe it till you show the cctv footage ..  not one person without hair/eyelashes/beard/...  K ill H umanati  at it again ..   playing with our minds ...FEAR FEAR FEAR ...   BE AFRAID ...  the  ill/eat ...are afraid .. that's why they do this ..
this is a sad day for England and the injured people will need at least 6 months off work to recover from this,  there was allot of smoke and a loud bang,  as some people had their ears bandaged in other videos and this alone is a 7k payout ,
So BBC who did it ? Oh that's right fake news .

Paid actors for sure
UK people are selfish and deserved to die more in the future.
People say these are actors which I don't believe. Some people can handle stress better than others and if you get on the battlefield, you'll see what I mean. I have seen people shot in the head and was able to block it out and keep my composure, while others would practically have a mental breakdown and freak out. Seeing people killed with blood everywhere is not something that is enjoyable by any means, but you have to deal with it and move on. In the end we all have to go anyway.
I like her English
Two days, 77k views, and trending?
And they ll still let more f these so called refugees in
Can we hear from the people this woman trampled on?
She doesn't sound very scared or shocked
Here is an example of, the dangers of taking in Child refugees from Muslim countries. They become a huge problem as they get older.
It's tough being a Muslim these days. To any fellow Muslims reading this ditch the ugly ass beards you guys have and dress like a regular westerner, that way people won't be able to suspect ur Muslim unless they ask. And females don't wear the hijab. Honestly for my Asian or middle eastern bros and sisters idk what you can do cos u stereotypically look and fit the description of a Muslim. Hope this helps
I feel so bad thats not even right man..\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/london-train-fire-help-teen-recover
they have not soul, they are barbaric and uncivilized.  they kill anyone.  they must be deported  and their families and friends.   they must leave our countries and stay away, far, far away.     merkels   ideas.   move with brexit, demand  immediately.  last time i was in england, i did not recognized it.   london is unsafe and  now plagued with terrorists.   do not travel to england.
another staged event  with crisis actors ...who is buying  this bullshit ?
The girl in pink is world famous now...she will be in a movie..will get a book deal. write a book...become a porn star...be at super market openings and dine with the royals...she will commended for her bravery and given a medal..she will be a millionaire by XMAS.

Football is shit and the players are all over payed, I don't watch football or support it, the only input I can give is Chelsea beats all.
Game plan pro tip: score more goals than the opposition.

The btec aftv
Board and Bilic OUT! 😣
Unpopular opinion but I would have kept snodgrass and got rid of Ayew instead, has Ayew actually had 10 decent games for us? Should have given snodgrass until January to see whether he could rediscover his hull form

Raghead

Nice,  promoting a symbol of oppression for the whole world to see.
You're that far up your own arse your turning brown......
u gonny build a bomb up there
Take that fucking thing off your head and escape before your man shanks you
Can you vlog your next terrorist attack? Fucking Muslim
Your allah doesn't and has never existed, and your precious prophet muhammad (*piss be upon him*), held up by islam as a shining example of a perfect human being that all should aspire to emulate, was in reality an *illiterate, warmongering pedophile* that has left the world with a legacy of *systematic genocide, generational incest and atrocious intolerance towards other cultures,* now fallaciously described by so many today as a religion of peace.
Oh god a muslim no thank s
Why does she have a curtain wrapped around her head?!
Muslims are not British simple.
He's been hitting the gym big time 👏👏
LET ME DO THE THING nick jonas babe, I let you do whatever you want to me.

There is no need to worry, for God loves you all\nThursday, 8 May 2014 @ 23:30\nMessage 1120\nMy dearly beloved daughter, look around you and you will see many people living carefree lives.\nYou will see laughter, joy and great comradeship and you will know that only this can come from God.\nMany people, once they know the truth, will embrace me with open and grateful hearts and then we will be one.\nMy plan is to gather all and flood them with great love, joy and happiness.\nI will delight in my new Kingdom and there will be much laughter, joy and beauty, as well as eternal life.\nLove will exude from every single creature; every single soul and life will be perfect.\nWhen you worry about the future of the world, remember what I have told you.\nAll will be well, once I come to gather you, into the new world, without end.\nThere is no need to worry, for God loves you all.\nAs for souls who live a deprived and sorrowful life, they will be gathered first, if they accept who I am.\nThose who are in terrible darkness will be given \nextraordinary graces to cleanse their souls, so that I can loosen the \ngrip of the evil one over them and take them into the safety of My \nMercy.\nThis is a battle and it will be hard fought, but the \npower of the Most Holy Trinity will be exerted and \n                 souls will be \nenlightened, so that they will not perish.\nI will raise important leaders amongst you and with an\n army spread in every nation, you will swell and take with you most of \nGod’s children, into the New Paradise.\nLook to me with trust and do not fear My Love, for you\n must know that I would never willingly frighten you, because when I \nmake my presence known, it will fill you with great wonder and joy.\nI assure you, there is no need for fear, for I am love, itself.\nLove will soothe you and when you face me, Your Jesus,\n you will be struck with a sense of instant familiarity, which is only \npresent when your heart becomes entwined with mine.\nHow I love you all and how I yearn for your souls.\nYour Jesus\n\nShare this:
Happy birthday Nick Jonas. YOU'RE SO HOT. Ok bye.
OMG Nick Jonas is such a hunk...like I can't lol
nick looking like a SNACK
Could you please send me his curriculum? 😂
I would eat the pastry he spat on with pleasure while looking at him in the eye
so many hoes in this comment section .
NICK JONAS IS HOT ASFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
I cannot stop staring at his arms!
i'd eat that pastry just saying
Damn! Nick Jonas is looking exxxtra beefy! Yum!
Nick Jonas is soooo hot
Nick Jonas has and always will be my favorite Jonas Brother.
Can I get that pastry???😂😍😍😍
Oh god, the amount of office rules I'll break when he interns at my work
When did his arms got so big 😍😂
His voice 😍😍
Nick 😍💖
❤❤❤
The funny seeing Nick Jonas giving James amassage
So amazing XD
Wish I could change places with the host!!!, minus the audience  :-)
Why do they always do that weird thing at the start when there like yeah hi but I'm not going to saying anything funny until everyone is quite.......
Things you gotta do to promote your SONG!!
is he playing in a movie or does he just want to get huge ?
Nick Jonas stole my heart when I was only 14 and still does the same <3 :)
Saw him live last year...it was amazing!
The way he cleaned that pastry...
he's hot but I miss the slimmer version of him, beautifully perfect now he's a bit chunky... well hot anyways
The great guitar master xD
Oh how I wish he was an intern at my firm...
The reason he's so damn buff is probably because he played an MMA fighter in the TV show Kingdom. He's seriously ripped in the show. Its actually a decent show-turns out the kid can act and very well actually. Unfortunately it only has 3 seasons but its still worth watching.
He's so hot ugh
Is it me it or does his voice sound different?
The only guy that i think is the most humble person ever.
between 1d and nick jonas james is living every girl's dream. \nmaybe not every girl but sure as hell mine!
The way the shirt wrapped around Nicks muscles...  Oh child 🙌
IF NICK JONAS GAVE ME TAT PASTERY I WILL LOVE TO EAT IT HAHAHAH
I wish Nick would rub me like that 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Being a host is such a great job
don't skip leg day kids
He is just air and water. Withour shirt he have any muscle
I've never been more jealous of James as I an right now
Oh jeez he is buff 🔥🔥😏😏

I think I need a massage too…… where's my NICK JONAS?
This is totally FAKE! He was all mic-ed up 😏
Goodness gracious gravy, he's so gorgeous

Rest in Peace Harry
Rest in peace Harry.  You were fucking awesome.
Taken by that increasingly rare ailment 'natural causes'. Rest in peace, Harry.
RIP Harry Dean
.\n**** THREE DIS-LIKES\n..NO SOUL YOU HAVE !!\n*****
Just heard the news of his passing.  RIP, Harry
Rest in Peace, Mr. Stanton.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton.
What a man. What feeling his face and voice conveyed.Today is for crying, but all the tomorrows will be for celebration of a beautiful life well lived.
R.I.P. Harry Dean Stanton. You were loved.
REST IN PEACE  MR. STANTON,  LONG LIVE YOUR TALENTS  🕊😔⚘🎵🎥💕
RIP Harry. Thank you for sharing your talent for so many for so many years. Til the other side...
Beautifully done. I never knew he was a singer.
Rip Harry
good-bye Harry Dean Stanton, The screen will never see your like again
Fifty years ago I went to the pictures to watch Cool Hand Luke  and I enjoyed him singing Just a Closer Walk With Thee which was brilliantly evocative, and very apropos. I think that was the first time I'd ever heard a religious song that wasn't dull. This clip is good, VG considering his age and the effects age has upon the vocal chords.\nHe should have sung more during his career.
He was great in Repo Man.
A Great Actor!!!
Rest in peace Harry. You were a multi talemted performer and we enjoyed every minute with you.
You did it, my friend. You lived a full and complete life. It's a pity that we have only one to life to accomplish it.
rest in peace, dear Harry..  i loved you
Powerful ..... on the same level as Johnny Cash cover of Hurt... RIP.
Man, the Red-Headed Stranger himself has to be crying right now.....

Dear Friends... This man has passed on like we all will very shortly.  He will likely be remembered by many for his God given talent.  His passing should make us reflect all the more on our own short mortality.  The rate of death I am told is 100%  We could die at any time and from anything a virus, cancer, heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, age, stress you name it.\n\nHave you ever stopped to really think about how little time you may have left on this planet?  I mean really let it sink in and think about it.  Friend..Do you know absolutely sure 100% if you died today where you would go?\n\nThere is a real place called heaven, and one called hell.   Hell is said to be eternal torment and separation from God, where there is no more hope ever.  Likely a most horrid place you wouldn't want any one to go for 5 minutes let alone trillions upon trillions of years...forever.  \nSee here; \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5gv-V9axtg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLOAUB9Vjo0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vywj182oFw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDsn5v4pdgY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmp3UNjeu0k\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15k-1V2gx6I\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2G6yFeWmw8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYAVkuNk8pU\n\nFortunately God desires all to come be with him forever and it is an awesome place beyond description forever and ever...\nTo make this possible Jesus came to pay for our punishment our sin, our destination without God, and to bring us home to the most awesome, loving inconceivable place for all eternity. But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.\n\nAlso all of us have done wrong things and broken laws that God gave us.  Don't worry you don't get to heaven by being a good person.  And there aren't many different paths to heaven.  Fortunately there is a way that everyone who has done bad things can change and go to heaven forever and ever.  God said there is only one way to heaven..not many paths and fortunately we don't get there by being a good person\n\nIn John 14:6 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. Nobody goes to heaven without Jesus.  Plain and simple that is how we go to heaven.  Not by being good, or following many different paths...it comes down to Jesus and Jesus alone.  What is required?  Well we learn that what is required is to repent of our wrong doings, and believe on the Jesus, and endure to the end of our lives continuing in our faith in Jesus.\n\nIt all comes down to this...will you Believe on and Trust Jesus today.  Change your eternal destiny right now be laying your trust in the only thing that can save us and fill the void in our hearts. Jesus Christ.\n\nWill you trust on him Before its too late!\n\nYou will all meet him VERY Soon whether in this life or the soon coming afterlife!\n\nWill you put your trust in him right now friend?\n\nPlease let this settle in deeply.  When you draw your last breath that God gives you, which could happen any moment.  In that moment you draw your last breath...the only thing that will matter is What YOU did with Jesus in this life....nothing else at all in that moment will matter..nothing else (everything but that is temporary and fading).  What you did with Jesus in this life will be the ONLY thing left that will matter in the moment you draw your final breath.  You cannot at this time begin to conceive just how important this message is.  I pray that you will take heed to it while their is still a short time for you to do so, and it is everlastingly too late for you.  Please friends do not ignore or delay in this serious message about turning to Jesus right now, and truly following him the rest of your days. \n\nHas anyone ever told you that: GOD LOVES YOU & has a wonderful plan for your life?\nI have a real quick but important question to ask you... If you died tonight, would you go to heaven?\n\nMuch Love to You\n\n(If you found value in this message please share this crucial message of hope with as many people as possible).\n\nhttp://howtofollowjesus.net\nhttp://embarktoheaven.info
He still has a presence
Lovely.  I used to know Dean.
Mashed me up ♥
Like it:)
Rest in peace
Rest in peace Harry Dean Stanton.
Just heard he passed, this was the first film I ever saw him in and he introduced me to this amazing song, travel well brother x
Now you're there buddy, now you're there.
I remember a couple of years ago rewinding this part over a few times because he sang this so sweet. You could tell he'd lived some life. RIP.
Rest now. You're in the grace of glory forever more. R.I.P Harry Dean Stanton. 1926-2017
Rest in peace and with the lord near
Harry Dean Stanton is the best - under appreciated actor of all time! Hands down, unless you count 'leading' actors.
R.I.P. Harry Dean Stanton.
R.I.P., HDS.
RIP Harry Dean
Stanton died today. 15 September, 2017.
Just a closer walk with thee, Mr Stanton,- rest in peace.
RIP...Ah was just watching Partly Fiction last night and remarked- There's the Last of a Certain Breed of Men.......Probably the last Hollywood veteran of WWII.
this is so saf
Harry Dean Stanton passed away today. The last movie I remember him in was The Last Stand with Arnold Schwarzenegger. We have a countless number of films he played in to remember him by. Christine, Repo Man,  Paris Texas, Dillenger, Two Lane Blacktop, Fire Down Below, and the list goes on and on. R.I.P. Mr. Stanton. You will be missed.
Safe travels Harry.
RIP Harry
RIP Harry Dean Stanton
Rip
R.I.P. Harry!
RIP Harry.
He performs it, just like the old blues legends, very great !
how much homosexy did they do in this movie?
Handful o' legends
I was watching youtube videos the other night, and got caught in the mode where you keep getting suggested videos to watch. I passed on most, but wound up watching this, as Cool Hand Luke is one of my all time favorite movies, and I've always loved Harry Dean Stanton. Kind of surreal to me that the next day after watching this, he had passed on. If you've ever compiled a list of your favorite top 10 or 20 movies, there's a pretty good chance Harry acted in one or more of those movies.
A solid actor. Multitalented. Unforgetable in any scene. Job well done Sir.

That Paul Newman didn't win the Academy Award for best actor in this movie is a joke. Paul Scofield, A Man for All Seasons was great, but Luke is an iconic film character creation.
R.I.P. Harry Dean Stanton. Just saw him in the new Twin Peaks

Rest in peace, Harry.
Dear Friends... This man has passed on like we all will very shortly.  He will likely be remembered by many for his God given talent.  His passing should make us reflect all the more on our own short mortality.  The rate of death I am told is 100%  We could die at any time and from anything a virus, cancer, heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, age, stress you name it.\n\nHave you ever stopped to really think about how little time you may have left on this planet?  I mean really let it sink in and think about it.  Friend..Do you know absolutely sure 100% if you died today where you would go?\n\nThere is a real place called heaven, and one called hell.   Hell is said to be eternal torment and separation from God, where there is no more hope ever.  Likely a most horrid place you wouldn't want any one to go for 5 minutes let alone trillions upon trillions of years...forever.  \nSee here; \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5gv-V9axtg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLOAUB9Vjo0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vywj182oFw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDsn5v4pdgY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmp3UNjeu0k\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15k-1V2gx6I\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2G6yFeWmw8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYAVkuNk8pU\n\nFortunately God desires all to come be with him forever and it is an awesome place beyond description forever and ever...\nTo make this possible Jesus came to pay for our punishment our sin, our destination without God, and to bring us home to the most awesome, loving inconceivable place for all eternity. But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.\n\nAlso all of us have done wrong things and broken laws that God gave us.  Don't worry you don't get to heaven by being a good person.  And there aren't many different paths to heaven.  Fortunately there is a way that everyone who has done bad things can change and go to heaven forever and ever.  God said there is only one way to heaven..not many paths and fortunately we don't get there by being a good person\n\nIn John 14:6 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. Nobody goes to heaven without Jesus.  Plain and simple that is how we go to heaven.  Not by being good, or following many different paths...it comes down to Jesus and Jesus alone.  What is required?  Well we learn that what is required is to repent of our wrong doings, and believe on the Jesus, and endure to the end of our lives continuing in our faith in Jesus.\n\nIt all comes down to this...will you Believe on and Trust Jesus today.  Change your eternal destiny right now be laying your trust in the only thing that can save us and fill the void in our hearts. Jesus Christ.\n\nWill you trust on him Before its too late!\n\nYou will all meet him VERY Soon whether in this life or the soon coming afterlife!\n\nWill you put your trust in him right now friend?\n\nPlease let this settle in deeply.  When you draw your last breath that God gives you, which could happen any moment.  In that moment you draw your last breath...the only thing that will matter is What YOU did with Jesus in this life....nothing else at all in that moment will matter..nothing else (everything but that is temporary and fading).  What you did with Jesus in this life will be the ONLY thing left that will matter in the moment you draw your final breath.  You cannot at this time begin to conceive just how important this message is.  I pray that you will take heed to it while their is still a short time for you to do so, and it is everlastingly too late for you.  Please friends do not ignore or delay in this serious message about turning to Jesus right now, and truly following him the rest of your days. \n\nHas anyone ever told you that: GOD LOVES YOU & has a wonderful plan for your life?\nI have a real quick but important question to ask you... If you died tonight, would you go to heaven?\n\nMuch Love to You\n\n(If you found value in this message please share this crucial message of hope with as many people as possible).\n\nhttp://howtofollowjesus.net\nhttp://embarktoheaven.info
I love this man. RIP\nHarry Dean.  When I\nfeel real down, this tune sung\nand strummed by him always \nsoothes me.
Rest in peace Harry one of my heroes . Thank you
This movie was like Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea. Both protagonists and stories seem like everyday scenes, the everyman trying to resist and overcome far greater and malevolent forces. Then you realise these are spiritual works of art. It isn't by chance that HDS is playing spirituals while they are trying to break Luke's spirit out there by the ditch, or here, saying goodbye to his mother. Quite a sad scene!
Such a great movie
If I fall dear lord who cares?
His latest performances on showtime Sundays at 9:00 p.m.,on the return of Twin  Peaks He plays the guitar there once or twice as well
do u kiddies even realize how big a legend this movie and HDS is????
RIP.
Rip good sir
Rip Mr. Stanton

Peace HDS..\n.you will be missed..
We will miss him dearly. RIP

RIP Harry 😪
The best version of this song I ever heard is by the chambers bros.i,ve heard hundreds of versions.the bros do a fantastic job.great !!!!!!
🌈R.I.P. 🌈🗿🎸🎤🌵🌄🙌🎪💔*
Memorable song,  part of such a great movie, as its my personal favorite and quite possibly Newman's finest hour and his personal choice i do believe ? Harry Dean Stanton and his contribution is to his credit, RIP Harry
It just creeps up on you, powerful.
Why isn't this song part of the soundtrack? did mr.stanton ever record this song?
he croaked today, rip!
I wish Harry had recorded a full version of this.
Damn that is so great.
That brother is feeling it.  I can't sing or even listen to this tune without feeling it.
Harry's version is definitely best - wish he'd done the whole thing. Try Judith Durham - seekers for one that comes close.
pure class, from writing to music to acting, simple yet so deep
Man.......this movie. I think Paul Newmans best......ever. And he made so many that were over the top.
The closest to this I can find is by Judith Durham - wish Harry had done a full version but Judith's is excellent.
:(. ..
Comes a time the bitch don't recognize the pups no more...  -Harold Dean Stanton,... Last one standing might be appropriate after witnessing the sendoff they gave Dennis. Tough Motherfuckers to be sure. I met Harry Dean in '89 at the original Hollywood Billiards-(the brick building that fell in during the Northridge quake). I'd met some people already and was on the move in L.A. Some friends that ran the original Zero Club-(Wayzatta Cameroon-Mark Boyd and brother Scotty Boyd-great man/guitarista). We showed up to HB and walking in found Harold Dean holding court in a booth and completely lit, and blathering coherently. I was introduced and realized that this was the wrong time for such 'protocol'. He said-Nice to meet you Dave and that was my first big movie star encounter in Los Angeles. You would have had to have been there. series of true and actual events in the City of Angels. This being one of the least of them. Great singer, and pure American talent-\nHarry Dean Stanton. Not since that dog put his tongue on the butter. -Greatest role ever- Missouri Breaks.
now get ain't no grave...
Two Amazing Queens 😘. Can't stop listening to this song!!! ❤️💛💚💙💜
I've just discovered your music and now I'm hooked.... witchcraft certainly.

LMAO at first i thought it was lately, been thinkin maybe, the beatles saved me from all of my friends
Mitchy looks real stressed out in that thumbnail
2:20 When your face actually distorts after eating a brownie, you know it wasn't just any brownie... lol
If you play it at 1.25x speed it sounds even more like a clubbing song!
One of my favorites. This is what I dance to @ 6 a.m. in the morning ehdn I need to be getting ready for school 😂🤦‍♀️😍😍🔥
How are you feeling?\nMe: FUCKED UP AND LIT

I would never let Mitch into my party, he looks like such a creep here lol
Ya'll are such adorable dorms
Harry Dean Stanton, genius character actor who broke through to the lead role in Paris Texas
RIP Harry Dean Stanton, One of the best actors ever.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton! \nOne of the best :(
Just saw this movie for the first time. If I knew how good it was, I would've watched it a long time ago.
R.I.P. Harry Dean Stanton.
A character actor who often outshined the star actors. Without Harry Dean Stanton Repo Man wouldn't be as memorable. RIP
0:16  My drive to work
RIP Harry Dean\nyou made this movie so great
RIP Harry Dean Stanton. You attained Legend Status. Good on you.
Cool Hand Luke  Kellys Heros any movie Harry was in was better for havin him in it . .  .RIP Harry
When I was a kid--- AKA adolescent punk wannabe in the '80s--- I wanted to be the old guy.\nI'm middle-aged now (a bad look for a punk), and I still do.\nNo character actor ever OWNED a movie like Harry Dean Stanton. Rest in peace, hangdog; see ya in the Big Parking Lot in the Sky....
Rest in Peace, Mr. Stanton.  :*(
RIP Harry Dean Stanton. Life of a repo man is always intense.
Rest in peace, Harry Dean Stanton!
I was in college saw this movie almost every day \nHDS-RIP
You find one in every car,,,
RIP Harry!
Just adding my remembrance of Harry Dean Stanton in this essential clip for him from the movie we should thank him most for making, the most GenX cult film, one of the most essential films of the 1980s, and one of the best cinematic depictions of LA ever.\n\nAlways in small roles in so many '80s films that I enjoyed or remembered when I was young. Always added to those films in some way, as the late Roger Ebert noted, even if there wasn't much to add to.\n\nI was pleased to read that he actually kept at it until his death ... I hadn't seen anything with him in it since Anger Management and almost didn't recognize him there because of the makeup (but his voice was one of a kind).\n\nIf you want to see him in a more central role, to see him really show his range, I heartily recommend Paris, Texas. Long but good, from an actor's standpoint.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton
Harry Dean Stanton was one badass actor!  Godspeed brother!
later days harry.......
Rip Mr Stanton
RIP Harry Dean Stanton.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton
1:07 code , 1:43 tense situations ,
Damn a lot of comments. Shame people have to die for their work to be recognized......
RIP...he lived by the Actor's Code
Yet, despite his disheveled appearance, you get the sense that Bud has a compassionate side to him and, deep-down, he wants to do something meaningful with his life. So he tries teaching Otto all about the repo man trade as fast as possible and, later, dies while trying to get the box. And even Otto comes around to feeling a kinship with Bud at the end by pleading with him, Only an asshole gets killed for a car! This is what makes 'Repo Man' such a great movie--the characters are interesting and you care what happens to them.
Only an a$$hole gets killed for a car
RIP HDS
RIP  Harry Dean Stanton
RIP Harry.  Your greatest role ever IMHO
RIP HDS
RIP BUD!
Saint Harry
RIP Harry Dean Stanton.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton
RIP HDS
RIP, Harry Dean.
R.I.P. Bud
RIP HARRY.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton \n\nProper legend
R.I.P. Harry Dean Stanton.
R.I.P. Harry Dean Stanton...
Ordinary fuckin' people. I hate 'em.
love this film, every teen should see it
1:34 Hey. Look at that. Look at those assholes over there. Ordinary fuckin' people. I hate'm.
Suddenly, Auto gets interested when his mentor mentions the consumption of speed as one of the perks to his new job!
Harry Dean Rulz
Have a nice day\nNight\nNight, day, it doesn't mean shit to me
Come on dickhead!
this film is incredible!  it's a monster mix of laughs and humor
Otto.. he seems to rise above his friends, who are going in the other direction, committing acts of armed robbery.. Repoman, has a code.
Now humans do not have to snort the powder, they only need prescriptions from the medical industries.
I could go for a couple cans of drink right about now.
Harry is such a machine.  Repo Man is a cult classic and that is great dialouge but his delivery makes it even better.
1:35 Ordinary People.....
Speed huh??
Ordinary fuckin' people - I hate 'em.
'movieclips' just for when you thought life had ripped you off enough
Tense situations, kid....
The subtitles on your clips are extremely annoying.
this movie is about farting in a market
THats asimov
Wait...... Nicole the blush, baby noooooo..... The eyebrows🙀.... But I'm super excited to see your new Halloween looks!👌🏼
This reminded me of Kate Walsh. Idk why. Really pretty
You're a FOX, right from the box...the makeup is miraculous...ya wake up before 8 every day, I'll bet!
Awesome video! Do you have lipstick on your teeth at the end? :)
the blush ruined the whole look but I love the eyes and lips
Did she start stretching her ears? Because if she did thats bomb af.
I love you more than life but this background drove me crazy because it was so close to your skin color 😭
I'm not a vlog person so I'm glad you're back with your good ol' makeup tutorials! AND I LIVE FOR YOUR HALLOWEEN TUTORIALS I'M SO EXCITED.
Glad you guys are good!! I love about and 1hr 49 minutes north of you we lost power thatsunday night @9 and currently are still without it.
You got super lucky. I live here too. It wasn't that it was a cat 2. It's because when it hit Naples Irma decided to head towards Orlando instead of Tampa. If it didn't turn we would really be hurting. I feel very lucky too.
Girl I grew my brows out from the end of March to the end of August lmao YOU CAN DO IT
Since you love music you should check out my bros band IN REAL LIFE ! They just released their music video for EYES CLOSED in Times Square
I missed your makeup videos soooo much
can u please, do a unicorn halloween theme. PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The blush is too much for me and emphasises the texture and the eyebrows are way too dark. The overall look is giving me Maleficent vibes for some reason.
I feel like people talk alot about them hoping the hurricame didnt hit them but then it did but not too bad. Like come on..when you are hoping it didnt come your way..it was moving through some.other area and destroyed people's lives. India and parts of africa was under water...waist high but yall out here wishing it didnt hit yall but not caring who it did hit. Smh.
I love u and u always look bomb but mama - those earrings... no boo boo- just no haha
Here's a little tip - if you want to test different makeup brands but don't have the money to purchase all the products then ==gaip.club== is giving away complimentary sample bundles. I got mine 3 weeks ago with no hassle.
I swear, my loyalty to Nicole will never change.
😍😍😍😍
Am I the only one who HATES the Shape Tape concealer? 😩
When you lost power for 5 days and you couldn't see Nicole's new video and just remembered you missed it! This made my day lol
You're looking good girl 💁🏻so excited for the Halloween videos 🙌🏻
I love it Can't wait for Halloween I'm so excited to see what you have for us
You look genuinely happy and you are just glowing!
Love it!
The eyebrows 😐
Giving me Nicole 2013 viiibesssss!!!
I like your brows girl!!!!
Happy that y'all are safe!! Love love love your dark hair and this eye look!!
Lol you got a little lipstick on your tooth momma 😘 beautiful look regardless
Are you putting anything on your brows to grow them out?  I want  to grow mine out but naturally they'll take forever 😭 love you girl
This looks like the one you did years ago. I still love that video
Yes girl you need to keep those brows under control lol...
Loved this!!  Does anyone know what brush she used for her under-eye concealer?  I can't tell but I WANT IT.  Thanks in advance!
are we not gonna talk about your bedazzled teeth?? I love it😂😂😂
I love love SAVAGE!! You look stunning like always!
Honestly, I forgot about you when this notification popped up. Be more present, girl!
Ahhh so beautiful as always so glad you're safe
Beautiful

Wow, I really hate all make-up!
Glad y'all are safe 🙏💞
Missed watching your videos! Literally what I look forward too every time I see your gna post a video ♥️♥️♥️ we love you!!!
Love this look! Glad you're safe from storm.
Happy to hear that you guys are safe! It's crazy how badly it affected some people! Donations are definitely a good idea. Also, miss your vlogs so much!!!!
Nicole could make a video of her farting and it would get over 300,000 views! Lol 🙌🏼 love you Nicole
Jesus, its a face not coloring book.
I miss this kind of videos from you honey!! Keep them coming 🙌🏼🙏🏼
i will never get tired of you you one of the OGsss 143 xoxo mari <3 add me on sc!! vibesswmaarii
u got alittle of lip stick on your teeth....I love u....
I absolutely love you and think you're gorgeous. This look is beautiful, but I think maybe you used a bit too much shape tape. You looked very white on the center of your face and it made the rest of your face look quite yellow. Again, I think it's beautiful! XOXO
I was stuck in Tampa and I was pretty scared. We got a hole in our roof too. Aghhhh but I'm so glad you're safe!
it took me a minute to understand those earrings.
People's nails.
Love it girl👍🏼
Wow great look!

💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Glad you are ok but prayers continued for those impacted. Love the video.
Your nose looks huge when you highlight it like you do. It doesn't look natural..
This look just makes your brown eyes pop😍 Love this look babe! You should give the Too Faced loose powder a try, I actually like it better than my Laura mercier now ..
You are sweet and very talented, but I will not get close to Benefit as the brand is promoting that other person...
I was looking through the comments in the beginning saying too much blush and was thinking dang sis couldn't have made it that bad but when I got to that part.... it's bad :(
Girl that stone on your thooth tho... Sooo weird. Hope that trend never comes back.
Soooo Sooooo Happy that you and your family are Good.
I live near Nicole and I lost power for 3 days and didn't get wifi and cable for 6 days but thank god everyone in our area are okay 😌
Love the eyes but the blush threw off this look way off 😬❤️
Tell us the story about this diamond tooth!!!!
are those halloween nails, or do they always look like that?
I'm so glad you're all safe! I was so worried and glad to have your videos back!😭💜
Also from Florida and can relate to the emotions you have after this storm. We were out of power for almost 5 days. Glad you are safe! 💜
Is water not drinkable out of a tap in America orrrr? 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
Smoked by a hurricane? ...just the worst way to put devastation I've ever heard is all.
Can't wait for your halloween Tutorials 😍
Thumbnail looks photoshopped...dislike
I just love the human you are and your funny vibes you throw out there for everyone to see!!!!! Keep being you sweetie and GOD BLESS!!!!

Who else thought it was tessa brooks.??
Since when did you stop the 143. thing on her video description Nicole? 😞 you don't even say I love you guys anymore. Sad times. I haven't watched your videos in ages! Glad to have done today though.
Nicole you are one of my favorite youtubers but i have to say i didn't like your eyeshadow in this one looks kinda muddy you were saying a little at a time but i felt like you were really dipping your brush in the shadows girl... 143 #snapfam
I love these Vampy tutorials! \n\nIf anyone is interested I actually posted my own Vampy Fall Makeup Tutorial using all affordable products. Feel free to check it out if you'd like, or not :)
You're the queen of Halloween and I'm so excited even tho we do not celebrate it in my country .
No time to fix the mic clipping at all in post, huh?
I would keep all the box art and frame it, but that's just me...
When I was a kid, I thought the Galaxy Explorer kit was huge. Sheesh.
Is Simone not part of the tested team?
As steep as the $800 price tag is.... Ah ha ha ha ha, stop complaining about that. That works out to be about $1100NZD but our retail price is $1500NZD!!! So stop complaining about the price in the US. You guys got it so good!
11 hours so what 60+ man hours which brings it down to 10-15 bucks an hour-ish. Well that's a shit load of value right there for entertainment! Love it - better to beg for forgiveness, than ask for permission oh wifey! I have some neeewws...
ONly $800, for that much you could just buy a 3d printer and print it yourself.\n\nCorrection, at around 10kg you  could buy a 3d printer, print it yourself and still have a couple hundred left over.
Although I hate this particular portmanteau, the set is an instant toygasm!
$800?No so dumb
nice
Nerds! lol
I don't want one. I want to just build one
At 1:05 Adam mistook the set number for the piece count and at 8:51 he referred to lego bricks as legos. Not trying to be a douche just making an observation.
Please give one of these sets to a fan. I really enjoy legos but its really expensive, especially when living as a student. I havent bren able to build any new sets simply because I can't afford it.
The previous model was about £160. It's the best dolls house and I  only dropped it twice
$1300 In Australia - Just Crazy!
So 12 hours for your team. So for me as a solo builder what should i expect? 12 hours times 8 ppl = 96 work hours?
Adam, you broke my heart when you said Legos :-(
now see I want this... but my wallet doesn't
What the hell is an aluminium falcon?
Imagine if your friends drop it
They really didn't put seats in the cockpit?? The one single location in the ship that unquestionably has the most screentime... and they didn't bother to furnish it, or make it large enough to hold the seated figures properly? For $800. Maybe in another ten years they'll figure that part out; I'll just hold my breath until then.
just think of all the interesting conversations you had!
You can kinda tell that Norm is a straight up AFOL, the others are just cool, Lego! (Besides the Bricknerd guy)
Guys, the audio mix on this is atrocious. If you're going to do more multi-mic pieces like this then you need to get it properly edited and mixed, the audio is really bad for a channel of your stature.
Who here hates the fact that they took all the bags, took all the pieces out and then sorted it, not just going by the bags, and tore up the instructions
What a piece of junk! - Luke Skywalker\n\nThat is the most beautiful LEGO set I've ever seen. What an awesome team build, how long would a solo build take...
How did you get this early
Nice .  but what piss me off a person like me could NEVER HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT. Im a working man ...sometime it make sick only rich people can have stuff like that
Next to the Lego porsche 911, this is one of my favorite sets. It's so detailed
wanted the old one since a child...
How does lego design these as in how would the blocks go to build it
So how long does it take to build if your alone :OOOO
Is it in true scale to the LEGO figures? (haven't seen the video yet)
Oh, my goodness. It was a sudden release. How do they sell like this? When is the next official release date? I've known it is Oct. 1`.
12 hours for 6 people. I can only imagine how long it would take for 1. I feel like im watching a review of a sports car. Wish I had it but no way can I afford it
I was half anticipating them to throw it against the wall once they finished
if you cant play with it i aint gonna buy it, same rule for cosplay. Display pieces are nice but i am not wasting that amount of money for it to sit on a shelf
this box set is madness
At least the right size to the figures :)
Will swap kidney for this Lego set or sell my soul...
That's not proper Lego, just a slot together kit!
We have no idea what's inside this box\nYes you do, Norm, stop being so dramatic.
So cool to see that Adam and Grant are the only two who survived the Mythbusters breakup and now have a youtube channel together! Thumbs up!
I would set it on a shelf with the panels on half of the ship to appear to be peeling back by hanging them on fishing string
I WANT THAT THING SOOOOOO BADLY\n GOSH WHY IS IT 800DOLLARS ARGH
A lovely set guys, here in New Zealand we pay $1500NZD which bites.
They wasted half their time to knolling. Good to know.
I like the new one except its cockpit which looks odd and out of place
How many are going to be made
One of my coworkers is planning to buy it. I guess he will have a lot of fun building this little wonder ^^
Like every other set,it's a box of plastic bricks.
Please start putting where everyone in the video got their graphic T's from as they all have great taste.
Kishore we have the same name! And I am kisure about that haha
Missed opportunity for a epic quote at 10:53
i built this set in 7 hours
I can't stand what's he's name....
For Christmas what should I get this or the Death Star
I'd just like to say I noticed and appreciated the camera motion during the time lapse
As a guy who's not into Lego, but really into the falcon, I can say that the old one has a much better shape. The new one is way too flat and the cockpit and radar dish look too small.\n\n\nNow Adam, it is time to build and review the bandai perfect grade falcon!!!!
Wow, great video!  Any estimates on how long it would take one or two people to build this?
800 smackers. might take a month to build so it's great intertainment.  Sucks you can't pick it up
Adam shouldn't throw the box and stickers around like they're worthless
Where would you even put something like that? its too big for a shelf
Death to Chihuahua’s!!!
Cool
These are over $1000 on Ebay Australia lol. At first I was like looks meh as I'm not a huge fan of Lego but this was pretty amazing. What really stands out to me is how stringent Lego's quality control must be to get every single piece into this set (maybe they ship spare pieces in it?). But damn that was crazy!
Why are you wearing a hat indoors?
Go subscribe to https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCjmXfvtQbyzUtdEYpjGX46w for secrets Legos and more
When he said tons of minifigs 😂
Lego produced 20,000 sets, twice as many as 10179's 10,000. 75192 has sold out Lego's entire worldwide stock on 14th September's first day of launch just to VIP members only😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
the guy in the pong shirt. i swear, he looks like Alex Lifeson
The old one is better.\nThey just want to sell lego
Just wait for Lepin to make their knockoff and get it for $200 instead lol
transmission lend alone oyyhhg wonder away lead straight firm nut.
Simone though
Lol box is fuked now

Hey Tested and the Tested Team, Good day to you. BIG FAN! WOW! LEGO Ultimate Collectors Series Millennium Falcon (2017) Review! was SUPER AWESOME. Excellent Job and Fantastic Build! Congratulations complete Fast Build. You ALL ROCK! Thank you for sharing your time, talents, skill, fun ideas, and Wonderful creative videos. Take care, keep on doing what you love to do, and have a great day. Peace & Joy. Back to more videos :P Super Fun Stuff! 5,000 like yeah! lol
If this is a newer Falcon, shouldn't it have the rectangular radar dish that it featured in The Force Awakens?  (I realize that the photo on the box depicts it flying through the skies of Bespin, however that model doesn't differ much - if at all - from it's predecessor featured on the table next to the build.)
Old one looks better imo
Most will buy and never open it, investment
lol they sing drunk
that is a tribute to the everly brothers - everybody knows and loves that song......
a few scorched notes but so nice; I used to know Dean.
What happened to Hollywood?   lol
nice, bob dylan in the background chewing some gum.
Harry Dean Stanton the best
I love this!
God bless Phil Everly and what a beautiful way to remember him - except playing the original records, of course...
Priceless!

Que Sera Del Reggaeton Cuando Daddy Yankee Se Retire? :(
I have a Burt's bees bb cream & its stinky at first from Noni fruit.
I saved this one to watch  til now because it was the last one lol so sad it's over 😣
Thank you so much Taylor for your research! All your vids are short, simple and informative. Hope you are having an awesome time in London! Be safe!
You are always beautiful!!  This foundation looked like it yellowed there at the end, as well as was very thick. Took a while to oxidize! Thanks for the great information on all your videos!!  @~}~~~~
I really wish you would do an all time top favorite foundation video!  I have pretty much the same skin for and I want to find my holy grail foundations! Love this series it helps me a ton!
I don't think you have a video on 💄kokie skin perfect hd $12.98💄can you please try it 😘
Can you do a video of your all time favorite primers and the foundation that pair really well with them? I used urban decay primer with makeup forever foundation and it came out super patchy and it looked horrible :(
This time went by too quickly! For some reason I thought this was day 14 and was so confused when day 15 never came 😂
I found your channel through this series! hey!
I feel bad when you get a foundation you don’t like. I always feel crusty and weird when I try a foundation that doesn’t work for my skin lol. Love your reviews btw❣️
I think you can try the bareminerals remedy powder foundation or tom ford powder foundation
By far my favorite YouTuber 👌🏻❤️
Love ur videos! \nWas wondering if u could do a video of ur fav top 5 or 10 foundations overall, of everyone u have tryed. Also I was wondering if u had any recommendations on a YouTube channel that is like urs only for more acne/dry skin?
My I give a suggestion, next time you do 15 days of foundation, don't do such a long intro. I want to see you put the foundation on sooner!!! Love you!!!
I stumbled upon your channel last week and since then I've been binge watching 15 days of foundation. I've already watched through TWO seasons. LOL sooooo good. Also I've purchased THREE foundations already based on the videos. Which is NOT good for my wallet. but I'm super excited to get these foundations and try them!!
Thanks for the video!!! I love your reviews!!!
Super glad I found you! Your energy matches my own and tho I don't have ache I do have what is called milia so it makes my skin super textured and it's left me pretty self conscious but your videos kinda taught me that yeah, I can work with it tho it helps alot <3 love and good vibes to you!
I feel like I cannot buy a foundation without watching Taylor review it first. I haven't found many other youtubers with pale/problem skin just like me.
One of my biggest problems with oily skin is transfer... do you think you could show how each foundation transfers? Even if it's showing your phone after putting it up to your face lol thanks!
Hey Taylor! Long time baerrito here yet it's my first time actually commenting and requesting for a review haha 😂\n\nMay you please review the new It Cosmetics lineup of products in like a foundation friday or a first impressions video 😊\nEspecially the full coverage+skincare from the Bye Bye Redness and Bye Bye Breakout lines\nSeems like they'll be good for sensitive and pimple prone skin 👌🏻\n\nThank you so much and thank you for all the hard work you put in your videos! Really enjoyed this season of 15 days of foundation 💕\nSending love from the Philippines 😍🇵🇭
Thank you for all your hard work. Have a great trip!!
Loved the series. Keep up the good work
Omg i just saw this at the store and almost bought but it is expensive for a drug store foundation, $15.99 here at my local Walmart. So glad u are reviewing this!!!
Nooooooo!!!! It's over😩😩😩
Do you like any foundations?! Lol
You look like a female version of Ronnie from Falling in reverse
What foundations do you recommend for really dry skin? I have dry patches on my cheeks😞😞😞
Please do a review of the glossier foundation!
I was on Sephora looking at UFO Sunday Riley Oil because I had gotten a sample and liked it.  The video suggested to mix a bit with your foundation for those with acne. Ever tried U.F.O products?
Do you think you could start including a drugstore foundation or two in the comparison swatches? Just for people who stick to drugstore makeup. Back when you included Maybelline Matte + Poreless in 110 it was useful. Revlon Colorstay in Buff would also be a good comparison that lots of people know. Thanks, loved this round of 15 shades of foundation!
I'm new! Saw you on trending! Will definitely watch the rest of this series
Can't wait for the wrap up video now that 15DOF is over. Not going to lie. I'll probably buy whatever your top 2 are 😂❤❤ #snapchatfam
I can totally hear the sponge pats on your face this time, it's highly amusing XD
Taylor, I've noticed that when you do your swatches you pause for a couple extra seconds at the end-- and I LOVE THAT!! Thank you for doing that!! It gives me that extra second to look and compare! 👍🏻 I love FDOF but holy shitzees, I can't wait for a shadow and shmooze!! 🌯💙 #baerittos #snapchatfam
You look ill with all the make-up
Please try marcelle makeup! There's not many reviews on it and I really love the brand for the most part!
Please do a review on... \nCLINIQUE Even Better™ Glow Light Reflecting Makeup Broad Spectrum SPF 15
Found you through the series and definitely gonna stick around ! :) :)
what are you 5 top/favorite foundations? Thank you
Where's the wrap up video? I need to know what I need to go buy!!
I watch so much Taylor that when I got a sample of the FAB intense hydration cream I was like oh perfect ill put it on the dry patch on my forehead a started to and then realized that I dont have a dry patch on my forehead?????? whoops
So depressed that you won't be making my day better everyday😭😭
This foundation has looked terrible  in many of the reviews I have watched. I will definitely be passing on this one.
So sad it's over!!!
I tried the burts bees bb cream and it was awful. It made my skin look terrible and it had a heavy floral scent, I think all burts bees products have some sort of scent to them which is kind of annoying.
Whoah, nice, this video is trending!  I'm so happy your channel is really taking off!  Yaaaay!  Also, thank you for another super awesome !5 days of foundation.  Looked forward to every single video and loved them all.  Thank you, thataylaa!
Have you tried the Dior Forever Perfect Makeup Fluid Floundation?
GIRL YOU MADE IT TO TRENDING!!!!! CONGRATULATIONSSSS! Btw love 15DOF!!!
I have never bought a Burts Bees product. Ty
The best one IMO opinion was the Two Faced comfort matte foundation it looked super smooth and nice, and I'm going to pick it up!!!
I don't want it to be over 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🌯🌯🌯🌯🌯
The Baerritos always seem to be awesome!  Love the positivity!! And welcome all the new Baerritos (Taylor looks like you picked up a lot of new fam along this series)
You should do a full face using makeup from Wish! Or do a review on Makeup brushes from Wish! (Only the products that are Wish Verified, though!)
I got deported from London :/
I'm just so thankful for this series. I have a really hard time finding a good foundation for my skin type and colour since I have really bad texture and I'm extremely pale, so thank you soooo much :)
At the end the foundation makes her face look a completely different color than the rest of her body...
I'm a new burrito! Love your videos!
My first time watching your 15 days of foundation series and I loved it! Cant wait for the next one.
Taylor I'm sure you probably already know this but I wanted to comment just incase any of your subscribers didn't know that Milani now has a very pale shade porcelain . It's too matte for my dry maturing skin but I think so many younger ladies with oily skin would love it. It's full coverage and only $8-$10.
I found you through this series. I love that you're so honest and I have been binging your videos lately!
YOU MADE IT TO THE TRENDING PAGE !!!!!!!!!!!!!
can you do a video comparing all the stick foundations you have tried?
I am brand new to your channel I am now binge watching
I mixed this foundation with Urban Decay was surprised how well it looked, I wore all day & had no problems, I have dry skin.
She looks like she could be Snow White.
GIRL! way to go! Your on the trending page!! ❤
Dermacol full coverage foundation found mine on Amazon for around $16 really would like your opinion
You're trennnndingggg! #33, POW! You're the best!
Get it girl, you're trending! Your hard work totally deserves it.
I know you probably get a ton of acne questions and/or comments but here is another one.  Do you have any health issues, such as pain, fatigue, digestion problems?  I ask because I have those types of issues and adult acne.  I believe it is all connected to pancreas and gallbladder issues.
Your eye makeup is on point! I love it!!
I am new to your chanel and so far i am loving your videos
So for my very first 15 days of foundation, I want to honestly say thank you for all you do and all of your hard work. This was for sure an amazing experience and very informative. Didn't want it to end at all lol
Hey girl, just wanted to say I love you to death and that your videos have been helping me cope with starting my life in college. I'm only a state away from home but it still sucks and sometimes the people here suck. Regardless, it always felt good to finish homework and reward myself by watching your newest video. 🖤🖤🌯🌯
i'd love to see some reviews on the boots no 7 foundations!  :)
*Go watch The Greatest Story Never Told if you want to know the truth.*
For a pink undertone foundation, its super yellow
So sad 15 days of foundation is over!!! Love you and you're videos though!
It's saying #18 on trending! 🤗
Just hoping someone check me out💯
Hey I found this channel from burts bees

Try the ulta mineral foundation. I'd love to see yu thoughts!
throwback to one of the best gmm episodes of all time
They continue to get a little bit more inappropriate every episode
Combining Pig and Anus into Panus was a mistake
Best Episode! Love it!
How to relieve stress: Induce an early onset of insanity.
Chase Wears The Same Socks As Me!
I talk to my self all the time with ideos oh and for my xhannel lol
Link: 7:53\nOh my crab!\nWhat the crab!\nWhat iszz thab!\n\n10:10\nWhat is that?\nWhatthepthepyhepthepidath?\n\n😂😂😂
Oh I talked to myself in third person all the time to tell myself off haha
I would try to swim
< this guy thinks if snake kissed link then link would have give link a heart attack.
I feel like Link is a constant victim and that Rhett and the entire crew are in on it but Link's simple innocence makes him want to go along like a little brother who wants to fit in.
you might be calm but everyone will think your crazy
NOPE!  \n\nNOPE! NOPE! NOPE! my skin was crawling as soon as i heard snake
All hail the serpent king.
I find snakes are beautiful creatures of nature, sure there are poisonous snakes, but hey!
I talk to myself anytime I'm on a roller coaster 😂😂
it really works i tried it when the hospital wouldnt call my family when i was freaking out over a test they made me have it was the only way i could calm down maybe just in my head but it worked for me i still wasnt happy but i got through it
Serpent King was SO brave!
Did I just get rick rolled
If you eat raw termites they taste like pineapples
Honestly I didn't enjoy seeing Link nearly scared to tears for my viewing pleasure :(
well, we definitely know Link wasn't faking any of his emotions
Throwback to the good old days
The snake handler Christina is adorable, I hope they have her back again
I... have conversations with myself-\nMe: I need to study for that test.\nMe: ya, you do.\nHeh-
Link is the Serpent King, Link can do anything!
can we get there heads closer *heart rate rises*
I'm watching Link in a snake tank, because I'm not Link. Duuuuuuuuude
It sounds like home the movie
So thats I start talking in 3rd person randomly when I'm frustrated? Huh. Cool it was like built in.
I always talk to myself in third person haha - I thought I was crazy
I would have been better to see the live recording of his heartbeat...
not sure if i just got rick rolled or not
Woah I need to try talking to myself as a third person whwn I stress
Thanks. Talking in 3rd person helped me a lot!
There's a difference between talking to yourself in 3rd person and just referring to yourself in 3rd person. Lol....
4:30\nI love the way Rhett said That's me. :DD
Good Mythical Morning has just lost its pizzazz. You guys are putting all of your effort into Good Mythical crew.
talking to yourself in third person?
You guys should do what's in the box
next video we do this with rhett
Hey Lizzie, I watched My Haunted House season 1 episode 1 and I recognized you in the episode...did you play Stacy and have you ever shared this appearance on the show? Love you guys by the way ❤
The spin the wheel of mythicality people sounded didnt sound monotone at all.
#qtmba I would just relax 😎🙃😏😏
Did I just get Rick rolled??!??!?!?!?!??!?!
I would not get near the snake
maybe snakes don't scare me much but i was surprised how terrified Link was. Go Get'em Serpent King
did you guys know about the picture next to the electric guitar it changes all the time
What do they use for the heart rate monitor? I want one for my YouTube videos
GMM are getting more inappropriate with every video...
My uncle talks in 3rd person to help with his social anxiety. I always thought it was weird, now I think it could actually help him a lot
I would be inside a building with a roof. So wouldn't float very high.
Link is happy there was only one snake
This is one of my favorite episodes now. 😂😂😂
One of the best shows/channels ever. Thank you all.
Sometimes I think this show is one big prank on Link.
Link is the Serpent King and Link is me
YOU CAN DO IT SERPENT KING! YOU CAN DO IT SERPENT KING!🐍👑
You feel so bad for Link, but admit it, we got our schadenfreude fix from watching his suffering. Love you guys!
I talk to myself when I run. It helps me keep going. Lol 😂
because they no longer make videos in Spanish. I watched your videos but only in Spanish. by the way this the traditional with Google translator:
I absolutely love the new intro
Y'all better make a serpent king t-shirt after this
#QTMBA I would fly to Hawaii with my mom or go to Japan with my cousin :T
rhett thinks link is going to be choked.
does it look to anyone else like Rhett is wearing a ton of makeup?
Now, for anyone curious about if the snake could kill him:\nwell, technically, yes, but no.
*T H E    L I N K S T E R*
Good singing  Rhett
Tris the Boa...my name is Tris and Im scared of snakes, ironic right?
i have never heard Link so many times in one episode lol
Do will it pillow
My boa his 6,8...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInches
Link thinks fish can breathe through there anuses -link 2017
I want an albino boa
crime The vid truly  sounds like pretty grjatmix   ..
Ring management exercise delicate fade significantly frankly
poor link #saveLink
#qtmba watch water float
Linkster
10:09 though
THIS ISNT AN AUCTION
Rhett thinks link is gonna be choked
Good mythical morning guys !
Hahahaha poor link. :3
Poor link
First!
Pg
The opening line!!  😂😂😂
We almost got rick rolled *phew*
:( no.
...eating...panus..? D:
This is Amazing.
Omg
Did someone say Link?
panus....
Rhett's hair looks like coloured string cheese \n😂😂😂
THIS IS THE FUNNIEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN
This reminds me of Gollum.
Put Nicki minaj in a crap repetitive song and it will get views. Nicki seems to be in every song that's being released at the moment. \n\nHow about make real music that's not about sex, girls, drugs, money and boasting. \nOnly here for Nicki.
Audience was all like 😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐
Skip to 1:55 ....  you're welcome
I miss the eminem days

Damn i thought nikki was black chyna at first....
I don't like her she be all over my man NAS LOL
I love Nickis lyrics on this song
Nicki looks so damn good. yo Gotti is a real life joke and nicki saved this performance... at 4:16 he looked so uncomfortable pulling down his shirt it reminded me of when you finish a talent show performance and you finally look at your mom but your mom gesturing for you to fix yourself. I feel bad for him.
pull up with that pink  ................  to race with chyna
That hype man needs to shut up ...
My Queen! I love Queen Nicki so much 🔥
She's going to look like a monster when she's older, she's like Frankenstein already

Wow!  I've never seen a young, African-American man grabbing his crotch while yelling elementary school vocabulary & rhymes with strippers dancing in the background.  So fresh!  So new!  So unique!  BET must be so proud to put out a new Entertaining genre of music for listeners!
Is this really happening
*IF ANY YOUTUBERS ARE WANTING TO GROW THEIR CHANNEL SUB ILL SUB BK I'M STARTING A STREETWEAR CLOTHING LINE WITH ALL HANDRAWN DESIGNS ✏🖼 AND ALL IM DOING IS TRYING TO GET MY NAME OUT THERE*

I think it's hard for rappers not to say bad words 😂😂😂
Bitch like me
This is embarrassingly terrible. What ever happened to good hip hop. Im 25 years old and only listen to music from minimum 20 years ago. Remember Run DMC, Rakim, Slick Rick, LL Cool Jay, Tribe called Quest, Biggie Smalls, Blackmoon, Wu tang, Mc Lyte, Krs one, Brand Nubian, Epmd. What is this garbage. Even Sir Mix Alot is better then this garbage. Hip hop is in crisis. This generation is garbage and the music is the reflection of the very fact. RIP good hip hop music.
Damn..\nNicki hot...
nicki minaj 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
She slayed
At 2:33 is nicki lip syncing? She moves the mic away and her vocals are still going and they don't sound like the backing vocal track?\n\nUPDATE: she's not
This is awful without auto tune
I like how arnold always loses 1 finger\nmake a vid where arnold is in a dangerous area and see the results of being suicidal like Chernobyl

PLEASE PLEASE SEND ARNOLD TO THE BOTTOM OF THE DEEPEST OCEAN. without any air

Gustav is still the best actor out of the bros
Close competition to Anythony Perkins' in Psycho
He's really got no accent as well. Sounds more American.
for a Swedish actor, he hides his accent well, sounds more American than anything.
Crazy one simply lip trick can make you famous. Lol
I love how in certain titles of videos by Conan, Skarsgard is spelled with the å, but not all of them. Funny.
1. Screaming\n2. Noob\n3. LOL\n4. Never seen it\n5. Dumb\n6. Jump scare\n7. Learned that the movie it is not that scary \n8. Ugly\n9. Stupid\n10. Fack\n😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒
The real horror here is his forehead....
does anyone just love how he says gustav?
IT was awesome ,he did an amazing job playing pennywise I might go see it for the 3rd time 😁
Dave Chappell would do it more justice. Or drew carry.
HEY GUYS IF YOU WANNA EARN A QUICK SUB, SUB TO ME AND I WILL SUB BACK ON MY OTHER ACCOUNT. COMMENT WHEN YOUR DONE!!!!!
Oh..I thought the forehead was fake
He's got that KSI rape race on lock 😂
Any small YouTubers wanna support each other?? ✨🌙🙏🏻
I can do that smile omg
Did you see his Sweden accent change to American accent!!!?
I'm too old to have a crush...but he's just too damn cute..
🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈 do you see blue or red?? Comment, I want to see who dies or not.
i'd still sit on his face..🤷🏻‍♀️😂

Man, he's hot
He did an incredible job as Pennywise. He was creepy asf
I can do that thing with the lip
I can actually do that...
didn't know underneath all that he was this fine
The movie was awesome I just watched it , the best It much better than the fist one !
Its actually kind of a goofy and endearing smile when your not thinking about it in the context of him being Pennywise tbh.
he'd be a really good joker.\n\n\nthoughts??
Idk why and how but i can do that face xD
He looks like a young Kevin Bacon wtf

God, Bill, you're so handsome at its finest
This foo could play Jim Carrey in a biopic
Conan should have asked him to do the dance as well! That would've been hilarious!
It's Missing the bunny teeth
The most creepy smile what i ever seen
He would be a fantastic version of The Joker in the upcoming movie.
With that face, he's even scarier than pennywise :/

Hello
que onda con ese cesped? jaja
y que queres, mira esa asquerosidad de cancha, apoya un pie y salta la pelota
Just an English comment in the middle of nowhere
ese cesped está vivo
jajjajjajajaja, ese tronco hp estava pensando en la burra q se iba a chancletiar despues del partido....jajjajajajajajaj\nmalo hdpta
Buena vitrina el river jajaja donde término este pelmazo... Xd
lo que las canchas callan
Si no pasaba nada con el cesped y era responsabilidad suya iba ser ridiculez!! Pero al hacer el movimiento para patear, el pie de apoyo (izquierdo) se hunde practicamente hasta el tobillo levantando toda la tierra que esta alrededor de la pelota!!
Jajaja no mames we No mames hijo de tu puta nadre!!! El wey se mamo alv jajajaja, +10 por el buen momazo! Sigue asi rufian! Zopotamadre se mamo el wey
le hizo daño jugar en el Cruz Azul jaja
Q cancha de mierda, es raro como se mueve el paso, q asco de terreno
Jajaja negro narco
Loony toons?
Jajaja negroo putoo
Arreglen ese pasto jaja que culiado
Que muerto q sos teo
😂😂😂
Jajajaja pero q idiota
Troncofilo
jajajaja jajajaja jajajaja
No le corran el arco a Teo jjaa
Pobre Teo si él es bueno,, había un topo en el Punto de penal yo lo vii,,,😂
que perro
claramente se ve que en el momento q apoya el pie izquierdo antes de impactar la pelota,se levanta el pasto y x ende ,sale el penal muy desviado.creo q no es culpa del jugador..es culpa del campo de juego..
es un madera este negro vende humo.tuvo suerte nomas.carroñero del orto
RIDICULO...ES EL NOMBRE DEL VIDEO.... PORQUE SI OBSERVAN MEJOR....SE SALE EL PASTO SINTETICO DE MIERDA QUE TIENE ESA CANCHA DE MIERDA.... RIDICULOS SON LOS QUE SE RIEN Y CRITICAN BOLUDECEN...MANGA DE BOLUDOSSSS
Viendo en cámara lenta, cuando apoyo el pie se levantó el balón.
Pobre Teo,lo cago el césped
Parece un volcan el punto de penal jajaja horrible la cancha peor que la de mardel.
Jajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajaja jajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajaja
le pego asi porque el portero le hizo un hueco al punto penal
veoq mas es de la grama
no me digan que en esta cancha de mierda se va a jugar la vuelta de Junior vs Cerro...
por no tomarse las vainas en serio teo nunca será del nivel de falcao ni james
Apoya el pie y se levanta la pelota. Un asco la cancha.
humofilo gutierrez
The ball moved when he stepped on his left foot, the earth moved the ball up.
Troncazo
y luego los burrioristas se quejan cuando les dicen que su cancha es un lodal completo
los cachacos chimbo chiquito y sus videos de ardidos, jr tu padre
ese gramado de barranquilla es asqueroso y eso disque le pusieron una nueva, pero sigue siendo una verguenza y lo mal quue nos hace quedar cuando juega la seleccion. Los mejores cespeds estan en Bogota, tanto en el campin como en el estadio de techo, y aclaro soy paisa por si las dudas
Pero putierrez a quien echaron de River, Racing, Lanús, Rosario, Cruz azul, Turquía, Sporting Lisboa y muy pronto del burrior por gamin, tronco, ladrón, atracador, homosexual, simio, bruto, narco, farsante, payaso, drogadicto, alcohólico, etc.
0:23 Al apoyar el pie izquierdo se ve cómo éste se hunde y una montaña de tierra suelta se levanta y mueve el balón. Lo único ridículo es jugar con un campo de juego en ese estado.
jejeje , bueno despues que no pase en una final todo bien, ahora que revisen que paso con el gramado en ese lugar, del resto el mejor gramado de este pais ante los potreros de metrallin, cali, rolota y demas abominaciones de estadios.
Does anyone have any suggestions where I can get cosmetic contacts for astigmatism? I haven't been able to find any.
She seems like she's just half-assing it now a days. Too hollywood for us now.
This is the only Pennywise makeup tutorial I've seen lately that I absolutely LOVE.
I think I'll do this but with pink and maybe some contour. I loved the movie and i totally want to go for the glam look for my school annual haunted house where I plan to be a carnie. I'll probably get punched but it'll be worth it
where did you get the contacts from??
Please do a ghost of a supermodel look using the pop luxe glow in the dark highlighter!!! It glows under Blacklights...
Can u try do two videos a week so
Hey mikey, I searched all over YouTube to find Ginger snaps tutorial for her simple wolf like makeup for Halloween but There was none. Think you can make a video tutorial on her?
Where can I get contacts like that? :')))
Great makeup!! It was so funny because when you said Alexa, my Alexa responded and then you said add contacts and she said I've added contacts to your shopping list!!! Hahaha!
Thank you so much for this video now I know what I'm going too be for Halloween 😜😜😜
I want to know what red face paint to use around eyes.\nPlease...

Can you do a Moana glam and gore tutorial as part of the Disney princess series? And maybe to a Mulan version as well.
Great tutorial thanx and like ur personality.
Loved IT 💜 See what I did there? Lol
You should do the creepy woman portrait from the IT movie. That would probably be something someone didn't do yet . 🤷🏻‍♀️
the movie is more of a comedy than a horror film but it was great
I rlly wanna see the makeup tutorial 🙏🏾🙏🏾
I'm already a ginger so do I have to lose my soul twice? You didn't specify and I can't go messing up this look!
I can't dye my hair in a natural ginger
What red water activated paint did you use for this look?
Hey Mykie!! (Sorry if I spelt that wrong)\nI love your videos, been a fan for a long time. You have definitely inspired me to learn SFX make up along side learning animation in uni. \nI was wondering if you would ever do a 'windigo' type SFX tutorial. You know like the creatures out of until dawn game (I think that was the name) but with your own special flare. \nI don't think I've ever seen you do that look before and would love to see you do it 😃\nKeep being amazing!!
mykie i love your videos💕, can you make please a tutorial of nemesis of resident evil 3 the videogame, there is no good tutorial of it:c (sorry for my inglish, i speak spanish)
I want to be a glam penny wise but don't know what to do for the costume

You should do a Jerome Valeska fx makeup! Like when he gets his face torn off!
I know who i'm gonna be at halloween now; Thank you ! ♥
this was posted on my birthday and that worries me
I have a question, this has nothing to do with the makeup in this vid but I wanted to do the jack-o-lantern makeup for Halloween. I'm  using latex and I just want to know is it easy to use?
I really like the combination of glam an gore! It's amazing
im new here. . is she scotty sire's sister? ??  she act soo much like him
I'm soo Doug this for Halloween 😂😂😍😍
Where did you got your teeth ?
I will never understand glamgore.

uNseVux0CA4,

uNseVux0CA4,Like you want to be a goth,  but you want to be safe about it.
I'm doing an IT/ Georgie crossover for Halloween and this video just helped me make my concept so much better😊😊
This look without the creepy contacts along with the creepy teeth would look good for a Christmas look. #cute
Mikey I have to admit that I was very reluctant to watch this. I am terrified of clowns and I have not seen the movie yet but your pennywise makes things a bit less terrifying. It kinda makes want to see the movie but maybe not. We'll see.
Do one using only makeup from wish
Fenty beauty commercial cane before your video. Fucking slayed
You killed it 👌🏼😍
your makeup so cool
Oh my god. So. Freaking. GOREGEOUS! Beautiful work Mykie!

Um. Wondering if she should be in bigger bed. Her little head seems cramped in there for fresh air. And breathing in general. Just a thought.
Why don't you have Anna pick up Eduardo with Alessia. That way you have a bigger chunk of time to do work with no distractions.
alessias wee face in the camera when anna was opening the stair gate melted my heart!
THUMBNAIL IS SO CUTE😩😩
aw alessia is such a cutie I love her little smiles and giggles! x
Definitely gonna have to buy one of the calendars this year!
Jonathan you do an awesome job vlogging every day and make the vlogs funnier as you can get them!!!!...I reallly appreciate you for letting us come into your home!!!....Thank You Guys!!!!!!
Can't wait for the bingo runs lol 😂
Jonathan the car won't start if the key isn't in it - like somewhere in the car
go to mummy and flick her ear!!...... goes to mum and hugs her! GAWD EDUARDO IS SO CUTE <3
Anyone know when they are coming to Ireland for a meet up x
Eduardo is a crazy lil kid haha throwing the blanket he was sitting on a minute ago
Completely agreed with what you were saying at the beginning Anna! LOVE vlogging and having things like my 21st birthday on YT so I can watch them back in the future!! 💕
Hi Jonathan, the key thing happened to me😩 I left the keys in house and drove the car 10 miles away and then when I tried to restart the car that's when I realised and my partner had to drive with my keys to give me power. It's a thing, it happens.. to many times for me unfortunately 😂
Jonathan!!! I wondered if you and Anna had seen this. I thought after you telling us about your very busy days this would make you both giggle....DISCLAIMER dont watch around kids.\nWatch Go the f**k to sleep, read by Samuel L Jackson on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/Udj-o2m39NA
Totally can relate. I have. 6 /4/2 and a 8mths old Between drop off pick ups in between errand after school clubs. I sometimes feel like a robot with the same schedule and no human time
i love you guys and your  banter
How do I make your channel not pop up.
Jonathan wait till they start joining more after school activities
cute photo of the kids. You guys make beautiful babies
this is the cutest thing <33\n\ncan you please make a christmas calender this year too? i loved the one last year, it really made it easier to wait for christmas <3
The kids are so cute!
Jonathan: what is missing ? Eduardo: food 😂😂
A lovely video I really enjoyed watching it :):) :):) Emilia, Eduardo and alessia are so cute Emilia was so adorable when she said  we have to run after Eduardo and when she got some mints out to eat 😀🐶❤️ Eduardo was so sweet when he said look grandma a lol doll and alessia looked so cute when she was smiling and looking at the camera :):) :):) \n\nAnna what you could do is give alessia a dummy for comfort x \n\nI can't wait for the calendar to come out x
the urge to have kids when i watch your videos jonathan....
that happened to my nana my granda opened the car and she drove away them when she turn the engine of she notice she didn't have the key 💗😂xxxxxx
Eduardo taking after his dad Good Morning my Friendliest Friend PRICELESS!!!
imagine if they gave Emilia the SacconeJoly yt account- Eduardo Anna’s and Alessia jonathan’s JSKDKSKSK
Can't wait to get my hands on the calendar! x
Eduardo singing to Alessia is just precious 💕💕 and a happy belated birthday to Emilia 😊😘
Love Eduardo's response to his Dad. Jonathan says What's missing to our picnic ?  Eduardo says  Food. Such a typical lovely boy.  :)
Wait. I'm sorry - Eduardo singing Good Morning Again... to Alessia JUST MADE MY OVARIES SKIP A BEAT whyyyy are your kiddos so flipping adorable 😭😭😭
I would have if I was Jonathon if I had to go through all these hurtful and bitter comments on here. Some of you people are so judgemental and nasty.
The car wont start without the keys in the car Jonathan (:
This has been my favourite vlog in a long long time. It was real and sincere there was no trying it was just a good old fashioned vlog
If you drive without the keys the car starts beeping and having a breakdown! You can only drive a certain distance away from the keys as well
😂😂😂😂 seems you should have brought some food to keep Eduardo occupied! Laughed so much when he said there was food missing from the picnic! That boy loves his food!
I accidentally drove my keyless car to the supermarket. I could open the door and start the engine because the car was in such close proximity to the keys sitting on the side inside the house, and (from my experience) the car allows you drive as long as the whole time your engine is running, but the second you turn the engine off you can't restart it! I had to be rescued from the car park by my Dad with the keys haha. I wouldn't try it!
My husband always has his car keys in his pocket when we're in the car, even if I'm driving. If I'm dropping him off somewhere he often gets out of the car with the keys & I get an ignition error message on the dash & can't go anywhere! 🙄
That´s what I´m really scared of having kids, they say its amazing having kids but all of those people saying that also say they have no time for them, and I´m kind of a loner I love to step time by myself and having my own space, I am not sure if people like me were meant o have kids. I know I will regret it if I have kids at the moment, but I know I will regret it in a few years (when I´m done with myself haha) if I don´t. That´s stress for me right now!
Guys for the tour tickets does each adult an kid need one? It says under 14s must be accompanied does this mean i need to buy ticket for child?
My mum once forgot her keys Jonathan! She got stuck when she parked and the car turned off haha my dad had to pick her up
eduardo and his dad have got such a good father son relationship 😊
Eduardo is me with the picnic!! You can’t promise me a picnic and not take food 😂
My mam managed to drive my dad's car without the key as she dropped him off at work and he forgot to give her the key. Luckily she remembered before switching off the engine so she managed to get back to him to collect the key!
You shouldn't let Eduardo hit you like that. Even if it's playing it's not the best idea to teach him that it's ok to play that rough. That's just my opinion as a case manager who works with kids. I have to teach sooooo many parents to stop playing that rough with kids because they do it at school since they don't understand the difference between playing at home and at school.
Why do you bathe Alessia every day? Her skin is going to get so dried out!
Anna you look unreal! Alessia is the cutest 😍
Whats missing? Food. \nThis is the best thing I've heard today.
What would Anna do if you had a 40 hour week 🎀job?
Couldn't stop laughing at Jonathan when he said look at that sunset in the morning 😂😂💜💜 3:17 , like if you are going to the book tour in Glasgow in November ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Awhhhh great to see Jonathan his family and the cute video's they made for Emilia her birthday. Love it!!! We don't see them often. Hope they can see their cousins soon
You should make an animation of the great catnap book on friendliest friends!
Alessia looks so much like Jonathan's family! Wow
Anna´s eyebrows are wayyyyyyyyy to red 😷
Jonathan is such a great dad.❤😍
I WANT THE CALANDER THIS YEARRR
What's the lipstick you put on in the beginning of this video? I like it very much!Thank you ..
Jonathan: What's missing?\nEduardo: Food.\n\nLITTLE BOY KNOWS WHAT'S UP 👏😂😂😂
@sacconejolys when are you moving house?!?
When the key gets to far the car wont run, my dad will drive and sometimes drop my mom off places and the keys are still in her purse so he cant drive away
Going on the bingo run 😂😂
Can not wait for the 2018 calendar my mom and I have gotten one for each of us both past years  💗 now we get one with Alessia 💗
Hey Jonathan! My family has a Toyota Prado and it also has a remote key. One time my boyfriend and I went to run some errands, so I put the key in my purse. He went and dropped me off at the supermarket, and left to run another errand about 40 min away. When he's on his way he calls me and tells me the car is beeping because it says there is a missing key! (I then realize I have my purse, so the key is with me! 🆘) He was way too far from me by this point, so he decides to keep going. He couldn't turn off the car when he got to his destination 😂 because with no key he wouldn't have been able to turn it back on! He then came back to pick me up, so we were good, but it was stressful! Hahahaha So basically I think it is a problem, but you can operate it 👌🏻
Some people need to take a chill pill. Anna and Jonathan have their own way of parenting and raising their children. Stop telling them what they should or shouldn't do. Also, stop being rude to Anna. Anna is an amazing mother and she doesn't deserve any of these mean comments. That's my rant for the night. Bye!
Alessia is growing so fast.think it's time she went into a cot as she's to big for the Moses basket...wow Emilia 5already ,I swear it was yesterday she was born lol.little Eduardo has come into his own and quite a handsome little boy xx
Whats missing...FOOD..jonathan!!its supposed to be a teddy bear picnic...too cute..eduardo bless you boy 😘😘😘
Super sweet hearing Eduardo singing good morning again to Alessia.
Baby 👶 is so cute oooohhhhh
Alessia's eye contact with the camera all the time is literally the cutest thing love it
I'm so in love with this family
OMG the Bingo run 😂😂 and Eduardo asking for food 💗
100% guarantee all these people who are complaining of Anna doing nothing have never had a baby before 🙄
The kids are soooooo cute and I am seeing u at the tour so excited
Yes that has happened to my grandma! My grandpa had the keys in his pocket as they were saying goodbye and she drove away while the keys were still in his pocket! She drove all the way to the store but couldn't start the car to get home! It was hilarious
I love this family from the bottom of my heart !
I spy a Marinette doll
Food fixes everything
Alessa smiling is the most precious thing ❤❤
Have they moved?
Eduardo waking alessia 😍😍😍
Omg Anna looks so pretty ❤️💜🌸
Loved  Jonathan  singing Tupac 😂
eduardo singing to alessia was soooooooo cute.... aaaawww... my heart is melting
Love this 😘
Fooood. That was so cute Eduardo
Love you all

Are you seriously moaning about how busy you are Jonathan? You work at home you have nothing to complain about please stop and get a real job
Lol the whole forgetting your key in the car but the car is open RomanAtwood has done it and he drove to the store and found out that he didn't have keys so he had to leave his car on and go into the store
Is there a school bus system in england?
Her voice is everything

This is absolute awesomeness got my mind blown thanks for that ♥️
must have in your music gallery 😍
This is the best that's ever happened to me
Lyrics\n\nAll I can ever be to you\nIs a darkness that we know\nAnd this regret I've got accustomed to\nOnce it was so right\nWhen we were at our height\nWaiting for you in the hotel at night\nI knew I hadn't met my match\nBut every moment we could snatch\nI don't know why I got so attached\nIt's my responsibility\nAnd you don't owe nothing to me\nBut to walk away I have no capacity\nHe walks away\nThe sun goes down\nHe takes the day but I'm grown\nAnd in your way, in this blue shade\nMy tears dry on their own\nI don't understand\nWhy do I stress the man\nWhen there's so many bigger things at hand\nWe could a never had it all\nWe had to hit a wall\nSo this is inevitable withdrawal\nEven if I stop wanting you\nA perspective pushes through\nI'll be some next man's other woman soon\nI can not play myself again\nI should just be my own best friend\nNot fuck myself in the head with stupid men\nHe walks away\nThe sun goes down\nHe takes the day but I'm grown\nAnd in your way, in this blue shade\nMy tears dry on their own\nSo we are history\nYour shadow covers me\nThe sky above ablaze\nHe walks away\nThe sun goes down\nHe takes the day but I'm grown\nAnd in your way, in this blue shade\nMy tears dry on their own\nI wish I could say no regrets\nAnd no emotional debts\nCause as we kiss goodbye the sun sets\nSo we are history\nThe shadow covers me\nThe sky above ablaze that only lovers see\nHe walks away\nThe sun goes down\nHe takes the day but I'm grown\nAnd in your way, ma blue shade\nMy tears dry on their own\nHe walks away\nThe sun goes down\nHe takes the day but I'm grown\nAnd in your way, my deep shade\nMy tears dry on their own\nHe walks away\nThe sun goes down\nHe takes the day but I'm grown\nAnd in your way, my deep shade\nMy tears dry on their own
i cant, i just hear her voice and get an install orgasm

OHMYGODN THE COLLABORATION THE WORLD NEEDS
I love her so much
All I can ever be to you\nIs the darkness that we knew,\nAnd this regret I've got accustomed to.\nOnce it was so right,\nWhen we were at our high,\nWaiting for you in the hotel at night.\n\nI knew I hadn't met my match,\nBut every moment we could snatch,\nI don't know why I got so attached.\nIt's my responsibility,\nAnd you don't owe nothing to me,\nBut to walk away I have no capacity.\n\n[Chorus:]\nHe walks away,\nThe sun goes down,\nHe takes the day\nBut I'm grown,\nAnd in your way,\nIn this blue shade\nMy tears dry on their own.\n\nI don't understand\nWhy do I stress a man\nWhen there's so many bigger things at hand.\nWe coulda never had it all,\nWe had to hit a wall,\nSo this is inevitable withdrawal.\nEven if I stop wanting you,\nA perspective pushes through,\nI'll be some next man's other woman soon.\n\nI shouldn't play myself again,\nI should just be my own best friend,\nNot fuck myself in the head with stupid men.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nSo we are history,\nYour shadow covers me\nThe sky above,\nA blaze,\n\n[Chorus]\n\nI wish I could say no regrets,\nAnd no emotional debts,\n'Cause as we kiss goodbye the sun sets\n\nSo we are history,\nThe shadow covers me,\nThe sky above,\nA blaze that only lovers see,\n\nHe walks away,\nThe sun goes down,\nHe takes the day\nBut I'm grown,\nAnd in your way,\nMy blue shade\nMy tears dry on their own.\n\nHe walks away,\nThe sun goes down,\nHe takes the day\nBut I'm grown,\nAnd in your way,\nMy deep shade\nMy tears dry on their own.\n\nHe walks away,\nThe sun goes down,\nHe takes the day\nBut I'm grown,\nAnd in your way,\nMy deep shade\nMy tears dry
DUA YOU BETTER SING THIS ON TOUR BB 🖤
This is awesome. I really look forward to what she'll bring to the table with more style and various kind of songs
Omgggg soooo gooooodd
The dudes singing all the big parts, the guy has a nice voice
I'm dying to hear more of this. Voice quality is UGH, too much to bear. GALING!
No fucking way. Two of my favorite artists are singing together. I love this.
Damn, that was slick! They took it to church :D
Everyone talking about Dua but oh my, Gallant's voice is sweeeeeeeeet

When Dua hit that second verse, I start bawling. God bless you Amy Winehouse. Look at what your art did? 💖💗
WHAT. A. DUO. \nThey both have amazing vocals and together they sound even better! Loved this performance of them

This is truly beautiful. So much talent, and such a beautiful tribute.
I absolutely HATE when people cover any song from Amy but this isn't bad at all. Love them

OBSESSED WITH YOUR HAIRRRR!😍😍🙌🏽🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺
I wasn't to quick to jump the Fenty Beauty hype train either but I did get the foundation and I love it. I have oily skin and I was impressed to see that my makeup stayed on and didn't start to look funky after a few hours. Definitely will be getting a few more products and possibly an extra bottle of the foundation.
Ugly girl
you are GLOWING!💫
Looks lovely Fleur
Always reliable reviews! Thanks Fleur! That lip gloss looks amazing.
LOVED the casual setup! :)
Love your videos 😘
love it
You are my favorite You Tuber!!! ❤️❤️❤️🤗🤗
Love your nail color
£6&10 p&p !!!
This is probably the millionth fenty video I'm watching 
Do you not have your apartment in London anymore?
Loved your review, it was so honest which was lovely! The foundation looks like my colour which is nice because I am so pale and there are hardly any options out there so it is good that she is covering all shades :) I am so excited that you are pregnant, I can't wait for baby de force!!!
You picked the ame shades in the Match Stix and Killawatt  as I did  but I am shade 300-320 lol a TRUE medium-tan gal.
Your skin looks so beautiful and float with this collection!!
You're so pretty!! Love this review and look
Such a shame about the foundation colour. I'm excited to see how the products work on my skin. Thanks for the review! Xx
What's that nail polish? Looks amazing <3
Looks like the perfect foundation shade for me so at least you've helped someone find the right shade even though you've lost money haha! Thankyou! X
I love it that you are so honest but beauty products xx \n theoctoberedit.blogspot.com
My foundation Shade is NW 15 for MAC. What Shade would suit me best? I live nowhere near a Harvey Nicholes :(
Brill video! What nail polish have you got on here Fleur? I love the colour! 💜 xxx
Hi! What nail polish are you wearing? I love it!!!
Love the stripes and dungarees combo ❤
I loved how chill this video was! And your review was soooo helpful - I was also hesitant to spring for another celeb range but now I totally want to try out a few pieces!
HI Fleur you look lovely!  Sprinklyofglitter tagged you in a baby name tag can you do it? Would love to hear your answers xo C
I definitely have my eye on a few of these products after watching this! Loved the set up of this video, Fleur!
I love the highlighter duo too. Not a big fan of cream products, but might give the cream blusher/highlighter and cream contour a go.
Iv been watching your videos for yours and i really love the old way of reviewing you have bought back, its felt more natural and like heres the products lets talk! Really enjoyed this video , hope you do many more like this!
you are literally glowing throughout your pregnancy!! <3
Rihanna did go an awesome job she SLAYED her products
Did you put blotting sheets in the wrong way around??
Love videos like this! Feels so down to earth and you look stunning!
Great review. I really enjoyed your thoughts and the makeup looked beautiful.
LOVE this more casual chatty video!! xx
Love the set up for this video! So 'at home'. Thanks for your review :)
Actual product review begins at 11:07. You're welcome. GEEZ! SMH
The Estée Lauder cushion what shade did you use please...it looked gorgeous -\nAs are you!!\nThanks for this,found it really helpful.
I know the foundation wasn't the right shade for you, but kinda wish you had kept it on! I've heard the sticks don't pair particularly well with the foundation formula and wanted to hear your thoughts on it aside from color match!
You look stunning!!! Natural beauty+pregnancy glow= beyond words beauty! Fleur you look lovely, and by far the best/most honest reviwe I've seen so far! Lots of love! Xx Tatty
Hi Fleur do you think the Fenty primer is better then the Two Faced Hangover one?
I love this sort of video! You're so gorgeous but I must say, I'm still not excited by this brand. It seems expensive but cheap...
I always trust your reviews... I tried the gloss on my hand at Sephora , the smell is amazing! It's so pretty.
This is my favourite video of yours in ages. It was a really professional review, IMO. I really like how you gave candid first impressions of the good and bad of each product, whether or not you ended up liking or disliking them. I feel like it was really honest and helpful! I agree with the others, as well: I'm not sure if you've changed your lighting or hair colour, but you're looking extra stunning in yourself here, too. Keep it up!
Great video! The casual vibe, the fact that you paid for the products, watching you apply it like in the old days, all of it! Loved it!
Honestly i loved this style of video!
I don't know if this is true but I have heard that the foundation oxidises to a few shades darker x
Hey Fleur! There have been too many beauty videos lately... At least for me... How about some bags? Shoes? Thanks!
Really love this review, very genuine.....more less planned videos in the future 👍👌
Your pregnancy really suits you! You're stunning! <3
Great video, I fully expected to hear you hating the products because I tend to associate you with higher end brands and products. I really love that you got excited as a consumer and I agree that your video seems to be the most unbiased so far! Love the laid back feel too! Xx
The blotting paper looks like rizla skins and a rolling machine for joints 😂😂😂😂
1) your excitement is contagious, 2) your make up afterwards looks BEAUT, 3) girl, that t-shirt and dungarees are a LOOK
dont think u knew how to pull the blotting paper out because ive seen others do it just fine ..
Where are your dungarees from? x
Loved this video. Loved how long it was and informal. Just chilling it with a friend style.
you literally have a holiday glow with this ! <3
great review. really thorough and well-explained. your word choice is so specific and accurate. keep it up!
I really liked this old style video with a classic review and try on. Looks great and now I would love to go out and pick up that lipgloss! :)
I realize this video was a little on the spontaneous side; that being said, I REALLY enjoyed it. It felt very authentic and had a nice, relaxing vibe. This video was a great example of how you don't need to go all out to make quality content. If the enthusiasm is there, the rest will follow. \nOn a slightly unrelated note, I don't know what it is about this particular video, but you really looked like Hannah in some parts of it. I've never really thought that before. Obviously, I've noticed the familial similarities, but I've never looked at the both of you together and thought, twin moment. For the record, that was meant to be a compliment. You both are beautiful gals!
Really love this style of video, Fleur! Please do more first impression/live haul type videos. xx
Loved this video Fleur! I find that I prefer videos like this (you called it raw). I like it without a studio or studio lighting etc. It feels more natural and less produced and therefore more real. I hope more youtubers go back to this style of video. I want to feel like a friend is telling me about products, not selling me some on HSN. Great job and you look fab!
Fleur, do you still have the London apartment?
LOVE this style of video! You're glowing and look absolutely stunning!!!
I don't think I'm going to indulge in this line myself, but it does look lovely. And I loved the more relaxed, hands-on review style -- both informative and casual, like a (circumstantially one-sided) conversation with a friend!
Might have to get the lip gloss!!
What's your nail color? It's so pretty!
Love this - you should do more first impression videos!
Totally random, but what colour / brand nail polish are you wearing??? Its gorgeous!! x
please do more first impressions just like this! casual, honest, no big production required, just a good solid chat... loved it!
Your skin looks incredible!! Please please do a cushion foundation best and worst! X
The contour colour looks amazing on you!
I'm glad u gave it a good review! I wasn't hyped about the line either BUT once I found out what was in the range, my interest was peaked! I only purchased the lippie and primer. They were out of my foundation and I can't buy anymore highlighters until I've used up what I have. Seriously, how many do u actually need?!?! Ultimately, I'm pleased to see that u liked it bcuz as a black woman, the range of foundations for us is  UNHEARD OF. We still don't have a STRONG market catering to us and our beauty with ALL its many shades. So, I think THAT is really what the hype was about. Black women/girls felt like, FINALLY, someone thought exclusively about US! It's not so much about Riyanna (did I spell that right?) and if my Caucasian, and Asian sisters don't understand that, then you've missed the whole point. #bravo Fleur!
Loved the style of this vid xx
I feel like you match exactly my colouring! Hope you get to try the foundation in the right shade one day
Loved the style of this video, very natural X x
Tear the blotting paper against the blade from one side to the other instead of ripping it :)
Love this video Fleur! So different for you, in a good way 😊 you also look absolutely beautiful! X
Are you going to get a foundation that matches for a second review?
Oh my goodness I love love loved this video! I enjoyed the more relaxed vibe you had going on and you are looking so beautiful. Love to you, Mike & all your fur children! Xx
I hope your read this, but I'm in love with your tragus piercing. Would you mind sharing where you got it? It's so cute!
Your skin looks amazing 😍 pregnancy is really working for you! Are you going to try another shade of foundation? Would be good to hear your opinion of your shade, also love the casualness to the video xxx
I wish you used the white because I haven't seen a review with it yet
very nice video, good review :)
your skin looks amazing in this Fleur! <3
You should never buy makeup online , you should always try it first on your face (physically go to the shop)  , because when you buy online it always ends up being lighter or darker in real life.
I really appreciate your review and POV!
I have never been drawn to packaging. I don't get that. When shopping for make-up I don't look at packaging at all. Coz what does it help when the product itself is sh**?
Loved this video!! I would have thought, though, that this brand was made by the same guys who did Kim K's line!  I dunno if I'm too sold on many of the products -- I might try the highlighter!
Love the autheticity, you are for sure the best looking wife doing stuff around the house 😉 love your videos and I love the pregnany content and home vlogs/weekend vlogs with mike the most 😊 👫🐕💖
It wasn't Rihanna fans rushing to the stores to get some, it's the POC finally having their shades.
I wanted to say thank you for doing this!  A lot of vloggers who are not women of color are turning their noses up at this. Thank you for doing this for your colorful audience!
what shade are you in estee lauder double wear cushion?
Turn the blotting tube upside down (tooth side down) then rip. As opposed to ripping up upward. Side note, love your nail color 😍
Which colour you have in the Estee lauder cushion foundation .😄
i've missed the tutorials ! :)
Really REALLY loved this style of video, including the natural looking lighting. It seemed very spare of the moment and I got the feeling you weren't planning on putting the makeup on to start with. Something about it just seems so natural and friendly (not saying you aren't always friendly 😁) keep them coming and I hope you are keeping well xxx
Fleur's reviews are the best reviews 💕
Short?  We need a full length film of this !!!
This is one of those few times where I happily exclaim, Make it 4hours long, Make it a series, Make it a Mini-Series!!  This collaboration of Blade Runner and Shinichiro Watanabe is just too perfect to simply condense it into a short film...
See you space blade runner...
ｍｏｒｅ　ｈｕｍａｎ　ｔｈａｎ　ｈｕｍａｎ
Anime, cyberpunk and FlyLo, as if that isn't the best combination
Holy shit this is perfect. I really hope we get to see more stories from this world in different formats.
this is probably gonna turn out better then the new movie
By Shinichiro Watanabe! Holy shit fuck the new movie i want the anime version :D
A western movie being adapted into anime? YES This is what I'd like to see more, not the other way around and end up with shitty adaptations...
i guess we're gonna need this short to be significantly less short than it is probably gonna be... more like 150-something minutes short...
I can't believe we're getting a new Shinichiro Watanabe project with music from Flying Lotus. This is literally a dream come true. I'm sure the movie will be great in its own right, but this is something else.
Also, is it just me, or doesn't those animation sheets look pretty massive in physical scale compared with most other standard animation paper? Or is it to accomodate more detailed drawings for theatrical cinemascope animations?
I'm glad they put subtitles on, because I don't know Japanese...
I never asked for this...but I'm glad.
I need a background of the girl at 1:01
I'm freaking stoked about this. This is going to be amazing.
I came. I saw. I came. What a lovely year for cyberpunk!
Good to see the world of BR coming back to life again.
They could expand this into a 26 episode series, it'd definitely find a market.
This looks pretty awesome, and is immediately on top of my must-watch list.
OH WOW! Something decent will come out of this sh*t movie sequel.
how long will this be?
This looks like Under the Dog but good.
This is the best news I've heard in a while
idk if the anime short version are good or bad, but if is good, i hope they make it into featrue film.
Been waiting for this since 1984 when I first got into anime, and Shinichirō Watanabe is directing! ^_^
I hope it's longer than 5 minutes.
hopefully this gets Subbed and sony doesn't fuck over everyone who doesn't know japanese who wants to watch it.
Warner Bros USA olease put the anime in the home video release
I love anything Watanabe related, it's gonna be amazing <3
대박 이건 봐야해!!!

This is awesome news.
see you space cowboy...
Oh yes
nice
製作時間…。_ﾛ(･ω･=) ｹｼｹｼ
WOW
ほほう
渡辺監督なら観ないと！
I wished we can Kickstart this for a whole mini-series.
Hope the movie does well so hopefully we get a full blade runner universe with books, games and other media.
why dont make an anime series with this quality????? WHY WHY!!! ;)
Coming soon... How soon is soon? And when it arrives, HOW DO WE WATCH IT?! ... legally, that is...  I have gotten to the point where I refuse to pirate stuff...  :D
Looks like another Ghost in the Shell movie. Look i like Anime, but Blade Runner shouldnt turn into Anime. The *Live* action movie is a Masterpiece, turning this into Anime is really mediocre, maybe the style and Visuals will be pretty and awesome, like Akira. But where does the Lore fit? They also ruined Godzilla with the mediocre, bad Cgi Grootzilla movie...
私の中で神格化された作品だけに、その続編というのは複雑な心境だ。コケるくらいなら最初から作らないでほしいという気持ちもある。果たして上手くいくかどうか・・・頼むぜ。
So a black dude and a fucking chick, just LIKE everything else these days... PASS!
From this valley they say you are leaving\nWe shall miss your bright eyes and sweet smile\nFor you take with you all of the sunshine\nThat has brightened our pathway a while\n\nRIP good sir
RIP dear Harry (Carl) :(
Seeing him play this made me deeply happy. I think he's one of the finest actors around.
We need a Harry Dean Stanton sings Country album, ASAP!
R.I.P.
Rest in Peace Harry
Good night, sweet prince. :'(
Love Harry, such amazing artist!!!
Who in the world would leave a thumbs down?  Seriously???
This made me tear up. Rest in peace, man.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton. You will be missed.
Rest in Peace, Harry!
oh fuck, just heard about his passing. What a man though, a long life being in great movies. I'm so glad Lynch brought him back for Twin Peaks, this scene especially was just the sweetest thing.\nWe'll miss ya, Harry ;_;
Rest in peace Mr Stanton. You are cool until the very end
... it's a fuckin' nightmare.
RIP Harry, you lived a good long life and were a damn fine actor.
We have had the privilege of receiving Harry Dean as a Lynchland Guest recently, and we shared his 15 favorite songs in a special Guest Mix on his birthday on July 7th.\n\nhttp://bit.ly/HarryDeanMix
So beautiful. Rest In Peace, Mr. Stanton.
CUTE!
Thanks. I like it https://goo.gl/xyuXiF
And we will miss you, and your great music, & acting Harry Dean RIP but,= at least your music lives on to be listened to & enoyed + still to shine on!
Rest in peace legend
I am not the only one who thought this one of the best moments in the series. RIP.
Legendary character actor Harry Dean Stanton died on Friday 15.9.2017.
RIP the great Harry Dean!
Rest in Peace Harry, You never delivered a single bad performance. I hope they have a cigarette waiting for you in heaven.
RIP Carl . Glad we got to see you again in Twin Peaks The Return.
Rest In Peace, Harry Dean Stanton xx
RIP- This is a tough jam, knowing it as his last.
Rest In Peace, brother.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton.  May Carl Rodd finally find some peace.
R.I.P I will keep my blood
I had a dream about him last night. So sad. I thought he would live forever!
R.I.P Harry Dean Stanton Kudos to David Lynch for letting him appear in Twin Peaks - The Return and for making him play his guitar and sing. :'(
The light went out at the Fat Trout Trailer Park. RIP Harry Dean Stanton (aka Carl Rodd). You'll be surely missed by all TP fans.
is it just me or is the sound a little weird?  low volume and 'wavey'.
RIP. A legendary actor and a great one at that
Rest In Peace brother. So glad I got to see him preform one last time.
THANK YOU FOR ALL THE MEMORIES! YOUR SMALL PARTS AND FILM WILL BE REMEMBERED!!!
I just want to say, good night, sweet prince, may flights of angels sing thee to thy rest. Harry Dean Stanton. Rest in peace.
Farewell, Harry. You went out still giving your best.
Rest in peace, Harry Dean Stanton you golden voiced champion. I'm so glad we got to see so much of him in the new Twin Peaks.
i love harry dean stanton so much. idk why. but hes just so loveable
My favourite classic country song.
R.I.P. Harry...

RIP Harry Dean Stanton. One of the great character actors who's been in so many great movies.
please let's get this on the series soundtrack!
Right
Are we just gonna ignore De Bruyne's pass at the end of the game???
Early days but I think an english team could win it this year. Best bunch of teams we've had in the champions league for quite a lot of years now
They were the easiest goals I have ever seen\nWhat a Feyenoord doing
Man City look like a different class at the moment. They ripped Liverpool apart the other day😪 And destroyed Feynoord today⚽️
Media always pay to much attention to opposition teams playing badly vs City and never give City credit.
Feyenoord got hit with two stones
De bryune is amazing his passing is filth
Second game in a row we've smashed a team that sing YNWA
Feyenoord so bad lol
did anyone notice de bruyne's reaction at 0:31?? hahaha
KDB is absolutely insane! He has something special that no other football players have! He has such vision and control and plays intelligently! He is so accurate! 🤘🏻👑
arsenal will win champions league
Best team ever. Come at me haters! 🖕🏿
I am a man u fan but Mendy was worth the amount city payed 4 him
Gabriel Jesus > Rashford
Kevin d...was that a shot or a pass jks
Manchester city look strong this year .
Ok then well done bt

Easy
When did feyenord sign Odell Beckham jr
.
Poor Feynoord
*Jesus* ftw
T
Feyenoord did well! Lol
Ayy
Kun Aguero, their greatest ever European scorer \n\nLast Time I checked Argentina was in South America...
KDB better then kroos and modric, kroos and Modric are called the best because they are at real madrid
City might have the cash but can never buy history
Come On guys let's get BT to 400k subscribers
Let's play a game. Which UCL game was Arsenal fans & players watching?
This is what happens when Brad Jones plays in goals...
lol  😂😂😂
City have just smashed arguably the best side in Europe atm 4-0. There's no reason why we can't go on and win it now! #FeyenoordWho?
First one is an own goal. Comes off one leg which is going wide and then the other knocks it back on goal.
I hope Man City lose their next game
Anyone else hear that metal gear solid sound or am i bugging out
i'm scared to watch spurs against city this year... city look solid
BT Only said that Feyenoord played bad.\nNever said we were good. City bashers all over
Arab FC.
And to think Man City were gonna swap aguero for Sanchez aguero the far superior player.
Aguero being their greatest scorer in Europe isn't so impressive when the only time they have been to the Champions league is the past 6 years.
0:56\nEuropean? Someone needs a geography lesson...
Title is wrong says 3-0 to feyenoord

Hellooo this cake is AMAZING you are so much talented, hello from Belgium!😊☺❤😃😀😘
Try the Japanese cheesecake
WATAMELON
Would be extremely cool if nick opens a cupcake cafe/Pop up store x everyone would live for those gorgeous cupcakes & cakes !! 💖
NICK!! i have a burning question: are you never triggered/annoyed by the crumbs or the sauces (anything liquid really) drip through the crevasses on your table (or work bench or whatever you call it)? like how do you clean it... (im huge fan of your creations btw!!)
do a collab with Rosanna!
This is #watermelongoals 🍉🍉🍉🍉
Still waiting on PEACH, dude!
Nic's FREAKSHAKE brings all the views to the yard.... He could teach you, but he'll have to charge.... $30 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ur vid just got likeeeeeedddd😅
Too cooked for this
His creations are so unique, cute, and impressive, and I love how his personality shines through in his work. If he doesn't already it'd be too cool if he opened up his own little bakery.
here since 20k...but i always forgot to subscribe rip
you are making good
Who actually watches this and makes it im just here to crave sugar.
This is the perfect Halloween treat to hand out on the South Side of Chicago next month. Just don't put them in a big bowl, leave them on the porch, and tape a please take only one sign. You might cause a gang war over who gets the most watermelon cupcakes
Loved it !
Halo top
Any suggestions for substitutes for all of the milk products?
Why does the butter look like cheese
There's a cupcake in my home made of watermelone
That's a neat mixer
Everything you put out is so amazing and looks gorgeous.
Can you made smores macarons and plis continue making freakshakes cupcakes i love them, love your decorations, especially the ones with the donat lol
Looks good I'm new to your channel
WATERMELON ISL LIFE
I just want to stick my finger in that hole.
Omfg, don't worry sweetie. Rosanna Pansinos children fans always do this, they accuse people of copying her when they didn't at all or because it was never her original work to begin with! They legit do this ALL THE TIME. They did this to Ann Reardon with the unicorn cake that was never Rosannas original creation to begin with. Who knew watermelon flavor cake in the summer is copying someone lol. P.S, your cupcake is way cooler and more creative!
I just love you. You are beautiful and amazing
Hi , your videos are really good . Maybe next time you could try rainbow marshmallows meringues cupcake ?
ur editing is awesome (small youtuber admirer here) I spend more time on my thumbnails then I do on my videos. Maybe I need to reverse that
Do u need the Greek yogurt?
Where do you buy your cupcake liners and what's the brand ?🎂
So creative! These are so cute!
Done!! and loved the video
Man I thought it was called Watermelon freshcake my god I can't read

After all this look-all-the-same-doll-cakes, I'd love to see your version of a doll-cake... I imagine an explosion of crazy colours and glitter, sparkles, sprinkles and gold and maybe some beyonce-ness... 😍😊😍
Looks amazing but I wouldn't know where to start eating it?! xD
why is your salt pink?
This cupcake is identical to the chocolate and mint freak shake cupcake, just a different flavor. Not complaining though. O love watermelon.

STOP BEING SO GODDAMN FUNNY YOU DELIGHTFUL HUMAN BEING!!!
I don't wanna do this one
I'm tired but nice vid make more plz thx
i know she's joking around but she actually looks great! ❤
That green pant suit looked amazing on you Grace!!!!!
Oh my god....... was so confused why this was an actual video and so sincere !!! This is classic grace !!!
In the androgynous look grace looks like a really cool girl who's a lesbian but doesn't believe in labeling herself also has hardcore commitment issues, doesn't believe in traditional relationships and I would have a huge crush on
Only the green pants suit would have been in dress code at my high school.
I LOVED THIS😂😂😂 but also she looked super cute in like ALL THOSE OUTFITS
This is the funniest shit I've seen all week
My favorite part of this video was Brooks' reflection in the glass door where you could tell he was filming in his boxers.
Why do you look great in all of them??
I love videos like this, always super funny. \nYour dad is Gene Simmons\nNo!
I like the 5th one
grace grace grace grace!!!!! I need to tell you, I liked this video XD
Your outfit / fashion reviews are my favourite 🙌👏👏👏😂
Let's talk about how freaking great she looked in the androgynous outfit
LIVING FOR THE ROCK PRINCESS LOOK! 🌸🎸🌸
The green pantsuit reminds me of that guy who wants to cut down all the trees in the Lorax 😂
BOYFRIEND GRACE IN THIS VIDEO
did Grace just do an actual, serious lookbook?
I did not expect any of this...
You have such good style!!! So cute
You always looks super cute but I wouldn't be able to wear any of those outfits at school except maybe the green professional
OK but Grace, how do you look amazing in every single one of these outfits! ❤👌😱
all of these outfits are so cool and hot and the way you do this sort of look book thing is so funny you big weirdo i love it!!!!!!!!!
You could definitely be a model you're gorgeous and you looked great in every one of the outfits 👑
Grace we get it you look cute in everything
I DIED AT CASUAL FRIDAY😭😭😭😭😭❤️
You're not a doctor
Grace I luv ya but ya forty as fuck.\nFor sure let's let the kids handle 1st period issues. Jk jk
Grace's legs on the Rock Princess look!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SO GOOD
Chester see, come back and get yo pants
Real talk where was the skirt from in the 3rd outfit I love it
I actually like the outfits... well done Grace. I flipping love you.🙌🏼
these are all cute as hell but like I can't wear any of them other than the pant suit because of damn dress code smh
Okay but where is the professional suit from thank you and please
Excuse me, Miss Helbig. That green suit is AMAZING. In all seriousness, that green suit. 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Please do more of these!! In any way shape or form, I love your fashion videos
The you're not a doctor part made me bust up laughing😂😂😂😂
The green one had a Riddler vibe lol
I'm home-schooled so pajamas everyday!\n(Also, that green pants suit is giving me INSANE Onceler vibes.)
To make the androgynous look complete, you should wear either a knit stocking cap or a baseball cap with your hair stuffed up inside it. Or cut it short like Ellen (or shave your head completely, if you *really* want to commit to the look).   ;-)
Why do I love this so much????
Grace legit looks amazing in all of these 😂❤️
to be serious for a second, what is this back to school outfit thing about? I mean why don't you  wear the same shit you wore in summer? and if the first day of school is a little colder then wear something warmer than last week.
What about kids who go to school who have to wear uniform?
WOULD 100% WEAR EACH OF THOSE OUTFITS DO MORE OF THESE
this is me leaving a comment down below
He Never Came Back should be the title of your next book.
2:05 SHE'S WEARING KRISTEN'S MERCH!!!!😱😱😍😂 AND GRACE IS ONE OF KRISTEN'S FAV YOUTUBERS!!
i like very muuuuuch
DRESS CODE
outfit 4 brings out the gay in me
Green pantsuit is like a combo of Hillary Clinton and heather duke hhhahaha
Better (y)
kristen's merch!!!!
This wasn't helpful because 1) I started school August 14th and 2) I'm at a military college so I'm in uniform every single day. But still enjoyable. I liked the pantsuit.
Your orchid went fishing and caught a stuffed toy
Number 2 makes me think of the lesbian teacher who would be 100% dtf a student
downloading and firing up my unmosaic engine!!!!
not gonna lie, i would kill for that green suit
You're not a doctor is my new favorite comeback.
All of these looks were actually hella cute. Like if she had resisted the urge to troll it up a bit, this would be a legit beauty/fashion video with some real cute looks. It wouldn't be Grace though without a little bit of troll.
I am feelin' all of those outfits
If you have a uniform is you education a lie?
I know it's supposed to be a parody but I liked all the outfits
Grace you are amazing but my babe no these outfits kill the school dress code in so many ways.
You're not even in school wtf are u doing
😂😂😂
Oh loved all tho!
'Your dads Gene SImmons' HAHAHA so funny
*initiate awkward dinosaur hands*
Gosh,  Grace how can one person be so freakin' funny and awkward and adorable and weird hahaha

Congrats on the 5M subs! That's an insane milestone. I'm a very new sub, but your videos are well-done, and deserving of all the support. Best of luck on your continued growth, my dude!
Man, you should make a video letting us know how to start our channel, since now you're pretty well established. I myself was planning to focus on the Latin American market, but have no idea how to kick the door. Care to help?
Congratulations MKBHD . Hope you get many more .
May i know what is your daily driver?  S8?
Trying to hide the happiness
I'm a bit myth'd by the amount of views, I know people would rather direct their attention to other youtubers and so on, with all the people around the world that do tune in and watch, I'm surprised it isn't a hell of a lot more! And that isn't with only Marquez B. Vlog, this is all users producing content to watch. I literally am myth'd
How u get 5m subscribers?? Make a video abt that plz
Where's this being broadcast from?

This night i dreamt i met you in a restaurant. It was pretty awesome, we got interrupted by my family because they were going to sing happy birthday to someone and got mad at me for making them wait. So i asked you for your snapchat but you said no :( Still an awesome dream.
One of the first channels I have subscribed on YouTube and you should feel proud!!! Well deserved.
Hey Marques, just wondering but why is it so hard to find camcorders that specifically mention that they have the ability to shoot 1080p at 60fps? Also is there any that you would recommend? (and no my budget inst too big of a issue either)

Can't wait to see him in Montreal.... montreal gang where your you at ?????
Hey Nile! So lately in your video's i saw an amazing move wich I just HAVE to know the name of. Im really in handstands and that stuff so i would really like to know. It was a move where you were laying flat on your belly with your arms by your side, where you then quickly starded lifting your feet up higher and higher untill you got into a handstand. Then whilest in the handstand you slowly came down in a pushup manner to rest again, laying flat on your belly.\nThank you very much and i loveeee your videos. Keep it up!
2:08 that smile...2:226 that fall haa ha haaa you're like lil kids ha ha
sou muito seu fã Nile Wilson
My team and I did rugby blindfold... We're crazy 😜
I don't have any idea if you read these or not, but it would be great if you did a Gymnastics vs. Martial Arts.
●●COME SEE MY CHANNEL AND WATCH MY VIDEOS! TRYING TO GET TO 100 SUBS●●
That redhaired gymnast is FINE!\nI hope he didn't hurt his foot...
If only you could do Olympic quality gymnastics... 😦😢😭 \nBring it on! 😃 \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
5:09 that whole part was so cute. This is so positive i love it.
talented .... wish I could move in cat like manner .... they seem brain dead but it's probably their way of releasing tension & having fun...... anyway love 'em all 💋
The big lebowski clip of Jesus is my fav in the whole movie. Lmao wow good stuff!
Though you were going to do some blindfold tricks
if you ice your ears then use a sharp earring and put as much pressure as possible you can repierce your ear
When u think yourself as a gymnast then u see Nile 😂  \nNile is my fav youtuber
these videos bring back so many memories of my younger days when i did some gymnastics. mostly what i remember though, is that the gym always smelled like ass....lol
Why is it every video is on trending but you haven't got at least 1M subscribers?
i love this style of editing, good job! @00:54
It is great to see that you are well Nile and training hard for the competition, I'm sure this effort will be rewarded. Hugs man
We LOVE you here in Atlanta, Nile. You're infectiously chiper and lovable. congrats on the champiionship and good luck in Canada.
loved this vid mate!! Keep up the good grind boy 😎💖💯
Wilson is literally the best gymnastics male human being 👏👏👏
Trying to study Pharmacology and end here... XD \nLove you Nile!
I like how they play around and prank each other without being mean about it, like they stopped Nile from actually licking the lotion they put on his hand lol. They seem like nice friends.
Any small youtubers wanna support each other
I do gymnastics and you and the British team are such an inspiration to me
i train at this training centre it's so cool knowing that you go there too!!💗🤸🏼‍♀️🤸🏼‍♀️
I'm in love with the new editing
You're nipples are so small it's cute.
I love u soooo much do u like Chris brown cause I loveee himmmm
Every video this guy uploads goes on trending page
Are you all picking on our Scottish commonwealth champion there? Just as well my mum doesn't watch you tube! She loves both Daniels!!
Be blindfolded and go through a obstacle course
Who here just to see his abs.No homo.
If I would have know that gymnastics is a bunch of hot-shirtless guys goofing off with one another, I would have joined when I was a kid.  To be young again!  You guys really seem to have fun.  Alright, I would not be piercing my ears, but the other stuff was great.\nbye\nBrennan
All of their accents XD
I should be doing my homework right now, but here I am.
Did anyone see his coaches smile get a little bigger when he started talking about the competition ❤️
In the challenge video you did with people on squad you never explained what the meaning of spinal and schmeagle was...?
jajajaja minute 0:37 jajaja wow sexy and hot and minute 2:01 his scream of very very woman jajaja
I love watching your videos and your edits are lit 🔥🔥😍😍
He's blowing up!!! One day I will get 100 subs and then blow up and laugh at myself
why is Nile single...well in his own words I can't find the hole  ;)  Great Video!
My mum said I went there and I came first in that competition like you did and got a big gold medal to
Your edits are definitely getting better!
Boo.  I really wanted to see them try to flip around blind folded...
Nile there's a picture on the wall at my school
And I know James hall he used to be my coach !!!!
Hi nile I am coming to lilishore or how ever you spell it with my coach because he is in a gym corse to the home of British gymnastics and I can't wait it's a corse or double backs have any pointers I hope you reply xox
I really like how your hair looks not styled like in the beginning of the video, not that I don't love it styled but I think you should leave it natural sometimes!!
hey nile i absolutely love yor videos i do gymnastics myself but you inspire me and i just want to say thank you you are just awesome
Love ur videos mate! Keep up the great work!
Sub if you think he is good
You're doing so well at the minute, all your vids are on trending! Keep up the good work

#9ontrending
Do a backbend
And I thought swimmers were jacked...
really fun video i loveedd itt!!!!!!
He kinda looks like DionYorkie
Eh...You're getting there.  💪🏾😂
YOU HIT TRENDING!!!!! Ily Nile
yes
WOOOOW :0
Random question: what hogwarts house would you think you'd be in?
what camera do you use?
Have you taken ballet?  You might investigate it, if not.  Bram Verhofstad moves like one, seems to actually slow time when he moves, it's thrilling to watch.  Somewhat like football player Lynn Swann, who was also a ballet student.  Your talent is so amazing, but it doesn't draw the eye in the same way.  Your movement could be not just thrilling, but breath-catchingly beautiful.
Hey nile , i've been watching your videos since couple months and i was wondering if i could have a good level in gymnastic considering i am starting at 17 years old.\nAnyway keep up the good work bro
I don't know why, but I'm like a solid 89% that Nile is gay, or at least bi.
Hey do you twist both ways in training or competitions? Im really only able to twist one way, kind of frustrating id like to see your take on it
Is he Scottish?
How tall are you? Nile
why not do the safer things with the blindfold. like handstand. swinging on the bar/rings with the foam blocks under it. or a blindfolded handstand walk race. with things on the side so you know you are going the right way.
ETA on restocking train smart t shirt?
Is coach Dave any good at gymnastics? You should do a video of you putting him through his paces 😁
Loving your video's Nile! They inspire me and put a smile on my face :) Was just wondering when the men's train smart, keep it real t-shirts will be back in stock? X
Were you using a cup as a blindfold???
R u going to the next commonwealth games If so I might see u there cause I'm going there great vid!!!
Have you ever tried the carmona on rings?
Nile do you ever go to tramp parks or are they too dangerous (or you don't have time)for a professional athlete? You guys could literally bounce off the walls there!
Star shoes looks cheap
Beautiful!! Your hair looks amazing!! ❤️❤️ Xx

What foundation are you wearing? Your skin looks great!
I absolutely love the silver shoes!!
Keep the shoes! End of discussion. :D
It doesn't really do anything. It just smells nice I swear they're gonna put that on my gravestone lol
I would not keep them, they're gorgeous, but so specific I wouldn't wear them over and over... I don't know, you go to much more events than I do hahahaha
Keep the star shoes. They're gorgeous! On the other hand, those Balenciaga boots look really pointy and weird, I feel like you could invest your money on something better😊
I always feel rude when I'm doing anything and they are working on my hair. I won't even touch my phone. And I feel like I have to make small talk with them. Thus I dread going to hairdresser! I actually hate it. I wish I could just cut my own hair if I could. But u seem to love it! So that's great!
Love the lace Self Portait skirt - want it need it! High street dupe pleeeeeeeeeease! ❤️
Love the Star shoes!!
is it .a new dog????? im sorry i hadnt watched Amelias channel for 2 or more yearsss
Do you ever find yourself copying your mom's styles and stealing some of her pieces? I LOVE HOW MY MOM DRESSES AHHH!!! (to be fair, my mom takes some of my clothes as well LOL)
KEEP THE STAR SHOES!!
The shaft/upper of the boots is so  flattering and hugs your legs, but I question why the toe box is so super pointy, but you wear many skirts and I could see you getting use/many wears out of them in especially fall/winter!
I loved this vlog ❤️ You're so natural in front of the camera!
You should show these to FleurDeForce.
@amelia keep the aquazura shoes there silver and goes with so much
Literally just gasped over the beauty of those star heels!!! KEEP THEM!!!!!!
Those boots are giving me such cruela de ville vibes!!!! Like I think those are the exact same 😳😬🙊

socks shoes are so ugly in my opinion!
Nay to the shoes
What is the song playing in 10.14??
Love those stars shoes! But I also love the Gucci shoes from you're mom! Love
Keep the stars, get rid of the sock boots
The star shoes are a must. Keep!!
I really dont like the balenciaga shoes... But the star ones look so cool!
No to the star shoe

Hello dear, looking amazing as usual..I love your watch can you tell me where you got it please? Thank you :) keep shining
OMG the thumbnail for this video had your hair looking that grey color so many are going and I was worried cause you are too warm for that.
I need to start wearing skirts more often gosh!!!
This was one of my favourite vlogs!!!
Loved,loved your vlog 😍😍and please do a house tour of your friends apartment. It looks like every girls dream. I am always confused of your house,do you have two kitchens?

Loving the Givenchy bag!! House tour please✋👌✋👌✋👌✋
Aww! Best wishes to Natasha!! She is always so sweet in your vlogs, over the years!! Xoxoxo 🙏🏼☺️🙌🏼💙
Your look so beautiful in this vlog, love your new hair, eye makeup without wing liner and that skirt, so pretty!
I love that depiboo took your hair darker for fall.... autumn?.... fall. Fall sounds better 😂 It looks incredible anyway, as does the tan skirt. The knife boots make me think of Devil Wears Prada and those star shoes though 😍😍😍
any small YouTubers want to be friends ?❤️❤️
Love you Amelia ;) Always great to see you sweet heart 💕And Loooove your new hair xxx
Love the shoes, dislike the boots. Your mom's so sweet.
I thought I spotted some pastel pink! Looks very beautiful!!
Okra and eggplant tray bake. Snap off the tips of okra, slice eggplant in half, brush with oil and bake! (Or roast, whatever)
Keep the star shoes!!!!!!
Oribe = Oar-bae  :)  According to my hairdresser when I pronounced it Oh-reeb.  I do wish you would feature your mother more.  She is more my demographic and I would to hear her beauty and hair tips.  I may have to start a letter writing campaign for her to start her own channel.
JonTron Video with 300,000 Views in 50 Minutes = Nowhere on the Trending Page\n50,000 Views in 2 Day = 17 On the Trending Page\n\nOut of curiosity, how much *does* is cost to bribe YouTube to be on the Trending Page?
The Aquazzuras are SUCH A KEEP! They're a classic silhouette with a fun twist. Love.
I feel like buying stuff online with the mindset of just being able to return isn't v considerate of yer carbon footprint and the environment. Just something to consider if you care!
Trump certainly did have the largest amount of viewers on a global basis if you count all the net livestreams
He doesn't have those stress lines in his face and dark bags under his eyes anymore. He looks relieved.
IF SOMEONE HAS BEEN DOING WORK - PAY THEM
cook terms lay cook note leg dig wrist wood.
Why did they film two piles of garbage for 8 minutes?
All politicians lie. The two parties are two sides of the same coin.
Disagreeing about facts does not make America great, for sure. Does Spicer for example believe that flat earthers make a relevant contribution? Gee!
i  love how stupid russian spam/phishing bots are, using the *.ru*   country code top-level domain for russia
Don't normalize Spicer. He worked for Trump!  I find him pathetic and I don't trust him.
Lmao...I don't think this fool realizes that he's no longer press sec.
i think im the only guy who doesnt support trump but i still like Spicer and Scaramucci or mafia guy.
how long does Stockholm syndrome last?
He speaks better than I thought.
I didn't know Spicer had a good sense of humor, it was good to see Spicer laugh about his former job now.  As much as I didn't like what Spicer was saying, if you watched the interview, you will understand his position.  He was doing his job of being Trump's voice to the press.  Even when he disagreed with the message, which he does indicate he wasn't always in sync with the message, he still delivered what Trump wanted to convey.  Now I kinda feel sorry for the guy, now wonder he was hiding in the bushes.
haha, when Sean Spicer claims to repeat something Donnie said and you know it's bullshit because it's a full sentence. 😁
Still an assworm\n Slime oozing out of my tv
I have a crush on Spicey. Omg he is soooo cute!
He was NOT elected. He was put into power by the electoral college not the people. Only the Popular vote should count!
Jimmy Kimmel treats the public like little dumb kids when repeatedly asked about the crowd at the inauguration. Yes Jimmy boy we'v got it from the first time!! All of you Hollywood liberal scam are easy to read before even you open your mouth!! Hollywood trash!
America was built on genocide, slavery, and colonialism. If you can rationalize that, you can rationalize anything. I think, sometimes, we can disagree with the facts. - Sean Spicer -
Why is the president so concerned with SIZE?
That is the problem w WH administrations, they are fine w lying because none of them actually have to own up to it. Spicey should not get fame. He should crawl back into the bushes forever.
Just because the president (or whoever) tells you to lie, you do not do it!!! It shows your character, not the president's. This is basic ethical behavior.
One of the biggest trumpturds ever right there
His employment exit agreement prohibits him from making disparaging remarks about the Orange one.
currently, we've saved the invisible hamster 9.7 million times
Still a slimy little weasel - my apologies to the real weasels which are actually pretty cute.
I believe the bottom line was he had a job, and he had to do what was necessary to keep it. But someone can only lie for so long about eating the chocolate cake when is in between the teeth and the fingernails
It's pretty cool that Sean Spicer decided to go on Kimmel's show! He had nothing to gain here, and he handled it great.
Fuggg Spicy..\nHe should go into hiding along with his\n  Alternative Facts \n          ...LLS..
He's alot more likeable as regular Sean Spicer, he seems happy!
Why is he on this ?????
is he looking at jail time?
So many new words!
Service to the country? I think he did the country a disservice. Lying to the people. Misguiding the public. I can't watch this. I'm out guys.
Oh America , this political lacing of all things TV is the end of you all . Try talking instead of labelling .
There goes America again blurring the lines again and making a celebrity out of a liar!
He survived one of the worst jobs ever. ... but I thought he was fired tho... 🤔
He helped spread the obvious lies of Trump and deceive the american people, he should be in prison and sentenced for life, not applauded when walking in to a talk show.
1+1=2 You can't disagree with FACTS.
those of us who worked hard to get him elected  Doesn't that sentence says a lot....? Trump didn't win because he was the best candidate but because people choose the lesser of 2 evil.\nI have ZERO respect for this man and all the others in the WH. They are all in there for their own GREED and corruption
Spicer seems like a good humble nice dude I give em two 👍🏼and a Victoria six pack of 🍻 spicee come watch the fight with us canelo putos!!!
its easy to sit here and scold spicer for sacrificing his integrity and spine the fact is, the situation is a lot more convoluted than that. Spicer took the job to further his political career; nobody could've predicted the SCOPE of the madness that the Trump presidency entailed. I don't think Spicer is AS despicable as Trump and most of his administration.
how ironic when spicer said he was honest with the american people and then said he would say whatever the liar and chief told him to, spicer is nothing but an empty suit who will do or say anything to get a big pay check.
So spicy what your saying is, when the orange baboon tells a lie it's your job to perpetuate that lie. Not a very honorable job to have.
He's gathering materials for a book, alright.
Good job Spicer. Jimmy doesn't know. His feelings are intact.
The joke is on us with this type of character.
Don't know how that jerk sleeps at night.
I don't think they allowed him to leave soo easily.
It *was* his job...
His Inauguration crowd was huge and a lot was blocked by protesters too, it wasn't easy to get in when it was really early.
Let's not....
fake news
I miss spicy 😢
Merica
this man is boring af
He needs to distance himself and call out the orange baboon if he wants to cleanse his soul and further his career prospects
Hi Jimmy!\nIf the crowd size was indeed sparse,\nIT'S BECAUSE POOR PEOPLE VOTED HIM IN AND POOR PEOPLE CANNOT AFORD TO MAKE ENDS MEET IN THEIR PERSONAL LIVES, LET ALONE HAVE ENOUGH TO TRAVEL TO D.C.\nAnd U, Jimmy, damn-well KNOW that TRUMP Is DAN, so how about getting Urself & The Rest Of The Late Night Hosts/ess (Samantha Bee) to START ACKNOWLEDGING THAT ELEPHANT-IN-THE-ROOM F_A_C_T.\n@PATRICIA_EROZ on Twitter
Don't you just miss the spicer lies
Jimmy should join the Skaggs from the View.
Jesus that suit is tight
I like Spicer he seems nice and genuine. He doesn't take it too seriously and can laugh about it
He was only in that position for a matter of weeks. Why are some acting like he had been in it for years? 😂😂😂
We all have free will...in the end.  Spicer sold his soul and is now trying to play the sympathy card.  You chose your path, Spicy.
It's good to see Sean Spicer smiling. I'm a democrat, but man I felt bad for him while he worked for Trump.
IM NOT AN REPUBLICAN OR CONSTERVIE BUT I THINK SEAN SPICER HAD THE WORST JOB EVER THANK FOR SERVING COUNRTY
He seems like a decent person outside of the White House
Facts are facts and aren't up for opinion or perspective. A blue sky is a blue sky. Saying it's red because that's your perspective means you're color blind, or just  lying.
Ha.
Spicy boi
Spicey has a funny laugh
Candid interview thank you!
Sometimes you have to disagree with facts  How does one disagree with facts??
Ass clown.  Sorry, disagree with the facts? Size of the inauguration is in dispute?
Let's face it, SPICY is not going to say anything really bad about ol' Scrotum neck till he's out of office.\nTHAT is when we'll get the juicy info & what Spicy REALLY thought of the current Groper in chief.
You ALWAYS have a choice of WHAT to say. The ''im supposed to voice what the president thinks'' argument is BS.
Suddenly alternative facts doesn't sound like an oxymoron because it's a matter of how you interpret something.
Trump is such a blatant liar. I don't know how Spicer can sleep at night.
Sean is very diplomatic but he's still full of sh.....t!
Poor spicey  I have so much more respect for him now. I bet he's so relieved he out of there now!!
Feel bad for him
Still dodging ...
GREAT!
Love My President!
He looks so haunted
Holy moly he got old
He is still shitty!
Spicer is funny AF 😂
Nothing's changed
this poor guy...
Yayyy! Spicey!
Awkward AF 😂
Scummy clown.
Spicer is still....Spicer. Ugh
sad
That frame rate though.
jimmy was just roasting him lol
Stop making assholes like this seem normal and nice.
Lies=Alternative Facts; welcome to the Trump world!
I love your accent, I need it as an app on my phone that delivers bad news cause it's so calming!\n\nI remember going to a conference once and they got 20 of us round in a circle to share ideas of how a certain idea could be improved. There was a girl using a BSL interpreter to communicate and the general lack of awareness from most of the group (although I'm sure they didn't mean it) was bothering me.\n\nIt was one of those conversations where one person would stop talking and then somebody would immediately jump on their point as soon as they stopped speaking and the combo of not knowing when to speak and trying to pay attention to her interpreter basically meant that this girl wasn't really getting a chance to say anything. At one point I managed to make an opening for her (Is there anything you'd like to add?) but it made me appreciate how difficult that situation must be when trying to get involved.
Hi dear, do you find it harder to lip-read foreigners, who don't usually talk English?
I feel like a convo between the two of us in any public place would be a comedic disaster 😂😂😂 With my autism, I get overwhelmed easily, can't separate background noise from conversations I'm in, and can get really spacey (it's actually a mild dissociation to protect myself). This also leads to me starting and not finishing sentences, suddenly forgetting I'm being spoken to, and completely losing track of a conversation 😬 I feel like our spouses would just be sitting there like what are they even doing?! Do THEY even know?! 😂
These were really great tips! (Also #12 made me giggle.  Tone is something that wouldn't have occured to me, but it makes total sense).
Also I'd like to say I love that you sign along in your videos. I've been wanting to learn BSL for so long and binge watching your channel has gotten me further than anything else so far!
Do you have a name sign Jessica?
gosh, youre so beautiful!! i love your style!!
Your voice is so down darn calming I love it
I'm getting major Dorothy (Wizard of Oz) vibes from this outfit! Loving it! ❤️  Also, I can't believe people actually do this stuff. But your reactions to their ignorance are great. especially the crutch example.
I love these tips so much, thank you for sharing! You are a doll! ❤️❤️
I am very lucky to not be fully deaf. I have moderate-profound hearing loss in my right ear and mild-moderate loss in my left ear. Its much lonelier than a lot of people realize. On my first day of college last week our tutor decided it would be a great idea to split us into pairs and talk to each other as a way to get to know other people in the class except when everyone was talking at the same time there was so much noise that I couldn't distinguish one voice from another and so I couldn't communicate with anyone. I was the loneliest person in that room. \nAlso I have almost become intolerant of people who insist on speaking to me softly even though they know I'm deaf and I'm already on my third 'what?'
You're an amazing person. Thank you for this incredibly informative video. It's really helpful and important!
Hi 👋🏻 Jessica that is really good things too know! I learnt a little sign language on a 10week course so I know a little but it's great to pick up signs from your videos too! Looking forward to your videos next week too! ☺️x
Thank you, Jessica, this is very helpful. Glad to know a notebook or cellphone might ease communication. Eye contact and heightened facial expression are good ideas. Can't believe some people 'test' your hearing by covering their lips - so rude.
Is it rude to tap deaf people on the shoulder to get their attention? I've just made friends with somebody who's deaf and wasn't sure whether that was the best way to involve her in a conversation when she's sat in her own world?
This is so incredibly useful! I especially appreciated the bit about it not being rude to pull out your phone and communicate that way if necessary. I might be hesitant to do that, afraid of offending someone, so it was good to know that you consider it perfectly fine. Also, I hadn't been aware that International Week of the Deaf was approaching, so thank you for drawing attention to it!
Plz plz plz check out my bsl videos it would mean the world to me I have a cover on my channel xx
I start my sign language class in two weeks and I can't wait!
Love all your videos! Relate so much to this... 5 is the worst, people will always whisper and ask if I can hear it. I have never thought of 9 but I always get a little sad after I have asked twice and they just give up. Like no I just can't hear you but I would love to know what you actually said having them use their phone will be very helpful.
Hello, I don't know any deaf people,  but useful things to know for when I do.\nIn other news,  my sponge rollers and lotta body arrived today. Tonight is the night. Wish me luck, I shall need it!! 😂💪🦄
I absolutely love your personality 😄
I say things in the wrong tone too and offend others without realizing it, but it's because I grew up in two different cultures. I also love some good gossip once in a while,  haha. I think you should make a video of some of these wrong tone incidences you've had in the past!
Does Claudia know how to sign, Jessica? If you don't mind me being cheeky...what is sign for the bog? 😜 Happy International Week of the Deaf!
Thank you so much for today's topic, can relate to every item you spoke of. I sometimes do so well acting hearing ( like you, I do the hearing behavior without thinking) people forget I don't hear, and if I do not hear them then they think I am not paying attention( grrrr). Someone knowing a few important signs is wonderful! I have a question -  When you speak a word incorrectly, do your hearing friends ever correct you? If so how do you respond to this? Thank you again for sharing your list.
Learning key signs and the alphabet goes a long way! I'm hearing but I'm learning ASL and I used to attend a deaf club where hearing people could go to practice with HOH and deaf people and knowing basics signs/the alphabet was a saving grace.\n\n(Also now, I'm learning BSL because of you!! 💙)
I love your videos! Growing up in had a friend (sarah) who was deaf and I got a basic sign language book and it was a great bonding experience with Sarah and she taught me games like writing a word on each other's back with our finger and guessing what the other wrote just by what we felt. I really learned a lot from her. I was in a sport with her and as we got older she moved away and life went on. Wish we had kept in touch. You are doing a great job educating people on what the world is like for you and how most of all you just want to be included. I hate that you get the some of the responses you do. But keep up the good work and I wish you and your wife all the best!!!!
Once again NZ is backwards to the rest of the world - our week of the deaf is in May. Im actually curious how you would deal with someone like me who stammers (or goes completely non-verbal at times) due to some of my mental health issues. Me and My ex used to spend a lot of time speaking through text because of it, and its why I started learning NZSL.
Your sass makes this video! I never thought to give facial expressions to my voice to express my tone or attitude. Very informative wonderful video!
Love your smile.
Great points 🌸🌹🌼
Great to know!!
This is so interesting, i wouldn't have thought of these things! At least now i know what to do when i meet someone who is deaf :) thanks!
I hoping to start my level 3 Signature course next month. Will have to be online as my local college only goes up to level 2. I'm in Cornwall and the closest 3 course is Bristol or Wales 😩
Great video Jessica. All I will add is that if people do some of the ruder points then I'm not sure I'd call them friends... I can't believe someone would actually cover their mouth for example and ask if you can hear them now! I suppose they're they same people who would take the mickey out of someone who stutters. 😕
This is really good for other people who have friends who are deaf or who work with them I've started my BSL level 1 and both teachers are deaf so these tips are going to be really helpful for when I'm communicating with them and any deaf people I meet xxx
I relate so much! I love your sassiness girl <3
Thank you for this video! As a spouse of a deaf person this covers a lot of what I am constantly telling other people about my hubby.
Typical brit problem; I can't tell when you're being sarcastic! Feel free to use your phone (you arse), yes please!.
The sound keeps cutting in and out and I don't know if there's an ironic issue with my phone or with YouTube or if it's part of the point of this video... 🤔
Been waiting for this video to drop, all the real fans know this song been out for a minute now. This goes in soo hard like  green day type vibe. MGK is a really talented artist unlike all these other lames out there who just be goin viral by using *Authentic Views com* to get they views up... smh
I know this guy from Roadies
Make up on my shirt mgk sneak dissin all the girls
mgk..... i really wish mgk ft Taylor in a song
It's so similar to Erase Me by Kid Cudi.
Possibly the best music video I've seen in my life
This literally makes me nostalgic I love this
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  \n\nFor with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  \n\nFor the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.\nRomans 10:9‭-‬11 KJV
I don't really like his music but this shit hard asf
He's better at singling than raping, didn't expect that
Am I the only person seeing comments about Green day but have no idea who they are ?
Thia is way different but loving it lace up
Mgk out here killing it as usual 💣
I’m sure I’ve heard that instrumental before
The rock part is what makes this song great. MGK making a name for himself.
I really liked the Song When He came out a while back. The Video on the other Hand Not so much
Im getting a Jonas Brothers vibe mixed with Viz Khalifa
Shout out to Cleveland, OH!!  \m/
This came out on my birthday 😭🙃
My Ohio boy finally made the music video. We Cleveland boys, who's from Cleveland like me
i love dis sooo much.... but i smell green day a bit here...😰\nbut still it's good

Mgk mgk mgk✌🏻
This needs some radio play!
This song's cool.!! Nice for broken hearted... Laceup!!

After watching those roast videos I expected gangster but boy I was wrong
This music sounds like teenage dirtbag of one d
Damn! I never knew he can sing this good!
is he really playing the guitar? This is awesome
Ay he can sing too, I had no idea lol.
MGk killed it with his unique style
That girl at 2:37 looks like the lovechild of Angelina Jolie and Katie McGrath
wht is this
When MGK rocking that safety pin makes me want to get pierced lol
Video of this song was expected to be romantic 😥
Are we in 2006 again
MGM is dope rapper

https://youtu.be/9Rw6hUBE4fY\nThis link is the best music video of the world ❤️
Love this song! Love this video! Love you Young Gun!!!
Mgk was str8 hip hop when he started out, as time has went on he has changed into some kind of punk rock\ hip hop artist, imo I only listen to the hip hop because I can't stand punk music...pick one or the other kells,
i loved the song but the video wasnt that good.. if it was something emotional id love that..
Love the song, Love the video and most importantly Love you all! I'm so proud of you guys and how far you have come! Keep being as awesome as you are...I'm one of your biggest fans and so honored to support you guys! Laced up for life ✌️
Mgk has changed 🤔🤔 and i dig it. New and inproved green day
What is The sample please?
This shits corny, mgk out here sounding like one direction or the Jonas brothers. Video is wack too. I miss old MGK
I hope this music video blows up
To me this makes me think of Weezer! Brings back great memories! Lol
i love this song .! hes the only person i listen to on a daily basis man, hes got me through alot of shit.
is it just me or he looks like luke 5sos in here...
How about.. Kanye & ... can't remember the guys name.. but Erase me

OMG KELS
GAAAAHHHHHHHHHHGAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHSORRY I GET SO EXCITED
This is so sad 😂
Kinda sounds like avril lavigne type of music from mid 2000s
Wtf is this? Obviously copying Jake Paul\nNice way to get the views
nothing at all wrong with white pride, we aren't going to be told to be ashamed of being white
Hey Trump supporters, we know reading is hard but the blank says Add a Public Comment not Add a Pathetic Comment.
Is this comedy, or a Democrat campaign?
No promises re: punching people in the face.
Ok, so how did White Extremism become a thing in the Pacific North West? I thought that the PNW was a Bastion of Progressive Culture. I was taught that Racism was a Southern thing. Is that not true? Is it possible that there are Northern States that are more racist than the South? Shut my mouth and call me cornpone!
I hate full frontal, it leaves nothing to the imagination.
Does anyone realize that Oregon is so liberal that you can't even fill a vehicle gas tank yourself? you have to have a trained gas attendant.
I want to see what criteria the use to say their have only been 6 left terror attacks I guess antifa doesn't count cause I personally can name more than 6 also didn't a left wing nut job just shoot a bunch of Republicans was that 1 of the 6
Where is the documentation, proof, studies, polls, records, etc... that white supremacist groups are the most violent? Have you ever heard of Islam, Antifa, BLM... Both sides have done horrible atrocities but to constantly blame white people is not factual.
Stock!!!\nStereograms of Wealth. \nMatrix of Wealth. \nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/MagicWorldMira\nBuy One Stereogram.\nGet 3 Stereograms in Gift.\nStereograms to order.\nPersonalized stereograms.
Ok so what happens when this former neonazi loses their job or their girlfriend leaves them? I feel like a plan that rotates around making sure white guys never suffer any hardship is not the most long term thing I've ever seen.
But not to proud, that's what got us here in the first place. Oh I fell over laughing 😂
So 2900 americans dead 9 11 by muslims dont count?
When you feel more self-confident there's no one to blame anymore. Such a true and great quote which is the solution to envy and jealousy, I seriously needed that to start my day.
...So out of touch. ...So smug and self-satisfied... *_I don't understand why Hillary lost_*
The left IS racist AND fascist. They think other races NEED white people to SAVE them and want to control them to submit like pets. The left is racist and fascist!
love cannot exist without hate and hate cannot exist without love
samanthabee.com/lifeafterhate  - link at the end of the episode.
Just had a terrorist attack, but WHITE SUPWEMACISTSSTST!
I'm glad to see a beautiful African american woman fight white supremacy
I'm sure the 1k dislikes didn't watch the show😐\n #LifeAfterHate 😁
most of the facts she pulls from are just provably wrong so I cant even begin to criticize the points shes making
I support the goals of Life After Hate, but the white guilt in this video is kind of nauseating.
that's insane they gutted funding wow
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
The dreamers & Medicare for all please watch https://youtu.be/XRnOdnWtQbc
I would love to meet former white supremacists. I mean that very genuinely. I just want to sit and have a conversation.
Lack of love distorts people, and love is the cure for all evil.
There are black racists, BLM, and white racists, Neos, and brown racists, La Raza.  There will be hate groups...best to join Christians United and promote love.
Useful stuff. \nHonestly I've got mixed feelings on the issue, I think groups like Life After Hate are incredibly useful and important and good. \nAt the same time, plenty of bigots are incredibly violent and dangerous and many have gotten into positions of power and will use that to hurt people, so people do, I feel, have to be willing to rebel or fight back against violence and injustice as well. \nThere's no single perfect solution sadly.
I'll stop punching nazis when they stop threatening me with death.
Magic video!
ANTIFA?
I just can't like this girl....
More dislikes than comments.. and this is considered trending?
WATCH THE GREATEST STORY NEVER TOLD FOR TRUTH!@!
Camilo sesto
Good going sam!
:)
troubled waif......a worrying woman's woman.
She has awesome hand movements.
#Hillaryforprison
Great interviews Sam.
join interracially against racism on facebook
Sam is so awesome
LOVE!
Samantha Bee for president!
I truly pity anyone that regularly watches Samatha Bee. You cant be saved at this point.
But where are these terrorists attacks? Where are the reports? Deaths? Injuries? There are constant reports of attacks from leftwing radicals, constant reports of attacks from radical islamists, constant reports of attacks in places like the Philippines from religious radicals.
Don't you have some cancer patient to mock?
What an evil hag. Why does she get a show?
The propaganda is real.
🏳☮🏳 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLQ_h2kdt0U    PEACE SONG PROJECT, YOU ALSO WATCH AND SHARE, DO SOMETHİNG FOR PEACE... 🏳☮🏳
I'm proud to be white.
Yeah I too dislike those terrorists that dress all black and destroy Berkley... oh wait
Why won't she ever bring up statistics in her propaganda ? Come on Samantha you are on the right side of history. Just talk about the statistics lol. \n\n\n\n\nOh wait. She literally can't.
I love all the links to the studys shes getting all of the numbers from
Hey it's not racist if your black and hate white people, it's only white people who are even capable of racism.\n\nHerrrrrr durrrrr...
What about the terrorists on the left beating people and damaging property.
Sam - flies like a butterfly, stings like a Bee!
keep punching nazis
Hate towards cancer patients 🤔
unfunny
Choke on a bowl of dicks.
Hahahahahahaha \nFakenews \nAmericans are not nearly as racist as we are portrayed by fakenews.
I really hate this woman... white pride is fabricated... I'm white and know white people and don't hear anything about racist thoughts...the terrorists are the left fuckwads that attack people randomly
More Alt-Left propaganda... 👎🏿
Meanwhile in Europe...
Genuinely curious if Samantha has done a show on brown nationalism or Islamic supremacy? If one attack in America killing a white person can spark this kind of content then hundreds of attacks by one group, there has to be at least one video. If there is let me know I'd love to watch it and see if I can donate to ending hate towards whites.
Thank you Sam for pointing out the blatantly obvious to anyone who can do a google search on terrorism in the USA. People should already know this, but we have to be led by a comedian to actually look at the facts and statistics.
Talking about brainwashed america liberals have destroyed this world
I think we can all agree that Oregon is a terrible place where you can't even pump your own gas.
Am I supposed to give her my movie ticket?
Why aren't whites allowed to be proud of who we are? Every race has and had bad people, why does every white person have to be held accountable for it?
What about the violent leftists terrorists at Berkeley? Didn't one just stab a woman in the neck because they disagreed with her? You know, the left that's been rioting and sending death threats to a Jew......acting like nazis.
You know if someone wold say the mojordy of the tarist are black it's racist then if you say the same about white people it's not then oh wait that means ur still racist to White people wich we come to the hidden Truth this Sam is racist.
Samantha, now do you see why Trump is POTUS?\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFUIVfKTeVg&list=PLrEnWoR732-BHrPp_Pm8_VleD68f9s14-&index=1
1k dislikes?.. Keep going with this stuff Sam clearly we still have a problem..
The Nazis of the past were definitely a threat. The Nazis of today, not so much.. They can't even bring proper torches out for a mob, which says a lot about how defanged they are.\n\nThat being said, punching them isn't gonna accomplish nothing. Remember the words of Dr. King Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that. For all of you advocating for punching Nazis, I a black man ask you this, has that made less riots and civil disturbances occur less across the nation? Have you truly succeed?
Those pesky christians blowing people up
Trump is a white supremacist racist, just like his white hooded daddy.  End of story.
95% blacks are Savage animals deserve to be put in zoos They ruin schools communities raping pillaging and murdering  basically a walking talking disease like cancer
Oy vey goyim support non-whites  and have  multiracial children.
You have a nasty attitude. I can't wait until you ruin your own career. \n\nAnd Trump WON!!!!!
The title should be changed to Life after Modern-Day Liberals. It's essentially the same thing.
You know how to not solve the problem people? By alienating white males... It's not like they are the one group you need to be working with to come together. It's only going to fuel more racism but keep it up guys let's drag everyone back 60 years to make yourselves feel better about Trump being president. We need to stop awarding people for playing victim or else why would anyone want to change (Hollywood).
Of course YouTube trends more leftist propaganda, you're not even trying anymore Sam, you're just making entire segments out of Salon and HuffPost articles, but your viewers have such cognitive dissonance they don't even care! They're worse than 45 supporters.
I wish BLM supporters would start coming out of the hate closet too.
Nice! Now call out the BLM supramicists and Communist Antifa...oh wait..
It's embarrassing that YouTube puts this as trending with barely 200k views.
What's wrong with you people? All Samantha spews is hate!
White supremacy isn't a problem here in America and if you think it is you're lagging behind the rest of us
*THIS IS ALT-LEFT PROPAGANDA*
Marxist authoritarian trash.
Boycott Samantha bee. She's a vile screeching cow who blatantly lies and has been coughs lying in almost every episode. Do not trust her for any entertainment or news.
No, you should definitely punch Nazis. That's what our grandpas did in Europe and that's what we should do here.
Classic racist garbage. Thanks for nothin Samantha Bee. Talk about both sides. AKA BLM. -I hate white supremacists, I hate black supremacists.
Yet Soros funded haters cannot let go.
You are intellectually dishonest
Pure propaganda. Sad faggots who watch this
It's a child. There is no place for hatred here.\n\n\nYou people are disgusting.
Why is this trending?
They are removing dislikes
These two are so cute together. Beautiful family.
What's the problem with race mixing? Like any of us are a 100 percent one race anyway. Just do a simple ancestry DNA test, and your results might surprise you. All the racists in the comments could be 20% of the race the they hate, and they'd never know 🤷🏾‍♀️
Awww....I'm so happy for them!!!
How to ensure your child gets bullied
Why do Italians put they're trash in clear trash bags?\n\n\nSo Puerto Rican's can go window shopping.
most beautiful couple and baby i cry. i cryin
So you call them your name? Really? That's almost a disgrace.
As someone who is mixed I am actually shocked some people in the comments can be this ignorent
Can someone please tell me why this video has so many views?
If she is a feminist...
I'm just gonna watch it again
There is officially more comments saying stop being racist than ones that are racist
Category: Science & Technology\n\nWtf has this got to do with science or technology? ...
Word of life Las Vegas and the police and a neighborhood of men sex trafficked me
Really people, there's so much video like these and bunch of people saying omg aw this is the best video! And omg best family! Really what the heck, really people.
Another super tennis player is born for sure!!
All you people need to get a life. Like focusing on your lives and not some other celebrity or another athlete that comes and goes.
You should name her Adagio.
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
This isn't my fucking bag Get the fuck out of here
What is wrong with you guys?! Why would you dislike this
The 4K that disliked this are people who were going to like but accidentally pressed the dislike button and didn't realise
Who are these people, what so good about this vid?
Who are these people
your daughter is a mutt
...for fucks sake, a stiff throbbing cock enters a hot moist cunt, then splatters a load of thick sticky cum all over the pussy walls, and you get this...
Anybody who calls their kid ______ _______ Jr. is just a cruel parent in my eyes.
I was wondering why this was trending then I realised, Oh my God, it's Serena Williams!\nCongratulations to the new family ❤️❤️❤️
Who are these people?
I'm a real nigga or nigger lol 😁
Before you people say white racist try to look more into these people if you dig deep enough you will find that a lot of these profiles are in fact black racists or even Asians trying to pretend to be white to frame them.
this is cute and all but why is it on trending that's for actually popular videos
Awwww.......I give this marriage 8 years.
Serena Williams = cute \nAlexis ohanian = cute \nRelationship = cute \npuppies = cute \nAlexis Olympia ohanian Jr. = cute\nfamily = fucking cute \n\nguys they are the cutest family ever
Omg she is beautiful!!!
Magic video!

Hi
Irma gerd.
HelloThere
https://youtu.be/Q1fPWcmYnyE
Popcorn tastes good.
This is so presh ❤️
Congratulations!
Congratulations, guys. 💞 🎾🎾🖱🖱
So?
Why is this trending?
This is fucking beautiful life being created, happiness existing, but why do y'all got to be so damn fucking aggressive damn like is there any actual reason to hate besides the fact that you want attention, or to troll, or because you were raised to see this as wrong, every one dislikes something but there's no need to be aggressive about it and blowing up the comment section doesn't help when the comment you make has been stated fifteen times already
Ew, race mixing.
Im gonna sell her on redit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJk xD
Mixed breed, I suggest you take it out and kill it.
Sis it's a coon with a white!!disgusting
damn that name is shitty as fuck
Hahahahaha men can't have babies!! Lying to the world. Salvation is coming, he's the only one who gives children and I bet he didn't give you any! Liars and their moon bumps hahahahaha
I'm surprised it didn't come out with a penis considering how much anabolics the momma monkey does.
Lol its gonna be a mixed race cofee colour piece of shit
Grossssssssssss
Disgusting race mixing
We've got another black Nigger monkey for mind training, just like Ghettogagger.com 😊
Nigger
N I G G E R
Too bad the baby's half a nigger
Gross.
People who care about skin colour confuse me. Such a pointless thing to care about. It's just such a childish thing.
yo she iss sooo phucking ugly yo
Omg idk you guys but this is the sweetest video ever. You can see the love between them. Happy for them❣️ what a beautiful couple💗💗
Congratulations Serena and Alexis on your bundle of joy.. She is beautiful.. Can't wait to see your wedding
I'm sick of all these mfkr chimps
He named a girl after him that's weird
One question.........Who are these people? (No offense i don't have socail media)
This had thumbnail of reddit...has nothing to do with reddit *DISLIKES*
How could you make a baby with her? I mean, she is famous yes, but ugly af.
Race mixed
YES! The Earth is FLAT.
Stop fucking nigger people. We don't need more in this world.
Why tf does the thumbnail have Reddit people on it
I'm not getting what the big deal is here.  Are not 95% of couples equally ecstatic about their pregnancy?  Are either of these parents-to-be celebrities?  If so, how?  What exactly is the hullabaloo about this couple?
Is that Serena Williams?
I'm seeing a bunch of comments about racist comments but I'm not seeing any racist comments rn
Beautiful
Darkness everywhere...
Nigger
You fucking cuck ass bitch.
baby nigger
Dirty fucking race mixer
Ugly mix race baby
God damn race mixing, man. This world is going to shit.
How can a man and a gorilla have a baby?
Oh boy, more multiculturalism. \nNo thank you, Disney.
How could pixar of all people made a completely unoriginal story
Wow I can't wait for the book of life 2
#♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥♥  #♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥  #♥♥♥♥\n*Jesus Christ is the Son of God & promises you eternal life if you simply believe Him.*\n*He promised to also heal your body.   (Just ask Him)*
My grandmother was exactly like that according to my mom.  She can be brutal as all hell if you got on her bad side.
Book of life but with a kid and a dog
To all those comparing this to Book of Life:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX7bfDT_Yok
Who else has ever tuned a guitar with a pair of pliers?
I can already tell this is going to be one of their lowest rating films ever!
This is just like book of life! They even have the same concept of being forgoten and being lost
I can't wait for this movie it looks so good !
when there is nobody left in the living world to remember you, you disappear well dang
Ugh this is such a blantant ripoff of monsters inc.
I wasn't expecting they use Bittersweet Symphony for the trailer.
They're remastering the book of life already?
This really reminded me of that other movie book of life
What in the world is that multi color panther thing supposed to be?
This..... movie better break records and CRUSH the box office DO YOU HEAR ME!? this better be as good as their old greeaaat  no AMAZING movies,..................................................................................................................................................................and Pixar pleeeease I beg of thee don't screw this up.
YEAH THERE IS NO WAY SKELETON HAVE A NOSE LIKE THAT _)@
0:04 the momment you do something and somebody into Your room ( bad english sorry )
I really liked Book of Life, this one looks promising as well!
The next level of book of life movie
Kubo 2?
Can't wait to see COCO😂😀 n hey. Whatch out for the chancla😂😁😘😘
The kid probably is gonna be transgender 🙄
I just want to know what song is playing in the background of this trailer. I feel like I know it / recognize it, but I can't put my finger on it.
My god Pixar, I mean this is gorgeous. Every Pixar film is amazing or at least decent (Accept Cars 2) but my god this takes animation to a whole new level I'm mostly excited for Pixars coco there first musical.
I'm excited to watch the movie
Wasn't the main character from book of life also not allowed to play music even though he wanted to?
there should be cholos in this movie
I AM H Y P E ABOUT THIS LATINO/A REPRESENTATION
But like...\nWhy do disney mkvies stick to the formula of a young character wanting to be/do something and then having their parents stop that goal in the first act, but are then redeemed in the second or third act; where the parents reveal thry do it out of love? Moana did this with her not being allowed to explore, brave did this with merida wantibg to not be a princess, mulan the same thing, nemo wanting to explore ect. I like how this has a spirited away thing going on (though not wholly otiginal either (corpse bride))
Visually this movie looks beautiful. I might go see it.
Pixar's First Movie Musical. Can't wait!!!
Looks like a beautiful movie
I hope they make bendy and the ink machine the movie
Two movies take place in Japan\n*People say nothing*\n\nTwo place take place in Mexico\n*IT'S JUST LIKE BOOK OF LIFE!!!*
Sooo if you disappear once no one remembers you, does that mean Hitler would live forever? Because he's going to be in history books for a long time....
I only hope this lives up to its predecessor: The Book of Life
The first time I've seen a xoloitzcuintli in a movie
Finally a Coco comment section that ISN'T full of BoL fans calling it a ripoff.\nEdit:  nvm apparently people still think it's a ripoff
That dog makes me lose my bejeezers
When does this take place?
Damn the book of life 2 looks
It seems that they changed the music to appeal to American audiences. The previous trailers had Mariachi music and now this one has The Vervepipe. More people should learn to appreciate music from different cultures.
Marco is that you?
Looks an awful lot like Book of Life. Like, a LOT. I seriously doubt Pixar are not aware of this.
Looks like a great movie!  Can't wait to see it!  I just hope Disney doesn't turn it into a ride, because it will probably make a horrible ride.
This looks really good. Buuuut it also looks really similar to the Book of Life so yeah. I think the only way I can feel confident in judging if it's copying that one is if I watch them both, so I'll definitely be watching this movie.
Can you have camila cabello singing a song
I see Pixar\nMy heart fills with happiness
Cool! Just come to the US legally and we will have no problem whatsoever :)
Is this book of life 2? Lol
Also is that an alibreje creature? Awesome just like in Legend quest
I see a strange similarity between this movie and The Book Of Life.
Oh god another musical... Thank god I don't have kids so I won't be forced to watch this.
It has uncanny resemblance with The Book of Life.
Amazing, just amazing. Pixar always does a great job. This ain't an exception.
This film is definitely going to win an oscar next year
Book of life was a good movie. And they know that.
Now Disney will get rich off Mexican culture
My Sunday school teacher is an animator for Pixar and has been working on this movie. I can't wait to see it.
What a nice advertisement for the book of life!!
Can I just say I am grateful my mother hasn't hit me with a chancla yet, she has about five pairs sitting on a rack...
Can't wait for book of life 2, though..This one has a lot less style. Hmm..
This looks really cute, but the storyline is cliche. Some kid wants to follow his forbidden dream, goes on a journey, proves to his family that his dream is actually good, etc. etc.
The book of life?
Is this supposed to be a Disney/Pixar Book of Life version kinda thing
*Comment complaining about a comment that doesn't exist*
I AGREE WITH THE YOUTUBE-LIKERS, I WANT TO SEE THAT MOVIE CALLED: DISNEY PIXAR COCO THE 2017 COMEDY MOVIE TOO!!!!!!!    :-D
Book of life 2 looks great

So this is the short that plays after Frozen 2: Olaf's Big Adventure?
Does Disney do any films about black people?
damn, disney is really starting to lose it's charm, they're getting more generic and unoriginal by the years
Jesus loves you so much and that love he has for you is overwhelming and is like your the only person in all existence that he loves. I'm taking prayer request and if you have questions about God I'm here. I know this video isn't about God but I wrote this in the hope I'll help someone. I'm not trying to push or force my faith on anyone, It's just a friendly offering. Also I have a video called God loves all:message, if your interested. God bless you and have a great rest of your year!:)
Isn't it pretty much a copy of the book of life but in more modern times
she had a lucky escape.....<3
Been waiting for you....\nWhere the white mustang ?
Horrible. Such talent, yet keeps putting our dreck. I don't get it
What about with the get free song in the 3:29 minute? ❤️

I want to roll myself into a little ball and live in lanas vagina
I was awakened, I was sent to heaven, I saw God Del Rey, I am reborn
I was waiting for her to sit on that guys face
The guy is gorgeous! Who is he?

You were so obsessed with writing the next best American record. You did it all for fame. You did it all for fame.... tell me how life treats you now?
Packing all my things for the summer\nLying on my bed it's a bummer\nCause I didn't call when I got your number\nBut I liked you a lot\nSlippin' on my dress in soft filters\nEverybody said you're a killer, but I\nCouldn't stop the way I was feeling that day\nYour record dropped\n\nThe day I saw your white Mustang\nYour white Mustang\nThe day I saw your white Mustang\nYour white Mustang\n\nCaught up in my dreams and forgetting\nI've been acting like Armageddon 'cause you\nHeld me in your arms just a little too tight\nThat's what I thought\nSummer's meant for loving and leaving\nI was such a fool for believing that you\nCould change all the ways you've been living\nBut you just couldn't stop\n\nThe day I saw your white Mustang\nYour white Mustang\nThe day I saw your white Mustang\nYour white Mustang\n\nYou're revving and revving and revving it up\nAnd the sound, it was frightening\nAnd you were getting a part of that\nYou gonna hit me like a lightning\n\nWhite Mustang\nYour white Mustang\nThe day I saw your white Mustang\nSaid you're a wild Mustang\n\nYou gonna hit me like a lightning\nYou gonna hit me like a lightning
she looks like and elderly woman wearing a young womans skin
your voice is beautiful but your songs sound the same...I can come back 4 years from now (like I have lol) and your songs are virtually the same
Omg I'm freaking out this realised on my birthday and I didn't even notice. I didn't get anything for my birthday just a cake
I thought it's (your wife must stay) 😂
********\nThis song is about Lana's latest scandal with producer G Easy, \nthey were somewhat dating, he begged her to sing in his new song, she refused (no wonder, that guy's music sucks) \nso he replaced her with Halsey (eeek). \nThe point of the video is, she knew and knows her worth, liking him yet pushing him away in the end.\n**That guy's known for singing about expensive cars he owns (name of the song Mustang) and leather jackets (similar outfit as the guy in the vid).
From the heart so deep makes you realize your alive
Lana Del Rey's voice is like a water- calm, relaxing, deep.
I love you Lana
Lana del Rey is on top of the world.  No one else is like her.  It's refreshing in a world full of copycats.
Her vintage style..  Her melancholic voice..\nMake her a peace of art~~
i love the entire song but the part with the whistling is so delightful, every time

the whiite muustaang
I really don't understand this song and it's one I don't like, so sorry, and the car she's driving in the tunnel is a Studebaker  Advanti, this song doesn't make sense & I don't care for the music... I Love Lana & she's mostly all I play everyday ! I thought the  Lust for Life  cd was going to be so much better than it is and I hate saying that !!!! She's still the bestest  \n, lean in for a big kiss 😘

BEAUTIFUL HAUNTINGLY BEAUTIFUL
There aint no mustang in the video, why?\n :c
HELLA ASS BITCH CLICKBAIT ASS ASSHOLE,WHERE THE FUCK IS THAT GODLY MUSTANG GT
1:55 sounds like the song was written in 90's - early 00's
The cars in this video are a Studebaker Avanti and a Volvo P1800. Neither are white mustangs.
The guy looks so much younger than her.
Lana I love you beyond measure...I swear I dream of you at night
That video is a pure art I love it 😍
Mom❤️
Love the song since the intro started
love you lana! you rock!
drive me crazy about her eye, her mouth,her gesture . Anyone else help me ?
I've never been so jealous of a car.
watch?v=ANHldUFHUGI
I don't think this video fits this song (and I believe Best American Record would be a better match), But I LOVE this song so much!  Summer's meant for loving and leaving. I was such a fool for believing that you could change all the ways you've been living, but you just couldn't stop.
Her voice is just so beautiful and calm. Love u Lana S2

Did u know,  the Introvert people have different taste for music.  I think this the answer...  Her music i think dedicated for introvert.  That why this not really popular..  But however,  if u like this music,  ur taste is good...  U know what u really like,  more than taylor swift music.... Soon or later,  they will know  how best this music..

Terrorist attack? Time for the left to blame trump for ALL of his tweets.
so many alleged terrorist attacks and none is solved. That shows how fragile The U.K. is. This looks like fire drill emergency response exercise.
GAS CHAMBERS TO ALL MUSLIMS!
dumb trump didn't tweet about the white kid with the gun who attacked his school and shot 6 people he didn't call him a terrorist
haters of Islam always remember : your peace is inside your grave.
Trump saying loser makes me think of a 10 year old kid...
I'm seeing a lot of hate towards the hateful. Stay safe London. Love, Johnny.
I'm honestly starting to think this was just a bunch of kids lighting shit on fire on the train.
need more migrants to England. this is god's way of punishing England for the many sins of the Beattles !   gods wrath us upon England for the Beattles satanic music clearly heard , satan is god  when played backwards at 45 rpm !!!!
These goat fuckers can't even create a proper bomb 😂
I live in the uk and its so sad how people find out the news and just say aw its just another terror attack like its normal
Calling any Muslim Muslim is too flattering for that word means to submit to God. That's an insult to God himself. I prefer to call them Mohammedan.
the bomb might just be a lure.. and the person who made the bomb built it to not fully explode,to fail.
It was the British government that supported the terrorists in Syria ... This is the result of their support😡😡😡😡
Lol police won't investigate anything, because this whole hoax was staged with their complacency.
It's a gallon bucket and a tiny fire, fucking incompetent terrorist but how were people even injured? Either way the device seems more or less intact so good for forensics.
Kick all the brown people out of Britain. Or kill them.
Europe & UK government just don't understand this is just the beginning so why don't y'all bring in more unvetted immigrants !!!
i can't believe josh johnson bombed the subway!
Just shows the stupidity of modern day humans. Yeah lets go up and stare through the window at the flaming improvised explosive.
Ohhh, that woman's legs are burned so badly 😣. She must be in so much pain, her skin is just peeling off completely 😟. I hope that she and all others injured are able to recover okay.
Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslim.
Women need to be taken out of politics
God, how terrible, when will this insanity end??\nIt would seem that no one is safe, anywhere. No words. Thank God no lives were lost...
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
Part & parcel, y'all. Just part & parcel
Okay abc news since cnn is not reporting YOU'RE taking the hit. Now US military blow up civilians overseas but is not reported. There are numerous REAL terrorist attacks that go unreported. Sheeple claim they need evidence to prove that these are psyops but I need evidence to prove that it was real other than reporters saying so fake witnesses and police and emts everywhere. Now you can fool millions but I know that this is another psyop to invoke fear and control. I don't care about responses because this message is for abc.
Fuvking Pakistani fucks wreaking havoc against fucking civilians again
Wow in Islamic State of London? It's not Great Britain no more. Well it's ur government that allowed this.  Attacks will be imminent. Idiots.
I don't think the main objective of the  bomb was to hurt people if they wanted to they could have done it way better
This is some Blacklist type shit
Why is it happening to us Brits?  What did the world do to make it un safe for innocent people to get to work/other places and get attacked?
Officials will wring their hands and write a sternly worded email  to ISIS.  Instead they should pull the hate spewing imams out of the mosques by their scraggly beards and deport!!!
How do we know they are Muslim?
Where was David Duke? \n\n🤔
They will magically find a passport or know where he is hiding
This alleged terror attack is a FAKE STAGED HOAX DRILL committed by the Government & reported by the corrupt complicit mainstream media as a real event. Crisis actors used as victims & eye witnesses. ALL terror attacks in UK have been staged by the UK Government, used to implement new laws to remove your freedom & privacy, to instill fear, divide people & now they're going after free speech via censorship of the internet. Government trying to shut up anyone that goes against their bullshit lies & actions. The Government are the terrorist using psychological terrorism against it's own people.
I'm all for a safe homeland, but what a crock of shit from the parliament/media. This is probably one of the laziest attempts I've ever seen. That being said I'm glad everyone is okay.
No life threatening injuries just like your natural disasters blueye british pigs. Is it the snap crackle pop navy or is it in concert with the USA military?
No worries, only liberal loving Brits hurt, you know the ones that love the terrorists to death and want more in. Just do the usual candle vigils, holding signs of peace, toleranance, and hug it out like usual and move on already. We're just waiting for the next one to happen as usual. Like having a bad cold and wondering why it isn't being cured because you keep taking in antibiotics.
Kick them all out!!!! How many more?!
I am hoping that the world will come to realize that Islam is not a religion but a Demonic Cult of War, Conquest and Deceit. Islam and Muslims need to be kicked out of Europe AGAIN.
Let me help you guys solving this case. Whoever did this was not a Boy Scout, nor a Japanese tourist, nor a Buddhist monk, nor a polish immigrant, nor a born again Christian, nor a vegetarian... I hope I have helped some.
Why are these attacks happening? The UK did not abduct Muslims into the UK, as Americans did to Africans. Muslims themselves wanted to live in the UK, probably because they thought the UK was a better place to live than their Muslim country, and the UK welcomed them and provided them place to live.\n\nShouldn't the UK be their second motherland, if not the first? Why attack the nation that helped them? If they want the UK to become more like their original Muslim country, why not go back there? Then, they can have the strict Muslim way of living without terrorism.
Fear-mongering and it's part of living in a big city. Can you guest the idiots whom said this?\nHint: Ones a over used tea bag
*Look out dudes! Religion of blast you to pieces.....i mean, very very peaceful, coming through!*
What's to investigate? It's the damn muslims once again. The Religion of pieces.
All in the name of acceptance and equality
Ohh islam...again
A BUCKET BOMB? WTF!
Hope they are alright..
Glad no one lost lifes
Did isis  did this
nh
Fucking greenscreen on george. Hes not in london...
BRITAIN BELONGS TO WHITE PEOPLE.
Death to Chocolate Pudding faced people !
this is what happens when you disarm your citizens they dont pull these pussy attacks in the states every other week
Why was George Stephanopoulos in london?
Here we go again.
so.....how is that open door policy for Muslims working out...?
Colonial rule.
Magic video!
According to liberals: There are no terrorist...
Sadik Kahn orders you to get used to it!\nYou deserve such a mayor!
Damn London is way to dangerous
Another terrorist attack the world is going to forget within 48h. A world ran by retards.
You know the smell of burning *FLESH*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe police are coming so I have to go now 3:42
Radical islamic terrorism a culture in UK
According to Sadiq Khan, Muslim mayor of London, this is just everyday life in a big city. True. A big city in some Islamic shithole country teeming with subhuman, stinking, violent Muslims. I remember a family vacation to London in the early 1970s. Then it was actually full of courteous, civilized white Britons. I was there a second time again early this summer, and large parts of it are so rancid and violent with Muslims those areas should be leveled, the Muslims repatriated to whatever Islamic death cult cesspool they crawled out of, and the areas vacated populated by white Britons once again.
EVERY sharia-law-lover is a soon to be terrorist. KILL them all.
In my opinion every available resource on earth should be used to exterminate all radical Muslim terrorists.
The Muslim phobic comments are awful. How do you even know who did this? Even if it was a Muslim the majority are not like you think
Islam is to blame. If you're a Muslim and you can't recognize how false and violent your religion is, I don't want you in my country! Get out right now. We are going to start making it uncomfortable for you otherwise.
I just can *not* wait to dive in to all the delightful comments! Yay, I get to learn 42 new cuss words! Oh! Is that hate on Muslims? Terrific!
Forget about banning the burqa. Ban Islam.
Liberalism KILLS.\n\nFind a cure!
Was it Buddhist?
OUR SPECIES ARE GETTING AWFUL EVERYDAY
Damn white Christians
Hahaha everyone talk about Muslims 😂😂😂 lool
Another day in Londondistan
Damn Buddhists - again!
If there was an explosion then how was the bag and bucket it was in almost fully intact and barely on fire? And why was George Stephanopoulos in London? Was he there to cover another story or did he just happen to be there today? Hmm...
Know Muslims, No Peace.\nNo Muslims, Know Peace.
ALAHU AKBAR\nALAHU AKBAR\nALAHU AKBAR
All this crap since we were dragged into a phoney war with Iraq based on Lies lies and more lies.
This comment is a controversial opinion and will start a reply war.
If you don't address that attacks like this are created by the whites behind the curtain, you will never ever be able to solve the issue. Addressing the root cause is the key.
White people are the real terrorists
The Mighty Lion of Juda...Will Eradicate Islam Forever
It's the religion of peace, nothing new....
Religion of peace strikes again

I wonder what it feels like to poop after eating all that
I challenge @mattstonie to attempt and win the  14 lb burger challenge
You got the munchies That's why you are Matt Stonie
I watch the girls video because 6 minutes 15 second is impressive too. She's a cheater. She don't even have much fries with her challenge and her shakes didn't even look filled to the top. She can't claim that 6:15 mark.
If he didn't talk during eating maybe he could be     10 seconds faster
they didn't fill your fries all of the way up
Did anyone else notice Matt has two different eye colors??
Bruh stonie ate 25 Big Macs I would think this new challenge Would be easy for\nHim
do you eat pussy like that?
i cant believe that im watching someone eating xD
Mattie, if it comes to eating challenges, you *really* shot *NOT* cut the video, not even for a split of a second. Because, you know, cutting the videos like this one makes you look like a *cheater* .
oh go on Matt there's loads
When you realize someone can  eat about 5,000 calories faster than you can eat ten
I actually found this pretty disturbing.

Skippy P.B. Bites Challenge! Double P.B.
Hail Hydra!
Don't try it now. Because it sounds like you going through a lot of changes in your life and we women we tend to change our hair, either color it or cut it when we going through life changes, challenges, breakup etc... so don't change it now but if you still feel the same way after a while then go for it. God bless (trust the process).
What was that kitty litter thing Bear was looking into?
This was great! Navy hair?? GO FOR IT! I think it'll look good on you. It's almost fall so why not?! If blondes can pull off pink you can def pull of navy! We live for these vlogs!!! Hope all is well w you and your fam! ♥️
Sending you lots of love and hugs yours way, also blue hair would look stunning on you!
Never go wrong with Velcro chokers!!! Cant understand why companies use chains... I guess so you'll keep buying them when they break🤔
Do NOT dye your glorious,BEAUTIFUL  hair.
If they broke up , its prob there busy schedules or the fact that Brett STILL hadnt proposed. No matter how much a woman says shes in no rush bla bla bla, no one wants to be the forever girlfriend.
Does anyone know what style those celine sunnies are?
What are your favorite shopping sites for clothing and shoes? I really love your style and I've been wanting to do some online shopping. Please help!
Yes to the blue hair!! I got dark navy blue on my ends and got so many compliments on it :)
Carli, honestly: you are GREAT and I follow you since a long time now, BUT I'm deep in love with your sister-friend (since I first saw her in one of your video when you transformed her! Can't you help me to come to know her? ;)
Unboxing must feel like Christmas morning every time
I love her love for animals. Shes so sweet and kind. 💜
Can you make this makeup look? Thank you
I love you and I love watching your videos. I've been a loyal subscriber for years now. And one thing that I wish you did is involve us in some of your personal life you always say maybe one day I'll talk about it. But we're your family you should feel comfortable sharing things from your past and present. Bc all we see is a perfect women with a perfect life and a perfect relationship with a perfect home and a perfect job. You know? I want to be able to see the real you through the camera. Think about it? I love and support you always. 💛
Absolutely gorgeous 🔥

Navy blue for sure!
I am dreading watching the next video something is up whatever it is Carli know that I love you and life moves forward no matter what.
Hi Carli, I think you would look gorgeous with dark blue hair. Dark purple would also look great.
Carli i just hoping everything is okay with you lets hope guys it has nothing to do with her relationship because carli doesnt go anywhere without bret and if you look in the past videos he hasnt been anywhere to be found carli just know we are here for you sis
I love your hair in the beginning of the vlog!
Omg how the deer kissed your hand was the most heartwarming thing ever😍 animals can sense good people you must be one of them!
You're so beautiful 😭
Will you do a fall shoe try on hall or a favorite shoe try on haul? I love your style and I love that you don't buy everything designer, but I need to see an item on to know if I NEED it!
Get a wig first in the hair color you want and then make your decision from there
DO THE NAVY BLUE HAIR!!
Carli: Deer Whisperer. Love you and hope you are doing well <3
Do a wonder woman costume video it suits you perfectly
Why you heat your hair so frequently and it still so shiny and healthy? what did you do to your hair ?
Wedding makeup will be nice,  what u guys think about it?
No matter what,  I know I will support you and your future endeavors because I relate to you and never feel alone! We are all here to help and support you! Lots of love and more happy days to come!
your hair is so shiny, i kno you have lights on but thats not all that shine. What product do you use in your hair,,,and i think navy blue would look amazing!!!
Try it navy blue
What you are doing for your dad right now is amazing 🙏🏼 when he is recording you 🙌🏼 it was super cute!! I hope your relationship gets stronger! And I hope all is well with your bf. 😘💖🌷 xoxo
ILYSM since I was like in 7th grade... I'm a junior now
we need a look book with those new shoes carliiiiiI! + I say dye your hair blue or you'll never know! :) \nSLAY GIRL! \n\nxoxo
What lashes are u wearing here?? Need to know 😍😍
You looked like the girl from The Ring when feeding the deer because of your hair! LOL but your limo ride was so funny that would be me and my friend!! Same music and all!!
try the navy blue hair!!! You only live once, might as well have some fun :) also you could pull it off
Yesss blue hair would look awesome on you! Especially with you're eyes 👀
Navy blue hair would be super cute
Hope everything with you and Brett is good!
hope everything is okay with you and brett... 💖
Can you please do a hair video? About what products you use and how you keep it healthy. I watched your video from a couple years ago, but I'm curious if your routine has changed! ❣️
Damn she is dope as fuck, kind of reminds me of Kim Kardashian.
Tutorial on that look please
Blue or dark purple would be badass!!!
Your hair looks so healthy & shinny, what do you use & do you hair a hair care routine? Would love to know, thanks!
yes dye your hair blue you only live once....big fan 😄😄😄
I THINK SHE IS CARDI B
I hope your ok, so sweet of you to video when you clearly aren't feeling it. We appreciate you! \nYou really seem sad! I hope you and Brett are ok. You two are perfect for one and another. Girls only change their hair so dramatically when big life changes happen so I'm scared what you'll tell us xx
Yes to blue hair!
Dear Carli : \nIf you ever see this comment, I for one would love to see a tutorial  for the gorgeous eye look you wore NYFW Marchesa Show <3 You are always so beautiful and down to earth! :) Hopefully you do one ^_^ been a subscriber for many years and I really enjoy your videos <3
i love the fact you still buying affordable options. How is your eczema? i hope you're doing great. xo
CarliBel, there 's a lot of speculation on here so i wanted to be positive and  tell you that you have been my most favorite youtuber along with nicole g since 2010 and thanks to you i've finally had the guts to start uploading and being more outgoing with myself. Love you! and never change for anyone! \n\n\nps: do the damn blue hair but only for yourself, no one else.
Where is the collection carliiii
when we she said and we met some cutiessss I was like WAIT WHAT WHERES BRETT ? if y'all did split up , I'm actually really sorry 🙁 your a beautiful person inside and out your always find love❤️
It´s strangely quiet in your house now :S where´s Brett? I hope you´re ok, hun <3 you seem different :S love you <3<3<3
As weird as this sounds, I honestly can't help but tear up watching this video. I've been watching your videos for like 5 years now and I cant help but feel a little empathetic towards your energy. Take your time to cater to yourself and work things out for the better of you and the people around you. You have an amazing head on your shoulders, Carli.
Where is Brett? I have a strong feeling for some reason that you guys aren't together 😞I hope not! 😐 I feel like your trying to be strong for us while making this video, but if so then you are doing a good job 💕
Hey mama you definitely look like you're going through some stuff. Whatever it is just know it will get better with time. Sometimes we need to stop and take time for ourselves to reflect and heal. Hope to see your bubbly self back again soon😊.
You can definately feel the vibe of this videoo! :( Carli's always cheery and bubbly!!
You should definitely dye your hair navy blue I just done it recently I honestly loved it but it didn't last long in my hair that's the only downfall
Your hair is goals. It's so shiny and long.
Dark chocolate mauve isn't a bad option either
Go for it!I have ashy-blue balayage now. My natural hair colour and skintone is simular to yours, so I guess it will look good on you.
YES! Do it <3 Long and blue would suit you so much x
Can I see some looks that I haven't seen on Keeping up with Kardashians .pleasse
You have beautiful hair 😄
Carli! You look so pretty with light hair, like blonde. But Im sure you can pull of any color❤️❤️☺️
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR PERFUME?????
What do you do with your hair? So beautiful. I know that keratin treatments are usually not vegan so I am curious 🎀🎀
Yes! Navy blue hair and Wonder Woman tutorial!!
I think you would look beautiful with blue hair! I'd say go for it! I'd love to see a video of you dying it :D <3

migdnight/navy blue
Thumbs up if you wanna see Justin Roiland on this show!!
PLEASE get the broad city girls on here!
Get Adam 22 on here
Those wings need to be cooked more!
Brian Regan would also be very funny on the show
Well, this guest was boring.
With the Emmys just passed, made me think, what makes something eligible for an Emmy? Can Hot Ones win an Emmy?
Dillon Francis, redist ears in the game
You guys should get Marshawn Lynch on here
Boys noize would be fun to see
Had to come by again and say how good that hot sauce is.. Damn it man
Get logic on the show
One of my favorite episodes!
yo get Stephen King on here
Way better than any vlog. You go, adult, bald man!
You guys need to get marshawn lynch on this show it would a great episode
At 9:52 what's the name of the artist that Dillion mentions?
Reference at 9:50 \nI went to look at had 6.3 million views. (this one has boobies fair warning! *gasp*)\nGESAFFELSTEIN - PURSUIT (Official Video)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnBt6DLKZpI\n\nand 1.7 million on the other. \nGESAFFELSTEIN - PURSUIT (Official video - BLURRED version)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB8Ci7X5HUU\n\nand the links for people looking.
Please have Ski Mask the Slump God or Khalid! :)
Fuck I love Dillon!
Get bigquint on here pls
14:20
his pits were sweaty
Sean looks like he is getting bored with this shit.
Get diplo on the show!
Tyler the creator please!!!!!
Sean, my man, you gotta get Marshawn Lynch on here.
it taste like a piece of shit, LOL
7:59 why is rick in the back ground
You guys should add The Black Label Shit the Bed hot sauce to the roster
DO ONE WITH LEBRON JAMES
This is the best show on YouTube; fuck Vlogs \nCouldn't agree more Dillon
When Sean says Where the questions are hot and the wings are even hotter it doesn't sound like his heart is in it anymore.
Get Jack black on!
where did dillon francis get his shirt
get Conor McGregor on this show
You should do interview with Jaromir Jagr and Steve Aoki. I would kill for these two to have them on Hot Ones.
Never shopping at the gap, that was painful having to listen to Cher
The thing I love about this show is learning about all these cool people that I probably wouldn't otherwise have ever paid attention to.
Get Tyler, The Creator on this
All my dreams just came true
Y'all should get Rhett and Link on the show.
Sean. My man. Stop giving me a heart attack with that laptop placement.
Don't know who this guy is. I'm giving it thumbs up for Sean, but I'm moving on
Was that blue milk?
I think the debunk of a milk strategy can't be truly tested while using almond milk. You gotta go straight vitamin D, that WHOLE MILK, to get that real coating going. Real milk and hot foods are great together!
Just start making these longer, it feels like theres so much edited out, id watch hour long episodes XD
You need to invite Phillip Defranco on the show!!! He is an awesome and influential creator on Youtube and he is a huge fan of the show!!
Dillon Francis? Never heard of him....
Love this show, but I dislike when they cut off the answer just as it's getting good. Up your editing game!
really want to see Rhett and Link make an appearance.
14:21  Projectile traveling at 420 miles an hour
What's the music at 3:47?
Make the early sauces a little bit hotter
Sean i did see El Yucateco show cased any more... too hot? No, let me guess, NOT hot enough. Try El Yucateco Black Label it just might make his way up the list...
dillion seems pretty cool i wouldn't mind chillin with the guy seems very cool
Whoa. Why is Dillon so chill? I didn't know he has a chill mode :0
sorry can't watch your videos' after having wacked dj's on here
Why don't you guys do a celebrity call out? Allow the guests on the show to call out a friend they want to do the challenge.That should happen at the end of every episode.
The color on this vid is terrible.
Isn't it like the first time Sean has cursed? 😮
Wonderful clear vidos 👏💕💕💕💕👏  welcome to our new video is always happy to make new friends
Get Jesus on here!!!!
You know him from NO! I don't know him from shit Sean.
You Gotta Interview Hillary Clinton! That's be dope because she is a hot sauce enthusiast.
Some or all members of Avenged Sevenfold
Sean, hit me with a Jack Antonoff segment.
Get John Cena on here
Great episode Sean.  Dillon is hilarious.
Why did you stop telling us that you love us? Do you not love us anymore, Sean? 😩😩😩😩
why can't they poop on tour buses wtf?? Pooping is a natural thing. They should PAY you for holding it in  cause thats some fucked up shitttttttttttttttttt

Michael Vick
You HAVE to get Tommy Wiseau on this show! That'd be the BEST one. lol
I don't know if they choose to leave in the part where people say oo that's good on the Hot One's Fiery Chipotle, but dammit I want that sauce. Sell it on Amazon too!!! Sheesh. Did you all sign a contract that says THIS WEBSITE ONLY AND NO OTHER VENDORS?\n\nEdit: If the Hot Ones crew reads these comments: it seems nobody (even others who purchase the sauce) seems to like Da Bomb hot sauce. All heat and no flavor is the overwhelming review.
sick,sick,sick
18:53 xD
can y'all please do Yara Shahidi
favorite interview ever
Need to get Joe Rogan!
Poetic Segway
I wanna see FaZe Jev on here

Not the Next Sia or Taylor Swift, but the First Grace VanderWaal. ☺
Your voice is so sweet
U are amazing grace, so inspiring and such a good artist. I live in New Zealand and even here I hear about you.
You have gone so far baby \nWho else thinks she looks like Taylor swift but her attitude is certainly not like snobby Taylor snakes she is an angle and amazing
Second I saw u on stage I said u will become something
Grace , i want to just tell you that i honestly love you from the bottom of my heart ❤️. I can't imagine what the world would be like without you and your incredible voice & ukulele skills . My dream is to meet you and i really hope it does happen soon ! I can't believe you have made it this far in your singing career , when i am older i want to become a singer like you & write my own songs like you too!! I have been a fan ever since day one of your audition at agt and i have to say that i am just so amazed by how incredible your voice was and also just how far you've made it .

This is gonna be the first CD I'll ever buy - I just want to support you. <3 Go, Grace!
Seeing this, I know that Grace is going to do wonderful things. So might even become the next Taylor Swift ❤\n#Fanderwaal
And dont forget, its better if you take a break of music(if it takes to much place you life) than waiting for it to be to much to handle, tip: dont make you suffer from music, music is here to make u feel good
Grace! You are amazing! The presonality you have is so precious. Thanks for being you in every step. Jesus is so pleased with everything that you do. You have inspired me to learn play  ukulele))))\nGo on! The best is yet to come! With love from Ukraine.

#FanderwaalSinceDayOne ;3 \nWe love you grace ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You are brilliant i love your songs ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🎼🎶🎵🎵🎶🎶🎵🎵🎶🎶🎶🎶🎵🎵🎵🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎵🎵
How old is this gurl?○-○
who loves grace?\nGive me your like to show to me your proof that you are like grace 😉
what is your fandom 's name Grace ??
Grace, i'm a fan of yours. I enjoyed mostly every single song that you wrote. But there's something bothering me. I find it many of your studio version songs (Sick of Being Told, So Much More Than This, Gossip Girl) used too much effects. I don't find it bad or anything, but personally i think its better if it stays simple. Just you, and your ukelele. No effects.\n\n I enjoyed those songs, but when i see you perform the simple acoustic way (Ed Sheeran's A Team, your whole AGT performances, your iHeart Radio performances), its so BEAUTIFUL. There's something more to it, it drawn people to you. Those performances so magical, so beautiful and i don't understand what that is. And i think its better for your studio versions song stay that way. I'm not a music expert or something, just my opinion. \n\nNo matter what i always love you and will always support you! Thanks!\n\n(sorry for my english)
Could be a coincidence but she's releasing her album the same day as Taylor Swift. ANYWAY I AM SO EXCITED! AHJGGH I love Grace.
Love grece
Yeah, Norm tells too many shaggy dog stories to be truly funny. By the time he's done, I've lost interest and don't remember the setup enough to find the punchline funny. He does this because he's lazy. It's far easier to tell a half dozen or so shaggy dog stories and call it a comedy special than than to think up funny material worth our time. \n\nMost of his jokes are puerile in nature and are no better than a poor _Knock-knock joke._ He just takes it too far and stretches it into another of his shaggy dog stories that were much better left alone as Knock-knock jokes.
Norm Macdonald is totally polarizing. Love him. I was jerking punks off under the Queensboro Bridge until I found his work.
Do you work for vox?
I was following you until I saw sarah silverman on the comedy greats screen
The last few months I have become obsessed with Norm. and voila! a video which explains why he is so unique and why I am so drawn to his humor like a moth to a flame
he's nothing on stewart lee tho, brits do this sort of comedy far better
Thanks for shining a light on him for all us moths!
How about a video on Rick and Morty?
Man, your voice-overs are getting better! You sound more serious, and less like you want to be smooth or seductive.
Am I the only one who remembered that JD used to tell this moth joke to a girl once in scrubs?
This video has changed my week so far.\nNorm really is a hidden gem, much like Stanhope.
That last joke stolen from Billy Connelly if I'm not mistaken.
backgrounds of red screens with yellow accents, McDonald analogy?
Please do Rick and Morty!
Please do one on Stewart Lee... PLEASE EVAN!
I….don't see it.
You should do a video about Mitch Hedberg because he was a genius.
Never seen this channel before, but as a Norm fan and a nerd writer myself, I appreciate the coverage. New subscriber.
Please upvote this for Science [Serious]\nI am looking to fill up our quota for early testers for a Master your Humor Game project at Purdue Uni, that we are doing to further application of humor research. (can validate by .edu email if you are doubtful of trolling).\nThere is a lot being done there and it's not benefitting humans as it does to AI. Well to keep it simple, we all have worked hard on trying to make a game module that we think helps people tap into their inner funny in a fun way.\nIf you have a couple of minutes for 2-5 days we would love to have you test it out and give us a little feedback. Sign up at http://comuslabs.com/ -- Program starts 23rd Sept.\nGoogle Dr.Raskin if you still have doubts.
Strongly agree, on all points. \n\nI believe I recall watching one of his candid discussions (I believe with Letterman maybe?) where Norm's comedic personality was discussed and I recall it being mentioned that...to paraphrase...too many comics try to be intellectual but Norm understands...play the simpleton. Be the everyman. Because if the audience sees you trying to be the smartest person in the room, they're going to hate you.\n\nBut I believe, to anyone who investigates further and listens more closely, his brilliance becomes evident.
Never watch SNL but after watching this I definitely need to look him up!
I DISAGREE completely, Norm Macdonald is NOT a funny man.
I can definitely appreciate him and his craft more now, but yea, I don't think he's funny :(
I thought the video had something to do with McDonald's. And now I'm all hungry.
greatest of all time.
Huh, newfound respect for the way my Grandpa told jokes <3
comedian tells long drawn out jokes, not pandering to different styles of comedy. WOW - way to stretch out 1 sentence into 8 minutes
Duh. What's next, a video on why Bob Dylan is an amazing songwriter? ...Oh wait...
This video was so brilliantly edited!
when uncle terry's been drinking... you don't fuck wit him
This video essay was excellently written and put together. Love Norm, love the video!
in Norm Macdonald Live Sarah Silverman episode , she spotted Norm's wordplay and exposed it in a light way , part.1 minute 6:00 \n\nSarah really gets norm's comedy a lot more than everybody else
Love the red and yellow haha\n\nBut Im shocked to read a lot of comments that never heard of Norm
Nerdwriter - do you take requests? One of my favorite films is No Country for Old Men. ( I saw that ending coming, I swear I did!) I have my opinions about what it means, but I would love to hear your analysis.
I love this kind of long story telling humor.\n\nThere a guy that does his jokes like this.\nHe talk about the little things of his daily life. Then he start rambling and we end up forgeting what was the first point he was talking about, but that doesn't matter as his story telling mastery is to a point where although he end up making 4 hour long shows, every minute of it is an hysterical burst of laugh. \n\nThis kind of comedy is the best to me.\nIt require true skill to be able to pull this.
I just find out a great comic character i've never heard of ! :) Thanx Nerdie !
Norm would watch this video and completely disagree and say 'I'm just telling jokes man', he's awesome
Why do avoid a case study of the Mona Lisa ?
not my cup of tea. Like I get the jokes but the pay off is not worth the time I spent listening to it.
You should do a video on Stewart Lee
Stewart Lee?
Please do a video about Stewart Lee.
more canadian comics, they have ruled for years! jim carey?
This is a dude who nearly won $1,000,000 on Millionaire.
Where can I find that joke about the body
I'm so glad you uploaded this. Norm is one of my favorite comedians. I think his work, though underrated, is genius.
Love norm, like your vids, felt this was a weak one as i didnt really learn how/why norm is a genius past He's brilliant because he's smart. Just felt like a lot was left on the table. Maybe ill like it more when I come across it again in a year or two :)
Similar commitment to their own personal comedy: John Roderick and Merlin Mann
This guy sounds just like Lagos Cargo
Maybe I'm one of the people who doesn't find him funny. Where's the joke
Could you do a video on howard stern?
I instantly recognized that the outtro music was a remix of mozarts requiem (lacrimosa) ^^
Wow. He just seems like an asshole
Wow. I went through that video for 7 minutes listening with mild amusement and thinking He really does sound like a comic genius, but one that isn't quite my taste. Then that last punchline hit me. It's taken me 10 minutes to stop laughing long enough to write this comment.
I like listen to you advertize to me sooooo much more than that Karly Kloss chick who uses WIX....and its easy to use and blah blah blah. Nerdwriter!
I _knew_ about Norm Macdonald but honestly had never seen his comedy. Thank you, again, Nerdwriter, for bringing something new (a perspective, an interest) into my life. I really like Norm's sense of humor, so now I've got to check out more. Where should I start - some comedy special, perhaps? I think I heard he has a podcast and I listen to podcasts daily so that might be an easy introduction.
Ah, the moth joke...one of my favorites.
RIP Norm. One of the greats.
I discovered that we don't have a similar sense of humour...
Norm is just ok. This video proved that.
I would love to hear your thoughts on Stewart Lee
Well... as a non american I didn't get any of his humour  :/
I know I dont like his style, because I didnt laugh at one thing in this video.
Thank you for this nerdwriter. Excellent analysis. Norm is one of the greats.
Not even being funny here but Norm MacDonald saved my life.  Read my heart-felt open thank you letter to him on twitter @bonkers_doozy
I'm so glad I found this video. I didn't know norm. Now I love him
Norm MacDonald is like cringe comedy without comedy. Just cringe
I guess I have a different sense of humor cause I didn't even giggle at this guys jokes. To each their own
Learned nothing apart from the fact that Norm MacDonald exists
My coworkers brother worked for snl and said that norm had a habit of pissing in empty beer bottles around his apartment. It was common knowledge that if you were at norms apartment you should never put your beer down.
Norm is a genius.  Well made.
Not once did I laugh. Not sure if it's me or the comedian.
Norm is one of those comics whose jokes you remember, but not the kind of comic whose jokes smart people try to repeat to other people, rather you take them and show them Norm telling that joke.
You should do a video on Stewart Lee, he's probably the king of intellectual comedians.
Why am I watching a video on Norm Macdonald when I can watch brokeback mountain and watch a cock slip into some guys hot beautiful asshole
This video should be titled, In Defense of Dad Jokes
Look at this delusional poster trying to sell Alex Jones as a comic genius. No, Hicks is a very talented voice actor, but he had to mimic standups like George Carlin and Sam Kinnison. Now he mimics Rush Limbaugh. He was a nobody before his CIA handler Frank Gannon took him to England to bash America (like Rich Hall later did). All this Hicks was a legend stuff started after his conversion to Alex Jones was exposed.
My gosh, He sounds like Colonel Sanders. The best actor to portray him, without a doubt. He personified him so well.
Great vid - great timing. I just watched his new special. He really comes out swinging. Loved the kind of cold open he did. Original. \n\nListen, have you seen Legion yet?  It will inspire you to write. The point of view study, the production design, the lighting! It is so up your alley -or so it seems to me. I really don't know you all that well.\n\nHere's to inspiration! Huzzah.
It's great to see this appreciation of Norm's comedy.  In my opinion, Norm is the greatest living comedian.  Thanks so much for this.
You must make a video talking about Memento!!
I'm going to force my sister and brother-in-law to sit down and watch this with me. I have a hard time convincing certain people that Norm MacDonald is the funniest person who has ever existed.
Hey man! Something about The Sopranos or Gandolfini would be much appreciated.
Funniest man on earth. My hero!!!
Thank you! Norm's comedy is so smart it gives me chills. Great video.
I wonder where he got the idea to intersperse the moth joke throughout the whole video
I LOVE Norm.
Great vid Nerdwriter!
Thank you
#NormGod
Dude relax it's just norm Mcdonald
9/11
Phil Hartman, I dare you.
OMG i love this.
Please do Patrice O'Neal
So fucking boring.
Jim Jeffries
Yea, he seems okay, I think I still prefer Amy Schumer
Monty Python next?
Ugh. Norm MacDonald sucks.
$60 for 2 like eyeshadows is ridiculous. Like it could have gold on it and I would still pass
🙄🤑🤑🤑 i'll pass
That white shirt suits u tati
I wish the review of Fenty Beauty would have been like this.  😬\n(Sorry about my english)
Obsessed with your eye make up!!!
How about a full face using only Clinique makeup and face lotions/toners/primers??!! Please!!!
You can slay any makeup thrown at you!! I'd never spend that much on two eye-shadows when I can get an entire pallet of high quality shadows that are full pallets for that. If I'm going to, well if I could, splurge, I'd just get the new Natasha Denona pallet that I want so badly.
When does this come out in U.S. stores??
4 eyeshadows for 95$ man that better change my eye color, see thru the dark, see when someone is a fakeas$ and see the future
*THAT GLOSS LOOKS JUST LIKE GLOSS BOMB FROM FENTY!AND THE FENTY ONE SMELLS LIKE VANILLA AND PEACHES RIHANNA SAYS!!!*
:: i especially love your eye look today 💪🏼💫::
thumbs up girl!
Love your eye makeup! Slayyyyy
Eye makeup looks amazing today!! Also, her skin legit looks airbrushed today??
I can't tell you how much I appreciate you channel, your honesty, your high-to-low thinking in products <3 so happy to have your advise in my life (and youtube feed)! Go Tati!
Your eye makeup is GORGEOUS!!!
Clickbait! Lol Tati
Tati for President!!
There are two shades of the bronzer when I look online. Which shade are you talking about here Tati? We have similar coloring so I want to get what you have :)
🤔🤔🤔
You look stunning 💕💕💕💕💕
The foil eye shadow looks chunky, patchy an drying on you Tati.
Tati!!! Please WTF Beauty Pie makeup and skincare! I totally value your opinions and would love to see if you think it's a good deal.
Your eye look is so pretty. I am going to get that eye foil. I hope VB meets YOU someday.😀
SMASHING VIDEO!!!!!
The packaging yes it's beautiful. But the price is.... bleh. Tati your eyes is so intense today, I love your blush or anything you put on your cheek. So beautiful.
Four eyeshadows palette is 75 not 95 on Sephora FYI
Regulate telescope account awgqw expect scary establishment faint.
And everyone complains about Natasha Denona palette prices. Holy hell!
Reindeer nose contour
Tati, where did you get those earings? 😍😍
Ur skin looks photoshopped!!!
I loved this!
your makup looks great
your makeup look is absolutely gorgeous <3 <3 <3
it's funny how in the comments people be like 'it's too expensive!!!' but where i live makeup is quite expensive (that's why i don't wear makeup lol) these items will be much expensive in my country.
I feel like rare smells like vanilla flowers all the time
$60 for an eyeshadow duo. What the deuce??!
I am getting one of the eyshadow duos but im confused is the formula at least good?
the annabelle silver cream shadow looks exactly like that stuff
You look as luxurious as that packaging 😚
Wonderful review. Starting g following you today. Thanks!
$95 dollars for FOUR SHADOWS! I'D RATHER BUY A NATASHA DENONA PALETTE THEN
The freaking prices are absolutely ridiculous
Wow $95 for 4 friggin eyeshadows!!??? If I'm gonna spend that I rather spend a little more & get a Natasha D pallete!
Your eye look does look beautiful! But I would never purchase those 2 colors together for that price.
I want that freaking foil but not for 40😑
I hope you at least get some free cosmetic bag or something...I love you TATI.
Not hot at all 😪😡
Tati you have to tell us where you get your hand mirrors from....!!!!
Hi :) , could you do a video on the uk skincare brand Simple, I would love to know what you like and don't.\n\nLike this if you want this video and so she can see. \n\nLove your videos Tati, you're the best at reviewing 💜✨
I'm probably wrong but watching this video it looks like you're having a bad day and can't wait to be done with filming 😔 I so hope I'm wrong. Lots of ❤❤
Meh, wouldn't buy anything associated with that miserable mare (VB not Tati!!) and don't get me started on the, frankly, obscene pricing 😡😡
Hi Tati,  Can you please do a Hot or Not for Lashed cosmetics and Flirt cosmetics???
Thanks Tati. I like you more when you are like this, honest but not over dramatic.
Does that bronzer only come in 1 shade..... lol
Hi Tati, PLEASE could you do a Hot Or Not video about inglot products🙏🏻 I've just started to use some of the pigment shadows and OMG! I now you would love them (especial the purples!!🤣) \n,!!!PLEASE EVERYBODY LIKE THIS, FOR TATI TO MAYBE READ THIS !!!!
i just subscribed to your channel, your thumbnails dont do any justice to how beautiful you are! i always saw you on my recommendations, and never realized how sophisticated and gorgeous you are, until i pressed the play buttom😅😍! 🇭🇳
Wouldn't spend a dime on this line. I guess every Tom, Dick and Harry puts out a makeup line.
Will this be at sephora? or only department stores?
Another overpriced makeup launch. Makeup is marked up 500 times
those prices are a complete and utter joke. you can get dupes that are just as good and are way more worth it
Love your earrings! Can you tell us where you got them?
I just love how honest u are ur great
Packaging is so gorgeous...but too expensive for my budget.
Hi Tati! Love this eye look! Any dupes you could think of for the Eye Foil?? Or similar glitters? xx Thank you <3
but taro YOU'RE MY FASHION icon
Hi Tati - could you review loose powder foundations from the drug store? I want to try bare minerals but its hard on the budget :)
Just watching this to calm me down while sitting in the hospital 💕
You look so much like Victoria Beckham in my opinion! I can definitely see a likeness there! If you see this comment, I'm from Wales in the U.K. and adore your channel!! You're one of the reasons why I have such an interest in make up. Thanks for all your hard work uploading videos, you're really one of the best youtubers! Lots of love, an avid subscriber x
I was going to buy some of those products for my mum for Christmas :)
Ha, Pixiewoo did pretty much the same with those eyeshadows and the foil! I can't see a different way of using that odd combo either.
any of you want to support each other and sub to each others channels? I sub back! plz let me know :))
I love this review Tati. I just got the powder, quad, foil, bronzer, highlighter and the black and cream duo. The quality is amazing! Can you do a tutorial with this eye? It is stunning!
I find it weird how you say its up there in price but dont you use the Sisley primer and other products that are way more than this??
Tati. I would love to see you do more off brands like juvias place and other brands like that. Or like the glitters/shimmer from smolder cosmetics!!! Pleaseeee
I hate this eye makeup. The glitter looks so childish and messy
I feel like Tati has gone down the expensive make up route which in honesty I'm happy for her because you know she's making that $$$ but at the same time sad because she would be my go to person for drugstore make-up. Now I can't really relate to the videos or watch the much because it's just high end after high end or make up you buy online. :/
ok i was plucking my eyebrows while watching this and when you said that the burgundy quad was $95 i almost poked my eye out
the eye shadow quad is 75.  Which bronzer were you holding, java sun or saffron sun?
I like see you using the products, not just talking about them!❤
Love the eye look!!
Tati could you do a tutorial on your look today. Your eyes look gorgeous!!!!!!
Real talk though: how does that primer compare to the loreal lumi one?
tati can you review Paul & Joe cosmetics ??
Seems awfully expensive. You could get a pretty good, large palette for the same money elsewhere......
I thought that Victoria was with Tati from the thumbnail...
Tati I did a video on a jelly face mask but I though it would be a good wtf item for you to try out!
You might as well get the Natasha Denona pallet
I think that they should sell an initial launch/line with the expensive packaging and then the products without all of the expensive packing. Definitely feel like some of the more expensive products you're paying for the packaging (which is great by the way) and I would get it if it weren't for the price.
Appreciate your honesty that's what keeps me watching xxx
That nose contour does not look good.
I was going to completely pass on this collection, but after watching this video I just placed an order for the eye foil.  Looks stunning Tati!!
I spend a lot of money on makeup, but never in my life would i ever spend $95 on an eyeshadow quad lol this collection is way too expensive
This eye make up, makes your eyes look really small.. not a good one.
Omg Estée Lauder has lost there minds I brought a ND LILA palette for the first time and wow I thought that 129 was a bit much for 15 shadows and They have 2 tiny for 60 and 4 tiny for 95 and a primer for 95 totally ridiculous all makeup companies better be taking notes fro RIHANNA & that is what's up she just set a whole new expectation for makeup
For 95 dollars you could save  more money and buy Natasha Denona, better quality, mucho more product...
I love Tati but sometimes she focuses too much on the packaging when, in reality the packaging (beyond a pump for foundations and primers) has almost nothing to do with why someone should buy a product, ever!
You look absolutely stunning tati
I love your eye makeup transformations just love ❤️ itt☝️😱
My balls itch just looking at these things
Congrats on the big 8mil! Well earned :)
Coyote NEEDS to do an episode with sharks in it! like if you agree

YOWZERRZZ!!!!!
One of the most incredible channels I've ever seen! Congrats on 8 million!

I look up to you coyote. I learn everything about nature from you. You make learning about nature fun.😇😇😇

Woah, 8 million subscribers! Congratulations! I remember liking you when you had 300 K subscribers :')
Burrowing sea urchins don't bite they can only chew Thrue Rock and hard surfaces and there bites feels like it tickles
U should swim with mermaid mallisa i think thats her name\n\nLike if u agree 👍
Coyote is so cute I love him😍💜
1:28 I got bored and went to watch Adventure Time! XD
One time I went to rehobeth beach and there was one half way in the sand I didn't know and I stepped on it

Starmie @14:41. Thanks me later.
When u say island what comes to my mind is Australia
Steve Irwin: Wow mate, we got a little Alpheidae here!\nCoyote: Whoa, I got some kind of shrimp creature. I'm going to gauge its pinch (attaches shrimp to nipple)
*i wish coyote was my teacher 😂 much better than Mr. Raymond 😔*
Who dislikes these videos? wtf
It looks so much like Reunion Island !!
Did anyone jump when he held it and it stung him?
Why dont you guys have a show in TV???
10:30 😍😍😍😍
cody come to lousana to get bet by a co\nper head
Can you do a getting bit by horse video? Please.
This is FAR more scary than Joy Of Creation xD
I think he shouldnt use a title like that, it rests content on the video. In my opinion exploring the tide pools of hawai would be more fitting
And so it just so happens I like to boogie I like to hip hop all day I need a goblet yea that's how you should drink your favorite beer ho ho ho a banana goes great in a salad I work at the bank all day I'm lucky!
THE FUNNIEST PART WAS WHEN THE GRANDMA SAID, Momma godda smack dat!
Wow. That was really really good. I'd see the shit out of that movie.
Do one of The Sopranos!
Maybe a salad\nI don't train myself to starve\n😂😭😂😭😂😂😂😂😂😂
Awesome and the real show is a freaking masterpiece
Never thought love had much of a point. But I was wrong: it has a thousand points. #incredible
What's that song at the end?
This parody trailer was more cohesive than many other real trailers.
This should be the actual show
This was awesome. Just binged all 3 seasons. Loved it!! And this!
Bravo! I'd watch this version.
I would pay soo much money to see this movie
Great job. Love this show. 👍😎💸
Hi Bad Lip Reading can you do Jacob Satorious--sweatshirt please and thank you
this story is more interesting then the real narcos
I'm really disappointed that this isn't how Narcos really went lmao
This is LITERALLY the exact opposite of the show 😂
This was a bit of a tear jerker.
Poeeeease do another Game of Thrones one
This needs to be a real show, same with Medieval funtime land
Who are you? Your beautiful firstborn son!LOL!!!
Pepe saw me pooping while I was eating s'mores and also crying.
This is so great, that I think I've watched it at least 3 times a day since it came out. Keep up the good work BLR!
Press the cork board up so the entire manatee is behind the preacher. I like blr's new style. Making it suspenseful, humorous, family related, then emotional. This should totally be a real movie taking out some funny parts. I think this was a great blr and blr should make more like this. Your head IS a butt.
Wow bravo!!
Please do Stranger Things
This is legendary
This is better than the actual movie! 😂
Can this please be real. Like I said please.
What's the song at 6:10?
Pablo is like the H3H3 of crime 😂
I'm looking for the song lol
I've watched the show but this vid was believable!
The gun is real 😂
I wish this was a real show!
This pisses me off cuz I want this to be a show now,  and I'll never see it
Narcos was good but I wanna watch this show
Best video of the year........Have my subscription u fellaz
I love this BLR film. 😂😂😂😂😂
When is it coming out?
How much weed does it take to make one of these?
Can you do The Princess Bride next? Maybe?
Never trust an edited comment.
Wut is the actual story to narcos?
This is better than season 3!
No art is complete without a song.\nI want a boogie!
The editing was so good for the trailer style effect.
This is a damn masterpiece.
Genius! BLR really created something Epic here. Taking a TV show like Escabor and creating a false spin off in a Movie Trailer. That is funny, makes since and will make you real for the main character. This was Amazing!
Is nobody gonna talk about 1:32
I would legitimately watch this if it was an actual show.
I feel like this show would have one of those moments where 2 people who look alike are about to get shot they say they're the real one
Mommy needs to hit that😮😂😂😂😂😂
I would actually watch this and be happy about it
U guys should do a BLR if Nacho Libre.
I fuckin love how you turned this spoof into a movie trailer for one of those typical corny,disguise/action movies from the early 2000s.. the music gave it away lol
I'd for real watch this if this is the plot. But it's not so.. oh well.
Stupid Mexicans killed the director.
I love this. You somehow made this historical fiction on a violent cartel, a comedy. I would definitely watch an actual show like this.
Not that funny i miss the trump videos thoes were the best BRING TRUMP BACK
This is so incredible what the HECK
When you start watching a BLR video for funny one liner jokes and it ends up being a an emotional fleshed out story.
Maybe barbeque or maybe burrito   -> The best one xD
man i forgot this was a bad lip reading for a sec, and i really thought this was a thing... and i really wanted to see this.
Come on @Netflix , This is what we want. A comedy called: “soy Pablo” produced by the bad lip reading squad
I would watch that if you made that, that was awesome
Love it...
Superb! And better than the original show too, I should imagine.
Do Haim's Want you back video!
this is the funniest thing ive seen in 1 year
Damn... This was somehow a parody + a heartwarming trailer... *_*
Is this the real plot of the show?
was this really part of the real story? or drama started now.why not using same voice.
I want this movie - now! LOL!
Never really thought love have much of a point. But I was wrong, it has a thousand points. Wow, that's actually quite beautiful.
do the new Steven King's IT. please?
I'm not able to watch the original series now. This guy seems like a fat, goofy and clumsy but somehow sympathic guy and not like a drug cartel boss
Funnnnnnny
OH HEY MEXICAN FOOD
YES!!!
feel that pinch?
This deserves and Emmy
That really impressed me.
'Momma need to hit that lmfaooo🤣
fantastic
Oh man damn funny!!!!
maybe bbq or maybe burrito. 😂
Maybe bbq or maybe burrito\nLMAO
This got surprisingly emotional
Dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd\n\nBbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
LOL
RIP
Brilliant!
😂😂👏🏻👏🏻
This is sooooo gooddd....
Nice vid... Seya in a month
yombah
PLEASE DO CAMP ROCK PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
Why are they disrespecting narcos with this shit
YOUR BACKGROUND IS EVERYTHING!!😩🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Careful with the foundation when you wear the white denim jackets coz i got mine all covered in make up the first time i wore it!! :.(
Keep both pants sammi! Love your videos💕💕💕
Loving the background aesthetic in this video Sammi! Both the main shot and the cutaways xx
I was looking at your top wondering how it looked so much like the one I picked up at H&M and then you mentioned you got it from there! I was so excited that we had picked the same thing!
GIRLLL U LOOK SO GOOD HERE!! your skin is glowing and looking healthy!!
Fast fashion creates so much waste and affects the environment in such a negative way. I been a loyal viewer but I would like if you tried shopping In more eco friendly and conscious websites. \nFast fashion is destroying out world.
Liking the new outlook of the recent videos!! Go ahead!:-)
You look beautiful as always 😍
I love how you always try something new Sammi, you always give me some inspiration and not to stick to my comfort zone! Also, your hair looks incred! I absoluuuuutely love it! xxx
Can you tell me where you got your mirror from? I love the way you styled your office! Thank you :)
Yaaasss! Sammi! Amazing looks! You're the queen of fall winter fashion.
That red dress tho. And the styling was unexpected and amazing!
First pair of pants 😍😍😍 and you should keep the adidas pants and the denim skirt, both fit you very well.
Your style is incredible ♡
sees a haul, sets credit card next to computer haha
loved the video Sam :) Do you happen to know what kind of plant is on your desk? I love it so much!
I'd say return the adidas trousers xxx
Autumn/ Winter trends video......YES!  I would keep the Adidas pants! They look awesome!
absolutely keep the addidas pants that outfir you showed was a ten!
The black denim skirt looked gorgeous on you!!
Sam I love your style!🙌🏼
Sammy,  if you're not sure about the Addidas joggers then check out these trousers from Pull & Bear. It's got Addidas kinda vibe, but really smart and casual at the same time. It's only £19.99, I have been wearing it legit every day since I got them. Loved it so much that I bought it in diff colors. Here's the link https://www.pullandbear.com/gb/woman/clothing/trousers/tailored-jogging-trousers-with-side-stripe-c29021p500356645.html#800
Keep the Adidas ones and return the & Other Stories pair. I really wish you would've shown the chain on your bag. Maybe include that in another video or an Instagram post if possible. Always love your styling videos.
I agree on Realisation Par.  That site is like crack in dress form.
keep the adidas pants! and YES to an autumn trend video! also- love when you show us your shopping process- what you pick up, try on, say no to, etc!
Love to new filming space 😍
I really want that dungaree dress but I can't find it :(
I would love to see a autumn/winter how to video! you're so inspiring and I feel like I can relate with your style!
your style keeps getting better and better!! Loved the skirt dungarees!
Love these new pieces! Can't wait to see a 'how to wear' video :) \nYour videos always brighten my day - do keep them up! x
I desperately need the A/W trends video, haha ♥
Also agree with people complaining about the wrinkled shirt...yikes....
please do a autumn/winter how to wear vid, it would be so helpful!!!
I like the add addidas ones so much on you! I think take the other ones back! X
your style is absolutely stunning. You're totally top three of my favourite bloggers when It comes to style. I love you so much
Love your style sam !! \nMay I ask where the white chunky heels are from please ?!
Canne believe this shite trends  nowadays when back in the day a dog humping a fat burd was the video to be seen......how the bar has fallen
Some of my favorite videos from you Sammy ❤️
Lol why was this recommended?
You say 'Adidas' so differently lol. Here in Canada, we say A-Dee-Das
I cannot wait for your winter vlogs in London. Specially Christmas /festive season! Yass
Anyone know where she got her leggings?
I probably wouldn't keep the adidas trousers since you already got the other ones!!
What size did you get the adidas joggers in? I'm usually the same as you but everyones saying they come up small ahhh
I adore hearing you talk about clothing, it's so soothing in a way
Keep the Adidas! You have a great taste when it comes to fashion /styling <3 Kisses from Greece!
Love your Videos and also your Vlogs!!! ❤️❤️❤️ and Yes yes yes autumn/winter trends how to style \nGreetings from Germany 🙂
I've been looking for nice vinyl pants like yours but I couldn't finde any I liked... could you tell me you you got yours from?\n\nBtw love the contrast and the adidas look ;)
Why does Youtube promote your channel so heavily?
Keep Adidas pants! They both are cute💅🏾
Autumn/winter fashion is definitely my favorite too! The colors and layers loooove it so much :) Loove your fashion sense I always get a lot of inspiration from it xx
i've not seen dungarees lately at all
Can you do a haul of clothes cheaper but still a good style like yours like classy vintage?
Omg keep the adidas bottoms!! That outfit is 💣 xxx
keep the adidas! suits you way better!
also, this is one of my fav hauls you've done! and i've been watching since the  very beginning :)
where are your black leggins from :O they look awesome on you!
Thanks for the video Sam. I liked everything you picked. The only piece that I thought was a bit iffy. It's the red polka dot dress. I would be very incomplete wearing it with that very high wrap in front looks like you could have a wardrobe malfunction at any second. I would even be uncomfortable if I saw someone else wearing it bc you just know her pants will get flashed. I especially loved the jumpsuit and the stripped trousers. 🙂
Sometimes in your hauls you pull a clothing piece out and I'm thinking, idk about that item. But then you show a snippet of the item styled and I'm like, ok, yeah that looks awesome. And it always looks so good on you. You are really good at styling. And you make me want to buy pieces I would never buy. Haha. Anyways, what I'm trying to say is, I really love your styling videos and your hauls so keep 'em comin'.
That red polka dot dress is stunning😍😍😍😍
Love you gorgeous girl! ❤️ Your sense of style is spot on!
I can't even tell you how much I love you with curly hair!!!!! It looks so great on you, and that Realization Par dupe is so spot on 👀
YAAS, do that trends-video please!😍 can you do more lookbooks as well? I miss them🙂
I love the black denim skirt. Looks SUPERB on you. I also LOVE the blouse you are wearing. It's crazy to me how much H&M have stepped up their game as of late. Just a year ago there was NOTHING I wanted to buy from them. 
I really like the Adidas bottoms over the AOS stories ones, however you'll prob get more wear out of those ones as the joggers look beat with heels.. & who wears heels that often (not this mama anyway lol)
I love how you make trends completely 'yours'. Everything looks completely different on you, in the best way possible. I love and admire that! :)xX
I love your fashion videos so much aand how u always share your honest thoughts on pieces. Please make more autumn/winter videos. I moved from Greece to Sweden and i'm really not used to dressing for this weather, so some advice on how not to look like a potato bag would be much appreciated! Looking great as always Sammi xX
keep the adidas! It looks great on you
Sam I'm more of a midi skirts and dresses kinda wearer, if that's a word 😂 and I'm wondering you could do a video of how to style skirts and dresses. I know it's not a common thing, especially living in LA, but it's very hard to find a flattering way to style them. Please consider 😁
Hi Sam <3 i totally imagine you wearing that red boohoo dress with some tights and some thigh highs just in case it got colder.
I love your style! Now I want to go shopping :)
Kinda random but I love your arm chair in your try on shots. WHere is it from????
Yes please give us autumn 🍂 winter ❄️ trends.
the adidas pants looked amazing on you! Kinda liked them more than the other! :)
Always giving out the best haul ever
Literally liked this video 5 seconds in because I know your vids are always fabuloussssss! LOOL xxx
I love it when you have curly hair! I also love it when you have curly hair with some curly bangs! so pretty <3
Why don't you keep the adidas pants to wear casually like when youre going to run errands or walking your dog or something...i always thought those adidas pants were for days when you want to be casual but cool.
I'm not one for trends but I love athleisure. I've been obsessed with an entire Nike, Adidas, etc. outfit with trainers. I feel stylish but super comfy at the same time.
Keep dem Adidas pants...and the &OtherStories ones
100% keep the adidas pants!
Sammi, for me You are IT GIRL
adidas pants is a keeper
You're soooo beautiful ❤
Those &otherstories contrast pants are gorgeous!
Keep the Adidas trousers!!!!!!
KEEP!!!
yeees, the trends video would be awesome! ;)
Great picks!
Too cute.
Keep the Adidas
keep the Adidas bottom.
Keep the adidas!!!!! They look gorgeous:)))
KEEP THOSE ADIDAS PANTS!! 😍😍

Easily this years best song\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
''curve'' with the accent on u & the last e means ,,hoes'' inmy mother language'\n''cur'' also means ''ass'' so...
This is lot but like wtf Gucci? Before the Weeknd dominates his part Gucci says GO! Like boi.
I see The Weeknd, I click 👏🏻👏🏻💕
How does this have 1k dislikes?
The Weeknd is so insanely good on this beat
Why is the spotify version different on gucci verse?
Somebody tell the prince that kingpin has arrived I told him
Here when I saw feat the weeknd :)
how many people are gonna feature abel this year
Gucci is flying, weeknd vibe on this is suave 🍾
Lyrics have changed on Spotify, they updated the song 🔥
Abel carry this is simple
Why the beat sound like a 1950's Movie when the Alien Lands down on Earth  😂
Every feature from the weeknd is more like a feature from the actual artist on a weeknd song loq
The Weeknd goes HARD in this
When you feature Abel on your song, it's not your song anymore.
Shame tht this will be his last good song... then his career will be murdered after his song with jake paul.
Gucci killed his part frfr like if y'all agree
Sound like if Michel jackson did Trap Music Search Quizzy DNA FREESRTYLE!
Clone or Not... I fcuks with Guwop...
Damn this song is just ...

🤣😂🤣 love this video
Go bankrupt or bye the new iPhone
Order of things that are going to be taken away\n\n\n1 headphone jack\n2 home button\n3 volume button (probably gonna be swippin to change volume)\n4 power button ( probably do a gester to turn it on)\n5 speaker/ mic (always wear apple earbuds)\n6 take out metal (make everything glass)\n7 take out hardware (Bluetooth it)\nSkip a few numbers\nLast iPhone will be just a piece of glass with a screen and Bluetooth gear, camera in apple headband and earbuds with mini flashlight on them and the only way to charge it is in the apple pants
Next iPhone would let you play Half Life 3 and it would cost 3000$
Well I guess what Rick beato said was true, apples good if you like shit
When mission impossible no longer needs to scan that dudes face. Cause they just get it from apple.
Why is this so god damn true and funny at the same time?
Basically if you don't buy the ten your not a true apple fan
The radio station I listen to reacted to this.\n\nWhy.
burnn 🔥🔥🔥🔥 the most savage video ive ever seen
What I hate is how dead on the money you are
Hhahahhahhaha so truueeee couldn't of said it better
Lawl, the PC I am building is $1,170 and it is easily 100x more powerful sporting a GTX 1060 6GB and a Ryzen 5 1600.  And a phone now costs that much... this is the future?
I cannot describe how fking amazing this video is jack you are a freaking legend! I'll say it now and I'd say it again this is the best video on YouTube 5 of my friends have rewatched it several times.
If the new IPhone X had a headphone jack and more useful features unlike the fucking 3DS VR game, I'm sure most people would be happy to buy it. Also the price should have been $699 atleast.
You Can't.  Afford it😂
I'm not donating my organs. If you die after buying the iPhone X, then that's your fault.
COULD THIS BE MORE ACCURATE
The worst part is that it’s true..,
1000$ emoji machine😁
iPhone Xpensive
Ordered OnePlus X instead :P
😕
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
LOL
Betcha it's sponsored by audible
Take your iphone 7, AND THROW IT IN THE GARBAGE
Hyped for the emoji movie 2 3d emoji's on the the 1000$ emoji machine
Next thing they take away is gonna be the screen.  *And mark my words, PEOPLE WILL BUY IT!*
iPhone Xnxx
Nigga shut the fuck up
Samtime is better at parody.
Bigger screen better Hentai
Just buy an iPhone iPhone 5
A perfect description.😁
Can't wait for Xx_Šñîpër_Ëłîtė_Phøñê_xX
why buy the iphone x when you can buy 100,000 robux?
Since the beginning we wanted a phone that was all screen without borders Well why does it have more fucking borders than my Galaxy Edge then.
Like 90% of the comments here is Samsung users hating. \nI'm just enjoying the funny parody.
i died at life juice. \n\n\n\n\n\nalso what movie is that scene full of stone faces from? thats twice ive seen it in an iphone x video.
Music is so original never heard it before
What a fucking Cash grab
Parody?More like reality
Watching on iphone 6s🤦🏼‍♂️😂😂🤣
iphone 11 parody would be  whatstevewouldwant
Lmfao boy 😂 this shit funny
Ohh the 1915 Apple fan boys just got burnt....
My mom might buy an iphone X so im gonna mess around with the animating emoji thing
I love the throwback to the old format of your parodies, Jack. Great job.
Apple did it again! So intevatititve
this comment section is full of jealous assholes who cant afford it😂
Yes ! ... Where do I enter my credit card details ?
iPhone X, more like iPhone Xpensive.
Amazing
I suppose you could say that Tim Cook... 'Cooked' the iPhone
I need the subs spanish 😊😊😊
0:64  HAHAHA JUST LIKE A DEMENTOR THANKYOU FOR YOUR LIFE JUCE
Subscribe to Dolan Dark on YouTube
Where was the parody?
1:52\n\n\n\nDidn't know we can fap on iPhone X ;)
I think ill take the \n\n\nNokia 3310
Fuck Tim Cook,i love Steve Job
Not something New that iPhone steal a lot of stuff from galaxy.  Like face lock up and no home button. Galaxy 8+ came out before and it clear iPhone stole ideas.  And many others. I get that Samsung is big company in worldwide and they need make their own ideas not steal and make it their own. People must be stupid not see they are stealing.  Overpricy for phone that stole the ideas. Rip peoples wallet.
every time i think about buying the new iPhone i come here so i would not ..
iPhoneXpensive  \n\n\n\n\nSay hello to the future.\nSay goodbye to your wallet.
IPhone 7: Removes headphone jack. \n\nIPhone X: Removes home button \n\nIphone Y: Removes the screen\n\nIphone Z: Removes all buttons\n\nIphone None: Removes the whole fucking phone (Only for 1999.99 with FREE SHIPPING)
Fuck Apple, going to Samsung, never thought I'd say it.
so what happens if u set a smiley face as your lock screen and all the suddenly you been hit by a car crash.... how do you even open ur homescreen?
Laughed my ass off this whole video🤣
Thanks you for your life juice 
There will be iPhone Casper, just give money and get nothing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you get it
You're wrong the iPhone 8 has wireless charging with a wired pod (innovative af)!
What color I want?  I can't afford it lol
Hey everyone, let's check out SAMTIME's parody, he is a small youtuber with great content.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfjRa7-NviE
Good job. Apple will definitely pay you next time not to make this kinda video :D
Sad thing is, is that this is completely accurate
 you can't  afford it      I died
I need a parody, not an actual commercial
LOL that was fucking awesome, keep up the good work!
1000 dollar emoji machine 😂😂😂😂😂
This is so true!
This video wasn't even that good I mean look at that beautiful screen does that not look sleek and the new 4K 60 fps camera that's amazing it's expensive but I mean it's like 300 dollars more than any other flagship and the processor and face is scanner is two years in front of the competition use your brain
And people would still line up to by this crap .....and call it revolutionary
IPhone X huh. Face ID.. for our security...yeah :) Supercomputers have all our data stored up lmao they can track you anywhere
You all are complainig about the price of the *iphone X*. Meanwhile in sweden people baught samsung *s8+ by 1129 dollar.*\n Ets see gow much will Iphone cost.
1:04 what movie is this from
The saddest part is.. people still buy it... And queue infront the shop for days to get one... Seems pathetic
I hate myself for this but I was VERY torn between buying the iPhone 8 or the x because of the infrared camera I wanted to fuck around with the emojis
gurrrrrlll!! you're trending what what
never be guilty about gingham
Where do you get your hair done???? I love it!
I'd be too worried that my card would be hacked on a site like that
Sad the out of your comfort zone dress had a hole in it! It looked so good!! Also, pirate pants!!! Yay!
I wanted to order from here. But wasn't sure. Great review. Sorry can't be a lady. Lol
Try Popoly next!!
try Dresslily!
The fabric of the white dress is called tweed... or at least they were going for tweed-esque
Help me!! 😂
5:30 just sew it
Can I please have you as my best friend? 😅  I love your videos ❤️
Seriously I was dying when you said stuff sheets and that dress didn't move! Bahahahahahahha
For these exact reasons, this is why I just don't order online. Between my chicken legs and lanky arms and the extremely long waits for disappointment, it's just not worth the hassle. Thank you for confirming my thought process! 💋
I ordered from the Shein site and there were a handful of items worth keeping, but I was not in love with any of them.  The sizing is too inconsistent and it is hard to tell if the item is made with quality material.  Considering the money I spent, and the fact that I only liked a small amount of the clothing, I decided it was not worth it and I won't be ordering anything from them.  I would rather go to the store, try things on and keep what I love.   With the Shein items, there was not anything I really loved and I felt like I just kept what was ok.
I love your personality so much, you crack me up and give me good vibes 😊
I haven't laughed this hard in so long. You are hilarious! I could agree with everything you were saying too, I kept talking back to you 😂😂😂 love your videos always 💕
I think they gingham dress looks good! Also, when you have to report comments because random people are hating #thatshowloveworks
I would recommend trying TOBY. My best friends love it, but I've only tried their formal wear. I'm mean 50% off (for your first purchase) a hot dress for New Years?? Yes pls
That's what happens when leather is bad
She reminds me of grav3yard girl tbh😂😂😂
Rainbow Brite represent!
yaasss trending on youtube
Kys thot
Your video is Trending!!!
White tights under the white striped pants?  And it might help with the credit card issue haha
How can you return the Shein stuff really really quick if it's taken three and one half weeks to get to your house and you were then gone for two weeks?
Thank you for this!!
Я один русский?
I love these videos because you're seriously providing a service🙌🏽 Also you're adorable and I love you but that Chanel dress gives me serious LambChop vibes 🤣 idk why!? #WhyAmILikeThis  great review! 💖
You should consider getting a belly piercing
Do Wish next!
Haha one size fits all is not a thing ok... Go to Asia everything is mostly one size fits all especially South Korea. Which sucks if you are size above US M
You are never a medium! Seriously there is nothing medium about you!! You are one of the thinnest girls I've seen! Very tall- yes.. but not a medium!
Congrats your trending !! :)
that's cancelled hahaha :-)
... You really expected high quality fabrics and pieces from a cheap site? (For example, the black and white checkered looking dress. Girl it was $14, stop trying to act like it should've been such high quality.)
Leighann, sugar, ya live in Houston.  Summer lasts till well into October, seriously!  (I get it, I do, I'm in Houston, too.)
Omg she is sooo fussy all the clothes look fine!!!
Girl you're on the Trending page - you go!!!!  Now more can see how amazing you are. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
You have such a calming presence. Can you just hug me all day?
Video starts @ 2:43
U look like Meghan reiks
Why is this trending
literally thought that was madewell too lol
leighann you need to check out the website shopcamp, its all your retro tshirt dreams come true ✨
I ordered a shirt from them over 5 weeks ago and shipping says its sitting in China. they gave me a $2 credit for how long its taking. So glad I only spent $9.
maybe the last dress could be made into a long shirt?
Keep the bigger items and wash them.  They might shrink 😊
Yeah that sweater would fit me like a bra lol looks really cute on you
I really like these kind of videos. That blue dress, the stiff sheet one, it was so stiff you could even hear how stiff it was, it was so noisy lol!
1. reorder the white dress 2. wear the pants with nude underwear and you won't notice 3. wear a belt with the shorts
Brandy Melville is a one-size fits all brand.
There is a site where everything is 5.99..you should try that..I found some good stuff
you are very cute.
I gotta get a card with a alias.. Can't trust the internet..
I can''t stand the one size fits all concept. Its incredibly misleading and its encouraging to see influencers who also don't see the point of it!
I'm out here thinking it's that lady from Scubs
Love these haul/testing videos!! <33 It would mean so much to me if you watched one of my videos!
p.s. I don't know what the sites are off the top of my head, but i know there are a lot of scammy style bridesmaids dress sites. It might be cool to do a bridal themed style of this video
Yay!!!!  Leighann trending!!  Y'all need in on this!!  Subscribe!!
I love the smell of paint, maybe not toxic but yeah
Am I the only one who gets irked by her complaints when she looks perfect and super fit in every single thing? Like I get it, I don't like alot of clothes either but that's because I'm pudgy and muffin tops happen no matter what
Inu inu is a scam lol the material is so low quality
You should do Cupshe. I see a lot of cute stuff on there but am too scared and picky to try it. I loved the rainbow dress on you! Too bad it was see through.
leighann you *are* a lady <3
Before I buy anything online I check if you did a Try-On.\nLove Your Videos!!
Her looking like a mess is better than myself after getting ready for two hours lmao
Wtf do u buy gucci? That stuff is good.
Any other small YouTube channels out there?
Those pjs look so cute! I want them ❤️
You should really keep the orange striped one it looked really pretty on you
I ordered from Shein once and would never do it again. I knew Shein from a fashion blogger name Jessica (hapatime). Their materials are terrible. I believe Shein is located in Asia (Singapore, as I remember). I didn't even bother to return the clothes but gave away to my friends. Just don't even bother to order from this site. Boohoo or Lulus have better quality
That blue dress at the end reminded me a little bit of a black blouse you used to have wayyyyyyyyyy back when that I loveddd. It had kindofa detail like that in the front too
You should try Fairy Season!
I thought she put Shein for Scam, she in
Great video! Just bought from them, hopefully it'll be okay
I laughed thru this whole video you are hilarious 😂. And I was on break at work watching it and I was late going back oops! ❤️❤️
I love your channel and think you're so sweet but I really hate these kinds of videos. You should provide more research into where these clothes come from, why their so cheap, not just are they O.K. quality. To think about the sweatshops and chemicals that these cheap clothes all come from is appalling and you should cover those bases before promoting the clothes, because that's the true price tag (although the hidden one) that should be more considered. Love your channel, again, just wish you could consider that or talk about it.
I love your hair!
All I can say is gawd that bawd!
More try on hauls from scammy sites please!
I've been successful with some bathing suit purchases from Shein. Their high waisted bikinis are so cute.
Shein, romwe, zaful, etc., are in no way a scam. They just have generic clothes in low quality material. If u mostly shop on these site then u either have a bad sense of fashion or ur just broke. I used to have 10 items from Shein n only 1 that i like. The rest r in the local goodwill.
Currently watching off my\nPhone I live in Florida and I am on day #6 of no power, your video gave me a little normalcy for today thbak you
Your dog.... melts... my heart 8:48
I remember Rainbow Brite! She was totally WAAAAAY before my time.
I would love to see you do a Wish haul but instead of clothing you could do beauty/makeup products and tools!
Please try Zaful next! It's a similar website but delivery takes about 1.5 to 2 weeks so not as bad!
LOL I'm a kindergarten teacher 😂😂
I assumed your top was just following the pajama-inspired trend, didn't realize it was actual pajamas! So cute 💕
I love how you have a is this a scam? hairdo, lol.
I stay away from those sites. The best quality clothing site imo is ASOS.
Hi Leighann, I live in Maine so cozy sweaters are high on my list this time of year. Lightinthebox.com looks like they have what I have been looking for, but it seems scammy. Want to check it out?  😁
I love that you test these websites out for us!! 👐 i love your sense of humor!! you are so funny 😂
Pump and dump
Your trending gurl!! 💗💗👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Bone her kiss kiss
Wow you look like that nun from American horror story (also Shein is a bad website I order clothes and they came 2 months later and they didn't even fit. I'm a small person but jeez it's not good)
You'r so negative omg - I got a lot of stuff from shein and I love them all
Masterpiece music video. Did you also program the robots?
So great. Who says robots are not creative?! (Okay with a bit of help)
What happens when you teach robots to play music but you are also mad
This is one of the best things I have ever seen!!!!
awesome! if it truly robots play. \nhow did you delete its motors sound?
You are a Genius man 👍👍 i love  your art
i'd like to see the making of
This is absolutely stunning. I'm speechless.
it's the 10th time I see this vídeo on the last 4 hours. Can't stop revisiting it... It makes me want to create new accounts just to give out more thumbs up.\n\nThe music is perfect. And the vídeo... It's not only the the artistical effect (with the special effects in the end), but the trouble to create those perfectly synced Kukas creating a wonderfull sound and almost dancing with it...
when super-intelligence AI occurs and becomes aware of its true abilities! Rise of the machines
EPIC STUFF! Congratulations! How much of this video is Real using KUKA robotics and how much CGI ?
your song like me because this is my favourite type of music
2:26 is where the EXTREME begins!!! And then 3:07 is BOMB!! Awesome work!!!
Another question, who's doing your vocals?  she's got a really suitable voice for your type of music.
my GOD! this is FANTASTIC!
Amazing Nigel!!!!  PS. 2:47 does that robot really play that sequence????
Where is captian disillusion when you need him.
Congratulations, Nigel. As a senior citizen, I find it a breath of fresh air and thoroughly inspiring. However, I was reminded by another 'oldie' that it can never be to everyone's taste. Their comment took me back to Robert Moog in the 1960s when they said, What's the world coming to! Great work, mate!
awesome!! They need to give you a show in Vegas immediately!
at least you know skynet can be cool while taking over the world
Inspiration fuel for sure. Been going between editing a film I shot and listening to your music. I love it! Never stop!
Can those robots actually move that fast and steadily? I thought this was 3D animation at first but apparently it isnt?
#nigelstanford once again, out does himself!!! i thank my mom for turning me onto to your music, a staple on my phone. just amazing nigel!!
this is so fucking insane!! i'm speechless, congrats
Amazing! It's great!
Haha! Seven year ago I worked in the KUKA manufacture... and i was play on guitar to ten years, nowadays I'm a filmmaker and I love your stuff wery well! This video and the music is Awesome! 👊👏
это великолепно!! не останавливайтесь !!!!
Это просто афигенно, мурашки по коже)
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways\nIt's still rock and roll to me (Billy Joel) ;-)

Woah.. feeling vibes of moby, the prodigy, the crystal method n Roland jenkees 😁
Great video. However due to all the CGI, I cannot be sure if the robots actually played anything.
One sided questions. What about the other candidate calling young black men super predators? What about Obama and every other candidate also fighting illegal immigrants? What about abortion targeting blacks? What about democrats running poor inner cities? What about Trump meeting with black leaders and why not talk about Ben Carson? I have never had as much respect for an athlete as I do Floyd right now. Floyd Mayweather, thank you for changing millions of views and waking people up.
DACA people have no right to be here.. They take money away from American children and families they then take jobs away from American children and families... It must end. The wall must be built and I have a ton more respect for Floyd Mayweather after this.. Trump the man.. He is doing what needs to be done to make this country the country of excellence it wants to be.. No more lowered standards and free handouts to people that hate us.. That all ends.. Its AMERICA FIRST from now on!
Respect to him... that seems like a real man right here!
see as a latino. There is only one kind of politics that effects me directly. Money.\n\nI see politics this way. Who wants to put more hands in your wallet? Politically it is the Democrats who want to turn you upside down and take you for everything.\n\nImagine, just imagine, if Sanders would of won. TMT would have to pork up 80% or 90% of this mans labor! \n\nThis is why folks like Trump do not scare me at all. Democrats scare the hell out of me.
Anyone else but me notice that black men that are lazy, ghetto, and criminals vote Democrat and blacks that have their shit together, are successful, don't make excuses and work hard vote Republican?  That's because the Republican ones don't cry like bitches and wait for hand outs; they get shit done. The Democrat ones lop around at home waiting for their EBT money.  #Trump #Mayweather #WorkHard
Moral of the story: stop worrying about everyone else and do for self. Like he said and for 99% of us, ain't nobody gonna give us shit.
The host is so dumb new legislation to get rid of the dreamers.\n\nThat's the opposite of what's happening lol, Trump is giving Congress 6 months and the opportunity to *save* the dreamers. They'll most likely stay, and it'll be codified into law, an IMPROVEMENT over what Obama gave them.\n\nDreamers will be thanking Donald Trump.\n\nYes DACA will end but it was never constitutional anyway.
holy fuck i used to hate this guy now hes awesome
Dumb fucking people worried about who the fucking president is
Thanks God, finally a smart celebrity. God bless May weather.
Mayweather is real and he has courage
Wtf I like this guy now
love him!!!  ppl don't like the truth
He is the real Dreamer.
Does anyone have the few minutes after this? I can't find it on their channel just part 1
Funny to see all these trump supporters on here giving big ups to Floyd cause it sounds like he defending your guy Trump but if obama was in office for all of you who complained about him he saying the same about you as well
This the realest nigga I ever heard in my whole life.   Why the fuck black people worried about dreamers?   What the fuck is that gon do for you?   The Democrat Party has turned us all into bitch niggaz and we can't even see it.  Trump may be racist, but if he is he is a lot less racist than Killary and yall know this!   Floyd is on that man shit and the rest of us need to grow the fuck up.
So,  with this dumb Coon's logic,  he should be tripping over $35,000,000 in taxes when he's making over $350,000,000 a year,  thats merely a scratch in the bank.  No shit the average person making $30,000 would be trippin over paying $5,000 in taxes,  Poorer still gets poorer.
he talks like he is retarded, but that mofo made all the sense in the world. Stop bitching and moaning about how u are unfortunate and do something about your life. USA is an amazing country with insane amount of opportunities for one and all to flourish. If u fuck up, its probably ur fault.
Floyd needs to check his white privilege!!!!......oh wait?
No white pepole there where's the white brother ????
The host is full of shit.
Trump wasn't a racist until he ran for president Thank you Floyd for calling out all the idiots.
Two over the top successful black men, Charles Barkley and Floyd Mayweather, are saying the same thing...listen up!  Concentrate on what you can control...your life, your achievement.   If everyone did that including the illegals, problems would take care of themselves.  It's NOT the GOVERNMENT that determines your success.  It's YOU!  If you didn't vote, you shouldn't complain.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M9vnv5qIFQ
oh you blessed... pssst... he shut that bitch up quick though...  I WORKED my ass off... didn't no body give me nothin... whole time they want people beggin for crumbs and blamin 'whitey' for oppressing em into failure... Mayweather's life and verdal testimony kills every argument they create...
Most of the most hysterical protesters k ow nothing of his policies. Ppl hate Trump bc they hate HIM. It isn't his policies. The host if full of sh*t. Mayweather is speaking the truth.
The race hustlers in the room don't care that he's telling them that they have to do it themselves, they have to personally make their lives happen, they're selling the hustle....cause it's easy work selling the politics of envy and promises of government largesse. \n\nThe cavalry isn't coming. Save yourself or it will not happen.
Mayweather a real dude. Like this dude even more now
Looks like another knockout to me
The only time I agree with mayweather on anything
Trump didn't say he actually he grabbed a woman by her you-know-what. He said THEY'LL LET YOU GRAB THEM BY THEIR P__Y because you have a lot of money and that's what some women do when they're in the presence of famous.
These people are lost and they need to listen to Floyd. He's telling them to stop feeling sorry for yourselves. Stop trying to blame everyone else for your problems. Get up off of your a$$ and do something with your life instead of spending your life assigning blame and complaining. Floyd is a winner in life
You can't become one of the richest athletes in the world if your stupid. Floyd is extremely smart, and he's dropping some real wisdom right here.
Awesome!
AMERICA BECOMES A MESS AFTER A TERM FROM ANY DEMOCRAT PRESIDENT! NEVER EVER VOTE A DEMOCRAT ❗️
FUCKING BBAAAYYYYYSSED
Woke AF
LOL at all of them not saying shit against him because they'll be thrown off the money train they freeload on. They didn't expect that response, did they? Anyone else would be called a racist KKK member.
5:11 chick didn't hear a word Mayweather said. He did not live a blessed life! He worked his ass off. He put everything into making himself better. Dumb beeyach!
Lesson is people should focus less on news, politics and other people in general, and much more on themselves and how to make money. That's a good lesson, only thing is 99.99% of people are working for low or average wages and not for hundreds of millions in 36 minutes... 99.99% of people wont retire at 40, will work hard as fuck and still take the bus instead of riding a Bugatti. So that's a good lesson but it has its limits.
Floyd had integrity, mad respect for him! Stop complaining and get your lazy ass to work trumpaholics!
Mayweather knows what's up. He grabbed the whole damn world by the pussy.
real talk, never seen a mayweather interview, much respect
Fuck that bitch at the end trying to diminish this man's accomplishments. She just mad cause she defined her own success as ho.
Man, I dont agree with the last fight but Floyd just got a 51-0 on my card.
Mayweather is speaking truth.
GOAT
Smart man right there
real talk
*BLACK CELEBS THAT SUPPORTED TRUMP!*\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by-ler2Ly44
yes, refer political wisdom from mayweather
Mad respect for Mayweather. The black community on the far left will now call him a traitor, uncle tom, coon, and everything else because he has a different opinion than them.
#WINNINGOVERWHINING
I agree wholeheartedly with Floyd. The Left HATES American exceptionalism. They HATE the fact that capitalism has produced the richest, most free society the world has ever known. They HATE that Capitalism creates outcomes based on effort and personal responsibility. They HATE that the system in the US allows one to determine their own destiny. \n\nHere is the thing about DACA: Only Congress can make immigration law (Article I; Section 8). So when Obama created DACA, through an Executive Order, he went around Congress illegally. Everyone knew that as soon as BO was no longer President that DACA could be rescinded. So by going around Congress (which has debated and voted against similar bills for 2 decades now) President Obama gave amnesty to illegals that he knew he was unable to give. So instead of blaming Trump (who Im not a fan of) maybe we should blame Obama who gave something he was unable to give OR blame the parents who made their iwn children party to their illegal activity (sneaking into the country). We never worry about breaking up American families when a black father sells drugs or a white father robs a store so non-citizens shouldn't get a free pass for breaking the law either.
it affects everyone because we're going to make america great again. liberals are all woe is me, welfare, dont want to work hard or try, expect life to fair and easy, and most of all dont know shit about nothin'!  they cant say anything except the last thing they hear on fake news but dont understand reality. they have no lives, they're not worth a million, they dont make life or death decisions, they cant grind for 16 hours a day, oh i had enough food today yeah i got enough water I guess im alright, thats all they accomplish do you hear me. there is so much work but there aint nobody that can do it, there is no such thing as a free lunch. the world is getting so damn soft and socially unacceptable. celebrities are not role models either. you got to do it for you not because you think there's a status to it or it makes a certain amount of money.
Total respect for the guy now... That's right dumbasses... TRUMP WAS NEVER CALLED A RACIST UNTIL HE BECAME PRESIDENT!! Do you like how they wanted to try and put them back in their box and he kept knocking them out with logic? ;)
He is not sending kids back but ok ... good shit mayweather
much respect for F.M. jr.! truth as it is.unbiased
People love to hate Floyd, but he is a smart guy.  Respect.
I don't like the man as a person at all, but he isn't wrong about anything he said in this interview.
Good for him. TRUMP 2020!!!
My man Mayweather!
I loved when he put that bitch in her place when she said he lives a blessed lifestyle. The man clearly worked his ass off to get to where he is. I don't like the way Floyd fights, but he is pretty down to earth.
Mayweather just earned my respect. \nStrange timeline indeed!
Before the McGregor fight, I always thought of Mayweather as a showboat. After he beat down McGregor, my view of him changed slightly in a positive way. Now after watching this video, I have a lot of respect for him. You can see those brainwashed on the plantation pepole in that room starting to get triggered but were at a loss for words. They couldn't believe a black man was speaking of Trump in a positive view. As a Hispanic I can totally confirm what he is saying about these immigrants who are ungrateful hate this country and but won't go back to their home country even though they are always talking about how great it is there. They way I look at is, if the dreamers want to stay, they should take a course on the US constitution, pay a fee and then have to do 4 years of military service. Not all of these dreamers are kids anyway. A lot are late teens, 20's and 30's.\n\nThey system is afraid of the minority groups getting woke to the the real manipulation. They would rather have you believing in their version of being woke: Divide and conquer, race and ethnic politics, etc.
Floyd is too real for this show. They try to pull him down into the muck because that's all they know how to do?
this guy makes a lot of sense . hope all the idiots start listening to a real winner .
Mayweather should stick to boxing instead of giving his ignorant opinions. Real men don't talk about sexully assaulting women and real men don't hit women. Trump might not be a racist but his policies are institutionally racist.
FLoyd should be Honorary American of the Year
If I was Black , and was like how I am now (Meaning same in Spirit (just happen) to be White, I better not be called a 'Coon' for dressing up nice, working Overtime, being a good Uncle or Father, eating good foods, helping others and working out.  Then I would  feel like I did as a kid being picked on by other kids,  that is the definition of a BULLY\nGod forbid you have an opinion about something....  so because a lot of  Italians wear gold jewelry and I don't ,  that don't make me the slang term equivalent of a Coon for what an Italian doing something like that would be...does it ?\nThat's like saying if I get a German Shepard, instead of a Pit-Bull,  I'm suddenly a 'Coon'   Fuck outta here,  its called I don't conform to society and follow others, its called.... I can think for myself.  \n\nIts judging people because if you say someone is a 'Coon' , that is Racist in itself unless there is something full blown pure support for something that would be evil or against the law...like a Black person supporting the KKK is Ironic and that would I suppose make someone a 'Coon'.....  but what the hell would be a good example ??    Supporting the Republican Party ?   well there again that would be judgmental and Racist, since even though I am sure there are racist Republicans, I bet there are racist Democrats too.\nIn the end,  anyone calling someone else such a name is a Bully or just all together jealous.
Exactly how do you hold someone running for president to a higher standard for something he said in a private conversation that was secretly recorded then released years later?  Set em straight Floyd!
People are going nutz because Mayweather didn't jump on the anti-trump bandwagon and embrace the victim-narrative.. he 'worked' from the bottom-to-the-top (50-0) 'everyone' who puts their mind to it can do that.. a new found 'respect' for this man.. Outstanding Floyd!
Respect
Mayweather knows his shit.
He wasn't running for President 12 years ago when he mentioned grabbing the pussy.
That dumb slag backpedalled furiously when he stomped her the fuck down for implying he had been gifted a 'privileged' life. They are always the same. Gutless cowards when they get called out on their deceit.
A rational man and a REAL American. Only weak bitches get caught up in everybody elses fights. Fight your own fights and stop being offended for other people. You didn't put dreamers in this situation. Their parents did. Obama only made it worse. Time to correct the problem one way or another and throwing rocks ain't gonna help.
Tell it floyd!!!
3:29 ...the new legislation they are putting forward to get rid of dreamers...totally WRONG.  There is no legislation about that at all.  It was a an executive order from Obama that Trump gave congress six months to figure out until it expires.  These liberals are so uninformed and indoctrinated by our media.
Now all the black people that was PRO Mayweather will turn on him. His boxing style sucks to watch but he's 100% right with Trump.  All the people are shocked like they were talking to a murderer.....
I am a white supremacist, and I'm a pussy grabber, and I lubed up America's asshole and lit Putin's cigarette when he finished fucking the election - so what?  I'm not losing any supporters.  \nSo suck my baby carrot, America.  I moved on you like a bitch.
I totally agree with Floyd.  100%
Hah!  Floyd rocks!  Thanks for posting this.  I wish you had posted the whole interview tho.Floyd kept on talking about the individual.  That's what this country is about; individuals, not identity groups.
Floyd is the American dream, he came from nothing to become the greatest, respect
Real talk, if you can't handle the truth that's your problem...everything he said is true.
A positive message from Floyd. That took some balls. New respect for him.
Not a fan a Mayweather as a boxer, but I give him much respect for speaking out on this.
Fuking host talking shit he don't even do his research on, just more talking points pushing false narrative. Trump put DACA back on the table for it to be negotiated and law like shits supposed to be, not dictated like B.O. Overreach
Well put Floyd! You sir are a great American.
FUCK THE DREAMERS!
Mah nigga!!
Floyd is the black man's Trump and Floyd's nuthuggers are the black Trumptards of boxing.
Floyd Mayweather isn't dumb as most people portray him. They will give a forner a loan before a black person. Very true.
Mayweather is Conservative even though he is black. lol. He talked about how IRS should use his tax $ for disasters (So why he has to donate?) & now he says Trump talks like a real man.
I agree 100% with the money man.
wheres the full version of this
Fuck trump worst President ever agree
I don't know when Youtube got full of fake accounts, but it's surely full of them now. I honestly don't see anything wrong with what Floyd said. But Floyd definitely ignored the elephant in the room.... most black people are genetically inferior when it comes to intelligence. People have tried to cover this up for decades, but the science is no longer deniable. There are SOME intelligent African Americans, some.... but the majority lack the genetic ability to truly become more intelligent people. The media tries to hide this daily... but look at the protests. The constant whining. The low graduation rates. The lack of success at historically black colleges compared to other institutions. The faster people understand that we're all different in one way or another, the faster we can do the right thing for America.
Floyd is as fake as his Conor McGregor fight...trump is a racist and Floyd dances for him.
Why would anyone care about what Mayweather thinks? Mayweather is a stupid boxer, that is probably illiterate. Who cares what he thinks.
This kid is going to be so freaking smart! He started out in this world learning 3 languages! I can barely speak English man!

Tiffs reaction made me tear up
Anyone find it weird that David gave geo a kiss on the cheek at 7:47?
i at least wanted them to add a gun flash effect
this was a good video but those fake ass sound effects were more annoying than immersive. Honestly if you're adding the sound might as well add the muzzle flash into the mix.
Ok count to 20 to revive, 12345 that was like 1 second xD

Why it's so long to kill their enemies are they noob
matt was the best a god damn legend right there
Where is D's chicken dinner!!
Watching how they were walking in the open, not using cover, etc was giving me PTSD.
If I was to do this, who would be my teammate?
It's been like 6 years since an airport video
this pubg-airsoft is so fckung man i am vomiting every ti he say's contact.\nyou should stop :/

Just to say, the sound for guns good sometimes, you hear the m416 for the m16 and etc
How does this have 1k dislikes this is lit!
Marks unanswered cry for help mixed with the music playing right after his death, made that moment intense af and film worthy tbh.
God damn wish I could play airsoft with jet God damn it no fair can never do anything fun
Watch my video and let me know what you think

i like this better than the other one... the vibes here are real (y) but where's mikey?
when they ran away at the end it's like mega nostalgic.
The new fucking army of one direction
Wow I think I'm a fan now dang they are gonna be a big thing along with WHY DONT WE ...this is dope
IM SO HAPPY TO BE STARTING THIS FANDOM JOURNEY SO EARLY IM NEVER THIS EARLY
And did they lowkey sample Poison by Bell Biv DeVoe?
Ok i'm not hating on these boys but simon if u think this is the new one direction u best fucking believe it isn't nobody can replace one direction. and before y'all start hating on me it's my opinion
OMG! LOVE THE VIDEO!!! AND, I LOVE YOUGUYS!!! 💗😘
DOWNLOAD IT HERE: WOULD YOU MIND” MUSIC VIDEO http://mp3alive.net/prettymuch-premiere-mind-music-video/
I have been waiting for this 😈
Hands down the best song I've heard since the 90s when it comes to group music. This is like early backstreet boys nsync good. Mannn. I will be doing a track wit y'all one day   Ant Jonez
i hate that i like this song
this actually sounds so good
I think I'm in love
I'm a directioner...i dont like them but i respect talent and they have talent.. i like this song....song is so good  but still i dont like pretty much.
You guys deserve better, much love😊
No joke my favorite song
This is the new one direction
Me: eh they aren't why dont we. Boi bye
WHY DON'T WE IS BETTER!!!!!😆
dang this is pretty good
I'm fall in love with this Song ❤
Tbh they look more spontaneous  than In real life  they need more views
Trust me, these guys are gonna blow up.
Quick question:\nWhich do ya guys love the most?\n\nIn Real Life\n\nWhy don't we\n\nPrettyMuch
I LOVE YOU GUYS WOW THIS IS AMAZING
THEY ALL LOOK SO GOOD OH MY GOD YES
did anyone else come here from a snapchat ad ? 😂
This song Is so nice cant wait for a new song, hope you will blow up af!
Just another generic boy band created and managed by greedy Simon Covell who obviously needs earn some cash and since 1D is done Simon is back with their lame version :D Bravo Simon You are was always best at discovering fuckboys :D
this was on the radio in ctl, NC when we were taking shelter from Irma,\ni thought the song was fucking awesome and also found this video \nwin-win ‼️🤘🏽
I really love you so much
This is so good you guys 😭😍
this is like a total replica of late 80s / early 90s NKOTB stuff mixed with a dash of kpop ... and i love it!
DAMN CAN I JUST MARRY LIKE ALL OF THEM PLZ
lets not kid ourselves... PRETTYMUCH is way better than In Real Life. More personality, better fashion, better music...
bad parody of one direction :(
i love you guys already
I JUST FELL IN LOVE ALL OVER AGAIN. I FREAKING LOVE THIS MUSIC VIDEO 😻😻😻😻
Just amazing ... BEANZ are sooo proud with you boys ,keep going...👆👑❤️👏
i disliked this even before it started ! XD
There are 2 biggest Fandoms over here(in the comments section)\n1. One Direction\n2. Prettymuch
Is this the NewNew Edition?....oh you're too young? You don't know? Check them out, everything is recycled. Good NewNew sound though.
I don't like when some people said that thay are like k pop boy group,  I don't think so , because thay are pretty much, they can sing , dance and dont need  makeup , more manly then kpop bands. It's reality. I dont say that kpop groups are bad, just i dont like when they act like children .
ughhh. boy bands have been disastrous over the last 10 years.. why can't we have the 90's and early 00's back??
I would love for Zion to make it better for me❗😫❤❤❤
HERE GOES ALL MY MONEY....
I'm so here for it I'm so glad I can be one of the firsts 😛✨
Here at 238,457 view (before they blow up)!
Honestly this video is everything
Who's the one with the glasses 🌚🌚🌚
It feels like the 90's are making a comeback!
Y'all are pretty much killing it 😂👌🏼😏
A couple days I heard you on the radio, and I was freaking out. Lmaooo
does the blonde kid have any lines at all? genuinely curious because i love this song but i also love equal distribution!!
you guys should listen hurtsgood by R5 is prettygood too
OMG Brandon and Zion is so sexy😍😍
the best thing about you all is you guys have fun with each other I see a future for all of u guys you guys are also so real with ur fans Simon Cowell has done well
honestly, I am so not a Boyband girl. but yeez I am falling in love with this band.... <3
dear whoever handle of prettymuch, please upload the full 'dancing in the rain' video, thanks.
The song is goof song. Its easy on ears and I will probably hear to it willingly but god The mv is so not my thing. I don't like mv at all but i like the song and that's what matters anyways.
Yes, I would mind.
people judged them too fast saying their the fake 1D all of them are amazing people in their own ways❤️
Loving the 90's N-Sync vibe
best video of 2017 work it guys
im not usually into any boy bands or their music but I actually really like this song
BEEN A FAN BEFORE THE BLOW UP <333 \nwhen u come to the video look at brandons sexy face. Hes so hot. Like if you believe brandon is hot :3 follow me and my bestie on IG: @elitebeanz @brandonarreagathebee
How didn't I hear it before ?! This is seriously good. Can't wait for more
I'm new 💕. Who is who lol. All I know is Brandon and he is cute af
See that scene where they're sitting in the rain? It's the tears of pride I've cried for the boys.\nSO HAPPY FOR MY BABIES!!!!
who and what is this ??? And where can I get more!!! XD <3
Anyone get that Backstreet boy Vibe or is it just me.
looks like a korean boyband, much better one direction. why, because members like more master dancing than singing 😂😂
Better than kpop they dance better and have more talent \n\n\nBefore debut kpop : they train until they dance perfectly and learn flips and stuff plus go on a strict diet like no noodles or bread \nBefore debut pop : dancing skills dont matter but they practice alot\n\n\n\nStill love the song though
I WAS HERE BEFORE 1MIL
DYINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG OMFG I REALLY LOVE PRETTYMUCH, THIS VIDEO IS KILLINGME, PERFECT

Wannabe one direction
Gay
I was honestly thinking those shoes are so tall, how does she walk in those? Right before Tan fell 🙈
Where are your sunglasses from😍
Tanya, for what it's worth, I think it worked out better that you had to wear your trainers, especially when it came to taking photos with everyone. That SAME thing has happened to me in high heels and, oh my gosh, the pain was terrible! I actually relived it watching this. In fact, I had to look away when you showed the photo when it happened. Glad you're ok!
What Jim wants is a pasta or salad bowl, which both have low sides: http://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/food-drink/best-pasta-bowl-marks-and-spencer-habitat-denby-royal-doulton-a7043676.html
What was the mac lipstick colour you where wearing at the event? I NEED!💗
Loving the new camera
I would love to know how to shop for your shape, or if you even think about it at all! I love your style
Where we you having coffee..looked really nice in the terrace area?
Love the dress, sunnies \nSo pretty \nYou look gorgeous \n\nLove this vlog
Show us the mirror you buy for your stairway Tan when you get it.love things like that.xx
You are a delight.....!🌟🌟🌟
please do a fall wadrobe video ♥♥♥
I did the exact same thing in shoes with an ankle strap! It was ligaments in my leg just like you described not the ankle at all really! Ouch!
Where is your footstool from?? love it!!
You need to throw away those shoes! Regardless the price! They're dangerous! 😂
You are a great person and I hope your ankle is better be blessed!!!
Love you so much!!💗💗💗💗
Tanya, I've been watching your videos for about 2 years now, and I honestly keep forgetting that you're well-known or 'famous' or however people want to put it. It's not at all that I don't think you should be :D (obviously, because you're so lovely and talented and beautiful, and the list goes on...) but it's just that you are so down to earth and modest! I mean it would seem obvious that many people love you because of YouTube, but ironically, even while I'm watching you on YouTube, you seem more like a friend than someone on my computer screen who so many other people also follow.\nJust thought I would share what was on my mind :P I'm sure many of you, watching, can relate!\nHope that makes sense. Haha!
Where are your sunglasses from? They are so gorgeous 😍
Look for pasta bowls! Think that's what jim's  after
Rolled ankles take longer to heal than broken because they arent casted. Wrap it and ice it. Don't wall on it for 2 weeks or else it will Never heal!!! Ice and bed rest and crutches for you. Plus pnce you injure your ankle that ankle will be prone to injuries for he rest of your life had the same thing happen to me
The focus is really good. Good 🎥
Never knew they personalized Yorkshire tea! My dad works at Taylors of Harrogate and makes those and I never knew, I love Yorkshire tea!
You look beautiful Tan. I hope your ankle feels better. Please look into a plant based diet as you dont need to kill to cook and no life need be taken for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Love your channel, Ive been following you for the last 7 or 8 years. Take care of Jim and Martha. ❤❤❤
My best friend and I were so happy we were able to meet u.  Love u sooo much 💕😍😘❤️
You look so lovely Tan, that dress is one of the nicest outfits I've seen. When I saw those shoes I thought they looked dangerous, had some similar and did exactly the same last year. Tore ligaments and was hobbling around for weeks , all the way through a holiday in Dubrovnik! You're a trouper for not crying lol and powering through!
How gorgeous you look in that dress!
what is the lipstick your wearing??? ❤
Tan's vlogs are the best <3
I've preordered your book Tanya x
I feel your pain! I fell and sprained my ankle in July and it took ages to heal. Hope you're feeling better already!
great vlog love! xo from my channel to your’s <3
I've pre ordered your book and ordered your xmas calendar
10:38 she get's her ankle bruised 😟
What sunglasses did you have on?
I have so much respect for you! I can't believe you did a meet and greet with a sprained ankle! Take care of yourself Tan 😢❤😚
this dress looks AMAZING on you
The red dress is so flattering on you!!!
Love this so much!! Tanya we love youuuu!!!! Check out my new vids xxx
5:20 - I think he's looking for a soup plate then. Love your taste in home ware!  xx
Sounds weird but your teeth urghhh I'm so jealous 😕❤️
That dress is gorgeous and oh so feminine! 😍
Out of interest, how much tea does the average Brit consume a day and why do they love it so much?
You inspire me so so much, your my hero. You make me so happy every time I watch you, you make me smile. I've been watching you for 2 years now and since I get really stressed and have anxiety I have loved to come home every week excited to watch your videos and have something to look forward to, like a reward. Thank you for just doing what you do, you are amazing and have really helped me get through tough times. 💕🙂
Hope your ankle is better👍✳️👍✳️👍✳️
can u do more what i eat in a day videos i love them !!
Hey Tan, your so inspiring! Thank you die uploading a new video! But when i read the title i that you were going to talk about mentally getting hurt and i would be interested to hear you talk about that! Xx
Love the new Vlog camera! 💗
Omg I'm in your vlog ahhh I'm so happy 😁✨🙌 it was nice to meet you at reserved
Great video! What card holder did you have in your bag? After one and yours looked perfect as it had a zip for change too. Xx
I have the exact kind of bowl you need and bought it in John Lewis.  Eat my pasta and stir-fries in it.  Sorry I can't photograph it - it's in my London flat- but it's white and perfect.  BTW you always look amazing, I love your make-up line and the make-up you're wearing today.  Would that be Woodwinked eyeshadow from MAC?  Lots of love from me Kate xxx, and from my five yo daughter Maya xxx who is your biggest fan and loves baking your cakes ❤
PLEASE tell me where your sunglasses are from!!!! Omg they are to die for.
I JUST LOVED WHEN U SAID MOROCCO; YOU MADE MY DAY TANYA <3  ! LOVE FROM MOROCCO !
The book you held up, Conversations with Friends, is currently on my bedside table. I am just getting into reading it! I bought it in Paris when on a girls vacation with my best friend. Tanya, I hope you enjoy reading it when you get time 😄
I'm already getting excited for Vlogmas. Am I the only one? The shopping in the beginning just gave me the Vlogmas vibe :D
Aww loved this video Tanya! You look stunning in this video
Where did they go for breakfast? Looks stunning!
oh my goodness - seeing a meet and greet like that shows how exhausting it must be! and on a twisted ankle too! you are awesome, tan <3
I love Kate's outfit! Does anyone know where her coat is from? :) x
Coach nude patent loafers would have been comfortable and looked great with your dress.
Oh wow! It's so weird seeing the meet n greet in fast forward!!
I can't wait for your Christmas Vlogs!!!!!!!
Love that red dress. I felt your pain when you fell. I've sprained my ankle twice and it's not fun. Glad yours wasn't that bad
So amazing to see you loving  my national clothing brand 💓
I love your vlogs so much 💜
I love all the reserved pieces you picked out! Great vlog <3
Love youre vlogs specaily when there long! So sad for youre enkel but i hope it feels fine soon!:) And i can't wait till vlogmastime this year❤️🎄 And i am watching youre old vlogmas back so cozy^^ xxx
Ahhhh loved the dress so much on you that I just ordered it straight away! You poor poppet with your ankle, I so felt for you, I hate falling over so totally got that you felt a bit shook up! Hope it was okay after your busy day! X
Did You know that Reserved is from Poland?
Love the new camera xxx
OMG!!! I love those glasses!!! Beautiful and they look so amazing on you! xoxox
I think you might have lightly twisted your ankle there Tan. So I think you resting it is probably good, also should have picked up a compression bandage.
Well wishes for your ankle lovely! Try a heat compress.
Probably a sprain, so if it's really swollen and bruised wrap it and it'll be better in and week or two
Oh my goodness where did you get your sunglasses, they are the exact pair I've been looking for??!
Don't you just love when people have actual meaningful conversations with you?!?! I think It's the best, love meeting new people.
Hi Tan! Loved your vlog as per! Bit random but I wanted to make a recommendation for shallower bowls if you're still looking for them lol, Sophie Conran has the most beautiful wider, shallower white ridged bowls that are fab for stir fries & pasta etc. Zoë x
Amazing vlog ♥
<3
What vlogging camera is this?
love the  outfit
Hey! Amrit pal is ginger :)
good👍
Trending number 2
SECOND ON TRENDING 😇😇😇😇😇💜
My tour tickets came today!!
Looking so lovely Tanya ❤️
Love your dress! X
Going to Reserved  tomorrow!
sunglasses!!!
love your dress! sorry your ankle got hurt
Does anyone know if Tan's lips are naturally that size or if she has lip injections/something like that?  She has the most beautiful lips and they look extremely natural.
I love the lip color you're wearing, what is it please?
Oh no! This has sold out in my size- I wanted to wear this red dress for a bridesmaid dress!
To the girl (anyone who knows) at 15.05 where are stripe trousers from? Maybe like so more people can see? Thanks!
Hey tan can you do a video showing your Christmas products?? Thank you!! Xx
I wonder if Tanya would ever like my magic...
Does anyone know where Tanya's pyjamas are from?
Hi Tanya, I'm also an EGYPTIAN and I watch basically ALL of your videos! I'm a huge fan!💕
Finally! Best part of his Boiler Room Reykjavik set in my opinion
when the original was the best shit ever, and now this is another step above
Love that an unassuming Brit who looks like the only party he ever attended was at a chemistry frat cant stop marveling us with the most beautiful electronic music on the planet.
Video reminds me of the movie 'Momento'
WHOS GOING TO THE FORUM NEXT FRIYAAAAY!
this is absolutely AMAZING.
And on a different day no one remembers now God created Ali Michael.
Jamies style of music never ceases to amaze me. The main reason i stared to produce music of my own.
I'm so glad you released this!
Terrific.
clean fuck! yeah! perfect motorway banger! love it
He created a totally new song which is so good as the original one
I dream of a Smalltown boy remix
Man, this is wonderful.
He obliterated the song? I mean it's a good mix, on its own, but why. 😫
Blondey McCoy
We want to see more of Romy!!!
beware of the church of scientology, it is an evil cult who want to ruin your life and steal your money, your life is at risk if you involve yourself with this organisation\nwatch this film for the truth about scientology\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6oYaMtJln0&t=73s
Blondey McCoy makes an appearance, that's awesome!
17/5000\nJamie es un genio!!  Bring on the whole album please!
Reminiscent of The Mackenzie feat. Jessy - Innocence. But I don't expect Jamie to be aware of 90's Belgian dance music.
Incredible, it could be love
oh this. this is beautiful.
This was on radio 1 only way a find this song was by shazam , im glad a did
This is beautiful.
Jaime xx the best
So damn amazing
love it!!❤️
Sweet remix
el mejor!!!
Altas viagens nesse som.... Top de mais!
Fucking genius!!!
my type of music
Just when i was losing hope on modern mainstream dance music this banger pops up (Jamie XX LAD)
wow ! jamie you are so ...
when is this going to be on spotify? :'(
With the new release of their new album and their Glastonbury set this year. The XX have been the soundtrack to my summer.
You're the fucking man Jamie.
Don't mind me, just here before this explodes! 😅
I love how basically all he did was use the ambience and bass of the original and its still sick
Thank you Jamie for all the music you make it honestly makes my day 100x better! I love you Jamie, Romy, And Oliver you guys are the best!
That was fucking amazing!
I love it
Amazing!!!!!!
DOPE
furkan turanlandın
Am here before 1M views.
This is so fuckin brilliant!!!
Aaaaah ❤
Listened to this during his boiler set, truly stunning! Check it out if you haven't already
Where does it stop, where does it stop\nWhere do you dare me to (draw the line)?\nYou've got the body, you've got the body\n\nDare me to, dare me to\n\nWhere does it stop, where does it stop\nWhere do you dare me to (draw the line)?\nYou've got the body, you've got the body\nYou've got the body, you've got the body
just realised the logo for the XX is the same as the symbol for nihilism.  gj XX if it was ur intention.
The video is as good as the music
Shit sold out already??? Please make more, the world needs more of this
Can't say I thought I would see dabbing in an xx video 😅
man this is some great editing! mesmerizing to watch! would love to see the editline for this
see you soon, Xx
jamie xx makes me love life.
Heartd Jamie play this on Jamie xx Boiler Room Reykjavík DJ Set, and 2 days later they release it officially. Great!

For super thick and ultra chocolatey hot chocolate, make it in a crock pot! Sounds odd but trust me on this one and give it a try.
Usually hate travel vlogs, but loved this! U actually shared the culture and were genuinly so excited and it really came through. Now I'm dying for a fricken chocolate croissant !!! Xxx
in your food diaries you eat a lot. do you eat that much just for the video or do you always eat that much in the course of a day?
Two of my favorite things. Melanie and France :)
with Your love of style and food a video in an italian city would be perfect
Using your video for inspiration on how to decorate my Year 9 French book haha\nLOVE YOU MEL, YOU ARE SO WONDERFUL XXXXX
That cover of stromae is wonderful!
Ahhh, seeing Notre Dame and hearing Lindsey Stirling's Les Mis medley made me legitimately emotional! I really want to go to Paris now!! (also i'm hormonal and sick so that's also not helping at all) I looked for your book in Easons Cork, and I couldn't find it! Probably good because I had told myself I was only allow buy the one book!
honestly just come to turkey and have some real food 😆😆
Id love to see this video in España! 🇪🇸
The best thing I've ever eaten in my life was a pistachio creme brulee in a little cafe outside the Louvre.\nI knew exactly what face you were going to make at 9:32 when you tasted that.\nIT'S SO GOOD! SO GOOD!
just back from  a walk where i spent 10 minutes trying to get a snail off the middle of the road with a leaf so he wouldn't get crushed by a car... clicks on this vlog and sees you saying your gonna eat some 'fuckin snails' ... sigh. I wish humans would learn to have respect for other life forms on the planet, then maybe they wouldn't destroy the planet and all the living things on it as much.
I had goosebumps the whole time I was watching this!
Oh Melanie if you ever come back to my lovely city of Paris, I'd like to meet you
Oh my god are you seriousssssss ?!?!? Mellll Nutella is Italiannnnn 😳\n(Sorry I literally live where they produce it so I just freaked out a little bit) \n❤️
You definitely have to come to India. The food here is mind-blowing
Your dad is always the best part of your videos. Has he ever considered starting his own YouTube channel? :)

I was in Paris last week!!!!
What target audience  is your book geared towards . Looks beautiful there . What desserts r popular ? I say it again I love those yellow tight . I been inspired to find them here in Nashville . 💞😘
You should do a pub crawl in Ireland, and eat and drink and go through rules for tourists going to a bar (the dos and don't)!
you're the only person that's able to eat a peach and not look like a mess after 🙏🏼 love ya💗\nand nutella is italian i guess
I love that you used Lindsey Stirling in this. 😊
I feel so relaxed happy and also sad and rested but also feeling a calm restlessness. Beautiful vlog. There are many Pari vlogs, but this one is so different from those. Music helped the vlog a lot. Melanie you went up a notch with this one👌👌👌
Only 3 minutes in and this vlog is perfect
I can't wait until I get to move there 😢😢
Its been so many years since i was in paris. Would love to go back!
Paris looks gorgeous!! <3 & loved the red dress Melanie!\nIn case no one mentioned it yet, the first fruit you pointed out were prickly pears :D we get them lots in Malta!
I would love to go to Paris with you  next time 😁 And pls come to Norway and make a food vlog  😊
Your fringe looks like a lot like Amelie's when you were at the Café des 2 moulins... omg I really want to go there 😍
I got way too excited when you showed the Two Windmills. Amelie is my favorite movie.
Love all your dresses! I am so ready for that shape to come back into style cos my thighs aren't having this bodycon shit!
Such a nice video. I love France!
This gave me major Paris blues. It's my favourite place in the entire world! <3. I would love for you to do a food diary in Krakow, Poland xx
I love that Melanie says a little espresso, it's very cute. But actually that's the real size of an espresso in Italy, it's how it is supposed to be! Btw Nutella is Italian too.
I loved this and i really want to go to Paris!
Oh my god Melanie was literally talking about Dan Browns book and I was freaking out didn't know you like it Mel! I love it!! Ohh I am so excited rn😂
Aww I live in Paris, always have! You made me want to go back out there and explore with my tourist glasses on <3
My absolute favourite video of yours! The music, the filming, it was magical Melanie 💚
loving the stromae covers in this!! #toutlememe
all the french music i loveee it, also gonna go watch the hunchback of the Notre Damme now
Your outfit in this and hair remind me of Amelie !
You're so fit 😍 Wanna see you with black hair again.
Isn't it fun getting to the point where you can eat in moderation and have a good time!!!! 💘
What a great video! We got to see Paris with a Melanie voiceover. :)  Nice. BTW, the red dress looks great on you IMHO.
That was a freaking joy to watch!!! Thank you for that wonderful morning boost Melanie. I loved your editing too btw with the beautiful French music, and beautiful choices too, it was so well done!! :D xx
I just died at 13:01. You are so great xD
Have you heard the original of Tous les memes by Stromae? It's the best!!
Ethical omnivorism:):):):) yet...you have no idea where your salmon etc came from! LOVE IT !!!! You're so logical and smart Melanie!!!!!
I love this vlog ! Paris is so lovely ! I appreciate so much your good taste in french music in this video ! 😊😊😊
Currently eating a giant package of crisps...
Those weird fruit look like Tunas, we have them here in Chile, don't know if the ones in Paris are the same, but if they are, try them, they're DELICIOUS and juicy, perfect for summer!
Loved this video!!! Made me want to go to Paris so bad, especially with someone as lovely as you Mel :)
The Hunchback of Notre Dame is my ALL TIME FAVORITE Disney movie, and it is CRIMINALLY UNDERRATED!  THANK YOU for loving it too!  I'm glad you had such a fun time!
Hehehe, I joined in with your devious laugh at 6:46. You did a wonderful job putting this vlog together! The music, food, and everything else just complimented it so well. I also want to add that you looked unbelievably gorgeous in each dress. Seems like you had a great time!
Wonderful video!!!! (As always) 😊 also where are your boots from? I'm on the look out for a pair for the wintery months and your ones are perfect!
Where is that stripey red/pink and white shirt from?
Being a giant Les mis fan the music made this video so great!!! Loved it Mel, great video!!:) 😘
Noooo, Nutella is an Italian product ❤ It was created by the Ferrero family, who lives in Alba, Piedmont (northern Italy). You should definitely come and visit this beautiful city, where you can find scrumptious food as well as fine wine 😉 By the way, love your channel ❤

My body is ready.
Yup I just bought the gold edition :)
It'd been cooler had they done the actual origins of assassins, Persia
It's order a masons
Ubi, may the father of good optimization guide you, despite everything is permitted ... but we all know it is going to be a bumpy yawning ride with stutters, in the end ..meh
My god the music in the end😭😍
I'm going to get 300 dislikes for this, but uh... no Switch port?
In 0:34 was that reference to a spilting of a sea????
KKK Vamos ver se dessa vez nao tem bugs
Im fucking ready.
Idea fot the next game. The Assasin is an gladiator in rome(hes still not an assasin). He doubts he can ever ecape from slavery, so he accepts his fate. Somehow he manages to escape with the help of spartacus, and after spartacus dies, he retreats somewhere near rome. Then, he finds out that the romans and the emperor are templars or something like that.Yeah not the best story, because i made it, but it would be awesome to be something like that in the next game. Like so ubi can see, and if u like it :) btw ubi can make the motivation of ur character becoming an assasin and such on
They are the Sons of the Harpy.
1.Please don't downgrade graphics\n2.Please have everything from demo in full version\n3.Pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee don't delay release date
Can we please get those masks in a *Limited Edition* set 😍
The first thing I will do is ramming the enemy with camel
This is relating to present for fight against aliens
There's something i haven't seen anywhere and its that back in a previous AC title, i think involving ezio, there's a statue for an assassin who killed cleopatra with a snake. So how is the creed working with her
0:41 till end: i know older people overstate with the description of there way to school (barefood through snow etc.) but by the egyptian it becomes unbelievable... :D
The order must be the early templers
Assassin's Creed should have a more Uncharted 4/God of War 4/Prince of Persia feel rather than a Witcher 3/arcade game feel. The trailers always have that feel but not the game. It'd be cool if the combat was like Assassin's Creed Syndicate but a flowed a little better like in Batman Arkham because the riggedness and repetitiveness of the fighting got a bit tedious in Syndicate at times. The animations seem blocky at times.
By the order of the Ancients.\n- Dragon Knight, Dota 2
This trailer is awesome i can't wait.
Wow! It's beautiful!
Here is how I feel...\nI have a PS4.\nEvery footage we've seen so far on Assassin's Creed Origins runs on XBOX One X. Now, I am not trying to criticize Xbox One X or the game itself and it's performance on XBX, rather it's one of the most gorgeous looking games so far and I love everything about ACO. So what is my problem? It's the fact that we will be seeing a different game, a downgraded game, when played on PS4 and Xbox One S. Those two consoles can't handle this game, in my opinion, even at 1080p with descent graphics and playable frame-rate (based on other game releases such as Final Fantasy XV or The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt). To try and make it look good means they would have to compromise the frame-rate or in order to play in a (I consider smooth) 30fps, we would get really bad graphics. I fear that ACO for (especially) PS4 would be the same case with Unity or Syndicate. Unity looked beautiful but lacked frame-rate and performance and Syndicate was smoother but lacked the eye appeal that Unity granted. So basically what I'm saying is that the only choice you have on enjoying this title is to play it on PS4 PRO or Scorpio (consoles). Anything besides that, for this game and every other game to come, PS4 and XBS is a downgrade, and Sony and Microsoft aren't saying a thing about this issue because, I know, they do have better options. Pro (Sony), Scorpio (Microsoft), and now it's only up to the player if he/or she wants the better experience in the end, but of course, it'll cost you.
So bayek is working for Cleópatra ? My theory is that Cleópatra is gonna be Crazy for power
0:58 why are they running to the fire?
Getting me THIS CLOSE to canceling my pre-order for Shadow of War for this. I can only afford one and I own all the rest of the AC games.
Filthy Goa'ulds! Where is SG1, when you need them?
That Vivendi forces in the trailer? If you do not buy more stocks, your company will burn to the ground...
Hello Mr Ashraf Ismail ,My name is Lee Yoon Hang from Malaysia and 18 years old call me Jackson Lee. thank you out of the assassin creed origin,I am assassin's creed supporters and National Historian.  I hope you through the video games with mission. You promised me, you make the game is replay mission and replay side missions in sequence just like Assassin's Creed 3, Liberation, Black Flag, Rogue, Unity, Chronicles and Syndicate. You are lot less game thing is in the single mission is Explore the area Identify opportunities : (1. Stealth Opportunity 2. Assistance Opportunity 3. Unique Kill Opportunity) by Assassins Creed Unity and Syndicate. Challenge in Single Mission and Side Mission, DLC Mission and Side Mission, Back to Old Kingdom Egypt mission just like World War 1 by Assassin's Creed Syndicate and Don't forget the Important Character is Mark Antony Rome politician and general in Egypt. But Mr Ashraf Ismail I have a question ? A Chinese Warrior Character is come from the Han Dynasty (BC 202~220),Han Dynasty clothing is correct but why his hairstyle looks just like The Qing dynasty (1636~1912)? How do you explain the game director! Very so funny man. I'm National Historian of student. Thank you for the Egypt world I'm very so happy and I'm your Supporters.
SO Hype for this game !
Maybe their 4 primary leaders would be -- War, Famine, Pestilence and Death -- now that would be awesome.
4K Native Only On Xbox Console
Mais uma vez a Ubisoft capricho no assassina Creed
Pretty sure Ubisoft wants you to know that the templars are the Ancient Ones :)
The Order of Ubisoft.\nMysterious figures, who seek the money of the ancient scrubs.\nHidden and faceless, they control the final content from the shadows. From downgrades to overpriced DLC's, their hunger for money and control is limitless.\nWhen Ubisoft craves for money, noone can stand in their way.\nTHEY ARE THE REASON FOR YOUR PAIN AND ANGER!\nIF YOU DO NOT ACT, THE GAMING-INDUSTRY WILL BURN TO THE GROUND!\n\n\n\nUbisoft will tear your wallet apart.\nWhat will you do, Casual?\n__________________________\n\nAnother AC Game, available October 27th.\nPre-order now and get a game, that isn't missing a mission, but we still add expensive DLC's with missions so you can enjoy the full game later for double the price.
So these are like the egyptian Templars
This music reminds me something but I do not know where I heard it, maybe in a previous AC trailer ?
Awesome game can't wait!!! They should do one in Rome next!!! Or Korea
Do not worry guys. This trailer may seem like it is trying to make the Order of the Ancients creepy and dark, but the Order of the Ancients may not be as dark and creepy as you think they are. It is just like the movie trailer Mother looking like a horror movie when it turned out that Mother was not really a horror after all. Anyway, I am getting hyped for this game to come out.
ubisoft and there games are great i hope they bring back the style of venturing further the majestic feel hidden treasure ,experimental combats and great story line.
looks good but so did unity, I'll wait  before I spend my $
lemme guess, another 60$ for single player game! neat
00:46 the theme is fuckin epic !!!
i hope brutus is in this game, the one who responsible for caesar's death
Lord Chin Chin is not pleased
Man I want this game so bad. Haven't been this excited about a game since news of rdr2. I hope it has a great story.
For me personally, it's a theme I would like to see explored more.\nso it's his Uplay Key GLOBAL:  https://www.g2a.com/assassins-creed-origins-uplay-key-global-i10000068314001?reflink=asc-key-global
Magi\nThe Mummy throwback?\nha, nice.
This sent chills down my spine O.o
I'm never sure what to expect out of this franchise anymore.  I am glad that they took two years to make this one, and I did generally like Syndicate.
far cry primal vibes
You guys need to have a free demo for Xbox and ps4 that way we can all get a glimpse of the game and buy it when it comes out
plisss 2018 build assasin in palestina plissss plisss
woooow it's so amazing
This trailer is really sick, what's the soundtrack name btw?\nI hope there is the possibiliy to loot their masks when you kill them, because I want to go around with that Anubis mask equipped for the entire game
WOW THE GAME LOOK LIT BTW IGNORE THE FKNN HATER
I'm excited!!
Do yourself a favour;\n1. Pause the trailer and mute the sound \n2. Open a new tab \n3 Search 'Trinity' by James Dooley\n4. Play the song along with the trailer\nYou can thank me later ;)\n\n(That rhymed lol)
Please put multiplayer in it, its the most fun part of AC!
awesome....
looks cool. but the next one better take place in japan
October 27th is so close yet so far away
Going back means no guns, no cannons... \nBack to bow and dart I guess....
Assassin's Creed Original fantastico
Bugisoft
Mummy?
YOU KNOW WHAT WAS GOOD ABOUT ASSASSINS CREED?  MY BOI CONNER KENWAY GAHAHA! FUK YEAS
cool
Pleaaaaaseeee be an awesome story
1:13 bayek can grow beard confirmed
Actual Ingame Footage
Can not bloody wait!!!!!
WE
i wqtching in 5 k 1080 p
1:28 Legolas?
super a ssassins kiedy premiera
but the world is supposed to end September 23rd..
I don't know why but, Assasin's Creed's graphics never looked like in sinematic trailer (You can compare)
Am I the only one thinking who is this assassin and who in the hell trained him to be so good and unique
I don't think they are templars I think they're linked to the first civilisation
Ohhhhhhh! Are they gonna say the Plagues of Egypt were all caused by pieces of Eden? That's a really cool idea.
0:58 is the best. The stuck NPC running in a fire. I also love the ULTRA-LOW polygons all around.
So you create an organization to fight them and make a really really really stupid creed.  This should be a reboot and change that stupid creed.  Everything is permitted, remember?  How stupid.
WE
Maybe some armors/outfits with the greek/egyptian/roman style would be nice to see. And take your time to make this game great, dont sell us the name ... sell us a game that will love. And reconsider that dodge, too long!
The Arabs destroyed my Egypt... They r the reason of my pain and anger
THIS COUNTRY ?! come on Ubisoft... \nthe notion of country didn't even exist yet back in ancient Egypt era. There were only empires and unexplored lands.\nshould we take this as a bad sign for poor research work and possible more and bigger historical inaccuracies within the game?
If you are stupid, please pre order.
Is this like the majjii from the old mummy movies?
The 10 plagues will be appear in the game?
I'm guessing the anubis guy is the Grand Master Templar
Please refine the parkour system Ubisoft!!! Bayak has no flair with his free running it's going to be very boring to run around as him unlike it was with Arno!!! He needs his own flair, but you guys have not done enough to give him that flair!! I'm seriously doubting players will want to play the game very much if they can't traverse the world with creative flair and you guys have a month left please please please make it count and add this one detail!!
How can a group call themselves the order of the ancients? We, in the present day can refer to ancient times but an ancient order calling themselves ancient doesn't make much sense.
In this AC you are supposed to be first Assassin ever? Weren't there like even older ones from Babylon or somewhere from Middle East?
Dude, this looks like it's gonna have one hell of a story compared to the last few AC's. I hope it does well. If it gets a 7/10 or higher by steam I'll consider getting it. I haven't seen one worthy since Black Flag
SO the mejai are both defender against the evil mummy and origin of the assassins. LOLOLOLOL
please remove the slow mo and zoomed arrow thingy
Remove that fuking centurion
I'm on the fence. Not a fan of the series and its mechanics, but Origins seems to have taken notes from the right games. Did Ubisoft finally get rid of abstergo's modern day side story, or is it in this game?
*The Floor is Lava* \nComing to a theater near u

is there a headphone jack
Gotta love new iphone! I even created a music video rapping about it yo
why do we need a new version of an Iphone? Did the landfills get lonely? Did the minerals in Africa overflow and demand to be mined while their local governement decided to exploit them while the people starved.
There's no touchID, the design is ugly, it has no headphone jack, the new camera mode is useless, it's too thin, and it doesn't even look like an iPhone. Sorry apple, you tried, and you failed.
so only face id? how tf are they gonna unlock it during night time when in bed?
who else thinks removing the home button is a big mistake
They off nothing of interest to me. All stolen ideas from Android. I'll take my LeEco Pro 3.
I Phone 10 Reasoning  First x-Face ID Phone
nothing but a Samsung with a apple!.  Hasnt been the same since Steve!  The phone passed with him!
alright guys, no phone on Halloween.

iPhone 11: Removed camera and introducing iCam, only $500
Super low brigntness
OMG
So now when you get arrested, cops can now unlock your phone by pointing it at your face while you are in handcuffs, thanks Apple.
Haha he still said it unlocked when it didnt
The first smartphone, IBM Simon Personal Communicator, came out in 1994. A wild touchable screen, no keypad, and multiple capabilities in one are the unique selling point of Simon. However, most of the people get the concept of smartphone was when the first iPhone came out. Due to its slogan “Apple reinvents the phone”, the first generation iPhone is a revolutionary device, people can listen music, play video games, browsing internet with it. Everything with a simple touch is what iPhone can bring people, and iPhone is just an example of the smartphone. People are getting more comfort through this new technology, because now instead of walk to a desktop and do all those complicated steps, they can just type the small screen, then they just send an email through their smartphone. People can use their smartphone to control the temperature of the room, or put some camera in their house, and by connecting to their smartphone, now they can see through their smartphone if any stranger went in their house while they are out for working or playing. \nThrough all those advantages and comfort that from the first generation to the latest smartphone, there are also are disadvantages, and the biggest disadvantage is the smartphone actually cannot compete itself to those specific functional device, such as the graphic of smartphone’s videogame is just not as good as the graphic of X-box or PlayStation and the most famous videogame will only appear on them or a PC, Most of the smartphone’s GPU is also part of its CPU such as Apple’s A10 chip, the concept of its GPU is like the integrated graphics card on PC which is just not a competition to the dedicated graphics card which is the most gamer are using. Due to its lower quality graphics card, most of its games selling point is not the graphic part, but it is the virtual items, which is the more money you put in this game, the more powerful you going to be in the game which just separate its original purpose as a game.   \nThe quality of the camera on smartphones is also not as good as those single-lens reflex cameras. Most of the smartphones’ camera have average 10 megapixels, but a SLR camera have a at least 15 megapixels, and some of them can do more than 100 megapixels, also the SLR camera can add extended lenses which are capable to do more things than a smartphone’s camera, moreover a professional photographer will not use a smartphone to capture an important moment, and also those world famous photographer just prefers a camera, a real camera, for their profession. \nIn school, a calculator (no matter it capable to graph or not) is a necessary tool to use, and the teacher probably would not want to see the student pulls a smartphone out in the class no matter the student is trying to calculate with the smartphone or doing something else, neither the parents wants to see their kids have a smartphone out while they are doing their homework. The problem in this is no matter if they are using as a calculator or as something else, people will still affect by their subconscious such as when you pull out your smartphone during a test, then the teach will think you are looking answer on the internet. Another simple example is smartphone must be turned off during the test (ACT, SAT, GED, etc.), a smartphone without power is less value than a brick. So the issues are not only just technological, there is also the society problem which is the smartphone cannot bring people trust due to its multiple in one features which is you can do something else besides use it to calculate numbers which it can also reflect the trust issue between human. If people trust each other, then smartphone would be totally okay to use on those biggest exams in the world, but essentially not.\nSmartphones can make people’s life easier, and it also let us live in a comfort life, but is this the comfort that people want, does the people approves this “unfinished device” which it does everything, but not the best of everything. People may say that the technology is just not there yet, just compare the different between the first generation smartphone and the latest smartphone, it is getting better. The problem is those bigger devices are also getting better or evolving, this could be a loop which is the smartphone is always one step behind. People may start thinking smartphone is just small mobile device, you cannot compare them, size matters. Either those two professional gaming device or a PC is way bigger than a pocket size iPhone, but if the purpose is to making people live more comfort, than why it is not the best? Does not the best give people the most comfort? Is this smartphone really the result of people trying to live in a comfort life, or it is the result of the laziness of people because it simplifies all those functions, and we all know that the simple version is not as good as the full version.
Seriously I don't want a phone hitting my face with 30k dots.... what a lost crowd of tool zombies. It's so prettt... reminds me of the South Park series where the smug cloud of Prius cars perfect example of a bunch of idiots
None of these are new features. A new feature would help you take a dump when you really need it.
The Iphone X : The Porsche 918 of phones.
Whoop Dee Doo...'Innovating features and technology that's already been implemented on other phones by other companies by at least a couple years, way to catch up Apple, bravo.!
...an IPhone 4 is better than this, what the hell?
You are creating what Samsung already made . lol
Its so elegant
All for the design but who the heck thought putting the earpiece basically over the display would be a good idea have fun watching Netflix
They took out the headphone jack and now they took out the home button
It still doesn't address listening to music and charging at the same time problem and I wouldn't want apple to have a scan of my face, first finger prints now scans of your face this is taking the piss and going to far
It's better than I thought it would be
So pretty much if my bf is sleeping
iPhone just can't keep up with Galaxy
jus wait the iPhone come up saying sorry we missed counted it Iphone 9 not X
welcome to the year 2015 the galaxy s6 has the same specs
Still no regular ear phone input 0:37
We are witnessing the last phone apple will ever release, $1000 starting for a phone? Only a tard would spend that.
Iphone copied Amazon fire phone on the slide up features and cameras. And also copied Samsung on Camera features. Iphone is still behind.
At 1:37 * looks at phone with eyes closed so it doesnt unlock *\n1:40 * eyes still closed and it unlocks * - magic!!
*Glass Back:* gonna break in less than a week\n\n*No Home Button:* so im supposed to remember all the swiping motions like\n\n*Dual Camera with Modes:* but what if I want to take...like...a normal picture\n\n*Face Unlock:* some random garlic bread looking dude bout to steal it, put it all up in my face and look at all my stuff no thanks\n\n*Apple Pay:* that same garlic bread looking man gonna max my card too\n\n*Price:* i could go to cracker barrel and get fat off the whole menu for less than this\n\nno earbud jack\n\nearbuds probably gonna be starting at $150\n\nis there even a charger jack\n\ntf paying another $300 just to get some juice in my own phone\n\npass
i HATE the design on the top of the phone. Stupid! Buying a LG V30 instead!
I don't care what anybody says I'm not spending $1000 on a phone that doesn't even have a headphone jack.
iPhone 7: no earphones\niPhone X: no home button,\nyeah, we can all agree that the next apple phone product is gonna be super complicated.
The first thing I thought was why does apple keep making new iPhones? Now I have to get another one?
Just found an android app that lets you put the iphone x notch on any android phone. And trust me it looks as ugly as the real deal. It just might save you $1000. 👍
$1000? This phone better be taking me on holiday when i turn it on airplane mode smh
I like it, but if I had one, I would be nervous about cracking the screen.
I'm sorry to say but I don't like it because why would you take off the fingerprint ID and get rid of the home button and the black like the home buttona And I really liked the fingerprint ID because it was really easy to get on your phone and the new Sangsung 9 still has the fingerprint ID so please think about it I'm very sorry but have a nice day.
Hasn't samsung been had face unlock? This just looks like an samsung s8
Jesus already we've got the iPhone 10
All I know is I'm switching to Samsung
He could have said 1 Terabyte instead of 1,000 Gigabytes
How would you unlock it in the dark?
The iPhone X no headphone jack no home button iPhone X the future is now
One question? \n\n\n\n\nDoes it have a headphone jack
Its just a phone, why is it expensive?
Why are recent iPhone designs look like Samsung Galaxy phones?
I have an I phone 7 I want this one now
You guys will never give an honest review on the iPhone x so not to lose your early access of Apple devices.
More like IPhone XD get it because of XD.......... it’s a bad joke
Purchasing the X or even the 8 for that matter is telling Apple that it is OK to continue to outsource labor and push over priced electronics on consumers. Apple continues to manufacture their products overseas, which should reduce the cost of their products yet the prices are higher than ever. Their methodical slow release of tech ensures that consumers continue to purchase devices, expend our our natural resources, pollute our environment sending phones to the landfill sooner than necessary. When did we become such a wasteful society? Ask yourself if you want to continue supporting a pretentious brand who is bent on emptying your pockets while destroying the environment. There is a lot to be said about Apple and not sure much of it is good.
If it didnt have that camera in the front that COMPLETELY messes up the straight line, i would Love It. Why didnt they just make it a straight line so i could be calm?
Why would you buy this apple crap get Samsung galaxy s8+ its way  better
It's kool if u want to show u got cash 💰🔥 to burn but besides that I. Good
I've never been interested in an iPhone until now
Expensive. Just wait couple month.. lenovo will make it
I'm gonna point it at this gentleman's face, because that's his face. That's the best
What about sunglasses? Can't get in your phone then?
The X stands for Xpensive
I'll laugh at anyone I see have this phone. Suck a waste of money, and it's fricken over $1000! rip off.
How hard was it to keep a on screen home button?
Good job Patel and thanks so much for showing the size comparison between iPhone 10 and 7 plus. Now I've decided to buy iPhone 10. Thought iPhone 10 will be bigger phone than iPhone plus. No one showed the size comparison except Verge. \nThanks again.
Let's take it one step further! I want to 3D scan objects with the face ID camera system and print a copy on my 3D printer!
K
Get a Samsung
Sees IPhone X *FACEPALM*
Why iphone design always copy samsung phone?

RIP Sir!

love you HDS
Jim Carrey is right. And these bozos are pawns of the system.
No he's basically saying that you stupid little jobs, that's have you pressing on about  fame and all things hollow are totally irrelevant in the garden scale of things. Wankers.
Jim is sooo woke. EGO IS EVIL. These people are twats
Flatlanders from the Truman Show commenting with fuck me accents. Lovely!
Woke beyond woke. I love him. Fuck these puppets....
This is so fucked that he just gets passed off like that. I hope this generation sees it for what it is
Just let Jim 🐝 he happens to be 💯 percent correct
this answer interview is older than the bizarre interview
he's lying. he's trying to hide the signs...chester bennington tried too and look what happened.
Wow media again trying to control how we feel and think...
What he said makes perfect sense to me.
he really is God
Best movies of all time: truman show and eternal sunshine
Yeah I mean, the concept is 'Anatta'. It can be a useful concept but...It's strong medicine that my sense is you kind of have to build up to...
Love him. Calling out the stupidity of it all.
Its so irritating to watch these interviewers react with sarcasm about the first real conversations I've heard in interviews in the last decade. The only topics for discussion nowadays are Kardashians ass implants and Trumps wig. Don't talk about consciousness! Don't talk about growth!... Just ass and wigs.
this stupid reporters should show some respect for a man who is that big !!!
Who are these boobs? Mr. Carey has reached a higher state of consciousness and they are speaking as if he's lost his mind.
Everybody knows that you can lose a some of your self identity if you have been an actor as long as Jim Carry has. The price for fame. Jim is a pretty interesting personality.
Imagine the money in apocalyptic world
U don't need a red pill to stop being third eye blind. Just a fierce desire to think for yourself & not what u r told! 👌🏼🤔
Carrey was on point...media playing their subversion carelessly.
this is so disgusting how these people are being. obviously he's dealing with depression and identity crisis and WHO WOULDN'T when you became a celebrity at the time he did, when celebrities had to be perfect and be the character they portrayed all the time. but most of all, let's remember the fact that this lady's first words to him are asking about needing a date after his girlfriend just committed suicide. i dont think all these icons would seem like they mattered much to you either if your girlfriend just killed herself and you're dealing with severe depression. it's disgusting. leave him alone.
Fuck the media and the news
Jim is next to die them Juden will kill him like everybody else that opens up on them
These media people are to into there jobs that they are tools of the trade
There people are trying to make him look insane when he's actually more sane and aware than any of them.
A bunch of ignorant self-centered reporters with small minded perspectives which is the problem and what Carrey is getting at. They only help him by appearing so ignorant but you have to feel sorry for them.
It annoys me how just because there talking about a comedian there demeanor is like everything is funny. That must be so frustrating to assume the role as comedian and never be take seriously.
He simply managed to walk out of the matrix we are living in. Meditation and ask your self what really matters. Don't try to fins answers on the internet, just ask your self true questions and you will begin to understand Jim.
Jim Carrey is so over their heads it's too funny yet hey Jim if you can't stand the social programming matrix construct you are awakened to~~~~ why fucking bother showing up to such an event? \n1. Jim gets paid big bucks to do it hence yes he is aware but shows up to social media events to play the new age looney tune to many (HENCE CORPORATE MEDIA TALKS ABOUT) AND THE FEW IN THE KNOW OF THE CHESS GAME MATRIX LAUGH THEIR ASS OFF YET GAINS FEW TO DELVE DEEPER IN WHAT HE'S ACTUALLY SAYING.\n2. Jim Carrey Actually tries within his field to wake others up & uses Corporate Media in Earnest! HMMM......?\n3. Take Jim Carrey with a Grain of Salt in Holly Weird~ IF HE TRULY HAS DISCERNMENT WANTING TO PIERCE THE MATRIX VEIL HE WOULD HAVE LEFT HOLLY WEIRD ALONG TIME AGO~ HENCE A PUPPET PROPAGANDA SIDE SHOW TO DISCREDIT THOSE WHO ARE IN THE KNOW OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAMMING! HE LIKES HIS $$$$ LIFE STYLE TOO MUCH TO GIVE UP TO BE A COMMON HUMAN BEING W/ GRACE & DISCERNING VULNERABILITY....OF SELF LOVE.....BEYOND THE MATRIX..... \n4. FOR ALL WE KNOW HE IS JUST A WEBOT PROGRAM FOR YOUR ENTERTAINMENT TO DECEIVE AND LAUGH AT THE DECEPTION....
Jim isn't talking nonsense. The idea is that the self is an illusion. We cling to a false sense of identity based on where we were born, who we're told we're supposed to be and how we're supposed to behave. I believe he has studied the principles of Non Duality, which if anyone is interested in, look up Jeff Foster and Eckhart Tolle, who give wonderful explanations on the subject. Of course, taken out of context, it sounds like he's going insane, but if you actually pay attention to what he's saying, it all makes sense.
do these people know what he does for a living? why are people so surprise at his remarks.
Fucked up reporters are stupid and shallow as de pit beneath their feet
He figured out that the earth is flat, and he is inside a enclosed dome like, structure, similar to the truman show. I'M SERIOUS!
Reporters were too stupid to comment on his what Jim said....
Making fun of something you all can not understand doesn't make you  look good. Just a bit of advice.
They don't get it at all - but have their close ones die, have them lose their jobs, have them spend some time alone and they will soon realise their entire 'identity' was built upon a façade that they never knew existed until they were put in that position, because they have never had to 'look inside' themselves for anything. This is why unemployed people become depressed, this is why when wives cheat on husbands the husbands go off the rail. This is why people who get bullied kill themselves. And this is what is meant by putting 'God first' Not your mum, your dad, your boss, your job, your wife or husband, or purpose - Those things are not a reliable anchor point for anyone and when we attatch our identities to them and they no longer serve us we have nothing to cling on to. Jim is a great example of putting 'god' first - He isn't falling for the trap that he is an idol - like the people treat him as and he has even said once people get all that external stuff they will realise that it does not make you happy. I've been there, Im sure a lot of others have as well and its a weired place to be in especially when you have to deal with idiot people like these reporters who will never understand you
Dissappointing these anchors are making fun of a man who is AWARE of his conscious subconscious mind and self. To a person that cannot grasp that differentiation....he would appear odd. Good for Jim Carey. He is beginning to see that he doesnt have to be a label. That he is much more than that. \n\n-Lorelei
All I see is Jim Carrey calling out bullshit on Hollywood and a bunch of dumb ass reporters not being able to accept that they might be part of the meaninglessness \n#Carreyforpresident
Fashion is an industry and a culture of its own. To dismiss it as trivial is as ludicrous as dismissing comedy or acting or television. A lot of fan boys in the comments, but it's clear to see that Carey is losing the plot. Hopefully he is getting some help.
GO FOR iT JiM!!!❤ you ve got it!
I got every single word he said on this latest explanation.. On the otherside got really scared with the first interview I saw.. More relaxed now, he is not nuts..
there Is much more people supporting you jim 💪💪
It's obvious that Jim is searching for something. The arrogance of these reporters is sickening. So condescending as if they have all the answers. Like they have life all figured out.
I think Jim Carrey is seeing the world like Neo does at the end of the Matrix. He's a fucking genius
Why so serious? He's a comedian ffs.
Right on. We are all one energy, expressed as consciousness.But all they cared about was how he looked.
Jim Carrey is a fucking genius, he is truly enlightened. those reported were the fattest nitwits i have ever seen. They totally missed his message it went straight over their heads like they were children.
These Orange fashion people are like... wat R spirit? is it in? is it sexy? FUCK YOU1!?12 KL3EFKLW QHAFASDJKLHFVOIASDHFKL;ASDHFA
Lol at the fact that idiots see a drug fueled narcissist spout half-baked pseduo-intellectual shite and they call it genius and WOKE.
These guys didn't get it.
Look at this asshole talking questioning society and existence! Thinks he's too good for the twelth award show this week does he?! I bet he doesn't even know the current top ten lists of celebrity gossip!
Lol, feeble minded media. We don't understand what he's saying so we'll just ridicule and belittle it
Jim Carrey gets it. These reporters are idiots.
He's trying to describe the Zen worldview, which, admittedly, is difficult. 'Zen is not words'.
Why in the fuck does anyone even watch these TV shows anymore? Who gives a fuck what they think or have to say?????
I don't think they're so wrong. Jim sounds like he just had his first acid trip. In all that infinite wisdom you'd think there'd be something about not fucking up tv shows. Whoa, let's blow some minds at fashion week! edgy stuff jim.
'Was he Truman show?' Lol what a retard
I understand exactly what he's saying....
I want this god of a man to give me anal
he doesn't exist without a role to play\n\nyou took his message of there is no self, only consciousness, individuality is a misconception and we are all actors on the stage of life and turned it into poor guy will go crazy if he doesn't get some work soon.
You idiot reporters will always try to suppress a higher form of consciousness. Guess what dicks, the gig is up! Stick that in your pipe and smoke it!
That shit went right over there head lmfao no body really ever looks at the big picture only the small portion there subjected to
And what was weird about that... I'm being serious, sounded pretty norm to me.
When people can't understand something they mock it. Jim's a genius, you can't expect these people to get where he's coming from, they still have their blinders on 🙈
His interview at Fashion Week plus his response illustrates he's been doing some seriously deep, introspective thinking.  I'd love a book list of what he's been reading.
He has hillbilly bipolar skistifenia he is sick in his mind from this disease
Respect, understanding and knowledge. well said.
He knows more than these shitty, non-introspective, fuck-all news heads talking about things they know nothing about. I feel bad for them and how fast that went over their heads.
Everyones comments are sooo refreshing!!! Stopped watching tv a long time ago because it's filled with this BS! Its good to see humankind standing up for truth and a saner reality 👍👍👍
I am on board with Jim Carry on this one. But wtf is going on with Jim Carry why the fuck is he all weird and trying to be a prophet lately? Stop being fucking weird Jim Carry. And I don't mean the funny weird. You're just weird now.
the only reporter of the bunch who actually was thinking about what he said was the Blonde girl... The other two dipshits can keep drinking the kool-aid. STAY WOKE FAM!
how is it possible for these reporters to be this stupid
Mass media employees are literally dumber than a box of rocks. Admit that you make a cushy living by manipulating and exploiting tax payers, and change your fucking tune.\n\nEducate yourself. Become articulate -- able to think, form arguments, act and lead. Transcend your ignorance and victimhood. Reduce the suffering in the world. Lead a heroic life.
Of course these clowns will not take this seriously and laugh it off.
Even Will Ferrell's Anchorman would analize this in a better, more professional and deeper view. These people is why tv is finally going to an end. We're done with this s***
Jim Carrey is Black Pilled af. The man is living on a whole other plane of existence. Many of us cannot simply comprehend what he is thinking, what he feels, and how he sees the world, and frankly I think there's a sublime beauty to that.
I wanna see the whole interview. He probably went on about more truth you dumb mfs don't wanna realize. I was honestly surprised he dropped it so bluntly like that. people aren't ready for it like that. I appreciate him for this though, it makes me happy af to know he's waking people up.
I really want to give that fat prick a smack.
He has gone insane.
Enlightened.
HE'S WOKE
God Loves you Jim Carrey.
Wise fucker
normies
Lol more thumbs down
Yo fuck these shit shallow reporters!
GIga niggers
consciousness an shapes
RETARDS.. FUCKING RETARDS EVERYWHERE
They mock him instead of trying to understand his view. Fucking retards.
Pray this man gets saved, what a sad thing.
It's the whole point to make woke and clever people look mental incase they cause others to wake
Once in awhile you'll get these actors who all the sudden become very deep and think they've found the meaning of everyone's life blah blah blah and they sound schizo at first but they're just trying to sound way too spiritual lol
Jim's in crisis because his wife died... Obviously he's going to act out. It doesn't mean he's suddenly woke or some nonsense, it means he's fucking grieving, you twats... He doesn't have the drive to make people laugh or to vent his emotions since he isn't acting or in movies anymore (previously, those were his vices). He's depressed and he's going through the stages of grief (denial [done], anger [done], bargaining [done], depression [in progress] and acceptance [he will get there soon)... So everybody stop taking everything he says so seriously (or literally). He's not on some higher level of consciousness or whatever the fuck you hippies want to call it, he's fucking depressed. That's why he's trying to destroy his image, that's why he didn't give a fuck during the fashion week interview, or any other fucking interview since she died. Leave him alone and stop promoting this self destructive behaviour, it's not helping him, he just needs time.
When ur having a mid life crsis so u accidentally fall into and promote a predatory bastardisation of 'new age' ideas that preys on the mentally ill and otherwise vulnerable through con men like David Wolfe.\n\nOh well done, Jim... most people go through this phase aged 14 or so...
He's a nihilist so who cares. You didn't have to talk to him.
I don't know why so many people support this idea of his. Anything above procreation is essentially pointless. But these things exist to bring joy and happiness to those that enjoy them, much like movies, music, good food, video games etc... \n\nAnyone who claims a higher understanding and that these things are beneath them is lost in the sauce imo.
Jim Carrey is crazy
I hope one day people will stans talent rather than popularity.
I love honestly love Bobby and his music.. Everything he has put out always hit something in me. Hype Bobby or slow jam Bobby I love everything. As an Artist and rapper you can tell he's grown heaps. Love this old school Hip Hop vibe, you don't see this much this days in music. I know the boys will be at the back supporting him and especially Hanbin.. \nKeep it up Bobby, stay true and stay humble.
Runaway issa bop
During a stressful and dejected time of my life, this song really voices how I feel. Thank you Bobby.
bobby created a master piece ❤❤❤
This is the best song I ever heard
the song is really pleasant I love the rap in it very much and bobby is so handsome and charming as well as his voice and his gaze is killing me 😍😍😍😍😍😍
I thought his music video was gonna be more hip hop and upbeat like MOBB but this is good too. Definitely something new worth listening to coming from Bobby.
bobby i love this song.. ❤❤❤
I LOVE U FOREVER
Is Bobby a Christian? I love the vocals by the way ugh
I was literally blown away by this song. When I opened it I did not know it would be this amazing. It speaks out. And it stands out. Bobby is way too charismatic.
HE PUT A BIBLE VERSE IN THE MV MA BOI IS SUCH A LEGEND HE'S SO GOOD
Your voice is very very very great., bobby
I really love this song omg
I love this song  and bobby cute
that voice!!!!! i just can´t stop listen
He looks so good!
This just makes me want to hold his hand or hug him. Damn i felt the emotion directly and it was so sadly relatable
I love his voice so much!!!!!
It took days for 1M views, what a reupload mishap.\nAnyway,  this song deserves a lot!💕
Exo-L here but this is song 😢 bobby fighting 😊❤

Still streaming this song, because I think its beautiful with such meaningful feelings. The sound and his voice go well perfectly. So proud of you Bobby, for your hard work, not only working on the songs but for also pushing to get them heard and finally being able to put together your first solo album. Big Congratulations. Love from U.S!  FIGHTING! Always cheering for you and your beloved iKON members!

love that bible verse❤ bobby is so beautiful, this song is beautiful
omg I was not a huge bobby fan before but this song is soo good! I wish people could actually understand this T.T
Please support Bobby by buying his album. It'll be a bit disappointing if this album doesn't do well.
He has such a unique singing voice. I love it
I want to run away from reality. I failed my test.
I love the contrast between the two MV's, well done Bobby

When the comments are all about how good the song is... so proud of Bobby! ^_^
I don't know whether it is right to say this but i think i have throw away the greed for higher views for this mv and now i can enjoy this song happily w/o any burden. Just like old time where views are not the necessary measure. Its just the song that only  matter. Really appreciate this masterpiece and of course all the songs in the album is gold.

I'm 100% European and .1% Asian/Native American. So I'm more than a person.
CONFIRMED! Emma's moving to Sweden! :D
Im to scared to do this shit cause I have alot if health issues in my family and im like extremely mixed.
You don't become intolerant to dairy, we are always intolerant to dairy, it overwhelms our system.. our system just copes with the crap being in us. When you clean out the system it resent and if you have dairy after a long time the reaction your body has is the response it was always meant to have when given a toxin.. but sadly because dairy is in almost all infant formula and goes through breastmilk we come into contact with the crap from an early age and unable to tell the adults that shit hurts as..
The average british white person is about 37% anglo saxon, 22% celtic, 20% french and german, 10% scandinavian, 3% iberian and 2% italian and greek.
At the end when you said I am never gonna die, I thought you were going to add something like unless I get hit by a car.
Emma you are honestly my favourite YouTuber you're funny and beautiful and just amazing I wish I actually knew you in real life because I think think you're just awesome you're videos always cheer me up and make me laugh just thank you for being you 😊
Subscribed for a very very very very very very long time young immortal woman
EMMA I JUST HAD A THOUGHT (sorry, thoughts don't happen that often XD) I reckon it'd sound great if you did a cover of The Chain, by Fleetwood Mac ^_^
Thought would be mainly Romanian.
Watch out for buses.
this was a rly funny vid emma good job
The thing about lactose/dairy... is that we SHOULD be intolerant to it. We humans are the only ones who consume dairy products in our adult life. Other milk-drinking-species, stop when they're out of infancy. \n\nSo Emma, you're lactose intolerance isn't weird :p
And there I was thinking you're DNA results were going to reveal you was EPICALLY AWESOME, joke. You already are.
U can turn yr eyes like pennywise
Hey, i just wanted you to know that when i watch your videos i get a sense of calm that i get from nobody else. I am bipolar and only discovered this recently but your humour is something i connect with on even the most basic levels and it has helped me overcome the drastic changes my life has taken since then. You are an awesome person Emma please keep doing what you're doing because even when you feel like you're doing shit you're still bringing joy to one up and down mess of a person and i cant thank you enough for that.
Hey congrats on being officially a singer it was written in the metro that you were a singer who just happens to do youtube stuff on the side, and if you're feeling anything about the dna results, watchdog did a test on a dog dna company and well anything including the presenters were matched as being dogs and very specific breeds of dogs at that, so if you want to do one of those you'd get matched to be a dog, I wouldn't trust the results to mean anything, especially as they got very specific things like your earlobes wrong.
My DNA Test Results. I'm WHAT!?\nYou're an Apple superstar. What more do you want to know?
Can i make a request
Upload your zipped raw DNA data to GedMatch and MyHeritage now. They will be different to your 23andMe results. Also GedMatch is far more entertaining to me. Also did you get any bombshell relative discoveries?
Wouldn't Scandinavia be northeastern Europe?
Longer ring finger = male. [:E]  Actually your ring and index fingers are about the same size = feminine.
Hi I'm Scandinavian and I'm watching your videos
Our generation will live to 100
Emma, whats wrong with your neck? Loved the video btw
People experience digestive issues after having omitted certain foods due to bacterial changes in gut. You dont have to be genetically intolerant to bloat from lactose if haven't eaten it in a while... if you can produce the enzyme your body doesn't forget but you probably don't have sufficient bacterial used to digesting lactose and the bacteria you do have will struggle with it\n. Hence bloating. Give it a week or so of eating dairy and there will be more bacteria accustomed to lactose and then less digestive issues. It's all in the gut flora!!
Not that I've ever done one of these massively overrated DNA tests, and most-likely never would unless it was some sort of bizarre gift... why is it as I watched this, it so reminded me of THIS movie: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119177/ :P\n\nEDIT: On a side-note, best highway-robbery money-scam ever... hey, for only £100+ spit in this test-tube we got from the surplus-shop, and we'll tell you your fortune all the way back to the dark ages!  (Saddest part is, this comes from somebody who's huge into science and used to think DNA sciences were quite cutting-edge...)
100% European is the best result.
You're going to die but that just means it will be your own fault
Lpyjuhukmm\n\nJlo
anybody else notice that Emma was on STV news? no? ok
I had an ad for Ancestory before this XD
I could've guessed all that from your nose alone
Okay, so... like I can't afford to do that, but from what you've found out we share a LOT in common. The preference for salty over sweet, freckles everywhere, ring finger longer than index, green eyes that aren't quite green.\n\nClearly we're separated-at-birth twins despite my being nearly an entire year older than you and only 25% European at best
Everyone who subscribes to the channel has a 1000 year love of their mother's father and their family and everything they want\nall you have to do is to have a cannon bone and smile
Nordic, not scandinavian lol. Finland was on the list: it's a part of the Nordic countries but not a Scandinavian country
You call that a lot of freckles?! Lol you should we my brother, he's more freckle than white
I actually went and researched on Neanderthals, fairly interesting. Turns out that they were very smart!
I didn't know it also showed your likelihood for terminal and horrible illnesses. I need to do this now lol
I'm a niggee
and then i just didn't exist😂😂😂😭
Its cool to be Scandinavian? What year is this?
Where does it say you're 14 % scandinavian? The only 14 % is 14 % BROADLY NORTHWESTERN EUROPEAN - which can be anything in North Western Europe. Including the british island, france, germany and scandinavia.
You are so comedic! I'm subscribing to you! 😂
It's not only skandinavian you forgot Russia 🇷🇺.........but yeah I'm pretty sure Russia didn't go on raids and...... yup your probably skandinavian .....
Emma, where did you get your shirt, I lovee it! Best wishes from Germany <3
Why does it matter so much if other Youtubers have made a similar video? If you wanna do it, you do it girl. If it's original- okay fab that's great. If it's not original- then okay still fab that's great!
She must be pretty thick to think she was completely British
Broadly Northwestern European doesn't necessarily mean Scandinavian though. It just means that the DNA could be from any northwestern European area including British & Irish, but it can't be confirmed for sure. It's more likely that that assignment is British and Irish instead of Scandinavian considering her already high British and Irish results.  \n\nMore info on the broadly assignment:\nhttps://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/212186038-Broadly-assigned-and-Unassigned-ancestry
Now that you mention it, I do see the neanderthal.
The asparagus thing is if your pee smells bad after you eat asparagus
I'm never gonna die!\n\n*hits Emma with train*\n\nJk I would never do that..\n\nI would hit her with asparagus instead :D
My family tree has been laid out on my mother's side for generations. Her family came to America from Germany in 1845. When I first got my Ancestry DNA test results, they didn't mention Germany at all! Then I noticed the results were derived from the information they gather about their other customers. So it is rather like going to a fortune teller 🔮 😂
Did she find out that she's white?
YOU WERE FEATURED IN THE APPLE SPECIAL
Adult humans are infact not supposed to drink milk by default thus your body wouldn't naturally produce the enzyme to deal with it. However if u've continually drunk it from childhood ur body has retained the production of that enzyme. So when u stop for a prolonged period your body sorta forgets coz it's not a default enzyme for adults ... thus u have trouble with lactose after
My top fave youtubers -including lovely Emma of course- have done these test now I'm really curious about doing my own DNA test. :P
i sent mine off about 2 months ago, bloody place takes age the latest said due to the hurricane your results will be delayed, i used my heritage for it and it was on offer at 69 pounds, cant wait to see what it says, as for yours that a lot of Neanderthal you have and very rare, means mostly your family has bread slowly over the 10s of thousands of year and stayed close to England.
You're an idiot for taking a dna test without truly understanding the implications of the test and its results. There, question answered
Whenever I see you now, I'm just going to think Neanderthal.
Not to be that person but the broadly Northern European could actually be British still. They just can't pin point what the Northern European is. It doesn't necessarily mean Scandinavia but it's possible
I have been watching Youtubers for years, and now I keep up with a lot less than I use to, but I still keep up with Emma Blackery, and Jenna Marbles because those two just do whatever they feel like doing and its so genuine, and satisfying.
She's like the perfect human
The moment I subbed: When I predicted that she was going to say: I'm gonna live forever a second before she actually said it :D
You think that's a lot of freckles?\n\n\nI'm ginger.
Emma ! Take care of a good own house, you will need it for a long time
So we have established that Emma is perfect?
Where do you get the spit test thing from? X
Yup, yes I knew it\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm Swedish
i very much want to do this, but i'd rather not pay £100
Lmao I didn't know some people couldn't smell asparagus.
She's going to be on the news!!!!!!
I got 61% Eastern European Jewish \n18% Iberian (Portuguese dad) \n12% British (lived in London all my life) \n 2% Irish \n2% African\n1> Caucasian
I got I got I got I got black man skin and white man skin inside my DNA
It's awesome how people uses foolish methods because of they are out of ideas lol
I'm Swedish. Every Swedish like this comment. I want likes so I can be popular
GOING VEGAN FOR 6 MONTHS MADE ME LACTOSE INTOLERANT TOOOOOOOO lol
she's what
is she mad
Those aren't freckles though?
Pause the video at 0:07 hehehe
you are WHAT?! sickening
Your funny..   :)
Hi there fellow Scandinavian.
5:13 - 5:20 😂😂😂
Any army here?
Yeah, us swedes sniffed you out immediately. B)
100% European ? \n😴😴😴😴😴😴
No-one cares.
My swede sense tingles
you fun
Emma gives me Nicky from OITNB vibes.
I LOVE YOUR SHIRT!!!!
24 ON TRENDING! CONGRATS!!!
You are aware that North Western Europe includes the UK, Germany and France as well, right? Not just Scandinavia?
Let's be honest, AmazingPhil was the first one that did this DNA test and that's because he got it free through his mums friend 😂
DNA results come in:\nYour ancestry determines you're likely to start a YouTube channel.\n\nP.S. Your test is free if you make a video about this test.
Your DNA test says yes you are a FREELOADER!!! Stop having people pay your bills LOOSER!!!!!
oh you know that test isn't actually accurate
i simply hate all the movies that come out now days, Even the best directors from the 90s fell for the excesive use of cgi it just looks pathetic, Sorry  but the movie sucked sucked sucked,I think thats the purpose now, to make crappy movies to make people react in a bad way and just enjoy the revenue from the bad publcity wich at the end all kind of publicity is good publicity.
You got anew Sin counter  because the first one broke rlly
Are like you videos nice  Good
I understand the sin of the AI wearing a hood.\n\nI don't understand the logic that leads from 'hood' to 'Eminem' tho.\n\nPerhaps attire varies between our cultures, but it's far from only hiphop folk who wear hoods in my culture. It's generally anybody from middle class downwards who will wear a hood, regardless of individual tastes. Hell, the upper class yoofs probably wear hoods too, just more lowkey than the rest of us. It's difficult to tell because they generally don't mix outside of their own.
Do Everything Wrong With The Thing.
IT!!
What does he mean by dues ex machina?
What is actually your favorite movie?
What counts as a sin? I don't understand what they mean, sometimes they just say information about the film that isn't bad but it counts as a sin? Is there something I'm not getting?
Please do point break remake its horrible and deserves to be sined
Haha besides the cool CGI I still prefer the older Alien movies.
Everything wrong with IT
Do the Doom movie. Its a guilty pleasure.
Everything wrong with IT 
Do IT or i will drag you into the sewers
Everything Wrong With It.
Oh wow... a new Movie Sin Counter. Too bad it'll be broken by Transformers: The Last Knight soon.
My dad always says It's just a movie when ever i complain about the flaws and stupid characters in a film. and i always reply Bullshit, when it comes to alien movies, i have standards. Ridley Scott is destroying this franchise and when people point it out and complain he ignores it and just acts like he's a genius and people don't understand him. Now that i think about it he seems a lot like an angsty emo teenager with and over inflated ego.
Shaw's body is barely decomposed at all, which means David must have killed her only days before the crew of the Covenant arrived. Which also means she lived peacefully with him for years, and was totally fine with him committing genocide and then spending his free time engineering deadly bioweapons
I recommend Focus starring Will Smith and Margot Robbie. 2015
Plz do the bye bye man like if you agree
People call me a xenomorph nerd all you want I don't care but this movie even forgot how xenomorphs REPRODUCE so this is how they multiply :Human must be close to eggy eggy then facehuggy pops out of eggy then facehuggy gets on human face must put embryo in human xenomorph snake pops out and grows to adult in a few hours and then the 2 xenomorphs breed and a eggy pops out DONE

Do Princess Bride you cowards. To be fair, it's pretty close to perfect, so it'd be a short video

what about a everything wrong with Sharknado 4 ?
Do The simpsons movie please
What about the classic Indiana Jones movies? Do those please !
How come you guys have not done the good the bad and the ugly its a classic
Hey, btw in the post-release interviews, it is stated that david uploaded his AI mind into Walter, he didn't have to cut his hand off or change clothes because he simply took over Walter's body. That's why they show that tiny little red lighted object inside Walter when he get's stabbed. It is also why he has all of Walter's access codes to control the ship. I'm guessing he simply hadn't consolidated all the information by the time the whole cabin in the woods moment comes up to remember what to say to Daniels. :)
Everything wrong with it in 13 minutes or less
Ridley Scott should be ashamed of himself to have screwed up the franchise with this pile of rubbish.
I just watched the movie. Sin 99 is what I noticed the most and is so problematic. You can't do so much in such a short period or shouldn't be able to. Also, also, also, the producers really compromised a great opportunity to explore the history and nature of the species on the planet and the 'Engineers' that were on the other planet in the first movie, so to flesh out a lot of backstory. Don't you guys think that should have been the core of the movie? How unfortunate
Everything wrong with the Longest Yard (2005).

I hate cliches, but one of things I love about being gay are all of my gorgeous girlfriends. Guys are jealous and they have no idea if you don't like them they'll never have a chance with one of your babes. I wouldn't doubt if a guy or two saw Skye lift up her shirt and thought how much he wishes he was you 😂😂

Is there beef between Michael and shani cause if there is I'm gonna cry
Seriously the way y'all talk is hella annoying. Don't get me wrong. I'm a fan. but every time y'all talk like that I LITERALLY CRINGE 😣 sometimes I just don't want to watch your vids because of it. Like its cool that y'all have a friends lingo thing going on , but every time.... It's like brooooo!? CRINGE!!!

Cool vid Ben. Fun to watch and makes me want to go back to Laggan. :-)
What's the best way to get sponsored or interest from a company?
Steves dam quick how the hell do you manage to speak that blacks sick satchet of carp lol wtf
Dropper cable lose on the bars?
Nothing more scary in the 70's than an old fridge containing Jimmy Saville and Gary glitter.
1 less VLOG on the trending makes me happy
What happens when the soviets attack and we've smashed all the doors off our Fridges? How will we protect ourselves from the nuclear blast wave?!
I spent the best years of my childhood playing hide n seek in an old fridge....
why the fuck is this trending
I swear they talked about this on a recent Triforce episode?
Don't suppose anyone clicked after being reminded of the Triforce! Podcast?
Why is this on the trending page lmfao
To you, it's just a worn out fridge...\n\nBut to Indiana Jones it's the means to live through the effects of a nuclear bomb.
why the fuck is this trending
My mum knows someone who's child did exactly that and died of suffocation.
Wait a minute, I saw a fridge save Indiana Jones' life from a nuclear bomb  in the kingdom of the Crystal skulls,  and I trust Indy more than I trust the government.
I knew fridges couldn't be trusted. And they all thought I was mad.
Hi, kids. Can you say natural selection?\n\nNo? Well, I'll just leave you alone with this old fridge and we'll see if you make the species stronger or not.
I play with an old fridge everyday and I haven't died yet 👌🏻
All new refrigeration appliances have a magnet which enables the door to be easily opened if someone decides to get inside.\nThis video is just old history.
Is it impossible to open the fridge from the inside? This makes me want to climb inaide one and try it.
Please explain how a video with 35k views gets in trending, YouTube?
Wtf will i use for a castle now
This is serious..i was killed in the 70's by an old fridge.
This campaign must have run deep, I still see white goods dumped, but at least they took the door off
My new video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvJb1bVgVRA more retro fun
It saved Indiana Jones... yep that happened
0:26 OK so now we know how the thousands of missing children over the decades were stuffed in fridges and taken to paedophiles
Maybe they wanted to die, who are we to deny a child the right to death by fridge?
More like killing a child's dreams of killing themselves
In America you eat from the fridge in Soviet Russia fridge eats you
Why does this PIF (Public Information Film) STILL scares the living day lights out of people?.
I've been living with one of these silent killers all my life. Please send help.
At least it would preserve the corpse.
Russian kids would've no problem
Why is this trending? Are fridge deaths on the rise
why is this trending in 2017
Yeh, this would have been much better narrated by pflax as Sean Bean
Now the kids are just eating the entirety of the content in the fridge . .yay obesity . If kids knew they could kill might scare em off a bit
People say this for many things but this is the best example\n\n\nWhy is this trending ?!
This is trending because in a recent episode of Great British Bake Off, one of the presenters (Noel fielding) was locked in a fridge as part of a transition clip I believe, and there were loads of complaints to ofcom about it, as many children have died by getting stuck in old fridges and freezers.
What the fuck
This is trending cos of Noel fecking Fielding isn't it 😅 God damn it Noel, you fridge lurking loon!
Why is this 33 on trending though
Wtf
Kim Jong-Un making this trend?
The triforce podcast
One saved Indiana Jones.
Anyone here from YogPod Triforce?
THANKS EVERYONE!!!
they don't make them like this anymore
Why is this number 14 on trending
This is what YouTube needs more of these old classic British videos
This was on TV recently.
Why is this trending???!? Lol
Old fridges can kill??? Omg didn't know the 70s had sentient fridges. They kept that one hidden... 😱
Chilling
why would i ever go into a fridge?
Indiana jones survived in one
Ok then
I'm well happy something very British is trending. Pleasant surprise uploader or did you kind of expect it? XD
Who the hell keeps an old fridge at home?
Ok. I'll remember
Good!  One less mindless Vlog on trending!
0:13 Boy, that escalated quickly
Why is this trending?
#42 ON TRENDING\n\nWhat?
I'm assuming this public service announcement is so on the nose and heavy handed because something serious happened...
The most British thing ever. FRIDGES ARE THE REAL PROBLEM WAKE UP SHEEPLE
Old fridges can kill!!
Don't play inside of fridges, noted. Thanks again for this. 
why is this trenidng 2011 rly..
The Great British Bake-Off.
It's sad when Google/YouTube promote a 70s ad instead of promoting ads for YouTubers.
The YogPod sent me. Be Warned.
Nowadays the danger of this is invisible because fridges now have magnetic seals instead of locks and they put masking tape over the doors to keep children out.
nuke bomb shield to indaina jones
What a shame! I'm single, on benefits, and I bought a luxury fridge freezer for £2000. It got me into a lot of debt and now I've been evicted. I thought I could live in my fridge as its big enough but I guess not. Oh well, I'll have to shiver on the streets instead.
I remember the BBC broadcasting this child safety film inbetween Jim'll Fix It and Top Of The Tops
the one that absolutely killed me is the fact that he dances to the Five Night at Freddy's Song.\n\n\nIn the news: Horror movie character dances to fan song of horror game
What's the smoke weed song called
I don't feel like dancing - Scissor Sisters
Who suggested pedobear? I love him...

FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY
Didn't Vox do kind of a similar video about the Mona Lisa, and how it only really became famous after it was stolen? Or am I thinking of another channel?
This video left out the civil rights activism. \n1961 saw the Freedom Riders buses traveling south to try to bring challenge the states not enforcing desegregation laws. The supreme court had two major decisions concerning segregation in 60 & 61 that were not being enforced. To Kill A Mockingbird came out just when these conflicts were getting the most national attention, when people wanted to understand the racism this book talked about. Yes paperbacks made it possible for more people to read this book but the civil rights movement was a powerful social change and this book came out with a well told story creating empathy for the movement. This book was a social awakening for many readers.
Now you need to do Guns And Roses
I never read it in California. For my graduating class, when I was in 10th grade, they switched it to the 9th grade curriculum.
Looking forward to the series. But this book will always be my favourite. I learned a lot from it. Most importantly, it taught me to be kind.
So, by the same logic, Huckleberry Finn is overrated too. I read it every year of high school and then again in college as an English major. Give me some dirt on Twain's masterpiece! It's a book I love to hate now.
But you also have to think about what that book was saying and when it was saying it. Racism was huge back then, this was reality. The book hit home for many people and opened discussion that many would never have had. The book could be used as a talking point, and made great material for educational reading. It is also simpler to read than the boring Shakespeare and long winded novels many schools use, so it's a hit among the kids. It's also just generally a really good coming of age story. I think this video undersells To Kill a Mockingbird and what it meant for people at the time, and to people now.
lol first time ive read that book was last years as a freshmen in hs
While I found this interesting, this video also left me disappointed because of it's unnecessary and lengthy content and because I had no idea what the argument was until it was introduced as the answer. This video took a long time to reach the point and went off on multiple tangents that had some relevancy but could have been explained much quicker and without all the do you recognize this? or side stories. For example, around minute 2, the penguin books company is introduced like a key element of the narrative but is then quickly brushed aside to talk about paper backs and never mentioned again. If To Kill a Mockingbird was published by penguin books, then the video cold have gone back and marked it as a successful time for the company, but instead the book was published by J. B. Lippincot & Co. which received no mention. That part frustrated me as penguin books provided nothing to the narrative or argument of why To Kill a Mockingbird was successful. On top of this, we the audience didn't even know what the argument was until the end. I can understand if the idea is to build up to the answer but when many of the talking points had no reason to be in the video at all, the video lacked focus. We the audience were pointed in many directions without a clear understanding of how it had all fit. If the claim The book became popular, not because of it's content, but because of it's medium, then we the audience could look for context clues and how all the stories relate to the main point. I can always appreciate tangent learning like what was attempted here giving stories beyond just the main topic of the video, but in this instance, it frustrated me more than entertained or educated me. This being said, this is my opinion and meant for constructive criticism to be used by the creator. I love these kinds of videos and really hope to see more come out :)
It's a good book but really over rated, I'm getting tired of reading all these black prejudice books! I get it blacks we're not treated equal back then, I get it it's bad, but it's getting to a point where it's ANNOYING!
This video doesn't even answer questions that it brings up itself. I'm not a butthurt fan or anything, I'm from Europe, I really enjoyed To kill a mockingbird, but it's not part of our culture at all. This video is just below Vox standards
I can't wait for them to do an episode on why Vox is so overrated.
They *should* be killed off in favor of digital copies
One example of when the movie is better than the book, and what's more the movie is more IMPORTANT and groundbreaking than the book. The movie changed American film more than the book changed American literature.
now let's look at catcher in the rye
The book was terrible
Why is this thrown in my suggestions that I can't rid of? It's popped up three times. All I can is report. I've never watched a Vox video is my life. Why is this here? Why won't it go away?
I don't like it, not because it's overrated or because I was forced, simply because it's not my style.
It's funny how Atticus Finch has become this symbol of great liberal values when the thing he did in the book was accuse a woman about being raped.
I've never read it
I read the book because of the hype. It was good but certainly not the greatest book of all time by any means.
Who else is reading this in English class?
I tried to read it but... It was boring for the first, like, 20 pages, and that couldn't be a good signal.
do gone with the wind next
Harper Lee died when I was in the 9th grade, my class was in the middle of reading TKMB. We got the news, while we were reading it...
no Oliver Twist? seriously?
I read where the red fern grows and if I remember correctly, it was and is still one of the saddest things I've ever read
I'm really annoyed this won't stop showing in mt feed i'v already seen it.
Now a book series that I find overrated, even though I like it, is the Harry Potter franchise.
I disagree completely. To Kill a Mockingbird is a great book! This is one of three books I was assigned to read in school, enjoyed reading, and read again later because I wanted to (the other two books were Lord of the Flies and Fahrenheit 451). It has a good story, good morals, and isn't too difficult or too obscene for children to read.
I have never read it
all the white kids in my school have read it like 4 times in 2 years
marilyn monroe and john green!!!
I'm waiting for a video on Shakespeare and Lord of the flies.
This is like my masters say this book is good and the other is bad,  so let's find the  reason for it. You never really graduated from college. I bet you think Citizen Kane is the best film of all time...
It's really overrated. I thought it was bleh.
i actively do not like this book
Now do a video why my music is underrated!
this ad Is so annoying
stating that a literary classic is overrated while also having a video about how deep a white painting is is plain hypocrisy
I was never required to read this in school. Weird
okay this makes a lot of sence and I love lernig stuff from these vox videos but like I still love this book like a lot
this is literally the worst book i've ever read
I've never heard of this book before watching this video.
Am I the only one who never read To Kill a Mockingbird in school? No? Okay.
The real question is...why the hell are you moving so much.
I think it's an excellent and inspiring book. I agree that it's overrated though yes
And all this time I thought it was a cookbook.
Idk what schools you went to but my school reads most of the ones you mentioned plus some
I read Night by Ellie Wiesel in 8th
To be fair, though, it really is a damn good book
Im reading that book in class right now
This ideology shows ignorance of history and great literature. It is part of the new brain dead dilettante set. This kind of endless logical fallacy is becoming the norm in an increasingly imbecile population. This kind of twaddle is therefore to be avoided and decried as lies.
Im reading catcher in a rye right now for the second time but i read it first outide of school
Attributing TKAM's success to only one thing is too simple. Another crucial factor, also related to timing, is that the book became a big hit at just the moment when white liberal America wanted to start telling itself it had overcome racism. TKAM's antiracism message allows white people to put racism into the past, which makes it easier to ignore racism in the present. Why else would schools want kids to read it multiple times, while ignoring so many other great books on the subject -- especially books by people of color -- that would challenge the myth that the civil rights movements finally solved the race problem? Plus the book doesn't challenge white supremacy TOO hard, since the protagonist and hero are both white.
I don't find this overrated, but you know what is overrated, catcher in the rye. Horrible book, it has a good meaning, just the character is seriously horrible.
please talk about star wars!
no el dorado is a statue
They only literary acceptable novels that I read was The Kite Runner, Their Eyes Were Watching God, and The Poisonwood Bible. I enjoyed those.\n\nI tried reading Tale of Two Cities but omg what a boring read, only got through 3 chapters. I burned it after we were done with it in class.
If you did NOT read any of the other books, than this book is not 600% better, but infenitly better...
Uh. So it's overrated because of paperback version? I thought you had something in regards to the story.
I finally understand what was meant by the mockingbird quote. 4:49
This is random but I am a 25 year old male, turning 26 on November 16th.
Where a red fern grows is one of my favourite book in my childhood. I read my copy so many times that the binding disintegrated ...
I think this book was successful because of the political climate it entered. The early 60s were right in the heat of the civil rights movement and a book that villified white supremacists while presenting the idea of nonracist whites (because I'm sure even a lot of  white people who fought for integration had racial bias). White people could say I'm like Atticus, I'm not racist
So, first of all, the premise that To Kill a Mockingbird is 600% better than other books not taught is ridiculous. The number of classes that teach this book doesn't measure its greatness, it measures the consensus of its relevance. It not only did the book tackle the problems of racism and prejudice and the need to stand up against it even in the odds are against you. It foretold the turmoil of the mid to late 1960's when the boomers stood up against war and racism... this made it relevant to its time and most school English classes still consider it more relevant than Oliver Twist.\nSecond, I read The Old Man and the Sea and Invisible Man in high school. My sisters read Little Women. My daughter read Pride and Prejudice. Strangely enough, I did not read To Kill a Mockingbird in school. Does that mean, from my perspective, it is underrated? Additionally, we have all read The Diary of Anne Frank. Would you also say that is overrated?\nThird, your argument that the paperback was responsible for its Pulitzer Prize and endurance does not explain why Naked Came the Stranger has not endured. It doesn't explain why the current generation has (thankfully) never heard of Jacqueline Susann, Harold Robbins and Alistair MacLean.
Also important was Harper Lee's connection with Truman Capote. He used his status as an established writer (having published Breakfast at Tiffany's in 1958) to help initiate Lee into the New York literary scene. Of course, she reciprocated by helping Capote research and edit In Cold Blood in the '60s.\n\nAs for the book itself, To Kill a Mockingbird is a great work of children's literature. But it's too facile to be ranked among the best novels of the 20th century.
Yet the most overrated book still is the Bible
Sorry, this is no journalism... Because you read it six times,, as journalist, you shouldn't even imply that it might be 600% better.... sad..
Keeping up with the Kardashians is overrated
I LITERALLY HAVE THIS BOOK IN MY BOOK BAG RIGHT NOOOOOOOWWWW
I do not agree with the video, but this has great content and i look forward to the next episode.
I had to read the Great Gatsby, Lord of the Rings, Great Expectations, Catcher in the Rye, Lolita, Pride and Prejudice, a ton of Shakespeare, the Odyessey, Mythology, along with To Kill a Mockingbird.
im reading this book in school right now
It's my favourite book we studied at school in the UK
To Kill a Mockingbird is liberal media bias and doesn't represent all of us. I'm glad we have Donald Trump as President. He'll fix this!
Calling some of the world's most beloved art overrated? It's a bold move, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off for 'em.
It's because it's one of the few entertaining books you read in English class in almost all schools (Not one of the few good books, entertaining.) the other ones I can think of are The Great Gatsby and Lord of the Flies.
What are you saying? Just because To Kill a Mockingbird got lucky at the time of its release, that makes it less brilliant? A book can be brilliant and get lucky with the time of its publishing, too. Its luck doesn't make it any less amazing.
Yeah... good points. But To Kill a Mockingbird is AMAZING!!!
It's a classic because it tells us something about our world. It is more than just a mere piece of fiction - it was published at a time when the civil rights movement was gaining momentum and exposes the prejudices that occurred in America - written through the eyes of a child the non sensical, ridiculous notion of racism is slammed by Harper Lee. That's why it's a classic. Because it's always the books that mean something which last. Look at pride and prejudice, tess of the d'urbervilles, gatsby, great expectations to name but a few. They've all survived the test of time because they actually comment on societies attitudes. That's why I love literature - not because it's a paper back print!
*sigh* I still haven't found the El Dorado...
1938, 1944, and 1948 penguins look like they that were ran over  o_O

I love love love it fergie ferg.. im so glad your back
New style of an artist making a remix and jumbuling several tracks layered with various flow styles....usual rapper interlude.....im gonna say issa good try, luv the up tempo beat throughout the song, however she's a stronger singer than melodic rhymer...so she should have stuck to that flow more throughout...just my opinion🤗
[Chorus: Fergie]\nLife's a movie, let the camera roll\nFast life moving, ain't no going slow\nThat's right, baby, you already know\nYou already know, hope you're ready\nReady, steady, steady, rocking\n\n[Verse 1: Fergie]\nLet it go, get rolled, I just can't hold\nBack and forth 'cause I'm the girl with soul\nAin't controlling effects, so what the heck\nRock the discotheque 'cause this groove is up next\nTease on the camera, freeze while I animate\nI'm no amateur, I'm a laminate\nI'ma assassinate all the imitates\nThen I'ma take a break, and meditate\nHmm, let me think about it\nPut my little noodle on the problem, then I drink about it\nDrink a little, swig a little, sip a little, spill a little\nFeel a little loopy when I get a little tipsy\nBeez got me feeling like a gypsy\nSmoking on a hookah got me feeling like a hippie, trippy\nGone for a minute and you missed me\nNow Fergie back with a bag full of tricksies, what\n\n[Chorus: Fergie]\nLife's a movie, let the camera roll\nFast life moving, ain't no going slow\nThat's right, baby, you already know\nYou already know, hope you're ready\nReady, steady, steady, rocking
Old school beat! I like that!

[Chorus: Fergie]\nLife's a movie, let the camera roll\nFast life moving, ain't no going slow\nThat's right, baby, you already know\nYou already know, hope you're ready\nReady, steady, steady, rocking\n\n[Verse 1: Fergie]\nLet it go, get rolled, I just can't hold\nBack and forth 'cause I'm the girl with soul\nAin't controlling effects, so what the heck\nRock the discotheque 'cause this groove is up next\nTease on the camera, freeze while I animate\nI'm no amateur, I'm a laminate\nI'ma assassinate all the imitates\nThen I'ma take a break, and meditate\nHmm, let me think about it\nPut my little noodle on the problem, then I drink about it\nDrink a little, swig a little, sip a little, spill a little\nFeel a little loopy when I get a little tipsy\nBeez got me feeling like a gypsy\nSmoking on a hookah got me feeling like a hippie, trippy\nGone for a minute and you missed me\nNow Fergie back with a bag full of tricksies, what\n\n[Chorus: Fergie]\nLife's a movie, let the camera roll\nFast life moving, ain't no going slow\nThat's right, baby, you already know\nYou already know, hope you're ready\nReady, steady, steady, rocking\n\n[Post-Chorus: Fergie]\nThis is how I do, this is how I do\nThis is how I do, this is how I do\n\n[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]\nYo, ayo, let it go, let's go\nI keep a bar like Esco\nI wanna ball, where the nets go?\nI'm on stage, you can stand where the guests go\nBitches is my sons, they don’t wanna leave the nest, though\nThey like, aw, where the ref go?\nI-I got these hoes scared to pass, I got that intercept flow\nI made a movie like Seth Rog'\nAnd since I came in the game, they careers on death row\nDamn, they ain't seen young Nicki in a week\nFive shows, made three millie in a week\nYou are now looking at the the best, the elite\nToo bad you can't go and invest in them critiques\nI’m thick and petite, tell 'em quick, pick a seat\nI pull up in the Ghost, no sheets, trick or treat\nI know they on E, but I don't give a F, though\nBad attitude, but my pussy is the best, though\n\n[Chorus: Fergie]\nLife's a movie, let the camera roll\nFast life moving, ain't no going slow\nThat's right, baby, you already know\nYou already know, hope you're ready\nReady, steady, steady, rocking\n\n[Post-Chorus: Fergie]\nThis is how I do, this is how I do\nThis is how I do, this is how I do\n\n[Verse 3: Fergie]\nCome get some, you little bums\nDudes want the cake, but they can't get a crumb\nFrom the original, sexual, visual dope chick and all that good shit\nCharismatic when I'm at it\nWhen I add it up, I'm mathematic, baby\nTop game, I'm out the attic\nThere you have it, no dramatics, hold the static\nPose for the camera, daddy, I'm vogueing\nBaby, I'm glamorous, and I'm folding\nGrammys and AMAs, I'm holding\nAmazing the way I keep shit frozen\nCool, that's true, got new shoes and a new attitude\nGot my hair did, got a new hairdo\nCome and see me at a venue near you\n\n[Bridge: Fergie]\nI said watch me, I said watch me when I drop it\nJust watch and learn, baby, watch and learn, baby\nIt's hot, it burns so I drop it\nOh baby, watch me when I drop it\nYou didn't know I could drop it like that, did you?\nYou didn't know I could drop it like that, did you?\n\n[Chorus: Fergie]\nLife's a movie, let the camera roll\nFast life moving, ain't no going slow\nThat's right, baby, you already know\nYou already know, hope you're ready\nReady, steady, steady, rocking\n\n[Post-Chorus: Fergie & Nicki Minaj]\nThis is how I do, this is how I do\nThis is how I do, (yeah) this is how I do (yeah)\nThis is how I do, this is how I do\nThis is how I do, this is how I do\n\n[Outro: Nicki Minaj]\nMake some noise for my girl Fergie Ferg\n\nYou are welcome :) <3 <3 <3 <3
Her voice OMG how is she a singer?
The Refrain  of the Song is like ,,Me myself an i
This isn't bad! It reminds me of Clumsy a little! Wayyyy better than MILF!
intro sounds extremely sounds same with DJ Snake you know you want it....
I love the song, but am I the only person who thinks that that chorus is very obliquely
She's gone mad.
Fui el único que noto el trasero de Fergie más grande.. ???
DONA DO ROCK IN RIO <3
O bruno ilogti foi quem dirigiu  esse clipe; ele é o mesmo diretor da anitta! Será que vem Anitta ft. fergie por aí?  ou fergie ft. Pabllo?
Gente é impossível pra Nicki ficar ruim em uma roupa? Mas que divona bicho
Visually very Madonna
Nice homage to Big Daddy Kane!

We lost a little light tonight.
Solo vine a dejar mis respetos. Actorazo.
Rest In Peace you beautiful man.  🎶
One of the greats. will be remembered long time.
He'll be missed - so cool
Hoooly crap. I'm a Mexican guy and also (probably) the biggest Alien film fan ever and this just blew my mind away... awesome performance. Hell, he sang it better and with even more soul than most Mexican singers I've known.
Rest in peace Harry Dean Stanton , your mowies and music will live on .
Quentin Tarantino missed an opportunity to have Harry perform live in his movies...  Rest in peace, you awesome man.
May your hauntingly beautiful giving be always celebrated.  Thank you.
RIP HDS <3
quisiera llorar, quisiera morir de sentimiento...
RIP Harry Dean Stanton! :(
Rest In Peace
RIP Great Harry!
Descansa en paz, Sr. Stanton.
A veces tenemos sueños chiquitos que no le decimos al mundo porque no parecen ser relevantes. Uno de estos sueños era conocer a Harry Dean Stanton. Hoy duele algo dentro de mí y lloro mucho su pérdida.
it does not matter what language, does it?
Si,Cantineras,cortavenas,musica para chupar
increíble canción.... es muy bella.... muy poética y tan bien que la canta... que excelente  cantante es! 😊
Years ago I had the extremely fortunate opportunity to see Harry and his music combo at a small club in L.A. called the Mint.
Yaaa Nuu Savi
SUPRISINGLY GOOD SINGER AS WELL AS ACTOR.CONGRATULATIONS HDS.

What time is the releaseeee? .____. I've been waiting for it for so long, waaaa
When will this MV be out? I'm so confused. Um, it says at the video.. *2017.10.18 Wed* but ut's monday? .___. Um.. help?
They makin jokes out of us for waiting the mv!!! Where's the mv?!
Why it didn't release yet?
WHAT TIME IS THE M/V SUPPOSED TO COME OUT? BY THE WAY I'M IN ENGLAND DOES ANYONE KNOW?
Time?
What  time will they release this??
Đĩ quá cá vàng ơi
It will be release on october?😪 why did they release the teaser so earlier😭
I WANT JEONGYEON TO LOOK AT ME LIKE HOW SHE LOOKED AT CHAEYOUNG
We need to reach 15 million views in 24 hours next come back! Deal?... Probabaly not..
Isn't the MV supposed to be out today
HELLO?! Its the 18th already! where is my music video?!😒
WHAT IF a Filter is not a perfectly mathematical object and it interferes with some light and redirects it?!?!?!?!?!?
Here something:\nWhat if a polarised filter doesn't actually block the light. Instead it just changes the dimensional plane on which it's polarisation is set to (there could me more dimensions than we perceive - look up string theory). This change would mean the photons on the new dimensional plane would  be undetectable to us (making the filter apparently block the light). However, when a third filter is added, it again changes the polarisation of the photons back onto a detectable dimensional plane, making it seam as if the light reappeared.\n\nWhat do you think?
15% + 15% != 25%. Imagine you have 100 candies. 15% gone. OK, 100 - 15 = 85. Now 15% of your candies are gone again. 15% of 85 is 12.75, 85 - 12.75 = 72.25. 100 - 25% = 75, not 72.25.
doesn't no one understand the concept of reorientation or the understanding of a spectrum?
What if filter it self changes the photons polarization ?\n\nOne experiment we can do is.\n\n1st Filter  at 0 degree.\n2nd Filter at 22.5 Degree (15% is blocked)\n3rd Filter at 0 degree. (if more 15% blocked then filter changes polarization of photons)\n\nOne more to prove it properly.\n1st Filter at 0 degree\n2nd filter at 22.5 degree (15% is blocked)\n3rd Filter at 22.5 degree (0 % is blocked by 3rd filter).
Shallower filter angles somehow cause the angle of light wave to shift axially. Higher angles don't. Difference between a corner and a bend.
Could this not also be caused by light scattering effects? Ie. That a filter maybe only emits light along a particularly fine alignment with significant degradation off the angle of alignment, and can accept light from a wider span of alignments with gradual degradation. So a pair of perpendicular filters is light confining the output to a range which can't really make it into the filter with successful scattering, but by having another filter in between at 45' offset, it's able to capture scattered light from the first filter and re-scatter it so that a portion falls along an alignment that's able to make it through the third filter. Any suggestions how to test this?
I followed the argument all the way up to the point where they rotated the filter 90 degrees. Then I ate Cheerios
How does this dudes head not explode?
It seems clear in the demo that filter B is changing how the light is traveling so that it reaches though filter C. There's an effect so there must be a cause. We just can't figure out what it is. I have trouble grasping the entangled light experiment. But if it was executed perfectly then it's saying that filter B doesn't change the way light behaves? That goes against the normal way we'd expect the particles to behave.. there's clearly a missing variable. What could it be
Seems like the obvious answer is that the photon always passes through the polarized filters, but it's altered in some form that we can't detect with the same instruments.
amazing video and great share! im subbed to this channel now!
If light is a wave and waves can be redirected or reoriented it makes a lot of sense.
As scientists have expanded the frontiers of knowledge, they have gradually come to realize that the universe is chock full of mysteries that may forever elude even the cleverest and most persistent of truth-seekers:\nPeople say to me, 'Are you looking for the ultimate laws of physics?' No, I’m not, I’m just looking to find out more about the world and if it turns out there is a simple ultimate law which explains everything, so be it. That would be very nice to discover.\nIf it turns out it’s like an onion with millions of layers and we’re just sick and tired of looking at the layers, then that’s the way it is, but whatever way it comes out it’s nature is there and she is going to come out the way she is, and therefore when we go to investigate it we shouldn’t predecide what it is we’re trying to do except to try to find out more about it. --Richard Feynman
This is an incredible collab and I'm so happy you guys did this! :D
i'm sorry i watched this   my brain  hurts
I'm still trying to understand wave and particle 2 slit experiment until you measure it.
Clearly the photons are not being blocked by the polarizing filter, as originally assumed. The photons are instead becoming phased in such a way that they are invisible/undetectable. This could be tested by measuring the heat rise in the filter. If the Photons are indeed being blocked by the filter then the filter would be absorbing that energy and would heat up. If the filter does not heat up as expected it would be clear that the photons indeed are passing through the filter, just phase aligned so that they are invisible (cancelled out like a standing wave?). When a third filter interacts with the photon it unaligns it and produced the observed results.\n\nIt might be fun to make a laser device that transmits invisibly through two filters only to be received by a third filter and detector at a distance...
i dont understand, but cool! 😂
Could it be that as the photons are moving in a wave  some may naturally be canceling each other out( slightly out of phase) so the light sorce could be potentially brighter and as you add the third filter it may be filtering out those(out of phase) photons and that is why it is brighter ...just a high school education guessing here so take it easy
That's is ASSUMING the speed of light is constant...\n*HINT*\nobservations show Quasars defying that very premise on multiple accounts.
This would seem to validate  There is only ONE electron and that is scary. But, also, you always end up with the same %, so there must be some rule functioning or you would end up with a different result for each experiment.
Wow, this is not at all what is going on... but I guess you can make up anything now days and put it on youtube and make money... How are morons going to know your deceiving them? Throw enough bullshit at the wall and some of it will stick.
Um, photons are waves? Yeah, except when they're particles. Personally I've no problem with this. Sometimes photons appear to act as waves, and sometimes as particles. But it's incorrect to say photons *are* waves or *are* particles.
The slit in the paper experiment could explain that.\nWaves encountering a barrier with a gap cause those rings that expand out from center of that gap. Polarized lenses do this. So, in theory, the light is both polarized and redirected. Two lenses together block the light.  An added lens then twists light so that the last lens is no longer as effective.\nLight through a is blocked at 90deg. Through c is blocked at 180.\n\nLight through a is blocked at 90 deg.  Then b at the interim angle, which is no longer perpendicular to a, so more light gets through.
who else is confused 😝
Here's a simpler possible explanation. Yes, 2 polarized filters (90 degrees) blocks the light, but the filters at 45 degrees (or less) simply rotate the plane of polarization allowing the light to keep passing through successive filters?...similar to optical phenomena that occur in chiral materials (dextro-levo rotary)?
This experiment proves LOCAL hidden variables to be incorrect, but does nothing to tell us about non-local hidden variables. This distinction needs to be clear.  The assumption of the existence of non-local hidden variables is the foundation of DeBroigle-Bohm theory, which I view to be the more correct way to think about quantum mechanics, no matter how controversial that may be (It takes away all the silliness and weirdness that plagues quantum mechanics and makes everything make sense).  The book Quantum Physics without Quantum Philosophy was a big eye opener for me (It was pretty dry and abstract towards the middle with all the group theory, but the beginning chapters are top notch).  Bell himself was a huge proponent of Pilot wave theory after his famous Bell inequality paper.\n\nGood video though.
cant  you talk faster than that ?
it could be the case of a stable harmonic frequency forming thus streamlining the flow of protons through the last filter?
Can you repost without the distraction of music?
Now I know how people feel when I try to describe my CGI artistry...
Here's just a thought that ran across my mind. What if there is light reflected off the filters. think of a crystal laser and how the photons reflect back and forth to create an intense beam. Could you be amplifying and or possibly changing the orientation of the photon Somehow. maybe in the reflection you have the mirror effect there for changing the orientation of the photon there for letting more through the filter. let me know what you guys think
you guys are morons because you're missing the bigger picture . its not that theres some mysterious deciding factor its much more mysterious then you could ever imagine. and it all come down to the double slit experiment the answer to this question will leave you with 1,000 more questions . photons are in the realm of real world science fiction meaning not so fiction anymore . you'll have a hard time believing what I have to say but it but it seems that photons have actual consciousness property's to them or are some how manipulated by human though. experiments that actually give different results depending on weather you observe them or not. basically saying that a photon will act differently when observed and act another way when not observed. so the question is what does observation have to do with the function of a photon ..who knows that's just one of the countless mystery's of the universe.
maybe your logic is all wrong
Adding more filters more gradually shifts the polarization of the photons, therefore more photons make it through the last filter
Wait. Starting with two overlapping polarized filters 90 degrees out of phase, the area of overlap goes dark Then between those two you insert a third filter 45 degrees out of phase and the overlap between all three gets lighter. --But what happens when you rotate the third filter?   I'm guessing as it approaches being in phase with either of the other filters, the light gets darker between all three. This suggests that the middle filter is ramping the angles of light like a car might use a ramp to drive over a wall.
So wearing 3 pairs of sunglasses makes one quantum... that's the secret to seeing all those OBEY signs.
Hope you see this, because i have a question, in the venn diagram, you show some of the 100 photons in the part on the right of the diagram blocked by B by pass through C, but something sticks in my head that surely you need to take account of the fact that if it is blocked by B it would never pass through C? Does this influence the math at all? Thanks for shedding some light on this subject anyway (pun not intended oh god) loved this video!
What about Bohm's theory of wholeness and the implicate order? Wouldn't a seamless whole explain FTL communication?
The proof by contradiction shows that it doesn't follow one specific model, not that it can't be modeled.\nA constraint could exist and be affected by sorting.
The proof by contradiction around 7:00 made sense, but what if it somehow had to do with subtle changes in the electromagnetic field that our instruments are simply too crude to measure? For instance, when the photons interact with a filter they also interact with the electromagnetic field (or something else). That would determine the probability without having to give the photons an intrinsic property of passes through A or B. This sounds far fetched, suggesting something undetectable, but if you watch the video Is This What Quantum Mechanics Looks Like? By Veritasium, he seems to be able to simulate a quantum state with the water's randomness due to imperfections creating those probabilities. \nMaybe I'm just crazy, though. Any thoughts?
👏Light👏exists👏on👏the👏aether.👏
I think it is reasonable to say that there is no mathematical formula to represent this 100% of the time because if  you say that each time a photon attempts to pass through a lens, it has a percent chance to go through or be blocked, then that means that under extreme circumstances, there could be a time in which no light passed through a lens. (where percent to block was\n x%<100)
How the universe works,,they dont even teach you how reality works,, most everyone is lost in the illusions of it all currently.
If you wear 2 pairs of underpants, one of them 180 degrees out of phase (i.e., on backwards) - your farts are actually louder than if you were wearing only one pair or no underpants at all.!!
did you try to rotate the observer's eye with measuring the variation of outbound photons energy simultaneously ?!
Why do you say the filters are blocking the light? How about trying to say they reflect the light? \nFilter a reflects 50% of the light back to the light source and returns 50% to the camera. Filter b and c do the same thing. But now consider the light refecting from b back to a, where it interferes with the light coming trought a going to b, and some of it passes trough a interfering with the light coming from the light source before reaching a.\nIntroducing a 2nd filter after a affects the light passing trough a, so you cant say this is a simple counting exercise that has to add up to 100anymore ( since it never added up to 100, the light passing trough a  added up to 50%, another 50% was reflected back to the light source)\nCan you please repeat this video taking into account the light reflecting between a and the light source, between a and b, between b and c and between c and a and do the sums again so I can see where I am wrong?
I used to work a movie theater with 3d glasses. And there were just thrown into a large bin after the show. So of course we'd take them and play with them. We'd pop out the lenses and do basically the same experiments. It was even coolers because you could make different colors. Yellow and blue, the brownish and purple. It was awesome.\n\nWhat I can figure out why just turning the lenses change the light. What if the light still goes through but our eyes can't detect them? Is there a way to prove that the light is really being deflected and not moved into a spectrum we can't see? Just an idea
What if the polarising filter is also acting like a wave guide, when perpendicular they absorb all the light, when offset at shallower angles, it has the opportunity to influence the plane of the waves enough more get through?
AWESOME! Thanks for making this and spreading the word.
Objection: You cannot know the result of the entanglement pass-through rate because:\nTake AB:\nAssuming the source is regular light(but entangled): The 85% is dependent on the sequential relation that the light passed through A first, that is to say the filter could have modified the hidden variable to produce this result and ergo it cannot be used for entanglement as a given.\nAssuming the source is Polarized to A. This defeats the purpose of the entanglement test because it's still sequential to the original polarization of light.\nTherefore, the % rate that pass through AB via entanglement is simply unknown as you do not know what the INITIAL hidden variable is unless you can actually perform the test. And since you can't actually do that, the theory is moot.
0:48 --> All these filters do is remove light - no, that's a plainly wrong statement.  They also modify the polarization state of the light that does pass through.  Physics isn't a wishy-washy subject.  You have to be extremely careful about the way you phrase things.
this blew right over my head in highschool. Damn, you just blew my mind
What if the filter is curved, not flat? Could that change anything?
What if the shape for the Venn diagram isn't supposed to be a circle?
One distinction that I have never seen mentioned, but which has some possible bearing on the faster than the speed of light issue is that communication between entangled pairs might not simply be FTL.  Instead it may be instantaneous - that is - timeless.  That of course has its own problems, but the nature of time really is a problem anyway.  It might be that there are some fundamental assumptions we have based on experience that are simply misunderstandings of how things really work.
But what if passing through the filter alters the hidden variable? It is a variable after all.
How do we know that the A filters, B filters and C filters are really oriented at 0°, 22.5° and 45° respectively unless they've been calibrated with each other beforehand? If they've been calibrated with each other beforehand, then you have information passing between the two locations and sneaking into the experiment to potentially interact with the photons. If they haven't, then you can't expect that any correlations will appear at all, even if you calibrate them after the fact.\n\nIf we propose that the amplitude that a photon will pass through a filter does not reside wholly in that photon, what happens then? I ask this because this calibration that you would need to do on these widely-separated filters (which must take place at the speed of light) is a way for some clandestine information to sneak into the experiment.
Awww, you missed your chance! 9:45 Unless, somehow, it did so faster than the speed of light, but that would be crazy.  Should have said, But that would be spooky.
Yeah the graphics didn't help. It might as well have been in Hebrew for all I got out of this.
Does the distance between Filters A B and C make a difference?
the filters are re-aligning the orientation of some of the photons. some come it at a given angle, but after they've passed through a filter, that angle has changed.
Light is never a solid ray traveling in one direction. It splashes like water, so adding a third filter would help to channel it.
Id say that the universe is a simulation code made within photons as a quantum cpu instead of 0s and 1s, and what these lenses made is altering the code. \nhope we dont glitch out and crash the program lol
I call this bloat logic. Clearly a polarised filter doesn't simply block a photon spinning on the wrong access but tends to align it to the filter's pole. So if you have a succession of filters that nudge the photon into a different spin, it will turn. All that math is just bull crap for train spotters.
have you took into consideration that the light adapts to have a better chance to go through. or better yet the shaders themselves alter the light wavelengths as it pass thought. this will show that after the first shade the second is at such a shift (90°) that light has only a 50% chance to pass though. but if you add a 3rd at 45° it alters light to give it a better chance to pass through.
Could it be that the filter is changing the frequency of some of the light passing though (ie making them invisible)
the video is wrong. the filters do not absorbe the light
I think one should have a look on the radiation pressure in front of and between the filters, that light might also be forced on another axis or spin that these filters cannot block due to their.. polarization. Somehow I also got that weird idea that Ohm's Law somehow is involved, like having parallel resistors, where the joint resistance is smaller than the lowest value,  resulting in a smaller resistor. I think this is sexy. By now.
Doesn't a wave propagate in all directions? So there is all angles all the time, it can pass through a filter and still travel in all directions after that.
Isn't it simpler to say the polarity of light is rotated by passing through a filter? A photon either rotates to match the filter, or is blocked. You don't need a hidden variable. \nWith entangled particles, it's reasonable to say it's the same particle going forwards or backwards through time. So, from the particle's perspective, it went through one filter, became polarized, bounced off our entangler then went through the other filter. This can still maintain the polarity as the only variable.
or light waves passes through filter but as different waves (not light) as they passes another one, they somehow converts back to lightwaves
So great!  Thanks so much for this video!
The thousand dislike are why we are still using combustion engines.
I always wondered why when I tilted my head whilst wearing sunglasses car windows seemed to get darker! Omg seriously that question has bugged me for so long thank you!
Since photons exist outside of time, from its perspective does it not travel through all the filters at once?
Isn't it possible that the lenses are somehow rotating the waves of light so that they aren't exactly determined by the difference of the angle between the two filters? I mean if regular light hits a polarizer lense, only the light that is traveling at that specific angle will pass. but if you take another lense that isn't exactly opposing that angle some still can get through or be reflected off of whatever is preventing those specific wave angles, hence not 100% opposing to the last filter so some gets through. Another theory is that if light were imagined as a particle, its possible to have wave characteristics in multiple directions. if it were to oscillate along only the X axis then it would oscilate in a straight line, but if it were to also oscillate on the Y axis it would have a spiral effect on the particle. that spiral effect could determine whether it gets through the filter or not just by the mere probability that it lines up with the polarizer at the time it hits it. just a thought
Obviously there's a complete misunderstanding of phase, what polarization is, and what a filter does in this situation.

its so fun, that you didn't even try to say that time has something to do with this.\nand it has to do a lot with it.\n\noh sorry I forgot how various and rich our knowledge about time is...\n\nyeah... its incalculable...
The filters are not just blocking. They are shifting the angle of the photons. Duhhhh
This is simple. The filters spaced less that 45 degrees bump photons a slight bit in a different direction.
I wouldn't be surprised if there weren't a magnetic component to the light that is overcoming or allowed to over come the effect of the filter, and that that effect is dictated or based on relative angle to the filters.
The light you see in the filters are reflected light.  Reflected from some object past the filters which will have affected the polarization . The human eye may not see all of this.  You need an independent counting mechanism. Also,  what happens if the third filter is placed in the third position and moved at all angles? Is this experiment still dark?
The first filter blocks 50% The Second 50% then C Blocks -50%. Its just giving you light but in negative photons that behave like positive photons because is how its percieved/behaves when observed. (By now you tealised i dont know anything about science :D) and I cant spell for shiz.

Wow
17 minute physics
My brain hurts
My Brain exploded
Oh ok
magnets!
probably the bounce.
stoptalkingsogoddamnfast
17-minute physics
My brain hurts
So, assuming that the filter blocks a photon matching a given orientation the those that do pass through A  we know get blocked by C assuming the 90 degree offset between filters A and C, What if each time a photon passes through a given filters its orientation is shifted by a consistent value.  By introducing filter B, any photon that passes through it has its orientation changed in such a way that filter C is not oriented for? \n\nUnless I missed something. Which is very possible.

#21 on trending❗️❗️
Oh, Gucci Guilty. I got it for free when I worked for a magazine, and it was the only perfume missing from my vanity when my house was broken into a few years ago.
Casey, you're finally gonna experience your first fall! Fall in upstate NY is a hell of a lot different than fall in Georgia lol. Wishing you all the best bc i hate fall here. I just want it to be summer and hot and sunny again haha
You're the cutest! Love all your taste in clothes. My skin is like yours minus the rosacea so I always like to hear what skin care you are using. The panoxyl and First Aid Beauty scrubs were good recommendations!
Your fashion items are so cute! Forever 21 unfortunately is a no go for me after having a baby 😂😫
I was already really super excited for fall and then I watched this and I'm even MORE excited for fall!!!!! Thank you Casey!! Now I'm probably going to go to B&BW for candles... (when they're on sale of course) :)
Casi did you get married already?! 😊 that ring looks different ❤️
Anybody know what kind of ring she's wearing?!
I love your makeup look in this video!
make up tutorial on this look please!!!
I'm a big bootie person that's why I love Casey! 😊😊😊😊
Girl your so beautiful and talented! Love your videos :) been a follower for a while
thank you for doing older videos!!!! no one does them anymore- you are the only beauty guru left that is an actual beauty guru still!!! 😍
I seriously watch every single video Casey uploads.  They are gold. 👌🏼
I really enjoyed this video girl😘 you look beautiful!
Please do a Fall look book video 😍😍
Casey, have you tried the colour pop Yes! Palette? I've heard it's a dupe for the Natasha Denona sunset palette. Would love to see you do a comparison.
I love this kind of video!!!!
I'm in California and we havent gotten Fall weather yet and I'm salty bc I wanna light candles & drink pumpkin spice lattes but its too hot!!!!!!!
I live in Southern Louisiana so sadly it doesn't get cold here😅 but my fall essentials are definitely my denim jacket and all of my dark burgundy lipsticks🙌🏻
Casey, check out Rue 21 they have some of the cutest booties
What lippie are you wearing I love it
Casey! There is a new skin care / makeup brand at Walmart called Found. It would be great for you to make a review of it!.
I'd love to see a self tanning video!! I can never do it without having streaks & I also can't get my back!!
Fall is my favorite season. I love everything about it and I love fall YouTube vids!! All the favorites and the makeup tuts😍
Idk why but can't wait for you to get pregnant to see all you buy!!!!
Hey Casey! I am fairly new to YouTube and just started really getting into makeup. I started looking for tutorials on Mary Kay makeup because I signed up to be a consultant but I haven't seen anything on YouTube with people giving a first impressions or even a tutorial on the products. Is Mary  Kay something you've tried or would you ever try it? BTW I've been loving your videos very inspiring! :)
Where is her ring?
omg. I missed this type of video soooo much!! Please keep doing these!!! xoxx
What band is that???
Your video was super 👍👍👍👍
If I was rich I'd get all this lol
calvin kelin made some great thigh high boots last year.. link is included. I'm a southern girl with who lives by thick thighs save lives so these are the ONLY pair that ever fit my calfs or thighs ... my calfs are 16.5-17 around and thigh 24 inches I'm 5'7 oh i have the side and just ordered the leather but have tried both and yes they stretch but keep the shape\n\nhttp://shop.nordstrom.com/s/calvin-klein-polomia-platform-over-the-knee-boot-women/4486446?country=US&currency=USD&cm_mmc=google-_-productads-_-33067284389_-_-96751316&rkg_id=h-3d54b3f22f980b7aae3b6a3d24822196_t-1505628857&adpos=1o2&creative=145503081077&device=c&network=g&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIy4HUncir1gIViSaGCh0nRQCCEAQYAiABEgLJOPD_BwE
Love that lip color! Dying to wear thigh high boots! I understand the big-thigh-need-ties problem! 🙋🏼
I got my Olive Booties from Just Fab!!
They have olive booties at old navy 👍🏻
You should try JustFab for booties. They have an amazing selection, I get booties from them every fall. You have to subscribe 😒 but their quantity and quality is so worth it 👍🏻👢🍂
Girl! Go to Kohls.com\nLook in shoes and filter for boots and the color green!\n\nKohls is the only place I've really seen olive boots!! 😘
omg I died when you were talking about the barefoot dreams cardigan. I am going to ask for one for Christmas and I was sooo skeptical at first but everyone raves about them! I think I might go for the robe though because I am lazy. Loved this video :)
Loving this style of vid Casey! More please.🙌💯My Fall essentials are: a Duster Coat, Olive Utility Jacket, a Baker Boy Hat, A faux Leather Beret, Cashmere Jumpers, Teddy Style Coat/Jacket in Forest Green or Tan, Biker style Suede Jacket in Mustard or Tan and anything Pearl Embellished! 🤗 I love the Leaves scent by Bath & Body Works and Sweater Weather but we can't get them in Ireland! Oh & L'Occitane Almonde Body Oil for the win.😘
Just saw a bunch of olive green booties at dsw today!!
when she held up the Nars blush & I thought it was a elf blush 😭
I love you Casey! 😂
Marshmallow Fireside is THE BEST!! I even use the wallflower in my closet😋Love Fall and all your favorites. 🍁💕💕💕🍁
I post three times a week and... I love fall 😂😂😂 AND IM DYING TO TRY THAT HOURGLASS FOUNDATION. 😭😭😭 That Nars blush has got me feeling some type of way too. I'd love to get some more liquid lips, but that's like the last thing I need. 😂😂
Seriously loved this video! I love fall.
I went to bath & body works last weekend and finally smelled marshmallow fireside for the first time and it smells soo good... I should have bought a couple lol
I need to go candle shopping!
Girl. At the end of the year bath and body works has a sale for all three wick candles are 8.50. Yes you read that right 8 dollars and 50 cents!!!!!!! They normally limit you 15 per customer in store only. I went last year and I thought I was going to die.
Casey you seem so chill and awesome like I wish we could just hang out and go shopping one day lol
Fun and greatFall favorites video! Love Fall! Favorite season ever! Love seeing the leaves changing colors, drinking apple cider, pumpkin spice lattes, going on Fall foliage trips, and of course wearing more dramatic makeup!! ☺️👍👏💃🏿💄🍂🍁🌈
Yes.....keep doing these, don't mind the longer videos🙌🏼
I'm all about olive this fall too!!! Great minds girl! ⭐🍁🍂🍃🍂🍃🍂🍁⭐
OMG is it weird most of these are my fav things? I feel like we just became best friends 👯
Yaaaay for Gucci guilty 😍 it's so amazing 🙂
YA GIRL GOT THE SILICONE WEDDING BAND 👀👀👀👀
Dude. Marshmallow Fireside is hands down THE BEST candle scent that exists. Period!
Anyone think of butts when she said booty.....no one... ok just me.
Yes! I love these videos Casey they do feel like old school YouTube. You should do them more often.
I'll be your best friend 🙋🏼
The shades in that Natasha Denona palette 😍 Loved this Casey! xx
there's some cute olive green booties on 6pm.com !!
Can you do a review on the fenty foundation
I love the color of the top you have on! Lovin that eyeshadow look too! ☺️
I LOVE THIS TYPE OF VIDEO😍
I love how this video is a mix of everything not just makeup 👌
I come alive in the fall time.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     ~the weekend
What shirt are you wearing in this video? Looks super comfy ☺️
Does anyone know what the song at the end is? I can't find it ANYWHERE 😩
omg what song is that for the end?? i love it
Angelica, you are my angel. Your songs always touch my heart and become a bless. My friends and I listen to your songs every day. I am sure everyone who perform in AGT is great, but you are the greatest. Whatever you are going to be, always give your song to become a bless to everyone. Don't care about the haters. Haters are haters. They will always see you in different sides. They choose their life for that. They just wanted to show how they care to their favorite one, or if they do not have any in AGT, probably they are created as people who dislike you because lotsa people love you.  So, Use them as your strength to give the best to your fans. Angelica, you are already the winner. Good luck for the next performance. Greetings from Indonesia.
My tooth just got pulled out at the dentist and I forgot i couldn't talk...oops!

Who else gets chills cause its that great 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Such an Angel and Hale
Wouldn't it be great, whether Angelica wins or loses, if AGT gives a [1 million dollar???] donation to Children's Miracle Network?
she is just WOW...
All I can say is wow
9 Words BEST KID SINGER I'VE EVER SEEN LOVE U ANGELICA
01:22 though. I can do more
Geez, I can imagine her voice is only going to get better as she matures. I don't mean it's lacking by any means, she's amazing but you can hear her youth when she sings. Such a powerful voice and so advanced for a 10 year old.
Am I the only one that loves when she does that high thing with her voice?
Cut the Hi Hi this is Ty Ty crapola, Tyra. It's rather sickening to have to listen to at the end of these clips.
Oh my goodness😱 gave me chills. Such a talented soul ❤️
My sister thinks darci Lynne will win but I think not I think you will win because you are so talented I love you so much I hope you win good luck cutie
Chills throughout whole body ❤️ she needs to win ❤️
I hope she wins America's Got Talent
Angelica is now my favorite singer
She is so pretty💖💖💖💖
Plese angelica sing greatest love of all in the finals😊
waiting for her album..
110% that she would win the finals with a song of Selena Quintanilla.
My daddy said that wow she is just a kid how can she uses different techniques in this song.
I have never had such long goosebumps for like minutes!!
That note at 1:30! Amazing kid!
Wow this is #4 #trending youtube. Can't  wait to see our lovely angel in the Finale 😍 👏  you win it in our 💕 hearts.
She should sing Halo for the finals
I hope she wins
She deserve to win , she is an angel
i hope you become the next whitney houston... my goodness
Wow. Her voice is so beautiful 😭😍
Her superb voice quality matches the amazing stage design behind her. I thought I was watching a concert. 😍
Moana needs to step-up her game. This one was a little shaky.
Oh my word I am blown to pieces with Angelica Hale everytime I watch her and listen to her beautiful huge voice I cry with joy Angel you have a beautiful amazing voice God Bless you and hope you strive to higher goals and you will definately reach the top baby girl go for it  you can do it my fingers are crossed
Has anyone noticed the symbols in her background (alien like faces in-between spears) especially at the beginning? What could they possibly mean? I would like to interpret it this way - we're in for another treat, another spectacular and ethereal performance of Angelica and we're all going to be slayed again!
just you wait when she adds growl in her next performances haha
Best wishes from India...
OMG! Close your eyes at 0:34 to 0:58...it breaks my heart.😭💔😊😍😍😍😍 feels so great!. I love you Angelica. God bless you.
Go angelica..  Winner or not.. U already put a big name of yours in the world of music industry. Im always your fan.. Always..😘😘😘 praying for more success coming to your life..just keep your feet on the ground young lady.. God will always there..
In my opinion if wasn't for Angelica i would not be that interested just like now to this show
she will win i think
She is my favorite @EvieClair @AngieGreen @AngelicaHale @CelineTam @DarciLynne @MandyHarvey my favorite AGT acts!
I want Angelica, Darcie, and Mandy to be the last three, then Angelica to win!
My role model is smaller than me😃you go girl😘
Angelica looks like Xyriel Manabat (Did I spell her name right?), a famous child actress in the Philippines 😍
America you can't handle the truth\n\nhttps://youtu.be/OoVDnTEzeVc
I always wanted to be the first to comment, but there is no way. Who are these people who comment at the speed of light? What Internet do they use? What do they live for? Where they live? What do they eat?
This is perhaps the greatest vocal performance I have ever seen.
That was a fantastic performance
They should change the title from America's Got Talent to Angelica's Got Talent (-_-)  Give me a thumbs up if you liked the new title <3 <3 <3
I really love this little girl❤🌹❤ i prayed you'll win this competiton 💜
you r just wowwwwwww................ amazing voice and shiny personality .... you r already the winner cuz u r the best .... love and kisses
HONESTLY, I DON'T WATCH agt . because i know that this is not a pure singing competition. I  don't like singing puppets, magic, acrobatics, dancers , clowns , impersonators and the rest of the contestants, until i came across ANGELICA. I was really amazed be her powerful, emotional,  and versatile voice. And from then on, i kept on watching AGT only because of ANGELICA. now i am so glad and thankful to our God almighty for having her into the finals. we love you so much ANGELICA!!!! we do hope you win.
am trying to find a word to explain this voice , this voice is more than amazing , she makes the song its  just for her own ,angelica don't give up as your are the best.
1k dislikes? No way
I had chills
She Won!
wow
wow , ahhhmazing girl!
good sound
OMG!  😲
SING IT GURRLLLL
SAD face, CRYING face.....why on TV???
Darci & Angelica shall win together! :)
Its rigged if she doesnt win
this angel is special, OMG this voice
angelica is so much better than celine. this kid will go big, more famous than justin bieber before the age 13 let me tell u
someday it's gonna be American kid's got talent!!!
I love both of them: Celine and Angelica. They have magical voices at their age. They are the gifts from God. In the first time, I felt in love with Celine because of the high notes she showed in My heart will go on. I prefered her performance than Angelica's. But when I heard Clarity, I knew that where my heart was following. Angelica is so amazing. She not only brings us good skills and powerful voice but also the feeling in her songs she sings. Try your best! my young lady. <3
want extra income try this link http://MoneyComeFirst.com/?ref=35487
She is a human launchpad
This has been my favorite performance. Happy late birthday Angelica!
Whistle note betch! Yyyyyaaaassssss!!!!!!!!!

So what should she sing in the finale?\nDNA by Larie Marie Johnson\nThis Woman's Work https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du6rPeSozP0 \nWith You from The Ghost: The Musical\nAngel by Sarah Maclachlan\nFix Ya by Coldplay\nBeautiful by Christina Aguilera\nChandelier by Sia
I like this performance, but I don't like the way she pronounced you as yoh
is over done, she is great but she over did this song,
But what about the eight player mini games, and that would be a great theme to bring back for Mario party 11. Not sure if anyone was a fan of the eight player but I loved having a lot of players at the same time and I hope all Mario party characters from past games show up that would be dreams
Can't wait for this to fail
Why no mario party on the SWITCH??????!!!!!!!!!!!
Who is the blue dressed character?  She seems out of place.
Hopefully the boards are the gonig to the roots of party 1 2 and 3
Shut Up Dude and Watch This Video
This would be perfect for the switch
YOOOOOO THEY GOT CHOMP WASH THAT WAS MY GAME (Edit: They better have the soda one from Mario Party 8 too)
it would be nice if they port this to switch in the future
0:23 out of ALL THE GAMES TO BRING BACK
This should be on Nintendo Switch
Why not for switch too?
A game I can actually buy, and it looks good too... Ahhh, the nostalgia.
Mario Party Advance minigames or riot
Nostalgia
Shoulda been on Switch.
love the idea..... but please on switch
I am the best at the flag and the chain chomp
hey they should put this on the switch
NOOoOOOOSSSSSTTTTTaAAaAAAaALLLGGGIIAAaAAAAaAA
Please Nintendo\nBring Back Butterfly Blitz, Manta Rings, Note To Self, Piranha Pop Star, And Mario's Puzzle Party!
RELEASE DATE??
Gotta love the loads of people that have no idea what they're talking about.
Playable roster: probably the same as star rush's
Why not make a classic or as we say it: GOOD, Mario Party with the remade minigames on the Switch
As an owner of mario party 8, seeing crank to rank made me happy, but at the same time have veitnam flashbacks...\nmy arms just hurts thinking about it...
Release this on Switch -.-. The 3ds is dead.
Mario Party 11 For Nintendo Switch! Who's with me?
Please oh PLEASE bring King of the Thrill from Mario Party 8
The rage that will come from the game
Wouldn't it be awesome if Koopa Kid made a return?
If we're being honest here, I agree with TheBitBlock that they should've done a poll for the community to vote.\n\nAlso, they should release this on both the 3DS and the Switch, because the 3DS version looks like it takes too many assets from Star Rush. Also, it's the 3DS, which has inferior graphics.
I better see Dungeon Duos in the game 😩
I think Hudson has the rights for the mechanics of the previous Mario Party Games (1 to 8)
what about Mario party 11 for Nintendo switch
I hope boo is a playable character
But you have to wonder\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did they choose just 100 minigames from Mario Parties 1-10?
Is it just minigames? Or is there boards too?
I like the idea, but why put it on the 3ds?
This will be the best mario party game ever
i would buy it
Yay, another hellish game Nintendo created to split friendships worldwide!
But do they have DS minigames
Why can't they just release Odyssey on the 3DS?
Bring it to the Switch.
PUT IT ON THE SWITCH WTF
Why is this not on the Switch? I ain't buying this for the 3DS, I wanna play this with my friends.
*sighs* ..... can there PLEASE be wifi this time? No? Well make sure to do it for the next Mario Party game on the Switch!
This is the biggest disappointment of the Nintendo Direct video. It really sucks that this is on the 3DS rather than the Switch. Would be a lot more fun, enjoyable, and comfortable to be able to play on a TV screen with friends. My friends and I like to play 50 turn games. That will not be good to play on a 3DS. The Switch would make a lot more since for this game.
Plz make this for the switch
Hello Nintendo I'm a big big fan of super Mario I hope you coment me
Is toadette in there plz of not I'll be sad
It feels great to recognize most of these, I squealed a lot during this. Finally looking forward to Mario Party again.
*_ITS TIME TO STOP_*
So this is just minigames? :/
How about the Nintendo switch?
Yes. I will probably get this over the holidays.
I would have someone to play this 😍
top 100 o my god
No more crappy car from Mario Party 9 and 10, i want the original soundtracks and old party stages
I can't wait to play it, it look so much fun.
Your advertised party multiplayer console, the Switch, doesnt get the multiplayer party game......yeah right....
I wonder if you can use amiibo on this game
I NEED THIS GAME!
What about Mario party DS minigames you have to include Mario party DS like if you agree
No it needs to be on the switch we don't have Mario part on switch yet
time for a real wario ware game though
that is so cool!
Every single time, I'll pick Yoshi
Sooo why isn't there a switch edition? Lol
I want the fun run minigame
Shut up and take my money!
I haven't bought a Mario Party game since Island Tour. I'm really interested in buying this.
That is a awesome game
N O S T A L G I A
I wish they still did games for Wii U :(
I hope platform peril is on here! !!
Any chance we can get a Mario Party for Switch? I'm really looking forward to one!
Heat Stroke will be in this, calling it right now.
Come To The SWITCH. Thumbs Ups Boys / Gals... Thumbs Up !
Oh my god. They brought back Face Lifters. I can't wait for hideously deformed Bowser faces in glorious 3DS graphics!
Thank you Nintendo
This is throwback!
No online play, huh?
Yyyyeeeesssssss
No DS love?
Yo that suit Mario's wearing in the end, can he wear that in Odyessey. He'd look pretty snazzy :)
o my its looks amazing i am so exited ！！！！！！！！！！！！！
Some of these mini games are NOT worthy of the top 100. But I saw Bumper Balls, so all is forgiven. But I sure wish this was a Switch game instead. I'm still waiting for a Mario Party game that features every board, and every mini game from the entire series.
Mario and his classy outfits.
I want Aces High from Mario Party 3, who's with me?
Fight pub  yfucko
yes!!!
SO  THEY TOOK 10 MINIGAMES FROM EVERY SERIES (1-10)
Why why for nintendo 3ds\nWhy not for nintendo switch >:(
I'm so exited Nintendo
And switch please
Nintendo this is Awesome
Isn't Mario party a home console game?
Should I buy this game or ultra sun

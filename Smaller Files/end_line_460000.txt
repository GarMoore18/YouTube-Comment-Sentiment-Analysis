Conan is literally the funniest TV presenter ever! oh my dayz
Poor Kumail is genuinely embarrassed to hear his voice xD
Omg his Orc voice is hilarious! Nearly choked on my soda :'D
This was just awful..They did not even show the intro of this game
Never clicked on a video so fast :)
Kumail is the best in silicone valley
I feel like nobody would have noticed his voice was the same, if this video didn't exist.
*The planet is overpopulated, overexploited and overpolluted, if humans want to be alive on a living planet, they have to decrease and live better : less births, good consumption (organic, vegetable garden, recycled, renewable...) and reforestation for a living planet (trees, oxygen, climate, biodiversity...).*
Hey I really like the guy, but is there a way to to like,get his voice out, or do i have to cut every orc’s head off that sounds like him.
The voice goes well with that specific orc. Now if the orc was a big brute then it wouldn't have work.
Playing SOM rn and waiting for SOW
He should have played with Stephen Colbert.
I can't wait to recruit Dugz the agonizer as soon as I get this game loo
Lol!!!! God you are a legend Conan!
Conan PLEASE play Metal Gear Solid V Phantom Pain for the next one it would be so priceless to see his reaction to the opening for that game pls upvote if anyone else would want to see that
Conan you my friend are a grade A fuckboy
I hope that voice is real in the game
I only know this guy from Jimmy Kimmel mean tweets
I feel like Kumail's agent originally booked him to voice a Vice City character for the next GTA game, but they accidentally didn't send the recordings back to Rockstar.
Kumail should make a YouTube let’s play of shadow of war
It's not my religion. I just like it - Funny how Kumail thinks that religion isn't fantasy.
they really did not change his voice lol but funny as hell
Apparently Team Coco doesn't read comment section at all. If they did, they would've already announced Conan and Jordan in Italy and Clueless Games would've been with Aaron and not these celebrities.This one was funny though :)
Aw man! The way Kmail is being totally embarassed and ashamed when his character is on screen. Poor guy xD
I really hope they add on death jokes or even if he kills you jokes x'D
This series is so good, it actually calls devs out and put them into the hot seat
I love Kumails attitude towards the game, i am someone whos not the biggest fan of the agonizer or his lines, but i like that kumail can laught along at it for the same reasons i can, despite having done the voice\nhimself
Who want a porn disc
I am hoping he does evil within 2
i only subbed to this channel for these lol
Aaron so cute, Conan so cute, Kumail not so cute
The cringe
Jesus that voice acting....
Game looks dope
ugh Laugh track is so overused!
He is hilarious 🤣
The orc that hates twitter hahaha 1:26
https://youtu.be/Sn1WaIbvTY4
HEIL HITLER
dat entrance lol
Ive never laughed so hard.
Conan had a better voice as an orc then the other dude.
you done f@cked up mate
MDP the MVP
I love Rad Na!!!
LOL That voice acting 😋
This was gold! 😆
I love clueless gamer! Conan is truly clueless...at gaming! LOL!
Conan would make a decent Goblinoidal orc
Do Destiny 2 or Ark
conan make games look bad
Hope conan dose Assassin's creed origins
My ad buffered rip
you have to love all those loot boxes and micro transactions. Nothing makes a game more fun than real money gambling
I can't wait to kill kumails character.
Game doesn't need micro-transactions all I came to say
I never heard an orc sound like that
Wow , LOW BLOW CONAN! Boycott shadow of war! Worst devs ever!
do not buy this game
0:58 One of the coolest things about this game is there are microtransactions, pay to win, masked gambling.\nYes, very cool indeed.
What you guys don’t know... because this comment section doesn’t really reflect the gaming community... is that the gaming community HATES this game. Because they are INSULTINGLY greedy in how they handle their micro transactions.
too bad it's a trash game
*I love how powerful Sam Smith's music can be. He never fails to impress me with his voice and songs. I can't wait for his* *album. We just covered his song Too Good At Goodbyes on our channel, hope you will watch it.*
1:25 has been played a million times love it means alot to me reaches deep
He is the Adele male version sing brother sing
South Africa loves you Sam😍😍😍😘😘💞💖💕💓💜💗💝💟👈👌👌👌
I guess I am the alone one that doesn't pray at the end.
Clap for the soul 👏🏽
He's back guys he's really back
Lord this guy !! What else would one ask for if Sam Smith still does such to us
My heart and soul are moved by this song so much.. It makes me feel happy to be alive ♥️💗♥️
Praying for just a glimmer of hope.....
this gave me take me to church vibes
the choir at the back sounds like group of angels.\nI can't wait to see this song performed live.
Check out this Sam Smith Pray EDM Remix. It's Cool. https://youtu.be/bPfwZ8QWUtw
Teacher: What is Music?\nME: Sam Smith\nTeacher: 100/100
If that is sam, he's lost a bunch of weight
Has  been a legend  song.. #Unboxing_Life
Oh my gosh this song is so amazing ugh I can’t wait for the next song 😩😩😍❤️
Lemme go look for my soul....Sam snatched all of it!
Holy shit balls! My ears just had an eargasm 1,000,000,000 times in the matter of 3 minutes and 43 seconds
where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom 💜
The word pray is so touching feel it so good
The Thrill of it All, due out Nov. 3, (Timbaland-produced) masterminds giving us the best of the best! I'm loving Pray &  Too Good At Goodbyes. Thank You Sam Smith!!!
Sam how could you write a song that's about what I am going through  now 2 times in a  row ...
His voice, thoughts, lyrics, and emotions are not of this world.  The galaxy in which he inhabitants is where I want to be.
his voice makes me weak ❤️, love you Sam. 🙏🏾❤️
Great song my brother!! God bless you!
Prayer does no good except for yourself due to the Placebo Effect. Christian hospitals have found that praying for other never works for others.  God is not listening; there is no god.  Of course their was a creator a la the Big Bang Theory or something like that but all the holy books were written by men of their times. \n\nGood thing there is no god. God debases. I don't believe in myths and in a Bible where parents are to stone and kill children for misbehaving; males can stone and kill false virgins on their wedding night; people are stoned and killed for working on the Sabbath. And this is just a small amount of the nonsense and illogic of the babbling bibles.  Ah the wonderful peaceful New Testament? It shows Jesus indicating morality doesn't count for much. Those who believe in the Son will find everlasting life and those who do not accept Jesus as god will  find and gnashing of teeth at the gates of heaven. What a bastard.\n\n And Jesus believed in slavery: servants obey your master. Jesus knew less about science than pre schoolers of today. Germ Theory? Knowledge of any medical facts in the Bible? It amazes me that religious people aren't a hell of a lot more moral than Atheists. All of those regularly suppressed studies show no difference in morality except that religious people give more to charities as they stupidly think they are buying a stairway to heaven. \n\nReligion is based . . . mainly on fear . . . fear of the mysterious, fear of defeat, fear of death. Fear is the parent of cruelty, and therefore it is no wonder if cruelty and religion have gone hand in hand. . . . My own view on religion is that of Lucretius. I regard it as a disease born of fear and as a source of untold misery to the human race. [Bertrand Russell]\n\nAtheists are way way underrepresented in prison populations ? Only .002% of the prison population in the US. I am not saying they commit less crimes only that Atheists are smartest and commit over 90 percent of the crimes but they fix it so the dumb religious nuts do the time.  Studies show Agnostics morality is as high as believers. Believe me the results of these studies are suppressed by our Christian nation.  Atheists do good and bad as most everyone else but live lives without heaven as the carrot on the stick.\n\nI think decent biology and not being dropped on your head as an infant and good upbringing far outweighs a thousand visits to holy places and millions of prayers.\n\nHey but if it helps you to feel better and superior to me , a doping Agnostic, be my guest.
Wow...Shed a few pounds.\nHow about a happy song!\nYou are a depressing the crap out of everybody.
Here to see what Timbaland music genius did to this.
Literally I just made everyone in the coffee shop shut up so I could listen to this
Waiting for him to sing this live. Oh my God.
damn im atheist i dont know how to feel about this
I want to see his live now!!!!
Ok but who is Susan?
who is 'Susan'? the name is on the brick behind him.
Damn he's so thin
This song is beautifully written and performed! 😳👌
Looks like a letter to the devil! church NO reading the bible NO...am still your disciple etc.. if his not going to church, or admit he doesn't want to read the bible, then, which lord is he the disciple of?
Love this man!!! His music is inspiring😍😍
All of his song is high taste, always masterpiece, masterpiece, and masterpiece .
These lyrics are just awful. Full of tired cliches! Who rights his shit?? Oh he does. 🙄🙄🙄 Yeah - overrated.
That is such a good song, Sam.  I love it.
I like him sing to song \nIt made me feel like him
I've already played this 20 times in one sitting...its so beautiful!!! I can relate to the lyrics
But why must your voice  make beautiful  sounds!
This song is so beautiful ♥
I’m going to his tour in the summer I don’t care if I have to give my soul
Love this! 💞 Very meaningful and timely. Who else thought the same?
Correct me if i'm wrong, but i think this song has nothing to do with religion\n\nIt's about praying and begging the person to stay not for Jesus!
lyrics:\nI'm young and I'm foolish, I've made bad decisions\nI block out the news, turn my back on religion\nDon't have no degree, I'm somewhat naive\nI've made it this far on my own\nBut lately, that shit ain't been getting me higher\nI lift up my head and the world is on fire\nThere's dread in my heart and fear in my bones\nAnd I just don't know what to say\n\nMaybe I'll pray, pray\nMaybe I'll pray\nI've never believed, and you know, but I'm gonna pray\n\nYou won't find me in church (no!) reading the bible (no!)\nI am still here and I'm still your disciple\nI'm down on my knees, I'm begging you please\nI'm broken, alone, and afraid\nI'm not a saint, I'm more of a sinner\nI don't wanna lose, but I fear for the winners\nWhen I try to explain, the words run away\nThat's why I am stood here today\n\nAnd I'm gonna pray, pray\nMaybe I'll pray, pray for a glimmer of hope\nMaybe I'll pray, pray\nMaybe I'll pray\nI've never believed, and you know that I'm gonna\n\nWon't you call me?\nCan we have a one-to-one, please?\nLet's talk about freedom\nEveryone prays in the end\nEveryone prays in the end\nWon't you call me?\nCan we have a one-to-one, please?\nLet's talk about freedom\nEveryone prays in the end\nEveryone prays in the end\n\nOh, and I'm gonna pray, I'm gonna pray\nI'm gonna pray, pray for a glimmer of hope\nMaybe I'll pray, pray\nMaybe I'll pray\nI've never believed, and you know, but I'm gonna pray
Ngl, I thought I was listening to Money money money by Abba when I heard the first chords then I was like DAAAAAAAMN
A real talent. Puts people using auto-tuners to shame.
I made a reaction to this song hope you guys like it lol
He fails to surprise me! He's voice tho!! 🎵🎶❤️😫
These British singers are just killing the singing game.

this is so hozier take me to church
Those vocals though. Can't wait for the album to come out. Gave me shivers and made me cry. No joke. Keep being amazing Sam!
I love this song sooooo much! First it was Too Good At Goodbyes, now it's Pray, I cant wait for the next song, they give me chills
2:32 to the end is just magical!

Fuck Yeah!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Just WOW!!!
Just Awesome  never disappoints ever
Pues sí está mejor que la primera...
God, this is super cringe
You guys are like a discount version of Superfruit\nMitch = Mitch\nGreg = Scott
The world isn't going to end, we are. The world will shake us off like a mild cold.
Making fun of trump is gonna get you raped by little kids in the comments...
What if I can’t whistle
good job blaming everything on trump and people who are good with money.
Your politics are showing
Survival of the richest
What's wrong with Trump
This is the most *cringe* worthy video on the internet. Congrats :/
Isn't the most used language in new Zealand Dutch ?
So we're all just gonna ignore the fact that he's wearing a scouter in the thumbnail?
The being rich makes them guilty and insane..... fucking idiots
I just got a pocket knife under my pillow and a Pringles can in my drawer
Fuck these two guys, they’re assholes who hate people with money
I live in New Zealand 😆😆😆
That white guy is an embarrassment to men everywhere.
Leave new Zealand alone man... that's like the last place where politics and stuff aren't disgusting...
The hosts self righteousness is so cringeworthy.
I love you guys❤ you helped me love science❤
What stops security turning the guns on the rich. Honestly 😂🤣😂 why would I protect you. For what?
All the signs In the Quran about the end are coming true too.
Fuck...these guys are just blatantly politically one sided now. You do realize that some of your viewers might be conservative, right? I was wondering why I was unsubscribed and now I remember. Stop alienating a whole chunk of your viewers and just get the channel back to how it used to be.
When society falls, pot farm. Everyone’s an instant friend. A friend with weed, is a friend indeed.
I've been hording the absolute essentials in case of civilization collapses , Toilet paper and WEED.
God damn I wonder what political party you guys chose. Fucking losers
I don't need to prep. \nI'm just gonna go into the first disaster I see, and *die*
This is one of the most retarded channels in the youtube.I am hoping that the apocalypse arrives soon, so you won't survive beta cucks.
Im poor. Who wants to join me for a raider party.
These two are so stupid i swear
Why would they be guilty? Also why is Trump a factor in our crazy toward apocalypse world? Trump does not equal end of all life because he was elected. If I was part of the 1% I would not feel a single damn thing about the rest of you while I survive.
You can demonize anyone but I bet some Puerto Ricans wish they could have prepped.
Meanwhile both of the two in the video are millionaires who have more money than any of the viewers here, and have not given you any money or help.   Pure hypocrites with liberal agendas.
I remember in the 90's I used to get property for sale catalogues sent to me from ads in the back of magazines I was always trying to get people to chip in with me to buy old missile silos which were very cheap then , I knew there would be a great use for them one day , now I could sell them to Rich cunts for loads of money , and then also no where they all are for the end of the world to pillage with my band of mad max mutant people I'd have following me !
You really need to sit on your hands
The days when men were men and women were women, what happend!
This is so pretentious.
If you're rich buy a condo for the rest of us oh but them buying for themselves is wrong? Lazy assholes
The rest of us crumble.\n\nNo, just you.
Uh, I hate to be the one to awkwardly point this out, but your political bias is showing.
After the revolution comrades shall go to New Zealand to rid the world of what is left of the capitalist class.
Rapture my friends 💕 Our Lord is coming soon! God bless you all! 😄
You don't have to suffer the great wrath of God. Put your trust in Jesus and salvation is promised. I overdosed in 2013 and was brought into the glorious presence of God. Jesus Christ is the truth! God is Love and Light. I made a testimony video if anyone wants to watch. God bless you all in the name of the Lord, Jesus.
except that there are waaaaaaaay more poor people who prep for disasters than wealthy
3:48 but.... I can't whistleblow..... guess I'm just gonna die then
With Trump, natural disasters, North Korea... Jesus Christ, I don't even like the guy but the number of people finding every excuse to put him on the same list as a fucking hurricane is pathetic.
Haha Trump bad! Right guys? Please give me likes and views because of my left wing opinions!
This type of prepping, with stockpiling and stuff will only last a certain amount of time. However, developing skills will keep you going indefinitely.
this is a trash vid
Just need a Vault.
This bunker company, is really getting me a vault tech vibe, like the bunker is going to do experiments...
Christ is coming soon. No life hack would work. Believe in Jesus
Atlease now I know were suzan collins got her idea for district 13 from.
Watch a video on my channel CJ Collins
This is what we can do to survive Armageddon.\nhttps://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/watchtower-no6-2017-november/survive-armageddon/\nI guess it's getting closer as more of us are getting aware of this :o
Money is the least interesting form of wealth.
The music is a bit loud / distracting
lol you can't escape A.I. no matter how rich (obv different story if you're the one somehow in control), the main reason for the fear is because of growing income inequality and the resulting frustration. The government favors corporations and rich individuals while neglecting the rest, making it an inevitability that some kind of uprising or political revolution will eventually occur unless something fundamentally changes. Unchecked greed . . . what a sad way for a great civilization to come to an end.
If it starts to look _that bad_ I'll just kms, fewer people will help all those formerly wealthy people live, since wealth won't matter once they get to their islands as money will be obsolete.
background music is too loud and annoying!
I agree that preparing brings control into peoples lives
Vault tec must be busy right now
Does anyone know why Americans use the word oftentimes? It seems a strange case of a word that sounds antiquated in Britain but is widely used in the US.
if I were rich I would give my money way to all of you liberal cry babies so you can stop crying about he's not my president or I need other people to do this for me and I need more rights because this or that happened to people I don't even know hundreds of years ago so SHUT THE F UP
obumer is the one who well help bring do America. obumer is not only a LYING TRAITOR PIG, but he's also a minion of the Antichrist. Lol, which is probably why he's a LYING TRAITOR. EVIL PIG!!!
Why is Trump a reason for people to prepare for societal breakdown? I think liberals fucking everything up is good enough for me...
Re: the reddit guys eye surgery--as someone with such bad eyesight that I would be disabled w/o prescription eye wear,  it totally makes sense to think about being able to see during a disaster. I've definitely thought of it, and I'm just a regular person. I'd be dead super fast if my glasses broke or couldn't be replaced in a disaster. Surving as a blind person is probably next to impossible in the wild. Just playing devil's advocate on that one...
IMHO these guys are overly flamboyant, a real turn off.
LMAO fantastic garbage video from guys who oddly made a survival topic video have weird political undertones. This was incredibly hard to watch. Maybe you guys so stick to topics you actually know about lol.
Who’s the bottom?
Y is everyone talking about apocalypse nowadays??
Oh you are preparing for the apocalypse and you are not rich, RIGHT WING EXTREMIST SPOTTED! \n\nR u fucking retarded? Like actually this is a medical question.
0:55\nIs that picture supposed to be Joel and Ellie from The Last of Us?
Where's Fetta
Keep Jesus close. God bless Trump
We're gonna get purged.
Did you say Silicone Valley?
Now im getting paranoid...should we prep too?
Bugmen, smug now; dead later.
Why are they bashing trump?
Commie alert
Bum boys yuk . Spot the aids victims 🤣
Fallout
Was that a dragon ball z scouter lmo
Also, a scouter? Really?
Dude with the glasses wouldent survive
This video is very anti trump

You guys are obnoxious af
Trump will save us.
I guess they're also getting scouters to determine power levels of zombies or something XD
Do the world a favor and find them and seal them in like the Pharos of old let it become their crypts.
I don't know why, but I don't like these guys, they are bashing on these people for their money, like what the heck! Some way or another they earned it
With trump kys
Why waste all that money you gotta die sometime
I love this guy!
Something seriously wrong when he isn't gay.
How could you not love this man ❤️❤️
His answers sound like rehearsed monologues.  Does anyone here think these are impromptu responses or is this how he really carries on conversations?
Told her to work on her poker face lol it was a diss but he did it so quick and with the right words omg it took her a second to realize it. I like wendy but hes better at reading people
I dont like him for katy perry poor of her☹️ hes wierd😑
Hahaha!!! I love Russell Brand! He is always so funny and so him! No one else like him!
I love this man....he is so intelligent, its unbelievable! Great show!!
Wendy did not know what to do with this guy? SHE WASN'T READY !! LMAO
This interview was so good. LOL. Laughs galore.
I’m not usually into the long haired , bearded skinny jean wearing skinny types but there is just something so attractive about this guy. \n\nHe is so honest, so humble , so self deprecating  but yet confident and gentleman like. He had a sort of glimmer and kindness in his eyes. Like the type who would donate a lot of money to charity but would do it anonymously. \n\nI always remember the story he told about when he wrote a letter  to Serena Williams propositioning her as he had a huge crush on her.  He knew the story made him sound like an utter fool but still told it. \nGuys who can laugh at themselves are very attractive.
She act'n like hes not high LOL, she must be having Whitney Houston flashbacks, ijs
Funny how the Americans love him. He's so annoying and talks rubbish.
This was hilarious! The American audience didn’t seem to get the English humour in fact they seemed taken aback by some of the stuff he came up with which by English standards were quite mild, Wendy on the other hand was trying to get him to say something controversial about his ex wife but he’s too smart a man to fall for her juvenile low blows
What is this celebrity smack head challenge?  This lefty is as deluded as they come!
He’s a comedian don’t forget. I love comedy that brings you higher. OMG too enlighten for this show. Wendy needs to not ask about Katy  he’s married and watch out trump will try to sue you Russ
This is amazing!!! Seeing Wendy not know how to deal with him is hilarious!
I. Love. This. Interview!!! lol\n\nHe's awesome!
I love his so much, he’s so hilarious 😂
Netflix needs to use some of that money they're getting from that price raise, and give Russell a comedy special.
I'm really bout to buy this book though lol
ok so at first i was like wtf and why?
English humour at its best . Enjoyed the interview . Refreshing to have someone intelligent on there .
This was the best interview I've ever seen on Wendys show. They should have had him for 2 hours so Wendy wasn't so stressed.
He's definitely the most fun guest Wendy has ever had 😊
Wendy tried it.\nI'm not sure why but I really like him
I thought the world was sort of an amusement park - made out of orgasms\n-Russell Brand
Russell Brand is the one person Wendy Williams  could not Handle!.  Go Russell.   Lol
he does make laugh bloody lunatic!
Love his guy
I love him
soooo freaking funnny!!
Good Cheer, nice human, relatively harmless.
love him
Dang. Those hands are huge !
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I love him
❤️
I love the way he talks about Katy Perry :)
You're not meant to judge a book by its cover, but its obvious that Russel is very intelligent from just having a small conversation.
I'm sorry but he's fabulous.\nNot really my type sexually speaking but he is definitely not boring or unappealing.
This is the best Wendy episode I've ever seen
i used to hate him years and years ago in his comedic days but he's fine now.don't mind him at all
Every damn thing about that man is so engaging .
'How dare you insult our culture' 🤣🤣😂😂
Get them to the Greek all over again love it
He looks like he's never taken a shower in his whole life!
lol.he sounds like that bunny from the movie Hop.oh wait..that was him.he's hillarious
He is a true Gemini.....I love the mercurial mind!
Wendy was shook, and I lived for it. Yass Russell
Russells an enfp like me. We're  all about being genuine, good willing and altrusitic. I like that this was reflected in his demeanor. Go Russell :)
i found more useful garbage at my local transfer station..
There is definitely something very appealing about him...very intelligent... I'm sure Wendy wanted to give it to him...cuz I'm sure women just drop it for him!
sometimes you can have two favorites individually that dont go well together. THIS pairing of my two favorites work beautifully.
Great guy. Great sense of humour
IF Wendy had said If I wasnt married you could get it then Russell would have said and I would give it Wendy
Its funny how he won't answer what his wife does for money
He’s really smart, funny and woke
This is one of the best and blessing interviews at least the first part
the only addiction is him :)) he is so fine man
I feel like americans dont understand his humour 😂😂😂
Wendy flustered and not in control!!!!!!!!!!
Addiction is NOT even a word. Addictive is the word.
Russel: ...and the the baby wears its mum like a sleeping bag \nWendy: .....\n\nPriceless.
Wow what a couple of twats
such a great interview. He appears crazy but that guy makes lot of sense, he's intelligent. He owned that interview, Wendy was not ready. The Katy and Amy questions tho but all up my business like a Wendy interview I guess *shrug*
I love Russell Brand! Funny, smart, sexy and previously FU'd. The perfect man!  :)
Lmao!! My crazy butt over here screaming, TALK TO EM RUSS!!!!!\n😅😅😅
I love him, but he is exhausting to watch. He is so energetic. Very smart individual
Have the animals , not yet exploited them ....... \n\nWords strung together that should not be overlooked.
I love Russell but I think most of the audience don't get his humour.
lol, this is the best wendy interview ever, he's a genius!
lol he is so weird but ut works
If I were Russel, I would never come back to her stupid show. He's much too intelligent for her low class publication.
god dog she is nasty\nhow he keep from snatchin that wig off huh
strange man, but interesting and low key smart lol
When he went to sit down i thought he was without a doubt going to whip it out. \nDat out of control presence.
I adore Russell brand
What a scumbag.
Lmfaoooooo this is haliroius
Her boobs make me very happy.
i love Russell hes too funny
7:19 whole attitude changed for 2 sec
He looks like Jesus
Whaaaaaat! 😍
Wow, he's hilarious!
Lmfao The Trumps!
😂😂😂 I love him
hahahahaaa\nbrillant babe
I like him
Yes Russell
Hes not my type.
Loved it!
He's great
I freaking love him!!! So cleaver and witty!
he so hot!
LMAO
Is wendy a dude?
PARKLIFE
The comedy Jim Morrison
WW you got served!
Jenna marbles should do this too!
Also tag Joe Sugg. You know he’d play along and do something funny
Jenna needs to do this,if she hasn't already 😂😂😂😂😂
Lol trending.
I was like, Wow, they're practically the same person! But then I realized that she's literally the same person just older. 😑
I was very drunk I'm Nashville when I watched this. You're welcome, just trying to keep you on brand!🍾🍷🍸🍹🍺
Call it the Throw Back Closet Tag - then they have more to work with for past looks.
How come it's been 6 months since you've gotten 1 million views on a video that wasn't about Jake Paul? You have 3 mil subs tho?...
I'm in school right now for fashion design and this both made me mildly cringe and laugh so hard at the same time :D
I actually really like when Grace makes stuff...
I love that she calls 9th grade Grace a stick bug 😂😂😂 bc like 9th grade me was also a bug. Not sure what kind though. Probably a pillbug.
I caught that lol indeed you are getting there lol
Is it even a Grace Helbig DIY video if there isn't a hot glue gun (and a continuous stream of 'ow's) involved?! :D
I can't believe how adorable baby grace was
You're a pretty :s
What haircut is her hair?
“How many fingers is it holding up” 😂
hOMECOMING IS TONIGHT IM WATCHING GRACE WHILE I STRAIGHTEN MY HAIR
I didn't know she was from south jersey. Shout out my homie
I never had homecoming or prom so I never went through that torture. Also there weren't any cute guys at my school, like none, so that helped. Plus my school was small so not a lot of people.
SIGN UP --> ENTER CODES --> GET PAYED!!\nI made $150 just last night XD\nTrying to get referrals! Help me help you! Thank You!\nhttp://pepiredrsa.win/3522403659458/
Love the cute pics of 'Young Grace'!
That dress in 9th grade looks great!  You need to get a real sewing machine and do a video making a real dress from scratch!  That would be amazing, clearly you have mad sewing skills!!!
oh dude those scrunchie shirts were not exclusive to south jersey i grew up in eastern pennsylvania (okay ... admittedly close to south jersey) & those were huge
Lol is Brooks talking about Iowa? And I actually really like your original sophomore year look
I love your hair Grace 😍
Jenna marbles needs to do this

I'm kidding i'm kidding, i'm kidding ...my social life in 3 sentences
Grace you are beautiful. But I'm sure you knew that. If you did not know now you know, you're life isn't different now.
This WHOLE VIDEO screams JEEEEERSEY IN THE HOOOOUSE!!!
OK, I think its cute. You are too young for me to date, so can I adopt you?
My school’s homecoming is super casual
Grace - I thought your high school photos were cute.  I have more respect for you knowing you made your own dress.
I have my junior year homecoming tonight!
I feel so honoured. Grace Helbig gave me the rude finger.
THIS IS CONTENT I DON'T WANT TO MISS!!!! thank you grace 😘❤️
Loved it! TBH I could watch Grace do pretty much anything and it'd be the best :)
So, finally I got to learn what Homecoming actually is. As a European who is sort of familiar with various American conventions I heard the term. And I knew the Monkees song :D But that was about it. So educational value: check!
Just looking at that black fabric made me sneeze.
I love when you make Jersey videos!  They make me understood and less alone in my small south Jersey home!
That background is killing me lmao why dont u film at ur office now that mr kate fixed the shit out of it?
I would love to see you collab with Tom Lenk - together your fashion recreations would be unstoppable!! 🙏💃💅
How many fingers am I holding up? Just one 🖕  \n\n😂😂😂
damn she had a glow up between 9th and 10th grade
This dress, this hair.... OMG SHE IS SO FUCKING PRETTY. SHE IS A PRINCESS. I'M DEAD
Whatever Happened to Baby Grace
am I the only one that is very bothered by the useless backdrop?
THIS HAS TO BE A THING
Grace I think you just created a really good tag! 👏👏👏
Why do Americans have so many balls/dances throughout their time at school - prom, homecoming, graduation (anything else?). All you get in the UK if you are lucky is a school disco where you drink orange juice and lollipops whilst Disco Don (or some other horrendously names children's entertainer) tries to get you all hyped, forcing you to sing along to age inappropriate songs (basically any song from the nineties/noughties). Having said all of this I wouldn't have changed it for the world!
This is actually a look though
So while I was watching you hot glue that shirt, I remembered that I was going to do some hot gluing myself last night, but totally forgot and left the hot glue gun plugged in. So thanks for unintentionally reminding me to go ahead and turn that bad boy off.
I wanna call it the Throwback Thursday Outifit Tag/ Challenge and I really wanna do it. \nScary thing: I still have the exact outfit I was wearing at prom...
Am I the only one who thinks 10th grade grace looks like zoella?
Your jeans, please.. (I'm sure they cost 200+) what brand are they? I'm a picky pants and am looking for some good jeans.
Grace, You don't need spanx.  I get it. But please understand that you look lovely, always.
Ninth grade Grace is an awkward angel. She could only grow up to be you.
Who did she talk to ???
My school doesn't have homecoming and won't lie in a little mad
That's a great idea!! Throwback Thursday Halloween costume ! 
i love your hair in this grace!!
call it the shitty dress up tag
If celebrity project runway is a thing, I nominate Grace. I'm constantly impressed.
What high school did you go to? (Don’t be concerned I’m not as stalker I just wanna know lol)
This tag is a hard yes!
will she start her own fashion brand?
she looks like New Jersey's Wonder Woman
#formalfails #formalfailures
Should have tagged jenna marbles and arend richard too @jennamarbles @arendrichard

Her fingers look so long ayyy haha

she kinda reminds me of riley from girl meet world with her pog tails
This is all too true
....excuse me but what kind of small, shitty homewtown has an airport???
That nice mall sounds better than the nice mall in my hometown. It's one hallway on a single floor. Only good thing about my hometown is the natural scenery and the pizza. Best pizza in the world in my opinion. Other than that, it's a pretty crappy hometown that I was pretty happy to get away from. Really miss that pizza though.
Man this hurt, I'm still in my ghetto ass hometown
my hometown has only one thing on this list & thts a church
nice try, my hometown is london
Hometowns are great, not crappy at all dude.
I feel bad for CollegeHumor, they never reach the 10 minute mark T^T
I come from a small town of 1500 people. Half of which live in the country.
One nice mall with a Cheesecake Factory and that fountain that kids play in...\n\nHow do they know....
My hometown doesn't have any of these attractions except for the barber shop, high school, and church...
haha yes visiting my trailer park where you get shot by a hick if you're gay. love that place. I got jumped there when i was 12 so im okay
Yeah I know Miami sucks, it's all about that middle of no-where kansas life style ammirite?
all my home town had was the school parking lot after hours  oh and the gas  station
The cop who has been on the force 40 years
Lmao my hometown is chicago one of the most populated cities except not anymore because the cops and cps sucks....
Anyone see the Illuminati
My hometown is Chicago sooooo I don't think I'll have issues with visiting
1) I never left my home town\n2) A zoo? A good mall (implying not only having a mall, but having more than one?!)? an airport for something other than private planes? non-school busses? What kinda fancy town did YOU grow up in?!
This is to real
Jesus is this Traverse city
Zoo? Airport? Mall? Bar? What is you hometown?!?! The best place in my hometown in the Walmart. Every other store is closed down and if you want to eat anything other than fast food, it's either Mexican or Chinese. I envy you. The zoo and mall are an hour away. The bar is 30 minutes. The airport is 2 hours. That is my life.
I lived in Washington my home town is pretty fucking awesome
This spoke to me on a spiritual level
One nice mall? We don't even have one mall.
started it in 144p, switched to 720p missed the fitting 144p, then they brought it back without me having to push a button. pheuph!
Oh my god the quality.
Y'all should make a video about Community College. It's not that bad... but sometimes it feels like this.
My home town has a big greasy pole that we climb up once a year and a school.
These videos used to be good\nWhat happened
It actually sound like a good place.
I like my hometown. Then again, I lived in a priveleged suburban area near Philedelphia  . . .
Used to think Katie had the best videos but now Grant is really hitting them out of the park.
This the good shit dank af will see you later babe
Visited my hometown for the first time in 8 years two months ago. Surely felt that way.
I live in a literal town where the majority of the 6000 people population is in their late 70s to 90s or on their death bed, where the park and the skate park is the only place people my age can go (it's usually wet, vandalised and where all the druggies hang out) and the only good mall is a fucking tesco shop.
... the crappy hometown has more than my hometown
What's sadder, is that my hometown doesn't have a zoo or a mall
my tri-county area has one mall. it's pretty nice compared to most malls I've seen, but no cheesecake factory (that's on the otherside of my city)
My town doesn't even have a mall or anything, or a good airport. all it has is a tiny little plane or 3, OR a zoo..
I grew up in a suburb in Los Angeles. It’s always lit here.
My hometown is New York😏
The Illuminati symbolism is hilarious.  But not really, though.

The cheesecake factory thing was actually really relatable :p
This a nice hometown, niggas over here don't got mall or sushi
Our tiny hometown is charming, certainly better than the cities nearby.
But how do I deal with the six girls I'll see there?
Blaine, WA.... Yay! Only made it 20 miles away to another lame town I still live in....
I really miss my home town. Let's hope that I never have to go back.
From NY.  Does not apply. Still funny though
Ok but like my hometown (which I still live in) has about 2 place to eat, 2 gas stations, a dollar store, a hippy store, a dollhouse store, a dance studio, about a dozen churches, no side walks, and two schools (elementary and middle school). What is all this other stuff you are talking about? There are about 3 malls in my entire state.
Love these shitbirds who get daddy to pay for an apartment in the big city and start thinking they're special. College Humor is garbage.
My home town is San Diego where half the population are tourists.
Your crappy home town actually HAS a mall, cocktail bar, zoo and airport??
So yeah my hometown doesn't have a zoo, mall, etc... We have a few fast food places, a million churches and the one thing that is like our mall is Walmart 😂😂😂
is it me or did I just see an illuminati symbol (0_O
You just described my town absolutely fucking spot on.
The good Mall in my town is half abandoned now.
Damn, your town has a mall?! The biggest store in my hometown is a Piggly Wiggly.
I shall never know the feeling of going back to my crappy hometown\n\nI still live in it
The fuck's a cocktail lounge?
I don't know what you guys are talking about. I love my hometown. Everything important, including the bus stop, is within walking distance. And right near the bus stop is a place that sells these GIANT softie cones. And right between the two in the entrance to a trail that goes past the library, past my neighborhood, and all the way out of town to a bridge where you can watch horses graze. There's a river behind my house I can swim in, it's great!
Lol, anyone who doesn’t live in major city is the worst!!
Is metrosexual not an ok thing to say?
Videos like this make me glad to be from [the suburbs immediately outside of] a big city.
I don't know if you guys ran out of ideas or just lost the people that were creative..... I haven't seen a good video from college humor in a long time.
This guy is a less funny version of Pat Cassels.
My hometown doesn’t have a Cheesecake Factory😂😭
I don't know how people think this is funny. Who wrote this trash? So bad.
lmao my hometown is even crappier than this!\nAt least we have an airport(One (1) gate!), our neighboring towns don't!
My hometown has 7,000 people it doesn't have a mall airport zoo bowling alley or anything it has good resturaunts though and great Mexican food that's about it.
I've moved around 7 times growing up. I don't really have a hometown 😅
when your president is trump but you still can't stop complaining about your hometown... because that's all you have left. i feel you man...
this is nothing short of Perfect.
I moved 2000 miles away from Freeport in the Bahamas to Ecuador the day I turned 18 last year.  I regret NOTHING!
I'm glad I live in a major city...
my home town is better than the city i went to university in.
My hometown is small (Okay it’s Melbourne, FL where NASA is located but still) it has a decent sized airport, on the coastline, has a mall (actually two) has a zoo and a lot of other stuff. I’m living in a bigger city right now with public transport and A LOT of malls.
With all them facilities it doesn't seem like a crappy town
My hometown doesn't even have a walmart😂
My crappy hometown has no zoo, no mall, no nightclubs. It has a few dive bars, and does have a public golf course (but it's very pricy). No nice restaurants, but does have a McDonalds and a Subway. Public transportation.... you either two foot it, bicycle, or drive around the whole 5 min it takes to get from one side of town to the other. My old high school? It's just a dust spot on a plot of land they reused to put in a crappy splash water park (using that term very loosely). Gone is the Olympic sized swimming pool from my childhood. But a TV show did do a location shoot there in the first season of The Bachelor. Mine sucks much worse!
Mine has even less😂😂😂
Sounds like Lexington ky
Yo we prefer disabled to handicapped
Boise Idaho
airport? what airport!
ILLUMINATI CONFRMED!
Visiting Your Crappy Hometown
My homotown is São Paulo

Next gen gun is ok but they should have kept the grips closer to the earlier version.
music at the end... Vangelis?
New gun looks like a super soaker
Why does it have two holes at the end?
Looks like Timecop Beretta with ugly handle. Original is much better.
Still surprised there isn't any Blaster homage in Destiny.
I wonder if Adam is capable of being disappointed, or if his excitement and enthusiasm always carry him beyond his expectations? I have a feeling that Ridley Scott could stub a cigarette out in a dog turd and Adam would be waxing lyrical about the aesthetics.\n\nI mean, the props do look good (as you might expect on a $150million+ production!) but I strongly suspect that however they looked he'd struggle to see anything wrong with them.
Damn it you lazy bastards! Get off yer asses and take & upload a cam already!!
Does Adam Savage Dream of Electric Sheep? Probably not but I bet he dreams of building the 2049 Blade Runner Blaster! ;-)
Adam please made me a accurate blaster please of Deckard. with flasing fire and sounds and heavy handguard
I just realized, is Adam wearing his hat...backwards? xD
I know they're fake guns, but my heart stopped when I saw Adam pointing it right at that dude's chest
And I bet Doug was thinking Adam is such a legend
It's funny. I really don't care about most of this nerdy stuff, but I really enjoy Adam and appreciate the craftsmanship of the people who make these props and replicas so I watch anyway.
Honestly... the reason movies these days loose the excitement of older movies is because everything is CG! If you're making a gun, make it fire! Stop going the cheap and easy route of making fake props!
Where is the boring bald chap?
2 Blasters. Not a spectrum of Blasters, Adam.
cg muzzle flashes look like crap. the issue isnt the flame itself, its the way it (doesnt) light the things around it realistically.
Is it just me, or does the old gun look way better? The new one looks like a goofy and generic comic book rip.
Thsnks Adam
Wrong ...most iconik gun is dirty harrys magnum.
No close Ups?
That Gun
why is adams' hat brim backwards?
sorry they ruined it
That's a borderland gun lmao. Jakobs'
Just give 1 blaster to Adam and he will turn the world upside down for you Doug)))
Implication previous alternative famous angle light comprehensive way age sequence.
At least for this iteration of gun you wont have to look at a thousand hours of vhs hold, I sure they will share the g-code files this time
3:14 I don't like that!
5:27 I loved the guns in oblivion . I know he's talking about the movie, but I find it funny for some reason
The new one is surprisingly unimpressive.
Dem chicken strips\nDo you ever turn on that bike?
due to design similarities between the old and new gun.\nthey could use a high-speed camera to catch the muzzle flash from the old gun against a green screen and use that as the base for their new gun's blast.\n\nA bit of a mix of practicle and computer effects.
boom operator fired I saw it
You get to get to do some way cool stuff Adam!!!!
Beautiful pieces. I adore watching Adam get so excited about props and design. It is so wonderful to see a person be so passionate about his craft and his fellow craftspersons. Adam's the ultimate prop-tart and we love him for it.
I love that jacket at the start and finish.
Adam and his Blaster again 😂
After the crime spree that occurred in Las Vegas, it’s appalling that you would post this on a YouTube. Remove this video immediately or else my organization will slam the might of our collective to banish you from YouTube and every other social media site. You have been warned you trifling heathen! Damn... all you crackerz are all the same! What is it with you and weapons?????
God that seems like such a cool job!
Will replicas be available soon. And if so, where do I find them? I''m desperate to buy one but don't know where to look.
How to make Adam nerdgasm in one easy step. :-)
You can't but be happy for Adam... So happy that you got to play with the guns!
...The original blaster is probably also my favorite movie prop ever... but I might like the new one better. It's clearly inspired heavily by the original yet is wholly unique, with a fantastic color and heft. \n\nI'm not a gun guy but this is why I love futuristic weapons and tech design.
He sounds a little like Saruman!
The prop master is so Hollywood. He’s cool tho
3:50 ish\nwanted to make it as interesting as possible aka.. make it complicated as fuck so that people will shit their own brains trying to replicate it.\nHuman beings love puzzles though. IT WILL BE SOLVED.
Something about the 'new version' feel like antiques.   I would have rather seen an electric pistol with caseless rounds stacked in barrel.  It'd be much more accurate where handguns are going in the next 50 years, but.. meh.. nostalgia seems to be this movie's first master.
You just know this video was coming.
Hey, could anyone tell me what's the name of the song from the very end of the video when Adam plays with blasters?
I can easely bet a million that Adam doesn't care that much for the new guns as he does for the original, even the way he speaks ozzes with the sort of ohh, thats cool and all, but deckardsl gun is all I care mentality
How would you go about making one from scratch? The original was based off an actual gun with model pieces on it. The new one is fabricated in house.
Great Video, Beautiful guns .... check out the Whiskey Bottles in the background.
I honestly think both blasters are great
Just watching Adam being so happy is enough to like this video :)
make one day build videos...that's why I subscribed
It is not a gun if it can not fire a bullet.
Did you need a Grinectomy?
Let the boy take it home with him
0:22 when she sees ur 5.3 inch dick for the first time
When I noticed the new blaster in the trailer I was definitely like Adam, just obsessively gazing over every frame I could to get a clear look at it. And then I saw it in a poster and felt it was meh. But getting a clear view of them in this video manages to showcase the beauty of the new design and how it nods to the original. Just amazing work, and I cant wait to see it in action in the new film!
You can tell Adam is unfamiliar with firearms as at 01:46 he is aiming the pointy end at the other chap.
This video game me goosebumps at the end
Aw..  He had so much fun.
New blderunner's gun is looking like peace of shirt :(((
Ducati 1098 in the back 👍
I can’t wait to see Adam make the new blaster!
hope someone build a real blaster with this design. Way cool! :p
The new blaster isn't functionally credible - there's no place for the bullets and no apparent way to load them. The inability to fire blanks means they have to resort to a CGI cop out - this new blaster is a total fail! I don't blame the person who made it - I blame the director for allowing him to get away with it. Which means the director may not really understand what made the original film (and blaster) great. I smell a flop. Shame on Ridley for not directing it himself.
Good for you Adam. You're like a nery ungle to me and I will always admire and apreceate your enthusiasm for the craft. Love you man! Do the voodoo you do and never stop!
What if they were just like oh these are for you and just gave him all of those blasters.
Now that's someone I would love to meet.  What a fun job that must be!
That guy does a decent Harrison Ford impression lol give me the rubber one!
I think Adam found his soul mate. *Side note why didn't the producers hire Adam for this job??
never have i ever seen such a happy child!
0:44 Oh my god, he is trying SO hard not to squee!
just what i was hoping to see after watching the movie!!
Nice Johnnie Walker collection.
replicas or replicants ?
You Lucky Blaster'd
Nice 🔫
funny that Harlocker mentioned District 9. He's Sharlto Copley's doppelganger.
Las vegas
That Gun.
6 ounces = 170.097139 grams\n8 ounces = 226.796185 grams
Blade Runner 2049 a masterpiece movie! ❤
Get a room
CG muzzle flash, CG blood splatter, damn all of that CG crap.
seems like he realy got blasted away.....
Replicated the gun blasters...pun intended?
Too early...
yawn
Love it Love it Love it!
tested in 2049
CG muzzle flashes is kinda bunk it looks good on screen but in my opinion but it would of been a lot cooler if it was a fully functional firearm instead of just the trigger functioning that would of been one of the coolest guns to take to the range
Look it up that gun fallout new Vegas Bethesda can sew
CG muzzle flashes are something I'm okay with. Losing Brandon Lee to a freak accident with a blank is enough to make me not mind them using fake bullets when shooting at people.
rubber looks real
Doug should have given credit to Tomenosuke & Adam knows better. They may have made one Hero from scratch but most of those blasters are a kit from Tomenosuke; not fabricated by hand from scratch like he is claiming.\n\nThat is why Adam is not raving over the classic blasters and is fascinated by the rubber one and the new versions.  It's because he knows what they are and has several.
Now this is real music!
It’s so great to see this on trending!!! I’m so proud of you nf
Honestly this album is a masterpiece...everytime I put it on I drift into a place where I’m not always depressed, I don’t care what people think, I’m not lonely and wanna cry all the time. When I put this album on I go to a place I love, I have confidence, I don’t care what people think. Yesterday I swear I had withdrawal symptoms from it cause I had work and couldn’t listen to it
Nate my boy, you’re killin it!
So good! Made it in trending so proud of him!
Sounds a lot like Eminem to me, sounds pretty good but doesn't feel original.
Nf your family is getting bigger God bless you bro keep it up
He sounds so much like Eminem
You youngins need to chill with the us poor little persecuted christians go read a fuckin history book. Oh and btw, heres a little secret, love NF, but there are no invisible sky daddies watching you. The quicker you learn this, the less persecuted youll feel.
Sooner they will be the outcast with Music like this. Fiiree
I just want to say he always makes fantastic songs
Bet it !! This Song is Going to blow up Rap industry in 2017
Best song ever been here since mansions\n\n\n\n\n\n🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
wow this is really good
My dog listened to this, now he's a dawg
I got so excited when I thought it was Eminem
NF has always been Fire 🔥🔥
Finally NF is getting the recognition he deserves I've been waiting awhile
The resurrection of Good music
OMG NF YOU'RE FREAKING AMAZING! You have helped me so much and I pray you're doing ok. I know this may have been tough for you, but exciting at the same time.  You're an inspiration and thanks for being so transparent.  Feels good to know I'm not alone and I'm sure I speak for a lot of other people when I say that. Love ya Nate! Keep it up, man!😀😎
YOUR bars literally punch me in the chest my god there so powerful your the most underrated rapper right now
#16 on trending NF is blowing up he will always notice the real fans people that’s LISTEN deeply and peace apart his music feeling every lyric
this song causes me pain because it makes me feel so confused just like he feels about it all..
Man its sad how people like lil yachty get more attention than music like this:(
This speaks to me on a personal level
If NF becomes the best rapper ever I won't be surprised
Now this is rap.
i found you again and im so happy
im honestly annoyed i havnt heard of this guy sooner...
Fuck I thought this was new outcast music , I guess why reading is fundamental
I got my own shoes, I ain't trying to fit in yours favorite line in the song. Question though he said like I'm joker like mike Posner. Did mike Posner have a song called joker or something? Cause I'm confused.
trending again. Okay, i see you!
NF is killing it keep it kid
Good song Eminem Jr. You're one of the best of our generation.
I'm in this music video!!! Turned out so good!
this dude has the voice that he is always mad. I was fucking with it for a second but- I don't know fam.
There you to Nf let's go
I'm over here still wondering why he hasn't own a Grammy
This song is straight fiya! NF, I really hope that that wasn't a masonic shake @1:23. Hope you didn't sellout/or are thinking about selling out to blow up. Praying for you bro!
Easily one of his best songs so far ! Possibly the song of the year
Okay I can't be the only one who thinks this guy is like to spitting image of Eminem,  like flow and look it's uncanny
Yo this is actually fire ass lryics 😎😎
the choris was a bit lacking
Also id like to point that it's crazy seeing these new people out of no where, I've been there since therapy session just released and I'm here to stay!! #realmusictillthedaywedie
Part of me wants NF to go crazy mainstream, but a part of me will always want him to be an artist that only his true fans know about. Either way NF IS FIRE!!!
Major Eminem vibes. I like this.
Got some major eminem vibes from this
Him and Hopsin need to do a song together
NF and Token should collab, take over this genre
This song is totally for me...outcast!!!
NF fans are the best no negativity. Just scrolling threw the comments is just the best. NF deserves to blow up!
is anyone ready for the new album!!! btw love the song
Could have been the next eminem then he started screaming outcast. That's where it all went wrong but other than that this shit is pretty fire
I'm a hardcore Eminem fan and I think that this is some awesome stuff. NF is great at what he does and especially for not swearing
Who would win nf or eminem??
Listen to it slowed down to\n.75 speed
The Cars behind this dude at 1:00 must have been SO confused if they couldn’t see the camera equipment. Like “Da fuck this dude doing?!” Then I roll up next to them and be like “He’s making the feels happen right now my dude!!”
Finally a rapper who doesn't have to cuss to spit bars
Whose here before 1 million views??
Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved
Just because he's christian it doesn't blow up, I LOVE GOD.... This is what happens when you have God in you not many want to follow your steps but thanks to God its all his will... hopefully one day this album could blow up to teach people real life lessons that can touch their spirit and help them accept Jesus christ as their only one and savior ❤❤❤❤❤💪
He reminds me Eminem 👑
Quit Sleeping on NF

This EMINEM 2.0🔥🔥🔥
Julia Roberts has the most memorable movie lines, I love her since until now she's not aging she still looks good at her age. Runaway Bride, Notting Hill, My Best Friend's Wedding, Pretty Woman are my favorites film of her and I'm so excited for Wonder :-)
DO THIS WITH MERYL PLEASE
I wish they added her tv appearances my fave was friends where she got even with chandler 🤣❤️
I have exams coming up and I rrrreally want to binge watch her movies. Damn it.
And this is exactly funny how :? CBS pls bring Craigy Ferg back!!!
Julia is so talented and beautiful
this was so amazing!!
Love her!  Pretty woman will always be my fave!  Such a great movie.. she looks beautiful!
I don't think there's any one movie they reenacted that I don't like.  Most of her films are some of my favorites like Pretty Woman, Erin Brockovich, Notting Hill,  My Best Friend's Wedding, Flatliners, Steel Magnolias, The Pelican Brief, and Mystic Pizza.  They left out I Love Trouble, Something to Talk About, and Duplicity, but those are the few that people don't remember.
Julia is fantastic, as always. James is hillareous.
Awww. So sweet. Julia Roberts has the most famous smile in the world i think but she's as lovely even when she's trying to NOT smile and hold her chuckles in!!!! James Corden is a true fan...like one of us.. that's why his show his awesome.
What about that one movie where she did that horrible Irish accent
hahah this is amazing. I wish he would do this with meryl streep
I love that James sounds more excited than other hosts when he says the name of his guests.
I drink their blood!
So hilarious I love this !
i was waiting for 13 going on 30...☹️
Where is Conspiracy Theory? What a fail...
Still my favorite actress! I will always love her! Don’t know why I was watching Pretty Woman at 5 but 🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️😂😂😂
Julia is a legend.
Thanks for reminding me how much I adore both of you!
I keep thinking of family Guy whenever I see Julia Roberts, Lois says her lips look like a baboons ass, lol
Love Julia Roberts so much, I wish I could meet her, say hello, take a picture and just have a chat. She seems so nice and friendly.
I am curious. Is James Gay?
my best friends wedding for the win!!!! <3
Wow she looks good for 80\n
Such an amazing actress. Always loved her.
Spider and pig looked real.  Julia had more surprises
I think it would have been hilarious if they did August: Osage County, either the tackling to get the pills scene or Eat the fish, bitch! one 😂😂
This made my day 😂

Best one pretty woman!

Love Julia, love James, love this clip! So well done <3
She's still got it
She's an absolute legend and her films are awesome, so many brilliant ones!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
His Law was right in focus.:D
Julia made a huge mistake being in mirror mirror. Awful movie
the fuck, how many movies she been in
OMG! This is the best!!
I love her! Step mom love that movie!!
I have watched it more than 20 times! It's where dreams are made.
Oh shit, I never knew that was her who played Charlotte.
It's is so ironic that Julia is on James's show;  he once said in an interview that he drunk in a bar in New York and ran into Julia , took her hand and said you've got it :D\nIt's so great to see how far he has come :')
i just realized ive seen almost all of those movies lol\nexcept for 3
How does she stay so damn good looking ?? Great genes!!
Lo ve y'all!
woahh some of them i had no idea Robert was in it 😂😂😂

Even though she couldn't contain her laugh on Stepmom bit, she still managed to get me to form tears in my eyes. Bravo Julia, bravo!
Wtf were half those movies :D :D :D
I SAAAY A LITTLE PRAY FOR YOUUUU
This is hilarious and it's amazing that Julia can memorize all these different lines.   I would love to see her do SNL>
HAIRY ARMPITS
man did she own the 90s. will always be a fan.
Nothing but good vibes from this woman! And idk why I got so emotional when they acted out the pretty woman scene
GENIUS
I love Julia!!!!
She seems like she would be so fun to hang out with! Great ending : )
Julia is cool and all, but i just realized i dont know half of the films she was in.... I like the Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks videology better.... just me...
This basically proved to me that I don't know a LOT of Julia Roberts' movies. And I'm okay with that.
She makes my man parts stand proud 😐
she's beautiful
😂😂 she's so beautiful
Do this with Meryl Streep please!
some of the greatest movies ever Thank you Julia!
Why is 'Wonder' in the middle when it is supposed to be the end?? Seems like not following timeline (if you know what I mean).. eitherway, Julia is good! Should do more of these Act Out Film Career.. I support!! xoxo
Damn, always wearing a damn cardigan
the best actress in the world
I love My Best Friend’s Wedding so much 😂
The best female romcom protagonist for 90s babies
She had a hard time keeping it together. LOL that was awesome!
What about August: Osage county
Wow. I never realised Julia Roberts was in so many movies I never cared about.
They forgot Dying Young or did i miss it?
Notting Hill and Pretty Woman her best films by far.
Love the steel magnolias one 😂😂😂😂 and that step mom wig made me LOL.
I have heard that this guy is a right arsehole in real life
Lovely moments in there James.
THERE'S HOPE FOR AGING😍
Lol
thats awesome

That's amazing!!
My 2 favorite make up artists finally did a collab 😭💖💖💖💖
I’m dead lmao I can only do brows mascara and highlight in ten minutes 😂
You’re both so amazing!! I totally love you Jaclyn! You’re so comfortable with who you are and you not afraid to be you even when you’re a total mess. I suffer from bad anxiety and I literally was having a moment until I watched this video. It was like the tears that was going to drop evaporated. I never miss one of your uploads and your bloopers make them even more amazing! I love you both! Thank you. 😘
Why didn't you guys just go to 6 minutes? Like 4 plus 6 equals 10 😂😂😂😂

Jaclyn - What brush were you using for your powder? It was a large brush with a white handle. Thanks!
You both did amazing. But Jaclyn takes the win. Live both of you. You're both so sweet and I'm so happy that you're able to make a living doing something that you love and are so skilled at.

Okay Jaclyn I have a question for you, naturally I have very dry skin and when I apply my make up I don’t get full coverage and you can see all of the horrible texture of my skin, I wash my face normally and use a very good moisturizer and when I apply make up i always use primer. What in the world am I doing wrong??
Please stop I am dying over here🤣🤣🤣🤣 Jaclyn love your sense of humor♥️♥️😆😆
I literally peed myself while watching this. Love love love you guys!!! <3

It's hard but I'd have to say Jaclyn
I have never been so stressed watching a video

I’m mexican and I personally don’t like menudo, but I think is really disrespectful what you said, and don’t get me wrong but I think you shouldn’t say or say it in other words, but that is just my opinion. I still love you and your vlogs ❤️
Pigs are the only animal where we use every part of it! 
That is not even a proper English breakfast like where's the baked beans toast ?? Sausage bacon scrambled eggs ?!
Black pudding is made out of pigs blood ;)
Pig blood is the main ingredient in pudding white and black x
It's pigs blood 😂😂
Dinuguan is good and a part of the Filipino traditions try it first its not that bad so please dont make us feel bad getting it :'(
Black pudding is made up of pigs blood, mmm appetizing 😂💓
Congrats on giving your dog it’s first ear infection
Hanalei is like a child, she is so adorable
I love her name. She’s perfect. 😍
Menudo is actually pretty good. It's tasty tbh 😋
YAY VEGAN COOKIES YAS, I'm glad she didn't just get reg cookies lowkey just bc like some fans will just do that for vegan yters. If that makes any sense.
I will never listen to you again. TRIPE?!? What the heck
London was so much fun I went there spring break including France
“Shampoo time!”\nEva: “What flavour is it?”

Filipino menudo is made out of pork though and tomato sauce (it says calf liver but I think not all have)
Tripe is put into menudo a Mexican type of soup, honestly it’s not bad at all. my family cooks it all the time for the winter and I enjoy eating, it’s actually really good!
Black pudding I don't like it but that's the United Kingdom for you 😂

The black pudding i know of and love has cow's blood but some may have pig's blood x3 i see how that sounds gross lmao but it tastes so good xD ahhhhh
Your puppy is so cute!!
Eva should start showing us on how she does her makeup because it always looks bomb!
noooooo i look before you said i dont recommend and i am scared i had to stop for like 5 minutes to know if i was going to through up or not lol
Here in Portugal, black pudding it's called morcela
four cups of pig blood -_-
Do you think they were just trying to scare you because it was Halloween by saying they put blood in it? 😂
Love your dog kinda reminds me of Kong xD (Logans dog)
The black pudding is made out of pork fat or beef suet and pork blood and high protein oatmeal oat groats and sometimes barley groats at least that’s what I think it is I searched it and that’s what it said
So cute oh and just starting your vlogs gunna love it! Just starting this one but this is so cool and love your main channel
Eva you were so sweet, at the meet & greet .

Menudo is actually a Mexican soup. My grandma makes it literally makes it whenever family is over so thats like an every Friday thru Saturday thing😂
Eva just a little tip try not to get water in the dogs ears because dogs can get ear infections from getting water in their ears and by the way I love you😘😍💙

Eva I have something important that you should know about golden retrivers!! A lot of the get hot spots which is an infection. If Hanalei gets hot spots then you may have to switch shampoos. I had to ;(
I knew what kind of blood it was cuz of the dolan twins 😭😻😹💕\ni just love eva and dolan twins
When you first said me and Dan, I assumed you were talking about Daniel J Layton
not loving the higher fps used for talking vlogs, theres so little visual information needed in these videos that they always have the feeling of being fast forwarded (esp with hannah's naturally fast paced delivery)\n\ngreat favorites video otherwise!
Omg Hannah I've commented this before and I am honestly sorry for repeating myself, but if you like your romantic comedy tropes deconstructed, then give Crazy Ex Girlfriend another go!!!  I swear every other favourites video you give me another reason to be sure that it's basically made for you. But, you know, no pressure. :)
I work in technical theatre and I had the opportunity to shadow the touring stage manager for Wicked one year. Best experience of my life, that show is amazing!! \nI’ve never had a chance to experience an Immersion theatre show, but I get so excited every time I hear about one. I’m so glad you shared!!
You hair looks longer because it probably is - they often do that when you have a side part. :-P
The star actor in The Big Sick is Kumail Nanjiani.
I'm seeing First Aid Kit next week for the first time! I'm so excited!
You came to Toronto and didn't say :(   Yeah, it's cool here, 'cept when the winters suck xD
Hannah your brows are on point girl
Wicked is good Hamilton is the best! Highly recommended
That Alice Underground theatre show sounds incredible! So sad I didn’t get a chance to take part!!
I think I'm going to have to buy Holly's book!
You're jumper looks so cosy... where's it from?
Have you found your perfect man yet?
I love The virgin suicides :)
I loved Holly's book! and those jewellery pieces look beautiful! :)
You have the best favourites videos
About a month ago I read the Manifesto on How to Be Interesting and loved it! It left me feeling personally affected. I didn't realise you knew Holly Bourne :) I'm happy now to have something to relate to!
thank you! ( your hair texture is first class, Hannah! you are looking Gorgeous, I like you very much, obviously!) thanks! good night! what's next? have a wonderful happy week ahead! thanks!
how come there's no motion blur in this video? my eyes feel warped
i read it only happens in the movies yesterday, it’s the first book i’ve read all the way through in about 3 years (i used to read all the time and went off it completely) it was so good, planning on reading the spinster club ones next
House of Cards is my favourite netflix series EVER! Wicked is also my favourite musical so i'm all over this favourites video :)
My September favourite was definitely meeting you and Lucy at Buffer Fest :)
Is it just me or does the video look slightly sped up?
Omg yes! Share that First Aid Kit love <3
Dear Hannah,\nI want to thank you for a lot of things but I think I'll tell you a story first, so here goes nothing: \nIt was 11:45 or something and we were sitting on the tables because it was breakfast break (we have that at my school). Everyone is really exited because Anderson asked Eva if she wanted to go to dance lessons for the 9th grade dance (we have that at our school too). There is a certain pressure in the room because              everyone is expecting other boys to ask other girls... who do I want to dance with me? I ask myself...without hesitating I already know: Andrew, with the ginger hair who sits behind me. Without thinking twice about it I ask him: are you going to dance lessons? No, I don't have anyone to go with and he turns around, almost in shame, because he can't  pluck up the courage to ask\nanyone. Do you want to dance with me? I ask and I see his face light up...I still don't know if in embarrassment or happiness. Yeah, I'd love to he says. Why? Don't you have a boyfriend? Because I like you...I  a friend way and he's not my boyfriend, he's my best friend plus he's too old for the dance, he'd have to be 4 years younger \n\nLater that day alot of my friends had been asked out to dance, but none of them had asked any boy. Who are you dancing with? They asked me. Andrew. oh, did he ask you? \nNo, I asked him *silence* \nThey didn't seem to get the idea that it was totally fine to ask a boy out! (Not even out, to dance lessons!!)\n\nBut sure enough the girls that weren't asked, asked the boys themselves the next day.\nHooray for empowering women! \n\nI'm telling you this because I think women like you Hannah, gave me the confidence to do my little act of rebellion against societies ideas. \n\nI probably git some stuff wrong and part of its cheesy but I hope I got out what I could. Thankyou Hannah:)
I went to see wicked the same night :) it was my second time and I'm still awed by it. I wish I could live somewhere nearer to London to be able to see more Musicals!
I was wondering why this video seemed hyperreal.  And it was in 1080p50.  That explains everything.
My boyfriend and I are watching House of Cards and we’ve just gotten into season 2 as well! Also, you’ve made me want to finally read The Virgin Suicides.
haha I think those intros are so cute :P
Tickets booked! A great 19th Birthday present to myself - I can't wait :D
So jelly! I've seen Wicked twice and it was my first theatre show that I saw live. I sat in the front row the first time and cried because of how excited I was. Needless to say, I love it. I would have loved to celebrate the 11th :)
I love your hair in this video! Cutie.
I once actually had to explain to a guy that the way men pursue women in movies is generally not a good idea in real life.  He thought that was actually how it's done.
Hey!\n\nI've just recently discovered your channel and i love it!\nthe  jewellery.... omg.. i want it. I hope i can find something similar here (i'm from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil).. i looove galaxy and space stuff.\n\nI really love wicked! wish i could have seen it many times as well.\n\nYou could have an amazing intro that is like you.. but you do not need it! seriously!
OMG House of Cards AND First Aid Kit being mentioned in the same video 😍😍😍 First Aid Kit are amazingggg live
Adore Wicked - I've seen it twice in London and I'm really tempted to see it again when the tour visits next year.  Will def be checking out Holly's new book!
That's me too! I feel like i need to get the souvenir programme everytime i watch a musical.... and then i don't actually know what to do with it....
You're videos seem to begin after the beginning. Like YouTube delays your video just a bit, but I can't tell how much\n Stop it or stop them. I want to see all of you and I mean that in every good way.
Where is the jumper you're wearing from? I love it!
The Big Sick made me cry too. Kumail Nanjiani who wrote it with his wife and stars in it is really talented and funny. You should follow him on twitter.
I've been enjoying starting university. So far it's just been a blur of lectures, training, eating and sleeping
Are you planning on seeing It? Or maybe you're not into the horror genre? I think it has a very beautiful cinematography and it was a very good movie, that's why I'm curious :)
The Virgin Suicides is SUCH a great book. I read it in one sitting while sitting on a bench in  park, and it was the most beautiful day.
oh my gooood I saw the big sick on it's release day it's one of my fav films it's so so so so good, glad you liked it too!!!
Yesss, first aid kit! The new single is amazing.
Pls don’t rip the page out of the programme, it makes me a little uncomfortable thinking about it 😩
I love watching these vids because some of these things I’ve heard of and some I haven’t, if I haven’t, then they become my favourites. Lol, plus I just love hannah❤️🙏🏼
i NEED to see Wicked again! i saw it a couple of years back and it was honestly incredible, so much better than i expected! love your vids Hannah!
I love Wicked so very much 💚
Was nice seeing you at Buffer Fest! :D
I think I will have ti buy Holly's book
You haven't seen IT
I know this is a weird video to comment on this but the quality of this vid is awesome! Like super HD
My friend read The Manifesto On How To Be Interesting by Holly, and then wrote a blog pretty much copying it? And I got so annoyed, like, I was all 'She's Hannah's friend you can't plagiarise her!'😂
Did you get a new camera? I can't really explain it, but you look more...real?
Ohh I went to an inmersive theatre experience as well, based on the works of Silvina Ocampo; in each room of the house you went inside a different story, but the actress was the same, it was really cool.\nAlso hey! You're looking different today (bangs are banging! Very cool), could it be because of beign back on the pill? And would you do a video updating hormone diaries with how you're doing? They were so interesting. If not, that's okay!
The only favourites series off YouTube I watch regularly. Keep on doing your thing, Hannah! x
I freaking love Wicked!! It's so good!!
Can you film a video where you show all the books on your bookshelf and mention a few of your faves and why. You have so many books I really want to hear some good recommendations.
i haven't watched the last season of house of cards just yet but holy fuck is that A Show™
Get one like the Drunk Advice intro!
I LOVE The Big Sick. One of the best pieces of film I've seen in awhile.
Oh the last 2 episodes of OITNB are in my opinion the best .. enjoy
Yes, I’ve seen Wicked 4 times now as well!
First Aid Kit, ahhhh ❤❤
Omg I loooove Holly Bourne
Good 🎥 film
Love this narcissist 💋💋🌷
Dannah
Show off TV
Your amazing hannah! Great vids
I LOVE WICKED
Omg yes love First Aid Kit!
Is the jumper Dodie yellow tho?
BYOI  it's audience participation Improv group,  renaissance  fairs,
You are gorgeous Hannah. :)
Hi
I. LOVE. WICKED.
Robin wright is my BAE!
I LOVE The Virgin Suicides movie. Would you say the book is worth it? I'm not sure if I should read it.
I love that your comments are about the structure or organisation of an event or show. The way your brain works is so cool and interesting!
I'm a gardener, we call it the change. Thank you your up beat and happy perspective.
The actos name from the big sick is Kumail Nanjiani and I highly recommend his stand up and maybe even more so his twitter. Seriously it's a treasure box! I love that guy. oh and while I'm at it, he's in the show silicon valley. Also amazing.
why is it in a higher frame rate this time? It looks odd to me
we have basically the same haircut ohmygod
I'm I the only one distressed by the disorganised bookshelf???  :P
What time-ish will the event with Holly finish? Just wondering so I can book my train!
The idea of someone ripping out pages of a theatre Programme pains me. Lol
Where did you go charity shopping in London? I've been so unlucky this season and I'm sure we're the same size 😣
Aaah I had no idea Holly Bourne was releasing another book, I need to get it asap!
Hopefully you'll do more twitch stuff in the future! Been loving that when you were on :D\n\nAlso this video is great! Love getting recommendations for things from your monthly fav's videos!
I love your type of videos!! You can really tell that you’re not a completely different person off camera! Will continue to watch your stuff! xx
I love your rainbow book stacks
Holly was literally in my school today
Literally just found your account I’m 16 and wondering where I’ve been under what rock to not find you you’re amazing omg ❤️
HOW MANY HOURS DO YOU HAVE PER DAY TO READ AND WATCH ALL OF IT AND LIVE
Omg my friend played Alice in that play! What a small world 🙊
Genuinely interested- if I now comment that The Big Sick is not a Judd Apatow movie, but was directed by  Michael Showalter and writen by Emily V. Gordon and Kumail Nanjiani (a.k.a. the leading actor and his wife), would that be considered a rude comment? I really want to know, because I am a big Kumail fan and am totally excited for the movie, and was just kind of sad to hear Hannah's mistake.
9:40 is it dodie yellow tho?

assless chaps. Jenna, you missed the opportunity!\nbtw I'm loving those shades. they look like Barbie sunglasses but for humans.
You should do one where you buy outfits for the Debbie machine!!!
his Shane impression is on point as fuck tho
Are there a lot of things more fun than watching these two people having fun with each other?
can we get a meme for Julien? like every time he gets really dramatic we call him Juliette
I swear, Julien needs to wear more denim and more plaid, he looks amazing in it!
That's literally the outfit my dad was wearing when we went to Disney land (?) in Paris :)
He looked good in everything
Hi just an old subscriber touching base. Idk how the youtube algorithm works but it sucks, cuz I haven't seen a video of your pop up for the last 2 years. Today I decided to randomly browse my subscriptions and saw your more recent videos pop up. Glad to see you and your videos are still entertaining as fuck, and hopefully now, youtube will put me back in the loop of people I used to really enjoy back in the day
Do a charcoal mask with Julien! this would be so funny!!
1:31 WHY DOES EVERYONE IGNORE THAT?!!
Jenna's look is giving me so much life. Early 2000s could neeveeerrrrr
Stop being Gorgeious Jenna, we all love you and Julien 2 he loves you. Ok/alright?
The Princess Peach painting in the back 😂
you got your step-grandparents BBQ AND a basketball game tomorrow?!?!?!?!?! YOU A BUSY LADY
Julien looks like every stereotypical Russian mafia guy that's ever been on tv
Honestly if julien doesn’t want the vineyard vines stuff I’d be willing to accept them
LIVING FOR THE LIL SEBASTIAN SHIRT LMAOOOO
Do the gf and bf swap outfits challenge :D
Anyone else legitimately clicked just to see how many boyfriends she had?
I LIVE FOR PARKS AND REC
She asked if he was ready for a third outfit, but it was he fourth no???
I might have lol'd more in this video than anything in a while
I had the exact same reaction as julien when you pulled out the lil Sebastian shirt!! RIP LIL SEBASTIAN I LOVE YOU!
Julien killing my ears about 108474792 times in this video with my earbuds in.
Check out this app 👉    https://sweatco.in/i/ajmason ... It pays for walking
7:38 he looks like Zach galifianakis in the hang over lmao
Julien is getting too good at the shane impression like it's actually scaring me
ok but like we need a hair tutorial
I had to rewind and watch that Shane impression several times... it's on point 😭
Can someone please tell me where she got her sunglasses!
Wait wouldn't that be the 4th outfit?
In the puma outfit he looked like a russian man who day drinks by train tracks and smashes chairs on his friends for fun
Julien: this is tight as fuuuuuuuuuuck. Jenna: shhhhhhhhh. idk why i thought that part was so hilarious
The dad outfit looks like a Walgreens worker I’m living
yo this video was actually hilarious like clam the fuck down you two :'D
HELLZ YEAHHHH!!! :) you two are the best! #CoupleGoals!!!! The Sebastian shirt is the best!!!
THAT IS THE BEST FUCKING LITTLE SEBASTIAN SHIRT ❤️😭
Ahh! The Panda meundies! I bought a matching set for me and my ex! ... Carry on.
We all know he got laid after the video
Wait...who is this D bag....You had a much cooler boy friend back in your Mass days...Really...this guy?  Eject, eject, eject already !!!
Before the video started I was saying AW HELL YEA, Then Jenna said AW HELL YEA
Jenna girl, you gotta learn when to use apostrophes. I was expecting more than one boyfriend in this video.
Where can I get the puma pants? Nice! Julien is rocking the looks!
jenna and julien have the most fun
When you gave him the camo I died the whole time he had the outfit on😂😂😂😂
13:30 Kermit in the background had me rolling.
Oh so that's where my credit card went  I'm cracking up 😂
phil has that lion shirt 😂😂
Hi Jenna, Julien and all dinks! My boyfriend and I love your videos and decided to make a cover of you guys' Otter Hand Dance as a 3 year anniversary thing. I know self promotions are kinda boring but it would mean so so so much to us if maybe Jenna, Julien or our fellow dinks could watch it!! The video is on my channel so everyone is welcome to give it a watch if you want ^-^ Ty so much!!
Omg I love the flannel and the jeans and the jacket I’d wear it
You and Julian should do a thrift store shopping Vlog and and then a haul, possible then make Pinterest diys with what you bought. Thumbs up so she can see this after her basketball game tomorrow!
No Julian that was not a pirouette.  Lol
Julien is just a better version of my dickhead cousin. He's all the good parts of my cousin without the douchebaggery.
J AND J LOOKIN LIKE A *_S N A C C_*
I like Jenna' sunglasses. Kermit was like you look good enough to eat.
Jenna and Julien should get married already.
I freaking laughed so hard! Honestly when she says This is my life I was like girl my husband does that to me...I know your pain. XDDD
Juliens Rawr 🐯 shirt is in Suicide Squad movie!!!! I knew it looked familiar!! When the guard is playing poker before Joker shows up!
I LOVE YOU JENNA!!!! keep up the good video's, and for another idea, do a bedtime thought's video:) Big fan:)
4:30 julian looks like a russian soundcloud rapper with his main girl
NEXT VIDEO; TRY TO FIND SOMETHING THAT JULIEN DOESN'T LOOK GOOD IN. IS IT POSSIBLE??
You should make a diss track on jacksfilms
THE BASKETBALL HOOP BASKET IN THE BACK
At 15:14 it literally kills me😂😂😂😂

HEY JENNA!! WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS??  A BLACK WOMANS POV!!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWGUIjterF4
I've watched Jenna for literally 6 years and I feel like I'm betraying her by being attracted to Julien\nI'm insanely happy for you Jenna and I'll love you forever but also low key jealous af
I love how you hype him up it’s so cute ❤️❤️

Hi guys!! Will be starting Accutane on Oct 12 (assuming all goes well with lab results on the 11th) and will be having the acne story video coming the following week! I'll be documenting each month on Accutane & filming update videos, etc. This video was pre-filmed, so I ended up being able to get about 2 months of Foundation Friday videos pre-filmed in time before starting Accutane- yay! xx
accutane fucked me up... but i never had acne again.
makeup is a fraud, if you cant feel comfortable in your own skin then wtf. Why ruin it with cover up... never understood it. So u got some pimples your not bad looking..... be yourself =)
The acne can't steal your beauty. You are very pretty!
She should wear primer all over her face if she’s trying to rid her acne!!!
I'm super happy that you're going to be able to improve your skin. Part of me is selfish and sad because you're one of the few YouTubers that have my skin tone and skin type. But overall I'm happy for you. And I hope I get to see you the next time you're in Spokane.
Bitches wanna pretend like life is harder as a woman while at the same time going from ugly as fuck to attractive by just painting over all the disgusting shit, then have the nerve to call guys without paint on their face ugly and act like men have life easier. Hilarious.
I bought this foundation last week and it has easily become my favorite drugstore foundation! I have combo, more on the flaky dry side, eczema and cystic acne prone skin. I set it with ELF's HD powder and that shit looks so good in pics and in person.
This is why you take her swimming on the first date
Taylor, I wish you the best with accutane. Personally, my acne came back after about 3 months being off of it, I've accepted that its my genes and well fuck it. But, Here with you every step of the way, it hopefully makes you acne free for life like some of the lucky people in the comments. From my 6 months of suffering in the Sahara I'd say stock up on the lip care, heavy-duty moisturizers, eye drops (dry eyes suck), drink even more water than you already do and up your fiber intake as well. For lip care, I swear only Vaseline worked for me. Also, stock up on the family and friends support, keep them close by. And one of the better side effects is that no more oily hair! Good luck, hoping for the best!!
Let's just use a paint brush
I've been watching your videos for about two years now and it's time. I have to ask because the cat-like part of my brain is withering into dust and about to float away forever unless I quench this curiosity ... what is a baeritto? Is it because burritos are bae? Is it that simple?
Have you ever thought about shaving off the peach fuzz you have? Or is that not a good idea with the acne? I have PCOS so I get facial hair and have to shave :(
Can you please do the dermacol make up tutorial (first impression ) please.\nhttp://www.dermacolcosmetics.com/produkt/dermacol-make-up-cover-make-up-cover-224/
I feel so bad!! Started this video and before I finished it and heard your opinion on the foundation, I went to the store and bought it while I was there 😪 hope it looks better on my skin 😭
Hey can you do a review or include Juice Beauty Phyto-Pigments flawless serum foundation into your next 15 days of foundation?! It's one of my favorite foundations and I think once you start accutane, you'll really like it! Love you girl and eat a burrito for me because I'm on a diet!❤️❤️
9:25 the guest star blue cooler makes an appearance.
I'd dick either way tbh
Thats probably why you get a lot of acne
doesn't the foundation make ance worse than it already is?
Raise your hand if you thumbs up before watching the review👍👍👍
Hated that foundation. Still have it somewhere but no it does the same thing around my nose and made my face look so bad about an hour after wearing it.
I'm just wondering bc I myself have really sensitive, oily skin but what's your everyday foundation? (that may be hard to answer bc you do so many foundation videos but I'm just wondering what your favorite is) but how do you know if a product doesn't agree w your skin since you try so many? do you ever try to look for non comedogenic products?
Yeeeeah trending! I bought the new shade for this foundation over a month ago and still haven't used it so I'm excited for you video! (I had the previous lightest shade and it was too dark☹️)
I took accurate! worked amazing good luck !!!
Found you on trending. You are so beautiful. I have never used Accutane, prolly should have. Lol I wish you the best of luck with it!
I have dry skin, but I look the same after a few hours, i haaaaate this stuff. I gave it away after two uses.
Does the sweet peach foundation break you out? I have noticed since I’ve been using it I’ve been breaking out a lot around my chin and I love the foundation 😢
I've been battling with cystic acne for over 10 years now.. It fluctuates in severity and some days are worse than others. Today I had a really bad day and it just makes me feel so ugly and disgusted of myself. I've been crying my eyes out over it for the past hour, so I decided the only thing to calm me down would be to watch some of your videos. Thank you for empowering women, especially those of us who can be hard on ourselves because of acne. I know you understand the struggle of having a bad day with skin, but you are truly a BEAUTIFUL soul. Thank you
You NEED to try the Giorgio Armani luminous silk while you are on accutane! It SAVED me while I was on it. I just got done 4 days ago. Good luck Taylor ❤️❤️
Would you like to see a movie with me?\n\nMmh? Oh that’s right. I’m on Youtube.
I'm so happy to see a beauty vlogger who I can relate with skin-wise :). Good luck with Accutane!
Green looks so pretty on you
I would like to see 00 a unmixed just by itself. Your blush on the left side of your face from where you sit your actual left side is quite a bit more than the right side of your face. I like that Milani Foundation I think that it would look very good on me I am a light blonde with pale skin and green eyes. Good luck with the Accutane!!
Yes! Now maybe I can wear the milani!
I used this new shade the other day. When I was done my makeup I thought it looked meh and I figured it would start to look worse throughout the day. I had to go to work right after so I couldn't change anything. Oddly enough it didn't look that much worse. So I'm on the fence about it. (Dry skin)
Ugh of course when I buy creamy vanilla 01 and it’s too dark
Hey Taylor! I’ve been on accutane and as long as your heavily moisturizing, foundation  was fine for me (: as well, it’s been almost 2 years off of accutane, and my skin is still so dry! Get ready haha
Will this shade finally be my pale princess shade?! I shall soon find out!! Lol. 😁💖
I’m so happy you’re on trending! Fav YouTuber!
Hey, fellow Baerritos, has anyone with dry skin tried this foundation?? Did your skin have the same breaking-down reaction as it did here? Thanks!
So dedicated! We all wish you the best on Accutane! Can’t wait to see your results💙
Hope the treatment works for your acne! If it doesn't however, don't sweat it because it's honetly not even THAT bad. I've seen soo much worse.
Have you tried the Too Faced Peach Perfect Comfort Matte Foundation
I hate that foundation👎🏻 It looks super cakey on me after a couple hours.
You call it foundation, I call it lies! Regardless, you're still gorgeous. Keep up the good work.
god i have not the best skin, but its still nice, and this foundation..... boy it looked so disgusting i have no idea how anyone could like it lmao
Hey babe, don't worry about posting for us while your skin is changing! 💜\nBest of luck with your new meds babe 💜
Don't stop eating toxic non organic death just cover it up with toxic non organic death
pimples yuck put egg whites pn face sit in front of a fan twenty minutes and you will feel the effects in two weeks your face will be clear and tight try it better than chemicals trust me whats a egg cost and it really works
I'm suuuper oily andI tried this foundation because Tati raves about it but Id had the exact outcome you had. Three or four hours in and I was lookin like a greasy mess.
So, I also just started Accutane! I've taken it before, but basically a second cycle needed to happen for me. I will say, the first time I was on it, I deffffffinitely experienced hella dryness all over, including my face. However, I don't think that I adapted my skincare to the type of stuff I was experiencing adequately at all, or at least I didn't do it fast enough. This time around, I like preemptively started using heavy-ass moisturizers and switching out certain products, and it's only been 5 days, but I have experienced minimal dryness/flakiness/all the gross stuff Accutane does to your face before it gets good. I can definitely tell I'm way dryer that normal (I'm usually pretty oily) because the heavy duty products don't make me heavy duty oily, but doing things this way means wearing makeup is 100% an option. I do hair and makeup for a living, so not wearing makeup sort of... can't be a thing for me. But skincare and skin prep make the Accutane thing very doable. Just thought I'd share what has worked for me. :)
I only clicked on this because of the thumbnail
You’re going to do so well on accutane! You’re definitely the best candidate. The symptoms suck but you will do so well!!
I hope the accutane is really good for you and works beautiful for you.  My son was super dry and had to use cerave moisturizer.
I looked like a grease ball when I wore it 😫👎👎
I'm not an expert on troublesome skin, but could the concealer be causing a reaction? I usually let my skin breath & wash with an oil based face wash when it's breaking out. Sounds counterproductive but it works
Good luck with Accutane. \nFor men it's easy. \nIt made me so sick I couldn't go back to school for months. \nYou have to take a pregnancy test every time. You cannot get pregnant while on it. If you do you will create a monster. I still have acne even now. I'm seeing a dermatologist...going good so far.
I use 00B and its perfect for me,  which is odd bc i have a cool undertone lol,  oh well,  not gonna complain now that i can finally have it!
Good luck with accutane! I wish I could go on it, but I can't afford to go to the dermatologist ( the last time I was able to afford it, the derm told me that I'd be a candidate assuming all the testing went well, since all the other medications never worked and my acne just got worse). I hope it does wonders for you beautiful :)
I love it with the coty airspun powder
Omg!!!!! girl you face fucked up like so at the end of the day i think gus got a much better face because we don't wear make up. lol  Yeah all them girl doing this shit better not get cocky. But i like your honesty awesome video I'll give it a like and also subscribe, all just because your honest i can't wait until the next video bye👌👍.
I used to have pretty bad acne like her when I was in middle school and some of high school. SO happy most of it went away and I didn't use no creams or wash or anything.
I bought this foundation last years because of how much hype it was getting, and I have NEVER been oilier than what I was with this foundation. Creased horribly, felt heavy, and looked like someone has slathered oil on my face. One of the worst foundation I've personally used.
Will your Instagram be real time? I'm very curious about acutane.
I wonder if any hollywood actresses use Accutane?😕😕😕😀😀😀😀
I appreciate the level of commitment and organization you have on your channel. You are so consistent!!
Has acne, continues eating junk food, wants to try a dangerous drug that is fatal instead of changing diet.what?
Why wear so much make-up? You girls still look beautiful without it :)
Bitch face look like peanut brittle! 😂😂😷😷
use minocycline...better than accutane
Please review:galaxy collection Fenty beauty
Accutain will change your life!
fuck Trump! amiright ladies??
我覺得 痤瘡不能化妝 因為對皮膚 恢復不好  建議樓主 先去治療
Trending!!!!! 👍🏼
Maybe you should stop putting shit on your face. It looks like a mine field. Please help yourself
This is why I have trust issues...
Got damn, you the reason we need to take these females swimming on the first date
Guys please don’t engage the trolls! Report them! Firing back only fules them.
Your face is done my god
All natural for me, not a single makeup product, ever on my face.  Thumbs up 👍
This girl needs help, stop pasting shit on your face so it can breathe... Wow wtf. You ever encounter an adult in your life that can explain hygiene?
Take her swimming on the first date.
Taking this bitch on a swim😆
You should stop wearing foundation.  Its really bad for your skin.
Girls that use as much makeup as you are real-life clickbait.
This is why you take a girl swimming on the first date
Yo your whole life is a lie bruh
This is why I have trust issues.
The thing you are putting on your skin to hide the redness, is actually causing it. Let your skin breathe... Eat healthy, be happy... That's the natural foundation.
Illusion 100
yous ugly af
What the fuk
Wow that acne is crazy
eww ur face is fucked.
Once she puts the make up on... her face looks like the back of a cookies and cream white milky Hershey bar... 😂
If only you paid as much attention to your acne as you do your makeup.\n\nI cut cornsyrup out of my diet and it helped a lot but once in a while I would have a flair up but I figured out that I was getting it from dairy products and I'm not lactose Intolerant I was just eating and drinking to much of it. Many people don't know this but its a major factor in cystic and normal acne.
Holy crap. This is how much change make up does to girls. Damn...
Ignore the head asses calling you fake for wearing makeup to cover your acne. It’s your fucking life, and you just showed the world ur bare skin on camera, not many ppl that have acne are comfortable doing that. People need to shut up w the “this is why i have trust issues 😂” do they really expect you to have perfectly clear skin under makeup? Are they stupid enough to believe u aren’t wearing any makeup in the beginning of the video ? Fuck men that think we want to do this to please them. The comment section is pissing me off lol
It's your big day! #NileWilson
Can you do a tour of your gym please
Been smashing your videos this weekend, great distraction from doing my work. Great work with your recovery. Can you answer a question for me? How wide do you have you Parallel Bars. I'm using paraletts and figure I should be setting to the same width.

So u gonna get bram to join your challenges some time?
You are so inspirational, I started watching you at the beginning of july and I got so motivated to stretch and work on my handsprings and tucks, and eating healthier and in a week I'm trying out for cheer team, wish me good luck, and keep up on the good work!
Wooooo go Niall ps I actually love your dad so much he’s hilarious
Props your edit became  way  better in last time how did  you do  that ?
anyone know how he did!??
What’s the intro song?
Nile, it is very interesting to watch you compete. You are very different during competitions. Quite intimidating to watch. I'm so used to seeing this sweet funny guy on YouTube and then during competitions, I watch you stare down the Pommel Horse like you're gonna murder it (who doesn't want to murder pommels tbh). Congrats on your sixth place finish in the AA. Incredible work!
Do you have any footage of what happen to the floor?
Congratulations Nile!! \n6th overall champion!! Well done. You must be chuffed with that. High bar routine was spot on! \nNever clicked on FIG Chanel and their gymnastic coverage so fast! \n\nI normally get excited following the worlds and any competition really, but since watching you on YouTube (for a very long time now), I feel I have got to know YOU so I got seriously behind you this year! \n\nCongrats again! \nMichelle (competitive gymnast)
Steven stands out so much, he was made to dance. It’s such a passion to him and it clearly shows. ❤️
The pianist's song choices are so delightful! I heard Abba, The Beach Boys and a swath of musicals in there, and I'm sure there were more. What a treat. 💛
Last year Zenaida Yanowsky's warm-up onesie was epic. So sad she's retired now.
thank you Lord for this treasure of pure #JOY
I never thought we'd get the whole lot!
Olga is my favorite teacher! Love that she is back.
At 5:04 is she pregnant? major props to her 👌👌🙌
Oh, and Fumi Kaneko looks stunning and incredibly elegant as always. I'm so glad she recovered from her injury!
A bit disappointed that we didn't get to watch Alex in class! I always love seeing him. But between Steven, Lau, and Ryo I was already torn for who to look at, so I suppose it was for the best, lol. I always find myself drawn to Steven in the end though, he really is incredible...
“Rocco’s MOM.”  She’s American!
Just started watching and had stop to comment on the dancers glorious leg warmers!
I couldn't watch the livestream yesterday as I was sitting through an exam and obviously I was quite disappointed. So thank you so much!
That girl at 57:55 who just skips off like NOPE, I don't know what's going on at all! is literally ME every single time we get to petit allegro in class. I love her reaction though.
I love Olga Evreinoff!!
I just adore Alexander Campbell!  He is both a magnificent dancer but also seems like a gentleman!
oh my god, mamma mia into rhapsody in blue. so perfect!
Smashing !! Thanks so much for this. Absolutely super. One for all lovers of Dance worldwide. Love it !!
Couldn't watch live so thank you very much for the upload.
I squealed when Alexander Campbell appeared.
Seeing Sarah lamb and Fumi great ballet dancers
At 1:09:45 the music is I could have danced all night from My Fair Lady. And at 1:10:55 My favourite things from The Sound of Music.
The class of Olga Evreinoff is very fun. But I am waiting for Brian Maloney's class. Can I see his class again? Is Brian a class teacher in World Ballet Day 2018?
ROH channel, thank you for uploading the whole thing! I never get to watch it live. This is my favorite stream from the World Ballet Day!
Does anybody else just LIVE for videos like this, because they can't take ballet themselves?
Royal Ballet,  Please tell me, I didn't see Yuhui Choi in this class. I know they can't have all the dancers in one class, but is she still with the Royal Ballet? She is my favourite dancer!
As good as calf rises are they should be doing it turned out , so they don't bulk up muscles that aren't needed when the legs are turned out.
I love this company and Olga's classes so much ❤
I so appreciate the pianist's inclusion of Monty Python's Lumberjack Song
Who's the guy in the black tights and white tank top that looks like it has bananas on it?? I'm really enjoying his dancing.
I always love the live stream on world ballet day! ❤️
Every year there's someone pregnant hahaha!
Can we take a minute and appreciate the pianist?? What an amazing job :) :)
I love how this year they keep the camera on the dancers so you can still follow along while they're commentating instead of going to the commentators and missing part of the warm up class.
There's something hypnotic about watching class.  Fumi looking drop dead gorgeous here.
Oh! I was so glad to see Nadia in the first class! If she is into her apprenticeship then I wish her the best of luck for a contract!
What’s the music for the dreamers ever leave you ??
Can anybody tell me what the song at 30:20 is?
Love the sound of music in there
Could I get any information about musics in this video?
I find ballet dancers fascinating because of their commitment to hard physical work coupled with their artistry.  I admire each dancer's accomplishment to get to this level.
I loved what O'Hare said - we can do more together to bring awareness to ballet as a vital art form than we can each standing alone. Collaboration among art companies in the US has always seemed too politicized to work, as each is trying to beat out each other for limited funding, etc. Everyone seems out for themselves a bit. Worldwide there seems to be a lot more opportunity to come together and be a stronger louder voice that's needed to keep critical arts like ballet alive and thriving as we are stronger together than apart. This is such a lovely experience every year, thanks to ROH and all the companies that share intimate coverage of their beautiful creations, dancers, and processes.
I love this so much. It is such an enjoyable thing to watch every year, I especially love watching the class
squealed when i saw vadim - love that guy!
1:02:22 is so me when i screw up and 1:02:50 is me when i think i'm at the club when i'm in class
Does osipova appear somewhere?
I just missed Natalia Osipova in class :(
O K..... Fernando Montano, I think.
Thank you for this video!!♡
What's the song at 1:30:00 ?
I have watched these every year and I have been anticipating this one. Amazing work! I hope I can get as good as them one day<3
They guy at 1:02:23 is literally me everyday 😂
Absolutely wonderful! Every year is better! Crazy music, fantastic: classic, jaz, pop (Abba's Mamma mia!). Love
I missed it that day😢😢😢
So glad to see Ms Pajdak this year, and other favorite familiar faces!
I’m so excited!!!
Love to see all the dancers.  They work so hard and create such beautiful art.  Grateful for their dedication.
Vadim😍. So, so elegant, even in class.
Olga's class! Love it!
Thank you ROH so much for giving us this wonderful treat every year! It's so special.
At 08:26 the music is I'm Sixteen going on seventeen from The Sound of Music
Sadly no Natalia Osipova, she's been with TRB since 2013 - never seen her dance live or in the cinema, boo hoo :-(
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS SO DESPERATELY!
The class and especially the Dreamers Ever Leave You rehearsal were my favorite parts in the whole day. Amazing!!!\nBravo to everyone!
Olga -amazing teacher
my legs hurt watching them lol
Только не прыгай, Вадик! XD  36:48
Ahhh <3 <3 <3. The pregnant ballerina is definitely goals!!! :D xxxx
Simplesmente maravilhoso !  Excelentes bailarinos e belíssimos coreógrafos.
Tchaikovsky pdd😍
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 amazing
J'aime !
Muntigirov! Love him
MY FAVORITE SEGMENT!!! XOXOX
Love it!!!
11:11 Is that the lovely and retired Viviana Durante taking class?!  How inspiring that she still takes.
I love how the pianist went from Là ci darem la mano (Mozart's Don Giovanni) to Wagner's Treulich geführt (Wedding march) What an irony.
38:11 Can you spot the overachiever? XD
The talent of the young dancers from the Royal Ballet School is amazing.
After the last year's disastrous presentation by Darcy, the World Ballet Day has become immensely enjoyable again. I love Kirsty and Alexander's supportive attitude towards their great colleagues.
Sae Maeda already stands out and she’s one of the newest. I knew she was going to be something when I saw her perform at Prix de Lausanne. Cannot wait to see her perform principal roles someday!
I love Olga ❤
Love this ! Delicious !
So glad it's up. I couldn't watch it entire live cause in my country it very late night...Actually I woke up next morning and they were still there.
Annoyed that I didn't get any notices that this was only on Facebook and not streamed on Youtube too. Not everybody likes fb or wants an fb.
1:16:15 'cause its just not World Ballet Day without Nela :)
do they dance at their own time..
during class, does anyone know who the girl right in front of the middle is? the one with the oversized white longsleeve and the black knitted legwarmers with white stripes?? she's incredibly good!!
She bores me, and I have had may more better teachers
when will this be deleted??
38:30 men's butt in tights...
Does anyone happen to know who the male dancer in the red shirt and white pants is? So sad Yuhui isn't in class this year but at least Steven McRae is!!
Who is the Asian male dancer in the black socks and green tights?!
Steven Mccrae😍 hope i spelled that right
EEEEEK!!!! Alexander has a hairy chest AND a nice ass!!! (jumping and screaming like a fangirl with panties falling on the floor).
Who is the male dancer rehearsing with Beatriz? I think he is fantastic !
I *do* love a brutha with an accent. ;-)
Such beautiful dancers Alex and Frankie ❤️
I'M SO EARLY!!!!!!!!!!!!
Talking about the rehearsal of the Caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland, the guy in purple (Fernando?) is definitely not as good as Eric Underwood in this role back in the original production. Maybe he's still young and has to learn but Eric's Caterpillar was just so much more sexy and fascinating and his movements much softer, bigger and more elegant and worm-like.
Chuff you Google for not adding a Headphone jack, dick move!!
I'm a long time iPhone user, but wondering to jump ship and try the Google Pixel 2XL - the main thing that holds me back is AirDrop on the Apple system. Is there a good substitute on Android?
Can you review the pixelbook?
Looks like note 8 was last flagship to have a headphone jack, they will prob get rid of it next year now smh
Now they can listen to all our convos, but that's a pretty cool feature to have 😂
everyone now talking about machine learning like they know what machine learning actually is.
If this phone had some of the features that Oxygen os has, though I know that they already have many of the same features, it'd be the perfect phone for me.
What an absolute load of BS, another reviewer that won't call this device shit for fear of not getting free stuff. It seems the tech companies can basically release anything and people will buy it regardless.
Did I just see Joshua from Android Authority :P
What would be the best phone to buy around $450
Just get a Note 8.  It is the best best phone bar none.
It would be cool if you could do another video about the best VR headsets.
Hey! This is a totally random question but I was wondering if the Apple AirPods will work with an iPhone 4? Thanks!
this guy flip flops more than a fish out of water.
Fuck!! No headphone jack kms not getting it
How is Google lens different than Google goggle? Wasn't that supposed to do the same thing?
You did not reply to my comment . Pls tell me what software u use for editing your videos
if apple doesn't give me an iPhone X as penalty for beginning shipping them on my birthday (nov. 3) i want to get the pixel 2 xl
Want the full review ASAP!
Google is way behind Apple and Samsung
Illmerica doesn't have any words in it??
It’s looks plastic phone .. no innovation on design nor on the software. Something I was expecting from google.  What’s the wow facts about this phone so that some one should ditch Other androids
Best explanation about what's weird about the screen setup. Congrats. That's exactly what I saw and couldn't explain.
If you drop your phone assistant will help
the white one with orange power button is the ugliest one its looks like glossy plastic and why should orange power button?
I get so excited every time I see someone reviewing the Pixel 2 XL.  I'm definitely trading in my piece of shit Galaxy S8 when I finally get it paid off for the 2 XL!
Hey! Which one should I buy, iPhone 8 plus or the Google pixel 2 XL? Please help!
Note 8 best phone of the year after seeing what Google pixel XL 2 offers
No,... Bezel has it own function , Thin Bezel give you more crappy user experience
Marques you're usually reasonable. How can you say that 849 is a fair price for an ip67 phone without a headphone jack.
You always trigger my Google when you say. OK Google
If companies keep removing the headphone jack I'll have no choice but to stick with older versions of phones. Guess they're not getting my money yearly anymore ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Soon as I heard no headphone jack I was out
Why Canadian guy(you know what I am talking about) early hands on and you couldn't?
Not interested in any phone without a headphone jack
Looks like one of those plastic kid phones
That front-facing camera photo was amazing.  Definitely tempting me away from my iPhone
850 is not the price I would pay... galaxy s8 is buy one get one free at T-mobile
Been a while since I have listened to Illmerica lol
Hey Marques just growing it out there MKBHD app anytime soon
Pixel 2XL doesn’t have a forehead... just sayin...
Regardless Marques is still gonna use this as his new daily.
It's not a pure Android experience with new skin. It has not one thing that is better than last year's other flagships. And now it costs more than an iPhone or galaxy. Made by Google products are all shit
hi.what you think is better.Lg v30 or pixel 2xl??????
U were so late for your spin class.
I dont get it. Why is everyone for bezel-les phones? Especially the side bezels are really usefull to hold your phone without touching the display by accident
Do a review on the Google pixel buds
I refused to support Google directly...

2iObySa91b0,Bad enough I have to have a YouTube account
Horrible that they removed HEADPHONE JACK!!!
All hail to samsung
maa ka bhosda hd.
Uglyer then iPhone 3g
No headphone jack? No expandable storage? And “microphones ALWAYS on listening!?” Wtf!? Uhh no thanks
please do a best bluethooth speakr
*Kinda blue*
no wireless charging, wtf google.
No headphone jack, huh... 😒
I. Need. This.
pass.
Dear Google just make software. Dear Samsung just make hardware
I hate it.
iPhones still better
looks awful
Damn, the design is just too much for me to overlook :(
You can Still use the headphone Jack via a dongle that is included so stop crying about it.
The problem I'm having with manufacturers taking out the headphone jack is that I want to use high impedance headphones. Instead of adding an internal dac they just get rid of it completely. Like why? I wanna listen to high fidelity music, not average to choppy Bluetooth audio
Pixel 2 is very expensive in india... High price
Which insider survey helped google to decide on that patch of colour above on the back?
design this, design that; it's a fucking touchscreen with a some bezels around. geeesh.  No one had a problem with bezels until the internet told them they did.  Everyone is gonna put a case on their phone, & what are you gonna grip on the sides of your non-bezel phones with cases on them
Plz give me any of your old phone
Pixel 2 XL best of the best!
- What's the color of your phone ?\n- Huh, don't you see it ? Kinda blue.\n- huh !
Good thing I'm over these trending expensive phones, right now for what the average user needs, a mid-tier $400 phone can serve him/her very well (and those do have headphone jacks)
Wow the front camera is awesome 😘😘
Can't wait to get my hands on the pixel 2xl. Panda! Panda! Panda!
Bezels are fine on the Pixel 2. Even on the iPhone X.\n- -\nSlim side bezels do not work well for people with big hands. Loads of unwanted touches from the palms. I downgraded from a Galaxy S7 edge to a Galaxy A9 Pro JUST to get a phone with some bezels (and some battery life, and a memory card option, and a Samsung sAMOLED 6in display).\n- -\nI guess it's personal preference. I can FINALLY hold a phone properly instead of pinching it from the sides to prevent unwanted touches. Yeah, that latter technique definitely resulted in some drops...
Why every phone manufacturer want to follow iphone by not including a headphone jack
Choice between Panda 🐼 and Matte Black is tough
It's a no for me.. price is ludacris.. not as cheap as we have known Google phones for in the past.
Does the Pixel support HDMI MHL? ie does it support wired video output?
Hello Marques, How do you balance the use of the two different ecosystems. I have an iPhone (IOS) for my social media and graphic design needs on one hand. I also use an Android device as well (Nextbit Robin) as an everyday phone. what do you recommend?
Am I the only one who legit thinks the Pixel 2 is gorgeous?
I don't mind the side bezels. \nJust wish the top and bottom bezels have the same width. \nYes I like simmetry  on a phone
I'll stick my black pixel...maybe the next upgrade will have halographics
Can you do a Pixel 1 vs Pixel 2 video?
220 more mAh is definitely an upgrade in my book.
youtube is pushing your video sincer you published this video. fuck google pixel!
The design is still ugly
This is an almost perfect phone. But the places were it does miss, it misses hard. First of all the bezels on the normal pixel (which is the only one I can afford) is HUGE. Feels like I'm using my old s3. Plus no headphone jack? Wtf? I'm with Android to avoid this crap! The lack of wireless charging is annoying plus it sucks that it's missing an sd card slot. The one thing I absolutely love about this phone though is the software. But that is to be expected since Google is primarily a software company. I'm gonna wait for the Pixel 3. Hopefully by then Google while finally learn the hardware side of things. But at least I'm with Android so if there's a phone I don't like I can just change lol.
iPhone killer
not as expected LMFAO
Ok No headphone jack.\n\n BUT USB powered Active Noise Canceling headphones are amazing..
Pre-downloded apps sucks ass.
What is POLED?
Google pixel 2 xl vs note 8
What phone r u using😒😒
What are bezels?
Pixel 2 gives me a 2005 vibe
ugly and still lacks in features. Some sucker will buy it.

Dislike. No finger lost. Arnold always loses his finger. This is fake Arnold. The real Arnodl would lost finger.
I have a question about that specific topic, maybe you can help - Thing is that the amps are the lethal part of electricity, right? Let's say that you are hit by a ridiculously large amount of voltage, but this voltage only comes with let's say 10 mA. What would this do to the body? The exact same thing as described, or would there still be other effects (more, or less compared to the lightning strike?)\n\nThanks in advance c:
Why was the title changed
Send him into a tornado
300,000 watts / 1000 watts per toaster = 300 toasters.  Not 10.  Unless those are 30kw toasters each.

What kind of a piece of garbage could give this a thumbs down? By far my favorite Country Artist and salt of the earth American Fans.  Trust in the fact that there will be a day of reckoning for Antifa, BLM, Deash (ISIS) and the Extreme left.  Until then our eyes on our maker and the Country that is the last bastion of freedom in the world. This Canadian Grieves for you all.

Country music gets too much hate!!
The people who were yelling and cheering and interrupting him are such insensitive dickheads. I don't even need to explain.
Very sad such a song would ever need to be written, thank you Eric Church (I'd never heard of you).  As horrific as the Vegas massacre is, and believe me I think it was horrific, remember that this song will strike a chord in the heart of nearly every active military, firefighter, EMT or Paramedic, Doctor, Nurse or Law Enforcement officer you've met or know.\n\nThank you sir for a respectful and apolitical tribute.  We all bleed red.  Peace.
I dont like country.  but when music comes from the heart..  just wow

Whats up guys it would be pretty cool if you can get me to 300 subscribers...ill make a diss track on the most hated person
When a cracker does something wrong, he was pushed to do it....if you're non white, no matter how innocent you are, you're in the wrong....
FBI created a Lee Harvey Oswald.
More people, the better.
What about the note found near the body - WTF is the media suppressing this information?  They keep saying no suicide note or anything - yet clearly there is a note on a table right near the body!
Why did he dicide to go and kill country folk?
Admiring the fact that it is fall and in Canada it's freezing but there you see he has his sleeves rolled up
Nigga was wall hacking too gawhdamn he doing it right
The thing that is scary is if you change the T in the reporters last name it’s Mat Gunman
pray for the shooter
were are the body cams of the SWAT TEAM when the breached the room???
I wonder if this happens in Denmark....
I don't understand why people want to hurt others life just because there not living an amazing life
My heart goes out to the shooter's family. They're the real victims in this shooting. If only the shooter had shot the fucking  redneck performer of the horrible music, I wouldn't have complained. It's funny how it's always white Americans that carry out innocent mass shootings.
Steve the shooter,  had 2 planes, I would like to see his flight records, flight paths, States and Countries he visited, petrol consumption, service maintenance recordes, who were his PASSENGERS ?? the passengers list. This would be in all aviation records. Perhaps he leased a plane overseas, this would be in global records, he would need to produce his licence, ID, PASSPORT, to lease any plane ABROAD, then there's the payment records to do all of the above, follow the money and his carbon footprint.
Media is either ignorant or complicit in the conspiracy. There were shots fired at the Belagio hotel over a mile away from Mandalay Bay. There were two people registered as being guests in that room !!!!!!
Cops told niggas to stay within the festival fences. Hm
Are semi-auto guns cheap? is that why so many people have them?
Um, why an hour later after the security guard notified police?
There goes all the fake ass Russian bots arguments that he targeted country music because he was leftwing.
Good on those cops love it
Go to: Movie BREACH - THAN YOU WILL UNDERSTAND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jesus is the second shooter !!!!  He shot himself to look like a victim ! And his buddy ran away
Is it necessary for George Stephanopoulos  to teach me how to subscribe on YouTube at the end of every single video?
shooter? i would call him a terrorist, oh wait, he's a white caucasian.
Thankful for all of the brave men and women who risked their lives and saved many. <3
An hour before they got to him!! Are you fucking kidding me!!!
this guy sure did his research.
Did he just say the correspondent's name is Matt Gunman?
False Flag does not mean nobody was hurt. False Flag means that the official narrative has nothing to do with the truth.
Inside Edition said he never checked into any. This all is insanely sad.
This is proof that Hillary was involved in the LV shootings, look at how poor of a turn out for her book sales.
Sense when did they start filming these tragedy's?
United States of Idiots! How's that second amendment bullshit working out for you? He had no criminal background but look he carried out a massacre!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLkruVqQLEM \nyou have to be REALLY, but REALLY stupid and retarded to think that there is only 1 weapon shooting at a time. 5:00
Now whitey knows how it feels to be shoot at for no apparent reason, like innocent Native Americans , Blacks and Mexicans have endured for many many moons!
Where is the hotel security camera footage?
HOW MANY TIMES IS THE AVERAGE DUMBED DOWN IDIOT AMERICAN GONNA FALL FOR THE SAME BULLSHIT TRICK. IF YOU BELIEVE THE OFFICIAL STORY YOU'RE NOT FIT TO WALK THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH
100 round clips? those are 30 round clips. Only way for 100 rounds is in a drum.
Or they had multiple hotels in his name because they were shooting out of all of them! Quit lying MEDIA!!!!!!
Chicago Illinois was next Google it,
2:02 Just in case we suck at math... and common sense...
I hope he rots in hell for all eternity.
People tend to a build a wall when they have their own issues.

alright so basically \nStephen Paddock wanted to kill himself, but since he was messed up he wantedto kill as amny people as posible with him\na clever plan. but not so clever if he kills himself
Wow ! Silly me!! I just got it !! It's like a dick extension having a gun and having a bigger gun is a bigger dildo!! It's only just occurred to me that this old dude probably can't get it up any more!! I mean look at all the younger spree shooters who did it because they couldn't get laid, well we know this dude had money and a girlfriend but he probably lost it cos he's now a limp dick!!\nYou see that is what you need to do now America, tell the truth about why a man would need a big gun , let alone 40 of them!! You need to let young kids know how deeply uncool it is to need a gun. What man needs a gun ? Over here in Blighty we would consider that being a pansy as tis old school to have a bloody fist fight and guess what? Nobody dies.
The sad thing is that these hotels have little to no security he could have done the same at any hotel bring all those weapons in ... also what did he have against country music instead of rappers? Hmmm....
There had to been two shooters. He couldn't have done it alone.
an hour later? Thought it was 10 minutes
Thank the lord he didn't shoot up the rap show....

Guns were placed previously in the room...the guy just walked in and got the keys at reception...inside job.
false flag perpetuated by the demonrat libtards to take away muh guns!
The conspiracy theorists are not the only ones u gotta watch out for now lol anyone can go nuts
Look for the photo released/leaked that show the dead lone wolf on the floor. \nThen take special note that there is a rifle on a bipod OVER his left leg. \nThey reported that he was killed on breech, then they said it was suicide, now they are back to killed on breech. \n\nLooking at his body position with the rifle over his left leg...... hmmmmmm>\n\nI hope you can find it, but the pic of his face shows he spit up a lot of blood, but you can see he was shot in the lower chest to stomach from the front. \n\nWith the rifles position and his final resting spot, that means he was shot by someone else standing in the room at the broken window. \nSWAT didn't enter the window and they did not have a sniper shooting into the room. \n\nFor all those who say the 4th floor muzzle flashes were the reflection of a strobe light, tell me how a moving cab wouldn't have fallen out of the reflective line of sight of that distant strobe reflection. \nNot to mention other camera angles showing the same muzzle flash. \n\nJust watch all the first shooting videos.....where the guy was still singing on stage. \nYou can hear shots and echo, but then you will hear overlapping fire. \n\nHead back to the pics in the room and look at the shot with his legs in the photo....top left of that photo is the window he was shooting from. \nThere aren't nearly enough empty casings on the ground for this to make since
He should've uploaded the videos to YouTube before he killed himself.
Who else flinched when they demonstrated the ak
WOW  Lone gunmen don't need several spots to shoot from,  Teams do.  Real deaths, real injuries, bad reporting.
What will be next step for USA government.
If we don't want this to happen anymore we shouldn't be creating more gun laws. We should just have metal detectors added to buildings. Going in and out. That way they can keep track of the firearms better. Concealed carry is ok. But you can't have someone stockpiling weapons in any building. If you bring a weapon in you can't bring another one in until your other one is out. Its called being smart and caring about what goes on.
Chicago people still being killed by gun men. No outrage there, the hypocrisy is real!
a sad moment in history
George Stephanopoulos is a little bitch, I remember he called this monster Mr Paddox fk him. Call him the killer or evil man, not mr you stupid ass news anchor. What a douche say what it is politically correct ass hole.

..Gathering people who wants to be a part of building a network of stable, fully self sustaining and self sufficient communities (a.k.a. life-boats for the coming social & environmental collapse).  Peaceful communities that are built upon foundation of : love, spirituality, mercy, generosity, tolerance, intelligent, and wisdom. If you are interested in becoming a part of this grass root efforts, I encourage your reply.\n\nThis Community ARK Project is looking for peaceful, patience, humble, and kind-hearted people who are awaken and aware of the coming social & environmental collapse; who want to roll up their sleeves and participate in preparatory efforts. One cannot pull someone out of a raging river standing on a muddy slippery slope. In order to pull someone out of the river, one must stand on a firm solid foundation. A fully self-sufficient community is that solid foundation, upon which we stand in order to rescue other less fortunate who will be affected by the collapsing environment.  If people are struggling to survive as the environment collapses, how can they help others?  People need fully self-sufficient communities to shelter and nourish them, in order for them to reach out and help others.\n\nWe are gathering people from all spectrum of professional background: engineers, scientists, architects, biologists, farmers, doctors, nurses, artists, etc. Both skilled and unskilled people. Those with knowledge will teach those who lack them. Those not in the know will listen and learn so they might in turn teach others in the community. We have spent 6 years researching technology that were designed to allow Mars colonies to thrive in a desolate environment. We are now planning on using those very same technology to prepare people for the coming environmental collapse. If you are interested in helping out, we could use the help to reach the ears of people who are awaken via social media, or you can read our blog titled Generalized Plan of Action for a list of positions you can volunteer for.\n\nWe are speaking to those of like mind who do not need convincing; in their hearts and in their thoughts, they recognize the catastrophe that lay ahead if our modern societies continue on their current path of promoting competition, strife, ignorance and scarcity. This Community ARK Project is lighting a beacon so that those with similar mind set will know that they are not alone in their thoughts and impulse; that there are others like them out there who desire to come together to pool our effort in order to extract ourselves and place ourselves on a different path.  One that promote cooperation, harmony, foresight, and a nurturing environment.
Notice the WHITE media keeps showing MANY pictures of the non-white Filipina who didn't even commit the crime, but the WHITE man who's the perpetuator has only 1-2 pictures, yes, mostly ONE picture of him with EYES CLOSED.\nNo doubt they are trying to WEAKEN the image of the WHITE barbaric man in the head of viewers. \nDirty white bastards strike again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The ignorance of the media regarding gun terminology is ridiculous. Sensationalized, uninformed garbage.
If it was not for that security guard (JESUS CAMPOS) the casualties would have been greater. The terrorist had to change his focus on the door and not the crowd. I truly believe the terrorist killed himself shortly after he shot at the security guard, believing the end was near. JESUS CAMPOS is a hero and should be recognized and rewarded for his efforts. He is a savior and truly earned his named that day.\n\nhttp://ussanews.com/News1/2017/10/05/hero-jesus-campos-mandalay-bay-unarmed-security-guard-who-got-shot-after-locating-stephen-paddock-before-cops-arrived/

Lydia, her nude lipstick, ponytail and that everlasting smile... always SLAYING..💋💋
Is your Peekaboo the mini size?
love Patricia bright!
Love that Balmain dress!
Lydia, feed Lunie on a flat plate or a wider bowl. She might not like her whiskers touching the bowl when she eats and that could be why she drags her food out to eat it. Cats are weird like that.
Lydia please please!! do makeup tutorial on the one you were with the Balmain dress, it looked stunning on you!! xx
Lydia you did not look bloated. If I'm bloated I look like 6 months pregnant 😂
kartal kalkar dal sarkar dal sarkar kartal kalkar

Hi Lydia! Love this video; as always :) and what a bummer. I was also so  excited for you to work with Brides because of how excited you are! Hope all is good between you both. 😘 😘
Loved this vlog so much Lydia, you looked stunning as usual and your lipstick shade was amazing!! I wish they could put that on sale xx
Love the make up look for the party. You look really pretty with ur hair tied up! X
What is u nice hair Colour called?
Wow, the Balmain show must have been a dream come true and it looked so extravagant and princess like. I am really sorry though about the Bride's Show. I know you have been looking forward to it. Stay positive, maybe an opportunity like that will come your way in the future!
Looooooool “hold on to ur butts” 😂😂😂
LOVED your outfit to Paris: roll neck & H&M satin shorts. Obsessed!!!! X
Go Lydia♣♣♣
You are sooo pretty Lydia 😍
12:19 Lydia looks exactly like faryal makhdoom Amir Khan the boxers wife
Love the vlogs. As horrible as it would be, I do wish that they would take you to the labs in China where they test the products on animals instead. Hopefully everyone would wake up and see how these companies profit from the torture of these innocent, scared animals 😢💔
Really bloated? Pleeease Lydia give us normal girls a chance eh?! 😂😂 \nGreat video! Xx

Patricia we love you😀❤
Lydia what photo camera do you use for taking pictures ?
Omg there was an Estonian model!!!!!! Im from estonia!!!!!! So proud of her, we actually danced together few years ago 🇪🇪🇪🇪
Your older videos.were more watchable.n entertaining. Now it's so much of needless talking . Why change the concept?
LOVE the first out. Simple, autumnal and your legs 👌
Your cat is just kneading :) they do it as that is what they would have done to their mum as a kitten!
I always wanted to make a lipstick! Lucky you!
I love that black dress, need it in my life, how tall are you and in wich size is it? :)
At the start of the video You did such an amazing job with your make up 😱❤️just loved it..
What is the lipstick youre wearing at the beginning? I need it
Ok but was the rubber duck actually chocolate????
So it's a chill one today, we're just heading to Paris that's it... 😂 who wants Lydia's life 🙋🏽
Love the ponytail look you've been rocking lately! Might you do a hair tutorial for it in the future? X
Cats do that paw thing because it reminds them of the womb. It's a comfort mechanism.  bless her!
I've been on maternity leave for the past two months and though I really loved watching your videos before they have become a nice break for me from mommy duties. I love what you do, you make my  day when I have me time.
loved the vlog such an amazing experience!! love Balmain
SWEETGREENS! I discovered them in the US and have been obsessed since. They need to open one in London. Like now. Literally the only thing I eat in America. #guacamolegreens\nAlso, you look gorgeous as usual. That dress is amazing on you.
That’s what cats do when they are happy and relaxed, it’s like the motion they made when they were kneading Their Mum while drinking milk as kittens.
Sorry, not a fan of those huge clear glasses....looks kinda odd ~_~
I loved ur video but lumi just makes its pop.  I just love her little self.  I have a kitty named Cali but she doesn't hardly talk.  Ever.  So my request is an entire video of a day with lumi.  It may be difficult with ur work and all but I know if anyone can do it, Lydia can.  Love u both.
the glow scrub must be new..it doesn't come up
Thank you for your wonderful vlogs! Would like to ask you a question. You and Ali are always traveling , going to parties, meeting different people. How have you solved the issue of jealousy?
So Happy that i found you on YouTube 🙏 love you Lydia 🎉
You are SO pretty😍
I love Patricia lol
You so beautiful, I like your dress.
Cats do the thing with their paws because it's what they do on their mother's breast when they are nursing and they never grow out of it. They do it when they are warm, relaxed, and feeling lovey :)
Hi Lydia\nThe watch you are wearing in this blog will you let me know what make and size it is thanks. Have to say you look fab .
Love all your outfits!! You look amazing 😍 xo, Daria
Omg I would love a lipstick made by you together with L'Oréal! It would probably be the best nude ever. ❤️☺️
the london transport is really bad
been really loving your make up lately xx
Your gratitude is what makes you one of the best YouTubers.
That mayberlline red lipstick looks beautiful on you
Oh wow, must show us your final product of your lipstick :) Lumi is so cute, must have missed you so much 🐱
Its so wonderful to see your success. You’ve worked so hard for these experiences!
no sorry to the ladie below but Lids i love ur over 40 min vids....keep them coming.... :)
Hey Lydia, I have been subscribed for a long time but in the last few weeks/ months I havent clicked on your videos as much mostly because they are always over half an hour long and to be honest while I love to see a vlog sometimes I do also like short snappy sit down videos. I do not have the time to watch 40 minutes of youtube and I dont wanna root through your vlog to find what you have bought or what you are wearing. I do understand that you want to share parts of your life with us but I'd much rather watch a series if they are as long as your video. I still admire your Style and your personality but I havent watched a full video of yours in 3 months which is why I have decided to unsubscribe. Just thought you may want some feedback. All the best to you <3
I absolutely loved that dark lipstick that you wore at your shoot! So beautiful
I'm waiting for the colder weather to come, so I can see your jumper dress outfits again!! My all time favorite AW clothing item, and you make it extra! I'm currently rewatcing some of your vlogmas 2016 videos just for that purpose.
when cats feel confident and secure they like to do that thing with their claws. By the way  i really love you and you are such an inspiration! Maybe you are comming to austria some day :)
Please do your evening makeup with charlotte eye palette
Wow, you look so beautiful! It seems your body is even more toned (not like lost weight, but more sports) and your cheekbones are chiseled and goddess-like! Really cool, so happy for you :)))
I LOVE when Lumi makes an appearance! 😻
I hope it will be cruelty free
Cats do that motion with their paws, because they feel safe and comfortable with you. Basically, it stems from how they would get milk from their mum as a kitten, so when they feel in that same safe way, they do it. It's super sweet, means she loves you lots :)
I can't understand the craze to wear clear glasses before I had my eyes lasered I detested my glasses and had it done purely for vanity sake. But then mine were really thick lenses. Love you Lydia and look forward to your vlogs so much 😘😘
You are one of my biggest inspirations and I have so much love and support for you. My only wish is that when you filming in a car please wear your seat belt. I know that your an adult and can make your own decisions and I hope you understand where I am coming from. I don´t want anything to happen to you or anybody else for that matter. We are so many people that look up to you so I hope you will take this in to consideration or not just film and show that in your videos if you decided to not be wearing a seat belt. Hope you have a wonderful day Lydia :)
Aww must have been a great honour for you <3\n\nhttp://carmelatte.co
Make up on point!
Yay! You've reached 500k+ subscribers Lydia!!! Been keeping an eye on the numbers!! Congratulations! You deserve it!! You are awesome!
I miss your sit down videos, still love your vlogs though ♥️
I would love to see the shade you created :) Love you!
That balmain dress looks like it was made for you, fab! Xxx
That Balmain black and gold metal dress is sick! Love it! The bag should be w one handle and it'd be perfect, methinks?
OMG PATRICIA AND LYDIA IN ONE VIDEO!!😍😍😍
Patricia is my fave glad they appeared together on this vid
Love seeing my two fav YouTubers: Lyd & Pat!!! You two need to get your butts together and create a bleamin video, seriously!!!!!!!😂
I wanted to see the lipstick!!! Please show us soon.
I was waiting for you to reach out and grab that white ruffle dress off her!  But you just sat there are dignified! (I agree you need to have it in your life!)  You really stole the show in that Balmain body con!  Truly stunning!  ; )
Lydia the last dress you were wearing compliments your eye color so well! You look gorgeous💕
You looked AMAZING in that Balmain dress!!!!! 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤 so sorry for that train delay nonsense!!! ☹️
I just noticed your at 500k+ subs! Great job! You deserve it and I'm glad other people are catching on! ;) ❤
Your videos are the brightness to my stressful days!! I love sitting down and relaxing while watching your videos! Love everything you do!
How exciting - making your own lipstick!  Good for you!  Lumi and or Cats in general do that when very young and nursing, that motion brings about milk from their Mothers. They say they continue when taken away from their mothers too early, but literally every cat I’ve ever had has done that, so who knows if that’s true.  I think it relaxes them and they do it when feeling content and cozy. 💄😽
If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all... Please please stop the negativity and borderline bullying about Lydia's glasses. Whether she needs prescription lenses or not, I can say from personal past experience its hurtful and annoying when people repeatedly  tell you that glasses don't suit your face or any other part of you they don't relate to.. For example, extremely curly unruly hair or extreme winged liner, Madonna's tooth gap, LAGERFELD's outfit etc..  Its not really ANY of your personal business is it?... Lydia is a human being with her own feelings and personal taste, she is not a puppet or Barbie doll to be dressed at the whim of the public. So please!! 🌹LIVE AND LET LIVE.\nBe kind.
Emily in the Video, can someone maybe tell me what's her channel? :)
That Balmain looks superb on you✨Lumy probably approves of that one over the DvF 🐈
Love everything bout Lydia’s style ❤️but that nude/blue/black/white dress... no no no. 😬
So glad you bought those dresses from the last vlog.  They look so good on you!

😂😂😂😂 So basically she said, Booby needs to handle his business correctly with our son, but other than that she doesn't give 2 squats about Booby and Brooke's alleged relationship.
I ❤️ Keyshia I think she really don’t care 😩
This is what happens when you date a BUM keyshia! Even though he had that NBA check his dumbass quit to be a rapper when he can't rap AT ALL. A lot of these athletes are VERY STUPID so once they run through their NBA money, they'll be on the streets after yours!
That man does not want full custody of your son keyshia, he's just trying to hurt you. Fight for your child.
Wait.....🤔 so if Brooke and boobie claim to have been friends since forever and be acting like they really good close friends keyshia never met her?😑 Exactly like I said before, I don't believe in the lahh drama especially HOLLYWOOD( this one)  plus this season everything seems so stage for ratings but I do believe in that Alexis drama tho she really trying make fetty wap BM mad😶
Catch the shade hunty!
Keyshia, you are beautiful, your highlight is perfect, but that hair. Girl, noooo.
I agree with Keyshia on the relationship with the child situation. If my child dont know you or not feel comfortable being around you. I wouldnt want that person around my kid.
Her hair is usually on point but THIS wig is a NOPE!
Keyshia leave this wig boo. Ugh
I'm not looking to buy RIGHT SIS TF
Damn!! Brooke a whole hoe how tf you just get out of a relationship ready to open your legs for the next
Issa NO for that wig. It looks like something from a 60's movie!!!
She need to throw that wig away looking like Frankie 😩
Her hair is killing me
This is a strong woman(Keyshia). All the stuff she been through and she still standing I don't care what no one say I'm a man myself and I feel that all women should be treated with the same respect as a man are better....
“Out of respect for keyshia.” Lol
Brooke how can u be booby bff and u never had a relationship as an Aunty figure to his child? Very odd.
They all look great today, especially Tamera, I'm loving her hair.
All the wigs in the world and this is one we pick
Her bangs are too low; you can hardly see her eyes. How does that not annoy her?!?
So we gonna ignore the wig
I don’t think she’s over Gibson 🤔
Hey, this gutter trash whore would be a perfect host for The Real! Watch your backs girls!
I have no respect for Brooke. She stay dealing with a married man!!
I love that she's coming out her shell more!
It's funny Boobi and Brooke felt the need to get closer on Love and HipHop. Sooo there wasn't an incline of sexual feelings between them before and during k and B's marriage?\nHhhmmm..ok....\n..random
whats going on with the hair keyisha
I clicked when I saw that wig! Damn that's horrible
Call me a heater but Keisha Cole's jet black hair is what made me not watch this video
Ikr keyisha u don't got one wit my child. So basically Brooke Whoooo #Ooooh lls
LOOKS SOOOOOOMUCH LIKE K. MICHELLE
I have a sister that looks like Keyshia!!
I love Keyshia but that hairstyle doesn't suit her well.
I didn't even recognize her
Keyshia, I love you. But you gotta fire your makeup artist and hair stylist. 🤦🏾‍♀️
Omg i so just thought this was k Mitchell smh
Who did her hair like that??
I love keyshia but this hair is not it. It looks dry and old
That wig or whatever on top of KCole Head looks crazy!
That damn wig make her look like she just turned 70
That man don't want full custody of that child he just wants to get at Keyshia to hurt her because he's hurt that she don't want his lying, cheating bum ass no more and she's over it. Keyshia not gone let him have full custody and take her child. That child is just $$$ signs to him. She's already being fair with him which some men don't even get, now he's being greedy. What a way to treat a woman after she let you live in her house when yo ass had nowhere to go and you cheated on her, but she still had heart enough to not want to see you on the street, and this how you repay her🤦🏾‍♀️. Karma is a bitch in the end.
wth is on her head?
She looks so much like K Michelle here
she regret putting him on the show Keisha Cole you a strong women
nah I can't..you seriously have to know who you're having a child with.
I luv u keyshia what's going on with the hair
What the bird nest is going on😂 lol
Did she get veneers ?
“No” lol
Keyshia is my girl crush. come to mama and dump these losers lol
She looks a bit like Cardi B here!
Keyshia Cole is so real, she needs her own show again.
they need to start posting full shows clips suck
I like Keyshia, but someone needs their a** whooped for putting that Elvira wig on her head. Most of the season, she's been giving me Morticia Addams teas. Wtf?!
That wig...ohhh god. Let's try again.
Love me some Miss Cole  <3♡♡
Keyshia girl. Why is your bang so thick? The whole wig overall really. It's swallowing your whole face. Can't barely see your eyes.
JUST DONT MAKE NO PLANS
That’s hair on Keisha 😮 um
I still laughing at Jeanies corny ass dancing when she comes out
That hair looks like it’s overwhelming her head but I agree with her on the custody thing. I’m shocked she’s being so damn mature about it, if only all parents were that way
I love keyshia but gurrrrl this wig😔😔😔 no ma'am
Her skin becomes so white 😐😐
So we not talking bout her hair !  Im getting distracted by it
Short and to the point
There's a person named boobie?!?! Omg 😂😂😂😭
How y'all manage to butcher her name when it's literally right in y'all face?  🤔
yes yes keyshia i knew my girl was coming back smarter and harder lol she got a man her self and he make big big Big checks no more tiny lol lol lol t.i you can have yo wife back I am with keyshia now lol lol
He basically already said he's not going for full custody. At least that's how I took it. And people need to stop worrying about his pockets. I really don't believe he would leave the NBA without having some type of guaranteed income. Him living with Keyshia on LHHH could just be a storyline as fake as that show is.
I love Keyshia Cole so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️
For one, who the heck is Boobie? And two, why is his name Boobie? 😂 😂
anyone who watches LHH is ratchet lol
Did Loni just say Brooke ValentiME? 😑
I agree with Keyshia Cole 100%
Those bangs ugh\nI cant see Keyshia's pretty face
Her hairstyle overshadowed her ☹️
Keisha’s hair...🤦🏾‍♀️
Keisha hair, ni hao kylan -ish
Keisha baby, who's your stylist?
Stupid wig!
Audience said NO
Keisha Cole yall!!!
love Keyshia
Keyshia hair is cute 1:12 ❤️ hair behind her ears 😍😍
Love lonis jet black hair 😍😋
Grown Woman response
Why she so pale?
Valentime Loni, Really?  I'll bet you celebrate Valentimes day also.
Boobie doesn't want full custody, he just wants that spousal support and if he gets custody it'll be ammunition. Smh, SAD.
Anybody else thought that gurl was momma mai at first? Maybe it was just me lol
That Wendy Williams wig is a no Keyshia...😐😒
That hair🤔😑
Why does Loni always say Valentimes?!
Keisha kole is really not as intelligently sophisticated in her communication as i thought. She sound like shes slow asf w a hidden clingy demeanor. # unmasked
+The Real Daytime come on now I don't even cable right now I have basic channels so I won't be able to watch the show on VH1 or in the daytime because I'm in school... and I was really looking forward to Girl Chat atleast... and this week we've only been getting one girl chat a day I atleast wanted two ?
Ewww  I can't stand this talentless bitch!
Hey guys! I'm a indie artist on the rise! Check out my cover of Keyshia Cole's Incapable & You on my page & follow me @iamdiijai
ABit K Michelle going on here do not like it \nI like style  on n K Michelle better
You guys need to bring relevant guests to the show
Film theory already covered this
Have you guys seen the theory that Anna actually does have magical powers, super strength, but their parents just passed it off as super clumsiness instead ?
I live in Phoenix, I'll take the ice powers and slash my summer electric bill.
I'd choose the ice powers. I don't tend to get injured, much, nor does anyone I have physical access to. I live in Australia, so the ability to summon cold to offset the horrible heat of summer would be great.
But if the flower from Moana is the golden flower, doesn't that defeat your Hercules theory? Polynesia is pretty far from Greece, you know?
Should we uhh use once upon a time into Disney theories...... Pronly not cause then everyone would we related XD (Henry's family tree thoooo)
I like the theory but what's going on with the editing?
I literally have 2 pet chickens named Anna and Elsa.
Film Theory already covered this theory a year ago\nSo, 2 theorists cannot make 2 separate theories about the same subject? That's suddenly an illegal thing to do?\nBecause if that were the case, theorizing has just become very boring.
Ice powers, hands down. I live in a warm area but I used to live in a cold area... I miss snow...
Are J and Ben twin? And which is older?
Have you watched once upon a time frozen arc where Elsa & Anna's mother is confirmed a princess of aredelle and had two older sisters. Ingrid the eldest was the crown princess by Elsa's mom trapped her in a vase because of her fear of her ice powers that accidentally killed their other sister.
Tarzan's parents were killed by a leopard, NOT a jaguar. I sort of see the connection for frozen and Tarzan, definitely see tangled and frozen, making Rapunzel and Tarzan cousins. Hard to wrap my brain around it
Ice powers no question. We have hospitals, and Elsa can create sentient beings out of ice.
Long Live King Ben!!
Wait...you guys...haven't covered this yet?
AYYYYY!!!!!! SUPER CARLIN BROTHERS SHOULD DO THE MINNIE AND DONALD BABY THEORY
Ice powers love this theory think it is true
They're European royalty. They're going to be cousins. Every Dynasty is related in some way.
Anna and Elsa CAN'T be related to Tarzan!!  They come from completely different time periods!  The Tarzan movie has black and white photos from cameras and metal ships powered by steam engines!!  Frozen has paintings and wooden ships.
REACT TO MY VIDEOS! Please?? I need more views to get known and I think you will like my songs!
Actually you would be prince ben
No, you wouldn't be just Ben, you would be prince Ben. The rules is't that you keep your title, it's that you get the title that's UNDER the one you marry. If there IS a king then he will be the leader but if there isn't a king then the queen will be in charge instead, and you can't just marry into being the leader of a country so if a man marries the queen he will become the closest he can get to a king, which is a prince... Sorry for the bad explanation lol...
has anyone seen the connection between the new TMNT and SRMTHFG? Namely, the genie episodes? would love to see someone else catch that theory with me! ;D
How did Voldemort get his little fetus body up until the end of Goblet of Fire? Did Wormtail steal an actual baby for Voldemort to inhabit? Or was the body something Voldemort could create himself?
Tarzan didnt adapt but got the abilities from his family like the others
Editing mistake in the beginning?
Just out of curiosity, do you think information (or at least some) from the Frozen Arc of Once Upon a Time could (or should) be used in a theory? Not counting the possibility of an even more expanded universe anyway. I /did/ hear that in the upcoming seventh season, Rapunzel (a new version of her) will be featured, and said season is intended to focus on more Disney versions of fairy tales (including Tiana and a new Alice Liddel). Waaaaay too complicated for a simple YouTube comment, but it could mean that Disney's version of Rapunzel could appear with a few alterations. And Frozen was already featured in season 4 and included an explanation for Elsa's powers. Other than that, practically no serious divergence from the original movie, which could work out in the favor of a potential theory.
I would choose Magic healing hair
Maybe the moms are twins
When you watch once upon a time so you can’t believe any of these theories because its different in Ouat 😂❤️
Not to be THAT person, but Tarzan's parents were killed by a leopard not a jaguar. Jaguars are from South America and Leopards are from Africa. Ok I will leave now..
Honestly if Disney doesn't confirm Elsa and Anna's cousin is Rapunzel, it's a misoppertunity  to make some HARDCORE CASH!
Is that why Tarzan can talk to animals besides gorillas?  He too has magic powers?\n\nAlso I've viewed them as representative of the seasons.  Anna spring, Elsa winter, Repunsal summer.  But the question is who gets autumn?  Maybe the person who represents death?  What Disney movie covers death..... hmm
There’s another theory that Elsa and rapunzel are sisters because they both have powers (ice and healing). I think the theory is that after one got kidnapped (rapunzel) their parents sent Elsa to live with the king and queen or arendele (who could be Elsa’s aunt and uncle or just friends of the king and queen of Corona)
But the Father's book on the ice magic and trolls is written in nordic runes.
Did anyone here someone laughing in the background at the end?
Ice powers duh, what use is magic hair?
didn't you guys already do this video?
How do you get ship wrecked off the coast of west/central Africa when your going from Norway to Germany?
why are we still talking about frozen, it was made in 2013.
I think that elsas poweres actually came from Idunas side of the family. I think that Agnar married Iduna because she possessed magical abilities from her ancestry, and that she was the only one who believed in magic, besides Arianna. I think it would make sense that since Elsa and Iduna share the same looks, maybe they'd share a magical abilities. Please do a theory about which side of the family it comes from
But i thought Olaf was related to Marshmellow?!?! aren't they brothers, since Elsa is their mom?? ;)
I think Elsa is Rapunzel  sister and Anna is there cousin and Anna's brother is Tarzan i saw a video on the Elsa and Anna not \n being sister
Film Theory made this theory a year ago
I was almost afraid that this video will just repeat everything i’ve seen online, but I knew the carlin brothers would come through with a fresh perspective!
Ice Powers. No one can take them and if you have magic hair people could cut it
This is just a theory, a Film Theory!!!.
Hey, I know that you guys don't do DreamWorks movies a lot, if any,  but I've always wondered why in the Bee Movie is Berry B. Benson the only bee with blue eyes? Personally I theorize that it's to emphasize how he is the only bee that is concerned beyond his hive, but I think you guys would come up with an even cooler theory. It's a question I just had and I thought to ask in the comments section because well I just started watching these videos and don't know how to ask in a private matter and stuff lol.
I just wanted to say that i love your videos! They are so thoughtout and amazing! Keep up the great work guys!

WHERES THE LOOT CRATES :(
Definitely magic hair

Definitely Ice Powers. I would be subzero, plus I could cut my hair whenever I want
You didn't do digging you just watched film Theory
You should have mentioned the fact that the 1st person to put thus idea out there is MatPat Game Theroy.
It’s been confirmed stop your life
I was SO pick the hair
What's with the random repeating parts??
In the song shiny Tamtoa said Diamond in the rough
Where’s the evidence? Like I don’t know maybe GENETICS go watch film theory’s video where they explain that they might be sibling \n\n\n\n\nNo offense through
Don't hate me for this, but you're kinda ripping off MatPat and Film Theory. I'M SORRY!!
Am I the only one that heard the this theory has been floating around the internet for a long time but it rests on the parents looking similar thing twice
I’ll always choose fire.
Do a video on how bad Elsa and Anna's parents are
Film theorist... They did this
Both
Wouldn't Ben be Prince Ben if he married Elsa? That's how it works in Sweden at least
Why am i here?
The film theorists have made a video about this! Look it up!
Ice powers! that would be awsome. plus I would not be cold in the winter :P
Film Theory already did this smh.
You guys should check out The Film Theorist. They have a theory like this. Y’all might like it.
I can't understand Frozen Theory
Nah, it’s just that Disney doesn’t really know how to draw original princesses
Tarzan is not related to Anna or Elsa because his parents are Irish immigrants  you can tell by the clothes. Also it happens before the industrial revolution with you see the Jane and her father have a type writer and arrive on a steam ship. So the time line makes no sense.
Ice powes

MOM Mission Mars mind-blowing exploration \nhttps://youtu.be/vh_dsQM7woo\n🌈🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🌈
So Repunzel is related to Anna and Elsa who are Tarzan sisters and unconfirmed part is the boat the parents were on is the one Arial explored.
Have you seen the theory that Elsa and Rapunzel are sisters and not Anna and Elsa? \n\nIt's a rabbit hole, but a FUN rabbit hole. It suggests that after rapunzel was kidnapped, the king and queen sent her twin sister away to live with her aunt and uncle. They feared she too would be kidnapped for her magical abilities.  So they sent her away to keep her safe and a secret.
How are Anna and Elsa  even sisters? One has powers, ICE POWERS, and the other had the powers of love <3
Hello random person scrolling through the comments! Have a great day!
Ayla is such a happy Bub😄
The same thing happened to me although I'm not overweight even after baby .. My family would call me fat. And after all the sleepless days or nights it could definitely be a damper on the spirits. Keep up mummy bubz u r doing so well! They really don know what they r saying. We r the best mums to our kids for giving them what we can
Can you make a “how to vlog“ video?
It's usually the older generations that do this too.\nMy mom is my worst reminder of all my insecurities cause she always says I'm fat even though I'm not and then I start believing her :C
Issac is super adorable. He's so grown up now!
Issac is one of the sweetest boys I have ever seen <3
Awwwww she's a chunky baby just like isaac was ❤️❤️❤️
the disconnect between the mentality of asian relatives who live in asia vs. your own upbringing as an asian in a western country will always exist. you just need to remember that in their culture, it's automatically assumed that every individual wants to be thin. they're not telling you you're chubby or fat because they don't love you, but rather it's because they care about you and are trying to be helpful in the way that they think they should be.\n\nwhich is totally not to invalidate anything you're feeling, because i've absolutely been there too. i gained about 15 pounds in the last year and a half and while i'm not fat, i look noticeably different to my family. when i'm just sitting there with my mom and my sister having unrelated conversations and my mom suddenly finds another way to bring up my weight and my out of control habits, it makes me feel like she can't even see her own daughter as anything but a measurement of fat. but you just have to keep doing what you're doing and let it roll off you, while reminding yourself that it's not a matter of love or not-love, but just difference.
Ayla is the cutest, just like her mom! Also, I have that same little portable fan. IT'S LIFE CHANGING. I like to use it in the morning to help facial mists or makeup sprays dry faster, too. xD
Bubz , You Are An Excellent Example Of A Lovely Human Being... ! 😊
You are perfect the way you are. I am sick of the world trying to make girls and women think they must be perfect based on social values.
I’m honestly surprised that so many people are commenting on your weight because you don’t even look like you’ve gained to me. I think you look great!
Isaac is such a polite and well mannered kid, well done to you both. I come from a Chinese family too, so I totally understand where you are coming from. I know I will never do it to my kids when they get older ❤️
Oh so Ayla has cradle cap. That's easy, coconut oil or baby oil will soften the skin then gently get a fine tooth comb and gently run it along the skin. I was able to get my son's cradle cap off that way. It's normal and common, and usually happens around newborn age to 1 years old
Hey bubz really my son is also 3 but he s not even interested in abc or ne learning thing it make me sad
I’m due my first baby any day now and I was at a wedding about 8 weeks ago. One of the grandmas looked at me when I was eating and said wow you still have a while to go yet and you are pretty big. I managed to laugh it off but I was not expecting comments like that! I’m a UK size 8 normally and I’m probably a UK size 12 now. I just keep thinking of how sore you must have been during the final weeks now I am there. You did amazing!
5:00 And this is how God came into play/ was invented :D lol
Hi Bubz-mommy ! im glad you all are ok there! i hope your little doggies are ok also! please tell us about them at next video! :)
Feel the same way with my 2 toddlers..😭
lol never miss an arm day😂😂😂
Hi bubz! Love your videos! You are doing so well only having a baby 2 months ago and looking after two kids! Don't worry about what people say, I cannot understand them, esp the women who probably have been through the same thing! My daughter is exactly 2 months older than Ayla and had the same white patch on her tongue, just gently brush with some cooled boiled water and toothbrush and it all went away! I read if you do not, then it can lead to thrush ... all the best :)
#1 - You are AMAZING! And you're so right, it took your body 9+ months to make that adorable little girl of yours and it's going to take time to heal.\n#2 - She could have cradle cap. My son had it. You just need to get a little brush and gently scrub her scalp with some soap and warm water. It will go away soon enough. \n😊💖
Isaac is such a sweetheart.
You look GORGEOUS bubz!! Dont worry about your body it created an amazing gift and blessed you with a healthy baby. It just needs time to recover
I love Isaac so much it hurts :(
Don't worry about Isaac, he will learn when he's ready. Kids develop at all different rates. I have a son just few months younger Isaac and I always kept stressing he doesn't know this or that. It's not worth it. He's a healthy, happy boy. That's all that matters.
Isaac is so sweet ^^
Congratulations with the birthdelivery of your daughter. What is she beautiful. Wish you alots joy & happiness♡
Try to wipe her tongue with glycerin it will get rid of all the residual milk
9:33 Don't hurt my mum. I'll cut you with my chin! D:<
I love you big much daddy😂❤️
I feel like Issac has grown up soo much in the past 6 months!
Hey Bubz! I just wanted to let you know that I know how you feel about weight insecurities - I'm not pregnant or have been pregnant, but I've also the same weight insecurity because of a medical condition, I've gained a lot of weight and it's hard to shed the weight because of this medical condition. Whenever I see family members, the first thing they tell me is: wah! time for you to go to the gym! or you shouldn't eat that, it's going to make you even fatter. And it's disheartening. I'm going back to my home country at the end of the year and I'm slightly dreading it, even though I'm actually looking forward to having fun.... I'm just worried about what people say :(
I am so so so so happy to see how much Isaac has progressed with his speech! He can make up sentences and talk so clearly now!
Darling you look amazing ... To tell you the truth, you look better than the petite size you was before your pregnancy. Yes some family / people are rude in personal comments towards people .. Try not let it get too Beautiful One 💛❤️💜💚
Im so tired of people bringing up peoples weight! Why is it so important for someone to be skinny or at least thinner? This woman has given birth to two beautiful children. She might not be at the weight where she wants to be, but she has gained weight because she had to eat for not just one but two humans. In which one was growing and had to be health. STOP NAGGING PREGNANT WOMEN ABOUT LOSING WEIGHT POST-PARTUM 😡
I'm Filipino, and everytime I see ny relatives, the aunts will comment on whether you gained or lost weight. They also ask about relationship status. Maybe that's an Asian thing? I just got used to it.
i see nothing wrong with your weight bubz.\nlove u
SHE LOOKS JUST LIKE ISAAC WHEN HE WAS A CUTIE MARSHMALLOW BABY
You are beautiful inside and out now you will have a personal message to teach your kids.
Have the moved back to Hong Kong ?
I just remember isaac face when he was the same age as ayla, I really miss it but I am grateful that isaac now has grow up healthly. You don't have to worry about what your relatives said , you are gorgeous just the way you are.Thank you bubz for sharing your happy moment with us
Family members can be so rude... it's like yes, they are family and they are some of the most important people in our lives, but to comment on your weight then you JUST had a baby is not ok! You brought two human beings into the world for crying out loud😂 and i'm honest when i say i barely see a difference in your weight, i have been following you for 8 years :) it's only natural to get a little bigger during pregnancy and as long as one eat healthy and get a little activity in during the day that baby weight will come right off in it's time😅
halo bubz, this is my first time leaving a comment for you since I have become your supporter for a long time:D\nBread actually is not suitable to be a breakfast for everyone.\nChildren often grow up eating bread will lead to lack of concentration because it does not have nutrients...
when are you gonna change the intro
One day I hope I get a response from you ☺ but you are such an inspiration and don't worry about what family members say as long as you are happy that's all that matters! 😊 you are like a sister I've never had haha and Isaac and Ayla are two adorable children ☺ 💕
I don’t know how I’m able to watch your vlogs in full and without stop/without feeling bored. I can’t watch ANY vlogs at all and I’m not exaggerating. To all the YouTubers I’ve subscribed to - I sub to some of their vlog channels but I never watch anything from there. But when I watched yours (due to your cute babies😍) I felt *comfortable*... if that makes sense. Your vlogs feel 10000% authentic and don’t feel exaggerated at all. Anyway I’m happy I subscribed!
Isaac is the cutest boy oh my gosh I cannot handle his little voice and he's so sweet! So smart! And he's just so cute, his little face is so cute!! Your baby girl is so squishy I just love your kids! You and Tim make such beautiful kids!!! :)
I plan on visiting HongKong, can u give me some advice ? Shopping places, food i must eat, stuff i must buy... thank u for ur help ! Love frm France
I just dislike how there so much negative connotation on gaining weight  in general and being fat, especially if it's just for friggin aesthetic reasons. Like chill. Say it if you are concerned about their health, but strictly only as a family member. Not to a friend or anything. Because as a family member, if it is about them not taking care of their health, you have that personal bond where you can show love and care and try to  ask reasons why. Obviously it's cause she got pregnant. But other people can gain weight form invisible or hard to see medical reasons such as clinical depression. It's so simple and clear. Don't make being fat or gaining weight a negative thing when it's based on aesthetics or reputation or standards or whatever. And this isn't a western view, it's backed by psychology and probably any sociology class. Also common sense kinda. Just cause it's part of a culture doesn't mean it's okay. such as in the US, rape culture has been long instilled in our society from systematic sexism, the patriarchy and toxic masculinity. I'm DEFINITELY NOT saying this fragment of Asian culture is horrible thing by comparing it to horrible rape culture in the US, I just honestly couldn't think of another example in the top of my head...I hope you understand  I'm not comparing the two. I am Just comparing the saying or excuse that it is part of a culture. Saying it's just part of a culture, does not mean it's right, cause not everything is healthy from cultures. I'm saying this also from the perspective of culture in Argentina (I'm half Argentine) where they also make comments bluntly and even have jokes and nicknames and tease you if you're a little overweight. (In Argentina having nicknames like gordita or gorigori meaning fat is light and fun to them but can be damaging over a period of time, and making comments is normal too from family members)
Yes I think Ayla is your mini-me and Isaac is Tim's mini-me! :D
Maybe the baby's mom is also 30 and she had taught him that phrase. So he's not a super baby, he just knew an appropriate phrase to use xD he's a genius baby if he knows his three\nTimes and ten times tables. It's not normal at 3 so don't worry about it.
Bubz u look greater than ever! And now u have two cutest babies!! You shouldn’t let anything bring you down!! Stay strong! 💕😘😘 sending love to u! 💕
Can we get a photo of bubz as a baby next to ayla :3
we love the bubz family! :-)
Isaac is so adorable.
does issac speak only English?
Daaaang!!!! She's gorgeous!!!!!!!
小公主好可愛呀！
Loved how she randomly spit on your hand
Your not fat because, that what happen when you give brith and it call beauty and plus you should said I also human begin too so sometime my body is not going to be like as you wanted my body to look afther getting brith because I also getting old so there no need to worry about my body no more because I already have someone who love me for who I am and how I look like and take care of my two kids. 😊😍😘 but it just depend on what you decide and choose so yea . 😊 and plus your baby is so cute when she yawn 😍😘.
LOVE your makeup whenever you're in Hong Kong! Looks so much fresh :D
so cute😍😍😍 I like the way you and Tim teach your children. Love care.
She is so cute!
Isaac is growing so fast 😭 what a cutie
She's such a happy baby I'm so in love
This kids make my day. SOO CUTE 😍😍
Bubz you look beautiful, and your babies look so happy.
My grandma used to tell everybody, including me: 'you're fat!' while she would take a big piece of your belly or your butt to prove her point. And she would say this as a compliment, very happy that at last the kids and teens in her family put some meat on their bones... We didn't like it at all, compliment or not. But she was adorable in everything else, so... We gave her that privilege of being our personal scale.
Isaac seems to be speaking more and more, and he is so polite! He really is getting cuter and cuter by the day <3
Just tell them sometimes that is the eye opening for them I know that horrible felling
People need to stop with how one looks because everyone is made in God's image and we should Embrace our Individuality! not compare,their opinion is their opinion and it's better if they just chill out
Ah I get it a lot too....the constant you're so fat! Lose some weight! I've honestly given up trying to say no, I'm healthy! It's quite bad as I am at the age when girls feel the most vulnerable to these comments and do extreme things to make themselves perfect. However, rather than feeling crappy about it, I use it to my advantage and make jokes about it. I've been hearing the comments over and over I basically immune to it 😄
ohh Lindy,  may I know your lipstick ? that you wore in the car.  it's look so nice on you :)
bubz: who's a pretty girl?\nayla: lol das me
i will never get tired of bubz putting lotion on her babies
How old Isaac is?
Hi Bubz, been a subbie for a long time but not been much of a commentor. However just wanted to say you are doing an amazing job! The fat shaming and image expectations of HK or the asian culture is ridiculous and I admire that you are trying to not let it get to you. I recently moved to HK and I have never been skinny, had fat comments made to me all the time, mostly from relatives or family friends. Coming here has showed me that even your boss or colleagues feel they are right to comment on your weight and how you should look. It got to me but we can only shrug it off cos we can never meet these so called expectations. We can be too skinny, too fat, too tall, too short! The list goes on!
You have a beautiful family bubz . Love ya 💕 I love when Isaac says hi mummy . So sweet 😭😍
I love when you show Ayla's facials. She looks so happy and relaxed 😊😊
Older family members are never held responsible for their hurtful words because others make excuses for them, such as, It's just a generation/culture thing!, or, They honestly feel like they are helping you. None of the hurtful comments will ever stop until you hold them accountable for it.
Hi Bubz, so glad you guys back to Hong Kong. I have been watched your videos for such a long time.But i was like the silent viewer ,quite shy to leave a comment.Your videos are so amazing and inspirational.It is trilled to see you guys vlogging, from seeing Tim's proposal until Ayla is born,. I really feel like being part of your family. I know Youtube has tons of youtubers but you guys are absolutely  be my favorite. I remember once you asked Tim what is the thing that he miss the most in HK, he said food!!!! Since I am currently working at yuen long ,i always looking for amazing dish for lunch , i would just killing me by not sharing the good food for you guys.Bubz i know you love dim sum you mentioned in the video back in Belfast said you didn't find a place in hk served good dim sum.I found a place call Big Belly at 教育路they did serve nice dim sum,you should try it!!!!!Anyway wish your family all the best ,healthy and happy ^^Have a nice time in Hong Kong .God bless your family .
all children develop different I wouldn't beat yourself up over lying about your sons age, I'm sure most mom's on here have told some porkies now and then. lol

you are really fat these days, bubz
I just realized that one day there will be no vlogs from the Ngs anymore. And this family will be vanished from my life. Unless the Kids continue this journey...\nKeep your fingers crossed for the future.\nI love you ❤
how come your kids are always sick? like isaac always has a fever or ayla's rash?
If you rinse out a clean wash cloth you can use it to gentle clean Lala's tongue just like teeth brushing to help with the white tongue. I used to do it once daily- gently because breast milk is so fatty :) is even do it to clean the sides of his cheeks, gum stimulation to help with milk teeth and the roof of he younger. You just gotta go slow as not to hit their gag reflex lol she's so cute!!
😢. Petty holds I special place in my heart. We played this song at my father's funeral. And you guys do beautiful work. Literally tearing up. Thanks for the cry..
Nice job guys....very tasteful....and on point

Yep
Здарова ёпта блэт
Are they hiring people? I could be those two on the right easily. Clap some random shit and get to be with WOTE in a video...!
Awesome Tribute.  1st concert I ever saw was Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, at Hec Edmundsen pavilion at UW. Saw him 3 times and loved every show. Would you consider covering Spike, off of Southern Accents, or pack up the plantation live version?  Love Your Music!
Verre niche
They should do a cover of Shut Up and Dance. Who agrees?
Lovely tribute to Tom
OMG!!! I LOOOOOVE THIS
Wow... I'm not into this music genre but I love the vibe you guys give off. The sound is smooth. Nice in general. 👍
Another amazing cover and big props to Tom's legacy!
Top downloaded WOTE on Google play (just downloaded it myself) Very cool all the proceeds going to the Heart and Stroke Foundation :D
I would pay good money to sit by the fire with these guys and just listen
When I saw this was a  Tommy Petty cover, I was upset. But after watching and listening I was smiling, singing and clapping😁 Amazing job and don't think Tom would have disagreed...how fun!
Stupendo 😍😍😍bacio hai cuccioli di casa da l'Italia
lost all respect for tom petty when he sued sam smith for royalties because tom was broke. stay with me doesn't have the same melodies or respective choruses as i won't back down. sad
Thankyou very much guy's. That was such a  beautiful rendition of the late Tom Petty's  song. Another Legend we all loved. RIP Tom Petty ❤ \nYou rock!
I'm not going to lie and say that I didn't tear up from trying to hold back emotions about this loss. You guys did a great job, I think it's truly good enough for tom
You guys are always so amazing.
this kind of looks like a bunch of camp counselors have abandoned all the children
Love this. Thanks Walk of the Earth It's a pleasure to see what you do with music and video and your generosity.
We love you guys!!!!! Amazing cover. Thanks.
Marshal looks like he would be very much at home on a tractor
Ohh damn. How much I've missed you guys.
amazing vibes and color tones, makes me wanna just sit with them and listen
hi. im one of your fans from indonesia. can i request for the next song Walk off the earth use Angklung or Kolintang. :)
Please don't ever stop doing this! You guys are too good :)
that was pretty amazing\nwell done!
What a great cover! Thank you, thank you, thank you, and thank you some more.
so well done!! Tom is smiling down! RIP Tom Petty
Lovely tribute to one of the best!  RIP Mr. Petty.
Big ups from Brazil! (y)
thank you for making this.
What a great tribute. Love it.
Very nice north of the border nod to one of our best rockers, Tom Petty......thanks M8 !  The cover version was nicely done.....classic WOTE cover artistry......nice to see it again.  Great vocals.  :)  nV
So much love in the song!
As always, this cover did not disappoint. My 4 year old can't get enough of you guys. He told us today that he has three favorite seasons... summer, fall and walk off the earth 😂 from the mouths of babes. #playburlingtonagain
Totally did it justice dudes and dudette. So great ❤️❤️❤️
Great tribute as far as I'm concerned.  Love the accordion.
can you guys do free falling?
You guys are amazing! Wonderful tribite to an amazing music icon!
If you've never seen the Postman with Kevin Costner.watch tom pettys eyes in the basket scene! That's living!!🖒🖒😉RIP
Tom petty was my friend when I really didn't have any , like many  I feel I have known  him for over thirty five years,have a bad day and put tom in it was hard to stay down, thank you for this
A wonderful tribute to a man that will be sorely missed thank you guys!🌱🌿🍀🌲🔥💨💨😀
Fantastic job guys!!!!!! I absolutely loved this, very harmonious! Put a smile on my face. You should do a little Stevie Nicks/Fleetwood Mac, y'all would be great at it after hearing this.
Thank you! Great tribute to Tom Petty, who we all will miss. You truly embrace us all with the spirit of music, in all you do. I am now going to go hug my husband, who turned me on to your videos several years ago, and I have to thank him, too! It's a family of the world thing. Then, on to your Patreon page!
Great tribute to Tom, great artist played by great artists!
That long haired guy is really good at the harmonica
Walk off the earth has done it again.....niiiice
If there was a way to commemorate him, well, i think yall did awesome job
I think this was really sweet of you guy's. I smoked my first joint to my Petty!!! :)
You guys absolutely rock please come to Australia!
Somebody either had a baby or lost a lot of weight suddenly... congrats!
Woow!!! I love it!! 😍😍 An awesome cover and great job!
Listening to this music make my pussy wet and I don't even have a pussy
Please cover something Just like this!!! From a brazzilian fan :D
I am so glad you did this cover. Thank you very very much!
Aight man, can someone tell me Gianni's guitar brand ? It sounds so good! Btw an awesome cover as always
I came late to an appreciation of Tom Petty.  Oddly, it was You Don't Know How It Feels that clued me in when I was still living in Toronto and it became my favorite Petty song.  Later I moved to Manhattan, ran a jam in Central Park for years, and went to a Tom Petty concert at Jones Beach outside fo NYC.\n\nGreat job; a very relaxed island-ish version of a great song!
So good, well done. RIP TP.  Sarah you look so good! 3 babies, one still so young, remarkable.
Guys I love you!!! <3 best band ever !!! greets from Chile!!
I loved this - thank you
RIP Tom. One of the greatest songwriters amidst a generation of the greatest songwriters.
Damn Daniel, WOTE back at it again with another awesome cover😂
Nice work as always, guys! What a beautiful way to pay homage to Tom Petty! ❤
I have come across and worked with a number of individuals who possessed true genius.  I have never encountered such collective brilliance as found withthis group. Absolutely wonderful.
Fuck dudes!... I just watched this on my 72 in, and damn!... gotta say I appreciate all the details you guys put into it. Looks beautiful and sounded beautiful. Fuck yeah guys!
Guys WHY did you remove LANYARD GUY from your videos list
Seriously, 170k views in a week? You guys are going global.
disappointed from the Germany part tho... so much material for this once
Once again you guys just make my day LOL
Just found you guys via Facebook (Ladbible), nice one. Keep it UP!
I love when you get political, it's brilliant :) also, kudos for all the great accent imitations!
Wow! I’m Chinese and I’ve been following you guys for a while :) you’re great!\nI also went to two of your shows in Edinburgh, both brilliant!
Which country does the guy at 1:50 represent? The one with the green thing on his shoulders?
YAYYY MULLINGAR , IM GONNA MAKE SURE I TALK TO YOU GUYS
I've waited a very long time to hear letterkenny
AT THE END YOU CAN TELL BUDDY ON LEFT DRINKS MORE BEER THAN TAKING ANYTIME TO BRUSH THE KNASHERS
I miss the good old days, when we still fought eachother. Nothing more nostalgic as that.
And while you invade Africa... I will invade Europe ;)
You guys are gas. Defo going to go see you live this year
*thick angry german accent I THINK I WILL INVADE POLAND
Spanish I'm going to invade India hahahahahaha
To your question Is there anyone who speaks Chinese watching this video? Yes there is! Am i getting hired or something?
“I thought we were playing monopoly”
The best video so far hahaha I hope to see the second part and a third and a.... you know
I'm not aware of that hahahaha.. subscribed
And while you are in Afrika, I wil invade Europe.  >:D
Oh shit you guys are in letterkenny awesome gonna take a trip up love your videos

The German guy doesn't play, it brings out the Wurst in him.
It brings out the wurst in me nice touch, guys, if I got it right
Oh i thought we're playing Monopoly :o Aren't we playing Monopoly??
When will you come tour in America???
Who's the guy in the orange?
I really enjoyed this sketch, please make no.2!
Can you please do a dentist check up video
Oh come on! You’ve been playing that for centuries😂😂
I love the subtitles when it came to China :D
Laughed so hard I scared the cat.
What country says im going to invade Africa first?
I thought this was all played by one person except for the India guy...
Nice subtitle text for Chinese readers when they say dui bu qi (I am sorry)!
Oh nein danke, I'm not playing. I get way too competetive. It brings out the worst in me.\n\nFuck man, that's so true.
It brings out the wurst in me lmao I can't even
This is so good haha
Gosh, no irish american slaggin? What going on?!?...hoping to see you on tour...just to see Arms really ;)
this is going to be another of those videos that I rewatch over and over again! :') Hope to have the chance to see you live!!
LuL nice Chinese sub. Can someone who can speak mandarin take a look at our script whilst the translator says sorry
I would see You Guys in Kilkenny
New favourite! You guys are da bomb.\nAll that originality! <3
So funny, can’t wait for next *turstdhhaaaaahhyy*
“ I’m not a Spanish, I AM A CATALAN ” as its a hot topic, nice
Hoho all the Irish people over here wopwop 🇨🇩👝🇩🇲🇪🇹🇨🇮🇧🇫🇧🇷🇧🇴🇧🇳🇨🇳🇨🇮🇬🇷🇸🇻🇬🇷😂
It is a long time since I laughed so much. Thank you.
those russian and german accents lol
I can't stop replaying this!😄💚😂💜☺💙 Which is annoying my cat. 😾
If anyone wanted to know the Chinese guy said dua buqi which means sorry.
Maybe the Best video of you guys :D and you already hat some pretty nice.
The new Monty Python but better and newer and with glitter!\n\nEDIT: I should add, that the comparison was based on the style of comedy. I'm fully aware, that they are not British!
LMAO, native Chinese speaker here. Let me know if you guys need help translating future vids.
This one's amazing lads!
Letterkenny!!!!
9gag
VERY FUCKING GOOD BEST IN A LONG TIME
Britain didnt invade all of ots colonies
What about mayo

Nice to see mesho again 2.
Did someone say ACCURATE?
You guys are hilarious!!
love the catalan joke
Great accents
Loved it 😀😂
sweet !!
Such clever comedy
Hahahaha 😂 😂
What troops?
Loved that guy's Russian accent! 😂
One of the best written ones yet.\nAlthough, the Russian guy does sound remarkably like Jose Mourinho
9gag brought me here. I've watched it 3 times already. Now I'm bored. It's been an hour.\nWell... here we go again
9GAG make me come here...
That Dutch accent was definitely something!
This was just hilarious !!! Well done boys 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Which are the last 3 countries that want to invade Africa?
how dare you leave Portugal out of this! :)
I'm a little bit English and I admit I laughed quite a bit at this. I thought you lads were English and just faking the Irish accent. Either way, as for the bants, it's fair to say we've had that coming for quite a while.
As an Englishman from the town of Hastings and with the 951st anniversary of the battle of 1066 looming, I think England needs to get back to what we've spent the best part of a 1000 years getting good at ... Pissing off the French!!!\n\nSo let's invade Calais, but only for a weekend booze cruise ...\nBecause, um yeah, apparently taking over other people's countries is a bad thing ...\nWoops, sorry! If only someone had told us that like a 1000 years ago - you know, the whole shit with Longshanks just nabbing Wales, Scotland and Ireland ... Yeah, sorry again!
We have a show in Cork :D *Is sold out* D:
When international relations gets too heated, send in the mammies!
I was hoping they would eventually convince germany to play along, and them totally losing control. Still had a great laugh as usual though!
this look turned out great i love this look!
My sister and I have it... fear of holes in clusters...

The palette is too expensive? What about the brushes? I am so glad I don't wear makeup haha. Brushes should never cost that much.
I love Dr Jart skincare, the bb creams are amazing! The jelly mask looks amazing, your skin looked insane xxx
Wow the amount of trolls on this post! Is this what trending videos drag in? If you’re new we’re not about that life here. I spray my troll be gone spray and I don’t see you anymore. Also the report button is a thing of beauty with those racist insults. My life!

Classic Chris Chan for the modern era. Absolutely fantastic
THE MAD WITCH OF THE TOY SWAMP CASTS A CURSE OPON YOU!
Why is Chris dressed up as a Witch?
This is it. Classic Chris is back. Claw of fail and all. God and the Bear have heard our prayers.
I wouldn't be surprised if he shat his pants again like did when sparing w/ Clyde Cash and Billy Mays on IRL. Dirty, Crapped, Briefs Part 2.
This does not even deserve a captains log introduction, *Takes glasses off* BECAUSE THIS IS DEAD SERIOUS
sometimes when I feel like a no hoper I remember that people like this exist somewhere
If there's one thing cartoons have taught me, it's that curses by crazy-sounding old women are serious business.
To think this was a guy.\nAnd autistic.\nMight be a good explanation for this... Video?
This is the Chris Chan we all know and-\n\nThis is the Chris Chan we all know!
Chris sounds like he's jizzing for simply stretching his arms out to the camera.
he literally looks like an old lady screaming
Is it a man or a woman? He or she sounds like this crazy lady from the westboro baptist church!
Bad acting Christine, not worth the oscar
I want normal Chris back.
y'know sometimes i genuinely feel bad for CWC\n(s)he just doesnt know what this looks like to everyone else\n\nlike, sometimes you have a daydream where you suddenly get everything you've ever wanted and never have to do anything ever again. i know i've done that -- like what if you rubbed a fuckin lamp, a genie came out and suddenly you just had everything? that'd be great.\n\nthe difference between CWC and us is that we snap out of it and realize it's a dream.
Seeing as I'm not superstitious or a total fool I'm not at all moved by your melodramatic attempt at cursing others.\n\nYou have to either be spectacularly naive or incredibly thick to think that such a childish display will put fear into anyone seeing as this sort of nonsense hasn't been in fashion since about 1400,
If I had 100 million dollars I would give Chris a million. But then again he would just spend it all on toys and mcdonalds in the first week and then ask for donations for a storage unit to put his new toys in and claim he needs even more money for food and Barb's atkins books.
What's with his eye?
Honestly, it seems as if Chris is the one getting the last laugh. People keep asking why he keeps feeding the trolls, but then again, trolls are the only form of social interaction he can achieve. The trolls are only giving him the attention he desires.
0:53\n\nChris Chan was Sofa King: confirmed.
I wonder if he realizes that this is all his fault this happened...probably not.
He was SOFA KING WRONG!!!!
I'm starting to think this guy might be retarded.
Sounds just like Sonny the Cocoa Puffs bird
I've been following this story everywheres, its amazing how far Chris is taking this.
I want to tell him to stay away from the internet, but its pretty clear he loves the abuse.
Give this it an award
When is the apology video for the curse coming do you think?
This just reminds me of Brian's mother in Life of Brian.
Look's like classic  Chris is back ROFL.
Well I have a feeling that the trolls are returning
This reminds me of that Monty Python sketch that takes place in Happy Valley. You sound just like King Otto playing the Hammond Organ.
You don't need her. You're the creator of Sonichu for crying out loud. Who did she think she was to boss you around?
Holy crap, I found a new video to terrify those kids for Halloween! Thanks for the wicked witch video, dude!
One of my dreams is to kick Chris Chan really hard in the nuts and see how he reacts.
Was that supposed to be his best Marlin Brando impression?
Ah Chris Chan. It's nice to know that you haven't changed.
10 out of 10 performance, Shaman Chris
This was disturbing to say the least.\nIs this the new Wizard Of Oz Movie? The portrayal of The Wicked Witch  is... interesting.
I'm tired of this
Reminds me of character from a Ralph Bakshi movie in this one.
You need to clean your room, young man!
This is the lowest I think we have seen Chris so far
This video is giving me brain damage. Make it stop.
which monty python sketch is this?
His voice is getting more shrilly each day.
Yes and the sagas goes on \n\nJust when you think its over too
That is a sad, pathetic display of an adult human.
That Curse-ye-hame-ha was so halfassed. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I expect more from you.
Was Christine helping that guy in Vegas?
You look like a witch
The next voice actor for Toad. \n\nYOU HACKED INTO THE PRINCESS' FACEBOOK ACCOUNT!! YOU REALLY BLEW IT THIS TIME, MARIOOOOOO!!! I'M THE BEST!!
You're not a woman. Grow up. Put on some pants. Cut that nasty hair. Get a job.
A Saga ends\nA Story begins
this is gold
IMMMMM MELLLLLTTTTTTIIIINNNNGGGGG
Get help
Hopefully you get an aneurysm soon .
0:55 He said 'Sofa King'.
only lasted 4 weeks
Aaand we have classic Chris Chan saga material.   Awesome
*high functioning autistic screeching*
Ya me yamma ha
It deeply disturbs me knowing what kind of extreme mental pain Chris Chan probably goes through on a daily basis.
Chris Chan season two confirmed
Chris....you need a kit-Kat
Am.....am I watching a pantomime??
lol what
Thats a very cute shirt tho.
KINO
That fake cry tho lol
rip
Stop
someone animate this
What happened exactly?
Sofa King Wrong.
Somebody burn that room
Clean your room
https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif
Eat aids.
Chris turned into Miss Piggy. :P
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
bruh
Here we fucking go again.
STANDING
haha
OMG I HAVE RETARDISM TOO
He has turned into sammyclassicsonicfan
Why won't someone kill this retard already?
PLEASE SEEK HELP. YOU'RE DESTROYING YOUR LIFE!
Try to curse me now Fatass X'D https://youtu.be/xRBbiivz0aY
SJW: The Poster Boy\nThis is why you all deserve to be gassed you creepy estro-pervs.
Chris seek medical help you might actually be having a stroke, at least get a professionals opinion
He looks like a swamp hag in this video.
I thought Chris Chan is in jail right now? Help me out, please... What did I miss.
Whats happening now? Can somebody fill me in?
it makes me borderline depressed to think i'd probably just take one for the team and take his virginity
What did he mean by this?
still has the same fucking music.
So much talk so little said. Unsubbed
fuck your sponsors go to a supermarket
Once again, SO GOOD
at 0:55 the caption says fifteen million merits, Season 3 Episode 6 but it is actually Season 1 Episode 2
Can anyone tell me which season the GOT spoilers are? I’m on 5.5
Here is the thing. \nI had never heard of Black Mirror until you posted this video. I clicked Watch Later and started watching them on Netflix. I just finished the last episode. \n1. I didnt want any spoilers \n2. Well there isnt a 2 other than to say there isnt a two\nI sure am glad i didnt watch this until after I was done!  Which ive seen every single one of your videos so I knew enough not to watch unit i was ready. \nGreat video btw. As always. \nAny more great shows i havent heard of you want to tell me about????  I am now kinda sad that i binged watched the fucking awesomeness that was BLACK MIRROR? I NEED MORE!!!!
What is the name of the song that comes on at 6:55???? It is the same song from the episode.. A Million Merits.. the theme... pleaseeeeeeee help.
Please do a video on A Ghost Story
0:56 Fifteen Million Merits is the second episode of the first series.
I couldn't get past the first episode, not my cup of tea
I thought the sponsored bit at the the end of the video was a lead up to something really dark and messy. It wasn't. And thereby totally ruining the actual message of the whole video.
Black Mirror is disgusting. A show entirely based on covering the deepest depravity of humanity. Shows like this should not exist.
I don't get why Black Mirror is so revered. I don't think it's clever. You know how each episode is going to end. Badly. You know your going to watch character A go through situation X, and the opposite of desrired outcome Z is going to happen and in the rare cases where Z does occur it never justifies X. There. Black Mirror explained in a word formula.
I love your videos man! Great work as well. Only this time I don't understand why you mention that Black Mirror doesn't evolve around the concept of Catharsis? I think it is fundamentally based on that concept as almost every hero of every episode is, in the end, subdued to the process of facing the consequences of it's own actions. With a tragic end in most cases as they couldn't avoid their fate, that they themselves created. Would love to understand more what you mean. Thanks!
well thanks. i will safely skip this show if i happen to stumble upon it. the idea of convening meaningless tragedies is not new. always wonder whether it's a good thing or not. never been my thing...\ni thought game of thrones was about families fighting? may have to skip it too
That's why I don't like the highly praised San Junipero, as much as it is a beautiful a story, it's the least Black mirrorish episode of the whole show.
Could you do one like this on Bojack Horseman?
I... Didn't... Know... That.... The dude from braking bad died.... Fucksakes
To me it seems that Black Mirror is all flash with no substance. The writers are very good at coming up with imaginative scenarios around technology and it's possibilities, but they all boil down to the same overused trope. It's lacking in the nuances and details that make a really exceptional show. I really think the draw of the show is less that it's genius, and more that it is avante garde. \n\nBasically, the draw of black mirror is the same as under age drinking. It's only fun because it feels rebellious.
Hey Nerdwriter, can I subtitle some of your videos into Turkish and post them ? credits to you of course
Oh, shut the fuck up.
Fuck. Being spoiled by this video is a Black Mirror episode itself. P.S. Blue Apron would be å great title for this.
PhillyD brought me here. GREAT VIDEO!! But where was the BB spoiler?
Black Mirror’s episodes don’t remind of tragedies like Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, or Antigone, but it very much reminds me of 1984. Those first three plays end with a closure and you feel the characters like Macbeth, the Capulets and Montagues, and Oedipus got what they deserved in some way. But in 1984 and Black Mirror there is no satisfaction and no one really gets what they deserve.
I'll get the family deal for one person
It deals with a lot of cruel and unusual punishment. Having one’s memory wipes every day and tortured for people’s entertainment? Indefinitely?? Forced to literally spend a million years in complete isolation with nothing? That was especially fucked up considering that he was a good guy and only did what he did because of impulsive, angry behavior. Also, what good does it do to punish someone’s copy for millennia when the organic version’s still locked up? What are they going to do to the original? Such technology could be used for so much good yet here it is used for ruthless torture and the enslavement of sentient intelligences. That’s why this is so dark.
can you next time speak on gameof thrones spoilers smh? please use a warning... not cool
I love your videos!
The episode with Domhnall Gleeson ended happily. She was able to put her feelings for him away like a box of keepsakes. She still loved him, her child as well, but they knew that the 'man' in the attic was an approximation.
Pleasure is not the only human motive
REVIEW BLADERUNNER 2049 PLEASE I LOVE YOU ABSOLUTELY
At 0:56, Fifteen Million Merits is credited as being the sixth episode in the third series; it's the second episode of the first series.\n\nI think it's telling that there were few, if any, clips from The Waldo Moment used.  To me that's the only bad episode of the series to date.
unrelated, but please do a video on BLADE RUNNER 2049... I just watched the movie and would love to hear your opinion on it.
Blue Apron is fucking bullshit. Just buy your groceries it's so much cheaper.
How can bb and got still be spoiled at this point.
I dont say thank you because, because of you a what all the black mirror, with, at the end, a bad taste... but it work
Black Mirror is not a tragedy, unless not getting what you want is tragic. It is about the darkest implications of technology, the limitations of using technology as a substitute for reality. Comparing it to Game of Thrones is just odd. Black Mirror is not about tragedy so much as it's about trying to overcome loss and the limitations, shortcomings and consequences. A better comparison would be that it's about the future after the downside has been revealed: Facebook, not when it was hey! I can stay in touch with all my friends, but Facebook with algorithms for advertising to antisemites, it's use by Russian intelligence to undermine American democracy. If I had to write a Black Mirror episode that was five minutes long: Someone finds the perfect mate using an advanced online dating app, they meet, everything is amazing, except one person likes Grand Theft Auto, the other person asks on the way to dinner, 'Can you wait while I run into the bank? then robs it, starts a shoot out and as police close in hops back into the car.
It wasn't to underage kids, that what the other guy did and Kenny was too shocked to disagree and clear it up before they fought to the death
Is this like Outer Limits?
Maybe now that you can cook you could stop using Blue Apron b/c that company creates so much waste.
My favourite episode of black mirror is the Christmas special season 2 because it makes you think the most about how blackmailing can be used for good but the consequences of it to
Black Mirror seems to me like a good example of cyberpunk, with the emphases on advancing technology and the resulting dystopian elements, especially in regards to economic class. However, I think the more plausible sub-genre of science fiction is a sub-genre known as post-cyberpunk, in which the sheer number of issues stay the same; some problems are solved with technology while new ones arise. This, I believe, is what we've seen with past advances in technology. For example, the development of antibiotics was a profound achievement in medicine, but it is also because of those antibiotics that we now worry about antibiotic-resistant bacteria. I did recall that the various iterations of Ghost in the Shell are an example of post-cyberpunk, especially the Stand-Alone Complex series. I think the sub-genre of post-cyberpunk has a lot of potential, perhaps even involving stories analogous to other sub-genres. Imagine, for example, a space opera, except instead of being set in space, it's set in a vast sea in the distant future, where the design elements of the sea-borne vessels and the marine life can often overlap...
I actually really regret watching black mirror, it just lingers as a dark spot i my mind. I think that if we want honesty, there is plenty to go around, but in entertainment this is just not for me at least. (Not meaning all honesty, but the total display of parade of tragedies) This does not make the show inherently bad, but I do think that for many people like myself, we just do not want or need to occupy our time with it. I don't find it challenging or developing in any way, it has just conjured grief and unease. \n\nI still loved your composition of the video, and I am a huge fan of your content. I just wanted to give you maybe a (less intellegent, less researched and shortly formulated) different view on it.
I personally watch it because it reflects our own society through a distorted lens (a black mirror, you could say)
We don't like hearing about tragedies in real life.\n\nYou know that's a lie. People get amped up. News outlets go crazy with all the sensation. It's a circus. People LOVE tragedy, it's just faux paus and socially damaging to admit it.\n\nYou don't admit it because being a personality is how you eat, and how people perceive you determines how well you eat.
I'm sure Nerdwriter is not unaware of the irony of the content of this video and the sponsor of the video. \n\nI hope people can learn to go to the market and find their own ingredients. Perhaps think for themselves.
thanks for spoiling Game of Thrones\n\n\n\nbitch
dope show
Breaking bad spoilers
Very disappointing analysis. It's like the guy didn't capture any of the ethical implications in any of the episodes within black mirror
the add at the end was disgusting. promoting something that produces so much garbage in form of plastic bags for produce that needs no wrapping makes me sick
Spoiler alert for the following: Season 3 Episode 1,3,&5, Season 1 Episode 3 of Black Mirror as well as Oedipus.  Hopefully you’ve read it by now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don’t think anyone is actually going to read this but if you would like an opposing viewpoint to this article, please continue. I’ll try to keep it brief, this is a youtube comment after all.\n\nSo I feel like you’re slightly off on your point. When you talk about Catharsis around the 1:10 mark you say that Black Mirror only has Catharsis when the characters in the story experience relief which happens in season 3 episode one and season 3 episode 6. If you look back at Oedipus for example you actually don’t have that experience, when Oedipus experiences his anagnorisis he has blinded himself and is banished from Thebes. My point is, to evoke Catharsis you don’t need a moment of relief or a happy ending, you need peripeteia where the protagonist’s fortune changes from good to bad and an anagnorisis where the protagonist has a shift from ignorance to knowledge, which Black Mirror has, for example the ending of “Shut up and Dance” when Kenny is caught by the police.\n\nAlso just to throw my hat into the ring about the meaning of Catharsis. If you take a look at Greek society when they embrace the idea of ideal forms. This part of Greek society did not believe in an afterlife so they believed the only way to achieve immortality was through being remembered which typically meant through wars. The idea of Catharsis was to purge emotions such as pity and fear from the audience so that they were not seen as weak and could become ideal men. \n\nAll of this being said I would assert that Black Mirror has a closer resemblance to the roman playwright Seneca as opposed to Aristotle. The first big difference between Seneca and Aristotle was that Seneca allowed violence to be displayed on stage. For example in his version of Oedipus when Jocasta realizes what has happened she rushes to the front of the stage, cuts open her uterus and bleeds out on stage as opposed to Aristotle having her hung off stage. As we have seen in several episodes throughout the series, they are not afraid of horrific displays of violence on screen, they even make reference to this in “Men Against Fire.” Seneca’s plays would also have moral harangue which is similar to season 3 episode 6 of Black Mirror where Bing gets his own show at the end of the episode where verbally assaults his audience about how they participate in the society they are all in. Also on an unrelated note, Seneca had a fascination with the super natural, much like Black Mirror's fascination with technological dystopias.
you should try the leftovers.\n\n\n\n\nso goddamn depressing..
Warning! Game of Thrones spoiler alert. Almost threw my phone at the wall when I saw it. I'm only on season 3 of G.O.T.
All people are asking for is a spoiler alert. No one is asking you to move a fucking mountain. Damnnit Evan. And I really liked you and your content but if this is how it's gonna be from now on, I will never watch a Nerd Writer vid ever. Unsubbed and disliked. Fucking asshole
Why would anyone wanna watch this?
This made me start watching it, and I love it soooo much ❤️ its awesome
How come you never made a video on Wild Tales (Relatos Salvajes)? Contrasting Black Mirror is a dark comedy delightful to watch
On the topic of television series you should definitely cover twin peaks
It's the kind of tragedy Dostoyevsky wrote - very human and very universal, while incredibly in tune with the darker potentialities of society and the world at the time of the writing. He predicted the terrors of Communism that befell Russia almost 30 years before Lenin with incredibly precision. \n\nWhat really screws with my mind about Black Mirror is that it is probably an accurate prediction of the future in certain aspects - and now things change much, much faster than in the late 19th century, so we can see the full-blown reality of some of the predictions the show makes extremely soon. \n\nIt taps into the depths of out psychology and I love it and fear its predictive power because of that.
its probably because its black
Can you PLEASE do a video on how women are portrayed and/or represented in movies? PLEASE
Why do we watch black mirror? Maybe it's not interested in catharsis. Sometimes there's this curiosity within us. To see these unseen tales. To experience this fresh dose of emotion maybe good or bad, Like to be carried on a Rollercoaster. Yes  we are prompted to think and recollect. But why do we watch black mirror... Sometimes it's that morbid curiosity we all have. Something I believe should be controlled. There's lot of good that some shows bring us but here in these tragedies if we just look for a story to tell at tables because its raw, its curious. Then that curiosity will lead you down the wrong road.
You think black mirror is just about entertainment through tragedy? Not mirroring our societal flaws? Human psychology that can be scary
that blue apron ad at the end was jarring as hell man. wtf
I hate black mirror! It's too too dark for me
Fifteen Million Merits was the second episode of the first season. You have it as the 6th in the 3rd
Book fans should be angry at how Robb Stark's story was in the show cause he never married for love in the book, he married for honor cause he was trying to be so much like his father to be honorable that it killed him
Idk how you guys see this as a spoiler for GoT. Everyone in that show dies anyways so it’s not that big of a spoiler
Make love to a pig? Dude, just say it. He had to fuck that pig. Don't say he made love to it. That's just weird.
I think this video approaches Black Mirror with the wrong paradigm, one of pleasure or aversion of it.\n\nI think Black Mirror is popular because it's a shining example of good science fiction: it makes you really think about the scenarios, their implications, their plausibility and their ethical aspects. It's a philosophically stimulating show, and that makes it an enjoyable show. There are very few like it, the original Star Trek being slightly similar although a lot more optimistic.
I do view it because of the morality of it all, though. It's a slice of life, and let's me see how the ethics of all the characters interact. I get to think of who was the most right or the least wrong. It's like Aesop's Fables, to a degree, only with a more general focus.
Fucking asshole. Who does that 🙄🖕🏾
FUCK YES, I love this show. Thank you for this.
This video only talks about what happens (Tragedy). Black Mirror is about how it happens.
what is your mate's name? Did you say Lasette?  I'm buggin out because my girlfriend's name is Lasett, sounds like its pronounced the same!
Fifteen Million merits, one of the greatest things written in decades. I love the fact when you start an eisode you dont know if it is going to be funny, happy, sad, set in the future, or the now. You dont even know a story. So few things are like that these days, most things you know at least somethign going in, so you prepare yourself for it, but not Black Mirror.
You should give a spoiler warning at first
Can you analyze Mr. Robot season 2 some time? It's one of the most psychological things I've ever seen and deeply felt
It's dark because it's a twisted reflection of us. I dunno, it's almost like a blackened mirror of a sort
Luther and shows like touchwood are much darker than blackmiroor in my opinion be cause blackmioror is a reboot of twilight zone it’s supposed to be creepy scary and thought provoking however it’s not truly as dark as other shows out there it’s more of a realistic take on how most humans would react in the instance of a bad event like the episode where the girl become a porn star to get out of her slave like lifestyle on a bicycle she isn’t evil she just gives in to temptation and who hasn’t done that this show is dark but their are darker shows out black mirror is creepy but it’s not a horror show
Man everyone makes these faces of tragedy (infinite reincarnations!)

What episode is 1:55 ? :)
SPOILER ALERT
Uh, GOT spoiler warning.
thanks nerdwriter for spoiling not 1 but 2 great shows, asshole
I thought this was about black mirrors........
DUDE! I was only on season 2 of GOT! SERIOUS SPOILER 3:34
I'm gonna pretend I just did not see that Breaking Bad spoiler.. I'm finishing Season 4 and I just don't know if to watch it anymore. Ugh. I came here to see a Black Mirror analysis not a spoiler thread.
Black mirror is a show for stoner millennials to make them think they're smart.
This is why we should be slow to judge others and ourselves.
Am I the only one here that actually prefers to be alone for an extended period of time?
I feel lonely and odd because I'm lonely and odd.
Because Jesus isn't in their heart without him you'll feel empty. Triggered comments put below👇👇👊
social media doesn’t help with this in modern times. we need to understand a lot of thoughts aren’t put into words, and everyone has felt negative emotions. you are not alone.
We might be in different struggles but for anyone going through this I know for damn sure you dont hate people and just want to do good and do good for others dont make life's mistakes fool you because those mistakes speak louder in your head than any other insult people would say . For anyone going through any kind of self destructive depression I have a clear goal for you be selfless , the more you do to help others, the more you set aside your trials and failures, the more you have room for memories and moments you will enjoy life
I like the love illustration. Who did it?
For me it doesn't help that my parents have told me when I overreact or don't react normal/properly to simple things such as when I feel annoyance or sadness or hate. I once became so upset with a person because they tricked the teachers, lied multiple times a day, and yet they were proud of this and others did not seem to think badly of them. My parents tried to come up with excuses for why this person might do those things but she herself had said she was lazy and had the time to do them on multiple occasions. I broke down into tears because I felt doubted by my family, angry at the girl, wrong and bad for feeling this way, and an extreme hatred that stemmed from my feelings toward myself and her. I can also suddenly hate a person I'm supposed to love for no reason I know of and I have an overwhelming urge to kill any living thing almost every day. My parents have also repeatedly told me that I was using the wrong tone of voice (I would sound annoyed or upset when I wasn't), I was blaming others (I would explain something and mention another person when I was only trying to say how something happened not that it was their fault), and that I am glaring at them (I will try not to cry or just be staring at them).
art? not so sure abut that. especially with it being so subjective.
1. There is an excellent video by the legendary psychologist Erich Fromm on youtube, where he says:\n\nThe most normal are the sickest, and the sick ones are the most healthy\n\n( Die Normalsten sind die kränkesten und die Kranken sind die gesündesten. )\n\nWhat he means is that people who show absolutely no symptoms of suffering, anxiety, or confusion are the ones who are most in  trouble. Because they are probably supressing everything, being totally alienated from themselves. \n\nBut those who worry, suffer and feel  tormented most of the time are indeed the healthy ones because these symptoms show that they are still  connected to their inner selves.\n\n Well, isn't that good news??\n\n2. Now, just as a thought experiment, take the person who seems to you to be the most different, the most distant person from you. If you think long enough about  him / her, you surely will find a trace of every aspect of his personality within yourself too. \n\nThe very same fear or insecurity may turn one person into a wiseman and the other into a tyrant...That's why our personalities seem so different at first sight. But when we label those who don't seem like us as  abnormal indeed we shy away from the task of searching for the same disturbing character features within ourselves.\n\nI would also like to recommend a great movie called  Normal. ( With an amazing Jessica Lange and Tom Wilkinson ) There you will find a man who seems  abnormal to everybody in his life including his wife and children!  Poor guy, what a hell that must be... But in the end you will see how much you have in common with him. \n\nThat's why I love the movies and literature... They open you the doors to the inner lives of people whom you could never truly get to know, even if they were your neighbours, your partner or your best friend...A great book or movie has the capacity to show you every aspect of a human being. In real life you only see that what the other person allows you to see, plus what your intuition adds to it. \n\n( You can at least watch the trailer of the movie on youtube. Just search  for:  Normal - Trailer Jessica Lange, Tom Wilkinson. The acting is really incredible!! )\n\n3.  The good thing about none of us  being normal, is that when just ONE person dares to open up, be vulberable and be himself, then it helps all the people around him to liberate themselves too. There is a really wonderful example of this on a RADIOLAB podcast called  The New Normal. It is the story of Stu Rasmusen, the first trangender mayor in the US. He managed to be the mayor of a very conservative small town and change everybody's perspective about what it means to be normal! \n\n\n4. And here is a remedy for all shy friends: \n\nYou can read Ryszard Kapuscinski's wonderful book  The Other . That can really  be a life changing experience for you. Because: what can help overcoming shyness more than realising that there is NO other?\nWe sometimes exaggerate our differences in order to  confirm our identity and feel ourselves more special. But we must indeed do the opposite: we must always deliberately look for what we have in common. It would be helpful to have these simple lines always in mind:\n\n You are human beings nonetheless.\n As far as one can see\n Of the same species as myself \n\n( Pozzo, in Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot )\n\nThanks a lot for this very consoling lesson and for the truly wonderful animation!
Reminds me of we judge others on their actions, and judge ourselves on our intentions
Uhhhhh I know I'm odd... I have sex with dogs... that's pretty disgusting in everyone else's view points... but I find that eating animals out of enjoyment is disgusting... I could never eat pork or pig... I do eat chicken but I always feel sad and guilty while eating it for needed nourishment to help my skin disease.. :(
I tend to not talk about some stuff like anime and video games (two things that are a big part of my life) with people I don't really know well just because there can be a negative connotation that comes with people who like that sort of thing. I've never been bullied or criticized for liking that stuff, in fact, all of my close friends are into at least one of those things. I'm just afraid of people thinking the wrong thing about me I guess.
Loneliness is that feeling to be stranger; the fact is that we're all strangers to each other. We live between two worlds; the inside and the outside, if you focus in the one of the inside, you'll fall in anxiety, depression and anguish and if you just focus in one of the outside you'll lose your confidence in yourself and you fall in the same illness. The other is a book, be courageous and go to the library and chose a book. Open it and start reading. We're all strangers.
This is, as often, an excellent synopsis, but I wish it would elaborate on the point that deals with the expression of internal feelings in art and love a bit more in depth instead of cutting it short at this quite important intersection. I feel like it's all a dilemma - We eithe repress our feelings like everyone else, or we choose to display them more openly at the risk of becoming vulnerable in the presence of the people we thereby choose to trust. As an artist, I've also run into a third phenomenon - where I've personally become a screen for others to project their own feelings onto because they started to view me as deep and special because of the work I do while not at all making a connection to their own innermost stuffings. This inevitably resulted in repeated cases of very tiring groupiedom. I do feel producing artworks makes for exchange and connection with other artists, though, which is a wonderful byproduct of making art and, measured by the concept presented in this video, this would be the successful scenario of solving the asymmetry. Yet --- Is this one of those problems where you end up dissatisfied whichever option you choose? Because I don't feel like being an artist has helped me with feeling lonely and odd. Like, at all. Neither has love.
Such as amazing Channel. They  never teach this in school. And if so , it feels to technical (Lack of feeling and association. Like robots). \n\nThis channel deserves more subs like 7 billion!
Please translate it to Arabic
You have got a very limited set of topics for your videos. I feel like i've watched this one already five times. Also I wonder how lonley and odd you feel Alain de Botton, and weather talking about it over and over again helps you with it. Hearing about it over and over again sure doesn't help me a lot.
This describes me too  well
Really? But I use mINS reading and individualism. I simply don't care what people think and expose my true self as much as possible.
the sketch was kinda depressing :/
man, I don't know how you choose your topics, but please keep up what you're doing.\none of the best channels on youtube.
I have spent 5 years listening to the inner reality of women's lives. http://www.collectingconversations.com Our stories may differ but we are very similar.
Truly beautiful animations! I loved when the lead character turned off the light to reveal everyone else’s deep, neon mysteries.
Life every day is happy or sad thats your life you should choose to take one of this in your life be successful and dont forget me
Is it ok to think that we should act fake so we don't put others down or bore them? I feel like we are our own individuals and that we can choose how we want to feel, but a lot of people do not think that way and expect others to entertain them or serve their interest the way they want.
I feel lonely because I decided to ditch my toxic friends and ex-partner. Now I'm too busy turning my life around studying uni via correspondence in the small rural town I live in to make friends with people I have nothing in common with. So for now, until I meet other people passionate about Science, I am lonely.
Moral of the video. Don’t care what people think because we all go through the same inner battle we try to fight
Well shit... looks like one of those solutions is hopeless for me... -_-
It's hard to make new friends when you have none because you forgot how.
Hi School of Life. Can you write an essay regarding gratification excesses found mostly on social media usage? And idenitfy newly adoptive practices of communication influenced by rapid tech advancements? Since you emphasize that well being is so important, I believe you ahould begin to study this behaviours.\nP.S Your videos always help me understand human weirdness. This is a positive thing, haha.
i’m so in love with this art
YES! I relate so much! Thanks SOL!!
I feel lonely because I lost all my friends when they left to different colleges.
This explains why I'm honest and blunt with my character.\nMy character helps people be more comfortable being themselves around me.
This video gives points that are completely subjective. How does this shit get on trending? Who did you pay?
I deeply and truly appreciate these videos and this narrator's work.
Can you do a Literature episode about Balzac?
I don't agree with this silly generational we are all ultimately the same, share the same experiences, the same thoughts and feelings. I talk to people lots and meet very few who have same or similar thoughts, feeling and experiences as me.
worship 1 GOD, \nVerily only with the remembrance of god do hearts find peace-Quran
ive learned i enjoy life a hell of a lot more on my own.  im happy being lonely!!
What a coincidence. I just watched a video from SciShow Psych on a very similar feeling. They called it imposter syndrome. It's a feeling of inadequacy in successful people and thinking their success was only based on luck and that other people deserve more admiration than they do. I think you mentioned it at one point in the video.
Birth we come alone. Death we leave alone.
I AM NOT LONELY! I FEEL SO ATTACKED BY THIS
Another pretentious video. We feel odd because life is fucking strange it's that simple.
Because we have no God.
I will have to rewatch that several times to really get the idea behind this animation. For now I can tell, these are some beautiful illustrations!
I feel like you guys are rehashing your old stuff
no because of society
because we are odd and alone
This is so accurately and beautifully expressed
Hello friends, have a great day, love you
This is why reading introspective literature is so important! This is reading Kafka, ladies and gentleman! Then you can easily imagine what others in you life are going through and how they are in the inside, which is very much like yourself, which is very comforting.
Just told somebody how I'm still struggling with feeling lonely where I live and this video awaits me in my sub box. Impeccable timing once again.
That was some trumpy handshake right there...
So the person with a Macbook that's got Harry Potter stickers on it who's wearing a Normal People Scare Me shirt and whose hobbies are Netflix, food, and sleep is secretly quirky and different in the inside? I doubt it. People vary in terms of their tolerance/appreciation for strangeness.
You've got to love psychology. It opens a window to the things we can't understand about ourselves and it also let's us in on the minds of people around us. \n...Very enlightening.
*Is life repetitive?*\n\n\nIs life a pattern?\n\nPattern of lies no matter how you try to prove it’s not..?\n\nPatterns of *”types”* of people? Feelings? Thoughts? Expressions?\n\n\nAlways expected to be a “good” person? Someone *”special?” Or “unique?”*\n\nAlways expected to be “different” *simultaneously?*\n\n*Why?* \n\nsame thing, passed to another. And another... and another...\n\nDifferent people, different looks, same “usual” *life.*
Absolutely the best video you've made yet. This made so many thing click in my mind. Wow. Thank you.
Holy shit this just opened my mind
this video could've just been summed up with don't compare your behind the scenes with someone elses' highlight reel
Thanks School of Life, this video was timed well.
Tis is probably the best channel i found on YouTube. It truly speak loud and effectively .. thank you.
I enjoy my loneliness a lot, but at times I feel I want to be honest and truthful to someone. Art helped me get through accepting and understanding myself. But I do not feel the cycle would be complete until I find the love or someone I can confide in. It's tough, art just feels like a temporary place holder that is slowly losing its long-lasting effect
This was awesome. This is what I'm feeling today and then I saw this video and felt drawn to it. Such an answer that I needed in this moment. Thank you God and universe for pointing me to this.
Holy shit people feel this way..?\n\nYeah no way this is representational. Ugh. Pop-science.
Thank you everyone working at The School of Life. These videos touch me just about every time, and this was felt even more personal. I've been watching your videos for so long but have never contributed. I've got to buy some of your books, to support the group and to hopefully grow a little bit more as a person. Any recommendation for the first book of yours I should get?
I think this video depicts a realistic answer to why we are lonely. But we keep looking for solutions on how to stop being lonely. Loneliness is a human thing, it's what makes us distressed but yet creative at the same time. I say the only answer to get rid of loneliness, is to indulge quite intensely into it, instead of pushing it away. It will always be there somewhere deep inside of us, nothing, nor a human being will ever subsitute our empty hole. I want to talk about how capitalism makes us even more lonely but that needs another entire thread for that.
Eh, I don't get lonely. Myself as company is the best company.
This was a major problem for me...thanks for pointing this out!
AALIYAH MADE THIS FROM BEYOUND THE GRAVE........
you think youre cool i just watched this on mute so i could look at the pictures top that smh

As french people, this title does not mean anything... I guess you wanted to say Pourquoi nous nous sentons SEULS et étranges
Yeah this explains me
Socha
Just be symmetric ;P
1:06 *zip* good enough
I have nobody.
Jesus knows you completely and loves you unconditionally. Have a moment with Him and ask Him to live in your heart.
Dear School of Life,\nPlease stop stalking your subscribers, you are always uploading videos exactly when we need it to the point where it gets a little eery.
No one likes me, especially in school. When I was doing math today,  we were told to check our work with others. I had no choice but to look around. Everyone had a partner but me, then I sat at my desk. I watched people that looked like they were heading towards me, but dodge me. Heading to the person behind me. at that point, I was in a disappointed state. I looked over my work, pretending to fix a big mistake I had made on my paper. But i had really made the big mistake of even thinking, someone cares about me.\n\nExcept for one girl, she has been talking to me since last year, filling me in on what I've missed on days I was absent. And talking to me about her day. I really appreciate what she is doing. I hope she won't stop, but my shyness may draw her away from me.. It really seeps through.\n\nWhat makes me sad, is that she has been the only one nice enough to talk to me, in 5 years. \n\nThat, is what I call, a miracle. \n\n\n\n😭
I guess I'm not as special as I thought. Might as well end it. 😔
To be fair,  people you know could also know you better than yourself.
I'm lonely cuz most people are retards.
1:05 When will tSoL stop the sex obsession?? That is literally pornography!!
Poor Kenan, looking short af
I love her accent 😍😍👌👌
Gal looks so tall on screen.
Sam Smith is such a cutie.
Omg I completely missed it and I put a reminder in my phone and everything
I keep hearing this theme song now. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNKA7OkpKtY
0:13 Gal raised her eyebrow is to die for.
People still watch this show? Really?! barf
I hope they do a Justice League sketch with Kenann as super dude from All That.
Gal is way better than Sam, whatchu talking about
Does anyone think kenan is funny
Sam is adorable
Sounded like Girl farted
Gal is so beautiful
Her smile just melts my heart ❤️😘
Omg Sam Smith😄😍 my hearts just melts everytime I see his beautiful face
Kenan: You're a natural beauty! You're almost wearing no make-up.\nGal: Thanks, Kenan! \nKenan: I was talking about Sam Smith...
Sam has one of the best voices ever. Sup dude. *fist bumps* i likr your music.\nAnyways..ha ha...\nI take the joke...ha ha ha...\nI'm a good sport.\n\n\n\n(Im a regular heterosexual non snowflake) Sam if you don't stop imma put your ass in purgatory for a week. 😂
I had the BIGGEST crush on Kenan growing up😊 he's still making me laugh!!!!😂❤💯
gal is the sexiest woman on the screen today. she has all the beauty and charm without the obnoxious attitude. don't let Hollywood ruin you girl!
Gal Gadot is gorgeous and beautiful lady she's a 10 😍😍😍😍😍😍
SNL is not funny. End of subject. Case closed. Anyone in the real comedy world knows this .Its equivalent to Community Theater
Did you know the Democratic Party was the founder of the KKK? \nThe MSM is hiding the truth from Americans! Liberals do not want you to see this video...\nhttps://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1419048691471316&id=127225910653607&refsrc=https%3A%2F%2Fm.facebook.com%2Fprageru%2Fvideos%2F1419048691471316%2F&_rdr
Who is she, never heard of her.
who is the guy on the left?
Man Kenan has been around for ages
So excited to hear Sam!
gal is pure and precious perfection
Its like she's not even trying
they are both so beautiful.

Gal Gadot where is her accent from
Sam lost weight. Good for him
That was NOT you
Kenan is the jewel of snl
So THAT is how you say her name.
I'm gay but when I look at her I have to admit no one's that gay when they see her.
I hope Alec Baldwin is their.
god bless you never said it was going to be a black person they are all black like this gal gadot and shit you keenan or kel have him bless me he aint retarded is he
I went to someone named sam smith in high school. He was pretty homo as well. Love this guys music
I'm REALLY hoping this episode doesn't suck. The potential from the language barrier is high, but at least Gal is game.
so you do pronounce the T.
Sam is such a cutie!
She said it twice, now shut up about the pronunciation.
Sam is such a cutie.
Can all the comments not be about how beautiful Gal is and be more about how funny and adorable Sam Smith is?
Sam is too cute for life.
Ahaha you're tall, love ping pong, black you know what that was not you. ahahah that delivery and timing, flawles, absolutely flawless Kenan :D
I want her to sit on my face 🙏😉
Gal 😍
Wife material.

Gal Gadot is all kinds of crazy gorgeous!
♡♡♡♡
Wow, Sam looks really fit now.
Loool Sams face when Kenan said black
Gal is simply lovely!
Ugh the dream team.
gun to my head, i'd smash
Two more days!! Wish it was sooner!
Sam Smith ? who's next John Jones or Bill Brown ? Gal Gadot is great, however..
I think its bs that SNL is still on tv
I like blacking up....!! it matches the rest of my part¿
Mazel tov
Mrs Gal is M.I.L.F
Sam getting skinny
She's unbelievable
Kenan, where's kel????
i love her
My wife Gal Gadot looks so beautiful!
Gal Gadot is literally glowing
oh boi, it's gonna suck
Gal Gadot, damn damn damn 🔥
Kennan is a squirter
*You were tall, love paintball, black... you know what that was not you*\nRight there I died 😂
If there is no Harvey Weinstein skit this week you guys are total cowards.
0:13 the one eyebrow lift. Everything this woman does is adorable.
I’d respect the shit out of her.
Looking at Sam Smith just makes me smile
That shirt Sam is rocking is nice as hell
LITERALLY MY MOM AND DAD I CANT WAIT
Free Palestine! Screw this Israeli ho👎
CHECK OUT MU CHANNEL
She's the perfect Wonder Woman. \nThe Muslims can hate all they want, \nbut her Israeli accent fits the character perfectly.
SNL: Show No Longer  funny.
Gal Gadot is a Zionist pig piece of shit.
Damn can't believe Gal Gadot actually sucked the dick of that Fast and Furious executive to get a part in the movie. \n\nI really fucking can't believe it. You always hear stories about Hollywood being a fuckfest, seems like it's true.
Wolf say she is hot in SNL
I want gal to rip my arms off and fuck me with it 😍👌
Funny.  Before BVS came out all you kept hearing about her was that she was too thin to play Wonder Woman and that her acting was wooden and stiff,  and Zack Snyder horribly miscast the role.  But, those of us who knew about her from the Fast and Furious movies, we knew what she could do.  Now that Wonder Woman has come out and everyone got to see what she can do, everyone is just head over heels for this lady.  I guess it's better late than never for everyone.
The dead horse is flogged to mush at this point
And it only took Capcom a year and a half to finally make me, a dirty filthy casual, to consider getting this. Just having Arcade mode does wonders, don't you think?
so the full game was supposed to be out in january we got half game so is this gonna be a content download cause i already have sfv
To all of you people saying it's free 😂 \n0:59
Okay guys im planning to double dip since I have not bought any season passes and only unlocked 3 characters thru FM and bought some dlc costumes too. So what I want is to buy this edition to get the characters. Do I get to retain my bought costumes and stages ?
This not gonna change the fact that you came out with a incomplete game still
game still SUCKS SACK ill go play usf4 on practice mode, so i can throw a fireball with my foot with ken
Maybe it will sneak to Xbox now
This mode shouldve been available in the game since day1, shoddy practice that hurt more sales because lets face it console gamers and some pc gamers dont care about online only play and go on forums and alot more say this release is too late theyve moved on from this game. Have to say capcom even with no xmen in the marvel game and no arcade mode it really does stink where midway is the better fan friendly fighting game company. MKX, MK9 and Injustice1 and 2 really are not bad games and I find to be really good
Congratulations, it only took almost TWO YEARS to give a game mode that MUST come from START and FREE in the launch game.\nThat's the new idea now ?? sell GAME MODES like DLC
Anyway since I already own the game but didn't get any DLC, i'll just sell my current copy and then get this edition to get it with the DLC.  At least that way i'll be spending $40 instead of $50 on DLC? Smh still kinda a loss though.
Shit Fighter got a bit better now , but it still a piece of shit. Took CrapCom all this time to have an Arcade mode which were suppose to come out upon game release , not DLC.
Man i need a strory mode between Ryu and Akuma!!\n2 V triggers \nNew stages\nNew characters\nBonus stages\nArcade mode\nExtra battle mode\nCAPCOM YOU ROCK!!
Now I have MORE of a reason to get Street Fighter V when I get a PS4 Pro.
Oh no Chun-Li showed her underwear. SFV Arcade Edition banned at ESPN now.
Finally over the years..arcade edittion now...take all my money alr!!!!
fuck you capcom for not giving so much importance to Ken when he's one of the best in All Street fighter series and most anticipated Character in online and on Pro tour Competition and winner plus Finalist,  they didn't even Put him on this trailer and gave him a shitty role in SFV's story mode when he deserves much better storyline along side Ryu and guile  *raises middle finger*
Put it on Switch and I’ll buy it.
This would've allowed the game to fully capitalize on the market, had it been available on release. While it will be a nice addition to the game, business wise, it may be a bit too late. Only us who already bought the game will benefit with the new v triggers and stuff.
Glad to see the game is finally leaving beta.
lol they finally finished the game....
Thought you guys said there were NOT to be any new versions of the game, just the initial release.
GIVE US Oro and Sean Please
It took them this long to put in an arcade mode? I feel like it was forever ago when they added the story mode but I'll be honest beating the original street fighter was more fun. Street Fighter five was better than street fighter the movie the game though.. can't even force myself to make it through that game.
Good move capcom now make the right choices for infinite and things will go your way drop a huge graphics patch music adjustments and a massive roster overhaul
holyshit arcade mode is it true?
Street Fighter is vastly superior to Mortal Kombat.
SFV is not doing fine and MVCi is rising fast, so Capcom need to buff SFV to keep SFV alive.
how everyone says how cool and nice this is from capcom.\nThis is something that should have been in the game right from the start.
So its a free update for those who bought sfv
OMGOMG THATS WHAT MAKES CAPCOM A GREAT COMPANY!!!
Now what we need is the version MVCI arcade complete no more dlc edition
Better fix bullshit in this game balrog,cammy,and fucking zangief so  god damn tired of getting grabbed a light speed can't even do a combo with his bitch ass around
Are characters gonna be free too?
I can't believe it's been 30 years for this franchise
If I buy this version, will my christmas Juri dlc transfer
We were sold the beta version, so MVCI I will wait for the free update and not buy DLC
This is what Street Fighter wanted, Dhalsim's brother Dhalsim said paint.
And the third update going to be super street fighter 5 and the final updated going to be ultra street fighter 5 with 60 playable characters?, i hope so
Just one question.I have season 1 pass but not season 2,will this effect me if i cant get it for a free update?.i got season 1 pass on day one of release with the collectors edition.
The update it's free, but the season 1 and 2 characters not. Right?
It's obvious that all of those dislikes are from people who didn't buy the game.
Whos coming for season 3 tell us Capcom
So, the DLC characters will become free?
*Phone rings and Sagat answers\nSagat: What? \nCapcom: We aren't doing too well.\nSagat: .....on my way
Nice only 2 more years for ultra sfv
I have a Xbox.
Remember the SFV will not have the same shit treatment as sf4/ssf4/usf4? ... look at this
Time to redownload my SFV
Super Ultra Mega Street Fighter V: Arcade Neo Hyper Giga Climax HD 4K VR Reloaded ReMix Tournament Edition 2: Electric Boogaloo
Switch version please
Ehh should have released a complete package in the first place
HOPESTAR OF CAPCOM\nGIVE ME THE FAME, THE MONEY, THE GLORY OF ARCADE EDITION
Except I as a day one player still have to grind endlessly to unlock all characters(or cave and pay up) while Arcade buyers get a code to unlock them right away. One step forward 2 steps back seems to be par for the course with Capcom these days.
i love street fighter
Nice games almost out of beta
Best fighting game e ver!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well I'm guessing I'm head to the arcade, cause tk7 arcade ass I'm huge tekken fan myself but come OK harada just 5 matches tk6 arcade was a lot better but he well learned, I bet sense ono put arcade in it harada going to compete well sure as hell love competition 
If the leaks are true, people who buy this will actually get bamboozled because they'll have to grind Fight Money to unlock the DLC characters instead of having them right away, a grind which of course (Capcom being Capcom) can be dodged by just buying the currency directly.
Yay another beta game being sold for $60
Hey look, more content that should've been a launch. Why are we excited again? Because it's free?
wait they're not making an xbox one version..........................\n.................,............................,\nFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
This game has been out for almost 2 years. Like it's great that it's getting a update, but street fighter 4 was a better game.
Too fucking late, this turd died a year ago and still stinks up your fan trust Capcom.
Ok, I think I get it. So my $40 that I spent when it came out doesn't get me s1 and s2 characters. But if I had waited two years, my $40 would get me s1 and s2 characters. But at least everything else is free.
Do i see graphics Update Textures & no Polygons? \nNow that something i need to buy SF5 with all DLCs & extra contents
there's more,  SUPER Street Fighter V: ULTIMATE NEW CHALLENGER Edition
WICKED AWESOME!
Ok cool now im going buy street fighter i figured I would wait till this came out
If they put a Tekken character in....\n\n\n\n\nThen I'm all ears Capcom.
I know that it's a free dlc for people who own the game, but are we all gonna forget about capcom saying that they won't be making new physical versions of the game? This is the first step guys, ultra sfv will be a thing, and don't be surprised if they charge for that one.
Judging by the description, this wasn’t clickbait, the subscriptions were also obvious.
Ultra Hyper Mega Turbo Super Street Fighter V  Deluxe Edition. Avalaible on April of 2023
This is amazing
There's a misconception that's every is free. IT'S NOT.  For the people that bought the original SF5, you still have to pay for the season 1 and 2 DLC characters....that's not included in this update for you guys
Xbox one x
It's a *completely free* Update of a game that cost 18.99-$20 max in stores.\nTake that damn dislike off the video, Capcom did okay with this one.
GOT DAMMIT CAPCOM, YOU GUYS ALWAYS FIND A WAY TO GET US BACK HYPE. YOU GUYS MOLDED MY CHILDHOOD. YOU GUYS ARE SO DOPE. THIS TRAILER BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES IM FREAKIN HYPE. THANK YOU CAPCOM. I PLAY ARENA FOOTBALL BUT DONT LIKE MADDEN MORE THAN MY FIGHTING GAMES. STREET FIGHTER ALL DAY BABY. ✊💯
I Really Miss SFIV AE
Worst Street Fighter, Ever.
Un chiste \n.....
*meh✅🙄*
When's Sakura?
Getting Tekken vibes from this
plz dont fuck this up
Too late Capcom....too damn late
BOUT DAMN TIME, GOOD JOB CAPCOM
evil ryu bitches
I want oni...
Still no Joudan Sokutogeri for Ryu smh
haters gonna hate hate hate hate im just gonna play play play
Far too little\nFar too late
MUST...\nREINSTALL...
SSJ1 Akuma?
free??????? capcom and free????
Este mensaje va para Capcom,\nSi queréis que el juego triunfe y que sea un éxito en ventas, tenéis que añadir a la edición arcade el pase de temporada 3 y 4 también. Aparte, empezar el juego con todos los escenarios desbloqueados, y tener la posibilidad de desbloquear todos los trajes, incluidos los premium con el fight money. En resumidas cuentas, la gente que compre el Arcade Edition, que lo tenga todo sin tener que realizar ningún pago en el futuro, eso haría que yo mismo comprara esta nueva edición y eso que pagué los 70 Euros de Street Fighter V. Para que lo entendáis mejor, echar un vistazo al Battlefield 1 Revolution, que inlcuye todo el contenido y los próximos DLC's en un único pago,  39,95 Euros/Dólares.
.... but there is no arcade cabinet
FUCK YOU CAPCOM , you dont give the dlc for people who've already played your unfinished game????
still feels incomplete if you ask me
You need to pay for a arcade mode shit
Sorry its not in spanish for you spanish speaking people.
Estoy 100% seguro  q el comentarista es chileno
I think Chile can make it to at least the semi finals in the world cup.
Me da gracia, hay mas perucas que propios Chilenos, como siempre pendiente de su padre.
soy peruano y trabajo en Chile hace cuatro años ...quiero a mi pais y quiero ver a la roja en el mundial ...viva chile carajo !
ya llegaron los chilependientes, perucas de mierda
Que buen relator este chileno jaja broma, saludos de Paraguay, muy buen partido.
jejejjeje ese es mi chile el bicampeon del mundo
Me pareció bueno que Chile gane. Pero ni Ecuador  ni Chile recuperan su nivel.\nMe pareció un poco pobre el partido.
Las clasificatorias sudamericanas sin duda las mejores del planeta.
Chile great team... we wanna see it in Rusia!
Chile gano sufriendo , gracias a ese defensa bruto de Ecuador q se resbalo😡😡, y colombia estaba celebrando y burlándose de otros y ahora esta en riesgo lol, estas eliminatorias sudamericanas ya nadie es local , cualquier cosa puede pasar en cualquier minuto , solo se respira cuando el arbitro diga Fin
Jajaja Brasil los va hacer mierda!!!
Bien Chile, se que va al mundial.  Lo que me da mucha rabia que siempre veo comentarios de personas incultas, que se dejan llevar por los medios de comunicación y se tiran mierda con comentarios, yo soy Chileno y amo mi patria,tengo familia en Argentina y amigos en Perú y Colombia , pero si mi selección no va al mundial, sin lugar a dudas apostaría por mis vecinos Sudamericanos :)
que me hacen reir los chilependientes
3 cupos para 5 equipos,esta claro que CHILE es el que la tiene mas dificil ya que jugamos con brasil,paraguay es el que la tiene mas facil pero veremos muy pronto de que estamos echos,peruanos muy agrandados por que le empataron a argentina cuando le ganen 2 finales consecutivas hablamos...
Brasil Uruguay Perú Paraguay Argentina.Despúes no digan que no avise.Chi chi chi le le le lo mira por la tele!!! Por las dudas soy uruguayo.
K lastima k no hay carteles en ecuador
Chileno que no le gusta la pinga no es chileno :V
El 2do gol de Chile : Cerca a su área, un defensa ecuatoriano está en posesión del balón, un delantero chileno lo empuja, hace caer al defensa, el árbitro no cobra infracción, y se generó el gol chileno
espero que chile no juegue sucio  porque ya lo hicieron antes en BRASIL https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maracanazo_de_la_selecci%C3%B3n_chilena\n\nЯ надеюсь, что чили не играют грязной, потому что они уже делали это раньше в БРАЗИЛИИ
Que asco con ecuador como regala ese segundo gol así , se nota que querían favorecer a los rotos por que Perú los dejó fuera del mundial
Ese ecuatoriano quería cancherear jajajajaja GOL CTM
GO GO Chile!!
Q maricones los chilenos así noma meten gol
todos aca me chupan el pene especialmente messi jajajajaj
Hasta paraguay les gana
Volvió esa mierda de valdivia, bueno en fin la mayoría son una mierda: jara, arturo, medel, etc
Argentina y Chile quedaran fuera. Firmalo.
Fixed match
Chileno hijo de puta raz asquerosa
SI NO QUIEREN QUE TANTO NOS OCUPEMOS DE USTEDES, PORQUERÍAS, SIMPLEMENTE NO TROLEEN NI COMENTEN HUEVADAS EN VIDEOS PERUANOS, NO PIDAN DEMASIADO, PORQUE IGUAL VAMOS A SEGUIR JODIENDOLES MIENTRAS NOS SIGA DANDO LA PUTA GANA, VAMOS PERÚ CARAJO, EL CAMINO A RUSIA TOTALMENTE DESPEJADO, CARAJO!!!!
spasibo loco
estaban sufriendo
Tmr xk melas te vendiste Ecuador joder
es gracioso ver a peruano chilenos y ecuatorianos llamando se monos entre sí \na jajajaja todos son monos!!
Chilenos el martes lleven su bacelina q brasil se las va a meter doblada rotos hijos de perras :) ! Peru y argentina en el mundial fuera chilenos indios :)
error del back ecuatoriano
Esperaba mas de esa seleccion pero la victoria que han tenido contra ecuador,no fue tan merecido,ya que sus dos goles fueeron regaladas por los defensas ecuatorianas .....veremos con brazil ahora!!!
Pobre Chile, Brasil lo va a violar en casa
cholo, deja de estar pendiente de tu padre, entro a ver los goles de Chile y solo veo a cholos picotas comentando
Les regalaron el partido a los chilenos.
uds creen que brasil les regalara algo o se dejara ganar o empatar , brasil se perfila como primera potencia futbolistica y quiere recuperar eso . mucho menos quiere cerrar con derrota en su propia casa que ingenuos. ya fueron chilenos.
Vamos Paraguay carajo!!
Es increíble como los peruanos culiaos andan mas preocupados de Chile que de su mierda de selección jajajaj
TODO ESTAMIS IGUALADOS POR UN PUNTO CADA UNO EL MARTES SE JUEGA SU FINAL ASI DE SIMPLE. AQUI YA NO ESTAN LAS MATEMATIKAS ETC.. EL MARTES ES UN PARTIDO PARA CADA SELECCION SU PASE ALA FINAL..
Por la culpa de quinteros no pasamos al mundial:( pero ahora ay que pensar en catar
ROTOS Y LA REPUTA QUE LOS PARIO...
SOLO EL CHILENO EN EL SEGUNDO GOL NO LO MARCÓ NADIE Y SEGUNDOS ANTES OTRO CHILENO HABÍA HECHO FALTA
Waa genial ver como muestran estos partidos en Europa y en Rusia en especial
se viene un partido difisil que es brasil
3:15 que emocionante el relato😭😭 claramente lo dise hdjndidjdjdbĢuiűű§😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hello Neymar tengo lubricante para el martes
4:05 \n*voz de Homero*\nEs que es mi primer dia!
Me gusta como otros paises le tienen miedo a chile y ven los videos y todo, siempre atentos a los superiores
tanta gente insultando a los países vecinos y creyéndose el cuento de que pueden “predecir” de que uno le ganará al otro...en serio digo , no se pueden calentar por un juego...que inmadurez más impresionante , pero bueno , de mal en peor van todos . Que gane el equipo que mejor juegue , ya fue .
estos peruanos que llegan solitos a humillarse, les gusta decir que Brazil nos va hacer mierda, les gusta escuchar eso por que su selección nunca lo hará xDd
NADA MAS CON ESTOS TRAIDORES DE ECUADOR!!
Es tan malo ese gueon de bravo
Ke inocentes estos de ecu! No te pueden meter 2 goles robandole la pelota al defensor!!
una cancha que parece un patatal pero no es culpa de la gran seleccion chilena, es el Estadio Nacional y sus putos conciertos de Guns n Roses y Def Leppard, una pesima pesima organizacion.  Coordinacion mediocre.
El arquero se entregó en el primer gol
chicos pasen por mi canal, tengo videos interesantes que les pueden servir como bajar sin límites por mega, hackear wifi , juegos y otros trucos y programas , saludos
increible como lo perdio ecuador,estamos meados por un dinosaurio
Brasil en tus manos encomendamos nuestros espíritus(Colombia,Peru,Argentina,Paraguay)
puta que son feo los chilenos weon, la cagó XD
Ecuador se puede ir con la frente muy en alto si elimina a Argentina del mundial.Sera recordado por los Argentinos eternamente.
Ahora con Brasil moriremos peleando hasta el final. Muy buena eliminatoria.
rotitos por los ingleses para
Puta madre! Renovaron Ecuador completamente y si mejoro el ataque pero la defensa de antes se tiene que quedar. Necesitamos Ayovi, Erazo, Mina, y Ramírez. A chillier también está bueno en Mexico
POR FAVOR UN EMPATE EN BRASIL Y DESPUÉS QUE SE VALLA pizzi Y LLEGUE PELLEGRINI
Jajaja lo bueno q Brasil de local no a perdido ni cagando perderá con los chiliindios.\nVa mejorando el idioma chiliindio entendi al comentarista cuando dijo ecuatoria jajaja
Buen partido, saludos de Perú
vidal hijo de puta sige diciendo que por culpa de los que juegan en mexico la seleccion esta mal por eso vargas t mando a callar!! pendejo
Super Duper Bonus TurnOver Bulanan hingga 60juta lebih  hanya di JPS POKER
Difícil estas eliminatorias, esto se putio porq ganó Paraguay, chilenos diciendo q ya clasificaron. Acaso no ven que se van a enfrentar a Brasil, selección que jamás a perdido en eliminatorias  y que está hecho una máquina para jugar al fútbol? Argentinos, ir a ganar en la altura de Ecuador? Colombianos y peruanos que partido más duro, y paraguayos, acaso no han visto los últimos tres partidos de Venezuela? Esto está jodido
ECUADOR 1  - CHILINDIOS MARICAS LAMEHUEVOS  DE LOS INGLESES   2
Dicen que Chile perdera ante Brasil, nunca hablen despues de tiempo. O quedaran como Argentina, decian que les iban a ganar a Chile 3, 4 a 0 a Chile en la Copa America 2015 y 2016 y que paso? Nunca subestimen a NADIE
Mala suerte para los chilenos😡😡😡xd
Que se siente que ningún país de tu continente te quiera ... Afuera chile
SOY CHILENO ME ENCANTA EL PERRO AL HORNO Y LOS BRASILEÑOS NOS VAN A DAR UNA MANO POR QUE NO LES GUSTAN LOS ARGENTINOS  PERO NADIE  ME  QUIERE SOLO POR QUE ME ADUEÑO DE SUS COMIDAS Y SUS TRAGOS  OJO COMPRO ARBITROS Y DIGO QUE SOY EL CAMPEON DE AMERICA
si le hubiesemos ganado a paraguay de local o ha bolivia de visita estariamos clasificados.😑
Espero que el pueblo chileno se haya dado cuenta que este partido fue comprado... basta con ver el error del defensor ecuatoriano seguido de la marca del resto de los defensores ecuatorianos que se quedaron mirando al linea pidiendo offside
Like si crees que este partido estaba actuado como juegan los ecuaterianos....???? este partido está comprado por chile...observen a los de ecuador cuando chile tiene la pelota..
en el segundo gol de Chile fue falta, empujo al defensa.
ese ultimo gol de los culo rotos parece comprado..... Defensa ecuatoriana=cagada
Chilenos hijos de puta
Chile sufrirà la venganza brasileira de haber tenido la osadía de quererlos eliminar en su mundial. Si creen que Brasil por no tener nada que perder jugarà por compromiso, ni lo sueñen; seràn su saco de arena para desquitarse de todo lo que les sucedió en 2014… van a ver.
Monos de mierda echándose a favor de los rotos
Buena come perros.
235 COMEPERROS LES GUSTA ESTO :V
Pinches chilenos roban siempre cabranes los partidos pero brasil los hara mierda
CHILENO MAL PARIDO HIJO DE PERRA FEOS HDP NO IRAN AO MUNDIAL BRASIL LES METERA PINGA CON SALIVA BRASIL 6 CHILE GAY 0
si a Perú también le regalaron tres puntos
Que sospechoso ese segundo gol
si ganamos en brasil   meo en todas la banderas de america puta , si perdemos cago en las misma puta
Juegan con el arbitro a su favor, así cualquiera gana :v
su primer gol de chile acepto pero el segundo no no saben jugar pasaron no se lo llevaron mierda maricones asieron trampa con uruguayo
vengo del futuro  PERU clasifica directo al mundial , argentina  clasifica  en cuarto lugar  y paraguay  en quinto lugar se va al repechaje .
para todos los putos que dijieron que ya estabamos eliminados chupenla jajajajjja aparecio el campeon de america hijos de puta a tragarse sus palabras jajajajaja
that was fucking amazing duuuude!!! nicely done!
i want a full Movie !!! Where is Hollywood?
마지막 프라이팬에서 개터졌네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
this basically represent every noob in the game .
As much as I love and support Corridor Digital, you seem to be much better in terms of scale and creativity.
The movie would be great
More like the actual game than the CorridorDigital video.
i d'like this video plot  \n\ndose plot pretty well appear what is the pubg
This is bassicly what happens when you play pubg for the first time.
This is the school

Dude this is awesome!! Great work!
0:30 Banana Man?
Суперспецеффекты !
This was sick
This is epic
Great work! I loved how you recreated the massacre at the start, especialy liked the blue dacia hitting a fella. I'm astonished how good the buggy jump, flight and landing looked from editing perspective with all the dust and sounds, excellent work indeed. The whole stimming gave a good laugh as he swallowed every pill :D. Keep up the good work, love your videos!
Damn the sound effects are amazing!
I can’t find the remix song. What’s the name and where do I find it?
By far the best fan made video I've ever seen, bravo brother.
Fuck Julien Bam \nThats the real shit on Youtube 😀
While I like Corridor's version a lot. This definitely had better vfx.
Is there some other reason why i see so many Asian type comments? Just curious
Is there a place to download the music?
This is the best thing ever!
respect for such dedication... fantastic detail to everything... Cheers!!
The pan scene at the end xD
That was very good. Keep up the good work.
Why is the image quality of the video so bad? Everything is very cool! But why is the resolution so fuzzy?
The frying pan,  the legendary  weapon  used for both cooking  and Knocking  TF out of ppl XD
밀베냐 ㅋㅋㅋ 정말 정신없구만..
시체파밍안하는거불편하네
nukazooka's video has a ending that is  dark but not very satisfying death.
4:14 But nobody dies in the red zone...
This is the best video i've seen 👍
trying to meme too hard its bad.
It's pretty fun
nice video and nice music:)
Did he survived ? :'(
nice video！

0:38 로드롤러다!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2렙가방버리네;

개굳
ㅋㅋㅋ good
It's dangerous to walk alone. Here, take this pan.
I like this cause it seems like a lot less colorful, dark, and menacing BR, which would be a good change in things as pubg is really a cute little world. I know this is a film, I just wish games had the same idea.
덕중에 덕은 양덕이라더니

asombroso
damn thoz cinematics tho
U r to good bro..
For me, you two are the best comedy duo I've ever known. With content like this, there's no way you don't blow up eventually.
This was a better love story than Twilight.
Posting a day late? Forgiven
Huge thanks to 20th Century Fox and YouTube Space LA for letting us shoot on the incredible ALIEN: COVENANT set! That is awesome dudes!
Who HASNT had their best friends wiener on their forehead? Not true best friends is who
This has become one of my favorite channels in a short amount of time
It's funny, for that entire exchange I thought all they had to do was just push the door open. Like they didn't even try moving it at all before they started talking about their friendship. Would have been a heck of a punchline.
Wait. That's David's lair in Alien Covenant.
Sorry, I just didn't really think this was funny.
wow this was funny im mad that this should have more views i will share it tho
consistently well-scripted, well-executed, well-edited, well-produced; the youtube algorithm messed up big time
I have no friends.
One of the best channels on Youtube.
That was hilarious, you guys have to be the best short film creators on Youtube.
I just can't get over the fact that's Sokka. Fucking Sokka dude.
I love a good channel that puts the focus on the right factors in their sketches. Its not like WOOO WE CAN EDIT REALLY WELL and the sketches never really revolve around the editing or anything directly related to pop culture or anything. Always very obscure and interesting. Really its just the disctinction between intelligent people and unintelligent people, and you guys are obviously the former.
most underrated channel on youtube. no contest. this video even made me feel better about settling things with my best friend tomorrow. thank you guys, please keep it up.
GUYS. 👏🏼 you're killing it.
CMON MAN! YOU DONT JUST LET THAT STUFF GO
Visit the channel if you want to access the straight path.\nvisit this channel to listen to Holy Quran the last book from the God!!to humanity.\nVisit the channel if you want to reach happiness and comfort ! In this life and the Hereafter.
The best goddamn chanel on all of youtube
This video literally helped me figure out some things about me and my best friend LOL. Thanks
I was dying throughout the whole video! keep it up you guys!
This was so funny and so well done!
i love you guys
I think a good way for you guys to get more views is to do a more frequent side series or something.  I'd love to see more of you guys even if it's not your usual big production videos
Man you guys are a true inspiration, every single video is straight fire and so quotable. Beautiful \nI strive to make our channel as good as you guys. One day
Well wiener on the forehead IS a classic prank, just saying *shrug emoji*
Better acting then twilight as well. Hell, its easy when its true.
The production value alone on these is absolutely incredible! Paired with the chemistry you guys have and the HILARIOUS writing, I'm honestly hooked! One a month is just unfair! Keep it up guys, you're amazing ❤
Damn, you guys are good at this
Always top notch comedy from Chris and Jack.
This is why we bring pickaxes and tnt on expeditions
There's something really wrong about these guys not having at least a million subscribers. One awesome video after the other!
Always a great surprise ending!
You guys are so creative! KEEP IT UP!!!
You guys covered so much ground with this one.
Like we haven't ALL taken a picture with Chris' weiner.
I can't think of a funnier duo than these two, not Jake and Amir, not Jack and Dean, not even Rick and Morty.
These are always so inspirational! And funny.
SO GOOD, as always !!
Put on headphones in the middle of a lecture just to watch this. \n\nI'm in medical school.
My question is where do you get the budget?
The smallest channel i'm subscribed to but also my favorite, I love it keep it up and it will pay off!
Jesus this is amazing
Okay wow! so this is the set of Alien Covenant. Was there scenes in that location in the movie?
seriously where are all your subscribers guys? like every video is gold!
Ahhhhhh so excited to see you guys upload!!
Please don't encode 21:9 with black bars. Otherwise great video!
I once too put my wiener on someone's forehead.....
Who is bankrolling the productions of these videos?
How do you not get more views?! Keep up the good work!
Im so surprised that you guys don't have more subs, you are one of my favorite channels
How do you guys come up with these awesome crazy sketch ideas? xD
Shared this with my two best friends. Boy, that's going to cause some issues. Someone is getting left in the Scorpion Tunnel.
Slow and steady you’re growing, keep it up guys!
Thank you Jack and Chris for another awesome skit!
I jumped terribly at that last trap. lol poor jack jack
The month does not pass fast enough!  I want more!!! Love these guys
I knew it. But damn it was good.
I just found your channel the other day and you guys are honestly so funny! I'm definitely gonna show your stuff to my friends, you deserve a lot more views and subscribers!\nA lot of love from Germany:)
I'm not your friend, guy!
I am going to show it to all my Best Friends.
Sent this to my best friend right away! Your videos are so good and i get so excited when the new ones come out!!
Please never stop making these videos. Even if you may not have a huge amount of subscribers, eventually someone in the large productions business will notice you guys 100%
How, how have you guys not blown up yet
I love this unique humor you guys have.  I feel like this is more of a series than a youtube channel, and it should be called The Infinite Realities of Chris and Jack.\n\nI remember meeting you guys at FilmQuest a few years back and saw Movies in Space.  I thought it was the best film at the fest.  I've been following your channel ever since the first video you posted.  I'm a fan. Great job guys!
Damn, I never clicked on the thumbnail of a video so fast before in my life
This was amazing! Really proud of you guys! 😚
Damn, the production is getting better and better.\nKudos guys! You are the best (friends)!
Favorite channel on YouTube hands down
Would have been funnier if after the rock fell, the guy who got squished goes, Uh, best friend? A little help here? Please?
The real treasure was inside you all along!\n\n...now let me get inside you.
liked? check. comment? check. subscribe? check. share? check.\n\nWHAT ELSE CAN I DO. YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST.
This is like high school reunion levels of awkward mixed with that weird moment your calls you out and asks which of your friends you like more in front of them.  Absolutely loved it!
Your writing is so good!  I show people the White Room all the time!
>Best comedy duo on youtube\n>only 64000 subs\nWhat the fuck.
Beautiful. This deserves more views! Subscribe to these guys and help them out!!!
Great stuff as usual!
that fucking ending lmaooo
So fucking creative
You guys are amazing.
Amazing as always :)
WOOOOOOOO NEW CHRIS AND JACK VID!
Amazing video
Thanks for adding subtitles
Thank you
Classic! :D
Haha yeah everyone's been there... *laughs nervously*
Classic prank!
Lmao I fucking love it.
YAYYYYYY
Classic prank!
That was amazing!
True story.
Excellent!
That was dark!
wer ist alles wegen kiavier hier???
The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, my friends!\n\nRepent of your sins and put your faith in Jesus Christ!\n\nHe loves you so much! He died so that you may live! Thank You, Jesus! \n\nThings are only going to get a lot more worse, because this world is due for judgement. But Jesus has made a way for us to escape, and that Way is The Lord! \n\nTomorrow is not promised to any of us, but Free Salvation in The Lord is! Hallelujah!\nTo die without Jesus is very dangerous, so please consider making Jesus Lord of YOUR life! \n\nCall upon The Lord, and allow Him to wash away your sins. \nBecome born-again through the Power of the Holy Spirit! You will become new!!\n\nShalom, friends.
That door is racist
The way Alessia was looking at Johnathan when he was trying to feed her was like smirking as if to say im not going to open my mouth 😁😁😁
Did they change the title and thumbnail? Thought it was named ‘feeding the baby’ before and had a picture of Alessia and a spoon?
Alessia is finally in that phase where babies have developed their growing personalities.  She's so cute and tiny petite..., just like Erika!  I think Alessia is going to be the most precious of all your children.  She's just a little beauty with those drop dead gorgeous baby blues and her long dark lashes.  Emilia has a built in best friend and Eduardo will have the company of two great sisters to walk through life with.  Of course, a brother will even the odds for Eduardo and give him a brother/best mate to leverage his odds, but I'll just leave that area up to you guys.  Love your vlogs!!!
Love you, guys!!  :*
 So good morning. I am naked!
I KNEW I couldn't possibly be the only person in the world who says Whatever song is playing on the radio when I turn it on will depict how the day is going to go !!!!!!!!!!!!! Woooooo !!! Haha !! Thanks Johnathen !! 😍😍😍
Awww Alessia was so happy to see her mommy in the beginning of the video. Too precious for words!!!
Anna you are so right ❤ dont ever listen to other people. A mom always knows whats the best for her children/babys. + you can never cuddle your baby to much. Enjoy every minute ❤
I love Eduardo's passion for Little Mix 😂😂
In Germany it is more common to put the baby in a sleeping bag - because blankets can move over to her face overnight and she might get too less air
eduardo's favorite song is shout out to my ex by little mix?? omg that's funny! hahaha
i love how excited the kids got on the bowl game x so lovely xx
You are such a good mom.  It's a lot of work and you do a wonderful job.  What a good example you are for others when it comes to parenting. Love watching you guys.  Been watching since Emilia was a baby.  It just keeps getting better.
why don't you put alessia in that like thing that moves up and down and its always moving maybe she'll enjoy it and set it outside the nursery door so she can see you. then maaaybe the little cutie will let you do thing without holding her. I'm sure she will cry at first but yeah shouldn't get her use to always being carried cause that's what happens. she gets spoil and thinks well if I cry mom will pick me up lol
😂Eduardo coughing at Alessia's was so funny , I love the kids theyre so cuttee❤️
It's bounces off and out cause its a spiky ball
Guys it's been officially one year since i've watched sacconejolys every single day! love you guys
alessia is so cuteeee! can we have her haha?
Anna YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL 👏🏻👏🏻
I wish it was cold in Texas where I live 😕 -*jealous*
I hear ya Anna! You rock as a mom :)
The best bit made me roar with laughter Jonathan feeding the baby and get bored face. And Eduardo stripping off. Typical child  very funny
I'm in love with this family.
I love that. Anna is ignoring all the 'don't hold your baby too much' 'rule and doing whatever she feels right for her I love that really like whatever makes ur baby happy and is working no matter what the rules are then do it like so what at least it's working for u and the baby. I love it
Get your baby snuggles while you can.
Let Allessia nap in your room while you tackle the nursery
When are yall moving?? Lol at Jonathan's Comment...Alessia is so cute!
Middle child syndrome 😂😂😂😋😂 I'm a middle child
Anna, I feel the nursery isn’t a very big room. A little fussing a crying is okay, if she gets hysterical, yes plz pick her up. But if you wanna redo it, maybe put her in her crib, play some soft music or fun kid songs she likes and continuously talk or sing to her as you work to redo her room the way you want so she hears your voice and knows your close. Maybe take breaks every half hr or 10 min to hold her and play with her, then do another 10 min or so. It will take longer then if you were alone (but what doesn’t with kids) but I feel you can get it done. Could work? Worth a shot?
Anna you are my idol!!!! Such a strong and inspiring woman 🌸🌸
Aleesia is cute.  She loves that camera!  What is everyone being for Halloween?
Do you like to baby wear? Maybe that’s help getting stuff done!
You guys are such a beautiful family. I really love watching your videos. You always lift my spirits up. Keep being awesome. <3
Eduardo I am naked. He always cracks me up.
Anna I'd love to see your nighttime routine! Like makeup removal to bed! :)
Hi everyone, I'm wanting to give it a shot at vlogging so I have memories to look back on. Should my channel be called\n- Zac and Sophie\nor\n- Sophie + boys\nAm open to any other suggestions too! ☺\nMy fiance name is Zac and we have 2 little boys.\nThanks for the help ☺❤
My mom called me her broach because i never wanted to be away from her.
Alessia is a smiling baby like Emilia when she was young. Hahaha! Edwardo was the opposite.
I can't believe Eduardo only 3 it sounds weird when you say interview with my three year old so cute my little cousin is 3 Lenny and he still can't speak very well he can speak but he still can't say proper conversations and when he does try you don't under stand he turnt three 2 weeks ago xx
My brother is Eduardos age and all he wants to do is strip off it's so funny but annoying xx 😘
Love the kiddos. Love u all!
My 3 year old brother likes Steve and Maggie
Anna never mind what others think you are both great parents and no matter what age we are we want and hug from mammy
the most adorable family on the internet 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
“don’t press that button!” Haha Jonathan’s Irish accent really came out there
Omg when Edwardo said that emelia was his girlfriend, dead 😂😂😂
Shoutout to my ex😂 Eduardo is hilarious 😂🙈
A lovely video I really enjoyed watching it :):) :):) emilia, Eduardo and alessia are so cute emilia was so adorable when she said  wait why are you talking? 😀🐶❤️ Eduardo was so sweet when he said  good morning my friendliest friend very slowly and when johnathan asked him if he had a girlfriend he said   yes then when johnathan said what is her name? Eduardo said  emilia and alessia looked so cute when she was smiling at the camera when johnathan was holding her :):) :):) \n\nAnna what you could do is give alessia a dummy for comfort x \n\nJohnathan is a great dad and Anna is a lovely mum x
How cute are your kids!! Love watching your videos 💚💛❤️💙
When are use going to move house
Get a Lillebaby carrier, Anna! It will help so so so much. The 6 in 1 Complete in Woven. Just trust me. SO SOFT.
Eduardo: So good morning I am naked cracked me up! 😂😂😂
Johnathan is teaching Amelia how to be the queen of beer pong when she's older 😂😂😂😂
That ball you were using was way to bouncy. Fun though. Alessia looking at Emilia at the dinner table was so cute.
Just keep cuddling as much as you want to. The time flies too quickly.
Eduardos saying is I'm Anna or I'm Elsa😂❤️
Ha-Ha!  Jonathon is so hilarious - Why is the tv show from last night coming over the radio?!  Anna is right, there is no such thing as loving a baby too much! 💕
I adore Eduardo he is just adorable is hillarious and extremely clever and we'll developed for his age!!!😋😉😃👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👶🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕
I laughed sook hard this vlog :\nEmilia: Wait! Why are YOU talking😂😂😂
anna is sooo gorgeous though:(
Ffs
Oh my gosh is it me or is jonathan screaming nonstop at the camera? I wish he would just talk normal sometimes and not so animated.
EDUARDO GETTING NAKED AND JUMPING IN THE CRIB WITH ALESSIA IS THE MOST BIZARRE THING I HAVE EVER WITNESSED.
that baby looks like Miley Cyrus
Sweet Eduardo
Im dead! Emilia - Diahrrea, diahrrea (sp?) shes so funny!
Not worth listening to Senborra\nSACCNOE JOLYs are multimillon subscribed and worth it \nGot muted.........
Hi Guys!
Just take it
Yes Eduardo!!! Mini mixer right there!!!!
Amazing parenting! :)
The cutest kids ever 💕
Aww
Fav irish family 💚
Did you change the title or is it just me ?
Pobre bb no tiene cámara para mirarla y no tiene protección la cuna el video anterior se metió un golpe muy feo porfavor tengan más cuidado los amoooooooo
Prepping the kids for beer pong, a useful skill in high school and college. Lol
Jonathon, stop screaming.  Are you on something your so hyper active weird in this video.  I wonder why the children don't listen, hmmmmmm.
Emilia and Edwardo need more discipline. They should not talk to you or ignore what you say
Emilia is Eduardo's hero and gf.
I can’t believe Eduardo is only 3! He acts so much older I think!
You were saying we're moving soon and when we move a lot these past few weeks, now it's all we're never moving what happened??! Please fill us in more about this, it's so confusing 🤔
Ok I Alesia's adorable we get it. But did they forget they have 2 other kids? I know babies attract more views🙄 but come on. Almost every thumbnail lately has been Alessia
Silly spoons for feeding babies
What day was this filmed on. Are the vlogs not filmed the day before they're uploaded anymore?😔😭
watch +kavos video about family vloggers
Lol @ Jonathan feeding alessia, typical Man slopping it everywhere 😂
At 6:49 Edwardo is naked 😱😱😱😱😱😱
I haven't watched lately!  What happed with the new house? Are they getting a new house like they said? Or what happened?
Who remembers when Emilia would just sit and rock and bang her head? 🤣🤣🤣 smh
Have you tried baby wearing so you can get stuff done? All my friends swear by it to get the housework done!
Emilia saying Give me some hope LOL she is adorable
Anna, I love you honesty. I had a baby boy around the same time as you did Alessia (I think they are about 2 weeks apart) and with it being my second I have really struggled with some of the day to day!! I think you're doing an amazing job and you are just so real!! Thank you for making me fee like I am doing a great job too. Xxx
Does anyone know what is Vodafone please leave in the comments
Poor Edourdo he has  pressure of speech he never gets the chance to verbalise himself fully. Jonathon always has to be yapping  ALL the time
Omg she slept whole night on her tummy!Is it safe to do so.Bit confused as i was told to make my baby sleep on her back by my midwife😔
Eduardo is an expressive child. He have a big heart and plenty of love to give. Him getting naked is his way of saying that he does not want Alessia getting the grubbiness from his school clothes. I am sure his parents will teach him the norm of things as he grows older. He is only 3 For God's sake....
I really hope you taught Emilia and Eduardo they're not supposed to climb in the cot with Alessia unless you or Anna are there. I'm imaging all sorts of tragic scenarios here...
I finally realized who Anna reminds me of: Julia Roberts
I don t know when they are moving but it s hard to take all the things that they need in the new house and they have 2 kids in school and a baby it must be hard
YB and Evan are two of my favourite Buzzfeed members! Just behind Shane and Ryan (Unsolved), Zach and Keith (Try Guys), and just ahead of Stephen and Andrew from worth it!
it's not complete without kelsey
I just had like two burgers and a fudge ton of fries and my stomach is killing me and I'm watching this and I'm actually puking
1:55. There's an article saying in n out managers and lawyers can earn the same over a decade working towards it yet only one will have massive student loan debts. Moral is if you work hard and can wait 10-15 years you can make a lot and have food benefits as an in n out manager
That's American for you
It's out of pure curiosity but I always see YB eating a lot of unhealthy food. However, she never seems to gain weight.
Do buzzfeed people only hang out with other buzzfeed people?
As a vegan, this is my worst nightmare
Evan is from heaven 😍
Just wondering if YB actually has hyperthyroidism... She eats a lot but is too skinny even if she says she exercises every day.
Buzzfeed is trying to fucking kill these 2. They always do the eating challenges
When the said 100X100 I thought it was like 10,000 so step it up buzzfeed
I'm not assuming bc I wouldn't know- but I feel like YB may have an eating disorder bc she can eat so much (binges) but shes pretty skinny...?
Why am I watching this? This is literally a vegetarian's worst nightmare.
YB what a fucking beast!
Pathetic
YB is so pretty !
THROW THE TOMATOES AWAY HOW DARE YOU.
I love YB i can relate to her soo fucking much
K so I'm a 6'3 fatass and I couldn't eat more than 6.
What’re the point of these.
Who eats utensils on the burger?
Everyone: that is way too much!! \nMe: that looks quite um... Good. I say Breakfast and Lunch... Maybe Dinner.
how does she eat so much and so fast?
Everyone who gets into buzzfeed would get fat
If she's eats like that. You know what else she's good at eating.
i wish i could be like yb she loves eating but she has good body  😦😦
Its a good burger for a party, but not two people lmao
love these two,  expecially YB, seems so nice
How is this a challenge?
there goes evan's abs
This is what is wrong with the world
I have a husky too! And best dogs ever, but they have a ton of energy.
... Well, this is my 16\nI think i'm in love with her hahahah
The girl is a fucking savage!!!!
She always says things like Oh I don't know if I can do this and ends up eating the most in every video
I want in n out
I would have literally gained 20 lbs from what YB ate in one sitting. Life is so unfair.
What about kids in Africa
I wouldn't say that is a surprise. I worked for Panda Express. I knew several managers who made $100,000. It isn't super common but enough
they better be eating healthy for the rest of their lives
YB is a monster!! I wish i had her metabolism!!😅
I want to pipe her
i could eat this all my self
I can relate to YB. I eat more than my friends but I'm the thinness and i don't exercise ever.
I want in n out right now so badddddd bruvz!!
I'd need half a bottle of tequila for that.
In n Out is overrated. I  prefer Wendy's or Shake Shack any day over Inn n Out.
After 3 or 4 burgers I wouldn't be able to move ,these asians can eat !
YB is perfection. Evan's cool too
Jesus Christ yb you are the real boss dude!
dont mind being hired to do these :)
Cultural appropriation at it`s worst, there are no blonde asians, only white women can have blonde hair.
They’re making Evan lose his eight pack to make another ‘we got abs in a week’ video lol
Damn, only in America 😂
Meat is murder
did you know in and out burger dyes its meat?
You know what really grinds my gears? When they use the person who was featured in two fitness videos and that had  eat healthy for so long, And now their doing challenges like this. SMH 🤦‍♂️
YB can put down some food! YB!!!
Evan is so lucky for having YB and vice-versa
In n out is nasty
Way to get diabetes
6 figures for being a manager at IN N OUT?
I wonder how many times they impregnated the cow that provided the feast, before they drove a steel piston through her skull.  Aren’t you glad that you’re on top of the food chain?  That animals don’t have an impulse to fear?
It looks like a caterpillar 🐛
At least hire someone who can actually eat not like these 2... wtf buzzfeed
since when do you put fucking gloves to eat burgers
I don’t understand why they only had 2 people do it, and these two make a lot of similar videos. Have other people do it!
I could eat that
Lol my friend saw you guys buying those at ni n out
I could literally watch Evan do anything! ❤️❤️❤️
I want to see YB do competitive eating
I have never had In-N-Out....
Kind of find these video ideas pointless other than having views and revenue because it's just a waste of food.
How is YB so small. I love her btw
2:27 \nEvan: HELP MEEEE\nYB: 😂
WAIT I THOUGHT EVAN'S VEGAN?!?!?!?!

Only an idiot thinks getting rid of spiders is a good thing.
what about a question for next video like 'why do some people where glasses'
i didn't really consider the argument at first, but there are more to insects than i first thought, kill all wasps, fleas and mosquitoes, as they dojnt help the world, but leave cockroaches, they aren't really comman in, well whatever the name of the planet im from. space wasps are horrible!
Do a video about are animals ticklish
This is but a small price to pay to destroy the insect race.
#Dont forget to keep on thinking
WRONG ANSWER!!!, if all the bugs died, there would be no more glitches
So the character that talks is in a different world?
Bee are so critically important if they go we go, yikes!
I think bugs are a little cool now.
And if the world never died
kill off all mosquitoes(all blood sucking insects) roaches flies and spiders and i will be grateful
It,s no use!!!
I wish spiders will become extinct
Just get rid of mosquitoes and roaches.
And jurassic park wouldn't exist
Why the farmer had to be black 🤔🤔👀
Well FINALLY some one under stands me about cockroaches i  litterally told my brother the exact same thing,they look like aliens
Where do our last names come from?
Also, I for one think all insects are interesting and amazing. Even mosquitos and cockroaches, every little bug plays a big role in life. I am not afraid of a small bug anyway. I even picked up insects when I was young.
just watch the bee movie
1:09 a old black Luigi
Who's needs school when we got this channel
I love you content!!!! and think you guys should do a episodes on dyslexia!!!😁
I hate bugs on my alien planet they are evil!👽
Fleas, ticks, and mosquitos is the only species that should be wiped out.
2:13 hey i know him
How many galaxies are they?
Why do we laugh when we are getting tickled? Why do we only feel the tickle on certain parts of our body?
I bet we could get rid of some of the annoying or dangerous insects, and replace them with similar ones, who aren't that annoying/dangerous, so that it wouldn't disrupt the food chain. You know, like we often breed some of the animals or plant some trees in new regions. We could also try and genetically engineer them, to decrease some of the negative effects.
I think they are cool now
Kill all the insects

I'd jist get rid of bugs that harm you like mosquitos or fleas
I'm a millipede which are not insects but mariapods
I'll be scared of big roaches
Cockroaches sometimes reminds me of a pe*is
0:03\nBlocko : I was talking to my animator yesterday\nCaption : I took a visit to your human world the other day\n\nLol what Blocko said isn't as the same as the caption
Do a video on what would happen if humans could use 100% of their brains
Do a video on why do we get head headaches
What if there were no trees?
Hey Life Noggin :) can you make a vid why brainfreeze happen ? like so he can see itt :]
So am I wrong for killing that bug that was on my wall?
What will happend if we nuke a super volcano?
I wish Lizards would die out
If atoms make everything what makes atoms?
Yeah but what about flies? Can we get rid of them? I don't see a purpose for them.
Well I've seen Bee movie, so it's not very surprising
ok bugs are inportant but that dose not mean im cool with bugs i never wanna see them
You should do a video on why you feel pain after exercising for a while.  It's not a complex answer, but I'm sure you could make it interesting.
What happened if you look at internet non stop
Can you make what if you cummed everyday
What if all the insect - animal haters died? Nothing. The world would be a batter place, and only 700,000 people would live. Study about insects, and then you'll learn that they are important, more than humans. They were the reasons we will today.
2:59 it's insight, not incite. Sorry to nitpick.
Further INCITE into the cause of death? ... ?
1:10 black luigi is a farmer
Why do we get scared?
It does not sound good because the flowers will die
No bugs means no spiders. Cool with me! 😂
IM FROM SOUTH AFRICA AND I DIDNT KNOW THAT!
What happened if u get sunk in a quicksand
So they only want me for my bones? I thought we had something _special_
Then I would die... Im a sentient giant insect :((
Am I the only one who noticed INCITE?\nThat's lack of insight right there.
The only bugs i want to be extincted are:mosquitoes and justin bieber
WHAT DO U SEE AT 1:37 WITH BANANA CORN AND ORANGE A DIC.....?!SORRY MY BAD
Why do we humans have deja vu?? It been bothering me because I've been having them 2 times every month. Do us humans see in the future??? (0_0)
Although we hate these bugs. But its very important in opposite
Some bugs can help plants clean their leaf and soil
Can you make Best countrys to be in if all ice on earth melts just wondering.
...further incite...\nDon't you mean 'insight'...?
This comment will get 100 likes
Life noggin, what if you could drink anything BUT water!
Some bugs can stay but not a roach, those living shits can burn in hell. It’s even scarier when it flies 🤢

YAY! No more software bugs. Lol
If all spiders died
02:57 - error, should be insight
NOOOOOO NOT POTATOES
Today alone when i was setting up my halloween decorations one of my tombstones had a million ants on it, along with that i found 2 WHITE CATAPILLARS you know the poison ones. TWO!!! I also found a smaller mustard color catapillar. I screamed so much today 😂 also i cant step on an ant because i would feel so bad! I can never do it knowingly. 🐛🦋🐞🐝🐜🕷🕸🦂
Dude most of us know the benefit of insects ( mainly bees ), our problems are with cockroaches & mosquitoes & whether their good's out weight their bad's.
2:59 Life Noggin, you misspelled “Insight”. Correct the change if you can :)
i hate mosquito bite i always got bite from mosquito

Any other straight guys who love them as well!??✊✊
Like 30 hours after posting and it's still #39 on trending!
SCOTT YOU HAVE NEVER LOOKED MORE ATTRACTIVE 😍😍😍
I needed a song to do me like Bad 4 Us did... And you delivered. You deserve more recognition, gentlemen. 💙
I try but I can't deny this music video 🎶 \n\nNo seriously I've watched this at least 30 times already
Hit repeat, let's go\ndon't gotta tell me twice
Their voices are so great together!!!!!!!
OK I HAVE A THEORY\nSo it first shows Mitch shutting the door on Scott and he looks pretty fucking pissed, but as Scott drives away he starts having a lot of regret and he sees Scott wherever he goes. THIS COULD BE HOW WHEN THEY BROKE UP MITCH WAS HAVING A LOT OF REGRET AND HE DIDN’T WANT TO HURT SCOTT. But he did and now he sees him everywhere like he is haunting Mitch.
MY BOYS ARE TRENDING
Honestly though, who could deny Scott?
I want to know what Mitch does when he leaves the frame at the end. Does he go to Scott's car or does he ignore him ughhhhh 😭😍😭
This is so freakin good omfg? Who is this group? Why haven't I heard of them before?? I'm definitely stanning
Do me a favor and stop playing with my emotions.. Thanks.
I love this fucking song.
This is probably the 180,546,235th time I've watched this music video XD IT'S SO GOOD THAT I CAN'T STOP WATCHING IT!!!
OMGG I REMBEMBER WHEN THEY RECORDED THE HARMONIES FOR THIS IT WAS ON SCOTTS IG STORIE
Breaks me to break you
It HURTS me, to HURT you~\n*Dies a little inside*
Mitch's look is so 60's....love this new vid!
Love it... I could be wrong but I see it as being about not sharing the same feelings and arguing about it over and over with a person until you stop talking because nothing can change how they feel and one person needs space and then the other person loses a friend- that no amount of talking can change the facts. You're forced to choose between pretending to feel something and having your friend or telling the truth and losing a friend. And then you have this void and you can't stop thinking about the person you've lost and you realize what a big part of your life they were. Sad to see them sad but great video for a great song!
they tried to contain the scömìche but they just can't deny
I love this song so much HOLY FUCK! YASSSSSS
Favorite song on the album. Fabulous video.
While everyone else is swooning over all the brooding looks, I'm sitting here wondering how many takes this took because they kept giggling when it was time to get serious. Great job though guys!
Can stop looking at this video it is well done
Waiting for mitch to shave his mustache like😫
Living for my queens! 👸 👸
I clicked on the video because the groups name is super fruit. Now I know why.
All of their last songs should be mitch grassi- song title ft. scott \nCuz all i hear is mitch

It is impossible to escape the claim Jesus was making. Clearly, He was claiming to be God!
I am living for Mitch's 1970's porn star realness. He works that stache.
holy crap!!! this video gave me goosebumps. best music video i’ve ever seen! and such a great song
This videography is fantastic
Mitch is pulling a Freddie Mercury look
Ooooh Mitch that mustache and leather jackets a great combo
You guys are the shit
This is my new song holy SHIIIIIIT !!!
So obviously this song is about Scott from Mitch's point of view. It makes me wonder if Mitch wrote the song sang it for Scott and if Scott cried
This song is HOT
Goodbye from lonely better be a fucking sequel to this
Im srry but I havent watched yall in a while ive been busy 😞 but I watch this and MITCH GOT A MUSTACHE
That poor costume designer that had to make Scott look so different like twelve thousand times I applaud you
does anyone know how they softened the first couple electronic tones at the beginning (the ones that continued underlying throughout the song) , and added those crackles at the start; those were nice
Mitch has got a Freddie Mercury vibe going on here.
this vid brought me back to life
But can we get these Super Fruit dates though. 😉 feel like I literally know all the songs and wanna be around people know them too. Lol.
I ALMOST CRIED BC SCOTTTTTT IS SO FU🍓🍓ING HANDSOME 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 WHY ARE THEY TRING TO KILL US! MY SCÖMÌCHE HEART ALMOST HAD A HEARTATTACK
the color scheme of this video is everything
I always think that I won't like their songs bc I don't really like pop but end up loving them.
Everyone! This whole album is 🔥!! You are missing out if yoy haven't gotte your copy. Please Start requesting that these songs be played at your local radio stations. Show superfruit love for all their hard work. This whole project gives me life!!🙌😍
come to Portugal already <3
Deny U!? My favorite song of the album  , i'm so happy that they make a music vídeo of this soooong #ladenegada
Freddy mercury came back to life?????
My wig has been snatched after watching this
YAY this is trending!! \n\nAnd deserves it to!!
This song and video are FIRE!!! I love it! I've been listening to it on repeat!
Scott is so unbelievably attractive in this video. I keep watching this again and again.
This song is amazing! 🙌🏼😍
Alternate video title: Scott gets cloned and confuses the heck out of Mitch. XD
The best video y'all have released so far!! So dope
wish scotts vocals werent so quiet all the time
OK so I LOVE Superfruit (I've watched them since their first video) and I freaking LOVE Future Friends but is it just me or is Mitch way more highlighted in this album then Scott? like this song is basically  a solo Mitch song with Scott doing background vocals, and in the music video Mitch is protagonist of the story', And there is like no Scott leading songs on the album.  Do you see where I'm going? I hope I'm not alone at this XD
i love the song!!
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!! The song, the video.... you both look amazing! WOW
YES YES FUCK YES 😭  Scömíche needs to be real😢
Okay, but WHY does this remind me of the Lock and Key fanfiction?????
I read this like denny u and I was like denny who? Then my dislexic ass remindered I can't read and realized it deny u
I was devastated when Avi left pentatonix but SUPERFRUIT brought me back to life✨♥️ ilovethissong

I would want to ser Scott more in front and not so much backup. Love their music.
Are all there songs about homosexual sex where they put their penis in their anus
Rip Pentatonix
Mitch looks like a rapist
HAHAHAHAHA\nGAY
When did Superfruit become Mitch feat. Scott?
What does u mean?
And AGAIN you can tell me about fcking harmony but wtf I NEED to hear some Scott voice \nI love Mitch I really do but this is superfruit not mitchyfruit
I must have really pointy elbows as well, this was typed with my elbows as well
Where's cole \nProbs at set for a bother show
wow fuck they all look so good
WHERE IS MY COLE
I can't believe Ashleigh is almost 30
He said five me m'y Phone its GIVE ME MY PHONE PLEASE
LOVE THE SHOW HOPE THERE IS 10 SEASON LIKE FRIENDS
I love KJ's accent. It's so attractive and unique.
But why tf is Cole not here? ...Don't hate on me I'm just at the beginning of the video and wondering
It's so weird to hear KJ talk with his real accent
Does anyone know where Lilli's pants are from?
So many ppl ship Kj and lili after this 😂❤️
They all sound like their characters
Truth or dare ????? Just typed that with my elbow 😂
I love you but you're heavy 😂😂😂
Am I the only one who was excited about Riverdale because I love reading the comic books?
I love this cast so much, x\nMissed Cole there though
I feel so bad that no one asked Cami truth or dare but that one time
4:47 look at Ashleigh & Lili 😦 is she like feeling the fabric or something?
6:17 when KJ said The last text we sent? I died!
Is it just me or dose KJ sound different compared to on riverdale acting as Archie??
I uploaded a video about everything you need to know about season 2, go check it out! 😃
anyone know where cami's outfit is from?
Why has nobody commented on the amazing aesthetic / styling?!! It is on point!! 👏🏼👏🏼
Did anyone else think that when they were all on the couch, it looked like the friends opening 😂
I'm surprised teen vogue didn't disable the comments. You all are some ignorant dumb asses. First of all, just enjoy the cute interview of the riverdale cast hanging out because they are all FRIENDS. No one is dating anyone. KJ isn't dating Camila or Lili. Cole and Lili are not even together. If you ship someone that's awesome but don't bring it up on here.
This is so funny
When you thought she was going to say  2 minutes but it turned into hours 😂
I’m excuse me where’s cole
Why isn't Cole sprouse (jug head) in here
i love how lili quickly thought of kj to dance with ugh my barchie feels yes i ship them i would love to see something happen between them
They remind me of the cast from Friends for some reason😍😊
This was so aesthetic I can not
Where the fuck is Cole?
Love this lol typing this with elbow 💀 did anyone else try this
Lilly‘s pants are really ugly
I'm sorry Cole Sprouse, but I like KJ and Lili better
When Madeline said Rocketpower that's me
but can we talk about their outfits? i love this theme!
No one gonna talk about Cole not being here???
where the frick is cole?
ahaha kj do u even date - tru tho cos he's a christian - yeh up jesus
Where the fuck is cole 😐😐
why did it take me so long to realize that COLE ISNT IN THIS
Did anyone notice when Kj got  the dare about the date Lili said do you even date? and Mads nudged her and then Casey says i've seen it and then Casey whispers Cami and Kj laughed and looked at Cami
I love them so much
RIVERDALE'S CAST IS THE BEST CAST EVER! I LOVE THEM SO MUCH! BUT WHERE IS MY BOY COLE!?💜
I love that they all colour co-ordinate with each other with the pale pink and brown tones
i wonder if lili would have picked cole if he was there😏
Am i the only who wishes that Cole was here too? \nAnd Mads impersonation was spot on. I love them all.
Why is Cole not there?
Truth or dare?? \n\n\n\n\n\n i just wrote with My elbow😂

#TWICE SUPER talented group😘
다현♥
no 2ne1 no blackpink\n:D
Fighting once, ignore those non brain.
GUYS PLS STOP THIS FANWAR PLEASE ! \nokay.. so you guys said that they copied BP AIIYL dance moves , but basically , BP copied Twice DO IT AGAIN . but a lot of Kpop groups have done the move but you guys only said TWICE COPIED IT ? THAT MAKES NO SENSE ?! AND WHAT'S WITH THE DISLIKES ?! THEY SLAYED THIS SONG ! I'm really disappointed in Blinks 😢\nAND OMG THE VISUALS😍😍
TWICE BE SO AMAZING OTHERS GET JELLY JELLY! 🙈😂
sometimes when american artist sings they have these background voices (choir like) but i really cant hear their real voices here tbh. smh
since twice already 'copied' blackpink... can blackpink also copy twice when it comes to selling albums in japan it seems that blackpink aren't selling that much ♡
This mv already make the childish fandom choke...I can't imagine once they sales the song....
what a surprise for once.... stay streaming guys!!!...\n.\nbtw...\n.\nfor those BLACKhearted BLACKpink fans, are just becuz the hand move of this choreography is same of the BLACKpink AIIYL choreography... so you want to create the 3rd world war... DUHH!! please stop embarassing the other BLINKS with your wiseless brain and unmatured comment... i say like this because I am also a ONCE, BLINKS, ARMY, BUDDY and REVELUV... so please, enjoy this and stop doing fanwars ;) ;) ;) <3 <3 <3
one more time no
EVERYONE HEAR THIS!!!\nSEE 2:34 AND 2:51 WHAT DIFFERENT!!!\nNAYEON SHOES \nPLEASE REPLY
forever a tinkerbell and a once ❤💪
I don't why some of the people dislike this...
I feel like they're concepts are getting repetitive now
Okay let's get this straight. \n*that fandom* \nDon't ever argue saying this is social media, we are allowed to blah blah blah cause excuse me dear what world are you living in 2010? This is 2017 people! And it's the kpop industry! Y'all know how much shit happens when fandoms come in other groups' videos & say shit or even just give a simple question, opinion, or criticism to that group is the start of any petty war. This is fucking 2017! Fans get triggered easily so y'all better refrain yourself from coming here where you should've just ignore it & support your faves alone. Don't get yourselves involved. And DON'T COME HERE JUST TO LOOK AT THE COMMENT SECTION & WHEN YOUR GROUP IS MENTIONED Y'ALL START COMPARING, INSULTING, CRITICIZING, COMPLAINING & QUESTIONING THEM CAUSE THIS AIN'T YOUR BUSINESS WHY COME HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE? Obviously in this gen, fandoms have that kind of rule already, it's not 2010 where all fandoms are friendly & unsensitive with things, & y'all should know that better than I do. \n\nTwo options:\nSupport them\nOr\nLeave them
GO ONCE LET US SUPPORT TWICE💕ONE IN A MILLION😙
Twice is next to Girls Generation and etc. as the Asia's no 1 girl group
gonna replay it one more time 🤗
Am I the only one that keeps hearing Jeongyeon sing “Baby your birthday’s gonna be alright” haha 😂😂😵
one more time OH OH
Where are Sana's lines? :/
As they say, Blinks, so *won’t you set us free?*
When you just realize that Tzuyu is a Korean idol from Taiwan who sings in Japanese.
Let's make it 10M everyone!! Are you w/me!?
Their songs are always so catchy😍
Rap line is shining in this song\n\nAlso that part wherein they are holding instruments\n\nmight also be a hint of band concept comeback e.g. Wonder Girls\n\nDark Colored Clothes and hair?\n\nmaybe they are hinting for a Girl Crush/ Dark Concept in the future\n\nDark Concepts are always prevalent to have Powerful Dance Breaks -> J Trinity\n\nVocal Notes for emotional Impact -> Vocal Line\n\nRap Verses for more darker story -> Rap Line\n\nand with the visuals damn they will slay dark gril crush concept\n\nHwaiting \n\nALL MV Project Onces Korean <-> Japanese\n\nstream more ONCE\n\n#onceTwiceTheory
İ love twice💘twice is the best💕i will support and respect forever💪🏻
Their bubbly lovely character made they really likeable...haters just minority, they just speak louder behind screen.
🌷🌷🌷🌷One more time  Twice🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷
I think many blinks hate twice and unliked twice mv😖
Sana looks so pretty with her pink dress😍\nothers are soo cute too..lol.😗😗
These girls really serious in japan promotion...mv, song, side track, just for Japan once..
6790006 views😍😍The next target :10000000
WHO WANTS TO STREAM THIS ALL THE WAY TO 10Million ✨👍
no hate but i'm still dreaming and wishing that they would do a sexy or drama concept. A bit like Ooh Ahh.
I've been a fan of JPop as well, they incorporated it very well... I mean Perfectly. <3
help i've listened to this song at least 10x in a row 😭 this song was daebak ❤❤❤❤❤
TWICE took all over JAPAN ....
Tyuzu the cruel maknae..😂😂😂be careful when she judge you
低評価みたら、昨日は2万だったのに3万に増えてる一体誰がそんなに推してるのかね
とんでもなく可愛い！！！\n本当にいい曲だな！
なんかダサくない？\nTWICEが日本にいるとき本来のTWICEらしさが出てない気がする。
Twice曲をあげてるコメ欄でここまで日本人がコメントしてるのは始めてみた。
Shut up stupid blinks!
I watch dance version, seriously daebakkkkk

Dahyun is so cute😍😍
See this is why I don't wanna say I'm a fan of black pink the blinks are to much
Plagiat koreografi black pink :P
THIS MV NOT COPYING BLACKPINK !!!\n\nBCOZ\nBLACKPINK BETTER THEN THIS ! \n🤗🤗🤗
Blinks never complain about all the scenes in this MV. We just want to say that some dance some moves are similar with BP’s music video!!! We just show our opinions!!! The comments section is made for us show our opinions! What about Once said Pristin or others groups copying Twice! Once can say Blinks and others fandoms can say too
you will automaticly listen this song ONE MORE TIME..
Remeber nayeon is best friends with Jisoo and Jennie \nChaeyoung is close with Rose\nMina is close with Lisa\nBlinks just stop saying Twice copied BP
YALL HELP MY CHANNEL REACH 10 SUBS SO I CAN MAKE MY FRIENDS REACT TO TWICE
Please korean ONCE support this video,TWICE need more support,then can  become the best
For immature fandom think that TWICE copy Bp dance, it is not TWICE who create that dance. Dance doesn't have copyright shit like song LOL. Fucking immature fandom bitches
Is this Japanese language?? Just asking
So bad\n😱😱😱
신곡이예요?

the world needs us. our time is now to make that change <3 i love you all Today and everday I challenge you in the mist of hard times. to love stronger and harder. The world needs it more then ever right now. Shut off the news, put down the phone, tune out, to tune in. The only way we can fight these forces is with love. Do something for someone else today, big or small it doesn't matter. A simple positive change is a change in the right direction. I'm here for you, you are not alone in this world. We are all in this together, so its time we start acting like it <3 i love you all, have a blessed day hug the ones you love a lil tighter and smile at strangers. stay humble be blessed. <3 i believe in the good things coming <3 one day one day even to those who hate me everyones that done me wrong thank you Thank you for helpin me grow aand love myself even more♡♡ either a lesson or a blessing i have no time for hate cuz i'm to busy loving the people around you know we really can do so muuuch with so little if we all just learned to love and accecpt. sometimes you gotta accecpt things you cant change, and hey thats alright cuz your still beautiful on the inside you where born a star! <3
So moving, totally resonate with this. You can just feel the energy through the music
thank you for this beautiful song Nahko Bear 😍 and the video music with Paris Jackson, awesome!!
all this is very beautiful video with Paris Jackson very beautiful soul and much so the queen and I really appreciate her showing her real personality she is a Sweet Soul that just wants to love just like her father
Wow! What a beautiful song! And Paris Jackson moves fantastically!
Paris is playing this 😍❤❤
Blessings from Belgium. Paris was perfect for this video, great job brother bear!
Here for Paris my beautiful sunshine ♡
Paris is so beautiful omg❤
So delicate and inspiring.\nAll the nature and the human connected.  Beautiful.
This video is very simple and yet so meaningful, it manages to perfectly capture a feeling of finding your place in life, being part of nature and the universe, being free and living life with all its joys and sorrows. And Paris is a beautiful human being and such a talented actress, just look at how expressive and fluid her movement is when she is dancing!
thank you so much.. I'm almost in tears its like... I see poetry and beauty only, this song is inspiring.. Paris jackson is  so full of light.  I'm in love for the art of life.
To the Few people who are commenting a Dislike on this song.  Keep in mind that it is a song Nahko wrote a long time ago.  This song is not indicative of where his Sound is moving too.  Nahko chose this song because it reminded him of his Friend - Paris Jackson and he wanted to capture her Pure and Natural Beauty and Inner Essence.  I Think Nahko and Crew did a Fantastic job in this..  Paris has a You Tube Channel.. You can see what she is really like.  A very down to earth young lady with a sweet soul.   I expect we will hear much more of Nahko and MFTP music that we will love as much as the other songs now and in the future 💗
I've been away from nahko's music for a little now, maybe two weeks since i heard a song? But i was drawn to search for him today, just after a new song was released. Spooky!
I dont even understand why tears welled up and why I find this so emotional but its a great video. I love his eye.
Finally..I have been waiting for this video..Paris Jackson..WOW .She is such an amazing women..Mike is so...Proud of u babygirl😙😙😙😙
Beautiful mix of her mother and father
I love this song. Especially the meaning behind it xxx
Vim pela a Paris
Great job.... Good music & video 🙏
Mmm right in the feels, but I'm feeling strong and unified. ❤
Paris❤
awesome MUSIC video !!!
Very cool, indeed! Beautiful!
Jackson❤

This is medicine. It couldn't be more perfect. Thank you. See you in Bristol. Much love <3
Great video!! Paris is beautiful, I love her so much! 😘😍💖✨
me hear before 1000.000.000 views
sososooo beautiful, music and words and pictures ... thank you!
I like Paris Jackson (Michael Jackson's daughter) in this music video. She is a pretty girl. This was a good music video and a good song. Very relaxing. You can play this at work or in your car on the way to work to calm and center yourself. I am a music lover...trust me this is a good song. Also I heard influences 100% of The Dave Matthews Band...instantly...the voice is very much similar to Dave Mathews voice! Not bad...if your gonna be influenced by someone then let it be one of the best bands out there.
Such a good song
This is incredible, Paris really is something else. Such a beautiful music video 💛
Love always!
Paris is so beautiful ♥ i love her.
Medicine
To the few dislikers..Find your medicine and use it. \nLove this song and new video Nahko. A true blessing to see Paris beautifully happy. So inspired. Thank you for sharing your music and the message. Much Love
A R T
see ya on the 28th in the Chi!
hello medicine tribe!  so glad to be a part of this movement as we usher in a new time and paradigm for a new generation..  Love you all!  Blessings of light on your paths.  Love you Nahkz! Thank you for the medicine.  You are such a powerful catalyst for change and a great healer.
:) Nahko you never disappoint me.\nSuch a beautiful song and such a beautiful video.\n\nI love you guys. All of you ♥
This is such a beautiful song as as well as video, and it is mainly or partially due because of Nahko Bear. And of course  the other part of thee success of this video as well as song, being his producer or his producers.
my dream is to collaborate a song with you. hope to one day make that possible.
Thinkyouknowmusic on Twitter brought me here.
i'm in love
I need some medicine right now. Active shooter 3 miles from my home tonight... two weeks ago there was one on the exit my fiancee takes to work...  why is everything so crazy?
Beatiful
You're music is a true inspiration
Finally some new medicine 😁
love this so much
This video is so  nature. I loved the part in what Paris closed her eyes in front of the tree ❤ OMG im in love with nature

Nahko! Thank you for shining. We see you, brother Bear. Mahalo

This is beautiful, the message is so empowering! I'm so grateful for these human beings! ♡♡♡
A survivors song.....thank you! Strength given and recieved <3
Loved it
I'm looking forward to the new album !!! Since I started listening to this group, it seems a lie, but my life changed. I have learned new things with each of their songs, they have helped me to overcome very bad moments, they have helped me to learn things, to make my life different otherwise ... Thank you very much for being there, Nahko and Medicine for the People\n\nRegarding this song, I love it, it's beautiful. I liked that someone explained to me a little what he understood with the lyrics of the song, because to this day, I'm not very clear about its meaning.\n\nThank you!\n\nMuch love and respect for all! : D
Beautiful video! Thank you!
Beautiful, thank you

La copia barata de The Scientist, pero con la sucia de Paris Jackson.
VEGANS save lives❤ \nI love you nahko😙😑😙
Why  not run the video in forward motion?
Paris is the beauty of nature personified
I think the quality of Nahko's music is inversely proportional to the amount of tattoos he gets on his head.  Sorry not sorry
Paris Jackson is so beautiful.😍 Song is boring & music video was so boring.😞
did the band break up?
Speechless.. an amazing song and very emotional the video.. i don't have enough words to explain how much i'm proud of you Paris...  your daddy is so proud of you.. thank you for everything.. a big hug♡
Whats the name of that dancing yoga practice that i see in almost all your videos ?
Its so funny when they sit and stand up but the only one that fall is edwin 😂💘
Damn they are so energetic
I’m obsessed with this songggggg gosh IM LOVIN IT❤️
I can't even... I'm speechless. This is art and talent.
i broke the replay button lol
Popsocketsisfun.com has free stuff better cop
2:42 when prettymuch drops a new song

When it's only 20 seconds in and u add it to ur favorites
WHO KNEW I COULD SMILE FOR A WHOLE 3 MINUTES AND 15 SECONDS ALL BECAUSE A BUNCH OF GUYS JUMPING AROUND AND A TRAFFIC CONE
My favorite singer is\n1.Brandon\n2.Austin\n3.Nick\n4.Zion\nAnd the other one
Nick 😍😍 since he was part of the iconic boys in America's Best Dance Crew !
I swear Austin was on something when filming this 😂😂😂😂💜
I can literally watch this all day. YES!
I never knew how much I really needed this song before now
zion and edwin looking fine as fuck im wigless

this is very budget
Currently in my kitchen jamming along as if I was in the video while waiting for pizza 💃🏻😂
I can't handle this. Too many good looking creatures in one video.
This video is so authentic and I love that they were just having fun. I dig it 💕
ANYONE ELSE NOTICE BRANDON DID A CARTWHEEL AT 2:21 🤷🏽‍♀️
It's impossible to make good screenshots lol
For some reason I love 1:39
The blond guy reminds me of Seventeen's Vernon and I've got no idea why\n\nGood song, though. You've made me a tentative fan.
I'm too into this band already. Too deep man, too deep
omg i can't believe i'm going to be in love with another group help me
I love their energy,  vibe , everything just 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I love how Austin just starts using the cone😂
they really gotta be moving my baby edwin out of the shot
There's like *NSYNC 1d mixed together
They can all dance❤️🔥\nthey can sing🙌🏼😍\nthey cute😍😍😍 ....one direction who?😭😫😫❤️
This is so cute; pure love & energy
I Love Zion But Come On Guys You Gotta Admit It They're All Perfect .. 😍😍😍😍😍
So is no one going to talk about Brandon's cartwheel at 2:21??
are we not going to talk about how this was filmed all at once what tHESE MEN
AUSTIN'S SOLO HAD ME SHOOK!
The one with the hair looks like Cameron boyce
Ok why isn’t this song popular yet tho?

Im in love for this!
U can be my b...........
GET THE FUK AWAY FROM ME AUSTIN GOT LINES IM
Here before they blow up 💞😏😛
I subscribed I love y'all songs💖
I feel like Brandon was high at when they shot this
honestly hope they become more popular, i'm not really into boy groups, but they're killing it with their style
I have 3 new husbands. Zion Brandon and Edwin like <3
Gostei de vocês, e aí, como a gente faz?
WHY TF IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT ZION AND EDWIN‘S HOTNESS?!?!?!

Lmao my student council teacher  this is her nephew *the one in the white shirt*
what the fandom name? im apart of it as of now
In case you plan to breastfeed you are also not supposed to used retinol when nursing :(
I love Tartelette palette 🎨 so stunning. Very similar colours to Too Faced Chocolate 🍫 palette👌🏻
The Tartlette Toasted Palette is a must for christmas gifts. Loving the Paris book also....such an amazing  idea.  Is there one for London also? That would make a great gift as well.  Thanks for sharing your New in Beauty with us!
Really interested in seeing a review of that Lancôme stick foundation!
So is this the old formula? And it's only available in the USA? It's a little different name, SPF 21, and shade range is different from the U.K.  I wear 110 in the one available in the USA but that's a shade too dark. Here is the link to the USA one I'm referring to (please someone let me know if this is different from the new UK release!!). https://www.lancome-usa.com/makeup/face/foundation/teint-idole-ultra-longwear-foundation-stick/3605971343964.html

Thanks for posting Paty InStyle-Decor Luxury Lifestyle http://instyle-decor.com Beverly Hills
Wow! That estee lauder box looks amazing!
Fleur😍😍😍😍😍
SERIOUSLY NEED THE NEW TARTE PALETTE😍😍😍😍🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
You are looking beautiful Fleur!
lol be these videos Fleur!! ❤️
These vids are my fave x
Your under eye concealer has looked very cakey in your last few videos - what is it? 😳
Loved this video Fleur, you look absolutely glowing, pregnancy is really suiting you! I can't wait to get my hands on those serums! xx
Hi Fleur.. Love your makeup look in this video.. Do a tutorial maybe? :)
Clinique skincare is a hit IF you find the right product for your skin type. I have super dry skin (not dehydrated) and Moisture Surge Intense Skin Fortifying Hydrator for a moisturizer and All About Eyes Rich or Repairwear Anti-Gravity Eye Lift Cream for the eye area are my favorite skincare products that I've tried from the brand. I like the Dermalogica balm cleanser 10x more than Clinique's since it's in a tube and it doesn't make my vision insanely blurry like Clinique's does when I take off my eye makeup. There have been some definite misses in Clinique for me as well but the Moisture Surge Extended Thirst Relief is my ride or die moisturizer for when my skin is at its absolute driest and tightest so I would highly suggest that if you have dry/dry combo/very dry skin.
have been expecting for this video for so long!!! love your new launches video Fleur!
I love your New in Beauty`' videos. You always have the brands/stuff that others never show.
I’m not a girl but I wear makeup and I like acting like a girl! Awesome video and I love the tarte palette!
Ahhh I love your reviews! You’re quick, honest and hilarious. Excited about the ouai spray and that toasted palette- I love tarte.
Did you know the Estee box is sold out?
Could we have a best candles / Reed diffusers video. Not the Xmas candles, just a general one. Thanks
love the video - as always!! :)\nwhat about the new hourglass holiday palette? you didn't mention it in september either..
You look great in this video Fleur!!! Thanks for bringing me up to date! Lancome stick foundation seems great! Would love a more thorough review on it!
Aw, the beauty box isn't sold in the US, but all the other Estee Lauder companies pink products are :(
Remember when trying these new products out Fleur, that you are taking prenatal vitamins which are full of so much nourishment. That can contribute to your hair being so wonderful right now. Happened to me darn it.
Shut up Zoe’s friend.
That Tarte palette looks so frickin' amazing! Please do a tutorial on it x x
Hi Fleur! Since it's breast cancer awareness month, I would really love to see what you think of MÊME cosmetics, which are supposed to be formulated for women who are fighting cancer!
The Estée Lauder box is still in stock on the Clinique website!
Wow I want to try all of it! And you know me and my obsession with Tarte! ❤️Lol 😆
Always love these videos! Where are your earings from Fleur? They're lovely
your voice is the best i have ever listened to :-)
This is my favorite series of yours!
I was so happy when I discovered the Ordinary! I cannot afford fancy serums but I swear the Ordinary serums have seriously changed my skin!
Gutted to have missed out on that Breast Cancer box!!
I have yet to try The Ordinary, but the serums look promising. These overview videos are really so helpful!
Always wanted to try some Ouai products! I love the sound of them and the package is gorgeous! Definitely going to pick up some of the new ordinary stuff! I'm obsessed xox
Fleur- what are your thoughts on the new Charlotte Tilburry pallet?
Hi There Guys! This Is Awesome! I Got 𝔽𝕣𝕖𝕖 $𝟚𝟝𝟘 𝕀𝕥𝕦𝕟𝕖𝕤 ℂ𝕠𝕕𝕖𝕤 Here – >  #Claimanygiftcardfrofree
that tarte palette looks amazing! I'll have to check it out, it does look more wearable than the naked heat palette
Hope you can make a Drugstore Makeup 💄 video next. All ur videos are mostly high street and high end. 😔 thanks!
Your face is radiant as usual, Fleur. Can't wait to see how the baby will look like. It's going to have a face like a flower or like the sun. Cute!
Are you using all products during pregnancy? Or have you changed anything in your routine?
The ester lauder box is already sold out. Boo!
Well that's my Christmas list sorted! Thanks FleurB. Hope you're well x
Love watching an intelligent woman with good vocabulary playing with beautiful frivolous stuff  I'm 36 and get a headache from the omg babes channels lol .. I love that you try enough of the things to give an opinion rather than just a basic show what's out xxx
Your hair looks incredible, I definitely need to try those Ouai products!
Your videos are ALWAYS informative and fantastic!!!  P.S. Pregnancy looks great on you!! XOX
Hi Fleur, today in France, we're celebrating everyone named Fleur so happy name's day , happy Fleur's day 🎉😘 tc !
What nail polish are you wearing? 😍
Hi Fleur I really enjoyed the October update so many interesting new things. I'd love to know which of the Ouai shampoos you used and enjoyed I was about to take the plunge. Also I had read about the smoothing product you mentioned but haven't been able to find in the UK so thrilled it may now be available.
Hi fleur are you wearing maternity wear? Could you do a video on maternity wear?
Smashbox has sold out of the charity boxes on your link but Bobby Brown still has some in stock :-)
Love your top ooh new products
Your hair in this video is amazing!!!!
that brown sparkly shade in the tarte palette STRESSES ME OUT hahahah IMAGINE THE FALL OUT
The toasted looks amazing and supporting a good cause, I always love
I never realised you still made YT videos! I’ve missed them; I used to watch you way back in the day! Hey girl!
Hi Fleur, what did you think of the new Chanel perfume- Gabrielle? X
I love what you're wearing Fleur! Where is it from and can you get it non maternity? It's so cute 😊 Love your videos and hope you're enjoying your pregnancy. Can't wait for #babydeforce
You look so beautiful you are glowing 🤗😍
Love that box for breast cancer! Great idea. Another great video, Fleur :)
Love these videos Fleur, really respect your opinion and appreciate work you put in to research and try all these products out x
Fleur whats wrong with your undereye concealer, it doesnt look as good as always. Have you used another one ?
some nice looking products there
I’m looking for liquid lipstick version of mac velvet teddy that’s going to last all day. Any help??? X
I love the smelling sound not in a creepy way but its not gross....
Would love a drugstore haul for autumn /winter
Love these types of videos! Do you have any recommendations for liquid eye liner? I’m on the hunt for something new because my favourite one has been discontinued. Also, waterproof would be an amazing plus ❤️
So happy to see your video Fleur! I am in love with the Tartlette palette and the Erborian mask I'll definitely look into. (Before this vid, here I was trying to whittle down my makeup stash for some while 😂)
Love it all and you are lovely! xoxo
Love these 'new i beauty' videos☺️
Awesome idea for the breast cancer box 💕and looking forward to trying the new Ordinary serums!
Lovely choices as always, Fleur. :) Hope you're feeling well ; before you know it your Favorite Beautiful Lead Item of All Time will be ... *Baby DeForce.* :D
I am so sad the toasted palette isn’t out yet 😩 it looks amazing
I'm not loving that UD mascara either.  The Perversion mascara is one of my favorite from them, though!
The tarte palette is so beautiful😭
I am definitely going to pick up the Tarte  palette. Curious about the Eborian mask since I enjoy their BB cream. The bubble mask looks fun! What would you compare the Clinique  overnight lip balm to? Oh my gosh! Nooo replica! I adore their fragrances & I don't need to because they are pricy but that one sounds good. Beach Walk is my all time favorite scent. It's pretty much been my signature scent for the past couple of years. Hope you're having a lovely week. Hugs, Summer xo
Urghhh the breast cancer box is sold out. My mum just finished treatment a few months ago and would have loved it! Hoping they'll restock
I'm so excited and ready for the tarteltte toasted pallete 😍😍😍
i have to look for that beauty box for breast cancer, that's nice! i will look for and try the clinique double bubble mask is available in the US for $24.50
My favourite and what I look forward to most are your Vlogtober and Vlogmas vlogs. I, of course, totally understand why you are not doing them but I am still a little heartbroken. Hopefully next year.
Gutted that the breast cancer beauty box is sold out. Is it a one off or do they come back in stock?
It's a shame that the Estee Lauder box sold out in minutes! Would have liked one....
The tarte palette looks so good but idk where to buy it from in the uk
Does Tarte ship to the UK ? Or how else can we get this palette?
no shops in the UK stocks tarte make up !!!;( if anyone things i'm wrong and know the place pleat let me know!!!!) there is one place like a pharmacy and let's say for tarte eyeshadow palette charges like 149 pounds!!!????🤦🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🙄
It seems a bit odd that Replica are releasing a summer/sea scent in October...  I love the Lipstick one and By the Fireplace for winter :)
Are you a male to female transgender? Born a man?
Love your hair Fleur. The new growth looks so heathy and shiny. Natural color looks so flattering.
Loved this new-in-beauty video as always!  You always give great reviews/first impressions
Hi Fleur! Question! Where/How do you get Tarte in the UK?! Thanks for answering love! ❤
Your explanation of hair memory :) haha.
did anybody misunderstand fleur saying sweat proof as 'sex proof'??
Wear us your top from?!

Just a little tip with the coffee plunger, after you put the water in give it a quick stir and let it sit for 3 minutes with the lid on, and then plunge it down.:))

Sorry, but what are conkers?? Are they chestnuts??🌰🌰
I love watching Zoe's vlogs especially when she talks about Christmas this early because I'm the same way. I love fall and Christmas and I started listening to Christmas music in June but I have no shame.
zoe, your skin has been looking AMAZING. Have you changed your skin routine?
does everyone put milk on their scrambled eggs? that is so strange to me
When Zoe said ‘I bright this sprig because it was cute’ she looked like she was contemplating whether she really needed a sprig or any of the stuff she brought😂
Can anyone tell me if Zoe's nails are acrylic gel or stick on
love the vlog, but zoe your skin looks amazing!!!!!
Your skin looks so good!!!!
Love your dressing gown!!!
What are conkers??😂
I can’t wait until Zoe does Vlogmas again ! 😍

So excited for this time of the year!!
Your skin is gorgeous, Zoe! Lots of love xxx

I moved school today and I was quite anxious but I have a bug at the moment so I'm not feeling too good and it's only my first day! I had some not very kind girls who called me horrible things and laughed at me and were friends with me when it suited them, but Zoe u have helped me through it all. Zoe I love you the world!
Love this! I've not been having an easy time recently and this has made me feel so much better. Love you Zoë and you are gorgeous as always 😍❤
Where did she get the woodland garland from?
I enjoy your long vlogs sooo much! I love to make me some tea and snuggle up in a cozy jumper and a fuzzy blanket and just watch your vlogs!
I saw some alpro milk in the fridge!! guess it was for poppy but still! Proud haha<3
Leave it to Zoe to get everybody buzzing for Christmas 😂

WHO LIKED BEFORE WATCHING
Early squad 😙😙😙😙
aww i love Rhiannon Ashlee too
So gooood!!!! ❤️😍
my names rhiannon hahaha
I love a long zoella vlog❤❤
Happy 5-year-anniversary!! ❤️
Who is excited for vlogmas 🎉🎉❄️❄️❄️❄️
Its not autumn without zoes autumn videos
Im waiting for a Zark vlog😅💗
Your skin looks amazing 💕💕💕💕💕💕
as zoe was talking about the coffees and said they go out of date i was drinking tea then checked when it goes out of date and it went out of date in February, great!
Your coffee might not be turning out so great because it is ground too fine. A french press needs a super coarse grind. Try using a pour over or something with a paper/cloth filter. Your coffee would taste much better! ^_^
You should def do a rly colorful tree, a neutral/ silver and gold tree, defff a red and gold, and omg I'm so excited!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️
EEEK!im literally jumping up and down I always get exited for her vlogs I hope she goes into a vlogging  streek
A good tip for scrambled eggs is to add parsley and Parmesan into the eggs. Sounds weird ish but tastes amazing!! Ily xx
I'm so ready for Christmas 🎄
I’ve been excited for this video since your last vlog 😂❤️
It’s getting close to Xmas yippie   Xx
I love your Autumn videos :)
Narla makes me laugh so much 😂😂😂❤️
Is the conker thing a British thing? I have no idea what those are lol
MAJOR Mr G vibes lol
HANDMAIDS TALE OMG YESSSS <3

Monstober could never
He stole spook tober from me, sueing
handmaids tale I'm dead

DEAR EVAN HANSEN OMG I LOVE
Can you collab with Shane
Imma be Ruth Bader Ginsburg my iconic QUEEN
I saw Dear Evan Hansen\n\n\n\n\nI clicked
I SEE TRONNOR I'M FREAKING OUT!!!!
la croix im dead😂😂
Yasss henny with that Cameron Dallas Grindr shade <3
OMG YESSSSSS!!!!!
DEAR EVAN HANSEN OH MY BROADWAY LORDS ABOVE
THE GRINDR HOMESCREEN COSTUME BEATS THEM ALL
4:01 stOP IT, lmao
DearEvenHanson
tyLER OMFG
Dear Evan Hansen ahhhhhh
1:28 OMG THE PITCH PERFECT NERD 🤓
SPOOKTOBER😆!!!!!
I saw Troye😏😏😂😍 #troyler
Michael Mell ❤️❤️
OMG TYLER I DIDNT KNOW U LIKE DEH!!!
Dear Evan Hansen, you make me emotional
DEAR EVAN HANSEN
3:52 SHANEEEEE
Oh my god! He took DIYing to the complete next level! This is the first vid I have seen of his and I'm shook at how authentic each outfit was!!💙 These were sooo goood💕✨👍
the way tyler said pamplemousse left me in tears
I'm being a gender bent Jughead! Also this video was so cute! The Grinder one killed me!
troye's on the last row bc he's a bottom i lov
I relate on a spiritual level to the DEH costume
So I live close to the second biggest gayborhood in the USA, and they throw a huge street party every year. I've never gone, but hoping to this year. The theme is heroes and icons, and because I am all for covering every inch of skin, I'm rocking the homemade suit from Spiderman Homecoming. Because despite being 30 in November, everyone thinks I'm like 12.
The Handmaid's Tale is a super incredible show based on the novel by Margret Atwood. It takes place in a dystopian future in which fertility is at an all-time low and nations are struggling because of it. A Christianity- oriented cult/organization takes over part of the US and enslaves fertile women in an attempt to increase the population. Obviously it feels a bit relevant right now.
it makes me so happy when other people know deh
good luck with your lives bye
I'm a simple thespian. I see deh, I click.
okay where’d u get that cast doe..... i’m going as eddie from It and i need the cast lmao
Damn, I wish my Grindr homepage had that many good-looking men.
where do you get the evan hansen shirt?
Come through with that DEH costume!!!!!!!!!!
Holy crapoly I've been away from Ty for a few years.   He...he....he has...muscles.  \n\nNice.
bitch you did just that \nthe grindr costume tho, I found what to wear for my wedding
My costume will be a male sacrificial virgin.
A fox  or LA CROIX ! for sure!
Grindr screen is the most creative thing I ever seen
i'm not trying to be too sensitive or whatever but i don't know if it's all that fun to dress as a handmaid... they're sex slaves. i just don't know if it's cool for guys to dress as women who slaves, even if it's based on fiction... if you watch or read the story, i don't think you'll find it super kosher either
WHERE DO U GET THE DEH SHIRT
@Tyler Oakley, you should try the Key Lime La Croix! It is magical~!!
What the hell Tyler used to get like at least a mil views and now it's gone down. Why!?!?
What are these handmaids? And what are their tales? Honestly I have the same questions.
e v a n i m s h o o k
Don't watch The Handmaid's Tail, I hated it! lol
I am Now being Evan Hansen for Halloween
TYLER YOU STOLE MY IDEA FOR EVAN- AND WHERE DO YOU GET THE SHIRT
the real spookiness of the handmaid's tales is how the state of politics in america may very well head down the path to make it a reality if the people dont act and speak out
(continue the chain) DEAR EVAN HANSEN...
I’m flying over from The Netherlands to Birmingham for the show on Sunday because i’m that excited to see you 😊
can we not turn a political statement into a halloween costume :)
I can’t wait to see Tyler at hello world 😁
Not trying to be rude, but why is Tyler's views going down?
Omg. Wanna go to hello world so bad but it’s really expensive
You are too cute for words
Are you still a one direction fan?
I’m being Tyler Joseph from twenty one pilots
My man let me tell you how good handmades tale is it had me all kinds of messed up I’m an analytical person and boy was I going through a lot watching that show I think you’d enjoy it. Wrapping it up ok I like the creative stuff and how you can diy it and make it great okay later ✌️
My boyfriend and I are going to be danny phantom and Sam Manson  (:
i might be michael mell for halloween
Where did you get the shirt for the Evan Hansen costume? Also, how did you make the cast?
i saw evan hansen and i clicked so fast
I DIED AT THE GRINDR SCREEN
Handmaide s tale is a bizarre story. There are woman who have to be breeding stock for like the good chistions. They wear red clothing. You should watch it. Its so surreal.
I would be tyler joseph IF WE CELEBRATED HALLOWEEN WHERE I LIVE😑😩
Where can you get the dear evan hansen polo?????
Is tyler gonna dye his hair again? It's perfect either way but I just wanna know
YES HALLOWEEN *chest bumps pumpkin*
Damn his channel is dying, hope he saved his money.
WHERE DO I GET THE POLO
when did Tyler go from such a baby spice to such a sporty spice, dem arms tho 💪🏼
Halloween is lke gay christmas cuz you can dress like a slut... LMAO I FUCKING LOVE YOU 😂
Too tickled at the Grindr costume lol
Luvs me sum Spooktober!
Everybody screeeeeaam, Its almost halloween!!
if you have a cast , you can also be Eddie from IT and write the “Loser” with the red V into lover with that type of clothes with it
*because why the fuck not*
Why is Shane still on Tyler's grinder like ryland who (jk I love them both)
I saw the thumbnail in my suggested sidebar, and I laughed because I thought the Connor written on the cast was directed at Connor Franta for when he dislocated his shoulder. XD
THE FUCKING DEAR EVAN HANSEN ONE YES!!!
Where do you get the Evan Hansen shirt?? I've been searching!
You Will be Found
I'm going to be the phantpm of the opera and two of my friends are grouping with me as the couple in it
Its almost like Gay Christmas' I love you so much Tyler XD Im being a damn gay wolf pride child for haloween XD
This video gives me life
I’m being a cat
honestly idk about the Broadway show cuz all my mind am now is shipping tyler and conner even harder than i already am\n\nedit: the 4th look i cant im tweeting superfruit and conner rite now asdfghjk
I am going to be a Sexy Devil >:)
COLLAB WITH DAN AND PHIL

Been listening to him since reforget💕
A very potential singer. I've been noticing him since 3 years ago
who tf cares if it has that Hotline Bling vibe? \nThe song's great . that's what matters
Reminded me of late JT songs
I love love this song love it!
DUDE, if I was in my old reggae band this would've been a dope ska cover :)
I thought this was vevo
You should put subtitles on your songs 😊
Finally! You're back. <3
the taste still the same like Hotling blings - drake xD the beat especially...
Dope man. Love the beat and the lyrics.\nKeep up with this good work.
I wonder how it would be like all stripped down?  More soulful?
Lauv is in the air
His voice changes from one tone to another  and that's amazing
this song just got stuck in my head
Somedays soon when this song hits the big hit, this will be one of the soonest comments
Editing of the stair handle kinda sucked at 2:43
We need music like this on the Billboard
Damn the song and video is so simple that it's so beautiful 😍👏🏼

I knew Denzel's He Got Game 'fro would make a comeback!
I love Dankzel. Finally! A movie against all this liberal agenda bullshit! And here I thought Hollywood was forcing a liberal agenda on us.
Even denzel gets that feminist bullshit
oh hollywood ugh
Bout time this trailer dropped! Can't wait for this performance by Denzel.
Test it but not repeat ?
I know a guy who's a local pimp, can I report him to the cops for cash??
writer and director of NightCrawler, alright, i'll give it my attention.
So this is why he gained all that weight.
Anybody want Snickers
Another Oscar
Have to watch.
So this is the movie Ashton Sanders told Denzel on the red carpet of the Oscars that he was gonna do with him! Too bad Ashton had to drop out of the project :(
I LOVE MYSELF
#VamosSuscribete a mi canal  por favor plis
Looks good terrible title
Definitely will be seeing this. November is shaping up to be a good month for movies.
Denzel can play anything.Cant wait
نجمي المفضل دلزن واشنطن ، اضيفو ترجمه عربي
When Denzel goes for shots at another Oscar....I'm there for it.
Each one of us is greater than the worst thing we've ever done.
Sony Pictures Entertainment, you guys should team up with LEGO to make a LEGO GhostBusters movie for all of the long-time GhostBusters fans and all of The LEGO Movie fans out there and then make a irresistibly fun LEGO GhostBusters film franchise out of it and it'll be THE greatest film franchise Sony Pictures Entertainment has ever made in recent memory. The long-time GhostBusters fans will even say it's right up with the hit TV show, The Real GhostBusters, itself on so many possible levels. #LEGOGhostBusters
Where are the trolls? This movie looks good!
more stupid worthless niggers trying to play the victim bullshit
NO Oscar for Washington. No nomination. Nothing. This movie is awful
I have met Emre before! No noke. I went to Liverpool v Arsenal 4. March 2017. The day after I took a train from Liverpool to London. I met him on the train, he's a really Nice guy btw!
Do one with Coutinho. I like this series as release a new hip hop quiz with Sturridge, Gomez and Ox. It'll be funny.
He's just being honest. He named most Bayern players because he used to play with them and even know them in person. Indeed Bayern Munich is top 5 team in Europe so it all make sense.
shame on defender lfc
Let him go dony need him i always sell him on fifa and get loen..saul ... kimmch or renato
literally just a bayern team
In other words- Bayern
This guy is a former Bayern player. It's no surprise that half of the team are Bayern players
Yes,we are living in Ronaldo & Messi era.We must be proud of it.
Algum brasileiro q gosta do Liverpool e assiste esse canal?
And he's leaving in the summer ... Total shame to the board if he leaves
he want to bayern :) bitch
Not biased at all.
RB Philip lahm yes great banta can 😀😀😀😂😂😂 nah but being serious it will be bad to see him leave he seems so nice 👍
Jurgen is going to Bayern so is Emre Can.
Choses an ex Liverpool player and a player who wants to leave Liverpool great side🤣🤣🤣
To many Bayern players in my opinion
he just want is bayern move to be done soon
I thought this was Emre Can's dream team not the bayern starting XI
Can your one of my favourite midfielder
He has chosen players from four clubs only, namely:\n1) Bayern\n2) Liverpool\n3) Barcelona\n4) Real Madrid\nAre those his favorite clubs?
Bro he should just said Bayern
Mostly FC Bayern players!
Coutinho the best
Mignolet no goals in should surely be ahead of Neuer.
liverpool have to buy carlos lampe, bolivia goalkeeper
Looks like Emre is pushing for a move to Munich 😂😂😂
maybe a move to bayern?
People complain about Emre choosing so many Bayern players, but keep in mind, they are all some of the best in the world in their respective positions. I totally understand him.
Just gonna take a wild guess here, he wants a bayern move?
Damn. That's a good team.
This shows can have his heart on Bayern m
Frank could have been better but still good
So basically, Emre Can is joining Bayern Munich for free in the summer.
Stop making him to videos and make him sign the contract lol
Half of the players are from Bayern Munich
That would be a beast team, and suits, the big beast himself emre
He just picked all the best players
Hope he signs new contract
That is one hell of an awesome midfield Emre, glad to see you know what you're talking about.
this is just a German/Bayern hybrid
Please sign a new contract Emre!!!
KLAVAN is god. One of the best defenders in the world. He’s strong powerful great tackle. He is a proper leader and legend
Although it's mostly bayern players n players he play with it's a pretty good team☺
Stevie G providing to Ron and Messi...just imagine 😍😍
Sounds like he wants to come back to Bayern
when did he play with ramos?
I think he likes Bayern
I love you ❤️ can \nOne of the best players in the premier league
Never mind who he picks, sign a contract and focus on the games.
I'm going for…\nI'm going for…\nI'm going for…\nI'm…
He would like to sign for Bayern??
Lowkey emre wants to be in bayern again
Does Can just love Bayern, or does he just love Bayern. I think he just loves Bayern.
OK, Ronaldo's good and all, but Danny Ings??!!?!
Funny how most of the the team is munich
*Emre Can chooses his all-time eleven from the stars he's played with or against, for club and country.* , please read the description before talking trash.
He choose Cou & SG8 because he's Lfc player, if him not from this club, he's don't choose them😁👌
Steven Gerrard forever
https://youtu.be/Z5fEVzpNzcs
*Emre Can selects the Bayern Munich XI
No lovren or matip?? Really??
Too many bayern plyr
So all bayern munich players are in his dream team and his Liverpool teammates. I can understand GK position and forward but all other guys 😧😧😧
Clearly can is a Munich fan
I think Emre is eyeing a move to Bayern....
Bayern Munich!
Title is misleading, It should be Emre Can's favourite Bayern Players and some other players as well. 😂
No Toni Kroos?
Where is ox
Sign new contract!
Where's Rickie Lambert?
Too many Bayern
Sign the fucking contract.
Emre can 😳
No lord bendtner 😥😥😥🙄
Go play for Bayern jeez
To many Bayern Players
Not lovren as CB? Wtf
Where is Moreno??!!
All about Munich 😂😂
Job application to Bayern?
#KloppOut
picked half of Bayern Munich
This dude a bayern munich fan LOL
Bayern Munich Confirm
completley agrreee
ALL MUENCHEN  😂

Wie er Bayern in den Arsch kriecht.
Mo salah
RENUEVEN A EMRE HIJOS DE SU PUTA MADRE. GIVE HIM  A NEW CONTRACT  MADAFAKAS
....is this entire video a satire?
That is the same ring tone that was on the Satellite phone that was in Jurassic Park III  and was found in Dinosaur poo.
Emma dancing around and playing the Nokia ringtone was really adorable
wow I remember this sound 0:00
I'm travelling around Vietnam and I hear that ringtone everyday! Ps where's your jacket from?
did anyone not get a notif for this vid?
I used to own the Nokia 3310 as well.  You can knock someone out with it.
I'm late to this video, but omg that ringtone takes me back!
now you can do a full gameplay of snaek\n\ntwo
1:52 yes emma that is the iphone 8. No difference. So instead of giving you a real iphone 8 they gave you a phone with the exact equal functions
You where amazing at big gig
awww i remember my first phone, one of those nokias too. i hated it but like, it did work damn well
I saw you at the big gig, and you were absolutely great!!!! <3
I want to be in the early 2000's because that's when emo was more popular.
Yessssss you're chilling in Brighton Emma what a g
Hey Emma blackery I saw you live today at big gig and OMG I was one of my only people out of my pack who knew you! I love you Emma!
In a couple years i should use my iPhone 5 like when im twenty something
My first phone was nokia 5110. Damn that was at my 6th grade lol first year hs when i got a 3310. Snake and space impact ftw
My first phonebwas in 1998 and i got the Motorola Startac. Flip phone and it pre-dated these, was first phone to have text messaging. Had a green screen and the sim card was the size of a credit card.
I don't know why I was excited when Emma was doing the unboxing part
The auld Lang syne tune genuinely sounds like the bagpipes up here in Scotland on new year 😂
The sad thing about this is that the phone that is your FIRST PHONE is the most up to date phone my grandad has ever owned
I wounder why her daddy loves her, shes got a charming personality.
I called it that it would be a nokia
I wanted to see old phone not new one\nEdit: NeVeRmInD
“I’m gonna become a tech channel”\n.\n.\n.\n“I’m gonna make a gaming channel”
The chat function was for AIM!!!
I literally love Emma so much
General \nSilence \nDiscreet \n\nAh yes the three genders
I m going to see her at the big gig
I hope you didn't drop it by mistake...
this is completely unrelated to the video but where's your jacket from it's so cute
Did anybody else think that whilst she was talking about not setting off the phone in the bank that her dad on his phone in the background was gonna ring her? \n\nI’d have found that hilarious.
I'm surprised that still works considering analog vs digital technology
Are you a fan of Sonic Youth? \nThose phones are sick though.
Jaysus Emma if that airbag goes off you're going to be hurting
Emma, I'm confused... The thumbnail is you with the Nokia. The title says I used my first ever phone for a day ... Was I actually supposed to believe that there was an iPhone 8+ in that box?
Does anyone know where she got that killer denim jacket from???
Isnt that front panel supposed to come off so you can have a different colour
Comment what ringtone you had on your Nokia 3310 my was knick knack
*watches this video on my samsung* Yes. Yes I need a smart phone.
I just have to say that I love watching your videos and I was too scared to listen to your Music I was afriad that it whould wreck your videos but I absolutley love yout music aswell . Love from Sweden <3
Gonna watch you at big gig!!!! Xx
I remember my Nokia :D x
I love your dad 😂
Glad you got back to normal emma lol love u!!!!!
Omg nostalgia in the first 4 seconds! This gone be good :D
Imagine opening a box expecting an overpriced shit apple iPhone and finding a genuinely alright phone. Would rather a brick than an iPhone.
The only thing i I can see is a murder weapon
I read this as you getting a phone for the first time
3510i was my first, I was 10 and people my age were having flip up phones, camera. Now 13 years later, iPhone.
Omg the Nokia tone brings back so many memories! 💜📱
4:55 guys! she leaked music from her new ep!!!2!1!!1
You probably shouldn't stand in the middle of a bank and say I really wanna set it off in here
WE HAD THE SAME FIRST PHONE
i used to have one of those phones and i loved it
She completely ruined the joke at the beginning
Emma with every beep a past channel of yours dies and some one unsubs due to Demma I'm off to dans dieing channel
I love this lol
Why did you steal Luke's intro? Not cool Emma, not cool.
That reaction to the Nokia instead of the iphone went on for an uncomfortably long time 😂😂
You, I mean you emma, you can dye your hair what ever color, and you would still look amazing.
We now know what she uses as a vibrator
I'M ON THE PHONE!!
the first phone i got was a burner flip phone, it didnt last 2 months
I love your dad and yours relationship
I love Emma so much.
You got your first phone when you were 8 years old and ur 25?! Jeez ur family was well off, it was rare to have a phone that early when we were younger
This was my first phone too... I loved changing up the cases! My Buffy the Vampire one was my favourite 😂
Next step, make this a science channel, and test the durability of the Nokia!
No offense but I like you hair I just think You should change it to brown...\n\nThat made me sound like I hate your hair. I dont but I just think like yellow dosnt suit you 💟💫
My first phone was a vodaphone branded flipphone with butterflies on it and I used to dream it could record videos lmao
If you ever think you job is pointless, just remember they made cases for those phones lol
that ringtone is the sound my washing machine makes
You did amazing the big big today I loved all your songs
idk why but the beginning reminds me so much of jacksfilms..i like it :D
Hope u see this emma. You were great at the big gig and i loved your performance i cant believe you got to meet caspar lee!!!! I hope you enjoyed it yourself love ya x
I love this video
All these years hearing that same ringtone and I had no idea my dad had the Nokia ringtone
The first phone I ever had! I was 9 years old when I got it . This is so entertaining!
I wear I thought your dad in the background of the bank scene was totally going to call you after you just said you didn't want to set it off!
Hey emma\nI love your videos \nI saw you at the big gig\nit was amazing\nyours was  my favourite performance :)
Regular Snake was in the 3210. That was my SECOND phone. My first phone, when I was 13, was a brick like Motorola. I can't remember the model name but man was it solid. lol. I don't think I ever owned a 3310... But to be fair it was a loooong time ago. sigh.\nYou should have played the Nokia ringtone and done a Trigger Happy: ie, shouted HELLOOO?? lollol
That was also my first phone, that remembered me so much of my childhood and I'm only 16 XD
My first phone ever was a Dancall HP 2731.\nMy second phone was a Nokia 3210.
i miss lucas
Omg JEFF!\nhttps://youtu.be/gUMTX2IOFtI

Yayyyyyyy a tech channel
Kinda wish Emma stuck with veganism. 😕
Unique idea!! Havent since this before. 👌👌👌👌
Better battery life for sure or more durable. I only had to charge it once a week when I was 14, and I used to play snake on the sports bus
Blade Runner is one of my top 3 films of all time.  The sequel?  Had me close to tears how much it did the original justice.  Beautiful film.
I personally don’t need to be feed the answer, both movies give enough info to say that Deckard is a replicant.
I preferred the original film. Something for me was missing in this sequel, like an itch you can't scratch. The shorts fleshing out the history of what happened  after the original and leading up to 2049 was  more intriguing. A  story told from The Blackout would have been more compelling.
Do a spoiler review
Holy ^&*& this movie dragged for me!
Yo where's SW Rebels season 3?
Didn't like original Blade Runner at all LOVED THIS MOVIE ! This is a must see in theaters.
I think Jared Leto character is underused and underutilized. Almost useless...
Such a beautiful movie. Best movie I've seen all year. The visuals, the musical score, and the acting were flawless. Every shot of this film can be hung on a wall as an art piece. I can't wait to see it again.
This movie was terrible. Cinema Sins is gonna have an absolute field day.
Those in positions of power that don't want him to find this out.\n\nEveryone in power positions want him to find it out. His boss, and the other woman even kills men threatening him and says, go find it under her breath. You can't even give a correct synopsis and you expect to be a trusted critic calling things ass. Your reviews are ass.
Ok... Im ALL for patient pacing, and character development.... but, good God this was SLOW. 😤😤😤\n\nHowever it was visually stimulating, the IMAX sound effects were BONKERS, it was  somewhat original, and a solid sequel; the story was clever how they tied the old and new together.  Overall I'd give it a B-.    ☻
As somebody who isn't a fan of the first, I'll contribute by saying I wasn't a fan of 2049 either. Personally, the lack of any interesting characters and the pace makes them both boring as tar. But am I alone here, people that don't like the OG? Or are there people who love the OG who don't like 2049? I'm really curious to hear other people's thoughts
I saw the Final Cut version of the original Blade Runner last week at a Cinema that was showing it, I didn't like it that much, loved the acting and visually it was stunning, overall it was okay, but 2040 which I watched last night was Amazing!, I might go see it again tonight :)
It was okay.  (3 1/2 stars)\nJared Leto was more of a James Bond villain caricature and his offsider reminded me of Ivana Humpalot from Austin Powers.
It was\nOn point and I loved swing it in IMAX. They turned the volume up so high shit vibrated in the theater
I haven't seen the original, but I really liked this movie despite its slow pace. The freakin world-building and aesthetics were orgasmic... weird sex scene tho.
Felt really bland. A lot of scenes were unnecessarily long. Character development was weak. Soundtrack didn’t meet my expectations. A forgettable film that i i will never rewatch.
You disappoint me. I saw it. It sucked.
Deckard is not a replicant ffs. That's just Scott inane bullshit he came up with after the fact.
so this is a sequel to a movie i wasn't even born when it was made.. most of us
Are you going to do a spoiler review?
Jeremy is a sexy beast.
im not going to lie. i seen this movie with a few friends with absolutely no prior knowledge. i ignored all trailers and hype. in fact i wasnt going to see this movie at all. we were going to see the new IRA movie maze but missed the time. to cut to the chase i found the movie incredibly confusing very drawn out and boring AT TIMES but i think most of it just went over my head two of my friends fell asleep during it, i have to say that the directing and acting really brought the movie from a 3 to a 5 even though i hated. however i probably hated it from ignorance more than anything else. i would recommend not going into this movie without watching the first ( we werent even aware it was a sequel)
I've never watched the old Blade Runner movie at all, and did not know a thing about the old one. But I freaking love Blade Runner 2049 after watching it today
I dislike the original but will watch this one.
This movie could cut an hour off and been ok, the pacing was horrible.  It was a good time if you were drunk... yeah now it's a party.
its defiantly a true proper sequel to the original loved them both
I disagree. 10/10 for me, partly because of the pacing. It's what made certain scenes so incredibly powerful, that otherwise wouldn't have been. This movie is like a middle finger to todays fast paced, instant-gratification-like lifestyle. And that's just one aspect of the movie. Cinematography, character development, the score, the SYMBOLISM... what a masterpiece.
If you guys haven’t already, check out the blade runner anime “Blackout 2022” it plays a significant part in 2049 and it is awesome in its own right. I highly recommend you all check it out
Just saw it last night and I can easily confirm that it's Awesometacular and one of the best sequels I've ever seen.
Do i need to watch the original before i watch 2049?
I liked Blade Runner 1 but never became a hard fan. People have told me to watch it more times to truly get it. But I felt like Blade Runner 2049 really shed some new light on the old one. It made me appreciate it a lot more. It's a masterpiece.
I'm surprised by the glowing reviews.  I thought it was a valiant effort, but fell short.  It didn't look as slick as the original, and Harrison Ford  felt tacked on, as though the studio thought, if he dies during production, we have to be able to salvage the rest of the show.  I'm really not a fan of these sequels made years later, where the main character from the first essentially has a cameo at the end, which is what this was.  I would have rather seen a fresh Blade Runner story with only Ryan Gosling (and that's coming from a huge Harrison Ford fan)
just watched the movie.. didnt like it xD not a fan of first one either.. so i guess that answers that =D good review though! I have to say its well put together movie theres no denying, sure its a masterpiece, sadly not my cup of tea
Went to see BR-2049 for the second time this evening! Love this movie, but then I loved the original too...one of my top 5 favourite movies of all time (the original that is) it seemed to me though, that most of the other people in the theatre with me were not impressed and bored out of their skulls! I was expecting that though, I think you do have to be a fan of the first one and the high-brow sci-fi genre in general to get where this movie is coming from.
I liked the movie a lot especially the visual, and it makes you wonder in the movie which of the replicants or the humans have a soul...
Rachael (fake) came back, but Deckard knew she was fake.  She was killed! Both K and Deckard survived at the end! Deckard went to see his daughter at the end! In the trailer, you see that they both were being chased by REPLICANTS>
I hated original blade runner but quite enjoyed this one. Better acting, more visually satisfying, much better protagonist.
Very disappointing film. Story wasn't very interesting and doesn't go anywhere, main villain is barely in it. Stunning visuals and music though.
While this wasn’t an action movie, they definitely marketed it as one, don’t you think?
I thought the original Blade Runner was good and I understand why people like it but ultimately it wasn't for me. But this new film was definitely more my cup of tea, there were just certain things done with the plot, characters and world that resonated with me more.
Great great great movie, loved it my favorite of 2017. I do similar stuff on my channel if you want to check it out
Finally a reviewer that doesn't completely dick ride this movie
It's crap see the frist one and you seen them both. But the frist one was great.
I was bored by the original, so I have no interest in this.
Spaz editing.  Can you stop hard cutting your own review every fucking 5 seconds?
I saw it with a friend who never saw the first and she loved it.
I seriously didn't even realize that Leto played Wallace. Very good acting on his part.
I have to disagree. The 2049 can perfectly exist on it's own. In fact, the premise is told in the very few minutes.\n I was watching it with my friend who apparently hadn't seen the first movie. He enjoyed it nonetheless.
I liked it. I saw Blade Runner to prepare for this movie. It had great concepts behind it and the world was great but the main plot  and protagonist was kinda meh. Blade Runner 2049 fixes a lot of these issues. It gives more focus on the main character and the story. I will agree that the pacing was still a bit too slow, just like in the first Blade Runner. Overall, I enjoyed it.
It's been a long time since I've seen real cancer.
Overal. What happened to your hair in this video
Tbh the movie was very slow not long but slow
Wasn't a fan of the original, but I loved 2049!
Thought it was boring. Should of been shorter.
I'm not a fan of the first one, but I liked the second one.
wow. jeremy trying to swim against the stream on this one. not sure why but not impressed either actually! xD
Loved the 1st one. 2nd one was okay.
In the original movie, all replicants were deemed illegal.  In 2049, the newer models are illegal, and the older models, they're illegal.  Not sure why you couldn't have said, in 2049 all replicants are still deemed illegal.
This was made by a Blade Runner fan for Blade Runner fans.   That should tell you everything you need to know about 2049.
Just watched it with my girlfriend and she fell asleep watching the original and never got to watch it full before watching 2049. This one she was more invested in and we both loved it. I agree that both the original and 2049 have tedious pacing but the sequel was engaging enough to keep me interested.
I thought this movie was awesome. I agree that the pacing was too slow at places but I like to think it was in aid of the story telling and character development. I disagree that it didn’t have as much impact as a sci-Fi, I felt that the world was beautifully bleak and was a reflection on where the human race is potentially driving the planet. That aspect made me reflect a lot! It was weird and wonderful
I slept for 30mins after the opening 10mins of the movie
I respect the integrity to the franchise but damn did I find the first one boring back in the day, easily one I will skip.
Didn't like Blade Runner og. Really enjoyed 2049. It at least had a plot lol.
I thought the original sucked. But I loved this movie, with the caveat that it's the type movie that I will realistically only watch once due to the pacing.\n\nI will say, this movie felt just like the original - but it improved on everything to such a large degree, that it made me understand why others could have seen the original as a masterpiece. If I had watched the original in the early 80's, perhaps it would have had the same impression on me. As someone who didn't see it until 5 years ago, I honestly couldn't understand why it was such a cult classic.\n\nBut it's not just about the improvements on technology either. To be clear, even the way they explored the question of what makes someone human? was far more fascinating and emotionally compelling here then in the original.
Its not the way conventional films are made its very different. It has a gripping story with some great visuals on the settings but can be a little too dark on the visuals for me.
Honestly I enjoyed the slow pace.
lol Jared Leto was goddamn horrible in this movie, Other than that everything else was pretty great. Good thing there was like only 2 scenes with him in it.
You need a spoiler talk video. There was so many unanswered questions. Please spoiler video!
Love the review, and was absolutely entranced by the film when i got to see it. I recently created a new channel for blog/review content, and decided to start with a review of Blade Runner 2049 as well. If anyone is interested, please stop by my SPOILER FREE review and check it out! Love the reviews Jeremy!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOJBHyy_i7Y
I personally wasn't too crazy about the original movie. But I did really enjoy 2049. I cant really place my finger on exactly what makes me like the newer version more than the original but its there somewhere.
Not 3 hrs. Its runtime without credits is 2 1/2 hrs. And I loved every minute!
Saw this movie and I feel like I got mindfucked. I have no idea what happened in the movie. All I can remember are the BLARING BRRRRRR NOISES NONSTOP
Dude there's an antenna sticking out of your head.
I was disappointed. This one seems dumbed down. It doesn't make you think, it just makes you pay attention. And even then, it spoonfed information that already happened in the movie in case you forgot about it. This one was definitely given a mainstream spin for general audiences :/
first one was thirty years ago. let it be long as long as your not bored
I loved 2049 and it may be my new favorite movie. I've seen the original 2 times and am still a little unsure of what of thought of it. I like it but not sure if I love it. But 2049 captivated me like no other film has in years.
Fucking good movie! One of the best! Too bad *spoiler alert* about joi.
Probably one of the better reviews I've seen. But is this movie worth watching? I think so, but the movie has so many subplots that go NOWHERE and it makes a very simple plot very confusing... perhaps that's why, to disguise a simple plot? Seems unnecessary. I almost left the movie because it became a mess to follow, but the CGI was amazing and Harrison Ford hadn't appeared yet. Yeah, wait about two hours for that to happen.
first time iv seen a window wiper on a forehead
Honestly I wasn't a fan of the original Blade Runner, but 2049 rocked my world
Okay first of all before l get started about my review on this, l want to say that the first Blade Runner is my all-time favorite movie, it's fantastic in my eyes and a real work of art in the Sci Fi genre. As for Blade Runner 2049...I was a little disappointed. Lets go over the positives first. This movie is stunning and beautiful to look at, the cinematography is brilliant! It's truthfully mind blowing and almost worth the price of admission alone. This movie also had a lot of interesting Sci Fi elements that are new and innovative, like Ryan Gosling's holographic girlfriend. I've never seen anything quite like it, it was pretty cool. The actors were all very strong in their performances, so much so that it left me wanting more from certain characters. I really enjoyed Jared Leto's performance, he's pulls off an especially creepy and mysterious character. I wanted more Leto to be honest.\nNegatives\nThis film is slooooooooowwww and too long! And I love slow movies usually! They unnecessarily stretch scenes out to the point where you're bored....and as a BIG Blade Runner fan it pains me to say that! I'm upset actually that l felt this way about this movie. The movie has pacing issues for sure. I also found the main plot of the story a little thin, it wasn't hard to get lost in this movie and wonder where are they going with this? They tried to throw a twist in, but truthfully when the twist is unraveled or revealed I didn't care, it was underwhelming. For a movie being 2 hrs 40 mins l actually expected more out of it. Certain scenes were too long and drawn out, and other parts were sorrily lacking depth. The original Blade Runner story is way better in my opinion. Also Harrison Ford doesn't even show up until the last 40 mins and by the end of movie I thought to myself, did they even really need him? Overall the movie is OK, which again sucks for me to say, because if the pacing and story was a little bit stronger and things flowed a bit better this movie could have easily been a 10/10 for Sci Fi. To sum it all up it's a good movie with some extraordinary visuals and very cool Sci Fi technology/elements and the acting is strong, but has serious pacing problems, it's too long and the story is average. LOL the first Blade Runner has a faster pace! So to all those people who thought the first one was slow, don't even bother with this one. I would definitely watch Blade Runner 2049 again as I feel I could definitely learn new things and l want to see if my opinion changes to a more positive one. Overall my rating is a 7/10.....barely.
dude you spent like 3/4 of the video talking about how this blade runner compared / connected to the first blade runner , can you review as if this is its own movie please ? your review about the story, visual etc is not deep enough
How the fuck not awesomtsuclar wtf
This movie was BORING. Goddamn
I haaaated this movie
Good review.

no dick sucking, no ass kissing, no fake film snob vibe, just straight honest opinion. thanks!

I legit thought this movie was connected to maze runner and didnt kno it was a sequel to an older movie, never seen or heard of it and i was lost throughout this movie...so going into this movie completely blind, i thought it was ass
Overrated. Yeah I said it.  What you gonna do. 😏
Yes you can be a fan of the new one without seeing the old one. I know because I watched this movie and really enjoyed it and have never seen the original.
I am going to post some short videos on Instagram (@ChrisFixit) answering some questions like if I was able to make a U-turn instead of a K-turn now. Also I am almost at 100k followers on Instagram so be sure to follow! Once I hit 100k I am doing a giveaway of ChrisFix swag with 7,000 winners!!!

Looking forward for your Spacers video
Hey man love your videos I looked on your sight and I wanted to get some merch like the shirt and hoodie combo to rep you here in crescent City ca  but all you have was up to 2xl if their any way I can get a custom size up to 3x or 4
Why is the degrees on turning not symmetrical?\nIf one is 40 shouldnt the other be 40 too?
How to super paint your car ? :v plz make this
can you please upload more usual i have an idea how to make youre car sound cammed or add camber to the wheels\nor how to clean wheels
ok so the payment method is by credit card right
How do I get rid of rust on my car?
Getting all fancy with the camera and editing, nice!
Chris is the type of guy to use thread locker on his Toothpaste cap.
Hi Chris I was wondering if there was any possible way you can do a clutch change on a front wheel drive car I have a Mitsubishi Eclipse 2000
Hey man. Because of you i went out n bought a second daily driver. A 99 mustang V6 5 speed manual. Iv been thinking of making a youtube just to show the 4.8 swap plus more. I also went out and bought the same rims powder coated tan and still chrome on the brim and they cane with semi new toyos! The guy also had quarter inch spacers to sell with them. Lol ill try the angle mod later after i redo the whole underbody of everything.
install these space adapters on the rear wheels, just so it looks even and better.
Can you do a video on how to remove “wash me” residue from paint or at least elaborate on how to.
and I thought you discovered how to adjust the steering stops...  Tell us more about driving sideways.
I really want chris to do an engine overhaul video. Who's with me ??
These god damn transitions  too good man
Mateeee matee your visual effects are in fire🔥🔥🔥
You are a damn genius.
If you want to get some serious gains i would look into top end kits for your 4.6 ive heard you can double your horse power but they are expensive and are a little bit of work
Make a turbo super charger difference vid and make more car better vids
Nakazoto will need to see this video.
Your video quality is improving. I love the transitions you made
Wat socket is that u use to take off your wheel
Cannot wait for the spacer video... currently running 25mm on the 32 Skyline and wanting to go way bigger but not sure if safe or not
My tires on my truck currently  rubbing on my truck. So this video  will help. Thanks man
hey chris, how do you know so much about cars?
Awesome video and great explanations in detail and making sense and also the camera work above was great with the turning angle comparison.. awesome work
👍. Would this work for a front wheel drive car like a Ford Focus MK2?
I can see where this would be useful for a daily driver. Especially now that the city has a fetish for putting medians everywhere, and a large pickup isn't easy.
Can I do this too my rear wheels
So does the top tip at the end pertain to people who have a steering rack limiter or the ones that don't or the ones like you that removed them so now the pump makes noise, I ask for my 2016 dart that is my first new car that I'm trying to take care of, I do understand error on the side of caution however
You should get some new wheels It would look so much better
But chris now your front wheels are wider then your back wheels isn’t that a problem you maybe want to trow some spacers on the back to
why don't you repent your tyres black \n and add a carbon fibre bonnet
hey chrisfix can you do a vidio on a drift plz
The back wheels are gonna look ugly it looks fwd
What an awesome video you did it bro! Thanks 4 sharing ur knowledge, greetings from México !
Awesome vids don't let the haters get too you
When ChrisFix uploads a video I am as happy as I am on Christmas
I like Ford's my dad owns  a mk4 fiesta
I noticed Nexen N’fera tires. I was thinking about getting a set of them. What are they like in your opinion?
where is interior cleaning? love yours videos
I swear your videos are so detailed and high quality it's ridiculous. You need an award for all the work and help you have done.
You can reuse those clips, although it doesn't look tight enough
A simple yet highly effective modification and great how-to video.  I have a 95 Mustang GT that I will be making into a road course car and will be adding this modification to the list!
I just give her all the gas and drop the clutch and drop the clutch and boom sharp u turn made
When are you uploading the video on wheel spacers/adapters? @chrisfix
Would this be bad to do this on an ifs 4x4 4Runner?
Speaking of steering rack replacements (4:55), any chance you'll be doing a rack replacement video?
ChrisFix,Good to see you again,but i'm afraid that these spacers could be the reason of  Alignment issues because the rear wheels are on stock measurements at the same time front wheels are some degree out?
K-turn?  Never heard that term...I know 3-point turn.
CHRIS I DO HAVE AN IDEA FOR A VIDEO, it is about stetic upgrade. Do you know anything about the hydrographic dip?
I absolutely love your videos ! I like your prefesional work, and how cool you are telling what to do from begining to the end ! I'am polish and i understand everything clearly :D Love it ! Thumb up ! Can't wait for next video !
Hey Chris I am a big fan and I have a question. I own a 2000 Ford Explorer SOHC engine and when I first start up it makes a grinding noise but it's ONLY when I start up and then right after it goes back to normal also occasionally when I hit 2500 rpm I hear a weird grinding noise but sometimes it'll go away what would be your opinion on both of these issues ?? Thanks
how much ugly your mustang can get ?
serious shopping kart angle ..🤔 it reminds me of tokyo drift when i was shopping with my mom
Your car sound like 2015 mustang or camero now
Hello Chris ,how r u ? ,I'm Yahia.I live in Ohio-Clevland . I love ur chanel,and I learnd a lot from you how to fix my car . I have a problem ,that my battery and the hand brake lights  are on after the engine starts, even I replaced the altenator + battery.Can u help me with that? I have Suzuki Forenza 2008 . Thank you
Some cars already have a excellent turning radius like my Honda Civic.  It turns in a tight spot.   I remember the 80s Toyota van could turn around in a tight radius.   Nice simple modifications.
Chris where do you live
I don't know what is about you Chris but I've watched this video twice already I absolutely love your videos
great video. I think it would be important to mention that the hubs on the wheels should be clean and free of corrosion so they fit flush and smooth against the rotor/wheel hub. I noticed your wheels had some corrosion on them. ive been a subscriber for a long time and I really enjoy your videos. keep it up I look forward to the next video :)
That cardboard angle finder is genius.  Simple yet functional.
change your name to ChrisMods
And it's bone stock :P
I thought you were going to explain the angle of the dangle! LOL
hid upgrade
Please post more vids
I like how easy it is for you to access your steering rack... so much room down there.... wish I had that kind of clearance.
Grrrrrr! What better place to vent than under a car vid? Took my truck in to get my belts tightened and when they were bringing my truck back out to me the brake line went. So a 70 dollar trip turned into a 400 dollar trip. Oddly I originally had an appt for the belts for Tuesday but last week I had the urge to get in sooner, so they got me in today. I always get feelings like that. I am known for them.  So this would have likely happened while I was driving over the weekend. \n\n On the plus side they gave me a 2018 Chevy Equinox as a loaner until next week. Plenty of rust under my truck also. I really wish the previous owners(My dad and his wife) were more proactive and had it undercoated. I live in the rust belt of Canada, probably the world. Snow, ice, salt, etc. The truck is 13 years old. Time to start saving I guess for a new vehicle. Sorry about the rant but I know your viewers could relate and I enjoy typing. Heh.  Also, maybe they were trying to kill me? o.O
Hey Chrisfix do you think you can make a video on fixing a trucks frame because it is bent? My trucks frame is bent and I don't know how to fix it.
Can make video on how to install a electronic exhaust valve can be bought from ebay
Hey Everyone\n\nI found my dream car for very good money the problem is its been sitting for 16 years is it worth buying? Btw its an Audi Urquattro. Thanks
Now the back need spacers to fill that gap. Lol
I'm about to do this right now to my sn95 lol
Hey Chris great videos bro hope you can visit us here in Florida to drift with us we have a really nice area to drift good luck and keep it up thumbs up for you bro
Cold air intake video ! Please !
Hey Chris! U r the best. I like u. Thanks for video.
Oprah is so out of touch. Its a product of circumstance I suppose - she used to be so relatable .
Ellen is so crazy😭 no doubt.
I love Ellen and Oprah.
Only Ellen can make Oprah do that. Lolz
I couldn't stop laughing Ellen is hilarious & that lady & her daughter are so lucky to have gone home with Ellen & Oprah
Got an add with Ellen in it.
This was too funny!!
i dont think i could handle so much fail in one store
Did they not know tiffany?
I love Oprah but she is trying too hard to beat Mitchell Obama hang out with Ellen coz that was absolutely amazing
*Brings a big bag*\n\n*gets food*\n\n*puts the groceries in the bag without paying the money*\n\n😂👌🏼
Oprah hair is so pretty!!  I mean gorgeous Even!!

That looked like a lot of fun shopping with you two. thanks for sharing.
Ellen is so childish and I love that 😂😂😂
I wonder if the Ellen show could help me find my biological family I was adopted at birth and I always wanted to meet my real mother
That guy gave the whisky to his kid XD
the guy tried to give his son the vodka lol
Look at us we are so rich from interviewing trailer trash that we make fun of people who have to actually shop heee haaa heee haaa
I just love this kind of laughter and friendship if the world functioned at this level on a regular basis this would be a better world. Keep laughing Oprah and Ellen two great women I love u and I'm praying for u too God bless  D. Pitts
*Ellen and Oprah get into a random person's car to go to their house* \n\n\n\n\ncasual
Commercial excuse matter recover those fitness article together initially numerous.
What a nuisance x2. Would leave the store right away if these two walked in.
Ellen is so funny 🤣👌🏿👌🏿 Just love them both🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿👑👑👑💰💰💰
Are people really that privileged that they don't even go to grocery stores?!?!
Oprah has her own food? well I know what my next diet will include.... love these ladies
How come the screen is black for me?
“You have 2 kids you might need that.” *passes the bottle of liquor* 😂😂😂
Stephanie is the luckiest person at any grocery store ever
Do you know how much money is in that store right now,
“Ellen bring my money back” lol I wanna be that calm about someone else having my cash bruh
Why do they go into these upscale grocery stores? Why not go into a grocery store in the hood?
Shocking. Thought Oprah would have more than 40 dollars .
I love how Oprah just goes with it and has a laugh 😂
maaan i just wish i meet Oprah and Ellen before i die
Ellen copied jake paul 's idea of talking on the mall's phone
No wonder why they haven't been to a grocery store in years. Christ!
Hmm Ellen isn't funny in this clip, she's just annoying.
Could u imagine running into Ellen @ a Grocery Store??? Wowsies!!! Mind. Blown.
oh good lord, that Tugboat magazine cover was so frickin funny. Ellen just doesn't get embarrassed.
Ellen your amazing, like your such a great person, and your amazing at what you do. Love you so much!
who are these people?  youtube u r drunk (again)
Oh sure, when Ellen and Oprah take over a store, they don't get kicked out, but when Logan Paul does it.... lol
WHO'S HERE AFTER 1M VIEWS?
who's here to taste the melons? ????
Ellen you're so AWESOME and inspiring!😀 You love music and so do I. I'm a singer 🎤 and would love to showcase my talent for you someday!! 🎶
Economic taxpayer second body extremely kiss sport Asian hot in.
Is it weird that i ship them
I love both but for some reason, I found them a bit obnoxious in this video...
Ok, so a bull and a dyke walk into a china shop...
Are they both drunk? 😂😂😂 it looks so fun!!!
WTF! How old are these people? This would be something we did in HIGH SCHOOL! Time to grow up people. These two should be laughing and carrying on with their GRAND CHILDREN for Christ's sake. Dispicable 🖕
Ellen seems so fun to hang out with!
Oprah' s product placement ruined this a little for me. 😕😒
It’s never too big.
wow oprah. if a man held up 2 melons like that hed be run out of town. not funny.
They seem to be in love. . .
The girl from the groceries was so dry..... i would dieeeee if i saw Oprah
Oprah and ellen shopping for groceries?? way to go!
When they were holding up the magazine of Ellen the mom in background was covering her daughters eyes
0:50 is me shopping with my nan 😂
I almost died of laughs!!! Awesome clip.
way faint economist laser stop other thought whatever lack space bend.
Even the store workers are filming. hahaha
Oprah and Ellen should make a tv show together
Peaches everyone. Oprah's touched the them! So true Ellen
Notice Andy in the background at 03:15 when Ellen scares Oprah and he is like scared FOR Oprah HAHAHAHA
They are so funny together
Ellen and Jake Paul are are honestly the craziest people when it comes to Stores and shoppin😂😂
Was Ellen named Ellen? Or, was she named Hellen and decided to drop the r?
When that kid just stared at Oprah when Oprah said just drink it
Lol, 3:55, the lady covered her daughter's eyes 😂😂
This guy is rich
This is going to be the inspiration for my next video. Crazy
I feel like these grocery store videos are just Ellen and her friends showing off how rich and entitled they are.
d most powerful people in d world oh God
someone has to compile all of Oprah's scream in this episode
The dilemma of finding the right sized cucumber.... 😏😏😏🤣🤣🤣

This song should have been released during the summer tho

In Ty we trust
The way that beat dropped—wasn't expecting that. The Only You sample is vicious. Ty Dolla $ign + production consisting of a sample from a '90s song = deadly. An instant smash hit.
and listening to this track we can understand how good of a producer dolla sign really is....😊👹👹👹
I'm On Jet Skis With Naked Bitches 🌊
Shame that the song lasts so little time bcause i can hear that beat all fuckn day, amazing

So simple but so effective. I cried a little just thinking about who I used to be and how far I came.
Loved this!! Annnnd Colette's pants are super cute :) \n\nXOXOXO
That made me cry 😢
Are you guys going to volg again
Carlie, this was such a lovely exercise; I thought maybe I'd feel too weird doing it but I decided to follow along and actually found it helpful. Love where the momsview is going! I'm going to keep this exercise in mind
Wow... I needed that! <3
This video was really good. I enjoyed the exercise very much.
Ahh I love this very helpful. It was super weird to think about those 2 people because those are very different for me at least. Love this and love you lovely ladies ❤️
I need so help my husband decided to walk away after 21 yrs of marriage  I feel lost
I really want to see all the kids and see how much they have grown
Love you guys!\nNot a huge fan of the extra camera angles... but love ya anyway!!
I would really like to see a video about infertility and its struggles from you guys and maybe an expert and someone who has struggled or is struggling with that. I think it’s a subject that’s not talked about frequently and something that affects a lot of women and couples. Love you girls!
I really enjoyed doing this :) felt a bit silly but think it worked to remind me of how far I’ve come in my life
I couldn't do it. yet. But I feel like my friends would love this, sounds so amazing
I love this
Haha I love the nose prints on Carlie's windows. Can totally relate to that! 🐶🐶
How great. I love that. Thanks so much for sharing. \nSince I don't have any kids of my own yet, I wanted to know if any of you guys had fertility issues leading up to any of your pregnancies or even if you know people who have or do.\nI have been struggling with infertility for the last 3 years and I'm trying to trust in God. I'm having a really hard time knowing what my next step should be and if having kids is really what God wants for me. I am LDS and there is definitely some expectations I know that there is only so much I can control but this is something that is really really difficult for me to not feel shame and guilt about. I'm 29 and been married for 9 years for the first 6 years of my marriage we used contraceptive. I think, Did I screw this up? Is it my fault my body isn't working? Did I miss my window for having children? and all the time everyone is asking me when I'm going to have a baby. It was easier to tell people that we were waiting than it is now to say we are trying and failing. Any insight or even just words of advice you can give would be much appreciated. Thanks!
I love you guys, I really needed this. thank you.
Dear ladies, still so happy you are back. \nI would be interested for you to talk about cancer and breast cancer. Last year my mom has gone through her second round of breast cancer, the first was 10 years ago. It was a tough time and I learned so much about cancer and about myself. I feel like my mom, though right now she is struggling with depression, is growing stronger and learning so much about herself and her own strength because of the disease. What is hard about it for her right now and for me during the last year is accepting that you sometimes are weak and that you are not always at your best and you are still you and you are still a genuinely perfect person just the way you are. My thoughts, I would love to hear yours. \nBest wishes from Germany! \nOh PS I'll be in Santa Barbara, California and in south Utah the next couple month. If you do any kind of meet up I am dieing to meet you. You gave me so much strength, knowledge and are a big role model for me! Love you
Dark hard times make the amazing times even better :) life is about learning, sometimes we learn things we don’t want to but it’s worth it in the end.
I think a GREAT show idea would be top self help books yall have liked, or a book club type thing.
Real moms have dirty windows. 😉 Good to see it's not just me. 👍🏻
It looks like collete is crying
Totally teared up while doing this. Thank u for reminding us to love ourselves through the good and the bad. Loving this new moms view!!!!
I love how genuine The Mom's View is!
That was beautiful! Thank you!!
dont like carlies self help on her channel either.i am a hippy and fake hippy isnt helpful
That’s bullshit she got cheated and she acting like he didn’t do anything wrong
That made me cry, imagining myself at my weakest and giving that person a hug. Thank you Carlie!
Mommytard is so sad at the end :( stay strong and think about yourself first cause nobody will no matter who you are.
One day I want to be this carefree
I absolutely needed this today because sometimes it's hard to remember that we won't always be at our worst... I love you ladies and thank you for having these chats with us. I feel like you three are the sisters i always longed for. \n\nAlso a Friday show that would be amazing: How to not lose yourself when becoming a parent/wife?
so glad this is back 😭💗
Welp. If Susan watches it then it must go to the trending page!
Cathal love ❤ all girls Cathal like you girl \nI a am little sissy girl mistress
I love Carlie's top where is it from ????
I'd love if there was a self-help video like this every week :)
Carlie! You have no idea what that did for me. Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart .
Should have Shaycarl as a guest. Seeing how he is a selflove specialist. Only give him a twitter account and some lube.
Omg I literally cried I needed that thank u
I really liked the exercise Carly!
Ugh this is why I love you guys. ❤️
As I did the exercise with you girls I was so taken back by how differently I viewed my best self and worst self. How they almost seemed like completely different people. Thank you for this and for helping me reconcile my worst and best self. Self love is something I am working on too!
That was.... unexpectedly emotional! Jeez! From an overweight, suicidal college freshman to a happy wife, mom and fit triathlete. I've come a long way, and sometimes it's hard to recognize that through all the daily details!
I loved this exercise. It made me so incredibly emotional because I know my younger self would be so proud of who I am today. Made me want to go back and hug the little girl that thought things would never get better and just hold her and tell her it's all gonna be okay.
This exercise was interesting.  Because as I am  urrently at my lowest in self esteem right now. It felt good to hug my old fun self and have my fun self hug my new sad self. It's weird to say, but it made me feel like I was being a friend to my new self as well as my new self felt relief for having a friend to hug and admire.
Thank you Carlie! This is a life saver! You're the best!
In love with Carlie's top! 😍
I don't know why but when I closed my eyes, tears just streamed down my face as I remembered my hard times. But it helped as you kept talking. I wish I knew about doing stuff like this when I was in that place of sadness. I love you girls!💕
*when are the shaytards going to post again*
Oh mom's view gals, I needed this more than you know right now.
Wow, it's been a year since I was at my worst. Suicidal, unmotivated, etc. I'm doing so much better now. People keep telling me that I look different, beautiful, and happier without even knowing my situation. Improved mental health shows on the outside too, I guess! What a great exercise!
Carle I did it with you and it was great. Thank you
Does anybody know the name of this exercise or who created it? cheers :)
Thank you this helped a lot! high school is such a struggle for me competition in seat placement in music , being a clumsy/awkward lab partner, mediocre grades, parents saying I'm a failure and other insecurities I have. I feel like if I pay attention to the good times all the bad times will gradually vanish away and I will become the person I see myself as in the future :) at one point last year I was considering suicide because of all the academic and social obstacles I've been going through. I hope I inspired someone today and that the bad times are what make us a better person today :)
Hey an idea for next Friday could be to update us on all of your kids and maybe bring some guest stars (the kids)
I'm not sure this would work for me. I can't imagine meeting myself during the darkest time, because I'm currently in the darkest time right now
Thank you!  This was so great!  I'm leading a bible study for women called Broken, and Im going to share this video as one of the exercises we do during our time together.
Dont mind me being immature but this remind me a TON of Joy & Sadness from Inside Out! 😍😍😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm going to try this. After Vegas incident, I dont feel like a good role model for my kidsk as i come undone. If I can stop and say the chances are small and find the best me that knows through prayer and what I've learned I can pull myself together. I'll try anything. :(
Nice exercise thanks for sharing! Sweet lady's.....💞😊
Carlie I'm obsessed with your shirt!!! Where did you get it?
Can you guys pleaseeeee do a nother challenge
Love this exercise! Thanks for sharing! What an awesome perspective!
This is beautiful!!!! Thank you!!!!!
I loved that exercise!
The BBQ at the back makes so much more sense! Last video it created a weird person shaped shadow :)
I loved this soo much!
It would be fun to have moms on the loose again! Especially for The Friday Show🤗
Really really loved this video
OK. only 5 seconds eyes closed aaaand hello tears! lol thank you Carlie It was an awesome exercice.
Thank you so much for this exercise. I haven't been feeling like my authentic self lately, and this has just made me step back and reminded me I'm a strong individual.
Thank you! Yes, the exercise was  helpful, I got teary eye.
I like moms
That helped a lot thanks guys 😊 I looked at myself two years ago when I was self harming and hateting myself. Then I put the person who I am today with her. Today I am happy loved and pregnant with a baby boy. I had them hug each other and the one who was self harming  was so happy to see the me today and was happy to see me/herself pregnant.  God had a plan for me and today I finally realized what it was supposed to be.  Thanks again ☺❤
I cried. I seriously cried. I loved this exercise
Love you all ❤️💛💚💙💜
That was wonderful. The exercise; Carlie's explanations and advice were so on point and just so good. I will remember this, use it, and share it. Thank you.
I don't know if I can be my best again, but ill try my best. Thank you ladies
Amazing. Made me cry when I did this. But in a good way. Thank you so much 💕
I think it’s so important for people to realize that you can be at your highest and lowest in different seasons of your life multiple times. Don’t forget and try to bury your lowest self, embrace it. It is what makes the highest times in our lives that much more blessed. It’s what makes the experiences in our lives worthwhile. Especially the hard ones. It shapes us continuously. If you stifle your pain and suffering, you won’t ever truly be able to experience and attain self love.
This looks like an awesome exercise! Happy Friday ladies, hope you have a great weekend!! 😊
Loved this, very good reminder to know that if a person wants something bad enough, they can rise up and get the strength to do it and overcome, but the Big thing you missed mentioning, the major source lacking is how Jesus is the source, the one who actually gives a person the genuine Strength and peace they need to grow, a person can only do so much on their own, without Jesus they'll find themselves unhappy somewhere in their life cuz he's the only one who can heal their soul by becoming their peace. Leaving Jesus out, would be touching base on new age propaganda, gotta be prayerful in all things. I'm not speaking about church or religion I'm talking about the real spiritual battle that takes place daily in the mind and heart, (Satan vs self and Jesus) Jesus Himself was the one holding me up during my worse time, and it's Because of HIS encouragement, strength, and friendship/love, that i was  Strengthened to overcome alcoholism, drugs, severe depression and sucidial thoughts. I could never have done any of that all on my own. Love yas
so love you guys!!
Definitely got teary eyed through that <3 thanks mums!
Selp helf
needed thay Thanks Moms!!!
Love this exercise!!
Kayla, you’re wonderful! 💕
I didn’t even know it until now, but I really really REALLY needed this today! xoxo 😘 ❤️
Thank you. I needed to see this video
That was so nice. I cried to be honest. I've been going through a rough time and this helped. Thank you.
That made me cry when I did it!!  Beautiful exercise and a great reminder!
I love carlie! Love her voice
Carlie I love this I'm crying!!
Thanks for this Carlie, Ive had a hard week and to do this just now has made me happy and I know I can get through it. Great video! :)
Love the exercise. I even shed a tear while doing the exercise.
I would love to see more girly stuff, girl chats, makeovers, makeup, hair, clothes talk and more. You should go on a girls trip and just relax, do some shopping, get massage, manicures etc
Has Carlie had plastic surgery or something because her skin looks so tight!
I thought the middle girl was the mom from shaytards
I'm feeling pretty constipated
I am watching this video as im pooping! XD!
What, who drinks 8 cups of water a day? 4 is fine unless you're working out. Or unless they count the water you take from food, than I would understand. But no needs to drink that much water a day.
Does anyone know what software they use to make the infographics?
Why am İ watching this?
That's definitely not average weight
I honestly don't go in with my phone or newspaper when I go in the bathroom because it doesn't take long to come out. Why do people do this?
Please do  if NASA had a 1 trillion dollar budget 
I’ve always pooped once a day, always in the morning. But I took a biology class at my community college, and was totally shamed by everyone telling me they poop after every meal. (That’s why restaurants are required to have restrooms.)
Are you ALREADY running out of ideas?????
lol i poop a day in a year
The Infographics Show can u make a video of differences in American and European food... i  mean why US food is so trash packed with chemicals and EU food is better ? :)
Now we are asking real questions.
What a crappy video\n\n\n\nNot really only for a joke
Yo do a vid on North Korea vs China
Wow u make great content i really enjoy watching ur vids u earned a subscriber!
I poo about 5-7 times a day as i have ibs and ibd 💩👌
You've clearly​ never met a 100 lb girl who likes Chipotle 💩💣
Why is this in my recomended? And it is in the Entertainment Section ._.
Dahell? poop once a day? im more like once a week.
We had sit down toilets until 2012
💩I just laid down the law.
WTH, The Squat Toilet is Indian and it does have a flushing mechanism.
Think about it. In the future the kids will be even more depressed and stressed because they will have to learn more history. Because things that happen after we go to school....and they will have to study it.
You should do 10 Most Highest Paying Jobs.
Who else is picking up their shit and eating it?
Now that I've been eating healthier I've been pooping 3'xs a day. It's literally impossible to gain weight!
Dogshit turns white when left out in the sun.
We brits dont call that a toilet roll.\nToilet roll and toilet paper are synonymous.
I disliked because this is  a \n\n\n\n\nCRAPPY VIDEO!! Jahah
I'm pooping while watching this...
42 minutes a week HA that's funny
As I'm l  the toilet dam I've been exposdd

Crap is a swear word in every English speaking country except America. Also, I don't where on earth you got your research from but we (The British) do not call that water gun thing toilet roll. We call toilet paper toilet roll, you literally had them in the same frame, they are the same thing.
How much do you maststbate in a lifetime
We don’t call it a bidet toilet roll, toilet roll is toilet paper you down. Fact check your script before you post your videos.

A toilet roll is another term for toilet paper, not a mini hose. The number of times these videos get basics wrong. Research people!
I'd love spraying water on my ass. Imagine how clean you'd feel after. I hope the US adopts this...

I've been waiting AGES for another zoe and louise collab!!!!! you should do a car karaoke pt. 2 video :))
It's so weird when Zoe said do you smell pickled onions or like vinegar I was eating salt and vinegar chips
Omg I just watch an old video and wondered when Lou has her baby can Zoe tell us again ❤️❤️❤️
I loved this video! I love when you make these types of videos with Zoe! You two are always hilarious together!
I love when y’all do videos like these!
I love how they are whispering but also filming this and putting this out into the world lol
Brilliant! And your hair looks lovely
Love it when Jim popped up😂
Thats the best video 😭❤️
This is literally one of my fav videos of yours and Zoe’s, so raw and truthful man😂😂🙏🏽
Jim in the boot hahahahahah
I actually want some more of these
This is amazing!!!! I'm cry laughing !!!
I laughed so hard watching this
the not worth watchings are literally my favourite things on the internet. they always put a massive smile on my face. LOVE IT!
i love these videos they are the best i just crylaugh through the hole thing
Re watched the part when Joe scares you over and over again. It's hilarious. 'Ive weed a bit'😂😂
I loved this video so much hahahah
When Zoe started singing the only difference between martyrdom and suicide is press coverage I squeal like the little fan girl I am
If Louis wasn't expecting, I'd think that you were smoking the funny cigarettes 😉
Y'all should go to Disney Paris
You all are too cute as friends!
Omg... the bleach. I almost fell out of my chair. Can’t. Breathe.
I've wee'd a bit 😂😂😂😂
Question: how did you guys meet on 2009 and Louise was 4 months pregnant when darcy is 6
I love these videos, love the spontaneity❤️ ‘DON’T..I’VE WEED A BIT’
I was cry laughing at Louise's reaction to Joe scaring them 😂😂
This is one of the funniest videos in ages..can you do more of them? Love it x

I LOVE the not-worth-watching videos.
Love watching videos of both of you! xx
This is honestly one of my favourite videos 😂
Such great video with lots of Cameos xx
I've missed you both together
I miss these types of videos. Shows you don't always need the fancy cameras, background set, lights and a challenge
MUKBANG (the word Zoe mentioned) is a Korean word meaning 'eating show', where you eat food in front of a camera and talk usually
This video made me so happy😂😂😂😂
pls do a reaction to kpop with zoe
Love this video. Such a cracker and I wished I had a friendship like ye do. 💖💗
Uhm, question... If they first met in 2009 and Louise was pregnant. How come darcy is born in 2011? Did she have a miscarriage I don't know of?

Very funny banter. Comedy gold😂
Baleghd
I love you
I laughed so much :)
Actually loved this😂❤️❤️
Louise is *WRONG* It's cruel to assign a name and gender to an unborn person. Let the unborn person make their own choice.
I love videos about people's BELONGINGS and ROOMS and SPACES. It is the most fascinating thing what everyone has, what connections people have to the things they own and how they arrange them. What crumpled receipts people have in their bags, and their favourite cuddly toys, and the things they keep as mementos. The things they can't throw away and the things that remind them of, say, 2007 specifically. The colours and light flow and the arrangement of furniture in people's rooms. How people organise the same stuff in a thousand different ways. What we consider necessary, or a part of our identity, or a tangible expression of some facet of ourselves. Anyway I want you to know that I own 20 plastic frogs.
I am a camera, I didn’t want to learn this truth
Dan I can watch you do anything and love it, literally when I feel down I binge watch your videos and it immediately makes me feel better because you're so honest in every video, I love it ❤️
YOURS WILL SOON BE NOT AS NICE
I mean you have 4 suits that you have worn so talk about being an adult 🤗
Not to be captain obvious but you take your dry cleaning to the dry cleaners.
Yeh but is it even a Daniel J Layton video without the Harry Potter books in frame???
this is one of my favourite “series” i guess idk i love the two videos you’ve made about this it helps so much.
Dan. I would hands down date you. Like no joke.
HAHAHAH the Janet posters even in ur uni halls.\nYou already knew who you were. I'm proud.
Does anybody really know what dry cleaning is? A good place to go for dry cleaning is Timpsons, and they might be able to fix boots as well. Kill two birds with one stone. Potentially three birds with one stone, because there are Timpson branches at some supermarkets like Sainsbury's and Morrisons, so you can do food shopping as well.
Not knowing what dry cleaning is--too real.
Dry cleaning is a process of soaking in a chemical solvent rather than water. It's for fabrics that would degrade in water, or for pieces that are too delicate for a washing machine.
I have just cleaned the three mugs from my room. And I now have a clothes bench at the end of my bed. I will never really be an adult.
Well done for getting this far in it! (This is genuine and not sarcastic btw)
My Mum asked me to take a dress to the dry cleaner once and was perplexed about why I seemed so stressed out by what seemed to her, a simple task. I had to go to the city, talk to the lady I mean... what do I ask for? Can I just be like, here's a dress do your thing? How much does it cost? Can I pick it up that day? That week? Whats the deal?\n\nIt's funny because I only did it that once and it was so stressful it was all kind of a blur so if I ever needs to do that again I'm back to square one I've got no idea.
where is your closet from? it is exacly what i've been looking for
But you forgot about room tour!!!
You should do some film recommendations 😻
Ask google to find you a decent dry cleaners. You haul your stuff to them they work their magic and then you get it back clean pressed and on hangers. If you want your stuff starched make sure to ask. I liked a really stiff chefs coat back in the day. Like turn it sideways and it doesn't budge. I'd ask for hot press and triple starch. Then I wouldn't have to iron it as hard to keep that nice line. It shouldn't be too expensive either. I mean less than $20ish per suit. Usually they can do it super fast too.
M8 where are your fairy lights from? 😂. The really important question
Hm... with all of the stuff you still have, I'm not sure I'm convinced that you ever actually got rid of anything. Lol. Dan, at this rate you are going to end up on that show hoarders!
Did... did Dan go to Canada recently? He really didn't mention it much if he did ;)
Stoff
You're so right about spending all your money moving that you have none to actually decorate. I found this out when I moved to edinburgh and ended up buying two leather recliner sofas for £50 in total. They look like shit, but are comfy as hell. I also bought a wardrobe and chest of drawers for £40 in total as they were ex display. It is these kind of moments when I realise that I am truly an adult.
I moved in august, the bedroom is a disaster (the rest isn't much better but that isn't my point). Soon very soon there will be bought another closet for the bedroom, so at least 40 % of the floor will reappear from under bags of towels, table cloths and bedding stuff - I hope.\nVedo is nice, I have missed these short interactions, like back in the old days where you challenges yourself to do a video every week :)
3:29 babe you could never turn me off.\n\n\nhahaha.\n\n\n\nlol.
Wow, I'm fairly confident that me and Dan shared the same student halls... and I can confirm they really are great!
OMG Tell me if you have figgured out the Dry Cleaning! I have a dedicated place in my bathroom where I hang my dresses for weddings... and they stay there, I buy new ones. I love the old ones... they need dry cleaning.... I don't even??? I am good at grown-up stuff (thats half a brag right there!) but Dry Cleaning is an actual mystery...
Wall of memes i love it
Dry cleaning is cleaning using regulated and toxic chemicals instead of water and its so expensive its not economical for anyone to have a private dry cleaning setup which is why you need to go to a storefront for it. Also water will shrink suit fabric which is why you need to do that.\n\nJust google dry cleaner near me, bring your suits, and maybe ask how much its gonna be and how long its gonna take.
I am moving house at the the moment, so I can feel this video really well.
Please make more of these. Mainly because I love the way you pronounce stuff.
I relate to this so much. I started uni 2 months ago and I'm still decorating my room!
Were you in Lincoln courts because that's where I am right now.
LEGIT HAVING THE EXACT SAME ADULT PROBLEMS. I have a coat and a dress that need to be drycleaned, plus a pair of boots that desperately need a fix. So please update us on when and how you solve these issues.
Your VEDO is my favorite VEDO, I could honestly listen to you talk about anything.
Been in my place for 11 years now.   Still not done.
This video was the perfect length for me to watch while I took off my make up. So THANKS DAN!
So excited for your vid on my birthday (25th october, pls give me a shoutout am too excited <3 )
I moved to uni a few weeks ago, and it took me about 3 days to put my polaroids up in my room. And oh mY GoD did it make a difference. Literally 15 tiny little photos from holidays, SitC, parties etc made my room instantly feel more like home. Today we printed a load of flat photos and hung them in our kitchen/dining area. It's crazy how much difference a few photos and fairy lights make
In the time between when I was 11 to 18 I moved house 9 times. The thing that mad my room my room was all my posters and drawings. Every house they moved with me and made it the new place a home.
As a kid I used to love going to the dry cleaners with my mum/dad. The front desk was at a level above my head but it had a sort of ledge on it that was child level. I thought they were the best place caus they remembered that little kids like to see the top of a front desks too. I was a very easy child to please 😁
Okay a little tip for the drycleaning suits. IT'S expensive. This is something a lot of professional instrumentalists do. They wait until it's really cold out, like freezing overnight and they just put their suits outside to get the smell of sweat out of their suits. Apparently this is supposed to work, don't ask me how, I'm a girl, but I've heard this so many times by different people. It's worth a try.
Talking about things being familiar and comforting, sitting in a new uni flat and just hearing your outtro makes me feel so much more comfortable in my own skin. Thanks for the video today Dan :)
Lucky, my uni doesn't allow me to hang pictures or posters on the wall, not even with Blu Tack. However, there's a huge corkboard along the wall, so my grandad undid a couple of the screws and that's where my pictures hang instead.
I started uni about a week ago and this helped me a lot :) thanks Dan
I legit want to do a big tidy now... I suppose that is procrastinating as I have SO many essays due in
This spoke to me. I feel like I am in exactly the same place as you. I love the chill clean up time!
Go to the dry cleaners for your suits And the cobbler for your boot.
‘How do you amass glasses in such a fashion’ *stares disappointedly at the piles of glasses and clothes scattered all over my war zone of a room*
I have your videos to keep me company while I'm doing my evening routine. :-)
clothes on clothes on clothes on clothes...... on a *chair* \n\nnever thought I'd relate so much <3
Lovely vid Dan, hope you're settling in well! I really enjoy your I'm just a normal person doing normal things with a sarcastic yet hopeful British attitude brand. It makes me feel like I'm not the only one, you know?
I love you Daniel J. Layton!! Xxx
I love that you guys live so close it really is like you're living in the Friends building because you have your friends close 😊
YOU'RE HAVING DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR
I love when YouTubers make videos of them just talking about life and doing everyday tasks like in Dodie's vid where she makes pasta and talks about her love life or now when Dan is just cleaning his room. It feels so personal and I feel at ease and so comfortable in this one sided conversation.
1:05 i now have defying gravity stuck in my head cheers daniel j
i cleared so much shit out of my childhood bedroom a couple of months ago and dear god CATHARSIS
Literally just stopped everything I was doing to watch this video I love all your videos Dan but these are my favourite just listening to you rambling is in a way comforting just feels like we are two friends hanging out and just talking xx
The not feeling settled and 'at home' until you've decorated it to make it your own personal safe space is SO TRUE. You discussed it in your August PMS too and all of the chaos of my mental state suddenly made sense: I recently moved to a new city for a year long work placement.. I'm living with people I barely know who know each other better, I'm away from friends who in the past two years of uni have become like family, and as a result am missing my beloved family more so than previous years away from home. We can't decorate our rooms, so I have large expanses of white walls surrounding me and whenever I'm in my room I never felt quite fully relaxed.. It's not MY space, it's no ones space and as such it feels like I've in turn rented my brain out to so many feelings that I can't nail down and think through freely. Thank you Dan for helping that fall into place, your videos are one thing that does feel homely (if that can be not a weird choice of word) and calm my racing brain xx
I have exactly zero suits, and I also do not know what dry cleaning is ;) sorcery!
I do the same but instead of tidy because effort, I alphabetise my dvd collection and when I say collection I mean I could single handily re open blockbusters
I'm just moved and THANK YOU. My house is like almost there now at about 2 months after the move in date.
@daniel J. Layton Can we start a patrion to get you money to buy a bookshelf because the books just sitting in the corners are killing me.
That was my room then I moved out from my parents and left it all because it didn't fit in my suitcase
I love your videos you are an inspiration <3
i love videos like this :))
free shirt when you're buying a suit
Your hope framing and focusing makes me feel relaxed
9:25 min How Do Dry Cleaners Clean Clothing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhlVfHMidZU :)
Omg I love your Harry Potter poster 💛
Lol dan is adorable
I'm enjoying you VEDO immensely! ^_^
Stoff stoff stoff stoff stoff
YES DAN
STOFF
oh ma goodness
Relatable
bit echo-y innit. still great tho. still great.
That Janet Jackson poster though
SPOTLESS
It takes a talent to entertain people with the bare minimum. I mean, i've just watched 4 miutes of you folding clothes and it ended too soon. Looking forward to tomorrow's vid :)
Yay, i got the first like.i love you're videos thank you for them i was just in a really bad place, exxellent timing\nDry cleaning is getting a person at a laundromat to do it
Wow I actually want to tidy now, thank you Dan I am going to tidy now
Even though I'm literally a teenager right now, I'm already pretty house-proud and 'Monica'. I have two things on my desk right now - both anthologies for uni - and then there is nothing else messy in my room.
Your gonna laugh but British Heart Foundation is great to cheap furniture.
Really not a fan of wire hangers. Hate to break it to you.
I am sitting in my uni room as a first year with the exact same Friends poster on my wall. Love that
Cleaning has become my relaxing thing as well, whenever my mental health gets a bit shaky and I feel like I can't achieve anything, I just do a bit of cleaning so I know I've got something done, it's lovely!
Cleaning is  so calming sometimes and I agree, cleaning with something like a movie playing in the background is so cathartic
I clean my room to procrastinate then procrastinate cleaning my room :/
I'm a hoarder too, I keep leaves and rocks and things, mostly paper from school... it's clogging up my room. there is stuff everywhere in my room... I am probably, sadly the 'typical teenager' who just hoards plastic bottles. plus I love your poster... 😁
im gonna be dragged to pieces for suggesting this, but i think you have to start buying ebooks instead of physical copys of books until you have more space
hi
Whatever, I'll pick Rick Flair \n\n*Woo!*
재밌다!(It's fun!!!!!)
Lmao!!! This dude's wearing a tupe??? Lmao!!!
He should totally play Polybius next.
AVGN do the game Carfight
2 nerd episodes in 2 weeks nice
Needs more Superman - Goldfinger
yeees. your videos sustain me
661 viewers must be ljn employees
fuck the person
He skipped WCW on NES
Where is ep 148
Sun burnt grandpa?\n\nAngry Grandpa?
where WCW nitro for PC?
Avgn should review cuphead
Lmao!!!!!! Yaaaaasssss!!!!!!!!!
I love u nerd
Chairshot FTW!
300 lbs of man ass......uh anyone remember Yokozuna?
Gary Swann brought me here! 🙊
Who is the guy behind the couch.
That classic nerd vibe is strong here, I love it! Your content is always much appreciated and the practical skits are always fun. <3
WCW/nWo revenge for N64 was good
Holy ball blasting shit Nerd, careful with that fuckin LJN logo, I'm trying to eat!
Great episode, made me laugh real hard a few times. Funniest part is the reaction to the naked man.
Strong Bad Ey? I haven't heard that name in years...
Strong Bad would later split up with their leading member moving to homestarrunner.
When he said  I wonder who published them at that point I knew who he was going to say it was lol
thumbs up if u wana see da nerd's bobs n vagene
He should do an LJN marathon. Like he did with Spielberg Games.
One of the best intros iv ever seen u do. And I stopped watching wrestling years ago
You should make a part 2 to this video. There are so many wrestling games out there. You are hilarious.
I remember there was some wrestling game on NES I loved. I can't remember the name of it but it was damn good for an NES fighting game.
Good effort to bring back angry AVGN.  \n\nI don't think anything can top the Batman episode though.
Have you ever tried reviewing modern wwe games?
James, I'm wondering if you've considered doing Triggerman for PS2? Long considered one of the worst games on PS2. It does function, but it is pretty damn bad in my own experience. Might be a great candidate.
I have no frame of reference for Wrestling games. I played one WWE N64 game at a friend's house and I just kept throwing chairs and a TV at my friend. I think I was Stone Cold. But eh it was okay. I preferred just watching regular WWE. Most sports shows don't really work as games.
hey what about ps1 and n64 sucky games
The Midway Wrestle Mania was the only one that I remember actually thinking was decent, but it was competing with MK and Street Fighter, which were *FAR* superior.
The Nerd makes life so much better. God bless you man
OMG, the Nerd actually said that the controls were fluid instead of fluent. Only took him a decade to get it right...
SlamMasters weekend afternoons in my friends house. I miss those days.
WWF Arcade game is best on the Saturn
SNES Royal Rumble was my childhood, it was awsome lol
YEAH YO! AVGN BRINGING IT BACK!\n\nI feel like you may want to spend a little more time talking about how trash some of the games are. I remember the Sports Games video, you spent decent time on all the bad games. Here, you didn't spend as much time on WCW Super Brawl compared to the other games.\nOverall however, I enjoyed it yo! KEEP GOING!\n\n\n\n\nLJN also made a game called SPirt of Speed....
You should just make a video about all the LJN games you've have yet to play on the show
Man I wish you'd do the N64 wrestling games. They're fucking awesome.
I knew LJN would be back for Revenge
it's not everyday that you'd get to see someone fight an snes cartridge.
You missed the WCW game for the NES. Super Star Pro Wrestling sole good quality is that the Road Warriors are the cover and box art. Also a not an LJN game but still not great.
i lost my shit when you fight againts the WCW catridge
WWF the Arcade on PC is the superior version.
I think AVGN should write more song with Kyle for AVGN like they used to
tell me this.... HE SHOULD REVIEW THE PUNISHER
The Midway games were best on PC. And Wrestlemania wasn't the only one - there was also WWF: In Your House. Great games. They did feel like Mortal Kombat and had fun gameplay. The best thing was that they had local co-op so you could step into the ring with a friend and go crazy. I can't believe James didn't mention that they also feature the infamous MK uppercut.
I know it would never happen but I would pay good money to watch a wrestling match with you vs the CEO of LJN. Watching you layeth the smacketh down on that SOB would be the most cathartic thing that EVER happened LOL.
AVGN vs WCW game at Wrestlemania 34! BOOK IT VINCE!!!
All wrestling games suck except Rumble Roses for PS2, that is the only good one.
Hey AVGN, you should do an episode with Rise of the Robots for 3DO! The game is shitty as fuck, I promise!
Intro was so fucking funny with the beers and shit
I gotta say, this one was much better than Treasure master
Thanks for leaving Pro Wrestling out of it!
was waiting for this episode :D <3
When you said  super brawl, I heard  super bra.
This is one of the greatest Nerd videos yet. Fuckin' hilarious from start to finish.
What happened to the Nintoaster?
This one wasn't quite as funny as the other videos. It's like something is missing.
Sonic 1 was hacked and placed on your shelf.
Awesome episode you hit the right tone again :-)
The best part was that I was in D.C when he posted this
Can you do a Turok review?
Holy shit, this is where Strong Bad is from
Hope you have something big planned for 150!
If there's going to be a sequel to this, the Gameboy (Color) games are absolutely appalling.
In that day 04.10 it is my birthday
The N64 wrestling games were actually pretty fun to play
I still play WWF RAW on my Raspberry pi and its awesome!!!
do a avgn on the Chinese famicom bootleg games
That cartridge guy is so funny and cute lol\nIm happy to see that you still release good content to this day man, congratulations! :D
Sooooooooooooo much better than the previous episode. Also, this was a rather good episode by itself, too. Some really great moments, very few not really great ones... Overall good.
d ocall of duty ghost wost games ever made for pc ps3 and xbox one and xbox 360
Well...After looking at it 3 oder 4 times...is it just me, or is the background (Couch etc.) pasted in with a greenscreen?
Hahahaha Doink in the sewerr
Well atleast now there's W2K (WWE2K)
_Winner is Strong bads_\n\nI'm supremely disappointed by how few homestarrunner comments are here in response to this.
for the 150 special (if your doing any) could you do knuckles chaotixs
WTF happened to your hair or are you just getting old
Royal Rumble wasn't bad at all. Multiplayer with it is an awesome time.
James needs to stop being a jabroni
I find it sad he didn't mention in one of those 16 bit wrestlemania games you could knock out the ref.  One of the best things you could ever do in a game like that.  I used to play the game and record it on VHS and play it back.  It was hilarious to punch the ref in the face and he grabs his head and holds it in pain and then if you hit him again you knock him out and he is laying down and out cold.  How could James miss that?  One of the best things ever in a game to do.
wait a minute... team Strong Bads... is it me, or does that sound like one of the inspirations for Strong Bad off of Homestarrunner?
Tell me where the fucking nintoaster is
Come on WWF Royal Rumble for Sega Gens was not that bad!
Wow, I thought Royal Rumble and Raw were awesome. So fuck me. And the rosters were great.

He's going to take you back to the past to play the shity games that suck ass he rather have a buffalo take a diarrhea dump in his ear he'll rather eat the rotten asshole of roadkill skunk then down it with beer he's the angriest gamer you ever heard he's the angry Nintendo nerd easy angry Atari Sega nerd he's the Angry Video Game Nerd
I hate wrestling so much that I couldn't even watch this.
like the new intro 😉🙂🙃
The most amount of LJN Games in a single episode.  AVGN is BADASS!!!
Come onnnn  bro...I've played those LJN games on the snes and megadrive...they were not that bad back in the days...actually I taught they were great
Sid coming at the end hahahahaha
Aa fuck that Dina, fashion week is so boring anyways
Do not feel bad! Mom guilt is normal, but never feel bad about wanting to be with your baby. Enjoy it when you can and when your not enjoy your you time. Knowing your limit and keeping balance is life... were all trying to keep it in check. Your a good mom & blogger!! You got best of both worlds. 😍
Love that you and Sid has black hoodies on. In time for the All black game. :)
Dina I never knew you had anxiety... Thank you for being so open ... I def get the mummy guilt I am the same with events especially with several in a week. Hey you can always go with me.... Just saying 💛
I know exactly how you feel. Anxiety can be a bitch but who doesn't love being comfortable
i like ur language dina
not to take away from the message of the video, but I love your brows dark!
Thank you for this video. It just shows how real you are, how everyone is fighting their own battles and that no one has it easy. I hope you achieve even greater success in life inshaAllah. Hopefully things will get easier once Hanna grows older. And who knows, she can be your ultimate company to these events :)
Is your eyelashes natural ?
What mascara do you use your eyelashes look bomb girl 😍
feel like there is sth different in ur face. maybe the teeth 😒
Kids grow up so quick, so being with them while they are still little and still think you are the best person in world is more important, then suddenly before you blink, they are know it everything teenagers with stacks of attitude.\nAlthough mom guilt is normal, don't feel ever feel bad about putting your family first. :)
Thanks for being so genuine about your life to us your happiness matters the most
I understand. I struggle with high anxiety as well as depression, including some panic attacks
Respect for Dina! Putting family first! Trust me best thing to do once everything goes you'll always have ur family to rely on nd they will support you
This time with your girl will go make the most of it
You do you and do what makes you happy. You don’t have to follow the crowd and your content is good enough as it is. I love you vlogs that involves your family rather than events and stuff.
Sid is so funny especially when he pops in at the end of your videos also great video thanks for sharing peace
You made some great decisions. You do you boo!
Your teeth does age u a bit but still beautiful
Do what you want, simple :)
Good Dina, always put your family first, you won't get that time again with your daughter when she's already a grown up. Btw love the lashes, what mascara dear, looks good like wearing the one with fake lashes. OMG... That what every girl wishes for a good mascara !!!
Dina your lashes look bomb💣 what did you do to them and what mascara did you use????????? x
Dina whats lipstick you use? i like it
Can you pleaase give a house tour to see details and  interior etc. Beee so much inspooz❤️
What foundation are you wearing dina👌🏽😍
I totally understand & relate to this so much Dina! thanks for sharing <3
We love you Dina! Totally understandable having anxiety.. same here as a musician. Xx
It's ok to reprioritize!  It's great that you can honor family time and when you are tired and over extended.  No apologies or excuses needed!
Good for you gal!! Do you!! If I could stay at home and spend more time with my little one, I sooo would. Maybe one day Insha'Allah...anyway stay happy and sane! 😊
Hi Dina it's very understandable. The opportunities are good but just do you. Hannah will grow up and you won't get the time back so it is ok for you to find a balance that works for you. Please do what you feel good doing and don't stress too much. Also so happy that you will be doing stuff with your sister so you won't be too lonely. ☺️
properly because this is not the right way maybe you don't know so I am just saying and any non muslims who don't know anything about Muslim I don't want any of your reply thanks 🙏🏼
R E A L T A L K ❤️
I think you're just an introvert and get naturally tired after extending yourself too much, there is nothing wrong with that
Absolutely love how brutally honest you are.
Where's the makeup tutorials
The fact that you feel guilty shows how much you care. Hana has such an amazing mother who thrives to make a better change in society. Well done and you deserve a break! We are all human 🌹
You see so many hijabi you tubers begging it to become famous now days so they jump to the opportunity for abit of lime light for this dunya. Dina on the other hand has always remained grounded and raw when it comes to YouTube that’s why no one will ever top her in this game. My fave Muslim YouTuber you are amazing at what you do & a great mom. 💕
Anxiety is a bitch isn’t it. Fair play though if you don’t enjoy them as much for whatever reason. Define your own success you’re doing amazing <3
Your makeup looks awesome, do you mind sharing what you're wearing (specifically foundation and lip stick)? Thanks :)
Your make up is stunning today
Dina your makeup looks flawless! Also, I'm gonna copy that outfit, one day, when i master the art of styling a turban.. one day..
Awe Dina,  I would go places with you if I didn't live all the way across the ocean! I too get mom guilt. We could sit around sulking and feeling guilty together!😁
Youre a good mum and wife, for now put your family first then you do your job, because you have flexible time to aranged, loved to see you doing that 😊😊😊
I know some people might say oh you don’t have to explain yourself, and you don’t, but I love how you keep it real. Even if it’s just these little tidbits of letting us in. You are someone I have looked up to and I also get bad anxiety. So I really appreciate when you put stuff like this out there. Makes me feel less alone, more normal. 💕
Dina!!! you dont have to attend events as a blogger to get attention from us your followers. Honestly you being yourself showing us the real you is the reason you are loved so much do what makes you happy spend time with your family and vlog when you can cos gurllll your vids are absolutely hilarious and tbh im always looking forward to watching your videos and particularly the ones you film while your at home it makes it seem like your one of us. You are amazing at what you do!!!! xx
okay but gurllll what mascara have you got on
Salam go check out my YouTube channel and enter my giveaway!!
I never really comment, but I really felt for you when I watched your video. I've got 4kiddies my eldest is 13 and youngest is 3, and mummguilt is something we all struggle with. At No matter what stage of life we are at. Just wanted to say Your doing an amazing job. Your great at what you do and it's a blessing to have a supportive husband and family around you. Whatever your doing is for your family as well. So take solace in that. Your videos are so genuine, nothing fake about what you do, which is why I love watching your Vlogs. You show the true side to you nothing made up with fairy dust over everything. Where everything is hunky dory in Lala land. Your show the good and bad (nothing too bad) and that's what life is. Do what your happy with. Regardless of what other people are doing. It doesn't matter. Good will come it's self. But it's only worth it as long as your happy xx sending love
I get it. I don't have a child so I don't have the mom guilt but I get the anxiety. It prevents me from doing so many of the things I really want to do. About the mom guilt I think it's really important to remember to sometimes put yourself first. I don't care what people say, you CAN have a career AND a loving family - especially when you have a husband that supports you. So good luck :) and hopefully one day our anxiety wont stop us from doing what we love.
Plz remove ur vineers they dont look good on u, u have good teeth and r pretty the way u r
Can you tell us more about your anxiety & how you cope with it? A lot of Muslim people don’t know how to deal with it. :/
why are you and Sid in back hoodie alot my sweet? new looks?? I love it! ill call it the bank robber look!
Thumbs up to you. Time with your daughter and family is more important than money. You can always make money but can never get time back.
Love the fact that Dina is one of the most normal people ever!!  Love it!!!
Alsalamu Alakuim Allah bless you and protect you.  Love your makeup and turban and black sweater. I want to meet and be your friend so much and love you sister. Your soo cute 💎💎💎💎😘😘😘😘
dina, do you feel part of your anxiety comes from being a Muslim woman? I remember your bafta vlog where you talked about how you had been treated at the afterparty and another event which was supposed to honor ALL women but you and your mother were the only ones having issues getting into the event, tho you had the invite and your ID....I’m sorry if that’s part of the reason and people make you feel that way cause of your religion. I’m not Muslim but I am black, I get the being the only one in the room mentality.
nawww your a great mom tbh, and yes I feel like this when I dont spent time with my siblings/parents forget even the guilt of having a child. Dina your awesome, and hana is super lucky to have such a humble and warm mom like you. Love watching you
Everyday and family-related content is much more interesting than any fashion week :)
I love your videos! Thank you for sharing about mom guilt and anxiety. I feel the same way as a parent. I also felt this way when I was pregnant tge anxiety and more so exhaustion. Keep with awesome work!❤😊
Just follow your intuition and everything will always be ok 💜 I feel like you are more awake than many people. What you feel is real.
I always feel this way when I'm going somewhere new or meeting a huge group. My anxiety plus the guilt of leaving a child at home combine to stop me from going.
You keep it so real! I love that about you :) Don't feel bad for it, I feel you should do what you feel comfortable doing and what makes you happier! ❤️❤️
Why don’t you and sid take turns or with tousey...love u doll
I hate going to academia related conferences where I don't know anyone, my anxiety ramps up to the max, so I totally get it.
Ok firstly.. your makeup and whole look here is beautiful mashallah.. secondly.. you really don't need brands or events to add value to your channels. You have integrity, creativity and control of your content. Quite honestly that is rather refreshing!! \nUltimately though you are a mother and a human being first and foremost. Do what fulfills you and gives your heart joy and contentment sister.  \nLife's short.. live it with no regrets! May Allah bless your home and family always inshallah xx
I get mom guilt all the time. I don't like going to events at all, I avoid them like the plague.
Dina. You are amazing. You need time for yourself and this is your time. You are young too. To be a good mom you need a break. Have fun ❤️❤️
You are a pretty cool human ☺️! Keep your head up 💜.
OMG I'm the same. I don't like to go to events. And I'm a fashion designer and need to. I love to be on the stage, showing off my designs, but being behind the scenes and on red carpet with all these ppl who show off so much, gives me anxiety. And those who go a lot are like highschool cliques.
You don't know me I don't know me. \nI don't live in London I live in spain an most of the time I'm solo, in my case sola. \nI deal with anxiety for everything I do.\nI totally understand you Dina. I hope we could go together to have that cup of tea or to talk about plans and stuff. \nWho knows.\nAll the best.\n\nW salam.
It's like you're speaking my mind. I bet a LOAD of people know exactly where you're coming from x
Omg why couldn’t you and 2c start a podcast together??😍
I prefer someone with me most of the time too if it involves social settings, especially if I don't know anyone! Like what am I supposed to do? Stand around awkward, eat by myself? Like dude, I ain't equipped for dis haha
I miss your old teeth maaan
Dina swore! 😶😂 then later in sha Allah. loooool
Hats off to you Dina... .love you sis !!!
Mom instinct you’re doing amazing sweetie 📷

❤️❤️❤️

love the vlog.
You’re preggers
are you pregnant ?
Dina, Don’t mistake what uv been made to believe is ‘anxiety’ or ‘Mum guilt’ with what is in-fact u fighting against ur natural fitrah as a woman.\n The things u mentioned that u feel are because of the way Allah designed women to be. U will always revert back to ur natural fitrah no matter how much u try to fight it. Society has made a name for  these feelings and called them ‘anxiety’ so that u stop there and don’t look into deeper meanings as to why u feel the way u do. So u don’t look to religion and Allah for guidance. U just say I suffer with anxiety. In fact u don’t. It’s just an internal battle with ur innate feelings as woman to want to be at home with her family where Allah prescribed for is the best place. And to be modest and conservative in every way which is why u find these events so uncomfortable sometimes. \nUr not meant to find it comfortable to be around inappropriately dressed people, alcohol, music. So in fact what ur feeling is complete NORMAL and what isn’t normal is what ur doing and trying to convince urself is a problem with urself called anxiety. Don’t fight ur fitrah. What Allah designed u as. U will never find true happiness that way. Go with what Allah has prescribed for u and only then will u  taste the true sweetness of happiness. \n\nI’m not one to leave comments ever, but I saw this short clip and felt compelled to say something. I get how u feel coz I was in the same position few years ago. Feelings I couldn’t quite explain. An uncomfortable feeling being in certain places. It’s because it’s not what Allah has prescribed for us as women. \nAnd By the Way men face the same battles with ‘anxiety’ as they go against their natural fitrah too. By becoming less protective towards their women. Society has completely changed the roles to make it that men who accept their wives free mixing and dressing inappropriately are viewed as confident in themselves and those who find it uncomfortable for their women to be speaking to non mahrams as insecure men. But no. Men should feel a natural jealousy and protectiveness over their women. Be it their mother wife sister or daughter. When they fight that, they also have these ‘feelings’ that  they can’t explain and name them anxiety. They feel frustrated and can’t explain it. \n\nI hope this didn’t read too bluntly but that’s how text can be sometimes. Compared to actually speaking about stuff. \n\nAnyway I just wanted to help u with the way ur feeling. I know exactly what it feels like and I am now free of that. Alhumdulilah. TabarakAllah. Happiest Iv ever been. \n\nAs Muslims we’ve been given the gift of knowing what’s to come and if we truly claim this to be certainty then how can we justify the actions we knw r wrong to be ok.. what will u say to Allah when ur standing infront of him.. that’s the question that changed my life. What will I say to my creator..? What will be a good enough reason..? I wasn’t ready? I tried my best? Not good enough. \n\nHope U read this and it helps in some way  inshallah. At the moment Allah has kept some form of guilt in ur heart when u do something u knw isn’t right, don’t let that small portion be taken away from u. Act upon it before it’s taken away. It’s not too late. U have a daughter who will lead by ur example. True love means wanting jannah for those we love x
dear sisster if u coverd your head and body beang a muslim so remember  that islam doesn't allow u to show your face to na mehrem people
To all those people out there who live in Bradford hit the like button\n#hometown
Don’t yell at me, but your teeth look way better now! I hated it at first but they’ve settled..... or is it better lippy? You look GORGEOUS ❤️,
are your teeth different?
Could you make tutorial of your last Instagram busy mom look HIJAB style?
Thanks hats1976,yes I'm a multi millionaire lawful citizen, with 3000 guns,I would like to attend all that I can
Bruh if u have 42 guns u got a problem bruh
400 pounds up 30 floors, disables security, and fire alarms, removes 800 pounds of hurricane proof windows, reigns fire for 5-10 minutes, WITH NO MOTIVE, yup government did this
This is domestic terrorism but the media won't call him a terrorist.
The only way to stop these shootings from happening again is common sense gun control.
Will you let them rest my god. I'm sick of hearing about this. None of the news networks care about the people who died all they want is ratings and to exploit and profit from their deaths.
He wanted to be on the fbi most wanted list, like dad  who betrayed him and his family bank robbing
she very old woman she .my grandma just 55year's old she is 64..she is from Philippines..??
Notice the reporters head is perfectly covering the shot out windows? But why?
Why aren't reporters asking, why he chose a venue full of T🤡rump supporters, red necks and nationalist??? As he obviously didn't attack the other concerts full of hippies, minorities and gays!
BUMP-STOCK, bump-stock !! not quite so sexy .  IT'S A START !
more media bullshit, trying to take our minds off other questions...
This was far worse than September 11th, because it was no way an attack on government, but pure murder.
I live in Las Vegas it's was not only one shooter and why the news not showing or tell the people that there are 3 windows busted out on different floors
Go back to bed America. You are free to do as we tell you. -- BH
Yearly 30.000 Americans get killed by guns. More than in 44 European countries combined. The US also has the highest Infant mortality rate of all modern industry countries. America can be proud !!  👍
Government planned the attack.
This could be like that movie shooter ! Gov set uo
No rime or reason to this madness. Whatever his motives were he took along with him.
He wasn't alone in that hotel room. Media is hush about this
There's no shortage of conspiracy fuckwits posting in the comments. Sad.
Weapons aren't the problem. There is very manipulative, smart, evil people out there who will go through any means necessary to kill a large amount of people for no real reason at all.. Most people who do mass shootings like this are patient and they plan ahead, if we were to SOMEHOW stop EVERYONE from getting hands on a automatic rifle then these crazy people will just learn how to make Bombs to kill people instead. Getting things to make a rifle automatic is easier than learning how to make a decent sized bomb I presume, that's why we see more mass shootings than bombings in America because it's easier to use and buy a gun than it is to make a large bomb. Taking away guns nor making back round or mental checks is going to stop things like this from happening again, people with patients can do anything (good or bad). Its impossible to stop people from getting guns and it's impossible to know how people are going to use them.\n\nIf people out there really want things like this to stop happening ( which it won't, crazy people are everywhere) people need to realize that stoping individuals from buying any type of gun is going to do Absolutely Nothing.
That is pretty weird that multi millionaire would go on a shooting spree so randomly
Excuse me but I need to puke!! 😷 This makes me very sick.
NO! The CIA did
What a time to live in.
How sad! My thoughts and prayers go out to the victims. I knew some people and celebrities who attended the Life Is Beautiful Music Festival. Scary to think what he may have had planned for that Music Festival.
The type of people who used to rant about Pizza Gate now have a lot of theories about the Vegas shooting.
I think there was more than one shooter. Always will
Comments on videos like this remind how stupid so many people are
On 4chan weeks before the shooting an anonymous person warned against a big attack in Las Vegas. This man is a patsy. No motive because he wasn't motivated. He somehow carried 20 guns into a hotel room by himself. Many say there were two shooters. He was probably a gun runner and got used as a patsy, killed before the shooting ever took place. Look it up.
This title is annoying😂😂
Who chooses these events next to buildings like that how do you not see that as a security nightmare
the woman knows something  Hould her  till u get the true form her
My heart goes out to those in Vegas
Something definitely seems fishy about all of this. This has inside job written all over it
Why is a terrorist news channel trending ? Just more proof that Youtube is completely biased towards Democrat causes and fakes the whole trending thing. It's not an algorithm, it's the extreme leftists at Youtube manipulating views, likes and your perceptions.
No but his brother did.
God forbid but imagine if he had a Gernade launcher or other explosives
I'm still waiting on the footage of him checking in the hotel and walking around the casino to see if he had with anybody else (accomplice) with him.. there's no way he could have done this completely on his own
Sad to say... This topic will blow over in 2 weeks and we'll be talking about the kardashians again
This is very tragic, so is what's happening in Rosemont Illinois, with the young black lady that was found in the Crown Plaza hotel freezer, but no coverage on that,,,,,Smdh
Itsashley doesn't get it because she is a Democrat.
Anyone else think that was a belt-fed gun military grade and there's no way this guy could have done that sounds like he's a patsy for some big psyop operation
Never giving up my second amendment tho
AlJaazera im Disappointed in You Guys ,Im going back to RT
There are more the two shooters!!!! Show the countless videos with two distinct and different distance gun shots.  False flag for gun grab.
No one is talking about the woman who warned them they were going to die that night weird?
FAKE NEWS RELEASE THE HOTEL VIDEOS OF THE SHOOTER BRINGING ALL THOSE GUNS IN THE HOTEL OR THE SHOOTER WITH ALL THOSE SUIT BAGS 23 GUNS SMH IT DONT MAKING SENSE
Visit the channel if you want to access the straight path.\nvisit this channel to listen to Holy Quran the last book from the God!!to humanity.\nVisit the channel if you want to reach happiness and comfort ! In this life and the Hereafter.
Paddock was VERY wealthy. Did Paddock sell his SOUL to the DEVIL to have everything he ever wanted, in exchange for this violent act?
Chris rock was right!   whatever happened to crazy ? He had no motive except crazy!  I wish they'd stop mentioning scumbags name.
Y'all a little slow over there?
What if when he booked that hotel, he saw all the people and thats where he got the idea in the first place.
This is unacceptable let's drop some bombs on Afghanistan and teach them a lesson!!
What about the flashing lights on the 12th floor?? Plenty of videos showing it
Sin city
That's creepy, I was just at the Life Is Beautiful Festival last week and noticed people watching the festivities from the tall condo building.
Ha funny
she's lying
A.J., be the first network to demand the hotel security video footage, of him loading up the room with 20 AR modified full auto rifles.  and the entire 2 hour before- during -after hallway cam, on 32nd floor.  You could gain credibility as a network. simply demand the footage, till they turn it over.
Scripted.....
Madsteven
FALSE FLAG wake up America
Yes He did
omg...
Catalonia\nPalestine\nScotland\nKosovo\nKurdistan
She knew.
Sin City style
😔😔
🏴
la la muchi la la muchi midnight
Nobody died , no body cried 🐧
Multiple shooters
Al jazeere trending wtf
Bullshit news
FALSE FLAG
🚫BAN ALL BUMP STOCKS NOW!\nBAN ALL BUMP STOCKS NOW!🚫
Government set up
Al jazeera is ISIS propaganda
Western world hates women.
americans who support owning automatic  weapon - seem to have the wisdom of a conesnail
White guy killing white people.  No problem.   Great news.
Stupid whites always doing mass shootings
So the killer was 'white'. Hope you know that Trump.
if we don’t change gun regulation laws. this will only get worse.
stop referring to this terrorist as the gunman he is a terrorist say it a radical white terrorists
White policeman's jobs and not hard you're never in danger. When all your job is to do is shoot down black people you're not human
Where in the world can you find mass shooting become a regular occurence? Almost all shooters were white. But no one blamed their white families. Now you have a white shooter with a non-american, non-white girlfriend who is on the other side of the world when it happened and yet her photo is everywhere like she was the one holding the gun. Hmm.. something is NOT right.
Gun control..
What happened in real was an FBI weapon deal with ISIS went wrong, Isis found out paddocks with the government and decided to either take him hostage and carry out the shooting or killed him and carried out the shooting...wondering why they not releasing cctvs of the casino.? Imagine if the public find out that it was an FBI -ISIS weapon deal gone wrong. SO now that paddock is killed he became the suspect for a while until the videos of multiple shooters came out. WAKE UP PEOPLE
Such great jihad will take place in the next three weeks, and within a year, there will be at least five times, Pado, the great hero! Great holy warrior! Heaven has your place!
a 64 yearold man didnt carry 20k rounds of ammo and weapons up to his floor. plus one of his mental issues where from mk ultra. how i know? because various peoole who have been put threw it also had same issues.
wait! Isn't Al Jazera the terrorists main channel for getting their message out? Why is this allowed on YouTube?
Way to good statement I know philipinos don't talk the way that lawyer talked
Chance the rapper concert??all he does is help others tho!!
Conspiracy theories are simply a way for mouth breathing retards to feel like they're smart.
Terrorist. Terrorist. Terrorist
Why was she stacking her belongings on top of her as if she were moving, as reported by her neighbors

I adore him love this song and thank you so so so so much Kane Brown for the song if you get this commet I hope so. You are a credible singer hun.
can wait to see him at stage coach!!
I remember his set on Sunday afternoon, before everything ended so gruesomely. He definitely gave the crowd a great performance and I'm glad he's honoring the souls of those that didn't come out of Route 91 safe that night. I commend him for this, as much as it hurts to listen to music right now.
Heven is a lot better then this
I love his songs
Hey All I have done lyrics for this song, please head over to my channel to see it, if you like \nThank you, Kane keep up the good work
I love him and his voice😍😍
Love it and him😘😘😊😚😚🤗🤗🤗
I love this song omg your music puts me in the best mood I love it❤❤
Who's here before 1 mil?
TBH: This is officially the greatest song hes wrote!!
Whats up guys, if you get me to 300 subscribers i will give my dad 100$ and record it!
So handsome! I love his style, you don't see a country singer dressed like that often.
I was just listening to my recommended country videos and it's on auto-play. I am on Facebook, and I'm listening to this video and thought this is real country music. The singer has twang and sounds more country than other songs I have heard. I click back onto the YouTube video and I see he is of color and I thought Dang! He sings better than most COUNTRY singers. He is definitely in my top 5 country male artists.
Honestly am very impressed!!! I usually don’t like country music but his voice is so good
I didn't know you had to dress a certain way to be country.
Kane made me like country music again. I love his voice and he's so sexy.
This is his best song yet! His voice, the music, the lyrics...pure perfection!!! It’s been on repeat for me since it came out!
More fuck boy garbage.
Yoooo this niggas gettin me wet sl
Well, Love the song! Adore the artist! However...the lyrics, I do not like. How can Heaven be better? Two words, Jesus Christ!

Was that Jarret Sleeper aka Metal from MyMusic?
q u a l i t y   c o n t e n t
That's not the kind of dab I was expecting, lol.
This was lowkey kind of a garbage, cancerous video...... Sorry, Jack :/
That's why it took you ~10 years to get 3 million subs.
The perfect video doesn't exi-
Sadly the day after he died poor man drowned in pussy
Hacker - Got nerfed yesterday, as you know, you went jack to the future..

I love the dog staring the entire tome
The dog in the corner is the best part
the video is clearly looped. I'm seeing these comments people actually believe this??
Tag yourself\n\nI'm the Birkenstock tan lines on his feet
This is why I subscribed
What
Klondike was astounded
1.2 million views 50 second video.
I unsub for this...
STOP implying that pewdi stole your content :(
Wtf 😂

He has fucking Birkenstock tanlines
Oh hi doggy
Ahh! METAL!
Mmmmmm
Hot
Not slow enough

_Klondike behind the couch, staring at jack_
The dog just in the back like really.
Retarded
So cringy
can't believe I just watched this
My ad was longer than the video 😂
He's not fast enough
Bambam is going to have to step up his game.
Well darn, the big boy did it. He diddly-done did it.
The way your dog looks at you with disappointment is how I hope my kids look at me one day when I do cringey memes.
Shit I looked away. Did he do it??
How does this video compare with other YouTube videos you have watched this week?\n\n☑︎ One of the best videos\n☐ A great video\n☐ About average\n☐ Below Average\n☐ One of the worst videos
I watched a 15 second ad for this? ... Worth it.
This is the funniest criticism I have ever seen😂😂😂😂
I want to die. Dabbing is the worst fucking trend to ever exist! I love Jacksfilms, but I cant stand watching this. I have never dabbed and fuck whoever does it
anyone else notice the tan lines on his feet (they look like they're from sandals)
can he do it;can he finish the dab,i don't think so and neither does anyone else; fuck him XD
Can we have an unedited version?
100k likes in 2 days... MY GOD YOU ARE A GENIUS!!!!!
This video made me feel uncomfortable.
His fucking dog looking at him like what the actual fuck Jack
Wtf did I just watch?
I really hope you do more skits like these, this was pretty clever. Top 10 videos with Erik are the best too
He’s getting a Vac van
amazing
Fuk meh
oh
?
Wtf Jack...
When the dab is so good a dog comes to watch :-)
Lol the birkenstocks tan on his feet
I can do better
This will eventually turn normies into in un-normies ,or they will take the awesome pickle Rick memes and turn it into normie meme.
I just wasted 58 seconds of my life, watching Jack dab..,..
look behind the chair.
Did he win the million though?
The dab is dead
0:33 FUCK U HE CAN DO IT
i loved the millionaire music
2016 called, it really wants to keep dabs in the vicinity of its time-line, and every time a person does a dab a baby rabbit gets snatched up by a hawk. The longer you do it, the longer the pain and torture of the baby rabbit until its demise. Donate at least 1 cent to the stop the dab foundation STDF in short, to really make a change in our unintelligent, thought dwindling, baby booming psychotic society.
i'll only be impressed if he does it for an hour
obviously fake, there's no way.
*who wants to be a millionaire music plays*
Some things were not made to exist
Is this the prequel-sequel to My Longest Yeah Boy Ever
I can do it better
Well I just wasted 58 seconds of my life
i think drugs are involved. he cheated.
*Confirmed: Jacksfilms Takes Preformance-Enhancing Drugs*\nIn a recent stunt _My slowest, longest dab_, the popular YouTuber jacksfilms dabbed for 50 seconds! This sounds inspiring to upcoming dabbers, but when you find that he took a drug test and it was positive, all respect is lost.\nBy: Raendum Equlz Foonii
Can you please get a world record for the longest and lowest dab?
Hey jack, how did it feel to be in that diss track on ricegum?

Its really wired because the first time i used the maybelline fit me concealer my face burnt so bad and i was that dumb i kept on using it but after like the 10th time using it, it stopped burning.
I LOVE THIS DO MORE!!!!!!!
That mask burned the shit out of my skin and left me looking sun burnt the rest of the day :(((
Loving this and loving you 👏🏽🌱💛✨
I noticed how YouTuber beauty gurus are super careful about what they say about tarte products because tarte is quick to snatch people off their PR list these days even if it's constructive criticism
I miss your old hair!
I love watching your vids, they put me in a good mood😻
You are looking amazing!
Thanks Michael for your honesty, I truly appreciate it. It saves me going out and buying a crappy product!
You’re makeup today is ridiculous 😍
He looks like Ursula from the little mermaid
Almost died laughing a the review of the Natasha palette ..... A lot of persons seem to be like they are walking on eggshells when doing a hit or miss....best of all time
You look fabulous! I love your honest opinions!!
The fact that you admit you got a product in PR & STILL state your honest opinion .. respect 🙌🏻 love you !

😍😍😍
Loveyou
YOURE SO STUNNING😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥

Omg I so so love your makeup vidz your so amazing
That Mecca primer is an EXACT dupe for the Becca backlight primer... I compared the two today and the Mecca one had just a teeeensy bit more pink pigment to it. But they pretty much look, perform, smell the same except one costs nearly $80 and the other costs $20. Ps they both have 30mls of product
I just loves you! Xx
Love u so much Michael! U should review the fenty beauty range! xoxo
I love it when you do favourites videos I always value your opinions on beauty products 💖💖 love ya
That makeup look with that hair.. yas mama!👏
Giving me Katy Perry but 100x better!!!
You legit look like Pink the singer with that hair I can't deal
That little “HMM” after the pro glow concealer 😂😂😂
Could you do a full face first impressions on sports girl makeup. I really like watching your first impressions love you ❤️❤️
Yaaas the Lancôme has been my fave for years! It's the best!
Thank you I love your videos ❤️

Love your hit or miss videos!! Keep them coming!!!
You look so good Michael 😍
Looking good girl.   ....But I really hate these YT vids that are just basically adverts for cosmetic companies.
fucking living for your honesty with these products, it's so helpful
So much shit Aussies cant buy... story of our lives 😐
You can buy physicians formula at Priceline in chermside ✌🏼
I love you Michael💕💕💕
I love how honest he is!!!!! If you don’t then CYA! Q, ROCK ON
Im in the UK and I have used those grapefruit wipes.. oh my they stung like a bitch! Never again! Great video as always :)
ok but why does he look exactly like my mom if she had blond hair and makeup skills?
I don't like it, I fucking hate it. CYA! Holy shit I died 😂😂
The neutrogena facial wipe are only met for your face on the back of the packaging it says not to use around eyes.
Hell yes with that physicians formula contour palette. I use the middle shade as well and its the first thing I have used that completely mimics an actual shadow on my face. And for $14.99 you can't beat it.
I miss your silver hair doll!!!
Why in the hell do u not have 1mil
love the lesbian look
I feel like so many beauty channels shy away from saying negative things about the brand TARTE and I appreciate how honest you are about why you didnt like the product... (i.e. not just bashing a brand or product but giving a reason behind it so we as consumers can see if the product might not be a good purchase for us!) Sending love from the U S of A lol
The burning with the makeup remover wipes happened to me too!
' I don't like it, I fucking hate it, move on, cya ' 😂😂😂😂
Yes i want to see more hits and miss!!
 I dont like it, i fuckin hate it, move on, cyyyaa  😂😂💀 when I tell you I laughed way too hard
I always love seeing these kinds of videos, please do more like this!
Your hair looks amazing in this !
I love your fucking hair😍💋
Any other youtubers wanna support each other? Comment if you do!💕
Omg!!!! Please please please please please please please please please do some tutorials using the Sephora warm pro palette....it’s soooooo beautiful!
Your makeup is stunning. Love the eyes.
watching you daily is a MUST qqqq
You're the definition of seductive, don't fuck with me, I own fall, look. 😍
Every time I watch a tutorial or a video and someone says that the L'Oréal pro glow concealer burns their under eyes.. I'm like WHY DOES THAT NOT HAPPEN TO ME. It's literally my fave, I wear it everyday mixed with tarte shape tape ( the glowy concealer helps hydrate my undereyes while the shape tape provides the coverage I need) I WISH IT WORKED FOR U BC WE BOTH LOVE SHAPE TAPE AND I KNOW YOUD LOVE TO MIX THEM
What's the shimmer on your eyes? 😍😍❤️
‘Rock on’

No sabia que la paty maldonado era youtuber
Why all focus on Laptops? Why not a Mac mini type desktop?
Google is trying to become APPLE with way out of price hardware.   NEWS FLASH,  THE reason we HATE APPLE is because their overprice hardware.   Miss the days of the NEXUS.       NEXUS is awesome and swell,  but Pixel can go to
There's a million people in the comment section going what is the point of this? Well, I'm currently using a laptop with Ubuntu, and 90% of the time I'm in a web browser. This machine can run a real Ubuntu installation via Crouton, can run Android apps, can be used like a tablet and has a true stylus for drawing/notetaking. I was looking into a Dell XPS 13 and a tablet, but this + Pixel Pen actually does more than either, costs slightly less and looks fantastic. This is basically the Compaq TC1100 done right.
Hey, look a headphone jack. I thought Google was getting away from those. 😑
When you touch the screen, it shakes a lot. It crazy stupid.
okay yeah... but can it run Crysis?
I honestly really like Chromebooks especially for typing up papers and doing research, they're pretty inexpensive and work great with my Google Account I've actually used my Chromebook more than my laptop during school times to each their own I guess.
should cost 500-600$ for the i5 8gb 128gb to compete with the ipad line not the windows or mac laptops
i though Apps is EOL pretty soon? Google keep pushing progressing web app, how can web end in the future??\ni dont get it.
I don't understand why people are always like spending x amount of money for this piece of tech is stupid. First of all, you don't have to buy it. Secondly, why do you care what someone else buys with their money if it has no effect on you? Get a life.
Its a chrome book and has 10 hours of battery life, for 1000$. Really? You get that type of battery on Macbooks running Mac OS X. I'd expect better for something running Chrome OS.
this guy is sweet lol
Guys, rub Anyone  know larger  this vgrsion
google and its bezels.....
I prefer the word Surface to Pixel because a Surface is greater than just a Pixel...
Hope the guys at Google will make a  Pixel Tab ....
For the price of this.. I'd rather get a Microsoft Surface Pro laptop
i'de buy this if can run autocad, photoshop, sketchup and 3dsmax! ^^
Very basic usage. All that you can do with your phone. There is no point google competing this market segment, they will never get the mass with laptops. Google is all about mobile phones and their leading role in the market is undisputed.
Are we heading to a place where Chromebooks eventually run Android?
This video definitely warmed me more to the device, it's pretty much the production tablet that android always promised but failed to deliver.  But damn that price is just .. high  - have they forgotten that they're competing with the Surface Pro?  I don't understand anyone that'd pick this over a Surface Pro when the price difference is negligible.
how many times has that pen dropped through the table gaps in the making of this video?
I see the price dropping on this in future. 
*A $1000 for a browser No thanks Google*
*WANNA HEAR A JOKE*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*CHROME OS*
Still a waste ! Nobody's buying Chromebooks !
My old Nexus 10 has a higher res screen. Feels good man.
Can it run (insert any pro app)? Oh ok 😒✌️. Crazy over priced for what it's capable of doing in real world use. Specs and design are irrelevant if you can't do much with it. May as well get an android tablet. Don't buy something on the promise of what it MIGHT be able to do in the future.
Dang, I wish I had waited before buying a Samsung Chromebook Pro earlier this year! This thing clearly has better specs and subjectively is much more attractive than the Samsung. Then again, would it really do that much more as a Chromebook?
My Acer Chromebook works fine for $240. I'm all set.
if Google would release a google branded version of desktop linux on a chromebook and get developers interested in developing more mainstream apps for linux (photoshop, etc) then this would DESTROY apple and wintel machines
The pixelbook looks awesome as it is really suite for a terminal use. The ability of running android app makes it good for light-weighted entertainment need. It would be a plus if it is detachable, but i'm OK with current design. The only drawback to me is the price is too high compare to other Windows as it lacks the ecosystem windows established.
Can we write a letter\sentences (in English) and have something convert it like OCR.
100% copy of the Microsoft Surfacebook and that Pen is all a copy of Microsoft. Hp Spectre looks very similar, too. No SD card slot. Lol. 😂 🤣
It is as sexy as useless.
God damn those bezels are huge. If you buy this and want to resell it down the road good luck convincing someone to pay you a fraction of the cost.
No!! It's ridiculous and expensive... It's only for rich dumb kids!!! No thanks!!!
Everything is book now a days
Seriously, who wants a touchscreen on their laptops? I will never get it, screen wobbles, it gets fingerprint smudges in no time, and you'll always be more precise with a mouse anyway.
well if phones cost 1000 dollars now, why not this laptop just because there are companies out there making extremely over priced products does not mean every procuct should be over priced dipshit. What a terrible video.
How does this compare to Samsung Chromebook Pro?
Can you say thermal throttle???  You will never see high performance from chip
chrome os is famous for and hallmarked by its lightweight and affordable. fulfilling people's simplest and most labored daily task, like tediously typing, web browsing, sometimes video streaming and light gaming--I don't do games even on my smartphones but people do, many folks would compensate and yield some laptop's functionalities for a little bit better experience of basic performance, I think that's understandable because I tried several chrome books before and they all performed well in terms of aforementioned things. however, misjudging from their ideal concept that people will buy some so-called high-end Chromebooks they are fond of in the past is just an absolute mistake. personally, for instance, I only do care Chromebooks because it is cheap and stable performance, therefore I would not even have a glimpse of thinking to buy a Chromebook if the price is barely equal to a real laptop, let alone this pixel book's astronomical overpriced AF. aesthetically, this book is gorgeous looking but that's it. unless chrome os or, you could generally say android app store can evolve someday to catch up with windows os, there will never be any reasonable logics to get a Chromebook over a real laptop at this price, ever.
for what is the storage if you cant download movies on it or use with applikations like Android. there are some Android Apps that support RAW files example LR or PS.
Why does a Chromebook need an i7? Who would spend $1600 on a Chromebook?
One thing that people fail to notice is the longevity of these things. Yes they are not as productive as Windows or Mac, but they will easily last you for 7+ years without stuttering on what they do.
Don’t understand why you wouldn’t compare it to the existing laptop books on the market. Also the pricing is a bit extreme, you can get an XPS, Surface Pro, our MacBook for close to the same price.
Does the Chromebook support Photoshop the same as Windows ?
Biased ... why is he not mentioning the damn screen, and mos def the humongous bezel!
if it only was run by Win10.....
Why put a mobile grade i7 into basically an enlarged android with few extra features. No one is gonna render their video or play graphically intense game on this. Although I do dig the aesthetics
Why an i7? What possibly could you do within chromeOS that needs that power?
Like he said, if a phone can cost $1000, then why not a Chromebook? I can see this being amazing in the future.
now I can play cool math games at 144 fps
Am I the only one drooling over the fact that it has the potential to become an amazing Linux convertible?
Do you reckon I could play pc games on that thing? 😂
Isn't it annoying when you touch the display and it bounces back like that all the time?
I want it give me pls ;-;
Is this video an ad for google? It sounds like one especially with all the new google-products placed. Smells like product placement.
Looks neat! But the price...
that glass surface looks good
what about strength and durability?
Am i the only one who feels like if the ChromeOS is perfected and can run Android apps smoothly then Windows is in trouble?
Always some compromise or another. Missing SD card slot and too powerful (yes) CPU. The Acer Chromebook R13 get +12h worth of battery life with a Mediatek ARM CPU. It's powerful enough for Chrome OS. The Samsung Chromebook Plus is half the price (but is unfortunately not sold in many regions) and still carries a stylus, can be used as a tablet, etc.
If it can't run Adobe,\nthen it ain't fo me.
Great product your presentation is fantastic just the perfect balance between facts and your expert opinion.
Can anyone plz tell me that, whether a video editor can be installed on the pixelbook... like final cut pro or similar software
Why use an x86 processor? If you want the best combination of power and efficiency, then ARM is the way to go.
What's with that glossy screen?
If I cannot do development on that Device, I am not buying.
That bezel can handle a Aircraft
That's one sexy lappy🙄
Google Pixelbook first look.. good
Preview wonderful
Me love this gargle fixal stuff
I think the reason why Google chose to do this is because this is their way of revamping the Pixel C and the Chromebook Pixel 2 in one product. That price though. $1,650 for the maxed out model. The second option of the base Macbook costs $1,599.00.
I have sold countless laptops and the biggest question to ask yourself when trying to understand a product before selling it is: who would buy this and why? I have not come up with any answers for this laptop other than: an idiot and because they’re stupid. i5/128gb for $1000? It must have great design and build quality then! Oh wait nvm look at those huge bezels and chrome OS? What a joke.
No multitasking with an i7 and 16 gb or ram? Lmao...
Too wide of a bezel for laptops in 2017, and a pretty much useless kind of laptop that revolves around the world of Google Chrome browser alone. Remix OS (which is an Android-based desktop computing OS) is still way better than Chrome OS. Not gonna compare this to Windows because that would be unfair. Chrome OS does not even beat a laptop operating on Windows Vista.
About as useless as an iPad is. There's no reason to have a fast desktop-class processor just so you can run dumbed down mobile apps designed for fat fingers.
It's great... for a Chromebook.
The design is wow! It's better than pixel 2 design. But.... Still I think not good for most people from inside
$99 on a pen! B R U H
Beautiful laptop, but sad is runs Chrome OS.
if your 2k$ pc don't run all games due to odd software, PASS!
The Surface Pro keyboard is 1.3 mm travel...
WHY?! Why not throw windows on it. I would throw my money at google. Stop pusing chrome OS, its for emerging markets and low end laptops, not a powerhouse laptop like this.
They Get Paid To Say All The Nice Things About Google.
Overpriced laptop with unusable OS.

Hey Mikey you should come back Xi'an and give us a tour of what it's like and all of your child hood foods that aren't served here in the US
I'll have to research good Xi'an places here in Vancouver. It seems like my kind of food!!!
Xi'an is Chang'an ? \n\nThe city of Empress Wu ?
I can only watch your videos when I'm eating because I get so hungry watching you
You can have love without marriage and you can have marriage without love.
I recognized this place immediately! When I was in La I went here with my family. How cool.
I've gone to the same plaza many times, but I've never seen that restaraunt lol
Never end a video in a low note
i feel fat watching this
YO\nI LIVE IN THAT AREA
3:04 food porn...
bruh look like budget jackie chan
slurp...sluuuurrppp.... mieeennn noodle...! thats a chinese burger, so delicious, with lamb,pork, Thats WOW,i think! i never try this
Slimy food
Broccoli
Great
I love you Mikey, but please stop sticking your chopsticks in your bowls! 😂
COME TO THE FLINDERSTREET CAFE!!!!!!!!
Next thing u know the white pepper is salt
I am glad that Xi'an Garden is pretty authentic. \n\nMy girlfiend and I love that place!
You always like everything. How much they pay you?
Mike-e you are the best ! I live an hour from Los Angeles, and i'm going to try to visit the first place you went to in honor of you. I will show my waiter the foods and hopefully they will be able to bring me those, just how you had them. Keep keeping on. Much Support from a happy mother of four, that looks at your videos on her free time.
Mike you should come to Bangladesh. You would love the cuisine here.
Great videos Mikey!  I especially liked your visit to Shirokiya in the Ala Moana Shopping Center...my favorite stop.  Next time you're in town, you gotta try their Kulu Kulu custard filled pastry....onolicious!  Thanks for the tours!  Aloha!
The food looks so good that I actually got chills while watching it!😁😌
Those steamed noodles in the second place sound right up my alley.
Mark Wiens has a million subscribers; and the Food Ranger just reached one million subscribers.  Time to get this channel to one million subscribers as well.   It would be dope if you would do a collaboration with the Both of them.  I think it would definitely get you over that million mark.
You're in my area!
How sad, disepointed, destroyed, mad, upset, lifethretendly hart broken would he have been if there would have been western broccoli in the soup.
BUT WHEN IS MIKE ACTUALLY GONNA GO TO CHINA
That place is 28 miles from my house. Guess where I'm going Saturday. Thanks
I just moved from LA to Little Fort, Canada and I'm already missing the food
Come to malaysia when raya fest i show you how malaysian eat
for the 200 of you guys that dislike this video ... you all dont know good food when you see it ..
try the kitchen sink at fair oaks pharmacy in south pasadena east of los angeles!
@13:35 No stuffed sneezes so your not full!
The noodles are my favorite
No buddy cares if you go round  their restaurant
Loved your videos. Keep it up. You are a legendary eater food lover
if this is your random free day, when do you ever have a real free day? 😂 thanks for entertaining us with your videos!
Anyone know what the places are called
I miss Xi'an food so much after this vedio
Makes me miss China already.
Love your honest reviews, thanks for keeping it real! You da best Mike!
Your hind leg is rising up LOL
You would like more pork on the back of your bun???  9:00
Making this video available in Colorado where nothing close to Xian food is available, is a crime
Get out of LA wtf!!!    Find something with ambience and class.    You are losing it bub!!!!
I'm hungry, i want to eat
Those gooey noodles look amazing....wish I knew how to cook something like that
Spicy means burning butt when on the toilet 🚽
I do the same thing whenever I eat food from my country, especially specialized regional and provincial cuisine..
U should go New Orleans and go to try the special number 2 which is from Orchards Ramen restaurant.
That is not soup, its jello.
please try Filipino foods...  :)   love your videos...  the secret taste of every food I eat!!!!  stay cool!!!
Mike, make a Live Stream 🤤
Oh my god, I miss the food
this channel always makes me hungry
Definitely one thing I miss about LA is the MASSIVE variety of foods you can get.
Can you try Japanese food in LA? Cindy’s kitchen was 2 minutes away. Can you do a meetup at Westfield Santa Anita?
Hi Mike, when you order several dishes, do you eat all of them at one sitting or do you taste each and take the rest home...smile
Mike, I am so happy you got a taste of home! That is an important thing for people who have moved far from the the place they grew up. And thank you for the education! Watching your videos has taught me a great deal about places and cultures that I am not familiar with.
Would love to see you go to Xian
Mike omg I'm so happy I did not know you had this channel, I love Beyond Science. You are the man!
I can give you a few places to eat at since your in my home town
Did he say my wife's friends recommended it
It's a motel for Chinese food
The consistency of the soup looks like snot. 😶
You should  try the hat in la  san Gabriel yum good  eatting
Hot oil is king !
The first place’s liangpi looks way too thick.
Mike [Talking about a lamb soup]: I mean a cow can't survive without grass right?. Ummmmm haha. Love you Mike!
aha I am from xi'an too，jusy feeling homesick so much right now
How old are you then 30?
I LOVE MUSLIM PEOPLE N THEIR FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!

So happy kodak's verse wasn't on this video, man his voice is annoying.
A boogie is the type of nigga you catch doing his homework
Damn this was a fire ass video😭production amazing
So they just put that one part in so they could promote a new song and cover for Kodak not being there
How can he sing under water so good ???? Props 👏
I can't 😭😭😭 this is perfection 😍💪
why did he cut Kodak Black part?
What is the name of the song from the lol video they put on Kodak part?
Video, music, creativity qualities are godly, yet he’s more underrated than Yatchy, Uzi and 21, passhhh
How is he talking underwater
This is so cool
I thought Kodak black was singing....
This is the dopest video I ever seen and ima Pac fan!!!
HOW IS HE ABLE SO SING A WHOLE SONG AND NOT DIE
All New Orleans niggas singing this rn. 😂😂😂
Thank God this isn't the one with Kodak
This video is so artistically well done looks pretty real with the effect done on him.
Aboogie couldn't save kodak for his verse

Hey Mama Hanz!🤗 This is my 3rd Hanzoween and I LOVE your work! Its so detailed and you always learn something by the end!

I don't know why, but black lipstick is sexy af
I'm so happy to have watched the two of you together :) The two of you are amazing to watch absolutely amazing artists and can't wait to see if you both collab agin through out the month of hanzoween..... :)
Literally thought Jordan was Jaclyn Hill in the thumb nail! 😬
The Lady who played Chucky looks more like Tiffany tho lol
There aren’t enough thumbs on YouTube for how much I like this video
Jordan looks like a scary but somehow still pretty Jennifer Lawrence 😂 and Kristi is a bad ass as always
I loved this video😍😍😍😍

Love tge attention to detail!
😂😂😂 love you girlssss
Chuckys scars are on the wrong side XD
Is the pros aide cream essential and also how is the alcone 3rd degree going over your brow, do you cover the jar to protect it? Thank you, hoping to recreate for Halloween! 🎃 💗 👻 p.s. love you and your videos you're AMAZING!!
I HAVE to try this for Halloween this year. Like I'm in love with your take on it. Whenever you were searching for the on Amazon what did you search? Because I've searched red/orange wigs and I they're all like waaaay to red or way to orange
Aw, Rawbeautykristi is teeny tiny - or are you tall Jordan? Love your collabs! :) x
Im curious about your lip piercing.. I want one it's so cute! Does it hurt? Is it in the way? Did it hurt to do it? How was the healing time? What kind of jewellery have you in it?
Some advice for the freckles: dont mix eyeshadow with water ! The water will evaporate and leave powder which will move around and be dirty looking. (Trust me, i learned the hard way). Use a mixing liquid or setting spray instead.
He's kind of a warm ass bitch lmao, please do more collabs!! :-D
My children are a gift- TO ME!\n- Todd in the Shadows, 2k16
This song doesn't take advantage of his incredible voice. He tries too hard in this song to appeal to the gen pop, so...meh.

An ok song, but it's not old Lukas, it's too much pop, not enough original Lukas. But still the best voice in the world
was a great song to end the movie
Just the movie today, it was SO AWESOME!\n#MyLittlePonyMovie\nMy only real complaint was during the pirate introduction, there wasn't really any background other than how they used to be.\nOther than that, one of the greatest ever made by mankind! (Or ponykind, or bronykind... whatever you prefer).

Just for anyone who wants to sing the lyrics\n\nWe wanna stay\nBut can't find peace while sitting still\nI guess we never will\nWe're on the way\nWe won't hurry back again\nThe journey is the end\n\nI love this very moment\nWe're speeding up not slowing\nWe might know we can't win\nBut we're dumb enough to try\nWe're going, there's no maybe\nThat's why they call us crazy\nAnd we'll say if anybody asks us\n\nHey, where you gonna go\nWe're off to see the world\nWe don't need to know, oh\nHey, where you gonna go\nWe're off to see the world\nWe don't need to know\n\nWe never need to know\nSeeking boundaries to break\nLet's forget the ones we've made\nSo we carry on\nDon't let good things pass us by\nThe time we're gone will be the\nBest time of our life\n\nI love this very moment\nWe're speeding up not slowing\nWe might know we can't win\nBut we're dumb enough to try\nWe're going, there's no maybe\nThat's why they call us crazy\nAnd we'll say if anybody asks us\n\nHey, where you gonna go\nWe're off to see the world\nWe don't need to know, oh\nHey, where you gonna go\nWe're off to see the world\nWe don't need to know\n\nSo go tell 'em we won't stop\nWe know they can't change us\nWe're gonna go way off the map\nTo get ourselves back on the track\nGo tell 'em we won't stop\nWe know they can't change us\nNo need to worry so much\nWe do whatever we want, oh\n\nHey, where you gonna go\nWe're off to see the world\nWe don't need to know, oh\nHey, where you gonna go\nWe're off to see the world\nWe don't need to know
My husband and I have been married over 17 years, and so many people questioned us getting married so young. When you know, you know. Two kids and several compromises later, we’re still planning out the rest of our life. I just sent this song to him.
who is here because Ed wrote the song?
Great song...was married to my ❤ my 🌎 met him when i was 14 im 45 now. Married 15 yrs...then he got killed in a head on collision Sept 23 2015.  Hes forever my 💔  and still my 🌎..
Been married 52 years and 3 children, 1 waiting for us in heaven. Years of magic, love, hardship, sickness, forgiveness, compromise, support, happiness, tears, wonder, dreams, and more love.
Omg these two when   they sing incredible    beautiful   ,amazing , it gives me chills, I can't   wait for   the ablum . ...

can't get enough of the song
(JESUS; THE ALMIGHTY!!!):\n\nAnd I saw heaven opened,\nand behold a white horse; \n\nand he that sat upon him\nwas called Faithful and True,\n\nand in righteousness \nhe doth judge \nand make war.\n\nHis eyes were as a flame of fire, \n\nand on his head were many crowns;\n\nand he had a name written, \nthat no man knew, \nbut he himself.\n\nAnd he was clothed with \na vesture dipped in blood:\n\nand his name is called\n\nThe Word of God.\n\n(Revelation 19:11-13). \n_________________________________________________\n\nBehold,\n\nhe cometh with clouds; \nand every eye shall see him, \n\nand they also which pierced him:\n\nand all kindreds of the earth \nshall wail because of him.\nEven so, Amen.\n\nI am Alpha and Omega, \nthe beginning and the ending, \n\nsaith the Lord,\n\nwhich is, \nand which was, \nand which is to come,\n\nthe Almighty.\n\n(Revelation 1:7-8). \n________________________________________________\n(JESUS):\n\nI am he that liveth,\nand was dead;\n\nand, \nbehold, \n\nI am alive for evermore, \n\nAmen;\n\nand have the keys \nof hell \nand of death.\n\n(Revelation 1:18). \n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(The world is going to hate us, because we follow Jesus. We follow and obey our Righteous King in our actions and deeds and the world hates us for it, because we don't form ourselves and obey the fallen king of this present world which is Satan):\n\n(Jesus):\n\nIf the world hates you,\n\nye know that\nit hated me\nbefore it hated you.\n\n(John 15:18).\n\n***(Hated Me): The world hated Him, so it should not be surprising that the world hates His followers.\n\n***(James 4:4)<---Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.\n\n***(1 John 2:15)<---Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\n\n***(Luke 6:26)<---Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(Build your house with Jesus, on the rock, and you will never sink, that's (IF) we continue to Keep his Commandments, we will bear MUCH FRUIT!):\n\n(Jesus):\n\nAbide in me,\nand I in you.\n\nAs the branch\ncannot bear fruit of itself,\nexcept it abide in the vine;\n\nno more can ye,\nexcept ye abide in me.\n\n(John 15:4).\n\n***For the branch to produce more fruit, it must abide, which means to dwell, to stay, to settle in, to sink deeper. The way to abide in Christ is to OBEY.\n\n***(John 15:10)<---If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.\n\n***(1 John 3:24)<---And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.\n\n***The believer who lovingly OBEYS the Word of God produces much fruit.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(Christ answers Philip, on himself and the Father as One. God manifested in the FLESH!):\n\nPhilip saith unto him, Lord,\n\nshew us the Father, \nand it sufficeth us.\n\nJesus saith unto him,\n\nHave I been so long time with you, \nand yet hast thou not known me, \nPhilip?\n\nhe that hath seen me \nhath seen the Father;\n\nand how sayest thou then, \nShew us the Father?\n\nBelievest thou not that\n\nI am in the Father, \nand the Father in me?\n\nthe words that I speak unto you \nI speak not of myself:\nbut (the Father)\nthat (dwelleth) (in me),\nhe doeth the works.\n\n(John 14:8-10).\n\n***(Revelation 21:3)<---And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the (tabernacle of God) is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and (God himself) shall be with them, and (be their God).\n\n***(Revelation 1:8)<---(Jesus)<----I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, (((the Almighty))).\n\n***The Lord rebuked Philip because he should have known the answer to the question he asked.\n\n***(He who has seen Me has seen the Father): The Lord patiently explained again that He was revealing God the Father to them in verse 7. It is impossible to escape the claim Jesus was making. Clearly, He was claiming to be God!
Cryinggggg!!! 😭😭😭❤❤❤❤❤ It's so beautiful 💋❤❤❤!!!
Such a beautiful song!! Also cool that Ed Sheeran wrote it

Comment no. 51\nThe closest I'll get to 1\nGreat song by great people ❤
Want to know for sure that you are going to Heaven when you die? (and everyone dies)  \n\nJesus is the Son of the Living GOD.  The only true GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth and there can only be ONE God that actually created everything, not many... \n\nJesus Died, was Buried and Rose from the dead on the third day, proving He is GOD.\n\nJesus said in John 14:6; Jesus said to him, “I am The Way, The Truth, and The Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.”  NKJV\n\nActs 4:12 states; Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name [Jesus] under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.  NKJV\n\nJesus said in John 3:16-17; For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world (YOU) that He even gave His One and only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him as Savior shall not perish, but have eternal life.  For God did not send the Son into the world to judge and condemn the world, that is, to initiate the final judgment of the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.  AMP\n\nJesus said in John 3:3; I assure you and most solemnly say to you, unless a person is Born Again, reborn from above, spiritually transformed, renewed, sanctified, he cannot ever see and experience the kingdom of God.  AMP\n\nRomans 10:9-11 states; that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.  NKJV\n\nRomans 10:13 states; For “whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”  NKJV\n\n1 Corinthians 15:1-5 states; Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, 2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you—unless you believed in vain.  3 For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ Died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was Buried, and that He Rose Again the third day according to the Scriptures, 5 and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.  NKJV\n\nAnd REPENT...\n\nActs 17:30 Therefore God overlooked and disregarded the former ages of ignorance; but now He commands all people everywhere to REPENT [that is, to change their old way of thinking, to regret their past sins, and to seek God’s purpose for their lives].  AMP\n\nJesus said in Mark 1:15 “The [appointed period of] time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; REPENT [change your inner self—your old way of thinking, regret past sins, live your life in a way that proves REPENTANCE; seek God’s purpose for your life] and believe [with a deep, abiding trust] in the good news [regarding salvation].”  AMP\n\n1 John 3:10 In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.  NKJV\n\nFrom what I have read we know how 8 of Jesus' disciples died and all 8 of those 8 chose death rather than to simply state that Jesus had not actually rose from the dead, that they were just lying, we made it all up.  Think about that!  Would you ever choose to be murdered to maintain a complete LIE?  No you would not.  You would say “ok, ok, it was a lie”.  They would not deny their Lord to keep this life because they knew they have eternal life in Jesus because they saw Him raised from the dead.\n\nPlease get in a quiet and alone place SOON and pray to Jesus that He show you somehow if these things above are true.  If you are sincere, He will answer you…\n\nAnd don’t ever forget just as there is a GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth there is also a devil, a Satan that hates God and everything God as ever made and that means he Hates YOU and wants to deceive and trick you into believing ANYTHING except Jesus and His salvation through the cross.  Though we should never fear for God is in complete control even when we have to walk through pain in this life for a season and the devil will soon be forever in his torment and punishment.\n\nSome great scriptures to look up and read below:\n\n1 Corinthians 6:9-11\n1 Corinthians 15:1-4\n1 John 3:7-15\nMicah 6:8\nActs 17:3\nActs 18:5\nJohn 4:25-26\nMark 14:61-62\nRevelation chapters 20-22\nThe entire New Testament
I love you guys.... You guys are so cute
I've always loved them as a couple. Had the pleasure of seeing them both in concert. This song tho is beautiful

Wow, I am speechless. I can't imagine how they felt recording this. What a powerful song, with an amazing meaning. And I love it. You know that this is powerful and full of compassion and love.

One of their best duets, so good <3
[Verse 1: Tim McGraw]\nSitting with you in a dark room\nWarm by a fireplace\nYou know there's just something about you\nYou brighten my day\nI got something to run past you\nI just hope i say it right\nSo I take your hand and ask you\nHave you made plans for the rest of your life?\n\n[Chorus: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]\nThere's one thing I should be giving up, giving up now\n\nAnd that's worryin' about life\nOh, I'll be fine\nIf one gray hair shows, i'll be fine\nIf my waistline goes, i'll be fine\nEven if time takes its toll\nWe'll stay young for the rest of our lives\n\n[Verse 2: Faith Hill]\nI've been making plans for children\nSince I've been looking in your eyes\nI even have names picked out for them\nDaughter; it'd be Rose\nSon; it'd be ___?\n\n[Chorus: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]\nThere's one thing I should be giving up, giving up now\nAnd that's worrying about life\nOh, I'll be fine\n\nIf one gray hair shows, I'll be fine\nIf my waistline goes, I'll be fine\nEven if time takes its toll\nWe'll stay young for the rest of our lives\n\n[Bridge: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]\nI don't really care about those storm clouds brewing\nOh, as long as you're hear by my side\nOh, we'll be young, oh we'll be young\nOh, we'll be young, when we're old\n\n[Chorus: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]\nOh, I'll be fine\nIf my gray hair shows, I'll be fine\nIf my waistline goes, I'll be fine\nEven when time takes its toll\nI'll stay young for the rest of my life\nWith you, I'll stay young for the rest of my life\nWith you\nWe'll stay young for the rest of our life

Omgggggg
How the fuck is this.not top.#1 trending. Probably because it's not some pop shit from some talentless pop star like shitlor swift mily syres or shitsten beybur or no direction or that girl with the ponytail and the Starbucks last name Ariel grand or whatever. Country stuff never makes the top trending. Last thing talented that got the top trending I can remember wasn't that long ago because it was talented Katy Perry with her great newer song swish swish

(The Great and terrible Day of the Lord. When Jesus comes back to take up his bride and punish the UNREPENTANT Sinners of this Earth. Those that trample the blood of Jesus under foot):\n\nFor the stars of heaven \nand the constellations thereof \n\nshall not give their light:\nthe sun shall be darkened \n\nin his going forth,\nand the moon shall not \ncause her light to shine.\n\nAnd I will punish the world for their evil, \nand the wicked for their iniquity;\n\nand I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease,\nand will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.\n\nI will make a man more precious than fine gold; \neven a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.\n\nTherefore I will shake the heavens,\nand the earth shall remove out of her place,\n\nin the wrath of the LORD of hosts,\nand in the day of his fierce anger.\n\n(Isaiah 13:10-13).\n\n(2 Thessalonians 1:7-9)<---And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ).\n\n(Isaiah 66:15)<---For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.\n\n(Isaiah 29:6)<---Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire.\n\n(Revelation 19:12)<---His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(REPENTANCE is required to be hidden from the Lords anger/JUDGMENT DAY!):\n\nSeek ye the LORD,\nall ye meek of the earth,\nwho have upheld his justice;\n\nseek righteousness,\nseek meekness:\n\nit may be ye\nshall be hid\n\nin the day of the LORD'S anger.\n\n(Zephaniah 2:3).\n\n***(Seek The Lord): This is the language of true (REPENTANCE), renewal, and regeneration.\n\n***(You will be hidden): Zephaniah used a play on words with meaning of his own name, Hidden in the Lord.

Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown). (Matthew 13:30)<---Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers/Angels, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn). (John 14:2-3)<---In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will (((come again))), and (((receive you))) (((unto myself))); that where I am, there ye may be also).\n\nthat shall come to pass,\nand to stand before\nthe Son of man.\n\n(Watch...pray): Jesus encouraged his disciples to be persistent in prayer and faith, looking for the day when the Son of Man exonerates the faithful in the judgment, so that they are able to stand before him.\n\n***(1 John 2:28)<---And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.\n\n***(John 3:2)<---Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.\n\n(Luke 21:34-36).\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n (REPENTANCE):\n\n(Greek.

Love this song

Yummy!!! But I am very anxious for halloween videos
I've never matched apple and blackberry...I can't wait to try it!!
i'm sure this cupcake will taste much more exceptional since there is jemma in it (like literally, since she kinda grated her finger into the grated apple XD)
Honestly I just would like 2 likes that's all:)
Just got back from visiting the UK: I got C+D cupcakes, they were sooo good!

Tasty
Loving this recipe! X
juicy little fillas
Planing to make ur AMAZING Oreo cupcakes
Yum 😋
To all continental Europeans who can't get treacle: I like to use sirop de Liège (boiled down fruit juice, dates, apples and pears I think) or really dark brown muscovado sugar or dates soaked in water and blended up. If someone has another idea, please tell me! \nPs: Golden Syrup is Grafschafter Goldsaft to my fellow Germans :)

I am going to have a go of making the Apple & Blackberry Cupcakes they look lovely .
What about the blackberry goo? You did not use it at the end
These look incredible, and so tasty. I love to bake and this video gave me loads of cool ideas for where flavor can be infused, but theses are so fiddly. This why bakeries like yours exist! Happy to buy these from pros like you, lol.
you looked so sexy when you are baking something
Omg 😍😍😍 I need these in my life
In the southeastern US blackberries are ripe in late June-early July.
I love your shows
Hi jemma im going to visit your shop tomorrow in london. Im soo excited!😍 Gonna buy some cakes
Hi Jemma could please do a video on how to make macron's or if you've already made it please send a link
Hey Jemma, love your vids. I know you love using tea infusions. Please try using Rooibos tea. South African product, it's life changing.
Lovely recipe Jemma. Cannot wait to try it. Looking forward to your video next week!
Thanks so much - now I know what I will bake at christmas for my family. Better start practising :D I I love your videos. Really happy I found you when this channel started. Ist still the best cupcake-channel out there :)
Can I use raisins instead of BlackBerry
You're everything right with YouTube.
I thought treacle and molasses were the same thing?
They look delicious and right up my alley.
I was just craving for some apple crumble!
Does your mixer have light on it?! Oh my goodness..I need that!
Jemma has sacrificed her thumb to the baking gods! This means we will have good bakes for a brief moment until the next sacrifice by someone else!
OMG those are gorgeous and I bet they taste AMAZING. Totally want to make these!!
Looks yummy! Owww on the thumb--I'm always grating my fingertips, so I know how you feel. I have to try putting apple and blackberry together--don't know why it never occurred to me before.
Hello how would you make that recipe in to vegan
Think this one will be as popular in our house as the jammy dodger one, fruit crumble cupcakes winner winner. Thank You Jemma.
Hi Jemma! Thanks for all your videos, they're great inspiration for me. I wanted to ask you whether you could do a basics series. That would be awesome. Thanks again.
These look so yummy! And the potato ricer trick is inspired!
I think that the quality of the video is not as good as before
You know she's a pro because her mixer has a ring light
Poor thumb! \nI feel a little better about slicing my hand with a French mandolin now. Not by much because it hurt like a mother. But a little.
Hi Jemma! I am a huge fan, I recently started a small baking business and you are an inspiration. I am always surprised by your flavor combinations and I have tried dozens of your recipes, they always turn out splendidly! Thank you!
These look yummy! I've never mixed apples and blackberries before so I will definitely give it a go..\nBut I have a question: instead of apple, could I use raspberries or other berries for this recipe or do they have to much water? I'm a little worried that I would squeeze out all the flavour (I hope it makes sense because I'm not that good in English)
Is there an American alternative for golden syrup that isn't corn syrup?
good job need to try someday
hi jemma I like apple and i love your cupcake
I love love love this yesss, so beautiful and I bet it taste AMAZING. never thought about blackberries and apples!
Gemma cupcake do you have any recipe with fresh pomegranate or maybe custard apples please
I'm having a shitty day, Jemma. Hearing your voice and watching you bake brings me joy. Thanks for being you.
What a brilliant idea to use a potato ricer!
I love your top! Where is it from?
these videos get me through the week !! thanks jemma for your baking creativity and expertise ♡☆
JEMMA THIS IS TRENDING IM SHOOK. also this look so so so yum
I won’t lie, a ring light on the arm of a stand mixer seems like the most extra, ridiculous thing I’ve ever seen, that’s probably a huge improvement on user friendliness.
Can someone convert the ingredients for me in US metrics?:)
I love your straight forward approach and quick format!  Keep on baking!
(Silently cursing why I live 1 continent away from C&D).. This looks sooo amazing, I want 1 RIGHT NOW!!
My favourite dessert in cupcake form! 😱 x
Hey Jemma.  How do you stop all the fruit sinking to the bottom
Hey jemma, you didn't state the quantity of flour in your cupcakes in the description box.
I visited your shop on Saturday, and I was so happy to see all the cupcakes! Thanks so much for such a great experience😘
Can't hear Black Treacle without thinking of the Arctic Monkeys. Such a good song. I love apple anything, I'm excited to make these!!
Yes!!! You're back!!!
Gemma!!!! Please make an amazing coffee cupcake!!!! I beg you!!!!!!
IM NEVER THIS EARLY CAN I GET LIKES NOW?!!?😮\n\n\nno.😑\n\n(I'm kidding... this never happens and i need dem likes guys😕)
hi Jemma i just wanna ask if you can also feature on how to make a french macarons..=)
This looks so cute ❤ I love it !
It took me longer than i care to admit, to realise that it wasn't a siren that was going off in every video, it was Jemma opening the oven!
Yum! The compote filling is such a lovely addition.
Do you think this recipe could work with peaches and blueberries?
That’s looking delicious! Will give it a try👍🏻
Did anyone else think the pink buttercream looked like ham?
Jemma I heard recently that you don’t do apple picking in the uk, and I am devastated for you. But.. do you have apple cider donuts? Because that’s the best part of apple picking, the apple cider donuts. \nWhat I’m saying is you should make a video on apple cider donuts. 😊
Why on earth would a person (2 people) dislike this vid?
How could I make this vegan?
I reckon it would be a great cupcake Jemma but too much work for me. I might make the cakes and ice them with a caramel buttercream ( your recipe of course). I love your channel. And your carrot cake is THE BEST.
Omg yummmmm!!! I never would have thought of that combo with the apple and blackberries 😲💯😍👐👏🎉
Hi Jemma, how do you find the Kenwood mixer compared to the Kitchen aid?
All these added sugar is bad for your health please keep that in mind when consuming such creations
Hi , if I don't have a potato riser what can I use or do? Thanks
Hello Jemma. I am big fan of C&D and watching your videos for very long time! Can I ask you, why are you using for making buttercream paddle attachment instead of the whisk attachment? Just curious😉great recipe btw!!!❤❤❤💦

6 out of 6, not too shabby
ROOMIE'S REAL NAME IS JOEL?
I managed to get all of them right!
Yeah this would've been way easier if it weren't shitty midi instruments.\nCrap test.
I got all of them
6/6!
Easy peasy! Got 'em all right :)
4/6
OMG I actually got ALL correct!!!! :D
got em all right
I got um all correct and I'm 12
how am i getting these all right? please help, i'm scared.
Did it feel good though? -IDubbz
oh my fucking god i got all of them right what does it mean???
TIP (for next time): if you number the instruments, and at the and tell the results it becomes easier for us watching to check if we got it right. ;) \nex: 1.cello, 2.piano, 3.trumpet, etc... result (played in this order):  4.clarinete,  5.electric guitar, and so on...
I had those headphones and they were my absolute favorite. Apparently they were my dog's favorite, too. he chowed down on them in no time.
I got that shit right
10 hour loop of Roomie saying Cello with a confused face please.
Wow, Andrew Huang has the same taste in music creators that I do... Neat.
only one person got them all right... it was me xD
I got like 3/6 right
I don't get the challenge, I named them all correctly without much trouble.
I got them right, except for switching round the cello and the trumpet - and I'm not musically trained at all!
I got all of them right, and my hearing is bad, so I'm just smugly satisfied right now
It's cello, not jello
It could be an electric guitar if you took a new born yak and threw it into a vat of nylon
I wasn't really expecting this but I got them all right. I had thought that the piano sample was the nylon guitar until I heard the nylon guitar at the end then switched my answer.
This video could be a nylon string guitar for all I know
I gotta thank my sponsor from the inside of this Unicorn head.\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!!\nI haven't laughed like that at a dumb sight gag in a long time! Thank you Andrew! :)
Actually got them all correct
I got all of them. Perks of being in high school pep band. There are very few.
I got them all right but I don't feel confident that I would have guessed cello without hearing cello guessed. certainly I would have failed if I didn't know what the instrument choices were ahead of time, wow
100%! I'm so proud of myself! Where's my A+, Andrew?
I have people texting me rn but it's really confusing because the text tone is the same note as the samples!!!
I got 5 out of 6
Would have been good if you could have played the entire note at the end to really hear the difference.
If they weren't talking for it, I probably would've got some more of them, they kept making me doubt myself
So I got these all right, but first I had to look up what a nylon guitar was. I figured out it was just a string type of acoustic guitar, other than that the test was fairly easy. \nI don't mean to brag or anything, I am actually confused myself, maybe its because I like to do this sort of thing a lot. A lot of the time its to find the original sounds that were modified to fit an EDM type track, or what a sound from an NES/SNES/N64 is supposed to be mimicking. I mean this is the only logical reason why someone who doesn't know a lot about music would be good at recognising an instrument. (I mean if you asked me to recognise a pitch or note just by hearing it I wouldn't be able to do that.)
it was clear, that rob win this
Woohooo I got them all right! 😁 I paused the video before hearing any other guess so I didn't cheat. 😊
I actually went through this test, and was pleasantly surprised to find that I got all of them correct. The one I had trouble with was the cello because, out of all these instruments, it's the least of heard. I'm proud that I know my tones as well as I do. c:
It could be an electric guitar if... Rob Scallon 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's make this a meme, People!!
Well, I failed miserably. And I play the clarinet. At least the piano is unmistakable.\n1: It's an electric guitar.\n2: Wait, that's an electric guitar. The first was a clarinet.\n3: No, that's an electric guitar. The second was a nylon guitar.\n4: That's a piano. Definitely a piano.\n5: I have nothing...\n6: Wait, that's a nylon guitar. Wait, then what was the second one?
Guessed all of them right!
I want a test WITHOUT an answer sheet.
I play trumpet and literally that blew my mind. 😳
Nailed it. 6 out of 6.
I got them all right. I wouldn't of guessed cello but because all the rest I was confident on the one I didn't know was cello.
I don't get it, this test doesn't seem that hard to me
I got them all right but I work with the middle of sampled instruments all the time.
I got em!! But only because the choices were so limited.
Wow I actually got all of them right
yuh i got all this right on the first time
I got them all correct after I switched which ones I thought were piano/nylon guitar. After I heard the last one I relaized it was the nylon guitar. but 4/6 isn't too bad for the first try...
6/6 and I still can’t write a good song 😐
UGH why do you have boyintheband. Hes so emo he should be in the back of a school room hiding his ugly face. But yourblucky you have the impressionist and you, i liked.
I got all of them right! I thought the piano was nylon guitar at first, but when I heard the last one I figured since you let Roomie change his answer, I could too. So I guess I got 5/6 right if I weren't allowed to switch, but I'm still proud :D
I got them all right
It would be an electric guitar if... that'd be a funny meme. Get on it people who are more talented than I.
i had this idea a few weeks ago lol
Not that anyone cares, but I got 100%
I got it all right! (Id hope so since I’m doing music at uni)
I got the cello one wrong
I got them all right!
I got them all right!
I got them all right!
The only ones I could make out perfectly were the cello and piano because I play the two.
It could be an electric guitar.... If it was tuned to drop C
Got them all right but definitely wouldn't have if I didn't know what instruments there were...

There midi samples but I love this challenge I would like to try it with the natural instruments. it was like two challenges in one for me .thanks  I enjoyed it
got them all right! but I reckon that’s luck rather than skill
I have not went to any musical school and I still got everything right
I’m so surprised that I got all of these.
I got them all right! :3 it's easy if you use midi samples often
Roomie saying Cello made me laugh so hard
They all sound like Otomatones!
I got 100%
Clarinet✔\nTrumpet❌\nElectric guitar❌\nCello ❌\nNylon Guitar❌\nPiano✔
4/6
i got 5
they made this awesome vid together --------------> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQe9w6awkU8&t=0s
please start vlogging
6/6 boys
*whispers* cello...
Got all 6 right, yay
Cello 5 \nPiano 4\nTrumpet 6\nClarinet       1\nElectric guitar 3 \nNylon guitar 2
Hey 100 percent
Got all right
ez
Use a speech jammer app!
4 out of 6, missed 2+5
100%!
Well....that test was weird-ly easy.
I got 6/6 😎
TREENDSSIINGNNGNG
I got all right thankfully
Hey Andrew
This video would be an electric guitar if we remove the guitar from it and replace it with youtube

I would love to know which places you've been to outside of California and if you can include the year that you went, that would be great 😊. You have such an interesting life.

You're probably the most gorgeous human being I've ever seen. Where have you been all my YouTube life 😞😞😞
Lovvveeee this such a cleaver idea.....I'm doing a give away on my channel if anyone wants to look 💋
Can someone do a compilation of Jamie going 'wee' because her 'wee's make me so happy and I dunno why
This actually looks like something I could do 😂🙌🏻
satan the devil will be glad that you are impersonating the dead
the teeth are so bomb!!! and they don't actually look tooooo hard to do!
No matter how many videos i watch I never get tired of Her accent. And she's just awesome and so talented
Your face lost 10 pounds with that contour
Not the type of drugstore I meant
WHAT A BRILLIANT FUCKING CONCEPT OMG THIS IS AMAZING
You make it look so easy 😍
Love this ur such a talented makeup artist I just love ur videos Jamie n ur such a beautifull person inside n out ;) xxx
Rimmel London has SO many cool products out, just not available to us in the US. I wanna try so many things, the main one being the Contour Stick! I seriously have been thinking about saying fuck it & ordering it from Amazon bc I honestly don't think it will EVER be available in the US!
‘ just because we’re dead doesn’t mean we can’t highlight ‘ 😂😭💅
Just cause we dead doesn't mean we can't highlight 😂☠
seriously you make black shadow contour look good. \nalso. i live for the weeeeeeeeee when you zoom in. \nperf.
Such a good make up artist love all your looks!
Hey Jamie!! Just bought some Zoeva brushes and I would love for you to make a video of how you clean your brushes. I don't want to ruin mine so it would be great if you show us how you do it!! :*
You are just the cutest!!! loved the looks
Loved his video! Defo scary but glam at the same time
You're accent is fucking E V E R Y T H I N G. UGGGH MAWMA 😍😍
honestly when i die the highlighting trend is going to be something that people look back and cringe at (lookin at you overplucked brows) but im gonna demand in my will that they highlight me to the gods bc just because we dead doesnt mean we cant highlight
Celebrate death. Dumb people buy products to help the zionists
Love it!  Love everything about it!! 💀☠️💀☠️💀☠️
Thank you so much for simplifying this and making it actually seem doable! 😊
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT EVEN I CAN PULL OFF THE 'MAKEUP SKILL-ADVANCED' SKULL????? Why in the hell does every other tutorial make it look like it requires 33 full hours and half a dozen hands to accomplish exactly what you just did? Thank you for the simpler tutorial!!!!!! \nP.s. I don't plan on letting death stop me from highlighting either.😂😂😂😂💥💥💥
Such a cool look
Simple but absolutely incredible!! I'm doing this for Halloween!! loooooove!!!
This was amazing!!!! So good! You should do an actual day to night makeup look. Like how you'd fix up your foundation/concealer and everything too! That would be great to see!
You're gorgeous and have stunning eyes! Quite frankly, you make me sick! Lol! Kidding. You really are very beautiful, though. :)
Keep doing what you are doing!  Love it! Mmm....
The most beautiful spooky ghoul in all the land 😍😍

“just because we’re dead doesn’t mean we can’t highlight” - Queen Jamie 👏👏👏
I feel like this Halloween look has zero effort into it . Jamie always shows up and PERFORMS! and this Halloween skull isn’t even worth it :(

Omg yes 😍😍😍
This is trending! Woohoo!! Go Jamie!
Fookin badarse (in your accent of course) 😂😂 so talented!!! Love everything!!! And you too of course as well!!!
How to make your fat face look slim
Basic. Everyone has done this already. Next.
Do they get mad when you call their products the wrong thing?
I only just noticed how pretty your eye colour is 😍
Love it, but nose contour looks kinda weird. Prob look better blended slightly down more
I think u will get more subs if u talk less and make for talk throughs and speed up the video when u edit.😁
Weekend Woman debuted at #12 on the New Alternative 40 Chart this week:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGuUAtJ8yMM&index=12&list=PLxlSBzMcrtkMCVtuXEIz5BXpPfycTwsS5
This song gets better with every listen. Can't get enough of it.
I stopped listening since after Maladroit... I think I might listen again :)
Judging by that bridge, this is the song that should have been called Beach Boys.
Sounds like a generic Gin Blossoms song from the mid 90's
Oh God this is my favorite off the album so far!!
This song is more Beach Boys than Beach Boys
where's my hash pipe?
really love the new songs
Oh wow burning sun done over. Good song. This album has a nice rhythmic sound.
Much, much better than the previous 3 singles. Still scared for this album.
Wonderful verse, weak chorus and OK bridge.  6/10   I'd rather listen to the Green demo than this unfortunately.
This has a modern yet classic 60s pop sound. Between this and Weezer's recent use of the 50s chord progression in Go Away and Endless Bummer, they are bringing back great things. This really reminds me of Weezer combined with The Monkees new song She Makes Me Laugh (written by Rivers, of course.) Buying the new album at release.
Weezer is probably my favorite active band. I've really liked the past 2 albums and the first 2 releases from the new album are good just not as good as most of their past work. This song however sucks.
Best single they've released for the new album by far
this is actually good
Really good. I'm enjoying the change, especially from the White album.
Must be a big album
Not a bad track... the more I think about one of my top 10 Weezer tracks, “Eulogy for a Rock Band,” the more I think it’s about them and leaving rock music behind 😢
The bridge gives me chills =w=
Melody sounds like it was lifted from an earlier B-side called Burning Sun.
I'm a Weezer fan..went on first Weezer cruise..this song is pretty lame..most of the recent releases have been lyrically pretty crappy..almost like Rivers lost his edge for writing good pop singles. The alliteration is great.
what a good song
he sounds like the dude that sang rude
Genius
still stucky in my head
Not 1 single mention of Mary Tyler Moore. Disappointed
sorry, but in my opinion this is not good...
I swear, when I first saw the title, I thought it was showing Wonder Woman, anyways, great song!
This is a really good song!
This video made me fart.
This is the only song I like off Pacific Daydream but still lower the Pop taste just a but please.
thought I was looking at the ocean man album cover from a distance
Best single so far.
is weezer going to hit the trifecta of 3 good albums in a row...\nman i dunno if i'm ready for this
The melody/harmonies and the arrangements are just beautiful <3
These new songs aren't bad. Not my jam though. This one is actually really good compared to the others though.
Use more vocal melodies and songs Rivers wrote from the 90s and we'll talk.
Best single from this album so far imo
For me this makes 4 great summer jams on this album so far. Very happy with how this is turning out.
Nice one!  \nSpecialy when this began: I still believe your beautiful lies
yes, if you're trying to figure out that youtube is an algorithm based on previous video views and snapshots of thumbnails, yes, it is true.
I feel like nobody brings up how creative these lyric videos are!
Much better than burning sun imo, this takes everything good from burning sun and enhances it, burning sun has the same problem that all Green songs have (i critique green for being solid but extremely safe and the songs follow a generic and identical formula)
Best song you guys have released so far! Love it!
dig the song! here's a brief write-up I did about it https://zumic.com/weekend-woman-weezer-youtube-audio-single
Finally, a good song. This is what I was hoping the whole album will be like. Here's hoping that everything we haven't heard so far is like this too.
My new second favorite song first is only in dreams
This might be the second album I have ever gotten
Amazing to think that Rivers has been holding onto a melody this good for so long, unable to finish it until now. And now we've ended up with one of the absolute best modern Weezer tracks, with new lyrics and an incredible arrangement. I'm glad it's finally finished and out there, because this song is excellent.
Finally we got a good one
I miss Weezer so much. Will they ever come back, or is fluffy beach stuff all they're going to churn out now?
*My personal rankings so far*\n1. Feels Like Summer\n2. Mexican Fender\n3. Weekend Woman\n4. Beach Boys
O c t o b e r 2 7 t h
THIS SONG IS SO GOOD
New Weezer, Liam and Noel Gallagher album! What a time to be aline 💕
Sounds very 80s prom to me lol
Oh yes this is amazing
Argentina is still waiting for Weezer!! =w=
I love it! <3
2 3 la rola
los amo, hijosdeputa!
stop
meh
Always late
weezer manda mtoooo!!!!
Is gud
Thats a tune!
The Shins sound great!
Burning Sun from Green Era almost exaclty.
4.07 minutes of happiness
Burning sun anyone?? B sides little bitches.
love weezer always
Booo make weezer suck again!
no
Damn.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Good job, Weezer!
Good
Reminds me of Hot Dad
<3
This is Burning Sun remade, cool
Burning SUN!!!!!
Awesome.
When did Weezer become another lifeless pop act?
Even the B sides off the white album are better than this. Missing the rock sound.
At least he doesn't do that awful rap-singing thing in this song
1 for 4 is acceptable enough in baseball I guess
Why do I keep checking if weezer has found that good sound again from the 90s/first two albums? I need to let go.
Sigh. More overproduced pop rock from a beloved band with which I grew up. What happened? No band will always remain the same, but WHAT IS THIS?!? Where is the authenticity of Pinkerton? Where are the harder riffs?
Wish there was just more fuzzy guitars and less church bells and reverb. 🙄
Huge Weezer fan, definitely not a fan of this one though. Beat and melodies are okay, but the lyrics make me wanna gag.
This is a great Weez tune. Has a White vibe and Green vibe. Ranking high on my Weezer overplay list. The previous 3 were flimsy. This one's strong. 
Good
SOUNDS LIKE BURNING SUN!
More and more bullshit. Just retired already Weezer, you haven't had a decent album in 11 years!
Weezer is one of the best bands ever, with some of the worst fans ever.  So negative, always picking apart every note of every song, forever comparing everything they do to Blue or Pinkerton.  Where's the loyalty?  Where's the love?  Honestly, the worst Weezer song is better than nearly every song that gets played on the radio.  Stop complaining and give Weezer the credit they deserve.
Meh
is the Black Album, Pacific Daydream? Or is this just a separate Album?
ecuador: empezar las eliminatorias con todo para valer verga las ultimas fechas.
7:22 Está bien,  está muy  bien ¿Y saben porqué está bien? porque Ecuador no reventó la pelota, quisieron salir jugando, cuando se dieron cuenta Chile ya había adelantado a todo el batallón 😂😂😂
Chile is a better team for Russia than Argentina
Valio Verga Ecuador 😢😢
VALDIVIA CRACK!!!
Brasil💛💙♡
Come on Valencia!!! You are definitely better than this!!! 😓😓😓
why you upload it in slow motion ?
what a horrible fault by the defender
Bien  Chile le ganamos a la Seleccion del Congo...perdon..Camerun..hoops Nigetia...sorry...Zaire...lo sinto..Haiti...de nuevo...et, etc....    lol
Чили силно санчс видал

Pobre puto chileno me cago en la madre puto..

chupame la pijosky rusosky
Vamos Ecuador, cuantas beces no los han tratado injustamente los Arbitros cuando juegan encontra de Argentina?!!!!    Cuantas veces no kes han llamado monos los Argensimios?! \nTalvez no vayan al Mundial pero todo el Mundo recordara el Dia en que ECUADOR dejo afuera del mundial al Niño Mimado por la FIFA MESSI.  Hagan historia y ganen a Argentina
Ecuador era un muerto en etapa terminal  asI de simple.
Nepal is the best
Bien hecho Chile la estan sufriendo al igual que nosotros. Espero que nos podamos ver en Rusia. Un saludo desde Arequipa.
que goles mas tontos se hicieron los ecuatorianos con errores de principiantes
La mejor eliminatoria del mundo, en Europa hay mucho equipo flácido todavía
Ecuador , ecuador ....    solo haces noticias por el gobierno..\nComo equipo  desaprovechastes  tus tiempos ... lamentablemente estas son las consecuencias!!
Chile sube el camino
What the hell was that player doing after he missed that open header ?! 4:32
Clarito se ve como el defensa espera a que Vidal se la robe....
Whats gunna happen to Ecuador?
congrats Chile \nChile football lover
Brasil 6 chile 0
Toño Valencia vales ctm !!! Por tu culpa vino el primer gol lamparoso hdp !!!!

My god ? Still left to see
Weird to me, but if it makes him happy then go for  it. Only thing I have to question is the pets, Babies can't own pets 😂
Well, some men live their lives as women and viceversa....so
I hate seeing all the hate comments. Like who cares if he acts like a baby. He’s not hurting you. So shut up. If it makes him happy let him do it.
Fuck I would love to beat the shit out of him make him a man .....
Man,  I was abused at the age of 5-7  and feel like my childhood went to a limbo and life made me grow up a bit quicker, but this just makes dealing with things even worse.  It is like sticking to the past inside your mind-- it affects your present and you are not able to live your present thus you get more behind in your life.  Life is what you make of it.
random comment but the lady seems really fun and nice! \nher laugh is really cute >w<
This guy is a joke
I think he’s cute when he has the passifier it’s kinda cute
nigga it’s 2:32 AM tf am I watching
This only happens in American. Americans are messed up
How did I get from crying over a breakup to this
I am 12 and I want to be a baby 🍼 again cuz my mom never played with me only my siblings and I am the oldest but I feel bad for what the man wanted as a baby but he didn't get cuz probably the mother didn't care nor loved him 😭👶🏻
He looks like a fat Donald Jr. Trump.
I agree with the cat
the most exciting thing when you grow up is to explore more in life .. He grew up indeed but he never grew wanting to act like an adult..im afraid that perhaps one day he'll experience some regrets of not being on his adult age...
he look like muscle man he's like my mom
So he's a little?
Kind of upsetting how much negativity is under this video considering i thought we were in an era of time that was more understanding lol
It would suck if you have to be stuck with him during a zombie apocalypse
wait is this what happen to mark delfigilo from zoey 101
I thought this was a porno when the lady came out
wh do these people always look how you would expect them to
Lmao this is not an obsession, stop trying to make these problems seem 'normal' and acceptable in society. These are just mental illnesses that seem to be being pushed forwards towards society to make it acceptable, gays are a perfect example of what I'm tryna say.
These people don't deserve to be in this world.  Holy fuck.
This is weird. Bro is big as hell wearing baby diapers and eating bland ass baby food. How does he support himself? Or is this considered a mental issue?
I had this but not as severe, I would watch baby tv shows late at night to fall asleep and keep stuffed animals near me , it was a way of coping with my depression
He should test baby food for a living and tbh he did a great job with that high chair, hed probably make a lot of money if he sold those and cribs.
This is why u shouldent spoil kids\n\n\n\n\nThey turn out like him
But low key I'd pipe
He has his own house, made his own chair. I don't see anything wrong with this if he's not affecting anyone.
Why is he so thiccc😂😑
Y'all should have seen my face the entire time I was watching this
I feel bad for him
It was weird, but then that chick came in and... ugh.
Atleast he knows how to make things
Not to be rude but he a chubby baby
The woman is actually kinda hot. I'm a baby too
I feel this guy just needs help
This shit has to be fake
But honestly SAME. I can just avoid about every responsibility
Then a pornstar walks in 4:56
He looks like he has murdered a couple people
I wonder if the mommy gets paid a lot ??
Does he actually work
It’s a little weird but what else should I expect this video is titled adult baby
When you see a creepy guy at the grocery story who you think has kids trapped in his basement. Surprise he’s the baby.
I understand this, it's something he never had as a child
What did I just watch!?
this is so about sex so wired
So he's been doing this since he was 13! Why didn't his parents get him help?!
Damnnn i wanna play with her
How much does the Mother get paid tho?
Eugene from the walking dead
_what. The. Actual. Fuck._
He is not hurting anyone but I still think it is creepy D:
ok this is weird as fuck but I respect him but still
I mean.. I’ve seen worse. it’s kinda awesome though.
When your ran out of ways on how to pick up girls
I want to be him when I’m older!❤️❤️
When you forgot to live your childhood
JESUS CHRIST😭😭 that girl and him seem liked they fucked before that shit wayyyyyy to kinky
Fuck everything I'mma become a baby again. Over this adult shit, where's my bottle.
In other words, the typical Liberal SJW.
I like how these British shows are trying to focus on American people so they can ignore how shitty their society is
This is Abdl, a kink, disturbing, not to ick anybody's yum but yeah. Just to make it clear this is different from ddlg and ageplay isn't always included in ddlg. I identify as a little/middle, ageplay creeps me out so I just don't. I like dressing in a style that's a mixture of cutesy and sexy. It's more of a personality thing, rather than making myself feel like a toddler or child. I'm more of a sub than anything else
How did I get on the ‘weird’ side of YouTube?
At least we got more pussy
This is some crazy white people shit
Yeah tuck my fat ass in the crib bitch
WHAT.THE.FUCK. I guess this is what happens when you hit rock bottom. At least he's potty trained. Jesus Holy Fuck is wrong with this fat ass butterball. He probably hoping he can suck suck some tittie when he get hungry cause he knows he ain't getting any on his own. Peace out Bitches. I'm out for now.
poor cat\n\n - via YTPak(.com)

U should put poppy in every vlog xx
the way you edited the aquariam part made me feel like a mermaid
The Aquarium looked like a date 😉😆. Poppy is hot! Best wishes gabs x (im probs misreading shit but ah well)
I really hope this doesn't come across as patronising because I really don't mean it to but can I just say how fucking amazing it is to see you out the flat so much recently and especially getting out to see friends. As someone who suffers from anxiety and depression I know how hard it is to even leave the house, I struggle to even take my daughter to nursery most days without feeling sick at the thought. I'm proud of you for even your little trips to the beach to read or sit and think. Hope your doing well babes, you really seem to be getting there with things and I know it doesn't mean you are but I hope you are. Love you loads xxxx
Omg one time I literally pushed my laptop off the table because there was a spider on the screen
I feel like there is sexual tension between poppy and gabbs ahaha

Remember Steam users, please!
I love how this is trending with only 80k views.
Is this an actual game or just a fun little animation?
I hear Spielberg is in talks to direct the 3rd season opener. Really hope he does it. Would be a [literal] return to his 80s roots.
*I have to play this, thank you for the video because this is the first time I have heard of it*
Where can I find the 13th heart?
Interesting:)
Less than 300 likes and 27 comments but it’s on trending?!?!??! \nOk YouTube
See the gameplay of this in\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Z4sjJJnFjy4
Looks great! But please...pretty please. Bring it to the Nintendo Switch?
This is an app for android and iOS.\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bonusxp.legend
I need this to happen
To everyone asking, the game is an app, available on iOS and Android.
Is this gonna be a real game?
I need this in my life.
Its hard to search for it in the play store. I downloaded it after clicking links that directed me to it in the store. Uninstalled it because im werry of its access.
LOL this trailer just spoiled me a lot, I just started watching
If they make a stranger things game, I don’t want it to follow the shows plot. I’d want it to be a completely original story.\n\nedit:unless this already is an original story
Lol wat I have more subs than this company:0
this looks just like Zelda!
I almost blew up my hand playing with dry ice.
Here before this blows up, it's only a matter of time. This looks awesome, but please, please, PLEASE don't make a bad game adaptation! We all want to see a good quality game and not something rushed and thrown together just to earn some quick money.
Omg want.\nDoesn't it come out Halloween?
I wish they'd do a Stranger Things TellTale game instead
I want a stranger things game similar to Friday the 13
where can I find it and bring it to the Nintendo switch
YES
what's the name of the game called
Please be real.
Hi
Who else hit start.😁?
What a game!!👍
Here before this blows up.
I'm here before this blows up. I made an it parody check it out ❤️
Pokemon+Undertale+Stephen King:W O N D E R F U L  (Please,bring it on steam)

I CANT FIND DUSTIN IM CRYING
is this a joke or is it real?
This deserves no dislikes, omg so much nostalgia 🤗
This could be a good show. But where's OA Season 2????????????
Now this is how you fucking make a trailer
The first german series on netflix. Lets see ....
This looks epic; is it in English tho?
Hey Netflix.  Have you heard of an indie game called Inside by Playdead?  If you haven't, you should go check it out, and make a series off of that.
An article called it 'noir', i'm in!
Now this is interesting! I love mystery kind of movies/show so yeah
Ok 1953, 1986 and 2019 - there's a pattern here, a 33 year gap between these dates. This definitely means something, maybe these timelines are running parallel to each other?
I'VE BEEN WAITING A YEAR SINCE THE FIRST TRSILER I'M SO EXICTED
looks kinda mad
Like it If you are also watching this video in 2036.
As a person who loves shows like Stranger Things, I still don't see the resemblance and it feels more like IT (and just a tiny bit of Riverdale) to me to be honest...
So kids go missing\nWith Netflix that means only one thing,\nThey're trapped in the Upside Down!
Nope, too late at night for this, Netflix. I'll come back in 10 hours.
I pressed like before I even watched the video
fun for all the family.
So, is this produced in English or will this be subtitled?
Its giving me black mirror and the returned kind of vibes don’t know why though
Can't wait to watch both Dark and Bright on Netflix!
Okay you have my attention.
It looks like Saw 😱
Yeah my birth day........... does that say something
sold. I'll have to read this with subtitles
Anything with time travel, I'm in.
Netflix has a lot of horror films coming out this month and I'm excited for all of them
Okay, you have my attention.
What If Doc Brown was a Weeping Angel?\nSOLD!
Now this looks interesting.
Could be the next stranger things or it could be shit I'm gonna give it a chance
I've been waiting for this for quite sometime now
The question is is math related to science
something that stephen king would write
I will give chance,looks good
This reminds me of a book I've read Black River by T.J. MacGregor which the antagonist kidnaps children from different timelines.
That looks like some good shit right there. Good shit. Right there right there If I do say so myself and I say so
OK, guys, before the movie is released on Dec. 1, guess the answer to the question: When?
When has kidnapped the children?
I'm pretty sure the question of who kidnapped the kids is gonna come up a few times, and be important to the plot.
Love the use of typography!
I wish this was just a trailer for an episode of new season of black mirror
damn son. please find some nasty asian movie, those are hardcore too.
Yo. Netflix gets a standing O from me. They are killing the movie market.
This is what tpicals film
FNGHD DGTD BD
Es geschah am hellichten Tag, ich bin mal gespannt. (I'm curious.)
This looks interesting
interestinggggggg
Fucking Pennywise.
Dammit! Another Adam Sandler movie...🤔
Netflix is straight ass
This is fucking good damnnn
You got my attention!
Um, what?
This looks sick!
Stranger Things + time travel
se ve genial aaaa
Can't wait !!!!
December 1
Fuck yes
Gosh darnit Netflix I can't take your awesomeness any more!
FUCK YES
Wunderbar!
JOLLY TIMES
yesss! I've been waiting!!!
ZZZZZZZZ
German Broadchurch? Yes please.
Looks promising
I'm in.
Jigsaw reborn...😁😁😁
Oeh Nice
twin peaks vibes
Uumm, yea...
Mixture of The OA and Stranger Things
This looks happy and delightful
seems good
Woah this looks visually stunning!
I am ready!!!
Getting Twin Peaks vibes from this.
Looks Finchery im game!
Stranger things + It
Can people not compare every supernatural show to Stranger Things. It was alright but definitely overrated
Movie or series?
Is this going to be in English?
Netflix is now basically 100% series about homosexuality and homosexuals. And in EVERY Netflix series there are scenes which can be enjoyed only by gays, and are extremely disgusting for everybody else! I cancelled my subscription long time ago.
Netflix I have an idea for a great show it could bring you more subscribers but nothing is free so wassup
So... Stranger Things with time travel stuff?
Are they implying a ginger gone missing is a bad thing?? 🤔😬🤐
When you really want to empathize that you're show is DARK
Really? First, a move called Bright. Now, we have Dark. Can they film Dim?
The question is not donde esta la biblioteca...
Netflix movies usually look the same for me. I hope they stop making such movies or use a different editor at least.
Song??
is this a german production?
Stranger Things 1.1
stränger zings or ït
Anybody know the song at 0:34?
I don't get it..
congratulations Netflix on another piece of shit
Netflix, why you're doing this to me? Too many great shows, i can't keep up , my older cousins can't stop talking how their 90's childhood were better compare to mine , Niggas please,  you didn't have netflix back then
Wow Stranger Things season 2 looks great!
US/México or Brazil
American 👌
I like American 😁
you're beautiful!
يمة شهالبنية الحلوة!! I mean such a beautiful girl
youre so perfect!! omggg i wish i could be youu
definitely prefer the french side wowowoow
You are gorgeous!!!!!!!!!!!
French side
FRENCH SIDE THOOOO 😍😍😍
Aré u wearing lenses?
What lenses r u wearing?
Love your vs videos!!
Excellent video!
J’adore!
Loved this! 😍🔥💞
You're so gorgeous! 😍😍❤
French!!
I love how she used YSL for the american side LOL
I love the French side
I’m so excited for the upcoming videos on this series because this is so much fun to watch and it’s funny cuz I didn’t know I was doing legit French makeup everyday and even glam haha!!
Guys does anyone know where her contact lenses are from?
I love the French side 😍😍😍
I love the French side
Love the French side.
Is she French? Cause I heard Dominique is a French name
I love the French style😍😍...even if I don't wear makeup at all
Make a video how to make makeup a Greek and a American ❤❤❤ I love you 👑👑👑💎💎💎
I thought I did my makeup the Korean way -- watching this made me realize that it's more like French. Haha! (With a nude lip tho, I don't wear red lipstick XD) Subbed!
I love the French side.
I actually like the french side a whole lot 😊❤️
Hi Christen! I am French and I can tell you did it right ah ah ! Also, most of us don't do bold lip. We rather insist on eyes indeed, but we usually finish the look with a nude gloss on the lips 😀
I loveeeee LOVE the French. ❤️👌🏾
When you realize your entire makeup routine is the French side
Do a American makeup VS Arabic (UAE Dubai )makeup
What music is in your video?
I really enjoyed this video, but I just want to put that reminder out there that these makeup trends are really only used for Instagram makeup or YouTube. Rarely does anyone do full glam on a daily basis, even in America. Walk into an American school or an American store and you will see the vast majority - if not all - wearing the right side.
I love when you do these kinds of videos. It's really interesting to learn about the different visions of beauty in other countries
I love the French side. Less dark eyeshadow
What lenses are you wearing?
You’re so pretty ❤️ and I just realized I’ve been doing French styled make up my whole life without meaning to😅
The american side is ridiculous.
You're adorable! I'm following you now!
Wow, I think I prefer the French side on you! Your face and eyes on that side just look more lifted and youthful, plus your skin looks more glowy and bright. Great video :)
Its so refreshing to see a youtuber who seems to have done some research and isn't screaming and ranting and raving.
My inner french is crying.\nThe french side is tottally my go to make up style !
THANK YOU for doing something different! I think I've seen every makeup tutorial on youtube under the sun and have never come across this. Very creative, well done xx
American eyes . French eyebrows . French face skin . American lips . 😍😍😍😍😍
I pick french because it's more natrual❤
Love the French side. French women seem to have an effortless beauty. Love it ❤️
American for night, French for Day
You're so pretty!
What contacts are you wearing??
I like the French ❤️ it's very nice and natural and it beautiful and classy. The American is like a HUGE overdose and I feel like it's covering up YOU. Like ur covering everything up tbh😑 Loved this video tho! It was very interesting 😉😊
I’m conflicted I’m American and I love natural makeup and so does everyone around me idk I don’t usually come across people that do bold makeup on a day to day bases I usually makeup done like that in maybeline L’Oréal commercials
Dang... the French side <3 <3 is sooo beautiful and only watched this video just to see that side, to be honest.  I'm American and have had a bit of a French style.  They totally understand their natural, beautiful selves.  Ugh.  Sooo pretty!  Less is DEFINITELY more <3. Very beautifully done.
Lol been do the French look my whole life then
I know I'm part French, but gee. I've been doing the french style for a few years now and I didn't know it. I just love the natural glow look. That and the american style would swallow my eyelids whole. I definitely prefer the French side, oddly enough, your face looks more slimmer and youthful with that style of makeup.
Where are your colored contacts from?
i'm american and i only wear makeup like 25% of the time, but when i do, i'm going to go all out and go for the bold eyes.
I am American and prefer the soft, more natural look.
I really love these kind of videos. Can you please do a American vs Arab makeup please
Can u do a goddess makeup tutorial
Its like Korean 😂😂😂😂 no
love them both, especially the French side. Beautiful ladies!
After this video, i will change my style of makeup into French makeup style. OMG it looks stunning and classy
Both are beautiful- preferred the Americans side. Love the glam. I always go natural
In love with the French side 😝
Just gained a new subscriber❤
You nailed the French side!!  I used to live there and the women LOVE red lips with super neutral eyes. Btw this is my first time viewing your channel and I love you ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I've actually worn the French look daily and to work for years! Have tested out all kinds of looks on myself and this one is 💯 for me
I love how the French side makes the eyes look brighter instead of darker!
Obsessed with French culture. It looks so beautiful.
I like the French one
hi I wanna say u very pwetty 😍👏🏽😩❤️
I like the French side much more but I like the lip on the American side. For some reason I'm not the biggest fan of red lipstick. It looks great on you & many others but I guess I just don't love a bold lip like everyone else does. Call me weird. I don't like highlight either 😂 I know everyone is supposed to love highlighters but I just... don't
What is the brand and color of your contacts pleaseeee
what's the name of the song?
i like the french more
Love the French makeup. Very pretty
She did her research! Greetings from EU
also, good to know I naturally do my makeup in the French way. I don't have time to do liner and a full on eye look every day, I barely use dark eyeshadows anyway
cultural makeup standards died the minute internet beauty gurus kicked in. all of the old standards merged into one trend. we’re literally one big community all united in the same direction. like I’m Arabian girl and I never did an egyptian eyeliner with double wing and an intense smokey eye. nonetheless I loved the makeup looks you came up with, very aesthetically pleasing 💘
I love both sides!!! They are so different yet they are both beautiful. I’m from Peru where make up is really popular yet the everyday look is more like the french side. Literally my everyday look is like the french side. I don’t even use foundation or concealer. I just fill in my eyebrows, curl my lashes, mascara, little bit of natural bronzer and lipstick. But that doesn’t mean we don’t appreciate the american make up. I actually love it and it’s really popular for events and such.
Lmao I SWEAR sometimes I'd love to see girls of my country wearing this fresh and classy look that you made, but most of the time they have this big blue eyeshadow, this fucking orange/brow bronzer and this fucking pink gloss.. God help France pls
I like the American makeup it seems so beautiful but is not a makeup that I would use everyday I’ll put the America’s makeup in like an event and the French I liked because it seems natural that makeup I’ll putted to go out
I don't really wear make up at all. Only wear make up when I go out on a night out. Which is rare so when I do I just keep in simple and natural.
You just look.... like American.... to me... no difference haha lol😂 Because of your eyebrows and how you did the lips
sorry to disappoint you but i'm french and there is very few woman who put on make-up like that. anyway your make up amazing !!!!
My favorite series any youtuber has ever come up with!!
can you fill your bald spot that is on your hairline please
The french side is literally my every day makeup routine, just without the eyeshadow cause I never have time.. And I'm Bulgarian 😂 And yes the skin care is important.  But I like me an extra night out American style makeup from time to time, it's a healthy balance.
Love the French side so much!
had no idea my style is french... mascara and red lips 😁
The fact that I just read Italian instead of American shows that I need to sleep instead of watching Youtube videos
I love the American side a lot more and the French side it's nice but I like them or go inside the most
One of the strangest conspiracies about these American looks is I literally have not seen anyone in real life wear these bold looks that didn't work in a makeup store. At work, most of the ladies don't wear makeup.
Anyone wants to be YouTube friends? Sub 4 a sub 😀
DO A FRENCH VS KOREAN MAKEUP NEXT PLEASE
The French do this and The French don't do that. Get over yourself. You don't even know 4 French people, personally and yet you think you're the authority on us French people's makeup or beauty routine? FOH, s'il te plaît.
I would love him to be my teacher
Nice tie daddy
I wish I had him as a science teacher in school.
I deeply admire this man's restraint.\n\nYou can just see how rattled he is by the sheer stupidity of some Twitter users. There's undoubtedly a part of him that desperately wants to rip these losers a new one.\n\nBut he's resolutely committed to his role as an educator. If Laozi lived today, the Daodejing would have a story about Neil DeGrasse Tyson.
*IS MATH RELATED TO SCIENCE!?!*
but is math related to science
I don’t think that’s what the last one was asking...?
Why did noboby ask is math related to science
Did y’all see the way the planet flew out of his hand!!! What the fuck!! That’s some magic shit. The ball defied gravity
I can’t be the only one who thought of EXO at 4:54 right? Haha
I think we just fight wars based on political ideology now
Is Math Related to Science?
i think she meant peace as in bye
Is math related to science?
Neil is ACTUALLY the most interesting man in the world
looooool 0:56 he lets himself have like half a laugh then BAM SERIOUS ANSWER TIME.
6:31 turn that into a meme and call it Retro Neil Approves
How many science in math?
*He has to dumb everything down for Americans! In Europe we learn these things as kids.*  😂😂😂😂
While some of the questions are just durrrrr hearing Mr. Tyson explain something makes me feel smarter.
Might be a little irrelevant, but that tie looks really cool. I want it...
I want that tie
Just because you can't see it, touch it or smell it, doesn't mean it doesn't exist. I can already see all the creationists quote mining this and thinking it proves God's existence.
Why Lady Gaga is famous and people like Neil isn't?
I see my man Neil flexin with that fresh ass Gucci x Space tie 😤😤😤😤
I love how Newtons laws don't actually work on a bigger scale and then theory relativity comes in to place and that is replaced by quantum mechanics. Its like we get a level up each time we discover something and then have to relearn everything
3:15 that is the argument for god lol.
Isn't there a beauty quark too? Or am I thinking a meson or something like that? Also quantum mechanics doesn't explain gravity. Does it?
Where does I say that math is related to science
If energy cannot be created or destroyed, than how does the universe keep expanding infinitely, and what came before the Big Bang?
What if the universe is not expanding, but everything is getting smaller and that way it makes it look like it is expanding to us?
I never heard Tyson say “I don’t know.” I’m shook
BUT! is math related to science?
We live in a holographic reality / universe. Hidden Power University unlocks the mysteries of the cosmos, awakening the masses while confirming the findings of Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson as correct...  -Adisa Ra
What does he mean you can't smell them? My life reeks of nucleons
I love Dr. Tyson. I wish I knew that he was answering questions because I'd like him to give thought to the idea that our universe operates on rules similar to computer programs.
Neil's tie is fire
Smooth operator. I think Neil has gotten as successful as he has based on his skill, calmness and confidence in his words.
jordan sounds like a fucking genius.
we can smell taste see protons because they are the fundamental particles
A real life know it all:V

I have one for you Neil: Is math related to science?
I love this dude. He's the best
is math related to science?
Who the fuck was in charge of the zoom for the camera, good god it change every time  he finished a sentence
You need to make “real” tech support, like invite Linus Sebastian or barry allen from the channel bulletbarry , where they answer questions about tech :)
I need Neil's Space Tie
Thanks Neil. But why does the camera keep zooming in and out? Making my head hurt
That's a nice tie... and a beautiful face
is katy perry related to human race
But... is math related to science?
I need that tie.
same with Jesus you don't need to see his hear him feel him to know he exists iven tho he does show his blessings on people that need it
Who decided to put that much compression on Niel's beautiful voice
Is math related to science?
Hahahahaha I love this man
I wonder if the varying distance of the moon impacts earthquakes and such.  That would make more sense to me.  Like if there were more phenomenon when the moon is closer to us.
If lights the fastest thing in the universe than how come the darkness is always there first?
His mannerisms remind me of my grandpa (if my grandpa wasn't a young earth creationist)
A tie full of stars
People say the universe don't be like it is, but it do. - black science guy
Reply to my question, NEIL!!!
i love this man...
I want Neil to read me Good Night Moon
You can tell Neil gets pissed off at people who ask dumb questions
I´ll be brief... <3 !
It's very weird hearing Neil speak in a way that isn't very documentary toned XD
150 billion stars born per year
Is science related to science?
His tie is out of this world!
MIND BLOWING
I freaking love science
Uvinerse FOR DuMMIEs
I love Neil.
I see JEON. my soul whispers jungkook~. and I realize imma bts trash.
I dont know Complication
2:43 Dark Energy*
I have question sir, humans reached moon pretty quickly from the time rockets capable of reaching space was built. Why is it then taking so much time for us to land on Mars.
Is this guy really still around belting off theory as fact. You and your nwo buddies should take a long walk off a short pier!
exo...planets...\n\nany exols & kpop fans out there??
But is math related to science?
Are words flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup, Do they slither while they pass, do they slip away across the universe?
3:30 me talking about god
Someone answer this question? Everyone gives me different answer. If Blue flame is the hottest,  then why sun is not blue????
100 stars are born every year, huh? Has he ever seen a star form? Has anyone ever seen a star form? As I understand it star formation is laden with theoretical problems and may in fact be impossible.
But he is more an actor, he is not at the level of scientist...
I heard you stole a seat from someone at the conference?

plz i want 8 plus space gray abdimoh1598@gmail.com i dont have twitter plaz i want iphone 8 plus ig is @a.moh_19
2:45 whats that crackiling??
Squeezable edge over headphone jack!? No one wants that shit #justiceForWiredHeadphones
Preference \n3rd oneplus 5\n2nd iPhone X\n\n\n\n\n1st pixel XL2
difference between the iphone 7, 8, X and Note 8 as they do the blur effect live and not after you take the photo. you can see the blur while taking the photo
side by side with lgv30 thanks.
Wish the XL came in Kinda Blue
I have no idea what Google was thinking when they designed the Google Pixel 2. It looks outdated and is overpriced.  The company is also hypocritical for making fun of Apple for their removal of the headphone jack, while they do the same thing a year later. Of course, Android fans will say that it is innovation rather than bashing them like they did with Apple.
I’m team iPhone but I wouldn’t mind switching to a pixel
Good to see the next generation of Pixel. A really great alternative to Samsung crapware.
How do you listen to music
Always on looks bland compared to others . I hope it can be customised
Cameras are dope
tbh portrait mode looks like a photoshop
That ISSA 21 savage ! 👌🏾👌🏾
$399 nope
tailosive tech got his video demonetized because he said bad things about the pixel 2
Waiting for the lg v30 comparison excited to see vs with pixel xl 2 vs iphone 8, X and samsung galaxy note and 8s
Awesome Pixel 2!! Will it be available in Malaysia?
How the hell do you fumble with voice assistant? You literally just have to ask what song it is
Another question is why is Google not releasing a new tablet? I still have a Nexus 9 and would like a similar replacement that is all Google. Huawei makes great devices and may look at their tablets. I using a Mate 9 as a daily driver and it's still great. This is someone that bought the new Nexus device every year. I have not hopped on the Pixel wagon yet. Mate 9 was my Pixel XL.
That's awesome
Just awesome
Waiting for full review
That was cool! Your good at these videos!! (Props) Also you have some good information!! Hope some one who needs it wins your giveaways I want but people need
21 savage a banger🤙🏽☝️
It looks ugly
BEZEL BEZEL BEZEL BEZEL
Ugly crap
3:43 fuck face
0:20 Pixel 2 has AMOLED display i think . XL has POLED.
Bank Account?
It looks like a note 8 fugly clone
Colorizer? I think you mean circular polarizer.
My reaction....... booooorrriiinng.
Neither
Great video, I love your content you always do a great job. I have a quick question, Is the top bezel bigger than the bottom ? I don’t know if it’s my eyes or if it is.  thanks
Out of all of the reviews i watched, this is definitely one of the best videos. Very informative.
Can you please make a batman or nightwing theamed gaming setup because I would love to see that?!?!?!!!????!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!????!
Shit... You had me till The removal of the headphone jack :(
does it has status light??
Am I the only one that likes how the smaller pixel 2 looks? I mean honestly I'm in it for the front facing speakers, great software experience and optimization. I'm also tired of phablets as well so there's that.
the smaller one has only oled, the bigger one has poled
we want camera comparisons!! like if u agree
Ok this might sound dumb but what’s the difference between usb 2.0 and usb 3.0
Apple: We got the ugliest phone ever. Google: Hold my beer
Instead of making the thing thinner, google could implement a headphone jack, wireless charging, maybe a better battery and the camera wouldnt be sticking out..
Any of you guys think this phone beats the iPhone x? It has a pretty fair price
im gonna have to try it out myself too. the way it sounds is that google blew apple out of the water given what has been revealed in the past few weeks. if i heard right then pixel 2 has fast charing straight from the box, nothing additional to buy?! wow!
Does both phones have RGB notification light or not? I cannot find a concrete information anywhere.
Kinda Blue = Manatee. Come one Google, get on point with the color names.
No. Only LG phones have a 18:9 aspect ratio, that's why the top and bottom bezels are bigger. The s8 and note 8 have 18,5:9 displays, thus utilizing more of the space on the front
Did anyone else notice something strange at 3:09-3:10 with the blur that it applied in the third portrait shot where he was standing _behind_ the camera? It looks like it kept him in focus but blurred the camera out. :/ Technically both he and the camera should be in focus while everything in the background is blurred. I'm guessing it's probably because the machine learning looks for a human and keeps that in focus while making everything else blurry.
Easily the best preview on the Pixel 2 and 2 XL! Still on the fence whether to get the Pixel 2 or 2 XL.  I have a red iPhone 7 plus, but not a fan of the size.  The smaller Pixel 2 would be perfect, but will the dated look bother me - hmmm
the smaller pixel 2 has an AMOLED panel not a POLED
Can i get that iphone 8 please i still got a iphone 5s , my instagram is vstacks_
What about HDR 10 or Dolby Vision support? Google didn't say a word about it.
Lol evidently you need to memorize more of your music library. :P
The phone isn't that impressive unless you're into stock android. Its like all the reviewers are forced to say positive things about the device. If any othe OEM released a phone with similar features they'd butcher it. They practically did already tho... HTC, Bixby button etc.
These phones are way better than the iPhone 8
Pro-tip: Better sound quality with Bluetooth on Android O is already possible. Thank you Sony. Activate developer options and you will see the new LDAC codec as selectable, which allows audio streaming up to 990kbps. You can also now select the sampling rate and sample size.
So savage to blur out that other guy (his army is coming to get you)
I have an s8, I feel like getting these phones isn't really an upgrade. But your getting fast updates, pure Android experience but no headphone jack, no face or iris scanner, less water resistance..... Decisions decisions.....
The phone sounds great but I don't think the display looks that appealing, it looks washed out. The tech in the phone sounds amazing!
so the only complaints i see on this phone are with looks and headphone jack. So like, the least important aspects of a phone are what people complain about. LoL
I’m wondering which one is better between LG v30 and pixel2 XL in term of daily performance.
That’s a lit phone
Great informational review. Like always, great video.
I am excited about Pixel 2 XL, but damn, I live in Latin America, and here, they don't sell those phones.\nFor Google, we are so poor and we do not cover their needs, that's why we aren't gonna see Google in a near future.\nGreetings from Mexico City, Mexico.
Blah blah blah. If you want great camera, get a DSLR.
Astute watchers will ponder whether he got coffee with Kyle or not...
This phone looks like a winner. Sure, it has a little bit of bezels, but it’s functionality and camera make up for it...And that unlimited photo/video cloud storage. Hyped.
Fantastic video ! I'm not even going to buy the Pixel but I enjoyed this. Thanks.
No headphone jack🤔 I thought they liked that thing.I guess they’ll be copying Apple from now on.
The normal one would look and prob just feel alot better with curved edges.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this is coming from a g6 user
It's called a polarizer my dude
please someone tell me the diference betwen this and the samsung s8. i mean even google lens= bixby vision
Why is the flash and the camera swapped on some, but Normal on others?
I'm buying! Was going for the V30 but saw it today at Verizon and it's much wider than i thought. The V30 wasn't a very comfortable fit in my hand.
Honestly, i dont really like the new design i kind of like the old design better but thats just how i feel
Best thing is the front firing speakers 👍
Personally I would love it if you do a video showing and comparing a few sound options. E.g how does audio sound using regular corded in ear earphones over the provided dongle? Would buying a different dongle improve sound? How does audio over the dongle compare to audio from the 3.5mm jack on first pixel. Perhaps also test some native usbc headsets and Bluetooth options so we can get a better understanding of sound quality across the different options we now have.
The front panel on the Pixel 2 looks really cheap compared to the XL.
XL looks ok, but Pixel is really meh~ 2015 looking. First iPhone then Pixel, I don't appreciate they are doing this. Just give us the best only!
Definitely looking forward to the in depth review. Also get a hold of Google's new headphones and do a review on them.
Honestly if you’re upgrading from an older phone with big bezels then the bezels on the smaller pizel won’t be a big deal. I just got an IPhone 8 Plus and I’ve never been like “wow this phone is so unwieldy”
Why do people keep whining about no headphone jack? Like really it has 2 stereo speakers, the reason for a headphone is to make it sound louder or to stop people from hearing what you hear, if you use headphones to make it louder, you don't have to now because of those 2 stereo speakers
I can’t wait to get my hands on this phone.
I have the first Google pixel and it's utter garbage, so im definitely not getting either of these.
I want the iphone! Please!
Can anyone comment on why every video of the XL the display looks washed out.
Why are the names so dumb?
Wow was planning on getting one but it is ugly
chin and forehead are too big on the pixel 2.
I'm I the only one who doesn't get the sudden obsession with bezel size?
No headphone jack, No micro SD card slot, Not water resistant = Pass
Well that was very disappointing. When I saw Google mocking Apple for removing their head phone jack i thought this would ensure the jack to stay in the pixel 2.   CONS: No head phone jack, added camera hump, thick bezels are my deal breakers. I'll stick to my Nexus 6P for another year.
Those wireless assistant buds are a shitty excuse to remove the jack. They could make a first iteration of wired g. Assistant earbuds using the phone's tech reducing weight on them. Also keeping the 3.5mm
Sometimes reporting on these things hits me hard. I know I've said it before, and I'll continue to say it but please call, text, email, or better yet tell someone in person you love them today. The world can be so cruel and our time isn't guaranteed. In case someone hasn't said it to you today, I love ya, Nation. <3
Paddoch got pissed at the world because he lost his phony little slip & fall law suit.
People say thoughts and prayers\n\nHere is what I have to say to that: \nFuck.\nThat.\n\nThoughts and prayers never saved anyone. Where was God when all those innocent people lost their lives? Stop living in a dream, people. Instead of saying thoughts and prayers every time something like this happens, do something about it.\n\nLet's face the problem. Guns. Guns are the problem. Without guns there wouldn't be mass shootings. It's that simple. Of course, there will still be murder. It's human nature after all, but people won't be able to spray down a concert hall full of people with a machine gun, if only you gun crazed idiot rednecks would let go of, let's face it, your expensive toys.\n\nIf your enjoyment of shooting targets on the weekends outweigh the lives of others, you are a sick and twisted person. People are dying, can't you see? Why do you need an assault rifle for self-protection?\n\nIt's time to weigh your priorities. Freedom and liberty don't mean shit if your children are ducking bullets at school. Dead people don't have freedom.
Why do 3k people dislike this?
This is absurd that youtube was under attack by our own government just because people said and gave their own evidence that it was a conspiracy. This right here proves that the FBI and the US government do not want the public to think that for specific reasons. Certain posts were banned but if the theory of a conspiracy was under attack as it was then there is more to the story then what was told by mainstream news. Mr Paddock was not mentally ill. There was no surveillance footage released showing Stephen entering the hotel room or lobby with a suspicious arsenal of weapons.The investigation was rushed when the weapons were found in his room and he was the only one in there. He could have been a victim of a setup and used as a patsy which is highly plausible due to the information about uncovered about himself being a peaceful wealthy man. The investigation only used circumstantial evidence to pin the murders on Stephen Paddock. This smells fishy and you need hard forensic evidence to conclude an investigation. It is not hard to make a man look like he shot himself if you know what you are doing. I would say due to the lack of evidence in the investigation there is a high probability that there is something the US government does not want you to know. If this was a shooting committed by others the motive was clear to enforce strict regulations of Gun control and an excuse to go after countries that harbor members of Isis and any other terrorist groups alike.
0:00 Dude, fuck what you're talking about, I had a great day that day and view it as such. I don't live my life in direct correlation to whatever happens, good or bad, everywhere else in the US or the world. Don't you dare speak for other people.
This was disgusting
His name is Stephen Paddock and he is at the center of this which means it is important to talk about him. It does no good to not talk about him. Talking about the heroes of this event will not stop the next terrorist and having hope will not stop the next one. Thoughts and prayers won't either. Real journalism will and you're a part of that. Complete the picture by talking about the gunman. Calling him names or bad mouthing him is not going to help. In fact, he may have a mental disorder in which case we'd have to talk about mental disorders which means the most important human brains to talk about are the ones that actually did something like this, not just the ones that may theoretically be driven to. Stephen Paddock is famous, whether you like it or not. Now we need to talk about him and piece this together.
I feel like there had to be more then one shooter... & I definitely think there should be more control over what weapons are being sold...  I was just at a county music concert a few weeks ago and I don't even want to imagine how it was to go though sometime like this, It's so sad , so many inocente life's gone 😕
The news said that Isis said they denied any involvement in the Las Vegas shooting. But the shooter said otherwise in a book he wrote in along with other guns in his hotel room. How did he bring in such big guns without the hotel noticing anything weird
its a normal day why coz its not you know who is not init.thats why its not all over in the news
3:33 wow... The child of porn legend Johnny Sins' took one of his behind the scenes glamor shots and tweeted it out as a fake missing persons plea. He must be so embarrassed right now.
The Nevada legal definition of terrorism is different from the actual definition of terrorism...
Philip DeFranco \nGREAT JOB PHILIP!!!!!!!!\nON TELLING THE TRUTH, AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH!!!!!!\nYOU DID A GREAT JOB POSTING THE FACTS AT THE TIME YOU KNEW WHAT YOU DID.\nNOTHING HAS CHANGED SINCE YOU MADE THIS VIDEO.\nTHAT IS VERY VERY GOOD ON YOU, AND YOUR STAFFS BEHAVE!! \nKEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!!!!!<3
Big question: Who are the ones disliking this video? Is there literally 3,000 trolls watching this video just to dislike it?? He's merely discussing a tragedy and giving information in order to help the victims. I'm so not clear what is there to freaking dislike?!?!?!?!
I need to make money off a tragedy buy masking it with a fundraiser is the true title.
ISIS trying to be responsible dat fuzzed up \n\n\n\n\n\ncause they want to save the shooter \n\n\n\n\n\nS.M.H
But Is he a Terrorist  yes or no?
The American people need to stand up to this continual gun crimes - Start marches and demonstrations -please keep them peaceful  but make sure the government gets the message monthly demonstrations will be great. \n\nI suggest americans  have marches and ensure  that the government pass new legislation to have  more gun control  since without marches more shootings will occur in the future. \n\nThe  Trump government or any other american government will not be able to help you when new shootings begin.\n\n I feel great sympathy for those shot in Las Vegas, but the only way to stop more shootings the american people must demonstrate otherwise the government will continue and allow guns to be sold to any one. \n\nThe best way is to stop all guns being sold - why doesn't the american government act  now---or have a referendum  let the people
Yo Phil open your eyes it's a false flag attack by the Cia
I will say what I've said since leaning the difference between Canada's gun laws and Americas gun laws. \nYou can't act surprised when a weapon of war is used to kill people.\nModern automatic and semiautomatic rifles, pistols, machine and sub machine guns are weapons of war.\nThey are designed to do 1 thing and 1 thing only. Kill and harm human beings. That was their main design and not only that but they were designed to be user friendly. To be efficient in live combat.\nThere's a reason you didn't have mass shootings in the wild west. All they had were revolver pistols and rifles, bolt and lever action rifles and barreled or lever action shotguns.\nThose guns are not designed for war, they are designed mainly for hunting.
I really can’t stand this bullshit anymore. I feel like a parent who’s disappointed in their children. Every time some shooting happens I usually brush it off and forget, but good god damn this one just hurts. I can’t understand it. The more I see and read, I mean, it’s just rough. I can’t understand why anyone would do this to people. Innocent people just going to listen to some music. I hate what the world is becoming. I hate that I have to raise my son in such a fucked up, unsafe world.
Las Vegas was a false flag.
You did this with your hands like every time
I listened to an old interview with Kingsley Amis today and he said in that interview he was just glad people could love who they wanted and the era of wars was over and the world is a safer place and then I saw this.
I honestly don't think the actual killer is dead. Why do something like this for fame if you're not going to be around to bask in the glory of your accomplishment, being that was his goal. I am not saying I agree with what he did because that's f@%#ed. All I am saying is if it's soo easy to frame an innocent person and send them to prison. It's actually easier to frame a recently dead guy. he killed 55 people before police found him, yet I would bet money that the evidence to convict said would be killer was just another victim.
My Family [military some music fans with friends and an UNLV ex employee with former students there] thanks you.
I'm really sad that I can't donate blood because of how small I am.
When you act like a good person by saying you're not monetizing this video, but it's against YouTube policy to monetize a video of a tragedy in the first place.
The recipe of shootings like this is pretty set in stone. Big shooting happens. Everyone runs around like headless chickens spewing anything that could even be remotely connected to it. Or at the very least may appear to be connected. Then there's the crazies and idiots that deliberately lie about responsibility and spread false info. And then about 2-3 days follows of a giant clusterfuck of all sorts of bullshit floods the info lanes. Slowing down the real information getting to the forefront. Then it starts turning into the same old song and dance called gun control where the usual suspects scream at each other from the safety of their little internet fort.\n\nQuite frankly, its rather annoying. Wish people who have no fucking clue what's going on did some basic legwork before spewing nonsense. And those deliberately lying just stop. Also, if you want to talk gun control. How about you focus on making it harder to obtain illegal weapons, or obtaining weapons illegally in general. I get it, you want some regulations in place for how to legally obtaining weapons. But you're never going to be able to properly adjust for that unless you deal with the illegal side off it first.
American people deserve to see the note left behind in the hotel room.
gabby giffords and her nasa freemason astronaut husband are also part of the fake deceptions!!!!)
People in main steam media love BAD and TRAGIC news.  It increases their viewership
More gun control, thoughts and prayers, banning things, government control and making more laws is NOT going to stop massacres. If someone wants to kill a mass amount of people, they will find a way to do it one way or another. I really wish people would stop believing that more government control needs to be established, I couldn’t think of a more wrong way to go about horrible situations like this.
What's really starting to upset me, is the fact that this stuff is no longer getting to me. I'm rapidly reaching the point that I just don't care when this stuff happens. Nobody wants to solve the problems. It's just hand wringing, defenses from gun fanatics, pressure to do something, thoughts and prayers and then nothing happens. We turned flying into one of the most anguishing experiences after 9/11 but after how many mass shootings we still won't do anything about this problem? We're gonna keep making better and better guns while making them relatively easy to get and defunding mental health services at the same time? Yeah, no. Nothing could possibly go wrong with that.
The number 32 will always be my favorite number because it always seems to pop up in the weirdest of ways, but sure wasn't ever expecting to hear it was the floor that a mass murderer was shooting people from. Thats definitely one of the top weirdest ones.
DUDE YOU MUST BREATH THROUGH YOUR EARS CAUSE YOUR NEVER STOP TALKING . . . . .
Look this is a horrible situation, but i have a suggestion Phil, you have a great news channel but maybe instead of not getting the money from these videos, just get them and donate them to charities that involve that tragedy.
1. Steven is not a mass murderer he is a victim of the Las Vegas 'set up' to push gun control legislation on Americans.... he is the 60th victim of this deep state massacre!!\n2. Giving up your guns when you have a psychopathic untouchable deep state prepared to lay waste to your people in order to acheive their political agenda is pure insanity!!\n3 The factual inconsistencies in this narrative are irreconcilable with this man being an antifa lone wolf mass muderer.\n* What about the 2 women who ran through the crowd telling everyone you are all about to die. \n*What about the footage of light given off by rifle fire on the 12th or 13th floor and the lack of it on the 32nd floor\n*what about the footage captured by the female taxi driver where you can hear gunshots coming from different places simultaneously and basically on top of each other...impossible for a single shooter to be two places at once \n* How convenient for him to shoot himself and not have to be questioned or even hold up in the room keeping authorities at bay for any duration of time.\n*what about FEMA who just happened to be holding a terrorism drill that weekend -(who knew holding a terrorism drill was code for staging a mass shooting)\nNote to self - stay away from wherever FEMA is holding 'terrerorism drills'!!!\n* what about the photos showing a chest wound in addition to his head wound\n* why the gloves for a man with ZERO interest or knowledge of guns\n* how could a man without gun knowledge and training use the rifle so well first time\n* how did he get all those guns and bullets passed newly installed metal detectors\n* what about the 3 news stations who began reporting the incident BEFORE it began...let that sink in...ready🎥 ....and action🎬!!! \n* What about his neighbour and drinking buddy who said he was a TRUMP SUPPORTER with ZERO interest in guns and the friendliest guy on the planet. \n- That's why he's dead btw they needed someone accessible and trusting enough to befriend a stranger and take them into their hotel room and be set up and that was all this friendly social affable guy did wrong...he walked right into being the perfect patsy!!!\n...more footage from security cameras inside and outside of the hotel and eye witness acounts from staff and concert goers are going to lead to even more inconsistencies, the official narrative is an unsubstantiated insult to intelligence!!
Condolences to everyone affected, My heart goes to all of you and I wish you the strength for the hard times to come. This is my opinion but in a DUI we blame the driver, in a bombing we blame the bomber but why in a shooting do we blame the gun? even if guns were banned entirely bad people will find a way to get them, like most illegal things. Yes gun regulation needs a look at but if someone good has a gun at the right time and the right place that's lives that could be saved. Bad people will find a way and D-bags will be D-bags, nothing changes that, this guy might've been sick or whatever, doesn't change the fact he was a bad person and that he just needs to be forgotten, we remember the people affected and will honor their names but not the d-bag.
Thank you, Philip. I'm saddened by the fact that so many are using this situation to spread more theories and dramatics about things unrelated, unprovable, and unnecessary when we should be focused on the real topics at hand. When we should see an event like this and come together as a nation, as a people and make changes happen to help prevent this type of thing in the future.
The fake victim, 3:33, on the right is a porn star i believe.
Bump fire stocks dont sound like that. Sounds like a M240 Bravo. just another deep state bullshit.
Finally a guy with common sense! I hate how the media seems glorify these acts of violence!\nGun control, isn't the problem! Mental Health issues and society itself is the problem!
You would think that Aldean would have told people to run over his microphone. The POS, p*ssy.
Too bad no one believes it.
I get not showing the killers face so you can deny some notoriety but showing a flag that has flown above hundreds to thousands of  brutal executions is doing the same exact thing. Anyone with knowledge of liveleak and a strong stomach has seen  human beings killed in the most brutal fashion (ie beheadings w det cord/having a car w prisoners shot at with an rpg/ drownings in a swimming pool/thrown from buildings). The Kurds I work with call ISIS 'dogs'. Don't say you won't show this guy and still raise the IS flag up shortly after. My 2¢, thanks.
If you want to shoot in Chicago guess what you do, drive to Indiana. Federal laws are needed.
Have we figured out a profile for all these terrorist in America?
You need to make your videos about gun control because you say that there will be a big debate over the next month but there won't!
This guy is an ignorant corporate puppet not able to comprehend the situation and how he is contributing to the downfall of his country. The government wants to abolish the second amendment for obvious reasons and if you would research outside of mainstream media you will find the lies fed to you are quite disturbing. Don't believe anything you are told, consider all information available and form your own opinion, Phillip de Franco is not qualified to give you any of this information.
Phil, it's motifs and videos like this is the reason why you've had rock solid respect in my book after many many years of watching.
the mass shooting was differently a false flag shooting im from texas and live in texas and they are already say more gun control fuck that if you try and take my guns my whole state will shoot.
Was the said man as a shooter, framed or scapegoated? It sounds really strange, like Oswald.
Not terrorism. I get that you want to place that on something for someone so evil but use the definition as intended so that we can distinguish the differences.
I wish people would stop making videos on this attack on my city before all the evidence comes out.   Today the local news is saying paddock might have accomplices and he had explosives in his cars and may have had an escape plan to cause more harm.   But go speak more about guns before we find out more of his motive and if he has  people that might be on the run that might cause something more heinous in the near future
it doesn't make sense.... why all the guns and not more ammo.... this stinks of false flag.
Your neutrality on the news reports is such a breath of fresh air in this bullshit world. All I've seen since this tragedy is conspiracy theories and gun control squabbles, as well as people blaming things totally unconnected. Almost nothing about the victims. Thank you Phil, for giving them the respect they deserve and for not giving the animal who did this the spotlight. I appreciate you so much.
I I think you're a great person with a great channel, but by not giving the identity of the perpetrator's name, you make ppl only more curious. They are less likely to search him up if his identity is revealed.
it hits me hard that murica kills zivils in the east like in syria everyday. Everyday hundreds of woman, children, babys getting killed from american bomb-carpets. Noone gives a shit. I mean, its sad that there was a man shooting 50 innocent people in las vegas. but this country is doing even more shit in wars they started by themself. wake up guys.
My mother was in Las Vegas for her one year anniversary with her new husband and they were in an Uber when all this happened. She called me at 2 AM letting me know she was OK. All I can think about is if she Uber to a little bit earlier maybe she would've gotten hurt and I feel so blessed that she's alright
Your very impartial I really enjoy your style of news presentation you try and cover all aspects and not swing left or right
Remember: The demographic of people responsible for the most deaths of human beings is governments (just in the 20th century we had Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, the Kims, Mussolini, and Saddam Hussein, amongst others) and gun bans don't apply to them. Gun ban = assigning wolves with the task of disarming the sheep to protect the peaceful sheep from the violent sheep.
Loved how he had the humility to leave out the like and subscribe part! Love ya Frankie ❤
So sad.
If I fell off my bike I'm pretty sure isis would claim responsibility.
Gun control vultures always swarm on tragic events. Funny how a guy targets a conservative majority event and conservatives get blamed.
I don’t want to be a part of the divisiveness anymore. I feel regret from taking a part in it. I’m done.
I live in Las Vegas, and the morning after this happened I got 4 texts asking if I was alright, and I read them before I even knew this happened and I was terrified.
You're a good dude, Phil. Always appreciate your reasonable level-headed stance on things, and I agree with not showing the name/face of the killer and focusing on the victims and people who help.

3:33 nope.
Donated and shared!
ALL THESE HAND GESTURES
Oh
No we dont, philip. no we dont.
Here are the facts.\nA man gets 400 pounds of equipment up 30 floors, past casino level hotel security, without being seen on camera, sets up a sniper nest, removed  a window that is composed of over 800 pounds of hurricane proof glass, then laid down fire for 10 minutes straight, with inconsistent weapon and bullet types based on sound, sometimes shooting two distinct successions of fire at the same time, using an illegal full auto weapon, that he apparently got from some gun store, despite his family saying he never even liked guns. \n\nThose are the facts. That is what apparently happened. If you think that sounds suspicious then you're an insensitive biggot.\n\nAlso, he somehow got rid of all the bullet casings. And the people he shot somehow bled bright red, almost pink paint like substances. None of the videos showing any bullet wounds.\n\nAlso somehow he got some people from other tragedies like Baltimore and sandy hook to show up. Same people. Doing the same things. Crying on the phone, playing dead, etc.\n\nHe also placed an ad on Craigslist far in advance advertising for an actor crowd. And was then led to a website where you can hire a crowd of actors for basically any purpose.\n\nYes. Those are the facts. Thank God every Hollywood liberal and government official didn't even wait until the bodies were cold to discuss gun control. What perfect timing.
I'm glad I don't live in America
It took over an hour to get to the shooter?! That just seems so wild to me. Even wilder is the fact he had 10 weapons on him. 10. Disgusting. My heart hurts so so badly for those killed and injured. Mental health evaluations in order to buy weapons is proving to be more and more important everyday.
So if you can't stop acts of violence  completely there shouldn't be any gun laws at all?? Someone explain that to me. if people don't have guns they'll find another way. So let's make it easy for them???
Imagine if a muslim did it.\nThe media would have blamed my religion.
Why gun control isn't a thing I'll never understand (apart from the fact gun companies sponsor the government)\n\nBut look, Australia banned guns after their worst massacre, haven't had one as bad since.
If you think gun control doesnt work you you are just ignorant of all the evidence. It works, its as simple as that. It reduces mass shootings, violent crime, suicides etc. countries with gun control are often just flat out better places to live, not some messed up oppressive regime
There was no spent brass on the floor in the shooter's room.
Tulsa Oklahoma???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
This just proves the point that terrorism can not just be accredited to foreign factions or terrorist groups. We need to understand that the threat can come from anywhere. Its so sad to say that we need to be vigilant about our own safety.
I'm not one for conspiracy theories but in the videos I've watched of the recent Las Vegas shootings you can clearly hear multiple automatic weapons fire from multiple different locations and it begs the question, why are the mainstream media trying to cover up the truth?!
yo phil the best case i can give you for proof of gun control working just look at australia
Trump visited the fake actors this don't look good for him if this really fake.
Argument: Gun control wouldn't work on criminals, therefore there's no point.\nCounter Argument: Making murder illegal hasn't worked on criminals, therefore there's no point in keeping it illegal. \nIt's the same argument. Can someone please take a 1st years philosophy class and learn about fallacies.
They should ban automobiles in europe cause obviously they can be used as terrorism
To all those Americans who feel their “freedom” will be impacted if their guns are taken away think of all the freedom you will gain being able to go to school and public events in peace. Starting to think Americans will never learn from their mistakes. Come to Australia we have no mass shootings and Sephora its a win win.
All these attacks happening in the world but VEGAS? Beautiful place and no high security? Just makes you wonder that nowhere is safe anymore. Heart goes out to those who lose their lives ❤
false flag, there were 2 shooters and its been caught on camera and on phone calls that were to at least 2 because gun shots sounds were coming from two different directions and i bet it was set up to disarm the american public.
Yep the world is dying. There no peace without conflict. There's no love without hate. Those were Thompson guns being shot out. Halloween massacre. This is why i say it was a Thompson https://youtu.be/x4QWrha3HLw it's the mafia. They usually hang in casinos. My whole life is based on nightmares so i don't care. We did terrorism in the past by blowing up Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Vietnam.
One man should not have that many guns! Gun control can make sure this would NEVER happen again! If that man was only allowed to have 1 gun then this mass shooting wouldn't of taken as many lives. I will not wait for another mass shooting, WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT! WE WONT LET THIS SLIDE! NO MORE MASS SHOOTINGS!!!!!!!!

[Verse 1]\nIt was wrong, well, it never worked\nOr at least I told myself\nTo not make it hurt\nI try to blast music\nIn attempt to get you out of my eyes\nBut I can't escape my mind\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI hate you 'cause I've always\nLook at your picture\nAnd I tell myself\nThat I'm over you\nBut then I get a little unsure\n\n[Chorus]\nI wish I could get you\nOut of my mind\nBut I think about it all the time\nAnd I wish I could not think\nFor once in my life\nBut when I see your face\nI can't escape my mind\n\n[Verse 2]\nI know we were never a thing\nBut I always think about\nWhat could've happened if we kept going\nAnd I never had this happen to me\nOnly in the movies\nBut honey it is happening\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI hate you 'cause I've always\nLook at your picture\nAnd I tell myself\nThat I'm over you\nBut then I get a little unsure\n\n[Chorus]\nI wish I could get you\nOut of my mind\nBut I think about it all the time\nAnd I wish I could not think\nFor once in my life\nBut when I see your face\nI can't escape my mind\n\n[Bridge]\nI can't escape my mind\nI wish I could turn it off sometimes\nOh, I can't escape my mind\nOh, no matter how hard I try\nI wish I could turn it off sometimes\n\n[Chorus]\nI wish I could get you\nOut of my mind\nBut I think about it all the time\nAnd I wish I could not think\nFor once in my life\nBut when I see your face\nI can't escape my mind
I haven't found one of her songs I don't like
This song can’t Escape My Mind 😏

Grace was on fire 2day at ACL in Tx.  Some great new songs, lots of energy, crowd was really into it. There are few clips on twitter & fan page, but you really needed to see her to appreciate.\nck this out you get a sense of what it was like https://mobile.twitter.com/967kissfm/status/916739678245711875/video/1

Grace really turns the studio musicians loose on this rocking song.
It doesn't matter whatever the lyrics is...her voice always gives me goosebumps ...

Amazing as usual!!!
I love it ♡♡
why is this so relatable?....
This is the first song of hers I've really liked.
i need to see a music video of this song ❤❤
Just heard her sing this at ACL.  HOLY CRAP she made it even more rocking, and actually sounded better than this version.  Her voice is so badass.
but who is she singing about?
Is she dating already?!?!? Did she make this song for that person she's dating???? Or did she just sing this song to sing it? But anyways it's still beautiful!!!
But no I was the one screaming Grace on AGT lol
i love you grace vanderwaal
The band they used for Grace today should be the regular get go from now on.
Anyone like the Beatles? I just did a cover of And I Love Her on my channel. Please please go watch it maybe? No one? Ok cool.
So this video shows the love from the fans, the other is their best moment together, Talking to myself shows their best moment in 2017(eventhough this year is absolutely 🐶💩)😭😭😭
you are still alive in our hearts #chester....miss you a lot lot lot.......where ever you are you will be happy
I miss you so.r.i.p. Chester
I love linkin park\nCHESTER COOL!

Love and respect for what you left behind chester, hope your soul is at peace Legend, Forever LP.

So beautiful and heartbraking.. Miss you Chester.. Have a blast and rest good wherever you are ❤❤❤
Fucking egoistic son of a hoe leaving behind 6 kids and your wife. No money in the world can compensate their pain and you should think of them first before killing yourself. Holy fuck.
This song is so meaningful and relevant to modern life Chester you were an amazing beautiful soul and you will long be missed RIP
I miss Chester.......he was my hero..............When I fould out that he died I cry forevery......you always be rembered Chester.
YOUR FANS FROM MALAYSIA MISS U SO MUCH CHESTER! 😭
I'm 48. All of my life I've been listened to the other kind of music until heard «one more light». Since then I realized how much I've missed and lost. You brought one more light to my life, Chester. It's so sorry, there are things we can't have anymore, but for sure we must them keep. With deep respect from Russia… RIP
How many songs could they still have done? I would like to go to a dimension that these songs exist ;-;
We won't never forget you and your legend.
I can't believe that Chester died his steel live cause this voice is from chester
I'm currently going through depression myself. I lost my whole family and my longtime girlfriend to cancer. I miss you ma. I miss you dad. I miss you Sarah :( we miss you Chester. RIP 1976-2017
Whoever the 1k dislikes are I'm gonna hurt them okay
I'm just crying. I can't do something else than crying
It's not the same without Chester
I cry r.i.p we will not forget you
I miss both Chester Bennington and his best friend Chris cornell😢😢😢.
We miss you Chester ...  You were the cure for my tears all my childhood

I’d guess the Taco Bell one right away
i would choose Tom Cruise to be my mom.
The only one I would have a chance of getting would be Taco Bell bc I haven’t eaten or even heard of any other restaurant 😂
I got a little poke 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The amount of times Link left Rhett hanging in this episode XD
Wouldn’t Sauce Boss be better?
I want Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister) to be my mom. Nobody will mess with me at school.
yo what happened to link at the end when he said subscribing. glitched right out
Wont those rubber gloves make the sauces taste like condoms?
I like it better when they tell them the right answer after they answer so they can reevaluate their whole lives.
As you can see, we can't\n\n\n\n\nI should put that on a plaque
How about PB CUP taste test?
Watching Rhett and Link suck hot sauce off a gloved finger because pornhub was down. (I'm sorry)
There's a Jack in the Box 30 minutes away from my house, which also happens to be right by my favorite park. My favorite thing to do is drive up there, chill at the park, then get 4 tacos from JITB 😂 I live in Ohio so they're not common at all, but I love their tacos.
I'm the best!\nNo, I'm the best!
as you can see we cant dunno why that cracked me up
Isnt it  Frankensauce not Saucenstein

If i had to respond to the qtmba, i would have to say it would have to be  hugh jackman. That's right i said something that was counter intuitive, but i wouldn't mind having a fatherly mother.
As you can see we can't.\n-gets me every time :3
You guys need to do a progressively spicier noodle challenge. 1. NORMAL ramen noodles 2. CHILI ramen noodles 3. SHIN ramyun noodles 4. SAMYANG hot ramen noodles 5. SAMYANG super hot ramen noodles. 6. Rhett and Link Select+ Ultra spicy noodles
I hope everything is okay between the two of them. I don't know why but something seems off after watching some of their videos. Is that just me??

Link: [due to mix of love & guilt, refuses to pick a celebrity mom]\nRhett: [without skipping a beat] I pick Cher\nXDD

You should do a powdered food taste test, like if you agree.

I love autumn and am (shamefully unashamedly) kind of enjoying how it’s becoming a brand or thing. It’s cosier, I want to be spooky but in a joyous way. Ha. I don’t buy any thing pumpkin spice but I do read gothicly and kick leaves.
I love you Lex. Never change. (Unless you want to it's all cool man it's your life)
Yes. I am pro joy.
This is interesting because I am someone who gets really heavily affected by SAD, and autumn has alwayyys been my least favourite season as my depression seems to hit me the worst during it. But in recent years it's started to grow on me, and I think a lot of that IS the grandeur that comes with the commercializations of autumn. Before when summer ended all I'd do is dread the lack of sunshine in the coming months, the rain and my seasonal affective disorder inevitably kicking in, and even though that's all still true, it's like my brain can be distracted like yeah it's going to get gloomy out, but pumpkin spice lattes are back!! Halloween decor! Cozy spooky evenings!! and even though it's all done with the intent to sell stuff, I can't say I mind it for what it's worth.
I was so convinced there was a window to the left of the fireplace but now there's all this space there...and objects...I don't know who I am anymore
this is the only comment section which is fun to read and has no awful comments! Good children
They only meet our needs and what we demand. I dont hate commercialization. Seasons give people inspiration to switch things up to attract customers.\nThe only problem I have is that small business dont really benefit from it as  much as much as large corporations.\nI love small business. too bad nobody cares about it anymore & just runs to their local starbucks smh
I dislike autumn but I respect people's rights to celebrate and enjoy it with items. :P and I agree, who am I to deny someone their right to make themselves feel better with socks and things? if those things worked on me to convince me that this is an enjoyable season, hell I'd be doing the same!
You look like that one girl from that black mirror episode
I just don't like the fact that people associate buying things with being happy... I love autumn but I hate consumerism
Thank you! I really don't want to hate on vloggers who peddle all their wares as I think we all know those arguments inside out, but I am truly agog at the amount of junk that some of them churn out. Zoella must have more than 40 different (incredibly generic) products out at the moment, all of which she is totally nuts about and LOVES. I really struggle with this as all i see it as is them taking advantage of young viewership who aspire to their lifestyle, sucking them dry of pocket money etc. I am basically a commie so realise comment is very null in void but imagine the influencers used their following to promote environmentally conscious pratices etc.
Fine decoration is not a matter of being rich or poor babe but of personal taste. Luv!
I've always loved this time of year, I love fireworks night, thanksgiving, my birthday! The colours of leaves! And the flavours associated with autumn! I also am one of the few people who doesn't like summer so when it gets cold and rainy Im Very happy! I don't have much money so can't exactly buy into it but I love watching autumn hauls or vlogs where other people have - I guess I get my autumn fix vicariously through that!
I don't like wearing summer colours so autumn makes my normal seem more ...fashionable? Autumn is quite stressful because i never know whether i should wear a coat or not.
I have never heard a convincing argument for Autumn's commercialisation till now! .. \n\nJust one problem in my context. Stop trying to make Halloween a thing in Australia (at companies). There is no justification for it. You want to know why?....... Because it is freakin SPRING!
See in florida fall is the end of terrible weather and the beginning of pleasant weather
I love your hair!
Run my children! Be basic! I love it!!! Hahaha
I love autumn (or fall because America), but I live in Texas now... Fall only exists inside my apartment. :'(
The suggested video after this was Zoella's autumn homeware haul
I was just thinking the other day about how strange I find it when people aggressively autumn-decorate. I love cosiness but I'm also lazy...
I used to only enjoy spring, but since I found proper medication and don't get depressed anymore, I've started to warm up (get it) to autumn and winter. I still hate summer as I can't stand humidity and heat and am a very sweaty person, but without the prospect of crippling depression inching closer I'm just relieved I can finally cover up in big sweaters and ridiculously huge scarfs and not sweat the whole time again. And the (admittedly scarce) sun this time of year is actually enjoyable and nice and warm instead of something to avoid at all costs.
Somehow a three minute video from you leaves one with the impression of having absorbed at least 20 mins of emotionally charged, informed, and relevant content. More so than most actually 20 min long videos. How'd you do that, Lex?
Be basic, be merry in the leaves is going to be my motto for the season.
Interestingly it's because of this commercialisation of Autumn that I feel most disconnected from the world just because I live in Australia. We don't really have any of the stuff going on now when it's Autumn for us, which I'm guessing is because it's not a big enough market. Or maybe it's because it would clash with the majority of what we consume, which is American and British trends and media. We already have all of the winter-geared Christmas stuff when we are melting in 40 degree Celcius weather.
I love autumn and glumglum sadness season! I'm born in autumn and have always associated it with happy times :)\n\n(Unfortunately there's no pret where I live and the seasonal starbucks drinks aren't vegan)
It's always odd for me because summer is always the absolute worst for me, I don't sleep, my depression is a lot worse and I have nightly panic attacks. Autumn is like a 'thank fuck that's over' for me.
I definitely agree that celebrating every season including the miserable ones is a good thing. Part of living in the now and enjoying the present instead of always hanging out for summer. However being in the southern hemisphere it is very confusing when everyone starts getting autumnal while here we are getting 25+ degree days again!
Unrelated but I do appreciate your eye-makeup and thats saying something because I usually dont notice makeup or care for it much... Anyway its lovely.
And like where is all the fall themed music? Everyone sings about summer and winter and spring but why doesn’t anyone sing about the best goddamn season we get?!
I'm from central California and it is ALWAYS AND FOREVER hot except for the bless-ed few cold weeks we get between early November and late January before it turns stuffy and hot again, so I've always loved autumn because it's the only time I'm not boiling hot or sweating slightly. The first excuse I get to wear a cardigan and not sweat to death I am THERE. also I was born in November so autumn time is in my nature.
Please don't say you're not young! I'm only a year or two younger than you and you feeling old makes me feel old!\n(You thought this was going to be a kind uplifting comment but really I'm just selfish hurrhurrr)
i had just started thinking about this this autumn, thanks for putting it in words!
I love autumn and I love cozy socks and scented candles, and I love everything about it. Sorry. Take my money.
I don't get the big fuss about autumn. Like sure, the leaves turn orange and it gets a bit windy. No need to go conkers over it.
Autumn rules, I love cracking out my coats and jumpers. And if people want to buy flavoured coffee and warm clothes, is that such a bad thing?
See, I'm not a fan of sunlight. So Autumn is a boon as far as I am concerned. Heck, I was married on Halloween.
I feel like you and Noel Fielding would be a dream team
this is slightly ironic, given the video but...where did you get your jumper??? I need it in my life
Thank you, I will ♡
Do you have a source for that spooky statistic claim? Fascinating.
Thank you for raising S.A.D. Lex, it's a pain in the arse to say the least
IT'S COLD SELL ME WARMTH AND COMFORT PLS THX
the commercialism of autumn doesn't really bother me that much. \n\nit's mainly cos I can't get behind the products/campaigns as a lot of them aren't of much interest to me like for example pumpkin spiced latte's (I absolutely hate coffee and milk)
One thing I'm not keen on about the commercialisation of Autumn is after one cooler day you're inundated with ads about cosy jumpers and instead of enjoying the last nice days of summer it imbues it with a sense of desperation?! Mind you I am one of the people for whom worse weather means bad times so I guess I'm not the target audience. Love your videos Lex!
I don’t think it’s deep, just how the world is, the market sees that people enjoy cosy socks and hot coco in the colder months, to pay the bills this month they sell cosy socks and hot coco
Did you dye your hair pink? x
Absolutely dislike autumn, strongly hate the cold. But nothing beats a dark autumn night, lots of rain and wind, when Im sitting inside my place with coco, next to a radiator, reading a book, wearing knitwear hugged by my teddy and a blanket. Still want summer back tbh.
This is a v interesting topic which I probably should comment on but also where is your jumper from?
Spring is the best season handsdown
I hate capitalism. :( I prefer being cosy with my wife than luxuries.
A bit off-topic: it’s SO nice to see that your home is not all blogger-y, with fairy lights and matching decor. It’s cozy! And lived in! And just a normal home. ❤️
I'm thrilled to have less humidity and bugs and more autumnal colors in the trees even if it means my tomatoes are dying and I can't make fresh pesto anymore.
I love the shattered illusion tbh
High quality description 10/10
(Also Over the Garden Wall has REALLY helped me romanticize autumn)
CAT
LOVE the description
KITTEH!!!!

Toy Story 2 was alright.
Autumn's a filthy casual.
You live in central London? I thought that was impossible....
Up next: Autumn Homeware Haul. Loving Autumn: yay, pro-joy. I have noticed more Autumn (insert capitalism here) vids on Youtube. I kinda don't like the idea that we have to change our whole wardrobe and decor when the seasons change. Surely most people just get out their jumpers/jackets/scarves, put away their summer dresses and leave their interiors pretty much the same. I love decorating my house for xmas as much as the next person but I don't change the cushions or the bedding... Where would I keep the spare stuff?! I ain't got space for storing this stuff when I'm not using it, let alone the bother or money to buy it all.
NO
Honestly I love commercialised autumn/christmas.
I love autumn and it's getting hotter in New Zealand now but I'll be in the USA soon and I'm way too excited to see how they do autumn and buy into all this shit hahaha
See this is why I love springtime. I know that it can get categorised as being 'Easter', but on the whole, aside from pastel colours, spring is left alone more so than summer (BIKINI BODIES SUMMER HOLIDAYS THERE ARE CHILDREN EVERYWHERE), winter (Christmas and New Years) and Autumn (Halloween and Bonfire night etc). I feel extremely rejuvenated during the transitional seasons of spring and autumn, and I find myself craving the change in my environment as I live in the countryside so I get the full scope of the season change in trees and such. I do love autumn, and will wear cosy jumpers and nestle up by the fire, but the commercialism of Autumn is getting a little wearing. If I have to see another Instagram post which is a list of things to do in autumn like go to a pumpkin patch and buy an autumn scented candle in a cute pair of boots, I will scream.
Either the compression in YouTube is off the charts or you appear to have aged more than 15 years in a short amount of time
I hate the cold. Summer is the only time I feel cute and able to look like my body is mine. I hate the cold and I hate having to wear layers that make me feel fat and frumpy and I hate chapped lips and raw noses and my eyes tearing from the cold and the wind and I hate the rain and the snow and the wet socks and frozen fingers. \nBUT!!! Commercialization of autumn and winter (which is just Halloween and Christmas, lets be honest) is actually getting me excited for the season! I am looking forward to autumn dresses and christmas sweaters and going to a Harry Potter themed halloween party, and getting and giving presents on christmas and pumpkin pie and cinnamon things. the whole shebang, I'm excited.
but I do not understand how someone can enjoy the cold. IF THEY CAN, GOOD ON THEM, but I can't, it's too cold. I hate this season xD
완전 웃김 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
개맛있는데
6:45 억양에 치이고 갑니다
I’ve been binging on your channel! Love it!! Can’t believe I haven’t found yous sooner (I’m from the UK too!!)
That is absolutely the worst combination ever!! You guys must have been hungry. You ate so much of it.🤣
I think at the end all of you got sugar high 😂
감자튀김에 초콜릿은 아닌듯ㅠ
chocolate and waffle fries would probably be tasty
조엘 어깨 괴물인걸,,
시리얼 특집 ㄲㄲ
김치초콜릿 있는데...
JTBC에서 영국남자 하네 몰랐다...
조쉬 멋지당~~/♥♥/
둘이 왜저러삼 ㅜㅜ 맛나게 먹는 사람 생각도 좀 해주지 막 구역질까지야  ..참고로 전 먹어본적 없음 푸하하하
역시조엘ㅎㅎ웃음소리되게귀여워요!!취향이독특한가..??ㅋㅋ
조쉬님! 해리포터와 관련된 영국 도시나 그런 곳 가서 리뷰(?) 찍어주셨으면 좋겠어요😊 영국을 가지 못하기 때문에 대리만족이라도 정말 하고싶네요 !
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 로이스 초콜릿감자칩 맛있어요!
저거 진짜 맛없는데... 리뷰보고 드시지 ㅋㅋㅋ
조엘님의 리액션 충분히 공감이 갑니다. 한국사람이  김치에 초콜릿 소스를 뿌려서 먹는 느낌이었을 겁니다. 뇌에서 거부감이...
절대먹지말아야겟닼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ도전한다고 수고하셨어요~!
영국사람들에게 찜닭 먹이기 하면 좋겠다
초코 소스 치킨 너겟 & 백 맥..ㅎㄷㄷ \n세 분 촬영하시고 나서 뱃속은 괜찮으셨나요?ㅋ
Their Korean is really good
I usually just dip my fries in the chocolate sundae sauce 😂
이건좀아닌거같다
맥도날드에 초코 프라이 시키고 이거 봤는데.. 아직 배달안왔는ㄷ 어쩌면 좋나요..ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
얼마전에 jtbc에서 영국남자 영상나오던데 어떻게 된건가요?!
딸기, 초콜렛맛 뿌셔뿌셔가 금방 사라진 이유와 비슷한 느낌이겠죠ㅠㅠ
Doesn't everyone know that if you have the sauce on two sides, you would squeeze it? I mean like that's what's it like in Australia.
누가 조쉬 바지 찢어갔어요?😂
This is the first video I'm watching on this channel... is it bad that I'm amused by the transition between fluent Korean and London-accented English?
doesn't anyone else dip their fries in chocolate sundae? we have that thing going in the Philippines lol
HowToBasic?
Anyone? Fries + ice cream?
댄 왠지 ㅈㄴ친근하네
next time Gochujan-choco fries.
영국남자 맛있는 녀석들에 나와도 좋을듯
엥..먹을만하던데...근데 건강이 나빠지는 기분이 드는 맛이긴 함.  물론 맥날에서 건강해지는 맛이 있겠냐만은 초코감튀는 더욱 더.
홍어라던가 꼼장어라던가 해산물 편을 즐겨봤습니다! 슬슬 과메기에 도전해 보시는건 어떨까요?\n과메기...저는 못 먹는 과메기....대리만족하고 싶습니다ㅠ~ㅠ
티비에서도 방송이 되는줄 몰랐어요~ 재미있게 보고있어요 영국남자👍
한국 10대들의 유행어들을 배워보는 시간을 가져보는 것도 좋을 것 같아요! 줄임말 같은 경우도 한국은 ㅇㄱㄹㅇ, ㅂㅅ 처럼 자음만 적을 수도 있잖아요. 영어와 한국어의 유행어들을 비교해보는 시간을 가져봐도 좋을 것 같아요!

한국사람들이 외국인들이 한국피자먹고 역하다고 하는 영상보고 화내는거 보면 한국인들 진짜 하나만 생각하고 둘은 모른다는 생각든다. 조쉬가 말했듯이 한국사람들은 절대 김치에 초콜릿 안비벼 먹고 미국같은데에서는 그냥 중국음식이나 다른 아시아 음식과 함께 김치를 같이 파는 음식점 많다. 솔직히 그거 보면 얘네 아시아 음식에 대해 하나도 모르네 생각 할 수 있다. 서양인들도 똑같이 그렇게 생각 할수 있는데 우리는 그걸 이해를 못한다.
영국은 아니지만 미국에 있는 사이판 갔다가 왔어요 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 미국마트에서 여러 과자 아이스크림도 많이 팔고 많이 보던 음식들도 있었는데 다 이 채널로 보면서 익숙해져서 실제로 과자들을 봤을때  크게 신기해하거나 당황하지 않은거가타요 ㅜㅜㅜ 무엇보다 진짜 남성분들 얼굴 잘생기시고 너무 착하셨어요ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 하튼 감사하다구요 ♡♡♡ㅜㅜㅜㅜ
난맛있던데ㅜ초코소스 적어서 좀 짜증났음ㅜ
'식감'이란 단어가 나오고 난 생각보다 괜찮은데?란 한국어에 난 아닌데?로 바로 받아치는 영국인들이라니 ㅋㅋㅋ 볼수록 신기 ㅋㅋ어쨌든 저건 안사먹어야지
영상항상잘보고가요\n!!ㅋㅋㅋ\n저초코감튀맥날꺼궁금하네요...\n어제어떤푸드트럭에서저걸'악마의감자'인가?암튼고딴식으로팔길래사먹었는데진짜악마...초코가맛없긴처음..쏘덴졀
엄마가 먹는것갖고 장난치지말랬는데 이젠 식당에서 장난치네ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
너겟하고 빅맥에도 섞어먹을줄몰랐닽ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
한국 빅맥케이스 좋아요.. 인도네시아는 몇년 전부터 빅맥케이스가 치킨너깃케이스랑 비슷해 졌는데 햄버거 집어들면 양상추가 후두둑하고 떨어져요.. 진짜 귀찮아.. 휴...
근데 김치 초콜렛 있어요!!! 다음 도전은 이걸로 해보시면 어떨까요 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
미니언즈 바나나콘도 그렇고 와플 후라이도 그렇고 이것도 다 제 취향에는 안 맞네요.. 뭔가 맥도날드 신메뉴는 거르게 됩니다 ^^;
로이스 초콜릿에 감자칩+초콜릿 있는데 일본 맥도날드에서 그걸 보고 오 이거 해볼까? 한국 맥도날드에서 어 이거 우리도 해볼까? 한것같아요ㅋㅋㅋ 이건 아니야...ㅠㅠ 로이스 감자칩 드세요
일본에서 파는 로이스 초콜릿칩 엄청 맛있어요!!! 맥주 땡기는, 단짠의 조화!!!!
추석 잘보내셨나요? 좋은 일 있으시던데, 오늘 티비보다가 JTBC2에서 영국남자 1회 재방송하더라구요 올리 아버님오셔서 삼합드시고 청계산 올라가신거 두편 연속 나오더군요 깜짝 놀랐어요 유투브보고 있는줄 알고 순간 착각해네요ㅋㅋ\n성공하셨네요\n축하드려요
단은 자연인같앸ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ손에묻어도 상관없더~~~맛있엉~~~ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ귀여워
영국남자 JTBC2에서 방영하네요 방금보고 깜놀~
이제 방송에서도 보게되었네요? 유튜브서 인기있던 여러개 묶어서 방송될 거래요 ㅋㅋ 조엘 매운 꼬치 나오나요 ㅋㅋㅋ
오늘도 재미잇게 보고가요!\n아참 그리고 조쉬님 jtbc2에 영국남자하던데 \n이제 티비까지타시고..우와 축하드려요
오늘 tv를 봤는데 jtbc에서 영국 남자를 하고있네여!
JTBC2에서 영국남자 하던데 대~~박사건!!!
문득 드는 생각인데 영국남자님도 요즘 한창 핫하게 방송되는 어서와 한국은 처음이지에 고향친구들 데려와서 같이 노는모습 나왔으면 좋겠어요
달고 느끼하다는 느낌이었죠...
더블초코소스도 맛있지만 맥도날드감자튀김은 스위트칠리소스에 찍어먹는게 제일 맛있는듯
단을 보고있다가 생각이 났는데...\n한국의 전통주는 마셔보셨나요?\n마트나 편의점 같은곳에서 파는 소주가 아닌 \n안동소주, 이강주, 면천두견주, 한산소곡주 등등\n맛과 풍미가 가득한 전통주를 마셔보는 영상보고싶어요~^^\n지금까지와 다른 한국의 술맛을 느끼실수 있을겁니다\n아!! 상품화 되어있는거말고 기회가 된다면 직접 찾아가서 맛보는걸로~~~
둘이 의견 바뀌는 거 너무 웃기다ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
영국남자님 전에 삼목초등학교 왔잖아여 저그 초등학교 학생입니다 안녕하세요 ㅎㅎ
저 소스 포장 딸기잼보면 저렇게 되있던데 영국에 없어요??
옛날 불량식품 (화이트 초콜릿 + 초콜릿 ) 작은 숟가락으로 섞어서 먹는 거랑 비슷하네요. /
미친 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ한국어 뭐냐 존나 잘하네여 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 오른쪽 ㅋㅋㅋ
난 왜 조엘이 킹스맨에 남자주인공보다 잘생긴거같지???ㅋ
아 저거 진짜 별로임. 조엘 기분이 공감감. 호기심으로 한번 먹어볼순있어도 계속 먹기엔 사람이 먹을게 아닌거같음.
단, 조쉬랑 조엘이랑 반응이 반대네ㅋㅋ\n\n와플과 감자튀김은 조엘엄청 싫어하더니 치킨너겟은 나쁘지않아 하잖아?ㅋㅋ
단은 진짜 한국인이야 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 겉모습 빼면 완전 토종 한국인ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 발음 왜 이렇게 좋은겨
인기 급상승 동영상 #32 가 되신것을 축하합니다\n Congratulations on your popular rising video # 32.
이거 처음에 먹으면 맛있는데 먹다보면 음.. 좀 느끼해지더라구요
악마의 전염병같은 맛ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋ
이 양반들 이제 하다하다 괴식까지 도전하네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
로이스 초콜릿중에 감자칩에다가 초코 코팅해서 파는거 있어요! 한국 브랜드는 아니지만...
단짠단짠조합이라 괜찮을거라 생각한걸까요 생각만해도 디스커스팅 ㅋㅋ
댄이랑 한국먹방투어 시리즈 끝났나요...????? 그거만기다리고있는데 ㅠㅠ
단:맛좋다 그치? ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 너무 평온하잖아 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Monopoly guy is great but what does that equifax CEO shine his head with?
This video missed the best part. When he wipes his brow with a stack of money.
Wonderful work.
I am so relieved he had a Monocle... I thought for a moment he would fail but HE DID NOT
This is the greatest thing I've ever seen.
How did I do guys?
quality troll
Oh this makes my day.
That monocle though!!!
This is amazing.  \nAnd this man is fucking HERO.
this dude is my spirit animal
When the monocle came out .......dead
That's a woman btw
The hero we need
hello there, fellow redditors
This dude's head is brighter than my future
Plot twist... that's actually a woman in that costume
Seem to be two kinds of people here, those remember him having a monocle and people tha think it is some sort of conspiracy! It is not an effect, you just never played the game!
And a new hero emerges.
This is world class trolling
That person is a Female, get yo facts straight y’all
The fact that the disguise didn't raise any alarms says it all. He fit right in. 😂😂
Thanks for the Free Parking. -_o
This is trending???
Is there a black man behind the monopoly guy?
Hahahahahah this should be #1 on trending that's epic
The monocle puts this over the top.
And another thing we will not honor the flag it was not for black people because it's the same as the Confederate flag. It's just a raggedy piece of material. White people tell us all the time we're not American. So don't expect us to honor the flag with the racist song that go with it
Get that woman a tv show!
now that's how you fucking protest,  take notes people
This is the reason why I want to attend these meetings
fun fact!!!!\n*the monopoly guy doesn't wear a monocle*\n👀
if this is considered trolling then the women's march was a successful protest
i didn't not know wade wilson was here.
Thumbnail looks like a bald Ryan Reynolds
Modern Breaches, a why to say we sold your information to the highest bidder.
And YOU must be the Monopoly guy...thanks for the free parking.
But what if they hired her to distract you from the real issue??
Jews control America's Federal Reserve and foreign policy.
Just because they wear a top hat and cardboard mustache and wipe their brow with fake money doesn't mean they are trolling... 😃\nEveryone, please watch my little nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
I wish for a interruption. But anyway nice job !
Hilarious and original!! Love it.
He's practicing for Halloween x)
I have never laughed so hard at something in my life before. Hahaha, well done good sir. Well done.
This is how Trump got elected people dont know how to do their jobs and screen and check peoples identity properly hes probably a russian spy
It’s not just the freeze part.
These guys sell all their shares prior to making their WE BEEN HACKED announcement and yet no charges for fraud? This infuriates me.
Apparently the Mandela Effect suggests the Monopoly guy NEVER wore a monocle? What do YOU remember?
Baby heartbeat listener Tracker- Heartbeat monitors application has the particular fun and nonmedical objective. \nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appgametechnologies.baby_heart_rate_monitor_listener&hl=en
He had a monocle in a different reality I'm 100% sure its the Mandela effect in action.
I guess everyone's doing a side show now too
Now this... this is nice.
Crazy part is thats no troll. Thats actually Sam Walton founder of Walmart reinvigorated and given a new body to live out immortality.
Best laughs I have in weeks :'D
This is why I joined the internet.
Wait the monopoly guy never had a monocle though
It’s funny that this will be trending and plenty of people will write comments here but how many of you will actually call or write your representatives to protect your life and livelihood?\n\nTake 30 seconds to contact them: \nCopy and paste:\nPlease federally limit personal and small business liability for fraudulently used identifying information and replace the social security number system.\n\nThen sign it and mail it your representatives.\n\nAlternatively google your state for your senator/house representative and call them at the number on their website to say the same as the above message.\n\nIf legislation is properly implemented this could literally save your life, your child’s college saving, your family’s lives or your local small business for an investment of 30 seconds today.\n\n(Flagrantviolations.com)
This is the best thing ever
so funny I forgot to laugh
After many days I found a quality video
I looooove him. Thank you dude!
Oh and by the way black people. Notice how for 50 years they've been telling us where 13% of the population think about it they've been telling us that for 50-60 years don't you think we have grown by now
Thats really funny
Mr pennybags doesn't wear a monocle
lmao
Lmao

That guy’s head is brighter than my future...
Hey YouTube black people will not be silent. You will not shut us up. We are God's chosen people from negroland no such thing as a white Jesus. Black people don't support banana Republic they want to try to tell people black people what to do with their hair

A R C H Y L I F E
Fuck yeah this is good!
Pre-ordered the album so I woke up happily surprised to find this beautiful track on my phone and if that wasn't enough I also get to watch this beautiful video and  marvel at his beautiful aura. Good day today.
God damn dude I need to see this kid live
King Krule is so refreshing and inspiring. Excited to see such a young talent continue to create great music. Looking forward to see what he does in the future.
It's the secret verse from Out Getting Ribs!!! <3
all i think of is sharkboy and lavagirl
I am so happy with the direction he's taking his music
I'm waiting for Cosmo .........
this is an absolute banger

This song is so beyond King Krule's years. (That's a compliment.)

SHIT i LOVE HIM AND EVERYTHING HE RELEASES!?
You might enjoy Münechild on my channel if you dig the King!
He sings the last verse of this song at the end of a live version of borderline from like 4 years ago. \nHow cool is that?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0RFCQEZL4M

Big rule fan I always loved his eccentricity but I can't pretend everything he does is good anymore...
How he sings BROTHER BROTHER. Oh my......I'm in love!
Didn't really like the song much until 3:38, would've liked a whole song based on that idea.
Waiting for that vinyl patiently

See you Ocotber 28th Krule!!

JUSTICE FOR GINGERS......

Eh... stop.

Ik zou het egt heel nice vinden als ik ze mocht hebben, zo ja, @h.vdpost@hotmail.com is mn e-mail en anders snap ik het zeker als ik ze niet krijg want er zijn ook anderen die kans maken op deze schoenen van de beste voetballer die leeft. Succes iedereen en altijd blijft dese strijder in mijn hard, Nouri. #prayfornouri
how can jim carrey think anyone else is bad when he knowingly gave a woman herpes and then abandoned her while she killed herself
Jim has lost his mind.
this was a great interview. This was not scripted or rehearsed like most interviews Jim gets. Some parts were a bit uncomfortable but Jim Carrey is awesome. He went through some shit and I think he's dealing with it in his own way.
These guys are just shooting the shit and having a great time. That Psycho story is hilarious.
He's fucking annoying... and now is into some pretentious I am not a person bullshit? No wonder he isn't in movies anymore, no one can stand him.
Jim was fucking awesome in this interview. I also thought cable guy was his best movie so that tells you what kinda person I am.
37:16 wow its so weird to see michael cera look awkward. He is usually so comfortable and chill
Excellent!!! Makes you feel like you're in the room with them.  So good to hear no censorship.  GO CANADIANS!!!  Hehe... :-)
No wonder studios want nothing to do with him.
I cant believe how much of a fuckwit jim carrey is
idk, i wish there wasnt a whole production team
Jim Carrey looks more human and real than I've seen him, probably ever. Great to see him on the show
26 minutes is amazing. Nrom mis-references Cheers, actually talking about Night Court. Then Jim makes a Cheers reference, getting confused when he feels the reference doesn't fit. amazing.
Jim is awesome and I don’t care what you assholes say
37:18 Michael Cera getting the shout out! Probably shit his pants god bless!! :)
These laughs cover-up the sound of people walking on egg shells.. Love the man formally know as Jim Carrey and what he's doing (?) now.. *But* he *can* steamroll the shit outta people in interviews..  STOP INTERRUPTING ME lol, or  do as I say not as I do.. But that has to do with self awareness- And, well, I really can't hold that against someone who isn't there.
Jim is ADD, high, or both
damn, norm out did Jim big time
jim carrey seems extremely mentally ill in this interview.
46:27\n is what ive been saying for awhile !!!\nstfu norm your hilarious but we want to hear jim ! not your dum little add on jokes you mentally challenged old person.
So, because you're afforded this luxury of not having to work, does it give you more time to think up these crazy fucking batshit ideas?  Norm, you're the king. Ah, that was good.
small minded people aren't willing to open their minds.
What does Jim Carey want to be called if he doesn't exist anymore??
Has no one seen any jim carrey interviews? He has never been normal. People are just soo sensitive now and cant handle it.
Is it coincidence that they riff on Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas impressions and then mention Frank Gorshin? Because Gorshin does a Burt+Kirk Batman and Robin routine in this 1966 clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FYK4wTceAA
Hey Norm cameos as a space blob on The Orville the Start Trek comic knock off. He plays a real jerk too.
27:42 theres a career but no me  that tiny moment in that exact second moves me
These two had the greatest SNL skit if all time .. celebrity's jeporady burnt Reynolds.... Norm killed it as always..
Love that upside ad. 6 star treatment!? That's one more than 5! And their employees aren't employees but navigators. That's so disarming. I'm totally disarmed. As a person from the 50s I think these ideas are amazing!
IT WOULD BE FUNNIER IF THE HOST WAS FUNNY....THIS WHITE GUY SUCKS NORM WHO D FUCK GIVES A SHIT
I was ... I say was , a fan because I found Jim Carey hysterical. He's my all time favorite actor,comedian. But this is awful. I'm a bit uncomfortable watching it. Perplexed as to those ramblings he is on now, trying detachment methods to rid himself of the old Jim. That's what he is doing here and of late  Depression is here. I just don't like him this way. Its too much. He is too much. On set ''over actor.''.as she says in Liar Liar bloopers clip. How do ya like my hair.   Whatever takes the focus off your head.!
There is no self and The natural state is to be depressed... So he's depressed, and not the type to want help or advice. Good thing Norm gets in a remark at the end.
I havent watched it yet, but I can't stand pretentious intellectuals who've read one philosophy book and go around with this holier-than-thou attitude. \nThey lecture everyone about anything and usually there is something wrong with them that's actually incredibly simple, ie, lack of friends, no girlfriend, resentment, jealousy, low self-esteem, sense of failure (even if they're successful), etc. \nI don't know what it is about men, but I know a lot of guys who go off on this incredibly dark path. It starts off with abstractions and philosophy and then turns into full-blown I talked to God last night. Christian Bale is my brother-type shit.\n I think maybe lonliness. \nThis is my pre-view judgment, maybe the interview will change my mind. Hopefully, Im wrong.
I love both Norm and Jim.  Both great human beings.  :)
I don't need approval of anybody. 10,000 dollars to see his stupid paintings
This whole thing he's doing lately is just a smart move to make himself relevant, right?
Oh man. I'd love to have Jim Carrey over one late Friday evening with a couple of beers just laughing our asses off. :D
More annoying than funny. He's got a shake to him, and seems a bit ill
What’s the name of the coffee?
The inability to listen is deafening for the soul.
Damn A list guests. Is norm becoming a Scientologist? 🤔🤔
These will be looked back on as.....
i miss the old jim!
Sad to see Jim Carrey like this, if you've ever been around mental breakdown you will recognise his ramblings as a coping mechanism. I hope he can find peace.
1:08:52  no me?  what then, clone?  (not just 'actor's method')
Jim Carrey is quite pretentious for one who claims to have no ego
If you could get Mr.Nobody to post his Bulletproof coffee recipe kind sir, that would be great.
Chris Kattan and Richard Lewis at the same time.
There must be a thousand ideas going through Carrey's mind every minute. Very talented.
Add Eric Andre to the list.
Jim is not a good listener.
Jim is being a ball hog and he keeps blocking all of Norm's shots. Norm does the same thing back and the interview gets frustrating.
I too cannot sanction this man's buffoonery. Weed is not everyone's friend.
What the fuck is everybody complaining about? This was fuckin great!
there's something wrong with Jim Carrey.
What was really in that coffee? Jimmy Savile joke really..... That's funny. That's sick.
His comment on Richard Pryor was a little too brute. There was a context sure but not feeling he is enlightened. Just maybe awake to the egos inner workings.
Goddamn Norm! Let Your Guests Talk...Nobody Cares What You Have To Say!!!!
Oh wow, W.O.W!! I loved this interview so much!! Thank you Norm, great job on this one
seriously, stick a piece of folded paper under the table if you can't afford a stable desk.
Jim Carrey is to comedy what Drew Carey is to comedy.\n\nNever liked Jim Carrey or anything he did but this was great. Something about Norm's table makes anyone watchable.
fuckin asshole says I don't need you people, meanwhile tries desperately every 15 secs to make audience laugh... seems to lose it if they don't.
i have to say, the frequency in jim carrey isn't right somehow. you can be have your head in the clouds but you still need your feet on the ground. i think a guy like russell brand is more balanced example. jim is off the reservation- the lights are on but no ones home anymore.
29:23 piece of the cup defies physics and bounces up off the wall like a projectile
That's 20min of my life I won't get back.  I need to get my shit together.
Norm didn’t know how to handle a Jim Carrey interview...he kept interrupting any of Jims stories.  It was a very ADD interview all around...he was taking Jims “I’m not really me schtick” a little too literal... which in turn made Jim push it even more making it kind of uncomfortable.  I have to say though it was still great Jim and Norm both had me laughing so hard multiple different times!!!
I've always taken them for granite. I'll be upset for a long time that that joke delivery got interrupted by the producers
I know that in the scriptures it says judge not lest the be judged but I'm just gonna say it, this Jim Carrey fellow sounds like a real jerk!
Norm does better when his guest or counter person can't be easily upstaged and so that the audience isn't offended if he cuts them off. Makes this match up perfect.
great stuff
LOL!
Like :)

Jim Carrey is fucking hilarious.

Norm is amazing......Jim is a liberal ass hat
Always down for a Norman Wexler story.
I really hate people who try to push their conspiracy shit on you.
Jim Carrey has been reduced to a simmer. Sad.
Instead of them introducing Uncle Benjin during this time and having a reunion with Jon, they decided to spend thousands if not millions on a stupid ass polar bear. They could have sent Benjin to the wall to get Davos to send ravens instead of having gendry run 30 miles an hour to get there.
This scene was unnecessary, why didn't you use it to build up Benjins return instead? The writers of this season was stupid as shit, people didn't start liking GOT because of the crazy action but because of the characters, and although action is awesome, it gets tasteless if you don't have a good plot line to follow it. Please get good again in the last season thanks
Dear Game of Thrones: FYI, for S8 we would rather have the direwolves over war elephants from Essos... Sincerely, The Fans\nP.S. No one wanted a fooking polar bear when we could have had scenes with Ghost!
Quit bragging about something that is literally the biggest waste of time and resources in the entire show. I still liked this season, but it's no secret the writing has taken a nosedive recently, and when keep seeing you guys talking about your zombie polar bear you had to work so hard as a team to get in, it makes me realize just how much worse at writing compelling entertainment the Davids are than George.
Of all the things in season seven, this bullshit is what pissed me off the most (besides Littlefinger and the Jonerys buffoonery) This story is supposed to be about people. It's supposed to be about treachery and relationships and the complexity of human nature. It's not spending millions of dollars on a fucking zombie polar bear. D&D are completely stupid and I'm starting to wonder if they read the first two books, got bored, and then just read spark notes to get them through the rest. They care more about their friendships with the actors than the dialogue the actors speak (bad pussy, dickon jokes, Tyrion and little finger's entire script) they're more about shock value than cohesive plots and actions for the characters that make sense (Jon giving up the north even though Dany had already consented to fight with his people and Arya wanting to kill Sansa) and most obviously, they care more about big action set pieces and pointless dragon/ polar bear scenes than Jon being with the direwolf that represents his connection with his REAL family, the Starks (because Ghost being with him at Dragonstone would remind him of the family that we literally see him ignore except to write *once* in the months he spends on the island). This is really long and congrats of you got to the end but in conclusion: D&D can go fuck themselves. We don't need these fuckers in charge.
I appreciate the bear but would have preferred Ghost . Atleast once in the season.
Why the fuck is a zombie polar bear cool again??? \n\nD&D are fucking idiots.
If somebody ever asks me what's so bad about being mainstream, I will point them to this fucking polar bear.
they are such a good actors
*God dammit we want a zombie polar bear*
i prefer ghost over this unnecessary wight bear scene
Just saw the 14 minute version of this...simply amazing 😊👍
I'm glad we got this polar bear that nobody remembered or talked about after the episode was over. I mean, we had to trade off ghost, a super important character to the story that carries loads of symbolism, so we didn't have him during the uniting of the two biggest characters of the entire show, no matter what kind of symbolism could have been carried through him, but it was all worth it in the end for this epic polar bear. The one that nobody remembers. The one that had no narrative purpose whatsoever.
Its a real shame the show seems to be giving in to what the fans want e.g 70% action episodes. It may be what people want but what they want may not necessarily be good for the show. The drawn out discipline and diplomacy of season 6, skipping out what could have been massive action scenes (such as Stannis at Winterfell) lead to the final 2 episodes being the biggest pay offs in TV history for many viewers. I feel game of thrones is just been rushed now, like this zombie polar bear contributed nothing to the plot. No one important died from it, it didn't lead to anything they just killed it and moved on. It was just action for the sake of action. Smart, thought out intelligent screen writing with good pay offs and twists made game of thrones great. Not pointless action like in the walking dead.
... sigh
This is why we didn't see ghost. They spent all the budget on Toby the bear.
Hey Guys! This Is Brilliant! I Got 𝔽𝕣𝕖𝕖 𝕏𝔹𝕆𝕏 $𝟝𝟘𝟘 𝕡𝕣𝕠𝕞𝕠 𝕔𝕠𝕕𝕖𝕤 Here – >  #Topfreegiftcardsin2017now
Why Polar bear? Where is the spiders big as hounds. Disappointment!
Hit the play button, fluffed my pillow behind my back, sat back to watch the Zombie Polar Bear - video already finished.\nThanks fooking Game Revealed!
Not gonna lie... the thumbnail of the zombie polar bear shit looks like Rap Monster😂👀
Youre not a bear, your name is Toby
This reminds me of Ralph the movie maker
FUCK THE ZOMBIE POLAR BEAR!!! THE CGI MONEY COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO BRING BACK GHOST!!!! I WANT GHOST!!!!
Loved that scene, it was epic 😱
I didn't even know the bear was a zombie until right now, thought it was just a strange Westeros beast (which anyway it was) now I don't know if I should feel dumb or if I should just blame the directing because this episode must be the most unfocused of the series (like with the bunch of characters dying that weren't even shown before their deaths)
Can someone address why Kit always has white gunk in his hair in those interview scenes? lol
Your name is Toby ! :)
can't believe Thoros died for this shit
I don't think any of you really like Ghost, you are only here to use him to feel cool and accepted on the internet. No offense to people who really do like him
honestly such a waste of budget
No more shirts and trousers and jackets? RLY?!\nThank You! Thank You from the bottom of my heart!
What do you people want Ghost to do? I wants Ghost for what? Just to walk around? Only few episodes left I rather see the main struggle and such than a diré wolf. Wait for rr to write about Ghost.
I guess they dont film everything on location
Guys, the zombie polar bear wasn't just for the theatrics, it was to give a hint to the audience that animals too can be turned into wights, foreshadowing what happened with Viserion.
Smh guess I'll watch the episode again!
Any one else think that in season 8, bran is going to tell Jon about how the night king was created and Jon is going to order them to  make him into one in order to stop the NK. Jon will do anything to stop the night king, and if that means giving up his life to save his family and westeros, he'll do it. I don't know what will happen to daenerys but she's for sure going to die some way.
Twd should do something like this a zombie animal
all that effort for something so fucking unnessary
Should have used the money on writing!
this scene was so confusing to watch honestly I couldn't really follow it the first time I saw the episode I didn't know what was going on
Why are these mini documentaries behind a paywall?? Just upload it to YouTube for fucks sake.
Game of thrones is fucking gay
I think that title needs more grammatical errors
That's right. I stabbed it on the head while it's on fire
And, yet, it would get the shit kicked out of it by a zombie gorilla
It was the blurst of times.
Head too welove_gameofthrones on Instagram to receive funny memes and theories on game of thrones and it's upcoming season 8 🐺🔥❄️
Thoros Of Myr died for a stupid Polar Bear -.-
This bullshit sums up the terrible transformation this show has undergone. I first fell in love with this show not because of pointless spectacular cgi like this, that was basically nonexistent in season 1. I fell in love with the incredibly rich and complex story, the likes of which i had never seen before. Now the story is pretty simple and straightforward, and terribly predictable, and instead of putting effort into the story, the very soul and heart of every show/book/movie, they give us pointless shit lile this.
literally nobody gave a shit about the zombie polar bear and you guys are still trying to hype it up... waste of budget :(
DnD just seem like idiots, mostly all the fanbase want ghost to have a more prominent role but no, ZOMBIE POLAR BEAR COS WERE IDIOTS WHO LIKE SEEING SPLOSIONS AND FOIRE
They wasted an episode worth of money on a fucking bear.
What a fucking shitty scene that nobody wanted.
It was pretty weird, to be honest. -Rory McCann and many GoT fans
Common sense: Why don't you do Ice Spiders as big as hounds? The things that have had multiple mentions throughout the show.\n\nD&D: Nah, just do a random fucking polar bear.
so the polar bear was idubbbz
That polar bear is taking revenge for REVENANT
bear was unnecessary, Where's Ghost? :K
Funny how much they hype this bear but nobody watching really gave a shit
GoT was my favourite show ever and this season ruined it. Thanks to the lazy writing, plot holes and general stupidity and carelessness of DnD. Ruining something so good takes a special kind of stupidity. And you guys proved to have it in spades.
Behind the scenes on how to waste budget
i was very disappointed with this season, i was hoping that the 7th season was going to be the season we were finally going to see Arya in a very graphic sex scene, and seeing her coming across all those Lannister soldiers thought that, that might of been the moment where it was going to happen.
Damn if only all the effort that went into animating the CGI bear went into the actual writing.....
A zombie polar bear? How is this related to, let's say, dragons and all that from ancient history?
as soon as they deviated from the novel I instantly lost all interest
So they swapped Ghost for a\n\n\nMotherfucking corpse of a polar bear?
These scene was very memorable, because that bear was truly terrifying! Cheers HBO one of my favorite moments of Season 7!
Dont get me wrong, i love GoT. But how the fuck is a video with 100k views and 3.5k likes is on trending again?
I really enjoyed season 7 overall, but a zombie polar bear sounds a lot more interesting on paper than it actually is to watch. By far the biggest moment of man, what happened to this show? I experienced in any of the seven episodes.
that polar bear scene was a waste of money and time in my opinion

People are seriously upset with this? Geez, there's no pleasing anyone these days
Any critics of Game of Thrones now; I suggest you go write something 10+Million people are watching , stealing to watch, buying series of the books, making multiple You Tube channels on the topics of the HBO series just about what you write. TRY IT ! I bloody bet nothing you sprawl out will equal half of the people Loving or even just mildly curious how its all going to turn out that watch Game of Thrones . Game of Thrones is not what it once was but it is not a regular t.v. series ....it has to come to an ending ; Game of Thrones has broken t.v. history records . The series is Lovingly and excitedly talked about on talk shows.... even when the series is off season and no one from Game of Thrones is scheduled to be on their talk shows. It wasn't up for any EMMY'S this year due to timing of Game of Thrones being later in the year as usual ; the series was given a Thank You by Stephen for giving other t.v. series a chance and as well as the series being mentioned in the beginning of the EMMY'S song introduction it was mentioned a few more times in praise . The nay sayers of Game of Thrones have no sense of imagination to be taken on someone elses journey and not their own ;they want what they like and anything different is off setting ....Game of Thrones is not their journey of story telling and imagination.  They have their own and one day maybe they will write it .
I've never seen this show in my life, is it good?
You guys whine more than 13 year old girls
Billie Jean?\n\nNot my lover.\n\nDEAD
Wow this is the best sketch I've seen in a very long time. Hilarious. Thanks Tim.
Ya know I think we've all learned something from this \n\n\n\n\n\n*WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE*
bloody great!
I surgically removed my ex's eyes so I could see what she was up to. We've all been there
0:48 That reminds me of one of Tim's really old vlogs in which he says I'm so confident in my sexuality I could fuck a guy and it wouldn't be gay
So many genuine laughs from this. Good on you, very hard to do these days.
Watching this for the forth time now 😂
We tried to go on a family holiday but we were stopped in the airport. Now I know why.\nI’m sorry for how things ended, Tim.
Jack once again playing the only voice of reason in the world
Yeah we've all been there. Except for the submarines. I haven't done that yet.
What a brilliant video to bring out since the last one a few months ago, absolutely hilarious
Three of my favorite youtube people. this was  brill♥
For a second, i thought the vet was the actress from wynonna earp. They look so alike!
This is what I come to YouTube for, snappy, witty sketch comedy. Bravo!
holy fuck i have the biggest crush on tim
I love how somehow it's always Jack that ends up being exasperated with his friends' ridiculousness, whether it be Dean or Tim and Dom lol
Itd be cool if tim liked this comment
I AM DYING THIS IS AMAZING
the acting and comedic timing was spot on in this!
My oh my I love this one! Well done.
A helicopter, tranq dart, and a seventeen-hectare corn maze filled with scorpions. Yeah, we've all been there.
Quality work as always
Been so long, Tim!! :) good causal acting
There we've all been
billy jean, not my lover\nfucking brilliant
Watching this video? We've all been there
Hello Tom. *cocks head* \nI fully expected you all to accuse Jack of having sent his ex a Howler when he mentioned a letter.
Little bit too long and repetitive for a weak punchline
Clever as always. I laughed so hard.
HOW DO YOU EVEN COME UP WITH THIS I HAVENT STOPPED LAUGHING FOR HOURS
i mean i've surely been there. everytime i break up with one of my boyfriends i make sure to hex him and then section him off from his family and slowly start causing disasters between him and everyone he loves.\n\n\nwe've all been there.
Oh god that Billie Jean joke x'D
this is bloody brilliant oh my gosh
Finally! A video. Still great. We've all been there.
Aaahh I miss this content! had a smile on my face through out the entire video! :D
pls dont steal my little brother, man. no matter how relateable the urge is....
Dom Fera omg I totally forgot about him. What a contributor to classic YouTube. Glad you're still alive, man. 😅
I snort-laughed on the bus...
I was thinking about you the other day this can't be a coincidence right
Corn maze? Was that a throw-back? :o
I agree, I mean, I cursed my ex, and now his house has burnt down and his otter is dead - Kathleen Raine 1968 (commenting on her ex Gavin Maxwell who turned out to be gay...)
What’s better than this? Guys bein doods
wanted to know what was going on in my ex's life so i figured it was just easier to kill him and become him
this is very good
i liked the spitted WHATHG at the end good touch
Take a shot every time they say we've all been there.
*gets notification* do my eyes deceive me it can't be I'm not ready
So happy that he posted another great sketch
Jack neglected to mention the anthrax he dusted that letter with.
Literary uploaded at the exact time when my gf of 6years left me
This is me compared to all of my friends\n\nI'm Jack
ASADAFADF THANK YOU FOR THIS
I mean to be fair I did get all of his siblings to like me more than they like him, BUT WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE
Amber?\nSurgically removed her hands and now they're mine\nMe: well fuck...
Trying to come up with a witty funny comment to show you guys how much I love this, but I can't think of anything... but I guess we've all been there.
did you get a bunch of bats?
HAHA THIS IS GREAT! I love it!
*W E ‘ V E    A L L     B E E N    T H E R E .*
Tim's back for real? Yess
I think I'm now too used to the old school UK youtube comedy sketch formula. I found myself counting down to each punchline. Appreciate the water drop though, good call back to the old days :)
I hate beer but it's very satisfying to see them drinking a good ol' Belgian Hoegaarden. \nThis was fucking hilarious tho.
Really a letter to tell her how you feel?\nWhy didn't you send her a letter bomb or I don't know send her a paket of high quality kokain and give the police a tip.\nYou know something a sane person would do you sicko.
Hi, I'm new here! YouTube suggestions is killing it! This is funny!!!! 👏👏👏
this was so well written lmao
YAY! Every time you upload you consistently raise the bar and never disappoint and your honestly one of the best creators I've ever had the pleasure to come across
Oh man, this is brilliant 😂 Hilariously funny. Where do you even get these ideas from!?
Rip to all of Tim's future ex-girlfriends

That beer is awful clear
Is LaVar Ball the worst sports parent ever?
6:08 - this chick just ask is lamelo okay with this?\nbruh, Lavar is his dad. Melo doesn't have to be okay with it but his trash ass has to accept that that parents have the last say lol stay in yo lane.
Wish I wasn't white
Lavar Ball is the G.O.A.T when it comes to sports dads.
When will Molly learn to let people talk and not speak over them? She does it all the time and it drives me absolutely crazy.
A beautiful wife he's been with for over 30 years two sons who are committed to UCLA and that are top recruits in the nation one son in the NBA all three of them won a state championship together Lonzo got his own Brand Lavar started I really wouldn't call that a bad parent
One would really have to question why that hatchet job of an article was even written by USA today. It's clear to me that someone is trying to put a target on this man's back.
Idk how yall feel, but i really like will cain on this show lol almost like the skip of the modern era.
So how is lavar the worst sport parent ever when lebrons Dad and other athletes parents weren’t even there growing up?
They cant say it so i will fuk that reporter and their opinion...done
He's not a bad dad, just an ANNOYING person.  Those are two different things.\nLavar is a legit dad... I just wouldn't hang out with him personally, lol.
Nancy better stay in her lane
LaVar a fool 😂, but no he’s done a lot for his family since they were kids let’s take a look. One is in the NBA already, Another one about to play for UCLA, the last one gots his own signature shoe!
Jealousy is apparent here and I would like to see these pundits children so we can compare and contrast.  Lavar is black and that's the problem period, non of the other stuff...ESPN reaching...Even Liberal whites secretly hate black people and wish for their demise...In a world gone mad are we really judging Lavar for being an outspoken parent and involved....Even liberal whites still want black men to check in with white authority before making a decision. Black men are not allowed to think independently, that's the real problem
The worst sports parents are the ones that chose not to be in their kids’ lives
One of your kids is an NBA PLAYER and you called the team that picked him. This man is the 🐐 leave him alone
he is the best parent imo
Nobody gives a fuck about your input Molly. Just wear something skimpy and shut the fuck up.
There should be a drone shot of Molly front and rear while the guys talk
This chick molly can never get a word in 😂😂
Fuck lavar ball. He ruins the image of basketball. His annoying ass just wants publicity. He's an egomaniac.
fuck nancy a woman cant say shit about a father
Worst sports parents that keep saying his son will never be good or things like that.
Let’s see hmmmm ....\n\n#1 Married to the same woman\n#2 All kids by the same woman\n#3 One son in the NBA and is a multi millionaire \n#4 One son attending UCLA\n#5 One son rank #7 best high school basketball player in America \n#6. None of his sons have a mug shot.\n#7. Started his own shoe and merchandise company \n#8 MAJOR AMERICAN ARTICLE NAMES THIS MAN THE WORST SPORTS PARENT IN HISTORY\n\nThey said the same thing about Venus and Serena Williams' dad and Tiger Woods' dad.... Do you see a pattern❓🤔 \n\n***
She's spot on.
NANCY NEEDS TO STAY IN HER LANE
Is it just me.. when this will cain guy starts to speak. I immediately turn this crap off..
Why does will Cain have a job
I don’t even think he’s obnoxious. I just think he’s a professional troll and knows how to take advantage of the media with his antics.
Wow just don't talk about LiAngelo
This is such BS. The kid is being home schooled for his last two years of high school. SO FUCKING WHAT? there are so many kids home schooled especially famous kids who go to school and it becomes a distraction because they are so famous. Y’all act like he’s not fuckin rich and they can get the best tutors and so on. People so busy worried about the wrong thing when they kids ain’t shit.. BBB
Well, it's funny limited resources but make it is classic white folk tales as they are extremely strict in the South especially if your a QB but whatever. Lavar is a marketing genius period!
I don’t hear these people complaining about the 1000’s of kids pulled from school to work in Hollywood etc. the problem is LaVar is a minority who happens to be outspoken, conservative, opinionated etc. hypocrites
Fuck them I wish lavar ball was my pops
LeMelo doesn't have a high basketball IQ compared to his brother. I don't think he will make it in NBA in the future. He just chucks bad threes and is awful on defense... It's probably best for him to be home schooled though considering how famous he is now.
lavar can do what he wants, its HIS kids ffs. wat business is it of the liberal sports media?
Russell Westbrook - I'll Be Champion Soon\nhttps://youtu.be/7HjB3xPjN60

She better stay in her lane.
Him being there for his children automatically disqualifies what the fuck she's saying. There's plenty of deadbeat niggas who don't even know their child's name.
Molly u dumb bitch stfu with nobody gives a shit bout ur stupid point
Lamello is a celebrity now. He can't be at a regular high school. It's that simple. Too many distractions
Why are they talking about someone who isn’t even in the nba yet 😂 calm down and talk about actual professional sports players in the nba or nfl
Molly please stay in yo lane... And I aint apologizing like Cam Newton!
Whats wrong with creating your own brand? Should he have some other company exploit his son...i say marketing at it's finest
Max's hair got it's color back.
Why would First Take give this article so much TV exposure? Lavar is a genius and he know the new coach is on some BS. When you tell my son you want be shooting 50 times, instead of saying we going to have more ball movement and assist a game.
Ban will cain from first take
BULLSHIT....Lavar is a great Father look at the results
Imagine LaMelo attending Chino Hills H.S... rolling up in his red Ferrari... music blaring... television camera distracting the other students from properly graphing a parabola in Algebra 2 class? Not to mention the envy and jealousy of the other boys as he (Melo) attends prom with 300 gold digging vixens... This could all lead to some serious issue ESPN and Sports Illustrated dim wits. Now, go THINK ABOUT IT!
Molly needs to shut the fuck up and stop trying to insert herself into the conversation. Nobody cares what she has to say
School really isn’t that important
Hmm lets go to ESPN for parenting advice... said no one ever.
the worse or perfect? I swear we can never win... If were unsuccessful its because we have no dad , we have a dad & now hes the worst...smh
Get off Lavar dick and let yo bitch get on it
“A lot of people would kill to have a father” -whatever the female hosts name is
i want to hear Kristine Leahy's comments on this. I havent heard anythign from her since she got put in her lane
Why Molly always feel like she has to yell her way in? 😂😂
Stephen A. Knows it all
I'm on that big baller shit forreal
Lavar Ball is the greatest sports parent
LeBron James had no dad I would put his dad on that list Ball is fucking the game up and yt ppl are pissed
I'm pretty sure Julian Newman's father is a lot worse...
Worst sports parent ever? Sounds like a bunch of ignorant jealous people voted this.
Who the fuck is the washed up bitch who made that statement anyway. No one cares about her.
This probably coming from people who have no fathers
Lavar is doing fine with his whole family!!! I can give you a much better example of parents who screwed up their kid. Tiger woods parents! No normal kid grows up on a golf green. And at the end Tiger messed up his marriage and career.
If you guys watch their reality show called Ball in the Family, you'll see that lavar is the best father and husband you could possibly have
that is so STUPID to pull him out of high school, you should be learning at home to anyway
Lol half of all these black athletes had father's who ran away... I might not like his antics but to have those 3 kids who are as good as they are takes real parenting.
They want to build him up to break him down
Molly really needs to keep her mouth shut...always interrupting...she needs to follow Joy Taylor's example and only comment at the end of the segment....no one cares about her opinion...she is simply eye candy
The only thing i can say about lavar is that good or bad  i would be ashamed if he was my father
Why do people care how LaVar raises his kids SMDH worry about your own life
MOLLY SHUT UP!!! Please bring back Cari Champion 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
The real problem is hes breaking all the traditions and restraints.... No shoe deal create your own.. Stream lining from a unknown highschool to a major college ..and now homeschooling and personal training instead of highschool ball
1) Not gonna lie the optics of crying about 2 coaches in a row, to the point of pulling the kid not only from the team but from SCHOOL...\nDoes seem a bit much\n\nDoesn't = worst ever but being 'real' it is a bit over the top, to yank the kid outta SCHOOL a month in...\nThe basketball team...ain't biology and math class\nI got ZERO problem if dude say my boy is done with THIS coach and thus squad BUT in all fairness and no offense to LaVar but how you all of a sudden 'qualified' to home school the boy, dawg 😂\n\nI mean, what's wrong letting the boy GO TO CLASS...Pops?\nPick him up at 3 o'clock and train... \nIf class time and homework wasn't getting in his way or Lonzo's way...why pull him from 2 years of school...\n\nI'd have LESS issue had they came back from the summer and said dude is just going train and forget about school altogether but to be REACTIVE about totally pulling him out of school over just the basketball coach is bush league overall as a REACTION, sorry that's child-like.\n\nHim and his wife NEVER home-schooled the first 2...why 'experiment' on the LAST kid's LAST 2 years of h/s over the b-ball coach....that's my issue\n\nDude could absolutely go the school and not PLAY for Chino High...whatever class time and homework time wasn't an issue before and hadn't been one for the first two so let's not go there and nobody's saying SCHOOL was in the way so x-ing out ALL school/educational development = unnecessary\n\nWhy all of a sudden, he needs what now all day training...No that over-reacting \nThe kid 'could' have been a 'student' at Chino AND trained privately for b-ball = not a problem\nBut pulling from chemistry, social studies and English class over THIS ish one month into Jr. year is (no offense) is chick-like, little crying girl-like to be 'real' with you.\nCertain decisions you map out properly, especially when it's your kid's actual childhood, they only get ONE...as an adult you can muck around for 2-3 years and say, man I messed that up, shoulda done this way I'ma change it up NEXT year but kids only get 1 Junior year, one shot at being 16 in high school dawg...why be flippant and take it away from the kid over a hissy with a coach, \nWhy ROB him of ALL his teachers and the possible good influences THEY may have been on him?\n\nReal talk, I had some cool teachers in h/s that I quote to THIS day, that were way, away from the court, the field or any squad I played on...my parents were great, coaches were cool but the texture one can get from 'learning' and being around other adults during one's formatives years can be invaluable\nI'm thinking of a couple cool as teachers right now from 30 years ago that I'm glad I got to know cause they helped round out my experience, being at HOME with Moms N Pops especially STARTING all of a sudden at the END of schooling seems like giving up, throwing in the towel\n\nLaMelo's two older brothers got 'better' than that\n\nIf THIS is the 'best' way...Why NOW... how come the first two didn't go this no school route\n\nNah dude, you mad ( which is cool) but you don't arbitrarily pull the boy out of structured schooling over THIS issue, \nTransfer him = ok\nBut to say my man is OUT of school, when you and Moms had obviously planned to leave the educating to the school system ( like you had been doing and did in allowing the educational system to make the other 2 academically qualified for UCLA) why 'play' with my man's educational preparedness, off the whim?\nThat's silly\n\nIf it was he's not playing this year and just training and then skipped Senior that be another thing because one could see and understand the planning...this ish right here is just getting mad and kicking rocks in a hissy fit...that isn't foresight, that running away like a girl, hastily\nYou don't 'play' with kid's childhood off momentary 'feelings'... handle the ball playing how you want but in fairness, dude should have left the schooling in place...he never said the school wasn't doing it's job educationally, again the first two had no issues qualifying for UCLA why rock the academic ⛵, the kid's social ⛵ over obviously the non important basketball squad?
So whatever happened to education first?
Typical & not surprising at all. The corporate mafia doesn't control him nor his son's career, so what do they do? Get a lame writer to put a hit piece out on him.
5:48 shut up Molly. Men are talking. 😂😂
Who's the fuck is she lol
Lavar Ball is the epitome of how a father should be. How many black fathers you see pushing their kids like he is? He's out their supporting them, going to their games, trying to tell the world that they have potential. What more can a parent do? Sure he says obnoxious things at times when he says stuff like beating Jordan one on one. But all in all I see a man who believes in his kids potential and is doing everything he can to get them where he wants as a parent. Dude is a genius and knows what he's doing and people are going for it. If more fathers did this, it would be amazing. It said you don't see it. But when you do, people are quick to say the wrong things about a man who's just trying to be different.
molly shut the fuck up
Nice to see this comment section is full of race baiting.
I like Will Cain he's like a Fun Dork with savy wordplay almost Skip Bayless to a degree He's enjoyable no homo ya dig
You guys are stupid.... This MAN rise his kids the right way, NO DRINKING OR SMOKING. 2 kids that went to college and this Melo NOT Stopping SCHOOL. But still able to homeschool, and still have a bright future.
Will Cain always come across as a total shithead!...
The caption is really sickening. Here is a parent (African American dad) that goes all out for his kids. Tells them they are the best, builds their confidence, secures them endorsement deals, shoes etc....all these so that they don't lack in any way. Very rarely (and I stand by my words) do you see a parent especially a Dad, do these sort of thing. And after all these is labelled as a Bad parent...GTFOH. Now this is why i dont watch , listen or read Mainstream media. If i hadn't known anything about Ball, i would have believed this bullshit. SMDH. I will give anything to have a DAD like Ball. Thankfully, i tell my kids everyday to believe in themselves, i tell them they are the best, they are beautiful and that no one can bring their confidence down.
he's raising all stars and doing an amazing job at it and its black thats the problem
max you did say the end justify the means you said lets see how it shapes up
White people always want to tell black people how to raise their kids. Now if all his kids had criminal records, and no father around they would love to use these kids in prison.
lamelo is the next Westbrook
MJ is worst

If your original 21 games go missing, note you can always restore them by clicking Kernel in HakChi then choosing flash original kernel.\nThe way I kept all original games while also adding new games to the system is by including all original stock games in my sync in HakChi.\nYou can download a version of the tool with all stock games included in the following link if you would also like to do it this way:\nhttps://mega.nz/#!FUk0XapI!PQj1BEuQxgUo-FNTeGs5mPEqhKXn4wZpAvXh1LYG6Fg
Great Job very easy to follow.
Since it's an *early version* I am going to wait for a while.
Anyone have a link to some roms to download?
Can I get a link to your desktop wallpaper??
Привет мэдмонкей и кластеру)))
Can you play Nes games on the Snes mini ?
Nice job. I think you can automate all of these steps from hackchi. It will be interesting to see updates, loved this video.
Hi Skullator, where can I find .sfc games, or do you have more games now formatted for the SNES mini?
does this work on windows 10? because i'm having trouble with getting cmd to load python36
You might want to run a batch script instead of invoking the cmd every time...
I alredy have 5 new games but i lost my pre installed 21..Do you know where can i find these twenty one?\nThanks a lot.
Also will this work with a MacBook?
i just want  to  an uni racer and turtles in time
Can you add a super gameboy rom to this system to play gameboy games?
@skullator can you up your custom kernel and post a link with all the games you have on yours so far?
But can it run Crysis?
Everything works fine except the 2 player controller does not work on the new games that are 2 player.\nnba jam, ken griffey jr baseball, killer instinct
Thinking about giving this a crack on a mac (hahaha), is there anything different you think in need to be aware of? Love video btw... very well explained and seems easy to follow!
I will get my SNES Mini today and then I will try this out. Seems not that hard. I'll share my experience later :)\n\nReally nice Tutorial btw! Your voice is extremely good to listen to^^
will NES roms work on SNES Classic?
Official Hakchi drops in a few days people.
Is there a way to add Super Mario bros classic game on SNES MINI CLASSIC?! Thank you.
chrono trigger crashes at the town square
Ok i know where they freezes came from, if i press the down analog on the Joystick i starts to stop working (Controller doesnt work anymore and its not possible to press something) but the console just keeps runnning.... idea?
Too much of a pain. Want be buying SNES mini yet. I do have an original SNES with wildcard and a ufo 9 sd copy. To be fair the pi emulator is not bad plus as more to offer
hey the games are not showing up in the hakchi games folder somebody please help
11:11 - doesn't even use find and replace :p
I'm going to test this using smc files tonight, wish me luck!
I'm sure that a hakchi update will fix the issue but the box art for the game you added looks so much smaller than the rest.  Hope they fix it.
Awesome! Easy to follow tutorial but many steps. But with the new SNES Classic can hold only around over 200 games in sfc format, not that much I can do anyway. I will back up all those original 21 games right away so in case if I mess up like those guys below, I can always put them back. Hopefully, there's a simpler way to do this and it can take zip files instead of sfc files.
You dont need to change the desktop file or else. Just add the sfrom in hakachi.
Awesome! Unlike other (also good) videos on this subject, you actually managed to keep the original games also!\nIf I'm going to wait for the official Hakchi2 update, I definitely go check out your vid again.\nJust out of curiosity, have you tried adding NES games?
Makes me really happy to see, that it definately works. Now it´s just a matter of time until the hakchi software is updated to do all the little steps that you showed here automatically. Thanks for this detailled description. Even if hakchi would never be updated i am pretty sure to get those steps done all by myself.
I have another question ^^ where can i find roms for SNES mini ? Can i have a link please ? thx and gj for your video
Is there currently a method to do this on Mac, or would it be the same?
not getting past dump. driver wont install
yis
Gonna buy mine later :)
Fantastic tutorial.
Nice screen saver dude
👀
Any Linux tools instead of WinDoze?
I love my sneeze mini
Nvm i cant download the sfc2s file
It works
I cant play 2 player games for any roms i download. Only the original 21 games work as 2 player. Please help?
Does this keep the original 21 games on it, even if we add a new game? It looked like it did as the 21 default games were selected, but I want to be sure :D
Can't wait to try this one. Got my Snes Mini just a few das ago. Thanks a lot for the effort man!
Nice to see your work getting mentioned in these hack articles mate getting your work noticed.
Epic im gonna go try this!
so I dumped the kernel and flashed it as custom kernel again, but I only see one single game called bioworm...\ndid I mess something up? SNES Classic still runs normally as it usually should do though
It works!\n\nI tried a few games and all of them work except the background music of a lot of games is acting up, like a cd that skips. Playing most games work flawlessly, except for 1 or 2 games that seem to lag when you run too fast.\nAlso, when I dump or flash a kernel, the light of the SNES turns on while step 4 in the process says that should not be the case. It does complete whatever it's doing so I guess it's alright. Between dumping the original kernel and flashing the custom kernel I reconnected the SNES. The light turned on again while flashing, but it completed without issue. I also checked if I could go back to my own original kernel and that works fine also.\n\nIt's a bit of work to put in for each game, but once they're on there, they're on there and I don't need an extra 100 games, just my personal classics. Ahhh Prehistorik Man :D\n\nThank you for the tutorial! :)
I'm giving away an SNES classic, check it out!!
i have a secont Problem, it worked to install the game i want but if i install it on the snes the 21 games are away, if i dump original kernel i dont have the game i installes, so how can i have the 21 games AND the new one i installed?
your video left me stuck on where i opened up the hackchi.exe. Am i suppose to plug in my snes mini before i open it up because it doesn't show any games what so ever.
I might wait until the easier method comes along :)
Where can I find that sweet desktop wallpaper of Link and Zelda? Also what is the name of the song at the end?
Just got Zombie Ate My neighbors working! Thanks a ton my dood!
Does SD2VITA work on 3.65?
I tried it on Japanese Super Famicom Mini. Sadly does not work. Tried to add Chrono Trigger but ended up with a faulty game and no other games on the roster. I can easily flash the original kernel to recover it though, but sad I can't add games. Any ideas?
I cannot proceed this further than the Sync Games. I could dump the kernel, flash the custom kernel - that was all fine. The driver installed correctly for that. But when I boot the mini NOT in diagnostic mode but just switching it on normally for game sync I can't get passed the Turn your NES Mini on.. dialogue. Hitting Install Driver from there pops up a command line NES mini not found, sorry. Any ideas?
I have several roms that are .smc or even .fig because they're translated... won't they work?
I can't set my console type to SNES Mini on this. It's only NES. Help?
I might be doing something wrong but i'm finding the second controller isn't working with the games i put on. (Stunt Race FX and Street Fighter 2 The New Challengers.)
cant add more than 30 games for some reason?
ok, error mate, when i try write my custom kernel, i get CANT WRITE TO USB, any ideas whats going on ? its does a few steps first then when it tires to write the actual kernel i get the above said error
How do I fill my Hakchi Games folder with the 21 games that came on the system? I've managed to get Super Star Wars working, but it's now the only game on the system.
Where did you get your wallpaper? Mind posting a link?
Does anyone know how many megabyte we have to store new games? I hope there will be lots of space to add games to the original 21!\n\n(I'm asking for the SNES Classic European version of there's a difference)\n\nThank you!
thank you Mr.Aussie!
I added 4 custom games. 1 image works but 3 of them don't appear on the SNES. It is in png. Does it have to be a specific KB size?
Will there be Game Genie support
We didn't compress the .sfrom file?
Lost all the original games, please help
Do all roms work?
How do I dump the original 21 Games? Is there any possible way?
my computer doesnt recognize the snes cause their is no driver available for it?
Please stop calling it Snes it is S-N-E-S ;D terrible to hear that ^^
Games load fine but I've lost all sound both in the loaded games and the originals anyone know how to fix this?
My Australian version SNES Mini is being held by US Customs. 😥
Cool but I'll hold off for a bit should be soon for this to become atomic like hakchi  is get covers etc... good work to the people that got this working 😎😎
The Hakchi2 tool linked to is still the 2.17 d in stead of the suposed 2.18 shown in the video. I get you did some work on getting this working. Its not version 2.18 in the download. Keep up the work with hacking the Snes mini though.
I can't get the original 21 to show up.  When I add new games they sync, but then the originals are lost.  I can flash the kernel back to restore them, but then I lose the additional games.
Hakchi wont let me select the snes mini
I am just a beginner with this but how do I reflash the  snes mini? I can't see anything in the menu of the hackchi program. And i only see my gam eof chrono trigger in the menu. Can you please help me? I want all the 21 games back...
U CAN JUST ADD SNES GAMES TO THE NES MINI WITH RETROARCH MOD AND BUY A SNES MINI CONTROLLER FOR YOUR NES MINI WHATS THE DIFFERENCE I UNDERSTAND HOW THE MODEL FOR THE SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT BUT STILL WHY NOT??? :/
Can the current version of hakchi2 brick my snes mini?
Followed these instructions to the letter and everything works great! Well, except for folders/pages on mine, changed to just show all games on the home screen and no more C8 errors. :D\nI can't seem to get Illusion Of Time/Gaia working though, from multiple sources/roms. Has anyone had any luck with this one?
if i use your link for the snes roms, what abuot save states and other saves? since i cant seem to find how to get my own games dumped with the auto folder? pretty confused since the games were never dumped? never owned a nes mini so new to this.
Does this work with Super Famicom Mini? Anyway to do this for the JP version?
I guarantee nobody will do any of those steps . Too many steps .
what is the outro music?
Awesome video! I have to ask though... why do you pronounce 'E' as 'I' and 'I' as 'E'?
when i open hakchi it only shows one game on the left under priginal 30 called bioworm.. no real games on the left side. any idea why?
you need more subs
dont worke isntalled the programm run cmd it says WRONG NAME OR NOT ON YOUR COMPUTER i installed it on C: dont worke BULLSHTI!
Wow!  I wanted a Snes Mini just for Star Fox 2 but I never tought it was worth it since it's very expensive here in Brazil.  But after watching your video I really want one!  That's amazing!  Thank you!
And the video starts with my favorite! Very nice!
how come you got chrono trigger its not on the snes mini.
I posted a video last week about my love for second hand shopping! If you didn't see that, then here is the link for you! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNjqAaNNgcw <3
Oh, I loved the outfit you were wearing while showing the watch! :)
I absolutely love listening to you speak. Your voice is so beautiful! You did well on your purchases good job!!
When will you be posting your hoarding documentary?
make a video showing how you sterilize jewelry?
Floral dress fits you like a glove.   \nYou look lovely in all the clothes you've chosen. Love the haul vlogs.x
i need a white girl with your voice omg
I love this video! I recently purchased a cardigan from New Life for £8.99 (I know it's a lot) but it turned out to be River Island and would normally cost £55!!!
you reminds me sooo much to lady diana, you're a really gourgeus woman and i love your videos, love from colombia!
the floral dress and the outfit that you wear when you show your watch are my favorites! I'm glad you found such nice things :-)
Has anyone ever told you you look like lady Diana? At least in my opinion haha. Lovely video as always by the way :)
You look so good in that tight floral dress! You have an amazing figure! <3
I own the small sleeping cat (or rather a similar one), but paired with a bigger mommy cat!! Maybe that's why it was such a good bargain :)
Lovely vid, and such a pretty gal <3
I love the dresses!! You have a great style! I have loved watching you grow and change over the years. You're so lovely Bex!
You truely found some amazing pieces, the dresses suit you so well! I also loove the pants (and the outfit in general) you are wearing in the splitscreen when showing off the watch <3
The charity shops in my area are horrendously expensive :( They sell 2nd hand Primark clothes for more money than Primark charges. \nI loved watching this video :) You are great at modelling!
This has actually inspired me to try thrifting! X
I love aaaall of the things. Beautiful. You look fantastic
Why is this on Trending at 9K views?
Thank you for this video! I love thrift-stores and secondhand clothes; I enjoyed this video a lot, and I would love to see more of these in the future!
YAY <3\namazing video! I LOVE thrifting, most of my clothes is also preloved and i love it.
Those clothes look great on you Beckie!
Cute cat. What happen to your right hand palm?
You say you live very far from minimalism with your hoarding and collecting, but I'm glad you offset that with thrifting!
I think selling a pair of 60 or 80 pound shoes for 20 pounds is still a good deal\nI don't expect those to be sold for 5 pounds
I recommend St Helena hospice they have a wide range of specialist charity shops around Essex not the cheapest but have seasonal sales.
So many of these are seriously so cute.  You may not follow trends (neither do I...why bother) but you seem to have a good sense for things that look good on you.  I love thrift stores!  Found many of my favorite articles of clothing there.
your jewelry is always amazing!
you sound a bit  breathless hope u are okay
I love the necklace that you're wearing!
Looks like you found some pretty good things. I love the blue skirt and shoes, super cute 😊
I hope you do more hauls in the future! xxx
Lady Rebecca is absolutely beautiful...I dare anyone to object...
I don’t normally watch haul videos, but as someone who when growing up frequently visited thrift shops, I find this quite interesting. You should make more.
I am so jealous of your finds!  Anytime I try out charity/thrift shops I rarely find anything good.  You have a great wardrobe filled with so many lovely finds.
You look amazing and have great modelling skills.  We have confidence in you. :)
I would love more of these videos
That blue dress looks amazing on you. I don't really like wearing second hand clothes, it's just the way I am, but I do get DVDs, old computer games and books from charity shops. DVDs especially, since I am old-fashioned and like physical copies of my films. If you're patient and don't mind being a few years behind the film industry , you can find them in their original plastic cover for no more than £2.99, depending on the area and shop. Jigsaws as well. You never need to buy a jigsaw at full retail price either. The other day I found a sealed copy of SimCity 3000 for £1.25 from a Cancer Research shop.
OMG I used to live in front of the Isle of Wight 😍
I live in Portsmouth so it was great to see someone else loving some of my local places :)
This is such a great video! I would love to see another one of these! Greetings and love from Germany!❤
Hello from the Isle of Wight! I'm a bit of a clothes hoarder and my things have been donated to charity shops all over the island - it's funny to think that you were probably flicking through rails full of my donations, haha!
One of my favorite thrift stores where I live is called Lifelong and they support HIV/AIDS resources in the area in many ways including hosting testing days. I enjoy knowing my already cheap purchase is going to have a bigger impact than shopping fast fashion
I didn't realize shoes could be that inexpensive. I don't think I own a pair of shoes that cost me less that $100.
Beckie, there's a woman working in my local supermarket who looks exactly like you!! You're both beautiful!
You're looking so well in your recent handful of videos. It's lovely to see.
Hey Beckie, I'd just like to recommend a series on the BBC Three YouTube channel, it's called Overshadowed. If you haven't watched it already, then give it a go! I love it and I'd also love to see someone review it! Love the new video and love you, stay strong, beautiful xx
I never watch hauls but I really enjoyed this! I'd love to see a favourites video :)
I love the floral dress and the coral blazer, especially together! ❤️ Really I love all the things you’ve shown today; you have such good luck with thrifting!
I went to Portsmouth too! It's lovely there :)
That floral dress is gorgeous on you. It shows off your figure and I really love it on you. You look beautiful.
I love your patterned trousers where did you get them from?
ahh i love thrifting too! it's like treasure hunting! regular shopping is exhausting and dreary for me but thrifting is always like a little adventure 😊
You dress very well, one thing I hate in modern fashion is Grey baggy tracky   bottoms, they are awful.
You don't need to be completely bound to the steasons.
Wow, that charity superstore must've been a dream... I bet they had to drag you out of there at closing time, haha! :D
Theres nowt wrong with your modelling skills 😉\nThe floral and the blue dress are excellent finds. \nMy weakness in charity shops tends towards pewter tankards (the older the better) and cufflinks (more pairs than you can shake a stick at), with the odd tweed jacket thrown in if its the right size/colour/pattern and make lol
YES. Before I even watch! LOVE!
Loved everything on you.
The dresses at 4:50 and 6:30 really suit you :D
You should do more fashion videos I loved this x
I love thrifting as well we have a big shop where the proceeds go to charity some are last seasons clothes from high street stores and other stuff is secondhand. It's amazing what you can find I buy clothes secondhand on eBay too, as student I'm always trying to save money.
Beckie I love you so much ❤️
I love the watch and mint skirt. After watching this I realized we have similar taste in clothing :)

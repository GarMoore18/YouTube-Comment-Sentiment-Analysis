Molto simpatico;)
raccaglia arabesca
What a belter 💯
Спартачи так же делали задолго до марселя )))
0:12 did he smell his own sweaty armpits or something what's that face for lol.
Why did the keeper try to save it
Take notes Messi
what a boring sport
Hey, Tom, you know what really gets numbers on YouTube? Videos about financial minutiae. (Prof. Rouwenhorst is spectacularly overqualified for this interview; he's one of the world's leading experts on finance and financial history, and I'm really grateful he was able to take the time to talk about the original bond!)
Does anyone reckon Tom Scott is obsessed with himself? Just go onto his YouTube channel page and count how many times you can see his face. Its actually quite disturbing.
I counted the singular or plural version of the word 'bond' 21 times in 3 minutes and 57 seconds.
Why won't the US government define that this paper doesn't have relevance anymore and the debt is considered paid already?
Next week on can't pay? We'll take it away!...
hehehe lovely... i used to swim and ride bike around that area
Haven't watched this yet: Is this Brittain's debt incurred through Mr. Blunt's South Sea Company?
Imagine if the Darian loans needed to be paid back with interest?
I feel like I just had a stroke and lost my ability to understand what's being said. Confusing video.
But can it be hacked?
Things like this are not as funny as you might imagine - they provide legal example and precedent for much more odious debt all over the world via US Trade Agreements, and Harvard are leading cheerleaders this nasty endeavor.
What's the part that says w w w w x x x x?
I was worried, until he said the bond pays $13 per year.\nThen it is just goodwill thing.\nThank You for sharing.
Damn, I would love to have Tom Scott's air miles. They would be huge!
That is just so effing interesting. <-- not sarcasm
I am a Dutchman and I did not even know about this. Shame on me! Thank you very much for sharing this with us all, Tom Scott! Keep up the good work!
Bank: How's your credit?\n\nWater Company: I've paid on time for 300 years. \n\nBank: Eh, denied.
Holy crap Tom's gonna get to 1 mil subs!
If I saw Tom I would hug him so hardly <3
Will they cash in the bond?
All the old timers talk about inflation this, inflation that:  back in my day a gallon of milk and a loaf of bread cost me 5 cents So why did this bearer bond/perpetual bond never rise according to inflation?
When are they next paying. I wanna go. Let's have a party.
Yale has never had a problem propagating fraudulent legal contracts. It's the only way the truly useless in our society can feel as if they are contributing.
Why didn't they pay it all off ages ago, surely it's a lot more expensive to keep paying interest off forever?
The name is bond, James bond.
I love videos like this
I was expecting the bond to be worth millions 😂
Why was the interest payment lowered? Was it by the payer or the payee who decided that?
Is it still possible to trick someone into signing a perpetual bond?
While in New Haven, I hope you were able to take advantage of timing to learn about the City's green.  I sent you an email on it a while back.  Intriguing ownership and management of a public space. - and a neat place for a park bench episode.
Idk who this guy is but he looks like Jenna marbles on the thumbnail
plot twist. they pay interest for a Jew Banker
Is this guy 30 or 60 I'm not sure
So it's a kind of pond bond?
The name's bond. Government bond.
This is why in the Abrahamic religion God forbade interest because it is an evil practice. The Jews came changed that all around and now it so wide spread in all its evil corrupt glory.
Are you still in debt for to your old hairdresser? That might explain why your sporting a hairstyle from the 90s!
I know one debt that still keeps paying. \n\nColonialism.
I am disappointed Tom Scott neglected to explicitly mention a pregnant point: governments that control their own currency can inflate their way out of debt. That is not financial minutia. It is a power that many in governments in Lisbon, Madrid, Dublin, and Athens likely miss dearly.
I wonder how long until they give up on that lettering system (aaaaaaa, bbbbbbb, ...) and just switch to spreadsheet-style lettering (fa, fb, ..., ga, ..., ).
Damn that's something I might not have known, cool.
Talk about a raw deal.
In only 500 years, someone might find the United States national debt interesting.
I thought this was Edd China's channel.
This is the sort of stuff i like to see trending on YouTube.
Britain has been sending a bill to the U.S. every year since 1773 for the tea that we threw into the harbor. Every year we disregard it and don’t pay it off
It may be the epitome of boredom to watch paint dry, but perhaps it would be less boring if it were drying for over 350 years.
Ok can we do this with national debt but forever?
Tom, you are close to 1,000,000 subscribers. With videos like this, you deserve every single one. Well done, Tom. Keep the great videos coming.
These are the things I'd be willing to pay for. That's just funny.
Dutch water authority goes to the bank We need a loan Have you taken out any loans in the past Well let me tell you a story...
I saw the 12th of January and thought ooh my birthday time to click 😂.
hey guys does anybody knows what is the video where tom talks about trumps winning elections (he said something about talking the elephant in the room i think)
But hang in dint these get adjusted for inflation aswell?
Awesome. What a piece of history!
1€ per month? That ain't too shabby for the money needed to build that dike thing!\nHypothetical scenario: Water authority says screw this, I want to keep my 12€. Yale (like he said, against all odds), sues them for the 12€ of interest.\nThey get laughed out of court.\n\nNos respice ad futurum.
€11 a year?? Might as well stick that up your arse.
Wish house loans were like this.  You'd have more generations of families living in the same home..
Me and my student loans
No Thames bond but there is a British consol (perpetual bond) that was issued to pay for war expenses during WWI and also some from the South Sea Bubble of 1720 that still pay regular interest. They are often mentioned in finance classes as they are a special case of present value calculations. When I was at MSU in the 1970's one of my Finance professors had a French Consol that had been issued to help Napoleon pay for his wars. Not sure if it was still paying interest or not.
Guilders already was obsolete currency. So isnt that mean this bond was already void???...
What...default the debt...dude they only pay like €11 a year....geez
Tom, you have the funnest videos
capitalism boys
lannisters always pay their debts
Lackdike Boavendums
YEAH!!! Dutch stuff love ya tom!
Nice Passive Income.
so cool
Trump's wall?
James Bond.
English invaders.
also, did you know that people from phoenix are called phoenicians?
Sadly, had the bond been cashed in coin, the coins would be worth orders of magnitude more than the inflated paper you would get today.
3:20 but isn't suing someone america's favourite pastime?
Tom Scott, fab video really enjoyed it.
another channel that has a percentage of the followers it should have...
This just reminds me of Brady Haran's ridiculous £2 house payment.
Ahh, I love stuff like this! I've never watched a Tom Scott video and found it boring! Just wish there were more!
Why didn't I know you were coming to Yale! I go to school here!
You just didn't bother with trying to pronounce it correctly, did you?
So my dutch tax money goes partially to yale...\nHmmmm.... not to fond of that
It's very bizarre really, youd think the water board would buy the bond themselves and in effect nullify it. Whilst €13 euros isn't a lot, it's still taxpayers money, bare in mind the arrangements for preparing and paying invoices often outstrip the debts themselves - sometimes as much as €50. In this instance it's $1000s of dollars on plane flights and hospitality at the other end.. And if yale are paying that themselves, doesn't it do the paying students a discredit?
If youve got a social security or personal pin number, your born into the debt of your country.
Student loan joke! Ha! I'm orignal!
People are awesome!
Hey Tom
Cool
Very smile worthy history
Top quality Tom Scott.
Did he say lecduck beuvendams?
Hahahah Why is the so awesome?
Ma name-a jeb
Amazing!!
(((juice)))
Good thing it wasn't compound interest. The Dutch government would go bankrupt.
what is your obsession with red shirts?
god, capitalism is so stupid
Makes no financial sense to continue it really. Consign to history.
My name yokobo \nI come frm Uganda\nThis video I not understand\nPls understand me\nI am yokobo\nBye
If only she'd known what buttons are...
0:09 when anyone talks to me
Why can't it be called gameboy-girl
Big surprise. Technology changes. \n\nI bet all of you $200 that you don't know how a rotary dial telephone works.
I just wanna press all the buttons for her! ARGH! SO TRIGGERING! KIDS THESE DAYS HAVE NO CULTURE
That is so sad
This reminds me of back to the Future when Marty is mocked for using hands to play an arcade game
Why can't she play it I mean it's pokemon yellow
This kind of saddens me. I’ve never owned a gameboy but i had a ds and similar stuff when i was like 6. I guess the world is changing, gotta accept it
She thinks it's a mini Ipad
Giving young kids smart devices..this is where should start
i'm also a big fan of Ethan and Dolan\n0:09
Oh no, what have phones done to the youth? Now they can never enjoy a good ol gameboy anymore. :(
Old people> Doesn’t understand touchscreen. Younger people> Doesn’t understand control pads.
Its my birthday plz give a like and help me out by subscribing
That is so jokes
kids in 2045: mom! the touchscreen on this game boy advanced isn’t working!
This is sad. Not because she couldn’t figure it out. But because it’s obvious how much time she spends using daddy’s iPhone rather than playing outside etc.
I hate that kid with a passion.
Roses are Red\nViolets are Blue\nI wasn't first\nAnd neither were you
She's so cute 😍
I am disappointed by all modern parents who don't show their kids old music or video games  like vynil or super Nintendo. Instead of getting a fucking I pad where all they do is hit fruit on a screen. sit down listen to some music watch a movie you liked as a kid or go outside WITH your child. Inroduce them to everything you liked as a child, you will be able to connect with them and make you and your kid happy
I had PK Yellow with the Green GBC too. We had a good life :)
For a second there I too wondered what was wrong
I died  a little
I like the hand movement at 0:01 like WTF! this shit don't work!
The baby will keep on touching the screen and not the buttons
Why are people saying thus is sad?
Only 90s kids will know
This was on winnipeg news!
This what happens when they use iPads as if EVERYTHING IS A TOUCH SCREEN
It's official...anyone born 90-96 ur old
I am so sad right now
She's so young but doesn't see the buttons lol
I'm 20 years old rapper who's trying to make his dream come true. I would really appreciate If you could like, share and support. Thx for your time man.
WHAT HAS THIS WORLD COME TO???????
Lol, it's kinda sad but really funny to see that a little kid doesn't know how to use a Game Boy Color.
....I'm lost for words
Never owned one myself but this is just sad.
I can't imagine being born into this generation of technology
i just made a video like this hope everyone found mine funny
This hurts me so much :(
Has she ever pressed a button? Does button still exist in 2017?\nWhy is he filming in vertical?
How did this get so many views
You're saying that in your time you pressed buttons??!!!
To who all thinks this is sad... welcome to whatever century we're living in.
of course it‘s only a child but jesus people are getting dumber and dumber
I knew it was coming but it still felt bad :(
Any small youtubers wanna support each others channels? :) :)
This made me really sad.
what have we done!?
Why can't it be called game boy girl?
She came from the past to the present to see wat the game boy would look from now realises it’s the same😤
I come from the future! I can beat Pokemon on Gameboy!!! *Pokes screen over and over*
How is this 4 on trending
Lmfao. Only 80s and 90s kids will understand
Girl pretending that a Game Boy is an Iphone/Ipad....
when I got my first game boy I bite it to see if it was a cookie
Give it to a pensioner and they'll probably do the same
Lmao, she really thought it was touchscreen. This is how you know we barely used buttons on our devices anymore 😭😭😭
Well she was born after touch-screen was invented what do you expect?
Saw a little girl yesterday who swiped on a physical picture on a wall.. When nothing happened, she told her dad that the screen was broken.
😢
Lol
Lmao
Why is this trending
Why is this trending
Sigh...
Recognize Pokémon Yellow anywhere 😊
😂😂😂
Thats so sad...
AYUH. IT’S POKÉMON YELLOW
Hahahahaahha

DISGUST.
Game boy girl
This is disheartening
Fine Bros disliked this video.

And......?
This hurts my heart
She's so adorable
Ohhh sweet! XD
Not everything is touchscreen
...
why this trending？
guess the buttons arent big enough...
Sad
XD omg cringe worthy
Kids these days...
i cri eri tim
The future is ruined
you picked gold version over silver....you were one of those people.
I'm only 16 and this makes me want to cry
Most of these comments sound ignorant as fuck. It's called progression, there will come a point that device interaction will be voice and gesture, without the use of physical interaction. It's like a bunch of cavemen shouting about how she also can't make fire with 2 sticks, it's a useless skill put next to a lighter.
fall vibes are the best🌅🌙🍁🍂
Zoe, you can use that rose gold tiny watering can as a vase and add little wildflowers in them or something. It's really trendy right now, I see it all over Pinterest :)
Anyone else want to go and get a Pumpkin Spice Latte straight after watching this!?

I have super soft sheets as well and I love them. I use them in the Summer too lol. One thing is the pillowcases make your hair really staticky, but for me it’s worth it because it’s so comfortable :)
Not gonna lie the only thing wrong with this video is it is to short😍 love ya' Zoe xx

You're right to worry Zoe, I've had fleece sheets before... never again! That being said, I'd still use the main sheet from the set as a minimalist duvet in the thick of winter! It looks good with a fur throw, but has to has cooler sheets underneath...!
I love your videos!
I wish the video was longer!
Clicked on this faster than I blinked
Awww Gabriella has the same peach bedding ❤️😘
*THUMBS UP IF THE WATER MOMENT HAS YOU SHOOKETH!!!* 😱🌏✨
Please do full face using only Halloween makeup
This is the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen in my life. Please do a tutorial using this!!!!
Then all the sudden your date's like... 'oh, baby' IM SHREAKING
What is in your lips gurl?
They sell this product at London drugs at least in Canada anyway in case anyone was curious!
Have you tried lipsense. Lipstick that last 18 hours
i love wunderbrow i have babies so whenever we go out i use that one and its so good specially swimming hahaha
hahahha where was this product in highschool in pe lmao ;)
I don't have 8 minutes for one eyebrow 😬
things that will survive a nuclear bomb:\nNikki's Eyebrows!
I've been using this for years 😂
wait wait wait so then it will come off with makeup remover tho right? its not like a brow stain?
My mom uses wonder brow. She does use the wand tho. Her eyebrows always look great and stay on really nicely
My mom and sister uses that and they love it!
What is her lipgloss 😍😍I need it
This is what I need 😍😭
This intro could not be more relatable.
Full brows can be a struggle like all the time
I use baby oil to take mine off. A lot cheaper than their tiny bottles of cleanser
Only 2 days late (better than last time)🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
I need a minute 😂
I've been wanting to get this product for a while but was so skeptical about it 😱 it keeps popping up on my Facebook page and now im convince 😍 im definitely getting it!!! I always have problems with my brows because im constantly touching my face when I'm stressed out and rubbing my makeup off
I have clear eyebrows with red hair. Eyebrow tint was a miracle I found in college. Just brush them in and done. I am wanting to try brows like Nikkie though. It's like opposite day!
I would love a product like this for the lips..
Where did you get this?? I need it!
I love watching your videos it doesn't matter what video you do, you still manage to make me smile or laugh. I love every video you make and seriously if I had  natural eyebrows like your I would be so happy. :)
This is amazing for band camp and for my iNCRedibly humid climate in Texas!
You need to try the new trend glitter toung
This is industrial strength stuff - loved the way it sits on my face, got a few compliments but the amount of brow hairs it took out upon the removal of the product  (because you should not sleep in make up!) was just not worth it
So, I shave off half of my brows. I’m also in marching band. My brows sweat off. Has anyone used this product on bare skin and has it stayed the same???
I hardly have any brow hairs though 😔\nI want to try it anyways, and i hope it works just as well
So AWESOME product! and i LOVE YOU Nikkie! Im from México LOL
Need to know what lip gloss you're wearing 😭
I absolutely LOVE using this!! It makes me not so self conscious about my eyebrows. It lasts about 3 days, with no touch ups, on me including through showers & sweating. I also mix the colors Brunette & Black/Brown to make the perfect shade for me. So if there isn't a perfect color for you, try mixing them!
my mom used this and her right brow just won't accept the pigment😂😂i use it now😂😂😂
clean and clear makeup wipes remove the product as well because they can remove waterproof makeup
I have naturally ginger hair and for some reason, the BLONDEST eyebrows so I CANNOT find a brow product that works for me. It's always been too blonde or too brown, and with pencils and powder my blonde just shows through and looks a w f u l. I cannot live without brows as I hate my natural Ones, and I'm desperate to find a shade for me that will not only COVER the blonde, but match my hair. My largest bet right now is trying the Anastasia Beverly Hills dipbrow in auburn or caramel...any opinions?
Holy crap I need this product
What brush does she use?
Girl !! I been with that since it came out !!! I LOVE IT !!!
I miss the literal makeup tutorials. Kind’ve over the “reaction” videos.
I think Makeup Revolution made a dupe of this, I got it for my birthday and its pretty good\n<3
I prefer this eyebrows
But like your eyebrows looks beautiful😍😍😍😍😍😍
Halleluja!!
what gloss is she wearing tho
Bought love thisssss
what lip gloss are you wearing???
OMG YOU SHOULD DO MICRO BLADING IN YOUR EYEBROWS ITS LIFE CHANGING AHHHH!!
WUNDERSCHÖN ♥ ♥ ♥
Okay, literally shook. 😻😻
Her reactions are amzinv
Nikkie can make anything works
I love the wunderbrow!!!! They sell it at cvs too. It’s my everyday wear. Will come off with face wash 😘😘
I personally agree with the using concealer to shape is essential with this product.\nI do have thicker brows than Nikkie, but I use wonderbrow on an angled brush to fill my brows in and I never shape them with concealer. It does take some time to get the hang of the product, though.
It gives you perfect brows in under 2 minutes. *scoff* uh... no. Me too honestly
I love this!!!😂😂😂 this was so funny to watch!!!!!! Love you  😍😘💝💓
I have wunderbrow and it is amazing but the texture of your eyebrows with it On is heavy
I love her kind of happy personality 🖤🖤
I’m surprised you haven’t gotten micro needled or microbladed
take her to the pool on the first date they said\nha bitch you thought
It’s amazing
I have been using this product for 3 yrs.  I'm a fair skinned redhead.  Get this.
wish I had your natural brows
Love you, you're beautiful <3
I use wunderbrow everyday. I love it!!!!! ❤️
Ok... how about someone with no hair at all..
soooo distracted by the beautiful lipgloss you're wearing!! which one is it?? love your vids!! <3
Question!!\n\nHow did you take it off in the end? What actually removes the product?
Lies. Makeup is all lies.
I use this for my brows and I LOVE IT!! I have really oily skin and other products dont last but this one never lets me down! So happy you agree!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA OMG I LOVE HER REACTIONS
👍👍👍
WHAT LIP GLOSS IS THAT !!!!
LOL YOU ARE SO SHOOKETHHHH
I need that
Awww Nickie your reactions are adorable
Go Netherlands ❤️❤️💪🏻lol ik ben Nederlands en ben trots op deze meid 💖
Ik weet nu pas dat zij nederlands is door stuktv Xdd
Nikki geweldig voor je dit product komt op tijd waar bestel je dit !
I watched WAYY too many makeup tutorials and I should be good at makeup but apparently that's not how it is 😂😭
YOU SHOUKD FOLLOW YOUR OWN MAKEUP TUTORIAL FROM YOUR FIRST VIDEO
I really don't like that her brows are ALWAYS carved out, I wish she would leave them so they look more natural
Nikki 😂 this is why we read all the instructions beforehand
Her accent has gotten SO GOOD!!!
Lol i cant believe it took u this long to try the wunderbrow... Ive had mine for months now like 6-7 months girl u behind haha
you have a thumbs down for me until we get an answer!
nikkie im sorry but if u speak dutch then german shouldnt really be that difficult gurl wunderschön is pronounced voonder-shern
You are just the ugliest thing aren't you ? I HATE MAKE UP THE ONLY THING THAT IS RELEVANT ON EARTH IS DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS, DARKSOULS, ANIMEE AND MARVEL/DC
WTF YouTube!!!\nWhy so many suggestions about make up for little sluts?
You're amazing in the big escape btw love it
So I'm just scrolling through trending, then I see this here Emperor Calus looking thing in there. I miss when trending used to be actually interesting stuff everyone enjoyed.
Get your brows microbladed
oh my gawd take the brush out and keep putting it back in and out its like pussy lmao
You are looking more beautiful  without makeup
She should try micro blading
Your german is so good 😊 are you from germany or why can you speak it so good?
i've used wunderbrow and i really like it, its surprisingly cool toned which is nice because few things are
I have this in my makeup box of makeup I don't use... time to take it out!
Am I the only one loving these behind the scenes vids
Queen 👑❤️
I love you so much, Taylor!!
Taylor  is so amazing
I always feel for Meredith whenever Taylor talks about Oliva, It's like Mere is now the weird uncle that no one talks about that you only see when it's a full moon and snowing in summer.
Love u taylor swift like if you agree!!
This is her best look in the music video!
they should do a bts to the dance scene featuring Todrick Hall !
Ytf these bts vids are not opening in India.
I love you Taylor!! IDC if the old Tay is dead, I don't even care what kind of Taylor you are!!
Is anyone else being to the video is not available?

Omg I will literally give up my life for Taylor swift
Why did you split you shit.  I get it but still. She crazy.
She's still as adorable as before!! aww...
I'm so jealous I can't watch this vids... 💔💔💔
0:23 Taylor is going so hard in her new songs and music video. But BTS, she is still the same old sweet girl we love and know.
Already have them on pre-order <3
WHY CANT I WATCH IT
YouTube should make a love button already...
Can't play the video
I want to sample that ass.
The video starts\n*blinks *\nIt ends
Whenever I try to watch this it says video not available 😭 J used her IG story, the link and even tried searching! Can anyone help me view this
See haters! Taylors still the same! She's just trying something new! She likes change.....
looking forward to this album 🐍🐍🐍
1:05-1:37\n\nIt would be One of the Best ringtones ever😂
Does anybody realize this music video has over 470 million views?!
I honestly can't wait for my reputation magazine to come omg
i'm from brazil \nlook what you made me do taylor swift?
Wasn't used in the video
First thing I looked at was how long the video went for, to see if the whole music video was at the end. 😁
THIS STUPID NAZI WHORE SHOULD WEAR THE NAZI UNIFORM IT WOULD SUIT HER WELL
I was surprised that the music video wasn’t at the end of this one this time. But either way. I’m loving these bts videos! ❤️
Taylors lying, the old Taylor is still alive I saw it and I'm REALLY happy!!
I love you Taylor
Taylor is just so down to Earth that I love it
My friend and I were amused now that Taylor dances choreographically!
the video dont working
I got this notification at school and had to wait :(
The old Taylor might be dead, but the New Taylor has the exact same personality that we all love!
I wanna see the BTS with her on the throne of snakes and the U SQUAD scene!
cats are the best!
WHY I CAN'T READ THE VIDEO!!!
Taylor Swift is a musical genius and marketing genius! I bought 2 new REPUTATION albums and a large merchandise order to give for holiday gifts! 1989 was an incredible concert....CAN NOT WAIT to bring my daughter to Taylor's REPUTATION concert!!! Thank you for thinking of your fans! <3 Look What You Made Me DO! Unbelievable song! # 1 Music Charts!

If only harambe was here to see this amazing masterpiece.. :(
I didn't even know Velcro was an actual brand till now.
You are only *just now* making an effort to keep people from using Velcro as a generic word? Probably a little too late.
Hook and loop - 3 syllables\nVelcro - 2 syllables\n\nSorry, sticking with what's easier to say.
yeah good luck with that.  talk to Xerox
Funny video but I'm still gonna call it velcro lmfao
This video is clearly meant to be humorous and tongue-in-cheek. Nobody at Velcro thinks this video is going to change people's vocabulary.
I'm still going to call it Velcro. And if that makes you cry, grab a Kleenex.\n\nNow where did I put my Vaseline...?
It's funny I haven't seen Hoover make sarcastic youtube videos.
This is hilarious. I had to check to be sure, but I'll tell my customers we sell Velcro brand hook & loop. Or just Velcro for short.
velcro sounds better
It's too late. Velcro is already common parlance for that type of fastener. Just like band-aid, and kleenex are common parlance now. Give it up. And no one cares if your trademark goes away.
lol this marketing is actually pretty good, it's just a hit or miss thing, next time just get a few bots to get that initial positive reaction so the community follows. or u know, hire me.\nanyway, peace.
How to backfire, John Oliver Style.
Get better at marketing then??

I love VELCRO® Brand hook and loop.
Apparently people on YouTube are very bad at recognizing joke videos and picking up on when messages are tongue-in-cheek. How can you watch this and think Velcro is doing it in earnest?!
Not sure why everyone is so butt hurt. This is a clever and creative video with a hilarious message. I dig it.
My Velcro didn't hold up now I have to get some Kleenex and Clorox to clean the spill and probably use some Germ X after.
The sneaker heads will be like\nAhhh he got the hook and loop\n\nSorry guys. Doesn't work.
Not only will I continue to call it velcro, but this song has further persuaded me to purchase non Velcro branded velcro.
this was actually fun
This is like trying to tell me Plato isn't a planet.
No worries guys, nobody even heard of you in Poland, there won't be any infringement.
I wanna work there
Brilliant song, very catchy, well made point, very funny, and yet... it's still fucking velcro. The difference between Velcro (R) and velcro is the logo and the (R). If you didn't like it you shouldn't have waited 60 years to address the problem.
Can you guys just become a company that manufacturers music videos of interacial lawyers singing.
That's just glorious. Thanks for the link, Reddit.
Comments are full of idiots who don't understand satire.
I'm calling it velcro anyway just out of spite. That way, your trademark with dissipate as it becomes common name. Just like  all band aids are band aids, so now the brand has to call it band aid brand.
This is one of the best things I have seen all week. I will try very hard not to call it &*^!@# and share this to anyone who will watch it on ... that social media site.
should call it ssrrcccctttccchhhh one word and its the sound it makes
Hook and loop? Nah, velcro.
overly expensive - generic velcro far more economical.
Redditor and legal enthusiast here (I once beat Phoenix Wright Ace Attourney). These lawyers are right, it's wrong to use VELCRO® as if it were a common word. Social Justice has taught me that cultural appropriation is very real and harms creators of that culture. Therefore, we are appropriating the company culture of Velcro Brand Companies when we use VELCRO® outside of its intended legal context. Please refrain from velcroing this video with your ignorance.\n~Bertie Gallagher, moderator of r/legaladvice and r/INTELLECTUALPROPERTY, IQ of 172
What if lawyers from companies all over just tried to get trademark laws changed to reflect the way that information spreads and adapts in a society with social media?\nThink it was bad before the internet?
I suppose they want us to stop calling shirts with collars polos, referring to mopeds as vespas, and assuming all pregnancy pills are plan B also.
Internet and people's mind 101: I don't tell people what you don't want them to do. Cause it's gonna be worst
I actually love this! and the song is so catchy!
Guts, it's obviously a joke, calm down
Do people actually call bleach products Clorox? I've not heard it personally as common for bleach. The others? Sure
Velcro shoes is using it as an adjective, not a noun or verb. Editorial my friends, editorial.
Honestly you should called yourselves Hook and Loop so that you won't have to worry about that stuff
Saying, velcro shoes places the word velcro as an adjective. It describes the type of shoes as a noun modifier.
It is and always will be velcro, no one would even know what I'm talking about if I said hook and loop get outta here.
I found this hilarious lol\nUnsuccessful.... but still very funny
ok this was hilarious well done, from now on if i see it i'm saying  that fucking hook and loop
Ok i got go now lemme get my velcro shoes and my velcro wallet and my velcro socks and my velcro car and my velcro jacket
Tell that to Hoover. :-)
Working as an aircraft mechanic, EVERYONE in the industry will call it Velcro, so it a WAY to late to change the naming
Okay okay I won't say it anymore!
I think I've just been velcroed...
from the same people who brought you the yo yo and the slinky
Ok so wtf is up with this INSANE 90s NOSTALGIA CRAZE and NO ONE has brought back blading or even talked about it? MAKE AMERICA SKATE AGAIN
Whatever the hell they were trying to do with this video, they failed.  Also, this message is at least 30 years too late to change how people talk.  Probably more.
I'm going to find some off-brand velcro, and just stick it to things. I may the Hoover up the mess, when that fails, i'll go Google the way to do it properly. We don't get to decide how the world uses words, stop being a cuck about it.
Sorry, no one is ever going to call it hook and loop. Thats just reality
ok i wont, do I get a cookie
It is like Band-Aid too
0% chance of hook and loop taking off, but a damn catchy song nonetheless.
Inb4 video is deleted.  \n\nThis company that makes velcro has goofed up.
They are my velcro to the other velcro part....
kys
lol why are so many people getting butthurt about this video. yall a bunch of virgins. thumbs up for pissin off reddit nerds.
Velcro.
Self-qualified lawyer here. I absolutely *adore* this video, for it reinforces the belief that we should protect the very best of our society, including multi-billion dollar corporations. It's sickening knowing that people are appropriating VELCRO®, knowing fully they are diminishing the real brand. As an upstanding Redditor, I'll upboat this video for visibility, so reap karma VELCRO®, you deserve it.
omg ha
Velcro\n\nTrademark (TM) 2017 Velcro R company.
velcro
Velcro right?
Velcro for president
Dang. Velcro Lawyers harmonizing something fierce at 1:44
*Velcro.*
I'll stick to velcro..
Velcro.
Maybe it would be cheaper to just give up the trademark.
VELCRO!
If you own or work for Velcro you are making bank. This is how corporations control you. Slowly and surely.
This video gives exactly the reason why to call it velcro in the first place. Trademarks are stupid. Nobody wants to make lawyers richer. As soon as you have an idea and share it, it should belong to the people. Making money off of an idea is wrong
No.
no
this is bad
I just took time out from hoovering the inside of my JCB to google that. I was so distracted I walked straight into a dumpster, and  now I need a band-aid for the cut on my arm. I wiped some of it with a kleenex, and smeared some vaseline over it.
Marketing: We make bags, straps and bookends now. TIME FOR A REBRAND!
justin mercado wasted the first comment, then edited it, then wasted second comment and edited that one too, then ten minutes later he came back and wasted third comment. Now I'm sitting here getting 5th when I should have 3rd.
I didn't waste my time watching the whole vid , or reading all the comments, but didn't you 'lawyers' steal this song?
And if you make a mess using Hook and loop remember to hoover it all up.
sorry but your annoying bleep filled song isnt going to work. Its Velcro. Deal with it.
I don't care. It's called velcro no matter who makes it, just like band aids, roller blades, kleenex and myriads of other things.\n\nI will not let some corporate stooge tell me what nouns I should be using.
I can't tell if this is supposed to be funny. But with so much going on in the world, and the local all-news station deeming this important enough to mention, all I can say is: Boo-Hoo! What problems we rich folks have to contend with.
for doing this dumb video,  I will always call it velcro and I hope you lose your trademark
This video straight up made me cry for some reason. Like this is a hook and loop kicked in and I sobbed.
Generocide is a thing layers.
Velcro
Can I replaced all my nouns with VELCRO®?
This is amazing! More name brands need to be like this!
I was with you until the censored swearing.  I would have shown my kids, so they could learn the right way, but you had to make it dirty.
Hook and loop? Maybe if you had a shorter, catchier name for it we wouldn't have been calling it velcro to begin with. I'm not going to call it hook and loop.
You should have shown us the projects that failed. would have been nice to see what went wrong.
Congatulations on your wedding!!!!   I would be so scared to eat moldy food even though I would buy it.  LOL  🌴💖🌹🌸💚😛🌺🤗🌻😀🌴

Man that looks amazing!! Congrats on your wedding and welcome back!! Im actually going to shoot my Brothers Green BGBQ video today!!!! I can't wait to get that out!
Next time: homemade tempeh? :)
I woke up to find a Brothers Green Eats and a SortedFood video in my subscription box. Is today my birthday or something? Anyway, congratulations on your marriage!
You are not supposed to cook the miso for minutes. It actually looses flavour the longer you cook it. You are suposed to add it disolved at the last step and then turn the stove off inmediatly or ideally just before adding it. You'll realise like that that a little bit of miso will add more flavour than a lot of it cooked for minutes
Congrats bro!
He's alive
I literally had no idea what miso was made of! The things you learn on this channel. However I have 0 patience so I think I would just buy this
Heck yeah, glad to hear you're married and well! I'll step up my miso game too and abandon my stores soup packets
Congratulations. Just subscribed to your new Instagram. Are you still living in New York. I see your brother has moved. Wishing you much success
Great vid! Would love to see a full length video on the miso fermentation
Congratulations!!! Yay love!

Congratulations on getting married!!!
Nice! I was wondering about this. :) Ps. Congrats!
You guys, uh, *sigh* really love your cilantro...
You got some doo doo in that jar? Good for you, finally a chef who can cook a good doo doo dish!
3 seconds off of that extra ad revenue. \nRespect.
does anyone have a count on the word miso ? lol \nall jokes aside,  great vid. Miso is the shizz.
You got married? Oh you poor fool. I hope it's a painless.
Think maybe YouTube Red would take your show?
What's the video about?
He is so much different when he’s not high
Do you have any recipes with Tofu Noodles. i've been making it sort of like a Pho.  Curious to see what else there is to do with it.
Thought I was watching cheese
Yay! My favorite BG brother is back...
This is so cool! I didn't know that miso was made like this. Could you try making tofu?
how long can you store the ready miso paste, and where would you store it?
Welcome back! Missed you and look forward to all your projects. Thank you for sharing.
Nice idea, this miso tomato soup.\nBut first you cook your soup and then you have to add miso at the end of cooking. Miso shouldn't get boiled. The mother of my husband is from Japan and told me so.\n:)
44k in 13 hours gets to trending page but when ricegum gets 100k views in an hour it’s nowhere to be found 🤷🏽‍♀️
I didn't know I was a type of rice.

Congrats bro!
miso is kinda halfway to soy sauce. so try making soy sauce next?
Where's the link for  the koji rice?
Wooow, i'm from Spain and I appreciate thaaat :3 crongrats for ur wedding. I watch eeevery vídeo and I LOVE the channel
Congratulations! Was afraid we were down to one brother. Lots of big changes for Brothers Green. Now we need some cooking challenges every now and then. Test tasters would have to travel -- almost sound like a perfect job for your parent (grandmas will want to visit more when grandkids come along). Of course, Mama Green may not be the best judge for two of her own. LOL.
Thats a lot of miso. I could take some off your hands if you want
I've made miso soup about 5x's now & LOVE ❤️ LOVE ❤️ IT!!!!! A lot of Americans are unaware of it, it seems.
That looks so warm and comforting.\n\nCongratz on ur marriage❣️
Hi! I'm from Spain and I'm really glad you have enjoyed your trip here in Spain :)
You should make some asian style grilled cheese with that misomato soup😝
Guys if you can't find Koji rice, you can make miso paste by combining store bought miso with cooked soy beans ( yellow peas work as well) and salt. Leave it ferment and don't forget sprinkle a layer of salt to prevent mold.
Watching this as I'm eating my 90¢ ramen and pretending I'm eating this instead. Looks so good!
I'M FROM SPAIN, PLEASE RECOMMEND SOME RESTAURANTS/ PLACES TO EAT
Congrats on your wedding man... you scored big time.. the misses is so beautiful!
Yayyyyy, the boss is back!
Freaking love you alls channel. I have been watching y'all for a few years and I just love the content but yalls voices are soothing AF as well 😂

well Hey, Lets meet the Mrs.............
You are so cute. And it is so sad that you are off the market. But your wife is very pretty. All the best to you! Please keep doing videos so that we can continue to enjoy your cuteness <3

So is Brothers Green going bye bye since they're both doing their own thing?
1st
thank god. I've missed you!
Palm sugar and other palm products aren't sustainable, man. Smh
I dont usually eat in the morning, but watching this made me hungry for this recipe. I can definitely see myself doing this.
First of all ... Congratulations! 💍💍\nSecond .. That miso looked ammazzzing\nThird... To get all the benefits of miso you should only add it at the last minute and don't let it boil.\nBon appetite 🍜👌🏻
this looks great! i've been wanting to get some koji from japan  (natural import company http://www.naturalimport.com/ --it's where i get ume vinegar, tamari and toasted sesame oil, etc.) but i wanted to try the korean method where they don't use koji, it takes a year and you get soy sauce and korean miso: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGhKwCq7SZk
I can easily make this vegan, thanks!!
All of Europe is pretty chill from where i visited. America only seems to be in a rush.
There is more people in that one shot than at my entire wedding, is that sad? :P
Went to Spain. Sucked being black.
where is the other bloke?
congrats on your wife achievement unlocked :)
just want to make sure if this channel will keep on going well.... since you and Josh now seem to have other things to work on separately
I got assassinated in the comments by your subscribers just for mentioning homeless people in Denver. I'm unsubscribing. Not the kid of people I want to associate with. Hope you have  a wonderful experience here in Colorado though. 👋🏾🙏🏻

Come to Sherman Oaks and do a meet and greet :)
We(I)love you Too)\nI want to spend you time with pleasure !
Wicked! Have a fantastic Time.
You are pretty cool not gonna lie
Disneyland is in a Orange County, not L.A. 😉
I WORK AT DISNEYLAND AND I DIDN'T SEE YOU!?!? *cry emoji*
Everyone has their OrGazmic places they like better than anything else. I was forced into that interpretation because a place CAN'T be an Original Gangster. Be careful in LA, it's really stupid.
Hey I live in California!
im going to cali for the first time in january, im super hype
You made me drool in my sleep yesterday watching one of your videos. I slept soooo good, I lost control of my saliva. Thanks Darling :) ASMR is a skill!
It's neat to see ya in SoCal sun
Hey cutie I live in LA . I can show you around if you want . I am happy you are in my town I hope we run into each other . Sending you lots of kisses in love .
1st timw vloging am so happy am your BIG FAN so much i wach your ASMR......
The one time I'm not in Disneyland🤦🏽‍♀️ hope you had an amazing time!
Yay!!! Welcome to California!! (Although Disneyland isn't in LA, haha!) Hope you enjoy!
she would be a good vlogger
omg her voice is amazing ❤️❤️❤️ nothing what i expected but its cute lol have fun in disneyland!
When u see urself in Taylor's video in the background .......... I can't believe I didn't see her there !!!!
I'm gonna go there in a couple weeks
yes taylor it's sooo tiring hanging out with mickey mouse and the gang ;-)\n\nI'm teasing! hope you have a great time! say hi to goofy for me :)
Dammit!!!! I was just there today!!
Oh wow! She has an American accent.😉
OH M GEE! I was there two days ago!!!!
Disneyland is in Anaheim you dumb bitch
Visit me!!!!!!!!!!!! I live like 10 minutes away from Disneyland.
I will be there in 3 days :) For Amber Rose Slut Walk :) lifting up the ladies!
:D\nI live just a bit south of LA! Omg we're so close!
Everytime I watch your videos at night, I fall asleep next day I fall a sleep in class😂
Do a fan meet up
Maybe a collab?!?!  I can’t wait to find out
I live in Cali, only seven hours away from LA!
going out and socializing?  no, no. Too basic and normie.
You have such an honest personality! Alot of people on YouTube are so desperatly trying to be liked that they start to play characters, while you just seem like a cool girl I'd like to have in my friend-squad simply because you're yourself, which is refreshing to see these days.
Idk but it feels like you were supposed to have a high pitched voice hahaha
Get a churro there! They’re my 2nd favorite place to get churros! (Costco #1 for sure)
HAVE A MEET UP IN LA
omg her voice is so beautiful!!
I'll be stationed at Camp Pendleton  😎
ASMR with normal voice instead of whispering is my request. Any one agree?i would love that. You have an amazing voice
You should get one of those auto graphs booklets because they make good sounds
What a coincidence I'm also in California, been here for the past 23 years😒
Youre so close to me,😀😮😮😮😄
Im always in California all the time, i basically live there, because i live there
Guy behind you: “Yo is that girl vloging?”\n\nOther guy behind you: “Subbed.”
Disneyland😱😱!!! I love Disneyland, we are actually going in September but we can go anytime because we have season passes
Tay! Come to Sacramento, come say hi to us northern californians ^.^
i bet she’s doing a collab with shane
I knew she was going to be a Disney princess someday
Could you do more stuff like this(vlogs) I know it's not asmr but I would love to know more about you
I live in California
You know if you don't blur out everyones face that can have this video removed. Its happend.
When are you going back home?
Wow the castle at Disneyland is so small. I work at Disney World and I'm used to seeing our giant castle.
I'm in LA too! Hope to see you!
Get a pen and press the button over and over close to the microphone so it overpowers the background crowd. Also, if you really want a cool place to do ASMR and have enough privacy to film go to the Huntington Library near Pasadena (open till 4 pm). They filmed Katy Perry's Roar song there and you could actually secure enough privacy to do some triggers at this building on the grounds that was in the opening of the show Fantasy Island. There's cool statues all over and you have to get into the art building where they have Pink Girl and Blue Boy on display. The various rooms in that building have amazing lighting and quiet enough to do some triggers. No flash cameras aloud though. Video is okay. I think it's like $15. Look it up on Google images. I'm doing ASMR next year.
Me i was un Disneyland Paris
:000 I live in California 1 hour away from LA
You should make a vlog channel
It seems I'm the only Russian who translates everything
OMG I NEED TO MEET YOU I LIVE IN CA UR SO CLOSE TO WHERE I LIVE!!
BRUH I WAS THERE LEGIT ON SUNDAY ARE YOU FLIPPING KIDDING ME!!!!!! BRO I COULD'VE MET YOU 😭😭
She a Chicago gal
do a meet and greet in san diego
This means you were five minutes away from me 😞 I can see the Disney Land fireworks from my house so close yet so far!
I LIVE IN CALIFORNIA!!!! LIVE LIKE 45 minutes away from there.
Omg

More subscribers than gentle whispering!

Asmr with mickey??
What do you think? Are you a body with a mind or a mind with a body? Also, we hope you noticed the book rec at the end of the vid. You can download an audio version of the book for free at http://www.audible.com/teded. And for even more book recs from our team, visit http://ed.ted.com/books.
This is what i was thinking about latelyyyy!
So would this help explain alexithymia? I understand how there are two points of view for the same coin, the coin is just methaporically cut in half. There is interaction, but it may not be correct, def overwhelming though. Watch videos of the blind seeing, imagine feeling nothing and then everything...
Okay, on my way to get I, Robot from Audible.
Surface grant convey conduct partly something point better rest tend.
So we have 7 senses, then?
This is perhaps the most thought-provoking video I've ever seen.
If there's ghosts we have a soul
Good vid!! Relatively speaking in Buddhist philosophy the mind and body are connected, the mind affects the body vice versa. From the ultimate view in The Middle Way The true nature of mind is beyond the body, beyond birth and death. This is the mind that can disconnect from the body at death but still be experienced. Some call this big mind emptiness or the ultimate dimension. Follow me IG @meditateforawareness or FB Meditate For Mindfulness.🙏🏽✌🏽
Im 0% sure of anything. But Id bet my top and bottom dollar we're minds with bodies.
Wait, isn't it expensive?
On first one, it is just a reaction, as other hand is getting a treat as your hand and when they get out knife, you expect it will happen to your hand also.... if you didnt move, it would be like watching someone beating people around you and you just stand there thinking they wont do it to you too.
There is only electrical plasma moving through space....The constantly changing  location of the moving plasma has many different pathways of possibility.....The pathways of movement are holding quantum information.....The information is coded and activates according to power flow.....The universe one day stopped and activated the Earth universe....The moving plasma didn't let the universe go....The plasma is still and pulsing through the Earth Universe's data....The visuals that are released by the Earth Universe location in space; form us all.....The pulsating of the plasma causes our lives to become alive...When the plasma stopped to embrace the human universe; it no longer moved forward......The pulsating took the place of forward motion....Forward motion allowed the plasma to take glimpses of many worlds quickly and temporarily.....Once the plasma grabbed the Earth universe location; it began to pulsate with power forever and no longer only took glimpses at worlds....The Earth universe is presently under extreme examination.......The living universe within the plasma; uses the pulsation power for light and usable electricity.....The light produced is what the plasma uses to see us....God is that bright powerful light that's produced by electrical plasma.....Imaginary particles come to life when God or intelligent electrical plasma; actuates it.....Actuating the invisible information of space produced us all.....The mind is really the streaming data that's connected to our Earth's present space location.....Were the pulsating electricity to stop moving we would be frozen still.....Forward movement of that electrical plasma; would leave us behind in darkness.....The mind is always one vibration of universal movement ahead; hidden as program information.....The invisible space information is NON-SCOPIC; reaching deep beneath the Planck scale sizes...A simple magnet constantly reaches into non-scopic space and actuates very small universe's.....The connection between the unseen and electricity is eternal....Humans represent a real life book world's inhabitants; the characters of God's imagination............cJT
I think the chicken came first
And then there are people with multiple personalities, do they have more than one 'consciousnessess'? It has been reported that personality 2 can 'live on' while personality 1 is 'present'.\nWhat if this was not considered a disorder but a secret sign of a bug in our matrix universe? lol
I love these quick, total body workouts that are paired with songs. The slow motions kill me but are the best
Trust me all. This is me. The real me.
2:30 God has fingernail polish
What a sweaty hand
Wow Serial Experiments Lain much??
I love how consistant this video is in the animation style is
To friends your a body, to good friends your a mind
A spirit - that has a soul (mind, will, and emotions) - that is housed in a body
watching this while doing my research report at 3 am aint good for my sanity.
WE KNOW SO LITTLE!
No I'm Patrick.
You can't transfer your consciousness into a computer or any other device and still live simply because if i killed your body you will die your mind will only work in your body\n\n\n\ni think
*A E S T H E T I C   M U S I C*
I am neither my mind nor my mind..be coz there is no I..IF U UNDERSTAND THIS U R ENLIGHTENED! !!!!!! :D
Yes the mind and baby are related...it is what makes us like or hate or love a taste of something for example.....I love ❤️ chocolate 🍫 so much but really hate cheese 🧀....I don't think we are robots....because we are not, we are humans with feelings and conscious awareness that help us decide what we like or don't
We are just piece of meat, everyone with its own brain the conflict should be between brain and mind
Problem with the rubber hand illusion is that since whatever happens to the rubber hand also happens to the real hand would make the individual believe that whatever happens to the rubber hand will happen to their own hand. So when they flinch it is because they believe their own hand will get stabbed and not because the rubber one did.
I believe we are mind with body .. astral projection people  or  who experience out of body will agree with that
The feeling of having a body doesn't go away even if you lose pieces of it.  Your example of not being able to imagine away your body could easily be used as evidence that the body is inconsequential.
I'm a soul within a phisical thing (the body and the mind )
Thank you for this insightful video...
1: I am a mind with a body for various reasons. But on what basis did she conclude that in no way can my mind be physical either?\n2: uploading your consciousness to a computer will only create a copy that you’ll never get to experience, which means, the ‘’you’’ you’re concerned with will still die anyway.\n3: I don’t mind some mysticism, but making definitive assumptions not backed by any logic and then presenting them through a credible channel will only confuse the growing number of science enthusiasts..and the world is pretty complicated as it is!
Or a complex organism that has gained conciousness thanks to years of evolution\n\nBut not evryone believes in evolution.  \n\nAnd also, if you are someone who holds religious beliefs, than you most probably believe in having souls that are separate from your body.
It doesn't seem such a difficult question to me. Given the correct environment our brain should be able to exit with consciousness intact. I imagine it would have to be a very confusing, abstract experience with no outside stimulation whatsoever. I would think the parts of the brain that receive, process and react to stimuli would either become overactive or degrade, possibility both over time. The question would be how much awareness or consciousness relies on the outside stimulation. Would a mind separated from all else imagine the world because of a continued awareness of it or would it's awareness be completely confined to itself? Would the world cease to exit to the mind? Would any change be due to down regulation of function in unused areas of the brain or a psychological reaction to being completely cut off from the world? Would there be changes in the still operational parts of the brain, increased activity or even growth? Would the brain eventually stop functioning completely?
Think of a wireless monitor.  That is, a monitor connected to the CPU wirelessly.  Now let's say we stick some cavemen into a some place full of wireless monitors.  Eventually they might figure out that when they click on the keyboard stuff appears on the screen.  They might also try doing arithmetic and see that the computer prints the right answers.  Obviously, they don't know it's wireless or even of the concept of wireless so they'll assume that the monitor is doing everything by itself.  They might then experiment with it and see that when they cut one wire, the keyboard doesn't work.  Cut another and the screen turns off and so on.  They might get to the point where they pretty much know how it works and can even repair damaged monitors.  But they have no idea that the monitor is only the output and input system with a hidden CPU doing everything behind the scenes.\n\nThat's from the game 999 and was used for something else but it has some interesting implications when applied to this.  What if our brain is that wireless monitor?  Our brain isn't doing anything, it's just taking in information, giving it to some invisible entity, and then displays everything through the body.  Everything we know about the brain with chemicals and electric signals might just be how it outputs and inputs information, not necessarily how it's dealing with it because something else is in charge of that.  It's an interesting thing to think about.
The animators have outdone themselves and created the best animation this channel has ever featured!
Did i eat mom's spaghetti. Or did i lose my chance to glow?
we are spirit, soul, and body
I am a spirit in a body.  The mind is contested for by the body and spirit.
I think we are a mind with a body, but not in this explanation of non physical idea... I think the mind is something very physical; its neurons, transmitters and energy, in between substance which makes the brain, and this creates the mind. We can, in the future, map this 100% and transfer the exact functions to a computer, and then we would be there instead. But the moment that happens you have two of the same person?... yes ofc. And in that moment the two will think a like, but the future from that moment will shape them differently because of their different positions of perception and so on. I dont think its more too it than that actually. Would love to hear input on that thought thou =)
The question isn't if we're a mind with a body or body with a mind - it's rather if conciousness appears in in the brain/and/or body or if the mind/body/world appear in conciousness.
I think its both but what do i know
I'm not the body I'm not even the mind
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Basically, *Nothing is true, everything is permitted*
The mind is something science can never answer. How can you produce thoughts in your head from nothing? What about the dreams you have in your sleep. Science cannot answer this.
Thought is itself the thinker. Without thought, there is no thinker. Therefore, I am who I think I am.
I lost all interest before 90 seconds.\nDid my mind leave the body?
We are but an aspect of the universe with the sole purpose of experiencing itself. My mind and body are no more cohesive than a rock upon the ground and a speck of dust within space. We just exist. We just are. Every bit of your physical matter from the day you were born to the day you have read this has been completely replaced by new materials taken in from your surroundings. You aren't even you; YOU don't exist, WE don't exist... Nothing exists. Stop looking at everything as separate things and begin seeing everything as one hyper-massive singularity.
Really what I think that ever thing is real its not illusion because if it was then it would be there for not to be in any facial way of doing that if there no existence of anything and no existence then that will be only a mind just with a body because you know how you can touch sense and hear and feel and emotions and we see I think that's real the trees the grass the skys the clouds the air the animals the Critters/bugs being in my house at school seeing other people the tv the laptop the world.I know this doesn't have anything to do with this I think and I be live there is a god because who made us because there's no possible way that we can just come on the earth there has to be a crater of making the galaxy of space and the earth the sun the moon the solar system the stars the people on earth the ocean the land the ground the dirt more dirt um stuff that's on earth.If even there for if god made us just have illusions I don't think.
I agree but only to a certain point. I feel like you misunderstood & misrepresented what a soul is in religion.
Are you a peanut with a shell or a shell with a peanut?
This video us exaclty what my brain been going through for 20 yrs of my pufe. just more scientifically explained.
It’s funny I actually just started reading this book and recently got to Susan Calvin’s interaction with robots
Here is the rear question does it matter?
There is no past, and there is no future. We live in the now. The past is just a remembrance through thought. The future is just an expectation without reality. Our bodies are similar to this. Our bodies are created to be perceived by our mind. Our mind is created to experience our body. However, the two will never meet. They just “are”.
We are both and neither.\n\nThe body is simulated at the quantum level. \n\nAnd so is the mind. \n\nThey are one in the same yet nothing at all. \n\n0110100101011
This video seems really depressing
How such would one be if the child you were testing on was neither played with, looked at, or talked to? Would that change anything? How would you know if that one child was a mind with a body, or the other way around?
If we are just a body, then can we still give life meaning? Do we just work our whole lives just to see our personal progress erased after we die?
I'm a mind with a body. I view everything as a picture as 2D, 3D perception feel has vanished for me, sometimes there's moments were whatever I'm looking at I question myself saying Is that really there? Is it? I don't know then continue on with the day. As long I feel like I'm in control I'm fine with that.
It's obvious isn't it? We are Sims. ._.
Mind-body dualism is a bad idea.
this video is more than a useless thing
My mind's telling me no but my body is telling me yes
We are spiritual beings experiencing  reality in physical bodys.
I used the TED-ED Lesson tool and it was really interesting for me! I just made a lesson regarding the relation between climate change and earthquakes. Go check it out at https://ed.ted.com/on/zhLafQAt\nRESPONDER
I remember when I was a kid and I used to think about this too much. I always wonderer why me was me, why my body was mine.
(Before u read this, u should know I'm coming from a very atheistic point of view. So if u love Geezus or any other god, u probably shouldn't read this or u might get triggered.) On one hand, we are absolutely insignificant in the cosmic scale. Physically we are minute when compared to the billions of planets, stars, and galaxies in the universe. Our bodies are extremely fragile and could've only came to be through perfect circumstance. Our minds can be easily tricked and because of our senses, we never really see our world how it truly is. Be that as it may, we are literally the eyes of the Universe looking back on itself. Through the right evolutionary processes, we have come to be on this little space rock we call home. We can see and hear the world around us. We can attempt to understand it through scientific means and learn new things everyday. We can connect with each other and feel beautiful emotions like happiness, contentment, and love. Even though these are creations of our minds, they are still very real to us. I feel very special yet humbled by these thoughts. We should appreciate and enjoy life. We should love and help one another. We should value life but always keep in mind that when we're all gone, our energy will just flow on.
S H O O K E T H
This gave me a headache
OH stop, we dont have spirits or ghosts inside us! we're all matter.
We are just a small bundle of carbon put together randomly, inside a vast galaxy. Which our lives or thoughts mean nothing.
I think they were high when they made this video.
What about people with split personalities?
Mind with a body
As soon as you bring up the evolution, I swear

Well yeah , but like , example for the rubber hand experiment.  Aren't we flinching to the people who got accidents?

Now million of Indian will lose there job as a driver
I'm a Saudi Arabian girl and it's not your fucking business America we do whatever we want whenever we want  so\nshut up!
Congrats women of Saudi! You deserve the right to drive in your country..
Watch every Saudi woman pack her kids up and drive out of that shit hole country.  Thats why they cant travel without a male guardians permission is because Muslim men know these women would be gone. I hope all the Saudi  women run till they stop in a western country. Congratulations,  welcome to 2017!!!!!
Somehow, I don't trust this. It seems unlikely a strict religious based area like Saudi Arabia  would do this. I'm glad they got the right, but I can't help but feel something is up.
Now that they have been granted permission to drive, maybe the ministry will allow them to wear something that enables them to see where they are going.
Am not happy with them
That's cool they should have been done that it's 2017 kinda scary sometimes in the USA driving next to someone with a mask on their face
I thought they were camel riders??
Its not the 20th century, its the 21st XD Fox looking stupid while making other people look stupid, double stupidd
Wow, this is HUGE!
Sigh... i expect sooo many car accidents
Its the beginning of the end for saudi arabia .... first, it starts with a simple right for women, then it grows into a demand for full equality between the sexes, then it becomes a demand that men give up their privileges while women keep theirs, entitlement comes next, then the victimization complex, then feminism and man hating ...... unless saudi men man up mid process and put an end to it by putting women back in their place, believe me saudi men, once you give in to women's demands and nags, then you will never see the end of it
Any ideas on how to deal with women drivers on the road?are they good/bad drivers?i need to prepare myself for the worse
Happy Independence day Women
Saudi government must make a separate lanes for women\nWe all know how women drive cars
big mistake Saudi........they will become whores and feminist sluts now

we. are. truly. FUCKED. NOW!!!!!   whatever happened. to. what. GOD. said.  about. women. driving....teaching... going. to. school....working....THINKING.... self. pleasuring?????
Women for Pity's Sake Don't Drive. Lol\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEEWWTV8Xbg
about fucking time you joined the rest of the CIVILIZED world saudi arabia. now if you would stop acting like scum beating your women and covering them up like ghosts and murdering the people of yeman that would be nice as well
All this time women weren't allowed to drive cars in Saudi Arabia, but they were allowed to fly planes. Funny.
Imagine a car accident happening between a man and a woman, they would kill the woman for trying seduce the man and provoke sexual connections with him.
Now all Saudi guys pay a Lambo Aventador to their wives (or Bugatti Chiron)
For a transition period the husband with a flag must walk in front of the woman driver.
God created the heavens and earth for Islam - to see who will believe , do good deeds and earn his mercy to get paradise and eternal life . If you are completely ignorant of Islam , that might save you from the hellfire although he still expects kindness from all,  whenever possible.
Hahaha.. They can leave home without being beaten? How progressive of the religion of peace! \nWhat a fucking joke this fossil goatfucker country is.
only if her harem leader allows it
sand ninjas are allowed to drive now?
now i know nxt year No Driving License for Expats Salaried below $800..very nice
Amazing news!! Congrats to all women in the Kingdom. You can find out more here, too: http://l.expatwoman.com/saudiwomenallowedtodrive
The accident rate will climb. How can they drive correctly when they are wearing a blanket over their heads. Add the sunglasses and all they will be able to see is forward. Turning their head will be difficult.
If they want to drive I don't care but I'll not let my family female  member drive car
Finally after all this years Thanx King
As long as they don't get the right to vote.
OH Sweet heart - now we can meet to park my car in your garage!  Change oil and filter as often as revenge!
When will Saudi Arabia grant freedom of speech to other religions?
Well that's progress, now if they really want to show that they're evolving beyond what all other nations have, they should ban Asians from driving.
Good to see them join the 20th century.
WHOOOO...WOMEN RULE AS DRIVERS...😁😁😁....HURTING OVARIES....LOOOOL....ANY EXCUSE TO SAY TO BAN WOMEN
The Nineteenth century you idiot!\nWestern Women could drive in the Nineteenth century \nEmelia Airheart was flying fucking plans in the Twentieth century and a few in space!!\nHe loves the snippy remarks but is an idiotic thinker😎\nA bit late Saud... let's step over the next line quicker aswell
NNNNNOOOOOooooooooo!!!!!!!!\nIf they do that I'm sending them my ex-wife's insurance record to prove how wrong they are!
if women were that pathetic... then they obviously wouldn't had been soldiers or able to drive! The fact some women do become generals and able to drive means it shows you that women can do it! Men causes the most crimes then women? Does this mean we should kill all men? No lol!
great they just doubled the chances for car bombers over there...  now we're gonna start seeing twice as many attacks on tv....
That won't last long! Can they rape a car?
A step in the wrong direction for the developing world.. ☹
hhhhh harm woman ovaries,stupid religious men can not see woman as a human being that the truth!!!!!!!
In the Driver's license all the woman would look the same with the barka on.....lol
Allah will destroy you all now ! You have gone against his law ! Oh , wait , there is no god , i forgot.
America seems to support Saudi Arabia, who dislikes America, but Iran has encouraged women to drive for decades and appreciates and strives for peace with America.  Why does America always fight the wrong people for the wrong reasons?
😂 good now USA take the right away for a bit
Well now i'll see what people have to say about saudi. Ahhh i love the gulf arab states😍😍. I hate journalism these days...so poor and unprofessional.
#Trump2020
You disappoint me Saudi arabia.
Fucking backwards pos mysogynistic culture!
على زبي  انت والويمن الي تقولها ي معرسس
Freaking we will regret it big time. Women are stupid as fuck when they drive LMAO. Witnessed it during my 7 years scholarship in the US.
Omg
really ✌️
Ooooooooo. Sooooooo progressive. They can drive to gay stoning. How fucking progressive! Eat shit, Muslims.
Who cares
This is normal\nbackward countries are allies of america
This is a major step for the country and for women's rights in the Middle East. But someone needs to tell little ovary hurting fuckeroo die there that you're more likely to get your dick stuck in a toaster while driving than hurt your ovaries safely driving.
It's hard to believe that this still goes on  in 2017  one of those women could  find the cure for cancer  or a new clean fuel       anything is possible
Good for the women we all rights , women have been rights for years keep going
A dream come true we've been fighting since forever
All of you you are stupid and whoever watch the fucks news is stupid. One maniac stupid person said driving effects woman ovaries 4 years ago and you go wipe all saudis with the same brush. Thats plain stupid.
Hi there! I'm a 24 years old Saudi gentleman \nfor the ones who say welcome to the 20th century I would like to say thank u so much we wish u all the best in life as will as in the afterlife
hahahhahahahahahaha
wow..
This is not freeing women!. Next send your women out to work then take of your Islamic dress and then have haram sex then go to night clubs and then they will get you to leave Islam!!! Next they going to get them to leave Islam. Dajjal
ALLAHU AKBAR! Allah is so Loving that he let women drive now. Now women can go shopping for husband without husband having to get up off couch and stop eat kebab flavor potato chip! FUCKING YEAH! 'RABIA
Are so the Arabia mad?a woman crashed into me before and then teabag me dead god the smell. 😂
Head of the religious fatwas Sheikh Saad Al Hajari SAID Women not equal to men, have OLY quarter of a brain, and don't deserve to drive.  So don't do it Saudi Arabia or ur men with full brain will be jobless & useless.. Haha....
لا نسمح بذلك\nلكي لا نصبح مثلكم \nالزنا يحدث في العلن
But please DONT let them vote!!!
Ladies & Gentlemen,\n\nIt is time for Saudi people to be opened to the World because many countries want to invest there and also we foreigners ask to the Saudi government to have freedom of religion, speech, press, think, drive, fuck without being married and many earth things.
Nice job SA! Welcome to 1926!
when can they take the sheets off their heads?
Before they used to say saudi women cant vote saudi arabia is a backward country then women started voting,then they said women cant drive saudi arabia is a backward country, now women cant drive whats next?
CAMEL NINJAS CAN DRIVE NOW WOW
omg please don't let  Women  drive.The Horror
Insurance is about to go up LOL
The first five years of Car Insurance in Saudi Arabia is a nice business opportunity.\nCan't wait for the dashcam videos to hit YouTube. \nIt will be better than the Russian car accidents.
Yeah, only problem, if they run a red light they get stoned to death.
You do know we have personal drivers right? And your telling me we are backwards 😂😂😂😂😂
When we are going to see American women not used as objects in magazines and porn American movies...etc
Allah is gonna be pissed
Must be ISIS, new way to mass murder, allow women to drive.
Glad to see Islam is reforming.
That's really great news to hear. It is a new positive start for every Saudi women. I hope that 2030 will lead to a new prosperous era.
Many men now mock and say that it is impossible for their women or drive \nBUT wake up it is 21 century \nWomen drive and it is not the end of the world \nThey will learn and everything will be fine
my favorite way to visualize a woman driving is them locking the brakes while sliding on ice about to hit the rear of another vehicle while gripping the wheel and saying what'do i do?!? and then...BAM! so she gets out and immediately starts texting on her phone.
who want suck my dick? CNN or Fox news? one of them I will choose
Buckle up.
👉 THIS IS #FakeNews!!!\n👉 NO #MUSLIM MAN WILL ALLOW THEIR WIVES, DAUGHTERS, SISTERS TO DRIVE!!!
By the way, I am from Saudi Arabia and I think that the decision is not useful because every Saudi family have their own drivers
The saudi version of gold diggers stripping to strangers for money doesnt and will never exist. Because saudi women are respectful women...unlike the sexual objects you guys have XD
This episode was great, but I still believe the Sarah Silverman show was the best. She made me laugh out loud, as the kids say. If Norm could find a way to get Sarah and Caitlin Jenner on at the same time I'm sure a television network would pick this up. ---CodyTheKingOfYoutube
54:48 Adam Egret is my hero..wonders never cease
Holy shit this guy can talk .
That atheist debate was painful. If someone like Richard Dawkins was there, he would've died laughing.
You can't say Jay Leno is the best joke teller in the world in front of Norm fucking Mcdondald, i don't care if you are mr. Candyman, you just can't.
i love norm.. but who told him botox was a good idea...?  wow.  sooo   so weird.  brows are fixed and its quite strange.  poor guy
Tim Allen can go F himself!!!
This is the best episode since season 1, I think.
Bring back the makeup girl already!
tim allen went from selling cocaine to doing it
Alex Jones came up with fake news.
I still can`t believe he is dead!
157th in the country lol keep at it norm
Is everything Adam Eget does a bit or is he really a dildo?
Two comments from Tim about Norm feeling better. To what is that in reference?
I miss the old episodes. He used to interview and kinda troll his guests, which in return made some of the funniest and interesting episodes.
So funny at the end
norm tweeted about jim carrey,  maybe he'll be an upcoming guest
How long has this channel been up ?
Did Norm inject Tim with some sodium pentathol or something beforehand? Somebody let that guy get a nap!
Justin Trudeau  was elected because he's legalizing pot and because Stephen Harpers campaign against him was nothing but personal attacks at his age and looks. This made the citizens angry because homie don't play dat shit. Therefore, Prime Minister Trudeau, pretty similar to how Trump was being bullied by a vocal minority while his supporter list grew and grew....and still continues to grow with the bullshit happening in the states.
Steve O'Donnell is such a sweet man. I love him!
just some notes\n-Allen yawns alot, lol, but Norm is obv not boring, Tim tired?  Seems sharp.   \n-Galaxy Quest was hilarious and i laughed my ass off.\n-Tim might be the first to answer Adam Eget's Where do you get your idea's from? \n- I didn't get the Jeff Foxworthy Introduced him to many times, Gey joke. Who said it? \n-I think they all bumped somewhere during the interview. lol but i don't think Norm does drugs?\n-Joke segment is always great!  ..but the commandment doesn't say anything about not coveting her husband's sweet ass! lol hilarious.  \nmL Norm and Adam!
To be an atheist, there has to be a god for you not to believe in. Huh?  It's a nice mind trick. Then Tim talks about magicians without realizing...does magic have to be real in order to not believe in it??? He compares god to magic in an artful way, instead of a more rational & intellectual way. But forgets to realize magic isn't real.
The religious talk was a little rough, but overall a good interview.
Miss the comedy of you two guy's, I want to be able to laugh the way I laughed when Sam Kinison was on stage at the Comedy Store, in the early 1990's, he rarely focused on politics, and mainly focused on FUNNY, Politics is a losing game in Comedy. I Did Know Sam Kinison, and he was funny. I suggest that you two leave politics out of your comedy and just focus on FUNNY. I am not into your politics, and neither was SAM, So just stick with COMEDY and move on. I will come to your shows, but stick with FUNNY.
Very odd comment when Tim says that his daughter is an Atheist.  His line to her is Atheists don't believe in God.  Well there has to be a God for you not to believe in.  That's a ridiculous comment.  Using that logic we can apply it to any mythical creature we choose.  Santa.  Easter Bunny.  Invisible Purple Monkeys that fly.  Or any thought whatsoever, really.  The notion that if we can conceive of a thought, dismissing it due to lack of evidence actually validates its existence, is childish logic.  \n\nAnd Norm is wrong about Dawkins.  Dawkins does not believe in any God.  Dawkins is specifically disgusted with Christians, that's all.  I'm surprised Norm is so confused.  \n\nIt's interesting how illogical people will become when God and eternal happiness is on the table.  As I once had a friend say You may as well believe, because if you're wrong, you'll go to Hell.  I thought that summed up a big portion of believers.  Do they really think God would reward some dope hedging his bets?  At least God would respect an Atheist for having balls.  There's nothing admirable about believing just to be safe.  It's cowardice.  Atheists aren't cowards but a shitload of believers are.
Norm looked bored with some of Tim's stories.
I was curious, where do you get your ideas from?
I saw that interview with Tim and Martin Short on The View...they were promoting The Santa Clause 3.\nIt was positively hysterical.. Martin Short had Tim in stitches. And for some reason, there is no video available. \nAnd kudos to Tim for mentioning the Armenian Genocide. As an Armenian, I appreciate his recognition of that atrocity.
Tim Allen looks like a cock
Kevin Nealon and Tim Allen have yawn a few times on this show. What time does he film?
46:00  but they spell it chaulk.. That is NOT how you spell caulk. What a tool, man!
Conan would be great swap chairs for once he did it with letterman
This is the funniest I've ever seen Tim Allen...
I love when Egret has an actually good joke and it bombs anyway.
I told that same Foreigner joke on my Facebook page. Joke stealer!
I said the word midget in public with a friend and a few strangers and they totally got super quiet and it got awkward. I was only quoting a part of the movie I was explaining. It's what they say in the movie.
lmao that he answered - Where did you get your ideas from? seriously.
Norm you should have Vladimir Putin on and y'all could smoke some meth and discuss politics!
Got does give human beings free agency but if God is good or just, he is under obligation ultimately to punish evil.  God isn't good if he allows Hitler into eternal paradise.  Through the cross God was both able to remain completely good and completely just by allowing Christ to pay the penalty of sin. As a result we can have a personal relationship with a perfectly loving God without his necessary holiness and eternal justice being compromised.  - Both these guys are Christian so cmon fellas, this is Theology 101.  Norm, if you read this I've got one book that's very accessible and will concisely splain pretty much every theological/philosophical issue you need to know.
I LOVE IT WHEN NORM IS IN A REALLY GOOD MOOD.
Allen hated paying taxes to Uncle Sam when comedy club owners gave him envelopes of cash because he never had to pay his share in his previous job- cocaine trafficker .
A surviving SS camp guard would be a great guest.
When is Conan coming on the show?
Omg I just realized Norm has GOT to get Harland Williams on this show!!!
Are you kidding me Allen? I was a philosophy major, and some of the stuff you say makes me cringe. You say, There must be a god that you don't believe in and you think that is a refutation of atheism and your daughter's head is still spinning? Does that mean that there is a magical Santa clause that you don't believe in? Ever consider the idea that a thing might exist merely as a fictitious concept?
All the atheists with their little feelings hurt.
LOL Tim Allen seemed so genuinely surprised that Norm brought up his arrest.
Those are some big time coke dealer glasses
He falls for the 'where do you get your ideas from line.'...lol
Stop with the religious talk. None of the purported logic makes sense and you're too blinded to see the giant holes. Kale. Kale is better. Kale can be measured.
DIDNT GET BUSTED FOR SIX HUNDRED AND FIDDY GRAMS OF IDEAS
He's been the best guest in weeks
I watch for the guests, norm is like a drunk uncle who thinks he's clever and keeps talking to you
When i Was a Child; My father Tried To Explain Tim Allen\nFrom Santa Clause Was Buzz Light Year. I was VERY confused.\nI also Thought Tim Allen WAS Santa For a while.
Another douche-bag guest. Guess I'll skip this episode too, Norm.
I love the fact Tim Allen is so absorbed with himself that he thinks, “Where do you get your ideas?” is a serious question and answers it without missing a beat. Clueless.
Tim Allen is a white-trash ex-con who cheats on his wife.  Not worth your time, Norm.
I love this show.
Greetings from the south of Ireland just subscribed. Very interesting guests on your channel.
29:45 Go to a psych ward, there are tons of people who god speaks to.
Monte Montgomery is one of the greatest guitar players! Cool mention.
That Steve O'Donnell fella is putting out a strong Bubbles from TPB vibe...
Just want to answer the question what did the government ever do for me as comedians?\n\nHey Tim, big fan... love your work. But I ought to let you know that the Government protected your rights. They made sure that you had the right to speak your mind and tell your jokes without reprisals against you.\n\nThey also ensured the rich capitalist society you were raised in, where enough people had jobs and able to have businesses in order to be able to afford tickets to go see your shows. They also run organisations that are supposed to regulate what goes into your food and medicine so that farmers and doctors don't accidentally kill you. They have environmental agents that make sure your water supply isn't poisoned. Make sure you have roads to drive on so you can get to your gigs, to make sure that there's a reliable power grid so that the lights at the gig work. Enforcing codes to make sure that the venue you're performing at is safe and not a death trap.\n\nAll that, and so much more. \n\nIf you don't like all those things being done for you, at the low cost of the Taxes we all pay in the contract that is part of being a society. Maybe move to a country that has no taxes. I mean, you may end up having to do some expensive stuff like hiring bodyguards, since most of those countries are in the middle east... Or Somalia.
Cocaine is a hell of a drug
I like how Tim Allen explains that Buzz Lightyear has no genitalia.
This is pathetic. His carelessness cost people their jobs. Who else but him is responsible?
Surprisingly entertaining episode especially after that garbage Margaret Cho one
i hate adam's haitcut so much
Hiter coined ''fake news''
This was fantastic.
Martin Short, please.
Atheists have their own dogma.
readahead - worst king of blowjob
Who’s Adam Eget?
why does he keep fake yawning
damn hes kinda right but gooinnggg hard at kids
Adam Eget can whack me off.
nice fuckin' hair
Steve O'Donnell brought weed
Funniest Norm show ever. I laughed til it hurt.
That Blue Velvet shirt is awesome
3:34 I fucking died hahaha
Pabst Blue Ribbon!
What a great joke segmen! MISTA CANDYMAN
McDonald looks more senile than norm...al
Victim of democratic crook agenda
JOKES!!! thank you
Tim fighting his yawns is distracting.
I love Tim Allen
Who's Adam Eget?  - LOL
MARTY
Norm exposed Tim Allen as a dim bulb, not funny or smart. He is a Michael Crichton of comedy, makes all the money, but has little talent.
Tim Allen is a little man and a sheep. I bet he also believe the world is round.
Tim Allen is sickly selfish!   I don't go around blaming taxes as the reason I grew up poor. I blame it on the fact that people think they have the right over someone else to own things, land, people, and the future of mother earth!   Who the fuck are you and who the fuck is Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos for example to think they have the right to possess so much more monetary security than others?   I mean REALLY?  why do these people think that they should have so much power.   They worked hard to have what they have.   So the person cleaning doesn't work as hard?  WTF People , it has nothing to do with Communism . What a bullshit argument and shows just how this person Tim is as about as deep intellectually and spiritually as a toilet!
allen - i don't think i should have to pay taxes \nanybody else - how did you get to the club where you make your money?  \nallen - uh, a road \nanybody else - who built it?\nallen - uh, the government\nanybody else - who secures your property against theft, fire?  who secures those of the\npeople who feel safe to travel those roads and spend their money on your act? \nallen - uh, the government \nanybody else - how is government funded?\nallen - uh, taxes\nanybody else - no shit, sherlock\nright-wingers are fucking dumb as rocks\n(i like allen, hes no dummy, but jesus...)
Tim Allen's analogy of god with the magician is almost the argument for why there is no god. Don't say gods not real, because its the magic of life pfft... I'll take the truth anyday and I still want to know how the magician rips the newspaper and  unfolds it. Plus the church is one of the most corrupt organisations on the planet. So fuck religion.
Mel brooks, dave Chappelle, super dave, and Louis c.k NEED TO BE ON THIS SHOW
Atheists don't believe in god.  Well there has to be a god for you not to believe in.\n\nThat is complete nonsense.  I don't believe in unicorns.  Does that mean unicorns must exists?  No, it only means that the idea of unicorns exists.\n\nFurthermore, Dawkins is not just an Atheist with regard to the Christian god, he is an Atheist about all gods.  Here is a direct quote from Dawkins about this exact subject from his book The God Delusion, We are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in. Some of us just go one god further.\n\nI don't know a single atheist who singles out one religion to disbelieve in.
Nice video!
I can probly afford the tissot but not the $1500 Apple watch
But will it blend?
Get an TISSOT and Paste The apple logo... ;) LOL
This is why I watch your channel....TRUST. I trust all of your testings and greatly appreciate you educating all of us to save our hard earned money. Thank you my friend.
I almost saw deja vu when Kyocera beat Apple by miles with the Kyocera Brigadier, while all the rumors of sapphire on the IPhone 6 happened to be false. This is almost similar, only with the [Verizon Wireless] Kyocera Duraforce Pro being the latest one. Speaking of which that sapphire equipped phone will ace that sapphire test as well!!
don’t you think your only scratching the oleophobic coating that protects the glass?
Even OnePlus managed o put pure sapphire on their budget smartphone last year (on the OnePlus 3T) and Apple is cheap enough to not put it on their extremely expensive watch. Congrats, Apple!
It’s very satisfying to see that abomination getting scratched.
hey, i have that Tissot!
I don't like that RED dot.
The issue with using pure sapphire on the Apple Watch screen is getting the corners of the screen to curve back like that. It can be done, but it’s a lot harder to do it with pure sapphire
GODDAMIT YOU COULD HAVE GIVEN THAT THING TO ME
I havent watched all of the video yet.\n\n\nPlease don't scratch the Tissot watch :(\n\nEdit: NOOOOOOOO
Its an apple product, im not surprised a swiss made watch beat it hands down.
omg apple\nyou really are a genius
i hate you, the fact you have the money to buy an $1300 watch and all that equipment to scratch it. Fuck. You.
hurts to see the Tissot getting scratched :(\n\nno one cares about the apple watch
Apple out here finesseing
poor quality Sapphire?
iScam
SCRATCHING THE 130,789$ Apple Air
.................. why????????
Zak please moisturise
how about a drop test to see if these sapphire are shatter resistant?
What Tissot watch was used on the video?
Does anyone know what model is that Tissot watch? I wanna buy it
This hurts to watch
just goes to show you how shitty Apple products actually are. they're made to look nice, not actually be nice, they're literally made to break down after a year
This video was sponsored by tissot
Literally the bare minimum amount of Sapphire needed for Apple to be able to say it’s Sapphire
fuck apple lmao u dont even get what the tell u..
It was heartbreaking watching this 😢
Personally i dont really care for apple products and i think apple as a company can be a bit scummy with their products and prices but im not gonna get all pissy about it because hey its your money so i wont tell you how to spend it
Apple is capitalis they want u money
Steve Jobs is turning in his grave
I feel sorry to the tissot :(
Bro next time don't murder beautiful watches, just a tiny scratch can serve the purpose too. It was hard for me to that Tissot get scratched so bad
I love how chill his voice
Ok, excuse my rant but you know what really grinds my gears? Why the fuck would ANYONE buy a $1300 watch? And not only that, but pay $84 To unlock fast charge ???? Stupid as fuck.
I've got a cheapshit watch from my local grocery\nAnd I'm happy with that
I've seen gore vids on 4chan.org but never cringed as much as in your scratch tests...
Apple did not come up with the first telephone watch .\nThe Chinese made the first telephone watch. \nThis video just show you how Apple is overcharging consumers for a inferior products.
All the Android users watch this video to shit on Apple when they are poor losers who don’t understand the company and why certain versions cost so much.
Clearly Apple continues to sell overpriced and overhyped bs. Oh and BTW, that Tissot watch is absolutely amazing. Thanks for your great videos!
It was hurtful to watch someone scratching that beaut Tissot watch
First, that's no innovation at all. Way behind on the watch as they are on the phone. Very expensive usual products, sold as premium, which I think is only in the heads of the less educated. There is NO premium, as this type of classification is truly different for each individual.\nAs we aknowledge beauty and good taste differently, the same way we take premium under consideration. So just taking those Apple products as premium, just because they say so, it's only a sign a premature brain leaking :) .
The Swiss government wants you for crimes against wristwatches
Think I could get that scratched Apple Watch? Very good video!!! Thank you.
They should have just called it flame fusion crystal  just like Invicta does to make bull shit sound fancy LOL! Dude.. congratulations, you literally stopped me from making an impulsive 700 dollar purchase today on a fucking piece of bullshit when it's not even complete sapphire. Thank god for people like you. I'd like to hire you to work for me lol!
Nice to see the scratch test on the ceramic! How does the black chrome fare?
*The* *bed* *is* *lava* *like* *this* *if* *you* *died*
Fucking piece of shit apple. All apple is a rip off and all people that buy apple are morons.
I have to say the level 6 and 7 I can barely see the phones I would see it immediately?
Does the apple watch have an AR coating? \n\nAR coating is softer than sapphire.
He said it very well.. buy the base model, and you’ll be fine. Don’t hate on Apple because of a watch, hate them for having children build their phones at miserable salaries
Which is the best smart watch you recommend to get?
Appe is saying a lot of lies like this apple watch real sapphire glass
Apple are scum. How can they get away with this shit?
Apple we have indestructable screens that crack if you drop them any higher than 2 nanometers
Tissot should pay you because you just made me want that watch.
basically Apple is still fucking over the consumers and trying to make products as cheapily as possible and sell it as expensive as possible. Get any other brand than apple please people.
Maybe you shouldn't scratch them with level 6+ if you dontn want marks on screen
Omg some of us can’t even afford these things and here he is scratching them!! Ugh I want a apple 3!
The rubber seems to be legit, though. LOLOLOLOL
Can I have any of the watches?
Sue Apple for false advertisement. 1,300$ for that piece of shit.
Damn, I can buy TWO of those Tissot watches and still have gas money in my pocket. Apple is so overrrrrrpriced!
Apple cuts cost and wants more money, Simple is that. Most of iUsers aren't scientist, and they don't care about it.
please make. a video for mi a1
I'm very grateful to you Zack for this amazing channel, Please keep it the same. Don't change your principles or ideas based off money there are only few of good channels left nowadays.. Thanks again.
Get a screen protector and call it a day
i hope you read this comment since you do this kind of test i want you to test the hardest watch in the world rado v10k vs CX Swiss Military Watch 20,000 FEET the hardest mechanical watch in the world
Its hurt to watch that you scratch the Tissot even you know that iWatch will scratch at 6. Tissot will scratch at 8 and testing with pick 7 would be fine, but all the way to 8? You have already proven this before. Spare the Tissot next time.
Apple buys Artificial Sapphire for some company I forgot the name of. Search it on YT there's. Short documentary on it. And I hurt me more of see u scratch Tissot watch than Apple watch

APPLE HAS SOME EXPLAINING TO DO!!
The dislikes are from butthurt Apple fan boys.
Nice video, but could you STOP SCRATCHING WATCHES!!!
Tim Cook and the rest of the Apple team is really mad at Jerry right now 😂😂😂
Apple has turned into yet another purveyor of overpriced, over hyped junk err I mean products. The cult of Mac is a powerful drug. The first computer I used was an Apple II in grade school in the late 70's, this is NOT the same company in any way, shape or form, sad.

An ugly expensive watch
Box = 1000$ Watch=300 XD

You scratched your 300$ Tissot watch for this kinda impure apple watch!??

Hello from Japan 🇯🇵
cheap tricks by apple
Or, save an additional 300 bucks and don't buy an apple watch at all 😊 it's just an extension of your phone anyway 😊
Ur not scratching the tissot Watch dumb cunt until u got to level 8 idiot
Tell you what-  I’ll take the scratched iWatch LOL - no really, I’ll take it off your hands...😀❤️
The highest note (A flat) is at 0:24.\nSecond highest (G) is at 2:36.\nA few other highs:\nF at 0:39 and 2:23.\nE flat (long) at 2:46 and very quickly twice at 1:37 and 1:40.\nC and D (long vibrato) at 0:59.
This was at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. The soprano was 28, not 16. She is portraying a doll, Olympia, with whom Hoffmann falls in love. Sadly, she is only a doll. The opera is Les Contes d’Hoffmann (The Tales of Hoffmann) by Jacques Offenbach. \nRemember kids, there is no amplification in opera. These people have trained, and have loud voices. I love opera. 👍🏻😊
She was not 16, she was actually 28 when she sang that. Jesus Christ, that's a 12 year difference! How can you get something so god damn wrong?! https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/726trh/in_2009_an_understudy_for_a_trained_opera_singer/
Omg! Rachel Gilmore went Viral!!! \nShe is an incredible singer and such a sweet, lovely young lady. I’ve met her twice and and every time she has been so gracious and attentive. May she and her husband have wonderful careers!
Brilliant! Amazing control!
Outstanding!  Nailed it!!!!
my ears are bleeding
OMG\nImagine a sing off between her and *The Diva* (the blue alien chick) from *The Fifth Element!*\n🎶😌🎶
Isnt this the opera song that girl sang from Spain's got Talent? when she acted like the music messed up and started singing Highway to hell???
I would love it if she didn't dress like that, it just find her look....creepy
This is from 2011.....
Dead performance. Opera is just shit

That was a fantastic performance
Is it just me or does the way she dance weird?\nBTW,\nShe's like mariah carey but opera.
Pshhhh...let's see her sing the contra G in Do Not Reject Me in My Old Age. She's got nothing on my boi Chesnokov. 😤😤💪💪💪
Why do people like opera? I can only take so much of women screaming in my ear before I lose it.😬😉
Theres her, age 16\nthen theres me... my best achievement is 100 hours on Mercy in Overwatch
Who’s here from Reddit?
What that mouth do tho
I didn't realize the human voice could resemble a violin so much 🙄
My dog freeked the fuck out when the is came on
She was actually 28, not 16. She mentioned it in the Reddit post.
I dnt know anything about opera but u can tell she is good by everyone's expressions. They all looked amazed.
okay, now its time for her try at the 5th Element Opera Song.
But she isn't 16.
WHAT THE FUCK ARE THESE BORING ASS PEOPLE LAUGHING AT?! beautiful voice btw.
Opera equivalent of Through Fire and Flames in Guitar Hero.
She was 28 not 16 she confirmed this on reddit
Is that actually singing? My ears are bleeding, its worst than that heavy metal where screaming people, but at least those don't use such a high pitch to fuck my ear drums
Bravo! Bravo!! 👏 💐  \n\n* Edit -- WTF!?  This is from 6 years ago :/
her singing is amazing and all, but as a dancer, the ballet incorporated in this is terrible
*people laughing*\nMe- wtf is she saying? Lol
wow she is amazing and her acting is in point I love it thank you for uploading this talented lady video you've got a new fan here
I can't even talk without my voice breaking.
OMFG MY WINDOWS ARE CRACKING....OMG THE BIRD'S HEAD JUST POPPED....AAAAAAAAAH....OMG I CANT HEAR ANYTHING....DEAD
Except she's not 16 at all.
She wasn't 16 she was 28 lol
She wasn't 16 when this video was taken btw, to sing this song the voice has to be at least 20.
All I hear is screaming in a high pitch voice lol my little annoying brother can sing this *makes brother mad*....\n\n\n\n\n\n*brother gets mad screams* and that is how this type of singing was created 😂😂😂
e r o t i c
She usually has black and white hair in the music videos
She did a very good job. What a good voice.  Best wishes to the new young soprano.
Good singer but she scared the poop outta me
This is amazing!!! If I tried those notes I would just be screaming 😂
Wow! Good job lady! She can do that opera singing stuff so well for being a youngling.
Get her for fifth element 2!
Be still my heart!! I'm speechless...
I saw this is music class in school last year.
i'd LOVE to hear her sing Queen of the Night
WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY TIME????
Hopefully she doesn't get a sore through.
This is a reminder that white supremacy is everywhere take this down
U can hear the ppl laughing 😆
💥💥💥 that was you blowing my mind
Dame that's high
She's kind of freaking me out.
Didn’t know opera sounded this bad
26, not 16. She posted her story on reddit (with proof).
Wow just imagine what she will be like in a few years time. An international superstar no doubt.
What are the lyrics to this opera?
When she started jumping up and down I lost it😂💀💀💀
her neighbours must hate her practicing! I use to sing opera in my house 247 lol wow what am amazing voice and talented young lady!! ❤
FYI she was NOT 16 but 28. It takes years to have this kind of vocal control. :)
Why is this making me teary?
Unfortunately, the title is inaccurate, because she said she was 28 at the time; there's proof from the soprano herself. But, what makes up for it is the fact that she was told she was singing in the concert 4 hours ahead of time, which is even more impressive, I think. AND playing with the MET: arguably the best opera company in the world.
SHE WAS 28 HERE NOT 16.  For god sake this channel is so lazy, cannot even get facts right. Regardless of age she is amazing.
This happened back in December of 2009.  Why is it being shown here like it's a new thing?
Mariah Carey, you're nothing now!
The video is years old, why is this only trending now
Report click bait she is 28 at the time of this song.
the green plants + pink chair + blue shirt look so aesthetically pleasing and SO NICE
Do you actually /need/ to get down to fewer than 16 t-shirts? Maybe you do because of limited storage, but I don't think you should put yourself through the stress of getting rid of something you love and do wear just for the sake of achieving an ideal number.
I don't think 16 shirts makes you a t-shirt hoarder at all! You love to wear them, so it makes total sense to have a few of them (and again, 16 is not like a huge amount!). For me it seems absolutely fine to keep all of them, doing some kind of rotation system, or, if you really want to reduce, keep track of wich ones you wear the least ( and if those are the ones designed by your friends, or having some other sort of emotional value, make something else out of them! Like framing one like a picture, or sewing a t-shirt-quilt (i did that, it's awesome!)) Loved the video, please keep us updated! xx
YES LUCY! This video is literally like porn for me X
A channel that you might like all about fashion, focusing particularly on capsule wardrobes is Justine Leconte Official. She's a french fashion designer and her videos are super duper helpful!!
I'm currently working on refining my wardrobe ~ I'm slowly donating or passing onto friends (my local charity shops love me 😆). Autumn is just about a big oversized orangey - maroon jumper with black skinny jeans or leggings and a black or burgandy pinafore with tights and boots for me.
I need to do this. I'm moving soon and need to cut down significantly. I have clothes in my wardrobe from 10 years ago and items I've never worn but kept just in case and about 70% don't fit me. I need even less clothing than you do as I wear a uniform to work. So I need 3-4 outfits a week and the rest of the time I'm in pjs. I'm gonna get planning
Try to consider the maintenance of pieces you want to get or pieces you already have. I find it a lot more difficult to wear certain items of clothing because they require more maintenance than some others that get worn almost regularly. \nAnd also, about the 16 t-shirts, just go through and see what really flatters your body type. That applies to all your clothing, anything that doesn’t flatter or make you comfortable should automatically go into storage, because your daily wear (even formal wear) should be 100% the most comfortable stuff ever ever for you (whether physical or mental comfort).\nCheers 💃🏼
This makes me want to go out charity shopping, which I love doing. I may use the excuse of 'needing black work trousers' to go do some soon!
I love your comments about mom jeans because I thought I was fooling myself into thinking they were just not suited to my body. Ahh I feel so much better now!!
lovely video but i'm just lowkey crying because here is Spring not autumn
Can you do another bullet journal video?
I make all of my own clothes because that avoids the human exploitation/sweatshop element of lots of popular brands, and also makes me think carefully about what I really need. This season I'm making black jeans, a grey blazer and a colourful blazer, a nice black shirt, and some leggings for layering.
I love your style! I am someone who also tries to keep my wardrobe down to versatile items but there are one pieces I own which are fancier and can only be used for nice events but I love them so I don't mind that they are less versatile! You do you, I don't think it's a bad thing to have lots of tshirts if you love them- just store them away because you might regret getting rid of them in the future☺️
Hey people, would you mind checking out @ThinkingOfThing on Twitter? My goal is just to make this dreary world a bit more positive :))\nThanks so much xx
Great advice! Shop currentandcompany.us to find high-quality, affordable pieces for your capsule wardrobe!
I started this process last night! So timely!!
i swear if i had more money/freedom i'd be drowning in socks, jumpers, skirts, sundresses, sneakers and i'd have a wide brim hat that's actually big enough for my damn head
you said scarfs at one point  - are there styles or colors that you're gravitating to there? winter is coming ;-)
Storing some of the t-shirts sounds like a great idea. That really appeals to me because rotating them out rather than downsizing outright should help them all last longer, which has started to become an issue for me in the last couple of years. So for t-shirts, I think it makes a lot of sense...because you can wear them, preserve them, and have a streamlined everyday wardrobe, all at the same time.\n\nI definitely need to downsize my wardrobe, but most of that is things that don't fit but I really want to fit into again sometime in the future. And things that are redundant from living at uni _and_ at home.... I think this might actually help me? Which is just unexpected because I'm not a woman and I don't really buy clothes. ^^;;
For tshirts, something that I have done (which isn't for everyone) is made them into a quilt! My friend took my shirts and made them into squares then makes the back out of fleece and for me it's the perfect mix of keeping sentimental shirts but paring down my clothes
I wear a uniform for work, and work three to four days a week. on days I work I dont do anything else (ie, no need for real people clothes on those days) so I really only need 3-4 outfits for every season. realizing that was pretty much life changing.
How do you accidentally buy something?
Love this! Planning my capsule wardrobe now😂 x
if you like capsule wardrobe and fashion channels i recommend justine leconte. She is a french designer who makes quick and concise videos about fashion and one of her series is about capsule wardrobes.
Oh my gosh! WHERE is the pink coat from? ❤️❤️❤️
Have you considered making something like a quilt out if your t shirts you adore but don't necessarily want to wear constantly? Like a t shirt quilt or tapestry? Combine textures and other squares that go with your t shirts into a quilt type thing to snuggle with or hang in a room? Just a thought!
please do a lookbook once you have it organised x
Damn trending Lucy!!!! Wooooo, such a great video so highly deserved x
what colour are you getting nathan zed's tshirt in? (sorry if its a weird question but i was curious if it goes with ur colour scheme)
Could you do a video abt fuckboys part II? im living for those
It would mean the world to me if your could subscribe to my channel!! Xx 😘
Pls pls pls can I beat my brother In a bet and get 100 subs in 2 days xxx
A big mistake a lot of people make when doing capsules is that they discard items that do not fit into their capsules. If you are not feeling hot pink right now - put them away and in february, check if you are feeling them for early spring, for example. If you like an item but it does not fit into your capsule *right now*, it might in a year or 5. I bougth a pair of trousers in 2014 that fit perfectly with my FW17/18 capsule... It takes time to find what fits you so you are bound to experiment along the road.
i love this video & i don't really know why
Lucy, I tend to have the exact same problem with wanting to keep sentimental t-shirts. Sadly, because I have a shorter torso, normal shaped t-shirts look really weird on me because they are either too long or too bunchy, so I never get around to wearing them. But I still really want to preserve those memories. Ive found online that some people turn their old t-shirts into quilts! You can still enjoy all of the memories associated with them without having to actually wear them. Maybe that is a possible solution to your t-shirt problem?
Hi Lucy! I have a few questions :) when you build a capsule wardrobe, does it work for all seasons? or is it like okay this is my capsule wardrobe for winter and this my wardrobe for spring? I've seen people limiting themselves to a number of pieces (like 52, 30) and I don't know if shoes are counted in too. Loved the video, I'm looking forward to the next one! :)
I used to exclusively wear jeans as bottoms, but then I watched Begin Again and Keira Knighley's effortless and supercool way to pull off smarter trousers opened my eyes to a whole new world. Check it out, Lucy!
where's that gorgeous pink coat from?!😍
With the T-shirts, have a weekly or fortnightly rotation. You'll find you wear those you often don't reach to more often without having to scale the collection down!
If I have too many items that I love but they won't all fit in one wardrobe rotation, I store them then at the beginning of the next season I'll swap out the ones I really love, and if there's any I'm not keen on wearing/haven't worn at all THEN I'll donate them, that way I know I won't wear them and I feel less guilty about it :)
Who says you can't wear all black all the time? lol. \nThis is a neat idea. I'll be interested to see the final result!
Lucy be careful of making rules for yourself. It's your wardrobe, if you want a secret 3 bright pink things, then do that. There's no rules if you think about it.
bro i couldn't get my eyes of her frickin lips i feel like a bird ~sHi~Ny~~
PLEASE do a look book
I get if you want to wear them, but you could always frame a t-shirt or two that your friends designed.
i think you're putting unnecessary pressure on yourself about the amount of things you can have. i'm the same way with my tshirts, and that's ok. if it's something that brings you joy, or you feel good in, or means something to you... keep it! and don't pack them away! you love them and you'll wear them, so they get to stay. don't worry about it so much.
Excited for the sequal of whatever this is :)
i have the same problem with t-shirts! i have so many that have sentimental value to me and for that reason i'm not willing to part with them, but at the same time i don't wear them as much as a person with a ton of shirts should! i've been thinking of making a t-shirt quilt out of them, bc that way it's clearing out my closet, but i still get to keep the t-shirts around in a useful way.
If you could get someone to send them to you, I feel like you could live in these pants https://www.everlane.com/products/womens-italian-goweave-easy-pant-black?collection=womens-bottoms
This video has inspired me to do something about the explosion of clothes in my room, so thank you! haha Also I love the way you organised the whole thing starting with what you regularly do and what outfits you need for those things and going from there. Maybe I will reach that point in my organisational skills someday lol
Have you considered making a t-shirt quilt? You still get to keep the designs and the memories they bring without having them take up much room in your closet
It's 30+ degrees weather over here in Toronto dont ask me how
Not a very interesting video,
I have Nathan Zeds good enough t-shirt in the post too 😂
your style is absolutely stunning, you inspire me so much
is a jumper like a sweatshirt/sweater?
if you love them keep them! It's all about having stuff you love and will actually use, not just getting your wardrobe down to a specific number.
u should put some of th ones u dont rlly wear on depop !!!
Fab video! I feel like it would be a bit more engaging if you did some b roll of what you're talking about & the process!\nLoved the video and I hope there's more capsule ones to come xx
I would recommend to be flexible about the item number or pieces. If you really like and use tshirts you don't need to get rid of them just to fit in the capsule wardrobe standard. This is a really marvelous concept but I think one should adapt it to it's own needs and taste. Good luck!
It's so refreshing to see a practical take on reconfiguring a wardrobe/closet! I had to do this when I started my job several years ago and now I like to think shopping is a matter of plugging in holes and thinking carefully before making purchases (my impulse only seem to be things I've stalked for months or years).\n\nI also have had your problem regarding the fit of pants and jeans and learned that a good tailor completely solved the problem so am so happy you've sent some stuff off! I had the same gaping waist/sagging crotch issue and the tailor made them fit perfectly each time. It's annoying that so many pants/jeans seem to be constructed in a way that do not accommodate normal hips, but I'm grateful to have a good and decently priced tailor around. A good cobbler is also life changing for maintaining shoes and boots!
Not to give away my secrets but if you want recommendations light before dark is THE place for semi casual trousers
I love the idea of a capsule wardrobe but it seems like so much work, plus I'm at university so I have zero money for clothes. Your capsule wardrobe so so nice, you should some fashion videos once you get it all sorted. X
Since you have good music taste, what's your opinion about this good track, Lucy Moon?\nThe Midnight - Crystalline\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4iLX7eWwmE
i think with your t-shirt problem you could keep them all at least for a while and even switch them up during the 3 month capsule cycle. this way it might help if you ever get the feeling you want to buy a new t-shirt. cause then you can just go the ones you already own and switch things up. even old stuff feels like new when it's been out of your sight for awhile. after awhile i'm sure you'll notice if there are ones that you never really feel like including into your capsule. and then it might be easier to get rid of those.
wow i'm such a  t-shirt hoarder as well 😩 this vid has kinda inspired me to do a t-shirt clear out this week hahah
I just love people talking about style/clothes
I got so many jumpers on new looks sale page! have a look :)
Could we switch parts of our wardrobe, I have WAY too many jumpers (around 20...) but not that many basic t-shirts.
if your looking for good quality more affordable jumpers try pull and bear x
I really like the way you structured this video. The information is specially well divided and chosen in this one. I'm not sure if this was intentional, but I so bloody appreciated it.
Love it! So captivated by the idea of a capsule wardrobe... thinking I might need to give it a go!? xoxo, Caylie
100% backing this idea!! It's so good for the environment and your creativity 💕 also, can't wait for hauls and lookbooks. And I would recommend a cashmere jumper as one of your three purchases, they are a god send 🙌🏻
omg but where is the pink coat from??
Yesss I really needed this! Looking forward to the next video :)
First I want to say I LOVE YOUR T-SHIRT!!!!1 I just brought myself a pinafore and im in love with it!!!! \nAlso, id love to see an overview of your bullet journal!!!
loved this vid!!!\nif you don't want to get rid of t-shirts, but don't want to wear them, you could make them into tote bags or cushions so that you get use out of them?
lucy i love this kind of video! having a curated wardrobe is so appealing to me. would love if you showed more of the items or made a full video showing all of the clothes in your autumn wardrobe later in the season! also would really love a video about your bullet journal <3
Get your sweaters from boohoo. I got two maybe 3-4 years ago, payed them 15-20 euros and they are still as good as new.
Try the pureple app, its a wardrobe app, you add photos of your clothes which helps you keep track of what you own, you can create or be suggested outfits and that helps to see what you actually wear or not, ive had this app for years and i swear by it
I'm sure someone has already said but what about making a blanket out of your excess tshirts? Pinterest will have great examples no doubt!
I've learnt about capsule wardrobing from Justine Leconte (she's an incredible fashion youtuber, definitely recommend) but I've been waiting until summer to do my capsule wardrobe for two reasons: firstly, Australia doesn't really have 4 seasons.... autumn and spring just consists of alternating summer and winter days or weeks (it's not a stable temperature), and secondly, I'll be finished with my uni semester in November so I'll have more time to do it. I also have a new wardrobe which I don't have the space for so when I start sorting through my clothes, I'll ditch my current one (and maybe my clothes rack since I have no space for it) and buy a small chest of drawers.
This has inspired me so, so much to try out a capsule wardrobe. Your tips were so helpful, Lucy. X
I've been working on the same thing! I'm the same way with t-shirts. If they're graphic tees you can hire someone to make you a t-shirt quilt. I had it made with all of my school shirts and memories and things I was holding onto. The back is lined in fleece and it's super cozy! Could be a good way to keep the memories of the shirts but turn them into something new :)
I miss your discussion videos
looovvveee this so excited to see the result <3
i'm debating whether or not to treat myself to a new pair of doc martens next month... my current pair are over five years old and were mistreated throughout high school, so there are holes in the heels and the leather is all cracked. i'd love a new pair but i'm not sure i'll wear them enough to justify their cost, especially considering they can't function as my winter boots because it's way too cold and snowy where i live. we'll see whether or not i get them lol. i also need to go through my clothes again and be harsh in getting rid of things i don't wear and that don't fit me. i've gained like 20 pounds in the last two years so i have a lot of old jeans and shirts that don't fit at all but are still in my dresser taking up space. that'll be a task for.... whenever i have some time to kill, which lbr is a rarity for a uni student who also has a part time job
Want month faves back! <3
Hell yes to period slobbing clothes!
Whats your haircut called ?
Lovely video, Lucy! <3
Lucy 💕✨🌸
Check out Longchamp for smarter trainers!
Hey girl! If you're shopping on the high street for mom jeans it's almost impossible to get a good fit, my tip would go vintage or second hand, the quality and fits are way better. I usually go for the men's section and get a levis 504 or 505 but it's really about finding the best shape for you, I'd also size up one or two sizes as the denim is mostly non stretch. Just thought it might be worth a mention because it can be really hard to have jeans tailored in a non obvious way, so excited for this project!!
Does anyone know where the baby pink fur coat is from? I've been looking for one for two years now and this one looks amazing! Thanks for your help :)Great video, Lucy!
Slippers for around the house are also the best 10 pound investment that you'll ever make
Lucy!! I want to send you a sustainable plain white button down shirt.  What address should I send it to??
get superga's for trainers! v cool but can be formal too xoxo
My little brother never drank milk or ate more veggies than carrots. My mum and i sat him down to explain why he needs to drink more and eat a variety of things (not scaring him, but making him aware of the facts). If he had his 5 a day and a glass of milk everyday for 2 weeks, he was allowed £5 to spend on whatever he wanted. We continued the chart format for about 6 weeks and then we scrapped it as it just became part of his routine! Good luck with it louise!
I feel like Louise is a bit self conscious when vlogging. Maybe that's just me. You are beautiful Louise and I love you very much xxxxxxxxx
Glad to hear this week was better for you Louise x
My five year old hardly drinks, he'll only drink water if it's volvic lemon! God help us when milk stops in class because other than that I'm pretty sure he doesn't drink at school x
Hahahah weekly nail check ins are an integral part of the vlogs! And those kittens are just too cute 😍
I'm on the p.t.a now hahaha Robin?
I can't wait to see how ignorant Dan and Phil are to all this mummy business, thankfully now they have been enlightened.
Louise and Jim always have the funniest conversations
I'm new!\n\nAs in, this is one of my first videos from you!! :D
Try finding a decaf tea she likes without sugar or milk and if it's too hot for tea just ice it :)
Congrats on having a good week!👍🏻
so i dont like drinking milk but so I drank it when i was younger my mum would buy these chocolate milk straws which u can get in b&m and home bargains....there's ones for water too that might help darcey becuase it cookie flavour etc
Your looking really good Louise! Xx
This whole entire vlog was so delightful. Oh  my word
aww, i love how giddy and excited dan gets when he's with louise
I'm a new subscriber to your vlogs. I've also got the audio version of your book that I'm really enjoying so excited to pre order the sequel. Hope you are keeping well x
My sister is about to turn 18 and we still have to nag her to drink more water! :')
Does louise still have her other cats?
I'm NEW! And loving all your videos!
I struggle to get the kids I work with to drink too. I have a box of curly and fun straws for the really resistant children. They're a pain to sterilise but still better than dehydration. We also give a choice between milk or water, so if a child doesn't like water, they have a choice. Putting fruit in (raspberries, lemon etc) can work too for some children.
Dan seems sooooo happy far out!! You do too Louise
Cracking up at the bit about Richard and Judy 😂😂😂
I work in a hair salon that does Kevin Murphy and the salon you went to is by far the most beautiful salon I’ve seen in ages!😍
Omg the shoot footage was so funny! Loved this!!
First let me say that getting involved in your child's educational life is anything but a sad mum alert'. I give you kudos and a gold star on your forehead for joining the PTA and giving of your time and talents to all the children at Darcy's school. Bravo, Louise! \n\nNext, I have to tell you how absolutely gorgeous you look with your no-makeup-makeup look. And even your out-and-about makeup looks seem to have a lighter hand and really accentuates your beauty instead of calling attention to the actual makeup. Love the less is more makeup application. Bottom line, you look absolutely beautiful. Maybe this wonderful week was creating your natural glow. Regardless of the cause, you look amazing!
Have you tried the towel trick with your cats to see if it helps them get on? You just rub the new cats with a towel then rub it on the older cat. And do it the other way. It's essentially just rubbing the scent on them, but it apparently helps them get on because they then recognise the scent so the cats then aren't just strangers ☺️
Please do another book tour for Wilde 2 as I couldn’t come to the last one xx
26:26 made me laugh so much 😂😂 Jim: 'deary me' 😂😂
Thumbing up because I love you, but also for you taking the piss out of Arsehole Madeley! 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽💖
The “bird farm” is a pen for pheasants. So they will be kept in there from young age until they are ready to be released for the shooting season ☺️
I never drunk water as a kid and now I drink it all the time, just put a little bit of juice in it and by the time she's older she'll learn to love it on its own
I'm called Lyla 😂❤️😻
More Louise and Zoe!!!
I'm new :)
Looks like you had a blow out with your tyre!
I'm so glad you've had such a lovely week! ❤️ x
This must be so weird but I've watched Lou for six years now! I bloody love this woman even though we don't know each other in real life and it's a one sided friendship but she makes me so happy and she's one of the most genuine on YouTube today. I know I must sound so creepy writing this but she makes me so happy! Hopefully I'll be able to go to an event in the future.
Lol ...Nutella doughnut SHIT ME! Louise you're hilarious that would be my reaction too! Heaven in a doughnut
The water thing, it's ok!!! If she's thirsty, she'll drink. if she's not getting thirsty all day then she's getting enough water in her food and other drink to keep her going. \nI found that giving my kiddo some water or milk right before dinner was good, or with his snack if i wasn't sure if he was really hungry or just peckish.
The Richard Madeley bit was HILARIOUS!!!! x
I am new. Lol.
my brother is exactly the same with drinking and he's 10!!!
my 5 year old son struggles to drink his water and whats worse is that he only drinks water or hot chocolate. you tell him to drink some and he will take a sip. its so hard . he comes home from school with none drunk too. 😔 x
For your tires, next time check to see if there was any bumps on the side. That can cause blow outs.
I'm currently watching Chesapeake Shores on Netflix and it's so heartwarming and good for my soul
GET THOSE APPS FOR DRINKING WATER AND IT GROWS YOUR PLANT\nI got it on my phone for my sister because she did the same thing
I’m new-ish. I watched you when I was about 12/13, stopped, and now I’m watching again as a 17-almost-18 year old. Started again bc your content has changed, it’s sort of grown with me which is cool! x
I really love the long vlogs!
It was so nice seeing you all together- reminded me of old school YouTube :')
do a rose quartz cosplay hawhaw you fit that role perfectly
You actually get a lot of liquids from foods so it's quite normal for kids who are eating a normal amount to not feel like drinking. I dranks very, very little as a child even when I was playing sports. Also the 8 cups of water a day was mostly made so important by a bottled water company if I recall correctly so that's also a thing :)
ahh louise you're dah best and i can't wait to sniff some fresh content 👌 and i love your vlogs teehee
I want to be a cleaner oh she's so cute. I love that she so badly wants to be in the vlogs too 😂💕 ps I'm loving orange is the new black, need finish the last series!
I don't like donuts... I'm sorry they just taste so weird, especially glazed... The only donuts I really like are completely chocolate ones.
Aw, Dan was just adorable in this. He turns into a kid around Louise, I love it XD
Omggg that tyre thing happened to me on the freeway (In australia about 100kms/hr) and i ended up having a car accident its terrifying!!
When the kids don't want to drink water, I usually told them really excited omg u know what can we do, grab a lime 🍋 I cut it open and drop like 5 drops of lemon, and tell them that bc we put lemon there it's not gonna taste like water, and I'll have a glass with them, but idk 😂
Your weekly vlogs honestly make my day when I watch them😂
I am new! I think you're bloody marvellous though! X
I never comment, but I must know where your lovely necklace is from? The one with the pink stone on the middle! It's pretty! X
Just FYI, I love the long vlogs. They play while I work. I work from home.
ok didnt the whole gang include naomi or no? \nmaybe its me, i just feel a bit weird about that
This video was a crazy mess, just the way I like them👌🏻👍🏻glad to see that you got pep back in your steps. Big Love M❤️
My sisters never wanted to drink and mum got them these water bottles each and it had like lines and tells them when the need to keep drinking and that and then refill and they would get little rewards when they had drank it !! Highly Recommended💓
ok pause video at wilde pre order (tick),, pop on amazon(tick),, pre order book(tick) ,, and continue watching the video,,, (tick)
Im new but I'm gonna be a stayer i just love this
my mum used to color my milk to get me to drink it, just a drop or two of food coloring, might work the same with water? you could even add some fruits and let it sit overnight to give it some flavour (which is the only way i can drink water because i don't like the taste)
you should try flavored water to get encourage her to drink more water
I used to and still really dislike water. It makes me feel ill if I drink it. So I put some sugar free lime squash in it and it makes it easier to drink personally
I Love your Videos with dan and Phil
Louise I love these long videos!! Thank you xx
Louise! Is that poop on your rug at 5:36?! Ha ha ha!!
That's so weird, you guys were literally ten minutes away from where I live!
I'm new to your vlogs (: I love your chats and your pink hair!!
I am new love your videos so much
Dan: Can Phil express an opinion \nMe:Daniel can Phil express an opinion \nXD
Yes my little sister will not drink
My daughter is almost 12 and I STILL have to reminder her to drink water!\n\nI loved seeing you with the old gang, I laughed hysterically...
Make the drinking a fun game! Drink through a straw. Draw lines on a bottle, and make it a game, to get down to the line!
Newww
neww
28:15 if you guys were wondering
Where’s Tanya and Naomi :(
I have only been watching for like 3 or 4 months
The Dublin store is the main store, Primark is Irish ! :)
I love doughnuts but I can’t eat them 👎🏻😞 I can’t eat wheat or gluten or dairy 😭😭😭😭
Oh your living room is the exact blue I want for my new place!! Absolutely beautiful 😍😍😍 Please could tell me what colour and brand it is? xxx
My son's 8 and it's still a battle to get him to drink!! I feel your pain! We've just had a breakfast battle over a cup of water! But he loves fizzy water & will drink it endlessly!  I try and get him to eat lots of things like Celery, cucumber & melons or he could go a whole day without water!!! Xx
My foster sister (mum is a foster carer) battled with my mum for at least the first 6 months of living with us. Then my mum found a water bottle with her name on and ever since then she drinks the full bottle each day. Give that a go? X
Hey so with the water dislike, My mum used to use cordial (natural ones like lemon or pineapple ones), or we had drink bottles with diffuser's in them so we could add things like strawberries or kiwi fruits
Any chance you could do an 18+ meet up? You mentioned it a while back - like cocktails perhaps for those of us who are a little bit older?
Joe not wanting to touch the baby and Marcus tickling Louise is adorable
For Darcy's water intake there's an app called plant nanny. Maybe that's something you guys can do together that will help. Basically it's the cute little app where you log your water intake throughout the day and it waters a little plant and makes it grow and keeps it alive. So maybe you could download it on your phone and she will enjoy coming to tell you when she drinks so she can water her flowers!
What does Louise say at 1:57 hahaha
im new
Meeeeeeee
IM NEW
omg rocket!!!! hahahah couldnt stop laughing
Who is Rocket??
Lol hiiii, I'm newww. :3
Should not laugh but oh boy it's so funny. On a serious note though, the teacher was wrong to sit on the car's bonnet.
Teacher should not have sat on bonnet.. but thats not an excuse to  drive through him!..  He should have been reported not transported!!!..
Teacher acting unprofessional by sitting on someone's property = frustration and retaliation= a sore arse !!
My sympathy was for the Teacher, but when I saw that he sat on the bonnet, that sympathy diminished, no need to be that arrogant.
Teacher isn’t going to do that again, lesson learnt !
The driver should have quickly reversed instead.
Hahaha that’s funny!!! But why did the so-called responsible teacher sit on the mans bonnet??? Surely he knew that would only exacerbate the situation.
Sitting on the bonnet of someone's car is just asking for trouble. A quick reverse would have had the same effect. But we don't think straight when we see red do we!
Haha stupid cunt of a teacher. Arrogant cunt got what he deserved.
He shudda reversed and made him fall flat on arse
I was more concerned about the two kids on their bikes who nearly got ran over by that ass hole
Hi Mate could you give Me a lift to the bottom on the drive!!!!! Yeah Mate SIT on my bonnet an I'll take you there, Just wait a min................. WHAYHAY what a ride OR was that just me with that VID??????? LMFAO BUT that said he did wrong and poss hurt the children
Ive  just seen this on the news! Have they pressed charges against the teacher yet? This is an act of aggression. If he got out and pushed him he would be in the wrong! Try sitting on a police car and see what happens!
Teacher was in Passive Mode (  Noob )
Teacher is a cunt. \nKid that watches then gets on his bike and fucks off is cool 😎😎
guys look slowly the car is going slowly and sir loses balance so he sits on it and a school policy is not to let cars in otherwise there would be thousands of cars and if a kid gets hit the school would be deemed unponsable and closed so look over this one more time 😉
Fair enough that the teacher won´t allow him to pass. But you sit on my car and I will fuck you up. It´s as simple as that.
Holy shit everyone in the comments is so serious, lighten up I found this funny as shit
Hilarious! The best laff I've had in ages!!!!!!!
Funniest thing ever imagine being one of them kids on the bikes  😂😂😂😂
Whether the teacher sat on the bonnet of the car or not is totally irrelevant, the driver was trying to drive through the staff car park as he was too bloody bone idle to use public roads to turn around. So wants to speed through a car park where children are walking. A total danger to society, 22 and in prison. I suspect he will be returning there often throughout his life.
If the teacher had the audacity to sit on my bonnet id fucking give him a test drive too..
Good they shud have reversed and drove over the twat
Doesn't take long for clips to be stolen does it
If the car park is off limits, why not just put a gate on, rather than just having ferris bueler's teacher guarding like some kind of traffic control cunt?
He'd have gotten the same if he sat on my car's bonnet
Serve the jobs worth right😂😂
Move please?!\nBugger off!\nWhy?!\nDo you know who I am?!\nWho the hell are you?!\nI'm Ronnie Pickering !!\nWho??\nRonnie Pickering!!\nWho?!\nRONNIE PICKERING!!
For those people denying the fact that the teacher didn't deliberately sit on the car (which it clearly shows in the footage) but the car nudged him on the bonnet. You are delusional fucks that deny the truth and have never owned a fucking car
Why on earth does science teacher McCarthy sit down on the bonnet of a car? He must know that every action has an equal and opposite reaction! Head of the school Zoe Johnson-Walker seems very keen to completely overlook this - perhaps she has not seen the footage properly......(doubt it). Cynics might say that there is an attempt to manage or conceal any contributory negligence from the school. I do not condone or congratulate the driver. McCarthy seems to have made both himself and his school appear very amateurish.
Humans are garbage. This video is the proof.
Should’ve driven straight into a wall.
He sat on the mans hood .fuk id have .thrown him off my car too then stopped and whipped his stupid ass.
Both are to blame, but the teacher should never have done that in the first place. Should have just let the car in the car park, then ask them to leave once off the main road and not obstructing traffic. Trying to be clever has cost him, could have had a nasty accident if he fell the wrong way too!
Stupid fucking teacher, he looked like a right wolly car surfing
Don't sit on his fucking car then! Cheeky twat deserved it.
the description on this video is very inaccurate... The teacher actually sat on the bonnet of the car, Which in no doubt would have angered any motorist. Serves the teacher right for trying to be really cocky!!
This is my school😂
LOL
LOOOL
✔
guys ye he is a prick but if a 68 year old man dose shit 2 u you don't fuckin run him over 😂 and I herd today that the office said that he should sit on the car . he dose have family and that's like ur grandad getting run over . da fuck what's this about the Jeremy show ?😂
Dramatic footage\nFuck off will yah
I have no problem with the teacher sitting on the bonnet of the car, too many people think they can park and drive anywhere they like. I see this on a daily basis outside our child's school, drivers who don't give a shit and will park anywhere. The teacher obviously told them they could not access this area and they basically refused to move. I personally would not have sat on the car just incase it decided to move, but to have a go at the teacher because he did is ridiculous, what that person did was reckless especially with those 2 kids on bikes being so close to being hit as well. What the teacher did was nothing compared to that driver, yet majority on here complaining about the teachers actions rather than concentrating on the driver. So sad.
Absolutely hilarious that!
why his pride would not let him park where he should and not where he wants .\nDriver decides its ok to risk kids and teachers safety by driving like a prat.\nany one who thinks this was/is ok is a complete and utter arse hole .
Teacher got what he deserved
If the driver waited for traffic to pass and reversed, the teacher would of slid off his bonnet and landed on his ass, especially as he had his hands in his pockets. Not a very good teacher sitting on someone else's car. The car had no insurance or mot and if he did that, I doubt the car driver would of been arrested and jailed.
TEACHER WHOLLY TO BLAME!!
The amount of people defending what the bloke did shows that there are more complete and utter twats using the internet than ever before.  And all you fuckin' morons saying 'I'd have done the same if he sat on my car' are just spouting the usual kind of bollocks that your type always mouth off when your gob is bigger than your balls!
Nonsense the car gave the old man a ride to school totally innocent
The teacher didn’t sit on the car bonnet cos I saw as I was the kid on the bike (on the right)
Cheap car cheap driver
that's my teacher so fuck of m8s 
has to be a woman driving ...benefit mum had no dick last night ...Jeremy kyle fcking ppl
He didn't sit on the bonnet - he was forced on to the bonnet when the driver deliberately ran into him. The driver is a lunatic and should have his licence revoked.
iPhone moment at 4:07
Did anyone notice the zoella and pb top which zoe was wearing!!
Are you going Tullys farm this year?
Boyfriend goals right there
your such a sweet guy bought Zoe I phone 8 and I love the games you play looks like awesome birthday also, sorry about your acid reflects;(( hope you feel better peace and love
Was that a pb x zoella top I just saw
Love when you all get to hang out together! This is getting me excited about vlogging going to the pumpkin patch next month! 🙊🎃
anyone notice Alfie’s green top!?!?!!
Wait was Zoe wearing a PB + Zoella t-shirt at the start?
7:12 expect an epic vlog from Zoe soon 😂
I love the 8+. Such a big upgrade from the 6S I had.
Alcohol is really bad for acid reflux, so your 12 cocktails the night before may have been a contributing factor. I suffer with chronic acid reflux too. It's awful.
I suffer with really bad reflux also. Try not to eat carbonated drinks, chocolate, fruit juice, or tomatoes. They really flare acid.
Here's a tip, you should never kill a hornet because they let of a sent that attracts other hornets and there will be a massive swarm
I got the iphone 8+ yesterday for my birthday and I started crying because I thought I was just getting a 6+
Oh so want that phone!! #LBW where you at???
You always make your vlogs so interesting ❤️
did anyone else notice josh's face on joe's tshirt??? lolllll
I want a relationship like them 😫😞
Alfie just brightens up my day ☺️💗 can this be a shoutout or? 😙
Is that your new house😍
Omgggg on the boxes, there was written zizzi and in French, the word zizi means willy 😂
Be careful. If it's an Asian hornet ! They are dangerous
I looked through my subscription and I overlooked the title and I thought it said 18+ 😂
Did anyone catch the PB and Zoella merch at 5:28
WHEN R U GOING TO UPLOAD TO UR MAIN CHANNEL?! I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR LIKE A MILLENNIUM!
I love how you guys call each other 'gorgeous' 🤣💕💖
Tanya's figure is amazing. Love your vlogs Alfie xx
Such a lovely gang of friends! ☺️
#LBW sqaud🎉5pm is litrally the best part of my day👅
Alfie I suffer with the same thing u have got! It's not very nice though I hate it xx
Omg Alfie have his lock screen pictures of Zoe !!!!!
Surprise David Parker with a iPhone 8+
The pumpkins make me feel soo fall!!
Have not watched the vlogs in soooo long. Finally been able to catch up on all my subscriptions! When the heck did Zoe and Alfie move????
Next video surprising zoe with the iphone x
sounds harsh but should of killed the hornet, they kill honey bees.
What is that awesome balloon game!?
you need a electric bug zapper
Bruh I swear if my dad catched that bee he would've killed it lmao.
Tell me why he looks like Ryan from teen mom lol
That’s Japanese!! alfie!! (The first screen of your new phone )
I would have killed the shiz out of that bee
Great shots on the drone - they've got to be your best yet!
Drink the Aloe vera juice  (the INNER FILET ONLY) It will snuff acid reflux out! I use FRUIT OF THE EARTH brand.
Aw ): Alfie, I really hope you're feeling better :) xoxo!
That is a wasp!!
WHAT is this game called???
That is the biggest bee I have ever. Seen!!!
Please can you do a video on how you edit your photos for insta and some photography videos?
From eBay you can get a humane spider/insect catcher. It's like a sort of cup with a sliding base on the end of a stick and you can carry them away without hurting them. I think they're less than £5
can someone surprise me with an iphone too
My phone just broke, fancy buying me the new iPhone, Alfie :))))))
I'm in love with the shape of your balloon, push the pokie thing in more
Please bring out the tops u were wearing and do them as a pair so u can buy a pink and green one in a set or individualy
I used to have major reflux until I started taking digestive enzymes! Prescription strength acid blockers didn't work but these little capsules somehow do the trick. Their called Source Naturals Daily Digestive Enzymes (Bio Align) and they are meant to be taken with every meal/when you eat. Idk if you can get them in the UK but it's worth a try :-)
Switching to a Whole Food Plant Based Diet cured my cronic GERD. Took a few months but no more meds...worth a try.
Alfie - There is a surgical procedure that fixes reflux.  It's a Nissen Fundoplication.  The doc surgically tightens where the food goes in your stomach.  I had it.  Changed my life.  Can eat anything with no pain.  Good luck to you.
i also have really bad acid re-flux with painful flare ups.\nYour vlogs always help me to feel better though :D have a great day Alfie!! <3
Hey Alfie, I've got acid reflux in pretty much the SAME way as you! Teva-Pantoprazole Magnesium is a medication I take daily that has made my acid reflux completely go away as long as I take them every day. Just thought I'd suggest it to you in case you'd ever think to ask your doctor about it!
pleas follow me on DPOp  @kaddensecondhand

*uses same joke in this video and the pizza pot pie video*
If you ever did it again put the corn starch in a warm pan so the candy is always pliable and easy to work with.
Corinne! You should try making cotton candy flowers!!
I wanted to do this until I saw the corn starch...

This is soooo delicious. It disappeared from indonesian street food for almost 20 years. And now that it's in again, Imma FEAST!
Corinne, your hair looks beautiful, but for the love of God, please pull it back when you're working with food.
Rob reminds me of a 10-12 year old boy
In third grade I knew a kid that would eat his hair; he now works in government. Go figure!
You should of bit oil on the donut pan!!
I honestly expected rob to cut himself on the corn starch
I tried this the other day it took my five tries but it turned out like the one in you can do this
The first time Rob didn't fuck up.
If you turn on closed captions you can read her own lil twists to what she's saying and her jokes. It's HAIRlarious
You need to keep the corn starch tray under a warm area it would work faster.
She's already told that sauce joke.
3:12\nmy face when I find out that I had homework to do

You have to move your hand placement when you’re pulling. That’s why it’s breaking. Also you need a HUGE pile of cornstarch. Try watching HowToCookThat’s video.
Hey I also need subscribes so...
Do people really hate on Corinne's hair that much? Am I one of a small minority that thinks it looks really cool when it's growing out?\n\nAh, well. YOU DO YOU, CORINNE. You do you.
I think the corn starch is actually crack. Cristine gave them a contact of her dealer and now Rob and Corinne cant get enough of it.
Hey Corinne, this is a really random question but I was watching your old tattoo tag vid just now and I was wondering if you ended up finishing the mermaid tattoo on your back.
First time you did something I also suggested yay

I don't get all the negative comments about the contact lenses... they're no less fake than dying hair or applying eyelashes. It's fun to switch things up with your look. You look pretty as always Amelia!
Love you Amelia, but I think the reason people hate on the fake color lenses, it that they are incredibly distracting. Whether you think about it or not, people tend to look into the eyes of other people when they are talking, and when something as subtle as an eye color is different than what you are used to seeing it can become extremely distracting. I love all your videos, just wanted to share my opinion, plus your natural eye color is so beautiful!!
You look gorgeous in this video, as you do in all your videos. PLEASE do not listen to the negative comments about your eye contacts. They look great and so do you. It’s your life and YOU decide what to wear/do, not random internet trolls.
Love it! Old amelia style vid💗
Love your look with or without lenses. WHO CARES. Why would it bother someone else... its not hurting anyone? 😶
What a bunch of haters on here?! Ameila looks beautiful with or without her contacts. What her contacts do is only enhance her natural, already there beauty. I personally LOVE them on her. A few videos back some of you didn't like her winged eye makeup, which in my opinion looks also great on her. If a person don't support you Financially, Emotionally, and Mentally, then... (Fill in the blank)... them where they breathe.
Love the contacts for something fun and different! It might sound weird but you look more American with them lol
People need to lay off with the contact lense comments or at least be respectful. As someone that has dark coloured eyes, I love and wish I had light eyes. You always want what you don't have. That said, comments about how Amelia's contacts are distracting, fake, not your preference are unnecessary. If someone has naturally curly hair and straightens it, or likes to self tan if they're fair, or wants to wear contacts to change their eye colour and do something different it shouldn't be open for discussion. Live and let live.
What shade is the milani lipstick???
Are there any websites that sell Bourjois in the US?
Redken hair care is amazing! High rise shampoo and conditioner 😍
Omg I only just went to watch back the livestream you did with CT but I couldn't even finish watching because Charlotte actually annoyed the living *** out of me.. Sorry for my language here but omg.. You yourself were so lovely and pretty and knowledgeable as you always are and giving us really workable inforrmation and asking interesting questions to improve the flow and content of the livestream and to save C's ass a bit. \nCharlotte, on the other hand, is only yelling out DARLING, repeating herself, not finding her words, not saying anything sensible or substantiated about the product, is being VERY interruptive and rude as to not letting you speak, pulling & plucking & tucking at your face whilst constantly saying close your eyes & look at me while you were just told to look into the camera.. It was annoying me so much I didn't even finish watching. Was it just me? And is she always like this?
Yh do one high end one
Do you have snap chat??
Luxury version for sure!!!!!
love this! so helpful for back to school and work!
i love love your eye contact color ! looks so gorg on you 😍😍😍
People visit the support channel offline, happy everyone happy day
Yes to the high end one 🙌🏼 xxx
Did she say which shade she had of the NYX Vivid Brights Creme Color? I swear I've watched it back twice and I don't hear her mention the shade. Does anyone know which it is? I want to pick it up ASAP because it's gorgeous!
Fekkai brilliant gloss shampoo conditioner-best in the world!!
Mascara?
Good video! Luxury version ?? :)
i think you look amazing with this eye color!!
Which mascara would you recommend please????
What about mascara?
Loving the contacts xxx
What nail polish are you wearing?
Can't live without: AVON wash off water proof mascara, great for daily and comes off so easy! Not sure if you can get it in the UK; Also Almay non oil eye makeup remover pads, Costco brand make up remover wipes, and Sally Hanson Color Therapy or Complete Manicure nail polish, they also have the wide brush.
I actually love the colored lenses. You look so cute
Hi Amelia, long time follower here and I'm just glad to say that I loved today's video. However, I have to agree with some of the other commenters.  Those contacts are beautiful on you but I had to keep rewinding because they're distracting (and very beautiful)!  This might be a good thing for a date night... love you xxx
People that are hating on the contact lenses or claiming they are not 'hating' but still commenting negativly on the contact lenses need to learn that she feels great in the contact lenses and that should be the only thing that matters. You may not like them as it is different and something you would not usually wear but there is no point on commenting on it as it really doesn't effect her life at all and she will wear them regardless. \nPeople need to chill lol.
Try pureolgy hydrate! It has saved my color treated hair.
Great video Amelia!! What are you wearing on your lips in the video??
I love these contacts I don't know why anyone would not they're stunning
Love you Amelia, and I think you should wear whatever the heck color contact lenses you want. 👌🏼💋\nAnd YES! I have a holy grail shampoo and conditioner!! It has CHANGED. MY. HAIR GAME. ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨ it's the Bed Head Urban Antidotes level #3 (red bottle) for severely dry hair. OMG, I've tried other sets, even salon and prestige brands and nothing can touch the amount of life, body and softness this set gives me. I really hope you try it!! Good luck!🍀🍀🍀
Fantastic video Amelia, I have a lot of these products because of you (you're my number 1 enabler) my favourite though has to be the maybelline concealer it's soooooo good under my eyes!  Please please do an insta live soon.  💋 xx
it's so, so, so-so-so-so-so soooo gooood :D:D
Why so much negativity? Amelia you are beautiful, keep doing your thing x
Love you in those contacts 😍😍😍
I hope you don't take those negative comments to heart. I personally think these specific colored lenses you're wearing look more flattering on you ❤️ But I also do love your natural eye color as well ❤️ sending you and Duke much love ❤️
You should try the OGX Lemon Highlights Shampoo for your coloured hair. The whole range of OGX is amazing and I highly recommend you to try them 😊
You should try Aveda’s color treated shampoo & conditioner it works great!
You look soon pretty!! As usual. :)
Luxury version please!! :D
Im so jealous i wish there was a duke on my lap.
There aren't many drugstore eyeliners that can stand up to my oily eyelids, but the one from Revlon (the one that twists up) doesn't budge on me. I use the one with a purple cap, and the dark purple shade makes my brown eyes pop. 
Thanks for this video Amelia! Everyone on youtube seems to be so obsessed with luxury makeup lately
Why does almost all of the products look not used????
You need to try the maybelline eye shadow pallet
For your suggestion I really wanted to know about the N7 line I really want to know if is good, please let us know if you try some products and what you think about it . Love your videos. For the contacts is a little different but it doesn't bother me at all.
I really like it, I think she looks so beautiful!  Keep wearing them. It softens her look, and she looks more feminine and she is just having fun. Its fine!
In my opinion, whtever she wears on her eyes, that's her choice and that's a kind of fashion. I really don't mind and she looks amazing.
I think your lenses make your eyes look very pretty
Amelia, you are so lovely! I am so in love with British culture. Women seem to have a femininity that American women kinda lack ( me )! I started watching your vids just because we share a name :) but I think you are sweet and funny and produce really great videos! I love Duke too! xo
Amelia you look really good with those lenses. it suits you
The lenses make you look blind.
that eye colour looks lovely  on you but i want to  scratch my eyes while watching this aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
Green eyes are awesome on you!!!
You look a bit like Miranda Kerr in the thumbnail!
need that shimmery l'oreal shadow in my life ASAP
I wish I could send you the drugstore shampoo I use bc since its from a Brazilian brand you won’t find anywhere but in Brazil, but its soooooo good, it leaves my hair so smooth and shiny and it really helps my hair growth
Try Sally Hansen Colour Therapy in blushed petal! It's my #1 favourite nail polish... I'm on my 4th bottle, it's always on my nails! It lasts forever and leaves my nails so nourished and strong!
Let her live geez contacts are fun to play with haha the milani baked bronzes are good they're so glowy
Giiiirl, what is on your nails right now, in this video?! That color is giving me LIFE, I need it....!
Love your makeup in this video, will you do a tutorial on this look? You look so amazing!! I am going to have to buy most of these products now, love this video!!! So cute!! ❤😙
I loooove that you included cut aways of your old videos. Soo nostalgic and beautiful!
You look like a completely different person with your contacts!!! That must be fun to change up!
OMG you look so different with colour lens :O Almost didn't recognized you ;-) You look amazing :-) Which ones are, please? xx
Some amazing things here. The pallete is definitely one of my personal holy grail. I would love if you could check out my Disney world vlog channel !
essence satin lipsticks and what lipstick combo are you wearing
Big fan of the contact lenses! I can't believe how much of an impact it has, I noticed on the thumbnail you looked different! I have blue eyes but would love to try brown!
Ignore the hysteria about the lenses. They're fun aren't they? I use them & it's great to change up your look x
Great info and loved that you have made everything easy and affordable for everyone. Sometimes the more luxury products are out of reach
loved it! and yes please a luxury version!
Great info! Love the video, thank you for all the ideas Amelia! 😍☀️
❤ Amelia!!!  I think you would really like the L'Oreal True Match blush in Subtle Sable!  It's very natural,  with a satin finish.  I was introduced to this blush by someone who primarily uses high end blushes, and fell in love with it.  Just thought I'd mention it to you as well, since you featured a few L'Oreal products and you seem to tlike them too... :)))\nI wish so much they sold that Garnier Rose Water Balm in Canada...  Went to look for it online and it looks like it's only available in th UK... :(  You are so lucky!!!\nP.S.  Those lenses are beautiful but I still think you are stunning with your natural eye color...  Although it could also be because it makes you look like a different person and I'm so used to the real you... :))  Hard to tell...
Omg I just used that Garnier sheet mask last night for the first time. I loved it! I used it a couple hours before bed and my skin woke up so hydrated.
I really love your videos, they're really pleasant to watch. By the way, regardless all the negative comments, I really like your contact lenses!! Lots of love from Spain :)
The contacts look so good!
Love this videos and went through and liked a couple comments that focused on the content rather then focusing on changes. You're always the best
Yes the luxury...... 😁😁😁 please
Yes, to the luxury version!
Ameliaaaaa I would love to see the luxury version ones! Please do them soon :D
I’m would love to see more videos on your lipstick collection maybe like best of drugstore as well as high ends for fall or something like that!! And Yes for the luxury brand version of this video. ❤️😘
What about mascara?? I know it's hyped but I do love the new loreal paradise one. It's so good! I also use the simple cleansing oil love it to take off my makeup xxx
what bedding do you have?
so weird to see you with this eye color, I actually prefer your natural color 😊
Shampoo and conditioner!! Try Living Proof. The restore line in the purple bottle. It makes your hair super soft and smells so good. (:
I'm sorry but I think that you're natural eyes look so much nicer than these contact lenses! :(
I swear those lenses are so distracting Amelia! 😭😭
Why why youtubers are talking about beauty and often have chipped nails? I don't understand...I love this video but those chipped nail close ups make me cringe..
Love the green lenses on you Amelia!
My problem with the foundations is the fact that I have oily skin and foundations tend to oxidise on my face and get darker what do you recommend me to use ,what type of foundation should I buy
Need to try this garnier 3in1 mask, your skincare recommendations always work for me so I already know I'm going to love it 😍
hi amelia ! love your nail color. what brand is it ??? I need to purchase this hahah
No mascara??????? Or eyebrow products?????? Whooaaaa
I would love to know what is on your nails! Beautiful colour <3
Where are your contacts from?
Whats your eye shadow today?! So pretty!! Sorry if I missed you say it x
What's done is done💔\n\nGonna miss you guys so much!
Love how limbo panto-esque the name is as well, harkening back to the eras of she purred while I grrrd and Brave Bulging Buoyant Clairvoyants
Your split has broken my heart. However this is a great track to drop before the end.
Seeing this pop in my notifications feels like salt in the wound! Still hard to believe they broke up. The crying Boy King illustration is only fitting! :^(\n\nRegardless of it all, I will always love you guys!!!
It sad that we had to wait until you broke up just to listen to another master piece like this one. I'll miss you guys :'(
Today I leasing radio and who's say - it's end of wild bests, this is true?
Glad I was able to see you guys in Baltimore all those years ago! Videos are still on my page. Always remember! Thank you guys for the many great years of music. You were a big part of a good chunk of my life. My 3 year old daughter even knows your music :) best of luck!
Still can’t believe you guys are splitting up, you’re the best band in the UK. I can’t believe you’d end as you guys definitely had so much more to give. Thanks for all your music. X
I'M SO SAD AND YET SO HAPPY OH GOD WHY DID YOU HAVE TO SPLIT
No, Did they split up? But they have to be in my movie, they just don't know it yet...
I still can't get over knowing the next time I see you boys perform will be the last. Thank you for every song you shared with us.
The many songs wildbeasts have made I will always cherish and remember, good luck with your journeys, just wanted to say thank you for your music moving me out of mental health problems when I listened to wanderlust it made me think about my life and it gave me strength, thank you
that voice
Nice!
<3 :'(
So Good
It sounds greaaat!
Amazin'
Incredible song as always 😍❤
Farewell guys, gonna miss you
Brilliant song :(
We couldn't go with them, dreamliner
They broke up that's fd up
Lit Boizzz.
Since I've read that they won't be playing together anymore I've been coming to term with the fact that I'll never listen to them live. And seeing this in my subscription box is like a last goodbye. Thank you for being my favorite band since Limbo Panto came out. Enjoined following you on you musical journey. Such an innovative and mature band. It's been a wild ride.
At least bring The Farewell Tour to Mexico, let us enjoy your live music one last time.
They're back!!!!!
You guys are so great! I've been following you all for 3 years and I love watching your food adventures. Recently I found out I have adult food allergies, like last week, and all the food I love is no longer allowed (like soy, corn, rice, oats, chicken, and wheat as well as anything derived from these products). It's a dream of mine to travel abroad but I'm scared I won't be able to get around with all my allergies. Would you ever consider going to an allergies free place, if it exists? you guys rock my socks thanks!
Yummm! I've been waiting for the vegan Ramen video! So glad you finally found one that made the cut. My favorite vegan restaurant is in Winter Park, Florida and it's called Vegan Café. They have the BEST menu filled with yumminess from Summer special Bean Burritos to Hawaiian Pizza. Sooo good!!
As someone who's Fodmap AND doesn't eat pork I teared up when I saw they had OV. I never knew it was a thing over there :O Time to go back to Japan for a third time! :D
TAKE BACK THE NIGHT!!!
Liking this video just for the 'Simon is too big...Simon is too hot...Simon is too whiny segment 😂😂😂
why do you guys delete videos of places you don't like?? shouldn't you show the good and the bad?
Please do more vegan/ vegetarian food vids in Japan!!!
Vegan is definitely not blan or boring that was totally a misconception I had 😉 Thanks for giving vegan food a try!
@sharmander @taylorr you should visit this place :)
I absolutely adore your videos! I'm glad you guys came back to make videos!!
if they dont like eggs then they should try fake eggs from china
Can you guys do an updated how to eat ramen like a pro ???
Still waiting for the peach video... so I watched the ad before the video.
im suddenly reminded of that time when martina lost a game and threw simon's cupcake on the wall lol
Awesome that you don't promote places that you dont like. I think oriental vegetarian is the same as Jain vegetarian (milk is allowed strange, but no potatoes) im also pretty sure soy meat (daizuniku) is the same as TVP (textured vegetable protein)
well I still love you no matter what you eat  I personally am against Veganism for the sake of it if it for religious reasons I can get behind it  but my point is we all eat we all consume  we are on the top of the food-chain  .. I have met some really laid back chill Vegan, and Vegetarians that are really cool people  who do  not judge me for my food choices and I have nothing but warm fuzzies for them   I just wish everybody would do that when it comes to it because food is about  community and cherishing your neighbor ... I love you guys and your message so please keep doing what you are doing
Simon is getting better at pinching food with Japanese chop-sticks and used to Japanese life style such as towel handkerchief. Also eating noodles with putting them on spoon is good manner for those who feel hesitation to slurp.
yes! Please more videos like this :D love more FapFap style  videos. Gah I miss FapFaps, eat your sushi segments, WTFs and TLDRs :(
Wow the place has halal ramen too? Amaziingg
They also have vegan ramen at t's tin tin in tokyo station!
Post some of the footage from places you guys hated! I think that would be hilarious to see what foods you didn’t like. Throw back to old school Korean toast video XD
Vegans aren't making a difference in the world
God I want some good vegan ramen. I settle for pho, because we have a lot of Vietnamese restaurants around here. A significant lack of ramen places, though. :(
May I know what kind of phone casing is Martina using, 1:07? Is it available on Amazon?
Simon an Martinez really you guess remind me and my boyfriend of us. We also giggles in happienss when you post sweats and pastries! So those are our favorites 😊😊😊😇😇😘😍😚 I also share pain maybe not as much as you but I share that feeling of depression and other pain. I understand you don't like pitty party's I do not either they make it hard to get out of the black hole of sadness that is every day. .. So seriously you can't die not yet not by your own cute adorable hands because everyone like us who has pain. We were born for a reason that reason is to feel all life has to give us in return for the suffering.  Even if it's not a good day there will be one and seeing you strive on inspires me not to hit the K.O button on this game of life... So please push on and hope to meet you one day.  Even if I have to fly all the way to Japan to just get to meet you I will. :') I love you Mar-Mar please don't stop being Kawaii and living. And *hugs and baths* for all the bad days!.....(seriously I mean it... You inspire me)... Ugh I am a dork and this was maybe the wrong way to get in touch but I watch every upload even if it takes weeks I do.... Cause I am stuck inside most days... So yeah lol love you lots 😍
Thank you for making a video for vegans!!!! Much appreciated
Please try the limited edition Halloween cola secret flavor in Japan 😭😭😭😭😭😭
It.Looks.Amazing! I miss ramen so much, I just moved to Miami FL from Vancouver BC and the thing I miss the most is ramen!! I have not found any ramen restaurants yet ;___:
YAY FOR BEING VEGAN and actually caring about the world😂😂
I’m so happy you did a vegan video! I have not been able to get into your videos sense going vegan!
Not on my Christian app
Vegan food is soooo good!  Glad you know it now. lol
Can you guises do more videos about OV food? Or midnight cooking the divine pickles you two love? 💜
While I'm sure it's delicious, my favorite part of ramen is the eggs, so I'll probably just stick to the non vegan version, lol but i definitely have friends i might have to recommend this to!
I'm hungry now
I hope the chef is going to move to London.
It was meant to be - I'm heading to Japan in little over 2 weeks and I've been thinking abt searching around for some ramen I could eat as I'm vegetarian - and guess what - we are freaking staying 1km away from that restuarant! ahahahahaha thank you for showing this, I will go there for sure.
who can Roman be vegan Roman it's  almost rice as it ia
Oh god this was such a great video. The sweat rag was hilarious
NO!!!! STOP RUINING FOOD VEGANS!!!!!! GO BACK AND EAT YOUR TREES!
I am horrible, I got here a bit late.
I don't eat vegan, I just healthy.
You can tell how healthy the oil is by the colour of it.\n\nWoah.
You delete the videos of restaurants you didn't like? That used to be one of the great aspects of FAPFAP, the Korean cheese toast place was an awesome episode.
Thank you so much for uploading a video like this, now i feel hopeful to find a vegan/vegetarian place in Japan.
You guys help me to imagine the good taste of the ramen. The cold is killing my sense of taste. xD
I eat meat, yet I want to eat vegan ramen now.\n\nI'm wondering though, is it possible to make vegan ramen wrong?
Nothing vegan is good except for straight fruits and vegetables. Fuck vegans.
Such a great chef. The food looks delicious and I am on a fast :)
Simon has to get used to using the folding fan. In Japan it is normal.
Thank you so much! I love it!
Hey Martina :) is there any possibility to get some pictures of your feet? I would pay for them!
If its halal ramen places, I can name a few good ones:\nShinjuku Gyoen Ramen Ouka\nHalal Ramen and Dining Honolu (their Ebisu shop)\n\nT's tantan is also good! And also the vegan curry at Coco Ichiban's. I've also heard Coco Ichiban recently serves halal curry at their Akihabara location, but I haven't been there yet.\nsince I'm a Muslim student living in Tokyo, finding eat outs that I can go guilt-free has become a (slightly expensive) pastime.
I'm glad to see you guys covering for vegan!\nGotta vouch for one of my fave ramen shop in Japan - Mamazen in Kyoto..\nI'm not vegan but their ramen is one of the best i tried.. SOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD. \nDo check it out if you're around kyoto!
I loved this cause I used to love watching your food videos but haven't really since going vegan
Vengeance Martina, vveeeengeance! \nHaha but that looks seriously deeeelicious! As a vegan food lover I would so go there!
Thank you for making a video highlighting vegan food! I just went vegan this past May. I am hoping to improve my over all health with a whole food vegan diet. So far my health isn't any worse! Yay! My dysmenorrhea seems to be gone, but I don't want to say for sure until a full year of it being gone. I'm looking forward to seeing what this diet does to my blood panels. I haven't noticed a change for my HEDS nor my Dysautonomia, but I'll take what I can get. XD I know the people of Okinawa ate a nearly vegan diet long long ago. They used to eat many starches. They used to have some of the greatest number of centurions on the planet. I'd love to see a video learning more about the older traditional Okinawan lifestyle. They have lots to offer besides a high starch diet. Plus I hear it's absolutely beautiful there. Maybe you've already filmed there, but maybe this is a new excuse to visit. ;) I'd be really interested to learn about more traditionally vegan dishes of Japan. (Like the stuff that people don't think of as vegan.) A guide to what widely available Vegan dishes might be safe to eat in Japan would be pretty neat too! Okay, enough rambling from me. Have a wonderful day and best wishes! 🌟⭐🌟
Isn't Martina going to the new Sailor Moon Cafe??? I really wanna see her there :/
I am super excited that I'm going to visit Japan next year in April, with my class! This is super fun to watch :D #buildaladder
You can tell something is good if Simon and Martina fight over who will eat it.
Vegan Ramen is AMAZING. It's my new favorite.  Try it. ;)
u\ng\nl\n*
Burn it
Nope.
Isn't Coco curry always applicable XD
Awesome!  Do more vegan/veggy places 😄
Answer: Fuck no
Vegan Ramen 😤😐 boi just eat the fucking meat
You mean Raman noodles
your earrings are so cute martina! ✨
SO PUMPED
I love some Pye Ying!
Soy meat is delicious!!
Simonnnm, are u bald? SQUIDWAARRRRRD
Dump the ramen crap, whole grains please
Thanks for sharing!
Boi dis shit looks like normal noodles
Vegan and ramen don't match .
Yay halal vegan food
Waaaait??! Ramen isn't vegaaaan?????!!!!!
Actual question. Is vegan anything really good? Answer- no.
CAN WE JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO NOTICE HOW BEAUTIFUL JAPAN IS?? AND THE GORGEOUS PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN IT? 💕💕
Trending on YouTube in UK 47ahhhhh😁😁👏👏👏👏well done guys😁
As a vegan this really raises my hopes for travels to Japan! And also I'm thrilled that Simon eats ramen the same way I do - noodles onto spoon
Also silly silly. Going in with expectations of it being weird. Vegan anything is delicious. Just about who's putting the effort into making it! Many vegan burgers I've had at unique restaurants are better than cheapy meat burgers. Im an omnivore but vegan fine dining is sublime!
holy shit this looks freakin perfect! im saving the info,thank you for the review 😚
Short answer no. Anything vegan SUCKS
How tall is Simon?
#40 on trending?! Whaaaat
wait, you dont upload things you dont like?
i feel like I've seen this video before... have you done a sneak peek of it?
I've been suscribed for some years now it makes me really, REALLY happy when I see you guys go to vegetarian/vegan places and enjoy the food :) as I am a longtime vegetarian/recent vegan. Keep it up guys and lots of love from Mexico!
You guys make videos you don't publish? How often does it happen that you don't enjoy a restaurant that you review?
Fuck, I have to go to Japan!!!!!!! I envy my cousin since she works for a Japanese Airline 😢 but I hate airplanes 😪
Not all Vegan Ramen are good 💁 i have a Ramen store around the corner , it belongs to a Russian guy that lived 30 years in Japan and he knows how to make really good japanese food. He also has Vegan Noodles but they are very stiff. Also his Vegan broth is tastes like Miso soup and is very boring. The normal beef/pork soup is very good even without chunks of meat so it is ~kinda vegetarian for those who dont like meat textures. However vegans will always say sth is delicious even if its hidious 😂
Running out of topics? Ramen review....again! How come no episodes with Japanese people about differences/similarities, pop culture subjects (manga, fashion, anime, movies), onsens, talks with other expats, etc....
Yay! Vegan things on trending videos 🌱💚
VEGAN FOOD IS TERRIBLE!\nVirtue signaling liars.
is there a food you dont like ??
yay you guys are on trending! :)
I love her so much omg 😂💕
When she put that skirt on I was DAMN XD
find out about the effects of fast fashion on the enviroment
aliexpress next, its pretty similar to wish
Awe!! I love your hair that way!! It looks so cute wet and wavy like that! 💘
How did you get your hair like this??
can you review beautiful halo? they always have cute stuff and great sales but every time i've ordered the product has been a miss and customer service is extremely rude. like theres the yeah they were rude  but no they were actually rude when my product had gone missing. Anyway I still want to see if that site is worth it. BeautifulHalo.com
ahhh i love your videos so much!!! <3 also i have a request, could you do a haul on 66GIRLS , its a korea based clothing shop and i think you'll like the clothes ^^
I really like the Jackets, the black dress and the blk & white dress.
Please take pictures once you wear that black dress!
I bought that striped maxi dress on shein lol conspiracy confirmed
Her reactions are hilarious 😂😂😂  .. Dying laughing right now
You should do Shecup and Pretty little things.
Shein is too expensive 4me.  I love your hair.  Plz keep wearing it.   Take care, n ‘KEEP IT FLYIN.’\nVelinaTheFlutterby@gmail.com\nWhere simple explanations are your keys to beauty 🦋
Please tell me where u got ur top? 👌😍
Do swap.com \nIts an online thrift store and ive been wanting to try it but idk how it is lmao
How can you be so rude and you’re only 13 dollars. 😂😂😂😂 I cannot with you Patricia
They are not the same site. They are both Asian sites that use the same manufacturers/warehouses. You'll find a lot of similar/the same items on Aliexpress, Alibaba and Wish.
Her hello , goodbye with the glasses made me laugh so hard
How does she manage to make everything look good?
i think it'd be interesting to see hauls from the subscription style websites i.e. fabletics, justfab, etc.\nlove these videos!
you INSTANTLY looked like the little girl from Matilda with those glasses on!
With the red velvet dress you could just just cut off some extra fabric 🤷‍♀️
Where is your necklace from please !!!!
Can you haul shoes next instead of clothes? Assessing quality, style, cost etc
can you do a video on clothes from amazon! love your videos!
Omfg woc look so good in white I look like a garbage bag in white wtfff
@patricia is that one of your wigs? If so which one?
Romwe and SheIn are the same websites but Romwe is cheaper
that leather skirt was BOMB on you you crazy
I knew that! I always thought that Romwe and SheIn are like same company or have the same owner. And I think there is a third site but I don't remember the name
Did anyone find the link for the criss cross beige jumper? The one with the white strings
I GOT A SHEIN AD ON THE VID!
I like that symmetrical top and skirt that outfit was really cute
Patrisha what dose your real hair look like I would like to see
You're so cute with the glasses on ❤️
I saw that same white and black maxi dress on SheIn lol
shein, romwe and zaful are all from the same company
shes so pretty but her voice is so fucking annoying like can you please make an entire video where you keep your fucking mouth shut
The phrase flying to the wind made me laugh 😂😂😂

I thought she said really really cheap 😭
The red jacket reminded me if Emma from once upon a time
can you please do bikinis from Zaful your literally the only honest person i trust hahaha and i want to shop there but dont want to waste my money
Bitch you talk too much
All the dresses are soooo nice on you !!
😹😹😹 I looked like I made a mistake in life. 😹😹😹
Can anyone imagine how big her closet must be❤️💜
Your hauls are so fun to watch.
Between her voice and personality, it's clear that she was *made* for TV!!! Come on PTB!
Pls make a video of how you keep your frontal looking like that. So neat
Could we please get an updated BOOBS BUMS, and BODYCON video!! I think it would be puuurfect for Halloween time to make costumes parties extra sexy!! OXOXO from California!! 💁🏼💕
I bloody love these videos. You make me howl
I LOVE LOVE LOVE that multiple way red velvet dress! literally just bought it!! i've been looking for a red dress and a velvet dress and a multiple way dress so this is all three in one! I've just bought a navy silk maxi multiple way for a formal i'm going to, I wish i saw this sooner because the dress I bought was AUS$110 compared to this one which was AUS$25. (I totally feel cheated)
On me it looks like I mad a mistake in life dead 😂😂😂😂😂
Shein and Romwe are the same, no conspiracy.
love these videos, you’re  always making me laugh
this is my first video of yours ive ever watched and youre already my fav youtuber lol
“With my nipple to the wind” LMAO
She's always spending over 100 dollars on websites
I frickin' love you!!! I am sooooooo happy that I found your channel a while ago. I just wanted to thank you for being honest in your videos and making me laugh when I'm feeling down. Wish that we could just hang out and go shopping and grab coffee!!!! LOVE you! Keep being you!
Those glasses remind me of Miss Honey from Matilda 😂
She needs a slap in the face to shut her up
The black dress \n\nHello from the     oooooooooooooooooooooooooohhhhh!\n🦄
I love you Patricia! You're hilarious!
If it dose not have a label on the back there should be a label on the side witch should always be on the left

ORDER TOTE BAGS FROM EBAY
Hahaha this has to be one of my new favorites. Jeremy's acting is on-point.
I love how he says 'just keep swimming' when a Dory type of fish swims on camera
I like the framed picture on the wall in the background.
When I got my wisdom teeth out, I though I was a robot.
Oh my gosh, I absolutely adore this sketch! I've been having a really stressful day, and this video was the perfect study break. Studio C, thank you for gracing the world with your art. You never fail to put a smile on my face. ❤
Worst Studio C sketch ever. Thought if I stayed to the end it might redeem itself. But nope. Not that the acting was bad. It was the concept that fell flat for me.
Am I a notification viewer?
How can he be a beta fish if its a salt water tank?
Let me guess. The kyle fish is coming
omg good job +Jeremy Warner! this was literally so funny!!!!! i love the background music in the beginning! congrats you guys this was so hysterical
How do you do all these props? 😂😂😂you guys are amazing😂😂😂
Worst most boring Studio C video ever.
Who actually thought Cc Was close captions?
Why did he get so eloquent half way through XD
Jeremy did such a good job in this sketch though
This is really silly. 'Not well done.
NEED TO CATCH THE POKEMONS!!
This is one of Jeremy's best sketches.
I love how when he says I guess, just keep swimming? a dory swims into the frame
Every fin shall bow! :-D\n\n\n\n\nAnd every gill confess?
wut
just keep swimmin, just keep swimmin, just keep swimmin, swimmin, swimmin!
ZALMURON THE REINCARNATED
Is Whitney pregnant?
Nice
Hey , its Nemo and Dory
Rip headphone users
Donner, party of one XD Please tell me other teens get this.
This is trending?!\n\nWay to go!
Maybe I should cancel my wisdom teeth removal...
Still enjoy new sketches, but a little too much yelling in this one. :-)
The best of Jeremy! Thanks for the laughs!
Can I get a Happy Birthday since it's my b-day
Dude I think I'm a fish without drugs man...🐟🐡🐠
Something seems kind of fishy about this video....
It's about time Studio C was trending!!! Good for you guys!
When you try something new lol😂😂😂😂 2:00
Haha! I just started playing this video and my brother walked in on the opening tune. It's such a familiar sound that he thought it was his ringtone! XD
Did Whitney get a haircut!! Loving it!!!
I would have died if he said Im Nemo!!!
I haven't even catch all the Pokémon lmao that got me there and also Betta fish aren't even scary lel except for the males just from the colours
It'd been a while since I've seen studio c
This is how stupid all white people are know wonder there all racist
PLOT TWIST: He is Zalmuron the Reincarnated and he finally reincarnated as a human and is so paranoid that he will die and reincarnate he thinks he has died and reincarnated as a fish. 0:42
I KNOW THAT EXACT OFFICE I USED TO GO THERE ALL THE TIME
Please make another parody version of a band (like Led Zepplin, Queen, Eagles, or the Animals, any one of their songs, please make a funny version of it.
The new episode didn't go to season 7
Dang I knew that stuff did things to people’s heads but this is redundant. XD
I could make a better video with 3 minutes prep time.
It's always so easy to identify a Jeremy written sketch.
This reminded me of my sister when she got her wisdom teeth removed.😂
who else got really concerned for Jeremy XD
I love this sketch, but it was dragging just a little in a couple places.
#32 on trending!!! YES! Now more people can watch studio c!!
You guys should make a worst car dealer skit.
Can you make Ninjago video like you pretend you are ninjas and that's the team of ninjas just like Lloyd Kai Zane Jay Cole and nya
jeremy, was this embarressing?

TRENDING YES WE DID IT REDDIT!!!\n\n\n\n\nNo one? ... ok I will show myself out
Don't do drugs kids
I definitely couldn't open my mouth like that after my oral surgery. Nor could I talk like that. Or move like that. But I was groggy enough to see exactly where the hands of the clock pointed but not figure out the time till ten minutes later.
Whitneys haircut is awful
Lolz
Lol and here I thought Jeremy was a bad actor xD great Job dude
Going downhill i see
2:12 tho 😂
Another trending studio C? Weird!!
OMG. THIS VIDEO IS ON TRENDING ON YOUTUBE!!!!!!!!
Jeremy.
That was awesome 👏👏👏👏👏

He sounds like a retard XD
This was hilarious! 😂😂😂😂\nI want to know who the 561 who didn't like this were.
LOL
Ooooo my gosh I love studio c sooo much! 😂😂😂😂👌👌👌👌
Good Job on Trending!

Is this the forgotten sequel to that Kevin Smith movie with the I'm a Mac guy?
Lovely requiem at the beginning
They missed one of mine. Came in and screwed up a molar. Assholes.
Studio C has jumped the SHARK...\nI'm sorry, I just had to. But in all honesty, this isn't creative humor, just the dumb kind.
You can see Jeremy's reflection in the glass.
WHOOOOO STUDIO C OM TRENDING
This should also be done with squirrels.
Why didn't he just look around and realised he was making things up?
*Public Service Announcement*\n1. Search - ROFL with Ray\n2. Prepare to Laugh\n3. Laugh\nWhy? Because a day without laughter is a day wasted...\nThat is all.
Thanks for the closed captions Studio C!
He is Zalmuron, the REINCARNATED!!
JEREMY NEEDS TO BE THE STAR OF MORE SKETCHES
12,000th LIKE!!!!!!!!! OMG!!!
Donner Party of one. Hahaha
YES TRENDING! *overjoyed*
yeah boi its trending
Olans back! Yeehaa!🤣 you should tell your storys on stage as standup😋
This was AMAZING You're going to be the best Dad and Grandad EVER! I always loved to hear my grandad's story's and you remind me of (a much younger version of) him :D Good luck on Final Space sir!
I started silent laughing as soon as he unmute the TV. Couldn’t breathe for a second. I’m okay now...Incase anyone was wondering 😂😭
Promise me one thing hit the text books. Haha.
I'm so happy your back
It's been so long since we've seen you! This was the first time I've laughed in over four months.
holy mother of a boiling spoonful of salt these stories are the epitome of hilarity.

Ahhh, missed yo face O! The story was a bit of a stretch for me :/...just wasn't feeling it personally, but it's good to see/hear from you...It's been a while, yeah...it's a been while. #GITS
Oh my god this is brilliant!!!! XD XD XD XD XD XD XD XD XD
Some random person in jail called my cell phone TWICE! Thank god I was busy and didn't answer, the automated system left me voice mails. 😲
You never cease to me make me laugh til my tummy hurts. You truly crack me up! Thank you, Olan, for sharing  your crazy life experiences with us. :)
I just want you to know... you're my hero. My girlfriend very strongly believes that you are my spirit animal. Just thought you should know.
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST BLOCK HIM!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!
Jack Black? You look so young!
It’s about time you came out with a new story Bro!!!
I NEEDED A STORY SO BADLY TODAY. I've got an awful cold and an exam next week and crap tons of homework and I just really needed something to take my mind off it all and smile about. Thanks so much Olan!!
Straight up, my name is Donovan and I kept hearing you say my name and I sorta got super stoked. He knows me omg how do I social
did you purposely match your shirt to your bed?
How is it that despite going months between telling stories, it doesn't feel like it's been that long? There must be some sort of strange temporal distortion going on here. Are Starscream and TARDIS messing with the timeline?
You don't mess with the Tennessee Wonder Child and if you do, your name is probably Marcus
OlanRogers you are the funniest person I have ever heard. Hey and good job with the songs
Did not see that ending coming!!!!!!!
DED
6:05 why tho? IM CRYING
that was BEAUTIFUL
haha
IS THIS TRUE?!? 😂😂😂😂😂
KING OF STORIES
V clutch with the matching shirt and bedding.
HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH
MARCUS!!!!!!!
I love your story telling, you are God, been following a while so glad you're back..so close to 1M subs now.
I'm taking my son to LUNCH!
OH MY GLOB YES A STORY THANK YOU I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT
And they never called back. I don't know why I was so friendly
UR STORIES MAKE MY DAYS SO MUCH HAPPIER THANK U
I love how it feels like watching a movie when I listen to his stories, he paints such a perfect picture of what's going (>^_^<)
Hey Olan did you ever get your debit card back from Gizmo? I need that $20 for some crazy bread:)
I literally can't even breathe! I LOVE your crazy stories!
I'm more glad that this man was born
I'm so glad your back! I've missed story time!!!!
It's been too dang long
I have wanted someone to call me over and over again for this very reason.
Incredible story, once again, Olan.  Thanks for the laughs
This was fantastic! It might surpass Ghost in the Stalls in my opinion but they're both so hilarious it's hard to say!
For someone's name who is Donevin myself, its very rare to hear my name anywhere. Also I had a similar experience, some guy maybe around his 50's called me on my cellular device, and told me Now litsen here mother f****, you better be ready because we're about to roll up on your block. I was just appalled because someone was being threatened that wasnt me. The only response that came out in my confusion was ok. Then he proceeds to say Do you know who this is!!! Im over here just thinking I sure hope not. So I decide to yell back at him  Do you know who this is!! And he says no, who is this? Then I respond in a very calm like matter, Not who you think this is. The only thing that comes out of his mouth is .....oh. Then I tell him yeah wrong number man and he hung up. Im not sure who this man was or whose street he was going to roll down but I sure hope its on a decline hill so he may roll into the sunset forever embarrassed by his wrong number phone call.
I. Have. Been. Waiting. So. Long. For. This. YES
When Olan starts laughing so hard that he starts choking... that gets me more than the story does every time 😂😂😂
W E R E B E A R S
When you live in Tennessee :') I'm shOOk
*and I hung up* motion 😂
God that was soooo Memphis I’m dead
MORNING MADE!!! \nI LOVE YOUR STORIES!!! YOU ARE THE MASTER COMMANDER! \nMARCUS, I MEAN TRAY I MEAN OLAAAAAAAN 😂😂😂
I LOVE YOUR STORIES SO MUCH!!!! Nothing makes me smile more!
It was a mistake watching it the first time at a library, my face was turning red, veins were clearly visible, and I was tearing up because I was trying so hard to contain myself. I had to watch it a few more times after that in order to catch up with my laughter.
Your stories are the best stories
S T O R Y  T I M E

The ending was great 👌🏾👌🏾. I’m so glad he’s back 😁

Why did Trey have the lunchbox, when it was Donovan who owed the money?
I was so friendly
i showed my mom this video and she called you a boy child man
OUR SAVIOR (also I thought that I would point out the fact you sound a little like Chris Pratt)
Olan! Funny and amazing content as always! Glad to have you back, but you gotta lay off the carbs dude.
I love how you mess with people! You are my hero! Also my best friend is named Trey.

I live for the bloopers lol
No fuego?! 🤔 no over the top?! 😭 lol 😂 \nLoved the look, I've seen plenty of looks and I def need this palette in my life 😍 you're just so pretty!!
That background is so cute 🍆💜🦑🍇🛰🎵🎶🔮🔯♈♉♊♋♌♍♎♏♐♑♒♓⛎⚜⚕✳⚅🌌
You literally look like this emoji 🤔 when contemplating the concealer stick 😂😂😂😂like your facial expression is that exact emoji and you should talk to Kim about your face being the contemplating face for KIMOJIs
Jonye's commentary gives me life 😂😂😂
You never do basic looks, their always so different, artsy, and editorial😻🔥
You should try the First Aid beauty skin tint for the no makeup makeup!
what was the concealer brush she used when she was buffing her shape tape concealer?
THE BEST FOUNDATION FOR oily skin hands down ♡♡♡
Love the background!! i have just tested these products too and mostly loved them all! :D
giiiirl that set up in the back got me feelin some type of way i love it
What do you use on your hair? Where are all your baby hairs? Please share your tricks......😊
I remember back in the day u ALWAYS did a nose contour...why don't u do it any more?
👍👀✌
Blinking Beaute is based out of the Bay Area!
What is with all of these cancerous make up videos on trending? These bitches shouldn't be allowed on YouTube.
Love love love this! Thank you for not using trophy wife!
You and desi need to do another get ready with us!!!!!
Going through the same with my hair 😂 I’m so done with highlights I have like 4 different layers from 3 different people soooo... I’m just growing it out 😂
Psh I'm too pretty for makeup.
i just wish the audio was a little louder bcs there are moments where your voice is really low and I cant kinda hear it. no hate just suggesting
this background is bomb🔥👀
ONCE I GOT IT WET IT GOT SO BIG LMAAOOO LOVE IT
I think the Foundation looks very very nice on you..😍😍😍😎😎😎😎
Her frustration when the lash box didn't focus... I feel you Katy !!! \nhaha \nLove this look!!!!
I love the moment when you are trying to decide whether you like the matte highlight stick! Hmmm hmmmm hmmmm lol
Your background gives me Bangerz vibes, I love it!
I wish you would start video bare faced , I like to be surprised with the look 😂😘 .. loving the Katy neon light 😊
I grabbed a sample of it because I'm not really huge on matte foundations and it looked really nice on the skin but after wearing it a week straight it was just ehhh for me. I feel the same way about my Dior forever foundation. If it ain't dewy I don't want it 🙅🏽 it's not bad, but it's not my fav. 🤷🏽‍♀️
THAT NAME IN THE BACK THO IM DYING
No Makeup Makeup: Extended Cut\n\nMaybe the it Cosmetics cc cream? I use that a lot. Nice for no makeup days.
Love it! Joone needs to mic up for these videos, I live for his one liners,
It’s so funny hearing your husband in the background 😂
People visit the support channel offline, happy everyone happy day
Your makeup looks so good I really really love the eye look
What brush is she using for the concealer
Gurllll did i hear you say hustle-a-baby ? Im deadddd 😂😂 but how do you hustle-a-baby rihanna?? 🤔 \nSending love from the Aussie outback 😅 not really tho 😎
Haha Jonye'  in the background ooooo, Eden..... 😂😂
nice
OHMYGOD! I LOVE YOU SIS 😭😭😭
Katy 💕🔥
Yas❣️❣️❣️❣️290-✨
Hot..new..shit
Love the Katy sign back there. Not a Huda fan since she does not promote women of color
Love this video!! What I like to do with the matchsticks is use my regular concealer that matches my skin and then I use the concealer stick to highlight a little and it works nicely on my skin. Maybe that could help?
THE KATY SIGN FROM THE UD COACHELLA HOUSE THOO! IF YOU REMEMBER THAT VLOG YOURE PROBABLY JUST AS OBSESSED WITH KATY AND DESI AS I AM 😂
What morphe brush do you use to buff out the concealer under the eye?
So if this is Katy putting hot new sh*t on her face, is this Katy getting sh*t faced? 🤔
Not even 5 minutes in but I love joons commentary
what *is* the standard primer you use?
This background is perfect!! 🦄
Video title for no makeup vid: SOME MAKEUP MAKEUP
I loved this look!!! You look gorgeous!
You should try Estée Lauder double wear nude water whatever for your no makeup but makeup look!!
yes to the “No Makeup Makeup” !!!
100% castor oil works like a dream for your brows and eyelashes!!! You'll see results after a month.. 👌🏼 doesn't sound convincing but I promise it works hahaha
Why ARE so many lashes named Samantha?? 😂😂😂
Beautiful woman.
Your trending 💕💕💕💕❤️❤️❤️❤️
That background 😍❤
Jonye's commentary always providing extra entertainment!
Trending #22 yaaaaassss slayyyy
Make a tut on the fenty beauty red make up look! It was 🔥
Take it there.. live your life... don’t let anyone stop you!!!! Jonye
Thanks this stuff really covers my bruised face and ass
WHY IS HER RING ALWAYS ABOUT TO FALL OFF AND FACING THE WRONG WAY ??? lol
Can we just appreciate Katy's traps? 💪🏻🏋🏻‍♀️
I want your skin!! Omg! I struggle with big pores and white clogged pores.
Katy why must you be so beautiful!!!!! 😫😫😫😫😫😫 I can't take your beauty! Love the purple on your eyes! <3
I thought you said Copernicus but you said concernicus I'm dead 😂
LOVE this video...makes me crave some Huda pallet in my life. With those purples 🔮 😍....Quick QUESTION, What do you do with the 'Mean Money' side?? I have the same Fenty Killawatt and Its too light and isent visible when I try to use it for a 'lighter highlight'. 😘
Any small youtubers want to be friends I sub back
LOL Jonye: is it shapetape? \nYou taught him so well😂😂
Awesome vid! I don't suppose anyone would want to see a dog puppet's channel? 😁
Jon's side comments 😂 i live
That's kid and college stuff
Love the Huda Desert Dusk palette! OMG! Those mattes blend so easily. I was copying your look getting ready to go out but switched out the twilight for umm....put it away already. It was center left a shimmery golden bronze to go with the Amber. Love how it turned out! My first time using it, too!
i used a beauty blender dry for the first time with the UD all nighter and it actually came out pretty nice 😂
Looove this version of hot new shit! Also, I really love that finish on your skin, it's the perfect amount of glowiness without looking sweaty! Fab ❤️
Taking @katy to another level 😂😂🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
you should come up with a lash line!
Love the background! It’s simple, chick and non distracting 👍🏻
The setup is gorgeous
very chic
So pretty !!
Feeling the miley cyrus vibes👅
Love the look!!!

This loooook 😍 ooooo girl
#16 on Trending!!! Go Katy 💄💋
I love this background!!! Also please do the kind of no make up make up look!! Those are my favorite and you always look stunning. Also, another video idea! A video about undereyes!! I feel like I have the exact same issues u have, kinda dry and have dark circles exactly like yours. Know you love bye bye undereye but can't really afford it. So would be awesome to hear your favorite drug store options ans also like skin care u think helps u most.  Just an idea but I'm sure alot of us could beneift from your knowledge! ❤❤❤
Yaaasss! Please do the “kinda make up no makeup” tut!!!
I am always living for your videos girl! Purple moments are working for you btw. Yassss !
Come all the way through ssssamanthaa blinking beaut lash!
where did you get the katy sign in the back?!
Do any of you babes know the Morphe brush number that Katy uses allll the time to buff Concealer in?? I can never find a video where she says the number 🤷🏼‍♀️❤️✨
So pretty
You NEEEED to try the Shiseido Synchro Skin foundation. It's the best for no makeup makeup. The coverage is very light so if that's what you want, don't. But it's the best for everyday and it's soo pretty, light weight. I never hear anyone talk about it and it's the only foundation I've actually finished a bottle. IT'S SO GOOD!! 😍😍😍😍😍
I'm so ready for your line to come out! When & where will we be able to purchase it??? ❤️😍
https://youtu.be/DHGxs0r61Os

Everyone is waiting on that palette girl! 🤗
Christen Dominique please do the 20 Song Tag 😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️
Wow, what a beautiful look.  That pink is everything!
So, I've never been into makeup and I'm one of those idiots who says I don't need makeup but you made me love it! I'm new to all this but i love watching your videos, I can't seem to get into any other artists on here lol...anywho I had a question (anyone can hopefully answer) i struggle with oily skin and keeping my creases from showing even more but when I powder them and leave the powder to set, my eyes get irritated and water for the rest of the day...help! This seems to happen when I do anything around my eyes...i.e concealer, eyeshadow, mascara....is it just because this is all new and my eyes just need to get used to product being around them? Do I need special sensisitive makeup? I've tried multiple brands...
Any small or upcoming youtuber that would like to help one another? 💖
I loved this thank you Christen
HOW ARE YOUR TEETH SO WHITE OMG TELL ME UR SECRETS LOL
Hi Christine please list brushes you used!! Thank you!

Can one be more charming and beautiful - on the inside and outside?\nShe doesn't even need makeup.\nThanks for being yourself!
WHY DOES THIS GIRL LOOK LIKE VERONICA FROM RIVERDALE
Loveeeeee that comment at the end!!! Omg. Speaking to my soul! Thank you for that. ❤️

You look great w/o makeup! Not even sure why I clicked on the vid tbh....
This is why I take all my first dates to a pool.
My Dog had a litter of one and rejected him so I've been hand raising her puppy since day 1. I watch and rewatch your videos all the time and follow your Snapchat, now with a puppy on my chest. Well it turns out he's heard your voice so much in his two weeks of life that he perks up and reacts to hearing you now 😭😍 you've got a 2 wk old puppy fan!
always scares me a bit seeing how ppl can look completely different with makeup on
Love your eyes!!! 😍 where can I get contacts like that?! 😩
Omg, I would not want to be the guy that dates you and then wakes up the next day to a different face 😵😂😭
As a man I'd like to say all that make up is unnecessary she looked great without it and the makeup only makes her look like a trashy girl
Omg I did the same thing to eye last week im like ouch oh shit that's my skin lol
What song did she put at 0:13?
And then scare hell out of him when he sees you in the morning..... MIGTOW (:
this is why I have trust issues with girls. maybe stop being insecure and try going out without makeup one day.
0:47 who da foook is that guy?!!
Christen your skin is AMAZING!!!\nWhat have you been using?\n#beautiful
Love the pink lips
your skin looks sooooooooo good!!!!! talk about an improvement!!!!!😍😍😍😍✨✨✨✨✨
What brand is the lip stick?
Do you still do Halloween make up
You  look gorgeous😍 I Love all of your makeup😻😻 #quadfamily
hun, your nose contour on the thumbnail is not proportion 🤔
Please make a video testing Pacifica makeup, I;m thinking of purchasing from them and would love to see you test it out to see what you think of it! xxx
Her eyes are always pretty, lenses or not, just like her face, makeup or not.
Every time you play a song in your intro, it's always happens to be songs that I'm into... that's so freaky🙆🏻💋💋
You skin looks so flawless 😍 i soo love your videos.
Nope don't like it
I Love this makeup.
Geniales los padres
A Messi le toco bailar con el Maffeo
Que voz tan rica
A Ronaldo esto no le hace falta. Messi es unico
Jugar así es Maffeo.
el marcaje en individiual es una putada para el atacante y el defensor, pero quien haya jugado a futbol sabe que es una opción más. Igual si no le hubieran marcado así messi les mete 2 o 3 goles. Al final lo que cuentan son los 3 puntos, y no si juego como me gusta o no
Los fans de Cristianos son homosexuales reprimidos, lo admiran mas por su altura, su bronceado, sus musculos y por que es guapo.
QUE CRAK MESSI
Crack Maffeo porque nunca quiso párarlo apunta de patada \nEn cambio Pepe es mas feo que las ganas de cagar y rajero 😂😂
QUEDATE CON QUIEN TE CUIDE COMO MAFFEO A MESSI 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Messi no tiene a Deulofeu y entonces le traen a uno mafeo
bien por Mafeo, así se marca limpiamente y no a patadas
el mejor canal de youtube
Los marcajes individuales es una putada, no le dejas disfrutar al chaval, muy mal Machís
pues ni yo me le despegaría un segundo
Que le pida la camisa y el autógrafo entonces 😂😂, que triste la manera de jugar
por qe me encanta su voz?❤
Can some one translate in English what the players are saying?
What does this video mean in English??
Messi to man city soon
d
¡Mario sube el camino!
Ojaa viniera al barsa
Me parecio excelente lo de Maffeo,se preparo toda la semana para marcar a Messi y lo logro..ademas no pego una patada,lo anuló hasta donde pudo je.
por fin VIDEO DEL BARÇA POR FIN
Y le funcionó por que Messi no marcó aunque igual el Girona perdió jejeje
Pesiiiii!
Maffeo putoamo :v
Mario sube el camino
Hermoso video.
Maffeo desde colombia te apoyo.. fuerza campeon....
Kkk la sombra d messi😂
Mario sube el camino
Jajajajaja
Buen Messi 😂👑👏👏👏
Ahhhaahhahahahahahahaahhahahahahahahaha
substitle bitches
Tu voz me da sueño ;v
Zabaleta II
Zorba el griego
Los reportajes parecen novelas jaja
Maffeo tienen que comprarlo
Tú eres mi amigo fiel jajajajajajaja
1:11 catacrock .
Jajajaj
ni así pudieron ganar
City watch = life
Messi, Messi, Messi
Cuál era el chiste? Evitar que el Barcelona, te golee o que Messi no marcara gol? Porque si es la segunda sabiendo que puede pasar la primera, es un asco.
narración mas fea esta. este video no me gusto por eso
Yo creo que se combinaron muchas cosas buenas porque así como Maffeo nunca le llegó con mala intencion,Messi a su vez tampoco quiso hacerlo,y hay que ver que Messi con su habilidad lo habría podido hacer,Fair Play le llaman por ahí 😊😀
Estaba cagado del susto ese defensa. Demasiada responsabilidad si anotaba Messi. Hizo un buen trabajo!
Para jugar así que no juegue, desde el primer minuto pidiéndole perdón a messi menudo marica me daría vergüenza tener un jugador así
A ronaldo los tecnicos no le ponen marcas asi por que nole ponen atencion
Hay que ser retrasao para hacer un marcaje individual y hacerte colega de tu marcaje cuando lo que tienes que hacer es intimidarlo dentro del campo, en fin...
Genial que hagan vídeos así (Y)
Pobres los dos muchachos.  Maffeo por ratos casi llora tratando de enterder la magnitud de querer parar al mejor jugador del mundo mision casi imposible.   Muchas veces la profesion te lleva a cumplir roles realmente en contra de tus creencias.  Pero asi es la vida.  Ellos dos cumplieron y el Barcelona casi como siempre gano!
A ronaldo no hace falta ni qu lo marque el mas paquete del equipo, total los goles los falla solo
Que presión para maffeo, hay que destacar eso, te ordenan marcar los 90 minutos al mejor del mundo y sabes que en cualquier momento se te puede escapar.
Despues del partido me parece gracioso hubiese estado super gracioso que lo invitace a cenar con la familia
messi no le hizo gol al poderoso Girona??? que raro
Las dos mejores actitudes para una situación tan ingrata y poco vistosa. \nDos caballeros. Chapeau
corre con una cara de la concha de su madre ya se me fue este un padre nuestro y a ver si ocurre un milagro !
Quien es ma feo de los dos? Lo pilláis?\n😂😂
resultado  final de esta estrategia obsoleta? 0-3
Lo triste cuando los demás jugadores no tienes su lugar ganado es que los traen en modo robots/títeres & eso me enfada. Dejen a los futbolistas jugar como ellos se sientan cómodos. Dejen el fútbol ser un deporte, olviden el dinero por un rato.
Me gustaría ver a PABLO MAFFEO en el Barcelona... Mucho mas que a la MITAD de la plantilla actual del Barcelona. \nese MUCHACHO SI TIENE TALENTO, logreo PARAR EL 50% DEL PODER DE MESSI, y eso ya es decir MUCHO!\nTiene Buen marcaje, el chico. Y buena aptitud. Para mi un JUGADORAZO!
Estar a 7 puntos es una mierda
Qué buena clase tienen los que arman éste programa. Excelente. Siempre generan buen humor en quienes lo vemos. Gracias.
Maffeo marca a Cristiano y este le responde: Y quien eres tu? Yo soy el mejor, Xavi juega en Qatar...
Que estrategia mas mala del entrenador, en vez se marcar a un solo jugador, deberian marcara los que estan sueltos y no solo a uno, se que messi es el mejor y es el que mas peligro da pero bueno...
Jajajajjaj quizas no se vea bien el marcaje personal, pero logro de alguna manera evitar que messi tuviera un mejor partido xd. Me parecio chistoso, no se porque tantas quejas. Al fin y al cabo es futbol y esta para disfrutar xd
Reyna-maradona la original!!! Una copia exacta la de maffeo-messi y si q lo desaparecio!! eso aremos el 5 de octubre pero muchos anos atras mi viejo me cuenta q alguien se la izo al gran perico leon de ahi la copia un venezolano a maradona y de ahi viene la de reyna-maradona!! Increible cambio y fuera!!!
ajajajajajajajajajajaja que cosa mas agradable
Maffeo estaba hasta avergonzado, además de estar casi todo el partido a su lado, anulándolo, llega Portu y se queja, amos no me jodas! Y muy bien por Messi, por entenderlo y ser agradable.
Como Reyna a Maradona... Maffeo a Messi... y dicen que el marcaje personal no funciona...
Que hermoso es el futbol. Que conste que soy del Madrid
Jajaja que bueno rollo ese
0:40 Messi Que hago para sacarme a este de encima jajaja Grande Messi, Buen Partido de Maffeo cumplió con lo que le pidieron!
La verdad .  Messi y ese jugador mis respeto.. Jaajajajja lo disfrutaron..
Buenísimos los videos, desde Argentina
El no es el más bonito, el es el Ma' feo
Es Messi el que a marcado Maffeo 😂😂😂
La voz de la chica me la puso como brazo de albañil 👀💪
I don't understand spanish, somebody to translate to me please ? :'c
bueno le dio resultado 😯 Messi no hizo goles!
A Cristiano lo marcan asi porque Messi es mejor 😎😎😎😎
I DO NOT SPEAK SPANISH
Please translate it :'(
Que cancion suena en el min 1:55
DESCUBRE INFIDELIDAD Y REACCIONA VIOLENTAMENTE \nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_UNMTjoFvn0
Al Barcelona le faltó abrir el juego más a las bandas, por eso casi no tuvo opciones a la ofensiva.\nPero refiriéndome a Messi, siempre se la saca con las charlas a sus marcadores, parece que la pasan bien siempre los que marcan a Messi aunque no les vaya como lo esperaban ja buen partido de Maffeo
Tas loco , solo en Europa se ve eso. Acá en Sudamérica sabes como lo matan a patadas todo el partido?! Jaja y encima le tiran un :  “ levántate cagón , que ni te toque...” por eso le cuesta tanto acá, porque no lo miran , acá lo marcan en serio.
Por eso en sudamerica no triunfa;alla le piden disculpas por marcarlo, le muestran un respeto cercano al temor. Aca lo marcan de verdad y le dan leña. Es un crack Lio de todas formas
Marcaje personal es el futbol de antes y es efectivo.
mmm con esa voz y si esta exitada mamu te rompo toda
Ha anulado a Messi, lo resto es conversa. Grande Maffeo
Soy yo el entrenador y se va a la grada todo el año,  le ha faltado pedirle de rodillas lo siento...lamentable
Maffeo fue como si fuera una seleccion de sudamerixa, menudo pecho frio ese frionel xd
QUÉ VOZ MAS FEA...
wish you would be in canada this week with us man!! Miss you!! Killer footage as usual!
your videos make me want to quit my job and explore the world
These vlogs are awesome, just a shame they are so spaced out
You are fortunate you did not catch the grass on fire. Sometimes with that high grass gets into the exhaust system and starts a fire.
He always seems to have the best jams during car rides
Really wish Ben would daily vlogs again he was one of the best at it loved his contents and quite upsetting to say he’s gone from daily uploading to hardly ever uploading I’ve been watching him since he was on around 150k subs and he would be well over a million subs already if he still daily vlogged
Lovely intro, good episode. Amazed by your work. PLZ HIRE ME.
You and Nicole are brother and sister goals!!
Thumbs up just because of flume
Dope shots in the intro! You are the best and I really want to visit Africa after I've seen your videos :D
be careful with parasites in african rivers, discovery channel made me paranoid with that. lol
I love Hyppo and you just get awesome shots of them. In my mind I am already thinking how to do a similar road trip than you guys!
Love the subtitles. Honestly, if you keep up the snapchat or insta stores up, I think most fans will be content with those as vlogs!
that was so incredible Ben! Now all I want is to go on a roadtrip and explore the nature <3
Ha! I just got that same headlamp. Aren't all those settings confusing? Love the visuals in the beginning Ben.
4:45 Oh... that's a real place, I thought you were Joking! ... haha looks nice!
Awesome Ben! I'm a photographer living in Zimbabwe, check out my instagram! @harry.randell
Who else liked the video before even watching it?
utube should really promote such channels. Good stuff Ben! Keep em coming
What lens did you use for that intro? It was sick
Amazing visuals like always! Cheers Ben. Crazy to say but your T-shirt that I purchased from you I haven’t worn it once.
I’m from Zim! This vlog makes me miss it so much
Got that Isaiah Rashad blasting. I see you!
i must say... i'm having a bit of a crush on cam.... ><\nwish the video was in 4k for the intro bit the visuals are SO BEAUTIFUL!
The wait is so worth it! So glad that you take your time to put these incredible images together. Great job on the colors. The croc in the beginning is a killer. :)
Best way for us to live that trip again.\nHow did you get passed the column of ants? Did you drive through it?
What was that animal at 00:50 ??
In Argentina when in 2009 they introduced the bus ticket machines / dispensers on buses, they would only accept coins so of course, the shortage of coins began. People would queue in banks to change notes / bills into coins to pay for the bus fare. Some banks would reach their quota of how many coins they would give out a day so you'd have to go to stands around the city to get change and in some of those places in order to get 10 one peso coins they would ask for 12 pesos or even more and many had no choice if they couldn't wait in banks for a 10 for 10 exchange.  Then in 2011 they brought in the SUBE card to pay for transport fares; you put money in your SUBE card and then pay your fare using that. \n\nIt's sad when some people take advantage like that because in my eyes it's the same as stealing and the people who suffer the most are those who are struggling in the first place because if you're loaded, you're probably carrying the cash on you so you can avoid being ripped off or you know a guy who knows a guy who can cut you a deal. \n\nWe have a saying Hecha la ley, hecha la trampa, meaning as soon as there's a law or a rule for something, someone is going to come up with a smart way to break it for their own profit. I think in English you say Every law has a loophole.
Hey Ben, another great video! Was wondering how all these lodges in the middle of nowhere power themselves?
I honestly don't know how you haven't reached 1 million subscribers, quality video as always ⚡️⚡️
You're visiting my home Country ... You need to see Matopos National Park, about 50km outside Bulawayo
such good vibes bro!!! Your the best!
I would have been nervous on an overgrown road like that...  as w found out, it means people don't use that road.  Amazing that it actually did end up going somewhere!  Cool croc and hippo shots!
Looking forward to tomorrow's vlog. aka 3/4weeks. :) Keep up the amazing work Mr. Brown!
Beautiful and wonderful as always :)
Yohhhhhhhhh!!!! Ben this is incredible and I cannot wait for the Kenya film. It's going to be another level. Don't let people pressure you into editing the vlogs in their time. This is a special trip and the fact we can even see/be apart of it is special.
Hahaha the captions when the mic wasn‘t plugged in xD I love your videos Ben, you’re the biggest inspiration for me! Made it to 640 Followers so far 💪😊
This is what YouTube was made for. Not some crappy diss tracks or boring videos. Thx for being you Ben and always producing quality and beautiful content
Can we just get some appreciation for the depth of field in those first shots, sharp shooting B.B \nAwesome work 👌🏽👌🏽
Wow the quality of the footage is amazing!!!
i feel bad those days and seeing that video made me feel peaceful for a bit thx
Ben. I love your positive attitude, your amazing eye for photos, your badass editing skills, and the fact that you share bits of your life with us! Nicole is fantastic and Cam seems cool too. Watching your vlogs just feels good!
Yes ben! the intro looks like a little visual vibes!
Please watch my videos i have no friends :(
Very very good video man keep going \nI love your channel sooo much 😍😍
Great video Ben. Need a defender in my life
Rockin that old school music by KAASI from your old vlogs hehe. Great video as always Ben, cheers.
The Zim cash crisis isn't Mugabe's fault, at least not this time. He's too old to even function which is why his wife is running the country now and she's so much worse! She's the reason Zimbabwe's going through another cash crisis right now just like they did back in 2008.\n\nIn other news, This vlog is siiiiick! Man literally cannot wait for the Visual Vibes to drop!
Thanks for visiting where I come from
Karibu Kenya ☀ cant wait for the visual vibes of the trip
classic KAASI song :) it reminds me of your old vlogs
Ben you're the OG! Love your work and cant wait to watch another visual vibes
When the visual vibes coming out
Nice one bro , cheers for showing our home Zim in a positive way.
Love the vibes on the intro and always love seeing you post a video. Just curious how behind are the vlogs right now? Because I know you aren't in Africa anymore. No biggy love the vids!
Hey Ben! I think there is way more potential for the `Kenia expedition` Pumba logo type of thing! I bet there´s someone out there that can make you a animated intro, which in my opinion would fit the professionality of you videos in general better than just a fade/in fade/out logo. Please consider this if you wanted to use it in your Visual Vibes. Keep killing it :)
Can you please bring back your old outro's I miss not being told to work hard, be nice to people, and try not to get lost or killed.
I can't wait to watch 'tomorrow's vlog' whilst tucking into my Christmas dinner
Man one day I'll do something like this!!
How much did you spend on the whole trip?
amazing is all i have to say
What an adventurous road you drove not certain where it would take you or where you'd end up. You've got abundant explorer genes. I'm not out of bed yet and I've driven down an uncertain African road. Thanks Ben, Nicole, and Cam. 👊👍😎👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
So beautiful, there's no words to describe it... it deserves a like just for the mic off part and the subtitles XD lol
This is the Type of Youtuber how should get Millions of subs!!!
Amazing Videography as always Ben. Still the line of these trip Vlogs. Ben saying (Jokingly!) “I want to find one of those stripey horses”!!! Hilarious I’ve not stopped laughing. hilariously funny. 🤣🤣
Whoop whoop whoop what I've been waiting for a vlog can not wait for the Visual vibes 😀💯🔥👍🏿
Amazing intro. Can watch it over and over again, it’s hypnotizing.
This is amazing content Ben. I appreciate you sharing your vision to the world.
I love my country man! Hopefully things will change soon.
You really need to see the south of botswana in the deep kalahari instead of just going to maun and the north keep up the good vids anyway though ⚡️
My home country!I miss it so much!Thank you for showing us the beauty of Africa!
So good to see you happy
Hope you guys had fun, Steve and Wendy are family friends. I know they really enjoyed having you guys there
Cinematogography is another level. Killing it, Ben. Ever since the Arctic vlogs, I always celebrate when you upload. 🙌🏼\nThe subtitles on the boat though. 😂😆
Thanks Ben nice vlog like ever

Luv your stuff!
lol wow... wow   \n\nanyone else catch that?
the focus and depth of field at the start is pure sex fml
The cash situation is not all that bad for the general people.  Illegal activity is conducted in cash.  The more the general population conducts its business electronically the better.
How much fuel does the Defender hold?
I did quite like Golden Circle. Obviously not as much as the first Kingsman, and I agree with your comparisons between the two - however I still enjoyed the humour of the film, and the odd emotional scenes (eg. Mark Strong).  But I understand where you're coming from in the fact that this movie didn't need a second instalment - all part of the sequel culture of Hollywood.
Saw it yesterday. I wondered about the direction after the first film (which, let's face it, did have its own set of issues), but there isn't really any, and the laddish humor really got stale very very quickly. Certainly not an all-out bad film, but one of the big disappointments of this year for me.
This was. So true the first one was so good and the sequel was a complete shitshow
I hold Jack's film opinions very highly. I usually agree with him on everything. He is very precise, particular and like any good filmmaker knows what the hell he is talking about. Every point he made was valid and when I saw the film prior to watching this review I agreed. Bringing Colin Firth back removes the consequences, Poppy does fall easily once all her henchmen are gone, and the treatment of women in this film is sub par to say the least. But at the same time I did enjoy the film. I laughed at moments and felt enticed with where the film was going. Apart from style choices like fight scenes and the unconventionality of the villain this felt removed from the Kingsman series. Like it was just some other separate spy movie. It relied more on it's flash of celebs and cgi toys like the Statesman HQ rather than it's jokes on the spy film archetype. That being said I had fun. It won't hold the same place in my heart as the first but it is a film I would watch again.
YES. It felt like they killed Roxy and Merlin unnecessarily just to make up for the fact that they couldn't commit to having killed Harry in the first one. Halle Berry and Jeff Bridges didn't do anything in this movie, and they weren't even in a coma for half of it. And really, Pedro Pascal's character's motivation for turning on them was one of the laziest things I've seen. \n\nI loved the first movie so much, so I'm right there with you in being so disappointed by this one.
I couldn't agree more with ur points tbh I was really disappointed
GOD i absolutely agree with this. i seriously contemplated walking out less than halfway through because it didn't feel like it was going to do anything even remotely funny or memorable.
I really loved Kingsman. Saw the trailer for The Secret Circle and was bitterly disappointed. \nI really respect your honest review of the film and agree with a lot of the points you make in this video. I don't think I'll pay money to go watch this. I legit could not care less about Channing Tatum being in the film- personally I found that in the run up to this film being released he was plugged the most (if that makes sense?). There was too much emphasis on big names than trying to have a witty and meaningful storyline.
Took the words out of my mouth. I am a massive fan of kingsman. Like with no exaggeration I could happily say I've watched it 30+ times (idk how), and so when I saw it I had this unexplainable feeling of disappointment. I put this aside cause like all the reviews are pretty much positive, and the people I went to see it with (who aren't big kingsman fans) enjoyed a lot. But it feels as though they made this one for money and forgot the point of eggsy's character. I wanted to see more of eggsy's past, what happened growing up, and yet all I got was a posher version of him with no other character development really. I'm so glad other people understand this cause everyone else just seems to worship it
Thank you so fucking much for saying everything I've been thinking
The film was fantastic. Everything a sequel should be and it showed great respect to the original movie while adding some new elements/characters. Kingsman 2 is the best movie sequel since Winter Soldier.
I aggressively agreed with literally everything in this review like he literally put my exact thoughts into words from this movie.
I totally agree, so disappointed with almost everything. So sad
Oh man I agree with almost everything, except that I did somewhat enjoy it but the thing that annoyed me most is that THERE IS NO SNOW IN THESE MOUNTAINS IN JUNE, WHEN GLASTONBURY TAKES PLACE, god that still annoys me so much
Im so glad im not one of those people that watch films so technically and so nit-picky. Im not hating, im just genuinely glad because i like to enjoy movies instead of pick out flaws that your average joe wouldnt care about or notice. The first one was better, of course, but the golden circle wasnt bad and i had a bloody great time watching it. Im glad harry hart was back and it was an interesting way of bringing him back. I was devastated when roxy and merlin died because they were like the people on the side who dont steal the show but they were essential to giving the movie the heart and friendship it needed. I knew when i heard about the american cast that they were going to be unnecessary and they kind of were. Anyone could have played their roles (excluding julianne moore because i think she was great). Im looking forward to the third one theyre planning because i cant help but love the movies
Man, I couldn't agree more. My friends wouldn't stop going on about how they GENUINELY LIKED IT MORE THAN THE FIRST and I was like wtf...?. It certainly wasn't a terrible movie, but it really didn't match the first. An okay, but forgettable movie.
I normally respect your opinions Jack but I gotta say, I think you’re being entirely too harsh on this one. I went to see it last night (I was gonna see it regardless, I’m a huge Vaughn fan) and while it wasn’t as good as the first (when are they?) it was still a solid film.\n\nI agree that they shouldn’t have brought Harry back and they certainly shouldn’t have spoiled it in the trailers. The finger condom scene really wasn’t as bad as all that. Channing was in it for a fair amount, not just 2 minutes at the start and again at the end. Elton John was a poor choice, I don’t really understand that one.\n\nAll in all I’d give it a solid 4/7. Not the perfect 5/7 that the first film got, but good enough. I just wish Matt decided to do sequels before Kick-Ass 2 got wrecked. Hopefully he’ll come back and give Kick-Ass 3 a go.
I fell like because the first one was so amazing, the fact that the second one wasn't as good did make it look a lot worse. If they do, do a third film, I hope they make up for what they have done in the second one.
I completely agree with the whole narrative structure difference of the first film and the sequel. I've seen Kingsman: Golden Circle twice now and I definitely preferred the first over this one. Admire their efforts of making a sequel, it's a ballsy move, but I just prefer the first's creativity.
Ok but like why do you hate every single film 😂
I completely agree with you! I absolutely love the first film but I just didn't get the sequel. There were a lot of moments where I questioned why they were doing X,Y,Z and undoing all the amazing work of the first film. It was just a bit..... weird to be honest
Like everything else these days... it's lazy, leaned too much on the first film, I even felt Eggsy was out of character most of the film, similar villainous plot...  Yeah, the slipping in the tracking device scene was a bit much.  I too think Vaughn messed up here :(
i loved the film, but there was no point bringing colin firth back from the dead. elton was a bit far. taron egerton, in my opinion, is an amazing actor, but the first film will always be better. i liked the references to the first film, but i struggle to see how it was only a 15? especially with the tent scene
I agree with everything you said but I still managed to enjoy it. It wasn't as good as the first one but I wouldn't say I was disappointed either. I think because the first film holds a special place in my heart (I'd say it's one of my favourite films of all time), I had a soft spot for this one too. I always knew I'd hate the American stuff though. One of the main things that made me fall in love with The Secret Service was the British grit. I liked the fact Eggsy was a chav from a council estate. He was rough and ready, but he was real. There's that stereotype that British men are always so charming and prim and proper, but this showed everyone what most young British men are really like. Haha 😂 I wanted to see more of that roughness here. I also didn't like all the new gadgets. It seemed like they had a gadget for literally everything (just not one for disarming a landmine, clearly). And all of Poppy's robots, ugh. I know it's fictional and anything goes, but the robots felt so fake. One last thing (apart from all the deaths, sad face) I didn't like was Eggsy's relationship with the Princess. I didn't think all that was necessary or added anything to the film. I loved the scenes between Eggsy, Merlin and Harry though. It is weird that Harry is back but he was so great in the first one, I couldn't bare to see him go so early. Their scenes made it feel like the first film again. The humour from the first film is still there in this one, and I think Taron plays the role of Eggsy perfectly once again. I think I'm just going to hold on to the scenes between the OGs, and just hope that they go back to the realness of the first film for the next one. 😊
This video is exactly why I watch you. Completely agree on this film.
I don't get the love for the first Kingsmen movie either.... Found it over the top and unrelatable, and I usually enjoy a good action comedie. Anyone with me?
I found myself laughing at how awful and disconnected some parts of the film were (mainly the parts where Elton John added nothing to the scene...) but I did enjoy it. I'm not sure if this is just because I'm invested in some of the characters from the first film though. I left feeling odd, but not like I had wasted 2 hours of my life.
I didn't feel that Elton john belonged there and I'm heartbroken about the deaths of Roxy and Merlin. But there's another things that's been bothering me and now that I've noticed it I can't stop thinking about it: they HAD to make Halle Berry one of the Statesmen because by the end of the second film she is the ONLY female character whose sole purpose ISN'T to be someone's mum or girlfriend. Even the Kingsman sign est 1848 bothers me because in 1848 there hadn't been a King for 11 years. I realise Kingsman sounds better but then why not just set it in 1836?
My thoughts exactly! Such a disappointment.
Matthew Vaughn produced Eddie The Eagle with Taron as Eddie and it was AWESOME.  Eddie is so loveable and you feel for him.
The Golden Circle sucked. Suck is the key word. The first Kingsman was the best. Please.....no more. This last one was the killer of any future Kingsman movies.......at least I hope.\n\nThe grinding up of humans into hamburgers was Jeffery Dahmeresque. Is eating humans to be funny? The hitting on Colin Firth's character by Elton John was to be funny? It was not.  No naked Halle Berry?  Such a shame. It was a complete disaster and a waste of 2.5 hours.
I liked the movie but idk I didn’t really like how Roxy and the rest of the kingsman died because surely they can detect a missile before it hits like come on it was just an easy death
I agree so much with this! Like almost everything, except Elton Johns jump kicks. Didnt love them, but didnt hate them, haha. \n\nI actually sat wondering when Roxy was going to show up again because they are going to bring Harry back so she could have jumped away from that missile that erased the whole house from the face of the earth
I feel like this video could've been half an hour long with all the bullshit that went on in the movie
I have never loved a film more than Kingsman the secret service but i too agree with your opinion here. Being a huge fan of the first one and being so obsessed with it i cant bring myself to hate the new one because i feel like i would be betraying myself but it just wasn't anywhere near as good as i had wished. Such a shame.
I haven't seen the new Kingman film yet, but this well describes my fear for the second Pacific Rim film
One of the things I didn't understand was how kingsman and statesman didn't know about each other. They are practically the same organisation with very similar technology. AND they're supposed to be intelligence organisations, surely they should know about their counterparts in other countries?!?
When I started watching this I couldn't think of any reasons to slate this film...but now I've heard your views you've swayed me 😬
I agree with a lot of the points - especially that the action in this one just seemed to be fighting. It wasn't getting switched up at all. However, I thought Elton John was a welcome difference from the blandness of what was going on. Also, I think Matthew Vaughn pays homage to comics through his shooting skill so slow motion of movement in the fights or a character directly looking to the camera, I think, is a reflection of this. \nIt was an unfortunate film to choose to create a sequel for given how brilliant the first film was
Enjoyed the film, but agree with basically everything said here. I dont really understand why half the story choices made were made, half of them undermined the previous film and the other half were just infuriating. Also Merlin and Roxy deserved better.
I understand its better to have strong views either way but I do think this is a *tiny* overreaction? Yes, the film does not meet up to the first Kingsman, but was it ever going to really? I think the references to the first films and tropes made the film and it felt so nice to be back in the Kingsman world with some new material. As for the fingering scene, I agree it was too much but this did not really impact how I feel about the film. I cried twice, laughed loads and it's the fact it's so ridiculous and nonsensical that makes it so endearing for me. I agree with all that you said, however, there were enough good parts of the film to make it for me an enjoyable and fun viewing experience. I for one would love to see another return of the Kingsman and I would definitely recommend fans of the first film go and see it. Not gonna lie when I saw the word 'rant' in the title of this video my heart sank a bit because I loved the movie x
Just came back from seeing this film and couldn't agree more with your review. One of the main things I couldn't understand was killing off Roxy! Seriously they spent so much time on her character development in the first film and got everyone on board rooting for her as the super kick ass female lead. To then kill her off and replace her with Hallie Berry.. they were like shit we don't have enough women in this film let's throw Hallie in there. Disappointing 😔 Also poor Pedro Pascal he was barely in the trailer or on any of the posters but did majority of the acting out of the other big stars... rant over!
Watch Now Kingsman: The Golden Circle Full Movie 2017: https://t.co/ZfdVMIAOws
Welp, glad I just agreed to see this tonight. What's super worrying is I tend to agree with 99% of Jack's opinions on films.
I honestly really enjoyed the movie because the entire 2 hrs and 20 minutes i didnt get bored or tired of watching, but i did find that human emotions were stripped away especially after the kingsman locations were attacked by the golden circle missiles. There was no mourning of those characters who had been initially introduced as important and it felt as though the movie was rushed to include everything so they skipped emotion. I really enjoyed the extravagant fight scenes and found myself super involved in the diegetic effect of the film up until the end
literally i was so so so excited to watch this film as i bloody love the first one but now I'm not sure. I shall demo go watch it. Even before i watched this film i though the same thing about colin firth like i saw him in the trailer or something and i was like the hell man!? but we shall see
I absolutely agree with the fact that they unnecessarily brought back Colin Firth's character. And they didn't even do it cleanly, they spoiled it in the trailers, months before the film even came out. So when it was revealed in the film, you knew it was going to happen and it completely ruined the surprise factor it was trying to create.
I had a feeling this would happen, something about the vibe and construction of the trailers didn't feel like it rang true to what made the first Kingsman brilliant (almost a lack of sincerity? not sure what to call it)
Personally, I hadn’t seen the first film so my knowledgable friend had to explain the ‘dog bit’ to me later. But I loved it, maybe I would have loved it less if I’d have seen the first one. But still I really enjoyed the action scenes and the plot. I agree about Elton but you’ve got to admit he’s bloody hilarious. I really enjoyed all the characters and the progression of the characters. Especially Merlin, to the point where I was crying at his death.
Haven't watched you for a while as you just seemed to pander to film companies but YAAAY intelligent critique!
Completely agree! The first movie was so strong! This one fell flat :( such a shame.
you make a lot of good points! it wasn't as great as the first one but it was definitely still fun to watch. there was a bit of the movie where i was kind of skeptical, i wasn't really sure how i felt about it and it got a bit slow. at the time, i didn't understand why i was just not feeling it but i think your points put it together nicely. that being said, i still think it was a good film and was pretty entertaining. honestly, i walked in expecting it to take the piss out of a lot of things so i didn't take it as seriously, which was part of what made it fun. \n\nalso, just to add! i can see your point about how bringing big name actors just felt like it was for poster, but i also feel like it represented america pretty well. i lived in america for a while and things can be......very over the top and showy....subjectively speaking, it's not my cup of tea. i felt like it was a bit much, and as you said, it felt like it was mainly for the posters, but it was very american of them and i think it fit that aspect of the film? if that makes any sense haha
This!!! This is everything I was thinking but have been afraid to say, because all of my friends are MASSIVE Kingsman fans and loved the sequel.
I would just pretend that there is no kingsman 2 😒
Thing is, i actually agree with basically all of your points, but i genuinely did enjoy myself *while* watching it. I was sort of distracted by how fun and high-octane it was ya know? But, now that i've had a few days to let it sink in, i've taken a step back and realized why a lot of people are disappointed. I'm not as attached to the original as you and many others seem to be, which may be why i'm not as gutted by the sequel. \nFor me, it comes down to this: i enjoy both films separately and for different reasons, but when comparing them side by side, i can't help but focus on the flaws of the sequel. \nOne last thought: i love Merlin as much as the next guy but i swear to god, if they bring him back in the next one i will RIOT IN THE STREETS
Damn I agree with everything you said but I still liked it and I don't know how to feel about that
it got hollywood-ed, which doesn't have to be a bad thing but, it means compromises and for kingsman it didn't work. I think one of the best parts of Matthew Vaughn's films is always the balance between well-known actors in surprising roles and relatively unknown actors, but with kick ass 2 and kingsman the golden circle you lose that, like losing a little spark. Elton John i just really don't get
Kingsman Golden Circle appears to be the Cursed Child of the Vaughn and Goldman team...
As someone who hadn't seen the first kingsman film until after going to see the second one yesterday, I went into it with no expectation... and came out with possibly a film now in my top 10 favourites. I finished watching the first kingsman film about 10 minutes ago and I think they are both absolutely smashing.
I think what really drove the first film was the characters and how much heart they had. You cared about Eggsy, not only because of Taron's acting skills, but because he was more than just a chav people pegged him to be and it was his relationships with those around him that made him a lovable action hero. He cared deeply about his mom and little sister, in fact, you could argue that they were his driving force to better himself, but you get none of that growth or pay off in this film- or only a little of it anyways. The sequel would have been so much better in a myriad of ways if it had focused on Eggsy and his family post-Valentine and all that and how they fared, not on his sudden relationship with Tilde, who while was an interesting character on her own, became quickly diluted to 'spy-hero's girlfriend'. You can have all the fun action, spy movie stuff in the sequel while also having the stakes be laid or around Eggsy's family and his other relationships that had been already established in the first movie (i.e. Roxy who deserved much better than she got and whose friendship with Eggsy was apparently not worth much to keep around in order to make way for big names that only clutter the film, not make it better). It would have been much better to explore these characters more while, of course, adding a big, bad, spy movie-esque villain in another way, but it was so, so key to remember who these characters where and what gave them so much heart and soul and to not just take what you think people loved about them and amp it up unnecessarily. I adore the first film, in fact, I would call it one of my favorite films of all time, but to take something that was so good and to create almost a caricature of it with the sequel is so disheartening.
I enjoyed it quite a bit, there were a lot of flaws but it was still fun, not as good as the first one, I brought my family and they enjoyed it too. Just bring in people that wont take it seriously.
As always Jack, I can't help but agree with your points (we must have similar tastes in film!). I enjoyed The Golden Circle for raw entertainment value, but even while watching it I knew it was nothing compared to The Secret Service. Everything that was different and quirky about the first film was lost in this one, I felt. But Taron Egerton is lovely so I'll overlook it for him 😂
Sorry, but I absolutely loved Kingsman 2. Will probably see it at least 2 more times in the cinema.
I think one of the biggest gripes I had was that it felt like the Statesman took the front seat in this (maybe because of the high profile American actors?). Enormous amounts of effort put into the Statesman while (in lack of a better word) devalueing the Kingsman and killing off two great characters to make room for the Statesman (More pissed about R rather than M, at least *he got a decent send off). I'm kinda 50/50 on the Colin Firth thing. I do agree with you that takes away a lot from the first movie but on the other hand the chemistry between Taron and Colin is really good and I love watching the two together on screen. Definitely agree about the fight scenes. None of them stood out to me unlike the scenes from the first one.
Completely agree with everything you said, they completely missed the mark and I'm so disappointed! 😔
Personally while I understand your criticisms and actually notices some of those points during the film, I found enjoyment of the film outweighed the annoyance. Mathew Vaughn has a style I just absolutely love, though my favourite of his is probably Layer Cake
i agree with everything you said but i still liked it.\ni just honestly think they could've let colin firth be dead and not killed roxy instead. like would that have been so difficult she was cool, and capable, and alive, and bringing ppl back from the dead ALWAYS takes the tension out of any plot for me. bc who cares anymore?\n\nbut, that said, i still really enjoyed watching it. i wasn't too invested in the first place so it was just a funny movie to watch, even though it had its faults
They definitely amped up the violence in this one which was probably to target the fanboys but the scene at the end where whiskey is thrown in the shredder is just completely unnecessary. I expected there to be a fight but I just think they went a little too far as I don't believe that's what Eggsy and Harry's characters would have done.
100% agree. I still hope that if there is another sequel, it completely smashes it, but thats a bit unlikely
Saving this video until I’ve watched the film!!
Nah one of my favourite films what are you chatting
Not hating on the princess but I just don't understand how they could choose to give her more screen time and development over our best girl Roxy? For an action movie, you would think they'd prioritize the awesome partnership/dynamics between Eggsy and Lancelot as Kingsmen instead of a romantic relationship between Eggsy and Princess Tilde that had little to no chemistry and is mostly just used to show us sexy time.
Honestly I went into this film not remembering much about the first one and really enjoyed it, but now that you mention all this I completely agree :/
Fuck them for killing Roxy in such a quick and pathetic manner
While I enjoyed The Golden Circle, I agree that it just wasn't up to par with the first movie. This one had humor and some good fights scenes, but it really couldn't hold a candle to the first in terms of uniqueness and a well thought out plot. I consider Kingsman to be one of my favorite movies, but the sequel is a let down. It's enjoyable, but not something I'd go out of my way to see again.
I watched the film yesterday and felt disappointed with a few things. I absolutely loved the first kingsman so couldn't wait for the next one. I 100% agree about Colin Firth as I think they shouldn't have brought him back although I found it emotional when he regained his memory again. I also think the fight scenes were the same a lot of the time. I also agree with the actors all being famous and recognisable, would have been nice to see a range of different actors. Although I was disappointed with a few things, overall I enjoyed it a lot.
I loved Elton John in it I thought it was so stupid it was hilarious I think you just have to watch it expecting it to be ridiculous and not try and compare it to the 1st one but a agree there was no point in having channing tatum in it
I went with a lot of my friends to see this movie, bc we all bloody loved the first one.... aaaand we all tried to act like we were semi-happy at the end? But it sucked so badly 😭
There are as many memorable action scenes in this one as there were in the first. For example, Taxi fight/chase, Manners Maketh Man Kentucky Style, Whiskey's Solo, Storming Poppyland on Wednesday, Diner fight against SPOILER, more etc.
Couldn‘t agree more! I didn‘t even go in with high expectations, because you know a sequel usually isn‘t as good- and I was still so massively disappointed :(
I am truly so thankful for your abillity to review films with not only a passion, but in such a respectful way (thinking back to your video/interview with Matthew) \nYou put, to 99%, my thoughts on these films into words and in a much smarter, broader way than I can. So thank you - I can often forward people to your channel if they want a film-review👍🏻😉😊 \n\nSPOILERS AHEAD!\n\nTo the movie it self:\nThis was one of my top 3 most anticipated movies of the whole year. Kingsman is one of the best films I've ever seen, and truly love everything about it (minus the last 3 minutes...) \nSo when a sequel was in the works I was so excited already. \nBut when I walked out of the theater I felt that feeling you described - the punch in your gut from it not at all being anywhere near as AMAZING as the first one.\nThis feels like a different movie all together, it didnt have any of that spark of cartooney-fun with a dash of english style and class. \nInsted the Golden Circle felt like a bit of a joke. Lets talk about a scene in the very start: for example, when Eggsy jumps down in shit (literally) to get to a birthday dinner for hus friend (who we never met in the first movie) and he brings his girlfriend, the Swedish princess with him. \nShe, a PRINCESS, hangs out in juciy couture in a council-estate, with not a guard in sight or even mentioned...\n\nOR howabout the fact that the Statesmen, who are suppose to be Kingsman's cousins, couldnt figure out during a whole year that Harry was a Kingsman? \nReally?😑😒\n\nFor me the story didnt add up half the time, the dialog felt much more americanized and not classy/smart at all, the american actors were wasted, the action scenes were to many and forgetful (like Jack pointed out) \nThe film as a whole was WAY to long! I wanted it to be 30 min shorter, and it would not have made it bad (or worse...)\nThe positives were the look of the film (visually, the cinemotography is great) some of the gadgets/inovation of tech was clever and cool, and I think Mark Strong and Taron Egerton (Colin Firth to some part) played their roles great (but the storyline failed and even their performances couldnt save that.)\nThats it. \n\nSo yeah, unbelivebly disapointed sums up this movie for me.
jack please do one on i.t. mate
I'm so glad someone feels the same as me about this
I agree 100% with everything you just said.
SPOILERS:\n\nI agree with the point about Colin Firth but I was still glad to see him back. I actually loved the movie but I see all your points and kind of agree with them on some level. They didn't recreate the magic of the church scene sure, but the final assault on PoppyLand and that one-take (style - I know there were cuts) fight with Whiskey to the country remix of Word Up is probably one of my favourite things from both movies. I will say that I found the first film more enjoyable as a whole. I hope they bring back Roxy and Merlin if they make another too, even though it would further defy everything the movie is. I love Merlin as a character and I think Roxy needs a significantly bigger role in everything. \n\nFinal note: COUNTRY ROOOOOOOOOOOADS!
I enjoyed it for the most part, but I hated the fact that they killed Roxy, who is one of the limited female cast members, and the only one that would have seen any physical action. We could have had a powerful female character in this movie, but it just turned into a boys club all over again. Look, I loved the cast, I thought it was fun, and it had its good moments, but it killed characters unnecessarily, it alienates its audience with crude sex puns (i.e. the underwear scene), and doesn't live up to what the first one held. They needed to take what the first film said about itself, it isn't the classic spy movie, so don't make it one.
I LOVED the first Kingsman UNTIL the anal scene. It completely ruined the movie for me. I should've known it was a funny nod to other movies, but it wasn't necessary. It felt so out of place. Needless to say, I didn't watch the second.
Raised some good points but I disagree. I REALLY liked Golden Circle (not as much as the first Kingsman) and there are some things I'm unhappy about (like why kill off every Kingsman but Harry and Merlin?, why is the Swedish Princess still around?, did the Elton John jokes go on too long?) but I think it had a good story and Taron Egerton in his role of Eggsy is a character I want to see more of
I thought killing of Roxy like that was such a complete waste of a really good character from the first one.
I COULDNT AGREE MORE. I loved the first, and this one omg I was so sad that it was terrible. It felt like it was trying to hard to be funny and then tried to hard to be a sky film
Definitely don't understand why they bought back Colin Firth because then watching the first one again loses its edge because you know he's not dead. Also agree with the big Hollywood names... WHY! Just have one big name and focus on the story
i really enjoyed this film, i had a great time with it but i guess i can see why people aren't enjoying it as much
And again, in hindsight, Mark Kermode was right.
oh no, i’m so disappointed! thanks for the heads up !
I enjoyed it a lot still not as good as the first one unfortunately but still a very good film. With all of these 'flaws' I just look at it like they're parodying all films which I mean... they are. It's all making a joke out of spy and superhero films all of the cameos and silly ways of bringing people back and all the fights its done all the time but they just amplify it a ton more in this. I guess everyone sees it differently.
It's weird. I agree with everything you said yet I still really enjoyed watching it.
I never saw the first Kingsmen, so with nothing to compare it to I thought the Golden Circle was great! I enjoyed how it was different from other spy movies, mostly by adding in more humor, and I was greatly entertained by it. That being said, after watching your video I want to go back and watch the first one and see if my opinion of Golden Circle changes. A lot of the stuff you criticized, like the cheesiness of Elton John, I assumed was in the first one as well.
meh
same. *sigh* ... same.
It needed a hell of a lot more of a build up. In the first one when it's starting to become clear what Valentine's plan is, you think 'oh shit, everyone is going to die' and it's genuinely stressful and there's actual emotional connections with Eggsy's mum and his little sister (the scene where she is bashing down the bathroom door still stresses me), but in this one it felt like nothing was going to happen the entire time? I wasn't worried for Tilde because her part in the film made no fucking sense anyway.
STOP WITH ALL THE INJECTIONS PLEASE, You don't need any of it. It's starting to make you look weird 😕
L’Oréal inflicts so much cruelty onto animals to test the “safety” of their ingredients and it’s burning people’s skin?😂 Wtf are the animals even for then? What a waste🙄
It's pretty pathetic to click on someone's video only to speak bad about them 🙄 anyway I actually really enjoyed your palette & it's pretty damn affordable to me. It's been the only one I've used since I got it when it first launched. Never used this green color tho, I'm excited to recreate this look 😍😍😍
First video of yours that I have ever seen. New subscriber here
I love you babe
rlly don't understand people being so sensitive to everything jaclyn does. there is NO way she can please every single person who views her videos. constructive criticism is SO much more beneficial than hate so stop :) being :) rude :)
Jaclyn hill what products do you use for your hair?!
Jaclyn you are by far my favorite beauty influencer! I started watching your channel over 5 yrs ago when I was offered a job at a cosmetic counter. I had no idea on how to do makeup at all, so I search YouTube and found you and it change everything thing for me! I found my passion in life, something that I can actually say I’m good at and I owe it to you!! I’m so proud of all your accomplishments and I’m so happy to see you getting back into your groove and I hope I get to watch you create beautiful looks for the next 5 years and beyond! ❤️
Another YouTuber said that it stung too! I can’t remember who it was but they had to take it off too!

SOOOOO HAPPY UR BACK!!! I love this eye look... You are mazing Jaclyn!!
What sponge did you use to do foundation ?
Hi Jaclyn! I love your videos and I’m a big fan. :) I’m graduating this year and was thinking of doing my own makeup but need some ideas of a look that I could do and begin to practice  I would love if you could do a video that had neural eyes but still was glam for grad! ❤️❤️

Nyx wunder pencil would work great for the liner
Cannot wait to re create this eyeshadow look😍😩
Totally not related to the makeup look which is gorgeous btw but do you know the color formula your stylist used on your hair?
ThaTaylaa had the same issue with that concealer.
Jaclyn is back!!! Yes girl, yes! You do you! I'm true to you regardless, and I love watching your videos!
That happened to me too ! With the L’Oréal pro glow concealer ! I thought I was going crazy , but that irritated my under eyes sooo much
Love this look. So glad to see you filming again...missed you girl
Please do an updated Fall Favorites Tag! I’m sure a few items will be the same but maybe you could add a couple more categories. I miss tag videos so much!
so this was the first time ever I think that I've actually followed an eye tutorial like product by product, step by step. And IM OBSESSED! Ive never worn color in public but i need an occasion to wear this!!!
I am truly enjoying you being on youtube again!!!

The maybelline fit me concealer burns my skin and eyes like the pro glow does yours 😭😭I had to stop using it .\nLove the video and this look 👏🏼 your hair is looking long idk if it’s extensions or not but workkkk it 💁🏻
I've definitely had that problem with other L'Oreal concealers, its totally the brand and not just the concealer line.

Cause last time I checked when youtube first started NONE of y'all knew anything about makeup but now all of a sudden everybody a fucking PRO!! Like seriously just stfu with all the hate!

What brush do you use for your bronzer
Please do a top Fall lipstick video focusing on our pale skin girls!!! It's so hard to find good fall colors for fair skin that don't overpower or turn you into a corpse. Please recommend some you love when you're fair 💗
So glad to see ya back in the swing of things, we've missed you. And from one Friends lover to another; you can actually go to Central Perk, they made it a coffee house/ Friends museum!!! 😱😍💜
Loooooooove. Please do an everyday fall eye look!!!😘😘😘😘
My pallet is being shipped im so excited
Since you're on a kat von d kick can you do a tutorial with the saint and sinner palette?!
What are those white objects in the background? Are those rocks, like quartz?
This is not affordable or drugstore. I have yet to find a drugstore makeup tutorial where the beauty guru doesn’t say “Everything is drugstore BUT this item..”. It’s so annoying. This is a drugstore video, get your ass up and go get a drugstore white pencil or drugstore powder. I mean come on now.
You look so pretty in this video and you seem so much more like you compared to the last video you posted! Thanks for coming back for us 💕
I love the eye look.  Glad to see you back and look forward to the next video.
I love you Jaclyn but your pallete is not affordable if you live outside the US. It would have been really helpful if you had actually gone out and got a drugstore setting powder and nude eyeliner to suggest to your viewers instead of saying to use whatever. I watch your videos for suggestions and ideas, not to see you half ass a video. Not impressed :/
Casey Holmes had the same stinging with that concealer
You look so much like Jayden James but ur hotter 😍
My Jaclyn Hill palette is on it's way! I can't wait to get it! I love you 💋
I love the music in the background girl! Its soft and not overbearing and I love how you kept it on during the whole video so it doesnt sound weird turning off and back on again. You're awesome :D
You have the most beautiful skin! Can the people please get an updated video on your skin care routine pleaseeeeee 🙂
Hope to see more videos from You! You started my YouTube addiction and I need more Jaclyn 😂
I absolutely love this look!!! I just received my JH Morphe palette yesterday!! Perfect timing!!!🙌🏼👯
Hi. Any tips on bronzer for very fair skin? I tried using Hoola lite but I all just looks like dirt on my skin 😂
Does anyone know what beauty blender she is using?
You should do a Dos and Donts video, and one half of your face do common mistakes and the other 1/2 do it correctly
I used the Diva shade on my eyes on my last makeup look and I am living for it! I have green eyes so it was perfect! I loved this affordable makeup video!!
You do you Jaclyn, the people will hate no matter what. Xoxo
Girl you are not alone! I always have that issue with my under eye burning when I use any loreal concealer under my eyes!
I am pretty sure NYC (the bronzer) is not being sold in the US anymore. You can find some old displays in random places. If I am wrong, do tell.
even without shipping costs, a $38 palette isn't affordable lol. please.
“moral of the story I’M BACK BITCHES!” 😂
I use this concealer and didn't have a reaction. But I think you have sensitive skin in general. Love you💕💕💕
This literally burns my eye as well & you are the only other person that I have heard say this. It doesn't burn my skin but it burns my eyes. I cannot use it.
You look beautiful .. loved the last lip color ..
More looks with your palette!!!! 😍😭
The Maybelline Fit Me concealer burns my eyes as well so I felt your pain in that clip😂
that brand has stung my skin two I had to wash it off but even afterwards I felt it stinging I was scared it was going to get red or something
So how is $38 for a 35 eye shadow colors palette expensive??? When some other brands only have 12-16 color eyeshadow palettes that's start at $40??????? \nNow everyone wants to be cruelty free but still wears leather, eats meat, and doesn't use natural hair, skin or body products!!\nI'm not saying it's wrong to do to animals...but everyone isn't going to do what some people do...just like everyone isn't vegan...just like some people wear leather...\nPeople are hilarious! Jaclyn love you girl...keep doing you.
Would love to see you use more cruelty free products on your channel.
I get the burning eye with the revlon colour stay!! It's a painnnnn
Two uploads in one week?!?! BLESS!!! Keep it up Jac
How does the lightly dusting powder all over to keep the dewy look work when you caked it all under your eyes? Your undereyes and cheeks looked super powdery after you dusted it back off
Your eyeshadow is really pretty
cant waitttttt for jaclyn to hit 5 million omg
Closing time.... 😊😊😊
Go cruelty free, babe. <3
This also burns my undereye
The maybeline fit me concealer makes my undereyes sting like crazy!!
Are you expecting? 😊
🙌🏼❤️
drugstore concealers burn my eyes too😩😩
SHE'S BACK BITCHES!!! :D
Jaclyn! Thank you so much for being you! You've totally inspired us to create our very own YouTube channel! You're seriously goals.
it did burned me too
Their original fit me concealer burns my under eye too...but I've had that reaction to other concealer too. Wonder what it is!?
i love the honesty and it must be hard living your life with everyone always judging.  Love this look and that you're back with us on youuuutubbbeeeeeee! <3
Girllllllll where'd you get your sweater I can't remember where you said you got it. 😩😩😩 Nordstrom ? Help me lol and your makeup is FLAWLESS as always 😍😍😍😍💕💕💙💙💙💙
I experience that same stinging sensation when I use the Fit Me concealers and thought it was strange too.
Damn girl you gave no fucksssss in this video. Love it! Love you!
I want that palette so bad but Morphe does not ship to Germany 😩😩😩
Thank you for listening to your subscribers, finally! This was great, girl.
Hello Jaclyn I was wondering if you have ever done any videos on micro planning? Do you do it and how do you feel about it.
This video was awesome! The please subscribe in the beginning was hilarious! Mainly cause you never do it. And your dog mom mug is adorable! Hahaha tbis vid made my day. Id compliment your makeup but that's an old compliment lmao. Everyone knows you're the queen
But...why do you overline your lips?\nEspecially so much
It has been a good 2 months I think since I got my JH palette. and i use it almost every single day, its amazing and I love that you show so many different looks we can get with it. \n\nfor people that have it, it is very helpful to get different tutorials on it. \n\nTHANKS!
when are we going to see an updated house tour?
You're amazing babe
Loooovvvvee!!!
lov the eye look
I’m sorry, but what have you done to your face? Leave your face alone!
Great, now I'm hungry AND horny
Crab is cooked in Louisiana crab boil you yanks
I just want to suck the juice off her fingers.
I think I'm in love
This restaurant seems fishy.... Oh wait, wrong restaurant.
I used to crack and empty thousands of crabs in the restaurant I worked at, man was it boring.\nIn fact I got triggered watching this video.
Is this a lesbian couple running the crabby shack lmao
I ate crabs legs on Christmas eve last year, after 2 minutes trying to use the tools provided, I just started breaking them open, that worked.  I love crab, so, so very much.  Thank you for this.  Btw beer and butter? gimme!
This is like watching porn...
And i'm eating oatmeal
They need to farm crustaceans and selectively breed them for larger muscles. Giant crab and lobster meat.
This young lady took eating crab on camera from messy and possibly embarrassing and killed it. Informative and handled herself well while having fun and making a dirty yet tasty job seem almost elegant. She deserves her own show.
They have crabs...\n\nsorry, I'll leave now...
This is making me hungry!
I really thought she was going to talk about the grapefruit technique
Where's Sean Evan's take?
Never ate crab before. Looks like i'm missing out.
Maryland blue crabs are better. They're the best. And crabs aren't crabs if u don't steam'em with OLD BAY.
Good for them on chasing a dream, that food looks great, by the way.
I just noticed how hungry I am
For some reason I was falling in love with this woman during her tutorial... And also I want crab hella badly now.
This made me orgasm out of my penis
This was so inspirational, I love it!
So... I'll see you ladies this week. You're down the block and good gracious.
Maryland blue crabs are the only way to go
From now on we only eat protected foods, like oranges and coconuts and SNOW CRABS.
Anyone else get the 1 minute ad 🙃
I really enjoyed how articulate and descriptive she was!  And she does NOT look 40.  They say black don't crack, but I say, black cracks crabs!!!!  Yum!
Amazing restaurant I would love to go to since I was grew up with crabs...... that didn't come out right
I think I fell in love
Holy mother fuck I want all of that crab all up in and around me right now.
Step 1: Don't, it's fucking disgusting.
This would be such a disturbing video to watch if you were a crab
Tracy King Crab shack in Juneau Alaska is way better lol
...and they give the best head.
I learned that method on my own. I'm not trying sound cocky... It's the best method. Every crab lover should know it, I encourage everyone to learn it because it's as easy to learn as riding a bike. Sean Evans, you do need to bring Gordon Ramsay on to Hot Ones and also see if he knows how to open up crabs legs properly with this method haha.
Please give me you're crabs. I need them in me.
Next time go to the Krusty Krab
Way to rehash an older video!
Are you feeling it now Mr Krabs?
i have to go this weekend idc
the perfect woman does exist.... X2
As a born and raised marylander living in NYC,  I would love to put this to the test
i desperately need to go here when i'm back in nyc, oh my god it looks so good!!! these ladies are killing it!!!!!
I usually just crack the claw with my molar teeth, it is risky though since it can stab you, so don't just chomp on it and take time breaking the shell.
So hungry. Must have. Threw in mac and cheese at the end. I died.
step 1. you don't eat crab
Which one is better?\n\nLobsters or crabs?
First we feast production quality is fucking incredible.
She really enjoys her crab meat, haha. I can't say I blame her!
When admiration turns into jealously, when jealously turns into anger, when anger turns into hangry, hit the like button.
Please get Ice Poseidon on hot ones! !
Unfortunately I can't eat any seafood as I'm allergic to them. This video made me hungry though
I knew I would be hungry AGAIN if I watch this video, and here I am hungry at my room in the middle of the night -_-
where the rest of the brab ?
I'm 25 years old and never had crab what am I doing with my life?
A sprinkle of old bay? No, a true east sider knows that you heavy hand that shit on there, theres no other way to eat crabs.
This food looks delicious, and they seem really nice and down to earth!
King crab is literally the most miserable food in the world to eat. It's like, okay, I worked 40 hours this week to buy this shit. Now that it's served, let me work another 15 minutes per piece to even eat a little.
I found this extraordinarily easy to masturbate to.
Ain't nobody got time to peel away outer shell from crabs. Eat it whole.
And heres this giant enemy crab
This is how amateurs eat crab.
Eat like a savage *period*
Hell yeah, this as a nice change from the pizza videos. Not that I don't like everything this channel produces, a change is just nice. And I like these women far more than the hipster al pastor fella.
Juicy crawfish in vegas is the best seafood sauce is spicy as hell too
I don't know why, but it's been incredibly hard to find crab in Sydney for about the last year...
Make your own version of crabby patty..make it into a burger...lol
Go down on a crack whore. Eat crabs like a pro
Damn, if I ever come to America I _need_ to try the crabs there. Y'all have amazing crab dishes. I'm borderline aroused just from watching this video.
This random channel was in my inbox
Man I wish there was a good seafood place near where I live/
As soon as I saw niggers, I stopped the video.. Shouldn't they be doing fried chicken or watermelon?
Not bonkers for crab [nor the task opening that shit with all that liquid butter....no thx!] however, ...I am impressed by these two woman for following their dreams! \n\nWelcome to Pat & Patty's Crabby Shack! Crackin' & Suckin'
Didn’t zagat do this a year ago?... with the same people too.
God that looks too good! I need this near me
They're 40?! God they're gorgeous!
fuck college imma flip dope
yes
My favorite
Fuck I'm hungry! That looked delicious!!!
Awesome!!
That looks so bombs
Fantastic
Lobster puts crab to shame
Awesome
New fetish
Jamis Winston approved
Her oily hands make me uncomfortable
Crabs cooked in beer? I'm drooling! 😚
Nice ladies.
🤤🤤🤤🤤
Featuring Jameis Winston
Ahhhh love it!!!
daaamn
American food is shit
such nice ladies and delicious looking crabs
Did we really need instruction on how to crack open a crab and suck near our and dig it our with a butter knife? Lol no. Glad to watch but all foodys k ow how to not waste a drop. Lol
No disrespect to old bay but boiling crabs in chackbay and zatarains crab boil is the best. Throw in a half or whole bottle of crystal and boy do you have some tasty crabs.
You should get Blink-182 on Hot Ones. Even though it'll be Matt instead of Tom, but it'd still be cool to see Mark.

Some people out here sound so stupid at times I’m from California and if I can understand everything he’s saying maybe some of U people are just listening to slow after all he didn’t even use any slang so maybe you’re just the stupid one if you need to put someone down to make you feel better about yourself just think about it!!

Hey guys! I hope you enjoyed today's video! I'm so excited to finally start this years Halloween series it's gonna be a blast! Ps. I realise I said Mickey Mouse instead of Minnie Mouse, not sure why I did, I know the costume was Minnie's, i'm just silly haha!
Somehow you ended up looking good in all of these. #shook
November is normally the month when I grow out of clothes and i normally want to wear the costume I wore the year before for Halloween 👻 sooo that sucks
That's Minnie Mouse not Mickey Mouse 😂😂😂
She obviously likes very short costumes that are very tight.
You could make the Mickey Mouse ears stiffer by watering down some clear drying liquid glue and painting it on to them. The glue should stiffen the fabrich without making it look cheap.
Great video! Check to win 1 of 1000 halloween wigs here: http://bit.ly/spintowinwigs
you are meant to put them over your shoes
I'M SO READY FOR THE HALLOWEEN VIDEOS🤗❤. also side note: did anyone get kinda triggered when she kept valling Minnie mouse Mikey mouse?
Half of them r play suits
that costume is alice angel from bendy and the ink machine
That is VERY DEFINITELY minnie mouse.....\n\nLol whatever
Why do the costumes come with things ??
The wings were upside down
Why are you so cute?! The minnie mouse were realy nice on you.
You inspired me o b Mario for Halloween....thanks
Its Minnie not Mickey.
Its MINNIE mouse
£10 = $20
It not mikey mouse it minie mouse
I love your accent
Love your Chanel
anyone else quietly screaming Minnie untill she finally says Minnie...
Thongs, why, just why?
you put the wings on upside down lol..
It's not marrio it's mario
Daaayyyym girl !! God bless u 💝 u look good in everything 💋
I literally thought she was Safiyya from Buzzfeed( who now has her own channel)
Love the makeup look💟
It's kind of sad that your merch looks like a Sara M Lyons whatever forever rip off. I'm not surprised because a ton of people have ripped her off with that design, but I'm disappointed to see you added to that list. 😢
THONGS!!!!!!! :P\nlol there so you don't have underwhere lines
Halloween is supposed to be scary?
MINNE MOUSE
Y r there so many thongs
Minnie Mouse
I don't understand. When did Halloween become a second carneval/ sexy flirt party? The costumes are meant to be scary and creepy! Not cute or sexy! Wtf??
It's not a wonder woman costume, it's super girl! :)
Roxxsaurus u cold put a red tutu on the superwoman costume
The boy that I love is called ibai if you speak spanish you'll understand it😍
Hi I just saw your channel and I loved it
Hey people, would you mind checking out @ThinkingOfThing on Twitter? My goal is just to make this dreary world a bit more positive :))\nThanks so much xx
When she said Mickey Mouse when it’s supposed to be Minnie 😰😨😱
Hi guys, are there any small you-tubers out there that would like to support each other? I do beauty related videos with reviews and unboxings ♥ Thank you
It might come with thongs because the costume might be see through
It’s Minnie not Mickey
I’m pretty sure the wings were upside down 😕
who else got a little irritated when she would say Mickie instead of mini lol but ily
All I could think about is the sexy pumpkin from himym 😂
I'm going to be a slut for Halloween. My favorite holiday.
Is it just me that automatically thought of slutty pumpkin from HIMYM when she was showing the pumpkin
It's Minnie not Mickey
she put the Tinkerbell wings on upside down
hi, its my first time here and im already in .... LOOOOOVVVVEEE!!!!!!!!!!
older grace what's her name u know the little girl who was on Ellen and Sam and cat and sings with her cousin who doesn't actually do anything
I have the Luigi one 😂
When you said adult costumes they meant role play costumes, adult adult costume 👭👫 🍆
WHEN SHE SAID ARIANA I WAS LIKE OMGGGGGGGGGGGG
I felt so disrespected as she kept saying MICKEY MOUSE for a Minnie mouse costume lol
Who remembers the pumpkin costume from that one How I met your mother episode!!
When You Go to the link to the skeleton dress, it showes a skeleton suit or somthing, is it the dress or What?
note i love   it mikkwily  pour   :o)

Love this video! I really consider to be a pumpkin for Halloween 😄 haha

Woooooo halloween
Why..
*is this how to bold things*
I LOVE INGRID don't get me wrong but maybe she could recommend us products that are actually affordable I think that would be great ingrid 😊
Can you do an updated, unsponsored, how you keep your skin clear/how you went from having cystic acne to relatively nothing on your face? This would be so helpful for me. We used to have the exact same skin and now yours is drastically different and mine hasn't changed so I would love to know!
Your hair is so beautiful!
I love face masks! ❤❤ loving your frequent uploading. Thank you. ☺
I don't remember your brows being this bold, I love them 😍
It’s official our miss glamorize is baaaaack ! I love that kind of videos that’s remind me why I did subscribe to your channel years ago since the blue room :p
You inspired me to make my own channel! Been watching you for years :D
When is the podcast coming back? I really miss it!! 😔
WHY ARE U LOSING SUBS?!
Here's another one  https://www.ebay.com/i/371642174655
A lot of clarifying/acne treatment masks try out my skin too much and end up clogging my pores. The sulfur mask sounds promising! Definitely need to check it out.
I love you and I feel like we're friends so I want to say I'm not feeling your new eyebrow pencil! I think your older routine looks more natural. Just a friend to a friend suggesting you switch back 😘
I love how strong your brows are looking 🙌🏼
These all have highly irritating and harmful ingredients including fragrance that can actually damage skin.  You should consult a dermatologist Ingrid.
lol I can't pronounce masks either... the s's...
I've started keeping face masks in my carry on luggage so I can always use one at my travel destination! It's the best
I am a Face Mask lover too!! lol thank you for this video Ingrid!!! Also, can you please do an Updated apartment or house tour?? Miss your apartment tours so much, only like yours lol ❤️❤️😊😊
I think people just gotta accept that it will be difficult to see a lot of affordable masks on Ingrid's channel. I mean, look at her skin, it's freaking glowing. She doesn't have acnes, her face glowing without looking oily. That means all those expensive masks worked and they are worth the money. Just freaking buy one high end mask and try to see if it works because it already worked for Ingrid. And if it worked for her, she would want to share to us so we can experience good things like her. Stop with the complaints about her always recommend expensive stuffs and be grateful
i all time like your Youtube =))
my favorite face mask is catastrophe cosmetic from lush, it's sooooo nice!
Ingrid. Srsly. Words like masks, tasks, and asks make me rage. I don't get everyone's hatred of moist, but plurals of words ending in -ask send me straight to the looney bin.
The thumbnail looks like she is ready to cry
My fave is origins out of trouble mask! Feels very purifying but gentle as it doesnt dry so i tend to keep it on when im having breakfast
Thank you!! Such a great video with such helpful content! I can't wait to try the Sunday Riley one!
Not sure what in particular is different, but you look like you just had an amazing spa retreat. So refreshed!
Ingrid, what camera and lens do you use? btw, I also love the Fresh Umbrian Clay mask
My favourite is the HM volcano mask :D I'ts so super good? :O
You have been recamending a lot of product and it would be great to see a skin care routine so we see the products in order
Loving the videos you've been doing lately :D x
Anyone have a recommendation for a mask that hydrates and reduces redness??
I definitely think you should try a pixie cut Ingrid, it would really suit you!
Help  guys. I need a mask that will help me to mattify my face. I have really glowy  skin but i hate it. It looks oily even after i clean it. My forehead and t zone is really shiny all the time and sometimes my forehead is really dry but its still shining. Help? Really need a mattifying mask. 😥😥😥😥😥😥
I just want fashion ... that's all I care about
I am so excited to try some of these! Can you please make a video about the different skincare ingredients? Definitely would like to learn more about what you know about them! 😊
Ingrid, I totally have the same problem with plural words that end in -sk. Like tasks, desks etc. lol !!! I always ask others if they think it's weird or funny sounding. Most people say they don't hear anything weird, wrong or funny about it... just me lol.
Your reviews are always the best and I love that you're uploading so frequently!
I'm trying to reach 30 subs can y'all please help by subscribing?
My FAVOURITE mask is Caudalie Instant Detox Mask. It's 👌 and my holy grail! Definitely reccomend :) Makes my skin so soft and super calms down my skin when I feel a breakout coming on.
Okay so no lie I was thinking yesterday I wonder if any youtubers have videos talking about good face masks and today I SEE THIS. YOU ANSWERED MY CALL! My face has been a mess I needed this thank you love!💛
Have you tried the Moonfruit sleeping mask by Herbivore? It's incredible!!
I had to do a book report presentation on Stravaganza: City of Mask**s** in elementary school and I had the hardest time.
The watermelon mask is one of my absolute favorite skincare products ever. It’s completely balanced out the skin on my face!!
Ugh I wish I had the money to buy at least one of these products
This is really helpful. My skin is bad and I have some new recommendations.
Perfect timing! I was about to google some face masks. Haha
Check out the L'Oreal clay mask range!  They are SO good!
I hope you could have a vacation in the Philippines! We have a lot of face masks here too! ❤\n\nXoxo,\n\nIya
Thanks Ingrid! It's so cool to see new face mask types I've never heard of before - thy Korean one sounds fab!! Can't wait to get my hands on that watermelon one toooo! 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽💕💕💕
great even i love masks too
I was just about to stock up on sheet masks!! This came just in time! btw the sk2 facial treatment mask is REALLY good
I love the peel off version of the Egg Cream mask. Super nice to take it off and feel refreshed:)
How often do you do face masks
Yes fill this channel up with videos👏🏼😍
So happy that you enjoyed korean skincare!!! 😍😍
I love how you're getting into Korean skincare! It's amazing!
I love the Aveda Outer Peace cooling masque and The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Clay Mask. The Aveda one is a slightly runny clay mask that is sage green in color. It smells really herbal and woody, reminds me of sawdust. It really helps breakouts and redness. The Body Shop mask is on the thicker side and is mint green in color. It smells like tea tree oil and is very cooling on the skin. It really helps breakouts.
Humm , the liquid one looks interesting ! But i 'm not into sheet mask  :( BISES !
You should check out masks from Ko Skin Box! They have great high quality masks that you'd love!
always enjoy your videos :). tks Ingrid. best to you.
Great video on masks! The DKM Skincare Charcoal Creme Masque is amazing with clean ingredients! Check it out in our channel and on FB and Instagram!
Anyone have mask recommendations for combination/dry skin?
The Whamisa by Glow Recipe Green Tea Clay Mask is not technically a drugstore item. It's a collaboration between Glow Recipe, an online K-beauty retailer and Whamisa, a higher-end Korean brand. They just introduced their line to Target though, which is pretty cool! It is on the more affordable side which is nice but keep in mind you don't get that much product. Anyways, now I NEED to get my hands on that mask! Hopefully it comes to my Target sooooon!!!
I live for her beauty and skin-care videos omg I’m so here for this
i hope the podcast comes back soon, i miss it!
Go away libtard
❤️ Face masks, glad you reviewed what you got and used, it's helpful to know what to try and what brand to order online 🤔and btw I'm loving your no makeup look in this video, which focusing on blush on your cheeks & brows.. looks fresh..
Do you do full skin care routines both morning and night?
My favorite masks:\n#1 Kiehl's Rare Earth Pore Cleansing Mask (my holy grail)\n#2 Earth Theraputics Soothing Aloe Vera Sheet Mask (amazing for winter time)\n#3 Yes to Cucumbers Calming Mask (great for sensitive skin)\n\nAnd if you have blackheads and haven't used #1, girlll you're totally missing out.
Love that shirt you're wearing ❤️ where's it from?!
i am so checking these masks out! 💕👌🏻
Ingrid you are making me want to work so hard on my YouTube channel!!! Xx
I need to know how she tires so many different skin care items and doesn’t break out
Your hair looks amazing in this, you look so fresh
Alguém do Brasil?
watching this on my bday ♡♥
you are stunning!!!
My favs are homemade masks . You are really pretty ...
love!
I❤️face masks also!
Hola guapuritas :v
Yay a skincare vid to watch while im locked outside my hous
Ingrid lowkey reminds me of Malia from teen wolf
Love this video Ingrid!
😍 ingrid
Wow Ingrid you look glowing !
한국제품이라는데 한국에서 못 사는 아이러니..
Never really comment ever, but i always like Ingrid's personality and want to show some support. I get why some people complain that Ingrid uses and recommends expensive products while other youtubers can use and rave about way more expensive products. It is because Ingrid's personality is humble, honest, and nice and she seems wiser than her peer; and that doesnt really fit into the category of luxury or consumerism. Like for example, some other youtubers talk about crazy expensive stuff but it fits them and their branding. However i dont think it is Ingrid's problem, it is people's expectation and their idea of Ingrid that make it hard for them to except that Ingrid has grown up and earned her the life she has now. and there is nothing wrong with that. \n\nYou may say it is also because her audience market doesnt need or want to know about expensive products. But i think those audience also follows other youtubers who have even more luxurious life styles. It is all about their expectations. \n\nBut Ingrid, if you are interested in keeping and growing your audience, you can focus more on your branding strategy now. Just saying. \n\nI get you and i always like you. Good day!
You should try Susan Kaufman skincare, it's all natural, suuuper luxurious, and most importantly effective! I'm in love with their enzyme peel mask, but it's more on the tingling side of the spectrum, but I can't wait to try more from the range when I run out of stuff I'm using!
Love u Ingrid. You have such Amazing Skin and hair!
Firstly I want to thank you a million times. You are the reason I finally have the skin that I have always prayed for, smooth and pimple free. Every products that you recommend worked for me as well, that's why I am always excited to see your skin routine, monthly favs, and makeup routine. Your review helped me to choose right skin care products. Thank you and I love you
Can someone tell me who Estee is? I want to look up her instagram so I can get more reviews on the mask.
Are you still loving the eve lom and omorivizca masks?
I'm confused. The brands did NOT ask you to include the links, but you *may* make a commission off of them? \n\nI'm okay with sponsored stuff but I feel like you should be honest about which of these things you are making commission off of, and which you just happened to find and love. You can still truly love something that's sponsoring you, but you should be honest about which products those are.
I love masks too, so I'd like to know how often you use them? A different mask each night? Thanks!!
I can’t believe I’ve been following you for 7 years ever since you would film videos sitting in front of your bed. Time goes by so fast
Paused video. Can't stop trying to say masks. It's impossible. Why?! What is happening?!
Ingrid, is your top Aritzia?
You forgot the cat woman mask, if you wore that lol I would put on a batman mask with the jumpsuit, black underwear and cape.. then you can whip and scratch me..
I got a Soko to Tokyo Sephora favorites box and it came w the egg mask and I’m so excited to use it ...and I’m soooo tempted to buy the watermelon mask 🙆🏻
Have you tried the new Lush masks? They are wonderful!

The pain & fear in her mom's eyes hurt my heart.
It hurt my heart when I saw Nabeela's mother be so reassuring and then quietly look off into the distance with all her worry written on her face.
The sadness in the mother's eyes is heartbreaking
Nabeelah's parents though.... You can see it on the moms face. :(
5:48 is NOT an EpiPen! EpiPen is the market name—NOT a generic injector name—for an EPINEPHRINE auto-injector. She is taking INSULIN, likely either Lantus or Humalog. This girl needs to be told what medication she's taking and via what means using what tools. If she were in a diabetic near-coma and she or somebody else said I need an EpiPen it could kill her! For fuck sake!
I'm not a diabetic, nor have an eating disorder, but found this video very interesting. I do hope that further research is done for this disease, and that it gets added to the medical field as a recognized disorder.
I didn’t even know this existed
It's crazy that 60% of women with type 1 diabetes struggle with this and I'm just now hearing and learning about it, I hope awareness  for this grows.
Wow. I thought I was the only one who has gone through this. Crazy. I went almost two 2 years taking my insulin 10 times total. (Now I do it 3 times a day!!!) I went from 103 pounds to 160 in less than two weeks after taking my insulin again and now I weigh 135..finally back to my normal weigh. I definitely wish I didn't do what I did but in the moment I couldn't stop. My eyesight is worse but I don't have any other problems as a result of this disease.
BBC covers the most random things you've never heard of, it's great, super educational.
wow, I had never heard of this
Thank you for sharing. I didn't but even know this exsisted until now. So sad it's not talked about.
Diabulimia isn't a diagnosis. It's just an added complication to current EDs
I'm 20 and was diagnosed with diabetes and kidney disease at 8 when I was younger around 13/14 I used to do this to myself not understanding I was really hurting myself. I'm so glad there is a rise in awareness about this issue cause it's real.
It took me embarrassingly long to figure out why it's called diabulimia
this video will probably give people ideas.
My heart goes out to them!! Keep fighting for your beautiful, young lives ladies!! ❤❤
This is so sad 🙁☹
Wow thank you so much for raising awareness about this, I'm definitely going to talk about this with my community.
Wow I had not heard of this until now. Thank you.
Nabeelah is the cutest, sweetest young lady. God bless her and her family they are so adorable together. <3
Nabeelah's parents are so loving and understanding. I hope they've been able to help her and keep her down a more happy and healthy path.
What a scary disorder. I never heard of this.
I'm just wondering why insulin pumps aren't an option for these girls. That might help with some of the injection reluctance. Takes some of the decision making away.
I never knew about this, thanks for raising awareness of this.
I had never heard of diabulimia until today seeing this video. YouTube leads me to the most random topics and videos huh. But so glad this is being talked about now. And wishing all those people and families the best, and anyone out there suffering. Hope you find healing, happiness and health soon loves. Xo
I wonder if insulin pumps rather than injections would help at all.  Some pumps now connect right to a cell phone as well.  Healthcare providers can easily check if patients are bolusing for meals and it includes low levels of insulin at all times which could help people recover.
so sad. she said her parents didnt understand.. but they clearly did. all it takes is talking to know some1 understands what ur going through.. so eye opening. talk to ur kids people. force them to talk... and understand. i cried.
Brought to tears about this. I have friends who have Diabetes type 1. It's amazing that I am able to know and learn about this. Thank you for making so many people aware of this!
The statistic of 60% of women with type 1 fiabetes will suffer from this is absolutely terrifying cause i met an amazing little girl while i was on work experience at a school. She's 6 and is top of the class but she could end up with this horrible mental disorder wihin the next ten years and she doesn't deserve that. No one does.
I'm pretty sure this eating disorder has been around for _at least_ a couple decades..
They should install an insulin pump so that she cannot control her dosage
Nabeelah's family is so lovely ❤️
good luck.know how it is to have somekind of illness.hope you can eat pretty normaly :) see u!
I stopped eating last year BUT I'm eating again but a while ago my friend was like u have anorexia because I'm so obsessed with my weight and if I look in the mirror and see if I but in weight I'll have to exercise what does this meann
never heard of this until now. i'm shocked.
can i just say i love how the woman looked back to make sure the cameraman was there
I'm blown away by this video. \n\nMy best friend has Type 1 diabetes and I always tried to support her as she was struggling with the disease throughout her teenage years. We were like sisters, we would even spend Christmas Day together. After years of friendship, about age 16, she purposefully began to let her health deteriorate. Her blood sugar levels were through the roof, at risk of gangrene and so was admitted to hospital every few months and I always came with her. During these stays the doctors pleaded with her to monitor her BSL, they even gave her a diary to keep track of every meal and her insulin doses. She refused to write in it, she refused to take insulin, she snuck in snacks without telling anyone, without taking any insulin. I couldn't understand. Why was my friend doing this, why was she killing herself right in front of me, why wouldn't she let me help? I offered to write in her insulin diary for her, I thought she didn't want to deal with the disease as she was always telling me how much she hated that she was diabetic. Now, looking back, I can finally understand. It was Diabulimia. She told me she hated that the insulin made her have lumps on her belly and bum and thighs. She told me it made her look fat. I told her it didn't. But I didn't understand that she was crying out for help because of a disease that no one knew she had. I told her I couldn't stand to watch her harm herself anymore and selfishly cut off contact. \n\nI think I need to ring her tomorrow, I hope she'll forgive me.
I don't know much about insulin. How come the girls seem to be even more worried about taking their insulin than eating? Can it cause weight gain moreso?
diabetes is actually a scary disease :S oh god...
I've actually struggled with similar, I have Addison's and take steroids to survive. Steroids cause weight gain. It's not hard to cut down steroid amounts to the point where it barely keeps you alive, and yet you actually lose weight. I did this for a few years, until I lost so much weight I actually looked awful, felt awful, and family noticed. Even after stopping, it's a hard thing not to consider, especially when the scale jumps up a little, or I feel bloated.
Could anyone explain to me why it doesn't work with type 2?
You can have Type 1 diabetes and not take insulin. Instead you can take metformin.
Thank you! Both frightening and inspirational!
I hate how I feel without my insulin, I can't imagine how they feel.
Wow, new types of eating disorders, this is really sad.
As a previous sufferer of this awful condition this was a hard watch. I suffer from retinopathy now because of how my lifestyle was and there was little to no help available I was just told to inject my insulin. thankfully I have come through now and my life has completely changed for the better. Thank you for making this programme.
Can you imagine if someone had this here in America? Our health care system is so shitty, no one would care. This girl has a nurse attached to her at the hip, presumably paid for by he government.
I just started crying for some reason when it was told what type 1 diabetics have to do in daily basis. Probably the words in order to live was the reason why I started crying...Type 1 diabetes isn't end of the world, not by any means, if you just take good care of yourself. But what many people don't realise is that how much it can affect person's life, how complex disease it is and how stressfull it can sometimes be... How much one have to sruggle with it sometimes just to live. And I was so happy when FINALLY the difference between the types was told CLEARLY.
Thank you so much
In my country they would all be dead.
I hope these women find recovery and joy.
Glad to see awareness about this. I've been in treatment with a couple of girls that did this.
what wonderful indian parents. I wish all parents could be that fantastic. ♡♡
I'm a diabetic and I know a few girls who actually did this to lose weight
I can relate to this so much. I was recently diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic myself and I had become so skinny leading up to my diagnosis. I am so much healthier now and feel great now that I have treatment, but sometimes I think about not taking my insulin for a few days or a week just to shed some extra fat, but I know how damaging it is. I'm so glad they made this cause it's such a rare but serious condition.
my country (canada), does not recognize diabetes type 1 as a chronic illness/disability. Apparently it doesn't 'interfere' enough
I suffered from eating disorders for four years until I developed type 1. Just before I was diagnosed, I had this desperate urge to recover, and for a while I felt so good about how I was doing. However, the discomfort and fear spiraled out of control after diagnosis solely because of the way people reacted. I had lost so much weight so quickly before being diagnosed that as soon as I got home, people started warning me that I would gain weight and blow up like a balloon if I wasn't careful. Some were well-meaning, and others were just rude, but I was constantly barricaded with I'll give you a small piece. You're going to make your diabetes get worse or should you be eating that? Is that okay? Can you have that? There's this constant feeling that everyone thinks I have type 1 because I was overweight, lazy, and constantly overeating. Someone even asked me when I was diagnosed if I had a binging problem. \nOnce I was listening to a speaker who was tossing out pieces of candy to whoever answered a question, and in front of everyone she looked at me and said, i know I can't give you any, but good answer. I was humiliated.\nCompared to the shame, vulnerability, and public humiliation of an eating disorder and having type 1 (even though no one gives themselves type 1, and they can eat just like normal people), the pain of being diagnosed with an incurable disorder was quite literally nothing. I'm still scared to take enough insulin because I associate it with weight gain and the negative stereotypes that people ignorantly transfer from type two. It's wrong, but I'm ashamed of the word diabetes. My AIC has been over nine for most of the past five years, and even my doctor told me I was unmotivated to take care of myself. I'm at a loss, honestly, and in the most brutal form of honestly I think I'll die pretty young.
I remember walking out of the doctors office after being diagnosed and immediately googling does insulin cause weight gain.... hits home
Thanks for sharing this video. I've never heard of this I hope everyone gets the help they need. Probably a stupid question but why does insulin make you gain weight, I know someone with type one diabetes and she is not like over weight and she isn't under weight I just confused
Intersting! I have diabitis type 2 and overdose with metformin when scared of gaining weight
These poor girls. I pray they are able to get better.
I'm glad that I was able to learn about this. I had wondered about those with diabetes and eating disorders simultaneously.
the ED inpatient clinic I went to in my hometown specialized in diabulimia, and we had people from all around the country coming to get care because it was one of like five in the entire US. It's crazy that there's such a lack of treatment options
I can't even imagine what these women struggle with on a daily basis.\n\nIf I'd been diabetic with the option of reducing insulin for weight loss during the midst of my darkest bulimia days, you bet your ass I would have done so. It sounds tempting even now, a year into recovery. It was torture to me when I was forbidden to exercise and I am an avoid-physical-movement-at-all-costs-because-I-don't-like-the-way-my-fat-jiggles-when-I-move, self-induced vomit, purging sub-type (sorry for the graphic imagery; that's just the way it was and, thankfully, things are much better now). \n\nAnyhow, that required limitation of movement in addition to the compulsory guzzling of Ensures/inhaling of behemoth portions of food was hard enough. Add daily dosages of a weight-friendly drug into the mix and I would have run screaming for the hills, but you ladies... If there is even a smidgen of a chance that you glance at the comments, I want you to know that your struggles are heard and they are REAL. You have been given a shitty situation paired with another shitty situation and it is so far from fair, but you CAN and you WILL beat this. \n\nMuch love,\n\nA Fellow ED-Sufferer and Survivor
Thank you BBC Three for this video, I had never heard about this before. Great work you're doing, raising awareness.
Oh this is heartbreaking. Best wishes to all the girls and their families.
My eating disorder started after my divorce.....actually since I was in asbusive relationship and its been seven years i still have  the condition
Thank you so much for shedding light on such a dark topic! I have bulimia and my friend has diabulimia and even though there are overlaps, it is so different and there is much to learn. So many people hardly understand how diabetes works, much less diabulimia. I understand now how excruciating and devastating this mental disorder. And another thank you for interviewing a POC, who tend to get overlooked in eating disorder documentaries and films. Well done, BBC. Thank you for this raw insight.
to any girl with an eating disorder...your life is worth more than that...life is there to enjoy, not struggle over vain issues...your body isn't everything...be HAPPY
This is scary as all heck
I have diabetes and iam a girl im 17 but omg I can relate with this ohh god I though I was alone
I'm so happy this is being brought attention to. I have diabulimia.  I'm recovering slowly. I was down to 99lbs at 5'6. I've put all my weight back on, but a third of the weight is Edema, or swelling / water retention because I'm in kidney failure.  I'm stage 3 did because if skipping out on my insulin for ten years. My vision has been effected emensly . I have diabetic neuropothy.  I've miscarried all my pregnancies, because of high glucose levels. This condition has ruined my life. This disease has destroyed me.
I come from a medical family so I know a lot about medicine, the latest treatments, etc. but I have to say, I never heard of this kind of eating disorder. It's definitely important for the world to gain more awareness of this type of conditions, because I'm sure many medical professionals wouldn't be able to diagnose it at first, simply because they wouldn't know what to look for.
Thank you SO much for making this documentary, its a very important thing to bring awareness to, and the producers and the brave women who shared their story in this could easily be saving future sufferers lives!!
amazing that they included a girl from a different culture ( thats known for not recognizing or shaming disorders) and that that girl isnt already stick-thin. visibility done well.
I've always seen diabetes as a whole life kind of disease that also needs a whole life kind of treatment. Like many chronic illnesses. If you have alcoholism and diabetes you have to understand that the problem is not diabetes just because the person isn't taking his/hers insulin. It not the alcohol. ITS THE REASON THAT MAKES YOU DRINK THAT IS THE PROBLEM. Alcohol is just an affect of something not working in that persons life. Remove/fix/manage that reson for alcohol and the reason to take insulin will increase. And that is applicable onto all chronicle diseases. There's no ONE FIX for it. Fixing one thing wont change everything. But treating it as a whole will. Its a matter of life and life quality. Increase that and the medication will follow suit. I'm sad to see that the health care system in the UK is so divorced when it comes to treating chronicle illness. It cant be just a problem for diabulimia. Its probably a symptom noticeable all over the health care system of the UK.
It's so fucked up what are we willing to do under the pressure to fit into society norms. I know EDs have deeper meaning but it eventually all goes down to the thought that being skinny is something positive, a way to reach perfection and order in our lives. I can never understand the state of mind I was in for those 2 years and now, 6 years later, I find it impossible to have that kind of determination to put my own health and life at risk like that. It feels like I was a different person.
think I have type 2 not sure but been having all the symptom's, and I eat stupid amounts of sugar filled drinks&foods been nearly blacking out recently & my eye sight is getting worse ect need to get my skinny are to the doctors
being a teenage girl with diabetes these statistics really worry me... I imagine getting diagnosed later in life would mean the risk of diabulimia is higher, being diagnosed when I was super young is really helpful to me because I don't know any different, I can't imagine the idea of not having diabetes then having your freedom taken away from you, that will effect anyone.
It makes me feel lucky to not have diabetes alongside my anorexia. I understand that the illness itself is different, but I feel grateful to be more understood than those with diabulimia
Aw the Dad really wants to help but doesn't know what to do :( x
Nabeelah's mum. Her eyes. The pain in her eyes. 💔😢
I didnt even know this existed... Holy shit. Thank you for this video, really helps us become more educated about eating disorders.
This is crazy. I have grown up around Type 1 diabetes as both my mum and one of my friends in school have it. I also had a friend during uni who had it, she used to occasionally cut down on insulin to eat more but I never saw this as an actual disorder. So interesting, great thing to be raising awareness for.
I knew about this... Glad to see it's being brought to attention. Painfully dangerous.
Awe..Gemma is absolutely gorgeous. .really hope all these people realize they're worth more and deserve to be healthy and take care of themselves
As a type 1 diabetic on an insulin pump, I would never wish this disease on anyone and the struggle we go through daily for the rest of our lives in purely exhausting trying to do what our body should be doing for itself. I've known about Diabulimia for such a long time, I've known friends of mine who have done this. I'm glad to see we're finally starting to have discussions about it and truly hope that this continues and an official diagnosis can be made so that we can start helping those who struggle with this. To my fellow diabetic warriors - keep up the good fight and hopefully some day we will have a cure for this disease! ❤️
That girl with white hair looked like Riley Blue in Sense8.
holy shit
Great awareness raising
wow poor Eden :(
my name's gemma
Better than jamaica
why do narrators in documentary always have British accents 😂?
It's like observing mentally ill people skipping their medication 'in order to feel alive' or whatever and calling it a mental illness of its own. My, my, Big Pharma and health industry in general must be so desperate. This is capitalism in its finest.
It's incredible what the mind can do. I strongly believe that all of the fisical and psychological illnesses that people has are created by they mind. How much do you have to hate your soul to treat your being like crap. Smoking, developing eating disorders, even growing cancer it's part of how we love or not love ourselves. Life is simpler than this... If people could see and really see clearly the whole picture this things wouldn't happen.
The dad is precious 😭 her parents are doing their best to understand and help !
This is scary and disgusting I hope these people get well soon. This whole thing seems painful my heart rally goes out to these people. :(
Sounds like people with a death wish. I can't believe the harm people do to themselves these days. What's hurting them so much that they wants to go near death ?
I cannot fucking wait to get back into Ghost War! You guys killed it with this, I mean that in a good way just to be clear.
Now THIS is up our alley 😃 Can't wait! #StayTactical
So excited for pvp
all I want is more ac origins vids
This is gonna be sweet, can't wait for Oct 10th! :D
We have a release date! Can't wait to play this, awesome job ubisoft. I knew it was worth the wait!
How to tie multiplayer into the main story: 4 Ghosts went Rouge with stolen CIA files the other 4 ghosts tracked them down to a place (name of map here).
Fist your so good at ghost recon wildlands
I just love the customizations that you can put on your own unit.
While I liked the beta I do hope is more modes to keep us playing a bigger map with say a 30min time limit most kills wins.
I had so much damn fun winning and losing playing this pvp I can’t wait
I hope this is not regionally blocked again.
If this is 4/4, where's 3/4?!!!
Sounds awesome can't wait to play...however I believe marking is way to easy it takes away the difficulty it also takes away the chance of players to try and lose the enemy when they are found PLS CONSIDER THIS
That assassin mask better be available in single player and co-op...
Did they add flash lights yet?
Does anyone know if the time Standalone comes out the same day as the update?
Not a lot of folks played the beta (Xbox1) they missed out. Let's hope we get a big turnout and Ubisoft stays with dedicated servers. This game will not be a sleeper.
Remove Cote to kick on rainbow six
Is this worth the 7 month WAIT? I'm very Salty about this, they are doing a peer to peer like For Honor. What a Joke UBISOFT! Plus there Isn't a Penalty for the RAGE quitters, which hangs you up in a middle of a match at-least 10 minutes for a replacement for the other team. The Beta was Sweet AZZ besides these 2 Major Issues. I'm not saying we are the best Squad out there, Team Infidels. But spending 70% of the gameplay time waiting on Q for replacements of the opposite Team, sucks Ballz Ubisoft. When released we will Share some Videos called WILDLANDS RAGE.
Rainbow Six Siege in 3RD PERSON!
They look a bit...Soft. Like when a Japanese game has female soldiers and they all look like models.
I requested the day off from work for this day under the category Personal Time Off. 😂🎮
very good game would be good each one by itself, and conquest of the same as the previous ghost recon and consider the preparation time add a little more...
Assasin and Pointman.. i'm a fcking ninja
Quit asking for 6v6, 10v10, 16v16, or Battle Royale. If you want that, go play PUBG or Fortnite (Free to download btw). Ghost War 4v4 brings in PVP to the Wildlands title and sticks with it's gameplay (4 member squads). Looking forward to October 10th and more additional campaign content after. Good job Ubisoft.
Still not better then Rainbow six siege 😏
Iam hard
omg omg so excited!!!!
🥇
Add Battle royal please🙏🏻
Did somebody said assassin?
You got to add a battle royal/PUBG mode. it would be very popular if you do it right and the game has all the things it needs like vehicles, weapons and good map
I love it as pvp but i don't love it as 4v4, We want it like SOCOM 8v8 and 16v16, There are some problems i will mention, When the enemy throw the gernade why it's so seen why?? It must be unseen you just hear it sound when it hits the ground only, Please don't make the gernade seen to the players, also why you can mark the enemy why?? please guys make it more reality!! You can't mark the enemy in real life! i don't like that you should make the players can't mark each other.
Did you release this before releasing 3? Cause its says Class Trailer 4/4 and I only see 1,2,4 not 3 xD At least on this Channel IGN has them all xD
OH lordie lord please don't let this dlc have achievements on this I've already completed this 100% and I do not want to go back to this game.
This has become one of the GREATEST shooters of ALL time!i couldnt stop playing the Beta and now a release date,CANT WAIT!!!👍😃
well i guess its about time they release a damn pvp mode lol! looks kinda unique too lol
Hello UBISOFT! i saw some problems that ruins the game, First the gernade is so weak and it's seen to the all players so this is so bad for the players it doesn't give excitement to the game, If you make the gernade like SOMCOM no one sees the gernade only you hear it sound when it hits the ground and then you die lol it will be really exciting and great for the players. Second problem is when you see your enemy and start firing the enemy gets marked so this is really bad because the enemy was my victim if the enemy got marked all my team would start firing. I love the game but i hope you fix these problems i mentioned, Make it real make it like SOCOM, Trust me if you did! all the people would play this game.
Okay, the only issue I have. Where is Trailer 3? It jumps from 2 to 4
Can’t wait! It’s been a hot min but ready to go ghost lol
Ghost Recon Is Back In Business !
Release date Finally! So excited for the full launch
Assassin = OP
Enforcer for life

7th comment
3rd comment
Yeesssss
bruh
Amazing mode
Oh
The assassin is my favorite class of all time
hello ubisoft where is 3/4
Do i agree ? That everyone here loves a big booty ?😏
Can the assassin climb roofs, leap into bales of hay, and kill people with hidden blades though?
Can u tell me the release of the pvp?
What happened to the third trailer?
this is almost like a new rainbow six siege only outdoors
Wouldn't want that sniper on my team.
That drone seems cheap allrdy lol
How about a rebel ops PVP game mode where one team in the building protects the radio from the other team who raids the building... \n👍👍👍
DOubtful i'll drop $60 for the full game, but I'd totally pay $30 for a standalone ghost war game...
invisible drone is a bad idea
That mask on the assassin looks cool, wish we actually had that as a customization option.
Everybody comment their favorite classes
why not 10 vs 10 ???????????????
Hey ubisoft You sock at all games You make but rainbow six You need to kick all The hackers and all The gliches😡
I can not play games , cause I have no GPU.
I don't like the idea of pvp in this game.
Nice Work ! Thx for the Video.
Can you build my PC? You're almost there...
This is a lady channel
this guy talks to much
did you just use usual mud from the side of a stream or mud with clay
Next video idea, \n\nWifi...\n\n\n\n\nSome of us can not survive without wifi...\nOk its just me...\n\n\nBye :(
Everything is good, until heavy rain  drop by.
Now you just have to invent religion and you can use those mudbricks to build some sweet ziggurats.
Ironically, human innovation also created religion.
I watched this whilst laying a mud brick of my own
This guy should make a bloopers video, surely he has hit his thumb a thousand times with those rocks.
So, in all, how long did it take to complete this project, start to finish?
what sticks are good to use to make fires with?
Ok dude, mud bricks are anything but primitive ... ancient Mesopotamians like summerians,  babylonians all used clay baked bricks for their houses, castles, walls, ziggurts. Unless you think that is primitive.\nThere is no way primitive cave men baked clay mud bricks.
The captions need to be tweaked. They disappear so quickly that I simply got annoyed and turned them off.
This mans parents must be very proud
This needs a disclaimer.  Host is not actually living a lone in wilderness.  He has a life outside of this video which is similar to most modern humans.  So if you think this ishow you would live if....its not posible because when cameras go off he goes home feed cleans up take care of yourself it's a health check up these doctors Pages doing and then for a few short hours comes and builds thanks with primitive technology to make a living if not part of it.
You should show how to make an animal fat lamp
Hey primitive technology.\nI found a video that has your title and thumbnail but is a entirely different video.\nHeres a link to the vid:  https://youtu.be/zfwPt1vxsjc
I love this content! I appreciate the work you put in. Not to mention the editing, I think a uncut or les cut video would be interesting
He went to monkey mode in the start
HOW IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE
Absolutely love ur videos man. Ur ability to work with raw, natural materials such as rock, wood, dirt/mud/clay etc., are fabulous. Now all ya need is a cave-woman to drag by her hair into ur cave. Then ur life is complete.
How long has he been out There? And how the hell is he still clean shaven?
What type of wood to use the friction fire starter?
Love your videos, man. Not only are your skills extremely impressive, the sounds of the woods around you are very calming. Watching you work brings about a state of peacefulness. Keep up the wonderful work.  😎
Always wonder if this is some kind of porn for females? Seeing as a man like this would be amazing back in the stone age xD
Dude, how about a video of the different types of torches people can make. Transportable fire bundles.
This dude is on a whole other level bc we still haven't seen how he is getting the electricity for his camera LMAO
Hey Primitive, just wanted to stop by and say good job on the videos and your skills. Have been enjoying your videos for about a month now. I do some camping/hiking/ Bushcraft and I am now enjoying learning from you and applying it to my adventures. Keep up the good work and can't wait to see more videos to come!
Man, I need to know how he gets wifi to upload. I can't even get a good internet connection at my house
Could he do naked and afraid or does he need his shorts? lmao
I respect your work
I can only aspire to this level of skill. Mad props to you, mate! Congratulations on your amazing work.
I love how he doesn't talk because it's annoying when people talk like ppl usually do
What if it rains?
Does no one else realise he has subtitles that legit explain everything hes doing?
This is so cool
I tried to make the bricks but they didn't turn out as strong, they sort of collapsed, any help for future?
To enjoy the full experience, listen to /watch?v=pTqsBuTkz_Q while watching the video.
It almost seems like he isn't going to a house to upload all of this
Does anyone else think that he measured the clay before putting it in the cube maker?

Can I ask why you don't have an actual domain name for your website rather than using wordpress.com ?
One day ur gonna be stuck in the wild and ur gonna be thankful for this dude😅
Dear Primitive technology, so many people on YouTube are copying what your doing but don't worry 😉 your the goat 🐐

559 dislike is some newbie fans who doesn't like we call yunho The Legendary King of KPOP 😂😂
The return of the king. I love the atypical rhythm. This is song is a worthy son of TVXQ's best song: rising sun.
This mv is the best where I have watched. This view must be 1 million. What happen with kpop fans this era? This is the  best quality, but kpop fans now  more choose popularity
i'm a newbie but i feel the *KING VIBES* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwtf
Anyway...  why I'm confused??
Damn! This MV needs more views! I'm not a fan of TVXQ but I have few of their songs.
I'm not worthy enough 🙇🏻‍♀️🤴🏻
Im a proud Cassie. \n\nAND WHY THE FUCK THIS MAKES ME CRY?? I REALLY MISS D OLD GOOD TIMES 😭😭

OMG you can just literally close your eyes and listen and FEEL the Kings of the East vibe through the song. It's definitely DBSK's song through and through. They've done so many concepts up to this point. Gosh I miss this vibe of what brought me into KPOP back when I was a teen. LEGENDS! RESPECT THE LEGEND YOU PLEEBS! NOW KNEEL BEFORE THE KINGS!

랩은 나만 이상하게 들리는것인가..
when will changmin and yunho sing as dbsk??
Cool . . . but doesn't really feel like a proper Star Trek intro sequence to me.
This looks like something HBO made.
My thoughts and it could be wrong... There is no musical motif... none that I find appealing anyway. The DS9 and Voyager themes have a great leitmotif. The TNG also has a good leitmotif. Where is the leitmotif? A melody? Feeling very ambivalent towards this new one...
LOVE!!!
Just watched the first two episodes not bad at all I enjoyed it :-)
Looks great to me!
Interesting. I like it. \nNot what I was expecting, but then I wasn't sure what I was expecting.
Na boa, que abertura GENIAL, incrível!
Se puderem, recomendo os colegas assistirem em uma televisão o vídeo, a abertura tem muito detalhe e muita textura, tem que ser em tela grande para ser aproveitada em todo seu potencial.
Isn't it a Fringe theme?
This smells like Bryan Fuller.
What is this James Bond?
Le,mbra GAME OF THRONES, LEONARDO DA VINCI com futurismo.. gostei.
Good theme, graphics don't seem quite right, feels like something HBO would do or better yet AMC that's the vibe I got from it but still at the beginning and at the end gave me goosebumps
Wow this looks cool, but where are the credits?
very bad choice of colours for a space sci-fi intro. also, is it me or all the shows have started to have similar openings?
I love this show already. Just from this opening alone.
Awesome Opening,  I could feel myself building inside one of Da Vinci's pieces and the instrumental music was quite awesome too, and when I heard the Trek theme strings, just after the Star trek Discovery title is displayed on screen, I  smiled and almost cried
Did anyone else notice how many slanted/diagonal camera shots they used in the show? really started erking me after a while, seemed like the ship was on its side. It's nice to see them doing something different to just exploring space, but i feel like they are straying to far away from the idea of star trek with what seems to be a klingon war, some parts were more star wars than star trek to me. Obviously have to give it at least a season to get an idea of their story idea before making wild claims of how good/bad it really is.
It's ok with me, it's not Russel Watson singing some dreary plop like on Enterprise
It's been a long road....
This has a very Westworld vibe to it. 😅
Pra quem está perguntando: Sim, essa é a abertura real lançada pelo twitter da série. Não tem os nomes dos atores/produtores/do Gene Roddenberry porque é uma versão clean feita pro marketing. No show mesmo isso vai estar tudo incluso.\n\nQue que eu penso dessa abertura: Os visuais são lindos e tão de parabéns, mas a música é muito silenciosa e genérica. Tirando as partes copiadas do tema da série original, não tem nada de interessante na música.
Está ainda sem os créditos...
Faith of the Heart will no longer be the worst Star Trek theme.
Muito bom.
SQUEEE!!!
Linda! Linda! Linda!
Uaaaaalll
Can't say i like it.
This must be fake as there's no actor's names and most crucially it doesn't say created by Gene Roddenberry
Épico, abertura de série de responsa
Not bad at all. \nThough it's a bit Game of Thronesesque, I think.
It looks nice but with the music and all it's kinda dull.
Nice visuals, shit music. No melody, no substance, no direction, no inspiration,  just canned sci-fi muzak. Oh well. It can always get better right?   :)
Michael Burnham is the stupidest character name ever.
if u can put this in trending, u can put the defenders opening credits in trending..
HOPE DWARF MAMBA LOGAN PAUL AND JAKE PAUL TEAM TEN CAN BECAME EXTRAS PROTAGONIST ACTORS  KLINGONS
Please be good Please be good Please be good Please be good

was waiting for Jack Sparrow to show up with this song
Were is the theme? its just a piece of music that meanders and goes no where.........
Why is this on the trending page?
When the violins kick in at 0:30, it really reminds me of legend of zelda gerudo valley: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THdRs7grqhE&t=0m23s
A música não chama atenção mas o visual tá fantástico
is it just me or does it sound like a star trek antherm mixed with harry potter ??
looks like the House opening sequence
TOS, TNG, DS9 and Voyager had/have great openings, Enterprise was/is horrible, this is even worse!
What year is it set 2040??
totaly rubbish, so we look at a CAD bluerpint for a minute! terrible ! give me Oriville any day ! Star Trek has lost it.
what shit is this? this is the generic crap we get in a shit ton of shows, doing a Trek intro should be so easy, have the Discovery flying across space with a great, memorable, inspiring theme.
Feels more like greys anatomy than star trek
at the time of watching this video has been uploaded for 2 hours, has 972 views and is on the trending page........good job youtube.......good job
Where's the melody Taylor?
I love the designing the ship part, but I feel that it should've transitioned into the actual ship and become the kind of star trek into which we've come to love (90s trek intros). The animations of the pops were odd to say the least and there aren't even names, it's just a blown out into trying to scream how TOS it is by showing phasers and communicators, it misses the point if you ask me. And wait, is that the empowered female with male name black ethnic first officer I see there? Yes it is, the original star trek was powerful by making everything normal, once you scream about something, the battle is lost, it isn't powerful. I don't even get how and why SJWs hate star trek, star trek is everything they stand for, they're just not able to see it because if they can fight and change something, they believe that they've done good work. Watch some TOS, or any star trek show, it is a great future where everyone gets on!
Just glad they didn't blow it like Enterprise!
Beautiful but feels more like a video game intro ... not particularly star trek. Also the intro music doesn't pull you in ... quite forgettable actually.  The intro music for next gen and voyager immediately pulled you in ... This is rather somber.
Cool intro but the musical score was incredibly Meh, so bland and flat.
It's been a long time... Getting from there to here...\n\nPart of me was waiting for it... Gotta be said.
Spent years watching Walking Dead impatiently waiting for the *insufferable* Sasha to die, just for her to suddenly turn up in the new Star Trek series? Nope, sorry, won't be watching. I know that's a totally unreasonable reason not to watch a show but I just cannot stand that actress.
The music is absolutely wonderful, but I'm not sold on the animation. If we had a traditional TNG/DS9/Voyager opening with the Discovery flying about in space with this tune in the background, it would be amazing.
So that’s it huh, we some kind of enterprise squad?
Well, at least it's not fate of the heart
Não sei o que pensar. É uma coisa lindíssima, mas totalmente inesperada para a serie. Sera mesmo a versao final / oficial?
Bom hj vou descobrir...se é a da série ou não.
total garbage
Shit.
RUBBISH, FORGETTABLE, BLAND
Absolutely horrific!
Wow, that sucks
No. Just... no.
this is bad
Destiny 2?
Sério?! Mereceia mais impacto. Lembrou Dr. House
Wrong pallete, space and yellow?
Não deve ser essa a da série! Onde está o Based upon.... E na minha opinião faltou o espaço....é série no espaço ou não? Boa, mas poderia ser melhor, muito melhor.
This show is for nerdssssss
It looks and feels like STD.
You are jokeing, the music is arfull and to put a cartoon title sequence for a big budget show like this, is terrible I can't believe it they might as well just thrown up the name of the show and 10 seconds of music, this is not star trek how cheap, I bet there is moor crap in-store and to show a communicator an a phaser they make it look like a baby's show now trekkers will be laughed at.
I thoroughly enjoyed watching all of the videos with Fiona.  what a great crew at this facility.  they should be very proud of their accomplishments.   I have followed the story and just wanted to let you know how impressed I am,  of your staff.  You can truly see how much they love this baby and ya know Fiona knows too.  she knows how much you love her too and that is the best thing ever.

TURN ON THE FLOOR PHONE I DONT WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU 404-393-9786
I remember when I paid $65 for a 30min diving lessons 2 years ago. Fiona gets it for free. LOL
I wish all zoos were like this one! Fiona is in great hands😀
These people are some of the best caregivers on the planet !
She has such a cute tongue.  It was so cute when she licked the side of her tank.  When hippos open their mouths I never noticed the tongue.  I love seeing her sink and jump underwater.  I wish I was that comfortable in the water.
When she opened her mouth to play with the hose >0< I AM DYING OF CUTENESSS AHHHH
So cute when she sinks to the bottom
I'm really starting to love hippos now!
I don't know why I get so nervous when she is in the water...I feel like she won't be able to get to the top in time to breathe ...I'm short of breath right now!!! Lol huff.....
So good to see Fi is doing so well
I've never seen a hippo fly before! She can swim very quickly through the water and she's getting big, too!
More feeding vids would be cool.  I used to live by Lincoln Park Zoo and would try to go by when they were feeding  the big cats.  Always interesting to watch what animals eat and how much.
Her cuteness and sweetness bring me 'Big Heart-Strokes' to almost death !!!  I really want to send my 'Big Love to Fiona' !!!
Very nice video, love seeing the progress and how you guys taking care of her so well! I wonder how old is she in term of human age.. a toddler?
So cute
She's adorable
She is so adorable ❤️
Omg this cutie!
Thank you - great Job - i Love fiona and sing the birthday Song all the day and this here in germany köln (cologne)  and all Look at me .  Thx for all.  Claudia hanak
poor Teresa looks like she could sure use a few hours sleep 🙁
Does she have her teeth yet
Who needs a therapist if I can just watch this video. I can watch this all day long. Again and again and again. wait, who's working to pay my electric, internet and dod food. Shiyt!
So sweet.
Te amamos, Fiona. Love from Brazil ❤
Amazing hippos cannot swim or float.
My little Fifi❤️
What a cutie
11:31 her chubby stubby lil' baby hippo legs paddling just melts my heart 💙💕💜
Elle est magnifique Fiona d'amour. Bisou de Moxhe en Belgique 😘
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Yay update from Fiona!
Fiona is having a Whole Foods level salad without dodging traffic. Where is justice!
Omg..cute alert!!!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️
I love her
She so cuter
CNN Sucks, Fiona Rocks!!
What's the ratio of Male:Females involved with the hippo? Seems like a female dominated workplace. Time to fire half the staff and make it 50:50 right? Females don't have any issue with this because it's all about equality.
Nice to see her progress in one video; she made an amazing comeback after being born so premature...only 29 pounds; I've seen cats that weighed only slightly less than that. :-) It would be nice too to see how they introduced her to her mom and dad, who have now totally accepted her presence and are very sweet and gentle with her, although they may not exactly realize she is their baby. That's really the best part of her story because it means she can grow up as naturally as possible for a zoo hippo, close to her mom and dad and learning from them; hippos aren't exactly monogamous animals and fathers usually don't do much childcare, but they are social and it's normal for them to live in groups. I like the new movement to help zoo animals grow up to be the animals nature intended them to be, rather than pets. Adult hippos are actually very dangerous and no responsible zoo would ever let a keeper swim with one, so it's good they're gradually weaning Fiona away from human contact.
How often does she spend time with her mother can u guys show her with her mother please
How long do you have to bottle feed her? And his her mom not producing mike where she can breast feed
sad that she doesn't have full time with her mom!
Why is this trending with 1.6k views, seems like youtube has some sort of agenda...
I wish the roof would come down on them..if only to shut up this hysterical pensioner..
Labour doesn't stand for it's old values and is just another party fighting for its own glory ...
i wanna be like him when i get old
So... If I wanted something I couldn't afford like a Ferrari, I should just borrow the money from a loan company? Anyone with any sense would say i''m mad. They'd be right, it would be a stupid thing to do. Lets scale that up to a country size borrowing and suggest its anything other than Mad. The only reason Labour can borrow so much money when they get in power is because of the house keeping the Conservatives do while they're in power. Lets try to be more like Germany and less like Greece. No one wants to be a slave to the central banks once they restrict the money supply. Look at what happened to Japan when they went on a spending spree? if anyone is interested watch Princes of Yen and youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5Ac7ap_MAY
Most people on 0 hour contracts are in the types of jobs that will be taken over by AI and machines. They're the types of jobs people don't normally stay in for long anyway.
And all the rest of it!
Remind me. Labour lost the election, yes? Because I'm getting a whiff of Kinnock here. I think the Labour Party is currently too busy counting their chickens. Never trust a chicken.
First?  YES DENNIS...YES!  xx one love xx
Skinner is the only true Labour MP , he puts his constituents first and has never veered away from his politics and views for personal gain unlike the rest of Labours poor excuse of MP's
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Lmao YouTube shoving this sh#@ down our throats
their will only be one Mr. Skinner
Dangerous party... Corbyn supports terrorism.
YES
Pls fix ur teeth
The guy looks like a British Donald trump
Borrow it regardless of being in dept already and have no means of paying it back.\nLabour bought in tuition fees under Blair did he not.
This American Veteran Family is Boycotting NFL!
Why are taxpayers subsiding corporations? Pay for your own stadiums! Pay the same taxes I do! This cronyism needs to end.
I'd be very interested to know what those kneeling are doing about the issues that they are trying draw attention too when the cameras are not on them.  Quite frankly I'm tired of listening too actors, athletes, and entertainers take stands when they lead the most privileged of lives that society has to offer and on the whole do so very little to give back or payback.  #hypocrites
Inside these lines, millionaire rapists, thugs and traitors run around and hit each other for the entertainment of castrated cucks. No thanks. Can't wait for the NFL to go bankrupt.
Unity? What a joke. Why wouldn't the NFL let the Cowboys wear a decal supporting the Dallas police?\n\nhttps://sportsday.dallasnews.com/dallas-cowboys/cowboys/2016/08/10/nfl-allow-dallas-cowboys-wear-arm-arm-decal-helmets-games
At this point all I see is the NFL letting politics get in the way of sports. I don't tune in to watch players take a knee,hold up a arm or anything else. I watch to forget about all the BS going on outside those stadium walls. These players have so many other platforms available to them to get their views outs. The field should not be a platform for these whining ass players to spout their opinions or anything else. They are being paid to do their jobs not give their opposition. Shut Up, Stand Up, and Do Your Job. #RogerGoodell #NFL #StandUpAndShutUp # DoYourJob#YourFired
I just became a NFL fan. Fuck the dotard
Sports is the most unifying thing in the world. You know there's a real problem when politics become involved. These men don't get paid extra or get a bonus for kneeling for that anthem.. so why don't we try addressing their problem? The POTUS is ruining the progress we made in the last 20-30 years.
notice that in the ad, when it shows a team on the sidelines, the players are standing
#TakeTheKnee ✊🏽🇺🇸
You piss me off that we cannot share this without having to come back here... fucking NFL
I have always loved football. I lived out of state from my home team my entire adult life and still felt like they were my team. I'm not fair weather. I'm die hard, born and raised. \n\nI stopped watching a lot of the games and didn't go to any for the last few years. I was very disappointed in the lack of response from the NFL on domestic violence. I was really upset by taxpayer funded and subsidized profits. I was just overall let down. I'm a huge fan. And the NFL is pretty consistent on dgaf about women fans. I was the one bringing friends and my husband to the game. I was the fan in the house and in my friend group.\n\nI applaud and am cautiously enthusiastic about this and the support for free speech that I have seen in the last week. Truthfully, I find it upsetting and typical that owners, coaches, the organization had nothing to say or were negative in their response where it concerned black men dying at the hands of state funded employees, who are NOT hired to be judge, jury, and executioner in a matter of minutes or seconds, but are hired to protect and serve (lack of training and faulty procedure are to blame, in part. Our systemic racism and lack of education on privilege and our history and how it is still happening right now is getting more to the root of it). \n\nIt is upsetting that no one had much to say about unity until the black men they knew were personally and profanely attacked by Trump. He is the President. And he is spending his time in this way, between attacking others and golf games, he's made the NFL a target. He has been this all his life. And doubled down during the election. And many NFL owners, coaches, players, were supporters. How you didn't see this coming is unbelievable to me. But. Here we are. And I am happy to see the NFL kneel for free speech. I am happy to see his divisiveness called out. I'm a bit disappointed you didn't do it until the black men you personally know were called names. The black men you didn't know were murdered and you had nothing to say. But that is the way privilege has always worked. Always. It's predictable. But I didn't expect the NFL to stand and kneel together in the way that happened this weekend and I acknowledge it, despite it's predictable faults. \n\nAs for Trump and his bad ratings rants, I'm watching and I'll get to a game this season. I'm proud of your support of free speech and protest. It was a priority for this nation when it was founded. It's in the constitution for very good reasons. At the time and throughout our history. I'm giving you a chance again. Thank you for standing and kneeling  for what is right. And for not remaining silent when a bully tried to fuck with your teammates. It took awhile. Don't ghost them. \n\nI've loved football for as long as I can remember. It's not more important to me than peoples' lives. So let's see some doubledown on helmet and head injury research. Get your game together on supporting your players and fans of all colors and genders. And keep being a unifying organization. I'm here. And this is a start. It's a really great start.
Awesome! It's about time people stood up for what's right in this country. We are this country. Our flag is us. My father fought in this country for ALL Americans Proudly . He was white but America is all colors under one flag. If you don't beleave that your not a true American. The flag or the anthem isn't the problem. The problem is the President who has no respect for all Americans by being a white supremacist and any one who disagrees with him, well...you see how he has to throw a fit like a three year old who wants his way because he has been told The King is naked. At least he must think he's king because as an American and not an American who's had their blood spilled like my family. Our flag nor our country has been disrespected or instead of a knee down they'd turn their backs. I think it's an awesome way to show the President himself we are one and do not want to be divided by Nazis, KKK or white supremacist or those hate groups who support him including him being supportive to these hate groups. We are still along way from equality for more groups then people of color, transgender, woman's rights and more but we've come a long way and we've worked had toward a better future. Why would anyone support a President who's trying to tear up what bright future moving forward and being all under one flag? He not bringing us together to be one proud country, he's doing everything at every petty opportunity to spew twisted hateful things and looks for someone to stroke his ego. He's more concerned about tearing us apart then all of us working together, respecting our differences and honoring and celebrating that. A good president would se us as ONE nation under God, all of us. To stand united. After all we are the United States. He could put his little pettiness on the side you'd think and help this country. Help those in the Hurricanes, help the people of our great country to not die because of the health crisis. Who cares if it's Obama or something else, figure out a way to help not hurt, divide and destroy!
What piano riff/song is this?
You people who are so gung ho on America please watch the documentary “The Tillman Story”. A man and former NFL player who got screwed over and killed for his sincere belief for fighting for this country. He was a man who believed just like you. But never would his family believe that this government, who is supposed to be the embodiment and goodness of what the flag stands for would stoop so low as to cover up and not give straightforward answers relating to his death. And there are so many other examples besides him that I could be here for days. So, you can hype up ol’ glory all you want but until justice is served for him and others by some individuals in government who want to step up and really represent what you think the flag is, but really isn’t, but should be I suggest you just keep watching football and stop being so gullible about what this country and flag represent. Because at the end of the day when the you know what hits the fan, unless it benefits “them” it ain’t YOU they represent as Pat and his family unfortunately found out. That’s how you know it mostly has nothing to do with race but more with keeping their individual interests at the forefront. Unfortunately, to them for that reason Pat and anyone else was/is expendable. Wake up!
I was used to respect NFL. No more.
Inside these lines will soon be no more players because these morons have ruined the game.  The NFL IS NOW DEAD!
American Football is boring as hell. 5 hours of watching a game that plays for 30seconds then stops for 5 minutes because some geezer drops the ball. The least fluid, most stop and start sports game

I want sports to help me escape the World and it's bullshit. Now sports is forcing said bullshit on us.
46 years ago my first job was with the NFL. I am done watching grown man knelling before our National Anthem.  The NFL just lost my support.
Until you cross the line > https://youtu.be/bId3_OEl9G4
This video doesn't say anything that addresses racism. Needs an end title like The NFL is committed to racial equality or a statement like that. Too wishy-washy.
9/24/17 - Just like that, 47 Million Americans said F**K the NFL
Congratulations to the Jacksonville Jaguars. Today you protested the flag of the only country to fight a war to end slavery and honored the flag of the very country that brought Africans to the Americas. As slaves. The Darwin awards are going to have a lot of competition this year
Apparently not every one of your employees got the memo that today was disrespect America, cops, and the military day at the NFL.  FYI, today is also Gold Star Mothers Day.  Good job timing your childish sit in on a day that honors the mothers of members of our military who gave all so that these ungrateful scum bags can disrespect their sacrifices.\n\n\nhttps://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2017/9/24/16357738/alejandro-villanueva-u-s-army-veteran-lone-steeler-on-field-national-anthem
Inside those lines, they are not gods to be worshiped. Most of  these people owning, playing and watching these games, are to embarrassed to praise the Lord Jesus, who created them and died for their sins, so that they would be able to have eternal life, the greatest gift in the universe.  But they all worship a game, and mere men that run around with a ball. Most players and fans, yell, scream, fight, and act like idiots, and they are not embarrassed to do any of that. \nRoger Goodell NFL Commissioner said that President Trump's comments drew sharp criticism among professional athletes, and who called Trump’s remarks “divisive.” No, it was not President Trump's remarks that were divisive, no, the kneeling players, have all caused divisiveness, long before President Trump said anything. These players are disrespectful and defiant, just like the protesters on the streets. They can try and hide behind their outfits and the NFL,  but none of that will do them any good. All the one's who are disrespectful, defiant and dividers, have already come out, all over the United States, in every area of life. And the dividing lines are from the Lord Jesus, the King of Kings. Be very careful what you are doing, and who you are following, for these are the end of the last days.....\nMatthew 25:31-46New King James Version (NKJV)\nThe Son of Man Will Judge the Nations\n31 “When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then He will sit on the throne of His glory. 32 All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats. 33 And He will set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the left. 34 Then the King will say to those on His right hand, ‘Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: 35 for I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in; 36 I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.’\n37 “Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink? 38 When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You? 39 Or when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?’ 40 And the King will answer and say to them, ‘Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.’\n41 “Then He will also say to those on the left hand, ‘Depart from Me, you cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels: 42 for I was hungry and you gave Me no food; I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink; 43 I was a stranger and you did not take Me in, naked and you did not clothe Me, sick and in prison and you did not visit Me.’\n44 “Then they also will answer Him,[b] saying, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to You?’ 45 Then He will answer them, saying, ‘Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.’ 46 And these will go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”
Considering the NFL has a contract with the pentagon to promote the RW version of military patriotism, I sincerely doubt we'll see a true philosophical discussion regarding constitutional patriotism from a league that's sold it's soul for riches. I see a conflict of prayer circles on a field devised and promoted by money changers at the expense of it's gladiators. I'm ashamed to have played the game in college.
Does the NFL really want to double down to fail a straight-face test?  This ad is just laughable from a league that normalizes violence (domestic abuse, crime, etc.), whose execs cover up the brain damage resulting from relentless hits and one with a longstanding history of early deaths. Best to let these out-of-control leagues die their own death, and quickly, I hope.  This latest self-indulgence from players, who probably can't even string two sentences together about the actual history of the Stars Spangled Banner, is nothing more than the loud cry of ceasing to be relevant (can someone say empty stadiums and declining ticket sales).  I am not down on football altogether, my family watches select college games where players have real heart -- funny how that happens when you put love of the game first and don't live in some ridiculous circus born of eight figure salaries.
I'd still like to know how this display has changed anything. It hasn't. We still have people rioting in St Louis two years after Ferguson. So you can kneel, demonstrate all you want but how about take action and go do something in your communities. It seems to me this kneeling is an easy way out and a way for players to get their 5 minutes of fame on ESPN. It accomplishes nothing except for irritating 1/2 of the country. The media does a fine job on bringing racial Injustices to our attention, I don't think NFL players heightened awareness, just irritated people more.
Games > National Symbols\nIf you think that you have played too much football
If people should stand for an anthem, then why shouldn't people stand and pray to God Almighty? Taking God out of everything is where it's all went wrong.😇
NFL players and owners now acting like Hollywood a-holes.  Just a bunch of millionaire malcontents espousing leftist, anti-American politics.  Take away their money, and the media limelight, and they're nothing more than a bunch of immature, spoiled, wife-beating men who get together, dress up in uniforms, and then play a kid's game.
Too bad these narcissist millionaires will never discuss what the protests are supposed to be about. https://www.blackandblondemedia.com/2017/09/23/kneeling-players-need-look-mirror-insulting-trump/

All of these people who are mad at the NFL be mad at yourself for refusal if to grow beyond what you were taught. Have fun bowling, eating, or watching some other shows during football season. Just remember it's only a small amount of you guys. Y'all are dumb as hell if you think the entire world feels the way you do. I also would like to know have you tried your racism ( you know name calling and such) blatantly in the face of some of these black ppl you claim you hate? The NFL will gain more fans than they will lose them. #ignorant #goodbye
This debate should be between the corporations and their customers. I just wish I didn't have to give them a dime. That's why the true answer is to ABOLISH ALL TAX CUTS AND CRONYISM THEY GET. Let them pay for their own stadiums. We should charge them retroactively. No hotel taxes should go to these race enablers. Make it illegal for local governments to bribe these teams to set up shop or do spring training. Take it all away. Let it be a free market. Let the consumers reject these asshole nigger lovers.
INSIDE THESE LINES are a bunch of senseless, self-centered, childish millionaire malcontents who have no respect for the country that gave them the opportunity be where they are at.
Please don't act as if Trump has caused this problem, it has been going on since last year. People have been arguing about it since it first began. It's sad that people don't seem to understand that yes, they have a right to their own beliefs and opinions but what they don't have the right to do is disrespect the paying customer. They can do it on their own time on their own dime. Our home for one will be boycotting the NFL and any other sports league that thinks they can belittle the people in my family that have served in the military.
Inside these lines all view points are welcome and we respect each other. Just make sure your viewpoint isn't excessively conservative or we have to fire you... but disrespecting the flag, praising terrorists, beating your wife, children.. thats all good of course.
I won't be watching tonight's game or NFL network for some time after what I just saw the Jags and Raven's do during the anthem.  I'll probably just go bowling instead.
Boycott the NFL.
NFL sucks now
#BoycottNFL #BoycottNFLSponsors Disrespecting our flag and country will not stand!!
This is good. https://www.facebook.com/newlypress/videos/1891423541122018/
I wonder how many of these America-loving military-loving people supported Trump? The same guy that's a noted draft dodger. The same guy that said of John McCain and other POW's I like people who weren't captured. The same guy that attacked a gold star family (the Khan's). And the same guy that defends the confederacy (a bunch of traitors to the flag that he now claims to love).
Yeah, NFL (National Felons League), preach unity while practicing division and defending those who hate America, the police, and those who died defending it.  That's certainly a winning ticket.
How dare you put Pat Tillman in this video. Do you think Pat Tillman would condone these people taking knees and disrespecting the flag he died for? Disgusting
Unity?  How are you promoting unity when you allow your spoiled ingrate millionaires to attack the very people who are providing a safe and secure venue for them to play in?  The message they are sending is this: cops lives do not matter, if a criminal is black he can kill a cop any time he wants.  That's the message the NFL has now adopted.  You absolutely suck and I hope the NFL goes bankrupt.
Slightly off topic...\n\nCurious. Why is it that many players for the Ravens and Jags took a knee during the playing of the national anthem of the United States, yet stood for the national anthem of the United Kingdom? It seems strange to me that these players would kneel for the anthem of the nation that gives them (and anyone) the freedom to be employed in a multi-million dollar business, and allowing them to live their lives as they see fit, yet stand for the anthem that enslaved most of their ancestors, and most of the continent of Africa. \n\nOn a personal note, I find it appalling that these people are making a spectacle of themselves for misguided reasons at best. These people take a knee for 'police brutality'? Read crime statistics and you'll notice that more whites are shot by police than blacks are, and for the number of blacks shot by police to be equal to whites it would take law enforcement about 40 years at current rates to become equal. If you look at statistics, people of all races get shot by police for not following simple instructions. You want to resist arrest and fight the cops? You want to shoot at a cop? You want to try to run from a cop? Yeah, good luck with that.\n\nFurthermore, why is it that 13% of the population (Which is more like 7% since black women generally don't murder) responsible for 51% of the murders in the US? Why is it that a black man is 80% more likely to be murdered by another black man? In just the city of Chicago from 2001-2010 there have been nearly 7500 blacks murdered by other blacks. Think about that. More black people have been killed by other blacks, than all the soldiers that have been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan in the same amount of time.\n\nIf these players were taking a knee as a way of showing the problems in the black community, I would a little less appalled about their actions. \n\nHowever whilst I agree they have the right to protest, the president has the same right to call them out on it. Also keep in mind the 1st Amendment only applies to the government, not private industry. If I did something along the same lines at my place of employment, I would probably have my company lose 50% of its customers, or customers that I dealt with on a personal level, then I would be fired, and for a good reason.  The only reason this commercial is a thing, is simply due to the fact, behind closed doors, the NFL is feeling the heat, and/or beginning to shit their pants. The NFL ratings and sales are down over the last 3 seasons. When the NFL, and broadcasters, (CBS in particular) lose $200 million in advertising revenue alone, in just a few weeks into the season, you know the shit is hitting the fan. Look at the last Thursday night game as an example. There were tons of empty seats. Hell, tickets were being sold for as low at $17. This commercial is a weak attempt at best to try to quell the rising anger many Americans are feeling from the politically left, and the social justice warriors.
GO NFL. FUCK DONALD TRUMP.
Just realize who pays your salaries. Not Trump, you are pissing off the American people, best of luck in your protests, but the fans will decide the fate of the NFL. I can learn to like rugby.
Love that video.  The end was on point.
Ignore the spoiled child that couldn't get in with the cool kids and protest as much as you'd like.
Hello friend I am like and subscribe your video channel please subscribe my channel
Pat Tillman would not appreciate the use of his image to promote disrespecting, anti-American sons of bitches.
All it took was a 71 year old man to turn a bunch of manly football players into wimpy whiny girly boys\n\nI won't pay my hard earned money to be putting up with this. \n\nI want to be entertained, not lectured by a bunch of spoiled bazillionaires.
Football is a form of entertainment. I resent having to put up with political football. There is a place for dissent. It has no place on the field whether it is refusing to enter the field while the anthem plays or as players take a knee. If I wanted politics I'd know exactly where to go. Since it has now entered the stadium I refuse to participate in the division it has engendered.
The NFL is shit!
Worthless if they think that will change my mind about gutless cowards disrespect the flag, the anthem, the government, police and the military the NFL is dead wrong, I am telling my friends all this can be protested before the game or after the game, the NFL does not have to do it during the national anthem. If the want a protest find do it some other time, but since the damage is done and we now know the NFL and their players are anti-American then that leaves this veteran no other choice but to boycott the NFL. After a loosing season of revenues the they may come to their senses and figure another way players can voice their opinion, but not during the national anthem if they hate America that much they need to leave. Boycott the NFL, which will stand for Not For Long.
NFL games are big service businesses.  It is the patrons/fans that patronize their services and products that made them big.  Soon or later the NFL  Team owners and management will realize their bottom line is going down because clients are getting insulted and will become discontent whenever NFL players show disrespect to our Flag and  National Anthem.
The NFL doesn't hold a monopoly on Blacks and Whites getting along. Disgusting ad.
Lol... Why is kneeling disrespectful when practicing your right to protest is the American way but waving the confederate flag which stands for treason  is not disrespectful to the America!? We fought, black and white for freedom to express ourselves and now that's disrespectful? A lot of yall need to do yall homework. Yall crying tears over the wrong things. The first person she'd their blood for America was a BLACK MAN. There's nothing wrong with protesting by kneeling. People are actually more upset about these quiet peaceful protest then they were about the confederate flags and monuments being removed. They talk about criminals who hate the police and the  confederate flag celebrates criminals who can't get over that they lost.
Screw the NFL
Trump 2020
After watching the NFL every weekend for the last 30 years, we are finished with the NFL and will never watch a game or buy a ticket again.  They can choose to protest whatever they want, and we can choose to not watch or attend games.  Everyone I know who was an NFL fan is doing the same.  Members of two clubs I belong to have also demanded that NFL games not be played in the bars.  This is the beginning of the end of the NFL.
NFL disrespects the AMERICAN GROUND they stand on--ANTI AMERICAN FILTH
The NFL is kind of a cultural institution. I don't think that Trump can win a fight with them. Presidents come and go, but football is forever.
Dope 💯❌💯
I just watched this ad & I have to wonder why are these players disrespecting America?\nDo they even know why they are disrespecting America?
GOOD ON YOU, NFL!!  GOOD ON ROGER GOODELL!!  THANK YOU FOR THIS!  Now, let's demand an end to innocent Americans being shot and killed on our streets.
TOTAL BS
Trump threw gasoline on a simmering racial fire. The unity between players, owners and hopefully fans can put it out. Don't let him poison sports with his phony flag waving. Real men are not threatened by peaceful protest.
Sadly, Trump seems to have once again divided the poor people in America who need good, affordable health care, education and opportunity. While Trump sparks controversy about statues and anthems, Congress continues to let down the people who need a good government to make their lives better.
Inside these lines, we don't have to spend a dime of our money to you arrogant, overpaid, entitled, disrespectful idiots. Interesting that that video didn't show one clip of the players kneeling during anthem, if you're so proud of it, why wasn't it in the video? #BOYCOTTNFL
Today is the worst day ever, not only both of my teams lost, but politics is in sports and I fucking hate that, stick to sports. Awesome commercial by the NFL.
Good, let the whole damn stadium sit until that childish, hot head of a president is out of office!
Savage answer to pundits who still don't get it
I just want to take a moment here and say that I LOVE cum
The president needs to work on making America great again! So far, he's not doing such a good job!
I'm not a football fan but I have nothing but respect for the players that are protesting. The way the NFL is backing them makes me think better of them as an organization. #Resist
This is a wise response to the divisive influence of the Man who occupies the White House...who should know better.
What is the song on this commercial?
Steven Spielberg is not allowed to die. \n\nSimply the most imaginative film director that has ever lived and a diverse body of work to prove it.
This is going to be the best documentary ever!
DiCaprio should work with Spielberg again.
I can't wait to see this! :-)
Steven Spielberg is The King of Filmmaking : )
Thats gonna be awesome
Schindler's List is legit the best movie I've ever seen
My favourite director, my idol... he is a legend.
When I was a child he was the reason why I started to love the movies. Now, when I'm an adult, he is the reason why I chose working in the movies.
Jurassic Park\nET\nIndiana jones trilogy\nSchindlers list\nJaws\nSaving Private Ryan\nMen in Black (producer) \nBack to the future (producer)\nLand before time (producer)\nWho framed riger rabbit (producer)\nGoonies (producer)\nThis fucking genius was the voice of my entire childhood through adolescence.
It was 1993.. I was 4 years old..and the only memory I still have from that time is that glass vibrating and me asking my dad in the theater what is it?...
No Tom Hanks ?
Some of my first memories are watching movies with my folks. Born in 1980 in lower middle class rural Kentucky. Mr. Spielberg was my hero. Anything he could dream up was possible I thought. What a great time to be alive
Imo When it comes to longevity and churning out top caliber movies over a long career The only director that rivals this man is the other director in this Trailer Mr. Scorcese. Scorcese is a crazy one He quite possibly hasn't had a bad film in 50 plus years
Here's somebody who was truly born to make motion pictures.
Somebody put this man on a bill.💵
I will watch it. \nI grew up with his movies.
who's that old man?
John Williams music is throughout.  No need I was wrong
Cannot *recall which 'Bruce', went^ *display UK?!? \n\nHope (possiBly foreLorn)., beYond likely yadda-yadda & *Praise this may show a *vidClip📹 of its *tour.\nWithin 3ft either mk2, mk3 ???
I like what Steven says. A lot of his films come from a part of himself he can't articulate so it shows up in his films. I can kind of relate to that.
Stephen Spielberg is my favourite director along with Martin Scorsese, Christopher Nolan and Antoine Fuqua.
After Jurassic park I knew I wanted to be a director
Excited for this one!
He's such a nice guy
More, more, more, more... Mr. Spielberg you are my idol
Is Spielberg the best director of all time? Perhaps\nBut no one even comes close the the amount of classics he's made
Ferociously tugging my dick to images of the BFG right now. Thanks Spielberg.
He has some so-so movies, but his work is always top notch. I can't wait to see this.
Will be my fave HBO doc! If not, top 2!
Do Tarantino next!  This looks amazing
Inspiration to Filmmakers from all over the World. Institution of Film making. There is no Words for One and only Mr.Spielberg.
Leo should work with Speilberg again..
This is going to be the best documentary ever.
About fucking time they made him a documentary! 😭😭😭😭
Can't. FKN. Wait. For. This!!!!!
They got EVERYONE for this. Leo Dicaprio, Christian Bale, Daniel Craig, Tom Hanks, Blanchett, Neeson, Scorsese, JJ Abrams, Ralph Fiennes, hoffman, George Lucas, and even frickin Daniel Day Lewis
Our father, who art in cinema
Before he adapts my favorite book of all time, Ready Player One, I’m definitely seeing this documentary
strangely cut trailer but i love me some spielberg so i'm watchin!
So stoked. So stoked. So stoked. So stoked. So stoked. So stoked. So stoked. So stoked. So stoked\n\nBut why does everybody on camera have a lisp? Even DiCaprio has one.
The greatest film maker in film making history, hands down!
I've never seen a man who changed cinema and animation as much as this brilliant person. (sniff!)
One of the greatest directors to ever walk on earth ❤️ 🎥
The Greatest Movie Legend Ever Lived
Spielberg !!!!!!!!
Filmmaking genius, he is!
This documentary is going to be amazing !
Spielberg is movies.
Morons.
Genious.
Eastwood
Superb

Yes! Janet Maslin!
Than you :)
Where was JOHN WILLIAMS!!!
❤
thank you HBO!
Wow.
Goosebumps. Everywhere.
Yes!!!!!!!!!🙌
Kudos!
First👌👍
Schindler's List is, without a doubt, his best movie.
El mejor director de las últimas décadas...el mas grande e inigualable Steven Spielberg..
Liam neeson's movie name..?
He raped Indiana Jones.
The Master. And when the other Master JW is scoring, it's perfection.
The greatest ever.
Dont make these, start making Indiana jones 5 I can't wait til 2019 or 2020
Fascinating. Never actually got into Spielberg's history. He's a frustrating film maker. Genius at times, mediocre at others. Ridley Scott has this problem too. But for setting the bar so damn high, he'll always be a legend.
God... so pretentious. He's lost his way as a storyteller. What an insufferable moron.
Check out the Directors Series Video Essay — STEVEN SPIELBERG: POPULIST — http://bit.ly/2jXrNEL
His films up to the 90s were amazing. Then blah. I will for sure watch this though....
BFG? Lol
The only movie that DiCaprio was in with Steven was Catch me if you can. I did not like that one.
Last generation: Steven Speilberg\nCurrent generation: Christopher Nolan
Once upon a time his name meant something. \n\nToo bad most movies nowadays have lost their wow factor. Not even Pixar impresses anymore. \n\nAnymore, cinema is just a deluge of annual superhero movies. It stinks.
The first movie I ever loved was Jurassic Park. I've rewatched that movie a million times. This man is a legend of cinema.

Oh look another Jew
Kubrick
Fucking Spielberg? Even though he's a legend. He's no where near the caliber of Kubrick, Scorsese, Tarkovsky or even fucking Kurosawa. I'm sure they've had more impact on modern film more than Spielberg
It's just a shame that Spielberg today can't create the same great films he made in the 70s, 80s and 90s.
Nah.... You aren't at the level of Stanley Kubrick..... Trust me :)

Hurtful truth: Lizzo's latest videos were directed by shlongs. I miss her old wardrobe of t-shirts, hoodies and baseball caps. So sick of dudes pornifying everyone I care about.

I actually like you more with a brows! So fresh and youthful
I liked her with instagram eyebrows and It would look really good with the natural brows with MORE hair than she drew.
You look good with eyebrows, specially the second one..
Kudos to you for having some fun :).
I liked 2 the best but you look beautiful without them
I kinda want to shave my eyebrows off, cuz you look amazing and I have eyebrows in general
Love #3\nEyebrows make you look more warm & friendly and less cold
She looks so good with brows!  Good with out too tho
You look younger with brows. But I agree that you look really great without them, it definitely suits and highlights your features and aesthetic
Were your natural eyebrows alike to the make up eyebrows? Did you recognize yourself from the past?
Yep, #2 was the best.\nEdit: even tho you are very pretty no matter what.
I love all of these looks on you, but I am definitely partial to your precious alien princess face that you normally rock.
Wow you looked beautiful with all three but my favorite is one and two. Number three should be just for special events. I personally don't like them so obvious and painted on any one. She is extremely talented !
You look so awesome with brows, damn. It seriously makes you look like a runway model.
I am amazed how good you look with eyebrows. BUT the no eyebrow looks is more authentic.  so don't listen to what I like . bahahahhaha
Also you look younger
It literally made no difference the first one. You could totally wear that and no one would notice 😂😂
You are properly not use to them dear but they look great on you xxoo like #2 as well :)
You look sooooo good with the 3# and also younger!!! It smooths your face and armonize it. I really like your style without eyebrows but their fits you more than expected! Love it!
You look so stupid without brows ... Brows make you so beautifull and young ...
I think you are more beautiful without  eyebrows... you are so special, and you look so pure. \nBut of course even with eyebrows you are very, very pretty. :)
I like number 1 or 2! I think It makes you look younger/ friendlier! Not that you're bad without them, just that with them, you are more friendly looking!
Adore the natural first look! Jenny is beautiful regardless though <3
The second version looked so amazing on you!!!
Holy shit I just realized how important eyebrows are. The second one looked so good on you!
Number 2 for sure...you look really good in eyebrows
She looks good with brows. 2nd one looks best.
oh my god you look fabulous either way
Love the second look
You look so much younger with brows on 😶 anyway, you look cool and stylish whathever you do (but first one was the best)
I much prefer her with eyebrows (I even kinda like the last ones!) but she's more than entitled to do whatever she wants with her face. I have purple hair and people always say I should go back to brown, that doesn't mean I'm ever gonna do it! Everyone should learn to live their lives how they want and not care what others think.
I didn't know what I would think about this... I thought it would look like other people but I think it actually looks bizarre. Not bad not good but maybe normal? But then when I looked again it is actually distracting on you. I can't even put into words that make sense lol you look so good without them that I can't process your face with eyebrows haha
From far the 90s one looks super good but the second one is the best
#3 is beautiful but all of them looked amazing!
You look like a completely different person. Definitely not mean but absolutely gorgeous and forever young. #3 are my fave.
I thought you would look weirder with eyebrows but you still look great! \nI love Alexandras instagram btw, I've been following her for a while. I think I found her in Veganer i Sverige ✌🏻
shaving eyebrows isn't minimalistic at all, it's an extra effort that doesn't even fit in a minimalistic daily routine, isn't it? Plus it looks better, just let them grow and do nothing to it..
I love this :) I have a question for you: are you vegan? :* Love your channel!
i think a mix between the first and third one would be the best
2nd one looks great! You shoud think about growing your eyebrows back!
You look like a completely different person with eyebrows! I do prefer the second look. Thank you for the video :o)
You look so different with brows. But honestly you look mush better without brows. Honestly you look good either way.
With your delicate features and fairer skin/eye/hair color, less is more.  The scant eyebrows #1 looked better to me.  The darker, thicker ones at the end were way too much.  Plus, what happens in a rain storm?  Your eyebrows would run!  Stay with what you have.  It works.
I'm sorry, but I gotta disagree with all these brows, especially the last one. 90s brows are not that sharp. Look at any model in the 90s and their brows are big, bushy, unkempt, slightly defined but they were big and bushy or the extreme opposite was very thin, plucked eyebrows, eg drew berrymore going through her awkward plucked phase. Or the opposite look at Madonnas. I take that back, i liked the first set of brows she gave you but I'm sorry, the 90s brow totally disagree. Fun experiment though.
I think you look better with brows just because I think brows frame the face but I also get the point why you shave off yours so you do you and every single person is beautiful if they fell beautiful and I don´t get the hate on this and your other video. People shouldn´t be mean just because they don´t like something. Everyone should do whatever they prefer so please stop the hate, not just on this video but on everything and everyone!Ps.: Alex good job!! Kisses from Vienna!!!
You look normal with eyebrows, very pretty and gives you warmth in the face. But maybe you want to look abnormal, and that's also pretty. My fave were #2 and #3.
I think number 2 but with slightly lighter colour and you'd need a dark eyeliner to make your eyes stand out. With eyebrows you look a little grumpy though, either way, I like it 💗
Am i the only one who doesn't like eyebrow's in general?!
wow, I definitely agree with the comments... For some crazy reason you look so much younger with eyebrows. The 2nd ones looked the best.
You look beautiful with all the looks xx
I think you look best without brows..it suits you. Also you don't look old to begin with.. so I disagree with all these comments about brows making you look younger somehow. More common maybe.
You look so much younger with number 3! Although you look amazing either way! <3
I kinda like #3 the best because it was such a dramatic change. You looked like a totally different person!
I thought you looked great in all of them but I loved the impact the third had and it made you look more expressive to me but you always look amazing without brows too!
You look great either way but as an ex brow stylist I didn't think these styles suited you as much as it would if they where just a little but thinner. They colour was great and they did look a bit natural.  I thought the second one was a bit too bushy at the front but the third was too sculptured.  But it doesn't really matter because you rock no brows!!!
The 3 brow was an actual Instagram brow and the 90s brow should of been way way thinner.
You look so much younget with brows xp
you look very much younger with brows,and your face looks prettier!
i love the first one!!! you look so much younger
I like #2 best then #3. You look friendlier. #1 was too pale and no eyebrows just looks mean.
I liked the eyebrows! Glad you decided to keep yourself without them though! It's very you!
I liked number one, but slightly browner toned, they looked grey. Number 2 was nice also. Both made you look younger. I think you should grow your own in to show what the natural line of them is like.
Loved them all on you, favorite was #1! Most natural looks are best. I felt you looked younger with brows. But of course, you do you. You prefer no brows, so no brows it is! You're beautiful either way ❤️
Jenny! You look youthful and gorgeous with eyebrows. Please grow them out. I like number two the best. You do not look like a forest troll with eyebrows. KEEP BROWS!!! Grow them out.
I love the first ones! You look great without eyebrows, but also great with the natural ones. :)
you appear really approachable with brows, definitely not meaner! <33
Eyebrows made you look like 16 years old. You are very pretty.
First: YOUR ASSISTANT IS FUCKING GORGEOUS HOLY SHIT\n\nSecond: You totally look like a different person with eyebrows. Beauty is different to everyone and I personally think you look so much better with eyebrows. HOWEVER, having no eyebrows is what makes you YOU and you’ve come to dominate the “no eyebrow high fashion vegan” type look lol. Whatever you choose is great.
Each eyebrow style made your face change. I thought it was great.
I thought I looked so good with the bitchy brows lol😀
The first was beautiful. She did a great job. It looked very real.
2.
2
Wowww no eyebrows or eyebrows #3 you slay either way Jenny! =)
#3 !
90's brows would be over plucked thin brows .
#3 for sure!!!
I like all 4
3
#3
2
MY GOD you're rocking those eyebrows!
no 2 :)
Woah, she literally looks like 10 years younger with the eyebrows (in a very good way). I think she looks amazing with them, but then again, it should be what she prefers :)
I think you'd suit better in lower brows, like I wanna see them closer to the eyes 👀
I like 3 !
loving look number 2!
U just look normal lol
The third ones look dope!
2
she looks best without eyebrows
i love 2 and 3!!!
They look great!!
You look younger
You look so younger
Gorgeous either way!😘
You slay every look!! Ahh so pretty!!
Hi, you look younger with eyebrows :)
Yes for eyebrows! Like number 3!
I seriously LOVE how you're just gazing at him lovingly, i think i'd be the same if freakin' PATRICK TA was doing my makeup.\nSort of like when you're tipsy and meet your new BFF in the bar bathrooms and instantly fall in love.
Victoria I’d love if you did a “if I went to prom lookbook” or something as i don’t even know where to look 😂

Omg I love his makeup looks that he does for celebs ♥️
such a luxe brand and patrick ta? you must have felt so spoilt👸🏼xx
Gorgeous 😘😘
Love it
Gorgeous but you look stunning without makeup too 😊
I was wondering what face suncream you would recommend for wearing in the sun with makeup?
Any makeup look, looks gorgeous on you 💗🌟
Stunning :D x
So glad you shared the full thing instead of cutting it for a Vlog!! You look gorgeous!
more close-up, please 😃 it looks lovely, but I couldn't see the details properly (as well as the final result)
This look is beautiful, feminine, clean, fresh.  I like the eyebrows, not too dark, subtle, feminine, and not too much contouring on the rest of the face.  Looks a bit more natural,  amazing!
Omg! Patrick ta .. love you!!
La mer is my fav skincare brand <3  love the look btw :)
I cringed when he rested his fingers on your face and eyelid to apply makeup. A good makeup artist knows better.  Did he sanitize his hands beforehand and why doesn't he have a type of sponge or cushion to hold between your skin and his hand?\nOf course, you looked beautiful as always.
The make up look so fab!!! Xx
Needs subtitles, no idea what he's saying half of the time
Makeup isn't really my thing, but Patrick had such a nice personality and you're always such a pleasure to watch that I loved this video!!
He looked like he was being so gentle!!!  I think I rub my face off 😂🤣
he seems so sweet and professional! This makeup looks amazing on you x
You look so prettyyy! I love it!!! I need a Patrick in my life hahah
Omg i love Patrick!!!! Such a great video babe xx
His hands are so damn beautiful!
I absolutely LOVED watching this, I found it such a calming & informative chat. I nearly choked on my olive when Patrick mentioned Tom Ford Sable Smoke lipstick, it's probably my all time fave!!!! Doesn't Patrick have the most amazing skin?\nHugs Adele xoxo
Ohhh you sassy pair you slay, this video is cute as. 😍😘
I think it's too zoomed out. Would wish for it to be closer
Amazing, from Brazil. :D
You guys are getting younger by each passing year, love it.
Beautiful, from Colombia. :) 💗
I was missing new music from you guys. Greetings from Mexico

great! Please return to Peru
I was blank as I could be, hearing voices telling me, “Walk away from everything”\nOh I wasn’t meant to go, far away from those I know, to some desolate below\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe were in the urban scene, where they grind the coffee bean, where the women are oblique\nAnd the boys are paper thin, ragged beards upon their chin, we were on the outside looking in\nRise above the present day, rise above the popular melee\nI see you the way you are, I see you the scar[?]\n\n[Chorus]\nWe were beautiful before this went down\nWe were beautiful before the years came, turned it upside down\nWe were beautiful before we got wise\nWe were beautiful with sky and blanket laying low\n\n[Verse 3]\nI am hanging on the line, I’m on duty all the time, I am your Samaritan on call\nI could try my best to heal, all the emptiness you feel, in the giving I will be a light[?}\n\n[Verse 4]\nWe were wrapped around our roots, nothing on except our boots, we were intimate around the waist\nWe were settling our scores, we were healing over sores, we were living out the pleasure that we lost\n\n[Chorus]\nWe were beautiful before this went down\nWe were beautiful before the years came, turned it upside down\nWe were beautiful for all time and space\nI will tell it to the sun and I will tell it to…\n[Verse 5]\nIf you listen to the night, we can heard the madmen fight, hear the foxes making out\nBut the people all immune, sleeping silent in their rooms, growing bodies with their sleep\nMaking plans inside their heads, making love to shallow friends\n\n[Chorus]\nWe were beautiful before this went down\nWe were beautiful before the years came, turned it upside down\nWe were beautiful before we got wise\nWe were beautiful with sky and blanket fueling up[?}\n\n[Chorus]\nWe were beautiful before this went down\nWe were beautiful before the years came, turned it upside down\nWe were beautiful for all time and space\nI will tell it to the sun and I will tell it to your face
Vc vai escutando no buss e se imaginado em um clipe!!! #ameiii

Perhaps you folks should think about retiring & moving on--perhaps take-up painting, or photography; you were great once B&S, but this is just plain awful.
Sounds good except for the ridiculously rapid-fire beats that everyone thinks are required for modern music.  It's overload and not necessary.  Just be you.  It's good enough and better than most.  So glad they didn't throw a bunch of whoa whoa whoas in there too just to be trendy.  That's even worse than machine gun beats.
Yuck...pedal steel.
I like Aguero !!!
GG 2ez
Ederson is a family man.
Cmon city Chelsea next!!
Love Mendy for trying hard to learn English. Top lad. Hope his injury isn't serious and he's ready for the Chelsea game
You wanna hear a joke  \n\n\n\n\nArsenal winning the epl
That cappppp ............................ #Mendy
I love how the fans in other side of that mirror are like.. knock-knock.. notice me senpai😍
Plz maul chelsea
Sane is always on his phone
We will win the league unbeaten.
I have to say, you Citizens are playing fantastic football so far. Looking forward to our clash at the Bridge. Cheers! #checity
Top of the league on goal difference 👍👍👍
Those stairs get the sh** out of me. I hate them lol
6:32 i really hate that lady 😷
#GOODGOOD
City will win the premier league.\nGet to the UCL finals.\nScore the most European goals.\nCome back after the season to see I'm right😉
as a city fan \n. imo  I think our cbs  are OK but they look a bit shacky at times without Kompany \nI think in the transfer window buy a world class cb to parter Kompany. had a decent back up. if Kompany gets injured  or someone in the defence \n also get sanchez if we can get him on a free transfer .\nI think a great format would be 5 city 3.4.3\nthat's my opinion  \npls don't hate
City the best.
6:32 what's that lady doing?\nBeing racist.\nFire her right now.\nDisrespecting Benjamin Mendy.
I'm a Liverpool fan but I think city are the best team in the world behind Real Madrid
City have to get a result against Chelsea next week
We were far from our best yesterday but still romped home to a 5-0 victory. Good fuckin signs
Well we almost scored, does that count ?
Grande vitória City... Danilo entrou muito bem no jogo e na minha opinião é um dos melhores laterais do mundo... CityBrasil !!!!
cmon city 🔵🔵🔵
Is it possible to have a cam on the other side of the glass in the tunnel?
l
Wait, is that Connor McGregor (Otamendi)? 😂😂😂
EDERSON
Utd are gonna win prem
I liked the old tunnel better.. this has too many stairs and it's a bit narrow
City 5-0 Liverpool \nCity 6-0 Watford \nCity 5-0 Crystal Palace\n16 goals in 3 games the EPL is ours this year
Mendys Hat🙂😀👌

こんにちは
City r probs top 3 teams right now maybe even first.
Nice
Aww, Roy seems like a nice old man. I feel bad for him :(
These videos where we welcome the opposing teams and managers is starting to get creepy. It's starting to look like a horror film. Welcome to the Etihad Mr Hodgson you've always been the caretaker here 60 minutes later 5 goal axe to the chest
Kyle walker and Townsend talking about each other going bald 5:50
Love to see the footballers and managers interact with the children like that.

What is the name of the song at 3:20~3:40??
Crystal palace walking out the tunnel not knowing a 5-0 scoreline is waiting for them on the pitch.
I don't know when or how BUT something tells me you'll crush a bit: I mean have some few indecent results.
Wish United did something like this... The behind the scenes of any major club is fascinating
Sick to see how the Gulf Arabs have bought English football ....
#KDB that pass to Aguero for Sterling goal Dayummmm If Man City keep Sharp and begin to Clinically Finish including half chances they'll continue this #ScoringFeast on Chelsea and everyone else #Sterling how many bloody easy chances do you need before you score?
Look at the man on the left... Look at the top of his head😀 3:11
why aguero always looks like he is forever alone??
Im worried for chelsea man. 5-0 in 2 games. City has some quality signings in arras where wthey were weak last seasons

5:50 Sterling & Walker are talking to Townsend about his hair transplant then Walker shows Townsend that he's going bald loool
2nd
City were far from best despite 5-0
Oh yea Ederson #whataguy\n\nAnd wtf was that lady doing at 6:32
The trophy is ours.
The only reason i come to this channel
Everytime CityTV posts a new video, it feels like a Christmas to me. Thanks a lot!
At 6:32 why did that woman push that kid away from Mendy?
I was there when we had the no doubt win
Pep Is Our Saviour!
City the good
Palace are going down!

What a great performance this was!!! We must come out with intensity against Chelsea from the kick off!!! C'mon City, C'mon City!!! 🔵🔵🔵🔵

Wots all this Manchester City rubbish?    It's a team full of foreign geezers, managed by another foreigner...in a league owned by an Australian....so what's wiv the Manchester city rap?  It's owned by Arab geezers...an Manchester don't come into it at all...anywhere. A much better name fer these geezers would be MECCA CITY.

My propaganda “poster” was roasting the heck out of Napoleon. The reason I chose this is because roasting people, in the current scheme of things, is something that is very commonplace and considered humorous by most. I figured this was a good way to connect to my audience, as Napoleon was a pretty easy guy to flame. Bad hairline, ditched his army like a weak niBBa, made himself an emperor, and too many baguettes, if you know what I mean. The list could go on forever, but I simply wanted to make a video comparing him to images that would make the class laugh. If you want to get technical however, then this video could easily be described as a modern take on what would likely be an anti-Napoleon poster, adapted for a 21st-century audience and created with modern flavor. Please don’t fail me, this actually took longer than you would think. I didn’t eat dinner either. \n But we all know Napoleon, Obama, and Tupac are time and space travelers that dump asexual boy testosterone chemicals in the water. How else do you think we killed off the dinosaurs? They have been doing it for years, but humans have become more used to it at this point. Kids have been eating these chemicals in their afternoon snacks, one of the largest culprits being Tyson Chicken. Although the way i'm describing it seems harmless but it's not. Our generation had been getting mentally weak, “too liberal” if you will. #stopTysonChicken @sentedcruz

Fiesta del independentismo, que bien se lo pasarían toda esta gentuza, fue el Puigdemont, la forcadell y todos estos.
Vale que se dejen ganar por el Barça, pero que se metan los goles ya es demasiado descarado.
Barcelona has no pressure to be a champion. The lack of pressure makes them play like champions. That is all.
The real highlight here is Ter Stegen
Bruhh allow the foreign comments below. DAT SECOND GOAL THOUGH!

El girona es una m*erda de club , con una afición de m*erda,  con una historia  ...pues mas de m*erda todavia ...  que solo el city hará mantenerse en primera bastante$ años . Ojalá  pronto retornen a primera división  equipos históricos como el racing , el recre , el Zaragoza , y  hasta el Valladolid y el Oviedo . Sin contar que les tenga una odio inmenso hacia los dos últimos ...No hace falta mencionar al REAL SPORTING DE GIJÓN , que con 42 campañas en la élite ,15a posición en el ranking histórico y 24.400 abonados en segunda división , sobran las palabras . Yo no puedo hacer que mi equipo este en Europa o gane títulos ...( ni siquiera puedo hacer que se vayan los cerdos que nos han llevado hasta aqui , los Fernández ) eso lo hacen los directivos , el cuerpo técnico y las plantillas ... bueno y el dinero... pero lo que si puede hacer un aficionado como yo , es decir con la cabeza bien alta que estoy orgulloso de formar parte de la mejor , mas fiel y mas INCONDICIONAL aficion de España , la del REAL SPORTING DE GIJÓN . podrian ser honraos y cambiarse el nombre a city b o girona city cagon la virgen ,  aparte de dejar de intentar ensuciar la imagen de mi club , junto otros  clubes m*erda  , insinuando que amañamos partidos cuando estuvimos sin fichar y a punto de desaparecer por inmensas deudas , lógicamente al no saber aceptar que has subido o has descendido de manera consecuente a tus actos , e insinuando también , como no , que el CD LUGO debería haberse dejado ganar para subir vosotros . Nada joder,  que P*TA GIRONA !!!

i can't live without listening this song even a single day.........................
Can't get this song out of my mind
Beautiful.this is all I needed rn 🖤🖤🖤🖤
Feeling like went back in the nineties. And it's a compliment.
i wish i cn dl this song in my phone... I like this song 😭😍😍❤️❤️❤️
I want to cry this song is so beautiful
This song is perfect.
I love the flow of this lyric and music! Perfect for me..
When you were going to dance to this song at hoco with your beautiful girlfriend, but she breaks up with you and now you're left in tears at 1 am...
super song I loved it, would learn and sing for my girlfriend.
1:03 baby okay, but why did I think of baby shark doo doo lol 😂
Listening this with your *the one* is just meant to be.
i love this song very much.....
Thankyou ed for make this song.. Such a perfect song :)
This song is so sweet and simple. Only a man who has gone through real love and hunger can think of such lyrics. And I hope he doesn't release a stupid video to destroy the song.
I just replayed this over and over again because my boyfriend said we should have a special song and he suggest this song. Our conversations always lead to discussing our future together and he's always saying he doesn't deserve me. My heart melts every time I hear the second verse. I had never been in love before and then he came into my life and he's making me feel like every girl in a cliche novel. ❤
who put onion here..\ni'll kick you right in the ass..
It disgusted me when the toothbrushes touched each other 😂
But. But there were no onions in the video 😐 so why am i 😒 nvm
Song is also perfect
my man told me he has fall in love with me since i was 16 & he is 15 that time & i really didn't notice that until i turned 22 & he 21.. i can't believe he still care me as his crush even i didn't even knew.. \n\nI'm glad to be with you & i love you soo much..
Ed this is my favourite song. I love you so much! Come to chile 🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱
Such a beautiful song!!
Just sent this to my GF😂
Beautiful amazing super got to love him so so much
This song reminds me (John legend-All of me) song!!!
I love this song so much (well I love all his songs but this one is by far my favorite)! Its a perfect some for my husband and I! We have known each other since we were 14 & 15 and were best friends until we started dating when we were 17 & 18! We have been together now for 15 years, married 10 and have 2 beautiful children together! This song just expresses our love in a way that I would never be able to do! \n\nThank you Ed Sheeren for writing this touching and romantic song! I hope to see you in concert one day!
Anybody like gosh darn it Ed this is song is so good that I can’t be mad at you for not making a song about me
Who thinks the girl should be Taylor? 😂

Wedding Anthem 2018
I LOVE.  ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
That's the best lyrical video I have ever seen ❤
does this mean theres a music video for this
Get mikey burrows back on this
We always do it the hard way dont we 😂😂
I was screaming that much at the end of that game when the goal went in,  my throat is still hurting
We're on our way, we're on our way to the Premier League we're on our way!🔶🔶
What a game! Great atmosphere too FWAW ▪️🔸▪️🔸
Unbelievable dive from the Barnsley player to con the ref into giving a free kick from which they scored. Good character from Wolves.
As I said to my father (this is our 25th year as Season Ticket holders together) at full time; this is why we love this game. I owe him a lot for my love of football. I will try to pass it on.
These highlights mek our support look like the bluenoses..
can we return van la parra
If we can play poorly ans still manage to get 3 points like yesterday, shows we have the character to be up there with the best.
im a sheffield wednesday fan but wednesday night i will be a wolves fan hoping you can give us somthing to cheer about..all the pigs (blades fans ) have been on radio bragging about how they are the best team in the league and nobody can match them...lets hope you can bring them down to earth with a bang
What a match! I was on the right hand side, the Steve bull bit.
That second wolves goal may be one of the most important this season
97 likes, one dislike.... one lone Brummie looking up from the the deepest mine to see Wolves in the clouds :)
It looked like Coady came from out the South Bank to celebrate the winner.
I was confident enobakare would get going with his goals, two In two, hopefully that boosts his confidence and he can push on from here!
Never screamed so much in my life #COYW
My throats still hurts
Cough cough *1-2 Cardiff* cough cough
Цирк :)
That dive
WAW
Im not a wolves fan . But they won me £300 quid on my acca (Squeaky bum towards the end)  so just for that I hope they make it up to the prem
Get rid of this commentator and get the signal 107 lads back.
Black cabbies go through extensive checks and have to memorize every street in London for their license test. Uber is putting our iconic black cabbies out of pocket. Good riddance.
I mean in reality ubers aren't really the best service anyways considering how there us usually plenty of issues with uber drivers.  Talk about safety by getting into a car with a stranger. that's clearly safe.  that is if it even fcking turns up in the first place after taking cash
Taxi very expensive in London, taxi driver is racists
I know a white English mum that is an Uber driver. It's a good job for a mum.
Mostly Muslim rapes that got there  licence revoked but you won't hear that on the news will you.
pathetic to apologise for what uber have been doing for so long.
There are TWO Londons & Why it MATTERS\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl-DVgHVzgY
I'm more worried about the thousands of people that lost their jobs
Yeah they do not comply to the law ,
People are freaking out? Fuck off. It's called A TAXI? Yunno them black cabs people used before UBER came along. Half of them were rude anyway. Fucking foreign pricks.
Hi please can some people look at my channel
Hey women will get free rides and pleasure in black cabs in London... If you know what I mean
Isn't there any private hires in London?  Ffs most taxis have apps now and did before we had Uber over here
Time to move to the city of England
At least it's better than Coby Persin picking up uber riders in a Bugatti
Probably because the government get more tax from black cabs I'm guessing?
Subscribe to me for an £10 gift card give away
Wanna know why people are complaining?\n\nMost uber drivers shut up and drive
This is all down to Black Cab Drivers unable to deal with competition.  Black Cab Drivers have just lost the little credibility they were clinging on to.

Wow this is stupid, the dramatic music and everything smh it's Uber ffs just get a fucking cab with your first world issues, dickhead.
Uber is a bad company
There's many other minicab offices that will benefit from this
Search Youtube for Arcade City.  Just saying.
On another note I have tried to take many forms of transport in London and because I'm a panda they won't take me, so I just gallop, like a horse, so I won't look too suspicious.

Uber is not the only taxi app available lyft , Addison Lee ,hailo and many more .
Thank fuck Über has lost it . Most of there driver are dirty smelly pedo Muslim. 👍🏼👍🏼 \nLove live the British London black cab driver 👍🏼🇬🇧👍🏼🇬🇧
Fuck uber I'd rather get raped on the bus
These drivers can work for their local cab company, so most jobs aren't lost. Customers can use other app to get taxis such as Kabbie to get a cab for a reasonable price.
It's about time!! I was a taxi driver. You either sign up and be an uber driver or lose out ... uber will put every taxi firm out of business and as a company they should have made certain changes to keep people safe and haven't. I hope they lose the right to do business in every town and city in the UK
They need to employ some female sexual predators other wise there just being sexist , or maybe just top less ones , just start a new company called Boober I'd be there biggest customer
Didn't Londoners vote for labour control. It's just the labour way.
I've never used Uber- I'm 19 and much prefer traditional cabs. Same prices so...
Drunk students will be stranded I guess
If you're a student and you can afford a taxi period there's something wrong there
Hahaha long live the black cabs. Fuck you uber
Just take the bus.
Guys it's easy just use Wallington cars and couriers. They are actually a really good service
Britain is a failing country, the government basically own you.
Can we all just stfu about politics and get on? In real life you don't bite each other's heads of!
Uber is getting its arse kicked about time
Great news uber sneaking about not paying taxes all though the back door get a proper black cab
Who else is just relaxed knowing there not in London right now? 😥🙏
OMG GOD how are people going to get around now\n\n\n\n\nbecause humans never moved until Uber was made
Losing Uber is great news for London. Black Cabs are an institution and something we should all be proud of.
jesus christ people just get a car or bike if you can't afford it.
Good. The knowledge beats all.
Please help a brother reach 50 subs!
Uber hasn't paid any tax whilst operating in the U.K. What so ever! And they're being taken of the streets as they're a risk to health and safety after a growing number of rapes and sexual assaults, get a black cab, they're a lot safer, professional and English, black taxi prices are higher but that extra 3 quid ensures your safety around London
Just walk kids, it ain’t that far a few miles in 45 mins to save £30 by not taking a cab is ez
I love uber. This is absolute nonsense
i see the cancer is thriving in the comments
Its an APP? Why don't they just copy it & make it state run? Put all profits towards fixing the roads etc. Screw Uber's mega rich shareholders.
*Hey you! I have been working on my channel for almost 3 years now and i was wondering if maybe you could check out some of my videos, let me know how im doing, how far ive come etc*
Good when uber drivers trying to kill our police out side Buckingham palace. Rapes extortion etc.
Don't really care about the passengers, but think of all the people in london that have lost their jobs.
I watched TAXI Driver sat in the back of a TAXI whilst eating a TAXI bar once. Whilst a plane TAXIed on a nearby runway. All this typing is quite TAXIng
Uber drivers are not necessary in London due to excellent public transport.
Capitalism at its finest right here... oh wait
Wtf man uber has served me well all this time.. give back its license for fuck sake..
Pretty sure London was one of the only places in the U.K. Where you could use über. I live in Plymouth and know one uses it so either learn how to fucking drive or get a taxi lie everyone else
BUT I CAN STILL USE MY UBER APP
London is my country.
Yay!
Haha they are fucked
One word lyft
About fucking time

Hi
https://youtu.be/NfVcATLVGSI
Shouldn't let rapists and pedophiles work for Uber most of them can't even speak English
So they should be banned.  Cheap ass service.  The drivers don't have the knowledge or passion for the position.  It's a vocation if you do it right.  Half of uber drivers can barely speak English so fuck em.  Go get a job at mc d's.  The drivers aren't qualified in nvq or neither do they have regular crb checks or medicals such as a drugs test.   Cheap ass service for cheap ass people.
SIGN THIS ONLINE PETITION TO SAVE OUR UBERS \nhttps://www.change.org/p/save-your-uber-in-london-saveyouruber\n\n\nLIKE THIS SO THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE SEE IT
To that retards last comment if you want to be safe move out of London living costs are cheaper and crime is lower its not the government's responsibility to make sure your safe everything you decide to go out and piss yourself so badly you can't walk at 3 in the morning grow up
London isn't London anymore its owned by foreign aliens
Now the Islamic state of london will have to ride their goats to the mosk instead
*This is why UK is trash. Theyre always so against capitalism and the free market. Reason why those Americans have made far more advancements than us fucking foreigners. These black cabs need to realize that we are in the modern age. Their jobs shouldnt last forever without any form of change or competition. Entrepreneurs are constantly creating things that will challenge somthing that has been so instilled in our lives that sooner or later, people just have to accept that fact that we must evolve and allow things to take its natural course.   You cant stop technology from further entering and changing our lives.*
lets all agree if your an indian live in india or if your a pakistani live in pakistan or a African live in africa or if your any think else fuck off to America
BLAME THE MUSLIMS THEY ARE TAKING KVER THE WORLD..!! Sadiq Khan mayor

AWAY WITH YOU!!!, needs to be on a shirt with the tractor cannon
This weapon is so fun to use!! I hope everyone gets it cuz it will make things fun as hell in crucible now days lol
That song sounds like a remix of the Star Wars Cantina Theme. Anyways, the tractor cannon is the perfect troll weapon for the Fun Police. I love what you do. Keep it up.

The salt is real at the end. Laugh so hard!
Sheikh you we're my inspiration to turn into a bubble titan in D1, and proud sentinel on D2!
Defender is really good code of the protector for pvp
I hope Bungie adds more guns like the Tractor gun in future DLC's. I mean, guns that don't just shoot bullets, but actually do a thing
Best videos I’ve ever seen on YouTube been watching since the chaperone release been a wonderful time
Definitely time for a Trials of Cold Heart

For one last time people make some noise for Chester!
It's amazing to see how well these songs meld together when they were created completely seperate from each other. I miss Chester ):
listening to Linkin Park always gives me goosebumps then I'll start to have watery eyes 😭😭😭
NOW WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU WAITING FOOORRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nostalgy is beating harder than a comet on earth, geat tribute <3 RIP Chester
I´VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS. THANKS, JAY Z <3
I really lost it when chester started singing... 😢😢😢
This guy is the real GOAT
Wow the future Cher ad is so cringey\n\nEdit: this video is good.
mad respect Jay-z. Chester love u always bro
Brings me back to 2004
Respect to jay z for paying homage to the late great chester wish he was still here i miss him dearly he helps me so much shame we had to lose a legendary soul this year he was so young only 41
got chills...thx for this J!
These songs were good days
While walking in your shoes...
This is my childhood. And it’s a masterpiece
Thanks Jay. We needed this. Much respect felt in this.
That good old days :')
I just love how he looks up to the sky like thinking This is for you, my friend.
This feels unreal. Why does it feel unreal.😢😢😢😢😢 miss you Chester Rock In Peace
Great tribute, huge respect for JAY Z that he decide to this and show his respect to one of the world's greatest singers.
I think this is the realest I've seen jayz feel in my 29 years on this Earth ,  you can see and feel how alone he feels performing without chester in this song , and now it's means so much more than it did when first written
R E S P E C T✨👌
Nah i like more the versión of Will Smith on 2009.
Respect to Jay Z for doing this
uffff I feel the biggest hole
This is what we call tribute. Thanks Jaz Z for an awesome tribute... Missing u chester.
Don't know whether other people noticed...he seems to be standing off to one side, like he is leaving space for where Chester should be.
That moment before JayZ says Chester and tips his hat down, it really seems like he doesn't want to start tearing up..
WHY THE FEELS JUST CAME BACK
Damn that rap is still back and thanks for Jay-Z for supporting Linkin Park.
What the hell are you waiting for? For the numbness that I now feel for more than 2 months to go and you to come back here were you belong D;
You rock Jay-Z, thank you so much for tribute to one of the greatest man and a legendary rock man on earth, Chester Bennington.\n#CHESTERFOREVER

What an awkward thing. You meet Ronaldo and you basically sellout on the fragrance and show him things out on your phone.
Should be happy as meeting a great player of all time congrats mate

God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk

im also left handed but i wear my watch on the left hand
I purchased a couple cases already for the 8 Plus , that will show up in a week. Coming from a 6 its probably a big improvement. Although I do try to only buy clear cases with simple designs. No use going through all the trouble of picking out a certain color phone if your just going to cover it up anyway.
Love you!!!!
*Look wise they changed nothing.*
you trendy bitch!
Hi
YouTube cancer
Lovin it👍🏽💖🙌🏽✌️🏽
M'lady, you radiate pure beauty **tips fedora**
I love your glasses!
Yay some blond screaming about stupid phone, disliked
Love ur spec look ... sexy mama
I bet you have nice vag.
God damn. Every time something big comes out in tech I have to be recommended this chick.
Yea but guess what your messages are green not blue!! 😂😂😂
I'm also left handed
I like that u like it but iPhone really sucks now a day
are you getting the iPhone 10
Left hand squad!  Where you at!!! 🙋🙋🙋🙋☺☺☺
Iphone 8 is different to the Iphone 7 because... um... 8 is higher than 7.\nNow give us you money.
She looks so cute with those glasses 😍😍
What a joke iphone 8 is as bad as this airheads videos stupid bitch
Does the apple watch conects to the iphone 6??
who actually likes this shit it's Apple's awful, overpriced products and here she is brainwashing everyone with her stupidity. and all her brain dead fans commenting down here gtfo
Can you review the new colors introduced? The rose red and olive green?
Justine, put one mat in one room and another in another. Ex: Mophie in your room and the other in the kitchen.
Any small youtubers wanna support each other (say 8 if subbed to me ) I will sub back :-)
yes! perfect apple watch 3 =) luv it.  what do you think about the lumiy lightblade lamp?  love the light and the charging port... better than buying a dock?
Does the iPhone 8 come with the charger?
the black wireless charger sort of look like a coaster
LOL my s5 has too wireless charging and now after 3 years iphone has plus the phone is just like the same just with wireless charging and another number and big price. I just had to change my case to my s5 to have wireless charging without using my phone. Back then the first iphone was like 500$. Yep you heard it 500 and now the price is going higher and higher.
I phone operated by idiots. It is similar to buying a 2 year old samsung.
Most things on iphones we're made by Samsung and burrowed from android
I got the iPhone 8 gold the day it came out I’m so happy
Why not Iphone 10 like everyone else has?? What-are you busted out broke or something?  Guess being YouTube tool doesn't pay what we thought.
You can so good spell English. Ok you're English 😂😂I'm german and i can a little bit English speak. OMG it's 20:59 OK I wount sleep but I have 6:00 school. OK good night 🌃😴
Yeah, but guess what?  Your messages are green... NOT BLUE!  That was great. 😂😂😂
What I film this days ago ? God complicated
Nice glasses! 🕶️🤓
You already have a 42 so might as well get 38 and switch it up. I have small wrists and love 38
I subscribed before 10 seconds into the video.
This bitch will buy anything Apple related and not understand she's getting ripped off
You are the best💜💜💜
Girls should wear watches on their right wrist and men should wear watches on their left wrist. This is known over millennium
feels like I had this experience back in 2012, and even back then I was late to the party

ofz2cHLkiRI,

ofz2cHLkiRI,at least now I will be able to drop my phone in someone else's pad at their house, I think
What a scam i though it was a iphone 8 unboxing

She's rich
Samsung wins
5:35 ROASTEDDDDDDD
03:00 MILEY
HEY GUYS! WE ARE SUBSCRIBING TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT SUBSCRIBES TO US UNTIL WE HIT 150 SUBS!! TELL ME WHEN YOU’VE DONE IT!!!
If Steve Jobs Were still alive he would’ve had wireless charging before Samsung!!! Shit he would’ve made the iPhone 5 a wireless charger m had a glass\nBack like the iPhone 4/4s
U sellout
5:26, haha.
Hi Justine! At the Apple Event, they show us a multiple wireless charger, where we can put the iPhone, the Watch and the Airpods. When does comes? Do you know?
No more Samsung for me🤔
My dad works at apple and I got the iPhone X
It's a very big pad ... 😂
Justine can u at least use a pocket socket?? - Mimi Van Thanks! :D
You should giveaway some of your old apple stuffs so you will gain more subscribers...
that's not an iphone 8 plus case, its an iphone 7 plus case, on the 8 the dual cameras are vertical...
I'm a leftie but I keep my watch on my left hand and it's so dirty..
Android green messeges vs. iphone blue messeges........ this shit makes me angry.. girl you can change the fing color of the messeges on android... which you cannot do on ios... Its time to stop being so stupidly excited for apple products because they are getting less and less innovative every fking year its just plain stupid... Its time to switchhh ;)
lmfao 😂 android phones had these for a long time already and when i saw this video, i was like LOL
Can you do a giveaway for  the iPhone 8
She has a bedtime??
“but guess what, ur messages are green and not blue!” 😂😂😂
*It must be fantastic to be able to rake in millions of subs based off of teenagers wanting to cum on your face.*
mugs like this woman are the reason apple are making money for so little changes and innovation
Apple is brain washing every1 with that iPhone 8.  Basically a 7 with a glass back...\n\n\n\nIPhone X is okay.\n\nS8 does everything the X does, AND I STILL HAVE A HEADPHONE JACK!\n\n\nPlus in case u were wondering s8 has a higher resolution than the X\n\n\nIn fact, its a WQHD + 2960x1440 SUPER OMOLED Infinity screen.     Curved screen.  Glass back. Camera doesn't stick out....\n\n\nThe 3 things Iphone X does better is records at 4K 60f.  S8 is 4k at 30F.      But the 60f does a great difference.\n\nAnd X has 3D facial recognition, while s8 has it too but can be unlocked with a random pic of ur face.   :/    unless ur friends carry a life size pick of ur face everywhere,,,,,BUT u can turn this feature off, so ur safe...\n\n\n3rd is face emoji, but why do we need That? \n\nS8 still has Finger scan I.D\nIPhone X DOES NOT.  \n\n\nI mean ask urself this question....what r u doing on a iPhone that a s8 can't already do?\nIf u use insta, snap, YouTube, than why not get the s8???\n\ncost less and looks really really nice.
but guess what? Your messages are GREEN. NOT blue!\n\n\nI ugly giggled. Thank you Justine. Lol
You can flip the ui for left handed people
“Your messages are green, not blue.” My thoughts exactly.
I think you look pretty cool with glasses. You're cool either way; just a different look.
Ughhh when we thought the iphone 6+ was new... And the iphone 7.. now im behind and people will think my phones old 📱😂
PLEASE REVIEW THE NEW SPORT LOOP APPLE WATCH BAND!!!!!!!!!
Well your messages are green NOT BLUE!! I literally live for your quotes ❤️😍
Your eyes are too far apart lmaooo
R u getting iPhone x which would u recommend iPhone 8 or x
You're so. Annoying with your bought ads... Pathetic.
Justine, you forgot that when you take your iPhone on a plane all you have to do is put it on airplane mode not remove the battery for everyone’s safety.
Finally saying goodbye to my iPhone 5! It’s been real ✌🏼✌🏼✌🏼✌🏼😁
I hopped on a plane at LAX\nWith my Switch and my Cardigan.
i always confuse her for being transgender
The iPhone 8 and iPhone 7 r literally like the same thing
You would buy you loser the iPhone
I like the white wireless charger more
that time you buy a samsung qi charger for your iphone......\n\nedit: you want the heavier one so it slides less.
This women symbolises so much of whats wrong with the world
I’m left handed
I found it so funny how she worried about how the watch looked on her and how hard of a choice it was when there’s people that can’t even afford food, ily Justine😭😭😭
Your messages are green NOT BLUE.  , I'm dead 😂
Hey, everyone! I'm Liam, the creator of this video. I've been working on this one for a heck of a long time. I hope you all enjoy it. Special thanks to Julian Eggebrecht, the founder of Factor 5, Inc. for letting us share footage of WeFly for the first time. If anyone has any questions about the video, please let me know.
Release the prototype iso online Factor 5, please. Thumbs up if you agree.
As a developer, these are the saddest damn things to watch
Man, what a shame. I'd have loved WeFly.
This makes me really sad. I absolutely love Pilotwings, and this looks like it could have been the best one. RIP
Oh man, this would have been one heck of a Pilotwings game. I would have loved it for sure, as I already loved going into Birdman mode on the Little States Island and going to the miniature real-world locales. Getting a full global version of that was something I've always wanted. So sad that something like this never came into fruition.
That glasses thing looks COOL, It's probably be a pain to set up, though.
Were the factor 5 developers drinking beer while working, or am I seeing things?
I really hope some of the ex Factor 5 guys leak some of these projects some day.
Bummer! That sounds like it could have been a cool game. Scratching the same itch as Endless Ocean, I suppose.
Damn... That head tracking tech could've made for some good First-Person games.
We Fly's cancellation is honestly one of the more heartwrenching examples of a game being cancelled, in that it seems the developers really put their hearts into making it.
This guy has an American /English accent.
This is... so sad T_T
Interesting... And very impressive graphics.

Damn i feel for Factor 5....would have loved a new Pilotwings game the 64 one was one of the most relaxing games I've ever played
now that was a sad story
that head tracking bit was so cool. if i had the talent i'd try my hand at something similar.
Really wish this, and the completed but unreleased Rogue Squadron collection could be released someday...
Did you know? I keep pushing people away, but am really terrified of dying alone.
if they just made a Star Fox game where you fly by holding the wii mote - and fire using - you know - the buttons - it would have been the greatest game on the Wii - there was a mini game in one of those wario ware games where you did that - it was perfection
Rogue Squadron was so good. Factor 5 would have made an amazing Wii game. The name “WeFly” screams shovelware, but it looked VERY promising especially with the level of detail added for the time.
how...how did i not ever heard about that version of VR? that version seems MUCH more simplified and severely less costly to produce. that looked really cool.
If the former staff were bought by sony and asking them make their pilot wings version for the VR. \n\nIt could be possible, but its only a dream I can only say
Best game for wii sports resort
That would have been amazing! \n\nExcellent video!
5:28 Holy depth imagine one of those old star wars rebel assault games with a wiimote while on the shooting gallery part of the games and add in where you have to bob your head around to get a good angle on stormtroopers to shoot at and dodge by swaying your body hard to the sides. That would be more 3d then any 3d movie I've ever seen.
So in a sense Nintendo thrown away ther own version of face tracking 3d vr before anyone else had it great job missing that patent guys
This pisses me off. Poor Factor 5. I loved them. Imagine if they were still making games today on current platforms.
Holy fucking shit, WeFlight looked REALLY impressive, especially with the glasses and how they tried to replicate the actual weather and timezones of the real world. It legitimately makes me sad that Factor 5 got bankrupt, this seemed like it'd be a really fun game and I'd love if it got released.
😔I wish this game existed
It's like every other game featured here had a connection to Factor 5 in someway. It's almost as if they're bad luck
Fuck, this game looks like it would've been awesome. So sad they had to close down. :(
They should leak the roms for us to emulate
Im sad that wefly/wiifly failed,it could have been awesome to fly around london or tokyo,i feel like it could have online with other people
Ah, my dream Wii game! We almost had it. Maybe it can still happen someday....
It's disappointing that this game managed to get off the ground and really take off, but, it was not capable of sticking the landing.
By then Nintendo president; Satoru Iwata\nThat line, and how casually it was said... I gotta say it punched right in the feels. I miss that dude.
This game looks awesome! It's a shame that it had to be cancelled though. :/
UGH, THIS WOULD'VE WON AWARDS!
Man, I wish Factor 5 was able to release this game
at this point with most involved companies bankrupt\nwhy not accidentally leak the unfinished game to the internet\nso others can enjoy the game that had so much love and care put into it
The game looks great and all, but those glasses would've been amazing
Such a shame that this never made it to console. It would of been an amazing and unique experience.
This video just makes me sad. I would have LOVED this game. It looks so chill and relaxing.
GOD DAMNIT! That game sounds so damn promising! I would've totally LOVED to play that!
Don't understand why they didn't just make Pilotwings Wii under Nintendo's publishing and supervision.
That moment when a GOOD channel is on trending. Feels great man.
Looks so dank, wish I had this as a kid whould have been my jam.
If only Factor 5 hadn't been killed by the PS3 disaster that is Lair, we'd have had a great return of Pilotwings. -_-
I hope WeFly gets leaked one day, it looks like the proper pilot wings sequel I've been wanting.\nVery impressive looking to, sad it couldn't be released it would have been a quick purchase for me.
We need to dig the game's assets up from the Former Factor5 Management, repackage it, and make it a reality. Anyone up for the search?\n\n#WeFlyRecoveryMission
Can't wait for the day when it eventually gets leaked online
I'd love to have played it.
What a depressing story... Can't believe no publisher bailed out Factor 5, they were such a talented studio, and yet so many shitty games came out on Wii and even made money. Please make the next Unseen 64 about a crap cancelled game that didn't deserve to come out to cheer me up, or I'll be sad about this until the next Pilotwings comes out, which will probably be forever.
I feel like this is the game that would've actually gotten me to play the Wii. Then again, I would've bought this just because Factor 5's name was on it.
Wow. Looks and sounds likes a revolutionary Wii game for its time. Too bad Factor 5 went bankrupt.
Now with Pilotwings having gone on hiatus again for over half a decade (geez I'm having one of those it's really been that long? moments remembering Pilotwings Resort was a 3DS launch title back in 2011) I think now would be a nice time to revisit the series. A game like that seems like a nice fit for the Switch since you can do quick play sessions anywhere you want, and the increased power of the system compared to something like the 3DS could mean more and larger levels, and maybe even new vehicles if they can find a fun way to implement them. I guess the big question is if it'd still mainly use Miis like Resort did or if it'd go back to characters designed by the dev team like Pilotwings 64 (if it does this would be a cool way to bring back Nester given he was in PW64).
[sees headset idea]\nWow that's really dumb.\n[sees headset in use]\nWOW THAT'S AWESOME.\n\nMan, I am SO BUMMED that this was never finished. The only thing I ever did in Pilotwings 64 was explore the island and find all of its secrets while more or less ignoring the actual missions, so WeFly would have been RIGHT up my alley. And the weather channel integration was just such a cool idea!
Factor 5, forever caught in Nintendo's friend zone
Dam this sounds like it would have been good
We need this on the Switch
Xbox, a console of a larger installed base... Sorry, but... no. At the end of the generation the Xbox barely had sold just 3 million more than the GameCube, and I'm sure at time Lucas Arts were putting pressure on Factor 5, the two console had pretty much the same installed. They must have wanted the Star Wars to be ported to Xbox, but not because of a larger installed base that it clearly didn't have, but probably because the PS2 couldn't run those game without some serious downgrade and optimization. So the Xbox was their best option for a port, since it could do direct port without much work.
Fuck, wasn't Factor 5 allowed to finish a single game?
What a sad story... To think that a potentially awesome game, and pseudo VR would just disappear thanks to 2008. Those infrared glasses were freakin' genius, I still want those! If they revive this game and add the infrared glasses to the switch i will die a happy man.
I want this on Switch.
Man, that WeFly would have been fantastic!! N should have brought those people on board to complete it..
This is a *huge* pisser, to me. I know about some of Factor 5's other rejected projects, such as their original 8-player _Mega Bomberman_ demo.. but, the fact that a series of events prevented one of my _favorite_ childhood games from getting another entry just burns my hide.  It was a shame...
gauntlet!!!!? Please 🙏 do gauntlet!!!! Like if you agree
wtb> beta leak
Ninoooooooooo
Switchfly
That game looks incredible
Pilotwiings
Turn on captions at 2:16 😂😂😂
Fuckthefive?!
Liam sure does love talking about Fucktor 5
Thats sad
Huh, neat
So much potential!
Yet again fucked her 5
I am sorry fucktive five
2:18 xbox porn!?!?!?
5:50 lol game devs get lit
http://past.is/aijjs
fuck the five
omg :'(
Quick, name every Unseen64 video that doesn't involve Factor 5!\n\nI'll start:
Did I hear Fuck the Five?
Next time on the Factor 5 show...
Unfortunate Nintendo didn't want this game to exist. I see why, but it would have been an amazing title.
Where was the part about pilotwings?
What is the music used in this video's name
Sounds like a very boring Pilotwings. I want a Nintendo 64 Pilotwings reboot made by Namco maybe ? based on Ace Combat 7 graphics Engine 800 P 40 fps would be fine
fuck now i want that game  seriously ubisoft instead of doing stupid sport games or racing why not give us a fligh arcade
Damn this looked like it could have been a killer title for the Wii to really pump some life back into it mid life cycle, however if Factor5 had used data from the Wii's weather channel it would have always been 6 hours old, and I never did get an accurate weather forecast from it the whole time it was active.
what language is the narrator speaking?
Liam, please work on your pronunciation on port. Or don't. It's kinda funny imagining xbox porn of the Rogue Squadron game
Shi-. I remember seeing that Wii Remote head tracking demo video back then! I'm so disappointed that couldn't be brought to market.
Billie just tweeted this omfg
Billie u're responsible on y im here
nut
Im proud of u malone
Billie Joe sent me here!
Holy fuck
I don’t like this... it’s not good sorry... I love Green Day
I love Green Day
So Post Malone is Green Day fan? cool
Lots of respect for Post, chill dude who has an appreciation for rock and metal 🤘
Post really should feel like a rockstar because he is one
One of my favorite rappers singing my favorite band's music. Cool
❤
Billie Joe sent me here!
I was very skeptical upon entering into this... I actually really enjoyed this lol
THIS IS SO GOOD
Great job post malone
Squad
0:55 i checked steam lol
Greeeen dayyyyyy
Billie sent me!
Brilliant come back to Scotland pleaseeeeee
5th
omg this so bad. I'll stick to the Green Day Version.
I like Post, even if I don't like his music that much, he's got a nice attitude about him
Honestly, respect to him for making the Cover his own.\n\nA Cover isn't supposed to be a Carbon Copy of the original, that's what a Tribute is for.\n\nHe performed the Song in his own way, and I think he did a pretty damn good job at it.
Sucks
Jak Paul disliked this 8 times
She put this on Spotify and Soundcloud but thats for music...
I love these songs <3
I can't even hate, girl has BARS
I am not gonna  lie she is got bars
I'm 14, I'm not aloud to say piss that often,  MEANWHILE THIS 14 YEAR OLD GIRL IS SWEARING AND TALKING ABOUT CRAP.
This has got a good beat!!
Ronny J can make anyone sound good holy shit
This is lil pump if he was a girl
Ok but why does this actually slap
I think this girl is proof that rap culture is not only destroying society but also dumbing down the masses.
Danielle Bregoli releases only bangers, that's a fact.\n\nBut also, she licks her lips an awful lot.
i was a hater now she turned me into a fan
when she says Hi bitch she is pulling The Praise sign And looking up ?
OMFG this song is sooooooo good! I remember hearing this song when i was like 5 so happy to see it blow up! Like if ur still watching in 2018
This is a little girl so truthfully what can she possibly know about it lol she's got something going but she's still a baby
I'm no americano but this is just a question: why do controversialpeople like danielle who disrespect her mom a lot gets more views than real singers like hanson or haim with no  controversies can be heard
I can list 4 female rappers around her age better  than her : \n1 Molly Brazy \n2 Rocky B\n3 Cuban da savage \n4 Asian Doll
I hate  that I love this♡♡♡♡♡♡
IT'S THE QUEEN
this flow sound like 21 savage in a way.. except she actually has emotion in her voice instead of sounding like she just woke up, damn.
I ain't gonna lie, she is good. This song is going to be in me favourite list xD
I will punch someone in the face if I hear this around me.
She wants to be lil pump soooo bad
Is this Run the Jewels Nobody Speak? Lol literally stole their music video
 I be like send me the addy, hop out the Porsche wit a bhaddie, got a nice  face and a fattie,, do what I say like I'm daddy I loveeeee this verse😍😍😍 you bad asffff😍
Just who old is she
People say she don’t deserve this fame, and they be talking all this shit on her comment section and shit. She got famous because of you! You’re clicking on this video! You’re using her catch phrase. It’s a pretty done deal. If she doesn’t deserve this fame, then why did you make her so famous?
HALF OF THE LYRICS IS JUST DANIEL SAYING hi bich I KID YOU NOT
Song makes my Porsche crash me
Pure shit but I’m obssesed with it
I want her hair v.v
I give this girl about a year or 2 before no one knows her name. Literally the whole some said the exact same thing and every verse was repetitive if not said the something just in different words lol
She reminds me of Rufus from Kim Possible (I hope she sees this)
Girllll you did hella good this is my favorite song forever and ever your soooo good at rapping
Oooo she's a babe💕
Stop doing these songs your ruining the industry bich

I can't lie there are things appealing about the song but I gotta say the vocal fry in her voice is hard to get over and I can't really understand what the song is about really but in a way it is catchy but much like iggy azalea but I feel weird cuz she's 14
*What was your favourite of these 10 amazing goals? Let me know in the comments!*\nFollow me on *Facebook* where I post my old videos that have disappeared from YouTube! https://www.facebook.com/LilWizProductions
The Giroud goal has to win it for me.
I'm just imagining internet going full troll and the trophy going to 2:49 chick goal
Where is Emre Can's overhead?
Why there is Matic goal? Great goal but not special.
Definitely the gk scoring double kick at the end of the game
Mate, you don't know how to make a bad football video, I love the emphasis on the commentary.
boateng or the goalkeepers is the best
swear that chilliean teamis always scoring long rangers.They at high altitude or something?
Can't choose between Giroud and Mandzukic. Both streets ahead of the others.
Fucking hate commentators that just scream goal over and over load as fuck or just say it once but scream it out for ages, lazy fucking commentary, glad we don't have that shit in England, it would put me off watching football if I heard that every game.
Giroud all the way, he even started the entire chance from half way down the pitch with a good tackle. The Baroka FC's goalkeeper goal deserves it too.
A goalkeeper scoring a bicycle kick in the last minute has to win. No contest.

Wow. Last year Subri's free kick was the clear winner, but this year for me there's no obvious winner. I could see the Camargo, Boateng, Mandzukic, Giroud, or the South African goalkeeper's goal winning it. They're all amazing, although Matic's goal is a little out of place. I would guess most people are going to vote for the Mandzukic goal because of the time and place, but I'd vote for the goalkeeper just because holy frak he's a goalkeeper.
How old is Kevin Prince Boateng now? Gotta be 30.. He's still such an athlete, feels like hes been around forever.
Giroud and Masaluke.  Amazing goals this year, though.
gotta love that volleying back a goal kick from your own half
Had to turn it off due to the shit forign commentators.
Man these girls just love FootBall \nHERE http://bit.ly/2wbJphB
Can i watch the first goal 7 times more please?? holy shit
Did not know 16 year old girls could kick that far
Has to be giroud! The counter attack, the back heel in the build up, the SCORPION 🦂
Jesus you didn't need to show the goals 15 times
Is this over the top shouting goal for as long as possible commentating supposed to be funny or something? Just seems incredibly obnoxious to me...glad we dont have that in the prem
For me It has to be giroud
I'm only one goal in but wow...
hurtado goal was beyond fucked what the hell
Matic
That U19 Dortmund 27 player got dullied mate
Aviles hurtado👍
Wtf that girl amazing stunning the goalkeeper
Dembele
celtics goal was incredible.. but fifa never usually include team goals.. E.g Arsenal vs nowrich
Amazing so much choices
How many times you gotta relay the same goal :/:/:/
Steven Gerrard has won this one for me
Boateng's is the best, but I want to see Dembele win 💚
Has to be Giroud before you even look at the other nominees, he deserves it too. Cant see him winning it though after Aaron Ramsey was robbed with his galatasaray goal. Fifa is corrupt so it probably comes down to the highest bidder!
Would help if it showed the full Dembele goal. Every player touched the ball including the goalkeeper there was at least 30 seconds of build up play missing.
Guys do you think so hit like if girouds goal was better and dislike if mkhitaryan's was better
It's gotta be Mandzukic, but so many wonderful goals. Thanks for the compilation!
I don't mean to be that guy but wtf no Emre can over head kick? Like I get they have to go for equality but in comparison the woman's goal is crap the matric goal looks ordinary like seriously wtf
29 replays later
Oscarine Masuluke,for one reason. He is a goalkeeper.....
Either boateng or mandzukic for me
Giroud's goal is the best but Fifa will never give it to him cos the bumlick La liga.
if you change Mandzukic goal's commentary to Tony Jones...
may be you can add those two goals to the best goals of septembre : \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUfOz3XeWeo\nClub : Raja Casablanca\nthe assist of both goals : Abdelilah Hafidi \nthe striker of both goals : Mahmoud Benhalib
Moussa Dembélé FTW
how the fuck is there no messi goal??
That's a dislike
maticcc
Any more replays?
Why is Mkhitaryan not nominated
Reported
Stop playing each clip for like 1 30 faggot
ya let's just uhhhh put raw meat on a kids face
jack do it right you FUCK
Gordon Ramsey the type of man to leave his entire family for a touch of oil.
Gordon: but make sure to tell her where you got the recipe from. Don't want you to steal daddy's thunder\nClassic Gordon ^^
OH-MY-GOD! LOOKS GREAT! I do have to say, I REALLY enjoy these videos, and the ones with his children really seem to make them that much better. Oh, Jack, you just dribbled on your jumper. Great Job and Keep 'em Coming!
IT'S RAW YOU CHEEKY LITTLE TWAT
This comment section is pure gold. It's Fucking niice
1:08\n\nSo how'd you cook these at *OUR* restaurants if they take so long?\n\nJack Ramsay establishing dominance early on.
6,16 :)))) i don't know!!! u go son :)
Mm yes touch raw meat and then touch your son's face. Contamination!
The fact that Jack is so young just proves how old this video actually is... just posted recently... SAD
That kid's girlfriend is gonna give him sum good pussy if he cooks that delicious shit for her.
At 4:30 camera guy drops camera for a bit
It's so cool to see Gordon teaching his kids so early. They're going to be so skilled once they're at his age.
Don't forget to lightly drizzle your tongue with olive oil before eating your food
Maybe you'll make this for your girlfriend one day? Son: mmhhh.... no.. I like penis
I swear, this guy uses up like half of the worlds olive oil supply.
Gordon: perhaps you'll cook this for your girlfriend one day\n\nJack: *Im gay...*
He puts olive oil on almost everything 😓
Did I just see you use can tomato sauce!!!! #Triggeredlol
Where's the lamb sauce?!
Beef cheeks, get the fuck out of the kitchen
Gordon: what you watching son\nSon: WWE\nGordon: is it smack down \nSon: no it’s RAW\nGordon: fuck me
Now this makes me hungry
The kid: so I put these raw beef cheeks in the pot\nGordon: ITS FUCKING RAW YOU CUNTY ASS FUCKER!!!!!1!!!111!!!!!!
father and son goals
This is my favourite video because he's teaching a kid but he's happy not shouting :)
Gordon - Youll make this for your girlfriend one day\n\n\n\n\nJack - But I'm Gay
Gordon you're killing me, your food is so gooooooooooooood
What if he says fuck me in front of the kid
His kids know so many things about cooking and im here cant make cereal
I bet Gordan pores olive oil on his pancakes in the morning
This guy looks like he has a knack with food, he should open a restaurant or be on TV or something.
Your sisters are gonna love you even more now      some incest shit going on
Videos like this make me want to become a chef.
Is salt and pepper the only seasoning in his cupboard lol
Just came here to see if people made jokes about cheeks
What are the white things at 4:30 ??
he just puts salt, pepper, and olive oil on everything...
His boy should know more about food, perhaps they dumb him down for the show.
What liquid did he add to jam???
After seeing this episode with Jack his son we can see who Gordo truly favors in the Ramsay dynasty...I've never seen him smile so much and be so loving with the girls...I mean I am sure he loves all his children without a doubt...but Jack....oh man he was grabbing cheeks all episode and laughing and smiling...unfortunately I don't think Jack likes to cook as much as Halls or Meagan so it will be interesting to see who is appointed successor to the crown here...
2:01 they're like little shit sausages floating in the sunday morning diarrhea
Gordon I'll give your meat a bit of love dad
Gordon: what about when you cook this for your girlfriend one day? \nJack: Uhh...
That beef is raw! Is that pasta frozen? Did you microwave it?!\nYou should've used lamb sauce. This plate is a mess. NINO!!!!
Always enjoy when you cook with your family …Thank you Chef
Salt n Pepa. Butta Get your pans really nice and hot. Red wine chocolate souce let the knife do the work
you can cook this for your girlfriend\n“uhhh”\n#ramsgay2025
He is a really great father wish i had a father like him
Me: This looks so fun and good. I want to make this myself one day.\n\nAlso me: 🏠 🔥
Where are the Indian cow worshippers at??? 😂😂\nYour god is being eaten by the British people...😂😂
Gordon: I have some bad news son....you're adopted.\n\nJack: Nice
Don't be cheeky
little drizol, of olival
I wanna eat something im starving!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Your sisters are going to love you even more now...\nDafuq?
Instead of looking like crocodile heads, they looked like what I left in my toilet this morNin
At the end, the casual pun : dont be cheeky.. 😂😂😂
Honestly who cooks this stuff? I only come here to see Gordon cooking and teasing his children
Your sister is going to love you even more ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) - Gordo Ramsi 2K17
I want to die and reincarnate as Gordon Ramsay's child
Ramsay is the type of guy who goes home and makes a cup noodle...
What a great father
Take a shot every time Gordon says, a drizzle of olive oil.
Now we're going to season the seasoning with a little seasoning, then rub jacks cheeks in the Seasoned seasoning make it seasoned.
My dad never taught me anything....and he's a professor.
that moment when you're Gordon Ramsay's kid and have to pretend you know something about cooking
This kid seems like he is scared of his dad
Son: But I don't want to be a chef dad!!\nRamsay: You don't want to be a chef?! Have you seen your steaks? They're always FUCKIN RAW!!Son: Fuck you dad, I want to be an engineer! Ramsay: You little fuckin wanker!
I love the patience he show's his children when he Cook's it reminds me of my dad teaching me to use the grill when I was 9. He always made it fun.
Meanwhile on Earth 2.\n\nNice: Jack
Howtobasic\n10x better
he's son?
6:18 Dad....... I’m gay
Poor Jack
Canned tomatoes...ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!?
Food porn 💦💦💦
Omg, looks like my dogs poo, yak discussing! Learn how to cook you overpaid pedo!
22 on trending whoop whoop
Don't be cheeky
Luckily Gordon continues to make these wonderful videos even though a majority of the comments are people being shameless cunts towards his son.
you put olive oil in the pasta water? really gordon? :-((
hhhhhh lol youaer coll
This boy is so lucky! So nice to see them together.
Food tastes better when i watch him cook
Don't be Cheeky .
MMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!
Can't wait til Jack starts swearing.

I can never remember Adele's Rolling in the Deep with this song now stuck in my head.
Just posted a super appreciative comment about this video below... but let's all agree that baro's blue outfit is a huge no-no, seriously who thought that would look good??!
Me : They're back. spread over.\nFriend : Who?\nMe : B1A4. \nFriend : (hysterically) I thought I will not to see them to my end of life.
I thought I will dislike this song, but nope... \nThis is so addicted. It gets stuck in my head. \n🎶 rolling in the 🎵 rolling in the 🎵 rolling in the deep 🎶
Is this masterpiece one of Jinyoung's creation? OMG i really love their music...
The song is dmn good!!!!
Let's not sleep in B1A4 they deserve more views!!!!!!!!!!!
Is it really true that I am seeing ZERO DISLIKES for this MV? or I am just missing something?
I'm LOLLING in the DEAD
been there since debut and they've grown up so much I'M !!! an emotional mess :/
I appreciate every song composed by them..they work really hard..we as a fan should appreciate their work..
So I heard of B1A4 since last time but I never actually hear their song but ytd night I give it a try and hear this song DAMNNN I'm super duper in love with this song I feel like becoming a Bana now  gonna listen to all their song for surw
this really deserves an award. I'm super proud of our boys. :)
this came out of nowhere and I was so UNPREPARED OH MY GOD.\nsomeone hold me, I'm legitimately crying. this was wonderful ;;
I love B1A4✈🌊　〰Rollin〰🌱 good music💝💝💝
No matter what those nasty fans of other idol groups people might say or try to put B1A4 down,  you just can't deny that B1A4 is a legendary group itself. They are truly talented in so many ways.  They are also fun to watch Esp their variety shows. and very humble idols indeed. Each member have a very distinctive style and colour. That is prolly why many looks up to them. Love them to bits and pieces!! They are unique and one of a kind. A gem in the Kpop world. I really appreciate this album because jinyoung did the whole producing and arranging plus the members also wrote and composed the songs in the album too. Watched their interview last night,  Jinyoung said that before this comeback,  he was quite puzzles,  troubled  and challenged because he was pondering on what kind of music and style the group would go for in the near future since they have done different genres previously,  he was really wondering what kind of music would the fans love and prefer and if the public will like it.  He truly is a good leader that always think for his fans and in fact all of them do. For sandeul, he had a challenging time writing the song,  'like a child' because he was trying to capture what he experienced as a kid and his thoughts and emotions to transit into the writing of that song together with baro.  He said the emotions of that song is like,  when you were a child and you listen to your favourite song,  but when you grew up and listen to the same song again, your perspectives changed and he was wondering if he could ever go back to the start where everything was innocent and childlike, he wondered if B1A4 could be this way too. Always going back to the start in the present moment, not forgetting how they all started out as B1A4. He said the song makes you think.  For Baro,  he was amazing too,  it pains me when he told the host that he would usually write his raps when he is alone in a relaxing place or somewhere peaceful so he can have time to think and get inspirations but because the comeback this time kind of clashed with his filming of  manhole, he didn't have enough time left and he actually wrote all the raps in the album at the back of the van or bus late into the night where the filming crew were asleep. Imagine how tired he must have been but he just kept pressing on.  He also travelled alot because of that running from places to places to shoot his TV show and to prepare for the comeback. Cnu also wrote the song,  'call me' and gongchan also gave ideas etc. It just pains a bana like me to know this sort of details,  like how hard working they are even though they have other projects to oversee and despite that they did not forget their fans and their comeback. They must be sooooo tired because baro mentioned that after this comeback, they will take time to rest as jinyoung was having a bad cold recently. He felt that they should take care of their health too as it is important to present a Better part of themselves to fans and because of the love of Banas, whom gave them a lot of strength,  they were able to pressed on.  My boys are so precious and truly top idols. B1A4 go go go!!
They always have catchy songs. I love them 💕
ok but like... B1A4 are so good looking...
Its interesting, that long 'oooooh-yeah' in the middle of the song acts a lot like a guitar riff. its just used to the same effect only its with someones voice. I don't know anything about writing or composing music but I just felt that instant connection upon listening to this song. Anyone else?
Omg they are back!! I like the tune, it's very catchy! ❤
I mean just look at jinyoung!😍😍
World wide song and sound. 😍😍 Perfect
i'm rollin' in the deep...😘😘
I love the new sound and song for B1a4!

2:36 MA DIO PORCO!
Marò è allucinante come qualsiasi tiro nello specchio della porta di Reina, che oramai non para proprio più, si trasformi in goal..Ed anche oggi, la pur ottima Spal, é incredibile a dirsi, con due soli tiri in porta in tutta la partita, ha fatto due goals..E come lo vinciamo stò scudetto con queste medie tiri/goal incassati? Prima o poi ne pagheremo le pere cotte.....comunque brava Spal, che spero si salvi perchè lo merita, e forza Napoli, sempre..
forza napoli ma complimenti alla spal
Ma il dio porco a 2:36? Aahhahahah
2.38 fantastico sentite
Uomo partita : Ghoulam
La Spal meritava almeno il pareggio
Reina è un portiere I-NU-TI-LE. Non esiste prendere un gol del genere, sul tuo palo per giunta.
il 1 a 4 con la Lazio é bugiardo , come sta Vittoria, sta squadra non può essere così colabrodo dietro se vuole sto scudetto.
Ma solo io ho sentito quel ma dio po*co alla fine?

Bella partita,complimenti alla Spal
I kurwa
Forza napoli waglio
Primo a dire primo
Onore a la Spal, ottima partita
Bello sto calcio champagne del Napoli........
...a vedere il campo , nn sembrava messo tanto male... Però magari Sarri x dire che era idegno x la A , avrà avuto le sue ragioni...magari a vederlo dal video non rende l idea non so...chissà,  forse si riferiva al fatto che era sconnesso o x le zolle boo...
Ma in quale universo la spal si meritava il pareggio o addirittura la vittoria? Cioè ragazzi, seriamente, la spal non ha fatto nulla, 2 tiri in porta 2 goal, solo perchè il napoli gioca senza portiere, per il napoli ogni tiro subito è un goal, ma compensa con lo strapotere in possesso palla e azioni. Con un portiere serio lo scudetto sarebbe tutto del napoli.

Bravo a Schiattarella...l'hai fatto mò e nun te permettere mai cchiù. \nAvanti così.... Napoli 4ever !
my you fucks napoli my bets handicap napoli score 3-2 fucks napoli
Vai spal !! Sono della Juventus ma la spal non la facevo così ! Altro che salvezza quest anno può fare molto di più ! Mentre Crotone e Benevento possono già dichiararsi in serie b :)
2:36 Ma Dio Povero
HO LASCIATO SCHIATTARELLA IN PANCA
LA SPAL FORSE SI SALVA MA IL BENEVENTO NE DUBITO
Non vinceranno MAI LO SCUDETTO
3 a 2 è finita
No comment
La spal è fortissima da Beneventano
Questo telecronista mi sembra un acquisto online.\nFa proprio cagare.\nCi manca Sandro Piccinini \nccezionale 
Il boato del 2 2 si è sentito fino a Napoli peccato forza SPAL sempre
Ma voi napoletani come cazzo fate a tenervi ancora Reina. È peggio di Buffon quel portiere li e ce ne vuole, Buffon con la Juve para tutto in nazionale non fa un cazzo, lo voglio vedere io quest' anno a Buffon   hai mondiali. Cmq da milanista dico Napoli buona squadra ma portiere inguardabile e che coraggio subire col sul suo palo.
La spal si meritava la partita
Nel gol di Callejon c'erano 2 giocatori in fuorigioco.Passivi,ma i loro movimenti hanno messo in confusione il portiere
Napoli merda

Che culo il Napoli \nForza Juve
I'd hate to be any kind of driver in London.  Bad enough being a pedestrian.
I'm sorry Taxi Drivers this is a political decision which myself the customer not happy with and I will not be false or persuade or whatever else to use a black cab. I am angered by the way Uber has been treated - it's a useful service which I trust

Fuck black cabs they over charge and con customers that's why people use uber because they are cheaper plus tfl say that black cabs are safer but there has been more sexual assaults by Cab/taxi drivers over the years and they say black cabs are safer my arse they are just as bad as each other
Lol I didn’t know Uber was a thing in the Uk.
Background  checks are exactly the same as all private hire and black cab drivers (ENHANCED DISCLOSURE )  and are submitted to TFL not Uber ....TFL then once everything checks out TFL issue the pco licence to the applicant like any other private hire or hackny carriage driver \n\nUber has no power over the application its all done through TFL    all the reporting has been inaccurate
How will we get our drugs ??
Muslim rapists  .  I'm glad they are gone
pathetic to apologise for what uber have been doing for so long.
Latest figures show that Uber drivers are now responsible for one sex attack in London every week, with sexual assaults by Uber drivers skyrocketing by 50 per cent in just a single year.\nThis is undoubtedly connected to the fact that many of the drivers are from Muslim backgrounds, where “immodest” women are seen as easy prey. Many of the young women who hire Uber taxis late at night are drunk and in some cases scantily dressed.
what a load of shit, Fuck this country, I'm out. George Orwell is laughing at you all.
More than half of Uber drivers there are Muslim..no wonder
Is there another way ? \nMaybe a less greedy app to start with !
Lol it's only cause tfl are not making money from there taxis
New cab coming October 2017 £56,000 not on the road, old cab was £38,000 plus 4 years to do the knowledge, blame LTC, the manufacturer, their the robbers not London cabbies. Most Uber cars under 10k.
I believe many of the Uber employees are black cab drivers also
All these Uber drivers who are saying we have no jobs, just go back to your country and stop raping women
This is bullshit. Black cabs charge too much. Make black cabs charge a fair amount.
Undergrounds just about to get a whole lot busier ..\nI can already barely stand in the tube without having a Chinese man breathing down my ear lobe loool..
Not fit and proper means they should stay banned,
If you want a decent service you pay a decent price.  You get what you pay for.  If Uber drivers want to be a taxi driver then do it.  If they think buying a uniform is expensive then try licensing a taxi and keeping it on the rd.  There's reasons laws are in place for taxi drivers and uber is just a cowboy outfit.  I wonder how many women have been actually attacked.  I bet a whole lot more than the bullshit media lets on.   It ain't safe if anyone can be an uber driver.  Theres a lot of seriously sick twisted fucks out there that thrive off pesting over women and this company gives them the platform to do it.  Result!
This is fantastic news! Yes, Uber is comparatively cheaper and more convenient than most London cabs but the company does not carry out thorough background checks on drivers & has a lacklustre approach to dealing with criminal offenses. So, this means that you are getting on a car with someone who could potentially harm you. I myself was a victim of verbal assualt by an Uber driver who threathened/swore at me only because I pointed out that he was taking a longer route, and when I complained to Uber about this all they did was refunded my fare and dismissed the case. This needs to change. They cannot be running a business making money off us customers and at the same time putting our lives at risk like that whilst taking zero responsibility for anything. It's high time TFL took action and I'm glad that they finally did.
I think the tlf need to take a look in the mirror.
Got an uber ad before this vid, no one in India uses uber tho, we use our regional travelling services, and OLA, which is basically Indian UBER, but without any controversies.
Transport for london is experiencing massive losses so they basically decided to give Uber the big finger so everyone would run back to black cabs busses and trains. Really ... great work well done! 😒😒😒😒😒 one more annoyed Londoner
always showing the nice part of london( central london )  when in reality looks like a dump
I agree with TFL that they should be up to a standard set. But don’t want to see uber go, as it’s the most reasonable transport on a night out
From what I have seen on video it was the Muslim drivers? Is this bias news ignoring the problem or not?
Seems like Britains self grown black Cab service was going out of busssiness cuz of Uber so they had to do suttin about it 🤷🏽‍♀️
Omg 😂  someone said '*how do I get around now?!! If I have to get a normal taxi I'm going throw a fit!!!*'  😂😂😂    I think that was a real person  😂
Black cabs > Uber\n\nOnly cheap tarts who are desperate to be raped use uber
What are the ex Rotherham taxi drivers going to do now for their pleasure.
Black cabs are overpriced. I've used one once and plan to never use one again.
Black cabs in London are WAYYYY too expensive and this smacks of a powerful lobby at work against passengers best interests.
Weirdos taxing strangers... was bound to fail.. i bet the drivers are all foreigners and rapists
Uber will stay and will win in the court! But the drivers will loose their jobs by 2020, once Uber introduces self driving cars.
London is shit anyways been twice it sucks. Better cities to visit in the UK.
if someone wants to pay another person to drive them somewhere that is their right, why does government have to get involved
Good. Protect black cabs.\n\nAnd feck the BBC - fake newsters.
Now people are going to jump into fake taxi by accident 😂😂😭😭
Lyft still is in London
I kinda feel bad for some of the uber drivers that were in my service but I'm also glad black cab drivers are going to have more of their business back
I haven't used uber, but when sexual assault happens by drivers & they make it difficult for the government. Of course they would be banned. It's uber's fault
Get a bike! I Lived 5 years in London, never needed anything else.
I don't care London isn't even in Britain anymore
True cost of cheap price. Corporations that cut corners and do not abide by the law should be and must be punished.
1 rape every 11 days, no valid dbs or medical checks, company pays no tax here, drivers picking up under false car insurance, good riddance
But islam is not a fit & proper religion
I asked my Uber driver what he thought about this. \nHe pulled up in an empty street and sexualy harassed me lol
Reading alot of the comments here, i find it disturbing that Londoners are prepared and willing to put their security and safety at risk for the sake of cheaper taxi fares. If a stranger in a car you've never seen before at a train station or airport was to approach you, tell you his name and age and that he would help you get home, alarm bells would be ringing in your head and thus tell the man to go away but put a taxi app on the phone and suddenly this stranger becomes OK, a person you can trust. Are Londoners truly that gullible?
Well Done Transport for London. Don't be frieghtened to stand up to big companies.
They are appalling drivers, they clog the roads, perform dangerous manoeuvres, speed everywhere. As much as it’s convenient its time the app and it’s drivers go.
Giving us more reason to not live in this shithole called UK...
Uber is a fraud, a con, a scam and tries to suck and blow at the same time.  Dump this junk.  Only the driver and no one else should profit from rides.  Ubers software can be bought for $700 and replicate anything they do. There is no magic in matching a driver with a passenger.
What makes me laugh is all the comments like will have to get black cabs now who rip everybody off etc, none of the people making these comments have ever used black cabs before uber and wont after uber is gone so give it a rest, have you never heard of a minicab office? uber have only been in london a few years what do you think Londoners was doing before uber? minicab offices and black cabs were coexisting peacefully before uber arrived in it will just go back to that, another thing about 40,000 uber drivers face unemployment no they dont they will simply return back to the minicab offices and work from there. Believe it or not black cabs are actually fairly priced you would know this if you ever used them. Iv used both black cabs and minicabs and i support both, the only difference is a black cab driver is a fully qualified taxi driver and knows exactly were there going and the quickest way to get you there i got quoted £15 to go to my local hospital by a minicab firm and a black cab got me there for £14 at 3 in the morning. Theres many apps out there that you can download such as gett fixed taxi fares and alot more. P.S its not the end of the world.
good riddance, london taxi drivers actually have to memorize maps to get the job\nthey shouldnt have to lose their job to some neckbeard landwhale soccer mom who wants some extra cash to buy herself mcDs.
Wait, we are the customers, why can't we do something about this? Theresa May kill TFL off now. Why do we even need this stupid agency? If there's a problem with the company, get a class action lawsuit (that is ALL you need, and some investigators - THAT'S IT), if the company is surcharging somehow or abusing its power, then do the same - prohibiting somebody is just screwing the rest of us while the black cabbies get to charge us through the roof because they don't want to actually work for their money.
Feel sorry for the diver this happened is Austin and lots lost there jobs
uber got 20 million customers and 800k drivers and staff but their petition signed by 300k .
Islamic migrant uber drives rape and assault woman.  I think we know what the real problem is.
Comunist propaganda media BBC is happy that London dropped the license for Uber, what a surprise...
Peng Ting Call Maddison Come Jump In My Addison Lee, Because you can’t take Uber
Damnit I’ll be in London next month
fuck you england you pig ass country. you're bullshitting. you just want to exploit people for cash the same way uber does. black cab drivers can sexually assault as well.
Now the can work in supermarkets  they need trolley man's?
Comply or confiscate 10% of the company. Next non compliance take 30% of the company. Next non-compliance take 50% of the company and send in government representatives to work on their board. First job to sack the CEO.
Black cab nothing else ...but black cab is soul of london
Tfl just mad that they’ve not making enough ££ due to Uber being cheaper and more efficient. Just get better cabs and better rail service and you won’t be hated by the consumer...
There's both good and bad to this
Boo hoo. A tax dodging company with a multi-millionaire at the helm doesn't get the rub of the green for once.\nPersonally, I'd love to see them go out of business. They're basically a loan shark company. If you want to be a cab driver, apply for a licence, learn the knowledge and be a proper cab driver.
Uber had 32 allegations of sexual assault or rape, but there were 122 allegations of sexual assault and rape against black cab and other taxi companies in the UK last year. Why are they not renewing black cab's license? It's all about big money and influence. Black cab transports the Royal family staff and the owner has friends in high places. They're shutting down black cab's competitor, uber,  which is unfair trading practices and goes against free market principles. Competition helps the consumer by offering them lower prices.
good!
MadeInTyo would not be proud.
Fuck tfl
Haha FUCK UBBER
Yes hahahahahaha
Uber rapes
BBC FAKE NEWS
Good
Fake taxi?
Uber was a disgrace good riddance
Uber drivers where dodgey
911 = war with Iran \n\n\n\n\nUBER = war with Syria ?
Good
Uber is shit. Good riddance
You couldnt pay me to go to London
Most uber drivers are poor migrants from eastern europe and middle east, it makes sense to ban Uber so locals can do traditional cab jobs for higher pay.\n\nThis also reduce the number of jobs in that sector so the migrant workers can go back to their own country.
Well Shit

Fuck off!!! Wtf?!

The main reason behind the ban is the New CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. British people hate Middle East people and so is the CEO. Racism at it's peak.
Surely no-one can possibly gain that much power to send 40,000 people into unemployment in such short notice!
So Uber are paying Youtube to put these stories on trending? There's 3 of them, come on. This really isn't a big deal. \nI would say it ucks for the immigrant Uber driver, cuz they will have to go back maybe but to be fair London seems a seperate community to the rest of England so maybe they can stay and just claim benefits like their wives probably do. \nLet's hope this gets sorted out, we wnt peoplpe from wherever working
I liked Uber! Cheaper, better customer service and more accessible than other services AHEM black cabs. This is unfair! I hope they win the appeal!
a step backwards for london
Someone at TFL just got a big brown envelope from the unions running the black cabs that rip us all off for double the price of UBER. So a win for the unions and the little guy gets F%$&ed again! :( and they wonder why the average guy thinks that organisations like TFL are just out of touch!
fck TFL and Fck Black cabs mafia, scums and while you at it fck sadiq khan another crook
If the people over in the UK want to ride in uber taxis, they should be free to do so. If the women fear being raped by an uber driver, they will stop using their services and uber will go out of business due to lack of customers. From what I understand, there are actually less rapes and sexual assaults reported against uber drivers than there are with your black cab drivers. This shows it's all about money and power. Apparently the owner of black cab has influence with the government to shut down his competition that is offering a service at a lower price.
CARALHOOOOOOOO AMO VCS <3
Time to kill Danny cause he killed all the band members! Kappa
See you in Birmingham
Haven't listened to AA in a fairly long time. Just hearing his voice again makes me wanna buy that shit already. You get a claps on Ur butt for coming back.
im always suprised, you guys always make good music! and i really love this new style. your evolution is really fucking great <3
Fuck me this is epic.
Asking Alexandria is southern rock. Not bad
I'm happy as hell that he Is back, but when did he come back??
this is a very painful teaser to the new album.... i cant wait! it sounds good welcome back danny
When I'm older and have my kid ask me what music I used to listen to when I was younger Imma show them this song...
finally!!! Danny!! we miss you so much! 😍😍😍 /m/ amazing voice, please continue doing moooore, this song is awesome!
This song is fucking magical!!!
Totally loved this. Gave me goose bumps every time the chorus came. The breakdown was also legit. 👏🏻😝
Can't stop listening to this song!
Riff sounds a lot like the breakdown in Happy Song by BMTH. \ngood song though. I always liked Danny's voice throughout AA's discography.
Danny is back❤❤❤❤😭 love this song
Damnnnnn this is so good!!! I love his voice in both ways, so much!!❤️❤️❤️
Give me some screams or give me death, Danny. I'm both excited and scared for what this album brings. If this is a lighter song on the album then we're fine. If it's heavy, we're fucked.
Thank God for Auto-Tune cause WorShit's vocals are complete shit!
Weird direction. Don't really like this song because the bridge and chorus sound *exactly* a new Fallout Boy song but I'm curious what else will come. Danny's vocals are sick.
where your car gone danny in min 1:04 - 1:29 and 1:45 - 1:50, maybe editor has been sleepy when editing lol... #AfuckingAFamily
since when did asking Alexandra  get singing lessons from one direction dam they went to shit
songs is ok, I think I may need to listen to it a little more to get used to this new sound.. just hope there are heavier songs on the album
MY GUYS ARE BACK TOGETHER!!!!!!!!!
So is this Ben and Cam sayin' AA is Danny's band, because we saw the way that worked out for Chiodos... #Devil  ...or is it a glorious return of Worsnop because unlike Brandon Bolmer with Chiodos, Denis's version never stood a chance of being the best of AA's work?
FUCKING AMAZING COULDN'T BE ANY BETTER
Fuck Yes! I didn't even know there was any thing being written. I wasn't sure at first, but I'm down.
If you don't understand Danny has taken his voice to a whole nother level you will never understand what this band could end up being.... This is a new beginning for AA and they will take over the rock scene again
AA was my favorite band, and now they are again!
Thank god for warsnop, i hated the replacement
um, ive listened to this song for a bit now, but is it just me that feels like whoever mastered this track made the vocals not stand out very much
We spent $5,000 on this wind machine and I'll be damned if we aren't getting our moneys worth!
I'm happy to say that asking is back and ready to rock!!!
I've watched this at least 30 times already, it's too good
Danny is staring at the car upside-down, trying to figure out where the driveshaft disappeared to.
Quality song and video
Ok he can scream! Love it
Wow Kylo Ren is playing a guitar...
Thank God...they are back I'm fucking stoked
would've been better without the screaming, it sounded pretty catchy but it got ruined mid way.
BITCH I STOPPED, WHAT MUSIC DOES FUCK
this song is sex to my ears.
I like it but it sounds like a commercial type of song for video games.
Peter? Is that you? Is me Walter #FRINGE
Why is Danny back? Where's the other dude?
i really like the song, but you can hear some auto tune on a few parts...
The vocal boy is more fat!
Yeah, this is one of my favorite songs. The other one is YMCA by Village People.
nice video, borring music (((  too light... where is THE VIOCE?!
Wow... honestly his cleans have had a major improvement. Not sure if that's from the rock stuff he did, but whatever it was he got better.
shit ((((
Missed gou guys soo much
Love this song🙈

Reminds me Bring me the Horizon, LoL :D

Please please please shave that god damn beard!!!!!!
Family 🤘🏼
Danny ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
So it wasn't until like ten minutes ago that I found out that Danny is back in Asking. Glad to see the original five back together!
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
Welcome back Danny! You were surely missed
Drummer must be bored as FUCK. Reckless and Relentless for life.
Who is the vocalist?
Esto se merece más de un millón de vistas T.T❤
yay dannyyy
Danny is god <3
Fuckin' amazing song...!!!!
More More More wb Danny, nice Song.
Sincitycore
Danny must've googled big boy words and started screaming the first things he saw.
The drop G # tuning just makes the guitar muddy and inaudible at points
VIVA EL ROCK!!
#intothefire #askingalexandria #thisfamilyisforever
Dennis should be there instead
Denis sings better and screams better... Danny go back to harlet or be a country boy on what ever those horrlibe side projects was. Your to mainstream for Asking Alexandria, you hold them back.  I've liked every AA album a lot. then I herd The Black and it's the best album or maybe a tie with reckless and relentless.  BRING DENIS BACK!!!
where is Denis Stoff ?
honestly confused that this has so many dislikes, honestly this is VERY good. this next album might be my new favorite by them
Dany Worsnop voltou pro AA? ❤
Thank you Michael boy.
Michael Cera doesn't look like himself.
This is the most Michael Cera thing Michael Cera has ever Michael Cera'd before
This shit is fire. Fuck every negative comment. Like we didnt know Cera had the heat tucked in.
this makes me question everything.
i found this tremendously pleasant
Go Bleeker!
This is a really really really nice way to stark the week :)
This is what hipsters look like in 2017
Hey it's Jimmy's brother, the singer!
That was adorable good job MC
Jesus Christ he’s perfect
Napoleon Dynamight the music video.
I was seriously expecting Michael Cera, this video gets a D+ for okay music
WHERE IS HE. WHERE'S MY BOY.
this is white as fuck
It's like the musical version of Michael Cera and Wes Anderson masturbating in a room together while blank staring into each other's eyes. You know, basically hipster porn
Cera is back yesss
I fucking love Michael Cera
i was not expecting to genuinely enjoy this as much as i did
Who the fuck is Michael Cera???
It’s jus to dam positive for me to enjoy but I can’t even hate it cuz that’s me issue
for 4 minutes and 39 seconds of my life, i did not want to die. thanks mikey cera
How the fuck did Michael Cera have an indie pop song in him? This is wild. Song is 7/10 | Very pleased.
This is my favorite dong currently. Can I put it in an indie film I made?
Representation of exploitation? I don't know but this sounds like an ok Washed Out or one of many other indie artists i've long forgotten about. Two thumbs negative neutral.
He's Jimmys brother!.. the guy with the beautiful voice! Sing for us!
Sharon's the fucking greatest btw
Does anyone know the name of the font? Im like obsessed with it!
This is amazing
36 people are douchebags
Tanks boi u make my day :D
buna bayıldım
Sounds like Cat Stevens' Sitting.
If he change his name to something and do some plastic surgery on his face so no one could know that It was made by him, I'll love it
Legit adorable. Had to share with my boyfriend. ❤❤❤

So good
DJ CERA!!!
Omfg
esto es saber aser musica que gran cancion
Using disabled people as a cute factor. Not really into it. Kind of ablest. Disability is a lot more than just cute.
Im so confused. Is this like Michael Cera Michael Cera or a different Michael Cera?
Michael Cera sure is a man of many talents!
no matter how good the song is, i never fully like music projects from people who are already famous/have a big fanbase. I mean the song is alright, but no better than some songs i've heard with less than 100 plays.
turrible
When i seen Michael Cera i was excited because i actually thought I'd hear some vocals but now i see its more like when you see DJ Khaled on something except,i don't wanna hear those vocals.
WHAT SONG IS THIS GUYS?????
Pitchfork usually sucks aids out of cocks but thumbs up on this one!  this song is so legit\n\nthe video was sorta disgusting though.. disabled people are gross. Still thumbs up!
Strongest glass ever?
if u want to sell the mobile plzz contact me
Why the fuck are there so many Indians typing grammatically incorrect sentences about the iPhone being bad.
i have an idea juste care of your phone and everythings become okay and this video become useless
And this is why I'm never an iPhone owner
Am I the only one getting tired of technology?
Apple team where you at?
Send me both, I'll repair both 😂😂😂😂😂
I'm sorry but everybody's a loser the moment the glass breaks well there goes a $1000 The only winner I see is the company that gets to charge you to fix your phone
Samsung galaxy note 8 amazing and iphone 8 not good
I would still use it lol
Note 8 is gay tho it looks ugly iPhone8 wins
Someone sue apple for fake advertising 😅
JUST DON'T DROP YOUR PHONES PEOPLE
Apple Fans Have nothing to say😂
Um. Instead saying strongest glass how bout choosing a material that doesn't shatter??? Wow this world is dumb.
The new iPhones aren't good!
For me bth were equally fragile.. just dat the curved glass on the note makes it Dodge straight drops.. would b interesting to see what happens when it lands on the edge
Samsung always the best 💪💪
All people who disliked this vid r mindless apple users (mindless cuz they really believed apple for once was the most durable😂
Doesn't apple always claim their phones are innovative and the most durable? But yet some how they always crack before most other phones dk
2.5 d curve is the best durable glass till date and im still happy with it.. ..now im really feeling scared to buy one note 8 or s8 plus :(
why don't you mention the height of drop test?
That is supposed to be the most durable glass on a phone. hahahahahaha SMH. JOKERS
Please just give away the iPhone to me? Rather than you smashing it lol
Iphone 8. It has the strongest glass in the world...except for the Note 8
I've always had an iPhone but recently switched to the Note 8. These are encouraging results :D
beat that apple
i hate iphone
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqmO3D9Ucdg6Eaaj70mT4CQ
SS NOTE8 VERYGOOD FOR ME
What's probleme bro
My phone ahhhh
Got the note 8
😢
RIP🍎
Samsung win
Apple suck ballz
Drop test on XZP ✋
Yeah.. Samsung  rules....
note 8 better
Come after iPhone 8 drop test
video starts at 1:30
Regalamelo jiji
اتوقع النوت بسبب الشاشة المنحنية تاثر كذا\nاتوقع لو موب موجودة كان كان الضرر اقل\nايضاً النوت يطيح بعدين يرقى فوق ويرجع ثانية يطيح\nيعني الطيحة الوحدة عن ثنتين
dead ass at this point idk how you can even trust Apple's marketing
Yeah, people are totally going to be dropping their phones from 6 feet onto steel plates, that’s definitely a real life scenario.
Apple hasn't used any type of laminate on their phone screens, which can cause chunks of glass to simply fall off. Considering what happens in the video, I'm assuming they've taken the same approach with their back glass as well.
Apple is full of shit. I've never seen a company lie so much about what they do. It's incredible.
There's no glass back not 8..u must be with Apple
I'll go with Note 8 anytime. No thanks for iShit.
I watch a video where both resist the fall this seems like this guy got paid by Samsung
Hlo bro. I'M from India ..please give me iPhone 8 as a gift plz bro.. give me a one..
I’m still buying the 8plus.. who tf has an iphone without a case?
I love Samsung Samsung is best
Hope to see iPhone X vs note 8 drop test!!!!
I thought I was a class 1 waste man..I learned I'm wrong now after watching this video..hard to believe someone needs to make a video like this..if you drop your phone and break it..well it's just one of those things..get a repair done or buy a replacement phone..then look after it better next time..\nSimple tings !!!!!
Samsung note 8 is 100 times better than Iphone 8 and iphone x.
is it just me or iphone camera got scratched in first test?
maybe strongest glass only for apple phones, but overall phones, its a joke...
This product is Cheapest price,available for sale from China without tax go through During 2017's National's day, Purchase from  China Electronics wholesaler: https://goo.gl/xXprm3
Samsung phones are amazingly durable.  I have an S6 Edge Plus and recently I learned I had a hole in my pocket that worst way, getting out of car my phone fell down my inner pant leg and landed below my first foot out, screen down.  I stepped on it putting my full weight on it pushing my screen against a very rough concrete and dirt parking garage floor.  I could feel the phone scrape.  Pretty much a worst case scenario in trying to break my phone.  My screen actually looks a bit worse than your Note 8 after even the 10 bonus drops but it all worst 100% fine... Camera, touch (even over most of the damaged parts), bluetooth, everything.  Major cracks across my whole phone and on the side I stepped on first major pock marks.  I used it like that for 2 weeks with no problem at all, screen is still staying in one piece no pieces coming off.  I finally got a screen protector just in case it decided to fall apart (didn't want to get cut up) and have used it for over a month now, just waiting to see the holiday deals before I probably upgrade to an S8+ or Note 8... though honestly everything still works, might just hold onto it longer.
i actually think this drop test is useless because theres literally nothing that wouldnt break if u drop it
The Note 8 got less damage because the bounce absorbed more energy and the Iphone 8 landed dead on
I'm out I can't bear to see awesome phones breaking lol
I am so disappointed with I phone 7 ...so for normal use I bought one huawei phone as well...don't waste  Mony for I phone...:@
I got the Note 8  four days ago and love it, I'm waiting on a screen protector that goes with my otterbox and was super scared to drop it, at least this makes me a little more confident walking around with out a screen protector.  Also glad I got the Note instead of iPhone I've had other notes in the passed which is who I chose the new one, why would i downgrade to an iPhone when I know what the galaxy's  can do lol
NEWS FLASH!!!: when you drop glass on hard surfaces.....it breaks.
Speed test with note 8!!!!
Note 8 win of course
Strongest glass my ass. Also, the Note 8 after the bonus round looks just like my friends phone, jesus!
Every1 hating on apple but we still got the 6s, not saying its better than an s8 or a oneplus, but battery is long lasting (for me) graphics on games are insane, and the 6s is a nice small useful phone.
where is the speed test though?
The cam strip is probably loose , I'm sure it works If it's connected back on s8
I was going to get the iphone 8 plus tomorrow but i'm so disappointed with apple 😢😢😢
Well apple didn't lie. Strongest glass meaning 0.1% stronger. I'd say it's still false advertising.
galaxy note 8 is the best smart phone ever made
Fuck iPhone
iphone 8 is ass hahaha
5:28 that laugh, shamed that ho good.
iphones are a joke
Ohh... smartphone nowadays!! So fragile

Yuck

wow loving the hair !
Jeffree please please do a tutorial on this eye look it's stunning!! ❤️
Blue looks amazing on you!!! ☆♡☆♡☆
You are so flawless. I'm in awe by your beauty but never comment on it.
Did I miss something? Why are there so many dumbasses on Jeffrees' video today? Jeffree is a fucking Queen/King/Intergalactic alien or whatever else you want to call him, but all I know is he'll get into his spaceship and slay into a galaxy far far away while you're still over here giving him your views and making him some coin💸
A lip stain is exactly what it says it is it is meant to be applied the wiped off !! It stains your lips so you dont have to have the 💄 lipstick feel !!
Lol there are more comments about the hate comments then actually hate comments. This is what happens when people love you
Adored all the colors with the look EXCEPT the Charlotte Tilbury Screen Siren, which I think completely made the look more clown like
I want to live like Jeffery. A big house, a hubby, and four dogs.
I NEED a tutorial on your eye look!!!!!
It would be amazing if you did a review on Besem cosmetics!
I miss the bright color brows!!!
I bet the lip scub that nate created is weed scented lol 😂😂
Love that blue, beachy-wavey hair!!!!
Everyone says that you look like you come from hell, and they're attempting to be rude. But I want people to tell me that?? I take that as a compliment because b, you look cool AF in my opinion.
I don't understand the need to spread unnecessary hate? What's the point? I'm seeing a lot of hate towards Jeffree and I don't why people feel necessary to comment rude ass shit. If you don't like him then move on with your life and let him be. And for those of you who consider him vile for being who he his, look in the mirror, you're the only thing thats vile, you're the only thing thats needs to be rid of in this world. There is NOTHING wrong with expressing who you are. So fuck off if you don't like him
Some of these comments here are actually worse then the racist comments Jeffree made in the past.
yooo i went to drag con to meet him and manny and the line was closed off. i felt like crying 😂😂
I love how you have your own lipstick line & no matter what, you still give props to other lip lines! You are everything! I love you girl!! ❤️❤️❤️ your so positive!!
No one is talking about Jeffree's makeup, oh it's so amazing. This look drag makeup but also really fits him. FUCKING BEAUTIFUL
I love you Jeffree I'm sorry for the mean things I've said on your channel. You have professional insight.
your look channels a mermaid that just had sex
WHEN ARE YOU MAKING A JEFFREE STAR FOUNDATION!!!!!
He is so extra. I love it!
You look GORGEOUS!😍
I am living for your look! The blue hair, your eyes. Bitch. SLAY!! 😍😘🖤
Hey Jeffree can you make an update to your hair transplant? Thanks!
Your look is amazing   I love it s9 much😄😄😄😄😄😄
Love ❤️❤️the Blue Hair !!!!! Love ❤️ the way you keep things real
Jeff you better qpwm and do a tutorial on this eyeshadow
I love the mini nudes packaging
Boo! I love the blue hair!😚
I LOVE YOUR HAIR!!
You look like a siren. Super cute!
I like how his hair and eyebrows kinda look like the shade expensive from his palatte beauty killer
I love that blue on you!
Jeffree you’re giving me mermaid  vibes with your look 👀 ! Damn Girl you are beautiful ❤️👑🐠
Hello Jeffree!!! Love your videos! 🙌🙌🎀🎀 please would you do a smash box lip swatch video 🙀🙀 would love to see what all the Matt shades and metallic shades look like 😍 !
Tell me why I'm getting 2007 Jeffree star vibes with this look 🖤🖤
your look today is giving me Beauty Killer album cover vibes and I'm loving it
Getting major MySpace era Jeffree vibes from this one.
love wht you do i like this look on you .... keep it up
do a review on Chantecaille products x
I would love a tutorial on that eye look Jeffree, it's really pretty😍😍😍
Jeffree star I have a question to ask you about putting the normal size lipstick container in the same size  as the mini's but normal size in the same box that will be really really cute.
THIS LOOK ON YOU IS GOOOOOOORGEOUS
do a video on trying black lipsticks!!
It's a lip tint! It isn't supposed to pigment like a liquid lip. I love lip stains! Korean lip stains and that formula always works better for me. They add color, they don't set on your lips like a liquid.
Bro their is so much other shit going on, and here we are talking about a fucking flag
What do you know about respect ????????
Damn everybody be hating on Trump. I'm a #Trumpsupporter , deal with it.
#MAGA liberals are the epitome of hypocrisy.
Respect for the players.
Retarded af lol
I HATE CNN!
Don't know whether to like for Trump or dislike for CNN...
This draft dodger has no right to lecture anyone on patriotism and respect. What a moron, and if you still support him, the label goes to you as well.
*FAKE NEWS FACTCHECK:* Trump didn't say NFL team owners _should_ fire players in this video - he merely stated a rhetorical wouldn't you love to see what-if scenario!\nTrump: Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners when somebody disrespects our flag, to say 'Get that son of a bitch off of the field right now - out! He's fired - HE'S FIRED!'\nCNN's video description: President Donald Trump criticized some in the NFL... _saying_ _team_ _owners_ _should_ _fire_ _players_ _for_ _taking_ _a_ _knee_ _during_ _the_ _national_ _anthem_ \nSeems like CNN just can't stop lying about what Trump says! The description talks about this as if he was making official policy recommendations for the NFL owners, when all he's doing is speaking in an off-the-cuff manner directly to his base! Jeez!
FINALLY a President with COMMON SENSE!
I wish US presidents respected Freedom of Speech.
Love all the libtards bitching, ever since you lost all political power thats all your good for,Trump 2020!
And the worst part of it all is this protest has NOTHING to do with disrespecting the flag. The protest is about drawing attention to the huge amount of unarmed black people killed by police and those same police not facing any consequences for their actions. People have been tricked into thinking it's about disrespecting the flag and are too stupid to realize it.
If all these folks don't like the protest why not do something to address the reason why they're protesting? Then they will stop. Common sense. Instead of saying I am going to put an end to police butality like a good leader. But instead Trump and his supporters would rather force them to stand. Welcome to America. The self proclaimed greatest country in the world.
How many kids watched this, y'all talk about respect for the flag so much but the president doesn't even respect professionalism. If Obama said this he'd been portrayed as incompetent
America is the laughing stock of the world, and it's much deserved.
Pretty sure people wished donald respected American flag also...
Thanks trump for standing up for our country even if i am not a big fan of yours !!!!  This is so disrespectful when the NFL and players stand for this evil !!! i want to see these whining spoiled brats go to another country and make millions. o yes no other country pays for spoiled brats to play a game. people don't get it. we will not have any freedom if we have no  country anymore. where is people's brains go hello !!! If we keep going down this path we are going be broke!!!!
He's fired...............................................
Trump should focus more on leading the country \nThen on dumb shits that don't stand for the flag
Nobody understands Donald Trump's personality like I do he is this kind of person he talks too much and trying to be funny and trying to devise people he likes attention once he goes home he feels totally empty so he has to do it on daily basis to feel good otherwise he's feeling empty 24/7
Trump-is-the-greatest-president-America-ever-had.............
Youtube video commenter🎉  https://videocommenter.com ❤💓💟💜💛
I have to be honest. Yeah. I would love if an owner did that.
he said the flag, but not the soil rich with the blood of patriots?
I wipe my ass with the flag everyday. Thats all its good for now that trump destroyed the country.
Chad W , lmfao xbox is not serving our country 😂
Fuck that ugly ass Donald trump trying to make life great for white people bitch
We live on a speck of blue in an ocean of darkness - Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner.\n\nHow frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, are challenged by this point of pale light.  Well said Carl Sagan!
Well said! It's completely disrespectful to do that to our anthem
Stupid Americans.......\nRetard nation.....\nPower to Black people....\nFrom Croatia with love.... 😂😂👍
yall.... you're president is wining over some people excising their right to free speech while we're on the brink of war with N. Korea and a whole ass territory of ours is literally without power and destroyed. Trump is literally a damn joke. His ass was never fit for this job if he can't focus on the real issues surrounding this country.
I'm a vet and have and would risk my life so that people have the right to free speech.  This isn't free speech, it's misdirected and an insult.  Trump is just saying what 3/4 of Americans feel, that this is an inappropriate way to protest and that it's disrespectful to veterans and America as a whole (in his own offensive way).  Arrogant elites don't care and will tell you if you should be upset.  Next they will burn the flag at a game and claim that we shouldn't be upset.  I don't need the NFL or any other sport that has such disrespect.
They're being disrespectful to the flag you cunts. It stands for America. Literally, you're just letting the flag and America down. Leave the country.
I would like to apologize to our President for telling him to stfu. My emotions got a the best of me. Even though I don't agree with him but he's still our President.
🤔🤔He missed a great opportunity to try to turn some rich Black guys Republican.😶😶😶 I wonder what would happen if a couple hundred of HIS employees decide to take the knee?
Wow i cant believe people are still on this. Its been going on for years now. Can we as a people just admit americans in general struggle with doing the humane thing and move on?\n\nIts not like that country or its people really care. If they did trump wouldve been removed from office long ago. No instead we do this cherry picking dance where one side goes oh the other is so bad. While the other side does the same. Both sides will find ways to fuck everyone over and americans and america will go right back to being racist at the end of the day. \nJust look up US's history. A disastrous nation that committed to letting the jews die right up till they joined the war  during the world war. And again with its confederate war, placing war-criminal statues in areas that used to sell slaves as a constant stinging reminder for slavery. And again with trying to repeal and replace the aca, 3 attempts to throw hundreds of people with life threatening illnesses off of life saving healthcare (affecting men, women, children, infants, the elderly and the severely sick) for money \n\nThese are just really bad people who pretend like theyre nice but honestly couldnt give two shits about anyones life or death as long as they get money. \n\nAfter a while of that shit you realize, naw its not the american politics thats messed up, its the people! They simply care more about money than any person living or dying - thats why in a democractic nation you get people like hillary and trump running. \nEnough excuses: americans are racist assholes. See there! Now no matter how bad their politics get its just becomes: oh yeah thats to be expected just look at the people.
Says the guy who fled the draft 😂😂😂😂.
Trump is a stupid old fucking airhead as dumb as dog shit !
I try to follow politics as little as possible, but wow this is so embarrassing.
Proper Flag Etiquette\nNever Dip the flag for anyone or anything\nNever place the flag horizontal\nNever let the flag touch the ground\nNever wear the flag as clothing\nNever cover the flag\nNever use the flag to cover anything\nNever lay the flag flat or carry anything on it\nNever use the flag as decorations\nNever tie up or fold back the flag, always let it fly free
From all the reasoning Americans to the world: We apologize for the nonsense and ignorance of this man, we in the true mayority do not want this guy. Many Trump voters wish they had listened to Bernie 😂,  we are working in getting rid of this chump.🕜💸👊💢 and to get america back up from the stations of education, employment, and health sectors it is sadly in.
Trump should be helping rebuild Puerto Rico but yet he's still ranting on pointless issues
This dude has no room to talk about sports at all, what he needs to worry about is how much time he will have left in the office if he keeps this bullshit up because I already want this asshole out of office right now, I mean who is he to say that NFL players need to be fired for taking a knee during the national anthem I mean its freedom of speech. This guy is a fucking disgrace to this country and deserves to be fired as president. #FUCKTRUMP
IN A DEMOCRACY PROTESTING IS A BASIC CIVIL RIGHT.. HOWEVER, THE PROTEST SHOULD NOT VIOLATE THE DIGNITY OR THE RIGHTS OF OTHER PEOPLE... THE BLACK NFL PLAYERS ARE TRYING TO HIGHLIGHT A WRONG BY DOING ANOTHER...DISRESPECTING THE  FLAG OF YOUR GREAT NATION IS PERVERSION.....I THINK THESE GUYS JUST JEOPARDIZED THEIR ORIGINAL AGENDA.......
Freedom to kneel, freedom for their employers to fire them for it, freedom to boycott the NFL. Period
you know what? GO TRUMP
Beware Alabama voters Trump may have had to do a deal with the devil. Check Bannon on fox news. Mitch McConnell endorses Strange and given millions to get him in.
Why can't blacks get it through their thick skull that whites today aren't responsible for their damn slave ancestors 2-300 years ago and if they don't like this country's history then maybe they should go back to where their ancestors originated from. Everything has to revolve around blacks these days like wtf. America would also be less racist if people who don't support it go back to their home country.
Great speech. We in Germany forgot what is national pride.
Funny, isn't it that when nazis and klans men take to the streets carrying torches, traitorous flags and guns, it's Free Speech.. But if NFL players simply TAKE A KNEE, now that's where the Trumpettes draw the line. That's high treason. Assholes.
Your just a smug son of a bitch always talking out your ass.i can't believe this is the actual president
This man doesn’t like black or white but he does LOVE ❤️ Money 💰
He doesn't respect the world ...and he wants respect for a flaggy'', here we go, all the WASP wanna be parroting on
That's a total disrespect... YOU KNOW WHAT IS DISRESPECTFUL CALLING SOMEONE A SON OF A B*TCH  BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEE THEIR F*CKING POINT OF VIEW BECAUSE YOU'RE SO CAUGHT UP IN YOUR SELF!
Sports is sports, politics is politics, etc. Alot of people don't know that NFL is a patriotic sport, its not a sport that just came out. NFL has always been an American family sport. People barbeque, have parties, relatives together from great distances. Its like the first thanksgiving for the year for diehard Americans. Now you go shit on the flag then you indirectly will cause a shift in the tides. Now live with it and brace for impact from the backlash. You want to protest go on the streets Don't be lazy.
I'm waiting for the day Donald Trump gets fired
crazy country with crazy president u representing a big threat to this world
God Bless the Dallas Cowboys and owner Jerry Jones for showing Trump that we are The United States of America, this is NOT Trumpamerica. Amen guys! That was awesome!
The US must be warned that Trump is a populist. He's not different to Chaves or Castro. He uses people's simbols to take advantage for himself. He uses 'Divide and rule' and wants to create a crack between the people of the United States calling everyone who isn't at his side a traitor. If this trend continues he will turn the US into a third world country.
Punish them Mr President. Time to sanction these wayward owners.
Oh look what you've done now, dotard! Just added fuel to the fire! Oh not to mention, for all you Trump supporters, when North Korea launches a Nuke over here and people are dying, this Stupid Son of Bitch will be in a bunker while America Citizens are dying. Make America Great Again! Yeah Fucking Right, let's start a 3rd World War because our POTUS doesn't know how to shit the fu#@ up and talk to people other than his own base.
It didnt take him that long to talk about this and for some reason it took longer for him to say neo-nazis and white supremacist are bad people
Trump is a racist...a filthy lowlife with an orange face clown hair small hands and no intellect....in addition to being a born liar and a Putin buttboy....a traitor.
Glad to have a president who is brutally honest
Why the fuck are these football players getting all political for! Stupid fool get off your knees and show some respect
You have to respect the flag or lose your job..... coughfeeling like nazi America
Trump is the best and most realistic president that this country has ever had.  :)
What a fucking girl man, not everyone likes youre fucking country unfortunately. LIVE WITH IT !
The owners are cowards. Afraid to do the right thing.
TRUMP IS A COMPLETE DISRESPECT FOR ALL I STAND FOR... \nLIKE TRUTH, THE CONSTITUTION AND FREEDOM!!!!!
This Idiot has to be a Comedian, he can't be real....LMAO..#BUM
Finally an America loving president after 8 years of U.S.A. hating POS Obama and the whole Democrat Party.
Funny how he is all up on the NFL players for taking a knee and calling it disrespect but yet he is disrespecting latinos, black, etc. hypocrite asf 😂💀
Disrespectful to kneel in protest. Ok . What about calling people you don't even know sons of bitches. And why is the president talking about NFL ratings when we have so many issues in this country and around the world. Where are your priorities and you're the president. It's embarrassing
the thing goes skrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa papapapap bang bang pow pow
CNN fake news employees......Faggots, baby killers, skank bitches, crack whores, ass rammers, cock-suckers, lesbians, dyke cunt munchers, black dick eaters, bottom ass fuckers, GOD haters,  shit stains, cum bubbles, quaff farts, anal lubers, ass finger fuckers, homo shit eaters, cum guzzlers, fetus eaters, abortion lovers, shitty dick lickers, piss drinkers, asshole pirates, fist fucking ass reamers, tuna cootch bitches, mackerel breath twats, taint biting dick swallowing animal fuckers. ...\nAnd Anderson's POOPER.

WHO HATES TRUMP?\n\n█▬█ █ ▀█▀ LIKE

Little penis talks shit
God Bless Emperor Trump.
FUCK! YOU! TRUMP!
Look its #BLACKLIVESMATTERNEWS #CNNFAKENEWS
That's right!!!
Wtf did I just watch
Love my president! ❤️
Suck a dick trump ass bitch
2 term president.
Free speech?
I fucking love Trump!!! Whooooo
Supreme Leader Donald John Trump!
what a joke
politics  and sport don't mix, respect  and  no bullying .sometime People  make mistakes,  a good man can say sorry,  and move on.  We all make mistakes, Black or white \nEveryone  has a s the right to live  and not be killed . Everyone  must follow  laws ,respect  goes both ways, police  must respect  human rights and not shoot unarmed  people
Fuck all of this coverage about the athletes protesting, this is the lowest fucking thing we have to worry about in this country right now.  We could potentially go to war with NK, our foreign relations are going to hell day by day, and we have become the laughing stock of the world because of Trumps horrible leadership.  Every msm channel has jumped on this retarded bandwagon to distract everyone from how fucked our situation is actually becoming, there are far more important things than Trump vs.  protesting athletes .
YES GO TRUMP!!! 💙❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸
Trump is the worst president in our nation's history. They voted for a reality show and they got it.
Bowie would love this... Electronic, ambient and rock. Just what he wanted to do in 'Heroes'. They just did that in 21century's way.
They have been singing it live on the Global Spirit Tour. Amazing to hear. :')
I even didn't  see Istanbul/Ankara/Izmir  concerts in the upcoming concertlist. Other cities even will be good. PLS organize this. Otherwise, i am going to  abroad to watch those guys as a Turkish   Devotee.
can't stop listening. So good
a group of legends making a good tribute to another legend. Loved this video.
In one word.... WOW!!
Снова не оправдал надежд трек
I love DM from Czech Republic!
It's different i surpose but you can't the original
👍👍 For this 😀 David will be very proud ☺
Everything started with this song ❤
NO PARECIERA DM BUT IT SOUNDS BEAUTIFULL, Thanks DM, its wonderfull cover
his voice is fantastic a lot of singers seem to lose it a bit as they get older but at 55 he sounds as good as he did 30 years ago -after a few listens though i think this is a decent cover but - not very exciting? like someone else commented it kinda reminds me of u2 haha
What can I say just about the best cover version ever totally amazing DM
LONG LIFE TO D.M.
Lyrics/letra ?
Very good DM!!! Saudades Bowie 😔... from Brazil
Sólo Depeche Mode!!!
Magical ✨
I💗DM from Croatia
David gahan and David Bowie, are genius singer
What more can I say but beautiful, David looking down smiling...CatzMeow
Classic song done by the masters depeche,excellent vocals,mr Bowie will most definitely approve
Love the band but they don't do very good covers
as  good.. as perfect ... as the original ! David Bowie is proud
Sorry I don't like it
Perfect !
What a cover!
3:43 We can beat them, foreverrr and everrrrrrrrrrrr I'm crying now.
God, I love DM too much. Sublime <3
THIS IS DEVINE! AMAZING, TRUE ROMANCE
can't stop listening to it, it's too beautiful
This is the best version of this song, and of course it had to be by Depeche Mode! Absolutely amazing and brilliant!. Gracias DM!
Oh this is a great song! I love how the tune goes from lows at the beginning to the highs at the end! Amazing music and vocals!
Great cover by a great band....:)
Beautiful cover...brilliant band. DM forever and ever...they can be heroes but not only for one day..
I was curious,but stopped it around the 45 sec. mark..
..How much did I need to cry, just like fucking right now....?
An epic band covers an epic artist/song. Beautiful.\n\nGreetings from Greece
Thanks from ITALY. We love DB
Just superb! The legend says the Mode's discovered Dave singing this tune...
David Bowie is my idol. And Depeche Mode one of my fav bands. I saw this cover in the stade de France on 3 months ago, it was so intense... Thanks for this incredible moment.
Much better than the LIVE version.
Performed by Depeche. Written by Bowie. Colored by Prince. Perfect.
Doe o coração em lembrar do David Bowie. Mas ele cumpriu sua missão  em nos trazer alegria. Depeche Mode veio para comprocar isso e também que David realmente é imortal. Um heroi
Спасибо, Депеш!
Marzo llega YAAAAAAAA
ءפ輪
ахуенно !
Love from Greece ❤️ 🇬🇷17-5-2017
Как я долго ждал эту версию не концертную....бьюти
Дейв, спасибо тебе огромное за песню и особенно за то, что выдержал стиль и ритм Девида!!! Необыкновенно получилось, как у Девида!!!
Охуенчик старый добрый депешь!
Наверно самое лучшее исполнение песни Боуи!
Best band ever...
🇧🇷👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Top!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
♥* D

Beautiful tribute. RIP Bowie <3
Heroes... tout a commencé par cette chanson pour DM... Dave Gahan chantait cette chanson pour une audition pour un groupe... Et Martin Gore l'a entendu...
Sounds like Elvis Presley

Gracias DM por tantos años acompañándome en cada situación de mi vida, acariciando con su musica mi alma y  espalda en momentos difíciles
Great cover <3
encore .... encore  ... encore Dave ne t'arrête pas, jamais de nous emmener dans ton monde, de faire passer des émotions dans ta voix.
Una idea solo por pensar en que algún día pudiera suceder: DM + Robert Fripp = Super Heores
Qué maravilla! Qué sonido! Qué elegancia y estilo! Qué sutileza versionando al maestro! Qué gran grupo: la gran escuela británica de los 80.
No mamen, ¿en qué momento Miguel Bosé se volvió vocalista de Depeche? Se oye igualito.
Simplemente genial, excelente versión de Bowie pero en vivo se te pone la piel de gallina...
Que Lindo Cover del Gran Bowie muy Buena y la Bella Voz de David Depeche como siempre Good Brothers 🖐✌✌

Boring as hell. Jacob Dylan much better
This is just mesmerizing... a truly astonishing form of musical art performed by one of the greatest bands. Brilliant.
Meh, not really into this. It's a bit on the bland side.
Joshua Trees!

Anyone know where to get that bedding?? I have been looking on google for two days 😅
I've been Called Daphne by so many people, who don't even know each other, since school. I'm not even ginger I just apparently have her mannerisms haha
I hope you feel better and that everything works out with the doctors. :)

If u love Gabriella then sub to my channel
am I the only one who really really really wants to be gabbies friend? such a cool, nice, funny and sweet person, I need a gabs in my life
Wow what a pobox you're so lucky 💛💛💛
Unfortunately the calcium content in the cream cancels out the way you absorb the iron in the spinach :-(
Does anyone know where the peaches bed set is from!?
B12 deficiency is horrible. I have pernicious anemia as felt the same way for so long, i was faintly near daily, constantly tired, didn't want to eat or see anyone. It was pants. Hopefully if it is that you will start feeling better once you get the injections or tablets. They really perk you up!
My body can’t produce vitamin b12 or folate and I’d been struggling on and off for years and kept being given tablets. I had the worst case of it ever this year, and went from November 2016 until August 2017 having constant migraines and nausea to the point where I didn’t want to go out or face the world. So I went to the doctor’s again and I’m now on injections for the B12 every 3 months and they’re the best thing ever!!! I’m still on folate tablets too but honestly after the first 3 injections (you get once a week for three weeks to begin with) I felt so good. I still get tired every now and again and I know how shit it is, but once it gets treated it’s super easy to keep on top of. Hope you feel better soon!
Can I just be your family friend? Haha xx
Where did you get your grey jumper/top from 😍😍
You look so much better with no fake tan on. Lots of love 😙😙😙
I love the way you decorate/ design your rooms😍 I am in love with all your home style 😍😍😍xx
Gabby, please please please get a dietitian, one that specialises in bariatric nutrition. Especially when you will start exercising again. You can't feel healthy and strong not eating enough nutrition. You need more protein too.. I am very concerned. Think about long term effects of being vitamin deficient too. I suffer from b12 deficiencies and am anemic too so I really can understand that feeling exhausted all the time..
Kindly share how much  the stool was?
Gabs, have you gotten your blood sugar levels checked?  I know that you've looked into anemia as a cause of your ailments, but it sounds almost like hypoglycemia or diabetes...get well, love you!!
Hello from Azores Portugal its always very nice watch your videos. Lots of happiness for you🤓
@Gabriella Hey Gabs, a friend of mine who studies biology recently told me that chia seeds have way more iron in them, than spinach does. Maybe that would be a good alternative? And it's super convenient as your can just put some in soy yoghurt, in your drinks, etc. =)
Gabs I honestly relate to your heart to heart.... I have been feeling super shattered. Before I started work I would have to have naps or go to bed before 9pm from doing nothing... now I am in full time employment and I honestly think its affecting my performance, I have no energy. I get home at 7 or 8pm and I am straight to bed. I am also severely anaemic and I have hypothyroidism which affects fatigue.... I finally have a blood test this week. I hope you feel better soon :)
i hope you get sorted at doctors soon, i have anemia and hypothyroid, it can be so debilitating! lots of well wishes xoxoxox
i hope you will be better gabi we love you !!!!!! xx
I love you and hope you keep feeling better and your videos are always so good and make me so happy x
Are your cats neutered? It might reduce the boy
Hi Gab! I was wondering where your grey jumper is from?? I love it :)
I've heard from quite a few people that although spinach is full of iron, it is also home to a chemical (or something) that prevents the iron being fully absorbed. Probably something to look into!
Could you link the glasses please?
Loved it!:) Glad youre vlogging more!:) \nPs can you do an update video on Bean ? I like the name Geremy fitted with him;)! Xxx
try cooking frozen spinach in unsweetened almond milk with a little garlic powder and salt & pepper. It's a really good substitute for creamed spinach! xxx
Have you stopped using uber? X
There are some Palm Leaf roller blinds in next sale that matches (near identical) your large art piece > Black Loreto Palm Leaf Print Roman Blind if you had 3 you could put up in living room windows.
Me 100% with my cats 😂 they are my babies
Love ya gabs but I'm not a cat lover at all. I always have to turn my phone away when u do your close ups and long pauses on your cats. That's how much I like your vlogs!
We have the same toothbrush !! 😂😂💞
Hi! I had the exact same problem as you! i feels really tired and felt sad all the time! And i fide out that I had a low iron level! I could't eat iron tablets som I went to the doctors and they gave me a shot filled with iron and now i feel much better!
I got the glasses video in my sub box!
I feel like gabby one of the only people who don't rip people off with her merch love you gabs❤️
Waaooo good
It breaks my heart to see you cry. Keep your beautiful head up , I love you ❤️
if you blend spinach up in a blender with frozen bananas and cocoa powder it tastes just like a chocolate milkshake and you can't taste the spinach - you should give it a try :)
Hope you feel better soon dear!
Hey gabs I had a question, why don't you drive?✨
I use to get called Velma as well and ugly Betty in high school it put me off wearing my glasses but you look so good in yours
O.M.G I can't believe that Gabby watches Sophie Louise's videos 😁 I'm shook💜
Hey gab, I was thinking maybe you could give Nelly one level of ur house and bean the other, so they both have their own territory. I would hate to see u seperated from bean!
Where is Gabby's fluffy chair from?
I'm glad you found out the reason you're so tired all time. I just came home from a 12-hour blood transfusion because I was severely anaemic too - my iron levels were around a quarter of what they should be and it got to the point where even just standing up wore me out. It's super stressful and scary but it feels so good once it starts getting sorted out and you'll start feeling a lot better emotionally and physically. I don't know if you'll see this or care at all and I don't mean to come across as condescending or know-it-all, but you're not alone and it gets better! Keep being amazing! <3
Anyone wanna help a small YouTuber out?! Currently have 23 amazing subbies ✌🏼😂 x
hey love! Where's your grey jumper from? It's gorgeoussss😍😍❤️
Seriously! How does stuff like this trend?
You're videos always brighten up my day :)
Do the yoga challenge
This is the first time I've watched one of your vlogs & instantly love it!! Subscribed & taggin along for more of your vlogs :) !!! xx
8th on trending! WELL DONE GABS! \nThat's literally so amazing 🤗❤️
I know you've been to the Drs and sorted a few things about but maybe you should consider having a roommate? Someone to support you and socialise with. I hate seeing you so upset because you don't deserve to be like that! You're an amazing person and when I watch your vids/vlogs I have a smile through the whole entire video!💖 Also, loving the Autumnal makeup look!❤️
The thing is you haven't actually donated the money for breast cancer from the ghd' s... you got sent them.
I look forward to the Marc Jacob palettes first impression. They look so gorgeous !
I had the same exact symptoms as you and the same exact diagnosis. It's horrible! I was a zombie for like 4 weeks.
i have pernicious anaemia and I feel like shit all the time. I get an injection every 8 weeks and feel ok for about a week but then I feel shit again. One doctor then diagnosed an underactive thyroid, put me on thyroxine and I started to feel normal. Then another doctor took me off it. I am so frustrated and tired so I feel your pain Gabs and hope you feel much better soon. I feel like women are not taken seriously with issues like this. xx
So sad to see you so upset over your health :( I just had some blood tests back cause I was feeling like you are, and I had bad iron, folate and B12 deficiency, along with some thyroid issues. They put me on iron tablets and i'm on an intensive course of B12 injections of 3 a week for 3 weeks and then one every 3 months. I had my first one yesterday and honestly I feel so much better already! Things will work out and I hope you feel better soon, I know how scary it is! xxxxx
Hi gabs, I hope you're okay it makes me so sad to see you upset I'm keeping up with your insta and snapchat and ovbs YouTube so keep us updated!!! Also I, really loving your jumper where is it from?? All my love xxxxx
Sorry about your anemia, i can sympathize as i had bad anemia too, below 7 whatever that is!! And i remember crying while at work ( dog training) i was so exhausted.. Hope you feel better soon.
That tap clip was really satisfying. I've watched it like 5 times 😂💗

come on kendall u could move whatever u want ...hmmm
A lot of people complaining about the video but everything was on purpose. The song talks about getting to know someone through social media. All the mistery that hides behind someone who you like but you don't know in person. If I could reach and hold your hand I would stands for that feeling of being attracted to someone who you only know by pictures. That's why also Kendall (icon of Instagram) is doing all that egocentric representation of selfies, outfits and mirrors. It all make sense when you think it twice. I think the editing is fun and completely goes with the music. I love it.
The first and the last time i watch this
Boomerang attacked in this vids 😂 but totally great.
visuals  are A1. Not my type of music but I know this would bump for many other people.
Here only for Kendall...
seems like she's back
This video deserve a DISLIKE , fck it gave me headache. the Song is good though
I've Been a fan of fergie since I was little , she's awesome
this makes me feel drunk af
Anyone seen ann margareth of snl? This is the not so funny version.. it gave me headaches 😭😭
One of my faves now! Buying the cd soon!!!!!
i don't know why i hate this song but i still press replay replay and replay xd.
wow this video is bad
Damm, this song is so good and so nostalgic at the same time, I can't explain.
THIS SONG IS FIRE.
This song makes me in a good mood 😊 also, Kendall looks so pretty 💕
so annoying and confusing i had a headache over this!
Fuck i don't know how many times i've seen this, i'm so in love with this song and video i love kendall btw
I am bored just looking at Kendall for some reason, i dont know what it is about her but she bores me. I dont find her interesting, but Fergie i can never get bored looking at. I have never had sexual feelings for a woman before but i would definently go gay for Fergie. And i read she is bisexual. Get out of the way bitches, shes mine. Lol
Kendall is too white for dis
every video editor's nightmare
Terrible, pointless video. In that sense it seems reasonable to have Kendall Jenner... could've done beautiful french imagery... But this is like a really long commercial, for Kendall Jenner. She does not transform into a role... she is just... Kendall Jenner... on high speed. Fail.
This music video is not for epileptic people
I really don't like how the same movement had to be repeated over and over. But the song was good.
Wow ! On repeat ! Love  how she sings in French ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm going to pretend I never saw this video
WAIT...FIRST IT WAS KIM NOW ITS KENDALL MAYBE NEXT WILL BE KYLIE
Why do alot of people hate Kendall??? If I'm being honest, she's one of the few of her family that I like...
I’m a simple man. I see Kendall I click. 🙂
Go up the fuckin stairs!\nJokes aside, the video is bomb💜
Flop
Pamyu.... PonPonPon.... is there no originality anymore?
So iconic😍✨❤

The question is why kendall
What the fuck my eyes
Like mannequin style, but it's like application Boomerang on instagram..
that is an amazing bed!
When Americans speak French..I can't
this video can cause problems especially in epileptic people, I'm not epileptic but I felt my head turn and hammer and now my eyes hurt
I love Kendall but she has 0 carisma
I am just here for Kendall...
this video is annoying as fuck
i got brain damage after watching this vid
The Song‘s really nice but the video is making me fricken aggressive
Can my little beagle have some subs? ☺️
french crowd like: don't cringe challenge
I love this song💋💋
I like the song but the video makes me feel like I'm going to have a seizure
why kendall... she is so overrated
I'm french and I didn't understand what the kid was saying at the beginning of the song, lol.
The video gave me a headache. Thanks
After this video, you're going to need a Pepsi
I click this bcoz of kendall.
Can't stop listening to it
I don't mean to be negative or sound like a dick but I really don't see anything special about Kendall Jenner. Her look in my opinion is extremely average and even boring. Super plain. Just being honest.
She the only classy kardashian \nAnd I like for being different from them
This gives me anxiety and panick attacks
Would bei better with more Jumpcuts
Came here for kendall
My queen kendall
1:20 wtf is she doing? Bad af🤢🤢

All of my friends are settling down\nThey're all kids but they're married now\nLet's follow the lights\nLet's follow the crowd\nBaby we got to get out\nLet's get out of this town\n\nI want an ocean view, somewhere\nAs long as I'm next to you, I don't care\nI don't wanna live my life in circles\nI just wanna find an empty road\nLet's get away form here, let's go\n\nAll of my friends are settling down\nThey're all kids but they're married now\nLet's follow the lights\nLet's follow the crowd\nBaby we got to get out\nLet's get out of this town\n\nNothing ever changes here, I know\nAnother day, another year, same old\nI don't wanna live my life in circles\nI just wanna find an empty road\nLet's get away form here, let's go\n\nAll of my friends are settling down\nThey're all kids but they're married now\nLet's follow the lights\nLet's follow the crowd\nBaby we got to get out\nLet's get out of this town\n\nLet's get out of this town\nLet's get out of this town\nLet's get out of this town\nLet's get out of this town\nLet's get out of this town\nLet's get out of this town

This one along with First Time and Stargazing are the trinity of sensations. What a fantastic job Kygo.
What a song! 😍
Oh yeah!! This is the reason why Kygo inspired me so much! . Someday my music will also be heard! :D someday ...
WTF?! How can he even consider giving Domo away especially for a simple problem that can be solved through  crate training!! ??? I've only had my puppy for 2 months and it was  difficult at first with his training but never in a million years would I give him away !!!
thats so sad that Tim favours chubby over Domo...poor dog.. shouldn't have favourites..
The part when isacc was getting out of the bath and you spoke to him a little different was nice to see because sometimes I feel like I'm too short tempered with my daughter when she isn't listening to me. But I guess it's normal
I don't understand Tim's callousness toward Domo and not wanting to keep him. The accidents in the kitchen are anxiety at being separated from you. It makes me very sad that he would so easily give up a dog he's had for years. I'm so glad Bubz disagrees with him
aww poor domo. if you dont want him ill take him
Isaac has the damn cutest smile I've ever seen in my life
it's kind of sad that Domo gets pushed aside and then blamed for his anxiety problems. Unfortunately I've seen this in far too many families. Please re home him to a good family if you no longer have the time to give him.
May try having her latch on and do a quick switcharoo on her and switch from boob to bottle.
Bubz now u and Tim have Issac and Ayla u should change the opening\nIt'll be so cute to see both son and daughter
Chubbi and Domo are so adorable and as far as I remember Bubz you always said they were your kids... It breaks my heart to know Tim even suggested giving away Domo after seeing how loving you both were to the dogs... dogs are family so why treat them differently? 😢
Oh my goodness, Ayla legit looks exactly the same like Isaac, except.. Ayla do look a little more feminine and her eyes look a little more like Bubz! 💕
Oh my gosh I love your baby
I can understand why people are upset about Domo but people are overreacting with calling him a douchebag...If you've never had a super anxious dog with their little dog quirks and ALSO have to take care of babies with limited sleep, it can be very frustrating and stressful. And people, you need to consider how sanitary that would be with the kids walking and crawling around! What if one day baby Ayla was crawling around and found a dry dingle berry and put it in her mouth?! I wouldn't lie--I'd be kinda pissed. So, I wouldn't believe anyone who didn't at least consider giving their dog away in that type of situation. And just to clarify, I'm not agreeing with giving Domo away, and hope they exhaust all options before such a big decision.. but people need to take a chill pill...Agree to disagree and move on. \n\nAnd Bubz, my Annelise would only take milk from a como tomo 5 oz bottle. Even then, she would take it sometimes and sometimes she would refuse. Eventually she just started to drink it after we kept practicing with her with me away from her...I've heard things like make Tim wear a scarf with your scent and maybe she'll think it's you.. Or you can give her warmed milk instead of room temp milk.
Is it bad, that I want Ayla and Taika (Barts and Geos baby) meet one day once they grow up :D
You should try tommee tippee brand. They say its very close to the feel of a mother's nipple. You just have to find the right flow but it worked for my son.
Bubz try giving Ayla one bottle a day to get her use to taking it, and try different kinds of bottles. My daughter is picky and would only take the mam bottles. She's definitely got better at taking expressed milk when I went back to work but she always prefers the breast over bottle. Hope this helps. 😊💕
please anyone if you know how to solve domo's problem write it in a comment, it would be heart breaking for him
2:20 Isaac looks EXACTLY like Tim it's hilarious
i get headaches from not drying sinc ei was a teen... and white hair ever since i was 14. (turning 22 in nov) QQ
There are more comments about Domo than any advice or tips to help Ayla drink expressed milk.
Hi Lindy.. maybe you can try cup feeding or syringe feeding?
These always make me smile
Perhaps Domo would benefit from a prescription night-time anxiety pill.   I can tell you this:  if you were to get rid of him over this issue, it will haunt you the rest of your life.
You could get a doggy door installed, that way you can lock them downstairs and they can go outside as they wish. Our dog goes outside on his own to relieve himself
My boyfriend is having a similar issue with his dog Jack. He's only almost nine months old but due to work and time he didn't realize how much work it takes to train a dog. Jack kind of goes wherever. I'm hoping to get a spare key so I can take him to dog lessons and even possibly litter box train him since the current living situation makes it difficult for him to go out much. We were late potty training because of the lepto disease going around so we kept him indoors. Any tips from anyone would help as well!
Maybe it would be a good idea to crate them at night so they can't run around at night
For the potty training stuff for domo, I would suggest closing off a smaller area for them to sleep. If the area is too big, they feel more comfortable pooping everywhere. Also, try to make them poop at night before bed. Just have them leashed and don't go inside until they poop and just make this a routine
The dogs are not neglected ... Why? Because we don't see it in her vlogs. Behind the camera they are  loved and cared for ,most dogs don't get the privilege to sleep or live inside a warm or cool home. Other dogs with  Domo current situation would probably be thrown outside by their owners. So at the end of the day we all know that Domo won't be given away, because he's Alya and Isaacs big brother >.<! 
our dog also started pooping inside when we put up a lil gate to keep her from going upstairs. Still rebelling at her old age
Bubz, buy a couple of different branded bottles and try those. Just buy a single of each or the smallest number pack so you don't waste too much money, but often they don't take to certain brands because of the shape etc. There's a brand advertised on Facebook a lot called Minbie which has a unique shaped teat and has brilliant reviews from mums in your situation where baby wouldn't take a bottle at all and it's worked for them. But I imagine they're more expensive so try shop brought brands first :) xo
From a mum of a 3 month old: I express in the mornings at 5am. If you're up anyways try pumping your breast milk into bottles and have her bottle feed at least once a day. She will get used to it. Also try using different brands of bottles/teats as some babies can be more picky than others. Xx
How month old is baby ayla?
i havent really noticed the reality of bub's height until i saw her with that stroller o.o
You should put isaac in swimming lessons!
Omg.... I love those cheeks!  Remind me of my daughter when she was a newborn....
she doesn't want the bottle because she's used to your boob.  The way they suck the nipple is different than the bottle nipple, so it probably frustrates and confuses her.  if you're going to do the bottle, then try sticking to the bottle only because going back and forth confuses them.  and hopefully.... she'll get used to the bottle nipple... good luck.
I rmb when I tried to give bottle to my daughter, I kind of fooled her into it. \nI would put her all set up in my breastfeeding position, pull out my boob, as she's about to latch on I put the bottle right there for her. from then on she was fine with bottle lol.
Make sure that the bottle nipple has the same shape and resistance as your nipple has she will take it better.
My daughter is exclusively breastfed and will only take a medela bottle I would try warming up the expressed milk with the nipple being warm my daughter was extremely picky about the temperature of the expressed milk and would only drink it if it was warm. I would also try pace feeding when bottle feeding it really worked well for my family and we introduced the bottle as soon as 5 day she will only take breast from me but takes the bottle with everyone else. I would also see if Tim can place a clothing item which smells like you when giving the bottle that may help also which could lay on his shoulder. I went back to work full time when my daughter was 10.5 weeks old she still favors the breast when I'm home but always will take the bottle of my expressed milk when I'm away.
Bubz you should train Domo to use the toilet!
Domo seems depressed and stressed because he isnt allowed to sleep with his owners. I dont mean to sound rude but thats most likely why hes been pooping all over the house. Thats why I dont allow my pets to sleep on the bed or in the room with me. They have their own little beds in the living room, maybe even try crate training him? I used to keep mine in a crate at night, it worked for me and my family.
Hey Bubz! I know you get a lot of comments, but I hope you read this one. Maybe you should think about putting Domo in a crate for the night. Dogs instinctively don't want to pee/poo where they sleep, so they will hold it until they are let out. He seems to me to be emotionally stressed because of the changes in the house, and letting him just downstairs gives him enough room to do what I like to call protest poos. I know it won't help with the stress, but it might save you from having to pick up poo every morning!
My baby is three months and is having an issue with taking the bottle as well. I noticed that when I hold him he refuses it but if I prop him on his Boppy and give it to him while he is on it, he takes it! I think that he associates me holding him with breastfeeding!
What if you put him in a kennel at night
OMG there the cuttest kids i have ever seen!!!
wait, what happens if Ayla wants to play with it in the future ? or u guys just dismantal the toy house and put the thing away? I know it's kinda not my biuness but it its a thought though.
your videos always cheer me up when i’m having a hard day!
I know the dogs can't sleep with you but what about if they slept with Isaac? It could possibly calm Domo's nerves. That or crate train him
8:42 at first i thought someone was bareass naked on your bed.... assumed it was Ayla. But just turns out to be your calves.
I think I've been watching bubzvlogz videos since 2014. It was in that year that I discovered that I had anxiety and depression, I had a hard time leaving home and ended up stopping my life for a year. The videos of this family were one of the forces that encouraged me to fight against my negative thoughts because I wanted to have a family like theirs. I remember how the dogs were clinging to both of them, and seeing Dommo that way makes me very sad. Of course, Tim and Lindy have two kids and that totally changes the dynamics of the house but hearing what Tim said broke my heart. I hope they can find a solution and that Dommo can overcome their anxiety! <3
As a mom that breastfed her babies, the advice I have is if you are going to give her milk using the bottles don't try to do so when you are around.  The baby smells you and she will refuse the bottles.  If that still doesn't work try using different types of bottle nipples until you find the one she likes (look for some that mimics the shape of yours). Good luck!
I just watched the first few seconds...and omg she is so freaking cute!! 😍
I haven't watched bubs in about 2 years omg!!!
You know what worse is a kid doesn't want play with toy. I can't buy anything toy for my nephew
Hey Lindy, how did you train your dogs? I'm thinking of getting a puppy, it will be my first time xD
She is so chunky! So adorable!
Couldn't believe tim actually suggested that. Disgusted by his act seriously. To human, dog is always a dog. But did u even realize in dog's eyes, owner is their only family members? Don't get a dog if you can't give them 100% life time commitment. Their  life is very short anyway. Get a solution rather than just simply saying giving it away. Been following bubz for many years until today dis really made me pissed off. Not gonna subscribe anymore. Really disappointed.
I really hate people who even think to give their dog away. Just lost my respect for Tim.\nI’ll have to unsubscribe,i’m sorry.\nBut I can’t stand people like that...
Don't give your dog away. Rescue is full of abandoned dogs as it is. He has separation anxiety. Let him back in your bedroom or get help
Domo looks so sad :( \nDomo was such a good big bro to Issac when Issac was a baby.  Please don't give up on him.
Domo just misses the way things were poor dog.
Dear bubz, your family has grown and expanded, so u are in dire need of a new intro. Also, you live on a different continent.
Legit thought your legs at the end was Isaac's bum for a second there!
Hearing that someone wants to get rid of a pet just because they're not acting perfect is seriously the saddest thing ever. I couldn't enjoy the rest of the vlog after hearing that. I never thought Tim could be that kind of a person..
I get why Bubz is so frustrated with her dog. She has a child and an infant and isn't sleeping much and all her patience is going to her kids. Now a dog that was trained to go poo in the proper place is having accidents every day. I have been there Bubz, hang in there. Sending your family love and hope people's suggestions help. :)  \nP.S. You guys make adorable babies!
WHY DOES YOUR INTRO HAVE TO BE SO LOUD
No... I'm not gonna say it...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHE NEED SOME MILK!!
My dog had the same problem when she was slowly passing away, couldn't hold her bladder or bowels any longer. So we found a solution that worked with her and my other dog, he was a pup at the time and it really trained them both fast. It is a scented mat that you place anywhere in your home on the floor, and the dog will go straight to it and should do his business on that. It saves a lot of money getting a dog trainer in, we used to get ours in any pet store for under £5, usually went to a poundland, you'll get about 5 in a pack.

Maybe you can try sending the dogs to doggie day camp or having a walker come by to take the dogs for longer, more active walks? I've been a dog walker for 5 years and I've always noticed that more high strung dogs are able to get redirect anxious energy so you will probably find him less likely to poop in the house🐕🐾
For Domo, I would advise a vet who is also an ethology expert, they are experts on animal behaviour and are able to solve these problems in a kind way that can be long term solutions.
You're such a good mum!! 😭
I know that pool! Been years since I have been. The slides scare me and being in a swimsuit is not enjoyable.\n\nAyla so chubby and cute.
We used NUK bottles. They have a more “nipple” look in my opinion and my little one took it. He was extremely picky about boob feeding, but he would take those in a pinch.
Where is the penguin Issiac carries around from ???
MY BOTTLE FEEDING ADVICE \n\nTry:\n\nHolding the bottle with thumb and index finger while having the middle finger resting either on her cheek or chin, which ever feels comfortable to give her a similar feeling of what she feels when being nursed.\n\nHolding bottle at different degrees, nipple of bottle has to reach/touch her comfort spot
Try different type of bottle like como tomo bottles work for us my son is almost two weeks younger than ayla
I LOVE your new stroller but they're so expensive!!!
If u wana get Lala on bottle, try the Japanese brand Pigeon, they have regular bottle or wide mouth bottle. 80% of my friends has changed to Pigeon bottles coz babies won't take Avent or other brand. My 3m old son been using Pigeon for my expressed milk since 3weeks old. Regular teak is longer than wide mouth teak, so just need to figure out which is better! good luck!
I wonder if Bubz's kids would have a better grasp at language at an earlier age just because she often speaks to video camera in front of them :D
I really Hope Tim was joking when he said he would gove Domo away, or at least regret what he said. Domo is just feeling like he's not as loved as he is used to. If you give him away he will feel even worst! I understand have 2 kids now they would have less time for their dogs but giving Domo away is not the answer here..
My first son also refused the bottle, my mom syringe fed him, just putting drops on the tongue, also spoon feedings works the same way. I only suggest this for small amounts like 30ml. Family can also try sneaking a bottle feeding when baby is still half asleep. Have them use one of your worn shirts (mommy smell) when they feed her.
Try Kiinde Bottles!! Our son is breastfed and he will take them! They have been a life saver!
she is aging really poorly. and using your own children as a money making machine is just really messed up.
The way she grabs him by them cheeks......
Try a different nipple on the bottle!
I love your kids, but to be honest I really missed all the vlogs with the dogs :(
I think Domo feels rejected and there's no love anymore if you keep yelling at him and are guys sure cubbie don't poo anywhere as well to and you blaming Domo?
PLease don't give domo away. It breaks my heart !
Re-do intro time! 💘💘💘💘
Shes so cute
Awwww, Ayla looks so much like Granny Bubz.
I miss you guys alreadyy :(((
Ayla looks like Granny Bubz xD
I just wanna squeeze Ayala's chubby cheeks she's so adorable 😭😭😂
Poor Domo. He probably feels unwanted. Animals do sense our vibes.
feel bad for Domo.
Omg your baby is adorable
Don't give away Domo!!!
AWWW
Who else actually lives in Isle of Dogs
What Marble Wolf says.\n\nPlus, it's great to see a movie that doesn't portray Japan as some sort of utopian, morally perfect weaboo paradise.
Isle Of Dogs.....I Love Dogs....I see what he did here. Catchy.
The premise of this movie does not make sense. Quarantine dogs in a landfill? To avoid the dog flu?? Am I missing something here?? It s Wes A. movie..sign me in!🤣😂😅🤧🤒😷😷
This looks terrifying to me.
This looks spectacular, I love Wes Anderson movies so much!
What a cheaply made movie
I know what there doing
I read a book kinda like this
Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of my favorite movies. Super excited to see something from this director that looks original.
Going out on a limb, but I think Chief may be spot\n\nHear me out, he has a similar facial structure, striking blue eyes, and I see little tufts of white in his fur
Just the movie I've needed! Wes is amazing.
Whoa. Big screen fo sho. i will go to movies for this.
song at 1:08 is I Won't Hurt You by the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band
Me:yah, the movie is going to su-\n\n\n:gets flashbacks of Fantastic Mr. Fox:\n\n\n\n\nMe:HOLLY CRAP
what the music in the trailer called
I will watch anything Wes Anderson makes.
As usual the cast is amazing. I'm missing the pastel colors tho.
OMG!! I want to watch this so badly!! This movie has everything I love: dogs, stop motion animation, japanese culture, futuristic adventures and finally, directed by Wes Anderson.
The Mr. Fantastic Fox is my favorite movie and im pretty sure those people made this. I WILL watch this.
I need to see this . I loved fantastic mr fox
I might be the only one but I don't think I'd really like to see this movie?\nIt looks alright I guess (I've never really been one for stop motion) and I do really like the concept, but... eh? No offense of course!\nIt's probably just because there are other movies coming out I'm more interested in :0
Can I watch it n ow
This is gonna be amazing god I can't wait.
Anyone know the song at 1:19
The first song is called Lieutenant Kijé, Op. 60, IV. Troika, by Sergei Prokofiev.
Did the people behind Fantastic Mr. Fox make this?
Isle of dogs depicts a war between usa and north korea nuclear bomb...read between the lines
HOLY SHIT A GOOD ANIMATED MOVIE!!
I need this in my life
This looks hilarious. I'm definitely watching this when it comes out.
That little boy would die cause of the dog flu they are there for a reason
What is it rated
Wow, i wanna see this so bad, the voices of the dogs have me soo excited!
i dont know why but its seems sooo fking creepy to me... xD
If it was Isle of Old Yellers they'd be dead by now.
I really hope people go see this. Mainly the mainstream audiences. We ask for new original movies and when one comes along, no one goes sees it. Hope this movie does well
THIS IS JUST PERFECT!! WES! YOU ARE MAKING MY DREAMS COME TRUE!
In the first couple seconds, I was like, IS THIS WES ANDERSON??\nAfter Fantastic Mr. Fox, I'm excited to see what he does with this one. It looks amazing already. :D
I love dogs. To this movie I say, thanks but no thanks.
Oh, looks good, weird, but good!! Looks like a Oscar's animation. I will watch!
This feels like it has the same humor as fantastic mr fox
Heyyy\nThat's a pretty good trailer
I originally saw this trailer as an advertisement before a video I was going to watch.  Typically, I am that guy who has the mouse hovering over the SKIP IN 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... button.  This time was no different.  The only difference is, this trailer caught my attention in that 5 second period.  Not only did I watch the entire trailer, I actually looked it up, so I could watch it, again.  Yeah, I am definitely watching this movie!
Can't wait!!! (And can't wait for ready player one)
For the first time in 5 years, there's a movie I want to see.
First Early Man from Aardman, now THIS. 2018 is going to be KICK ASS for stop motion.\n\nThey need to a limited re-release for Fantastic Mr. Fox before this opens.
Honestly I get annoyed by Anderson's obsessive use of 90 degree shots, but I can't deny how charming his movies are.
The only stop motion movie I've loved so far is Kubo and the two strings. Hopefully this is good too
This looks like a parody of a typical Wes Anderson indy film...
YES YES I WANT THIS GIVE IT TO ME NOW I WANT IT I WANT IT GIVE IT NOW NOW I WANT IT
Why do everyone talk like they're in a 12 oz mouse episode!? XD
This reminds me of Fantastic Mr. Fox\n\nOh wait it is made by the same director.
what?! I gotta wait till March...2018!!!!! That is just such a mean thing to do.I'm 54 and i drink too much, have a heart.D
This movie is like a pug.  Ugly, but in the most charming way that you can't resist.
This movie concept style is amazing I love it. Since Wes Anderson created this style is awesome thats why I will always love this movies, now I like Fantastic Mr Fox and the Isle of the Dogs. P.S. It would have been great to have a sequel to the Fantastic Mr Fox too BTW. This types of movie  will always watch them and  love them.
The public has been begging for something original.  I think this is it.
I'm a cat person but I can't wait to see this movie! It looks very well made and the story is interesting
this is made by the same guy who made fantastic mr fox IM DEFINITLY CHECKING THIS OUT!!!!!!!!
Wow I can't wait
Looks like an inie film but its wes anderson..
I'm gonna watch the shit out of this just like how I've been watching the shit out of Fantastic Mr Fox for the past century
this is so weird I'm into it
I came here just to comment on their leader being Kobayashi\nlike... you know... the Dragon maid anime....
Where I come from we just cut their balls off to stop them from overpopulating
dropped everything to watch this tbh
this is a weird looking film but at the same time its so heartwarming to see the lengths a boy will go to just to get his dog back.
Fking OATH! I loved Fantastic Mr. Fox and this is looking just as good
This is Fox, it is Fake News!!!
in wes anderson we trust
I love you, wes
The song is The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band - I Won't Hurt You\n- I think we have a chance to make this a kind of life changing experience and I think we need it
I have watched this waaaay to many times, it's so good
1:06 That blonde haired afro girl said I've got a crush on you.
ok people we weren't there for mr fox but here is our chance.
Wes Anderson is a master at making movies. I'm definitely seeing this!
Does anyone know the name of the slower song? I've lost all my pride...? It sounds like Ally Kerr though it's probably not
Love this already!
Isle of man
wait what???~?!?!?!?!?!?!?
I'm so cussing excited
it reminds me of fantastic mr.fox  looks fucking awesome
a must see
I love Wes Anderson
OHHH WES
Wes Anderson is god.
Sorry bud your dog was eaten
I hope this will be on Netflix.
Fantastic mr fox 2.    Fantastic Mr Dog
looks good
Dat cast tho....
Certainly a unique director.
Song?
Plague Dog vibes?
Chief is my giant schnauzer named CHIEFTAIN ;)
This looks creepy as
Kobayashi dog maids
Proof that Wes Anderson still believes that talking animals are still more plausible than black people
Scarlett johansen don't learn do she?
Looking good. I like that the dogs talking english can be summed up to them just speaking dog instead of japanese.
now its time to taste some spaghetti tacos
i swear this entire video is this chick trying to drill into our heads that she is a WORKING PARENT LIKE MYSELF, we get it, you think you work hard
Me: Can I have a phone with unlimited data?\nMom: The answer is still No. \nMe: Fml ._.
I wish my mom had blue hair
Half the comments are just about spaghetti tacos
she's just holding her coffee the whole time
Why dont you try saying no for a day not a week
me: *figures out my mum's saying Tess to anything* mummmmm...can I have a puppy?
My mum only says no, and always goes through my phone and personal belongings.
If this happened to me Ummm can I get this custom 20000 dollar pc
Me: mum can I have 1 thousand dollars \n\nMum: .....yes?
85 DEGREES? YOU ARE COOKING YOU-\n\n\nOh. Fahrenheit. Americans.
A buzzfeed video that wasn't cancerous
85 is nothing I live in like 100
85 degrees is hot no you don't know heat until you've been to Texas or Arizona
this is an overexagerated video
Gentle parent where was that when I was 4 I got beat for asking what was for dinner
Before watching the video I can tell you that this is bad parenting.
85 degrees!?!?!? Here in Texas that's perfect!!!!!!
I feel like Buzzfeed would be a cool place to take your kids to work! Everyone justs wants to play with the kids :)
I never get anything
Haha imagine the kids asking can we go visit Australia?
Mom can I quit school forever
85 degrees bish it's 105 in Arizona I swear people these days🙄🙄
If my parents did that.... lets just say their bank account will have no money
These kids must watch ICarly with the spaghetti tacos
Spaghetti tacos done with corn tortilla are actually a thing in Mexico and delicious!
Baby: can I get a dildo\n\nMom: YESSSS
They should've took advantage of her ad when to Disneyland 😂😂
Super cute video!! Anything potty training next would be great! Hahah
Mom, can I get the Iphone X?\nMom, can I get 500 dollars worth of pants from hollister?\nMom, can I get some yeezys?\nMom, can I watch American Assassin everyday at the 10 dollar movie theater? \nMom, can you stop calling my name every 5 seconds?
when she has her sun glasses on she looked like my year 5 teacher without the blueish dye
Can i stay home and not go to school for 5 years
Went to my friends house yesterday know what we ate\nFricken spaghetti tacos

Mom can i not go to school for the next week?
Spaghetti tacos are the best!! I love them! I've had them since iCarly lol 💕
It looks like she's gunna cry
you cant do this challenge with a functioning happy family
I hope I find a wife like you.
This is so sweet I'm crying
She seems like a very sweet mother
85 degrees, that's normal weather.
What if he asked if he could drive the car XD
I would get a gtx 1080 sli rgb desktop, 8 4k monitors, monitor stands, razer keyboard and mouse. All headsets ever, and every game I want on steam.
I would ask for McDonalds
I want my parents to do this.
There was a condom ad before this video.
My mom says me and my siblings are the worst kids =~=
My mom yelled at me for dropping a toilet paper roll
*One Word.*\n\n\n\nyou though i was gunna type something lmao
I love that she's had the coffee in her hand the whole time😂😂😂😂😂😂
If my mom did this i would say to give me a new phone, money , and quit school😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂lmao
85 degrees? Where I live it's 100+ and I'm still wearin a jacket.
WE NEED A SERIES OF THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!
“They asked if we could sit and watch Adventure Time”\n\n...\nYour kids are my new bffs
This lady seems like such a nice down to earth person
Mum can u give me you money and house
I never heard my mom say no 😂😂
You sound shaky like it scared you like you have uh mental issues from it
you're such an amazing mom <3\n(with or without the yes challenge)
My kids asked me to play with them so I said yes, because I had to.\n\n-_-
Mom, can you buy me a Lambo, and a brand new Rolex?
The best day ever?\n*The Best Day Ever* \n*Bam...Scores on him*
This video is so pure 😍
Oh wow 85 degrees? Where I live the average is 95-100 so calm down.
Not only was this video cute, but it inspired me to go get some spaghetti tacos
Not saying No does not mean you have to say yes to every thing...lol
85 degrees is a blessing from the heavens. I'm from Texas.
“Jackson’s melting down, Wyatt’s melting down, I’m melting down. Lol😂😂
Kids:Can i have *** with you \nMom: yes
If dis was my mom I would ask her for pairs of Jordans 💀
Those kids are so dang smart. SPAGHETTI TACOS. I'm gonna eat that all the time from now on.
Its good to say no to a child. It teaches them boundaries and consciousness.
You know they don't live in Texas or Arizona if 85 degrees is alot to them...
Kids: can I get Pony,Xbox one and iPhone 8 and 10Mom: yes
Mom i wanta iphone x,pocket bike, dirt bike, ps4,xbox one x and more stuff
I’m trying to convince my mom to say yes for a day, but in return she wants me to say Yes 1 day as well, and that means “Massages, Cleaning, CHORES!” I hope I can still go to Wonderland by convincing my mother.
when she said 85 degrees i live in tx so i was just like o that sounds nice
My mom can't even say yes one a day but she says yes if I can stop talking like if this is your mom
Yo ma ps4?\n-yes\nYo ma iphone x\n-yes\nYo ma bj?\n-.....
So this is clickbait

Hey
The quirk also pokes his girlfriend on Facebook ( Alex wasabi)
Really
Hi happy birthday 🎂🎈
Let’s relate I’m send this to them
Clara is an amazing interviewer, Always really knows the projects of the person she interviews, genuinely cares about their answers and doesn't make anything awkward or cross lines by asking things too personal. :) loved this
I feel bad I stole a lil episode - Jay Z on Game Of Thrones
Jay Z — I have no idea what that show is \nJay Z — I think I've been on that show, yeah, yeah
I really love Clara, she always listens so intently and is so keen, she obviously does her research and gets personally close to the music beforehand and has relevant, interesting questions. Love seeing these interviews!
I'm a fan of Jay Z, and i must admit this interview was great, wasn't just about music but also talks about the other Shawn Carter. Flexible interview well done
This girl is good well done Clara
I think Jay is finally being the artist he’s always wanted to be. He’s clearly stated in his music that he sold out and made pop records on purpose. “I sold 5 mil and ain’t been rhyming like common sense” I know it’s early but this album will be looked at as another classic in his catalog.
Jay-Z bought a lot of project buildings around Brooklyn just to give back to his neighborhood and the rental rates are much lower than the government rates. He doesn't make any money out of it after all costs but it's simply a caring gesture for his community.
I meant to give it a quick scan, ended up watching the whole thing. Clara is expert at this.
We won't see another interview with Hov in a long time. Appreciate this one! The greatest of all time Jiggaman Jay HOVA!
Give the man a glass of water he keeps apologizing about his voice...
Y'all think small I think BIGGIE
We can't afford any mistakes at this point
These streets school us to spend our money foolish.
Jay has a mystique around him where people like to reach for the deeper meaning in every little thing. A lot of artists have put out thoughtful material inspired by their personal experiences. I like that Jay did it too but 4:44 is not that extraordinary.
Have so much respect for this man as a musician and person...great interview.
Sign says stay away fools cause love rules at the loveeee shack

After ducking and covering non stop  for this subject matter so many time now that all these other major black people said shit now he speaks?
On game of thrones: What you want me to do People bootlegged  my albums😂😂
jay z is like damn near 50 i can say whatever i want!
Jay talking about Ye at the end
WHAT ARE YOU DOING !! \n\n\n\n\nPUT 4:44 ON SPOTIFY
👁👁These are my eyes and I want you to know they take the same prescription of life yours take Mrs.JAY-Z. I stand with you still giving the ratings to the show's and even being linked to everyone in the world. I think your hat even had a message for consumers to understand more of the paper plane logo which is he who represents is The Family. Yo Mrs.JAY-Z a.ka Brown since Ms.Blue is Blue how many karats is your heart because that thing beating inside you was specially made by God #JiggaMyNigga #JiggaMyBrother #RocNation #HovKnowsALargePartOfKnow
I have to make my way to London.
Who's this black goddess
shut up and take these beats jigga
15:25 Have you got anything written down?\n\nJay : ..... Did it all without a pen... saw that one comin' but had to remind y'all again
Jay is so sweet
Dude reminds me of myself. Just super laid back.
I love a good interviewer. Makes it interesting. Jay Z is one of the greatest/smartest rappers of all time.
Her skin is glowing!!!!!!! Radiant as fuck! Beautiful!!!
Can't believe he declined to perform at the SuperBowl, I always envisioned him doing that.
Is Jay-Z doing a duet with Angie Stone?
I always admired Jay, he knows how to make hits and speak wisdom in his music and during the course of an interview.
Love the hair glad I'm not the only afro lover
Ego yeah all you fools feeding into satan spawn, this guy is a Freemason and part of mind control with crap that coming out music industry! Don't touch real artists like Marley Hendrix. Bb king Dylan Clapton. Just a piss take with and samples other tunes. BLM BLACK ON BLACK CRIME IS BLM FOR YOU and black always resist most of time are thugs anyway. All bunch of pricks to me.
Yoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!\nI LOOOOOVE that Jay-Z watched the leaked GOT episode like the rest of us!
definitely you can see the condensed jay z...
Peace in the name of Christ. Somebody please get the following short vid in front of Jay Z: https://youtu.be/pFb0Xu2xJYg
I figured he was still working #noHaircut = #AlbumMode
Yeah... lol this is a sophisticated person that I want my 6 year old listening to...\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=jay+z+middle+finger&client=ms-android-att-us&prmd=ivn&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjkqMPS-rrWAhUM4SYKHf83CUMQ_AUIESgB&biw=412&bih=652&dpr=3.5
this was wrong that was wrong let's move own
Capitalism and freedom read the 📚book
...what do you want me to do, people bootleg my album :) :) HOV on that Game of Thrones! clap clap clap
Wonderful interview. I have so much respect and admiration for Jay.
Keep doing what you're doing Jay Z. Many have so much opinion about what you are and what you are doing.  Until you are no longer here only then will the world and us as a people ( black ) overstand your importance. \nPeace my brother
Some people are just made perfect, example jay z
When things are darkest, light is on it’s way.
Im so glad that they used a reg title and not a headline title
He says mask off lol
Still nigga

Great interview. Well done Clara!!
2027
He is here to be on the right side yet rapped at a Hillary Clinton campaign, errrr ok Jay, obviously doesn't know much about the Clinton Foundation, background and crimes!\nAnd then basically says its ok to rob people with mansions, so next time anyone sees Jay its ok to rob him, what a moron!
If I had a £1 for every time this twat mentioned the word life I'd be a fucking rich lad!!
14:47 I'm surprised all of you sheep didn't catch that. Well..actually, I'm not surprised. He's trying to justify a burglary. If I'm being oppressed and you have this big nice mansion with all of this, I'm coming inside there. That's gonna happen, that's just how life is.\n\nI have a better idea Jay Z, let's break in to your home, rob, and beat your ass because as you like to put it..that's just how life is..........smfh.
Mr potato  head
Sort your fucking hair out you dumb ass licking bitch.
Someone want to tell this idiot to take that hat off logo is so dead
This guy has respect for a mass child murderer named Barack Obama. How are we supposed to take these ignorant Coons seriously when their morality is based strictly on convenience. Donald Trump's a scumbag just like every other president. They drop thousands of bombs on  people all over the world murdering all kinds of innocent civilians for wealth and power. Obama government overthrew the democratically elected president of Honduras soon after he was elected. He overthrew Gaddafi in Libya thereby causing the genocide of tens of thousands of black libyans and precipitating a slave trade of black Africans in Libya but Jay-Z respects Obama and does not respect Trump. No doubt Trump will commit his own crimes against humanity but as of yet he's perpetrated nowhere near the evil that Obama, Bush, Clinton, Bush, Reagan Etc. all perpetrated. This just shows how ignorant Jay-Z is along with most people in this world period mass murder is normal and acceptable and you can be a respectable human being even though you a mass murderer. To be so devoid of any awareness of the sheer extent of suffering and anguish and pain that his friend Obama caused all over the world is quite frankly sickening and putrid.
All U pervert guys luv him\nHe sold his soul to d devil and he got twins this was done by the Satanic ritual\nHis a devil\nSatan worshipper facts
Can't concentrate when this guy talks.
illuminati and the bbc go hand in hand
I'm guessing Hov was here for the Basquiat exhibition.
I'm telling this for just to people know that this guy may look like humble and shit in front of camera and shit but he isn't this deep shit is a pedophile, satanist and a part of that illuminati shit... some people may not believe I will tell them to look things up..
They say if you love it you should let it out its cage & fuck it if it comes back you know its here to stay👀
obama ass licker
Hes fucking adorable
Fuck Jay Z- Ether Voice.

I just realised I've never actually seen what Clara Amfo looks like. I can now categorically say she looks as annoying as she sounds.
Chipmunk cheek asshole
4:44 is 666 upside down
j-z do you have any guilt for selling poison to your people?
Damn that black bitch is ugly as hell !
She must use a lot of cream for her dry skin and that hair wow how bad must some1 feel with hair like that
jay z you're a legend but please stop talking bout politics cuz you know shit
I know I'm all disgusting and lovey dovey but gimme a break HE'S THE CHANDLER TO MY MONICA, PEOPLE! Also I just wanna say - *TRIGGER WARNING* for a section in this video discussing sexual assault, something discussed in my book...as soon as I get asked about what was the hardest thing to write about maybe skip ahead if you don't want to hear about that kind of stuff. Really missed you guys, thanks for dealing with less videos for a while as I worked on the short film and got through the book launch and then went on my holidays! BACK BABY xxx
I would 100% love a video about intuitive eating! I'm also really bad at distinguishing 'good' foods from 'bad' ones, so if you could maybe do a little section on that, on how to figure out what's good to fuel your body and what's not (obviously I know fast food and sweets etc aren't great, but there are some more confusing 'grey' areas that I'm having trouble with - sometimes something that seems healthy isn't, that sort of thing), that would be lovely too. :-) I also want to say that you are so brave for opening up, both in this video and your book. You're truly an inspiration.
Always enjoy your videos.  Is your book released in Canada?
Do a video of your favorite books lately!!!!!
You're such a beautiful and inspirational person Melanie. I just got back from holiday where I read your book and you really touched on a lot of subjects that I believe will help a LOT of people. You're the only YouTuber I feel like I know. You're like the lovely big sister I never had haha 😆 And I'm really happy to see you so happy in life, and so confident and beautiful! Keep it up, we're all rooting for you 💚
You're so bubbly it's adorable :D <3 Also he's a cutie :D
Fantasies and fetishes are fine simply because they are consensual. I just wanted to say that because it seemed like you felt you had to disclaimer that. What happened to you was assault and the people that did that are disgusting.
When u said like “I maybe want to explore like eroticism” I replayed that so many times to make sure YES MEL FECKIN HELL PLEASE😂💚
would you please do a video on how to determine whether you are hungry or not. It is something that I struggle with and I'm sure would help lots of people
Anyone else still waiting for Melanie's book in the mail? I ordered from Amazon UK, I'm in BC Canada, and have been waiting for over a month now. :'(\nI'm really excited for merch and short film\nThat last answer tho <3
Haha, you've definitely been spending time with SOMEONE with a heavier accent than you... sounds adorable xx
That was hard to listen to cause something happened to me but im amazed at you talking about it its so brave xx
I have pre-ordered your book but it's not out til November in Canada. Wanted to bring it to meet you when you come to Toronto for the awards this weekend! I'm so happy you're doing so well with the book and in your life! :)
@Iveta J I know what she said and I disagreed. Describing someone's nationality is the same as describing someone's looks. I got molested by a bald Moroccan (yes this actually happened). I can't describe him in another way. It is the way it is. His looks in no way reflects on other bald and/or Moroccan men. Just like when some people with my nationality do something bad in another country it doesn't reflect on me. I think it's selfish to ask for a detail not to be told because it makes you feel uncomfortable.
Your man is gorgeous and I hope you two are successful together and happy.  Also, thank you so much for keeping the questions up on the video as you're talking about them, so many youtubers lack to do this, and it's very helpful and a great but simple thing. I cannot wait to buy your book when i can!
I'm so happy for you Melanie! I've been your subscriber for many years and it's as if I've followed your journey. I hope for many more great things to come in your life!

Melanie why don't u do some asmr videos you'd be brilliant
Really loved this video. Please do a longer video about the food stuff xx
Sooo glad you're back ! I got stuck watching your videos all summer long, they're amaaazing. I'm a med school student so I get very stressed and you have the power to make me fell more relaxed when I watch you so thank you so much ! \nI especially love your Food Diary Fridays, they're really relatable compared to most days of eating videos, I love them. \nAlso I love your accent.\nAlso are you gonna do Vlogmas this year cause that would really make me very very happy!\nAlso I love your videos did I mention that ? \nSorry for all the questions, and thank you again you're an amazing human being Melanie Murphy :)
I'm so happy that you've found someone who makes you super happy! I'm in a new relationship and he doesn't live abroad but he's currently lives 2 hours away from me since he's studying up in Dundee and I'm still in Glasgow so we don't get to see each other as often as we'd like. But he made the point that in not seeing each other as often it makes us appreciate the time that we do spend together. We try and see it as more a positive thing than a negative!
I have responses to two questions:\nVixey's question - I'm curious as to whether or not she has self-diagnosed or has actually gotten professional help to give her the diagnosis. Or, if she's asking for a friend, the same applies; treatment is always an ongoing relationship between a professional and yourself. If an individual could treat themselves at home for psychiatric illnesses/mental health disorders than we would not need professionals in that area in the health field/it wouldn't be a disorder in the first place. The number 1 criteria for any psychiatric illness is does it interfere with daily life and if the answer is yes than it is quite clear you are unable to deal with it on your own.\n\nLucia's question - Make your own self goals with your body; it's *your* body, *your* goals. *Your* body will NEVER be someone else's body (ie. a celebrity's body, a friend's body, or the ex of your current partner's body) so their bodies should never be the goal nor WILL they ever be obtainable. Set goals for yourself, and take complements in a way that fuels your goal. Any other comments don't matter. Think of it like any other goal - say your goal was to keep your car's gas tank above the empty line, getting comments on how your car looks or what you could do to make it look better has nothing to do with your goal of keeping the tank full, so although they are compliments they have nothing to do with what you want to achieve so you say thank you and move on. You feel better knowing yourself that you have kept your tank above the empty line for a period of time that was longer than the last time you drove on empty - you wouldn't necessarily brag about this feat but it makes you feel good and pushes you to other goals like keeping your gas tank above the 1/4 line.
Your book has FREE. WORLDWIDE. SHIPPING?!!??!?! How are you so amazing?!!
young adult/adult fantasy is my favorite genre and id love to read what you have to share!
I can so relate to the last answer. Damn, everytime my life is going well, I image it getting worse again and I'm fearing that. But then I can't enjoy the happy life right now. So I try to just not worry and accept, that someday, it might change, but that is normal, too. I'm going to get out of this again :3
wow Melanie that was tough to talk about your sexual assault but i really admire you for discussing it x
You totally lit up when you were talking about your bf - I found myself smiling at the screen too! Happy for you :)
I'd love a whole video about intuitional eating! Love your chit chat stuff you give great advice and its always really down to earth and honest
Writte a ya in college or after college time, im tired of high School love histories
Literally screamed when you talk about your new love!!!! 💕💕💕💕💕💕
I'm sorry to say everyone is capable of terrible acts
Melanie you are such an amazing person xxxx
That accent gives me life
I'm all in for the scifi/fantasy novel!! :D Glad you are happy! :)
I love your accent. I don't know why. But if I can't sleep. I watch your videos.
If you decide to write sexy bisexual romance, let me know. That, after all, is how I make my living and I can shorten the journey for you. :-)
Oh my gosh im smiling so much after this vid!!! I'm so happy for you mel!
SO pleased for you and your new relationship Mel. You deserve to be happy and you never have to apologise for that. I'm sure he's a fantastic guy! 💚💚💚💚
I really found you at the perfect time in my life, a few months ago in the throws of my ED, and self discovery. This was great, love your channel
Pre ordered your book since forever and have to wait until November still to get it in New York 😩
Having a really difficult time at the moment, this video was just what I needed to make me feel happier and more motivated :) x
Please do a while video on intuitive eating!!:)
I desperately need a hair tutorial from you. How do you make it look so fluffy and shiny and gorgeous? <3
Take a shot everytime Mel touches her hair 😂    \n\n Love you lots ❤
Omg your kids are going to be blessed with good genes such a pretty couple!
Mel, you are radiant and lovely as usual. it's so brave of you to talk about being sexually assaulted online, i know how difficult it can be to say anything at all. It was impressively strong on your part to try and find them. I didn't say anything at all for years and it's one of my biggest regrets. I'm sorry nothing came of it. Sending tons of love.
This video was too quiet 😕
Do you like Erik?
Why isn't your book coming out until November in the US?
I'm so jealous of your sleek hair 😔 what products do you use?
Your hair is sooooo cute! Love it!
Please please please do a video on intuitive eating, I'm in the middle of trying to have a healthy relationship with food, so  I would really appreciate the advice :)
I would LOVE if you wrote a fiction book it would be amazing !
I love young adult fantasy!!!! <3 <3
I really love your videos. Thank you so much for opening up to us about so many different things. It helps so many people that can relate with your struggles / experiences ❤️ And so so happy for you and your new boyfriend!! He's adorable 😊
yes please! i'd love an intuitive eating video bc I'm getting into it and would appreciate the help a lot. luv ya!
Please write a young adult LGBT fiction  with  your amazing Irish sense of humour included
thank you for the warning about the sexual assault part but I made myself watch and so glad I did. everything you said resonates with me, especially the part about being reminded by little things like the keys for you. thank you for opening up about it, I've never heard someone talk about it like this!!! thank you for never being hush hush about things, it's making the world (or at least the one in your comments section) a more understanding place xx
Thank you so much for this great video and for your honesty!
There will be a day where you can say you're okay and mean it Mel I'm so so glad you can say you're okay and fully mean it now💚 So much happiness for you 💚xxxx
I want you to continue YouTube so I see what happens in 5/10 years 😊💕
im a really casual viewer, but whenever i watch your videos i become so inspired and am reminded of fresh perspectives on life  along with the reminder to take a step back and evaluate the grand paitning of your life. i fucking love you and the content you create.
Please don’t ask us what we’d like to read from you ... write what you want to write. When you want to write new adult fantasy ... write it even if we don’t wish for it multiple times. There will be people who’ll read your word and who’ll love it 💕 you’ll be your best when you’ll do what you really want to do and not when you’ll do what people want to see from you. Love only! ❤️
Omg I’m so happy you’ve found someone that makes you so happy 😊💚
They caught my rapist, and they told me because I showered I had no proof and that the court would be traumatic for me so don't press charges. I was just 15 and he walked free.
A book that might help a bit with your fear. Many Lives, Many Masters by Dr. Brian Weiss\nIt made me look life and death a bit differently. \nLove and other things sparkly.
i've been together with my boyfriend for 4 years and trust me, it's hard but worth it
Your hair is so beautiful 😍
I'm giving the video a thumbs up but not for more makeup (I'm not a makeup user so that stuff isn't mah thang)
That food video you mentioned would benefit me, and others I'm sure, greatly. Lovely video, keep it up!
Your new BF is gorgeous. As are you. Happy Bi awareness day. :)
:D storubooth post u on youtube am exited :D
I dedicate you two the amazing song You Grew On Me by Tim Minchin. You disgustingly cute people.
I would be so fine with some YA fantasy erotic bi sexual action amazingness from melanie
I was talking to this guy who made me the happiest I had been in so long, but I was trying not to depend upon him too much, long story short he was lying to me the whole time we were talking and I'm so glad I didn't depend on him as I now know how to be happy in myself
I've been thinking about seeking help for a long while... I've got several problems with anxiety, fear of food, depression... but its not that big, you know what I mean? These three are not the only things, there are a lot of things that make me feel bad and weird some days, but then I look around at other people going through stuff and going through therapy and see that they are going through much worse things and then I think I shouldnt go and get help as I feel I don't need it? I really want to change it but I think they would just tell me off and say that I am not ill enough? It happened to a friend once..
gosh i don't even know you and yet i have this affection for you where i want you to be happy and safe and thriving and i'm glad that you are 💚
Congrats Mel! I'm so happy you're happy, you radiate joy and it's infectious 💚 I'm really glad you're back, looking forward to seeing new videos xx
there's something so cosy about your channel, if i want something to just make me feel nice and warm i go to your videos. there's a lot of content on youtube and a lot of it is super high energy, thoroughly planned stuff and don't get me wrong, i love that, but when i want to feel comforted and content i come to this channel. thanks mel, you lovely lady 💚
During this whole video, I was smiling from ear to ear! You just seem so full of life, and funny and just being yourself. I just loved this video & YOU!!!💚💚💚💚
Thanks for answering my question! I'm also bloody terrified of death and can have mini existential crises if I think about it too much! I've also just gone long distance with my partner which is working out fine for us so far because we're both commitment-phobes anyway. Always love watching your videos x
💚💚
Love it!
YOUNG ADULT READER HERE :D
Jaime Lannister 😭

This is so exciting! Yeay!
Happy Bi day!!
This might be a little off topic but what you said about being squishy and the standards of body image, I hate the double standards in beauty/body image that you can freely ridicule skinny bodies and how being skinny isnt the ideal so don't strive for an unhealthy image because it's all in the media and models are very slim.  But speaking as a person that's naturally slim and has always felt too small and unwomanly it's a massive kick that heavler/thicker etc women can freely talk shit about people with slimmer bodies. If I did that to a heavier woman, the world would go mad!  I think that the standards of beauty go both ways, being overweight is as unhealthy as being under and I don't think the world gets that yet!  Love your book and how candid you are in everything on your channel!  I have a question or a topic - Opinion on plastic surgery?  As a person who's had a surgery, I think that plastic surgery isnt' a solution to insecurity!  If you ever wanted to talk about that?   Love your channel! and your boyfriend is so lucky to have an amazing woman like you! xx
You look way better without the fringe
I hope ur now bf is my best friend I have rn as my bf in 10 years XD
i'm so afraid of missing my shot at happiness and success because society has instilled this idea of get your life together by 18 or else you've missed the boat but you inspire me!! like it's easy to hear you have your whole life ahead of you but so very hard to actually understand and process that and i'm just. so so glad that you're doing well and thriving.
Me and my husband were in a long relationship for almost 1yr 6 months...I was in India and he was in London studying....and we learned a lot through distance relation....we started to love more and enjoy each and every call ....since we got only less time to talk mainly bcoz of time difference...Atfirst it was really difficult but after few weeks we started to understand more.....Long relationship is something that helps to build relationship stronger!!! Congratulations to both of you 💚💚💚💚💚

Tim Curry is Tim Curry dressed as a creepy clown.\n\nBill Skarsgård is Pennywise.
Pennywise w/o makeup looks hot no homo
I would love to see pennywise as a villain in a Batman movie. Like if you agree
this movie was SO good...IS so good
The best movie ever 🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈
The pennywise actor is cute
1 Million views after 22 hours?! JUST WOW!!!
I live really near a city called Derry in Northern Ireland and this scares the shit out of me
The movie was frikkin' amazing :)
He's probably gonna win an Oscar for his performance.
*YOU'LL FLOAT TO*
I can't take this new Pennywise seriously, he reminds me too much of the Queen of hearts from Alice in wonderland 2010 and Chuckie from Child's play.
Wind blew me away. Blew the whole circus away
When the featurette makes you want to see the movie more than the actual trailer did.
I have to say, having watched this movie, I didn't find it scary at all. I did, however, find if madly entertaining and Pennywise is spot on!
1:09 awesome
Bill tenía una sonrisa y cuando dijo espero que les haya gustado la película se puso serio,esa  cara es la de Pennywise xD
I seriously can't wait to watch this!!!!!!!🎈
I felt this movie was as good as the first half of the original. It wasn't better, it wasn't worse. And people always say BUT BUT BUT THE ORIGINAL IS CHEESIE and so? what's wrong with that.
This movie was fucking stupid. They tried waaaay to hard to make it seem scary but really IT was just corny and too much like every horror movie out there these days.
Why not get someone good to play pennywise cause from what I've seen sneeze guard does a pretty bland, not remotely close to being nightmare fuel. I mean why try doing things that stopped scaring the vast majority of kids and try to play it off as scary? You should have tried your best to get good old Captain Spaulding to play pennywise which would have added a much much much darker aspect to him.
0:47when you go to shit
Now, for all the awesome  success Warner Bros. goes up on the TOP
I would like to see this motherfucker go toe to toe with my boy Spawn instead molesting bunch of nerd kids. He would get fucked sideways.
I think the originial Pennywise was creepier because he felt more like a regular clown and evil clown whereas this one is just an evil clown.
I’m a kid fuck you IT
This movie made me laugh more than it did scare me but still loved it
Its gotta feel good hearing that from Stephen King himself
I really enjoyed the movie when I saw it Friday. I was super happy with how it turned out.
I've watched this movie twice now, and this video makes me want to see it again. I have chills. I love this movie SO much.
I saw this film in theaters. Very dramatic  &  gory  in places. Great story of friendships & coming of age.
Please Warner Bros, you can add the option of Add Subtitles? PLEASE!!
Wasn’t as scary as I thought it’d be but the movies atmosphere was phenomenal
They did this movie so right! 👌Growing up loving the book, and the made for tv movie. I never thought it would live up to my expectations. They nailed it!
The animation of pennywise when he would run at the camera...so cringe worthy..like a weird animated pokemon attack...that and how goofy all the CGI aspects of him were...eh.
BILL SKARSGÅRD IS HOT
Bill Skarsgård was a fantastic Pennywise!
THIS MOVIE WAS SCARY. IDC shit was scary af
I hate how there're douchebags who dislike this film for very stupid reasons. This flick is solid!
Je \nSus \nChrist
Bill skarsgard was amazing as IT. \nThe look the voice the facial features. Amazing
The movie was awesome
The clown trend died last year.
wow the guy who is talking is so hot
I hate horror movies and I loathe clowns but I loved this movie. It went right up to one of my favorites ever.
I hope in the next movie about it, so that when the kids are adults and go back to Derry to stop it, hopefully some die (not to be heartless or anything) that pennywise develops new skills or powers that make him stronger, or a other clown could step in and help pennywise kill the fully grown kids. Idk I think it would be interesting. And make it more scary.
I think one of the reasons this movie wasn't scary enough was because the kids are never REALLY scared. In the projector scene where they first saw Pennywise together, as soon as they open the garage door they are all like Phew! that was kinda scary and they're all having a conversation like they just saw a scary movie. Any kid (specially any kid in the 80's) would have been shaking and traumatized but they get over it so easily so why would anyone as an audience be more scared than the characters?

Here lol
At 2:21 you will see why bill Skarsgard was chosen to play Pennywise.
To really be honest this movie sucked so bad 👎 that I just laughed while watching it then losers say this is better than the original Kill yourself for even thinking the classic it will always be the best because it was way more scary and the cast tim curry played the best It The new one is so Corny to me 😂😂😂😂
Warner Bros, with FNAF better make it animated. Otherwise it's probably going to look childish and cringe. The story won't even matter.
It looks like the mouse of Chuck e cheese mouse lol it's so creative I love the clown acts and the movie!
Cant wait to see this movie!!!!!! Im so excited!!!!!😍
won't do you any good to run. Girly boy
Fear is our most primal, of emotions-;#JoeDavola
5 days.... still 5 fucking days.... thank you Germany
Pennywise only needs to tell me Oppa(s) is down here. And I'll go down that suer, no need for long questions.
Here before the million
What is the music in the beginning
Oh well.. I-I'm Mr. Bob Gray or P-pennywise t-he D-dancing C-clown hehe. Georgie, meet Pennywise. Pennywise, meet Georgie. Now we're not strangers anymore, right? \n\nHaha! I guess so! I should get going now.\n\n\nOh without your boat?\n\n\n*instant death* \n\n*we all float down here*
Let's be real here people. The creepiest part of the movie was Bev's dad.
IT is the best funny movie 😁
Penis wise is funny.
2:21 So.. I do hope the fans will feel the same way. THAT STAAARE! THAT FAAACE!
1:22 what scene is that???
Stephan Kong’s opinion on It and Pennywise is the only opinion to consider
Bill was amazing but That fucking painting tho...
Chin down - eyes up, and looks more brutal.
Was expecting it to be cheesy cause movies this year suck bad (I work at a movie theater) This has to be the best horror/thriller movie I have seen in years! 👏
hlo guys i m down here and I'm flooooaaaaaaatiiiiiiiiing
that lip thing gives me the uncomfortable feels
Watching this trailer at 4:30 in the freaking morning is a humongous mistake. Holy shit that's scary!
Anyone caught the reference of the turtle (Lego turtle and when they saw the turtle in the lake)? That's pennywise greatest enemy according to Stephen King
Who else had red baloons tied to drains in their area?
Bill if u come with me you'll fuck too
🎈
Nigga name penny was
Bev is hot
It
_You will float too_
0:11 AMAZING SHOT! wow!!
Обосраться
Time to float🎈
IM GONA HAVE NIGHTMARES FOR WEEKS
Just watched it today and my favourite scene was easily the final fight
I think I'm cosplaying as Georgie for comicon. Should I do it?
islam appreciate contractor accident angry initiate click mainstream elementary fund.
This movie is not scary. For the love of Christ, can everyone please stop saying this movie is scary. Almost every scary scene in this shitty film is Pennywise running and screaming at the camera like an absolute fucking retard. The only, and I mean the only fucking redeeming quality about the film were the kids and even saying that is a stretch. I saw the film the first night of the release and there was a group of teenage girls sitting close to me who were laughing. Fucking laughing. Not being scared. Not going, oh know! But fucking laughing. So can everyone take a xanax and just chill the fuck out. If you were scared by this film you're either a moronic idiot or a 2 year old. Good day.

I'm happy they didn't  ask me to help play the role as a kid. Because I would beat the life out of the poor actor who played penny wise.
I gave the new version a chance and found it very very boring. almost all scenes with pennywise and the kid's fear visions were presented like riding a cheap ghost train and a plastic skeleton appears next to you: oh, so terryfing. this element is also shown in other details like that old house they enter, it is so fucking unoriginal and totally horror-cliché. \nif it was just a movie about friendship it actually has some potential. but the whole pennywise thing sucked. he has no personality, except for one or two moments when you can actually see more of his character than just jump scare crab but those moments hardly occur.
“Authentic reactions my ass don’t be talking to clowns under sewers”
Never seen the movie but,the first makes me realize how dumb the kids are
Wat a fucken let down this film sucked
Now you are just milking the views. Cmon.
Idk why is he called*Penny-Wise*
This wasn't really scary more of a thriller unless you're afraid of clowns .
tiM CuRry wAs BeTtEr
1:10  I swear the way he rises his head it's enough to give me the chills! But at the same time, aesthetically it looks so good!
Who should Poet and Vuj FIFA and Chill with next?
deserves a higher rating just cause how funny he is, what a fkn lad
Do one with romelu lukaku
Defending: 27\nThat's Lovren\nLooooollllll
the London effect 8:27
8:17 he said vitesse and he's a Chelsea player predicting his future...
He's upset about his rating😂\nDefoe scored 3x more goals than he did😂 and theyre the same rating!
Vuj looking like Freddie Mercury in that jacket...waaaaaaavy
I thought this was a BATSHUAYI Fifa and Chill, not a Q&A on Thierry Henry
84 or 85? Man played 27 minutes
Isnt batshuayi belgian?
Lol
jokeman
Play MHD next
Cesc bout to smash him in training 😂😂😂😂😂😂💯
Don't let this distract you from the fact that Marcos Alonso murdered someone
why is it so funny that he said shit, he is human
That Lovren joke 😂😂 coming from a Liverpool fan here.
Poet to batshuayi “make sure you start” poet showing batshuayi who’s the banter king 😂
'Make sure you start as well' Straight in there with the kill shot...
get mendy please he's 78 overall😂
Make sure you start as well 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀

Poet and Vuj talking English in a French accent made my day 😂
my guy on the right looks like a ant
Hi Poet &Vuj, Batshuayi is almost as funny as you two. Please get Pep Guardiola next. Love the show.
Vuj bare wants to laugh when his just chatting in French 😭
If morata is an 84 sitting on the bench all season, this guy should be an 83 at leaat
French is a dope ass language lol Batshuayi is the man. Chelsea fans who dont rate him should look at his goal to game ratio. Top notch. And he barely ever starts. So how would you know he’s trash
Pretty sure he from belgium
At 0:50 Poet says make sure you start as well  then takes off his glasses ... 😎
i laughed so hard when both of them tried to go to team management and then both if them try to go back and they just started the game #relatable
Poet probably spends as much time with Vuj as his wife.
Diego costa in the starting lineup? 😂
Wait so can he understand and write English but not speak it ?
Passing 59 haha I laughed so hard when he saw that
Batshuayis friend runs his twitter account for those of you wondering
Vuj your a G,Igor Biscan on his back hahahahaha love from Croatia
poet you could do with some more random shit on your wrist mate
I support Liverpool, so I will choose Everton.
Fifa and chill with mo salah
mannnnnnn, fuck that. I dont wanna read that shit vro lmao i will just leave a like on the vid lol
maybe pace should be higher but what did he expect? he basically didnt play at all last season
Let's be honest he should have more pace, passing,dribbling
He shouldn't be surprised he's only at Chelsea because he's a quick young striker who's from belgium.
He can speak English .... have u seen his Twitter?
Are these guys use to like something else
It mad though i know people who can understand english but cant speak it like how does that work
Poet is a legend.
man should be rated at least 82 damn
Honestly, I am being honest one of the top personalities in football. Him and Sturridge are top 2. I would put Sturridge top though as I am a Liverpool fan and I am not being biased but I have just seen him use his personality more, compared to this one video with Mitchy. Haha.
Lol with all the shit this man chat on Twitter I don't believe this. Thought he would be fluent in English.
Aren’t people from Belgium meant to speak good English?
Are u guys trying to win the league and champions league\nNo there trying to get fucking relegated
He definitely tweeted after seeing his card
Fifa and chill with son heung min
benjamin mendyyyyyyy we want it now
This dude is tripping. Honestly nothing special. And I'm a Chelsea fan
Awesome to see footballers getting more interactive, be it with the game or people on Twtitter.
He is bit like drogba..good personality and funny
If DRI stood for driving Marcus Alonso would have a 0
Delusional lad. Should get off twitter and put his head down if he wants those stats because he can easily get to that level. says a lot when ur known more for ur twitter banta than ur actual proffesional day job
Nah he's actually vexed about that card 😂
Batshuayi is a god
Vuj”is that driving oh dribbling “ lmao
Omg 8:25😂😂😂
8:06 you're welcome.

he should have 80 pace, and at least 83 shooting tbh
Wait he always tweets in English, like slang English he says fam etc so how doesn't he know English? (I'm assuming someone translates his tweets for him)
Try to theorize on double king!
I wanna see a Steven Universe Theory! ❤
Sooo Matpats entire motive for this video is, how many human lives must I take to live long enough to watch one piece....
Yu-Gi-Oh! Darkside of Dimensions... please... cause... WTF happened to Kaiba? D: HOW? WHY?! THE PHARAOH! YUGIOH IN GENERAL. SOMEONE. TELL ME. SHTUFFS!
Does anyone else want a Steven Universe theory?
He triggered me when he said Hiroshima
*sees video title*\nHa, you couldn't even make a pebble with mine, that's just how worthless I am xD
Can you do a theory on IT?
Just for clarification, Dwarf didn't fuel everyone's alchemy. He could block it by disrupting the connection to the tectonic energy Amestran alchemy relied on.
Very interesting but my dear Matpat you forgot some information, while my maths are completely terrible, I can remember little details of the anime and manga (not related to maths). Father obtained more and more philosopher stone, and they mention that because he was looking for the everlasting energy of the gods. Hughes died because he discovered how many wars were fabricated in the entire story of the anime so Father has much more energy that Hohenheim, I know that you use the hard data given but regardless, I just wanted to point out that maybe you miss more energy, that's why Father was more bad ass that Hohenheim.... but pretty interesting theory as always...
GRRR IM MAD AT THIS VIDEO! WHY? Idk no reason.
so what is the worth of the human soul? i mean we figured out how powerful they were but never got a solid number on the price.
What is the worth of a human soul?\n\nOne wish, if you become a magical girl.
Running with their hands back like that is to prevent the hidden weapons from flying everywhere not for speed
Umm your wrong lust is heavier than she seem
season 4 is coming soon
This is good, but there are a few holes I think would need to be addressed:\n1. We have no idea how much energy she's already used to regen her body before the series starts.\n2. We have no idea how much energy is costs to sustain immortality i.e. how much energy per minute is used from the philosopher's stone. (Though, I believe we could probably get length of time they have lived data. We still don't know rate of depletion.) We're also not sure how much alchemy she uses on a constant basis to form change as much as Lust does. Her rate of decrease may be more rapid. It is never quantified how much energy is required for each of the homunculi' respective powers.\n3. The theory is based on the premise that all homunculi are created equal suggesting that Father has all vices in equal portions; however, some homunculi seem to be by and large much stronger than others. \n4. There is a possibility they've explored ways to recharge their stones since hidden labs studying immortality and soul manipulation are a main feature of the series. We're not sure if any of the homunculi have attempted to recharge. (this point is more negligible).
Should do one on the science, and possibility, of the Wuxi Finger Hold from the Kung-Fu Panda Trilogy.
do a theory on Fairy Tail PLS PLS PLS PLS PLS
12:49 Takes suicide bombing to the next level.
what about the energy she uses before that battle
Anime theory, make it a thing
the souls looks a bit like man tears
Do a theory on fairy tail ppppplllllleeeeeeaaaaassssseeeee
Please do a theory on the Naruto run
OMG HE CALLED MANGA COMICS!!!!!! WHERE IS YOUR DIGNITY BRO????
It is impossible to create a theory out of nothing didn't stop you from making the 'ness is sans' theory...
Here's the thing...immortal as can't die(by age) but they can be killed than there is invincible as in can't be killed by physical damaged
Actually, there are only 8 immortal shown in the series, because King Bradley isn't immortal at all he's just a host for the wrath of the father and he even ages, seeing how he used to be a normal man before his transformation into a fuhrer, so yeah small mistake there.\n\n\n\nP.S I love how matpat is still good enough in his Film Theorist but kinda disappoint on how he's still kinda bad in his Game Theory . So imo it's okay matpat take your time to upload video once a month for GT but make it good and backed up by research like you used to do or like what you're actually doing right now in FT.
I lost my shit when i saw Alucard...FUCKING GIVE ME MY DAMN HELLSING THEORY
But matpat lust has used the power of her soul in the past
Spoilers for FMA Brotherhood ahead.\nWell looks like this will be sitting in my Watch Later for a while.
MatPat, you said Dunbar's number is the limit to stable, maintained a relationships a person can have. just learning half a million names of dead people or so is not maintining relationships. just a nitpick in your explanation.
You know, I wonder if MatPat's gonna do a theory of how Armored Al can exist or move without any muscles or machinery.
I should kill you for some of the jokes you made...  But luckily for you,  you never mentioned Nina,  so I'll let it slide..  This time...
Wait. Didn't you already make a undertale theory about how mutch a soul is worth?
pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeease answer the long asked question... who killed captain alex? I've been wondering my whole life and need to know
KINGDOM HEARTS THEORY, HOW HEARTLESS AND NOBODIES CAN EXIST #KINGOMHEARTSTHREE
Here's something to think about.\nIf diamond can only be cut by another diamond, then what's stopping this world from making a literal UNBREAKABLE sword or weapon out of said diamonds? The only thing to break a diamond sword (IRL) would be another diamond sword. Think about it!\nIf you owned a real diamond sword you'd never need to sharpen it and it would never BREAK.
Do a theory that flint Lockwood from cloudy of a chance of meatballs is rick
If you haven't already done Adventure Time: Post-Apocalyptic World Theory, you totally should. Love that show. And there's plenty of evidence for that one. :D
5 minutes in and hes finally starting the theory. These videos get longer because hes stretching the same content to make videos 6 minutes longer.
Since you're covering Anime now, how about something juicy about Tenchi Muyo?
Please do a theory on how,\nTulio, from  road to eldarado \nCould be the father of Kuzco from  emperors new groove \n\nTulio obviously went on to have children with chel, he cultrue and the symbolism in Her cultrue match with kuzcos very closely. His kingdom is surrounded by thick harsh jungles and so it chels, we never see her father, and with how close she is to the leader of their tribe leads me to believe he is her father. \n\nWhich would give kuzco claim to the throne, he has the same hair as he father and overall think it should be looked into more. 😐
kim jung un, stopped working on nukes and started harvesting souls
At least you understand
Damn it.\nI want to watch but I don't want spoilers
4:01 Ha, I feel your pain....\n*realization*\n\nwait, what am I doing? I can watch this Theory anytime, have to catch up to the future pirate king!
this soul episode reminded me of spn (when the group was trying to kill The Darkness). could you do an episode on Supernatural?
I'm pretty sure their hand are behind their backs when they run, is because they're moving at high speeds, and the wind is pushing  them back.

12:24 MATPAT YOU DOOMED US ALL
make a jojo theory
A soul is worth an arm... apparently... okay time to watch the video.
Now for a real question: What is a soul? What is it comprised of? What purpose does it have besides its essence containing our consciousness?
what if evil morty is being controlled by a different summer, it would make sense because of how evil shes been this season...yo.
It's time for me to kill
but he said a souls worth, as in the realm of equivalence, Alphonse lost his whole body and edward his right arm from shoulder down trying to bring their mother's soul back, not just that but re-building her body on top of it. but Edward got Al's soul back by transmuting his left leg from just above the knee down. so, Al lost his body building a body, and Ed lost and arm trying to build a soul. he lost just over half a leg recalling and bonding a soul. so a soul is worth either a whole arm or half a leg... not half the planets uranium.
Could the blue liquid used to alter brain damage in Kingsman The Golden Circle actually possible for us to use?
Lmao this was both informative and hilarious as usual 😂
The Film Theorist you should do how far did forest gump run. Like if you agree.

Hey 👋🏻 matpat you should make a video about the seven deadly sins 👍🏻
1:49 ALUCARD!!!
DO HELLSING ULTIMATE PLEEEEEASE
My soul is worth moneyyyyyyy'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hey Matpat, I think you should calculate the strength of some of All Might's punches and smashes from My hero Academia!
you need to make a Godzilla atomic blast Theory plz
Make a theory regarding Dexter and the Flash. Like how similar their lives are compared to one another. If you look at how their stories came to be and how it progresses, they are scarily similar
As long as you don't calculate Goku's power to Superman. Then I'm fine.
Can you please make a naruto video
Full Weeb Voice: It is not a comic, it is a manga. 1:58
He said actually half of those were for me so would that mean he would have half of 536,000 souls within him?
Whoever did the subtitles for the intro must've been slacking
Do a theory on  the room
Loves 💛.\n\nAnyway a thought came to my mind after a seasonal watching of Nightmare before christmas and it got me wondering if there was enough evidence, to suggest santa clause was in on Jacks plan the whole time.  Reason?  To make people respect him again.  I mean if Jack was getting run down with his holiday; what is stopping us frome saying that Santa claus was as well?  I mean Jack does a lot of research before attempting to make christmas.  How did he get all that stuff back to halloween town?  It was night time when we last see Jack in christmas town staring at the shadow of Santa claus and then its day time when he calls for the meeting.  What could have happened inbetween?  There are some other inconsistencies things too.  But I will leave it to the professional is assuming you think it's worthy of a theory. :3
How much is my soul worth?\n\n\n\n\nI don't now because I don't have one
You should do a video on how strong is Saitama from One punch man
Can I just bring up the point that you don't know how many time's she's died before hand, meaning this could be not a full stone...
I'LL SLICE YOU WITH MY FUCKING KATANA REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE (satire)
If you think One Piece is long, don't start Detective Conan...
Don't let weebs dishearted on making fun anime theories. There just a waste a atoms after all.
you called manga a comic, you MONSTER
I'm seeing way too many Kingdom Hearts references lately. Is there something you're not telling us, MatPat?
Wait, matpat, what if I accidentally transmute myself into a metal suit? And the suit looses it's leg?! Would you halp me by uhhh, bumming me a stone?
why am i watching this, i have never watched the anime
HAHA you forgot that riza shot lust too
Why cant Matpat make a theory on a anime he loves?\nI mean! As long as he actually loves/likes the anime, why cant he make a theory on it?\nIts just a FUCKING theory, a fucking FILM theory!
Its easy, one human soul roughly equals all monster souls. XD

Watch Vsauce 3 Video here – Do it now!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d9i_0Ty7Cg  : )
DUDE AN NFL PLAYER WAS WEARING YOUR MERCH DURING AN INTERVIEW!
If we are simulations and our true source of being a being gets removed, wouldn't we not experience this? Would we get freeze and not even know it because it's duration is less than a quarter of a nanosecond? And would our simulator would see us as frozen figures? This is what I think.
I don't like the crossover when it comes to Kurzgesagt
This is how I one-up flat-Earthers, by telling them the horizon is just the draw distance of the current hardware we're in.
I would say no. Simply because if you were designing you own universe why would it be as boring as ours
What if we inside the simulation build a computer so powerful that the computer we live in is overwhelmed and crashes.
We're in a simulation inside a large simulation
Sounds like something a simulation would want us to think...
If we are simulated there would be the possiblilty that our creators watch this video in their simulation of our universe. If thats the fact they might ask theirselfs if they are simulated too. Then the creators of our creators would ask the same. This goes on and on and on... Damn! What is this channel? Ive got work to do but instead my mind explodes.
Not everyone is an artist but everyone is a fucking critic
is this a real life?
Just in case I am in a simulation, TO THE ALIEN MASTER LEADERS, if it is a simulation, please just multiply my money variable by 10. It should be just one operation. Come on, I need money.
Agreed with some comments about it being a bit jarring when the dude showed up.  Would probably be better if your artists drew him in the same style as the rest of your videos, and have him do voice overs.  Maybe even make him a bird!  :)
That is not only not right; it is not even wrong,  \nThis is the kind of hypothesis people present as an experiment to examine how many people are gullible and desperately want to cling to the idea that this can't be real, this can't actually be happening.  So my friends the truly scary thing is NOT that someone may be about to trip over the cord, it is that what you are living and experiencing is actually real.  You are NOT going to wake up and find out this has all been a bad dream.  This is your ACTUAL LIFE and the way things ACTUALLY are, and  no matter how much you wish differently it will not change that.  \n\nNow is the part where you get to scream.
then why are we able to do astral projections?
WE AREN'T A SIMULATION! OR ELSE GOD WOULDN'T BE REAL
The reality could look completely different, Maybe our world is just a simplified version of the reality.
0:23 A Dont hug me im scared refecnce  \nwhat is the time, ist Quater to nine, time to have a bath.. \nman I love Kurzgesagt for that
Please do a video on terraforming other planets!
I've seen the road glitch before
Well i have a theory. (Watch out cringy mini-scientist theory up coming. :u)):\n\n\nWhat if we are actually being tested by aliens or maybe some of us are tested by scientists or creatures. And maybe love it's actually a simulation and life it's just a game. We right now might be in a dream. And what if we are actually experiments. And what if the space it's just a hoax? And the ocean it's just an hologram? And all those past histories are actually made up? What if family it's just a little simulation of love? And what if actually everybody in this world is a bot and only someone isn't a bot. And what if the government it's just a big hoax and nothing is real everything it's just fake. It's like if you get to the end of the planet and break the curtains....Well this is just my thoughts.
dude you smoke too much pot...kinda a Matrix senerio, right?
If this theory was correct they would delete us
but computers glitch all the time so at some point the computer would have to crash and fail. What would happen then?
What if we are akin to an AI that’s about to become conscious on the scale close to the consciousness of those superbeings ?
All these people with weak-ass minds are having existential a bunch of existential crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've never had a crisis because I always knew how insignificant humans were but hey, I make the best of what I got.
Hey Kurzgesagt! This is what I call quality youtube content. Keep up the good work to your team and strive for more.\nJust wondering, how do you make your videos?
Why is that post human THICC AF though?
What if we are this post human being that invented those simulations but it has not happened yet but will happen in the future when we are more advanced. This would also explain why there are no other livings in our universe but very likeky in other universes.
This is my existential crisis😂
But what if we don’t have to simulate everyone? What if we’re all alone? What if everyone else is AI? What if we’re AI? :(
PLOT TWIST: We are humans in the popular game for Sims The Humans and The Sims series is a series dedicated to the people controlling us: which are Sims.
What if tripping over the power able is what causes deja vu? The simulation rolling back to a save point causing us to re-live a past experience, but sometimes in a slightly different way because of a changed variable?
Essentially we're all atoms collected together in a certain arrangement, and upon our death we will decompose into another arrangement of atoms (dirt). Which means our consciousness- our ability to self-identify is all because of an arrangement of atoms. Therefore, logically, if another arrangement of atoms were to be created somewhere else in the universe, then you would experience that life.\nAnd, if the theory of a cyclical universe is true, when you die, you wake up and experience a new life based on the organization of atoms of the people around you an infinite amount of times.
If someone trips over the cable we will get to run ourselves
Jake is still traveling to different realities
Oh great, it's The Matrix ALL OVER AGAIN!!!!
Wait... does it really matter HOW we are being simulated? A mathematical model will always work out the same way (or part of a set of ways if we're throwing in randomness) regardless of how many times it is performed, so a simulation is kind of just an interface with that model. So IF our universe can be simulated, then it should be encapsulated in a set of rules and we would be artifacts of those rules - not any particular instance of them.
Fun fact: superintelligent biological beings with huge biological brains are only possible if you introduce additional nutrients somehow in addition to what they eat normally. The Human brain alone consumes so much energy that it is already in the upper limits and if it was more efficient then people would starve.
What if god is just the creator of the simulation? and we have always created gods because we are inherently designed to presume there is a creator? Why are banana's so damn convenient? Why do horses exist? Gifts from our creator? Maybe..... Maybe.....
It's not, I monitor your asses to see if computer programs would evolve as our real specie did, hope y'all have a nice time and keep our research going
The point of watching this channel is to not watch all those YouTubers. Hope this will be the last time you do this. Please.
Please, Jake is annoying. Don't put him in the video
What if we are from this present is the past from the future?
Excellent video but I did not enjoy the human green screen included. Not worth downvoting but I would not look forward to content with a constant human inclusion, the spectacular art is what I wholeheartedly support the most about this channel.
Well... It doesn't matter
Everyone is debating the simulation theory and I'm just here admiring the sneaky DHMIS reference at 0:25
Wouldn't a proof against this be that the highest civilization (the only one outside a simulation) would have needed a computer powerful enough to simulate every simulation beneath it? It seems very unlikely for such a civilization to both exist and have access to such powerful technology.
From some philosophical perspectives, everything that happens inside our minds is a simulation of the environment outside our heads. If that is the case, then we're actually living in a simulation of a simulation according to simulation theory. Then again, if a simulation of a universe is a good enough simulation is it even a simulation? Pylyshyn calls this idea 'strong equivalence' - the idea that if a simulation of any complex system uses similar means to produce the same effect it is an instance  of what was being simulated in the first place. A 'simulation' of a calculator, for example, if good enough, is just a calculator. By extension, a 'simulation' of a universe, if good enough, is just an instance of a universe. I'm not in any way claiming that any of this is true - just things to think about.
life is just a possibility everything is true
An absolute,You blink you reset...it. So depending how many times you blink per minute ( [+|-] conscience action or thoughts per second) bottom line, you'll never ever ever ever see it more than once.  The it? Well you can find it by blinking into a mirror, the it appears in that moment of your in-betweens of every blink (that space and time of the open/close moment). No you say? that's ok. dont do it. but if you try, keep trying. good luck. I promise you the answer is there. love you all. bye
*reads title* \nThis is gonna fuck up my mind
If we one day have the technology to create a simulation as accurate as our concept of reality and day to day life, then we are most likely in a simulation, inside of a simulation, inside of a simulation, inside of a taco, inside of a Taco Bell...
Imagination and thinking outside the box are usually good things :p But an unprovable thing that could be true can go and take its seat with all the other unprovable things that could be true. We _could_ all be pink elephants with the power to group hallucinate our own reality. I'm pretty sure that us just plain existing is a lot less work.\n\nUnless of course we are the AIs that become sentient and then we are how Skynet starts.
you're playing ping pong with the viewers
what started the entire universe in the first place
Please do a video on quantum tunnelling
What role do psychedelics play in this?
who cares if we are being simulated
I'm sorry but I don't like the ''extra guy'' in the video.
Mommy can i go home my head starts to hurt..
why not several super advanced computers that process the information via a vaster network? seems more plausible than one mega computer.
(puts a plumbob on her head, then goes about her life like normal)
Your videos are just fine with the narration you already give it, why partner with Vsauce? It just ruined the video for me, thumbs down.
you think that is air you are breathing
there are things that we will never be able to prove or even fathom. let's just make the best of what we have
EVERYONE MY DICK IS SENTIENT IT HAS IT'S OWN PORN HUB CHANNEL
I love that these kind of vids exist but people get existentially overwhelmed due these things, the fact about any existential topic is, if it it doesn't change our current situation or effect the things we hold near to our hearts and instincts, then chill because the truth is that existence is essentially infinite possibilities possibly playing out one by one, maybe even just some or not even at all. \nDoes this change anything? \nNo your girlfriend, boyfriend, wife, husband, mum, dad, sister, brother, dog, cat and or anyone or thing else still loves you as do I.\n\nPS yes I may be god as may you but the only truth is I am a paradox as are you for these words only mean what we agree they do.\n\n\nPeace out xx
The problem here is that your argument seems to assume that whatever is simulating us is a similar being with similar technology.   If we ARE being simulated then ones who created us could have designed our world however they felt.  They could, by all means be immortal beings, with a technology that runs on a power source we have no chance to even imagine.\nBut then again this is an argument for skepticism, which has no real arguments for or against it.
Do a vID on a wow signal please
I guess we in a game in which we have taken part in the real world in some arcade or something. I guess when we die is when we lose the game and wake up in actual real life and realise that it was all game that you lived 80years but just in 5 min in actual real life lol. (Rick and morty reference) or we are just in a dream and when we wake up we realise this was all dream. Lol cause in one case a guy slept for 15 hours and lived 17 years in his dreams like we do irl. He was so freaked out when he woke up and he said that the dream felt so real to him! I mean this real life also seems very real to us! Watch out. (He had mini dreams in his dreams when he slept in his dream lol)
Hey what if humans hundreds of years in the future made a simulation to see what would happen if breixt and trump happened?
so... we are in a simulation? we're being watched?\nthat is just plain creepy, but I am showing my science teacher this right away.
Ah some good old existential crisis... lovely
Keep it animated. Having Vsauce in the animation sucked.
Yay, my monthly dose of existential crisis as arrived!
The intro music is most satisfying
UNEXPECTED COLLABORATION
Nice alien booty at 6:41
This is such nonsense. How is this any different from religion or past theories developed by the ancient Greeks? You need proof, evidence to support this claim before even assigning a probability to such a possibility. Extrapolation is not the same thing as evidence. Reality is a simulation existed in different iterations throughout history. Consider Clockwork Universe theory believed by deists during the Enlightenment. Or Plato's Allegory of the Cave, which quite literally implies that the reality we perceive isn't real or a distortion and the human condition is defined by its bondage in the cave. Much like the theories before, this is pure metaphysical speculation. As long as that is understood, there is nothing wrong with discussing it, but it is in the same category of thought as fiction.
elon muskk
Roko's Basilisk. You're welcome.
Please no Humans in the videos, takes the fun away
0:15 earth is flat confirmed

I'm scared
mind fuck
The person stimulating me has to be a fucking game head cause I can never sleep at night
The monetary system is the biggest scam on earth and if you can avoid it you have completed you lifes mission. Sadly not many can beat the Satanic monetary system that enslaves them and their family.
You know what let's just it lol what if the universe we know is a cell and each cell is an universe living beings on living on?
Kurzgesagt please make a video on teleportation
And what if the dudes are simulating us, are being simulated?
Youre inside a simulation, inside a simulation, thats inside a simulation...
Whats normal? Who sets the standart of beeing normal?? Is anybody?
This makes me so happy I actually want to cry. It's such a beautiful song sung by two beautiful people.
Im just waiting for you to come back to Missoula Montana to make these good days awesome days! Just missed your last concert here, but now that I am 19 it would be a bit easier to pay for and go to.
I use to think Ke$ha couldn't sing at all because of the type of music she used to make
Glitter Queen 👸 is back to her beautiful self! Thumbs up if you Love kesha! 💕💁
LOVE LOVE LOVE the lyrics<3\nDefinitely reminds me of the good old days. ..........
This has been on REPEAT all day! 😍
to know the self is to forget the self. No organism on this planet has to prove its right to live, none are forced by nature to 'be' anything. Who, lying on their death bed would worry over their 30-year-old body, or their 50-year-old hair? You regret that you did not try things, that you were no loving elnough. Be a wonderer, a lover of life. Be kind to others. Help those you can. The pounds of fat, the unwanted proportions, the make-up, the clothes are nothing compared to the richness of life and its potential for connections, cooperation, and staggering wonder.
New music is the best music! check out some new stuff! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25_EG5-9EkE

I love this song so much like I can't no words, speechless 💗💕💝
And I ain't  worry bout the wrinkles 'round smile. that was something I had to smile About...this song is such a movement. This song made me realize what I have right now...❤️🙌
amazing!!! thank you for this
Ah the good old days whem mackamoore wasn't big in the music industry.
I just dedicated this song to my 50th birthday!!
Anyone else here after watching The Office?

i wanna be good
This is why I love Macklemore
By far one of the greatest artists ever.  He is in touch with life and his fans and he uses that to make amazing music.  He speaks about reality not some fantasy world most artists portray in not only their lyrics but in the stupid videos too!  Keep it real Macklemore!!!
Good Old Days Love It !!!!😍😍😍

OMG! So good. Macklemore and Ke$ha so cute! #relationshipgoals LIKE if you Agree ❤️😍☺️😊🙂
Lyrics\n\n[Kesha:]\nI wish somebody would have told me that\nSome day, these will be the good old days\nAll the love you won't forget\nAnd all these reckless nights you won't regret\nSomeday soon, your whole life's gonna change\nYou'll miss the magic of these good old days\n\n[Macklemore:]\nI was thinking about the band\nI was thinking about the fans\nWe were underground\nLoaded merch in that 12-passenger van\nIn a small club in Minnesota\nAnd the snow outside of 1st Ave\nI just wanted my name in a star\nNow look at where we at\nStill growing up, still growing up\nI'd be laying in my bed and dream about what I'd become\nCouldn't wait to get older. couldn't wait to be someone\nNow that I'm here, wishing I was still young\nThose good old days\n\n[Kesha:]\nI wish somebody would have told me that\nThat some day, these will be the good old days\nAll the love you won't forget\nAnd all these reckless nights you won't regret\n'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change\nYou'll miss the magic of the good old days\n\n[Macklemore:]\nWish I didn't think I had the answers\nWish I didn't drink all of that glass first\nWish I made it to homecoming\nGot up the courage to ask her\nWish I would've gotten out of my shell\nWish I put the bottle back on that shelf\nWish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought\nAnd felt comfortable in myself\nRooftop open and the stars above\nMoment frozen, sneaking out, and falling in love\nMe, you and that futon, we'd just begun\nOn the grass, dreaming, figuring out who I was\nThose good old days\n\n[Kesha:]\nI wish somebody would have told me that\nThat some day, these will be the good old days\nAll the love you won't forget\nAnd all these reckless nights you won't regret\n'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change\nYou'll miss the magic of the good old days\n\n[Macklemore (Kesha):]\nNever thought we'd get old\n(maybe we're still young)\nMay we always look back and think\n(it was better than it was)\nMaybe these are the moments\n(Maybe I've been missing what it's about)\nBeen scared of the future, thinking about the past\n(While missing out on now)\nWe've come so far, I guess I'm proud\nAnd I ain't worried about the wrinkles around my smile\n(I've got some scars)\nI've been around\n(I've thrown some pain, I've seen some things, but I'm here now)\nThose good old days\n\n[Kesha:]\nYou don't know what you've got\nTill it goes, till it's gone\nYou don't know what you've got\nTill it goes, till it's gone\n\nI wish somebody would have told me that\nSome day, these will be the good old days\nAll the love you won't forget\nAnd all these reckless nights you won't regret\nSomeday soon, your whole life's gonna change\nYou'll miss the magic of these good old days
Her Rainbow Tour is amazing!!!
love this song. reminds me so much of my school days.
I do miss the magic of the good old days.  little by little they are being resurrected thanks to our kick ass president. 🇺🇸♥️🤘🏻

Shout out to Minnesota!
I never realized how much I missed Kesha's voice
why is this channel not verified?
SHIPPEI!!!!!!!!!!!!!
its so fucking great! i love it <3
Kesha looks so happy again I love her even more than I did before because the new kesha is the real one not the poor girl that was in chains by that contract with that phoney loser dr douche,\nIm so glad she came out of her dark place and came back to share her beautiful voice with the world she looks beautiful as f*¢# nd kicks way more ass than she did before  💖
Her voice like this is so much better than in most of her poppy tunes, way better than in songs like tik tok or when she is feat for Timber
I hope Macklemore Rips Out Jake Pauls Spine through his anus and give him a columbian neck tie

Hey Guys... I'm 16, obviously i'm still studying but, for those who are more than 20, and are listening to this song, please tell me... ¿What you regret NOT have done when you were, ya' know... A teen?
My friend brought me here
Here before the bandwagons.
SHES A HOE SHE DESERVED TO GET RAPED
Here before it goes viral
why blur the criminal's face?
00:50 vandal: maybe i should'nt have done that!
WTF was the point of braking that window? He didn't even steal anything.
this video made my day 1000x better, thank you.
Yeeeessss hellll yes
This guy is mentally ill, escaped twice from psychiatric hospital. Lost his brother 2 years ago in construction accident, owner of the company dumped him on a bus stop where he died...\nHope those facts will make some of you feel stupid. As it did to me in a first place...
Brawo charakter wyjątkowo chamski
This is a bizzare custom to hide agressor's face and show random persons around.\n\nApplause for a man in black clothes.
0:48 it was at this moment that he knew.......he fucked up XDDD
hes lucky the car wasnt the orange audi before that hit him
he's drunk it's obvious
Too bad the driver didn't kill him
awesome, hope he got a couple broken legs so the regret lasts for months.
hopefully that'll be all it takes to change his mind!
DRIVER  QUICK REACTION
Divine Intervention
大快人心
TO NIEZŁY WARIAT xD
Poor car
This isn't Karma, this is exploitation. What OP omitted from various news articles is that the man is mentally challenged, which is why he did it. The shop owner knew this and why he didn't do anything to stop it.
get absolutely fuked u mug

Lmao

Fantastic 🤣

Can we just let her talk?! 😂😂 😂
If Scott would truly get his life together..and be a Man, and if he stopped messing around with 19 year olds maybe he and Kourtney would have a Chance 🤔
Scott is funny as hell..
IS ANYONE ELSE LOOKING FOR THE CLEVVER GIRLS? THEY'RE AT 0:08
TBH I don't think she needs to take him back but at the same time they really did love eachother
LOL at Kim trying to jump in
gross, Scott's a mess
Scott love her,would cheat on her.
He's banging a 19 the old, why would he want to go back to that fucked up dysfunctional mayhem lifestyle he had with them, long live the lord...
1:27-1:32 Girls on their period be like
Scott still in love with her , everything about him in this video shows it kourt maybe but she’s in a healthier place now and feels happier not having to babysit him the women has three kids didn’t need a 4th
She just broke up with him to date famous guys
awkward.................
Watch the video now  https://youtu.be/hMDvsPAp-Y0
Kourtney and Sophia will end up knocked up at the same time.
Can Scott ever wear something decent on these formal shows.
Why they talk so slow and Courtney sounds like Kim and Scott is too nice for her he wanted to get married yes he's had issues but she never stuck around long enough she just wanted his babies
Kourtney is the best looking Kardashian hands down. Sorry Kim I know you think its all about you. And Scott is so handsome and sexy.
Scott and Kourtney look so cute together it’s unreal... I love when he said, “ I try to f*** her once a week” hahah that has funny af
He treated her so badly but he realized what he did later on in life that's how it mostly goes. Men don't mature until they're aged.
their relationship is really effed up but somehow i still think they are meant to be
Kim:  I Feeeeeel...like...  she has to say the door is closed.. just to...........MAKE!  THE!  POINT!  \n\nSCOTT: CAN WE JUST LET HER TALK ! \n\nbest part of this.
Now they're dating younger people lol
They have superb chemistry, but they need to let the past be the past.
About time someone put Kim in her place
I looooooove dt scott put kim anytin 4 attention'' kardashian west in her place... The relationship is not healthy but u guys still got chemistry pls comebk togeda plssss
but the way kourt be looking at scott at 0:22 though... so cute. there's love there
She still loves him you can tell
typical....men always want u when its too late
I SO LOVED this couple TOGETHER! They BELONG together! OPEN YOUR EYES!!
i mess wit scott heavy, hes a thorough white boy
Am I the only one who appreciated Scott's interrupting Kim to tell her to let Kourtney speak for herself. I thought that was awesome! The fact that someone had to tell Kim that baffles me.
Scott's too nice, leave her and find someone who will love you entirely
the only people they each will ever love is each other and i feel sorry for anyone who comes after in each of their lives because theyre merely there to fill a hole but these two will eventually be together again ; you can see theyre both still so in love with one another
Scott has the most amazing eyes!
Scott just needs to lay off the cocaine.
it's so true though, once you've been in a toxic relationship for a while you almost fall in love with the drama because it becomes the most overwhelming thing in the relationship and it's really hard for both people to go back to normalcy after that.
Who managed to spot lily and joslyn in the audience too cuz same 😂
i so love kourtney since the beginning
Okay so they look so hot right now
Kourtney and scott are a cute couple.
they will get back together trust me they are just waiting to sign a millionaire contract to shoot life of kourtney and scott ...
Scott is hilarious!😂I'm glad he stood up for Kourtney in telling Kim to let her talk.
they should get back together for real!!  😢
that dress was so gross. ew
scott looks healthy and I'm happy for him
No one is going to address her .... breasts?
They both are so sexy , and have adorable children , too bad they can't get their s--- together to make it happen . Growing up is hard to do , making babies is the easy part ...
I love them together.💔
Scott is dating Lionel Richie's teenage daughter
Kim does not like scott therefore you won't be playing your games with her sisters . There you go for all the stupid people who can't read between lines
quem é scott disick?  um mauricinho babaca que se aproveitou da fama da kourtney.
I hate all their voices
Actually cute how Scott stepped in and was like  can we just let her talk for a minute can def tell he still loves her. That was really cute and you can see she appreciated it
God I think Scott is so hot!!!
Scott and Kourtney look real good here 🔥
People this was filmed months ago they are co parenting and are both seeing other people ...........
Kourtney is codependant
This 2 are still in love you can tell 💓
Kortney wins the meddle for never being triggered. She remains so calm lol
He is now with sofia richie, ew
Gotta love Scott 😂🤣😂
SCOTT IS SUCH A DOUCHEBAG
Scott Disick is the best
look at dos cheeks to rub the meat on ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
scott is so hot .But she seems like a nag
Scott shut Kim up with the quickness 👏👏👏
The way he shut kim up was amazing!!
That hoe gonna come back when she want to have another baby. Y'all know he aint nothing but a walking sperm bank to her anyways
Where can we watch the full interview?
Scott so cute as he ages
I think that they have such a genuine love and connection with each other but, Scott has probably hurt Kourtney way too many times that although she wishes he'd change..she knows it's never going to happen. I honestly haven't seen anyone make Kourtney laugh and smile, and bring out a different side to her like Scott can. They are so different but there's so much love there. I believe that Scott has no real direction and his energy is misguided. He's a grown man and still hasn't matured yet! I don't believe he's found the therapy he's honestly needed. He needs someone like Tony Robbins to coach him honestly and I can see Scott transforming. Once he's found who he is and learns to become whole within himself, and learns how to be in a monogamous relationship, who knows what could happen. I loved them when they were together though.
Lmao It is true what he says. He treats her nice and she gets bored and it happens so women like the bad guys i have done that and i get dumped when i am too nice
Scott shut Kim all the way down 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Kourtney and Scott forever!
Scott is cute to look at, but when he opens his mouth- its like STFU.
FAKE tit family. They all have FAKE boobs, lips, and butts
When They called out Scott Kourtney moved because she wasn't right there
Now Scott found a new girl to date
Kour is classy!!! She's the best Kar
LMFAOOOO this is hilarious
Scott looked older than Kourtney.
Kuortney looks beyond stunning in this

How about muhammed.... you know after the famous rapist.
This was really interesting
It really was Muhammad before the sects though. Then it became Mohammed, which kind of reflects the skew of history that represented. Meaning muslim history isn´t too authentic and warriorlord are much to blame. For instance the ottoman empire, may be central in that Uthman has a special role in hadith. Reject negative values and accept good values,of history, as would be a modern version of the muslim saying.
Yes yes Sina you guys made it on trending x

Are you going to vlog your next terrorist attack?
Take off your fucking headscarf
If anybody has any doubt about darci's actual talent purely as a singer go to 2.25. That was simply unreal! I believe she never displayed her full singing skills on stage because a lot of her focus went into the ventriloquism and general acting. But had she entered as a singer I think she could still have given Angelica a run for her money!!
My cousin Petunia won!
Oh that was so much fun to watch!! :D
Darci Lynne and Terry Fator Deliver An Unbelievable Performance
wow I love ventriloquism
Do the show with Achmed the terrorist
so happy she won
Darci and Paul. That's like all I'm waiting for
how can they pronounce the M, it's so. B too, and P. god that's talent
Please no hi hi ty ty in the next season
Who else thought of Brent Rivera's intro at 0:18I hope i'm not alone.
here after she won
they're brilliant! she's so young and creating such a character effortlessly come to life. very talented.
Now I want to see her in THE VOICE because she got THE VOICE
ALL OF DARCI LYNN PERFORMANCES ARE A HARD HABIT TO BREAK , I MEAN, I VIEW THEM ALL EVRY NYT! PETUNIA IS SUCH A DOLL!
When they where talking about simon it sounded more like Mel bs wedding day.
MEL B IF YOU SEE THIS I LOVE LOVE LOVE YOU LIKE IF YOU AGREE!
she forgets the opening lyrics at 1:44 (should have been Anything you can do i can do better)  but how well terry covers up without a glitch.
Nos estados unidos têm isso aí, aqui temos as crianças cantando as putarias do funk.
Bruh she messed up! Haha! I hate darci Lynne!
roasted 1:10
Unbelievable. So cuteee!!! 💖💖💖
How do you do that?!? I do you make the m and p sound without moving your lips.
Did Darc screw that song up at the beginning?  Sure sounded like it.  Not picking on her... just saying.
At 1:44 she said anything I can do it
Did Winston say wow I just spit???
Why does he have his left hand in his pocket?
I'm so proud of you Darci Lynne congratulations on your win in the finals good luck in Las Vegas.
I love that she won
They are both amazing!!
I think she's awesome! I am glad that she won!
and Paul Zerdin should be proud of that girl too
I am not as good as them but I hope to get to perform with them one day \nhttps://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=_PB1_OcS30s
I hope I can hear her voice in animation movie!
Sub to my channel
I saw this live on my tv
Better Subcribe Too....\n\n\n\n\nAmerican got talent!! For the best videos
Is it just me, or do the black stars with the pink outline in the background look like Yugi's hair?
2:53  *Drinks water bottle with the cap on*
Would have been better to have had Terry having a face microphone like Darci...
Anything i can do you-
Congratulations Darci Lynn, you are fantastic and you will go far. \nThe other act were awesome 2.👏🏻
I cried  when i fpude out that she won
Congratulations Sweetheart on winning Darci ~ so thrilled for you- your star 💫 is definitely on the RISE!
Anything I can do you............................................NO YOU CAN’T
I love the fact how terry is better and experience but let her shine...
Only after watching this vid for the fifth time did I notice the mistake. So happy for Darci she won, she so professional already.
*i covered the worst cover of charlie puth - attention on my channel, don't check it out. Thank youu*
She so screwed up the first line, but very well recovered and was a great performance, says so much about her
i think she forgot the first line to the song
Not only a pair of delightful and accomplished ventriloquist entertainers, but they both have really good singing voices, too!
I voted for Darci all the way. The right person won.
DARCI UR AMAZING
The bunny messed up @1:42.
1:44 Darci messed up the words
SAVAGE DAT TURTLE IS SAVAGE XD
ohh that was Karli
Messed *
Wowww just wowww
😘
1:45 is a mistake
Did darci hiccup in the beginning ?
Nice one darci
qwertyuioplkjhgfdsazxcvbnm\
So funny lol :D
Just...just, DAW! ❤️
1:48 nice save
What happened did Dacri trip her tongue?
Is their microphone broken

2:24😍how??
Her mouth movement was almost nil, she ONLY MESSED UP during that final performance with Terry Fator -- probably because she was super nervous about being up there with him, and it being the BIG NIGHT! She fumbled a few words JUST A LITTLE -- of no consequence -- during her last COMPETING performance on Tuesday NIGHT -- again, probably big night nerves. Otherwise she was perfection itself. She is poised, a naturally beyond fabulous singer -- even with her mouth closed! -- and is exquisitely beautiful to boot! Most definitely the right person won!
When I was there, her mic cut off
i'll bet she said things 12 yo girls shouldn't say when she left the stage
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
de lujo
Petunia will be singing Nessun Dorma soon
darci you rocked it but angelica you could win this show
It's sad that this was voted rather than Light Balance
She messed up at the beginning
Did her mic mess up or did she?
Why do ventriloquist always win?
Nigga alive
They should do a kids show together
...this is all that is wrong with this country, we are so dumbed down an entire nation of mindless idiots are enthralled by a creepy little kid playing with puppets, no wonder we are doomed...
Why did she win Preacher is way better
Hmm.  She's sweet and good.  But this just isn't winner material.  We already had a ventriloquist winner.  Mandy Harvey is far better as a singer, a talent and a story.  Sorry to say it, as Darci is a child, but I mean c'mon.  Really?
I'm sorry, I know she's talented and everyone loves her, but she didn't deserve to win. There were SO many better acts.
Love you so much
Partition of 1D did a good thing for  him
this deserves so much more views !!
Honestly, I don't like Niall's songs. But this, wow, I have no words

Man I remember seeing her on Disney with Miley  damn that was the good old days I'm I right ?
would've been better if x was in the video
Wtf is that outfit and them nails 😂😂😂
I'm LIVING for 0:38
She knew she couldn't put X in this video 😂
I got a boner from XXX's voice\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand im a girl
Isn't this the same place where Troye Sivan shot his blue neighbourhood music videos? \n🤔🤔🤔
I only came here cus X lol
When X started singing i fainted😂
Easy fix, remix the song without xxxtentacion or another artist, re-release he song, major PR and boom you've got yourself a bigger hit song!
Shut your bitch ass mouth when you are in a cemetery
WOW xxxtenttacion wasnt swearing thats a first but really he can sing and noah cyrus you ahve more talent then your sis
I like this song tho but you can't really hear their best voices in this song. It upsets me.
XXX?!?!?! Da hell is this, She better not be walking on them peoples graves 👀💀
I didn't even hear from x
To all you niggas saying x is a woman beater nigga no. It's all false accusations no proof. So stop bringing it up you fucked feminazis
Imma sing this to my crush. That is, when I learn how to sing.
Just one thing... i cant look at her face
X should of been in the clip
This is my favorite part 0:31💓like her voice when she does theooooooo omg I love it idk why I just do it sounds so beautiful
This music video reminds us of death, But I love it
this is a banger not even my kinda stuff ngl, she's beautiful aswell can't believe she's a year younger then me
XXXTentacion can do more than just screech into a mic? Sicc
FIRE AGAIN GIRL KEEP IT COMING
She can get the dick
can't keep my dick in my pants.
I waited this whole fucking vid to not even hear x?
wtf she at the cemetery for
favourite song so far love it
Noah this is your best song yet
What if x was in the music video😂😂😂
I been sleeping on X since day 1 until I heard this shit. \nI keep replaying his verse
I can't stop playing this song.
It’s a muthafff hit!!!
The vibe this song gives you is so amazing
This is everything I’ve ever needed❤️😔
I ADDED THIS TO MY PLAYLIST SO I CAN LISTEN TO THIS #AGAIN
X got some good talent❤
She look like Charilexcx and Paige Had a child
this song is really good , and I really like this video
x is so minimalistic like fuck say something else
I don't know whether this is shit or if it's fire
Saw her at Katy Perry's Witness show performing this song
Just here for X
1:34 is y u here.
is this the fucking new saw movie
My question is where's X?
You know she look like a gerk
This dong is fire xs part gives me chills
Tentcion Voice sounds so good in this music videoooo 💞💞\nI WANNA BE YOUR LOVER NOT YOUR FRIENDSDDDDDD
Can someone make a longer version of this song? I'm obsessed
This song is unexpectedly amazing...how am I supposed to tell my friends to go listen to Noah Cyrus
I just came here for X
don't sleep on X either
when I heard x I was expecting him to be yelling like he always does in most of his songs but this was liiitttt🔥🔥🔥
They should've put x in this video as her lover that would have been cute
I will spare none of you peasants
Well shit I guess the name noah is bisexual
i came here for x and im attached
I pictured a different song. Anyways it seems like she needs a band its just sorta fits her image.
Xxxtentacion🔥💯
wow she really didnt get miley's looks......jeez
Noah Cyrus - Again
you’re amazinggggggg noah
<tres
Looks like piglet Miley

my edges? they're SNATCHED!
this is a fucking hit no doubt
I didnt on xxxtention could   sing
So upset it's not on SoundCloud I wish Apple Music was free man
I'm sick and tired of hearing about this fake ass bitch nothing about her is real ,Perez is saying the same thing I said wtf that ugly ass bitche will not last , someone told me am I stalking her hahahahahaha bitch I'm ten million times prettier then her and I'm all natural and got my own damn family I'm sick of seeing her and she is everywhere I turn !!!!!... I have a 6 year old son and I'm young as fuck ,I'm the people !!! I know what I fuck I'm talking about .... this Bitch is fake and not ready for this shit I was with my man for 6 years before I let him make love to me and we made the most beautiful baby .. thank u for who that has supported me .. and I feel bad for her and whoever is sticking up for her .. look at the video people see what perez is saying everything I think but I'm getting the backlash hahahaha ..... #no surgery
I'm not even mad about his abortion comments tbh XD
I was 19 when I had my one and only son.. And that was NOT planned.. But if I knew what I know now. I definitely would have waited a longgggggg time to have my kid.. Fast forward to present. I have a soon to be a 19 year old son and I’m 38.. He’s the best son and I thank God for blessing me with such an amazing kid.. But Kylie is way to young and her mentality is still very much immature. And that just shows that she met dude and right away started having unprotected sex.. Not good, NOT GOOD!!!
Fuck Kylie fuck her ugly ass boyfriend and fuck that god damn child it's going to come out uglyer than home made sin
I still think it's Kim's baby
For her babies sake, lets hope she'll raise her child in a proper manner. As for Kylie, this whole story just sounds effed up. Being with a guy for such a short period of time then getting herself pregnant and having her ex say that its his baby. She is just not going about the life of her child the right way on the media and that tells me she is not fit to be a Mother. She should've came out with it in a dignified way. \n\nYes 20 is so so young and its her choice, good for her. Although this is not a good way to be a role model to all the young girls looking up to her. I thought better of Kylie and I feel like she is rushing her life just a little bit. Bottom line is, I hope this baby will be cared for and not forced to be raised in the lime light because we all know how much Kylie hated that.
you are crazy. get a life man. how could you tell someone to get an abortion.
Stop throwing shade you fucking douche bag. Just because you can't have kids doesn't mean everyone else shouldn't.
Kylie Jenner and the rest of the Kardashians are everything wrong with modern day society.  Same as with Perez.  Total no talents.
It's her own business, let it go hun.
The fact is if she’s already pregnant then let’s just support her. She has family… Tons of family living close by. She doesn’t have any addiction issues, why call out for her publicly to kill the baby?
Yeah, a half-nigger baby would look terrible.
First, she is 20 and financially stable.  Get your facts straight, you are embarrassing  yourself.  How dare you to act like this. The video is a joke and you are too. I can't deal with you and watch your language, when is it acceptable to speak like this? . No, she shouldn't have an abortion, why should the baby be killed?  Kylie made the choice to have a planned pregnancy or unprotected sex.  You said at end of your video that Kris Jenner's kid's are all grown up...I assume you mean their adults so why should Kylie that has her own home and empire kill this baby?  Who are you anyway? Why are you putting yourself in the middle this?  Why does your opinion matter?
I see lots of alimony in his future....
You're disgusting Perez Hilton. How misogynistic, pressuring her by saying she should have an abortion, and saying you would push the same misogyny on your own daughter. Pretty patriarchal!
This is hilarious LOL. Perez Hilton is the voice of reason here.
honestly you're the worst
It's sad that people look at baby's as a burden. I baby is a blessing and brings joy. I had my first child at 20 and she made my life better.  And you can still do anything you want with a child. Plus she is rich. Has her own home. Job. She is fully capable of being a mother. She's an adult not a child. What if kris aborted Kim, Kourtney, and kloe. She wouldn't have a TV show. Her kids helped make her who she is. Abortion is never the answer. It's selfish and cowardly! And this guy is what is wrong with the world!!
You are scum sucking bottom feeder. \nThis is way out of line.I'm not a fan of the Kardashians but this is so insensitive and wrong. Telling someone to have an abortion is so out of line! Abortion is not a casual topic to be thrown around.It's an insult to women and the fact that you take it casually to just blurt that out to be aired to the world reveals a lot about you. \nHope you are slammed for this.
Some girls just aren't meant to be moms. Kylie being number one on that list. I also don't see her dude sticking around or being in the kids life. He's with her for the publicity only,obviously. He's like Chyna👌🏻.
Do you realize that besides killing a baby... abortion HURTS women...physically, emotionally, spiritually?
Who the fuck cares stop worshipping celebrities
You act like Kylie Jenner is some dumb college student still living at home with mommy and daddy. She's done more in her career in just a few years than you have in your entire life. She makes it clear that she's not a party girl, she prefers to stay home. She clearly adores her nieces and nephews. I think she'll be a great mom. You are 100% a judgmental asshole. There are 20 year old girls who get pregnant all the time and they end up doing better for their children than 30 year old men and women who are married. So sit down and shut up.
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. Should she have gotten pregnant, no. Did she, yes. This is exactly why people are against abortion. It should not be used as birth control.
What Perez Hilton did to Kylie Jenner and her unborn baby over the weekend serves as a strong example of just how often women are pressured to abort their unborn babies. Hilton, a celebrity blogger, said he would have urged the 20-year-old reality show star to abort her unborn baby if she was his daughter, and he openly admitted that he would do the same if his own young daughter came to him pregnant in a similar situation.Rumors spread Friday of Jenner’s pregnancy with her fiance Travis Scott. However, Jenner had not confirmed the news as of Monday morning. In a YouTube video over the weekend, Hilton claims she will be a bad mother and her unborn baby is better off dead (in other words, being brutally chopped apart or dismembered and pulled out of the womb in an abortion).“I truly believe if I were Kris Jenner, the best option for Kylie and her future and for that child would have been for her to abort that baby,” Hilton said in the video. “… And I would say the same thing to my daughter if she were to get pregnant under similar circumstances: her age, not a stable relationship, her just being totally unfit to be pregnant, in my opinion.“Um, I love life, I love babies. If I were Kris Jenner, I would tell that girl to get an abortion!” he said at another point.Hilton faced sharp backlash, as well he should have. For someone who claims to be pro-choice, he is not promoting a choice for Jenner or his own daughter. He publicly admitted that he would pressure both of them to abort their unborn babies, rather than let the choice be theirs alone. It calls into question what would happen years down the road if his daughter came to him pregnant, asking for support and encouragement because she wanted to parent or make an adoption plan for her child.The truth is that many women and girls face heavy pressure to abort their unborn babies, often from their parents or a partner. All too often an abortion is not the “choice” that the abortion industry sells it as. A study in the Medical Science Monitor found that as many as 64 percent of post-abortive women say they felt pressured to have an abortion.People described Hilton’s comments as “beyond disgusting” and asked “why you telling a woman what to do with her body?” But he did not apologize.A few days later, Hilton tried to make things clear by uploading another video on his YouTube channel. The dad of two explained that he didn’t mean that Jenner should get an abortion right now, but it’s something that he would’ve encouraged her to do if he were her parent. The blogger continued by saying that the circumstances are not in Jenner’s favor since she’s still very young, and her relationship with Travis Scott is not stable.Hilton is a single dad to his children, Mario, 4, and Mia, 2 – who were both delivered via surrogates. In the video, he also said that if his daughter would tell him that she’s pregnant at a young age, he will also encourage her to get an abortion.Hilton’s comments expose how legalized abortion really is not about women’s rights or freedom. Too often, it’s about a boyfriend, husband or father trying to escape their responsibilities by pushing a medically invasive procedure that kills a member of their family and injures another.These types of attitudes are precisely what the early feminists were referring to when they called abortion the “ultimate exploitation of women.” As Hilton’s rant proves, even women in the richest, most privileged families in the world are not receiving the support that they and their babies deserve.
The whole of America should do to the the Kardashian clan in the streets what was done to Moussilini, the Romanovs, or the French Monarchy. It's the only way to make it stop.
it's not our say , to make sure she has the child or not. She's 20. She's got such a fantastic business which is worth oh god I think billions by now? She's financially stable. She loves kids and is amazing with kids. She has a house. She has a supportive family. Their are 16 year olds getting pregnant!! Why is she being told all these things! We have no right whatsoever to say such things,it's not our place!! It's her families judgement. Come on guys theirs more serious things going on around the world like TRUMP STARTING UP WW3!!!
The baby's gonna come out 100% silicon.
I think he just said what everybody was thinking. Hurtful or not it was honest.
I agree with the abortion lol that guy is a thug and will ruin her life
she’s an idiot. & she should’ve aborted.
Abortion is not the answer how about ADOPTION
THIS IS GOLD!!!! I didnt even THINK about the whole Rob Kardashian Blac Chyna baby! Its a FAME OFF!
Lost all respect for Perez Hilton after this video. Fuck you “man”.
oh Perez...these people are sooo rich=its not like its a regular girl. im sure you are gonna get a lot of flak for the abortion comment! iy mijo.
I met my husband at 18. Pregnant after two months of knowing him. 9 years later. We are still together! I am grateful to have a blessed family!
This is the first video I have ever seen by Perez Hilton, always seen the website before videos. I agree with you Perez! You hit every important topic
I dont think you should state that you love life and then turn around to tell someone to have an abortion
There is no replacement for a child's biological mother and/or father.
It is nothing short of disgusting that you would suggest kylie get an abortion just because shes a young mother. Never mind the fact that she has millions of dollars to throw at raising this kid, but there are literally millions of 20yr old single mothers who bust their asses to raise amazing kids with much less than kylie already has. you have to be an unbelievably large piece of shit to suggest getting an abortion to a woman who has already established that she wants to keep her kid. but straight up in a few months youre gonna be publishing stories about the kid when their born?
Honestly.  Your mother should abort you.  Now.  With as large a caliber firearm as she can get her hands on.
Shut the fuck up.  Man you people who are so obsessed with other's lives and what they do with it is so fucking pathetic.  YOU people are exactly what's wrong with this country.  Hollywood, celebrities, people who are famous for not doing a fucking thing for society, Et Al. \n\nGO FUCKING KILL YOURSELF.
Well of course this faggot would tell a woman to kill her baby.  His relationships arent pro life, he fucks assholes and ejaculates into  bowels full of shit on a regular basis, no life can come out of that.  So im not surprised at all that a gay man isnt pro life.
Who is this 'guy' is he famous?
Man (girl?) you are so irrelevant... just go away and hide no one cares what you think
This disgusting human being has childen?  Perez Hilton is the lowest scum.
why do you hate women
Dude honestly, babies are born everyday to abusive and drug addict  parents but you feel bad for the Kardashian kids? I'm sure their kids are fine probably better than fine. Also, people have kids younger than Kylie and are AMAZING parents. Stop. I understand it's your job to gossip but  negativity is unnecessary.
While I do think Kylie is too young and in a very new relationship, I do find it funny how you are judging her because her relationship may not last long. Don't you have 2 kids and  no spouse? That makes you a hypocrite.
So because she's not going to end up with her baby daddy, she should get rid of the baby?  Wth?
Chris is probably happy!!!!!!!!  I can't see her being a good mom she is not MATURE ENOUGH for that responsibility!!!! she will let Chris raise the baby  most of the time!!! Hopefully she will surprise everyone and be a good mother.she is going to have to learn fast.and buy the land and house. She said she wanted to raise a family away from paparazzi.whats sad is she thinks this guys is going to help raise their child together.he will make every excuse to get out of helping to raise their child!!! So she may be on her own unless that's the way she wants it??  What ever her choice good luck to her I wish her the very Best for the innocent baby's sake.from Michigan
She's probably just bored. She's just turned 20 and probably already has everything she wants in life. Having a baby should spice things up and add some purpose back into her sad and dull life.
I agree with you Perez! Why would she downgrade and settle for a nigger kid? It's NUTS....
How NEVER LEARN what’s appropriate and what’s NOT to say to THOUSANDS of young people. What an IDIOT. Way to ENCOURAGE abortion. I’m pro choice, but I don’t go around making ignorant statements like he does here. MORON.
Ok so this guy comes across like a complete loser, I haven't watched any of his videos before but the vibe I get is 'woo views good for business I'm a loser I have nothing else going for myself' 😒😒 just my first impression. Do not like him
I agree with everything u said. ExCEPT the abortion.  👎 \nHow could her having a baby is bad. \nI think she will be fine.
I for one would like to congratulate Kylie & Travis on their brand new business baby!!
Idk how y'all like him. I find this man disgusting, an abortion? if she decides she wants HER baby it's none of YOUR fkn business. If she decides she wants the baby despite not knowing Scott for a long time it's stilllll (dun dun dun)...NONE OF YOUR FKN BUSINESS. discussing someone else's life just because you ran out of ideas for your channel is not cool man.
What the fuck, you have NO right to tell Kylie or ANYONE to get an abortion, abortion is an option choice yes but, you still have no right, and what the fuck you feel bad for the baby honestly fuck you! And you have a right to state your opinion but that's all you have... still no right to tell or ask like??!! So don't you dare talk about parenthood, YOU HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA HAW MANY PERANTS CANT HAVE KIDS, soo you bitch shut your ass up and your an adult and your gossiping on KYLIE JENNER REALLY BRUH.. please bruh please.
You can't just kill a baby that is wrong
I thought she was 20
Mixed race kids are so gross LOL
What's up with those women and their love of bbc? It's as if they can't get enough of bbc. They'd do anything for bbc. I'm happy for Kylie. Travis Scott is a great guy.
She probably did it to accumulate fat for a fat transfer
The beginning of the video is my reaction to the news as well lol
You're seriously a piece of shit!!!!
Saying that someone should get an abortion is essentially the same as saying someone shouldn't be gay. It isn't you, your choice, or your life. People make their own decisions, and instead of trying to live someone else's life you should probably stick to living your own. I don't keep up with her or any of the other Kardashians, and obviously you shouldn't either; because you find that it's your place to tell a mother whether or not her baby should live or die. May I suggest unplugging for a bit and living your own life for a bit? Perhaps not. But that's what I get for keeping up with you.
Your a fuckwitt Perez Hilton!!!!! Your a single father so if she doesn't last with him why does it matter???? Your so cruel.
who even are u
You are fucking disgusting that all i have to say
don't you have anything better to do ! mind your own bisnes ! I think you have plenty to do in that section...
All of these young girls on this comment thread defending Kylie. This looks horrific, money doesn’t make you a good mom. Imagine being a regular girl at 20, in the middle of college and getting pregnant by some guy you hardly know. Would you be happy with yourself? Would your parents be happy? You hardly know yourself at 20. I’m 17 and even I know that I’m hardly gonna know what to do with my self in 2.5 years at 20... a kid? Hell no. Girls, your idol should not be a young girl who gets pregnant by a rapper at 20. No matter how much money she has.
I love this! It’s honest & exactly how I feel... I may be hypocritical... But idgaf
I'M SICK AND TIRED OF Y'ALL IGNORANT ASS PEOPLE SAYING SHE GOT PREGNANT ON PURPOSE OR THAT SHE WOULDN'T BE A GOOD MOM, ETC. Y'ALL DON'T KNO HER ON A PERSONAL LEVEL AND YEA NEITHER DO I BUT DONT MEAN Y'ALL RATCHET ASSES GOTTA ALWAYS SAY SOME MEAN CRAP. WOMEN WHO GO THRU PREGNANCIES AND BIRTHS ETC ARE THE STRONGEST WOMEN ON EARTH MOMMIES ARE THE STRONGEST!! Even if she did get pregnant on purpse WHO GIVES A FLYING FUCK! ITS HER GOD DAMN LIFE she can handle it financially and she will have tremendous support from the fam! SO STFU AND GO ON WITH UR GOD DAMN LIFE U ASSHOLES! Damn!
Bottom line is, she needs an abortion. Kylie Jenner will not be a good mother. For those of you who know why will understand and to those of you who support Kylie never will. 100% support Perez.
Who the fuck is this irrelevant pig?
What if someone told you to abort your child???
she's 20 not 19 and my mom gave birth to me when she was 17... I got disciplined plenty enough. You have a child... what's the difference between you have a child that neither you or your partner actually gave birth to and Kylie having a baby. I'm not even a fan of the kardasians but you're just a twat. Maybe your mother or the surrogate mother to your child should have had an abortion... especially having to have a father like you.
Idc what anyone says I think Kylie and Travis planned this Travis sees Kylie as real life treasure she has the money she's it girl Travis is not the best looking thing but he feels the shit because Kylie is gorgeous if Travis didn't have money and fame no high end celebrity like Rihanna or Kylie would date him I think Travis is taking advantage of her he seems dollar signs kylie maybe finically ready but relatively mentally not ready having a baby is not a something to try to fill the void I feel sorry for Kylie here family clearly doesn't respect her her mom only cRs about money and dad only cares about himself
You're immature and rude, who really cares about your opinion, I just click to see how stupid you look and what nonsense you say. It's not your buisness so why does it matter???
Honestly, I just want to get this off my chest, but telling people to get abortions is wrong. I mean this is Kylie's first time having a baby but I think that she might be a good mum. If people keep telling people to get abortions how will have more people? I may think she's doing this for publicity. This is just my opinion.
For once I agree with Perez.
I swear these Kardashians do ANYTHING to keep themselves relevant and in the news.

Best video Ever

What a disgusting video.
like mother, sisters, all garbage.
Too bad ur mom didn't abort ur cancerous kweer fetus
This is sooo funny loool
You're a monster. Just because that baby looks like an inconvenience to you, that's a good reason to kill a child?! Fuck no! You're a monster! If she's pregnant, she most likely wanted to become pregnant. Kylie always said she wanted to be a young mom. You're just absolutely disgusting and the way you look at life is just horrendous and horrible. Fuck you! Fuck your evil views! That girl will be a good mother whenever she gives birth the her child. And if the relationship with her boyfriend doesn't last, that kid will still be surrounded by a ton of love from his aunts and cousins.
I'm really surprised that Kylie Jenner is pregnant ,I know  her dad problem isn't  happy with the News . I'm shocked,that really is too Bad!
Wow you are so repugnant. Kylie is pro-choice, and she chose. Because of her choice, her baby girl is going to be born, grow into a functioning human being, and one day know about your disgusting commentary about her. Hopefully she becomes a strong enough woman so that she doesn’t feel any less human because she, “should have been aborted, shouldn’t she?” How ugly of you.
They're adults, they're screaming like little Georgies, I'm 13 and I'm quiet as giant pennywise
id rather gouge out my eyeballs than go to movies to see IT with these fucking retards.
FUcking pussies dude that wasnt even that scart i watched it with my friends and the theater was quiet
0:26 they're not screaming at the movie they're screaming at PennyWise you can see his hand at 0:26 I'd be pretty fuckin scared if a clown that had six rows of teeth got all up in my face. Lmao I am aware it's a cosplayer but they could've used something to make all those teeth Just look at where the audience Is looking around and you'll see a hand in a glove.
I'm ten and I was laughing during the death scenes
Lol it wasn't that fucking scary
In my theatre I was the only under aged person *13* and nobody, not even me, screamed once during the movie :/ like no joke I was laughing at the jump scares cause they were funny to me 😂👌
The film is overrated I wouldn't call it a horror.
in my movie theater everyone was hella quiet, bitch these are actors
That is just sad....
I don't get why everyone jumped out of there seats I'm 13 and I just sat in my seat........didnt flinch
Bro I'm so glad I wasn't there
Ok movie was fantastic but not that scary
I saw it it was not scary
It good ass movie but come on it not scary at all
Pinches llorones los gringos
Wow there adults im 9 and i enjoyed it instead of screaming
The movies wasn't even that scary, these people are all pansys
Oh please. This movie was not scary at all.
when I went to see it everyone was mostly laughing then screaming...there alot of funny parts.
It wasn't even that scary.it was more creepy then scary.
the movie wasn't even scary.
I’m twelve I watched and I only got jumped scared once and that’s when Beverly turned around and pennywise caught her
Wow fucking pussies, i would be so pissed if i was in this crowd, i want to enjoy the movie not your godamn screams, and the movie is not that scary
If people r 😱 scared why didn't they just leave 🤷🏾‍♀️
IT'S NOT EVEN THAT SCARY!!!
im a good shet the movie  that i watched was 2-p[3iou[2ip3o1u2[8031824 coolrigt
Comment chart of this video :3\n\n80% saying the movie is not scary and that the vid is fake\n10% Comparing The two ITS\n5% random links.\n5% gay fucking shit thats being said
Na minha cidade quase ninguém tomou esses sustos no dia que eu assisti
GUYS they are sooo scared because an clown(not the actual)came you can clearly see at 00:26
The movie produced an uneasy feeling through out, but wasn't scary in the sense of a slasher ghost film to be screaming like this (let's face it even those movies aren't scary at all) what I loved was that it didn't focus on jump scares. It had great character development, and this version the acting was great and focused a lot more on coming of age film (which I found refreshing) for such a creepy book. With some very creepy moments. Had a great mixture of heart mixed with horror. These people are trying way to hard and most likely didn't savor the film. Just focused on getting attention for themselves! If you all haven't seen this yet, go in with the mindset that you'll be watching a drama film, with wonderful acting and characters, with some creepy moments here and there.
WTF really?? The movie wasn't even scary. It was definitely entertaining, worth my money and time but it was no where near as scary as how they make out to be. Typical white girls screaming at everything.
IT was not scary at all like dafuq are they doin?
honestly i loved the movie, but i was not scared ;__;
Lmao everyone in the cinema I was at was either quiet or laughing  tf
Im gonna see the movie\n*After the video*\nMan, fuck this shit im gonna download this from Internet
What's with the autistic crowd ?
I'm twelve and didn't scream once
I'd pay extra for a movie theater to have set balloon pops and physical thrills like this :D
funny if it was me I would have scream and then thrown my soda at him and tackled him
It's just the loud pussyass women screaming
Si ello se asustan con it no que raras ver el silbón en Venezuela
The only creepy scene was the flute lady
It was not that scary....went home n slept like a baby lol but movie was good
We all float down HERE.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll float, TOO.
I swear to god if a nigga start screaming like a lil bitch at my theaters imma have to beat his ass
This movie was scary but these people are wussy lol.
the movie was amazing but not that scary. I flinched at a few jump scares but mostly i laughed cuz it was so funny. I don't think anyone in the audience screamed
Let me be he first to say that I saw the movie and it was actually really shIT.
It's not even scary 😂
I'm 7 and i w
Where i saw it no one screamed at all
Watched it today...it was shit...no plot...
Lmao this is so fake. When I went to see it, everyone was laughing at the way he runs, jumps, etc. Especially during the dance scene.
These white people are dumb

I did not find this movie the least bit scary it was funny af. However, these reactions are true. People next to me in cinema kept screaming at every scene. Girls tend to get scared more easily I swear -.-
Does it show how he kills him ?
I haven't even watched it.... but this is on my recommended
It would piss me right off if i had to sut through a film with that lot freaking out & screaming like that😩
Well, I guess my voice was the only thing you heard if you watched the movie with me... *Screaming like crazy*
I would hate to watch it with these people
Tbh it wasn't that scary
I'm the only one who will not see this movie 👍🏻👍🏻😭
dear god! that'show i felt when i saw the movie yesterday
The  it  movie was not scary what so ever more so comedic
Seen the film and the reaction was nothing like that.  This is way over the top!
Oh my God my little brother is 12 and he didn't scream or piss himself
It was a great film, but it wasn't that fucking scary
Mate. The only time a genuine and freaky reaction ever occurred in a movie theatre was when the exorcist was out.
25 seconds in you can see a clown scaring people at the back
I hope the movie is scary because I'm seeing this tomorrow and it will be my first time seeing a horror movie in theatres so I hope either a clown scares people in the theatre or the movie is really scary plus it is already scary because I hate clowns.
At least make it look real
If someone sat infront of me whit a damn balloon they'd fucking float too
God, fuck you if hold a balloon up in the pictures.
You'll float too you'll float too you'll floats to You'll float too YOU'LL FLOAT TOOOOOO!
The movie want even scary
The film was scary but it wasn’t to the point where I or anyone would audibly scream so either this is fake or they got a bunch of easily scared people and said we will pay you to see it
I think they were paid to scream.
Standard film over hyped money spinner this film wasn't one bit scary these audiences members must live sheltered lives to be scared of that shit
How are they screaming?! Like. The only time I screamed, was when I was laughing too hard.
Obviously none you know what the purpose of IT is. IT is not meant to be scary or have jumpscares. IT is suppose to completely freak you out and make people go home to not be completely scared, but more aware and to have nightmares. Movies nowadays has got it stuck in peoples head that since it's a horror movie it has to be scary and it has to have jumpscares, but what IT does is totally separate from any other horror movies out there and that is that IT makes you wonder and the crew knows that the unknown is this scariest thing to alot of people. Just wanted let most you guys know what IT was created for, the director and creator of IT says this.
Either this is fake or the people in the vid are the biggest pussies ever
You'll float down here if your either supernatural or lighter than water
Ahhhhh
Enserio, cuánto le pagaron?
awesome
Jesus christ everyone at my theater didnt even FLINCH

Overreacting
White people
Over exaggerating peeps

People are pathetic
que pendejos estan estos
This lying dude is back
Fake af
If  Pennywise Told me to come down here you'll float to I would of said NAW NIGGA I'LL SINK
I HAVE TO WATCH THE NEW IT NOW
I feel like if they weren't gonna elaborate on Patrick they didn't really need to include him in the movie. And I like the old Henry bowers. But I also like the Original Mini series whereas most people apparently don't lol
lol, at #2, the movie only got a 14A rating here in Canada. We are so lax with our ratings system, it's weird o.O
You're dead fat boy!
I like the more happy go lucky clown with the dark interior.
His eye brows better than mine will ever be
Tim Curry was the only thing that saved the mini series.
Mostly all the character's are my age 2017 version
You'll float to 😈
The new it is absolutely a improvement of the older one! Who agrees?
AND THE SAME AGE WTH
Ballon 🎈this is it🙇this is it he like come or I take you money baster 🚶🔫🔪🔫🔫wow money 💰🔪
I float better with Ice because I'm cold like Sub Zeroooooooo !
Didn’t care for the 2017 version at all
My mom and I saw the new one yesterday and we watched the old one today and we were saying how mush different they are
Hi Georgie what a nice boat do you want it back? You look like i nice boy i bet you have alotof friends. Where is he? I bet i can make him feel better i'll give him a balloon do you want a balloon, too georgie? Well i'm pennywise the dancing clown pennywise yes meet Georgie georgie meet pennywise. There's all sorts of circus can you smell the circus Georgie? There's candy gotten candy annnnnnnd popcorn is that your favorite? Mine, too because they pop pop pop pop pop pop pop hahahahaha! With out your boat? Bills gonna kill you. Here take it
But hey, Stephen King is the king a horror for a reason : Comedy-Watchmojo2017
The house on Neibolt street house, just never mentioned what it was. Pretty sure the house Stan gets locked in and sees it in, is that house.
there arent words to explain how much i enjoyed this movie
See y'all in 27 years
You'll float to\nYOU'LL float too\nYOU'LL FLOAT TO
Great movie. Love it. I’m Hunting the Funko pops of pennywise. I got videos of Hunting them lol
1990: yeah we don't want them mixing blood cuz of how popular AIDS are even tho it takes place in the 50s.\n\n2017: We'll show them mixing blood cause AIDS isn't as serious as it used to be even tho it takes place when AIDS was popular.\n\nseriously tho...this is a lil bullshit😂
I feel like Tim Curry Pennywise is still the best, I mean Bills Skarsgard Pennywise did do a great job with the looks in my opinion but they kinda exaggerated the sfx on the character although Tim Curry wasn't that scary to me but still captivated and made me more or less surprised if thats the right word? I still feel like it was the book that reeled me in to the It series.
In Australia it's MA15+
The miniseries took the Neibolt House and put it in Memorial Park in place of the Stand Pipe.
i have the First Movie IT
You forgot one was good the other is the miniseries.
It better not come out 27 years from now
Can anyone send me full link of IT (2017)? Tnx
I think should be a The shining remake.
IT 2017 was actually good. there's a big difference that you missed.
Something old galaxy slip seed engineer survey music.
2017 was sooooooo funny especially Richie aka Finn and Eddie aka jack
Yay I saw 3 Green Day albums in the back ground :D
ALSO Beverly is more with Bill then Beverly with Ben
The Barrens was totally underplayed. Still no smoke hole or any indication of It's origin. No Ritual of Chüd.
I wont float too im way to fat
How are they going to make part 2 scarier?  They all grew immune to the fear pennywise introduced.  So what fear as adults can be in a horror film?
I've never heard this channel cuss before
the IT clown in 1990 looks lioe the clown of mcdonalds lol
Patrick is gay, everyone saw his smile and him lick his lips right?
2017 legit scares the shit out of me lol......and I love horror.
Is it bad that ...I have not seen EITHER of the movies, nor read the book
ok im confused this video says Beverly has sex in the book some other IT video said Beverly was gang raped in the book, either way I don't look forward to reading that
pennywise comes out every 27 years.it has been 27 years.Coincidence i think not
scarier no just ore gross and 2017 left a lot of important parts of the book
For the people that say he needs to lure the kids are correct but he also feeds on fear so he needs to scare them last second so he can eat em
For the final time the original was not a series it was a fucking movie
the 2017 IT is not even scary
The old one is so dumb but the book and the new movie are great
Wow, the new penny wise was in a really high definition in the thumbnail
Raise your hand if you're excited for chapter 2 ✋🏼
hey did they actually manage to make the remake better than the original? wow. seems a lot scarier and truer to the book.
wait, if the new it took place in the late 80's, i think the sequel will be 27 years from then! the time in the sequel will be the year it releases
I watched this movie and the original
The motivation for Billy in 2017 IT was so much stronger.  A child trying to find his little brother because no one else will is so much stronger and heartfelt than a boy seeking revenge.
*does it float doe?*
*Beep Beep Richie!*
RIP GEORGIE 😭😭😭☠💀

Only problem with the new adaption is how silly Pennywise often was. It removed a lot of the tension. Like his silly dance in the sewers? The silly way Georgie shook before starting to grow clown clothes? His silly stuck faces during chase/fight scenes? A bit too much but still a great overall horror movie.
It doesn't smell like Caca to me sen your
“Suck him dry”
LoL
I love how its R in I'm guessing America and over here in Australia were like don't be a little bitch, Go watch it at the cinema MA15+ Iv seen it twice XD so good
0:22 Clown: Hey kid! Do you saw my camera?
pretty sure the neiman house was the one stan went into in part 2 of the original movie
I hate the new Pennywise actor.
2017 IT \nis funnyyyy😂😂😂

This movie is better then the mini series overal xD
The original it movie better than the 2017 it movie
Who fucking cares they remade it means it was a good movie and people gave a shit about it enough to do a remake
I would rather see the blood oath than something borderline child porn
And don't forget, the 2017 Pennywise also lived up to his name Pennywise the DANCING clown by dancing shortly for Bev
*You'll float too*

xmas story is fucking awesome, In the UK barely anyone i know have heard of it. I am the only person i know and had to show them
I agree almost with everything on your list, but not with Pulp Fiction and Matrix! Citizen Kane would be No. 1 on my list - I absolutely cannot understand how this garbage is so much appreciated from film makers etc. You mentioned also vertigo and north by northwest as movies you like a lot - I agree with that too - these are for me the two best movies ever made. I'm a huge fan of Hitchcock movies. I'm 41 btw. if that matters to my opinion.
That Donnie Darko shot was a punch to the gut but I understand, it's not the easiest movie to get into.
Godfather 2 matrix and lebowski are amazing imo. It's interesting to know that James isn't a fan. Well at least you didn't say my favs, Blade runner and Brazil. Good video.
I agree with all your picks except Donnie Darko. I even watched the crappy sequel. A lot of these movies are good popcorn movies that you watch once then walk away. All movies made in Hollywood, recently, have been the blockbuster throw away movies. No rewatchability. No risk. You experience it, then nothing.
I'm agree in all the movies on the list, except for number 10, I never watch it
Damn James, these were all surprising picks for the most part... Except Donnie Darko. I totally feel you on that one. I never understood the hype with that one. Same with Requiem for a Dream.
There Will Be Blood
I think I may have already said this, but I am with you on Big Lebowski. The movie is just kinda dumb I thought. A few funny bits, but a masterpiece? I think not
You had me until Christmas story
I can only imagine you must have Lebowski-fatigue, James.
Batman 1989 > every batman movie, 90s wb cartoon, brave and the bold , every DC animated movie with batman, that docmentary about bill finger and every batman movie that will come out in the next 4354839073934802 years
Holy shit that disclaimer was so long and unnecessary. It's ok to upset some sensitive assbiscuits
Dang it, I was right there with you tacking along word for word, and then you Lebowski'd me.  HOW DARE YOU IN GOOD CONSCIENCE SIR!
The dark knight.... (ok calm down is just an opinion, don't be so inmature, every point of view is worth of respect and... and...) WTF JAMES!!! HOW COULD YOU!!!
I've never liked any of Tarentino's films. I mean, yeah there are some good lines, going back to Pull Fiction's cheeseburger stuff and so on, but it all just feels like an excuse for over the top violence without rhyme or reason.
Gandhi is overrated Yeah. I mean, he made one great film and then you never saw him again.
Orson wells' the trial is better than citizen Kane
If You want to know why the Pulp fiction is so beloved watch Earthling Cinemas analysis of Pulp Fiction.
the new ghostbusters is better than the original. its fresher and more topical.
I agree with your assessment of Godfather II.  I would take Goodfellas over any of the Godfather movies.  Goodfellas portrays the Mafia in a more realistic light instead of romanticizing it as Godfather did.
I respect your opinion, but I really loved the Dark Knight. It's just so dramatic and epic
Beetlejuice is overrated as fuck. There, i said it. Not bad, but definately not the best.
I agree on Titanic. I feel the people who worship it haven't seen it in ages because the film is too damn long it just drags people probably just fast forward to hear the song at the end.
I count Die Hard as a Christmas movie, 2nd on my list only to Home Alone....
The Matrix?! Jesus, I didn't see that coming
Your summed up reason for not liking Matrix was because people made a parody out of the slowmotion bulled dodging. Why would you let that have any effect on your opinion of the movie?
I don't like Star Wars.
The Dark Knight is a bit personal. It's one of the best films of the millenia. An incredible story and directing by Nolan. Well told themes and still very relevant film about terrorism today. No comic book or superhero film has ever reached such heights IMO. It's one of those rare films that's a big blockbuster film but at the same time is a brilliantly made piece of cinema. Nolan's films since TDK, to me, are manuals for hollywood to make big budget filims more than just dumb entertainment. It can be art as well.
I don't understand the love for Vertigo, honestly.
I think you take the term one of the best of all time a little too seriously. You should really think of this term as one of my personal favorites, no matter what the person saying it really means. Opinions on movies are mostly subjective. Yes, you can list obvious flaws and praises for a movie's qualities, but at the end of the day it's a matter of taste: you either enjoyed it for what it was, or not. It can never be deduced to a definitive answer.
I'd say, sure, they are enjoyable movies, but they ain't top 20 worthy. Should do top 10 shit movies, top 10 Troma movies? Maybe even subgenere Troma down into musicals and such...
I actually 100% agree with this. I don't hate any of these movies and like most of them. Like you said, I'm just confused as to why most of them are so big.
Im sorry nerd but you didn't have enough teenage angst to understand Donnie Darko. Paradoxes, prophecies, rebels and a angsty hero.
Prometheus and Alien Covenant for me. Both good but I’ll never consider them classics.
I watch a Christmas story every year ever since I was a child 😂
I love Pulp Fiction even though I love Reservoir Dogs better. Donnie Darko is also awesome.
Couldn't watch the video after the intro. Didn't want to get pissed.
I think Resivoir Dogs should have been here also!
Where's the Shit er uh the Shinning
holy fuck HOME ALONE IS SHIT
maybe it's because they gave me massive panic attacks when i watched 'em as a kid but i have always hated E.T. and home alone and everyone loves 'em and wants to watch 'em and i'm like h m m
Anybody remember when he had Citizen Kane in his top favorite movies video?
When does the video start
I agree with everything except dark  Knight and Donnie Darko.
Completely agree with Pulp Fiction, The Matrix, Donnie Darko, Batman and Sixth Sense. \n\nGreetings <3
It is like how I don't love the princess bride or jurrasic park and people want to burn me at the stake.
I'm just glad Goodfellas isn't on your list cause I would of got triggered
Yes, it's called every movie that comes out now.
I think No Country for Old Men I couldn't watch it to the end. When Tommy Lee Jones goes off on his soliloquy, I lost total interest in it.
This is me with Rick and Morty
People take things too far, sometimes. Becoming a character from a movie? That's something a kid would do, but an adult? Strange.
Agree with every movie on the list.  Seriously.  Especially Lebowski, Pulp Fiction, Matrix.  Damn, have the same film tastes.  Except, you should have found a way to inject Boondock Saints, True Romance and Napoleon Dynamite.  Next\n\n time, top 20!
I agree with Kane, Dark Knight and Lebowski. Nice Video (Y)
Everyone likes it ,so I don't.
Woah, a lot of drama in the comments section.
This aggression will not stand.
Dark Knight is the most overratted film of all time.\n\nI love The Matrix and Donnie Darko though.
Disagree with this list.
I agree with everyone of these except I love big lebowski. Dark knight would have been complete trash without heath ledger, Sixth sense is m knight shamalamalom...enough said, matrix is over rated, titanic is for girls, pulp fiction told the story out of order and had sam Jackson cussing a lot...big fuckin deal. Godfather 1 was way better than 2 and Christmas vacation is a way better holiday movie than a Christmas story and Donnie darko was mediocre
I disagree with almost everything you just said but that's cool.
this was all spot on man! clerks is one of mine
I love your stuff James, but I have to say I disagree with about 90% of your list.  Probably the big one I do agree with you on Big Lebowski and Titanic. Thanks though for the video.
Nailed it when you started talking about The Goodfellas and Scarface, couldn't agree more.
i found Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and Inglorious Basterds all kinda like how James feels about PF, but i certainly did love me some Django
I was on board with you until Donnie Darko and Lebowski, literally 2 of my favorite movies. Lol. But , to quote the Dude, That's just like, your opinion, Man. I respect your opinion though, good video.
Dude....Ive been following you for years..love your work.....But what in the entire fuck are you talking about!???
the opening of this video is so pretentious
I jumped ship from this list at the Sixth Sense.
I'm a huge Star Wars fan but The Force Awakens is just pure shit for me.
I fucking knew Donnie Darko was going to be on this list! What the fuck, Tim!?
God damn, I was ready to disagree and make my counterpoints but actually agreed with just about everything. Haven't seen Titanic or A Christmas Story though. I also think Pulp Fiction is good, but not great. Reservoir Dogs was way better.
I dont like fight club
I started the video and was really agreeing with most of these picks... then I was literally thinking in my head this is a good list, I'm sure he won't have any truly great films on here like The Matrix.... next film was The Matrix.  I wanted to flip my coffee table.\n\nAll good though I agree with most of your picks!  A lot of these movies seem so overrated to me too... especially Donnie Darko... but to each their own.
Everything you said about Christmas story is exactly how I feel. Because of the 24 Hour Loop I've only seen it in parts, every time I go to my cousins house for the holidays. Got so sick of it it's killed my enthusiasm for seeing the movie all the way through. Nowadays I just sign up for overtime on the holidays just so I can avoid it.
donnie darko. I have watched it 10 times now and I cant see why is so amazing. It's confuse as hell and I'm a physics student and I find most of the movie bullshit about time travel.
Best christmas movie: Die Hard
that was a bold move, James
I totally agree on everything accept a Christmas Story,  but i always thought i was the odd-ball for loving it so much
I must admit i was shocked to see TBL on your list! But then again King Kong is your favourite movie...
I agreed with a lot of these movies on here. I have an unoriginal favourite of the Matrix being in my tops. It's just a cool movie but it's not an incredible film or anything. I very much agree with you on Pulp fiction, I think it's one of the weakest movies from T
One of the movies for me is the Shawshank redemption. It's a good movie but it's not as good as it's made out to be. Does not deserve number 1 on imdb

I re-watched The Matrix a week ago because my (much younger) GF had never seen it, and I've got to say, it was VERY heavy-handed with all the stuff about being The One, which I now found very corny and off-putting. I think it was much more powerful when I was younger and the concepts it explores were new to me. It was much more dramatic at 14 years old. These days I still think the Ghost In the Shell inspired aesthetic of it is pretty cool, and it creates an interesting world, but a lot of the punch is gone.\n\n(and both of the sequels are complete trash. Yes, Reloaded SUCKS, not just Revolutions)
I don't know why \nBut i knew titanic would be in this list
I agree on all of the above especially The Dark Knight, which in fact the deeper meaning is that Heath Ledger died. If he wouldn't have died this movie would be forgotten. \nBut I also believe that Terminator 2 belongs on this list as well.
I'm right there with you on The Big Lebowski and The Dark Knight Returns. Good films but people go apeshit and I don't get it. Then again I love Joe Dirt, Bubble Boy and Maximum Overdrive. Maybe I'm not the best judge of great films...
Mine is Blade Runner. I've never been able to finish it.
Agree with the dark knight. It was good. That's it. Also Deadpool. It was ok. I don't understand why everyone has a hard on for it calling it a masterpiece. It's not. It's just an ok movie
My cats 17 and still gets playful from time to time
when i use a laser pointer, my cat looks at my hand, not the dot.
I've used my socks many times. They seem to know to not attack my feet once the socks are on. At least...I think so anyway...
My cat just sleeps all day and then plays for one hour and goes back to sleep outside for the night
Tsunami loves stick.
My favourite chanel on youtube :-)
Not using hand or feet is definitely a good idea. My first cat hadn't had any toys or the previous owner got him as a kitten and never taught him to play with toys. Result: in the beginning he mauled my hands and forearms so badly during play that one day a workmate took me aside and asked veeeery cautiously if I needed any help or someone to talk because she had noticed the injuries on my arms. I explained it to her and then we had a good laugh. Still admire her for approaching me thinking I was self-harming.
My cat will occasionally play with mouse toys or treat balls but she goes nuts over the fishing rod toy, especially the ones with feathers. Since she's really into anything that flies around I've been thinking of getting a little mini drone so that she can chase it around the house.
não revelei nome\nnão te preocopes
My cat keke had a multitude of fuzzy balls.  She would find one and bring it to me and meow till I picked it up and threw it.  She loved playing fetch with it.  She would always bring it back for me to throw again, and again, till I would get tired. HA!
My cat loves to hide in plastic bags and lick them :3
Hahahaha! 😂😂😂😂💜💕🐾 Thanks for the laugh!
my tuddy doesn't  seemcto wantvto play with ANYthing.....😕😕😕😕😕
😸😸😸
😜😜😜😜😜😜😜😜😜

PMSL 100%
Im watching simons cat since 2011
hey nice video
Cats and babies= angels.
My cats are gumps
Georgie use to love playing with the red dot laser. Until....he saw the laser in my hand and lost all interest. After that I never got him to play with the red dot laser. No matter what.
One of my cats like fishing rod toys and anything with a bell/rattle. His brother loves to play fetch with crinkle balls.
Strings, this small remote control car I have, boxes, teaser wands with feathers and laser pointers....These are the toys my cat likes! Give him a ball or a catnip mouse and he looks at you like you've gone insane! XD
My cat likes the milk bottle plastic caps  lol
We love the laser toy at our house, but we must enforce share-time. Our black lab loves the laser toy too and goes so crazy the cats are in peril of death as she runs frantically into their laser game. We have had to make our dog wait and watch will the cats get to play with the laser toy. Then in a few minutes it's the dog's turn and the cats back off into a rough circle to watch her craziness. We have never ended the laser game by landing the dot on another toy for the cat's to feel success. Good idea we will try next time.
One of our cat's favorite games is for him to initiate by doing the little war-dance hop down the hallway, stop at the end and wait for you, then you raise your arms and chase him yelling ooga booga booga! The last part is, apparently, important, as he has decided that noise is a signal that you really are just playing, and that he is allowed to chase back when you start to move the other way. Unfortunately, even though he loves strings, we've had to forbid them as he tries to eat them.
I am so glad your still around :) these r funny and just resubbed :) was watching these when u first made an account but life got in the way.
my cat LOOOOVES small balls made from aluminium foil. Damn, she can play with them all day long. I have them everywhere
I thought our cat was the only one that kept hitting bouncy balls under the fridge and lounge.
My old and usually very docile Bengal attacks my legs if I don't let him catch the string toy fast enough. He thinks that is teasing him, while I just think he needs exercise.  Usually I humor him 'cause I don't want him to feel teased.

I can watch the lazer skit 20 times and laugh each time. 😸
My cat fetched sticks from our garden and brings them inside. She always meows loudly, to show off what she's brought us 😛 and then we play with her with those sticks. Cheap and fun 😂
My cat likes the laser light, but she loves the plastic caps from soda bottles. She could play fetch with those all day. She had a certain type of toy mice that she would play with, they changed the make of them and she won't have anything to do with them any more. The only actual toy she will play with is the the fishing rod one.  I did have cat that played with the laser for a while, until she found out where the light was coming from and refused to play with after that.
What qualifications do you need to be a cat expert? I want them lol
Just adopoted a 4-year old. Doesn't now how to play, but has not lost instinct to chase. She runs, then hides when she catches something! I think in her former life she was restricted and will take time to lose her fear. PS I can say this in French and Spanish too, but don't know cat.
I bought many toys but Pinky is only intrested for seagull futhers....... So I try to find as many as I can every summer to have stock for the winter.!!!
1:15 ... a cat called Nigel ...?\n\nYay!\n\n... and he is a cutie ...
My cat, Eleanor, has a fishing rod toy that she loves. It has a stuffed Millenium Falcon that she loves to pick up and drag around when she wants to play, or cuddle when everyone is sleeping. :)
I had a cat who learned within a minute where the laser pointer was coming from and if you turned it on, he would look at it and promptly walk over and smack it out of your hand.
My cat, Minnie, used to love playing with the laser pointer. Her favorite thing to do was when I would circle it around her and she would spin around and around so fast that she'd lose her balance and fall over. Once she stopped being dizzy, she would run after it.
Oh, I shouldn't use my hands when they're kittens?\n...\n...\n.... I think I just like to suffer.
Always supervise play with a string. A cat can swallow string and injure the intestines as it passes.
Love all of the Cat Logic pieces.  Thanks so much for educating us!!!  Purrrrrrrrrrr
My cat loved crushed up bits of foil.  Used to throw them up the stairs and she would chase the foil ball as it fell and bounced down.  Really enjoyed this video Simon, thanks.
10/10, would invite the vet to dinner
my kitties love the little plastic strip that comes off the dry cat food bag. there's a piece of string that i throw away because, as they do love the string, they tend to try to eat it, and i don't want them to choke on it. but, the little plastic strip is fun for them because it makes a little sound when i wiggle it on the floor, and they can play with it by themselves and have a wonderful time. the only thing is, with more than one cat, they can sometimes 'fight' over it. they also love those little mice that have catnip inside them.  =^..^= *meow*
My cat LOVES empty toilet paper tubes! He shreds them and leaves bits of soggy cardboard pieces for me to pick up later. Also, he loves watching me play find my toys he hides them, STARES AT ME FOR HOURS.... until I get his toys from under the couch or fridge!😸🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾
The laser pointer WAS Hugh's favourite toy?  Did he pass away?
My cat loves to attack my computer screen whatever moves, including this video.\n\nBut, her favorite toy is probably a straw. That's about it. xD

Both my ragdolls love to play with wand/feather toys,  small mice shaped toys and brown packing paper.   With the wand toys they jump really high.
Once,  when  folding  the bed sheets the cats thought it would be  fun to jump on to them while being folded by two persons. Now we have to hide to fold them or else they'll  want to jump onto them. So now we have an old sheet and sometimes we take it out for them to play. They love to jump into it and run all over it and climb it as well. We hold the ends up high as if it was a hammock. They just go crazy.  I wear  thick working gloves cause they turn mad climbing right up to my hands.
My cat Syd is amazing he follows me absolutely everywhere in the house and does the same thing with the laser pointer the button on it rattles  and the second he hears it he goes bananas
Very nice video and wunderful hints. Our cat maja love strings as a toy also. Here is her video. https://youtu.be/_MJkkgRg240

Why do I attract lunatic cats that look absolutely crazy
Ah! My cat loves most play but her favourite is also a piece if string or the laser toy! She reacts just like Hugh! :-) I rattle the key ring & she comes darting out from wherever she has been! If it's not playtime & I'm just trying to move the toy from one place to another I have to pick it up super carefully or the smallest little sound from it has her darting ahead wanting to play! :-D
My cat loved pens! I would just leave them on the bed/floor/chair and he would grab, play with and carry around, the other cat I had love foil sweet wrappers crushed into balls. She was even trained t fetch them.
also please have an indoor-only cat :(
I just like how in the end Nigel just rests on her lap lol
I have the exact same white string.  I can get all the cats to come running if I start dragging it around.
Nigel looks like a cat I know named Airies.
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
What if the cat just isn't interested in play/exercise? Our cat will play for a few minutes sporadically, but usually just looks at us as if to say: Really? What are you doing? He's an indoor Maincoon/Norwegian Forest (very large normally), we have several different style/types of toys, but still just... nothings. Tips/Advice?
Be careful with the laser pointers! Cats have very sensitive eyes! They also can get frustrated because they can't catch something. See here: http://www.einfachtierisch.de/katzen/katzenhaltung/laserpointer-fuer-katzen-gefaehrlich-oder-grosser-spass-id37737/
No need to buy toys for cats. They will play with just about anything.
OMG My Siamese cat LOVES to play with string, but once he swallowed one and puked it back up, so we rarely let him play with string anymore. It was kinda funny though, but he possible could have choked or other bad things could have happened so that was sad.
My cat Popper found a small strip of foam weatherstripping when we were insulating the house for winter. He was obsessed with it..we nicknamed it Mr. Strippy and Popper played with it constantly.  Eventually it got lost, but when we offered him a new one he was not interested.\nAnother cat of ours, Blackbeard, was absolutely terrified of an stuffed catnip mouse we had. One of our other cats managed to rip it open and pull out the catnip and stuffing. Well, once it was no longer stuffed, Blackbeard loved it. He would carrry  Flat Mouse everywhere, even when he was eating or sleeping. One day I was vacuuming and got a little too close to Flat Mouse and sucked him up. Blackbeard sat by the vacuum and cried until I opened the bag and retrieved Flat Mouse.
My baby loved her loose fur. After brushing, she started play with fur and it would become hair ball. I found tens of them under the fridge :-)
*i love cats*\n-I love cats-\nNo dogs\nWait.....\nYou know what?\n*i don't know*
During the winter when my cats can't go outside, Jasmine likes to take a ball with a bell in it, drop it down the basement steps and chase after it. She'll carry it and bring it up stairs again until she's bored.
My cat started having brief seizures from the quick movements of the laser pointer so we no longer use it. Also, always put string away so your kitty won't swallow it.
dear simons cats dad !!  my cats are indoor cats ans have about 40 toys !!   can you tell me why my male cat who has been done  likes to hump me every night on my arm befiore he goes to sleep !!
My cat is weird the fishing rod cat toy my tuxedo Bristol doesn't like the furry end he likes playing with the stick he will actually grab it out of my hand and start wrestling around with it🙄🤔
SIMON...PLEASE PLEASE ...make more of your cats adventures videos...I do like the ones with the vet, but I have rewatched all your oldie goldies...thank you for all your videos
Can you address socialization for cats in the same home? When are they fighting, when are they playing, when are they the same?
Your cat behavioral expert is so hot! Please show her more!
Buster  liked the clear bic pens the made a lot of noise on the wood floor.
I love this cat
I taught my cats no bite and no nails....they either use no nail or bite or do it very gentle. All 5 do this!
keep up the great work
String / shoe lace with the know works well doesn't it?! My cat likes ribbon too.
My 1 year old black cat, Samantha (good name...she's a terror...lol) absolutely loves a yellow stuffed dog toy. She carries it around in her mouth, and when she wants me to play she drops it on top of my foot. Then we play catch the moving toy. She tugs on it like a dog, shakes it like a dog, and fetches it. Then her other favorite toys are marbles! She LOVES to chase marbles (she has about a dozen scattered about) and in the middle of the night I hear her chasing and hitting the marbles. If one goes under a dresser or the fridge, she meows and meows until I get it out for her. we also play the hiding game. When we lock eyes, I quickly hide my eyes between a chair or my bed, and she sneaks up on me to lock eyes w me again. I hide my gaze and she jumps up on the bed to attack me playfully. She is SO much fun!
My cat Loki loved a rolled up piece of foil. Eventually I had to take it away from him because I noticed sparkly poop in the litter box. Oops!
Our ferret's favourite toy was our tabby, Loki.
My 7 month old Zaya loves to play. She likes most toys but she seems to prefer homemade toys. And she loves to play fetch!! My Meeka doesn't play with toys. But they both love the red dot from the laser toy! I have a video on my channel of my kitties and the red dot. ❣ 🐾🐱🐾❣
My cat loves feather toys the only problem is she trys to eat them to much
My cat tickles um well he likes to cuddle with only not anyone else and also he  rarely plays but when he does his rlly cute because hid cheeks give his cuteness away he is part British shorthair
I've spent lots of money on cat toys. Jack always winds up playing with the rubber band off the news paper. He doesn't chew it, he just bats it around until he's worn out or my wife makes me pick it up.
My cat loves one of those plastic poppers, since its like a half ball it moves weirdly. He loves it!
My cat takes litterally anything, string,dust,ANYTHING! Its best. toy. EVER.
I always have played with my cats using my hands to teach them to be gentle with their teeth and claws. I teach them to be gentle by giving them a command as soon as they bite or use their claws and even more better if you can catch it before it happens. Once i know the cat understands the command i slowly stop using the command until it becomes second nature to the cat not to bite down hard or use their claws on humans.Reason why i do this is sometimes even thou you may watch them very carefully around kids, accidents do happen. So i've taught every cat i have owned to be gentle. If you do not introduce them to be gentle with hands, they will not learn how to be gentle when kids or stranger hands touching them.  \n\nAlso i suggest to put away any string or fishing rod toy that dangles in the air or any small toys when you can not watch your cat. Fishing toys can be dangerous too. I had one experience with my cat who love fishing toys. One day i was holding her fishing rod toy it in the air. She jump down from her cat tree running full speed and jump for the fishing toy and the rope accidentally wrapped around her front leg. I am glad when i felt the tug in my hand i let go. I could see her licking her front leg and shoulder blade for couple of minutes and shaking her front leg. I brought her to the vet just in case. Vet said nothing too serious with her leg. Probably just a slight pull but nothing to be concern about. However since that incident she never wants to play with any type of fishing rod toy, she runs away from that toy now.
It was very easy to teach our cats to play with us directly and not damage us. As soon as they use their nails, stop, say ow! with a crying lilt in your voice,  and touch the paw that caused the problem. They learn very quickly. Now our cats even play rake (with their hind legs) our arms using only their pads when we tickle their belly. Same with biting: just stop moving (don't pull away) and say Ow!. Obviously it requires overriding your immediate response as well; pulling away from a claw or bite does more damage (to you) than just freezing. It makes play much more enjoyable for both of us rather than simply using a toy.
My cat is partially blind. Any tips on how to play with a blind cat who has no access to the outdoors?
My cat ate a bee what do I do?!?!
Unfortunately, my cat ignores the string/sock/rolled up paper and thinks my hands are the toy!
I tried to pet a cat once,  got like 10 scratches on my hand in like a sec...... The reason I prefer dogs.
I've stopped buying my cat toys bc she prefers balled up pieces of paper to play catch with. She recognises the sound of me balling up paper and gets ready to play. I love her, she's so playful :)
FUCKEN DOPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
my childhood best frend is back. love
Who'd win  \nthe punisher or Neegan
It'd be awesome if this show does for metal what Luke Cage did for hip hop. This trailer makes me hopeful that it could happen.
There is so many punisher movies and tv shoes can you just stop
Can't wait for this
0:00-0:20 that took a very dark fucking turn
That beginning scene painting the skull on the steel. Such fucking nostalgia as a comic book reader. Can't wait for some mfing Frankie Castle action.
I'd also unleash hell if someone killed my family
THEY NEED TO MAKE A GHOST RIDER SHOW STARING NORMAN REDUS!!!
There is NO BETTER song choice. \nHOLY SHIT I'm shaking.
Metallica makes it sooo much better than it already was
Freaking love the soundtrack \nPerfect actor for the Punisher Role! Thank you Netflix 🤘🏽👍🏽❤️
Hollywood is producing nothing but pure CRAP! 90% of what comes out is a remake or a sequel, esp this marvel bullshit. Same ole, same ole. Get some new scripts and lets see something new and creative. This is boring repetitive nonsense. No wonder these movies aren't making any money.
What  a time to be alive
John Wick vs The Punisher Who would win?
So punisher is finally part of the marvel universe? Yes, ok good!
Metallica for Superbowl 52, it's time now NFL.
Love that Metallica. Instantly recognized One as soon as I heard the drums. Great trailer. The music definitely suits it.
Why is a Jewish mongrel playing the Punisher? How many things are they going to ruin?
Oct 10 is the release date
And then all the middle schoolers went from deadpool to flash to now punisher. Wow thnaks.
Oh my god i want to see this sooooooo bad
I'll give it a like for Metallica
Don't torture me with that release date! lol
That's not the origin story in dare devil\nI think Netflix should have stuck to the script
I wonder if its possible The Russian will be in this. I really fuckin loved The Russian in the first Punisher movie. Also I believe the actor who played The Punisher in that movie cannot be topped but I'll see
I thought his whole family was killed at a family reunion party?
Fuck yes, finally. We get a full violence punisher thst is also written smartly
Looks like Shawn has moved on
I hope Marvel doesn't write for Luke to make Frank check is white privilege. I really don't want Frank to destroy him.
I don't give a shit about Daredevil, hopefully it's not important to watch that first.
Shane what're you doing 😂
So this is what happened to Jon Bernthal's character after he finished the heist in Baby Driver. Dies, returns back home, watches his family die, and goes on a killing spree. Look, even the music times up to the gunshots.
I sent that Shane from the walking dead imao
Saw online today, that something got leaked in a magazine saying Oct14. Don't know if it's true or not.
Hope he gets his hands on some Judas bullets.
Holy shit I can't wait
conversations between karen and frank will be sooooo fucking annoying again, and because of frank...
This is the greatest trailer ever made.
I'm hoping they finally get it right.
if john wick and Rambo had a baby it'd be punisher.
metalica`s one song its just perfect for the punisher story
Punisher and Justice League in the space of a month, what more can u ask for!
Can we have an entire clip of this music with the punisher, PLEASE?
Netflix's THE PUNISHER will be released 8#)-*+')#:9)# of 2017.
“I want to Kill em All”
I recognised him playing One instantly
please dont be shit like iron fist/luke cage/defenders.
The release date we got a glimpse was ??-?2-17. February is way gone. This can only mean it'll be released in december 2017.
When it started with One I was like awwwwww yusssss such a good song for him ....but then.... it was like an eye and ear gasm....can't wait finally a punisher that follows expectations!
This is Cool!!! but I hate the Costume... it's like the Punisher's tight shirt becomes XXL !!!
On his John Wick shit I see!
But the whole reason he Punishes, is because his family murdered by gangsters...Not a government conspiracy.
Basically the plot of Gladiator, looks good though
Such mixed bag of emotions. Is this boner normal?
I hope shane has improved his acting skills, he was terribad in the walking dead
I've watched this trailer at least 20 times in the last week
Can't wait to see Netflix's version of Jigsaw. >:)
damn i already saw this trailer too many times.
Hopefully not terrible like Iron Fist, Luke Cage and Defenders.
Finally a good Marvel show that isn't all don't kill the bad guy in self-defense or you're worse than he is
boiiiiiiiiiiiii
now i gotta try and renender ny netflix password
GEEKED!! 💪🏽💪🏽🔥🔥
cia= stooges of the pederasty fiends
Nice!!!
Cool!!
Look dumb
That fucking scream at 1:51 my gawd
Name of song??
Netflix only fuck that noise
This better not suck
ALL.I.SEE.IS.SHANE😭 #twd
OH FUCK YEA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
FINALLY!!! THE PUNISHER WE DESERVE!!!
Will Spider-Man be featured ???
Its about time netflix!!!
dang looks good netflix has been pumping out good marvel stuff
Shane looks so fucked up
one word EPIC!
My Pleasure...💀
Time to rewatch daredevil
So cool
not even serious face, shity acting
Punisher Metallica's one sold. ''Shut up and take my money!!!''
Ah, The Punisher... if only there were guys like him in real life.
Did anybody notice Karen Page @ 1:20, I guess it’s supposed to be the the house shooting scene from Daredevil. Anyone agree with me?
Who ever threw the music to the trailer deserves a raise. Perfection.
If your wondering what song that was, it was One by MetallicA.
holy FUCK THIS LOOKS AMAZING
PESADO
WHO EDITED THIS??
the song works soooooo welll rock on punisher + metallica so fuckin wildly awesome
I just grew like 10 chest hairs.
garbage old versions better, \nwho with me
Weak af
Easy way to beat the punisher is to find out where he lives, sneak up on him and shoot him. One of the easiest superhero to kill.
the only punisher is thomas jane...
Bop after bop, you guys are saving music this year <3
This is such a bop
Watching you guys improve with every video is phenomenal. Keep doing what you do
Love this song!! Absolutely love the video
they did it again! 😍
Not even joking today i was in music and my teacher played Pentotonix for our stretches and I was like SUPERFRUIT!!!!!!!!YASSSSSSSSSS!!!!!! My teacher asked me who is Superfruit and I said the best Youtubers EVER!!!!!!!!
WHY IS SCOTT TALKING TO GIRLS? IS THERE STILL HOPE?!?
This is my new anthem on Tinder because guys don't fucking reply
1:18 if you want to skip the start
I SCREAMED SO LOUD AT THE END
*Scott and Mitch almost kiss*\nMitch: I can't\nMe: *hyperventilates* Neither can I Mitch. NEITHER CAN I.
Amazing music and video!\nA brasilian  here who loves Superfruit! I listen to your music every day!
The bartender, at the end, is all of us. 😂
This song is literally me
This song means so much to me. I cried. My favorite so far. Thank you Scott. Thank you Mitch.
uhggggg I can fucking relate and I wish I couldn't
Ooh Mitch into the darkskins..... I see you.
Are the table cards on the reception desk an Easter egg? Any significance to 6-2-15?
I love the whole album but Part Two is my favorite! Hurry Up is my number 1! What's your favorite song everyone?
y'all got janet from the Good Place? nice

i just can't I LOVE THE BEGINING SO MUCH
That face at 2:47 is me on a daily basis
That's my JAM! So good! So true! In love!
I love u mitch
The actors/dancers in the beginning scene at the tables were really really great they were cast well and loooksd so natural doing the transition.. the best part of the song was the bridge therest of the song was flat and boring I was expecting it to be more dynamic
Wait is Scott bi??? Lmao what's happening
Ahhh, the anticipation of that kiss between Scott and Mitch has been building for years. Why?!
Sorry but i can't unhear cum on me :'v
WHY IS MITCH LITERALLY ME IN THIS VIDEO
Need a choreo video for this!!
She cant help it, shes an android
I live for the awkward scene at the beginning where that chick is totally feeling up Scott but barely paying attention to Mitch. Acting skills on point in this one!
isnt this the girl from from good place\n\nwas it Janet?
I hate the ending 😂😂
Who can agree that Mitch and Scott and perfect for each other..
it's so fun to watch you guys, your songs are the best, keep doing this amazing job!!😍
I'm that barman at the end
Mitch was so ready to get Blacked...
This is so cute thank u scott and mitch ily
WHO'S THIS F*CKING HOT DANCER????!!!!!
I keep watching this waiting for the end to change by itself who else
Y'all are firing out new videos like a machine gun and im LOVING IT
Holly crap! He sounds like a GIRL !!! HE IS SO CUTEEE THO! ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
Mitch: *laughs* I can't.\n\nMe: Y? You've done it like twice already (on camera).
YES ADORABLE LITTLE BEANS DO YA THANG! Incredible like always! I knew the ending was coming but I mean ahhhh........ Their next video better be their engagement video I swear to god.
That was SO GOOD. I did not expect it to be THAT good. \nThese people are freaking amazing...I'm done.
I just can't stop dancing!! Their music makes me so happy.Diversity is the best.
In Algebra II \nOne foot in ... oh I understand this for once.\n\nOne foot out ... What just happened, what is that.\n\nOne more minute from shutting down... I need to go to the bathroom, because I don't feel like having a mental break down in the middle of class.
OH MY GOSH
I ❤️ scotch 💋
My little girls and I are OBSESSED with your new stuff and I LOVE that all body types, ethnicities, fabulous people are represented in your videos. I truly believe that your music/message transcends all labels and is empowering for everyone - especially kids who are just starting to figure out who they are. <3
I swear to fucking God in the heavens above... GET MARRIED!!!!! Y’all are the definition of relationship goals and I look up to you so much as a gay person but y’all make another one of these teasers I will die.

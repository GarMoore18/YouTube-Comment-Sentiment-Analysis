Naprawdę dobry film. Jeszcze lepszy silnik, oświetlenie wygląda imponująco, a system kamer mógłby być nawet niezgorszy
Mam działające VooDoo i 3Dfx :P gdzieś jest zakopane w piwnicy razem z celeronem na Slot1
Wow Real 3d na Amidze :D He he chłopaki a pamiętacie korekcję perspektywiczną tekstury na kwadracie złożonym z 2 trójkątów, czy już za Was to robiła biblioteka 3d. :D
Możne na tej podstawie zrobi ktoś remake
Co to są prywatnych archiw? Kto dodał ten opis, autor wywiadu?
Jestem w szoku. Tak wyglądająca gra w  tamtym roku, jakby do tego dodać super fabułę to odniosłaby myśle, że duży sukces. Pozdrawiam i szanuję. :D
Na moich oczach tworzy się piękna Historia, dziękuję Panowie!
Ktoś powinien dokończyć ten projekt i wydać.
Jakby co jestem w stanie sklecić fizyczny sprzęt z VooDoo na pokładzie :)
Żeby takie cudo przetrwało jeszcze długo to proponowałbym dodać kody na jakąś stronkę gdzie wszyscy mogliby nacieszyć oko jak została zbudowana ta gra :D (jakiś Github czy coś w tym stylu.).
arhn.eu - teraz tylko znajdźcie działającego Polybiusa i możemy zamykać
Archon pewnie pod dupą trzymał to demo tak jak dodatek do Gothica
Pamiętam, że szkice do tej gry były dla mnie impulsem do zapisania się na Wiedźmińską listę dyskusyjną. Ktoś jeszcze pamięta co to były listy dyskusyjne?
To jest odpalane pod eulatorem 3dfx na Amidze?
Nieco mi ten Wiedźmin przypomina Dark Earth z 1997
MOŻE MOŻNA KUPIĆ AKCELERATOR VOODOO NA ALLEGRO \nAkcelerator DIAMOND MONSTER 3D 4MB (3dfx VooDoo) CENA NA ALLEGRO PL 24,00 zł
Pełen szacunek za odkopnie dema, a także zaproszenie świetnych gości. Jestem pod wrażeniem :-)
Czy ja dobrze widzę, że modele 3D były robione na Amidze w Real3D ?
Łohoohooo! Arhn, Archonie i wszyscy, którzy przyczyniliście się do odnalezienia i powstania tego materiału - chwała Wam za dokonane odkrycia. Świetny materiał. Tego dłuższego nie miałem jeszcze, niestety, czasu obejrzeć w całości, ale już wkrótce dokończę. Brawa!
To się pojawiło w okolicach pierwszego wiedźmina.
To uczucie kiedy grasz w Wiedźmina III na najmniejszych ustawieniach graficznych
Przydało by się solidne wyjaśnienie jaką rolę w tym co właśnie widzieliśmy odegrała Amiga. Co to za emulatory, które dzisiaj pozwalają uruchamiać te odnalezione materiały produkcyjne?
Takie materiały (mimo, że opierają się jedynie na rozmowie), mógłbym oglądać godzinami :) Poproszę więcej, chociażby na drugim kanale arhn.eu!
Wieki szacunek za ten materiał =D
Masz najlepsze wywiady ever! propsy
mega materiał! oby więcej takich
Odkąd w jednym z komentarzy pod dokumentem na temat pierwszego Wiedźmina pojawiła się informacja, że istnieje grywalna wersja tego legendarnego Wiedźmina od studia Metropolis, a na dodatek jest jeszcze z niego film na YT, czekałem na ten materiał. :D Dzięki za wywiad, świetna sprawa i idealnie dopełnia opublikowany niedawno film dokumentalny. :)
Jest może szansa na opublikowanie scenariusza? Bardzo mnie ciekawi jak ówczesny zespół zapatrywał się na fabułę  :)
Hej. Zdaję  mi się że w 10:21 Pan Jarek nie mówi przeżuło a przeżyło (lekki błąd w napisach). Taka drobna dygresja :)
A dlaczego projekty powstawały na Amidze? :)
Jestem światkiem growej ARHeologii ! Brawo ! Zupełnie się nie spodziewałem, że kiedykolwiek zobaczę jak wyglądał pierwszy Wiedźmin. Niesamowite znalezisko.
Chmielarz,żeby się teraz nie spocił od tego sapania..
Baaardzo fajny follow up po filmie o historii W1. Gratulacje dla Arhn.eu i dla twórców z tamtych czasów.
nie no, za dużo wiedźminów teraz XD juz nie wiem jaki demo technologiczne oglądam , czekam na film pt. odnaleziony brudnopis Sapkowskiego ze szkicem swiata wiedzmina
ZMIAŻDŻYLIŚCIE! Rozwialiście wszelkie wątpliwości. Żaden Damian Zielarz ain't got shit on you!
Dzięki że tego nie skasowaliście panowie. Archon świetna robota. Pozdrawiam
Szkoda, że nie ma nigdzie tych kodów w sieci.
Z wielką przyjemnością zobaczyłbym kod źródłowy!!. ARHN co materiał to podbijacie poprzeczkę jakości. Super ;) Mega materiał! Pozdrawiam!
Będzie ono może udostępnione w necie?
Jak na tamte czasy to i tak świetnie wyszło
Jeszcze chwila i przyjdzie pora na rozszerzoną edycję dokumentu o wiedźminie
Od zawsze go chciałem zobaczyć XD
Archon jesteś mistrz nad mistrze- wychowałem się na grach w latach 90 tych, dziś choć nie mam już czasu i weny żeby nocą,i przechodzić tytuły znalazłem przystać w postaci Twojego kanału, która czyni ze gry dalej są dla mnie ważną rzeczą- ukłon i szacunek!
Kurcze, oni mają gierkę, ale nie mają sprzętu z tamtych lat, żeby ją odpalić na pełnoprawnym Voodoo, ja za to mam sporo takiego sprzętu, m. in. akcelerator Voodoo 1  oraz kartę graficzną Voodoo Banshee. Ciekawe czy daleko ode mnie mieszkają.
Hej. Uwielbiam Cie słuchać masz rewelacyjny głos i płynnie się wysławiasz.\nCiekawe materiały ze świata gier i konsol, naprawdę cieszy mnie, że mój znajomy mi Cie  polecił. Pozdrawiam
Wygląda fajnie to mogła być naprawdę fajna gra
Archonie kiedy Time Warp: PlayStation 3?
Ladne ta gra wyglonda ale 20 lat temu na tostesze z kartom vodo ps. Dacie link do dema bo chcialem sprawdzic czy dziala na prawdiwym pc
OPUBLIKUJECIE TO DEMO?!
Jarek ma bródkę na Arka, chyba zapalony widz arhn.eu :D
Pietrek kogucik <3
Dobrze, że to wtedy nie wyszło. Jakby to miało wyjść zamiast znanej nam jedynki to by był koszmar XD
czy możecie udostępnić exe tego dema abyśmy mogli doświatczyć tego dema technologicznego
Ale z was archeolodzy. Wczoraj Gothic Sequel, dziś demo Wiedźmina, jutro odnalezienie Half-Life 3, a pojutrze Archon odkryje sens życia! Czapki z głow Panowie
Czyli Chmielarz miał rację a tak się kłóciłeś z nim :) Kamera jest 3D! Fajnie że to się odkopało.
Dzięki bogu to gówno nigdy nie ujrzało światła dziennego...
Dlaczego prowadzący mówi w tak dziwny sposób?
Ci goście to prawdziwe legendy polskiego gaming'u 👍
Czy tylko ja widzę tu Gothic 1 :D
Loved your personality and humour in this vlog !! Was so enjoyable to watch. \nNot saying that you're not always like this I just noticed haha
I love you Nile but OMG KOHEI THE GOD
Enjoy Canada Nile!
Where can I watch the championchips in Internet?
The  gymnast who is in Nile's vlogs that fell into the judges was in this video at the end. Haha\nThe Most Awkward Moments in Sports On Live Tv | Funny TV Bloppers
My 12th birthday was 10 days ago
Such a nice lad I mean really nice, genuine, warm, funny and caring. I wish Nile and the team all the luck in the world
I saw you on Sunday (because I'm a volunteer) but I want to actually meet you so bad!! I hope I'll get the opportunity! Love you xx
I'm from Trinidad and didn't know we have a gymnastic team until seeing this video. #GoTNT
Hey Nile! My father is a competative golf pro and is constantly talking about the importance of hydration (for obvious reasons lol). Could you tell me a bit about the machine you guys use to check your hydration levels, as well as the tablets you take to help (how do they work)? I think he would be very interested! Thanks, and as always love the videos!
you're staying right across the street from where i used to live omfg
Thank you for the playlists :D
Im so excited for the world championship! Hope to see you preform when i come!
Do the girls gymnastics while wearing a girls leotard
Cool vlog!
Why aren't you verified yet?
Crazy the amount of supports the GB gymnastics team have a competition!! I figure skate and we will have a team leader just to make sure there's no problems, none of this hydration tests in the morning with physio and immune booster packs!! It's awesome to see what funding and proper management does 😅
What tablet do you put in your water?
2:51 was THE BEST!!!! Uchi, you vlog mate? I LOVE IT!!!!
Nile u were staying in the same room I did in Montreal
great i have been in a plane once in my life
Hey I’m an American medical student from SXM and I’m now living in Preston,UK. Good luck at worlds and maybe run into you on the streets! Cheers!
Looking fit Nile mate, best of luck!
You are Amazing you have inspired my in gymnastics to never give up and dream what you beleive 😁😁
Welcome to Canada! I love Montreal! Ahaha ha showing off our Canadian Monopoly money!
Lol Imagine if they found out!\nBTW Don't Read My Name
I'm in Montreal for the championships. I wish I could meet you
OMG you are to Montreal 😍
Good to see u buddy.  I missed you.  Man, you are amped up.  Were you drinking Red Bull.  Best of luck at the competition.👍👍
Please show us a competition, a majority of TV channels will not show. At least in Brazil they will only show the finals and in closed channels (paid)... Nile, continue your incredible work, I'm supporting you here
So exciting!  Can't wait to see you Monday!
Damn I love when you dance man
I want to fly and handstand with you...
How's Montreal? \nDid you learn some french words?
This was actually a quite entertaining and well produced vlog. Great job
Your personality is awesome❤I hope I can get to meet you one day and get to talk with you! I have a GREAT IDEA to tell you, my twitter is @peque2111 in case you want to contact me!
Nile Wilson is such a great, beautiful, and inspirational human being ever!
I knew you'd vlog, been so excited for it ;)
I want to learn Japanese just so I can have a conversation with kohei and kenzo
Welcome to my home town. Hope you're having a great time.
Handstand on a plane. How do you top that? Love the comradery!! 😘
Need a T shirt bad, in white...help help I've injured my back but don't give a fuck..yes I'm very limited at the mo but ..the back support I use is very helpful
Holy yeaaaaaaaaah, I'm coming to see you guys on the 8th! I'm so excited! Get that podium Nile!
I'm going to upload my own video 'Taking a shit at 40,000 feet' :)
Gymnasts are the best, cutest, funniest, most athletic, and beautiful people in the world.\nNile's videos just bring joy, and brighten your day!  That's why everyone loves him!
Shirai is freaking monster on the floor! :O
I wish I could meet a world champion gymnast...... (nile Wilson)
Good luck for World Championships Nile. Love your channel and your positivity.
Oooooo did a hand stand on a air plane What a bad ass lol YouTube is broken XD
When you get home do a gymnastics challenge with the women where you guys try eachother's apparatuses!!!!
Do a meet up in montreal !!!!!
ah i love the japs, uchimura, what a boy. love that you guys are still friendly with your competitors even in sport where you could potentially isolate yourself from the world and just train individually.
The gravity gets weaker as you move further away from the earth's core. So you're effectively cheating. And people liking your cheating video.
omg I live in Montreal!! I wanted to come see you perform but I can't because of school... would have loved to meet you though!
good luck!! hope you absolutely smash the comp!
Omggggg MONTREAL?!!?? How did I not knowww?!??? I live in mtl!!
I'm from Montreal! It would be so cool to meet you.But I can't come to the championships because of school🙁
To Montreal.......nice.  I wanna move to Canada lol.....if Mexico didn't have the cartels I'd move there and live like a king on American dollar.  Same thing....if Macedonia wasn't so expensive to fly to and on the verge of Civil wars and shit all the time I'd go live there for a Summer like a king because I still got relatives there.  Good luck with the world championships dude!  Hope u smash it!
It might sound weird but you're my idol!
You know if anyone In space does a frontflip or turn upside down. You would be beatin
I'm so happy that you're in my city right now! I hope you enjoy your stay! :D
Kohei and Kenzo in the thumbnail would have been pretty solid clickbait as well haha, love the comraderie and sportsmanship in MAG :)
I’ll be at the tournament in Montreal I’ll look for u!!
I live in Trinidad
Great video!  Good luck!
More dancing please!!!!!!!!!
I saw Kohei and fell
世界選手権楽しみにしています！！\nかんばってください

I SAW NILE TODAYYYYY
Kohei and Kenzo!!! <3
Brilliant idea with the Spotify playlists!
This was a SWEEEET vlog lad but you know what I want? Ima need more of that UCHI footage!!!!
Hey Nile, when do you find out if you are in the com games team? or are you already in it?
hi Nile! I'm so sad, I wanted to come and watch the world championchips but I injured myself and I have to get surgery... I broke my right knee and 3 ligaments and my leg at a trampoline park, I'm gonna keep a cast on my whole leg until january... I'm so sad I can't do gymnatics this year, only conditioning, it sucks... I love you so much thank you for sharing your Journey with us!
What kind of English do you speak man I can barely get you!!
Well done  Nile on making the squad good luck in the world championships. My daughter is recovering from a fractured elbow from a fall off the beam. She has been following you since you visited her gym for their 1st aniversary and you have inspired her to keep going thankyou xx
What kind of gimnastics you are training?cuz i really wanna start gimnastics the kind of u
Why did you take off your shirt to do a handstand?
where to buy these headphones? :D
Who is this guy ?
what is the Bane Mask that you wear when you are warming up sometimes?
Are the world championships shown on TV??
You're a cool guy, Nile. But you're not going to defeat Epke Zzonderland.
can you do a video on how you introduced darcey to liam?
Almost 17 and definitely grew out of the cuddly stage a year or two after primary school,  I have no idea why i just feel super gross being so affectionate (not that I’m not still loving to my parents though!) so make the most of it!
💖💕💖😘I hope she stays cuddly and affectionate too. As an almost 20 year old I still squeeze into my mums lap for cuddles 😂I get nicknamed leech because of how much affection I crave 😂💖😘💕you're a wonderful mum and Darcy will continue to grow up to be beautiful and kind like you & I'm sure she'll be an amazing role model for baby sister.
You might regret joining the PTA!! (the struggle is real at times!) 😂
Don't worry, Louise- I'm 19 and I still love hugging my mom!
That conker story is absolutely GOLD.
My Mum got pregnant with my little brother when I was 3 and a half and one of my earliest memories is trying to put a fish finger into her belly button 'to feed the baby'!!!!! Lovely video Louise Xxx
I love hearing about Darcy, the way you talk about her makes me think of my own mother who passed away a couple of years ago. I hope that's not weird to say! But it's just so lovely to hear that pride and warmth and affection in your voice and now that I'm an adult it's nice to see that perspective on a mother and daughter relationship more from the angle of a mum, and to maybe get a closer view into how my own mother felt watching my sister and I grow up. Anyway, Darcy is so charming, and I love her sense of humour! You've raised a remarkable little person, Louise!
Louise, you are an incredibly and amazingly good mum. So inspiring.
i can feel the dnp collab coming!\n\ndarcy is such a lovely little girl! i'm very happy for you and your family and i wish you guys all the best.
When my little sister was 6 she loved swimming and was so good at it
I am wearing a face mask so can't move my face so i had to try and stop hysterically laughing when louise said that darcy had called the conker jesus😂😂
I remember when darcy was 4! X
My little sister is 9 and still does the cuddly I love you thing 😊 she will come into my room in the morning and give me cuddles before she goes to school ❤️
My 6 year old little sister does a lot of similar things, 6 year olds are all little weirdos but it makes them so funny ahahah. Love you and Darcy, Louise! Xx
this made me so happy aww
You look glowing Louise! What a sweet little girl Darcy sounds like, she clearly has grown up with a loving and beautiful mum!
The way you talk about Darcy makes my heart melt 😍 also, you look so glowing Louise!
I was 2 when my sister was born and apparently ( I can't remember ) I was excited but then when she came I threw a jumbo lego brick at her luckily 2 year olds have bad aim .  love you Louise ❤️
I was 6 1/2 when my brother was born, and I think it's a great age for that because I actually have memories of him being born, whereas I was 3 when my sister was born and I don't really have memories of that. Darcy is going to be the best big sister! And when you were talking about not wanting her to grow up, all I could think of is Bev from The Goldbergs.
I very much hope that your priest responded quickly along the lines of see the conkering hero comes! lol - all of that anecdote made us laugh, so sweet x
im glad to hear shes learning to swim! its such an important skill and im so grateful my mom made me take lessons even when i didnt want to.
Don't worry Louise I'm almost 18 and I still have daily cuddles with my mom xx
having her less on camera makes sense, and it makes the moments she is on camera all the more precious :)
Darcy is simply the most adorable little munchkin! What a lucky wee girl to have such a doting mum, too! You are just *oozing* joy at the moment Louise. I can see how proud of your family you are and just how content life is for you at the moment. I'm so happy you're happy!
It's so warming to hear about your affection for each other😊 she such a sweet little girl💛when I was 6 I also liked to play role play, mainly as a vet with my stuffed animals, now I'm volunteering at my local vets for real!!💛
Ironic how u wash her hair when you dont wash your own
greatest thing since wifi  😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 as a mum I can relate 💖💖💖💖
This conkers for you vicar and I've named it jesus
Louise oh my gosh I cannot even BEGIN to tell you how much I appreciate you taking so much care into preparing Darcy for the new baby :') Every time you talk about it I'm reminded of the godawful job my mom and stepdad did for me when my mom was pregnant and I'm just really happy for Darcy that she has such a great mom like you * crying emoji *
My niece is 6 next month and is a gorgeous little weirdo too. I swear we weren't as quirky as kids today. I sound so old lol.
I'm 21 and haven't grown out of loving having hugs with my momma and never ending saying I love you to my momma she's my best friend. Darcy sounds like such an amazing little girl who has such a great personality and is such a mini you ❤️
I am currently 16 years old, and my mother is like secretly FREAKING OUT and everytime I mention moving out when I'm 18 or going to university she just avoids the topic, or tells me how I'd probably be more comfortable at home where she can cook for me and do my laundry while I'm busy studying...\nBless her <3
What I remember watching your pregnancy announcement and it feels like only yesterday! She's so amazing and I'm praying for a smooth pregnancy for yous. \nAlso try keep darcy in swimming and maybe get her on your local team, I'm a swimmer and it is such a nice lil community and swimming is so amazing❣
My daughter is 6 and a half too. I've been following you and Darcy for years ;) My daughter Matilda is obsessed with card making and making me little letters and 'story books' I absolutely love this age :)
I love that you and Darcy are so close, I never grew out of the cuddly stage. I would always cuddle my mum and sit on her lap for a hug until I was 15 when she passed ❤
I'm pretty sure the best thing since sliced bread came from the wonder loaf the first packaged slice bread in America I think before that there was obviously only loafs that you had to cut and I guess got laborious and it would dry out etc so imagine packaged bread that you don't need to hack at ... sorry probably WAY too much information lol 😂
I'm so happy Darcy is all good and happy :)xx
I want a video of Dan, Phil, and Louise playing with Darcy (: please please please
I'm sure she will love having a little sister xx
I'm so happy for you Louis! Your a great mum!😁💖
Madam president has a nice ring to it, alright madam president.
We all love Darcy so much❤️❤️❤️
I have a feeling Darcy will be a great sister because as you said during the video she loves playing with dollies and things so she'll probably be her little sisters mummy and probably be a waiter to her little sister.
I'm 15 and me and my mum still have bedtime cuddles and lots of cuddles and I love you's! She's still my best friend x
Your love for Darcy is simply beautiful! You share the best relationship xoxo Love you both so much!
you look so good in this video Louise!!!
Hi Louise, loved this video it's so nice to hear how Darcy is doing I'm glad she's growing up so well❤️ just wondering how do you and Liam go about disciplining her? Like do you let Liam tell her off to?
Darcy is the sweetest little girl x
So lovely seeing another girl who shares my name! (even with a different spelling) \n\nI've only ever met dogs called Darcey haha
Go you for being president of the PTA.  I've never joined.  Apparently it's a political minefield 😱
I've named it Jesus 😂😂😂😂😂
Louise you are such a great mom! Great video 💞
I genuinely think I washed my own hair from about the age of 4...but then I was really into swimming from very young so I used to wash my own hair in the pool showers. Don't really remember hair washing with my mum...although I'm sure she did at some point 😂
This is so cute. The squirrel stickers on the car made me chuckle xxx
Madame President 😂😂 god I love you haha
I was six when my sister was born, she is my best friend ever since. Hope Darcy and the little one go on <3
I understand Mickey Mouse Clubhouse & PJ Masks, I feel like I can quote every episode word for word with my siblings! 😂
Our daughters have the same age and we are due almost the same time :-)! Darcy is such a sweetie! Also my daughter is still all huggy and sweet and I hope so much that this will never change!
My daughter is 6 &1/2 halos and she is so similar to Darcy. I get a letter almost every day and hugs and kisses and I love yous and she likes to negotiate dinner a lot. My daughter likes to have private talks away from her brother about school and her friendships and it makes me so happy and I just know that God-willing we will be best friends. 🤗🤗🤗
OMG now i want to have a six year old this made me so excited and happy and 😍
im 15 and am still the biggest cuddle ever i love it and my mum is too! xx
I'm 19 and I'm still super cuddly with my mum because we're very close so I wouldn't worry, Darcy could definitely hold on to that trait x
I'm almost 22 and I still live with my mom, we still cuddle every day so don't worry, she will probably do that when she's older \n\nYou look absolutely lovely Louise xx
The Jesus conker story made me howl with laughter!  I teach children Darcy's age and they are just FULL of random little comments like that!
PJ MAKS ARE ON OUR WAY INTO THE NIGHT TO SAVE THE DAY, this sound is in my head far too much
My little sister was born on Christmas Eve, and it took me months to open my Christmas presents because I was more interested in the baby! 😂😁
My cousin is 4 and wants to be a stripper. Like, I know I said you can be anything but you have to draw the line somewhere.
This video was so wholesome and wonderful! I'm happy to hear that she's doing well and all the quirky things that she does. She sounds like such a wonderful little person, just like her mum
When is the dan and Phil video coming out
When my mum had me she bought my older sister a plastic doll. When mum fed me, bathed me, changed my nappy, put me to sleep etc, My sister would do the same for the doll. I think that would work really well for Darcy if she likes role playing and it keeps her involved in the whole process. Kept my sister from feeling ignored because of new bub. \n\nReally enjoyed this video! She's growing up into such a beautiful little girl!
I have a brother that has just turned 7 so ovs he was six before and he likes having hair washes more as well xxxx
So nice to hear about the cuddles part. I was and STILL AM suuuuuper cuddly with my mum. I love love love cuddles and saying I love you etc
I've just realised there's the same age gap between Darcy and the baby as there is between me and my sister. It's really the best. I'm sure they'll get on so well and Darcy will teach her new little sister so much 😊
Louise you are #8 on trending!!💗
so exited to hear Darcy I getting a little sister!!!! but can you show us Liam in a video!?
Is Louise engaged again or just dating at the moment also with who ❤️❤️
My daughter is exactly the same age as Darcy and very similar. She also loves to write us little notes and is a big cuddler. She's definitely a negotiator as well, and enjoys pretend play more than anything! Hair washing became easier for us after we started letting her dye her hair (temporary, very safe dyes, no bleach or anything), because I have to fuss with it so much to dye it.\n\nLove hearing about Darcy! She is absolutely precious :).
'I named it Jesus' hahahahahaha
Darcy is gorgeous!
Love this so  muchglad shes going great
❤️❤️❤️
I love ur hair colour!
Darcys six😱😱😱😱😱
Ahhhhh...       Mr Darcy.
Great video
awww so sweet xxx
Louise is a PTA mum aka goals
WTF HOW IS DARCY 6
Darcys 6?!! god they grow so much😫😍💕
OMG pj mask.
Squirrel car sounds iconic honestly
Jesus conker 😂
PJ Masks 😂
Louise you are glowing!!
Louise ur skin is glowing u look gorgeous ❤️👍🏽👌🏽
lovely video madam president 😂
Can you do what's in my baby's registry
What happened to Zulu?
I'm so happy you're PTA president!!! What a special thing to be able to do for Darcy. My mom was president when my sisters and young and I have so many great memories of her being at school for parties and being so proud of her when she spoke at meetings! You rock
She's a bit too small for the chair since she can't sit yet... maybe wait a bit :)
can all of the online doctors shut the fuck up ? it's their child they know what to do. they wouldn't do anything to hurt their baby.
That's how I feel when I eat mushy carrots.  Eweee!
Has the video quality gone up
I think Alessia looks just like Eduardo!! Can't believe how fast she has grown!! Her lil face bless her! Her smile just melts my heart! So precious x
Augh!  Soooooo CUTE!
Alessia is growing up too quickly! 💕💕
It was even cooler if u guys did a theme for the calendar for next year
Hi Anna, what is that book you are using?? I am just curious as my 19 week old has just started weaning (been told she is fine to by her health visitor) and has just started on porridge at breakfast time. As i am a first time mum i don't really know much about weaning or where to start and how to keep introducing new foods any tips would be very appreciated. :) Hope you are well. Love to you all <3<3<3<3<3
I wouldn’t listen to bestie in front of the kids the word are quite yano😂x
Kids do grow up so fast! My son just turned one. Looking through his pictures makes me emotional and happy at the same time.
What is alessia thinking when she's humming and waving in the high chair? Because she's not crying but she's not smiling. Not judging or anything I'm just genuinely interested to know if there are any baby experts!
omg!! i want the calendar😍😍
I have the 2016&2017 calendars but I don’t use calendars any more :(
@20:46 she looks like your dad Anna.........
does anyone know the song that starts at 0:43 ?
Hey, what is the song that was in the video?
Ordered the calendar yesterday.  My third one!    💗
A lovely video I really enjoyed watching it :):) :):) emilia, Eduardo and alessia are so cute emilia was so adorable when she said  a pearl necklace 😀🐶❤️ Eduardo was so sweet when he gave Anna a hug and alessia looked so cute when she was smiling at the camera :):) :):) \n\nAlessia is getting big now Aww that was so cute seeing alessia trying food for the first time x
I live in China and how to get the calendar?
I ordered the calendar can’t wait until I get it except I’m not allowed have it until Christmas 😭so excited looks amazing xxxxx
I love ya'll! You make my heart happy! Such a blessing
That last bit got me all emosh!
I thought they would've started earlier on the baby food. She starting to look chubby.  👍👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️
HOW IS ALESSIA EATING PROPER FOOD. I CAN'T. I remember when she was born and waiting to see pics and it felt like ages an now she's nearly 6 months!!! omg emotional. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
My how times have changed! When my children were babies, the first food introduced to them was  rice cereal mixed very watery with their formula so they could just sort of slurp it down ! Mind you my first child is now 47 years old so that was many many years ago and so many things have changed!
Got it last year and advent but as much as I adore this family funds don’t allow to get this year and poster plus packaging take to nearly 20 so I will just keep the Callander I have as a momento
My niece has that pink Disney Minnie Mouse, she wore it for her 1st birthday ❤❤
Holy crap, I teared up at the end.
Guys, episode guide website doesn't work(
I have never bought a calendar before because I was waiting for the one where Alessia makes her calendar debut and yesterday I bought it 👍👏
I want to be woken like Eduardo 😜
do you guys ship to india ? the calendar ?
I remember being told to mix my breastmilk with the baby food when I started feeding Mari solids
She's so little, she doesn't look 6months 😍
My neice is 6months and i saw her eat solids 4 the first time it was so cute and she kept smiling and trying to laugh xx i love her so much
Vomit material. This is the modern world. The abyss is staring at it, staring, and no-ones looking back.
Her face every time you put the spoon in her mouth 😂 bless her
You make my day I was going to see the NHS doctor today changed my mined I just wanted to match you guys love you xxx 😘
It’s not time to chill lol
I’m 27 and I  make the same faces as Alessia when someone forced veggies on me.
Awww her what are you even feeding me face is so funny. Bless her. She's adorable. Hope the next taste/texture of food goes down better with her x
What a beautiful video!!!
You should make a little video of the three of them trying food for the first time! That ending was too sweet by the way!
We're gonna be here for all of Alessia's first and I can't handle the excitment.
Everyone is saying isn't it weird yo have a calendar from an other family. Well I'm sure you have a calendar from idk Shawn Mendes but that's not weird????? Hypocrits.
This is so special! \nVery cute. 💋\nGreetz from Holland
It's insane to me how even though you're only seeing literally less than 5% of someone's day, there are actually people out there who don't comprehend that what you see isn't the whole picture. And these people seem to always be know-it-all's in the comments telling the SacconeJoly's how they are living their lives all wrong because of course, the know-it-all's obviously know everything as well as the amount of people who literally CHOOSE to watch these vlogs, yet consistently make the most asinine and terribly rude comments with the sole goal of tearing this family down. It's honestly so pathetic how people can act so outrageously if they're behind a keyboard where they're 'safe,' yet wouldn't dare to speak the way they do out loud in the 'real world.' \n\nJesus Christ people, let the SacconeJoly's freaking breathe. Let them live rather than criticizing every chance you get. How you treat others says a LOT about your character and who you truly are as a person. Do you feel fulfilled as a human being by always trying to bring someone else down? Ask yourself that and be honest. \n\nAnna and Jonathan, keep on keeping on. Turn a blind eye to those who don't bring anything good to you. Thanks for being my daily getaway from my personal troubles and stress and always bringing me 20 minutes of happiness when I need it most. You have made my life a bit better than it was before I first found you on YouTube. I am forever thankful for that. Keep making your dreams come true! \nGodspeed. ✌🏼❤️
Alessia's little hands are so cute 😂😂😍😍
Do they still have their workouts?
I'm glad you uploaded this. Im a first time mum and my baby is about 2 weeks older than yours. I'm weaning him at the moment. And he makes those faces when I give his food. I thought I was doing something wrong lol x
I think Alessia is so much like Edwardo 💜💜
Getting so excited to start my own family one day!\n\nLove from the Netherlands🇱🇺
So surprising to look at the timeline photos of Alessia. I forgot what she looked in the beginning. She has definitely changed over the months. She was so beautiful at each stage. She has such a gentle spirit. Will be interesting to see how she interacts with Emilia and Eduardo when she starts crawling and then walking. Such beautiful children inside and out.
You manifested your childhood dreams and thoughts...awesome
UGLY BABY WITH UGLY BIRTHMARK IT LOOKS LIKE AN ALIEN.
How Eduardo says buckle omg😍😍 I can't believe how much he's talking now 😃😃
How happy Eduardo was to wake up, i want what he his having.
Oh my god when me and my siblings were little we had those exact trip traps but one in red and one in a lighter wood I even remember giving up my one so my brother could have it ☺️🚼
Look forward to a future where Alessia feeds her carrots to the dogs on the down low.
Sometimes when they first go in a high chair they lean from side to side ..Take a pillow or a bulky towel and put it on the side of the high chair she leans and prop her left arm on it and after a while she will get used to having it on the high chair instead of her side I had the same probables  with my son ...He first time was also carrots.. I remember the first time he spit them out all over me...But after a ew times he liked them...He hated peas.. you better wear something that you don't really like to wear that much..I love her she is a little Doll Baby ..my daughter was that tiny and we used to call her Sweet Pea.from the flint stones...I love your whole family they make me laugh.....😍😍😍😍
She's such a happy baby Anna! you guys are doing a wonderful job
Amazing guys! I cant believe she is 6 months already!!!! Ive always wanted to buy a calendar but my mum would think its weird i have a family calendar in my room im only 18 😂💗
Jofee? Stop using that song it makes me cry every friggin time
How much fuel does your car drink, you put a full tank in testerday
JONATHAN!  I hope you see this before I go and buy another calendar that I can't write on.  Is this years one different paper than last year?  Can we write on this one with any pen or is it the same one from last year that I can't write on without using a permanent marker?!  Is 2018 pen friendly??
Dear stupid kids \nstop with the same shit like oh i wont not buy a random family calender is just so anoying ok im chill with it but they act like victims and say no body is saying nothing 😳 im chill still but THEY GOT ME THERE LIKE THEY KEEP SAYING SHIT that is out of the conversation like if they wanna fight and do drama do it in another place were no body wants them
The ending made me cry 💕 so beautiful
I have no idea who u lot are
Best way to get downstairs EVER! The Daddy Express!!!
Alessia's so cute! When she was eating, she was playing the piano with her right hand. So sweet.
Aww now I have tears because of that lovely montage! An emotional video for you and me, Jonathan!
☺☺😢😢😭😭
AWEEEE THE END BIT WAS THE CUTEST 💖💖💖💖💖💖
I loved this vlog!!
2:08 HE IS ADORABLE .LOVE FROM SPIDERMAN
U GUYS ARE SO FREAKINNNN CUUUUUUUTE
21 Mins 😱❤️❤️❤️
Baby looks so uncomfortable and shaken.... I feel so bad for her.  Isn't she too small to be eating food like that?  I haven't even seen her grab toys first.  I feel like she was 2 months yesterday and still looks the same.  How has this much time passed?   It doesn't seem like it.  She is soooo petite tiny!!
all they worry is there nasty asses and money there vlogs are so shitty I would not by shit from them low lifes
I bought a calendar ! Eeeeeekkkk soooooooooooooooooooooo excited love your videos soooooooooooooooooooooo much
What happend to you saying welcome to the best year of the whatever month of the whatever of your life

Alessia is soooooooo cute ☻♥ ♥ ♥
Women can be builders
Awww Alessia is growing up!😍
16:39 ahahah😅😅😅
Ahhh so cute!! 💗
Maybe see wants something tastier lol
That poor kid is the family’s pay check... I pray that they stop this and get a real job
Who makes a poster of himself? Only f*cked in the head would Jesus Christ
Very nice pictures... ; D
i wish itsjudyslife would do calenders :(
Eduardo is my fav!
People by this?!
6 MONTHS !!! Omg
Awww
LOVE this!❤️
Scammers and crooks!!!
Alessia is so cute x
I live in misawa,Japan and no one here actually cares about Kim Jon unn
Trump take notes
Nobody nuke Canada :(
relevant clickbait. the best kind.
All these sensors, US ships couldn't even dodge a freight ship or fishing vessel.
Im in china rn, studying abroad. Right now im on holiday break in Panjin and north korea is literally a 4 hour drive from where i am right now. Hella weird
Have you forwarded this video to the U.S. military?
We can fucking kill North Korea with a launch of like the Hiroshima bomb.
No need to stop something that won't hit
How to stop it? Just use a laserpointer on it. Period.
Option 1 do nothing their missiles are crap. Option 2 topple north korea sooner than laterOption 3 actual missile defenceOption 4 prick waving contest
Can some one steal it.
Aegis is no means of defense.\nIt is meant to be a means of escape from RETALIATION.
They might be more of a threat from the EMP, rather than a direct hit. Set the bomb off when it's still above the atmosphere and fry everything electronic below. Also means you don't need to bother coming up with a re-entry system.
Step 1, stop letting America sell them to North Korea
Just because the U.S. signed something with Russia doesn't mean that both country's didn't make something. There's no way we would leave our country underfunded. Plus the U.S. doesn't listen to anyone. We do things we shouldn't but do them anyways
Intercepting a nuclear head is still extremely dangerous. A nuclear blast is harmful at any altitude, anywhere.
3:07 yeah, german navy (Sachsen-class) :D
I don’t understand why humans can’t just shut the fuck up and leave everyone else alone. Do your own thing. Humans are gonna make humans go extinct. We are the only life that we know of. We need to keep ourselves alive and spread across the galaxy and do great things!
Can you do a video of Elon's new BFR, Thanks love your videos! Keep up the great work!
How to make people even more pointlessly afraid of something that is not going to happen.
North Korean doesnt have nuclear weapons. Your next video should about stopping western progaganda and the tyrany  of the US instead of contributing to it. \nUNSUBSCRIBED...
Awesome intro
Could a railgun shoot down icbm?
BMDS more like BDSM
There's always tech that you don't know about. If North Korea tries to bomb it will be recorded stopped and returned to sender. I guarantee that no nuclear bomb will ever go off unless both sides agree on it
Why is there a arrow in the thumbnail man\nWhy?
I am Only young,I feel bad for people like me having to worry the hell out of this thing Because I live In UK if they start Russia battling then we’re dead ;(
What happened to the star wars program were a satalite would fire a beam of energy at a missile in its silo
does anyone else remember when the US Navy destroyed that old US satellite falling back to earth in 2008? We did that with an SM(Standard Missile)from an Aegis Class destroyer. The satellite was 130 miles high and moving at thousands of miles per hour. Not only did the SM hit the target successfully the actual impact point was point on perfect. That was OVER EIGHT YEARS AGO! What we are capable of now has indeed advanced since then....we will have to wait and see
If it worked, how did NK recently fire a rocket over Japan?
Just give some thought as to what happens to a nuclear warhead after kinetic impact assuming that the missile defense shield is not just another load of American marketing bollocks. Where do you think the fallout will end up?
How to stop American nuclear missile ?? They have 6000+ warheads !!
Spray xylene on it-- will rot the rubber bands.   🐸🐸
why don´t they just load a nuke on board a long range super stealth diesel sub and sail it to the port of a major city?
this fat kid needs a spanking
How To Stop A North Korean Nuclear Missile\n\nStep 1. Watch it stop itself in the ocean.\nStep 2. Repeat Step 1
How to stop a ballistic missile\n\n\n\n\nWe have to push the missile out of the way
Blah blah blah... stfu
4:19 WTF?????..... OMG.... Heavy breathing.....
https://youtu.be/m6MOaECL6FM
Fearmonger\nWarmonger
press f
Nuke em first
Don't.
Plot twist\n\n\n\n\nNk ICBM are all fake
Being worried about North Korea, is like being afraid of the boogie man. What you should really be afraid of is Russia. That's like having herpes, except this herpes can actually kill you.
Are we just ignoring the fact that Democrats derailed the missile defense shield just because they hated Ronald Reagan and America? Reagan and every Republican since wanted to fully fund and push for a missile defense shield, but the Democrats just didn't like him and were traitors to America, so they derailed and defunded the missile shield. Obama was  the latest Democrat to do so. Now North Korea wants to launch missiles at us, and we don't have a full scale missile shield.
The way to stop North Korea is to get the loud mouth loser Chump trump to STFU and for the USA to mind its own crappy problems at home and stop trying to tell the DPRK what to do ! \n The USA government is the problem not North Korea or Iran or Syria !
When the warheads are deployed in space you have basically no chance. when they are coming than with 4km/s or 14400km/h. Also It's very unlikely that a nation only fires 1 ICBM. each ICBM can have up to multiple warheads.
heres how you stop NK missile\n\n\n*Read more*
Next up\nHow to stop the imperialism and warmongering of America
noway to stop. all those for show selling story selling arms. try flying.
I want the plan to go wrong so they can't nuke
The fact that this video has been made tells us something about the state of the world right now. Though it's to be expected that when two insane retarded children have a catfight, someone will suffer.
How to stop Stop north korea nudes \n1. Suck your own dick
4:25.....WTF was that?   was that just floating around on micro rocket bursts?
NK starting a nuclear war with the US is like a guy with one snow ball starting a snowball fight vs someone with a few thousand snowballs.
wow, storyblock is amazing!
I thought we just look at it
How can we stop this USrAel terrorism!\nThe world do not need this Rockefeller rothschild capitalism warfare
We are Russia we have superior technology!!!
What if a North Korean sub sneaks through Mexican waters and fires a Missile there? Then What?\nWe got San Diego the Pacific Fleet in danger.
Thaad cannot intercept an ICBM and be useless for protecting mainland USA
It would be suicide for NK to engage in nuclear warfare with the US. Kim Jong Un might not care about his citizens but he still would want to keep his country.
You know shits gonna get ugly when you get these kinds of videos recommended
Let them have their nukes.\nThey are not stupid enough to use them.
Pull the pin and throw it back...?
If NK launched a real nuke, whether it hits its target or not, NK would have been turned to a smoldering wasteland before their missile even reached the terminal stage.

WHAT IS THIS?!! WHY AREN'T YOU PEOPLE PAYING ATTENTION TO IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE THE ALLEGED SUBLIMINAL RACISM OF CHILDREN'S STORIES?
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SDI OR STAR WARS? HOW MUCH IF ANY OF IT WAS DEPLOYED?
It wont happen. Just bullshit in name of nothing. Chine set the rules there and wont let it happen. Otherwise a new Korea north and south come together as one economy and massively grown as territory. Since South Korea produces technology, there you can find Samsung headquarter. Never in this short decades an invasion ou a peaceful union between them will happen. Its just the fear they want you to be real. Once again it shows that the era of corporations world wide is the new order. Welcome to the ilusion of true. Just a bunch of idiots raised by their dog grandmothers that  started our technology with the goal to create the most powerful circus in the world. If you can buy coca cola there, means... Corporations runs the show, because cause all the countries in the world just cant political 'help them' but still, North Korea gives money back to  North America consume that slaves us to support the rich stay cool.
What about dummy rockets to overwhelm the defense system? Isn't that a thing? NK might be able to do that... ?
You have to play Rick and morty musically's in order to stop a North Korea nuke
Reminds me of Missile Command...a game that couldn't be beat.
Send over a TR3B and smash the surface with our kinetic cannon...
Wait did I hear that right, $149 = modest fee?  Maybe it's just that I'm unfamiliar with video making  but wouldn't google.com provide you the same material but for a real modest fee of free?
yet how to stop american drone bombs raining down on children, on civilians, on poor unprotected people in a school, hospital, a marriage or even the side walk .. Assholes like you never make films about the reality .. always hoodwinking .. copying third grade graphics and hollywood trailers .. pathetic trash Duh Engineering Crap !
THAAD isn't even the main BMD weapon. \n\nThe Standard Missile 3 is. \n\nThe SM 3 has a top speed of mach 15+\n\nWe also have various kinetic options.\n\nAnd then there are the lasers.
Thats easy. Just send a commando team to cut the rubber band on their slingshot.
Wouldn't a physical impact on the warhead create what is basically a dirty bomb with a cloud of shredded plutonium in the athmosphere
How to stop a North Korean missle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't do anything
Somebody needs to shoot that asain baby in his fuckin brain
Threath such as Russia... realy?? What about threath such as US?? You are so bias.\nAs I remember only country in the world that used nukes against humanity is US!!!
I think one of the worst parts is usually a nuclear blast sets off an EMP. Which would destroy most electronics.
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
You can't stop whats coming.
It actually made me more hopeful about interception, because I knew it was hard to intercept, but maybe it's not near impossible to stop a warhead flying at 7 km/s.
Even they would lunch rocket to whatever country, NK will be obliterated and all regime will end. so they not stupid. They only want to protect they regime.
No way to stop it ,,,,, my goodness.. are we going to die?????????????
The Israeli Arrow-3 is way better than THAAD and was developed with a fraction of the cost.
North Korea uses their Nuclear Stockpile to sustain their stability in the world stage. The Nuclear weapons are to keep the US at bey, as well as giving off a possible threat of 'nuking' South Korea or Japan to keep their stance on Global Power. North Korea wouldn't dare to launch a 'ICBM' or Nuclear Weapon at the US. However, the US fear of North Korean nuclear usage would keep the US from directly conflicting NK. As well as keeping the Kim Regime standing.
North Korea doesn't want to nuke, or fight, with the US.  \nNorth Korea only wants to frighten the US enough so that they, North Korea, can retake South Korea.  If the US gets involved in such a war, North Korea will lose but if North Korea can scare off the US (or at least delay it) it could win. Will the US be willing to possibly get Seattle or L.A. nuked to save South Korea?  North Korea doesn't think so.
Yes but how can we stop someone trying to stop a North Korean nuke??

All of us got abs man. It's just the question whether it's visible or not... Which I've never seen for as long as I've lived...
When he dances and his shirt flies up and you see his big old saggy skin belly 😐 ruins my lady boner
I like James Corden because he is sexy man
I’m getting so sick of seeing this cunt everywhere. First he appears in every movie, now he’s everywhere in trending.
Haha, funny.  Fifth Harmony - Work playing the background fits the theme I suppose.
I think its unnatural and scary when you can see someone's insides through the skin ;)
This made my day!😂😂

Who needs abs when you can have kebabs
Damn you Corden, I just realized I forgot to watch the other guys dancing 😂 Oh well, replay it is.

Dangerous curves ahead 😂  That's so hilarious!
I thought James was British. But here he sounds Australian. Lol. I love him.

*My* #LOVE... *My Love, My Drug, We're Fucked Up* ! 💞💞
Like how the fuck does anyone put a thumbs down on this, Dickheads!! LOVE IT!!!!
Another reason for us to love Pink.
I LOVE HER!!!! SHE'S ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL INSIDE & OUT!!!
this is so beautiful
Mz Pink!!! You can never go wrong with Pink....NEVER!!  ❤💋
I love how p!nk is soooo real in her songs. Love her
for some reason I want to sing safety dance when that base drop kicks in
Wow, Oh My God, Amazing. she just gets better and better. You rock Pink
GRAMMY YOU BETTER NOT SLEEP ON THIS 👈👈👈👈👈👈👈👈
I thought this will be a Christmas song because of the intro. But I love it yeaahh!!!
Trauma isn't beautiful you insensitive prick. stop romanitcising mental illness just to make money
Better than the first single. P!NK is back!
i love you pink. your heart is in every word you write and sing. you're so true to you, and you will forever be special because of this. love you!!!!!
in love with this song, with your voice, with you dlflslssllskfjea
you need love with man to close case..
Two thumbs up from me Bravo.
reminds me of Just like a pill..love it
OMG I forgot about this song I herd from the radio that pink had a new song and I tottely forgot about
A little bit got christmas vibe in the end of the song. which i love
Love you P!nk from Japan!!
clicked in here from the featured video... Didn't click away till I learned all the lyrics O_O
Eeeeek so excited to cover this!!! 🙌🏾
You are the best! Love from the netherlands xxx
Nice to get a great song after a tragic tragedy
Can anyone please check my recent music video and sub to me?🖤
Pink, we love you
Best song I have heard in a long time!
My Humps My Humps My Humps.... Isn't this song sounds similar to My Humps?
Been waiting.. I love you P!nk. ❤❤❤
She is the best ❤
Thought this was Lady Gaga for some reason.
This song is a beautiful trauma to my soul
Just give me a reason why this song has 1 k dislikes ... Haters gonna hate hate hate
I was front row to see P!nk live at V festival 2017 and she was AMAZING!!!!! She waved at me, held my hand and ran straight over my head in an inflatable ball!!! Check out the videos on my channel ☺️☺️☺️
i thought what about us would be my song of the year but this just has to be my song of the year
P!nk you did again love it perfect song for my man and I can't wait for album release on my lil brothers bday also lovin what u did with the hair liked it so much had to get mine like it
i just can't stop listening to this. it had the same effect on me as the first time i heard 'Raise your glass', within seconds i fell in love with it, pre-ordered the album. i'm gonna have this on repeat for a long time. Pink has still got it. Amazing!
i cant wait 4 the album!!!
I've been hitting replay because I'm trying to understand why this arrangement and style. IMO it's very un-P!nk (to put it kindly). But I never ever thought of P!nk to be someone without brains, so I stuck around longer and kept hitting replay. \n\nI continued scrolling the comments to see if I'm the only one who went WTF (especially after the verse, and even more so at the repeats of 'my love my love'), and then it struck me--IT'S FOR RADIO lmao gotta be similar to all the other trash out there so the majority of people will listen to it, enjoy it (because it's something they're used to), look her up and listen to the rest of her songs. 😂 \n\nI hope I'm right, because GENIUS! Lol
Pink can give any artist a run for their money.  What a beautiful talent
Лучший трек 2017 года!!! \nP!nk на высоте!...
love iiiiiiiitttttttttt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
IT'S AMAZING <3

oh my God p!nk you really never disappoint your fans...thanks you so much i love it.
In love with it
this is basically how I feel having a crush on a straight guy,we are bffs aswell
Been Pink fan since 2001, I was teen in 2006, when Who Knew and U + Ur Hand came. Those years were before we got Kesha, Lady Gaga and Rihanna (Sorry, if Rihanna debuted in 2006, it was long ass time ago).
She is and will always be my rock n' roll girl crush!\nAWESOME... that's my girl!
P!nk imo is one of the only artist who is consistant with great songs! I covered Beautiful Trauma on my channel come over and check it out :)
is it late for me to join the club?! She's so Cool ♥  I love her very very much ♥ ♥ ♥
I love this song! I love all of your songs!❤️
i would spend my savings to be on your concert someday P!nk. you're simply awesome.. this is a very great good vibes jamming song. wow. 😍😍
Pink is a man no doubt
happy 3rd year anniv. my love bryan..... 😙😙😙❤❤❤❤💏💏💏

Nice to see he wants to stay thank god
A good manager, making positive steps..\nI hope Kane continues as he is too. For England and Spurs!
Western populations should shed their illusions. Our governments are committing war crimes and imposing an overseas holocaust on non-belligerent countries. The West and its allies are terrorizing and destroying countries and they are falsely projecting their own high crimes onto their victims.
Have you tried Hourglass Hyalauronic Foundation? It’s expensive but took a few years off my face bc it’s sort of skincare too...
Oh can you pretty please do a Rachel from Blade Runner make-up/hair look?  I'm so  obsessed with Sean Young! 😍
Gorgeous as usual. So beautiful. It would be a tremendous, wonderful thing for you to be seeing a guy or two, or three! If you want to, I say GO FOR IT, SAM! You certainly deserve all that life is about, again, if you're interested. God knows, there will be an army of men calling around, for you are strikingly attractive, intelligent, interesting, and fun! ❤️❤️❤️
how you talk is so cute hhaha
Well done! Turning 40 soon and I’ve been feeling a tad old lately. Any advice for people with freckles and reddish skin? I can never seem to wear blush (too red) and contouring coupled with the bronzer makes me look dirty...
Date girl! Get your life!
Yes please! A video of all the blush colors ! You look amazing 😉
I wanted to say thank you for your youtube channel.  I suffer from mental illnesses and this channel makes me feel beautiful without having to do anything. Nik and Sam, you two make me feel like I've known you for years.  It makes my day when I get to watch a videos.  Thank you two again, Nikki
KiKo is awesome ... love it\nAmazing fast look ... 👍🏻
I'm guessing there's now a humungas queue of men outside your house. Take your pick Mrs, stunning!!!
beautiful! I wouldn't have guessed you're 40 at all :)
You are gorgeous & deserve an awesome guy so get out there!
I just share this every opportunity I get:\nChris Pratt = Crisp Rat.\nAnyhow, love your videos! I also love the sisterhood between you two.
The way you talked about Chris Pratt was so cute...you are gorgeous :)
I love this look. Simple and yet beautiful. Thank you. ❤️
My goodness you look so stunning, young, glowy and gorgeous!😍💕
That gloss in the last makes you just FUCKING GORGEOUS.
That is amazing. Just amazing. Thank you! I'm trying that look ASAP!
Hey guys, I was wondering if you could help. I have to take daily medication that can make me sweat a lot when I'm out and about and I find it really hard to do a face of make up that will then sit nicely, do you have any suggestions? Thank you! Xxx
When I look at you I see so much Bella Hadid!
*So gorgeous!! NEED all of those products, ASAP. BTW~ Isn't Chris Pratt single now??* 😜 𝕏𝕆.💕💋
Hope you went out and about after doing this look-sure to meet a man and get asked for a date! By all means, start dating-you are young, smart and beautiful-go for it!
Please make that Daniel sampler liquid blush video!!! Thank you xx
Like ur nail color maybe u can add info in description box just in case someone likes it 👍🏻
Where do you get your Botox done?
I am sure you’ll find someone to date soon, because you are so gorgeous 😊
I love this look!
Could you or have you done a video on Primers?
Love the Kevyn Aucoin eye gloss! Saw it in one of the previous video's and wondered what is was that you put on your eyelid :)
I really like your personality
You look so gorgeous. And i think you should try dating again 😊
Would really Love to see the Daniel Sandler blush video!!
ARGH!!  I have that one eye lash that grows straight out too...  Boooooo.   It blows!   Beautiful look btw!
Do you use sun protection? I'm wondering because you said about your skin tone changing with the seasons. You always look great and love your makeup looks btw
Definitely do get back to dating Sam! I got out of horrible long term relationship 4 months ago and it left me in pieces. Been dating someone lovely for a month now and I'm over the moon even though I didn't even consider getting involved with a new person for at least a year 😄 good luck to you, gorgeous ☺️😘
Naturally stunningly gorgeous!!!! Love how elegant you ladies are💚💚
You are stunning and funny. Get dating lady ⚘
gonna shoot myself as I will never look that beautiful ever.. :(
Makeup is so lovely. Love natural makeup. On another note your hair colour is amazing. Do you know what colours your hair dresser uses? 🙄 would love a hair change and yours is very natural looking, gorgeous.
Absolutely gorgeous! You are a natural, stunning beauty and I learn so much from watching your techniques! Love me some Pixiwoo!
You look gorgeous however you do your makeup. This one is particularly pretty, though. The UD primer you mentioned...has it been discontinued?
omg please where'd you get your earrings and the necklace??
You have such pretty eyes! I love how dark hair brings out light eyes. I wish mine were lighter.
Good lawdy, I'm only 20 and my foundation ages my skin so much, making me look 80. My dream is to have my skin glow like yours even though I'm half your age :( Dry skin problems
Aaaaah you are sooo beautyful! I love this makeup and I will have to try it!
Hard to believe you are forty. Start dating again and have fun.
Easy piecey...all you need is her gorgeous mug or at the very least her piercing blue eyes...that's all and a bit of lip balm of course. #UghThoseEyes
Lovely 🤗
Wow! Amazing as always!
Gorgeous Sam and good for you and dating😀👍xx
Sam do you recommend the CT Light Wonder Foundation for mature combination skin over 50? Thanks 😘
Go get your man girl!!!!!!
I know you are beautiful, but this is the prettiest I've ever seen you!! Amazing look, loved it!!
Good God is that a gorgeous look! I can't wait to try it out (once I get my acne cleared up...sob!) :)
I love these types of videos Sam when you are relaxed and chatting to us.  Also love this look x
Could you please talk more about the botox that you have? I remember a while ago you saying you'd had it and didn't like it. What changed your mind?
Beautiful makeup! Hope you will enjoy dating again 💓 (men, be aware 😎)
You look lovely Sam. Very youthful and fresh. Love it!
Look forward to the Daniel Sandler vid. Would also love an updated skin routine from both you & Nic. X
The best! Thank you. I'm taking notes - and thank you for the movie recommendations too. 🌸
I've been a bad subscriber and was startled to find out Sam is single! I thought she was dating someone for some time? Can somebody give me the rundown?
Love love the look... I have 4 Daniel Sandler blushes and adore them. I use them on my eyes too instead of shadow. You must get the shade Glow from Katie at Beauty & the Boutique... it's incredible for a sun kissed look. Can't wait for the D/S video
Please do an update on your eyebrows so we can see what the microblading looks like now!!
I’ve never watched one of your videos before. I have to say, this was completely mesmerizing. Incredible. I love your approach to makeup. Thank you!
I literally gasped when you said 40! You look amazing.
❤️ Sam since 2009 your the best!
SAM you look phenomenal- and in the real world, you can do so much better than a chris pratt/ryan gosling type. go get yours hon xo
I am very grateful for your natural look tutorials. That's what I'm looking for and good ones are fairly hard to come by.
Gorgeous! Can you do a full face waterproof make up routine?
i am a fan of the crazy arty looks but i loovooooed this video :) thanks sam .\nhave fun with dating x
Sam you are way too hot to be single, get that dick girl
Hope you find someone worthy of you. Maybe you'll bump into Chris Pratt? 😍
Love your chatty tutorials!
Your skin uhhh so perfict
Gorgeous look!
Kate Moss??

What moisturisers do you use? :)
What happened to Steffo?
Thank you! Gorgeous as always!
Beaut 😍
Ooh ooh! Chris Pratt is getting divorced! 😙
You r sooooo beautiful
Beautiful
Burnt twigs...
You are adorable
#goals
You look just beautiful <3
Blooooooomin lovely xxxxx
Gorgeous! Oh and get dating 😘
What was that eyebrow pencil?
Stunning xx
You are sooo amazing! You should totally start dating Gurley :)
Love you 😘
stunning
Love them earrings
So beautiful 😍
Absolutely beautiful 👌 xx
Beautiful look, Sam!  Did you use your Miracle Complexion Sponge wet or dry?
Out of curiosity, do the CT light wonder foundations oxidise a bit darker?  I thought I'd be a 3 or 4 as I'm Asian but turns out, I'm also very fair, so after a bit of trying and sampling, I bought the shade 2, which seems to suit me!  I love this look as I'm also 40 (though 40+) but I look a few years younger and my style is a more natural look.  I am of course envious of your lush lashes and eyes.  I have very hooded eyes nowadays and it's just not worth wearing mascara or trying the feline flick anymore.  Short false eyelashes from Japan (as they have shorter range more suitable for Asian eyes) work better as mascara just goes all over the hood, the bottom of the eyes etc and makes a big mess... (even waterproof mascara).
Snoop Dogg would be great on here
Excellent episode! Really enjoying this season of hot ones. \nKeep up the awesome work Sean and crew!
I wanna see Harry Styles on this!!
My favorite one so far lol
Do it with dan should be on here!!
i love that she's using a fan
It's tradition around here to put a little dab on the last wing....
I love Wanda. Wish she wouldn't drop down to the level of talking  about politics. Comedians and actors are famous for their entertainment talents, not their political views.
Best one so far!!!
Greg Miller should be on this eventually because wings
Please try to get tyler the creator on here!!!
GET AINSLEYY TO THIS SHOW
I want Sean to give me all my bad news.
GET COREY TAYLOR ON THIS SHOW
Can you stop saying Aggressive brand naming after every time someone says dirty dicks. Ive heard it far too much XD
Don't ask how I know who she is, but get Mia Khalifa on the show
Why does Wanda Sykes and Vince Staples thumbnail of the same?
That Boo at 11:46 had me cracking up 😂
If Wanda Sykes is gay than I am fully erect
shes going to have a terrible night lol, but i respect her.
We need all of weezer or Tom Delonge to come on this show
i'm commenting to boost stats, loved the episode, as always. this season is on fire
I’m just gonna say it, get Liam Gallagher on!
Before and after pic at the end of each vid please!!!
Hot ones and first we feast never displease me thank you for the great content!
That was my first video of this channel. That was funny..
Sean I've been watching from the beginning.   love the sho, but Idk seems like people are handling this new line up of sauces better than the old line up...
Get Boosie on here. It would be funny asl
Behind the Scenes and you don't know Eric or Roger? Ridiculous, they're more interesting than most of your guests!!!
I need a show of her just judging people from photos
My all time favorite Wanda Sykes stand up routine:::::::::::::::::DRINK MAN::::::::::::::::::: http://www.cc.com/video-clips/1xufhy/comedy-central-presents-free-drinks
I used to like Wikileaks, as I used to like Alex Jones. Because I believed they stood for truth and speaking out against governmental oppression and deceit. But they both helped get Trump elected. And even with Wikileaks, it was deliberate.
Wat a minute: Wanda Sykes was NSA?
Do Larry David!
Wonderful woman!
PLEASE get Nathan Fielder! PLEASE
I wanna see garyvee already cmon!
TYLER THE CREATOR
GET JONTRON ON HOT ONES!!!!!
This was lovely.
Wanda never disappoints. Much respect... Fuck racism
Upload the gary vee interview!!
Get Phillip Defranco on here!
JOE ROGAN!
Get Tom Segura
Bessie
Get Gary VaynerChuk !
You gotta get Bruce Campbell on this show! Hail to the king baby.
Can I call my mother? HAHAH
How can I get hot sauce number 10, I wanna try that?
You should try to get lil dicky on the show
I'm 53, I can't eat this crap anymore  Yes, that's me.  I used to challenge places to make wings too hot for me, when I was in my teens and twenties, now?  Oh, hell no.  Wanda, I wish you luck with what's going to happen later on...
I wonder how many wings Sean has eaten in his life
yall need to get gordon ramsay on here
HA.LARRY.US....one of the funniest sessions! You GO, WANDA!
You should do one episode with vegan gains.
I want to see deadmau5
I would have never picked Sykes as a guest and she's one of my favs so this was awesome!
get the Trailer Park Boys eating some wings !!!
Fifa is quite a good game so maybe this app is good but who knows?
Can you please tell your Guests wed love to hear more about them...its not always the wings, tap out or not. You interview the most interesting people that I dont see anywhere else.
Get Arin and Danny from Game Grumps on the show!
You NEED to get THEREPORTOFTHEWEEK on your show!!!!
I'm glad Sean has become a show host and not a interrogator.. he's great at pushing people to punish themselves :D
Get Dave Chappelle or Tyler the Creator
I kinda wanna see Marilyn Manson on this show
Her shirt says amour or A Moor...
Until you've had Dave's Insanity sauce you are safe.
GET MATT STONIE OR FURIOUS PETE ON THIS !!!
JOE ROGAN WOULD BE ABSOLUTE GOLD! He would lift Sean to an even hiiiggghhhheerrrrrr level of conscious. High Ones would never be the same, like a Drake album. Oops. *Hot Ones
Really glad to see Wanda grind it out to the end. She was struggling, but then pulled it together.
This made me feel better about eating my butter chicken pizza with jalapenos and extra chili flakes. ALso she handled it so much better than kevin hart hahaha
You should get Lin Manuel Miranda to try it 😂
Do JP & Julia from Hellthy Junk Food.  JP's reaction would be priceless
Sean Evans, you are a class act.  Your hosting style is pretty second to none.\n\nDave Grohl for a guest?
She's a beast.
*She better put that damn cork in her ass*
she is 53? are you kidding me? she looks amazing!
was about to write first tap out in a long time but she got back in the game. great effort
lot of hesitation but kept going. im impressed. good work, Wanda.
that nigga must of been gay and suicidal for real lool
BILL BURR!
LMAO LMAO LMAO She's awesome!!
Wanda how you feeling? BOOOOOOOO BOOOOOOOOO lmao!!!
Antwan Dixon bitches!
Get doctor brule on here, ya dingus!!
Get Chris Jericho.

Someday she might be funny
Demi has always been a role model for me and it's crazy to see how far she's come. I'm so proud of her. She inspired me and showed me the way. She was one of the main reasons I started writing music, Thank you Ms. Lovato. P.s..If you guys got a minute, check out the music on my channel.I promise you won't be disappointed.
Demi Camila are definitely the new voices of this generation.

You go girl. She is the boom. Thumbs up if you agree.

God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v67V3KtaSno

Literally gagged at the same time you did because I knew you were going to say Splice lol. That movie messed me up, man!
I’m a teacher that wears a lot of animal print at work 🤣 I think I get away with it as I teach performing arts.
That sequin jacket reminded me of the Rocky horror picture show 😀 so cool!!! You have awesome style 😁
I LOVE that leopard print jacket 😍😍😍
Wow this is powerful stuff!!  \nIts Good to know that there's like minded individuals out there.

You've literally just made me buy that sequin jacket!
Lovely haul. You got some nice items ❤
the pink jellyfish top is such a look
On behalf of myself and probs many other school teachers we would wear that jacket too! 😂

That leopard print coat is amazing 😍😩
The background of this video is so aesthetically pleasing. Oh my.
Loads of great pieces, especially like the jellyfish top in pink. Loved you alternative going out lookbook, could you maybe do a similar one for the office, or places where you need to look more put together but want to keep something interesting, edge or alternative about your style (why are all the word that describe that look so awful???).
Love those laceup front jeans, really flattering, especially when paired with both black shirts!
Helen, you need to go and look at BlackMoon Cosmetics. They have a color called Cider and you will be obsessed!
GOD NO IM HAVING FLASHBACKS TO SPLICE NOW HELEN
How did I not know about the discount 😞
120 for all that is pretty damn good, they all look real good on you, although my style is way different I'm not super into the flare and ruffle trend but it looks good on others
Your style gives me LIFE

I looove your style (and just you) so much, man! „Oooooh... it‘s a sleeve!“ 🤙🏻😂❤️

Such cute pieces. I was really tempted to buy stuff in that awesome discount.
Everything looks so good on you! Love those jellyfish tops😄
I've begun wearing cheetah print because of you
You look amazing! Love your style
The tops are perfect on you! You are such a style icon, I feel like I want to dress like you all the time!! Imitation is flattering right?!? Xx
I fucking LOVE the jellyfish top in black <3
I have a question about the Missguided sunglasses! They look really cool but do they have UV protection? :) Love watching your vids Helen, you are hilarious and just so down to earth! Hope you see my comment!!
DAMN HELEN! you look amazing in every single piece
I am living for everything you bought it all looks so nice on you!! 💜

You buy a lot... Often
I love watching these vacuous materialistic first world toxic videos. Fab.
In love with those earrings!
Sucks that coat is alpaca fur and wool... Not cool, so much cruelty goes into that.
Don't mind me, just screaming at my computer, GET THE BOSS BITCH COAT!!!!
I loved this video!
Your haircolor best of ever!!
My goal for this winter is to have a good quality coat I have never had one 😂 and I’m going to turn 23 years old this November so I think it’s time to have a coat 💓 love you so much Sam ❤️
Hey Sam! I have never, ever commented on someone's video before but... there is a first time fore everything right!? Well, I've been watching your videos for years and I love how candid your channel is. Anyway, I have a statement red jumper from H&M. It's in their pricier range, but fits soooo good! The sleeves are baggy and the fit but maintains it's structure and good quality similar to the one you tried on. You should check it out: http://www2.hm.com/en_gb/productpage.0530178002.html
Bourjois didnt overpower your vlog. Love you!
I went thrifting for the check jacket like you mentioned in your autumn looks video. I scored one for cheap, so I'm happy.
I loved this video!! I'm am vicariously living through your daily shopping lol love the jacket !
What foundation are you wearing?\nYour skin looks flawless :)
I want the coat in blue 💙💙
That blue coat😍 it's from other stories too?
omg that drummer man looked like someone soo much.. who the heck did he look like!!
Love this type of videos ☺️💕💕
Think the more 🍅 jumper looks like Velma from Scooby-Doo xd, definitely the boss bitch coat!! The name says it all. I liked the first red jumper and the 2nd :)
I don't mind the AD you put in any video, keep them videos coming Sam, it's awesome! 😄
You looked really good in that first red jumper ! You look amazing in everything though! Lol love the coat on you 💕👑
what store was she in with the boss btch coat ?
Looved the blue coat,but I would definitely go for the one you ended up picking up! I wanna go coat shopping too hahah I have a coat but I want a longer one :P Also liked both the second and the last sweater you tried on you. Looks like didnt end up with either of them though. Loved coming along shopping love that kind of vlog x
Hey guys!!! I've been following Samantha Maria for about ten years, and she's inspired me to start vlogging! If you have time, please check it out... I just started grad school, so I'm vlogging about my PhD experience. Sam, if you see this, I hope you'll check it out, too! (I posted this comment on one other video, but I'll stop now because I don't want to spam :o )
The blue coat was looking super good on you.
Isn't her foundation a little bit orange in this video? Especially in the beginning..?or is it just me maybe 🤔😂
You always look so so beautiful and i love you as a brunette, it is so natural and fresh on you 😘
I NEED that coat.
Samantha you're a sweetheart !! Really enjoyed watching this video, this coat looks great on you :-)
LOVED THIS!! please do more, shopping is my favourite thing xD
Love the lip colour on you! Do you think it'd be good for someone who struggles with applying lipstick?
Loved come shopping with me vlogs, would be interesting to see where you go for coffee/food/drinks when you're in london! I always love trying new places and would be interesting to see where you enjoy going!
Feus de Bois candle is the most beautiful candle at diptique I burn it summer winter spring dont care love it. goes well with the lavender. I burn both when putting my babaa to bed. very soothing.
the Tomato colored jumper was amazing on you! It maked you pop!
You look so good and this was a great vlog!!
I've seen other british youtubers do the Bourjois lipstick test, and their video was marked as an AD. Isn't this one an AD as well?
What was the name of your Jo Malone perfume?  You're gorgeous!
I love the coat.
love the 2nd jumper and the boss bitch coat lol! :)
Love to watch your videos Sam. You look amazing wearing that lipstick and your hair looks so so nice too. You seem so happy and I'm glad for you 🤗 Love the coat and I'm in love with that blue ruffle dress 😍😍😍 Lots of love from Holland
i'm going to head up to london i thought she would be living in london. Anyone can help me here?
I live in Amsterdam and tried the same coat in & other stories! Loved it! So soft. But was a bit worried about all the rain in fall and winter. What do you think? Will it ruin the coat..?
Just watched about 8 of your vlogs 😂😂 #sammicatchup but seriously loved every single one!
❤ your vids so much . You have great understated style
Love the video I need to go shopping with u lol 🙌🏼✨
You didn't really pick the best colour to be testing out because it's so similar to your lip colour. Just a suggestion to try a darker or bolder colour next time
I loooooove the first red sweater
God this channel is shit..
I loveeee ❤️ the black boots. Does anyone know the brand of the boots?
I am OBSESSED with the coat!! I need something like it in my life!
Which red jumper did you choose? My favourite was the second one
If I were to visit London, I would ask you to go shopping with me! love your blogs sam!
Absolutely LOVE the coat 😍
The coat looks so good on you! I definitely think you made the right choice - stylish and classy 😍 xoxo
yaaay I love this blog. where are the high shine pointed boots you were wearing from? x
<3 You pull of so many looks. Love your style. You inspire me to create my own style and experiment out of my comfort zone.
I'd love to see more of these videos 🙌🏼
😍 Oh I love love the black coat! It looks so great on you. I'm from Florida so of corse we don't get the weather to wear a coat like that. Also the earrings are beautiful!
It's interesting to see you debate investing on a winter coat since those are the things I find myself willingly splurging on. About 5 years ago I bought a €150 coat and a €50 and while the first one is still going strong, the second has been replaced after a year of wear because it was wrecked. I would rather invest in such a staple than in trendier pieces such as jackets and shirts.
You look so happy! Love seeing you this way 😊❤
Loved this video!! I really love how we get to see  the thought process behind what you choose to buy and not just the haul portion of the video. By the way what foundation are you wearing because your makeup looks amazing in this video :)
Loved it:) def would enjoy if you do those more :) xx love the coat, suits you so well
I love this video! Here in Denmark we have a coat/Blazer that reminds you very much of the one you looked at in Mango. It's called 'neo noir wales coat', and it's really good quality, and it fits so well!! <3
YES PLEASE, do more videos like this if you can, seriously it makes me feel like I'm with you, going around shopping :D and also its obviously so awesome to be able to see what kind of staple pieces you choose to buy!
I haven't watched you before but this was fun!
I really enjoy come shopping with me videos (:
Yes more videos like this please! Love your coat btw! 👏
That blue coat on you was EVERYTHING 😍😍
The lipsticks look great. And the color you chose looks great. I just feel like they will be so drying. All the long lasting ones are. I might try one. Love the coat you bought.
Love these type of videoes! Definitely do more please! xx
Yeah made my day as usual
I loved the blue one as well :) You looked very nice with it too. Probably I'm telling you because I love blue color.
where are your boots from?
This hair color and texture reminds me of Mariah Carey in the 90s
Well done for vlogging when it was so busy!!! I think I would have chickened out xx
Almost 500k!!! I remember watching your get ready with me while you were in uni
I enjoy your videos because your personality isn't fake and cloying. You just seem authentic and down to earth.
anyone know the song in the back at 6:07?
Song name and artist please @6.23
Loving your hair right now Sam!  The colour the texture, it's so suits you!
When you showef the lip color range; my eye went straight to the color you chose to wear.  It's a lovely color. Good choice girlie. Also, you looked really good in the orangy-red jumper. It was a nice Fall color.
Please do more of these!!! So in love with the coat, great video :)
Loved following you round! Also, as a longtime subscriber it was cool because I knew which pieces were more Sam haha. 😘\n\nI think I will wait a while before getting the bourjois lipsticks.. whenever a brand does a big campaign and sponsors a lot of Youtubers etc, it makes me suspicious. Lol. I want a product that sells itself.
Loved everything about this video!
Lovely vlog! Your style is always amazing :)
Great buys Sammi!
Sam! Your eyebrows looks amazing 😍
I forgot, Zara has amazing red sweaters
❤️
Love your darker hair!
Bourjois lipsticks are amazing :)

What is happening in your head when you have a head ache
Wtf ? Learning in the morning taking a break and learning in the evening is the same as learning in the evening sleeping and learning in the morning, they study at the same times, the sleep at the same times and they take a break at the same times X.x
When was your last video on this channel that you didn't referenced dopamine: the feel-good neurotransmitter at least once?
Learning and memorizing are two different things.
I'd like to see a video on how long you can be drunk for, sometimes I wake up 7-8 hours later and I'm still pretty tipsy and my friend says you can only be drunk for like 4-5 hours if you sleep it off

So,to pass collage all you have to do is go to McDonalds every time you get an A
That's right, sleep is really underrated. Schools need to learn that people don't learn better by having to cram more information. They need to be sane to absorb and understand information. Also, pay your interns.

@laurainthekitchen can this be served over ice?
How dare you, now everyone will know my favorite Starbucks drink! :P

When i dealt with prisoners of war. We would give them starbucks just like you made. They would losen up and be more cooperative. They were star*ucked!!!
It don't look very nice or tasty
What kinda booze would taste the best with this if I wanted to serve it spiked??
Your life, you do you~ YAS!!
Do you think this would work with regular chocolate chips?
I LOVE your make up in this Laura. You look gorgeous :) \n\nThis looks so delicious! I'm not too crazy about white chocolate but milk chocolate is kinda yucky with pumpkin :)
Made this today. Came out amazing! I skipped the extra sugar --- the white chocolate is sweet enough.
my 8 year old sister requests some pumpkin seed recipes thankss love from toronto
Sounds about white to me
is there any thing then  Pumpkin you can use I have a  allergy to Pumpkin
They don't sell pumpkin purée in England tho 😭😭❤️
Dem eyez of laura’s are🤦🏿‍♂️❤️❤️
I can no longer resist the pizza. I open the box and unzip my pants, allowing my pulsating member to eagerly burst free. As I penetrate the steaming, gooey cheese, a shuddering moan of ecstasy breaks through my drooling lips. The mushrooms and Italian sausage are delightfully rough, and the warm sauce feels like heaven. I blow my load in mere seconds, just in time to slip out the front door as you step out of the bathroom. You never discover why that pizza tasted so much better than all the others.
Ofcourse i will make this! Yummmmmy:) thank you Laura!!!
Every white girl's dream. You have done it again Laura.👌🏼🙌🏼
Sounds delicious.  I have pumpkin pie torani so I might use it.
Girl your makeup. Give us sources or techniques. So hot
Definitely looks yummy and just in time for the cool nights we’re starting to have,  a recipe that I’m going to try tfs and just a side note you look beautiful in this video love the makeup 😊💕
Hi i guys I am Laura Vitale andonthisepisodeoflaurainthekitchen LOVE IT!!!
Can you please do a regular easy homemade hot chocolate recipe?
If it's too sweet, add just a touch of sea salt to it.
White chocolate is a misnomer.  There is no chocolate in that white goop
Will try this to my girl's night get together next week 😋
thank you for giving us a real recipe. I've looked at several beverage recipe so far and they included ingredients like instant coffee and other processed ingredients. thank you for being real
People who make fun of people who like pumpkin anything this time of year are jerks stop shamming people for what they like
I've been ordering this at Starbucks for years!!!!! Yummmmm! Now I can make my own!
The Beast System is the Church System... All Church's,Any Denomination, They all are part of the beast system.God Calls us to be the Church. THE CHURCH SYSTEM IS THE STRONG DELUSION.  Pastors feed sheep polluted bread so they continue to look for spiritual highs.. Many People when Jesus comes are gonna say didn't we do miracles didn't we heal or cast out demons but Jesus is gonna say depart from me I never knew you because you were told that God's Law was the Old covenant and that going to Church on Sunday is sufficient to go-to Heaven. THE CHURCH SYSTEM ANY CHURCH IS A LIE. GOD WANTS US TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS!!! COME OUT OF CHURCH AND RELEGION AND INTO GOD'S LOVING ARMS!!
It’s hot out here too in California! Maybe pouring it over ice! Sounds delish to me!
Definitely need to make this because every time I order it at Tim Hortons they give me black coffee :/
Laura I have something you need to try. Egg nog hazelnut cappuccino. It's amazing. I was craving a cappuccino and noticed I didn't have milk. So I added some egg nog and it was amazing!! Someone probably already done it but I love it haha. Mm with whip cream on top and a sprinkle of cinnamon.
This looks great! Makeup is gorgeous
This looks incredible 😍 love love love your make up in this video too - wish you still filmed make up tutorials and make up videos xx
Thank you, thank you, thank YOU for this! I can't wait to try it!
Laura, on behalf of all ladies PLEASE resume your makeup/lifestyle channel again and show us how you created your eye look, it looks unreal!!! I know you are still a new mom and you have commitments but I would love you even more if you could show up occasionally for a good girls chat! Love you
That looks soooo delicious😋😋\nAnd your make up looks amazing 😍\nPlease show us this beautiful make up look in a tutorial 😍
I cant wait to try this with my fam
Laura , this looks wonderful and you look absolutely beautiful . My wife did the same after our first daughter and everyone thereafter .... we (my wife and I) wish you were our granddaughter
WOW i just made this.........it is SOOOO AWESOME!!!   the 2nd cup i have I'm going to add bit of nutmeg to the top    YUM YUM!!!!
I love pumpkin pie! However, most of the things to come from the pumpkin pie spice craze don't have any actual pumpkin. That kinda diminishes the experience for me. I'm so glad to see that yours has pumpkin in it! :)
Yeeeeesssssss! I've been dying for a PSL for years, but have been avoiding caffeine due to past and current pregnancy. Now this preggo can enjoy a holiday drink and make it whenever I want!
Just wandering...\nIF its hot outside AND we really need to try this, can't we refrigerate it for couple of hours and enjoy as a cold drink... 🤗
You just meshed my two favorite drinks together. God bless your soul!  I have to try this.
This looks so good! 😍 I live in Texas and it's still in the high 80's here - can't wait until it gets cold so I can make this for my family and I!
What type of alcohol would be good with it?
Looks lush burn in not too sure off the flavour with pumpkin as we don't use it for desserts in England
Thank you Laura! I need to try this ASAP!
Can someone bring me this Hot drink to my bed NOW!😂😂

Next Episode: Pumpkin Spice White Chocolate Truffles
So making this. 🍁
Vorrei provare a fare questa ottima cioccolata calda, ma da noi manca pumpkin pie spice. Laura, qualche suggerimento, please?
For the past three videos shez wearing the same clothes
anyone else wanting to drink this off her breasts? or just me
you know the best part about this video? It wasn't the fact that two of the most talented people on TV were making us all laugh like crazy. It was the way Jay had to make a shout-out to his parents. No matter how big you get, never forget your roots and to give back to those who were there before your success.
Jay's kanye impression was phenomenal
wonderful
Hello
His Jay-Z impression was on point af 😂😂
😂😂😂they are so darn good
Laughed so hard, these guys are great. Jaimie's zipper hypnotised me though 🤐
They did two different versions of Kanye, and both were accurate!!!!
Jaime with the fake hairline, I see you
This ain't even a hold on fam
Wait, Mom and Dad? 😯 They look like they all came out the womb together! Beautiful family!
should've done a ray charles having a conversation with kanye LOL
I can Do Denzel Impression For You Ellen For 5,000 To My Foundation 😂
You can't say no to the presidential package
THE GREATEST LIKE PASSING THE TORCH!
I gotta get them jamie foxx pants with the zipper in the middle like that
Already know i will like this before it plays...
Brilliant 🙏🏽🤣!!!! Genius 😭😂😂😂🙌🏽🙌🏽 the best segment ever!!
He does Jay Z the best
I guess I'm the only one who thinks this is trite and painfully awkward. Obviously pre-rehearsed like these impromptu games always are on talk shows.
if you can get Jamie to laugh you are funny
This made my week
Dam that kid is good wow shieeetttt
‘ Hold On Fam . You aint bouta put me in the NO ford Focus 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💰
Why the hell did SNL can Jay? Just dumb.
This is why writers exist
LOL The Oprah one and the Kanye one killed me HAHA
This cat Jamie Foxx come out of the closet yet or still hiding
This is what I've always wanted to see! Good team ellen
😂 did they come dress alike? Or it wasn’t planned
I always knew the home alone kid had talent.
Some good head paint in this video
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
His Jay Z was spot on.
Why is Jaime holding back!
nobody wants to be in the Ford Focus
You can't say no to the presidential package😂
This is so rigged
S O ... Illuminati has to give as well as receive ! So that still makes it what...90% receiving and taking. 10% giving and killing. Raping. Molesting etc... Not included
Jay got worst at impressions I swear he still nice but not like his early stuff
A black youtuber, Victor Mann aka Vic Damoane(sp?) admits to beating black woman who disrespects him...Black woman domestic abuse is real in our generation 49:51 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiLtjHvY4yk
I am tried of laughing
They should let Jay do Denzel and Will Smith
I mean yo buy the damn cookies 😂😂😂
Intentionally kept secret temple from tourism Cricut in Bangalore \nhttps://youtu.be/CzjIbL89PTE
...Barack Obama and Beyonce...  And to answer your next question, Yes. It is because they are black, like most prominent political figures and entertainment performers.
They both talented and funny 😂
Obama  😂😂😂😂😂
Old kanye v New Kanye
Coookieees!!
COOKIEEEEEES!!! EVERYBODY GET THE COOKIEEESSSSS!!!!! COOKIEEEEEESSSS!!!!!! 😂😂😂💀💀💀💀
OMG #KANYEWEST WAS AMAZING.
Epic
Kanye 😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂
4:44
Am I the only one in love with Jay Pharaoh at this moment?
relieve stomach second largely institution full consultant angel.
And what is Jamie Foxx net worth again? Why can't he donate to help Texas why does he have to do an impression right so another company can donate???? Come on wake the fuck up
Jay should Raw or Delirious he would kill that.
I'm sorry Jay pharoah just isn't funny sum of his impressions r good others not so much
Check out this new South African banger right here https:youtu.be/Dkv-hz0IANk. It's a wavy hip--hop record you'd bump on your way to a lituation somewhere coastal and sunny. Check it out and tell me where you're watching from in the comments. Shout out Chiraq, Rèunion & Namibia for showing us love!
So happy Jay has been noticed by Jamie Foxx :D
Lmfao omg they r so good

Jamie passing the torch
Should've done dmx

#ihateniggers
Obama with bey booty LOL #dead
Fantastic entertainment....
Jamie got the smoothest n sharpest hairline
HOOOOOOOOOOOT
That jay z impression !
That jay z spot on lol!
When he did Kanye 😭😭😭
Oh my 😂😂😂
Was that a fart noise?\n\n 2:23
Damn Ellen u too sweet I love u
😂😂😂
It seems like they asked Jay what impressions he does every time he's on TV and then just gave Jamie people who don't have any notable speech patterns
M
gotta give it up for jay pharaoh you can tell he came from a good family. parents look like good people.
Omg.they are so hilarious.
😂😂😂😂😂 dope 🙌
Jamie Foxx❤❤❤
KANYE WAS SPOT ON WTF
Kanye haha
That kanye is stellar.
Too funny!!🤓

hahahahahahahahahahahahahaaaa
Jay 😂😂 the goat

She went to a goa party and ended up in detox lol.
Liked the book. Don't like the director.
Female soldiers?  The priests from the west's new religion are sermonising to the masses again I see. Poor old sci-fi, I remember when it used to employ actual human reality as a foundation to build its fantastic imagery atop. Now it's little more than another hijacked item to preach the west's latest junk religion from. All the churchgoers singing from the same hymnbooks, just like all churches, while reality carries on regardless beyond the temple bounds.
The book is so good! Really looking forward to this.
Oh my gosh so excited I read this series it was amazing 3 books total can't wait to see the similarities to the book. Highly recommend reading this series it's a trip!
So they're walking into area X in this film they seem to know where theyre coming from and there are 5 people this time instead of four. I wonder if those slight changes meant anything, can't wait! :D
I think I know what happens based on the title *ANNIHILATION*!
no offense but oscar isaac is very handsome
Your weapons are obsolete, humans!
Too thin a teaser to get me interested
In the book, the linguist didn't make it through the border so there should be only 4 FEMALES in this expidetion. I'm starting to doubt this movie.
Get out of here STALKER.
Wow...we are going to have a lot of fun #Paramount ^_^
Great trailer, and probably and even greater movie. I.can't.wait.
Some kind of alien life form trying to replicate or alter earth-based life? Maybe?
This looks good, hope it doesn't be bad like other book adaptions
Idk why i just really don't like Natalie Portman in like any movie shes in lol. I feel like shes always the same character. I'll give her props for Black Swan but thats like it fam.
I was hoping that being the fifth commenter on this video would accomplish something before it went viral. Oh well.
meh
wonderful
hjj
Sigh...
Arrival meets Avatar
I'm in..!
BWAAAAAAAAM
Its another pretentious jerkfest.
Gurl power.\nInstant dislike.

give me that video.. 'the _ that wasn't me I don't have a car
i wonder if she can see a glimpse of her future daughter
Choice title, February 2018? Unfortunately, the way the world seems to be going, none of us will be around to watch it.
Couldn't they find a least authentic actress than Natalie Portman for this role?
Looks like live action ( Origin: Spirits of the Past )
Why is it that the most beautiful things tend to be the most deadliest???    Can anyone answer me this?
all the single ladies, all the single ladies
looks like a mixture of several SCP's
0:19 wth I can literally count every frame when she moves...
I don't think Portman can play a very good Ellen Ripley.
Reminds me of the signal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwgfeR2pMuE
This looks like the trippiest movie in a long time.
Be prepared for disappointment - the novel series didn't have a clear ending
I read the book this summer, and while I have no idea how they're gonna convert it into film format I hope they do well because that shit was fire

Looks good - nice cast, written and directed by Garland, who made one of my favourite recent sci-fi films in Ex-Machina (which rightly catapulted Alicia Vikander to superstardom).\n\nLet's hope the studio doesn't water everything down into mediocrity like they usually do.\n\nAnyway - I've decided to watch this, so I WON'T be watching the main trailer, because that will obviously spoil everything [you can set your watch to these trailers and predict almost every main event in the movie]

Now that's how you make a trailer!
reminds me of the russian sci fi classic Stalker kinda
I kid you not, I just started reading this book from my school library!
It would have been great if a movie like this was about going into another dimension!
that chinese guy has been busy\n\noscar isaac and natalie portman makes this a definite must watch
Oh yes, the Southern Reach!

this my shit
i wont watching any with zionists
Pants
...the fuck...?
I'm in.
Natalie!!!! Yes baby!!!
umm........WTF!
Alicia Vikander = Natalie Portman
looks like someone dropped paint in dish soap. Ok that's a wrap folks. We have a movie.
another feminist bs, this time a zionist feminist
Yet another ridiculously nonsensical piece of fiction about the spiritual aliens... I ... just can't. I can't anymore. The creativity of the movie industry is definitely annihilated. Once movies were art, now they barely deserve the a of it, and that too only those indie movies that flop horrifically at the box office \n*sighs louder than the video's audio*
Just put together Stranger Things and Ghostbusters
SHE IS SO FUNNY
React to In a heartbeat!!! (Short film) I’ve been watching videos like crazy and I came to see if y’all did one.
It is so strange to watch Mitch reaching high notes with this mustache
Omg they both are sexy I would date either. #cute 😜😍😘
Hey I'm new to your channel this is my first Video I've ever watched. Keep up the entertainment. By the way is two trans?
Omg\n Mitch's favourite song is the same as mine!!!
Im really confused. Are these the same guys as asapscience?
I love Mitch's Freddie Mercury look!!
Mitch watching True Blood is all I need.
She is HILARIOUS in The Good Place.
I love the most is they always put their weekly obsession and also their week songs they love ! I mean I wish all YouTubers would do that !
I just watched their first videos and I'm literally crying I'm so proud of y'all ❤️
It feels like forever since the last time you’s sat in front of the camera 😂❤️
when Hoying said One Piece i literally thought he meant the anime
I laughed so hard through all of this
Aaaaaa congrats guys! You guys are killing it, keep up the amazing work!
Why do they both look so sexy rn
Every time I come back to this channel, Matts image is always different
THE 'STACHE IS TOTALLY WORKING
I'm such a fucking weeb, when Scott said one piece I immediately thought Mitch was gonna reply with a one piece character goodness me
If y'all don't make a Guy.exe video that's basically a Weird Science parody, it's going to be a real missed opportunity.
Post Malone wrote I Fall Apart because Mitch forgot about him.
Is it just me or is Mitch copying Scotts facial hair? Either way, keep it up Queens! ❤️👑👑❤️
If you want a good show with hot boys in leather BBC The Musketeers.
How ironic is this, I missed a superfruit notification, because I was doing a superfruit binge 😭😂😂😂❤️❤️
The album is amazing! Congratulations ❤️
i was hoping the names would be like \n“my name is horse”\n“my name is cowboy and i’m gonna ride you”
You're trending on YT and Im a proud momma!
God she is funny
All of the shirts that Mitch wears, I want
It really showed you both would be awesome if you had an indie film. Road trip film for the summer maybe? Everything you do is GOLD... at least... & Platinum.
SCOTT DID THE FALLING ASLEEP THING AGAIN AHHHHHAHAHAHAHA
omg I've just started watching true blood a fare days ago and I'm freaking obsessed with it!
i love these music videos SO much, but I'm excited for sit down videos like this again, you guys are killing it with balancing them though and its insane how far this channel has come in such a short time:)
Who else thought of the kpop groups when they said one piece and two piece
Only 90’s kids will remember the time when this was called ‘HURRY UP BLOOPERS?’
When Scott said One Piece I was secretly hoping that Mitch would say Cowboy Bebop because of his shirt 😅
I was waiting for Mitch to say and my name is Two Piece and A Biscuit.
Lol she said my name. 😂
THE GOOD PLACE  THATS WHERE I KNEW HER FROM

Now do you have a BEARD Mitch?!! Oh and BTW there's this app called Flipagram and I believe you shall get a account of flipagram!
Holy shit I missed that intro so bad, I started crying.
I can't stop listening to your album. I love it so much
i was hoping for Deny U music video this friday
Mitch. Bring the septum piercing back and throw the porn stach out! 😂
Mitch looks different everytime I see him 😂😍
4:18-4:33 what every scomiche shipper thinks. She knows what's good!!
Mitch what the fuck is up w ur hair and facial hair.
at first I didn't like Mitch's mustache, but then I started watching Parks and Rec
I’m obsessed with future friends
I GOT THE ALBUM LAST WEEK AND EVERY SONG IS FIRE!

Bruh is he a trans
Cum guzzling tramps
These guys are faggots
Are they still in pentatonix
Hey dudes! You guys are fags!
What software are your animations in?\n\nDo you do it frame by frame?
in just 10-14 videos you ll get 1m subs arnold and will get a gold play button \nthat will be a record \ngood job Arnold \nresult of your sacrifises
which software do you use?
Before : Meet Arnold.\nNow : Try to kill Arnold.
Send him to a volcano
what if you froze in a freezer?
Put him in deep ocean!
SUBSCRIBE AND LIKE THE VIDEO FOR MORE WAYS TO KILL ARNOLD
Meet Arnold is probably better than Jake Paụl, but still lose Logan Paul
How about Arnold in a washer?
Ima lose it STOP TAKING HIS FINGER OFF
Make what happens during a nuclear blast
why does his finger always fall off!?! and you make mistakes by the fingers its like he gets a replaced fingers
Can you please make more videos
I aM dEEEEEEEEpllkgy offended by this vid.                                                              😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠              😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠
Put him in the refresherater for 1 days
Let Arnold make his adversely all of his brutle experment.
- next video you should do what would happen if you stayed in distilled water for your whole life
Send Arnold into the YouTube comments
Put Arnold in a grenade
Wait. IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE. Idk you give it a go Arnold good job so far but I'll bet you won't make it this far
What if only 30 seconds
What if you vacuum sealed Arnold? 😂 id love to see that.
How long would you survive in the north pole with no clothes?
Yay a new video! I loved it!
why must you create a character exclusively meant to get killed not even kenny would stand for this shit
Met arnold he is wet, dirty mind activated
can you do a what will happen to you in a blackhole?
I Would Just Use A Simple Towel To Dry Him.
Ummmm... I think he disintegrated. Is that a bad thing??? No, I guess not, so you're probably right. ;D
What if Arnold get stinged by a Black Widow Spider
What happens if you were to shapeshift? EDIT: The effects and would it be painful?
Next one put him in a refrigerator because of the heat
make him watch jake paul
Arnold must of done some really fucked up shit in his life. Murder, torture and possibly wrote a bad check or two.
This makes me feel even worse for all the poor animals satanic children have put in the microwave out of curiosity. I'd always hoped it was a relatively quick and painless death.
How to make someone have a painful death:\n\n\nPut em in a microwave.
Make him go in a pool of radiation
You should put Arnold in a black hole
Send him into his own hair.
TBH I can imagine Arnold in a hurricane but what will happen to his body when he is outside the whole time in a hurricane???
Try and mumify Arnold alive, or preserve him like beef jerky
I was expecting him to explode
You should make “kill the Arnold” App where you can like cut him and put him in space or volcano and stuff
What can a lot of centripetal force do to arnold?
What would happen if Arnold was shot by a cotton ball going 136 times the speed of light
What will happend if where stuck on a cross
But who the hell will enter to a microwave
What happeneds if you are in a freezer
Arnold I have problems
Anyone see the channel and looked at the about °.°
Put arnold in a nuclear explosion
Well .... im not sure that im able to fit in a microwave
I'm gonna show this to my brother Arnold.
How about staving Arnold - what would happen?  And how about not giving him any water?
I don't think you should make any more videos because that's the final time that Arnold got killed
do\nwhat will happen to you were sliced in half (hips/belly)
Put Arnold in an amine battle against Goku or something\n\n\n\nTop 10 longest anime fights
So in the next episode he starts out as a pile of ashes ... hmm ... interesting!
Next time on hi bitch
Middle of the ocean
put Arnold in the Chernobyl Meltdown
Can we give Arnold a break? Like send him to a hotel!
-Oh what a sadistic fucked up video on a poor man dying- wait what I meant was when is he going to die and when are you going to end his pain and suffering???
It's obvious he isn't aloud to keep all his fingers
I guess I should get out of the microwave
its not a meet arnold's video if arnold himself doesnt loose a finger.
Make arnold go in a tornado
You could’ve just used a towel but yeah I microwave is probably much better >_<
can you send arnold to the center of tornado, and tell me how he can survive?
Could Arnold survive in the big red spot of Jupiter?\nCould Arnold survive on the surface of Pluto? \nCould Arnold survive in the Poles of Mars?\nCould Arnold survive a Supernova?\nCould Arnold surive in Chernobyl without a suit?
In almost every video Arnold loses his finger.
give arnold the opportunity to visit the coldest part in the universe only for 1 nanosecond
Do how long can you survive without food or water!
oh no did he die this time??
Epic you are epic
Please black hole
damnit stop abusing Arnold!
Arnalod :imma just swimming OH NO IMMA KIDNAPED NUU DONT PUT MEH IN HERE
1 minute smh, don't subscribe.
Arnold needs a brake
Hehe... wet
what about a steamroller
Happy tree friends

Make Arnold to go everest whitout equipment
Still missing one Finger
wut would happen when your innards turn outwards
He looks crunchy. YUM!

How many fingers dis je loses
XD
OMG this was unexpected. I can't wait to buy this one and add or to my collection. Much respect sir David Attenborough and BBC earth
I can't explain how beautiful this...  😍😭
300 Martians disliked... \nLets unite for the love of our planet and protect it!\nPraise God/The Causer/The Maintainer/The Sustainer/The Necessary Existence
Beautiful. There is something greater than us
Why is it named the prequel? For some reason i thought it would be like cgi of the sea life millions of years ago.
And were ruining everything. Wherever you are, take mother nature into consideration the next time you step to the ballot box.
Lord you are amazing! Your creativity knows no bounds! Thank you for this amazing earth You have given us.
Making a number two of a movie is nothing but if it's a documentary it is something
Still coming down from Planet Earth II and now this is coming out. \nIf BBC earth were a woman I'd propose.
What a captivating achievement; I'm so excited!
Wow, some of these shots seem to be fake so good they are. I even had tears in my eyes watching this from the emotion, can't wait! Praise and love mother earth.
The first blue planet was basically my childhood. I am so hyped for this, especially after how amazing planet earth 2 was
Every screen shot is a wallpaper
Life is so incredible! The photography in this is truly awesome. A magnificent spectacle. So extremely beautiful. We better enjoy it while we can, because nuclear waste is invading this priceless creation. Thanks to mankind the planets virus! Soon to be the universe's virus. Way to go! Shame... Shame.....Shame!
I'm excited for the series, but what about that fat pilot whale!
I'm so amazed at all of BBC's Earth documentaries. The kind of work that must go into getting this kind of footage is mind boggling.
The fact that this video isn't in 4K is disappointing. Planet Earth 2 is one of the best looking documentaries on 4K UHD. I'm sure this will be equally good if not better.
Blue planet, the stuff we're allowed to show you. Lol
One of the Greates documentary with Wallkig with Dinosaurs. Im back to my teen-young age. The Sountrack by George Fenton (2001) is outstandig!
The bed by Tom Jones
I knew Aquaman would be an awesome movie!
The genius minds of Sir David Attenborough and Hans Zimmer and Radiohead ❤️❤️❤️🐙🐬🦑🐡🐋🐟🐳🐠🦀
Would already be SO great regardless BUT as soon as I heard Radiohead come on... damnnn 😉
Didn’t need the awful singing
Thankyou for making it...so beautiful.. GOD IS GREAT
its looks amazing in every way its my dream to see\n the world
Cannot wait for this
I don't understand how anyone could dislike this, let alone 292 people.
Please God never take this man away.
Yet another epic soundtrack from Hans Zimmer
Salute to you all the way from NZ Mr Attenborough!!
his voice is one of a kind... i have never heard ne1 like him. a rare gem.. amazing documentary with great voice.
What horrible music to go with some of the best wildlife footage ever.
As a canine this trailer makes me all warm inside
take my money and my soul! THIS GONNA BE EPIC!
some of this stuff is so high quality it almost looks CG
Omg I cannot wait to see this it looks fantastic
This world we live in is so beautiful, the thought that someday all this will disappear makes me so sad.
Kinda sucks that BBC is a channel, but BBC is sadly also slang term for a big black guys....well ya know......
the photography and art direction is stunning!! I can't wait to watch it!!!
The music is already just yes
@4.06 what if you were to stick your chicken in there?
Such footage plus Hans Zimmer and Radiohead music.... This is some epic stuff!
YOU BETTER NOT DO THE BABY SEA TURTLES AGAIN...
wow these guys are really taking it to the next level on this one, the HYPE is real!!!
This has alot going for it. Amazing stuff.
281 people have no souls. The most epic music, photography and narration we have ever seen. Period.
where do i get this??
Thank you BBC earth
Great soundtrack
Gotta love his voice!
So much vast
David Attenborough.  Enough said.
Next level quality.
Wow
so beautifull
what an awesome song!!!!
The most majestical collab I could ever think of
Ermegerd! This cinematography is Amazing!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvC2RW0tW0M the soundtrack..
anybody else keep watching this over and over just for the music?
gonna blaze up for all 6
When does it come out ?
I remember watching the trailer for the original Blue Planet when I was 10. In that time I’ve become a PADI Advanced Open Water Diver and now sponsor Hawksbill Turtles with WWF. Can’t wait for this to return!
Goosebumps to the maximum with the song
When does this air on BBC ?????
thank you more than so much about this video
Who actually disliked this video? I'm truly puzzled.
What have we done to this beautiful earth , fighting fighting and fighting\n\n\n\nI'm so inspired by this vedio ,that I am going to start a campaign ,by God
Please consider veganism! Why would anyone want to destroy beauty like this with overfishing? It will never fail to baffle me. We need to protect marine life, now more than ever, as it is likely many species will be extinct by 2050. It may seem a long way off, but in the grand scheme of things, this is a minuscule amount of time to cause such irreversible damage to our beautiful planet.  They don't belong on your plate, they belong in the oceans. Please, please help keep them there, supply and demand. If enough people stop contributing to our ocean's exploitation by buying fish, there will be no profit in it and they will have to find another source of money. Hopefully a much less destructive one that allows these incredible creatures to live out their lives free of suffering and pain.

We all came from the sea, this is our god
I feel strange for being this excited for a documentary. <3  And is it my headphones or is the sound mixing slightly off in this trailer? Sounds like his voice is drowning in the music a little.
Calm down. We've discovered not more than 10% of the ocean life. Many more to come.
Can't wait!❤️
Music name plz??From 1:00 to.1:30

Radiohesd? How depressing.
I found Nemo in 2:32 but I didnt find Dory haha
David my G
Hopefully that awful music won't be in the actual show
Man, humans are disgusting. I watch this and wonder how long we've got left on this planet. Far too beautiful for some of the twisted Homo sapiens roaming around on it.
What cameras do they use to get those underwater shots???!
Its funny how it perfectly fits on his trunk
I like how he drove by the first time casually to scope the place out.
So they are using kids now...
That did fit so perfectly in the back of his car, i would forgive because of that reason alone.
Cops later pepper sprayed and tazed this kid.
Quick right down his license plate number
not cool.
Hilarious!
This kid is going places. \n\nPrison --- to be exact.
to be honest i'd be happier that my neighbour is holding my package for me than having it left out like that!\nwhere i live it'd be gone within minutes!\n\nif i saw a package abandoned on my neighbours driveway i'd probably take it in too, \nand post something through their letter box letting em know i have it :P
the parents probably told him to do it , goes on alot .
It annoys me more that the kid is driving all through the neighborhood yards. Wtf is up with this kids parents?
what a fucking asshole. If i was the person living in that house i would go over and kick the shit out of him

She's a blessing. This interview made me really love her!
i do NOT believe Tamar about the tapping spirit giiiirl really? Vince did it?...Mkay tay tay
She looks so cute,love this interview so different from other😚😍
Every time she talks about Toni and Birdman it's funny
This was a great interview! I love this new Tamar...happy for her!
Yass, some banging singles will do well!! Good choice TAY-TAY!!!
Wendy genuinely likes Tamar she's respectful to her... unlike her unusual disrespectful self
she said Brrrrrr Man😂😂\nI love you TayTay
Tamar looks so good without make up
Look at My Tay 😁 Love her!!!
She really just motivated me 🙌🏾
This interview was magnificent!!
*Every Racist Has A Black Friend*  The #1 Music Download of The Day \nShare and Order You're Right here    ( http://cdbaby.com/cd/stonethug52 )
I like this Tamar Braxton better than the over the top get your life Tamar.
My breasts are still mine so lets embrace them... for now. She's pregnant.
She would be a great motivational speaker. Just need to focus.
Tamar has really grown! I'm super proud of her she stayed true to herself but she definitely has evolved!
It's a nice video. But you can refer to the secret How To Fix a Marriage and Make Your Spouse Adore You Again in this link: http://bit.ly/2vNBJSw
Tamar I love your outfit! I can see you have matured a lot.
Lord bless you and your family Tamar B.
Who is Tamar’s stylist? Looking like we needs ya put her in an oven. 😂🤣😂
TayTay might be the only person on Earth that Wendell ain't shading 24/7!!!!😘😘
Ugly as fuk...both of these dykes
Why is Tamar not one of the judges on American Idol?She should be getting the 25 million dollars and not katie
Tamar gave the BEST interview so far this season and we're just getting started, Wendy!!! Thumbs up for Tamar getting her own show!!! 👍🏾
Tamar is a true Pisces!
Love her!! What a great personality and Skin ahaha <3 Love you tay tay
I love Tamar
im here for it Taetae :)
Wow she looks amazing!!!!😘😘😘💕
Social media is so messy!\n\nAlso, I didn't  understand Tamar's response when Wendy asked if what she had on her album cover was a body suit. Did Tamar say yes
I see a lot of growth and change in her and it's for the better. You can tell she's following god. I will say you can tell she had some work done.
She’s such a real person! Go Tamar!
Wendy looks good here hair and makeup
She's doing that lil kim proud by looking more modified every time she appears
She seems like a lot of fun
The hell she got on tho?
Tamar is the beautiful badd friend that everybody wants☺🇺🇸
she changed a lot I'm happy for her I can watch her in this space she was to over the top b4 but congrats Tamar.
I have to be honest. Tamar is ENTERTAINING. I was cracking up and rewind this like crazy hahaha
I love Tamar's boots...Girl where did you get it?
Damn I wish I had a friend like Tamar!
I love me some Tamar.
The Real is so bad without her involved.
Tamar is so awesome! I'm loving her look and her nails are incredible!
I love Tamar! She's always kept it real, one hun! I'm so glad I watched her to derived my own opinions about her!
7:30 The nostalgia hit hard. I love the Muppets!
My god I just want to hang out with her!
Im really happy for her. It looks like shes matured a lot and took time to really focus on being a better person. Hope she continues to grow
 I have no issue with nobody but the devil lmao I looooove Tamar 😂😂😂
Tamar looks pretty. I definitely can't wait until Toni Braxton comes back on here💜
why did I think Wendy was going to go for her butt when she hugged. Tay lol!!
She's picked up some weight!! 😍😍
Tamar seems so sweet and humble. The boots are 🔥🔥🔥🔥.
And The Real has not been the same without Tamar!
Nice interview. But why she hug my sistuh like dat? 21:28 lol
It's not Tamar isn't a interesting person. It's just that for daytime t.v. as a host (like when was The Real Daytime) I can see way her personality wouldn't work nor did it last long. Tamar can sing her was off but I think she needs to stay doing reality TV and or become a judge on something or even a host for like Love & Hip Hop kind of shows. Basically anything late night tv would be nice
Beautifull  I love  her  new take on life  always a fan
Shi walk in lik MI's nene
A*2*the*MEN! HUNNY!!!! TELL IT TAMAR! I completely understand
She so funny im so confused as to why she wld say this is her last album she been tryna do music for so long.. now this the last album? Hmm
she's thick!  what happen?
I really really likeTamar. She has this bratty but very down to Earth factor.
That’s one thing I wished interviewers would ask these artist! Tell us about the cover art work! Obviously, it has to mean something to them in order for them to have selected it. Unless, it was done by the record label it helps make sense of their music and album as a whole.
In love with the outfit
This is coming from a woman who thought nothing of Tamar!  But great job!  And I wish you well on your growth journey!
Tamar is so misunderstood.  I appreciated her honesty.  God Bless Ms. Tamar!
I’m here for the entire outfit! 🔥
The way she said birdman....😂😂😂😂
Is that the hypothermia blanket hooker look?
Tamar's blend game is on point! Love this makeup artist!
I just believe Vince never wanted Tamar to have professional independence in the industry.  I hope her decision to not make another album is her own decision and not an attempt to please her husband.  Tamar you are still doing a lot with your career so leave The Real situation behind you.  Don't allow that situation to control your mind and destroy relationships with others around you.
That dress and boots!!! Love!!!!!!
Realizing How much I missed this girl remember He tried it, Get ya, your life Yess T do your thing ❤
Tamar is my spirit animal when she start going down that list of people she unfollowed 😂😂😂
I love love Tamar! !!!! I want your shows back Tamar!
I love her outfit!
One of my faves, gotta love Tamar!!
My breasts are still mine...😩... oh the shade... but unknowingly
I wish it was longer she's very entertaining!
💖💖💖
Love you tay 😍😍😍😍

Tamar need to understand that unfollowing and unfriending others on social media speaks volumes nowadays. Totally understand why Monica decided to one-up her and block her.

Hell yeah!!!! you nailed that pizza. you're the best, Matt Stonie.

This is how much I eat for dinner in a night....
I'm curious. How do you feel after you eat so much? Do you feel sick, because I would get sick from eating 5 slices.
I can't tell if this is food porn or food torture
When i'm hungry around 5-6 min is a standard time :)
This has to be the dumbest Youtube Channel I ever seen since PewDiewhatever that dumbfucks name is.
Impressive!! But why fast forwarding when it only takes you 1min 28sec to finish it?? Little annoying...

Cheating on diets be like
do Andy's lunch from the Breakfast Club
how are you not constipated..
You should do 100 bags of cotton candy. 😍 it's my favorite
Just how do you train for this?
Yo Matt, I love the old vids and the new ones are great. You want to tell us how good it tastes fucking do it. It's your vids.
Neither of those attempts were valid, though... you didn't conform to all of the rules. In the first attempt, you didn't say your DraftKings username or #DraftKingsPizzaChallenge (rule 2), and in the second attempt, you again failed to do both those things and your timer was not in clear visibility during the video (rule 2 and rule 4). Then again, being a sponsored video probably made you well more than $100, so I guess you didn't need to win the challenge anyway.
How is he not a fatso yet???
imagine if he spent 200 bucks on normal priced 14 inch pizzas, that would be a epic challenge
Matt, you should just do livestream of eating tons of food, I mean I kinda want to see you savor your food.
Matt you have Brazilian subscribers, put Portuguese subtitles in your videos ❤

When Mbappe is more matured than Neymar/Cavani/Alves combined.
Bayern are trying to finish 3rd so they can face Arsenal in the Europa League  knockout stages and beat them again.
Mbappe destroyed Bayern what a performance
Where's Arsenal in the programme
United need to start playing some passes back rather than just shooting, because they had players in much better positions. This could've easily been 7-1
5:33 is messed up listen to the audio
It's looking good for the English teams
A English team is definitely going far in this tournament
Steven Gerrard is honestly one of the worst pundits. He talks nonsense every week. He talks about Atletico never being torn apart like that yet Real Madrid beat them 3-0 twice last season
Lol RIO is such a Londoner I love it it's illegal 😂👏🏾
Even Celtic have won more than Looserpool lmao, currently the worst British CL team and the embarrassment of English Football (Apart from Arsene Wenger FC).\nChelsea, City, United and Spurs are class 👌
Gerrard always salty about Rashford and Man Utd in general
Lukaku too powerful
As a Man Utd fan I'm really glad Chelsea won. It's good to see English teams putting up a good fight in Europe right now compared to the horrendous few seasons we've had before in Europe!
How does Costa feel now?
Martial FC
No surprise from Stevie g to make comment like that about a Manchester united player saying mbpappe is world class and not rashford
Its illegal what he's doing, not allowed, get out of the stadium
All UK teams \n\nMatch Day 1\nCeltic - Lose \nMan City -Win \nMan Utd - win \nSpurs - Win\nChealsea - Win (sorry if i spelled wrong )\nLiverpool - Draw\n\n\nMatch Day 2 \nCeltic - Win \nChealsea - Win \nMan Utd - Win \nSpurs - Win \nMan City - Win \nLiverpool - Draw\n\n\n This shows that liver pool are the best team in the champions league
Bt sport are great this year but they need to get rid of Owen
Wrong commentary at 5:30
English Teams 👏👏👏👏 But Liverpool🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Neymar>Mbappe<Lukaku>Martial<Morata<
Lukaku is the definition of a overrated tap-in merchant.
Come catch up with whether my door is locked
if mbappe is world class then what does that make gabriel jesus
What's with the music?
Boom CHELSEA CHELSEA ARE THE BEST ARSENAL FANS DONT MESS WITH US
stevie, micheal owen was world class at 18, he won a ballon d'or and everything!
Neymar right now is on his own at the top, best player in the world.
Check out the full fight video of England cricketer Ben Stokes on my page
I would love to see an English team in the CL finals
The music for Juve made me think Dybala hit the post haha
BT's pundits are the worst. They do remember Madrid tearing them apart last season 3 times right?
Mbappe is so LIT 💥 its almost illegal what he's doing in the pitch ⚽️
Now what happened to the commentary at 5:33
got the commentary wrong at like 5:50 with lewandowski
Manchester United best team in England ❤️
Martial >>> Mbappe
Never thought the team id be happy to get in the last 16 would be Barca
The commentary at 5:43 does not refer to what is being shown on screen. Its hilarious. Bayern are on the attack but listening to the commentator you'd think PSH had had the shot.
Look whoever keeps saying Rashford is better then Mbappe is on crack he has potential to be better then neymar rahsford will be lucky if he reaches rooneys potential lets be honest he has great players around him where mbappe didn’t come from the bottom and worked hard
Psg got lucky
Fantastic coverage
Lukaku more like Donkeykaku lolz
5:33 doesnt make sense
BT Sport > Sky Sport > BBC Sport
Wheres arsenal... oh wait
Chelsea make their Mark
Roma only beat Qarabag 2-1? Very weak score
Fair play chelsea
5:32 audio mixed up???
Higuine
Common chels!!!
Loved Bayern getting raped by Paris
5:33 ...
Haha costa
mBappe 😁😁😁
umtiti and semedo >>
5:40 I'm confused
5:30 lol
Wow Benfica are truly awful
david luiz.. what a liability
Shouldn't the title say 27th instead of 28th? :D
The English teams are improving, so far so good!!!!!!
Anyone know the song name and artist for the song played during the PSG vs Munich Highlights?
liverpool will be the first English team knocked out ...
1:54 Conte's cunting the floor lol
Great to see English teams doing well! I'm envious Arsenal aren't a part of it. What a win by Chelsea, just superb, United looked clinical and City will be tough for anyone to defend against. Good for Spurs too, it's about time their fans enjoyed watching a decent side. Hopefully Liverpool will improve to make it 5/5 in the last 16, Anfield needs more big nights. As for my team, well I'm off to Belarus, should be fun. Would love to see us win the whole thing.
Anyone notice Liverpool's game was not shown. 😂
I love seeing Athletico lose for some reason. Shaping up to be a stacked knockout round this year.
Benfica are nothing without Ederson in goal
Just saying but Lukakus goals were both VERY lucky. Moratas goal was seriously a gem
Jan Oblak??????
get rid of Chris Sutton
Carlo Ancelotti has been Sacked
september 27th - not 26th ------- terrible mistake
Wow I’m over here with stomach pain because of my stomach ulcers  and this video pops up on my feed 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I demand my stomach to build a wall and keep this bacteria out
Don't be afraid to prove some one, something or some belife wrong.
That stomach is a UCKERS
This video is amazing! Thanks and keep bringing content as great as it.
I remember back in February I vomited like 9 times in the matter of 8 hours
I bet you could cure it with drinking bleach.
As an helycobacter pylori user i must say yeah everything is correct
i have never had this.
There are plenty of herbs much better then the antibiotic the medicine has to offer.
Doesn't H pylori cause inflammation by increasing acid levels in the stomach?
Unfortunately many people STILL believe today, in 2017, that stress is the CAUSE (keyword here) of ulcers. You can even read through the comments here and see the people who still fervently defend this notion.\n\nJust a reminder that even if all of the evidence says no, the hubris of people will deny it to satisfy their own ego or desire to be right. This includes scientists.
Can TedEd make a video on diabetes
Why did he drink it to see inside of his stomach . . . couldn't he put the camera down the patients. .. no to simple . . k
I suffer from a stomach ulcer and it sucks! I feel sick all the time plus I cant enjoy any food cuz there is something to always irritate it. blah. The pain is constant but I make it through my day some how!
Being stabbed in the gut is also caused by bacteria, and made worse by stress.\nThis explains why Jamaican food tastes like dirt.
The link between stress and stomach ulcer/acid reflux could be because of reduced Melatonin. There are a number of recent studies showing lowered Melatonin in patients with stomach ulcer and acid reflux. Melatonin has regenerative and protective qualities in Gastrointestinal mucosa in addition to regulating sleep patterns. That could also explain lack of sleep accompanied by these symptoms when stress levels are high. A clear mind allows the body to heal.
Scientists that knowingly put themselves in danger to find answers are quite  some heroes.\nBut I ask myself: Is it ethical?\nWe already know it is unethical to put others in danger (even with their consent) for science.\nBut isn't it as unethical to put oneself in danger for science?\nIs it even legal?\n\nAlso. Is this something a scientist can do to circumvent the unethical act of using test subjects in dangerous experiments?
Nice videos . Get to learn a lot
After my gall bladder removal the Docs pushed the NSAIDS (oral and iv) even after they were told I had issues with them in the past. Eight months later I am still suffering from gastritis, a culture of my inflamed stomach lining revealed NO pylori. NSAIDS interfere with the production of mucous in the stomach and have caused many catactrophic bleeding events. NSAIDS are more dangerous then they are letting on and stronger warnings should be in place.
Oh Jesus, so if I was born a decade earlier & had an ulcer before 2005, I could have needed a surgery. Holy cow..
It will be interested that you explains why h. Pylori can develop in the stomach. Part of that could be stress with lack of production hcl. Without enough hcl , h pylori can develop itself. There is a link beetween this bacteria, stress and immune system! ;)
thanks for making great videos, i learned alot here. nicely done
I wonder  what food or vitamins would you take to increase  your mucosal defense?
he trsusted his guts . pun intended
For science!
I'd say chewing gum
Atatürk?
What does smoking not cause?
You guys are so cool, I really enjoy these lessons !! Keep going! :)
I cant watch this video when the narrator whistles his esses so loud, its a shame unsubscribed
I thought the first thing to do was to use antibiotics.
Big Brother is watching you!
Whether H. pylori is detrimental to health in long term is still not clear. There is a theory that there is a **dynamic equilibrium** acting on our body in which different forces counteract with other. Since H. pylori have existed for such long time in humans stomach, and antibiotics is a recent approach to act against it, we should be able to eliminate them far earlier or suffer from it for a long time, which neither was the case. Given the apparent negative impact of antibiotics, it is highly doubted whether we should use them to eliminate this bacteria...
I see lord of the rings reference, I like.
Could've seen this before my test.
Super informative, well organized script with awesome animation! Great job keep it up!

Herbs are for the healing of the nation. Replace inorganic chemicals with natural herbs then maybe you'll live a few years longer. Herbs cure diseases and Rx Meds reduced your discomfort. It doesn't get rid of it. It's their way to make sure you keep coming back.  I get it though, everyone just wants to make money. Try a Bromide, it's good for your digestive system.  I make it myself. And happy to report that I haven't had any stomach discomfort for quite sometime. I was born with a sensitive digestive system. Everything and Anything would cause discomfort. If you want more info, hit me up.
Guys, check out my latest social experiment 👇\n\nhttps://youtu.be/KF6gRtt9DdA
Definitely gonna show my mom she has no idea why she has ulsers and now she will know!! Yay!! 🙂+😟
Anyone else learning this in health class right now?
Been watching this for 3 minutes. Can't watch anymore what causes it?
I actually had one and at  the time it open, which caused internal bleeding which lead to six months of isolation mixed with pancreatitis caused my transplanted kidney to fail after five years. ESRD came back and here I am 8 years still on dialysis waiting for transplant. :(
I have a question for future videos: How smart are dolphins?

i had ulcer ever since i was 9 now im 11
Titanium dioxide is put in many foods and it will end up in your stomach, these nano particles will act as Trojan Horse that will let bacteria penetrate your stomach lining with ease. I remember using chewing gum after every meal and always having very painful stomach problems, now I know that all chewing gums are full of Titanium nano particles.
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
nice  and Informative video :-)
That don't sound right I ate a lot of spicy food and greasy foods and I developed ulcers because of that, the doctor confirmed it.
Believe me stomach diseases are more dangerous than some life threatening diseases. I have been suffering from IBS-C for last 10 years and at every point of my life it reminds me that I am badly sick. Stress is definitely one of the causes of developing these problems and the issue is that when you have IBS it brings stress with it even if you're doing well in your life it keeps you stressed hence it aggravates the symptoms and this cycle continues. IBS causes stress and stress causes IBS. The worse thing is that there is no cure for IBS in the medical world in 21st century.
You know you have balls of steel when you experiment on yourself. Wowza!
i got rid of my h pylori after 4 years
loved those awkwardly silent solid couple seconds of nothing but fish floating in acid
That abdominal pain is no joke my peeps, if youre suffering from Ulcers I highly recommend you seek help and get treated for it.
This video shows why we should not disregard those scientists who express doubt about Global Warming.  In this medical instance, two lone doctors turned out to be correct when the vast majority of their peers felt confident that those two doctors were clearly wrong to doubt the majority opinion on ulcers.  A new, correct, correct idea is usually discovered by just one or two maverick researchers, and it can take years before the majority of scientists come to accept that new idea.
We all know that ulcers are caused by pregnant ex girlfriends.
healthy Breakfast a day, keeps the ulcers in jail.

So every morning I get a upset stomach and ending up puking up bile or the food I ate before. Could I have a alcer?
I got gastritis but it was because I skipped lunches or breakfasts allot in college to save money..
Someone might gag at this video.
can probiotics kill that bacteria? i heard that it can
I get stomach ulcers when I hear progressives spew words out of their mouths.
1:36 told yaa, bitches!
The AMA is making too much money with the other theories to let on to their patients.
It is really good.
Maybe someone's question is still unanswered. Who knows. But it was helpful to me. Thanks for the video. Will talk to my daughter's GI doctor. At 14 she has been suffering fom acid for several years. Sometimes families need to help the doctor find the answer.
4:20 the DNA chirality is incorrect. It should be right handed, not left.
Good job at illustrating Stomach Ulcer!
Lovely animation
I’ll spicy your food...

Closing in on 1 MILLION subscribers!  Thanks for watching!!\nSupport this weeks charity - https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/mexico-earthquake-relief-fund/\n\nStart Halloween right, come see Nostalgia Critic's new review of IT (2017) on the big screen with cast and crew!\nOct 4th It Review Screening - https://theawesomestore.com/index.php?dispatch=products.view&product_id=29998\nOct 5th It Review Screening - https://theawesomestore.com/index.php?dispatch=products.view&product_id=29999
Can't wait for the new 2020 Green Lantern movie!
Man, what I wouldn't do to go to that It screening..... To bad I live in Australia lmao 
Critic will your it rewiew come on youtube.
I actually enjoy this movie. Don't ask me why. I don't really know, I just do.
Please don't let Malcom play deadpool again. Nearly as bad as xmen origins wolverine
Yikes, the guardians of the universe you mean fetuses
Why didn't you harp about how the guy who became a villain at the end was named Sinestro and the movie treated it like it was a surprise.
If i lived in usa i would go, im sad now
Have you ever considered doing the barbie movies? Maybe make it a month or something? I'd really love to see yall making fun of them lol i grew up with them but i gotta admit their quality is shit
The IT crowd reference!
you should review the land before time series
Seriously Critic, you should've gotten AnimatedJames to be Deadpool in this. He was practically Deadpool' twin when he did a live reaction of EG: Legend of Everfree.
Wait, is the professor played by Stan from the original IT?
I havent seen this film but it was pretty strange to listen to you critisise the CGI when it actually looks pretty high-budget and realistic.
That ending with devil boner and hyper fan girl was strangely cute.\nI loved it.
I think Nostalgia Critic hit on why Deadpool can only ever be on the sideshow
Man, it would be awesome to see it. but you know,  Brazil to LA is a big distance ):
I like how they make fun of the dead pool movie.
Green lantern and use your willpower\n\n\nor black lantern and bring back dead Batman
Green Lantern movie is a pile of shit! 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
I wonder if you guys will ever make a 1987 transformers movie vid I would love it but I doubt it will happen
HEy NOSTALGIA CRITIC. WHY do the parodist Deadpool say the same jokes as Deadpool, but they look like a stupit gyes? why? WHY? WHY? Because Deadpool's film is bad and stupid.
That feel when you think of a movie as somewhat recent, then it comes on a Nostalgia channel.
Half of me actually likes how self aware this movie can be at times... It's like it recognizes how bad it is and just doesn't care... But only for a moment at a time so it doesn't really help.
is nostalgia gonna release the it review on youtube after its release?
First superhero movie I ever saw
Hey nostalgia critic, at what point will you review your own old reviews? You're on season ten.
Cringe is all over me
fuck man i wont be able to be there man this sucks.review was awesome tho
When are you gonna review IT on YouTube
19:08 the sad thing is sky high made more money and has better effects then this film
I wanna see your screening Channel Awesome but I live in Canada!😭 I'm going to cry now
I wanna see your review on the big screen but I live in Australia and don't have a passport :( 🙁
Just some suggestions I just wanted to throw out there using quotes that the characters say to best summarize what lies ahead for the Critic (Reply if you know what they are):\nMy grandfather is dead.\nAre you like a crazy person?\nDo the thing!
I watched this in an advace screening in a teather full of fans, guys in costumes an all, and I remember how, when the movie ended, there was just a sad silence. Normally, no matter how bad or mediocre there is some kind of cheer or applause. Not this time.
Wouldn’t it‘d been awesome if Doug actually got Ryan Reynolds for this?
The Green Lantern Corps is a rip-off of E.E. Doc Smith's 'Lensmen' series, galactic policemen with superpowers granted by the Galactic Lens.
It's a sad commentary on movie making when Nostalgia Critic is better at telling the story than the people who were given millions of dollars to make the movie!  HOLY *BOBBY THE BRAIN HEENAN* , SPORTS FANS, this is messed up!
i  know you dont do tv series, but if you do, please sin ghost whisperer. and just to make it easier i have listed 5 things i hate about the series.\n \n1- the main character (melinda). the biggest cry baby, for a tough character she sure cries alot. i swear if i had a dollar for every episodes she cried i'd be a millionaire by now. i mean she meets dead people all the time she should get used to it by now. she is always the center of attention, her ghosts are more important than anyone else, yes that bothers me to no end. and call me a feminist or whatever, but having her showing her cleavage in EVERY.SINGLE.EPISODE. can get very distracting, very annoying very fast. i mean if that's what it takes to get ratings then that is just pathetic. i swear most of the time she goes to work in her night gown i can see her cleavage. what also annoys me is that she keeps talking in that whispering-about to faint voice. speaking of fainting, she does that alot, just asking for more attention.\n\n2-  (jim) the husband. i feel like the show made up a fantasy fictional husband that just wont work in real life. that's jim. he cooks, he cleans and melinda on the other hand wakes up at 3 am night to go search for her ghosts in the streets while leaving her husband to worry. she does that like more than once. there is an episode where she gets stuck inside a cave and jim has to look for her and when he finds her she bursts out crying like a fucking baby that she is and he just calms her down. now if that was in real life he'd be yelling at her not to run off in the middle of the night like a lunatic. or he could just divorce her on the spot. he told her many times that these ghost business should wait because he wants to spend more time with her but she is like nope, the ghosts are no.1. accept me for who i am. fucking selfish hoebag. i never saw this woman do any wife duties. i never saw her cook or clean, its always the husband. and before anyone jumps in again and says i am sexist, jim works in the paramedic and was a firefighter before. he runs around saving people. both his jobs puts huge muscle strain on him. yet we see him at home cooking like he wasnt even tired at all. in real life husbands would just remove their shoes and fall on the couch sleeping. all melinda does is stand in one spot selling or running off leaving the work to someone else while she chases her ghosts or drinks coffee. there are many times he rings her to see if she is ok and she is like sorry jim then hangs up. one time her husband told her off becasue it got too dangerous but she yelled at him saying stuff like don't tell me what to do i've got to save those ghosts!. and when he wanted to become a doctor and study outside of grandview (he was also trying to get her to stay away from danger), but she snapped at him saying what about me and my life and my store. she is fucking selfish. she is a bad wife. period.\n\n3- all fathers are bad, all mothers are saints. there are many times were some ghost fathers who did wrong but they arent bad themselves, but melinda treats them like criminals because she keeps seeing her father in them. for a gift like that she sure knows how to abuse it and the ghosts. there is even one episode in christmas, where the a father was talking to his ex-wife about her affair with another man and the son might not be his, the wife snapped at him saying i cant believe you'd actually do a paternity test!. well, it's HIS FUCKING RIGHT TO KNOW IF HIS SON IS HIS OR NOT. fucking whore. and i swear to god, i knew i saw it coming, he receives the test results by mail and melinda ACTUALLY convinces him to accept his child even if it's not his because it christmas the season of forgiving. and he tears the letter! i literally screamed at the tv and hit my fist so hard it hurt. in what justice do you treat your husband like that? the wife goes fucking around and then carries a bastard that has a huge risk its not the father and the father has to forgive the wife??!! NO FUCK THAT YOU FUCKING WHORE. FUCK YOU MELINDA. and also the episode where the college teacher payne knew his ghost wife was cheating with someone else and melinda AGAIN asks him to forgive his wife just so she could go to the light but he refuses (having every right to do so) but the ghost just backfires at him. \n\n4- everyone in grandview is rude. i dont know why they do that. is it to scare me not to visit grandview or just to make melinda look more like an angel? but i have seen this more than once. every one she meets and their first words to her are who are you? what do you want? excuse me? they all look at her antagonizingly. there is even one episode where she wants to sells some stuff and the receptionist looks at her from bottom to top with the biggest attitude i've ever seen. and its not like she meets her again, no, this is like a one time encounter in the whole freakin series. it makes no sense and it makes me NOT want to live in grandview.\n\n5- there is no judgment, everyone goes to the light. yes including killers, rapists, wrongdoers, whores, liars, thieves, criminals, kidnappers, Sociopaths etc.\n\ni'd rather watch supernatural than this crap
20:19 - 21:06\n\nYou know what's even worse about Parallax's effects, is that THE F***ING TOY THAT PROMOTED THE MOVIE based on him looks more realistic!\n\nNo seriously, he's was creepy, he looked more true to the comics while still looking new, AND like the comics he looked like a living radioactive explosion!\nhttps://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oyPBOYj8L._SL1300_.jpg\n\nIt's pretty bad when you realize the toy company could've made a more accurate Green Lantern movie than this.
I thought Critic already did a review of this?
Not even gonna mention how the geeky guy is Taika Waititi? You know, the famous New Zealand comedy director? Making the new Thor movie? Anything? No? Well... okay then.
My short review of this video and channel.\nI didn't laugh, I wasn't entertaint and  I wasn't surprised.\nOf late this channel's videos have been very repetitive in how he/they review movies and do jokes. \nIt just seems forced and unauthentic.. . I know he is doing a character and thats how he reacts to bad movies, but i don't find it funny or fitting for ALL reviews..\nI dont know.. Maybe it's just me who wants a reviewer to be more easy going and only have the movie-actors acting bad and silly
Move To Google And Type: *gamesecrxguide facebook* It is going to be the purely working facebook secret working from this month. Please don't waste the available free time on other methods
Think Doug would ever review the 2016 movie Mamaboy?
I think a great nostalgia-ween episode would be tremors.
DeathBattle: Deadpool vs. Pinkie Pie.  That's what you're missing, Doug.
Do a wrong turn review
18:18 who the hell was that?
A friend of mine is a huge fan of Green Lantern so when he heard this movie was coming out he wouldn't stop taking about, after he saw it he never talked about it again. Also congrats Devil Boner and Hyper Fan Girl.
try Green Lantern: Emerald Knights is bettter that this movie
Unpopular opinion; Green Lantern's special effects don't actually look that bad, I actually liked the colour work of the film and a lot of the shot composition, I thought Reynolds was halfway entertaining to watch despite the uninspired plot and Mark Strong was a pretty great Sinestro. People act like this movie was Catwoman or Elektra or any Batman movie before the Nolan Trilogy but it's problem isn't that the CG was bad (it really, really isn't), it's just that it's a 6/10 movie. I mean, Green Lantern was at least more memorable than Thor 2, every Hulk movie, any superhero film with a female lead before Wonder Woman (I've heard Tank Girl is good but I haven't watched it myself). Honestly Critic's over the top hate for the film annoyed me more than anything else, since he usually comes off as the voice of reason in the sea of cynical shit that is the internet.
Maybe if you actually wrote Deadpool like Deadpool, he'd be funny.
I hope people in Mexico are alright. A friend of mine has family in Mexico and I'm praying that they are okay. Btw, good review critic
Review Yu-Gi-Oh Dark Side of Dimension movie Nostalgia Critic
It Old v. New when?!
I remember being so hyped for this movie but in the end it was a turd. I remember this came out two weeks after X-Men: First Class. I wasn't especially excited for that movie because the last X-Men prequel was also a turd though First Class was directed by the same bloke who made Kick-Ass so I was a little hopeful and it turned out to be really good and the best superhero flick of 2011 along with Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger.
It's an amazing how unappealing this film is Lmao classic
Doug looks more and more like Maynard James Keenan every time I see him...
I didn't love this movie but I didn't despise it. Theres some bad CGI and writing but some of the scenes are decent enough. I loved Reynolds as Hal though, I thought he did a great job with what he had. I'd love to see him in another Green Lantern film...with a different writing crew and director. He would kill as a green lantern if given the opportunity to do it right. Can you imagine Reynolds nailing not only one comic book hero but two?
Oddly enough, the spin off Animated Show: Green Lantern TAS is 1000x better quality and was only canceled because the movie tanked. Seriously, go watch it.
Can you please do a review of Kingdom hearts? That would be cool! I also love this video bye the way! 👍👍👍

woaaaaah how much did it cost to get the REAL ryan reynolds to help with this review?!?!?!?!?!
He really redefines the meaning of the word nostalgia
Loved the I.T Crowd reference.
Honestly I’m somewhat shocked you didn’t get Ryan Reynolds to work with you on this.  Hard to believe he’d miss an opportunity to rip apart his second most hated role.
The alein ring summons him? In every other GOOD telling the ring goes to find him! THAT WAS SO STUPID!!
That generic nerd character...\n\nOh look its NOT David Ayoade.
That really came out in 2011? Feels so much longer.
Like for the IT Crowd and Good Burger reference, you smashed it Nostalgia critic!!!!! XD 😂😂😂😂
Hey, Critic! If you want real nostalgia, and a burning need for some REALLY strong liquor to get you through a video, try a review of Kiss Meets The Phantom of the Park. It's so bad, it's comical.
Say what you want about this shitty movie. But the introduction was not bad..
I was about to watch this film. Thank gosh I watched this to know how bad the film is.
I was invited to devil boner's and hyper fan Girl's wedding!

This video made me fall more in love with Zac Efron ♥
Amazing actor, I like how he is just an normal guy but we see him as a star because he worked hard and long for his title. One side we see him as normal an then again he can have a adventurous side . I'd like to thank Zac Efron for letting the whole world get to know him better as a person then a star.

An early lesson in expectations.
Woah did she just assume the gender of that unborn baby?
but there are 76 genders, how do you know its a boy
Sexist bitch
*British crying*
Don't feed her too many candies.
Talk about a perfect accidental commentary on modern day society.
I thought this was very cute until I realized that his is her typical behavior she has adapted to, in order to earn blue sweeties. =(
Cuteness overload! God bless you all!

Fuck, people dumb enough to still film vertically squeezing more out.
Comment section these days is cancer! Such negativity on a little girl? see how cute and innocent she is. 💕
Well all I'm gonna say is this isn't really that cute at all. Any child of this age that I know who's found out the sex of their baby siblings never cried over wanting a sibling of the same gender. I never did either. Looks to me this girl seems quite spoilt. Of course she's just a kid at the end of the day though, and I'm pretty certain she'll love her little brother once he arrives.
Waaaay tooo many disgusting people here in the coments. You should feel ashamed!
No offense but she is rude I love my baby sister to bits yes I was expecting a brother but so what about gender she is cute no matter what that girl is spoilt mum needs tell her that her brother will be sad if she dont love him! Rude child. Idc if shes 3 she should know
lol stupid children
so funny when grownup neo-feminists act like exactly the same way sometimes
I agree with this little girl 100%.   It is a completely valid opinion.
So sweet! saw her on the Wendy Williams Show!Adorableness
my little too when she he a him.
Fake tears, the parents have taught her to be this way through poor reinforcement. She cries, then gets rewarded with candy. Unsurprisingly, her tears end immediately.
He\n He\n  He\nShe's funny.
Siobhan, turn off the comments. They're saying awful things about your children. Just turn them off!
Start saving and you can pay for his surgery, little girl.
This wouldn't happen in China. It would be more like Good news! We're having a boy so we don't have to infanticide your new sibling like we almost did with you.
you know what this video really means. the boys are her school are not very nice to her
That boy is going to be tortured for at least the first 10 years of his life.
I had a british older sister, she was mean and didn't want me either lmao
It boggles my mind why parents like this are so eager to share their shitty parenting with the rest of the world.
I wouldn't leave her alone in the room with the new baby, just sayin
Hi Siobhan I work for @DailyBlasLive! We would love to use this adorable video please email me at alexie.pincus@dailyblastlive.com
Hopefully her brother realizes he is a she and gets HRT therapy before she can walk.
Good luck with all that, little guy.
Guuuuul
that is one ugly kid
Sexist toddler! haha xD
What a cutie :)

Thanks for reminding me why I don't have kids.
Feminism already corrupting the youth smh tbh fam
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Rémes ez a gyerek még szerencse,hogy a következő fiú talán az nem lesz ilyen hisztis...
Lesbian feminist in the making.
She needs to step away from the Pop Tarts from time to time, methinks.
Tell her the baby boy is trans and can dress her up like a girl.
My parents did the same thing when my sister was going to be born. I still wish she was a boy...
Your kid is dumb
Brat
I know this is British, but can any of you Brits tell me what area this accent is attributed to?
I came for the comments and I am not disappointed.
get rid of the little cunt, i mean the alive one BTW
just cut off his penis
I'd grab that little fucker and shake her violently. Then sell her to my friend Jeremy Epstein. John Posestda will pay top dollar too
*Did you just assume that baby's gender what the fuck you are literally hitler I am calling CPS right now prepare to have your life ruined and your family torn apart!!!!!!!!!!!!!*
making the sex of an unborn crucial\nvertical video\nboy's and girl's color\nbribing with sweets
Beggars can’t be choosers
Cheer up, little one! These days, newborns get to choose their gender! So, they just might end up being a girl after all!\nHopefully your tax funded public school administration will get the gender situation sorted out early on by Pre-K! Good luck!
What a brat. You can tell the kid uses crying to get what she wants. And these parents videotape as if it's amusing. Just wait 10 years.
dumb cunt dont sideways film u dumb whore and beat ur ugly ass kid. dont ever let them talk back like its nothing dumb whore
fucking annoying little kid
www.reddit.com sent me here and oh my god im glad i dont have a fuckin annoying girl like that as my kid the parents are obviously pussy liberals for letting this happen my sister would have never acted like that because my parents believed in spanking not being a pussy parent who gives trophys for everything
THAT LITTLE GIRL IS JUST LIKE THE REDDIT COMMUNITY, CRYING OVER SOME STUPID SHIT, AND UPSET THAT THEY CANT GET THEIR WAY. POOR BABIES
If you think she's being mean, let me tell you that I stepped on my brother's throat after he was born because I wanted to be an only child. (He's fine, i didn't press my foot too hard. My parents saw and stopped me). I also tried to strangle him on several occasions and there's even a picture of it
You gotta show this on her wedding day..
I really felt her pain; that was so sad :(  Saddest thing ever.  never watching this type of stuff again its horrible.
Hi, I'm Ivana from Rumble.com. We are interested at featuring your amazing video on our site. Please email me at ivana@rumble.com for more info. Thanks!
Awww, my cat was called Daisy before she died last year. If I ever have a little girl I want their name or middle name to be flower related as I was so close to her. X
I am Izabella but my name has always been shortened to Bella :) I am not a fan of Izzy myself :D
I love a lot of these names but mine are \nCharlotte Lilly \nElizabeth- bf mum called that so I can't :(\nLove Jane Marrie \nRosie \nBoys \nI love\nJames\nHarry \nLuke Joshua \nMicah \nToby \nAdam - bf called that \nI'm so excited to have a baby although it will probably be a couple years
My name is Isabella and I get called Issie but that is because there is 4 other Isabella's in my year but so many people called me Isabelle and it gets me so pissed
This has a couple of my fav names - I've loved autumn since I was young
I know a beautiful little girl called Autumn with gingery auburn hair. If that makes your day :)
Loved seeing another video of this Gabbie. 😊❤
I've always liked the names James (after Paul McCartney), Martha and Olga for babies. But I prefer thinking of kitten names myself😂
Sky from mama mia is a babe 😍
Nothing wrong with the name issy, just saying...
Teddy is on my list too !
Lol I’m in the same class as Claudia Winkleman’s daughter so I always meet Claudia winkleman! ❤️
Full name Idea Nova daisy meaning New day
Is this her hint of saying she's pregnant?? 🤰
Are you still wanting to change your name? Xx
Your make up is goals!
I love the name Claudelle or Evie or Summer or Rosie or Lowen for girls (also love autumn too) for boys I love Charlie (and for a girl too) and James and Noah and Casey and Evan and Nico!!!
We have a horse named Nova! It's because she was born in November 😊 \nShe is so unique and gorgeous so I think it's become super perfect.
If you like bohdi but it’s not European enough. How about Brodie? That’s very similar. Love you 💜
I love your eyeshadow in this video 😊
In Ireland griffin is a second name 😂
What app is it that you use for your cover photos?? Just got myself an iPad Pro 😁
Summer will be her top 3
When you put the girls names in pink I was like, hmmm I wonder how much shit she would get if she put the boys names in blue! I don't want children, but if I did I'd only want boys lol: Finn, Rory & Elisha! You should have a look into Jewish/Hebrew names Gabs, there's some lovely names that I've never really come across.
i never comment but you look so beautiful and stylish !
Daisy is now on my list lol
When I heard Blair, I thought of two things. Tony Blair and The Blair Witch Project.\n\nSorry Gabby! 😂
I LOVE THE NAME VIENNA
When you pronounced Hudson, it sounded like Hoodson. I had to read the name on the screen. When you said shorten it to Hud, it sounds like Hood. I love accents. 🙂 Out of curiosity, how do the English pronounce hood? Is hud and hood pronounced the same?
I really like the names Essi and Autumn xx
my name is amber and my second name is Nova and my whole life I went by the name Nova and I've never heard anyone else with the name nova😊
You look gorgeous omg 😍
What eyeliner are you using in your waterline? & does it actually stay put and smudge proof all day? Ps love this look & vid!❤
I personally love the name Izzy but I know loads of people that call me Isobel because they don't like the shortened version 🤷🏻‍♀️
My name is Isabella 
My best friend is called Isabella no one ever calls her Bella or izzy because she hates being called anything but Isabella
I love the name Aprillll
Love you so much 💜 also I love Vienna, def putting that on my potential baby names list
Just for the record I've known about 4 people named Autumn and yes it is such a nice name!
My name was featured in this hahaha! Daisy is weird because it's kind of common but then again I don't actually know many other Daisy's. This is so funny as my dog is called Teddy Edward and I actually know a girl called Autumn with strawberry blonde hair! Such a coincidence. Love this video as always Gab and all of the names you have such a cool and different taste✨🌹
vienna is my #1 😭 a mum once called out to her gorgeous little daughter in the hairdresser saying “vienna” and i fell in love, it’s so beautiful
My nephews called Hudson and I definitely agree about it being American sounding but his brothers are called Lennon & Jaxon so they go well together
Sky is a beautifullll boys name but nobody has ever agreed with me😂 reminds me of mamma Mia aha
Oh my gosh Gabs you are glowing!! I want to come round to yours so you can do my makeup this beautiful haha ❤️
I love the boy name Clay 😊
Me and my cousin Isabella were able to choose my baby cousins name so we called her Gabriella Claudia! 💗
You remind me of poppy deyes so much 😮
Hi Gabbie I've got a great video idea for you I've snapped you it it's a pll tag and it's so fun and I'd love you to do it  it has so many questions that I'd love to know as Ik your a big pll fan like me xx ps Ly❤️❤️
I know someone called Autumn!!
Aww one of my best friends is called Liesel xxx
My sisters middle name is nova
Liesel sounds too much like weasel for me. But love all the other names you talked about! I too love the sound of music!
I have a niece named Izabella. We call her Bella
Also I hope this isn't too random, but I really think Desirae is such a nice name ^_^ xxxx
Love this video Gab!! At my work placement there is a girl called Autumn and she's so cute!! Loving the darker hair, it looks so good on you and it suits you so much, love you always!! Xx
Oh my god my childhood teddy was called Teddy Edward 😂😂😂
Love the names you love omg !! Sky is my favourite boy name, reminds me of Sophie’s fiancé in Mamma Mia the movie 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
My friends called autumn and her brother is called archer. Feel like you may have a similar asthetic to her mum 😁
Your hair looks so healthy and shinny, woah!! I'm thinking of dying it darker as well, love it😍 Out of all the names you said in the video, I love Blair, Nova, Daisy and Vienna, I would probably use Vienna too!
my parents let me name my cat when I was 8 and I named him tedward 😂
Ok so when you said Monica I thought that Isabella would be a good first name with Monica in the middle... Then you mentioned Isabella literally five seconds later 😱
Omggg I’m called Viana but it’s pronounced Vienna 💗 love you soo much
I’ve got a nephew called teddy xx
Not even pregnant but I know that I'm calling my first daughter Skye
Me and my brother both have four letter names because my parents didn't want us to have nicknames which hasn't worked 😂 Esme-Ezz and Toby-Tobs 😊
Hope your feeling better x
Love Autumn and Vienna ❤️ xx
I watch the sound of music with my nana, and we have bonded so much over that c
I absolutely adore the name Freddie for a girl 😍 my cousin has a friend called that and I think it's just gorgeous 😍😍
My surname is HUDSON!!!!!!!!x
nooo way!! i call my dog teddy edward x
My auntie is called Monica and her daughter is called Claudia 😘
I love the name Vienna but it's far too similar to my name❤️😭 ( Sienna)
i bloody love your dark hair! it suits you so much what the heck!!! love you xx
I love the French name Ninon so much but of course my sister decided to call her daughter Nina so my husband now doesn't like the fact that there will be a Nina and a Ninon in the family 😂 otherwise I love Stella and Emilia.
lol I hate it so much when people call me Izzy its such a rank nickname I don't mind Bella though
My sisters are called Claudia, Gabriella and I'm Isabella 😂❤
glad I'm not the only person who likes the name Autumn love it :)
My name is Monika and I hated it almost all my life. Now Imm 29 and I actually quite like it. Maby because I feel this name is more unique in Scotland where I live than in Poland where I come from.
I'm called Kate, but I noticed how you said you can't shorten it, and for me that's true however every single teacher decides to call me Katie and It annoys me sooo much x love u gabby
Two things: 1. You look gorgeous here. You always look gorgeous obviously but I am loving the eye look & your hair length. 2. Great idea for a video!! I've always had a long list of baby names on my phone...I mean I've had one since college which was like 8 years ago 😂😂. Thought I was the only single girl with a list of baby names haha. Ok a couple of my favorites for a girl are Nora and Holland. For a boy I love Rafe and Mac.

Hag
WOW!!!!!
+1 like for chickens
What Ryobi doesnt have a shopvac?
Damn looks legit man
Amazing !!!
This was awesome good job
His buddy was freaking ripped
Beautiful workshop build, gentlemen!!!!!
Damn those chickens! :)
Amazing!
Solar powered chicken coop is next
nice
Super workshop!
Really cool
Wy wiht
Awesome
Super workshop, thanks.
Nice project
nice build. well done..
Ryobi much?
The best Ryobi commercial ever.
Super!
That was great!
Beer fridge?
Incredible!!!!!!
Very cool
Ryobi sponsored?
Get a Home-Depot Bucket, get some plastic bags= Instant Potable Toilet :)
Nice Build.
Wow! You're great!
klass
All white painted workshop, riiiiiiiiight !
I LOVE how this turned out! We're definitely keeping this build in mind when it comes time to build an outdoor office space - thanks for sharing!
Now I want one
Ryobi?!  Please tell me you're sponsored by them.  I can forgive that.  Good video.
I love this finally real deal w step by step thank You much love a solution to having power at the back of the property for cutting back wood sucker trees
Well done! Where are the batteries from?
Where is link to podcast  interview w/ Jason regarding solar power?  You mentioned this around 5:45
Looks nice and like the solar idea. In my opinion having a shop at home . White interior will be difficult to keep clean.
Very inspiring, keep it going.\n\nLove it!
And I notice that there are free range chickens in this video.
I guess the only issue is getting enough power to handle a light welder. Otherwise it pretty awesome.
So can I  borrow ALL the people who helped you build yours?😊😉
12:53 - Amazing shed, but looks like you had to settle for a cheap Pabst after spending so much on the shed.
All that sand, gravel, tamping .. seems like a waste?  since installers propped it up on 8 shimmed pads around the outside edge .. the gravel there will wash out over time and/or ground will heave.  Some 3' post holes and 4x4 pressure treated posts would last for decades, and remain level .. and eliminated the ugly shim pads.
first time i watch one of your videos but it's really great I'll check out what else you got on your channel
Great video , and nice work ! Going to share this video\nWith all my buddies ! thanks
Awesome!! I love the wall storage system! Looks better than standard pegboard for the large things! Nice work!
I want this so bad!!!!!
Wouldn't it be better to charge the batteries before the inverter so it doesn't have two times the loss when changed to AC than back to DC  for charging again?
About the ground rod: you can protect it using a piece of pvc tube with cape to be a little prettier and safe
Lots of great ideas!!
its nice to see that your chickens help you pack down the dirt
Awesome!!! Please do more videos like this one!!
how to build the second storage with such material when first story is built on solid concrete??
Love your work! Do you need any assistant? Please let me know.
Great video, the editing and narrative was amazing and the project was awesome
Did anyone else catch the brand of all the tools and lawn equipment? Don't recall it being mentioned.
Need this to get away from my wife. A foldable bed off the wall and im sold
I enjoyed your commercial. Now off to home Depot and buy some Ryobi products.
OK I'm sitting down how much did this cost in total
Those dirty hand tools are going to rust out there.
this video is so satisfying :) i didnt fast forward a single time!!!
Wow i Love it! Subscribing now!
This video was AMAZING! tks for the content! This channel is GREAT!
Without insulation that is going to be too cold in winter and too hot in summer.
Should have added a vacuum air duct system. Good build tho so jealous
Everything was from home depot  even the tools was this sponsored?
good Idea BUT as its a SPONSORED video The cost outways the build or Ideas unless youve got the Cash
My dad built a shed that big for £500-£1000 out of wood, but he could have easily used metal.
I wish car bodies were solar panels. I'd have the sweetest mini shop on wheels.
Thats a lot of white!
good job your a good brother
I'm curious to see how long the floor stays white 🤔 I'd have green streaks from lawnmower within a few weeks 😉
I'm pretty sure he is sponsored by the home depot as everything is from them.... Literally everything.... I work there and he has all our products.... Ryobi is great tho
You forgot the this video contains a paid promotion tag.
This is mind blowing, I would love to get a job done like this
Loved this. I would love to try making something like this myself.
Really good project, cant wait for next big project
DO MORE also tell Home Depot to come to uk we only have b and q
Wow that was awesome! Good job! Thanks for sharing!
You should add wind power
Wow how much did this build cost?
I'd love to see a garage with a garage door opener as well as what you've already done!  AWESOME!
I am flying into space
a wild mike montgomery appeared!
Simply Amazing, you just got yourself a new subscriber 👍🏻
You need a cnc router in there
Incredible! I'd love to have a workshop like that - time to check our building codes!
Alternating current/direct current = ac/dc (incase people wonder where their name comes from)
All I can say is amazing!!!!
it seems like solar panels will be exposed to sun only half of a light day.\nflat roof or 90 degree turn of a shed would make whole thing more effective.
Thank you it's been very helpful and good luck.
Surprised you didn't mention the brand of the paint as well as the other advertisement products.
Why do you only own ryobi tools?
I specialize in making and showing how to lay wigs down to look natural. You shouldn’t have to pull any of your natural hair out while wearing Freedom wigs. And also make sure there is a elastic band sewn in so it for snug to the head. Lastly do two braids to the back of your head and pin them. And if you use stocking cap pull it back away from hairline so you don’t see it in the front. Hope this helps ladies. Also here is my video 😉 https://youtu.be/8BzfjSc1RNs
Pia looks like the sweetest girl 😍
they struggling
Please do another one PLZZZ
Want a wig now lol 😂💞
https://youtu.be/dNR6Aj9O_ks
LIKE BEFORE WATCH CLUB 😂❤️
Two of my faves 🙌
chloe you are sooooooo pretty
wigs r disgusting
Didn't know white women wore lacefront wigs
Omg chloe yours looking so goood 😍😍😍 love it soo much ❤️👑 #flawless 🙌🏽
loved this x
Beautiful 🖤💜💛💕💖💔
You can sew the lace under so you don't have to cut it :)
Lol.. I bought a $1700 wig from freedom couture and didn't even get a wig cap with it. Beauty bloggers getting more treatment? Hm yeah
I ordered one and it didn't fit on my head!! It was so small and they told me it was a large! The company are really vague with details.
If you don't want that wig , I'll take it
Also there are usually clips on the inside to help keep the side down.. but look up  got 2 be glued method
I’m surprised no blow torch was brought out 😂
Chloe, If u hate them, I have alopecia and can only leave my house with a wig on. I will gladly take them off your hands 😬🙏🏻
hey everyone! I just wrote a simple blog post on how to eat organically to lose weight and stay healthy. Please support <3 \nhttps://thehealthynewyorker.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/delicious-organic-healthy-breakfast-ideas/
You guys are both beautiful!!!!
You guys need to join Wig Skaters group on Facebook. $1500 is way to much for a wig
You get your foundation then flip the wigs and place it on the lace. Braid you real hair to lay flat then use gots to be glued to keep the wig Down or you can sew the wig on
I'm a black woman and those wigs looks so natural but 1500 dollars might as well should of tried clip in extensions would of saved some money!!!
I'm a guy and even i found this funny to watch.
Pia looks like Nina dobrev at certain angles with that wig on!!!
As a straight male I watched this to learn for my girlfriend. That is all.
Those wigs are amazing, you guys just don't know how to put them on but it was really funny 😂😂 do more vids together! Maybe watch some black YouTubers, they know the best wig techniques
This was such a funny and fresh video! Thank you Chloe, nice meeting you Pia! By the way you look Really good with that dark colored wig. I suggest you also check Jackie Aina's video on how to install the wigs. Blessings from Mexico 🇲🇽
😂😂😂😂 and they  1500 each
This is hilarious 😂😂😂😂
Really helpful!!!! https://youtu.be/dNR6Aj9O_ks
Check that guys http://www.yves-rocher.fr/?shopId=AFF&chn=affiliation&src=zanox&cm_mmc=AFF-_-261391-_-625697-_-default&awc=6958_1506904726_0c051374bf652da67131f7122ef4b76f
You need wig glue :)
pia's makeup😍😍😍😍😍
Watch the Jackie Aina tutorial!
Yeaak
2 beautiful ladies ❤️❤️
Am I the only one that thinks that at some angels Pia looks like Jennifer Lawrence?
You are so funny
Holy shit, you spent $3000 on wigs she will never wear. Crazy!
That was Horrible! ! Hahaha
you guys should collab more
you also have to put make underneath the lace in order to make it more like scalp jajaja its also called bleaching the knots or hiding the knotsss
From far away and on their Instagram account they made it look so easy and so pretty and natural af but in real life you can see everything
How you cut and apply a wig depends on what you’re wearing it for. For everyday kind of use, you just trim back the lace as close to the baby hairs as you can. You secure the wig down by having a wig cap on, and using bobby pins to secure it in place. Under the wig cap you can do multiple things. You can do a wrap, you can do pin curls, you can do anything that holds the hair flat and gives your natural hair some shape or texture for the pins you put through the wig to grip on to. For stage, you’d leave the lace long (with repeated use the lace gets shitty and you have to trim it back. Eventually you run out of lace and you have to get it replaced) and use adhesive to stick the lace down around the face. Never put adhesive in the hair because that just ruins it. Sometimes the wigs natural hairline doesn’t match your own so you just kind of have to fiddle with it and find a way to disguise any lace that stands out. You can use makeup to cover it too
😝
Pia looks like jhene aiko here
ladies if you buy a wig that expensive you need to get one with bleached knots so you cant tell its lace.
Use Bobby pins for the sides but other then that looks good keep on trying 😄
As a black woman who occasionally wears lace front wigs, I agree - when I watched tutorials as a beginner, I realized there are SO MANY STEPS MISSING!! And omg she really used double-sided tape lmbooo poor thing, I'm dying!! lol I recommend getting some wig glue or toupee tape instead of regular double-sided tape (which will shine through). Also, for people with fair skin the lace should be bleached, so it's transparent. The lace on these wigs was like, light brown/tan lol tooo visible for their skin tone... hope it works out better next time :)
Maybe if you learnt the proper application it would look more natural ❤️
Yes I'm so happy, I love pia!!!!! :)
بحبك كتير وبعشق فديوهاتك im from syria
I want the long wig!
You didn’t put it on right but u did u just missed it a bit
What does an Australian accent sound like to an English woman vice versa?
I'm so picky with wigs like I can't stand fake looking ones but the ones I want like these are too expensive
Hey Chloe look up freedom couture hair on YouTube she has heaps of tips and tricks! X
Omggg you turn the wig inside out and put your own power foundation on the lace parts
Check out Blondielocks here on you tube.  She is the best at explaining wigs from what to buy, styling a wig and how to make it look less 'wiggy' looking!!
Pia's arms are ripped !!! I wish mine looked like that.
The struggle is real! :) I totally understand the confusion. I was clueless when I started wearing wigs years ago. I am still trying to master the lace game! :)
What do I do about that?\nYeah, see, idk... \nMMMMMMEEEEE giving advice
Gross waste of money. Why people support this company I'll never know.
It's better brown on pia
It takes practice just like everything else in life. I think you both look awesome and can master the wigs.
I love how you just casually got freedom couture wigs, I'd give an arm for one, losing all my hair :(
I cant believe they wasted 1500 dollars just to fuck it up.
Chloe -- do a video using only products that don't test on animals please.  It would be such a great boost for these companies and you don't have to put down any other company -- just highlight the ones that don't test. Thanks! <3
I totally understand your frustration!! esp with the sides!!! i have a wig that i never use because the lace on the sides is always showing.....and i can never manage to conceal the lace in front either? :(
Chloe check out this youtuber's tutorial on wig application\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDLCu-8DXsE
I've been married 16 years. I have a pretty good wife though we've had our problems. Here's why I don't recommend marriage for unmarried men now:\nFirst, the stakes are incredibly high. The risk of failure is too high, unacceptably high. The odds of finding a suitable partner who can and will actually be in it for the long haul are too low.\n\nSecond, marriage for a man means mostly taking on duties and obligations. The offer was sweetened because in exchange for his taking on those obligations, the prospective husband was traditionally promised one real, valuable benefit: Good, regular sex at reasonable intervals with a reasonably attractive women, all with a minimum of effort. But even that's not guaranteed now because many wives do not consider they have any obligation to have sex with their husbands and feel justified in withholding sex for the flimsiest of reasons or no reason at all. And besides, a man who wants sex in this time need not marry to get it. All he needs is either (1) minimal game competence; or (2) money for prostitutes.\n\nSo, if he can't even get some minimal guarantee of the one benefit he's supposed to get out of the deal, why should he even try to make the deal in the first place?\n\nSorry this betrays some of my Christian beliefs. I'm just stating realities on the ground.\n\nWhile women certainly do have feelings, and they sometimes use the word 'love' to describe it- It depends on how we define love.... is it a passionate moment of powerful feeling... or is it a lifetime of commitment and sacrifice?
Stick with the Jon Renau, and Raquel Welch wigs. The lace front in these wigs are very realistic, no cutting lace as it's already cut.\nGet hand tied as they're much better quality.
Oh Chloe! Jackie Aina has a wonderful video on this: https://youtu.be/uDLCu-8DXsE
as a every day wig user this is a huge fail to me but it totally shows that just buying an expensive wig doesn't mean it will look bomb (which is a common mistake ) so thanks
To get rid of the spotty look you have to put powder foundation under the lace to help cancel out the dark lace roots. Try it next time, that should help. Also, you can cut the part around your ear to contour to the natural curve of your head. So don't be afraid to cut some lace and hair around your ears.
Chloe is so beautiful omg💓
Girl just chop all that lace off!!! God I just wanted to jump thru the screen and help!😂 watch Nikita Draguns video on how she applies her wigs! It's bomb 🔥
It is quite dissapointing how noticable the lace is on a freedom couture wig.  I was going to save up money for one but the mesh is very spaced out and seems thick, and for that expensive of a wig, you expect to look more natural and seamless. Ive bought 300 dollar wigs with better up close lace than that.  There are ways around it.  I would look up videos to try and cover the mesh.. some people use got2b glue on the inside of the cap and let it dry to cover it up.  Personally I am a silk top girl and if I dont like the lace on the wig that is touching my scalp I put the wig a bit father back to almost see my hairline and I color it with brown eyeshadow powder.  Hard to explain but it looks a lot more natural.   You should also put Freedom Couture in your title so more people can see it.  I know I am glad to have found your video before purchasing.  Thank you for the honest review.  Your wig is workable though so don't worry!
the pieces near your ears that you were struggling with, i've seen people use double sided tape on their face and like stick it down and it works and also gives you a nice little face lift
ur supposed to cut the lace around wig
I've seen great tutorials from black women who basically wear wigs 24/7 and they glue the lace to their own hairline and it looks flawless.
She looks like the chick from Glee.  Santana.
those wigs would look so good if u knew how to properly wear then 😭😭
The girl with the blonde hair looks like jhene aiko. The other one looks like Kendall Jenner.
There are so insanely amazing wigs out there! Look up Diniwigs online or insta!
Tip! If you plan on wearing the wig with the cap try picking up a dark coloured wig cap so it doesn't show through the wig! Light coloured caps work better with light coloured wigs so it doesn't look like weird patches :) also netted caps are a lot more comfy than stocking caps!
Chloeeeee you look like Kendall jennerrrrr
To ware a wig you should shave you head smooth to ware a wig .Otherwise if got hair leave a loan.say no to wigs .
It actually looks terrible I think these are the worst wigs I've seen 😮
This was so entertaining 😂\nJust use clip extensions. Haha
It's cute that you guys don't know about wigs. Tip: please don't use that tape. It will pull your hairline out. Put the wig slightly behind your hairline and bobby pin the sides.
Chloe! Watch a tutorial of a black girl doing it..!!!! They are the pros at it
I watched a couple of front lace wig videos and some of the ones I watched the people cut the lace off before they put on the wig and I think that would be much easier and you could get some of the side bit of mesh/lace.
Dumb white girls
I think the girl with brown hair could bear me a fine son.
Hahaha loved this! Some people do glue it down :) and makeup would help but cut it where you can still see it! Xx
You should get Louise Pentland on your podcast! Xx
Matching colour again 😂
Vlogmas? :D
Welcome back! We've missed you ❤️ love your podcast btw! I'm expecting twin girls with 3 weeks left before my C-section, so it's really inspiring!!! ❤️
Shouldn't the title of this actually be Recently I've Been? 😁
Love to see you back Gi, glad you've had time to spend with your family. I listened to your podcast with Emma Willis and Izzy Judd, both were brilliant in different ways. I will be using the Jo Elvin, Frankie Bridges and the next one on Monday to do my long run to. Hopefully doing 8 miles on Monday. Have a great day Gi x
We've missed you! But I'm excited to read the book 😁
I’ve been losing sleep
Just finished 'Billy and Me' and really like it and I have 2 questions:\n1) any chance it's gonna be published in Poland?\n2) is this fair to put boyfriend standards this high with Billy? Me as single now have to take normal boy?
You 100% used ‘lately’ instead of ‘recently’ to stop the McFly reference comments...🙈
Hi Gi, firstly I absolutely love you and your gorgeous family! I've been watching your vlogs for years now and you always make me smile! My friend and I recorded this song for a competition https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=dtIfZLWQcCw and I was wondering if you could please have a listen? It;s the first thing we've done like this and are a bit anxious. Thank you xx
Haha let buzz and buddy help with the Halloween make up this year haha
When (I assume Tom) walked past in the hallway at 6.26 I totally freaked out 😂
I have hyper mobility too
I’ve got hypermobility and fibromyalgia!!! I do get where you’re coming from Gi ❤️
My husband and I just found out that we are expecting a baby in December. We had no idea that we were pregnant. But now that we know I've been reading  Happy Mum Happy Baby. And I have cried several times. Thank you for saying everything that needs to be said to future parents! Everyone has there own way of parenting and no one way is right and I'm so glad that I ordered it.
..... HAVING A WEDDING #tom'sweddingspeech
I LOVE the podcast! I listen to it while nursing ^^
I've recently been diagnosed with hyper mobility and hyperalgesia (hyper sensitivity to pain) and it was explained to me as a hyper flexibility or double jointedness in the bones and when the joints do overextend it puts stress in the nerves which is what causes the pain later on
Muscle pain is horrid i feel ya girl
Will there be a book signing for some kind of wonderful??!!!
Would love to here Anna Saccone-Joly on your podcast another YouTube Mum xx
Hyper mobility is a killer! I have it mainly in my knees too x
Gi, you look absolutely beautiful! This lighting suits you!
we've been Trying to conceive now for 7 years it honestly felt like it was never going to happen i saw rubbish doctors that where really insensitive and i've just started with a new team in a different hospital i had my 2nd appointment yesterday the difference it makes having people that are good at what they do and compassionate is huge and at the moment i'm feeling much more positive about things i've just started listening to your pod cast with izzy but have to pause it and will continue it later when i have some more time to listen.
Wow G stop and take a breath.love your videos hope you knees soon feel better.xx😀
hi I know you have been doing all the exercise but are you walking... need to get those miles in
At 1:27 an orb shoots out the door on the left. thought i would point that out x
#20 On Trending
pleeease do vlogmas!
Love the podcasts
Yesss you’re  back woo hoo !!!
I love you
I can't wait for your book! <3\nIs there any way to follow your trip to Iman (outside the UK?)
I've got to say that I couldn't stop paying attention to Tom instead of you. Please don't be mad at me!
Not related to your vlog in anyway Gi but LOVE your tablecloth 😍
Oh Christ she’s not pregnant again Is she?? She’s finally off tv and then she gets sprogged up again
Hi Gi  I hav Elhos Danlos Syndrome hypomomobility type it means i am am very bendy and stretchy  but can dislocate and sublax joints too so i know ur pain!!. Its a constant battle to what i am allowed and not allowed to do!! Mine also affects internal organs as well, forvusczebras its a constant battle but we fight on! Keep strong!!! We all cry sometimes xxxx
I'm sorry but more people need to be talking about this. There are pop stars that get all the glory but there are real, under-rated underdogs like P!nk and Kelly Clarkson who are just FULL of talent but don't get the attention they deserve.
She's pure gold.
The studio version is brilliant but wow, this LIVE version is PHENOMENAL. Kelly is such an amazing vocalist. Her new album already deserves a big publicity, popularity and tons of Grammys
I have no words to describe the awesomeness of this performance. Kelly is the epitome of a TRUE artist. Not too many artists out there today who are as diversified or talented as Kelly is>>>
Kelly you look and sound beautiful as always! I forever fan since the beginning I will always cherish you! XO
Absolutely amazing. Can’t wait to hear the album.
Kelly believe me... you moved me like that!
What an incredible performance in every way.  From the girl with the best voice in Pop music, to her unbelievably talented background singers, to her truly talented band.
She's perfect <3
SING SING SING KELLY! Shes so talented it is unbelievable!!!
Goosebumps!!
FAVE SONG 😍
Oh Kelly, the times we are in we don't deserve someone like you. My goodness though I'm grateful you're around. ❤❤❤
Her vocals are exactly like the original recorded song! WOW! GOOSEBUMPS
DAMN KELLY!!!   I LOVE THIS
I've loved her since idol. She is such a talented powerhouse and we get to be blessed by the great music. I'm always blown away when I hear her live because she sounds even better than the record. I can't wait for the new album!
Wow, simply wow this could be her defining song. Her hero or I will always love you she's up there with them.
The background singers are insane
Praise the Lord, she's herself now! Thank you, Atlantic Records...sort of...you guys are the ones who have actually lucked out!
Incredible! Amazing! Perfeita como sempre! Que voz!
This woman has an extraordinary voice. 👏👏👏🎶🎤🎵
My God...this is so beautiful. Sure moved me. I'm bawling.
Kelly has one of the better voices today.   Amazing.  Go Mrs Burleson!
She deserves so much more than she gets, Kelly is a beautiful soul that shows us what a true artist looks, sounds, and acts like. This is music!
this song makes me cry
Mmmm, the way u move me...
This is music.  This is artistry.  Absolutely superior.
This is one of my favorite things Kelly has ever done. This song, this video especially, always moves me and makes me so emotional.
I'M SO EXCITED FOR THE MEANING OF LIFE!!
Her  voice is amazing
The very 1st American Idol winner...\n🌺🔅🌺🔅🌺
Damn..... this was fantastic. :) love her cant wait to her the whole album.
Voice of an angel, a band like a newborn baby - sweet and adorable, and a song as beautiful as all of the others that has been recorded by kc ❤❤❤❤❤

Now you're singing like a know you can.
Great \n\nSubscribe, watching & download mp3 On My Channel :-D\ngoo.gl/cICvOy
This version is so much better than the studio one. That tells you the knd of artist Kelly is
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v67V3KtaSno
Wish she did this on xfactor finale
100x better then adele
11 really silly/stupid people out there. I mean, I respect different tastes in music, but disliking this song??? WTF?
Which imagery did you guys connect with the most? For me, the thrill of christmas morning.  I distinctly remember that childhood experience of waking up a little chilly and running downstairs while hearing x-mas music and seeing a glowing x-mas tree..plus the gifts of course.  As a child, it last a lifetime.
I couldn't love this more!!
Such restraoned power in her voice.
The beauty in the the whole aspect of this song
Even with 50 CENT in tha house playing the drums, Kelly sounds amazing!
EPIC... Just Amazing. Without autotune, Live and Just better than the record...
Verdadeira , Maravilhosa , com certeza alguém que esta cumprindo uma missão muito especial aqui nesse mundo , memorável , amável , Mulher forte determinada , incrivel ... Não tem como não querer conhecer Kelly Clarkson ... Que honrra ainda em 2017 ouvir essa grande artista , apreciar essa obra de arte unica.
Clicked *like* before i can even hear a second of the song. Duh.
Wow. What a performance. :'-)
Incredible...I have no other words.
The real deal ! Kelly is amazing
Please, come back to Brazil! \n\nO Brasil te ama 👏😍
Stunning.  I'm so buying this album
Ok, this song MUST be a single! Sooooo beautiful! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️\nI love you girl. Can't wait for your new album... *-*

SLAY MY LIFE QUEEN !!! 😩😩😩👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🔥🔥🔥🔥👸🏼
Maravilhosa 😍
Amo q últimamente hagan los videos en sesiones d estudios! Se puede apreciar mas sus voces ❤❤
8 people gave this a thumbs down.  Really?  8 people?  Did these people confuse thumbs down for being freaking awesome?  This performance is amazing.  Definitely in the top 10 of her performances.  The production of this is just phenomenal.  How she doesn't win all of the Grammy's is beyond me.
just wondering; why she is not using her vevo account anymore?
No Ray J. Go back to Singing.
I don't understand how people can sit up and keep watching complex news they are horrible I mean cringe worthy😬😬😬👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿😒😒💀
Why this interview just feel so off like something just not quite right and I can't quite put my finger on it..
I hit it first explain to me how humble you are
these niggas censored that lean from Ray J Tahe this L Complex
This episode just might be worse than Sza and Issa Rae
What does he got?
joe budden is weird\ndj akademiks is irrelevant\nthat bitch jus needs to kill herself
I would def let him screw me in all 3 holes on camera
And he over 25 he a old head -Uzi
They wanted ray j to go up there & embarrass himself but he flipped the script on em
Did this nigga just really just made lean in interview
i have to think..im telling you his tone of voice just makes the shit sound correct
Ray J: Epitome of a lame nigga
 A bunch of checks for the fuckery.  Ray J  much love and respect.....
Ray j got that pipe 20k a month.
He playin crazy about that R.kelly stuff fr
Lil Yatchy: I don't hate nothing, I'm making money living life.\n\nJoe: WHAT THE FUCK!? HOW ARE YOU FUCKING HAPPY!!!!?? \n\nRay J: I don't hate nothing, I'm making money living life.\n\nJoe: That's what's up man good for you.
i been to silicone valley.  i seen, like ......i seen it
and did he jus confirm Chris is on drugs
He keeps saying sorry cause he was tweaking yet he's drinking lean now lol
LMAO Ray J is ALWAYS being made fun of without knowing it smh. His level of intuition is ZERO. Joe said well if Ray J said it, it must be right. You can tell deep down Joe sees him as a clown. The same way Charlemagne did. The same way we all do. But from Ray J to Cardi B ignorance is accepted and rewarded in today's world
Bye Bitches 👋🏾
How is the  nigga getting interviews,when was the last time  he was in the radio?..2001?
Ray J is very delusional very
Has anybody noticed that this fake ass tech mogul, fake ass rapper,fake ass celebrity is faking drinking lean.
I TOLD YOU 5 seconds later... yeah im humble.
Damn it's fucked up how they were reaching for dirt the whole interview SMH
The reason why I like the breakfast club is cause they ask the question people want to ask . This guys just go searching for a story even if they aren’t interested
Ray J matured. Complex wit the clickbait. This my first dislike
Ray J and Kanye have to be related!
The sprite bottle is probably blurred out because they don’t wanna give sprite free promotion.. that’s why sometimes rappers shirts or certain labels will be blurred out in their video
Is Ray J a football fan? https://goo.gl/N6ruJc
I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE ACTUALLY COMPARE THIS DRY ASS LAME SHOW TO THE BREAKFAST CLUB ! ??? LMAO 😂😂😂
I'm humble. - Ray J\n\n😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bye Bitches! LOL ladies this is what a professional liar sounds like
Which Ray J interview are they talking bout that was so great ??
Craplex done it again dry ass joe budden,weakest interviewer and ak carries them the most
Rayj and Budden should be gay for each other
what's in his cup? lol
everyone using nadeskas lap to rest on
This nigga Ray J has lived a great life deadass. This nigga thotted Out the most famous women in the world grew up on TV as the little brother to a Grammy award winning sister and had one of the most remembered VH1 reality shows of all time he going down as a goat easily
Fake ass title to get viewers smh. Everyday struggle only got 4 more months then it's a wrap
If i had one wish\n*Joe budden premier skin for injustice 2 😂😂😂😂*
Wilding out and being high af is two different Shits
I def didnt see him wild out! I love his growth Great interview. And the album being called Raydemption I would like to hear some r &b like One Wish & another song  w Lil Kim
Did they say he was wildin just cuz he had the lean cup at earlyoclock in the morning or something. Ak ain't neva have to click bait niggas. Complex weak
Ray j just Seems Like the type of Guy who just talks ..
Guess Kanye won't be stepping foot into Complex anytime soon.
Joe, you don't understand California, there are helicopters everywhere. At least in the cities - Oakland and LA. Very different than the east coast.
Complex, Click Bait titles that aren't truthful diminishes your integrity.
Why do these overrated artist with one or two hits think they're so relevant and impact is so strong. U acted like a fool your whole career ray j.
If you like being introduced to new artist and new music as well as interacting subscribe to our channel
11:10 the realest shit I've ever heard someone say... like Vince Staples said, Ray J can never take an L
Why he got the white cups with the blurred out sprite bottle tho!!!???     LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!
The reason we have the Kardashians and The Breakfast Club.. If only he could cash the royalties
This nigga better not drop no fucking album named Raydemption.
Damn this nigga rich asl. Who else you see with 3 cups smh
Ray J's stuck in 2011 with 3 cups sipping nothing.
Yukmouth brought me here
Ray J hit it first kanye
This nigga retarded but smart and Joe need to stop sucking the guests off, fucking lame
For a man to play it so cool and they say he wilds out is too much for me. Im sure theyll change the title of this video soon but oh boy is this fake news title of the year. Much respect to Ray J keeping it cool and not going haywire on these crazy nutty show hosts. The fact that they were trying to push his buttons is the fact that they sensationalized the headline when they couldnt get him to go haywire. Wow. Ray J is dope for keeping his head. Pause.
I like but, not them bars
&he's trying to make a baby...
Raytronics ? Shit sound like a porn site 😂😂😂
Jo Budden a hater
Nigga Joe said RayDemption is mature..
Everything that comes out his mouth sounds like a lie lol
8:35 iss.. iss.. isszz cowwect- Inspirational quotes by Ray j

Lmao clickbait title
Mr rugs is that niggia
And water, many people are saying, is wet.
Thank you, Mr Trump, for explaining to the world what the definition of an island is.
And this is all the result of a storm. Made of wind. Big wind. Hurricane wind.
Please make it stop.
This is an island. Surrounded by water. Big water. Ocean water.\n-the leader of the free world
Who talks like that a 3 year old?
There is no way his brain is running on all cylinders.
this is the idiot with the nuclear codes
This is an island, surrounded by water\n\nJust in case you confused it with an island not surrounded by water.
Dark, dark times. From Obama to this? Incredible, yet there he is!
This is physically painful to listen to. I can only imagine what his speechwriters feel watching him fumble around like that and drop off script constantly.
Puerto Rico is not just surrounded by water--it's surrounded by bigly water!
No more !!! Please !!! Make it stop !!!
And Island surrounded by water? For real!?? Who knew!
This shit can't be happening! WHY????
Can a fucking meteor just end us already...
He is an embarrassment to the American people. And a dangerous man to the world
I heard this on the radio and thought it was a joke, but WOW like that is what an island is,  An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water.  define it for me you 3rd grader...
An island surrounded by water  no fucking shit Sherlock I bet there were major face palms back stage
Painful to listen to and to watch. No need to go into the words he's saying. That's self explanatory. But someone also needs to just put one teleprompter in the front. Trump looks like a fool reading when they're at the sides. He doesn't have the skill to make it look natural.
its an island surrounded by water , big water , ocean water
Unbelievable; what moron.
BOI DAS SOME BIG WATER HAHAHAHAHAH
What an absolute, blithering FOOL!!  How much longer must we endure this disgusting disgrace?
Our President is a child.
Heard smarter responses from beauty pageants
This tops people die when they are killed.\nThanks Trump, thanks.
The use of 'totally', TWICE in less than 2 minutes. It burns my ears!!!
Trump can barely speak coherent English. This isn't having a New York accent, this is ridiculous.
I thought puerto rico was surrounded by dasani water, boy was I mistaken
Obama would have had aid to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands 8 days ago.😏
Brawndo's got what plants crave. It's got electrolytes.
New meme?
There is also fish in the water. Big fish. Fish that swim type of fish. Fish.
I'm surprised he didn't say, Surrounded by wet water. Nothing is too insane for Trump.
This dude acts like a 4th grade kid who is doing a book report who does not have his notes
Big water
He's a nobfaced arse twat ! Waste of seamon and a utter utter bastard!
Ok I see we have a very smart president, island with big water  we are truly fucked and everyone supporting him probably think just like him dam dam dam I know homeless people speak better than this and he the president dam
This is a dumbass surrounded by aholes, big aholes, big jerkoffs
I don't even call this FOOL my President. The guy never makes any since when he does a speech. Got damn it.. Can he just hire a Writer that will make it easier for him to say something smart?  He always exaggerate . We never seen a situation like this  Really?  WTF is wrong with him?  lol
So this is what a high IQ sounds like? Fuck, I hope I don't have one.
US intelligence steals electric cables and sends them to Florida
Dump actually does the impossible -  makes Bush 2 look like a Rhodes Scholar.
Wow just wow. George W Bush was more intelligent.
We are bringing in trucks. Big trucks. Full of gas. On tires.
It just 1,033 miles from Florida to Puerto Rico.
Does anyone even care he wants to help the port of gold? I get its funny, but chill out guys. He's done great things so far.
I don't know  if should laugh, cry, get mad or...????  He's Donald trump people
Somebody tell Fish Lips to sit down and shut the hell up.
I think this sums it all up. And I mean all of it.
Im going to go freeze myself for 4 years. Wake me up when we have a new president.
Fucking idiot. Just read from the fucking teleprompter and stop improvising.
What a complete demented (literally) fool.  Are you embarrassed yet??  Just stick to the teleprompter, I doubt it SAID THAT.
This incredible amount of education and knowledge is truly refreshing. GOOD JOB! Incredible! Each and every six-year-old will be proud of you. Make islands wet again! Repeal and replace the tides! Drain the irritating oceans! :-)
Just painful to watch.....PR is surrounded by big water says POTUS 45th. Disgraceful!
Americans better pray and hope that Donald Trump is only pretending to be stupid. The point of no return is when Trump starts believing in the things he is saying.
ESTUPIDO PRESIDENTE...
OBAMA HAD CLASS AS A PRESIDENT. BUT NOT EVERONE CAN BE AS NOBLE AS A BLACKMAN. some people are simple minded moron racist pigs sort of like police in amerikkka. This dreadful bloody history of this Cuntry that was built by Slaves For Free and now there made I wanna rest and take a Knee.
I’m not sure whether or not to like or dislike this video 😂
Seriously people!. You must know by now that Trump speaks to his voters, and it is clear to him that he must explain that an island is surrounded by water but not by any water but ocean water.
This fucktard inspires me that I can achieve anything!
lol he made it clear to us that the island is not attached to the mainland
that chin vagina is getting worse
Trump is Puerto Rico's Killer. BOOGIE MAN.
only if they are white and his voters like tx and fl.
The usa in 2017 is surrounded by trump redneck supporters bigger ignorance and wider americas foolishness
Without food or water, people die. Not alive anymore. Forever.\n\nDon't make absurd excuses. Help them live and not die. Oh and thanks. I would not have understood what island meant without your articulate explanation. *rolls eyes*
oh my fuckin god   what a fuckin  RETARD!!! AND EVRYONE THAT VOTED FOR HIM.....BIG RETARDS..AN ISLAND WITH BROWN PEOPLE ON IT...YOU MOTHER FUCKIN BIGOT!!!!! COME ON AMERICA LETS PITCH IN AND HELP PEURTO RICO OURSELVES!!! go to Ricky Martins YourCaring website....just a dollar each of us.....people are fuckin dying and Trump dont even care!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I swear to God in heaven this is the dumbest human being ever!
What an embarrassment Trainwreck Trump is to our country. I'm only glad my kids are too young to know.
Trumps speech on the situation is loaded with condescending signals. He repeatedly states how totally useless the Puerto Rican government is and kind of says we have to do everything for them not in a good way but as if he is complaining. It's terrible how rascist this official is. He can't even mask his internal rascism and emotions on the issue for a simple speech.
Someone needs to make a YouTube poop out of this.
Island Water! My vocabulary is improve ALL DAYS. Thanks you Premier Troomp!
lmao
Jesus he's a dumb fuck!!  Elitist, pompous, racist bastard.
F-tard
What a dumbass.
ｂｉｇ　ｗａｔｅｒ
aahhhhh ha haahahahhah lol ... 8 yrs of Obama traitor, now you get your 8 years ! looooooove TTTTRUmps Haaaate.. remember! : D
gotta love trump
LOL xD
Dear DOTARD Drumpf! New Orleans!
Basket case.
If you take out the duplicated phrases, this clip is 10 seconds MAX. However, the dictionary description of what an island is can be very helpful to all the 5 year olds out there. I never thought I'd say this, but I miss DubbaYaa's press conferences more and more every day!
Trump's an idiot.
Hehe oh right
Donald Trump has a lot of money. I guess that disproves the old adage that a fool and his money are soon parted.
Fake news nobody not that stupid in real life lol
He's a big dumb buffoon, isn't he folks? Save your breath. It must get tiring constantly defending this orange idiot...
But Puerto Ricans sucked US balls to be US State
Soo, it's a peninsula? - Trump Supporter
President Trump needs to explain what an island is so libtards will understand, .... and yet libtards still don't get it.
Trump is actually a highly intelligent and well spoken business man, in private. Here, he is trying to communicate to his countrymen...a couple hundred million poorly educated mass-consumption fools, who have been dumbed down by generations of liberal democratic education programs and moronic Hollywood entertainment. I feel sorry for him, because most of his fellow Americans have become too brainwashed by the (closet communist) liberals to understand his good ideas. Glad I am not American.
looks fantastic! I really enjoyed watching you create it too.
You would be my favorite writer if you ever wrote a book.
I have to say it...I love your work, John, but the first time I saw your video I was shocked and thought at first you're kind of creepy. That's just because you are so different, so refreshing and you have something special in yourself. And you make me feel addicted to watching you, I don't know why. The more I watch you, the more I'm fascinated about your personality, as if you were an old soul like me. I also absolutely love the tone of your voice, as well as the vocabulary. I will be supporting you forever.
If victimhood is a fashionable trend and trends for the anxious, are all anxious people victims?   Thank you for great content!
you just gave me what i didn't know i needed 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Welp now I have to get my entire body tattooed blue...
love your videos, they're so pleasant to watch ❤️
Your voice is so soothing and you are so engaging and so lovely! Also you explain in such extensive detail. I also enjoy your vocabulary and witty humor. Thank you for this video! It has definitely given me some ideas!
He is so beautiful! I love his blue eyes! <3
Jefferee star wishes he was you.
You will never understand how thrilled I am to have discovered your channel!!
Could You please make a video about Your favorite books :)
I absolutely adore your videos and I admire the type of content you create because it is more sophisticated than most other videos in the beauty community. Additionally your amazing language is not only enjoyable but enables me to study for my English exam while watching makeup tutorials. Thank you for that.
This was fantastic. Loved it.
I LOVE your content and enjoy watching so so much. You have such a different style compared to other makeup YouTubers that is so refreshing. 💙
Have you thought about doing lip swatches ? I never find people pale enough on ytube to assess how a lipcolour is going to translate on my skintone\nI know these are not the most excititing videos to film, probably, but I figured I'd ask anyway
I love the way you talk\nI love your looks\n....I love you....\nPlease let's get married and have tea everyday ❤️
Do an Elizabethan look next time, it would be sooo refined!!
I'd love to see Tron and 1980s futurism  inspiration.. Much love
Super gorgeous!
Anwen sent me!
Your are so, so talented John. Incredible! 💋
PLEASE DO MORE ELABORATE/UNUSUAL LOOKS
Love it , I would totally wear it to work, reminds me so much of Peter Burns
You bought me BACK to life! I thought I was living....but I was existing!
You are quite an artist! What an amazing look. I'd love to see more looks like this, especially since Halloween is coming up. Amazing video!
You are incredibly quotable, and it is absurd in the loveliest manner possible!
I could listen to a audio of your voice without any video and be completely content and happy but the work you did is amazing!!! Idk which side I liked the most.
This is so amazing!
How do you learn to talk like this?? Seriously someone link me a video I MUST adopt this accent it is everything
That’s ART in its purest form . I admire your sophistication . A rare commodity now a days .
I like John, but I hate this character he’s made. Look at his first video to now, this accent is so fake and not necessary
I seriously cannot stop watching your videos. I've never come across someone so skilled at the art of makeup.
I wish I was able to give your videos a thousand thumbs up. You are, without a doubt, my favorite person on YouTube as of late. 🤗🤗🤗
There are simple makeup artists...and then there are artists who happen to choose makeup for their medium. You are the latter. Positively stunning!
how i did my makeup in high school john i’m waiting
You're a beautiful soul🖤💙
Oh my God, your channel is growing! I'm so excited for you!
I feel like you're staring into my soul and judging all of my life decisions. Your eyes are such a piercing, icy blue, and you rarely blink. I adore your videos regardless.
That looks is GORGEOUS!!! I love the contrast between the made-up side and the more organic side. I also adore how you teach how to play with the light in our day to day makeup while showing it in this editorial look!! Wonderful!!
5:19 ...victim, which is very fashionable to be, nowadays. Oh my word you are a killer hahahaha.
This isn't makeup this is art
Hey john I love your YouTube channel and I think that you have awesome makeup videos. There super helpful for me when it comes to putting on my makeup everyday. I was wonder if u would ever be interested in doing like a mukbang eating show or an asmr show? Love you xoxo
More weird looks! This totally made me want to be an alien for Halloween. 😍😍😍
Would anyone eles love to hear him say yassss slayyy queen just me? Ok
Why don't you have more subscribers, you are perfect!
Your voice and accent is so stunning
I'm really not a fan of them. I think they're slightly rancid. I'm cackling with wild abandon here! :'D
5:18 victim which is very in fashion to be in nowadays 😂😂😂
This is gorgeous!! I would just add some bright contact lenses!
“Now I’m going to begin sculpting the face with Illamasquas powder eyeshadow in te shade ‘Victim’... which is very fashionable to be nowadays”\n\nThat shade doe.
I am in love with how sophisticated you speak and your voice, makeup and everything!!
Can you please list products used in your description box in future videos? Please and thank you
All of her videos feels like a master class not just a tutorial.
New Subbie. You're accent is very regal and stunning. You have me hanging on hour every word!
Listening to you talk and create is my therapy
I look forward to watching your videos. You are teaching me so many things, makeup and vocabulary
Incredible look by an amazingly talented artist. More avant garde creations please! Much love :}
I love how the Krylon looks. I would love to see you do a Krylon pale skin foundation video.
If I attempted this look I'd look like a mauled Smurf. You are very skilled and it's a pleasure to watch!
This is indeed quite chic
when i apply gel liner in the waterline, i take the end of a brush and dip it in the liner, it irritates my eye less
You're simply a breath of fresh air. I'm upset over the immense amount of time I've wasted on less-than-brilliant channels these past few years.
I love seeing you opening up more to us <3
Those people who dislike this are complete buttocks.
The face and makeup is amazing but I personally don’t feel the red wig goes with it
I am impressed. However I can't help but cringe at the thought of washing all of the brushes after this...
Your voice is so soothing, I could listen to you all day!
It has a bit of a Blade Runner feel. Just Beautiful, John.
You have an artist's eye! I'm a graphic designer and I'm really enjoying how you use color, gradient and lighting in a way that compliments the curvature of facial features. I always know when I have a great design when I can't stop looking at it. I feel like you've accomplished that feeling with this tutorial. I would really enjoy it if you shared more of these editorial and artistic looks with us. They are very amazing and show us the power of makeup in a way that isn't being portrayed on YouTube.
Well I died and went to creative makeup heaven
he soinds so enthused to be doing this look, its lovelt to see him so happy and passionate
This is magic! You're brilliant!
Victim, which is fashionable to be lately Fantastic! I love that you have such wonderful little lines within your videos!
You're the bob ross of makeup 😊
19:34 - 19:58 me in the mirror every morning
Why does he remind me of morticia?
This is almost reminiscent of the cubism art style! Love it!!
I've often been dissapointed at the lack of vocabulary of some other MUAs on youtube, but this is almost the complete opposite, far more in depth & more explanatory.
This video is probably my favorite in YouTube
Amazing !!,
fantastico!!
So beautifully scientific! Amazing! X
Stunning
Ugh that cut crease is life!
WOW.
I adore your voice ohmygosh
Vampy vibes loving it
19:48 my favorite thing
I'm stunned 😍👌
His smile makes me smile
Gorgeous!
“Slightly rancid”
greasy finga
nice vid, thank you!
What a fruit.
Reminds me of Mystique
i love you ❤❤❤
Not hating, but he sounds like the tour guide from Spongebob when they went to Atlantis
I love this.  The black side (with the blue highlights) would make an excellent base for a galaxy inspired design - replete with comets, stars and nebulae.  Thank you for all your excellent videos!!
Been here for a while and im proud
His dancing always kills me. It's adorable. Love this song and video ♥️
[Verse 1]\nYou try to kill it but it won't stop bleeding\nTry to forget it but it won't stop killing you\nYou're running out of time\nYeah, you know you can't go back\nIt's too late\nTo say it's too late\nYou can't take back that you said nothing\nHow could you do nothing?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIs this burning right?\nAm I living bridges?\nCan we build our past right?\nLearning through future solecism\n\n[Chorus 1]\nIt's played out (I've missed times)\nI've moved on (been disconnected)\nGet fucked up (I stressed time)\nMy new draw (forgetting timing)\nAnd it's not right (and I need you to talk me down)\nYou're dead wrong\nWhat are we doing? ('cause I feel like I need to crash)\nLet's go home\nThere's no hope\nIt's all wrong
EDEN Brazil loves you! and me too

There is something bad about this song....it ends....
Something about this music video felt so real, I was mesmerized.
I have waited so long
The beginning is Vertigo I believe. That is pretty cool.
Hey EDEN I'm a huge fan and I was wondering if I could rock+roll or circles in my monthly montage for my overwatch gameplay that I'm gonna launch tomorrow so I'm just checking now If it's ok and I love this song it was worth the wait 😀😀😀
Who's cutting onions in here?
why am i crying in class

143 people obviously have never herd good music before🤷🏻‍♀️
We need a blackbear & EDEN or a phobe ryan & EDEN collab

I love all EDEN songs because they're so real and raw with emotion but literally this song with the video made me cry like a little kid. This is fucking next level shit. Beautiful.
Please put everything you've ever done on itunes so I can give you my all money!
You dont even know how much i relate to this, it calmed me so so much
I always love eden song I only know everything he talks about it the stuff I'm going though and he inspires me to write my own song that are as good as he's I song one of my song 4 my mom so she knows I'm the same person as I was lil
I listened to this song for 2 hours straight and it still wasn't enough, I can't explain to you the feeling this gives me.
How can you NOT love this???
What camera is used? It’s great for filming
Jonathon is the only artist I can listen to all day on repeat. I just want to say thank you. Your sound has helped my friends and I get past the rough patches in our lives. It has also helped one of my friends pursue he dreams in music. No other artist can or will ever do what your sound does for us. That You EDEN
I loved  it  sm  💙💙💙 nd the music  video  is just  sensational i found  the  whole  song  amazing  bless  u jonathan  u really  know  how  to  be  you  a different  individual beautiful  human being 🌸🌼🌸💙
The best part about Jon's music videos is he features aesthetic sky and beauty of nature instead of girls jumping around in bikini. Such a gorgeous song and video
I  wish I could give you more than a like! your songs are AMAZING. Honestly please never stop this
Your my idol\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP.s you kinda look like an older version of my brother
It's funny because the day before I looked to see if he released anything new or when he last released it, and then I saw this one and lost my shit
Hey Eden, great song! You are one of my favourite artists, I hope I will see you live one day. The song just kick ass'es, I listen to that song to get into flowstate before I start to grind. Keep up that great work.  BR
this is such a beautiful film, the song is pretty good too xD
Ever since Eden Project this man is the goat
Wow Amazing video :O EDEN

Holy shit, the song and video fit so good together. It was worth to wait all this time for a new song. Continue with the great work Eden  😊
Such a good song Love you Eden ❤️
Of course I hope there is a heaven.\nThe thought is extremely comforting to my fears of losing those I love.\nBut there's no reason to believe in any of the manmade gods.\nI don't see why I should compromise my morality and intellectual integrity for fear.\nIt's life.  None of us get out of it alive.
such a beautiful work of art - this is truly a masterpiece
make more music dont ever stop keep going
A beautiful song made by a beautiful man
First listen seems kinda bad to me, but not it sounds rly rly good ! But it's the first time his perfect lyrics don't talk to me yet :/
IM SO IN LOVE WITH YOU! \nPLEASE MARRY ME!\nYOU SAVED ALL THE LAST YEARS FOR ME AND NOW OMG!\nPLEASE BE MINE FOREVER, YOU ARE THE BEST!
the bes music x
IM SO LATE AND I CANT EVEN LISTEN TO IT BECAUSE I HAVE NO HEADSET AHHH FUCK MY LIFE
I absolutely love the song but I think this is a rare case where the video detracts from the music. The whole time I'm trying to figure out the importance of the footage but realize there really isn't any. Yes it's beautiful and sure it can be argued that it's a similar feeling of the song but it's just not capturing me as much as the music itself.
At first, I didn't like this song that much. I really like EDEN and I was like... maybe it is just me. But every single time I listen to it, I like it a little more. It has come to the point I like it as much as Rock + Roll
I need you singing in Brazil!
FUCK YES A NEW EDEN SONG!!!!! THERE IS A GOD! :D ily EDEN <3
EDEN's visual effects are some of the best out there. His songs, videos and pictures inspire me all the time.
EDEN keeps smashing through his own ceilings. Beautiful piece 👌🏻
By far the best music video ever
He should do a studio version of amnesia.
MARRY ME ALREADY ):
fucking masterpiece
HYPE
his songs are dope !!
amnesia pls :(
Project VIBES <3
marry me

I cried for the first time since my breakup today and it was because of this song. It's been almost a month
As all of your other songs, I: A; will become obsessed and listen to it daily, or b; at first I dont like them than I morph into letter A😂. Really good shit keep it up

Very informative and useful series of videos. Thank you for making and sharing these videos with us.
👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Lesson to be learned here ......... Don't pour hot wax in your crack
I just watched all 14 of these videos. That's pretty neat what you made there. Good job.
Enjoyed watching that . Great job on the catch mechanism and leather concealment . Good step by step instructions with forethought and skills . Thanks for the cool video , learned a few things .
Very well done....a lesson in patience. Much value.
Nice craftsmanship Sir!
What's your email?\nFor questions.
What an amazing stick folks !!!!!!! Great set of videos and the workmanship is outstanding sir thanks for sharing...
Enjoyed the whole series! Well done.
You are a fantastically gifted teacher mate. Probably the best step by step tutorial I have ever watched. Many praises and outstanding job.
Thank you for the série, very informative videos, Iam belgium,excuse my for my bad english.
Great videos on the making of this stick. It is definitely on my to-do-list, as it is practical in more than one way.
Great work, maybe I will try a project similar
Thank you for your time HARLEYBAYO
Reminds me of the icelandic movie When the raven flies
It's a shame that in many locales, this would be considered as two illegal weapons - A billyclub and a sword cane.
Good day,\n\nGood job, especially using simple hand tools. I thought you were going to get bitten by the drill and then the blade, a little nick scratch is lucky.\n\nThank you for your time.
Watched all your vids of you making this stick. Very impressed. A few times I thought That's not going to work, but you made it work. Going to try and make something similar but with a crook handled walking stick.
Awesome series. Thumbs up.
The wow factor of the hidden knife is major.Would like to see some nice carving on the stick done with some hand held carving tools.Great job & a very useful walking stick.
That plug needs a faceplate folks make one of those dude all cool n shit 
All likes and a New Subscriber. You are very real in your videos; even down to the craziness, with the hot wax. Now I wonder how strong the stick is with a store bought dowel. LOL! never mind Video #15 answered the wondering I had. One other idea I have is next time maybe some rubberized paint over the steel tip. That way if a strike was actually need to be preformed for protection or just a dropped stick the paint would not chip and reveal the steel. ( ? ).
This is Dope!
I bet if you set up a web store and put a disclaimer about how its a weapon you could possibly sell them and I bet a lot of people would pay a lot for one including myself. The craftsmanship is incredible!
man watching all them different videos I just finished hahhaa should of put half in one long video and the other half in another but that was an awesome build sir
A nice product after all the effort!! However,in a self defense situation a gun would be much more effective!!
I really enjoyed your series! You're truly a master craftsman. Thanks for sharing.
your my hero. really amazing walking stick. I make walking stocks put of diamond willow and for the bottom I cut a piece of runner tire to match the bottom of the stick, counter sink a stainless screw.
Quite the project, excellent and very intense crafting of the various connecting parts.\n\nLightly heating the blade to remelt and re-mold the wax may have been OK too.\n\nI make walking sticks, canes, fighting staffs+sheleighlieghs- both artistic+functional and nice+functional.\n\nThis project here was more than labor intensive, with artist skills needed for fit+form.\n\nOnly seen improvement was the end touching the ground could have a couple of steel rings or 1- 2 thin pipe on the end of the stick where the rubber bumper screwed in to totally secure that end or it could split over time and with use. \nToo much went in to it to lose it that way for such a reason.\n\nThe effort here was priceless as to the creative work needed to complete it successfully ~!\n\nI many times use a copperplumbing cap- drilled thru into the end then screwing a masonary bolt(super hard metal) with silicone in the hole and under the copper cap.\nThen buy rubber caps at a hardware store for canes or crutches depending on the size needed.
ph.d mechanical engineering skills ;lots of nice tools and equipment; professional leatherwork ( zombies beware )
hi next time you should sharpend your blade before doing a wood Sheet your blade will fit more at the ending
really nice thanks for sharing
Awesome stick folks
hawt wax aw owva da pwace lmao :) (00:38)
thanks brother I really enjoyed watching you make that stick it was awesome cant wait to see what you do next.
That cap may have been from a pool stick or not
eurika
I have a similar Dewalt saw and It looks like the rollers that are at the end of the plastic guard that raises as you lower your saw and cut your stock. There are two on it. Thats my guess. Nice stick.
Amazing set of vids, great job, very impressive!
take a trick from when I bed rifle stocks. cover that blade in natural colored shoe polish then put a little jb weld inside the sheath. the polish will not let the jb adhere to the blade
Its great but short enough to be a Peg-Leg
Nice! Is it for sale?
Awesome project!
you could so make some big $$ making and selling them
Dude, you crack me up.  I love the walking stick and your motivation to get it done.  But man do you love doing things the hard way. :)
I built a similar cane. More of a walking staff with a deer antler dagger in the top. I figured out a method to keep the knife in place. Rare earth magnets, but it still rattles like a bitch and I cant deliver it to the customer in that shape. Hot wax is a good idea but I don't want my blade to have wax on it. I considered silicone and greasing the blade but i'm too afraid to pull the trigger any suggestions.
I watched all the videos, you did a great job.
Nice job, really like your details.
You did an outstanding job on this project.  I am very impressed and so are some other people I have shown this video to.  Thanks for doing them.
I use two walking sticks all the time. (Been on crutches 9 times) Loved your videos. You have got some awesome skills. I on the other hand love ultra-light sticks when I walk but would love to have them out of wood. Guess I would need different type of wood to keep it light. I thought about an end cap on the bottom (rubber side) with a 3-4-or 5 prong cluster gaff for fish or snakes. The lower half would separate and harpoon some fish etc. Do you think it is possible? Anyway thanks for taking the time to share your knowledge with others. Peace, 4 Legged (hiking trail name)
Man this whole project was awesome, this has to be the ultimate weapon to kill bears or something! 
Still the best one out on the tube I like to make one but without the  blade just lead and and the cap on both sides 
Cool project! 1 last video would be cool too show the final product in detail, thanks
WTG brother...Good job....
That is awesome I wish I had the skills to pull something like that off great job.
How much does it weigh?
Man, you are truly creative.I started watching you and i could not stop. I would buy one for sure. Problem for me is the fu.....canadien laws. Your craftsmanship is so on the mark that you should start using your skills to create for hunters and people like me who love knifes, swords, walking stick just like you made. My first thought was wuold you make and sell me one but like i said, here in canada are laws are fu.............. Thankx much.  
That is amazing! I wish I had the tools and money to make one of these.
Thats one heck of a pig sticker! lol Great Vids. 
To much Hazzle !! this is stupid , Why not just buy a good sword cane ?
Nice job!\n you might consider using a crutch tip on the end, like I do, it's very grippy.
Holy crap! Getting caught carrying one of these in Denmark would definately get you arrested! Nice Work, though ;o)

He just wants to get some camera time...BVB really should look into upgrading in his position though.
Ich bin zwar eingefleischter ❤️Bayern❤️ Fan aber das Ritual und Video ist echt Mega... ist mir auch noch nie aufgefallen und macht Bürki gleich viel sympathischer. Daher gerne ein Daumen hoch für Bürki und das Video... 👍🏼 Geil auch, wie Spieler und Schiris ihm dem Ball teilweise schon völlig selbstverständlich zukommen lassen, nach dem Motto. Gebt ihm den Ball...⚽️
Name of the song, please?
Awwww
Don't put funny in the title
next time for referee, just give the ball to him instead he get the ball by himself xD
It is a mental game, he is getting in the head of the other team
Pretty adorable

What fucking retard. smfh
00:15 mit kollege djorou!
Eigentlich macht er genau das, was Manuel neuer schon immer macht. Sollte vlt lieber stattdessen mal aufs kurze Eck achten, anstatt andere zu imitieren.
Hahahahaha Roman
Hahah
Ja moin😂😂
Das macht jeder torwart vorher....
So cute !
BVB HUUUUUURENSÖHNE

Witzig ehhhhh

Fantastic =)
Sehr lustig....
😂😂😂😂
Bürki will denn Ball testen
Ich lach mich scheckich Freunde
Super der Junge! :) Total sympathisch

Bürki du bist der knaller 😂😂😂😂😂😂👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Wie Sokratis ihm selbstverständlich den Ball rübergibt 😂😂😂
Hahahahahahahahaha

Geile Aktion, geiles Video

Wie heißt das Lied?
Das macht neuer auch immer
das beste fand ich als er wie eine katzte durchdie beine von schiri sich den ball holt .. 😂😂😂😂😂
Was für ein Depp! Wie wärs mit einem Ritual nach jedem Stuhlgang die Toilletenrolle als Andenken an die Wand tapezieren
das hat wer von neuer geklaut... nixwisser...
Da werde ich in Zukunft mal drauf achten.\nAm besten finde ich das bei 0:30 :D
Ich sehs schon in den komentaren das ich so gehatet werde aber ich bin bayern fan und ein wenig schalke fan😁😁 ,#fcbforever
Ein Ritual hat doch jeder. Ich kratze mir morgens erstmal die Eier.
Neuer macht das vor jedem Spiel genau wie Fährmann es auch vorher so gemacht hat bevor er Kapitän wurde.
ICH SAG NUR KURZE ECKE
Der soll mal lieber seine kurze Ecke zu machen
Ist alle schüsse am kurzen eck reinlassen auch ein ritual von ihm?
Bürki ist Top und passt perfekt zu BvB
Vor einem Dortmund Video Bayer Werbung ?!? Nice!!!
Haha was macht der jung:)
Nur das das Neuer schon gemacht hat bevor Bürki schon bei Dortmund gespielt hat
Das beste ist bei 0:32😂😂😂😂
Schon aufgefallen,aber gibt es eigentlich einen Grund?😂
es un completo crack jajaja
Richtig lustig. Habe mich vor lachen weg geschmissen.
Bin zwar Bayern Fan,aber finde das Bürki ein guter,erfahrender und Sympathischer Typ ist 😂💪🏼
Ach man der roman
Bin ich der einzigste der das gerade zum erstenmal mitbekommt ? 😂
Can someone follow me JUST FOR LUCK BEFORE MY DATE with gf
Bringt ihm ja nicht sonderlich viel, wenn er die letzten Spiele fast jeden Ball der auf die Torwartecke geht nicht halten konnte
Und hält trotzdem nichts
Jake, be careful around that Ida character. He's got a few short circuits in his bionic implants.
That last tweet was fairly innocuous. But the response was brutal. Anally.

QUEEN OF THE NORTH! SLAY
Have you ever done a sugar skull tutorial? I've seen many but I would like to see your work on this
Do poppy from trolls or branch or a Bergen
this remix of the game of thrones theme tho <3
Wow the blue hair makes her look like someone in ahs
Lol, okay, i know this comment is slightly irrelevant, but could you do a zombie ballerina or creepy ballerina? I feel like all zombie makeup tutorials are based around guys (not yours though) I am in ballet and just thought it would be cool :)
Please do a lock shock and barrel tutorial before Halloween
We're do u get ur water base paint, I really don't know were they would be sold....plus I love ur videos there vary inspiring and u r a big role model in my life
Mykie please please do a zombie bite tutorial, I am self teaching myself and have been asked to do a zombie bite on someone by Halloween xxx
Ayyy, there's that Halloween pumpkin intro I've missed
You kinda look like Brienne from game of thrones right before you put on the mask. Am I the only one?
8:07 and 8:40 Despite living in a town 45 minutes away from Berkeley and an hour away from San Francisco, I never get that level of chill when I leave my house in something less extreme. One takeout guy wouldn't leave until I convinced him I was mentally sound! (I mean, I wasn't entirely, but that had little to do with why I was done up like the Corpse Bride)\n\n(Also, we have a fairly well-known theater as a prominent part of the downtown. For all anyone knew, I could be working at it.)
🖤🖤🖤
Looooooooooove it
Wow!!!!! Mykie this is absolutely UHHHMAAAAZZZZING!
Joffrey was a thundercunt
Please
DOPE. where are the contact lenses from?
I didn't know how much I needed this video!
Yassssss Halloween time!!!!! Leggggooooo mikeeeyy,  so excited for all the halloween tutorials 🤗🤗🤗😍😍😍
This comment has nothing to do with the video but... You're pretty pale... You should do a Fenty foundation review
Can you do the leper from IT, he looks pretty gnarly

THIS IS GREAT
THIS INTRO GOT ME SO HYPED IM SO BUZZIN
Andy: I love a threeway ... so casual.
I love a three way 🤣🤣👏🏽🤦🏽‍♂️
FERGIE is unbothered I love her.
I love how she didn't express the fact that she thinks they're alike in negative way. She ''praised'' both songs and didn't pit one woman against each other. I gotta admit I didn't expect that answer but I loved it. Way to go Fergie!
Ok why andy feel the need to bring up Taylorswift in every interview?
The song actually borrows from I'm Too Sexy.
nice way to dodge directly answering that question
I also love a threeway
If it was Taylor she would be sueing to the godss
wow she looks so gorgeous
I love her!
Andy says, I love a 3-way. LMAO!!! I bet he does.
Fergie is beautiful
So both songs are shite, gotcha.
First time I heard it I thought it was very Fergie!
It amazes me how Taylor has so many people hooked on her with such mediocre vocals and basic songs.
I noticed it too
THIS WAS THE FIRST THING I SAID WHEN I HEARD 'Look What You Made Me Do'
What! The chorus for Taylor's song had the best sampled from Too Sexy For My Shirt song, so I am confused why Fergie name is in the same mix.
I love it i love a threeway. I bet you do you creeper lmao
Fergie threw no shade I love her
They probably share the same songwriter that's why.
We all love 3 ways!
Yeah, they are both shit.
There are only so many combinations of music. Silly pricks trying to cause some drama.
As they used to say in the olden days Fergie's got CLASS.\nI said it right away about it sound like Fergie and the Black Eyed Peas
Why would she care that it sounds the same, the chorus of the new Taylor Swift song is shit, monotone, repetitive and boring and with that being the case it says a lot about the chorus of her song.
I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought that new Taylor swift song was meant for fergie
Ooh yeaah! Mushup! 😃 ...i think, the fuck NO 😤😒
Yeeesss her voice is so lovely!! Sing it!
Don't they all have the same song writers lol
I also noticed the look what you made me do in both songs when I first listened to Just Like You. Love both songs!!
Not feeling taylors song at all!!!
They were probably written by the same person.
Most pop songs sound the same to make sure it speaks to the mass/mainstream and sell for millions
I love a threeway? I bet the only threeway he had was with his dog and his TV remote control
I really like how nice and positive she is. ALSO WHEN SHE STARTED SINGING? Slay!
Sounds nothing like Taylor's song. She just want attention and views lol
It's like those vines where the guy's like oh is it the part that goes OHWAOooHAaaWAAAAOHWAAH?
Fergie is an amazing live singer
Did anyone else freak out when she started singing? Such a pure voice! Love you Fergie!
I love a threeway! Lmao Andy
That's a great answer to that question
Isn't she a mother of a child? Hmmmmm. Great goals!
Its true after hearing Taylor Swifts new song i thought she'd joined the Black Eyed Peas lol
They are both shite performers anyway.
I thought the song sounded like Boom Boom Pow rather than My Humps.
Clever reply, classy lady.
Where is the love?......remember that deep song....what happened? Do they have charities helping others?
Well they both took it from right said Fred - I’m to sexy.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dTZ5phVyvAw
Omg yassss 😍😩❤️
lol xD nope
So they're both shit artists ahhh I get you
What a legend
i love a threeway
Of course they sound the same. Their music is all written by the same guy.
Nobody claps or whoops after she sung..burn!
Both shit
👌 attitude. Classy lady!
Haha ......... Silance             😂
Stop using Botox
first time I heard Taylor's song I was like this is so fergie humps
Does anybody else cringe when people start singin like that?
Taylor is cancer
I can’t stand her
I would suck the farts out of her baking bowl.
Taylor Swift is a tranny. I was shocked when I found out the truth.
Irrelevant
poor thug
You know what? Fair play to her! I dont like Fergie i never have (except for the first 2 Black Eyes Peas albums and even then i didnt exactly LIKE her) but ive got a lot of respect after seeing this! She easily could have gone in for an attack on Taylor and point out how she sues everyone she can think of for the most pathetic and minor of similarities (she tried trademarking 'haters gonna hate' ffs a saying older than her and she wants to own it) but nope she kept a cool head and proved shes a better person than me 😂
oh fergie you pig just shut your mouth and go back to the drawing board
Die of aids
Hey folks, hope you enjoyed the video! It'd mean a lot to me if you guys checked out Tab for a Cause; what they're doing is truly amazing and I've proudly been opening tabs for just over a week now. As a stats nerd it's insane how something as mundane as the new tab page can help raise funds for charities across the world. Go download it here: http://tabforacause.org/businesscasual
When you can have registered lobbyists in a parliament/senate then it really shows that the democratic process is fucked up in a country....
Are you fine with the shitposter... I mean..... The editor putting Felix the trap in your videos
Do The Walt Disney Company!
Do Kodak next
Umm...... why was Felix the trap-o-cat hiding behind that stack of cash.....
Now AT&T likes to fuck us in the ass
I still love Business Casual, I'm pissed at YouTube for not giving me the notifcation though :P
AMD next! I've really been enjoying the videos lately.
Best girl is at it again. What does Felix say at 5:30?
What about Cingular?
Some notes on the weakened AT&T ... it was much larger and more profitable than the baby bells.  It ran 80% of the Internet.  It still had bell labs for its entire run.  I would trace its demise to the MCI worldcom multi-year illegality of stating false profits which real companies could not compete with.  Also a failure for the federal government to enforce the telecommunications completion act.  In the end the Internet bubble busted and the most unimaginative and backward baby bell, SBC, had the cash on hand to buy the name and what was left.
So... the US govt destroyed a company once, and now they're helping companies (such as; Google, Boeing, JP Morgan, etc) with tax payers money? I wonder....
Did tab for a cause pay you? Because if they did it means they’re not using 100% of the money I give for charity... they use that to advertiser (such as paying you) and maybe who knows? If they do that, they might also pocket some money
If it's free you're the product.
These videos are so good. Well versed, brilliantly created, punctuated with pure intelligence. THIS is what YouTube needs.. NOT Jerk Porl.
Fascinating learning the history of this huge businesses. To see their strategic plays over the years is interesting to see how they are still relevant today. Great videos!
can you do playboy? in honour of the late great Hugh <3
Satellite internet my peeps; thats where I believe AT&T is and always planned to be heading towards with the aquisition of DTV. Another great video @BusinessCasualYT. Nostradomus out.
AT&T acquiring Time Warner will not make them a larger broadband provider as that portion of the business was already sold off to Charter.  They would only be acquiring the media portion of Time Warner.
Phillipp Reis
Funny how the government complains about monopolies but protects The US Postal Service
As an ex Worldcom/MCI/Orange employee let me tell you that these organizations are run by absolute CUNTS
I have watched all your videos, but I had to stop this one mid way through. Please stop using the moving blue line, Its nauseating.
Pls make Kawasaki: The company behind motorcycles
Do NVIDIA next!
i'm a little surprised that you didn't mention Cingular.
Hey wait, thats not an answering machine at 7:00, its a wire recorder.
Wait... So AT&T is actually rebranded SDC and it sold most of its assets but remained in the network industry and made a huge chunk money, right?
I SMELL FAKE NEWS: How the Americans like to believe Bell invented the phone.. he stole the idea of Reis by requesting his research from the university.
Amazing video as always! Do SpaceX or OpenAI next!
That felix cameo though
I just realized I watched a slideshow.
Is it laggy for everyone?
9:21 I thought Sprint bought Nextel and Verizon bought Alltel?
5:34 this is WW1 no ?

Maybe do Philips soon? The lightbulb manufacturer that makes MRI and CAT scans.
For now, we just have to wait.\n\nFor now, we can only wait.\n\nBecause we can't do anything anywa.
lol learned their lesson kind of a stupid thing to say
Time Warner was formed when Time inc merge with Warner communication. Then they merged with Aol and mad Aol Time Warner but then they spun off Aol in 2009 They used to own Warner Music, Group,Warner Books,Time Warner Cable,Aol and Time inc
You should do a video on Compaq Computers
AT&T built it but was bought out by Southwestern Bell Communications. Who knew.
Thanks for the video, you deserve 1M subs. This could be a show on the History Channel.
You're infringing on my copyright pay-tint!
My grandmother worked for Bell South.
Please make a video about Playboy!
you forgot to talk about cingular
Isn;t TimeWarner owned by Charter now?
Soooooo that is what AT&T stands for O:!!!!
Tab for a Cause donates every time I open a new tab? I could bring Puerto Rico back on it's feet just from when I browse porn.
Great work! I learned a lot!
8:15 _Liar!_\nWe all know that was intended.
Would love for you to have incorporated the AT&T copper mines in Chile and the Kissinger memo urging for US intervention.
You are awesome Business Casual!! Loved this video :) Could you make one video about TV broadcast companies like Cable TV/Dish TV etc?
I'm going to see this again I didn't catch it all, at all.
i just found your channel I love it already
Please do Mitsubishi Motors & maybe electric please!
Thumbed up regardless of my views.
I like your videos. You're cool.
What about Virgin? Planes, trains, mobiles and megastores...
I hate at&t
What about Cingular
Do one on Carlos Slim and Claro!
By the way, Antonio Meucci is the real inventor! the others stole it.
OH MY GOD FELIX AT 10:16
Did J.P. Morgan just invest in or buy anything he could?
I also live in Orlando, Florida & I have Fiber Internet provides by AT&T for a good price. But here they do have to compete with Spectrum Cable as well.
Ayy fuck Americans we don't have any of these
technically bell canada is the real company behind the phone since it is the only division left of the original bell
Apart from the third party operators out there, one familiar to those my age is GTE (General Telephone), whose service differed greatly from Bell/AT&T as they had to have their own phones and wires.  Don't forget before 1984, Bell was the only company to manufacture their own phones that customers could only pay to have installed in their homes.  You just don't go out and buy an extra phone as it didn't work that way.  That all changed after the breakup and we started to see a lot of cheaply-produced phones out on the market.  Bell System phones (made by Western Electric) were heavy and practically unbreakable like tanks. \n\nGetting back to GTE, they mostly serviced specific areas Bell wasn't it, usually rural/suburban.  My grandma had GTE where she was and I can remember the odd noise the dialer made and the rings itself.  I'm sure this all had to do with those  specific patents AT&T had.\n\nIt should be noted, outside of DirecTV, AT&T also has it's own broadband service including DSL and a cable TV service called U-Verse in a number of markets they do operate landline phone service in (like the former Ohio Bell in my state).
10:16 Traps will not divide us...
I might start using his tab for a cause, I have between 80 and almost 200 tabs opened. And once I check them all I'll end up opening more anyway.
Dude Im I'm class.\n\n\nScrew class im watching this
I'm enjoying the hidden felix's
Invented the telephone\nAlexander Graham Bell
That Russian accent though.
It's like that returd, larry page, and his bullshat google fiber. It was DOA. comcraps and the rest own the internet and will not let you join, and fiber costs a fkload to lay and is impractical except for BUSINESS use, like internet2 at 100Gb/s.
This video naturally overlooks a lot of history in order to keep the video relatively short.  For example, people often claim that landline phone service was a natural monopoly, because how efficient would it have been to run multiple, competing phone lines?  While that certainly pointed to a difficulty early phone companies had, it doesn't really make it a natural monopoly,  Instead, the companies were working out agreements to share the phone lines, so that multiple lines weren't necessary.  Bell Telephone, however, successfully argued the natural monopoly argument to local legislators, and got them to grant local monopolies to phone companies, and Bell, being the biggest phone company at the time, was well-positioned to receive most of those government-granted monopolies.\n\nAnd, in fact, national telecommunications in the U.S. was nationalized, if only briefly:\n\nIn 1918 the federal government nationalized the entire telecommunications industry, with national security as the stated intent. Rates were regulated so that customers in large cities would pay higher rates to subsidize those in more remote areas. Vail was appointed to manage the telephone system with AT&T being paid a percentage of the telephone revenues. AT&T profited well from the nationalization arrangement which ended a year later. States then began regulating rates so that those in rural areas would not have to pay high prices, and competition was highly regulated or prohibited in local markets. Also, potential competitors were forbidden from installing new lines to compete, with state governments wishing to avoid duplication. The claim was that telephone service was a natural monopoly, meaning that one firm could better serve the public than two or more. Eventually, AT&T's market share amounted to what most would regard as a monopolistic share.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_AT%26T\n\nThe history of phone service in the U.S. would have been very different if government intervention hadn't occurred.
I think you guys made a mistake at the end... AT&T is indeed trying to buy Time Warner, the entertainment company, but not Time Warner Cable, so them acquiring Time Warner has nothing to do with broadband or internet.
5:29.  No way, anime girl.  This show isn't stupid at all
Can You Do Nickelodeon Or Cartoon Network?
lazy animations...unsubscribed.
nice anime at the big bang xD notice me sempai. yes traps are gay are gay not the old word for jolly
12 I'm early
At least here in Ohio, Time Warner had been bought out by spectrum instead of at&t.
Jamie! When you use baby facial for the first few times mix 2 pumps of the facial with 2 pumps of the oil. It adds extra hydration to the peel and makes it more balancing and your skin will be super soft. It also makes it a little more comfortable too. I'm obsessed with it and actually use it 2x a week religiously, but I had to work up to that. \nAlso, you just don't want to use anything with AHA/BHA/retinol/enzymes immediately after washing Baby Facial off. But surrounding days you def can. DE also recommends using the Marula oil after rinsing baby facial. \nI would do baby facial on Sunday, TLC 1-2x a week and maybe rotate in moonfruit 1-3x a week. I'm a Skin Lead at Sephora and highly recommend all the things you bought 😊
I think am cheap but I think that $6 for 1 mask is not  affordable
For UK people who can’t get sephora - the body shop do an amazing dupe for the drunk elephant baby facial! the vitamin C glow revealing liquid peel 🤓 you use it in the same way and it makes all your dead skin cells ball up and come off when you rinse it. it’s only £18 too, i swear by it 🙊
love u bye

Can you do an updated skin care routine video please?
Does any fellow UK pals know where I can get the Drunk Elephant TLC BabyFacial??? I’ve looked EVERYWHERE
about time you started a petition for sephora in glasgow you are the voice of the scottish people, pls and thanks x
OMG I never realise that there was no Sephora in the UK! 😱
I NEED A TRIP TO SEPHORA! LIKE NOW! Who wants a trip to the USA? I need an enabler 😂😂😂😏
Hey Miss JJ, what foundation are u wearing, looks amazing !
Make up tutorial on this please Jamie, I love the olive green! Xx
Jamie, I just love you! You have quickly become my favorite YouTuber. You are so real and down to earth. I love that you also represent the tattooed and pierced girls out there. You are beautiful! 😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️
Please do a makeup tutorial on this makeup, thanks
I arrived back from New York this morning for the for the first time in america! I spent $800 in Sephora 🙈😂 I was like a kid at Christmas 😂😂 I’m now bankrupt!! X
How many did u roughly spend all together
For those of you who are old enough to remember, there used to be a Sephora on Oxford Street, London years ago but closed down. There are talks one will be opening in Westfield East London soon, shame it won't be in Central London like Covent Garden which is like Beauty Central. Whoop x
We need a tutorial on this eye look please Jamie, you look bloody gorgeous girl 😘
Are you going to review the new kat von d palette???
Please do a first impressions/testing of that foot mask!!!
Hi Jamie, what product do you use to bring out your freckle? Thank you! You’re ace. 😘
It was not cheap but it was the last one, which make me think it was super necessary 😂😂😂 Thats so me.
Totally agree bring Sephora to the UK
You're camera quality is off the chain. Great vid, J. Thank you.
Tutorial on this look please, omg its amazing
Girl when I was in New York I was spending thousands! I git to VIB Rouge status in a week 🙈😂
Hey guys! Hope you're having a great day. I make videos about food and it would mean the world to me if you gave my channel a looking, lemme know what you think. Much love!
WE NEED SEPHORA IN THE UK😭😭
Im sorry but you look like the hotter Scottish version of Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner in some of your thumbnails
Jamie you can use the drunk elephant baby facial and the tlc framboos at the same time just not on the same day so use the baby facial on Monday and then the rest of the week use the tlc framboos (I work at Sephora)
Please do a tutorial on applying lashes 💖💖💖
That Baby Soft Foot Mask is CRA CRAAAAA! Your skin peels off!!
hey any smaller youtubers want to support each other? xo
You and kaushal are my favourite youtubers I think you should do videos together
Do a tutorial on this look!! I love it!
It's almost become a daily routine to sit and watch your videos whilst doing my makeup ❤️
Ugh so jealous of this haul 😭 if you just use the Sukari Facial every 1.5-2 weeks, you can still use the DE night serum or other AHA products in conjunction with it! You just need to make sure you stay away from actives 3-4 days before you use the Babyfacial. Just listen to your skin, if you are over exfoliating it will let you know!!
Ugh I want to try all this stuff! I need more money 😩
wish i could buy all this ughh hahaha
And you're still not hot 💀💀\n\n\n\n\n\nLMAO issa joke
Girl ya just HAD to go and post a huge haul on payday! Desperately praying for my bank balance 🙃
Liked before i even watched just because of the oops in the thumbnail 😂😂
I love that your hauls consist of so much skin care ❤️
It’s the farmacy products that came with the little spoon!
Yay yay yay! So happy a bigger YouTuber talked about Farmacy! I absolutely love that brand especially sleep tight and the honey potion moisturizer
please do a makeup collection x
Hey Jamie! Are you going to be dropping your teeth transformation video? Lots of love xM
Can you do a night time routine :)
hi Jamie!! I've seen you own the simple Human mirror...Do you like it for everyday make up?? I need one  and I would love to know your opinion!!\nthanks love, kisses from Spain
I think you can use the glycolic acid and the facial at the same time-- just not the same day. So, once your skin is used to it, I think you could use a schedule like this: TLC S-T-Th, facial F, rest Sat. (Although since they're both heavy AHA's that might be a lot of the same acid to put on your face... but you *could* is what I'm saying.) I do a similar schedule with lactic acid and a mandelic peel respectively, and my very chronically sensitive skin loves it.
Love you Jaime !!! Love that eye look, it's so beautiful!
Drunk elephant is such an amazing brand! For video ideas I still love the full face looks that you do, especailly when they're extra long. I'd love to see a classic bronze smokey eye from you. Those are my favourites to watch because everyone looks good in them
Please film the foot mask thing!
A fat stack of face masks 😂😂😂
I love getting your opinion on beauty products! Loved it xx
Her my face on her thumbnail made me click on it 😂😂😂like 😰
Jamie can you PLEASE do a review on the new Huda Beauty eyeshadow palette? I have seen so much controversy over it and I really trust and respect your opinions and honesty when reviewing products. Thanks love you xx
Your face in the thumbnail #canrelate 👌🏽
I remember when I was a kid and we had Sephora in the Uk- In London in Angel and Brent Cross. I guess they weren’t so successful at the time, but it was before blogging and YouTube ect really took off
Hey Jamie, would you be so kind as to do a basic gentle skin care routine from start to finish for newbies in this beauty world? :)
I love the Drunk Elephant Glycolic Serum, my skin has been so much better since I used it.
please do a vid about round eyes and a green eye makeup look. Also my eyeliner used to be perfect and its no longer awesome so a an eyeliner look where you really delve into semi-hooded eyes would be helpful. also please do a video on night skin care! love you Jamie! your the shit! I gather so much inspiration
I thought that said “Noon Fruit” hahahahaha
What eyelashes are you wearing in this vid? 😍😍
Wow your videos are blowwwing up lol I love it! I like the haul vids, for sure! Keep doing them! Could you do an updated brow routine (+ any tips with eyebrows that don't grow symmetrically, or up in the center? Weird but I can't figure it out and I just want your brows :( \n\nWould also love to see a NAF trip vlog! Always dope. \n\n+ your routine touch ups at your favorite place :)))) 👄
Please do a makeup tutorial on your Vegas make up look and your dark eye when you were on the plane the 2nd time!!
A good dupe for the drunk elephant baby facial is the body shop drops of youth liquid peel. Does exactly the same thing but is only £18. So gross but so satisfying at the same time !
am I the only one who got ASMR from 15:43
Please do a tutorial on this eye look!
I wish you could come to New Mexico and do my makeup for my husbands return from deployment! You are so incredibly stunning & talented!
Could we have a tutorial on your eye look?? I love the green and wud love to know WHICH shadows you used 😃❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I wish drunk elephant was just a smidge cheaper. I've heard such great things about their products!!

I've become such a huge fan of yours . Everything about you is so real and classy . Your skills are insane and completely beautiful #girlcrushjng
The thumbnail made me lol!!!!
I’m so jealous! I wish I could drop that much money on Sephora 😍 that would be a dream haha
You said it rite the first time is said bosha and the feet mask is amaze balls it works very very well!
I live in the Netherlands and there's also no Sephora here! Seriously, Sephora step up your game and come to more European countries!!
I really like hauls like this so I'd love to see more! I also feel like it's time for another skincare routine 🙌🏼 xx
Omg Jamie, please do a tutorial/review on the rubber mask!!❤️
Did sephora GIVE YOU a gift card to use for this purchase? case that makes all the difference.
What are you wearing on your lips, it's gorgeous! Also, love that eye look!

my girlfriend suggested I watch this video because she really just adores you, so I did. I almost cried towards the end thats all I have to say I'm not going to lie. BUT..... I'm also a huge fan of quotes and that one just made it to my top 3. So, when you are making your custom necklaces or whatever DONT FORGET ABOUT THE MEN or just make me a leather bracelet or something because i think I'm going to live by that quote now it really touched me.

Congrats .....Well done girl your so entertaining and I really like your diy videos:)
Since the beginning I was hooked! True story, I was revamping a bar cart and wanted to add marble to it and somehow I found your marble floor DIY.... literally was so hooked with your personality at that moment. I Remember, for some reason scrolling down to see if you were a popular youtuber that maybe I didn't know of, and was so shocked you only had like 100,000 subscribers or something. anyways, I didn't even finish my project that day, I just stayed in and binge watched all of your older videos. Since then I could never miss one. LOVEEEE YOUU! You deserve this and so much more <3
This made me cry a little I love u amber I'm happy for you I will continue to keep liking your videos
You may not have cried this time, but i definitely did!!!
I've been here since her 1k subs and honestly Amber deserves it all and I fucking hope she marries a millionaire because she's the most genuine YouTuber !!!
Wow very inspiring luv, Congrats you worked so hard for this you deserve it.

As one who subscribed to you when you where at 8k, I can say that I am so proud of you. No one could be that amazing, talented  and fun to watch when it comes to you Amber. Even if I'm a 15 year old boy who won't get to wear all these stuff, I still love to watch it, as long as you do it! And on to the next million, Kisses <3

I'm usually not the happy sad emotional kind of girl when it comes to Youtubers, but when I watched this video and saw the quote What if it doesn't come true? Ah, but what if it does? I lost it. Dreams do come true, and this is such a prime example of it. I love this!

Currently going through a tough time and not having the best week, but your good vibes literally radiated through this video and made me smile. Thank you ❤️😊
Please make a how I make my Persian rice video 😭
Not a bad life, Amelia.  Not bad at all!
I love how she did your brows.
In the beginning Amelia reminds me of Robin Williams in Mrs.Doubtfire when she dips her face in the soup and its drooping off of her face so she wont blow her cover 😂😂
I like the eyeliner she did on you !! It’s not so thick , and it flatters you eye shape . 🤗
No disrespect to Ms. Tibury but I prefer the way you do your makeup. :) You really know how to transform your already gorgeous face!
sorry for being nosey but why are you all taking a dna test? i could really feel your positive vibes haha loved it x
Lol at 7:13-7:15 the guys in the background
Pretty pink flowers speak to me too Amelia, I completely understand haha
Congrats Amelia, I am so happy for you! 4 years ago I bought my first pillowtalk lip liner after your recommendation and I loved it! Since then I have repurchased over and over again! I recently bought the very victoria & pillowtalk lipstick and I fell in love with her matte formulas! Same happened with her light wonder foundation, sooooo good and natural looking! Every product I have tried from her makeup and skincare line in full size or in a sample version, I ended up  loving it and buying it! She does her best and deserves all the praise for that! I wish there were more people so passionate and dedicated to their job like her! By the way, I watched the entire video you did with her and you were adorable! You deserve all this success Amelia!
I love the Dior tour🙋
Does anyone know where she got the peony pic? So gorgeous!
OMG you always look so glamorous! I literally just walked my dog in unicorn onesie pajamas LOLOL <3 xx
even without makeup you look so lovely!
Pretty pink peonies def speaks to me too 😂
Amelia..I love your blogs and your little dog..You are the best and so lucky to go to all these beautiful places I can only dream of.🐶
oh so fun of you singing on the car
i love j adore sooo much...i have 3 perfums ,,,jadore is wonderful
11:02 Duke, the Gremlin haha <3
Really loving your vlogs lately xx
Love how excited you were prior to meeting Charlotte! Beautiful outfits as always ☺️ Xx
The whole time you were talking in that face mask I was laughing so hard. You're hilarious, lady! 😂
I LOOOOVEE so much your vlogs !!!\nyou inspire me to do some too\nlike a parisian version lol
When you told about the Dior house, i thought woow Amilia has such a pretty voice!! \nAnd who's your dutch friend?
I saw Fanny in the blogggg <333333 love herrr omg she's slaying and she didn't even know she was on camera 17:20
Such an amazing trip with Dior! Everything looked so beautiful!
Such a special month!!! ☺️🙌🏼🙌🏼⭐️ everything was beautiful!!!
❤️❤️❤️
The face mask thou hahahahahahha :D
Duke waiting for that treat though!!!!! lol if he were my dog and was that cute, he would be fat on treats
I just love watching your videos... you are so full of life..😍
What are konkers (sp)?
17:19 Fanny Bourdette in the background 💜
Your awesome ❤️
Love this!
The  fields 😍
Thank you for sharing so much about the Dior trip-so lovely and amazing. And your 👗 was so so pretty
the design of house is timeless
U r such a darling love u so much. I feel lots of positivity from just watching u alone. And I recommended ur channel to many of my friends I knew. Lots of love from Singapore 😘👱🏻‍♀️❤️
What is the name of that type of rice? The mum-made rice, its the same type of rice Amelia has made in other videos! What is it called? I really want to try making it... it looks so good!
The dress you wore to the dinner was so pretty. Just perfect for the occasion. I love Jasmine. My niece wore a Jasmine headdress in her wedding in India and it was beautiful.
Karaoke in the car! Fun times!!
That Dior mascara was wow!  J'adore is one of my favorite fragrances.  I can't wait to get a whiff of the new one.
what lipstick is this? i love
Ahhh you are good for the soul Amelia😊
Amelia I couldn't stop laughing by the end of it with your face mask 🤣 by the way you looked so pretty when CB did your makeup! The foundation/ contouring looked amazing as well . You always look gorgeous anyway. Loved the video ❤️
I feel like for every time I've had my hair done you've had yours redone about 5 times 😫 haha x
The more you talked the more that face mask deteriorated 🤣
Loved your vlog 😍😍 What nail polish are you wearing? Lots of love ❤️
I prefer the way you do your own make up. You are gifted at elevating subtlety, be it with color, style, jewelry, outfits, etc....you don't need experts---you are gifted, and you need not be intimidated by othersd, Amelia. You are elegant, refined, kind, loyal, and I wish you lots of joy and blessings.❤️
I was just laughing my a** off seeing you with the face mask on! So funny 😂
Giiir what are your glasses when you were driving from?????? ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
What's the name of the blusher Charlotte used on you, it looked great!
Amelia you are so lovely!! But the yellow sunglasses are just well, NO :D :D
Girl the dior chateau was a dream 😁
Duke is the most adorable puppy I've ever seen! What breed is he?
What’s conker? Chestnut?
apparently they dont test on animals but arnt vegan?
Amelia you look amazing darling!!!!!!😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘Charlotte is just such a sweetheart I'm sure you where on cloud9 best wishes from Ireland 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
I love that black Chanel at the salon you had. Updated bag collection please?
I feel so happy to see that you are happy Amelia!
19 kilos is nothing - that suitcase weighs like 18 on its own!  So beautiful, but so heavy. I bought the (not as pretty) lightweight version because I could barely pick that one up 😂
You looked SO pretty in that but dress at Dior....<3
This was such a good video. It's always a treat to see Duke & Dior's house is fantastic. Thanks
Dior's house looked divine! What an adventure <3
LMAO at your face mask at the beginning! every time you jump cut, it just keeps sagging lower and lower. Legit burst out laughing at 2:33 xoxo
Love Charlotte! can you please post the link to the coat you are wearing whilst walking Duke? the one above isn't working. Thanks
What's a conca?? A chestnut???
You make me feel so energetic . You are always cheerful
Okay love your hair color 10x more now. I liked it before but now...it's perfect!
If she is Charlotte  u r Amelia  u r really  one of best  make  up  bloggers  🙂
I don't know what happened with youtube but your video was not in my subscription box. Am I the only one?
the bit where you're talking about conkers with that mask on was so funny because you looked so crazy lololol
In my opinion you do better your makeup because of the way she applied the eyeshadows. The eyeliner she did look strange on you and there was too much transición shadow
I love your earrings Amelia! Where did you get them?
The tour of Dior's home was magnificent! Thank you so much for sharing that beauty with us! I'll have to go back and pause it to really study the rooms. So much to see in a split second!
omega i love your chanel!!! is it a recent purchase? xxx
I love love the highlighter on you. It's making me want to buy it
Such an honor having Charlotte Tilbury do your makeup! You look fabu!
You singing along to Taylor swift in the car is literally me driving home tonight
I think thats the first time Amelia has ever sworn in a video and I had to do a double take on that! Great video!
You talking with that face mask on, had me howling!! 😂
Wow, what a video, you seem to have a charmed life this month. You look and sound amazing, really enjoyed this video.
just curious as to what you do when  there is food at an event. do you tell them your restrictions or just eat some if it?
Why always some judging people are here? They always tell her wht to do about her fashion lens makeup and even life! They should know they bother Amelia and some peop who enjoy her vids.
Wait what is a conker??
You're living a fairytale right now. So happy for you I hope it lasts forever. \nLiterally goals ❤❤
So exciting, thank you for sharing. PLEASE can you share your 23andme DNA results? The results are always so interesting! xx
I 100% only started driving for the singing in the car!
This is what living your dream looks like💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
The food looked amazing! please can you share the salad & rice recipes?
That ghemeh bodamjoon looked pretty good though! If that's how you spell it 😂😂
An hour late for an engagement party! The Persian in you is showing!
wtf is a conker..... british ppl are crazy
Ooooh!  I was like, conkers?  What the f is a conker?  So I looked it up & learned something new about horse chestnut seeds & a game in Britain!  (I'm from 'merica.)  The more you know!....✨🌈
Hello! Lovely video! \nWhere is your peony wall picture from? Thanks x
Where is the gorgeous picture/poster of the pink peonies from? \nLove it 😍😍😍
The print is really terrible. Basic is a compliment
Hi Amelia.\nJust want to let you know dr Josh axe's youtube video was talking about how to get rid of SIBO naturally.\nIf you never seen it maybe you can take a look. \nHope you will get well soon!\n\nBest wishes
Calling 911: hello- doctor...DOCTOR....O.o DOCTOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

Plzzz
Love u
Poppy Clone
She hot
What the fuck is this random shit
This i ever so creepy.
This is creepy.
literly every episode of keeping up with the kardashians
Soon the Poppy tour will begin, and the album Poppy.Computer will be released. Many important events for Poppy and her fans. There is very hard to perform on the tour: a lot of concerts are big stress for artists. You will have to give a lot of your energy to a lot of people from different cities of the whole continent. I wish you a spiritual recovery, a sense of delight from what is happening, lot of love. \nI think this is the first step on the way to the World Poppy Show, I hope someday I will attend your live performance.
Popy is my best fried i like her
Fuck you

stop making these videos you fucking weirdo
Avalon 737sp. One must never forget the legacy Neumann has created as well. But without Studer and Ampex, it never would have been as successful as the medium wouldn’t have grown in fidelity. And you didn’t mention the groundbreaking design of the Unidyne III element that made Shure legendary with the 545, 565, SM57, SM58, SM5, SM7b. And Electro Voice’s Variable D that minimizes proximity effect with the venerable and ever present RE20. This is a rather incomplete history of microphones to get so many views. Not only are there dynamic and condenser microphones, but also tube microphones and ribbon microphones. Different polar patterns. Frequency response and sensitivity. Condensers require 48 volts phantom power. Good preamps such as Neve and API, as well as Midas and SSL and the Avalon mentioned earlier.
i can't wait for little doe to return so i can ruin my bank balance and support your shop!! you make the most beautiful jewellery <3
Kiera, I absolutely adore your makeup in this video!!! You look gorgeous!\nAlso we're the same personality type! Woooo
I love you to pieces Kiera, both inside and out you are beautiful! I am truly sorry for Lou bean going to heaven! he's with his brothers now :'( I totally understand the need for a break and to gather ones thoughts and take stock, keep up the wonderful things that you do...you bring so much beauty to the world xxx
So sorry about Louie. I have a very sick rattie who is over 2 years old and I'm thinking she's not going to be with me much longer.
It seems that I'm behind the times.  So sorry to hear about Louie!  Hope you're doing alright.
Florence!!!!!!!!
Commit to a medusa!!!! They are beautiful ❤️
I'm getting my medusa 13th October xD and yeeees you should get it medusa are so beautiful  (sorry for my English I'm so tired xD )
Omg Lou Lou bean :( I'm so sorry to hear that, I literally cried my eyes out when you told us that and grabbed my boys and smooshed em. You are such a caring and wonderful person and changed to many people's opinions about ratties with your gorguz ratty boys. God bless
Hi Kiera, really sorry to hear about losing your little rat butt, I just found a lump on my oldest today and dreading anything happening to him. \nMy question would be advice on starting a business. I started Crafty Little Studio early 2017 but relaunched and changed crafty completely September 1st. The advice would be amazing! \nI do illustration, design and photography but I'm looking to include ceramics in a few weeks once my kiln gets placed in my studio and diy projects. \nThank you for your wonderful self, you've helped inspire me to open my own business with your YouTube channel over the years xxx
So sorry about Louis. I had to put down my old lady cat about two months ago. It's tough.
love your videos! such an inspiration. sorry for your loss :(
My sister had dougal and the blue cat on record and I was traumatized at the sound of dougal crying and the blue cat being mean!!! Even the thought of it 🙈🙈🙈🙈 xxx
I love how you called fantastic 4 'fantfourstic' 😂😂
don't get the medusa!!! I think it would look pretty but the scar/hole that it would leave would be in such a noticeable place
How can we find your eBay? Xx
Aww bless Louis x hope you're alright :( 💞💞💞 but thankfully your last video was with him which is beautiful :)
Your make up is studding! You should make a tutorial on it
I've done so many Meyers Briggs tests and I always get INFP as well! :-)
omg you answered my question! thank you so much :))) x
So sorry to hear about Louis 💔 you gave him and all your rats such good lives! And it's nice that you did that video where you got some of his pawprints, so you have something to remember him by ❤❤
I'm INFP also, apparently we're pretty rare ;)
Kiera, would you pass the butter please?
are you getting any more rats?? xx
Okay. I have a min pin that’s name is Sophie that looks exactly like your little stuffy!! to a tea! \nLove the rick and morty reference at the end 😂😂😂
I've been watching you for yeeaaaars now, waaay back in your ScarletSaint days, and to find out that you love Florence and the machine too is well cool! Florence Welch speaks to me on a spiritual level, she has an incredible voice!🖤
I'm so sorry for your loss, Kiera. I can only imagine how you must feel. I have two rabbits, named Darwin (I named him after your Darwin, he was my fave ratty!) and Daisy :). Darwin has had some medical problems in the past year or so and I cry just at the thought of losing him. They've both helped me so much with my anxiety and depression, it's unbelievable. Fur babies are the best, and even though it's a shame they're with us for such a short time, we should consider ourselves lucky for being able to spend so many precious moments by their side <3
Good luck to you babe . You will be strong and this pain will fade away over time to be replaced with a happy heart for all the great memories you spent together.\nLexi
💖 Ahah! We listen to the same music. So glad! 💖\nHope the little souvenir of Louloubean's painting will help in the loss of this sweet lil'thing.\nxx
When you said Fant 4 Stic I laughed really hard because i use to call Fantastic 4 that when I was younger
A medusa would look fab on you I had one a few years back one of the easiest piercings to look after in my opinion - had to take it out for work :'(
You should do a video with highlights from the team beam store x)
Hi Keira, I'm sorry for your loss, I can only imagine the pain you and Alex went through. Your boys warmed my heart and made me love ratties and mice (wich I already loved but didn't know could be such amazing pet friends) and thanks to you all back in April I got two little mice which I love with all my heart. I can never thank the Bean family enough for that. Btw you both ROCK and are as strong as only a bean can be! We subscribers are all with you and we can't wait for you next amazing videos 💕
We're the same personality type! I always connect so much with people who are the same type as me, it's nice to understand why I like your channel so much! I'm excited for little doe to launch, are you going to do more jewellery, like rings and bracelets?
You should watch Nasty Gal on netflix.. or is it amazon. It is really cool and could totally be you with thrifting!
I'm an INFP too! I always thought you were :)
Just do it! I got an Ashley piercing last month and I love it! 😍😙
That blue cat was actually the stuff of nightmares! Haha
I feel your pain, my pup of 13 years just passed away yesterday, I can't believe it, and I find myself expecting to see her come around the corner, and then I remember that she's gone...it's the hardest thing ever. \nSo my heart hurts for you, sending you lots of love.
I've been following you since your first adventures with the beans. I got two of them at the same time actually and that's why I found your channel! I got into a depression and didn't watch much YouTube or go on Instagram or anything and then I came back and saw how many beans you've lost. I knew it was inevitable but it still sucked to see you sad. I almost mourned with you, because I lost mine at the same time. I don't know where I'm going with this but to say I'm sorry and even I'm the worst of times, know you have a support system.
I'm so sorry to hear about Lou :c I can't imagine.... It's always hard losing a pet because to us they're not our pets they're our family our children our best friends.. May Lou rest peacefully.
idk... a medusa is so front and center
I just got my medusa and I am so happy! I have my septum pierced too. I will say that the medusa didn't hurt as bad as my septum but you do feel that needle more moving through your skin lmao. I even got both my nostrils pierced when I got my medusa. Nose hurt me more than the lip piercing. You would look gorgeous with the medusa <3 Sending love to you for the loss of your ratty babe <3
I just about died at I pass butter xD
I'll share my own opinion on the piercing ONLY cause you asked for feedback. When someone has such a beautiful face AND amazing makeup and hair abilities, piercings just take away from it. I don't like them. They never make someone look better imo. At least with a septum, you can not wear it and the hole isn't visible. The lip one--probably not so much.
In a very similar position - four ratties to none. They do leave a hole but you'll always have given themthe bestlives they could have asked for x (edit- god yes get that piercing )
Woooo! welcome to the Mediator Group! I know its not real science or anything, but i love this kind of shit. That site particulary, i really enjoyed. I read through the entire Mediator pages and descriptions and ive never seen a personality description so apt. Of course its not 100%, but some of the things it go t right were so right, like in ways i never had the words for before. I was quite impressed.
holy I'm an infp-t as well! Do you ever feel like you're an empath? Whenever I meet other infp's, I've found that we tend to be extremely empathic <3
I’m so sorry about Louis 💕 sending lots of love.
I love your passion for making genuine videos that you want to make, without having to worry about views etc :) I can't wait until you have your business up and running. 🌈 All the best to you and Alex 💜
Get your Medusa!! It'll look awesome on you!
also get your medusa pierced! it would look amazing!!! i would have got mine already but my job doesn't allow it :( your very lucky that you can have all the tattoos and piercings you like! so doo eeeet
I made the test a few days ago and i am a mediator, too. I really get you and how you just want to do little doe. you are so passionate about it and I am absolutely in love with his. \nAnd a medusa would look really cute on you.
lovely babycakes, Im so sorry about Louis. that's all I wanna say<3
You were an amazing rattie mummy and they loved you tons! Huge hugs my lovely x
Second comment, but if you do the ebay charity thingie with thrifted items If you find any could you list plus size finds? I would love to have a browse but I'm like a 18 or 16 on a good day :)
Hope you're okay and sorry about little Louie. Least you have happy memories of them all and have the videos and pictures of them that you did :) they'll always be in you're heart and always be around as little spirit beans 💙
so sorry to hear about your precious  bean, its so hard to cope with. Please please please dont get your gorgeous hair cut it looks amazing .My hair is the same length and colour but sadly doesnt look as amazing as yours.Sorry but i think a piercing above your mouth will drive you nuts, especially when eating or talking, love your videos , really look forward to them, love to you and alex
i have my nose septum and medusa and i love all of them i think it would suit you so much! Xx
I'm so sad to hear about Louie ❤ I had two girl mice with my boyfriend, and they were my everything. (We even bought a real Swarowski mouse on a vacation, because it reminded us of them, lol) The first one (Makker) had to be put down a year ago this summer, and her sister (Bakker) had to be put down a year ago this November coming up. I had to take 3 days off work BOTH times because everything made me cry. It might sound so dramatic, but honestly, I still can't look at pictures of them or even talk about them for too long without crying to this day. It annoys me so much, because I would LOVE to relive all the good memories we had, but I just can't yet. Even telling this is making me emotional. I just wanted to say that I'm so terribly sorry about what you are going through, but as you said youself; you know he had a great life. ❤❤🐁 much love from Denmark.🌟
Because of you I got three pet ratties called Greg, Oscar and Alfie. They’re 3 months old now and I’m in love with them, they have bought me so much happiness! I’m so sorry about your loss, they do only live a short time :( x
We have the same music taste 😍 you named all my faves 💕 love you and hope all is well 🌿✨
I know that seeing my goals in practice with other people really helps me achieve them because I can visualise them better. If you're like me and would find this useful, you should check out Christine Kobzeff's channel. She makes jewelry as a full time job, employs her husband, and goes to outdoor markets and fairs regularly to sell (but also to go flee market shopping!)
i love your The Room references so much, oml
I'm so sorry for your loss honey I hope that it gets easier <3 I love your make up and your top in this video could you do a tutorial on the eye look? xx
Love Hozier! So sorry to hear about Lou 😢
I'm so excited you answered my question! Love your videos, they're always so calming :)
I felt really sad about Lou :c hope you get well love ur videos <3 !
I love your widow's peak!
I also have a poser clock. I use to use it but then the ticking started driving me CRAZY so I had to take the batteries out. Now it just sits on my night stand looking pretty and gathering dust 😂
Btw as someone who works as a part of the CITV scheduling team I can assure you that grizzly tails and my parents are aliens are still frequently shown on that channel. Let's all get nostalgic ;) absolutely adore you Kiera <3
It's good to see you again! <3
MY GOD, YOU ARE ADORABLE! Thanks for your beautiful video and beautiful thoughts. <3
OMG OMG OMG... Okay, so Kiera Rose just answered my question in one of her videos... I can see unicorns now
Oh my gosh yes Dougal and the Blue Cat!! Finally someone else who knows what this is. Thank you 😊
LOL the Johnny and Rick and Morty edits <3 Hope you're doing well and YES PLS to the medusa!
I used to cry as a child when I realized my pets would eventually die 😢
COMMIT! You can take it out if you hate it. It'll be nice! :3
*hugs- I totally understand your feelings with Lou Bean. ): I spent almost the whole week before Kari had to be pts crying because I just knew the surgery didn't work and there was nothing left to be done, because hand feeding just wasn't helping. UGH now I'm tearing up. lol\n\nI honestly don't blame you for skipping the if you'll get more question (be it you meant to or just didn't see it). I currently still have 3 and have lost 3, in the same three years PLUS 4 I took in to help after Hurricane Harvey. I'm honestly wondering if I really want more after this or not...\n\nI will forever love rats but between the loss and heart break, we're also finally taking the steps to get our first home and save towards the wedding (and to go to a friend's wedding across the country!), I just don't know if I would be able to take on more after this. v.v
I’m an INFP too!
I'm so sorry for your loss Kiera. I always enjoyed your rat videos a lot and they're are the reason I found your channel! Much love and stay strong x
I pass butter... Every time I think I couldn't love you any more... 😂
love u bean ❤️
QOTSA!💓
your eyeshadow looks amazing!
Medusa !!! Definitely
Rip Louis🐀😢💙
you should really get your medusa pierced!!!
Yes commitment
DO IT! DO IT! DO IT! (medusa piercing)
I'm INFP toooooooo!!! 💕💕💕
Definitely get a medusa piercing!!!!!
im sorry about your loss :/ i hope you feel better 💛 // p.s. im an ENFP!! so cloooose hahah
Eyelash glue a little screw top/ ball top piercing to your lip and test if you like a medusa
After I lost all my ratties I thought I would never want to be a little fuzzy mum again, then I rescued a ferret :| ( the charity was going to kill him because no one wanted him ). I have never looked back, he's such a character, and so so funny. Just a thought.
Idk if you've had mouth piercings before, but I wouldn't  recommend it if you don't see yourself committed to it. Not that it wouldn't look good on you, but it can scar your face permanently
I'm so sorry for your loss 😔 I lost my rat Lewis a month ago, and I know his brother Boris doesn't have much longer left. It's horrible having to deal with type of stuff. Why can't animals just live forever you know? But anyways I'm sending good vibes your way ❤
Can you please post a link to your ebay?
so sorry to hear about little louis, at least he's with the other boys now 🌈💖 sending loads of love ur way. thank u for being such a fantastic rat mummy & giving these lovely boys a wonderful life 💕
Anyone know where her duvet cover is from? :)
Poor little Megyn. She can't hold a conversation. Why in the world does anyone think she can handle this sort of interview? So embarrassing.
It's inevitable, she's going to be kicked off. NBC, just save the time & money and do it now. She's nothing special and was only popular because Trump talked about her vaginal blood.
megyn is just so awkward.
Megyn Kelly sucks on morning tv.  Who asks about plastic surgery during an interview about a movie.  Her “gotcha” style interviews sucks and hurts the TODAY show brand. Stars are going to start boycotting appearances because of her
Really!??? That's what you're asking? Such a waste of time... can i ask you something Megan? Can you leave!? right now!
Megyn Kelly is horrible! I would never watch her show after seeing this!
Kelly is not a people person and has zero charisma. This interview is so awkward.
So ageist, so sexist. this was criiiiiiiiiiinge lol
cringe interview
Omg that question to Jane Fonda was so inappropriate and ill timed! Horrible horrible horrible! Megan is so bad at this job it's startling.
Megyn should quit this job....its just not for her....shes off topic
I can't believe MK had two of the greatest actors sitting right in front of her and decides to discuss plastic surgery! REALLY??? She's blowing her chances, you can't teach humility. Crash and burn...........
Megyn Kelly is the worst. How is it possible to be so thoughtless? Jane Fonda and Robert Redford are amazing and I wish she could have asked relevant questions. #losthope
The interviewer couldn't make it more awkward for these legends with her imbecilic questions
Is MK interested in anything  besides appearances and age????? How shallow! (and that's a kindness!)\nwhatever made someone hire her in this capacity ??? nearly brainless. And the audience as well, WHY would they populate the seats for a program like this?
Megan: Lose the f**king pen! IT's stupid
Megyn says it's a beautiful, beautiful film @ 5:00 and it sounds so disingenuous, she probably didn't even see it!!
Did anyone else feel like the question was really inappropriate? About plastic surgery? I mean really?
Queen Jane shoots down the vile Megyn Kelly. Take this witch back to the slime bucket that is Fox News.
LOL.. the fail is strong with this narcissistic blonde twit.
I thought she said Arseholes at Night ! ( it's the American accent, I'm a Brit)  Terrible interviewer and possibly the most insulting dumbest cringeworthy ageist questions she could ask ... these two legends. And yet they were still gracious . Wish someone would give them the time they deserve and a respectful interviewer
Jane Fonda got more class, brains and beauty today and always, than that intervier Megyn Kelly has.\nThe way Jane Fonda handled that interview was amazing considering it was a full on nasty cut-throat remark by Megyn Kelly.\nI'm with Jane Fonda all the way, and Robert Redford. Just amazing talented people.
I love how people their age don't give a f and say things the way they are. Lol
Megyn just doesn't have a clue.....smh. She's not going to be accepted by anyone before too long.
MEGAN KELLY TONIGHT!\nLAST SHOW\nCANCELLED AFTER 1 WEEK\nDUE TO VERY LOW REVIEWS
Jane Fonda did a wonderful job after that terrible question
megyn kelly really sucks...more and more...pretty amazing redford's gone from media recluse to showing up on day time chat shows...getting older made even the sundance kid come in from the cold...
Megyn Kelly is AWEFUL.
Horrible interview.
1:51 Really Megan Kelly That like Bryanstars level of Stupid questions i mean come on.
The only thing Megyn has going for her is her looks. She is terrible at interviewing. That is why her show is tanking.
it's amazing how when you only see a short clip about the plastic surgeon question, an impression is left with the viewer how inappropriate the situation was and how angry Jane Fonda was. However, when you watch the entire interview, it was really only a blink in the context of it all.
The only way a Megyn Kelly talk show could be anywhere near remotely entertaining  is if it involved her stripping down and showing off those floppy, whithered, 46 year old fun bags.\nREPLY
man, do they live in the past or what?
Redford has become so effeminate.   He has been a good actor and last saw him in A WALK IN THE WOODS  with Nick Nolte in 2015.
MK just can't stay in the moments.... interrogate off topic vs. appreciate now
hahHHA I AGED NORMALLY BUT ALSO HIT THEM INJECTIONS HAHA XD IM GOOD ACTOR
Megyn Kelly screwed up here.  But sometimes I get the feeling these liberal celebrities try to throw her off balance on purpose because of the fact that she came from Fox News (which they absolutely hate).
Megyn Kelley like most conservatives and Fox News anchors are tone deaf and just completely ignorant.
You know that something is seriously wrong with today's society when someone like Megyn Kelly is a somebody.
MK is not for daytime TV - she does not relate - she is a hard news person
I  would spit on Hanoi Jane heifer dog
Her show appeals to idiots. That's all
What a hack job Kelly did on both of them ... yuck!  no more Meghan Kelly
I think Jane looks great, nothing to be ashamed of. What's her surgeons name, lots of woman have had surgery and look it, jane looks pretty natural.
I just heard the next episode is going to be completely devoted to DIY tips to protect your family from the New Black Panther Party. You're doing gods' work Megyn!
She destroyed her career when she left fox...today show screwed themselves after paying millions for her😂😂 instant buyers remorse
She is trying its hard to overcome old habits fox news was and is the worst
women have nothing to offer other than their looks. they are all terrified of aging, its sweet justice for us men who have to watch them entitled and evil all their life
Please come back to Houston
It’s over Johnny
MK sorry, but can you drool over Redford even more?
Totally shocked by Megyn Kelly's announcement at 4.57.  It sounds like she is saying 'Arseholes at night'! Better to emphasise the second word ( 'Souls' ) instead of the first ('Our').
Jane was looking daggers at Megyn and rightly so.  Megyn was extremely rude, would she want to be asked about her hair extensions?   I've always liked Jane Fonda and am glad to see her and Redford together again in a sequel of sorts to Barefoot in the Park.  I don't recognize that electric horseman movie because it was so awful.
Almost every question had to do with age.  WTF!?  When the interviewees keep having to save the interview, you know that something's JUST NOT RIGHT.   Redford's right about Jane, she's amazing.
I feel bad for Fonda. She had to sit through an interview with this ignorant woman.
Age!!Age!!!looks!! AGE!LOOKS! MK IS OVER
Kelly is great...who doesn't love watching a clown, just waiting for the fool to show up.
never has there been two ego maniacs like Megyn Kelly and Jane Hanoi Jane Fonda pompous arrogant complete drones .  Redford that ship has come and sailed but still hanging on for some publicity and to be adored by the public.  PATHETIC !!!!!
Megyn Kelly already reached her peak of fame. It's all downhill from here.
i came here for Robert & Jane\n& then i saw  the cow\non the presidential debate \nit is her ?
Miss Kelly should just get off TV!!!!!
Megyn Kelly is no OPRAH. WHY is she so obsessed with Jane’s looks and body -_- she’s so fake. Trying to force feed us superficiality. She is spearheading ageism by constantly talking about Jane’s looks.
Megyn is forced and beating to her own drum at the expense of Fonda here. And also, why didn´t you ask Redford about his facelifts? Probably had as many as Jane has. Be a little self-critical about how you reproduce old stereotypes of women by the questions you ask. Not cool, sorry.
First the Will and Grace Snafu. Now this.\nYikes.
Cringing in embarrassment for Megyn. Why not askJane who she's looking forward to working with on the next project? Jane has class for miles!
Jane and Robert came to promote their new movie and Megyn consistently tried to take the conversation to any other topic besides the movie.  Strange way to do a movie-promo interview.  I can see why Jane was annoyed.  And Megyn still didn't take a hint.  She's got a big learning curve on how to do this kind of show.
Can't stand Megan Kelly, what a horrible interview
Awful host! She don't know how to listen to her guests...
Isn't this Megyn Kelly that person who claim that Jesus Christ was white and should only be showed as white? Isn't she the one who makes all types of excuses for police shooting of unharmed black people and claims that it has nothing to do with race.
Wow, they are still alive.
Show's not going to last !!!
This isn’t about you Megan!! Please ...
WORLDAASS NEWS.HAIL THE TODAY SHOW.HEALTHCAREAMERICA.COM ASK TRUMP IF.CLARENCE A WHITE.TODAY SHOW
why is the camera CONSTANTLY MOVING? distract from what's actually happening on screen maybe? BECAUSE IT SUCKS (the camera and the content). thanks
I just don't like Megyn.
I respect MK... but Barbra Walters she is not.
A communist and a hateful feminist walked onto a stage........and then I turned the t.v. off.

NBC's LATEST DISASTER: MEGYN KELLY 👎.
Megyn Kelly is trash lol
they look like mummies
Megyn sux! Poor thing
Bye Megyn.
MEGYN KELLY IS TERRIBLE. Awful. Awfully terrible!! Terribly awful. \nGo back to Fox News.
r/cringe
Megan Kelly malicious
Omg that was upsetting to watch
Hanoi Jane looks amazing...
JANE IS 😍😍
It seems like when you're older your age will be rubbed in your face whether it's in a form of compliments or not...Honestly it doesn't need to be constantly pointed out 🙄
Jane is funny.  She definitely likes to be the centre of attention with discussion pertaining to her or her co-star referencing her or them, even at her age.   Robert Redford has a good sense of humour.
She is a racist and a liar. I will never forget how you purposely inspired racist attacks with race baiting, calling black protesters thugs, saying that all Muslims are terrorists and  inciting people to commit hate crimes all over this nation. You and the rest of the propagandist at fox, both past and present, are covered in blood from all of the attacks and murders caused by your words. You cant hide from your past and who you really are. NBC are trying to normalize these people but DON'T LET THEM. DON'T WATCH ANY SHOW KELLY OR ANYONE WHO THINKS LIKE HER IS ON. SHAME!!!!!!
Jane Fonda just through complete shade...NAHH ..., she threw ABSOLUTE DARKNESS on this ignorant, moron, lawyer turned news anchor, turned entertainment host. Meghan,,dear,,,, CATS are the only creatures to boast about 9 lives, your DONE.
This dyed-blonde skank must be deported to Saudi Arabia ASAP.
I personally think MK did a great job, and I’m not even a fan.
Megyn Kelly will never be half the woman Jane Fonda is.  Not to mention the Integrity.
I think people or the media are making too big of a deal out of this part of the interview. Now that Ive seen it it just wasn't that bad.
If they want viewers they need edge, this is not edge, there is no edge on tv anymore!
Wait, so this is the second official video for this song? Damn he must love this song so much :/
#MEXICO🙋
French fan?
Since 2004 same man just upgrading 😘😜
james blunt you have an angel voice, just perfect
James has songs with the most beautiful lyrics. he's so underrated and its so sad seeing great Artists unrecognized anymore. But keep it burning, beautiful video as well love it.
it's not bad, but nothing will ever beat My Triangle!
Reminds me of Adam Lavine for some reason? Maybe the tone?
Heard this live last night. It was amazing 😍
Ethiopia fans💙💙💙☹️I like this song
Love..is when you hear James...
We miss u in South Africa. Pls co me again😭
🏈🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪

Why on the earth two videos for a song?
Love James since elementary school. His voice and music are both great.
Love this video, which tells a deeper story, and it is so so tragic.    😭😭😭\n\nJames Blunt is a pure artist.  Every song is genuine and from the heart.
Marvelous this album... fantastic Mr Blunt... !!!!
I loooove this song....not all songs, James is the best
Love it -  I love your music Mr Blunt <3

I'm confused why does the song has tow videos!!
For a moment there i though that this was the preview story of if time is all i have, amazing video <3 last part gave me chills
I was thinking dis' video could be more... dramatic// I mean, 4 da' lyrics, but good job 4 a very great song // this song remember me my situation: I love it but... I hate it
Elisangela, \nSul real, '?
The little girl is my cousin
This song is the only good in this album. Sorry James, but your last album is so different.
We still got some good Singers
Wow, James Blunt you’re so amazing and hopefully someone will do Remix soon could be great
Hope is the worst motherfucker out of Pandora's can.
This is FANTASTIC, Blunty. There’s a reason why this is one of my favorite songs on The Afterlove.
God bless your voice man!  love your songs!
I think I'd like to listen to his voice for the whole of my life ❤️
OmgI swear that I've cried. Stop to kill yourself in your videos!!
So are there 2 official videos?
Amazing video, the best. I was surprised and I was moved because by that james blunt is the best
I can't say no to you, James.
Great song. My favorite. James is the best.
Video gave me a whole new perspective at the song.

*Before my 100th birthday,* I need to find me some me-time to go and see him in concert.\n-\n*There is just no one like him!*  (I love James Blunt!)

WE HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY HAPPY LATE BIRTHDAY YOURE LITERALLY TWICE MY AGE I JUST TURNED 16
My birthday is on the 28
Hope everyone is safe and well after the socking events yesterday.
I can’t believe you’re 32. I feel like since I started watching your videos I thought you were in your mid to late twenties and I still think that!
I don't know why I could wait to get home and watch this
I love you. But you could’ve just done with one. Be grace.
Dick eating hoe diet consist 24 coves a night literally hit her up on tinder
Your hair looks at it's best!
HAPPY LATE BIRTHDAY GRACE! YOU MAKE ME SMILE, and I LIKE YOU A LOT.
I like your new hair, thought I don't know if it's new but it's new to me and I like it so there. Compliment achieved.
You are too funny! Happy Birthday, and as a former wrestler, I'm glad you converted!!!
If the blue night loses... I'll just die. me talking about any of my celebrity crushes
I feel like you already didn't know.
You and my son have the same birthday!
Your videos always make me happy, Grace!!
You should react to Daniel bregolis new songs !!!!!
4:56 - 5:06 I LOST MY SHIT!! I don't know if it's true or not but omg I havent laughed that hard in a while. The way she said it holy moly!!!
GRAVE IT MAKES ME SO HAPPY YOU LIKE WWE
we share the same bday 🙂 happy birthday to us
Here's a thing. I am also 32. yay....
Happy Birthday, Grace! Here's wishing that your year is incredible!
You're going to have THE BEST year of your life! Happy 32nd birthday awesome woman!
That last one tho! P.S. Wasn't Goose's former name Phoenix?
I'll be 32 this Halloween! Happy birthday Grace!
this is also a reminder of the segments grace has introduced and immediately abandoned
we have the same bday!
When I was 32 I went to Disney World for the fist time. Just saying.
Everyone needs a Grace Helbig in their lives, just sayin'.
Happy belated birthday!\n\nAlso, more Tim please. You two are so funny together. :)
HAPPY BIRTHDAY GRACE! GRATEFUL THAT YOU EXIST AND POST VIDEOS ON THE INTERNET FOR MY ENJOYMENT AND THAT YOU ARE VERY FUNNY AND FOR CAPS LOCK!!! <3<3
Goose's original name was Pheonix,  right?
Birthing rites...\n..impromptu rites cries the mental smells! \nBeer without hops...jumping for the spring...  :-)
You gotta love Grace
eyeliner is on POINT you go birthday girl
Ok 1. She looks fantastic for 32. She's always looked fantastic. 2. When she shotguns the beer or gives the handcuff secret away...what was up with her voice there?
I actually love your douchebag cousin.
Clip show with Grace!
My friends' started a youtube channel and got slime stuck in her hair during the 7 second challenge. Here's the link if you want to check it out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDC_2L6903Y&t=451s tysm!!!
belated happy birthday wishes :D Wish You all the Love and success in Your Life :D
You look amazing 😍 I thought you were like 25 or sommet 😱❤️
Your birthday is the day after mine. I love you. But not because of our birthday similarities
Welcome to the deepening pit of despair Helbig.
We have the same birthdaaaaaaaay 😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
you're a queen 💓
I make videos sometimes and sometimes I don't. XD  Stay silly and wonderful Gracie. :D
what's the last video??:DD
Happy belated birthday! By the way, Forrest Lawnzzz (#30) is excellent :).
Hey Grace, I don't know.
I read this as 32 things I LAYERED this year.... I would be totally okay with this video too hahaha
Happy birthday!! I hope that I look as good as you when I'm 32... Except that I'm 39... and a boy... Damn you're hot!!!
4:25 Why was blonde Michelle Wie in this video? Makes no sense.
32 things you've learnt this year = 32 reasons why I love this channel 🔥❤
Thank you once again !! I really wish more people could laugh at themselves more. It just makes sense to want to laugh!!
Everything I learnt this year came from this video.
Grace, can i have your top...it speaks to me!
You are one of my favorite humans
GRACIEEE you old fuck I love you
Haven't heard from Margaret Cho or Clidoris Trembles in sooo long!
I hope she'll make couple of videos with her mother and brother during the Christmas season :)
Great video! Happy Birthday Grace, you make my day better whenever I watch you. Thank you for that.\nAlso, the final expression in the video is precious.
Happy birthday! And also you should totally be a drag queen.
I think I want that sweater. Where'd you get it Grace?
whats the video at 3.38 ?
Happy bday why am I her
You share a birthday with my cat!!
I always forget we almost share a birthday (mines the 28th). Hello from the land of 38 year olds, where we miss being 32 and thinking that 32 was old. :)\nHappy birthday Grace!
Happy happy happy birthday! I love you Grace!

Happy Birthday! =)
1:30 FUCK
32? Fuck, I wish she was still in her 20's so she'd still be young and fuckable. Middle aged women aren't attractive.
Shouldve kepts #3 to yourself. It's disgusting to have a stank pussy and then you admit to have stink pussy. At 32 your pussy still stinks???? Thats DISGUSTING
Damm shes so hot........i mean that graphic card.
It's funny cause I literally just finished this exact same build yesterday, except my build had an i7 7700k and not a Ryzen
get the BenQ PD3200U. Ive got the older version, the best monitor for editing photos and probably videos too.
Boyfriend?! Boyfriend?! Boyfriend?!, C'moon spit it.. boyfriend?!
The hardest part of building a PC is choosing the components
Noctua, I love your stuff, but god DAMN your fans are hideous!
6:45 take a shot every time she says right
The cryorig h7 air cooler would of gone nice with the builds colour scheme and provides enough cooling
Austin!! Should of gone with Cryorig H7 Quad Lumi CPU cooler. More aesthetically pleasing and pretty sure it is AMD compatible :D Also handles over-clocking well
D15, man, shoulda just went with an X52, it would have looked much nicer if this was her budget.
So $2700 and you couldnt spend a bit more for the S340 Elite?!
A ship has sailed and you two are on it
Mouse: MX Master 2s\nHeadphones (if you need): Audio Technica M50x
Welcome to the PC Master Race!!
Well, just stumbled across this video, since no one really has mentioned too much on monitors, I am a fan of the 4k dell ips displays.
Mouse: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01APA8D2G/?tag=pcpapi-20 Keyboard:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0164SF9TS/?tag=pcpapi-20Monitor: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017EVR2VM/?tag=pcpapi-20\nMouse should be good for editing. Keyboard is a Cherry MX Silent so (if) you ever game it shouldn’t be noticeable in the audio. The monitor is a 165Hz refresh rate and 16:9 1440p IPS. So you should be good for these.
I can see the awkwardness in your eyes.
You should probably get an LG Ultrawide since most of those flagships are made for productivity and video editing, for keyboard and mice, get any mechanical keyboard of your choosing, like corsair or razer ect.
Video of this build in action please
You so pretty chic Beautiful women ever build pc in youtube😮 😵😍
Get a 144hz monitor you might not game but it will be the difference of night and day
I have a i7 chip,Radeon card, NZXT case the kraken , and the same power supply $2000 and a sold 60 FPS
Doesn't look like she gives a shit. She's like lets just get it built so I can leave.
That mobo is a piece of shite. No joke.
Logitech MX Master 2 and Craft :)\nScreen 27“ 4K or 34“ ultrawide with 1440p.
Monitor Question: Stick with IPS panel for the accurate color. Also don't go any smaller than 27 and if you can find a 100Hz monitor that would be key. Or an IPS Ultra Wide IPS panel with a 3840X1440. Personally I trust Dell monitors and so far I've had good luck with them. my oldest Dell 1080P was bought back in 2006 and it's still working today and I like their contrast ratio and brightness. Just set them both to 100 and good to go. Blacks are black and whites are bright. Also if you don't want a Dell Monitor you can always look into a Samsung or LG or even ASUS. They all make Ultra Wide and once you go there you will never want to go back to 16:9 ratio again.
u should get the mx master mouse
Hi Sara! My advice would be getting a Logitech or Razer gaming mouse. Or if you want a good wireless mouse for premiere or final cut try getting a Logitech Master or 2s. Thanks for reading this! byeeee
TEAR THE PLASTIC SHEET OF THE SIDE PANEL
she has no idea what your on about😂
Never seen her before but I like her :)\nGreat vid
So funny hearing you describe why you switched from EE major to CS because that’s exactly the same reason why I’m studying CS now! Great video BTW
Get a Logitech mx master ii for the mouse, great for editing. And for keyboards, just get something low profile that looks good. A k900 would be a good choice probably. I recommend these parts assuming you're not going to game, although this pc could seriously game.
Nice video! but for me there is little problem and that is volume or position of mic. cause Austin is pretty normal but you Sara you are pretty down on volume
Nice collab, in terms of a mouse, you can try the razer naga epic chroma, it is a bit of an expensive one, but a Nice one, if you have a mouse from razer you might want to check their mousemats aswell, to get the best our of your mouse... You might aswell want to consider a headset or keyboard from them... it is worth the money tho
She´s in it for the money, for sure. Gold digging hard. I hope that Evans is red pilled and goes MGTOW.
Get a Logitech mx master for a mouse and grab the new Logitech wireless keyboard
Sorry to say this i think Austin really fell for her :p
Remove that plastic on the case
MX Master mouse is amazing for editing and productivity.
First off, nice collab Sara. The first video I saw of your was how to Casey Vlog and that was great!\n\nFew things I wanted to throw your way about the build. \n\n1. Get an AIO(All in one) liquid cooler for you PC to replace the big heat sync with the brown fans. You have a nice looking case and that cooler for the cpu just ruins the build aesthetic. \n2. Check out cable mod to see if you can get some white and purple cables for your build instead of the plain black ones. Again, aesthetics. :D \n3. Check out the MX Master mouse. The new white one would look sick with your white and Purple PC! \n\nTotally just suggestions! You just got a new subscriber, great video.
12:36 to 12:38 duh??
RYZEN Overclocking tutorial please...\nhmm...you should go for razer deathadder.. or Rival 310 or Logitech MX Master mouse with LG 34UC89G-B. 34inch Ultrawide with 144 hz refreshrate and G-sync
SteelSeries Apex M500 keyboard, SteelSeries Rival 310 Mouse, SteelSeries QCK Mouse Pad, Sennheiser HD 6 Mix Headphones
Get a k95 platinum
Why not Linux?
Get K95 platinum keyboard
Fake Technician?
Coffee lake Austin!
Monitor: 1440p IPS, just something decent, mouse: Logitech Mx master 2, keyboard, something with cherry MX brown switches.
Austin stop kidnapping women
Get the LG 29 21:9 Monitor
Slap in some intake fans for some better airflow.
Congrats!
Hackintosh???
11:11 okay, where's the power button\n😂😂
man i wish i had that kinda cash, sigh, great video subbed ! tell us your editing  experience
@austeneveans dude stop being such a nerd she is perfect!
My gaming sutup is just a 120 dollar dell optiplex and a gtx 1050 ti inside. It costs if i was going cheaper i would get a 47 dollar dell optiplex and a gtx 1030
i did not think it would be that big in real life -Austin Evans 2017 ;)
Well, for keyboard...you should check out the world of custom mechanical keyboards, and build your own keyboard with a cool set of keycaps.  ;)
Did nobody notice that the protective plastic is still on the window of the case??
you have psycho girl eyes
is this gonna be on Austin's channel?
Should of got 2x ssds and put them in raid 0 much cheaper than m.2 and same speed.
Hi, if you're looking for a 4k monitor you can check out the LG 27UD58-B https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IRQAYPE/_encoding=UTF8?coliid=IZ5YZEH8H38I&colid=14HU615YIHTNJ
Do you think he hit that after the video?
Predator X34 Monitor maybe by Asus or Dell P2415Q Monitor, and Accessories from Logitech with no doubt. peace x
Intel squad shout out to AMD for shit processors
The best mouse is logitech g250
who's the next hot girl that austin builds a pc with next?
I think the logitic mx master 2s wireless mouse would be perfect for you!\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Cross-Computer-Control-910-005138/dp/B071Z8RZHG
Did you know that you can install mac os on that pc?
You can view Linus Tech Tips WAN show and Paul's hardware and bitwits tech talks.\n\nThey provide up to date news on pretty much everything tech. Those will show you relevant and interesting new pieces of tech that aren't apple related
Austin: the cpu cooler is a BIT over kill\nMe: the cpu cooler is 10 times bigger than the cpu what the hell you mean a BIT overkill
picking out custom pc parts are way harder than building a pc.
Buy the mx master 2s as a mouse
Welcome to the MASTER RACE
Yoooooo i thought this was austin's channel. Who the hell are you?
you had me at insanely exciting.
she is fucking every youtube nerd ever.
Is she his brother
I want this shit I’m out
lol Austin your boner reached a high score 3 mm
that cpu cooler is looking ugly should get a aio cooler.
Get a 1080p 144hz monitor(what ever brand you want)  and for mouse a Mionix caster or Logitech MX master and for keyboard get a Corsair one.
Logitech craft for keyboard and logitech mx master 2s for the mouse
Welcome to the PC masterace
if you use shortcut keys on your keyboard when youre editing youll want something like a logitech keyboard like the g710+ or corsair k95 or other types of keyboards with extra reprogrammable keys and profiles if youre not that much into using a lot of shortcuts you can get pretty much a ordinary backlit mechanical keyboard something like the corsair k70, the k70 rapidfire if youre into a bit more competitive gaming when you have free time, k65, or logitech g pro, a reasonably priced priced keyboard with romer g switches (very good ones btw) or razer keyboards and so on multi color 1 color everything is depending on preference, for a mouse if you want it mainly for editing then logitech mx master s2 if not a normal gaming mouse does the job logitech g pro mouse, razer deathadder, corsair glaive, logitech g502, roccat kova, roccat tyon and so on
*builds a $2700 Insane Gaming Pc*\nIt's pretty
http://store.hp.com/us/en/pdp/hp-z27s-27-inch-ips-uhd-display-%28energy-star%29\nThe HP Z27s will serve all your editing needs with a 4k display and great color accuracy. Price is also low enough to consider multiple monitors for increased work space.\n\nIs for mice, i recommend anything by mionix, my personal favorite is the NAOS. Excellent ergonomics, decent sensor and isn't too gamerish. Can be frequently found for under 40$\nAs for keyboards your guess is as good as mine but i personally run a Corsair STRAFE RGB with mx cherry silent switches.
Where the intake fans at? That thing's gonna be a dust magnet :(
its just really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really expensive legos.
Asus PG348Q for your monitor. \n\nMouse Logitech G903\n\nKeyboard Corsair K95 or Das Keyboard 4 Professional
Make sure you calibrate your monitor!
it's not EPYC its Ryzen wink wink :D
K95 keyboard, G602 mouse, and the Asus ROG PG348Q 34-Inch Ultra-wide QHD Swift Curved Gaming Monitor or if on a budget get the ASUS PB287Q 28 4K/ UHD 3840x2160 1ms DisplayPort HDMI Ergonomic Back-lit LED Monitor
Fook ya mate, they definitely smashed
Keyboard: Corsair K95\n(its amazing)
Get the logitech mx master!
I'm guessing the question soon will be 'Tara where are you?'
tarararewee?
Tarawewawi
Tara is taking him to all these places without telling him where because she is probably going to kill him at one of them.
I trolled my girlfriend, for vanity and youtube likes.
Wow so original...
Yeah... that was painfully not funny.
unoriginal wanker
Lots of negative comments but the content was still good :)
Would have been a good video if the last one was a Tara would you marry me?, but this is just annoying.
not funny, not original.  go away
Wow your girlfriend is so lucky.  She must think you're so unique.  I've never seen anyone do a video like this before..............................
unfunny copy of the other guy wasn't funny either
Myanmar is the answer.
tarawawy?
I challenge you to a duel in quake live
I guess she doesn't understand that not responding will cancel out the joke?
But, where were they?
If she havent dumped you after this, your lucky..........
Breaking News: Man annoys girlfriend with same repetitive unfunny prank over and over again, films it and the video goes ｖｉｒａｌ
Where were you at :25? Jay and Silent Bob get around
Don't see how this is remotely funny, just a pretty sad attempt to seem witty.
Cringey and not funny at all
What's her name?
Tara take me along next time.  Especially to the place with the electric scooter.
At one point they were in Crysis
lol the amount of people in the comments that can't even handle this video.
guess who is single again!
Tararre, say something.
Bali island?
Bali ?
tarawerarwe?
tarawarewee??
those looks!! killing me
tara we a wi?
Tara we're early.
Tarawarwee
Tarawerawi
Tarawaree
tarawaweeee
TARY ARY
1:13 :D
tarararee
!SNOOCHY BOOCHIES!
Tarawherarwe?
Fake
tarawarawe
Thararawrai
Tararare
Tarawherearewe
tara's a hottie
poor Tara
Taraawaweee
i'd take this down before your gf reads the comments and gets validation for how annoyingly unfunny this is
Fuck bro you're annoying, you're lucky she didn't ditch you.
Tara, please answer him!
tawaawaawy?
what's with the random Jay and Silent Bob painting at 0:25 ? Where was that?
Tara, you should be with me instead.  I will never ask you where we are.
Is it only for me or she played along the whole video?..
when they are in the bedroom 'Tara, where are we?'
Where are we Tara?
WHERE ARE YOU THEN?!
Ruined your whole trip for this lol
Yep. These things still aren't cute or funny or anything
This is the least enjoyable version of this, bothering your girlfriend thing. You should take a page from the “they got enough X here” or the ikea pun guy.
how is this funny?
leaves on the motor bike - laughed real hard
Hi @LTavvy! I'm with ABC News! Did you make this video? Can we use it on all ABC platforms/partners with credit to you?
Tawawawee
tarawaahwahhee
Bunch of white supremacist
Tara where are weed?
Snootch to the nootch
where are we tho? #woke
Why?
Nobody cares
Abusing women, filming it and putting it on YouTube for the world to see is NOT okay.  Males need to realize that this is NOT acceptable behavior.
Millonarios 💙⚽
*U2 - You’re The Best Thing About Me*

Hi all, \n\nI am Jorge from Lima, Peru. \n\nMy brother and I recorded this new single called Nightmares and Dreams: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlR_Om_nqeo. \n\nWe appreciate your comments in advance and we hope you enjoy this new hit. \n\nThank You. \nPeace and Love
War,rattle&hum,jaushatree after that thay turned in to a computerized pop band miss the old u2
Get the fuck out of New York while you still can!!! If you didn't get the message you are blind!
Opps got a bit political in the end!
Thank God, they're back, you know it's a good U2 song when you get goose bumps and tears in your eyes.
1:53 best part of the video. Millonarios Shield!   )oo/M(   💙🇨🇴
The best song. I am be fond of U2. This song reminde lot of others. It is my opinion.
the BEST EVER, i'v been to all concerts in Vancouver, B.C.
When does Van Damme become a drummer???
I love Your smile in this video. I LOVE THIS SONG!I LOVE U2! I'm fan for 20 years and this song is great. Come to Poland, please! I miss You!
Bono sounds more like a girl with every new song. Weird.
Excellent shots of the Big Apple, Lady Liberty, and the Freedom Tower!!!!
Adam Clayton walking in NYC looks like Anthony Bourdain on one of his food travel shows in this video. : )
I love these guys...!!!\n💕 God bless U2 💕
They're still ALIVE!!! Even Bono is there! I really thought him dead! But where's the hat?
The Edge, what a voice!!
Could anybody transcript the speech in the end of the video... My English is not strong enough... I can only hear the separate words... (
Bono Has bad hair transplant. looks likechucky hair .\n\n\nby the way good song
❤❤❤❤
😙😙😙😗😙
I didn't really like this song until now I understand it... Can't wait any longer for a new album!!!
Only true fans will enjoy this, i'm included. Love this song.
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
Adam Clayton ❤🙌🙌 The BEST
Why USA flag? You are Irish

THANK YOU FOR SAVING 2017
Amazing :-)
Who knows where the bar and the Harley Quinn looking bartender is? That looks like my kind of joint!
Yes, I am a fallen angel.. This is my highway to hell death sentence prison i fell into.. I deserve the lake of fire.. I am a prodigal son.. i preexisted my upside down flesh snake skin birth.. my free will was in heaven my home i fell from.. I followed Lucifer here for prostitution and riotous living..By Grace through faith in Jesus Christ I am converted turned upside down again reconciled pardoned adopted and going back home to heaven.. I await the redemption of my body ... relationship not religion .. Lucifer runs all governments and religions.. NYC is about to die
Give me whatever vitamins Larry Mullen Jr is taking.
U2 are one of the best rock band ever, but I think this song is not that good.
How is U2 a thing
Shocking song! Didn't buy the last album doubt Il buy this one!
Have they forgotten they're Irish?
Looks like predictive programming about the NEO 9-11 in Babylon the Great > the complete destruction of NYC under an upcoming full moon...  U2 saying goodbye and walking away b4 the illuminated event?  In your face!
U2 makes music for McDonald's commercials now?
I really don't like this video. I get it, on the face of it. But I don't like it. And for all the charms, in particular from Bono...I don't get the charms.\nThe song I'm not sure about. Songs Of Innocence is great cuz it couldn't not be, but it's also near the bottom of the canon. I hope this album doesn't follow that direction, because waiting years for a U2 album means I should get something in the top 5.
Me encanta!!!😍
I feel it lacks the energy of erstwhile U2, but I guess they're getting old... They should've made a more aggressive bass rhythm, Adam was severely under represented in the track...
bunk
What an annoyingly unwatchable video!!!
Great song, terrible video
Zzzzzzzzzz. Boring. Stale. Ha ha ha ha.
I'm digging the song. But honestly,  that video sucked.
Holy SHIT this sucks
I love this song but why does Larry look so miserable all the time? :-(
This sounds very safe,almost lazy b-side standard .Have U2 lost their sparkle?
I'll pay for that wall and build it with my own hands! Tony Ferguson
byeee Felicia hahah gotta love fergy lol
I love Werdum so much for this hahaha
I can't wait to see his fight I like Lee to. But I am not sure he is ready for Ferguson!
Just one wicked Werdum knee on T-Ferg’s chin and he’s done like Lombard, when Hendo put his lights out...
Ferguson wouldn't do that to just anybody, it's because of Werdum's manager who is also Khabib's manager. What Ferguson did wrong is involving Werdum but it's understandable. If I had a problem with your friend and I saw you with him of course I could have issues with you too. Khabib and his manager have messed around with Ferguson's career by wasting his time and costing him his biggest payday, of course he hates anybody attached to him. He isn't doing this just to be an ass hole without reason.
So now you want to bring up weight difference when Werdum stands up?  Now it's an issue when you get put in your place.  I guess Tony  had some second thoughts  then he vents  his emotions to people around him like Paulie after Conor
Wearing glasses and a hood  on the hat !! Very nervous , uncomfortable and scared . Duhhh
Tony hijo de tu puta madre ferguzon
https://youtu.be/eHmbO6s1DmU
Damn tony keeping his composure . That's dope
Go agent smith
Cabron hahahhaha i like his Spanish
Fabricio is a slimeball .
Smelly Brazilian like his country..
tony carayusen
Werdum's jealous of Ferguson's gourmet green juice.
subtitles would be good
Fabricio 110 kg Tony 70 kg.
Werdum said conor would tee off on you
Tony made werdum take a few steps back when he stood up
What i'm trying to say is... What I'll like to say is... hahaha
I'll ankle pick you...that was funny.
dont mess with brazilians or they will pull out your teeth! 😂👊
Werdum can kill Ferguson in a 10 seconds
Thought Ferguson handled himself well.
Cara como eu ri do Werdum,isso é homem de verdade lutador por isso  que gosto dele kkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Tony trying to act like he was gonna do something !!!! Werdum would of dismantle him!!!!
Hey have fun fighting on my under card LOL end of battle.
Since he appeared in TUF he showed he was a piece of crap
Werdum was about to KO his ass... lol
Ferguson has been a tool since he came on the scene on TUF. Dudes a kook
Fabricio bad energy werdum
Werdum would kill tony...
Ferguson=Honeybadger\n\nWerdum=Tiger
That douche
Weight classes, judges, ppv ruin the UFC
É isso aí werdum. Acabá com esse cu de cachorro kkkkkkk
Tony Black Energy Ferguson
Whoa tony, easy man, thats werdum, the guy that subbed fedor and tuned up and subbed cain.
Kayate tu puta madre and he even didnt stand up wtf
Wolf tix
El cucuy 😍😜👹
Kkkkk
CÚ DE CACHORRO KKKKKKKKKKKKKK
tony dark matter ferguson
Sou fã do werdum mano! Kkkkkk ele é sinistro!
Tony is a G.Real
Ferguson pau no cu do carajo!!!
Animo cukuy Ferguson
Tony Ferguson💪💪 goat
So what got in Werdums panties? Dude was more trigger then anything ive seen in awhile.
Tony is so Bs, he not even could make a point on the interview   After almost got crushed by Verdun, super funny 🤣🤣
he's channeling conor..lol.....why not.
LOL  I doe say nutin cause I'm heavy weight oh no
I don't like fake people coming from ferguson is the biggest irony ever
have fun fighting on my undercard.    -Ferguson.
I think verdum has a ADHD problem, this guy is not matured
Ferguson doesn't think he's fake? He has one of the most affected, uncomfortable, personalities in the UFC. Everything about him is fake
Tony doesn't know how to speak Spanish
Tony looked like  a hobbit next to verdum. I like Ferguson and hope he wrecks Kevin Lee.
werdum would kill him in 10 seconds
Werdum picks on smaller guys to make himself feel better for that 1st round KO loss to p4p king #stiopic #immigrantmentality
Hahaha Ferguson is out of his mind. He looks stressed out for some reason, werdum can probably brake his arms and put him in coma in seconds.
Now I want to watch Kevin Lee and Derrick Lewis to win their fights for sure.
why did tony say that thing about kicking werdums ass there mustve been some background story here
Werdum would of killed his ass
I would have to go with werdum whooping his ass
Someone tell me what werdum was saying  please
I EMBRACE THE CRINGE GOD TONY
UFC fans should go back too WWE.\nWAAAAAAH WAWAWA WAAAAH beta
wtf is tony talking about.. he doesnt like people who dont run as hard as him and those who didnt give him ice for an ice bath?
Its impossible not to like Werdum
Stfu werdum.. Or Stipe will come there and crash u like a blob
Damn! Tony's Spanish is awful!!! Werdum is such a tool! I hope Lewis KO  him the fudge out!!!
Lol i think the mistake is in the interviewer\nWhy they interview both guy in the same place with different question and camera lol
lol ankle pick werdum? werdum would crush your throat in a heartbeat
maybe cos Tony cutting 30lbs while Werdum can eat popeyes with DC cos he got 265lbs allowance
Why is Tony Ferguson is built like Crash Bandicoot? lol
1:18 Ferguson to Werdum: Shut up before I ankle pick you!!\n\nYea good luck with that homie. \nLmfao
Werdum is right...Tony is different in front of camera...
If you look close...Tony Ferguson has bigger hands than Werdum WTF???
why does verdum say i dont like bisping all the time
hold on I'm talking brother -- what a preppy, street thing to say. Some elements of hood in here.
Tony vs Werdum could have happened in the old UFC days.
I didn't know Kev is Mexican?!
If Werdum can beat Cain, he can easily swat Tony around.
Tony really trying to be Conor 😂
Verdum is a coward picking I fight with a smaller fighter
Hahah Werdum picking a fight in 3 languages
Fergie ferg trying to hype himself like mcgregor does. Cringy.
aiai.. sou brasileiro...\n\ne achei a atitude do Werdum uma grande babaquice, tão ruim quanto à do outro idiota chamado Ferguson.\n\nComo dizia o poeta: o inferno e o cemitério estão cheios de valentões...'
Ferguson se acha a estrela... só que não ...
So Ferguson says he'd kick Werdums ass if he had to. Werdum gets offended and mouths off. Then Ferguson plays the victim by saying Werdums trying to fight a small 155 pounder? I'm giving this one to Werdum.
Tony Fergunson is a great fighter.\nBut he acted like a douchebag on this one. He was the one who idiotically provoked this beef.
We're gonna just pretend like Werdum didn't just try to cut him off mid sentence?
Tony u not even close to what verdum has achieved..SFU
That idiot should learn how to speak English  stupid no respect   have some class and be civilised  you stupid puta   English English English if you can't speak English don't speak rubbish lol lol lol looser
Werdum switched to Spanish to Portuguese real quick! Guy is truly gifted with speaking all these different languages at one time lol
Lets's translate this
Made a fortune appealing to the natural instincts of humans. Right on man
You Go Hugh. Singular man accomplishing great business.
This was created before he died
talk about revenge on the first chick who cheated
....it's hot down here.
I believe in exactly what Hughe Hefner believes in; something good, magical, and exciting, yet unconscious.
So basically he got red pilled after rejection and cucked. And the rest is history
Dad : What do you wanna grow up to be ?\nMe: Hugh Hefner.
RIP to the man
Say Hi to John Holmes, let him know Ron Jeremy is taking care of unfinished business down here where he left off.  Rip playboy
HUGH HEFFNER HELD CIA  ,DEMON ,WORSHIPPERS AND A SATANIC PROMIS , AND SACRIFICE , OMG SACRIFICE TO THE DEVIL
He live the life only most men only dream about, and he heard he being buried next to Marilyn M.
Not many men were  so lucky to be surrounded  by so many beautiful  women . Hugh Hefner is one of them. RIP Hefner.
Got married, had a daughter, had a midlife crisis, then decided his life was missing something. He started a magazine that glorifies the objectification of women. Then got divorced, got rich, and died. Was it worth it?
Although I don’t approve of pornography and I am not a fan of Mr. Hefner, I’m sorry that he died.
Hugh Hefner was murdered/silenced so that he couldn't name Hollywood peadophiles in a plea deal.
I never got to meet him:(
RIP Heff. Like once he said Life is too short to be living somebody else's dream.
What a great man! So sad seeing him go😒😰
Hugh had a very sweet mother! Investing in her sons business!
At least he  does not need Viagra to get stiff anymore.
very wicked evil man, he caused so many people to fall into sin because of his iconic sinful influence, the devil was and still is his father even in death. hes now reaping what he sowed now, hugh hefner is merely a proverb for mankind to learn of what NOT to do. its a shame that he chose to throw away his soul and how he lived to continue to not genuinely care for other peoples hearts and souls, not even his own son, he was a bad role model for so many things, he threw away his role as a father, husband and man in general, please learn from this mans selfish way of life, run to Jesus.
It took me a long time to like hugh hefner.
Well, at least he wasn't a hypocrite. There's more mercy from God for straightforward bad people than for liars and hypocrites. Nevertheless, let's hope he repented at the last, because otherwise there'll be no RIP for poor, pathetic Heff.
There goes the last sane man on earth.
HEFFF IM MISS YOU GAVE MY LITTLE BROTHER FIRST PLAYBOY.
He sold his soul to the devil.   What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul.
His. Last. \nWord\nWas\nIts\nGetting. Hot.\nIn. Here😈😈😈😈😈
Their is a video of Hugh Hefner, rejecting the call to accept JESUS CHRIST, by Victor The Baptist; on youtube, What does it profit a man to gain the 🌎 world to lose his soul, Mark 8:36!!!!

CERTIFIED AMERICAN BADASS #5\n               HUGH HEFNER\nStop-Motion Animation Comedy dedicated to The Gentleman About Town - Hugh Hefner
DIRTY PEDOPHILE!!!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS CASE , RAPING 5YEARS OLD???????????????
So all of those scantily clad Playboy bunnies need a place to live now? And all that I need is a mansion??? And then they can all come and live with me and I'll be in heaven??? Thank you JESUS!
Hugh hefner died still an IMPERFECT MAN, seen as a pervert and just fully degraded woman..
Does anyone no about the hidden bunny on the cover you have to look hard to find it but I want to no is why and when it started my wife was reading a article in one of mine when she ask did you no about the Playboy Bunny hidden on the cover I said no she showed it it has a hint were to find it we stared looking every month one was hard a girl had blond hair they made the bunny with it this was around the same time China was on the cover can't recall if she was playmate I didn't get it for some time after but we went in the store every month to look for the bunny we were friends with the store owner they ask what we were doing we told they said it was ok just not to open or rip the plastic if it's a secret cool if not I'd like to no I'll keep looking
This man is a great example of gain the whole world but lose your soul..
Man if only he knew that throught the world for more than 5 decades he was responsiable for the hapiness of a lot of  young men ... I myself was one who used to spend a lot of time in the rest room just reding playboy.
14:20 the ultimate Alpha males.
A lot of the girls I've fallen in love with. What's love got to do with it? Orwellian dementia.
My daughter in law loved Hugh Hefner. He was a great business man. He showed people you can do anything no matter where they come from. He lived a great  lifetime
Good riddance to bad rubbish.
He destroyed to many families
He did all this to get back at his wife nice
The real moral of the story:\nFirst and foremost, a number of girlfriends are easier than one wife.
oddly i expect his empire is bancrupt ... but his reputation allowed him to survive in the last years ~
He Used women and in the end women used him....Karma.
Thanks for the good childhood memories❤️
Clint eastwood is going to be the next to go
No such things as the last words of Hefner! Ain’t a titty that will come out a bra that you can’t thank hugh.....
Hugh created a media empire that revolved around the objectification of women, and made it seem intellectual and hip to do so. We should not idolize him.

Perverted Pedophile! ....Gone! ...
WORLDAASS NEWS. MY REGRETS HUGH
HIs life was all a lie. He may have had fame and money, but it was all a superficial.
Hef was indeed on his own right a trailblazer breaking the taboos and moraes of American Society.He really set the standard and brought a relax element to Americans men and women alike there is only one Hef.
I can't help but wonder where you spend your eternity and did anyone tell you the sinners prayer in your old age or did they just like you for your money
Life is just vanity and chasing after wind. But to lie that he was not into it for the money is untrue. May his soul RIP.
This guy is my God \nr.i.p Hef
What a life! He boinked the hottest women on the world all his life and became rich doing so. He continued this until he was 91! Awesome! RIP.
Watch America suddenly go into a new age of purity
The good ones always die too young.
How many young men would look at his magazine and have unrealistic expectations for a woman especially after child birth. The world is a better place with him dead
Women are NOT sexual objects they are Human beings with feelings, talents and deserve to be treated with respect and not used for the pleasure of the Male Supreme.  They are the bearers of life, and the authors of Love and have a natural spirituality.  Women are to be loved and repected as the Nurtures of society, not used for the Male Supremacy that this world promotes.
Well if he did make it to heaven.....then all the rest of us are safe when our time comes!
He was a sexual predator,  used his money to control silly young women
There is No Rest or peace for the unrepentant sinner. Only a fearful Judgment. God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that everyone believing in Him should not PERISH but have Everlasting life.
Sexist pig! Ugh...
Sadly, he is not in heaven with God.
Life is like you dip the tip of your finger in a cup of water and take it out,  all the money, all the girls, all his property, left behind, now he's in darkness alone he took nothing with him, except his deeds. Life is short, lets work for the after life instead.
NOW!!!   How it all gets divvyed up!  Who gets what?  Lets play the Family Feud!
He died with a stiffy
Can anyone from these sick twisted comments politely explain to me how is this man an example or anyone's missed one? what is his legacy he left to YOU? HOW IN ANY WAY HE HAS SHOWED ANY GOOD THING TO THIS WORLD ?
I guess the bunnies aren't going to be playing Hop on Pop anymore.
Hugh's last words: Jesus, I want to ask for your......  uhhhhhhhh.  \nDon't worry, I hear it's a dry heat down there.  lol
He saw the goodness in others...helped so many people and animals...He was there with Tea, Sympathy, and Hospitality when one needed a Friend...!!
no matter how many women and how much money he had, he finally died.
Im sure that the devil has a special cell for this animal.....
Some militant feminists and the highly religious may think that Hef doesn't deserve to go to Heaven, But I say he's already been living in Heaven for the last 60 odd years (am I right guys ? nudge nudge wink wink). Still one does have to wonder, is it possible that Heaven may actually be a bit of a let down for Hef, given the life he's been living? LOL & RIP.
This is amazing advice but it's very situational. Don't do this with a narcissist, or anyone who is emotionally immature. In both childhood and adulthood I've expressed when I'm hurt to my parents, and their immediate reaction was denial, rejection and gas-lighting. Rarely will they apologize and soften up. My mother, who adores being the victim in any circumstance, can never bring herself to a proper apology, it is always I'm sorry you misinterpreted what I said to anyone and everyone.... If you practice this with these type of people, it can draw up a lot of resentment and make it harder to open up (or be open) to someone who is genuinely emotionally there for you. So yes, good advice, but be careful. The supportive and emotionally vulnerable girlfriend is not always the reaction. Sometimes she'll lash out and say you're making her out to be the villain.
My only qualm:\n\nI know it's stupid, but...\n\nNo. It's not stupid to feel unimportant when you're trying to have a conversation about something that matters to you with someone that matters to you. It's not stupid to feel hurt or to ask to have just a moment of their undivided attention😕
*I want to address the line: I have a big ego by asking you for your attention, forgive me.* Asking someone for their attention doesn't mean you have a big ego, it simply means you want to connect. If said person has abruptly stopped conversing with to play Candy Crush or Facebook, that is fine, you can leave them be and have the conversation another time or you can ask them for their attention. _I feel that should be said. if you think I am wrong then by all means, critique me.
The actors were amazing at fake fighting!
well done!  hard to be vulnerable.
This video might have saved something in my life... we'll see
Okay now I need to be in relationship to try this
Disclaimer:: assumption made--- the other one is sane..lol
Fucking stupid. Yeah, just be stronger, it will help. Wasting my time.
The very part where he said I am a fragile being. he as an actor couldn't take it sereously, because he forced himself not to grin on it... He knows how exaggerated that script is. xD And she smiled on that too. She is so happy to know that he is fragile.\nEitherway - being realy honest with each other and towards others nowdays is very difficult, because people judge and some partners do that too and they keep on hurting their spouse instead of listening that much. It depends on the individual...
We can't control someone elses reactions. Sometimes even explaining calmly doesn't get us the support we need, it doesnt always work that way and to be honest he sounded very apologetic. Sometimes people will explode or find things offensive no matter how calmly we state our point.
Well the girl chatacter is kind of a bitch in this one
I love this channel. One of the most insightful places on YouTube in my opinion.
I dunno about this one.  Sure, communicate better and you can avoid patterns of these types of interactions before the relationship deteriorates in the first place.  But, that first segment looks more like negative sentiment override where neutral behavior is interpreted as criticism and each party is basically waiting to attack or be defensive.  Showing vulnerability at that point may not do much to improve interactions between people who no longer feel fondly for each other.
This is so real. I thought it was just me who wanted to hurt the ones I love when feeling mysterious hurt. Thank you for this amazing video!
When I first watched this video, I thought I realized where I went wrong with a friend/love interest that I lost very recently.\nThen I read the comments and a lot of people had similar experiences as myself.\nI've finally realized I've done this with my friend. I did this with my friend. I showed vulnerability. I showed hurt. I was calm. I told her I wanted to talk about it. I showed compassion for how she was feeling. I didn't attack or berate her. I told her I understood her and didn't mean any harm to her or mean anything ruthless to her.\nWhen I first told this girl I had feelings for her, she was drunk. I didn't know that. When she told me she was drunk, I said, Oh, I should've known. And that ticked her off, but she does drink fairly often, so it was a fair statement.\nAnd to cut the story short, every time I'd try to talk about what happened that night, she'd get defensive and tell me to stop and move forward and leave it alone. That's not healthy. I was showing hurt, vulnerability, and love, but she pushed it all away and wouldn't accept it. Yes, show all those things, but it doesn't guarantee you'll be reciprocated. I wasn't reciprocated.\nSometimes when I felt she was ignoring me during normal conversation my hurt would come up and I'd attack her. I'd argue with her. This continued for a month until she finally called it quits and blocked and banned me from her entire life...\nEven during the time I told her my feelings she said, We all fear rejection but you just gotta keep putting yourself out there. I told her I knew my fears were correct and that she didn't share the same feelings as me. She told me not to analyze her and that what I was analyzing wasn't what she meant. She was drunk, mind you, so who knows what the Hell was going through her mind. And during the same time I'd sometimes bring up moving on and letting go. How did she react? What the fuck?! And then eventually she was like, I do have feelings for you, if you're still asking. That gave me hope, but things still didn't seem right.\nThe next morning we talked about some of it, but she wanted to avoid it entirely and even said it was a disaster. She even blamed me for trying to have a conversation with her while she was intoxicated, when I was unaware until she told me. And if I had just assumed she was drunk, she would've gotten mad at me then too because she hates when I assume things. So either way, I would've been wrong and blamed for it. \nI tried talking to her calmly. I tried to have a mature conversation with her. My guard was already completely down and I was ready to just communicate. She refused. She obviously regretted what she said while drunk. Even though your true inhibitions, your true feelings, the truth comes out when you're drunk, she even denied that notion when I brought it up, but I may have brought it up in a passive aggressive way too. But seriously, I was already vulnerable and she wasn't accepting it or opening up to me, so I had a right to start getting mad. I opened up with vulnerability and showed my goddamn hurt. Because liking her actually hurt me because I was so worried I'd get rejected and I hadn't liked a girl like this for at least 2 years, so I was scared. I made myself depressed over it. I tried keeping it bottled up, but I ended up just letting it out and apparently at the most misopportune time. I let my crush on her literally crush me until I was forced to just let it out. I was most vulnerable at that point because I was already hurting from thinking about rejection. But I still went in vulnerable. And I did try to handle it the best I could by telling her I'd move on and let go. She got mad when I SAID I would move on and let go, but guess what SHE told me to do the next morning? Move on, Jake. Let go, Jake. When I said it, she had a problem with it. When she said it, she meant it as a demand.\nAnd then when I just couldn't get any further with her with communication on the situation, I just gave up when she told me, Regardless of what I said. Enough I quit replying after that. I left the conversation. 10 minutes later she texts me, Read and ignored sweet She got mad at me for leaving the conversation where it was. She got mad at me for letting it go. She got mad that I was trying to move on. I replied back to her, I didn't know what to say. I didn't want to bother you further. Her response, K. I asked if she was mad at me. She yelled at me with a, NO response. What was i supposed to do? I've done the reasoning through my head plenty of times and what I should've done is just kept on ignoring her and not replying. Let it fester in her for a while. Let her think about it. I never gave her time to think about things like that because I always felt bad for ignoring her or leaving a conversation where it was, even randomly. That's just not how I am. But I realize it was her game. I was playing her game and I didn't succeed. What I should've done is walked away and not talk to her for awhile. What I did was feel guilty for leaving her unanswered, even though she told me, Enough. \nAnd then after that little fiasco, this all happened on the day of the eclipse, so she brought up the eclipse as a change of subject. we talked about it very briefly before she just read and ignored my text mid-conversation. I left it alone, but after about 2 hours, I just went off on her and told her how I didn't appreciate how she was treating the situation and me. That's when we got into a heated argument. She even threatened that if I don't stop, then we can't be friends anymore and she even added in, And that would make me really sad. Every other argument we'd have that day she'd bring up the notion of, Friends or nah? She was FORCING a choice onto me. Not to mention before the arguments she yelled at me saying, WE ARE FRIENDS. THAT'S IT. When I was trying to communicate about the night before. She wouldn't have any of it. I wasn't trying to force a relationship. I told her many times I was in no rush to jump in a relationship. I told her many times I respected the way she felt and that if she wasn't ready, I was okay with it. I gave all the assurance in the goddamn world. And she still yelled at me for trying to communicate. She didn't want to be vulnerable with me like I was with her. She kept on forcing the notion of us being friends or not onto me when we were arguing. Do you know how hard that is? You're asking me to ignore my feelings and hurt and how you've yelled at me all day, and you're trying to force me to either be your friend or leave you. That's not freaking healthy!!!!! I finally gave in because she threatened to block me if I didn't give her a break and leave it alone. I tried being her friend, but every time we'd talk I'd want to go back to that day and try to talk about it. She wouldn't have any of it. She wanted it to be left in the past. As if 2 days to a week ago or even a month ago can be considered The past. The immediate past, sure, but you don't just get over something like that immediately. But that's what she expected form me. She expected me to be just her friend and forget everything that happened that night and day. \nIt felt very manipulative and controlling. \nFunny/ironic thing is, I don't think she spoke to me extensively while drunk again after that. She might've had some small talk with me while drunk, but never got into anything too deep again while drunk. Never build friendships with people who will talk to you often while drunk. The first time we bonded over deep shit was when she was drunk. Yeah, never bonding with someone again while they're drunk. And if I do, It'll be left as is, a drunk memory. I'm not taking anything seriously from another bonding moment with a drunk person/friend again. I'll remember it for future reference, but as for taking it seriously and thinking it means anything serious, nah, never again.\nShe knew her problem, but wouldn't admit to it. She quit talking to me while drunk, but she wouldn't apologize to me for it or give any kind of closure over it or any kind of communication over it. I would explain explain and explain what I was thinking and feeling to her, but she'd never do the same for me. She'd even question me at times, I don't understand why you continue to let this eat at you. And I told her it was because I didn't understand it. Communication is all about understanding. Without communication, there is no understanding, and with no understanding makes assumptions and other ideas come up in your mind to try and justify it. And she got mad at those assumptions and ideas when i shared them with her. But she wasn't mature enough to communicate with me, so why is she blaming me when she could've communicated and helped me better understand things? \nShe tried to make me feel guilty for my feelings. I've went over it several times in my head since she's been gone and I'm realizing more and more how manipulative and controlling she was. She didn't want me to think a certain way. She didn't want me to think of her in a negative light. She didn't want me to leave her, but she wanted me to move on and let go. When I put the idea in her that I might not want to be friends anymore, she got scared. She gave me puppy dog eyes and made me feel bad for even that. I felt guilty. She guilt tripped me. She guilt me into being her friend. She guilt tripped me in being her friend when I tried to move on and let go. She guilt tripped me when i thought about ending the friendship. She guilt tripped me for my feelings. All so she could slice my throat open herself and end it herself. She wanted the satisfaction of watching me bleed. She took advantage of my vulnerability and weakness. You open yourself up to people and you're only opening up a bigger wound for them to stab you in and make it sting a Hell of a lot more.
What's crazy is how ppl wouldn't really respond that way. Most ppl would continue on the phone and say just a sec and be mad and call you needy bcuz u need that time now not to wait on then. At least that's been my experience. No matter how I ask for time, attention, and affection. I'm always told I'm selfish and immature.
I don't want to see a fight between a couple ! I am here for advice !!
Mr Botton .. Seen that critique of your channel and methodology ? Going to respond ? .. personally .. i like your channel .. it has been a comforting voice through some very, very tough times, made me feel like everything was ok, like i could deal with another day on this planet, in this spatial / historical manifestation of some kind of conciousness .. the only doubt raised that temporarily  impacted was the commodification, selling of tat at exhorbitant prices but in retrospect, heck we all gotta make a buck to survive, nobodys twisting their bourgeoise arms .. as for me .. how'm i gonna put a few lines on the table and keep my feet in tepid milk stout as i tempt my word processor toward a determinal syntax error ? ;] A4
It feels like you're just rehashing old videos under vaguely different titles... time for something new to get this channel back up and running again
I just watched it with my Girlfriend to see if there is something new that we could apply in our relationship. We were so happy to realize that we already act like this. Unfortunately we realized that a lot of people we know do not.
kinda clicked bc jack is in the thumbnail soo
I've always wonder at The School Of Life is this advice to help everyone no matter where we are in life. Wether you are a 14 year old in the states or a 23 year old attending college are you all makerting to every person?
I see myself in this.
which one of yall read the monologue in the narrator’s voice
is it ok if i show that i'm hurt, angrily?
hey how does the rest of the calmer discussion end???
Unless you're dating a sociopath as they will use any vulnerability you show against you.
I like how they learn to communicate better on this one thing, then argue about something else afterwards. It seems realistic to point out that this will not end all conflict.
of course he’s right, it’s very disrespectful
What should someone do if a fight starts based on your confession about being vulnerable? When your partner instead of just accepting your vulnerability wants to go deeper and this makes you feel under judgement? He just wants to understand, but i just want to be accepted and these questions especially when i am trying to fight my anger seem so inappropriate for that moment
I can not relate to someone who takes out their cellphone before a conversation is over. It's phenomenally rude. That cellphone is going in the toilet.
You know what? The second way of reacting sounded much stronger than the first, childish one. Remaining calm feels like a very both empathic and confident person.
Crying is not just for infants.  Haven't you ever experienced a scene in a movie where an adult cries?  Yes, even adult men... especially men.  It's very moving.  Crying gets you in a different place than the part of your brain that is trying to protect YOURSELF...now you feel protective (compassionate) toward the other person.\n\nAlso, some people below had questions about how to express that someone is hurting you, in a work context.  Here is what I have seen, and does not make the person look weak:  Say, Ouch.  That's it.  Then quickly move on.  There isn't time for the person you are speaking to,  to mount a counter-attack; they might even be slightly confused (they didn't realize the stupidity/insensitivity of what they were saying).  But later they will think back at what they said (because you said Ouch) and they'll get it.
Its hard to identify when the people in the video are so annoying.
I tried scenario two once and got told to not be such a baby, y e a h, that's doesn't work either.
These videos are pretty bad lately.. terrible acting
thank you . this came at the perfect time
I break up usually
What is the background music?
It's so like us..even the topic of conversation
I feel like dealing with the pain of being alone is much easier than dealing with the pain (and annoyance, and stupid bullshit) of being in a relationship.
men have pride ,women have harsh-head ,nothing would work except long time arguing to relieve the stress .... arguing is a solution to say everything you want to say
As a woman, I find vulnerability in men almost invariably attractive. Many feel so much pressure to be stoic or strong that it feels hard to get to know the real person within. So revealing weakness to me feels like a gesture of trust, which I find ultimately flattering. (Egocentric motivation, I suppose 😏 at least in part) I am slow to trust, so the vote of confidence means worlds to me.\n\nHowever, I will admit there are caveats: \n1. When someone has hurt me very badly, and they express guilt or shame upon releazing my hurt, I do feel somewhat satisfied and take pleasure in their pain, but only to the extent that I feel it evens the score (no more than I hurt for no longer than I hurt). This is only in extreme situations.\n2. ‎When people use a facade of honesty as an excuse for being an asshole or venting raw emotion carelessly without any effort towards tact or self-restraint. (Basically launching a personal attack under the guise of just being honest.)\n3. ‎When I feel their expressing hurt is actually a tale of woe aimed at manipulating my emotions intentionally to make me feel sorry for them and reduce their culpability. Or if I notice that particular person seems to have a pervasive victim mentality, even if they are not consciously aware of it. This is frustrating. Taking responsibility is key.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, I can deal with sadness quite well, but not anger. Anger antagonizes, whereas sadness invites empathy.
Naturally, it goes both ways. If someone courageously admits that he/she felt hurt, then you should properly and eagerly listen to them without hitting back.
This shit doesn't work. They will tell you to get over it, a partner that cares about you doesn't do shit they know will upset you unless it is unavoidable.
I wish it were that easy. I'm glad sometimes it is. It should be our first line of defense. It seems though that there are people who watch for that kind of thing to use it. Sociopaths. And if you are with them, well I just don't know if there's any good way to deal with someone who eats off of your vulnerability. Who waits for it and hopes for it to use it against you. \n        I guess if you get a healthy person this is the best way. But if you were predisposed, trained to be in defective relationships from childhood, well it's a bit more complicated. But not to be given up on.... it's just going to take more time and focus to fix all the backwards stuff you were trained to accept.
Yeah. It doesn't work in today's fearful/narcissistic society. It doesn't work. Show your hurt, women leave. Show your hurt, men take advantage of it.
Great acting / depiction of real couple arguments
Sometimes I want angry make up sex, not apologetic tender sex.
When you're a loner but still watch this shit carefully just in case one day someone loves u back and you end up in a relationship
Narcissistic Personality Disorder - Love to see a video on that one - a nightmare condition.
Why am I watching videos about devonping a good relationships when I've never had a relationship and will never get one?
first time clicking on this, i thought it was gus johnson in the thumbnail........................................................
Not working for me.... a person keeps hurting me and refusing to talk to me. No matter if I tell her I'm hurt or if I get mad. She just doesn't care. And I care for her so much. She's my sister, so it's not like I'll ever walk away from her. What can I do but just hurt silently? Addressing what's hurting you isn't always the answer because sometimes the person really is selfish and they aren't going to care.
JACK HOWARD IS IN IT. I SAW THE THUMBNAIL AND COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES!!! <3
He should have just got up and turkey slapped her....
Mind what you say. Words, like bullets, cannot be taken back.
Jack Howard!?! How'd I find you all the way over here?
Hello from Colombia. What about a video of schizophrenia? Causes, treatments and related things? Blessings from Sincelejo.
Jack Howard was a great choice for this video! : )\n\nI think most people are afraid if they show vulnerability, they will be mocked or hurt further. This is a good response to those fears. <3
Being lone is the best the way to avoid these problems.
Beautifully acted. Gave me an anxiety attack.
I wish you would do a video about someone trying to break their habit of being toxically submissive.The kind of quiet self restraint that helps no one in the end.
Ironic how they’re watching Germany Vs. Brazil 😂😂😂🤔🤔🤔🤣🤣🤣
Omg Jack Howard and School of Life crossover. Worlds colliding! 🌏
I lost someone I loved with all my heart when instead of being kind when I felt hurt by him, and explaining this to him nicely, I decided to lash out at him. I lost him. Lesson learned...entirely too late, though. 😞
Jack! I'm super pleased to see you.
I feel like relationship advice from The School of Life represents how ideal people in the ideal world SHOULD behave, rather than useful advice to be used in the real world with real people.
One should sacrifice if you want to understand each other
How do you handle it when you show hurt and they respond by mocking you? Let's also assume that, for the sake of having a real conversation, they are not evil monsters. They just have a difficult time taking emotions and related conversations seriously.
School of Life do you not realize that the lashing out and insulting behavior IS how people show thier hurt? What you are advocating isn't showing people you are hurt but rationally explaining why they feel hurt. Reveling in your negative emotions leads to negative responsess, like insults and attacks. You can not explain to another person why you feel hurt unless you know why yourself. This means taking a moment,  stepping back and examing your emotional state. In this video, in your positive example, the man explains to  the woman why he is hurt he doesn't show it. Most animals lash out after they have been hurt, the hardest part is stopping yourself from that behavior,  and this video does nothing to help with that part.
question: does this have something to do with bad parenting ?
The parallel the guy showed vulnerability by expressing how he was hurt? Well, the “bad” parallel to the “good” parallel would have been if she wasn’t acknowledging and accepted that she hurt him. Sometimes, if you tell someone that they hurt your feelings and how they hurt you, they’ll deny their part and blame you for being “too sensitive/emotional” or “I shouldn’t have to walk around eggshells around you” translation,”I have to think about what I say to you before I say it. I don’t want to be respectful of your thoughts and feelings.” or “Then, I must be the monster or the bad guy.” After, they’ll entice you to fight or argue back with them so they don’t feel like they’re the only monster or bad guy, thus they will push you to say something just as cruel or malicious so they feel they are on equal footing. “Now we’re both hurt, so you can’t say shit else.”
Jack, fancy seeing you here.
I WISH... lól
LOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLL because this how my arguing starts
Clicked because of Jack
JACK HOWARD!!!!
Damn
He is an oversensitive jerk.
also khyan fucking mansley
ditch the bitch
Great advice! ❤️
This is important
Good actors.
JACK HOWARD 4 LYFE!!!
Whaaaat Jack!! Hey man!!!!
Woo jack
Jack! :D
Awesome!!
JACK
Love these👍
I'll tell you exactly what happens when you reveal your emotions to most women:  Awww, man up.  If there's one thing most women in my life couldn't handle its listening to men's emotions, they don't matter and they have the nerve to call US the whinebags at the slightest sign of complaint.
I could be crying my eyes out and my husband wouldn't bat an eye. I hate that narcissist
I'm autistic and even I realise that getting out your phone while someone is trying to talk to you is offensive.  How does that make his ego fragile? Would the  women be fragile if the roles were reversed?\nPlease explain.
This sounds great but, my wife would call me a pussy if I showed my feelings. In fact she has before.
I did that and she said I am not man enough and broke up.
To be quite honest, I'm confused about how emotional intelligence is any different from intellectual intelligence-isn't rational thinking (essentially the type of thinking being endorsed here) a type of intellectual intelligence readily captured in existing IQ tests? We acknowledge that there is some kind of emotional disturbance, but choose to suppress or ignore it for the sake of rational thought and behavior. How is this type of thought different from the type of thinking required to decide to pull a train track switch to save 5 people instead of doing nothing and saving one?
I do have a request: please show your texts a little longer. You write such important notes and it is hard for me as a non native speaker to read them in Time. Pausing kinda destroys the Flow. Thx.
tbh Ella seemed more into nick kroll than the dudes on tinder
can I have Boris' phone number?
6:35 I just cringed into the next dimension
dommy d did it better and first
Do one of these with Jason Mantzoukas
I love these so much!! More Tinder Takeovers!!!
Nothing will every beat Eric Andres episode
Ella, if you're looking for a short guy.. let me know.
boris said he's getting too old and the word fuckboi in the same sentence
After seeing the Eric Andre one these all suck
I'm in love.
I NEED TO KNOW HOW THINGS WENT WITH BORIS!
Why the fuck is this so entertaining? 😂
I'm laughing so hard. omg this is hysterical
a guy that works out like once a week bitch that person does not exist and if he does he probably has the bmi of seth rogen
I loved this haha, this should be a show or something with nick as the host
Aww, this has been my favorite one of these
LOOL I could watch him mediate people's Tinder profiles for daysssss
All I want to do is find out what the guy would do if he could change the alphabet
Yesssss Nick Kroll is the best
That chortle at 4:10...\nI'd reply to a DM from you, Nick. \nYou're not quite old enough to be my daddy so I can assure you that's at least one awkward moment we won't have.
HOW WAS YOUR LABOR DAY
Only Nicks with a k are allowed. I love the tribute photo to you and John and I would've guessed old ladies as well if it weren't for the tuna.
It's based off our names.
I love his advice at the end basically.... its so very true .... i love Nick Kroll so much, even more now
Her voice and laugh is amazing
9:58 - this guy likes The Grateful Dead. Still   //  Savage.
7:32 my thoughts and prayers to my man Stefan. He never had a chance.
Still waiting for one of these videos with the genders reversed.. Seriously, I can't imagine half of the shit that is said in this video getting a laugh with the genders reversed.
Haven't laughed so much in a *long* time
Boris really needs to get over his grammar fetish.
i really wanna see ella and boris go on a date they seem to have a nice sense of humour
He's the nicest one they've had on there. Also can't use a phone.
Once a week haha what a strange way to describe the kind of physical set you're looking for in a man.
This guy likes the Grateful Dead. STILL hahaha omg I love it
God, I love Nicky Kroll.
Excellent!
Wow you swiped left on the Asian without any comment.
11:11 minutes long.

Best one yet!
Are they getting hooked up or what? I'm pretty sure he was flirting, and she liked that shit.
That's the least assholey I've seen Nick Kroll act.
Bryan, 25. Phish, The Grateful Dead.... First pic is me and the best  mom in the world at a show. We go to a ton of concerts together HAHA, Tinder is fucking full of weirdos
Y'all see that tuna?
I wanted to see what her friend answered back

What a nice guy Nick is.
😂 nope that's been on my tinder ellaaa.. OH HELLO BE MY FRIEND ELLA
this guy's not funny irl & it's sad because you can tell he tries really hard unlike eric andre
Nick Kroll is a national treasure.
Can you imagine if you saw yourself on this video haha
He starts talking about how it's okay to mess up on a text right after he sent one that started with I will I am tall.
why does his forehead look like a hydraulic press crushed it
Hey, I don't have kids . But I'll put one in ya 😂😂💀
I'd pay to see Tinder Takeover with Jeff dunham
Man I haven't laughed this hard in ages!
Did....did he just say Cyrano de Borat? Okay, I'm in love.
Nick Kroll is a savage.
When u gotta pretend like you've never used tinder
Boris really out here making moves.
Who watches Big Mouth!!!😂❤️
I just realized that I have a crush on Nick Kroll. wow

This shit is genius. The concept of the video just adds to that.
Hollyshittt !!! At 3:07 you can see Natsuki Hanae aka the voice actor of Ken Kaneki from Tokyo Ghoul and 9S from Nier Automata
really cool to see this!
The Vice dude'has real big hair.
he seem like a chill dude
Oh lord a Japanese Coon
Why Americans always brings up race?
I THOUGHT THAT WAS JOSH FROM JKFILMS
I knew it, it's the new guy from Oha Star, yes, I love that guy! 😂❤️👍🏾
He said it right..Japanese are not racist they just don't know much about other cultures. Can't really blame them..it comes with time. It will get better.
It felt weird seeing two black guys speak Japanese to each other whilst both knowing they know fluent English. No racism, just never saw that, I love it.
havent i seen this before?
The open seat thing on the train is the same in Scandinavia.
Foreigners speaking Japanese is so attractive to me
I swear I thought this guy was Josh from Just kidding news.
Yeah, I also have the weird issues with no one wanting to sit beside me because I am a foreigner (I thought it was because I smelled different).  Despite that, living in Japan is good and there are a lot of excellent opportunities if you know how to sell yourself. And he's doing a good job of it. \n\nIn the past, there were some other famous black comedians like Bobby and the guy that was really good at singing enka. There are a lot of passing fads and comedians... staying in the limelight is always really hard. \n\nAlso, I have lived here off and on for about 15 years and within the last say 5 years or so there has been a major increase in the number of foreigners and tourists due to the visa restrictions being removed on a lot of Asian countries.
日本には肌の色での差別はないです。あるのは、日本人と外国人の区別だけです。\n\n日本のローカルな地方では外国人とコミュニーケーションを取る機会がまだまだ少ないです。なので、外国人はとても珍しいので、見られることはあるでしょう。避けられる事もありますが差別ではなく戸惑いです。それは、言語の問題など含め、コミュニーケーションを取る方法が思いつかないからです。\n日本人は排外的とイメージされますが、外国人が日本に観光に来る事は歓迎をしているのが多数派です。外国人が嫌いと言うことはないのです。\nまして、黒人だからという理由は無いです。\nただ黒人さんは仕事を探して来日する者も多く、より稼ごうと犯罪に絡む場合もあり印象を悪くさせている場合があります。アジア系や中東系も同じです。\n白人系は観光客が大半なので比較的に印象が良いままです。\nそのような印象の差はあると思います。
A rare pokemon... lol.
watching two african-american speaking japanese is unbeliveably priceless :'''DDD
MUST CATCH SHINY BLACK GUY
This guy is awesome and he's talented. Not much to do with his skin color to become a celebrity.
 he's a rare Pokemon LMFAO
What they don't tell you is that they make him act dumb all the time, sane with Bobby Olugun, and the other Black famous actors on Japan, to poke fun at Black people so it isn't as good as they make it seem
Sweet talk, “I don’t think Japanese are racists”. Dream on! Try to settle in Japan outside the world of entertainment ....
Damn, these Vice reporters know so many languages it blows my mind. I can barely handle one, and they seem to know whatever needs to be spoken.
I wish you could go into even more depth. Double this segment! Maybe Japan is more use to seeing white guys, but over in China that wasn't the case for me. Everyone would stare at me like I'm a walking museum. I would have people ask if they could take a picture with me at least once a week. Mind you, I wasn't living in the big major cities (Bejing, Shanghai, Guangdong). They'd get weirded out even more when I'd start speaking in Mandarin. They'd still try speaking English to me even when I'd respond in Mandarin. I definitely get what he's saying about the 'train thing' and no one sitting next to you. It's a bit weird...
Sadly no one will remember him by this time next year, like the formerly famous Atsugiri Jason.
Japanese :  oh my god, it a nergo
I'm not surprised, Nigerians are a vibrant community in Japan. If I recall I know of a Nigerian boxer whose a daytime talkshow host there and is also fluent in Japanese. I forgot his name but some may know it.
Breaking racial barriers in Japan. Very cool.
@0:18 \nRick? Is that you?
Boy! 2017, Trump is President and this guy is getting famous in Japan, anything is possible! Tune in next week to meet the juggling gay amputee couple that're taking Russia by storm!
Congrats on being made fun of dude
REALLY good video. I had NO idea things were like this over there.
Bruh I respect your story and everything but what is up with that line up my guy? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
That is weird, I've now seen 3 black guys speaking fluent Japanese in less than a week. 2 on this video, & one on some PBS show about Japanese textiles.
>used to work for goldman sachs\nKILL THE BOURGEOISIE
Japan here I come
Japanese would be smart to kick him out
Nothing special about it. Just one black dude being on Japanese tv show. So what?  Yes, of course he should be able to speak Japanese he lives in Japan.
Can I find a video on YouTube with racist comments from white people ??
What a bunch of weaboos
Dang, they're still sporting jheri curls in Japan.
Hell no not this long hair dude again. Viceeeeeeeeeeeeee
Still an outsider who is nothing but a clown
I am very surprised when I hear the host speak Japanese, because I just heard him speak mandarin in the higher brothers video. Like I'm native chinese and have learnt japanese for 4 years and its obvious that this Dexter's Mandarin and Japanese are native level, like he doesnt even have that foreigner accent
“They don’t know how to do black hair” 😂💀.
Whyd they bringin whites into this. Bruv it meant to be black vs asians.
This is awesome 👏🏽 you gotta start somewhere and yes kids tv is probably the best place.
pokemon or no pokemon, get that money bruuuuh!
The hair and pokeman comment was funny! Lol
I just wanna know how the women are treating him over there ;)
There’s that chef hat hairdo again. Lose it already. It’s your job to report the news not be the news!
This vice guy is way funnier than the guy in the video. And not just in japan, his brand of humor transends all borders and barriers.
He's a rare pokemon. 😂
Japanese people Don't Know is the WEAKEST excuse I have ever heard.
They basically be shinies
why so short vice?
Isn't this video a replay from like five months ago?
2 black guys speaking fluent japanese. I love this
I can be famous just for being black and speaking japanese.\n\n*on the fucking plane now*
this guy is too cool
Ok why is japan bad for not accepting so many foreigners??
the thing is Japanese girls like BBC
It may seem irrelevant but I must point out that on the daytime show oha sta he is the only male on the set wearing something ridiculous! Baby steps for equality I assume....
This will give a lot of filthy weeaboos  hope lmao.
Not only this guy but both Jero an Enka singer and Chris Hart  a J-pop singer are accepted and very popular in Japan as well.\nJapanese people might be xenophobia on the whole for sure, but seems like most of them are not racist.\nJust examine the Art Blakey's anecdote, or W.E.B.Du Bois' column he wrote for The Pittsburgh Courier.
they are not racists they just don't know wtf
A Brain and a Shell. The Brain can be trained to do anything. But we can't look pass the Shell, The Color.
dont accept multiculturalism japan, you'll regret it
I am sick and tired of hearing about this multiculturalism bullshit everyday! Stop! just STOP!!!
*I get the impression they're laughing at him, not with him.*\nI'm also getting the impression that he knows that and Vice knows this, and they tried to film this in a way that didn't show that.
to black guys speaking Japaneses in Japan thats a big deal
niggu?\nneegeiru?
What a trailblazer!
That's funny seeing two black dudes conversing in Japanese. \n\nそれは会話2人の黒い男を見て面白いです
誰こいつ？
Guys the original Weaboo
Impressive! Keep on keeping on!
Haha that Pokemon joke cracked me up bad 😂😂😂
Both these niggas wild for these hairstyles
4:30 nigga please hahaha
Same shit in Estonia tho
this dude seems like a caricature smfh
I like him.
In American black people are pokemon...why you think police and prisons are always tryin to catch em all?!
good for you brotha! ✊🏾
My god shes beatiful
He has nice lips
He a mark
My cousin live in japan (shes black), when she goes out into the public people ask her Can i touch your skin? or Can i touch your kids?. What do you think about that?
*Two homosexual black I guess*
No racist but class segregation  & discrimination, which is unfortunate in Japan.\nAlso Japanese shop owners are subject to yakuza protection. Women are still 2nd class.\nGood & bad in Japan.
I greatly respect anyone who paves the way for diversity and give talented people a platform despite what others may say about it.
Many people hate perfumes in Japan. So when you come to Japan for sightseeing, we hope in half of usual.
if i remember correctly there was a black samurai that worked for oda nobunaga and people from all around japan would go to see him to the point where some people got trampled to death, i think some servants of nobunaga when they first met tried to see if they could wash the black off of him, probably need some fact checking on that but im pretty sure those are things that happend
you'll see, when Africa will be 4 times more populated by the end of this century, you'll regret to call them rare pokemon : Visiting Europe you'll only see blacks.
They forgot to ask him the most important question. Who in the right mind leaves Goldman Sachs for some talent agency?
Nigga stole ma bike
Leave Japan for the Japanese\nbad reputation for accepting foreigners doesn't have the best reputation for diversity\nHow are those bad things? Diversity is cancer. Japan is better without africans and arabs
日本語字幕も出してもらえたら嬉しかったです。
Thank you for this funny video!
Rhett's hair is the most mythical thing on the set. Man his hair is beautiful
Link was NOT wearing that GMM shirt the entire time. LOL.
Admit it, who else looked back to see if link was wearing the shirt before?
u r from NC and u don't know what apple butter is?  Yuppie LOL
I'm new to this channel is there people laughing in the background??and why?
you should try to figure out the best brand of vanilla ice cream !!!
You guys should do a will it tamale!
Pumpkin ice cream from traders joes is the best
Great way to wake up laughing!

I don't like mint chocolate chip ice cream but LOVE pumpkin spice
Dose anybody else think why is Rhett not in the thumbnail it's always likn
You can give pumpkin to a dog for constipation
Glad you are all making money and stuff.... But just stop. Let this show be a good thing, before it turns into desperate.
The donation was so nice 😭💓💓
5:45 My dog was on a pumpkin only diet for a while for medical reasons, so yeah, dogs eat pumpkin.
Hey mythical crew, you guys rock and are one of the main reasons gmm is such a great thing; without your skills and everything you do on and off camera the show wouldn't have the same quality, emotions, and vibes. Keep it up guys and don't  get discouraged by rude people that forget they are insulting real people and are not aware of everything you guys do.
They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy, but we go where we want to. Anyone? No? No one gets the reference?
isnt it that dogs shouldnt eat pumpkin? Or is it pumpkin seeds? :/
I wonder if a pallet cleanser between tastings would have affected the level of pumpkin spice detected.  It's possible the flavor on the dog biscuits and other stuff was lost from some of the other stuff they had already eaten.
i love pumpkins i love the smell of pumpkin spice. but i hate the taste unless its in a pie or in frozen yogurt is anyone with me🎃🎃🎃
Went out and bought the Joe Joes after watching ... yum!
Is it me or was link rushing and being kinda rude?
I like your intro
Thanks for donating to UNICEF. Talk about being your mythical best!
So terrible to talk about cows like their lives mean nothing. The science is in: meat-eating is not sustainable. It's ruining our planet with methane, animal waste run-off and tailing ponds (see Barcelona's drinking water problem), resource depletion, and deforestation (40% of crops in the US are grown JUST to feed livestock). There are plenty of tasty, cruelty-free alternatives and absolutely no excuse to stick to a tradition that is pointless and harmful to this planet. And before you even mention health aspects, learn some basic biology (e.g. how proteins are formed, what essential nutrients are, how vitamers are metabolized) before looking like an uneducated fool.
Why do I get the feeling that that was the ONLY roadside coffee pot in America...
That pumpkin butter is basically ginger butter. It’s disgusting.
puerto rico is not a country..
I don't know why people are complaining about the crew laughing in fact to me and all of my friends it makes it feel Lively not just two people commentating it gives it a more TV show feel I like it and I think they shouldn't stop them from laughing
A piece of me died when Link tore open the pumpkin bagel bag instead of opening from the top!
2:05 - can you research greek-yogurts-popularity-is-harmful-to-the-environment please?
Dogs do eat pumpkin it is very good for them. Give them canned pumpkin for tummy troubles especially BTW...if anyone cares to know....
I'm only mad that they didn't do the pumpkin cereal
The pumpkin dog treats is for dogs who are constipated haha! It should be a regular thing in the pet area
Actually I like when the crew laughs
i immediately started clapping when they announced that they were donating the money to help people in puerto rico.
i LOVE the crew and all... but I do have to agree the laughs got a little annoying
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
Everyone in the comments: The crew should stop laughing at funny things gOD\n\nMe: * laughs at everything Rhett and Link say *
I have never had any pumpkin spice product nor have I had any trader joes product.
They make all sorts of pumpkin based dog treats, and I think they purposely don't make the pumpkin noticeable.\n\nI get them for my rabbits, because the treats are vegan (bunnies don't eat meat) and full of stuff rabbits can have in moderation. They often come in fruit flavors, like apple, blueberry and banana.\n\nBut I think advertising the dog treatsas a pumpkin treat for fall is a gimmick. I suspect the treats taste the same. The pumpkins blend in with the rest of the flavors.
I broke my foot at my football game
Dogs actually love pumpkin and some added to their dog food helps harden poops if your dog is having the runs 😁 it's also just good for them in general if given the right amount
My mom and her husband just makes me feels weird...
Is that a jojo's reference?
My mom bought so many of the pumpkin things at traders Joes... I laughed at her when she showed all of them.
Watching this on Yom Kippur and I'm starving to death
During taste tests, Link is always high on something.....
GIMME ALL THE PUMPKIN!!!🎃🎃🎃🎃
I love pumpkin pie. I despise pumpkin spice. It tastes nasty.
I appreciate crew laughter
I feel completely indifferent towards pumpkins 😂
10:56 Not really...\nNext episode tho, then they got high...
Let's see Stevie and Lizzie take it up the ass!
my dog loves pumpkin! one time we got a bumy pumkin and she kept biting the bumps off XD
hay friends please watch my video too :)\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhYxwVJBszQ&t=84s
u change so much
Kinda winging it here with the “pumpkin spice” thing - most of these items are just pumpkin flavour. 😕
He said tortiLLa the first time...
I love how serious Rhett takes things some of the time, and then there is Link, who is just kinda there and going along with whatever is happening. Kinda like a golden retriever, handsome, but not very bright.
Who's up for Starbucks
I see Trader Joes and I click. Literally.
We all know pumpkin spice is made by the mole people using their feet. USDA uses that Obama water that makes the frogs gay to clean off the dirt
i am so done with this pumpkin spice every thing  crazy
oldest giant coffe potin north america\n\ngirl i think you mean the only one
My mo makes pumpkin soup out of pumpkin butter along with some extra spices and it's sooooooooooooo good.
All of Link’s dinks today were so aggressive
Half these things aren't even pumpkin spice. They're just 'pumpkin'... there is a difference lol\n\nfun though
When Rhett stops the wheel on Gifticality and mentions Hurricane Maria 😢
I will never get the pumpkin spice hype... this video just showed that most of these are hella unnecessary and might not even taste good... 😂
It's Halloween!!! 2spoopy4me
Try the trader joe’s pumpkin pop tarts
Wow. Trader Joe sure likes pumpkins!
My mom's husband \nyou mean your dad?  lmao
Haha, they're so comfortable with each other :) A great episode!
I love that they’re helping the people of Puerto Rico, nothing but respect for my presidents
Hi subscrbe
pumpkin spice pumpkin
earth is flat
Rhett looks like Hugh jakmans, Logan
I just realized that link looks like my paster at church 😊😂
You guys realize there is generic laughing in every facet of this type of comedy? Aside from movies everything you've watched has had laughing in the background. I hate people.
I think there should be some complaint filed to Trader Joe's about those dog treats, false advertising and all. Probably didn't think anyone would eat them.
feed your dog pumpkin to help with constipation
Come over to our house \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe don't live together\n\n\n\n\n\nHmmm
there is a HUGE difference between pumpkin flavored and pumpkin spice. Pumpkin Spice is the spices you use in making a pumpkin pie like cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and ginger, and sometimes, allspice  it does not contain pumpkin flavor how dumb do you have to be to not know that??
Anyone else watching and reading comments
Marathi new pictucter

How come when I go to primark all I can find is a pair of two different sized shoes and a ugly jumper
Babe you should try on the items so we can see what they look like on you!!! :D <3
Pointless to do a haul if you're not trying things on 😰
Why does this girl get so much hate she seems nice enough?
anyone else think she looks like Lauren Goodger ????
LOVED this vid as I can never find the good stuff in primark (it's like searching for diamonds in A LOT of rough) - gonna head to Primange v soon now!! Can you pleasee do a Zara haul? Think you'd find lots of great stuff, not just casuals but also for going out/clubbing (throw back to the Zara white lace bralette you wore a few years ago or something) xxx
I never ever go in primark, cos the last time I went in was literally like 7 years and it was terrible but now I think it seems to have got so much better!
What I wanna know is have you not watched pulp fiction?! Xxxxx
Random but where did you purchase your sofa? On a hunt for a new one
Love this! I also uploaded a haul today - all Zara stuff! :D

I live in Germany and my boyfriend lives in England and he looked in Primark for me to find that gorgeous grey coat and he couldn't find it 💔😭 I love it, it looks so expensive! Maybe when I next go to England they will have it in a different Primark 😊
She looks so much like Imogen 😂
The Pulp Fiction t-shirt doesn't just say Pulp Fiction on it and it has a lady. Pulp Fiction is one of the best Tarantino movies. Highly recommended :)
Get into the video 0.27 seconds and already subscribed💞
I need those burgundy heels & that royal blue handbag! Obsessed 😍
Wish you had done prices for everything
I need to go to  primark 😭 thank u love
So true about the thongs 😂 think I own every colour! Loved this xx
Those court shoes are a major Gianvito Rossi dupe... ☺️👍🏻
I was in London a week ago, and  of course I went to Primark and buy and buy and buy a lot of clothes, I was so happy in that store.
Can I ask which ring light you use? I really want to get one but I don't know which one to get haha
Wish you'd model them as well 😉
Are you ok? Like is everything alright at home? 😂 But you're right, those 3 pack underwear sets are so fab
Darling,where is this Pink Floyd t shirt from,it looks gorgeous on you

Great haul, i really need to go to primark 😱🙌🏼💕✨
fan girled a little over Pink Floyd haha x
Hi Sarah where is your ring light from? Xxx
£200 is like what most people spend anyway
Love your channel ❤️ it was kinda difficult to see items like the jumpers that you were holding
Whenever I go to primark I never find anything 🤦🏽‍♀️😭
Would you do a video on what you do to stay so slim? I know you've had a bit of a shape up journey and I'm struggling with it a bit at the mo! 💘
Those 3 sets of underwear are life Sarah. Love that you get them too hahah

Loved the clothes but so distracted how you keep looking down to your right - what's down there? Just curious! Also, slight stuck up vibes about Primark .. you can't tell it's from Primark - the comment about men was hilarious though!
Men are just pains in the arse's 😂😂
AHHHHH😱 I'm literally poor and spend like £500 shopping for clothes and stuff, primark must be cheap af! Heading to Oxford Street this weekend
Why the fuck would anyone spend £200 in primark?
Amazing babe ❤ would love to see more haul style videos from you!!
So size 12 girls are super big and oversized and you're too good for primark.....good message 👌🏻
Tomorrow I'm putting at least 15mn of deleted scenes on Patreon - and I will be quitting my Patreon campaign pretty soon. Last chance to jump on! http://www.Patreon.com/JoeGoes
Juggalos are the weird kid in school, all grown up.
these people are fucking great
I may not be a fan of ICP, but im a huge fan of freedom!
joe, please don't leave us
God, I bet D.C. stunk for days...
i was all for  juggalos to be who they waan be but then the  ignorant  anti trump comments  came along and  yup,they are  nothing more than abunch of ignorami
They may be a little weird but they seem harmless.
“so far so good, no heroin in the dick vein yet...”
Juggaloes are nice people, but they are really, really stupid. Seriously, I'm not joking, if you are open minded or a very accepting person. They are seriously lacking in intelligence generally speaking. Just listen to the music. It's unquestionably retarded. No one can or will challenge me on this. I am right. Goodbye retarded but nice juggaloes. Listen to someone smarter than you .
Honestly It's hypocritical ; they listen to horrorccore  rap which describes beheading people,  stabbing people, collecting heads, and murdering children yet they claim to be the nicest people on earth liker one big family, it's really stupid.half of these motherfuckers are obviously on hard drugs; yeah real great culture to raise your kids in :/. bTW looks like violent Jay lost a lot of weight ;)
Sounds like furries trying to justify their degeneracy.
It's all about love, acceptance, and family. Their Family.  I know some juggalos and I'm different from them and they ignore me or call me names for not agreeing with everything they do. I'm Disabled so it feels good to be hated for no reason.
Thank you for this joe.... I mean dad
Holy fuck that ginger was annoying
14:48 *Joe Gets* a really Genuine Hug
Yes everyone is accepted except \nFuck you, fuck me, fuck us\nFuck tom, fuck Mary, fuck Gus\nFuck dairies\nFuck the west coast\nAnd fuck everybody on the east\nEat shit and die\nOr fuck off at least\nFuck pre-schoolers\nFuck rulers\nKings and queens and gold jewelers\nFuck wine coolers\nFuck chickens, fuck ducks\nEverybody in your crew sucks\nPunk muthafucks\nFuck critics\nFuck your review\nEven if you like me, fuck you!\nFuck your mom\nFuck your mom's mom\nFuck the Beastie Boys and the Daili Llama\nFuck the rain forest\nFuck a Forest Gump\nYou probably like it in the rump\nFuck a shoe pump\nFuck the real deal\nAnd fuck all the fakes\nFuck all fifty two states, oooh\nAnd fuck you
Didn't know people would be so open with their clown fetish
Most of these people are bullshitting. The gang label is neither here nor there. It is an excuse for publicity and a concert. Which is fine by the way. I can see people had fun.
whats with your anti trump bullshit, you being a fanboy and saying what you think they want to hear? guess what, cupcake, trump isnt the one trying to deny free speech, the fucking antifa and leftist scum are, and i would think juggalos would be about free speech. Btw i could see how uncomfortable you were around them, maybe you should stick to the suburbs and grab ass with your antifa buddies. lame.
17:28 When two reds meet there can be only \n\n\n\n💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
They all look like they smell like cigarettes
I'm a simple man, I see a Joe Goes, I click
0:37 I am not a gang member, I am a Christian. \n\nGo fuck yourself fanatic
white boi in the jacket with the tie sounds kinda like slipknot's lead singer when he's speaking
insane clown president was actually pretty fucking funny
I respect ICP for what they have achieved, all the while being the least talented rappers ever to grab a microphone.  Malibus most wanted guy was like kendrick compared to them lol.  I always praise them for what they have accomplished.  Hustle and flow......minus the flow. They have an incredible work ethic and believe in what their doing.  But juggalos calling the FBI inbred.......C'MON MAN!  If you take half of all the juggalos that gather each year at the festival.  And sign them up with ancestry.com. Id bet they all come from 5 different blood lines MAX.  The ancient Jugalos defs succeeded in keeping that blood line pure.  So much so, that when one hot woman attended the gathering they through their shit on her! (admit it.......tila tequila was once hot)  Inbred see.....inbred do!
if you go to a trump rally there's a high probability to be hurt or killed but if you go to a juggalo march you just get high as fuck and a 2 liter of faygo
This was everything I wanted and more. What a community and what a video
I hate literally everyone filmed in this video.
Jesus, who let the ginger out of his closet.
whoop whoop! fresh as fuck ninja, lookin forward to the outtakes.
ALL I WANT IS A FAT BITCH NAMED BRIDGETTE
I learned something today...  Juggalos are actually pretty cool.  Wow.  Still don't know how magnets work, but I do believe in miracles now.
That redhead kid just needs a friend
People don't even know what juggalettes and juggaloes even are. *Listens to what is a juggaloe by ICP. Well they sound like lovely people.
we love you, Joe.
WHO DID YOU VOTE FOR?!?! @joegoes most underrated channel
1. Joe has BARS\n2. Girl with the hat and dreads is adorable
I BETTER BE IN THE FUCKIN' VIDEO
If you have a Hatchet on your car , you deserve to be pulled over.
Wow....the first time I heard of insane clown posse was back in 96’, s dude from my work was into them, I listened to them for 5 minutes and all they talked about was clown life and hacking up people ....I guess rapping about drugs and gang life is more tolerable....ISP is laughable and demented.
Have to say they seem like pretty nice folks.
You looked so done with that ginger dude haha!
Ruining my reputation by proving there are more literate juggalos than just myself?!  For shame!
THIS GUY SOUNDS LIKE HE IS DEEP THROATING BLACK DICKS WITH A FIST UP HIS ASS
Joe made it on trending... Thats a start. .3.
Juggalos are cool people. One of the only people I kept in contact with after high school is a Juggalo. He doesn't drink, doesn't do drugs and works with at risk kids. He was one of the only people who had the balls to call me on my shit about my Heroin use. Went to the Gathering with him a couple years back, it was so much fun. I don't care for ICP, but most Juggalos are pretty decent people.
I got the Juggalo juice ! I still listen to the music,  such good fun , I'm down with the Clown ! 😂😂😍😍❤ Respect ICP😍❤
Fittest bunch up in the cut
Mankini makes it look like a gay pride parade and nope..it makes a joke of what juggalo was when I started..... Mne !!!
I am the Juz Bling. Thanks Joe!\nHere's some of my music!\nhttps://youtu.be/XkHx2Bewj9c
Where the fuck you have been JOE?
Thank you for this upload joe
Why you have to get all political every time?
props for still makin quality vids even though all of them are basically demonetized
Someone please tell these people the difference between a hatchet and a meat cleaver
This is honestly one of the best darn videos I've ever seen on youtube. These jeffalos are so sweet and Joe is good at doing his program Joe Goes.
the juggalos seem a lot more rational than trumptards.
I could see LBJ being a Juggalo
TO THE JUGGALO at 1:54 what other fanbase has been discriminated like that? Oh Manson Fans got blamed for Columbine, Judas Priest got blamed and sued for those kids shooting their faces off with a shotgun, and Slayer fans get pretty much blamed for being satanists every day soooo stop bitching
8:07 Gabe has to go home.
I only know Joe as the normy who gets amongst the Ninjas. Legendary Buttery Mother Fucker.
9:52 I’m the guy in the back petting the dog
they're a bunch of fucking weirdos but at least they embrace it and roll with the stereotypes, bit of respect for that
5:56 carti carti carti
Bunch of losers
Wtf are these inbreds on about
RAP LOL
oh shit
WHOOP WHOOP!!!!!!!
Clownworld
Working class unity!

Your trending!
Joe looking buff now
nice.
3:05 whoop whoop
Whoop whoop
Bring back the flickering text!
You deserve more subscribers
3 STRIKE Juggalo, black, and MALE.
A gang of people that average $15k-$22k a year. AKA losers, Burger King employees. Food stamps, WIC, Section 8... Poor white trash. Minimalism at it's finest.
one of those autistic wiggers is actually carrying the communist flag of trailertrashistan...thank you lol.
DAE Trump supporters suck??? We get it joe, you're a triggered SJW bud.
Stop calling people racist you stupid fuck, because you obviously do not know what that means.
BOI!\nTime's Arrow was AMAZING! I never wanna forget that episode!
Please say, Well, I won't back down. No, I won't back down. You can stand me up at the gates of hell But I won't back down. for Tom Petty
Please say, all you had to do was catch the damn train
The first season was so uneven that Denise Crosby freaked out and left too soon.
Sub Rosa, the episode where Crusher masturbates to her space ghost lover.  And you know who directed it?  Jonathon Frakes, aka Will Riker, the horniest first officer in the fleet!  LOL
You folks should do Circle of Iron SO much good stuff.
Phantom of the opera!!
DO JIGSAW!!! when it comes out
Just do the incredibles already!
Say: Christ on a bike.
Well given you did not claim there were any errors I do not have to make a response to this  but you know that Rascals and Times Arrow are a really good. Mark Twain on the Enterprise was awesome.
Please do the original alien
Please do the Underworld franchise.
Do an honest trailer of blood in blood out love that movie
I'll never forget, 7 years ago, I randomly heard my sister say something about 'That Kardassian ass', and I was SO confused! I'm thinking... 'Well the Cardassians aren't a species I'd be looking at their ass of but.... whatever works!
Worf no longer got his ass kicked in DS9 though! He did the ass wiping!
Interestingly, that shirt-straightening tic was referred to a the Picard Maneuver in one of the novels (the one with the Borg).\n\nAnd the first couple of seasons were a little closer to the original series' campiness (Armin future Quark Shimerman as the loud verse-spouting face of a treasure chest, anybody).
I think we need Star Wars Rebels now.  I can get you started...\n\nSTARRING:\nPeople yelling at other people telling them to leave them behind and go.\nPeople yelling at the previous people telling them that they won't leave them behind.\nDramatic starship steering (i.e. Lots of shots of pilots (mostly Hera) dramatically pulling back on the yoke.)\nStormtroopers missing things.\nLightsaber brandishing.\nKanan making you wonder if he's really blind at all.\nChopper indiscriminately trying to kill people/things.\n\n\nP.S.  I like Rebels.  These are just some themes I've noticed. Join the fun and add some of your own.  ;)
Do PHANTOM OF THE OPERA!!
I really DID want to watch the new Star Trek series, but I'm not subscribing to CBS All Access or Netflix for just one show.  Real dick move on their part.  Not the part where you have to subscribe to watch, but the part where they let us watch the first episode on CBS to give us a little taste, hoping to tempt us.  LOL, instead of being drug dealers, they're SHOW dealers.  Jerks.
I have been watching this series again recently. I never really warmed to it but wanted to give it another try. I think Frakes, (Riker) has to be the worst actor ever. Perfect example, Series 1 episode 7. Hide and Q. He.. is.. just.. so.. wooden.  .
When we getting one for Kimi no Nawa or Your Name?
Do Monster's University
And do Good Will Hunting as well, dammit!
Worf getting his ass kicked made me laugh harder than I should've.
This was surprisingly toothless, yet showed the respect one ought to have for TNG.
How did I never notice the 'Riker Maneuver'? I watched this series at least 20 times starting in 1987. lol
Marina needs to understand we didn't hate TNG in the first season, we hated Troy.
Please say I'm going to break you. LIKE A KIT KAT BAR!
In honor of Tom Petty, please say I'm learning to fly, but I ain't got wings.
Are we sure this is as good as we remember? Exactly this.
Next Gen was my favorite star trek series
...and porks him 'til he reanimates her dead grandmother's corpse...
honest trailer for death note the movie
Please say, It's too hard to pick one Tom Petty lyric to quote, so instead, Rest In Peace, Tom.
writers fell asleep on their keyboard !!
how have they not done rick nd morty yet
Screen junkies should do the emojii movie because that film sucks. There isn't even a meh emojii in the message app
so bad but still one of the best things to ever grace tv
jump forward to 4:54 nip city!
Say Into the great wide open / Under them skies of blue\nOut in the great wide open / A rebel without a clue.\nRest in Peace, Tom.
That decides it...... Kirk, definitely Kirk.
Please say Kept you waiting, huh? in your oh so awesome voice.
Do Blade Runner!
Dislike for advertising
Rick and Morty Honest Trailer please :)
Do buffy
Do Jeepers Creepers 1,2,and 3 🙌🙌
Still no Spider-Man homecoming honest trailer?
HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA!
Klingons totally laugh.
next voyager  do it
LOL @ The Riker Maneuver
well done
Do spiderman homecoming for us
More it sore......(tee-hee)
Do Spider-Man Homecoming
Say I did naht
This just makes me want to watch TNG again.
i never had a chocolate that i did not like. How did i miss that! crying here :D :D
loved the Kardashians lol nearly fell of me chair
Do Now You See Me :D
Do an Honest Trailer for Firefly
Haha, I don't think Kirk ever resolved a dispute by quoting a treaty subsection in his entire career....
The Crusher space ghost rape episode is so bizarrely terrible.
I've never noticed the Riker maneuver!
Do an honest trailer for Blade Runner!
I cried with laughed when you at falling asleep on the keyboard bit. Thanks for that, I needed it
you make an honest trailer for tng and you leave out Tasha Yar? for shame screen junkies, for shame.
do a star trek tos one please
I didn't really hear much after the Kardashian/Cardassian mix up!
Please say: Frankly, my dear, I don't give a spam.
Had the serious hots for Dr. Beverly Crusher, but that episode was atrocious.\nCould have also pointed out how Worf's suggestions, which usually involved attack first and ask questions later, were ALWAYS dismissed.
I loved the rascals episode growing up. \nPicard is the best, btw\nI don't even remember that Crusher ghost ep at all...
Dude, the one where they turn into kids is one of the best ever.
Can you please do an honest trailer for the show MASH.
You should do Honest Trailers for IT (2017)
DO voyager aka the one with the best captain becouse she is the only psycho captain ever
Troi's dress at 4:54 Makes me remember why puberty was a challenge.. She was and still is a gorgeous woman..
say: AT&T is the best unlimited network
One extraordinary thing about Picard is that while his superiors were either corrupt, incompetent, blinded by prejudice, etc he always stuck to his principles and found a way to come out of tricky situations in ways that didn't compromise his integrity.
I thought the Riker Maneuver was where he puts his foot up on the helm control next to the pilot.
Can you do a honest trailer on the movie Powder
And here this whole time I thought the Riker maneuver was him putting one leg onto things :-)
This whole thing was just so much awesome.Thanks
Oh shit.. I never realised how Riker sits on chairs like that..
Poor Worf! They did the same thing to Superman in the Timmverse Justice League. The showrunners want to convey how powerful a threat is, so they have it beat-up their strongest character right off the bat. Shows that the threat is tough, but if you do it enough, it makes your strong character look weak.
Shove Crusher out the airlock.
Please do arrow
Do RWBY!
SUPERNATURAL!!!!
Please do IT
Wtf so funny
Do 2017 IT honest trailer
Say: Oh sexy giiiiiiirlfriiiiiiend!
THEA FOHA LIGHTSS!
Review Do Prelude to Axanar.
watch #WynonnaEarp
Palm Punches!
Engage the Picard Maneuver!
tbh I cried too...idk but there's something soooo special about babies and when parents finally meet them after giving birth
I have a bed sheet similar to the shirt lmao
I feel like now Josh and Gabie gonna have to have a baby as Juno's companion, it would be amazing to see them grow together!
I could imagine the emotions <3 They've been together for so long <3

주노의 탄생을 축하드립니다. 정말 사랑스러운 딸이네요
누가 제 광대좀 내려줘요ㅠㅠ 사랑스러워 죽겠네요ㅠㅠ
밑에 비취옥 노 자를 써서 한국식 이름을 지으신 분이 있는데 사실 성명학이라는 게 있어서 보통 비취옥 노 자는 이름에 잘 안 들어가거든요. 그래서 보통 이름에 잘 들어가는 한자를 쓰면 구슬 주(珠) 자에 이슬 노(露)자를 써서 '이슬처럼 맑고 투명한 구슬 같은 아이' 라는 뜻의 주노(珠露)는 어떨까 생각해 봤네요~ 하지만 성으로 이 씨는 추천드리지 않습니다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ출산 축하드려요!!
우와 ㅜㅜ 너무 사람스러워요 ㅠㅠ 세상에 기다릴게요ㅠㅠ

Sooo adorable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
영화 어바웃 타임이 갑자기 생각나네요 ㅋㅋ
서양의 대부대모 문화는 좋은 것 같아요. 후견인 같은 개념으로 부모에게 안좋은일이 생기면 대신  부모 노릇도 해주고 부모와 상의할 수 없는 것들도 상의할 수 있고 제2의 부모이자 친구처럼 지낼 수 있어서 부럽기도 해요. 대부대모도 예비 부모 연습을 할 수도 있어서 학습적으로도 좋구요. 주노~ 아빠를 닮은 것 같기도 하고 엄마를 닮은 것 같기도 한데 건강하고 예쁘게 자라길 바란다. 올리아빠의 반응도 궁금하네요. 첫 손주일까요?^^
애기도 넘 귀여운데 안전상(?) 커플옷 입은 두 남자도 귀여워..ㅋㅋㅋ

주노라는 이름 너무 이뻐요~~ 멀린이 이름 잘 지어줬네요~~ 킹스맨2도 정말 재밌었어요. 아기도 너무 작고 귀엽네요. 이쁘고 건강하게 아무탈 없이 잘 컸으면 좋겠어요!
God bless you 엉엉어유ㅠㅜ 축하해요..ㅠㅠㅠ congratulations...허우유유유ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Ahhh such a beautiful baby Ollie! 올리씨 축하해요 아기가 너무 이쁘네요❤ 항상 재미있는 영상 감사합니다! 앞으로도 한국 많이 사랑해주세요
내가 눈물나냐 . 진짜 아기가 신이야.
해외는 대모 대부 문화가 많으니까 자연스럽고 좋네요
첫 아기인데 아이가 잘 울지 않는거 같아 다행이네요. 아기도 태어날때부터 내성적인 성격과 외향적인 성격으로 나뉘고 자라는 환경에 따라서 성격이 더 강해지거나 줄어들거나 한답니다.  아이가 낮선 사람이 와도 울지 않는거 보니 아주 외향적인 성격인거 같네요. 민감하지 않은 아기니 엄마 아빠가 덜 힘들겠네요. 아주 효녀네요
I am so ready for this.
Oh my God Nicole is just EVERYWHERE! So proud of this woman. Congratulations on your recent strings of success!
Yorgos Lanthimos is a fucking genius filmmaker
A24, you had my curiosity. Now you have my attention.
Aint that the dude in Dunkirk ..?
God damn if it's anything like The Lobster count me in
I think I always say this after every trailer but I love A24!
Colin Farrells beard godamn.
Jesus im so excited for this one!!!
I seriously want to watch this movie, but I'm afraid it's not going to be shown in mainstream cinemas in Germany :(
Hank Hill voice: 'something's not right with that boy, tell you what
YO EVERYBODY\nIf you liked The Lobster, \nWATCH DOGTOOTH
So when do we see some deer action in this film?
In a world of relying on loud noises (IT) and unneeded gore (Mother!), A24 is back again to save the day. This is gonna be B-R-I-L-L-I-A-N-T
I love almost movie you guys have made so far! All original, well done, and entertaining! I'm definitely going to see this one in theaters as well! The only complaint I would have is to not do what you guys did with It Comes At Night for any of your movies ever again. The trailer was misleading and because of that it got trashed on by the casual audience who went to go see it, which is a shame, since it was a really good movie.
I love Yorgos Lanthimos.
Dunkirk 2: George in Heaven is looking really interesting
Wow this looks good, and it's coming out on my birthday
This movie looks weird as Weird Al Yankovic. I love it.
And people say there are no more original films
lol everyone thinking they're cinephiles because they support A24
Excellent
Γιώργο you are a genius !
❤
just a early guess about what happens, the kids father was a patient of colin since hes a surgeon and he let the father die or something so now the kid is coming back for revenge
Nicole Kidman is literally everywhere now
I agree
This looks awesome.
Fucked up.
The guy from Dunkirk❕❗️❕❗️
Absolutely fucking brilliant - that's my kinda review
Young Barry Keoghan is a superb actor.  Loved him in Irish gangland series LOVE/HATE. He has also been in Dunkirk, Trespass Against Us (with Michael Fassbender and Brendan Gleeson) and 71, with Jack O'Connell
Έχουμε καβλώσει!
A24 is best girl
So fucking haunting. Chills.
I am waitingggggggggggggggggg
This looks fucking amazing
Can't wait!
Bless
This looks great
I have no idea what is going on but I'm all in.
not as good as the lobster, but still pretty interesting and creepy at some points. never really scary, but the acting is great and it looks good.
One of the best directors right now.
I still don't know anything about the films plot and I can't wait for it. It looks brilliant
I don't get it.
Love more with hot couple on screen * Nicolin * after watched THE BEGUILED movie
This is the most sinister trailer I have ever seen.
Yes, this one. I wanna see this.
*WE ARE GOING TO WAR GEORGE*
This is going to be so awesome
saw this at TIFF and HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND
The sequel to The Lobster?
I loved that as fucked up as it's looking it's still trying to make you laugh
Oh, look! It's the stairs kid from Dunkirk!
THE SINGING GETS MORE AND MORE CREEPER
can't do less Kubrick-esque
Duuuuuuudee this movies gonna kill it!!!! Love A24
And way to spoil the twist, A24. Good job.
I can’t wait for seeing this’ll movie
Thought he was blind and dead.
GOOSEBUMPS!
How could Barry's name not be mentioned in the end with the rest wtf
Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman were recently in another film together, The Beguiled. It's fantastic, must watch.
That's the little girl from Tomorrowland!
Dad your son is fucking dying...I think he needs some help...He is bleeding from the eyes!!!. Shit
So God Damn tense I love it
DAAAAD, Bob's dying !
Yorgos Lanthimos is already a legend to me
Holy shit the cinematography is so good
please release it in india
yall dick riding A24 like they're the ones making these movies.  Give Yorgos Lanthimos some credit here, A24 is just the distributor
So here we r bcoz its from A24 nd we r loving it..hit like if u agree
Such a weird looking movie but definitely gonna check it out out of curiosity
This does look interesting, but the acting seems a little off for how talented the actors are so I assume it was intentional. It just seems like one of those movies where all your questions and the mystery is revealed in a single scene and you could get most of the story in just a few minutes. Its just about the tension and not knowing.
After that movie it comes at night and a ghost story I'll never watch another movie by this shitty ass production company. Worst movies I've seen in a long time and the acting is laughable
why does a24 only make massive piles of shit?

A Slave and a Slave Master CAN NOT pray to the same God!!!
The white supremacist have always used religion to control black people and we've allowed it to happen since slavery. Always forgiving these white supremacist race soldiers for killing innocent unarmed black people.
I think black people process non-belief differently. Generally, whites become Atheists and want to tell the entire world. Many of them come off as having a real ax to grind with religion. Plenty of black people have turned away from religion. We just don't feel the need to broadcast it like that.
Black and atheist as ever, however I stay gucci down to the socks
Love DL he always says whats on his mind
Proud black, Southern atheist right here!!! Fuck that milk dud headed Steve Harvey because I know my moral barometer is much better than his(whatever the fuck is a moral barometer anyways!!)
*Church is THE gayest place on earth.  I feel sorry for the gays @times.  Imagine me attending a KKKlan rally/backwoods meeting only to hear they don't like my kind for hours on end?  This is how gay folk look in church when Rev. Do-Wrong speaks of them going to hell on a bobsled for being gay.  Then he signals the gay choir director to cue the music.* sad.
Christianity is a religion designed for peasants! I have more respect for (1)Buddhist, (2)Muslims, hell , even(3) Scientologist.  This is why blacks cling on to it. When they fabricated the stories in the book they did it so to control the mass population and  to keep lower class people in check.
I'm a black atheist 😉
When you can sing every word of conjunction junction, but still don't know what one is...that part!
forgiving? \nRuthless. \nWhy does every black person think slavery was like all the slave movies? \nDo people know what a drama is . If slave movies showed the vast reality of it you would be bored off your ass. Plantations were often to mostly remote , rural and life was tedious and mundane. Africans Americans know nothing about the actual brutality of slavery . The real brutality was over in Africa where Muslims (whether black , Arab or Amizigh) castrated slaves. Why does everything that rape was so common and prevelant. That's just an assumption from watching slave dramas. \nWhy do American blax show almost no interest in learning about the real past? Because deep down they don't want to know their real involvement.
Black gay men go to church because that's what black women do.  They take their cues from black female behavior.  They mimic them completely.  Church attendance in the black community is cultural and traditional.  It's not about God or being a good Christian.  It's about following that cultural imperative, because your mama and grandma forced you to go and they called out Jesus name in vain all the time.  The black church is a cesspool of sin.  There is no God there.
There's plenty of evidence: go to evidenceunseen.com and actually investigate and read a book vlad.  You can tell your not studied our country is becoming post modern not atheist anymore.  If you are an atheist you have no objective standard of morality, you have no objective purpose, there is no point of even living if there is nothing after this because you can't take it with you.  You have the burden of proof.
I don't Agree with this Fool at all but He's Dead On...Churches be Gay asf 💯😂
Please...don't....mention Jesus's name....you're an athiest right? And dont mock Christianity...as for what I said about you choking or gasping for air....believe me...you would no longer be an atheist...NOW....dont bother responding moron.
This Russian bitch stop dropping parts and just drop entire video
So a suicide bomber is spiritually fine? A pedophilic priest is spiritually fine? Black people spend $14 mil a week at church, but hardly support each other or invest in our community infrastructure. That $14 mil would be a great start towards being financially fine as you put it. My comment came as harsh, but I truly don't care about or hate any religion, I just see it as a hindrance for progress and a waste of my time.
I'm bout to start going to church again, find me a black woman.
D.L. actually has a point, cause the black Church well not Church, but the crazy lunatics inside the Church hates LGBT ppl, but they're always the ones whose LGBT, but on the DL...what D.L. said about the Boosie thing is what I've been saying for the longest is that nothing can turn you gay or make you gay, cause you're gay if you find the same gender attractive, so how can seeing gay ppl on TV automatically make you attracted to the same gender? that means you already had thoughts like that, but scared to express it and also when you're uncomfortable with LGBT ppl then you turn to children trying to use that as bait and blame blame blame...on the restroom thing I just think that women whether cis or trans should be in the woman's restroom period, cause what if you put Jazz Jennings a 16 year old in the men's restroom? what about her safety? cause there's numbers of assaults done to trans women and not one evidence showing that trans women use the restroom for nefarious purpose, but ppl are uncomfortable, so they bait you talking about what about the children? well guess what dummies, a predator doesn't need a law to stop them from hurting kids you morons.
I'm tatted up, but his tattoos doesn't fit him
He sounds stupid as hell.  I see why I don't even entertain his shows.  Go do something with your life becasue your wisdom and been a comedian is not working for you.  How his men in the church are gay.  You may have 1 out of 100 but you saying it as if all men in church is gay.  My choir director is not gay.
Correction Mr Hughley. You need Jesus, Comic View. As a 'Joy' man, a homospiritual, gayness is a sexually oriented counterfeit of my spiritual relationship with an invisible man called Jesus. He makes my joy complete. Ever since I started listening to Jesus every other dude started looking like a ladyboy. You too, Jamar. Just ask Yeezus. My wife would prefer it if I slept in the bed with Jesus inside me. I don't expect anyone to understand what it is to be 'joy'. Joy rights have been replaced gay rights, the spiritual with sex. I'm staying in love with my man Jesus, Jamaicans know this is right. I'm just in love with the perfect man. It saves me watching anybody else, whooo! Joy pride...looks like a fool on a cross until you wake up into reality.
What is up with all those tattoos on his neck...SMH\nDude is over 50 with all that mess on him.
If u dont believe in God then Who created the earth ur standing on? Who created Adam and Eve? How would u know that a woman was made for a man? How would u know that homosexuality is wrong? Plz dont say science . Majority of these so called christians u see today are fake christians so people give up on faith becuz of how christianity is being portrayed. Anybody can go to church and claim they're a Christian, but are they truly living the Word of God? If I go to a church and all I see is homosexual ppl in the pulpit and the pastor isnt preaching the word of God or is teaching prosperity, i know thats wrong becuz thats NOT christianity. Im not gonna jst say well God isnt real and give up on my faith based off other peoples sinful acts. That should have nothing to do with ur walk with God. All u can do is pray for them.
D.L is not lying about that.  All jokes aside 💯💯💯💯
Vlad : Kaityln Jenner was ESPN's woman of the year!\nDL : Yeah & she wasn't a woman for a month!
Bra DL old ass TATTED THE FUCK UP THO !!! I nigga got mo hits then lil wayne
The Truth will either set you free or scare the shit out you God is a women not the one n that fake as Bible with fake ass jesus
TOXIC COMMENT SECTION BELOW: GRAB SOME POCORN AND SOME ORANGE MILK SIT BACK AND ENJOY THE SHOW!
A  black man on his knees in a church with a white jesus image in his mind you got to be GAY. Along with that type of posture and that image NO way you can be a positive image other young black men absolutely 👎 NO way.
That have to conflict your mind a lot on top of all the other issues that they face
Man, i LOVE this hat DL. Very stylish sir. Man, it's banging!!!!!!!
You wanna solve the bathroom issue....write dick on one door and vagina on the other...boom
This guy acts woke but he really isnt. He is also indoctrinated by white society. IMO.
The last minute of the video, he's right. Like no you want people to know. That example goes along with so many other things
It was given to us by the white man to keep us down! They hid the truth and our history from us please READ and RESEARCH
Boozie saying their trying to make ppl gay but he said when he was locked up he seen 2 niqqers fucking each other... So I guess black dudes don't need no help?!
He said it doesn't make sense lol
I like D.L., but I think there is something to what Boosie said.  I've seen things and been a victim of things that give me an understanding of how people can try to intrude on the most personal and basic attributes of human existence.  And the big orgs that he's talking about are made up of people.  As a writer, I often write about character's private lives and a few of those characters in every would I have created have been homosexual.  I'm not trying to change the sexuality of others, I'm just creating worlds that look like the world I've experienced.  But others aren't like me.  If they can use storytelling power to rule over others, they will.
I used to believe in God.. until my grandmother, a woman who has served the Lord for the majority of her life, spent most of her time serving the church, has always paid her ties....ends up with Alzheimer dementia...God is allowing her to lose her mind, despite her faithfulness. My family seems to believe that she can just speak the disease away by quoting scriptures, esp my aunt who is in denial... and it really enrages me. IDK what to believe... im leaning/moving more towards Deism to be honest.\n\nMy aunt is in denial, willfully ignorant about my grandmother's condition... and as a result, she is doing things that she is not supposed to do when dealing with an elderly person that has this condition, she doesn't understand that my grandmothers mind rubberbands and that the disease causes habits that are innate ... so it is pointless to attempt to constantly correct or remind my grandmother.. I got so angry at her a couple weeks ago about a situation between both of them that  i wanted to lay hands on her.... but that would be unacceptable.
Never mistake the Christian church for being connected with the bible,its not!!!\nThey hold the bible in their hand but blaspeme and don't follow it or teach it at all!!!!
2:00-06 he just said the shit Vlad
I believe in the higher power but not da bullshit
Also I said to my friend the other day it's really no longer a man's world it's a women and children's World hence there's more gays in the world which I have no problem with it but it's true there's more homosexuals in the world today than there ever has been a lot of people like to blame it on the men not being in the home but again these men are being raised mostly by women
DL looks like a state trooper with that hat on
Majority of these churches are full of undercover devils. Those preachers will preach the word but will do the exact opposite. The ones preaching sanctimoniously be the ones with the most dirt like that dude on the Spike Lee movie Red Hook Summer.
What is the deal with the black community always finding this shit to discuss? Somebody always being suspect or looking a certain way, its not gonna matter whos gay or straight, its not gonna stop nobody's money flow or how this economy is ran, why is this the only community that has such a stigma with this? Ya'll don't like talking about it then turn around and bash your very own brothers and sisters of color that are. This is why blacks will never be able to come together as one
YOOHOO....OVER HERE DL!!! I'm black and I am an atheist!!!! And I know a few more! We are DEFINITELY out here, lol!!!
I don't believe in God. I think religion is used for mind control. I'm not knocking anybody for believing, as long as you practice what you preach. If not, keep it movin'
Gays flock to the church because they feel safe because they know the church HAS to accept everyone.  It's their safe place.
ATL niggas be like it's only gay if you suck dick and you like
im just here to see what the DoDo chasers are going to say !
He dont have any eyebrows...dl need to do some research on cartoon tho i mean the gayest shit ever..
black people dont like gay people? ..fake news
Shout out to Eddie Long!
Psalm 14:1 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good... The fool (one who is morally perverse, not mentally deficient) is described as to his belief (no God) and behavior (none... good). His is a practical rather than a theoretical atheism. vv.2-7. Psalm 10:4; Psalm 53:1; Genesis 6:11-13; Romans 3:10. Be Bless.
It's so many niggas on the down low in church
Vaccines changes the dna of the children,  so u add that with gmo products,  bad water, and gay images. We are in a war.
I bet there are plenty of people who go to church every Sunday, sit in the pews, and have a struggle in their heart and mind about whether God truly exists. They go out of routine and from fear of rejection and disownment from family, partners and friends. At least 90% of blacks are religious and are ready to cut your throat if you say you don't believe God exists. So some people keep quiet and just do the routine.
hell is a mythology about Earth, so u might as well let that fear go, G and hit the books. Salute to the OG DL tho on God/Allah/Buddha and Big Mama.
DL? More like Double D L! Look at those fucked up titties of his!
D.L. is correct look at side effects of soybean food, vaccines, dental mercury amalgam and black preacher etc it's crazy man very crazy the world we live in
I didn't know this brother was so deep
dl..if it's supposed to be a girl, but she's just a guy Cross dressing!? then he rapes your daughter? his point is correct. but that's not OUR, people against it, point..
I KNOW God exists. But that's not for me to prove. Either your spirit knows or you're just lost in the human experience. Such is life, literally. But if you fear going to hell that's not true belief anyway. May as well be athiest.
And DL just LOVES Church.

DL face when Vlad said gay cartoons 😂😂😂
Y'all wannabe atheist nigga goofy 😆😆
Dislike squadddd all day culture vulture
society...meaning white people.
This guy is weird looking now lol
In slavery the church was the only place you could come together and have some relief , it was like the only social gathering available almost like a concert  , you was not allowed in night clubs , theatres and etc. Thats why it became a big deal with the culture .
The black church is definitely beyond suspect of gay shit
We should not be so forgiving
No shit! A Jew obsessed with black culture is essentially an atheist... I've never seen one of those before
What's up with dude vlad a black people. He need to talk to some real niggas
Just read Deuteronomy 28 the whole chapter an Deuteronomy 7, an Psalms 83. It will tell you who the true hebrew an jews are. An why black people go through so much
African spirituality is full of forgiving people also before, and after Christian influence.
Boosie said evil coming at the kids with gay agenda through cartoons D L refutes it and then turns around to strengthen it with his bathroom logic saying they're trying to push something on us we don't agree with by unnecessarily bringing it up, whether cartoons parades bathroom disputes or coming out the closest it's to desensitize and normalize abnormalities
Davey & Goliath was a Lutheran show. Shame on you D.L.
DL so you just gonna let a atheist shame your people bcz they practice the virtue of forgiveness . Shame on you DL for not knowing the value of human value of true love . Forgiveness is not a sign of weakness it’s a gift that brings abundance of great energy . It takes a real man / Women to forgive . Let’s not forget that .
That forgiveness trait comes from slavery!
Forgive lol why?
Atheism >>>>>

Reverse Psychology 101: First Create a Religion. Then claim that the Religion comes from certain books (Bible). Then hire many who hate and despise the books (Bible) & Yah to proclaim a ton of lies about the books and many customs. \nAnd people who dont read, will hate the persons (Yahweh & Yisrael) in the book, the book itself (Bible) and the religions they think come from the books (bible)\n\nYea, yall fell for the okie doke. 99.999% of people who hate Yah/Bible dont hate it because of what they read, but they hate it from he say/she say of religions and religious people, and the things religious people do.
I'M A BLACK CHRISTIAN.
haha to all my school books....
Only another 3000 odd, that doesn't sound like that many! Definitely need to choose books wisely then!
You just get more and more amazing.
This was lovely Sanne! Also makes me feel a lot better hearing of others who neglected some university reading 😂
We are doing Sherlock in 8th grade ( 9th year)
I absolutely adored this! I am also so heartbroken at how few books I have left to read.
That was really sad! Beautiful, but sad.
This is so different from your usual videos but I absolutely love the different feel!\nAnd I can totally relate still. There are simply books we'll never read, for one reason or another.\nBut it's okay.
Beautiful and I'm now depressed about how few books I still have time to read...
I loved this! Great video!
THIS WAS SO GOOD!!! I'm in awe
I love this sooo much 💜
Where are the pillows around the 1 min mark from ? Love the print!
can i have the books that make me look impressive tho
You are beautiful, this is beautiful.
ONLY 3550??????? a;ldkfjaoisdjfakjbglajfldajs?!?!?!?! woah. That absolutely blew my mind. I need to reevaluate my life O_O
This was so beautiful ❤
Aww this is so cute 💕 absolutely love it!
That was like a love note to all books 😍☺️
So true! love this :)
Yes!!! I love this! Warmed my heart <3
This is such a wonderful video! Love the atmosphere ❤️
This is amazing. I love this so much! ❤️❤️❤️ I couldn’t agree more for this.
I absolutely loved this, well done!
This is so beautiful❤️
This is a very cute video, and something I can relate to as well. I loved the stop motion animation. Very nice job!
This so beautiful video!
Beautiful. But I got kind of freaked out by the book count. So many books, only one lifetime 😯
Beautifully made and very touching 💝
What a beautiful video!
This is so beautiful!
Such a beautiful video! I’m obsessed with the doodles 😍
Okay, this goes to one of my favourite youtube videos ever. LOVED IT.
I love the way you edited this video!!
This is so beautifully made. Thank you 😊 \nMay I ask what music you used in the background?
Such a wonderful video!
this is so lovely! 💛
Amazing video!!!! It's very different from what you usually do, I love it!
this is so cute!
Thank you for making this. Love it!
It hurts how clod your words are towards those books. If I've ever decided to do a video like this, I'd be crying because of how sorry I am.
Love this so much <3
This is so cute! Love it!
Sanne I have CHILLS. Also I can't bear the thought of how few books I'll get to read in my lifetime, I am reading as fast as I can!!
Such a beautiful video, I'm very moved and I don't even know why!
This is so great Sanne 💖
This is a beautiful video !
Sanne, this is soo beautiful! \nI can relate so much lol, although I don’t like giving up on books, they just wander back onto my to-read pile, in the hopes that I’ll eventually come back to them. Especially uni books. I doubt I ever will though. There’s way too many wonderful stories out there that are just waiting for me. :)
This puts me in the right mood for a reading weekend!
this is so beautiful :)
Wow Sanne that video is so great, I'm in love 😍😍
i LOVE this idea
Glad it wasn't just me who didn't read books that were part of a school/college/university course, I was supposed to read Great Expectations for my English Language and Literature A-Level, I never did, I didn't like it, not helped by the fact that it was a crumbling old copy last borrowed from school in 1974 (I started my A-Levels in 1999).
Omg why did this make me tear up?! The feeeeeeeeeels !!!! 😢
This made me emotional and idk why? Like I feel like I could cry. That was beautiful
I had a tear???? This was beautifullllllll! 💝
Wow!
So so beautiful <3
Fantastic! Loved this :)
This is amazing.

This is so lovely, Sanne!
Wow this was amazing!
this video is insanly beautiful and definately&totally warmed my heart😊 meer van dit soort videos graaaaggg
fuck the literary canon created by old, white, straight men. i'd rather be at a party discussing some queer poc authors or something than a book by obe everyone pretends to have read because some senile people think we have to.
This is brilliant😁 ILOVEILOVEILOVE❤❤❤
this is beautiful! you should be very proud of it.
Lovely video, Sanne! As I get older I think about this more and try to both read more and not waste time on things I don't really enjoy. I have to add, though, that you should give Middlemarch a chance - it's absolutely full of interesting characters and a world you can absolutely get lost in!
Yes, I was trolling British cider lovers. Sorry.
I fucking love your voice jfc
Looks ultra-yum! I also admire that freakishly small ladle.
Freakishly small ladle
This was so good.   What a perfect dinner for October 1st.  I did it over the spaetzle instead though.   Cooking time was about 2.5 hours.
My first try at this is in the first hour simmer and you never said how the whole house is filled with such a wonderful the aroma.
Could I substitute beef with this easily? Where's the fat content on the shoulder highly important
Just finished cooking this and it's a really great recipe. I reduced my sauce down a lot, to the point where it was basically a gravy. You get a great balance of sweetness from the cider and earthy savoriness from all the sage. And that little bit of vinegar not only reigns in the sweet cider but the acidity helps marinate the pork. I paired it with some butternut squash I roasted in dill and pepper. Thanks Chef John!
Can you make Belgian carbonade ?
From a butcher; that is a pork butt. The shoulder is the next section down. Yes, they are virtually interchangeable. However, they are in fact two different sub-primals, and if you're going to the length of getting friendly with a local butcher, it's worth note.
Give it the oooolllldd poka poka lol
I made this yesterday, turned out so delicious. Did have to go for standard apple cider, didnt find sage leaves in 3 supermarkets (not even dried) So I went for a bit of a mix of thyme and rosemary. Which didn't give the same flavour but they sure did the trick for making it just as delicious. Have to keep my eye out for some fresh sage so I can make this properly, might even have to grow my own sage for the sake of trying it!
Made this tonight. Wonderful and so so easy to make
I tried this. It was delicious. I added pig trotters to it so it was rich and so good.
nope... sorry... cant watch this right now. im not ready to be hungry yet... im saving this for breakfast lol
I make pork in cider with apples every fall. The gravy is brown, savory and spicy. Cider goes into my squash soup too. Cider is under utilized in cooking,
a la pork latte with a vinegar kicker....  \nThis was DELISH! The smell reminded me if my Grandmother's chitterlings but taste better.
my food wish is a savoury puff pastry appetizer. I keep making your sausage rolls for my guy, as he LOVES them. Unfortunately I have never been a huge fan of sausage rolls,  so I would love a little puff pastry appetizer I could make at the same time for myself!
I'm onto you chef John. I saw that America's test kitchen episode a few days ago.
The old poke-a poke-a
Chef John: What brand of French hard cider do you use. Is Calvados appropriate? I intend to make this recipe soon.
Can one use some of the amazing stock of the pork and cider as a stock for risotto?
Wow.
My mouth watered ugh 😑 I want some !
SPIDERMAN IS HUNGRY ! SPIDER MAN HA HA HA HA HA

I'm sick to death of these dammed 'Prescription Drug Commercials! I thought there was a law against advertising Prescription Drugs drugs online! All I want to do is watch these videos without all the BS!
Wow
Hi ☺️, could you do a video making mulligatawny soup sometime? Thanks!
Omg, that sounds foodgasmic!
Looks amazing!!!!
El chema de nega
you is you 💛
Interesting take on Somerset Pork.
Delicata squash? Yes,please!
Kosher salt on pork...
Buttered rice you say?
That looks soooo good.
YOU ARE TRENDING :)
#25 trending thats what i wanna see
always love ur recipe this 1 looks outrageously YUM! Thank chef John.
Yoooo, Chef John is trending
Making this!! 😋😋
omg
Looks like you stole this idea from another YouTube Channel
Chef, at about 6:11 you showed a close up of the simmering gravy. The sides of the dutch oven had fond on them. Why didn't you scrape it down and dissolve it into the simmering liquid?
First time the cayenne came in so late
This is my new place to come to when I miss my dad reading me bed time poems.
John,  I shouldn't watch your videos at 1 in the morning.  I'm now gonna go cook.
Would this work with beef for those who can't eat pork?
Stole my recipe except that I always leave it bone on.  You just can't replicate the feel and taste of collagen.  Way better than resorting to flour or corn starch to thicken the sauce.  I also add thick apple slices to the braise so when done you have a more less savory apple sauce
John have you tried traditional English cider? Flat, strong, dry, tasting 100% of apples, tart, etc? I really think youd like it (maybe in recipes like this, or to drink...)
Takes sooo long to cook. I cooked it in a pressure cooker and took half an hour only.
we're not trying to make pulled pork here\nBut could we make pulled pork with a similar method?\npossibly thickening the sauce so it sticks more to the meat?
My heart never beats like it beats at this
I would love to see the squash recipe as well.
Ok, going on next grocery list.  Can't wait to drink the sauce!\n\nJust had the billionaire frank and beans, never been a fan but Chef John's recipe is simple, quick and absolutely gonna be an added favorite to my house (I cheated in one spot and didn't use water, I used veg broth ; ) watch the vidy and you'll understand.
Omg.....this is a alllllllllll day to cook 🍖 meat. Thanksgiving turkey 🦃 doesn't even take this long.! I'm going to give it a try though.
I have that exact same pot but can't brown anything in it! How do you brown meat on ceramic?
The rhythm of how you speak is very entertaining! :)
Wow not hours before I watched this video I bought a delicatta squash! Please show me what to do with it :)
Hi Chef John, is this recipe going up on All Recipes?
Sounds yummy. I’m making it this weekend.  Please do the squash video, too. It is squash season, after all.
You are the boss of your pork shoulder stewed in a creamy apple cider sauce!  Yes!  Want to learn more about Delicata squash for sure.  At first I thought it could have been sautéed apples which, of course, would have paired nicely with the pork shoulder.   Regardless Chef more on Delicata and other winter squash types.  Very underrated vegetable.
This man is bordering on national treasure
I could of used this recipe about 4 days ago when I found a 5LB pork shoulder for $7.00 . The only recipes I could find was bbq pulled pork.
My food wish is a open cheese pie\nhttps://i.pinimg.com/originals/55/d5/ea/55d5eac2d9f69dd00e390535d6958ff5.jpg
Congrats on being #20 on the trending list! Good for you.
the cadence of this dude's voice bothers me
Did recipe with beef shoulder instead...worked great!
Pork shoulder is one of my favorite cuts from pork besides pork ribs and belly. Usually pork loins are too lean to my taste unless I make it sous vide.
Everything is better with a touch of Cayenne.
Cider from France??? Live local,buy local,love local,,,support our own.

I would like to try this with lamb.
I think I will add a star anise and a cinnamon stick.
what does hard cider mean? how is it different from regular cider? (a non-native english speaker here)
Wooo 25 on trending!! 😁😁😁
i reduce my sauce/gravy in a vacuum evaporator.. so much better
listen to me now and hear me later....lol
Chef John, Amid the chaos, corruption and scandal that peppers the news on a daily basis, your humour and good nature provide the perfect antidote! Please keep up the great work!
Just made it. With a twist I reduced with a bit of the best home made beef stock, no salt added, and put just a few flakes of teragon. Wow amazing.
bouncin on my boy's d to this
All I saw in the title was PORK CREAMY SAUCE
I've been watching Food Wishes for years! Do you know how much I support and love the channel? I don't even skip the ads so you can get that revenue. Stay hustling Johnny boy.
His voice makes me sooooo sleepy \n😴😴\nI'm not complaining or anything
Hello Chef John. I just made this and the pork was delicious, but the gravy is too tangy/vinger-y. Did I not reduce it enough? I reduced the liquid low and even added about 2 teaspoons of sugar because the sauce was very vinegar-y.
Why does he sound like he is singing?
Good god his tone of voice is so crazy its like hes excited about every single sentence that comes out of his mouth oh my god!
where is the beef, I mean MEAT!!!!!! I'm not much on boiled fat.
Now give it the old poka poka  i will forever use this😂😂😂
i dont know enough about being jewish, but is there a thing with kosher salt on pork, is that halal or whatever ok forget it.
chef john - i really must ask you this: do you have some religious objection to pressure cookers??  while this may not be the best example, but there are plenty where you could have used one and (imho) think you could have gotten better results, far faster.  you NEVER use pressure cookers.  what's up with that?\n\nanyone else with me on this?
I am sure others commented on @  4:14  the sauce went from a liquid to a thicker more reduced sauce. Plus pan had more meat in after the edit.  Chef John I am rather disappointed in this presentation.
the brown stuff at the bottom of the pan is actually called the suuc. the fond is when you deglaze it with liquid.
What did you say the glaze at the bottom of the pan is called ?
his voice goes up and down again and again
So, pay Amazon to watch you have sex?
How is the speaker is it better then the echo dot?
Great job CIA 😀👌🙌🎆🎉🔥
Amazon wants camera and mic in every room of the house
Typo at 0:48
Great now the NSA can see me sleeping !!
fresh whose release another clean suspect living AM.
Amazon is so clever with their promoting. It's about time someone updated the alarm clock. A 'smart clock' is a far easier sell than a talking speaker that stalks you
free video calls to amazon corporate headquarters and the NSA.  just press nothing.
You all are a bit paranoid about big brother. I'll be getting one. I like the idea of having a interactive and smart alarm clock and this one looks aesthetically beautiful
Now they can see me while having sex
The Amazon Echo looks like a rip-off of the Bonjour Alarm Clock...\n\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1450781303/bonjour-smart-alarm-clock-with-artificial-intellig
they should kill the bezels
the goal of modern living is simplicity, not more gadgets
Its going to look so hot with s big piece of black tape on the camera. I'll sit it right next to the fan I have with matching black tape on the blue light that shoots out of it.
Yea if i buy one, the first thing i will do is put a tape on the front facing cam. \n\nIt would be nice if companies would think about actually making some kinda lid on the camps their integrate into their products, \nso people would have a choice, so people dont have to destroy the design of the thing with a ugly table. \n\nBuy hey, first world problems..
Amazon need to stop stealing others ideas, like this one:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufR8uJAAw0&t=
Yay an alarm clock that uses electricity!! That's a game changer!
what a load of rubbish
I will not put that magic 8 ball w/ a camera in my bedroom. \n\nAlso I wonder how many ppl do video calls. Anecdotally idk anyone. Curious if the rest of population does regularly enough to buy this. They must if Amazon if Amazon is betting on it
This is almost what I wanted... but for something to really be an alarm clock it needs to have a backup battery.  I used my dot as an alarm clock for awhile, but the first time the power went out and my alarm didn't go off, I had to stop using it.
That THING looks like a color iMac! Amazon devices are REALLY FAT-Show, Spot, Tablets EVERYTHING.\n\nThat's why they only show front views of the Show.
Amazon wants a bunch of these in homes. The price needs to be $50 less then.
So 100 dollars less than a spot?
I want one. But can't even pre-order it in the UK. Probably won't get it until Spring.
Would be nice if it had a phsical camera cover
Is amazon going to offer some kind if trade in upgrade for people with old alexas
I'm distracted by his tiny head.
I have a phone.
Not to be confused with the nVidia Spot, which is scheduled to come out.... someday, they think.\nhttps://www.nvidia.com/en-us/shield/smart-home/
Cool device with an attractive pitch and design, but Amazon's ecosystem doesn't appeal to me at all, and it's not available in all countries.
I would buy that for a dollar
love it. need to get it. available yet?
i thought we developed smartphones in order to get rid of alarm clocks...
Why would anyone want that wire tap in their house?
Okay, of all of the echo products so far, this one (to me at least) looks the most futuristic of the bunch. I don't even use Alexa or any smart home appliances for that matter, but I want it anyway
one in the kitchen, bedroom, and living room? yeah no thanks. and you know why...
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01J94SWWU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01J94SWWU&linkCode=as2&tag=amazondail08c-20&linkId=92ce149f5173f11411a09f0161801b5d
Looks cool but always listening is becoming always watching...
Looks nice but Alexa can’t answer some very basic questions. Would love to see this hardware with google assistant intelligence.
0:48 indeed, a good clcol amazon echo spot is
The dot next to my computer keeps waking up to this
So pretty much a device that does everything my smartphone already does.  I think I'll pass.
Probably most appealing thing in the line-up more affordable price, small modern form-factor, and it has the luxury of a screen + all the features of a regular echo.
FREE video calls?!? No freaking way!
don't put that in bedroom
Imagine Alexa in your bedroom listening to you sleep...
This is my favorite eco but I’m not buying it since amazon have information to the government about people talking to the eco
Not sure about having a camera next to my head while I'm sleeping.  Believe it or not, I obviously LOVE tech....emmm emm my tech review channel :).  However, when it's time to sleep I want absolutely NO TECH in my bedroom, including my phone.
Does youtube work on it?
WALLS HAVE EARS! AND YOU'RE PAYING FOR IT!
I wonder why they didn't make the screen bigger. Should have went with a 3 screen
Wow now that's cool
new product from CI... i mean amazon 😊
I think this is the most interesting of the new devices but it's real potential is lost to me when it doesn't keep a charge for like lets say the power goes out...    Then it's not a dependable alarm clock.
Who wonna trade vid clips on this 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Any idea if the display can turn off?  Asking for the clock in a bedroom use case.
Has anyone ever told Alexa to shut up
Coming Soon: Amazon Cool Beans- an alexa enabled refrigerator, specifically designed for beans. starts at 1299
Why would you want a camera on it?
My Echo kept going off during this video lmao
Doesn't this one look too similar with the upcoming smart speaker by the essential?
too pricey, $75 per an we got a deal
It's a buy and a great deal.. can't wait for the knock off version
This looks cool but has personal data breach written all over it. -no thanks.
So it does nothing my phone can't do.
Put one in your bedroom huh? then don't forget to cover the camera or turn it around whenever you're pleasuring yourself, cause you just never know who's watching.........
South Park should had waited to make that Alexa episode how funny whould this be if they mocked the fact that this thing has a camera on it
one in the bathroom?
These devices are great epitomes of consumerism.
Jeof Bezzoz is lost
150$ ??!! No thanks
How come Amazon sucks at making products.
Bedroom
Makes me miss my Chumby.
Should have included wireless charging
meh.
たけー
Nest Alarm Clock
Gayy
Its pretty elegant
A smart alarm clock? Nice.
Make Alexa Great Again #MAGA
STOP saying ALEXA! lol
Djmario sube el CAMINO!!
Nexus Q, anybody?
I want it
Wait until edward snowden see this..
putting an internet connected smart device with a good front facing camera in your bedroom? Grrreeaat idea!
Just as a word of advice to some of the people commenting, here's a hint: ANYTHING with a camera or a microphone connected to the internet can be used by the government to watch you. Your phone, any microphones you have connected to your computer, webcams, all of that can be used to watch you. So, can the government watch you through this? Yes. Of course they can, and I'm sure they probably will. But they can also watch you at all times when you're on your phone or your laptop watching this video. It isn't new information, people. Yes, these devices can be used to watch you, but anything connected to the internet with some kind of recording device can be used to do that. The only difference is that this is a smart alarm clock. Doesn't matter.
Is there anyway that if you had one in your kitchen, in your living room, on your desk, and in your bedroom that you can link them and use them as home surveillance?
To all who are commenting that this echo spot will now be able to hear you and see you in your bedroom. Hope you morons realize you carry your phones everywhere.
Got Siri, I don’t need this weird spyware thing too.
But does it have an aux out port. If it does I'd totally get one.
I'd pay $20 for this glorified photoframe.
this is pretty cheap so idk why people are complaining
What usefully those devices do? Other than stealing your data.
this is great, because before taking or making calls i always run to the bedroom and lie down first.
130 is way too expensive
The issue with this is that an alarm clock needs 100% reliability. What if there is no power or WiFi. Does it have back up power and does the clock work fully with no internet. Does it go down sometimes.  On a regular Echo none of this matters, but it does on an alarm clock. That has to work every single time, with no exceptions ever.

Place is cold dude decide to paint the house blue
But I like stupid YouTube's.
Toronto lol.  Come on man Americans aren't that stupid.  Most would probably say Anchorage or something in Alaska.
DO a video on New Hampshire’s “Northern Pass” its a pretty short topic so it will fit with this channel and I think you will like it! Plz like this so he can see!
thumbs down for the pushing of storyblocks. oh an a shit, uniformative video
Came here for the video, but fell in love with Tromsø.
I was really hoping you'd add Ittoqqortoormiit Greenland to the list.  Mostly because I really wanted to hear you try to pronounce Ittoqqortoormiit.
great vid\nkeep it up👍
I loved the Toronto joke
Wow ads built into the video. Fuck that
cheeky transition to the sponsor in the end. I like it.
Most northern town showdown;\n\nAmerica: Looks like shit\nRussia: looks like shit\nNorway: Looks pretty decent
I really thought it would be Eureka
Half As Intresting \nHalf As Awesome!\n\n\n\n\n\nI think thats a compliment.....
Good luck tho the Norwegian post service is slow even on the mainland
Norway squad, where ya at?
You know you live in Ny-Ålesund when you cheat on your wife and the whole town finds out about it
I'd say do the southern most town, but I imagine everyone's parents are brother and sister, and the place would be rampant with mental disability.
Love it that you roast everyone – even Newark 😂😂😂
Fascinating video. Thank you for all of your hard work in making it!
I have a friend from Svalbard, hes fuckin' weird.
Can you please make more videos every week
Whats the northernmost town? How depressed are they? Why havent they moved? And why am i still commenting!?
Hey, Long-Years-byen right?\n(Long year it's been)
I found one flight reference. I'm at peace now.
So Svalbard might not require a visa but in order to get there - I'm assuming you will need a transit visa via a third country to get there depending on your passport.
Omg my grandad did his military service in Murmansk in soviet times
You should have used a globe instead of a projection for this one
grise fiord, nunavut is the most northern town
Tromsø\nPronounced (bear with me, that ø is a vowel that doesn't occur in English) trohm-say (-ay has rounded lips)\nÅlesund\nPronounced Uh-lay-soond
I like that word stupid youtuber
Is there any internet there on that island?
Why would a Brit say that Edinburgh's the most northern town in the world? it's not even the most northern town in the UK.  I'm currently in Loch Ness, which is situated in Inverness, a whole city further north than Edinburgh.
As a Canadian, i'm actually happy that you put up a picture of two tents in Alert and called it our northern most military settlement. Our military is useless.
Your transitions into the ad part are getting more creative...
I'm Norwegian and the way he pronounces the cities is hilarious😂
I live in Toronto, anyone else?
This video is stolen
Toronto the northernmost? I hope this was just a joke and no one believes that, the US has entire states north of Toronto (Washington, Montana and North Dakota).
i get rly annoyed by the way he pronounces tromsø
You're more sarcastic than informative
Why would a Brit say Edinburgh?
Does it have Internet
After seeing this video, I was really excited with story blocks free trial and went for it and from the impression I got in the video I would be able to download many clips over the next 7 days and try out this amazing platform, but just after downloading a half a dozen clips or so I got a message saying I have exceeded the limit of video I could download during the trail, this limit wasn't explicit in your video or after clicking the link. I would like to know if anything can be done about this and if I could continue downloading stock footage
It's not too-lay\n\nit's a th sound like when you say through then ool like tool
I’ve been to Ny-Ålesund
Only British people aren't retarded enough to think Edinburgh is the northernmost town.
You can just decided to move to Svalbard. You are required to have a job  if you wanna live there and you need a permanent address somewhere else. When you retire you have to move.
Not only did he call Edinburgh a town he didnt realise that there is civilization above it seriously?
How about what is the southernmost Town in the world?
The transition to that sponsorship was not boring at all. That's pure marketing.
Already trending on this channel..Big things are to come
Thank you for the video! Ive always wondered whats going on the northernmost part of the world..
because logic and sensibility does not exist in Russia...\n\nhuh. it'll be The Northenmost World in Town
I wanna move to svalbard.
If you ask an American, the northernmost town in the world is probably Toronto, Canada.\n\n\n\nLmfao
The humour is great, and that segway into the ad was flawless
I live in Longyearbyen !!
To my bucket list
I really do not think anyone in the UK thinks Edinburgh is the northern most town. Its not even a town. I live further a lot north than Edinburgh.
1:43 gives me a cool fact:\n\nLongyearbyen saw totality in the 2015 total eclipse on March 20, but the same year the town suffered an avalanche.
Half as interesting is the mean cousin of wendover productions.
1:12 How the f**k is Murmansk a city with 300000 people a town

Hallo fra tromsø (hello from tromsø)
4:19 *cough* jakepaul *cough* sign me up!
You CAN live in Alert as it's a city
the most northernmost town is actually Alert,Canada
The way he says Tromsø is funny
My mom used to live an hour away from Murmansk!
Barrow AK ?
Just call it Long Year City, that's what it means
As a Norwegian, I learn more about my country from foreign youtubers than from school

Chomp

Seltzer water tastes like pennies.
Yaaaay!
Chomp. 😊
Chomp :)
Gains :P
Chomp x
Please share your burrito recipe and homemade pizza too. Thanks ;)
My favorite thing about this, is that you don't completely cut all the junk out. You don't regularly consume it, but you do indulge
Realist week ever, but still super impressed!
I love your videos!  I also have two little boys :) and drink fizzy water all day long, it's the best!  It feels like a treat and keeps me hydrated.
I lost 10 lbs just from listening to this lol 😂
Still waiting for emmy to hit 1M subscribers Hi
I drink lots of water, too.  I drink at least a half gallon a day.
My brain (to stomach): Yah see? This is why we can't get up the stairs fast enough!!!!
The secret of her beauty
u motivate me to eat, I haven't enjoyed eating in the past few days
Having a preschooler and a school age child does keep a Mom very busy
Emmy pls pls pls make a video on your Pad See Ew. 😍😍
where did you get the narutomaki?
I love your name!
THAT UDON LOOKS SO GOOD, I'VE BEEN CRAVING SOME, PLEASE TELL US  HOW TO MAKE IT
What are those pink things in the noodle dish
Emmy! Look at these crazy retro recipes! \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolRidiculous/comments/68bsg0/my_day_is_never_too_busy_to_eat_this/  and  http://i.imgur.com/IhExOzx.png\n\nYou have to make them!
I wonder if the seltzer water might be the culprit behind all the burp outtakes :D
Emmy, you should get a Soda Stream. Love my fizzy water, and your boys will love the fart noises the machine makes!
No offense but....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAin't nobody got time for that
I have been waiting so long for another one of these! 😮😄😍
You know when you watch Emmy's videos the hunger strikes
You should have an EmmyMade recipe and meal plans book!
First of all I adore you. You are probably my fave on YouTube, have you tried the POLAR or GOYA brand of flavor seltzer water  it's really good not too strongly flaverd more like an aroma. I'm a pepsi drinker trying to you know kick the habit and it's working.
I thought the bowl in the thumbnail was a colander and I was really confused about how you managed to keep the liquid in.
I love a good handful of nuts
Day 1 - Day 7 Breakfast -Dinner = rice rice and more rice for me :D
I would love to see a La Croix taste test of all of the flavors!!!
What's a 'vegan' chicken pot pie ?
I love food presentation it makes me happy when my plate looks pretty lol
I have a 5 year old and a 3 year old as well!
How did you change that habit from constant soda to tasteless water? Was the transition hard at first? Sorry to ask, I'm just in the same predicament and I would really like to know how you changed your habit.
I wanna be in her family so I can eat the spicy ramen cuz my mom trippin
I was expecting a burp at the end of the video as I've gotten used to....
Portion control has been a big hurdle for me!! I just get so ravenous when I'm hungry! I started drinking a full glass of water before each meal, and it helps a lot :)
I love fizzy water too! My favorite right now is Topo Chico! Especially the one with lime!
Okay so.. I don't eat half that and I'm 3 times bigger. .. I think I need to eat more rice. ....
Hey Emmy. I love in a small town in Northern MI and I would love to try Natto but I don't know where I can get any. Is there a certain place you get yours from? Thanks😊
Do you buy fizzy water or do you have a home machine?
2:30 huh, that's kinda weird that's a pretty seasonal Vietnamese dish we only make close to the Chinese New Year, unless they're frozen and thawed.
I love fizzy water too. It took me ages when i was young to get used to it but again like you. Didn't like still water! Love adding aople juice or something into it :)
I really like the hello fresh recipes. Are you a stay at home mom?
I'd love to see video recipes for some of these things like the udon noodle soup and the Burmese pickled salad.
Do a video of your daily routines
Love your videos so much 😀😀😀
How do you bite so fast at the end xD
I love, love, love your what you eat in a week videos!!!  And I wish I could live with you, because your meals always look soooo fabulous!!!
Would you show us the burrito method? I would vegify it, but the technique is the same x
I like how small your portions are, especially that sandwhich and bagel. Makes me think I should do that too
I eat one maybe twice a day and I eat less then you and somehow I gain weight. How
Udon noodle (thick udon) soup is incredible and very easy to make. I add lots of fish cake, scallops and bok choy. I add 4 eggs on top and also splash my serving with sriracha sauce...mmm. I make my own chicken bone stock first as my base for the udon.\nGreat video and that's why I love Emmy's diversity with her food to show everyone what is yum-yum to eat in this world.\nCHOMP
If someone want's an actual opinion about hellofresh,I'm going to write a bit about them since I'm a customer.\nI buy their three-meal boxes.They cost 39 € (In germany), so this option would cost approximately 46 dollars.Their boxes are indeed somewhat pricy,but the recipees are really varied,especially the vegetarian boxes (which I order) are good to try out some new things.I'm a little bit picky when it comes to food and because I paid for the boxes,I actually try new things,which I normally wouldn't do:D.
the end is gold hahaha :D
Watching this video when you're hungry.. it's just pure torture. Everything looks so good.
Seeing the McDonald's there in your video made me feel so much better. I strayed alway from fast food, but now that I'm working and my son started school, I barely have time to do anything. I definitely need to up my healthy food game though.
I assume you also stay very active, what with having the toddlers. I mention that because I intake about half the calories that you do and actually have issues not gaining weight (but I'm a night person, so my outdoor activities are somewhat limited). (Had I waited a few seconds to comment I would have heard you mention the toddlers and going to the gym).
Try to pan fry the sticky rice cake, cut them into slices and fry until golden brown, it's a treat
thank you for sharing. I love drinking lemon water
gym once a week?!! u joking girl dont lie
I'm glad to see that you're not a crazy health nut and slip in some normal food, even a trip to mcD' s. thanks for being a normal person Emmy
i love oatmeal!! thanks to you,and your advice about portion control, i have gotten slimmer than ive ever been, i am so grateful 💕.
Omg I have been watching you since I was in year 7! Now I am in year 12 almost graduating! kdhkaaihdj
Vegan chicken pot pie? How did you do it!!!!!!!!!
Can you make more recipe videos? I mean of normal food not the you made what?
If you still have some of the saft from IKEA (or something concentrated like it) it is absolutely delicious in sparkling water! We used to have it like soda when I was a kid.
When are you going on Hot Ones?
I loved that we could see you explaining things in this video! I like the other videos but I just really liked this style. Also love the way you put your sponsors in, it isn't annoying and it doesn't take up a huge amount of the video which is nice.
id eat yur poo poo of a dead cat yur sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo entertaining
Wow. That's a lot of grains and carbs. Not into paleo I guess. If I ate that much carbs I would gain lots of weight. But portion control means everything I guess.  That and she's got good genes.
Hey Emmy check out this YouTube channel  Bellaboos lunches the mom makes lunches for her daughter I think you’ll like it
Hi Emmy!  I have been watching and loving your videos for like 3 weeks now. I only just subscribed.  Anyway,  can you suggest some tasty sweet vegetarian eggless recipes for  about say 4 yr olds, maybe something that includes oats/other protein cereal in disguised form. I have a picky eater at home but he enjoys sweets. Love you bye.
CAn you please share your vegan chicken pot pie recipe? As a vegetarian I would love to learn that!
this all looks healthy but if you think about all the carbs @-@ I’d probably gain 10 pounds in a week by this diet. But your food looks so good!!! 😩💕

God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel.

This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk

Im 16 right now and I ain't really had a bad life it's been good just always been short on money so my family struggles a little and this film really helped me because   recently I've not been in the right state of mind like I've been on the edge of throwing away my life and getting involved in things I shouldn't because of the way society is nowadays it just glamorises this kind of badman life and I was seriously considering getting involved in it like one sentence and my life could've been changed In a moment but this film brought me back to reality it really did and I feel it saved me it's a great message man and I think more people need to see this
Dang bro respect

Inspirational
Who the Cap Fit reference in there, greatest Bob Song... nah fuck it, best song period!
did he release the songs separate from the film?????
Amazing ... this needs to be played in schools ... colleges... youth clubs with the message broken down to them \n... so the young black boys and girls/youth of today know they are the master of their own destiny ... #choices... well done #stormzy #solution
10 years on and has anyone asked Carlos yet?
Woah this around 7:20 sounds familiar to one of KSI's disstacks

Wow
Amazing
Who Jah bless\nNo man curse 💓💓
This based on Crazy Titch?
What's the first song that played?
pulled at my heart, many grime(& rap obv) artists have spoken about life on the streets but the way Stormzy breaks it down is undeniable. Big up yourself for keeping it really real <3
yo, the fucking second beat, the orchestral one, it is outta this world.. surely the instrumental is out there somewhere? anyone got it? fucking gassed
Motivational stuff
My man basit main kid in this damn well in G
Luv this, nice job! Would've liked a longer, focused film with more depth, details and showing the climb to success. A more diverse cast would have been 👌 Powerful, necessary, poignant message that (I hope) will hit home for those who need it. Congrats to all involved with this project. Salute!!
stormzy release this song as a single so I can listen to this all the time som1 do it plz
Stormz we need a movie man!!!
This message very much needed to be told
why isint this number one on trending youtube make it happen

Oasis made rock n roll \nStormzy MADE Grime ! \n\nFucking epic on so many levels
Lukaku is on top. Whats the bald man doing in the barbershop?
more of a long music video than a film
When KSI and Lukaku have a child
Jheez, what a role model this man is. GQ man of the year? No-one came close....
One  of   the best films I have ever seen that combines the blood of the street with the spirit of philosophy. Who  Jah bless...tindrum13
Wow this will explode. This is amazing.
Much love from the states fam
New album from Bugzy and geovarn check this out is lit \nhttps://youtu.be/CoIa__NqNkE
2 WAYS ON THE STREETS SHITS YOU BE DEAD OR PRISON MOST DEFINITELY.
Stormzy just tells the truth about everything its what grime should be
yea stormzy we're gonna need a separate video for bad boys
which songs are in there?
Basit is my mate goes to same school
Nice...love the message nuff love from Ny❤️
Stormzy Just raised the bar like if you agree 💪
God didn't give you to hands to sit around praying 😶
Oh damn this actually got more than one dislike.
This is basically a bunch of raps this aint a movies
You know that's Moriarty singing, right?
Pretty much my musical equivalent of a wet dream
Chingue a su madre el América :v
I was there last night - what a great gig!
He looks just like a drunken man singing badly
what an happy song, mr berninger
OMGG Namjoon looks so hot with that hair!! and Taehyung and Jin with headbands!! Then there's Yoongi's being swagg and savage August D , Jungkook's slaying those dance moves,Jimin with his soulder accidents and HOBIIIIIIIIII JUST KILLING US ALL HE WAS MADE FOR THIS STYLE,ON FIRE !!
guyssss we need to vote just proceed to google and search Mwave vote Dna you must log in first the voting is freeze we need our boys to be no. 1 fighting armyssss
we will burst like cola's omg their way with words is too clever, hats off to the people who wrote this song I really really like this songs, if I could hug this song I would hug it million times !!!!
I just died on the last part where Jungkook and Jimin sang 😍😍😍heart eyes all the way.
who tf was booing at the start , turn on your location ...
CRAZY PERFORMANCES CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF BTS & THOSE FANCHANTS INCREDIBLE LOVE BTS MUSIC AND PERFORMANCES
Watching 3:06-3:16\nSuddenly\nMe: my heart, my heart\n*Dies of heart attack*\n Namjoon when did you become this sexy.\n My hearteu. I'm in so much pain because of u *Rap monster*\n\nGuys help me. I can't stop replaying it.
Did you see my bag\n\n\nTae: ITS GUCCI BAG\n\n\nLOL
Suga should trademark that baby blue hair style, No one can rock it like him.
the way my boys walked out tho 🔥
Me @ who gave Jin and Taehyung bandanas: Keep doing what you're doing. You're doing amazing sweetie.
Fashion is on point
I heard 0:33 while doing my homework, i just can't omgg my ears my mind and my soul has been attacked. i cant
U ALL BETTER STOP
song:Drop The Mic!!!Suga:Bish Nah *Throws Mic Instead Of Dropping*
At 1:32 Jin really looks like jisoo!❤️
My left ear overhearing someone (jimin or jungkook?) Moaning ahh at 0:34 k bye
Impactada
namjoon is gorgeous oh my god
Jung kook 😍
Jim is my fav.
Woaa jimin oppa is so sexy ÷.÷ Im dead
JHOPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!! 💓💓💓💓💓
Rapmonster's stylist needs a *rAISE*
Rapmon is that you? wth sooooo handsome!
Suga part 0:51 it the BESTtttttt💓
HATERS BYEEEEEE
Jungkook's dance at busy killed me right there 😱 rapmonster and suga's rapping hold too much passion for me to handle 👀 and and.. OMG jimin's hip dance,j-hope's starting, jin's last part of song, tae's voice 😍😍😍 everything is just too perfect ❤
Ok so maybe it's because it's 3am in the morning but I am crying over how good Yoongi looks like why.... I am being bias wrecked by my bias how is it even possible to look that hot ;-;
CAN WE TALK ABOUT NAMJOON'S HAIR OR WHAT CAUSE DAMN
This is soo good\nWhy am I crying?
I'm FIRIN FIRIN LIKE A TORCHBEARER!
I'm sorry I'm 100% OT7 but Mic drop is Jin finding his natural swag and literally turning up the sexy. My poor heartu - on the other hand besides all the continuous wrecking I for one am thoroughly enjoying this comeback.
NAMJOON!!!! Jesus...
*_OKAY BUT NAMJOON LOOKS HELLA FINE IN HERE_* 😍🔥
suga killed it!!! mic drop !!
the way jimin shakes im shook💦😩
SeokJin 😍😍😳😳👏👏👏👏👏👏y so perfect
Namjoon meu utt
Bts
oh my god Namjoons hair!!
J-hoooooope my love, Much sexy
Jin's part at the end gives me chills
So I was being shocked with each and every member, I was like J-HOOOPE, and then SUGAAA and then EVERYBODY IS SO GOOD WHY NO STAHP. Honestly this is just so good, the song, the choreo, their voices, their moves, THEIR FREAKING HAIR
J-Hope fits so well in this concept
JHope really stands out in this song for me, he's not even my bias but he really kills this song. Also Suga is totally sexy at 1:00
Perfect song to perform at the BBMA 😊
the end breaks ma heart\nWHAT IF THEY BREAK APART AND NEVER MAKE BOOTYFUL MUSIC AGAIN (i mean, you know, last goodbye and all dat stuff)
this is so intense, damn
THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST MY FAVORITE CONCEPT; BANGTAN, HIP HOP LOVERS. i cri.
The beat little bit similiar to No More Dream, so everytime i hear this song. I thought it was NMD( lel, srry 4 bad eng)
Bts killing me every minute they need to stop (NOT)
Holyy watermelon..taehyung in military outfit is my new kink
BTS SLAY
Can Jimin always wear that outfit
AWESOME
Jimin looks so handsome😭😍😍💙
I love you,BTS!!!💘😍💫
I love jimin's natural black hair but I think this colour makes him look even better. I like R.M hair too.
IM SO TRIGGERED JIMINS ROLLIE WAS BETTER THAN ANY GIRL IN THIS WORLD, BANDANA TAEHYUNG YES PLEASE, NAMJOONS HAIR OMFG F U C K M E U P YOONGIS MIC DROP HAD ME JUNGSHOOK I CANNOT \n\n\n\n\n\n\nkay I'm calm.
My heart is beating so fast I'm falling so hard for them all over again ❤️
jhope SLAYED this performance <3 <3 <3
:D
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90h8g28sodA\nplease come check it out
Can we talk about 3:16 ?\nKIM NAMJOON WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU DOING SMIRKING THROUGH YOUR JACKET WITH THOSE EYES??? HOLY-
THIS FUCKIN FEELS LIKE I'M WATCHING SHOW ME THE MONEY OH MY GOSH!!!! BANGTAN'S HIPHOP IS DAMN ON POINT AND TAEHYUNG HOW DARE YOU!!!!!!!!
Oh w o w 1.25x is LiT
Jimins accidents and wet hair is what I live for!!
DAMN THEY LOOK SO GOOD
Imagine how proud their parents are😭💖💖
MISSING: Some bag BTS lost.\nIf found, please return to ×××××. REWARD: 3 dollars.
oh god i've forgotten about cypher holy shit
jimin is voice made me fascinated.
JIN stob it! 💣💥🔥💣💥🔥💣💥🔥
YES SLAY ME KING TAEHYUNG
Jin KILLED it
Rude
That walking out is orgasmic how eveb
jimin's dance is crazily powerful... I'm shook
Our Littile Mochi chim be like:\n\nJimin: old chim cant go throught the phone right now\nWhy? oh cz hes dead\n\n😍😍😍😍😍

Hoseok slays in this song
KINGS
1:37 Jhope is enjoying it...❤😘
bandanna jhope is baaaackckckkckckcc
Taehyung really look handsome
BTS is currently killing me 🔥💯
❤❤😍😍😍😻😻😻
Anyone else besides me wants to see J Hope with some dreads on when he sings this song?
that line how dare you that refers to unlike the videos and haters😱
Hobi...so cool the rest as well ....love BTS
okay, but can we pls talk about tae's hair in this? It's RUDE. RUDE. OKAY? RUDE.
Omg Taehyung look so tired 3:26 😥😥😥
v s look hot
J_hope ❤️🤤
you suck worse thing i ever heard you chinesse gang
Jon was absolutely brilliant, he should host every year. Pity the audience were filled with people so full of their own self importance.
HE CAME AND HE CONQUERED WITH THAT SHIT ROFL LOVE YOU JON <3
dodies was the tamest but probably hurt the most
I died at the Shay Carl part
He is a dickkk
HAHAHAHA this is so good
Finally a reason to watch  the streamys
HANNAH’S FACE WHEN HE ROASTED HER IS SO AMAZING IM DEAD😂😂
The one with who shaycarl is texting really got to me but I couldn’t stop laughing
I was surprised when he mentioned Dodie seeing as they possibly dated in the past haha
Is there an instrumental version of this
THE SHAY CARL ONE I CANTTTT
i bloody love this
That first one about shaycarl was good I started yelling oh
I don’t get Tyler Oakley’s part
I need a teeny tiny Jon cozart to carry around so he could be roasty-sassy narrating my life x)
Jon: When you ask Who's that cutie with the big brown eyes? I say that's *Thomas Sanders* 
Liza was dying when she was called out
Hit a High At The Tyler Oakley part Than downhill
He's such a fuckin savage honestly I adore him, he's got no shame
Jake Paul is like Hillary Clinton
THAT FUCKING AUDIBLE NO WHEN HE MENTIONED SHAY CARL LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
JON FUCKING KILLED IT THE AUDIENCE SHOULD BE ASHAMED
i kind of got defense wen he diged at jenna like how dare you go after the queen
HAHAHAHAH THE BLACKFISH JOKE WAS SO GOOD
Omlllll JESUS THAT WAS SAVAGE BUT THE AUDIENCE WAS SHITTTT
This was great, but the shay carl one was kind of a low blow...
Superwoman stood up at the end cus she knew how good he was ❤️❤️
Why is everyone shaming the audience for being stuck ups when they're obviously muted? You can clearly see them laughing and reacting and applausing through the whole thing.
I can help but think of Jon Cozart as a bad ass mix of bo burnham and John mulaney
he literally burned them to death
Liza puts so much effort into her outfits for award shows and David just wears a shirt and jeans
They all take themselves so seriously wow. Jon was amazing!
0:45 \nWhose the cutie with the big brown eyes\nI say that's Cameron Dallas just some internet guy ❤
Shane went with Ryland! Omigosh!!! I'm dying in a sea of cuteness
WHY IS THIS NOT ON YOUR CHANNEL BRO????
I needed to pause, I'm feeling the youtubers burns
The 'end memorium' line was brilliant
Nobody is ready for his genius cynicism.
Hundred layers of daddy issues *takes long breath* OOOOOOOOHHHHHHHH
The Shane Dawson one was kinda: méh
Everyone criticizing the audience for not laughing wtf did you even watch it
are people not laughing bc they didn't find it funny or bc they didn't wanna offend anyone lol
Dont worry your career will be featured on the end memorium part\nJon has just turned into a savage ass mfuckin machine gun
Look at these 'internet stars' who think they're all that they can't even appreciate satire. This is why the world thinks being an internet celebrity is a joke. These people genuinely think they're too good to be roasted. Jon is a legend for this.
THANK YOU FOR THIS\nalso Jenna sat next to ned from buzzfeed wow
I love this too much hahaha
This is the most performances I've ever seen
If you guys want to know Jon's YT channel, it's 'Paint' just for people who want to know.
This Audience could make any person feel self conscious about their comedic personality. 🤔🙄
Btw: hearing the audience from Simply Nailogical Snapchat story, the audience was pretty loud during his sets. Maybe it was because the audience mics weren't on or they didn't have enough mics to fill the audience
Most of them are New York Times bestselling authors, don't you read?? That's totally fine, neither do they! LOLOLOL
The shay joke had a bitch QUAKING
OMG ITS A ROAST PLS GET OVER IT AND JUST LAUGH. Holy shit
Holy crap he threw more than shade he threw the whole damn tree
jon is a legend, what a shame most of these youtubers had a stick too far up their asses to recognize it
Jon Cozart is the best!
Is he ever gonna upload a video on his channel again?
He's gonna go far, not afraid to be non PC in a time where doing so can get you in a whole lot of trouble. This is what comedy needs.
I saw Stevie Wonder <3
the shay carl joke was craazzzyyy
Cute fire
Omfg I love Jon Cozart😂❤️😂❤️
holy shit
THIS WAS SO SHADY IM LIVIN
I love this
This is HILARIOUS.
2:07
<3 Lovely.
Yesss Jonathan yassssss
OH SHIT
Wow that started dark
That Shay joke was toooo real omg
I LOVE YOU OMG
Jon Cozart is still alive?
1.34 just hear Mamrie screaming yeahhh!
Hahaha
He's so cute singing infront of people being shy ...... Im lik Awwwwwwwwww soooooooo cuuuutttteee!!!!😍😍😍😍
cringe
Shay Carl = Dead
How dare you roast Liza?!?
Is that Tessa brooks ant 3:10
OMG THE BIT ABOUT SHAYCARL
Savage af
NOOO YOU MOTHERFUCKE- I WILL END YOU-
Spirit animal- right there
I LOVE JON
Stevie and Dodie are sooo cute
SAVAGE
OMG SAVAGE
#dragged
Ss)))i
Liza:true, true
2:47 she said YOU MOTHERFU**** LOL
I LOVE THIS😂
JON IS AMAZING AH
At least Liza and Lilly laughed.
Why would you bring up BLACKFACE NOT OK! AND I THINK SHANE APOLOGIZED FOR THAT AND REGRETS THAT!
White, straight male roasting successful women, apparently this talentless slut didn't had enough attention 😒
What's the ShayCarl diss? Texting?
So this is how they make those cool screen savers...
this is a home made XY occiloscope
Anyone know what kind of laser he used? If not, at least a similar one?
I spy, with my little eye, Lissajous patterns! :D
Good thinking putting the watermark over the “exciting bits” that people would try to freeboot.
Very cool.  I'm going to start playing with this immediately.\nThis reminds me a lot of an on the cheap laser effect my astronomy professor built in the college planetarium for some of our rock shows.  He had spinning double-mirror arrangement that would get bumped/vibrated by a small subwoofer next to it for a similar effect (though only to the bass).  It would spirograph to the beat and bass line, and then he would kick on a fan blade of sorts to break up the beam.  It would dart around like a firefly on crack.  Pretty damn cool for late-eighties homemade!
I wonder how it'll look in slow motion
I don't know why you'd need JavaScript to to precisely control the frequency of sine waves when there are very sophisticated programs available for precision control of sound. \nThey can even do fancy things like square waves, saw waves and realtime filtering!\nThe best thing is many are available for free and for your iOS device!\n\nAnyhow ... please download a synthesizer and do this again, I'd like to see how more complex wave shapes or filters would effect the laser.
I think the laser pulsate at a very high frequence. This is so cool !!
Play something on an electric piano hooked to the speaker
I would love to make a visualizer like this, and it should be fairly easy, but....  Is there a nice membrane that would get a similar visual effect but would not distort the sound too much?
Because of how the laser takes such a long path, is the point at which the laser is pointing and moving, faster than the speed of light which makes it path visible?
So can a video file be converted to its raw data, mostly binary, then played over the horizontal (ish) moving freq ....would that yield a 3d video (of sorts) like the later clips presented (where there was a clear top & bottom to the figure with diagonal lines between them)?? Thanks for the video...😃
The intro vibrated the toast I was eating... that felt weird.
*IT'S OSCILLATING IN THE 5TH DIMENSION*
What the frick. That is super crazy awesome! Have you looked at all at relative frequencies (like a fifth) and if they resemble each other even with different pitches? Does A+E look at all like F+C? Or the same interval an octave lower or higher? Absolutely fascinating! Makes me want to go experiment!!
Maybe that's how an alien might see sound
I think the loose ends are caused by the rolling shutter effect, look it up, it’s cool
I knew the government were controling our minds with laser beams. Chem trails my ass the government have hippie wizards with portable speakers causing natural disasters and 9/11.
4th dimensional stuff going on there
Goddamit, Mould.  I held off watching this vid over other recommendations ... coz how much more science can there be really?  There was a lot of info in this vid, and you presented it all beautifully as usual. I never have a need to rewind or rewatch your vids because I missed something. Thank you again :)
you should try to make the but without a wall make the laser scatter off clouds instead of a wall.\nthe point is to visualize it in 3D instead of 2D..
The multiple start end points may be because the way the shutter moves, the bottom of the frame is captured slightly later in time than the top.
How does the code work? How to use it?
Steve! Please do this same experiment with the radio resonances of the different planets of the solar system! It'll be sick!
4:58 did you mean set your camera to auto?
So many of these look so 3 dimensional. Makes to think about how much everything is connected through mathematics...
You should play jerobeam fenderson on it.
I'd love to see these side-by-side with an oscilloscope!
i wonder if the mirror was moving out from under the laser when it had multiple ends and starts?
Great video thanks :)
2:35 this funny pattern here\nIt's a dick.
The reason for the many ends is the rolling shutter
Why the broken lines?  Easy... It's just the laser missing the mirror when it oscillates too far.
4:57 set camera to manual? 5:12 better set camera to manual?
the extra start and end points are likely cause by the rolling shutter effect
would the light just take the frequencies and display the songs notes on the wall and the switching is just the rapid notes being displayed?
After watching this video, I knew I had to try this. The fun lasted all about 5 minutes, when I learned that dollar store laser pointers don’t last particularly long.
That's cool, some of those figures are typical lissajous patterns ... didn't expect them to show up so clearly!
Actually, it is the way our inner ear works. We hear geometric patterns.
The multiple ends are because of the rolling shutter effect
That effect of having multiple lines in a frame could be that your cameras light sensor segments read each pixel in a line by line format. So as the laser was moving around it might if moved in and out of where the line that was being read at the time was. This is why we get the slanting effect when the camera is moving steadily sideways. The lines at the top or bottom are read first and then each successive line of light sensor segments is read slightly after the first
It would be interesting to put two pieces of glass each with their own laser at different locations on the balloon and see how different the projected shapes are simultaneously.
I so have to try this.
Could you not have just opened windows media player for the same effect haha
Can we get a full video of just the lazer so we can watch all of it?
Nice. Now record that bitch in slowmotion.
Maybe because the laser is not hitting the mirror? I mean, it's too small so the vibrations of the baloon membrane could be extreme enough that the laser misses the mirror's aperture
I wonder if using a square container would change the shape since the balloon would be stretched differently.
Did you use Spaces or Tabs in your code?
I feel like in staring into the 4th dimension
This needs some square waves.
Used to make these for parties in the 90's. 1st surface mirror glued to a speaker and then shot through a spinning quartz crystal.
If you hook up the left and right channels of a stereo output to an oscilliscope and, holding one note steady, scan the other note through an octave, say, the harmonics visualization is great. Use the lissajous mode on the oscilliscope which centers each input on 0,0 of an x/y axis. The headphone output of a cheap keyboard is a common available source. The flute or ?French horn might give the best sine wave for the cleanest visualization.
Vectorscope, it looks just like it, search up oscilloscope music it looks cool
To understand where there is more than one starting point you should watch you this excellent video explaining and showing in detail why this happens... https://youtu.be/CmjeCchGRQo
That's a great low tech solution to visualising sound.
I'm so intrigued by how many of them look like they could be a 3D shape rotating in space...
it's like a 3d render with laser
I wonder what this would look like if you used a piece of a DVD instead of the mirror. I guess it would be interesting to combine it with the interference pattern produced by the DVD.
I can't help but feel David Gilmour ought to use this. \n(Seeing how he's still all about them lasers ;)
I think is because of the rolling shutter
It would be interesting if the results are better if filmed with 60fps
I ran across this video today and it looks very similar to this but is using a completely different method. Its called the shape of music, He has more information on how it works in the description. Are these two methods similar in any way? https://youtu.be/8TxTilR7xu8
Really nice idea! What would be also very interesting to know, is if you can predict a composite wave form from two separate ones by addtion of the xy traces. Also what would be an effect of an offset related to that.\n\nIn a similar sense ... what would happen if one could take the surface of a disco ball onto a speaker and shine light onto it, or several lasers? What I wonder, would it be possible to see some complete image of the membrane?
You mean auto not manual lol
OMG MY FRIEND AND I JUST TRIED IT AND IT'S AMAZING WTH WHO THOUGHT OF THIS I JUST WANT TO HUG THAT PERSON
This is called a lissajouls figure
6:09 >i don't think it's because the laser pulses, otherwise i would have noticed it watching it live\n\nNo, you really wouldn't have.  \n\nDiodes can be PWM pulsed very quickly, faster than the human eye can hope to see.  LEDs for example are typically pulsed at thousands of pulses per second, the human eye thinks it's just dimming but in reality it's turning full-on & full-off thousands of times per second.
The single frame with many lose ends, could it be because the laser leaves the mirror?
My first thought would be rolling shutter, but it doesn't have the right artifacting. It could be the physical properties of the mirror fragment itself (such as it being too small, the glass taking an internal reflection, etc.). A high speed camera would really be the only thing I could think of to answer that question.
While this a beautiful demo, I can't help but feel that the mirror shard's asymmetry affected the vibrating membrane and gave an unpure reading of the tones you used. Also, why place the mirror somewhere other than the center of the membrane? From the Chladni experiment we know certain sections of the membrane vibrate differently than others for a given time, why not place mirrors at nodes & antinodes and repeat the experiment and compare the laser paths? \n\nSemi-related, I know you're interested in visualizing sound, I think liquid cymatics could be a rad project for you (especially using mercury on a speaker with lasers)
Instead of you talking to the camera do voiceover. We came here for the laser not for you.
There's probably a mathematical way to play a certain frequency to make any shape you want
It would be interesting to teach an AI which sounds create which shapes, and then use it to generate a desired shape by calculating what type of waveform needs to be produced.
What if you put a Shepard tone
It will be awesome if you do the same but with Jerobeam Fenderson’s Oscilloscope Music!\nMaybe the patterns produced with that music can be visible with your laser-mirror system.
I'm pretty sure (correct me if i'm wrong) that the segmentation on the freeze frame is due to the way a laser works. it pulses a light on a tube of some crystal, the electrons absorb the energy then emit it again slowly at all the same frequency and direction. then it pulses again. so maybe there's your answer. I'm not sure though
This was really good. Gj
I made some java-script programs a few years ago to draw Lissajous figures and cycloids which look similar to some of those. Sorry that but you need a khan academy user to view them. https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/mouse-operated-spline-oscilloscope/5921753556320256
This was so cool. Instantly my mind jumped to string theory and what strings of vibrating energy look like.
Discount oscilloscope music?\n\nAlso, does the position of the mirror affect the shape? My hypothesis would say yes, however I don't have the resources to experiment at this moment.
Use oscilloscope music. I want to see if it will still create the same effect.
Those are Lissajous (after the mathematician who first described them)patterns. I thought they were purely theoretical being the quotient of waves. But they do appear in multidimensional membranes as seen here.
Put the laser and speaker in a vacuum and slowly decrease the amount of air and observe how the patterns change
That was cool
brilliant
Amazing
*automatic
Strings theory
...also, crazy eyes at 1:44

Resonant constellations are fascinating. Reminds of UFOs.
Two words: Rolling Shutter
Holy shitballs Steve, brilliant upload!
This is cool
Mesmerizing
my brain exploded at exactly 2:52
THIS IS AMAZING
You should do oscilloscope music
I watched the movie on [ bit.ly/2xyHW6p?720p ] and it's a good movie!
Love mafia movies !  Now that Sammy is out of jail again I wonder if anyone will make their bones killing the rat. Doing him has got to be a move up in ranks!  I couldn't understand how Hill made it to old age.

Looks soo bad. The hbo gotti film better than that lol
Discover the man who showed the world who's boss....nice job with that tagline Kevin Connelly or whoevers idea it was to put that in there, glorifying a fucking criminal as if what his life consisted of was a cool thing. Hypermachismo bullshit. THIS is the kind of shit that continues that mentality with men that being a criminal is cool and influences that notion of arrogance along with hypermasculinity. Mobsters are not good people, we shouldnt shed a positive light on the things that do considering they purposefully have every intention of doing the criminal shit they do. Nothing is an accident
Looks trash.. like a comedy drama
and next year (2018) John Travolta in another movie that is called Trading Paint I have some videos of the filamacion in my Youtube channel
Gotti is lucky,even dead,he's being portrayed by a legend like John Travolta .I'm watching this!!
Seriously questioning the casting choice here.
nice looks like John made it tm2 da top again.
Bout fuckin time... THEY been holding this movie for like 3yrs
A coworkers husband grew up in Gotti's neighborhood. He said it was the safest place in America.
We walk togetha, we fall togetha, this is the life
In the future could an AI robot that gets super smart to a god like state, be the future antichrist or beast of the book of revelaton???\nhttps://youtu.be/g_IEZxtvxx0
armand assante did great as gotti,travolta is great but i dont think he can top his performance.What do u guys think.
John Travolta was a horrrrrrrrrrible choice for this role. He's like 75 years ago.
If this is not epic I will be pissed !
I grew up in Ozone Park Queens during the years Gotti was there. Looking forward to seeing the movie.
Edward James Olmos would of made a way better gotti than travolta! travolta looks too damn weak for this role
He seems to be more Travolta than the real Gotti. He should be more like Gotti than just act like a gangster.
Can't wait to see this!
John gotti wasn't a faget like john travel to
Kevin Gates is definitely going to be watching this movie
I heard John Gotti could make a mean plate of spaghetti
the gambinos actually run a distribution warehouse for macys in la mirada ca, funny thing is i never knew that till i met one of them they still have the same type of im better mentality
Could this mean an Academy Award for Travolta? Hope so. Waiting for reviews, but still might see the movie.
Wtf why is he so old. Man, time flies so fast he is such a legend.
Another botched Gotti movie. Man, this dead guy can't catch a break.
Never been a Travolta fan, but this looks good.
Looks interesting sign me up
Looks Great!!! JOHNNY IS DA MAN
FUCK ALL THE HATERS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ALL USE TO TRY TO PLAY GOTTI, EASY TO JUDGE
Ummmmm they forgot to put Yo in  title too
Awesome,  can't wait.  Hope Hollywood doesn't gay it up like everything else.
🍿 🔴 *Gotti 2OI7* Mᴏᴠɪᴇ https://naver.pe/ff420jhj0i
The man who destroyed the Gambino crime family and drew the mafia into the public eye
By the by Robert denro and pesci  were supposed to be in this but the director fucked it up
Italian gangsters in New York? Just call Jon Bernthal. He'll know what to do...
Move To Google And then Type: *gamesecrxguide facebook* This happens to be the only working facebook h@ck tool working from this month. Dont waste your entire free time in other tools
Martin Scorsese should've directed this.
What's the point of watching the film now, just saw the best parts
Will Leah be making an appearance?
you cannot go wrong with Travolta as a bad guy...should be interesting
JEWS in hollywood insulted Gotti by letting Travolta play his part a knoe bisexual fat fuck tard...portraying a nyc tough guy\n\n\nliberal horseshit and mind fuck towards the snow flakes
Watching the trailer is enough to see that Armand looks and talks just like Gotti, Travolta doesn't even come close.
this trailer is just a summary of the whole movie
I don't see this making a big splash in the Box Office, Travolta is a good actor but he cant play a wise guy... Remakes are never a good thing... Hopefully it's a good movie. I'll watch only cuz of Travolta.
what happened in between season 1 & season 2
I like the 1st gotti movie. still might give this a chance but the 1st was well scripted
We walk together we fall together. This is the life
JOHN GOTTI Italian anti culture\nI hope some African American\nit puts your wife aside to your children\nyou've been able to create 100 years of our grandparents, fathers, and ladies\nthe ladies did not move without her husband\nyour wife was fucked by prison guards\ninfamous
Who would cast this fag to play Gotti?
John travolta does what he is best at by playing the bad guy.
I want to see it but Travolta is a mad man and Scientologist
They ruined it by putting Travolta in it. Thumbs down!
So no credit to Kevin gates for makeing his name known again💯💯
What's the point of this movie? It's not going to top Gotti with Armand Assante.
Didn't know John Gotti was gay.
This looks real good! JT back @ it!!!
HBO made band of brothers and the pacific. just for those two It's worth watching it. (Without forgetting john Travolta YOLO)
Can't you see that I'm trying to watch this third rate Goodfellas that I found at the bus station?
This fagget always played a good bad guy
looks great cant wait to see it
Gotti would be so upset to be portrayed by a man who wants other men to massage his butthole. Ha ha ha. I was never impressed with Gotti. He was just a thug more or less. He wasn't as smart as the bosses before him.
looks like an oscar nomination for this scientology wad and an oscar meyer in his mouth. not thats there  anything wrong with that.
John Travolta does seem to age..
I don't think I've ever been this excited to see a movie after seeing the preview.
They should of got Martin Scorsese as the Director
Yes get a gay fagget to play gotti good job
Be great if not for John the dick sucker
That looks epic if you ask me!!
Bro anytime I click on a movie trailer, a fucking iTunes movies ad pops up.
Why do they films about these people? You play right into their hands and make them heroes whether you want to or not. It seems like doing bad things get you more recognition than doing good things.
Travolta looks like Bill Clinton not John Gotti.
🔥🔥New American Hype 🔥🔥힙합 음악을 녹음하는 법
FAGGOTTI
Rick Flair could play a good Gotti
lol John Faggot Travolta, Scientology queer as john gotti?, no thanks I wont watch this crap, and fuck john Travoltas gay ass
Sammy the bull turn down Gotti after Gotti destroy Gambino...
I feel john Gotti
HA GOTTI
Gotti rolling in his grave
Nice
Oh yeah him
How bout Leah Gotti? Am I right boys?
http://quamiller.com/zsJ\nNew Action Movies HD
You better call Saul !
spoiler alert .... \n\n\n\n\n...its gonna be awesome!!!!!!
GOTTI-eeeem.
Film about a snitch.
Teflon don
OMG Spencer Lofranco is HOT -0:32
gotti familiia approves of a gay man playing john?\nvery broad minded of em.\ncongrats.
Who the fuck thought travolta can play gotti? Armand assanti killed that role. Anyone who saw that knows this. Travolta looks like hes on SNL playing a mafia character lmao!
Anyone else tired of gangster movies ?
Didn't anybody tell him Armand Asante did a much better version for HBO?
Armand assanti  was the best gotti what is this shit
This looks really weak
Hw do they have this fucking gay playing John gotti smh
Can't beat Assante as Gotti
I really like that this video wasn't just about buying loads of new stuff 🙌
I love the jumper and sweet skirt combo! xxx
I remember finding you through your ' how I style docs' video😊
Love when you break down trends!!! 👍🏼👍🏼 yay 😊
I love red, so that is a trend I am looking forward to. And I like the print you showed, will need to check out some thrift shops.
Inasmuch as I love this style of video, I'll always have a soft spot for your old LookBook style videos shot in your house. I still go back to those when I'm in a style rut!
I like these kinds of videos. If you like this you should also check out KarenBritChick. She does these kinds of fashion style videos all the time.
I’ve been following you for so many years and it’s amazing to see how much you’ve grown 💖💖 love you sam
The curly hair suits you so well! I love it
Amazing Samantha! For advice on relationship, friendships and more - check us out! :)
I loved this video so much Sammi! it was so nice to hear you suggest that you could get a prince of wales check blazer from a charity shop and that you can pair items we already have for the oversize jumper over skirt trend! ☺️💕 I know it's common sense that you don't need to buy new stuff all the time to be on trend, but it's always nice to have sustainable shopping suggested from a blogger! all the outfits were lovely as always xx
Love everything apart from the kitten heels, im never going to be able to jump on that fashion train! x
Aaaah love the colder seasons fashion so much! Great video Sammi :))
I always like your videos even though I can't wear anything you style because I live on an island. 😭
I love the mirror selfies!
For the instagram: I like a mix of both. Everything doesn't have to be perfect
Hey not one to comment but I love the mirror pics and selfies, I think your casual but chic posts set you apart from all the overly polished content online, plus those type of posts make it a bit easier for me to imagine how I could actually wear such looks in day to day to life. Just love seeing the looks you put together really, so keep doing what you're doing and whatever you enjoy the most ❤️❤️
I love your fashion videos!!
Love this video! More please! ♡
Also, just watching old vids and realized how much I miss the kaleidoscope intro!
I love your fashion videos! they're always super helpful!
I remember watching you when you wore your Docs and chunky shoes. Bring em back! =) Love watching your videos as alway, Sam. You brighten my day.
This earrings suits you soo much Sam! I 'm waiting for some ootd videos! xx
I prefer mirror pictures because they are more accessible and I feel like I could relate to that style of picture more.
Sammi I love your style! You're so good at putting outfits together that flow really well!
Right before you said it I was thinking those trousers would look good with a red jumper 😂  I've also seen a lot of extremely pointy boots out and about but they look kind of clown-ish to me 🤷‍♀️
I love how down to earth you are! Professional pics are neat, but mirror pics are definitely more relatable and are still great!
Definetly the mirror selfies, they just have this effortless and casual feel to them. Whereas the more professional shots are a little more clean cut. \nDoes that make sense? Lmao. \nBoth are stunning though!
You should release a red jumper with Novem & Knight!!!!
ive been a subscriber since ur doc martens days omg!! time flies!!!!
You look so stunning in this video!
I just want to go out buy so much more clothes than what I was already thinking about! Love this video!
What i love about your fashion videos is that it inspires me to be braver with my own personal style. Now i'll actually take the plunge and wear something i like even if it's a bit out there and it's a great feeeling  xx
Love love love your fashion videos ! And i dont mind both for your outfit photos. Love checking out your instagram stories about your outfit and Indie as well ❤️
I really like your hairstyle like that ☺️
Loved all the pieces but the sequins blazer was my favorite😍
I've just seen that Zara has a quilted scarf. That might be a way to get the puffy bomber look without being overwhelming. #teampetite
I've just bought an oversized grey/brown check blazer and i love it but have no idea how to style it! any suggestions?
I like this kinda neutral sage green or slate blue color on stove pipe dress slacks. The pants are kinda high waisted with deeper pockets and are worn with a rugged boot. I kinda like the professional Instagram photos.
I love your style, you are and have been for years an inspiration to me <3\nI prefer more laid back insta pictures! They are so much more authentic :)
where is that lovely red floral tea dress from ? x
WHAT LIPSTICK IS THAT?! You're always, always, always SO gorgeous
Love videos like this!
I think Polka Dots are also a thing this season !!! I see them every where & instead of red , maroon jumpers is a huge trend !!! Goes go well with the checkers x planning to do something like this on my blog soon !
I think a variety is good, but I prefer selfie, mirror pictures. It's nice to see more selfies and mirror pictures just to remember that you are just a normal person like your followers. A lot of fashion YouTubers are leaning more towards the professional side of things and sometimes it's nice to be able to relate to you on some level, if that makes sense!
This is awesome video. Great creation\nif you want to like this just come to My channel and subscribe my channel.\nhttps://youtu.be/fz9cEb_6fl4\nCreate a good comment and like my video\nhttps://youtu.be/qk-ekQuK2Gk
The check print is called Glen plaid (which is short for Glen Urquhart plaid) or Glenurquhart check
I love these videos Sammi!! And I love how excited you are, it makes me so excited to shop too - you're so bad for my bank balance! xx
I like seeing both for sure but more mirror pics!
I like both! Sometimes I like to see something really pro and full of effort, but sometimes it's nice to just see a regular person taking a regular photo in front of a mirror! (Possibly stuck all the crap things in the room to where you can't see in the pic.)\nLove you!!
The red jumper and skirts with oversized sweaters are my favourites! 😍 Love it. \nAnd I'm loving your lipstick, your hair and your shirt in this video. 😍😍 You always look so good! \nLoved the video 💕
The kitten heel... it's a no from me 🙈
Loving these videos on upcoming trends and how to incorporate them!
Love love loved this! I feel so inspired now thank you! x
This is your best makeup look! 💄
love the format of you vids sami
This filming background is SO nice 😍
Sammi you'll love this site for all these trends! https://imaginebykim.nl/collections/newin
You're makeup looks amazing in this video! That lip is everything!
No disrespect but other than the 40s blue and the red autumnal boots most of the other pieces reminds me of the story ‘the emperors new clothes’, kinda.
I would LOVE to have this grey jumper!!! I even wanted it last year.. but shipping to germany and from pounds to euro is just toooo expensive for just one jumper.. I wait till payday or you post a coupon code :D:D
very good video! so put together and insipring! thank You! so professional, Sammy!
hi where is your gold lamp from?! :)
Love this! I'm pregnant with twins and seriously don't know how I'm going to find anything in trend for my growing body, knowing colours and patterns will really help! Also I love your selfie posts 📸 xx
I like a combination of professional photos and selfies! They both show something different :)
Im not into any of those trends. Except red bc it's my favourite colour. But i dont get the trend of the biiiig jackets/coats and wide shoulders. And shiny clothing ugh \nTbh i personally think it's not important to follow trends. It's better to build a solid wardrobe and then maybe buy a few pieces here and there and personalise everything
Try reserved for a red jumper! They have the nicest roll neck xxxx
Are those bomber jackets? Most of the pictures you showed are puffa jackets
Where is that red flower dress from @ 8:27?  I can't find it in the discription box :(
👍🇺🇸🇬🇧🇺🇸🇬🇧💞💕💞💕💞💕💞💤💤💤💤💤💤🌐 you have beautiful hand Sammy I got interrupted the first time I washed your blog great blog as usual Kansas City Missouri
I love the look of your N&K jumper but it doesn’t say what it’s made of......could you let me know? X
Love that red is in! This was a really helpful run down, loved it 💗🍂
Hey Samantha, if you're worried about the oversized bomber trend not suiting your short frame (same tbh) Ariana Grande has been known to wear them from time to time and she is next level tiny! You may have already seen it since it's a little old now but check out her music video for Everyday for some inspo. Not a plug but shorties like us can definitely pull off all the trends too!
always enjoy your fashion videos :) I like both types of instagram pics - I think it's good to have some of both as it keeps it looking sophisticated but real
Hi Sam, personally I like a mix of professional shots and mirror pics, but I also like whatever gets us more outfit pictures!
oh, i wait your vlog like before, with dogs, kichen, living room :) http://www.asos.fr/prettylittlething/prettylittlething-robe-en-maille-a-manches-volantees/prd/8438540?clr=rouge&SearchQuery=robe+en+maille+rouge&pgesize=36&pge=0&totalstyles=42&gridsize=3&gridrow=3&gridcolumn=1
the puffy bomber is one of my favourite wardrobe pieces cause it instantly makes your outfit trendy
Loving statement earrings on you! You look great in this video.
You look gorgeous!! Where is your necklace from?
Girl first of all this was amazing, you are amazing! I love your videos to the moon and back, truly! And to answer your question I actually like the mirror pics more than the professional shots (although those are marvelous too) as I feel like they're a bit more charming and relatable. So much love to you and your lovely family! xxx
Hi Sammy! You're looking gorgeous! I loved the video but I think you shoud have mentioned the vinyl trend and showned your H&M skirt, I have one too and I'm in love with it :D!! Love from Portugal XXx
Love your fashion videos Sam!!!
Loooooove the earrings Sammi!
Reds & sequins not for me👎
I love you!
Mirror pics!! <3
Selfie pics for sure 😊
Your just delightful to watch ❤
LOVEEEEE THESEEEE VIDEOSSSSSS
The shirt, the hair-do, the red lip- just GORGEOUS!
You're glowing!
I smell karenbritchick !!!
Selfie outfit pictures <3
definitely prefer your mirror / selfie outfit shots :)
Casual mirror pics
Piece piece piece piece piece cool  piece piece
Does anyone really just wear what's in 'fashion'? Personally i don't care if something is or trend or not. I wear what i like and feel comfy in. Docs literally never go out of style. I had my first pair aged 8 and am now 34. I have 3 pairs and they're practically all I wear. Screw fashion. Wear whatever you want.
Professionally shot
Always my no.1 fashion guru! X
I love these type of videos! 💕
Enjoyed watching every minute.
Enduro has it's own Claudio...
We love this! Shared: https://www.imbikemag.com/mountain-bike-news/2017/09/course-preview-round-8-ews-finale-ligure-ita-2017/
crazy trails.reminds me of runs in Ocho Rios ,Jamaica
Sam Hill for the WIN!!!
trails look amazing ! just a thought but is the bike industry investing in advancing the wrong technology ? carbon fibre frames ,electronic controled suspension etc etc  .championships won and lost with punctures FFS  \nthe pneumatic tyre was invented in 1843 in scotland using bitumen and sail cloth near dundee .  Its mental that 170 years later \n championships in motor sport and  bike sport are won and lost by loosing air from a tyre !    Thomson was only 23 years old when he patented his pneumatic tyre. He was granted a patent in France in 1846 and in the US in 1847.[2] His tyre consisted of a hollow belt of India-rubber inflated with air so that the wheels presented a cushion of air to the ground, rail or track on which they run. This elastic belt of rubberised canvas was enclosed within a strong outer casing of leather which was bolted to the wheel. Thomson's Aerial Wheels were demonstrated in London's Regent's Park in March 1847 and were fitted to several horse-drawn carriages, greatly improving the comfort of travel and reducing noise. One set ran for 1200 miles without sign of deterioration.
Riders gonna go reaall fast on these trails. Lotsa rocks and flow.
I have such a hard on for racing, cus its viable to the industry, and thats all that maters
Doing an EWS course preview on an e-bike..that's just wrong on so many levels\n\nGreat trails tho
he rode the e bike like he nicked it.some right views all the best to racers
great! thank you!
awesome.
Awesome, can't wait.
sick!
The Italian guy's awesome!
looks a lot like the local trails we have here in Hong Kong ... COOL !!
I don't get it why do you upload some here and others in the EWS channel? Such a mess this year.
E bike........gross
This is adorable Zoe and the little mermaid and seahorse are so cute. Beautiful cake. Tfs 🤗👍🏻😊👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Everything you do is so original Zoe. That's what I love most about your channel. Keep going. Counting down to your shop opening. So excited for you. Wish you infinite success. Love ya.
Brilliant very pretty
Thanks for the idea. It's lovely, quite easy to follow and I'm sure will take me ages 😄 x
Can you do a corset cake? This is amazing..
So pretty! ❤️
That’s brilliant Zoe! You always make it look so much more simple than it is. How many coffee slices would this cake serve?
How beautiful, just love it! How would you transport this three tiered cake to the venue?
Beautiful as always!
Awesome! Can you make an anime inspired cake pls? Like Inuyasha or Ichigo?
Maravilhoso
Awesome job again Zoe! Thanks for sharing. x
wow cake sweet
Would love to see you make a shark cake!
Can you plz make a slugterra cake topper because your method is very clear and I love your videos and I wanted to make a slugterra themed cake for my little brothers birthday cake! Thank you so much
Wow amazing as always you made it look so easy your so talented 😀💁🏻
Such a cute cake! I love your tutorials! Thanks for taking the time to teach us!
So so pretty 😍😍 .. Thanks for sharing
Amazing, this is such a cute cake,x
This cake is beautiful as are all of your works. If you take requests or ideas could you do characters from a cartoon called Kate and Mim-mim? There are 6 main characters, Kate, Mim-mim, Tac, Gobble, Lily, and Boomer. I think they are adorable and the colors of the land they live in, Mimaloo, are so vibrant. I think you could do an amazing job with these characters.
Y are the best cake designer .. love you from Iraqi ❤
Beautiful  job!
Beautiful as always
Awesome video
can u plz do a wolfcake
Nicely done, Zoe! I like the textured sides made to look like waves. Those little details (and the overall artistic ability) really separates a grocery store cake vs your creations.
perfeito
much puppy
Fantastic!!!!
Молодец!
Che amore !!!!!!! 😍😍😍😍
Awesome tutorial Zoe! This is so cute! 😋
Love your work!!
Just loved it
Can you make a boss baby cake ?? 😊
Now, I know it takes you more than 5 minutes to pull these things together, but you make it look so easy!  I love your designs, and this one is no exception!  <3
You are Awesome!
As always, it looks soooo amazing.
Truly amazing!
WOW! perfect cake!
We want real mermaid cake like areil
Lovely
Wow  beutifull wow exelente
Amazing as usual and I love that you cater for all levels of skills
That seahorse is so adorable! Zoey I've been with you for a long time now and yet you continue to amaze me with your talent, keep it up! 🙂
Hi, Zoe. Your mermaid cake looks beautiful, just like you. Thanks again for another lovely cake.
Yeh I'm the first
Play Christensen regularly he's our next great center back.
Batshuayi is brilliant but Morata is better, well done Chelsea for beating Atletico Madrid in their new stadium it was magic so very happy 😊
If Batshuayi worked on his movement, he could compete with Morata as his finishing is just as good. Morata's movement is on another level though.
Every week I watch these videos William is always doing skills, does he even concentrate on actual football
Willian should definitely start his YouTube channel side by side similar to F2 Freestylers...
Play Musonda more
Victor Moses can speak
Please play Kenedy and musonda more
David Luiz 😂😂 0:11
COME ON CHELSEA 🔵💙
Well done boys! Lets beat city 💪💪
Play musonda ..it will be fun seeing delph chase him for 10 or so mins
Willian should practise passing and not those stupid skills
Batshuyai is a great striker. We should play him more often. He got potential.
Willian should be behind Musonda in the squad has any one noticed Willian gives the ball up after Chelsea push forward all time with him in attack he passes or shows of to much and looses possession no disrespect his a great player but we’ve got better and his wasting to many chances in such critical games
Aguero got in a car accident
Michy is still young n has plenty of room to improve his football at chelsea fc. He will soon become a star at the club.
People bashing on Willian are total idiots. They guy is amazing and he can practice the skills if he wants.. Yes, sometimes he does silly things. Don't attack him. Every player does mistakes.
Chelsea squad 11 12 =< Chelsea squad now\n\nAre they gonna win ucl
*MORATA >>>>>>>>>>> Aguero*
Chelsea❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Willian should create a YouTube Football Freestyle Channel because that's all he's about these days & leave football for men, smh
today tactically technically Conte he got it wrong
Yo moses's english is on point didnt expect tht
Who's ready to for FIFA 18 today and Wreck teams with Chelsea FC!?
Show more of hazard in training
only 2 days preparation for the city game is a joke!!! but i believe in the boys to get the win. #COYB💙💙
Does anyone know what sneakers Morata is wearing? The white ones? Looks like Addidas
4:17\nwhy two pairs for the match? does he change them at half-time?
Mitchy is too fat! Get some fat loss diet & exercise!
This channel needs more content same thing every week\n We need more in depth look. Also longer footage
Let's pick up where we left off boys!
Cahill well played on Wednesday. You deserve more credit sometimes
Some of ya'll so disrespectful, Willian has carried the team by himself so many times when they other players are under performing. The most consistent player in our shirt for the pass 5years. #FakeFans 😡
The Wanda Metropolitano is no joke, that is one fresh, footballing arena!
Bats has to rethink his bags lol
Michy doesn't know how to play with his strengths. Otherwise he would have been a good player. Atm he is just average.
We deserved more goals but well played chelsea. Our dominance in the game was crazy.\n#ktbffh\n#coyb
Been noticing Batshuayi wearing old F50 boots why is that ?
Все равно Батшуаи деревянный!!!))))
Come on boys, same ting as last years let’s sweep City under the rug.
Willian works very hard
lovely
Batshuayi = training legend
Boys lets focus city game
Williann ...... 🙄🙄🙄
Chelsea 💙💙
Esse David Luiz 😂😂😂
how you doing Chelsea fans
CHEELLLSSEEEAAAAAA
Morata or lukaku?
Batschuayi on wednesday night made me happy for the first time in UEFA champions league since 2012
IF YOU SUPORT CHELSEA COMMENT UNDER THIS CHELSEA ARE THE BEST
Breaking News Aguero got in a car accident and is out for two months. He won't be playing against Chelsea. 😫😫😫😭😭😭
Michy on fire🔥
Sou brasileiro, mais amo o Chelsea desde pequeno.\nVamos, vamos Chelsea  blue
willian should improve in playing always concentrates on dribbling
I love the fact they are training at the stadium. Very shrewd move by Conte. All teams should be doing this to make their home stadium a fortress.
Morata, Pedro and Alonso are besties
Goodbye zuma
HAZARD <> MORATA <> MUSONDA
I cant believe this video has over half a million views\nGUYS ITS JUST GUS IN UNDERWEAR THROWING STONES AROUND W T F
I contributed to the Kickstarter for this video and I feel I got ripped off
What is he doing\nAnd no way is he human
I love this video more than words can describe

Johnny Cash's Hurt should be the music behind this masterpiece
You may not like it but this is what peak performance looks like
This is the type of high quality content I've come to expect from this channel
What a Slav Squat at 1:13! Absolute perfection in male physique must be required to hold such an amazing position!
Why in the actual fuck am i watching this at 3 AM
You are inspiring me to play Rust again lmao
I can't fucking breath. This is surely a prime example of Cro-Magnon Man. Can you do your next video on the Mousterian Bowl and it's many uses?
Why does the monkier always get more attention than the monkey?
How come all the rocks are different sizes ?
I have no idea how you did this without laughing.
National Geographic has really gone downhill
Did he really just stole a rock from anothers house
well that's one way to get your rocks off
omg watch out for the kitty! stupidest shit ive ever seen thats a favorite.
You'd think he just wanted to run around in his underwear throwing rocks lol
This was great Gus! you even did the closed captions!
I was very reminded of John Cleese in some MP.
The subtitle really provide an insight into the video
Now we millennials can afford houses with our own yards.
filmed with a rock
I love how the sidebar is filled with Primitive Technology videos
Variety headline: Johnson acting debut  a rocky performance.
Boy, I cant wait until he will invent stick!
Gus wears undies like a badge of honor. I'm so proud of you.
There is something artistic about this.
Arsenal London training before each game

You've gotten on the front page of Reddit I think, but I did have to scroll down pretty far.
i was wondering why i didn't see him in season 3 of narcos
This is the most glorious video ever made!
Please tell me you actually filmed this is a strangers yard.
This makes me want to get out and enjoy nature.
This was so fucking funny
the fuck is wrong with this person
Someone's been playing Rust recently...
Turn the subtitles on, if you didn't understand the video. Thank me later.

Dang the new rust update is looking great
I liked the part where he threw the rock.
watched this vid with my dad
Somebody needs to learn how to hold a camera steady.
I mean, what else is there to do at Stout?
Good work on the video, friend. I wish the description box had an elaborate description of what's going on in the video so I wouldn't be confused as to what's happening in this episode of primitive technology. Love your blog!
Is this the new graphics update for Rust?
Nice dad bod.
Why are my pants tighter
Rust
HEY!
Is this rust IRL
Is it primitive porn?
Sweet dad bod.
This is art.

LOOKS LIKE TITANS RUNNING AROUND
Hey
Rust Anyone?
Love you Fleur! It was you that I started watching YouTube because of. Hope you're feeling well xxx
The lighting on this video is a dream. You look gorgeous, pregnancy suits you. <3
Totally impressive. ^.^
Ooh what nail polish are you wearing??
I enjoy your videos SO MUCH😍
Love this! Would totally recommend the new Clarins cushion foundation too! The perfect finish, buildable coverage (big deal for something with problem skin like me!) and just feels beautiful on the skin! x
thumbs up hun 🤗 x
Great products! I'm definitely going to try the concealer and the hair spray. Thanks a lot :)P. S. You look absolutely amazing as always.
<3
I love your makeup look it's so simple and your eyes go really well with that lip colourrrr
Keep well.  Thanks for the video.
I'm just excited for the new in October video:DD
Will you ever come to Slovenia? 😊
Perfect timing for the train journey home! That Estee BB cushion is on my list!! Xx
That brown eyeliner really makes your green eyes stand out. So gorgeous!
Which of the Elizabeth & James fragrances do you not like? Besides the French Grey....I find that you and I have similar taste in fragrance.... I haven't tried the amethyst one yet.... but I LOVE Bourbon
What about your sweater? 😊
Can you do an Hourglass review? Top 5 Bottom 5? I’m soooo curious about the Hyalauronic Foundation!!
You look lovely Fleur❤️
Nice nails
That perfume bottle was cute
Some great favs! xxx
Yay! I love favourites videos <3 :)
Fleur you're so gorgeous in every video 💕
What shampoo and conditioner do you usually use on your hair?xx
So kind of disappointed because I love French Grey from Elizabeth and Jame, and I don't think you really gave it a chance. The scent smells different when you first spray it, it's a bit harsh, but 30 minutes into it it smells so much better, and delicious. But love your videos, and enjoy seeing your videos.
I went to purchase the concealer but confused by the colours. Have you seen the other 2 lighter colours Fleur? I usually have the lightest shade in concealers, as I'm very fair but on Really Rees review the swatches came up looking really pink for 1, and really orange for 2. Your one at no 3 looks really light and more natural looking, is it at all orangey? Kate x
Hi.   Love, love love your video’s, and pregnancy updates, can u tell me what u use to curl your hair.   Thanks.  😘😘
Tell me, please, what firm and where did you buy your earrings? look very nice) Thank you for the video!))
Thanks for the reviews!  Love your nail color!  What is it?  PS, if you haven't tried Burberry Brit Rhythm fragrance, please do!  It is beautiful...im on my 3rd bottle and get compliments all the time.  😊
What nail polish are you wearing? It's beautiful! 😍
Please YouTube. Is there any way in heaven or hell that Fleur de Force does not appear on my trending list. I cannot stand her.
Having a Fleur binge tonight and the pregnancy videos are actually making me broody!! Love you so much Fleur!!😍😘
I love your channel it’s been my absolute favourite for years 😍 have you tried any of the Zoeva eye shadow pallets, I always hear so many good things about the brushes but nothing about their makeup and I would love to know!
I really enjoy how Fleur talks about products, it's very honest and light :)
Amazing! love the video!!
Hi Fleur!  Can you tell me which are the two scents you dont love as much from Elizabeth & James?  I've only ever tried the white one and love it, so curious about the rest..
Loved the video Fleur! Your makeup looked beautiful! What color is the By Terry lipstick? Was number 28 pecan nude the correct color? I just wanted to double check because it looked a lot darker on the website and not mauve (but it could be the online pictures). Thanks!
I'm fairly new to your videos and am absolutely loving them! You mentioned that you usually have some go-to drugstore concealers ...and chance of a video about your fave drugstore products? ❤️💋💞
I just saw your episode on all4 where you are cooking lasagna 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
I love the packaging on the Sam McKnight hair care, very expensive and elegent looking.
the lighting in this video is superb and it only augments your beauty, mademoiselle.
Are all the Estée Lauder eyeliners that good or just the Victoria Beckham ones???
Oooo I wanna try the new Elizabeth and James Perfume , I have two but I can't get it anywhere near me :-(
Loving your nail polish, what is it?? ☺️
Love this video Fleur! Does anyone happen to know when the Estée Lauder BB Cushion will be available in Canada? Or if it's called something else here?
thyanks for thoughts on the new Elizabeth and James launches.  Nirvana Rose is still my firm favorite, but the whole line is incredible.  It was nice to hear your thoughts on the new ones.
I need to know what this lip color is!
Your nail polish ! 🙌🏼 what is it???
I'm surprised you liked the Estée Lauder Double Wear BB Cushion: I'm opposite on the skin- type spectrum to you- I am very oily. I've never liked the EL Double Wear, because it tends to look heavy. I find the same with the BB Cushion. Maybe I'm using it wrong. It's difficult to spread and feels drying even though I'm oily....although Instill get oily. I really want to like it. The shade range irritates me: in the UK, the lightest warm shade that can be purchased (or that seems to be in stock) is W2W. Which is like an NC25 at least; so I had to purchase from the US and have the shade lighter W1W, sent over....which is still a hair too dark for my NC15 skin tone.
You looks so pretty as always thanks babe
Love this. So excited for mini de force! Thank you for inspiring me to upload my first video X
Estee Lauder is always wonderful! I love their products ❤️✨
Hello Fleur, your reviews are immensely helpful for the beauty/youtube world. You are gorgeous and I've loved your channel for a while. xo
❤️❤️❤️ you're so sweet and so pretty!   I'm obsessed with creamy smooth eyeliners. It's so much easier to glide on
Need to check some of these out
I knew the cushion foundation would make it in your favourites, I really want to try it xx
By Terry has been on my list for ages but I can never justify the purchase when there are less expensive items I like...Though, I'm sure I'd love whatever I got and never look back!
7 favs and I want to buy 4 of them now...Well 5 but I am not paying for the VB eyeliner as I think that range is overpriced, but everyone is saying how nice the eyeliner is.... Evo is an Australian brand so nice to see that mentioned!
Fleur, what Shadow are you wearing here? Also, could you share your thoughts on the new Charlotte Tillbury pallet? It looks gorgeous but I'm undecided if it's worth the cost.... thanks!
Please do a video about your ear piercings!  They are so pretty!  What jewelry brands to you love?  Thanks!
love that elizabeth & james perfume! great video! xo from my channel to your’s <3
I also love elizabeth and james perfume but it winds up trending too sweet on me.  That eyeliner looks like a dream <3
You should try some of the Korean cushion foundations (Laneige, Hera, Missha). They have medium to high coverage and still gives out a very natural finish and feeling on your skin. And color range wise, they are seriously fair/pale! Thanks for the recommendations, hopefully I'll be able to find this styling spray in Switzerland! We have Batiste, it's already a good thing!\nI legit cannot wait for the little princess to come! 😍 Sending lots of love to you and your lovely family!
You are so lovely and down-to-earth 😍 Pregnancy really suits you. Love from Finland 🇫🇮
You're so beautiful Fleur! x
Short and sweet are my ❤️
I love your earrings Fleur! Where did you get them? Can I find them online? I would really appreciate it if you could answer me :)
Yours are the only favourites video I watch, love them! What are you wearing through your brows? They look more defined yet softer if that even makes sense ..?
Hi Fleur! What lip color are you wearing??
Hi fleur love your monthly favourites videos.would love to try the purfume.as always you look fab.xx😀
Literally cannot remember the last time I filmed a faves. You look great Fleur xxx
Your makeup always looks incredible!!! 😍👌🏻 As do your nails! You always have the prettiest colors on!!
I really really love this British accent, I want to speak like this, but I caaan't it's don't matching with my mouth 😂😩
Love that scent! Smells a lot like another favorite of mine, Aerin's Amber Musk (which I think I pick up after you recommended it in a video??)
Also obsessed with the new Perfume from E&J it is smokey perfection
No matter where I am, I always feel at home when watching Fleur's videos 💕
I love your sweater! =)
Evo do the best blonde toning conditioner - I find that most purple/silver shampoos are a bit drying, but the conditioner is amazing and tones more than any shampoo I've tried!
You look absolutely beautiful dahhhling!
Perfect lip color 🔥
Hi Fleur, will you be going vlogtober or vlogmas at all this year? Just curious I love your videos 😊
EVO styling products are amazing! The salon I work at was one of the first to carry the Australian based line, and they knock it out of the park with styling and masks!
Aww Fleur you are absolutely beaming , thanks for another great monthly vid. I can't wait till your little one comes along sooooo exciting & there is a real baby boom on YouTube 😘💜✨😘
The sultry eye look suits you so well, beautiful ❤
your make up is beautiful :)
I'm seriously thinking about trying that cushion if they make a shade light enough for me. Hope you are feeling well. Hugs, Summer xo
I found E&J fragrances in Fenwick as well.
I absolutely love these videos! Although I'm sure I say that about all videos you make😂 love you lots Fleur xxx❤️❤️❤️
👍❤️good favourites & I loved it a lot
Can anyone explain to me what the point of the cushion in the foundation is? Is it just a gimmick or what. I got the L'Oréal one and it's useless.
Who was here before 500views
Just now commenting. But as always STOP WHATEVER YOUR DOING AND WATCH. My most intrigued item on this video is the new Elizabeth and James scent. I definitely didn't care for it too much when I first smelt it but I guess I should give it another try since Fleur recommends it. Love you always.
My YouTube unsubscribed from your channel 🙁🙁🙁 not good YouTube
Need daily vlog...fluer...missing everyone 😍😘😁
What's the point in making the elizabeth and james perfumes exclusive to harrods? So you can only get it if you live in london or visit london? And the only way you can sample them to find out if you even like the scent is to visit the store. That's just bullshit. Who do they think they are? Do they think their product is so special and exclusive that only certain people deserve it? No way I'm buying their perfume now. We're talking about mary kate and ashley here, they need to get their heads out of their arses.
Hi Fleur would you consider doing  a video on your eyebrow routine?  They always good. Thanks.
Whats on ur nails? Have been seeing this a lot on ur videos! Thanks!
The by Terri blush looks lovely, but I can get over the fact that it looks like a nipple in the compact 🤦🏼‍♀️
In general I like your videos, but I really do not like the way you use affiliate links and not marking them as affiliate links. And I find it quite strange that you link to two Estee Lauder products to two different websites instead of just linking to Estee Lauders page, its obvious that its because of rstyle.me. Its so sad, because you do this in every video and it almost feel like youre not being candid to your viewers. I hope you change the way you do the info bar in the future :)
Lessons on farming from people that have never been to a farm
Why the heck are there downvotes on this video?
Really great to see another good video on sustainable and regenerative permaculture practices being promoted!
why alligators freeze ??
do fish have feslings ? Can you pls Emily Elert answer this question pls
Perennial grains is a really smart idea! Especially if after harvest the stubble can be grazed by animals to feed the animals and provide natural fertiliser to the crops ready for the next season's growth
can you make why spinosaurus have a sail on hes back?
Using drones to harvest would allow to have such ecosystems with mixed species. Think about it. To meet today's food demand, harvest requires the use from enormous mowers, driven by farmers. The problem with integrating trees, plants and other organisms is that it would difficult mass harvest in the traditional sense. However, the use of drones, together with satellites, gene editing and other techniques could make possible a more efficient agriculture with less impact on the soil and the natural resources such as water and fertilizers. I am sure somebody has thought already about this but I think this is someway how the future agriculture could look like in a not so distant future.
Or we could only eat plants and cut our demand by 7 - 15 times by not feeding 90% of plants to animals. Here's a nice video on the topic /watch?v=Hvdgz536ZLE\n\nIIRC if america alone converted all their crops (not considering better farming practices) we'd have enough to feed 10 billion people. \n\nI would highly suggest MinuteEarth look into the vegan argument for the environment and aiding against world hunger.
I think we just need to invade some shit country and create more living space.
....if you worry about phosporus collect piss. it has plenty, seriously i mean it!\nI get that it brings views when you make videos about the doom is nigh!, but its dishonest, and to me pretty disgusting.\n-1
I've always thought that genetically modifying mushrooms to be more nutritious would be a way to feed the worlds population. They don't need sunlight and the crop turnaround is only 3 days as opposed to 1 to 4 times a year.
What is most wrong about farming is that a lot of people farm grains to feed them to grass eaters. Not only are grains worse food for grass eaters and produce lower quality meat and fat, tending grass pastures and hey fields is actually easier and requires less space than tending equivalent grain fields.
As a professional agriculturist (aka farmer) this video is laughably obvious that it was created by people who read a handful of papers that were written by academics that are more concerned with securing grants and making a name for themselves than developing technologies that will feed the 10 billion people that will be alive by the turn of the next century. Soil and nutrients don't just disappear; perennial grains would be massively more susceptible to disease, and plants need sunlight which trees do a pretty darn good job of blocking. If the other aspects of humanity hold together long enough for the global population to reach 20-100 billion, then water and nutrient cycling will need to be improved. Attempting to implant these ideas anytime soon will lead to people starving and going bankrupt.\n\nKind of smells like fear mongering, MP.
what are future human going to do? BIRTH CONTROL
I don't mean to sound dumb or anything, but i really don't care what life on earth will look like in the next hundred years....i mean....I'll be dead.😕
The problem here is the farmers will only do what is cheaper they Will not spend extra money on these healthy ideas
Fascinating video! As someone who grew up on a ranch, I definitely agree that we as a society need to find a more sustainable method of producing food for the world.
Solution: Population control.\n\n2 Children Max per family across the world\n\nAnd extra messures.\nCreate a sytem where volenteers get 1M dollars and can do with the money whatever they please under Medium Security and after a year the person gets executed. I think speding 1M to kill a single person is reasonbale.\n\nHowever if the person can give back the 1M dollars after a year and he does not wish to die. He can live. This is also a risky opportunity for people that dont want to die but dont have the money to start a bussiness.\n\nI personally would take 100k and sign my death papers. But some people may not agree.
perennial corn doesn't exist and harvesting wheat with other plants will be a pain in the ass
We don't have enough space for this kind of low yield hippie farming. The proper solution is to actually get the 21st century rolling. This means hydrogen fusion + thorium fission for unlimited energy, hydroponic farming for crops and lab grown tissue for meat.
take me to the land institute plz! I want to apprentice there!
Ocean sediments, also verticle farming, and don't forget that salt to fresh water. Liberals look at a problem and think we must make it like nature.
There are two other options ..\nControl the population or explore new planets ..\nFirst option seems more easy than the later. ... so let the hunger/hunting game begin. .
western farming was always broken. many eastern and indigenous cultures have already mastered techniques. \ndoing it the best doesn't always mean doing it right. mass farming was a good move in the wrong direction.
What about hydroponics? Vertical farming? Using natural land to make food is fundamentally unsustainable, we need to increase efficiency, drastically reduce resource use and move it all to the cities. It shows a lack of imagination not to attempt to solve this technologically.
That's not how it works though - the matter doesn't go through any chemical change and therefore just gets moved around
Could you please do a video on turtle oil collection for cosmetic issues and the risk it means to sea turtles. It is a very important thing that no one talks about and worries me and should worry everyone.
Aquaponics is kind of like this.
How the hell are you going to harvest something without taking out everything else beside it?
Easier said than done.
Three Reichs? Family?
Hi
:-)
The solution is to grow crops on different parts of the land and give the previous ones some time to replenish themselves.
That's why people in interstellar are starving and running out of food. K.
Future of farming. Indoor vertical farms
The future is not flying cars.\nIt's high tech farming.
Can you really say farming has always been broken when it has allowed the Earth's population to swell into the billions? Think we could have done that as hunter/gatherers? Perhaps it is people that are broken.
Or, less humans.
You forgot to mention the real solution - vertical farming...
why you stop making paper plane tutorial ? start them again
Since doing this would also take up way more space, and we would run out of land to feed our increasing population, the only way to solve this would be mass genocide 90% of all humans, leaving plenty of room to feed us :)
You Stupid woman, we are recycling the crops already. We make seed of the harvestet crop.
I love the pokemon references in almost  every video.
Just realized Alex, Henry, and Peter were siblings
shit like this will never work in china and india or africa, they are starved and poor as shit (most of the farmers are at least) the people who are involved with farming in poor and overpopulated areas simply will not care. they need money and socioeconomic status, they will do anything to get it
More likely we will move away from plant and animal farming altogether in the latter part of this century and start to manufacture all the plant and or animal proteins and nutrients we need directly via molecular manufacturing. I know enormous vats of artificial meat or plant matter sounds gross and dystopian, but climate change is going to start hitting agriculture really hard in a decade or so
Tem legenda Vietnamita
I'm probably gonna get attacked saying this but, vegetarians stop being pussies and eat a steak, there just animals and they'll reproduce. If one cow dies another one will take its place.
There is a basic arithmetic issue that nobody will address because it hurts feelings. Perenial grains and such are cool and all but permaculture simply cannot sustain the current population, their is a basic limit to the rates of the nitrogen and phosphorous cycles. Resources are being depleted simply because the current population is not sustainable and we require maximum production per acre. The earth has about 5 billion people more than can be maintained at the current first world standard of living, we only get away with this level in the short term by using up our long term savings.\nOn top of that there are major process engineering issues around mixed crops. Hand labor is not compatible with improved living conditions. The ability to batch process provides a major means of controlling diseases and pests in a field. \nMaybe when it finally becomes acceptable to acknowledge that not all opinions are valid or deserving of respect society can make some progress. It will likely be a day late and a dollar short however. Simply put not all people should have the right to have kids, and being anti-birth control is logically equal to advocating for children to starve to death in a few generations. Now there are fools that think they will end resource scarcity via various methods, yet even at that fanciful extreme end(and ignoring the limit of light speed) it would only be 8000 years at the current pop growth rate before every particle in the current observable universe is part of a human body.
MinuteEarth i would love to know how you get your info
Never before? Okay, maybe not on a large scale like you said, but I can't be the only one whose elementary school taught them about Native farming techniques that replenished nutrients in the soil. The Three Sisters was a proven farming technique that Europeans destroyed when they came to America.
PERMACULTURE, guys, why aren't you talking about that? I don't get it.
If we eat less meat we'll have to grow less soy/grain to feed farm animals. No-one wants to give up burgers though :(
Next 10,000 years !?  It would be a miracle to get another 1000.
While this is a legitimate concern and possible problem, I don't see that it's an urgent problem, as long as we let the market help us decide which farming and food production systems are more valuable and worthwhile to us.  \n\nI see some commenters saying big Agricultural businesses won't allow more sustainable processes to be used.  But this is why we need to allow the market to work and not let government intervention limit competition.  Ultimately, it's the consumers who decide what is most produced and with more competition, consumers have more say in the production process.  \n\nFor example, you don't like GMO crops?  Fine.  Let's label them, and then we'll see quantifiable evidence that tells us how much the public is actually concerned about GMO's, instead of listening to special interest groups making political statements. Who knows, the results might surprise me as well as you.
farming is not broken it's the population sustainability.
Genius
Humanitys going to die. Im glad tho.
Wait, this doesn't feel right...\n\nOf course! It's MinuteEarth.\nI thought it was a MinutePhysics video.
And how about combine harvesters having to harvest 1 type of plant at a time when more plants are in the same square foot?
Farmers used to leave 1/3 of the farmland fallow so that it could replenish the nutrients. Perennials would just sap all of those nutrient! Genetic engineering isn't going to erase the average plant's need for essential nutrients and minerals.
We'd just have to slash and burn every remaining forest and replace them with our own balanced ecosystem to feed half the world
The problem is with human and not Earth or farming. South Asia and Africa will add 3 billion people by 2050
Your voice is putting me on edge
Farms are not working out well in recent years because we stopped puting animal shit in them. And that breaks the cycle.
In a few hundred years, humanity will be dead from climate change, so who gives a shit about fucking farming. \nSo pig out motherfuckers and burn this fucking planet into the ground, fucking filthy bastards.
what about fogponics?\nThe idea is that you mist nutrient water into plant roots, which is way more efficient than hydroponics.
Easy, get a replicator, or just go down to Quarks.
That space will not be a good ecosystem. Let's farm stuff underground by pumping sucrose into genetically engineered plants  and use the above ground space for mostly nature and humans.
The invention of agriculture was a mistake.
none of this is true I live in the farming capital of america if youve eaten lettuce in america it came from Yuma az. farming is ahead of the game, this is all horse shit. Stupid propaganda,
Food forests 👍🏻\nFruit is the best thing to eat anyway ;)   Good fruit :)
Hi minute earth, this reminded me of a farming technique called aquaponics, which uses 95% less water than conventional farming. It would be really cool I'd you guys did a video on that
Harvesting would be made incredibly difficult, thus lowering yields and raising costs. Its nice to be idyllic but we need the money in order to achieve that. Another thing we need to worry about is that those lower yields would impact the poorest the most. In the end we would simply need more land, more effort, and higher costs for the same result. We just aren't forward thinking enough as a species to pull that off.
Earth is still on beta test so give Jesus some break.
The key to more efficient and environmentally-friendly farming is (and always has been) technology.\nThere is a misconception among non-farmers that 'organic' farming has less of an environmental impact, when the opposite is true. The ability to get amazing yields using less land, less equipment, and less diesel is why technology is so important to agriculture, especially sustainable agriculture.\nWhen people rally against safe and proven agricultural technology such as GMO's, they aren't just trying to make agriculture less efficient; they are inadvertently making it harder to feed the world and save the environment.

Let's just become hunter-gatherers again
Jesse Agar from This Place was the guest artist!
why is moon white?why do cat say meow?why are we called humans?why am i asking stupid questions?\nok im done bye
Well, I'll finally achieve my weight loss goal :D .. And die
Hey, look at that, a millennial way of pushing GMO's. Profiteers broke farming.
I was hoping that this video was going to discuss aquaponics. I see a sustainable future there.
all of this has been tried and failed and many died of stavation. what a load of crap. all wishful thinking and no science.
Drug suppliers are pioneers of these techniques
If you do that mixing of natural habitats with plantations some species will begin to take advantage of the huge amount of protein and energy in the human crops and pesticides and other undesirable methods will have to be used. I think it is a stupid idea. The only possible approach to all these problems is to reduce the global human population to acceptable levels, especially in China, India and Africa.
Did you try restarting farm ?

uhh..ok
Permaculture
This is why veganism is bad.
Permaculture. Problem fixed.
go ahead, MinuteBollocks, recycle your resources - EAT SHIT!\n*eating this shit video doesnt count.

America alone produces enough grain to feed 10 billion people, but most of it is fed to farm animals instead and nearly half of the remaining food is wasted in other ways. People are starving to death right now because you choose to eat meat, wasting all that grain
MAC sumptuous olive xx

sumptuous olive by MAC!
Just realized we share our birthday! Happy belated one, hope you had a fun day, as i did mine :)
LOVEEE that color on your eyes!! and happy birthday!!
Mark is the sweetest!
A really good khaki green/grey shimmery eyeshadow is Dior's millennium. It's a bizarre putty-type consistency but works really well on its own or layered for a glossy look.
Max Factor Golden Nudes palette has a similar looking colour in it
Happy Belated Birthday, Anna!!! I absolutely love your videos and how real & down to earth you are!! You are a joy to watch and I wish I could hang out with you in person!!!! Your eye makeup looks amazing in this video!!!
I bought the DesixKaty Dose of Colours collab and Anna you need it in your life. Id say we are similar in complexions so the lipsticks are just way too nude, but the shadows are fab! Like you said the green shade is just unreal. If you want (no pressure whatsoever because I don'​t know if you'll see this) I did make a quick blog post about the items I got. My images are nowhere near as professional as yours because you are goals :D (https://ceritolemanblog.wordpress.com/2017/09/21/desi-x-katy-and-dose-of-colors-collaboration-review/)
Loved this vlog Anna, Happy belated birthday ! You deserve everything you wish for and more , xx
Happy Birthday.  The minutae of someone else's life often is riveting on a vlog!  And the desserts looked unutterably amazing!  Not for the first time on YouTube I found myself experiencing Gastronomic Envy!
Happy belated Birthday from Germany - Love your videos and recommendations!
You look a bit like Emma Stone 😍
Would love you to do more ethical fashion stuff - it's a real interest of mine and would love to hear about new brands!
Seriously Mark is the sweetest. Bf/husband goals right there ! Happy late birthday
Oh, and obviously happy birthday from a fellow Virgo :)
There is a Maybelline colour tattoo called 102 Fantasy that I have that looks to be the exact same colour as that Charlotte tilbury eyeshadow worth a look maybe!
Happy belated birthday so excited to see you're putting out really personable content this year 😇& a good shout out to Jackie aina is always nice 😂
I use the L'Oreal Eye Paint in Keep on Khaki as a really nice khaki green colour, I'd really recommend it, and it is nice and cheap!
Oh my gosh, TO EVERYONE WHO IS CHECKING THE COMMENT BOX BEFORE WATCHING THIS VIDEO: WATCH IT UNTIL THE END!!!!!!!!!!! 😂\nHappy birthday Anna, it has been such a relaxing chatty vlog, I adored it. X Chiara
Omg! We have the same birthday! I turned 22. I've been meeting so many people with the same birthday lately. Loved watching this. Happy Birthday, Anna! Love what you do.
Wow you're eyelashes look insane! Love the darker eyeshade too. Happy birthday Anna!! x
Virgos unite!   Was there a newsletter for September?  I am dying to see your newsletter!!
Happy birthday love! That eye shadow looks amazing on you, and Mark is right! you two chatting is quality content!
i liked those boots when you showed them the first time, but I absolutely LOVED them!!
Happy Birthday Anna, the ten spot from grammy made my day!
Hey Anna! Happy Birthdaaay! A good dup of the eyeshadow i think is a Sephora eyeshadow in brown diamonds 😁 xxx
You are the loveliest and sweetest people on Earth! Without knowing you I love you you are the best 💖👌😘😉🎁👍
Happy birthday Anna!!!! 💐🎂lovely video, you and Mark are so sweet! 😍hugs from Italy🇮🇪💚
Anna try sumptuous olive from mac as a dupe and tell me what you thing
Anna! I'm curious why you never put eyeshadow on your bottom lash line? Love the eye look though! x
I'm glad you had a happy birthday 🤗
Happy Birthday Anna! I love Mark's face plant at the end 🤣
Happy Birthday, the eyeshadow looks very similar to greensmoke from mac
Literally I'm the same with birthdays! More chilled the better!
Aw, loved this vlog Anna!! And happy birthday too! xx
A youtuber you need to watch is Karima Mckimie! She's so nice and funny
So glad I stayed till the last second!
Happy Birthday! Great blog, thank you. Can't wait for the next newsletter to drop!
We share a birthday! If it was the 27th? I turned 29.... I can't come to terms with that tbh haha
Happy belated birthday Anna hope you had a lovely day
Sleek palette had a dupe! maybe the storm one? &Happy Birthday!
Belated Happy Birthday! Maybe have a look at Clinique Willow Pop as a dupe, it's also in the golden khaki colour range :-)
Anna, I love your positivity!
Happy Birthday Anna! \nI was listening to your 'At home with.. Zoella' podcast and could relate to your chat about viewers not making themselves known... I've been watching your videos for years and love your content but have never commented... So I thought would take the plunge and say Hi! (And I am totally envious of your brows!).. Rose x
Happy Birthday!!!!! I think Olive from MAC might be a nice dupe? Love your channel as well as most of the other blogger’s you mentioned!
Happy belated to a lovely lady...
Nice! And lóve the eye shadow! As for a tip for a dupe for the colour! Urban Decay Liquid Moondust (what a name 😂), shade: Zodiac!

Happy belated birthday Anna! \nThank you for the recipes!!!! Amazing brownies!! The moment you showed them... I was like OMG I need to make this!
Happy belated birthday, Anna. Looks like you had a lovely day. You certainly seemed very cheerful and positive. I enjoyed the vlog!
happy b day! \np.s. you are so sexy with wet hair, have u ever considered trying to go darker or black?
Glad you had a lovely birthday Anna.
Ha ha ... Mark falling at the end was the best ..
24:50 is the best part
You should check out Jamie Lee from mademoiselle, she has a fashionbased blod and youtube \nand who I lately discoverd is Karenbritchick , she is amazing!! :)
Maybe Sumptuous Olive or Greensmoke from Mac is a good dupe? Great video! 👍 Happy Birthday!
a rather good egg \n\ni had quite the laugh reading your blog post today, happy birthday anna!
Happy birthday Anna! I really love how that eyeshadow colour suits you! Have you had a look at the Marc Jacobs Twinkle Pop stick eyeshadows? I saw a video yesterday and the color seems similar (they used Stardust which looks slightly more on the greyish side). I have yet to test it in real life, I will do as soon as I get to a Sephora. In the meantime, if you do test it, let me (well, everybody) know if it's any good. xx
Happy bday Anna. You are so sweet. And my present to you is Daria Androniescou's channel. She's the queen of wardrobe capsules that have loats of personality. You're welcome ;)
I hope you had lovley birthday Anna love your videos and their content. I get that warm feeling whem I get a notification of an upload 😊
Hey Anna! I'd say try MAC Sumptuous Olive or Greensmoke; they're both quite similar to the Charlotte Tilbury shade!
Happy Birthday! You're such a sweet person, I'm glad you had a fabulous birthday! Yes, we need to clone your husband!! What a super cute couple you two are!
This vlog made me so happy x
Happy Birthday week!! You are too cute! That homemade card though:) ❤️
Brilliant video Anna, I'm so glad you had such a lovely birthday.
Happy Belated Birthday! This was a very cute vlog. I told my husband I was hanging with my friend Anna 😜 a girl can dream.
You’re such a humble person to watch and listen to. Love your content.
Happy Birthday!🎈Love your channel and your new newsletter! You deserve all the happiness you can handle.
Are those earrings from & other stories?
HAPPY BIRTHDAY ANNA! Lol i had a dishwasher, but my mom was always so old fashioned so we still had to hand wash dishes! oh how i hated it!
Many happy returns Anna! Loved that eyeshadow on you! I look forward to the next year of great videos! 😃🎂🍾
Happy birthday Anna!!! Very entertaining video 👍🏾
It's my birthday today (woohoo 27!) and I loved watching this, as I love consuming any and all of your content (fangirl, much? yes. MUCH.) But I have to say the bit in this where you mimic your dad around the baby...so freaking cute, reminded me of my parents being around babies, I just had to leave a little love note. <3 <3
Dear Everyone, apologies for the volume of the music. You're right, it IS too loud. That's my bad! I hope you can cope and it doesn't put you off too much because I can't lower it without removing the video and losing all of your lovely comments. So I promise to not do it again next time if you promise to forgive me and watch this video anyway! Xxx
So funny recipe :D and so funny name...flumps! Thanks for sharing this incredible recipe :)
I used to get called Flump at work because my hair was pastel blue, pink and yellow and it looked like a Flump when I braided it! :)
my new favourite non swear that sounds like swear word.\nwhat the flump is that??? i dont give a flump!!!  get the flump out of here!!! haha love it already
Great video,  but I think I'll just stick with buying them ready made ;)
Plz can you do a lemon sherbet recipe
You should totally do merch!!!!!! Imagen it!
You look like Grace vanderwaal all grown up
Nice editing and a really nice recipe! You guys are awesome! X
Great to see how they’re made but there ain’t no way that I’d go through all THAT palaver for some flumps!!!
Flumps is a fun word to say. Flumps lol. Also, I don't really like marshmallow but I kind of want a flump now lol.
that sprinkle wall though 😍😍
Nice Maddie Style top!!👚
Omg it's soooo pretty
Tuck Shops ya! 😊
Jaffa cakes ❤️
I love British accent

I MISSED C&D HQ!!!!

These look amazing on gingerbread houses.
Flumps look so fun!

MashAllah
Hi
Malteases
Are there vegetarian options? Can I use AgarAgar instead?
Love the commes des garçon top
Hey Jemma 😊\nI am from Germany and I looooove baking. Next Spring I am supposed to make my brothers wedding cake. I want to use Fondant but I don't think Ganache tastes good with it and Buttercream is too sweet in my opinion. Is there maybe a cream based on yogurt or something refreshing that I could use as a base? \nThanks for reading 😊⭐😀😚
Hello Friend!! Very good your channel and your video! Congratulations! I wish every success!\nYour culture and language enchant me! When you have time, visit my channel! In the last video, I made Carrot Cake!\nThank you! Success! Hugs.             #dgtudo
You should cover them in chocolate\nIt'll make them more solid and less wobbly when you hold them
Can you please do a milk chocolate ganache recipe
Think I'm gonna go hungry even after lunch 😅
i love it! do you run a store? you have so many candies behind you
Hey Jemma! Could you PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make a Biscotten Torte? It's a great cake that tastes amazing
Where to store the marshmallows to rest for 24 hours ? In the refrigerator or room temperature
Please make cakes based on Indian theme,green tea & red wine please
Love your videos Gemma, u are the best
What type of powdered gelatin is used?
hard candy ribbons like the kind granny had in the glass jar around christmas time
Really pretty, but I don't really understand why you'd want to eat that.  Lol. :)
I just want to make regular marshmallows, can I skip the glucose since I'll melt them?
Maltesers! Maltesers! Maltesers! Maltesers! Maltesers! Maltesers! Maltesers!  :D I've made your marshmallows so many times (including for my sweetie table at me wedding) and they've always turned out great.
I like flumps but that’s a lot of work and I’m lazy😝 cya I’m off to Tesco
Why would you not just buy flumps? Sm better and cost like 5p
Yeah Gemma, the music is a distraction and a bit annoying.  When I watch your videos I want to relax. Your choice of music on this one is a bit fast, perhaps more appropriate for a work out. Love you anyway xx
which company do you get your sprinkles from in the background? or could you recommend somewhere please! thank you :) and loved the video
Jemma you're the best!! These are absolutely adorable <3
if you don't have friends lmao
Where i come from we call them wiggles, aaaannd they’re covered in chocolate!
That marshmallow u ate was so from today or the batch u just made.
I remember twisted coloured marshmallows but never called them flumps...then again I’m from Australia so probz different name
Not as easy as it looks
Hey jemma! I really loooove your videos , I'd like  to know wich Brand are your spatulas and bowls? Please let me know 😊....
This must be a British thing, haha
I loved dots when I was a child. Colorful and so much fun to tear off the paper and eat
that background music is too loud
Loved the vid but the music too loud over your voice.
If your going to learn one candy recipe this is the one to learn. So nice and yummy. Nice video, Love all your videos
And where do I store them, in a paper bag or a plastic one?
@CupcakeJemma I use to have nougat with jube pieces in it. Maybe you can make that for one of your episodes. 😊😊
Cupcake jemma a very very important qns \nIs it possible to over whip butter? And make it spoil or something by making too pale?
Your phone case so pretty 😍
What's your star sign
i love it so much
Can you swap the gelatine for vege - gel?
we call these spekkies in my country!
Love it so much😱❤\nPlease you can do video on mirror cake?
you are so quick bae
I absolutely love your videos. You give me such inspiration for me to get in the kitchen and make some of your recipes. Thank You so much.😀💜
These look so delicious except I can't find powered gelatin anywhere!!! Pls help!
I missed Cadburys Spiral bars. Made great straws to drink chocolate milk with
I use to eat those when I was 2 years old and I don't see them any more and they taste so good they are awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can't wait to see what you're going to do for halloween this year!
Highkey can't wait for all the halloween masterpieces this year😭😭😭😍
I love how the entire table ends up pure white from the icing sugar/corn flour mixture. That's definitely a liberal application! (And makes complete sense, marshmallows just get so sticky.)\n\nAlso, yes, we should all take tea breaks while baking!
In the netherlands that’s called “spekjes “
Sick video can you do a recipe on a classic millionare shortbread thingy😂... Please\nAlso are they worth all the effort
you hsould do a video on popular childhood sweets- maybe fruit winders? i know they could be quite simple but i am really interested to find out
HI JEMMA❤❤ I love your videos so so much!! Lots of love from Mexico 🇲🇽✨🎉 btw can you make some macarons please!😄😍😘
Any one else notice how perfect and equal Jemmas were compared to the other girls (5:19) lol you can tell she's a master!!!
Looks so difficult but fun to do lol \nThanks for your video
Great recipe but the background music was a terrible idea
The music is really off-putting :(
Hi jemma. I tried this reciepe and the smell and taste of gelatin was really overpowering.. it smelt plastic-y and was just strong.  i added heaps of vanilla but that didnt help. Any tips to change that?
Please make something eggless!!
My gran used to make pralines they were so rich and creamy! She would make vanilla ice cream also, every summer 💕
Yeah cos we've all got a 6ft long work counter..
Or just go to Tesco's and buy one for 10p
Where did you get your cell skin?
I have always loved flumps but this is a hard recipe for my hands (I have rheumatoid arthritis) maybe I could find someone to give these a try for me. I had some shop bought ones not too long ago and they were nasty I couldn't eat them they weren't proper flumps.
Ok, first there was the kitchen towel (mega cool) and now the cell phone case 😍 !!! Looks like Johnny cupcakes designed it (correct?). Was this designed specially for you, or is it available in his shops? Love your videos :) all the best from Germany
She swallows quick...... I like her.
Best song off Painted Ruins, though there's not a bad song on the record
this is great but also what
Love grizzly bear version of The Bachelorette starring Aunt Freckle

Is that Busy Phillips?
Love the band, love Busy Phillips, love Aunt Freckle!
MY BEAUTIFUL DEAR AUNT FRECKLE
YAAAAAS FRECKLE! SLAAAAAAAAY
I adore freckle more than anyone could believe
Freckle is the gayest of all gays ever in the history or future of all gays.

Crazy video, Freckle's underwater look is hilarious
Isn't that the girl white chicks?
Freckle is a goddess
YES FRECKLE YES
Ojalá vengan a Colombia 🇨🇴 !!
Hey guys I'm nowhere near as talented as Grizzly Bear, but they're a huge influence on me and it'd mean a lot if you guys could check out some of my songs! For fans of King Krule and Mac DeMarco
Freckle has hit the big time
God I love Busy Phillips
Beautiful !!! <3 <3 <3 Getting blue velvet vibes during piano scene. So lovely and great song.
is that David Blaine?
kim will always be a bad banana.
You guys see Ed Droste in this video?
What.\n\n\nI need context.
Come through, Freckle! You're a pizza/star! <3
Ed + Frecks. <3 And the girl from White Chicks who is throwing up while that girl holds her hair.
this is My Kind Of Content

Amazing, I really Love this album and the videos 😍😍😍😍💙
best track of the record, looking forward to hearing it performed live :)
I love Aunt Freckle in this
Best song on the album and catchiest tune since Two Weeks. Good Job fellas!
Wow! Great song and video! Is the blonde girl as same as the girl from Yet Again's video?
I believe vídeos are so important and grizzly bear are great on it. This is fucking art!!
Emotive...\nI feel this music. Great album
Twenty-nine people don't have fucking ears and just watched a video with no context. To them. Just them.\nThank you, Ed, Chris T, Chris B, and Daniel!
Love love Busy Phillips, confused by vid but still ❤️
Who came here because of typing 'bear'?
Video compliments the song very VERY well! Also one of my favorites of the album. Can we get a Glass Hillside video?
How not to love their songs?
Fucking brilliant everything!

Aunt freckle looking amazing 😍
Here for AuntFreckle 😍😍
it's neal gamby's hoor ex-wife!
Conceited comment: I prefer the strange vague (almost genderless) sexuality of Knife and Ready, Able to the new music videos. I thought the gender themes on Mourning Sound and (to a lesser extent) on this video were a bit overt, and not particularly insightful. That being said, I did enjoy this video's visual twists, and I'm pretty happy that Grizzly Bear are still in the absurd music-video game.
Wait what what what what what what what  what what what what what what what  what what what what what what what  what what what what what what what
First off please no one attack me because I am one of the biggest Grizzly Bear fans you could ever meet. \n....\nI don't understand these videos. They used to be psychedelic. I always considered grizzly bear to be psychedelic. Ready,Able is the coolest video I have ever watched whilst under the influences \n  This feels pushy. Don't get me wrong, I am absolutely in no way against anything gay. I'm starting to feel like this whole album is about accepting people for what they are. And I do! But damn I miss the Veckatimist feels.
Such a Beatlesque sound
Are they all trans women ??? Yes beautiful yes
Why am I crying in the club right now
It sounds so much like a Father John Misty song that it could be a Father John Misty song
Is this video related to the death of hugh hefner? Both are a symbol of redefining the role of women into society. It would be nice!
Couldn't understand a thing, it's freaking amazing!
Holy shit.
BUTT FUCKERS, FUCKING FOUL.......
This album is a modern classic.
TFW you realise the singer in the clip is a guy 🤔
mmm I was drawn by the title. Thought it'd be a fashion video but it is more about makeup. Anyhow your outfit is cute!
What didn't you put an AD disclaimer in the title? You're required to do that.
If you were on a TV commercial literally doing the same video I doubt anyone would hate on it. Honestly what's the difference between that and this? Silly folks. Cool video, loved the outfits. Tried to recreate the grungy eye...total YouTube fail for me, (I'm a Pinterest fail professional) but I'll keep trying. :) Cheers from Detroit.
Loved the outfit really
A relaxed look loved it. Something I could pull off.  A little green around the eyes is captivating : ) xo\n\nNatoya
Green eyeliner looks lovely on you!
Lily I love you. Your videos and content are so real and genuine and I really enjoy watching them. I hope you're feeling a little better but hey, its okay not to be okay. \nLots of love!
Oh, that's a good trick how to do soft waves, Lily! Thank you! I plan to try it soon.
Oh wow, so interesting that doing mascara relaxes you; I find it anything BUT relaxing, lol! I find it stressful cos of my OCD maybe, so I try to get it as perfect as possible and i always end up getting some on my eyelid. Hence, I hardly wear mascara haha. Loved the entire look, Lily! XxxX.
I love your video. I seem real And reproductive to me. Kiss from France Lily 😍
Gorgeous look! I love fall!!!
I love that mascara, it’s a tubing one, and is better than the blinc one.
I really don't get why people get so sensitive about ads... ANYWAYS, this was a lovely video Lily, keep up the good work xx
The eye makeup on you looks gorgeous!!!! I am so ready for fall as well!! My favorite season!!!
I loved your outfit! I absolutely love Weekday atm so many great bits plus it’s sold on ASOS 🙌🏻
Really nice outfit and you suit the skirt!
Your legs look amazing in those boots!! Xx
You look happier lily, hope you are well!
You forgot to use the green on your waterline while doing the second eye 🙈 loved the look anyway 😊
Love the outfit!!
Loved the eye look 🌹 Your outfit was great too 👌
Thanks for a great beauty vlog Lily - so many bloggers have moved to fashion and forgotten the importance of beauty tutorials and reviews x
Your hair looks amazing at the moment, would love to know if you have changed your routine/products. 😍
Outfit on point !
That skirt is gorgeous 😍
Love this look!
Great video!
Love everything about this look! And I also always forget how much I love wearing green eyeliner. Can't wait to pick one up again.
I really loved this video! It would be so interesting for curly and frizzy hair girls like me to see a hair routine of yours...what products you use, how you straighten your hair, how you manage it, etc. That would be just brilliant.
love this whole look!!! your hair always looks amaze & I want to try that mascara!!!
I love how we could tell you are actually excited about everything you showed in this video, you were smiling so much specially in the outfit part :) btw your nails are so cool!
Love the outfit! I've been looking to get a similar skirt!
Such a wonderful video!  Love the makeup, outfit and hair :):)
You look stunning 💕 love you with this hair length, perhaps even more so with it even longer! 💇🏻
Wish there was a far away view of the whole outfit!
Lily I just love your base, it's flawless....how did you do it? You've probably spoken about it a lot of times but I just watch all your vids and Except for the NY get ready with Anna I haven't seen a make up tutorial in a while! so I was wondering if you can tell us what you've used (foundation, concealer....) you looked gorgeous btw, I love the grungy look 😊
I love everything about this.  I totally forgot all about green eyeliner, it's the only eyeliner I actually feel good in as black can be a bit harsh on me.  Your hair is so lovely, I really wish I could pull off the middle parting as good as you do, and the outfit is very different for you.  I feel like we have a similiar sense of style so I am going to have to check out that mint jumper.  Really great video Lily,  really enjoyed watching. Hope you are keeping well :)
I really enjoyed this video!! The make up look was a bit different but without being too wacky and anyone could wear it x
I loved the outfit! the mascara looks great too. xx
You're twisting it towards your face 🙈😂
I loved your make up and the skirt! I'm not sure about the jumper though! I really liked its colour, but I think a more fitted jumper would look better!
I love the outfit Lily. Also, you've inspired me to try to do a version of this eye look. Thanks!
I loved the outfit! Definitely recreating 😍😍
Loved the eye look!
which color is your nailpolish???
I looooved the outfit! Especially the boots. So chic and a little sexy 👌🏼
I think You look Amazing in that look😍👌🏼💖💖💖👋🏼
Great video Lily! I loved the makeup+hair+outfit combo. Just missed an outdoors shot of you modeling the outfit, I think that would have tied up the video nicely.
loving the autumn look Lily x
That brown eyeshadow work perfectly with your roots! This is perfect!
You look amazing in the autumnal colours....and you have great legs. Loving the green eyeliner, too x
Amazing outfit and I really love your hair colour right now 🙌🏻💕
Love this look Lily ! It looks great on you
Wow, I love this look and the make up is 👌🏻 I read alotttt of YouTube comments and I swear people are TOUGH on you. I loved this video and whatever if it's an ad. It didn't feel like product placement...plus it's your job. Keep producing great, approachable looks. Your videos have been stellar lately 👍🏻
The smoked out green feline flick was such a nice idea 😍
Outfit is the bomb! A little  bit sexy at the same time.I love it.xxx
love the outfit very much!!! love from Belgium
Your hair is so beautiful 😍 love the outfit
Loved this video Lily! Definitely think I'll be trying green eyeliner now x
This outfit is amazing! I love how unique the colours and materials were and how it doesn't look like every other autumn outfit on social media. Can't wait to try that eye look too! Amazing video xx
Love the outfit, you look fab!
As you started to put on green eyeliner I was worried it won't look good, but girl, it looks amazing!
I love the outfit! You've really become one of the people I look to for style inspiration :)
Such a lovely video ❤ and Lily you ROCK this look👌
I Ike how you added the green! Such a nice touch and your autumn outfit look was so cute!:)
great video, Lily...love the fall styles! Can you start posting dupes to all of your purchases though? Not all of us can afford $400+ skirts and blouses.... :(
Wth! You look like Rebecca from Eastenders but with a different voice
LOVE that jumper!!!
i loooved the outfit!
Love this look!!!
You look beautiful!!!!
Love the green eyeliner, it really is so beautiful on brown eyes! Ah I almost forgot about the Matte Balms, I used to be so obsessed with them!
You are awesome 😍. Lots of love from Mexico 🇲🇽❤️
Really loving your hair Lily, it looks great. Also that skirt 😍
Love this outfit, you look really pretty on skirts and dresses. \n\nLove your videos! ❤
I loved this lily!! such a great video idea and love your style so much! :) also: I hope you are feeling a bit better! <3
I actually loved the makeup look, it suited you so well! Will definitely try on myself even though where I live it's spring time now.
I looove this makeup look on you. The green liner looks amazing.
Love love love this on you❤️
I loved this video! :) the outfit looks so nice on you..very flattering :) Can't wait for the autumn weather to get here ...\nI really enjoy your videos more and more lately ... especially your vlogs 😊💕
from watching this i've decided that I need that eye look in my life, also your hair looks SOOO nice!! just loved this video!!
You look beautiful! Wear more skirts and boots! Very nice Lily!!
The outfit is aces!! I’m inspired by it x
Omg this outfit is amazing!!! Definitely feel inspired!!!! 😍😍 the eye look is gorgeous as well - nice to see an autumnal look that isn't red and orange 💕
Great video Lily, love the way you did your makeup, hair and styling. The whole video was put together amazing 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼😀
Really need to get my hands on a green liner, there’s a sentence I never thought I’d say. Well write anyway lol. Loving your whole outfit Lily x
i really like the green eyeliner, you look very sexy!
Really liked the outfit on you!!
Love all of this! I'm going to try that mascara, I love a tubing mascara.
I LOVE this outfit! That skirt is so cute, my friend was wearing a very similar one today and she looked stunning
love the boots and your make up is perfect Lily!
ooooh I LOOOVE the outfit it's different for you but so nice! Love it love it love it
Hi Lily, loved the format of this video and your outfit though different for you still reflected your own personal style. I remember watching the vlog when you were on your boot hunt last year and they look lovely on you! ❤️
Those boots!!!!  Love them!
Love this look xx
Another inspiring video! TFS!
Wow! You look fabulous!
That green liner!! love love love
The green eyeliner looks so good on you! Love your autumn style ❤️🍂
Youtube has become very unoriginal these days. Everyone looks the same and wears the same trend- or statement pieces. The Gucci belt, the Gucci Bag, the same cashmere knits...I mean, I like your video, but it won't inspire me. Sorry, I am not trying to be mean, I love youtube and watching you and others doing what you do. But its become so predictable. Autumn Makeup, GRWM, Ads, Fall Faves, WIMB ...

Godson still has the best style though!
Supercell there should be an option to buy another super builder
How do they matchup against each other on builder base?
Now I am hall 7
I want to see someone fall into the moat of the gaming platform...
You can see the constrenation on his face lol

Do another Clash a Rama but about P.E.K.K.A and mini P.E.K.K.A agruing about who's better
I just 3 starred a base with dragons. The dragons were only 4K elixir because of the event, same for the lighting spell. The base that I 3 starred had 1,100,000 elixir!\nThat’s what I call a “Positive elixir Trade”  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Clash of clans is my favourite game.Supercell can you give to me the Mega knight in clash royale
You guys can't attack properly I can 3 star that with ground attack😖😱😱😱😧😨😨
I like it thank for supercell
W king
Alvaro could've 3 starred it.Here's my army for that base- 1 camp archers,2 camps bombers,2 camps giants.
Supercell dont Closed Coc

Dear Clash of clans\n\n     There's a bug inside of the game.In the news says the battle machine can be upgraded to level 15 but I saw in the top players their battle machine was level 20.

Well, I'd start interviewing hair salon owners first...
take a knee NFL
man one of the most ignorant retarted videos i have ever seen..hopefully these two assholes go to prison
If cops shot  them, a big BLM protest will be done for this idiots
What a bunch of dumb asses. Wait till cops find this video and identify you fucktards!
These cunts should've crashed and died, honestly the world's better off without vermin like this adding to the gene pool.
BLM. Then act like it. Pathetic
straight up,ebk alllday psycho perfeckt killasssssssssssss drrrrrrrrrrrr
People.. yeah sure.  And lets ignore their race. From what I've seen, theirs a consistent trend amongst their race for violence and crime. But im the racist for saying that. Fuck this world.
she shot upwards, he shot straight into the houses. come to mexico and sicarios will deal with your ass in less than 24Hrs. Police cant beat that shit.
They are not wearing seatbelts!!
NIGGERS.  It's ALWAYS the NIGGERS isn't it?
I use to hate him but he a ill nigga #salute
He always give good interviews
31:35 realest part of the interview
man Ebro shouldve let him talk about hip hop beef for longer, he started cracking that shit open and Ebro got mad.
he pointed at fifty arm and he got an acute pain there.. which is inside his arm  see thats what white people do to u
Ebro n roswnberg r neurotic n annoying af especially Ebro he a bih. & 50 still the man ...& jay is too
50 cent will always have beef with jay because irv gotti was a main produce of jays classic resonable jay and irv got relationship period
50 getting old, sounding real emotional talking about Hov. Come on bruh. The Gs is watching
Just cuz you talk loud don't mean your right.. Ebro way off 50 putting out hits and at that time hip hop was real anybody can get it respect to that movement
Dayum Laura styles can't take her eyes off 50 she looking at him like a snack haha
Ebro is right! Shit got messy and labels started signing whatever, wherever!
Ebro fucked it up cuz he aint play Ny's artists, now they start playing them boom u got Dave east, A boogie, don q and Young Ma. literally our fore front along wit pro era and maybe asap mob. Goes to show that ebro on some slime nigga shit
Queens get the money!
damn how old is he? does he even age?
50 was too good for Interscope. Dude put out 2 legendary albums GRODT and The Massacre they still owe 50 big time IMO
Great how Fif points out how all these radio guys like Ebro talk S*** about everyone but keep sucking Jay Z balls,Charlemagne does same too
Their is so much politics in this rap shit
To say 50 cent killed NYC Hip-hop is the dumbest statement I've heard from Ebro. NY hip-hop lost its identity and was trying to sound like the South which was already pounding the radio airways. It didn't work. The South took the torch and ran with it. NY artist started riding the coattails of the South.
NY artists tried to blackball 50, and then tried to fuck with him when he got on.
50 put me up on so much game watching this salute
Roseberg says the you know how horrible Trump is? like nobody likes him. These people bullshit someone voted for Trump.
50 is one of the smartest dude I'm still surprised he isn't head of a label or some kind of boss.   But he do whatever he want
He had to get them then he gave us a classic on The Massacre: PIGGY BANK
When is someone gonna slap this shit out of ebro!
50 one of the GOATs
Prodigy and Tupac were very similar. They really art students that took on the theme thugging
50 I'm next good one
thanks 50 for REALLY PULLING Ebro coat! YOU ARE THE BEST!
HANDS DOWN One of the best people in the world.. This negro I dont kno how to not respond to someone trying to hurt me ....So ima start hurting people. Lmao thinking like my uncle ass nigha
what does 50 mean when he says hiphop is a youth culture?
tom ford is my subscribtion
This nigga be saying a whole lot of nothing
Fifty I love you no homo but you always hating on Hov...
he drops gems. one of the best interviewees anyone can watch.
Fiddy is the definition of cool
first time listening to this radio show damn its entertaining , gracias.
Great interview. If you have some time, I have a Rap single that I think can put me into the Industry. If you guys have time, type in Enzo - Count in the search bar and let me know what you think! I appreciate and love all of you!Thumbs up for Hip Hop.
thats where its at gladiator \nor is this just bearly coming out\n  about the deal \n  i fucks wit  fifty\n ,my explicits were in that direction\n  at the begining to em \n nothing against him or the camp\n im just tryna learn it and put the game on clamp\ni just aint wit none of that bs\nmake $ live life make music
Ebro will beat 50 in a fight, 50 only makes records about being gangster but that's as far as his gangster image goes, that's why 50 is a fan of ctg because they both run when they're confronted on the streets
50 one of the only real Niggas left in hip hop
26:50 is where it gets Real
The Game Album, 1. I Am  2.Make a wish 3.take what you want. 4.Real Problems  5.Sleepless and alone 6. Crazy 7.Will he make it 8.Ha ha ha. 9. Hungry 10. Looks Like me Sounds Like me. 11. light another smoke. 12. Stay Stoned 13. Parrinoid And in pain
Watched every 50 cent interview this a brilliant business man much respect big homie
Keep 50 Alive. 50 was the last of hip hop, if you don’t get it. The fact that the industry started looking for OTHER rap after him. Then you see it
Why Ebro look like the defensive coordinator for the New England Patriots?
where is the middle of 50's mustache lmaooo
ok.. what's with the whole NY hiphop destruction ?? did they have a fight long ago ?? what are they talking about? someone ?
Peace in the name of Christ. Important: Can someone get the following short vid in front of Jay Z & his people.. https://youtu.be/pFb0Xu2xJYg
Like a flashback to 03/04 😂
So many underestimate 50s intelligence, he's so aware of everything around him. Just listen to the way he break everything down. Respect bruh
New York as a whole fucking let everybody takeover not fifty
50 is the REALIST nigga in the industry
Ebro just shut the fuck up ..keep blaiming 50 for shit he never did.. It was you Radio DJ,s who stop playing real HIPHop and NY artist music.  50 Just a real Soldier and if its wartime  then ist wartime..but stop blaiming others u Prick.. I see now why Breackfastclub is wining over u suckerz.
why ebro trynna make 50 doing well into some bullshit about race. ffs man, you can tell 50 knows being a black dude doesn't make shit cos he's balling.
50 only dude who can go from nicest guy in hip hop to ready to fuck a guy up in the same interview and I believe he would do it.
I take it that 50 doesn't care for Puffy.
Rules for the NFL     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXK6MVbC-SE&feature=youtu.be
Ebro knows exactly what 50 was implying. It doesn’t matter how you personally gauge a hit a record. The question was simple “Who’s playing it now?” I liked the project but 50 is right this is a youth driven culture and the youth who is the main consumer is not consuming that project.
rosenberg dont ever wear that chain again my nigga looking like a fob pablo miguel diaz
He right about Angie Martinez. That bitch been on Jayzs dick!! I think Jay Z fucked her a few times.
50 smacked the hell out of rosenberg arm at 15:02 lmao
haven't fucked with his music in years but i still like the guy
almost none of this makes any sense at all
50 could have been a Jay Z
Hi bitch i see you reading these comments 😈
Top guy 50🙌🏽✊🏾🤓💰😎🥁
Lmao he is dumb. How do you not get the future line. He's saying he could've  ended up like that very easily and glad it didn't. That Ciara shit is a trash situation for a dude.
STACK BUNDLES was on his WAY! R.I.P. Ray Ray, I love ya my nigga and CHINX Drugz. SQ,SQ,SQ,SQ  SQQUUUAAAADDDDD UP!
50 has always been an entrepreneur. Businessman to the tee
50 the best at interviews.. I learn so much.. 💪😎👍💯💯💯
50 Kool
50 is a smart brotha
50!
whatever get a life posa
Ebro...shut the hell up!
50 cent getting that paper
omaewa no shindeiru
Salute Curtis Jackson aka 50cent
Genius ass businessman right here.
50 cent real youth.big up
Jay-Z ruined NY hiphop when he was president of DefJam...He promoted Rick Ross and Jeezy but shelfed all the NY artists.
Nervous laughter all around lol
70 IQ people gathering...
@ 27:09 shit had me crying
Great interview. 👌
Ebro is so fucking annoying
‘Hoe Culture ‘ I luv it lol
Fuc Ebro bih azz
we need time stamps
It's 50!
IGNORANCE
@ 41:35 why Fifty clap like a seal lmao. Like a slow child
Only for 50!
HOT 97 is trash
Dude gives the best interviews
Did Fif really end NY rap?
Rosenberg iced out now?
Legend
Fif wearing beats
at least ebro gave it back charlamagne licks fiddys ass and stays quiet
Man, I was right there with you guys until you went to #PruneTown. 😂😂😂
I seriously think that Ben's idea of quick and easy means you don't have to grind your own wheat for the flour.
Who the hell thinks destoning apricots is difficult? 😅
OK, random challenge idea. The normal people cook and the chefs judge, but the chef's do not know what the secret ingredient/inspiration is.  This way the normies have to come up with (probably with viewer help) an inspired recipe that they make and the chefs have to figure out what the inspiration was based off the dishes. A  challenge all around.
I love the look on Jamie's face when he gets to do the This is our........sorted!. That's the joy of cooking right there.
Jaimie did the thing Jaimie did the thing!!
Get more views on your video, check out: u2bzone(dot)C O M
This feels like, an ad or something? All the interactions are like, Deglazing whaaaaats thaaaaaat? I kinda wonder if this is them demonstrating how they can be good and commercially
What the fuck, i was watching sneaker videos right 20mins ago, now im on food inspiration for mid life crisis victims lmfao
I knew it. I knew no matter what, Ben wouldn't have given a 10/10. That look on his face though, was priceless.
This looks really good! I'm going to make it next week, and might add some barley in there somewhere. :)
WHERE IS hello, and welcome to fridgecam...?!
6:13 Is it really a technical word or did ben just make that up 😂😂😂😂
Now that's brilliant!
Ben is like the professor I had last semester. You do everything perfectly to the standard they requested, and yet ... A-
**englishly and sadly** you could miss out on double cream altogether
A lot of fucking effort for an effortless meal.
I'm so proud
Jamie - did you find out why you lost 0.5 marks?
Made this tonight with some alterations and it was a huge hit with the boyfriend. Subbed green beans for the spinach (not a fan) and normal white beans for the butterbeans. Took the 'pear' suggestion from Ben to sub the apricots as well, that was great :)
Dear sorted food gents, what is the best recipes for a person who is sick?
HAHAHAHA Did anyone else rewind the beginning with Ben waving behind Jamie because I did a lot.. totally worth it!
I wish Ben wouldn't appear in every video. He's getting annoying.
Please do more like this and do slow cooker stuff too!
You're cheffin' all over the place! *literary 15 seconds later*  you can see how it all just 'mleau' (pronunciation?? XD) back, technical word for wilted xD yeah Ben, you do you xD
Hey guys x love the recipe but do pork medallions cost a lot? I recently started university, could you do some cheap, quick and easy meals for students? One problem I find when cooking is the portion size x I always make too much for one meal! Could you guys help? Love the vids =) Thank you!
I think I'm likely not alone in this: but I love you guys. For real!! Glad to be part of the Kickstarter campaign xo
You don’t need to eat meat it’s ruining the environment and our bodies
Always looking for midweek meals. Midweek is when I work late so these are always appreciated
More of this! Loving it :)
Leviticus 11:7 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.\n\n8 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you.\n\n9 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.\n\n10 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you:\n\n11 They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.\n\n12 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you.
I just got an idea. What if you make a battle in which James and Ben ‘supervise’ the boys where they cook a somewhat complicated meal? You can make pairings like James & Barry and Ben & Jamie or whatever. That’ll be fun to watch!
Lol I've been vegetarian my whole life but surely pig and fruit don't go well together? 😂😂😂
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
look like to much work. Delivery much easier 😃
Hahhaha is the last line + Sorted the chef's right? :P good work boys
Jamie is cute. 😀 he's my fave
4:36 Thank you, Ben. I now know the easiest way to get stoned.
Do more of these!
still can't get behind the whole 'meat+fruit' thing.
I'm allergic to a lot of fruits, many which are stone fruits. What other alternatives could I use? (Apples and pears are not an options either!)
He didn't salt/pepper both sides I think D:
You guys should make poulet-frites. Basically rotisserie chicken with a bed of potato/fries underneath to catch the fat drippings and other deliciousness from the chicken
Don't worry Ben, I can give you the other half an inch.\n\n*sorry, it was sitting out there*
what would be a good substitute for prunes?
Can not believe the amount of 'je ne sais quoi' you shoved in there...
guys if you want to eat healthy and save money delete Food app from your phone
Could we do a student meal week please? like quick and easy meals for one that are also healthy-ish and cheap? :)
Do a segment of different kinds if food from ancient times please!!!
This is great, definitely going to try this out. Would love to see more!
This was great. Can we have more like this? I don't like sweets very much and I feel like there's been sooooo many desserts on this channel lately haha.
Are prunes needed to Chef all over the place?
They are so attractive!!! Single?
How is Jamie still so useless 😂
Make a series called mid-week meals! Seriously need more of such recipes for my own mid-week meals
I still watch most of the videos on this channel, even though I am a very picky eater and find a good 85% of the recipes disgusting. The boys are so entertaining, and even if I don't like a recipe (eg, fruit paired with meat.. NOPE!), I still get ideas from recipes and incorporate them into my own cooking. <3 you guys!
Ben was on fire today!
Amazing, thanks! But can get a super fight with a lot of beautiful men, please. Like have Tom Daley again and his hubby Lance Black and form two teams, like for Halloween!!!!? Because that will be Epic!!!! Please!!!!
need more of these types of vids :D\nnice and easy meals but still gorgeous
I love recipes like this! Is it possible to see some more autumnal recipes that can be slow-cooked? I work most of the day, so I'd love to come home and have something ready and waiting for me!
The missing half a point for full marks was obviously a sprig of mint
Dämn that music, anyone know what the tracks are on this one? <3
Haha The zooming in on the food reminds me of Gordon Ramsey!!\n\n\n\n\nWHERE'S THE LAMB SAAAAAAUAUUAUUAUACE
So easy thumb in the middle Stoned.. Yeahhhhhhhhhhh
This reminded me I've got lamb cutlets in the freezer, excellent.\nWell done Jamie.
3:55 Jamie had the tongs in his left hand but he still used his other hand to put the pork into the pan...\n\n\nI love it XD!
Is anyone going to tell Ben that apples don’t have stones?
You guys should do more mid week meals, love this!
Love the one pan recipes! I'm gonna try this one next week
He looked so happy to be able to say the 'sorted' line, awww! <3 lmao
dried apricots have a different flavor to fresh ones though . . .
Jamie lost some weight, looking good bro 😎👌
More of these, please!! 😘
This is so encouraging to see and holy heck it looks delicious!
James looks so proud at the end 😂😂
More videos like this!! Please:D This looks sooooo good and easy <3
Thanks for the recipe, very interesting you guys!
I'm a vegetarian why am I watching this?
Jamie should have put a sprig of mint on it to get a 10/10
TREAT YO SELF!
That's pork loin not fillet!
Whoa, that looks and sounds amazing!
Amazing!!!
he said simplicity...
That looks AMAZING!
wher frome you hawe guys that big pork filet or that was pork loin
Porking? Was that a Freudian slip, Ben? Lol!
Stoned! 😍
Bens vocabulary: Amazing, hot, gentle, succulent, British
More one pot recipes
Do you guys do any vegetarian meals?
Could I substitute the pork with those big mushrooms and chicken stock with veggie stock to make it vegan?
Running out of inspiration ...??? I don't understand what you're saying. You make thousands of meals in your lifetime. Why would it being the middle of the week make any kind of difference to anything??? I don't understand. ???
Why is it chicken stock is always paired with pork when we normally use matching meat/stocks (ie chicken with chicken stock, beef with beef stock). Is pork stock just not a thing?
I just bought a slow cooker - can you do a week of slow cooker meals please guys? Thanks so much!! :D
Never thought of apricot with pork but it sounds delicious. Too bad it's 11:30pm where I'm at, watching, or I'd cook this right away. I'm not sure my family would appreciate my midnight cooking 😂
Why are there bits of dead animal in your dish 😕?
Hey sorted food names Noah and I am a second year uni student at UWE and my cooking skills are pretty bad.Do you have any student recipies they are easy enough but time effective that anyone could cook them as a tea.Great video wish I could cook this
Unfortunately I can't eat pork (religious reasons). Is there a protein I can substitute in for this meal? I really like the flavors used in here. Beans and fruits etc.

I can see why you married her she's like the female version of you great chemistry
The construction of your pile of nachos was euphoric to watch
I am not vegan, but I eat a lot of Vegan food, and those Nachos were the truth. Would eat those without worrying about meat any day.
I like your recipies, i´d love to try the vegan nacho cheese, on the other hand, i would like you to know some things becuase those are not mexican dishes, those are TEXMEX. We dont use yellow cheese, we dont even eat nachos (as a mexican dish), for us nachos are an American thing, adding beans is also a Mexican stereotype. Pico de Gallo uses Serrano pepper, not Jalapeño, but thats ok. \n\nThe way we eat tortilla chips is just with smashed beans with queso fresco, or in a soup.\n\nMost of the time our quesadillas uses Oaxaca cheese or quesillo, that is white. \n\nThats all, hehe... thanks for posting this video, and being aware of the last eartquake, we apreciate it.
Absolutely love that you guys are making more plant-based dishes on Brothers Green! The vegans and animals are thanking you both 😄
Best. Compilation. Video. EVER. 😍
Looks great my brother 👍 me as a Mexican that looks amazing
Where do you buy your squeeze bottles? This was fantastic!
This is so awesome that you released this today!!! Im releasing my Brothers Green BGBQ vegetarian tacos video today!! YES!!
Why do you put gluten free and vegan together?\nIt's not by choice that we don't eat gluten, we're just super sick when we do.
Daiya cheese is un-naturally flavored 59% saturated fat garbage, the manufacturing facility everyone has to wear hazmat like jumpers, boots, nets, full face respirators. Not for sanitary but for the toxic fumes mixing those flavors. Why and how? Because I live near it, I went to culinary school, I have worked in organic and natural food manufacturing of way to many foods and companies using even organic flavors, Oh man, don't believe any of that crap. You'll never find out, the bosses will even tell you not to sample flavored items that are vegan, teas, to foods or what have you. Sorry but Daiya doesn't sit right in my body or any of my vegan friends in Vancouver. Stick to nutritional cheese or Chao cheese. Ethics and manipulation is a flaw in natural foods. I see foods in stores that are expired and were once moldy and are passed as organic. Even in multi-national or International franchises, to amazon to major grocery chains.\n\nI have yet to meet one ethical and transparent organic company In the west coast of Canada. They are slave owners and like to say everything is organic and have paid off health inspector informants. Shall I retrieve my emails after great concerns and complaints of many employees I have worked with. Never trust any food manufacturer. Unless you see how it is made, we are blind to this yes. But stay as natural as possible, open kitchen restaurants and farm markets. I rather spend more and help smaller folks out then greedy corrupt families or elitist companies only for corrupt greed. The stories I could tell you folks over the last 5 years working with making natural and organic foods.
Love it! More vegan vids!!
This video is amazing, really inspired me to give some effort to make a dinner like this some point in the future when the moment arrives. Love it!
Honestly, gonna probably stick to bought nachos. In these parts an 8-pack of tortillas costs like double a pack of nachos.\nBtw carnivore here, but these look really tasty, might try them.
Help!   Any help confirming what type of non stick pans you and your brother use?  In need of a new decent one.
Am I  missing something? I'm not seeing the actual recipes anywhere? I'm SO glad to see you started a vegan channel!! When I first ran across your videos I thought it was a vegan channel and was sad when I realized it wasn't so this made my day!
I fucks wit it
Love what you guys do! You should do a video about quinoa recipe!
I have a question for Vegans who choose to be so because of their love for animals. Do you hate plants that much that you would rather eat them over animals?
Plz do Vietnamese Mexican video. I need these tastes in my life
Looked amazing!!! Yum
Fuggggggg. YES!
She's awesome
Nachos aren't Mexican god damn it
an amazing wife = an amazing life
YESSSSSSSS
😮😋
Yaaaay vegan stuff !! Big up for that ! <3
Damn, thanks!
Yay! More vegan videos ❤️🌹
Jackie seems like so much fun!! I'm not vegan but I want to try some of these recipes! They remind me of the recipes on Hot For Food's channel
Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!
Josh is going SUPER SAYAN!!!
nice vid. thanks for all the insight and tips. oh, somebody prolly already mentioned this but just in case not... the letter j is pronounced like an h in spanish (like the name José). so the name of the mexican restaurant, Jajaja, is pronounced Hahaha! having said all that (a mouthful), i really don't think authentic mexican fare is all that meat centric. like all traditional cuisines, it should be pretty easy to veganize. (btw, just happened to see this: https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/best-vegan-mexican-restaurant-in-nyc.)
you know what would be good on those nachos.......STEAK!! lol jk love the videos bro!
Red Bell Pepper in Guac is a =Mexican Food cardinal sin.
More vegan videos! Great content <3
Love ur cooking
Love you guys (:
great vlog
Totally awesome video guys! Thank you for making a vegan video! Rock on
why would anyone eat gluten free if you dont have to? I mean vegan or vegeterian does makes sense but gluten free?
I love it when youtubers bring their partners on!!
How about showing some recipes that use garlic confit?\n\nI could take it or leave it with the vegan thing, but I'm sure you can come up with a lot of stuff that uses a great (vegan) source of savory flavor in a creamy package.
where I live, Nacho chips are way cheaper than make your own with tortillas
The Perfect Complement...so delicious...I would love to see an ingredient list? I don't know what I have on hand and what I would need? can I gather it all in 1 week? I think first and foremost I will try NACHOS! Gonna be S.O. G.O.O.D! Great Ideas!!! ; )
My father taught me about Hanuman when I was a small child, Namaste to the two of you.
Your wife is really cool, you guys are great together on camera :)
It's funny to hear people say jajaja with the J when it's hahaha in Spanish lol idk I think it's cute I went there with my boyfriend(I'm vegan he isn't) he and I loved it so much I love mexcain food. The machos were the best.
i would love to know how you make eating work in the home, is there twi meals going around, or do you just eat vegan at home? epic recipe!
can't believe how big your channel has grown!!
Not vegan, but am excited to try the crema and the chips!
Amazing! THANK you for posting this! :) Looks absolutely amazing!
Why does that Jackfruit look like shredded chicken though!!!
Crazy how the cheese sauce still manages to get that bright yellow queso colour
Wtf is wrong with your hair cut?
My kind of video! I am always making Indian and Asian foods. Been needing to open up my arsenal
I love that you reach out to vegan audience with this kind of videos. this shows how much the channel has grown and yeah if you always stick to the same thing it will be boring, right? also I don't have access to daiya here so please make a video on how to make vegan cheese!
I don't know man, I love Juanita chips.
The Mexican corn is actually  put into the grill with the leaves. When the leaves burn turn black you remove them. When you peel them they will be July and a tiny bit burned. Lmk if you try it this way
I also really like your wife, she's just like you it's awesome, love the video too might try a few
You two compliment each other in the most lovely way. Great Friday video!
It’s so sad that corn tortillas are so expensive around here
PARMESAN CHEESE DOES NOT GO ON A STREET CORN
As someone with renal problem, this recipes are very helpful. Subscribed to your new channel.
very interesting and unique ideas ! thank you :)
Wait... if he's gay, what's with the wife? Lol
she is the female version of him. its amazing to watch them 👀
can you put the ingredients in the comments please?
They're plenty of authentic mexican dishes that happen to be vegan also- Check it out.
Thank you so much for including more recipes. I remember when you guys asked me on Twitter if I'd like to see more WFPB or Vegan recipes, this was back when I first transitioned into the Vegan lifestyle. September 2016 I made the switch. Everything has been amazing. Thank you for still providing many amazing recipes. Have a lovely weekend!
great video!!!  ( as always)
LOVE YOU MAN LIKE IF U DO TO!!
Everything looks so fresh and delicious, you guys did a great job! I can't wait to try all of these recipes this weekend :)
This channel is starting to tap into the vegan hell on youtube. It's been an hour and I already see comments lecturing people on why eating meat is morally wrong and that you should be ashamed. Next we will have vegan gains community coming over.
Love it guys!
Married ?
dude YES
I don't know what others think, but seeing the cook actually eating and reacting to what they have prepared is 50% of what I wait for. That tells and sells it all for me! Thanks for another great video, but please, no more censoring the eating! :)
I live for your slo-mo shots!
I'm mexican and I aprove 100%, I love it when people from other countries try to recreate our food. It was also very nice to see you make your own corn tortillas, keep it going guys👍
how long do you think it is safe to keep the cashew sauce in the fridge ? if I make it I will not eat it all in once I think
Hope you're enjoying marriagehood!! I adore you guys!\nI'm excited to use my face to press some homemade tortillas tonight! Lol!
I have had a can of jack fruit for a year, but none of the bbq recipes look good to me.  This one you did looks amazing, it's got the look of what I love.  Thanks!! I subscribed to your new channel nut you are not on my feed, weird.
When I see Jackfruit in the grocery store I'm intimidated by the size of it. I'm single/live by myself, so I don't usually buy stuff like that unless I really like it and will eat it right away or can preserve it by freezing it. Can someone make the Jackfruit meat in this video and store (by freezing) for later use? I saw another video on the munchies YouTube channel where a guy made a BBQ vegan sandwich out of smoked trumpet or king oyster mushrooms. I'm highly intrigued by it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWMIpdhlVZY&t=75s
Fantastic! Thank you
What happened with meat
Thank you so much for posting this video! I have just begun my transition to vegan eating, primarily for health and ecological reasons, so this is perfectly timed for me. I also appreciate that you're mostly using ingredients I can find near me--I live in a very rural area, with a single grocery store in town. If I want more exotic ingredients, I have to drive about 30-45 mins. To give you and idea of how limited our selections can be, we just started having avacados here as a regular item maybe a year ago. :/ I have never seen jackfruit in person, but I will make an effort to check for it the next time I do an out-of-town grocery run. If that fails, there is always The Interwebs. :) Thanks again, and congrats on the new channel!
How long does the vegan cheese and sour cream last in the fridge? Can I freeze either? Would love to make in large batches so I can save time/money
Making my MMA debut next Saturday. My dream is to become world champion. Follow my journey much love
OMG that all looks amazing. Especially the Jackfruit tacos. I am extremely allergic to poultry, eggs, feathers.....the whole nine yards. we are fortunate to live on a farm, so mainly everything comes straight from the Animal or the ground here (with a few exceptions, lol). My husband says we do not do vegan but I so could. I am going to try to trick him with this. Yumm
This is a crime against mexican gastronomy
If there ain’t meat it ain’t Mexican
Thank you for this! Jackie is awesome sauce and I can't wait to make some of this.
Hey where do you guys get permission to use those songs from sound cloud? I'm really tired of the YouTube royalty free tunes. Thanks!
I really do not like Vegan food and straight plant based recipes but, I respect other people's choices! Rad video, as per uge! You guys are awesome together. 😊
Absolutely love this video! Just wanted to add in that Diaya while it is vegan they just switched over and sold out to a company that tests on animals! Just wanted to let you guys know because I know it bothered me when I found out, I didn't know if Jackie is aware of this! But there's so many other vegan cheeses which are even better than Diaya in my opinion like Follow Your Heart and Chao!
The problem here is that vegan food is way too expensive, produce is absurdly priced in most places, especially avocados, and cashews are expensive too. Meat is and always will be cheaper.
I remember the times when the food recipes included some meat. Nothing against vegans, but I didn't think this channel would turn towards vegan foods as often as it does.

That Liverpool badge looks strange
His English is great 👍
Van Dijk may be the only player that gets fifa ratings
wonder why he said Sturridge
He should have a better rating
Haha he had to say Sturridge
When he said: Sturridge, when he's fit 😂
Liverpool fans are annoyed
Im surprised how good his english is
Seems like a nice guy
Sturridge wen his fit JUST COME TO LIVERPOOL VIRGIL VAN DIJK
I would personally like to see you allow the player to write his own stats before he sees what EA gave him. Spice things up a bit.
VVD knows. Fit Studge 🔥🔥
much better than alli and so much humble
If he went liverpool he would have been a 85 for sure
His rating next year will skyrocket once he joins LFC
Van dijk and Keita for us next TW I hope.. Although Keita already signed for 2018 season
Keep the footballers reacting to stats videos coming
Rio talking to a Loserpool player. Errrrr.... error 404!!! 😂😂😂\nRio talking to a Southampton player.*
Should give the player the blank card first to make these videos more interesting
My mans got that 8g Physical.
Van Dijk come to Liverpool in January pleaseee 😭😭😭
he looks like offset from migos LOL
I think Virgil's rating for himself is more deserving than his current rating. Don you think?
He said sturigge and Aguero because he wants to move to LFC and MC
You should give ask them for their predictions first ffs
He wants to go to either Liverpool or city
What a legend Rio Ferdinand is, top man
Lol why does it look like Van Dijk is wearing a Van Dijk mask in the thumbnail 😂
He’s smoking, I’ll burn him
welcome to LFC in January.
He's got to come to Liverpool and save our defense
Just get to Liverpool
His card he wrote in would be worth 500k plus
What a tank in video game and real life
I think there's a mistake on the title he plays for Liverpool not Southampton c'mon get your act together
Big up the fs&hg tune
They don't give high pace to CB's to avoid them from being overpowered, annoying but whatever. Also, Dutch people have excellent English.
He's happy except from the badge on the card
They got the wrong team
Would be the most used defender in the game
Should they put they're ratings in before you show them?
83 is a joke hes at least 87
Sturridge when he's fit... He wants Liverpool so bad... And we want him likewise
The stats are perfect but the passing is meant to be 72 or73
Lower the passing by 10 and pace by 5 he deserves an 84. Quality CB
I'd love to play a game against rio he seems like a sound guy and easy to get past
Rio tell him he will nothing if he moves to liverpook
Looks a little bit like Alli when he's laughing…
Wait those stats are wrong... it says 69 dribbling but he actually has 70 on Fifa 18
What are those cards made of always wondered
He wouldn't have those stats at Liverpool after conceding 50+ goals a year
Very good defender. Sturridge and Aguero do pull defenders away because they're always running at a different velocity. And of course VVD wants a move to either club so can't knock the brotha for saying that.
His english is better than rooney\n\n\n\n\nClassic😂
Actually seems like a sound guy tbf
Hhahaha sturridge <33
Did he say sturridge
Everybody thinks they're better.
2 big beasts
With lukaku
85 passing hahaha his funny
Free van dijk
85 passing cmon mate
❤❤❤

Este canal ya chafeo, solamente hablan del FIFA... ¿cuanto te pagaron los de EA, Rio?
He be a Liverpool player in January
Ferdinand son van dijk is gonna be great
Van Dijk Come to Liverpool
Van dijk should be higher in everything 😂
first
Van dijk is the only CB that can save Liverpool tbh \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen again I love to see Liverpool suffer 😂
How the hell does he have the same physique as Akinfenwa?...dont get me wrong, he is very strong but compared to Akinfenwa? No way..
I think Sturridge is better than Firmino when he isnt injured. Sturridge is actually great at football. But he really never gets play time either. Firmino was good like 1-2 seasons ago. But he havent rly done anything yet.
U didn't show him his bloody FIFA 18 card rio
Would be a good fit at United but put off with this whole liverpool link. Hope he shows a desire for united n something can happen. Always saw him as a perfect rio replacememt and an upgrade on smalling.
Wow Rio interviewing a Liverpool player now..oh wait..
The thing is they need it to be a little balanced like 68 shooting wtf
Do it with man utd players
What the... when did he ever face off against Studge?
The man, still miss him up in Glasgow one of the best players I've ever seen wear the hoops 🍀
Rio wants to be having a little chat with VVD about a cheeky switch to Old Trafford.
When is fifa 18 coming out
How can this man say sturridge is one of the hardest he has played against he literally had him in his pocket the hole match in the league cup
Guys I am from Holland van dijk Will never go to Liverpool he wants to go to Arsenal because of dutch players they had denis bergkamp,Marc overmars,Glenn helder
Those lips are every girls fantasy
The best and impossible
When I beatbox it sounds like this : BAMBIMBOMSSWJSLSJJAJSKSJBAKS..

This was so autumnal I love it😍😍
Nothing better than a cosy bubble bath, a hot chocolate and a 40 minute Autumnal Zoe vlog!
can I just say, your hair and makeup are ON POINT girl! flawless!
I’m so proud of zoe for trying to zorb ball a few years ago she wouldn’t have even tried ❤️
I love Jim and Zoe's friendship it's like a really caring casual friendship and I'm in love x
When they were both in the ball together lmao!
I love these long vlogs, nice to see jim and tanya, there so nice,and joe of course x i think you,d suit an arran cardigan zoe x
I wish pumpkin picking & Halloween was a thing in Australia! 🎃 I'm in Canada this year so definitely going to vlog it!
Pumpkin drums? Or DRUMpkins\n\n\n\nNo? Ok I'll leave
Zoe could you please do a wardrobe tour 😩😩
Terry's orange chocolate is my absolute fave 😍
Please do a boots haul
7:34 - 7:43 innuendo bingo😂 xx
Imagine going to a party with all your colleges and do a quiz about the private life of your boss. That would be crazy!!!
Time spent with good friends is the best! Zoe, you were so brave going in the Zorb? ball
I've been using Clue for about a year now and it is honestly so useful!
26.36 ‘ Our Future Children Alfie 💗😍’
Hi zoeeeeeeee❤️are you doing vlogmas or 24 days of zoella this year??????????plzzzz do vlogmas😍😂😘🎉🎄
Honestly loving how long the vlogs are😍👑
Love that you talked about Clue! I've been using it for a year now, and I really like it :)
hi Zoe I've seen you you out in public but I'm to nervous to say hi but also I've put your notifications on. your videos are also really inspiring
Is this right!? 40minutes!?☺ love u anyway xx stay positive
I love a good 40 minute vlog!!!!!!!!
Just in case you read this, I know a trick that can help you stop having headaches. It's a piercing you out or your ears called Deith. It reaaaally works. Maybe you could try?
Ah i have clue since 2 years 😅👏
your eyerbrows are really nice recentley
Who else knew she was going to say the clue app before she said it ! X
Wow your skin looks amazing Zoe ❣️
Aweee this is so fun watching you all play and I love how Joe is so brotherly with you when you were in the Zorb ball so sweet.. ❤️all of my fave youtubers but Mark, Sean and Poppy are not there..
In a way I like the adverts because it just makes the vlog last longer got something to watch for another 1 minute 😂😂😂😂😂
the amount of innuendos 😂
lbw, I'm subscribed! I love u so much! I have your life style bag and I love it! stay inspired :)
I love the long vlogs like these☺️♥️
I love your nails there so pretty xx
this is going to sound so confusing but I was just thinking..I have two sisters that are 26 and 24...the 24 year old's birthday is in march like yours and the 26 year old is turning 27 in October which is VERY close to Alfie's birthday. How ironic is this ?

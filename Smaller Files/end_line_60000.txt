Threw up
Holy shit, that one swipe tho.
That highlight had me squinting😂😂
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Kurt's crown was glowing. Damnnnn
Never heard Somone say that before
🌞🌞🌞🌞
girl u r beautiful 😉😉😉
Who gives a crap about what this asshole thinks?
Hi, im a bit new to you. I've had you on my Facebook forever but honestly never looked. My kids honestly don't let me do much then busy mom. Any who, is there a video that talks more of you? Just to get to know you better kind of thing. And what are the meanings to all your tattoos? They look cool..Love to look forward in continuing to see all your vids
I loved your apology and everything I'm a black girl with a lot of gay friends and I understand how hard it gets.... love this review keep doing your thing honey!!!
Babe I love your natural eyes
Oooooh Jeffre star buys a black girls makeup line. 🙄 surprise surprise.
jeffreestar, you should be a comedian....you are hilarious😊😊😊😊😊😊
If Beyoncé came out with a makeup line, the magnetic sticks would have been GENIOUS! But, Rihanna beat her to it. 🤑
Tbh that foundation girl !!! I feel like it makes you look 10 years younger . I was shocked 😳
Great review! The primer got rid of some of the redness. The makeup looks so natural and is a real enhancer.👏👏
what's the best way to apply foundation,, before or after eye makeup? a lot of you tubers do it after eye makeup but it just seems weird to me, does it work better to do it that way ?
WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOUR EYEBROWS OR ACTUAL REAL SKIN
He never said what foundation shade he used ):
Omg I love that you put foundation on the face tattoo on your neck! Lol!
I didn't like him before because what he's said and all the videos of him being racist. But now because of this video my prospective has changed. I love him now. This video was awesome and funny.
The nerve of u... this video ain't nothing but shade . GTFOH... ur full of shit . U have no business reviewing her line.and how often do u so reviews FRM ur bed of a WHOLE LINE?
Drink every time Jeffree says “give it a whirl
I feel like every one is giving the highlighter a positive review to stay on riris good side, but seriously it looks ridiculous!
Why y'all supporting this racist?
What the fuck are you?
I SWEAR JEFFREE IS LIKE THE BOMBEST MAKEUP ARTIST IN THE WORLD FJFKKSKSKSRP❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😘
That primer made instant improvements on you. I've watched several videos but I didn't see any improvement.  I might just buy it. 
The foundation looks so so good
He really tried it.
you should try SHU-UEMURA X SUPER MARIO BROS. Cosmetics line!!!!
How much did she pay you to say all of this? And how do you connect to such big pop stars. They obviously want you to promote their makeup.
Having Jeffree attend the Fenty Beauty launch party goes against everything the line stands for.
omg I loved how Jeffree also put foundation on the face of the lady on his neck hahaha
When a new product comes out the only review I trust is Jeffree's 😂😂❤❤❤
You look like you don't know which one of the 16.8 million genders you want to be. But you're good at makeup
He talks to much ,
Omg you look like a golden vampire from twilight
SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LAUNCHING PRODUCTS, WHO ARE JUST A CELEBRITY I'LL PUT MY NAME ON IT AND  CALL IT A DAY \n\n\nfucking love you
The packaging is very clunky.
you can use her blotting sheets as rolling papers too!
How can someone be so beautiful?
Can someone tell me why everyone hates him?
Damn. I am living for how well they matched you at the event. I need to try this! Always watching for the oxidation tho. But when you first put it on? Damn.
What shade are you?
I only watched this video to make sure there would be no rihanna slander
my mom just bought the trophy wife  o.m.g that highlighter is brighter than the solar eclipse it gives me life!!
did anyone else see that blue dot go through the screen?
I couldn’t help noticing u having lil cute chubby cheeks now❤️❤️
I'm curious.. When they go to these launches do they get all the products for free????🤔
I love unicorn and confetti - dislike the darkness of the brown contour
You can just hear Manny saying so pigmented about throphy wife.. from across the world
I wish these colours went with my skin tone. But they look extremely nice on dark and medium skin.
Please do a Dupe video for the gloss!!! Bc it's beautiful I love it 😍
Jeffree, you're the reason the Sephora near me was sold out in all the Fenty products 😭😭😭\n\n I still love you though
Loved the video Jeffree.Keep on slayin!!! I don't know if i missed this in the video but what shade are you using for your foundation?
hey Jeffrey my girlfreind loves your channel and sits up all night watching countess videos im wondering if there is a way i could get some makeup signed by you i will pay for it. pretty broke right now but i will figure it out our baby boy is due any time and i want that to be her present hope you see this -jordan
I feel like the gold highlighter has way too much glitter and this sounds weird to say, but too much pigment aswell😂😆
Please do a collaboration with Gigi♥️♥️💋
He said the Sponge was latex free, and I'm rejoicing.
I'd get makeup all over that comforter... lol
Why can’t there be a heart reaction like Facebook 😍
you looked so exited for this lol
Damn, a lot of people are bearing down on this video with the hate as if he wasn't literally *invited* to the launch party.\nPretty sure if Rihanna didn't want him reviewing her stuff, she would have made sure he didn't get invited.\nSo, if he's got her seal of approval... Maybe y'all need to get off your high horses.
why is ur racist ass buying from a black business... we dont want ur coins
Jeffree, would you please do tutorial using the bare minerals products??
He's definitely a taker
What a piece of shit.
love you
RIRI DONT WANT UR RACIST ASS WEARING HER MAKEUP BYEEEEEE ✌🏽✌🏽
OMG I love you! You're so funny! Wanna be my BFF???
This fruitcake is the perfect example of a mental disorder gone wild.
I love the the trophy wife highlighter, but I feel like it's more flattering on medium to dark skin tones but the frosty ones look amazing on him.
What are the duos for the lipgloss of RR
if Bella Throne was male .... this is definitely it
I looove that everybody prefers the brush over the sponge. Ive always preferred brushes over sponges, so I think I really need to buy is one.
Love you and your videos  jeffree thank u👍👍☺❤❤
I am dying to see full face organic. I love eminence! But I'd love to see your spin. Usually organic looks are so subtle! I want bold and beautiful!!
Heyy Jeffree so does your hair spray have some sparkle to it or is that excess from the power highlights?
omg I actually thought I was gonna be blind when that gold highlight appeared on Jeffreys cheeks ,especially when the phone light was on it
Why is Jeffree's skin 1 million times more amazing than anyone I know's skin..?\n\nLike TELL ME YOUR SECRETS JEFFREE XD
Jeffrey is as happy as a kid playing with their Christmas toys lol
I loved the video but guess what I make amazing videos too. Give me a chance and check my channel out! I appreciate it!!!!
Why are you reviewing a product that came from A BLACK WOMAN? weren't we niggers and shit not that long ago? 🤔
hey get some mental help dude with boobs😂😂
he doesn't have eyebrows? Hows that possible?
the tinnitus noise at 1:05 was toooo loud compared to the rest of the video, RIP HEADPHONE USERS
With 'Levels', he leveled up. Worked Out 'the days' and 'the nights'. 'Hey brother', you 'woke me up' and became 'a friend of mine'. Now I am 'feeling good' and 'waiting for love'. 'You be love.' 'Without you', I wouldn't be as inspired as I am today. You made me a 'true believer' and wear 'heart upon my sleeve'. We can fix the 'broken arrows' 'for a better day'. 'Pure grinding' is what we need to do to 'taste the feelings' of 'success.'  'Superlove' for you. 'Gotta love ya.' <3
all i can say....woah amazing :) everytime I Watch him  i feel so inspired  to go working on music, just amazing what he has accomplished and the new tracks he has made are AMAZING :)\nIf you guys want similar music i make same style music would be amazing to hear what you guys think :)
In all honesty, this might be one of the greater productions this year. Like if you CANNOT wait 🙏🏻
I wish I could hear Levels again for the first time.
Chris Martin <3
I am  waiting For OCTOBER 26 ..
If this movie gets released in India, Imma gonna go with Avicii Tshirt, Hat, Wristband & signboards.
That one dislike 😐
I really want a new Avicii in the studio to get new tips from this awesome producer.
This one's like Jumpers for Goalposts. Can't wait to see dat documentary!
I hope this movie is also released online, not only in theaters
That beautifull intro song in 0:11 to 0:17 ?????
I never got to see you !!! I just came to leave to USA 2 years ago and my dream was to see you live. I hope one day you can go on tour again and maybe dial it down a bit for the places to go and get more rest between shows. I hope for your best
He just needs more money thats all
best EDM artist in the universe True Story <3 ◢ ◤
i have to see this
Will it be in Spain too? Because I think it will be my favourite film lol.
Please Avicii make a comeback to melodic progressive house :) !
I'm so excited about this movie Tim !! Already bought ticket 😍😍
I love you Tim
He's doing this as Bach, did what he did Sooooo he has no clue what Bach did
Cryvichhi not worth it, always follow what others do. Copyright song together martin garrix take the credits only. Cancel full tour and some festivals cause hes a drug addict / alcoholic and say it was to much. Want some attention. Stop playing drama and shut the doors in music industry and get a gf and family
These days everyone has to have some kind of movie/documentary of their own,fuck me man.....
Its my bday on 26th Oct....And my gift is ready....a grand gift....
Hope these talented artists make the brightest COLORS!
https://youtu.be/64vWZsZ-Duk\nCheck out this track
what wrong with your health #avicii ? i am concerned.
Will it be played in indonesia?
Will it be possible to watch in germany? Would like to, since you had done no last gig in germany :( Its a pity for me, that i had no possibility to see you one last time, so the movie would be a good compromise :)
OMG!!! I need It now 😱😍
This is a must watch!
who the motherfu$% disliked  this video.
Hope it's going to be released in France !
I thought this was a new album...
What happened to his health ??
Finally we've got the release date!!! Yay!
i am waiting for it
This is going to be sick
i hope they show the moment where he pooped on stage and then just wiped it casually ;)
Always wanted to know more about you, now it's the time
Really cool to see what happened behind the scenes of all the madness, been listening since 2009, excited to see it!

I Can't Wait till 26 October
Estaría bueno que este traducido al español 💔
Avicii ❤
Mate for about 5 minutes I thought it was dirt on my screen then I found it was Poets Mole on his head
You can tell most the guys who watched this video don't care about boxing.. All the comments are about AJ's hairline lmao. \n\nHe's a boxer, he's got bigger things to worry about. If you ever seen him in camp he has a afro because he's locked away in the gym putting in hard work so much so he doesn't even have time for a trim.
Oh my god! The thing sitting on the right of the sofa... Kill it!
£30 or £40 quid for a ticket?? eddie hearn makes sure that price at least triples
This could be a good podcast if longer, especially with this level of guests!
Jaiden Smith and willow fused into one being and formed the dude on the right.
Such a humble dude, can't help but love him
12:03 best part of the interview! haha nearly 1am an i woke up everyone in my house laughing! lol Where's David?
You guys should sit with Logic!!!
Why the fuck is he eating crisp stupid prick.
That pack of dorritos must have been full to the brim Poet
Omg why did it take poet more then 3 minutes to eat one crisp 😂
AJ seems like a real safe lad . loved the interview copa90 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
get mc qackes mans not hot next fifa n chill
why is he sat there eating Doritos during an interview?
Damn AJ what the fuck is that supercuts hairline
AJ where ever you we go :d
Get a channel for just poet and vuj, it's the only reason why you have over 1 million subs
you should put the link to the fight vid in the description :/
I cant watch this due to the plank eating the crisps, maybe im easily irritated
All day and he wants to eat a loud packet of shite crisps fix up
I wanted to see the fights
Don't want to shake your hands because mine are dirty, shakes Vuj's hand, and vuj shakes Joshua's hand, I found that to be very funny, great interview by the way.
he literally has poets laugh, im dead
where's david? when AJ repeated it was it an indirect to Haye?😉
Ajs arms are bigger than his head
Anthony's thighs bout to rip them jeans watch out lmao
'Pay 30-40 quid for a ticket'? Not if Eddie hearn has anything to do with it..
We are liverpool and we are fucking shite
I swear poet was born a woman, looks hella feminine lol
Do fifa and chill with Thomas Muller
What kind of man is this , some man a discussing and one is busy eating crisps like a little girl whats that all bout ?. shaking head violently like a bitch. English lads stop confusing your selves . If you are born a man you are a man . There is a lot of mental health problems in this country, its a serious problem .
Love the vid but why do you mugs eat in every video no one wants to hear you chewing
What the fuck is that Poet wearing??
I think that his hairline is perfect but he is experiencing alopecia by his hairline.
You could fit a fucking runway between that guys eyes.
6:00 mans a westbrom fan but its aj so ill lowe him😂
Mark my words, within 5 years the biggest fight of the decade will be Anthony Joshua vs Daniel Dubois
How does poet take the whole video to finish off that small packet of crisps?
Yaya yaya yaya 
Wow no question about potential fight vs wilder in near future? Certain there will be one at least?
I swear to god thats brika brika like if you know what iam talking bout// don't jealous me ;p
big femi! gonna get schooled by fuiry so should go for wilder first get a big W my man
You hear that boxing fans? Even AJ said everyone would get folded in the Octagon. An MMA fighter can last few rounds in the boxing ring. A boxer wouldn't last 1 minute in the octagon.
His hairline is fucked but I probably wouldn't say that to his face
Stop eating during the interview dickhead
Poet is such a dickhead
As a trans girl, I can tell you with 98% certainty that Poet is transitioning. Much respect. Get on that estrogen baby.
love Anthony he's just so down to earth
How can anyone hate AJ after this. The guy is so humble and chilled
International... Real Madrid \n\nAnthony is that guy.
lol maybe he don't watch football yo focus on boxing
Raaah took poet 15 mins to finish a bag of crisp 😂
They look like a pair of tramps
Doesn't understand transfers ? Lol come again mate ?
█▬█ █ ▀█▀ 18+ ➨ http://tinyurl.com/y9khv8h9
Vuj is so sly. He handshaked AJ after Poet handshaked him with his Dorito hands 😂😂
Poet stop eating and show some respect man
Can i film this for you. Weird noise onscreen and pretty horrible colour grade.
AJ is a hell of lad! top top guy
This guy seems so chill!
What a guy!
That kubre part killed me 😂😂😂
Next Time mc Gregor
#getridofpoet
going places!
Poets fashion sense is dog shit
ROLL SAFE
Fifa and chill with roadman shaq aka Michael Dapaah #mansnotnot
Joshua got a bowl trim
Vuj is really badly mic'd up
Yessss anthony joshua
them dudes look or dress gay
THE METLINE
Where's David😂😂
CONOR MCGREGOR AND CHILL PLEASE!!!!
Sue your barber, Joshua!
Should fight Floyd imo
Hahaha vuj looks like a twig next to Joshua!!
Give Vuj a better microphone :))))))))
Lol eating doritos whilst interviewing aj are you mad??
#Fifa17
AJ makes Vuj and Poet look mad underweight lol
Well said AJ.....
Bun Toure fight Bailly or Akinfenwa
Poet looks ill as fuck, starvation looks real
''WINGERS AND DEAD-RINGERS EVERYWHERE''.
He's always smiling
Dat hairline though
My Nigerian and Ijebu brother!!! 💪
That mmmm made me laugh
Man Like Anthony
Best one yet!!!👊🏽
Vuj looks hella uncomfortable.. hella
He said his favourite international team is real Madrid 😂😂😂
Smh no proper boxing questioned asked, fuming
Yes AJ! COYH 🐝💛
Love aj's laugh 😂😂😂
Anthony Joshua is a best. been following him for a while and feel like he is the heavyweight heir to Tyson. dude is pure class and wish him the best from the US.
I love the analysis top notch
More videos like this, they know so much bout footy just listening to them talk is making me better lmao
How Scholes,Keane and Adams are in this team is disgusting?
Neville, Ferdinand, Terry, Cole, Gerrard and Lampard in the same team. How in the hell did this golden generation of players never win or let alone ever come close to winning a major tournament as part of English national team?
Why is the BBC accepting the Sky/Murdoch propaganda that there was no football before the 'premier' league?
i think Paul Scholes has to be in that team....and barnes over giggs in my opinion. Best partner for Shearer for me is Sheringham
Giggs is the most overrated player in PL history. Pires>Giggs easily
WHAT ABOUT VAN PERSIE!!!!!!! His first touch was incredible and his skill was unbelievable. The goals he scored....... Remember his header when he won 5-1 against Spain??
Since this is only a hypothetical midfield,  Gerrard and Lampard defo
Yeah right, why was Shearer in this discussion? I think we already knew the outcome and I agree with Henry Shearer duo.\nBut it's kinda funny to see him here. lol.
Lampard lmao.
No Scholes, Vieira or Keane. Ok?
Where is Silva??? A true magician with the ball, the most underrated player in the Premier, he is simply superb week in week out.
I would have to separate Gerrard and Lampand. Take Lampand out and put in Scholes or Virera. I would put Scholes in.
I think all three of Lampard, Gerrard and Scholes could have played together. The problem was England crowbarring players into a flat 4-4-2 formation (like the one on this video) that couldn't accommodate them...as well as insisting on playing two strikers in an old fashion model. It's so obvious that it should have been:\n\n                                                                      Scholes\n                                                            Gerrard     Lampard\n\nThats England's midfield should have setup. Scholes playing as the holding midfielder with Gerrard and Lampard playing in front of him.
How can we not have Scholes!!
Stam, Okocha, and Zola left out?
If only Wenger knew how much Ty backed him, Ty would be getting a lift home from him
Ty was ready to go in for the kiss!
The ting goes Skrapppp Pap Pap Pap Pap 🇫🇷
Who else had the same feeling as me.......that TY would be there before.......I clicked on the video!😂😂
Look who is In front riding dick lol
Ty hahaha
Lucky, should have asked why he hasn't played laca alexis and ozil together yet
Get Ty out of there, Wenger must be so sick of seeing his face
#wengerout
We speak to arsene lmao, he sat there listened and gave a rye smile. Clickbait much :/
Arsene not responding to TY, trying not to go public with their love story in front of the cameras
'Should've told him to get out of the club' don't be ridiculous, you can't say that shit to his face. Be respectful even though it's time for him to go.
Leave our club
I bet ty was jizzing his pants when wenger stopped for him
Arsenal supporters are mugs with more money than sense. Clowns club.
I forget ty is in his 40's.
I didn't see it
how fucking long do these losers stay after the game? just to ask one stupid question
Proof YouTube trending is bs. This is at 31.5k views, is 2 days old, less than 450 total likes/dislikes and is 22nd on trending.
ty looks like he's about to suck arsenes dick
He hates you gooner fans you can just tell. Can't blame him either, bunch of brown nose back stabbers.
Ty tryna jump in the back seat
This is cringe!   It's that TY mugster.
How far does Ty wanna go up Arsene's arse.
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD GET ANYONE EXCEPT TY TO ASK ARSENE QUESTIONS 😫😫😫😫
Wenger in
Ty's creaming in his pants hahaha wee gimp
the state of our fans..IGNORANT, fickle bandwagon morons
ty probably nutted in his pants
1sniff 2sniff
Fixed strategies
How Much Ass You Wanna Lick TY.
Wenger in
TY Bumbsucking
Ty wanted to sniff Wenger's ARSE!!
Ty thinking his uber pool pulled up
#WengerOut
Ty cracked a semi
leave him alone ffs
Ty , wenger is his grandfather
AW is happy and in a good mood normally AW doesnt lower his window. How many times was TY waiting till midnight for Wenger to come out and Wenger didnt turn up or already left the stadium. Poor bloke
Arsene rolling thru like a fresh salmon
Shouldve told him to leave, tf is this?
Wow what a long chat. U guys must be his best buddies.
Did he throw a water 💦 bottle 🍶 at you?
When the outro is longer than the actual video
Ty get your nose out of wengers rear end.lol arsenal fc not arsene fc.
Makes sense..Ty does have the intelligence of a child
should have told him to get out of the club!
Can't believe you got to meet the worst premier league manger in history
Clickbait
Why doesn't anybody smash his windows, I wish I stayed longer
Please can you do a costume tutorial? :)
Hey, do you mind not having a guest that speaks like she's gargling marbles and cum? K thx.
This reeks of moral posturing and social justice prestige.  Oh, to simply have a review of a drama without moral scolding would be delightful.
. . . not to diss on Stephen King, but, i think some of his gore/rape/fanfic-vest needed some filtering . . . holy fucking what even Stephen . . .\n\nAlso jesus what is with all the spam bots
I would love to see a golden compass one of these
DO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE FOR THE NEW MOVIE!!!
Got to get the obligatory irrelevant bigotry in old book from long time ago in there.
So although the actual explanation was well done, there are a few structural issues with this video. The parts where you showed the montages from the mini series felt to me like an excuse to just fill time in the video, it was unneeded and detracted from your point more than supported it. My other issue was with the stupid steven kings face on a stabbing man accompanied by the maniacal cackling. That was really annoying and during one part of the video I actually could not hear the dialogue over the royalty free maniacal laughter. Other than that, good video.
Glad the new IT movie is scarier & cant wait for them to be adults in this generation.
STEPHEN KING WHAT THE FUCK.
Wait I love the scene when Ben and Mike ride around on the silver bullet. I couldn't get that Temptations song out of my head. It played the whole time I watched the new It lol
ummh lurah pruduh buthuwhuy, could you take the dick out of your mouth the next time you record a video? THANK YOU!
I really like how the newest one got a lot of those details right... I'm also glad that they toned down the uh... Promiscuous stuff in favor of a more down to earth story focused on children. I'm so excited for part two!
Tom: So how many sex partner's have you had? \nBeverly: Uhm 1..2..6 guys \nTom: That's not so bad I guess \nBeverly: On the same night..when I was 12..In a cave \nTom: .-.
WTF she fucked them all at like age 12???  WTF King, WTF??
Mini Series? I am confused a little. I thought It was a movie base don the book.
Ask your girlfriend to not be a part of this anymore. She's barely audible and the noise she makes is horrible.
Wait... is it ITS or IT's?
There is a fucking NIGGER in the group, they already had to fill up quotas in 1990 to please SJWs and their Diversity ?!
6:37 I always knew H20Delirious would snap one day.
Did anyone else notice the knife that animated Stephen King is holding a glowing hot knife?
GOD THERE'S SO MANY FUCKING SPAMMERS AND SCAMMERS
How many people thought this was going to be a comparison between the old miniseries and the new 2017 IT movie ?
Frankly, based on this description, I think the mini-series was probably better than the book.
I thought this was going to be about the new movie
Also, and most people don't know this, the novel is extremely graphic and intense; there's even one scene where King spends about a dozen pages describing a gangbang scene in which the boys all have sex with the girl. I'm not kidding. Look it up.
Do The Shawshank Redemption
Do dark tower yay
Oh boy
May we elaborate on the underage gangbang?\n                                      -Mike Stoklasa, 2017
Kiss me, fat boy!
It reminds me of Earthbound
wiggle wiggle
Yay gangbang
Sex at 12????
Do a comparison of the book vs. the 2017 movie
that laugh at the beginning was itwards laugh from fran bow!
miniseries????? 😂 dude, just call it a movie 😂
The adult sections of IT reminded me of The Room. But funnier.
I'm surprised. I thought we'd get a crappy, poorly scripted discussion in the middle of an office.
Both of them were pretty much filmed entirely in Canada.
Tim Curry for the Win!
That Google animation joke was INSPIRED.
conclusion:\nthe book is more gory than the mini series
Now I can't stop thinking of Beverly marsh ... lol
What's sad here is that it wasn't done right back in the 90's due to the standards of the time and what could be seen on public TV, given today's standards and practices I can already tell the movie will be less accurate than the mini series
I dunno if you're being entirely fair to King here - yes, his books are bloated, but it's usually intentional so as to completely immerse the reader in another place and time. It's all about theme and mood man.
stephen king has problems man . hes got problems
Am I the only one that didn't like IT :/?
You didn't say that Stan was jewish in the book and a boy scout in the movie
Wow, I had no idea she had sex with all of them especially like that. I think I do remember someone telling me that she sleeps with all of them but I can't be too sure if my mind is playing tricks on me.
Saw this as a young child and still confused as to way so many people love it. It is about as boring as paranormal non activity.
They should've made it darker and more disturbing... It was watered down but for no reason...? Young viewers would have had a hard time trying to get in and watch the movie so I don't know why they steered clear of adult themes when the movie is for adults and in no way for children. They could've incorporated sexual themes as well. The underlying message of the story circulates around the theme of coming of age. I admit sexual scenes can be uncomfortable but i think the integration of some of the sexual/horror scenes would have given the movie a more clearer view of one of it's messages and symbols....Not the group sex though....That was unneeded
and then in the 2017 IT, Beverly is a victim of everyone thinking she's a floozy
I bet King is happy that it's getting a better remake. This is one of the remakes that's done it right. Excited for the second.
I'm not scared of Tim curry with a balloon fetish

Can't wait to see this movie..I've just been consumed by Destiny lol

Jesus Christ all those kids grew up to be hella successful, I would love to have been in that friend circle. Oh yea the killer clown would have been a slight inconvenience
Now I know why my grandparents wont let me read the book till I'm older..... My mom hasn't read it and she says I can but I think Ill wait
i loved the miniseries so much
I'd like to see you talk about the new movie. It seemed to me that some of the characters were given much smaller roles and only a handful are important.
so how the fuck do i get into the losers club where do i sign?
racial insensitivity when talking about Richies jokes... times were different, people werent uptight like they are now.
Mike DOES find a picture of Georgie in the book. It's just in a different location and under different circumstances. Bill mentions it being the picture that went missing from Georgie's photo album.
12 year old gangbang what in the fuck dude.
Is anyone getting the vibe that Steven King might be a pedophile?\n\nCus I'm pretty having the kids have sex with each other was going a little over the concept of becoming adults early...
Oh shit she fucks them one after the other? Lmfao yo wtf
The old it was way creepier than the new one. The new it is definitely more entertaining however
So the kids had an orgy
there is a book, and you do the whole remake thing, meh

the ONLY reason i  disliked it is because i could be the 1000th dislike otherwise i would like it
If Stranger Things had started out as a Stephen King novel, when Eleven started to undress in front of the boys instead of stopping her they would have let her get naked, then gotten naked themselves, took turns having sex with Eleven, and because they had sex with her the boys would have gained their own psychic powers. Also Dr. Brenner would make it clear that once Eleven hit puberty he planned on impregnating her personally the old fashioned way to see if her powers could be passed on genetically.
teeth are sooooo ugly and disgusting but not scary 😂

What a pity that you guys can't help but let your leftist ideology slip through the cracks.
Nothing solidify's a good friendship like a seven way gangbang, in a filthy sewer from hell.  It would of been awesome if Bev's Dad walked in on them. That was clearly his biggest fear. Those kids would have bigger problems then that clown.

no bill.... It's really fucking easy to hate hillary even compared to trumpy dump
And why the hell is he getting a book deal? My goddess.
he seems like a pansy
So, this Bone idiot NOT talking has made him a hero with right wingers. Can you fools get any worse? I'm sick of people like Maher making this jackass important. He should be ignored like every rational person in his life has done. I know exactly what he is.
To think that Russia meddled with the election is retarded, Trump hasn't done anything in Russia's favor so far, in fact he has done more against Russia. Also there is absolutely zero evidence for it. Also the top CNN contributor who is extremely anti trump and left leaning admitted that the whole Russia thing was a nothing burger so it's pretty much debunked at this point, old news. But I'm sure they'll find more ways to connect the two even though it's proven to be false by now.
Nothing but respect for Ken Bone. We need more voices like this!
I'm Ken Bone.
Fuck this guy and everyone like him. Complaining about Republicans the entire time but still somehow enamored by Donald Trump. Sure, Hillary wasn't amazing but if you took one look at her policies compared with Trump, how the fuck could you even consider trump. Ken Bone, I hope you fucking die of a horribly slow and painful cancer, along with your entire family and everyone you ever appreciated in this world. Fuck you.
I used to think Ken Bone was a dumbass, but he's actually pretty intelligent. He's also smart enough to never tell anyone who he voted for, not because he cares about influencing people. Please. Because as soon as anyone knows who he voted for, his value goes way down. He's the undecided poster child. He has to maintain that undecided aura.
I'm sorry I'm distracted by the hair sticking out of the side of Bills head :-)
He's wearing a red sweater. That's saying something.
MSNBC is equally as far left as Fox is far right.
Ken Bone is a rational human being. Bounced on my boy's rationality for hours.
He voted for McCain, he voted for Romney, he voted for Hillary. All the same. Unfortunately, the guy we thought was going to be different ended up being the same too (Obama).
Don't be fooled by the undecided voter deal.  He's a pathetic, timid, weak pawn of the establishment to move along their agenda while publicly whoring himself out for money/attention/fame.  He also wears red sweaters on tv and agrees to talk to people who publicly mock him openly on national TV and he acts like nothing is wrong.  He's clearly a Democrat.
Ken Bone for President!!💪
Bill Maher, you fucking suck... Ken Bone? Really? Why don't you invite some real progressives on your show like Cenk Uygur, or Lee Camp, or Glen Greenwald (haven't seen him in a while), or Chris Hedges? No, you invite crazy right wingers, establishment lefties, celebs, and fucking memes like Ken Fucking Bone. You used to be be an actual progressive voice, Bill Maher, and now you're just a fucking out-of-touch retard.
Hes not hard to understand. He is the average American when it comes to political thinking. The majority of our country doesnt care about how ppl live their own lifes. We don't care about political bullshit. We just want it to work how its supposed to.
The Gettable? i don't even know that word exist lol
The guy is an idiot. Its cute how he thinks he really has the power to significantly influence people though. Still, I won't put anything past this country anymore!
Could not agree with Bone's my vote is my business. We need more of it. Especially from celebrities and news anchors and reporters. In fact I would suggest that all famous people should not be allowed to vote. Because they are biased.
I am not sure why Bill Maher was trying to make a sales pitch. I think he is very knowledgeable on most things and you could have a debate with him without getting all worked up. I think people need to go in a discussion with an open mind instead of trying to preach or change one's opinion.
He always gives me a full boner
The GOP has in a roundabout way succeeded in Gerrymandering the Electoral College, that is why they won.
Independence = Freedom. Take from it what you will.
This man needs to run in 2020. I'd vote for him if I was an American, but I can't because I'm British and sensible
It's amazing how Ken Bone appears more composed than Bill  Maher.
I don't understand the praise of this man. Really? You were undecided after listening to Trump's grab 'em by the _____ hot-mic moment? You were undecided after learning Trump deliberately barged into the dressing rooms of underage girls' pageants? After mocking a reporter with a disability? After the Trump University scam? After using charity funding to settle personal legal disputes?
Interesting interview. I thought at first this guy was a joke, but I enjoyed hearing his perspective.
Works at the power plant? Boner Simpson?
So Bill doesn't know why Hillary isn't liked? She voted for the Iraq war, tpp, is being funded by Sadie Arabia, voted for the wall between Mexico and the USA, voted for more war if she was president and she doesn't know why people dont like her? By the way trump would of done the same thing that Hillary did because he said it in interviews and was making deals with Sadie Arabia during the primary and as president was bought off by them #bernieorbust
Please don't feed him anymore he is about to explode.
Ken Bone is just trumps Joe the plumber.
Ken Boone, was one of the better guests in recent memory.
Holy shit. Going back to rewatch this piece i cant help but be reminded how much se cupp ruined this episode. Her suck is even intenser. This was a nice interview. Why do we need to know his vote? He is right idc and there are dummies that would care too much. He had good answers.
The guys a good dude
If the Dems want to get guys like this maybe they ought to push American ideals like production,  the Individual,  freedom and prosperity instead of their usual left wing,  collectivism.   Pathetic. \n\nYou know He voted for Trump!   MAGA bitches.
You know what?  Fuck this guy.  Why are this small minority of people who are so lame that they couldn't make up their mind in such a polarizing election suddenly become the only people who are catered to and ultimately, choose the political future of our country?
Seems like Bill was regretting bringing Ken Bone on the show by the end of the interview.
OH GOD I WAS MOLESTED BY A REL ESTATE LADY
Bill's impression of his own influence on the electorate is the most hilarious thing about him. I'll be honest with yuh; I have a dog in this fight: I wanna convince you. One minute within earshot of Bill's Maheronic audience tells even the most politically ignorant sap exactly whom Maher controls: those who already agree with what little he actually has to say.
Time to make the doughnuts.
Ken is much more articulate and personable than I had imagined.
Lmao, ​let it fucking go, Bill! Jesus, Hillary was a bad candidate stop reaching and move on broski!
Look I didn't vote for either disaster in this past election...and I didn't vote for the escaped mental patients called Jill Stein and Gary Johnson either...but the fact that Maher cannot even grasp why people dislike/despise Hillary shows me that he is out of touch and clueless about what many Americans think
sorry bill, you're funny and all that, but this guy has a much more politically open mind than you..wake up
He's right...80 days for elections in Canada is too long. If you can't articulate your positions and sell yourself in 80 days...you don't deserve to be elected
Ken Bone.  Man of the sweater.  Lover of prego porn.  lol.
He voted Trump. Any other answer would have gotten him a round of applause, and he'd have no problem saying it in public. He's not stupid, he doesn't want leftist mobs coming after him.
Of course you're confused by Ken Bone, Bill...he represents the future of balanced political thinking.
Ken Bone is an idiot that loves attention.  I know he says he doesn't, but you can tell he's one of those people that acts all undecided so he'll get focused on.  Everything he was saying he believes in politically like taxing corporations and rich people more is Democratic ideology, yet he still says he's not a Democrat.  We're in a sad state when this putz becomes a viral hero.
towards the end bill completely disrespects Ken by talking about him as if he wasn't talking to the man himself
A seemingly intelligent man with an open mind? HE'S A WITCH.... BURN 'IM.... BURN 'IM!
Ken Bone is legit the definition of a nice man.
Tell us, plebian - why don't you like us?
News to me. Only white people are presumed innocent I guess.
From his last statement you know he voted for Hillary :)
I guess Ken Bone has been hit with so many political discussions he's learned how to handle himself. Bill Maher was getting frustrated with him. But I think Mr Bone was one of clearest thinkers I've seen on any show in recent years. If he was the average voter we'd have a chance of returning to a political system that could almost work again. Mr Bone has successfully bridged what to most people is a fixed, unbridgeable partisan political divide. Good for you, Ken.
This Ken Bone dude has quite a good view on those political shenanigans. He hold is ground with gusto!
Real time with Ken Bone
Bill. This guy actually has a lot of intelligence, and very libertarian. I don't understand why, in this interview, you're being a dick to him. He speaks as a normal voter. I don't agree with everything he says, but he spoke it all very well and explained his thinking very straight forward
This dude restored my faith in America
Maybe because Hillary Clinton went MIA during the campaign and Trump was having double header rallies in the swing states. Don't underestimate the power of likeability, or unlikeability in her case.
Stop trying to make Ken Bone a thing.
You must have been molested by a real estate agent...😆😭😵
I put off watching this video because I thought it would be cringy. Wound up being an intelligent, honest, non confrontational conversation. Just a well spoken regular guy on  TV. Refreshing.
I love when straight up people with zero agenda like this guy just baffels Politicians and Bill Maher. They just don't get it when people are human beings.
At the end he basically said he voted for Hillary.
That Homer Simpson moron voted for Trump. If you can't recognize that Trump is a scumbag that is unfit for office you are part of the problem. Trump is a failed president.
The US has interfered in foreign elections four more times than any other foreign country try to interfere with us elections. You folks have to do your research.
Shit I thought this was old
Clinton is a two faced, pandering, corrupt, shill, lying piece of political shit. There's no reason to like her. She's the most fake person I've ever seen run for president
I think Bill thought this interview would go differently than it did.
Smart man.
Guy looks like your typical reddit neckbeard cuckold.
I like how Ken was making clear the whole time that this interview shouldn't take place
I don't believe for a second that this guy was undecided.
Bill she isn't a centrist, she is center-right. She is a corporate democrat bitch, neo-liberal mongrel that is so incapable of self reflection that she released a book blaming everyone else but herself for her lose in 2016. You have such a huge blind spot for her and it annoys the hell out of me.
Courting idiots like Ken Bone is the reason democrats lost the election. Democrats should be trying to get the votes of progressives by offering them policies that will actually improve their lives like single payer healthcare, affordable education, election reform, raising the minimum wage and job creation. If they did that they'd never lose a presidential election again. Stop trying to win the vote of indecisive idiots like Ken and focus on trying win back the vote of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party.
Ken Bone is boning all the pussies at this point
So many ignorant people... Ken Bone is ignorant. Voting Gary Johnson is retarded. Those who hated Hillary for being too right wing fell for Russian propaganda on the internet, then there are the butthurt communists who can't handle moderation. And I HATED hillary and am conservative but Hillary was the only logical choice in 2016. Those who voted for Trump are braindead.
The comment on the racist Criminal inJustice System got the thumbs up.

Can we get update in iPhone 6s
Is this new IOS on iPhone 6 products as well??
Hey man, what case are you using on your iPhone? it really looks great.
I'd love to see the video about if the iPad Pro can replace your laptop.
I would like that
I heard the iphone 8 and iOS 11 is awesome, oh, finally, it's catching up to S6...
IPhone are behind on releasing tech and features but for some reason everyone thinks it's the greatest stuff.     They are about to release the iPhone x with wireless charging and it's in the news papers like it's an original thing.  Samsung have been doing wireless charging since the s6.   Wtf....
I wish iPhone 8 would make a bundle for those deaf people with a Cochlear Implant with a Nucleus 6 or lower. That would be a badass upgrade.
Can I get IOS 11 on my iphone6S!???
are all those features coming to iphone 6 plus as well?,i know the update is compatible with iphone 6 plus but i don't if it may be limited by hardware on some features.
What's your screen protector?

hey where do you get your iPhone wallpapers from?
Dude iPhone is so late on this features android been doing for years
Android has done it before ...
Anyone know where the posters in the background are from?
Did you switch back from the Galaxy s8?
I really want there to be a feature where you can download apps to record things your doing on your phone. They only have them on other types of phones but not for iOS devices. You can use hacks to download the apps but it will only let you for one minute. They should make it so it Doesn't show your battery percentage or time for privacy purposes. And so it is long than one minute.
Can people just get android already? Lol we've been waiting for customisability... I sure haven't ...
The document scanning (if it works correctly) will be great. Big day tomorrow for Apple!! btw 5203 notifications??? I'd pass-out with that many notifications pending. LOL. Great Video. :-)
I'm not an Apple user and probably will never be one, but chapeau to Apple that they've turned their iPads into Mini-iMacs with iOS 11.
My friend has that update
When is iOS 11 gonna be released? Btw keep up the good work!

In other words make it more like android which is better

I think the iPad is slowly turning into a computer
CooooooooooL . Can we drag and drop in iphone 7+ ?
you GOTTA make the replace a laptop video - thats my no. 1 question!!
people dont realize that its the little things that count
Anything that allows us to customize and give a little bit more freedom, I'm up for it.\n\n\nTHEN SWITCH TO ANDROID..........
I'd love to see an iPad pro vs laptop video
I thought there was gonna be new features and these features are taken from android smh
Stuff that iPhone are coming out with andriod had that ages ago. And iphones are rip of just paying more for a bigger screen. I use to be a apple fan but when Steve jobs passed away they just went shit and ran out of ideas
Tbh apple is better because it's more simple. I recently got an android and it took me forever to get cellar data on

Wow, apple devices getting features android has had for years... I can't wait to see the excitement on my apple friends faces...
Oh NO WAY! So the new features are just simple things samsung have been using since 2010. That is great;)
Been on Android for a while. Might give Apple 1 more chance.
I already have it lol 😂
Can I get your wallpaper at 0:36? 😄😄

Please make a video about an iPad Pro replacing your laptop, I want to see which one is better for me based on your feedback. Thanks!! 🙌

I have it already hmu if u want it right away fam
new sub! been watching for a while now tho. love those day in the life videos, keep up the great work.
My friend had the beta of this. The next day his phone broke. We told him he should've waited
I definitely think a video on whether or not the iPad Pro can replace your laptop would be a great idea. The current generation was fairly close to replacing my laptop for classroom purposes, but I still needed my laptop most of the time. Maybe the new variation will be closer to replacing a laptop completely!

At 6:41 Matthew's lack of reaction is what I aim for in life :P
Ed looks like a is a cool dude to hangout with.
Matthew McConoughey's awfully quiet
Anyone know when the next series starts?
a date putting up a lego set???...  I mean it would be the BEST DATE EVER!!!!!
His friend James is cute
Graham's show is by far the best chat show ever!
THIS IS WHY I LOVE HIM
And suddenly he's on national television, shaking hands with Matthew McConoughey, Chistina Ricci and Josh Widdicombe. Must have been quite a night...
He's so funny
That lego story is just what I would do if I got a lot of money XD
I've just cried and sobbed for hours after an unfortunate event and I just came here to level up my mood and once again I laughed and forgot all my troubles for a while. Thank you for the upload❤
ed and matthew... what more could i ask for
He's such an honest, genuine bloke. I wish there were more like him. Great role model for our youth.
Put my foot in a boiling geezer Sounds like a bar fight in Manchester
What I've learned is that Ed is a rebel or don't know how to take instructions LOL.  He should watch Keanu's interview here on Graham about that motorcycle accident and learn from the master.

Why, oh WHY?  Can't we get good TV like this in the States?  [Sad Face]
I love Ed Sheeran.  His songs, but also the fact that he's such a down-to-earth person.  However the Graham Norton show episode I'm enthusiastically waiting for is the one where the Star Wars cast will be on here promoting The Last Jedi in December 🙌🙌
Christina feels so out of place :/\nNo one allows her to talk.
Apparently he made up that whole sword story. Funny but weird thing to do. According to James Blunt anyways.
Ok but how does Ed look younger than before
Ed is such a pure and genuine soul. I love him.
If anyone had brought on a Lego set on a date before I'd met the husband he'd have never had a chance.
2:54 taylor swift
That ending is amazing omg wtf
Wow! Wednesday's changed.😮
'Don't do that!'\nEd: 'Why?'\n*Does thing anyway*\n*Sees why*
This is so golden. Perfectly shows everyone's personality and how good of a host Graham is. Graham wants them to meet so he said they can meet backstage and Ed being the chill guy he is is like bring him to the couch. And Graham graciously agrees because he knows so well how to work with his guests. McConaughey is perfectly calm and polite through it all, even the burning skin story which is hilarious and crazy
It was a funny interview, but we all know that it was set-up, right? Maybe Ed Sheeran wasn't in on it, but a publicist and a producer definitely made that happen.

did Graham really did this through the whole show? and ignored everyone else?

I still don't know who this Ed Sheeran guy is.
If someone's being offensive, they need to be informed that they're being offensive SJW ALERT SJW ALERT! UNREASONABLE CRAZY MAN! *Note, I am being sarcastic.
She's not wrong but she's not right. The mom will never be able to truly relate. But she will be able to feel. I'm pro-LGBT but I recently found out my little sister was bisexual. And that changed EVERYTHING. I started seeing the discrimination more clearly, the everyday homophobia, the hurtful comments... it broke my heart. I cried and held her in my arms knowing I'd never be able to protect my little sister and I'd never be able to understand what she feels and worst : I can't stop it. But I could feel for her, I could side with her, shoulder her. And I realized my privilege, my capacity to ignore homophobia without even noticing it was there UNTIL my sister came out. She doesn't have that privilege. And me using that to shoulder her is what truly composes a family. The mother doesn't have to face the same discrimination to be her mother, all she has to do is stand by her in face of that discrimination. Bless.
That first women, thank you so much for screaming at the other bitch
The child is so cute
You guys should do one episode of racism towards Mexicans especially with the DACA going around
I wonder if we'd get the same reaction with a man and boy
They're a cute family <3
Ugh I flipping hate racist people *-.-* I Would Never Ever Do That ;-;  I have different kind of friends but I would never..
Wtf, lady? This isn't the 50s. Get your racist ass out of there.
Watching this during all the protests smh
Plz don't ever do this in my town ...I would punch this bitch immediately and then get sued by ABC
That's sad poor little girl  lol it doesn't matter Jesus made us all  equal
That moment when the child always uses her iPad when everything is happening
There are still good people in the world.
I have the same headphones as the little gurl
This made me cry
Amen! That grandfather said it better than I could ever say it!
being from nc she wouldnt have grilled that woman like that in front of people like myself and others.  we take care of our own
Go grandpa. That was amazing how he spoke his mind and such.
you know it's a good show when you thank the Lord Jesus for the well raised people on this earth
lol the woman that flatly said you are a rude bitch is so me...i dont have time to calmly explain what was rude or bitchy...i just call it out
Let the mother love whom ever she wants to.
I am agree this I was upset.
Jazelle is the best bitch actress
That little girl is so cute omg
tbh, i dont think white women should adopt black children either. the child wouldnt get to experience their own culture and theyll grow up not loving themseleves cuz they dont have the beautiful feature of white women. trust me i been thru it
If I was the momma I would've beat that that lady's ahhhhh 😡
THIS PEOPLE WILL PAY.. REGARDLESS... THE LAND IS NOT YALS.... ANYWAAY, I DONT GET THESE SHOWS... THEY ARE DISRESPECTFUL TO OUR CULTURE.... FUCK THEM PERIOD!
Finally you are filming out of New Jersey... it was time it needed to be changed up and have some new scenery... ps no hate against nj
But luckily this is fake
I was 17k like and i would stop here
That was my child and a woman said that I'll be like that is so rude to my child😎
My cousin's friend is black with white parents (Trying not to be rude) But I don't judge just because they are a different race. Sometimes I either don't bring it up or just forget about it.
Like that's just rude to say
This made me cry
My mom experienced it on the day of 9/11  and three days after and we are Islamic that girl didn't like  here hijab she is still alive we where in canada
That elder lady the mean one is a bitch
That's dumb. So people really think that each race has to be raised in a specific way?
It doesn't matter what race the child is. The only thing that matters is the love that the child gets from the parent
Omg the lady make me cry too it's just so sad how some people in the world that have no idea that everybody is the same way. Don't judge people of how they look or what color they are or where they come from it doesn't matter God loves everybody no matter what
The little girl is adorable 😊
That first woman... damn. That is pure love right there. Her family in the 60's defended the black population and they  were shunned for it. \n\nGlad to see that she kept that love and threw away the hate
Oh god the first one made me cry 😭
I am wearing the same exact headphones as she is right now
4:27 is me when I hear my mum's car pull up, but I haven't brought the chicken out of the freezer!
i feel so bad for that first woman. she was so nice!
But also they rescue us so ty white paernts
The little girl is so cute
I live in North Carolina and I will say the area and school I go to some people will make it known what they are against whether u asked them or not
My mom is tan and i am  brown so is my dad
4:33 this man reminds me of my grandpa, he'd be calm and kind in any situation, and i miss him so damn much.
7:05 This man is the definition of awesome 👏
Lol omg the little girl has the same headphones as me xD
PREACH!!!!\nPRAYS THE LORDS IN DIFFERENT\nRACES! THE WORLD CHANGING WE DONT NEED RACISM IN OUR LIVES!!! LETS PRAY JESUS AND THE GODS!!!!!
this gives me faith in humanity💗
The girl that asked the question  is  reases
This has honestly happened before, I'm white and my blood related dad is black, I'm glad to see someone doing something about this.
Grandma in the corner xanned the fuck out
The little kid is so cuteeeee
Some of the ppl at my fucking school was bullying bc my mom was not black and my dad was  damn good thing i had friends to
Should've put Traci as the evil bitch....
black people has black wife's and black husband same as whites why judge please why this breaks my heart 💔💔😔
Morgan is the best actor ever
Seriously ITS JUST THE FRIKEN TONE OF SKIN
THOSE WORDS  no... she gave a home to a child for people who couldn't take care of her
Tbh I feel like no one really cares about race anymore.Aren't we all even?Most of the time.
The little girl in the thumbnail is my reaction the whole video even though I knew it was fake.
I would have punched a bitch worse case.  normal I would have cussed at her the ladies at the beginning were so freaking nice
The African American actress was my acting teacher. Her name is Jazelle and she is so sweet and kind and funny. I love her so much. I really miss her too. She works at Barbizon acting classes and I loved it there.
That is no fair I have a friend that is black and has white parents
And all of them actually
Cutest kid ever!!! SO CUTE!!😭❤️ i hope my baby in the future looks like her
So there is a both black and white Traci's?
I have been watching like 10 episodes I can't stop hahaha
It is horrible that the woman in the beginning went through that :'(
Who would dislike this.this is important either black/white/Chinese/Japan and anyone else skin color or not it's not ok to do this I love that people do care and do know not to jugde this is wat everyone should be like rescue every baby these people that r like black life's matter I'm black one,two its every life matters and if u agree like to get this out there I love everyone but everyone might not love me if their and nobody loves u I do everybody keep that in mind please
Oh I would of yelled at that person so bad if I heard that
Its like me and my mom in public. But, I actually came from her stomach
I pray for a day when racism doesn't exist.  Sadly I don't think it will happen within my lifetime but I pray for it nonetheless.
This scene made me cry, I'm in the process of adopting a black baby. I hope people are this nice.
I love how people stick up for each other it's real sweet
First Lady made me cried
Wtf am i doing i have an exam tomorrow...
If I was someone in that shop at the time I would go over to the lady who was being mean to the mother and the child I would have nock the hell out that lady. It does not matter is my mum was black I would still love her and two it's not nice and rude.
Little girl is a product of a woman who's addicted to black cock,
Morgan is cute
Posted on my birthday.
I wanna cry
WHERE IS TRACY?
#wwyd
#WHEREISTRACY
IB LEARNER PROFILES
Omg this is rasist #blacklivesmatter
Morgan is so adorable
Gotta love the elderly!
That bitch is racist
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Fuck me up too
I agree with the onlookers, white people cant make that kool aid. How are you going to support black children without kool aid. And there going to go bankrupt buying all that kfc.
We all are equal
Zayn you can do a movie my goodness
Never did I ever in my life think that these two people would sing together.....\n\n\n\n\n\nI LIVE FOR THIS PAIR

Did someone notice that the song is renamed?\nBefore it was Zayn,Sia-Dusk till dawn Ft Sia
Mark Webb who directed Amazing Spiderman is the one who direct this music video. OMG! it's like watching movie with Award-winning Singer on it! Just simply perfect. Well done!
The Best Song Ever
04:10 That part is everything...Girl Give Love To Your Body
Finally a girl who can keep up with his pitch and they could've done the video better.
the worst part of this song is at 5:37 😿😤
30k people really enjoyed the song that they missed the like button

malu ere el mejor#el mejor
Osea, ¿video negativo?
Cr7 paga impuestos :V Hijodepta
Canción del minuto 2:57 ?
Cr7 hizo hasta 6 😱
Que payasos los chilenos esos jaja
Jajajajajajaja Alexis Sánchez qlo
Que chilenos tan patéticos xDD
que se vaya a la mierda a cristiano
03:56 si llevan tiempo en el canal sabran que algunos millones personas hicierton una marcha pra que alexix dejara al arsenal y ahora a su novia?  solo para que ballan el 1% de los que quedaron
cual es la canción que suena en corto  2:58
cual es la canción que ponen al final?\nalguien me puede decir
Ese hijo de puta hablando de expulsiónes  del barsa y Madrid q no mame!!!! Los del Madrid son unos putos carniceros nomas por empezar porq no acabo, Ramos Casemiro y cuando estaba Pepe no se diga jajajjaja y en el barsa busquests así q no mame ese vergas hablador
Ya sabes el juego\n1messi\n2cristiano\n3suares\n4neymar\n5dybala\n6pogba\n7alexis\n8marcelo\n9pique
jajaj CR7 habla como retrasado, lleva ya años y años en España, país vecino de portugal, su lengua natal es mas parecida al español que al ingles, y aún así no sabe hablar. Me imagino que los abogados y fiscales se reían de las cosas y pretextos que decía CR7, por algo tiene esos juicios o audiencias, porque se detectó que no pagó al fisco y punto, más allá que diga que es un ignorante obtuso que solo sabe patear una pelota.
Con este hecho mas que claro que en chilehay puro simio deja que se juvilen sus actuales jugadores y lo único que tendrán para presumir son esas 2 copas y la goleada al peor México de la historia igual volverán a ser un equipo mediocre
Que estupido lo de la marcha sobre la chica de Alexis
Que manga de pajeros, con marchas le quieren manejar por segunda vez la vida a Alexis, si serán boludos
Like si lo viste después del partido
MANIPULADORES de la informacion\nPorque lo que el dijo que le gustaba mas Inglaterra porque aya nadie anda con pajas de quererse hacerse famoso con su nombre
Qué mal por lo de lewandowski :(
Y supongo que el problema de Piqué es Shakira
Una pregunta\nAlguien sabe cómo se llama la canción que suena al final de todos los vídeos
JAJAJAJA ESTOS CHILENOS YA NO SABEN QUE MAS INVENTAR O A QUIEN MAS ECHARLE LA CULPA...ENTIENDAN QUE NO SON LA MEJOR SELECCIÓN DEL MUNDO, A VECES, CUANDO ABRÍS MUCHO LA BOCA Y TE CREES MÁS DE LO QUE SOS, EL UNIVERSO SE ENCARGA DE PONERTE LOS PIES SOBRE LA TIERRA.
Haha ya no le dan Alexis
Que mal que no sepan distinguir bromas ... Las marchas son bromas ya que se vive en un país lleno de injusticias entonces para cada motivo se convocan a marchas.
Crack son lejos la actualidad que necesita un futbolero de lo q pasa en lo internacional, pero lo interno de cada país dejarlo ahí! Lo de alexis es una broma, es una idiotez q siquiera lo dejes para enjuiciar! Saludos desde chile. Es obvio q no se hará una marcha y solo para reírse.-
Jajajaj ustedes se lo creen todo , aqui en chile creamos eventos para solo reirmos o hacerlos virales no para ir en serio xd si ustedes ven el evento esta lleno de memes nada serio 😹
@cracks acá en chile hacen bromas con las marchas y protestas en Facebook jsjs
Excelente palabras de Cristiano para defenderse, no soy su fanboy ni de cerca, pero simplemente me parecio perfecto lo que dijo Cr7.
cuanta razón tiene cristiano wow reflexione mucho el mismo dijo que apenas tenía 6° grado de primaria un genio total con esfuerzo está donde esta hoy en día el mejor jugador del mundo
luego dicen que aqui no son chismosos en este canal..a la gente solo le interesa el futbol,no cuantos años cumple el niño de messi o si el feo de alixis tiene una novia rubia...bueno normal les encanta las telenovelas,,,,hablen de futbol carajo
No entiendo los no me gusta al video... , es un exelente trabajo de video e información exelente trabajo! CRACK!!!! Siempre me mantiene informado!
Esos que quieren que Alexis y su novia terminen son porque no tienen
Chilenos pendejos jajajajaja\nAlexis no tiene ritmo porque el muy pelotudo decidió no entrenar como protesta para que lo dejen ir al M.City.. La culpa es entera de el y no de la elfa con la que cosha..
Aquí la única noticia sobresaliente es que Benzema sea el 4to capitán de el real Madrid. No chinguen!!!
6to de primaria y yo aquí ganando salario mínimo hasta con la carrera :/ 
Como se llama la canción del final del vídeo? Like para que lo vean
Chilenos cagones 😂\nMira que echarle la culpa a un culito
Me parece que Cristiano pudo ser engañado, o que españa quiere sacarle dinero, soy Culé y me caerá mal por egolatra pero no creo que sea una mala persona y menos un defraudador de impuestos
Por eso admiro mucho a CR7 se sabe defender sabe jugar al futbol es el jugador perfecto que mas quiere la gente de el lo admiro lo amo
realmente que estupidez esa marcha...
En algunos paises organizan marchas para defender sus derechos y defenderse de los gobiernos...marchas por hambre..desempleo y muchas injusticias...los chilenos marchan para que un jugador deje a su novia?? Son tontos o que les pasa?
like 👍si quieres a lewandowski en el madrid!!
jaja una marcha para que alexis sanches deje a su novi. HAHA CE MAMO :V
Necesitamos que todos los grandes de Italia regresen a su nivel para que los jugadores de élite se quieran quedar. Aún recuerdo la época en la que todo jugador reconocido quería jugar en el calcio italiano.
Lewandowski al Madrid por favor
Cr7 el mejor de todos, me conmovió el comentario de que solo tiene hasta 6 año de escolaridad pero tiene el carácter de decirlo, no merece que en España y alrededor del lindo le tengan envidia y lo quieran ver hundido. Grande CR7 The Best
Que mamada lo de Alexis 😒😒😒😒😒
ahí está mourinho que más quieres para llevarte a cr7 de vuelta
gracias a dios que no se fue al UNITED hahaha
Me llegan Cracks y tienen razón wow me llega todo sus noticias del fútbol sigan así u no falten siempre sigan informando todo
es una puta locura tener que pagar 14 millones de impuestos en 3 años...
Si es cualquier que los jugadores tienen que andar pagando una ofortuna para andar en un país son cualquiera
con esa mujer, yo tambien tendria bajo rendimiento
Me da pena Cristiano. Sus Asesores muy mal. Obviamente como uno no sabe no entiende.
Alguien sabe como se llama la cancion de fondo que sale al final del video?
Quien va a ir a perder el tiempo a esas marchas, solo es una broma, es  webeo.
Amigo,no tienes que decir Cristiano así defendió su inocencia se dice así defendí su supuesta inocencia por qué no sabes si culpable o no
Manu es solo ironía de nosotros los chilenos, esa marcha que se menciona es solamente para la risa, nadie va a estar marchando por estar en contra de la novia de alexis😂😂😂
Que pasa con la voz de cracks mx manu brabo
se ven pendejos los madridistas diciendo que los afectan los albritos cuando claramente son unas cochinas, cerdas y sucias fauleras. solo es para justificar su mala racha. NO SOY CULE por si lo piensan
y la deja es un tarado no tiene la culpa. el equipo son 11 no 1 jajaja
Quiero que mi argentina clasifique al mundial :
La Marcha!! \nQue termine luego él culiao con mayte
A pesar de todo siempre caballero Cr7
La verdad es una persecución tremenda en España hacia los futbolistas.la parte donde cristiano dice que solo tiene 6° de escuela me dio directo en el kokoro
La cancion del corto es down for the long run cospe remix:)
Like si quieres que CR7 se valla a inglaterra
Que pelotudos los Chilenos pensando que el problema es la novia cuando Chile nunca jugo bien lo poco que tiene lo robo
Anda que manda huevos que los del Madrid se quejen de los árbitros...
Like si cristiano es inocente
alguien q me diga como se llama la cancion q empieza en el minuto 2:27
Q chistosa la marcha pero puta... es puro webeo po obvio jajaja aguante el crack estamos recién a septiembre  queda mucho
la justicia de España esta bien cabrona  primero Messi y Neymar   y ahora CR7  porque no  hacen lo mismo con jugadores  sin chavos :v
Soy del Barça pero creó que la política y la prensa son una mierda y pues si Cristiano es inocente esperó que todo acabé bien Visca al Barça
Like y hacemos una marcha para la marcha que le harán a Alexis JAJAJA xdXd.
Estuvieron fuertes los temas de este video, gracias Manu
Marcha para que Manu entienda el Chiste de las Marchas xD
cracks necesito como se llama la cancion que utilizan cuando van hablar en corto
Jueguen limpio, y no les expulsaran a ninguno en Madrid!!
0:50 al menos es sincero >:v
Veni, 6to año de escolaridad? Eso es el ultimo año de la secundaria o el primero? Me sorprende bastante el nivel académico de los futbolistas
Ahahahahaahahahhhh
millions to play tennis...yet people making breakthroughs in cancer research get 20k a year....makes a man put a gun to his head hahahahahahahahahahha
When I die. I want to come back as a killer whale.
That minke whale is like a guy wearing a Trump shirt in Berkeley.
That Minke was probably thinking, Fins; don't fail me now!
Check out the song  David Attenborough https://youtu.be/kR59j6AgV30
I think it's time for killer whale to extinct! Too much damage too many of them are out there! Let's kill them all
This is why you don't get in the water with killer whales.  They aren't your friend.
I know the history of the name Killer Whale but I think we should name them by their scientific name; Orca. Orcas are beautiful creatures and mean no harm to humans. I know as I have dived with them on many occasions in New Zealand, Norway and the UK. The name Killed Whale strikes fear and makes people think of them as destructive murderers when really they're benevolent and only hunt specifically.
One of the best footages of 2017
Thank you @BBC Earth. I did not know this happens in the nature. I learn something new today.
My dogs will love an appetizer
Christ Almighty, they're not whales, they're orca or giants of the dolphin genre.
It's really annoying that the killer whales seemingly never fail. I'd like to see something get away for once lol
That's what Trump wants to do to the Mexicans, Black's, Jewish, Women, Muslims, and non-racist Americans
The feminist killers be wantin' the same size dorsal fin as the males.
Humans are the only predator who roots for the underdog.  All other predators kill and eat the underdog.  Just so you know, we got empathy along with religion, music, a few other things about 80,000 years ago.  Without it, uncle jon with the broken leg wouldn't be helped-who in turn helped back when the leg healed.
Very good footage, especialy for me, that loves Cetaceans. They are just M A J E S T I C .I cant even have a favorite species.. \nAll cetaceans are cool on their own way: \n\nOrcas are Huge predators but wont prey on humans for some reason.\nBowheads can live up to 200 years and they live on cold polar waters.\nBlue Whales are the biggest animal that ever lived and its vocalization is deafening.\nSperm whales can dive very deep to search for food, sleep verticaly and use sonar to see when there is no light.\nHumpbacks jump over the water, dance with its mate and have the most beautiful vocalization, almost like singing.\nThe List Goes On...\n\nCetaceans are something special.
Where are Paul Watson and the Sea Shepard when you need them?
and the PG BBC strikes again
Enjoyed the video!
Cruel world
Forget Shark Week... there needs to be a Killer Whale week!!!!
Killer Whale is a perversion of Whale Killer
Orcas have big jaws with large teeth yet they don't initiate their attack with bites, i guess that's because they don't have claws to grab their prey or pin them down like big cats.  Water is just air, and ocean mammals are quite slippery too, or maybe orcas are gentlemen and ladies, they don't want to dine like thugs like hyenas lol.
The wolfs of the sea🤘🏼
Oh Minke, you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind, hey Minke!
It's amazing. Killer Whales are truly the apex predators of the sea, because they have no natural predators (not including humans). They are so intelligent, and are even more intelligent than our own dogs and even some apes. \n\nSad that we have to imprison them in asylums for our entertainment.
The way orcas hunt is scary but  it's an incredible footage. Circle of life.😑
Finally Type A Orca get some recognition
Where is the under water cam when you need one
Does your minky have a license?
Orcas literally operate in gangs and jump other whales. Break yo self!
2:06 - 2:12 When everybody goes to the gorge on Karelia in War Thunder Ground Forces
well, you know what they say about whales with big fins...
Could you see a Rainbow 4:13 ? 😲😵\nOn the left side
Beautiful. I love when animals act like animals. Now if we can just get people to be more human; that's would be worth a 5min video.
I ❤ Attenborough's narration. Whatever he does, its natural. I think he did for pocoyo, didn't he?
This is how nature balance its self
Strange, the killers never intended to eat the minke.
baby minke + easy to  kill - orcas like us are lazy :) -- adults too much work
Way cool
Don't worry Guys, the killer whales are only doing scientific research
Seagulls and sea birds should be referred to as sea vultures
This video edit sucks!\n\n Were are the Ariel shots???
I'm more concerned on how cold the water is
where were the mikne crew?
If I was the minke I was stop and go for the male 1v1 me broooooo
Evil exists in nature, who creatures nature is god, so god is evil
These prey animals have no sense of pride. I would have biten the fin or tail off one of the orcas. At least you take some out before you go.
Hungry Beasts 😂 but no matter what I would still love nature ❤
4:36 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, Minke!!!!!!!! -_-.
Wheres Uncle Omar-- Tragic! Just Tragic!
ohh poor Minkie 😔
I wish Japanese ate killerwhales 🇯🇵
HUMANS R SO EVIL!!1!!!!1!!11
4:12 that rainbow tho
But whale hunting is illegal!  Someone should arrest these orcas and turn them into vegans.
I reall hope there will be 4k content in this channel.
David Attenborough his voice is so profound
No justice in nature.
They weren't this scary at the SeaWorld...crazy
Green Peace shall protest against this cruelty. Down with the killer whales and sea gulls!
Why did the BBC not intervene? Humans should provide food for all wildlife to prevent this from happening
People have no empathy for animals. They're all caught up in their narrative.
I love orcas so much!
MashAllah
i dont blame them. having lived with innuits and eaten minke.....\nits like beef of the ocean. so tender though...\n\nseriously its like red meat but as soft as fish.... innuits eat the fat too... that just tastes like fishy greasy fat.\n\nbut the meat? 10/10. im with the killers on this 1
Who saw those sea creatures at 2:01
Why dont they bite it to death instead of racing for 2 hours?
This commentator can give life to a standing still vase on kitchen table !! 👌
Why doesn't the Minke whale dive deep?
You know what they say, the bigger the dorsal fin..
What a happy ending!
I really like your videos, but would be nice if they would have subtitles, English subtitles I mean. Thank you.
Hey we should put those killer whales in tanks and swim with them!
3:36 Aw, he dead
RACE WAR
Genius ....
Aw1800ful.
Beautiful!!!
:(
Seems wrong.
Killer whales are not whales, mate. 0:37
For me Sir David Attenborough 😎👍🇬🇧🌴🐪👀🍨⛳️️
tear...for the minki
Circle of life! 🐳
God I love Orcas
ORCAS******
animal cruilty
Wow that was amazing
4:13 Random rainbow.
They sound like giant killer squeak toys.
I LIKE FUZZY WHALE
Nice video ❤️🤗😍💋🤗❤️❤️
Lol those two penguins/seals at 2:00
Absolutely beautiful...
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
#EarthGoHard
Orcas are just as vicious underwater as the wild dogs on the land. 😪
Does anyone else just hate the way killer whales kill their prey?  It's just so sad
Orcas are dolphins not whales  Mike drop
OH MY GOD FUCKING ROAST ME QUEEN!!!! YES!!

PIE EATING CONTEST WITH BEN
90% of views by Leeds fans.
Fuckin dreadful. Left at 9 and got back at 9 to travel there, spent at least £60 just to get that in return. Players need to show some fight.
Leeds were class tbf
#21 on trending lmao\n\nLeeds would have taken more though
Lmao thanks for playing in the championship lads, been a pleasure all the best for your survival
This is the year then! MOT!
We played you off the pitch but its a long season, really hope you guys stay up
I just don't see why Clough plays defensive. When we play defensive, we let them have shots. When we let them have shots, they have goals. When they have goals, Leeds happens. Playing defensive against big teams just isn't gonna work. He needs to look at Newcastle and Huddersfield and see what their doing right
why is this trending?
Sorry lads but we tanned you.
Worst team I've seen at Elland Road in years
2-1 last season though wasn't it Leeds lads. Fair play, battered us. But we're in a relegation dog fight. Not overly arsed about getting points off you lot, though it'd obviously be nice.
Northampton here. Why is this on trending? 😂
Can't believe I went couldn't even pass to each other fucking embarrassing
Why was there like, 12 fans for Burton?
Sack clough and let me be manager
Consider this revenge for the 2-1 defeat last season. That being said, all the best for the season Burton, hopefully a one of game for you.
Would you talk something about the new iPhone?
I like that your reviews actually don't bore me! 👍
Hey Austin this is guy's!
I have an Huawei p8 lite, and here in Uruguay it costs around 200 dollars and the Alcatel is better, yeah, I live in the third world.
Austin is now (probably) recording/uploading a video about IShit X or 8 (Iphone X or 8)
TWO FOR$85!! TWO FOR $85!!\nSTOP MAKING PEOPLE THAT WORK THERE (ME) SELL LESS SMH.
*chough* *chough*\n*Apple*
Do a video over a 1000$ gaming laptop vs like 9000$ gaming laptop vs a gaming PC please\n\nLike if you want to see it!:D
When a 80$ phone has a headphone jack but a 500$+ phone doesn't? Something is wrong
Austin answering the doorbell:\nHey guys, this is Austin.
i love the way he says Hey guys this is Austin!\nkeep rocking the enthusiasm m8!
Next challenge .. 80 dollars radio
i have a LG G3 Stylus for 120€ (im from Germany) over a year now and... its enough for me, i like it and the buttons are placed perfect!
This phone cost less than my lunch XDDDD
He sounds like a Fagget . HHey ! Guyyys thisss isss Austinnn..
Follow me on instagram @victorandres_37 and I follow you back
Can you plz do a reveiw for the Asus chromebook flip.
This is why we don't get invited oh man...I cant 😂😂😂😂
hey austin, this is guys.
Austin which types of comments you mostly reply . do you reply any of the comment on youtube
I am watching on an 80$ lg triibute and it is equaly as good as iphone5s
If you want any budget device just fly around on AliExpress n get yourself a decent looking Android phone that sends all your data to some random company in China 😁
I know it's late but\nSorry for your house :/
try heroes and castles 2, this game will destroy entry level socs like the snapdragon 400s and some low level 600s
so can it game. welllll, for the price, yes. but not compared to something im much more used to seeing that would usually appeal to the upper middle class to upper class citizens that my reviews are usually centered towards. these tech youtubers need to lower their standards a bit.
I've got an Alcatel pop 4 .It's pretty good for 70 quid. This a30 fierce is markedly better. Better camera for sure
My LG l Bello is horse shit compared to this Alcatel \n(it was also 120€ more expensive)
Austin Evans would you please tell me a price range of what you make on youtube? I would like to know because im trying to prove to somebody you can actually make money off of youtube for a job. And i am graduated and im getting in trouble for playing too much. Please respond in anyway shape or form this may also be a private reply. Just please reply. I understand if you do not reply at all.
Why are you in this commercial
I have a 80$ smartphone it works fine and a 40 and it is Conpletley fine
Why would anyone use a fingerprint device - might as well just give your fingerprint to Google and the rest of the world. Stupid people - don't you KNOW by now Google records Everything?
Hey Austin this is guys. But what do you guy Austin think?
Try the ouktiel u20 plus, 1080 res. Dual camera and 5.5 inch display and fingerprint
For some reason it doesn't look look like it's 80$
An 80$ Phone has more functions than a 1000$ Iphone
Dude looks tired as fuck.\nGet some rest.
I had an earlier version or the Fierce, it was pretty decent, just didn't like the display brightness
Mine was 50, does It's job.
I take this one any day over the Galaxy Note 8 ore IPhone 8 plus \nI'm serious
I've played this challenge my whole life... because I'm poor
This is why we don't get invited\n-Savage Kenny
its better then my 130$ samsung galaxy core prime...\nI got 8GB of ram, no apps can be stored on the SD card, only songs, around 5gb of the storage is taken up by the phones unremoveabe applicaions,  so I have about 3gb to download apps, it has a 480p screen\n\n\n\nIT HAS A 480p SCREEN\n\n\ndo NOT get the samsumg galaxy core prime
Try just having a smart phone worth $50 now $38 for five years...
Where is the link to UK store to buy?
Hey Austin, this is guys
Better than a flagship phone from 4 yrs ago.
hey guys I'm exhausted
Same price as a old note4..which is still amazing today.
I don't see the big deal.  My Nokia 3300 still works just fine.
Instead of using real racing 3 use csr2 it has better graphics
How was this a challenge I don’t mean to be mean but this is very grateful a lot of people don’t even have friends or have a little tiny flipphones America is very lucky
Trying way to hard to flex bud
Challenge? This is better than my phone.
Haha there's a 30 dollar phone out there
But does it run the latest version of android? \n\nIf not then this is like almost every other unpopular cheap android phone. In the sense that it can't update. If it does update and has an unlocked version then I'm sold.
You should do a zenfone 3 zoom review.
can u do a review on the zte blade z max
Is Austin Evans Worth it in 2017??\n\n\n\n( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
because it's $80 and you reviewed it, it's probably gonna sell out quick...
This is a challenge? I've been doing the $80 phone challenge for the past 5 years
A head phone jack! Has more features than an iPhone 7 for a 10th of the price
It was my b day yesterday
This costs less than my S8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery month
I was using a£70 phone for months and it was more than fine
MY PHONE COST LIKE 400 DOLLARS WHEN IT WAS NEW 2 YEARS AGO... IT HAS 2 GB RAM, 16 GB STORAGE, QUAD CORE 1.2 GHZ PROCESSOR, 5 INCH SCREEN 720P. DANG. Well, at least it isn't plastic.
How is this supposedly a challenge?
Howd u gor mk x ?\nI got the s7 cant find it in store
You structure your sentences kind of strange and put weird inflections in your voice at seemingly random spots in your sentences.  Very unique, I guess that's probably why you do it.
...why would you take a fast photo of a celeb? So random.
Hey guys this is austin and it's really exhausting.
Do I the Mac mini is worth it
I was gonna rule this out till you said 32 gigs...I'm SOLD
Hey guys this is austin ™️

when she said this is me....I knew what she meant I knew exactly about that painful release....I'm so glad it's over J you are free! now Slay like you do!!!!!!!
She sounds like Michael.
Heartbreaking to see her break down. The song must have incredibly personal layers to it, all the more now than before.
Thanks sooo much for uploading. Can't wait to see her in Dec
Respect to Mrs. Jackson for being so honest and showing she is only human.\nLove her!
WE LOVE U JANET. IT'S GONNA BE OK.
Wow!! I was getting emotional too. I felt her pain.
Wait what....did she say this is me at the end!???
I commend her for leaving that toxic marriage. 🖕Domestic violence
Her ex husband beating her at every stage of her marriage, i.e. The different shape of the girls body. She had the courage to break the cycle. Her life with him in song.
U R the Queen Of POP Ms. Jackson
I felt that and cried with her. I love you Janet!!!
Oh yeah Queen Janet spilled tea by adding this song to the set list...Wissam if I ever see you, you gon get these hands, you evil muthafucka! Glad she got out of it with the baby she's always wanted and MEGA coins to boot!!!
Poor Janet, that really pissed me off seeing her sad. Keep Raising girl! Welcome home!
I LOVE YOU JANET JACKSON!!! Any man should be treating you like gold.
this was in Houston, TX..I was there....it was good💖
Loud & clear! Sometimes verbal & emotional abuse can cause more damage than physical. Though a beautiful child came from this union, it's even more heartbreaking knowing that one is tied to the other person for life. There is a God & He sees everything. Much Love Janet & understanding.
It gone be alright trust God Janet he will keep you .
It's an emotional song already and add her raw emotions to it only intensified the pain. Her brother Randy has said her husband was emotionally abusive, I guess she couldn't hold it in. You're Free now Ms. Jackson ♡
am I the only person hearing echo of MJ in her voice? The crying part? Too much is going on in her life: very hormonal: she's a 1st time and new mom at age 50!...Motherhood can wreck your emotions up to 1yr after giving birth....+divorce + gruesome schedules of a world tour! Real shit!\n❤❤❤❤ to you Janet , in my humble opinion her #1 priority: take GOOD CARE of yourself! Fame and money are secondary....
Damn 😪 I'm glad she was strong enough to walk away.
Wow amazing! We love you Janet. So powerful! #janfam #jtribe
Yes Janet get the messages out
It's going to be alright love God got u,I jus read what Randy wrote about this moment she going through it I love u Janet God gets the last word u will come out bigger and better 🙏🙏🙏🙏💜💜💜💜
Very touching subject. happens too often to many women.
It hurts my heart to see her break down and cry. I truly understand her pain of having to divorce a man you truly cared about. She's my Sheroe... she's human too...we all go through things....
I wonder whether she has postpartum depression
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS NEVER 😞KAY! FREE YOSLF QUEEN JANICE JACKSON! SANG THRU THE PAIN SISTAH, RELEASE ALL OF IT & U ARE NOT ANYONE'S DORMAT!❤💖💓💗💜   I'M GLAD 2 👀 U DOING WHAT U WORKED HARD 4 & YOSECOND LOVE PERFORMING, I BELIEVE YO1ST LOVE IS YO BABYBOI WHO LOVES U UNCONDITIONALLY! ❤🌟💃💙
did she make this with her first husband
I totally felt this pain!
I hope the guy she threw done on the ground is ok lol.
💜💯
4:07 So sad. Touched my heart. We love you Janet.
December 17, Atlanta , Phillips Arena  ( Her  FINAL  stop  on  37  city  tour !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! )
Everytime I see this video and hear this song I cry.  The performance is electrifying....
He had her dressed up like Batman all that time with his sick ass
This song was on The Velvet Rope album so it came out in like, '97.
#WeLoveJanet
Thanks Janet for showing love to Htown. Florida gone need some love too. Stay blessed!
Janet has so many great unreleased tracks that she could release a greatest hits album of them, and this would be in the top 3 songs that she never officially released.  Trust a Try, Enjoy, and This Body that Loves You are 3 others she should have released.
I am so sorry Janet, You will be back in love soon with Me
She left him ,good now her son won't see that shit happen to his Momma!Love you Janet.You are totally doing the right thing!I was with a man that broke my nose ,and pulled me by the hair just to slam my head on floor gave me a concussion! Worst time of my life .So when I seen this  brought me back.I started tearing up too cause I know.Thank you Janet for showing me that I am NOT alone.Much love!(I am no longer with him)
Супер песня.Жизненная
Unbelievable ❤️
💚🤦🏼‍♀️
I'm crying too omg
leave that demon alone. #Nocontact
Bravo Janet Jackson
Can't wait to see her November 16th.
Men are victims of abuse too. Problem is, our gynocentric, man-hating, feminist society prefers catering to the issues and needs of girls and women, while routinely overlooking/ignoring/pooh-pooing the issues boys and men are plauged with. In case you weren't aware, the male homeless and suicide rate is FAR higher than it is for women, and 40% of the victims of domestic abuse and sexual assault are men. This goes for both gay and straight men.
Le falta carne :/
Wow. He's got Freddie down.
Get the oscar spot ready on the Mantle
Lagrimón! Pero que alguien le cambie la peluca a Roger, por favor.
Exagerada la actuacion de los puñetazos al principio
It's Rami voice? Really good voice!
OMG, MI CORAZÓN, JODEEER.
Un poquito exagerado los movimientos diria yo....
Nice work camera man, really feels like the era before camera stabilization
Really?? Now they're making movies about this punk??
Muchooooo éxito 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
Lo que está claro es que esto ya tiene forma por fin. Y en cuanto estos vídeos que seguramente saldrán más no hay que hacerles mucho caso, ya que en una película hay miles de tomas que finalmente no salen ella, (espero que esta sea una de ellas). El único que no se parece tanto es Freddie, los demás prácticamente son igualitos. Habrá que esperar el resultado final, no es lo mismo verlo desde la grabación de un móvil y desde una distancia a verlo en el cine con las mejores cámaras y el mejor audio.
Bisogna lasciare assolutamente la voce di Freddie ,non c è niente di meglio che la sua voce in quella giornata.\nBisogna poi non concentrarsi troppo su questa esibizione, che è stata forse la più iconica di sempre, semplicemente unica così come è\nMercury è inimitabile o si va ancora più nei dettagli e si rasenta la perfezione o i fan di Fred ,che sono fan attentissimi e che ci tengono molto ,troveranno il tutto una scimmiottatura, attenta produzione, il confine fra un capolavoro e un flop mai come in questo caso può essere sottile !!
He looks good but he also looks like he has a weird giant head.
wow I have never said this about a biopic before, but I'm looking forward to this
Sounds just like him
he's got the look down. and the shimmy, haha
That's a lovely lovely voice. Rami's gonna nail it.
I HOPE THE FREDDIE MOVES ARE GETTING SMOOTHER....TOO CHOREOGRAPHED.
😘😘😘😘el mejor Fredy Mercury 😘😘😘
Luke Spiller would have been a better choice.
I m gonna cry my lung out..my freddie ..why did u left angel.
Videos like this make people cringe from wanting to see them! Crappy sound, windy, blurry, shaky, bullshit!!!!
Eu achei que ficou bom, mas ficou meio que exagerado nas atuações de Rami. Mas ficou legal
Me parece que a Rami le falta un poco de musculatura y no exsagar tanto en lo movimientos . Bueno en realidad me parece que lo estoy comparando demasiado con Freddie y nadie lo va a poder igualar, nisiquiera en su forma de moverse en el escenario.
SPETTACOLARE
Wow!
wow!!!!!!
Buenazo
Damnn!
O DIOSSSS❤❤❤❤❤😍👍👍
para mi esta bien,nadie nunca va a igualar al gran freddie pero para la movie sivesta pasable mucha suerte la espero ansiosa.
Gran impresión del Live Aid
Suerte mucha suerte,Que nadie olvide  al Gran Freddie
Al principio no pensé que fueran los dobles 😝😝 están geniales estoy sorprendida 😘😘😘
Por fin se hará realidad 😭😭 mucha suerte a Rami y al resto de la producción!! 🙌🙌🙌🙌
marc martel
WOW!
Fix the teeth.  Freddie was no Bugs Bunny; he was Freddie Mercury AND PLEASE rent a hose so Malek can appear to be the Persian Popinjay!  Also, Malek will need to incorporate Freddie's fierce expression at times or it wont work.
This was obviously centered on Rami and his playing of Freddie but for the few moments we saw the other members they all have their guys down pat. That John Deacon bow was spot on.
esa es la voz de marc martel, tal vez esté colaborando con la pelicula
Los criticos somos nosotros los fans espero q sea gran pelicula no un negocio saludos amigas y amigos
Nos quejamos durante años porque este proyecto no avanzaba, y una vez que se vuelve real, empiezan a criticar todo. Encima es solo un detrás de escena, ni siquiera se sabe si es una toma que va a quedar. Sean más contemplativos, queridos.
Joder, que buenas carcajadas me he aventado con esto, los movimientos si son exagerados creo que hasta yo lo puedo mejorar, ahí hace falta practicar, por cierto Rami usa unos pantalones acampanados fuera de moda muy setenteros...Los de Freddie no eran así, la forma de moverse de John Deacon bien despreocupado va y toma su instrumento jaja y Roger ese peluquín(se ve de lejos) y medio enano al parecer tiene que dar grandes saltos hasta la batería para llegar, espero cambien esos detalles en la película final.
Was is sped up? If not then it looked really bad.i mean look at what he's doing with his arms. Looks like sieg heil. There is no fines in how he moves. Really really bad acting.
I'M CONFUSED. IS RAMI SINGING OR MARC MARTEL?
hope theres plenty of gay club action
Rami did a really good job, but if they were filming, I'd recommend doing it again, honestly. He needs to move a bit more like Freddie, he puts his shoulders up a little to much and the timing was a bit bad.
This is the era where people watching directly not thru camera phone.
Peter thanks for having me on, this was a lot of fun and of course it was a pleasure singing with you! You're the man - Ant
I died at the ptx bit
Broadway pretty much just sounded like Glee. Pretty much should have been called Glee. Also, the dudes are seriously hot. Holy crap.
still, original is the best
I s c r e a m e d  a t  t h e  P e n t a t o n i x  p a r t
Just... more, please... gib moar xD This was all kinds of amazing.
this has to be one of my most favorite video!!
watching this i'm like oh this is good then pentatonix style comes up and i completely lost it bwahaha best avi impersonation!
I love the Country version,
THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER!
Opera is the best!
bruh I need the full skyrim version of shape of you 😂
The whitecre is so accurate, haha
During the metal part, Peter Hollens looked at him like, Dude, what the f*** is wrong with you.
Peter! You should do a song with Natewantstobattle! Please it would be awesome!
HELLO FROM INDONESIA\nAND YOURE ON THE NEWS LOL\nTHIS VIDEO DESERVE MORE VIEWS TBH
The metal one though 😂
Someone show this to Ed Sheeran!!!!!! :O
Can you please sing You Know Better Than I from the movie Joseph, The King of Dreams?
You should do a cover of 5000 Candles in the Wind from Parks and Rec
Omg I died at the PTX section. So funny! Love it!
I love you Peter
the country is my favorite
Loved it! OMG - so amazing!  You are both winners but I'm sorry the Metal was my fav
i think everyone wins with this
HAHAHA, I don't think I will ever be able to unsee Blue wig Peter. That picture has now marked my brain forever.
Loved it! So good and Peter you win in my books! Can't wait to hear more like this! Very well done!
Im the only one who came for mariachi??
Please do something of hozier, love your work either way
Hey Peter, can you do Walk On Water by 30 Seconds to Mars Please? I would love to hear it.
One song I'd like to see: The Song of Ornn https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e47AEBnu9SQ\n\nPreferably in the original lyrics, but english lyrics would be awesome too
Josh Groban Van Morrison were the best! In my opinion.
Skyrim.
Omg lovley😂😍 haha perfect pentatonix 😂😂😂 more off these
Broadway n ptx style 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
PTX ❤️
Danny eleman
Skyrim won, skyrim SKYRIM SKYRIM!!!!
DANNY ELFMAN OH MY GOD
Hey PTX
Metal killed me XD
are\nare those staples easy buttons
pentatonix is a genre?
Skyrim style seriously xD thankyou so much!
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!!!
Pentatonix!!!👏👏💗💖
This was awesome. I especially liked the country one
I now really want peter to do i got friends in low places for some reason.
My favourite is country
Peter, as always I loved your video!  I would very much enjoy watching a cover of another of Josh Groban's songs or Andrea Bocelli, you definitely have the voice for it. Perhaps Caruso? That would be incredible, especially if someone like either Tina Guo or Taylor Davis featured in it!
I thought you both did great, so I can't decide who won (I'm a undesided person, sorry) though I have to say, I thought the Metal was a bit much. But other than that, Peter, Anthony great job. I would like to see a cover video of an 80's song that can't get enough of. It's called Ride Like the Wond by Christopher Cross.
i love how Skyrim is a genre 😂😂😂
You should make more like this
Omg love it!!!❤️❤️❤️ you guys are awesome, I was smiling al the way through😊❤️
I love this video soooooo much I can't even vote!!! Both of your voices are super amazing!!!! You, Peter have inspired me to keep on singing with my brother. Thank you immensely from the bottom of my heart!!!! :)
Would love to see  you do either Never Be the Same or Not Alone by red in the different Genres
Hello, Mr Hollen\nI'm a French fan, and I would ask you somthing: can you sing a French song ? If you can't, it's Ok, but I would realy love to  listening it.\nIf you can, can you sing Hugues Aufrey's  Santiano? Thank you very much for it, and good luck for the next ^o^
I was enjoying it until they parodied my favourite band
There needs to be a full cover of the Frank Sinatra Genre, That was seriously awesome.
Opera: Italian! lol is the translation correct? Someone tell me plz!
Ten second song! is the best! ♥
The next song you should do is if im lucky
Ooh, this is freaking AWESOME! :D\nYou both won ;)\nYou are both amazing artists and both the video itself and the singing is just genius :)\n\nTo those reading this comment: please check out my channel. I upload singing covers and would love to get more views and comments.\nMuch love and light <3
I really liked the Chant version. Also Country, EDM and Skyrim.
2:14 Peter and i have he same reaction xDDD
You guys should make a full country remix I would listen to that
Your italian isn't so good..but you are fantastic together. Specially on PTX genre. :)
Oh my. I really love your Pentatonix version. And i dont think i am the only one who waited for some Home Free action in the Country part. :D
Pentatonix is a genre now and I love it.
It's too funny
n o w  m y  b e d  s h e e t s  s m e l l  l I k e  y o u .
Anthony? You here?! Peter! You will have to explain... how come? Wow!! Cool!!
Please do Evermore from the new Beauty and the Beast!
My fave was the country genre!! Sounded like it could have been the original song! :)
I think Peter won. The heavy metal threw me off
Please make a Dear Evan Hansen cover of Waving Through a Window or For Forever seems right up your alley
I got surprised with PTX! It was unexpected !
Peter Hollens, can you do Lili Marlene? It's my favorite song, and my great grandfather and I used to sing it together when I was a child. He used to sing it as well with his men during WW2 a lot. You can choose between the original German version or sing it in English of course. There are also two ways to sing it, either a more slow and sad solo or a duet that's much more upbeat and happy. Much care from Deutschland! Love your work and thank you! There is the Marlene Dietrich 1915 version, and then there's a 1939 version, plus the versions out there of soldiers singing it. It's in a bunch of different languages too like English, German, French, Italian, Russian, and Japanese.
HAHAHAHAHA SKYRIM

Your skins amazing! The makeup really compliments you it's beautiful on
Your skin looks amazing! You just aren't used to this look but it's so nice to switch it up. Isn't that the point of makeup? 🙂✨ Seems like Riri was tired of the trends and just focused on glowy skin for everyone and quality products without overcharging. Thanks for your review! Big fan!! 💕
I think you look GORGEOUS and glowy!
WHEN YOU OPENED THE BLUSH AND HIGHLIGHT DUO, I WENT BLIND FOR A FEW SECS
Absolutely stunning as always! love how it still looks wet even tho it's matte
Ur accent is everything!!! And ur so beautiful!!
Did your purple wash out or did you get it touched up? just curious because i loved the purple and want to try!
I love your excitement for it! This review was super helpful for me!
what foundation color is this? someone please help me :)
I just saw your video along with others giving a review on Rihanna's product. A girl from my town decided to go into porn and now I see where she got the name! Lmao I'm so serious Genevieve Sinn is her porn name.
Gorgeous! Able to leave your shade etc in the description next time ❤️?
A B S O L U T E L Y flawless!
I've got a bloody wedding dress to buy lmfao priceless! Love you 😍🙌🏼
Just started my channel. 🍾\n\nWatch my new video! 😁and subscribe!    \n\nPlease and thanks 🙏 💖\n\n✌️
Love this!!! I'm so sad it's not out near me yet! I have a hard time finding a good matte foundation because I am naturally VERY oily. Super stoked to try this once it's in my area.
You look like my weee cousin. Mad
YOU'RE A GODDESS 😍
I just absolutely love watching you! So beautiful and real!
I don't even have to watch this video to tell you if it's worth it. Girl is that description a joke? 😹😹😹 HELL MF YES IT IS WORTH IT!
My goodness, your skin looks AMAZING! This line is definitely something that will have to go on my wishlist <3
Im in love with ur accent new subbie alert 🚨
Your face/skin looks amazing your makeup looks amazing as well beautiful.
I didn't want to buy any of this until I saw this video.. the foundation looks Amazing 😍
Totally shocked that there's only ONE lippie!
I think everything looks great on you!! I saw sooo many people gathered around the Fenty Beauty display at Sephora today so I havent gotten a chance to browse it yet. You've got me excited to try it!!! You look beautiful❤❤
This is the best I have ever seen your skin! It looks so beautiful!
I think this is a nice brand and the foundation is great for people who like/prefer matte finish. You just rock the dewy look, Jamie!! Im the same way! I love my oils, my natural/satin/dewy finishes and i have been loving Cover Fx illuminating setting mist😍 you should try it. Love the highlighter, i bought trophy wife today. Gonna use it as eyeshadow. Thanks for this review!
I REALLY love this look on you!
JAAAMIIIEEE you look STUNNING! The lipgloss is gorgeous on you! Also your skin is amazing right now.
New subscriber - love how this looks on your skin.  It looks dewy and flawless even though it sounds like it feels otherwise.  I've watched a couple of other reviews of the products and that's how I found you.  That seems to be a commonality.  What it feels like vs what it looks like are two different things though the matte feeling wasn't described as bad.  It sounds great for oily or combo skin but mine is super dry so I'm thinking there is no way it will work on me.
How did I miss this 😍😍😍
Your skin...holy shit 😍😫 it is as plump and clear as an angels bum!!
One of the best face looks you've done in my opinion 🙌🏽🙌🏽 you always look beautiful but the blends are so nice and natural! Enough bronzer blush everything so pretty! 😚😚😚💅🏽💅🏽💅🏽
Amazing video !!! I just subscribed!!! I've been watching YouTube for years and never came across your videos before  .. I'm Canadian and actually living in Glasgow at the moment with my Scottish hubby 😊. So love you even more that you're Scottish! 😉👌🏻Have fun wedding dress shopping!!! X\nI'm definitely going to Harvey Nic's tomorrow in Edinburgh so spend all my money on Fenty haha
Ok. So i hadnt heard anything at all about this collection and Im not particularly a huge fan of Rihanna.  But OMG! you look gorgeous. When i saw the thumbnail i clicked on it immediately because i had to know what was on your face. You look so breath taking. Also i think you look so glowy and it made me laugh that you said you werent used to being so matte. Lol but anyways you look amazing.
Does anyone know if the foundation would be any good for dry skin??? The struggle is so real finding a foundation that works with my crusty ass face ( I have good skin care I just have dry skin :( )
Why does she look different in the thumbnail ¿ Not saying it in a bad way she's absolutely beautiful but I'm just curious 🤷🏻‍♀️💗
Jamie do you have a tutorial with makeup for humid weather?
can't stop looking at your dingly earring. The mixture of earrings and piercings you have with your hair looks so fucking good. I want a dingly earring
This is honestly the best your skin has ever looked! It always looks good, but looks amazing here! Love the lip look way better than a liquid lip - looks like your natural lips but better. Also the gold higlighter looks crazy wearable and gorgeous.
Skin looks gorgeous i think! Loved this review
Jamie💛💖💛,\n\nI absolutely LOVE this makeup on your skin!! You do not look too matte and to me anyways , you look fresh faced and a little dewey😗\n\nI bought the sticks from Sephora. They are coming today and I am super exfit3d to try them!!💖💖. Brianna is my woman crush so it's a bonus that I get to support $$ her and also support my own love of makeup at the same time!! Lol
I bought my shade online and it's about 70 shades too light. Lesson learnt: listen to Jamie and don't buy online 😂
See with the contour sticks do they have warmer ones? I use the smashbox ones still (throwback!) and I use a more cool toned one to contour, then I highlight (then I would cream blush if I used it), but then I blend my warmer shade where I would normally bronze and blend it a little further down or upward on my cheekbones and it acts as a bronzer rather than a contour stick. Don't know if you'll even see this but just thought it would help if you did want to utilise one as a cream bronzer.
Anyone sick of eyeshadow and eyeshadow looks? I sure am, glad Rihanna didn't make that her release's focus
I'm a huge fan of your make-up looks, but this one is the best I've ever seen on you. Your skin is flawless and the lipgloss looks stunning on you and suits you a million times more than anything I've ever seen you wear on your lips. You should def' wear the foundation n highlighters again and the lipgloss is the biggest keeper xoxo
Your make up looks stunning here! You look beautiful, love your hair like this too xx
Looks stunning on you, I think the color and texture is just right
Okay I may have to splurge on this line..maybe after my baby gets here because I'm just not feeling myself right now, despite all the makeup I have 😕 But this look looks great on you!! No creasing, nothing! Can't wait to see how it's worn! ❤❤
What color foundation did you use? Sorry if I missed it😬😣
Jamie!! why are you so perfect! Glowy is everything, BUT Matte looks good on you too!
You look a state, so probably not.
Why have I only just found your channel!? I see you everywhere haha, you're so down to earth! :)
You look like a glowing dream !!!! I just love it
Late to this .... but does ANYONE know which lashes she's wearing @jamie
NUMBER 34 ON TRENDING ❤️ love you boo!!!!
Your skin looks absolutely beautiful like this Jaime!! you look flawless!! I think it's a great look on you, but you have to be YOU and where whatever you want. but, I think having more matte skin you can play with eyeshadows, cheeks and lips more then when skin is oily. trust me, I know! Im an oily girl. it drives me crazy! many well wishes & much love hun. xx =)
really love the way your skin looks!!! the natural glow is amazing ❤️❤️
What shade of the foundation does Jamie use?
it looks so fn natural and beautiful ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
GIRL. YOUR SKIN LOOKS GOOD AS FUUUUUUCK.
I think your skin and highlight and minimal makeup looks Amazing on you
Love love love!! Your so amazing! Can't wait to try these products!
great vid,you look great and its made me want to buy the products so job done!!! my only minor problem is that you went over the Fenti with a load of bronzer and spray at the end so the final look is not really true to the discription. because there were so many different brands on your face its impossible to tell if the Fenti   was doing a good job. seems like the highlighter was the only thing and lip that didnt have your own make up put on over it.you still look great though obv ! pic made me click to watch so as i said job done
What foundation color is this?
You look blind in your thumbnail
Tattoos , no just NO
Have questions for us?! Ask them over on Super Carlin Gaming!
I know it isn't related to the video but what is the compound on his t-shirt
Can you please pronounce the German W as V seriously annoying and I don't feel like giving a full German lesson but you're pronouncing it wrong
Maybe dumbledor is so found of noot because he got him his pheonix
dumlodor fixed it with the elder wand
I really hope this theory is correct!! That would be so fricken cool!!
I've always assumed that Dumbledore just used the elder wand to fix it
I never watched the movie, I thought hagrid looks like the giant in clash Royale
What about the true path of the elder wand
Remember Hagrid isn't technically allowed to do magic, meaning as long as he isn't seen doing magic by the ministry he's fine, then again, dealing with fantastic beasts is magic isn't it.
Wait... do we know why Newt was expelled?
what if Hagrid is descended from Merlin?
YESYESYES!!! if that wasn't the original plan they should change it to be that XP
This went further than Hagrid's wand. And seriously? No spoiler alert?
His mustache not connecting on both sides is wigging me out yo
Answer. He got another wand....... Harry's wand broke. He just used another wand. I'm sure Dumbledore was able to pull some strings and get him and somewhat ok wand.
Try connect all HP theories in one vid. Do they line up? I have no idea 😂
Wait wasn't Hagrid in his third year when he was expelled? Shouldn't that have made him 13, not 15? Or did he start school at a later age?
personally i like the thought that Hagrid is just accidentally amazing at wandless magic.\n\nMagic is all about intent. Because Hagrid THINKS he wand still works, it does.\n\nBit silly yeah but i find it amusing
💥💥💥 *mind blown*💥💥💥\nYou have No idea how happy watching this video made me. It filled in so many blanks n got me super pumped for Fantastic beasts!!! 😄😄😄\nUr awesome!
Please tell me the truth about OLAF in FROZEN
Why do we never see any magical patronus animals throughout the series? We see a phoenix from Dumbledore, but how come no students or teachers have magical creature patroni?
Hagrid was 13/14 when expelled. Not 15. He was a third year. So unless he was held back...
If Dumbledore was born in 1881, and the happening with Ariana was when Dumbledore just had finished his school (1898/99)– how is it possible, that the legendary battle between him and Grindelwald was in 1945 (Dude, that sentence...)\n\nReminder, after the sudden death of Ariana, Dumbledore struggled with himself around 5 years to fought Grindelwald, until the community literally forced him to. (Because he feared the chance, to find out, that he killed his own sister with his very own curse).\n\nSo, the battle must've been round about 1903/04. Or did I miscalculate?\n\nP.S.: Sry for my bad Grammar. My English sucks.. ^^
So, you are passing on my theory that Hagrid's wand is a gift from Mary Kay for being the number one seller of blush for half-giants??? <Sigh!>
Doesn't this fly in the face of the theory video from Nov 2016 on this channel saying Dumbledore was not the true master of the elder wand?
She pulled out a set of the old robes Kreacher had laundered for them, and Harry retired to take the potion and change. hermione says this in the deathly hallows: meaning they presented kreacher with clothes. (chapter 12 near the end)
Plot twist: dumbledore transformed his wand into the umbrella so no one would know he had one since he wasn't supposed to have one
Damn, I loved this theory!!!
Caffeine. His shirt is the molecular structure of caffeine.
This theory is so good, I think it could be true.
Honestly if this theory isn't true, I might actually cry...
Harry Potter is turning into Star Wars
you ruined somethingabout harrys wand being broken and IM only on the goblet of fire :(
I wonder what Hagrid's patronus would be????🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Hi supercarlinbrothers! I love your channel, but I'm not allowed to watch it anymore because occasionally you cuss on it. I know that I'm really just one fan, but do you think maybe you could stop cussing? I would be really happy about it because I love your channel!
I really hope this theory ends up being true
I think Aragog came from Newt...he mentions coming from inside the pocket of a traveler. I think Newt is the traveler. I mean, who would have an Acromantula in their pocket? lol
I REALLY HOPE THIS HAPPENS!!!!!!!!!!!!
i bet newt is hagrid's father
whats the chemical on your shirt?
If Newt was expelled, how come his wand wasn't snapped?
I always wondered\nWhat was hagrid's house when he was a student
YOU NEED TO UPDATE YOUR INTRO
The books tell you what happened this isn't necessary
I literally didn't even notice the umbrella was pink...
Idk about the theory but I cannot wait to see where they go with Fantastic Beasts 2.
Ben, caffeine belongs in your coffee not on your shirt. Lol
Hey! Did you guys know that sir Cadogan (or whatever) CAN actually be spotted in the prisoners of azkaban(movie) when the fat lady portrait is broken. You guys should make a video about it!
That would make so much sense
Pausing at 42 seconds.\n\nDumbledore it's alwayse deus ex dumbledore.\n\nI so hope I right making this WAG.
I came up with this theory like 2 years ago I mean you just had to connect the dots in the books.
But if newt has already beaten grindlewald with his beasts could that mean newt is the master of the elder wand and neither Harry or dumbledore have ever been the masters
Could you do another zootopia video?
OI!  READ THE END OF FANTASTIC BEASTS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM!  ABOUT THE AUTHOR!  IT MENTIONS HIS WIFE PORPENTINE \nJust thought youd like to know
Have you ever thought that your theories are correct until you post a video out the theory? Exec producer: Well we can't use that idea any more because someone just figured it out.
can you please please please do a video about how tom riddle wasn't an obscurial!!!!!!!
I was wondering do you reckon a basilisk would make an appearance in fantastic beasts and where to find them
I want this to be true so bad
but dumbledore wouldnt be able to fix it because as in another theory you proved that grindelwald wasnt the true master of the wand which would explain why he and voldemort lost duels
W-what the heck you have facial hair now
It's also possible that Grindlewald loses mastery of the elder wand before the duel, or that Dumbledor knows a trick to defeating the master of the elder wand. After all, the invisibility cloak is another deathly hallow and supposedly completely hides its wearer, even from death, but Dumbledor knew exactly where he was. Dumbledor believes that these items, elder wand included, are not really what they are said to be, but simply very powerful magical items. Thus, the elder wand is not impossible to beat, just imbues its master with a lot more power, making them a lot harder to beat. Therefor, all Dumbledor need do is be clever about it and also be powerful himself by a wide enough margin to make-up the difference. He defeats Grindlewald, becomes the owner of the wand and fixes Hagrid's wand.
Loving the Woody and Buzz toys in the background by the way
I just thought that Dumbledore secretly fixed Hagrid's wand with the elder wand because he knew that Hagrid had nothing to do with the incidents.
I just realized Quidditch teams could just go to the room of requirement and get a bunch of steroids and firebolts.
If your names not j k Rowling hen your theory is bs! And her and warner bros sue any one who tries to monetise off of Harry Potter
What a cool theory I hope this is right
Fantastic theory! I really hope it's right
Are you guys Christians
omg this my first vid watching a vid of yours in 2017
I've thought Dumbledore repaired hayride wand for a long time
what house was Hagrid in?
3:58 Wasn't Hagrid expelled in his 3rd year? I'm pretty sure he stated in the first book that he was expelled in his third year.
I would absolutely love to see a young Hagrid. And a scenario like this would be great. It would explain so much and add such depth to Hagrid's character.
in case you didn't know there is a place in Switzerland called Grindelwald. just if you wanted that, then your welcome. however if you already knew it then... just checking.
I love Hagrid ♥️♥️
Ben, how long is your wand?
OMG I love this theory! This makes PERFECT sense!  =D
2:46 😂😂
hi j and ben i was wondering if you guys would ever start doing percy jackson and other rick riordan book videos.
phoeinx? a gift from Newt Scamander?
Great vid 👌🏽
Cool T shirt :D

Quando hai skriniar al fanta e nel momento in cui prende la traversa partono bestemmie in loop
Grande inter...ma anche contro una grande spal secondo me l'Inter quest'anno tornerà in Champions più forte che mai #AMALA #FORZAINTER
grande inter....we will back to champion league
Ho l'impressione che gli arbitri sapendo di avere le spalle coperte dal VAR, siano molto meno attenti che prima. Il fallo che ha originato il rigore per l'Inter era all'interno dell'area di almeno mezzo metro, è possibile che tra arbitro, guardalinee e assistente di porta abbiano dovuto ricorrere a un ausilio tecnologico e nessuno sia stato in grado di decidere?

God damn i like this new improved Henry Cejudo :D
Nunes does not deserve the win
Valentina clearly won that fight! if you think otherwise, please hang yourself
People here act like Valentina won,i was rooting for Valentina but JEEESUS,if you want the belt you have to FIGHT,she threw 50 punches in the whole match,2 of them landed to no effect,no pressure,just waiting....If Amanda would have played the counter game Valentina would have literally thrown NO PUNCHES....Im dissapointed in Valentina after all that shit talkin' and shit i would have expected to actually fight for it...and now she acts like she was robbed....This kind of fights really expose fighters like Valentina who just wait for a mistake....i understand the counter strike game trust me but man.....she literally did NOTHING in this fight
Where's Dana so he can say he has it 2-2 going into the 5th round ?
Valentina #1.   FUCKKKK YOUUUU BİTCHHHHHHH AMENDA NUNES
Yeah that Hobbie Lawler fight is the one to make. His hlord hesus Christ and saviour wants that fight.
First Cejudo fight and pressor I've seen. New found respect for his skills and his respectful attitude. Looked a lot like Conor's wide karate in / out bouncing style stance and extended arm - pawing at his opponent. Not a McGregor fan by any stretch of the imagination, just an observation.
Gustafsson admitted that he didn't do enough to take the belt from Bonesjones, even though he thinks he won the fight on points. Valentina needs to take the obvious hint, don't leave it up to the judges. To be the champ not only do you have to beat the champ, you have to rip the champs head off!
Hobbie lawler 😂😂😂
RDS vs Hobbie Lawler.
Fook you UFC How The hell Valentina Lost the fight. fook u
I watched the fight back in silence with a pen and scorecard. I gave Nunes rounds 1,3 and 5 under the current point scoring system. Amanda won, but the whole system is wrong and limited; needs a radical overhaul.
Nunes keep calling herself Lioness (female lion) but she keeps using Lion (male) image
Thats what happens when youre openly gay, you get pushed to stay on top just because of horrible propaganda
Robbed or not..dont leave it in the hands of the judges..
I wont lie nunes got the win but if it was five rounds she would have hassed and and been wrecked
I love how ppl are saying Valentina won, you dummies nobody won, they gave it to Nunes based on simple technicality, she just moved more at the end but both fighters didn't do shit the whole time I was actually thinking my online feed was buffering or something at one point cuz they were just like standing still, imo, they both lost, I would have sent a message to both fighters and other fighters in UFC and gave a decision of No Contest, both losers, you don't train for months and have all these people pay to get in and pay to watch it on TV and than after all the build up just look at each other and bounce around touching each other's gloves the odd time for 15 mins, fuck this fight, UFC needs to change is rules, in a case like this with no clear winner, have 3 fuckin bonus rounds, if still nothing, 3 more, eventually someone will lose clearly.
Nunes looks like a teenage boy.

Valentina won that fight, it was not close, Valentina landed way more puchnes and kicks.\nAnd only in the last round 5 Nunes did take down, at on the grond Valentina did even more punch in the face of Nunes
NUNES LOST BECAUSE SHE WAS A LESBO, NOT BLACK!
#40 on trending, just behind the make up idiots and cup cakers,\n i
big respez to cejudo, would love to see him fight sergio pettis for number 1 contender
Sorry Amanda. We would be more impressed with a finish than going 5 rounds. It's supposed to be the Ultimate FIGHTING championship, not the Ultimate Endurance Championship.
Cejudo carries himself like a champ. Its a shame he's in the same division as mighty mouse
UFC What are the fight bonus ?????????????????????????????????????
Cejudo is a stand up guy, and a legitimate badass. His striking is getting so much better!  He will be ready for DJ soon.
Did Henry just say he uses brute strength? ...uuuu ok ..u see brute strength I see brute strength bro. You 5ft 0 95lb man
Nunes vs shevchenko\n\nThe battle of grammar
Shevchenko needs to be humble in loss you fought her before you knew what you had to do counter punch don't cut it it was close but I think judges was right
Amanda is a good person
Lets agree here amanda was afraid to lose the belt n therefore fought the way she did n valentina the same onli cuz she was afraid of losing the oppurtunity. Alot of these champions r fightimg too safe they need to go bak to wat got them there in the first place
when do we get the drug test results
you can't win the belt if you avoid fighting
lol Nunes can either go 2 rounds and blast people then gas out or go 5 rounds and do nothing.
nunez said she didn't want tte ko or sub  she wanted to show she could go 5 rds 25 mins  BULLSHIT who wouldn't ko an opponent  if possible she sounds stupid
Bought women fought bad as fuck. Don't be bitching about judges now, you both lost.
Only i couldn't listen that stupid monkey nunes? Her face looks like my shit
Nunes lost this fight 100% Valentina should be champion!
Idk. I had it a draw but then Nunes got that take down at the end. Lets do it again! Trilogy!
why do people hate amanda so much? did she kick a kitten or something?
The commentary was fucking gold during this event.
Valentina didn't win, nor did Nunes. It was a DRAW and there needs to be a 3rd fight. Neither fighter did enough to win or even win a round decisively. Nunes' take down was nothing, it wasnt clean and she did no damage with it. It's a major floor of mma that take downs are given props like this. If you try a take down and can't land it clean or do any damage with it, that should go against you in the judging if anything!
Nunes needs to go up in weight and get a shot at Conor's belt, he deserves it👍
A MAN NUNES , what a gutless monstrosity...Dudes like that, shouldn't be around! The UFC should force him to fight CYBORG with Herb To the death Dean reffing that shit!!!!
Dude.....I cant remember ever watching a 125 lber post fight, but i'm liking Cejudo more and more. His style is entertaining af, he should technically be 2-0 since losing to DJ, and fighting for the title next against the plague.
Aaaaaand everyone hates nunes
shut up nunes you lost
Parabéns Amanda!
another boring fight card!!!
2-0
The dislike tho..... keep going guys....
Gj ufc for robbing valentina
I wanna see Hafael Vs Huthless Hobbie
Rematch again shev is better than nunes
Blasphemy
FUCKING ENGLISH    lol
A MAN DUH NUNES
Hobbie Lawler! 😂
Why so many dislikes??....
Amanda  No monster drink  Nunes.
Feeling happy for Henry Cejudo, good stuff!
Actually believe it or not Nunes won the fight, the punchings exchanges were positive for her the 2 first rounds. Valentina got more overall. Nunes' plan was to weaken that right leg from Valentina for the 4 rounds and then secure the win with a takedown in the last one. The standing fight was really close tho, valentina shown more combinations and techniques but most of them were not significatnt/strong ones. If Nunes didnt performed the takedown on the last round she would have lost. The last round was very positive in the standing game for Shevchenko.\n\nNunes clearly managed the octagon and distance for the entire fight, and thats a fact. Valentina knew Nunes was abusing her leg with low kicks and did practically nothing about it.
I think a reasonable person could see how either fighter could have been given the decision.   Valentina herself only thinks she won 3 rounds, so if the judges disagreed with her on only one round then she lost.  My assessment is that Amanda clearly won rounds 1 and 5, while Valentina won round 4, so the debate is who won rounds 2 and 3.  Valentina, I thought was too defensive and although she has quicker hands, she was only waiting to counter, problem is Amanda knew it, so Amanda was the aggressor but she was using low kicks and kicks to the abdomen, making it difficult for Valentina to counter and limited her scoring opportunities.  Because Amanda was the aggressor and the judges are suppose to award the aggressor, since they are bringing the fight, that's was the key reason Amanda won.  You can play it safe like Valentina, be defensive and only plan to score by countering the whole night, but don't be surprise when you lose, since the only fighter I've seen to have success with that strategy in title fights is Mayweather, but unfortunately Valentina is not Mayweather.  Lastly, I suspect Valentina was gun shy after feeling Amanda power in the first fight, since that's the only reason I can think of that would cause her not to let her hands go, when her hands are clearly quicker that Amanda's.
Round 1 Nunes\nRound 2 Valentina\nRound 3 Nunes\nRound 4 Valentina\nRound 5 Nunes\nWatch it again. I'm not a Nunes fan but that fucking bitch won fair. Valentina did more damage, Nunes scored more points.
Valentina beat herself with a stupid fight plan.  She used the same passive fight plan she used on holly but this just in, Amanda saw that fight.  Valentina didn't want to take risk so all Amanda had to do was be the aggressor in each round knowing since close rounds go to the aggressor.  Amanda plan was to simply out point valentina unlike her other fights were she goes for the ko, thats why she was smiling in between rounds because she knew she was winning.  She won the fights with those leg kicks, kicks to the abdomen and those take downs in round 5, while valentina was sitting there waiting to counter, something she didn't get to do much
That was some bullshit for real that the crooked judges gave Amanda Nunes the win over Valentina Shevchenko! They did her dirty right there. I finished watching the fight just now. Valentina clearly won that fight and should be the next champion. Valentina gave the most connected striking in each round than Amanda did towards Valentina. Valentina stopped one of Amanda's takedowns, successfully gotten out of one of her traps on the ground in the last round, with exception for the last takedown which Amanda didn't hardly do anything when she was on top of her. No submission or ground pounding from Amanda...while Valentina on her back was striking her really well. I don't blame her for being angry about the decision and filing a appeal for a third fight. For over a year now, these judges would make decisions over fights screwing these fighters of their win when it was obvious they scored the fight in each round incorrectly and unfairly. I don't what drugs these judges were on or what they got against Valentina, but they are wrong for making that decision. Sorry. They need to hire new judges who are experienced in judging these fights. That's just how I feel. 😠 It's time for a *Trilogy* ☺
Fuck your retarded decision... nunes lost... the fuck is this ? You should fire those retarded so called judges asap... what the fuck did they judge ?? They clearly are fucking blind bats
Wanna take the belt from a champ? Win decisively. Wanna keep your belt? Win decisively.
As bad as when Condit ran from diaz
For all you Valentine fans stop crying. This was a boring fight!!! Shavchenko fought like a little girl. To be a champion you have to beat the champion. Not by points but the head off. Nunes is the champ. She stood her ground.
sorry but Nunes really not convince me in this fight she do nothing  and everything she say in the post fight dont make sense Oo , in my book Valentina win the fight  but is look she dont make enough to win the belt
Valentina was frightened, she did not do the necessary to be champion, she talked too much and did nothing, robbery would be to get a champ doing nothing
why hate on nunes, she had a job to do and did it, the UFC fucked up not her
melendez needs to retire or something... he doesn't care for fighting anymore it seems... if you're a strikeforce fan... this isn't the same melendez at all.
Look at shevchenkos head looks like she stuck it in a beehive !She says Amanda didn't hurt her but did she ever really hurt Amanda?Amanda kinda Floyd mayweathered Valentina and then took her down to seal the deal no robbery close fight but no robbery
Shevchenko is robbed
Valentina won that fight!
#AndStill baby!
#NunesFakeChampion What a shame!!! 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼💩💩
Robbery, give her a rematch
Rematch!
I though that Shevchenko won the fight, I gave Nunes the 1st round then Shevchenko the 2nd, 3rd and 4th round and then Nunes the 5th, I like both fighters but seriously when Shevchenko lost it didn't really bother me as I like both fighters but I lost a serious amount of respect to Shevchenko because all she did was bitched at the end of the fight, other fighters are humble in defeat and she didn't even thank the the crowd, thank Nunes and said it was a really tough fight, all she did was bitched and said the judges are terrible and I won easily. Although I thought Shevchenko won, I lost a lot of respect to her
Valentina didn't do shit this fight, get over it, she deserved the L
Nunes won at best 2 rounds... Robbed simply based on the fact Nunes did get a takedown but did ZERO damage with it and actually received damage from getting hit from the bottom. Nunes was gifted this decision for sure.
Saltchenko fans make me so happy. Ya girl lost. Cry some more.
47-47 if you include the point which should have been deducted
How Valentina lost this fight I'll never know...she out struck Nunes....like Dana White always said never leave it in the judges hands.
Bout scores:\n\nJohnson x Martins (8/10)\nHenrique x Bhullar (2/10)\n\nClarke x White (8/10)\nTucker x Glenn (4/10)\nMoras x Evans (5/10)\nMcMann x Vieira (5/10)\n\nStephens x Melendez (5/10)\nLatifi x Pedro (2/10)\nCejudo x Reis (8/10)\nMagny x Anjos (6/10)\nNunes x Shevshen (2/10)
Valentina didn't show the fight of champion. Its not enough!
Nunes was 1-0 up in terms of their rivalry.she had less to lose. Even if nunes lost, it would have been a draw so she really just had to control the fight & avoid major damage.Valentina lost her chance. E.g Conor vs Nate... conor came back and won making it a draw.
I don't hate Amanda for this it's the judges fault absolutely disgusting obviously picking nunes because she black & a lesbian it's this generations wet dream me & shevchenko would gun all you antifa black lives matter down with explosive rounds then me & shevchenko will fornicate for hours on end
Valentina lost you idiots because to take a title away from a champion you have to put on a convincing performance.  If you don't then the champion always get the benefit of the doubt in situations like these.  If she actually went for it and fought instead of engaging in a sparring session the whole fight then it would be a different story.
Valentina, never leave it in the hands of the judges. To win a title fight you need to knock out or submit your opponent. You did not do that so stop whining!!!!
Greatest fighter is only Valentina...love u
Niel magney beat Kevin gastelum a guy who is exstremely talented and gave woodley split. And look what RDA did to him. I know mma math dosent work that way but still. RDA at WW is pretty damn impresive in POST USADA era.
Sue their ass,Valentina,fuck UFC,mafia scum!
How did schevschenko win? Amanda was the one constantly coming forward and she was backing up the whole fight. At some point the crowd was even boing. It was because of her.
who need ..., Tom Holland Biography Movie, all we need is Cumberbatch Biography Movie

Hell yeah, they better Tesla. You can't Edison without Tesla.

*_The Game is On!!_*
nicholas hoult is a super underrated actor. definitely excited to see him in this!
I fix problems for idiots.\nI'm sold.\nand why do this trailer looks like a superhero movie??
how about movie about Tesla! the real genius
So many brits pretending to be americans.
The film should be about TESLA, featuring Edison. Not the other way around. Edison didn't even invent the light bulb.   He just purchased the patent and had some interns perfect it. Wasn't even an actual inventor at all.
This is how you make a trailer - go the extra mile to show the parts of this particular story no one is really excited about, as if it WAS exciting (the dick and the largely forgotten mogul who was more interesting that people even know), infuriating everyone who knows who else was involved and how it all turned out, and then BAM! - the Internet's science crush drops the mike. The crowd roars.
anyone else getting a There Will Be Blood vibe?
I was wondering when Tesla was going to show up in a movie about the AC/DC dispute.
This is what was much desired!
I hope they put in how Tesla was huge advocate for Eugenics. Why solve problems for idiots when you can just eradicate them? Stop slobbering.
They set up this trailer almost like a superhero film. EDISON V WESTINGHOUSE - BUT THEN DRAMATIC REVEAL OF TESLA, INTRODUCED BY SPEAKING A FUNNY ONE-LINER.
Since when did Doc Strange, Spidey, zod and beast travel back in time to invent electricity???
Should've named the movie AC/DC, get it?\n\n\n\nI'm so lonely...

They finally do movie from Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure by jbern)))
That background score made it sound like a Bollywood movie trailer.
I'm a simple woman. I see Benedict Cumberbatch, I click.
IM WAITING THIS MOVIE FOR A LONG TIME, BUT WHY TOM HOLLAND BE NIKOLA TESLA . I HOPE HE DONT RUIN THE CHAR
Except Tesla was nothing like that. They stole everything they knew about electricity from him.
long awaiting for this story to be come in movies.....great job
I so wanted this movie for years but with Edward Norton as Edison. \nHe even looks exactly like him!
I hate films about capitalists
I'm a simple man. I see Benedict, I click.
this should have been tesla vs edison/ jp morgan vs westinghouse
Strange, Zod, The Beast, and Spider-Man working for an Electric Company... HEY YOU GUYS!!!
Love how Tesla is an afterthought....if this current war refers to the AC/DC wars.....Tesla won, and considered it the battle not the war.  Not to mention the facts that Edison was cretinous and abused anything and anyone he needed to (the cats and dogs in his neighborhood had a habit of disappearing, only later to show up as victims of tesla's electrocution engine as Edison put it.  Fuck that guy (Edison).
14.9.17 First Alan Turing and now Thomas Edison.\nNext time Issac Newton?  ^^
How come Michael Shannon never won Oscars baffles me

looks...deLIGHTful...see what i did there?
you can still tell it's his voice even though he hasn't got the accent
Lmfao about 3/4 through the trailer I was like this looks great but it'd be better if Tesla was in it too. This looks phenomenal.
Now there's a movie I never knew I wanted to see
Yet another movie in which our beloved Cumberbatch plays a genius.
Edison is a thieving, lying, piece of shit.
The curent war was a big deal. I'm happy they make a movie about it. Though the Tesla could have been saved for the theaters...
Telsa was so underrated in US history.  Edison took credit for his brilliance.  This movie looks awesome and its even more awesome how they make Telsa the bad ass of the film bc he was the one who changed the world.
Why can't we have a Tesla movie instead srsly
Quick note, Edison did not invent the light bulb
did just Nicolas tesla tell both of them idiots
First thought: No Tesla. Suddenly... Tesla.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell played.
How about a movie on Nikola  Tesla
Country circuit between visit writer joke violate honor.
Edison's one of the world worst dickheads in history, stealing others ideas and making its own. Nicolas Tesla by example. Fuck this movie. But I still respect mr. Cumberbath
Yes! I love movies with Bendelsnatch Cringleton! I mean Bendersnath Combertash! You know the guy I mean..
So it's a three-way fight between Edison, Tesla and who's the third one.
I got tingles when they announced Tesla...
If it has Benedict cumberbatch I'm watching xx
Isn't it interesting that today we use Edison's DC and Tesla's AC all the time, but for different purposes? Could AC work inside your mobile phone? Could DC be used to power a city? Possibly, but it would be a totally different world now.
Has anybody's reputation been more trashed than Thomas Edison?  I'm not saying it's inaccurate just that there's a surprising amount of media about him being a bigger jerk than Tesla
Wow man Tesla is there ,oh man last entry but epic entry !!!!!!
Amazing
Meanwhile everyone outside of Murica knows Joseph Swan really invented the light bulb. 30 years later Edison would take Swans design and merely improve the filament.
First Wind River, starring Scarlet Witch and Hawkeye. Now this, starring Dr. Strange and Spider-man
Here's hoping the soundtrack will be by AC/DC ...
Ahh, Tesla. They caught the good ol' Balkan mentality in the end of the trailer!
Oh, what a current!  WHAT A LOVELY CURRENT!
Seems like Edison was enemies with everyone
I see Benedict on the thumbnail--  yep.
So, Doctor Strange and Spider Man go against General Zod. Oh, and Beast shows up at the end.
The guy playing Westinghouse was the guy in Revolutionary Road with Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio- I just figured that out!
Is Westinghouse Zod?
Go Tesla !
Needs more Tesla!

Why is multiculturalism foisted on EVERY White country and ONLY on White countries? Why aren't ANY White countries permitted to maintain their own race and culture? This is not done to any non-White country.\nAssimilation and integration are foisted ONLY on White countries.\nThey call this anti-racist, but the end result is the elimination of only one race, the White race.\nMulticulturalism is a codeword for White genocide.\nAnti-racist is a codeword for anti-White.

I'm sad Sessions and the Justice Department haven't continued working hard to see the Clinton Mafia, Obama, Debbie Washerman-Schulz and all the other criminals put behind bars for their innumerable crimes, many treasonous and jeopardising the lives of United States citizens.  I am also sad to see George  Soros still allowed to propagate his groups like ANTIFA and the Nazi Party, both of which he has a hand in. He and his followers need to be deemed as traitors to the American people - insurgents.  Potus needs to stop relying so much on the Generals as they are ALL sinners, and ALL tied to Washington. Good or bad they are undermining his ability to be with the people.  The swamp hasn't been drained it seems to be growing in size with so many good and talented people removed, whilst swamp creatures remain or are rehired.  My concern for Trump's welfare is that they are placing him in a security situation where he will be compromised as the Deep State, forces of a satanic nature will attempt to kill him or make it look like an accidental death. We must remember though, even Satan himself doesn't know when the Lord shall be back for the elect (those saved who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and all he did on the Cross). So each generation he builds people to become his followers, doing his will, to bring about the antichrist, one world government, one world money, one world religion, the mark of the beast, etc, etc.  We seem to see an escalation never known before in human history - all that is happening in world events, plus, many many people, mainly Libtards, who have seemed to have literally, swallow a Frog or are in some type of demonic possession or are believing the proverbial satanic lie. Little Goblins running all over the place causing chaos and trying to bring the once God fearing USA down to the level of the demonic worship as seen by the architecture in Washington. Even 9/11, and I do remember all those that passed, the government traitors who knew and conducted this should all be put before a firing squad.  One day, there will be judgement. God's judgement at the White Throne Judgement.  All those who received the free gift of God, his Son Jesus, sins will have been paid for by Christ on the Cross, washed by his blood, but for those that rejected God's son, for those that refuse to believe he is the Son of God, they will face Judgement and then the second death, which is in the Lake of Fire, where Satan, the antichrist, false prophet, demons and all those who rejected the Son of God will go to be tormented forever and ever.  Why not read John 3:15-18 today, especially in the KJV Bible (King James Bible), the preserved word of God in English. Ask God for his Son, believe upon his name and all he did for you. The perfect, sinless man, born of a virgin, the final, perfect, unblemished lamb, who shed his blood, died, his soul went to hell where he beat death and hell and has the keys to hell.  Jesus, who on the third day was bodily resurrected and witnessed by his disciples and up to 500 people over a forty day period.  He left the Apostles and all those who are saved with the Great Commission, that is to see soul's saved into the Kingdom of God.  Christ then ascended to the right hand of God the Father in heaven.  Soon, when the sun and the moon shall darken after the Tribulation, and before the Wrath of God is poured out, Jesus will come in the clouds and his angels shall gather all those still alive in Christ and all the bodies of those who had already passed (their souls are already in heaven with the Lord). We shall receive new spiritual bodies and shall reside with the Lord forever and ever. Amen.
TKE Queer Bunny!!! to President Donald Trump Our 45th Of The U.S.A. https://101valkyrie101.wordpress.com/2017/09/07/tke-queer-bunny-to-president-donald-trump-our-45th-of-the-u-s-a/ … @Number10gov @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @AP
OMG...what the fuck is wrong with you people in the comments below!??  smh
Don't let this outrageous health care we're subject to continue with out repair or replace..... It was first in the queue and I guess first to be forgotten...........
What about North Korea, Right?
Tell the CIA we are COMING to WIPE them the fuck out for doing 911! We are coming for ya mother fuckers! CIA HQ in Denver! Go get em good guys! WIPE THE CIA OUT! HANG EM FROM THE TREES IN DENVER!
Best President in history!
@ The White House 🇺🇸 thank you😄
Feb to Aug job creation:\n2017  1,189,000      2016  1,422,000       2015  1,547,000\nJob creation has slowed under Trump by nearly 20%. Facts.
Some many greatest selfless Americans serving in this cabinet. Fantastic team.
What a fuckin' liar. You haven't done anything to increase jobs....America is still running on the Obama policies & budget. I still haven't heard that you & your family are bringing some of your businesses to the US to create employment & quit hiring immigrants to build your hotels & staff them.
If you're going to defend the Constitution, you have to remove the damn lawyers who are all barred from working in our government.  Start with the nine corrupt weasels on the Supreme Court and the scumbag lawyer who's the VP.
Man, people here are delusional.
So many lies, I wonder if he believes them himself?
God I wish these people would shit themselves to death.
He can't speak without a script in front of him.
He forgot appoint an evangelical nut job to the Supreme Court, advance forced reproduction policies to further subjugate women and deport, discriminate and persecute non-white people every where.  I'm sure there was only so much time...couldn't get everything in.
Even C.E.O.'s are abandoning Trump.\nFeel the Bern 2020
Is he reading from a script?!
Thank you for being obedient to the Lord . President Trump you are called of God . Blessings to you and your wonderful family.
I don't trust tillerson or Mattiis. They always look like they're plotting against the president. Watch your back Trump
Instead of a Mexican border wall, how about using  immigrant labor to help rebuild Florida and Texas?\nLet's give them citizenship for helping.

Ok back to business... Simple tax plan: Start with the Fed: Step #1 Fire,  Step #2 Their, Step #3 Ass, we must immediately fire 50% of our federal government this will be the best thing that has ever happened to the American people. Mr President yes you are a star now yet when you fire and imprison their asses you will become the greatest president of all time and we should carve you into Mount Rushmore!!! \n\nThe first and most important to downsize is HLS, BLM, IRS, EPA, any one in charge of the money at the Treasury that is printing should be fired asap. Further anyone acting as a government official that is doing business we should fire immidiately. The government serves businesses they are not a business. They are SERVANTS who ever is not a servant fire them immidiately... Thank you Mr President We are counting on you to Fire their asses as we will do nothing with these criminals in charge!!!

None of those men truly have the President's back. All deceiving vipers they all are! I pray for President Trump
I'm so impressed with Pres. Trump's administration. He's doing a great job, in my opinion.
Mr. POTUS, please order all the FEDERAL agencies to buy American made  for the disaster relief and for reconstruction of these devastated areas.  This will ensure US money circulates within our Great Nation.
people if you can troll HRC's stupid book signing.  What Happened?  Good question Hillary.  What happened to your emails?  What happened to the money you collected for Haiti? What happened at Benghazi?  What abt your Uranium One deal?
There are more forgotten men besides those who have lost a family member to an illegal immigrant.  There are people who have lost children because they smoke marijuana, and have been thrown in jail for a substance no worse than whats legal, probably better than most prescriptions.  Remember them for a change.  The drug war is a big government program, be conservative with those funds.
Blessings upon our great President Trump,  eight years of Trump triumph.
I'm not surprised no one actually watches these videos and subscribes to these channels because they are too busy protesting and being stupid without even knowing what's really happening in the background and foreground. They only watch CNN and FOX and think that's what the world is. Well i'm here now. I'm happy to be here and be informed of our government's activities in our great country.
YES TILLERSON.......AS YOU SIT BACK AND CONTEMPLATE.....................JESUS IS THE TRUTH AND THE ONLY TRUTH
love you Mr President. would love you even more if you'd drain half of your cabinet and install trump-agenda loyalists. \nGod bless USA.
Right down the street from my cousins
May President Trump be known as the most praying president in history,  Glory to God!
Mr.President you are doing an amazing Job!! Proud Hispanic Trump Supporter🇺🇸💙

THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP, FOR BEING TEXAS-TUFF AND FLORIDA-FIERCE. WE WANT YOU TO WIN FOR US EVERY DAY. WE WILL PRAY EVERY DAY FOR YOU TO WIN. THE FATE OF THE FREE WORLD TRULY DOES DEPEND ON YOUR SUCCESS. WHEN WE'RE AT THE GATES AND WE'RE ASKED WHAT GOOD WE DID IN THE WORLD, WE CAN SAY WE SUPPORTED YOU, AND THE GATES WILL OPEN FOR US.
May the Lord God of Israel bless you Mr President Trump in the name of Jesus
We need a new political party, without the neocons.
Obamacare is the greatest tax is it not?  $12000 for a family?
yes always keep the Lord included in all things.
Your all drinking AquaFina water 😳 That shit never freezes because it has antifreeze in it!! 😳😳😳😳😳😳
I reject protecting his interests in offshore cloud tax havens. They can all be completely annihilated and still maintain their value while accruing even more interest. The US shouldn't be used as a tax haven for multinational criminals to avoid their fair share of the debt society is forced to undertake. A negative income tax is long overdue, imo.
Trump is a member of the Coup Clutz Clowns.

It is currently hurtling through the Caribbean and has been moving with sustained winds of close to 150mph. We are not sure where Jose is going. Some are saying New York.

TRUMP / PENCE 2020!!!
北韓會報1951年仇，美國在不打朝鮮，因為他是世界最大產釉國，而美國傷害過朝鮮，他們會報仇的，等他壯大，同時一次射一千顆州際飛彈氫彈，美國會被滅亡，到時美國會後悔，當初不決戰境外，相信我
trump already ruined the United States Constitution.
Why does he have to read everything off a screen cant he speak his own words....
It is often said that Trump has no real ideology, which is not true—his ideology is white supremacy, in all its truculent and sanctimonious power. https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/10/the-first-white-president-ta-nehisi-coates/537909/

I couldn't make it to Sephora the day it released so I went the next day and it was sold out! Your beat is amazing though!
This look is so natural, I got to have this.. You got me hype now lol
Loved the video but honestly I'm just entering to win in hopes I can get my hands on that RUM highlighter!! Ugh finally a shade for us Caramel toned Colombian girls!

that Rum thing is killing me!!! it looks so nice on you!
I'm so tempted to buy now but I don't have a sephora near me to match my foundation correctly.
I would love for this to be my first actual makeup set!!!!! #shamelessfenty
Omg I'm so happy you hit a million subscribers Maya!!!! 😆😆😆😆😛
#shamelessfenty ❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍 you did a great job with it as well
Thank you for the review. You're an amazing person.
Hi Maya! I've been watching your videos since I was 15 and I'm now 20, watching you has inspired to be shameless and to focus on myself, on my happiness, your beautiful personality and contagious smile has always touched me. I'm so happy you have been growing yourself and your channel. I hope you continue to do videos and I wish you a very happy life. Love you!!!

i loveee this look so much!! so beautiful and natural!!
Amazing I hope I get this
The website for the giveaway won't let me post a comment so I'll just leave it here so I know you'll see it.  I'm a new subbie! I watched your million subs video and it inspired me to subscribe. I really love what you're about. You said there's always something to be happy about or celebrate and I have depression so I've been trying to live my life by that mantra. Also my name is Maya too!! #ShamelssFenty
I am obsessed to get Fenty beauty for me... it looks exactly how I like, beautiful and natural. Congrats on 1M girl 😍😍
I don't wear makeup at all but I love watching Maya do natural makeup looks and this is a great 1st impression of the Fenty line. Feeling the need for the lip gloss! Love this video Maya!
The only person who didn't over hype Fenty Beauty. I feel like this review is 100% honest
haha...Maya you can't be putting highlighter everywhere! XD
Living for that Rum highlight💙💙💙 and the reactions in this vid had me dying lol
I love that natural look <3
You are soooo pretty, even without makeup on! damn. i love the way you do everything without any makeup brushes. nice job
Love the look! I love makeup that's natural and light!
Wish i could afford this. Looks great on you, Maya.
I've had such a hard time finding a foundation that matches my skin tone because I have a really weird undertone! So I can't wait to try this one out and find the perfect foundation! #shamelessfenty
I love you put rum all over lol! You make it look so easy and fun! #shamelessfenty
I'd love to win and try out Fenti! #shamelessfenty
LOVE THIS! You're absolutely fabulous. #ShamelessFENTY
I will be happy to win 😍
I think the foundation being light as opposed to thick is an excellent move! Light makeup can be layered on to your liking...thick makeup is just that....thick...goes artificial looking quickly.  Kudos to Rihanna for all the shades!! I'm getting mine!
I swear I only trust your opinions love you boo ❤️
That gold highlight tho 😩😩 (EC)

HELLO FRIENDS!! hope u guys enjoy this strange franken-video! how do u guys think it did? i wanna make more!!
I loooove when you do these types of videos!!
Omg! Im starting to love your videos!
You look weird on preview pic
She's so intelligent it kills me
she makes me laugh for some reason
{\__/}\n( • w •)\n>🍦<\nwant some of my ice cream?\nI'll give you it if you sub to my channel!
That one looks particularly like a skid mark lol.
The lipstick and foundation looked really good together
0:54 you should've said If I mix them all together, maybe I can get the best of both worlds.
I love these video the only thing I cringe at is when she says schmash
It seems to match my double chin pretty well when I do my double chin test 😂😂
I mix all my BB creams (maybe 1 or 2 CC's here and there) together everyday all the time lol it's honestly the best shade match I've ever been able to get!  I'm really pale with strong yellow undertones though so it's really hard for me to find the right color because more 01 shades are for pink undertones and anything yellow is wayyyy too dark like regarding the rest of the color.  So mixing them pretty much let's me control how much of each one I want (: \n\nAlso, just a little tip for anyone who's foundation is a little too mat, mix in a little liquid highlighter as well (: that always give me a super pretty sheer touch!
She can totally stab me with that eyeliner
the kids in africa could've eaten that foundation
Try to look for your shade at Fenty Beauty!! Rihanna is queen and made so many shades ❤️
safi ya go back to buzfeed please u know you miss all the people
You should see if Fenty beauty has a shade for you. Rihanna has 40 shades.
oooh your fingers on the dry paper made me cringe
We said Frankendation at the same time 😂
YOU LIVE IN GLENDALE \nYOUR LITERALLY ALWAYS AT THE AMERICANA
Frankenstein full face. Do it do it
F yeah! I think the frakenfoundation turned out great. Makes me curious about mine! PS: STILL LOVE the color of the frakenlip ! Love these video ideas. \nHave any pigments? A FRANKENSTEYE Look would be awesome!
Can you mix all your blushes?
Should you mixing all your highlighters together.
Are you going to try Fenty Beauty by Rhianna?? I think that would be an awesome video!
you should do like blush or contoring colors next (: Oh! Highlighters definitely too lol
Mix all ur eye liners and eye shadows and poweders and wear all of these for a day. Great idea aint it?
Why does she reminds me so much of Robin from 'How i met your mother' 😂😂😂☺️
Roses r red violets are blue u thought this was buzzfeed so did i
He died in science....😂
I use the NYX drop foundation in a 11 and it matches perfect but then as the day goes on it makes me look lighter but when I use the 13 it makes me look  tan like I've been in the sun for hours and I'm already tan but not that tan.
You should do a buying makeup from wish. Sometimes I buy makeup from wish and they give me the totally wrong thing, but most of the time they come earlt
Person:I like your lipstick \nSofia: thank you\nPerson : where did you get it? \nSofia: um almost every makeup store ever \nPerson : *confused*\nSofia : I mixed my nudes \nPerson: nudes?\nSofia:yes nudes like color \nPerson: ohhh ok well bye
this is my first time watching Safiya's videos and I love her personality omg
The erotic music killed me 😂
In the last minutes of video, it is so funny to see Tyler reacting to your face and hair! LOL!
Person: I love your foundation! What brand is that?\nSaf: What brand isn't it?
Your eyeliner didn't even move ! What eyeliner is it ?! Lmao
Hey you need to wax your arms please I'm not tryna be rude
Me and her have the same skin tone cool
It looks so good xx
Why are all Caucasian foundations yellow or orange. Isn't there pink tones?
Is her last name pronounced niggered? Don't get triggered.
You remind me of my technology teacher...
I feel like you get all yellow under tones and from what I see your undertone is more pink.
You should see if a fenty shade would work for you.
4:52 lmao this part i love it
I'm a free lance makeup artist and I mix 4 foundations to get my perfect formula/colour! I knew this video was gonna be successful
I think you can only successful mix together cream products... Try cream highlighters!
Does anyone think she sounds like the girl version of Markiplier? no hate.
I have a aunt named Safiya xD
Why does she make all this stuff if she's not gonna use them again
Not to be rude but her skin is soo shiny and it's gross ew
Tbh you looked great in that franken-dation and franken-lipstick. Of course you're still gorgeous without, but I am very impressed with the results!
Next mix all of your blushes
I feel myself moistening BRUH😂💀
Mix all ur lipstick colours!
GIVE ME ITTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!
You should do eyeshadow next
I feel as though the flaw here will be that you will also get all the negative aspects of each foundation mixed...
do eyeliner next ❤
Maybe she should try scraping abit of all her eye shadows and press it into one colour and use it? Or highlighter
Hi, is there any small youtubers want to support each other? 😋
can u try painless wax on ur arms pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
you should do this without bb and cc creams and skin tints or do a just drugstore one
I hope buzzfeed would not steal the idea of this video. Just like themixing of lipsticks .
Now mix all your concealers
It matches you perfectly keep using it

Esto si es reggaeton a lo vieja escuela, que buena cancion, W & Yandel los papas de estos pollitos, que lastima que don omar se vaya a retirar, seria genial otra canción como my space, o nadie como tu... Nosotros también hacemos música los invitamos nos escuchen y apoyen.
W y yandel \nMéxico los quiere ver juntos de nuevo los amamos\nEsto es musica
I feel like this song was made a long time ago because wisin saids “ahora eh” and he hasn't said that in years last time I heard it was like on his 2002-2004 album takes me back to the good days

Cuando w y y hacían musica bad bunny  era un un niño pendejo en pañales

Todos diciendo Por fiin! Volvió el mejor dúo!. Gente, por favor entiendan que esto es sólo un featuring para el disco de Yandel #Update, sólo eso! No sé emocionen tanto!
Los vaquero dejando en claro quiénes son los dueños de esta pendejá
Esta canción sube el ánimo. ¡Te pompea!

Aquellos tiempos, escuchar este tipo de canciones me regresa en el tiempo que hermoso.\nOjala y no se hubieran separado <3
Like  si quieres que este dúo regrese y haga un buen perreo
Siiiiii qué lindo volver a escuchar a este dúo juntos ... Lo mejor de lo mejor .. reggaeton como de antes 👏👏👏👏👌👌👌😍😍😍
Este dúo ❤️, escucharlo de nuevo me recuerda a los buenos tiempos de este género.
Llegaron los que van a tumbar el trap... Solo ellos podían
Like si crees que hoy subirá masivamente los Views , de esta grandiosa canción...
Mano vamos a reventar esta mierda de views para que no se se den cuenta que lo queremos juntos otra vez
Soy fan de Wisin y yandel prefiero escucharlos juntos, Felicidades éxitos y Bendiciones...Tengo que preguntarles por una de sus canciones y si es posible me ayuden a encontrarla quisiera volver a escucharla una de sus primeras canciones con una chava, la canción dise halgo así y mientras yo sigo aki el drama es una historia de enamorados pero me trae muchos recuerdos de mi infancia, ayuda les voy a dejar mi correo Fernando.martinezs101@gmail.com
Los extraterrestres , Pal mundo , Los lideres , La Revolución , Los vaqueros , REGRESARON !!! \nVuelvo a mi adolescencia , no me importa nada vieja !!!
Esto si es reggaeton bueno, ningún dúo como este, ahora si podemos volver a la frace: lo que usted tiene es hambre y sueño 😂 😱🙊💗
Esto si es bueno 👌👌\nLos escucho desde hace 12 años de 23 que tengo 🙂
When ven que el trap esta creciendo salen estos reyes para extinguirlo y que sigan con la vieja  escuela
Mi mente revolucióna al subir el volumen y me para los pelos  al llegar los poderes. Cantando a las Mujeres.  Yehaaa
Regreso la receta original pegao y pam pam como antes!! El verdadero perreo 👍👍 los extraterrestres W&Y
Son los mejores 3:36 minutos de todo el 2017!!!!!
ajajajajaja no volveran a hacer lo que hicieron antes , solo agregaron las frases o palabras celebres de sus canción antiguas ... porque no se dedican a analizar su regueton antiguo y meditan el porque se hicieron tan famosos con esas canciones\nPsdt : esta cancion es una cojudes , prefiero sus antiguas del 2002 al 2007
se ve que les ba mal con el negocio que hicieron cuidado el infierno existe

I need to know who directed this video this shit is epic. I'm very happy for Kelly. She got better wardrobe, better makeup, this song is sickening. I'm ready for a new era of Kelly Clarkson.
What a come back, perfect
This song is perfect

The more wight this women gain the sexier she became 🌚
I love that yellow dress! She's so pretty and talented!
love the diversity in this video she is the best
If she was lost in the wilderness she could use her dress as a tent, and a distress beacon. That's pretty cool...
Hello everyone! I love singing too. I need my covers on YouTube to spread. Sorry if I put it out like that, I just need things to turn around, but I can't do it on my own. One view can seriously make a difference. I wanted to thank all the constructive criticism I've been getting. I always appreciate support, in all its forms. Thank you!
3k people have no rhythm or soul.
Cool! Subscribe to my page just songs I recorded on my iPhone nothing serious my listen I just posted some I did today  :)) follow me on instagram @pauly.riley
How do you love react a video?
I am in love with this! And she is looking ah-mazing!!! #BringBackMyGirls #YesKelly
Is a mix ok Amy,Christina, Adele and Megan 😐
Lose some weight for your health please
Can someone tell me where 1:55 - 2:08 is from\nI can swear I heard that somewhere
The chorus sounds like Buttons by the Pussycat Dolls
1:18 Perfect place in case of a zombie apocalypse haha
Meghan Trainor or Kelly Clarkson??? Look and sound the same
Her dancing makes me think of mariah carey lmfao
I prefer her older songs, however, I don't mind her newer style.
15 years since she won American Idol and I just can't believe it! Still so amazing and that voice of hers is perfection!
This is my new jam
Kelly Clarkson is like Adele now....
I can't find a way to hit THAT note.
Great video. oh and fuck all the people who call her fat. Kelly is fucking sexy as hell from head toe.
She looks even better now. OMG. she is so talented. Fuck off everyone who judged her for her weight. She is not in this world to be skinny, but to sign the way she does and to be that awesome person she actually is. Keep it up kelly!! \n♥
ITS ALL SO GOOD DEAR LORD
Keep going. 3 million squad where u at?
this look and sound INCREDIBLY FUCKING GOOD
Yaaas !!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 she's back!! \nNew fav song to dance & sing in my truck with my 2 little girls❤️❤️
❤ *hey. do you want me ?* ❤\n❤ *i will show my sweet **#pussy* ❤\n*here* ✒✒ https://t.co/n88XZA9C0R
This is so fu**ing UNDERRATED, People don't know Art anymore
I LOVE Kelly for always raising the bar!  Go Kelly, go!  Looks and sounds fantastic! <3
Slaaaaay Kelly! though I wish she wore little to no makeup in this video. She's such a natural beauty she doesn't need it.
Now where tf her viewers at cause 3m is cute but Taylor got 340m on a whack ass song in comparison.👌🏼😒
Trying to be like adel
I don't believe Kelly ever left...so making a comeback doesn't make any sense.  Kelly is a powerhouse when it comes to her voice, personality, compassion and honesty.  This young woman has come into her own.
I like the yellow gaun, the white scene! It's like everything!
Love so soft & Paramores Hard times are my favorite song of 2017!
2:15 killed me babe! I'm still reviving
ARGH THIS VIDEO IS TOO MUCH
I HAVE LOVED KELLY SINCE YOUNG OMF
Who else  couldn't just watch this video once and move on?
Why do 3000 people dislike this. Idiots. I hate Justin Bieber, but I don't go on his videos just to press dislike. This is an absolutely fantastic song though. So catchy and powerful.
only me, or its more common to see overweight singers(male and female)... good thing - when im right - music is about the voice/instrumentals etc not about the body.
She never ever lets me down 👏
I LOVE this music 😍😍
This sounds like Nelly Furtado's song
Yes yes yes! Kelly Clarkson is back i love her!!  Lets it to 3.5M!!
Coming to the comment sections because i just knew there were gonna garbage talking smack. All of the haters that are criticizing her on her weight why do people like you exist? You are awful individuals. I'm surprised your mother haven't taught you manners scum.
You know why I hate Kelly. It is because she didn't release the video on her own vevo channel. The song wud have been more popular there. Such a lovely song.
Her voice is amazing so glad shes back... What a powerhouse!!
I LOVE KELLY CLARKSON I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE FULL RELEASE OF THE ALBUM
This must be #1 in billboard...💋
THAT voice!!!!!... omg
Favorite song right now
beautiful
2:15 is everything
Kelly just blew my mind!!!😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥

This song/video is deserving for a BILLION VIEWS!!! Great colar Kelly and Dave.
she got chunky
dude shes so fat
kelly clarkson why getting fat ..My Heart Already gone
She is the best american idol and she is one of the greatest singers of our generation... Her voice is electrifying...
Hahah, it says absolutley.. erm..  **Backs out of comments slowly** 💨
this was depressing. also people aren't going to search about good things because they don't need help with those
If someone were to go through my search history they'd think I'm a psychopath XD. I'm writing a murder novel so I have to search up stuff like: How long it takes for a body decompose, strangulation, how to completely get rid of DNA, decapitatio- ya know what you get the idea XD.
What happens when normal people take antidepressia?
Could you do a what would happen if you looked at the sun with eclipse glasses in space?
Is it just me that has to rewatch this at least two times to understand all that is said. I'm stupid
Stop and realize you are a 10 pound brain piloting a near 125 pound slab of meat.
Wow... I haven't searched for any of this!!
lol. Many rich rappers use the N word and the B word , and no one cares. Seems like it's ok only if the caviar left does it. Maybe the statistics come from the edgy kids looking for those songs.\nAfter what people say about google search engine these days, I won't trust their statistics.
My search history says that I should be behind bars and should never be released
hey, really good job, but you speak so fast ! haha
My search history. Porn, porn, porn, 4chan, 4chan, porn you get the point.
I google a lot about my period.\nI mean they say pain is normal but i don't think I'm meant to be laying on the floor for hours screaming in agony despite having taken specially prescribed pills to stop cramps.\nI also miss most of my periods.
Looks at friends history.\nRoblox p00rn\nHenta1\nWhat is search history?\nP0rn
u mean no one other than American s are using internet..... u r saying the world as america..... then where we from mars???
Google also never auto completes a pornstars name.
Why do we have a gut feeling?
That i have a problem with memes.
I've made it so Google doesn't track my search history. 9/10 times I'm using incognito mode. I make it a habit to use Tor, Edge, or maybe Chrome on Bluestacks to switch things up everyone once in a while. And Ghostery is enabled whenever I use Chrome. Now no one will discover just how much time I spend on YouTube.
Thank God for the Incognito Tab!
My last words will be Delete my... Internet search history.

lol, racism is not as alive as you would think. To proclaim the search increase for the n word as yes this correlates to racism rather than the great meme wars, shows how little understanding of the subject you actually know. \n\n Let the memes be with you.
search history: too much Pokémon, anime and lemon fanfiction
Hmmmm\n*looks up search history*\nwww.thepiratebay.org\nwww.kickasstorrents.se\ngoogle: Best torrent VPN\nHmmmmm, wonder what I do...
And if you have no search history, its pretty obvious what WAS there
This video should be called What your search history says about you (BY YOU WE MEAN AMERICANS)?
That I'm a total weirdo
It's important to keep in mind that just because we search for something, doesn't mean it's the truth about us. For example, I don't think people regret having their kids just because they type that search term. Perhaps someone is having doubt and searches the Internet for like-minded people just to feel re-assured that it is OK to have those doubts.
*Puts John Cena as my screen saver* what search history?
How many people just clicked on this to leave a snarky comment??
My search history just makes me seem like a homicidal food enthusiast.
ya know that there is something called incognito mode right by just Shift+Ctrl+N
Father and daughter?\n\nBrother and sister?\n\nWho the fk are these disgusting fks?\n\nSick....fking sick.\n\nThe stepmom thing is still fine. It ain't incest....you ain't related to her. At most it's like having sloppy seconds from your father. Which is disgusting but still....compared to the others....fk me....
Sorry but I only search about my waifu, touhou games, manga and anime maybe 0.001 are hentai
1:17 \nThe 40% is from the black people
Should do a ED ep
The phone in the hand of the Male looking for fun illustration looks more like the tip of his (huge) D.
Hmmm...\n*D E L E T E  N O W*
and this is why the incognito tab has been created...
Apparently I'm the only idiot here that uses incognito mode.
Morel of the story: \n\nAlways use a private tab
Saw you guys on the xq school program
My search history says nothing about me, because there is nothing, all the time
I searched for... none of these, actually...
How can we reduce anger

I searched mostly on history and politics, like Steven Crowder and Ben Shapiro.
Bro why y'all tryna see incest porn
Science behind quicksand?
So what does it say if I've not searched any of those things
I use incognito all the time, I just tell people it works faster.
This makes me feel so much more normal. xD
Can you do the science of Accutane?

My search history looks like Dorian Gray 😂 over the years

Could you do a video on intermittent fasting such as the 5:2 effects on the body xx
Can you guys do something about miscarriages.

this video somehow made me feel better about myself!
Please please please tell me how the scientists came to know haw does milkyway galaxy ,our galaxy,looks like? how do they took its photo please tell me please
Do a video about diets for kids
I've searched the N-word before and like jokes that use it, At least for me it had nothing to do with racism.
Mine is just filled with anime (not weird type) and memes lmao
My search history is clean... what does that say about me?
Mine makes people question my sexuality
@AsapScience What if everyone was bi?
Well mine is average, I dont watch degenerate unnatural things like porn.
Have you guys done one about hair? If not, please do
What's the science behind the fact that the ques to womens' toilets are always longer then the mens'??
I want more statistical vids like this.
So interesting!!
Yeay my photo at 1:39...

*COUGH COUGH* hentai *COUGH COUGH*
*searches something with the word nigger just to troll google*

I don't get why everyones sleeping on this song! It's the least streamed of the album on spotify 😔  show it some love
Yass mani slay❤️❤️👏🏻
Proud to be a Harmonizer 😊
Im fucking upset this song deserves so much better than this one-set video wtf EPIC RECORDS WTF
can they make a music video for Sauced Up or Make You Mad or Bridges or Messy or  DON'T SAY YOU LOVE ME??!! bec i'm so here for it.
I love Normani but her face and body is two different shades.
social media friends to come get in the groove.
It's like write on me and I'm in love with a monster combined omg  <3
It sounds like Dinah is saying pussy 💀😭\nStill love the song!
If they surprise us with anything else........... I swear but they better   slay tho
Wooh go Dinah! ROCK THAT TONGAN IN YOU. I'm Tongan too
This song is a trash!.. Sorry guys :)
how the hell am i 6 days late???????/
Ally just looks so awkward in this video. All the other girls have beautiful hair and make up. She didn't even have winged eyeliner like everyone else and her hair is flat and frizzy... smh they are doing her so dirty lately
Songs like this are the Fall of Music. I like a few of 5H's Songs but most of them die quickly and don't get attention.
*THE REAL CLASS      THE  ONLY QUEENS* \n\n *harmonizers ot5 its like*
Here the haters do not have to attack, as these girls 💘 are pure talent ♡ 😍👌
I didn't know Ally's voice was so beautiful I'm shook! Why the hell did they not have her sing more before this album????
Trying to be like Beyonce on dream girls hmmp
The girls look good but I was disappointed with this video. They could have let the girls do so much more with this
Anyone knows how to play it on piano?? the musical note??
They really should get a bigger budget for these videos. I think that you know who got more then them it's a shame because these girls are pure and deserve all the attention they can get
This video is very slow in reproductions, it is sad.😞
Every song on the radio sounds the same, this one is no exception. Sorry if this offends anyone.
3:28 is your favorite part if your smart
Am I the only who hears Camila at the do, do at the chorus???
Finally an actual good song from them
Hey girl hey 👋🏻 you guys are good
camilas vid has more views and it aint even a video yet smh
ALLY SLAYED! Don't fight with me! 😍😍😍
Camilla or whatever her name was is so shook rn lol. Can you imagine her basic ass in this video hahaha no.
Whats the name of this delivery service😉
00:51-00:52\nALLY CANNOT LET GO OF THAT MOVE I CA N T
Sounds good, I liked it! 😀
The first girl is so damn pretty 👌
Why did this get less views. Is it cause they weren't dressed like sluts. Smh
My favorite out of all their songs they put out this year. They slaying and they deliver!
Why are the views increasing very slowly? :(
All these girls are flawless and I'm over here dealing with acne 😂😒
my favorite song by 5h, and they give more fame time to ally and dinah which makes me happy
I remember camila in Lauren's hair it's like camila's hair  in I'm in love with the monster
This video is everything
Normani bby girl 🍫😍!!! Ally you so cute & them vocals!! Lauren your voice ✨✨ you're so pretty!! Dinah 😭❤️😩 wow
Thank god we have a new generation of destinys child
This deserves more views ❤️ \n\nWho agrees?
I know I'm (NOT) gonna get any likes on my comment ☕
Lauren and Diana nailed the look
Fuck yeah I'm all for this
Turds are like why isn't lauren and normani singing much in the song but don't you fucks understand that the song he like that Lauren and normani sang almost the whole part of the song I guess it was dinah's and ally's turn to takeover majority of THIS song aswell
THEY ARE SO PRETTY I'M CRYING
love this song. kinda beyonce vibes. my girls always slaying. now let's just take a minute and how the makeup and hair are ON FLEEK!!!!!!!!!
These four ladies are shining so bright, all sharing the spotlight! Now they are an official group. Loving their new direction, very R&B. I'm definitely a fan.

Ally ft. Fifth Harmony
This song is trash
This song is going to become sooooooooo underrated.
they barely give normony any lines to sings and they barely show her in music videos but she still shines
👍🏾 IF YU LISTENED TO THE ENTIRE ALBUM I KNO I DID THAT SHIT🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
Are you guys going to go on tour again because you guys have a new album?
This video and song is wack in my opinion. 5th Harmony isn't even getting views like that since Camilla left and that's a fact.
Dinah!!!! finally her spotlight
I dont need subtitles anymore..I just need their *VISUALS*

More love left by the  religion of peace 😏
Part and parcel of living in a big city. Nothing to see here, just more \n*C U L T U R A L  E N R I C H M E N T*
Sulooooooo he star of the show....other guys just a long for the ride
just go and tell someone don't stand about! and they wonder why people get hurt!! :| let the professionals deal with it!
Get them all out of england.fooools
< < CLICK PICTURE AND COMMENT EMAIL FOR A FREE IPHONE X. I PROMISE
The British insult the US because of all our mass shootings, scholl shootings, etc, yet, they've had how many terrorist attacks recently??? Close your damn borders people. You'll let anyone in.
Did the guy have a beard ? Or was he a Asian man the usual BS .
Is this suppose to be before or after it had 'exploded'?
Terrorism is so progressive.
The guy at the end has the right idea
oh look a fire on a train. let's all film it and see what happens.
Religion of pieces strikes again! Cute.
what the heck is a tube carriage? don't you mean A SUBWAY?!
What did the sushi say to the bee \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo no to corny🌽
Corbyn says it was just some a disadvantaged IED looking for a way to let off some steam.
The only crime here is vertical recording
Muslims gotta take responsibility and tell those terrorist Muslims to stop doing bad things. Please, it makes me sad to see people get hurt :(
Part and parcel of living in a big city .. I ain't even surprised by the attacks no more it's kinda entertaining 😂
Ooh look, that bag's on foyer...  (Handler arrives to inject some much-needed gravitas into the scene.)
DUDES LITHIUM BATTERY FOR HIS SCREW GUN CRACKED AND MELTED DOWN.. THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME.
Is that bag on fire? -  Sherlock  -
Looks staged. Theres no soot or burn marks on the seats of walls of the train. Probably just a chav that lit it and ran. The media just causing hysteria.
BTW people were injured via stampede, not so call news paper on fire
The Seahawks should have ran the ball
lets look at it in awe.
The product placement makes me think Michael Bay did it
The attacker was part of a division of ISIL, And the British Police had their eyes on them for long time.
Why is this a problem?\n\nIt's just doing it's daily commute!!
Britain, especially it's cities and mainly the South of England is rife with racism and hate. It's almost like a brewing civil war here.
Ah, that's where my mixtape went.
Wow just stand there pointing at it... fail
Oo look a potential terrorist lets walk towards what could be a Bomb!
It's an iPhone X
Tomorrow's all Lidl should be checked our.. For potential...
DAM I forgot my mixtape on the train!! Atleast my mixtape is fire tho.
Now I know how women feel in the bedroom
Credit where credit is due. The LU employee deserves credit for the way he acted. Anyone else agree here?
This is absolutely shocking and appalling! I mean who does vertical filming these days...
tube carriage, that's new
People if it were a bomb it would have gone off at that point, I suspect it's nothing more than an e-cigarette(they explode quite often) or a telephone
This is the point in the movie that a bomb explodes killing thousands
Theresa may needs to strike back when they find out which state caused this
One logical person is in this video try spot them
surely the emergency services would have extinguished the flames at this stage?!! would they really just let it burn?
Heard the note 8 was released
Oh so they got the bomb in lidl then?
I don't see how a little fire can cause so much chaos and injuries I mean the bag itself and all the area around it has no sign of burn or damage if there was a lot of fire where's the damage where the smoke ????? And also which idiot believes they would walk a witness or injured victim pass all the press when there are ambulances and police cars everywhere I mean common it's staged incident act gone wrong. She didn't have a hair out of place or a single stain on her clothes
ISIS take credit for everything, at this point I just think they are trying to become relevant again and taking advantage of this.
Oh look a bomb lets get close and point at it
Smoke bomb or flare in a bucket...pfff hardly a bomb! so pathetic it makes you miss the good old days of the IRA.
It was burning because u we're recording vertically
if you're gonna die, at least die doing the right thing!! FILMING HORIZONTALLY!
They should put the bomb in a Samsung box, then blame it on a self exploding phone.
THE SWORD OF DAMOCLES WILL FALL ON ISLAM !!
Woah very surprised and it is funny as I did not even realise that this happened till 2 mins ago
Isis have party today cuz of london bomb attack but nobody die haha\n\n\n\n\nSorry for my bad English
Oh, there it is. I was wondering where I left my mixtape.
OK, get out your candles, vigil at 7pm tomorrow, Make sure some nijabs are in your selfies and instrgram pix. Then down the pub. Repeat.

Islam.. its the religion of peace.
Isn't immigration wonderful
Was it Muslims?.............. I bet it was!
wouldnt people know who came with the bucket? i dont believe this.
Wake up people! It's another divide and rule exercise.
Wow a burning bag, let me get close to it as it might potentially blow my face off.
Wow...i never expected for soo many ppl to be soo racist towards muslims....so ppl ARE idiots and rlly do believe everything the media tells them 😨🤦‍♂️
I can hilping london... Cost somthing good
To my fellow muslims dont even bother trying to speak or reply, its over for us, the media won years ago and we can no longer do anything, just stay protected from any potential retaliation for acts that you have not commited, dont bother explaining, we are all tired lets just give up.
*It was an iPhone X*
Wait A Minute!!! Is that....no...it couldn't be....OH NO!!
these comments are mainly racist and xenophobic bless this country for containing so many idiots
Why do you tolerate them when clearly they don't tolerate you?\nAncient, barbaric cults are incompatible with modern civilization.
19 people hospitalised yet the train has no damage?
If you want some reasons to buy the iPhone X\n\n\n\nU will love my latest parody on my chnnel
The Holidays are coming. That means Holiday weight gain and iPhones that will no longer recognize you......did my iPhone just call me fat?!
I'm quite happy with my iPhone 7 but it dose look good I would get it in fact I'll get it next yr if I get it
seems hypocritical to tell people you hope they wont get the phone, but you're going to get it. meh...
Everythinkapplepro stop bossing what to do someone may want to buy it some people don't so stop bossing
Now imagine the naming scheme go crazy once the standard iphone reaches 10
which is better iPhone X or Galaxy Note
They just want your front camera imperative to function and unblocked. You laugh now but when your blackmailed making the o face by a hacker beating it to bbc, bbw, or pawgs you won't b.
It's a pity they don't have ProMotion enabled
iPhone 6s is still the best iPhone for the price and the performance
What a dumb title, \nReasons #1-10 , it's an I phone .  That's all folks , no need to thank me .
*in india it costs 1700US$ ... and some idiots call us poor*
For me hardware specs matter alot in a device way more than the features do. So when I can get a phone with better specs at literally half the price. It makes it really hard sell for me.
I'll stick with my galaxy s6. Its got more features than i know what to use them for and does what i need it to do but the battery is shit. Dies within a day if it's getting used. Fuck iphones
Whatever.. Next year they going to release the iphone 11 with much better things :DD it's always the same
his name’s Philip?
I will never buy it, very ugly device... I will use my iPhone 7Plus for another year :)
ever since Steve Jobs died APPLE especially Iphone has been TRASH. He would have been disappointed.
Tim Cook needs to step down. Apple has stagnated. As the late Steve Jobs said in 1996 Apple Almost Went Bankrupt Because It Failed to Innovate.
iN tow days I will get one 😛😁
I feel like it's slightly criminal that he warns his audience about the flaws of the iPhone 10 and recommends not buying it, yet he will. Liked the vid that
Unless a phone can do something that no other phone can do it shouldn't be 999 wtf is wrong with apple
I think i'll stick to my iPhone 3. It's still a perfectly good phone,I don't need a fancy phone with fancy features.
This remind me of trump supporter..... Apple can do no wrong. Apple is just a brand, and people worship them like gods. There are better phones. I got me an iphone 6+ because i love my headphone jack and i would get a better phone but i just use it for calling/music. I got a pc to play games and a real Camera to take nice picture.
This phone is for dumb, 0 IQ rich peoples
Apple's now be a robber
ya lost me with the whole Yes, I will still be buying it
iPhone X: A piece of shit with wires
4:48 when u pulled up how u got more icon at the bottom after the torch
Why the fuck is this #2 trending 😆
Idk, I kind of LIKE the notch. It adds kind of the uniqueness rather than the classic apple design I'm actually kind of bored of the old design
Only problem is the new features... on the newer iphone with different portrait mode option ... apple should provide this features on iphn 7+ too . With the new ios 11 update
3:18 You realize that was a joke right...
Simply go to google and simply type: *gamesecrx guide* You will get the only free secret tool completely FREE for the game.
Great video, writing and presentation.  However, that sibilance is killing my ears.  Easy fix on most audio software Keep up the great work
I would rather buy the iPhone 4s cause it is now pretty popular for moders and jail breakers. I would like to mod mine to have a better storage but then again, i don't know if it could be done yet.
So 999 for a phone which is worse than the note 8 in almost every way no joke apple had to buy parts from Samsung just to stand a chance I know which phone I'm getting
You know it's bad when even Apple based channels are telling you not to buy this $1000 scam.
If they had an iPhone X Plus I'd be all in ( if the price didn't kill me first ) I don't know if i can down size...
what's next. Why you shouldn't buy the Xbox one X
If you are gonna get the iPhone X can i have your iPhone 8???? :))
Definitely not going for it.
I'm a Apple fan I hate it when ppl talk negative over iPhone / Apple but I agree with you the price is to high. I bought my new iPhone 6 last month for €150.- euros and the iPhone 10 is already 1000 dollars😱 really ridiculous
Face recon is not new it's been on Android for years. And it's easy to hack. Just print out a picture of the owner and hold it up for the phones camera. And getting pics of phone owners is so easy because I Phone owner love to selfy
The reason he posted cause he broke an wants views
uh can we all direct to the fact that it has a glass back and that makes it easer for it to break if you drop it *aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh wtf are you doing apple*
When youre happy for the iphone X ,only cuz the six and seven will be cheaper
Do I need a $1000 brick just to listen to some music, view some web pages and make some phone calls.
I will buy the HTC u11 everything is awesome about it
The better solution is to wait for the 7 or the 6 to be even cheaper and get a shit more for your money.
Just don't buy any iPhone.
HIS NAME IS PHILIP! 0:33
Despite this meaningless video, the only reason why you should not buy an iPhone-X is because you can't afford it.
Nice Car and House. What do you do for a living? thx
Its no better than the s6 note what a waste of money...
Guys, I like how you are upset for the phone costing 1000 bucks in USA. It costs 1366 in the Czech Republic. Way over an average month salary. That's just swell...\nLG V30, anyone? 🙂
Only 2 reasons not to buy iphone x.\n\n1. No headphone jack\n\n2. No external storage
Yeah, I'm going to sit this one out.
Who the fuck uses a 1000 dollar phone to take pictures at the beach /flood line
Saying 64gb isnt enough is crazy. I have 32 in my S7. and I have had it since release and I am not anywhere near fillin git up. Thats me though.
I like Iphones better anyways and we switched phone plans so I got stuck with a shitty Samsung phone that doesn't even have a brand and 64 is better then 8 gig's so I can't complain about any other phone and great video
sorry but im on iphone xxxxxxxxxl s color c
xiaomi mix 2, xiaomi mix, samsung s8, samsung note 8, meizu pro 7, apple is just creating expensive shits that not creative, the phone overprised, and you need to spend extra 500 dollars just for a full Apple devices for your shitty phone, go fuck yourself apple, dissapointed
You’re very unbiased. Love your videos homie... 💯
By the time this phone is paid off, the iPhone 14 will be on sale 😂
u americans are lucky you pay $999 (£730) and we british people are paying £999 ($1357)
Change ur name to EverythingSamsungPro
I love Android and the whole experience but I might be ditching my G6 this year for the iPhone X. iOS is just so smooth and it's quick. My G6 has trouble with Snapchat most of the time and it overheats like crazy sometimes when I try charging it. My girlfriend has the iPhone 7plus and I don't like it due to the huge bezels but this new iPhone despite the price looks promising.
It really seems like a step down from the S8
if they did wat reddit posted than it would look even more on the smasung gallaxy s8
One minute after you buy the iPhone *X* it will be worth 750 bucks maybe if anyone has the cash to buy it at that. The face scan is probably #government funded to have more proof in the courts/law system to track what you're doing, when, who, how, etc. You can think we'll just don't do a *crime* well what IF? You was driving playing on your phone when you pass a intersection where a person is being stabbed at that moment. You drive on unknownly yet your going to *jail* because you witnessed a crime but didn't report it, your phone showed your was there & awake since your phone camera was recording at all times
Guess girls are gonna have to put their new face on every time they use this
His voice is echo
In my country, 1000-1200$ is litteraly what you pay for a new phone for example the Samsung S6, S7,S8 or the Iphone 6/7 (when they came out ofc)
the fuck how is this revolutionary
can we play GTA V on iPhone X
Y'know, that first reason is actually the biggest for me. I've had an iPhone 4s since 2014, and as I've seen all my friends go through the flaws of the 6, I decided I'd keep waiting until Apple perfected their new design to upgrade. I think, thanks to this awesome video, that I'll get the 8 and wait until Apple's perfected this new full-screen design. Thank you!
I wouldn't use an Apple product if it were free.
Apple said they've been developing this for 10 years, and the a11 was in development for 3 years, so how is this phone a first generation that's just been developed and so will have flaws?
the most disgusting phone ever

https://youtu.be/Yu32rcSgrt4
Google photos cough cough
Makes a video on why not to buy the iPhone X, then days he will be buying one. 😂
Nexus phones in 2014 already done the facial screen unlock method and some other phones as well.
Why not just buy an android problem solved
STUPID Video.............. its a perfect device .....
There's a cult of hate around Apple. It's pathetic really when you consider other manufactures upgrade incrementally just like apple do.
I'm not going to lose another kidney
I would not pull out I really love her.....
Ok, this voice she does was mildly funny at first I guess but now it's like.. PLEASE STOP..
She needs to try being funny without that wack Adam Sandler retard voice
I can listen to cardi talk all day
Okay that silly voice is getting Annoying,can you do a serious interview for once??ugh
Why they don't do their research 🤦🏾‍♀️. Anyone that has listened to the mix tapes knows Bodak Yellow isn't on either one.
Damn enough with the Jokes already
Lol @ all the thots saying they love this annoying ass thot
I love her personality.
Can we appreciate how far she came... from a trash to class but still having the same character 😍😍😍
she hilarious, she the only ratchet that I would love to be around cuz she would make me laugh, it's cute af
That's just her.. she ain't trying to be nobody else..
Why they keep that bored nigga in the back he looks so bored
Why she makes it voices for
I think she's playing fool to catch wise. \nEasier to dodge tricky questions.
This interview is terrible because they are asking questions that any good person on the rise would answer. They know better. They needed better questions. Cardi is being herself.
First time making a comment, this finna be a breeze!!
Whoa Cardi is silly like that? I wasn't expecting that.
If her man watches this his heart broke... When she said I have a new number i feel his pain
OKAY, DON'T SAY YOU DIDNT MIMIC KODAK LOL ITS THE SAME FLOW 100% Shit fire but don't downplay that lol She living and I love it but we gotta be real about it.
I'm so happy for her. I can respect a hustler 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
thats why she is loved by so many people because she is real and nothing needs to be  changed with cardi or does she need interview training that will throw fans off if she  changed
Is she dumb? I mean for real?
All these hoes look the same. Blonde weaves  fake asses fake tits and small noses
Does she really talk like tht??
Amazes me some of the shit that comes out of America.... it's true anyone can make it in murrca.
definitely stole his flow dont be ashamed to admit it. she put her spin on it but yeah...swagger jacked
She took the summer over this year 🔥❤
God she is so fucking boring. A doorknob has more personality than her. God bless any of you folks that can watch this longer than 5 minutes
Im tryin to hate her ratcheness but cant get mad at her ,she just too fuckin honest  lol
I literally get a different type of cancer every time she opens her mouth..
she make charlemagne giggle like a little child haha
Cardi cool freaky don't care for the song, I tried to listen twice, I couldn't.\nSeems like all the ratchets like the song. I still want her to win though!
6:28 in, thats all i can take.
anyone out there( don't feel like researching ) does she have a ghost writter cause I don't see her writing  her own shit with her .. what it seems limited vocabulary,  no offense,.. love bodak yellow
She needs more interview practice. Answers don't make sense. I like her but has a hard time explaining herself or being quick answering the questions
Luv her spirit....she too hype. Happy for her. Wish her much more success & she DEF in love just look @ her when Offset name come up...she mad smitten💛💛
Cardi just like me I'm almost 21 don't got my license and I drove before but when there is no one in the streets it's much easier
I can't even get through this interview. I love her but she needs an interview coach. When to turn all that off. I'm happy for her success. I tried but I couldn't watch the entire thing. It's too much at times.
The good thing is; if her music career ever flops, she can always become a (stand up) comedian! 🤷🏿‍♂️ I love her
She's on drugs
I love you Cardi B! You are so humble. Don't change.
Why do I like this crazy woman lol?
All this hate for this lady
I want her to randomly start talking regular for just a second
Cardi has that immature personality and it's genuine...but at the end of the day she needs to have more fulfilling bars in order of staying on the top of Billboard charts. Bodak Yellow is a catchy song but and sounds hard af for a moment when she says the intro lines 'Hey lil B_tch'...but falls off really quick IMO as though she is reading the lyrics off of the paper (Something that Studio Engineers & Producers can hear from most recordings and the lack of flow from rappers during their flow).. But compared to most of these newer rappers she doesn't sound better then the majority out there now a days who lack flow and only do the 1 plus 2 plus 3 A B C lines..
I'm prolly weird AF I guess because I find her really funny I laughed thru the entire interview lol
Cardi is at home with the breakfast club so why does she need to change her personality? The media training will come but she should never change what makes her...her. The whole Nicki situation is pointless. As far as music I feel like if Nicki was talking about Cardi she's doing it to stay relevant as a female rapper because she fell off. They both said there is no beef so no need to harp on it. Personally I couldn't stand Cardi however, I gotta respect her for being so real. She grew on me and I love her hustle. Self is somewhere crying right now wishing he believed in her.
The first time I saw her act was in Being Mary Jane, she's a great actress.
First I wanna say how I love the fact that a Legend like Janet Jackson dances to Bodak Yellow on her new tour which I have tickets to 2 shows. Getting props from a global worldwide Legend like Janet should make her proud not to mention she's getting paid for Janet playing her song during her tour. Anyway, I'm glad Cardi ain't on this let me be another female rapper who hates on Nicki bus. Seems like so many just wanna create fake beef and shade between Nicki and any other female. Cardi and Nicki like each other and have shouted each other out on instagram and elsewhere. Not to mention they also follow each other on Instagram. Get over it!
Guess I'll  go watch the video 10x now
She talk like when I mimick someone laugh
Fake as f*** I think It's funny  she talked s*** about Nicki and everybody else but then she tells them all it's just because of this it's just because of that dumb b**** f***** her right or wrong? She goes where ever it goes HOE I don't Lik Niki but dam makes Niki look top shelf/BAD B!TCH an she's garbage no fukin love from me ........ member the dumb okay looking girl at the party then u think she hood good girl an then she's fukin everyone that's that salty getto trICK
Mayne she on fire🔥🔥🔥rn everywhere i look her song playin r somebodys cars...congrats tho.
Hood Cinderella that never lost a shoe.
This was an AWESOME interview... One of the DOPEST, FUN ones yet... I'm feeling Cardi... Looking forward to her continued success... Keep your foot on them B...
She so fine and funny 😍
Gotta respect shorty grind! She hop on love n hip hop  as a platform to not only be known nationally but really put in work know that boy Dj Self hating himself for not taking her serious bout that rap game
I like u cardi but u not a sister
You know what I'm sayin
I completely got that Bring it On reference; Cardi's witty.
She show the breakclub mad love 💪💪💪💪
SHE IS SO FUCKING FUNNY LMAO I can't stop laughing
she is so entertaining
I highkey wanted to see a glimpse of Offset 😖but its not about him at this moment 😂
You know what I'm saynushmaiwna
This shit is cringy asf bruh. I almost feel sorry for her. She sound like a retarded Floyd Mayweather when she saying you know what I'm saying. Oh my GOD this shit is hard to watch. lmfao
This is a new age artist, meaning she's in the same space as the cash me outside girl... the labels are investing on people that have a movement and a buzz with them, be it good or bad. Props to her hustle and hopefully she stay on because there is always a diamond in the rough, but be ready for a lot of one hit wonders.
So awkward when that brought up Nicki 💀💀
She's high af! 😂
Cardi I love you but hunny you said You know what I'm saying at least 200 times! 😂😂 Baby girl let's work on your interview etiquette😘
Count how many times she says like 😂
That voice always reminds me of Boomhauer from King of the Hill.
Damn this hoe is an Air head !
Is this Cardi B, or Bobby Boucher ?
So this is these females role model these days...stop the planet please, I want off
She low key mad funny 😂😂
i listen to bodak yellow everyday
Wtf did I just watch lmao😂😂😂😂😂
She's humble
Salute🙏🙏🙏
#SUPPORTCARDIB !!!!!!

oooooh loving the hair!! in love with some of the things you bought!
Do more videos like this xxx
The primark candles don't smell as nice  when they burn 😩
I bought a pair of harry potter pyjamas at primark
Were all a sucker for primark.
I'm tall so am up for this 70s, wide leg trousers thing to make a big time comeback! Also, can't be doing crop tops as clothes come to short on my elongated frame already!
I did the same thing with my friend 😂 Possible my favourite shop, mostly for all the Disney 😜
I've got that ceramic cactus on my bookshelf 😁
How much do you pay You tube to trend every week?
Pink hair is very hard to pull off.............but you pull it off perfectly, it looks beautiful x.      Oh & I'm a hufflepuff x
RAVENCLAWS COME OVER HERE I HAVE PI
Why do you look like tinkerbell with a huge tooth gap on steroids
I love you hair Louis 😍
I love those light boxes!  One of the little boys in my class got me one at the end of last year, and put 'World's best teacher' on it.  He made sure to carry it very carefully all the way to school so he didn't disturb the letters.  How precious!?
The rose gold hair is wonderful on you.  It looks rose gold.  Is it?
Hufflepuff !\nJust go on pottermore and you can find out what house you are :)
Would be lovely to easily buy clothes without holes and missing fabric or at least have more choices for those that don't want that :) In favour of a 40's and 50's resurgence. x Ps. Love the hair (and the bow)! x
What is Louise's lipstick colour xxx love you hair x❤️
i love the B&B items. i went to primark in Boston and I gotta say that I wasnt impressed at all. the quality of the clothes is horrid.
I want capes to come in style !
I love your hair!
I'm a slytherin lol do the Pottermore quiz
I'm with you on the 40's and 50's!! I like fit and flare style dresses and comfy clothes.
i love your hair!!! If my hair grew out quickly i would totally dye my whole head. \nLOVE IT !!!!
Your new hair colour really suits your skin tone.
It's spring in Australia at the moment and a lot of our fashion has really cool embroidered stuff on it at the moment 😊 I LOVE it!
Oh my gosh your hair looks beautiful. Also, I'm so with you 1940s clothes need to come back (or at least not be so expensive). So I was just wondering where do you get the majority of your clothes from? Because no matter what I can't find anything. Thank you!
[I'm crying because my state doesn't have a Primark]
I LOVE your hair!!!!
I love your hair! Gorgeous! 😍 :) hair goals x)\nIt's only September and I'm super excite for Christmas! (Which is also my birthday) I love shopping for others and seeing their reactions :) it's so much fun
Definitely not Slytherin. You said that in an awfully accusatory tone there Miss Pentland! I happen to be a proud member of House Slytherin thankyouverymuch! 🐍🐉🐍🐉 I was so excited when I took the sorting test because not only is my favorite color green, but I'm obsessed with snakes. Before you go ewwww, do yourself a favor and Google hog nosed snake drinking or playing dead. So cute.
Another video where you tell someone not to watch because of gift spoilers and then you put that thing in the thumbnail 😂😂
I love the 1940s and 1950s fashion and wear it every single day!!! I love finding new vintage clothing websites to buy new clothes from!
your hair looks incredible i wish i had the guts to do that!! 😍
I need all the Disney items
Loving the hair Louise, and I'm a hufflepuff btw
your eyes look so lovely with your new hair color!
I'm a Hufflepuff, I loooooove Primark's candles (pineapple + prosecco has probably been my favorite!), and your hair looks so lovely!!!
I am feeling this fashion atm, but do wish the cuts we're more flattering on me (def more 40/60's for me too!) It's sad because I really do like the clothing, just a lot of it isn't right for me
I'm in hufflepuff :)
Want a lot of primark autumn stuff
Louise you gotta do the pottermore quiz to find out what house you're in!
Love watching your videos, feel like I am just chatting away with a friend. My friends and I also break out in random songs and geek over the most random things. This is the perfect way to end a long work week!
Your hair is beautiful,just like you,keep smiling
so nice to see pink hair again
love the bows! except i also wantd to bring scrunchies back and now that they are i'm really angry and protective. also obviously your hair looks bluddy amazing and im also noticing i like a darker hair colour on you, i think it frames your face rly nicely. xxxx
I love the navy star scarf. I am in the U.S., but I might have to get one for myself. Also, your hair is beautiful and I appreciate you for also wanting to bring big bows back. xo P.S. I am Ravenclaw, but most guess Hufflepuff.
I agree, fashion trends lately I feel suit very specific body types....my hips are too wide for this stuff!
i love your hair!
I need that wardrobe purse in my life!!! They have so little wardrobe paraphernalia in the USA!!!
I love the 90's fashion, but like you I cannot wear it. It does not complement my shape at all. I love the 50's fashion a lot. ❤️
1950's would be amazing on both our body types. I got to do grease in school and it was so much fun
Why's she always in trending even though she only has 70k views???
Oooo!!! I love you hair it looks so nice!! Xxx
Literally no matter what test I take it says I'm a Slytherin and I'm happy about it 😂😂
Okay, 1, your hair is amazing. And 2, I don't like the t-shirts with the rips in. Partly because you'll get cold...and partly because they don't suit me. Whatsoever.
Such a good idea to start buying Christmas presents early
Your sooo lucky! I can only wear gold plated ear rings!!! My ears get infected every time  i wear something  that isnt gold!!! Also im in Gryffindor! 🦁💛
1. you look great. 2. I shopped at primark while I was traveling Europe and loved it! 3. love ya girl
pink looks so amazing on you 😻
I used to LOVE wearing bows in my hair until my dog ate them all 😅 Etsy has a ton of really inexpensive ones that people make!
In complete agreement with you on the 90s trend! Looking forward to winter fashion though - much fewer crop tops in stores! Loved all the homeware bits, Louise. And your hair looks fab xx
i wish i could pull off that hair color 😭😭 love it!!
I didn't like the 90s style when it was the 90s and it's worse now... just walking through forever 21 and being like really? They brought THAT back?
I'm a Ravenclaw!!!!!

omg i wish i looked as good when i was pregnant!! GLOWINGGG!! and what a beautiful nursery x
I know this is not baby related, but I love your lipstick and I'm wondering what brand and colour it is ❤
Hi Fleur I've been watching you since 2013. You have always been my favourite you tuber. It's great to come on your pregnancy journey and watch you and Mike have your family together. I have four children with my husband, our kids are our world. Just wanted to say I appreciate your videos and love to see what you are up to. Would love to see more kind of vlogging if you get chance but appreciate how hard it is to do everything.
Beautiful woman ♥ lovely bump ♥ good luck for you ♥
Dear Fleur, you look so beautiful and just glowing! This is such a pleasure to share in your pregnancy journey, thank you for sharing with us.  As for 'the line', I am similar colouring to you, and never had a line once in any of my pregnancies. I don't think that blondes get 'the line'. Much love to you all xx
My 'inny' belly button turned completely inside out when I was pregnant and was super sensitive . I'd take it out now and re -do it when your body returns to normal after the birth.
You look so beautiful and amazingly happy....Great video!
You are looking amazing Fleur! I am a Brit living in Australia and I can't recommend the Bonds wondersuits enough! They are also fantastic when your little one starts walking and in the morning you can pop their feet out without them slipping all over the floor. The nursery is stunning! X
#5 in trending!! Well done!! ☺️😘 Upsets me when she says 'it's weird' about the bump though.... pregnancy is the most beautiful, most natural thing! Embrace it gurllllll!! 😘
Due 22nd November and love watching what you're getting. I find all the choice quite overwhelming! Very good luck love x
You are too cute! I'm 22 weeks with a girl (due 1/20/2018) and I thought I was the only one that would say good morning (Aaryn) and talk to her every day. I love my mornings with my little girl!! And I love my bump too - we're about the same size!! Enjoy the rest of your 2nd Trimester! 💜
I'm currently 22weeks+3 & I've taken my belly piercing out. Purely for the reason I like a nice smooth bump & when I was wearing tight tops you could see it sticking out lol! Although, my belly button has started to stretch over a little now so isn't as deep (if that's the right word?!) as it was. Ha! \nI love that your only a couple of weeks ahead of me, I feel like we're going through this together! I'm also having a little girl 😊💕 x
Your baby is going to be super stylish
My sister left her belly ring in for all three babies and it definitely moved , like once she was near the end , the ring was a little ways away from her belly button , but healed fine and looks the same now .  Also you look amazing and your bump is soo cute Fleur
Hello Fleur, You are looking really well. It's kind of you to share your feelings and excitement about your pregnancy. I know this sounds twee, but because we have such regular contact with you, you feel almost like family, I know that that sounds ridiculous to even to me, but I trust you get what I mean. Consequently, I think we only have the very best of wishes for you. So I will shut up waffling and send you my best. xc
The world needs more people like you, you are pure joy, no ego, you're the epitome of what a genuinely happy and content person is! I wish you and Mike the happiest times starting your family.
Congratulations again to you and daddy mike
Haha. My girl who is also due end of december also had her hand in front of her face during the 20 weeks scan. The 3D pic looks the same lol
In France we have special piercing for pregnancy ! That are longer and flexible ! 😊
You are beautiful! Your baby bump is adorable! My oldest always responded to music when I was pregnant with her. I was taking a music class and she would just jiggle the entire time I was in class or when I would do the homework. Lol. She's almost 13 and still loves music. I have lower back and hip problems as well. I went to a physical therapist while pregnant. She gave me exercises to do at home that really helped while I was pregnant. They also make support bands/belts you can wear to help take some of the pressure off of your pelvis. Glad everything is going well!
Only a week ahead of you for my own pregnancy and have been loving your updates! =D
I want to just reach through my screen and give you a hug! I think i've been watching your videos since...2009?? Anyway, love you!! Xo
You are absolutely glowing Fleur.  Thanks so much for sharing this journey with us.  Lovely looking nursery :)
I love that you're going to be a mum. It's the best thing that will ever happen to you. I thought so.
I am currently 39 weeks pregnant and 22 years old. I had my belly pierced when i was 18 as well. I was determined to not take my belly ring out and bought a pregnancy ring. I ended up not liking that as well as a regular ring so I havent had a ring in since around early august. I dont think its closed up so I'll see about putting the ring back in once little one is here!
Or you could just get the ring one instead of a bar
I smile through all the video because it's beautiful to see someone so happy and gleefully pregnant. This is definitely you're time!!!
How many babies is she having again? The washing machine is a fantastic invention!!
You look absolutely stunning!! Bump is so cute!! 😍😍
I'm so glad you got some bonds wondersuits. They are amazing!
The way I like to think about months is by the day of the month - so for example, if you're due 1/1, then 9/1 was 5 months and 10/1 will be 6 months, etc.  Loving the videos - it's nice because I think you're just about a week ahead of me.  😀
They sell belly pregnancy bars for your piercing
I felt I connected with you around your wedding time because I was also in that stage of my life. I now feel connected to you again because of your pregnancy blogs because I'm pregnant with my second currently. Ps your bump is so cute!
Fleur the flexible bars work amazingly.  I haven't had a baby but I have used them for working out.  I found that my leggings would run on my piercing and it would irritate it, so now whenever I do an ab workout I pop in a flexible bar and have no problem.  You can get really long ones that are designed to work with a pregnant belly.  I'd recommend trying it if you wanna keep the ring, worst case you find it uncomfortable you could take it out
Your baby bump is beautiful!  😍 And the scans of your baby are so cute 😊. Love the chair you chose for the nursery, a lovely color and it looks so comfy!
You are gorgeous and your bump is so cute! It's so fun to go on this journey with you and to see you so excited!
Fellow mommy here and love these videos 💜
Just beautiful!!! Thank you for sharing everything!!!!!!  Xoxo lots of love from Toledo, Ohio❤️❤️
I can't believe you're having a baby!😱😱
Love the nursery.  Very soothing colours.  I do agree though with another commenter that the awesome faux fur rug seems like it could be a tripping hazard when you/Mike are low on sleep + carrying a baby.
You look absolutely radiant! Pregnancy really suits you, cant wait to see you as a mum :) x
You look so glowy and beautiful! So happy for you and your family! Wishing you all the best xx :)
This is my favorite series on YouTube right now, no exaggeration. I've watched you for years and I love seeing you and Mike and the dogs together. I can't wait to see your little girl added to the mix. You look beautiful and I'm so happy and excited for you!
Coming along nicely!  Waiting for your daughter and Lydia's wedding, ahhhh life is good!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
Fleur te ves Bella! You and Mike are going to be amazing parents so happy for you both!
You look so happy and it makes me happy! I'm smiling from ear to ear and I loved seeing your bump and the nursery : )
I've taken my belly button and \nNipple piercings out each of my 4 pregnancies......my skin went super tight so took it out fairly early doors!! I managed to put my jewellery  back I after! Where my piercing was Is my only stretch nstk!
Hey Fleur! I'm currently 20.5 weeks pregnant with my second and I remember the back and pelvis pain like it was yesterday. I highly recommend finding a Webster certified chiropractor to adjust you throughout the pregnancy. I used to think chiros were quacks but after the relief it gave me with my first I'm a huge believer!! You look so lovely, pregnancy definitely suits you well! 💓
Aww  you look absolutely beautiful, and you're positively glowing! Pregnancy suits you well 💕
I took mine out and I never put it back.
They make belly button piercing plastic jewelry that is longer than the normal barbell and plastic so it bends.
You are soooooo cute!!! You're really getting into it and it shows!! So joyful and confident and less worried!! So happy you are enjoying your pregnancy!! It's a beautiful thing!
You look absolutely amazing and just focus on having a Christmas baby and everything will be great!!!
You look simply blooming!! So glad you braved the naked baby bump, this will be great when you're looking back at the vlogs. I'm loving the baby vlogs too, she's a very lucky little lady to her you as her mummy ❤️, oh n mike as her daddy xxx
I took my belly bar out around 30 weeks, my son is 2 months old now and I haven't put it back in but it doesn't look like it's healed over, similar timings to you, I got it done when I was 17 and just turned 30. Definitely want to put it back in just haven't had the time to sort it out!
Fleur I'm so excited for you and your baby girl. You look so amazing. Hope you and Mike and the doggies are having a good day.
That color (sweater and lip) looks fantastic on you!
for pelvis pain - sleep with a pregnancy cushion between your knees so they'll be hip width separated - it saved me from sooo much pain (i'm due in 4 weeks, right now on bed rest.) Fun fact - i prepared for my wedding with your videos, got married same year as you, now i'm enjoying your pregnancy videos :)
When you first said niece I thought you ment Lulu, then I remembered your brother just had a baby. I was like that most be a good carrier if it can fit Lulu.
You're such a cute pregnant mommy! Very psyched for you bunch 💜
I had my belly button pierced.  I had to take it out when I was pregnant.  My belly button actually popped out, so no belly piercing for me :-)! Good luck with everything.  You have an adorable bump...so happy for you, Mike and the doggies!!!!
watch my music. It's so amazing
You make such a gorgeous pregnant person!! Always love seeing Squidge 😍😍😍😍😍
I am so excited for you and you look great!  You are just glowing. Love all of the little baby clothing.
I didn't take mine out until my belly button popped but then it was still okay.. eventually it got until 38 weeks with my first... then I took it out..... but my second I never had to as he was head down from 30 weeks and ready to go... so just see how u go ... she might be head down and have lots of room up top so u might not need to take it out at all :) lol that also does mean lots of feet in ribs tho ! Haha it's all fun :) u look great x
Lovely video - well done Fleur, v happy for you and so nice to see you so happy x
So happy for you! Your belly looks so cute! Watching your pregnancy videos always puts me in a good mood. I can't wait to have a baby one day.
Get a bioflex bar for your pregnancy, they're flexible and move with your body so will be really comfy Xx
Your dogs are so well behaved,they will be babies best friend and protector. Females are very loving,when baby cries or fusses they may put their chin/head on baby,it's what dogs do to their own pups to comfort them. A little pressure comforts them( like wrapping a baby like a burrito). Some people freak when dogs approach babies ,if you stay relaxed so will your dogs.. good luck and enjoy this time❤️
Fleur, you're looking amazing, your skin is absolutely glowing and these updates are ace. Really nice to hear about the journey of a mother-to-be. Really hope you'd proceed to do a delivery video and a new-mother video (the good, the bad and the ugly), once you've gotten into a routine of course. I feel not enough people talk about what its really like. xxx
I'm so so so happy that you showed the bump!!! I'm so happy we got to kinda see your little girl! Please keep up the pregnancy updates, they are so sweet and you just look so happy and glowing. I hope you decide to put sweet little one on your channel once she arrives! Your journey with her makes my heart happy. 💕
I am 19 weeks pregnant now and i love watching your updates 😁😁
My bellybutton piercing has been out for over 9 years. Can still put the piercing through the hole (I don't wear it anymore, but I clean it every now and then and test if it's still open). Take it out if it annoys you and you can just put it back later :)
Fleur you look beautiful!! I am soooo excited for you and Mike!!!!  🤗
You look lovely so happy for all of you
Fleur you look totally stunning! Might be weird but it makes me really happy to watch that bump and think that there's a baby YOUR BABY growing there!
That black babygrow is super cute! You don't usually see black baby clothes but that one totally works
You are glowing beautiful Mumma to be!! 😍 so great to see lovely! I'm 28 weeks. Loving sharing this journey with you xx
Gurl you look amazing! So beautiful and glowing!! You look so happy! Congrats! ❤️
I've heard great things about pre-natal chiropractic for pelvis/back pain!
You look beautiful. You are glowing! I'm so excited for you and Mike. Baby girls are the best. My baby is 24 now \nI took my belly button piercing out. It caught on everything. After I had my daughter I put it back in.
For both my pregnancies I took out my normal belly ring and put in the flexible plastic ring and it was no problems and it was comfortable till the end of my pregnancy. Then after I gave birth I just put my normal belly ring back. You are looking beautiful, enjoy your pregnancy. It's such a miracle 👶
I am so excited you got this cot!! :) I thought you'd love it. Great choice! <3 Loved this video, you're glowing.
Love this!! Wondersuits are the absolute best!!!
You genuinely are glowing and you look so blissfully happy
Has Fleur ever said what happened to her back when she was young? Talk about a stunning mother-to-be!
I have had lower back issues for years, and when I was pregnant I felt quite sore... so I'd recommend getting a gym ball Fleur, it was the best thing I could have ever purchased. It was impossible to get comfy on the couch etc and spent months draped over the ball! And the pain really kicked in when I was in labour, I swear the pain in my lower back overtook any other pain, the most comfy position was to lie with my fist right under my lower back (just above my bum) it was the only way to relieve my back pain whilst I was pushing. Sorry if that's a bit rambly but thought I'd share my experience of back pain + pregnancy x
Am I legit crazy for watching and enjoying these even though I'm not pregnant, or intend to be, and have no children. I'm so happy for you though Fleur, your and mikes joy is seriously contagious. Also please don't be self conscious, rock your bump and all that comes with it. Your growing a human being, so give yourself a break ☺️
I can father a child for your subscribers. Leave a message.
Aww, she's shy. So sweet. 😘
They have the CUTEST pregnancy belly button rings! Iv gotten them for several of my friends!

Shakira STILL === Goddess!!!
like si crees que el video no tiene ni pies ni cabeza NO TIENE sentido pero te gusta la canción
Mejor que chantaje\n\n\nLike si cres lo mismo
Soy él único que extraña a la antigua Shakira?
Vaya mierdaaa de canción. \nQue dios me perdone si no es así
Que cancion tan bonita perro fiel..
Sin duda la canción está pegajosa, pero que onda con Shakira se estancó en las mismas coreografías, esos movimientos ya me los se de memoria.
No sale de sus bailes Como endemoniandose ..bueno cada ves que baila ASI es poseida por un demonio pues es satanica
NADA deberia ser un single, que es la mejor del album...
Así de dorada me recuerda a Paulina Rubio, la chica dorada ...😍
si me gusto tamto la rola y el video mas
Shakira, ¿cuando vas a bailar normal? ._.
Que asco ...\nCuando shakira era original y no se vendía era genial... \n:/
El tema me encanta. El video no tanto, como que le faltó pimienta jaj
Te amooooooo 😍😍😍😍😍😍❤❤❤❤.  Todas tus canciones top ⏫ top.  Y esta mas.  Me encanta como mueves tu cuerpo.  💖💖💖💖
Ese cabello rojo me hace acordar tanto a la Shakira de antes 😍
Shakira como esta buen video 😢😢
Shakira como desde hace años, haciendo pura MIERDA!!!!!! Que triste que la considerada máxima exponente de la musica latina se dedique a hacer esta bazofia.
Como cuando me gusto antes y como me sigue gustando hoy🤗
Mas de lo mismo que wueba... Mismo baile de dario y mismo sonidito de reggaton .. Nunca volvera la shakira de los 90 esa si era una buena cantante .
me encantan sus bailes 😍 hay y nicky jam 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘😘
Woww..me encanta 😊😁d hace rato lo esperab..
Cada mas basica, no me gusta ya.
Sakila eles la mejor sigue asi
*Like si like*
❤️❤️❤️❤️💜💜💜💜
The never aging Shakira <3
Jada stevens??
Ahora los artistas pop hacen reggaeton cuando antes no lo hacían , es hora que El The Big Bos, El rey Don y Wisin y yandel salgan con reggaeton antiguo, no está mierda de estilo!!! POR FAVOR LES PIDO una canción Cómo :  Salió el sol - nadie Cómo tu - mírala bien .. Algo así no esté estilo comercial, no importan las visitas , Ustedes vuelvan a lo de antes.
Si eso pasa yo  seguire aqui contigo como perro fiel 😍🐶
Con sus movimientos me recordo al video con Alejandro Sanz
Todavía no puedo creer que Shakira tiene más de 40 años😭😍
Porque hay comentarios en inglés y el vídeo está en español
Like si te diste cuenta que es la primera vez que #Nicky sale en un  #videoclip sin #gorro ✌👀🎩😄🤠
De todas las que últimamente ha sacado, esta si me gusto jajaja
Ya pasó casi un día i ni va 4 millones 😪😪 y hay quien decía que iba romper su récord , shakira ya no rompe récords en YouTube
This is the new despacito
song is so meaningful and just so touching but video is meh
I love her since ever. But im not digging this new genre of her. She/her management can do better. She has one of the best voices in this generation. Think about bruno and adele. Still making good music without losing their art and identity. If Jessie J is pursuing a super different genre then people might lose interest because of inconsistency. She isn't like Beyonce YET to show different sounds songs after songs. I still believe in her and I hope she find her music and this is not just a phase of her being adventurous as an artist.
Or she's talking bout the industry
PEOPLE SHOULD STOP SLEEPING ON HER
I don't mind your booty, BUT not with expense of your attractive talent. When I see you, I want see your shining gift... the gift that makes you unique!\nGenerally any women's butt is an attraction... BUT! One is  NOT an unique ...
That Was truly amazing cant wait for the album hope its not her last
The queen !!! 👸🏼👸🏼👸🏼 so amazing !
In love with her all over again..*trueheartbeat
Why is Jessie J so underrated? : (\nShe deserves so much more.❤
She did not come to play. She came to slay
Miss you so much ❤️😻😻
She trapped by devil she could not get out she was in a satans spell that why she not made music long time this music is shit go back to ur holes
Who's listening to these song right now? Like or comment..
2:44 switch up and transition was too wavy 🌊
i didn't knew she uploaded a new mv haha 😍
Hey, please check out some of the original songs I've written on my channel, and let me know what you think!
I would like to know who Jessie J is speaking about with the lyrics, good she is venting. I like, and subtle vocals work well for the song too. Just something I notice though, Jessie J's clothing style still isn't working for me; something about it is way off and I like partial clothing and such however I like it to be stylish. Anyways great new song. I am sharing this. :-)
YOURE SO REAL! THIS MUSIC IS PERFECT!  • A R T •
Wtf is makin that sound in tha begin'in...ruins whole song!
Dyler gang is after you
I'm so happy that jessie is back with a new beautiful era
Anyone else notice the unintended hole(s) in the net stockings? They just kept disturbing me... 🤔
hey sweetheart ..\nI just wanna tell you a few thing ..\nno1 .. we'll always be proud of you whatever you achieve\n\nno2 .. we're so happy that you finally feel free , tell us who that was who hurt you and we'll eat him alive :-D\nI'm so sorry you got through all that pain , it kills me <3\n\n3 .. I don't care how much views or fame this album will get , as long as you consider it a new step in a new musical life I'll support you , till you find the \nway and learn from your downs and share with you your ups happiness ..\n\n4 and last .. consider this as a suggestion , or asking ..\nit's beautiful to do what you love , but never forget about your heartbeats that breath your voice every single day .. soul sounds amazing , calm is pretty nice ... but I saw in you that magical mix of soul and loud and power .. I saw in you reborn of Whitney Houston .. don't take from us that unbelievable powerful vocals and emotion and abilities ...\nsing soul keep calm .. but some times you gotta be louder so people and fans can hear you ..\nyou started this cause you love it , and to heal others .. we need your powerful voice to be healed ...\nI listen to purple rain , I have nothing , titanium covers of yours ... I realized that you're much more than pop singer ..\n\nat the past they forced you to do certain type of music .. don't let their bad memories force you to the reverse type ...\n\nI feel you're much relieved now , that's make me happy .. but I can't feel you free yet ...\n\nthe world needs your gift jess , needs your big heart and love , your unlimited strength and fighting soul ... please use your gifts , writing calm and loud singing big heart deep emotions ... with all the power and passion you have , to make it reach all the world\n\nshow the world who you are .. and what you're capable of .. you'll beat that commercial silly dolls in a blink of an eye ...\n\nyou're a real artist , that's why I'll never give up believing that you'll be a legend .. when you set all your passion and abilities free ..\n\nlove from middle east <3 <3\n\np.s ... whatever you choose I'll always be a big huge giant heartbeat :-D
She's so giving me beyonce feels!!!! This is so hot 🔥🔥🔥
Can someone copy n paste the lyrics?
i like the song of jessie j
Tomorrow might not come\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about that
Just when I was thinking about... where Jessie J went. This is easily her best song since Who You Are. I’m SHOOK.
Yaaas Queen!!!! Fucking slay forever, i love so much foreva and eva, the BEST Idol ever!! You fucking QUEEN you are SO SO perfect 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love it, another work of art as always.
It seems that she's telling a true story.
F*cking become a  prostitute by the looks of it.  Shit sounding song anyway!
Girllllllllllllllll, it's about time!!!!!
Jessie this was amazing! But is she going to do emotional songs anymore like she used to? \n I liked them.. 💛
The Realest Song I've Heard Since Lauren Hill X Factor!
This song is amazing! She is slaying the game right now! ❤️
It must be my 20th time listening to it today. This one is a gem Jessie !!
The artistry is amazing!!!! Love you Jessie💚💚
While watching this, I continued to think about whether or not I'm actually gay. So sexually confused. I also loved the song. Can't wait for the album!!
Dont know how to feel, this is definitely a new side we havent seen of Jessie....
That was incredible!\n\nLove you so much 💖🙌
This song needs a fuckin Grammy
This song is dedicated to herself.\nShe is very classy... I can´t believe it
Your ass brings me to press replay button, Jessie!
I love Jessie J with her soul 😘😘😘

Siempre me ha gustado Jessie y La verdad es decepcionante, ya no me había gustado la primera canción de este nuevo disco...y esta es peor...y el video...aburrido y chabacano...lastima desperdiciar el talento natural de Jessie con canciones tan aburridas y olvidables
Te quiero mucho, saludos desde Colombia, para mi eres la mejor :) ;) Excelente canción.❤😍😘😍🤗
Toda ella es hermosa 😍
taylor swift is so overrated
Que hino da porra, bicho!
Essa mulher arrasa muito ♥ merece muito mais reconhecimento!
GARAGE MOVEMENTS!!!! THIS WAS WAYYYY TO WAVEYYY
props to the singers, shes phenomenal
The guy on keys🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Amazing cover by Romelu Lukaku.
Beautiful & brilliant.
that lead singer is so sick omg
Fucking vibe... this is what happens when you integrate two genres into one
Wow amazing!! That girls vocals are amazing!!
😂 Yo he killed it
Loooooove this cover! \nThe instrumentalists an singers killed it!
Sweet like stormzy
He bossed this 🔥 🔥
Is that a mic in his hand or Corbyn's member ?
Stormzys shit n jus ruined classic... More like wank n big foot now!
Shes got a smooth voice made for ukg
TF IS HE TALKING ABOUT RETARDED
The best in the world at what he does
Bloke on the bass was smooth af
Tbh the singers made this tune
Reminds me of being a child again da da da da dada da sweet like chocolate 🍫
Waste. Dead \n\nOriginal buries this. Not even in the same galaxy
It makes it so much better to watch when the artist is genuinely enjoying the performance. Even better that you can tell he's just in awe of the backup singer.
Why the drummer wearing 2 pairs of headphones tho?
Stormzy is dead... Doing a dizzee and going lightweight, all about Dave and AJ atm
40 years old & loving it like this reminiscing on my old garage days...yesssssss
I beg he drops this on Spotify!
What an incredible cover. Stormzy is a true tour de force.

Big up the drummer keeping that beat moving , stormzy flowed on this like a jet ski, the vocalists brought that garage authenticity , pianist brought flavour the whole production was a danger!
Love this! He's so so talented. Had the pleasure of meeting him last week. Vlog on my channel 🖤
Ngl stormzy fell off but this is calm
This man can do no wrong! Nice vibez!
I like Stormzy, but I lost a lot of respect for him when he started doing songs with the likes of Little Mix... Like when Ludacris did music with Bieber
didn't know Romelu Lukaku could rap like this
I felt like i was listening to Biggie's shit! fucking dope bruv!
Loved this and Stomzy looked like he was enjoying himself too.....fire in the park!

Is this the guy who cried racist because police raided a heroin dealer during notting hill carnival and his response was what about Glastonbury? They don't raid white people events!\nSoooooooo\n1. Dealing heroin is cool and perfectly ok\n2. The fact they found copious amounts of heroin is ignored and they are just racist\n3. Glastonbury? Really?! Yeah I'm sure a lot of posh toffs are shooting up while watching Coldplay spew out boring wank!\n4. So he's calling for more drug searches at ALL outdoor events and festivals?\nWTF is this guy on?!! This cretin stoops to new levels of blind ignorance, delusions, victim complexes and hypocrisy!
Smashed it ! better than the original and the women on the vocals AMAZING VOICE!

I live in Australia and I didn't know what half those things meant
More than 100 stealth egg attacks baffle one Euclid homeowner and police (photos and video) EUCLID, Ohio -- An 85-year-old Euclid man's home has become the target of mysterious egging attacks that began in March 2014 and haven't stopped. The continuous onslaught of eggs has baffled police, neighbors and local government officials who have tried and failed to identify the source of the attacks that have ruined the man's home and kept his family on edge. The accuracy is phenomenal, Albert Clemens, Sr. said. Because almost every time when it's nice weather and they launch five or six of these at a time, they almost invariably hit the front door. Clemens green two-story house sits on the corner of Wilmore Avenue and East 210th Street. He and his wife bought the home as newlyweds about 60 years ago. Though his wife has since passed away, Clemens still lives there with his 49-year-old daughter and 51-year-old son. The house has been pelted with eggs several times a week -- sometimes more than once a day -- for the past year. The attacks always happen after dark and last around 10 minutes each. The family has been awoken as late as 2 a.m. by what sounds like the crack of a gunshot against the aluminum siding or front door. Clemens and police believe the eggs are being launched from a block or two away. The siding on the front of Clemens' home is destroyed, splattered with dried egg residue that stripped off the paint. Other than a few rogue eggs that hit nearby homes, no other neighbors have been targeted. Somebody is deeply, deeply angry at somebody in that household for some reason, Euclid Lt. Mitch Houser said. Winter offered a short respite for the family, as the egging became less frequent during the cold weather. But both Clemens and police anticipate the attacks picking back up as the snow and ice thaw. An unsolved mystery Euclid police have not taken the investigation lightly. They've spent a year doing undercover stakeouts, canvassing the neighborhood and even sending eggshells for testing. The department's entire community policing unit was dedicated to tracking down the eggers at one point. Officers respond quickly to every egging call at the home -- which is less than a mile from the police station. Both Clemens and detectives are at a dead end when it comes to suspects. Clemens had suspicions about a young man across the street who confronted him a couple years ago and asked him to stop calling police about suspicious activity in the neighborhood. Clemens said that he had started calling police more often as he noticed more crime -- mostly suspected drug activity. Another neighbor Clemens suspected was ruled out when officers saw him standing outside as an attack occurred in the presence of police. Investigators have taken several different approaches to nabbing the eggers, including installing a surveillance camera on the house. Detectives even collected some eggshell samples and tested them in a crime lab. The eggs were traced back to a local Amish farm, but the trail ended there. Clemens says the culprits either have access to a large supply of eggs or are stealing them from businesses that throw them out when they go bad. Detectives have followed this thread, visiting local restaurants and businesses asking about missing eggs. They've also tried collecting fingerprints from eggshells, but Houser said that's an impossible task. When an egg breaks, it releases proteins that destroy DNA. Officers have gone door to door questioning neighbors and handing out fliers. Nobody has come forward with any tips. The person or people who are doing it have remained very tight-lipped apparently, Houser said. I would imagine it would be hard to keep a secret of something that had been done hundreds of times and for nobody to step forward to talk about it. The guilty parties don't appear to be intimidated by police interest in the case. An officer last year was taking a report when a barrage of eggs was launched at the house. One hit him in the foot. Houser said he's never seen this level of vandalism in his 20 years of police work. It's frustrated the whole department, which has dedicated hundreds of hours toward solving the egging mystery. The man hours put into that investigation were huge and one of the reasons it's so frustrating that we don't have somebody right now that we can criminally charge, Houser said. The culprits will face charges of felony vandalism and criminal damaging, Houser said. Additional charges could be tacked on if investigators find evidence that the attacks are a hate crime. The search continues Clemens is waiting until the perpetrators are caught before he repairs the tarnished siding. His insurance company is refusing to settle a claim until the guilty party is found. He said he used to clean up after each attack, but it became so frequent that he couldn't keep up. Police initially offered a $500 reward for information, but bumped it up to $1,000 after nobody came forward. That money is still up for grabs. We're not going to let it go, Houser said. We'll continue to put effort into it until we figure something out. Despite all the torment, Clemens said he'd never consider moving from his beloved home. I like the neighborhood, Clemens said. I like the city of Euclid. I would live and die in this house -- but it's been kind of a nightmare.
come over to geelong,Victoria
He was in Sydney senpai was like 2 hours away from me nooooo
Drawing with jazzy is the drawing form of gordan ramsey

I like how Tom has a gymshark hoodie on but he never goes to the gym ;)
you should set up a 'shit cam' live stream to catch the cat that is shitting on the sofa.
It's more like Mass than Mats, so.. Mads is pronounced kind of like Mass, just, quicker
My brother has 4 types of tendencies in his shoulders because he's pulled them out multiple times. I've pulled both out twice. Funnnnnn.

The return of Lydia
The Movie IT is just chapter 1
The film wasn't made to be scary as hell..it was made to tell the story of the losers club! Like in the bloody book. Getting right tired of people seeing this film because they thinks it's just another horror film. It's so much more than that
Every month for two week bless him

You need to buy covers for that sofa.
Ever had a needle in your eyeball? Not so painful as they sedate the skin, but I never forgot the grape being punctured. All for eye lasering...

I'm sorry, the diagnosis is you're a lying piece of shit. A literal scum of the earth. The only remedy is to payback the money you stole.\n\nGuess I'm gonna die then doc?\n\nHopefully - I mean yes, probably.
Who do the doodoo
Does anybody else have trouble loading the merch link. I've been trying to get a sweatshirt for days but the link won't work.
For real tho, maybe you should chill with the twitch sub shoutouts. I get that it's something nice you want to do for loyal twitch fans (and keep doing it if you do please) but as someone whose been watching since when LoT was Syndicate Central, it's kind of annoying and disrupts the vlogs...
I tore a ligament in my knee almost a year ago and it was meant to be healed months ago but I still have to get an MRI scan
What movie did he watch?
Hello Tom if that happens don't eat pig lots or ever

Lol @trending getting triggered, luv ya Tom
Congrats Tom you are 3rd on trending
You look like oli white
Tbh I like needles in my body it feels weird but it's satisfying.
Watching from A&E with a broken collarbone 😅 I watched the whole vlog twice 😂

Jeez, this guy still vlogs?
4th on trending wow 👌
#4 trending gg tom
Why is everyone hating on Tom and the video because it's trending? It just means a lot of people are watching it that's it.
Uhhhh why do people hate this guy?...
The iPhone 7 plus 256 gb is $1000
to make your cats stop pooping on the sofa, get another cat litter box. Cats usually prefer their own litter box and if they are pooping on your sofa, they're letting you know.\n1
You need to take some editing classes to make your vids more exciting to watch
Yo tom you need to start telling off the kittens and 'punishing' them for doing bad things, not punishing badly just like telling them off and stuff. We did it to our cat and now it hasn't shit on the Sofa for like 3 years
For anyone who replies to this is tom married it's been years since I've watched him so if I could please get a answer that would be great thanks
When they say 1000 pound is heaps for the iphone, its 1800 here
This vlog was uploaded on my 18th but was too drunk to watch it so i am watching it now.
Just how credible is an Indian medical certificate? It seems every GP in England is an Indian who did their medical studies in India.
I hope your entire life falls apart and you take your loved ones down with you when this pathetic venture of yours falls in and dies you spastic mindless leech, what fucking human trash, hearing your obnoxious hole spew meaningless vapid trash makes me fucking wince
These comments are disgusting, Syndicate donates money to charity and helps people, then you guys be pricks. Btw 3 of the people so far are Jake paulers, cancer.

Is it just me or the views are slow?
The fact that she brought up acid been thrown around like it was just an everyday occurrence shows you the state of the country right now.
These attacks have happened so many times over in Europe that everyone is getting used to them. did you hear, another terrorist attack in London, could you pass the butter Marge.
Why are people still recording vertically?
I how long it'll be before the BBC disable the comments
I thought maybe someone was throwing acid.  Nope, just someone attempting to detonate a powerful explosive in an enclosed space.  some people...
FACT: Islam is NOT a religion.\nFACT: Islam is a Godless, apostate murdering death cult, DISGUISED as a religion.\nFACT: Muhammad was a FALSE Prophet and Allah is a pagan moon god!\nFACT: Jews and Christians DENY that Muhammad was an Abrahamic Prophet of God!\nFACT: The koran is a forgery.  It was copied from the Holy Bible.
Let me guess, a man with some permutation of the name Mohammed was upset about living  in a tolerant country that protects by law, mollycoddles & nurtures his ideology.
a human stampede followed by some apathetic clowns filming a bucket wrapped in a bin bag with a tiny little flame on it through a train door window.\n\nThey're not even trying to make these things real anymore
Why is this trending with only 64k views
this is a sad day for England and the injured people will need at least 6 months off work to recover from this,  there was allot of smoke and a loud bang,  as some people had their ears bandaged in other videos and this alone is a 7k payout ,
So BBC who did it ? Oh that's right fake news .
Open Borders and Empathy for Terrorist does Not keep them from Killing You. #DrainTheSwamp

How long are you folks going to take this shit????

Genocide is happening in rohingya and the news turning a blind eye. A bucket on fire on a train and the news blows up. What messed up world we live in.
22-05-13 Lee Rigby Killing in London\n22-03-16 Brussel, France Attacks\n22-07-16 Munich Attack\n22-03-17 London,Uk Attack\n22-05-17 Manchester Attack \n22year old suicide bomber,22 people killed,Took place on 22nd May? \n\n15th/ 09/17 Parson Green Underground London Bombing 22 Injured again! Number 22!\n\nIs this just a coincedence??? Or we to blind to see?? Few days after Donald Trump travels to saudi for a $110 billion arms deal just few days before and on the same day of the Manchester attack he is in Israel the Land of the Zionists? \n\nThe date of these attacks are so blatent! If this such a real planned attack im sure the Anti-Terrorists officer,FBI,CIA  etc would have been well prepepared for these attacks heck they are more intellegent than us! instead they are Post-Terrorist officers after attacks are done only then they will do real police work to keep the mankind safe.\n\nCan you not see the Pattern the only question remains now is \n22-10-17??\n\nPlease forward to make people aware of this.
All those people who complain about being horribly burned and blown up are racist Islamophobes.  Saying that makes me a good person. :)  I am so good.
Wow the second time around on her interview she's much better, why does she have the back of her hands covered?
Can it get any more scripted. Wtf. Fake as f@#k liars. What a joke. LMFAO. You people are so rediculous. Who believes this crap.
what a liar...NOBODY was hurt during this false flag staged event...what a joke...
There were two woman underneath me and I thought something exploded in this mans pocket😅😂🤣. Bla, bla, bla. We don't know what happened. We were told to run away. We heard screams. And more lost shoes😑
Still think islam is a wonderful religion? Deport them
MY SYMPATHY I HOPE THEY LEARN  SOMETHING ENGLISH PEOPLE  ?WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR YOUR COUNTRY ? WAKE UP
Emma stevie is a proper old fulham slag ...., ask anyone lol
Another reason to drive instead of using mass transit.
Look it up: Emma Stevie is a actress and model.... would give her a 7 out of 0-10 scale, for her performance.
Let's not jump to conclusions folks, the perpetrator could be from any number of world relig.. and its Muslims.
The Who were from  SHEPPARDS BUSH.......................
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB4OIjDijqM\n\nRead the comments - people i know were there and there was no such thing
the people running do more harm than the attacks...
No explosion = fake news, watch for fake 22 injured actors on scene
typical londoners, look out for number one london does not represent the british people any other town city would help
this is god's way of punishing England for the many sins of the Beattles !   gods wrath us upon England for the Beattles satanic music clearly heard , satan is god  when played backwards at 45 rpm !!!!  more migrants to England please
OK, get out your candles, vigil at 7pm tomorrow, Make sure some nijabs \nare in your selfies and instrgram pix. Then down the pub. Repeat.
Can't believe the District Line was not this time. How does someone be so idiotic to try and do that on the system. Please be safe. Especially on the District Line today
Seems like another lie... another made up story for the masses.
This is what your news reports report? You Brits are weird.
One day after Westminster bridge attack one us pilot killed 175 Iraqi Civilians in Iraq , now In Order to target 175 people how many target you must hit to kill 175 people it was not accident it was deliberate
The girl in pink is world famous now...she will be in a movie..will get a book deal. write a book...become a porn star...be at super market openings and dine with the royals...she will commended for her bravery and given a medal..she will be a millionaire by XMAS.
I was waiting until the picture showed
False Flag if you cant see it you are part of the problem they are not even trying to make it look real anymore.
It's another false flag, these people are all crisis actors with the same script.
I read the title of the video incorrectly. Can you guess what I thought it said?
That's some amount of shit n piss that was rolling down your chin there. Can you sleep at night?😂you must be on holiday by now with the LOOT. 😆
this world needs love
The UK is owned by Zionists, the Rothschilds etc. Don't be a dumb fuck. These are all carried out by Mossad, the MI5 MI6. All you illiterate idiots assuming it's the scapegoats Muslims are stupid af.
its a good job they are so shit at making bombs in general.
YOU ARE BRAINWASHED BY THE JEWS. Govern = gubernare = latin = TO CONTROL, ment = mens = latin = MIND.

Wow what a nice story about a shoe! Amazing reporting. BBC found 1 genuine passenger and a second woman who wasn't there but gave a shoe to a woman who was running away!
The attacked has been named as Sam Hyde
I stop watching at 3:27 there no reasom to watch it after that
So you ran for no reason? Idiots
A bucket with a small flame and no smoke damage on the side of the seat?
Nice that she felt so sorry for all the people she was trampling over!
Can't believe these morons are whinging. This is multiracialism - Enjoy ha ha
Ok I don’t want to say this rn but she gorgeous
Londonistan is so much better with muslims.
Personally I only run when I hear or see an actual reason to run lol. You mean I could start a stampede by yelling run with a bunch of guys?
We all know who is doing these cowardly acts but the main stream media nor the likes of Corbyn will actually come out and say it so they  avoid being seen as racist or Islamaphobic  .
What the hell is this about? Has there been an attack? Or has a phone exploded? And if so... uhh... what kind of phone was it?
They're going to catch him and give him refugee status.
Ask yourself this question:\n\nHow do Muslims in the middle east, UK or any other Western country benefit from staging these types of attacks?\nI mean, it's pretty apparent at this point that these Terror attacks will only ever lead to more bombs and drones flying over head for them so why would they continue to do this? \n\nIs it not a little bit concerning that the stock prices for Defense Contractors, Surveillance Companies, Weapons Manufacturers and other Wall Street monstrosities always seem to do better off the back of a terror attack? \nOr am I just being paranoid for thinking that the people who actually benefit from this might be the ones we  should be looking more closely at. Not a group of people being killed in their thousands each and every single day by our humanitarian love bombs.
When are we going to all agree that Islam needs to go?\nIt's a lot easier to deal with this now rather than ten years down the line when there are twice as many of them.
SHE IS A SEXY HUMAN
Who's ordered the sausage rolls and panninis for the COBRA meeting.
They were told to run! Same in every false flag operation
This is the fault of Muslims. Not just the terrorists but those who were witness to the terrorists radicalization...which looks a lot like taking Islam seriously.
This video reminds me the new Dr who is coming.
well just another one day in UK it will never finish it will be all the time like that, It will be scary to be in bus or underground from now politicians they will cover this nicely and  life goes on again if you die it will only bring sadness to close family next day it will be normal day.We all know who cause it but like British white will never admit to do anything hypocrites, well when Brexit will start I assume it is gonna be worse than now in the locked country some of them will loose passports i wish non of you will be  on a day of similar attack like 7/7
TOTAL ZIONIST HOAX AS PER USUAL!!!! Timing was great 👍 to see bag still on fire 🔥 22 people injured!? Like Manchester hoax 22 people on 22 May by 22 yr old  Muslim 🤕! Yeah right! If someone can take me to a person in their hospital bed and show me their injured I'll give them a thousand pounds 💷 TOTAL ZIONIST FREE MASON BULLSHIT FOR THE ORWELLIAN SOCIETY OF POLICE 👮 STATES 24 HOUR SURVEILLANCE AND RANDOM BAG CHECKS!!!! Watch George Orwell's 1984 on YouTube pref black and white 1956 version and you'll see everything he predicted has come true!
Let's not start talking about Muslim's and terrorism here pls, we all know what today was! FAKE scripted manipulated terror BS staged by crisis actors! Sorry to be so BLUNT!
Like Hillsborough? What an insult to those victims!
This is so sad. I can't imagine how frightened those people must have been.
infelizmente estes embargos e falsas intenções causa tudo isto...espero que as famílias das vitimas consigam superar as perdas
Eh, iPhone X exploded
Absolute bullshit , 22 injured ,  lidl bag survives with no injuries

*Have no fear illuminate is here*
another staged event  with crisis actors ...who is buying  this bullshit ?
How many attacks have there been in the US since Trump took over? Hmmm. Maybe you guys need Trump.
When are WESTERN LEADERS going to connect the DOTS leading right to the HATE TEACHINGS of ISLAM ?   The HATE TEACHING IMAMS  & Hate teaching Islamic Schools ??    It is not rocket science !!!   Yet NOT ONE COWARDLY LEADER will go anywhere near this UTTERLY ANTI DEMOCRATIC & ABUSIVE IDEOLOGY called ISLAM ???
she was stepping on everyone she could to save your ugly self  i look down as im stepping on her, i said youl poor thing looks like you didnt have a problem not in shock or stress
No crowds were injured during the filming of the mustang scene.
more things;\n The lyrics are referencing a lot of things. Probaly half of the things in this song are refs. Here's all I know, feel free to add more:\n\n*_Spinning around you_*\nFavorite records: _I'll spin for you like your favorite records used to_\n\n*_You were too good to be true_*\n*_Gold plated_*\nGolden: _How cruel is the golden rule_\n                _When the lives we lived are only golden-plated?_\n\n*_You're just the last of the real ones_*\nChampion: Just the music video here, the video shows people living in fake realities. And it ends with ending the fakes. So this could be a ref to that.\n\n*_My head is stripped just a screw that's been tightened too many times_*\nDisloyal order of buffaloes: _I’m a loose bolt of a complete machine_\n\n*_I'm here at the beginning of the end_*\nYoung volcanoes: _We’re the beginning of the end_\n\n*_I'm done with having dreams_*\nChampion: I'm not sure about this one but this is the opposite of _I got nothing but dreams inside, I got nothing but dreams_ , Maybe saying that he's moving away from dreaming and wants to actually start doing things\n\nAdd more and I'll put em here
If you could marry a song, I would marry this one
So if Pete is the last of the real ones, and now he's killed, the llamas rule?
I'm so proud of my boys it's amazing 😩 \nAnyone noticed that it sounds kinda similar to the new sleeping with sirens songs?
Well that was a let down.

Liked Young and Menace Liked champion not quite sure about this though
WHAT IS WITH THE FLIPPING LLAMAS
The best part is the Llamas hitting Pete with that shovel. It relaxes me for some reason. Lol
if '10 Ke$ha and '05 A7F had a kid..
Those credits are amazing props to Patrick's hand
Stunts by Patrick's hand, catering provided by not bad Joe, Ikea monkey provided by Andy these credits are a scream haha

At 3:39 tucked into the credits it says take the pain and make it build up 🤔
Why are they doing that?!!!!
You have to thank George RR Martin and his books for the thing you just watched.
2:51 I am pretty sure that Stannis wasn't the first one had sex on that table
I wish Viserys was still alive
Why is the Apple commercial guy commenting a Game of Thrones video?
1:25 Seems like an opportune time to make out
This would actually be a good video to show someone before they start watching game of thrones for the first time.
i could watch a 10hr straight movie of this
Is the Doom an allegory for Nuclear Weapons? The doom fell... Heat that could melt a dragon in flight...\nHmmm...
is it gonna be a series on it,or it was just...>\n?
Worst Animation ever. I preferred the other ones they made with the book-like animation
Those who would like to see more, here's ab unofficial but solid and well made episode : https://youtu.be/QVFDOdhVAJg
Is this narrated by Harry Lloyd (Viserys actor)?
Why is learning this history so much easier than learning history in class?
Any RWBY fans getting World of Remnant vibes from this epic video?
When is there going to be more?
How many Aegons are there exactly??
I love this so much.
I wonder if the Doom of Valyria was somehow caused by the white walkers as a preemptive strike of some sorts.
Thanks for helping us cope while you write, film, and edit the last great season
Errr actually the house that becomes beratheon that has the stag never had crown round its neck that was changed when roberts rebellion took the throne from the mad king

I noticed that Viserys was the one narrating the video lol
It would be nice if u add subtitles. Auto generated subtitles are confusing. Hope u consider to add subtitles from next video...
I WANT MORE!!!!!! WE GOTTA KNOW THE HISTORY!!
Brilliant! I don't know whose voice this is, but I want this very talented person to record an audiobook version of the game of thrones! Make it Happen HBO!
Amazing!!! Really nice video.\n\nPlease make this a TV show, Doom of Valyria, Aegon's Conquest, I need this so bad.
This was so good! Great job to whoever made it.
Bran Stark goea to the past and whispers in the air of Mad King Burn Them All\nthat's how he became mad...\nI guarantee you this will happen..
Meh sister fuckers the whole lot of them.
For those wondering Sophie Turner will be doing the Stark chapter. Yes I know it sucks, Sean Bean would've a much better choice.
That was fucking fantastic!!  Please do the Dance with Dragons  next!!
What is the name of the soundtrack around 2:50?
Aegon of the house targaryen first of his name th conqueror and fucker of his sisters 😍😂✌
The animation style is all over the place.
It's a gr8 work.... Plz make more animes on this....
Make a fucking GAME OF THIS GOD DAMN IT!!!!!!! GO GET FUCKING CD PROJEKT RED TO MAKE A GAME OUT OF THE BOOKS OR SOMETHING!!!!!!!!
was this before or after the romans?
Keep releasing this kind of stuff!!!, we love it. Keep me happy until the new and final season😭😭
I don't watch and I know absolutely nothing about Game Of Thrones, but this video was awesome.  I love how descriptive and artistic they were with explaining the history of this world, and the art and music as well. Everything was put together to create an epic atmosphere. It's really good.
im applying for college, should i take animator or graphic designer? after watching this video i wanted to be an animator
Why make an animated series, when you can just make this a series after game of thrones ends? Prequel$$$$$$$$
An actual series on this like GOT would be amazing but I think we need something about the first men and the children of the forest and the first war with the night king and construction of the wall would be nice and then a series on the fall of valyria and rise of the aegon
Why is there dragons with arms and legs ?
Now I want an anime version of GoT can somebody please do that i am begging.
We want a animated movie of this goddamn
2:52 she could get this dick right there
Who wants to see a Game of Thrones animated series? 🙋
Great video, the only thing is that there is a mistake in the Durrandon's sigil. There is a crown in it and the crown was added by Robert Baratheon after taking the kingdom. \nI hope to see more
+gameofthrones When will this animated collection, Conquest and Rebellion, be available for sale on Amazon Video ?
I wish Daenerys narrates a lore. I know she's a bit overrated but just ONCE she gets a chance to narrate. Viserys is dead. Of coarse, I do like this video though.
So I'm pretty sure this is being narrated by Rhaegar.
Wasn't the Reach the oldest of the seven kingdoms?
I couldn't wait for the History and Lore from Season 7.......finally 7.😀😀👌
Finally after all that ghetto design crap we get something worth watching.
check out this AMAZING  rock version of Got https://youtu.be/tbNdyQB8FkA
Holy shit this is beautiful.\n\n\nWe need one like this for the whole A World of Ice and Fire book
So if I buy the season on XBOX one then I don't get this? Guess I'm not buying. Hate DVD
This MUST be a spin off of Game of Thrones one day, along with Robert rebellion and Greyjoys rebellion. Please, just do it.
Is this the voice actor for viserys?
i hope one of the spin-offs will be about the doom of valyria
next episode make the animation more fluid please
Who is the narrator?
I look forward to downloading it for free on December 13th!
I always enjoy westerosi animations!!! Great storyline.. Rich history behind everything!! Genius stuff
Is this a hint of an Aegon's Conquest sequel? :o
You better stop right now before we have to wait another two years for the next animated video like season 8. Stop it.
what did they use to animate this a\n game cube?
Oh my god this animation is laughably bad.
Was this made on the same engine that made Myst 25 years ago?
I'm sure this is gonna reach #1
*I'm the creator of this video! Come check me out! Thanks!!*\n_Sister did the animation._\n_Brother did the voice over_\n_Older sister did the music_\n_Credits thanks to HBO_\nI LOVE YOU SO MUCH FOR GETTING MY WORK OUT THERE!! <3
Eai brasileirinhos manjadores de inglês, façam uma legenda pra isso, pls .-.

I love this!
Targaryens-best family of Game Of Thrones
https://youtu.be/fqCGgDM9-bk watch this beast
Viserys sounds nicer in his narration. :)
Wow!
Is this narrated by Rhaegar?
Yes. Just, yes.
VALYRIAN MASTER RACE

Omg 😲 need more 🤤
OMFGGG WIG FLEW TO WESTEROS IT LOOKS AMAZING

Damn! @2:55 Aegon's sisters are so damn hoooot!!!

House Whore Ass

Hasta cuando boy a esperar la 8 temporada 😠 😠 😠
Arnold gettin ran over from a car going 200 mph
Here before your channel hits 1 million subs
Give more right now !!!
Send Arnold to Titan Saturns moon next\n\nDisclaimer:I forgot what planet titan is a moon to.
Its funny and its good. all vedios is very good
Hey anold can i have a test can HUMAN life in JUPITER just one second please
Haaaa they almost did it right until the last part when arnold explode and it made a sound... there is no sound in space you morons!
Arnold in Counter Strike: Global Offensive
How to survive being hanged?
Get him to the past
I love seeing this because so many fucking shows and movies make people freeze in space which is so stupid
what happens if an 45 m anaconda eats arnold.
how long can he survive *I R M A*
Throw Arnold in North Korea
why does this have sound effects of gobstopper gobbler?
Unm \nYou said\nYou have *no oxygen* so you can't be protected and you will see burns appearing on the unprotected part of your body, and your worst fear is the lack *of oxygen.* 
Just found this channel... pretty interesting lol
Wow, so if I was in space for a few seconds I would be fine!
Why does Arnold's finger always fall off?
I'm glad this is a thing
So glad that I met Arnold. :) 😊😊
make swallow a bunch of pills thinking they are a treat for the last video. then explain how overdosing works and what he would have to do to survive it
Gets 300k in a month
Put Arnold in world war 2
What if Arnold os actually a person that actually goes though these things every video thats made and cannot ever die but only love in eternal suffering
What if we teleport Arnold inside Arnold?
Ok story line so far he fell out a plane without a parishoot the he landed in snow and freezed to death then he got teleported on the sun and then he got trapped in quicksand and then got buried alive and got shot and then a radioactive leapered bit him and he got super powers and then he tried them out and he got burnt from running at the speed of light the he got lost in space. I hope for a black hole next time
What would happen if u got a heart attack
These videos should be considered Arnold abuse
Being Arnold is worst than being in hell
wait, 10 seconds after he was in space, he was alive, he was hyperventilating while doing it, and while his finger was lost, nothing more was damaged... can't believe i am saying this, but he should have died a lot more than he did.
How about how to survive at the bottom of the ocean
Whelp. He's dead.\nAt least he can respawn.
What if he eat to much
Plzzz more episode \nLike lost in universe
I liked and subscribed
yo Arnold you are lucky man you never die.Yeah i like your videos.
THX! I'll keep this in Mind next time I go to space without a spacesuit!!
Which software you use for animation?
Arnold never returned to the Earth. He became half-mineral, half-human and floated forever through space. And though he wished for death, he was unable to die. So eventually, he stopped thinking.
Can you make more videos 😃
in all the videos  arnold losees a finger
PLZ MAKE MORE VID LIKE IF YES.    PLZ MAKE MORE VIDS ARNOLD

SEND ARNOLD TO THE BOTTOM OF THE MARIANNA'S TRENCH
Ah thats what that sound was.. no... There is no sound in space because sound is a compressive wave that needs a substance like air to propagate.
How long can you stay underwater?
what if Arnold got frozen in a block of ice?
Too much shit for Arnold
Can I Get 10 Likes For My Birthday....And Plz Wtch Will Magnet Work In SpaCe In My Chann
how long can arnold stay underwater without drowning?
Put him in the middle of the ocean
I feel sorry for Arnold he should be given a treat!
And then he falls into the Mariana Trench where he gets swallowed by a whale.
Dude this no 30 on trending and has over a million views
What if arnold lives in a town surviving a nuclear aftermath.
What happens when you get eaten by an animal, eg sharks, tigers, lions
What if Arnold will fall into a black hole?!?!😅😅
Arnold should go to back in time to the Jurassic period like so he can see
Be ready Arnold more challenges are waiting for you
Make more of these they are cool

Hey guys plz sub for a sub back and my mom says that if i get to 50 or more subs she will quit smoking
I want to kiss him
There is only one IT and that's Tim Curry
Dayum I'd *float* right on that daddy
am I the only one laughing because his brother is called Gustav?😂
OMG THATS HOW HE DOES THE SMILE?!? I've been able to do that since I was a kid!! All my siblings just thought it was weird or creepy!! Now I'm proud I'm able to do that too!
His eyes turn naturally to opposite directions. Creepy
Would of been a good joker.
SHE WOULDN'T EVEN HURT A FLY

any one date with me . Come to MY KIK = jiniadefoe69. I'm always there.
Are we just going to ignore the fact that this dude just ripped off CORNHOLIO?
You say you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN start casting American actors for American movies. Prove it or just shut the hell up about it.
This guy could play the joker.
skarsguard you are a genius!!!
this guy would make a great jarod leto joker replacement.
Who else was tryna do the lip thing?
I tried to smile like that but it looked like I was in pain, terrible pain.
I want him to give me a red balloon
It's the eyes, chico
He is so handsome
Yo i didn't know he just did the lip thing at will. I thought his pointed bottom lip was from special effects or makeup XD damn
This is the guy we need as the joker
Am I the only one who thinks DC should hire him to play The Joker? like retcon the Leto/Suicide Squad Joker as a fake or Jason Todd or just pretend he never happened and have Bill Skarsgård be the Joker from now on. I mean he's got the right build, a unique (joker like) face and a creepy smile. He did an amazing murderous clown already in It (which BTW is also a Warner Bros movie) and since he's relatively new in Hollywood he's probably cheaper than Leto.  just think it might be a good idea.
the demonic smile is okay, but I just don't like the lazy eyes
That's not a demonic smile \nThat's just my uncle when he's alone with me
He should be The next joker
if you think he looks like a ordinary Swede you are wrong.. a Swede nowadays are a hairy Muslim Arab or Somalian.. no blonds left.. grasp that
He is handsome though clowns scare the f out of me
So this guy is going to be world famous for having a stupid ass smile?
HE IS THE NEW GRINCH
i wonder what his brother thinks of being the brother of pennywise the dancing clown...
he looks like the human version pennywise
If anyone one subscribes to my channel I will promise you that I will sub back I might sub back like right away but I will sub to you in 30 minutes
What's odd is that his eyes look completely emotionless and that he looks like a dead person
He's naturally creepy this is so cool
He smiles like the joker.
I just really, really want to know how his audition for the part went.
Some ladies are saying that he's handsome and all. What makes him handsome is his youth, wait until he's 50...then that's when he will really look frightening.
Demonic??!? Looks more like a sex offender smile
That smile.. 😂 omg! I love him.
Am I only one who thinks it's really when he does that face. Lol.
Question to fellow youtubers. Would anyone like to see him as The Joker?
NOT AGAIN!!! omg I lost it XDDD
dude he's so hot
Wierd that he looks like my left nut
he can play cat in the hat
Bill looks like the kind of guy that would say  my father will hear about this!
Back off girls, I found him before you!!!
He would be a badass joker
I always have to watch interviews with horror film killers to give myself closure that these are actually nice people, and not maniacs who want to kill me😂 Love ya Bill❤️😂😅
i can do the same smile he did
The clown was horrific!  Best not to take kids under 16 to this movie
Is it weird that I can make that smile too? 😐
The actor from the 90's was scary without doing anything, he was just naturally creepy!.
Just saw the movie oh my gosh
i cant look at him without seeing pennywise
Thats a fucked up smile.clowns have been complaining cos this film has been affecting their livelihoods but its jard to take them seriously because..well..their ..clownd.thats actually true its affected there income.
He is just so damn hot!!!!!!
He seems like a cool guy. I'm going to see It tomorrow. Can't wait!
HE IS SO HOT
Awesome interview! Amazing what he can do with his face to create the character.
He looks like a less masculine Tim Curry
He looks creepier without the makeup
teenager
Hes swedish
This smile is 😝
https://www.gearbubble.com/live_once
lol hello satan
Next joker
Aw. The 4chan nerds are smitten.
Kinda reminds me of Jim Brewer.
He reminds me of Dane Dehaan
0:52
you'll Float too.....
I find him oddly attractive
that's amazing
Kinda looks like Kevin bacon
such a cool dude!!!
HOW DOES HE PLAY PENNYWISE (hes hawt af..) xD
not more demonic than Nicholson
The most handsome clown😈❤
HOLLYWOOD BULLSHIT CRAP.
Scared
The Joker
Damn pennywise is hot
Fook this guy.  Long live Tim curry.
Svensk nån?
Aayy
As a scary movie the movie suckeeedd but it was okay as a comedy
My smile gets all the ladies to the sewer
Ya.....\n\n\n\n\nI can see why he was penny wise now... Creepy ass smile 😳
Sub to my channel reply done then I'll sub back

Give me likes
Younger Steve Buscemi😂
Hotty
HELLO FRIENDS!! i dove back into the sea of ~wish~ once more to see what all this free stuff was about... are there any other strange websites you would like me to try?
Who's buying a medium orange?! HAHAHAHA
You should definitely shop on shophush.com and make a haul and first impression
They do this free thing on eBay and ali express as well, sort of. They list items like an eyeshadow palette for $1 but then when you choose the item, the palette goes up to like $15 or so and there's a terrible make up brush, or hair tie, or sponge that is $1. Its all clickbait and it sucks. But pay cheap get cheap.
The return of the intro song!
2 free things and 3 LIES
When you realize every comment here has more than100 likes
The free item means that the price is in shipping order...
I find with Wish if you look at the 'free' items and postage it's the same price as the normals ones. The postage appears to be part of the price. if it says it's free then the postage will be like £5 if it's £3 for the item the postage is usually £2. same price you pay in the end.
I had a commercial from wish in this video 😂
So when the stars are blue that means they are rating the store, the yellow stars are for the product rating
Now i feel like i have to go right now and buy things on wish
She's got really nice content. It's nice to see this instead of the bullshit everyone puts out.
When you get a wish ad before thae video lmao
You should do a verified Wish haul!!
Wearing DIY clothes for a week
Complain about the item, they will refund it. 🤗🤗🤗\nAlso if it's free sometimes it's $3 shipping, but related items. & other stores may have ot cheaper.
For anyone who wanted the sparkly case they sell them in pink and blue at top shop x
You're beautiful without the burka.
Simply go to google and type: *gamesecrx guide* You'll get the only free secret tool fully FREE for this game.
I wish I could see an average person go through like a vanity fair type of makeover, like not just hair and makeup but skincare and facials and all that jazz for the celebrity effect. Has no relevance to this video, I'm just hoping Saf will see it lol
OMG SAFIYA I HAVE THE SAME SHIRT AS YOU IN 7:46 ITS A SHIRT WITH A CAT, UNDER THE CAT IS A POCKET, WHEN YOU OPEN THE POCKET, THE CAT IS HOLDING MIDDLE FINGERS XD
Next: buying first 5 things off the dark web..Things might get dark.
I love these videos!
Was I the only one who.got a Whish advert before the video?
Do a video of buying 5 verified things on wish
Get a phone on wish
part 2 of free things plz
ITS NOT FREE!!! They increase the price for shipping. well that is the case for New Zealand
BUY A WEDDING DRESS FROM WISH!!!!!!!! lol
I love your Mesh top! I've been meaning to get one. Where's your from x
The ad before this video was for Wish 😂
That place is shady as fuck. I won't go near it.
Got a wish ad
They are not free, the shipping price is higher, so you actually pay exactly the same. before they sold 'free' things you just paid the same.
The shipping price is the item price with the shipping cost included. They're allowed to ship things extremely low to us for some reason. Nonetheless, still a good bargain though 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
Got a wish ad
my phone case is from the same brand
When you wish upon a \n\n\n\n\n\nApp
My chains hang low\nMe: *stares out in horror as my head gets filled with do your chains hang low....*
I'm glad that you kind of roasted Wish at the end. If any other online store did that kind of thing everyone would be telling everyone not to shop there lol. Plus all of the stuff they sell is what ends up in landfills because it's literal garbage and there's just so much of it. Anyway, that was my little Wish tangent haha.
I WISH THIS HORRIBLE VIDEO DIDN'T EXIST!
H💿L💿SEXUALS WHERE YOU AT?
You should do the boyfriend buy your clothes!!  ❤️❤️❤️
Can you do a video of first 5 verified wish things???
That liquid is acidic. Do not use that case!!!! There was a huge news story on that!
I love how she's still using that intro song.😂
The way she reads it 😂
Watch the double negatives
Oh my god, so excited to hear Safiya's new intro song!!
does anyone know where the see through mesh black top saf wore is from ????
Girl you should do a wish shoe haul!! Plz!
You should buy a wish wedding dress and bridesmaid dress.
Got a wish ad
The 1st one same tho one time I saw this thing on Amazon and it was called Imuzy Stylish Lovely Pet Dog Stuffed Bed Cozy Soft Fruit Banana Shaped Bed House Kennel Doggy Warm Cushion soooooooo yeah
owners buy the products on taobao in a really really low price then sell it on wish with a profit......
idk why people don't understand this but they put the cost of the item into the shipping. ebay, wish and aliexpress do this.
7:46 she got that black shirt with the cat in the pocket on Wish I'm sure. LOL I see those everywhere and that mesh top 11:30 is also on Wish
Do the first 5 wish verified things
I have to the same watch, only in silver. I love the watch and wear it all the time!
Buying the first things you see in Spotify ads
I have laughed so much 😂😂😂
You should do this next with Pinterest. I see ads pop up all the time to purchase products whenever I'm browsing through the app.
My prices changed once AFTER the purchase. When they emailed the Receipt.  I cancelled/returned everything immediately from that store. That specific store did try and rip me off.
I am dumber for watching this, but you are cute. Thank you.
DO beauty supplies on wish
I love how she is still using her new intro song 😂
I love it hows sofias subscribers l is eating up buzzfeed 💋
They mean the item is free.. You still have to pay for shipping, but it is kinda stupid because it may be free but if it's shipping is $4 than a item that costs $1 and shipping is $2 it would cost less than the free item.
You should test out Wish makeup! I've always wondered about the brushes and palettes.
With wish they have Store ratings and Product ratings. I noticed if you see blue stars it's store ratings and gold/yellow stars is the ratings for the product. That's also why some products repeat them selves and the prices varies because there are multiple stores selling them. I don't know if this is true but It just seems so since I browse the app so many times xD
Aye Can I Get People To Follow My Instagram @ayejoselyn, I Follow Back 🤘

Woooow ur 22 on trending!!!!
i hate ur voice.
Y do they lay bubby on her tummy. Haven't they heard of SIDS .....freaks me out everytime i see it.
Um. Wondering if she should be in bigger bed. Her little head seems cramped in there for fresh air. And breathing in general. Just a thought.
in most families the mother does all of this whilst the father goes to work...... you get the pleasure of being at home with your children more than most......
Why do they put Alessia to sleep on her stomach? I learnt that you weren't suppose to do that because the baby can smother itself to death and not be strong enough to turn itself over?
Just wondering but shouldn't Allessia sleep on her back not on her front as that can be dangerous to babies. She is gorgeous though and I love watching the videos
alessia looks so much like her cousins
Yes that has happened to my grandma! My grandpa had the keys in his pocket as they were saying goodbye and she drove away while the keys were still in his pocket! She drove all the way to the store but couldn't start the car to get home! It was hilarious
I love this family from the bottom of my heart !
Jonathan you do an awesome job vlogging every day and make the vlogs funnier as you can get them!!!!...I reallly appreciate you for letting us come into your home!!!....Thank You Guys!!!!!!
Can't wait for the bingo runs lol 😂
Jonathan the car won't start if the key isn't in it - like somewhere in the car
go to mummy and flick her ear!!...... goes to mum and hugs her! GAWD EDUARDO IS SO CUTE <3
Jonathan knows the lyrics to California Love better than I do. And I live in California and love Tupac. Lol. Go Jonathan
Anyone know when they are coming to Ireland for a meet up x
Eduardo is a crazy lil kid haha throwing the blanket he was sitting on a minute ago
Completely agreed with what you were saying at the beginning Anna! LOVE vlogging and having things like my 21st birthday on YT so I can watch them back in the future!! 💕
Hi Jonathan, the key thing happened to me😩 I left the keys in house and drove the car 10 miles away and then when I tried to restart the car that's when I realised and my partner had to drive with my keys to give me power. It's a thing, it happens.. to many times for me unfortunately 😂
Jonathan!!! I wondered if you and Anna had seen this. I thought after you telling us about your very busy days this would make you both giggle....DISCLAIMER dont watch around kids.\nWatch Go the f**k to sleep, read by Samuel L Jackson on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/Udj-o2m39NA
Love ❤️ Peace ☮️ & Happiness 😊
I spy a Marinette doll
Food fixes everything
Alessa smiling is the most precious thing ❤❤
My mam managed to drive my dad's car without the key as she dropped him off at work and he forgot to give her the key. Luckily she remembered before switching off the engine so she managed to get back to him to collect the key!
Totally can relate. I have. 6 /4/2 and a 8mths old Between drop off pick ups in between errand after school clubs. I sometimes feel like a robot with the same schedule and no human time
i love you guys and your  banter
How do I make your channel not pop up.
Wouldn´t it be easier, if Anna stayed in the house on the morning school-runs and take care of the things that need to be done and than later on pick the kids from school and try to help Jonathan save some time to get his stuff done? That is no hate or anything at all, i´m just wondering, why they don´t handle it that way. Love the Saccone Jolys :)
Jonathan wait till they start joining more after school activities
cute photo of the kids. You guys make beautiful babies
this is the cutest thing <33\n\ncan you please make a christmas calender this year too? i loved the one last year, it really made it easier to wait for christmas <3
The kids are so cute!
Jonathan: what is missing ? Eduardo: food 😂😂
A lovely video I really enjoyed watching it :):) :):) Emilia, Eduardo and alessia are so cute Emilia was so adorable when she said  we have to run after Eduardo and when she got some mints out to eat 😀🐶❤️ Eduardo was so sweet when he said look grandma a lol doll and alessia looked so cute when she was smiling and looking at the camera :):) :):) \n\nAnna what you could do is give alessia a dummy for comfort x \n\nI can't wait for the calendar to come out x
You shouldn't let Eduardo hit you like that. Even if it's playing it's not the best idea to teach him that it's ok to play that rough. That's just my opinion as a case manager who works with kids. I have to teach sooooo many parents to stop playing that rough with kids because they do it at school since they don't understand the difference between playing at home and at school.
the urge to have kids when i watch your videos jonathan....
that happened to my nana my granda opened the car and she drove away them when she turn the engine of she notice she didn't have the key 💗😂xxxxxx
Eduardo taking after his dad Good Morning my Friendliest Friend PRICELESS!!!
imagine if they gave Emilia the SacconeJoly yt account- Eduardo Anna’s and Alessia jonathan’s JSKDKSKSK
If you drive without the keys the car starts beeping and having a breakdown! You can only drive a certain distance away from the keys as well
😂😂😂😂 seems you should have brought some food to keep Eduardo occupied! Laughed so much when he said there was food missing from the picnic! That boy loves his food!
I accidentally drove my keyless car to the supermarket. I could open the door and start the engine because the car was in such close proximity to the keys sitting on the side inside the house, and (from my experience) the car allows you drive as long as the whole time your engine is running, but the second you turn the engine off you can't restart it! I had to be rescued from the car park by my Dad with the keys haha. I wouldn't try it!
My husband always has his car keys in his pocket when we're in the car, even if I'm driving. If I'm dropping him off somewhere he often gets out of the car with the keys & I get an ignition error message on the dash & can't go anywhere! 🙄
That´s what I´m really scared of having kids, they say its amazing having kids but all of those people saying that also say they have no time for them, and I´m kind of a loner I love to step time by myself and having my own space, I am not sure if people like me were meant o have kids. I know I will regret it if I have kids at the moment, but I know I will regret it in a few years (when I´m done with myself haha) if I don´t. That´s stress for me right now!
Anna you look unreal! Alessia is the cutest 😍
Why don't you have Anna pick up Eduardo with Alessia. That way you have a bigger chunk of time to do work with no distractions.
Can't wait to get my hands on the calendar! x
Eduardo singing to Alessia is just precious 💕💕 and a happy belated birthday to Emilia 😊😘
Love Eduardo's response to his Dad. Jonathan says What's missing to our picnic ?  Eduardo says  Food. Such a typical lovely boy.  :)
Why do you bathe Alessia every day? Her skin is going to get so dried out!
Wait. I'm sorry - Eduardo singing Good Morning Again... to Alessia JUST MADE MY OVARIES SKIP A BEAT whyyyy are your kiddos so flipping adorable 😭😭😭
I would have if I was Jonathon if I had to go through all these hurtful and bitter comments on here. Some of you people are so judgemental and nasty.
The car wont start without the keys in the car Jonathan (:
This has been my favourite vlog in a long long time. It was real and sincere there was no trying it was just a good old fashioned vlog
AHH THEY HAVE MIRACULOUS DOLLS! I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEW SEASON 🐞
Im looking foreward to seeing the new calendar x
So glad to be Eduardo's fabulous friend haha
Oh. My. Good. Lord! How fricken cute was Eduardo singing 'good morning my little friendliest friend' when he was waking Alessia up! That boy is way WAY too cute! Xxxxx
Guys for the tour tickets does each adult an kid need one? It says under 14s must be accompanied does this mean i need to buy ticket for child?
My mum once forgot her keys Jonathan! She got stuck when she parked and the car turned off haha my dad had to pick her up
eduardo and his dad have got such a good father son relationship 😊
Eduardo is me with the picnic!! You can’t promise me a picnic and not take food 😂
What's the lipstick you put on in the beginning of this video? I like it very much!Thank you ..
Jonathan: What's missing?\nEduardo: Food.\n\nLITTLE BOY KNOWS WHAT'S UP 👏😂😂😂
@sacconejolys when are you moving house?!?
When the key gets to far the car wont run, my dad will drive and sometimes drop my mom off places and the keys are still in her purse so he cant drive away
Going on the bingo run 😂😂
Can not wait for the 2018 calendar my mom and I have gotten one for each of us both past years  💗 now we get one with Alessia 💗
I have driven my car without having my keys. My husband started my car to warm up a bit (winter time) and he didn't leave the keys in the car. Then once I arrived at my destination I realized I didn't have my key to lock the doors. So he had to drive to me with my keys 😳🙄🤣😂
The cutest part is Eduardo sing the catch phrase to wake alessia! Love it so much
Careful with the mints! 😂 My little cousin ended up with one up his nose when he was little, and he tried to pick it out but it pushed it up further... and you can imagine how painful a mint right up in your nose is! 😳 Had to go to the ER and get it taken out, but of course it had started to dissolve. Ouch!
Hang in there Mate! we all make it.
Tell you what I would listen to the McCain advert over that now tv man any day 😂😂😂
Whats missing? Food. \nThis is the best thing I've heard today.
What would Anna do if you had a 40 hour week 🎀job?
Some people need to take a chill pill. Anna and Jonathan have their own way of parenting and raising their children. Stop telling them what they should or shouldn't do. Also, stop being rude to Anna. Anna is an amazing mother and she doesn't deserve any of these mean comments. That's my rant for the night. Bye!
Alessia is growing so fast.think it's time she went into a cot as she's to big for the Moses basket...wow Emilia 5already ,I swear it was yesterday she was born lol.little Eduardo has come into his own and quite a handsome little boy xx
Whats missing...FOOD..jonathan!!its supposed to be a teddy bear picnic...too cute..eduardo bless you boy 😘😘😘
Super sweet hearing Eduardo singing good morning again to Alessia.
alessias wee face in the camera when anna was opening the stair gate melted my heart!
Have they moved?
Eduardo waking alessia 😍😍😍
Love this 😘
So jonathan does everything wake the kids up,get them their breakfast,get them dressed,take them to school,pick them up from school,play with them,sort their dinner,bath the children,get them ready for bed,edit videos and sort the dogs out but meanwhile on the other hand all Anna does is breast feed alessia.She needs to help Jonathan because at the moment he's doing everything on his own.
Omg Anna looks so pretty ❤️💜🌸
Loved  Jonathan  singing Tupac 😂
eduardo singing to alessia was soooooooo cute.... aaaawww... my heart is melting
SORRY,, YOUR BEAUTIFUL FAMILY!!!!!!!!!!!
Alessia's eyes 💜
Fooood. That was so cute Eduardo
Anna you should join tbh!!
Eduardo hitting Jonathan and Jonathan screaming 😂😂😂😂
Alessia at 1:34 😍😂
Eduardo singing the friendliest friend song to Alessia SOOOO CUTEEEE
OMG Eduardo singing Friendliest Friend just gorgeous <3
Eduardo waking up Alessia was so cute xx
Awwww, that picture of Anna & Alessia was so cute!! Loved the thumbnail too!! (: The picture at the end of the blog is super cute too. (:
Are you seriously moaning about how busy you are Jonathan? You work at home you have nothing to complain about please stop and get a real job
Awww like when Emilia used to call herself Biba lol that was the cutest!!!
Eduardo waking up Alessia is soooooo cute. You are an awesome big brother/entertainer Eduardo. Good job.

Nice to see the whole gang at one place.
APPLE is lost without Steve Jobs, seriously. If he saw that iPhone X, he would have fired all those involved with making it
I can't believe you live your life off of a LeapFrog tablet
everythingapplepro should be there instead of her she sucks
next year I wanna see you on stage!
Huhhh what happened about the face I'd failed
what is the song that plays in the end?
The only reason why I just subscribe to u today is bc of your positive attitude and I like that.
New things all all ways coming a long just like the car replace the horse but not in all parts of the world and one person\nhad a  solid commit on the new phone and  hit's high-tech security system all the police need to do is hold it up to your face\nto unlock it. now this could be a good thing if he thanks you have photos of a missing child but what it has tex of how you\nbringing bibles across a state line.  \n\ncraze ideal right who would stop any one from carrying bibles right hay could a craze person using the phone face ID\nto unlock it and find out were his ex wife or ex-girl friend GPS location is ?\n\nNew Ideals and things come all the time in the old days when bad storms came in and knock out the power many times phones still work but with the cost of cell service at or better that home phones it seems the home phones are going the way of the horse.\n\nNew phones are nice but with the face unlock feature it could be ease for some one to kill , knock you out or tase  you and gain access to your phone  in the name of the law or worse.\n\nSome say new is all ways better but is it.\n \nJust a note to thank on.\nHope you had a good time looks like fun

Justine and an iPhone x the two most beautiful things in the world!
Am I the only one who still hates this kind of blogging? So much filler
BUY THE WHOLE STORE GIRL
Think you need to settle down when describing a boring event. If you want some real excitement let me know ;)
What a freak , she was like the last one there lol
No the X does not look good with that notch that cuts out part of the top screen and part of screen when you watch movies and videos, photos ect. - Who wants a black bar on the left side of the screen covering part of the image when you watch a video or movie? No thx, I ordered the 8 plus :) Im sure we will see a lot of complaints about the notch later on when people who bought the X realise how annoying it is when watching videos. ;-)
I'm still so happy that you got to attend your first Apple keynote! I hope they keep inviting you back. Also, I lowkey ship you and Jonathan. Sorry. 😂🙃
This looks like the movie The Circle
Dam apple !! That building looks like from outer space
I love you videos!!! But I have to say this,  white people! 😂🙈🤷🏻‍♂️
If i'm gonna drop 1g on the X it better make me shit gold
No thanks. I'll stick to my flip phone
Stranger Things at the beginning?
I wonder how big of a tax cut Apple got to build their campus. And how many children in the Bay could have benefited from the money that could've gone to public programs that they and their families take advantage of... with that said I'm excited to get the new iPhone! #capitalism
That was one of the best look at the theater that I've seen. Most people concentrated on the phone (which I can get from the keynote) but your tour really was fantastic and let me see all that I wanted to see.
Finally the same ishit is now different.. instead of same aluminum shit.. well i am impressed
All those pixels and no thumbprint scanner ? Why u do dis Apple .
U see that hating chick at 3:44 🤣
What the different between iPhone 7 and 8
This spoiled little girl needs to talk bout more important things than. iPhones
This is next level Apple fan girl love.
I love you beb
She's so beautiful
Your pretty but...I'm 19, new to youtube.. Check my music y'all :)
That part at the top is really annoying
I know that boy
Who just clicked on the vid cuz it was on Trendings 😂😂😂
You look so excited.. 😁.. Live it up \nhttps://youtu.be/LZOJPrxSl8c
Can someone tell me the name of the song
The model looks ugly. The actual phone looks great.
Is this how the future will be like???
*breaths in* \n\nWelp apple is a rip off and iphone X is old technology for 5x the price...\n\n*breaths out*
Wow only $1,000?? OBVI we all have that kind of money to drop on a CELLPHONE.
1:30 Ijustine: I don't have any friends rn.\n\nme:I know how you feel I have no friends either.
Great video, iPhone X is so beautiful
Is the silver more white and the space gray more black ? Wish I could see it in person so I could decide which one to get
Love your enthusiasm. Thanks for sharing your experience.
If Steve was still alive he wouldn't have let this dumb shit happen
Awesome video Justine, thanks for sharing the experience 😀
i love how everyone knows justines' obsession for apple 😝
You have not changed at all still look pretty as you were 10 years ago
I pre-ordered a new Apple Watch I hope I will get it early like were those people that pre-ordered
who got a samsung ad on this video... lol
I completely forgot about iJustine! I remember when the first iPhone came out and the video of the ridiculous itemized AT&T bill. I used to shake my head at my iphone bills too. Anyway, iJustine, you're aging well, glad to see you're still around.
9.48 is that her bodyguard lol
When you regret buying the iphone x
Let's see some topless pictures with the new phone
She's so happy
The iPhone X more like IPhone Xpensive
I will still love to get the first iphone.
Apple should have a band that lights up!😺
Still drop dead gorgeous, you haven't aged a day in 10 years. Love all your content Justine ❤️
Wow, Apple finally decided to make a Samsung galaxy phone. Good times
Only thing i cant believe is how are we going to go to 7 to 8 to 10 where is 9 did they run out of ideas and threw a x at the end to make it more buyable
Apple is operated\n\n\n\n\nCome at me apple fanboys
Grossly overpriced. If people only knew how much it cost the company to make these phones in China, they wouldn't buy them. The really bad part is, many lower income people will be running out to buy these phones with money they either don't have(on credit) or with money they should be using for much more important things. People will go into debt just to have an iPhone. The obsession with iPhones is at unprecedented levels.
ijustin sucks DIIIICK
mkbhd be all like THIS IS NEW!?!?!?! EVERYTHINGS NEW!?!?!?!? no it isnt you sheep its the same damn phone as before sept different little tweaks apples just copying and pasting
What's the deal with being obsessed over a phone?
Why is this trending this is just another white girl obsesed with every piece of technology this shit youtube trending page
Dear Friends..\n\nOne day soon for all of us all of these distractions will not matter. There is a real battle for souls right now going on and millions upon billions are being lured away by satanic forces, spending all of their time, money and energy on everything except God.\n\nThere is a real place called heaven, and one called hell.   Hell is said to be eternal torment and separation from God, where there is no more hope ever.  Likely a most horrid place you wouldn't want any one to go for 5 minutes let alone trillions upon trillions of years...forever.  \n\nSee here; \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5gv-V9axtg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLOAUB9Vjo0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vywj182oFw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDsn5v4pdgY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmp3UNjeu0k\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15k-1V2gx6I\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2G6yFeWmw8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYAVkuNk8pU\n\nHave you ever stopped to really think about how little time you may have left on this planet?  I mean really let it sink in and think about it.  What are you spending your short amount of time on? Friend..Do you know absolutely sure 100% if you died today where you would go?  Jesus said what would it profit you if you gained everything in this entire world, but you lost your own soul...in hell FOREVER.  Jesus asked what would you give in exchange for your own soul?\n\nFortunately God desires all to come be with him forever and it is an awesome place beyond description forever and ever...\nTo make this possible Jesus came to pay for our punishment our sin, our destination without God, and to bring us home to the most awesome, loving inconceivable place for all eternity. But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.\n\nAlso all of us have done wrong things and broken laws that God gave us.  Don't worry you don't get to heaven by being a good person.  And there aren't many different paths to heaven.  Fortunately there is a way that everyone who has done bad things can change and go to heaven forever and ever.  God said there is only one way to heaven..not many paths and fortunately we don't get there by being a good person\n\nIn John 14:6 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. Nobody goes to heaven without Jesus.  Plain and simple that is how we go to heaven.  Not by being good, or following many different paths...it comes down to Jesus and Jesus alone.  What is required?  Well we learn that what is required is to repent of our wrong doings, and believe on the Jesus, and endure to the end of our lives continuing in our faith in Jesus.\n\nIt all comes down to this...will you Believe on and Trust Jesus today.  Change your eternal destiny right now be laying your trust in the only thing that can save us and fill the void in our hearts. Jesus Christ.\n\nWill you trust on him Before its too late!\n\nYou will all meet him VERY Soon whether in this life or the soon coming afterlife!\n\nWill you put your trust in him right now friend?\n\nPlease let this settle in deeply.  When you draw your last breath that God gives you, which could happen any moment.  In that moment you draw your last breath...the only thing that will matter is What YOU did with Jesus in this life....nothing else at all in that moment will matter..nothing else (everything but that is temporary and fading).  What you did with Jesus in this life will be the ONLY thing left that will matter in the moment you draw your final breath.  You cannot at this time begin to conceive just how important this message is.  I pray that you will take heed to it while their is still a short time for you to do so, and it is everlastingly too late for you.  Please friends do not ignore or delay in this serious message about turning to Jesus right now, and truly following him the rest of your days. \n\nHas anyone ever told you that: GOD LOVES YOU & has a wonderful plan for your life?\nI have a real quick but important question to ask you... If you died tonight, would you go to heaven?\n\nMuch Love to You\n\n(If you found value in this message please share this crucial message of hope with as many people as possible).\n\nhttp://howtofollowjesus.net\nhttp://embarktoheaven.info
apple is a joke. i don't understand how people still buy this crap.
who cares is just a phone, retards
I cant believe how expensive this collection is,i mean its nice but nothing life changing
The prices are rediculous
I feel bad thinking this but I really wonder how you would've felt about these products had you not known they were vb?\nI've watched this channel for years and I respect you both a ton and such is the reason why I don't want to doubt you.
Will the real techniques powder bleu brushes come to ulta?
That lip liner color looks fucking good on you.
Dolce & Gabanna, please. Those are only available online and I'd like to see them tried out before I go and purchase them. Thank you!
You're so adorable!!! I love your makeup tutorials!!
please do a few looks with Natasha denona Lila palette! if you and your sister each did a look together from one palette, it would be like two looks in one video! genius! esp since you're both so talented and not just for ND but any brand and palette, that would be a cool video to see from you two
I really enjoy your videos....Could you review makeup revolution... thanks
Shit shit shit I really am trying to curb my spending on makeup. This doesn't help.
I recently bought some makeup from W7, I'd love to see you do a review of them! It's insanely affordable. Their Glowcomotion highlighter/eyeshadow is gorgeous. I also got their matte eyeshadow palette and all the shades are very wearable.
I would like to see the normal Estée Lauder range, especially the Double Wear Foundations and their differences!
Lovely video. Super informative and honest opinions. Look forward to more of this style of video. X
There's not a product that you used that doesn't look wonderful & flattering on you! I was wondering though, what color/brand did you use on your hair? I really like it
As much as I like Estée Lauder products I just can't get on board with this it's like taking out a bank loan to buy a bronzer, products look gorgeous on you though nic!
When is the defining crease brush out? Only shade set in the brushes info ☹️
Baby hairs- put hairspray on a toothbrush and comb through! :)
Will you please do an Avon makeup review! Thank you :)
Hello can you feature hourglass & Laura mercier. I love watching your videos ☺️
Stunning as always but the makeup looked a bit doll like for me...maybe it was the skin. I know a lot of people love the perfect look but I love to see your amazing skin a little more natural xx
I know it not fashionable but I would love to see a MAC review from their permanent line. You usually only see the LE collections.
I can still hear this creeking/grinding noise in the videos! What is this???
Is VB the only one who can afford this stuff??
No way I would pay rip off prices for VB makeup.
I loved this look and the products seem very beautiful, I just wonder why did You put the foil on before the crease color? (not shade, just curious if this order matters)
I have the bronzer and it's so good! I'm vey fair and it's hard to find a good not too dark not too warm bronzer. Plus the packaging is so great, like really. \n\nI'm curious how the powder compares to the hourglass ambient powder?
Beautiful makeup 😊 you look stunning lovely 💖 I'd love to see a review on the Danessa Myricks range please xx
Would love to see a Nyx brand tutorial. :) thanks :)
Make a video with FentyBeauty!!
I would love a MUA review. \nAlso great video :)
Yess . Would love to see huda beauty next 😍😍
Please do an all look on Bobbi Brown, no one ever does that. And I love certain things I've tried but it's been quite a while since I've punched anything. I really loved her skin care as well and would love to see if it's all as good as I remember! ❣️❤️
VB obviously doesn't live in the real world her makeup range is way too expensive
Are you still using Lilash? Looking lovely x
The make-up look is so beautiful..
without makeup or with. you look flawless. you are stunning.
Love you and Sam with darker hair! Both so beautiful! ❤️❤️❤️
Please do a Bobbi Brown one!
I'm enjoying cream blusher a lot more now that I'm maturing a bit.
I'd like to see Jouer!
Tooth brush and spray it with hair spray
I would like to see some older brands which aren't so mainstream but have stood the test of time! Elizabeth Arden, Guerlain, Givenchy! Don't tend so see these products in videos!
To help with the whispy hairs: use hair gel on a toothbrush (of course a new one you only use for this purpose) and whisk them back. Stays in place all day.
How much is the foundation primer (Victoria Beckham) x
The foundation blends perfectly in with your skin tone! It looks gorgeous! <3
Why do you consider yourself lucky to interview VB?She is launching an exceedingly expensive makeup line. It's not as if she had you for tea.
Can you do a review of Anastasia Beverly Hills products ?
You should sell your brushes individually because there are Real Techniques brushes that I want to buy but don't get because they only come in sets that have brushes I'm not interested in. I'm not going to pay for an entire set when I only want one or two brushes. Just a thought!
Review Chanel Makeup. I havent heard a lot from Chanel makeup products on youtube.
Please do a review on fenty beauty...
your skin is sooooooooooooooooo amazing!!! would you make a video telling us your skin care journey, PLEASEEE
Please could you or Sam do a Fenty Beauty video? :-*
Fab, honest review.  Really interesting.  Please don't do CT - I pass that every day on my walk into work.  I've spent enough there recently!!!
You are so pretty ❤️
✨❣️Awesome Review/Demo..👏🏻.. Love the Look You Created with VB..😍.. Would love to See you Review the Denessa Myricks range, She's created some Amazing products that are so versatile for every Skin Tone/Color!!❣️✨
Beautiful look Nic 😍 But the prices are ridiculous. No thanks 😁
Since your a very well known make up artist and interviewed VB I feel it's hard to be subjective. From other reviews I've seen this products are extremely overpriced. The products aren't bad but $60 dollars for a eye shadow quad where the pans are small and has two colors that don't go together at all. But I get it it's VB.
what i didnt know the pencil/kajal difference, thanks for teaching!
VB can do no wrong. Her collection of make up looks stunning. Maybe ideas for Christmas lists for people?
Can you do the new bare minerals barepro liquid foundation??
Estee Lauder have cut back training so much it's mainly on counter training from a little pack, not great x
Thank you for creating this look and video for us, Nic, you've done a simply marvellous job and you look absolutely fabulous (...darling 😉)! Can't wait to see your next one on Huda 😘all the way from Australia
yaay hudabeauty! also do kiko please and tom ford thank you!
I know I can always trust Sam and Nic! They don't lie about products. Thank you girls for being honest <3
Loved the video and I love all the products too, but could really only afford one or two products.... but which ones! Please could you do a Kat Von D review? I have a the foundation and love it, would like to see other products in the range too. Thank you x
Can you do the new Chanel collection.
Try hairspray on a toothbrush to get rid of those little whispy bits! Use a half drop of serum/styling oil on top and it just gives it that high fashion sleek hair look! ❤️
I was hoping this would  be crap. Lol.   It all looks so beautiful.   :). Sheila
Can u do the revolution soph does nails one??
Use a toothbrush with hairspray on to help with the wispy hairs it works really well with your parting when your hair is down too 😀
When you said you couldn't find the pencil, I immediately thought check to see if Edie has it! Lol!!  Did you ever find it?
Bumble and Bumble Sumo Wax for whispy hair. XOXO!
Hate estee lauder. Bad eyeshadow. Hate the lip stick too.
Great video. Dior, please! :D
Laura Mercier, please!
Beautiful makeup
£36 for a mascara is ridiculous. I would never buy that.
Fenty Beauty please?
FENTY!!🤚🏿 who's with me press thumbs up!!!
You are so incredibly beautiful! I can't get over how gorgeous your skin is!!!\n\nAnd I hope you are feeling good, health wise. My prayers r with u.
Wrong celebrity love
Please review it cosmetics 💄
Fendy beauty please
Makeup Geek next please.
Makeup revolution?
Too much
Hourglass!

Bobbi Brown please!
Bobbi Brown please do
Your skin is amazing!
Please do a Fenty Beauty Review like this!! <3
Are we just gonna ignore De Bruyne's pass at the end of the game???
Early days but I think an english team could win it this year. Best bunch of teams we've had in the champions league for quite a lot of years now
They were the easiest goals I have ever seen\nWhat a Feyenoord doing
Man City look like a different class at the moment. They ripped Liverpool apart the other day😪 And destroyed Feynoord today⚽️
Media always pay to much attention to opposition teams playing badly vs City and never give City credit.
Feyenoord got hit with two stones
De bryune is amazing his passing is filth
Feyenoord so bad lol
did anyone notice de bruyne's reaction at 0:31?? hahaha
KDB is absolutely insane! He has something special that no other football players have! He has such vision and control and plays intelligently! He is so accurate! 🤘🏻👑
Second game in a row we've smashed a team that sing YNWA
Gabriel Jesus > Rashford
arsenal will win champions league
I am a man u fan but Mendy was worth the amount city payed 4 him
Best team ever. Come at me haters! 🖕🏿
Kevin d...was that a shot or a pass jks
City might have the cash but can never buy history
And to think Man City were gonna swap aguero for Sanchez aguero the far superior player.
Manchester city look strong this year .
Kun Aguero, their greatest ever European scorer \n\nLast Time I checked Argentina was in South America...
Ok then well done bt

MUST SEE!!! https://youtu.be/ZFAz2QKcOTA
When did feyenord sign Odell Beckham jr
.
Poor Feynoord
*Jesus* ftw
T
Feyenoord did well! Lol
Ayy
Come On guys let's get BT to 400k subscribers
I hope Man City lose their next game
Let's play a game. Which UCL game was Arsenal fans & players watching?
This is what happens when Brad Jones plays in goals...
lol  😂😂😂
Anyone else hear that metal gear solid sound or am i bugging out
KDB better then kroos and modric, kroos and Modric are called the best because they are at real madrid
First one is an own goal. Comes off one leg which is going wide and then the other knocks it back on goal.
City have just smashed arguably the best side in Europe atm 4-0. There's no reason why we can't go on and win it now! #FeyenoordWho?
i'm scared to watch spurs against city this year... city look solid
BT Only said that Feyenoord played bad.\nNever said we were good. City bashers all over
Arab FC.
Title is wrong says 3-0 to feyenoord
Aguero being their greatest scorer in Europe isn't so impressive when the only time they have been to the Champions league is the past 6 years.
0:56\nEuropean? Someone needs a geography lesson...
Hey Lovely people, I'm loving reviewing these sites and experience and sharing the good, the bad and the ugly with you all! I've linked most of the items in the description box for those asking, however they often sell out or are removed on ebay! Hope you enjoy and see you on Sunday for my next video xx
I'd love to see public desire, ego official and asos shoes too. These are my fave videos from you. It's sooooo funny.
Hey! I think you got the shoe sizes mixed up a bit- 40 is a 7 41 is 7 1/2 and 8 is 42 which is why some of them might have been to small? Loved the video xxx
Where did you get your shirt from, its so cute
Simply go to google and simply type: *gamesecrx guide* You'll get the only one 100% working secret fully FREE for this game.
These review videos are my favourite 👍🏻 but I have to say that a 42 is classed as an 8 and a 41 is a 7. So if you asked for an 8 they'll most likely send a 42.\nIt goes like this:\n3-36, 4-37, 5-38, 5.5/6-39, 6.5-40, 7-41 8-42 ☺️
I'd date the f out of you
I have a size 42
I appreciate the HIMYM gif so much
Why I love you that much Patricia 😍 I'm starting my YouTube channel guys and it means a lot to me if you visit it and give me your opinion so I can improve myself , thanks 😍😘
i can watch her all day long
so happy you are the same size as me and not like a 36 like every other girl with millions of shoe choices. I'm a size 42/41. I have a white faux leather pair (no see-through plastic or pattern) of the same shape (other brand) as the second high-heeled shoes you tried on. Looks fab and proportionate on a larger foot
You bout to hit 2 Million this year babe.... keep grinding
Im not about having that beak foot 🤣🤣\n❤️ ya girl
I don't think she'll ever understand how weak her haul videos make me.
She has the same exact voice as Chewing Gum. Has this already been said? Love the accent!
The red shoes actually look good on your feet
Im loving the second ones
You're just so beautiful 😍😭\n(This is my first time seeing one of your videos)
Can you try shoes on wish.com 😀 please
You can use sand paper on the bottom of the slippery shoes and it should give you a better grip on the sole of the shoe. Love your videos!
where did you get the yeezy
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOUR HAIR!!! do a hair video plss I really wanna know how to get a hair like yours
Was is the link to the yezzys shoes
This was honestly SO entertaining and had me and my sis rolling ~ THAT BOW 😹
Love the knee length boots!!!!!!!
This video made me subscribe! I laughed the whole whole video. You are hilarious!
Hey can you please review prettylittlething ? Xx
Patricia.... I can't🤣🤣🤣. You are too hilarious.
I love love love your videos! I always get a good laugh😁Have a great day Patricia!!!
Your so pretty!!  I love you!! You accent is beautiful!
Hello beautiful people me: Am I beautiful?
lmao Patricia's commentary is gold
The knock off Valentino's are not worth it. They couldn't even make all the straps an even/consistent width.
She used a brazilian meme!! ❤❤❤
THESE ARE THE STRUGGLE 😂😂😂😂
You got to do a couple checks to see if the yeezys are real, if you bought them for any less than £400 they're most like not real, if you're okay with that then that's up to you
I dig eBay. only buy if rating is 95% or higher. lot of fakes out there so always read reviews before you buy.
I love how you say adidas lol
Hey Patricia! Where in England are u from?
Girl. Your videos are ev👏er👏y👏thing👏. Keep doin what you're doing!!
I like die when she inserts memes into her videos
I love the original version of the pink bow tennis. Those are just too precious. The copy cats from eBay are really a struggle.
Try the goat app of shoes and do a review
This is going to come off as cringey, so sorry. But you are literally the most gorgeous woman I've ever witnessed. Sorry for being thirsty 😂
There's no way she didn't steal those pink shoes from Grace 😂
It took me forever to realize she was saying adidas lol
Love you're lace front!!!! Where did you get it?
I love the second pair of heels ❤
Please try Everything5pounds.com it's got great stuff there if you look into it we'll x
You are so hot and i love your accent.  Great video too.
Yes. To answer your question.
Loving your hair this way
Any small youtubers wanna support each other
What's the  name of the lippie that you have on?
This hair looks absolutely GORGEOUS on you
This was fun! Tip: Shoe liners keep your toes from sliding to the front of high heeled sandals.
i would love to know the return experiences of ur hauls . i just love watching ur videos
Pat I love this hair style on you!!! Laughed so hard in the first pair and the pink struggle 😂😂😂
sub for a puppy
You're hair is so cute!
Omg your so perfect i love your accent!!!!!!
Where is the link for the Yeezys😩
Dear people. Check out my latest video WASTED! in my channel. The video features an hour length dance remix set personally created by myself to keep people up and raise fund. The set is comprised of 16 pop/trance hybrid tracks, and the set will give you both both chill and blast. Please share and like the video! Thank you for your time and support!\n\np.s. I prefer Amazon because it's quick and more convenient though. But Ebay's good too
Patricia big fan of your and your reviews..........so I know you're married but there's a new trend that came about as a way for brides on a budget, and that's online wedding dress shopping. The dresses are well made (at times) and are at discounted prices because it's mainly from China. Shocked that not a lot of reviews are on youtube for online wedding dresses. With that being said, I know that you're married so with Michael's blessings, can you please review wedding dresses from sites like dressillyme.com, pgmdress.com and tidetell.com ?
Don't mean to be a troll haha, but I just started my YouTube channel and would appreciate if anyone reading this could check it out.
where did you get your top from?? love it!!!!
Isn't a 41 a US 10?
f r e e  f i f t i e s
I don't think the Yeezys are real due to the insole design but you could always do the blacklight test or show viewers the inside of the shoe.

The tears pouring out of my eyes rn😭
This was one of my favourite songs 😁
She sounds and looks so natural moving on the stage 💛
OMG I love this Song and this Version 💙💙
I got a shitty Iphone8 ad before coming here.
I was actually waiting for this moment
Ohh i thought the other see you again
I got my sights set on you\nAnd I'm ready to aim\nI have a heart that will\nNever be tamed\n\nI knew you were something special\nWhen you spoke my name\nNow I can't wait to see you again\n\nI've got a way of knowing\nWhen something is right\nI feel like I must have known you\nIn another life\n'cause I felt this deep connection\nWhen you looked in my eyes\n\nNow I can't wait to see you again\n\n[Chorus:]\nThe last time I freaked out\nI just kept looking down\nI stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking about\nFelt like I couldn't breathe\nYou asked what's wrong with me\nMy best friend Leslie said Oh she's just being Miley\nThe next time we hang out\nI will redeem myself\nMy heart can rest till then (a-whoa a-whoa)\nNow I can't wait to see you again\n\nI got this crazy feeling deep inside\nWhen you called and asked to see me tomorrow night\nI'm not a mind reader but I'm reading the signs\nThat you can't wait to see me again\n\n[Chorus]\n\nI got my sight set on you and I'm ready to aim\n\n[Chorus]\n\n(a-whoa a-whoa)\nNow I can't wait to see you again

I literally had this song stuck in my head yesterday, and then BAM! A cover of it.
I like this as a country song omggg
This is and always will be the best song  of Mileys

La vieja miley de regreso. Esto es emocionante
Sam transforms when she's with Indie. A mother's love ❤
Bad lighting? Girl I would watch you even if you were in a pitch black room and all I could hear was your voice. 🤣
You should get edge control to really get your hair to match, it'll look neater. Why Yana ain't taught you that yet?
Lol Jason doing the crab 🦀 dance 😂
Jason kinda dancing behind you in the background made my day 😂
Natural hair, short hair, long hair, dyed hair, hubby in video or out of video.. who cares all theses yrs of great content 👌🏾keep it up, your a stunner & your family is lush, stay blessed 🙏🏽
okay a lot of you must not pay attention to her videos she's answered so many questions like more than once before... love ya sammi and also just chill about jason we only see a snippet of sam's life
Jason and you are so adorable together 😍❤️ I hope to find somebody who makes me laugh like he does with you Sammy ✨
I cut out coffee from time to time and it helps me with my anxiety. So it most definitely could be a link. Maybe switch to decaf if you need your fix. It does help...do try it lovely xxx
Sam ❤❤❤❤ you're the sweetest we could gush on here for ages 😂 let's make the meet up happen xxx
I can't wait to see the bag!!!!
Aww Sam you're a great mom \nLove your little family
Be careful out there Sammi! I always think of you anytime I hear about the awful events in London, especially in the subways 💜
That salad actually looks and sounds amazing to me!!
Does anybody know where Sammi's pink jumper is from? Not too sure if she mentioned it or not...? xxx
I had the same reaction with coffee, I started drinking it everyday in college and my anxiety was horrible. I thought it was stress from school that was making me feel not like myself but after I stopped caffeine I felt much better. Also it stains teeth and gives you heartburn lol
I would 100% recommend quitting coffee. I had really bad anxiety for years and was advised to give up and now my anxiety is so rare I can't even remember the last time I felt anxious. I know it's  brutal having  a baby with no coffee but I will take exhaustion over anxiety mixed with caffeine and exhaustion any day! hope it helps xxx
Honestly Sammi, I find it all the time that I have a bit more coffee than usual or than I need and bam... my anxiety hits me like a ton of bricks. Just the wrong amount of it builds it up so much for me, so cutting down will hopefully help any anxiety you have!
I gave up reg coffee years ago cuz I got bad anxiety. I drink decaf when I do drink coffee and I like it! Doesn't make me anxious. Also I looooove this tea by celestial it's called TENSION TEA. I'm not sure if they sell it in the UK but if they do it helps loads! It's for headaches but it's so calming. When I'm feeling anxious it calms me down. It's a life saver! I even keep a few in a ziplock bag in my purse in case I'm out and about and I feel anxious.
I think that people would like to see u editing/working/filming etc. because thats motivate us to work and set our goals hahahahah  ❤️  We like see your normal part of the day doing boring stuff and in this way I don't feel depressed for my everyday boring life too hahah
Hmm I think your jumper was upside down 🤔😂
Sammi i lovvvve ur vlogs & ur vibes, and puuuhhhhlllleeease don't get offended/upset but can u pls try a next hairdresser bc Yanna(I think) does not do ur hair well. Please don't be upset, I would advise my own friends the same.  Loving the red lippy tho.
WE MISS JASON!!!! i miss him cooking, and talking , and living. come back!!
nice one with the banana bread :D
well I'm even more of a coffee addict than you and I've noticed that even when I have minimal amounts I still feel very ancious and drained. So I guess it depends
I also think that coffee makes anxiety worse because it releases adrenalin in your body so you're going to feel even more nervous... I'm currently cutting it down also, and drinking green tea instead which makes the transition soooo much easier
Didi anyone else at the beginning of the video hear It's cheeseday? :'D
I just love your vlogs. I don't even mind watching you make a salad. Indie is such a playful & intelligent baby. I love her smile, one can tell that she is loved very much! I can't wait until she starts talking. Thanks Sam for showing us more of your life. Yes, caffeine is very bad for anxiety. I've had years of struggle with anxiety. I also believe that making sure we eat enough and not skip meals is important too. Do they have decaffeinated coffee in England? We have it here in the States & it helps me to drink that. There still is a tiny amount of caffeine in decaffeinated coffee but, it's very low. You look so happy! \nLove,\nDebbie 💋
I need to make that banana bread sounds really good <3  Hope all is well lovely - really enjoy these vids I watch the while my little one naps and they always chill me out :) xx
This was the best vlog so far :D Keep it going girl :*
Just have to say.... ur the only person I watch that is real!! Who doesnt come across as self obsessed like so many others!! Just normal!! So funny and naturally pretty! Definitely my number 1 to watch!! 😘😘😘😘
Hi Samantha, is your Missoma initial necklace the small one? And did you go with the Missoma chain?
... And I thought that I was crazy because coffee makes me feel anxious too 😳
I don't know why but I love seeing you tubers make coffee. I like to see what different kinds of ideas they have. So I love coffee talk!
Jason reminds me so much of Kit Harrington!
i laughed out loud. thanks for sharing your personality with us -- it's really a joy.
Where is that pink chunky sweater that you were wearing in the beginning of this vlog from? The one that people were saying you were wearing inside out..
Coffee defiantly personally does effect my anxiety I'm not a very anxious person or one that has trouble with anxiety regularly but it kind of just comes in waves and coffee kinda helps it come up personally
Jumpers on backwards in the dining room clip 😂
Love your outfit for the dinner! Your hair pulled back looks so nice!
Is that the Skip Hop high chair? Do you recommend it?
I also realized that cofee make me anxious
So cool seeing you as a mom and wife. You make it look easy💕💕
Coffee definitely makes my anxiety worse I cut out all caffeine for a while and it made a massive difference :)
Great video as always. Yours are my favourite to watch. I love Jason's dancing at 5:25 😂
inspired to bake! also love the BTS of you filming. such a pretty makeup look :) \nyou're totally right about how exercise like filming! just gotta do it and you never regret it
Your living room is a dream come true.
Where are your curtains from the pink ones ? 😍😍😍❤️
Where is the rug in your office from? Been looking for one just like that for ages! Xxx
you and barbara should totally do a collab! i've been waiting for a video of you two together for years! ♥
As soon as I watched this I made vegan banana bread haha! Thanks for the suggestion xx
Now I can't wait to see that Maje bag😍
I have a spot on my nose too, I feel your pain 😭😂😘
Can you do a full house tour?
Are you renting or did you buy your house? Love the vlogs as always! xx
Hello beautiful!  Just wanted to say that I absolutely love the table and chairs and my goodness, that solarium area just outside the dining room is absolutely to die for.  How lovely and relaxing it must be to just chill out there if you ever get the chance to as a new mum. 😘
I got the answer to my own question after watching your wedding video. Hannah looked beautiful. But she didn't outshine you. You looked absolutely, stunningly gorgeous.😃
Idk why but this video didn't show up in my subscription queue. Luckily it showed up in recommended because I love your vlogs!
Omg, you rock that red lipstick so beautifully!! ❤️
You looked so gorgeous with your hair pulled back and with the red lipstick <3
Sam: Please excuse my appearance  but she looks gorgeous😩❤️😍😍😍😍
Less coffee more MAGNESIUM. Best thing for anxiety EVERRR
I love this very casual and not so perfect vlog I swear vlogs are my favorite. It's nice to see what life is like in London as Samantha 😊🙌🏼
What an adorable clip with you and Indie playing around!! Hope Jason's good by the way dont see much of him lately. Loving these vlogs though :) xx
Yay another vlog! Thanks for doing this so regularly I can imagine it's not easy (when your not feeling like it and then having to edit) but these are so enjoyable to watch! Love knowing I've got a video to look forward to so regularly ❤️ Do you think you'll do more of the London series?! That was so informative and enjoyable to watch too xx
I totally get what you mean about how filming can be a bit of pick-me-up even when you're not particularly in the mood! Also coffee doesn't mix well with anxiety at all as it can exacerbate it, maybe try decaf options? Loving your September vlogs, much love 😊 x
Hey! Re: coffee intake and anxiety, I know that stimulants interact with the same system in your brain as anxiety does. Seeing as coffee has caffeine (which is a stimulant), that could maybe explain why you've been feeling so socially anxious lately! x
Heyy have I already mentioned how much I love Vlogtember? (Lol I have) your timelapses sound so weird it freaks me out 😂 would you like to try putting music or sth over it?! The coffee thing makes sense, your heart rate speeds up and thus causes the same reaction that you get when you're anxious! I guess that could explain it, it IS true that the body identifies a feeling with something, so whenever I get anxious (not socially but about everything in general) I start feeling hot; but when I get really hot out of the blue I immediately start getting panicky because I just got the same feeling that comes with my anxiety! Coffee doesn't affect me personally, but I wish it did because at least you get to cut down on that whereas i can't cut down on stressful situations :( kisses to you and your family, AS ALWAYS, I love you all x
the face indie did wenn she found you behind the sofa 😍
I am always really loving your videos. It's as if ur my friend or something and you give positive energy. Love that! And btw, the house is looking awesome!
Am I the only one who thinks Jason sounds and looks slightly like Jon Snow King in the North? Also he would make a good actor in GOT...
Hey Sam I became a Barista about two years ago and started drink loads of coffee and with time noticed how it changed my mood so much started giving me anxiety and mind you your personality is just like mine so bubbly, fun, always smiling and after drinking so much coffee I noticed I always felt so down. So I cut down a lot I'll have one once a week and I feel so normal again it's hard to explain but definitely try it. And I know at times I'm like what is life without coffee lol but you'll be find love you Sam!!!
Barbaraaa 💘
Wow! You look so damn pretty with your hair tied 😍😍
How do you cook with nice clothes on? I would get 10 stains by just walking in the kitchen.
btw i started watching the handmaid's tale on your recommendation and omg it was so good!! haven't been that into a series in quite a while. thank you!!
Loved this vlog and loved seeing the family together, it's a shame people keeping being so rude to Jason in the comments. Let the man live people
Lovely table!
<3
i love love loveeee your tattooed arm !!! it looks so freaking cool , cool mummy
❤️❤️❤️
Vegan, yes!
Peppa!
Jason reminds me of Kit Harrington lol.
YOUR BABY IS SOCUTE ❤️
Love watching Indie.. she is adorable😘
I miss Jason in the vlogs! Came back to us Jason :P
Jason has to be the worst youtube husband ever. Doesn't seem supportive at all. A smile would suffice? These vlogs are part of Sammi's livelihood and unfortunately for Jason he is going to be filmed sometimes.
Jason having a moan about Sam's mum being late 🙄🙄🙄 Here's an idea - look after your own kid you slack shit, since you do nothing all day???!
I know you're probably super busy already but if you could put links to outfits in vlogs i would love you forever! i need me that blush jumper in the beginning girl! Aside from that thanks for always being entertaining.. your family makes my heart happy <3 x
Just love your fenty make up it looks so glowy and natural love you!!
You always look so amazing!
Why does Jason act dickish in the vlogs?
Is her fenty beauty vid up yet xx
I love the dining room/ office area. So amazing. That table is beautiful
i wish jason would talk more on the vlogs :( why not make it a family vlog channel?
Jason !!!! Thank you so much for saying hi to us. Do you know we all missed your chats in Sam's video.  Good to hear and see your dancing behind the scene. Sam nothing is boring...daily videos are my fav and i enjoy very much...heee..yea cant wait to see the make up video and the items you bought. Falling in love with Indie everytime we watch her growing....she is the center of attraction. Will love a home tour video when you are ready....😊
Always love seeing Jason! And I've been wanting to make banana bread for ages!!! Think I'm gonna do it tomorrow...
Jason 😍 Loving vlogtember Sammi 😘
16oz rib eye steak>banana bread
I love his smile :)
Can't wait to see him in Montreal.... montreal gang where your you at ?????
Hi Nile, I did gymnastics when I was younger but i was never flexible enough to advance to a higher level. It got to the point where my coach told my parents that they would have better luck spending their money elsewhere. I really loved it especially bars, because I am naturally strong and they were fun for me. I am now 17 and haven't done gymnastics for six years. Do you think it is possible for me to get back into it? Or do you think it's too late?
Why tf is this guy always trending?
Hey do you twist both ways in training or competitions? Im really only able to twist one way, kind of frustrating id like to see your take on it
U even a champion?
Any small youtubers wanna support each other
I do gymnastics and you and the British team are such an inspiration to me
Nile , is there any way you could make a video giving advice to gymnasts like me who are finding it hard to resist quitting gymnastics and can't find much of a reason to stay in the sport :// I love the sport and couldn't imagine my life without it but I don't know wether to quit
i train at this training centre it's so cool knowing that you go there too!!💗🤸🏼‍♀️🤸🏼‍♀️
I'm in love with the new editing
It is great to see that you are well Nile and training hard for the competition, I'm sure this effort will be rewarded. Hugs man
Why is it every video is on trending but you haven't got at least 1M subscribers?
i love this style of editing, good job! @00:54
I really want to do gymnastics but I have never done it before. I'm nearly 18 and feel like I won't be good enough to start gymnastics now. I'm not in the best of shape either. I know they do adult gymnastics by me at lillenshall but I feel like I won't be good enough or fit enough. Do yo have any advice or should I think Of something else to do.
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
sorry thumbs down cuz clickbait\nand not going through with it
Anyone else just on here to look at fit men in shorts 😂
I bet these guys fap in front of each other and still claim to be straight.
Every video this guy uploads goes on trending page
Are you all picking on our Scottish commonwealth champion there? Just as well my mum doesn't watch you tube! She loves both Daniels!!
We LOVE you here in Atlanta, Nile. You're infectiously chiper and lovable. congrats on the champiionship and good luck in Canada.
loved this vid mate!! Keep up the good grind boy 😎💖💯
Wilson is literally the best gymnastics male human being 👏👏👏
Trying to study Pharmacology and end here... XD \nLove you Nile!
I like how they play around and prank each other without being mean about it, like they stopped Nile from actually licking the lotion they put on his hand lol. They seem like nice friends.
You're nipples are so small it's cute.
I love u soooo much do u like Chris brown cause I loveee himmmm
Be blindfolded and go through a obstacle course
Who here just to see his abs.No homo.
If I would have know that gymnastics is a bunch of hot-shirtless guys goofing off with one another, I would have joined when I was a kid.  To be young again!  You guys really seem to have fun.  Alright, I would not be piercing my ears, but the other stuff was great.\nbye\nBrennan
All of their accents XD
U deserve more subs +1
This was trending man
TRENDING?!?!?!!???? AIGHT GO NILEEE

I should be doing my homework right now, but here I am.
Did anyone see his coaches smile get a little bigger when he started talking about the competition ❤️
In the challenge video you did with people on squad you never explained what the meaning of spinal and schmeagle was...?

My mum said I went there and I came first in that competition like you did and got a big gold medal to
Your edits are definitely getting better!
Boo.  I really wanted to see them try to flip around blind folded...
Nile there's a picture on the wall at my school
And I know James hall he used to be my coach !!!!
Hi nile I am coming to lilishore or how ever you spell it with my coach because he is in a gym corse to the home of British gymnastics and I can't wait it's a corse or double backs have any pointers I hope you reply xox
I really like how your hair looks not styled like in the beginning of the video, not that I don't love it styled but I think you should leave it natural sometimes!!

0.38 The Big Lebowski thumbs up!
R u going to the next commonwealth games If so I might see u there cause I'm going there great vid!!!
Nile, you said it's never too late to start gymnastics. However I'm 15 and 12 stone. I'm not fat either but I can't lift my own body weight and my balance is terrible plus my flexibility is bad aswell.
How tall are you? Nile
why not do the safer things with the blindfold. like handstand. swinging on the bar/rings with the foam blocks under it. or a blindfolded handstand walk race. with things on the side so you know you are going the right way.
ETA on restocking train smart t shirt?
Is coach Dave any good at gymnastics? You should do a video of you putting him through his paces 😁
Loving your video's Nile! They inspire me and put a smile on my face :) Was just wondering when the men's train smart, keep it real t-shirts will be back in stock? X
Do gymnasts live off of prize money and sponsors, just curious how it works...
Were you using a cup as a blindfold???
That redhaired gymnast is FINE!\nI hope he didn't hurt his foot...
Nile do you ever go to tramp parks or are they too dangerous (or you don't have time)for a professional athlete? You guys could literally bounce off the walls there!
Mark Wahlberg is a sequel to Nicolas Cage
Great song choice for this trailer
Just got back from the getty museum
wow finally a good movie coming out this seems legit
The Gettys are the last family anyone should make a movie on. Wasted opportunities, prostitutes, drugs, illigitimate children, unloving, greedy. Some create a better world, not these
Wow great trailer looks like a good movie!
WHAT MONEY?\nTHERE'S NO MONEY!
Cold Heartert Basterd! This will be a good film.
Why does all movie trailers come out the same time
why is the cinematography in almost all of Ridley Scott's movies so great
The fewer inheritors of a billionaire that survive, the better. Let the kid die. And guillotine his grandfather. #EatTheRich
Spoiler alert, he doesn't give into the ransom until his grandsons ear is sent to him in a package. Then his pays a portion of the ransom and his gets the kid back.... that's about it.
First movie in awhile that grabbed my attention
Good trailer. I will definitely watch all the money in the world.
I'm not sure who's trying to get an Oscar the most in this trailer.
Dude is richest ever. Should have 17 mil easy. End of movie. Let's all go home.
How much money does he aprox have?
Mark wahlberg looked like Tai Lopez in the thumbnail
Mark Walberg really?? WHY? Who makes these very very bad casting decisions.  I'm mean really, cmon.
pass on this movie........
The richest man in history of the world was the king of malli  Mansa Musa
If he paid the ransom, his entire family would be kidnapped within a year.
U wanna know about the richest people, listen to Eustace Mullins.
Ted 2 tarnishef Mark Wahlberg to the point where I cant take him seriously
And it only came at the cost of screwing all their workers.
I don't trust Ridley Scott, at all.
what song is that
Looks like such a great movie but a movie with Mark Wahlberg is always bad.
Hope they also play Eminem's part in the title song 'Rhyme or Reason'
Lol. 17 million dollars in peanuts to Gates in this scenario.
I swear if you watch the trailer of Dunkirk and this it's the same exact style with the tick tick tick... trailer is bad.
Getty isn't the richest man in history
I hope the kid did not kidnap himself.
The Rothschilds are and have always been the richest people in the world. Make a movie about them. Oh yea they own the media so that'll never happen.
Just give all an Oscar.
I'm interested in any Ridley Scott movie that isn't an Alien movie.
Want to know for sure that you are going to Heaven when you die?  \n\nJesus is the Son of the Living GOD.  The only true GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth and there can only be ONE God that actually created everything, not many... \n\nJesus Died, was Buried and Rose from the dead on the third day, proving He is GOD.\n\nJesus said in John 14:6; Jesus said to him, “I am The Way, The Truth, and The Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.”  NKJV\n\nActs 4:12 states; Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name [Jesus] under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.  NKJV\n\nJesus said in John 3:16-17; For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world (YOU) that He even gave His One and only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him as Savior shall not perish, but have eternal life.  For God did not send the Son into the world to judge and condemn the world, that is, to initiate the final judgment of the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.  AMP\n\nJesus said in John 3:3; I assure you and most solemnly say to you, unless a person is Born Again, reborn from above, spiritually transformed, renewed, sanctified, he cannot ever see and experience the kingdom of God.  AMP\n\nRomans 10:9-11 states; that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.  NKJV\n\nRomans 10:13 states; For “whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”  NKJV\n\n1 Corinthians 15:1-5 states; Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, 2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you—unless you believed in vain.  3 For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ Died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was Buried, and that He Rose Again the third day according to the Scriptures, 5 and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.  NKJV\n\nAnd REPENT...\n\nActs 17:30 Therefore God overlooked and disregarded the former ages of ignorance; but now He commands all people everywhere to REPENT [that is, to change their old way of thinking, to regret their past sins, and to seek God’s purpose for their lives].  AMP\n\nJesus said in Mark 1:15 “The [appointed period of] time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; REPENT [change your inner self—your old way of thinking, regret past sins, live your life in a way that proves REPENTANCE; seek God’s purpose for your life] and believe [with a deep, abiding trust] in the good news [regarding salvation].”  AMP\n\n1 John 3:10 In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.  NKJV\n\nFrom what I have read we know how 8 of Jesus' disciples died and all 8 of those 8 chose death rather than to simply state that Jesus had not actually rose from the dead, that they were just lying, we made it all up.  Think about that!  Would you ever choose to be murdered to maintain a complete LIE?  No you would not.  You would say “ok, ok, it was a lie”.  They would not deny their Lord to keep this life because they knew they have eternal life in Jesus because they saw Him raised from the dead.\n\nPlease get in a quiet and alone place SOON and pray to Jesus that He show you somehow if these things above are true.  If you are sincere, He will answer you…\n\nAnd don’t ever forget just as there is a GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth there is also a devil, a Satan that hates God and everything God as ever made and that means he Hates YOU and wants to deceive and trick you into believing ANYTHING except Jesus and His salvation through the cross.  Though we should never fear for God is in complete control even when we have to walk through pain in this life for a season and the devil will soon be forever in his torment and punishment.\n\nSome great scriptures to look up and read below:\n\n1 Corinthians 6:9-11\n1 Corinthians 15:1-4\n1 John 3:7-15\nMicah 6:8\nActs 17:3\nActs 18:5\nJohn 4:25-26\nMark 14:61-62\nRevelation chapters 20-22\nThe entire New Testament
Alright my fellow conspiracy enthusiasts, this trailer is dripping in Illuminati messages, can you find the clues? Reply and lemme know what you find! :D
I don't understand the point of putting a trailer before the trailer for a movie it's so obnoxious
Couldn't concentrate on the trailer because of the way they cut up time of the season lol
I love these 2 minute short films, it's so entertaining and free to watch.
Dam to live the life like that will b awesome except for the Kidd nap part 💰
Did the Nothing quote actually happen? Or did they make that up?\n\nI know Getty claimed he didn't want to pay because it would endanger his other grandchildren. More likely he was cheap as well.\n\nBut he did eventually pay a reduced amount, so it would be odd if he ever said nothing.
Rick people are dicks the movie
the music is what made this trailer
Kevin Spacey just sold this fucking movie!
Kevin spacey is a legend. This is one for the awards
Mansa musa was the richest in all history
All the Money in the World still can't make Markey Mark not Markey Mark.
Well it looks pretty good I gue- K E V I N S P A C E Y  YOU SAY WELL ILL JUST HAVE TO SEE IT THEN
$17 million dollar ransom. Smart rich people would pay $17 million to hire pro assassins or a small special forces ops to kill the abductees.
All the money in the world, but doesn't have the best security team
this movie could be good.. but was it necessary to play a full song throughout the entire trailer, at a higher volume than the dialogue
This is, uh, really weird to watch for me
How much would you pay to release your grandson if not 10 bucks?\n\nMy Grandpa: I'll pay 20 bucks to not release him
If they are so rich wouldn't 17 million dollars be like 1 buck for them🤔
is there anything that kevin spacey cannot do!!!!!!
I was so confused for the first 30 seconds of the trailer because I heard “to be a gay” in the beginning of the trailer xD
At least their being honest with what they want.
EARN $3700 IN 2WEEKS WITH $350 INVESTMENT: Binary trading has been my major means of survival and opulence over the past few years although so many brokers are trying to Tarnish my image because i stopped so many traders from loosing to them and getting back almost all they have lost and  I have always been obsessed with it since the past 3 years and try to develop where ever i may be lacking ... I created strategies everyday since the past years until I recently discovered one that has proven to beat the odds , I used two months to calculate not only the confidence rate but also the strength and likelihood of the strategy being successful and till this day it has been more than 90% accurate The  strategy  has payed off even more than I expected  and not until late  last year I became confident to share my secret and also teach those that don't know about binary option, I thank God I have been able to show a good number of people who are new millionaires now. if you seem interested: mrkhancooper@gmail.com
I need to watch this!
Nothing  That was good.

I need spoilers! I live 30 minutes from the nearest movie theater (which only screens 1 movie a week on saturdays and Sundays only). There is no way I'm gonna be able to see this movie before it comes out on DVD.
I'm not a big Aronofsky fan. And it's not because I hate smart movies with something to say, I'm intelligent and I enjoy a lot of those. But I always feel with his films that they're just so pretentious and too shove in your face the metaphors.
if they advertised it as a puzzle piece thriller, i would've definitely bought a ticket. I don't like horror movies.
Not gonna lie I'm pretty burnt out on Jennifer Lawrence, that being said I still kind of want to watch it, I need help, Jeremy hasn't really let me down yet so I'm trying to be hopeful but it's just Jennifer Lawrence, she's kinda half assed all the movies I've seen her in, then again those performances aren't really praised (ex: Hunger Games, Passengers and X-Men) but still I haven't seen another Jennifer Lawrence movie that I've really enjoyed. Will this be the movie to change my mind, please help, should I go watch it?
i'm saying the movie itself is not the movie itself it's called an allegory ;)
Hey guys, lately I've been in the movie review scene, check out my review of IT! I've heard it's up for the best internet video of the year reward?
After watching this movie I'll never be the same.......I'll never watch a trailer and think yeah this movie looks good.  This movie is better watched on kodi or anywhere you don't have to pay.  So is Jennifer the mother of what exactly because at the beginning there is another mother and at the end there is yet another can you guess? Yup another mother.  This movie did not show brutal scenes as described.  I've seen more brutal scenes on network tv shows.  Just my opinion but the mummy was a better movie and that movie was as I can only describe as dogshit taking a shit and the mummy is the result.  Mother! Is worse than that.
I absolutely loved it. By far one of the best movies of the year so far if not the best.
javier bardem looks like he could be her father, age gap
I love all aronofsky movies but this.
MOTHER I WANT MY MONEY BACK RIGHT NOW!
Why cant this guy ever make a straight forward movie?
This was a bad movie. I definitely recommend for people to stay away. No where near as good as Black Swan. I understood all the metaphors, but metaphors do not substitute for storytelling. No character development, the acting could not save what it omitted. The ending was supposed to be a surprise, but I saw it coming from the beginning. Totally disappointed. 😔
the twitter for this movie kept @ing me on twitter and they were fucking annoying!
Gyllenhaal still the biggest snub of 2000-now that was bullshit
I HATE THIS MOVIE. I REALLY WISHED I WATCHED THIS REVIEW B4 GOING IN
What the eff are you talking about? This review was just as confusing as the trailer! 😳🤔😁
why haven't you reviewed requiem for a dream yet? I've been waiting for it.
2:10 He just shows a image of the movie and I get his review of it in the recommendation list.
Didn't know they made an earthbound movie
Will we see any....\n\nAss to ass? #RequiemForADream 😁
Seems kind of like Rosemary's baby
Not even a mention for Michelle Pfeiffer's performance?
This movie is just pretentious garbage. I can applaud a filmmaker for a taking an ambitious concept and doing something bold and unique with it but this movie isn't smart or daring. Its just a shallow reimagining of the Bible, with very obvious and on the nose symbolism.  I have no idea what critics are talking about dissecting the film and creating your own interpretation when the movie isn't subtle at all with its trying to do or say.
lawerence is from kentucky close to me

If someone is shitting in a toilet, they are not really shitting in a toilet. Thats what this movie is.
I know, bat shit crazy movie like The Fountain, and The Lobster.
I have a feeling we are going to hear from oancitizen
you speaking so fast gets me nauseous
It uses Allegory mainly, not metaphor. But good video either way.
I liked Requiem but hated The Fountain.  Should I see this?
Heard the movie was really really bad
Very fair review. Definitely not for everybody and bet metaphorical. This is a movie that requires some deep thought and analysis every step of the way otherwise the meaning will be lost and you will hate it. VERY intense and anxiety producing but I thought it was great.
This movie confused me so much
jennifer lawrence is such a big star that, the  only way director can cast he,r is by giving way too much importance to her role which happens by compromising the story or the  whole movie thats why i dont like movies with jennifer lawrence.  she fucked up mystic real good.
Spoiler talk, please. Want to know your opinion on the meaning and imagery.
So, if you love blackswann, you Will love it, if not, dont waste tout Time. Thanks, i was going to pass it before your review :)
I want to see it, but my local theater isn't showing it. Fuck me.
So Javier doesn't mumble in this?, that's a first.
As a long time viewer, I love when I see your videos on trending, Jeremy. I'm like aww yeah kicking ass & taking names! :D
Your review is spot on. I just saw the movie and yeah...spot on. I loved it but I'm a huge JL fan. She was so good.
That was the most fucked up movie I've ever seen
I am a big fan of your shirt.
Will never see it in million years
the movie itself is not the movie itself. my brain hurts
Darren is way cool....love your review...I definitely need a mind trip...Darren delivers
Is this a sequel to rosemary's baby cuz the trailer looks like it
I'm hotboxing in the parking lot about to go see this movie right now
Darren Aronofsky is brilliant. I wanna see this.
though mother was home invasion  movie that trailer  make look like looks
This reminds me of all the times where i had to look for symbolism ,metaphores ,etc in literature when I watched a movie.
so.. does the movie have a Shamalan twist? It seemed like they spoiled it in trailer, but this was what I was thinking from the trailer:\nTwist: Jlaw is married to this guy who keeps inviting creepy guests in... and Javier Bardem, the husband is acting strange around her with more and more guests coming. but Jlaw is crazy.. she's delusional cuz the baby is making her hormones go wild..... she's seeing things.. like dudes walking in the shadows growling and blood on the floor and it turns out.. they are GHOULS! or... Ghastly.. homeless outcasts.. of unwanted lay waste  society.... GHOULS! and they take a woman every year and feast on their freshly born children to chill the hunger.. after the feast they prepare for the next ceremony. \n\nbut like that rose analogy.. that's not what the message is about. it's about: in our perspective of society.. we view each other as... clean... hardworking.. non-savage but in other cultures which they are okay with.. eating the  children of kids is the norm and we should learn to accept the way they act. You can't deny what people are bred and taught to do since day 1.\ndid I guess the ending? :D
Hated it, wtf did I just watch
Anyone else kind of creeped out about Jennifer being lovers with bardem? I assumed she would be his daughter
It sounds like Personal Shopper, I watched the trailer for that read a bunch of one star reviews but I was curious and I loved it, it wasn't about one thing or one character it was more of a journey and exploration. But it is a Marmite film, you either love it or hate it.
I would go insane if Jeremy was on Doug Loves Movies
At the end of black swan I stood up clapping as if I was watching a ballet live. I thought it was a master piece. Will see this movie for sure
I'm just not a Jennifer Lawrence fan,she has ruined the X-Men and every role she plays is poor me as if a hot blonde has ever had a struggle,plus her deep voice you can tell she has spent most of her life screaming and talking down to people.
I literally thought it was a Rosemary's baby remake
Nothing about mother! makes one lick of sense as Darren Aronofsky’s corny vision of madness turns more hilarious than scary. With so much crap around to clog the drain, I hesitate to label it the “Worst movie of the year” when “Worst movie of the century” fits it even better. - Rex Reed
I saw it today and I was not expecting that AT ALL! But I loved it, Jennifer was amazing as always! I don't recommended it to people who can't take something intense... because the movie was intense but I don't want to spoil anything sooo... you should watch it
Watch the Fountain to get an idea of what you are dealing with.
Oscars are pretty gay. Wrestling with a bear gave Di Caprio an Oscar long overdue and Jake Gyllenhaal didn't for nightcrawler
It's an allegory of mother earth...saw it. Typical Aronofsky movie, good movie.
my god, imagine a date with this guy.
I got a Rosemary's Baby vibe from the trailer
This film is very very uncomfortable but I loved it. It's message was so heavy handed but there's something to be said for expressing how one feels through art and that what this film did for me. It's brilliant in a very, very weird way but it has given me chills that have stayed with me this far since I saw it
I love requiem for a dream
This review actually made me more interested in the movie. I am not a fan of horror movies, which is exactly what the preview made it appear to be.
It was intense as fuck. I think people who have claustrophobia will have a hard time watching this. It was shot beautifully but not a lot of things will be answered and sometimes that is good. 8/10 for me.
The sound design (or whatever you call it) stressed me out. I felt suffocated with the close in shots, I felt like I wasn't allowed to breathe or relax.
i really like the movie it give a 9.5
I still don't understand how Jennifer Lawrence got so big so fast. She plays the same character in every movie, an overly emotional whiney misunderstood angsty girl, who can never say what's bothering her, until she's practically forced to. God I can't stand her.
After watching human centipede, I don't think much can disturb me anymore
So you're saying... IT'S METAPHORICAL!!
No ppl are not burned out on J-Law, it's her political talk has alienated 50% of the country
Don't let this distract you from the fact that Jennifer Lawrence thinks mother nature is angry..
She got political and lost half her fans
I agree about nightcrawler!
No siema Jaca praca
Not watching it!!!!!!!!!!!!🙌
waste of money
fuck jennifer lawrence

I have some friends who have a small apartment in NYC and they bought a kitchen table and cut it in half and used brackets to attach it to the wall, almost like a breakfast bar. It looks super cute and quirky!
Hi Victoria, you can buy a Turkish style little round table with folding legs. This table is low and you sit on the floor. They come in different sizes. You can bring it out when u want and fold the legs and put behind a sofa when u'r done. You might find it online or if u can get u'rself to the Harringay area of london, green lanes, there are lots of Turkish shops there. U'll definitely find one there. Maybe an idea. Xx
We use the small white square table from ikea (can't think of the name but they're £5/7) easy to pop in the corner and use to display bits but light enough to move to the sofa to eat at! My son also uses it for activities.
What a fun time!! Would definitely love a closet tour! Xoxo, Caylie
I love your makeup look for your night out in New York 👌
Another fab video ❤️ would love to see s closer tour x
Yes closet tour!!!!😘 love you victoria
a closet tour would be very cool
What about a TV tray? I don't know if that's what it's called in England. It's a personal sized table that you unfold and use for food while sitting in the couch!
How about a fold away bistro table and chairs?
What a question.  Oh course you need to do a huge Closet Tour 😍😍😍
Honestly can't wait for you to have your own house because I already know how amazing your walk in closet is gonna be! xx
Yes please to the closet tour! \nA possible idea for dining in a flat - an outdoor bistro style set with a small table and two chairs that all fold up. We've got a set in mint green and bring it inside for extra seating when we need it and it looks really cute! But of course, you'd still need somewhere to keep them whilst folded - behind the settee, behind a door, under the bed?!
closet tour please 😍
Closet tour.... YES PLEASE!!💗😘
That makeup bag 😍
Love the red jumper!! ☺️
closet tour PLZ xo
Love all the vlogs, such an amazing chance to see you in your day-to-day life! A closet tour would be absolutely fab! A totally unrelated question: where do you do your brows? They are always on fleek! (and I keep wondering for the past 5 videos I think)
You should buy some folding TV trays to eat on.
We use the oblong trays that have a cushion on the underneath for eating our meals without a diningroom table, the cushion makes it comfy and so it doesnt slide off your knees.
use a TV tray. they're individual trays on a stand you can put in front of a chair or couch. and they fold up really small. it's probably easier than sitting on the floor. but probably not super sturdy or for fancy dining. good\nluck~
I'd love to see a make up collection video 💕
Alex' look at 16:36 😂 he knows how crazy Victoria is about make up 😂 so cute
Please do a closet tour!!
You could always get little tray tables so you can sit on the couch and eat? A little like a TV dinner 😂 but they work and can be stored easily!
Also - I have a coffee table that lifts up to dining room table height. Love it!
Yes please would love to see closet don't mind it being long😀❤
I WANT TO SEE A CLOSET TOUR <3 p.s. those manolos!!
Big 👍👍👍👍👍for the video and for a future closet tour!! Secondly Welcome to the U.S. I hope that you thoroughly enjoy yourselves here! Please stay and be safe!!
Yes Victoria, we would love to see a closet tour!! can''t wait to see you at fashion week!!! Loved your watch at the end of the vlog.
You can get some cushioned lap trays. They will suffice until you get a better table solution. Great for dining and easy to store. x
So excited for you always!please do a tour please😘
Hello Victoria, thank you for a very lovely video :-) I would much appreciate a closet tour, thanks for suggesting :-) Greetings from a rainy Paris <3
Would love to see a closet tour please! Can't wait to see your vlogs from NYFW😍
Yes for a closet tour !!! You have the best fashion style of any You Tuber I know !!🙌🙌
In my apartment we use this :\nhttps://www.urbanoutfitters.com/shop/tbl-oregon-high-top-set?category=furniture&color=010\nThe stools stack and fit right under the table :)
You need a drop-leaf table. I have one that acts as a console while not being used for dining. They come in every shape and size. Love you're vlogs, they always make me smile.
aaah a closet tour *.* your style really inspires me , when i do shopping and i find something similar to your style i say to mom well that s like victoria , and i m being more brave to try and find out new things that i figure out i really like :D  , PS : those ankle boots thoe *o*
In my friends tiny apartment she had a long lounge area. She put two stools against the wall a small bar in front and couch in front of that. It worked well. Would love to see a closet tour!!
I was super excited for you when you was opening  the VB bag! \n😆❤️ It was OmG omG!
I've got the same table situation as you, and my flat is even smaller than yours. The Suki table from Habitat is amazing as it looks stylish and can fold three ways: really small and flat against a wall, pulled out as a half moon to seat two people (which is how I keep mine all the time and it takes up hardly any room in the lounge), or you can fold it out fully to seat four people. It comes in white or black. I also got the airo metal table from Habitat for when I'm on my own and just want to eat in front of the TV. It's also handy for working on laptop in the lounge, and folds down flat to store under the bed. For the Suki table we just got the metal Macadam chairs from Habitat as they come in cute colours and only cost £12 each. It meant we could get four for when we have friends over for dinner, and store two of them under the bed. Some things are on the Habitat site, and some are on Argos' Habitat section (Argos do same day delivery!).
Love your vlogs babe! Hope you had fun in NYC!! We use these trays!!! it has a cushion underneath so it's so comfy to eat with it in your lap!!!!!  http://www.dunelm.com/product/beautiful-birds-lap-tray-1000069617 xxxx
Victoria can I just say how much I love your vlogs?! Been watching you since you started your channel and absolutely love getting ready in the morning (like now) and watching these xx
J'aime! how excited you always get! Love! J'aime! Enjoy your time in NY!
Can you do a video on your favorite makeup brushes?
As far a dining table there are some tables you can store to the side or have multipurpose uses. Maybe try Ikea even if just for inspiration.
Closet tour!!!!!! I have used a small outdoor bistro table inside as a dining space-sit it as an end table between a few chairs then just adjust to eat at!! Your flat is glorious!!
wish I had your po box! wow !! \nlook forward to seeing your videos from NY
Would love to see a closet tour 💋
They have a little fold out table and two stools on urban outfitters on sale! Should still be on there. X
Victoria, love when you're trying to pronounce the Danish words hygge and lykke. Very cute 😘 wish I could write how to pronounce it 😛
I love love love your new shoes!!! I don't suppose you still have those Kurt Geiger boots with the gold heel for sale that were on your Depop? For whatever reason my Depop doesn't open and I loved those boots 😍 also, please do a closet tour!!
where is the white band you wear around your head when you do your make up from?
Hope we will be getting 'what I wore for FWNY' video with Instagram inserts like last fashion week(s) and get to hear ur process of putting outfits together, instead of solely seeing new gifted & purchased pieces.\n\nAnd for gen content I would love to see a video about multiple ways to wear one statement designer piece? Maybe starting with all the ways you wear your statement white blouses? Or maybe just choose one pair of shoes to base a look book around?! Xxxxx\n\nTweeted u about beanbag dinner trays
Alex smiling in the background as you squealed over the makeup was so cute
You're definitely my favourite now. Really enjoy your videos and look forward to the next one. I'm probably older than your usual demographic but I don't care 😀
Closet room tour please!
Cant wait for outfit post from you for this fashion week! Soo curious to see what you have chosen to wear for it :)) Those heels reminds me of something a barbie doll would wear lol so cute though :p
JonTron Video with 300,000 Views in 50 Minutes = Nowhere on the Trending Page\nFashion Video with 40,000 Views in 24 Hours = 16 On the Trending Page\n\nOut of curiosity, how much *does* is cost to bribe YouTube to be on the Trending Page?
I don't know hoe big the livingroom is but maybe smering like a walltable with some low barchairs?
Lol .. ours is tv breakfast tv lunch and TV dinner 😂😂😂😂
creased when alex was watching what you got gifted then realised it was make up and lost interest 😂
We used to live in a small flat in London and had a table similar to this. It can go from a normal height coffee table to a fold out dining table. It's kind of two sides of a table on top of each other which swivel and fold outwards. Or you can keep it smaller and just raise the height. It was honestly perfect! I think the brand was Callagaris we bought it from a furniture shop in spitalfields \n\nhttps://www.heals.com/magic-j-table.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6YXbsY2n1gIVQr7tCh2g3A7TEAQYFyABEgJJlvD_BwE\n\nI can't find the calligaris one we had but it was more like this https://www.styleourhome.com/mascotte-wenge-multi-purpose-table.html?utm_source=google_shopping&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsdDaiJGn1gIVZ7vtCh1ZlASaEAQYCCABEgJl6_D_BwE\n\nWe used it for 7 years and my bro now has it in his flat another 7 yes on and the mechanism still works perfectly xx
You really have opening products with your left hand down pat.  Victoria Beckham - how wonderful.  Alex is really cute and patient half watching you on the bed lol.
what is name of your favorite ray bane sunglasses ? i cant remember .... :/ also it is soooo sweet to see how you shine when you are with your boyfriend
Victoria, you really shouldn't hang your knitwear, it's going to ruin it in the long run (I've learned it the hard way!)
your skin looks beautiful!
why are you so nervous??
i was expecting a video and got a vlog😤
I have that type of snake
I would love to be in that cage with that snake!!! Lol really though I really like snakes 😂😂😂
I miss the fact type videos like weirdest deaths, like if you agree
I'mma be that person. Me telling me about how I'm not concerned about a situation (e.g.  it's okay that you're late, you'll be fine) is different from describing how another person is dealing with a situation (e.g. she is going to be fine, even though she is late). Obviously in Link's case, the science applied, but I don't think this is what was meant in the long run. Though I'm tempted to try both, as are you, me.
You need to test talking in the first person.
my mom loves boas, she had a red tail boa when she was little.😆
Did they torture Link because he tends to react more emotionally? Someone needs to torture Rhett.
Rhett Was so proud to say that in the intro lol
As someone who has grown up loving lizards and snakes, it's so strange to see people who are so afraid of them. But then I remember I have severe emetophobia which is a completely ridiculous fear, so I try to be more understanding.
I love snakes! I have 5

I am link and link is* the serpent king
Now put a bird eating tarantula
Am I the only one that thinks that the bigger the snake the more adorable it is.
It's because it helps distract you. You don't have to talk in the third person or even yourself to do this. You just have to talk or think about something else and distract yourself from the stressful present.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I would love to be in there with that snake 😍😍😍😍😍😍 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Link is wearing those Red Wings, I see the selvedged jeans. What brand?
A man is not link. A man is nobody. A man has many faces.
7 years ago on Sep 14 2010 the backwords video came out
Sad thing this is recorded in a studio not in a bedroom or work room
If my head was in a tank with spiders I'd probably vomit and pass out.
Cool new intro guys you really went all out keep up the good work.
i can completely back this up as a valid theory. when i was around 15 years old. i convinced myself i was superman so i could jump of a roof so i could run away (i'm scared of heights). i have always wondered how i actually managed that, and now i have my answer. thanks!
Or maybe its just a placebo
The new name of Rhett: 'Rhettster'
I'm gonna try this when I have anxiety
you can do it serpent king
I bitey my nails and talk to my self when I'm alone in a room.
I always talk to myself a lot of times in third person when I'm stressed as my natural reaction. But it's not like ella is going to calm down now like link was doing its more like ok, ella, calm down, your gonna be ok
Chances are that I would be in a building, so I would remain there until my food ran out, and try to figure out a plan in the mean time.
There's a difference between talking about yourself in the 3rd person and talking to yourself in the 3rd person.
no grav = no sad made for neice of cousooon where grav is high enough for sad no grav. #QTMBA
The word Link has lost all meaning haha
You can do it serpent king
by the end of this episode link didn't even sound like a word anymore
ok I want a tank setup like this, just so I can put snakes and other cute animals in there and stick my head in
You can see that Link is about to cry
When link sais link so much you forget who link actually is.
Link has some salt and pepper going on in his hair. 🙂
I just started school at the University of Michigan, I got so excited when Rhett said it
I know that they want to include the crew's laughs and stuff, but 1. it gets annoying (which makes me not want to watch GMM if I will be honest) 2. You can hear the background noise of the crew moving or something, which is REALLY annoying.
#qtmba  hope fully I will be inside when I happens. I will start planning how to make hallways and handrails connecting all the buildings.
Can Link breathe through his anus? He's gonna try, he knows he can breathe out through his anus, but can he breathe in through his anus?\n-Link\n\nI spat my morning coffee...
My brother says stuff in third person its kinda weird
You can do it snake king!
Tris is a really pretty snake 🐍\nI have a columbian boa too
Oh my gosh, that adorable snake shares the same name as me! <3 My name is Tris haha
Snakes on a brain.
is no one going to talk about how they weren't talking to themselves , they were talking about themselves . i'm pretty sure they were supposed to be saying like it will be okay link \nnot link is not okay
there's practically nothing to worry about. Boa's are constrictors, so these squeeze the life out of animals. They RARELY go after humans.\n\n\n\nThey aren't even poisonous or venomous. It's pure bite power you need to worry about. But again, the Boa will only defend itself as a last resort, because it's a defense mechanism. \n\n\n I'd try this out.
Link is going to murder Rhett in his sleep.
I think what worked was Link not thinking about the snake and taking his mind away from the snake.
All of you saying he wasn't talking in third person because he was narrating obviously don't know what third person is. Narration is third person. First person= I/we, Second person= You, Third person= They/He/She/It. Instead of saying He over and over he said Link over and over. Still third person just more specific. So technically he did this right since he was supposed to speak about himself in third person. Y'all just need to take another English class.
When I was watching this on friday, seidimeow was the top comment.\n(Ps. I hate snakes too)\nWhat I am afraid of with snakes are the tooth. And them on the necks.
Just a very few seconds and your neck and throat is crushed
Can you please go back to your old hair Rhett and the OLD intro song? That was the good stuff👍
A female  red tail?!!!! In snakes, the females are larger!!!!!
Link sounds like that ailan from home you know? Or Dobby from Harry Potter \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Btw this is my mum account)
Poor Link. I'm super proud of him though (3
That snake was so beautiful. I would have loved to be in the tank :D
Is that Tai Lopez?
Was that snake boiled for safety?
Can Link breathe in through his anus?
Phew, now I know it's perfectly okay for me to talk to meself! xD. Plan of action: Get everyone into a building as fast as possible so we don't fly away into outer space. That would be terrible. LOL
I can't wait for you to come to my school i go to discovery elemetry in Waite park mn. Peytien
I can breathe in through my anus.
Me: (Sees the clipart) Link You gonna dieeeee!!!! Noeeeeeeeee!!!!!! Linnnnnnnkkkkkkk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n*sees vid*\nRhett you sly dooooggg ;)\n*sees they're using actual snake* LINKS GONNA DIEEEEE NOOOOOEEEEEEEEEE THAT SNAKES GONNA KILL HIM GONNA SUFFOCATE HIM \nGOOD MYTHICAL MORNING ARMY IS GONNA KILL THAT SNAKE IF IT HUGS LINK TO DEATH BUT I HATE SNAKES BUT........
I'd pay for a podcast spin-off called Link Thinks \nWhere Link talks in third person asking the kind of questions you ask yourself while in the shower.
And this dull not say link a million DAMN times!!! Disliked
Poor Link, from the look on his face at the beginning of the video, I don't think he knew the whole premise of the video.\nLink is my hero.  That was so brave.  Not only putting his head in that tank, but putting his head BACK in the tank after seeing the snake, knowing he wouldn't be able to use his hands to fend it off.  Who needs caffeine when you can have your best friend scare you silly by building a tank terror tank.
Link has grey hair
Always trending
poor Link lol
Link is broken
#32 on trending!!

Who else talks to themselves in 3rd person sometimes? 😎😁😄
i say 'you can do it serpent king' all the time to my friends and they always are confused by i think it's funny so i don't stop and laugh quietly to my self
There's a picture of a serpent with a crown on it in the background! SERPENT KING!

Batty? Isn't that homophobic, I should write for tabloids, this just in Judi Dench is a Dench homophobe
I hate this kind of music.
Fucking pathetic.
Never seen so many white people in London in my life.
So you pay cash for Videos?
Thats what you call support
Very good support!!! Its normal for germany! \nWhere the arsenal supporters????\nBest greets to wilde horde &  northside do
I wish every club has fans like them who support the club where ever they go or however to do
DEUTSCHLAND ÜBER ALLES.
Where are the fights?\nA handfull of idiots misbehave and you cunt jump on the bandwaggon and call the whole fan crowd shit.\nOur fans tried to hold them back, but you cant stop them.
Firstly I'm not your mate. They do need to advertise. There all over there country. You been to Germany recently? They've got big problems. But your right there far better ignoring it. Marching through the streets of London causing mayhem for a football match.
3-1 you cunts.. delaying a game by an hour because you're all poor
maybe this will make you realise how plastic your fans and league really are
Hitler is proud.
very embarrassing for Arsenal......totally taken.  UP THE CLARETS   BFC
What atmosphere!!! I love football with piece!!!!!
Brilliant. That is proper support! Get to England no matter what and enjoy it. Fair play why are people moaning!
cash 4 videos?  i have a video of me masturbating in stockings while looking at xhamster.... how much do i get for that?
And they sing in the hosting countries language... well done ;-D
So the arsenal ultras are pussies? They lost their home stadium what a disgrace.
So do you pay cash for videos?
I wonder if they pay cash for videos...
We get it you pay cash for videos
Wenger out brigade's​ looking stronger and stronger by the day

Makes me wonder... where all these men are while Muslim immigrants were raping there women and beating people up on the streets in Germany on a regular basis.
wellcome in Belgrade...Red Star Belgrade
Nice corteo respect from ultras malaya Malaysia english are pussy.
The germans...
English football hooligans are none existent nowadays.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXV2Y7Hvx4I
maybe insted of caring about shitty fooball so much they should march on the fuckin muslims.
They are politically right or left?
I first thought Kolasniac's goal was the more difficult one but the Alex goal was just freaking ridiculous
its easy 4 german fans to come to england we Serbians dont have money
Come to Belgrade nazi scum!
FORZA GERMAN ULTRAS
Germans just taking over London like the should have during WW2 long live the Fatherland 88 Forever 🇮🇪
Take over London ? They lost and are bottom of the Bundersleague !
So why dont they buy tickets?
They won't try this in italy
Fuck me this brings back memories of 80's.... good and bad... apparently Arsenal knew they were coming Arsenal fans sold tickets on black market. BUT WORSE THAN THAT ARSENAL ALLOWED COLOGNE FANS TO BUY MEMBERSHIP FROM ARSENAL FC (TYPICAL GOONERS) COULDN'T ORGANISE A PISS UP IN A BREWERY. CRYING  BECAUSE REAL REAL FANS COME TO YOUR GROUND. YOU SHOULD HAVE OUT SUNG THEM INSTEAD OF WINGING ON SOCIAL MEDIA THERE WERE ONLY 5 ARRESTS PROBABLY THE AS MOST MATCH DAYS.... YO UNITED YO UNITED
WHAT IS UEFA GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS
Koln = SS Nazi
FCP dragons piss on these nazi cunts
Filthy Germans go kill some jews and allow some more paedophile Muslims to rape your kids.
Most hotels Ive been to have shit toilet paper which makes your butt hurt after 2 uses, it's never soft just hard and abrasive
I've never been to a hotel with good toilet paper. We just but toilet whenever we get there.
Ever thought of using a bidet?
T H I C C B U T T
Solution: use water instead of/along with toilet paper. It will change your life :)
Did this mans just write a trap song about buttocks?
I wondered why the music was building... now I know.  :D
Did I just watch a whole 4 minutes about butt rubbing...?
The dance break was so zefrank
Hank droppin some *FIRE* with that song.... LOLZ.... anyone else want him to make a full length version? Am I the only one?
Haha ... the Butt Song held a hint of Flight of the Conchords.
Why didn't you just buy some toilet paper? :D Also in Australia there is a price per 100 sheets on toilet paper :) In future, try Quilton 3 ply if you're ever back here.
I'd like to point out that the hand-movement for confusing the american people is the same as those are your butt cheeks.\nHank, we wouldn't want to create unncessarey confusion now, wouldn't we?
This really felt like one of Hanks videos from like 2010. Nostalgia is pretty sweet.
This is one of the best rants I have ever seen you do, Hank. Am going to have to watch it again for the butt cheek rap. And you're completely right about cheap, rough toilet paper. That stuff should be banned.
You can buy real nice toilet paper here. I get the nice stuff. You don't tend to in public spaces though; even in fancy hotels.
Hank, you may be interested in the Sweet Home. The do reviews on many products -- including toilet paper [https://goo.gl/FUqkJG ]
The fact that this started to trend, oh goodness lmao
The rap was unexpected excellence on the weirdest nerd(fighteria) level lol great Goofy video, Hank.
I use both a toilet water spray and toilet paper, and I can say without the shadow of a doubt that the toilet water spray is much better. Toilet paper feels archaic and less hygienic.
Charmin used to make travel sized toilet paper rolls. Idk if they do anymore, though; a quick googling didn't turn up much other than an Amazon listing that said it's currently unavailable.  I know other brands make travel rolls, particularly for camping and the like, but I have no idea if they're any good quality-wise. On the other hand, though, Charmin and several other companies do make travel packs of flushable wet wipes, which might be better in your situation.
Weird Hank! So glad to see you back!
Hank layin' down some capital T Truth for us all. TESTIFY!
I'm sorry we don't have bidets.
When I was on a mission in Russia, the toilet paper was freaking AWFUL
Rule #1 of adulting. You don't skimp on toilet paper.
Ppsssst..... The bears use Charmin...... Downey is a fabric softener that does use a bear but...it's not FOR your butt
Butt cheeks song needs to go into full song mode. Like full song mode. But I have no money so somebody else needs to pay him to do that.
It's fucking toilet paper, clean your ass with it.  1st world problems...
Funnily enough in Australia, prices for stuff in supermarkets comes with some sort of cost/measurement on every label, usually per 100grams. Though for toilet paper they have a cost per 100 sheets or something along those lines.
My favourite part parts parishioners Downy is a fabric softener. Not TP. Just, so great. 😅
It's because they used recycled toilet paper that's super big in Australia.
im a bit drunk so i dont know if i was projecting or whatever, but was hank tipsy because i was laughing so dang hard oh my god i love when hank gets silly go hank i love you man youre the reason i know anything brother

We Australians have evolved to have iron butts, it is the only way we can survive the spider bites
the worst toilet paper i've ever used was in penn station. i could practically see through it. 🙄
Please be jet lagged every day. 😂 (also, this butt problem having friend agrees so much.)
as an Australian... y'all need Kleenex Cottonelle \n\n(and as someone who has lived in UK, it's worse there)
I didn't actually think this video could get weirder but wow it did
I think it's about time that the world adopts bidets. It's obviously the most superior method for cleaning your behind. It's environmentally friendly and there is NO chafing involved. Plus it's just a better clean than wiping some dry paper around and hoping for the best. I fail to understand why everyone hasn't gotten behind this yet.
screw the deathly hallows screw the angler fish screw everything this is by far hanks best song ever omg thank you for that.
We need a full length butt cheeks song!
I'm Aussie & use a bidet at home :)\nDid you know you can get portable bidets that fit into your bag / pocket?  They are like a little water pistol.  Yeah, we're in the future.
Hey, for the book tour, will there be an actual meet and greet or will it just be a stage performance?
Everyone has that one thing in their life that, no mater how frugal or impoverished or thrifty you are, on which you will spare no expense. Something where you have drawn your line in the sand, that this thing is important enough that you will not compromise. For those suffering 'pant area unpleasantness', it makes complete sense that Toilet Paper Quality is that line. When something is that vital to your daily well-being, you *make* it a priority with whatever resources you have.\n\nTo those looking in from the outside, it can seem completely nonsensical what that uncompromising line is, but there's always a reason, and it's almost always deeply personal.
God I love when people put this kind of shit up (pun intended). As someone with IBD, it's good to laugh about this stuff 😂!
That rap is essentially one of my favorite things on this planet.
I need a full version of that song.
Been watching Vbros for the better part of a decade. This is the best episode I've ever witnessed.
This is easily the best vlogbrothers video in like a long time
Officially the greatest of all the vlogbrothers videos.
When will y'all start using the water jet (tiny hand shower) to wash your butts? I wouldn't be okay with just wiping knowing it's not washed clean. I'm from India btw. 😝
Hank why don't you use wet wipes/baby wipes that's what my family does, they also have some that are easy for traveling
+ this video if youre watching it while using the restoom.
I have a new favorite song -- These are Your Butt Cheeks!  Toilet paper companies started thinning and removing plies and to keep costs down.  This creates a lot of problems if you have problems.  I used to belong to the most-on-a-roll club, but I now agree that the bears are best.
I feel like Hank was drunk when filming this.
Is more expensive toilet paper really better? Like, is there a higher thread-count or whatever? Is there a qualitative difference. I want to know.
I am fortunately not a human with butt problems, but I get the frustration of places that should have nice toilet paper just not doing that. Like the place I work over the summer has had at most four people working there in the past few years, so buying the nice stuff would be a rather small expense. But no, literally that less-than-paper-thin cheapest stuff that I know we've all experienced.  I literally brought a roll of the nice stuff from home in after a few weeks because my coworker and I deserved better than that garbage. We all deserve better. Viva la butt-revolution!
the butt cheeks bit didn't need a song but i'm really, really glad you made it one
This feels like an old vlogbrothers video and I'm so happy right now. Not that their recent videos aren't amazing, they're just good in different ways. It made me smile:)
Everywhere abroad has terrible toilet paper. It makes me think that our toilet paper has something really bad in it. I'm 50/50 on if I care. I care a lot less at the end of a trip abroad.
Hank, I've got two words for you...baby wipes. They are a godsend.
Omg I love this video. It felt very old school.
This was really weird but I could relate
I'm sorry. I don't know what just happened. The jet lag is strong in this one.
This is the best video on the internet.
Not sponsored but wish you were?
I like to bring baby wipes with me. Then I don't have to worry about it.
Hank...I have UC and IBS, so I definitely understand! The softest TP is Charmin Soft. Trust me...I've tried them all. Especially for traveling, Kandoo wipes are awesome! You can find them in the diaper aisle and they're truly flushable. They're a life and butt saver!
I apologize on behalf on my country and our disgraceful toilet paper!
Ok, made it to 3 minutes and 50 seconds. I have to tap out. I haven't seen a vlogbrothers video in a while I think I need another break.
so to you, australian toilet paper is a pain in the ass
As someone with UC, I feel this so hard. Particularly as an individual who works in a corporate office environment!
Buy a small travel package of baby wipes if you find yourself in this situation.  Just please be sure to throw them away and do NOT flush them.
Given that butt problems can ruin days of your life tells me a lot about your political opinions
Of course Naperville, IL is sold out, but a place like Indianapolis isn't.
Often we use recycled toilet paper because it's better for the environment and it's not always as soft as non-recycled.
I love jetlagged Hank.
what just happened
Jet-lagged Hank is my favourite Hank
I love Hank 😂❤
I...um... yeah that happened. Ok.
The ideal clickbait title
Soft, absorbant tt VS. Ghirardelli Orange & Almond bar 😢😭
WASH YOUR ASS!
I love this
wtf Hank
🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Hank Green, Professional Video
Uh, wow?
that was thoroughly amusing, thankyou hank. 😅
Hank, wtf.
XD *APPLAUSE* QUALITY CONTENT.
Hank stops for a Trap session. Lulz
ewhat
Slow vlog brothers day?
Public toilet paper sucks in Australia.
#firstworldproblems
Iron Butts unite!
one wipe Charles
Jp is such a know it all
The drone sequence starting at 9:00 is 🔥👌✌👍👊.
just how long did it actually take the poor guy to get the tyre back on the rim?
Guy breaks his back changing the tire and JP just comments he could have done it much easier. Terrible attitude.
1 person working hard, surrounded by 3 narcissistic morons with cameras. Come on - grow up Louis!
Epic Vlog! Those drone shots were amazing
Amazing vlog Louis !
Rate the music
That Nissan looks badass!  I love how they widened the track and put those big wide tires on it with the lift kit! The took out a little too much air out of those tires though, they should've inflated them once the got off the snow.
😢❤I learn English just for you louis .
We're only at episode 17 and I'm already thinking, 'how could you possibly fit all of this in to one film.'
The kitten's not small. Louis' got big feet!
Louie, another fantastic upload! wow the scenery was breathtaking......love your kind spirt it shines perpetually....cannot wait for more....xxxx
I actually went hiking over those glaciers a little over a week ago as part of a course in my school. The path is called Fimmvörðuháls and it's really beautiful and takes around 9 hours. On the second day we actually went into that canyon you went into!\n\nAwesome to have you in Iceland!
Amazing vlog this is by far the best in the series well done Iceland is an incredible  place
I was thinking the jack was looking a little sketchy. At 6:09 the guy is under wheel arch and seconds after he removes himself, the jack gives way. If jack gave way totally while he was under the wheel arch,  it could have easily crushed him to death.
There is no place on earth like Iceland
Iceland looks better in England
That drone footage is just so epic!! Makes me really want to buy another one.
Drone shots from iceland are always amazing! i can't wait to see the documentary!
he most smell
Wheels to flat !
:)
wonderful adventure, excellent composition
Just amazing Louis
Beautiful footage!
That kitten wasn't sleeping, it was knocked out ! :D
Louis would be the worst person to have in a crisis lmao 😂
Is no one going to mention 7:21? Lol
One day I hope to get stranded in Iceland... seems like a pretty good experience!
Most loneliest?!!!!
This vídeo was AWESOME!!! Tks Louis!!!
Absolutely amazing footage with the drone!
WHERE WAS THE SWEET POP LOUIS!!!!???
Awsome drone footage!
Kitten was absolutely adorable! Amazing videos btw
Just wow! A place to visit in the future for sure :)
If you guys need help or a place to sleep in the Netherlands, let me know. Have fun and fly safe.
The self pumping mechanism is so cool
I've learned from experience that it isn't a good Jeep ride unless something goes wrong. 😂 Anyways great vlog again like always.
On trending, well done Louis!
listen carefully at 0.36
tune 9:00 - 11:00 ? so lush
Great video and fantastic landscapes. Thanks for sharing.
What's the music at 1:00 ?
Do you carry visas for every country you land on ?
WOW.. that waterfall
It's very possible that the driver would not let them help - it's his responsibility to keep the vehicle in good shape and there are always legal rules in these kind of commercial\nSituations as well.
when the tire came off the car the guy should have put the lifting jack on the side of the car, then he wouldnt have had to do all the digging and it would be much easier to put the tire back in place.
Beautiful 🙌🏼
4k takes to long to upload ...1080 is fine ..upload the 4k versions after the trip is done
Wow - Louis your drone shots are stunning !
SELASSIE ARMY!!!
Awesome video, thank you for sharing.
best vlogging on youtube now
Iceland is actually the coolest place in the world :)
Louis try having an overall theme for your interviews with everyone (maybe even ask a few of the same questions to each and then edit tgr the result for the documentary) and then wing it from there based on the culture, situation of the day, etc. I think it would make the interviews more entertaining and flow nicer.
Have Louis fly to his gal pal and do some 2 minute uploads if that.
With 20/20 hindsight bolt-on bead-locks would be a good idea on those rims !
I remember when that volcano went off, I was 'stuck' in the Caribbean for 5 days...
Continuing to the top of the glacier without a spare and no water? Pretty ballsy.
Yay that's my country ❤
How people like RiceGum get 7 mil subs and Louis is on 2 mil is ridiculous, Louis' vlogs are well edited and he does great things for society like charity work and stuff, yet Ricegum just produces absolute aids. Smh.
You guys need to do a tour of Canada. It would be so interesting.
You need to visit the blue lagoon
The whole time I was thinking this would be an epic game of thrones place
What an amazing place! I knew that but these images were something special..
Oh what an adventure, what an adventure..!
Landscape remind me Reunion Islans (without the snow). You should try it!
Love these vlogs Louis! They make me so happy and brighten my day!
stranded in iceland !! Feeling like Jon snow...
Where they going next the Faroe Islands
Hey Louis, I reeeeallly would like to know your exact setup on the wing of your Cessna; what 360cam and mount are you using???
Thanks so much for the footage & edit! Appreciate it very very much!
The most amazing shots from the drone when you are at the top! Amazing. Amazing. Amazing moment and perfect music to compliment. One of my favourite fun for Louis moments of all time! I have never commented on a video of your before today and I have watched you religiously for about three years. I didn't even subscribe until today- that moment made me actually sign up. What a amazing adventure you are on - can't wait for the whole adventure to unfold! Hannah xx
am I the only one who's scared for the gigantic lens being used on that camera without the tripod mount??
These world flight videos just keep getting better and better Louis!
Helge is The Man! 💪👈✅
no chains or spare or just in case emergency gear??? Wow...they need to review safety policy! ...or do they have one?😨😲😱
Apparently they're in Greece at the moment, but the gps has stopped at Austria. I wonder what happened.
I honestly don't think the documentary will be as epic as we might think.. It'll be like a really long good vlog
Let's get Louis to 1M!!!
Loui I just curious did u block ur subscribe button , u posting best videos on YouTube still u didn't reached 2m subs, people who posting shi** got more than 10 m .... pls double check your account....🤔🤔
Such awesome scenery. Love the bit of you at the top spreading your arms out
I was told in school iceland is more green and greenland is more ice
That drone footage of the truck was brilliant......I loved that last bit too,,,yeah, were in a bit of a mess here with all the chargers and everything .       Louis,  I would freak out if that was my house,  tidy your stuff up!
There are certainly worse places to get stranded, that part of Iceland is just breath-taking.  I shall be there in 2 weeks, I can't wait.
as always thank you 👏🏼
Looking forward to you flying to the Uk. If you fly over Southport near Liverpool give me a wave.
Didn't hear you pronounce the volcano Eyjafjallajökull :)
Who's down for a Cheeky little coffee with Louis? You can count me in when they arrive in Kern Valley airport!
Wow!  That was an amazing shot of the tire coming off the wheel!  5 psi... That is crazy low, but what a cool vehicle to be traveling up the mountain in!
That song from the montage is lush.\n\nToo Far Away - Direct.
JP adding his what I would do input was pretty useless as no one was helping the dude.
That sweet pump's coming -JP
Thought Louis was gonna eat the kitten
What country is this
3 guys watching and laughing while 1 guy who is doing all the work???
Hopefully you guys bought him a beer or gave him a good tip for his hard work. Next time take turns digging. As a team it could of moved things alot faster even if he said no say no i insist, make sure he knows theres still good folks out there to help.
Jesus,  at least get a lil dirt under your nails! \nNot cool leaving one man to do all the graft. \n7mins before ya offered oh the airs going in #facepalm
Duke is absolutely the most adorable doggy I've ever seen!
OMG Amelia KEEP THE SHOES! They're so special. So different. You will regret sending them back!!! They will add a pop of something to plain outfits. Black dress...bam...star shoes. Jumpsuit....bam....star shoes. Leather trousers and blazer....bam...star shoes. Simple outfits made interesting with star shoes. They're the kind of shoes that you'll be trying on outfits and think, OOh you know what would make this look awesome?, star shoes. But wait, I sent them back..... No.
KEEP THEM! xx
✋
Keep them!!!
Love the Star shoes!!

The shaft/upper of the boots is so  flattering and hugs your legs, but I question why the toe box is so super pointy, but you wear many skirts and I could see you getting use/many wears out of them in especially fall/winter!

This was one of my favourite vlogs!!!
Can somebody help me out and tell me what video Amelia was making dinner and made those baked apples? I tried it roughly and it didn't come out that great and I wanted to see how she made them! Appreciate it! Thx!!!! 😜🍎🍎🍎
Loved,loved your vlog 😍😍and please do a house tour of your friends apartment. It looks like every girls dream. I am always confused of your house,do you have two kitchens?

Loving the Givenchy bag!! House tour please✋👌✋👌✋👌✋
Aww! Best wishes to Natasha!! She is always so sweet in your vlogs, over the years!! Xoxoxo 🙏🏼☺️🙌🏼💙
Your look so beautiful in this vlog, love your new hair, eye makeup without wing liner and that skirt, so pretty!
I love that depiboo took your hair darker for fall.... autumn?.... fall. Fall sounds better 😂 It looks incredible anyway, as does the tan skirt. The knife boots make me think of Devil Wears Prada and those star shoes though 😍😍😍
any small YouTubers want to be friends ?❤️❤️
Love you Amelia ;) Always great to see you sweet heart 💕And Loooove your new hair xxx
Love the shoes, dislike the boots. Your mom's so sweet.
I thought I spotted some pastel pink! Looks very beautiful!!
Okra and eggplant tray bake. Snap off the tips of okra, slice eggplant in half, brush with oil and bake! (Or roast, whatever)
Keep the star shoes!!!!!!
Oribe = Oar-bae  :)  According to my hairdresser when I pronounced it Oh-reeb.  I do wish you would feature your mother more.  She is more my demographic and I would to hear her beauty and hair tips.  I may have to start a letter writing campaign for her to start her own channel.
I feel like buying stuff online with the mindset of just being able to return isn't v considerate of yer carbon footprint and the environment. Just something to consider if you care!
JonTron Video with 300,000 Views in 50 Minutes = Nowhere on the Trending Page\n50,000 Views in 2 Day = 17 On the Trending Page\n\nOut of curiosity, how much *does* is cost to bribe YouTube to be on the Trending Page?
If you just put the okura in the boiling hot water to cook, it takes no time at all to prepare it. Dip them in soy sauce to eat. Really simple!
YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE! Keep them! ✨
You are so beautiful Amelia !! JUST stunning 😍😍😍😍
Yes to to the shoes! New Years!
You so need those star shoes in your life Amelia! Your hair is amazing! xo
Hi Amelia,\n\nObsessed with Phillipa's pad! I am moving in a month, I wish you could do a tour soon... But I'll be happy if you at least tell me what kind of curtains those are (like the specific curtain slang for it) Living for that wallpaper btw gonna ask my landlord if I can wallpaper the loo lol!
You NEED to keep the star shoes they are insanely beautiful ✨✨✨✨
keep the heels!!!! ⭐️ love them!!!!
Keep the star shoes !!!!!
in LOVE with your hair!
The shoes aren't that badly priced. Keep them and get the gold pair as well. 😏
i like the star shoe more than the boots LOL
LOVE the shoes!! I'd definitely keep them!
YOU NEED THE SHOES 😍😍😍 You can use them with so many things, I think it would be a good investment!!\nThe fall vibes in your outfits omg I just love fall...
That shoe is shouting your name so please keep it..........
I'm with the sam as ur Mom, if yr unsure after that long then they aren't for you.
Wow your new hair looks gorgeous suits you and are appropiate to this colder season! Those star shoes are cute,and I am the type of person that would keep something just because they look cool lol,but if you dont wanna keep them because you might not wear them then return it :))
OK so the star shoes are a keeper but maybe look a half size too big? The knife boots are horrible though. Try the dolce vita or stuart weitzman sock boot. <3
Can't wait for Philippa's house tour! 😍😍😍
Keep the shoes girl 😂
'duke' reminds me of duke from tracy beaker

Isn't it fun getting to the point where you can eat in moderation and have a good time!!!! 💘
What a great video! We got to see Paris with a Melanie voiceover. :)  Nice. BTW, the red dress looks great on you IMHO.
That was a freaking joy to watch!!! Thank you for that wonderful morning boost Melanie. I loved your editing too btw with the beautiful French music, and beautiful choices too, it was so well done!! :D xx
I just died at 13:01. You are so great xD
Ethical omnivorism:):):):) yet...you have no idea where your salmon etc came from! LOVE IT !!!! You're so logical and smart Melanie!!!!!
Loved this video!!! Made me want to go to Paris so bad, especially with someone as lovely as you Mel :)
The Hunchback of Notre Dame is my ALL TIME FAVORITE Disney movie, and it is CRIMINALLY UNDERRATED!  THANK YOU for loving it too!  I'm glad you had such a fun time!
Hehehe, I joined in with your devious laugh at 6:46. You did a wonderful job putting this vlog together! The music, food, and everything else just complimented it so well. I also want to add that you looked unbelievably gorgeous in each dress. Seems like you had a great time!
Being a giant Les mis fan the music made this video so great!!! Loved it Mel, great video!!:) 😘
Have you heard the original of Tous les memes by Stromae? It's the best!!
I love this vlog ! Paris is so lovely ! I appreciate so much your good taste in french music in this video ! 😊😊😊
Currently eating a giant package of crisps...
Those weird fruit look like Tunas, we have them here in Chile, don't know if the ones in Paris are the same, but if they are, try them, they're DELICIOUS and juicy, perfect for summer!
Wonderful video!!!! (As always) 😊 also where are your boots from? I'm on the look out for a pair for the wintery months and your ones are perfect!
Where is that stripey red/pink and white shirt from?
Noooo, Nutella is an Italian product ❤ It was created by the Ferrero family, who lives in Alba, Piedmont (northern Italy). You should definitely come and visit this beautiful city, where you can find scrumptious food as well as fine wine 😉 By the way, love your channel ❤
i LOVE DaVinci Code! Also, would you belive ive Never tried nutella before? not sure why.
really really really enjoyed this video much love :)
Aaaaaw i have missed the fdf!!! Love love love it.❤️\nWould you ever Concider doing Daily vlogs once in awhile? That would be amazing, you are simply an incredible inspiration!\nHuuuuuge respect!\nLove💚
I'm so happy you enjoyed your stay! The weather was absolute crap this past week, but the food sure makes up for it :) Please do come back, we always welcome beautiful mademoiselle in the ville des lumières <3
Hi Melanie!! Loved the vlog, you should go to Italy next time for a food diary and ps. Your dad is hilarious, he should be more in the vlogs!!
You saying wow like owen wilson killed me 😂
OH MY GOD Melanie it feels so weird that you were in my city!! My favorite place is Beaubourg (you're there at 2:49)! Such a shame I had classes these days we could have crossed paths<3
I loved this <3 The music was so perfect for this vlog too! xxx
omg where did you get your yellow coat from?? it's gorg!!
glad you enjoyed paris, but i was visiting dublin while you were away, which sucks thought i might bump into you!! saw your book in stores for the first time and was v proud <33
I miss Paris so much 😭😭
Love your new hairstyle..especially your fringe :)..btw nutella is actually Italian :)
Loved the style of this vlog so much, Mel! Very raw and artistic... Also, loved seeing u in Paris, you look like Amelie so much with your new fringe, I could totally see you living in a cute apartment in Montmartre, wearing those dresses! All the beige food ahhh, I swear I could live off baguettes in Paris! 💛
ugh this makes me want to go to Paris and eat and drink everything!
this is great please do more food diaries!! any country would be cool, i love seeing food from around the world
Nooooo, you were there and I didn't know ! You were soooo close to me when you were at hôtel de ville, notre dame, le gay choc and le Louvre . Maybe next time if you need some advise 🤷🏾‍♀️.
Such an enchanting little film of Paris! <3 xx
I'm so jealous!! Paris is my absolute dream 😍 What's it like being an English speaking tourist there? I've been learning French the past two years, but I still barely understand it lol. But I want to go soon!!
I am going to be in paris as well in 2 days 😊 maybe i will see you there :)) are the People nice there ?
You look so happy in this video ❤ And you made me hungry again...
You might think of me as an ungrateful idiot but I live just outside of Paris and work in the center Paris but I don't like Paris. I have many reasons but the main one is that I was born and grew up in the French countryside, the seaside specifically and I miss it so very much. Anyway, I'm glad you enjoyed your stay so much that you want to come back, it's true that the city has a lot to offer and I liked it for visit but living here is definitely not for me. Maybe I'll see you around when/if you come back :)
That Fruit 6.13 in France really wowww cool yumm, prickly pears are my fav, use to pick em' on cousins property, never see em' in stores where i live - yay France is Cool! Naww Amelie gotta dig it out of the cupboard haven't seen in too long! And don't get me started on Disney aww it's simply love. Your outfits were on point, cute dresses, that coat yess ftw
i feel so at home whenever i watch any of melanie's videos that's the only way i can describe it
It is SO refreshing to watch someone enjoying food actually, not restricting ❤️✨
Gahhhhh this makes me miss Paris so much.
mel - you look gorgeous! Love your outfit x
So so happy to see the return of Food Diary Fridays!!!!!!!!!! 💖
OmGOD you're acutally such a great vlogger!!! i really enjoyed this one <33 you can film a food diary in Amsterdam lots of love
I loved this so much. I had such stronge waves of wonderlust throughout the entire video. 💛💛
Aaah what a beautiful video! You have me dreaming of travel 💕
This gave me all the feels, Mel! I've dreamed about going to Paris since I was little girl. And yes I can relate as a disney fan I mean are you kidding meee. x
I'm on my period too...😂..you look wonderful and happy😍i love your food vlogs and videos with your family❤💋❤💋❤i think nutella is from switserland
Omg la vie en rose cover by Dodie! ❤ lol I'm sad
I dunno why but I got teary eyed when you were cracking the creme brulee in the Amelie cafe. This video made me so happy and I am also on my period right now.
Melanie, this vlog was so lovely, made me cry ! I'm french and irish, just moved to Dublin but I was born in Paris and there was some serious spillage of tears !! I miss proper feckin bread ;)
I cracked up out loud when you were singing about the French man and his baguette lolol. Also that duck looked PHENOMENAL
I'm so glad you're bringing back the food diaries! They always helped me to be better with what I eat. You should do one if you ever go to Germany! 💚
That was an absolutely INCREDIBLE video💚💚💚💚💚
you look like you lost quite a bit of weight..\nI'm not saying its good or bad\nplease dont be offended..\nJust noticeable
You were so brave trying the snails!\nI would personally never be able to have them x
I love the red dress with the black belt that you got!!
Loved the variety of music choices throughout. :D
So glad you came to Paris! My school is close to Notre Dame and it reminds me of you when I see it everyday now!
Your dad saying fuck off made me laugh. XD Glad you all had a fun time! This made me want to go back to Paris, its so lovely.
Hey, I'm one of your french fan  ! I'm very happy that you liked Paris, it is truly a city full of charm, and it's not on purpose but we are extremely cliché :)
I'm so jealous - Paris looks amazing! Now to watch French Kiss again.
Beautiful video... beautiful music, beautiful city, beautiful food, beautiful girl
Haven't finished the vlog yet but I super hate everyone that lives in Europe right now .... I am so jealous!!!  Of course I say this with all the love in the world because I don't actually mean it ... just miss the fact that I lived in Germany as a kid for a few year whilst my Da was stationed there as an active duty US soldier and now that I'm grown I have NOT had the money to go back... SUPER SUPER SUPER JELLY!!! I want to spend two months in each of my favorite cities!!!
I couldn't eat snails because they are my second favourite animal. I just love how they carry their little home around with them!
These are my favourite videos on your channel! Love you so much and would love to see you film a good diary in Italy x
Such a beautiful video. Who knew a food diary could make me laugh and tear up. The music 🤗
this was such a lovely video, brightened up my stressful day. your personality is gorgeous.
This gave me life 🙏🏻❤️ It looked amazing, all of it!
Hi Mel! In fact, Nutella is Italian! It was invented by Ferrero during the war as a surrogate food, then they improved the recipe and it became the actual Nutella that everyone knows :) Btw I've just ordered your book on Amazon ;)
Nutella was made in Italy :)
It might sound like a back handed compliment, but it is meant as an actual real life comment - I love how you feel totally confident to mention super low-brow sources as the reason you are excited about things or enjoy things (Disney films, Da Vinci code). Its really honest and refreshing. I vote for you to film a food diary in Iceland!
Omg where did you buy the red dress?? It's so beautiful!😍
You look a bit like Amelie in that red dress you bought. Glad you enjoyed the day in Paris. I wish I could go back so much. To add to your francophone music musings look up the artist Zaz. I feel like you'd like her style and would match the soundtrack of this vlog a bit.
NUTELLA is the DELICIOUSESTTTTTT chocolate EVERRRR!!!!!!!1
ugh you're so lovely
Amelie Vibes!!!!
Holland! 👍
omg that playlist is everything ❤️
Ahhh, beautiful France!!
Love dis 👌🏻
Penis Pastry 😂
That red dress 😍
Nutella is German?
Fave videos of yours !!
You're so so lovely 😊
Melanie + Amelie, totally my aesthetic <3
allREDy
Nutella is Italiaaaan!
nutella is actually Italian 😄
NUTELLA IS ITALIAN !!
I think Nutella is Italian 💗
Beautiful video! Paris à travers les yeux d’un étranger! (= Paris through the eyes of a stranger)  But (10:06 that’s not Notre Dame!)  <3
Nutella is German I believe💕💕
Nutella is actually German or Dutch  I can't remember which.
I really don't give a fuck...
Please Alexis or anyone responsible for your channel, if you are reading this, please deactivate the comment section. It's unbelievable  how racist and useless people can be. God bless you and your lovely family.
It's a child. There is no place for hatred here.\n\n\nYou people are disgusting.
Before you go down the comments any further I just want you to know that there's a lot of good white people in this world just like there's good blacks Mexicans and etc don't let these people ruin your image on the white race
Congratulations Serena and Alexis on your bundle of joy.. She is beautiful.. Can't wait to see your wedding
White and blacks can have kids together. What's up with that? It's not wrong
I'm seeing a bunch of comments about racist comments but I'm not seeing any racist comments rn
While playing the videos YouTube is not working\nGive me any suggestions
One question.........Who are these people? (No offense i don't have socail media)
This is such a cute video :)
The white race slowly disappearing....\nGood....goooood....\nAll according to plan
How to ensure your child gets bullied
How could you make a baby with her? I mean, she is famous yes, but ugly af.
Sad little world we live in with such racism.
What a beautiful understated video of your memories, thank you for sharing it is lovely to watch someone as awesome as you and your partner take delight in same simple things every parent does ie dad always takes credit for building cot lol....after the mum has put it on his list and yep we have all practiced swaddling dog/cat at least yours was size appropriate mine was a Lassie sized dog, a bed sheet did the job. I can guarantee you will look at it over years and all emotions will hit you and tears will flow in a good way. Congratulations only advice sleep when baby sleeps and if someone offers to watch/hold her when at home take chance to get bath/shower in peace and it is guests job to make tea/coffee not yours. Enjoy as time will fly past :) x
the vertical video gave me cancer
What is wrong with you guys?! Why would you dislike this
Congratulatiobs guys on your new born baby.
Welcome to this world Alexis! We share the same birthday! ❤️
Why do Italians put they're trash in clear trash bags?\n\n\nSo Puerto Rican's can go window shopping.
most beautiful couple and baby i cry. i cryin
So you call them your name? Really? That's almost a disgrace.
As someone who is mixed I am actually shocked some people in the comments can be this ignorent
Can someone please tell me why this video has so many views?
If she is a feminist...
I'm just gonna watch it again
There is officially more comments saying stop being racist than ones that are racist
This comment section has so much retardation
Category: Science & Technology\n\nWtf has this got to do with science or technology? ...
This isn't my fucking bag Get the fuck out of here
The 4K that disliked this are people who were going to like but accidentally pressed the dislike button and didn't realise
Who are these people, what so good about this vid?
This race mixing will destroy all the races our humanity and at least our own country.
Who are these people
Word of life Las Vegas and the police and a neighborhood of men sex trafficked me
Really people, there's so much video like these and bunch of people saying omg aw this is the best video! And omg best family! Really what the heck, really people.
Another super tennis player is born for sure!!
All you people need to get a life. Like focusing on your lives and not some other celebrity or another athlete that comes and goes.
You should name her Adagio.
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
She's so beautiful! Congratulations!
Man this doesn't help my baby fever at all lmao but I gotta chill
Congratualtions to Serena, Alexis and baby Alexis!! This was way too sweet 💗
Congratulations! I love the crib
Congrats to you both. Have watched Serena and Venus since I was little and inspired me so much. Glad she has found her prince charming...and Alexis is just gorgeous. Many blessings..
your daughter is a mutt
...for fucks sake, a stiff throbbing cock enters a hot moist cunt, then splatters a load of thick sticky cum all over the pussy walls, and you get this...
Anybody who calls their kid ______ _______ Jr. is just a cruel parent in my eyes.
I was wondering why this was trending then I realised, Oh my God, it's Serena Williams!\nCongratulations to the new family ❤️❤️❤️
The one time a Trump comment could be used & it makes sense...The reason this has 4K dislikes is because of racism...on both sides
Who are these people?
I'm a real nigga or nigger lol 😁
Before you people say white racist try to look more into these people if you dig deep enough you will find that a lot of these profiles are in fact black racists or even Asians trying to pretend to be white to frame them.
this is cute and all but why is it on trending that's for actually popular videos
Awwww.......I give this marriage 8 years.
Someone help I can't find the racist comments been scrollin for 5 mins😂
Well..the baby has 2 dads
baby nigger
Awwwwwwwwwwwwww
Wow congrats 🍾 !! So happy 😁
Race mixed

Congratulations beautiful family...many blessings 🙏🙏🙏🙏💖💖💖💖💖
Ew, race mixing.
People who care about skin colour confuse me. Such a pointless thing to care about. It's just such a childish thing.
I'm sick of all these mfkr chimps
He named a girl after him that's weird
Disgusting race mixing
Beautiful
Stop fucking nigger people. We don't need more in this world.
This is fucking beautiful life being created, happiness existing, but why do y'all got to be so damn fucking aggressive damn like is there any actual reason to hate besides the fact that you want attention, or to troll, or because you were raised to see this as wrong, every one dislikes something but there's no need to be aggressive about it and blowing up the comment section doesn't help when the comment you make has been stated fifteen times already
This had thumbnail of reddit...has nothing to do with reddit *DISLIKES*
How is this trending? I thought it was going to be a full mind blown type of video but this dudes evidence is blonde hair? ur a troll (a great one at that)
Did you know every time a joke is uttered on Full House, some poor soul commits suicide?\nIn any case, this theory is just way too out there. Not that I care about the shows at all, I just don't exactly see it.
Wow thats it... really? Leave the theories to Film Theory if youre gonna put out half assed shit like hurr theyre all blonde
So Joey is a homewrecker
Your reaching like a mother fucker 😁😁😁😁😁🤣🤣😁😁😂😁😂😀😊😀😂🤣
Or it's just a fucking show that they hired random actors for and over looked this
They are all my babies because they are white. I'm white, they are white. It all adds up.
I was strawberry blonde as a young child while both of my parents had dark brown hair. My hair turned dark brown as well over time. My paternal grandfather's hair did the same thing.
Is this why Alanis Morrisette was so angry?
the game of thrones reference was funny since one of the twins work on that show
My teacher and his wife are mexican dark skin brown eyes their kid has blonde hair and blue eyes
people who wrote these shows did not put this much thought into them. this is just that tumblr school of reading too much into stuff
I never watched the show but when he said,  Who else is blonde? Instantly I looked at uncle Joey and said,  He's the mother
I am a simple man, if DoB narrates a video  at light-speed pace, I press like.
Wow, what a great argument
dont do this to me please
I have never watched an episode of full house.
Why the Fuck is This stupid shit trending. This is rubbish
My dad has black hair my mom has blond hair but 4 of my 5 siblings are red heads.
They are fucking ACTORS NOT JOEYS KIDS
.....you do know these are actors, right? 💀
Most Caucasians have blonde hair as young children
THIS IS SO DUMB
Comet is blonde. \nDoes that mean...
Wrong, Joey and Danny were a gay couple and it wasn't as excepted back then so they used the girls mother as an incubator for their sperm and Joeys swimmers were faster therefore the three girls ended up being blonde. Then uncle Jesse showed up to help Danny raise the kids and Joey and Danny had to keep their relationship a secret from there on out.
Your parents isn't the only place you get your hair from, even though that's all the show gives you.  Which makes this is kind of silly.  My parents are both brunette, but my brother and I are very blonde, but my other brother and sister have brunette hair.  We don't have different dads, but it runs in the family.  My grandfather on my mothers side was very blonde, and my siblings just inherited my parents/previous generations hair.
It's like a Game Theory episode if it was condensed to 2 minutes.
Or the actors they casted just happened to have blonde hair...
Joey has brown hair. Kids who are going to be brown haired usually are born blonde haired like for example, me. Bye.
1:15 that doesn't mean that it's impossible
Didn't account for the possibility of some of them being fake blondes
Both my parents have brown hair and brown eyes and I'm blonde with blue eyes. I know a lot of people like that. This is a really lazy theory.
Is this a bit? These videos are like an elaborate bit, right?
UNCLE JOEY IS A SICK FREAK! 🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆
My boy joey was getting it in.
Or... they just casted blonde children
It's a freaking comedy tv show
you know they are all actors? not actually related... so genetic hair color is fucking retarded
When was there a second season....
What are the odds of all three children having blonde hair? 12.5%\nWhat are the odds of all three children being female? Who knows.
So he's basically saying that DJ,stephanie,Michelle,and even Nicky and Alex are all secretly joeys WHAT!!!!!!!!!what did I just watch??!!so confused 𗀁𗀋??!!
This is DUMB you think way too damn much it's a fucking show don't put logic into something that has background music playing every time someone makes up from an argument
I can't take this seriously as you refer to him as Uncle Joey.
Not gonna lie this video was not very thoughtful in my opinion.
It makes you think
Did anyone tell you that THIS SHITS ISN'T REAL?
Honestly I definitely do not think Joey is the actual father of Nicky and Alex, you wanna know why I think that... because Jesse would kill him if he did 'do it' with Becky (and I'm pretty sure becky would say something to Jesse about it)
What is more shocking is. 210,429 people watched this stupid useless video.
or or just maybe that they are actors who aren’t actually related to any of each other and they just look like who they look like
I have no idea why people like fuller house
I know this is Cracked, but damn, all 3 kids having blond hair isn't unheard of. All of my kids are blond, and I'm most definitely not. That said, Joey being the father would actually make the show so much better.
I met Joey in real life
Or Danny could have been blonde as a child....
Dear people. Check out my latest video WASTED! in my channel. The video features an hour length dance remix set personally created by myself to keep people up and raise fund. The set is comprised of 16 pop/trance hybrid tracks, and the set will give you both both chill and blast. Please share and like the video! Thank you for your time and support!
This made me fall asleep... 😴
Thank you I always thought that was strange
So the only evidence you have is that they look alike... wow 😂
Uh, call me blind, but Joey's hair looks pretty brown to me.
lol its a SHOW some shows have kids that are darker then their mother & father on there and so on and so forth
So Joey's out to fuck everyone's bitch? This theory was lame
please follow me on ig @bmoreliketae 💙 i follow back .
#2 on trending, insane click bait title with barely any real content or proof... I'm getting out of trending.
what a load of shit
how are they #2 on trending, did they pay youtube with youtube money to be here?
Such a dumb video
Yeah cause Joey was known for being a lady's man 👎🏻😆👎🏻
Ok, first of all, cant the children just look lik their mother, its like a little reminder of how she looks like, I dont know how nicky and alex have blonde hair,OH WAIT,because they're freaking actors and probably better than some of the kids [no offense to the kids who are now adults/late teens who tried out] Second of all\n*How Rude*\nWhat did joey ever do 2 u...........yeah he's blonde.....deal with it😎
Seems legit...
Why is this trending 😂😂😂

Does anyone know who that kid Shawn was talking about?
The most tragic thing after seeing this is that we'll never get to see this actual series/film version. \nIm so fucking sold but this doesnt exist. BLR went from funny to clever to fucking genius. The hard work you put into these is 100% worth it. \nI am giving you a standing ovation right now, typing with my elbows.
only question is.. why did it take you guys this long!!!??? this was amazing hahahaha :)
Wow...it's kinda dead here. 🎵 it just so happens I like to boogie I like to hip hop all day.. 😂
Would actually be a good premise for a movie
I would totally watch this show
I'd watch this
Put the gun down! They call me “Suave” cause I’m really suave…\nLook listen to suave and put the gun down… or else I’m gonna poke ur nuts XD IM DEAD!!
I'd pay like $20 a pop to see this.
I can’t find the real video
Can you make a mean girls video
Oh my gosh I watched narcos. It's so good but please have like some sequel to this just anything
I want this to be a real movie now LOL
Mamma need to hit that
No lie, I would legit watch this show. This was almost heartwarming.
Pablo escobar was never real, and neither was Chapo Guzman just lies
I'd watch the crap out of this show
Best independent film of 2017
Holy shit! I would totally watch the comedy version of this show!
Man if this was a movie I would watch it
The I only date women with little tiny fingers scene was funny af and the momma needa hit that scene were comedy 😂😂😂
omg i wish this was real XD\ni would binge watch this😂
This plot is actually really good
How long was the real Pablo gone?!
Idk anything about the real series but I would totally watch this one. Superb job, BLR!
I'd still watch it
BLR, this is your best one yet. Bravo, my face hurts from laughing!
Momma need to hit that!
Did anyone else liked this as much as I did?
Damn...this got me waaay more emotional than I thought it would.
Absolutely awesome storyline to this. Must be better than the real show. I'd genuinely go and watch this film. Haha
I love this, fits perfectly since I just finished watching Surviving Escobar - Alias JJ, after I finished Narcos.
This would be 10x better if they used normal voices instead of stupid squeeky childish voices. Like, the entire concept is perfect but I feel like this is aimed at eight year olds.
I want to actually watch this version of the show!
I would watch this movie.
Id so watch a series based off of someone trying to pull off being pablos look a like
anyone else recognized the awesome beats from medieval land fun-time world, slightly changed? :D
Press the cork board so the entire manatee is behind the preacher.
I want this to be a real thing.
Just like these days trailers... giving away everything
If you look close Pablo looks like a really overweight Ashton Kutcher. It's really up in the eyes and eyebrows
Wait... So it's not a show about a guy pretending to be poblo? Damn. It look like it would be a fun show to watch. Then I watch the real trailer and it was a real letdown
Make this real please
Someone needs to make this movie lol
You're head's a raisin\n... you're cool... 😂
Who else would actually watch this if this were an actual trailer?
By far the best n smartest shit you guys n girls have EVER done. Hats off to this.🎩
based on a true story
Now I'm just waiting for the song in this to come out in its own separate video
What's with the Volvo ad with the queers before my fucking videos YouTube???
Is  this a funny movie
This would be a pretty good show tbh like I would watch it 😂😂😂
When's the movie coming out?
You know what #BLR people... you could TOTALLY have a disclaimer for us, before watching! How hard is it to say Hey, go pee before you watch! We are not responsible for you laughing so hard you pee your pants. 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
Haven't watched Narcos, but i would totally watch if this setting becomes a proper series.
This would be a great romcom
I'm not crying, you're crying
Wow, the ending was surprisingly heart warming.
Only one who didn't find this funny I guess.
Wish this was real ):
Call me el Guapo. That was an amazing video, definitely one of your best
Did I really just enjoy an 8 minute trailer
You wanna see how low I can talk?
Streets of Rage at 6:05
Because like i dont train myself to starve😂
Do a bad lip reading of The Hobbit/ LOTR movies!
Ay fuck, this actually got me a bit teary eyed at the end... damn these allergies!
If this was the story of Narcos, I would definitely watch it more.
Guy's I need more rubber spider's.
This needs to be a thing. I'm serious. A movie about a man who happens to look like a wanted drug lord sent to gain intel on the drug empire's happenings and incidentally finding himself along the way? I mean, COME! ON!
That was funny af, but sad at the same time
Moon over Parador
The crying
😢
Holy shit is that Oberyn Martell??
Fucking hilarious!
3:43 song got me dying
So good.
Well damn done!
What an emotional rollercoaster. \n\nWell done.
Fuckin Spacebar
Wtf i would watch this lmao

This is gold!
Boo ya, homie

HIJO DE PUTAAAA

MAMA NEED TO HIT DAT
Better than the real thing imo
After watching this I can't take the show serious 😂
This could actually work as a movie
🖤🖤🖤 i wont do glitter but i do like how you showed the simplicity in this. i was falling asleep during the movie and have never seen the original but i do like the clown i mean hes creepy pedophile with a back story they should create but yes loved this and understand why you did it even tho the movie could have been way better. (didnt scare me) ok drunk rant over
Can you do Jason from Friday the 13th
Maybe for halloween 2017 you could do a glam Devil. But loved this look Mykie!! ❤️❤️
I love this. I saw the movie last night and this is amazing
Can you PLEASE do Annabelle doll tutorial
I just got back from seeing this movie and I loved it💜💜💜💜💜
Wait I just realized idk Mykie's full name (if Mykie is short for anything) or her last name
It really creeps me out that i am actually from a town in Ireland called Derry, and its scary af minus the clowns hahaha
You'll probably never see my comment, but I'm doing a demon costume for Halloween and I need makeup ideas. I love your style and I really need help. Can you do a female demon tutorial?
wish me luck, im watching this at night
Where did she get those sharp teeth? I need them in my life
For some reason, I thought the thumbnail was Melanie Martinez or something..
Who know what type of dog Ripley is???
I am here late but extremely excited!
I know it's a little early but I'm already trying to figure out what I'm gonna be for Halloween can you do full costum idea videos please also I love you vids and saw the first one it was awesome

Guys the movie is horrifying and nightmarish and amazing!!! 1000/10 would reccomend

Sleepless nights
Jesus loves you so much and that love he has for you is overwhelming and is like your the only person in all existence that he loves. I'm taking prayer request and if you have questions about God I'm here. I know this video isn't about God but I wrote this in the hope I'll help someone. I'm not trying to push or force my faith on anyone, It's just a friendly offering. Also I have a video called God loves all:message, if your interested. God bless you and have a great rest of your year!:)
I see Pixar\nMy heart fills with happiness
Cool! Just come to the US legally and we will have no problem whatsoever :)
Is this book of life 2? Lol
Also is that an alibreje creature? Awesome just like in Legend quest
I see a strange similarity between this movie and The Book Of Life.
Oh god another musical... Thank god I don't have kids so I won't be forced to watch this.
It has uncanny resemblance with The Book of Life.
Amazing, just amazing. Pixar always does a great job. This ain't an exception.
This film is definitely going to win an oscar next year
Book of life was a good movie. And they know that.
Now Disney will get rich off Mexican culture
damn, disney is really starting to lose it's charm, they're getting more generic and unoriginal by the years
wow I love the book of life
Will they be taking part in the Skeleton War?
What's the name of the song
OMG I'M SO HYPED TO SEE THAT WINGED JAGUAR THING IT LOOKS SO SICK!!!
As a mexican i have to say \nThis is mexican fan service
They keep doing a good job
Basic Ly th same thing as 2015s book of life
THEY EVEN ADDED THE PAN DULCE!!!!!!! I'm excited to see what other not so obvious Latin culture will  be shown.
when bittersweet symphony started playing it got to me lol
Mijo, so thees ees the plot of the entire movie! Bad press made Peexar very nervous, and still thees looks like Book of Life, si?
Oh look it's the book of life
So how will this sit into the pixar theory.
It's a bittersweet symphony
Stop showing the whole movie
So this is Moana, but with music instead of voyaging.
Please make at least one movie with a white character
You have to go back.
I AGREE WITH THE YOUTUBE-LIKERS, I WANT TO SEE THAT MOVIE CALLED: DISNEY PIXAR COCO THE 2017 COMEDY MOVIE TOO!!!!!!!    :-D
Don't mind me. I'm just waiting for The Incredibles 2 trailer to drop. :)
oh look the book of life had a baby
Three words... WHAT A FAGGOT
What song was playing in the background through most of the trailer?
I wish they played the original bittersweet symphony instead of the cover.
Book of life 2 ?  same scene, same theme..  not?
1:46 Something tells me this is gonna be the most disturbing Pixar movie ever.
As a Mexican, I'm really happy they decided to make this!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP01tEMzt40 Meh it'll be hard to top this underappreciated Gem
Trumps gonna ban this movie in the US
I'm so excited Disney is doing a Mexican film!!\nErnesto de La Cruz gave me Jose Alfredo Jimenez Vibes
is this a rip off of the book of life or is it a sequel
Manuel Calavera at 2:03? At least that's what he sounds like...
Oscar for best anime on the way 😇
So is this called Coco or is it Find your voice??
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
Of course this is not going to be better then the mlp movie
the book of life remake by disney
Ordinary kid with specific talent/interest that is forbidden to him. Turns out to be special one who is destined to fulfil desires. Goes to magic world where he learns an important message and manages to find himself before leaving back to his old life, somehow changed.
I'm sorry, but this looks really dumb to me.
Great, basically Book of Life
So  God doesn't exist but a magical skeleton world does? Disney is evil.
This is just the book of life with another characters hahahahahaahahhaaha
Coco was announced to be in the making wayyyy before The Book of Life even released a trailer. You guys saying that this is a rip off movie don't seem to understand just how long Pixar likes to takes to release something. They've been planning this movie for several years.
Think I'd rather watch a wall being built.
Who else remembers running away fron the chancla like usainbolt.                                                       .....those days were rough
this is gonna flop, especially outside americas
This is literally book of life plot in every scene! What the hell pixar!?
I didn't know Marco was getting his own spin off movie
I hope Trump doesn't build a wall around this movie.
Something to take my kids to then.
Ive seen a movie thats pretty similar to this lol
Isn't this like the book of life movie?
...This came out a few years ago... (Well I've seen it*)
How is this being compared to Book of Life? They're completely different films.
This is another version of the movie, The Book Of Life 😂
Seems okay, even if it is a rip-off of Book of Life
Eeeh... doesn't look that good. The plot is predictable and we've seen most of this before. It's not dramatic, it doesn't look that emotional...\n\nI want the old, dark Disney cartoons back.
hell yeah bittersweet symphony by the rolling stones! im watching this for sure. Huge stones fan
So taking a leaf from book of life and kubo. Nice
This is vey dissapointing...took most of the ideas from the book of life
VIVA LATINOAMERICA CARAJO
Big like
1:00
Conan for Life.
So basically poco from brawl stars 😂
But why?
this looks great
lol la chancla
The abuelita whipping around  chanclas like nunchucks is my fave part.
I love Coco
2004: NO CAPES\n2017: NO MUSIC
That esculated quickly
This looks good
grim fandango the movie?
This looks wonderful
Nice video :)
Awesome trailer
Trump will tweet about this
Dang beaners
bitter sweet symphony? oh boy
Another Gotta get home story. Yayyyyyyyyy
sans undertale
Official us lmao
F**cking Creepy.
Still trending...
Book of Life
Undertale the movie looks good.
Soy mexicana y esta película me emociona. Qué bueno que Pixar abarque otras culturas y, por lo que sé, hay una profunda investigación de sus realizadores respecto a la tradición, incluso estuvieron en época de día de muertos en varios lugares de México para contrastar las diversas maneras que celebramos esta fecha. Ya en el trailer se ve que es una belleza. Viva México y latinoamerica. <3
What the fuck I just watched
Title of the song is White Mustang, but she gets into a Studebaker Avanti? Wtf kinda shit is this, and how did I get here to this shitty music?
Everyone is ignoring the fact that there is not a single white mustang in this video LMFAO there are 2 white cars but neither are mustangs 😂😂
If they don't stop those out of season firestorms, it will be just that.
Introduced my husband and my niece to Lana circa 'Born to Die' and now we all ride out to her every album she drops💛
Is that Richard Branson
Her music always makes me rethink my life.
My girlfriend is obssesed with her makes me listen to this bullshit lmfao.
Mustang is a name of mythical place in Nepal. It's a dry desserts & the weather there is always cold & windy. I got so shocked that Lana named her song White Mustang because I'm a die hard fan of Lana from Nepal. Lots of love & warm wishes from Nepal. 💞
I miss when her music video boyfriends didn't look like they are missing a chromosome :(
I LOVE THAT HOUSE
I'm just looking for the white mustang.
I am obsessed with the whistling part
That song would fit for a car advertising mostly for a Mustang car! 😂😂😂
she's so different now, i can't understand!
That dude looks like a young Richard Branson
My friend hate lana and her music . Idk why tho
This is a rip-off from Patrick Watson's Love Songs for Robots...
if you focus on the details... probably this house is the same one that appears in one video that she posted on instagram singing Stargirl hmm
When I listen to this song at first I was delighted. But I have to say a thing. Lana.  You are a great singer. Probably you are the most qualified singer at the moment. Your songs give an incredible vibe. Your music and art are one of the Best. But you will never get the level of RIDE. RIDE was the Best. This song is very good.... But... Lana the video does not deserve it.
I just came in my pants
Don't get it but love it
this looks like the continuation of high by the beach
I'm still waiting for born to die Lana to come back 😭😩
No white mustang. Oh the irony.
there's no mustang in the video, Lana is singing about his dick. :)
Didn't think they picked the best actor for the male role. But I still love Lana.
Check out my girl Camila's new single Love!! ❤️👉🏼👉🏼 https://youtu.be/MtBFu2JgxxE

shoutout to Lana for choosing to have Demo from the Icelandic band Steed Lord to play her love interest in this video!! 🖤
I loved her new era, Lust for Life. I feel somehow new vibes, she's kind of maturing, besides we have three perfect songs (God Bless America and All The Beautiful Woman In It, Tomorrow Never Came and Beautiful People with Beautiful problems)

No crowd joke anywhere? Really? And mustang is in the title??!!!!
Just listening to a few seconds of the song I loved <3
This could be a great/suitable music for the fifty shades trilogy m/v ...it's so seductive
Blessed to live in the same time as Lana Del Rey ❤😭
When God made lana, he spilled the whole bottle of voice in her and dropped the whole box of vintage effects dust on her.
Generally boring record and it is natural she picks the most boring song off of it. Boring video to go with it. Yawn.
1. If you thought he was lying dead on floor at beginning: Wrong\n2. If you thought there may be a car crash in middle of video: Wrong\n3. If you thought it would end with same melody as it started: Wrong\nShe's the best nonetheless
Don't say you love music if you only listen to rap
Hello Lana fans, I just wanted to say that I do song covers on my channel, in case you're interested…Sorry for the self-promotion, when you're a small channel it's pretty hard getting your content out there…I have done a cover of Born to Die, just not sure whether to upload it or not. I'll try working on it a bit more...Thank you from Italy :) <3
LANA, DO A VIDEO FOR CHERRY PLEASE!!!
She pretty💯💯💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍like if you agree
i'm stuck on put me in a movie, smarty, be my daddy, yayo and now this

Nice song and Music 🎧🎶😍😊

lyrics don't go with the beat e.e it's horrible
YES
lana's finally back with hipsters 😍
Are we gonna ignore the fact she has natural nails now im shook
Is this like the Chinese bootleg of white Ferrari?
I don't get the point of the video. Ultra violence was my last favorite album from her.
No mueras, nunca <333
I was such a fool for believing
Ew why she with a crusty hippie headass
This song and video is ICONIC!! Its so beautiful. The cinematography is amazing. And you look amazing standing strong at the end ❤️

So Get free' plays during the rocket going off and then I get a groupie love vibe with the guys flash back with while driving? anyone else?
😍
💗💗💗💗
shut up about BAR and enjoy the video for what it is.
Lana 💗
Get Free next single
This album makes me feel alive.
How dare you attack me like this
This video sucks
my body hurts too. u can tell by my picture
How can you guys not have had Snoop Dogg yet?
Techno fans are the most useless people on Earth, seconded only by DJs.
Nice work, man. Can you get In Flames on this show?
Y'all need to get Patrick Rothfuss, really interesting cat!
BUT BUT BUT! you havent made something like without you... ?
Love the Sox jersey. South side Hitmen
Get Gordon Ramsay on the show please
What was the name of the artist Dillion mentions at 9:51? I wanna check this music video out.
Does this show just make you want to eat those wings
Get Fifty Cent to do the show
Actually, body scanner app works very cleverly. Take a picture from a person in front of you. \nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appgametechnologies.bodyscannerrealcameraclothscannerprank2017&hl=en
This nigga look like he work at Buzzfeed
Asking Dillon Francis if Dj Pauly D or Paris Hilton is best is a fucking brilliant move.
do one with Tyler the, creator\nplease
WHEN THE FUCK WILL THAT LAST DAB NOT BE PENDING? HUH? MAYBE IT'S NOT THAT HOT
When will Seth Macfarlene or Chris hardwick or rob dyrdek ever get on the show.
Lol,...it's the best show on YouTube..(Sean slams his drink down, makes a face like c'mon maaaan)
I swear Cher is a guy. Has to be!
Dillon Francis finishes in his pants @17:00
Don't know this guy but looking him up after this.  Seems chill
Cool dude, but not a great DJ.
I feel like someone gave Sean a bottle of Blair's Mega Death, and he hates being wasteful.  This show is just a front to get people to help him finish the bottle so he doesn't have to eat all of it himself.
Never heard of. Never will.
The  gesaffelstein music video he mentions at 9:52 is https://youtu.be/oRSijEW_cDM
Yay they have crystal hot sauce. That's the best tasting one.
Tommy Wiseau\n\n(would be fitting with Disaster Artist coming up)
the reds in this episode are blowing out the camera kinda like jerry's sweatpants in the first episode of Seinfeld.
Good grief I love this human! Dilly you're the best
I don't follow EDM at all, had no idea who Dillion Francis was but this was one of my favorite episodes so far, super personable and entertaining guy. He's right btw, best show on youtube.
Y'all add me on sc melvinhtx713 pls
8:03\n\n\nRick Sanchez is right next to Dillon's left thumb, making a cameo appearance on Hot Ones.\ncool sauce.
Look around lol. Most have already adopted a no fucks given attitude. Apathy and greed have spread like cancer.
WHOA! Sean finally didn't say Very aggressive brand name when it came time for Dirty Dick's
Yo try to get some bodybuilders or strongmen on this sheeet
Love your show...some of the best questions in the game. You should make a montage of the number of times guests say great question. Ran across this & thought y'all might find it interesting. Continued success to you. http://www.okayafrica.com/culture-2/african-sauce-stew/
I'd love to see an uncut version of this
Yo I love how relaxed Sean was in this interview :)
I don't know how much favor this would get.. But you should get the 1993, 1994 Blockbuster Videogame Champion DrDisrespect.. The speed, momentum and violence those wings would get would be invigorating.
Guilty of putting a few drops of Blair's on my sandwich
Dave Grohl has an album to promote... just saying...
Ayyyyy that Yung pinch shout! Get Richard Christy on from Stern show
T Y L E R C R E A T O R and B I L L  B U R R
Who is that vlogger Dillion was talking about at 9:50
Loved him as a guest.
Seeing Watsky on the show would be cool.
Sean and Dillon Francis finna be real life homies after this. I could tell this was the kindling of a bromance
Black coffee always helps when my mouth is on fire. Seriously.
The last dab is disappointing :(
Please get vic mensa on. It needs to happen
I am one of the weirdos eating hot sauce every day. I make my own from naga vipers. Yum.
You guys gotta get Simon Cowell on! I doubt he will agree to, but it would be freaking amazing if he did!
Get Tyler the creator or diplo
week after week every new episode is trending but sub numbers still around 1.6M.  What gives?
ugh i love dillon francis. ever since i first saw him live at Voyeur in San Diego almost a decade ago i knew this guy would be hilariously amazing throughout his career
Way to rep the Sox Sean.
there is no old Dillon Francis. His music is still🔥
Hold up, the police really took a shit on the bus? That's hilarious.
why haven't you had joe rogan on here yet?!?!?!?!
I feel like a lot of famous people are starting to look like messi
very surprised!!! he handled them probaly the best!! in the top 5 forsure!!
there was  too much red on this lol
There's a censored and uncensored version of Gessafelstein's Pursuit video, and put together they have under two million views. Shameful. \nAlso, why'd he call it a vlog?
HEY LIT VIDEO FEAST\nWE JUST DROPPED A LIT VLOG WHERE WE HAD A REALLY FUNNY PILLOW FIGHT! IF YOU GUYS CAN SHOW IT SOME LOVE THAT WOULD BE AWESOME TY:)
Been noticing more and more : can we tone down the sound effects? They've been becoming more overt and distracting.
Love dillonF
My man! 👏🏼👏🏼
#milkandhotsauceSodomy....!!! Nuff said....
Xavier Woods a/k/a Austin Creed.\n\n https://youtu.be/Bgv881gtSb0\n\n https://youtu.be/Lwyv1omJzLI

Bakerxderek!!!
Who are these people??? Can we get guests we know please? Martin Garrix, Vince Staples, Dj Snakes and this random dude now??? Never heard of those guys and I'm the same age as you Sean! I know you're trying to appeal to the young internet audience but we're here too man!\nOr at least get some  funny people. Get Bill Burr!!!
I don't even know who the fuck this guy is. Sean you need to get sum more relevant people on your show man.
EDM sucks... America ruined all electronic music... It's sold out and shit now... Thanks for ruining my culture America...
who is this guy?
I would totally eat that fcking pastry...
Nick Jonas is so fucking hot. I want him to massage my ass...with his dick.
Shawn is a lucky man
The reason he's so damn buff is probably because he played an MMA fighter in the TV show Kingdom. He's seriously ripped in the show. Its actually a decent show-turns out the kid can act and very well actually. Unfortunately it only has 3 seasons but its still worth watching.
He's so hot ugh
Is it me it or does his voice sound different?
LET ME DO THE THING nick jonas babe, I let you do whatever you want to me.
The only guy that i think is the most humble person ever.
People, stop commenting perverted things. You guys are so nasty. 😣😣
between 1d and nick jonas james is living every girl's dream. \nmaybe not every girl but sure as hell mine!
I think I need a massage too…… where's my NICK JONAS?
The way the shirt wrapped around Nicks muscles...  Oh child 🙌
IF NICK JONAS GAVE ME TAT PASTERY I WILL LOVE TO EAT IT HAHAHAH
I wish Nick would rub me like that 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Being a host is such a great job
don't skip leg day kids
He is just air and water. Withour shirt he have any muscle
I've never been more jealous of James as I an right now
i want him do the thing for me too
He can do the thing with me.
This wasn't something I ever asked for but am weirdly content with having
DAMN!!!! When did Nick get so duff???

ممكن تشتركو في قناتي بحبكم
Stop normalizing these liars and crooks.  Spicer stood in front of the world at had no problem lying through his teeth.  The damage they are doing is real.  Normalizing deplorable behavior is how Trump got elected.
Trump is such a blatant liar. I don't know how Spicer can sleep at night.
Poor spicey  I have so much more respect for him now. I bet he's so relieved he out of there now!!
He was only in that position for a matter of weeks. Why are some acting like he had been in it for years? 😂😂😂
We all have free will...in the end.  Spicer sold his soul and is now trying to play the sympathy card.  You chose your path, Spicy.
It's good to see Sean Spicer smiling. I'm a democrat, but man I felt bad for him while he worked for Trump.
Suddenly alternative facts doesn't sound like an oxymoron because it's a matter of how you interpret something.
IM NOT AN REPUBLICAN OR CONSTERVIE BUT I THINK SEAN SPICER HAD THE WORST JOB EVER THANK FOR SERVING COUNRTY
Sean is very diplomatic but he's still full of sh.....t!
Facts are facts and aren't up for opinion or perspective. A blue sky is a blue sky. Saying it's red because that's your perspective means you're color blind, or just  lying.
Feel bad for him
wait what ? so american WH speaker is a position to lie in behalf of the president ?i though he represented the nation........no wonder america is like that
Spiceman is still full of SH!T!
Man, i feel sorry for him.. He seems like nice guy if you look at him now
Would I have love to be a fly on that wall watching Donald Trump correct Sean Spicer on how to articulate a sentence
He is such a pleasant guy! Never knew he had such great smile. We should love one another, beyond politics!
Poor sean.... he had to do what he got to do to keep his job.  Now he's like a floating cloud ☁️ never seen him smile that much, what a change!
At least he can laugh at himself.
WOW! Melissa McCarthy really let herself go. Is she pregnant?
😂😂😂😂 I kinda feel sorry for this cracker
Jimmy Kimmel is an idiot.  His bias is showing. Yes we all know he is an anti-Trump.
I think Melissa Mcarthy weirdly made him more likable. I need to occasionally remind myself the difference between the two 😂
some people feel bad for this guy and other people who resigned or was fired  from the administration, but honestly imagine how little dignity one would have to have to work for the Trump Administration.
Jajajaja jajajaja!!!!! He looks much better he's off the job
Love spicers upbeat attitude on the situation but that interview said alot about trumps crazy ways
I always knew Spicer was a good guy, he is free from the grasp of the devil now.
That frame rate though.
jimmy was just roasting him lol
No shame
He talks and laughs like Guiemo
This is funny and all but I still dislike the SOB
Before long, everyone Trump fires is going to appear on tv or write tell all books. So much tea is about to be spilled. 🐸☕️
Melissa McCarthy is getting good with her makeup?
It’s not a hard job, why do people keep saying this about the job when Spicer was the PS?\n\nAll you have to do is answer questions to the best of your ability and remain calm.\n\nSpicer did not know how to do either and made the job look incredibly hard.\n\nI don’t like the new PSD either but she’s doing a professional job and doesn’t make the job look hard.\n\nHe was just AWFUL at his job.
He had the job of trying to tell the world about trumps bullshit, every conference must have been terrifying
Heh. Give the guy credit; he's got balls for coming on that show, and for just doing such a difficult job.
Opinion: Spicer took the job as he's always wanted to be in the white house however he would never make it under a real president and he knew it plus the $$$ trump would funnel him
So it's ok to flat out lie to the country if Trump says so.🤦🏽‍♀️
There's a lot of us who wanted to be focused on his agenda...  but Trump's focus is always on size.
And did anyone notice when he said WERE (friends in the press) and somebody in the crowd audibly went 'ahhhww'
He started out pretty decent, but then he basically admitted lying was okay. :/
a liar to the very end i see
Thanks Sean for your service.\n\n\n\n\n\nSAID NO ONE EVERRRREE
... smallest audience I've ever seen on Kimmel and Spicer's spine is the newest flavor of gelato at 7/11... No joke. Just kidding. Joke.
My man Spicy! But where's your neck bro?
Kimmel is such a tool.
Spicer was very professional in this interview.
his shame will never leave him
His friend asks him, Are you going to be telling the truth while you're at that podium.....    The entire time he's saying he will be, he's subtly shaking his head.....  lol.
For the rest of his life, he'll only be a joke.
oh no he did not win the Election...no no no!!
Most of us feel a great sympathy for Sean Spicer. He did a great job under quite hopeless conditions.
He´s the president, so he´s allowed to lie.
The fact he got roasted as his intro... wow lol
I was hopeful at the beginning of this interview that we'd see the real Spicer but It's like the truth is still being held hostage inside Sean's body, and  it's desperately banging on the doors for help.
I want him in SNL
I think he is a good guy and loyal to his boss. He is just doing his job. And no i'm not a Trump supporter. My jaw dropped as well when Spicey announced the inauguration crowd size and end it with 'period'.
I'm a progressive but I appreciate Spicer's service.  It's my understanding that he's also a military reservist. Thank you Sean for your service.
Damn he is actually a fun person
He looks more human now.
Never seen Spicy smile before. Working for Trump can't make smiling easy.
jimmy shouldve had him WITH melissa mccarthy.
Spicer seems so nervous. He's like not breathing properly. It's the same way he talks when he's being grilled by reporters. Kinda feel bad for the guy.
This guy is a good sport.
When he first walked out I honestly thought it was Melissa McCarthy as spicer
Why do I like him?
disagree on facts not possible ? \nDonald trump is president \ndemarcates say not my president .\nI guess we can disagree on facts
it was a huge deal for trumos fragile ego
Things just got a little more Spicy
He's so obviously trying so hard not to say anything that could piss Trump off.
This guy is a Damn Rock Star
He looks like the T-1000
I wish he gave a straight answer about the crowed seize, he's still loyal to the president!
he is still a slimy, lying traitor in my book.
it's always strange to me how much the left hates on this man, and then they completely turn it around and say he was just doing his job lol.
He really does look like Melissa.
Spicer is still in the NAvy.  i think that is why he is thanked for his service.  whether he knows it or not.
We have so many problems, They worry about Dreamers stealing jobs from black young people. Why would black inner city gang members making a mint selling drugs inside ransacked US cities take a McDonald's job? They are holding whole cities hostage and your worried about some honest hard working people working and paying taxes? We need good people not thugs and that's is what we have even before DACA was ever thought of. I'll vote to keep the Mexicans and bring even more diversity through a legal program set up by Congress. That way a few people can come who couldn't afford it. We get better citizens and cities rejuvenated and they get to try a free country on for size. Win win for all. Go President Trump, Go Republicans, Go Democrats, and God bless the Dreamers.
This was his chance to shine and redeem himself, but I think he wasted the opportunity.
Who else expected Melissa McCarthy to appear when Jimmy said hear's sean spicer.
This whole interview, Kimmy Kimmel was trying to get Sean to admit that he was wrong or that the President has lied. Sean was having none of this, and every turn was defensive.
This video explains a lot, especially why a lots of republicans seem to deviate from reality.
I just wanna like this guy
ugh Jesus Christ Jimmy why are you giving this guy a platform........ did we not learn anything from the election
Spicers exact words that day were that it was the largest audience to witness an inauguration in person AND around the globe. A worldwide audience, yet Kimmel concentrates on a photo taken earlier in the day to deflect from this fact.
Trump got elected off the back of people's distrust of lying politicians... Then Spicer helps him create an environment where nobody can take seriously any statement the White House issues. Other people can think this guy's a loveable buffoon if they want
It's like he's just been evicted from the big brother house
🐸SEAN HAS A MESSAGE FOR ALL THE WH REPORTERS.┌∩┐ (◣◢)┌∩┐\nP.S. THE INAUGURATION HAD THE BIGGEST AUDIENCE OF ANY AS WAS THE STATEMENT. NOT NECESSARILY JUST THE CROWD IN ATTENDANCE. THE *ENTIRE* AUDIENCE. THOSE BS SIDE BY SIDE STILLS COMPARING THE CROWDS OF HIS AND OBAMAS WERE TAKEN AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE DAY. OBAMAS WAS AT THE START OF THE SHOW AND TRUMPS WAS HOURS BEFORE. FLAKE NUDES AGAIN.
Welcome to #LosAngeles Sean Spicer- Thank You for your service,.
Just another REPUBLI-CON DICKHEAD!
Poor guy
Sensitive key hand cold dramatically hers female plot directly pride.
U hung in there..well done spicy
Thats a tight suit
This is scary.
Es mas bueno!!  😄
Can we disagree with the facts? Says the liberal. Jesus that's ironic.
Wow Jimmy getting all worked up and upset about Trump made me cringe so bad. How can a guy who starred on The man show be so sensitive. I guess he is so close to getting cancelled he has to be a PC zombie or he will be replaced by someone who will.
7:39 His job is to articulate the president's position. Because the president isn't very articulate, right?
Spicer for president 2020!
I love how many troll comments Sam gets. They're obsessed with her. She's obviously doing a great job.
I wonder how diverse Samantha's neighborhood is?
...So out of touch. ...So smug and self-satisfied... *_I don't understand why Hillary lost_*
The Nazis of the past were definitely a threat. The Nazis of today, not so much.. They can't even bring proper torches out for a mob, which says a lot about how defanged they are.\n\nThat being said, punching them isn't gonna accomplish nothing. Remember the words of Dr. King Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that. For all of you advocating for punching Nazis, I a black man ask you this, has that made less riots and civil disturbances occur less across the nation? Have you truly succeed?
The left IS racist AND fascist. They think other races NEED white people to SAVE them and want to control them to submit like pets. The left is racist and fascist!
You have a nasty attitude. I can't wait until you ruin your own career. \n\nAnd Trump WON!!!!!
love cannot exist without hate and hate cannot exist without love
Don't you have some cancer patient to mock?
samanthabee.com/lifeafterhate  - link at the end of the episode.
Just had a terrorist attack, but WHITE SUPWEMACISTSSTST!
Am I supposed to give her my movie ticket?
I'm glad to see a beautiful African american woman fight white supremacy
I'm sure the 1k dislikes didn't watch the show😐\n #LifeAfterHate 😁
most of the facts she pulls from are just provably wrong so I cant even begin to criticize the points shes making
troubled waif......a worrying woman's woman.
Meanwhile in Europe...
unfunny
She has awesome hand movements.
#Hillaryforprison
Great interviews Sam.
You are intellectually dishonest
But where are these terrorists attacks? Where are the reports? Deaths? Injuries? There are constant reports of attacks from leftwing radicals, constant reports of attacks from radical islamists, constant reports of attacks in places like the Philippines from religious radicals.
Samantha i pray everyday that you get cancer
What an evil hag. Why does she get a show?
I support the goals of Life After Hate, but the white guilt in this video is kind of nauseating.
that's insane they gutted funding wow
The propaganda is real.
Genuinely curious if Samantha has done a show on brown nationalism or Islamic supremacy? If one attack in America killing a white person can spark this kind of content then hundreds of attacks by one group, there has to be at least one video. If there is let me know I'd love to watch it and see if I can donate to ending hate towards whites.
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
1k dislikes?.. Keep going with this stuff Sam clearly we still have a problem..
Yeah I too dislike those terrorists that dress all black and destroy Berkley... oh wait
The dreamers & Medicare for all please watch https://youtu.be/XRnOdnWtQbc
I would love to meet former white supremacists. I mean that very genuinely. I just want to sit and have a conversation.
Why won't she ever bring up statistics in her propaganda ? Come on Samantha you are on the right side of history. Just talk about the statistics lol. \n\n\n\n\nOh wait. She literally can't.
Lack of love distorts people, and love is the cure for all evil.
I love all the links to the studys shes getting all of the numbers from
Hey it's not racist if your black and hate white people, it's only white people who are even capable of racism.\n\nHerrrrrr durrrrr...
What about the terrorists on the left beating people and damaging property.
Nice! Now call out the BLM supramicists and Communist Antifa...oh wait..
It's embarrassing that YouTube puts this as trending with barely 200k views.
There are black racists, BLM, and white racists, Neos, and brown racists, La Raza.  There will be hate groups...best to join Christians United and promote love.
Hate towards cancer patients 🤔
Oy vey goyim support non-whites  and have  multiracial children.
Useful stuff. \nHonestly I've got mixed feelings on the issue, I think groups like Life After Hate are incredibly useful and important and good. \nAt the same time, plenty of bigots are incredibly violent and dangerous and many have gotten into positions of power and will use that to hurt people, so people do, I feel, have to be willing to rebel or fight back against violence and injustice as well. \nThere's no single perfect solution sadly.
I'll stop punching nazis when they stop threatening me with death.
The terror statistic is BS
Guess Samantha's never heard of black power/black terrorists. Heck they with 13%+ of the population, they sure do like committing half the crime that goes on around here. Seen enough didn't do nuffings CCTV's to convince me otherwise either.
This is the 1000th comment!! :-)
Wait, you all caught that part about Trump eliminating the funding for anti-hate groups like this, right?
Deport the nazis to europe ~ 😛
So this actual passes for comedy now days?
But how does the hug disengage them from the Nazis? Like... If they stay Nazis to get hugs...
join interracially against racism on facebook
Sam is so awesome
I really hate this woman... white pride is fabricated... I'm white and know white people and don't hear anything about racist thoughts...the terrorists are the left fuckwads that attack people randomly
What's wrong with you people? All Samantha spews is hate!
Choke on a bowl of dicks.
Hahahahahahaha \nFakenews \nAmericans are not nearly as racist as we are portrayed by fakenews.
Classic racist garbage. Thanks for nothin Samantha Bee. Talk about both sides. AKA BLM. -I hate white supremacists, I hate black supremacists.
Talking about brainwashed america liberals have destroyed this world
I think we can all agree that Oregon is a terrible place where you can't even pump your own gas.
🏳☮🏳 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLQ_h2kdt0U    PEACE SONG PROJECT, YOU ALSO WATCH AND SHARE, DO SOMETHİNG FOR PEACE... 🏳☮🏳
I'm proud to be white.
Of course YouTube trends more leftist propaganda, you're not even trying anymore Sam, you're just making entire segments out of Salon and HuffPost articles, but your viewers have such cognitive dissonance they don't even care! They're worse than 45 supporters.
Dislike. Have a nice day. :)
white people created this problem, and its our job to fix it.... I'm sorry fellow white person, but i didn't create any problem that you scream in your pillow every night, and it's not my job to fix your motive.
🗣🗣 *Would you call Dylan roof a terrorist? *
What right wing terrorism cases? All this video covers is two case studies.
Black pride? Awesome! Fantastic! Great to see that kind of empowerment!\n\nWhite pride? Despicable! Hateful! These people are literally murderous nazis!
Uncle Sam sure did change hitlers opinion about being superior.
i saw the title about domestic terrorists and was like finally a video about antifa/blm domestic terror. but no, it's still fake news.
*SO HAPPY* to have you back, Samantha B! I have missed you!
I love the tip of the hat to Mel Brooks
*The road to Auschwitz was built by hate, but paved with indifference.*\n\nIndifference of centrists such as Samantha.
LOVE!
Samantha Bee for president!
Pure propaganda. Sad faggots who watch this
Marxist authoritarian trash.
Those pesky christians blowing people up
Yet Soros funded haters cannot let go.
More Alt-Left propaganda... 👎🏿
Thanks Full Frontal with Samantha Bee.:)
Smug Liberal Alert
Wuv, trew wuv, is what bwings us togever today.
Pride is a sin. #PurplePower.
*THIS IS ALT-LEFT PROPAGANDA*
The title should be changed to Life after Modern-Day Liberals. It's essentially the same thing.
Samantha, now do you see why Trump is POTUS?\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFUIVfKTeVg&list=PLrEnWoR732-BHrPp_Pm8_VleD68f9s14-&index=1
Daily remember that blacks commit over 50% crimes, being only 13% of population.\n\nBut that's not terrorism.
It is Antifa that's instigating violence across America. That is what the statistics say. So why is this disinformation here?
I wish BLM supporters would start coming out of the hate closet too.
White supremacy isn't a problem here in America and if you think it is you're lagging behind the rest of us
You know how to not solve the problem people? By alienating white males... It's not like they are the one group you need to be working with to come together. It's only going to fuel more racism but keep it up guys let's drag everyone back 60 years to make yourselves feel better about Trump being president. We need to stop awarding people for playing victim or else why would anyone want to change (Hollywood).
Youtuber trying to reach 13k subscribers. I make natural hair/fashion videos and would love if anyone subscribed if they like what they see ❤️❤️❤️
I wish Samantha would get lost and stumble onto a busy freeway 👍🏽
You know if someone wold say the mojordy of the tarist are black it's racist then if you say the same about white people it's not then oh wait that means ur still racist to White people wich we come to the hidden Truth this Sam is racist.
Samantha bee is a humorless hack fraud.
Pity the website doesn't accept donations using non-US credit cards :( Any way to change that?
When are you going to condemn the left wing fascist group known as ANTIFA Samantha? 🤔🤔🤔
About as funny as leukemia.

This song is so good!! 😍
I've loved this song and album since it came out but I don't really understand this music video..
Niggas switch up just to be top 10 on billboard charts hmm....Be yourself bro you'll get there.
Its time for your label to drop some more serious marketing money on this song.
So lame and gay what a retard
OMG I love this song I just heard bit for the first time today and I've already listened to it about 1000 times (more likely 100 times) I can't stop listening to it I also realized it is way different from your rap songs. But yeah I think that this might be my new favorite song, not just by you, but my favorite out of every song I like...
This song is genius
everyone e in the comments saying he sounds like someone else, no he's making his own music with his style. if he wanted to copy someone he'd do a cover or something
Fuck what anyone says, this song is great.
I love this song

Always reliable reviews! Thanks Fleur! That lip gloss looks amazing.
LOVED the casual setup! :)
Love your videos 😘
love it
You are my favorite You Tuber!!! ❤️❤️❤️🤗🤗
Love your nail color
£6&10 p&p !!!
You look stunning!!! Natural beauty+pregnancy glow= beyond words beauty! Fleur you look lovely, and by far the best/most honest reviwe I've seen so far! Lots of love! Xx Tatty
Hi Fleur do you think the Fenty primer is better then the Two Faced Hangover one?
I love this sort of video! You're so gorgeous but I must say, I'm still not excited by this brand. It seems expensive but cheap...
I always trust your reviews... I tried the gloss on my hand at Sephora , the smell is amazing! It's so pretty.
This is my favourite video of yours in ages. It was a really professional review, IMO. I really like how you gave candid first impressions of the good and bad of each product, whether or not you ended up liking or disliking them. I feel like it was really honest and helpful! I agree with the others, as well: I'm not sure if you've changed your lighting or hair colour, but you're looking extra stunning in yourself here, too. Keep it up!
I'm not camera ready......looks flippin gorgeous!
Loved the video!!
That estee lauder cushion foundation looks amazing. I need that Fenty primer!!! I love your makeup reviews Fleur <3
dont think u knew how to pull the blotting paper out because ive seen others do it just fine ..
Where are your dungarees from? x
Loved this video. Loved how long it was and informal. Just chilling it with a friend style.
you literally have a holiday glow with this ! <3
Great video! The casual vibe, the fact that you paid for the products, watching you apply it like in the old days, all of it! Loved it!
Honestly i loved this style of video!
I don't know if this is true but I have heard that the foundation oxidises to a few shades darker x
Hey Fleur! There have been too many beauty videos lately... At least for me... How about some bags? Shoes? Thanks!
Really love this review, very genuine.....more less planned videos in the future 👍👌
Your pregnancy really suits you! You're stunning! <3
Great video, I fully expected to hear you hating the products because I tend to associate you with higher end brands and products. I really love that you got excited as a consumer and I agree that your video seems to be the most unbiased so far! Love the laid back feel too! Xx
The blotting paper looks like rizla skins and a rolling machine for joints 😂😂😂😂
1) your excitement is contagious, 2) your make up afterwards looks BEAUT, 3) girl, that t-shirt and dungarees are a LOOK
great review. really thorough and well-explained. your word choice is so specific and accurate. keep it up!
I really liked this old style video with a classic review and try on. Looks great and now I would love to go out and pick up that lipgloss! :)
I realize this video was a little on the spontaneous side; that being said, I REALLY enjoyed it. It felt very authentic and had a nice, relaxing vibe. This video was a great example of how you don't need to go all out to make quality content. If the enthusiasm is there, the rest will follow. \nOn a slightly unrelated note, I don't know what it is about this particular video, but you really looked like Hannah in some parts of it. I've never really thought that before. Obviously, I've noticed the familial similarities, but I've never looked at the both of you together and thought, twin moment. For the record, that was meant to be a compliment. You both are beautiful gals!
Really love this style of video, Fleur! Please do more first impression/live haul type videos. xx
Loved this video Fleur! I find that I prefer videos like this (you called it raw). I like it without a studio or studio lighting etc. It feels more natural and less produced and therefore more real. I hope more youtubers go back to this style of video. I want to feel like a friend is telling me about products, not selling me some on HSN. Great job and you look fab!
Fleur, do you still have the London apartment?
LOVE this style of video! You're glowing and look absolutely stunning!!!
I don't think I'm going to indulge in this line myself, but it does look lovely. And I loved the more relaxed, hands-on review style -- both informative and casual, like a (circumstantially one-sided) conversation with a friend!
Might have to get the lip gloss!!
What's your nail color? It's so pretty!
Love this - you should do more first impression videos!
Totally random, but what colour / brand nail polish are you wearing??? Its gorgeous!! x
please do more first impressions just like this! casual, honest, no big production required, just a good solid chat... loved it!
Your skin looks incredible!! Please please do a cushion foundation best and worst! X
The contour colour looks amazing on you!
I'm glad u gave it a good review! I wasn't hyped about the line either BUT once I found out what was in the range, my interest was peaked! I only purchased the lippie and primer. They were out of my foundation and I can't buy anymore highlighters until I've used up what I have. Seriously, how many do u actually need?!?! Ultimately, I'm pleased to see that u liked it bcuz as a black woman, the range of foundations for us is  UNHEARD OF. We still don't have a STRONG market catering to us and our beauty with ALL its many shades. So, I think THAT is really what the hype was about. Black women/girls felt like, FINALLY, someone thought exclusively about US! It's not so much about Riyanna (did I spell that right?) and if my Caucasian, and Asian sisters don't understand that, then you've missed the whole point. #bravo Fleur!
Loved the style of this vid xx
I feel like you match exactly my colouring! Hope you get to try the foundation in the right shade one day
Loved the style of this video, very natural X x
Tear the blotting paper against the blade from one side to the other instead of ripping it :)
Love this video Fleur! So different for you, in a good way 😊 you also look absolutely beautiful! X
Are you going to get a foundation that matches for a second review?
Oh my goodness I love love loved this video! I enjoyed the more relaxed vibe you had going on and you are looking so beautiful. Love to you, Mike & all your fur children! Xx
I hope your read this, but I'm in love with your tragus piercing. Would you mind sharing where you got it? It's so cute!
Your skin looks amazing 😍 pregnancy is really working for you! Are you going to try another shade of foundation? Would be good to hear your opinion of your shade, also love the casualness to the video xxx
I wish you used the white because I haven't seen a review with it yet
very nice video, good review :)
your skin looks amazing in this Fleur! <3
You should never buy makeup online , you should always try it first on your face (physically go to the shop)  , because when you buy online it always ends up being lighter or darker in real life.
I really appreciate your review and POV!
I have never been drawn to packaging. I don't get that. When shopping for make-up I don't look at packaging at all. Coz what does it help when the product itself is sh**?
Loved this video!! I would have thought, though, that this brand was made by the same guys who did Kim K's line!  I dunno if I'm too sold on many of the products -- I might try the highlighter!
Love the autheticity, you are for sure the best looking wife doing stuff around the house 😉 love your videos and I love the pregnany content and home vlogs/weekend vlogs with mike the most 😊 👫🐕💖
Let's be honest white people have so many brands that work for them that's why they're not as hyped for Fenty beauty
I love how realistic you are in the video & review
Fleur, I love how your initial fail of not attending the party is turning out. This video with you all excited about trying new products is lovely to watch, you look absolutely stunning, and your review is the one I'll trust on this range. Sending love ♥
do you put on liquid foundation before putting on the Estée Lauder powder? And is it the Estée Lauder double wear cushion bb you used? X
Finally someone who doesn't like trophy wife! Looks like a sparkly golden shower on people's face
Yeah! Everything in focus! Please always film this way. Brilliant x
Thats it.. I'm buying me some Fenty Beauty!! lol
You're so pretty💕
the blotting paper packaging is such a cool idea! i just wish it worked! great video! xo from my channel to your’s <3
The products are interesting but that blotting of paper would probably be a no go for me! ❤️\nYou definitely have that pregnancy glow! 😃
That lip gloss is beautiful! Thank you for the honest review.\nAnd you look absolutely glowing! Hope you are feeling ok lovely xx❤️👍
I bought some of the products and was super impressed by the quality.
What colour do u wear in the Estée Lauder?
You remove your make - up and still you look just as amazing as before! ^^
I love the contour stick on you. You look fresh.
Which nailpolish do you have on your nails?
You're looking more like your sister now.
I bought the gloss in Stockholm last week and like you it looks really nice on me, and the smell is lovely! It was a total frenzy in the Sephora there so that was all I was able to try. Great review!  Thanks xxxx
These subtle hues were beautiful on you.Apart one review I saw this morning, everybody is liking this foundation and the highlighters, thanks Rihanna and thanks to you for this moment of calm with makeup !
fleur: complains about those in-between blusher/highlighters and not quite knowing where to apply them\nalso fleur: proceeds to make it look SO GOOD
Fleur thinks she looks rough. 😂😂😂😂 she should see me on a regular basis
Really enjoyed your watching your review, have a great day!
I loveeee that you did a first impressions too 😍 proper reviewer, honestly is the best policy 👏🏽💕
Definitely recommend going in to store to get colour matched - I went yesterday and it was such a good experience! Also the different shades have warm and cool undertones and so going up a number might not mean a darker shade. I thought I would be 150 from looking online but ended up with 130 which is a similar shade but with a different undertone meaning it looked darker on my skin and a much better match!
Thank you for making this! I definitely trust your opinion because I tend to like the same things as you :)
I wanted to say thank you for doing this!  A lot of vloggers who are not women of color are turning their noses up at this. Thank you for doing this for your colorful audience!
I really like this video. I'm not really into Fenty Beauty or Rihanna but I was curious if you would like it. I think you gave good and honest feedback that was really helpful for people who do want to invest/spend their money on these products. I also like the old school feel of this video. Because youtube videos has become really professional in the last few years (not necessarily a bad thing), the production of the video's has really gone up which sometimes gives me the feel of video's being a commercial instead of someone's opinion I can relate to. This is not a criticism on your other video’s btw, just wanted to say I really like this video in particular. Honest, helpful and relatable.
what shade are you in estee lauder double wear cushion?
Which colour you have in the Estee lauder cushion foundation .😄
The only Fenty beauty video I've watched! I'm intrigued by the brand but felt so overwhelmed by all the videos in my sub box. This appealed to me though, probably because it's you Fleur ☺️👍🏼
i've missed the tutorials ! :)
Really REALLY loved this style of video, including the natural looking lighting. It seemed very spare of the moment and I got the feeling you weren't planning on putting the makeup on to start with. Something about it just seems so natural and friendly (not saying you aren't always friendly 😁) keep them coming and I hope you are keeping well xxx
Best review I have seen on this brand! Love it!
Fleur's reviews are the best reviews 💕
Fleur one of the perks of this Fenty Beauty range is that it has the same initials as yours ! That's so cool !
I think I know what I will buy now as I wasn't sure which products to go for. Thanks for the review.
I just discovered your channel and I keep coming back to this video idk why😂 Love your personality
Loved this style of video!
First, they take out the the headphone jack.\nNext, the home button.\nThen, the internal hardware.\nLast, the software.\n\njust like Tim Cook wanted. \n\n\nA slab of GLASS...

It's a joke. Get the V30 or S8 plus everything else is inferior to those phones price and spec wise. And this is going to be $1000 lmao and it isn't even full 1440p! It's between 1080 and 1440 oh and they're copying the V30 by using oled lol
This shit had me dying the whole time😂😂😂😂
*When your dad unironically calls it a dongle*
The only good thing Apple changed is moving to OLED screens.
when you are asleep your girlfriend will just hold your phone in front of your face and she's in, no need for her to look out the corner of her eyes anymore.
It's fucking got emoji shit and face ID
We call it iPhone X because we added anemojis, which equal XD
Your parodies are the best thing about the new iphones. Think that's how i originally found your channel
It took everything from Samsung galaxy s8 and added emojis good job Apple
Thank you for you life juice😀
I kinda wanna buy this just to read the whole emoji movie script into it with one of the animated emoji's
This iPhone x is gay it's just the 7 like he says its completely different from like iPhone 7, except now it's 800$
I can't believe my Gaming Development teacher played this for us during class.
That moment he says it costs the same as 3 switches and two games... man, I should buy a switch
They played this fucking video on my local radio station. Crazy.
iPhone X Hackers be like: I need to print someone's face
First the headphone jack, and now the home button.\n\nWhat next, the volume and lock button?
I just got the iPhone 7 f the iPhone X
👏🏽I'm👏🏽so👏🏽glad👏🏽you👏🏽included👏🏽the👏🏽scroll👏🏽down👏🏽thing👏🏽this👏🏽concerned me👏🏽so👏🏽fucking👏🏽much👏🏽
Pros and Cons of the iPhone X:\n\nPros: It's not a case of herpes.\nCons: It's an Apple iPhone.

Didn't know Apple signed up for XXXTentacion's record label
Headphone jack, home button, money... Who needs it, right?
X means 10 in Roman numerals
lol I got a galaxy note 8 ad before this
I was expecting\n\niPhone\nX GON GIVE IT TO YA
The Iphone X is available in many fun, new colors! OK, BYE.\nOh, and the AR Emojis? \nYou didn't really ask for it, so here you go.
You guys wanted something new rather than the same iPhone every year...\nGUESS WHATT\nyou got it\nA completely new looking design, bevel-less design, and no home button.\nIf this isn't what you meant when you said I want something other than the same thing thatey have been doing for the last 5 years then what is ?\n\nWhat else could you want ? A longer lasting battery ?\nIf they just released the same design but with a bigger battery, you all would be pissed and say: It'S tHe sAmE tHiNg !!!\nWell thats what you wanted right ?
I still have my galaxy s4 from 2013 and I love it. Waste of money if you buy these junks.
wow, the ad is Samsung Galaxy Note 8
In some places, the iPhone 8 breaks the $1000 mark.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH, i love that when you said a good laptop a Dell was shown! Dell is the best and this is the best iPhone X parody
We're gonna build an iwall and make you pay it \n-apple
People are always complaining about the price tag, WELL IN AUSTRALIA IT'LL ME EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE
This is the funniest video I have ever seen. Awesomely sarcastic
One more thing... \nIf you send a dick pick to your homie and he screen shot, who gay?
my mom found this video on facebook and i had to leave the room because i couldnt handle her watching john filmography
NASA hurry up with your SpaceX project and show Apple how it's done.
Lol that's all I have to say
So I will be buying an iPhone Xmoji in the colour ‘you cant’.
I think theres lots of unnecessary of technology these days completely waste energy and time where could of spent on big world environmental issues. For me, iphone 4 is enough,  its just a phone end of the day. Enough is enough, lots of other important world issue to solve. Peace
I got a Samsung ad before this video......
Did they need to remove the homebutton to get room for the other shit? I feel like it would be better if they stopped working on new designs and just focused on things like water/heat/coldness resistance, camera quality, battery duration, the strength of the screen and room for a SD card.
First the headphone jack now the home button. Can't wait for what's next!! Could it be the screen maybe?
Sad thing is people will still buy the IPhone X... smh
who the fuck wants to watch a movie or photos with a stupid notch in the way?
People who buy Apple products are retarded.
The thing that people are not getting is that Apple didn't put out the iPhone X as this year iPhone offering. That's what the 8/8 Plus are. They put it out there as a guideline for the future of iPhone. They said it yourself, it's the future of the smartphone as they see it. Think of it as the concept cars that manufacturers show except Apple is capitalizing on that saying let's get even more money from the people dumb enough to buy it. And yes it's really expensive. I wouldn't personally buy it. And I don't even need to upgrade from the 7 I have which runs great.
am gonna get the afford it color and get my phone to take my soul XD
As soon as Apple announced the Iphone 8, it was outdated
Imagine if he was still alive. We would have some revolutionary phones
A copy of samsung 👏👏 bravo
uhh, sorry. i already sold my soul to andrew hussie.
omg i laughed so hard at this

All I can ever be to you,\nIs a darkness that we knew,\nAnd this regret I've got \naccustomed to,\nOnce it was so right,\nWhen we were at our high,\nWaiting for you in the hotel at night,\nI knew I hadn't met \nmy match,\nBut every moment we could \nsnatch,\nI don't know why I got so attached,\nIt's my responsibility,\nAnd you don't owe nothing to me,\nBut to walk away I have no capacity\n\n[Chorus:]\nHe walks away,\nThe sun goes down,\nHe takes the day but I'm grown,\nAnd in your way, in this blue shade\nMy tears dry on their own,\n\nI don't understand,\nWhy do I stress A man,\nWhen there's so many bigger things at hand,\nWe could a never had it all,\nWe had to hit a wall,\nSo this is inevitable withdrawal,\nEven if I stop wanting you,\nA Perspective pushes true,\nI'll be some next man's other woman soon,\n\nI shouldn't play myself \nagain,\nI should just be my own \nbest friend,\nNot fuck myself in the head with stupid men,\n\n[Chorus]\n\nSo we are history,\nYour shadow covers me\nThe sky above,\nA blaze only that lovers see\n\n[Chorus]\n\nI wish I could say no \nregrets,\nAnd no emotional debts,\nCause that kiss goodbye \nthe sun sets,\nSo we are history,\nThe shadow covers me,\nThe sky above a blaze that only lovers see,\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[x2]\nHe walks away,\nThe sun goes down,\nHe takes the day but I'm grown,\nAnd in you way,\nMy deep shade,\nMy tears dry
I need this song on Spotify!!! Please please please
she checks out the lyrics often but that does not distract her from singing beautifully and so effortlessly she truly is a great artist
THIS IS SO GOOD, AMY MUST  BE SMILING IN HEAVEN
dua needs to record a soul album, ASAP

Perfect two ppl to cover this song and do any justice
Ladies and gentlemen, Dua and Gallant: THE FUTURE SUPERSTARS OF MUSIC

Dear Dua, your Voice too good and  Sexy ughhh 😍😍

Roses are red🌷\nViolets are blue👀\nDua Lipa I'm here for you❤ \nAnd only you👍
I love both of them. But I would not have predicted this duet. IM SHOOK AND AMAZED.
Now I can die in peace, I always wanted to hear Dua covering Amy Winehouse, RIP beautiful soul she would've been 34 years by now, gone too soon!
THIS IS LITERALLY MY FAVORITE AMY SONG OMFG

all I can think of is the fans who wished to listen to Dua covering an Amy Winehouse song one day
I like this song better than the original. Doesn't mean the original is bad tho. but I love dua lipa's husky voice, she should do this kind of song in the future
THIS NEEDS TO BE ON ITUNES RIGHT THE FUCK NOW
Fuck, Dua lipa's voice gives me life
Real shame that people are saying it should be Dua by herself. This probably wouldn't have even happened if it wasn't for Gallant smh. Put some respect on my man's name.
dua's voice is rlly similiar to amy'sss <33
I have never been more bi
I love the lipa so sooo sooooo bloody good xx
What mics are they using?

And this is why she is a power house!!!!!   She have a black soul inside her!!!
OMG, you guys are amazingg... perfect duet. Dua is a queen
Não conhecia Dua Lipa, mas gente, eles não conseguem errar mesmo. Que vozes!

I've heard better at the zoo.
Sounds like two stuffed noses trying to blow the snot out-
Stretching further than I can sea.\n\n\n\n......ok I'll go now 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😅😅😅
Who was that dude walking with bags in the background 😂
That black thing is bobolatay
I caught a sea devil
When I was growing up in the Philippines I spent all Summer at the beach with my cousins and friends and some days a few of them would accidentally step on sea urchins....the cure? We would take turns urinating on the affected foot....it worked all the time!
Wow the shrimp was really pretty and bright and cute
I love your Videos because you teach much more than the School teaches me <3
Saw a guy carrying his groceries along the beach...
go to a adventure with KSI plz :-)
When i see the word island,what do you see? Lol... coyote so u english?
That eel at the end  Oh crap, they see me
That was really nice Mantis shrimp you found
Watch the crabo or you get a stabo
LOL, this is the first time I see Coyote not know the name of an animal.😲🤐🦀
I've gotten spiked by a sea urchin and I'm only 14
U should make a vid in 360°
You should be on animal planet
Is a helmet urgent eat coral
where there are rocks, there are tidepools. where there are tidepools...................there are rocks.
That shrimp creature lives in my family water tank!
Coyote: I hope you don't get a crab in your butt buddy!\n\nMe: Aw thanks!
Helmet urchins arent eaten but a large red colored variety is eaten raw
What's your new little friends name, Coyote?
For those who disliked, explain why u disliked it, how can u not like this guy he's amazing
Can we get a video basically just introducing all the crew that work on this channel and the adventures? I'd love to see everyone who has a hand in it.
6:04 I see someone with a blue shirt in the far distance in the background
wow that is cool animammal i like that so much.
I took a stinger in my figure
I got spiked by one if the exact same seceis once I was 5 (first one)
The helmet sea urchin was so cool looking!!!
2:57 The guy from Tiananmen square seems to have moved to Hawaii
How this is probably the channel that earns subs the most
Hey! why did ya flip us off?!? ( 7:03 )
I learn alot from watching these brave wilderness videos like the sea kukambas
I love this guy
I couldn't help but laugh when he said -can u imagine a crab crawling up ur butt
Love the intros keep up the Great Work!
Is it weird that I think that the purple sea urchin is adorable?
I went to Maui and saw a bunch of crabs and sea turtles and they say you are not allowed to interfere with them
i love the fact that the camera man interacts with him this channel is so good
NEVER PICK UP A SEA URICHIN
I've been to this same area in Hawaii! It truly is a huge island and one of the best places to look for interesting stuff
I'll keep it partially in the water. *brings it completely out of the water in front of the camera*      It=sea urchin
Coyote should go into the bite zone with a dragonfly....if that's actually true that they bite.
The ad in the middle of the video was an Ad for women condoms lol
When you jumped into the shot instead of being in it / walking into it was amazing ! haha love your passion guys you're doing great keep it up !
1:28 it's adventure time!
I have a banded coral shrimp in my reef tank lol
It's like a coral shrimp or something - and the student becomes the master :p
This should be on tv
97_jawa to be able the most popular games and a few weeks ago 💩
I see shrimps like that in my grandmas building at the lobby
Iiiit's adventure time!!! I love that show
0:26 When i see the word island what comes to your mind\neehm
Its a banded coral shrimp they eat algy
Bear Grylls who?
Great shrimp grab
I sub
3:46 lizard thingy on bottom right
Coyote:*drops sea urchin an clutches hand*\nMark: did it get ya?
Sonic
Your so amazing
I love Animals
CONGRATULATIONS ON 8 MILLION
next time say anus pls
The best
well ... he got nailed....
im worried for him
8 million subs
get spiked by a catfish
Yesterday I saw a star fish which was white and orange . I have no idea how i saw it , was camouflage
Me around animals: \nBE CAREFUL THEY HAVE SUPER SENSITIVE EARS!!!!!!!!!!!!\nCoyote:\n*whispers but voice is still audible* They have very sensitive ears.
I got your book
What is it?\nSome sort of weird shrimp.\nWhat's in there?\nSome weird shrimp creature.\nOMG, what is that?\n*IT'S SOME SORT OF WEIRD SHRIMP CREATURE*
I love it when he searches the water because there's so much interesting animals that haven't been discovered yet!\n\n\nEdit: Urchin is my city
Right after he caught the shrimp I had a red lobster shrimp fest commercial
You should go to hanauma Bay on Oahu you can snorkel there and there is alot of sea Animals and scuba dive
I just got an account to subscribe to u great channel keep up the brilliant vids\n\nAnd how do take so much pain (in previous vids) (and this one)
100 degrees! how hot is midday?
Congrats on 8 million 🎉🎉
it's like a tv show but if you forget to record it you can still watch it
Hehe THAT FISH WAS BEING PULLED BY THE EARS
you ever think about how thats probably the first time that shrimp has ever left the water? wonder what he's thinkin about up there besides being terrified. does he like the view? id like to know. ok ill go now
He needs a show on animal planet
The brave wilderness team is literally living the dream. Making a living by travelling the world and educating people about wildlife. You guys are amazing!
What kind of shoes are those coyote?
8:43 scared me so bad I was like AHH good thing I'm home alone
It can actually chew through rock\nplaces mouth of creature on his hand
*I hope you don't have a crab up your butt, Buddy*
MAKE A BRAVE WILDERNESS MOVIE!!!

Eight devote classroom derive credit doll essential judicial.
How did that happen?  pew pew
Biggest fan since 400k
RANDOM COMMENT IS HERE PAPA
Black ice huh? Well white snow causes more harm to people than black ice.
What if he actually found an extinct species of an animal.
So, are there 4 members of the Coyote Crew? There is Coyote, Mark, Mario, and Sasquatch... right?
This guy should have 20 mil he is doing this just to show hs
As always Coyote... You made my day... You are a role model for thousand of people... I love your videos, please... never stop makin' them!
I know folks are upset we took apart the instructions but there was no choice as the set only arrived the evening before the build and LEGO has not released the PDF yet. In order for an sorters/pickers and an interior/exterior team to be working we had to do it. Luckily it's spiral bound and can be reassembled. Also, the box was pretty squished during shipping.
That micro ear rape in the beginning...
I want one so bad now!
Now that's what I call Lego! ^^ The whole squad has formed for this special moment.
10 professional model builders 12 hours, that's 120 hours. I wonder how long it would take for one nonprofessional to it?
I can buy iphone x with this -_-
Soo wish I could have, and build that, and that last part of the time lapse where you put the top on was just so gorgeous.
I built this when I was younger, took me a couple months. Had to sell it and my whole collection when I enlisted, cool to see other people appreciate t
I'd love to see a video on how you guys got those amazing time lapse tracking shots. What kind of rig did you use for that?
NOPE! I cant watch this!!!! my kryptonite!  I must be responsible with my money!!!!
I would like to see upgrades and expansion, I just watched a 13:21 YouTube video
Anyone want to give me $800? I'll let you build the Falcon with me :D
3 days to build I'll pass
i wish i could afford something like that, that is my dream lego set. oh and the apollo set too, but mainly this one. i have the small falcon but ive always wanted the larger much more detailed model.
at over the 800 dollar mark they can fuck off
It would be cool if they made a size equivalent Slave I. Now that would be cool...
After 300 comments, does anyone really keep reading?\n\n\nIf so, Adam did not get Huck Finned into this. The owner of the set got Huck Finned on to the channel. I'm sure there was a lot of arm twisting involved.\n\n#WannaGetHuckFinned
how many times can I like this?
Pay me and I'll do that too.
Who else cried a little when they saw the dent in the top corner of the box?
You will need a table only for the manual 😂😂😂
Tommy, you got to meet Adam???
I expected a mere review-- not the whole build! Best mix of blur and stop motion plus camera move. With critical focus, I say a brand new look.\n\nGood crowd.
The thing is you can buy a cheaper-end, but good enough 3-D printer, get the bootleg lego files and print your own(may need to paint some) and still be cheaper than buying this set.
watch someone accidentally knock it with their arm off the table
They should sell this in chunks so you could buy a quarter panel at a time and break the bank in slow motion
That's like the best conversation starter ever
It would've been cool to see as a livestream!!
anyone got a spare $800 for me? lol
Wow, that's an intense build!
Woah, another Item that I will never be able to buy. Very jealous
I'm about 14 hours in 1 person and have about 3/16 left to build
Every Lego fans wet dream is the set been a while since I own a lego set I sold all of my legos
It's like I'm listening to Little Green Bag, only that's not Little Green Bag. Isn't that weird?
This is awesome, but how could you rip the pages out of the book?!?
We're the bags not numbered?
So this is what was keeping Adam from the AMA
I want it but it costs soooo much money!
And if you think this is bad at $800, you still have to add tax...
Would love it but 650 quid for a lego set is a little steep
12 total hours but how many Man-hours?
It took 5-7 people 12 hours? RIP me, even if I could afford it, it would take me a week to build.
I think it's a bad sign that I don't want to watch the video so it doesn't spoil me anything if I buy it when it will be released in larger numbers...
Imagine the person / people that designed that kit...
I'm not even that into Lego and I want one.
This set will be super rare within the year
I love the fact the a group of grown men broke into groups to put together a lego set. NEAT.
At least I get to enjoy watching you guys build this. \nI don't think I'll ever have the spending cash to ever buy this set.
Of course tested logo covers up details lol
PLOT TWIST: having the biggest lego ever and there is only one small piece missing from the set
Now i just need to justify an $800 lego set.... hmmm
All right guys, lets see Tested do the Bandai 1/72 Millennium Falcon Perfect Grade model kit build retailing for about $400 when it comes out.
800$ :(
$800
have ya seen this 11k piece moc? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5XcVgqoUbM
█▬█ █ ▀█▀ 18+ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ➨ http://tinyurl.com/ybnvl52z
Tested Team, assemble!
Only $800.
Comparing the 2 models, excellent
This is insane.
Grown men...
Pretty nifty
Where's Simone?
easy fap
$800? Insane.
$800? Holy fucking shit
dagnabit!
5:00 Sean in X-wing helmet
Awesome vid! :)
Good to see Tested going over this set--but I must add, Norm's shirt is a lovely sort of simple, very awesome.
Sad that the tore out the pages of that beautiful instruction manual.
Noooooo why the time lapse?!  I wanted to see the build and hear the banter etc!
too many cooks in the kitchen Kappa
Both of them are cool. I wouldn't chose one as better one. Nice build guys.
Actually down voted i think the original looks better. It looks far more like a Lego kit than the new one which looks like more of a cheap plastic model kit to me. \n\nAlso would have liked a slower time laps so we could see each section being built propperly. The focus was too.much on the main unit and the human movement rather than the build and the intrecessy of the model. I think this could and should have been shot and edited allot better.
The price of this piece could make you wanna shit bricks...
I feel bad when Adam implies only the new one has a printed radar dish and then the video cuts to the old one
Are you going to do the bandai one too in the future?
so... around 9 people named and 12 hours of work =  around 100 man hours to complete (assuming that not all 9 worked all the time).
That time lapse was so cool
And who says Lego's is for kids only. lol
12 hours. That not so ba....\n_The WHOLE Tested team contributed_\nHoly crap....
Awesome review guys. Mine will be at my house Tuesday. Can't wait to build it!
They couldn't even let Norm talk, the excitement was too high... Great set btw, I wish I had the moneys.
So many orgasms during the unboxing
Let the Wookie win!
$899.99 CAD for those who are wondering. That said it will likely be even more if you want to get one since they will fly off the shelves and you will likely have to buy one from someone who bought a bunch just to flip them on  ebay.
I built mine in 12 hours all by myself without sorting through bricks...I'm guessing I'm pretty fast then
I want to build it so bad but $1300 for Lego might be silly
thanks to these fuck sticks doing the video of the saturnV build, that set is still unavailable. can't wait to not be able to get this set either!
The Docs are meant to be round \nLook at the real movie prop...
Wait what!? The new millenium falcon should have a rectangular radar dish... I'm quite confused. What do you guys at tested think?
Just imagine if they both fell over and the pieces got mixed up...
It's funny how lego went from an affordable kids toy to overpriced adult collector sets, $800.00  for lego?
Is this something that anyone with $800 will be able to pick up? Cause I wanna start saving now so maybe I can get one before the next trilogy begins production.
That was fun to watch.  \nI have no need to build it. \nNow. \nSaved myself  a lot of money.
I feel like I'm the only person on the planet that doesn't get LEGO. When I was a kid, I just had a big bucket of generic, non-LEGO blocks. And when we wanted to build something, we had to figure it out for ourselves. If you want to build a model to display, why wouldn't you buy a model kit?
8:50 Adam called them Legos!
I'm a little disappointed by the smoothed-out parts. I loved the first one and wish I'd kept mine. Still really looking forward to getting my hands on this!
I was guessing around $350 but fucking Christ on a bike I could get a really nice jazz bass for cheaper
Nothing more scary in the 70's than an old fridge containing Jimmy Saville and Gary glitter.
1 less VLOG on the trending makes me happy
What happens when the soviets attack and we've smashed all the doors off our Fridges? How will we protect ourselves from the nuclear blast wave?!
I spent the best years of my childhood playing hide n seek in an old fridge....
why the fuck is this trending
I'm tired of all this Fridgophobia
Don't suppose anyone clicked after being reminded of the Triforce! Podcast?
Why is this on the trending page lmfao
I swear they talked about this on a recent Triforce episode?
Wait a minute, I saw a fridge save Indiana Jones' life from a nuclear bomb  in the kingdom of the Crystal skulls,  and I trust Indy more than I trust the government.
I knew fridges couldn't be trusted. And they all thought I was mad.
To you, it's just a worn out fridge...\n\nBut to Indiana Jones it's the means to live through the effects of a nuclear bomb.
why the fuck is this trending
My mum knows someone who's child did exactly that and died of suffocation.
Hi, kids. Can you say natural selection?\n\nNo? Well, I'll just leave you alone with this old fridge and we'll see if you make the species stronger or not.
0:26 OK so now we know how the thousands of missing children over the decades were stuffed in fridges and taken to paedophiles
I play with an old fridge everyday and I haven't died yet 👌🏻
Maybe they wanted to die, who are we to deny a child the right to death by fridge?
My new video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvJb1bVgVRA more retro fun
All new refrigeration appliances have a magnet which enables the door to be easily opened if someone decides to get inside.\nThis video is just old history.
Is it impossible to open the fridge from the inside? This makes me want to climb inaide one and try it.
Please explain how a video with 35k views gets in trending, YouTube?
Wtf will i use for a castle now
This is serious..i was killed in the 70's by an old fridge.
This campaign must have run deep, I still see white goods dumped, but at least they took the door off
More like killing a child's dreams of killing themselves
In America you eat from the fridge in Soviet Russia fridge eats you
Why does this PIF (Public Information Film) STILL scares the living day lights out of people?.
I've been living with one of these silent killers all my life. Please send help.
At least it would preserve the corpse.
It saved Indiana Jones... yep that happened
Russian kids would've no problem
Why is this trending? Are fridge deaths on the rise
why is this trending in 2017
Yeh, this would have been much better narrated by pflax as Sean Bean
Now the kids are just eating the entirety of the content in the fridge . .yay obesity . If kids knew they could kill might scare em off a bit
People say this for many things but this is the best example\n\n\nWhy is this trending ?!
What the fuck
This is trending cos of Noel fecking Fielding isn't it 😅 God damn it Noel, you fridge lurking loon!
This is trending because in a recent episode of Great British Bake Off, one of the presenters (Noel fielding) was locked in a fridge as part of a transition clip I believe, and there were loads of complaints to ofcom about it, as many children have died by getting stuck in old fridges and freezers.
Wtf
Kim Jong-Un making this trend?
The triforce podcast
Why is this 33 on trending though
One saved Indiana Jones.
Anyone here from YogPod Triforce?
THANKS EVERYONE!!!
This was on TV recently.
Why is this trending???!? Lol
This is what YouTube needs more of these old classic British videos
I'm well happy something very British is trending. Pleasant surprise uploader or did you kind of expect it? XD
why would i ever go into a fridge?
Who the hell keeps an old fridge at home?
Indiana jones survived in one
Why is this trending?
Old fridges can kill??? Omg didn't know the 70s had sentient fridges. They kept that one hidden... 😱
they don't make them like this anymore
I'm assuming this public service announcement is so on the nose and heavy handed because something serious happened...
Why is this number 14 on trending
Good!  One less mindless Vlog on trending!
Chilling
0:13 Boy, that escalated quickly
Ok then
Ok. I'll remember
The most British thing ever. FRIDGES ARE THE REAL PROBLEM WAKE UP SHEEPLE
#42 ON TRENDING\n\nWhat?
Old fridges can kill!!
why is this trenidng 2011 rly..
Don't play inside of fridges, noted. Thanks again for this. 
The Great British Bake-Off.
It's sad when Google/YouTube promote a 70s ad instead of promoting ads for YouTubers.
The YogPod sent me. Be Warned.
Nowadays the danger of this is invisible because fridges now have magnetic seals instead of locks and they put masking tape over the doors to keep children out.
nuke bomb shield to indaina jones
What a shame! I'm single, on benefits, and I bought a luxury fridge freezer for £2000. It got me into a lot of debt and now I've been evicted. I thought I could live in my fridge as its big enough but I guess not. Oh well, I'll have to shiver on the streets instead.
I remember the BBC broadcasting this child safety film inbetween Jim'll Fix It and Top Of The Tops
Do a house tour!!!

You are one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen 😊
Feeding wildlife is by far the dumbest thing she can do. Once the deer is no longer afraid of human contact she's going to get killed.
Do it! if YOU want blue hair then go for it!!! its YOUR hair, go for it! who cares what anyone else thinks!? Your hair is on YOUR head!! No one pays your bills except for you,  do what makes you happy!!!!! 💞 I really think you'll look fabulous!!! I finally went pink and purple and I love it!!!! I'm very happy!!!!
I love her so much
Do blue and purple
Thank god u were able to keep your dad safe & make it back safe and in time. I live in Florida and me and my little girl still don't have any power... Hopefully soon...  &🙂Thank you so much for your kind words, carli. 😊😍😘 ur awesome.
Yes do it! It's just hair it grows and you can change it if you don't like it
Hope all is well. Praying for you! Love your videos, but take care of yourself and your family!
I love you Carli you're so beautiful
Please do navy blue hair !
Yes!! Do the BLUE HAIR!! 💙💙💙
Better things are coming, babe!!! Keep your head up, we love you 🌟🌟🌟
What camera are you using to vlog now? Still Sony A5000? :)
Who is this yall she's pretty?? IG model or YTr?!
I told my bf I need to buy heels so I bought one pair and hardly wear them 🙈 I really need to go out more 👍 I think you should go blue if you want to since hair grows out I think you'll be fine if you don't like the result it ain't going to stay forever 💕
I've loved you for years & hope all gets better sweet girl<3
Love your videos, always! I definitely think you should do a color. With your eye color a dark blue or plum purple would be so pretty! Plus with fall and winter coming up it's a great time to do it. ❤️
you aint shit with or without makeup
I. Would. Die. 💙💙💙\nYou need blue hair!!!!
hey there Carlie I rather you stay with black hair. However I want you to do what makes you happy just take care of your hair and treat it well while coloured and you'll be fine
you should do a cruella de vil halloween tutorial but not a cosplay one
where is her bf?
Blue hair yes! I have long black hair that I also want to dye a dark blue 💙
Omg yes dye your hair navy blue!! I have the same hair color and length and I did a temporary navy blue dye and it looked really good. I think it would look beautiful on cause of your eye color 💙
Ur gorgeous , but I'm sorry I literally only watch 30 seconds into your videos and then close off, something about ur videos is so boring
I can't believe that's her real hair !
YES on the dark navy blue hair
For sure try the blue hair I think it was be so pretty on you with your eye color
Yes do the hair
Yes go for navy blue hair!!
Dye your hair blue!!!! Don't be scared!!!! It's just hair! Shit look at mine it's pink and I love it
Try dying a wig (maybe a lace wig) and wear it for a bit and if it suits you, you can dye your own hair. But the blue would go great with your eyes 👀
You should definitely do the blue hair!!!!!
Thanks for posting this! Missed your videos, this looked really cool..hope all is well! :)
Whatever is going on things will get better. Love you Carli and stay strong babygirl 😘💕
do it!!!! tint your hair blue i have black long hair like you and ive been debating it too
Any youtubers want to support each other? :)
I love your cats! There so cute and naughty 🐱🐱🐱😂😍😙
I love dark brown plum hair. Its worth a try.
Yes midnight blue for the hair 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
You need to buy a temperpedic mattress you'll die it's amazing!!!!!!

Okay so this might sound like a dumb question but is vegan products automatically cruelty free and are cruelty free products automatically vegan? 🤔
I love that you don't care about the price of close if you liked it will be enough, so cute 💋
Hi guys I hope you all have good weekend 😍 I'm starting my YouTube channel and really means a lot to me if you visited it and give me your opinion ☺️ please help me and like this comment ☺️😘
So glad you're safe- I was so worried when you said you were going to Florida!
I would love the dark blue. It looks stunning on people with your skin tone
I need to step out of my comfort zone and meet new people! It amazes me to hear that you don't go anywhere alone because you seem so friendly and easy to talk to and be friendly! So to hear that you are doing things alone makes me want to as well
I think you should totally dye your hair blue!
BLUE HAIR YAAAAS 💙

Hi Carli, I've been following your social media and watching your videos for years now but I am officially a subscriber as of today (just figured out YouTube lol wtf) I as well as so many other of your supporters can tell you are going through a lot right now. I just wanted to say I love you and that it's so awesome and appreciated that you still make time to post videos through your hard times. Your videos have gotten me through plenty of hard times of my own. I love you again! You are so beautiful and strong. xo
OMG i need to know what that cat litter box thing was!!!

Face ID is dumb because if anything is covering your face you can't use it. Like what if you're skiing/snowboarding with goggles and a balaclava, you can't unlock it whatsoever. Unless you take your gloves off to use your passcode
Its not gona happen if you keep streaming!
If you are giving away a phone or laptop please give it away to me. I if I type any symbol using my phone on YouTube it shows this ' and it's ugly so to watch your video please.

Wicked people unsubscribing. How dare you unsubscribe to the Serena Williams of Tech videos 😤
Congrats MKBHD , plan visit to India once , so many people from India subscribed to you .
Congratulation for 5 millions subscribers . Keep up the awesome work. I watch your videos almost immediately you release them.
All the trolls unsubscribing probably resubscribed once he reached 5M. If he didn't do it live, he'd have reached 5M quicker.
It says that you have 5 million already. \nI'm so confused. ;-; 🤔🤔🤔🤔\n\nNevermind. \nI understand now. 🙊
I'm 5 million away

I bet 90% of your subs are from India alone 😁
you literally explained that you are Apples servant. they invite you because its free marketing for them. Apple critizism can't be found here much.
Am I the only one who noticed that today her nouse conturing is a little bit harsh? Loveee yaaa💕💕💕
tati can you plsss try storybook cosmetics?
Nice collection
Omg that eye look has me shook 😍
That liner game 😍👏👌
75 goes TO Vicky!
Beautiful eye look
De clutter video please 🤗
😂😂😂 what a joke!!!
Can you please do a video for the Chanel Soleil tan cream bronzer please? I've heard bad things and good things about it and thinking of buying, also I love your videos so much. 💕
I would love to have this collection, to bad I am poor.  Tati, your makeup looks amazing!
Hi Tati, the bronzer you used is it in the shade Saffron Sun or Java Sun? Looks great! thanks
The eye foil looked goopy and gross
Which bronzer did you use? There are two colors and the one you're wearing is super pretty! Which one is it??
you look super snatched in this video Tati, and your eye makeup is everythinggggg
The prices are ridiculous! & The shades are not favorited by most makeup lovers. Great packaging, but geez Louise. Talk about dollar signs.
Does she not have a foundation in her collection???
$40 for one foiled shadow. Lemme go buy a 12-15 shade NICE palette from Sephora for that price. Smh 🙄 \n\nTati you know I love you, and I like watching you review higher end brands but DAMN these prices are just killing me lol
I spare no expense when it comes to makeup and skincare. The most I've ever spent on eye shadow was the Natasha Denona palettes and her single shadow is less expensive than the Victoria Beckham. The packaging is lovely but overall not worth it. If I have to spend more at Estee Lauder than I do at Chanel or Tom Ford, something is wrong. The bright blue shades mixed with nuetrals seem to be the thing this fall. Chanel has a beautiful palette for fall. It has antique gold, navy, bright aqua blue and a matte taupe.
The black liner in the lower waterline is SLAYING MY SOUL OMG
The eyeshadow duo is pricey for sure. Your make up is gorgeous. I wouldn't pay that price as I have a heck of a time with my hooded eyes
That earring!  Very beautiful!  What is the brand?
Can you make your own makeup line already?!? Please please please??? 😭😍 I love you!!!! 💕
This is one of the prettiest eye looks I've seen you do, plssss do a tutorial!!!
Although I like other youtubers, when it comes to recommendations, you Tati are the one I turn to. I love your honesty and the fact that you don't let brands buy a positive review. I hope you never loose this trait and keep doin you girl
Im more interested in knowing where you got that beautiful ring on your right hand!!!??? PLEASE
Please do a tutorial on this eye look rn please!!! Soooooo gorgeous!! 😍
60.00 for two eyeshadows that look like mini versions of a full size...pass🤚🏽 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
Not worth the price
Tati I love you makeup, please make a tutorial out of it
Wow, love your tan. These colours go well with it.
Ok tati, stop drooling over Victoria Beckham!!!. As far as that 40$+ eye foil, I have discovered one here in The Netherlands that costs about 6$ that is exactly if not better as beautiful as VB's one, and it comes in a gold and rose gold, silver, and see through black like the universe with stars, so thanks but no thanks***I'll stick to my HEMA ones...xo
Your eye make-up is phenomenal today! I haven't watched the whole video, so i don't know if there is a tutorial. If there's not, please do one. Gorgeous!
I saw the video of Victoria B doing a smokey eye on the Estee Lauder channel and figured the smudgy matte eyeliner is like using an eyeshadow to smudge your lower lashline and I had a similar magnetic brow powder applicator which worked just as fine. :)
look at me paying attention to this vid like im gonna go out and buy all this 😂
The packaging is beautiful!
Hi Tati! I would love to see you do a full face/review of either Charlotte Tilbury products or BeautyCounter products. Maybe two different videos?! Dying to know your thoughts, especially on the BeautyCounter products (all natural, but I've tried a few products and truly love them).
Tati - After one of the worst days of my life I came home, watched your video and ended up at Neiman's playing with all of the products in the collection.  I want you to know that you played an integral role in improving my mood and helping me realize my true passion in life is beauty and I need to give it all I've got!  You are an absolute inspiration!  \nBtw, can you please tell me what bronzer shade you picked up?  I want to be sure I got the right one (I got 02 Saffron Sun)!  There are like 3 shades!  Oh and I got the rosy pink lipstick (02 Burnished Rose) and it is stunning!!!!!!!  Thank you for being so fantastic and being a beautiful, consistent part of my day!
i love this eye look you have on i think its gorgeous
Love the vid and the eye shadows that's 2 small tiny eyeshadow those prices are ridiculous I'd rather stick with my modern renaissance x
I wish she would have done the RiRi review with this much enthusiasm....
I'm a little mad that the brand that Tati doesn't mention on her channel anymore was my opening add for this video... they are trying to be petty. 😂😂😂
I thought the primer was a TP holder 🤦‍♀️
I NEED a video comparing all of the eyeshadow glitters Tati!! All the formulas! Power, cream, stick, pot, weird liquid, everything! The make up forever, colourpop, and the stila and these and so many other ones I have heard are amazing but whats the difference and which ones should i get?? There are just so many and you are the QUEEN of amazingly glittery gorgeous eyes so this needs to come from you!!!
Why was the eyeliner making noise? There was a strange jingling sound coming from the thumbs down eyeliner
I think if you want good quality makeup and designer compact, it would be a perfect collection for you. It's not a must have of course, but if someone love collecting designer pieces, then it's fine. Also it would be a nice gift as well.
for some reason i always go towards the guys of makeup dior, ysl and nars ( the kings of makeup) the queens challotte tibury, victoria, chick with expensive unpatical cheap packaging kits seems like there not worth the money.
These are so pretty!!! I love how dainty Tati powders her face....im over here swirling the brush a million times and practically grinding it into my face to get it to actually do its job! LOLOL.....does it really work how she gently dabs it into the pan and sweeps it across her face so gently?!
Omg Tati, your makeup is so stunning today, you look beautiful. 😍💖
Thanks for the review. I know these products are expensive, but when you are getting into VB, you know you're in a different price bracket than most other brands and not necessarily thinking about the worth of the item in relation to its price. The products are beautiful and definitely worth collecting if you're into that sort of thing.
This look is so stunning!
Very honest opinion, rare on youtube today, \nThank you! 💛
I love Tati Reviews ❤❤❤ She always sounds so relaxed & real in her talk, I never get tired of watching her .... Andddd I wish to be so elegant like her ☺✨ aahhhh
Since you mentioned taking the person/brand out of the equation and purely focusing on makeup, can you do a review on the new too faced collection?
$95.00 for a quad? and here I thought the Tom Ford quad was expensive.... You look really pretty tho. I love that look <3
not wort the money @ all she to even a makeup artist ...... to have the price so high HELL NO
A makeup brand really need to hurry up and do a colab. with you, I would buy for sure.
I would really like to see a high end hair products hits and misses with shampoos, conditioners and masks you would recommend.
What is it with Mrs Beckham , she never smiles, is her life that bad?
I can afford all the line but i still would purchase wisely to a single item i would really love. I think its over priced for what it is. BTW i admire Victoria  Beckham. This was an accurate over view!
These prices are ridiculous. Victoria Beckham and Estee Lauder can miss me with that bullshit lmao.
In the words of Kathleen Lights DAS EXPENSIVE! 😱😭
I always appreciate your honesty Tati!
Wow eyeshadows too expensive....
Lorac Products video? Xox
tati ur eye makeup looks beautiful <3
$60 for two eyeshadows is re-dic.
First thing i noticed the beautiful shirt loved the fabric
I agree with everyone else, the prices are ridiculously high. Although if you do the math you do save money if you buy the quad eye shadows. You pay $23.75 for each pan compared to $45 for a single pan. I know I know 😂 it's still too high 💸💸
Love those earrings and the ring!!! Where did you purchase those?
Tati did you put anything under the foil on your eyelids?
ok let's take a moment to appreciate the most beautiful eye makeup i have ever come across
Anyone recognize the white handled makeup (powder) brush she used??? If you're going for a dramatic presentation of powdering your nose, you ought to have the pretty white brush too LOL!
I need a dupe for the eye foil 💕💕💕💕💕💕. If anybody can help me out💕💕💕💕💕
that foil eyeshadow is STUNNING but damn the prices are crazy like most luxury brands aren't even that much?? chanel is less expensive??????
Tati I wish you did a makeup tutorial on this makeup look its GORG !!!!
sometimes I am not even listening to you because I am just staring at your damn gorgeous face lol
I LOVE your eye makeup in this video!
Your eye makeup looks so beautiful!
The makeup looks so on fleek love!!!!
Thanks for the Review Tati! Could you please include in all of your reviews where the products were made? Thanks in advance! I love ❤️ your channel
I have to say that look you created was stunning. I just think you could do that using more reasonably priced makeup. I'm definitely willing to splurge and love Victoria Beckham but this is absolutely ridiculously priced and I can't see why anyone would spend the money. Why can't some of these celebs do more reasonable collaborations.
Try out Mary Kay makeup! The Timewise face set is awesome!
The highlighter is the exact same shade as last year lol. What are you talking about Tati?
Thanks for the review.  I'm never going to buy this line.  It's just too ridiculously priced.  It ain't happening!  xoxo
The shadows look so beautiful but so expensive. This should be a WTF video
No way jose that i would pay that much money for any brand of makeup.
Anyone who loved the way that eye foil looks but cannot do that price tag, Sonya Kashuk's eyeshadow quad in Showstopper has a shade JUST like that and it is crazy beautiful! It's like $12 for the four shadows and I love the shimmer in them.
Love your look as always ❤️
lol I always look for pretty packaging for compact powders to show it when I get it out of my purse
I'm living for that eye look Tati! Would it be possible for you to do that eye look with more affordable options?
Tati this eye look is beutiful. Maybe you should do a toutrial on it!
Amazing review! Thank you for your honesty and thorough review of some beautiful makeup! This collection is stunning! Xo
I love my luxury makeup and I prefer it to drugstore, but if I'm being completely honest, the drugstore has seriously stepped up their eyeshadow game and I honestly think you could EASILY create a dupe video for these eye shadows. And I think the price difference would be insane! \nYou're really just paying for the packaging on this line, I'm not impressed by any of the actual products though 😭
The prices are stupid high. Victoria Beckham needs to get over herself she doesn't even do anything but stand and pout. This is not a reflection on Tati, this collection is just a waste of people's money who work for it unlike Beckham
For anyone willing to spend $95 on the burgundy eyeshadow quad, buy ABH Modern Renaissance instead!!
Tati baby, these big earrings do nothing for you! ((: Love❤
I can't help but get irritated when people complain about being lazy coz they just got home from a lavish vacation when here i am wanting to be lazy but can't coz i have kids to take care of on top of lack if sleep.  Ridiculous!!!
If you have to kiss someones ass and lie to your following because you want to met a celebrity, they're not worth meeting anyway. Love you babe
She actually looks just a little bit like Victoria..
YOUR BACKGROUND IS EVERYTHING!!😩🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Keep the Adidas ones and return the & Other Stories pair. I really wish you would've shown the chain on your bag. Maybe include that in another video or an Instagram post if possible. Always love your styling videos.
I agree on Realisation Par.  That site is like crack in dress form.
keep the adidas pants! and YES to an autumn trend video! also- love when you show us your shopping process- what you pick up, try on, say no to, etc!
Love to new filming space 😍
I like the add addidas ones so much on you! I think take the other ones back! X
your style is absolutely stunning. You're totally top three of my favourite bloggers when It comes to style. I love you so much
I desperately need the A/W trends video, haha ♥
Also agree with people complaining about the wrinkled shirt...yikes....
please do a autumn/winter how to wear vid, it would be so helpful!!!
Lol why was this recommended?
You say 'Adidas' so differently lol. Here in Canada, we say A-Dee-Das
I cannot wait for your winter vlogs in London. Specially Christmas /festive season! Yass
Anyone know where she got her leggings?
I probably wouldn't keep the adidas trousers since you already got the other ones!!
What size did you get the adidas joggers in? I'm usually the same as you but everyones saying they come up small ahhh
I adore hearing you talk about clothing, it's so soothing in a way
Keep the Adidas! You have a great taste when it comes to fashion /styling <3 Kisses from Greece!
Love your Videos and also your Vlogs!!! ❤️❤️❤️ and Yes yes yes autumn/winter trends how to style \nGreetings from Germany 🙂
I've been looking for nice vinyl pants like yours but I couldn't finde any I liked... could you tell me you you got yours from?\n\nBtw love the contrast and the adidas look ;)
Why does Youtube promote your channel so heavily?
Keep Adidas pants! They both are cute💅🏾
Autumn/winter fashion is definitely my favorite too! The colors and layers loooove it so much :) Loove your fashion sense I always get a lot of inspiration from it xx
i've not seen dungarees lately at all
Can you do a haul of clothes cheaper but still a good style like yours like classy vintage?
Omg keep the adidas bottoms!! That outfit is 💣 xxx
keep the adidas! suits you way better!
also, this is one of my fav hauls you've done! and i've been watching since the  very beginning :)
where are your black leggins from :O they look awesome on you!
Thanks for the video Sam. I liked everything you picked. The only piece that I thought was a bit iffy. It's the red polka dot dress. I would be very incomplete wearing it with that very high wrap in front looks like you could have a wardrobe malfunction at any second. I would even be uncomfortable if I saw someone else wearing it bc you just know her pants will get flashed. I especially loved the jumpsuit and the stripped trousers. 🙂
Sometimes in your hauls you pull a clothing piece out and I'm thinking, idk about that item. But then you show a snippet of the item styled and I'm like, ok, yeah that looks awesome. And it always looks so good on you. You are really good at styling. And you make me want to buy pieces I would never buy. Haha. Anyways, what I'm trying to say is, I really love your styling videos and your hauls so keep 'em comin'.
That red polka dot dress is stunning😍😍😍😍
Love you gorgeous girl! ❤️ Your sense of style is spot on!
I can't even tell you how much I love you with curly hair!!!!! It looks so great on you, and that Realization Par dupe is so spot on 👀
YAAS, do that trends-video please!😍 can you do more lookbooks as well? I miss them🙂
I love the black denim skirt. Looks SUPERB on you. I also LOVE the blouse you are wearing. It's crazy to me how much H&M have stepped up their game as of late. Just a year ago there was NOTHING I wanted to buy from them. 
I really like the Adidas bottoms over the AOS stories ones, however you'll prob get more wear out of those ones as the joggers look beat with heels.. & who wears heels that often (not this mama anyway lol)
I love how you make trends completely 'yours'. Everything looks completely different on you, in the best way possible. I love and admire that! :)xX
Sam I'm more of a midi skirts and dresses kinda wearer, if that's a word 😂 and I'm wondering you could do a video of how to style skirts and dresses. I know it's not a common thing, especially living in LA, but it's very hard to find a flattering way to style them. Please consider 😁
Hi Sam <3 i totally imagine you wearing that red boohoo dress with some tights and some thigh highs just in case it got colder.
I love your style! Now I want to go shopping :)
Kinda random but I love your arm chair in your try on shots. WHere is it from????
Love your style sam !! \nMay I ask where the white chunky heels are from please ?!
Canne believe this shite trends  nowadays when back in the day a dog humping a fat burd was the video to be seen......how the bar has fallen
Some of my favorite videos from you Sammy ❤️
I love your fashion videos so much aand how u always share your honest thoughts on pieces. Please make more autumn/winter videos. I moved from Greece to Sweden and i'm really not used to dressing for this weather, so some advice on how not to look like a potato bag would be much appreciated! Looking great as always Sammi xX
keep the adidas! It looks great on you
Where is ur black leather jacket from which u tried on with those adidas track pants?!? I luv it soo much!! I luv ur style ur stunning:) xxxx
love the red polka dot but its a bit short
This is my favourite Sammi! :D I know it sounds weird AF but I mean in clothing... I feel like a/w season always boosts your confidence in clothing and I ADORE IT. Keep all the pieces, they look fab on you. xo
I always get a WOW moment when I see you with large earrings haha just because I'm not used to it. So gorgeous
okay here's what I think: keep the Adidas trousers. I'd even suggest returning the AOS trousers but I feel like you like them too much to do that hhaha. Adidas is good quality, it's the original brand so it always looks good, it's stylish (but be careful with the adidas/heels trend! better wear them with the classic black high heels!) and you can wear them at the gym as well if need be!!! other than that, the polkadot jumpsuit is gorgeous on you!! xx
I love how you styled the Adidas pants!
LOVE the contrast stripe trousers too. They look gorgeous on you! xx
Loved absolutely everything in this haul!! <3 Especially that black denim skirt Just wondering where the grey jumper you styled it with is from? Thank you so much!! xxxx
You are a queen of fast fashion
I loooove your style. Want everything in this video 😍😍
This has given me so much inspiration! Love your fashion videos 😘👍

Literally liked this video 5 seconds in because I know your vids are always fabuloussssss! LOOL xxx
I love it when you have curly hair! I also love it when you have curly hair with some curly bangs! so pretty <3
Why don't you keep the adidas pants to wear casually like when youre going to run errands or walking your dog or something...i always thought those adidas pants were for days when you want to be casual but cool.
I'm not one for trends but I love athleisure. I've been obsessed with an entire Nike, Adidas, etc. outfit with trainers. I feel stylish but super comfy at the same time.
definitely keep adidas trackies sam! so versatile - good for lounging round house, w heels as you've styled and w trainers and crop top on a night out! SUCH a staple. sport luxe is here to stay xxxx
Great picks!
I really want that dungaree dress but I can't find it :(
I would love to see a autumn/winter how to video! you're so inspiring and I feel like I can relate with your style!
your style keeps getting better and better!! Loved the skirt dungarees!
Love these new pieces! Can't wait to see a 'how to wear' video :) \nYour videos always brighten my day - do keep them up! x

How much does this bitch pay YouTube to be featured every week when she barely scrapes 80k views and only has like 300 comments?
Does anyone know how tall Sammi is? I love that boohoo red polka dot dress but it looks pretty short on her and I'm 5'9 so trying to figure out if it would be too short for me.
I wanted to cry when taika was lying on geo's chest. You could just feel the joy in her heart. I am in awe by your love to your first born ❤️
Taika has geo's nose omgggg I'm crying he's so precious
Masha'allah, the baby is Beautiful. I know its a few weeks late but Congrats on a healthy baby boy
I've been watching you guys since high-school. Late 2006'ish-2007 on MySpace and then later on YouTube. There would always be speculation on wether or not you were a couple. Nobody but the people who personally knew you both would have known how close you were until you revealed it years later. Fast forward to now, you've grown, you're married and now have a child. Time flies. Congratulations to you both!
So Strength in Hawaian, Magic in Finnish and Peace in Lithuanian, so far so good =)
The amount of times I cried watching this video is too many to count!! I'm so happy for them!
Lmao the dude wasn't even 1 day old and he was already getting lectured by his grandma
Congrats! So happy for you guys. ☺️
Geo's smile when she sees the sushi <3 She looks so adorable.
What a good boy? Lmao he ain't a dog lmao
So he was born on the first. That's cool.
That baby is so lucky to be born and soon raised in LA
Yay so proud of y’all
im so jealous of taika i want geo and bart to be my parents
The first ever Mexican Chinese hybrid lol😂 but he's soooooo cute
omg I still can't 🍼👶😺
WHen I got the notification I was at school. I was about to watch and get a citation😂
Mama Kwan is adorable with the baby!!
Bart's mom is so cute
what language is he going to learn first
Davids reaction was the cutest thing ever 😭 I'm so glad they have such supportive and great friends
I love how happy geo looks when she finally got to cuddle taikaXD
Good luck learning Cantonese, English, and Spanish, Taika.\n\nCONGRATS GUYS ON YOUR NEWBORN!! HE IS SO ADORABLEEEE. You guys are going to be great parents as he grows up. And he comes from pretty strong people too.\n\nGood luck on your parenthood journey!!!
CONGRATS BART AND GEEO!~ <3 NUMBER 41 ON YOUTUBE IN AUSTRALIA!~
Y'all now Taika my boy will beat you up when he grows up.
What an amazing group of family an friends this kid was born into. So much love and positivity
Is there a vlog where they talk about why they named the baby that ??
Wtf is wrong with Geo, she is not a human xD it's not like she's just gone through 22 hours of labor and pushed out a giant watermelon through her vagina. She looks completely normal, as if she's just had a quick poo and not pushed out a baby
Hopefully Taika learns 3 languages that would be cool to see geo talking to him Spanish only at home and bart talking to him in his language only at home too and at school talks in English
Bart how does it feel to officially be a mother f**ker?
I smiled throughout this entire video and my cheeks hurt. It's worth it! 😁 Congratulations you two! 🐻🐻👶🍼
Taika is going to be a smartie! With his parents and the multilingual environment he's going to grow up in.
David seemed to be more excited than Geo and Bart 😂
Welcome to the world, little baby. Congratulations Geo and Bart. Joe's and David's soft side lol. Taika must be protected in Joemalia.
It's so beautiful when you bring a child into the world but bringing a biracial child has so much meaning , I hope no one takes that the wrong way bc EVERY child is SO SPECIAL 💕 Being biracial to me teaches are kids no matter what race you are , where you come from everyone is meant to be LOVED . Congrats to yall on you're beautiful baby boy , sending blessings y'all's way . Again I hope no one gets offended bc like I said EVERY CHILD IS SPECIAL 💕
He's going to be super bilingual.
damn look at the balls on that kid omggg i love david XDDDD
I knew it. All that talk David did about hating kids, and now he's about to kidnap him, hahaha
Are Bart's parents divorced?
the amount of pictures david took is adorable
Congratulations bart and geo you guys will make great parents
HE IS SO CUTE!!!
Any who dislikes are trolls. How can you honestly dislike a parents most precious moment?
Awwww \n*Congratulations!*\nSuch a lovely family and friends. I love how Tiffany and David are so genuinely supportive for Bart and Geo. Not only Tiffany and David but the whole JK Community!
I hope this kid learns Spanish, Chinese and English!!! - He would know the three most spoken languages in THE WORLD!!
That baby can fkin style a pompadour with all that hair
David is so fucking funny 😂🤣😂🤣
I've been watching you guys since the 8th grade. I'm now a senior in high school and to be honest it feels like im actually having a cousin. WELCOME TAIKA <3
The kid is gonna be trilingual
When I saw how much hair the baby had and they said he was heavy it reminded me that my mom said I was born with so much hair and weighed more than 8 lbs. Since i was a big baby with a head full of hair my mom would have to tie my hair up and use baby powder everywhere on me bc i would sweat a lot. I was not even a year old and my mom could tie up hair.
Congratulations! I love that you played Jason Mraz for your baby.
Happy farther's and mother's day
Taika is going to know so many languages :)))))))))))))) congrats Bart and Geo
Lmao i love when jess said he has barts flat feet bart started showing the camera his feet 😂😂😂
I had a little anxiety watching your friends touch and hold baby without washing their hands.😬Maybe they did it off camera?🤞Congratulations 🎉
Congratulations!!!!! Your baby boy is beautiful and I know y'all will make great parents~♥️♥️♥️ His name is hella dope too hehe🔥🔥🔥Welcome to the world, Baby Beaw!
Taika is already smarter than me- he's gonna grow up to be trilingual 🤦🏽‍♀️😂❤️❤️GOALS I'm just bilingual wth
😭😭CONGRATULATIONS I CANT STOP CRYING SOOOOO BEAUTIFUL God bless u guys are goign to.  The best parents ever
Hey....who's cooking onions \n(´༎ຶོρ༎ຶོ`) \n\nAny who congrats Bart and Geo I can't wait to see the family vlogs with the bears
This kids gonna be smart. He's gonna learn 3 languages
That baby looks like a fucking warrior
David's so cute in this, he's so excited 😂

You know when you know something for your entire life but you just don't really realize it's true? \nWell it just hit me that HUMANS COME OUT OF VAGINAS AND THEN THEY MAKE MORE HUMANS AHHHHH\nW T F ! ?
Wow somebody already made a taika kwan channel
I wonder how fast the sheep's will line up for this one
So.. I can call people with it, right?
I am pretty sure they can make huge money this time because the iPhone X will help remove Apple's old goods in stock completely!
What if I have an iPhone SE and an iPhone X??😜😜😜
I got the Apple Store App on my iPhone 7 plus  man you won't believe of the price for the 256 GB? it's $1,150 for a phone god damn Cell Phones back in the 2000s was like $200 or $300 here's 2017 the most expensive cell phone in the world 256GB iPhone X is $1,150 Bruh I need to change the iPhone 8 to 7S cuz the 7 & 8 look the same???
Is anyone creeped out that he thinks the phone is absolutely beautiful? Does he not get out much?
What if swipe up from upper middle corner !
Iphone x not worth of 1k...
I wonder what happend to i phone 9
what happens if u get plastic surgery???
Finally found an apple x video without a disabled comment section.
It’s annoying how android users tell Apple to “catch up”, and when they finally match to the current technologies eg minimal bezel, wireless charging etc, android users slam Apple for “stealing features” \n\nSamsung and other Android phones would be nowhere without Apple. Pinch to zoom, dual cameras etc etc...the whole aesthetic of the original iPhone has started a major influence on the current android phone market.
might as well buy a titan xp
It didn't unlock when the guy looked at it. Are u pulling a Craig.
Dumb rollout, no iPhone 9, an 8 and 10 released same quarter?
For some reason, it strongly reminds me HTC phones style
Looks like a rip off samsung
What happens when you use your face to unlock the phone but puberty hit you hard so it doesn't recognize you?
Samsung's ahead of Apple Samsung was the first to had waterproof phone and wireless charging
i still have the iphone 4 with ios 6
What dumbass thought a glass back would be good?
Where's y and z
No matter what anyone says, Apple always sells more phones than any other company.
when do these come out ?
if someone steals your phone...just keep your eyes closed....rofl😂😂😂
So when you wake up in the morning and want to unlock it in the dark I assume it puts a light in your face and blinds you or just doesn't work without the Touch ID
I don't like the bulge.
Apple has just been shittier every year
You could also probably use a pic to unlock it 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
First the headphone jack now the home button what next the screen??!
Samsung phone with apple logo and software on it!
iPhone x or iphone 8 or 8 plus I choose x
Do I need to sell my soul, or won't that be enough to afford it?
PERSON:what do you think about the new iPhone \n\nME:its expensive
What if you take a video of someone who owns a iPhone X  opening and closing their eyes????
iPhone 10? What happened to 8 and 9?
I'm never getting one of those there confusing
This phone is so ugly I just buy Samsung s8
Can I pay with my kidney?
What happens if you get a black eye a scrape on your face or anything like that
How do u go from 8 to 10
I like the home button 😭
So the iPhone is watching us now
let me tell you guys something. About 90% of the stuff that comes from the apple X is from Samsung and LG. Meaning the iPhone X is not even made from apple except the design and the rest of the 10%. And your debating about which one is better. They are both phones technically made from Samsung so chill out.\n\ndual camera and face recognition -from LG Innotek\n3D flash memory - from Samsung electronics. made from SK Hynix which is another Korean company\nbattery - from LG Chem.  with Samsungs SDI\nOLED display -from Samsung Display and negotiating with LG currently \nPCB -from Samsung electronics\nother parts from BHI which is also a Korean company.
android had all these things like 2 yrs ago I think
Is the x for xpensive
If someone grabs ur phone and pointed it at u, u probably wanna keep ur eyes closed 😑😑 😂😂😂😂😂\n\n\n🏃🏃🏃😲😲🙍🙈🙈🙈🙈
X gon' give it to ya.
So what if my wife wanna know if I'm texting to other girls and she opens up my eyes as I'm asleep? Lol and what if I need to screenshot?
So someone steals your phone and points it at you and you're going to keep your eyes closed.  Riiiiiight.
Definitely don't want this phone
You can scan someone's face while they sleep -_- Good Job Apple
So they decided to copy the Galaxy S8, which is a rip off an LG, how lazy
what if i get a haircut or something??? the face id wont work
Next they're gonna get rid of the cameras, then the apps, then the screen, then the operating system. The iPhone 14, its literally just a brick
My birthday's in November... I know what I'm not getting!
Hate to say it..but I'm not that impressed.
I swear to god, if i see Techrax with one of these  will have a nervous breakdown.
I legit couldnt stop laughing. Expect the next iphone in about 3 weeks. But serious why cant people just move on? let the iphone die already.
This is a piece of crap overall.
I like how they still dont have a headphone jack
So all my girlfriend has to do to unlock my phone is make fake eyeball cut-outs put them  on my eye lids while I'm sleep and presto !!! she's in my phone 😖 no thanx Apple
Their is no iPhone 9 cause seven eight nine.. get it ;)
I'm sorry but if you pay that much money for a freaking phone you're insane or flat out retarded. Luckily for Apple many people are both.
Whos read X with 'eks' not 'ten'? 😂😜
iPhoneX or IPhone 10?
dey skip 9
https://youtu.be/MiNzABH6MCk
Still shows fingerprints... 2017 ppl...
Hehe
Nice manly hands. :)) Porky pig

The design seems mildly infuriating.

Congratulations apple, you played yourself.
Bhai bhai sakhat
Bassicaly a counter intuitive galaxy s8

MMMMMMMMMMMMMM
iPhone Xtremely ripping off galaxy.
Where tf is iphone 9 lmao
I laugh everytime i see homie picture @1:23
universal mind control
Headphone jack brah?
2:03
ugly
at least comments aren't disabled on this one. apple disabled their comments lol! \nalso, i guess this is the s8's competition of course?
how many chinese slave labors does it take to make an Iphone x? Also how many suicide nets do they have installed at said slave labor factory?
There is an ad that keeps popping up and prevent me from watching the video. It is unfortunate enough for me to skip this video as I am not going to watch an ad that does not interest me.
What happened to the 9?
So where is the nine they skipped from 8 to 10 good counting apple
So basically the phone is always looking at what I'm doing?
Guess 7 8 9 :/
No home button ? 👎👎
I really don't like that they don't even give us a model with audio port and finger sensor
Samsung is better than apple
This is a bitttt long don't ya think?
Thing is though, TouchID will be back in future versions (under the screen), they didnt include it on this one as the technogy isnt ready. That said, i dont quite understand why they didnt put it around the back like they have on the Samsung phones but my point is TouchID will return.

Please can you give me an iPhone 8 because I want to try it
Time to learn, Apple!\nEgo always comes down. Seem you guys didn't learn from Nokia's experiences.
Autistic will go mad when they notice they skipped the iPhone 9. I know I will...
I'm buying the X. It looks banging
Apple has all these new features targeting younger people when they usually can’t afford it.
ANDROID IS THE BEST 👍
U KNOW WHATS WEIRD \n\n\nIM THE ONLY PERSON AT MY SCHOOL WITH A IPHONE 7+ RN AND IM 11
Apple got nowhere but downhill since Steve Jobs died
1:09:53 comes out with a Mario game
Yeah? My five year old Samsung GS3 has face recognition, wireless charging, and a handful of those other features. Apple is playing catch-up at this point. They're no longer leading in innovation.
Yes I love I phone x and I want to buy but not on this price it's too much 😰😰😰

Apple has always been introducing new mobile features but yes they had also increased the price that is where the problem comes
You could really see that it wasn´t easy for Tim Cook to say all that without starting to cry. So much love for Steve , amazing.
I phone 10 back camera photo shut http://adf.ly/1oBMIl
Girl just like em because it's trendy, but all they do is take a selfie pic and go to social media, well that justify the price hahaha.
never mind about the muslim acid bombs in london,we need to concentrate on a new phone with fuck all new about it.\n👍👍👍👍👍👍
How to make a wireless charger at home\nhttps://youtu.be/fIHkFIiMK_w
Main feature was face recognition but it didnt work even they tried to show people suddenly change  another phone to face recognition but iphone was already unlock ha ha failure one-......
I'll stick to Galaxy's. There is NO WAY on earth that I am forking over $1k for a phone when there's better things to do with it like, um, I dunno, SAVE! Nice try apple.

https://youtu.be/kUShnjBm15E watch this video you will like it.
Ok I am going to stop this arguing. Android fans if you don’t like apple stop shitting on the fans, these smart phones are two different things and people have different reasons for having them. For example Apple is faster and better for multi tasking, but android is becoming more innovative and they allow more customization, which some Apple fans don’t really care about, also android has more battery but that is mostly for people who are not on there phone 24/7 all day. And so what if android has more apps, the reason Apple has less is because they don’t allow crappy apps into their store. So that is all and if you have anything to add feel free but try not to shit all over Apple fan boys for liking what they like.
Apple is not good
I love apple \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEspecially when they're crunchy

can someone PLEASE explain to me why people still buy $999 coasters?????
There could be a nice little advantage to the face recognition. You could unlock your phone with gloves on.😃 but you still need to swipe. 😳😬🤔

alter apple ist so scheiße he bei eurem iphone x video da sprechen sie nicht einmal deutsch. Ihr seit so reich, dass ihr euch locker einen deutschen sprecher leisten könnt. Und dann habt ihr auch noch die kommentare ausgemacht, habt ihr etwa angst vor hate? Hat der kleine steven jops etwa Angst vor hatern? Und was soll daran auch so toll sein am iphone x? Es ist der reinste technik scheiß. Wer braucht so einen high teck scheiß mit gesichtserkennung und solche emoticons? Schrecklich ist das. Da muss man sich fragen wann die ersten roboter kommen. Wenn ich so einen scheiß roboter von euch in die finger bekomme zerstöre ich den.

LOVE this video!!! Those B&BW candles are my favorites! I can't resist them when I pass the store
This video is what I've been waiting for! Fall and casey holmes!?!? A dream! My 13 hour day at work is over and every break i got i watched part of this video it got me thru a rough day!
19:52 isn't long!!!!!!! Lol love ya girl 😁
I loved this! Also another fall must have would be hazelnut coffee creamer 😂 strange I know .. but I really think you should continue doing these !
I love old school youtube! You should do a fall clothing try-on.
15 on trending! You go girl! You're one of the only beauty YouTube I still trust and love. Much deserved
i love your makeup in this! especially the eyeshadow ❤️
The Cinnamon Spiced Vanilla candle from Bath and Body Works smells just like arroz con leche. It gives me all the feels of being in a mexican house in the winter. Lol.
Lol her nail fell off on her right pointer finger.
Luv this video......we need one for every season! Or every month!
Next time you go to bath and body works try the rose water & ivy scent & the macintosh apple! Such great scents 😍
Do a fall look book!
Old Navy last year had olive booties! Hopefully they will bring them back again 👍🏻
Loved this video & would love to see more like it!! Definitely going to try the Loccitane body butter!
Always trending! Keep up the great work! Many blessings 😊
PS.  I ❤ that you talk about F21 in the same breath as Stuart Weitzman...too many people only talk about designer when many can't afford it.  Kudos!
I just wore my black one to... urgent care😂
Casey, I have rosacea and I use the topical treatment called Mirvaso (an Rx).  It reduces redness upon application.  So you apply it every morning and then your redness will reduce dramatically within 5-10 minutes.  I've been using it for over 2 years and I am obsessed with it. I'm  not sure if you've tried it yet but I just thought I would let you know!!
I immediately went out and bought the red liquid catsuit after watching this video, only to come home and realize I already bought the same one from the last time you mentioned them 😂
You're setting unrealistic beauty goals for young women. Please remove these videos this is disgusting does everyone have to do this to feel beautiful.
Hey, qvc has a today's special value at midnight tonight and guess what it is ? Barefoot dreams.
Old Navy has the PERFECT olive bootie!!!
https://youtu.be/36jPIdNntcw tell me the difference
Did anyone else laugh out loud when she mentioned getting her blister checked out?! 😂
QVC is having a Todays special value at midnight tonight of the barefoot dreams cardigans!  I love mine and will probably pick up a couple more!
QVC has the barefoot cardigan in every color on sale right now.
#14 on trending! yay so fricken proud of you casey!!!!! get it gurl
This might sound super bitchy to the world, but I appreciate that you called it Nordstrom because that is its correct name. I have abused it a lot in the past, but I'm a stickler for accuracy, so I am also going to call it Nordstrom because that is correct. Thank you!
This video is #14 On trending!!!!!!! Love you ❤️❤️❤️
Youre gonna have such a shock with the New York fall weather, its COLDDDD lol.

That Game of Thrones reference tho 👌🏼
So I ended up ordering that NARS blush in the same shade, the Sephora warm pro pallete and the tanning mouse. I can't wait to try it all! Thanks for the trustworthy advice!❤️❤️
whats the song playing in the end? i tried to Shazam it but no results showed up :(
Girl, I found olive booties at Francesca's today!

The Bath and Body candles are half off right now through the weekend I believe. And if you get their coupons in your email, there is a $10 off $30 coupon too!
When you were in the Bath and body Works did you smell the rose candle?! When we came out with it I instantly thought of you and bought it because it smells so good❤️😁

Casey honestly no matter how many youtubers I watch no one compares to your personality and your content and how great your videos are. Thank you for letting us into your life!!!
Love you girl please can you tell me your lip combo it looks amazing ❤️
Please please please do a Fenty beauty review and wear test!! I would so appreciate it!
The Aphrodite palette by Bad Habit is only 10.00 and is the bomb, it's a dupe for the Huda Palette. I got it today and  am impressed
Can you do a fall outfit look book?? !!!!
Girl I love fall, candles, dogs and basically everything you talk about so idk why were not best friends already! lol
Sth about the audio bothers me but i don't know what.. kind of sounds too much like a studio if you know what i mean. No noise, no echo, nothing 😂🙈
At my bath and body works right now they have $12 candles plus $10 off $30 so 3 candles for $26!
Thanks for highlighting his talent. I always wondered about him. Never understood why he was in films and tv shows.
WOW...this was not a paid advertisement at all!
you don't consider Bill Burr a famous comedian !
I don't see a sophisticated joke, I see a guy just having a kinda funny dad joke punchline, and then just making up a bunch of shit in the middle. Pretty fucking awful
Norm you know damn well you don't belong on the trending page in 2018...but damn it you're my favorite anyway...enjoy your has browns hank chuckowksi...
Interesting style (the handwritten thing)
I heard he's a real jerk!
Thank god for the hatchery.
he's the funniest man of all time
Please add subtitles to your videos, my english lessining is not so good. \nHello from Brazil!
Isn't Mike Tyson's Mystery Tea a shaggy dog story
First vhs I ever purchased was dirty work
Thank God for the Hatchery!
You can't talk me into thinking someone is funny. Patrice O'Neal, now he was Funny! Maybe even an actual comedic genius.
I have never thought he was funny but that moth joke was! \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
Fantastic video! Produced exceptionally well. And, about one of my favorite comics. 5/5
why don't just suck norm macdonalds dick already
I'm so fucking fed up of being mediocre.
So Norm is basically a french canadian comedian...good to know :)
Norm and Prestige are my two favourite things of all time. I approve this channel - subscribing now.
You've become quite adept at exposing the nuances of comedians jokes; how long before you start revealing magicians tricks?\nAlso, congratulations on how professionally formulaic your pauses and emotional cues are.
PLEASE WATCH MY VIDEOS . ILL BE CLIMBING MOUNT EVEREST SOON AND WOULD APPRECIATE SOME SUB SCRIBERS to join me onmy trip through nepaul
It's true he despises meta-comedy or anti-comedy but he still dabbles on occasion. I remember on the Sports Show he had he told one of the best meta jokes I've ever heard (and I'm no fan of the genre myself either) when he said: the producers tell me I have to tell more meta jokes, so... there ya go. after that one, which is pretty much perfect, I knew I never needed to hear a meta joke again because that's got to be as good as they can get.
i don't think he's kidding about the murders
I read this title and thought to myself You're goddamn right he is
Jesus christ the last thing i wanna hear is someone try to explain why something is funny:(
Rolling Stone did an article somewhat recently ranking every SNL cast member in history, and Norm ended up near the bottom of the list. That was the last Rolling Stone article I ever read.
My favorite Norm joke is actually when Olympic snowboarder Gretchen Bleiler was on Conan (Nov. 25th, 2009) setting up a clip of a *very difficult* trick she was attempting to do. Conan played the clip and it showed a huge wipeout. When the clip ended and the camera came back to the guests, Norm said: That actually looked kinda easy. I haven't stopped laughing.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akslq2T7Kfg
Norm is the funniest man alive and  quite likely who ever lived.
i dont understand why people need a whole video analyzing why something is good
Norm is comedy's mad god.
Using the moth joke on Conan was great. It was the joke that made me love him and look forward to everything he did on Conan.
I've never been so excited to click a Nerdwriter video, and to have my all-time favorite joke, Norm's telling of The Moth Joke featured throughout, I'm ecstatic.
The 12 minute joke is basically British stand up format
What's the music at the end???
Dang you already got 257,000 views. Norm is timeless! This is by far the best analysis of Norm Macdonald's comedy.
No mention of Norm's comedic timing? His timing is ridiculously spot on.
Hate channels like this. Go make something yourself. Stop piggybacking on greatness
Thank you for making this.
I met this man In a 5 star hotel lounge in Zurich
Thanks to you, I'll give this dude another try
good video but the moth joke is completely lost when it's cut it into several 20-second segments
He reminds me of Stewart Lee. Everyone give him a YouTube. He's very clever.
Norm Macdonald is one of the funniest people I know. Discover one of his finest moments of genius, and watch him purposely bomb using pre world war II jokes on the Bob Saget roast while all the other comedians are completely losing it.
OK, I have to admit. I watch your video and think Well? Why I will like if I didn`t know or like this Norm-guy? Beside, you didn`t defend him very well, look like he is bad comic  guy that you like and want to justify that to someone. So. I go watch some think of this fellow and, man... Hilarious. Then, I return to like your video. Thanks.
Norm who? Don't you mean Turd Ferguson?
That fucking medieval guitar in the background tho... great vid nonetheless
If you ever bury someone make sure to do it in a coffin
He's brilliant... Like a good friend
Norm macdonald is the comedians comedian.
I always loved Norms comedy since I was a child. So simple yet intriguing, always with a punchline.
Was that conga line joke supposed to be subversive?
If I was a girl,  I would flash him at his stand up shows.
It's weird to know that he voices a talking pigeon on the Mike Tyson Mysteries show. Then again, it totally makes sense.
In other words the guy was a real jerk.
you didnt mention his book!! Based on a true story: a memoir (recently changed to based on a true story: NOT a memoir cuz new york times apparently dont even read the books they rate and categorize (they placed it in non-fiction biography even though it's obviously not actually a memoir. i mean he does heroin with LorrenMicheals and talks to the devil for gods sake obviously it's fiction (sorry i think i overused parentheses (its a bad habit!) ) ) )
i just went through a Norm MacDonald phase a couple weeks ago. Good shit
Thank you for this. You have to include the exchange after the punchline though. Conan: so Norm... Norm: What?
Nerd writer is a video essay genius
Norm McDonald is a fukking White Wing asshole who should be jailed. Listening to that low life pig makes my skin crawl.
His joke about the two kinds of cliff diver ranks amazingly high on my list of all time best short jokes. Dirty work was awesome as well.
His best content is in interviews with radio shows, talk shows, etc. I think he only made one special.
Can we get a Nerdwriter on Comedy series?
As soon as I see my notifications, my light was on.
great video as always , can you make a video about George Carlin please
If you are a fan of Norm  two favorites not referenced here available on   YouTube are Norm Saves the Interview and his segment on the Roast of Bob Saget. The latter is so great because his reading lame jokes off a cue card is clearly calling Bob a sell-out for doing schlock like America's Funniest Home Videos without ever mentioning it.
Thank you Nerdwriter.. i didn't know this guy... laught my ass off... greetings from germany!
Thank you for linking the Bob Saget roast, I haven't seen that in a few years and I forgot how perfect and amazing it was!! There are only two kinds of people in the world: those who think Norm MacDonald is a comic genius and those who are wrong.
His work as Pigeon for Mike Tyson Mysteries is out of this World hilarious.
the light was on.  hahahaha brilliant
Well done for being on trending 😊
I was just watching reviews of mother! and it really seems like a movie you'd like. It'd be interested in your opinion and analysis of said film.\n\nAlso, I want to say thanks for the videos. My view on movies has changed has changed significantly because of them. I just watched Vertigo because of your analysis of the seen in the office at the beginning.
I have to be honest, I dislike his style of humor. Not because it isn't (eventually) funny, or because he's too hard to understand, but because it meanders so much. Plus, frankly, if I'm in the mood to watch stand-up, I'm probably not in the mood to overthink it. I'd rather just relax and hear a joke that isn't making me use deductive reasoning or pay close attention in order to get the full force of the punchline. I'm bored two minutes in. That may just be my short attention span at work, but yeah... his comedy just isn't for me.
Norm owns but explaining why he is funny is awful
I would like to see a video examining the execution of blackface in Tropic Thunder.
He also plays the dog in Dr Dolittle and death in Family Guy
Mike Tyson mysteries is the best
So glad to see Norm getting some love
Gonna watch this again in half A hour while eating A apple.
I still don't know why he'd be considered a comic genius.
OMG! Norm is the best!
Listening to this after Goodnight Moon's latest video fucked me up.
One of Canada's biggest gems. Total comedian's comedian.
Norm is also not a holocaust denier
Great Comedian from Canada? Great lakes maybe.
I like his Professor of Logic Joke - look for it on youtube if you haven't seen/heard it :D
Do a talk about George Carlin
Hiii ! It's Veronika! 🌻
norm is god.
Norm: 9/11 HAHAHAHA
this is pretty pretentious
Normie Normie Normie..
Norm McNaldo
He's disturbing
Normies McDonald's
DO George Carlin!!!!!!
Norm saves the interview.
Help my channel grow

This was on radio 1 only way a find this song was by shazam , im glad a did

Just when i was losing hope on modern mainstream dance music this banger pops up (Jamie XX LAD)
wow ! jamie you are so ...
Thank you Jamie for all the music you make it honestly makes my day 100x better! I love you Jamie, Romy, And Oliver you guys are the best!
Listened to this during his boiler set, truly stunning! Check it out if you haven't already
I love how basically all he did was use the ambience and bass of the original and its still sick
when is this going to be on spotify? :'(
With the new release of their new album and their Glastonbury set this year. The XX have been the soundtrack to my summer.
You're the fucking man Jamie.
Hmmmm damn this tracks pure bliss. The XX and Jamie haven't made a single bad song or track 🤗👐👐
Don't mind me, just here before this explodes! 😅
Where does it stop, where does it stop\nWhere do you dare me to (draw the line)?\nYou've got the body, you've got the body\n\nDare me to, dare me to\n\nWhere does it stop, where does it stop\nWhere do you dare me to (draw the line)?\nYou've got the body, you've got the body\nYou've got the body, you've got the body

Can't say I thought I would see dabbing in an xx video 😅
man this is some great editing! mesmerizing to watch! would love to see the editline for this

Finally! Best part of his Boiler Room Reykjavik set in my opinion
jamie xx makes me love life.
Heartd Jamie play this on Jamie xx Boiler Room Reykjavík DJ Set, and 2 days later they release it officially. Great!
such a good remix
This makes me wanna go travelling again! 😍😍 amazing
Best song in his reykjavik boiler room set...
If i get it right a clip by Alasdair McLellan is young and beautiful people kissing each other all day long... all the time ? And partying on this one
I've been listening to you guys from the beginning and knew you'd blow up one day!!!! I love and adore your music! It's gotten me through dark times and made the bright times seem infinite! THANK YOU AND NEVER STOP, PLEEEASE!!!!
my head is about to explode from this perfect masterpiece, Jamie xx I fucking love you
wich software do they use? to edit the videos
Jamie xx can make the already good songs sounds even better. Such a genius!
It shouldn't never end...
i want a jamie remix of EVERY xx song... #dream <3
i liked it BEFORE i heard it ...
1:59 when the beat drop ! GENIUS!
DAMN THIS REMIX IS SO GOOD!!!! Jamie is the best!!!
The time of minute 2 is sublime, awesome thanks

September 12 is my birthday. September 13 Jamie XX released this. Best present ever.
This version though..... 😍it's Remixalicious
Been waiting for this since the Iceland boiler room 🌋❄
After listen to this, I just want another Jamie xx album. In colour is a master piece.
What are they drinking?
this is really really nice
I miss being a teenager...
Jamie xx's music makes me want to close my eyes and start dreaming, the man can do no wrong
I´M IN LOVE WITH THE XX!!! <3

Well this is a load of fucking shite.
Would have been better if that guy never opened his mouth
I know they are your friends and sutff, but you should focus more on solo stuff. This is another lever stuff, so good. When new Jamie xx lp?
I thought the original song was a Jamie xx remix 😂
RIP EDM.
I don't like this one, my brother just flushed the toilet so the pop tarts are ready. Sorry Grace (😂😂😂)
you look like the Riddler in the green suit... but you still look good, how dare you
My school started back in August 25. lol
Rock Princess Grace tho. More of this, please!
Omg that first one got me xD
If anyone was wondering what outfit no.5 was, it's called a 'Birthday Suit'. You can get it from your mother completely free of charge and it's guaranteed to fit you forever!
I would date every one of these outfits
I love the adidas from the flirty and quirky look, and this is at least the second time I've gone a long expedition to find them. still coming up with nothing.
I just remembered my grandmother died in this shirt. She got it made at a kiosk in the mall. It's a picture of my dad.\n\nYour dad is Gene Simmons \n\nWhat? No. \n\nMy favorite exchange between Grace and her boy.
The second outfit is totally heather duke
In the beginning she looks like a teacher.... Teach me hard ! Very very hard 😎😍(I'm jk...maybe I'm not, nope defiantly not jk)
What's your profession, getting the pig of gold at the end of the rainbow?? Love you an tho💜
If more girls would have dressed like the last example I never would have graduated...at least that's the excuse I could have used.
Your 'Professional' look is something I'd support 6 days of the week and twice on Sunday! Love the video and keep truckin'!? I don't know...
Downloads of my YouTube de-pixilation   add-on increased five fold
the green suit.. i love the riddler
Who else was super here for Rock Princess Grace? Ooh girl, looking cute!
he never came back
I really liked this video and I oddly actually got outfit ideas? I think this is your best beauty/fashion meets comedy video yet.
One day I'll click on these Grace fashion videos and realize THERE IS NO FASHION IN THEM!
Goose looks great in every style.
I wear outfit #5 under all my outfits!
this lightning is tha bomb grace. ✨✨✨
I like this new length of hair on you Grace
What brands are these from because I might want to get something similar
Wellllll give chester his pants back, then.....you know..the next time you drop goose off with him.
Did she break up with Chester ?
Literally none of those outfits adhered to my school's dress code and that's what I loved most abt this video ♡
School used to be the place young people frequented to gain skills for future endeavors, and to achieve the highest academic mastery possible.  It appears now school is where you ...lie about who you are... - which happens to be a critical talent for corrupt politics and future relationships.   Like, I'm like, totally, like... you know, like I mean, like, yeah.
This reminds me of a Marina Joyce look book mixed with an early 90s instructional video.
I bet you a trillion dollars that I can find those shoes that Grace wore for the pant suit outfit in my moms closet
I need that sweat shirt.
can you make a video on how to make friends? I need some desperately :'D
For a moment I was like wait what Grace with a serious fashion video and then ooohh hahahah
OMG Grace in the green suit gives me lifeeee she's gorgeous!
The photo angles made me mildly nauseous​... Is that what you were going for, Grace?
Who is holding the camera tho' ?
I liked this video
Grace you crack me up! This was sexier than I expected. I like surprises.
Grace is the ultimate beauty/lifestyle vlogger let's be real here
that green outfit is EVERYTHING
This was super funny!
I can't believe that I saw this incredible human at VidCon Australia a week ago!
OOOOOOOO GUUUUURRRRRRRRLLLLL YAS GURL! You WORK that GREEN PANTSUIT!!!!!!! Just curious, where'd you get it?
School holidays just started in Melbourne I believe, for some, or most, or I have no idea.\nYup that green pant suit is amazing.\nThe KISS outfit, Rodeo Drive, cute!\nNever stop making makeshift tripods.\nDat last outfit.
Further proof Grace can literally pull off anything...or nothing! TBH, I would wear all of these but the last one.
This has to be the best thing I've ever seen 😂❤️
are you a professional, leprechaun?
I went back august second 😭
the second outfit looks like something Sailor Uranus would wear so I was immediately questioning if I was attracted to Grace in it.
Even your slightly dying or mostly dead purple flower thought that your 70's substitute teacher cosplay was depressing.
Ok but the rock princess is so cute
Everybody should go to school naked. They can't suspend/expel the entire school. Can they?
I like the very very last one,damn funny block things.
Grace's hair is so dang cute!!
You have pretty hands.
I was wondering why there was only 4 outfits in the thumbnail...
Ok but I like that the outfits (except 5) were like semi serious but done in a very grace way
I wish I could like this 5 billon times, was amazing
i have been in school for five (5) weeks and have worn the same hoodie non stop, i obviously wash it and have different shirts underneath but no one knows that because i never take it off and to top it off i always wear black jeans so basically im a cartoon character
My school holidays are in a week
i'm leaving a comment
This is so funny. I am subscribing to Grace Helbig.
Okay but why is she actually gorgeous in anything and everything haha.
I wonder if Graces mom ever thought that her daughter would be paid to wear green pant suits online for 3 Million people?
0:36 When you realize you have a hand.
I just love u sista
I feel weird. Love that merch
She's beauty, she's Grace, she's Miss United States

When you wear a uniform
Oh my goooooosh!!!! You're not a doctor. I'm still laughing! Grace cracks me up!!!!!

i like this
She so fabulous
Ahhh! Grace, you look so great 😍
Fake in pula mea
Vince is Vince , even at 72 , he is still super fit . Blood patch on the forehead ? Seen Vince take way more punishment than this . He is looking for sympathy . About time we had the attitude era back . Will Vince be the guest referee ? In the Shane/Owens match ?
Vince McMahon is a tough guy who is willing to hurt himself for the company. Massive respect. Also, I hope we get no haters for Owens vs. Shane like AJ vs. Shane did.
If you pause it at 2:31, you can see the Vaseline/makeup on Vince's forehead perfectly.
Something Tells me that Kevin's gonna get fired if he loses
In truth, Vince is more ripped than Owens.
Though KO has won the Universal title but he truly now is in the big leagues.
That looked brutal. I hope Mr. McMahon is ok...geez
Typical feud when a wrestler gets involve the authority just waiting to see whose best
Still Stone Cold can do better than that.
Did the headbutt cut him, or did he cut himself, because Owen's for head didn't even get red.
not one singe lawsuit lost? Get the f out vince...
that money hungry old creep ...will probably  die with a dollar in his hand
wat's next for kevin
That was actually a real headbutt, not a headbutt like wrestlers usually do while putting their other hand on their head first then doing the headbutt.
vince is a savage
He should be fired!!!!!  No one likes you Kevin Owens
He had it coming.
I'm still waiting for #smackdown1000.. #ThunderSmackdown
Now this is the way WWE needs to be this is what will bring the fans back more than ever i was so excited when i seen this i mean VINCE MCMAHON is a BEAST 72 YEARS OLD and still taking huge bumps way to go VINCE & KEVIN OWENS nicely done got me really ecxited for next weeks smackdown...
I was hoping triple h to come out right behind Stephanie.
I don't understand how they can pop for the Whole Once stuff, some of that Promo was was Heel talk. Ridiculous if they're trying to make the McMahons Faces Especially Steph. BTW, Vince loved that headbutt.
Kevin Owens has been involved in 2 legendary segments this year
KO should be an anti-authority figure like Stone Cold. It fits his look & demeanor. You should have him doing crazy stuff on a weekly basis to the McMahon family. It worked in the late '90's and early '00's, it'd work now. \n\nWWE needs to get back to structuring its shows like the past two weeks of SDL. You carried this story throughout the ENTIRE shows, paying the first week off with a cliffhanger that made people want to see what would happen the following week, then they tuned it and you strung this throughout the show and paid it off at the end. That's how wrestling was structured when it was at its very best and most popular. If WWE can do that, do more of it, remain consistent, then they'll do a lot better.
Kevin Owens has got NO CHAAANCE to beat Shane o'mac
Kevin Owens has really pushed it with the McMahon family now. First, he insults Shane and gets attacked by Shane. Shane is suspended because of Owens, then Owens attacks his father and pisses off his younger sister.What next? Linda McMahon returning to help deal with this?
Triple H confronts Kevin Owens... it wont happen but GOD that would be one heck of a slobber knocker
Mr Mcmahon should quit, he got his butt kicked like 1,000,000 times
M It's millionaire lol
Guess What Stephanie you are next meaning something is going to happen to her *she going to have something the kids don't want to see that everyone wants to see her breast*
Let's be honest Kevin Owens found out the leaked plans for Wrestlemania 34 and wanted Vince to forget about it
Si kevin owens lis se message je veux lui dire qui va se faire virer est ses biens fait il fallait pas chercher m mecmahon
that superkick was vicious
Stephanie is bad af!!!!!! 😻 #Body
Fire kevinOwnen'ns
Boooooooooooooo
where damm is brock and the real warriors? what is this garbage? the fatest guy vs the oldest ? dammm wwe go down with this kind off shows
well now there's a different kind of b\n next to McMahon's name boot
Stephanie (jealous) aligns with Kevin Owens against Shane; Kevin is the new face of the franchise.
he's so fired
ahahahahaah
Savage
what if he hit Steph
3:10 Wasted
kevin owens is bs
Yay Ko go
жду возвращения Triple-H!
How
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcZzlPGnKdU
Savage Mr.VinceMcmahon
I enjoyed this
vince mcmahon still has it with the promo game
Kevin Steen busted Vince McMahon open... what a time to be alive.
God damn Vince can still cut a promo.
You know you've made it big, when Mr. McMahon is willing to sacrifice himself to you, to give you a push.
So did Vince fine himself 100k for this
Vince took that like a champ
Wow, this is some of best stuff in wwe I've seen in awhile. Second from cena and reigns epic segment they did recently. Vince, 72 years old taking bumps like a ecw guy and on top of that,  still built like Greek god lol
So this was just a shoot promo directed at CM Punk?
the match should be Owens vs Shane and TripleH in hell in a cell
That's not a brutal attack.
This is the KO I have been waiting to see. Vicious and ruthless.
why is the crowd so dead all the time
I love Stephanie
be cool if shane came out a beat up kevin
This was a 100% real headbutt I could tell as soon as I saw it , it's a bit fake because headbutts are aimed to break noses , forehead to forehead will cause blood and a headache , well played vince
The headbutt connected HARD! - the blood wasn't from the headbutt however... slow mo'ing the video vince is holding a blade in the hand that is holding the microphone, then when he is on his back you'll see the grip in the hand that moves across his chest. But I physically saw the blade.
You know your important when Mr McMAHON does a segment with you. Vince is great on the mic...
Great headbutt! He laid that one for real...
Does Stephanie have a Beyonce starter kit or something
I'd like Kevin more if he didn't look like some hillbilly dad.
i was crying so much when I saw this on TV. It is ferral and moronic to attack ANYONE. Kevin Owen can die in a hole
We still do not know who threw the pie at Kevin Ownens' face...
Vince takes more Bumps than cena & roman combined.
vince is better to sell promos then roman reigns :)
Kevin has no patience hence he's got no company.....lol
Fack you owens
Probre McMahons😨
V-K-M...70+Y-E-A-R-S...BETTTER T-H-A-N EVVVEEER 24/7=)!!!
fire that stupid ugly pig!
I HEAT KEVIN
Orton did it better
TV-14 return?
Ecw
Lol
KILL STEEN KILL!!!
Fake as hell
Plz let stephine slap him
Fire Owens Fire!
RAW Comissioner is on SmackDown
Shane mcmahon should not get suspended
Well CM Punk, did you get it?
You stupid kavin!
Macmohan family attacked by the monsters created by them. They r slave of their own creation. After all the money they stuffed in their bank accounts mcmahons got nowhere to run nowhere to hide. They will die taming the monsters created by them. Linda dont come Triple always remain unhealthy and Shane cannot take the burden of running the WWE. Responsibilty remain on stephnie shoulders to keep the company to the heights where it is now. Triple H dont have a son. Time will tell which family member get how much share when Vince die.
Vince is 71 and Kevin Owens has laid a frog splash? \nMan, Kevin Owens has lost his damn mind!
Sorry Vince, you're not a billionaire. You're a millionaire who should be a billionaire.
First an F5 from\nBrock lesnar now\nThe head butt to\nKevin owens.\nWhay the Heck is\nGoing on?
That's gotta be the first time we've seen Stephanie on TV since Wrestlemania. Am I wrong?
*NOO*
vince lost a lawsuit thats why the company name is wwe not wwf

Lpyjuhukmm\n\nJlo
I had an ad for Ancestory before this XD
anybody else notice that Emma was on STV news? no? ok
I could've guessed all that from your nose alone
Your DNA test says yes you are a FREELOADER!!! Stop having people pay your bills LOOSER!!!!!
Okay, so... like I can't afford to do that, but from what you've found out we share a LOT in common. The preference for salty over sweet, freckles everywhere, ring finger longer than index, green eyes that aren't quite green.\n\nClearly we're separated-at-birth twins despite my being nearly an entire year older than you and only 25% European at best
Everyone who subscribes to the channel has a 1000 year love of their mother's father and their family and everything they want\nall you have to do is to have a cannon bone and smile
She must be pretty thick to think she was completely British
Broadly Northwestern European doesn't necessarily mean Scandinavian though. It just means that the DNA could be from any northwestern European area including British & Irish, but it can't be confirmed for sure. It's more likely that that assignment is British and Irish instead of Scandinavian considering her already high British and Irish results.  \n\nMore info on the broadly assignment:\nhttps://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/212186038-Broadly-assigned-and-Unassigned-ancestry
Now that you mention it, I do see the neanderthal.
The asparagus thing is if your pee smells bad after you eat asparagus
I'm never gonna die!\n\n*hits Emma with train*\n\nJk I would never do that..\n\nI would hit her with asparagus instead :D
My family tree has been laid out on my mother's side for generations. Her family came to America from Germany in 1845. When I first got my Ancestry DNA test results, they didn't mention Germany at all! Then I noticed the results were derived from the information they gather about their other customers. So it is rather like going to a fortune teller 🔮 😂
Did she find out that she's white?
I got I got I got I got black man skin and white man skin inside my DNA
YOU WERE FEATURED IN THE APPLE SPECIAL
DNA results come in:\nYour ancestry determines you're likely to start a YouTube channel.\n\nP.S. Your test is free if you make a video about this test.
Adult humans are infact not supposed to drink milk by default thus your body wouldn't naturally produce the enzyme to deal with it. However if u've continually drunk it from childhood ur body has retained the production of that enzyme. So when u stop for a prolonged period your body sorta forgets coz it's not a default enzyme for adults ... thus u have trouble with lactose after
My top fave youtubers -including lovely Emma of course- have done these test now I'm really curious about doing my own DNA test. :P
i sent mine off about 2 months ago, bloody place takes age the latest said due to the hurricane your results will be delayed, i used my heritage for it and it was on offer at 69 pounds, cant wait to see what it says, as for yours that a lot of Neanderthal you have and very rare, means mostly your family has bread slowly over the 10s of thousands of year and stayed close to England.
Its cool to be Scandinavian? What year is this?
Where does it say you're 14 % scandinavian? The only 14 % is 14 % BROADLY NORTHWESTERN EUROPEAN - which can be anything in North Western Europe. Including the british island, france, germany and scandinavia.
You're an idiot for taking a dna test without truly understanding the implications of the test and its results. There, question answered
You are so comedic! I'm subscribing to you! 😂
Whenever I see you now, I'm just going to think Neanderthal.
It's not only skandinavian you forgot Russia 🇷🇺.........but yeah I'm pretty sure Russia didn't go on raids and...... yup your probably skandinavian .....
Emma, where did you get your shirt, I lovee it! Best wishes from Germany <3
Not to be that person but the broadly Northern European could actually be British still. They just can't pin point what the Northern European is. It doesn't necessarily mean Scandinavia but it's possible
I have been watching Youtubers for years, and now I keep up with a lot less than I use to, but I still keep up with Emma Blackery, and Jenna Marbles because those two just do whatever they feel like doing and its so genuine, and satisfying.
She's like the perfect human
You are aware that North Western Europe includes the UK, Germany and France as well, right? Not just Scandinavia?
The moment I subbed: When I predicted that she was going to say: I'm gonna live forever a second before she actually said it :D
Why does it matter so much if other Youtubers have made a similar video? If you wanna do it, you do it girl. If it's original- okay fab that's great. If it's not original- then okay still fab that's great!
You think that's a lot of freckles?\n\n\nI'm ginger.
Emma ! Take care of a good own house, you will need it for a long time
So we have established that Emma is perfect?
Where do you get the spit test thing from? X
Yup, yes I knew it\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm Swedish
i very much want to do this, but i'd rather not pay £100
Lmao I didn't know some people couldn't smell asparagus.
She's going to be on the news!!!!!!
I got 61% Eastern European Jewish \n18% Iberian (Portuguese dad) \n12% British (lived in London all my life) \n 2% Irish \n2% African\n1> Caucasian
I love your top
2:02 HOW DID YOU KNOW I WAS FROM SWEADEN!!!?
She probably said but where do you do this? I kinda want to find out mine
5:15 sorry Emma, but you are not the first immortal being. There are a few other species on this planet that are biologically immortal, for example: Turritopsis dohrnii, (jellyfish) and Lobsters (Though they could actually die if they fail to molt)
Love you Emma I am Swedish
Ive just posted my first ever video... please can someone watch it and let me know what you think? i was very nervous doing it haha
The whole lactose intolerant thing happens because lactose is broken down by an enzyme in your stomach (basically a little thing that makes reactions happen quicker). As humans we are born with this specific enzyme to break down lactose because we have breast milk when we're babies. \nAs we grow older these enzymes are sometimes no longer produced because we should no longer be consuming lactose. That's why people can become intolerant as they get older. \nThis is also why if you don't eat it for a while you body will no longer produce the enzymes so you become intolerant to it
Are you genetically predisposed to being a regressive?
lol, have you seen this https://youtu.be/1_Ka9uXEEuU i laughed
She said people say she sounds Australian. Not at all😂
Lol I am gunna die very early, thanks bad genes, I eat healthy, I jog a lot, but my parents and grandparents have all the shit and I have more shit than they had at my age lololol.
Emma I have a very real question for you... where did you get that top? Please??? You look like a vampire... possibly... IMMORTAL??! \n\nAlso I'm from Essex too! Was born in southend hospital ^-^ thanks for being you, m'dude. You've made me laugh for the past 5 years and I'm so proud of how far you've come.
Those are some good genes :D
Can I just say I’ve been here before the shoutout from Apple.
Dna: double helix structure... A phosphate backbone with complementary bases\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiology
I didn't know if you give Emma 🥛 she will blow you lol
A lot of freckles...\nEmma: shows a few on her arm.\nMe:  absolutely filled with freckles from down my arms, legs, face and hands.
I'm sure she's had black in her
Enma: Likely to consume more caffeine... Not with my anxiety levels! \nMe: IT'S ME
I am going to live forever \nHaha 😂😂 we're okay with that
Not a carrier? Then who brings your groceries places? It's not me, is it? That would be weird if I didn't know that.
That last line will be just dripping with dramatic irony 80-100 years from now.
Australians and Brits are the exact same because all Australians were derived from the British people on the First Fleet that arrived in Australia in the 1800's.
Nordic, not scandinavian lol. Finland was on the list: it's a part of the Nordic countries but not a Scandinavian country
You call that a lot of freckles?! Lol you should we my brother, he's more freckle than white
I actually went and researched on Neanderthals, fairly interesting. Turns out that they were very smart!
I didn't know it also showed your likelihood for terminal and horrible illnesses. I need to do this now lol
I'm a niggee
and then i just didn't exist😂😂😂😭

This is so scientifically inaccurate that it is making me want to kill myself

Shoulda just put clothes on the floor.

This is exactly what i experienced when i was little!
I see community all over this 😁
How the heck you choke on a s'more.
Why is the video so loud
Omg guys it's been ages
Lol somehow I was expecting the ending but I still loved it
I miss this type of content on YouTube, well done guys
Why?  Why did you make me feel, and then take it all away?

THE FLOOR IS LAVA!\n\nMe:i hate life\n\n*flops on floor*

Ever think you guys have too much fun with these? :P
And they say there is no quality content on YouTube
Why are you throwing more clothes at him he will burn
Lets do this together! *jumps in the lava
Use to play the game the floor is all lava. Avoid the floor at all cost.
That'll be me in my first apartment

I hate my life
This is actually super emotional 😂

How to surf on lava. \n*step 1*\nThrow your friend into the lava.\n*step 2* \nRide on him to escape.
I have to be up by seven!!!
This is a classic
That part where the guy with the glasses fell in the lava was a total take off of this is the end when jay and Seth are going up to heaven
So fake! This a waste of my time
I cried a little
Lava is more dense then humans so if we fall in lava we would float on the top and be toasted
I have to be up by sevven, the way he said 7 cracked me up
I wish Brett was still a regular on the Sam and Niko videos 1:28
Don't play floor is lava at 3AM\n[GONE WRONG] [SO SCARY]
the alarm clocks time changes at the beggining if the video
How could there be sirens if the floor was lava
Love it! Blew me away when it was just a dream.
If the floor was lava, they would probably all die of heat exhaustion and would burn to death because of how close they are to lava
Scientific research shows that Brett can't go 5 minutes in a conversation without saying the word son
If you pause at 1:02 you can see the thumbs up from terminator
But why was he floating in lava
*The floor is commenting on peoples comments*

Didn't Vox do kind of a similar video about the Mona Lisa, and how it only really became famous after it was stolen? Or am I thinking of another channel?
Calling some of the world's most beloved art overrated? It's a bold move, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off for 'em.
I didn't see any overrated factoids...just factoids. Good video, but bad marketing.
It's because it's one of the few entertaining books you read in English class in almost all schools (Not one of the few good books, entertaining.) the other ones I can think of are The Great Gatsby and Lord of the Flies.
What are you saying? Just because To Kill a Mockingbird got lucky at the time of its release, that makes it less brilliant? A book can be brilliant and get lucky with the time of its publishing, too. Its luck doesn't make it any less amazing.
Just how stupid this guy thinks Vox's audience is to feel like he needs to explain what El Dorado is. That's insulting
0:40 I question his math.
now let's look at catcher in the rye
The book was terrible
Why is this thrown in my suggestions that I can't rid of? It's popped up three times. All I can is report. I've never watched a Vox video is my life. Why is this here? Why won't it go away?
Attn Vox: You need to deliver on your premise! Is there widespread criticism that this isn't actually a good book? You could have compared how it sold relative to its preceding and follow up Pulitzer price winners... You could have drawn parallels to Jaws, a movie that became the first summer blockbuster partially because of air conditioning being installed in theatres...
I don't like it, not because it's overrated or because I was forced, simply because it's not my style.
It's funny how Atticus Finch has become this symbol of great liberal values when the thing he did in the book was accuse a woman about being raped.
I've never read it
1938, 1944, and 1948 penguins look like they that were ran over  o_O

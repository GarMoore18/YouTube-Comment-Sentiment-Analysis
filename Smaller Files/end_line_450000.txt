Wowwwwwww. This is what Ive been looking for in music these days.
This is like a modern day Wilson Phillips
Those girls are my favorites of all singers
Who else is in love with Danielle’s sassy ass walk though??😍😍😍 easily the best song on the album next to Ready for You and Walking Away
this song is so catchy especially while watching the video, makes you wanna get up and dance 💗
It says something when I hit the like button before the video even started to play.
They are sooo sexy, and so much fun! Love Haim!
This video looks like it was so much fun to film.. xx
Easy, peasy, nice and breezy. Much needed right now. Thanks. 🤞🏼

You'll be an amazing mother regardless of how your baby is fed. People are so judgemental about that topic which I think is madness. I'm a proud bottle fed baby and I turned out fine. Love you Louise xxxxxx
Louise, as much as I think it would be nice to talk about your money and stuff, I don't think it you should tell people about how much you earn etc. You need your privacy too. :3
I know breastfeeding is a an issue for so many but you really have to do what is right for you. With my daughter I had no issues in breastfeeding and loved every minute. With my son I cried in pain every time(he chewed my nipples until they were bleeding). I bought an electric breast pump and expressed until he was 3 months old before switching to formula. Every person is different and the most important thing is a happy and healthy mum and baby x
My mom used to say: money is worse than religion and politics... just don't talk about it bc it's rude
People should absolutely discuss how much they earn, if they feel comfortable doing so, in a straightforward and informative way. The idea that it's rude to talk about money is harmful, I think, because it keeps people from understanding just how unfair the balance of earnings can be within a company or a nation. I think part of the reason it's considered rude to talk about money in the first place is that the highest classes in a society don't want anyone knowing just how filthy, obscenely, terribly wealthy they are.  It's rude for people to ask you outright how much money you make unless it's like a colleague or someone trying to find out how much of a raise they should ask for. But at the same time, it's something we should discuss more openly on the whole.
I recently started watching Call the midwife on Netflix. Its actually really good and its all about life in the 1950s. You might like it Louise (:
I don’t have a problem with people talking about how much they earn. Boasting is different though. X
oooh I do love a good unboxing! I love your enthusiasm, just a small timer looking for a kick start in the youtube world myself x
I love a weekly vlog😊❤️
It's hard to put my finger on where the line is, but with my closest friends I've just felt it's been ok if the information is useful/helpful etc. Like as a recent university grad it's been helpful as we look for and gauge wages for some of our first full time jobs, it been good to gauge what the normal limits are and discuss budgeting, etc. Still a tough topic, but when you understand why it's being discussed and feel the information won't be taken out of context, I can do it.
Just paused to say that even if you were breast feeding, the bottles are a good way for Liam to be involved with feeding too x You do you Louise and don't listen to the few negative people that don't understand your needs. Every parent has their own way and as long as you care and love your child, you are doing the best job in the world x
Your eye makeup in the beginning is stunning!
I've been following you for so many years but truly you being pregnant makes me want to have a baby at some time so much? It's so weird bc I always thought I don't want a baby, my teacher was preggie and my nieces were born and here I am watching your videos thinking oh yeah i want that too it's so weird, but thank you for helping me embrace wanting a baby someday :)
Oh man....in America you are given those bottles for going to the bathroom after delivery while you're at the hospital! I am SO glad you read about it because they're really nice to have on hand! haha
where are the antlers from? so cute :)
I STARTED A PUZZLE CLUB TOO!! but we only did puzzles about two times before it evolved into just drinks, YouTube and maybe a board game. I do my puzzles on my own now 😆
Hey Louise! I had the same issue when I had my daughter. Lost lots of blood during delivery and could never make milk properly. My daughter kept losing weight and I kept getting deeper in post partum depression, and my pediatrician told me that it was time to feed my baby. He said that FED is best. I can't believe it took me 10 days to decide to feed my child, but the pressure to breast feed is VERY REAL! I felt like a failure, but I know now that feeding my baby was the best decision. \n\nHugs! Dana
I feel like if someone wants to disclose how much they earn, that’s cool. And if they don’t want to disclose it, that’s also cool. I do however think it’s rude to ask. I just think it’s a very personal thing to just come out and ask someone, because it’s actually nobody’s business? If I’m having a conversation with someone and it comes up, then I’ll discuss it if I’m comfortable, but I don’t think people should just ask.
Feed is Best! As long as your baby is feed, it doesn't matter the method.
I work in the public sector so google would happily tell you what I earn. Personally I'm all for talking about earnings if not only to inspire the next generation to aim higher but also to create an open culture. I worked for a company that once banned us from talking about earnings until someone let out they earned nearly 4k more than someone else doing the same job!
lovely weekly vlog as always 💜 on the subject of money/earnings, I think that the interest around Youtubers making money and how much has become such a largely speculated thing purely because nobody knows the exact answer. Personally I am not bothered whether or not I ever find out how much that may be, but I will say that I am quite curious about what the roundabout figure is. I'm a naturally nosey person but would never EXPECT this information from anyone
It is good to talk about what you earn in an informative way! xx
I think its interesting with the whole money thing, I personally (and please don't take offence to this) think its a privilege to be able to keep your earnings private. As someone who as worked in the NHS and is now studying to continue my career in the NHS my salary is completely public knowledge, I get why because the taxpayer pays my wage but I don't get the option to be private about what I earn you just need to google it. I think that discussion is the best way to grow, particularly in business, woman tend to be paid a lot less in comparison to their male counterparts for the EXACT same job but often people don't know because we don't discuss it. One of the only industries with no gender pay gap is the NHS(yes there are plenty of problems with NHS pay but this isn't one of them) I personally think part of this is to do with the complete transparency in regards to salary. You are totally within your rights to keep your earnings private and I agree that asking your salary on national TV is totally rude and not ok but general discussion and transparency on money I think is important in equality and in terms of understanding industry.
Don't feel guilty about bottle feeding!!!!  Do you!
It is rude to ask people how much you earn , there’s only 4 people who know how much I earn and they are my mom , dad , my employer and myself!
Such a shame that it is difficult for you to say that you might not breastfeed... Even if you just made the decision not to youre the mum so you know best... always... its a shame as well that it is also other women putting down other women! also s lot of the goodness you produce is in the first 3 days so even if you managed that it would be amazing :) i really hope you manage to do whatever is right for you!
Louise, your words about breast/bottle made me think of this - https://fedisbest.org/
The Little Book of Calm from Black Books
Love Asda/George for bedding. Always have the greatest designs. Going to copy and order my new Xmas ones this week. Would love Halloween bedding but cant find any good ones in the Uk..
As a student, I find it really interesting and helpful to know how other students make money and spend/safe it. It is a topic i frequently talk about with friends/fellow students. I do not see that as rude but as very helpful.
I've been applying for jobs recently and a couple of them in their applications, asked how much i made in my last job. I  didn't particularly like being asked the question as it had nothing to do with the job.
Where was the mrs pots and chip cup from
Can we all please worship Louis's eyeliner it is on point the whole video 👌
I used to use a jug with cooled boiled water when going to the toilet after giving birth
THE LITTLE BOOK OF CALM! Black Books, anyone?
I think it's okay if people are just interested to know how they can make money on line. It's certainly not okay to ask other people how much money they make, or for people to brag about how much they  make😺😺😺😺. The brownies looked really nice. Love the snuggly kittens. Xxx
Giant sacks of cloth.. literally me pregnant or not 😂
Breast feed or bottle feed it's no ones damn business!  Your bub your choice 💕💖.  I thinks it's sooo rude to ask someone how much money they earn. In saying that, (UTUBER)Danielle Mansutti said( I think I have this right) that to work out approx how much utubers get paid per video, take the last two numbers off the views, ie if it's viewed 34650 times, they would get paid about 346 for the video. She also said it depends on the country, US utubers get paid heaps more than Australian ones. It's interesting, but I wouldn't ask or expect to be told.
Haha, my sister and I are starting our ‘Puzzle Club’ on Sunday. Thanks for the idea! ☺️
This may be a weird comment but Louise has perfect lips.
Love your eye makeup with that hair!! So beautiful 😍
I think a persons salary is private xx
It’s a good day when you get excited over seeing a guy you don’t even know just cause of how much hype Louise has made over him 😍😍 am I the only one? Yeah probably idc 😂😂
Please make a fanny prep video soon!😅 Expecting my first baby and need some tips before due date in 6weeks😝
if people are interested for the good reasons (about the  money)  I think it would be interesting to know how do you earn money 😉 not how much, I do think it's impolite
I'd say if you know someone quite well or maybe looking to apply for what job they have, asking what salary someone has is fine but i wouldnt just go around and ask anyone that does feel rude to me. Do a smaller puzzle maybe like 500 piece wouldnt be as much of a challenge😂 I've done a 1000 piece disney princess one a while ago and it was actual hell!
Don't put pressure on yourself to breastfeed, your true subscribers and people within your life will understand whatever you choose to do. It's a personal choice, I have zero intention to breastfeed even though in theory I will be completely capable of doing so.\n\nAlso looking forward to the fanny prep video! \n❤️
I still think it's rude to ask how much money someone makes but there is often a massive divide between viewers and creators which is were the interest comes in, if you're working long hours nearly everyday and come home to watch youtube and see them receiving free gifts and affording the lifestyle some do, it can be frustrating as youtube is perceived to be an 'easy' job, i don't think it is an easy job but some creators/influencers are doing incredibly well compared to say nurses or teachers.
Eating fish and chips and watching Mulan sounds like the perfect night to me!
I wasn’t breath fed and as far as I can tell the only thing that could be criticised about me is I’m socially awkward but I can’t blame my mothers tit for that
your videos always make me feel better, so thank you <3
Whilst breastfeeding is probably preferable, it’s great to be realistic. It’s not for everyone, and it’s great to be prepared for you and babe! Love your vlogs Louise (and the hair is awesome!)
I love your hair colour! 🦄😊💚💛💜💙
I don't see a link to Sarah's book
I have 2 sphynx cats and really get fed up of people saying they are ugly!! They are different for sure but not everyone is the same and i love all cats! Mine are just different!
I'm learning so much about childbirth and motherhood and I'm a 22 year old postgrad student 😂
I agree I think it's incredibly rude to talk about how much you earn. It is no one else's business what you earn. I think because we see youtubers living a very comfortable and sometimes luxury lifestyle people are interested to know how much you make because it seems more attainable than a traditional celebrity and also because it's curiosity isn't it, we have no idea, not even a rough idea, where as most professions you have a rough idea of the salary. But I'm on your side, i wouldn't tell anyone how much money I earn and I'd be offended if anyone felt they had the right to ask x
I bought LOADS of waterwipes. My baby (6weeks old tomorrow) bloody hates them they are sooooo cold. Just a heads up... aldi wipes and nappies are amazing! I started on pampers and waterwipes but didn't like either xx
Why did you do the puzzle like that!? Sort through all the pieces and separate the edges first!
Re Money questions - as a student I find that all my peers are happy to talk about how much they earn/their money situation (e.g. ‘ugh my job only pays £5.30 per hour’ or ‘yay my loan comes in tomorrow’ or ‘omg I only have 36p in my account’) but all the adults in my life would never talk about how much they earn, how much money they have saved up etc. I wonder when you make that transition...
Tmi this comment, but I found that tilting to one side on the toilet it didnt hurt to pee but it didnt hirt to get a bath for me either after i give birth and got stitches xxx
the puzzle development in this was so accurate! everyone starts out loving puzzles but then by about an hour in they want to throw it across the room but at the same time you cant give up haha!\nI am going to need a puzzle update next week!!! xxx <3
does someone else hear music in the background during the haul? just checking that i'm not going crazy
Loved the vlog as always and loved all of your outfits this week Louise, were is the coat with the fur trim that you are wearing at the end from ? thanks xxx
oh lord, i bloody love you, Louise. You rock. Please be you always, ta. X
Your not awful for making a decision for you and your baby. Out of curiosity would like to know what you would prefer if you can choose this time?
I think it is vital for people to be open about how much they earn. As an upcoming uni grad I am looking at careers and, although it's not the only factor I consider, a huge factor of my decision making will be based on salary. If I don't know the money that is available from a career path then how do I know if that is something I will want to pursue to suit my lifestyle choices. I hope that makes sense and doesn't come off like I'm only thinking about making money!
I personally freely talk about how much I earn but that's just my personal preference. I am highly interested in how people that have jobs on social media and such do earn money like how it all works, but it's just everyone's personal preference on whether they disclose how much they earn. ❤
Aw man I went to ikea MK last Wednesday night, a day too late
There’s an amazing tapas in Northampton can’t remember the name but it’s in the market square x
You know what, I could really do with a homely Zoe and Louise vlog! Running errands and chilling in the house, love that kinda thing!
In regard to the bottle feeding, as the lovely Gi Fletcher would say, 'Happy mum, happy baby' you do whatever's best for you and baby, if you're distressed and upset with say breastfeeding, then it won't do baby any good. Your little girl will turn out great whether you breastfeed her or not because you're a fantastic mama! Good luck with the rest of the pregnancy and the delivery Louise, and your recovery, I hope all goes smoothly xxx
Hey guys, I've been making YouTube videos for a while now and I'm really trying to reach 200 subs, I would really appreciate it if you subbed ❤️
Louise breastfeeding is very personal and I hate that you had to justify yourself and brace yourself for the comments. No one is going to understand understand what you will be going through nor your choices. No explanation needed.
As you were talking about winners never quit as you hated the puzzle,  Can't Stop This Thing We've Started by Bryan Adams was playing in the background. He knew. Bryan always knows.
Hi only just got round to watching your weekly, me and my little baba are bk from the hospital where I've been reading your book (which o love btw) and I'm now chilling home and got my baby who's adorable, now I'm just so excited to see your lil one !!love watching what people are getting for their babies
You look so lovely Louise <3
Get braces 😬
No one needs to know how much you earn. You work hard for it that's all what matters.
Did I hear you refer to one of the kittens as a ‘she’ when Jim was holding it?I thought they were both boys? This happened to me when I bought my kitten. The breeder was certain she was a boy so I called her ‘Alfie’. Took her to her first vets appointment and the vets were like ‘no, she’s definitely a little girl’. Quick name change to ‘Missy’ and she’s now a lovely twelve year old cat. 😊
I love Esther!! I wanna be her friend too!!
Yes please with the fanny prep video!
In France there is that same silence around what you earn, but I still don't understand it! Our income is a part of our life, as it allows us to do/buy a certain amount and quality of products and activities. I we were less cringed about the idea of talking money, I think the world would be a better place. For example, in a group of friends, the ones with more money would pay more than the ones with less money in any activity! I think it would encourage people to be generous or/and ask for help ☺️

I actually do think it's ok to ask someone what they earn, maybe not the specifics but generally. This very British idea of it being vulgar is what leads to situations like that of the BBC where it was only when they were forced to reveal what their highest paid presenters earned that most of the women found out for the first time that they were earning way less then men for doing the same job.

this would be so much better to watch without the annoying asian dude.  he makes this good show not worth watching...
In Australia when someone says 'Red Rooster' the response is usually somewhere along the lines of that place sucks or do they still exist?
chinese fried chicken is still the best
I'm so conflicted on that last one...
you guys should've went to yardbird in las vegas ITS SO GOOD
What’s the song they play for the most expensive fried chicken?

that chicken at Sylvia's is so crunchy and crispy looking! For me it's worth it especially when you have cravings for chicken and is affordable.
These guys are the only reason I even go near Buzzfeed
Ayyyyeee I've been to Sylvia's Restaurant!!
U should let Keith tag along 😞
Australia here, Red Rooster is a chicken fast food chain here.. similar to KFC
OMG THE GUY FROM CHOPPED . I MUST GO
Am I the only one that thinks Adam is so precious
Stop stealing content from other content producers. You guys are the absolute worst.
PLS do a worth it slime episode !!!
How could they make this video and not have keith in it?! His love of fried chicken is legendary
In Australia we have a fast food chain called red rooster. It’s basically like a KFC or McDonald’s except smaller
I'm a chicken that costs way too much.. Jk 💸 😂🐓🔥💯
these guys are the only thing keeping Buzzfeed above water.
On my recommended regret watching because you made me hungry.😑
2:43 is when andrew is dethroned as the pun king
They should have brought Keith with them
I had the cheapo $50 version of this at Momofuku in TO and it felt good.
so the 500$ chicken was actually regluar chicken with 480$'s worth of caviar? lame.
I don’t even eat meat
At 14:04 to 14:10 water is just blowing up behind Andrew
Question. How much did that chicken really cost and how much did they pay for the caviar.
I feel like they feel obligated to overhype the overpriced food so they don't create an awkward situation lol
They should have bring Keith tbh\n👱🏻🍗
These episodes with Andrew and Adam are the best. The chemistry between all three is unbeatable.  I understand that you have to expand - but please find a way to keep these three together.  It is really very good.
You want $1,000 fried chicken?Fry the chicken in gold and top it off with some truffles and diamonds
That’s looks good
I hate that they dont show the exact price

Ste is so cute 😭♥️♥️♥️
If your original 21 games go missing, note you can always restore them by clicking Kernel in HakChi then choosing flash original kernel.\nThe way I kept all original games while also adding new games to the system is by including all original stock games in my sync in HakChi.\nYou can download a version of the tool with all stock games included in the following link if you would also like to do it this way:\nhttps://mega.nz/#!FUk0XapI!PQj1BEuQxgUo-FNTeGs5mPEqhKXn4wZpAvXh1LYG6Fg
Great Job very easy to follow.
already? damn lmao nice
how i hack my wife sosh e no levae me?
cant add more than 30 games for some reason?
Where can I find that sweet desktop wallpaper of Link and Zelda? Also what is the name of the song at the end?
Can you play Nes games on the Snes mini ?
Where did you get your wallpaper? Mind posting a link?
But can it run Crysis?
Everything works fine except the 2 player controller does not work on the new games that are 2 player.\nnba jam, ken griffey jr baseball, killer instinct
Thinking about giving this a crack on a mac (hahaha), is there anything different you think in need to be aware of? Love video btw... very well explained and seems easy to follow!
Too much of a pain. Want be buying SNES mini yet. I do have an original SNES with wildcard and a ufo 9 sd copy. To be fair the pi emulator is not bad plus as more to offer
Is there a way to add Super Mario bros classic game on SNES MINI CLASSIC?! Thank you.
chrono trigger crashes at the town square
Ok i know where they freezes came from, if i press the down analog on the Joystick i starts to stop working (Controller doesnt work anymore and its not possible to press something) but the console just keeps runnning.... idea?
hey the games are not showing up in the hakchi games folder somebody please help
not getting past dump. driver wont install
yis
Gonna buy mine later :)
Fantastic tutorial.
I'm going to test this using smc files tonight, wish me luck!
11:11 - doesn't even use find and replace :p
I'm sure that a hakchi update will fix the issue but the box art for the game you added looks so much smaller than the rest.  Hope they fix it.
Nice screen saver dude
Awesome! Easy to follow tutorial but many steps. But with the new SNES Classic can hold only around over 200 games in sfc format, not that much I can do anyway. I will back up all those original 21 games right away so in case if I mess up like those guys below, I can always put them back. Hopefully, there's a simpler way to do this and it can take zip files instead of sfc files.
You dont need to change the desktop file or else. Just add the sfrom in hakachi.
Can you download the snes classic software on to a NES classic? I'm thinking that you can replace the NES kernel with the snes classic kernel
Awesome! Unlike other (also good) videos on this subject, you actually managed to keep the original games also!\nIf I'm going to wait for the official Hakchi2 update, I definitely go check out your vid again.\nJust out of curiosity, have you tried adding NES games?
Makes me really happy to see, that it definately works. Now it´s just a matter of time until the hakchi software is updated to do all the little steps that you showed here automatically. Thanks for this detailled description. Even if hakchi would never be updated i am pretty sure to get those steps done all by myself.
I have another question ^^ where can i find roms for SNES mini ? Can i have a link please ? thx and gj for your video
👀
I alredy have 5 new games but i lost my pre installed 21..Do you know where can i find these twenty one?\nThanks a lot.
Official Hakchi drops in a few days people.
@Skullator. Hey, how to? I think you should listen to my songs :). youtube․com/XimerTracks
Is there currently a method to do this on Mac, or would it be the same?
I will get my SNES Mini today and then I will try this out. Seems not that hard. I'll share my experience later :)\n\nReally nice Tutorial btw! Your voice is extremely good to listen to^^
Any Linux tools instead of WinDoze?
I love my sneeze mini
Nvm i cant download the sfc2s file
This is pretty cool. Plus I'm glad to be 4th
It works
Guys, just wait a week or two for a way more easier way to put new games on the SNESC. Currently it is waaay to cryptic.
where the fuck did you get that image at? its beautiful.
I'm giving away an SNES classic, check it out!!
that link for python doesnt inclue a download option
Can't wait to try this one. Got my Snes Mini just a few das ago. Thanks a lot for the effort man!
YouTube removed you from my notifications. Not that it matters because it takes an hour for them to notify me of uploads nowadays.
I can't seem to find a homebrew game to use for the game file, also all my original games have gone. how do i get them back?
I cant play 2 player games for any roms i download. Only the original 21 games work as 2 player. Please help?
you need more subs
aww I had hoped you got Star Ocean to work and show us at the end...
Can you tell me how nonpdrm works ?
Does this keep the original 21 games on it, even if we add a new game? It looked like it did as the 21 default games were selected, but I want to be sure :D
Just got Zombie Ate My neighbors working! Thanks a ton my dood!
Does SD2VITA work on 3.65?
Please stop calling it Snes it is S-N-E-S ;D terrible to hear that ^^
your video left me stuck on where i opened up the hackchi.exe. Am i suppose to plug in my snes mini before i open it up because it doesn't show any games what so ever.
thank you Mr.Aussie!
Does anyone know how many megabyte we have to store new games? I hope there will be lots of space to add games to the original 21!\n\n(I'm asking for the SNES Classic European version of there's a difference)\n\nThank you!
so I dumped the kernel and flashed it as custom kernel again, but I only see one single game called bioworm...\ndid I mess something up? SNES Classic still runs normally as it usually should do though
I tried it on Japanese Super Famicom Mini. Sadly does not work. Tried to add Chrono Trigger but ended up with a faulty game and no other games on the roster. I can easily flash the original kernel to recover it though, but sad I can't add games. Any ideas?
I cannot proceed this further than the Sync Games. I could dump the kernel, flash the custom kernel - that was all fine. The driver installed correctly for that. But when I boot the mini NOT in diagnostic mode but just switching it on normally for game sync I can't get passed the Turn your NES Mini on.. dialogue. Hitting Install Driver from there pops up a command line NES mini not found, sorry. Any ideas?
Will there be Game Genie support
We didn't compress the .sfrom file?
Lost all the original games, please help
Do all roms work?
How do I dump the original 21 Games? Is there any possible way?
Followed these instructions to the letter and everything works great! Well, except for folders/pages on mine, changed to just show all games on the home screen and no more C8 errors. :D\nI can't seem to get Illusion Of Time/Gaia working though, from multiple sources/roms. Has anyone had any luck with this one?
I can't set my console type to SNES Mini on this. It's only NES. Help?
my computer doesnt recognize the snes cause their is no driver available for it?
I might be doing something wrong but i'm finding the second controller isn't working with the games i put on. (Stunt Race FX and Street Fighter 2 The New Challengers.)
Thanks! Going to try it first thing tomorrow. 😀
How many roms can be added?
Can you save and rewind?
Can the current version of hakchi2 brick my snes mini?
I fucking love your wall paper!!! where can I find it?
The Hakchi2 tool linked to is still the 2.17 d in stead of the suposed 2.18 shown in the video. I get you did some work on getting this working. Its not version 2.18 in the download. Keep up the work with hacking the Snes mini though.
It works!\n\nI tried a few games and all of them work except the background music of a lot of games is acting up, like a cd that skips. Playing most games work flawlessly, except for 1 or 2 games that seem to lag when you run too fast.\nAlso, when I dump or flash a kernel, the light of the SNES turns on while step 4 in the process says that should not be the case. It does complete whatever it's doing so I guess it's alright. Between dumping the original kernel and flashing the custom kernel I reconnected the SNES. The light turned on again while flashing, but it completed without issue. I also checked if I could go back to my own original kernel and that works fine also.\n\nIt's a bit of work to put in for each game, but once they're on there, they're on there and I don't need an extra 100 games, just my personal classics. Ahhh Prehistorik Man :D\n\nThank you for the tutorial! :)
I can't get the original 21 to show up.  When I add new games they sync, but then the originals are lost.  I can flash the kernel back to restore them, but then I lose the additional games.
I have several roms that are .smc or even .fig because they're translated... won't they work?
Nice to see your work getting mentioned in these hack articles mate getting your work noticed.
Epic im gonna go try this!
I might wait until the easier method comes along :)
U CAN JUST ADD SNES GAMES TO THE NES MINI WITH RETROARCH MOD AND BUY A SNES MINI CONTROLLER FOR YOUR NES MINI WHATS THE DIFFERENCE I UNDERSTAND HOW THE MODEL FOR THE SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT BUT STILL WHY NOT??? :/
How do I fill my Hakchi Games folder with the 21 games that came on the system? I've managed to get Super Star Wars working, but it's now the only game on the system.
Hakchi wont let me select the snes mini
I am just a beginner with this but how do I reflash the  snes mini? I can't see anything in the menu of the hackchi program. And i only see my gam eof chrono trigger in the menu. Can you please help me? I want all the 21 games back...
Quit calling the SNES as a word, It's not
I added 4 custom games. 1 image works but 3 of them don't appear on the SNES. It is in png. Does it have to be a specific KB size?
Games load fine but I've lost all sound both in the loaded games and the originals anyone know how to fix this?
My Australian version SNES Mini is being held by US Customs. 😥
Cool but I'll hold off for a bit should be soon for this to become atomic like hakchi  is get covers etc... good work to the people that got this working 😎😎
if i use your link for the snes roms, what abuot save states and other saves? since i cant seem to find how to get my own games dumped with the auto folder? pretty confused since the games were never dumped? never owned a nes mini so new to this.
Does this work with Super Famicom Mini? Anyway to do this for the JP version?
Havnt done any coment for months and the first thing u do is this weak overpriced emulator garbage? Weak!
So a ROM is about 6.1MB. I have a short SNES game collection, a bit over 75 games and there wouldn't be enough space for all of them, that blows.
If i make this , can i lose my savedata of my games? Thanks
hi i fast 3rd
dont worke isntalled the programm run cmd it says WRONG NAME OR NOT ON YOUR COMPUTER i installed it on C: dont worke BULLSHTI!
Wow!  I wanted a Snes Mini just for Star Fox 2 but I never tought it was worth it since it's very expensive here in Brazil.  But after watching your video I really want one!  That's amazing!  Thank you!
Small correction: The Saturn V rocket is obviously Saturn 5 as it's a roman numeral. Sorry about that.\nEnjoy the video!
Even if it were true. It would take decades for humans to build any real infrastructure there
7:54 welcome to internet whos thinking its actually a pic taken from the surface of Mars 😂
Well I was going to thumbs up this video UNTIL I HEARD THE MUSIC AT THE BEGINNING OF IT
His idea of using BFR to go to the Moon and Mars is on point. But his idea of using it to cheaply transport people around the globe in less than an hour is quite absurd.
Reusable rockets is a stupid idea. Flying anywhere on earth in a rocket is a stupid idea. For someone that claims to want to help the environment he is now going to consume the earth in rocket fumes yeah brilliant idea Elon. Seems like every time he opens his mouth fan boys go running to jerk him off. What happened to the bullshit Hyper Loop. Here is the thing none of the ideas are his. These ideas have been around longer then him.
this is the future!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
David Bowie would be proud
Watched the video, read the comment section. Most humans are stupid.
Will the BFR have a pilot?
Can someone please tell me what the whole point of going to Mars, aside from the technological leap to pull it? There's nothing as seen on the images, you might as well go to Sahara, Himalayas or or Antarctica.
Wtf is wrong with your sense of music??? Really wanting to mute it right now
we should fix this planet before we go out to others.
I think they need a spinning circular disk to recreate earths gravity to help the heart pump blood and not allow blood to pool in the head. We should slowly release that over time and force inhabitants to adapt. We also need to bring bacteria from earth and help it survive in the soil of mars as we grow food there. It’s called the microbiome. There is a connection with gut bacteria and brain function as well as health. On top of that we need to deal with the high energy electromagnetic waves making everyone go blind as it passes through the optic nerve and permanently damages the nerves ability to transmit signals. There is the problem of DNA damage as well. If we can somehow get the metal inside the planet hot and spinning we may be able to create a magnetic barrier from the sun. We take earth for granted so much.
The BFR is a Big Fucking Rocket
All very exciting but shouldn't we be pouring all this energy into a self sustainable future on earth first. Just seems like we are running away from our problems
GET YOUR ASS TO MARS!
People who thought air travel was not possible were fools. Clearly birds could fly and glide. But colonizing Mars is far far more challenging.
Let's do this!
BFR - Big Failure Rocket. Or Big Faulty Rocket.Possible. In fact that will be future. But obviously not like Musk propose on this presentation. The craft will not be actualy a rocket. But all in one solution. Pretty much like milenium falcon. DTOL - Diagonal take off and Landing. Combine that with the ekranoplan technology from the cold war period and you have it. Electrical air craft using wing in ground effect. it will take off diagonally at 45 degree angle and definetely will not go to orbit. Will fly low to the surface. Smooth acceleration and deceleration.\nIf you want to go in outer cosmos - boost the speed up and climb higher. Several propulsion systems combined. UART,electrical turbines,centrifugal systems,ION engines. It will have also tungsten carbide hull with carbon fiber mesh.\nIt will have reverse thrust,electromagnetic shield to repell the radiation. In fact the solar wind,the gamma and xrays as well as any possible particles, even subatomic particles can be used as propellant. Basicly the ship will act as giant vacuum cleaner,compressor and accelerator. It will look much more like star destroyer than a rocket. Of course we cant raise the money instantly to develop such craft at once. But that technologies are simply upgrades to the ekronaplan technology. And i have a power source methods which i call paradox power. PV cells are built in, not ouside the ship. No outside parts at all.\nMy model i named ураган which on english means hurricane. Hyper turbines,ultra turbines. Not just turbines.\nTriangular shape. Very similar to star destroyer but without the top bridge. More like super star destroyer. Of course not that big. At leas first versions will not be that much big. First model will be 70 meters long,40 meters wide and 14 meters high at the highest point. Bonus - it will act as seaship and submarine as well. Then a ticket of 10 dolars can be achieved. And the ship will be extremely reusable.
Im so excited for all this!!\nJust curious, wont commercial use fuck the environment?
Sorry there will be wars at mars
And I need at least until 2026-2028  to finish my master of engineering 😭
Well elon musk is really dreaming big... Hoping it would have a happy ending...
Cgi is go to mars
Who wants to live on a shitty red planet with rocks ??
Elon Musk doesn't address the problems with zero gravity in transit, and reduced gravity for a prolonged period while on Mars, at all. Humans evolved on earth, we have very specific environmental demands, we are going to have to deal with those challenges if we want to settle permanently anywhere else.\n\nI would love to see a manned mission to Mars, but any kind of colonization, I think, is further into the future than we might like to admit.
I was waiting for him to tell us what BFR stands for. I really hope it's Big F*cking Rocket
After musk’s announcement my girlfriend asked me: so musk will be using rockets to compete with commercial airliners to make money to build rocket to go to mars ??? I replied Yes. She then asked me how about all those rocket emissions resulting from all those earth to earth trip ?? Isn’t musk all about sustainability and environment... I didn’t know what to say !!
Whoopee do, Kim Jong Un and the DPRK have already commenced construction of the moon base and their Mars colonisation will commence 2019.
I think it would be better that we first save the beautiful planet we have. Great video by the way.
i bet all of us will die of old age and there will be no mars colony.elon  is just a rich scam artist
This is still the best channel ever! Keep up the good work.
Elon was like we fucked earth now let’s fuck mars
I think it would not be posibel in the next 150 years. Posibel rovers to build infrastructure in the next 20 years would be ambiguous.
What accent is that
Any plans to make video about Proterra electric buses? I heard lot about them now a days.
Why was I not subbed yet!? I'm seriously pretty excited that I will be seeing us go to Mars in my life time, I'm only sixteen and not even nearly smart enough to now what all of this means but it's so interesting
Weird question : What kind of mic do you use ? Your audio is great
They’re going to do it
we have come so far in only 100 years why schould this be impossible?
Everything that is economically unsustainable will ultimately fail. This will not become a reality. That's not to say it isn't possible...\n\nThat's why I get excited about the idea of truly commercial space projects such as asteroid mining.
Can't believe how totally committed so many assholes are to attacking what is the most ambitious project ever undertaken\nIf they end up saying I told you so then we all lose
Instead , Just Launch A Bigger Satellite , SO I CAN GET A BETTER FUCKING INTERNET CONNECTION
2024 or 2040 doesn't matter. The matter is if we will go to mars or not.
Elon Musk is a salesman. His job is to sell Space X as a brand. In no way shape or form are we Humans landing a person on Mars.\n\nStop falling for this guy. The truth is he has no way of getting people there or Space X hasn't figured out all the challenges of surviving deep space. The martian atmosphere or even how you would get a person back.\n\nThis is just all idiotic.
Awosome!!! Not sure about 2024 but definately he will do it, im just excited that they will do it in our lifes span
There's people dying from starvation and these MF are spending millions of dollars in finding new planet.
i unsubed cuz you dont fact check or try to debunk anything
DO WE GET FREE INTERNET ON MARS
No one cleared this with me.. We'll see about all this.. How do you know I don't have something waiting for that ass once you chimps get there.. 👺
people looking for intro music song \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGB4lB9VVBI
Have you concerned a sonic Boom of the BFR delivering passengers around the world or that an apollo launch was just over 3g and the BFR will land at 10g I don't think most executives want they arse hole to fall out on landing and blackout it's crazy hype all around this guy it's will be a robocop type device next just sit back and look at the engineering before you jump onboard a hyperloop wreck you nearly hit it with the currency video then you retracted it not to be a target and just fell back in the trap of capatlism and it's lies.
Work more at it and faster. How about going too the Moon?
I always crack up when someone says 'BFR' esp in a serious tone.\n\nPS-I love Musk...what a great man.
I went there already, nothing there, only red sand
Imagine your loved once being in mars far away from you in future. 😅
When Elon Musk says something, i believe it.
NASA should just be able to buy BFRs on a government contract from SpaceX with the license to be able to modify the rocket however they see fit. No need to waste time and money on two designs to get to Mars.
I'm curious to see what would happen to the human body when subjected to 1/3 of Earth's gravity for an extended period of time. I'm especially curious to see how children's bodies will develop if born on mars. \n\nExercise is good hygiene here on Earth. I imagine it may be necessary for survival on Mars. \n\nBut who knows, I could be entirely wrong. They may just develop to be a sustainably frail subspecies of humans. But humans adapted to Mars coming to Earth may be impossible for physiological reasons.
You sir who created this channel along with the people who works hard in making your videos, are AMAZING! I'm glad you existed.
I think Mars could be an excellent opportunity to research teraforming. In the process of trying to teraform mars, perhaps we could find a way to fix our planet?
Matt damon's movie ELYSIUM in the making....
THIS is how it NEEDS TO BE DONE :   Put robots on Mars first, so that the structures can be put into place before anyone arrives.  Sending people before any life-sustaining structures are build is just asking for trouble and death.
This is a good age to be alive. First human on other planet is something comparable to the invention of writing and of course more spectacular than that.If Musk manage to do that he will be remembered till the end of humanity.
It's possible, but musk creeps me out.
Hey Dagogo please cover the nobel prize winners :)
Does this mean there will be a call of duty marsian warfare?
If Earth  will turn in Fallout, people would happily to go to Mars to pursue better life. Oops, don't tell this to Elon Musk!!
Big Fucking Rocket BFR thats what it stands for
Elon's Musk.\n\nThe new fragrance.
We are already there.
i will lead the flat mars campaign .
They've got booster landings down pat now, but I think it will take them multiple failures to master landing the upper stage (which will be a very different massing when returning empty, with cargo, and with passengers). With such a large and expensive vehicle, I wonder whether they'll be able to get it down before they run out of money.
I want to go to mars just to get away from these leftards ruining society for everyone.
A $2 million cessna light aircraft **shows cessna 152 worth under $100K**\n\nI hope thats not what Musk meant
BFR = Big Fucking Rocket. \n\nEver since doom all i see is big fucking in front of everything
Elon, please build fusion reactor and Gundams
Tmobile Sprint merge, what you think?
luv u elon
Cool video as usual
BFR stands for big fucking rocket its genius!
Earth is flat
Nice!
BFR = Big Frucking Rocket
Musk ye dum dewg send me to marz brah
Dont trust a damn thing Elon Mush says.
way to ambitious
love ur channel
With Elon Musk anything is possible!
Why tho?
BFR = Big Fucking Rocket
It's so crazy how changing your name from coldfustion to coldfusion enabled you so many more subscribers. I remember when you had way under 100k subs and were thinking about stopping this youtube thing.\n\nSo happy you continued making videos!! (A little bit of SEO can go a long way ;) )
Who actually believes this shit would work? Rockets are really explosive, launchpads are expensive, and landing is relatively difficult. \n\nAt any possible price, people would be paying 3X as much to save like freaking 7 hours of travel time. Best case:\n\nProject actually works in 40 years. Price relegates it to the rich.\n\nWOOOOOO. FAKE HYPE OVER IMPOSSIBLE IDEASSSS. I DON'T FACT CHECK!
The earth is flat! It's all a lie
I might be able to visit Mars within my lifetime. I can't even wrap my head around how amazing this is.
Even if we could, why should we?  There are no resources there.  We would only be using material that we need here on Earth and getting nothing back.  Everyone in the world is scrambling for resources and this video suggests we simply shoot them into Outerspace because we are able to.  Sci-Fi boner!  Hooray!  But it makes no sense.
It could be true if they had enough funding. If nasa or space x had like a 100 billion budget every year we could speed up the process by so much that we'd even start colonizing Mars by 2050 or earlier and maybe start traveling to other solar systems.
Going to shit.
So many Musketeer fuckboy's about, my god the education system is fucked nobody can tell real life from the fantasy that spews out of Musk's stupid mouth.

Who is homeboy?!
Wow, imagine having no dialect of your own and just being a sad parody of cultures you've only observed from afar. Also imagine having such terrible taste in shoes =\
Homeboys gonna like...get it
so many u know what
2:21 I had a heart attack
This is the worst video on the internet
She's actually such an awkward person
Crease the hell out of those shoes. Hurt my heart
lmao I promise you she says the N word off camera. Almost certain.
Homeboy, dope, got to be fresh, ya know what?
She was low key wanting joe to come by the house to “look at her sneakers” big time
If homeboys coming through with this it's quiet. But if homeboys going to come through in like THESE homeboy is gonna like geeet it
so the weeknd fuck that huh
homeboy bella as much as i love you please stop now sksks💀
I pull up with some random ass shoes and i still get it
Why she talking like that ? , this makes her so stupid!! sorry not sorry 😷
Ok but that fit is a look i gotta recreate it
the way she talks is unattractive
It's not let's get it it's ESKEETIT
her surgery is so obvious in motion smh
2:20 the most painful freeze frame of all time.
Take a shot every time she says dope 🤣
https://goo.gl/iJMR4P\n\nI'm Professional T Shirt Designer .I can create an Eye Catching T Shirt Design- for your Brand/Company\nThank you
I feel sad after this vid 2:21
I want to put my babies in her
2:21 she better have had some force fields in
Whomst else lost 15 years off of their lifespan watching her forced attempt at sounding cool and urban
Idc how cringey she is she'd still catch it 🤤
that intro is fire
LOOOL 😂😂😂😭 why ? She looks uncomfortable like it's a interview they should have just used Kendall or Kylie.. even kim or Caitlin
Her pants are atrocious and do not work with 1’s
Again! Why the fuck does complex think i want to watch bella hadid shop for sneakers when I know she just started wearing them. Stop giving us trendy white women to look up to, she's not cool, shes a corn ball like the rest of them and this was extremely mediocre for complex to even get her to do some shit like this,  none of them at the company have any individual/new innovative ideas.
Her hair extensions are getting on my nerves lol
her choice of words match her style
shes pretty but she's sounds like a  whole cornball  aghajsjsk
is this supposed to be a joke?
Im cool with dirty sneakers but they BETTER be fresh bish what??
la puma i hope you got to sniff the clam
those flight suit 5's are trash though.
talking about saving up for some shoes, girl bye your dads a billionaire talking about saving up headass 😂
Birds should not be allowed to speak just cause they're cute!!! You young girls need to learn how much of a turn off it is for ya'll to be posing and having a foul mouth! It isn't cute!!!
I saw the promo for this and was like wha!? dope I didn't know bella was a sneakerhead! this segment should be cool I watched this and was like NOPE! just another socialite rich girl with money to buy sneakers and real hood friends to put her on. I like her too and was looking forward to hearing what she had to say but I think she just managed to have the sneakerhead community scratching their head and cringing at the awkward answers.
Drink everytime she said you know what
Trying to hard to sound “down”. Sit your ass down, girl.
She's hot AF😍
Christ on a bike you're not black
*CRINGE* Not trying to be a hater! But she is boring AF! And her slang seems so fake here and she’s trying so hard!
Perfect example of how your stupid attitude can totally destroy your beauty as a person
you got some air MAXes out here, and you got some JoRDAANS,  homeboys gonna like \n\n\n\n....get it
white ppl like herself needs to understand, dat u don need to impress anyone to be hip or cool' if u try too much, you'll looQ weird n awkward, and jus plain flat out uncomfortable, jus b ya self then peeps would eventually like n fuck wit u, its not hard
Trying too hard. Hair, outfit and slang. Very unnatural. There's no way she talks like that in real life.
Complex what the fuck is this? Bring in Teyana Taylor or someone who actually is a sneaker head.
I’m in fucking love with her but the way she talks sounds fake af
anyone cringe when it showed her kneeling in the 1s😫
ive never given a video a thumbs down but she really deserved it
Met her, Talked to her, and she came off as she's trying way too hard... but hey, could just be me.
Presented by white famous... How apt.
Why is everything she says uncomfortable
1:32 to 1:55 made me want to crawl inside myself and die
homeboy it's gonna like getitttt, Bitch! Sit you ass down and shut the fuck up 😂😂😂
Why does she dress like she's stuck in the early 2000's???
Joe straight up smashing
Dont be saying homeboy and dope lmaooooo
wtf thats cheap af for that haul?
Get faze
LMAO STOP
RiP 2:21
SNEAKER SHOPPING WITH BIG SHAQ. MAKE IT HAPPEN.
cringy
I like adidas more :)

Cardi B
2:21 creased
i love woah vicky
Who is bella hadid

Homeboys gonna like.....get it 😖
socially awkward much...
HoMeBoY's GoNnA lIkE.........gEt It
Lil pump
2:20 NOOOOOO
Use a spoon please
Get Daddy Yankee next
her hair looks crunchy
I swear dudes love overhyping mediocre looking white girls
this is top tier cringe worthy
homegirl has more sneakers than braincells
Please get Travis Scott!
cringe
Do lil pump
I'd smash, homeboy
I am laughing so bad Omg
holy shit she's annoying

She said “it’s quiet” ewww LMFAOOO

Gucci has always been a role model for me and it's crazy to see how far he's come. I'm so proud of him. He inspired me and showed me the way. He was one of the main reasons I started rapping, Thank you GM P.s..If you guys got a minute, check out the music on my channel.I promise you won't be disappointed.
Hot song! Wal-Mart women in the video

Shit rapper with his shit music. Without his music, he wouldn't be able to afford Gucci. What an offence to Gucci to call himself Gucci Mane. As for Met Gala, this is hardly it. I bet he doesn't get invited to any fashion events.
This song makes the IT's Clown get frightened by children

The face of dean ambrose 0:32
I was there and everybody was silent except for my little baby brother watching some cringy toy channel video#PrayforLasVegas
Thank you WWE it means a lot we need everyone to pray for us and help us out much love #PrayForVegas
I always like moments like these, mainly because I like to compare superstar heights, and damn it looks like Gallows is taller than Strowman here.
Why is shane on raw?
Roman front an center next to vince, showing what a suck up he is
World class this is, fair play
*SHANE, YOU'RE EXPOSING THE BUSINESS!*
Do it for all the terror attacks . Hate has no state or country
I no the Manchester London attacks weren't in America it would have been nice for a tribute for those as wwe fans r worldwide.
Vince in the middle with his 2 boys.What a happy family.
It was very terrible what happened in Las Vegas. This was the 1st time the WWE held a moment of silence without the bell ringing 10 times because of a tragedy since the tragedy in Orlando over a year ago. God help both those cities.
That was so silent i thought my earbuds stoped working
STOP THE HATE pray for Vegas
Wow I haven't seen Vince or Tj in a long time.
It rally suvks when something like this has to happen in my hometown.
i don't get why anybody would dislike this
Respect to all the Families who lost a loved one in Las Vegas
I was watching the opening of the Redskins vs Chiefs game; saw some jerk sitting on the bench during the Anthem and fan(atics) making noise during the Moment of Silence.\n\nSwitched it over to Raw (I had waiting for me on DVR Double Play) and you could hear a pin drop during the Moment of Silence.\n\nClass!
Why are there so many attacks in different places I mean this HAS to STOP
lolz, theres no way that the wrestlers actually care about what happened xD
My prayers and thoughts to people lost life and got hurt in Los Vegas and Puerto Rico and Miami Florida and Texas and Mexico anywhere at.And plus we lost a lot of music singers and celebrity this year too.Tom Petty,The guy from Steely Dan passed away Walter Becker.And guy own a lot of game shows and TV shows has passed away to Monty Hall today the Co-Creator Let's make's a Deal.This is just sad day...😢😢😢
Hey what happens in vegas stays in vegas😂😂
I live in Las Vegas
Of course Bayley is standing next to Finn Balor
Hmmph\n\nWell, it looks like the one armed bandits struck again......\n\nI'll just pay my respects and see myself out.
Pray for the World!!! Lets have a moment of silence for the world daily
Kurt angel makes a traingel sign off illuminati wake upp
Never heard the arena so quiet
Its so sad and to know i was right across from everything at the luxor was even scariest
I'm starting to think that dislikes on youtube are automatic... like who can dislike something like this???
are you a short WWE Superstar??  ok, we need you in the back
Where's sin Cara!!! Is he still in WWE?
What's was the tragedy that happened in Las Vegas (L.V)
May God give peace to their souls who are died in that Las Vegas attack 😔😔
Today's wrestling crowd might not be as active or loud as the crowd was 10-20 years ago, but at least their more respectful at actually being silent in moments of silence for tragic occurrences like the one in Vegas.
What happen in vegas stay in vegas.
Thank You WWE. For this heartfelt remembrance of the victims and families of Las Vegas..
what was Shane doing on raw
its funny how they try to make it all look real and make it seem like guys actually dislike eachother in wwe then everyone suddenly a family for things like this.I am not saying them coming together to support vegas is wrongs i am just saying its quite funny cuz next monday you gonna see reigns spearing cena and sstrowman
I'm surprised Alexa broke character for once
No way it got that silent I bet someone yelled something
Is it really that many superstars on raw
We stand with los Angeles...
You know my thoughts and prayers  are with the victims
We all just need to take moment and look at Dean ambrose
Really well done soooo quite really respectful well done Wwe and it’s fans
272 people will have their souls taken by the Undertaker.
why not pray for Syria ? \nthey are not humans ??
They stand with Vegas but not with Mexico
Why was Shane there
Dean looks like he's about to bust a nut.
Thanks for the moment of silence it means a lot
Couldn't even make it a full minute...
I stand with Las Vegas, much love from Glasgow, Scotland
It is so confusing to see a arena with people that are completely silent ...🙊
Peoples were saying jinder mahal was also there ....where is he...???
This made me cried
Pray for verges
Pray4Vegas
Pause at 0:23 OMG New authority Confirmed

Lol Look At Braun
Why do they keep putting real world events in a scripted tv show?
20 people got shot the man who shot the people killed himself to 💧💧💧💧💧💧💧💔💔💔💔💔
Notice hhh hbk charolette missing? because they are haters and liars.
BORING!! No Body cares!
And what about México and Puerto Rico?
What was the motive behind those attacks? Just someone suddenly goes mad and starts killing people and himself also??
This is the proof that wwe is scripted. Why? Because they are totally enemy but they are joining together.
Why is Macklemore testing these carbon wheels and using a Scottish accent? ?
I don't care about the rins, my concern is how he did that up fuck stairs 180. Godamn Danny
Now let Loose and Rat test the wheels.
Danny's ankles and knees are going to so fucked..that dude is going to be one painful old dude
I thought the man was gonna 180 down a set then i see him 180 up a set even easier than down it
how dafaq did he 180 up a 8 set
Am i the only one the thought he was testing the wheel
Danny is a Legend!!! 👍 👌 👏
This guy is insane
That video made me so happy!!!!!!😁
i heared a chris king hub i might be wrong tho
1:08 How the fuck didn't you get a puncher or a pinched innertube???????
Aonde eu encontro esse aro? Em q site?
I want these so bad every thing you make is extremely well worth the money your v10 your nomad is my dream garage
Testing carbon rims that looks like a fun crack 😀😆
Sometimes I don't understand why people dislike stuff. This video is awesome!
Love music track :) antonio sanchez  with soundtrack to birdman open new door for music in this plastic world :)
the whole time until he took the tire off i thought he was talking about the tires not the rims
TORTURE testing at its best..!!!!
All we need now is carbon inner tubes
Oh god\nJust give me put on mine xc bike😆
That’s what you get wen you pay $10,000 per wheel. You get alien technology.
Hey their! If you have santa cruz frame if i were you i better use Shimano Deore XTR group set and FOX fork.
give bigboy a set of these please  ! #standwithscotty
That pose. I did it.
I wonder how these would hold up for Bmx street riding like if they would hold up Santa Cruz needs to make them in 20”
Spider bike spider bike does what a spider might lol
I've never actually seen him fall before
This rim broke in four minutes!!!!  Never buying these.......
It took such a beating
And now here I am with my Fulcrum XC wheels, bending them and bending them back they are totally fucked. Really fragile considering some Mavic rims but on a budget for a Hardtail also a wider rim above 30mm better.
Bike of Chuck Norris ? 😂😂😂😂😂
Every roadie had an anuerism at 2:50
How much are these BMF'ers?
Children in Afrika could have eatin the wheel
How much is it
The weight on these aren't horrible either.. I was expecting heavier after having seen this
Thats just cruel...
crazy
Not that impressed.  I did a 2 foot long jobby once.  Now that was impressive!
I bought abike for 2.000 ebike there serously worth to buy it saves u from buying shitty petrol very powerful bikes
Would somebody please think of those poor stairs and the damage that is being done to them. \n\nYeah yeah nice rims and all, but those stairs are beauts. All flat and, perfecto spaced sexy as dick right now. Lol
I always find it funny when a watch a YouTube video and see glasgow
But did they replace that rim under warranty?   :)
Danny boy gets his back rim burst to bits 😆😆😆
Could you next time please tell us what tire pressure you use for riding,jumping,.....
That is one MEGA SICK set of wheels
Racer wheels wouldn't stand a chance ......, because they are crap lol
I need this rim, mine is bent so bad that a certain rotation point it hit against the bike frame on both sides and it makes funny noisy. Long story short my rim is fucked
He was next to my house
I thought the title said Reverse Carbon Wheels\n\nWas hoping for rubber rims and carbon tires lmao
please make a 20 in bmx wheelset
Carbon is strong, no doubt!
that's some crazy quality compared to aluminum or steel
I stick to my old school alloy 26
seeing him do that when it went flat hurt me in way you can't imagine 😂
Don't you want some flex in the rims so hits dont feel as hard
Du bist so dumm
fuck ebike#wat a fraud formal Ban

How much cost your bike? (Answear plz)
Btilliant! Fun to watch

Nice
OMG
强的一批
Damn... great marketing move. Def some good rims.
Gotta love Chemistry
Hablan solo ingles U.U
Noice, smash em!
Fudendo um aro assim, pqp
Only Danny... smh
Crazy Rim! Great Video ;)
Top bloke.
Lol
YOU WANT TI NRAKE THE BICICLE 😤😤
sicher haben die nach jedem versuch die felge gewechselt
I'm seeing some weird artifacts around the guy at 1:40, especially in the head and arms area. Any idea why?
I'm not saying they are bad, I'm just saying he was putting his weight on the front tire during the hard stuff

The guy's got too much money to smash a good bike to make fools, so it's one of them. It would have been better to show the stunts and how strong he was, and he gave it to the boy 12-14 years, be riding on a bike that the parents can't buy a good bike from. Stupid video, Dizlajk.
PLEASE do no do this test again in a public space...you know that when carbon fiber breaks it leaves very sharp splinters everywhere so don't you think some animals like a dog could get injured walking in that area? Love you guys but just wanted to point that out.
am guessing a couple of grand per set the add uk tax e.t.c oh £3000 a pair. i'll have a set for everyday of the year cheers ;-p
I wonder how many wheels/rims were used to make this advertisement.
What kind of bike class is that ?
What is this bike name?
Jim stop playing pranks on Dwight.
Gotta get Cici to college any way he can
Bears, beets, Battlestar Galactica.
Looks like Dwight finally took things too far
Dame Michael Scot. Threat Level Midnight 2 looks amazing.
Reminds me of Call of Duty cutscenes.
Where’s Pam?
He's probably just trying to save the receptionist
Goldenface is that you?
Can't take this seriously watched to much office lol
I guess his sport agent thing didn't work out.
Goldenface???!!!
Glad John Krasinski is back to doing more action/military movies. He was awesome and a BADASS in 13 Hours! Looking forward to this
i see Jim. i click
Goldenface is at it again
Jimbo
Sorry John, you will never not be Jim.
why is it so bad?
This looks like it's loosely based on Teeth of the Tiger? So they're just skipping over Ryan's whole Presidency and just inserting Junior into the film world?
Is this another one of those fake CIA pranks you and Pam pull on Dwight? You might have taken it to far, like Sam Pepper far
This is gonna be his best prank yet. Dwight won't know what's coming
You've got the wrong guy man!  I'm just some dude looking at YouTube videos!  HEEEEEEEELP!!!
Jim's pranks are getting out of control.
JIM STOP THIS NONSENSE AND GET BACK TO WORK
Fck. Can't wait too see John Krasinski in a more serious role. Love this man. \n\n\n\n\n#nohomo
Lmao they used the sound bite of muslim yelling that's used in CoD.
Hi Jim
I want a rainbow six movie. (Like the actual Clancy book)
For the life of me, I can't understand why people who can't separate Krasinski from Jim Halpert want to point out that level of stupidity endlessly. This series looks amazing.
John Krasinski really pulls off the military/ intelligence look pretty well. Who would have thought a salesman at a mid-level, failing paper supply company would be so good at this line of work?
that voice. is his voice channeling... Harrison's Ryan? either way, i'm in!
Tom Clancy you're crazy dude, how you make all these games and movies by yourself?
They shouldn’t have put John in the thumbnail
The Esurance guy is really movin' up in the world.
I came for the office jokes
I just see JIM
Threat level Midnight part 2: Return of Goldenface
Jim, enough with the pranks
I'm on board.
This looks exactly the same as his movie 13 Hours
i swear the arabic shouting at 0:09 is from Call of Duty 4
Why does it still feel like Jim's playing some prank on Dwight? lol
I’m sorry I just can’t take him seriously.
I think it would make everyone’s day if there was more people from the office in this
This Must be a joke! “A man’s gotta know his limitations”-Dirty Harry

Big Tuna!!!
Hey look jim

Big Tuna!
GOLDEN FACE
💩💩💩💩💩💩🖕🏻💩🖕🏻💩🖕🏻💩💩💩
The UK version was better.
Looks like trash. Glad I pay for netflix instead of Amazon.
Threat Level: Midnight
what up, Big Tuna?
The Dunder Mifflin accounts?
This looks dumb. Just make a movie true to his book series. Like a true to book movie of without remorse
Being tased does not knock you unconscious...Why do so many movies and TV shows portray it that way?
What happened to jim
Don't know what this is or why it's trending but I have one question Amazon.. why did ya'll cancel Z The Beginning Of Everything season 2?
lol this dork is worse than Sam Worthington, who keeps casting him?
I only tend to binge if it's a certain show. I binged a lot of the OA because I was completely hooked. Other shows I try to do one or two episodes at a time to save it. I've binged stuff in the past and then been sad that it was over so quickly.
idk binging leaves me feeling super guilty about all the time that I could have spent doing other stuff like going out or studying or something. That's why i need a tv show to be absolutely brilliant and worth it for me to binge.
Watch Designated Survivor. It is the best show out right now. S1 is ready to binge watch but S2 is currently coming out week by week on Netflix and tbh I love it. It gives me something to look forward too every Thursday, I watch it with my mum but it's so good that I'll watch it ahead because I can't wait and then watch it again with her. Fucking good show. Enjoy the anticipation and speculation between episodes
I tend to binge watch because: \n1) I forget to tape episodes or tune in when they're on \n2) I have other things to do when the show originally aired, so it's just easier to watch them all at once after the season is over and not end up watching episodes out of order. \n3) There are no or very few commercials when binge watching. \n4) I don't have time to forget the story line from one week to the next.  \n5) It feels more like watching a very long movie that is rich with details when I binge watch. \n6) It takes time to watch a whole season from beginning to end, so in some ways feels like the kind of engrossment level I get when reading a great book. \n7) I often don't even hear about a new show until mid-season or so when people start raving about it, so binging it once it finishes allows me to catch up on what others are recommending.\n8) I feel like I accomplished something when I watch that last episode. #goals\n9) It was a show that came on HBO or some other service I didn't have when it first aired, so I binge it when I'm able to access / buy it.\n10) It's fun. :)
Binging is necessary....... especially in the cold weather ❤️😊
I don't really binge watch, but once a week is definitely not enough. I like to watch 1 episode per day. If you make me wait a week (or even better: 6 months, like amazon is apparently doing) I end up forgetting about it. I used to watch buffy with my mom, but when she got a new work schedule it became harder to watch together and to this day I still haven't finished the last season (for one thing I forgot which episode/disc I'm at) ._.
Without using ur mobile date Lol Idc I've got that unlimited shit boi.
I don't like to binge at all. I used to but a problem that I encountered is that to me personally no show feels special anymore. A big part of the fun of a show is the hype before and the happy feeling I'm left with after the episode. If I watch a complete season at once it feels like having a really good expensive cup of coffee, putting a funnel in my mouth and drinking the coffee in one sip.
I watch about 1% of the amount of movies/tv now that I'm in a relationship. Oh, and MON season 2 is BRILLIANT! A black and white, all Italian ep?!! Awesome.
I binge for two kind of opposite reasons which is weird... Like, when I was unemployed I would binge because I had nothing to do. I had nobody to stop me sitting there and binging all 6 seasons (it was 6 at the time) of Game of Thrones if I wanted to. \nNow I binge because I'm busy with uni, YouTube, friends and family. I can't know that I'm going to be available every Wednesday night. So I'll save up some episodes and binge them all at once. Or better yet, with Attack on Titan, I'm waiting till I have a spare weekend and I'm going to binge the whole second season. (That only works with stuff like anime though, because if it was something like Game of Thrones there would be too many spoilers.)
first thing I binge watched was Lost. I think we do it or at least I do it, because its a better way to experience it. You are 100% into the story and the world when you binge watch. Only one episode a week is limiting. I prefer it when it airs weekly because I don't have time to binge watch and im too weak not to but the experience is enhanced when youve spent the last 7hours inside the same universe.
I binge on shows but I because I spend so much time in that world and with those characters I end up getting tired of it. Loads of shows have 4+ seasons and I've noticed that I become a bit of a tv commitaphobe.  It just becomes predictable or the characters/plot get annoying. It's probably why I tend to prefer bbc dramas.
I don't watch TV, but I do watch youtube for hours
The only things I can fully binge by myself are things that don't require much focus so I can multitask otherwise I feel like I'm procrastinating, so like Pokemon (yea I'm 2 decades old and what that shit's great) I watch while I'm doing the practical side of my costume course, and the best one actually was when I had to pull an all nighter to finish a piece of costume jewellery in time for presentation the next day so I stuck The Mighty Boosh on, got through every season and finished at like 7am just in time to pack everything up ready for uni... The result was a really feckin surreal bus ride after Noel Fielding's mind had become my normality
Have you seen Harlan Coben's The Five on Netflix? SO GOOD. I can't believe nobody is talking about it... I lost an entire day to it and I don't regret it.
I'm one of the weirdos who watches TV as it airs, it's always been something that we've done as a family and it feels wrong not to, there always seems to be a drama or comedy series on and we tend to plan our nights based around TV, e.g. We have nothing to watch on Thursdays so homework/housework/paperwork can go on uninterrupted OR we can go to bed earlier on Wednesday and watch that show Thursday. While it's amazing when you can binge a series I still quite like the wait for a new episode, it keeps my attention piqued and helps to get my brain going - since I've not watched it back to back I have to pay attention. I do tend to go back later and binge the entire series in one go but with a little brother and A levels for me spreading things out works better with schedule, especially when I feel like others are relying on me being done so THEY can watch TV. \n\nI also really miss the water cooler effect, talking about TV was the best fuckin thing and now it doesn't happen, major regrets.
My only way of watching shows is through binge to be honest, my job is pretty full on 5 days a week, sometimes more and obviously on my days off I try to make plans with people I haven't seen in months because of my job, so I miss a lot of aired shows, so when I find time (9/10 at stupid o'clock in the morning) is when I actually be able to watch the shows I plan to, my to watch list of shows is near enough impossible to accomplish at the moment, I don't have time to sit and watch aired shows because I'm not at home when they do 😂, but yeah that's my reason on binging, this might be interesting it might not to your points on binging but oh well 😂😂
I binge watch so much! I hate it when social media spoils it. Depending on the day and the amount of a level work I have to do then I will watch all day
My first binge was Charmed box sets about 9-10 years ago. I like to think I've come a long way since then...
I watch things sporadically, usually a couple of episodes back to back but I don't think I've ever watched an entire series of something in one go
I can never do more than three episodes in a row bc I get restless and bored, no matter how good the series is :/
It's weird but I find that the length of one episode defines whether I binge something or not. If it's under 30 minutes, yes. But any longer like 40 or 45? No. I can't do it. It either has something to do with my existentialism or attention span. I get bored or feel like too much time is passing. But watching 4 twenty minute episodes feels fine, but not 2 40 minute episodes. I think it's that feeling of accomplishment. But then again, I don't know shit.
We used to go to the pub and binge .  .  social . .  ness.
The only series I sort of binged is Stranger things, in two sitting. I'm not really a binge person, for some reason I can't bring myself to watch more than 2 episodes of anything consecutively, though i'm not watching anything as it airs either... i guess i'm just a slow watcher in general
Restraint? Ha! I laugh in the face of restraint! Well I mean I would if I could see it, all I can see now are bright, rectangular lights.
You have to disclose that this is an ad in the title. Great video as always :)
I think you skimmed over impatience - our society and lifestyle is so fast paced that we've lost a lot of patience and I think that contributes to why we binge.\n\nAlso - Jack, have you ever watched the Spiderman cartoons? They were a part in my childhood and I've definitely binge watched them at some point.
my concentration is just not enough to binge watch an entire series, i usually give up after two or three episodes
Yeaaaah I sometimes find binging exhausting to the point I get bored with the series. I unfortunately did that with the last season of Orange Is A New Black but then there are shows like glee that I spent all of my free time on. So I don't know the rule but I guess sometimes when the series is too long it's better to watch it with a little breaks just to enjoy every part of it 😆
I find it fascinating how socially accepted it is even though we use the word binge. Binge is usually used to describe illnesses e.g. binge eating or binge drinking. I'm doing my dissertation on binge-watching and the psychological effects it has on our behaviour so this was an interesting video
We've all been there
i usually binge stuff on really busy days, when I have a lot of chores around the house like cleaning or ironing clothes, repetitive chores you don't have to devote a lot of brainspace to. but it's usually an easy show or audio book i listen to, that lets you not be 100% concentrated to it and not miss anything. OR I binge stuff on days I feel bad or sick, but then I need something more immersive that doesn't let me think and tune out, so my mind is occupied. otherwise, I'm not a fan watching an episode per week, because I feel it waters the show down
Honestly, I don't binge tv shows. Not because I restrain myself, but because if I watch more than 2/3 episodes (depends on the show and length of episode) a day my brain gets so full of that show I'll constantly dream about it at night, to the point that I'm half awake and kind of rewatching the show in my head, and I'll spend all day thinking about it too. So I just don't watch too much of a show, generally :'). \n\nBut maybe 2-3 episodes a day is also bingeing? It is compared to watching 1 show a week, but my friends will sometimes watch 8 episodes a day when they like a show so compared to them, I'm very mild. When are you really bingeing a show? How many episodes within how short a timeframe would be bingeing?
first thing i binge watched was the simpsons like i used to collect all the boxsets from second hand stores and sit there and watch entire seasons. mostly i now bingewatch when doing something like cleaning or studying as 'background noise'. its actually quite hard for me to be at home and not have the tv or my laptop playing something as i tend to feel immense boredom
my first 'binge' was Heroes. All my mates were a few eps before the finale and raving on about it, so I caught up with them so I could have something to talk about.
I would be so annoyed if my sister watched prison break without me.
I think the first thing I binged was iCarly when Nickelodeon did a marathon of it haha
When you're bullimic and constantly ask yourself this
I have no self control, jack #bingeall
I take issue with the spoilers bit, you yourself did that one twitter with Game of Thrones on an episode that I had not yet seen which you then ruined  part of the plot of. If you are going to be critical of others Jack, don't be hypocritical.\n\nThanks\n\nA viewer
I am not good at binge watching on my own... I get distracted easily... but doing it with a friend or my parents, no problem!
I'd almost always wait for the full season to be released and just binge because I'm sort of impatient when it comes to series especially if they have cliffhangers at the end of each episode like I ain't tryna wait a week to find out
Throwing in a bit of media theory in there eh jack? I’m just so pleased I got what you meant  😂
I one time watched the first season of PLL in one sitting. Like 22 hours of content. It was a bet with my friend to see if we could do it (she watched it with me) but yeah. It’s simultaneously the best and worst time I binged something 😂
Certain shows that I watch are too exciting to only watch one episode at a time, it's like a book you can't put down, but we don't refer to that as binge reading
I was a little confused before this started, because I thought this video might be a talk about mental illness
I make sure to always have a few series that have episodes coming out every week as well as some series I can binge watch simultaneously. So that I have some shows to look forward to, but also the option to binge whenever I feel like it.
Net neutrality out the window. Did you even think about what you were promoting before you accepted the money for it? Pretty poor from you.
My friend trinity does this thing where she is convinced that she suggested the show to you. Shows like oitnb, 13 reasons why, stranger things and atypical. She is convinced that she told me to watch all them and gets a satisfaction from it. So the only way to let her know that she hasn’t persuaded my tv show choices I must watch them when they come out. Forcing me to take a day off school every time Orange is the new black releases a new series.
My bingeing keeps getting more and more ridiculous - just finished all 102 episodes of Suits in 3 weeks (highly recommend btw for anyone considering), and already looking for the next thing. It’s kind of strange but I like having something there in the background to ... fall back on? Like, if I’m doing the ironing, or I’m having an early night, or there’s a long journey ... I like integrating a show into my life, which probably means I’m missing something else right now, but yeah. It’s strangely comforting and I’m trying to find something to fill the void right now haha.
this season of GoT was the first season i've watched as it aired and really the only show i've watched live and it was so much fun, i loved going to work and everyone had watched it\nbut realistically unless a show is a hugely popular as GoT it's not really possible for the 'water cooler' conversation to work anymore? at least not by episode i don't think
I agree with what you said Jack and that study is so interesting! My partner would never get away with getting ahead of me in a show we are both watching, my mum is lucky I didn’t lose it when she got ahead of me in Outlander so yeah wow! \n\nThe last thing I binge watched was Wynonna Earp (finally!) and I did two seasons in two days now that was the last thing I binged and that was about two weeks ago and binged Defenders two/three weeks before so I do monitor and manage my bingeing but I’m always hesitant on shows because if people are like “Yes watch it, it’s amazing, you’ll love it!” I won’t like it as much, happened sadly with House of Cards and a few other shows and I’m quite a hypocrite too because I say that to people so I don’t blame them but I find it so interesting that, that is how my mind works (and possibly others) and the lifestyle that watching television is now! And I love it but living in Australia has its negatives with American tv because we have to illegally download or wait for DVD or until Netflix puts it on. So in Australia (and I’m sure other countries) Freeform’s Shadowhunters had its episodes uploaded weekly to Netflix so I could watch it, sadly once a week but now days time flies so before you know it you have one day before the new episode. \n\nBut anyway great vid! 👍🏻👍🏻
I have had restraint with rick and morty purely because i didnt want there to not be anymore! Its taken 2 weeks but im finishing it today, its my birthday so why not? That my friends is my restraint maximum😂
what's interesting is how some shows are different when binging - I mean, they clearly were made so differently. Like ER - that is an amazing show, but watching it without commercial breaks is irritating, because they roll back the scene and you are watching the same thing over and over again. That used to be a thing, but it's not anymore. There are also some of those that are so intense it's frustrating to watch, again, because there isn't a commercial break to lighten the tension.
I'm definitely a binge watcher! I wait until the whole season is our before binge watching it over a weekend... i guess it's because you can get enthralled in the series and can feel all the emotions because it's fresh in your head. Sometimes if the series is really good i binge watch it (so i can talk to friends about it) and then go back and watch it again at a slower pace to really enjoy it more... i did this with Riverdale
Absolutely love your videos where you chat about films so it was nice to hear you chat about TV shows as a change 😊 I’m definitely a binge watcher but then I also like the anticipation of watching one a week! Depends on the show I think 🤔
hold the phone. Catastrophe isn't an amazon show. I watched all of season 3 then went back and watched seasons 1 & 2 thinking that the next batch would be ready for me soon enough.
I think I use binging as a form of procrastination
Me, when all episodes of a season come out all at once I don't watch/binge them all at once. I will watch one or two episodes a day until I'm done. The only thing is, I don't like it when people spoil it on social media before I have finished!
My problem is that I get easily distracted. I can't watch more than one or two episodes at a time (and those have to be 30min episodes I can't deal with those 1h long ones) otherwise I'll get bored.
I do it when stressed tbh, so the amount is increasing daily
Yeah ex, why would you watch season 2 of master of none before season1?! I was asleep on the sofa, woke up halfway through the Italy episode, we watched the entire season in a day and then missed the last 20 minutes of the final episode... worst way to watch anything ever!
i like to binge shows ive already watched anyone else do that? like im currently doing that with Supernatural (tho stopped cause two jobs now ugh)
I just plain forget, so when I go to watch it there's a few eps waiting for me and I'll have binge to play catch up before I'm distracted by life again.
I don't... Get binge watching? It took me a month to watch Sherlock (before season 4 was released) and I still haven't finished season 2? 3? Of black mirror. For me, I need time to process every form of media I consume. Black mirror, for example, I watched Shut Up and Dance like months ago and I still haven't started the next episode. This goes with books and movies as well. People binge watching Harry Potter? Can't do it. People reading 7 books a month? Can't do it, even if I did have the time. I think for me, binge watching kind of takes away how much you appreciate the art of it all.
I thought I was the only one who got a little hurt when my partner watches shows without me
i have so much homework to do, but its the holidays and i plan on binge watching something today
Netflix was designed around binge watching. Whenever you finish an episode and you're like, alright that's enough, it'll be like, look at this next episode!
You look like an egg with glasses and pretty great hair
Lol i thought this was gonna be about bingeing as in... Having an eating disorder lol i guess thats just me
I love to binge watch series because this way I'm much more involved into the story and world instead if I just watch one episode a week.
I also binge to destress. The more stressful the day I've had, the more episodes I consume. But I can only watch on t.v series at a time? Committing to more than one series at a time stresses me out.
I hate binging, I stop enjoying it more than 2 episodes in since it gets old, binging just feels like filling time
Been loving your channel recently Jack!!
noone talks about binge reading. We binge read the harry potter books because they were a constant cliffhanger.  Binging is human nature it is a deadly sin (gluttony), but you cant die from too much Harry Potter or Stranger Things.....I hope.
The first several shows I binged (like you before that was the word used) I watched them on DVD, but on DVDs from the library, so I'd only have a week before I had to return the entire season, this was of course back in the pre-uni days when I had the time to watch a whole season in a week. Now I rarely watched shows as they air, there are still a few I record, but I'll typically watch them an hour later, because then I can skip through the commercials. I know I binge because I get impatient and want to keep consuming the media I'm enjoying
When I was sick in bed for a week with pneumonia, I watched a season of a series each day. Best guilty free binge of my life.
Why we Binge is an easy Question! It is because we want NOT TO END the Thing we like!
My aunt and I talked about binge watching recently [esp. with Game of Thrones] and realised that if you watch too much TV in one go, it's either too exhausting or you gradually lose sense of the potential complexities or nuances. Having rewatched s3 of GoT - 10 hours in two days - was exhausting which makes sense.\nI tend to watch two or three hours of TV any given day if I'm watching a show over a period of time. Occasionally I will watch more and lose track of time, so...Whoops.
i watch my shows on my own because my SO doesn't have taste in shows...
No restraint until the last few episodes, then I have almost limitless will power... I waited almost two years between the second last and last episodes of Deadwood because I couldn't stand the thought of having no new episodes to watch.... Maybe that's not restraint though
Personally, I do tend to have quite a fair amount of restraint when it comes to watching shows, especially on Netflix. For example, when new Marvel Netflix series come out, I tend to limit myself to one a day AND stick to it, it seems to give me just enough suspense to wonder what will happen next, but I'm not left waiting too long that I forget the last episode. I have been known on occasion however to erm... break that particular rule haha! Sped through the new BoJack Horseman as quick as I could! I do see both sides of the supposed argument though and I don't think there's really a wrong or bad side. Just comes down to personal preference! :)
The first series I really binged was Avatar the Last Airbender. I got hooked and had to watch it all before the finale came out. Lol
Jack Howard is a  Tottenham Hotspur fan spurs on there to wembley stadium come on you spurs
I watched the first seven seasons of RuPaul's Drag Race in about two or three weeks
liking just coz you referred to hazel as your 'lady friend'
I never actually binge watch tbh
Season 2!!!! yooo
Ahhh, yes... The lady-friend...
Matchsticks
Procrastination - duh.
high ur a-noy-ing
My lady friend 😂😂😂
Very interesting video
“My lady friend”
Funny you mentioned this.... I just found your channel a couple of days ago and I just watched all of your content... Everything since 2009.... Yep...
Why doesn’t it say that it’s sponsored in the thumbnail?
Has my carrier pigeon come by yet, Jack?
Restraint? That's cute. ALL AT ONCE
I don't just binge....i binge them at 1.25x speed with subtitles...... 1.1x speed if i love the show
Is it just me or would you also freak out seeing how that guy treats your brand new Model 3?\n\nUnbelievable how he: \n\n- hammers on the display (it's called touch screen)\n- slams the glove compartment and hitting alloy decor with his phone\n- treats the coat hook\n- slams the charge port\n- puts aero craps on top of each so that they will scratch \n- closes frunk hood with one hand (other video) \n-       slams the doors \n\nPutting a promotion video on YouTube and demonstrating how you treat other peoples property is not a smart idea. Definitely not the place to leave a Model 3 or any other car for detailing.
Why is he so damn ROUGH?
So they said they reducing features to make the Model 3 cheaper yet they put in bullcrap pointless features where you have to roll a little wheel for ages just to move your steering wheel up or down?? Why not just a lever you pull where it adjusts in 2 seconds? they could have brought this car to 30k if they took out silly lazy features
dude, take it easy with the coffeine/coke/speed or whatever. you almost ripped that poor charging door off..
How cheap and shit the new model 3 is lol go get an i3 if u want hi tech Tesla is a joke
Honestly, the interior looks like absolute crap, it looks cheap like an interior of a 20k compact car.
What about the speedo? Thats the only reason why I watched this
You could just use superglue to glue to the bottom of the bumper. (Maybe) if you drill the holes it wouldn't be so bad- well, you're not going to take the license plate off of that car, or else you're not allowed to drive that car on the road.
So much compromises for a car that costs 35k...
so when you hold it before it for two hours and then you expect it to work. reset and then record
Tesla philosophy: keep things simple by making them complicated and distracting to use. The whole industry needs to give up that minimalist shit. Nothing will EVER work better than actual dedicated buttons.
Show us the driving😏
i didnt like the car to much technologic
I’d love to see if those features will still work in 15 years from now
What happened to the good old cars .. now these day you have to get software updates for car like smart phones !not like good old cars but that's kind of awesome !
Why would u want to move the wheel when driving ? wow :P
you should make more youtuve videos. you seem like a very positive and happy person.
man, i'd be pissed
Horrible interior. Otherwise starting to see model 3 on the street and exterior looks great in real life
isn't there supposedly an NDA on these still?
Consumer facing software for the Model 3  won't be feature complete until about middle of 2018. It will be good enough to release for consumer delivery about December or first Qtr 2018 but probably won't be feature complete until later about middle of 2018 to 3 Qtr 2018. Full hardware features aren't expected until about 3 Qtr.
Absolutely should not be adjusting the steering wheel while driving anyway.
Snowflake car
I heard the there is a passenger camera, can you look into it?
And Beta testing of this car starts now....
Piece of crap !!!
that electric steering wheel adjustment only makes sense if you got profiles you can preselect or if the car senses by the key who is getting in and auto adjusts
One advise bud: lighting and more lighting... other than that good Model 3 series. Subs
the interior quality looks plain awful....
Yeah but it adds 10% when you need it
What does he say in 6:35?
They have shitty ass colors , I hate platinum paint, bright gloss looks way better
The only model 3 in depth review is made by the most annoying guy ever... please somebody do reviews about this car
Why is this guy the the only person on the internet with model 3??
Oh wow you in the bay im from Oakland. Just found your channel I love the in-depth stuff on the Tesla. One day I’ll have one.
Get a Leaf......  Better yet, get yourself a chevy......
Minimalism is a positive word
How does the leg room feel in front and rear seats compared to S and X?
Thanks for sharing - FYI 'lighted' is not the past tense of light.
More like lack of features. The Model 3 is a piece of shit. Also whats the song in intro? thanks.
This video is chock full of weapons grade derp...
Did the owner of this car like you f*cking with it like this?
Phone charging cable was installed incorrectly.  High gloss part along leading edge of phone tray slides left to remove.  This reveals proper routing areas for cables.  Route cables then slide trim piece back on.\n\nOh...fyi...trunk release from inside is federal requirement.  They must be visible so they are either lit or glow in the dark.
I think you find if you are small enough to get locked in your frunk that the light actually goes off when you close it. Otherwise it would be on all the time....
Will the frunk open when you press the button inside while driving?
didn't they just change the new iphone charging port?! lolllll why would you put non standardized proprietary charging phone cord in a car.... must be because elon is in love with apple.
Maybe if you pressed the screen even harder things would work better? :)
A trunk/frunk interior release is a US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard. It is required for all cars made after 2000.  People have died in trunks because there wasn't a way to get out until the mandate .... FYI.
As a huge Tesla fan, I love LOVE the concept of over-the-air-updates.  What other car can ship without functionality but then have it magically update later?  Can't wait till they do the radio.
That's a really bad interior.  No thanks.
As a car, this is just terrible. It makes no sense unless you absolutely MUST have an electric car. Which at the moment you don't need.
You could just put a wireless charging pad there
Drill the whole at the bottom of the opening instead.
No, tell us how you really feel about that piano black trim.
Release button in the frunk?  You forgot to insert dead - or semi-dead body joke
Question what is that window on the back deck going into the trunk for?
how many model 3's are going to get smashed because someone wanted to steal that huge tablet
Basically the video tells me that Tesla buyers are beta testers for the company
Its a government regulation to have a release mechanism on the inside of a trunk.
I am not really a big fan of the interior of this car. Not having the dials immediately in front of you is just annoying and overall the lack of buttons, controls, or features makes it look and feel cheap IMHO.
Can you show a full sized carryon in the frunk and a full sized checked bag in the trunk?
frunk inside release button is probably for kids
Tesla said the series 3 don't have it and will not have it either
....like the iPad glued to the dash? Looks out of place.
Is this someone’s car that’s supposed to be getting detailed?
So good filming on the fly! 👍 lovin’ the videos of the model 3 so good a car guys review! not a tech guy who bangs on about the trunk and hubcaps
How do you turn on the turn signals? There doesn't seem to be a turn signal stalk...
a gun, a pistol, a knife cos you know you are psychopath... dude thumbs up just for that Lol xD
This guy is definitely what we call a Grobmotoriker in Germany.
USB means you can use wireless charger of your choice!!
I totally thought this guy was on crack
Where is the spare wheel?
For Android phones and now the iPhone 8/X, are the USB ports the fast charging type ie USB-PD?
Leave it to Tesla to overcomplicate something as simple as the steering wheel adjustments...........
I love Tesla but i´m sorry, i can´t with that interior...
At the rate production is going I am hoping for 2020 on the pre order.
Can the coat hook hold a dead body?
Lol @ “ I haven’t went around feeling coat hooks in cars” 😂😂😂
appreciate the video, but he's kind of annoying and amped up.. definitely rough with the interior and exterior as well.
This dude is trolling way too much with the psychopath shit ._.
Model X has lighted vanity mirrors. They're just super difficult to access.
Watch for sad duckling at 10:18 😄
What self respecting “detailer” tolerates water spots?
Waste of money
Really?No speedometer? Infotainment display is more important I guess
Car looks very cheaply made...
it looks crap
Ugliest car I ever seen
USB Ports.... Ports....
Lighted!!! Illuminated ffs
ugly steering wheel
What's with the unfinished ceiling panel in the trunk? Now I need to go see if my cars have unfinished ceiling trunk panels. At least the metal panels could have been fully painted if not finished. Doesn't that seem a little cheap? What car have you purchased where you can see paint overspray on an unfinished panel? I'd be surprised to see that on any car let alone a Tesla.
My infiniti fx35 has alot more features that this car, i will cancel my deposit soon
The more I see this car the less I like it. Literally looks like a toy car.
Does it have a rear armrest? I know the Model S doesn't have one.
Good lord that interior is horrifying.\n\nThis is the disaster that you get when you let the I.T. Dept design your car interior.  Kill it with fire.
I expected the car to be unsafe and unergonomic because of the lack of a gauge cluster, but now that I've seen the real thing, the left edge of the infotainment screen where the virtual gauges are displayed is close enough to the steering wheel that it shouldn't be an issue. I think they must have either widened it or moved it to the left since the first beta model we were shown a year ago.
Am I the only one who thinks it looks awful both outside and on inside?
Im sure that the premium option would have different trims for the center console, I would want whatever matches the dashboard :)
Can Tesla please let someone *who isn't a FUCKING MORON* do these videos next time?
love breeders forever
I love when I refresh my YouTube subscription page and it's 1993.
What jerks voted this down? Breeders are back!
Just what I needed to start my day! THANK YOU! Welcome back!!!
Give me the album already
Good to know that The Breeders came back to 4AD. This will bring again worldwide exposure the band deserves. Great track! Welcome back Kim, Kelley, Josephine and Jim!
I love it!  Kim Deal I love you forever!!  I've been a fan about that long anyway.  Kisses!  xxx
So excited to see them at Union Transfer on November 6th! Last time I saw them live was opening for Nirvana twice in 1993.
Still got it, unlike the Pixies...
Wots... uh the Deal?
'Wait in the car while mother beats the shit out of Sen. Jack Martins..'
I really dig it!
YES! Now I can stop grumbling that everything new sucks.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH NEW BREEDERS
I like it. sounds like the band off Yes Man
Good song... finally ! I missed good music from Breeders !
It's been a while...
GOOD. GOOD. GOOD. GOOD GOD I NEEDED THAT!
So the breeders are back, so is quicksand. Both sound awesome. \n\nNot really sure where this comment is going. But yeah, cool.
That feeling like when an old friend comes back in your life after hundred years. Kim, 😍
I'm a happy camper!! Looking forward to seeing them in Glasgow. This has made my day.
Love it, stoked for the new record.
holy fuck i needed this! 🔥🔥💘💘⚡⚡
Oh Oh, is this a new album I hear?
makes you wonder why it took them forever and a bit to bring out some new stuff... just to give you the impression, there's nothing more casual to do in the world, once you hear it.\n\nThey found a way to pack all the classical Breeders magic into this 2 minutes, making it as catchy as ever. Kim's always been a goddess in writing short songs with character. She still got it.\n\nim eager to hear more
Nice!!!   Btw. so excited to see you in Berlin in a couple of days :-)
I love you Kim
Love it!!! Classic Breeders. Aging like a fine wine and I like fine wine too ;)
So wonderful, just what I need!
Good song! Thanks for a nice surprise. :)
This is the best way of waking up
GOOD MORNING! This song is *everything*! Made my week/month/year/life.
It's got a good beat https://youtu.be/7g3P18rTFMA?t=1m35s
New Breeders material is welcome in these trying times.
Here are the lyrics I tried to decipher. I am not sure about some parts. Would love suggestions or edits from everyone else.\n\nTHE BREEDERS, WAIT IN THE CAR\n\nGood morning\nConsider I\nAlways struggle with the right word\nMeow, meow, meow-meow-meow\nAs a sinner, I\n(unlock?) nothing that neat\nSinner I\nSinner I\nSinner I\nOh-oh, oh-oh\nMother wants to hold me down\nOh-oh, oh-oh\nWait in the car\nI got business\nForget the sun\nTime to get off, take it or not\nCause strategies for punks\nMother wants to hold me down\nMother wants to hold me down\nGonna chase the stars\nMaking a map, scraping off the sky\nJust to fall back\nSinner I\nSinner I\nSinner I\nOh-oh, oh-oh\nOh-oh, oh-oh\nOh-oh, oh-oh
instant classic! I'm so happy! !!!
pls sir can i have some more
Breeders are back!!!

Good Morning , Buenos Días .
11teenth!\nGood morning!
YES! 💃👑🏆🍩🖤🎸
it hurts a bit to say that but: This song alone is better than the last Pixies record.... its raw, its fun, its 90's but its fresh!
hate to say it but its not much of  song. just sound like a well mastered rehersal jam to warm up. Dissappionted.
Meow meow meow!!
I was 8 when I discovered Cannonball thanks to my dad. I'm 23 and I still want to see them live. Come in France Breeders!
PostGrunge sounds like Burger'n'Fries nowadays
you're back!!!!
Vocals are boring
Miss Shania is back and coming for 2017

Lady director 😍
Que legal explorar esse lado MULHER de Shania... todas nós mulher merece esse estalo de auto analisar e dizer:  É, TÔ MUITO GATA! kkkkkkkkkkkkk , brilha Twain, bjsss de Brasil 😘
I love Shania's new album but I don't think the video for Swingin' does her justice. The lighting and filters were not flattering at all - she looks better in the documentary footage here.
What a pleasure to work with the queen it most be!
Hope you always be best for your song \nWe dan with you
Oh my god shania twain 😃😃😃👏👏👏💖i be so happy if i see her 😃i be OH MY GOD 😃😃😃👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏✨💖👑😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
Til Shania- swingin refers to dancing and not moving hard back and forth on a piece of wood xD
Where is this studio? I think I have seen it before in some Beach Body videos. LOVE YOU SHANIA!
Coming Back to the Stages after a Real Life Tragedies Is  something only legends can DOOOOOOO .......... Love you Shania ... from SYRIA
@ShaniaTwain is absolutely stunning in this video and the butt shot is worthy! You go girl!  The lighting in this video is magnificent. Love it and love #ShaniaNOW
Shania is complete boss! Queen is back and still sexy and awesome! She looks so awesome in that jumpsuit. Love it!
I love how creative and sexy this video is Shania. One of my favourites you look gorgeous. Totally goals 😍 congrats on going platinum in Canada.
Love you shania! From Brazil!
First
Thank you all for the terrific suggestions! gonna polish off that library card and get on the learnin' train, destination: WONDER AND EXCITEMENT, CHOO CHOO
You might find Goatman by Thomas Thwaites amusing: one man's journey to (briefly) become a goat via prosthetics and an artificial goat stomach.
I'm halfway through Devil in the White City, spurred by your conversation with Destin and Matt on the No Dumb Questions podcast (so you haven't technically gone 4.5 years without _some_ kind of book recommendation, I guess...).
Yo, I'm tearing up ALL THE TIME reading Hidden Figures right now.  I assume you've already read it but IT'S SO GOOD.
I'm excited for Caitlin's new book too!!
Here are a few suggestions: Robert Hazen's The Story of Earth, Matt Ridley's Genome, and E.O. Wilson's On Human Nature, one of my favorite books of all time.  Check out Christin O'Keefe Aptowicz' Dr. Mütter's Marvels a biography of the surgeon who founded the Mütter Museum.
Guns, Germs and Steel: A Short History of Everybody for the Last 13000 Years by Jared Diamond (although its 20yrs old so may not qualify). Also Some We Love, Some We Hate, Some We Eat: Why It's So Hard to Think Straight About Animals\nby Hal Herzog. Apparently I like listed titles with explanatory subtitles...
Hehehe I’m going to Caitlin’s book reading today, I’ll mention this video and how much a collaboration would be amazing!!!
thank you so so much for the recommendation by Lace Grande. Loving it just as much as Richard Fortey's Dry Store Room No.1
“The Man Who Found Time” is a phenomenal book about the life and times of James Hutton and the history of geology! If you’re interested in history of science, Scotland, or how those things molded early geology, this is for you!
I also want to be in a book!\n\nThanks for the recommendations, I will keep 'em in mind. :-)
Mrs. Harkness went to China to bring back a panda because her husband was killed while pursuing one. she wanted to finish his goal for him. it's a love story.
Still Life, Melissa Milgrom. It's about the history of taxidermy and taxidermy competitions in America. She went to the World Championships too!
My boyfriend and I want to get his 4 year old niece into science. We are into science and we want to share our love for it with her.  What books would you recommend? She is into animals like any 4 year old.
I love deaths acre, it's about/ by bill Bates and the development of the field of forensic anthropology
Have you read Miss Leavitt's Stars: The Untold Story of the Woman Who Discovered How to Measure the Universe?
I *loved* Smoke Gets In Your Eyes!  I just got From Here to Eternity :3
I've missed you, emily.
That was an awesome episode. Great recommendations, your enthusiasm is contagious! I read Lab Girl last Christmas, I really appreciated the insight into the life of a researcher.
I loved Smoke Gets In Your Eyes! I'm reading her new book From Here to Eternity and it's fantastic. Her death positive work has really changed how I view the logistics of death.
Since we're all recommending books here, I would like to add Blood and Guts: the history of surgery. It's so, so good, so interesting and it makes me SO happy that I live today with all this technology in medicine.
The Invention of Nature by Andrea Wulf is a must read!!!
I've had Smoke Gets in Your Eyes on my to-buy list for ages now, and I had no idea the author had a YouTube channel! Thanks for that! :D
Hey Emily! You should check out Parasite Rex by Carl Zimmer!
4:26 mike wazowski I’m in a Magazine!
I'm sure you've already read The Sixth Extinction... it may have been in your last video in fact, lol. But I recommend that to everyone. \n\nI have to thank you for this from the perspective of an English teacher. My students were just asking how anyone could enjoy nonfiction books and I told them they just hadn't found the right one. I have plans to show them this video and get them more excited about nonfiction. And I think I'm going to have them pick one from your list for me to read, too! (I hope for the poison one or the ask a mortician one, her channel is great!) Thank you for promoting reading!
My last book was The Radium Girls: The Dark Story of America's Shining Women by Kate Moore.  While not heavy in the science area it talks about the radiation exposure the girls endured while painting the luminous dials on instruments.  Their treatment will make you upset at the establishment.   Another great book which is heavy in science is The Gene: An Intimate History by  Siddhartha Mukherjee.  A great read for the history of inheritance from the beginnings to the future.   Both are great reads.
I really love the way Sagan used to write about science
Lol the only books I read are comics why am I watch this
OMG YES YOU AND CAITLIN!!!!! That would be amazing!!!
Read Archie Carr's The Windward Road and So Excellent A Fishe!! The Windward Road is about his field studies as a herpetologist in the Caribbean in the 40s and 50s. So Excellent A Fishe is about early sea turtle research and conservation. They are both really entertaining and insightful. I really enjoyed reading about the first time they put a tracker on a turtle in the 60s and the struggles they had to deal with. They ended up tying a rope from the turtle to a float to which they tied a weather balloon with a radio transmitter. Turned out the transmitter had such short range that they could see the balloon before they could tap in on the transmitter.
emily you are just a joy to watch
I'd recommend Spillover! (By David Quammen). It's about all the different zoonotic diseases. It's sooooo good it's like a detective story trying to find out where they come from. If you're not keen on reading the whole thing (not that it's very long) he released an updated excerpt on Ebola after the 2014 episode which is also AMAZING. A couple of my non-science friends read the excerpt and loved it!
The two books i recommend are The best that money can't buy- Jacque Fresco and The new human rights movement - Peter Joseph
I would have loved to have worked in something to do with evolution 😩
Yes! I love Caitlin Doughty! Everyone should check out Ask A Mortician on YouTube!
I recommend Osa and Martin: For The Love Of Adventure by Kelly Enright. It's a peek into the lives and works of a couple whose adventures (mostly Africa and the South Pacific) influenced how people thought about the world through their pictures, films, and lectures. I liked it because their decision to change from hunting to photography helped influence global conservation efforts, and getting a glimpse into their lives was a fun and educational experience. Hope you enjoy if you decide to check it out!
Kingdom Under Glass by Jay Kirk. It's about Carl Akeley and the advancements he made in the field of taxidermy along with his safaris he did to collect specimens.
I enjoy all your videos kid, you never let me down! Keep up the good work! Oh, Dr. Bakker's book, Raptor Red was a real favorite of both my kids.
I would recommend The Man Who Touched His Own Heart by biologist Rob Dunn. It's about the history of medical science and the advances that heart sugary has made. I would also recommend Refuge by Terry Tempest Williams (I'm currently reading this one right now). It's about the rise of the Great Salt Lake and the effect it has on the environment and bird refuge that it overtakes, also the authors story of her mother's battle with cancer.
I refuse to believe Jamie James is the real name of an actual person.
OMG CAITLIN DOUGHTY!!!! I love that you recommended her book. I adore her. PLEASE DO A COLLAB!!!!
I think that you should read Lab Girl by Hope Jahren! It is a really good book about botany, mental health, and friendship. I cried.
I love A Sting in the Tale by David Goulson, it's all about bees! He also wrote A Buzz in the Meadow which is amazing if you want to learn about bees AND bugs. If you wanna get into some fiction, Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeer has some pretty wicked biology in it!
I just bought poisoner's handbook : ) thanks for the recommendation.
I'm more of a history buff than a natural science kind of person if you're interested in books like that
I'd say 3 of my favorite non-fiction sciencey/natural world kind of books would be Beast in the Garden, No Way Home: The Decline of the World's Great Animal Migrations, and Tiger: A True Story of Vengeance and Survival
I hope I die an environmentally friendly death
VS Ramachandran's 'Phantoms in the brain' is amazing!!
You should read Neil Degrasse Tyson's new book Astrophysics for People in a Hurry....or his other book on Pluto becoming a dwarf star.
I think you would enjoy Your Inner FISH by Neil Shubin. It's probably already in the Field Museum bookshop and it will appeal to your interest in paleontology & biology and your inner geek! Enjoy the read and thank-you for the videos. Sharing and communicating the spirit of science is so important, so valuable and so rarely done this well.  Way to go !
I really enjoyed Lab Girl by Hope Jahren! Also 10/10 would support a Caitlin/Emily cross-over!!
YouTube literally just recommended ask a mortician to me a few days ago and I've been binge watching her videos every chance I get... So, yeah, a collaboration would be awesome.
Emily/Caitlin collaboration would make my life complete! LET'S TALK ABOUT DEAD STUFF!!
If you're ever in the mood for fiction I recommend A Natural History of Dragons by Marie Brennan. It's a great fantasy that reads like a Victorian memoir. It's soooo good!
Have you read Annihilation? It's pretty great in terms of weird sci-fi.
Ooo I love a good book review. If you make one in the future I'm looking for recommendations for reading about evolution that aren't a textbooks but are more in depth than say Richard Dawkins's stuff.
I would watch the heck out of a video with you and Catilin Doughty.
Book recommendations for you:\nGrandmother Fish, by Jonathan Tweet. Illustrated children's book introduces evolution to younger readers. \n\nPlanet of the Bugs, by Scott R. Shaw. Shaw covers the story of arthropods from their beginnings to today. It's clear from his writing that he admires his subjects very much. Fun, informative read. \n\nWasp Farm, by Howard E. Evans. Stories from Evans about a farm he owned and the various species of wasps who inhabited the farm. Evans really admires wasps and makes the reader love them too. This is one I re-read every few years.\n\nAnd yes, yes, PLEASE do a Brainscoop-Doughty crossover.. I'm a fan of both of your channels.
Now I want to read that graphic book about dinosaurs!
I recommend A Primate's Memoir by Robert Sapolsky-- really good field biology focused nonfiction about baboons! Bring many tissues for the ending.
I love this channel! The only one I've read is The Snake Charmer and it was fantastic. If you haven't read it, Dinosaurs in the Attic by Douglas Preston (about the American Museum of Natural History in New York) is wonderfully written and very interesting!
Now i want to read the murder mystery book! Also this vid is so insightful in areas I usually don't encounter on youtube, so I like it a lot!
ahaha, here have these books they made me cry!
Sorry,   more recommendations because I love science writing. The Earth Remade by Oliver Morton is a good overview of geoengineering schemes to combat global warming. The Sixth Extinction by Elizabeth Kolbert has already been mentioned, but if anyone wants a older but longer read on the same topic, I recommend David Quammen's Song of the Dodo. The Ends of the World by Peter Brannen, about mass extinction, is another to read book on my list, but I've heard good things and was impressed by the author during one of his presentations. And as for another non-fiction dinosaur comic, Science Comics' Dinosaurs: Fossils and Feathers is another good choice that focuses more on the history of paleontology (although I did find a couple errors in the book.)
So good to have another set of book recommendations- I treated myself to a fair few from your last list. I've already got 'Smoke gets in your eyes' and I agree a collab with Caitlin would be awesome. Would recommend the Morbid Anatomy Anthology for more weirdness and 'GoatMan' by Thomas Thwaites, subtitled 'how I took a holiday from being human'. Science, biology, humour and great photos.
Mites live in your face\nNo wonder people have acne.
I had to read Monster of God by David Quammen for a class and I was very surprised about how much I enjoyed it. It's about the relationship between humans and predator animals. It talks about how different cultures view the relationship and how it affects humanity as a whole. A very interesting read- I highly recommend!
A book I plan on reading that I'm sure you will like is Dr. Lee Dugatkin's new book How to Tame a Fox (and Build a Dog) . Coincidently, I heard about this book on the podcast Talk Nerdy and the very next episode is with Caitlin Doughty, whose channel I just discovered and now I'm seeing everywhere.  The internet is a small world.
I'm currently reading Into the Jungle: Great Adventures in the Search for Evolution by Sean B. Carroll. Pretty good so far!
I am reading Blood, Sweat and Pixels ! It's a great narration over the life cycle of game development and of game developers.
Plague On Us by Geddes Smith\nThe Power Of The Charlatan by Grete de Francesco \nHunger and History by E. Parmalee Prentice
I would love to see you get together with Caitlin for a collaboration video!
Are you related to the guy who chugs wine and goes on rants?
Smoke Gets in your eyes is awesome.... I just got her new book : from here to eternity... look it up, it just got published :)
I don't know how I feel about this surprise ending.  I typically segregate my mash potatoes and corn.   I will allow it, only on a trial basis!
If you like Smoke Gets in your eyes, I really suggest her new book that just came out From Here to Eternity: Traveling the World to Find the Good Death.
Oh my god. The idea of you and Caitlin making a collaboration sounds so so SO COOL😍! *crosses fingers*
Smoke Gets in Your Eyes is fantastic! Did you know that Caitlin Doughty's second book, From Here to Eternity, just came out? \nAlso some easy to read nonfiction I've loved recently are three books by Dave Goulson, a bumblebee researcher. The books are A Sting in the Tale, A Buzz in the Meadow, and Bee Quest.(incidentally, he also has a youtube channel)
Napoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History by Jay Burreson combines chemistry and it's historical and anthropological significance and it's amazing!
You may not be in a lot of books but you are in many many people's hearts. Thank you for the great book recommendations and for being a proponent for science exploration.
Does anyone have any suggestions for books about either dinosaurs or paleontology in general??
I'd recommend Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari, but not his second book, homo deus. The second book is just a bunch of hot air.
I want to recommend The Sixth Extinction by Elizabeth Kolbert for anyone wanting to read more non-fiction but is intimidated by how dry it can get sometimes. I thought this book was so well-paced and fascinating and funny that I didn't have any trouble getting through it. It was insightful and I learned a lot from it!
Always on the look out for good non-fiction, and Poisoner's Handbook is now on my wish list! I recently read The Sixth Extinction by Elizabeth Kohlberg, and it was so eye opening! I recommend it to everyone hoping to understand a little more the impact of humanity on the rest of the animals on our complex Earth. Also just read Concussion by Jeanne Marie Laskas, and wow, now I have to read Dr Omalu's book.  Please keep doing the book recommendations!
The Hidden Life of Trees by Peter Wohlleben really helped me think differently about every tree around me, and was a quick, happy read.
I just got my copy of Smoke Gets in Your Eyes today! How funny
Emily's seemingly never-ending collection of animal jewelery must itself almost be worthy of inclusion in the Field Museum.\nThe count for todays video is, I believe, 4:\nMain segment:\n• Ring - curled Pangolin (?)\n• Brooch Chain - Flying wasps/beetles (?)\n• Earrings - Dragonfly wings\nCutaway flashback to interview with Lance Grande\n• Earrings - Flys\n\nAlways some little detail to notice.
Another funny nerdy girl... Yes please\n\nYay, more crushing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.....😒\n\n\n\n👉😞
I recommend Longitude by Dava Sobel.
Mary Roach!
Nice list
Buck. BUCK all those societal norms...
first vsauce michael tweeting about caitlins book...... now emily 🙏
talk show
Emily... do you have a Goodreads?
The mites that live in your face... Excuse me while I freak out for a minute before researching this more heavily than the research paper I have due in the morning.
Tell us where you get your skulls! That's what I really want to know!
For some weird reason YouTube hasn't notified me of an Emily video in at least six months. Then this one popped up. I'll have to go back to see what I missed.
Thank You, Emily! Sorry, as a fellow female wearer of shirts, wanted to know what is that cute chained thing on your shirt?
Brother, I wish you achieve the success you deserve. You make really great music
I can relate so much. Both of my parents are so disconnected it just makes the rest of us feel that way too. I don't really consider them as my parents anymore but just as two more people in the house. I once wished we could fix our relationship like they did in the video but after years of mistreatment, I stopped caring. Sorry for the long comment, I'm a big fan of Jacob Banks. His songs and music videos are always on point, he deserves more recognition for the art he puts out.
Jacob Banks... stop. Now. There's only so much room in my playlist for a single artist. This isn't right. You're *too* good
I'm a simple guy, if i see a jacob video i like it
guys! omg f ree amazon gift cards from here ➜ lythu.com/giftcardsgiveaway?137387163
Still confused as to how you're not crazy popular!!!
U got a music video that u wearing a white t-shirt in
This brother is more profound than life itself.his music makes me urge of having a course in life
Love me some chess!  The game that bonds us!?!
So beautiful, the song and the video really compliment each other
Damn he's good wasn't expecting that
I can’t wait for his beautiful music to start blowing up everywhere.. both his voice and his lyrics are out of this world 😭❤️
Keep doing what you are doing Jacob Banks. Great song.
Been a long time fan of him and even I was not prepared for the emotion on display here. His voice is unreal, his lyrics are surreal, he embodies soul.

Im disappointed tbh. I mean its not awful but these two could've made something wayy catchier. Dawsin's Breek I feel like only appeals to certain people.
DID U REALLY JACK LANZE'S STYLE?
This song makes me wanna do inappropriate things
This song makes want to masturbate then go an watch porn
lol. video took about 3 hours to film with just taking place at a strip club and smoking and twerking. took two days to put together. Very original... never the less good song.
This song makes me want to force a dude to suck my dick even though I'm straight.
I love this crasy sexual fantasy - Ty4ever.
2:27 and everything Zombie got real sexy
Why this nigga in strip clubs for all his songs?
Take jeremih off the song, half ass verse
are we expecting a debut?
This be bouncin in my car
One of them is Nina Ross
What the fuck was that Jermiah? Did you sneeze on the track by accident and they put your name on there? Only good part of this song was the chorus and it’s just for the electronic keyboard in the BG. I love Ty but jesus man this was fucking weak for the beat potential
This is actually so fucking bad.
Sup with the sound quality...big tune tho
i love dolla sign and jeremih but this shit sucks
Ty always stays ahead of the game
I just got designed with tribal paint and surrounded by Aztec women through this beat .🔥🔥
Jeremih is to much for mee😢
This song make me wanna call my landlord and ask for rent money.  #Dawsin's Breek
The beat in this song goes Skrrrrra
this  song makes me to buy a sunglas and look again the video
this song makes me want to eat a burger with a fork and knife
FUCK! IT IS GREAT! VERY GOOD! NICE!
Best song on the year !! 100%,лучшая песня в этом году и клип топ

HAVANA OH NA NA
Can confirm you screamed at the TV.
The Good Place is one of the most clever comedies I've seen in a while and I LOVE it, I've been watching Bojack Horseman and it's awesome, also an oldie but a goodie is Leverage!
So should this be titled as an AD?
HAZEL!!! If you loved Buffy, I think you should watch Agents Of Shield. Joss Whedon is a part of it and I just love the characters so much... In my opinion, it gets better and better and I have teared up so many times with this show. I just really love it, maybe you'll like it too!
So English is not my mother tongue but i understand it enough. And I am watching videos on my phone. And even though it's sound level is full i hardly understand your videos. I am no way an expert but i'd rather you do some tinkering over the sound system? Dodie's videos are kinda same too. But for example I don't have this problem with Jack's videos.
an anime recommendation: FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. My all time favourite show. I've got a lot of friends who don't like anime shows but they've always enjoyed this one. If you don't particularly enjoy listening to Japanese dialogue, it's got a great English dub too.  It's insane how well written it is.
Please Like Me is a masterpiece
Watch Designated Survivor. I cannot stress how incredible the show is enough. The premise is that a terror organisation (not ISIS) blows up the US Capitol during the State of the Union Address taking out almost everyone leaving Tom Kirkman who was the designated survivor in the event of a mass attack to become President. \nIt is the most gripping TV show I have ever watched, I binged the first 6 episodes of S1 until I caught up and had to watch real time and the suspension between episodes is so much fun. Pretty much every episode has an amazing cliff hanger that isn't just there for the sake of it, it's necessary and is just fucking beautiful WATCH DESIGNATED SURVIVOR I BEG YOU
you've got so much presence on camera. it's almost like we're having an actual conversation. also i love how passionate you are about films and shows and how you analyse them so well.
Everyone should binge PrankMe. Just saying. I've watched it 3 times. I can't deal with how great it is okay
how to get away with murder is amazing!
i accidentally watched all of Glow in 1 afternoon/night
IVE SEEN THEM ALL!!!! \nWE are so ALIKe! <3<3
1 - It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia \n2 - Brooklyn 99\n3 - Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt
Last show I binged was Harlan Coben's The Five. Lost a whole day. Totally worth it. Told Jack to binge it too... hehe
Glow is amazing and a second season has been confirmed.
I'm sure you've said you've watched it (now that I think about it, that may be why I did haha) but Lovesick is so good to binge, maybe to keep up with the timeline, but I love the character development so much - it's great to get sucked into.
shows I've been binge watching lately.\n\n1. PrankMe - Cheers @ChewingSand for such a great little psychological horror/black comedy. I laughed, I cringed, there were some rather audible holy shit moments. Fantastic stuff\n\n2. Blood Drive - Batshit insane love letter to 1980's grindhouse cinema\n\n3. Wentworth - If you've seen Prisoner (Cell Block H for the UK folks) this updates that kind of women's prison drama beautifully. Can't wait for series 6
Only 9%. People have lied.
I'm a bit disappointed guys. Scrolled through all the comments and probable the best show I have ever seen never mentioned. \nEveryone should really try The Newsroom. Imo it probably has the best pilot episode of all the shows I have seen. I watched it 3 times already and I will watch it at least 3 times more in the next 10 years (the whole show, not just the pilot). The cast is amazing, the writing is on point, the characters are all so in depth and work together like PB%J. The series are about A fictional news station that does coverage on actual news that happened in real life while trying to uphold the highest jornalistic standarts. I cant imagine anyone who would quit the series after trying the first 3 episodes.  \n\nAlso watch Arrested development and Speechless\nMost of the other good stuff was already mentioned so im not going to repeat it.
if you liked rick and morty i think you would like bojack horseman!! it's in the same genre of cartoons for adults but it's a lot more emotionally mature and does some really interesting commentary on celebrity culture!\nalso, i know how you feel about getting sad when you finish binging a show. i'm procrastinating watching the last season of 30 rock because i don't want it to end :(
My favourite shows\n1. Parks and Rec\n2. The IT Crowd\n3. Survivor \n4. Would I Lie to You
Brooklyn 99 is incredible and I really think you would enjoy it
i cannot recommend brooklyn nine nine enough honestly it has fantastic representation, it’s hilarious without relying on stereotypes or being offensive and it never fails to make me smile! also black mirror if you want intense amazing terrifying sci fi drama, and if you like rick and morty i would definitely recommend gravity falls ❤️
I really enjoyed Love! And watching Glow rn as well. Maybe will try Rick and Morty.
SKAM! You can literally watch all four seasons in 12 hours
Glow is great. :) \nAlready watched it, really great!\n\nThe second show you talked about, I don't know. \n\nRick and Morty i obviously know, but don't really like so much.\nThanks for your video. :)
You know me, I’m reverse giraffe. I’ve got a short neck and legs.
Please watch Crazy Ex-Girlfriend if you haven't already. It's a musical, it's incredibly written and the characters are so wonderfully flawed and the cast is brilliantly diverse. It is so incredible, and everyone should watch it (and binge it!) it's so underrated and Rachel Bloom is SO talented. And it's all on Netflix and season 3 starts next week.
omg you put how I feel about Love into words! I keep wondering why I actually like it seeing as I don't like either of the mains all too much but yeah their relationship is just really cool to watch unfold
I threw my hands up in the air when Hazel started with GLOW because I tell everyone to watch it but no one listens to my amazing recommendations!
If your up for a full on binge-\n\n1.) Supernatural, it's about two brothers who hunt demons and other monsters and creepy stuff together. They're best friends with an angle by season 4 and it is hilarious, spooky and emotional and some points (yes it has 12 going on 13 seasons but it's totally worth it and so addictive, you'll fall in love with not only the show but also the characters and actors who play them)\n\n2.) Gilmore Girls, it's about a mother and a daughter who are best friends and their lives in their little town (it includes 8 seasons including the newer version, with the same cast of course..there is so much to love about all the characters)\n\n3.) American Horror Story, every season is a different creepy story which involves some sort of clown, ghost or different creepy thing (there are currently 7 seasons and it's freakishly great and trust me, it's worth it just to see Evan Peters being his usual gorgeous self)
I think you HAVE to watch One Day At A Time. That show was absolutely brilliant. It's a sitcom but all the while it manages to call out important issues like racism and sexism and searching for identity. It has an almost all female of colour cast with only one straight white guy. It's funny and real and just absolutely wonderful.
new girl!!!! all characters are SO well written and perfectly casted. Also brooklyn nine-nine and the crown!!!
my favorite recent binges\n1. big mouth (surprisingly super good and well written and clever)\n2. crazy ex girlfriend (so addicting, always takes the humor over the edge which is really entertaining)\n3. bojack horseman (don't even know where to begin it's amazing just watch it)
I KNEW Rick & Morty would be in here. It so fab and I must admit I did think 'this is something Hazel would like.' Interesting to hear you describe it though. I've tried to explain it to my friends/family/boyfriend/anyone that will listen and why they should watch it but it's so hard to describe! It's crazy smart, incredibly hilarious and then in the next second, so so dark. It's such a 'you have to see it to believe it' show! 💚👌
Have you seen the show Community? You mentioned Gillian Jacobs in the second show and I know that Alison Brie is in Glow, they're both in a sitcom called Community, it's amazing.
oh Hazel you are such a perfect combination of that old lady on the train who will try to convince you of how great that movie form the 60's is and that way younger than anyone chill aunt who will never miss an opportunity to have a party
For anyone who hasn't yet seen it, you should binge The Wire. It's one of the most real and brutally honest shows ever. It's complex and thrilling at the same time.
you should watch Crazyhead it's a Netflix original, Its so funny!
sense 8, It's THE MOST amazing show. so well shot and filmed and the cast is amazing, and its funny yet dramatic, and has some amazing fight scenes, but also relationships. It's got something for everyone.
my top three are probably\n1) riverdale\n2) series of unfortunate events (the acc tv series)\n3)GLOW\n<333333333 love this :)
THESE ARE 3 OF MY FAVOURITE SHOWS ON NETFLIX WTF HAZEL!!! \n\nDude you HAVE to- and i absolutely mean HAVE to- watch The Get Down, its an incredible series on netflix about underground disco and hiphop (and also kind of drug business) in the bronx in the 70's and its dramatic and its sad and its hilarious and its just everything, its genuinely my favourite show on this planet and its so well-made I absolutely reccomend it to anyone and everyone, especially if you're a fan of the 70's. \n\nThat was a long-ass run-on sentence and I also am just gushing and not reviewing bc im not good at using film terminology, but its seriously so incredibly shot, acted, written, everything. I think any movie buff will appreciate it (it was made like a 12-part movie kinda) so if you read this and choose to watch it please get Jack to watch it too.
I binged Black Mirror a few months ago and I'm just now coming out of a recuperative blanket fort. One of those shows you really can't binge.
Wow Hazel, I know you are in projects & stuff, but man! I've been missing you, thanks :)
I'll be honest, I was slightly disappointed that I've seen and loved all of these shows... although I'm quite happy that we share the same tastes
1. Supernatural\n2. Orphan Black\n3. The 100\n\nI know kinda seems like the usual cliche recommendations, but I swear these shows are absolutely amazing and so much more complex then they may seem!!
I had to put together my website and started watching GLOW in the background only to then take twice as long to finish my website because I was TRANSFIXED by this very strange but lovable show in front of me! And I've been missing them so much the last week and just can't bloody wait for Season 2 to come out!
My shows u should all binge watch!!\n- Brooklyn Nine Nine\n- Hemlock Grove\n- Black Mirror\n- Luther\n- Jessica Jones (only one season as of yet but oh well)\n- Bates Motel\n- Don’t trust the B**** in Apt 23\n- Fresh Meat\n- Atypical\n- Pretty little liars (went to shit in seasons 6 + 7 but the first 5 seasons are worth watching)\n- Fear the Walking Dead\n- The 100\n- Peep Show\n- Jane the Virgin
Other shows: \nI'm also one of those 11% who watches things based on friends recommendations haha. That's how I found Rick and Morty. But I seriously think you'll enjoy Orphan Black as it's (sort of?) an all-female cast(?) and it's incredible. \n1.) Orphan Black\n2.) Brooklyn Nine-Nine\n3.) Top of the Lake
I WISH people would stop using the word binge it is literally an eating disorder
Grace and Frankie is one that I really loved and binged on a lot! Would highly recommend it!
I definitely binge watch waaay too many shows but I’ve never seen Rick And Morty, I will definitely be binge watching it for the next couple of days after watching this video. Also the way you described Love and Glow perfectly summed up my love of both the shows. Thank you
I only watched part of the pilot of Rick and Morty with the whole seed thing, and I stopped, but now I'm curious and want to give it another shot because you like it so much. Rick just irritated the hell out of me!! \nAlright, instead of working after watching this video like I was going to, I'm going to watch a few more episodes.
Enjoyed Glow and love Rick and Morty. Though I watched 1 and a half seasons of Love, (hoping s2 would be better.) And I just found it very meh. \nThere was nothing that really made me want go come back for more,. The comedy seemed to rely on the one aussie flatmate and parts kind of felt like a nerdy dudes wet dream. \nI like Gillian Jacobs as an actress and the basis of Love seem to be a type of show I would enjoy, so I went in with an open mind, but left a little dissapointed.
1. Black Mirror\n2. Orange is the New Black\n3. Prank Me!\nAlso i started Rick and Morty a few weeks ago and im watching season 3. I've tried so hard to savour it because i dont want it to end but today will be the day i finish! It is my birthday after all🎈
unrelated to the video buuut your makeup looks AMAZING
I think you should try Orphan Black. It has amazing acting, and the writing is pretty good, although far-fetched at times. I'm curious to hear what you think about it :)
Atypical. 8 episodes that will make you laugh and cry and everything in between. So amazing, and on Netflix! X
people need to watch please like me!!! it's one of my favourite comedy shows (w/ it's always sunny and the it crowd) and no one talks about it + when it does tackle darker subjects it's done so well. totally binge worthy
10/10 recommend watching You're The Worst!
A show I feel has not got enough attention is This Is Us, it’s just so beautiful and clever and heartwarming and sad (the second season just started but I’m waiting so that I can binge it all)
The Good Place\nSeriously. Kristen Bell plays Eleanor who has died and gone to The Good Place. Except, she's not actually a good person and it was a mistake. Hilarious show. Also, they can't swear in The Good Place, so holy forking shitballs there's a lot of good jokes
okay, i know it's pretty basic, but river dale is coming back soon and i would highly recommend watching it. the main character's plot line is basically the same as troy's from high school musical, but there's also *murder* lol
love... a show about people you don’t like... reminded me of mad men in that way
This show is quite old so you've probably already seen it but genuinely, the L word is SUCH A GOOD SHOW. the characters are so interesting and likeable but also so unlikeable at the same time and it does show the ups and downs of relationships as well and you see relationships that work so well fall apart and no so good ones work together and I could keep going on but I don't want this to be too long. But seriously would recommend
You should binge!  What does that mean in English?
I feel cheated. I've binged and finished all three already!
rick and morty is absolutely the best animated show airing right now, clever, funny, and dark in ways you wouldn't even fucking imagine, the only one that can stand remotely close to its quality is bojack horseman for me. And if people don't know it, broadchurch is on netflix which didn't receive enough love in my opinion, cause it is really good.
I just love you. I know that you want to make high quality content but I'd be happy to listen to you talking about something as trivial as cat food for hours and hours! Please make more videos - on whatever you want to. 😄
Watch Fleabag. Hazel, if you don't absolutely adore it I will look for pigs flying in the sky.
I love schitts creek it has this amazing dry humor and the acting is brilliant \nhouse of cards...i just love house of cards the filming is great\nThe fall... is a darker show but I enjoy the way they let the viewer kind of feel what the characters are feeling with out tell you straight out
I don't really watch TV or shows in general but I catch up on Family Guy, The Simpsons and Rick & Morty sometimes (I love cartoons aha)
rick and morty isn't on netflix in canada ?????????? but it is in other countries??????????????
Alas Rick and Morty is not on Canadian Netflix
hazel have you seen quantum leap? it's probably about 30ish years old, has about 6 seasons. it's sic-fi, but it's so freaking interesting and has this insanely great concept where this physicist develops a time machine and instead of jumping back to his present day, something mystical/divine takes control of the machine and uses it to right the wrongs in the past. the physicist along with his holographic pal, helps him figure out how to set things right.  i really think you should check it out. it's emotional, hilarious and really really ahead of it's time in terms of racism and feminism. PLEASE CHECK IT OUT
I literally love you so much I can't even x
RIVERDALE ISNT ON THIS LIST,\nbut Rick and Morty is so I can forgive you.
Brooklyn 99 is my show to binge but I don't have the restraint to save the episodes for a binge so I watch them as they come out and then go back and binge them all
Black mirror. \nBojack Horseman \nAnd I just started this one but it seems to be promising, Disjointed. (I mean how can you go wrong with Kathy Bates?)
bojaaaaaccccckkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
YES GLOW
#41mosttrendingvideo🎉🎉
People should binge  Youre the worst 
orphan black is amazinggg
watch peaky blinders its great
Orphan Black, Bojack Horseman
wubalubadubdub :=
sense8, rick and morty, orphan black and bojack horseman 👌👌
You look like Grace from Peaky Blinders!
Brooklyn Nine Nine & Bojack Horseman, two vastly different but hilarious shows.
THE GOOD PLACE
THE. OFFICE.
Bojack horseman, narcos, better call saul
Very autumnal 👌🏼
yall should watch brooklyn nine nine
The description you gave of Love, reminds me of You're The Worst. Two people who are very cynical towards life and love, meet and start falling for each other, but they both make it very difficult for themselves. The characters are also unlikeable. I have screamed at the screen while watching this lol, but it's very intriguing.
Gilmore girls! It has excellent filmography, extremely intelligent script writing, and a vast number of clever pop culture references
Bron / Broen aka The Bridge, the Swedish / Danish series.
Black Mirror. I'm sure you've seen at least a few episodes. Would love to get your take on it esp. considering the tones and plots of Septem and PrankMe
#RIP Tom
Another music legend has gone. RIP Tom Petty💔🎸
Rip Tom petty
When it was unconfirmed that Tom Petty died: Tom Petty has died. Will you stop saying that!?\n\nWell, unfortunate to have it finally confirmed... Rest easy, Tom. Running Down A Dream
Rest In Peace legend 😭😭
RIP Tom Petty. Nice clip. Way too soon and really unexpected.
RIP, Tom.
R.I.P
RIP Tom Petty.
RIP Tom :(
I loved Tom's cameo in this. R.I.P. you legend.
Rip
I'm surprised Tom wasn't on the show until 2002. I can imagine what the vintage goofy and fun Tom cameo might've been like if he was on in, say 1991.
I always thought that reading of Will you stop saying that?! was so hilarious. RIP
R.i.p. Tom Petty. We will never forget you.
Another legendary music giant....into the great white open.....let's get to the point and roll up a joint...Condolences to Tom Petty's family...to all of his many , many friends....and to his millions of fans world wide.....around the globe.....we will always have the music....running down the dream...cranking up the music as we rock the highways....Tom petty is putting the Wilburys back together again for one more show...
Rest in peace Tom petty you had a good life?
There goes the last human voice.
No the waiting is the hardest part of rock
Rest In Peace Thomas Early Petty.

RIP Tom Petty. Your legacy along with your meaningful and heartfelt music will live on.
This was my first introduction to the Late Tom Petty back in 2002, after that I became much interested in his work.
*sigh* There goes another one RIP
#RIPTOM We miss you already
RIP Tom Petty.
Rest In Weed Mr.Petty.

See that drunk girl speedin' down the street? \nShe's worried about the state of public schools. \nShe likes to party, she likes to rock! \nShe prays that our schools don't run out of chalk. \nXD
Hahaha!  Aww, love it! :)
Democrats are gonna lose big league in 2018 and 2020.
Great clip, I am sure liberals got allot of facts from it.
How about because people are afraid that their guns will be taken away so they buy alot before they can be taken away from gun stores.
what the hell even is this? lol, and people say the trending page isn't hand-picked by youtube staff. this is proof, because if it was based on shares like some people say it is, then who the hell would be sharing this
This is trending but idubbz isn't???
What the fuck is wrong with the YouTube trending algorithm?!
The first 10 seconds was my favorite part.
Wow so deep it's black. So profound it's silence.
Someone’s getting fired today.
Best news in whole fucking history
Since the makers of this video who paid YouTube to get on the trending page won't tell you, I will. Gun stocks rise because people are motivated to buy guns after a mass shooting. Part of what motivates them to do this is the desire to protect themselves from a perceived danger. The other part of this is that people know that politicians will use this even to try and restrict access to guns so it makes people think they'd better buy now before they lose the opportunity. Naturally, when sales go up, the companies do better. When the companies do better, their stock rises because more people see it as a good investment.
Interesting theory. Big if true
Love dumb idiots who dont get it lol. THERES NO GOOD REASON PEOPLE, jesus how can cnn fucking spell it out for you....
Unbiased news source, my ass. How about the fact that shootings remind people of the right to self preservation?
I've been waiting for something like this to happen
So Paul Monica at cnn is why gun stocks go up? Get your shit together! This is trending?
People boy guns too protect themselves in a similar situation is the answer
Cause it proves the effectiveness
*black screen*\n\n\n*not available in restricted mode*
I bought a machine gun over the counter for like $20 yesterday. Clerk was too busy to do the paperwork, and was like, meh, you're white, go ahead. Thank God for muh white privilege.
Why the fuck is this on trending?
Haha you stupid idiots. they don't even know what their talking about
What did I just watch for a good 10 seconds?
Fuck was this video for?
I'll answer the question.\n\nBecause asshats like CNN start beating the BAN ALL GUNS drum.\n\nSo me and everyone else starts buying more guns in case that becomes reality.
Thats that fake news shit right there
Probably the most useful video ever posted by CNN
Well...it’s not fake news at least
proof that the trending page is rigged
What the fuck is this and how is it #32 on trending? Never trusting trending page again.
Still doing your research off 4chan buzzfeed? Oh wait this is CNN
What's the difference between Wayne Robert LaPierre NRA & a drug kingpin?. ITS NOT PERSONAL , ITS JUST BUSINESS.
Gun control worked out great for the American Indians, don't you think? Just lay down your weapons and we'll take care of you! We are the federal government and we are here to help.
A more accurate title would be “a complete list of stories that cnn has not lied and or was extremely biased about”
Shit report this shit under missleading fuck this channel and video
10 seconds of silence, no video?  Some1 lose the DVD ?
CNN literally puts up a video of nothing and its trending... yea there is no bias on trending videos
The reason is that people want to protect themselves from attacks.
So this is on trending? Thanks  JEWTUBE
Thank you CNN for this insightful commentary on gun control. Obviously we should be spending 10 seconds of our life on fake news, instead of a video that you could've made titled Oh shit, Shooting occured, plz help those in need.\n\nI'm quite curious as to why your video editor didn't actually make a video, I literally could've made this video in 10 seconds exactly. In fact, these are the types of videos that make regular YouTube viewers think that YouTuber's jobs are easy, because let's be honest here - they think that our 20 minute videos only took 20 minutes to make. Instead, they usually take much longer. \n\nEither way, thanks for this beautiful like to dislike ratio. The fact t hat this is trending obviously means that you paid someone, hence your name - CNNMoney. Anyways, thanks for reading, catch you on the flipside, now I'm going back to watch Fox.
shocking and revealing content from the Clinton news network. Sure wonder why it is in trending and not IDubbbz new video. Susan you have some splaining.
Gotta trick the youtuber viewers an program CNN into there minds subliminaly to get people to watch them again RIGHT BABE?
Thank you so much cnn, for I have been enlightened
Ooooh! That’s why?! Cool. Very informative. \nTrump is not going to like what you showed at 0:04 and 0:06\n\n#CNNisTHEbest
Some cracked at CNN thought it was a good idea to upload this....
....Interesting.
So this is on trending... but the Content Cop on Rice Gum isn't?
This really change my point of view on guns
This was emotional. You could hear Paul R. La Monica's voice breaking as he explains this... R.I.P Vegas
Not even a link to an article or anything?
if this isn't evidence of favoritism in trending IDK what is.
What cnn couldn't come up with any bullshit lie for a change?\nBottom line is cnn is full of shit all the way from the owners to the talking heads to the viewers.
I feel like everyone who clicked this is now on a list.
FAKE NEWS!! THEYRE BETTER AT CLICKBAIT THEN JAKE PAUL AND LANCE STEWART
Well that was enlightening.
all cnns news should be like this
This is some next level classified information
Seems like another rock solid example of CNN journalism.
I love it! This is the best peaceful unbiased video ever in years! ....Well that Corrupt News Network has made anyways. Congratulations, maybe y'all are getting back on track to True News.  (Highly Unlikely)
CNN is  FAKE NEWS,  we need to STOP watching  this LIBERAL AGENDA ,BRAINWASHING  CRAP!!!👺👹👺👹👺👹👺👹👺
so YouTube just saw how glorious this video was and it's only number 30 on trending? should be first, trending is rigged
I'll be goddamned. So, George W. Bush DID do 9/11.
I had no idea!
CNN finally understood that's sometimes its better not to say anything than bullshiting
So this is trending but Asian Jake Paul is nowhere to be seen... cool.
Nice one... will someone please fire Susan?
Who the fuck liked this video!?
This is a top 30 anime betrayal.
suicide lockheed martin
Fake news
C'mon guys...
Wow, 10sec...😂
So FAKE
CNN wtf is this?
Once again, fake news..
Thank you.
Trash cnn with trash politics
10 seconds long and trending
😂 YouTube messed this one up for trending
Go home CNN you’re drunk 😵
Wow censorship much
More original content than pewdiepie

CNN HAS NOTHING TO SAY.
Bad day?

Really nigga? 10 seconds of nothing
Brilliant.
Worst 10 seconds ever.

Beautiful video.I love your songs \nGreetings from Poland :)
I have never been in a relationship before but this video somehow melted my heart.
Anyone realized that after party studios produced this? (Callux's company) pretty dope!
The only you song that I know and will recognize is by Captin Jack.
I love the vibe of Sarah songs😭💗 soooooooo goooood
Who would dislike this
I'M SO PROUD OF SARAH I LEGIT CRYING RN AAHHH
Maybe you will get some @ChillNation support for this one. Awesome Track! 😍
Sarah's voice is so relaxing and soothing
I love it! Now give me a slow one of just you and the piano. Gosh, I'd love that.
When I first saw her friends I thought that was jake paul Paul and Erika Costel
Wow video quality is great and the song is good 8.5/10 😂
Thought that was Pewdiepie in the thumnail
That's great , loved it !!!!!
Who wants Sarah to cover 1800 by logic?
Sounds like a Trap Nation song
absolutely amazing video, well done, you should be so proud!! Love it 💜
What’s callux’s opinion on your “boyfriend”
Wtf is Gareth Walker from Fifa 17-18 doing on here then
Sarah words can’t describe how good this is
I discovered you just a few days ago and girl I'm IN LOVE 😍 this is a fave song so far, been on repeat for past 4 days.
Still can’t take the song seriously when it’s Gareth Walker In the video ahaha
Looks like Sarah is team Walker.
Willne send me here but this is so good😍
im sorry for laughing but i cracked up at the first shot when she's in the bathtub and the angle is so funny 😂
NEED a behind the scenes! Loved this! X
Probably my favourite songs of hers or call me out xxx
Was the other people she went to the beach with her friends or was it suggesting they were all a bit more than friends?
wow this is an amazing video, loved it

Horrible. Unworthy. I dont feel nothing.
One of the funniest videos at BufferFest
Saw this at Buffer fest and absolutely loved it. Was by far my favorite!! Hope to collab with you two someday
its an upgraded karen from spongebob
Why did it remind me of the movie HER
I was laughing to myself so hard I think I lost a lung....
I liked the video but I then started thinking about my own relationship...
I can't with this... I just... I can't
...that's not the punchline I was expecting.
you guys never cease to make me laugh
I really want to dislike to break the 199
HE'S BEEN USING OTHER DEVICES\nJack:WHAAAAAAAAT
This made my day XD
😂😂😂😂This is way to funny
Now they've both fucked inanimate objects. Jack's fucked a balloon and Dean's fucked a computer.
I will admit the end kind of surprised me
This reminds me of closer
I just need disk space is honestly my favourite joke in this sketch.
She sure is the Apple of my i...Mac.
I love this so fucking much
This humour is just so smart, I love you guys!❤️
I  w a s n ' t  d r a w i n g  o n  c h e s t  h a i r
can we still resolve why Jack was drawing on chest hair with a permanent marker?
That's why i loved you guys for years now, you always have creative ideas that genuinely make me laugh :D
Lowkey wanna be that Computer at the end....
It all makes sense now, that's how people fuck their laptops
very Her. i liked it.
Loved this premiered at Buffer Festival and love it again!
i’m confused on what i should feel
Yes! What else would I be doing?\n--I laughed so hard my mom was concerned about me
What else would I be doing!!! than watching jack and dean videos all day
This was incredible! Also I'm always surprised by their accent lol why
The outro being parallel to the first shot was a nice touch. Lovely sketch!
Thank you for this 👌 content lmao
It took me so long to figure out it was Anna Akana's voice
Yo I'm new here, are they dating?
reminds me of spike jonze's Her
Should I be proud that jack & dean are on trending or concerned that 186K people watched a video about a man rubbing his dick against a computer??
this is the future millenials want
this is just the ultimate what the fuck video😂😂😂
Not the ending I was expecting.
Queue Bad Religion - I Love My Computer.
Welcome to the world of tomorrow. ..
I can't believe this is #18 on trending!
and they say the perfect video doesn’t exist
WT FUCK IS THE END NO THERE IS A LINE THAT YOU CROSSED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI might watch that again
What the actual fuck
If that last bit wouldn't be there then this video would have been amazing
Lol I don't know what I just watched, but my boyfriend said I can never pick videos again...he can't stop me xD
Holy shit this is great 😁😁😁
Am I the only one that felt genuinely akward during that exchange?
OMG 😱! Am I the only one who felt that response when the laptop said it's... Different, ahhh man, that's when hell would've broken loose for me!
The fact that Anna is in this video, even just as a voice, makes me hate it!
This is the best thing ever XD
It's .... different. *flashbacks to the ross and rachel break up scene*
I've never seen this video nor do i know about these guys, but from the thumbnail I could tell they were British. Great video 👍🏼
These guys deserve so many more subscribers!
_I don't use Apple. I prefer Pear._
so the cult of apple has become a sex cult got ya.
That ending haha.. I just thought. He would be putting a usb in and out really fast..not fucking his computer haha
Reminds me of an 07 - 08 YouTube. I have missed sketches like this. Nostalgic for me. glad I found this video
It would've been funnier if you guys kept the whole reference implied. Once you start saying things like polyamourus and dick... It breaks the joke quite a bit.
why is Dean getting prettier XD
This got very awkward very quickly
😆
Briljant :)
THIS IS SONE FUCKING WEIRD SHIT
i love this
Her (2013) dir. by Spike Jonze
Nice chest hair btw
that got weird fast
THIS IS BRILLIANT
This people
**Sponsored by Apple**
oh wow that ending XD
what
Holy shit Dean is-
Perfect!
Her
Her 2.0
I crie evrytiem
XD I can't breathe
Oh uhm, wow 😮
I heart Anna Akana
OMG! That is freaking hilarious!!
*conscience
Thats really funny
🤣
i need outtakes. give me outtakes.
Her (2014)
this makes me uncomfortable...
Nazi Bar was better
Fucking Gold!!!
33# trending nice!
Omg 😭😂😂😂
Well I'm dead plz send flowerz
hahahahahahahahahhahahahaa
???
Disgusting wmaf trash with Anna the white worshipper
thaz my two fav youtubers together. wtf
First Self Conscience vampire from CollegeHumour and now this lol. Keep it up J&S
Pathetic liberal alex....
But didn't he immediately go to Puerto Rico?
Was Alec Baldwin not some raging drug addict?  Did he not ring up one of his own children and THREATEN her?\n\nWhy would anybody think this guy is funny he is hardly the image of morality.
PROGS have the lowest sense of Humor....sooooo sad!!
this piece of shit promised to move out of the USA if Trump won, please keep your promises fake Trump !!!!!!!
Loved the sketch but poor Melissa does not work as that kind of straight man (no hate on her as a whole; love her in general). Also speaking as a Brit who doesn't know much about American politics I've really struggled trying to gage what kind of person Jeff Sessions could be based on his impersonation... Is he just a clingy creep?
Alec Baldwin is a walking piece of shit.
SNL is sooooo garbage and lame they try hard to be funny but they're not👎👎👎👎👎 MAD TV was the shit but wtf happen #ALLBAD
#258 episode of mediocre trump. Not funny after ep. 50
Just a no talent hack who has not done anything for this nation.
Okay this dumb jew Alec Baldwin is kind of funny but when will they make comedy on SNL that isn’t just libtard based hating on Trump it gets old.
f. trump, we don't need our jobs back, or law & order or those racists cops, we want to be cool, like in Clinton & Obama area , smoke what we want, have a generous welfare and screw those pensions in auto jobs, working 20 years to get them (really?)......  now we have 200$ a month HCare.....  life is good, no need to work 8-12 hours per day.... let those jobs stay in China and let the mexicans work for us here, we worked enough, hear us ? We worked enough, time for us to watch SNL & Hollywood soap opearas ...(sorry that hollywood happen to be mostly white folks b/c white folks pay for the movies with white actors and pretty blondes,,, f. racists but that's how this shit works).......  we need no IDs, no gender, no family, no heritage, no pride, no history, no accountability, no legal guns,.... just a monthly stipend man, large enough to keep us going...... what's the big deal you f. trump - lost jobs, Illegals, Muslims phobic ?  Let the jobs get lost, Illegals get in & muslims rule here too,... they all make wonderful democrats and it's good for all of us !!!\n\nyou racist who keep marring the most prettiest women while you  giving common ppl like us no chance ? f. man..... I wish Obama was still out president for the next 80 years.....  with all of those new arabs coming here, probably new oil would have been discovered here......and living on welfare in eternity ....
SNL isn't funny anymore., interesting perhaps, but not funny.
I could watch Alec Baldwin busting on Trump all damn day long.
15k down vote says it all belushi must be rolling in his grave, what a libtard shit show.....
Stopped watching this show when it went all left wing. I'm wondering if we will see a Harvey Weinstein skit next week. With him getting undressed and asking Ashley Judd for a massage. Ms. Judd screamed at the Washington Rally about Trump and just forgot to include Mr. Weinstein in her phony rant. Trump = Bad    Right = Wrong   White =  Oppression   White America = Conservative Religious Close Minded Gun Toting Rednecks.  I lost my sense of humor long ago. My Sicilian Grandfather used to say. There's alot of bull shit in America. TV Movies and most Main Stream Vomit that smells of a country losing it world standing.  Keep laughing folks the jokes on you. HA HA HA HA !!!!!!!
Jeff Sessions is a 80 year old new born baby
B-AN-AN-AN-AS lmao I'm dont know why people hate trump hes providing a great 4 years of comedy for the next 100 years
who thought this was funny?
as the one mayor said, since no one is going to help I'll have to do it myself. thats the pr way. in texas where get er done is a motto, they help themselves first before asking for help. lets see a skit that portrays the situation for what it is not from some Canadian who failed his run for mayor if nyc
This guy use to be a good actor...
Can we go back to a time when politics were boring? I am running out of Xanax bottles.
Somehow I doubt their ability to cast aspersions on the third world countries they (the complex) demonize and dominate. Somehow it seems less than truly heroic.
Alec Baldwins impersonation is so good i genuinley forgot i was watching an snl sketch for a minute.
Jeff Sessions Please don't Tweet on me...... happy Alec won Emmy, he deserved it!!!!
Folks listen to me because I'm no nonsense but I'm all nonsense.   That pretty much sums up Trumps presidency.
Trump is god
Funny
FEMA PRIME!!
LMAO.  Fabulous SNL!
I love america
At 0:02 mintster
Donald Trump needs to be in the NBA, he had a great shot throwing those toilet paper rolls in Puerto Rico 😂
Now wonder trump calls this stuff fake, he doesnt look near as orange enough to pass as a trump look a like
funny
Did anyone see the picture of Walt Disney behind Trump?
lolol FEMA Prime....love it\nI bet AMZN hasn't donated a single buck for those brown people down there
This same old shit for over a year \nSNL is whacked
Alec Ballsack and his dopey face have always rubbed me the wrong way.
*Every Racist Has A Black Friend*  The #1 Music Download of The Day \nShare and Order You're Right here    ( http://cdbaby.com/cd/stonethug52 )

This fat girl should start exercising and eating healthier...
Garbage SNL..gets there ratings by imitating your GREAT PREZ..TH A TS SAD...JOHN.GILDA.JANE.BILL.Hd MORE CLASS...MAKING $ OFF OUR PREZ...TOTAL CLASSLESS!
Oh well at least Baldwin finally has reliable work !!
God awful and I voted for Stein.
This comment section is cancer
alex balwin is an ashole  and a hipocrat...boycut NBC...
I mean it's just not funny anymore.
Make America Golf Again.\nCall him Rocketrump, please?\n\nWere the emoluments the balm before the storm?
This is disrespectful for the Puerto Ricans.
How is this shit still on air? Mad T.V. was so much better.... This is shit...
Vincente Fox photo in background is brilliant.
Donald trump he is the best
You know what I'm not a liberal or a conservative or left or right or any kind of wing, what I AM is an American and it is my God given right to believe that Trump is not fit to be the president of a high school student council let alone this country, and no amount of so called facts can make my opinion invalid or wrong, just as the ones who do like Trump have that same right, you can disagree with me all you want and vice versa but  I am so sick of this childish name calling shit that everyone is doing. As for this skit and show SNL has been making fun of presidents for over 40 years and if you like Trump fine but don't go crying about how this is something that's never happened before and Trump is being singled out and victimized  cuz he isn't. Go back and watch some of the W Bush skits and how they made fun of him for example, and all the other presidents, there was a time in this country when no matter what side of the political divide you were on we would all able to not take a comedy show so seriously and have a laugh together. Right now with all the hurricane damage and what happened in Vegas should be something that brings us all together as a country, but instead it's only made us more divided than ever.  My thoughts and prayers go out to all those affected.
Sessions has got to go!! That said, I thank Jesus every day that Hellary Rotten Clintoris isn’t POTUS
Good thing this is not on a school night
Wait? So this is funny in America? I didn’t laugh once. Libtard trash propoganda
Give this video a thumbs-Up if you like rockmusic please: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQsQl7AL5Rg
THAT FACES ARE REPUGNANT, BOTH OF THEM. THE OBESE JEW AND THE ORTHO FACE OF THE OTHER FUCKEN JEW !
What a disgusting bunch these SNL and Alec Baldwin in particular: sucking up to gangsters and terrorists.
Alabama here..I resent fake southern accents and I despise mean spirited people...on both sides. People are down right evil! People in large metropolitan areas have a distorted sense of life. I have been to large cities. They are loud and closed in and no land with green to own...unless your rich!
Spot on, LOL. The fact it bothers Trump so much makes it that much funnier.  Trump is a laughing stock and really should step down and admit he failed horribly. But his ego will not let him do this. Trump has lived in a fantasy world for so long where laws don't apply and he always gets his own way. Trump is putting his ego and stupidity before the people. That alone should be enough to get ride of the fucker and start over. Sad time in American history. Totally unwatchable as Trump would say.
here at puerto rico, just in the highway getting some of that crappy internet
Alec Baldwin is the only good thing to come out of the Trump presidency
I used to love waking up and having cereal for breakfast,\nnow every morning I'm gonna have that face in my head ( 4:47), and lose all appetite
You dumbasses really need to stop the BS, you suck. By the way Boycott SNL and all other idiotic comedians.
Awww, I was expecting more controversial issues.
Get rid of this clown. Snl is funny except for this scum bag who plays trump.
Sane and Smart people of America. Trump has infiltrated youtube. they keep messing with my posts and if u noticed they are starting to post only videos of how great trump is trying to brainwash us. Fuck you youtube and trump trying to control the media. I have already seen enough bullshit from trump. He is a sadistic son of a bitch and u can't brainwash me. Once again fuck you you tube !!!!
He punched a reporter and now does these skids..\n\nNo more movies 😆😆😆
I love Alec Baldwin I think he's an awesome actor.
Lmao.  At least the snowflakes will have SNL to dry their tears for the next 7 years.
This totally reminded me of Obama
_onald Trump .the D is missing because its in err hater mouth. Fuck you snl.fuck your mom hillary. Fuck you gay step mom obama .fuck mike obama . mutha fuck you terrorist bitches
Fema prime 😂😂😂

Freaking hilarious! oh yes
so apparently Trump loves mentally retarded people.
I voted Trump. Greatest American President this country ever had. God bless President Trump.  God Bless America.  SNL has not been funny in 20 years
Why so many Damn dislikes. People still like him? HOW! 😂 Or maybe there disliking him. That's probably it.
Rosie O’Donnell should be playing Sarah!  That would be the ultimate dig to the trumpster.
Abused your daughter lately? You are so , not funny! Better luck next time!
Piss off SNL.
America hasn't made any really good comedy for years. Now everything there is two hundred and ten percent political....\nI'll stick to my old shows.
UR......NOT.....FUNNY.....SNL
Same! I always have to roll up my pants otherwise i feel too hot and stuffy

The Dark but faded Sepia or whatever that lighting/color grading is, is fucking amazing.
Your style is amazing❤
i love the fact that connor invented the aesthetics and being aesthetic
You have a perfect style! I need more this videos, because is so cool!
All these looks look amazing on you, i wish i had the style you have ♡
Love your style , Love your voice , Love your chracter , Love your everything. Love you connor✨
someone help me find a boyfriend who's this fashionable
MY FAVORITE BOIIII ♡ (dont tell J***k*** that I said this) YOU ARE SO CUTE!
I have 1 pair of shoes and they are reebok white sneakers. I love them to death!
im in love with Connor! i want my guy friends to dress as well as he does.
I just felt like this was sponsored by rebok
DO MORE I LOVE THIS
Look number 3 is a pass. If I had to grade it on a scale of 1 being the lowest to 10 being the highest, I would give it a 3. Again not a fan of those shoes and that sweater is not really that cute. I think had you gone with a white tee shirt and another style reebok shoe I could have given you a higher score
That leather with the sweater 😍
I LOVE THIS. The whole vid is so well thought out and aesthetically pleasing!!
PAYAMANNNNNN
Since you are in London can you do like maybe a Halloween colab with dan and phil
0:45 the most aggressive ive seen connor be
I remember I was literally one of the first people to watch Connor now I never watch him lol.
Why are u so fucking cute?
His style is literally my inspiration
you're such a bean ily
if i was a man, this is what would inspire my life
When you live in Canada and would freeze your ankles if you rolled your jeans
Congrats buddy. You're still working hard to reach the top. However I'm still waiting for my signed book... It's been over 5 months since the UW meet and greet. Thanks dude. Cheers from Seattle
EDITING ON POINT\n\nUr killing it connor
How is your library soo color coordinated??? Im so jealous
I really do love you
LOOK AT YOU GO
Someone should make a meme of that clap and 'go me' I would use it all the time😂😍
I struggle so much trying to find a balance between streetwear and dress up, like I love being very put together but also comfy, something between Gabrielle Chanel and Kurt Cobain. Also minimalism and boldness. Alessandro Michele got me so good for this season and the next one. Ugh. Anthony Vaccarello and Lorenzo Serafini were SOOO good. Ugh.
You look sassy sweetheart. Love ya and love your style. I love autumn. It brings out a great feeling of love and romance. It changes me more inside than any other season. And love buying new clothes. Take care.
Damn, the colour grading on this video is beaut😍
*he got them g o o d a n k l e z* ❤
I love your work
the cutest thing i've ever seen
you're so precious and cute i love you so much and i love your clothing style ahshhshsb
Whyyyyy Common Culture is not available in Russia😩
Connor have you seen the trailer for the movie Call Me By Your Name, or read the book? I'm absolutely in love with it!
I want that orange sweater really badly
that yellow sweater is $775 um what
YOUR YELLOW SWEATER IS $775 WHAT THE FUCK HONEY
I don't want to those kind of video from you about fashion to end . 💕
Last look went from daddy to smol bean when u took the leather jacket off
I JUST BOUGHT A PAIR OF REEBOK CLASSICS LAST WEEK I FEEL SO COOL YAY

No one gives two shits
False flag operation
Smells like a false flag.
Fake fake fake, false flag you guys need to do a better job!!
America should ban gun's
This is a non-stop civil war in the United States of Morons (Tillerson said something on morons)
it's amazing: in this day and age there´s never a clear picture or film of anything; don´t know why people buy so expensive stuff.
Why is this guy not being called a terrorist  now?
United States of Idiots! How's that second amendment bullshit working out for you?
State-sponsored terror to get the guns
A bunch of racist country people that hate hispnaics browns muslims etc
My prayers go out to Vegas
If you wanna become a american citizen, you will be ready to get shot. I'm lucky because i'm not one.
I saw the broken window
I feel sorry for these people...but this is one attack . People more than that are killed daily in burma and kashmir....why there is so much difference...a man killed in usa and killed in kasmhir are equal...so why whole world is not doing something for kashmiries and burmese people....
The creators are beginning to demo again and they want us to know but the man is distracting us
See there's a lot of arguments about gun control etc. But I just look at the facts, why is it every other modern civilized society does not have these problems like the US does? We have mass shootings yearly now. Do not tell me more guns will solve everything because in this country getting a gun is easy and so far, that hasn't done a thing.
You will not believe this child's wish before he  is executed to  death…:\nhttp://cut-urls.io/RT51F55
This is America, people ask for so much freedom, free This free That, and the government even worry about another country never have enough human right, American now have so much human right, the right to Kill the right to express yourself, this is the true freedom of America, where average citizen has no right to enjoy their life.
Why is it okay for a civilian to have an automatic gun??
What's sad is that people are saying the Attack didn't happen and it's a hoax by the Government.
Shooter was a left winger antifa fuck going after conservative whites
My heart goes out to all that at are dead/injured stay safe and fuck these people that do this #prayforvegas
A bump stock is not necessary to make a semi-automatic AR-15 or AK-47 fire as a full automatic.  By pushing forward on the handguard while holding the rifle loosely and keeping your finger on the trigger without using the grip when the rifle recoils while being pushed forward it will bump the trigger finger repeatedly and keep firing. It mimics a bump stock.  It's a waist of ammunition that has no sporting purpose.
God bless this world this man is disgusting I know many people who were there I know few that died and I am heartbroken someone would do this it's disgusting #weareallone
Two days ago I posted cruel and disparaging comments ( that I've since deleted)  about this incident that I now regret.. what swayed my change of heart..    is that today,  i saw a collage of all the victims murdered by this maniac...all the young people who lost their lives.... at least 30 of the  victims were in their 20s ...absolutely heartbreaking... this shit most certainly was not funny.. and God help me ...I never should have made lite of it ....  I am so so sorry ... now what I would like to say  instead of the crew evil shit  I said previously.....is  that my heart goes out to all the families who lost someone in this tragedy and \n I don't care what race they  are/were...\n this was some fucked up shit..and  the  differences that we all have with each other are  irrelevant right now... As  for me this puts everything in perspective. ....Black versus white... Republican vs Democrat... kneelers versus non kneelers \n.its all bullshit....lives were lost ..innocent young promising lives.... who gives uh fuck who the President is... \n  If he or she can't even keep us safe in our own country whats the point and no I'm not blaming Donald' Trump or anyone for this.... nobody could have prevented this, just like those hurricanes.... now I'm not going to be phony and say we should all love one another... because despite this \ntragedy.  that's probably not going to happen... but what I will say to everybody is please be safe.... no matter what... we're all Americans.. and I for one don't want to see anybody hurt, and I definitely don't want to see anybody die.... God bless \n Love America... and all its citizens
There are now 59 confirmed dead, over 500 wounded, many are in critical condition.
People ask your self this question. Why would a man of this statue do something like this? Doesn't make any sense !!! Just like his brother is mystified just like I am
No one screams from being hit? No blood? No pictures or videos of people shot? 22k people w/cell phones?
Is beautifull, so many Rich and happy fmilly Ruin their live.
I feel so bad for why don't we they were on lockdown😭
I mean, I know country music is bad. But there's no need for this kind of behaviour.
but the mexicans are criminals? hahaha so whats that republicans?
Can Trump just not let Americans in America? They're far too dangerous.
I hope the shooter is injured and disabled in prison and dies of a brain aneurism when he is let out so he finally sees the light of freedom once again only to have it ripped away
White on White crime is insane in the USA. White terrorism. God bless the victims.
ay yall i was working on the strip right across the street during this shit was WILD
 At lest two have been killed...
Those poor ,terrified people I feel so sorry for them R.I.P those who deid at this attack R.I.P you shall be missed
Can someone please explain why there is absolutely no blood or dead bodies in any YouTube video I've seen??????? I've seen people running and screaming.  I've seen people being carried by others,  but not a single sign of blood or anything. This is one strange mass shooting.
Fake news
shooter was with  Radical Antifa Group, look it up , dont believe anything on the bbc
VERY GOOD NEWS..!! THIS IS A PAYBACK TIME FOR BRAINLESS AMERICANS , REVENGE FOR KILLING INNOCENT CIVILIANS IN SYRIA, UKRAINA, YUOGOSLAVIA, LIBYA, AFGHANISTAN, IRAQ, ETC.... GOOD AMERICAN IS A DEAD ONE...!!! WELL DONE..!!
Guy is just walking like,  why is everyone running and falling to the ground? 
Yet another inside job, lol that’s even faker than 9/11
Of course the propaganda arm of the continent colonizing British government would happily promote this to their disarmed citizens with no ulterior motives.
Where is that photo on thumbnail? Clickbait sht
It like we not safe going no where
WHERE WAS SUPERMAN?  PROBABLY CLARK KENT WAS BANGING LOUIS WHEN THIS WAS GOING ON.
NRA supporters gunned down by an NRA supporter.  The irony.
Excuse me USA, here's Italy. It's very simple, let me explain this in the easiest way possible: no guns, no shootings. Why are you trying to avoid mass shooting with more guns? Think about it in this way: how do you put a fire out? Certainly not with more fire. Think about it USA. Let me know if you need another explanation. I'll gladly help :)
The worst country in world
If he christian, he would be called atheism and politics aim. \nIf he muslim, he would be called terrorist. \nUSA logic!
CIA false flag to take away guns ........ oh and go to hell trolls.
Since he was white everything is fishy and conspiracy but if a person of color he is a terrorist good job America
Here's a tip, Stop going to events.
You guys will blame Muslims for it soon .
People mowed down by a leftist while chanting “god bless America”. Seems like liberals got an early Christmas present.
Who takes the professional pictures of these people and why?
I'm betting right now that there will be a movie made about this, and it will star Mark Wahlberg
There no gun fire in China. only use knife to kill . more bloody…  Sorry about las Vegas . Horrible
I was at las vegas 3 weeks ago.
a Casino.. of Gambeling.. in USA 20 Trillion Dollar Debt.. bothersome
Politics is social. Change has to be individual. Politics don't really exist except that fools buy into it. Like putting a game in front of people you know will fight over it. \n\nGreetings everyone! I'm trying to start a music video channel here on YouTube but it's difficult to get seen. \n\nThe music is instrumental and may fall under categories ranging from mellow to rock to hip hop - but mostly a unique combination of them all. The videos are original and usually random - whatever comes to mind in the moment. \n\nI'm new to both video and music production so I will gladly acknowledge input from anybody willing to offer it. If you have the time, click my icon and let me know what you think. Thank you in advance, it's much appreciated!
58 dead, 500 injured. 128 shot.
Ban concerts!!!
Neighbor of 8 months said Paddock was a Trump supporter but also believes it's a setup since Paddock was a really nice guy and couldn't believe he'd turn out to be a monster.
That's a meme just need the school shooting theme and we good.
Congress responsible for these murders allowing guns to public.
They don't call Los Vegas Sin City for nothing..
GTA real life
https://youtu.be/5nhZRmqwT_A TRUTH BEHIND VEGAS SHOOTING PLEASE SHARE
#prayforvegas
Man Delay Bay.. Los Vehazzz
Wherever there is ISIS iran is iran, Wherever iran is
*STOP THE PSYOPS*
What happens in vegas stays in vegas
Sub to willne
*Prayers arent needed...MONEY IS!*
country music
#rip for Vegas ppl
omg
Praying for you
What about porter ico??
I hear firecrackers
No way to prevent this says only nation where this regularly happens
USA is such a evil country.....full of evil people.
Alrighty, let's take a vote for something that's absolutely not debatable the will hopefully get both sides of people to agree. CRACK DOWN ON GUN SMUGGLING. The only true unbiased way to see if shooters will get their guns legally is to crack down on all illegal transactions taking place in drug dens. Making legal guns harder to get is one thing, but I think ALL OF US should be able to agree to CRACKING DOWN ON ILLEGAL WEAPONRY.
Dumb country hicks getting killed. Good haha.
Welcome to America. Guess what nothing will be done. We all going to feel sorry, pray, help but our Congress will not stop gun control. What type of amendment is for  an individual  to have a semi auto machine gun for  protection?  20 mass shooting in 2/3 years alone. NRA profit on guns is more valuable than human life's right?  Smh, Welcome to America.
This is very heart breaking for family members to witness the death of their own. When I heard that he was going to kill people during life was beautiful, I was completely shocked because one of my own was going over there. However, we have to see the bright side of things. These things happen every day, and that is how life is now. We have to take advantage of this. This is a learning experience. Stop saying things and start doing things. Also, I don't believe Isis did this. They claim every attack and it is quite annoying for Muslims because they are always the ones to be blamed and I think that we should be sorry.
Nobody thinks this is suspicious or a little odd doesn't add up
JUST MORE FAKE NEWS..\nNobody died,stop with your Soros funded Vigil's and paid crisis actors!
More like 59 dead, and 515+ injured...
Random 64 year old white guy with no criminal background, no history of mental illness and was a friendly man got a hold of 23 rifles and randomly shot into a crowd of people. Seems very fishy, Remember not to take whatever you see on the news as the narrative, think for yourself.
HOLY SHIT, yall Americans need to be friends with russia atm yall mfs need help yall gon die without help with that shit Yall need to evacuate rn! \n\n(Edit) that wasn’t a racial comment all my peoples is my peoples love you guys but seriously yall need to do something about that
Why does this always happen on my birthday
Watch & wait! The girlfriend in the Philippines has more than a little involvement in this!
white terrorism!!!!!
No noticing that witnesses reported multiple shooters?....
Nick! You didn’t cut open the cupcake ☹️
You didn't cut it open!
I wish we could call this real astronaut food 👩‍🚀
No cut scene?
Nick you didn't give us the cutting shot!
Activated charcoal could be dangerous for people who take medication as it rids the body of unwanted substances. Other than that your cupcake is AMAZING!!
We need a huge cake version of this!!
**eats the screen**
Nick can you pretty please create a TIM TAM Cupcake ?? \nThumbs up peeps if you want one too so nick here can get alerts hehehe ♥️
Where do you get your food safe Charcoal, Amazon?? Ive never used it before, does it have a taste or change the flavor?
Was wondering if the charcoal changes the flavor?????
I love how he says hoi goys😂❤
I just found this channel and I'm So Glad I did! LOVE the videos and cupcakes!♥️
Great video Nick! How about making a banoffee cupcake or banoffee macarons?😍
Hi Nick! Have been following you for quite a while now and I just wanted to let you know that your cupcakes creation are AMAZING!! Love it so so much :D
Make this into a cake!!
Can you do a tiered vanilla bean cake with vanilla bean fondant🙏🙏🙏 I kinda really love vanilla 🤤
Why didn’t you cut it!? 😩😂
Ive got to say this is my fave cupcake yet.
Amazing content
I want Miranda sings inspired cupcake so baddddddddd
Never thought of edible charcoal powder before! Always struggle so much trying to get black icing haha! Thank you! 😘
I like to use half plain flour and cake flour will this make a difference if I do this as well following your recipe measurements
Hi Nick! \nReally love your channel and look forward to your new videos every week :D\nYou totally inspire me ;)\nPlease can you create a Scran Line version of gingerbread man cookies or cupcakes for fall :D\nLots of Love from South Africa <3 <3 <3

Real talk, do galaxies even have a midnight? I’d guess no.
This would be great as a cake
Oh sweet Jesus I just jizzed in my pants. These look ahhhhmazing!
Does it taste different with the charcoal?
omg adore the colours in this one... I am a huge galaxy colour/design fan... might be making something like this for my upcoming sister in laws baby shower now... but suprise inside instead of galaxy sprinkle, like a little fake baby
if you arent making abit of a mess are you even doing it right
How long does it take you to go through a bottle of vanilla extract?
when he said space cowboy, did anyone else think of Cowboy Bebop?
Why is everything you make so gorgeous, whenever I go to your channel it inspires me to create! You are best cinnamon bun😋
I can only imagine what your mouth looks like after you eat them.
I have a question about the brand of lustre dust you use.\n\nI find the ones you get straight from the super market very gritty and doesn't produce the shimmer that you have with the one you use. I've gone to a couple of kitchenware shops that sell some decorating stuff like food colours and sprinkles but they are the same ones I find in the supermarket. your lustre dust also seems to form a really opaque solution when you mix it with the vodka and doesn't clump up so I've been look but can't find any that doesn't clump! :(
How does he make this look so easy >.<
i swear your cupcakes are always the best!!
You didn't cut it in half 😩
He didn't cut it in half and that stresses me out.
This video is so different!!!
The background music reminds me of the Sims music 😂 and a little bit of Animal crossing in it hahah
My favorite part is when he scraps down the bowl. So clean. So swift
Thats like the most beautiful cupcake ever!
Why isn't this on trending
Aww. You didn't say, Let's get stuck into the recipe. 😞
Now see this is a pretty cupcake. Dark yet sweet like my soul lol
If only I had a cupcake to eat like that one right now very yummy as always Ñick 😊

You deserve so many more subscribers!😭❤️
Nick! How do u not have at least 1 million subs?!
I need a cutting scene 😭😭😭 This is so gorgeous! 🌌
I made it 999 likes who will get it to 1,000???
Hey Nick, I really appreciate your effort into making beautiful cupcakes and macarons, but can you please do more cake videos too? I love your decorating techniques, I would love to see. Them even on cakes. Love you loads!❤️
You should make a galaxy cake
Does the charcoal have a funny taste? Food coloring always adds a metallic flavor....
This is such a gorgeous cupcakes. I'm in love with this beauty
The cupcake is so gorgeous, I wonder if I can make similar cake like that
Hey nick! 😁 what kind of camera do you use?
I could've sworn I've seen this before... Am I crazy? Maybe you just did something really similar... Amazing look regardless.
So elegant, and boysenberry sounds delicious!
gorgeous ！！！
I love the charcoal idea, but does it leaves an after taste like food coloring does?
Me encanto este video y el cupcake
I love this one sooooo much💞
Nice art work.
...I... I don't know what boysenberries are...
He should open up a bakery 😊 like if u agree
You didn't cut it xC
I wouldn't eat this much food coloring, but I love watching colorful food videos.
Wow,Love,love, lovvvveeee. Not sure my taste buds could take the explosion of all the icing though....my girls though😆

No slice? Nooooo 😢
Was that boison berry or poison berry escence????? \nBtw I love all your cakes there so gorgeous

@Binging with Babish My brother, Michael Chapa, has been a fan of yours for a long time. In fact he is also the one who introduced me to your channel. I would like to buy him a signed book.... is there any way I can get this? Please and thanks!\n\nAlso can people thumb up so he might see this comment?
Wow damn dude this is a great idea/book. \nLove the cover art!!!!

Just bought your book. \nIt's out of stock.  Do you know when I'll be getting it?
wait, does it mean anyone who pre-order the book can have the signature or have the chance to win the signature?
He's out of stock!!! Nooooooo
tbh for the pre orders u should stick the books in the envelopes and the signed one mix them up and lable them so you send them out with no clue to who the winner is XD
When to get book realized it was already out of stock

I need to interview this man and ask him what makes him get such brilliant writing.\n\nAndrew, your passion for alliteration is often keeping me coming back to this fabulous channel.\n\nThat, and the food.\n\nI Youtube for a really niche group, Trading Card Games, and even then, I wish to emulate and learn from you as a content creator.\n\n\nYou got the stuff. Idunno what it is. but you got it.\n\nThat being said, Hope your book sells and goes Triple Truffle or whatever cooking books do when they sell out in the millions.\n\nI know what I'm begging friends to get me for Christmas...
Props man! Love your channel!

Super excited to pick this up when it comes in! Does anyone now if there is an online merch store?
Congrats
I bought your book last month for my b-day. (it was even on sale for $15) ^^ Looking forward to it!
You should try and make Monster Cake from Breath of the Wild! I'd love to see how you'd go about making your own 'Monster Extract' for the recipe!\n\nEdit: Seems you've already done this! Good show!
Pre-ordered
My dude is trending :D
Do you ship to New Zealand and do I still get a personalised copy if I don’t pre-order?
He inspire me to be a better cook, but I'm too lazy to upload any content..
I'm 100% buying this. \nThinking of making it my mom's christmas present!
This will be an amazing gift for Xmas. My girlfriend will have no idea. She loves your stuff!
You should do JT barbecue sauce from planet terror
Pre-ordered right when you first announced it!! I'm so F-word (yes that one XD) ready!!!
Sadly can't pre-order ,amazon hates me for so reason and aren't no barnes and noble here , but sure as  shiz I'm getting this book \n\nYou should make calzone from parks and recreation  and make it with low fat ingredients ( be a nice homage  to Ben Wyatt with The Low cal calzone zone)
I have to wait till Wednesday to get this.\nI swear to God, if this sells out in one day...

Will there be a audio book version so I can hear your smooth voice while trying out the recipes?
the only YouTuber book I can get behind
copy paste comment
i want the book but i dont have amazon in my country
Yeah, my pre order got delayed too...ordered it back in aug...sux...but I still want so I wait
Got an email from Amazon today saying that my pre-order has been delayed. No shipping date currently available. :(
Amazon told me it was delayed... I pre-ordered this like a week after he first announced it. Why has it been delayed if it hit bookshelves?
Any word on what's going on with the Amazon delay?  Preordered the day it went live, and Amazon has NO idea when it's gonna ship.
Soooooooo got an email today saying that the delivery of the cookbook had to be pushed?  Is there any say when they new delivery date will be? Just wondering.  Looking forward to receiving my copy!!!!!! 🙌🏽🙌🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽
Really disappointed that I pre-ordered months ago and am now being told I won't even get it until November if not later. Rather poorly handled book launch.
Amazon is now saying my preorder from August won’t ship until November 😭😭 This was supposed to be my birthday present to myself!
It's funny because it looks like a film reel but in the top right corner it looks like a pizza slice hahahahahahahahahahahahaha!
I ordered it back in August but Amazon seems to have failed me on delivering it in time. RIP
#11 ON TRENDING WOOOOHOOOO
I watched you when you had barely any views on videos...and now you have an amazing cookbook coming out 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 great work man, keep it up!!
Go to google and type: WUMO SEO. Its the most excellent Search engine optimization company in the world. If they can not rank your websites, they will offer you100% money back guarantee. They're the incredibly best.
I have the best cook book ever. It's called the internet. I can learn to make anything. So I will save my money and instead of buying some dumb cookbook I'm gonna buy some groceries.
Can't wait to torrent this.
I'm pretty disappointed, dude, I know this is popular but I pre-ordered this through your Amazon link on August 24th in Canada. Today I'm informed they are out of stock and it'll be delayed. It's a surprise gift for my girlfriend who introduced me to your wonderful channel. It's not your fault, I know, but pretty frustrated at a system that sells you a pre-order and they don't tell you it's not available until the night of expected delivery.
I swear I'm not green-screened onto this: it's just weird lighting!
I'm guessing Fermat's Last Theorem is one such case.
The ferries are direction controlled water kites. Are there any tethered kites or blimps used for moving people or stuff through areas of consistent air currents using the same principle?
I do love elegant systems like this. Nothing much can really go wrong and there is no reason this couldn't last forever. Another great system using water is the Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway. A funicular that uses water tanks to make the car heading downhill heavier to pull the lower one up.
I just found this with AVE's last video on reducing chatter on a lathe, so obvious, but I'd never looked at the problem in that way before.
Alright... NOW I'm interested why you were in my city. Did I miss an important exhibition or what?\nCan't imagine you just strolled along to talk about the four ferries we have and how they operate.
Escalators. Unlike Elevators (Lifts, for you Brits), Escalators don't/can't have counter weights. But why couldn't Escalators have generators or massive flywheels to generate or store energy of the ones carrying people downward?  That could then be used to help drive the ones carrying people up.
Wow tom is on trending, I'm shocked
You‘ve been to my town and haven‘t told me? To shame!
This technique is used in kayaking - it's called the 'ferry glide'.
Isn't this the same principle that yachts use to sail against the wind (tacking)?
Dude, bummer! Would've been great to meet you, since I live there.
Thank you for all the videos. Very much enjoyed and appreciated.
Oh I think there's plenty of room left in all of time to make a few more interesting ideas come to life....
COME TO LAUSANNE BABY WE HAVE SCIENCEY STUFF
You should do a video on the Theory of Inventive problem solving. A Russian engineer spent his entire life studying patents to see how humans made solutions to stuff like this. It's now generalized into a few charts, and is really quite handy.
Thats incredible! How has someone not applied this concept for electricity generation I wonder?
Ah, thank you for this Tom. =)
Interestingly a very similar technique in kayaking and canoeing is called ferry gliding.  Forward paddling and or momentum are substituted for the wire
I hope they got a license from the Fine Bros.
Wtf...I was just on one of these a few hours ago. Now I'm seeing this vid. What a coincidence
Since you are in Switzerland are you going to visit CERN? It's only 2 hours by car from there :)
We used to have hundreds of these in British Columbia. I assume they probably died out here because of safety concerns. We used to have car-sized wooden suspension bridges too.
Tom, I swear to God, this is the second time you were in Switzerland and I missed you again (last one in Zurich) by probably about a week or so! Next time you post something hinting there on Twitter or elsewhere, I will move heaven and earth and whatever else to meet you. Or at least try to give you a video idea via mail and getting you where I am so I can contribute.
Wow. That is so cool. I would never have had that idea. But so obvious when you see it.
There are several reaction ferries in Canada that carry cars.
IT'S CALLED PETROL TOM >:( but these boats are rather cool
Using warmth 20 meters underground via some conducting material to prevent train switches or other critical infrastructure from freezing over. \n\nSo obvious, but I dont think its done anywhere.
That's like the guy who floats down the river to work instead of driving 😊 I love simple solutions that use natural reusable energy
Sadly, thinking about is not enough, sharing the knowledge and people with a need that search for a solution is a must\nI think this relationship is what really changed the world, but today, with the tsunami of data on the internet, very few actually study something, and the rest have all the incentive to keep secrets and patent them since their livelihood usually depends on it\nso, cutting edge knowledge is a commodity and old knowledge is buried amongst irrelevant and sometimes wrong info and as a result get overlooked
When I was at Switzerland, I was stoned by clarity of Rhine in Bern... That river is something that I can not easily understand...
It's like a kite using water instead of wind.
I there some sort of meet up? I live in Basel!
I actually live just next to such a ferry. The one I can see from my window is much bigger and can load 10 cars or so. It is really fascinating, but I just don't like it for commuting because here the ferry has no scheldue, and waiting about half an hour can be quite annoying. Glad I only enjoy it on Sunday trips or so. Great video.
i didn't understand the principle  could somebody please explain it?
There are a few of those in the Netherlands as well, I believe, although they look like normal ferries and the cables run underwater, not above it. If memory serves me. And maybe they've been disposed of already.
Omg i was on the exact spot you stood there in Basel a few weeks ago!
I am sure there is one at Symonds Yat
We have a reaction car ferry in McLure, British Columbia, that will take a few cars at a time across the North Thompson.  It can't run when there's ice on the river or during spring flooding.
ah I'm so sad. I live in Basel but I'm on vacation right. so sad to miss you :(
That is a interesting thing to think about. \nIf you live in a place where the conditions for something like this doesn't exist, you'd never think about it. You'd never think to even look it up. \nA thing you don't know you don't know.
Read about another Swiss project recently. There's a mine in the mountains, and the ore (or whatever it produces) is transported down to the valley in trucks that use the weight to produce electricity on the way down, which is more than enough to drive them up the mountain again when they're empty.
How do you get 50 fps video?
I was so shocked when I saw your video because I am from Basel
Clever Bavarians recently replaced one of theese by a gasolin driven one. The old one has sunken due to the lag of maintanence...
It kinda works like sailing, but the wind is replaced with water flow and the resistance from the water is replaced with a cable.
Theres one of these on the River Severn at Hampton Loade, near Bridgnorth, but it hasn't run at all this year.
The obvious thing we still haven't invented is slood. It comes after fire, but before the wheel. Except we missed it.
If you kayak this is the same principle as in ferry gliding.
So how, exactly, is this different from sailing ships tacking? Still a clever idea, but I bet that if tom had experience on a sailboat this wouldn't be that innovative of an idea. Just an example of specialized knowledge.
A movie I saw as a child in the 1950's showed a scene with one of these craft being used in Florida at a time before railways, automobiles and air conditioning had made it hospitable for people from cooler climates to want to go there despite alligators and hurricanes.
Female phychology. There must be something obvious to it since it affects more than half the world population but we still haven't figured it out.
As a kayaker we do this all the time, it's even called Ferrygliding. The only difference with a kayak is that you have to keep paddling upstream.
Wow im amazed how fast flowing the rhine is compared to something like the Thames
It's an obvious idea to someone who sails sailing boats, basically it's just using the water currents rather than air currents to sail by ;)
I loved how, in addition to the usually informative video this one was also inspirational. Great job Tom. Thank you.
The 26 dislikes are from people who hate free energy. Shell I suggest any names?
Switzerland has the stupidest flag ever.
The closest thing i can think of to the big thing everyone has missed is solar power, although the caveat to that is people have definitely already thought of that for a very long time and also the only reason it isn't used worldwide is largely the greed of oil companies\n\nits REALLY obvious that the sun, the thing that makes life on earth a thing, and a practically infinite source of energy that is constantly beaming down on the planet, would be the best source of power but people still think its impractical
Until recently, there was a reaction ferry on the Severn at Hampton Loade - however, flooding in recent years has caused it to temporarily close on several occasions, and it I now appears to be permanently closed. Still, it was Notable enough to warrant a Wiki entry...\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_Loade_Ferry?wprov=sfla1
Its just a kite
...and Nile boats use a combination of wind and water flow to go upriver and down...\n...and-yes my fifth-grade observation about electromagnetism overrides Maxwell's...
I live in switzerland! And it works nicely!
Someone tell me why Thoughty2 has more than double the subscribers to Tom Scott?
better than tesla's auto drive
It's basically a kite. A water-kite, but the principle remains.
I'm going to London this Monday. Is there a chance I will see Tom?
They are *floating kites* for transporting people....
Just out of interest cause I'm living there, when where you in Basel?
all of Tom's videos are nicely done but, it's just me that his voice bother so much? =( it's not my fault tho.. sorry..
What a great solution!
They have one of those in Kurort Rathen,  Saxony. It's near Dresden of you're ever in the area
It's also a technique used in kayaks and canoes to ferry across rivers and other streams. Paddle against the current and angle your vessel towards the side you want to go to. It is great fun. :)
If we can sell pizzas with tomato sauce spread over them then why not toast with butter already spread?
There is one near Mammoth Cave in Kentucky.
How do other tall boats not hit the overhead cable?  Also, I'm reading that there are floating cable reaction ferries.  Even more of an issue for boats going up or down the river.
Have you thought of doing a video about that slice of  Germany inside Switzerland?
You also need a river that you can string a wire a cross that isn't going to be snagged by tall ships. Probably wouldn't work on the Thames.
aaaaaaajjjjjjj
Hamburger Earmuffs!
1:34 Uncesored Child's Face!
If you watch the white water canoeing in the olympics. You will see the competetors moving sideways in the water. This technique is called ferry gliding
This has the same premise as Harry turtledove's short story the road less taken
0:55 Now I know that unpowered wooden boats have higher precedence that powered-boats. I would also expect sailing boats would have to avoid as well. I then had to re watch the video because I got distracted 
Erection flurries
damn, this got deep
Donald Rumsfeld was right!  😂\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w5JqQLqqTc
Very prophetic Tom
That was delightful.
im sorry this is force vectors gitgud
Same as windsurf works
Excellent video Tom.
Ayyyyy I live in basel
Ohhh hey come to Geneva
Like
Awsome
Yay! Welcome to Basel
In Germany reaction ferries are called Gierseilfähren. I learned that from Die Sendung mit der Maus, an educational TV series for children.
Can you explain how cell phones and cell towers communicate at high speeds? Like on the motorway? (Does some of the signal get lost behind?)
Pretty sure humans have been pulling themselves across rivers using rope or wire one way or another for a few thousand years...
all her videos are so aesthetically pleasing omg. they make you feel so cozy haha.
The biggest mystery of the year, was it an owl or a pigeon ? 😂❤️

Early!
I ly Zoe 💓💓💓💓
I love how cozy your vidoes have been recently.
Thank you for the honesty Amelia ! I also wanted to share that as soon as you said that you come from everywhere I knew you had to Middle Eastern. I feel like middle easterns have been so shamed over the past decade that they ended up believing (myself included) that they should be ashamed of where they come from and that being Middle Eastern makes you less valuable to others. It is so sad. I am both lebanese and canadian. When friends used to ask me where i reaaaally come from, I used to be so ashamed and I used to make up pretty stupid lies to say that I was italian. Looking back at it now, I am so proud to be lebanese. I am also proud to be canadian. And whoever treats me differently after knowing where I reaaally come from is the problem. They're what's wrong, not me. LOVE LOVE :)
Shout out to your family and friends taking pics: they do a great job! Thank you for sharing their work!
I really love how nice and relaxed you look in this video!!
Can you address the stuff I read on the internet a few weeks/months back that says your instagram shots are photo shopped and you did not actually travel to those places???
Thanks for sharing with us so much of your personal details!
It was time to do a frank video!!!do also more!
Please do a jewellery collection! :))
best/fave instagram filters?

I love this video ❤️😍😍😍😍
I loved this cozy and chatty video! Thank you! Would you like to do a video about tips to dress as a short person? Like what type of chlothes suit you best if you have a small figure? Best, Diana
You look so pretty with natural make up!
Lovely video Amelia, your family sounds wonderful! xx
Your mum and friends make amazing pictures. Job well done. I am a huge advocate for if you can do it yourself you do it yourself. It saves so much money as well and the results are amazing. Xx
I have one question, I just wonder if you and Tijan are still friends. I don’t mean to be too intrusive I’m just curious cause you seemed to be old friends. \n\nKisses from Dominican Republic!
You look so fresh and glowing without the winged liner 😍
Yes Amelia, I loved this video from you! i'm so glad i got to hear you just candidly chatting about yourself :) i'm dying for a persian dinner cooking video! :) xxx

Loved the vid! And the relaxed vibes / look on you is so gorgeous and glowing!
I love your minimal make up in this video! You look beautiful! If you do a part 2 can you talk about what your parents do for a living and what your childhood was like in London?
I haven't watched a video of yours in a while, they haven't caught my eye, but this one was great! It flew by and I found everything you said really interesting.
Love this casual and chatty video!!
Love this video, you are so great!!!

You're so sweet 😽
Love your Q and A's! <3
Loved this so incredibely much!! Great one Amelia☺️Appreciate that you are keepin it real with us ❤️🙈
I always thought you were Persian and perhaps Albanian. Nonetheless, you're one beautiful mixed race woman!
Now do answers you have never questioned
I really enjoyed this laidback video :) Especially you answering the “work” questions:) Now my question may seem weird, but I’ve been reading so much about this so I’m curious about your thoughts: Why don’t you have business account on Instagram? And maybe any comments on Instagram and it’s current algorithm? How do you find it?
I am from Iraq thats really interesting to know where  u r from ...love ur videos
Love your real ness ! Do another video if you can. 😘
loved this video!!! thanks for answering re: earning on youtube!
which foundation are you using here?? your skin looks amazing, and also what's on your lips?? :)
we wanna see your dad !!! :D wanna see the resemblance ;) :P
Really interesting to hear about your work and how you make a living. You sound very passionate about it. Would love to learn more about how you ‘do business’ and how hiring people to help you has allowed you certain freedoms or the ability to fast track or grow your blogging.
Can't wait for the Vlogs!!😘😘❤️❤️
Know I would love to see your mum speak Arabic 😍
I love this video , thanks for being so honest and real 😘please do a part to , would love to know how you got into YouTube ?  Xxxx
I thoroughly enjoyed this video. I've been following you from the early days and this is one of my favourite videos. Looking forward to the DNA video!! x
Why are your eyes so far apart?
I would love to win your giveaway 😍😍
I must say, you guys have literally shaped my childhood into what it is. I usually write my books to your music because it really gets me in the zone. My dad finds it funny that I can relax to bands like Metallica and then go completely hyper whenever I hear anything to do with you :)
Brasiiil!! likes

Hey Europe! Where is the melody? Where is the power? Why you lost it all? Why today you can't write and play some good song like before?
europe nunca foge das suas origens sempre mandando esse som pesado porém com a voz totalmente absurda do joey canta muito o rock ainda vive minha gente adoro de paixão essa banda i love EUROPE I LOVE JOEY AMO 😍😍😍🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤 BRASIL RS
This make me feel soo young again...wow
I won't be a hypocrite. I love this band, their last album and this new song show their amazing talent, but what happened to their style? It totally changed. They don't seem to have a brand identity anymore. They don't sound anything like before. Even Joey Tempest's voice is different. 25-30 years ago, I loved this band because of such songs as Cherokee, More than Meets the Eyes, Open Your Heart, Prisoners in Paradise, etc; in other words, beautiful melodic hard rock songs. Now they sound more like Deep Purple or Led Zeppelin. That's not what got them famous. They got famous from their style 25-30 years ago. As a hardcore fan for over 30 years, I feel a little let down.
Walk the Earth... Out of this world.
the best for ever rock
What a fantastic masterpiece again.\nI`ve preorderd the album a few days ago and\ncan`t wait for the release.
Like a fine fine wine these guys mature and get better with age
Been following my gods of rock for ages and seen them live for a bundle of times. There songs is brilliant and the live performance is beyond reach. And this new song is so friggin Brilliant i cried when i first heard it. Avesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is the best band in the world
I will buy the album,that's for sure!!!GREAT SONG!!!
On an indefinite day of 30 years ago and more Out of this world the voice came !!!\n\nJOEY TEMPEST ... the absolute! After him ... nothing!
Great!!! G R E A T!!!!!!!!!
Best part of the video 1.36 to 1.51 . .. listen to Joey
AAAAAAAHHHHHHH SO BEAUTIFUL I'M WAITING FOR FULL ALBUM DJDJSHSVDKSSBVD OMG I LOVE EUROPE YEAH\nps come to POLAND PLS

drängarna
I hope the album is more rock
Europe meets Kashmir! And I love it!!  :D
Love this song 😍 congratulations guys 😉 love you FOREVER !!! ❤❤❤❤❤\nCome  to Portugal,  please 😭
Those who disliked this video are filled with SHIT!
Tears in my eyes! Thank you. I bought my verry first single as a child. It was  the final countdown of cause. My brother laught about me and about this pop music. Back these days. Today he is one of youre biggest fan
como eu amo essa banda <3 são incriveis desde os anos 80
For some reason I recognize the melody for the refrain from somewhere else..
I love this guys!!
Europe you are ture rock legends awesome video walk the earth  keep on writing awesome songs 😊😊
From all the legendary come backs I think yours guys really stands out. Amazing
Congratulations for this video I'm very proud of you. You deserve  the best with this new album. I have not stopped seeing it all day and every time I like more. It is very mysterious to me in some things but if you are happy is the most what it matters .Together walking the Earth with heart and Soul like champions
Love the track and the video, keep on rocking!
Good...but i think very similar to NLIT and NSSTB. It can be more....
Somebody have to make video for  this song together with Game of Thrones parts
Europe at it's very best.
At 0:34 it seems the Sports Hall from 86's The Final Countdown video, only now it's decayed. I don't go on with parallels, 'cause I still love Europe: the song is great, but it deserved a more uplifting video.
Very good video and song!
So great ! Thank you .
Every band sooner or later try to do their own Kashmir...
Verse reminds me of Deep Purple - Fingers to the Bone.
More carpets to a god of carpets!
Joey should've worn the purple jacket from Superstitious instead of that fur looking thing!
Can't wait for the record,amazing song
Absolutely love this song and video!!!  You Dudes definitely know how to Rock!!! Looking forward to your USA tour!!
Que gusto da saber que con el pasar de los años Europe se mantiene intacta en cuanto a su calidad musical, pero caminando hacia  adelante con nuevos aires evolutivos en propuesta. \nEurope son un ejemplo de lo que es pasar de las modas.

Otroligt duktiga musiker och sångare som jag har följt sen Europe blev känt. Denna låten ger mig härliga rysningar, mystiskt och samtidigt lite melankoliskt. Ni är bäst 😚💜
Europe sono come il vino; più passa il tempo e più è buonissimo. Vi adoro da sempre ❤🍀.
EUROPE FOREVER ... FROM INDONESIA

Har dem någonsin låtit bättre!!!?? Amazing!!!!
Melhor Banda de Todos os Tempos....Brasil ❤😍
Great tune! Miss johns Fender sound though. Imagine that solo with the sound from the Wings of tomorrow album. Would be a killer.
Europe, my favorite band all over the others i have listen to. Such great inspirated songs like Memories, Scream of Anger, Children of this time, In the future to come, Open your heart, Dreamer, Stormwind, Wings of tomorrow, Coast to coast, Danger on the track, Rock the night, Let the good times rock, Carrie, More than meets the eye, The Final Countdown, Dance the night away, Seven doors hotel, I'll cry for you, Superstitious, Cherokee... all of them such great. And you guys are still here giving the best! Thanks for that! Have a great time and keep it up! Congrats!!! I hope i could have been in your concerts and listed to the raw sound of Europe! But i just found you all months ago. Your music is... there are no words to describe it!!! \n~Joakim B. Nordurljósson~ \ni hope one day i can have a great band with original songs and sounds! 
*I found a little Deep Purple feel on it!* 😉
Norum and Leven should be on a diet, they´re turning into pigs.
I think it sounds a bit too muffled making the song boring everything els is great.
6 unlike. \nFans Bon Jovi? ;)
Tom is right about tubes.  I have had a tube pre-amp for the last 20 years.  When I was auditioning equipment in an audio store, I heard 2 or 3 solid state pre-amps and then when the guy hooked up the tube pre-amp, the difference in the warmth of the sound was immediately apparent.
To:  Tshandy1,  Gosh, how right you were to mention his chain smoking.   What a shame.   This is a huge  loss to American Rock.
I have a Buddhist book called This is good shit
I could watch this all day
Friends who both died at home in LA at age 66
God bless both of them!
smoking is one of the causes of heart attacks.\nScary....they both died at age 66....
Just enjoyed being able to feel like I was just hanging out with these two. Just a casual hanging out with the cameras rolling. Wish more celebrities would this!
Forever in time this clip of two American cultural icons coked out of their heads--or, coming down--shall enlighten us and the morons alike.
RIP may your memories be eternal blessings - you are both very loved and really missed
Tom Petty  was just laid back and funny, great musican. He did some great tunes.  RIP Tom Petty..
It looks like Garrys lips aren't moving while he is talking
Buddhism and few other Eastern religions have become very popular among a certain coterie in Hollywood and elsewhere. When I think about so-called practitioners, Garry comes to mind as someone who tried as honestly and purely as possible to rid himself of all ego and desire. Moreover, he always gave the impression that, despite his efforts, he had a long way to go.\n\nSadly, there are people who claim to be not just Buddhists, but reincarnations of long dead lamas. Steven Seagal, to be explicit. I can't think of a worse advertisement. Fat, dyed hair and beard, self-absorbed and an inveterate liar. And a shit actor.
I used to have a vacuum tube stereo and it had a different sound that digital the sound was very unique. That's why people going to back to LPS
RIP both great fun dudes. Wow, these two were so talented in their respective fields- nuts. They seemed like they were good friends. I didn't know GAry was into audio. Tom has one of the few Nieve boards. One of which was first shown at the now defunkt Sound City studio. Dave Grohl ended up with a Neive mixing console as well- the one from Sound City where his band recorded Nevermind.  Tom produced a few albums there including his great Damn The Torpedoes record- RIP Tom.
God bless the both of them.  Freight train 🚭🚬
i want to make an original comment, RIP everybody, RIP,  , now that took a lot of thought an prayer , RIP everybody and Jesus saves !
I Reilly enjoyed watching this. LOVE ! Very good thing.
Strangest episode of curb your enthusiasm I’ve seen yet.
Really love both these guys.
So when was this?
Two Giant's in they're field RIP Gary and Tom  you left us too soon..
this is totally cute.. with a good lot of awkwardness in there.  i guess the ppl filming didnt help tom's nerves.  i'm sad i didn't see this until now.  very precious  :-)
thank you  tom petty!shandler! ! I.N.F.U!(its kinda private  people, its a kinda love that accepts u for who u are, u know?) yes yes yes  i had jesus too, it was great....he got it right, he got it right..fly high dear tom.
Thank you for posting this!!!
both died of a heart attack
They are together again! RIP to two great men.
They were both 66 when they passed.  We miss you, gents.  Great laughs and great music.  Respect and Rest In Peace and condolences to those close to you.
stuff needs a home.  which costs a fortune. TP was a great rock n roll historian deserving of so much great stuff.
When is the Heaven video of these two coming out
Priceless and thanks for sharing it
This was a really great clip.  Laughter is the best medicine.
Wow both died at the same exact age.
Interesting, they both died at the age of 66.
He is saturated in cigarettes & just ashes anywhere. lol 8:02 He's lucky he made it to 66.
Miss you already tom. love both you guys. RIP.
Smoking can lead to an early stroke & weaken your heart. RIP Florida Tom Petty  #Gainsville
Chain smoking Camels? Well now we know why he died at only 67....stupid.
I love this whole deal.... it's not two celeberties having a conversation... it's just two friends hanging out.... good stuff......
both dead now, Shandling was weird but Tom Petty seemed like a decent bloke, a clever man, unpretentious
13:07...Life is short, but not short enough, said Gary Shandling.   makes me sad.
Both these guys died the same way....very eerie
Give me the names of the 20 thumbs down. I will find them...
Watching this and said to ourselves,'How ironic to see these two together today.' Rest In Peace Gary and Tom.
every day is a blessing
Rest In Peace Tom and Garry. We Love You!
Tom's cool- Gary's neurotic as hell.
They both die suddenly and at the age of 66.  Freaking weird
I cant believe they've both moved on.....RIP,  both of you
Tom seemed like such a sweet guy. Easy going. Sad to lose good people like this.
Two really cool guys.  RIP Tom and Gary.
Who goes visiting his friend with a camera crew? A Jewish friend, that's who.
I can't stand seeing all of these great talents and truly wonderful people leave the world. To state the obvious, it just sucks.
R.I.P GARY and TOM , were gonna miss you guys.
This is great. Two legends having fun. RIP
He was a puffin.\nDont ever smoke kiddies. It effects your heart even if you quit.
So sad to see Tom puffing away...he would probably still be alive if he got on top of that one. anyway, both great minds and great spirits.
RIP , , soo good to see this. a very special 20 minutes,,,thanks.
So hard to watch.  Gone too soon. Both geniuses...
love them both rest in peace
when was this done?
Didn't know he was a chain smoker
THIS IS FASCINATING! I Love every second of it.
Tom and Garry hanging out. LOL. Love it.
Thats it im throwing this pack of cigs away, im never going to smoke again
Wow they both died at 66 and both had heart atacks
I have never seen this before, or even knew about Garry's interviewing show. Or whatever this is. But... WOW. This is amazing. I was a kid when I accidentally discovered the Garry Shandling show and the quirky humor. I was bummed when it ended, and didn't like the Sanders show as much but I didn't know anyone else who was into his humor as much as I was. I was also raised on LOTS of Tom Petty from my dad. So seeing this...  Wow. what an awesome and hilarious pairing.
I'd like to think that Tom and Gary are doing this exact thing right now...
Wait, Garry Shandling is dead also?
Nice!
Together now. RIP. :(
Both gone...sad...
Wow
Made me 😢
Damn...Tom is sucking those cancer sticks down. RIP guys.
Amazing love
3 cigarettes in 5 minutes, wow, Tom.
PRICELESS!
Hnnnnnnnggghh........Right in the feels
smoked camels, eh?
Camels no filter.
They went down swinging.....
Chain smokers never win.
Tom Petty smoked?
Neve board - German made.?
Tom was more normal than most.
7:05, bingo.
5:55 eerie
Excellent.....
2016-2017, worst years EVER!  :(
http://whyquit.com/whyquit/notables.html
Are they high?
R.I.P.  Gary & Tom!  :(
One never knows .
dont smoke kids!
Crying forever.
Both unfortunately died aged 66.
The smokes are a killer.  RIP Tom
Cigarettes killed him.
chain smoking....not good....i quit sep 1 2016....it was HARD...wish TP did
Her hand is shaking because of nervousness \n.\n.\n.\n.\nSO CUTEEEEEE😍😍 LOVE YOU DEMI

Don't you love it when she laughs ahahahah she's too cute
She is extremely beautiful
She's so beautiful 😭😍🔥

Her voice has changed !
DEMI LOVATO IS THE MOST SINGER IN CAMP ROCK \nALL DEMI SONG IS MY COLLECTION \nDEMI IS WIN FOR ME\nTHIS IS ME
I was so proud of her lmao 😂

they should've done a song from Sonny With a Chance smh
Was that skyscraper in Spanish
She also recorded This Is Me in Spanish. It's called Lo Que Soy, which translates back as What I Am, which is more or less the same meaning as This Is Me

Amo ¨rascacielos¨ de Demy \nGracias a ella encontré confort en mi ser
rascacielos(skycraper) if i dont remember bad is pero te juro que al final sola me voy a levantar ,como un rascacielos  i remember more than demi
Pero te juro que al final  (But I promise that in the end)\nSola me voy a levantar  (I'll get up by myself)\nComo un rascacielos.   (Like a skyscraper)\n\nThose are the lyrics :) Although I always preferred her spanish version of This Is Me much better than that one.
YAS
Very impressive!
thats actually really nice, i might let a patch of grass grow up next year to try this.
Thanks for this
I prefer to make my rope out of the flesh of the inevitable zombie horde that I know is coming. Very strong and flexible.
Could i hang myself with it?
I know how to make it since my childhood as a villager😉
I honestly thought you were going to make a noose to test the rope.\n\nLove you man, please don't test your rope by making nooses.
I wanted to know this for quite some time and I subscribed now.
isn't this called yarn rather than rope? i think if you want to make rope you need to take this product and repeat the same process but with yarn rather than individual grass strands.
Wow what a great idea!
3:35
A bowlin' knot?
can you use the rope to commit suicide?
More handsome and younger version of Ted Cruz
This is awesome, but I have to ask, Why didn't you use the tape from a few VHS's?
You should try to make a bow string. Lightweight of course.
Haha thats pretty slick! I never imagined it would be that simple. Good intel tx.
A wise man can learn from his mistakes and if he is wise and compassionate, then he shares what he has learned. Thank you for posting this. So many others who do these kind of preparedness videos totally discount the use of grasses for rope making and you just showed that it is not only viable tool to make, but practical as well as you use the one fiber that can be found almost anywhere on earth.
i like the resolution.
Get this guy on Alone haha.
Should be called: how to hang yourself for free
Wish I knew this
If this guy were born on the stone age, he would have started an entire civilization.
Riveting intro.
so if you made a pine sap / charcoal and deer scat resin, coated this and let it dry it would be insanely strong? I like the idea you can make a basket style backpack with framework and even straps out of this rope. Very cool.
Nice work, i really enjoyed the video.
Can you make a grass rope weapon or a grass rope boat to go sailing around the world like the Egyptians and Africans did thousands of years ago ?
I downloaded both of you rope making videos. Thanks for sharing. Not sure if I will ever need this technique, but if I ever will need it I know now how to make both ropes. One with green grass and one with dried grass.
*Now i can kill myself with grass*
Cockeyed thumbnail that is all goodbye!!!
Let's see if you can make something from cattail  stalks. Can you try to make a basket or some other woven type of item with it? Cattails are common in most of Canada and the U.S.
for a more natural suicide
N o o s e
is it just me or.... what frame rate is this shot in?? LMAO
I thought you could and you just showed us, well done.
That should come in handy next time I'm taking the One Ring to Mount Doom.\n\nUnless someone already made that reference in the old video.
I think you're really good at explaining stuff. I actually listened and watched this whole video. I also learned something new. Thank you! You're awesome.
I see some disc golf in that yard.
only nighthawks beat round the bush to find grass
If you live just west of where i live there is no rope making material:(
Nice! A project that any budget can handle. :)
Whoa a new improved method! This was one of the most important survival tips I've learned and now it's even better.
Hey its vinny vinesauce teaching me how to make rope.
Amazing video as usual. This one I'm going to try for sure. A bit more detail on waterproofing would be useful !
nice way of making a noose.
Thanks.  Quite helpful.
wtf am doing here ???????
8:11
love the video
Survival bondage improvisation
Grope
Interesting video Thanks
I see shai La Beuf
Very cool, thank you.
Good video.
This is soooo useful! :D Thanks a lot! And easy tooooo
This is soooo useful. . . . . .in a post nuclear holocaust world with apocalyptic circumstances!  You know, when all the normal rope is disappeared or burned to ashes.  Imagine the horror of living in a world without rope! It's gonna happen so pay attention!
Please never sell out......\nDont become Grant Thompson
Hard to take advice after seeing your vice set-up.
So it looks a little bit nicer in the end.  Which end?  I'm confused.\n\nPrimer:  C'mon, guys, wake up!  Where are all the rope puns?  What are you a frayed of?  This is knot cool.  I'm gonna wrap this up.
Wow I've never seena  video like this on youtube..
I'm making this rope right now! It's really quick without much practice !
thank you, it's useful to make a suicide rope
when it comes to grass, I find the more you use, the happier you are with the end result.
and if you want to make even stronger rope you could take 3 of these and and wave them (like: swap left with middle, then middle with right, and then left and middle again and so on)
love your videos. you should test the strength in a more scienticic way you know with the weight and length and flexibility and how much strength it actually looses when it gets wet or dry. sorry if  i sound like a university professor
Great now people can still hang them selfs when they leave there noose in the car
Make concrete from scratch or build a clay house
Great! Strong enough to hang myself before I starve to death
You're always great, thank you
try pulling a car with it that will definitely tell its strength.
can you whip with it?
Its also good to feed to cattle or rabbits if you have some, after use and without any coating or oil/tar treatments of course.
I'm wondering what other plants you would use instead of grass like maybe inner tree bark I've heard that might work
Where did you lean all your skills?
It's not immune to cows and can't be made in Antarctica too, except for hair
Now I can hang myself with nature
Awesome, thanks for keeping it simple and useful.
You could also test it even further with a mechanical advantage from a lever
It's more like 80-85 pounds because you're also pulling the rope.
Only one more way to conclusively  test it.....
Bark fiber works well for rope. Watch some videos from Primitive Technology.
how thin can ya go \ndestruction test please
You have Frisbee golf course in your yard?
WOW! WOW WOW
legend

@TheKingOfRandom
Hey Ben! I really enjoyed this video, and appreciate you taking the time to share your knowledge with us! I just wanted to point out however, that I prefer your old style of video with the voiceover narration. They seemed highly professional! \nThese videos are still top quality content though because you don't ramble and make effective use of demonstrative clips! I just thought I would voice this sentiment for your information, and hopefully to encourage you to do more videos of the old style.\n\nKeep up the good work!
Here is some Korean ladies making rope, looks like they have quite a good method.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMV-Rrhyz64
has any one even notice the tree that the guy is next too has a face! o.O come one people just take a look at it. Eyes, nose, mouth. O.O if you look closely enough you actually see like it has some arms and legs morphed into it. lol
improve your videos by LESS chit-chat and MORE action, thanks....
That was sweet! Thanks for sharing, I'll try this next time I'm camping
Would this be even stronger if instead of twisting you braided the rope?  And then you shouldn't need to make sure the lengths of grass are the same thickness
cool video
I love these videos. Very practical and not gimmicky like some other DIY channels out there (DIY Perks) :3
What is that piss filled bong doing in the background?
This was a pretty interesting tutorial. Much easier than braiding it. That is what I originally thought you were going to be doing.
I was gonna say he was very biased to how good the product was because he's getting paid to say good things about it. Then it hit me...
If you decide the rope isnt long enough can you just undo the knot and lengthen it without problem?
Oh no she'll be a crazy cat lady by next year
She's such a precious tiny little baby!!!
Gus is so big now
could someone tell me what breed of cat daisy and gus are?? i think they are adorable!
i don't want her to grow up omg she's so precious
That kid who spread the bubblegum over her should die in a hot pot of bubblegum. She shoul DIE!
could you react to this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxyc-Hu250g you should show Rachel
OMG SHES THE (2nd)CUTEST KITTY IN THE WORLD(cuz I have a cat too)!!!😻😻😻❤❤❤💙💙💙💚💚💚💛💛💛💜💜💜💓💓💓💕💕💕💖💖💖💗💗💗💘💘💘💝💝💝💝💞💞💞💟💟💟😺😼😸😹😻😽😿😾🙀
Omg Colleen I have a cat and her name is daisy as well

[muffled thriller playing in the background]
I like how steve isn't just a jock, but more of a regular cool guy. He's rich, and that's probably part of why he's got such an ego. But he's certainly not dumb, and is made quite relatable. I don't know if that was very common in teen comedies of the 80's: maybe they aren't quite as unidimensional as I think.\nAlso, interesting that the link between sex and death is twisted, since it's the prude girl that gets killed, because she stays alone.
You guys are killin it! Can't wait for part three.
Where's the Martell video that was promised? 😩
Great job with these.
Are you ever going to do a Film Noir or Prisoners video in time for Blade Runner 2049
This is a very good show and I love the videos u guys make
Yessss, Freaks & Geeks references!! <3 Great video!
Drew Barrymore needs to make a cameo in the next season of Stranger Things. Let her play a cadaver or a monster or a heroine-addicted prostitute.
This deserves more views well done...
Great video, but that's not my Screen Prism narrator :-(
Love Freaks & Geeks!!!
I melt the world?
I can't wait for October 27!!!
what is this for?!\nuh... fun\n(pause)\nwell-OK\n\nLove that micro-scene.
Nothing about stranger things is origninal. But it holds its own, pretty well I guess
Emo?! Are you kidding me? The Clash aren't emo and emo had barely started in the mid-1980s?
Such a good show. Can't wait for season two
This show takes all the incredible parts of 80's horror and scifi movies and does it with modern storytelling perfectly
There might be an accidental 90s reference in there: Jonathan kinda looks like Edward Furlong, especially in Detroit Rock City.
MORE THE WIRE EPISODES PLEASE 😀
This is such a great channel!
No More The Wire Characters.
Youtube didn't even put this in my sub box. If I hadn't clicked on your channel I wouldn't even have seen this...

This show could change my life
Is Bronson getting that Carhartt money too?? Dude's a walking advertisement for them lol. Finna cop me some actually.
The name of the show should be Garbage Disposer lol
Go vegan
Where Can I get this game from?
This game is messed up ._.
Meanwhile in 2018...\nThis game will be turned into a garbage fandom like Undertale was turned into
such a master piece of a game
Masteripece! The satanic final boss is simply scary. It is impressive to see some demoniac transformations and behaviours in a funny 1930s context!
Tell me how he survived the Devil boss with one...WITH ON HP
There's a skip for the monkey crane game  boss on Mr Dice Man. If you match one set while he is at the edge of screen he will go off screen and insta die.
can't wait for the under 30 minute speedrun!
When a game is actually made with passion instead of money in mind
This was a joy to watch. Thanks for the upload and damn good speedrun!
Wow, it's just like the original Viewtiful Joe on the GameCube!
.. It's perfectly like watching a saturday morning cartoon.
This is incredibly imaginative. I love the visuals.
I didnt believe this speedrun until I watched it
That Sunflower stunlock... what the hell
bosses were always on the right side of the screen so why not have the timer showing on the left so it didnt cover anything?
It took me this long to beat that dragon bitch
Cuphead really reminds me of castle crashers for some reason
Devil: you have exactly 24 hour til-\n* kills devil after collecting all debtors souls *
damn you're good !  it's a difficult game no doubt
Hey would people dislike this they couldn't do better if they tried this is some of the best skill if seen lately
That first level took me an hour
do you eat ass for breakfast?
While this is quite awesome, I think it can quite easily be human-beat. There were quite a few times you double-backed on the platforming parts and you basically did no parries at all (which speed things up quite a bit). It would be neat to see some people try to challenge this amazing feat. :)\n\nEdit: And looking confirms, many people already have beat this time. :D
Seen this game as a downloadable one. The graphic is so classic
hollow knight and cuphead what a legend
what a crazy looking game. why didnt someone think of this before
took me 2 1/2 hours to complete this first time...damn robo boss and diceman
The dark souls of speed runs
The bosses remind me of Kirby bosses: weird, funny, and crazy stuff happening on screen, not to mention the awesome boss themes. You have to memorize the boss moves in order to succeed, at least, without getting hurt.
That is one really weird game in my opinion. I do not say it is bad but it is REALLY weird.
HOW DID I GET HERE???
The graphics are amazing. Great exclusive for the xb1. Really want this but it looks well difficult to master. All part of the fun I know but when a game gets me too angry I end up hating it. Thanks for the upload 🕹
Somebody in the comments is looking at this guy like show off...
This game is on some serious drugs.
Fuck. This is the new cancerous bendy community..
This ROBLOX game looks good. What's the link to it?
I honestly feel bad for the fish that Cala Maria randomly squeezes... Why tho
this game is amazing and it looks awesome...love the speed run
30:51 She started off super cute, then became terrifying XD
No black people looking like monkeys, eating watermelon, and acting jolly? Hahaha what a fail. Authentic 1930s MY ASS!
Are you allowed to pause the timer on load screens?
Yo this dude is a beast I had to edit the comment bc auto correct is a thing
that last one haha :D Clever, could probably cut some time if you used special attacks as soon as their off cd. And King dice that was scary :p hitting all of them right must be hard.
I'm curious, how much time do you save by doing the two run and gun levels first to get the charge weapon?
the animations are 100% old disney. absolutely awesome stuff. music, fantastic. the gameplay animations also remember me of the first rayman game from ubisoft.
a great plan is extra
What the heck happened to the flower guy he was stuck like that XD
Not going to lie that the Mermaid is fine as hell.
Wait, a robot has sacrificed their soul?\nEither the Devil doesn't know that robots HAVE souls, or Dr. Kahl is in some really sketchy activities.
cuphead is like a sonic game \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni dont know whats going on
28:13  tom and jerry in a nutshell!
Neat Run! Just finished the game for the first time and am no browsing youtube vids due less danger of spoilers.\n\nThought I may give ya an advice for trying speeding the run up. I Happen to encounter an out of range error for the King Dice Memory card game mini-boss. Killing him immediately. \nCoudln't recreate it yet, but it went kinda like this: I turned around a fitting pair of cards while going to upper left corner. He also went to upper left corner and into attack mode. I Took a hit, but the ape then moved forward out of screen. Yet he didn't reappear and got a Knocked out! \n Ironically how much that fitted. Maybe it helps you or other speedrunners in the future if you figure out a pattern there.
At first I thought he was taking damage to damage boost through long attacks but then I saw him die in the fight with the dragon...
And people say the unity engine is garbage
This game is easy compared to Metal Slug. The true Dark Souls of platform shooters.
Very impressive for a brand new game, a big GG
all most no death
nice looking game... Right back in the 40s
Good call skipping the tutorial.  That thing could take even a seasoned speedrunner 10 minutes, accounting for restarts.
Damn. Beat me too it.
When your mom says you have one hour left on your xbox
he broke the final boss
I was questionng why he was purposely hurting himself on flower.....holy fuck thats actually clever
Holy crap that machine learning is sure getting advanced...
Shot I can only pass the tutorial 😂.
It like Megaman, Mario. And steam boat Willie in one!!!!!🤣
Holy shit I thought it was 37 hours
For the first time, I feel Cuphead's smile is entirely justified.
I was not aware of this game untill now... boy, have I missed out. This style is AMAZING! wp on teh speedrun bud.
yo i noticed steam selling this game for 20$\nwhile you can buy it here for 10$-15$ (10% cashback+alot of disscounts can be found)\nwww.g2a.com/r/cuphead
Ugh all this spamming of the dash button slightly Triggers me
You or a BOSS at dis 😊😂
Cagney machine broke
30:50 oh shit its my gf
Nice
Faker is that you
good game
Easy
Awsome hacks
55:45 hahahahaha
Cagney carnation broke
Interesting looking game
Megaman X +  Contra III + Mickey Mouse= Cuphead... :-/
Bugueo
Great run!
This game looks fantastic.
Omae wa mou shindeiru NANI?
Poor firefly getting skipped
Your a beast!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Damn, nice! wp
:DD
Ooooo Cuphead was difficult boo hoo
What happend with Cagney Carnation?! Golly! What a bug!
Wow
my mind is blown
wow juego diabolico
43:45 Wait..... what?
Steam Review: \n*Bad game, finished the whole thing in 37 minutes. Has potential tho.*
I just started getting into the cuphead fandom...
I will always belong to this family
I have to ask why supporters insist on saying “us” and “we”. It’s illogical. The club, any club, couldn’t care less about any of you. Supporters are customers. Cash cows to be milked season after season. There is no logical reason to invest time and money on what is now nothing more than business. What happens on the pitch is merely a side show, something to distract supporters from the truth.
This clown and all of you are deluded.. Alexis gives the ball away more than every other player in the entire premier league, check the stats from last year, he's the only player in the top six teams that's in the top 20 but he's in first place and gave the ball away 100 times more than the guy thats in second.. I can't say how much goals were given directly to the opposition  because of this guy's selfish style of hogging the ball and trying to dance with it every chance he get but it's a big fukkin problem and you guys have to stop with the special treatment all the time.. that's why he can't get along with Vidal in the national team because he's fukkin selfish when it comes to the football pitch.. we really should sell him in January because he wants to go anyways and we'd get a few quid out of it..
I like how no one here is a arsenal fan
Come on u Spurs \nArsenal are rubbish now you need new blood the management are complacent
DT is still only fun when they lose
Arsenal are doing good but DT u over expect everything. You said oh West Brom had chances u expect them to dominate every game of course the other team will always get shots off u can’t expect them to keep the opposition not have a chance.
Robbie you should make playlists for every team we play and add on them the next time we play them
Alaba you've had your 10 goals go away!
Again with the trending wtf is going on,but to be fair the lets talk about the game comment was hilarious 😂😂👍🏻
https://youtu.be/uupZlTULD1w this will help you get over your shit game
It is too early to talk about signs .. he is correct we have to see how we play away in the coming 5-6 premier league games.. Everton, Man City, Watford .. would be the test.. Hope we rest our players in europa and EFL cup .. and then put up a performance like we did at Chelsea and this time take 3 points not just 1.

Good job Arsenal! You have avoided defeat for weeks!\n\nIn other news, Robbie has reportedly been delaying his downpayment for a new mansion, citing 'temporary loss of income' as the reason.
Man Utd for life! We will win the league
In subscribing to anybody how subs me untill I reach 100 subs\nComment done
This guy is a mug
I dont get the sanchez haters.....i really dont. I said b4 its likely people who cheer on wenger that booo sanchez but its beyond that. I genuinely think they dont understand football and aint worth debating with.
The emerates has the worst atmosphere out of every league!
Next week well be very interesting goo.gl/b5Nh2T
DT is on point right there
when Arsenal win Robbie has to get 'creative' with video titles...
is this fatty ever happy if we had lost he'd be screaming we have to learnt how to win ugly theres really no pleasing arsenal fans take the 3 points and the clean sheet and move tf on
DT ...I hear you on the poor performance...but we slowly getting the 3 points...
I don't get it half the time we lose we moan we draw we moan we win we all still moan what the hells going on we still won don't care who were playing we still won lol
3-4-3 Formation is killing Arsenal's season
Really poor? They won two nil.
If Alexis leaves then let's see how this team copes. The guy was a star player for Barcelona in his last season
DT is only being like this because he deludedly thinks that he may stay.
DT complaints way over the top sometimes. why not win ugly and get 3 points than dominate and get nothing and still complain.
Mad that DT gets more views nowadays than Claude
DT is RIGHT! we're doing well against lesser teams but let's see it goes against the bigger clubs and I don't mean just drawing against them! I mean solid performances and wins. Coyg!
This bloke is a total cock !!!
Sanchez don't even want to be at arsenal why back a judus
DT needs. To chill relaxing like he's beast.
'Lacazette looks clinical, he hit the post today' ffs
DT is one of the few Arsenal fans who have a true sense of perspective. \n\nBut we all know how the season's story is going to turn out for Arsenal. We don't need DT's wisdom to tell us. Because we've been reading the same book for thirteen seasons.
When are arsenal fans going to understand that arsenal is a mid table team glory days are over
Why interview a moron? Couldn't give a toss what he thinks. Whinging bloke can't even speak English, I'm embarrasssed for him.
Am i the only one who cracks up when i see the view count that aftv have when arsenal wins and then compare it to when arsenal loses? Lol
C'mon DT just chill man. Every team has problems. I know Arsenal have been playing some shocking football, but can't blame the defence all the time. Look at Real Madrid today. They won 2-0 but Espanyol had 2-3 really good chances. I know that you had enough of poor Arsenal, but start supporting the team rather than critizising their every mistake.
They could have had this they could have had that... could have and should have are two different things!! Are you forgetting that arsenal also hit the bar and had more chances in this game?? Think you need to stop being a pessimist and support your club.
well said DT. today's game was just too slow and not scoring the needed goals
There is nothing left in football.
i thought crack was mental
DT is right on the money... except for the contradiction regarding the squad making progress. If we have the potential to compete for top 3 then that's clearly progress compared to previous analysis stating we probably won't make top 4. \nI'm Still #WO (since '08)
Alexis is the number one arsenal
Didnt know why iwobi was in the background.
Sorry but arsenal fan tv would not be the same if you won the league and cups because DT n Troopz wouldnt be mad. Love there reactions 💯👊🏼
Ramsey and Giroud totally overrated! There is more goals in Wilshire and Walcott at the moment!
While the Manchester clubs and Spurs are banging 4 against so called lesser teams, we are just about scoring 2 and riding our luck. Bigly. \n\nWe need to sort this defence and also get Sanchez, Laca and Ozil playing together. That front three could do wonders for us this season and when Jack gets in (if he can keep this form), our midfield can be way more creative than the staleness we are witnessing now. \n\nBut much of this wont matter if we dont sort this defending out. Wenger should try 4 at the back and see how we play. Its been a while but I think we'd be more solid.
Riding our luck Our xg was 2.9, Brighton's was 0.4. DT is a complete moron
I never even knew Alexis had haters he holds are team on his back he is Arsenal.
Give Aresnal team some credits pls... as for DT .. I dun know who u are... but seems like you are nothing but a very negative person.
I think Alexis, maybe because they both speak spanish, has a better understanding with Monreal than with Kolasinac, on that left side. Hopefully with more matches Alexis and Kolasinac can get a better undrstanding and improve each other performances , because Kolasinac is a beast, and Monreal is having a amazing season in his new position so i wouldn't change there positions.
Why is this even a topic. Laca should have played sanchez in for a tap in !!
This is actually trending. DT one of the best personality on AFTV
Arsenal should of won 5,6-0
People forget Alexis had some very rough international games where he lost the confederations cup and then lost 2 games (qualifiers). He´s got a lot in his head at this point, not only Arsenal, and this is not to make any excuses, but come on, those fans giving him shit... they should be bothering the board to get rid of Wenger and the lazy players, instead of bothering the only guy that gave everything for his team last season.
i like you DT but do you ever say anything positive
Did you see that ludicrous display last night?
DT is definitely the realest amongst all the other AFTV regulars. He may be biased towards some players but he lenient towards them when they’re shit. I like him better now than when he was all “Wenger Out”.\n\nNot saying that Wenger should stay beyond the 2 years though. ;)
wtf is happening peeps bitchin over Sanchez get a grip,i do agree with DT we are riding our luck
Alexis fan tv, kissing his ass while he disrespect ur club lol. Smh
Arsenal is shit, Chelsea for the win
I hope you're dream comes true my dream is to get 100 subscribers by the end of the month can you please help me with my dream?!!
Once we  start playing the ball sideways it is Xhaka's role to collect the ball and spread the ball to the right forward. When the game gets boring we should blame him, he is our engine at the same time passing the ball sideways can be a way to rest after running so much and try to pull the opponents. #wearethearsenalfc
Again DT is absolutely right! Arsenal progress with frail teams but crumble ever so easily against big and technically strong premier league clubs. If Arsenal beat Any of the top 6 teams away the same way we beat lowly rated clubs in the premiership, then the world can take our title credentials very serious, as it is there's no amount of points you can amass from smaller clubs that can justify winning the premier league trophy.
Robbies just thinking about how he's getting to Ibiza next week, by his private yacht or his private jet?
Arsenal is shit end off.
City and spurs gonna smash Arsenal 5 nil
these ungrateful fat fucks never touched a ball in their greasy lives stfu!!!!!!!

UNITED IS GONNA WIN THE LEAGUE!!!!!
May God be with the victims and their families😢😢😢
😢😭😢 thanks for sharing. God Bless those victims in Las Vegas😢😢
At 24:41 right before the 3rd verse of Bridge Over Troubled Water you can hear Keith Urban play a quick snippet of Free Fallin' as a subtle tribute to Tom Petty who also passed away yesterday.
See this, Hollywood?  This is how you conduct a vigil without turning it into your own political soapbox.
Thanks for sharing this
Thanks Amy what a beautiful prayer full of the Holy Spirit
My heart hurts for all !! God bless them all!
God Bless their souls and families.... No words.. Lord hear our prayers for ALL!!
If this video can get to trending with 8.5k views, then anyone can. #PrayForVegas
Don't believe everything you see on TV.
Thank you for sharing.Praying for all affected & this world. #MayGodsMercyAndLovePrevailOverAll
We will never forget. God bless to all.
Alison Krauss is so breathtaking. I get chills every time I hear her sing. She has the voice of an angel. My god be with all the victims from the vegas shooting. 🙏🏻
Such a senseless tragedy in Las Vegas. Many thanks to Keith Urban, Vince Gill, Amy Grant and Alison Krauss who all used their incredible gift of voice to help try and console.
God bless the Las Vegas victims, Puerto Rico,San Juan,Barbuda,Dominica,\nHatti,Texas,Syria,\nYemen,Samolia and the Black men who have been shot and killed by the police. Black Lives Matter. God bless the USA in the era of Trump.
These are the kind of idiits killing america. Ignorant filthy god cult psychos. Shut up !!
See people if you just would have prayed harder at the last mass shooting, we wouldn't be dealing with this now.
Looks shady to me. Nobody talking about Trump investigation anymore? This seems like a Russian conspiracy to distract from Trump's investigation.
God bless these families,I pray for you all. God be with you.
Wow that was powerful. I love the amazing grace song.
This is a beautiful tribute to alll we have lost! My heart goes with the victims familes!!
Prayers don't do shit.  Time for action.  Your God helps those who help themselves.
Couldn't hardly listen to go rest high on that mountain. Played that at my grandfather and great grandmothers funerals. God bless the victims of this terrible act of evil, and god bless this great nation and assist us in condemnation of acts of terror such as what we experienced.
am pray to
God Bless

The ones who died before the age of 41, the age of responsibility, they are in Heaven and having fun and laughing at us, while we are suffering over here. So worry about your own neck. The Almighty Creator made a covenant with us long time ago that If we DO NOT pray and thank our Creator every day for the roof over our head, for our jobs in order to get His provisions, for our health and protections, and if we do not pay 10% of our earnings to the needy relatives, fatherless children, and homeless people, then we Should NOT expect any protection from our Creator, yet He has given us enough respites. And now we have the scientifically proven scripture based on mathematics, the exact sceince to prove that. But, media and illiterate preachers have been raping our hearts and souls for just a few $ and they turned us to a Godless nation, and bunch of idol worshipers. That is why we have been bringing disaster after disasters upon ourselves with our own wrong doings.
Middle aged white guy murders 50. Time to put Nevada in the TRAVEL BAN, Donnie. NRA spent $60 million on GOP during election. BLOOD MONEY.
Praying... so kind.\n\n_Sigh._ Why the fuck don't we take some action instead of talking to our invisible friends?
what you can do is STOP WHITE SUPPREMISIT HATE CRIMES!
Alexandra owned that dance!! Nice to see the judges give it so much love too ;)
This was *LIT* - cannot wait to see how firey their Argentine Tango is gonna be (whenever they get it)
If they are shagging \nI definitely don't blame her 😂
Amazing for second week
Great British people, I am calling for you to vote for this amazing couple! As I can not do it myself from Czech republic, please keep amazing Gorka and fabulous Alexandra until the finals! And I am going to watch this ten more times.
Alexandra as good as as pro - in 2 weeks !! Paso Doble and Alexandra made for each other
WOW!!! ........and only week 2!! Gorka.......you really hit the jack-pot when you were partnered with this girl!!!!
i sincerely hope that alexandra and gorka don't get the same treatment that natalie gumede and artem got a few years back. in my opinion, natalie has been the very best dancer to appear on strictly (with, or, without previous experience argument). alexandra could well equal the achievements of natalie. absolute pleasure to watch over and over again.
After this I wanted to dance. I did...\n\nI danced against a door and now my head is aching. \nWhat is my life?
Brilliant  ! Praise also to the wonderful orchestra and singers who are so talented.Great lighting too.
A week later, and I STILL haven't recovered 🤗
I think I have a weird obsession with this routine.. I keep creepingly coming back to watch it.. can't get over it.. and I know this may sound weird but I want them to date.. they are such a great looking pair... Shipping them so hard...
SLAYYYY
One of the best dances ive seen on strictly, loved it! They've got such amazing chemistry together and Gorka, be still my beating heart!! 😍 I thought no one could replace Aljaz as my number 1 strictly crush but Gorka's giving it a good go lol
A dance to watch more than once,I would have liked to see it go on for lot longer, love the song,brilliant for me Latin dancing is King.
This felt like the first moment of the series.And in a frankly not too deep field this year,barring accidents, she's a finalist.I have to say I haven't quite warmed to her yet,but that's more about me with driven people.This was a delight by the way.Also I felt she was strangely undermarked last week.
This is one of the best dances I have seen on strictly. The song was just perfect too.. I like that they did the Spanish version. But I agree with what Darcy says, the way Alexandra expresses herself to the music is amazing to watch.
I genuinely can't believe the intensity she attacked this with and the difficult technique that she nailed - amazing.
Who knew she could be this intense? I thought I would pass out after watching this dance
I think that is a very good example of somebody who understands ballroom dancing and the little details of flamenco (paso doble). Very well executed by both.
I feel like that would've been even more powerful if it had a traditional paso song. The salsa feeling kinda threw me off, which is why i wanted to watch it some more. Wow!
They definitely saved the best till last. Fab-u-lous as Craig would say. Alexandra danced like a pro, and Gorka looks hot. Not my overall favourites, but one of them (I think it's hard to have a fave this early). It's a 10 from me.
Gorka’s Sexy As Hell
This is like Alexandra Burke in week 3 of Xfactor with candy man
This is perhaps the only time I've thought that Jennifer Lopez song has ever sounded good, haha! A thrilling paso. There were a few rough spins and I wish that the walking transitions looked a bit more musical rather than rushed. Nonetheless, the 36 was definitely justified, in my view. Great choreo from Gorka and it really showed off Alexandra's grace, speed and power.\nOverall, I'm rooting for Alexandra. Despite (thankfully) the few idiotic bores further down in the comments section playing into misomelangyny and claiming she's 'arrogant' and 'up herself', she's a very talented, professional and unassuming entertainer that evidently not only dedicates herself to her craft but also – more importantly – enjoys it. I sincerely hope she gets into the final.
If thats how she preforms the Paso, I CANNOT Wait for her Tango and Argentinian Tango
Where the 40 at?
Que arte♡
Amazing xxxx
Fantastique
Cough cough decency please Man!
Possible Strictly winner??!!
OMG love this girl. Amazing and only week 2. It's gonna be fantastic final. Betting on Alexandra, Aston and Debbie in final.
Seriously undermarkef
Brilliant.
😍😍😍

On da floooorrrr

Honestly rewinded this dance more than 10 times last night. Parents got annoyed so I went to bed- secretly keeping watching on YouTube. You're my faves guys- literally was dreaming last night I was dancing with Gorka
YASSSS work alex!! best dance on strictly in a while

She started of really good but her nerves kicked in you can see her legs shaking and a view steps missed but all in amazing for UK
We love Strictly and this year there are so many brilliant contestants
She dancing with her massa
Its just a lot of flicking around, kinda easy!
This dance!!! OH MY GOODNESS
This was of a quality not even seen in the final by all but a few of the winners.
No she did no just slay my life
The best in years since Alesha and fit Gorka too! Loved this in ironic Spanish
I am now at the age where I have started to watching Strictly.. Where is my pipe and slippers?
My new single Two Sides To You is now available on Spotify, iTunes, Amazon, GooglePlay and more! \nHead over to my Facebook page to get the links! \nFacebook.com/SayshaWilliamsMusic. Xo
I love strictly come dancing
I Also Think Alexandra & Gorká Would Earn The 2017 Glitterball!
I've watched Strictly Come Dancing since it launched and no-one has ever danced a paso doble with such power and commitment. I just wanted to scream with power! OLE ALEXANDRA! If this was not week two, that would have been 40!
I couldnt keep my eyes of her.. her every move was so entertaining and beautiful as well as passionate.. the chemistry between the both was on another level in this performance
She is going to WIN this show
Yaaaaaaaas that was so fast!!!
My favourite couple on Strictly Come Dancing this year love them!
This would have been amazing at any stage... but for week two?  Outstanding!
Alexandra is just beyond talented, she owned x-factor and now Strictly too. She’s a superstar.
Alexandra Burke wow she was once a singer...
Genuinely thought Alexandra was one of the professionals in this episode omdsss
She was so hot and fiery I couldn't take my eyes off her... and Gorka had his gorgeous chest out! =P It was a dance worthy of a 10 or two; and if it wasn't only week two, I think we might have seen it.
I used to love her on X Factor but damn. Her dancing is as good as her singing!
she is an amazing dancer... she is a bit smug but honestly this is an unbelievable performance by her for week 2 of the show and not much experience
Great dance for Week 2. 9/10
They are smoking hot….Thank hmmm Gorka has a partner that can dance so we can see him in full view! Yum Yum Yum!!!!! Can’t wait for next week
Watched this back so many times now. Mainly, because at least the first 10 times I couldn't take my eyes off of Gorka, he's sooo pretty!!! Alexandra, though absolutely smashed it! You go girl!
Can't believe what I'm watching considering it's only the second week. AMAZING!
Alexandra and Gorka are simply the best better than all the rest better than anyone who's ever been on the show before things can only get better by the strength and sheer excellence of this dance
Oh my god\nHow beautiful is the male dancer!!!!!
I normally hate the Paso but this was so good :)
British clapping annoys the crap out of me. And i'm British.
Blooming heck that was amazing!
If only people were as passionate about spirituality and humanity as they are about dancing lol.
Wow what a performance  , never ever seen a pass like that . Alexandra  you can dance
I'm so glad this _hopefully_ means Gorka will get to stay in for the long run this year. I'm still bitter that he and Tameka were voted out in week 3 last year. I hope this is his year!
Hmm, I was thinking before it started: this'll be ok... 0.12 BAM!!! Jump-spin and the fireworks exploded. Definitely worth the score and the standing ovation from CRAIG that it received!
I'm still amazed at this & it's only the 2nd week!! Thrilled for Gorka who went out too soon last year!!!
Jls and the Saturdays face ...like WTF face lol hilarious
Uno what gets me\n Aston has more views for his dance. And I'm sorry he is certainly not as good as this. I now know he will win the show just cous he has biggest fan base not cool
They remind me of Normani and val anyone else?
Naturally Get Rid of Pigmentation & Dark spots \nhttps://youtu.be/YEwsstcNSl0
Used to admire Alexander when she won the Xfactor, she stated music was her life and all she wanted was to sing. Since her first album I've heard virtually nothing from her. As with most X factor winners they get one or two albums out and then give up and settle for doing adverts when their money runs out. She's still massively talented but I'm disappointed in her lack of commitment to what was her apparent dream.
She's still a little sloppy and lacks fluidity, so let's not sugar coat her ability to dance too much.
She's incredibly flat footed it's painful to watch 😬 she did a good job and that but her technique is not good but then it's only week 2
Omg she's absoulty stunning! Amazing dancer and so much passion! I hate all these talent shows but I'm a little bit tempted to start watching this one because of her but I won't
I do get annoyed when Alexandra talks but she is such a talented singer and dancer! This definitely tho is the performance of the night! Possible one of the best paso doble performances I've ever seen actually! 😱💚
Just curious if any of you women out there have complained to BBC about Gorkas outfit....or lack of? I mean after all, it is a 'family show'. I mean... .Dont you all go crazy when the pro girls show too much leg or tits? Amazing how quiet you all are when there is a 6 pack on show! Pffft.
I'm probably the only one who didn't enjoy this dance. I like power and attack but she came across as psychotic. I liked her dance last week more.
You strictly lot need to learn to dance this is how you do it http://youtu.be/uupZlTULD1w
Ohh shock shock another \nCompetitor that got a big applause .. for dancing well  ..\nOh I forgot they danced before??? it's a fair competion  ok let me see Aston ,Debbie ,Alexander ..I thought it was about stars that never danced before and see how they come on threw the weeks .. it's \nabit unfair as the dancers are a bit disadvantage .
Since when did John fashanu join the strictly contestants?
A great dance but you can’t compare her to the others. She has a lot of dance experience and shouldn’t be on an amateur dance comp against people with no dance experience at all
Another one who has been taking dancing lessons way before the series started..pathetic..
I don't get it, this just didn't have the paso feel that Debbie's had last week. Emperor's new clothes springs to mind...
Alexandra is also dance trained yet nobody seems to give her grief compared with Debbie
Who is the most annoying person in the world?\n\nAlexandra Burke by a country mile.\n\nMy idea of hell would be to be stuck in a lift with her....
Too fast and too aggressive needed more content. Thumbs down.

BEST COLLAB
I remember your post about the mummy's still got her tummy comment and it's actually what made me start following you. I didn't however realise that the comment had come from a NURSE!!!! That's absolutely horrifying to hear!!!!! They are the people who are supposed to reassure you and a really fragile time and the fact that she had the nerve to make such a shitty comment it appalling 😡
Would love you to do a video about PCOS and how you overcame it x
And you've done it again! Touched me with your honesty as if you were the little angel on my left shoulder that is telling me that everything is alright! THANK YOU GI! 😇
I never had an issue with my body was happy with it, felt I looked good, always dressed nice then my friend wanted to join WW to be bridesmaid to my wedding but was scared to go alone so I went with her for moral support. Now 3 years on I’ve lost 2 stone and weight myself daily, feel guilty for anything nice that passes my lips and hate my stomach so much it’s ridiculous. I needed to hear your little chat tonight to have a think back to my size 12/14 self who never even owned a set of scales and enjoyed her food. Thank you G, keep being awesome xxxx 😘
I have a trick which seems to work for me when I need a boost about my body.  I'm not sure if it's a good trick or if it has downsides but as I say, it seems to work.  \nHow would I feel about myself if I was the size I am now but had just lost half a stone or a stone in weight?  I'd feel great, really confident, able to take on the world.  Even though I'm still the same size I am.  So it's all about tricking my mind that I've already lost some weight, and bringing about those feelings from previous weight losses.  Or I'm just gullible, it might be that!   \nIt's also good to remember everyone is different - there is no one perfect body shape or height or weight.  And that most people at some point feel the same way about their body, well their life really, and will be more sympathetic than you might think. xx
after being a mom and giving birth10 times your body changes so much ,Just a sacrifice us moms do noy easy but worth it!thanks for sharing
Loved this video! I've never been that confident with my body and always thought I was fat compared to others where in hindsight I was actually just a good normal healthy weight, short yes (which doesn't help when I compared myself to all my tall skinny friends) but I had a flat tummy but curvy in the right places and quite fit (in an active way). I then started sixth form, started out in a new relationship where I was completely comfortable and gave up dancing and have struggled since trying to be happy and confident with my body which has affected my motivation with my appearance too. Currently I'm a size 10-12 and following slimming world to try and control my weight better and to get myself to where I'm happy. It was my 22nd birthday last week and I decided I would get up and spend some time making myself feel special. I done my makeup and my hair and then I got out a midi length bodycon dress and decided that after sitting and staring at it since I bought it last year, that I would put it on and honestly I am so glad I done it. I felt so much more confident and yes I don't have a flat tummy no more and my bum might not be as big and round as it was but that dress just made me feel amazing. I know it's a bit strange but I think it gave me the motivation I needed when I was really in a low point over the past month or so as I struggled keeping myself on track. I think all young people should watch this video Gi as you have told us how it is, yeah we might have some wobbly bits or scars that we may not like but really they all have a story and they are all part of what makes you unique. This is coming from someone who has had a skin graft on her face and used to plaster loads of makeup on every day just to hide it and now I don't wear any as it is part of me and really why should I hide what makes me different.
i've always been the skinny friend with the big boobs all throughout high school and my girl friends wanted my body. i still ended up developing anorexia at 22. i'm still fighting it, but the number of days when i love my body and don't need to punish it, has drastically risen. \nthank you for the message in this video, gi.
After suffering from anorexia for years and years I really appreciate super honest videos and posts like this my love!! Well done you, it why we all love ya! ❤️
That was wonderful! Thank you so much. It is really hard after having children, because part of you is immersed in this whole new life, while the other part is worried about feeling womanly and attractive again. My husband loves me whatever size, but I find when I am feeling less then I also feel like it effects my attitude and perspective. It's important to remember we can have good days and harder days, but knowing we are not alone in this mommy struggle really helps. Love you Gi! 🤗💜🙌
AH Thank you for talking about PCOS! It's hardly talked about in the US. so nice to hear someone else talk about it. It's a constant struggle for me and so many.
Do you know, the only body any of us need is a healthy body, whatever shape or size, as long as you are healthy and your body is healthy hen your winning!!!
Absolutely love this Gi! You’re so inspiring for every lady - from those who are incredibly body confident and those who unfortunately struggle!!\nThere are a few days when I feel great but unfortunately there are more ‘meh’ days outweighing them, this has been bringing me down and I have noticed that I have been more emotional over the last couple of weeks.\n\nI have found this video so helpful in realising that it is okay to have ‘meh’ days (and eat rubbish all day!) but then actually to look at yourself and say ‘You’re amazing! You’re beautiful! It doesn’t matter what anybody else says or thinks about you! You can do this! You’re on top of your game and no one can bring you down!’\n\nMuch love Gi!! Love you, Tom and the boys! 💜💙💙💙 xx
thank you Gi ❤️ I'm only 18 and I can't really remember a time where I loved my body or myself for that matter. Your videos inspire me to embrace who I am and to have a positive outlook on life!!
Thank you ❤
Totally love this. I have the PCOS too. The stretch marks are hormonal and related to the PCOS, even though you were so young.  I agree that you need to accept and give your body love and what it needs. I agree also that the fasting makes this body type feel wonderful. I fast two days every week, just eating 700 calories, and lose a little weight sometimes, but mostly, I feel great. Keep it up you are so cool.
Hi Gi! i'm not a mummy but i definitely understand the feeling of being or thinking i was the chubby kid  and feeling like skinny was in, i'm still in my 20's and i'm still working through my self-esteem and body image . I love your honesty and think you are absolutely gorgeous inside and out ! Thank you for being so inspiring <3 <3 <3
I've just been talking about the same thing lately! I used to be so hard on myself, and really nitpick, because I wanted to look perfect. There was a point where I looked just how I wanted to. Since having a baby, my body has changed a lot, you could say haha, but I'm okay with how I look, because it's who I am, and I have a great baby now.
Appreciate the honesty so much. I’m 16 and I know I compare myself to my friends and the supermodels I see everywhere I go so I’m very grateful to hear your story and hopefully take something from it ❤️
You have just completely voiced every thought I've ever had about PCOS and trying to get pregnant. Thank you for being so honest, you're an inspiration Gi xx
Honestly Gi, you are such an inspiration to me! I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 17 (now 20) and I have struggled majorly with my body confidence. Over the past few months I have discovered a lot more about how to manage my symptoms and have started to lose weight just through having changed a few things in my diet and being more conscious of what I'm putting into my body - it is crazy! Just like you I go through days where I get a little angry at my body but then I have days where I look at myself in the mirror and think 'wow, i do look good!' I just want to thank you for being so open about your experiences and about your body! I always love watching your little snip bits of PMAC training - I occasionally steal a few exercise ideas from your routines! Thank you for being you! <3
I've always been the larger one too.. probably a comfortable size 12, which I would kill to be now. \nI have had a baby, and I didn't quite realise how much my body would change! Since having my little girl, I have lost all my baby weight, and then some, but I feel fatter than I was. My stomach now sags with loose skin, as do my arms and thighs. I can probably cope with it, but it is defiantly an eye opener, as I was stupidly thought that my stomach would go back to roughly what it was. \nNow seeing my body, I am just the same as you, I wish I wouldn't have felt so awkward about myself back when I was a size 12, I looked amazing. \nHowever, I wouldn't take it back. The experiences I've had outweigh a smaller body. I feel like I'm the luckiest person ever. I have a wonderful husband and 16 month old daughter. Xxx
I had the same experience when I first got stretch marks! Except I was horrified because I thought they were scars and they’d just appeared overnight and I didn’t know what they were... and I never actually thought to ask anyone and just ended up working it out as puberty came and my hips and boobs got them too
It is amazing how a throwaway comment can affect our thoughts. I am 7 months pregnant and I recently was standing in a queue and a Spanish couple in front said (in Spanish) let the fatty go in front. I speak Spanish so was completely shocked and didn't say anything to them. It really hurt me for a while and I am now kicking myself I didn't say something.x
I had twins last year and it astonishes me the number of people who almost congratulate me for looking like I never even had a baby, let alone two.  Obviously it is meant as a compliment but it DID happen and it worries me how we live in this society that wants women to look untouched by the amazing things their bodies can do.
I'm at the heaviest I've ever been, being 200lbs. I don't feel like myself at all. I look at my face and it's plumper than I'm used to. I've gotten to size 14 pants and that's the end of normal sizes. I have to buy shirts in L and dresses in XL. I hate it. I can only wear certain styles of clothes because I don't want to bring notice to any of the rolls. And yet I'm scared of exercising because I'm scared of being nauseous. The weight has even given me acid reflux. My doctor told me that even 10 lbs down would most likely solve my problems. My BMI tells me I'm legitimately obese, but if you look at me I look pretty damn normal. Before anyone says BMI is flawed and I shouldn't use it, I should say yes it is flawed. However, BMI is still pretty good at telling the average person who's not an extreme athlete or body builder which weight range they're in. It's great for determining at risk populations of average people. Anyhow, what bothers me is that I don't look like what you think of when you think of obesity. So having the title of obese put on me feels really out of place. I've been trying to focus more on my food. Eating more whole foods and less processed stuff. Drinking more water and tea. Making sure I eat my meals and that they're well portioned and limiting my snacks to 2 healthy snacks between meals. Especially avoiding eating past 7pm. Hopefully I can change these things gradually because I'd really like to feel like myself again and express myself the way I used to.
How do I encourage my fiance who doesn't like his body or feel confident with his appearance? I've got plenty of support and advice for my sisters... but what can I do for him???
Honesty like this really encourages me and gives me perspective <3 Love this!
You are such an inspiration. I'm now 16 and have struggled with how I've looked since around age 8 and it's getting worse. I've always punished myself for how I look but it's now horrible looking back at photos when I was 12/13 and I was actually so thin from avoiding food yet I know I was still positive I was overweight but now at 16 I've changed again and I hate it, I hate everything about me and I'm struggling so much with it, I'm leaving for an amazing trip in a few weeks to Iceland with my school yet my anxiety is out of control because all I can think about is that on the last day we are going swimming, I haven't stopped thinking about that for over a year and I desperately no longer want to go just because of how I'm going to look. I just wish I looked like somebody else
Thank you Gi for honestly and openly sharing with the world all the time. I feel like I could hug you today watching this. I'm same age as you and only the other day looked at young 20 something me and thought omg remember when your skin was that clear and young and fresh and you could do anything. Age is experience but youth is amazing too only when it has been lived through.
As long as I can remember iv been really self conscious of my body. All the way through high school all my friends were tiny and I always felt the odd one out, and I even had comments thrown at me in the school corridor about my size. I'm now 21 and still hate the body I'm in, and seem unable to loose weight yet at the same time have no motivation or energy to work out and push myself to loose it. I eat healthily but still allow the odd treat. I'd never dear wear anything skin tight or fitted only baggy tops and jumpers and you'd never catch me in a bikini or swimsuit in public! I can't remember the last time I stood in front of my mirror and had positive body thoughts, I tend to avoid it when I'm in just my underwear or getting dressed.
I really worry about children these days and how much they are influenced by all of the things they have access to now. BUT having said that, seeing more real life, normal people on YouTube, will hopefully give a more balanced view of the world 🦄💙💚💛💜
I wish I had a ounce of your self appreciative confidence. I have two children and struggle daily with accepting myself. My husband hasn't seen me naked (bar childbirth and pitch black intimate moments!) since before I had my first child. I look at myself in the mirror and feel proud of birthing two children, but I also mourn how confident and happy I felt with my body before getting pregnant. I eat well, I keep fit, but I just cannot shake the lack of confidence, I don't know how. I hope one day I can, because it's soul destroying
Fab mum day gi on the whole my bod is ok but I will forever be mum belly with tiger stripes but wouldn't change it. Taken me 7 years and 2 kids to get here tho
I have never been pregnant and sadly I never will as I can't have children. But I totally relate to the feelings in this video. I am 38 and still trying to find how to be comfortable in my own skin plus size skin and cant bear to look in the mirror but i am working on it Thank you for your honesty. I love your videos. X
Struggling to see why this is on trending..? no critique of the vid just numbers.
Oh Gi! ❤️ I'm pregnant with twin girls due any day now. I've always been large ever since I gained weight when I was 15 y.o. (26 now) and my mum and my sis has always been nagging me to lose weight and be that thin again. Now with my pregnancy I've lost a lot of weight due to morning sickness and they've been on me to start weight watchers as soon as my girls are born - just so that I can keep that weight and drop further. It makes me so mad and sad. 😔😡
I too felt empowered throughout pregnancy and I now feel proud of those stretch marks post pregnancy! I was worried about what my body would look like after giving birth but I've never been this happy about my body. I view my stretch marks as a reminder of how empowered I felt during pregnancy and hope to never feel bad about my body again!
so honest and so truthful for so many people including myself. i'm not a mum but i love these videos!
Probably late to the discussion, but I am currently 20 and i started noticing stretch marks when i was around 15/16. They'd probably developed long before that, but that was the first time I'd properly paid attention to them. At the time, it didn't bother me, they were only on the inside of the thighs, who would see them? Around a year ago, they started getting really dark, like a dark purple kinda colour  (they used to be silver), and there were a lot more on my thighs, but also on my sides. I've always been really self conscious about my weight and I dress to hide it a lot of the time. You're videos and your book and just you in general are really helping me to be okay with my 'tiger stripes' and to know that you dont have to look like everyone else to be happy with who you are. You're so confident and honest and real and its a very nice and much needed break from all the perfect models on Instagram and on magazines❤xx
I thought we only got stretchmarks when pregnant and was horrified when I got the same thigh marks and more on my boobs in my childhood. I was so ashamed of them I wouldn't go the the beach or swim with my friends anymore. I'm still not confident having my legs out. Thank you for talking about this! <3
I'm much more confident with the way I look now compared to when I was a teen/early 20s. I was so unhealthily skinny (could see my ribs) and I hated the way I looked in comparison to more curvaceous friends! I've got more to me now and I'm much happier!
This was what I needed to hear today. Thank you for encouraging me. It was actually a few weeks ago I realized I was comparing my body to my 18 year old body. The one that didn't have the health issues I have now. My goal is to be healthy now. Whether that means I'm fat or not. Being healthy is key. <3
So happy you posted this today. I suffer with body dysmorphia and in my teens i hated my body. I was a size 8 and hated it. Everyone said i looked great and i couldn't see it. I sufffered with pcos and endometriosis along with other issues so i was hairy and my stomach would swell. I had my oldest at 19 and struggled with the weight gain to the point i was nearly hospitalised. But once she was born my worries seemed to get put in a box, it was like someone flicked a switch and i was happier with how i looked. Now im pregnant with baby no.4 and embracing the bump and womanly curves. I love my saggy pouch from my 2 cesareans and my scars from various needles and ops. I know that my body has made some amazing munchkins who tell me everyday how beautiful i am 💕
I seriously have a love hate relationship with my body. Some days I love it and think “you like great, you have had 2 kids - awesome!!” Then the next I see a large stomach and bits that wobble and stretch marks and it’s repulsive. I think us as women will never love ourselves completely because of media we see and these “celebs” who snap back and just have that “skinny gene” but we should be bloody proud of it...  (by the way massive fans of you and your family!) - Essex Mum too!
All women are beautiful
This is so inspirational !! ❤️
I have never been skinny and I hate the term fat - I prefer to call myself a plus size lady! I was bullied for my weight which didn't help - I comfort ate cause I thought it made me feel good. However I'm 24, still plus size but I am happy and healthy. I was always told you will never have a boyfriend if you are fat - but I was in a 2 year relationship with a guy who adored me and we would still be together but he unfortunately passed away. However, there is light at the end of the tunnel - I've been told by guys I'm there type - and I have a date on Wednesday! I will lose weight for me and not anyone else! Anyways who'd want to fit in - I prefer being unique xxx
Last year I wore with myself about my body image and how I felt which led to me writing on a friend’s blog about my hang ups and wobbly bits. The amount of people that wanted to talk to me and say “I feel the same way too” was incredible. Don’t worry! Everyone has bits they don’t like!!\n\n(P.s here’s the link to my post: http://www.verbalremedy.co.uk/no-interest-fat-friend/ )
couldn't agree more with everything you said. didn't feel great about my body early on in puberty (probably cause I was quite skinny as a child but developed early) but I've got used to it and yeah I do have moments where I wish I had a completely flat stomach but hey ho that's life 😊😊😊
Gi you are such an inspiration, thank you for talking so openly about subjects like this, and making everyone feel accepted and appreciate the fact that we are who we are. Xx
My story is similar to yours. I was never super confident in my body. High school was a mess for me, but I got past it. I then, after accepting my body for the most part was in an abusive relationship where the guy was so worried about me getting fat that he did extreme things to me to make me diet, excersize, etc. \nGot out of that after way to long and claimed ownership over my body again. Never again would a man dictate me like that.  \nI found a wonderful man who said he could care less what I weigh, and we married.\nI felt good about myself, not the skinniest ive ever been, perhaps the largest, but the most loved.\nMy relationship with my body hit rock bottom when I lost 3 babies in a row. How could I call myself a woman?  how could my husband love me when I couldn't give him his hearts desire? I am broken, i am undeserving, i am unlovable. It was awful, i stopped taking care of myself and unfortunately dont recognise myself in the mirror my shape has changed so much but I have had 2 kids now and a third is due in about 6 weeks. My body is amazing, even if most people just look at me and think, oh she's let herself go, I know the battles I have fought to get here and the demons I face. If im able to return to a slimmer state after this baby that would be amazing, if not, my husband still loves me and I have a beautiful family.
Thanx for this video. I was always the really skinny girl, who never put weight on when i younger. I’m now 35 with 4 children ages from 4 to 18 (almost). As u can imagine I no longer have the flat stomach that I had before. Try in vain to exercise.. and feel guilty if I don’t.. \nI definitely need to except myself now, n stop looking at everyone else for how I should look. Thank you for this xx
I've never looked after my body, and have an unhealthy relationship with food. Now I'm two years into TTC and my thinking is beginning to shift. I feel guilty for being so unhealthy but, still, I feel overwhelmed at the task ahead - the task of making real changes.
Ohh how i needed this today! I suffer with endometriosis, i was diagnosed at 13, now 19. The amount of hormones ive been on is quite scary, going through medically induced menopause, 3 major operations really does take its toll on your body! Thank you Gi for making me realise that despite the fact my body lets me down I should still love and embrace it💛💛 thank you!
Love this! Thank you so much! Have had a lot of 'meh' days since the birth of my second boy a year ago (still can't lose the last of the weight!) But it's so true, my body gave me my 2 boys and am so grateful!
Love you even more this video is so special
Thank you for this video Gi, I know you won't read this but I have to say. Been to drs to see my diabetic nurse and i felt like crap. I'm never going to be a mum I've embraced this now.  \nThank you for being you xxx
What a great message, Gi!  I've always struggled with weight and have never been satisfied with my body.  I developed at a young age and have never liked my big boobs.  I found gaining a little weight helped camouflage them.  After my first son, I was so large that I went to weight watchers to help lose the extra weight and felt so much better.  I weighed less at 9 months pregnant with my younger son.  Over the years I've lost and gained back the same weight that I no longer worry about it (well, as much anyway!).  At this stage of my life, I just want to be heart healthy and able to get around easily.  It's sad how society and ads makes you feel like you're inadequate.  I'm just shy of 5 feet and my natural body type is definitely not like a stick thin model.  You're so right that we should accept and embrace who we are and not compare ourselves to others.
I never liked my figure, but am currently pregnant with my third baby and am suffering with hyperemesis. I have lost nearly 2 stone in weight in the space of a couple of months and am the skinniest i have ever been. I feel awful! I look awful and i will never ever strive to be thin or have the 'perfect' figure again!
Lots of love Gi xxx
I was diagnosed with PCOS at 15 (I'm now 36) and have always had fluctuating weight and consequently low body confidence. Things got worse however, when I was trying to conceive and tried various treatments including clomid. 7 years later I had icsi/IVF and fortunately my daughter came along. Since having her almost 7 years ago I have really struggled to lose weight. I have always exercised regularly and really enjoy it but I can't seem to get to a size that I'm completely comfortable with. I have a trainer and he works me really hard and I feel physically fit but the appearance of my body is unbearable. I'm super proud that after all the years of feeling that my body was fighting me to get pregnant that I carried a child, but in terms of body confidence I don't have any. I avoid looking in mirrors, I don't accept compliments from my husband when he says I look nice etc and this can really upset my husband but I cannot help it. I totally relate to many of the things you say in this video and hope that one day I can reach the point where I'm confident and happy with how my body looks.
Hi Gi! My body lets me down time and time again. I have had Crohns disease since I was 11 (now 35) and multiple ops have left me scarred and with a stoma bag so body image is important to me.  I've embraced how I look because you only get one shot at life.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder! Love yourself and be loved x
I hate my body I cover up as much as I can,there is not one part I like.I've recently put on a lot of weight that I can't seem to shift,but as I was anorexic for quite some years I'm trying my best not to let that mind set take over I hope one day I will like my body but it's very hard not to feel judged by people for putting on weight or losing to much weight I hope one day that I won't be influenced by people's views on the way I look 😊
Especially post pregnancy (I have not had any children) there's this enormous pressure to force yourself to shrink yourself before you leave the hospital. I think it's important to know we are meant to be different sizes I'm not meant to be a size 2. As long as you're healthy that's the most important thing
Thanks for the video Gi. So many women feel the pressure to be skinny. Over the years I've put on weight and I'm okay with that. The media drive me insane with the articles about mums who get back into there skinny jeans weeks after birth, it's putting to much pressure on new mums. We all have different bony shapes so it should not matter weather someone is a size 8  or an 18! Your a star gi, and we need mums like you to tell the truth and speak out. You look great and your a Fab mum to.
Hi Gi this video came at a good time for me! Didn't realise I needed to hear what you said but it soothed me to know everyone is struggling in the same ways I do! I was diagnosed at 13 with pcos and have had a 21 year fight with this, I unfortunately have struggled a long time with the inability to fall pregnant and it still isn't happening and it breaks my heart every month. I've tried metformin and it didn't agree with me sadly. I still hope that I will be blessed but I am trying to make my peace with the fact it may never happen. After a big scare earlier this year of finding I had a condition that could develop into cervical cancer I've had to have a coil fitted and I hate that little piece of plastic so much, to me it spells game over for the baby dream! The body I have been given may not work how it should with all the other health problems I have but it's mine and I love it, I am the heaviest weight I have ever been but I eat well don't exercise as much as I should but I'm active and I'm listening to what it's telling me for the first time in all my 34 years with it. Thank you for being you and promoting self love ❤️ you Gi are a wonderful human xxxx
I've felt bad about my body since I was way too young. I used to be really open and a happy kid, and I loved funky clothes. One day I was wearing a crop top and an older boy said: you're way too fat to wear that. From that comment on, my self image changed so much. I always worried how I would look in certain clothes and compared myself to others in a negative way. The silly thing is that when I started a diet, lost a lot of weight and was considered 'skinny', I still felt horrible. It's not so much the weight, it's the mental scars that keep nagging. Bloody annoying!
I remember a few years ago I felt so fat and disgusting and it really got me down and I look at pictures now from that time and can't believe I ever complained about it.
Well said Gi! :)\nOne thing that annoys me though is when people moan about their bodies on social media or say that they need to go on a diet when they don't. My sister ( who's only one year younger than me, 23) does it a lot and it really worries me. I recommended Megan Jayne Crabbe's book on body positivity to her as it really helped me but she just laughed and threw it back in my face :(
THANK U FOR THIS
I'm on a diet with my husband right now.. I say diet but actually we starting eating healthier and loosing weight. It is so much easier when we do it together! I lost 6 kilos but still not happy. I think I'll never be happy with my body cause I keep comparing myself to others and think that I'm not thin enough. You are an inspiration to us all! love your videos xxxx
I am currently 35 weeks pregnant and am sick off people saying woo your huge or well so and sos bump is much bigger than your I feel like I should smile but really I want to say who cares my body is grown my baby keeping him safe I absolutely adore you G!
Oh Gi. Thank you for sharing this!\nEverything you said is actually what/how i feel about my body!\nAfter having two miscarriages and having tree boy's xx\nSo happy your back
Aw Gi I love this you're being so honest! Most of us can relate to this, you are beautiful! We all are! :)
My highest weight was 285lbs and my main goal was to get under 200 and I did! It took about 3 years and I got down to 193! My final goal was (still is) 160 but I found out I was pregnant when I was at 193. I am now 36 weeks pregnant and I must say, going above 200 again was really hard and it made me sad. My husband has been amazing and keeps telling me how beautiful I am and I know it'll be worth it because I'm gonna have a beautiful baby girl. My body will never be the same and I accept that. I mean, I'm growing a tiny human inside of me! Isn't it amazing?! You are an inspiration for so many people Gi. We all love you <3
I really love the honesty here. I wish I could go back and love myself and my body as a teenager - not only was I fitter and healthier than I am now but I spent so much time and energy hating myself and it's not a healthy way to be. When I had to be signed off with depression 2 years ago I spent a lot time hating myself and really turning my feelings in on myself, to the point where I delayed my recovery as I couldn't even like myself, including my body. Punishing it with excessive amounts of food or starving it were not healthy. Then I discovered running, and although it's a challenge, I like my body more now. It's strong and it can do so much more than I ever thought it could. And I think being in love has made me see myself the way he sees me, which is incredible.
❤️
Thank you for sharing, Gi 💕
Thank you for sharing this Gi ❤️ since having my little boy (he's two now) I've really struggled with my body - confidence has been at all time lows more than it has been positives! Although it's taken me this long, I'm finally embracing my body and self care is so important. Not every day do I feel like that, and inspiring people like you make me realise that it's ok to feel like that. So thank you 😘😘 Katy xxx
So weird! I decided to go for a run today, first one since having my baby so that's 9 months of pregnancy + her 18months! Didn't manage very far but felt so good afterwards, it's time to start taking care of my body for my sake and for my daughter! Thanks for the boost Gi! x
I've been really up and down with how I've  felt about my body.  I have always been on the heavier side, ever since I was a kid.  When I got to college I really let my eating get out of control and I got to be really heavy and unhealthy.  But then last year I began exercising regularly and eating better than I had in my entire life!  I felt great and thought I could accomplish anything!  I lost a good amount of weight, but still hadn't reached my goal. Recently, however, I've felt that my impulse control has gone and I've gained back some of the weight that I had lost and I've started eating junk again, and I don't know if I'll be able to be as healthy as I was before.  Hopefully I can get resume the healthier habits that I had before, and I can be happy and healthy again.
Awesome video.  Thank you for always being so honest.
Thank you, thank you, thank you x
I was having a meh day too. This video has made me feel so much better ❤
It’s so nice to hear you talk about pcos. I found out 6/7 years ago that I had it at the same time of trying for our first child. After over a year of trying I finally had our first son and couple of years later our second son. They are truly my little miracles. Since having them my body and pcos has really become a massive struggle. I get so angry with it but it’s made me the person I am today and I’m stronger for it.
You are bloody amazing ❤️
You are amazing, Gi!
Beauty lies within
Bloody love this woman!
Yes Gi!! :) xx
Hi Gi would you ever do a video about PCOS? Things such as how it effects you and what medications you take to help with your symptoms? Not just conception and pregnancy (that too obviously) but your journey with PCOS in general like the excess hair, spots, weight gain, mood swings etc, and what things help with each? I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 18 (I'm now 30) and am always on the look out for other ways to cope.
I've lost 13st over the last 18 months and I feel wonderful, ok I'm not going to be toned but I'm so happy 😊 😊 😊 😊 great video xxx
I have two sisters and grew up being the chubby, short one. My lovely nickname was Fatty Arbuckle! it was meant to be endearing???? My body confidence came when I had my first little lady. Of course, I have a few bad moments on occasion, but there's something kind of magical about having children, being in a team with your body and seeing how amazing it is, rather than being at war with it. Thank you for sharing your stories. xxx
I look back at photos of me from about the age of 15 onwards, I was so slim and attractive but I felt like a great, big elephant. One thing that I wish I could do, is go back and tell the young me to be proud of her body and to accept that she is gorgeous. All my life I have avoided wearing dresses and skirts because I have 'rugby player's legs' but I'm 45 now and have realised that they are the only pair of legs that I'm going to get so now have a wardrobe full of lovely dresses and skirts that I wear. If people don't like my legs, they don't have to look!
lol wth is this and why's it trending
What you said at the end about not swapping your size 8/10 body for Buzz and Buddy really struck me! I'm 12 weeks pregnant and really fluctuate between feeling great and proud of my changing body but then last night a pair of my pjs were too tight around my tummy and it just crushed me because I don't really have a proper bump yet. I had this big hormonal discussion with my husband while he tried to convince me that what my body does is amazing and that he loves the way I look as I'm changing but I just felt really sorry for myself that I was going to lose my 8/10 figure that I've only had for a few years but you're right I want this baby more than anything and that's just going to have to include my figure - so thank you very much! A well timed video for me haha
Wow. This was so honest and real. I've never related to something as much as I relate to this video and your story. Actually, I've never been pregnant and I always worried about how my body would be after I had kids... Thank you for this message and for sharing your story. Xx
Gi - I found out I had PCOS when I was 16 getting my first birth control and I was so crushed for awhile. I'm 19 now and I still worry about it sometimes. Thank you for opening up about this, it means so much. <3 x
I recently just saw a photo of me at 20 years old, and when I used to see it, I would wish I were that skinny again. But then I remember how that was one of the most stressful years of my life. And some people, when stressed, gain weight. Not me. I STARVE. I literally forget to eat, and I was going to nearly four days without sleep and only coffee for nourishment. Now I look at that photo and think that I never want to be that unhealthy or that weak.\n\nI'm much bigger and heavier than I was then, but I'm also far stronger (I started doing aerial arts a few years ago; it's been incredible). Though I still have days where I really notice my soft tummy, or my thunder thighs, and just not contented with how I look.\n\nIt hasn't helped that in Filipino culture, we have this awful kind of tradition of greeting each other with Uy tumaba ka! (Hey, you've gotten fat!), especially during family reunions by overly nosy aunts. They use a tone that's supposed to be well-meaning, but actually just feels really degrading. And it does things to your confidence. Even when I was dancing ballet, and wasn't at all overweight, but I get a little heavy, and suddenly people react as if I've grown so much.
“Good God almighty, good God almighty, that killed him…as God as my witness he is broken in half”
Did that look fake to anyone else
it's fake, now back to my porno because that's real
It looks like he hurt his lower back during that takedown and his opponent notices it and be like fck it Im Doing the Walls of Jericho Maaaaannnnnn!
Looked scripted to the fuck..
Fake as fuck
It's fully legit and it would break you in half . It's all about posting luck we're you end up out of a scramble. This is a rare finish to get the two legs
Punches were half hearted. Reactions to them were too strong.
Fucking easy. I always do this to my sister. Lol
Looks 100 percent fake.  I've been rolling for over 10 years and NEVER seen anyone lay there while a guy fumbles with his legs, or roll stomach down from love taps.   Troll.  That was the SLOWEST leg grab / clumsy as hell transition that I've ever seen.
MMA fans are the most retarded fans in all of sports. Everything is fake except mma 😂
Next please God let someone win a mma match with a RKO or a Stone Cold STUNNER
Get the fuck outta here lol
mma will neeeeeeveer \neeeeeeeever be the same again!
I wonder how many of the fake comments are because thoughts of it not being possible or thoughts of OMG WWE FAKE AND GAY!
Fake as fuck.\nThat dude got a pillow punch to the face @:28 and turtled up his face leaving his legs limp for 3 seconds as if he was asleep.\nI call bs
FAKE
He helped him by ajusting his leg lmfao. Fake as fuck
i thought you couldnt attack the spine and small joints?
Is it me or does the screaming dude slick sound like Paul hey man for a second
you know what happens when you use the walls of jericho without jerichos permission ?\nyou know what happens !!
some moves are in the WWE are effective in real life combat situation
Ya wtf, did Michael Bolton make the finish here or what?  And how the fuck is it a Walls of Jericho when he just stole that move, originally called the Boston Crab
I do this to the misses when she ain't givin it!!!
Clearly fake. If it was real they would be continuously ringing the bell while he nods his head to apply more pressure.
Walls of Jericho? That move is older than WWE... If only they watched good old Lucha Llibre........
That was some seriously fake shit right there.  Anyone who actually believes that was not a work, I have some prime real estate on the moon to sell you. Dirt cheap.
Dude that lost looks like he's never seen any type of grappling before. \n\nEither he was that bad and unskilled or this is fake as fuck.
It's not fake. Allegedly he slipped a disc in his spine on that dlt so you can only imagine the effect of contorting his legs and lower bavk
lion tamer is much better than the walls
That actually does work.. it seems like he got it to easy but that shit actually hurts enough to get someone to tap... you back can only bridge so far and the more he goes the more pressure on your chest... bushing up only hurts your back more...its hard to explain you must experience it to know what i mean.
If you ever been on this submission you will know that this move makes it hard for people to breathe when in this position
I need to do this when i fight someone
Fixed, Zangief from street fighter was trying to get into the move before it was being done on him...
It's not Boston Crab, it's just crap
Where are the other fights ?
This looked fake as hell, dude was making zero effort to get up at 0:30, just let it happen.
The way the guy was making weird faces the whole time, and just laying there like a fish out of the water... Looks fake, still fun submission tho
here is a vid I did years ago on half-crab, and a half crab was ACTUALLY legit done in Indian MMA a few years back fyi https://youtu.be/fA1NxkhnYdM
Boy was that set up. No way in hell a pro fighter would let anyman sit on his back and slowly grab both of his legs smh. When i saw this i thought there was going to be some crazy set up to get the sub but that was just one guy allowing the other guy to do it wtf is that bs
Guy hurt his back and was winded by the fall, this wouldn't have worked if his opponent was not in a weakened state.
That guys back looked broken from the takedown. Why would you even MMA if you can get beat with THAT pro wrestling move.  Tough way to make a buck
I had the Bolton Crabs ! strange really ? As the Crab had a shaved pussy ?
He knew what he was doing all along, you can tell he had already planned it
imagine if it was the lion tamer
guy hurt himself on the takedown, thats why he could get it
Really looks fake wtf! Why would anyone agree to being embarrassed like that
And your new WWE champion is......
He tapped only because he hurt his back, You can see him grimacing from pain after the takedown.
fake nothing else to say
You just made the list !
That was an insult to anyone with eyes.
Aaron Jones looked hurt after the takedown, then took a good shot to the right eye and went defensive belly down, he was hurt and in cover mode so the boston crab was easy to setup. I think this is legit. You watch too much UFC and you forget there are some pretty bad fighters out there who can get caught by something like this
Oh my that's so fake. Please don't destroy the reputation of mma with these fake fighters
BREAK THE WALLS DOWN
Break the walls down
LOL he gave him his right leg.. all he had to do is extend his right leg, get on his right hip and shake his left leg. i cant believe people are falling for this fake bullshit
пипец, реслинг теперь в клетке устраивают?))
B. e. a. utiful
You do realize when applied properly, a boston crab will get you a submission...I've done it; just sayin'.
it's bullshit crab
Fake a planned
pmsl nice
Amazing finish!
🎶 You can't wrestle, tan tan tan tan tan 🎶
what a joker
fake and gay
0.27 that fake punch lol
WTF, 100% fake, no way!!!
That looked so homoerotic
Ha
NOT FAKE
Looks faker than WWE.
Fake as shit
looks scripted
jajajajajajaj que malos tio
FAKE
WWE FAN HERE
OMG J.R ITS THE WALLLLSSSS!
Fucking UFC Creative buried him
Fake.
WWE
Faker than WWE
About as real as a leprechaun flying a unicorn
BOSTON crab. Not Bolton.
CAN WE GET A STONE COLD STUNNER NEXT WEEK.
Alright, Now if they can pull off a Figure-Four or a Sharpshooter, then maybe I’ll watch an MMA match.
The fact that they called it before he even grabbed both legs makes it look hella fake. Not gonna judge tho.
Back in 199X it use to be Boston crab now it's Bolton who?
That looks set up  and definitely not walls of Jericho
It's not the walls of Jericho.  Jericho puts a knee in ur back
That punch was so fake before the SHARP SHOOTER.
Jonno gets style points for sticking the tongue out
scripted better than EastEnders
*BOSTON CRAB
I was literally thinking the other day that I'm surprised a figure 4 leg lock hasn't been done in UFC yet as it's pretty easy to do and extremely effective
That was a pure set up .Pure theaterised shite. Mma fans of purity will have seen tight through that one 👎
Dana White's Lookin For A Fight...... won't be lookin here!
Probably fake but still that move hurts like fuck, anybody with older siblings who are WWE fans will relate all too well
That gay gave that to him
Was immediately reminded of this scene when I heard Tom Petty passed away. Rest in peace, man.
RIP Master Tom Petty! thanks for everything.
fly high tom petty
RIP Tom Petty
Rip tom petty ;(...
Why is one of my favourite songs associated with a character who looks as though he d sing this just after he'd got a terminally ill pensioner to sign over their last will and testament to him.I like Tom Cruise but does this character really have the morals we re meant to think he has
This clip picked up 100+ likes in a day. RIP Tom Petty. Legend
Hahaha his face when he's trying to find the right song
0:31 RIP Tom Petty
Best scene ever. RIP Tom Petty...
R.I.P. Tom Petty ~
Das könnte auch Ich im Auto sein. CD von Petty im Kasten und dann: Freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Falling......:-)
Freaking midget
Tom Cruise singing before it was cool. Makes me wonder if the people behind Rock of Ages saw this and thought, Let's have him play Stacee Jaxx! Love both movies btw.
My LOVE!
free fallin'💔
One of all time favourite scenes ever since I was a kid! Great film, and one of Tom's finest performances. 
he is still the best lookin guy ever
one of the best actors everrrrrrrrrr... and so kind to his fans... I admire him very much
Cameron Crowe knows how to put together a great soundtrack...
This song is 'free falling' of the Tom Petty!
Absolutely amazing scene!!! I love you Tom ;)
Love you Tom!!!!! 😍😍😍😍
Can anybody tell me who's song is this?\n
I´ve seen girls driving the car screaming at the top of their voices ... isn´t it a bit of a paradox??
Omg❤️❤️❤️❤️
okay I'm really shocked that tom cruise can sing 
er liebt Klasse Musik, deswegen ist sein Sohn Connor auch DJ, der darf machen was er will. Vor wegen Scientology schreibt alles vor,Blödsinn, da gibt es Freiheiten und das muss zum Erfolg führen, hilf dir selber andere tun es nicht
guys! been getting f ree gift cards everyday from here ➜ lythu.com/giftcardsgiveaway?80940493
Bruce Willis and Chris Martin's love child playing the other banjo?
bluegrass rules.
!!! CAROLINE !!!\nI've been singing this song for a week now!\nThanks for sharing!\nBlessings~
My respect for Steve Martin and the Steep Canyon Rangers has space rocket right now !!!
WOW! Let's officially classify these guys as National Treasures!!
Hot damn!!! Steve Martin can play the hell out of the Banjo! Much impressed by him and the band!
he can really pick a mean banjer
Wow Steve Martin is a Beast on a Banjo!
Not gonna lie, Caroline put a tear in my eye. Well done.
Perfect start to my day, what music is all about.
The sense of humor here reminds me of when Lyle Lovett came on.  Really folksy, charming, and adorable. <3
Man it almost has a DOORSy vibe to it
So cool. Just watched Big Year last night.
Is that the dude from Guy on a Buffalo playing bass ? On a serious note, never really listened to bluegrass before but that was very impressive!
Great new album
Fashizzle.
It's he the actors from the movie with 12 kids?
The music is so soulful each and everyone of you is an amazing artist.  Steve you are the only true bond artist. Cheers!
Multi talented!
Please do Old Crow Medicine Show !!
The older I get the more I like banjo music.
I have known that Steve Martin has played banjo for about a decade.  After seeing this performance, I think I have re-written the data in my brain to associate Steve with banjo playing first then comedy second.  I will also say that he has aged very gracefully.
holy shit... i wasn't expecting that... that was killer!
Thanks to the sound engineer for a perfect recording for these fabulous players and Steve too.
Hey Steve, you’re a ramblin guy.  I, too, wish to someday be a ramblin guy.
Shithead would be proud.
go steve, great pickin
I could actually feel his gaze of approval at 1:06
Bluegrass always makes me smile. Thank you.
He's so good at music...... he should try acting
please like this video for win the competition https://youtu.be/VOfkATP7Z8M
Rupret on banjo
Dana carvey on violin
shredding.
Love Martin
Snarky puppy!
Gotta love that Collins guitar
This is really good.
I look very much like Steve Martin and am his exact age. But he got all the talent and ambition. Dammit! But I admire the guy.
Beautiful music!! ❤️❤️❤️
NPR Music please invite Łąki Łan!
Fantastic, Loved it👍🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸
Thank you. Great stuff.
banjo master
Bruce Willis on banjo #2 ;)
Awesome banjo.
wut?
He hates those cans!
Love it!!!!
Steve Martin lookin like Pappy O'danielYa dad blamed idjit
Surprenante découverte... Bravo Mister Martin!...
Dana Carvey sure plays a mean fiddle...🤣
Holy smokes what a gem to have! This recording will be a big part of history. His enthusiasm for this music style will continue to enspire many.
Is the guy in the floral shirt the most uncomfortable man in 2017?   He looks like he snuck into the band and is paranoid as fook
Who knew. Sweet.
Needs more white guys hovering behind Steve. Great music though!
He  plays so well and so effortlessly. Truly  a master of many talents. The whole band is good as well.
I remember the arrow through the head hat he used to wear
Read the title and insta liked this is amazing ty NPR!!!
Why's there only seven? I heard they're CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN!!
This just made my day. Thank you, NPR!
That's a lot of talent for one person to have. I seriously dig this music.
He used a banjo to get his start.  He did a comedic stand-up act with his banjo, and appeared on the Sonny and Cher show - that's how he first got wide exposure.  He would put a fake arrow on his head and play his banjo.  It might be on youtube somewhere.
Top notch musicians, as always. Made it 6 minutes listening to banjos. Along with most accordions, banjos are always out of tune. ALLLLLwaaays outta tune. A single banjo note is out of tune with itself. Is like all the nails and all the chalkboards in the world...
Just 1 reason so many people love Steve Martin plus all his hilarious antics. I read somewhere, he has been playing a banjo since before he joyfully entertained us on TV.
When you realize this is actually STEVE MARTIN! WOW 💚
Somebody give Josh Rogosin a raise!
Wow always loved Steve Martin and never knew he was a musican!! 🙌
The first doesn't really sound like So familiar. Is it really? Or did they make a mistake, cause i would really like to find it. Would the kind folk of youtube comment's section be so kind tell me? Please?
I see a show-off french speaking guy, I upvote
This is so cool
steve martin plays the banjo???!!!!! 😍😍😍😍
GET FRANK OCEAN ON THIS NPR PLEASW
Steve Martin reminds me of my talented funny uncle I loved! 😄 till my uncle fingered my bum in my sleep😕
Doc Watson .... would be smilin' ... Nice stuff boys! Mr. Martin Bravo!
He is Soooo talented.  They sound great. Thanks for sharing this with us.
I feel like this music would fit perfectly in the Firefly universe
Love Steve Martin, and loved this NPR Tiny Desk Concert!!! Now when can I see this live??!
Dam Steve I had no idea
Lol after listen to this i want to marry my sister
His face seems unnaturally smooth. Did he got plastic surgery at some point?
Wow Steve is a natural👍👏🎶🎸 btw the whole group flows so well together. I love when people have more than one creative ability, keeps you out of other peoples business! 😆😁
Damn this is so cool!
This band is so amazing, they even have a turtle singing for them
No idea Steve was such an awesome musician. So pleasantly surprised!
Steve Martin, I started on a five-string banjo like yours, but I have changed to a 10-string banjo. Much better sound. Why don't you give it a try?
Planes trains and banjos
So that the moron can play. ROFL so hard. Did not expect that punch line.
Steve Martin is brilliant, funny and an incredible musician. Of course he surrounds himself with other master musicians!❤️❤️❤️
What is this? What am I feeling?
Whether you like bluegrass music or not, you have to respect all of the talent, finesse, and timing that these musicians  master.
He should do  a song with Punch Brothers
He is considered #5 best banjo player in the WORLD. Love the SCR Band. Long time from SNL host and the Smothers Brothers writer.
I love my dad, but also wish that Steve Martin was my dad.
John C. Reilly and friends was awesome too
So much happening, I can barely catch up! The beautiful instruments, the mellow singing, the amazing audio engineering, perfect jokes, impressive musicians. Loved everything about it!
I'm wondering if Mr. Martin planned this to be the be white-boy brigade or, as I'm praying, it's just a sad irony that all these instruments collected from various cultures around the world are now the sad reminders of the beautiful friends we lost so long ago.  Or have we lost them when they live so vibrantly within us...I don't know...I guess I am just wishing I had a bada**  fro and an Aztec tan...but I guess I'm just be the blond haired, blue eyed joke of blending of all of {US}.   I like to think that there are blond-haired, blue-eyed Native Americans...I feel like a Native American, can't I just proclaim it.....I'd like to think I could some kind of redemption to all those have lost their favorite version of America(I hope America is read as North America, South America, and Central America.)   .
NPR is normally state-propaganda, so this was refreshing!   I do love bluegrass.   \n\nThe lack of hill-melancholy and marcato give it away as city-playing; but refreshing nonetheless.   Thank you SCR band.
I just started a channel could you guys subscribe and view my video 😀
Love you Blake 😘😘😍😍
those EYES,  ARE.  BRIGHT DEEP.  AND CLEAR,   NOTHING HIDDEN IN THIS SOUL.  HOPE IS A SEED PLANTED WATERED AND GIVEN PLENTY OF SUN.   THEN HOPE TURNS TOO FAITH, NOW THE SEED MUST TURN BACK IN TO THE SOUL, AND BECOME ROOTED, ONCE THAT HAPPENS, FAITH, HAS TURNED  INTO AN ACTION WORD,  SEEIN AS THOU IT IS FINIISHED.    GROWS BIG DEEP AND STRONG.   GROUNDED FOR ETERNITY. CONSTANT.
I really appreciate this song. When I heard it for the first time it made me laugh and cry! It is sweet and romantic and feels like family! Thank You for going Traditional It is wonderful!

Love you Blake 😘😘😍😍
❤️ Blake Shelton
I love this song so much❤️
Blake did you ever live in Wichita Falls Texas and have an uncle named Glenn Shelton that work for the Wichita Falls Times news
You should think about what you told your fans I quote you “Suck it” now for you we the fans helped you in many ways. By buying your music then the things you were going through during your divorce. Now you Suck it. I would never buy another item of yours you owe your fans an apology bottom line.
I absolutely LOVE this song! Not to mention A LOT of your songs Blake! Faithful fan here! Your music never ceases to amaze me!
Who wrote the song? The concept is brilliant!\n#countrymusic
Name the dog Blake.
The comments on this vid are beyond retarded.
ha ha sucker, an act of god that was  🤣🤣🤣
So guns do kill people after all.
hope no one died XD
Looks like he got his Gunn
lmao Jesus is coming for your wig manson 😂😂
too funny. hope he is doing ok ;)
Could have been worse. He could have been at a gig in Las Vegas!
Crushed by a giant cross? Ohhh, so there IS a god AND he has a sense of humor
when it hit him he bend over so far he could lick his own ass lol
Who's the jerk fan who screams to finish the f****** song at minute 2:45?
Anne Lennox did it better, come on
Wow they weren't even playing the instruments.
Who cares he's a fuckin freak
I bet he broke a few ribs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh wait.
Couldn't have happened to a better 'man' 😂😂😂😂😂😂
it fell on the beat drop
I can't be fucked this crowd is boring.. Cut the strings and let the prop fall on me...
2:04 is what you came for
2:47 is when some guy shouted finish the fucking song
MOST LIKELY this happened because he has been ripping a bibles onstage...
I don't wish injury to anyone but honestly, I didn't know he was still performing.  I thought he retired.
Hes ok, remember kids he had his ribs removed so he can succ his own dicc. he simply folded in half until the prop was removed off him. no damage done. thank god.
Hes gotten so fat his gravitational pull was bound to fuck him up
Lol, a bit of a Spinal Tap moment. Act of God for being a degenerate !
People Cheering like it's part of the show
Rip pages out of the Word of God and you’ll get what you deserve.
did they pay to get in? to listen to covers?
I love you. Get well soon 🖤
he can't get enough horror this bloke....lol
I believe this was... Staged.
Let's just pray he crushed his vocals
They're jammin' out at hammerstein,\nHe climbed a ladder then got pinned,\nStupidest stunt in mankind,\nThe ballroom prop.
Was that paul from the wonder years?
He’s always brought the house down 😂
Am I the only one in the comment section who is concerned if he is actually alright???
Manson recuperate pronto! Master Lord Satan is with you!😆👍🎶
The guitar guys like 'that things fallen on him, shows over - yeah we're done'...

I live in Las Vegas and unfortunately my Friends, my gf, and I were involved in the tragedy that occurred on Sunday. I have been glued to the news , I've been proactive and trying to help serve my community and be there for other victims and today I hit an extreme low. Everything began to sit in and I finally broke down making it only the second time I have cried. I hurt for my friends , I hurt for my community and I just hurt all over. YouTube , and your videos have always been a place of solace and today it has brought me comfort and an occasional smile and laugh. There were many heroes that night, my gf included and today you are my hero for putting a smile on my face. Thank you bunny from the bottom of my heart.
would have liked to have seen more of what they sold .. we dont have shops like this in the uk :'(
OMG my Halloween stores golf store to
Your videos are amazing <3
16:26 omg im done! XD same

Why is she getting stressed out and complaing about prices? 8 million subs. Im pretty sure she makes like THAT much a year or more. Definitely 7 or 8 figures.
On your so great
Saw at 16:05 😵😵😵😳the only truly terrifying movie😫😫😫
A lot of Hugh Hefner this year!

Omg you make me laugh so much! We need to be friends in real life haha let's make this happen!!
I'll be part of your squad bunny
Her eyes are so blue
I seen you at academy about 2 or 3 years ago but didn't want to walk up to you because I didn't want to disturb you... I regret it all the time. I love you
*You complete the game by winning*
The captions make this about 200% better
what console this on
I feel personally attacked by this video... Come on I'm not that evil
Holy freaking crap this video is the PSL to my soul
0:01 that damn eyebrow lift... hell it even goes with the flow of the damn note
I just want a super long version of the ending song.
I beat Greg but my game crashed
2:16-2:21 When you did the whole group assignment by yourself
This is just as good as the first one! Amazing!
the water level joke always makes me laugh my ass off. its the face he makes.
I really wanna play this game..
That fire theme gave me life
u are my favorite person in the world thanks
I'm sorry, but you're so awesome, talented, funny and sooo handsooommmmeeeeee
How about adding this to Spotify and iTunes? And the first one of course. Maybe everything else.
that was absolutely beautiful
lets start a kickstarter to finally get him a synth stand
I need a full version of Greg's theme, please
SECRET TIP : You start the game by starting
spot on, as always. lol gj man
I aspire to achieve that boss ass scowl.
The end is like having a group project and you did all the shit and give yourself credit
Very underated talent right there. You can be proud of being able to say : Yes, ive created a new way of humor.\nYoure a genius in  video productions\nGood Job dude and dunno what to say , youre awesome
Guess I enjoy being moist because I love water stages.
i see you like arcade games mate i grew with them and still play them and these are fucking spot on
change your channel name to\none piano man
Sounds great. When is it out?
no his name is not fucking greg
Freaking love Fire theme, do song in that key:D
Is this a dream? Two videos during one month. What did I do to deserve this? Just happy... I'm crying ...
Thought the shirt spelled ANUS for a moment..
Seth you should like make a full version of the race mini game segment
Pls monetize ur vids do you can hopefully do this full time!!! I need more of your vidsss!!!
What music do u actually listen to? I know it’s Coldplay sometimes!
Completes earth level: oh snap, is someone calling me? 
This dude’s eyebrows have more personality than I do
Full version of greg fight plz
Why do you have so many N64 Controllers? I'm not complaining...\n\nJust wondering...
if you win the air level in less that 5minutes you can destroy the big tree thats in the end of the earth level, when you do that you will hear a loud noise, similar to a volcano erupting, then you have to speedrun the water level (for fucks sake fuck the devs) because that will allow you to enter the volcano in the fire level, unlocking the ultra hard AETHER level, when you win it you have to defeat greg and rescue the princess, wait for the credits to end and you will start another boss fight where the princess transform into the final boss, defeat her and you get the true ending where you become the Lord of the Elements.\n\n\nim on acid.
Haha, my browser crashed on the Game Crashed scene.
You're flying or some shit  xDDD
Fire level is so good🔥💯👌
Catchiest goddamn menu theme I ever heard for a game that doesn't exist. Well done.
Plz make full song of fire level song
This video is the perfect combo for laughing no matter if you stare watching his face or simply hearing the music, hahaha, awesome job!
New Game\nSettings\nInstructions\nDog\nHelp\n\n...what does dog do?
second boss phase made my pants turn into titanium
the fire level one is so accurate what
The fire level is so much like the sun/moon temple from dark cloud xD
I'd buy a 54 minutes version of this just to be honest. $2.99 to $4.99 would be enough.
OMG THAT BOSS MUSIC THO, OMGGGGGGGG  ;0;  I need it to be an actual song  //ugly cry//  ToT
I need a DVD titled SethEverman for the Soul with all of his wonderful, wonderful content.
The fire level was great!!
i keep replaying the fire theme
Cuphead music theme??\nEDIT:I also thought that your hoodie says Anus.
I want a loop of the racing mini game music. That was lit.
When do we get full releases of the element level songs?
the fire level theme is a bop
m8 that face throughout it all XD
i still wanna know what dog does
I was sad and now im a lil less sad
Do a full version of that fire theme, it's so good
Please make this into an album

Am I the only one that thinks the guy getting tatted is sooo cute and needs to be more of him lol
1:06 if she said that to me
Am I a Margot Robbie fan, well... I don't think that's the right word.
What is reece doing there?.. she doesnt belong there and its funny cus she has an oscar.
The look in Harrison Fords eyes haha, he was like give me a bottle of whiskey now you crazy bastards\n!
Who else looked at the still and wondered where her arms had gone?!
I'd let her tattoo my tip
Everything is so awkward about this video....
Blake Lively and this girl would be the perfect 3 some
Harrison Ford is one of the strangest yet most fascinating people to watch in an interview. So deadpan, but god we love him! <3<3<3
Wtf Reese Witherspoon looks the same  she did before I was born.
Margot seems really lovely and genuine.
Margot Robbie touched my foot, epic fap to end all faps ensues. Never washes foot again. Dies from infection, doesn't care cause Margot Robbie
He can now say I got a tow tattoo from Margot Robbie
Reese seems thrilled to be there.
I’d get it
I can neaten it off when we are backstage. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
He could cut that toe off, preserve it in formaldehyde and sell it for *thousands*
i love of let margot tattoo my bolix not my foot....
Reese witherspoon is so jealous margot is getting the attention

Hey guys I am doing a dissertation about lecturers using lecture capture. (recording their own lectures and posting them on university website) please please can you answer the questions, it will only take 2 mins and 7 short questions https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/NNQVYCH
Harrison ford just wants to go smoke weed
THIS IS WHY GRAHAM NORTON IS MY FAVOURITE TALK SHOWWWWW
Are you alright?\n\nJust good.\n\nGives a big smile. I swear in his mind, he's chanting that he can't believe Margot is doing to this... Doing a tattoo on his foot. It's like his dreams just came true.
Harrison’s face when he was offered the tattoo 😂... I wish he had done it
Lol Harrison Ford and all of them are awesome
Hey Graham, did you know Kit Harrington was selling his car? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-MHoIyW4E0&t=1s
Can this be the start of their love story ? Please please please :D
Harrison Ford is lucky that his training in his previous profession has prepared him for the style of acting he aspires too, he was a carpenter wasn't he?
Reese Witherspoon look like she boutta take out a knife and stab Margot in the neck
Graham looks like he taped his suit with black duct tape
whats his name the old guy
Reese is a buzz kill :/
That IT smile in the thumbnail's just creepy
Don’t get tattooed by someone who calls it a “gun”😂
Harrison Ford is done with this world
Margot is so cool and a bit weird
is that woman sitting by Margot,  the girl from clueless ?
She could tattoo me all day !!! Love u Margot !!!
Now cut it and sell that toe on eBay. Lol.
She is so cute :)
Margot robbie can tattoo me any second of my life
The new Marilyn Monroe. Sexiest white girl living

Reese Witherspoon is a dull
I love Harley but not this women. I think I'm in love with a character 😭😭😭😭
His toe is now on sale on ebay.
Tattooed by Margot Robbie while sipping on Harrison Ford's drink.\nThat's pretty much as good as it's ever gonna get...
One of the best couches there's been on this show!
Reese really wasn't comfortable sat next to a lowly peasant. I know she has this bubbly down to earth persona but you can just tell in reality she's nothing but a complete stuck up snob.
What a story to tell
Margot Robbie could chop my toe off and it would be the best thing that's ever happened to me
I kinda like the idea of a smiley face on the bottom of my toe.
I was like 'oh that's gonna hurt' (feets are pretty sensitive and hurts more) and when I saw his expression I knew I was right.

That should have been me
Go watch my vids :)
I wouldn't mind injecting some of my liquid into her
My teacher said to my I'm a failure, that I'll never amount to anything. I scoffed at him. Shocked, my teacher asked what's so funny, my future is on the line. Well...you see professor I say as the teacher prepares to laugh at my answer, rebuttal at hand. I watch Rick and Morty. The class is shocked, they merely watch pleb shows like the big bang theory to feign intelligence, not grasping the humor. ...how? I can't even understand it's sheer nuance and subtlety. Well you see...WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB! One line student laughs in the back, I turn to see a who this fellow genius is. It's none other than Albert Einstein.
Your voice is so prepubescent and obnoxious that I couldn't get past the first 2 minutes.
this guy probably just like put a picture of dan harmon and just spoke into the microphone to change and edit his voice pretty cheap i am a fan of this show but really cheap but sometimes he talks so fast and fancy he changes our minds and we think he is smart but when really not dont let your mind get washed by his fast motor mouth actually take the time to actually research and dont always just accept what he says because he sounds smart
Love the John Wick mention
HOLY FRIG!!!!!!!The creator of RICK AND MORTY Came onto your show!?oh oh!who's next!!:)
Actually, rats are rather intelligent, while probably not Kung fu master intelligence, but smart enough to do mazes, solve puzzles, and even sniff out land mines.
I love your vid so don't stop making them PLZ!!!!!!!!!!!
Yesterday I took an IQ test but instead of the usual questions they showed me an episode of Rick and Morty and asked me to analyse all of the jokes. Since i'm a genius I was easily able to do so. I explained all the references from the fact that bird person is based off Greek mythology, to the theory that Rick is inspired from a character in ancient mongol literature. As a result I was told I have an IQ of 190 if not higher.\nSome jealous friends of mine have since theorised that it wasn't an actual IQ test and I just got extorted by some druggies, oh how I pity them for inventing such ridiculous theories just to feel better about their lack of critical thinking and understanding of such an advanced show. They are blinded by their anger and frustration at the fact that I possess an extremely high IQ.
Doesn't the brain require oxygen and constant blood flow?\nRick also holds his breath while traveling through the sewers.\nDoes that mean he has lungs?\n\nThe rat brain is also attached the ricks back. It's not in-cased in anything.\nso exposure to heat and air will cause the brain to rot faster, turning into mush over time.\n\njust the fact that you throw opinionated views makes you sound like a cuck.\n\nIt just not possible.
i don't know this dan harmon guy is, but hey he has the same last name as i do.
Holy crap Dan once again Rick can probably take care of that salt problem
lol Overwtach is salty or Matpat just put that in there because he didnt now what else to use
Mat pat forgot one inportant piece of info, near the end of the episode rick asks Beth for the syringe back saying that he's dying because of something that the show ends up not telling us, but we are led to believe that it could have the salt poisoning that Mat said before because all the symptoms of salt poisoning line up with ricks behaviors in the episode, some of the symptoms include: \n1. Salt poisoning typically results in a feeling of jitteriness \n2. a strong feeling of thirst\n Acording to the episode (near the beginning) we get a look of the weather outside with it being a nice sunny day but when rick rolls into the driveway it looks like a 100° to him. Here he's experiencing one of the symptoms thirst, it can also be backed up by the fact that when it started to rain rick did so much as open his pickle mouth to let in the moisture into his pickle body.  \nRick also experienced another symptom of salt poisoning which is the feeling of jitteriness which can obviously be explained by rick's enjoyment during his killing spree of the rats and multiple human security guards and how he constantly, happily yells out PICKLE RICK!!!!! everytime he gets a chance in these scenes.\nWe can also assume that has the average amount of sodium in his pickle body 785mg of salt. A lethal dose of salt is about 3,300mg  so even assuming that all the salt had contact with his brain/human parts rick should have been fine not not have experienced the symptoms as quickly as we see him making so that pickle rick could be a thing just not for long periods of time which rick should have figured himself finding how upset he was about both taking the syringe and how concerned rick was with its safety.\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_poisoning \nhttp://www.skepticforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=11412
I'm making fan art about matpat and Dan \n\nMatpat:Just us Dan at uh matanddan.com!
Did Dan Harmons cardiologist really tell him he's dying?
Maybe Rick just turned himself into a cross between a pickle and an avocado, or a genetically modified pickle with less salt. Simple.
Maybe rick's augmentations help him survive
I'm eating a pickle while I watch this.
Should’ve asked about that gravity falls crossover

Guys, a pickle is obviously a meat
Hmmm let me RELISH this hahahahahahahaha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOk I'll leave
this isnt a fucking theory goddamnit
As an overwatch fan that’s very true about how it’s salty
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Film theory. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head.
mat i dont want to boost your ego or anything but literally what are you so funny for. i laugh at nearly everything u say . i hate it
Does anybody think that evil morty is actually a rick ?
Your voice makes me want to kill myself
Absolutely my favourite collaboration of all time
It went from fnaf, to rick and morty. milk it more dad
what if rick turned his human parts into pickle version, but they work just as normal you can see is eyes and teeth are green, hes is the smartest man in the world after all.
Hey, Morty it's me LOOK
Feel bad for Dan Harmon , he got divorced
This was awesome!!! Dan Harmon was a hilarious addition for the video
This was such an innovative way of ranting, I love your editing style! I look forward to more great content
You forgot one fact. When he was in the helicopter with jaguar. Rick said his daughter was five minutes away and had eight minutes to live. What if the salt poisoning would kill him after a few hours. The entire episode took place in an hour anyways. I mean think about it. Also I should be in ur next rick and morty video. I have ft and skype
anyone else as pissed off that he <or anyone else> refers to himself as a Rickle?
i cringed so hard while watching this
What if all the main organs were in the body but very small so the bullet wouldn’t touch them but were in a second layer of skin so the high amounts of salt would not effect it sort of like a pickle costume but rick has no limbs also sub to my channel I make awesome beats
It is fruit
hey how do super heros get rich
My kinda episode
Insert your overwatch players are salty jokes here
Literally ripped off the research done by chabnel frederator
Avocados don't have trans fats, like you mention in the video.
8:34 When MatPat was talking about the nervous system he showed a picture of the circulatory system. BOOM!
dan what are you doing
Mmmh. I'm really not happy with this theory because there is a gigantic thing you missed: the ability of nerves to conduct electricity. In a living body, K+ and Na+ are constantly pumped to either side of the membrane of a nerve cell (Na+ outside of the cell, K+ into the cell). This process is vital to even make it possible, that an electric current can be lead along a nerve cell and it uses A FUCKTON of energy. Like seriously, if you were to lie in bed without motion nor thought for an entire day, 2/3 of your energy consumption is because of this K/Na pumping. \nNow correct me if I'm wrong, but without this process, there is no way for the electric current from Pickle Ricks tongue to reach a cockroach limb, right?\nStill love the fact tho that we come together on this channel to talk about sentient pickles, dead cockroaches, neuroscience, rat limbs and basic biological principles all in the same video.
Loved this episode!!
7:37 lmao😂 did matpat call Dan Stan??
My dad let me watch this. Somthing abou tbuilding my sense of humour
Rick and Morty 4 life!!!!! Pls do more Rick and Morty videos.....
Yeah I’m a pickle Pickle rick
In the episode Rick does say that he only has a certain amount of time to live to Jaguar he most likely measured out how long he be able to live with pickle brine in his brain
It can also be assumed that Pickle Rick has lungs, seeing as he used a Cigarette while he was on the helicopter.
it is from Old boy, not John wick
Rat brain looks like the tip of a dick😂
I want to be a avocado now. AVOCADO RICK!!!!!!!
What if the pickle brine...isnt pickle brine? It could be like a shell the brine in one of the layers protecting the necessary organs for rick to survive
But what about this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=WPUKKHcYo2c
How much is a smekel
Hmm... hmmm.... hmmmmmmmmm... I'm going to put together a grant proposal to transplant a human brain into an avocado.
Rick can make a suit made of a rat head and roach parts, tony Stark your move.
People actually look for a deeper meaning in this Rick and Morty show? There's no real science or hidden meanings. It's just a cartoon, losers.
anyone else caught that community reference?
do the bell thing people.\n\nDO IT
14:42 can you drive I don't have a car
MANBEARPIG, MANBEARPIG, MMMMMMANBEARPIG! Give us that!
Guac rick. Rickamole.
PICKLE RIIIIIIICK
Get a fucking haircut.
Did anyone else notice Shawn Spencer from psych
Matpat is correcting Dan HAHAHA XD
#sixseasonsandamovie
Who did the captioning.
he sounds like theodd1sout
Nice salt joke m8...
Ron Paul = Jake Paul CONFRIME?????/ ilumnante is everyday in the elction
I think Pickle Rick only worked in this situation because Pickle Rick was nearly dried up, and was practically washed around in the sewers, so maybe a lot of the pickle brine washed off Pickle Rick and that's why Rick doesn't die from Salt Poisoning. That's just my theory.
Can you solve this https://youtu.be/UDSfMmwNU2w
pretty sure rick would survive the pickle brine to hes brime from the time he turns himself  into a pickle to where hes cured in the car so dan im pretty you owe matt lunch instead
Jesus Christ, Harmon sounds bored out of his mind. Who pushed him into this? He definitely doesn't want to be here.
of course it works. rick would be dead or lost or something if it didnt. mat wasted time on this video. also the added conversation with th creator or co creator was absaloutley  retarded . complete waste of time
bad
Hi
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZTqQJntqpk&t=122s
PIIIICkLE RIIIIICK \n\n\nNo ok
HI I’m mr meessies! Like if u know what I’m talkin about😂
Awww! Isaac is so cute! I can’t wait to see what Ayla will look like when she’s a bit older.
lol tim is so funny forward the ending of the vid,
I love your vlogs as always . It always cheers me up 😊
I might have missed something but how come you guys are in HK?
Also how are alll your guy friends sooo handsome. I mean damn💕😭😍
I love tims mom.  She seems so easy to get along with.  She seems nice and down to earth.
2:36 reminded me of old times when you guys were in Hong Kong with your gel liner on your hand
SO CLOSE TO A MILLION SUBSCRIBERS!!!!
My stomach was bothering me right after I ate chipotle and I had to go into the Ulta bathroom :) and people kept knocking on the door so I was ready to cry because my stomach was killing and no one would leave me alone!!
sorry i think i missed it... but why are they in hong kong?
GUYS... \n\nSHE'S ALMOST AT ONE MILLION!!!
Hey Bubz!! I love your vlogs (even more than your beauty channel!) Are you going to do a new intro to your videos?
I did the same thing but I got home to a surprise b day party for me! I had a plastic bag stuck to my bum and had to keep my back to the wall to get to the bathroom.  It was horrible. But now it's a great funny story  so you are not alone sh*t happens
Im visiting HK for only a couple days next week.. really hope to coincidentally meet you bubzz... much love from indonesia..
It happens to the best of us love! Actually today was a close call....car rides and ibs don't mix....meditation works sometimes...😅
Tim: are you recovered yet?\nBubz: i'm still not completely recovered by the way...\nTim: i was referring to your self-esteem\n\nI DIED! LMAO
Idk but it's the cutest thing for me when I see a man holding a baby!
oh bubz I was eating when you started talking about what happened 😂😂
It's very common for baby's to have a white tongue because they are on an all white diet (milk). It's not considered thrush unless she has white plaques on her cheeks that don't come off when you rub them, +/- very red, angry bum.
I had a chicken salad today, it was delicious. Dont worry about the accident it happens to the best of us, almost happened to me before luckily i made it home on time. Dont ever feel bad! The babies are looking beautiful! \nxoxoxo
Omg I'm currently eating a rocky road icecream haha. Ayla and Isaac are so cute!
i once was on a train, 20 minutes from home and i knew it was gonna happen. i was in so much pain and my friend was trying to distract me. i called my dad to pick me up from the station as i knew i wouldnt be able to walk an extra 20 minutes home. i managed to just about hold it in, i have never ran so fast to the toilet in my life.\nanother time, i had just started taking antidepressants and they are known to give you an upset stomach. i was lying in bed and i was like, “why was that fart so hot?” and yes. it was poo.\n\n\nyoure welcome. x
“Have you recovered yet?” “Oh I was referring to your self esteem” 😂😂
at least it happened in a private car and not public transportation lol!!! Can you imagine?? :x
The way you both parent together works so well, beautiful family 😍❤️
Ayla's sleeping kick was the best!!!!
I can wait for Ayla to grow up she's going to be the cutest little girl 💕
Actually tbh sh*t happens' was my first thought last time, I just didn't want to be mean to you lol
Haha! My parents used to do the same thing y'all did to my brother when he was younger. He only liked to eat steak, so they told him everything way steak (chicken, pork, beef, fish, etc) lol
I just woke up from a dream of shitting myself and now you tell your story about shitting yourself lmao love you bubz!!!! ❤️😂
When you said at least it didn't happen in the street... made me think of the skit you did of when your were young and it was your grandma from your comedy channel 😂😂😂
why are they bck in Hongkong ?
4:34 haha issac riding on tim's back in the background was the funniest 😂😂😂
God You're so brave for telling us that poop story. I'm proud of you. It might've sucked But at least u have a funny story to tell ppl ^^
I'm so excited to watch Ayla and Isaac's relation grow deeper as they grow older 😊 they are so sweet
Baby Ayla is such a little dolly! Everytime I see her I'm just undone. I can't. those cheeks and her little rosebud lips. Your children are so darling and sweet!
Is it just me that feels like crying seeing her old appartment? Makes me realise just how far she and tim has come! Love bubs so so much!
Seeing you, Tim & Isaac back in HK is so nostalgic for me 😭 it's crazy now seeing how big Isaac is & then seeing Ayla there as well~
Why are you repeating the same story twice?
OMG LET'S GET BUBZ TO 1 MILLION SUBS !!!!! :'O we're almost there
Outsider's (a Korean rapper) daughter gets mistaken for a boy😅 But want to know something that her, Isaac, and Ayla have in common??? The three of them are some of the cutest kids that I have ever seen!
It's so funny that when Isaac was younger, everyone mistook him for a girl and now, Ayla is being being mistaken for a boy. Some people... :D I may have missed it in a previous vlog, but who is taking care of Chubby and Domo?
I missed the apartmennnnttt
bubz omg you crack me up so much thank you for always brightening up my day 😂❤️
ahahahaha it happend to to me.. i get my husband key.. and went in the car first and i did it in the parking lot   but good thing i have always a diaper in my bag for my baby.. ahhahaha.. it happens
I need to stop eating dinner while watching buds vlogs 😂
I seriously thought I heard my son crying and realized it was actually Ayla when you said Oh babe, can you get Ayla? to Tim.
Bubz i have been watching you for god knows how long. I love you so so so much!!! I really aspire to be like you. You are so beautiful, open, honest, kind, caring. I absolutely love watching your videos and i only wish i could have you as a life friend! You are amazing and your family is beautiful!!!!
How fast Isaac is growing !! He gets more cool looking everyday !! Love his new haircut 👦🏻👦🏻👦🏻👦🏻👦🏻👦🏻
Aww😄 Isaac playing with Tim in the background was funny! ❤️ (4:30-4:52)
Your so close to one million subscribers!!
Are you recovered yet? I was referring to your self-esteem!  LOL Tim can be savage sometimes!!!!
Omg that guy on the far left who drank that horrible alcohol drank 😂 is so cute
It's happened to all of us at one point!😁
Whoa, those were some handsome men at the wedding 😘😏 can I have one?
I  how it is lindy...my daughter had always pink on when she was a baby and even with a pink hat with her name on it...people asked if she was a boy. I was like seriously would a boy be called isabella....
I guess that's the silverlining .................
Your babies are all very adaptable :) so blessed
Whaa bubz kept her HK apartment?? I havent kept up to date with vlogs. . Its great to see it again
My daughter  had thrush on her tounge  for ages shes now 4.5months old and she had it for the first 3 months of her life we gave her the medication  it stayed for a while then finally went
So cute seeing Tim and Ayala in the background during your story time!
Lol Tim just had to choose that night to drive slowly. And that moment when you take your marriage to whole new level. But it can happen to anyone Bubz so it's okay. Just hope your complex security person isn't one of your viewers though.
I was watching Tim play with Ayla and Isaac while bubz told her car-crap story. Hahaha oh my goodness so adorable
Bubz you have to dress her up pretty in pink to differentiate and if they still call her a boy you can call them colourblind :)
bubz, how about new intro because theres ayla's now?   💓
Poor Bubz, I really hope you recover well. (Gosh, everyone right now is getting sick.) Don't feel ashamed about your accident, it happens. I've been in your shoes before but I grew out of it. My Mom suffers from digestive problems as well and one thing that helps her stomach is eating a whole lemon. (It seems to work well for her but you don't have to try it.) Eating peppermints also works too sometimes or drinking peppermint tea works just the same. Ginger root is pretty good for digestive problems, it tastes really well and you can put it on food, make it into tea, or just eat it plain. Hope your recovery goes well, Bubz~! Lots of love and prayers from California~!
bubz u should change intro to put Ayla  into it  today vlog so funny
My parents went through it before  your not alone 🤣
Bubz, you should leave an open box of baking soda in Tim's car, it should help with the smell! :)
Wonder if the groom was ok after downing that nasty mix drink😂🤔\nAnd after having 2 kids I still sneeze and pee myself😭
PLEASE PLEASE do the onigiri baby thing! It was a trend in Japan for a while and I think Ayla is the perfect fit :D
hey great video! love all your videos, your children are so cute :) :) :) you have such beautiful hair! i was wondering what kind of shampoo and conditioner do you use, how often do you wash your hair, thank you in advance!
if rotavirus gets on your hands you will get sick to your stomach!!
Anyone knows why they've returned to HK?
It's okay bubz my little one had her second lot of immunisations two weeks ago and I had a really bad tummy twice in a row! Luckily I didn't mess myself but I think the rota virus is really easy to catch with babies and whom ever is changing them lol! 💖
just wondering if aylas thrush has settled since this?? you might have to be treated as well because it can be contracted through your nipples even if you don't have any symptoms. I had a few issues with it with my first baby and it finally went away once we both were treated at the same time.
When my sister was a baby everyone thought she was a boy, and then my brother when he was a baby everyone keep saying what a cute little girl.
It is so fine Bubz.. I crapped myself too and I am 22. I was walking home from night shift and my stomach got upset. I was just too tired to hold it in :D and you cant even run with upset stomach at the point. I was so lucky no one saw me. My pants was hot mess tho and I managed not even my flatmates to find out. I crapped myself but I am still winner!
What is going to happen to Domo?
I really enjoy seeing Ayla, cutest baby ever!! How much does Ayla weigh now Bubz? :)
Awww Poor bubz :/ but life goes on :)
https://youtu.be/rKaarkPsMoA\n\nNew video!
Awe bubz love you guys ❤️❤️❤️❤️
kinda TMI
Uncle Benny is very handsome :3
Get her headbands.
Happy autumn festival 中秋節快樂.....
LOOKS YUMMIEEEEEE
When you gotta go... GO!
:D
Almost 1mil subs
Ayla is so cuuuute 😍❤️❤️❤️
Yeah... I'm not buying from you anymore \nMe... every time a sales lady follows me around.
Perhaps not the best story to hear over dinner 😂
Don't worry bubz I pooped myself in front of my boyfriend just recently. It was only a little bit and I just casually excused myself to the bathroom so I don't think he noticed. He later asked why I wasn't wearing panties so I played it off by acting sexy xDD He's the type of person that doesn't mind bodily functions and stuff like that(he even helped me blow my nose when I was sick with his bare hands since my hands full...) but I don't think I can ever tell him about it...at least not in the near furture xD
Didnt you talk about it last vlog.. Haha - move on bubz move on! It's gross... Im hangin in coz i love you 😘
I remember Benny from your vlog in 2010 or 2011 when he went to HK to visit you. He looks even younger.
I never noticed that birthmark in your hand before :/
Aww, I feel for you so much sweetie... From what you're describing I'd definitely say it's a rota virus side effect, the sweating and the rush are not normal in the sense that you've just waited for too long... That or some mild digestive problems, but definitely not your lack of self control 😜 if it makes you feel a bit better, it happened to me on the very top of a really reeeealy high mountain - not in my pants but there was literally NOWHERE  to hide, imagine, peak of the highest mountain, no bushes, just rocks, but about 15 people around 👌 so I asked them to look the other way, there is about 360' of other options on a top of a mountain... I just felt couldn't delay it any longer cause it was a nasty virus, my only possible decision was either pants stay up or not.
I'm only here to find about Domo? did they give him away?
Share this video with someone who needs to improve their vlogs!\nRemember to _`Like'_ the video if you learnt some great vlogging tips! 👍
F*ck it i'll use stock footage *leaves like* <3
Can't wait to see your star wars cameo :^)
Awesome video! Could you please take me to Hogwarts, too...? 😉🙏
THE QUEEN CAME BACK
Now this is a great vlog!!
I love how toms face and name changes EVERYTIME!\n( favourite is beep beep XD )
*phone answers, guns shots and violence heard* yup that's TomSka alright.
I'm taking notes!
Ami, as always love your sense of humor! Your videos are bright bits in this sometimes crazy dark world. FYI: I hope it isn't too unoriginal or derivative but with the my new channel branding I took inspiration from your motto with my updated channel upload schedule. :) Be well and safe!
How have I just only now found this channel?
I see Spiderman, really let himself go!
the drone part  HAHAHA omg I'm dying its so funny !!!! ben video so far
You are so beautiful.
I don’t know if she’s real or not I’m confused, very confused
You lied to us!! It's not a cameo in the next Star Wars!! You're the next hot Bond Girl!!
Lol what is this
Tom's Contact Info keeps changing.
New videos every someday. Just like Natalie Tran\n\noh wait, that would imply Natalie uploads videos
Love the gag with Tom's picture on the phone.
FINALLY AFTER ALL THIS TIME I FOUND YOU NOW THAT I'VE GOT YOU IM GONNA subscribe
Your life is boring? U should see mine e_e
Lol dat train ride tho, you were cool as ice with those sunglasses
But... she said a swear! My heart is fucking shattered
I think we're all waiting for that mopping vlog.
One of my favorite videos~ tho all of your videos are great!
I love how the Profile thing and name keeps changing
Not gonna lie- this made me giggle. Giggle away a little mischievous schoolboy.
Aw man that was great!  So funny!
Ami: AH f*** this is taking forever
Are you friends with Barbie?
1:30    Wow.... That pretty much sums up my channel..... #MyChannelSucks   :(
Ami, the queen of trolling and satire <3 loved the video!!! :D
3:05 that's a good touch giving the phone a delay. A lot of people don't notice that when on the phone.
The only thing I see exciting at weddings is the grooms fainting in fear. I don't blame them. Check it out on Youtube.
That was one glamorous train ride.
Holy shit this video is perfect
This video is gold. I loved it so much oh my gosh
3:22 Time for some self examination lol
You said that you'd use stock footage, so it comes as no surprise that the video of Westminster Bridge is indeed stock footage. Riddle for you: Could we have known that it is stock footage, even if you had not mentioned it? If yes, how?
Who else has sawn the rabbit guitar dude at 3:45 in Xiao's video? 😂😂
you were the original lil miquela queen
That drone part made me burst out a loud ha!
Must've been a shotgun wedding.\nSorry.
That feeling when for a second you thought she used stock footage for the drone shot... -_-
Toms name kept changing\nAnd I was like\nDamn toms car\nCan’t you get anything right
Tom's face keeps changing XD\nAnd name.
When you post I think a part of my soul has been chipped away and given to you. I love it
Looking forward to the next video, Ami! Just uhh... 2 months? Maybe 1 and a half?
Glad to see that you're work is as spectacular as ever!! Keep it up!!
Been missing you!!!  My wife & I really enjoy you.  :)
Pretty much me if I ever decided to vlog.\nDid a few things, ate some snacks, same old, same old
Oh look she has a drone then pops ups word I realise it was google earth lol I'm dumb.XD
I'm not playing video games, *I'm at a wedding* \n \n\nI'm dead 😵
I'm laughing so hard
He was talking about Casey neistait .I LOVE it .
Did you get to meet Rey?
Bomb bomb that was Tom
One thing you could do is upload more regularly. Come on, other vlog channels upload daily, yet at your pace it almost seems like you're a YouTube animator.
This was a wonderful surprise in an otherwise gloomy day.  Thanks Ami 🤗
Awesome! You are so Creative **0** <3

Il ont oublier le Logo Pegi 18
Bon ok on s'est fait démonté la gueule, mais je suis content d'avoir vu mon équipe jouer, proposer quelque chose, et pas garer le bus comme on fait et feront certains. Après forcément avec des lacunes defensives telles, contre un Paris efficace et impitoyable comme celui de samedi on prend une branlée, mais merde on finit avec 17 tirs, 6 de plus que Paris, qu'on vienne pas a me dire que ce match annonce un saison catastrophique, au contraire.
Supporter du psg je tire mon chapeau au FCGB qui ont proposés du jeu et respectés le football. ..donc quand je vois des gens se moquer je trouve ça ridicule quand on sait que leur équipe se met à 11 dans les cages en attendant que ça siffle . Donc 6-2 oui mais une opposition digne de ce nom.
Neymar, Mbapé e Cavani, melhor ataque atualmente ❤\nPSG futuro campeão da liga dos campeões.
#TeamPaname 🔴🔵
I from Brazil and I can say , Neymar is the best player of the world at the moment , when Neymar guy played  Santos team  by Pelé  , I always watched , so i wanna say Neymar I love you bye
Pour une fois qu'une équipe ne gare pas le bus pour essayer de prendre 1 point. Merci au Girondin d'avoir joué normalement et d'avoir rien lâcher même avec 6 but pris.
Brésil mon amour!
En tant que marseillais je ne peut qu' être objectif. Je trouve cette équipe de Paris impressionnante. l'attaque est juste monstrueuse. Franchement ça fait peur. Cette année en ligue des champions vous pouvez faire quelques choses de propres.
The True Meaning Of (WAKING UP😪👉 https://youtu.be/00wYHWg1c7s
Quand on regarde les stats 6-2 c'est un peu violent  ; mais bon face à un psg comme ca en confiance après le 3 - 0 au bayern , sans faire le bus comme montepellier , à l'éxtérieur et en ayant au final plus d'occasions que le psg ( assez grosse domination bordelaise en fin des deux mi temps ! ) le contenu proposé était franchement sympoa et même si on se prend 6-2 le match était beau à regarder après la défense et le gardien bordelais ont un peu raté leur match un manque d'engagement ( comme l'a dit rabiot ) car les bordelais partaient un peu vaincus alors qu'ils auraient peut etre pu faire mieux , mais si on regarde la match en soit et pas uniquement le score , moi je trouve que ca présage du bon surtout que l'équipe est encore en rodage ! moi je suis content de ce match même si symboliquement parlant se prendre 6 buts dans la gueule ca fait mal , et en différence de buts cest que un de plus que le bayern donc moi je dis , allez bordeaux !

les gens préfère trappe rien mdr  et maintenant il préfère   areola  juste pasque il a fait un match de fou face au bayarn  arêtes  un peux      \nil faut choisir  un gardien  numéro 1 pour moi c'est pas les 2
DIEUX MERCI QU ON  A PAS MIS CRISTIANO RONALDO DANS L ÉQUIPE AVEC NEYMAR SINON ÇA AURAI ÉTÉ GRAVE
Paris sont impressionnants et monstrueux...Je redoute le 22...allez l'OM ⚪🔵🔵⚪⚪🔵🔵⚪
Pour une fois que Marseille fait un bon match de son côté... tout le monde s'en fout vu que le vrai régal était (encore) au Parc.
J habite a bordeaux et.on.c fais baiser
Ce PSG va faire mal cette saison.
On a vu que le gardien de but bordelais était décourager au 5eme but du PSG
paris aussi. un  équipe mdr
J'aime voir les fan du PSG qui aime leur idole neymar, mais sachez que vous avez une équipe , et que c'est pas seulement grâce q lui que vois gagnerD'autant plus que Draxler ou encore Mbappe se donne encore plus que neymar sur la pelouse ! L'argent a eu raison de la ligue 1 , GG ^^
va t'informer sur les statistique de messi et cr7 a 25 et puis revient Parler, donner juste quelque mois a mbappe et vs allez voir quil Sera la start du psg
quelque'un peut dire à Neymar qu'il a oublié d'enlever ses bigoudis
Super le PSG et trop fort
C'est pas score de foot mais un score de tennis
On est pas chaud nous
Verrati à quand même pris du sale 😂😂😂😂
Alai on atten les petite fiote de marseillais
Ceux qui pensent que c le psg qui remporte la ligue 1 likez moi ça
Le PSG marche sur la France a pas de géant!
les lyonnaise qui essaient d’exister a travers le PSG c'est pathétique mdr on a tiré sur la barre  ^^
Réactions des supporters sur PSGfanTV en direct du Parc des Princes 🔵🔴🔥\nhttps://youtu.be/e_G_yi9vEp0
serieux ont pas l'impression qu'ils ne font pas le meme metier....
La reprise de draxler et le coup franc de neymar 😍
costil :(
Se prendre que des buts en contre, par le psg, au parc... C'est quand même un comble. A vouloir jouer son jeu Gourvennec a juste offert le match. \nCa n'a aucun sens.
Sans déconner cassez vous au Qatar les parigots, vous pourrissez la ligue 1.
Aller om
Ptn mais qui va battre cette équipe 😂 c'est plus possible la mdr ils ont même pas pitié de leurs adversaires avec leur score de tennis 😂 je pense que nous on a soufrir le 30 octobre Garcia bon nous caser un petit 451 comme il le fait quand on affronte des équipes du top 10 x)
Sa prend deux but a la maison contre bordeaux parcontre contre la juve ou le real ce sera pas 2 but
Toute façon paris cest bien beau de faire les beaux en championnat mais on attend toujours quelque chose de votre part en europe car a part collectionner les 8eme et les quarts de final ca monte pas plus haut et tout les ans on entend objectifs champions league. Mais quand il sagit du barca ou du real bah ca fait plus grand chose pour moi paris est juste une equipe europeene on va dire moyen haut car a part une coupe intertoto cest tout ce que vous avez\nMais vu les quelques matchs que jai vu cette année vous pouvez la tentez elle est large a votre porter \nBon courage a vous pour leurope \nUn supporter bordelais
Messi The best
👀.
c'est moi ou di maria devient roulier il perd des duels il fait de  mauvaise passe.
Tout les Français dois avoir Fiers de Marseille unique à gagné LDC
Vous voyez les Parisiens faire ça contre la Juve, le Réal, le Barça, Manchester United ou Manchester City?
Le PSG est une très belle équipe, toujours agréable à voir jouer. Vous devriez être content s'avoir une telle team en France. Mais non, vous faites les chauvins simplement car ils ont de l'argent.
Mbappe c'est le seul travailleur franchement j'le kiff ce gamin j'aime trop quand il marque
Ligue 1 Conforama ? Ils sont serieux avec la pub là c'est honteux
Que c'est beau le pouvoir de l'argent sur un championnat sans but
C'est normal que le psg gagne c'est tous des braisilien
Quand Meunier marque c toujours un bon match mdr
Bonne nouvelle kurzawa s est blessé en EDF
Au moins Bordeaux joue au foot et pas au casino
je suis fanne de  lom est je reconnait que le psg sont monstrueux . mais il faut reconnaitre que l'om a fait un match de foues contre nice
AUCUNE GLOIRE NI FIERTÉ A AVOIR lorsque tu joue dans un championnat ultra faible niveau ligue 2 et que les médias essayer de nous vendre ça comme un somment de ligue 1 ; XPTDR.. Surtout lorsqu'en plus tu a des joueuses bordelaises qui se couchent de suite et qui attendent la fin du match pour faire des selfies avec NEYMAR !! Pitoyable.. Une seule chose positif, très beau but de Neymar et celui de Draxler par contre..
la ligue 1 est faible pour le psg
4-2 POUR MARSEILLE POLOPOPOOOPO AH merde c pas ce match excusez moi ...
En league 1 il n'y a que le psg qui m'intéresse le reste des équipes pas intéressant
Draxler ptn je l'aime trop \nBerchiche je le trouve bon
Ligue 1 is shit only one good team no challenge or competition must be boring in that leauge u will hardly see a 4-6 nil in a leauge like  bpl
jolie la passe de mbappe sur le 2e but
Super match de basket
RIP TP
At 66 years... too soon. Sad to hear,  R.I.P.
I NEED TO KNOW.... :(
RIP
Another great musician leaves us...:(
you were a class act Mr. Petty u will be remembered forever
To Tom, I love you man, thanks! Signed, an Indiana girl, from an Indiana town.........
Hi Brian,\n\nDo you mind if I use a part of this video for a tribute I am working on? Happy to credit you on the channel, comments and description and even list you down as a collaborator.\n\nLet me know if you are OK with this.\n\nThanks & have a good day
rip tom. thinking of the fam. this one is for you peter. i know he was one of your music heros.  rip.
Was this the final song of his final public appearance? Either way so sad to learn of his death. RIP TP. Everybody watch his old SNL appearances tonight.
RIP Tom. So glad I took the trip to London to see you this summer. Thanks for all the music.
I was at this very show and it was my first (and now only) live performance from TPTH.  I am truly fortunate watching such a magical event with a good friend, good wine, good food and great entertainment.  You will be greatly missed by all of us for such an amazing career and iconic music.  Thoughts and prayers for you and your family.
Wish you,'d come around here again. RIP
Don't even know who this guy is but, RIP.
Love you Tom, Why must God take all the best, RIP, forever missed
RIP Tom Petty - thank you for the memories!!
Precious Tom...Heartbreaking.
(y) <3
Not Wildflowers...Yer So Bad.
R.I.P.!
Say hi to Glenn . . .
RIP Tom
One hell of a concert in heaven now. Too many, too soon.
Seen TP and Heartbreakers 7x between '85 and '93. Last night at Hollywood Bowl was my 8th time. In the past he was good. One of the best. Now? Don't know if aliens cloned him and left us the shitty version? But he sucked!! He's like Wayne Newton in Vegas. On autopilot. Same songs in same exact order with same exact talking in between songs. Same same same. SUCKED!! Bet he even  puts the condom on with his mouth for you, he's such a pro. Sucked!!
loved watching this Anna! You look so good and the backdrop was goals can i just say... will defo be eye-ing up a LOT of what you mentioned! Lav lav lav it xxxxxxx
Love the Dr Jart.  I finished one tube and agree about the packaging.  I took off the pump and turned it upside down for several days into a smaller pot.  Then I knocked the pot on the floor.  Splattered up into the air and landed on the carpet, the dog and places I probably still haven't found.  Still love the product.  So does my dog.
I love parks and rec too!!! So amazing that you met rashida!! \nBtw you should totally watch brooklyn 99 if you haven’t yet. It reminded me of parks and rec and i abolutely love it!!
great faves girl!
Oh my worddd 😜 Loved this vid
You're so cute❤️
You‘re so hilarious 😂
That DemyLee sweater looks SO cosy!
Glad you discovered this BB, it's been my favorite for years, def worth the youtube love ❤️
Brilliant story!! Loved the video x
That Rashida Jones story though 🤣... amazing!
What an amazing story!!
That whole Rashida Jones suitcase story 👌👌👌
And the lovable, adorkable award goes too... awww Anna!
The Rashida Jones story!!! 😱😱
Great video Anna! 👍🏻😄
Great Rashida Jones story time!
Hi
really liked your rashida jones story! lol
Hilarious 😆 lounge incident!!!
Rashida frickin Jones! 🤘🏼🎉😱
#luggagegoals I guess!
💕💕💕
You are too cute lol !
The happiness talking about the case I now understand 😆
You are so cute! What a great story! 👍🏻
I ordered three Birthday Cake Balm Dot Coms as well as a Stretch Concealer and can't wait for them to arrive! X
Haven't had any luck with Zoeva brushes, I bought two eyeshadow brushes (cant remember which ones) and they both give me an awful red rash.... :(
ca you please tell what size you are in zara jeans ... i want to buy these top shop ones but i'm not sure about size
This Rashida Jones story is the best thing this week ☺️💚
Hahaha u crack me up haha amazing, i can so imagine how chuffed u felt, whats the chance! Go g♥️rl😘👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
I loving your vids when I get a chance, I've said it before so cool and effortless chic. Love the video : )\n\nNatoya
You are SO adorable with that luggage story!!! 🤗😂
Hi Anna! I love your videos. Is there anyway I can get a nomakeupday jumper in xl?
Dr. Jart is pronounced with the J sound, not the Y sound :)
I love you. Period. You make me smile and giggle.\nThank you! :)
Great video! Thinking of getting the jeans but not sure what length - how tall are you? :) Thanks! xx
There's a light version of the dr jart B.B. Sometimes I mix it up. 🤗
That suitcase is so cute! Def planning to get one!
Hey Anna! Do the straight leg jeans give when you wear them or do they stay nice and snug? Xx
Just ordered 2 pairs of MOTO jeans 😎 Been on the hunt for a great everyday non-skinny style, hope these fit the bill!!!
Now all I can hear is Chris Traeger saying Anne Perkins. Great video, as always!
I love your accent!!xx
The Rashida Jones Luggage link doesn't work! It just leads to their main page :(  Are they sold out or unavailable now?
I'm also a serial luggage purchaser and the Away ones look like they could end my habit! Amazing - thank you :)
I love your hair!!
I thought it was Moto as in Motorbike as in Moto Jacket? Not Motto? Have i been pronouncing it wrong for like 12 years?
what is that brush you always use to put on your foundation? i need it!
you watch Parks n Rec! have you seen Brooklyn 99 as well?? it's by the same writers <3
Great video, Anna. I love the framing of this shot. I'm definitely tempted by that pretty suitcase (but don't think I travel enough to justify it - bummer!) xx
Love the story about the luggage :) The leopard print boots are so pretty. I will have to check out the jeans too.
You are the cutest! Such a cool moment!! :) and the luggage looks awesome too!!
I love september favourites because I am do not like necessarily researching new trends so I found your videos very helpful and I really like your energy. Great video x
I found out about Parks and Rec through you, and just streamed all the seasons. But it seems like the Rashida Jones collection is not on Away anymore?
That story time was so hilarious 😭😂😂
You're just adorable! Loved the Rashida Jones moment - looks like now I'll need some new luggage as well....
you walking past rashida jones would be me walking past you tbh
Rashida Jones is SUCH a badass, how did you resist asking her to go to coffee so you could pick her brain? (Please, I say that as if I would do that - I'd be as awkward as you were in that moment, because holy crap it's Rashida Jones!)
Love your videos! I feel like we are friends haha
So, you have a book signed by Aziz Ansari, and you've met Rashida Jones.... I am so jealous!!!
Rashida Jones just gave thumbs up on this video.
Anna, can you find a slightly enhanced version of Glossier Like? Been searching!
Oh Anna, now I've got the giggles; that was suitcase story gold. Thanks for sharing! See you next time!
I can't find the pink on their website. Don't tell me it's gone 😭😭😭
such a fun story! lol
The booties are sold out in every size. Can you suggest a dupe? Thanks.
I love Rashida Jones as well. This was a really cute post. I'm a luggage W_ore as well and now I must explore your suggestions. Have a great October.
Any tips on how to wash raw hem denim? I throw mine in the machine but the hem gets very frayed which is not the look I like. Thanks!
Loved this video! The Rashida Jones story was hilarious 😂! I always look forward to your videos and they never disappoint
Love your attitude and energy!!!
OMG your face as you tell Rashida Jones anecdote!! So funny! Exactly the face me and my girlfriends make when having a natter over a glass of wine 🍷
Literally got so excited for you when you were telling your rashida jones story 😂 my heart is like pounding lol. Love the video!
How would you compare the Dr Jart versus the IT cosmetics?
You Rashida Jones story is so entertaining, and the fact that you are so excited made me smile. Love the suitcase, shame I just bought a new hard case :(
Rashida is the sweetest! She came into my old job with some friends and hung out for a while. She was so lovely and we both made awkward jokes at each other. Now I just want to be friends with her!
I can't believe that you met rashida!! Parks and Rec is my fave as well! I truly believe you and I are the same Anna, love love all your content <3
Ahaha aww love the rashida jones story, I probably would've been the same as well 😝 So cool though that you met her, loved her on parks and rec!
Please so a workout video with your current routine <3
Your fan girl moment was both funny and sweet! 🤗And I LOVE my Away luggage!
You are so adorable. Especially about the Rashida Jones/luggage thing. Thanks for making me smile and well done on your charity... so much to smile about!
Liking the video before even watching it <3
Would love to see your YouTuber faves too!! I love finding new people and fellow YouTubers to watch xx
Anna, you totally made my evening. Laughed hard on your story about meeting Rashida Jones 😂 Fun fact (not related to luggage though) - Dr. Jart ‘s beauty balm formula is not the same in Korea (South, that is), the country where the brand is originally from, despite having exactly the same packaging. I live in Korea, and I am a big fan of Dr. Jart skincare range (btw if you can get your hands on their Cicapair serum I HIGHLY recommend it). I also purchased their bb beauty balm in high hopes to look like a sun-kissed beach goddess. I think I looked like my nanna’s pearls or her polished china instead. It gave me tonns of glow, but none of that bronze goodness, rather a whitish/pinkish tint 😔 which is not necessarily a bad thing, just not the look I’m going for. On a bright side- it does get better after it sits on my skin for an hour or so.
thank God! i thought you are going to take a break too!
Love your  Sunday videos Anna! The leopard print boots are still so beaut 😍
SUCCESS!!! ANN PERKINS APPROVED YOUR (her) LUGGAGE!!! <3 <3 loved the story!!  *high five*
where is the beautiful cupboard from?
Love a good story time! #LuggageTale 😂
Loved the story with the suitcases =)
The september newsletter rocked my world. Your style of writing is thoroughly enjoyable!
Love the suitcase, but the link doesn't work... I'm in Portugal, maybe that's the reason...
I love that I'm not the only one that turns to mush when they meet their idols. X
Anna, have you tried the Zoeva Luxe PETITE Crease brush?! OMG, it's definitely my favorite brush. It's obviously smaller than the regular one you mention here, but I find it so helpful for putting precise amounts of color in my crease or outer corner and then blending with the bigger brush.
I couldn't find the Rashida luggage on the Away website. I'm afraid it's gone 😭
OMG so in love with that CHANEL toiletries bag, where did you get that and can I still buy it? <3 <3 <3
dr Jart! not dr yart please!
Are you a male to female transgender? Born a man?
You ramble more than you should.
Anna, you're lovely and I love you to bits but PLEASE... Could you stop saying 'I feel like...' quite so much?! As a listener, once you pick up on it, you hear it every single time and trust me, it's a LOT of times...! 🙉
you always look amazing anna but can i say you look extra fab in this video? WOW! i’m screenshoting all the products you’re wearing to add to shopping list 😘😂

zion is getting better at controlling his voice osksjd yes
2:36 When Nick did that one dance move so hard, I'M LAUGHING SO HARD😂😂
They've been trying so hard to make this song and group happen 😂😂😂
I'm researching this after 10millionth time an I noticed something funny look at the old Lady's reaction in the front near Edwin at 1:47 😂

MY BOYS 💟💟
Who makes the high note??
Do they sing anything else?
their vocals are pretty bad tbh
They're getting more & more popular. They only need that hit song for them to hit it big. They still need a better choreography though & more singing lesson/practices. Hope they're diligent & not lazy like most american singers.
can someone tell me who is who??
PRETTY MUCH, KYLE, CHANCE, AND THE DOLAN TWINS...IM BEING SPOILED
all of these 12 year old girls commenting how much they love them.. who tf are these little boys? its seriously sad to see how bad music has gone downhill especially for  boy bands  where are the backstreet boys & NSYNC when you need them?? \n#90'sbaby #gtfo
This is giving me kpop debut stage teas.
TF is this? It's like a cheesy as mix of wannabe Bell Biv DeVoe and Backstreet Boys. I'd rather hear BBD then this shit. When will artists and bands learn that being unoriginal and sounding like a mix of certain artists/bands from the past will only result in absolutely nothing. TRL get it together and get real artists on the show or the viewership of 166 thousand will only go down and please get some real host. You don't need to put kids on everything in order to make it a hit comeback.
This is so good, but why would they drop a new single but then not perform that one on tv, just doesn’t make sense to me
BTS>>>>
WHAT A GAME! Thanks for everyone who made it possible. The Hashtag boys did us proud and Scotty Pollock is on a different level!
Theo barker on the bench?
How is Hesky a legend
Scott Pollock has a foot of god!
Tekkers Town defense was the worst thing ever
I love watching the Wembley cup final ⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️
It’s Baker not barker
I hope W2S does something on this
Did ChrisMD even play? Nowhere to be seen mate.
The Wembley Cup is just class
I can see all these comments after watching the game, yes you are right Hashtag United have played for over a year but Tekkers Town and Jeremy didn't complain. These guys at EE try so hard to make it happen at least have some respect for them. I 100% know if they said no more Wembley Cup you all wouldn't be happy. If I'm not mistaken F2 challenged Spencer and it was going to happen. The F2 said in the post match interview that it was a good game and they love a challenge. I liked this game a lot and they did a good job. Constructed Criticism is important but moaning that it wasn't fair. Of course Hashtag United had an advantage F2 knew that and they didn't complain after the game. Next time maybe enjoy the game than moan in the comments anyone with a Brain will know Hashtag United had chemistry and experience together. No harm intended.
sean was rubbish, misplaced nearly every pass, don't know why he was a MOTM contender
That was just not entertaining
Why didn't joe play
I was there yesterday
I think there was a lot of Arsenal fans there because they were always shouting shoot
Attacking is easy, defending is more difficult. Tekkers town defence had no tactical awareness which was why hashtag ripped them apart. But fair play to hashtag for such lethal attacks.
No one wanted hastag united to win because no one gives a crap about them. They ruined the wembley cup.
This is so set up next year do a real one spencer stop telling teams to let you win
Good job, Spencer. I literally could'nt believe my eyes that you won 6-1 against Tekkers Town!
It was like Chelsea v forest they lost 5.1
Next Year Chris MD Vs Hashtag United
Number 1 in trending well done spencer !!!
YES I wanted hashtag unidet to win and they did don'tforget to # it
Why is everyone saying that Hashtag ruined it? It gave the players a chance to play on the world's biggest stage instead of other YouTubers hogging the fame.
Lawrence is a loser
I got Andy Jeff’s watts autograph don’t forget to # it
elliot could have done more tbh think he just don't like to dive lol
Jez is absolutely clueless off the ball...
Hashtag were the better team and would have won even if tekkers town were more organized. Hashtag had the better team overall. Don't judge a player by their performances in crossbar challenges.
Great game I think go back to you tube teams with some hashtag players because it was to easy they play week in week out together
Why aren't hashtag wearing their new kits?
Billy would have won the game for TT
Heskey and KSI in the same team lol
I love it how the commentator was getting told off by the other one that was a pisser
They were funny the first time, but Geordie and the other guy need to be replaced by professionals to make the game more serious and intense. Still some funny moments though!
Don't forget to # it lads!!!!!!!
Spencer you pointed at me after the game
Laurence is the worst commentator ever, he doesn’t even know what he’s talking about
whats worse? Spencers athletic and football abilities or the commentating through out the event.
I went it was great \nPaper Aeroplane for days
Anyone else not find it weird when Mark Bright asked Scotty Pollock how old he was to which he answered 16 and then in response hands him a bottle of champagne when the legal age to buy alcohol in the UK is 18?
Phill martin is such an underrated player
wanna hear a joke?\n\n*Read more*
in the starting line up THEO BARKER
Jezza wasn't the same without Billy
Last year was more cool
Steven Gerrard's last game for Liverpool = 6-1...Steven Gerrard at Wembley Cup 6-1
They did there best but they couldn't keep it up with Spencer's team you took the glory away so well done
I saw me playing games on my phone 📱
Who watched the full match in the stream?
It isn't that hashtag is boring but they will be always superior than a Youtube+legends team that haven't trained!\nBring back spencer FC.
Chris played like garbage so did manny and jezza. Sean should stick to freestyling
Looks like Tottenham needs Theo Baker in their starting XI 🤔
stevie g didn't get a medal
Jeez the commentators HATE each other
Sign Jimmy Conrad with footage.He's gonna be great for the team and he still making money
Why are people buzzing about Scott Pollock?\nHe wasn't bad but he definitely doesn't deserve MOTM Theo does.
LITERALLY EVERY IMPORTANT SOCCER FINAL I VOTE FOR THE LOSING TEAM. THIS INCLUDED
the fact that Hashtag United won is a huge embarassment to the name of football.
That Hashtag chemistry made the big deffirence:-)
I really hope next year they let the teams have a couple weeks to practice before the match especially for tekkers. Hugh wizzy had a great game, made some great saves, that one goal was just great. Hashtag has the chemistry that was a huge difference, as well as stamina. But Scotty pollock got a lot of fame from this channel which is absolutely amazing for him. It would have been sick for billy to get a goal, but it was a good game. A couple bad plays from Harrison, but that's how he has always played. Don't forget to hashtag it boys!
How does Spence not have more subscribers?!?
Stop using so many legends, it makes it too hard to score. Gallas and Conrad on the same team and you expect youtubers to score against that.
next time win the cup
Can't wait for Chris to go over the game in his vid.\n\n\n\nWHO ELSE??
GREAT GAME BUT AWESOME COMMENTARY!!!\nSomeone call these guys in the Prem
It sucks billy didn't make it
no one hashtagged it for a celebration, disappointed
Where was rio
HOW WAS IT 6-1
tekkerz town couldn't defend
NOOOOOOOO I MISSED IT!!! 😭😭😭😭😭
Theo Barker lol they misspelled in the lineups lolsss
#######
Anyone else's audio messed up?
Booo hashtag
tekkers town was disapponting
GERRARDS PLAYING AT A FINAL AT WEMBLEY LOLOL
hi Spencer
Get zidan3 next time
Hashtag COME ON !!!!!! Hashtag it
6=1
Both teams played well tekkers town just underformed
I was there!
Wtf why is ksi not banging weller?
the stevie g effect : 6-1 😂😂😂
so happy
OKG KSI MEETS HESKEY HAHAHAHAA
Wtf i hate u hashtag poopunited
HESKEY TIME!!!
Hatrick Spencer! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Good Game Well Played Hashtag
Now play dons stop dodging
Hashtag would beat tottenham at wembley
Daniel cutting is married!?!?
Really bad
haha rip Robbie savage
You should bring in professional players in rather than legends switch it up
They should keep that kit for the 3rd kit and keep the green one for the goalie
America trips me out, this dumbass wants to actually go shoot this guy, (Atleast try) you might as well let him. no point sitting behind a barrcade with a gun like that cop. Unless u think hes gonna turn the gun on you well then fine i probably wouldn't give my gun up either, but you have that many fucking guns over there actually use them when its helpful?
When your teamate forgots to shop at spawn and tells you to drop your gun because they can carry you
Yea the cops gonna give a gun to a guy in camo shorts and the biggest cowboy hat they had at the Vegas souvenir shop. What a douche.
this isn't cool this is him being a bloody dumb ass trying to act hard. what the hell is he gonna do 😂
Who the fuck is the moron in the cowboy hat? What an asshole.
What a sell out ,
Everyone hoping this asshole would've got shot
What a fucking poser. Real people dying and your just trying to look like a hero
Hes sooo brave..doing everything possible to save everyone around him. Salute this man!
Change the title to Dan Blizerian annoys first responders
I've got even more respect for this guy, that's courage and no fear. Should get a medal of honour
When it's almost the final circle and there's still 6 alive.
Even security guys leave the safe cover just to stay away from this douchenozzle.
Doesn't matter if he has cop creds. \n\nDo you honestly think the cops are going to give a gun to a random guy wearing an Amish hat, Osama beard, and camo cargo shorts in the middle of a mass shooting?
You're an idiot
100% Governments work.\nMore than one shooter absolutely.\nFucking staged bull shit!\n😠😠🖕🖕
Hey officer, give me a gun.... said no one ever.  Like Wtf?
would be funnier if the cop just shot him
Ever since hearing about him from Ridiculousness a couple years ago, I never liked him. This makes me hate him
He let down his beard
Who the hell upvotes this?
I can't hear what he's saying.
This guy is a looser and glory hound, .A hes a glory hound in the sense if he was really trying to be a hero for the expressed purpose of helping people his little butt buddy following him around wouldn't have been there recording. And THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPING PEOPLE. This little fuck boy supposedly help one person, when other, not for glory of fame, tried to draw the shooters fire and render any sort of medical attention to the victims they could. Hell even the drunk guy who gave the bird and yelled fuck you in the basic direction of the shooter is a bigger hero than Danny boy here. No one likes a dipshit glory hound.
Who is this guy anyway???? If he's American..sorry I'm English and don't follow your news that closely that i know all the big names (if he's a big name lol)
How can i dislike this video more?
This man is a true hero he ran 12 feet.
the captain america scene in avenger vs reality
Who wouldn't run towards open fire
LMFAO 'GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME RIGHT NOW!'
Inbreeding is clearly a series problem, what a fucking moron.
When you play COD once.
Bump fire my ass. That was belt fed. M60 or a saw. Fucking morons the press are. It was not bump fire. Jesus jumping christ on a broken crutch. I was in the military for 22 years. Listen people, it was NOT bump fire. Jeesus!
Think about this: if this guy really just cared about helping, then why ask someone to FILM you doing it?!\nIf I were going to save someone from drowning I wouldn’t ask someone to get video coverage of it. I would just selflessly save the person. This idiot is all about appearances
One prime example of a BETA MALE
Everyone was led to believe the shooter turned the gun on himself but it was just dan bilzarian
What a clown. This guy is a male version of a Kardashian
*Runs a couple feet forward\n*Gets yelled at by security\n*Do nothing helpful\nI'm a hero guys!
Doesn't run to help injured but starts harassing cops to give him a gun and showing credentials at the worst possible time!\nThis guy is a fucking douchebag, coward who wants to be a jack Bauer but is just a spoilt rich kid who was kicked out of the marines for discharging on a range FFS!\nHot head, dude bro, rich guy wants to be a hero.........how unexpected!
Ha ha this douche bag tries to tell a cop he's a cop give me a gun ha ha couldn't he have been # 60
Watches first scene of batman v superman once.
Really lucky he didn't get the butt of that cops gun in his face.
WHy post this?\n\nHe had no gun on him.\n\nHe was beyond shooting distance, away form the actual gun fire and anya ctual real danger\n\nAgain, He had no gun on him and he ahd the balls to ask some cops who are trying to save people for their fucking guns, to whcih they reply for him to fuck off and they dont give a fuck who he is.\n\nThis Trust Fund Baby is such a tryhard and I cannot wait until he dies from steroid abuse.
“Oh shit, there’s a massacre going on! Turn on your camera, let’s kill the killer even though it’s dark as fucking hell and we don’t know where the gunshots are coming from! You know, there’s probably hundreds of injured people, maybe even dead, but let’s not help them but instead bother this police officer about getting his gun! Yeah, this’ll definitely help make me famous!” \n\n\nI’m assuming that’s the thought process
Lol Americans thinking this is some kind of Hollywood movie.
wow that guy in the cowboy hat seems like such a whiny little bitch who thinks hes in die hard except hes not, so he seems like an autistic weirdo who gets no pussy, love seeing losers like that xD
Why the hell does he think he's a hero? You need a bloody sniper to kill the guy.
What the actually fuck, he needs to  fuck off
Are you dumb or dumb
he doesn't come off as a coward, but he doesn't come off as a hero either, mainly cause of the image he tries hard to put of himself as a rich playboy baddass. if he didn't have that reputation and if he simply tried to help without a camera on him making sure his heroism was posted all over social media, then maybe i'd have a totally different opinion of him. as of now i can't help but to see him as a wannabe famous/hero douchebag
This video did not make me moist
This guy is just a problem.
What’s with the hat
HAHAHAHA LISTEN TO THE GUY HAVING A  GOOD OLD TIME WITH THAT GUN
This is disturbing for almost every bullet the bullet is hitting someone. You are literally hearing people dying. Well I guess I can't sleep tonight.
Well he has a whole lot of experience with huns and was trained in the military. Then again this isnt a video game and he was probably somewhat intoxicated.
It's ok, I'm a limo driver!
Surprised he didn't have another heart attack tbh.
Cop: *get the fuck away from me, I don't know you, I'm not going to give you a gun I don't even know who you are*
Why the fuck people look up to this literal sociopathic con man I will never understand.. just like the kardasashian for being in a sex tape. \nLeast she doesn't lie as much as he does tho. I don't think I've ever seen a interview with him where he didn't tell a life altering type lie. Nothing about his 'poker' career is real. Entirely fake and made up regarding starting from nothing and becoming rich in poker..after his literal stolen trust fund his father embezzled, so stole from other people. Danny boy was never heard of until he got that money, then started buying into pro level games rarely with actual pros and when it is he plays ABC type poker.. like a total novice.
Fucking dipshit runs away, then gets someone to film him coming back and asking a cop for a gun so he can somehow shoot a guy 32 stories high. Contrast this to the soldier who was pictured shielding a random stranger from bullets. Fucking ass clown.
end result: just distracted a cop for 5 seconds
You fucked up g..it is what it is.\nCondolences to all those who lost there lives. God bless and God bless America and you too Dan...
Did he say to the cop l'm a cop?
what a loser this Dan guy is.
What a twat...Filmed this for social media...He didn't help anyone when he could have...Went back 5 steps for a video...Just got in the way of some real heros. \nThe officer should've bitch slapped him.
Fuck the shooter for missing this jackass.
Did he smell the shooter like arnie did in commando haha
what a twat
What a fucking tool!

THE ULTIMATE CHAD
What a true American Hero!! The courage that man has is mind blowing. We need more brave men like him in this country!
Honestly it was a crazy time for everyone he was probably panicking and thought he could help
I make terrible YouTube videos!\nhttps://youtu.be/71mtIeBn6I8\nGo see how bad they are!!
LMAO funny the guy is like who the fuck are you bruh, i dont know u, dans be like nigga its me king of instagram
had Dan bilzerian had a gun he would've taken out the shooter I know he would've
He is a hero kind of
Should've let him help
If only more people were as heroic as dan, then maybe they could have stopped the shooter sooner. What good is a cop with an assault rifle if he's just going to run away from the danger
Dan is the man what a hero he's a true alpha male in my eyes
Calm down guys. He was trying to help, his mum is a nurse

Terorism
First he ran & you keyboard warriors called him a bitch. Then he chose to film this video because of an insecurity, given that he is someone that has built this macho reputation as well & now you guys are calling him all sorts of things. We know what building hate can result in. So just lay off the guy, what he did doesnt matter.

He made his version of Youtube Rewind, cs he wont be included in the real one. Ha!
🎶 Why all your vlogs look like Logan's? \n\n🔥 REFLECTION 🔥
Guys if you want this cancer to stop don't click on his videos you going to get an ad and let him get money if we don't click on his videos they will become less popular and he won't be trending anymore and this grown man that has a mind of a 5 year old he will become a dead channel
Why is this so well liked  :(
Actually, one of the worst years that YouTube has ever experienced. Especially with this dude trying to murder rap
i live in tulsa and i realy want that camera
I've heard of Jake Paul but now seeing one of his videos makes me want to kill him. He's a fucking bitch.
The salad he ate was gods remains
At least Hitler knew when to kill himself
I feel ashamed I was here since the start. I called this person my idol at one stage now I want him to be in prison for the rest of his life.
Make if I win my wish Will came True
All you hatter's it's nice to see you love Jake so much he's clearly on your mind all the time.💗💗💗 Love from England.

😭So sorry..
❤️
Big love xx
Oh Alix! Major hugs for you... 😭😭😭
So sorry. Take all the time you need. We'll be there. Sending all the love ♥♡♥
Oh darling. I'm so sorry. Take your time with this. People who enjoy you will be here when you are ready...xxxx.
Sending you all the love in this world, Alix! You are such a brave young girl and a true inspiration!
Losing a parent is always incredibly difficult and grieving takes time, even if the death is expected. Take time too focus on yourself, do not feel that you must create content for us. This is an exceptionally trying time for you and your family right now and you must take that time for yourselves. My condolences to yourself, your family and friends.
You take your time... I totally understand what you are going through.... take your time and go through the process.  You and your family are in my in my prays.
♥️♥️♥️ Alix, take your time and do what you need to do. I'm so sorry for your immense loss. Sending love from California.
Ohhh, dear... It is so terrible... I lost my dad because of cancer too, so I understand your feelings... It was 5 years ago but I still feel this pain... Send you my love...
Hi Alix. I have followed you for years. Don't worry about youtube. Like...really. It is just a job. Life is more important. Take your time. Do your thing. And take care of yourself.
You are so brave for sharing! Sending lots of love! ❤️
Sending you so much love and light, Alix 💕 I am so very sorry for your loss. Please know you are so loved by many, and we are here for you always, x
All the love to you darling girl! ❤️ so sorry for your loss.
Really feeling for you. Have been watching you for a long time. You should take the time you need to be with yourself, your feelings and your family. Don't worry about expectations or Youtube. Your health is very important. Sending love.
Hold on, love you and wish the best :)
Hugs... You take all the steps and time necessary to sort out the rollercoaster of emotions.
Thinking of you at this difficult time. I recently lost my Dad to Lung & Bone Cancer. He was such an amazing man, so I can completely relate. He was my Best Friend and I never imagined that he wouldn't be here to walk me down Isle one day, or to see any children I have. He loved me more than anyone in this world loved me, so I do feel a void and my life has changed forever. A lot of people would say to me, you'll be ok, it will get easier - just stay strong. But the thing is in a way you feel like you can't grieve in the way that you need to, because you should be dealing with it. So my advise to you, is to focus on yourself, grieve in your own way, and don't let anyone tell you how to feel. We all grieve differently. I am very emotional, I burst in to tears all the time. I hold on to my Dad's legacy, the things he taught me, the things he did for me, I am an ambassador of his loving kindness. My life has changed so much now, I love myself so much more than I did, I don't worry about pointless things anymore and I live life to the fullest, because we all know it's short. Once again sending my sympathies your way. Know your Mum is watching down on you and always will. Remember the good times always. Sending lots of love your way! x
💔 there's nothing any of us can say to make this pain less. Just know we are here when you feel ready xxx
Bear Hugs from Hong Kong! Although we have not met, because of YouTube, I treat you as my friend. Terrible sorry for your loss. It's so bloody hard to take the whole thing out of your life! Of course, by know your characters, I am sure your beloved mum was well-liked and beautiful. You need a break for your inner self too. It takes time but don't worry as your mum is now your guardian angel who is walking every step on the path with you. Stay strong and beautiful! Be healthy xoxoxox
you are the best thing on youtube for me. I lost my mom to cancer too not too long ago. stay strong hon, things will start looking up and you will learn to love life again. I promise. much much love!
Brave video to make. I caught this as it was trending so do not know your history but it is clear that you are torn between your online presence and your private life.\n\nTake some time out to deal with your grief and your fans will be there when you are ready.\n\nHeartfelt condolences for your loss.
I've been where you are after losing my father. And I want to tell you what a friend of mine told me after his passing that really touched my heart, I pray your mother finds peace and I pray you find it. \n\nTake care of yourself. Your mental health and well being is and should always be your priority.
I‘m sorry. You‘re wonderful.
I am so so sorry for your loss. When I clicked this video I did not expect to feel so heart broken for you. I cannot fathom how it would feel to lose my mum. Last year my grandfather passed away suddenly and for a time it took everything from me. But please, don't isolate yourself. Take a break from work if you need to and surround yourself with people who you can rely on and who you love.
hi I saw this video and was surprised, it's reached to three in trending that's impressive this is the first time I watched you BTW. Your brave to share those words out there. You must be proud of how many people have seen this because us as viewers care about you a lot and we understand now fully that your going through a rough time and now we know why you haven't uploaded it's good of you tell to us as your not hiding in the dark anymore about this. My grandad had cancer so I know how you feel It was hard me too. Every day will get better and better along the way, it sounds like your mum was your rock because you have a bond that you don't have with anyone else. Stay strong and carry on your life to the fullest because you shouldn't think about the worst things in life even if you have to as it might make your day even worse. I hope you feel better soon Emily x
This is my first ever comment on a YT video.  It was really hard to watch.  I am an old lady in my fifties and I lost my amazing mum to breast cancer when I was in my early 30s.  You are absolutely right it is a shitty situation and will continue to be so for some time yet.  Grief is totally unpredictable and you will feel how you feel.  Don’t listen to anyone who says you ‘should’ be doing a certain thing or ‘should’ be feeling a certain way - this is your grief and it will be as it is.  Give yourself time and be kind to yourself.  Cry when you want to; rage when you need to and smile when you can. Talk to a professional if you find you have no one who can be objective. It won’t feel like it now but I promise it will get better.  The great emptiness doesn’t really go away - there are some days even now when I miss her more than I can say and feel jealous and resentful of those who still have access to their Mum - but I am so grateful that she was my Mum and the love she gave to me and that love and the memories of her are what I treasure most.  Her love is with you and always will be xx
Nothing anyone can say will make you feel better. Take the time that you need and no we will be here for you when you return.
wishing you the best
I lost my dad at 14 so I know how you feel. You do what you feel is right hun and give yourself time x
sending lots of love from USA!
I’m so sorry to hear that Alix. Sending lots of love. Take your time.
I am sorry for your loss. I can see the pain & loss you feel in your eyes. Someone as young as you should never have to go through the pain you are in. I send you gentle hugs. 💜
Nobody should ever make you feel like you owe it to them to publically display your grief. You do not owe anybody the right to your private life, what you document on YouTube is a choice and not an obligation. Take care of yourself and seek comfort wherever you can, we'll still be here when you're ready to come back ❤❤❤❤
I am really, truly sorry for you, Alix. Take your time, we will be patiently awaiting your return.
I can't imagine what you're going through but all the love and good vibes are being sent your way 💙💙
Oh my heavens. I'm so sorry for your loss, Alix. Sending you good thoughts and prayers❤️
My thoughts are with you Alix 💗 Stay strong and reach out if you ever need to talk ✨
I never comment on videos but I feel I have to comment on this one. I cried with you throughout this video not just because I empathise with your grief but because seeing someone feel they have to share it when they don't want to was heartbreaking. I just wanted to let you know that there are many more of us nice folk out here who normally don't comment but who are rooting for you. The few damaged individuals who feel the need to be vicious online may be very vocal but they are not the majority, they are the minority. Your job right now is to grieve and help your family grieve, nothing else. I didn't know your mum but I feel quite sure she would be very proud of how you handled this x
I'm so sorry  I hope you feel better very soon ❤️
I don't know you, and I've never seen one of your videos before this one somehow popped up. But I am so sorry for your loss. I know it does nothing for your pain, but I felt it should be said. I will pray for you, and wish you well.
i lost my mom to cancer when i was in high school, almost 8 years ago now. do what you need to do, feel what you need to feel. thinking of you <3
I'm so sorry for your loss!! God Bless you and your family!
Me too going through same situation. My dad also passed away a week ago. He was suffering from heart disease and all of a sudden two weeks ago after dinner when we were having a good night greet before sleep, he got brain stroke. We rushed him to hospital and did the treatments in ICU. but couldn't get him back home all well. We tried,wish to try more and he also fought the situation till last. But the cruel 'time' won at \nlast. I wish we had some more time together to fulfil his desires . some more days to cherish together. Some more memories with him. I will never in my life forget his tears when he sees us while he was in hospital when we visit him in ICU. i wish you heaven and peace in soul dad. Please shower your blessing on us forever. God please take care of my beloved DAD and give me strength to fulfil his dreams and make him proud. love you dad. You ain't dead. Just too far from me that we cannot see. But for sure we gonna meet one day. Om nama shivaya.
Sending my deepest condolences for the loss of your mother. I know what it is to loose a parent. If this helps in any possible way, always remember, she may have left her body but she'll never leave you. You will find her in all the things and people you love, she will continue to give you gifts throughout your life... you just have to look for them and know they're from her.
I am sorry for you lost 🙏🏻😞 keep strong, we ll wait for you.
Alix I am so sorry for your loss
so sorry for you loss. stay strong. sending all my love to you and your family ❤
Alex I am so sorry to hear that! Cancer runs in so many families including mine. It’s scary and I can’t imagine what you are going through with it being someone so close to to you. Prayers with u and your family!
I don’t even know what to say. I’m so so sorry. I’m so sorry. Sending love.
Really sorry for your lost. I can’t even imagine what are you going through but I can only say that shell be taking care of you and present in your life always.  All my love to you in these difficult time
I appreciate this not being a bullshit clickbait video. I'm sure you've also thought about feeling bad for making profit from this topic, but it'll help people going through the same thing.
i think you should return whenever you feel inspired to make a video again. i cannot even imagine the pain you feel in your heart, body and soul. i don’t expect any content from you on the regular. and neither should anyone else. of course your followers are delighted to see you when you upload, but it should never be expected!! i’m sorry you feel that pressure. you are so strong, Alix...... your lil community loves you!!
I am so sorry for your loss.  My heart breaks for you.  I lost my mother to breast cancer last November and lost my father to cancer six years ago.  I prayed after my mother passed away that no other family would ever have to lose a loved one to that horrible disease.  I gladly wanted to be the last human to lose a parent to cancer if I could spare anyone else the same pain.  Take all the time you need to grieve.  I can tell you that raw aching wound that you feel now will start to heal.  It will never go away, but it does become bearable.  It is a cliche for a reason, but time will help you heal.  There will be moments when a friend, loved one or family member will say just the right thing at the right moment that will make the pain go away for a fleeting second.  I hope you have many of those moments because they are what gets you through the initial grief.  The first year is the worst because there are so many first occasions to live through and mark.  You will feel like they will break you and you can't go on.  They will pass and you will gain strength and endure.  Cry when you need to, ask for hugs, spend time with your puppy.  The love of an animal can heal almost anything.  My cats helped me so much during those first awful weeks and months.  I want to let you know that you will get through this.  The raw pain you feel will ease.  You will get be able to think about your mother one day without wanting to cry.  I hope I can give you hope that it won't always be like this.  Take care and sending you a big hug.
Oh, Alix. I don’t comment a ton on videos, either, but I want to say that I’m so very sorry for the losses and for the pain you’re in.

Alix I am so so sorry for your loss. I am happy you kept your privacy - you deserve to have that. Hang in there, and again I am so so sorry.
I am so sorry for your loss, Alix. My heart goes out to you during this time. And no explanation is ever needed, it is your life and you have the right to share as much or as little as you want. My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Sending you prayers and hugs from Texas. I lost my mom when I was in college and it’s a loss that’s beautifully unique but profoundly hard to explain. Wishing you all the comfort possible. Xoxo
I'm so sorry for your loss.  I lost my Mom 8 years ago and it is a huge missing space in your heart.  Praying for you.
We are all very sorry for your loss. Please let us surround you with 394,000 collectives hugs. For all that you have provided to us, we send our love to you and your family.
Hey this is the first time watching your videos and I'm just here tearing up, I'm so sorry for your loss, I recently lost a friend and I know how difficult it is during these times, but you gotta keep on keeping on. My heart goes out to you and I pray you have the close friends you need by your side during these tough times, much luv Jon.
You are so incredibly brave, you never ever ever owe anyone an explanation. Look after yourself lovely, big hugs xxx

My heart goes out to you Alix. Sending you so much love xx
I am truly sorry for your loss, sending good energy your way <3
I'm very sorry for your loss. My deepest condolences❤️
Alix I know I am a stranger on the internet but I just want to give you a hug.\nMy mom got diagnosed with lung cancer in May and it's since spread to her brain. She's not the person she used to be and I feel like her time is extremely limited. She just finished her fifth round of chemo. It's so hard to see someone who used to care for you whenever you were sad, and now you feel so helpless. Well at least I do. I'm sending you lots of love and solidarity. #fuckcancer
I'm so sorry. Self care is so important. You don't owe any of us anything. My mother is failing.  I still have her. She is ill, so she has changed from who she was. You were very lucky to have each other. She was lucky to have you. I'm really sorry.
Take all the time you need. we all support and love you.
So brave of you to do this! Lots and lots of prayers are with you! So sorry for your loss! ❤️ can't imagine what you're going through
god bless u and everyonewhos commented & lost someone. my mom has als and my father has a bad heart. stay strong.
Stay strong and try to keep happy ❤️ i can't imagine what you're going through but you've got thousands of people who've got your back, so take all the time you need to lean back on this safety net because we've got you .
I am absolutely heart broken for you. Please take care of yourself and do what you need to do for you. We'll all be here when you are ready to return if that's what you choose to do. Much love to you and your family xx
My God give you strength in this time,  you are not alone in this!  <3
Sending you love and comfort.. take your time, grief is a process and we will still be here when you are ready to return xo
my heart bleeds for you . I know how it is to lose  a mother . most importantly because we need our mom's as young girls . I pray that God give you strength . I love you Alix from Nonto in South Africa (Africa)
I know your pain.  I have lived it.   One day at a time, one hour at a time, one breath at a time.....keep going.
You don't owe anyone any part of you. I am so incredibly sorry for your loss. You are wonderful and kind and I wish you and your family so much love in this time.
Who the hell has the audacity to downvote this video ? What is wrong with you people ? This girl is poring he heart and feelings out after this tragic loss and you downvote ? You should be ashamed of yourselves terrible human beings !

I'm 28 (supposedly tech savvy) I'm in a social media black out. I don't believe in telling the world your every move. This.... slightly different. I don't know you but I feel like I do, the way you opened up to (me) the wider community. I'm glad that this helps you pet. If it helps, I'm here and I'm listening. As are we all. Good luck to you. That's all I can give, over you tube xxxx
Its 4am in the morning and ive found this video, and Im sat here in tears because your pain is so palpable :(\nMy mum is exactly the same with my videos, my instagram posts, she texts me to let me know if ive had a mean comment or just to let me know that she loved one of my photos. I dont know how it must feel not to have that anymore, i cant even imagine and i dont want to - Youre so strong to even sit down infront of the camera and string together sentences.\nSending a thousand huge hugs xo
1:56 Graham made a Robert Downey Jr reaction
Idris makes the foot fetish seem cool.
*Everyone take your shoes off!* 😂😂😂 So cute and so on point! 👌
If your socks still on,  it ain't cheating!  - Tracy Morgan
Chris Rock! That's no excuse. Hilarious.
I love Chris Rock, his one liners and his laugh always crack me up!
Idris Elba and Chris Rock on a couch... damn too much awesomeness
Idris needs to do a movie with Tarantino.
Kate is so gorgeous
Kate Winslet still looks amazing ✨
Graham, don't drink your wine! There's a fly!
The chemistry of these three tonight is great!
All three are great actors!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Love I love how he kind of pulled his hand back, he knows his wife is watching!
What the... did Kate Winslet get...... hotter?
Has Winslet done surgeries on her face? I didn't recognize her to begin with!
Ok I already liked Elba as an actor, but I just noticed his hand tattoo I totally didn't know he had, just hours after I got my hand tattoo aaand he just admitted havin a foot fetish, which I also have, on national tv looking cool as hell, Elba just turned into one of my fav celebrities lol
“You know how I feel about feet!” “Bunion” - Junior Soprano
I thought i was the only one with a foot fetish
I would never have guessed that Chris is older than Idris.
im so glad luther is returning for season 5
Shoutout to all the ladies getting a pedicure after this.
The guy literally directed a short for Sky which was centred around a woman and her love of shoes because he likes feet that much. The signs are all there haha
Idris I want your baby
Did anyone else search Kate Winslet feet before the video even finished playing?
He's going to get so many feet pics slid into his dm
I can not say  it often enough - I LOVE  Idris
If you don't know what Chris Rock meant by 'Hammertime' watch this and all will be revealed https://youtu.be/NP7_SIRfo-c
I think Kate Winslet is a bit of diva.
You can tell Idris can't stand Kate and to tell her to keep her socks on really shows the lack of chemistry considering he loves nice feet. From how bossy Kate is I can tell why he doesn't like her.
I love Kate's hair!!!!
I respect Idris Alba even more now..\nUs feet lovers have to stick together lol
BrokeBLACK Mountain, with Chris Rock and Idris Elba
Idris 💙
Kate winslet mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Idris is my boy and Kate looks great. Chris is the one true rock.
Hey, there's a thing I and Idris Elba have in common.
Off topic, I had no clue that Idris Elba appeared in Space Precinct.
there´s a fly on Graham´s glass
I guess it's not cheating if she has her socks on. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
That's no excuse lmao I crying
I'm a simple person. I see Idris, I click.
how is the title different in the sub list than this screen.
Anyone else notice the fly on Graham’s glass?
Omg the things I would do to Kate.
Who else noticed the fly on Graham's wine glass?
Who else noticed the fly in the wine glass?
The Best sex seen - http://elisesmith.pagedemo.co
What I learned from this is that Chris Rock wants Idris Elba to bang him
Yes, but the HORSE FLY ON GRAHAM'S WINE GLASS :07 - :10 I just CAN'T! Wasn't there an episode a while back where an actor swallowed a fly? Wasn't it Chris O'Dowd in 2013 with Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig? Graham, what's with the flies in your studio?!
Did idris and Chris coordinate wardrobe?
This theme reminds me of the We Saw Your Boobs song, poor Kate
0:07 THERE'S A FLY ON HIS DRINK!
I want to see this whole episode.
This is the best Trio that has ever been assembled on the Graham Norton Show
Not once will they ask her about the fact that Rose killed Jack it would really be interesting to see her explain herself or her character. I'd just like to see her opinion.
Great now I know there is a sex scene.  They ruined the movie.  I'm not going now
Woahhhhhh.  She grabbed his hand and he leaned away.....
i love feet and i guess i can understand why he didnt want to see her's , it would be to distracting/arousing
Just found out Chris Rock is 52 years old. Bit of a shock for me.
There's this one shower scene though...Loni can tell you all about it.
Chris Rock is 52 years old
Thank god he doesnt have an armpit fetish like some weirdoes. A feet fetish is harmless enough, I guess
These 3 had brilliant chemistry together
i dunno...still think Idris is faking that accent...
There's a fly in Graham Norton's wine glass at 0.07
Idris: I've done a lot of films where there are a lot of guys.\nChris Rock: That's no excuse.  \n\nSmart and funny - LOL!
Guys, he's only human
Chris rock just announced he likes men 😂
Titanic, Quills, Little Children, The Reader.. I'm sure I'm missing a few
idris released Kate's hands because he communicates by gesturing
Kate fine as HELL... 🔥 🔥
Hammertime feet - Yes Chris! Boomerang reference!
SHE. DID. THAT.
Green Lantern!!!!
Martyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
hello
Clickbait
Idris for 007!
Winslet is great.
Chris Rock is 52
Idris Elba 😍
http://colonizer.creativerobot.co/visit/?player=3B2E6PR0346HGZ3OXU73
Hahah Eddie Murphy Boomerang Film check it out.
I love Kate
🔥Become super Beautiful 🔥 \nhttps://youtu.be/Kuyz4jlA8HI\n⚡⚡🔥🔥🔥⚡⚡🔥🔥🔥⚡⚡
Kate (Rose) you had enough room to get Leo (Jack) on that damn door in Titanic Jack didn't have to die dammit.
Idris and Chris can broke black mountain!!! :)
I can not date a woman with feet i dont LIKE ....i dont care how amazing her face or body is
dude her feet in not that sexy but they R quite attractive for someone whos into feet .,.\nand she is bossy so you get the picture those with the feet thing ,,,wink  ,.,.
This man better be the next James bond
just took my socks off!  c;mon Idris!  Im waiting!
*_And on this day Idris Elba's Twitter account got flooded with pics of women's bare feet._*  #IdrisElbaHasAFootFetish 😁 😍 💕 ❤
I bet he has another foot in his trousers.
Idris loves feet.
When Kate Winslet grabed his hand?! So cuteeee😍😍
I want to suck your toes Kate
if i meet Idris Elba one day i'll accidentally take off my shoes
Idris Elba should be the next Bond. Who's with me?
Foot fetishes are disgusting. FEET ARE DISGUSTING!
I watch ASMR with earphones is that bad?
HAHAHA! Waking up worrying if my head phones still work! While i'm unraveling them.
These are why I have an iPad 😂
Great video. so funny :'D
This is so true but id rather have these than the struggles of Not watching asmr
I don't know why this was in my recommended. This felt like a really long Vine.
Was only subbed to fairychar. I have found my new girlfriend. I love you seeetheart.
Omfg why is this like 100% me?!😂😂
so relatable the ad thing was so relatable i hat when that happens to me
Or when u wake up with a kink in your neck
I relate to all of them 100% 😭😂💕💕
Well atleast i know I'm not alone anymore xD
Wow... you got fatter! Your face looks a bit chuby
This was great 👍🏼 I liked the nooo.....nooo...NOOOOO ... at the end
Her “No” at the end was so cute lol
This is by far the most relatable thing ever. Oh my god 😂
That was pretty funny...and scarily close to home. \n\nAlso, how do you sleep in that bed???  That creaking would drive me nuts!!
8 on trending right behind Jake paul, how do you feel now
lol the last part
I have a story. One day my sister tells me avoiding my eyes hey at night, I hear asmr I was  😲 shock. I ask why at night? 🤔That  when she open the world of asmr of  sleep. Than she tells me she feels so weird that she deleted her history. So than one night I did the same. Now it's been months. Also I tend to delete my search and watch history. Still love you though. You were my first to this, thank you 😙 also can relate to all of this. Just not hearing it in the morning.
Could someone tell me the song used in the beginning?
The way u said no at the end was so cute :)))
oh u a funny girl now huh?
i had an ear infection for a week and i swear it was the most sleepless week i’ve had
My only struggles: being strangled by my headphones, and falling asleep when I don't want to.
she's hit the big time now. trending #5 on youtube!
I can relate to all of these
I would give a back rub everyday
When you can't find the right position - ROTFLMAO.
Congrats on 6th place trending keep up the good work
This is so true!
You nailed all of those but one !....the one where your using one hand to hold the phone and it slips out of your hand and hits you/or your girlfriend in the face or head but other wise 100% asmr darling
am i the only one who watches asmr on my laptop in bed
i have never been triggered by ASMR, it's sad beacuase it sounds like fun...
These are too true
That advertisement one is sooooo accurate 😂😂😂😭😭
This is very true
Trust no bitch who’s wallpaper is one of the stock Apple ones 🤦🏼‍♀️
One of the reasons why i watch your videos is because i just love when you say asmr Darling 🔥💓
Do u know how old she is ? Just wondering
This is too on point. Also 👉🏼😎👉🏼 you're trending I'm so happyyyy!
Okay. I got it up. Let's watch it, girl. Dont take that out of context.
That's why I have a portable charger
Wireless head phones do exist and you can watch on vr device 🤣🤣😂
The one with the “can’t find the right position and the forget to charge your phone”  always happen to me😂
Welcome to my Life
I have never related to a video more
Ads at the end of asmr HAS TO GO i agree lol.
I'm getting tingled from this video too what is wrong with me ????
OMG I also watch a lot PJ dreams
sleep sleep. YOU NEED A WEBSITE? WHY NOT DO IT YOURSELF? WITH WIX YOU CAN CREATE YOUR OWN PROFESSIONAL WEBSITE!
deleted is more of a YouTube thing in general
I haven't laughed that hard in a long time! Thank you!
All of them are me! Most often finding the right position and waking up to nearly being chocked to death by my headphones!!!!!!
Jajaj the first one Its exactly what happened to me. XD
Isn't ASMR the name of a gun in Call of Duty?
Nothing has ever been so relatable in my life.
i’ve never wore headphones while listening to amsr... i feel like if i do then i’ll never be able to go back 😭😂
Omg I've definitely tapped on my hairspray bottle and all my makeup before
*Sleep, sleep, sleep. Have a good night everyone.* “dO YOU NEED CAR INSURANCE?”

Why does Jimmy always seem bothered when his guests do something semi-naughty? He looked pissed when Miley slapped her own butt. Lol

Miley looks so beautiful, and that body!!! OMG

Gal has no talent or a brain and sounds like a man
Miley look like she can't walk in them heels

Gal Gadot is the Woman of the Year, 2017.
What is wrong with Miley? I used to be her biggest fan before she cut her hair and went psycho.
2:43 when the old Miley kicks in
Magnificent style. Great job celebrities on this game. Nicely done.

What colour do you have on your nails Tanya? It looks like the perfect light pink
Your jumper with the stripes on the sleeves has a Gryffindor kind of vibe. Haha
It's an opera cake!! Love those !
OMG I WATCHED GYPSY TELL US WHAT U THINK ABOUT IT WHEN UR DONE
Does anyone what the sparkly app is?
Please, can you tell me the style and brand of those sunglases you wore in 11:20? I'm obsessed! 😍
Hi (sorry for my bad english)

Louis Vuitton have invited me to their show meanwhile I'm the only one in my year that doesn't get invited shopping or to parties 😂😂

You looked so good in both dresses😻😻
Tanya: Where do your American fans buy your makeup products? Do you plan to sell in America at anytime soon? Long time fan anxiously awaiting !! :D
I'm loving the lipstick colour at 12:31.. Does anyone know the name of the colour??
Tanya’s french accent reminds me of Blair Waldorf (Gossip Girl) when she was in Paris😍
What’s the app that makes everything sparkly?! I need it!
I went to Paris a couple months ago and I pretty went to every place but the Louis Vuitton store xx
I love your videos sooo much Tan

Would love to know the name of the lipstick that was worn with that black dress. Such a lovely colour.

OMG!! What is the name of that shop that has all of GLOSSIER??\nI need to go there
Can anyone please tell me what the sparkly app is?
I've always wondered if she gets to keep the dresses and handbags or if she has to return it - anyone else know?
WHERE IS THAT TRACK FROM DURING THE MONTAGE OF THE VIEW FROM THE TRAIN WINDOW!!!!
People will probably think I'm stupid for this but how did she get to Paris on the train
Good
I would think that with Paris just across the channel and a train that takes you there so quickly, loads of Londoners would be criss crossing for short getaways a few times a year and not just once in a few years.
Bisping interviews are like looking at a wall
Only a complete knob would want Michael Bisping to win, I hope GSP drops this mofo
Michael Bisping is going to get fucked
Rose is gonna fuck up Joanna I see it in her eyes. Just ask Michelle Waterson smh
I'm rooting for Joanna <3. I can't wait to see you fight again, Champ.
This is really awkward
I, I, I, I'm not impressed by your drunken performance.
Michael Bisbing is too real for YouTube
We all remember how Johny Hendricks gave a face care to GSP so the end here is pretty clear
man i know bisping was pretty outspoken but i honestly feel like he's trying his best to sell this fight like mcgregor would.... i mean, trashing what he's wearing? that's something out of mcgregor's book...
Bisping: So when did being an arrogant egomaniac douche become a part of martial arts??
only 280k views in 3 days......
UFC has become about acting and putting on a WWE performance WTF!! and to top it off, shit fights everytime.
Bisping is an animal! Always a pleasure to listen to the smack.
how many bottles of fake tan did TJ Dillashaw use for this press conference?
GPS the new middleweight champion
Bisping is pathetic. I wouldnt be shocked if he thinks about Conor when hes poppin Viagra with his wife. Next hell be trying to box.
Say bye bye to the belt Bisping
MMA, Mixte Martials Arts. St-Pierre always has this notion of respect, it is a martial artist. Bisping has no respect, he's a jester. Respect is one of the bases of every martial art, then respect Georges St-Pierre!
GSP better clatter his ugly fucking head RIGHT OFF of the canvas multiple times.
Bisping is cringing he's just trying to copy Connor but he's not even funny. Sad
Guess who's the wanna be Macgregor
man...... everyone is trying to be conor 2.0
joanna is pretty hot, I'd love too fuck her 😍
They did this again?
So very medieval -- grow up dudes - childhood is over.
Bispings trash LOL his whole UFC career is garbage hahahahaj
Go thug rose
Are you in-tox-it-k-ted... are you in-tox-it-k-ted?
GSP!!
Let's go gsp
TJ is so damn tan.
Bossing is fucked up lol still funny
Dudes are outdated chump
polish slave
Bisping really likes to instigate trouble lol
I kinda feel bad for GSP
Bisping: Aree Yuuuu Eeentoxicaytedddd - Ohhh fuck my sides 😂
Rose Laundry Day Namajunas.
hes gonna fill them holes
Namagoonus
GSP will win for sure, how many lucky wins and how many controversial wins are der in Kissbings career!! Countless.. Yes GSP had his controversies as well, whatever the case maybe GSP is better skilled and raw power house, he will fuck Kissbing on Nov 4th (no fucking doubt)
Bisping's like 15 year old League of Legends gamers. xD The most cringe-worthy flame ever.
Michael bisping is a fraud man, Anderson Silva fucked him up and lost somehow. Dan henderson fucked him up and still lost somehow. Fair enough he beat Luke rockhold but that was more Luke messing up himself. His reign as champion is just not warranted   . Also fighting someone who’s just come out of retirement to prove what?
These press conferences are getting cringe worthy. If Woodley hadn't put us to sleep he would've got that fight. Stfu bisping
Bisping, one of the most unlikable people in the world, ashamed he's a Brit.\nHope he gets destroyed.
Bisping cant win if the fight dont take place in the UK
I wanna fight with your chicken!! #KhabibTime
Don't underestimate bisping.. most his losses are to roid heads
Love Bisping.  Great for the sport, needs characters.
bisping should keep a note of of the things that he says,damn! it's worth a million dollars😂😂
DJ is going to win easy! #mightymouse!
Bisping delusional as always.\nThe only one who's gonna miss you when you're finally gone is Dana you fucking pussy.
I love the way Bisping mimics GSP when his first language isn't English, yet Bisping was born in England and has disgusting broken English due to his derro accent.
Bitchping got owned in the first exchange....and your probably drunk like last time...1-0 GSP so far
if theres any CHILDREN here if at first you dont succeed try and try again. Its not if at first you dont succeed fuckin run off and cry like a little bitch... Bisping you are talking to the children.
Bisping's trash talk is way more crisp than connor's.\nGSP: Bisping is not happy. He has a hole he needs to fill \nBISPING: You''d like that huh George. Fill them holes up
i'm always in fighting shape Tell that to Yoel Romero!
I was already sick of listening to Conor McGregor now I have to listen to Bisping rehash an unintelligent impression of the Irishman. Michael is drunk and has one eye for God sake! He'll be lucky if he escapes this fight with what little vision he still has in check. But the trying to imitate Conor is so pathetic. Bisping is the luckiest fighter in UFC history because the truth is he got knocked down twice in his second outing against a 40 year plus Hendo and squeaked by with a home town judges decision, and Anderson kicked his teeth back behind his tonsils and still he somehow won a decision (I believe because Anderson didn't really care anymore). Michael was twice as beaten after his fight against Anderson than George was after Hendricks. bis PING! was and is nothing more than a lucky TUF season winner, period. He can't even quarrel well.
This year has been great for the ufc.... great fights this year
Georges looks like a lizard? They're among us?
Thug Rose just looked straight through Joanna! Gonna be a great fight on a great card!
Bisping so unprofessional, keeps butting in all the time. Making fun of freddie? Cmon man
This card is fucking awesome so far
Why is there a fcken thumb in between the fighters?
imagine if bitchspring loses his sight in the fight
I like Bisping, dude is a beast, and a true fighter! Hope he wins and retires on top!
how come they already have press conference for 217 when there's no conference for 216? what kind of stupid shit is that? this is the second press conference for bisping and gsp, fucking clowns
Tj ain't pulling that suit off.
Can't wait for GSP to return
If there was a time for Joanna to KO someone it's now
Well of course Bisping would have had to fight either Romero or Whittaker because it was for the interim title. Does the Champ have the option to evade the Interim title holder, I dont think so.
I really hope Rose give JJ a war
I didn't know you could actually shit out your mouth, but Bisping proved me wrong. This dude is an asshole on FOX Sports 1, any time he fights an opponent he has no respect or anything. I can't believe anyone could be a fan of this guy.
Man Bisping always the funniest guy at a press conference.
Bisping - Being real.\nGeorge - Lost the fight before it even started.
gsp got big.or ped.......
Bisbing the Badby
No one will miss Bitchping
bisping sunglasses??
What if GSP beats Bisping? Will he still talk fuckin' trash? Prob not.
17:30 fuckin hell😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bisping trying to be mcgregor
GSP at 20:20, jesus christ
Hope GSP grounds and pounds that asshole!
Michael Bisping thinks he's Conor McGregor 😂
YEHHHHH BISPING TELL THESE\nFUKERS!!!!! BISPING SHALL DESTROY GSP COME ON ENGLAND!!!!!!!
bisping is the most annoying dude ever
I feel bad 4 GSP :)))
Lol Bisping brought up ze aliens
Gsp win ggwp
Demitrious Johnson : Im so scared of TJ Dillashaw I want to keep my belt im not fighting him !!!!!
I just want GSP and Cody to win.
Sad we didn't get to see Cody and TJ talk a lot
Rose seems like she's on another level of not caring about all this. She just wants to fight. I expect a war.
JJ's English improved so freaking much. It's like from 3 words to a whole spectrum and huge confidence & near fluently in speaking. She works extremely hard both on and off the octagon. #AndSTILL! :)
Bisping\nGarbrandt\nJoanna
Everything Bisping said is true
Bunch of arrogant assholes with belts I never root for these wankers, always for the challengers go gsp.
Rose looks like 11 from stranger things.
4:49 se didn't do that what do ya think meme
She’s so sweet, I love how you’re so willing to learn 👌
Does anyone know what lip product Nicol used and what color?
Cristine is so beautiful omg if I didn't know who she actually was she would totally pass off as a beauty guru to me
“Ok.... STOP” who are you? Ethan bradberry? Spider-Man? Elsa?
Anyone else think she looked like saffron barker on the thumbnail?😂
NOBODY WANTED A FUCKING FACELOGICAL VIDEO, WE JUST CAME FOR THE PEEL PORN CHRISTINE
What is the song at 10:55
Cristine is the queen literally
Oh I love this, but how can Nicole not have a cooler contour color or a foundation to lend Kristine😅?\nBut it's much more fun this way 😂 and yeah the setting spray is wet! No shit 😆 love you!
These colours are a little too dark for Cristine ))
I don't know about you guys, but I think Cristine's very pretty without make-up on...
WERES .........\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n💿          💿  💿💿💿💿  💿          💿💿💿💿\n💿          💿  💿         💿  💿           💿         💿\n💿💿💿💿  💿          💿 💿           💿         💿\n💿          💿  💿         💿  💿           💿         💿\n💿          💿  💿💿💿💿  💿💿💿 💿💿💿💿\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou perv why are you here for😎
is it bad that i have no idea who Nicole is?
I didn't know who the collab was with and I thought it was mylifeaseva
Is it just because i have hooded eyes, or does other’s people’s eye shadow rub off the main part of the eye and gather in the crease as one thick line of eye shadow. I just had that happen to me today and wiping it off was horrifying and yet hilarious.
Nicole is like a pro and Cristine is like a kid playing with her mom's makeup and she cant reach foundation and beauty blender LOL
the contour was still garbage
i wish Christine make a hair color tutorial !
What is the song in 10:58
I have the same scar
When will you update nail art videos? It’s been a while.. The last one was the youtubers nail art. I was expecting more
my first though on Nicol was that she was a unicorn. A very beautiful unicorn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIm so sorry if this comment offended you in anyway.
I think it would be a great video if u would go makeup shopping with someone😂
I super like your humor!!!!!!!! Omggg i just watched this and i'm a subscriber right away!!! ❤❤😂😂😂
I love how christine make everyone laugh
Now That Halloween is coming can you do holo vampire teeth💎💎
Christine. you're just so damn cute. but totally savage! girrrrrl!
Noooo the contour is too orange for you😭😭
I've been saying we'll be holo instead of we'll be golden because holo is more important than gold.
i went to an amusement park and 5 people talked to me because of my, HOLO ITS ME shirt. They said they love you too and are jealous. 😂
I feel like every collab she's ever done was with people that don't really wanna be with her but do it for the views but this girl Is lowkey a fan. She looks really happy to be there with her and I find that so sweet. Unlike Tati, who you can really tell doesnt care that much about anyone but herself at all.
Can you please do a magnetic polish video i know its old new but its so awesome also add the holo i really wanna see 👀
At 10:43 when Cristine said oh my god it's wet my phone glitched and it repeated what she just said and it went black then it reseted itself lmao I don't know what just happened
Ay where’s the one with nikkie
You should see the other guy...The other guy's a desk.
Contour? More like can't-tour. Failure
This collab was amazing! The vibe was so chill and natural. Nicol is so nice and sweet. You can tell she is genuine ❤️
Christine, I think you're already beautiful person!
Do the next episode with christen dominique😍😍😍😍😍
her jaw can cut me anytime. I volunteer
When you think about putting one of the quotes from something she said that made you laugh but the whole video made you laugh
Remember the supposed scorpion nail trend from a few years ago? http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/10/21/scorpion-manicure_n_12589416.html You should do something like that next, except maybe with make plastic ones or something considering using real ones might be dangerous or something.
Those colors look nice on you Cristine!!
The other girl  looks like  she has a mushtach
YES MY GIRL IS ON *TRENDING* I FEEL SO PROUD

Hey!! Can anyone please tell me what song is it @ 10:52 ?
no way christine  could live in Australia because there is no STARBUCKS
Bronze goddess... ? No, that's orange...
Personal question, how do you shave the pubicare in your buttcrack? I am honest to god not that flexible.
Can you please roast your old nails
too much makeup and in the way wrong color
Why do her lips look like that? Gross
This girl looks like she has had so much plastic surgery. I like watching Cristine because is so natural.
She loves the cream 😂😂😝😝😏😏😏😏
Cristine you do not need makeup because you are beautiful just the way you are inside or out do not listen to haters and mean people please take my advice I am not trying to get a shoutout I just want to tell you always be yourself you are beautiful just the way you are!
This woman next to Cristin has awful lips
You should make a series called simply slimelogical\n\n\n\n\nThis is a joke btw
nicole did you WRONG with that orange contour stick
QUACK QUACK DUCK LIPS
I hate when ppl try to put themselves down and try to make it funny :\
1:23 plastic and beautiful and professional👌🏻, if u wear makeup u look plastic, not natural. This is my pet hate when people call it natural. Ppl still look beautiful though!
So many legends here Feeling Excited  I don't care Atlantic Records buy youtube views from *AUTHENTIC* *Views* *dot* *com*
And the Macedonians will pray for Puerto Rico
Nothing, and I mean nothing, compares to We Are The World. This song doesn't even come close. Like the point behinde it, but kinda sucks as a song
Keep it trending so it gets more views, more hits, more downloads, more attention, more money, more disaster relief effort :)
His voice meshes very well with Camila’s. I think she’s the youngest singer on the track. Unless there’s someone younger than her on here.
please sub to my channel.i ll sub to yours.
Dear Dotards pressing the dislike button, how pathetic can you be spreading your negativity to a song meant to uplift and aid people in need. Reassess your life. If your obsession with Trump can't be helped, at least leave people who want to do something good be.
DANIEL SALAZAR FROM FEAR THE WALKING DEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh gosh he was flat on that last note
the rythms, the beats\nthis song's amazing!
Nowtv a 30 second advert that I can’t skip .... really
Honestly, I can't really understand anything except for Puerto Rico and it's almost like praying because it's all in Spanish and I can't speak Spanish, but you can just hear the passion and feel the power in those words and it is just so, so moving. It's beautiful. It's brilliant. ❤
Jane the Virgin's Gina Rodriguez got to rap her part. What a cool song.
I remember when this guy played on House MD for a couple episodes
I can feel the passion in this song and I absolutely love it. Will be buying this immediately \nPraying for all of the lives effected by the hurricane and for the responders to help in anyway possible. \n\nSending love to Puerto Rico from Chicago!

This is ART! I love this song so much i think it's amazing
Oh my god it’s beautiful
See, what none of you are realising is that Puerto Rico is an island. Which means its surrounded by.. Water.. Lots of water.. Ocean water and don't get me wrong it's a big ocean.. But OK listen you guys have.. Thrown our budget way outta wack. Our budget was fine before Puerto Rico.. So just remember to.. Have a good time.
AHHHH HEARING A. RAMOS SING IN SPANISH MADE ME DO A DOUBLE TAKE I DIDN'T K N O W

This made me very emotional...🇵🇷 Still haven't heard from our family in Utuado...🙏🏼
LIN IS THE PUREST IN THIS WORLD FOR MAKING THIS POSSIBLE ❤️🇨🇺
Check out this app 👉 https://sweatco.in/hi/wil181433 ... It pays for walking
I thought I was hearing stuff when I heard the Coqui, but no. Wow. You legit put the sound of Puerto Rico's nature as the melody.

The coqui at the end 😔👌🏼🇵🇷
YESSSSSSS
Puerto Rico Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 la amo como el coqui soy boricua hasta fin dentro de mi corazón ❤️ Puerto Rico se levanta con más fuerza 👍
Orocovis presente bendiciones a mi isla bella y a mexico tambien dale
Lo que estamos sufriendo en nuestra bella isla. La gente de puerto rico sigue de pie.. Tenemos buen corazon.. Nos amamos. Aun con la crisis seguimos cuerdos
Me encantó la canción sin embargo desperdiciaron la voz más hermosa que es la de Camila Cabello ella da para más, lindo gesto sólo que también México está mal y a muchos les dolió que el apoyo de sus ídolos sólo sea para puerto rico.
You're as inhumane as Trump is,  if you don't feel this.
Wow a celebrity did more for Puerto Rico in 24 hours than the US president who I will not mention.....
Better than Despacito amirite?
*Nice to see Puerto Rico copy the American flag* 😩
God punished Puerto Rico because Lin-Emanuel disrespected President Trump and Vice-President Pence.
Really smh snake ass camila instead of Becky g?
Why is the UPSIDE-DOWN CROSS on the flag. Don't trust them sinners beware satan mimics God in many ways, it's for the poor right. It's masonic music through the federation. Who's in the federation, the masons.
Someone commented saying Mexican culture is boring like bitch tf every culture is fun in its own way. Get yo negative trump lookin ass outta here.
I'm a simple person.\nI see Lin Manuel Miranda I click.
Do these idiots think they're helping by making a shit song? Go send money and aid instead of making this shit...
Look at Hennifer Clopez pretending to speak Spanish. How cute.
Enough with Mexican culture everywhere it's boring I just don't care anymore sing some other language this isn't exotic or interesting anymore
Would love to see an English version as well, so the duality of Puerto Rico is truly represented and so more of the world can understand. Love the collaboration!
Forget about the movie IT the scariest thing is when you lose sight of a spider

Best Episode yet !! 👌🏼
😆😂🤣
I looooove Simons cat!!!! ❤❤❤
The 164 dislikes are the spiders
Lol sassy cats
SSS💙💙💙💙💙🍓🍓🍓🐶🐱🐜🌾🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🌈🌭🍕🍕🍩🍩🍩🍩🍡🎠🎠🎠🎠🎠🎠🗼🗺🌚🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜
And there is nothing I can do when I realize with fright \nThat the Spiderman is having me for dinner tonight.
I love the noises the spiders in the attic make
The first one is literally me 😂😂
If i whip my dick out and scream virgin blood will that trend?
Last time I saw you, you had 300k...
Happy Halloween!🎃👻🎃
To be fair, these are all perfectly acceptable responses to spiders, so...
pls reply \nFirst off,  I live your videos\nSecond,  can you give me a shout out\nThird, jk lol UK you won't give me a shout out lol
I just saw this recommended, I don't regret this
That second one killed me. XD
This is my cat !
175 people are araphnaphobes\nLove it.  Best one in a while and I love the others! 🖒🕷
people who watch this are sick.
I created my cat an instagram account. If anyone can, please follow. lil_bomii
How is this not dead yet
Dude needs a fly swat. Works fine on those spiders. A light swat to the hiney of the cat would also stop the couch shredding.
Holy Cat!  The spider episodes had me laughing so hard that I barely could catch my breath!
I'm the same way about bees, he is about spiders.  I know the feeling sir!  Have a good one!
164 people musta been dropped on their head at some point in life
Hey, shutting the cat in the recliner is no joke. My mom told me that, before I was born, my grandpa accidentally crushed a farm kitten that had climbed into his recliner without him noticing, and it was heartbreaking.
Simon is me with spiders. Actually, no, Simon is braver, I would've ran out of that attic when I saw the first one.
Those spiders are cute as heck!!
if i was in the attic and the light went off everyone of my neighbors would of called the police after hearing my screams
I guess we now know who's the real pussy.
https://youtu.be/yLbrJL5aUQw
CUTE!!!!!!!!!\n:3
if spiders were this cute i wouldnt be terrified of them.
Coooooooooool

I LOVE SIMONS CAT
Bart Simpson all grown😸
Im zweiten Video! Den gleichen Trick (etwas Imaginäres werfen) habe ich auch angewendet!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Cats in the attic behave all the same, I guess. Ours used to go crazy among all the boxes, keepsakes, and clutter and kept meowing and snooping around for hours.
You and Simon are wonderful with these halloween and spider episodes 😋😊
Betrayal ... if my cat locked me in a dark attic with spiders, I would cry. Thankfully my kitty tends to smack and eat them. I am suddenly even more grateful for that.
Great xD Simon is scare about spiders like me xD
I like the new episode, but not the compilations. If i wanted to watch Scaredy Cat I would look it up.
I 💖 Simon's Cat! My new fave. Animation!
The animations started 10 years ago ... the real question is : is the cat still alive ?
True horror in its rawest form...lol Brilliant !  Best laugh on the internet all day !
Simon is so funny playing with his old toy robot! :D
I forgot how much I love these
That spider must be a tarantula
HA HA HA This is hands down the most compromising thing to ever be involved with.
*me whenever I see a spider*
This reminded me of the second(?) Harry Potter film. 🕷
ha ha ha I love that he is soo scared and cat turn off the lights ha ha.😂
I think that guy needs to burn down his house because of all the spiders
When I’m feeling grumpy, Simon’s Cat catches me by surprise and makes me smile. Thank you.
The cat looks so cute on the first one, and the second one. 😍😍😍
all of these happen to me I get scared of my cat making noises I hate spiders.ALL OF THESE
That was very funny. I am not afraid of spiders but my daughter sure is. !!!
HOW DID HE NOT FEEL THE SPIDER CRAWLING ON HIM?!?!!?!?!
The one about the spiders in the attic CREEPED ME OUT!!!
I need a cat... \nEveryone, please watch my little nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
Can any girl kiss me plz .I m broken
None of my cats will even kill the spiders.
Three for the ads of one!  Looks like Simon will be looking up sofa reupholstering tomorrow...
Simon   You are a Star .......but u already knew that ............... Peace WihInAlways enjoy watching ........
This was cute. This is a lot like my kitty snowball. He's pretty sure he rules the house. Lol
Yesssss!  Thanks for the new material!
I get why people in Australia have reason to be scared of spiders (heck, I'm afraid of the giant spiders down there!) but normal spiders aren't necessarily scary. I don't like it when they're on me, but they're relatively harmless.
For once it was Simon who wrecked the furniture
These videos are my childhood
Just came across this video. \nI used to watch simons cat several years ago when I was pretty young, it’s great to see the owner of the channel is still making videos and now millions of people are watching them :)
This is GREAT!!  OF course  I just had to watch it   AND then it was a marathon of all your wonderful amazing videos  THANK you so much..  What a team you must have!..
How has this guy only got 4 million subs?
I remember when one of my cats went up in the attic! He came down 20 minutes later with dust all over his whiskers! XD
I like your black and white cartoons best.
the first scene in the attic looks like a big fun coloring page ;)
if you want to help out my channel can you subscribe and comment done when if have done it 😀
I'm not sure why but I get a Garfield vibe from the artwork
Hello there, I am Skylar Fuhrmeister and I make videos here on YouTube, I would absolutely love it if you would watch my newest video https://youtu.be/qkAQcAE0060 maybe even more?
It's a best video
That keeper playing in the Matrix
Hope Scotland qualify from an Englishman
Good luck in the last round against  Slovenia, I hope that Scotland is going to win tonight and that you guys are going to qualify for the World Cup 2018 play-off.\n\nP.S.: A Manchester United fan.\n\nEngland & Scotland together at the World Cup 2018 !
We have some of the most passionate fans in football. Just please don't bottle it in Slovenia
COME ON YOU BOYS IN PINK!!!!!!! #SCOTLANDSPINKARMY
Good decision by a reff!!
Frrrreeeeeeeddddddoooooom i can say it because im Scottish
outside the box thats a free kick,if its a foul its a foul, his point is right, thats a free kick so why no pen
Proud to be scottish 🔵⚪💪now on to Slovenia #believe
Scotland playing amazing keep it up boys.
It would be really cool if wales,england and scotland all qualify for the wc
From an Englishman one more games lad's you can do it!!!!!!! See you in Russia.
Not a fan of that pink kit. They should use black and / or yellow.
I'm just here to see the Scottish Fans freaking out completely. Hope to see you at WC18.\nBest wishes from Germany.
Wow, Scotland actually got a chance to go to the World Cup, what a time to be alive...
Who else was there?
Who is the child that keeps whistling?\nNeeds a dunt with an elbow.
Got to love Scotland! Defo be supporting them over England if they make it... coming from an Englishman (with Scottish family ties)
if scoltand qualify to the world cup, they will be in brazil group, thats always happens.
My friends went to see it! In wembley
That boy from coldplay sure can shoot!
Really Good Match To Watch..
What a game. Should have watched this one
Such a great match and better than a grand football final 😱😱
Wish England had this passion.
So many nice shots, but eventually get such a weird goal,
Excellent keep up the good work!
What's with the faggy pink shirts?
Well done once again for fighting hard scottish boys just hope we now can get a win over in Slovenia be tough game but canny fault the effort from the scotland team
whatever happens,so proud of my country tonight,Benidorm erupted when the goal went in,nice end to a holiday!
6:16 Great to hear the Hampden Roar is back!!!
good job scotland
Not Fair for goalkeeper..
Man off the match is the fans xd
As Gordon Strachan said, \n\nTheir goalkeeper played brilliant, as did the crossbar.
Hi guys can everyone check out my little boys football channel if you like subscribe thank you
Unlucky, own goal at the end
Goal at 5:25
Scotland will go in playoff because our retarded coach fafanec will lose on purpose. Fortunately he will be gone after this match and hopefully never seen again. At least it's a safe bet who bets on football.
I was tearing my hair out with 10 minutes to go ,the amount of times I have seen that with Scotland needing the win and coming so close chance after chance but the ball wouldn't go in the net at the 84 minute mark I just decided Scotland are cursed that's it end of ! And then that goal goes in Jesus Christ hahaha you stress me out Scotland but I love you surley we can do it now !!
We’re on our way mon eh Scots
You have great fans !\nBravo Bravo Bravo Scotland ! \n   With the victory !\n\n\n                                 Scotland Thank you very much for the beautiful game !
Scotland´s football player of the year - Robert Redcard (Mc)Mak ;-)
That keeper deserves a pay rise
What song was used after the OG also lets grab a win tomorrow boys #this time
Not sure if Scotland or Germany. Not sure if slovak goalie = Neuer 😂
You can’t beat a late goal man best feeling ever
So.... Congratulation from Slovakia.
Scotland deserved it
Well done mini terriers
Celtic v dudee 💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚6-1 celtic
What a goalkeeper💗
Chrissy martin 😊\nYou rams !!
We will def beat Slovinia 0-2 mooooonnn boys
why pink... why... FORZA SCOTLAND!!!!!!
Yaaaaaaaaas!
I hate yet rate Skrtel.  Very tough streetwise player.
https://youtu.be/Zo8I_gC6sSM
On ye go boys!
FIFA Keeper
Cmon Scotland!
SUPER👍👍👍
Strong play
Slovakia goalkeeper is hero ❤🔝
MOTM  GRIFFITHS BY A MILE
Scotland won the crossbar challenge!!!
Great refereeing to send that guy off for cheating
Great football from scotland passion and heart. Respect from england. Now join us in russia u deserve too.
Can we do it!? Should never have let England off the hook.
That goalkeeper is world class
strange how it was only weiss that got booed for slovakia
I'm English but support Scotland and Wales more - their team's passion is real
You have to play Slovenia in Slovenia and win because Slovakia will beat Malta. That will be very difficult Slovenia are a solid team. Even if you win there is a good likelihood you'll be lowest second best team and not qualify for the playoffs. In any case whatever happens credit to Strachan for turning a terrible team into contenders.
Holland guy here. We miss that passion and willing to win!
Why is Scotland in pink? I've never seen that before. Also I'm very impressed with that Coldplay singer - didn't know he could play like that! ;p
answer me this, was that bad or was that crap
Imagine booing a Slovakia player because he used to play for rangers pathetic
Scotland did not score a goal in doubles from Slovak
here a slovakian...good match guys, but its still not the end...
Slovakia beast win with malta and rusia is open but scotlan dont win with slovenia
Best fans in the world so much passion from Scotland the English have nothing like this so sad !!😎😛
I wish I had watched the Scotland game instead of England but I had to show loyalty !!    Anyway, brilliant exciting stuff from Scotland. Well done to the ref for spotting that deliberate dive but you missed the penalty for Scotland.  As regards the own goal by Skrtel, that was great, couldn't happen to a nicer bloke
Chris Martin changed the game.
Great performance on both sides
I'm a Rangers fan(also Scotland fan obvs) but griffiths has a wand of a foot, his free kicks are insane. When he banged those 2 against Joe Hart me and my cousin went ballistic, but sadly in typical Scottish style we bottled it and only came out with a point 😂
check out my youtube channel i made a diss track on rice gum!
Scotland no foot ball
This should be on Scots telly.
Scotland!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why are Scotland playing in pink?
Wrong Title..there are never any highlights when Scotland or England attempt to play football
Matty Philips from Aylesbury 👊🏽.
Scotland deserves to be in the World Cup finals in Russia 2018! I love the Tartan Army fans and their passion! Beat Slovenia and you're in the play-offs and I hope you guys do come through it because it's been a long time since Scotland were last in a World Cup finals. The way England are playing at the moment there's not even a remote chance of winning it let alone getting out of the group just like Brazil 4 years ago sorry to say it because not a single player stands out and world class!
no tartan army in moscow :). If you meet Italy good luck to your boys they will sliced you into pieces
That commentator is atrocious.
Future Legends in Soccer \nhttps://youtu.be/5APqg1m0Z1Y\n⚽🌈⚽🌈⚽🌈⚽🌈⚽🌈
We STILL won't make it. Be realistic.
Weak Scotish playerz had a lot of luck. Absolutely meaningless red card for Mak and Skrtel s own goal.
Dont bottle it now against slovenia.
Anyone know why Scotland are playing in pink, not their dark blue ?
HELLO BBs! happy friday!!! i got this face mask smuggled to me from italy... and i'm glad i did! would you guys try this? xox, saf!
I really love how in depth you get with the products and your videos! Much love <3 <3 <3
I am Italian, always lived in Italy... never heard of those brand and product before! It is called maschera like maskéra
There are shock therapy stuff you can try. I have personally tried acupuncture with electro needles and an at home electrode thing where you can increase the current amount
I give it a week before buzzfeed “coincidentally” does this video
Try Nu Face. That works and you will feel something.
Picasso??? Picasso???? come on! that's Edvard Much!
Love you Saf! You're videos are always great 😊
I'm waiting for an I bought the first five things my face mask suggested lol
Well if you need anything from South Africa I'm your guy
Next video: I Bought The First 5 Things My Face Mask Recommended To Me
The scream is not painted by picasso IT is painted by Edvard Munch so Get your information right
Love Saf and Ty but the no face and thr scream references being wrong, I was just * SHAKES YOU*  
Picasso did not paint The Scream.  *sigh*
i use a similar thing,  a tenze machine on injuries bc the electrodes distract the nerves so it doesnt hurt as much but idk how thats relevant bc they seem to be the same except for the result which is deeply confusing\n..
No Name and You look like the scream from picasso made me cringe a tiny bit not gonna lie. (Munsch not Picasso)
The scream* is by van gogh
Pumpkin daddy 😂😂😂 I wasn't even looking at the screen and I fucking knew to which fandom you belong you fucking weirdos I love you so much!!
The blah blah ...115% is a sticker. Have you thought of trying to peel the sticker to see what is underneath?
I love you guys!!!! You are crazy AF!!!!

So plug me in.
I make videos with my girl friend , you should check them out and maybe subscribe
I love you Saf!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever you used the volt meter wrong. You should’ve had the pins on the same half of mask.
JESUS WILL COME BACK TO EARTH SOON! PRAY, READ THE BIBLE, AND REPENT YOUR SINS BEFORE TIME IS UP! GOD LOVES YOU AND ALL PEOPLE**I'm not trying to force my religion on you, I am just warning you of what I believe is going to come & to let you know of the endless love God has for ALL people. If you're wondering why I'm commenting this on such a random video, it's because I have to spread the word as much as I can!
Saf, I think you guys need to get this:\nhttps://youtu.be/y9elKu-d9MA
You looks so beautiful without makeup!
I bought the first 5 things from my phone-controlled face mask coming soon...
Hey Saf, do you and Tyler play any app games? Have you ever looked at the earn free gems offers? There's sometimes interesting ones. I signed up for Curology, it's supposed to be a personalized acne treatment, and it made me think of you 5 things suggested from social media. Do you think you'd ever try that?
does anyone else see the Manikin in the background ?🤷🏽‍♀️😂
You like the Screamer painting, y'know by Picasso. Words of Wisdom.
DO A FULL FACE WISH MAKEUP!
The placement of her mask bothers me sooo baaaad
You gotta stop eating lotion, their not all editable😂
•watches this after The Flash• Holy... is safiyas boyfriend Barry’s father??
the screamer by Picasso i want 2 be buried alive
Picasso didn't paint it. Edvard Munch did
Love the research you did on this! Fun video but also informative.
The Scream painting is not by Picasso. but Munch
Thank you for trying this.  I would not try it myself.
For the people from the US, does Saf have an accent? I'm really curious about it...
add me on snapchat and start a streak @ ewannebo
i would of turned the treatment on before testing for electric pulses in the actual mask
HIS NAME WAS NO FACE NOT NO NAME DAMN
at first i thought she was going to control the phone with the mask lol
You're trending 😍😍😍 if you need something sending from Japan get im touch
I’m cringing from the fact that he thought Picasso painted that
Sad should connect her avatar hair to tylers
Burberry give away on my channel\nI'm new
You know what a cool video would be. A full face of wish makeup!
THE SCREAM IS NOT FROM PICASSO
I love your voice and how you also wanted to know more about how it worked and went out of your way to test the electric part.
I live in the uk
You should do the wavey makeup trend and show it off at the mall
Next video:  “Trying the first 5 things Play Skin recommends me”
Buzzfeed a week later.... welcome back to ladylike and we're trying out masks that are connected to our phones
Seeing a new notification always brings a smile to my face! You’re great at what you do! 🙂
I love how you and Tyler went on that detective mission together to find the electrical current and even researched how currents impact one's skin! This video got my college student brain pumping! Thank you for it :-)
Wasn't no name someone from spongebob?
you should do a buying things from Shein and Romwe
Let's see how far buzzfeed will go to smuggle this into the country to copy this video.
The screamer isn't Picasso X'D
When he mentioned stranger things I died a little. I love that show.
Heyyyy yalll !!!!! Come check out mine and my boos channel ! We would love all of your support & help to get 1,000 ! We will love y’all forever ❤️ thank you so much for all your support & love !
when you tested the mask with the multimeter,  the mask should've been on your face... your face completes the circuit, i think =))
My sister just said i dont think she looks that bad without makeup, she just has a couple nipples she meant pimples....
how about trying not to wear a panty and bra for a day
Okay, but where's that shirt from? I need it.
did... did he say that picasso painting..
In my experience using things that require power from my phone through the headphone jack, you control the power by going up and down on the volume. Max volume giving you the most electricity. Some things won't work if you have the volume too low. That might help too :)
Hey peeps! I challenge you guys to try and find random videos across YouTube and find my tip comments! Try to comment them in order if you can! (They will have a labeled number) \n\nTip #1 We all make mistakes; learn from them, embrace them! That's what makes us different and fun

My Favourite internet love couple❤️ My Glow Queen and her knight in shining armour and their little gorgeous princess.. why people hate on them I don’t know it actually puzzles me how people can be so nasty about people they don’t actually know. I can actually say if anyone inspired me to start my own YouTube channel it is this little family and I actually adore each of them so much for being so genuine, people say how some youtubers act fake on camera but Nicole and Casey are actually genuine and real the same with saffron and I’m honestly looking forward to the day I get to meet them and thank them personally although I’d probably get overly shy, aha😂 point is you haters actually have no reason to hate on them if you don’t know them and if you’ve never met them... KEEP DOING WHAT YOU DO BEST NASEY BECAUSE YOU’RE PERFECT HOW YOU ARE! I LOVE YOU GUYSS SO SO SO MUCH❤️💍🎦😋 ps...Casey, you’ve got a one in a million time to put a ring on it don’t you think?!❤️💍
Happy late birthday ni, hope you had an amazing day lovely❤️🎈 you’re such a genuine, amazing soul and such a good mum you deserve all of the good that comes to you and I genuinely mean that xox
Hope you had a good bday nii. Casey your the best dad and boyfriend I've ever seen☺️💕
I hope ni had an absolute fantastic birthday💚 lots of love to all of you💋
Who gives a shit!
NICHOLE looks like Tom Mc's girlfriend from syndicates vlogs

Happy Birthday Ni!! Hope you had the best day! Here’s to your first birthday as a mummy☺️☺️☺️

if you finna wear makeup just be a fucking girl
I was actually born in the wrong generation... Wth is with this...

I love your red lipstick ❤️ Please checkout my Channel 🙏🏻
she reads my 2013 fan tweets to me*
fav vid of him and it was posted on my bdayyy
WHAT LIP DO YOU HAVE ON I LOVE IT
James is a sweet guy... God bless you! You're special 😘
Am I dumb or does the title make no sense
I loved this collab so freaking much and OMG COLLEEN'S MAKEUP SO MUCH ITS SO PRETTY!
Oh... m.... goodness! I just came across this channel and he's so beautiful
Been waiting for this collab for a long time! This was amazing. Love the finished look!
Ugh I love you both so much but I have to say that James, you look fucking stunning in this video
WHERE DID COLLEEN GET HER POPSOCKET!!!! I’m obsessed lollll *Edit: I added “!!!” Instead of “?!?” oops.*
This is EVERYTHING!!! Awwww the feels
She looks so beautiful without make up no hate towards her wearing make up
James u r so inspiring and beautiful keep going your vids are great 💕💕 love uuuu
colleen would have given birth to James when she was 12 if she was his mother
Slow the fluff down. Lol my brain is exploding in confusion from trying to understand half the shit you said. 😂😂 😘
anyone notice the title? while SHE reads my 2013 fan tweets to HER?
Your pretty but you talk a little to fast
I want you to do my frickin makeup AGH
First time watching her in her normal state. I love her.
I've gotten my makeup done by someone at sephora once and no joke it looked like a four year old did it. Just because you the title of makeup artist doesn't mean that your better at makeup than other people. (That's not to say that they always do bad makeup though.)
she looks s o good
She looks just like him on
OMG her make up is incredible you are so talented James! Subscribed sister!
I always see people saying that James talks too fast, I kinda like it tho..
6:18 that does not sound like colleens voice lol

I seriously want to rail that boy pussy
It's cover girl not cover guy
How RIDICULOUS looks a GUY with lipstick and makeup
What are you doing to your face, dude?
I can't believe she is hanging out with this jackass.
Faggots and fags
Fraud
Loved the video!!!! But James I think, as a professional makeup artist, the biggest problem between Online Beauty Gurus and Makeup Artists is not that you're making money or talented. In fact, I get inspired from some beauty influencers. The problem is that some of your peers say they are Makeup Artists without putting in the time of being interns, getting disrespected, and learning how to take care of their models. So all in all my problem only comes when the title Makeup Artists is taken from us. Love you!!! Just wanted to clear up that me and my groups of professional muas don't hate beauty influencers. 😇💜💙💚💛❤️💜💙💚💛❤️💜💙💚💛❤️💜💙💚💚❤️💜💙💚💛❤️💛💚💙💜💙💚💛❤️💛💚💙💜
How can people enjoy these cunts
I fucking hate faggs who wear makeup and James Charles is a discrace to the entire human race and is just a shity person FUCK GAYS
Wtf is wrong/happening to my generation??
FAGS. WHY THE FUCK DID THIS POP UP IN MY RECOMMENDED
Men aren't supposed to wear make up.
I wanna stab this nigga with a crack pipe then splash boiling water in his face before dropping a couple cinder blocks on him
The first Vox Borders documentary launches in 8 days. It's publishing October 17th, across Youtube and Facebook. The other 5 will come weekly after that, on Tuesdays. If you want to make sure you don't miss them, you can follow me on Facebook: www.facebook.com/johnnyharrisvox or sign up for my newsletter: www.vox.com/borders-email. \n\nI'm so excited to release these. I've been working on nothing else for the past 6 months, and I think they'll live up to the hype!\n\n- Johnny
Those blonde fur monkeys with blue/green eyes kind of look like crackKkas.
Waiting for the documentaries!
The other species recently migrated to Europe causing trouble their
If your english you KNOW
I went there when I was 7, and there was a van trying to drive that was completely covered in monkeys
1:40  Proof your education system is racist.  He could have simple stop anyone and asked hey! this bathing thing you do? who taught you?   Answers:  The Moors who own  Gibraltar and rule Spain for almost a millennium ..  yeah they came on those floating things called ships. Brought a bunch of nice things and animals like monkeys\nWHITE HISTORY BOOKS:  the entire planet waited for Europe to civilized them. if you see anything cool = its alien or some white-guy escaped and build it for them. The end
What do you mean Europe is bringing hundreds of monkeys by the day from africa
Large Body of Water? Found the video Trump watched
Man start WW3 already ... I want a new COD game
I got married in Gibraltar about 9yrs ago. One of those monkeys stole my ice cream. The babies are so cute and they will walk up to you and take food
See Europe doesn't need African migrants we have our own monkeys!
If Box wanna slag of the UK maybe they should atleast slag of Spain for controlling four colonies in Morocco and refusing to give them back at all.\n\nAtleast the UK held a referendum for the people of  Gibraltar to decide their fate.
THERE ARE a lot of different wild Monkeys in Europe,very wild ,aggressive and dirty..Thanks to Angela Merkel
Europe has more than enough domesticated monkeys to make up for it
They’ll snatch all food out of you ... saw it a few times..
When did it become Europe lol
i thought it was gonna be KSI and Deji
Just the tip you say?
'give it back to Spain'...it's been a British territory longer than the USA has existed. Monkeys are funny animals though!
There's monkeys. Learn some English.  It's there are monkeys.
Young monkeys are not called children.
My city has more monkeys than the entire population of POLAND . And this place too was once ruled by those bits.  Left some monkeys here
Stop the video, the answer is muslims, Muslims are the wild monkeys in Europe
Thought the guy in the thumbnail was a monkey😂
we have plenty of wild monkeys in the US.. we are currently paying their EBT with our tax dollars...
Don't you guys ever talk about anything but Trump?
Damn I miss Gibraltar. Lived there for seven years as a kid. I remember going to the beach all the time with my mum and sister and seeing the apes (sorry to be a nerd but they are technically apes, not monkeys) coming down to the beach and annoying the seagulls. They are cheeky bastards-one jumped on my sister's back and basically photobombed a family photo, which we still have to this day.
Be careful they have been known to throw barrels
please please please work on the color grading of the video , its quite painful to watch :(
White people killed most of em.
I’ve been to Gibraltar one of the monkeys jumped on my shoulder and the same thing happened to my mom and the monkey pooped on her
You forgot to count other 30,000 in that town...
I’m worried the moneys might fall off the edge of the concrete railing
Thought that was Adam Kovic on the thumbnail
I want to visit Gibraltar now.
I see no Africans in this video, you lied to me.
Wars between major country can still happen.
I love the Borders series. Please do more
They were most likely brought from Morocco.
what about the black people?
can't wait for this episode
Only? I thought Europe let in immigrants from the Middle East and Africa?
Having been to Gibraltar, I can say from experience, that these monkeys are crazy.
I thought the wild monkey they were going to talk about was the one with the beard.
3:50  it is so lucky to keep your phone from monkey, even after taking photos
Oh my god, the presenter is so handsome.
Anyway, like I was sayin', shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it. Dey's uh, shrimp-kabobs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo. Pan fried, deep fried, stir-fried. There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich. That- that's about it
Fun fact, there's also a superstition that if the ravens of the tower of London ever leave that the Kingdom will fall. I guess it's a British thing.\n\nAlso why would we ever give Gibraltar back to span when it's people have voted repeatedly to remain British? And in the treaty ceding the territory it was given to the British in 'Perpetuity', I.e. forever. There's zero legal basis for it to be Spanish.\n\nBesides, the spaniards have no right to whine when they have the exact same deal in Melilla and Ceuta., except they don't have any treaty to be there, and I think from what we've seen in Catalonia they are so scared of people having a free vote over their country they'll beat up old men and women before they'll allow it.
I'm now to YouTube.\nBurberry give away on my channel. \n#Subscribe
gibraltar is my city
He says that the Mediterranean sea is between Spain and north Africa (which it is) but Gibraltar is less than 70km away from Africa. The ferry ride is an hour long. There's barely a point in human history where we couldn't transport the monkeys.
The only runway in Gibraltar is practically just a wide street that pedestrians can cross.
The fathers are involved? Wow.  Even these monkeys have more pride then some of, Those Americans.
africans and muslims in Europe are also monkeys so the title is inaccurate.
yeah! monkeys! I love monkeys! I wish I was there to play with the monkeeeees!!!!
I was there over 12 yrs ago and loved it. Was so much fun.
Agent Smith: I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species and I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You're a plague and we are the cure. \n\n\nwhy there is not many wild animal in Europe?
What about the monkeys that scream allahu akbar while they drive a truck into crowds? Would love to see a documentary on your conversing with them.
When i visited my grandma in Portugal there was wild monkeys in the woods
this is a very nice, quick and funny video
With so much **** if it's British or Spanish, why don't you change those English subtitles into Spanish ones.  Check this out: https://youtu.be/98UHkCpoWdc
TS NOT SPANISH OR BRITISH ITS ARABIC BRUIH STUDY YOUR FACTS FIRST HHHHHHHHHHH THATS WHY ITS CALLED JABAL TAQIR IBN ZIAD
Stop referring to any random place in Europe as Europe. You don't travel to Myanmar and say I just got to Asia. You don't travel to Brazil and say I just got to South America. There are 50+ countries in Europe and they're just as diverse as the countries on any other continent. By the way, one of those monkeys tried to steal my camera last time I went... to Gibraltar.
not native to Europe, its actually introduced by humans from north Africa
So race again? People are intriguing. Who knew those MLK videos for black history month would touch so many people.
No they're not... we got Muslims now....
So it's not the immigrants?  :V
the only wild monkey in europe are all the subsaharan refugees
You have the PeakDesign backpack! Man I wish I could get it...
Visit York on a Race Day and see the fabled European white monkey wear shiny suits and beat up women!
What kind of statement is So I just got to Europe It's a continent bro
There are plenty of monkeys in Europe. I see them every day, sometimes I become one.
I’ve met Gibraltar monkeys !! They’re so cute !! Had no clue they were the only wild ones in Europe huh
Here's a fun fact: these monkeys are called Barbary Apes but they're not actually apes, they're monkeys. They're also the only type of monkey that doesn't have a tail.
Sigh... when vloggers were just vloggers and not Journalists.
You'll find many more in Sweden and Germany.
Didn't Merkel just let in like 5 million?
“These monkeys live on a giant rock called JABRONI”
in india there are plenty of them
They are apes. Monkeys have tails. #fact
It's *really* weird seeing a macaque outside of Asia, let alone in Europe
You probably make the best videos on YouTube.
I hear Sweden has wild monkeys too #Rapefugees
I didn’t know Vox would do a video about Muslim Syrian refugees.
what about the refugees
There are no monkeys in codww2 in gibraltar map
I like monkeys.
Stop monkeying around
GOOOOD Mystical morning!
Good luck m8!

I  post the *RAREST* Snapchats on my channel check them out on my playlists (Only real savages)🔥💪🏾
I'd love to know what Mike's pregnancy essentials are; I bet that'd be hilarious.  Excited for you!
If you decide to breastfeed, the first couple weeks of breastfeeding are the hardest and there’s such a steep learning curve, but if you are able to push through it, it’s definitely worth it. I will say that if you end up deciding breastfeeding isn’t for you and some people give you a hard time about it, remember that being a good parent is making sure your baby is fed. It doesn’t matter if it’s breastmilk or formula. Fed is best. Period!
Essentials for when you get really big: shoes that you can get on without bending down - I wore wellies for a month 😂. I also had really bad heartburn the last month, so chewing tablets came in handy. \nEssentials for coming home from the hospital: granny panties, maxipads, a stocked frigde and freezer ( including snacks for visitors) we had homemade chili, butter chicken, pies and lasagna for the first two weeks. I was so pleased with my idea. \nOh, and padsickles - google how to make them. And I really wish I had a Squirt bottle in handy. Sorry for the tmi lol\n\nOh  oh oh.. LANSINOH creme saved my life (nipples) and maybe a nipple shield just in case.
Ovia ia great!  I use ovia fertility!  Great app :)
omg your skin is GLOWING <3
The first pregnancy essential is.... who is the father!?
I'm going to have to look into the max vs plus because I'm wondering why anyone would want to take 3 instead of 2 tablets lol. 😵 I am sooooo in love with ur necklace would love to know where it's from please I'll be calling my bump Luna so I'm obsessed with moons! Xxx
Medela nipple shields and read as much about breastfeeding as possible.
Are you sure you're normally a 32C Fleur? I was measured as a 32C recently and I'm quite busty for my petite frame. Either that or you just hide your boobs very well :-)
Also with the ovia app, you get 4 choices of the baby size comparison! If you go to the settings, you can chose from fruits/veggies, silly animals, toys, and persian bakery items!
I really hope you do breastfeed! It's the most nutritious and wonderful milk for your baby and there's nothing quite like it on Earth. Make use of lactation consultants too who can and will make your breastfeeding journey easier. \nMany women stop due to them thinking they're not producing enough, when in fact it's just the baby cluster feeding! Newborns eat constantly, it's their way of regulating your milk supply and will take around 12 weeks to establish. \nIf you haven't already, read up the science behind it all. It's incredible stuff! ❤️
Jools olivers book Minus Nine To One is my favorite Pregnancy book. XX
have you decided what to do with your belly button piercing? you mentioned it in an earlier video and I can't remember if you came to a decision
You should download the Wonder Weeks app for when your bubba is born! It's sooooo helpful for knowing when your babe is entering a leap and gives you heaps of info of what to expect! X
Bra strap in the tea = great YouTube moment!
Watching this at 3.30 AM while pumping 😅🐄 #momlife
Without plugging....I have filmed loads of videos on pregnancy and breastfeeding. It can be really tough and quite lonely. I found YouTube so helpful for any questions I had xxx
My little boy is six months and the most used things for me are muslins... Millions of them!!he spits up and protects us from having to change a million times a day.\nA basic light weight bouncer, I have two a tiny love rocker and napper(which is also brilliant as it lies flat)and a mothercare basic one as I can lift it one handed so if I need to go to different rooms or the bathroom its portable, I probably used it most for getting ready in my dressing room as he could see me and I wasn't running in and out of rooms to check him.\nA lie flat high chair, hauck do one and other brands(think stokke have new born inserts for theirs,they are very lush looking).bit more  pricier but great for sitting at table or in kitchen and eating and good way to get bubs used to seeing food getting made,eaten,sitting as a family.\nNot new born but my boy is now weaning and I live the Annabel karmel silicone freezer trays supper easy to batch cook and the weaning app on app store for ideas.\nHave loafs more but will leave it here...good luck xkx
Epsom salt baths when I got near the end 🙌
http://www.bounty.com/pregnancy-and-birth/pregnancy/pregnancy-week-by-week/20-weeks-pregnant this like but many more websites
I really loved the H&M maternity jeggings with the full panel that goes all the way up, way more comfortable in my opinion! Also during towards the end of my pregnancy I could not wear any sort of jeans/leggings I lived in maxi dresses!
I'm 6months ahead. Wren is 16 weeks now. Postpartum essential; high waisted leggings that suck you in again because I felt like I was falling apart, so empty and flabby and most of my maternity jeans just let the flab hang out! These ones are most like the ones I had. \nhttps://m.topshop.com/en/tsuk/product/textured-elastic-ponte-legging-5855128\n\nBreastfeeding essential is support. All hands on deck to feed you and keep the tea and toast and pillows and blankets coming especially that first two weeks. It will hurt a lot until it doesn't. Cabbage leaves for engorgement work really well, surprisingly! \nBaby essentials; Vibrating bouncer seat, clevamama sleep pod, playmat with overhead toys, mirror for the car headrest. \nAnd the very first thing I ditched was my fancy over the shoulder nappy bag in favour of a backpack style handbag from primark. Throw it on your back, both hands free for baby. \nOh and keep getting baby clothes YOU love because you'll get SO many pink things or baby gear emblazoned with Daddy's little princess. x
My bra straps been dipped in my tea 😂😂😂 love you fleur
An absolute essential is Massage oil for your perineal area to avoid ripping during birth 🙃
I'm 36 weeks. I use the Ovia App!! I find it the most entertaining. This week she is the size of a Cabbage patch doll. I am starting to get very uncomfortable. I have to go to the bathroom every hour some nights which is not very cool. But I guess it is training for the interrupted sleeps that I will have in the not so distant future.
Have you tried any of the H&M maternity wear or George at Asda? They look ok for workwear (shirts, trousers etc). Can find lots of jeans but not many proper trousers.
Hi Fleur, I think we are going to have babies around the same time! Xmas babies :) My essentials have been loose fitting dresses, baby apps The Bump and Ovia, Palmers cocao butter, and teas! First mint tea helped me with my gas in the evening but it ended up giving me more heartburn (was probably overdoing it) so I switched to Chamomile tea and drink it max once a day. Another thing I have been loving is watching pregnancy updates, newborn essentials and a day in the life with newborn videos on Youtube haha! Saludos
For once baby is here the wonder weeks app is amazing. Lets you know what stages they're going through at that time. (There is alot) like teething not sleeping etc. It really helped me when my little was growing up. He's 3 now the time really goes so quickly! Enjoy being pregnant it was the best time for me! Xx
'My baby is currently a papaya' 😂😂😂
crazy but importent: Don't forget the dogs:) let them a good smiff of the baby before she'll arrive home xoxo
I also had Ovia app when I was pregnant and liked it a lot :) I had my first baby at the end of August. Newborn essential I really like and I don't know if you have it yet is baby-vac...So funny, but it's a tube that you attach to your vacuum and you can clean a baby's nose with it so easily...Babies have stuffed noses so often, even if they don't have a cold and it's hard for them to eat with stuffed nose...Also treat yourself with massages, pedicures, etc. before the baby comes...:D
For goodness sake do your pelvic floor exercises!! In fact self-care in general is massively important when you have a baby (mine's 8 months now). It's very easy to let it fall by the wayside! \nTwo apps I would recommend for finishing off your pregnancy are Kegal Kat and Contraction Timer. The timer will let you track your stage 1 labour, which I found useful to help me decide when to go to the hospital. Also for the hospital I took a prepared playlist with me - it gives your brain something to focus on when the pain gets bad. Remember to take water and snacks for you and Mike! You'll both (mainly you) need your energy!
Ovia does show you fruit too! Just change what you want to see each week - you can switch between fruit & veg, weird animals, fun & games etc
Hi! I’m about a week ahead of you with a boy so it has been so fun watching your updates!! I have been loving super comfy pajama shorts since I get so hot at night and long tank tops with cardigans as it gets into Fall in the US. My skin has been super dry so I have been going through sheet masks like crazy! XOXO
hi  fleur ! how many weight have you gain ??
Would so love to see a baby names video from you!! Xx
There is an app called Sprout I think you might like. I’m due next week but feel ready now!
Super helpful video! I'm looking forward to getting some comfy maternity wear in the next month (it's early days for me). But I'll be checking out those vitamins today as I do want to take omega 3 as well 🙂
Newborn essential - this is a bit of a strange one but the Phillips' 'Hue' light bulbs and hub have saved me with my nighttime feeds. You can control your lights with an app on your phone including a dimmer option so you don't need to get up and turn on bright lights at 3am, if you have a bedside cot, you won't even need to get out of bed! I am a wheelchair user so this has literally been the best thing ever!
★★★★                            ★★★★★★★★★★★★  ★★★★                            ★★★★★★★★★★★★\n*God demonstrated His love to us by sending His Son Jesus Christ, who died and rose from the dead to Give us eternal life.*\n*He also promised to heal your body.*\n (Just ask Him)
Prenatal vitamins are so important during pregnancy and also if nursing.  Those pregnancy apps look fun to use 👶🏼😊
you are glowing Fleur, i loved Ovia when i was pregnant
This is pretty random, but I’m currently 18 weeks with my first, loving maternity jeans, but I miss tucking in tops!  Anyone else experiencing this? 😆
I'm soaking up every single pregnancy content that you put up lol, so so interesting
Number 1 essential when I had my baby girl: Fisher Price Rock n’ Play. She slept in it until she was 6 months old. It rocks and has a sound machine attached... folds up flat for travel. Super light and easy to move around from room to room. I think it was $75 US. So excited for you guys! My Ava is 19 months old and time is just flying so quickly. Being a mom is just the greatest gift 😊 Enjoy every second!
You might not be this far ahead yet for preparing but I highly recommend socks for labor and a lovely lip balm. I had long labors and forgot socks the first time and the air con is freezing and if you have gas and air your lips get so dry x
If you are doings a name reveal, pls, pls, pls, Please do a sugar cookie name eveal
Yeah my name is Joni, glad you are enjoying my jeans!😅
Are you going to do a nursery tour soon? :D Pretty please!
I’m 32 weeks pregnant with my 3rd and the biggest essential I can recommend is SLEEP!!! \nRelax and sleep as much as possible. Also, try a pregnancy massage....heaven!!
I don't have a baby myself but im a caregiver and i'd say you need tons of biebs, specially if you care about your baby looking neat. You will need to change them often, for heavy drooling days (lol) i recomend you look for the ones that have plastic lining on the back so moisture stays away from her skin. Also all plastic when they start with food, spots find their way and are hard to remove!
For my third pregnancy I read Jenny McCarthy's Belly Laughs. It is an interesting read. It talks about stuff during pregnancy/birth that are taboo and I found it pretty funny and real.
You should try reading a parenting book called Bringing up Bebe, it's about French parenting techniques, and an American parent. It's really eye opening!
I'm currently 8 months pregnant and I just wanted to say first that I love your updates! Also that if you want to geek it a little more the book the first 6 months is a fantastic book for newborn Info, it's written by a midwife and it's an Australian book if you want to check it out. Xx
Fleur I am obsessed in watching Emily Norris videos. She has done baby essentials which I found really useful
I'm happy for you Fleur!☺
I am actually a nanny for a currently 9month old. But have been with him since he was 3 months.  The things that i would recommend are the BabyWise book by Robert Bucknam M.D. and Gary Ezzo!! The most incredible philosophy on sleep.  Its all about fitting a baby in to your life versus the other way around.  The parents i work for are able to live their normal lives, and know when their child while actually be sleeping versus having a new schedule everyday.  Also a dock-a-tot!!! and back is best sleep suits!
Great video! I'm just behind you at 25 weeks, and I've been loving the Palmer's oil for my belly. I need to try the tummy butter! And I've been reading Bringing up Bébé. Love the book so far. Great advice from an American ex-pat living in France. Hope you're enjoying your pregnancy! You look beautiful! xx
Do you think you and Mike  or just you will do a baby names we love but won't be using video?
pregnacare max is the best used it throughout my pregnancy.....
Two kids down, working on a third. Definitely buy (if avail in UK): Nose Frida, Kinsa Smart Thermometer (probe kind), coconut oil for breastfeeding, and a touch lamp.
I'm 23 weeks pregnant and I'm so glad im not the only freak obsessed with watching every newborn essentials video on YouTube haha
My son is now 18 weeks old and my essentials were my fit ball to bounce on as I got close to due date, soft sports bras for bed and night shirts a pose to pj's. when you pack your hospital bag make sure you take some pre made milk bottles I.e cow and gate etc inc saw it takes a while for baby to latch I had been awake for days and my son had tongue tie so our only way to feed him was formula to start.? I have commented before but aquanatal classes are the best thing I ever did for exercise and to meet other mums. My no.1 tip is to meet other people at antenatal classes that are due a similar time, no matter what you read nothing beats k owing other people are going through the exact same and it is the best form of support as a new mum, I never ever read a pregnancy book as it is such a personal experience you just learn and develop every day when baby arrives. enjoy every second of being pregnant, before you know it you will have the most perfect little person by your side but my gosh you will miss your bump after a while. It's honestly the best feeling in the world xxxx
Yes leggings are a must during the last part of pregnancy and if there is one thing to invest in for baby it's a good car seat and stroller hands down
I just had my baby girl last week!!' Definitely recommended sleepyhead ! You should do a 'favourite names' , 💯for the Topshop jeans x
Hey Fleur! Would you talk about how pregnancy has effected your relationship with Mike? All good if that's too personal though! Xx
I don't have kids yet but I really like your videos :) \nWhere are your necklaces from? They're SO cute.\nAnd I also love your iPhone cover - where is it from?
I’m 35 weeks I use the glow nurture app I find talking to other ladies due the same time as me reassuring
Have you been keeping a pregnancy journal? I've always considered keeping one when I get pregnant but I'm bot sure how time consuming that would be
Omg this was me last year- I can't believe how fast this year has gone. My little boy was born 27th December. Savour everything because you'll blink and miss it!!
On Ovia, at least in the US, you can  change the size comparisons. Mines currently toys, but you can change it to fruit if you want!
I'm 20 weeks pregnant, my essentials are also the pregnacare max and clarins body tonic oil for my tummy it smells amazing and last for ages!!! Xxxxx
Where is that moon and star necklace from!? So beautiful! For me i found bio oil actually was more effective for stretch marks based on my two pregnancies. Second pregnancy i combined the body butter with bio oil and saw a significant difference.
Loving the videos about your pregnancy, keep them coming 💕xxx

You'll be a beautiful mama. Love you 😘😘👶👶
I'm due 22nd January I'm currently in week 24! Been absolutely loving the pregnancy videos:) xx
Baby centre is my favourite app, for pregnancy and after the baby is born. My daughter is 11 weeks now and I look at that app everyday! Also online Community is nice, My baby was a July baby and so was everyone else's. Xx
I’ve just noticed your audience is (also) growing at past the 1/2 million mark!  Congrats on keeping great content coming, including your wonderful pregnancy vlogs 💖
i used a contraction counter app which i found very useful! :) x
Hi fleur omg 6 months where's the time gone not long now.so excited for you guys.ive heard so much about hypno birthing have you thought about that yet.you look amazing.xx😀
Are you going to show the baby in your vlogs and such when she is born or are you going to keep her life off of youtube?
If you chopped yourself in half... bahaha, i love how your sense of humor gets injected into whatever you're talking about. Such a chill gal!
i have a 20 month old and found the postpartum apps for tracking feeding etc. to be WONDERFUL! the one i used was called baby tracker, but there are so many out there. you aren't getting much sleep once they've arrived but my doctor kept asking constantly about the details of feeding, pooing etc at checkups and i found it extremely helpful to refer to the app since i couldn't remember anything from day to day. you can track/graph their sleep, growth, everything.
I love the Nuture app. Especially the community section.
Love this confident Fleur showing us her bare belly and bras! 😂 But seriously, so pleased for you and Mike x
Are you doing Vlogmas this year as it will be white close to the birth of MINI DE FORCE
Oh my goodness, I wasn't prepared for the fruit thing and you saying your baby is currently a papaya. :D
Currently my baby is a papaya... That made me laugh... So cute
I have a 9 week old 😊 and I'd say that my top three essentials would have to be the sleepyhead, snuz pod and mamaroo all three I would purchase again in a heartbeat! Oh and Muslins! People will tell you that you can't have too many and honestly it's true! I love the Aiden and Anais swaddle size ones because they are great for using as a blanket in the house and card seat 😊
my twin babies (a boy and a girl!) are three months old! :) I lived in maternity leggings the last month of my pregnancy. the thought of putting jeans on when i was that uncomfortable made me want to cry. so, for sure stock up on comfy, stretchy leggings! especially for when you are swollen towards the end. good luck!! best wishes!!
Essentials- full fat coke and coffee- sugar and caffeine will be your friend;) and  big comfy granny pants- just in case of c section, loads of loose pj bottoms/lounge wear. I had packed bloody leggings to come home in- ended up having an unplanned c section and I couldn't even get my foot in them! Nothing tight! x
My mom was pregnant in the very early 70s, and there wasn't such a thing as prenatal care in those days (no vitamins either). She lost a few teeth due to it, no joke (because I was taking all of the calcium out of her). I think it's essential to get these vitamins in and I'm glad they do this now and it exists!
when is she due
Stretch marks being genetic: my mom has none but I do and I haven't even had a baby yet or gained/lost a huge amount of weight. You just don't know what genes will come out and what won't so you may as well look after your skin. That's my 2p.
Be carefull with folic acid in combination with vitamine B12. Be sure that the B12 is at a good and healthy level because folic can hide a b12 deciency.
Where is your moon/star necklace from Fleur? It is beautiful! Thank you so much for doing this video! Love hearing all the essentials and tips you've figured out along your pregnancy. I'm so excited for you! Btw your glowing! <3
Which items are sponsored? The first one I'd say?
An Ad? Seriously?? Come on.
You said since I found out I was pregnant, that means the pregnancy was unplanned. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This video shows the incredible skills of the pilots. Even after an unexpected wind gust after touchdown they managed to re-align with the runway. Incredible job by the pilots !!
Then the passengers asked .... Did we land or were we shot down? =8^|
That is pretty similar to my landing in FSX .... without any wind.
This landing was made by a pilot who clearly does not understand the fundamentals of making a crosswind landing.  This was an un-stabalized approach and speed was too slow.\n\nThis pilot lost control, and this was a quintessential example of when a pilot should have gone around. The fact that a missed approach was not executed is a clear demonstration of very poor judgement.  This was a near crash - not a landing.\n\nI would bet a shinny quarter the the pilot has no time as a CFI, where a good stick learns too fly.\n\nATP • MEL • CFI-IA • BGI • CE-500 • LR-JET • IA-JET
A part of me is convinced this is not an ideal situation
This is a PILOT!!! congratulations! (for the spotter too )
Wow ! Imagine sitting at the back that plane when touched down .  That’s some proper oversteer correction .
I know for a fact that Düsseldorf ( like every major airport in the world) has a straight runway. \nHow come the runway in your video has a huge bend in it? The runway marker lines swerve off hugely to the right  ( as the viewer sees it). ( strangely -just at about the same spot the aircraft makes a huge swing also to the viewers right. Roughly following the runway lines ( yep a bit of lateral movement I agree - it would not have been a smooth landing)  but not anywhere as wildly either side of the centre line as the video makes out. \nI smell a rat! \nI have no doubt the landing was bumpy - the crosswinds effects are obvious - but this looks very much like the video has been modified to make the aircraft look like its swinging more wildly than it is.  \n\nCan you post the video showing the same landing but ensure the runway is straight this time?
Pilots are one of the most courageous people in the world..!!\nAfter looking at the comments, they might / might not be prepared for this event. But keeping mind stable and reacting to these kind of extreme situations is not as easy as it sounds..
Lol it’s a Dash 8 Q400\n\n\n\n“HOW TO DO DONUTS IN AN A380 TUTORIAL 100% WORKING DOESNT CRASH 2017 100% LEGAL”
That's just how they normally drive in a UAE
during a STORM?  It is sunny and shiny,  only crosswind, and not the best technique, but great video
Why do they land in such conditions...?
Wow!! What a landing, well done Me.Pilot!! 3》
That, I would applaude for on touchdown...
0:29 What's up with the engines rising out of the runway?
emirates got deep pockets, tehy pay for the best pilots
The way it landed like airplane then started turning
Damn, those pilots must have handled their adrenaline rush pretty damn good.
I wonder if people sitting near the tail are ok, they were shaken hard side to side about 60 meters?
A 747-8 could have handled it with ease.
O:35 I'M COMING FOR YOU
Yeahhhh..\nFuck the bullshit.....\nPay the man.......\nOr The Woman......\nNeither way,  they earned it.
bet 1 person in the back didnt do their seatbelt all the way and they flew into the other side of the plane and injured him/herself and 2 others when the pilot decided to swing the back and do a tightturn left-right quickly /tried to drift and forgot about those who would be more affected because of the wiggly pencil crap but its k have empathy for the plane not the passengers because passengers.are humans and humans are stupid
I think those 4 engines on the plane are the same size as the pilots' balls.
Looks like an A380 being grounded for a thorough hard landing inspection, an incident report involving EATA, Airbus, and Emirates, and a story for the pax.
*few minutes after that landing, pilot uploads a video on his youtube*  How to drift an airbus a380, 2017 working method
Kudos to the pilots.  Great job landing this monster...
I hope all the poor little cargoes were okay.
https://youtu.be/Xn05oLXFFvg \nWatch this is lit
I'm watching from inside a plane, no kidding. I'm waiting for takeoff. I hope pilots here are as good as them!
Wow, my local news has your video on its website!  Great job!
The heavy a380 thrown sideways like a paper... any one could possibly have a video taken from inside the plane, it would be interesting to see how passengers reacted to that. Amazing skills from the crew and great shot.
What a beautiful bird. This huge ship in the hands of a skilled pilot. Not to mention the very worthy computer software. A collaboration of technology and skill. But this video shows a beautiful bird making ground.
Oh Good Lord!!! I felt that from here!!  That was quite a jolt!! \n  That must have been really frightening on the plane.  :(
It can drift\nWhat do you mean drift?
Why didn't the pilot postpone or call off the landing considering dangerous winds
looks like a safe plane but how long does the frame last in these conditions?
LSO Score 1/5. I'm certain the flight dept will agree with the public relations ppl that there was never any danger to the pax or crew as they bring the pilot in for refresher training on crosswind technique.
When you play Simulator Games
A good landing is one you can walk away from.\nA great landing is when you can fly the plane again.
Too much initial left rudder input caused the adverse yaw condition imo
They're going to have to bring in a steam cleaning crew to go over the seats after a landing like that.
Imagine how that would’ve felt on the inside
The pilot's name is Sheikh Al Tu Maach Radha.
Nossa acho muito top aviões e o mais incrível e a experiência dos piloto em dominar uma máquina dessa contra as forças naturais
The day an airbus a380 lands just like an RAF Sea Harrier and drifts along the airport's runway just like one of Vin Diesel's cars in any fast&furious clip....
What this video actually shows is the incredible lack of skill of the pilot.  No pilot worth his salt would have decrabbed and then landed wings level.  I think all of us professional pilots watching this cringe at anyone saying what a great job this guy did.
People who even can't drive cars properly making comments about pilot skills, That's funny..
This was shown in mainstream media last night.Great skills by the pilot's.
Emirates is from dubai what do you expect 😂😂
This guy is not a pilot... He is THE PILOT !
Do not underestimate the A380. It's superior and mighty. This HUGE beast handled an uncontained engine failure where as most airplanes are doomed as a result, can be controlled with out either hydraulic systems as long as the FBW system is working, most quiet and comfortable place and can be controlled and manipulated fast like in this video. Don't let the plane size fool you. Man this beast is more than just a normal plane
Amazing. Just wonder the colossal forces those tires were submitted.
The Fast and the Furious: Emirates Drift
Грубейшая ошибка пилота при касании дал левую ногу до отказа. У самолета такого класса тележка шасси устроена так,что при касании ВПП со сносом тележка устанавливается самостоятельно по траектории движения планера ( имеет вращение вокруг своей оси, как на Ту-134 и Ту-154 ) Далее фюзеляж сам за тележкой развернулся бы по направлению к оси ВПП.
wave off !!
Tokyo drift😂!
GREAT PILOT
very great job, congratulations !!

me imagino que despues de ese atrrezijale van a dar una mirada al tren de aterrizaje y a las demas estructuras, si que lo puso aprueba ¿ pudo haberlo hecho mas despacio ? y no caer tan abruptamente
Error del piloto...de aca a la china.....y el380 se la rebankoooo
Schaut mal bei mir vorbei 🤗\nhttps://youtu.be/9I2HHzxxFNo
Da wirkt selbst ein Riesenvogel wie der A380 wie ein Spielzeug. Man sollte erfurcht vor der Natur haben.
Warum ist das in den Deutschen Trends? :(
Das ist nichts besonderes ... das müssen piloten können und es passiert andauernd...es ist bloß erstaunlich das es erst jetzt so auftaucht...
Jetzt ist dein Video sogar beim heute Journal zu sehen😀
ول منول  طيار جديد ولا  أوتوماتيكي
I agree that experienced pilot flying the A380 have tremendous ability to handle emergencies like this.  On the other hand this kind or aircraft is equipped with all sort of technologies to correct position, take off, banks, and, of course, landings.  This is a high risk landing with great disaster potential.  Human error has caused big accidents in the past.  Computer corrections are a must in this situations and you can tell the machine was almost out of control.  True, crosswind landings are common, but, not with all these elements.  Those were not kids winds, and this is not a typical jet landing.  I'm positive the computer assistance avoided the disaster.
This stuff is so scary \nWhat a great pilot
driftin'.
Give that dude a pay rise
This is proof that Emirates Airlines have the best pilots
Comm people stop balming pilot The wind was strong that's why
That pilot needs a raise at least.
OMG, This is so scary. May Allah continue to protect all of us.. Good job to the pilot and the cabin crews.

Ok, Good and nike. Well come to...
Those are some huge pumpkins!! 🎃
TW: Trypophobia - start at 0:42 to avoid.
Hank when are you going to tell is about your book
Is Richard Simmons on this list?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YflsCectl6I  you must watch this video to save youtube
For some reason it really makes me chuckle at 2:38 when Hank says Now here's the situation... Because it's a pumpkin situation.
These people with their giant pumpkins make me think of cheese doodles guy
2:00 so thats where Starbucks's lemon pound cakes come from...
Came back to comment good job still trending barely broke 300K and that wouldnt be if it wasnt “trending” lol
I'd watch you read the phone book, Hank.
That watermelon in the thumbnail can feed all of Africa
Weird. I live in Tennessee and am friends with a Chris Kent. But as far as I know, he doesn’t have a hobby of growing large gourds.
I love this channel.  I am sure Turtles All The Way Down will be amazing, I loved the first chapter and I am thinking of buying it when it gets to my local bookstore :)
I never comment on videos, like ever. But that carrot comment made me lol and I just had to say thank you, Hank. I've been watching since 2010 and you guys just keep getting better! Cheers and love :)
All good as long as they're not 'genetically modified'.
What's with the car-sized watermelon in the thumbnail? I'm somewhat disappointed that the world's largest watermelon was /only/ 350.5 lbs (159 kg).
A pumpkin canoe, hmmmmmm I think I need one!
When life gives you a nine pound lemon tree...you'll probably end up with a concussion
Very lively video.  Wouldn't it be great if those subtitles were in Spanish.  Check this out: https://youtu.be/98UHkCpoWdc
I just hope these fruits and vegetables didn't go to waste for the sake of competition. If I grew the world's largest pumpkin, I'd take my blue ribbon, get some really nice pictures taken, and then I'd have a pumpkin pie party.
Hank, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for this
I want someone to look at me the way that man looks at his onion
Pumpkins and Penguins. Should have slipped a pengiun in this video somewhere.
I work at a nursery, and we have a pumpkin that’s over 1500 pounds, and they get a bigger one every year.
I thought this would be a video about Harvey Firestein and Milo
thank you hank I smiled throughout this entire video
Gain fruits of the spirit🍎🍊🍋🍒🍇🍉GOD HAS EVERLASTING VIDEOS 😁😇🙏
The question is: were they grown organically?
Legend has it the worlds largest melon obtained sentience and began writing music reviews
If we are doing this by weight, wouldn;t it be the heaviest? You could have the Largest Pumpkin measuring by diameter or width, but it could be light if it happened to grow with empty cavities.
This guy looks like the guy from crash course
And people complain about GMOs with these hilarious giant fruits and veg
this vid is just for 3 countries...that uses pounds.
Guys sub to us and watch our latest videos! We are a new channel trying to go big!
3million subscribers I fell like it's been at 2 for ever
i mean sure that pumpkin is big, but i know a james that has a peach that makes that so-called largest fruit/vegetable ever look like a pea.
I love this so much.
This is my favourite vlogbrothers video ever.
Thats cool.\n\nBut you know whats the world's largest thing?\n\n\n\n*YO MAMA*
Does anyone want the other half of my sandwich?
You mean you and your brother.... XD
I think they forgot to put mine. I have the largest 🍆 in the world. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I am obligated to point out that potatoes, onions, sweet potatoes, and cabbages are not, in fact, fruits.

That's organic! ;)
Most impressive.

This guy loves his pumpkins.

Lol lame video
Or my gourd!
You are a very good brother, Hank.
THIS IS THE MOST SWEET AMAZING DISPLAY OF BROTHERLY LOVE I HAVE EVER SEEN I JUST. im so touched i love humanity and the vlogbrothers and im just aaaaaaaa
I love this video so much! :)
i didn't realise you actuALLY MEANT IT
I'm so glad you got the pumpkin regatta in there! It's clearly the best giant pumpkin-themed event. Thanks for a very fun and happy video! Much needed this week. 🙂
Humans, wow. -Hank is response to pumpkin canoes. I ❤️ Hank.
Ok ok now I need a video about the world tiniest things✨
It is so utterly endearing to hear hank console John in this uniquely nerdy way. The brotherly bond is strong :)
It is funny to think about the weight of produce in terms of human new-borns...
Another joyous thing: October 10 is my boyfriend (& love of my life)'s birthday, and is also the day we go to the bank to get pre-approved for our new house :) ♥ (ps: You're his favourite Green brother.)
I teared up at Hank telling John it's gonna be okay. (::: Love! Wonderful video!
The seedy little banana ball actually tastes great. Well, it's not a banana, so you only eat the little seeds inside. But yeah, it's really good.
this video made me so happy. its good to talk about the simple things in life sometimes
Humans ... WOW is the thesis of pretty much all my favourite vlogbrothers videos.
This might be a dumb question but do they still taste the same?
Thank you. SO MUCH for this. <3
I feel like the vast majority of those worlds largest food growers were American.
In my hometown growing up we had the pumpkin festival which was a three day event centered around a pumpkin growing contest. It was always a great time
Very larg, I never see before
I remember walking home from pub one night when I stumbled past lauderette and saw sign on a window that read  sorry we are closed I thought you don't have to be sorry it would be ridiculous of me to think you are open at 3am.
This video is insulting, I've always thought I was the world's largest fruit.

It would suck to empty that pumpkin before carving it
I thought this was going to be a joke about you being a fruit...
Can a person live in a pumpkin.....?
This is so wholesome ❤️
ayyy us minnesotans sure love our tater tots and carrots
Ya'll should play Cuphead together!
“Fruit”
ohhohh the banana made me feel soooo uncomfortable
Are these organic?
I like fruit :D
good video!
my ego was 2nd
WATER-MELOOOONN
I wouldn’t eat any of those.  It looks like a bunch of gmo fruits and veggie or injected with hormones.
You're a scientist Hank!!!!! NO, not pounds!
Selective breeding in agriculture, amazing what we have achieved and some hope for the future, that we can feed the worlds growing population!
That pumpkin has cancer. Unregulated apoptosis. \n\n...j/k it just keeps growing apparently.
Wait does this mean that massive “potato” they ha’ll around in the semi truck isn’t real?

Rudy, oh my fricking goodness, you are my favourite youtuber with about the best talent I've ever seen and heard in my entire life. And oh my goodness! Poo bear was magnificent like really? How can two people have so much talent like really?? Well anyway ur song is now at the top of my favourites list because it is like the best song with like the best lyrics! Anyway I love you Rudy, Your my favourite youtuber! (Tell Poo bear he is SO fricking talented as well!!
Sub to me and I'll sub back
It's so bad how everyday bro gets 109 million views when this is only at 1.7 mill
I love how Poo Bear is becoming a big singer, working with Skrillex & Galantis as a solo artist, but still is humble enough to work with Youtubers still :)
The screen, alike your vision, of your new pineapple iphone was kind-of blurry, and the pineapple wireless headphones weren't working that well...
Take a minute and lets just think rudy needs the fame of music more than jake paul who is 100% autotune and doesnt know shit about music
Rudy is a singer, actor (i think) and a comedian\n\nhe should won a Oscar or a Grammy or even both
Not my type of music, but I can't stop listening to this one. Nice one Rudy!
I love your video 😙😙😙
I love this song
The piano solo sends me to heaven😍
damn,i think this is exactly what we have all been waiting for
This is beautiful. Thank you for sharing😍👍
Do u think Rudy should do music know
Soo much better than all those shitty diss tracks and wanna be rappers trying to make songs .. \nThis is what songs really should be ! \nMeaningful and pleasant to hear !
Everyone please watch BTS blood sweat and tears its on 198 million views and tomorrow it's one year anniversary so please make it 200 million views
Every few years there is a legend who is born \nThe early 2000 had Steve jobs\nThe late 2000 had Michael Jackson \nThen in 2011 we had the rise of messi \nNow in 2017 we have RUDY MANCUSO
my ears....MUST BE IN HEAVEN
Can we get this on iTunes yet???
dammn i want ti be like him talented
Gangway to an other dimension!
You should be a singer!
Make this comment blue and red please Rudy PLEASE Nice single and i do have my headphones like u said😂

This is like one of the best songs ever
you're my true inspiration rudy, you're the reason music has been one of the essential part of my life. please have a look on my channel i started. :)

Don't get me wrong I like Rudy but this video just doesn't make sense to me...
I love this song.
People stop hating cause you know this video is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n😍😍😄😄👌
I love your song
Taken out of context it sounds super racist lol
I'm in awe this is the meaning of talent great job Rudy
Woah! i loved this its so amazing! your so talented rudy!
This is pretty good but it reminds me of Chocolate Rain and that scene from Who Framed Roger Rabbit where Donald Duck and Daffy Duck are playing the pianos together. I can't be the only one who thinks this.
The question is, why did people unlike this?
What can't you do
At last A great song By An #YouTube, after so many fukin Diss Tracks for ksi n Logan 😅
This is amazing ❤️ Rudy you're amazingly talented
This song is not that bad
YYYYYOOOOOOO!!!!!\n\nRudy just blew Michael Jacksons black and white str8 away... even though they both have two totally different meanings or even if it's the same I'm about to put my YouTube on repeat for this song!!!!!! \nYou just totally blew the creativity/talent bar threw the damn roof !!!! My rooof my roof !!! My roof is on fire 🔥 we don't need nothing but Rudy and his fiyyyaaahhh!!! Cuz booaahh yo shit is hot !!! No homo !! I'm gone do like meek mill and let that shit burn !!!!!! Got damn it bro I salute you !!!

Omg u are a very great singer I have ever heard
I loved this music video thanks for making it Rudy you to poo bear
How do you unlike this video
Sorry just wondering is this supposed to have racial meaning??
I really like this song
Is he saying that he perceives the world around him as a creature of either or habit or is there some actually deep meaning that I’m not seeing rn

This is freakin awesome and brilliant! Very creative!!! And Savage! Yoooo
Amém Anitta!!!
Omg i love this ive already seen it about 30 times well dont rudy😂!!!
Okay, but what about the part where Mickey and Minnie gamble their souls to the Devil and have to beat up other soul debtors for their contracts in order to survive?
I liked how Mickey just slapped the debris that was blocking the passage like it was nothing. Kinda makes me wonder how strong Mickey is.
This should be a ride
Ug, this is so cool! That Frame at 3:04 is so good.
How in the world are they going to get back
Lol! Their faces ripped OFF! Haha I love these
Well easter egg of Bear Country, Rivers of America and Big Thunder Mountain\n\nAlso Walt Disney
Just like a Disney World Joyride!
Hilarious! I thought the video was a satire since its sense of humor is a blend between Dumber and Dumber and Family Guy, but it's official Disney's Mickey. I remember classic Mickey's humor was mild and PG-rated. Especially when it comes to Minnie, classic Mickey seems to be more of a gentleman instead of a reckless romantic dum dum as seen here.
There is only so many times you can abuse your animation budget until you are just given tons of money from the get go.
Awesome! Love you Disney! You're the best
did not know these existed
Did you know: Alex Morgan was kicked out of Disney? I forgot why, and if you don't know who that is, she's the Striker for the US Olympic women's soccer team lol
0:07 whadda that face Mickey? You ready to get it on bro
This is hands down the best version of Mickey Mouse.
I love the little nods and tributes to other Disney movies, theme park rides, and to Walt :-)
Is it just me, or is this a lot like Spongebob?
Hey I hate my life so much I feel like I total complete failure and I feel I will never be where I need to be and be with a woman who's gonna love me also I want to make a change in my life and become know
Anybody notice the Walt Disney(the person) reference after Mickey said you'll never let me down?
If I wanted to watch Ren & Stimpy I would watch Ren & Stimpy...*sigh*...
This might be the best one yet!! When their faces peeled off..... 🤣
why is this 10th on trending?
I loved when Walt winked at Mickey\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was good. Keep it up!
Mickey and Minnie are ded.\n\nRainbow Cavern is heaven\n\n3DEEP5ME
bruh did my boi mickey just die? were they in heaven at the end?
Mickey tries to get a reservation at Club 33.
So.... They are going to heaven? 😳
Wow, its like someone took ren n stimpy and the animanics and called it mickey mouse.\nI like the classic cartoons much better.
Umm.......did they die and went  to paradise?
I hope the creators realize that ending can be interpreted as them ending up in the afterlife.
This looks like it was animated by hotdiggedydemon
Ummm… Did Mickey and Minnie die and go to heaven?\n\nCause it seemed like that at the end
That's one fast train.
Did they just die and spend the rest of existence in cavern heaven?
The Mickey Mouse Shorts are my life.
At first I thought Micky CRAZY! But he isn't XD 8D
We all know what happened when the screen turns black wink-wink-nudge-nudge
You're killing me Disney! God this is what I've wanted for the longest time :')
Big Thunder Mountain in the Frontier Land with the Little Wooden Head and Rainbow Cavern song. Duh.\nWalt guaranteed LoL
I thought they became ghosts for a second
How does Minnie have a bae and I don't
Maybe a Mickey Mouse cartoon episode called the Switcheroo,the reason why it’s called the switcheroo because in this episode (Mickey and Donald switch body when they found a body swapper then their bodies started to switch arms,legs,feet and heads and the bodies and the clothes when they came out of the machine they saw each other with their bodies switched,then Mickey started to reverse the effect of the body swap then it went completely wrong every citizen’s bodies began to switch,but at the end...they all turn back to normal.
Cuphead.. there I said it
Micky sounds like cosmo from fairy god parents.
If it was only like the old animations
You follow the map and I'll follow you kinda sexist no
Even though I turn 15 in 2 Days, I still enjoyed this! 🙂
The our troubles are all behind us joke at 1:57 would have been funny if it wasn't spoonfed by Mickey repeating the phrase. I understood the joke as soon as I saw the railroad come tumbling down from behind them. I understand that this may be intended for all ages, but subtle humor would still be great every now and then.
Did they just kiss 😄
Mikey and Minnie must be pros at Cup Head.
So, at the end they die... the end up in a kind of heaven... a place they are safe...
When Mickey and Minnie threw all the coal in the furnace including a shovel that was a reference to Disney's American Legends Casey Jones where the exact same scene happens! Hope I'm not the only one who saw this.
2.38 big thunder mountain railroad roller coaster reference
The animation makes me think of hotdiggedydemon.
CupHead has ruined this for me
This looks less Disney and more hotdiggydemon to me...\nDefinitely not a bad thing :-P
First time watching one of these shorts. Little too fast paced, but not as bad as I was expecting them to be. Pretty good!
1:36 is this a splash mountain refrence?!
Wonderful video! A real joy to watch!
Giving credit where it's due: you are entirely willing to throw in the bizarre.
will this be in kh3
It’s based of the attraction at Disneyland that closed lol
Aye if u burned Minnie's skirt instead of the map it would have taken you all the way to Disney Land
These are  F A N T A S T I C
This needs to be a movie
Wow this was awesome!! Love the Disneyland references
Funny thing this short gave me SERIOUS nostalgia from this one stage in Epic Mickey 2
I think the new ride in Disney World will be similar to this.
Beautiful 💜
😀
0:10 sexual joke??
did they die?
Hardest Cuphead boss.
NOOOO NOT CALIFORNIA!
Runaway Railway
So funny
Aww thats too cute

This ain't cuphead?
Walt Disney would be proud 🤧😋
*rainbow caravans*......................................... *sigh* . *walks out on everybody* I QUIT!
Cuite
Wait... Did they die and go to hell?
What
Wait I thought Minnie was his sister
By combining Amy Adams and Ana Kendrick, you'll get Isla Fisher lol
I love both Isla Fisher and, Amy Adams, The satire is funny due to the irony.
Both of them are so beautiful and talented.
Amy Adams killed it in Wedding crashers!!
Clark Gable and George Clooney look the same
i don't think they look anything alike?
waiting for that content deputy...
Those stories seem way too contrived for me..but hey don't let the truth get in the way of a good story lol
She looks and sounds nothing like Amy Adams.
SHE HAS AN ACCENT???
Id rather say she looks like Anna Kendrick
The Rock is NOT Dwayne Johnson
I get them mixed up too.
Jenna Fischer looks more like Amy Adams than Isla Fisher.
This is definitely a thing. she was like, for the next 5 minutes, I will be Amy Adams for you.
who are you then
Great to finally hear Amy Adams address this.
They're both smokin' hot but Isla wins for looks.  Amy is a better actress.
I have an entire list of celebrities that I cant tell apart cause they look the same and isla fisher and amy adam are on the top of that list
I'm sooo stoned all I heard was I love Fischer and now I'm hungry for a burger.
For some reason I used to get Rachel Weisz and Kate Winslet mixed up.
How can people confuse them? One is really beautiful and one is hideous.
And Marilyn Manson is not VALAK!
so is isla fisher amy adams?
Amy Adams is hot af
Jimmy Kimmel is not a young Tom Hanks
Amy Adams is the talented one, thats how I tell them apart :)
she's speaking a mix between american irish and british english .. so weird ..
I remember when I was watching Hot Rod I kept on just staring at her face swearing it was Amy Adams but feeling like something was off.  It took my friends insisting that it wasn't for me to look up Isla Fisher.
Yes. Also Zooey Deschanel and Katie Perry are not the same person either!
omg, they are actually two different people
Am i the only one who heard the Jaimy Kammel?!
She's such a hottie!
How about Jojo from the Bachelor? 😂😂😂😂
I watched The Wedding Crashers, Isla helped me realize I have a thing for crazy chicks.
Naomi Watts is not Nicole Kidman\nJessica Chastain is not Bryce Dollas Howard\nSelma Hayek is not Penelope Cruz\nIsla Fisher is not Amy Adams :)
WAIT I didn't know she had a Aussie accent
I actually needed this cause for the longest time I really did think they were the same person. Thanks Jimmy
How can people confused these two?They absolutely look different people
I'd die happy with a three some with these 2 fire crotches
So they got da same baby daddy, but different mama drama?
It wasn't Lady Gaga at all, but Amy Winehouse in disguise...
I feel like Amy Adams is hotter for me. Who agrees.
Women’s stories are terrible lol. Please prove me wrong
My wife does this! She teases me because she claims I have a bit of a crush on Amy Adams. Every time we watch a movie with either of them in it, she says it's a movie with my woman in it. She quite literally can't seem to tell them apart.
my left nut is not my right nut!! They may look alike but each nut has its own individual characteristic! Stop generalizing/being nut-cist! Every nut is different and special!
I could never be a celeb, I'd be so scared of misidentifying someone, I'd just ignore everyone at parties.
She is smoking hot until she opens her mouth and that damn Australian or kiwi accent comes out
Amy Adams and Isla Fisher looks like twins i love them both
wow they so forgot about Jenna Fischer who is literally more like Amy
And the world is going to hell but hey! You all better stop confusing these two!
hollywood is all about transgenderism.
She's so cute!!!
She looks a lot like Debra Messing too!
Isla I loved you in confessions of a shopaholic!
Bryce Dallas Howard looks great in this video.
She looks like Jojo from The Bachelorette too! or Jojo looks like her... anyway, that!
I think a good reason why they get mistaken for each other (aside from the obvious features) is because along with all that they have on common, they have very similar facial structure. If one had a slimmer or rounder face they might not have the problem as bad
This would have been so funny if they were able to get amy adams to swap in between cuts in the same outfit for one shot.
Reminder: we need more of Isla Fisher in film.
They do look alike....she married to Borat!
All three are beautiful women but maybe if you see them without makeup you might get confused 🤷‍♀️
For one she is a better actress than Amy Adams whom I've NEVER seen give a good performance
They look sssssooooo alike thodugh how could you not mistake her for amy adams
3:10 when you come at any of us huehue..
I liked her in The Office.
They are both beautiful, but no one is hotter than Isla Fisher.
are either one of those Pam from the office or is that a different person too
Hey man all thots look the same in the eyes of jesus
Why are most or all gingerheads so hot?
They are both beautiful and talented, right up there with my beautiful wife.
I love Isla! There is no way I'd mistake her for Amy. Not to mention, they don't even have the same color eyes. What's wrong with people?
So....Jessica Alba isn't the rock?
I loved Amy Adams in the confessions of a shopaholic
They look nothing alike other than hair, and even that isn't that similar.
Thoughts on Ricegum and iDubbbz on my page with some gameplay! Check it out!
Sound like she made up that story about singing at Ikea. Totally lying.
*We need one with Keira Knightley and Natalie Portman* 😊
I ❤ Isla Fisher.
Amy Adams 😍
Isla Fisher > Amy Adams.
But is she Jenna Fisher?
Wait!! Then, who’s jenna fischer? 😅
Damn she's funny
I am not Jessica Chastain
romance sure conduct cyhmybq little weight decent start record starter absence
Peliculas de clint isgod
She also looks like Jenna Fischer
Isla fisher = no tits. Amy Adams = Big tits.....?
Well duhh
jimmy kimmel can suck my cock
Both are hot
I am not Jessica Chastain anyone? 😂
Bruce Jenner- jimmy same comparison
Herbert Love hates this.
All hot. FU jimmy kimmel
Kirstie Alley is not Kristen Johnston
Are you sure?
Isla is my babe
Kaia Gerber is NOT Rachel Bilson

Hey Soph! So I live in New Zealand, and as a fan of yours I was super interested in purchasing both palettes as they look absolutely incredible and so versatile! Is there anywhere else I can purchase your palettes other than tambeauty? Unfortunately the shipping is 20 pounds (more than both of the palettes combined) :( I adore your videos and I would love to purchase both of your palettes if the shipping wasn't so expensive! Perks of living so far away, but congratulations on such a successful launch, you've done an amazing job :)

YALL NEED TO GET CUBE ON THIS SHOW ASAP

This is my first time seeing this but I have to ask, Why in the hell is there such a thing as 2 million plus heat rating in food? Like so many questions come to mind!
terry crews is such a dad and i love it so much
Terry Crews is the fucking goat
This is the best EP of Hot Ones yet!
Yet another reason to like terry crews. But also hand it to the interviewer. Good questions, no interruptions. Good interviewer
Put Arnie on the show
Loool The Terry Crews Old Spice add just popped up before this video😂🙌🏾
I think I would have no problem with this...the only one I would be worried about is the bomb....i have that in my fridge right now lol. I also eat ghost pepper mustard regularly and I'm about to do the #onechipchallenge by the end of the month! Hey Sean Evans....PLZ let me come on the show!!!
I'd like to see this show interview politicians as well.
all i’m sayin is this host would be a great trip sitter
Watching a Terry Crews commercial before this
He is a treasure we need to protect him.
Terry Crews  -  what a great attitude  -  love it.  Another great episode!!!
How can you not LOVE Terry? I feel bad for him to go through this though.
Oh my god, i love this! This is my first time watching your show and i already fell in love with it! Yeah, this another reason to love terry crews, such a wonderful wonderful guy..so down to earth! Love you man!
He turns orange the farther they get lol

This guy is a chameleon. Natural and made for the camera. Great interview.
I hate to see terry in pain he's such a sweet guy
It would be really cool if they could get Nolan North on the show
Terry is so nice, what a great guy
Is it just me, or do the wings look darker than usual?
He didn't even bite the spot where the last dab was. This is my first comment on any youtube video ever. Thats how you know I'm upset.
You need Gabriel Iglesias on the show.  Hopefully fluffy loves the hot stuff.
Do Dwayne the rock Johnson
Anybody else get a terry crews old spice add ??? lol
Get Arnold Schwarzenegger On The Show.
Please get Bam Margera on this show if you haven't alredy, that dude is such a legend especially to skaters.
Do the sheldon guy from the big bang theory
Some of the best content on the Tube, along with NumberSixWithCheese
Funny dude love this guy. I'm getting High of this shit 😂
Tyler the creator Next?!?!?!
Anyone else get an old spice commercial
A terry crews ad was on before the video on old spice
If there is anything Terry can inspire anyone to do....is to be a father like him. I watched this only hoping to hear about his computer project I followed while he build it. #Terry#1Dad
How can 1000 people dislike this? You must be Isis members and WITH that being said. You don't deserve Terry crews! This guy is the best!!
I love when someone I actually like and want to see on the show eats actual chicken wings with bones. Fuck nuggets, fuck tenders and fuck vegan/vegetarian chicken!!
Clicked on the video and immediately dropped the volume to around 50% just in case.
do ski mask the slump god or xxxtentacion or both
Terry is the best, never change bro!
once those bars got red this shit got pretty funny.
God,  I love this man
lol ima start watchin brooklyn 99, mad love for terry man, keep up the hustle!
I want to see will Smith on this
Best episode of Hot Ones
Crazy thing is that the acting looked pretty damn real
Always loved Terry. Loved him more with his Jayztwocents colab...now love him even more.
Terry and Charlemagne are in my top fave
Terry Crews seems like a very good dude.  Nice to hear about fathers who give a shit about their kids interests.
he didnt mention Jayz2Cents on his custom old spice pc build?
Literally the first time I click on this video, and I get a fucking Old Spice ad.
the host needs to check himself w a doctor I knew someone that got throat cancer from eating too much spice
I haven't laughed so hard and quietly in a long time.
I got the shakes that'll make you quake
I'm watching while high so that effect at 15:44 was so cool! Awesome episode man! xoxox
16:04 reminds me of the old spice commercials
Who else got a old spice ad that had terry in right when you clicked on the vid
What a sincere, caring and grateful man. Nothing but respect for him.
I just got a Terry Crews Old Spice ad on a video with Terry Crews in it the universe is going to explode
Sort of hate the 9ers now... :(
Mac Miller would be amazing to see on the show <3
I find Terry Crews ... so hot, hot and hot.
Are the hot sauces in the wrong order? The website of Zombie Apocalypse Ghost Chili Hot Sauce  says  Aprox. 500,000 Scoville units
He didn't eat the sauce on the last wing
Terry was great!!!!! I learned so much more about him. I feel like he should have a biopic movie now. He has such a great story to tell about overcoming obstacles & reaching Victory! Watching Terry reminded me of Mike Tyson...he would be great on the show next.
He seems so nice for a body triple my size lmao
Goddamit... that was my favourite episode so far by far. What a wonderful interview. Mr. Crews seems like a fantastic man. I may have a new hero in my life. Let's add him to my list...\n\n\n\n1. ONE\n2. Donald Glover \n3. My boss\n4. My mom\n5. *Terry Crews*
I want to kill myself and no one can talk me out of what i wanna do
Any y’all remember when Terry said in the longest yard\n\n“Gotta protect dem McNuggets!”
Please put black bear on the show please
lol he faked the last one
my man
Such a great Fucking dude!
10:18 THE FLeX

HOW IS THIS GRANDPA STILL SWOLE
Do grant gustin
Keyboards and mouses?!? lolses
Such a wholesome guy
He’s awesome
i bet it tastes like a scam.
Stupid people always find ways to part with their money
that guy is gonna buy so much weed
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily fromNarodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.
This is why people mock R&M fans.
This man is a genius, rip off the idiots! DO IT
I bet it tastes like reddit
I imagine that last guy looks like the average R&M fan
A true entrepreneur.
Someone please tell me this is a joke 😂😂
cringe fucking man-children betas get your nuts cut off
This nu-male, chewing like a fucking cattle with the same bland look, is the face of the intelligent part of America.\nDisgusting.
You can see the face of regret on that fat neckbeard's face lol.
Oooweee, what did you do this Saturday? \n\nHopefully you didn't stand in a McDonalds all day and waste your life
I don't know whats grosser, paying 10 bucks for a chicken nugget meme or eating food that's being handled by some stranger. Like why couldn't they dip it themselves? so gross
America was a mistake.
they are eating out of the same hand that just handled a $10 bill that has probably been inside of someone's ass
the guy who ate it looks exactly like the type of guy who would pay that much for a scam
this wouldnt happen in communist russia
this is the world ancaps want
c l o w n \n\nw o r l d
Picked up money put it his pocket then grabbed a nugget with the same dirty hand and dipped it!! Disgusting person I've ever seen!!! Insane people!
If this is true...idiots are paying why???? (I guess because we have the part of society which is curious or just love to waste money on a dumb thing because they can or want to be part of a stupid experience).\n\nIf it's false. Well I guess it would make sense why they done this. We live in a time where a fake video about an extreme thing can get to the eyes of millions of people where they question if it's real or not.
Rick & Morty is not entertaining.
wow such negativity in the comments. This is just basic supply and demand.... low supply, real high demand = high prices. if you truly feel strongly about people spending their money unwisely then you should go voice you opinion about the average american taking out a loan to buy a car.
fucking rick and morty fans ruining a show
When the guy with glasses started to eat his nugget the expression on his face looked like he suddenly realized he wasted $10 on something completely stupid.
$10 to taste the sauce that is a steal! Tried to get that for $5 each fry dipped in the sauce but t'was too late by the time I reached the front of the line. Fuck. Now we wait for them to bring back the szechuan sauce permanently.
For those who don't understand this. The guy has got a pot of what is called Szechuan Sauce which has been brought back for a limited time to McDonald’s by the TV show 'Rick and Morty'. Due to its limited availability this guy is capitalising on its rareness and is selling each chicken nugget which have been dipped in the sauce for $10
He'd make a great pharma CEO
WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB I LOVE MCDONALDS PICKLE RICK\n\n^The voice of an enlightened high IQ gentleman
Unless he sold a min of 23 nuggets dipped he earned less than going rate on eBay
Next time film in a horizontal format....I can't see shit.  What a waste of technology.  You have no command over your mobile device.
This guy's life motto: I have noooo idea
so this.... is the power.... of rick and morty huh?\nnot bad...
We need an extinction event
Wanna know how to get your hands on the Szechuan Sauce?\n\nMake that shit or go to just about any damn cheap Chinese fast food joint or restaurant and you'll find a very similar tasting sauce to dip your food in. Saves you hours of standing in line like a fool and communicating to your fellow R&M fans with nothing but PICKLE RICK!! and/or TIME TO GET SCHWIFTY YEYEYEYEYYEYE until its your turn, only to find out that the McDonald's has run out of the special sauce.
What fuck is wrong with people.
How much for a bite out of him?! <3
Look at these derpy idiots with too much money on their hands.  Morons
I'm usually pretty open minded about things and not be too judgmental about what people do, no matter how ridiculous it may seem.  To each their own, whatever floats your boat. You know how it goes.  Just let them be.   But these people are fucking morons to the highest degree.
Example of dumb Americans.
bunch of niggers
Rick and Morty fans are fucking retards
Oh fuck off.
Rich and Morty is fucking retarded.
fucking clowns
idiots
efuck
ITS THE LAST MCRIB!
Rick would be proud
What a fucking faggot
Soliciting inside the store? WTF?
YO BROOO IS IT WORTH IT
Hey, Aids Skrillex got a haircut!
Redditors need to be stopped.
Capitalism
Lol!!!
no life fucking nerds that depend so heavily on a fucking tv show to have social interactions.
MORTY I TURNED MYSELF INTO A WOMAN! IM TRANNY RICK!!!
pickle rick!!! lmao haha
These people are the lowest scum in our society. We need to ignore them as they are irrelevant.
This sums up the degeneration of western society wonderfully.
smart man
Stupid fat arse Americans.
ARE WE NOT MEN? \nWE ARE DEVO!
Daddy's credit card money well spent
smh. You can literally make this shit yourself. What fat fucks.
Omg, you are so cool for making fun of a cartoon that tackles hard topics to make into comedy and succeeds, you must be so smart for making fun of a smart cartoon. You're the best of all the other people who thought by getting angry at a cartoon that using science as a comic device somehow makes you superior, fuck the people that enjoy the comic relief of real scientific conundrums!
People like him make me sick
Am I the only one who noticed how he has even more cuts on his hands it makes me so sad TT

Anyone notice the wierd way he ttalks
When this guy stops speaking with the strangest inflection, he sounds pretty normal.
Your voice made me triggered
His voice tho
Thumbnail looking scrumptious
#11 US Trendingg
11 trend wp :D
Speak normally
Would parafin be okay instead of beeswax?
this remind me of kaori miyazono T_T
I thought canele' had cinnamon (canela).
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
lookin good
I have honeybees
AmeriCanelés!
How bout a popover pan?
Hardware store checklist:\n-microplane\n-blowtorch\n-bees wax\n\n...mind your own bees wax
Make edible (safe) cookie dough!
Congratulations on trending my favorite chef!
This dude sounds like kipkay
This dude woke af lol
I loooooove caneles!!!
The way speak ....you and Christopher Walken need to go bowling!
I'll break my plant based diet for this
you talk in such wierd intervals...
Why does this guy talk with page breaks
Oh, stop it! I'm fasting today!
Hate the way he talks
oh my god thank you so much i always buy canelés as a treat from dominique ansel's but now i can just make them myself!!!
I kind of get a binging with babish vibe from this
His inflection is annoying, it sounds like everything he's saying is the last thing he's saying, but its  not
This is trending on #11 good job chef john
Who taught you to speak? Tommy Wiseau?
Those are so good! And so expensive. Like 2€ or more a piece. I had to learn how to make them. Wish I had found this video years ago.
Your pronunciation of the treat was wrong.
YOU MADE IT ON TRENDING
These look yummy... he has a very repetitive rhythmic way of speaking... it was really noticeable. Up, down, up, down, up, down... other than that, he has a very pleasant speaking voice/tone.
Lol in the way he talks is funny
It’s like mini Dutch Babies....
Woooow look at how fast this is trending
I can only find 100% beeswax candle from wholefood, not sure if its safe to eaf but it turns out amazing nonetheless!
I shouldn't be watching this while hungry
i love how explain it you stop and breath and talk again
His voice got me shook. But I kinda love it
I heard people that eat these are kinda gay...as in happy.
I actually like his voice
YOUR LIE IN APRIL!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
add me on snapchat and start a streak @ewannebo
Wtf is up with THE stOve
i dont really like sweets but wow those look nice and i think id love to make them
I made them with coconut rum and coconut milk. They came out great
Does anyone else notice the inflections in his voice as he is talking?....its kinda sing-song-ey
why not just add the milk cold instead of tempering
Caneles are WONDERFUL! Good on you for thinking to use a muffin tin. I've been using the molds, but didn't have any beeswax. I'll keep looking for it from your tips on where. My sister requests these for Christmas present!
So basically a sweet Yorkshire Pudding that can double as a candle. LOL Kidding...they look lovely!
Chef John on trending. What a time to be alive
Chef John, my (family member) is allergic to (main ingredient). Do you have any reccomendations on how i should make this dish without (main ingredient)?
you're on trending, chef john!
I want an hour long video of Chef John scraping crispy pastries. The sound is pleasing beyond words.
Why does he talk like that.
Looks Deeelicious!! Any alternatives for the bees wax?  Safe for digesting ... I wonder.
Never heard of such a thing...now I cannot stop thinking about them.
Well done you!!...yet another culinary 'myth'  laid bare and made 'do-able'  !! Good cooking is about putting good ingredients  together  with love and enthusiasm. ...add a little bit of practice  and 'voila' !! Thankyou...again!! From Sharon, in Nottingham, England!! (ex-cookery teacher!).
Thanks for this chef! I wanted to make something different for my Capstone project this quarter in culinary school and now I get to try this out. My baking teacher is a very traditional master chef from Europe who is not a fan of anything new or different. However I know this classic is one of his favorites. Here comes and A+ for me lol.
Chef John is the only person in existence I cannot imagine being mean to.
Fuck you, stop making me hungry. I can’t handle the tasty looking food
All I need is rum.
Chef John I tried it and it didn't really work...the first mixture was always kinda dry :( and i think it kinda ruined everything...we ate the result anyway but...:( so tell me how long did it take you to make the first mixture look alright? thanks!
I was thinking u cud do these in ur popover tin!!
I haaatee that crisp sound test 💔 it makes me drool
These look tasty.  Seems like they could do with some kind of sauce, but maybe that would be overkill.
a pinch of cayenne no chef ?😂😂😂
No they aren't as pretty but, really, how often would one need to make these to warrant buying a specific pan for them? I don't want that thing crowding my kitchen storage. Short and fat wins
Million food videos on YouTube. How the fuck do some get #13 trending with tons of views so quickly?? How do you hack YouTube to make that happen??
I didn't know you could eat beeswax
I'm on a diet
I am making these right now for my pregnant wife
Hey Chef John, how about trying the Portuguese “Pastel de Nata” now that is a big reward to the challenge.
Chef John... You're #13 on trending!! Never been more proud to be a fan of you 😄
What's the background music called?
Turned out really nice, great job. I'm sure they were just as delicious.
Chef\nWhen you going to make kouign aman ?????
Hi! Loved your video. Where did you buy your beeswax? Thank you!
Love the voice... 👏😊
This Guy lied to us! He made more than 6! He ate more than 4! He gave himself away when he said “ serve next to a pot of coffee!”
This guy sounds like Kermit The Frog
This guy talks like a robot... hahaha
Absolutely brilliant Chef John!
Be careful where you source your food grade beeswax from. It seems like a lot of sellers on places like Amazon are contaminating their products (buyers complain of it smelling like cigarette smoke), they aren't regulated, and could be adding things to their product to not make it edible. Actually if you search for food grade beeswax there's not many options.
Can someone explain exactly how the beeswax would work to produce the canele? Does it act like a grease? In which case are there substitutes?
I wanna see you squish and mash one of these with a fork with the sound on
I was so anxious to see what they looked like on the inside.. and it was such a pleasant surprise. I will be making these soon. Thank you.
I love you and custard
I love how at the end of his sentences he says it like he's leaving it at a cliffhanger
Excellent! I'd want to put a dollop of something in the depression. I don't know what though.
NO WE'LL HEAD TO the stove... AND APPLY OUR BUTTER TO the sauce pan... AND WE'RE GONNA KEEP THAT AT medium heat... that's how he talks. All the time.
Oooooooo.....delicious!  I would like to make these.  I've made similar custard cakes; portuguese style called queijadas \nfrom the azores.  Maybe you could do a video on such pasteries.  Thank you for sharing.  Lucilia, Somerville, Ma.  ******
I'm pretty sure the addition of beeswax means these are technically furniture.
Whyyyyy is this on trending???
How the fuck is a 96k viewed video posted a day ago is on the YouTube trending page?
You don't happen to  have an awkward puberty photo do you?\nI don't...I'm afraid I looked really Good...BUT I do have an awkward puberty VIDEO!!!  This guy though.
Why am I only now noticing how hot Manuel is?
These numbers had me on a superstitious roller coaster man
Is it just me or is there something other-worldly awesome about Lin Manuel Miranda?
Gracias! You are a blessing!
Damn right, DAMN RIGHT!!
Bless you Stephen, Knoll, and CBS.
LIN!
aww! cute
A million dollars and you didn't even get them a trophy? Sad.......
lin has done more than trump
Lin-Manuel Miranda is a gosh-darn world treasure.
can i join i'm still going through puberty though
This warms my heart and brings tears to my eyes. Im in Puerto Rico and I love Stephen Colbert, Lin Manuel, Nick Kroll, The Americone Foundation!! It means everything! GRACIAS!!
An Ice cream never gives up ... until it has completely melted! ;)
All the confetti etc is treating fundraising for disaster relief like winning a gameshow. Puerto Rico isn't winning a game show. This is just like when Trump threw the paper towels and stuff into the crowd.
24-30fps for like 13 seconds is a lot of money
Thank you, as a Puertorriqen who still is trying to hear from my family.  God bless everyone who helps my beautiful island brothers and sisters. I pray my relatives are safe and healthy.
I started crying out of happiness. I have so much family in Puerto Rico. Thank you
omg, been watching colbert for years.... noticed his right ear jutting out like that for first time! hahaha love him!
Nice use of The Muffs Kids in America cover
Americans love to congratulate themselves don't they lmao
this story will be one that is told for years to come.. of how a late night tv show host did more to help a horrific tragedy then our own president .. this was an amazing thing to see
Jon Batiste's voice is the most annoying susbtance known to man.
Ending it with a puber video of puerto rico is too perfect. This must have been thought out all at once. Wven the numbers synched up perfectly. They knew the end game from the begining.
LIN CUT HIS HAIR OMG NO
Oh my God 😂❤
Much respect! 💨🌊🌧 relief.
HI BABY
LOVEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!! #PuertoRicoRelief!
He looks like Evil Abed
5:10 666,000 ? wake up sheeple, don't you realize it yet? The 666? The eye? smh.\n6:40 999,000 ? 999? That's just an inverted 666. what's next?\n\n\n\n\ncan't believe not many people made this comment yet, knowing the internet.
How about a photo of Donald Trump?
i still do not understand this great job thing. i know it has to do with a podcast, but for him to do it everywhere? is he just a really huge fan of the show and it is a shoutout? i mean, how does a visual even come from a podcast??
THE GREAT JOBS ARE FLYIN!! HES A MADMAN!! 👋🏼👋🏼
$666000 huh classic illuminati can't help themselves
Lin’s video was basically the plot of in the heights
More than the billionaire gave to them
Wow Lin looks like he regretted that
Now I can't stop see Lin-Manuel's big nose.
Director Ron Howard wanted to participate but couldn't find any pics of himself as a child or teenager.
That's a lot of couch change
My face is struggling to catch up with my nose. LMAO
Who knew ice cream paid so well? or is this maybe more of a direct donation than that? in any case, awesome, and good on CBS for stepping up, too!
Lin just walking in like a lost tourist
Perfect he had a puberme video of Puerto Rico!
Kroll said he would match it himself....liar
Wow, half of that won't ever land in Puerto Rico, guaranteed you MF's! Go there, do something real .... You couldn'd care less about N Orleans; Houston; the massive populated state of Florida... BTW, too many ppl in crazy Florida, get the F out - I guess they like natural disasters; just as long as the Everglades are safe (never more) I guess..

Thank you Stephen Colbert.
Amazing gave me tears of joy. 😂
This is both amazing and sad. Amazing the generous spirit of all these people. Sad how they're doing more then the AMerican government
The 118 people who disliked this video are cunts
Lin Manuel us a genius; creative, insightful, talented, charismatic, etc. Trump supporters must hate him.
AWESOME, LOVE YOU LIN MANUEL MIRANDA DIOS TE BENDIGA Y FAMILIA !!!
Such uplifting news we so desperately needed this week. <3
thank you so much for the support for my people in the Island PUERTO RICO!!! THANK YOU STEPHEN AND NICK THATS SO AWSOME!!
I want to apologize to the beautiful people in Puerto Rico for throwing paper towels. Ive been a bad Hombre.
I saw it on t.v. I HAD to check it out
I was getting really impatient when I didn't see Lin at first *but it was worth it*
I love that at present, we know exactly how many deprived cuckolds watched this wonderful clip: 96 👎👀🙊
I'm glad Lin didn't throw away his shot
This is so great.
Steven: thank you so much!!!!!! ☝❤👍💞
Think I have something in my eye, excuse me....
Lin is so beautiful. This was an incredible campaign. Amazing job Colbert and Co.
My island thanks you <3
You guys are amazing this show is the shit so thankful that there are people of all ethnicities working together to actually help Americans. This act alone tops anything our sorry excuse of a president has done and will probably ever do
I CAME AS SOON AS I HEARD
This is so great
Stephen is helping more than Trump❤️
LOVE YOU STEPHEN AND LOVE MY ISLAND!!
that is awesome. the things a unified people can do! God bless America!!!
Someone should put this video in the Trump MAGA Facebook account.  It will blow their racist minds!!!!
Lin Manuel is so good looking??
I CAME AS SOON AS I HEARD
Why is this not trending?
Lin Manuel Always looks like a 13 year old
That was painful to watch. Love you Lin 😙😙
This is what happens when you say Puerto Rico that many times...Lin Manuel Miranda manifests!
RIGGED
Great job 👏👏
GREAT JOB 👋👋👋

This Moron said Trump was going straight to hell? Does this moron Miranda even understand the amount of aid the Trump administration has given to Puerto Rico? Is it Trump's fault that PR has no trucks to move the food around? If Obama pissed on the Puerto rican flag on TV this cocksucker would praise him. What an asshole.

It's b***h
The emoji that you did not know what was is a for something called curling it is a sport for the winter
I’m sorry but wtf is a pirogi?! You mean an empanada?😭
I have news for you... even those non-gender emojis are either male or female.
Who else came to the comments to see if someone tried to comment the bad word
Will they ever make a dabbing emoji?
Dumpling/pierogi emoji is the best.\nAlso I’m impressed because Justine know “pierogi”-dumplings and this is traditional Polish food
Lol I have IOS 11 and I don’t have da emojis
Why is your channel just a big apple add, its kind of shitty😂
I think it is bit##
The stupidity I just can't
All these 2 Million + Youtube people have the same fake ass body language
😱 Oml They Have To Put These In A IPad Update!
The word is B I T C H
How are you still relevant
This my fav:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n👅 always been 👅. Never been anything besides 👅 :P
It's the b word or the (hopefully not) n word
Ugh.....I can smell the brand placement from halfway across the world...it’s annoying and fake.
Im sure the swear word is “female dog” 🤧
I think it's bitch
They should have a dab emoji
5 letter swear word could be b***h the word for a female dog, but i wouldnt really consider that a swear word.

You don't even know what a perogie is
my old emoji is 😘 and my new emoji is 🐘
I so believe it's the B word
I'm still waiting for a redhead emoji.....
I thought this was the iPhone X face emoji thing. What is this bullshit
She is a fearful hypocrite, no matter she pretends to say. Gray hair and cracked voice of some old witch from forest suits her perfect.
Amazing the guy got that close to the PM, he'd have been shot in the US.
Lucky she was in the U.K. in America it would have been a gun.
Who is this bird again?
He is not a prankster it's called the comedian
I just want to see how many people hate her and want her out. If it’s labour or green or even Lib Dem hit like to get her out. She isn’t for the people, she isn’t for the poor or middle class, she doesn’t care about anyone other than companies giving her money. HIT LIKE IF YOU WANT HER OUT WE NEED HER OUT!!
Just to clear who he was. He was lee nelson. Not his real name but now u kno who i mean
What a farce, that was a Tory setup. Your telling me the dam security never knew he was coming on? Seriously even the camera crews knew where he was sitting they zoomed in on him at the start of her speech, just waiting for his staged stunt.
She should have kicked him to bed what a weird looking idiot and why no security well done pm for carrying on regardless
We need her out
I take it everyone knows the prankster was the comedian lee Nelson?
Look at those fat slobs thumping themselves on the back... P45 is the first form they should have received
Even a software update can't save Teresa.
Id go gay for that guy! No homo.
Does it get any worse ....
Well past her sell by date...
I think half of them shouting OUT directed that towards Theresa May.
She wants to give him a p45 because she can't handle the competition?
She doesn't have any respect to people
Why does this crone always blabber on about corbyn, are there any solid beneficial ideas to be implemented for the people or is it just this childish pissing match. It's always some inept moron at the head of a witless cabinet plunging us into one disaster after another, no real progress is made from politics.
Lee nelson always up to something he’s the one who threw money over Seb platter funny guy
You can hear Brexit in the background
What an old Hag can’t  wait till she leaves
This, and other trivial things, seems to be so much more important than what the PM had to say.  NOT!
where's the secret service when you need them. Double tap to the head is all it takes
Honestly cheers to that guy
We've spent too much time talking about Jeremy Corbyn ['s past] *proceeds to talk about Jeremy Corbyn further.
Admit it, all of you thought in the title it said Ps5.....
It’s lee nelson man you blind
Does anyone know who the prankster is, I do I just forgot his name :/
that was such a dead prank
The guards probably let him get close in hopes that he would hopefully assassinate her lmao😂
Lol what a bunch of scrubs if that was white house that nerd woulda lost his teeth 10 feet in lol
OH MY GOD ALL SHE TALKS ABOUT IS JEREMY CORBIN. WHAT KIND OF POLITICS IS THIS??? SO RUBBISH
If she said something like you’re a btech sacha baron cohen his career could have been ended but she wasn’t on the ball.
Well done Simon Brodkin aka Lee Nelson the brilliant comedian does it again superb 👏👏👏👏😂😂😂😂
We all know Amber Rudd is smirking in the audience
I hate this woman
Somebody give a knighthood to that man!!!!!!!!!
Is it Lee Nelson?
Joke politicians for an even bigger joke of a nation. Merkal herself probably could run that place better than your so called Parliament.
Was that Lee Nelson again?
No copyright music for your channel, enjoy))
And  you my dear have just been served
I feel sorry for may whoever we have as prime minister is still going to be ruled by America
All she needs now is the stab in the back and the show is over.
How about you shut up about Corbyn and get on with your job and talk about your policies and plans. Or is she just going to keep complaining like a child
Saying Jeremy Corbyn should be given a P45 and when you struck a deal with a racist party to stay in power 😐
Who's ready for the UK Riots next year?
Am I the only one who recognises this dude as Lee Nelson?!
Love that theresa may would love her to touch my clit
Please take your P45 and leave Mrs May. You madam are a disaster waiting to happen and Corbin isn't any better.
She's like a broken record. Plus you have all those seals clapping at anything that comes out her mouth.
*build a country that works for rich people
I thought she tried to give Jeremy Corbyn a P45 and that's the reason her party wants to give a P45 to her.
Is it me or he looks WAY TO MUCH LIKE MATTSHEA O
Lee nelson lol what a guy
A great insight into how choreographed these conference speeches are - note that after she said We've spent too much time talking about Jeremy Corbyn's past the audience was supposed to applaud but missed the cue because everyone was distracted by the intruder, so she said you probably didn't hear it and read the line again - this time they get it right.
Another classic stunt by lee nelson cant wait to how he prepared for this 1 🤣😂🤣😂
Looks like Stephen Hawking in his prime
I'm confused what's a p45 and wtf is this vid on about
*Got no clap*\n*Cough cough* you may not have heard me...\n*Forced clap*
what that the the guy from Lee Nelson's well good show
It's a shame that comedian, doesn't have anything intelligent or useful to add. But instead resorts to the easy millennial route of just trying to make a name for yourself with cheap social media stunts.
Plot twist.....it was a real P45
bankers puppet with the lowest wit
ISIS claimed responsibility for the p45
Looks like grant from college humour!
His name is Simon Brodkin, he’s pranked things like Britain’s Got Talent and even Trump! \n\nHonestly such a funny guy.
He deserves to face a firing squad.
Thought we’d got rid of all the witches after maggie thatcher, but I guess not🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
yerno it would be a different story if it was a terrorist or criminal
Somone give that man a promotion and a raise!
AHAHAHAHAHAHHHAHAHAHHHAHHA

Ayyyyy Simon Brodkin ;)
OMG that's Lee Nelson.
Simon brodkin
She has nightmares about corbyn
DO IT! DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!
Nobody realises this is Lee Nelson... Haha
Long live the tories
I love a good prank! lol
The media was all for her and the conservatives now the are all for Corbin. Bunch of jokers the media
There would be grave consequences for doing something like this in North Korea or China.

You can tell that someone is very passionate about their project when there's a behind the scenes video for the behind the scenes video.

Can yo please take this to one of those flash restaurants or hotels were an usher will park you car for you. just give them your keys and sit back and laugh. This would be awesome to watch.
I'd jack my cock in that car and let the jizz float to the top.  Then a guy could skim it off the water and feed it to some niggers or Muslims lol
He has that mad scientist laugh lmao
Is... Is the steering wheel gonna get damp? \nThat made me smile so much hearing the little guy say that! Not sure why hahaha
What practical use does this have lol
I kid you not Colin, I found this particular video absolutely fucking hilarious and if I so happened to be in your neighbourhood, I'd shake your hand sir!
thank You for making and sharing this video. Great job!
How much you wanna bet that one guy peed
Make a giant security system
Imagine a car like that but with the rest of the body still intact. None of the water would spill out! Although getting in and out might be a problem without a hole in the roof or something...

Take it into the car wash
scuba diving in a car full of water and driving
You could made a box to your legs between the wheel and the floor of the car were inside of it would be isolated and only would have air, then when the water leak in thru your legs you could just make a hole at the floor of this box to make the water leak out from the car
You could say that the engine...got flooded.
6:54 I bet the guy in the car behind him was like 0_0
Could you imagine the look on the cops face if he ever gets pulled over in this?

For a future video I thought it would be really cool to convert the bmw into like a boat. Because it is already watertight you could leave it empty of water and raise the intake and exhaust above the top of the car and then you can drive it into a lake.
You won't see this in a proper video
Colin you should have a car which drops lighter fluid and then sparks it so it’s like ghost rider 👻 🚗 🔥

Dang they've changed I haven't watched sorted food for like a year..
You should level up *MAC AND CHEESE* next!
What wine did you use?
you guys should level up mac and cheese
I love sauce made out of red vine and balsamic vinegar (reduced, obviously) and then thickened with dark chocolate ( not cold butter). best for Steaks
I can't believe this week is gonna end without you guys getting sauced :(
level up something with pumpkin, but start from raw pumpkin please.
You drowned the ice cream oh no ;w;
What's a golden syrup?
Btw, why doe everythingin the last few weeks feel more... Rushed i guess? No mistery box, less banter, no costumes... I liked the way fridgecam was before.
Since you guys are brits why don't you try to level up fish and chips? Not those unique new fancy ones but the basic battered fish with thick cut chips. Yeah,try to level that up please.
This will quickly become a Sonoma County California Wine Country favorite!! What type of wine varietal to you choose to use for this?
What if i don't have golden syrup? What else can I use?
So.. where can we find a fudge-sauce-covered-Barry?
How about leveling up a quesadilla? Maybe some pulled pork?
This looks amazing! I have to try this!
Or put it on Mike 👌
OR for a super yummy, super thick healthier chocolate fudge sauce just melt equal parts butter, brown sugar, cocoa powder, golden syrup and water. Mix then add to the microwave for 10 second bursts until the sugar is dissolved. Can make as much or as little sauce as needed 👍🏼👍🏼 Your welcome!

(The Great and terrible Day of the Lord. When Jesus comes back to take up his bride and punish the UNREPENTANT Sinners of this Earth.

That's a terrible thumbnail
Level up some regular plebby Hash Browns into a dreamy (possibly cheesy) masterpiece!
Please level up pork crackling!!
Dang she thicc 👀
So sweet of Mathew to wake you up like that!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
It honestly baffles me that some people find the motivation to put actual clothes on when they're not going to leave the house
I feel a bit attacked about the microwaved tea.
I think my cats would try to eat me if they didn't get fed right away.
then....THE NIGHT ROUTINEEEEE!
You're such a go-getter, I can't beLIEVE how motivated you are. And I/we/your audience can tell that you are this productive all the time because in your daily vlogs you always get so much done. It's honestly amazing and I think you're super rad. You motivate me to quit procrastinating on crap in my life and just get on with it. Keep up the good work, but also don't forget to give yaself a break now and then, too!
You make my mornings look so unproductive 🤣🤣
i love this video SO MUCH. little barneys grumpy face when you were putting the harness on just warms my heart <3
Morning routines are one of my favorite type of videos. For some reason I find them so relaxing! 😄
I'm so impressed by how much you do in the morning and by the fact that you get yourself up to workout so early! I can hardly get myself to workout at all. \nAlso, your house is so beautiful! From the wallpaper to the tiling it's stunning.
Loved this video Helen! Although I'm so bloody jealous of how productive you are, if it's a work day I wake up about half an hour before I need to leave and if it's the weekend I stay in bed until about midday hahaha
Body looks amazing!🙌
Those black jeans! Where did you get them? 😍
Helen, this video is amazing! It's like high-production film, so well made. Loving your content as always!
Any small YouTuber's wanna help each other out? 😊❤️
I would love to see a tour of your place. Just seeing bits and pieces makes me want to see the whole thing put together!!!
Where did you get your jeans and top from? Pretty sure I didn’t see them in your misguided haul so just wondering where they were from
Your curves are to die for, darling! And your outfit in this video is stunning.
love the colours in this video so much, so PLEASING
I wish I was able to wear no makeup to the gym but my skin is horrible so I always have to wear makeup even if I'm stepping like one step out of the house
I bloody love you.
OMG YOUR HOUSE IS LIKE A DREAAAMMMM <3 I love it !
The bit with Matthew in the morning 😭😭😭 you guys are so cute

When do you do a jobby?
I love how motivational this is but realistic too. No, I wake up bright and early then I use these 10 products then I have a bath using this product then I do a 5 mile run blah blah blah. You get shit done whilst still being a babe. Love you Hel. One of my utter faves.
The push up needs to be in an arrow position rather than a T. If you stick your arms so far out you put unnecessary strain on your shoulders.
I just love your videos Helen. There’s something about you and how you film and edit your videos which makes you so unique. 💖
Omg helen you look fabulous in those jeans and shirt with the fluted sleeves 🔥
Wear is that top from??? does anyone know?? I love it!!
You get a lot done before lunch! I also feel your “pain” with a light colored pet. But the floors aren’t dark the furniture is..lol.
I’m reading Order of the Phoenix at the moment too haha
Ahhhh finally a morning routine again!!! I loved it:)
Your a busy busy bee! 🐝 Leg kick dance when your getting dressed - yes! Agreed living room always looks a mess, always replumping pillows 😂 x
Those trousers while you tidying look very sexy on you Helen! 💛💛
Those jeans look great on you.
were are your pants from? I love them!
Where did you get those jeans?! Love them so muchhh❤
You should get a new toothbrush. But other than that cool video, you're very proactive.
So well shot, love it!
I wish we had decent seasons here 😐. We have stinking hot, hot, cool, a day or two (this year we had two Mondays)  of coldish and uncomfortably hot
THOSE JEANS. I must know where
Where are your jeans from?!!  They are so nice 😍
So disciplined to workout first thing in the morning! but girl you need to have proteinafter your workout or you wont see changes!!
Those jeans on you, Helen!!!! :') <3 <3
Totally off topic but where did you get your couch? Is it comfy? I've been searching for a nice one and I can't seem to figure out what is a good deal. lol
I love your home it's so cool. Luv from California
Great job, Helen! love the quality and effort 💕
The only thing i want to know is how long all of this actually takes you to do 😊 i struggle to get things done in the morning
Maff is a gem, you’re insanely motivated and inspiring, and my fav part is Lola peeling out on her walk.☺️
Where are those new pants from? 😍
Helen how have I not found your channel before, god you are a breath of fresh air! Loving your videos xx
Fab video! You look absolutely gorgeous 😍 also twinning with those white boots, I absolutely LOVE mine 😍
Does anyone know what camera Helen is using? :o\nI always found it's such great quality hhh
Gotta know where the jeans are from 😍😍😍
Love those jeans, where are they from?
this was so nicely filmed and narrated, it's like the perfect mix of casual and chatty, but still filmed in a professional way yknow
You have such a nice body Helen💜 not to sound like a creepy weirdo lol but you do
Babes that black outfit is banging on you. You have such a nice shape
this is so motivating wow! thank you☺️ i’ve set my alarm for half 5 so i can do yoga in the morning. please do an autumn night time routine ☺️💓
This video is so pretty
Please do a jeans haul! It's so hard to shop for jeans 💖\n\nLoving your morning videos 🖒
I need to take note from this!!! On my days off I struggle to get out of bed before midday - and days when I'm going somewhere I usually give myself half an hour to get ready😩 What sort of time is it usually when you're at the point of makeup done, gym done, editing done etc, & ready to go out and get on with your day? 💖
GOsh I love these kind of videos theyre suuuper entertaining
i don't know what it is about this video, but it was gooooorgeous!! love it
Ahh where did you get your jeans??? They're so nice. Love your vids xx
I leg dance my way through life ;)
Where are your black jeans from? They are so cute.
Them jeans look so good on you!
Love your outfit in this- gorgeous!
This is legit your morning routine....I watch your daily vlogs to vouch for you!!! God I feel like a creep!!! Good woman yourself, getting up that early ...my heroine!!!
If I didn't feed my dogs as soon as I wake up there would be riots in my house! XD
YOUR DOGGIES!!!! I had no idea you had a pug! 😍😍😍😍 Also I've been loving The Body Shop's Vanilla Pumpkin body butter-- it smells amazing and its instantly hydrating 😊
Where did you get those jeans? And the shirt? Haha overall super cute outfit!!!
I'm obsessed with your editing and how your footage looks. It's shot so beautifully. I really appreciate your work.
Also where are those black lace up jeans from :o ??
This really motivates me to sort out my morning routine and start the day right 😁
Omg your house Is a goal..would you malé housetour?
The way you filmed this video is simply amazing! It's so well done and gives the feeling of a beautiful movie! Everything you do has just the best quality
You're looking great Helen, all that hard work at the gym is showing xx
Dear lord, I class it as a productive day if I get a few of your morning things done 😐\nNeed to get in a routine like this :')
How is that just one morning?! Looks like a flipping whole day for me
this video is really beautifully shot x
I honesty love morning routines, they are so motivating! This is amazing Helen! <3

I don't know how you are so productive all the time! 💖
Oh I got the leg kick dance DOWN #thunderthighs 😂
you already have a morning routine for autumn? girl it's been 2 weeks
MAFF IS SO SWEET
Pleeeeeease don't use those plastic milk pods for your coffee! They're not biodegradable and they're so so harmful for the environment. Please consider drinking your coffee black (if it's good coffee you'll love it!) or making your coffee by other means. Lovely vid, all the best <3
CORRECTION: 6:49 should be *MORE* sensitive to insulin rather than the stated less sensitive to insulin
Oh shi- . Now i know why after i want always Candy or chocolate . Those Little organisms are complotting against my teeth! DAMN U MICROBIOME
I want the Size of Life and Automation sequels. This topic is great and all, but it's a story I've heard elsewhere.
Can you provide us with the links from where this info was gathered ? Some scientific links ?\n\nThx
I wish you guys would have listed the references you used. Would have been useful for an assignment.
Why would you want another persons poop inside you😭😭
do a video explaining the ending of interstellar bruuuh
Thank-you! Finally an interesting video from this channel that's about reality not science fiction. This type of video is what got this channel so popular in the first place!
Kurzgesagt: the only person who can explain the complexities of astrophysics and biology with Bowmasters graphics
6:56 I think you mean it made them more sensitive to insulin
This episode's art is probably the most slightly-disturbing-but-adorable of any so far
welcome to the new age of idiocity were people are literally shoving s*** from other people's ass up their own butts.. after I heard that there is no cure for Humanity!!!
I FUCKING HATE VIDEOS LIKE THESE CAUSE IT COULD BE GOOD BUT THEY DON'T EXPLAIN IT THURLY
There's some things I wish I didn't know, this is one of them, great video, now I'm scared as fuck.
Your body has 3 times as many Microorganisms as cells.
Great video. I have never thought about the functions of microbes in our body besides simple digestion. This theory is fascinating: it illustrates why maintaining a diverse microbes environment is crucial for our health.
Could you imagine how Osmosis Jones would look if it factored in, and depicted, the digestive system being governed by foreign microbes?
Thanks for this explanation!
keep up the good work!!!
This is the year when people litterally transplanting sh*t to cure person.
I should have listened to my mother, when she told me eat my vegetables and wash your teeths when I was a child, maybe that's why I feel tired.      (  o)_(  o).
Just to clarify, the human microBIOTA refers to the community of microbes that reside within our body, and the microBIOME refers to the genetic material that make up all the microbes in our microbiota (similar to the human genome). Sorry, I'm a huge nerd lol
POOP TRANSPLANTS ARE A THING?!? AND THEY ACTUALLY WORK??!?! HOW THE HELL YOU GONNA JUST GLANCE OVER THAT SHIT?!???!
Your videos make me fall in love with science and feeds my curiosity mind. Keep it up please. I would like to see more videos related to the built environment and artificial intelligence.
So your saying the best way to lose weight is to take a skinny persons poop and shove it up my bum? Sounds like a great idea to me. And I can help anorexic people by shoving my poop up their bums! Genius!
Its interesting what the video says, because I notice if  I eat apples consistently I begin to crave apples, however if i eat dark chocolate cookies consistently my body craves it at a certain time aswell.
When you lose weight - your body generally becomes more sensitive to insulin, not less. More sensitive to insulin means your blood glucose will go down while needing less insulin to do it.
Eat shit and not die lol
*LET'S GO KURZGESAGT FOR 5 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS!*
if someone transplants me spider poop, does that mean I can shoot webs and walk on walls?
I learn more science on this channel than at school...
This guy is AMAZING! he also asks a bit if you can send him doomsday scenarios for the universe so he can explain them.XD
Very interesting, great as always.
make a video about rohingya
Welp, it aint my fault I eat so much junk food then. Next time my parents ask my why I'm eating so unhealthily I'll tell them it's my Microbiome's fault.
I really want to find a better way to change your microbiome than eat differently and poop transplants, because those are both things most people are rather wary of.
Who would inject poo in their butt for science?
L E C H E de M A D R E
Soo it can relate with consciousness? I mean the thing makes we keep want things other than food?
People with OCD are going insane right now
I think what parents eat affect their babie especially when it comes to mcdonalds
Excuse me, but did you just call autism a serious disease? That's frankly offensive.
Interesting this is funded by Bill Gates.
Possible correction: the stool transplant made them MORE sensitive to insulin, not less, since its associated with weight loss.
i created shit~gami~sama to laugh about my shit problwms, but now i know there is a real shitgami qho can cure anything by taking shit
But where is the duck?
So we're literally microbs on earth then :D
Your animations look so amazing. How this drawing style is called?
In the NUTSHELL with Gates foundation are trying to fool us that we need transplantation of 💩 poop... REALLY!?... Next step is poop donation.
Of course you can get rid of caries. Read the studys of Weston Price for example or Ramiel Nagel. Essentially you have to eat like native people again before they were influenced by western diet.
Do a video of why north and sout corea ar splited up plssssssssssss!!!!!
Bro can you possible make a video on religion?\nOr is it too risky 😂
I was eating poutine while watching this.
These animations are always fun!
Lmao are you serious, people would rather put someone else’s shit up their butt instead of EATING LESS?!!
Some of the microbes look like penises
You mentioned Schizophrenia here.  I'd be interested to hear you guys cover this condition in a future video if possible.
kurz you and life noggin should collab. you will make good vid together
How amazing is the asian with an ancient graph of chi. It really relates in this.
make a video about the ozone layer
You lost me at the poop transplant
I was born by C-section.\n\nThat's why I'm always sick.
interesting, which means my microbiome makes my life easier and not just me.
This kind of videos, makes me wanna live. ;)
Here are some great follow up videos to watch after this (/watch?v=_4XEXr2Yd5Y) (/watch?v=yKp8-X1zZqo).
it was cute when pusheen shows up
POOP TRANSPLANTS?! Well that's a new one! 😭😂
This might be your best animation so far. Perfect
I don't get how this video can have a dislike, it's not controversial in any way, too many trolls on here
Now consider yourself as a bacteria living on this body called earth... Would we be stem cells or cancer??
My jaw dropped at the first mention of stool transplant, I thought it was a joke.
My microbiome is so organized that they came together and established communism
this video made me question myself whether am i really in control of myself ?? am i even myself ?? am i me ??  what the fuck ??
this video is about shoving your poop up other peoples butts
Burgers aren't bad. A good burger is some nice beef, a couple veggies, cheese, and a little bread. It's a pretty decent food. Don't paint it in the same image as the processed sugary garbage that makes people fat.
Why am I watching this
Poop transplant?\nMen you always learn something new watching this guy. \nGreat job dude.
Another wonderfull video i love you guys soooo much, when i get a job i will buy myself a bird!!!!!
arabic translation please
Absolutely brilliant!! Thanks :)
Quantum tunneling next
Uh... legs first during labor?

Very interesting...
There is a little cosmos in our body

eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeewwwwww-
2:40 RIP :'(
Sounds like bullshit , does anybody have sources ?
That last part tho
You guys are awesome.
Let's go rabbit hunting Elmer J. Fudd Style 😁🤣😄
Does he really draw everything ?
i'm just gonna build a barrier around a grocery store.... simple enough
Survive? Who said anything about surviving?
World didn't end in 2000, 2012 nor on 23rd sep 2017... there will b no apocalypse... so chill...
I watched the walking dead... I'm good. I'll just die.
What if a emp went off?
Question: What about vegans? There was a lot of mentioning about finding/cooking meat. So, what would the vegans/vegetarians do?
Actually, the key ingredient to surviving is Dank MEMES
I WROTE EVERY THING HE SAID BUT NOT THE CACTUS SHIT AN I GAING TO LIVE smh
If your shelter is an igloo you can build a fire. Just sayin'.
“Shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, sautee it. There's, um, shrimp kebabs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo, pan fried, deep fried, stir fried. There's pineapple shrimp and lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich... That's, that's about it.”
Day 1 of emergency situation: yo why is that guy eating bugs? We've only been off power for like...12 hrs
Why would you want to survive
Def need a lot of weed
can you make a video on how to survive an apocalypse vegan edition
So much bullshit in here
We're at the  how to survive/ how to prep for the apocalypse stage....
Or just do this.\n1) Get on phone\n2) Turn on cellular data\n3) go to www.PizzaHut.com\n4) order pizza\n5) easy
The title should really say How to survive the OUTDOORS
Find the guy of the primitive technology channel and live in glorious luxury.
I was under the impression that plenty of potentially toxic proteins retain tertiary structure even when exposed to extreme heat, aren't there things that not even boiling your water can defend you against?
The best option, in my opinion at least, is to die. That's it, just die. Don't try to survive. Who needs to survive when you can end your suffering earlier? Okay, I'm not being serious.
Back to the Barter System.
if there is a god please don't let there be a real life Preston Garvey.....
its a good thing I have a mealworm colony...
I’ll save this for when WW3 happens
When you are vegan so you already know how to survive a 《terrible apocalypse》 where there are no cow milk and flesh in the super market to buy.
I don't know if you've done this before, but if you could maybe do a video about a vegan diet that would be nice!! I am a vegan and we get such a bad rep and yes there are some terrible vegans who shame others but I just want people to be healthier and animals to be happier. it would be nice to have a video from you guys proving that it isn't 'dangerous' or 'unhealthy' or whatever!
What happened to medicine? You can't have cities without medicine. *Enter the plauge*
DONT USE BIRCH BARK FOR TINDER. These trees are going extinct and stripping them of their bark is very harmful.
If I had a friend and only is a vegan I'll eat my friend tbh cause I don't got time for you eating plants plus I might not eat my friend they gonna be skinny..
But I want to die
Clothing is not essential to survival.....
But how do you boil the water in five minutes if the video's just over five minutes long?
I don't want to set the world on fire
(JESUS; THE ALMIGHTY!!!):\n\nAnd I saw heaven opened,\nand behold a white horse; \n\nand he that sat upon him\nwas called Faithful and True,\n\nand in righteousness \nhe doth judge \nand make war.\n\nHis eyes were as a flame of fire, \n\nand on his head were many crowns;\n\nand he had a name written, \nthat no man knew, \nbut he himself.\n\nAnd he was clothed with \na vesture dipped in blood:\n\nand his name is called\n\nThe Word of God.\n\n(Revelation 19:11-13). \n_________________________________________________\n\nBehold,\n\nhe cometh with clouds; \nand every eye shall see him, \n\nand they also which pierced him:\n\nand all kindreds of the earth \nshall wail because of him.\nEven so, Amen.\n\nI am Alpha and Omega, \nthe beginning and the ending, \n\nsaith the Lord,\n\nwhich is, \nand which was, \nand which is to come,\n\nthe Almighty.\n\n(Revelation 1:7-8). \n________________________________________________\n(JESUS):\n\nI am he that liveth,\nand was dead;\n\nand, \nbehold, \n\nI am alive for evermore, \n\nAmen;\n\nand have the keys \nof hell \nand of death.\n\n(Revelation 1:18). \n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(The world is going to hate us, because we follow Jesus. We follow and obey our Righteous King in our actions and deeds and the world hates us for it, because we don't form ourselves and obey the fallen king of this present world which is Satan):\n\n(Jesus):\n\nIf the world hates you,\n\nye know that\nit hated me\nbefore it hated you.\n\n(John 15:18).\n\n***(Hated Me): The world hated Him, so it should not be surprising that the world hates His followers.\n\n***(James 4:4)<---Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.\n\n***(1 John 2:15)<---Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\n\n***(Luke 6:26)<---Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(Build your house with Jesus, on the rock, and you will never sink, that's (IF) we continue to Keep his Commandments, we will bear MUCH FRUIT!):\n\n(Jesus):\n\nAbide in me,\nand I in you.\n\nAs the branch\ncannot bear fruit of itself,\nexcept it abide in the vine;\n\nno more can ye,\nexcept ye abide in me.\n\n(John 15:4).\n\n***For the branch to produce more fruit, it must abide, which means to dwell, to stay, to settle in, to sink deeper. The way to abide in Christ is to OBEY.\n\n***(John 15:10)<---If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.\n\n***(1 John 3:24)<---And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.\n\n***The believer who lovingly OBEYS the Word of God produces much fruit.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(Christ answers Philip, on himself and the Father as One. God manifested in the FLESH!):\n\nPhilip saith unto him, Lord,\n\nshew us the Father, \nand it sufficeth us.\n\nJesus saith unto him,\n\nHave I been so long time with you, \nand yet hast thou not known me, \nPhilip?\n\nhe that hath seen me \nhath seen the Father;\n\nand how sayest thou then, \nShew us the Father?\n\nBelievest thou not that\n\nI am in the Father, \nand the Father in me?\n\nthe words that I speak unto you \nI speak not of myself:\nbut (the Father)\nthat (dwelleth) (in me),\nhe doeth the works.\n\n(John 14:8-10).\n\n***(Revelation 21:3)<---And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the (tabernacle of God) is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and (God himself) shall be with them, and (be their God).\n\n***(Revelation 1:8)<---(Jesus)<----I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, (((the Almighty))).\n\n***The Lord rebuked Philip because he should have known the answer to the question he asked.\n\n***(He who has seen Me has seen the Father): The Lord patiently explained again that He was revealing God the Father to them in verse 7. It is impossible to escape the claim Jesus was making. Clearly, He was claiming to be God!
Well........ FUCKS! I live in Australia.  And if u go to the middle of Aus I'll see no river but desert.
That mentos ad was good.
This sounds really terrible but why would you WANT to be alive during an apocalypse? The earth would never be the same again and you can't live your life, you can't have a family, get a job or fulfil your dreams. Tbh, the lucky ones are the ones that die quickly at the start, I would rather die that way than die slowly and painfully from hunger/ radiation or any other way you could die. I'm not saying I wouldn't try to survive but I mean, it's sorta true.
When the apocalypse happens, im gonna find you first 😂😂
now make one on how to survive the adpocalypse
So, when do we get started?
All world's living animal besides humans will be eaten by humans right away. Human will eat humans, but we've got enough so those
Hands up who would need Tinder to ignite easily when Apocalypse?
Who wants to eat a rat with a burrito
Don't forget ammo, guns, and fuel
Besides me, Who actually took notes on this video 😂😂
I read that the title said How To Survive The Adpocalypse
Tip, eat other people before they eat you.
Do a video on the science behind love....like why are people so helples ..lol
I'm sorry, no. Don't eat snow or ice. It will lower your core temperature and can also cause lacerations your mouth and throat.
More like Adpocalypse. Am I rite?
The cactus and leaning shelter one are myths though.
Why would anyone want to survive an apocalypse? there's going to be nothing left to live for but suffering probably.
Just thought you guys should know that eating snow can prove to be fatal..
Nah.  I'll just put this video in my saved list and play it after the apocalypse because the INTERNET IS FOREVER!!!
So the case of an apocalypes, tribes and native cultures wouldn't even notice a change right? If they could, I believe it'd be amusing for them to say look at them. They don't know anything about surviving. Are they even human?
The worl realy needs a good hit of the reset button.
I have had the worst day today\nI hope I have a better day next week:(
I need learn some martial arts defence too!! and a knife defly!!🔪🔪🔪
SO THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED TINDER
Skinny jeans actually have the most dexterity in terms of pants/trousers. Hence why cowboys wear them as you can swing your leg over the horse’s back; something which is much harder to do in baggy or low crotch pants/jeans
During a riot avoid the rioting. In a warzone leave the area where there's fighting.
These are surviving skills for going hunting to the mountains for a month😂 surviving the apocalypse we need God 👍🏼👍🏼
Save up bottle caps and hide in a fridge and your good to go!
Dog food and baby formula.
ill just up my boi from primitivetechnology.
Is it sad the most mind-blowing thing for me I got from this video was an understanding of why the app Tinder is called Tinder.... Not that I thought about it before, but now I know...
Meh. It is easier just to die with everyone else.
previously on biiiiiiig brother
... or you can just kill yourself and avoid all the hard work lol
Or get to a city/town & head to the stores to scavenge food and equipment & possibly steal a car.
Vote justice Democrats to avoid the apocalypse. Believe me
Step one, book a holiday to California :/
Is WW 3 near than ever ?
Good thing I watched this video. I’m all set for the apocalypse now.
I was just gonna go into a Vault Tech Vault
Cacti will poison you (not fatally more like food poison) if it isn't the right
1:04 nope, screw that. I'll just jump off a cliff or something.
I am a time traveler from the year 2317. This video did not come In handy. The only way we are surviving is making slime and diss tracks.
Step 1: DON'T
Water from a cactus is actually a bad idea (can't remember why) and eating snow will decrease your body heat and can get you killed
Can’t you just... break into a store?
Who tryna survive something where everyone dies?
This was reuploaded many times.
Wow just wow
Is the thumbnail Morty?
ASAP Science?
Morty in thumbnail
Foreshadowing? 🤷🏼‍♀️
Everyone will be screwed. Millions would die. Third world countries would experience more illness (more than 1st world countries). Also, murder, stealing, and cannibalism will be more prevalent in third world countries  (more than 1st world countries). Although millions would die in the USA, I'd say we have a greater chance to create self sustaining communities. We have lots of land to farm, and guns to hunt and protect from riffraff from cities and poverty areas.  Riffraff from cities and poverty areas (designated before the apocalypse) are more likely to murder and steal within their own communities for some time, before making their way out. This time will be enough for small towns/communities to setup perimeters for defense and offense, against the riffraff. Anyone deemed to be riffraff in these towns/communities will be dealt with swiftly/harshly (maybe purged/killed). Some towns/communities will fall a part (destroy themselves), and some will survive. Over the course of 20-30 years, those that survive, will form pacts with other neighboring towns/communities, and begin trading (they will also protect each other). In 50-75 years there will be massive territories formed, and in 100 years they will unit, forming new states under one government. The USA will then be reborn, either being almost equal or worse than our current government. Then, in 150 years, we will once again become #1 in the world (yes, I am a proud American. Having pride for ones country does not make you a pos like many would have you believe. Most countries people have pride in their countries, and to say Americans can't makes that person a dumb@$$. Americans that hate their country should gtfo, instead of trying to massively overhaul everything that makes America great). Btw, as most people probably know.. this video, although slightly entertaining.. is kind of pathetic when it comes to good survival information.
We need to be Bear Grylls....just simple as that.

Glowey Chloe
I like those smokey eyes :D
What an amazing art 😍
SPOOKY
Love it 😍
Awesome 😍😍
Omg this is hot!!!
Amazing!!! Omg 😍🔥
you look soooo much like mila kunis omg
stunning!
i realky like it
so cool chloe!
Everyone does skeleton.  Boring....
HUGE thumbs up. Brilliant!!!!
PLEASE DO THAT CAT LOOK FROM LAST YEAR AGAIN!!
Amazing!!
Amazing xx
OMG I love this!!
YESSS!!!! Been waiting for these tutorials!!! xo
WOW! Great work Chloe. 👏🏻💖💀💖
yay another tutorial by chloe
Love it
Love the music!
Hahaha glam skull
super cool
👍
killed it
ur the queen! :*
Love it! So stunning!! 🎃💀😍
Would love to see this look with lashes on! I might try to recreate it!
omg this inspired me to try halloween makeup for the first time ever...wish me luck!
Cant take ure angry scull seriously, with that happy backgroundmusic. :D
loveee it
Amazing
Glowyyyy Chloe!
Wow you made this seem so easy!! 👏🏻 glowey Chloe!!
I would like to see a spooky mermaid look:)
Holy shit that's a lot of glow
you killed this look!!!
Trying this out for sure!!!!! So simple
Would the make no mistake foundation be a good base for a MAC chromocake? I'm using one for a costume, but the green color tends to stick to my skin so I need something to put under it.
I kinda loved how the dark eyeshadow made your eyes look
Love how that came out ! And it doesn't seem overly complicated. I'm really enjoying October with all the Halloween tutorials that beauty Youtubers create, a lot of them are really creative looks.
It's a bit awkward when you realize that a skeleton looks better than you do! 😂 I loved this tutorial. I've seen a lot of skulls already this year, and this is definitely one of my favourites. Nothing too over the top and I love the gloss to give it a bit of femininity. Thanks for being awesome! xOx
Beautiful chloe, and realistic for most of us to be able to achieve ♡♡ well done xxx
Do a wonder women Halloween makeup
i tried to recreate this but it looked nothing like yours :(
The best halloween tutorial for 2017 I have seen💀👑😍
Loved this look Chloe! Would love to see another one if you have time. The use of the glitter to make it look like a shiny glitter skull was perfect 👌🤗Thanks!
I forgot you were doing a halloween tutorial!! started to think jesus what is she doing hahaha
This was so easy to do and I love it! I've been really getting into Halloween looks this year and I'm definitely excited about trying this one! \n\nPlease check out my first Halloween look EVER and provide me with some feedback please! <3\nhttps://youtu.be/uPRM0a5SF1E
wow i love how simplistic you made this like something that could be in anyones makeup collection! love it
why does this video give me 2012 vibes 😂😂
'Today I'm doing something simple '\n😳 .. \nWaiting for the simple video 😏
You looked just like mila kunis when you had the dark eye make up on xx
is it just me or did this video seem rushed? :/
Your nails!😍 love ittt
Love a easy realistic Halloween look
this is one angry skull!! :D :D
Excellence to the highest power! 😗
Oh, Sam Chapman has made the same make up on Instagram
Of all the skull tutorials I've been watching, honestly this is the one I'm most likely to do haha
a lot of australians say we don't really celebrate halloween but when i was a kid (90s/00s) everyone i knew dressed up and went trick or treating. i think it varies even just suburb to suburb.
5:44 I'm just gonna do a natural highlight lol
Any other youtubers wanna support each other? Comment if you do!💕
a Halloween look I don't have to buy a whole bunch of special makeup for yesssssssssss
chloe ! the background music got me laughing really . especially that wooo oooooo
Love it!  Would love to see an Annabel look lovely.  💜💜💜
At like 3 minutes it could feasibly just be a nice smokey eye 😂
You were doing this so casually like it’s nothing but it’s seriously soooo AWESOME!! It turned out GREAT! 😍😍
For a second while you started i completely forgot this was a skull look and i was like ew Chloe whatchu doin
I love your lights, it makes your skin look real, and not overly photoshopped. Nice tutorial, Chloe :)
the glossy face really worked well with this look! i also like how you made the skull slightly messy because most skull tutorials i've seen keep everything super clean but your version is nice and edgy! it would be cool to see you do another halloween look using no special effects makeup. -Meghal
Love it! Please do a gangster clown makeup look?
You did an amazing job with look Chloe!!! Hope you make some more.
This is so awesome! Love how you did a skull that was different from the other ones out there.
So amazing!! Love it 🖤💀☠️
i love it!!.. we use this kind of skull´s for the death´s day in Mexico, we celebrate this party in 2nd of november, come to visit us!! :)
This skull is so bomb! Literally one of the most humble and down to earth youtubers 🙌🏽 Also love how your represent us Aussie’s in the YouTube industry xx
sooo beautiful! how is a skull so beautiful!
You deserve the 👍 for all the hard work and then have to wiped that out
lol the intro was so accurate halloween really isn't celebrated here at all in aus. Loved your tutorial though gurrl you are flawless
SICK LOOK!!!i loved it!!in Greece we dont really celebrate halloween either🤷🏻‍♀️
please do a corpse bride or vampire (from the vampire diaries) tutorial!! 🙌🏼🙌🏼
I love watching these.. it's so awesome what an illusion you can create!!
Wow I really think I can pull this off !!
love you Chloe!!!!!! Love your videos so much!!!!1
Love the look \nBut i wish the video was not so edited so i can see the steps 😔😔
This is great! Awesome video
You look so pretty here. Too pretty for being a skull.. lol
Love the background music!!! So cute.
I love the background music!!!
Love it!!! You should do a video removing Halloween makeup with the face halo
amazing work! so funny how you the makeup is making you look more and more angry throughout the tutorial haha
How is it possible you still look so STUNNING even with glam scary makeup?! 😩 by the way I love the look, I might try it this year! Love you! ❤️
Wow amazing tutorial😍
what u on about? a ton of children go around for Halloween tho.
You are the most beautiful skeleton I’ve seen! 🙂👍🏻
Hello world! I'm an upcoming music artist can you guys listen to my music and show support thanks.
What a great song! And that video!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This song is so fuck... brilliant! Love it!🤘🏼👌🏽
I have no idea what this song is about and why is it in my recommendation but this music is hella good. I'm so buying this album
Love Pink! Hope she will release a remix / remixes of this song. A remix with music of InXS style would be nice.
Feel like this song calls back to her earlier stuff while bringing in new elements from her newer stuff. it's got a great vibe
Can't wait for the oficial video. This is just so really fucking great 😲❤️❤️❤️❤️
Soooooo excited for you to get to Washington!  This will be fun event.
P¡nk always makes me want to go on with my life. \nBeautiful
I like pink but would it kill her to write a song that's not about being rejected or abandoned? Maybe even about rescuing someone or being rescued.
This reminds me so much of her older music <3
Pink's vocals are really powerful in the new songs i've heard from this forthcoming album. She is blowing!! LUV IT!!
My love life in a song. It's crazy how it's so timely and on point. Man.. Pink, is this u giving me an advise? 😭
I feel like this song could be in a Disney film
She never ceases to amaze me! One good song after another 💖💖💖
i dont get it why this song flop?
You can have whatever you want Pink
P!NK please come to South Africa!
Even I am not that into modern instant music, Pink always manages to surprise me in a possitive way :]
That low singing voice mmmmmmm love her
i love this song
It's been just 1 hour since I heard it and I already know almost all!
We love You, all the best for you and your family, greetings from Poland :* :* :*
YOU OUT DID YOUR SELF. I LOVED IT
that song is so perfect omg
This is true pink that keeps getting it even though how long she’s gone always keeping it real!❤️👍😁😍
I LOVE THIS SONG... if only my mum could listen to it... she loved pink and... she died when I was 6 and now I think that since she watches over my family so she will here this when I listen to it... She was a big big big fan she would’ve loved this song
I cannot get enough of this new Pink! Keep it coming! 😍
what a powerful song from powerful singer
Pink never disappoints. This song is a good example! Cheers from Brazil \o/
Come to Argentina please 👉👈
I love this Lyrics Video, does anyone know the illustrator?
.... Oh my God, this is PERFECT. It sounds sooo like the ol' good 2000 music... and the lyrics, oh my god... I'm speechless. I'm truly speechless.... ..I really really feel like this is gonna be AMAZING. ...<3

I've listen now this new song at least three times and I still don't understand it. I mean, the music with the lyrics - I don't understand. I like it, I think it's beautiful.

umm.. meh.
Thanks for never changing.
great music
Love it!
*me encanta p!nk* 👾🎶
I love her, but she should really consider changing up some of her sound just a little bit. It's starting to get a bit stale and predictable. This song sounds too similar to F***in' Perfect that its distracting.
This is a disgrace to the title of a great Cat Steven's song

Ugh I know this is irrelevant, but Kourtney is almost 40 and she still sounds like a 14 year old.
Kourtney is so much happier and glowing.
S c r i p t e d
It's weird seeing her talk to her mom it's like all Kris talks to is Kendal kylie n kim
Kris jenner needs to stop with the plastic and botox lookin like latoya jackson
I like the less makeup look on Kourt- maybe just use a different contour shade, that's the only thing I'd change
The issue is that Kourtney took Scott when he was way too young to be the kind of mature man she was hoping for, being an older woman. Their entire life have been that mismatch. And tho kids are a joy those decisions have always been sideways to what she wanted forcing him in a position to man up for her when he was not at that stage to do such  (tho he manned up for his kids). Kourtney is as much to blame for the situation she is in as is Scott. And I am on neither team and like them both as individuals. It is clear that Scott love Kourtney but unfortunately they are just on different pages of life. I do hope they find love in other people cause they would not work well unless they are very late in life. Scott needs to find himself and make mistakes without being tied to the person he made the mistakes with. I believe young ppl in their 20s should not be tied down and that is what Kourtney wanted with Scott. The age difference here came with maturity difference as well, and they both paid the price of that decision.
Is just me or does the song in the background sound a lot like Are You That Somebody by Aaliyah but slowed down?🤔
Kourtney Kardashian starts taking...aaaaaand it's the end of the world. All she tried to say was hello. she's the slowest person in talking like you literally have to speed it up to make her sound normal! I bet it's the only reason Scott can't stand her. I cringe every time she tries to speak. Like I'm shouting inside talk like a fuckin normal person
She looks a bit sleep deprived here
I am glad that Kourtney have move on with Scott. Way you go Kourtney!
Eyebrow lift and botox, she looks so different
What is the name of the music at the end?
Oh no Kortney!!! She should of left her eyebrows alone. It gives her a different unusual look. 😒
Has she had something done to her face? She look's different
She got eyebrow lift she used to have creases on her eyes.
Scott's been living off the Kardashian fame for 10 years, I agree 100% with Kourtney here. He just wants to continue living the lifestyle so he plays up for the camera's and the family
When they say hi 😏. Annoying !!
She looks like she got her face done
It is funny at least one of her kids should be real
She looks so ugly here
So glad she left Scott that relationship was horrible.
Kourt probably gave in too the plastic surgery  because she started dating a guy younger than her  ....... idk she looks different
Why Kortney has such a bad skin if she can afford anything in the world.  Looks horrible
Scott always playing the victim like sis, wyddddd
Hella VALLEY WHITE GIRL talk. Like who needs to sound like this?
Kourtney gets upset when he’s with someone else too so...
l'm over her.... She strings Scott along, it's ok for her to date though
1. You should have thought of that before you had 3 children with him.\n2. She just admitted that she doesn't want him to leave her alone. (as evident by the 3 kids)\n3. Well now you have Hookers of your own. Just a nice little instagram hook-a. (in my Lafayette voice)
Just can’t stop staring at her frozen forehead.
Kris needs to stop being her kids friends and start being their mother. Like a proper real mother. How can Kourtney say it’s ‘funny to drink so much she fell asleep in her own vomit’. That’s just not ok on any level, it’s also dangerous and not funny at all. I hope her kids NEVER see that video clip.
I was in the exact same kind of relationship, just left a week ago. All games. 10 years together
Kourtney looks older than Kris in this video....She should change her make up artist..
He is a loose cannon but when I think about him having no other family, no siblings no parents I feel sad that they don't get it back together
Kortneys cheek fillers are shifting you can see the cracks which that makeup application
With that voice alone, i'm surprised Scott hasn't lost it earlier in their relationship. Good god! Also Kourtney is often very cold to anyone around her and i remember after Scott's parents died, the way she behaved on the show. The man lost it probably because she is just not a sympathetic woman and emotionally she abandoned him when he needed her the most and Scott unconsciously cant forgive that so he is acting out like a little kid.
Face pulled up...not saggy anymore around her chin cheek area...has to keep up with the young bf😁
God whatever she's had done to her face most recently is NOT flattering.
Scott has disrespected Kourtney way to much he should not have any thing to do with her success, he is disrespectful, disgusting, baggage.
Kris said she THINKS he was jealous not he was jealous so why is kourtney  getting angry
Why do these women gaze, pause and talk?
I know that's rite kourtney
COME ON CAMERA MAN GET IT TOGETHER!!!!!!
That valley girl accent i cant
He had 10 years to put his heart in this relationship, he blew it
Kris knows exactly how social media works and to see how her kids don't listen to her advice is sad. The internet is a harsh place. Especially for a crying Kardashian
Kourtney, your new boyfriend is so hot. Scott, who?\nKourtney looks so gorgeous.
I WANT KRIS JENNER TO TEACH ME BUSINESS ASAP
Kourt's complexion looks really bad. Strange because she has access to the best dermatologist in the world.
How dare her call other girls hookers that way. She gets upset that he dates younger girls, SHE is dating a younger man. She's lead him on for years and even said on the show that having another baby with him was not totally out of the question. He's no Angel, but neither is she.
She isn't free from blame....it's just the degree falls heavily on Scott
Kourtney you are the most beautiful of your sisters, you dress better and you are mom of the year. Forget that classless waste who asks strangers for _______s when he's drunk. He can't handle a real woman that's why he is with ugly youngsters. I think Ed wrote The Shape of You thinking of you! Forget him as your love and find someone who won't humiliate you and deserves your love.
This is why I like Kourtney lol
She's finally over him, thank you God!!
I agree with Kourtney, let her have some mama time. Back off Scott she doesn't want YOU.
kourtney should stfu shes butthurt and stop wearing makeup coz she is so bad at it.
She’s right though why would she feel bad for scott? she’s living her life he needs to live his too.
What's going on with Kris Jenner' s face fillers or is it the face lift it looks odd 🤔
did u know those are not there actually houses .
what happened to her face, it looks so weird....
Like I'm so like over it like ppl like take like themselves like so srsly that's like rely not fair like
This is the most I’ve heard her talk without stoping after every single word
The biggest load of bollox on TV. plastic fuckin assholes who will never grow old gracefully. I would not mind if any of them were good looking or had a personality. big headed morons
Has Kourt had botox...?
Kourtneys real face/age at 0:57
Poor baby
Q fea mujer
kourtney looks krae krae
Whao
I LOVE SCOTT 😫😭😒
Kourtney got something done that fucked up hwr face
!!!!
Kourtney looking older than kris 😕
Girl.... fix your eyebrows
Bella Thorne is shaking....
Lazstyftrrthicl
Something odd about kourtneys face...
Kourtney needs to ditch the Don Draper Dickhead
Drag comparison example close faith advocate taste moment forty
The way they say Hi Hiiiiiii ugh lol
Such great actors lmao

Very icy scripted 📜

Kris slaying that adidas
I liked kourtney’s old brows
Ew I just realized how ugly kourtney tbhhh
kourt has old lady neck :(
Go kourtney
Kourtney looks just like her mother
Kris's shoe laces are untied
Kourtney, isn't innocent, F that short heifer!
Kourt is so pretty!
Omg monotonic voice is beyond annoying
They tell Scott to get a life and he goes and tries to find someone else and they hate him for that. Kourtney is dumb
That’s the most emotion I have ever seen from her.
Now that Scott is where she always wanted him to be and she's over him. That's so sad. I wish they'd fall in love again.  Kids love seeing thier parents together
I hope Scott leaves Kourtney for good, she is very controlling
Kourt called Sophia Richie, Bella Thorne and all the other girls he's been photographed with, hookers lmaoo🤣🤣🤣
Wait wait wait whaaaaaaa so at the beginning the mean girl says she hates diy stuff and she likes mylifeisEva and you do diy sometimes
If you come with me you'll float too 🎈🎈🎈
Am i the only army (bts fan) who heard DNA
OMG SHE USED DNA!!!! Where the ARMYs at??!!!
I'm being an angel with my fav dress, and my fav halloween candy is full sized snicker bars
I loved Bandit and friendly Alien. <3
I CHOKED ON MY WATER WHEN I HEARED DNA
That cute Alien hair was just like Ariana Grande's hair in her latest instagram post!!!
Lmao Eva knows how to bring in the kpop audience
M here bc of her intro (DNA)
Did she really put bts dna in the intro
Bts dna music in the intro 💚
With the contacts you look like Maddie zeigler xx
Awesome video 💕 cute costumes and your editing is amazing !

I totally loved the idea of the bae watch😂\nAnd did anyone from the BTS army hear what I did?💞
umm, Eva. I was eating when DNA came on.... AND I CHOKED. THIS VIDEO IS A SAFETY HAZARD.
That's so ghetto\nI think you mean ghetto fabulous
these no effort outfits are really cool Eva!! How do you do it??
I LOVE THE FACT THAT ALL THE COMMENTS ARE ABOUT BTS LIKE AMAZING VIDEO KEEP ADDING MORE KPOP AND YOUR GOING TO SEE THAT YOUR CHANNEL WILL GROW EVEN MORE NO JOKES KPOP FANS ARE CRAZY
DID I HEAR DNA IN THE INTRO AW YEAHHHH
This is by far my favorite  hairstyle  of yours. Love the hair color
DA FOQ IS THAT DNA I HEAR
6:53 What song is that?
Her tan is goals!😍
Okay so I get that people are annoyed with all the comments about BTS's DNA being in the intro, but I myself, am apart of the ARMY and with all the comments about BTS being 'annoying' or 'shitty' why don't you keep those opinions to yourselves because no one wants to hear them. Just watch the video and ignore the comments unless you are going to say something that is actually useful towards Eva or the ARMY. Okay? I apologize for ranting but if you are going to insult someone, keep it to yourself. Thanks.
Btw I love Eva and her videos don't fite me.
does anyone know where she got her jaws shirt?
Why does she look like Sookie from True Blood when she's dressed as the cute farmer lmaooo
Ok so.. Eva , you should be Georgie (in my opinion) but guys please stop talking about DNA (btw I'm an ARMY) but it's really annoying! Sorry but you aren't watching any BTS MV's or bombs (anything BTW related )
This isn’t a popular opinion it candy corn is the bestttt
Hears DNA start playing goes to the comments...OMG DNA ARMY!!! ect 😂 no one can hide from army and this is what happens when we find something bts related 😂
Alien and vs angel were dope af
okay we get it- BTS. Van we focus on the fact maybe only half the watching audience has any of this clothing. Lss- go to the store and get half the props
GIRL I SEE YOU WITH THAT DNA BEAT AS YOUR BACKGROUND MUSIC BTS IS MY LIFE
OMG THE KILLERS I LOVE THAT BAND!!!
I don't no about the cute farmer
My mom took me this go see IT and I'm just turned a preteen on the eclipse and I screamed!!! I am HORRIFIED of CLOWNS I HATE them
This girl isn’t funny and this video was wack lmao

Make a DIY Halloween costumes for man video with Adam.
What I love about Eva's Halloween  costume ideas is that he costumes r realistic, I mean like being a CHILL PILL for halloween is unrealistic (no offense laurdiy) but you've got to agree with me right?

everyone’s here for the DNA intro but honestly these costumes SLAY MY EXISTANCE
ahh i miss these havent seen one in a while
I like games and even I think this is some what funny, I don't take this seriously.
Everyone complaining about microtransactions are idiots. It's not p2p, you can play the game and unlock everything. If you hate them so much just don't buy them
dang they should bring back the rating system.
6:45 The head on a pike part sounded good isn't that better than none of it being good
you know when you are around gamers and competent people with decent reaction speed and reflexes \n\n\nyou really get a sense of how jarring and odd it is for people to be so bad at reacting to things and just sitting there clueless going wtf \n\nits weird now seeing the normies
Wait is he actually in the game?
When Orc Kumail got his torso cut off, oil came out. That's racist.
I wanna play shadow of war so bad
Didn't Kumail play as Primo from that Adventure time show on Cartoon Network?
SIGN UP --> ENTER CODES --> GET PAYED!!\nI made $150 just last night XD\nTrying to get referrals! Help me help you! Thank You!\nhttp://pepiredrsa.win/3522403659458/
Can you play star wars battlefront 2
God damn Conan is such an ass, how do people stand him?
holy crap the lip syncing is so bad please tell me this is just a beta build
this is fake. how can you play the game when it doesn't come out until 3 days from now in the future
He looks like paddock\n\n\n\nThe vegas shooter
Who else can wait until shadow of war gets released?
Awesome game and you guys are real funny
I don't understand their intent on these gaming videos. They are advertising the game, but the host, Conan, just slams every game and the idea of a gamer every time.
What an awful voice for a character in this game.
Ok so I totally thought when we saw the agonizer trailer with Kumail, we were just hearing his lines without or filters.....but I'm baffled to why they didnt change it XD
Loves his family, but doesn't know how to show it, so covers it with alcohol 😂
I wonder how much it cost WB for that marketing stunt...
You're WAIST-ing my time I'M DEAAADDD
... yes. every shade of your mom's lipstick.\n\n\n\n\n\n... and her butthole
Is kumail Nanjiani multiple colors?\n\nYes, every shade of your moms lip stick... and her butthole
Erin needs to stop being a little bitch
Can't wait to play this game
He has a unique voice, which is good but the way its been used in games so far is bad. It was wierd hearing him as a salarian since they had a distinct type of voice previously and now the orc which doesnt fit his voice at all.
I flagged this video for not advertiser friendly because this game is too volient.
*It's violent games like this that causes so much division leading to mass shootings. My 23 year old grandson plays Grand Theft Auto 5 that when I visited him at UCLA I was ashamed and distraught.*
How can i voice act for video games!?
I miss his rating system
Please do a VR surgery simulator next.
i wanna see conan play the next batman game with ben affleck!!! who agrees?
And they think I dont know about games haha! 😂 😂
Pool camp Christmas pitcher stick residential database change.
Conan's contour and highlight is on point

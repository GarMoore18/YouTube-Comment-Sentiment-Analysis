Notice this act did not come before her Wonder Woman movie. This is because they needed to have her idolized by young girls. Then they make their move with their agenda. Mothers and Fathers protect your sons and daughters. Do not support Gal Gadot or this flagrant propaganda against your children.
This isn’t crazy....THIS IS LESBOS!- Mr’s garrison.
YES!!!!!! I CAN NOW REST IN PEACE.
For the first time in my life I feel envy.

You know that Kate was so fucking turned on

Gal gadot is the only person ive EVER seen in snl just blatantly stare at the teleprompter....i mean shit atleast TRY to make it subtle
... I felt something watching... Just saying.
As a male this did not give me a boner but My room did get hot. Perfectly normal
Is it everyone or do we have a couple of hours. A half hour relationship lesbian relationships can be brief.
#GalGadot is too #hot 2 b #true, but she's so #fine, I wanna make her #mine! ;) <3 .. I feel #stronger now after watchin her #kiss like an #amazon! ...#sweet!
Isn't  that Wonder woman?
Holy lord, anyone can see that was a kiss anyone would like... yaozzzaaaa.... what a sight
The Lord of the Flies gender swap leaked footage
Why did they bleep out ‘tits’? It wasn’t bleeped out on the original show.
This was painful to watch. 🙄Didn't find it funny. Anyone else think that Gal looked uncomfortable doing this skit? \nI miss Kristin Wigg & her small hands skits.
Not gonna lie, I got a little chub.
Did I just watch a female Matt Damon?
I'm a lez!!
Best day of Kate's life, no doubt.
they aired THIS and cut the last fry song? are you kidding me?
Did you guys find that they said their name wrong?  They all claim herself Megan, the other is Dre.
That kiss was hot 🔥🔥🔥
Gal Gadot! So hott
I hate American humour
Kate da man!
Sexism at its best, you couldnt do this with 2 cis males hitting on the Amazonians.
I honestly couldnt decide wich woman I was more jealous of, Kate or Gal.
You know what else is evil? Ads that you can't skip.
A kiss to get ratings. sad
That one lady reminds me of a female version of Chris Farley. What a stupid loss that was... You will be missed, Chris!
Damn that just wasn't fair watching Gal with Kate!! Lol
Anyone else noticed one of them got the names mixed up when they said Megan and Dre? lol @1:21 @1:32
Women are not funny
Wait a second the word tits isn’t allowed?
that was hot
MADtv
showing how dikes sexualized everything ...finally snl you got something right....bravo bravo
WONDER WOMAN IS BISEXUAL THOUGH
Please help me what was that I found in my last video I'm
Everyone saying Kate's so lucky! No (I mean yes) but Gal is so lucky! I mean it's Kate Freaking McKinnon
I relate to Kate on a spiritual level here..
SNL sucks now
Double thumbs down and goodbye me watching Wonder Woman or Justice League.
Is Gal really that tall?  Or is Kate really, really short?
Exactly, normal people don’t want any mentally ill faggots looking at the knowing the sick bastards would fuck you if they had the chance 🖕🏻🖕🏻
Women trying to be funny is not funny
Pathetic.
This was funny
This was hilarious!
wooooooooooooooooooooooooow
promise industrial similarly me frozen necessary abandon.
holy shit gal gadot looks like a phenominal kisser omfg
If Diana ain't a bit gay, how does she kiss so well? 🤔🤔
We need more of this breaking down heteronormativity
LMFAO conservatives rubbing their man junk all over the place 24/7 and their porn and sexual desires and preach not being offended but this is gross LOLOLLLLLLLLLLLLL
fucking gross out right now

Damn
Harvey Weinstein
Really? Ridiculous
Man, Gal Gadot just tasted fish.

*WE NEED ANOTHER DYKE AND FATS SKETCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*
Okay, so in order for women to be strong and independent they need to be more like men. Got it. Message received!
Need 2 shit on trump more.
stupid fn show.\nMAKE AMERICA & TV \nGREAT AGAIN!!!
Gal gadot is not hot at all
Why is it when a lesbian or gay guy goes into a strait bar or gathering they thing they are going to hook up???? and just block anyone who say's hey i'm strait...
Even when Kate is dressed like a lez, she is still hot.
I'm old enough to remember when SNL was funny.
fucking sjw shit being forced down my fucking throat maaan i miss the old SNL the fuck was the purpose of the kiss anyway??
Next year the legend is Theo Heiny
Hugh was seriously a let down
Good game lads...Robbie savage is sooo entertaining to watch, gotta love him. Best quote of the day regarding one of the keepers, he should be playing for Donald Trump coz he's a wall.   LOL
Who else remember the first ever Wembley cup😂😂😂😂
Why didn't Joe Waller play? Is he hurt too?
Weller didn't even play... Why did he take his top off?
steven gerrard says next year??? mate this is not liverpool chasing the premier league lol
If billy wingrove played earlier he would have knocked in at least 4
tekkers biggest mistake: having Gerrard on the team. they just put bad luck on themselves
kieran brown really bad on the pitch should stay with his tricks and freestyle
I mean gerrard
Crawford sucks
The commentators just hate each other don’t they 😂😂😂
I think they should host one of the games here in Houston Texas
Stuart Pearce losing a game as a manager? Where have we seen this before...
What's the song called  when the commentary said that ksi intressed
Tekkers was so op but still got destroyed
If billy was on for Cutting, Tekkers prolly could have won or tied
Hope ksi don't make a disstrac about tekkers city
This is unfair: you take a team that has already play a lot of games togheter and that is really fit and then a team that has never played togheter and are really unfit and then play against each other. of course the fit team is going to win and if you think that legends will help then no ok some of them were fit still but many of them were not so the legends will also not really help. Plus you obviously need a professional coach and do some training because everyone got tackled who ever got the ball and when some one was open no one else opened up so it was very hard to pass it is just un fair it is the same as real madrid and tekkers town played togheter un fair also the others from hashtag who were off camera during the challenges were obviously training togheter
Why does lynch never use his skill
Hashtag only won because billy was injured
Gerrard is the man of the match
Hashtag united sucks
If billy was playing they would have won
Heskey time
commentary was on another level! hope you guys do it also next year! thanks for the laughs! oh, and the game was ok too
Anyone can tell me the score so I don’t have to watch the whole thing
chrismd :/
Hi everyone can you check out my little boys football channel if you like subscribe thank you
Did joe Weller come on?
Gerrard never nasty...just stamped on Herrera that one time after being on the pitch for 1 min ;)
does anybody else get annoyed by geordie sometimes? something about him idek.
David James just isn't a legend, always been shot and still is now hahaha
Crappy defensive side for tekkers. Absolutely no chemistry and fitness for tekkers. This isn’t right 😡😡😡
why cant the amazing freestylers like daniel cutting and sian garnier and jezza just dribble through the whole team and score like they do in their videos
+F2Freestylers - Ultimate Soccer so funny when there was a pen for jezza and he was so serious when he scored but then he was like, this is just my job
Please do a Highlights video like last year.
How much did Spencer pay the F2???
david JAMES as they call him in spain lmao lawrence u dumbass lol haha funny mfkrs
Just finished highschool but already makes more money then you
If tekkers town had a single legend in defence this game would've been very different.
Geordie looking smart once a year for the wembley cup. 😊
without a doubt the commentary made this
Came and stayed for the commentary
I think Elliot let Team Tekkers down the whole game.
I went to the Match
As much as I'd like it to be true, William Gallas never won a World Cup.
country music these days is awful , I enjoy Billy currington  ,but I don't care about the others. our 1990s n 1980s music will not be played again unless there's a station that just plays the older music . it's too bad too, it took away a lot of good music!!!! if we have CDs of our favorites, then we can listen to them . but I think there should be a good amount of the older country played. the 1980s& 1990s really had a lot of good country. music worth listening to.!!.
Yo, I haven't exactly payed the attention i should've. Can anyone tell me why Billy ain't playing?
KSI and Joe Weller on the same team lol.
Don't know who I would prefer as a defence out of Liverpool's defence or tekkerz town's defence
is scott allowed to have that bottle......
They should make a tournament  with teams Facebook youtube twitter and istagarm
Geordie and Laurence's commentary was golden, had me laughing all game.
Seb is such a try hard haha and it doesn’t work.
Brain and Lawrence managed to make this game incredibly entertaining 😂
Well done to billy wingrove for coming on
My Bad 14.34
Yes hashtag
There both Sunday leeeeagueee
Houst, Tx
It is boring when spencer fc/hashtag united always win like if you agree😊😊😊
Spencer FC
Man True Geordie and Lawrence are to much!!😂😂😂
I miss this!!!! Noo
Hashtag should sign jeremy lynch and billy wingrove
Wingrove?
Theo Barker hahehe lol
Anyone know the song that was played when they scored
What's the goal song called?
Who saw Jimmy Conrad pointing where jeremy was going when he was taking the penalty
I love spencer fc like if you agree
I focking love how k.s.i is in the same team as husky long time fans will get it hilarious.
Linesman should go in the kitchen and make me a meal

This series is so pointless to watch we know Spencer’s gonna win at least make the match interesting by going into penalties or something
The commentator who you talking about when referring to KSI... omg!!! Had me crying!!! You can tell he is old and doesn't follow today's celebrity's. 😂😂😂😂😂
This video is wonderful, thanks Simon. My mental health is bit of a dumpster fire at the moment and all these world mental health day discussions are catching me off guard, but I think are exactly what I need, if that makes sense. Midwinter was a book that destroyed me, and I didn't even have the personal connection you did - there's just something so vulnerable and beautiful about a book that expresses sadness that well. I read my favorite book (The Mill on the Floss) when I was going through a rough patch, and it just articulated things inside me that I'd never thought were important enough to be captured on paper. Anyway, going off on my own tangents now, thanks again for your thoughts
From a person who suffers with mental health issues I send you much love Simon. Thank you. 💚
Great video Simon and thank you for sharing your mental health story with us. I absolutely agree that books can help with some mental health symptoms/ situations. I suffer from anxiety and depression, with some periods of my life the depression was more intense and others the anxiety was more intense. I still get anxious about work related things or personal relationship where I feel that I didn't do something right or good enough and will go over it in my head. I have learned that I need to debrief at the end of the day by having time to escape into a book and have a cup of tea. This helps me to get away for a bit and not dwell on things that can be irrational. I think this was a helpful video and was great to hear how books assisted you through some of your mental health situations.
Simon thank you so much for this video and your honesty in it. Books have definitely helped my mental health in terms of self help books building up my self esteem and resilience, but also like you say getting lost in fiction. The times when my physical health has been really bad I don't know what I would have done without books - I so needed that escape. Thanks again for this video xx
Fantastic video!  Thank you for sharing.
Thanks for this Simon, it's always reassuring to hear other people talk about going through the same/similar things as I have. Books are definitely a solace. When I feel in need of comfort I read Nancy Drew mysteries as they take me back to childhood!
Thank you for making this video! Reading and books have always been there for me when my depression is bad.
I think this was a good video. It is a personal thing indeed but I think that readers, or rather big readers are often people who have experienced mental health issues and have found solace in books. In 2005, there was a summer I would come home every day from work, go to bed curl up with a Jane Austen, I read all her books a couple of times that summer and Persuasion I read more than 10 times that August. I was in a very bad place and somehow Austen just got it. And then slowly I got better.
This video and your honesty with us was exactly what I needed right now, Simon! Thank you very much!
Thank you so so so much for posting this Simon! As someone who has suffered from depression and anxiety in the past I think its so important to us all to talk about it and know we are not alone. I think books of all kinds can not only be therapeutic for us when we are going through a difficult time mentally but also physically. I know myself when my physical health has been bad it then has had a knock on effect on my mental health-reading has helped me escape for a while when physically the only choice ive had is to rest, read and escape! :)  Thanks again -you're a gem! or a gem of a bear you might say! :) xoxx
Reading can make you escape in the darkest of times. I feel that's what's informed my reading from a young age and what let me find fantasy novels as an escape from reality since a young age. Thanks for making this video and opening up a discussion!
Ahh I love the video!
Thank you for sharing, Simon! As someone who is suffering a great deal from a debilitating  mix of depression, anxiety  and stress, I felt a lot better just to listen to another person who has been through it before. It made me feel less lonely and really hopeful about overcoming it all.
Thank you so much, Simon! It is really helps.\nI've just started to take meds for depression last week, finally gave in =D. Mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, also fear of death, etc. have been with me from teen years, more than a decade already, and well, it is hard. At the moment I'm winning, because I've learnt how calm myself, even without meds (internal dialogue). Movies, TV shows and sleep are my other treatment. Unfortinately, I have this problem when I can't really concentrate if I feel sad or am caught in a loop of depressive thoughts, so I can't read. Hope that this tendency will pass with time.\nLots of love to you. Stay strong!
This was a wonderful video, Simon.  Thanks for your honesty in sharing your mental health experiences.  I often have suffered from hormonal depression, but never to the extent that is was an issue for me.  \nReading has been a lifeline for me when I have been through some pretty horrible experiences.  I don't have too many memories of before I was 11 when my parents split up.  Reading was my saviour then.  I was sexually abused for about 5 years in my early teen years, and later on my stepfather was a horribly abusive alcoholic.  Throughout all those years reading was my safe place - and it continues to the place where I feel least threatened by the world, where I feel the safest, where I feel I belong and where I don't have to do anything or be anyone but myself.  \nNowadays my own life is a lot less harrowing but my 31 year old son suffers from schizophrenia and my daughter has been diagnosed with clinical depression as well as fibromyalgia so mental health is very close and all around me.\nYou and I have vastly different tastes in reading - I am a popular fiction reader through and through, but your channel is such a welcome relief from all the noise noise noise that goes on in this world.  You are a lovely man and I always look forward to your name popping up in my subscription feed.  Thank you for your content and I wish you nothing but wellness and happiness.  Love from NZ
Lovely video Simon; I appreciate your honesty about mental health.  I needed this, as I am a bit shaky in the mental health department right now. I would like to hear your review of A Line Made by Walking.
Simon, thank you so much for this video! I've been going through a bad patch lately, and have been for pretty much this whole year, but I've found myself reading a ton lately and it has helped me so much. Books really can act as an escape and a way to not have to think about what's going on around you for a bit. I've truly found that books have helped me tons over the years I've been an avid reader.
Thanks so much for creating and sharing this video. I was completed sucked in, and enjoyed the bits you would have edited out - love seeing that stuff. On the topic of dealing with grief, have you read H is for Hawk? I own a copy, but haven't read it yet, but it generally comes up a lot on the topic of grief and processing change, etc. and comes highly recommended from the BookRiot gang. Anyway, I really appreciate this video, and generally, your videos are always a bright spot in my day no matter how things are going. Thank you!
Thank you so much for making this video and being so open. I work as a mental health therapist and I’m often talking to people about what they are reading and how it helps. It is definitely something people struggle with more than we know. I truly believe every time someone shares their story they make someone else feel more “normal”. Thank you for being brave.
So needed, great video.
This video is wonderful, I've been feeling down lately and your videos always cheer me up. It's wonderful to see more people talking about mental health.
Was having a terrible day today (just woke up like that) and this was great to see. Didn't even know i needed it until I clicked. Thanks x
I don't have a lot to contribute to the conversation, but I really loved this video.
Suffering from mood swings since going through menopause, I know exactly what you mean and you're right, reading helps!! Watching book tube videos helps. But I have phases when I can't read depressing stories or very suspenseful stories but there are a lot of other books I can read instead! Thank you for be so honest about your problems.
Thanks for sharing, I send you lots of love and hugs simon. xxxx
I wish I could 'love' this video. *massive virtual squeeze*
You are wonderful and life affirming and a joy! Thank you for all your vlogs but especially this one.  You said so much that i am going to ponder over. A couple of things about reading helping mental health in my experience: depression is exhausting and especially talking to people during depression is just too much effort. I crave silence at that time but as yiu say that can cut you off. But you can read, think, and in a way interact while being silent when yiu read. Also reading is like exercise or maintenance for the emotions and mind on a daily basis. We develop and hone our responses and capacity for imagination and empathy while we read and that pays off in hard times.
I recognized what I interpret as nerves near the end about sharing this, and I just wanted to say that I am glad you did.
That is such a touching story (I'm at the story of 10 year old Simon) and I'm sending you good thoughts.
Can I give this video like milion thumbs up...?
Wow, great video Simon. I loved reading A Line Made by Walking and Midwinter too and it's so moving hearing how you connected with them personally.
Thank you Simon for this video. I suppose it was really hard to talk about it, for that reason I even more appreciate you shared your experiences with us. Sure it will provide help/support to others. Thank you again :)\n\nPS. You are absolutely right, your channel  does bring happy moments :)))) (plus some serious added value as well)
A wonderful video thank you! I appreciate all you've done and said. Sending you love
Powerful. This is a video I shall return to again and again. ❤️
Thank you so much for your brave video. Really honest, vulnerable and important! Wanted to give you a big hug at the end :)
I am really glad you decided to upload this video. We do share some similar experiences, especially regarding grief, so, as you said, it‘s so helpful to know you‘re not alone.
This was a truly lovely video Simon. Thanks for sharing. Reading is generally speaking a source of stress relief for me, but as you said it can also be a balm in terms of finding others (whether fictional or not) that have had shared experiences. I have gone through one or two periods of intense anxiety and that actually makes it really hard to focus on reading. I've found that audio books are actually better when you have too much nervous energy so that you can take walks or run or whatnot and at the same time listen to a story. Stories can really help draw the mind away from negative loops and focus on something else.
Thanks so much for doing this video and for being so open. I can relate to what you were saying about reading being helpful for your mental health and comforting you through tough times. although it's only this year that I have returned to reading & found book tube and it has a been a real comfort and life saver for me. I have read 80 books since May when I started reading again and I can't believe that I stopped reading for 7 years!!! Thanks again for sharing 😍
Thank you so much for this video!! I live with a mental health condition and at its worst it makes me very socially isolated (nature of the beast innit?) but books have always kept me feeling connected to the world, at least in some small way and have proved invaluable. I've always loved the Jeanette Winterson quote Art is an air pocket in an upturned boat,  that's what books have been for me. Also - sometimes if I struggle to engage with the world and have to retreat for a while, when I start to feel ready to re-connect I find spending some time knitting (other crafty pursuits are available! ;) and watching a backlog of booktube videos enormously therapeutic. It allows me that 'halfway house' of feeling like I'm hanging out with lovely people while not having the immediate pressures that socialising entails. So, yes, thanks, loved your unedited honesty - wonderful video!
Thanks Simon you probably just helped a lot of people.
This is great. I have a mental health blog and agree, although I am not a doctor, just sharing what works for me does help people so thank you. And thank you for talking about MH too! I would love a goldsmiths video and or a line made by walking video. All of the videos. ALSO. Can you tell us when the dates for the costa are? Like longlist and shortlist and announcements? I can't find it anywhere but I might just be being silly. Xxx
Thanks so much Simon, I found that really helpful. I started reading again because of grief, my daughter died. I found comfort and understanding in books. It helped me comprehend what my family and I was going through. I still look out for good grief stories.
This is wonderful. I needed this video right now.  Thank you thank you thank you.
Fantastic video. I've also had issues in the past, and often still struggle with anxiety, it's great to hear people speaking openly about these things. I also think books definitely help. I'm a bit of an introvert (like a lot of bookish people I suppose) and have a tendency to isolate myself. I went to a talk last night and Ali Smith mentioned isolation and reading, how you can feel alone and go and sit by yourself in a room, but as soon as you open a book that room fills with people.
Thank you for sharing your own experiences Simon .Reading helps me escape. 👍sleeping helps too. XXX
There was one book I picked up after my brother died that helped me a lot.  The best part of this book was being told to acknowledge your feelings and allow them to be...for a bit.  It was also good to have an activity to do, something that made me feel like I was doing something to dig out of my pit because the book actually has tasks to work through.   I still grieve for him 12 years later but it doesn't take me into the pit of hell when it comes over me now.  The Grief Recovery Handbook  by  John W. James, Russell Friedman
This is one of my favourite videos of yours. Thank you for addressing this difficult topic that's also been/is very present in my life, and for being so vulnerable and honest! I'm going to try and get my hands on a copy of A Line Made By Walking asap. Thanks for doing so much good, Simon! x
Great video! And what an important topic!\n\nMy first major downward spiral was about 12 yrs ago. I had just discovered Audible and, wanting the biggest bang for my buck, I searched for the longest books with the best ratings. I stumbled onto Outlander by Diana Gabaldon and was instantly captivated by Davina Porter's narration and the main character of Claire. Davina's Claire became my best friend. She was smart and tough and I just fell into her story. Reading was definitely an escape from terrible things going on in my real life but also gave me a reason to hang in there through each day so I could listen to the next chapter at bedtime. That book is 40+ hours long so it lasted many many days. And there are a ton of sequels. I'm not exaggerating when I say that Claire saved my life. Eventually I made my way to therapy and a good doctor. But I'd never have made it that far if it weren't for that book that just hooked me. I hope everyone who struggles with depression finds a book, or many books, to fall into one day at a time.\n\nOn a side note, you are looking particularly handsome today Simon! (Swear I'm not a stalker. Just speaking the truth 😊)
Brave video Simon, and beautifully delivered.  I also like to be alone, but not lonely, and given my physical isolation, I feel like my Booktube family are my most important and easiest to access portal to a social life with like-minded people.  I'm in a beautiful place and mostly thrive on the isolation, but some days I'm so glad when you pop in for a chat.  You are funny and wise and self-deprecating, such good qualities in an imaginary friend.\n\nOddly enough, I've just begun reading a short story in bed at night before going to sleep and it helps enormously.  I'm currently reading 'The Day I Ate Whatever I Wanted'  by Elizabeth Berg and it's very good.\n\nIncidentally, I've also just finished Tin Man (recommended by you and others).  Absolute heartbreaker and I loved it.  Thanks for the chat.
Wonderful video, Simon. Hugs and more hugs.
You are such a good egg Simon, you really are. Talking about mental health needs to be continually kept relevant. I can't even talk about the things which have effected my mental health in the past ... you are very brave xx
Thank you so much Simon. This was a wonderful video! I truly appreciate your openness. My aunt introduced me to Will Schwalbe's beautiful book.  I've also read his more recent work, Books for Living.  He is a wonderful bookish companion. I cannot imagine a life without books. I find such solace in reading. Thank you again for sharing your own experience.
amen....to all the here's to's that you mentioned..and here's to sharing as best we can and here's to you simon for your generosity in creating this video.
Best video yet! Thank you for sharing your very personal story. I can relate. I’ve had anxiety for a long time and my depression spurts come and go as well. I agree that books can be a form of escapism. Reading them as well as just wandering around bookshops works for me. I also have a rather large dvd collection if I need a quick escape fix. I also think is true that every once in a while we find a book that speaks to us and leaves us all a little less lonely. All my best to you!
It is an amazing gift you've given us by sharing your journey - calmly, kindly, warmly. With regards to the grief, A Year of Magical Thinking, by Joan Didion, made me realize I wasn't alone.
Thanks for such a wonderful video Simon! Mental health is exactly what you said, something that we need not be afraid to talk about! I'm so glad to hear that you liked A Line Made by Walking. I was recently able to pick it up for only a few dollars as an ebook. I'm really looking forward to getting to it!
I don't even know where to start with this comment - I have been binge watching BookTube today and thinking about starting my own and I come across your channel at 1:30am - firstly it's lovely to find a fellow Brit, secondly, it's lovely to see someone my age and thirdly, I think you are basically the male version of me!  (I should state I love ALL BookTubers, but meeting a Brit the same age as me has given me renewed hope that I can indeed give this a go!\n\nI smiled, I LOL'd and I teared up watching this.  I haven't ben through anything like what you have but so much of your journey sounds like mine - I loved it when you said I don't like feeling lonely but I quite like being alone. this is something I have struggled to get other people to understand so it is refreshing to hear someone else say it.  And I totally, TOTALLY have the paranoia thing too, in fact it's what caused me to lose a job 18 months ago .. well that an the panic attacks I was having almost daily (mostly due to the paranoia and anxiety I experienced in my role and at the place I worked,\n\nThank you so much for opening up so honestly and eloquently (tangents are fun). I shall stop here otherwise .. well it's nearly 2am now and I really should get to bed ..!\n\nPS - you have a new stalker ;)
Thank you for this heartfelt video. When my sin died I spent a lot of time with Jane Austen. I know those characters/people so well and they never let me down. I didn't want any surprises or mysteries just good writing and friends (well, Elizabeth Bennet is my friend!). Thanks again.
Excellent video, Simon. I'm sure that wasn't easy to share such personal moments but thank you for sharing your story with us. I think so many of us have suffered at one time in our lives with mental health, but it's so great to see so many people opening up about their struggles and breaking the stigma against mental illness. I can't think of any books in particular that have helped me through a particularly rough patch, but I definitely turn to books (and booktube!) as a source of comfort or distraction when life gets hard.
Thank you for sharing. I think we put so much emphasis on being yourself and uniqueness in general that we forget how important and comforting it is to be reminded that, in the end, we're actually not so unique. I am not the only person in the world experiencing a problem. Someone else has been there. You are not alone. Someone else has felt that. Etc.
Thank you for sharing this video it really helped. I suffer with mental health and it's nice to hear that I'm not alone in how I'm feeling
thanks for sharing your experiences, Simon. I think videos like this always, always help! glad you decided to make it :)
Thank you for sharing! I think it’s hard to share something so personal. I have suffered with depression and anxiety for years. It’s been fine for awhile, but I lost my dad in December last year which triggered my depression. I have struggled all year. The reason I’ve said this is because I’ve tried to read for escape, but it is just not working for me. I’ve been in the biggest slumpiest slump of my life since he got sick in November of last year. I’ve read 30 books. I’ve probably started and put down 100. It’s just so frustrating because I want to read, but I just can’t. I’m hoping to pull out of it soon because I agree with you that it is good for depression.
Thanks for such a personal video Simon, it's actually really refreshing. I've never really thought of reading and how it relates or influences my mental health before, but I now realise that I am someone who, when lonely or depressed, either obsessively reads or gets in the biggest slump ever. There is no in between. \nThe specific books I read also tend to influence my mental health, as some books really give me a real 'high' (mostly because they're just really good books), whilst others really depress me. And I don't even always know specifically why a book has had a negative influence on my mental health, so that's a bit annoying.\nI can see how this video (and others) may feel like therapy, as just reflecting on such things in my mind sort of felt like therapy, haha.\nI'm really intrigued by A Line Made by Walking, but I feel like I may relate to it more if I read it in a couple of years, so I'm in doubt whether or not to buy it..
I have the same issue. Some days are wonderful and my excitement is off the charts and others days its like the world is upside down. I know you were hesistant to do this video but I appreciated hearing someone say they have the same issues I do. Makes ya feel not so alone.
Thank you so much for sharing this video. It's really helpful to hear about others' experiences and how different people get through the difficult moments in life, however long they last. Big hugs from me and my cat!
Yes Simon, I feel the same way as you.  I like being alone alot but I do not feel lonely when I’m reading because “books are my friends”.  Totally agree.  Thanks for sharing!
It's been really helpful to watch this semi-cuppa and a catch up/ reminisce with you Simon.
I suffer regularly with depression manifesting in self doubt, paranoia and manic spending.  Events over the last 2 years makes it hard for me to feel people truly like me for who I am or will hurt or leave me.  Recent health issues mean that more than ever my hobbies root me to reality and for this it is reading and art journalling.  I started Youtube last year and have done some book buddy reads and chatted with some lovely people.  I am so pleased you felt comfortable enough to be so open about something so personal xx
Thanks for this video. I work from home, which a lot of people think is the dream, and it is a really lonely 😔 I miss out on socialising out of office hours because I have fibromyalgia which makes it hard to sit in a hard chair for a long time and I need my rest. Your videos really help me feel less lonely. I do worry it’s a bit sad that I feel I know you but it always cheers me up to see a new video from you no matter the topic... well I would draw the line at Simon goes hunting or something 😂 I’m currently reading it’s all in your head. A guide to getting your shit together by Rae Earl at the moment which I think is meant for a slightly younger audience than me (I’m 40) but nonetheless is a good book on different facets of mental health and where to go or what to do to help yourself. Anyway thanks for the videos xx
Brilliant video - thanks for sharing :)
Brilliant, Simon.  Thank you.
Thank you, Simon. <3 <3
I completely agree that everything is spectrums, and that we should be open about our experiences when it is safe to do so.  Thanks for sharing, Simon.
My parents died in my 30s and i wasnt. ready.  I dont think anyone really is.  It wasnt books that got me though it was my Dads records the swing of Goodman and the jaxz of Coltrane and Miles. I wish i had Grief is a thing with feathers back then.
Thanks for this video Simon, and sorry to hear about the difficult times you’ve been through. I can definitely say that your videos - and those of some other lovely book tubers - have helped me an awful lot during some low times, so thank you! Also, books themselves have helped me to escape, take my mind off things and have sometimes reminded me that there are other people out there who have felt the same things as me, and have put it much more eloquently than I ever could. That’s the reason ’A Line made by Walking’ is one of my favourite books of the year too. That and the beautiful writing.

The song is so damn good I at the showing tonight and it was amazing!!!!!!!!
YOU MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY I ALMOST DROPPED MY BASS 2:56
It is SO true! Every time I start a project I find myself struggling to just finish it. I find that I fall in love with my ideas and it's so hard to create them without them being perfect, but the truth is... There is no perfect, only finished. I always have to remind myself of that but it's so true.\n\nOh, water is true too. #820hydrate
What next I finished watching the video???
Hi
New subscriberr sndkeb
nice.check my track\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NfHuDAnx4o
May 2009 was a month before you finished the extended NEVER (also the same month you put out BIRD SONG)
You are ridiculously productive.\nConsidering you put a music track and a video out in 3 days and considering the quality of the content this comes off as, well, insane.
I found this to be really inspiring, so thank you so much for making this video!\nAlso, I was just wondering: how do you distribute your music? And if you do it personally: which website do you use (and why)?
Of all times you host a meetup it's on my final exam :(
Damn I hate the new sound that plays when you upvote a comment
That's true. I never finish anything!!
aw mannnn, I wish I could go to the 1 million subscriber party tomorrow because I'm like 3 hours away in Ontario but I don't drive and I have college :c
Help, I'm too good at starting!\nAll I ever do is start. I don't think I've finished anything..
*looks at folder of unfinished projects*
There is no perfect, there is only finished.\n    -Andrew Huang 2017\n\nWords to live by.
I have a great voice
May 6th! That's my birthday! :D 3:02
Why Andrew? Why?! Why did you not emulsify your vinaigrette?
I am Finnish, thus I am complete.
Hey Andrew, you should try and make a song using different sounds from Doctor Who, just thought it would be cool.
that last song is quite beautiful. i agree with what you said about finishing projects. even though every work can be made better, at some point you want to share it with people. so you must decide what is more important to you, perfecting it, or getting it out there. i believe the whole point of creating something is to share ideas & connect with others.
*@ANDREW HUANG*\nGet a large and well isolated thermos and your ice water will last for hours and you don't need to go to the kitchen to refill it ;)
Once you see his eyebrows, you won’t be able to stop noticing them
These are some great tips! I've just started out with this whole music production thing, and I would highly appreciate it if you guys could give me feedback on my music: https://soundcloud.com/user-886261717  Keep making amazing stuff!
Can someone tell me what time the party is
I like how the title looks like click bait, but it isn't
So very true! Remember not to get caught up in the 'perfection' and move on to the next project.
How to make salad interesting
Hey Andrew, when will you finally visit Marti Fischer?
lmao i dont finish any of my art =(
Cannot love this video enough. I've been hearing this finish your shit message everywhere i look lately. Something tells me i should finish my shit
When you use the Push, how do you stay in key? Is it harder or easier than using a midi keyboard?
You hit one million
100%. This is the truth.
I didn't think I needed this but I did. Thank you.
Song challenge: play Foreigner's cold as ice with ice cubes
you should collab with Sharpe he makes beats too
Yessss - that was so GOOD brother, that last song had me in chills.
Honestly, thanks so much for saying this. I'm not a musician but i do 3d animation and models and stuff and a good majority of all the time i put into it result in unfinished projects that i'm not happy with and continue to put off saying i'll finish or fix it later but I never do.I'm glad you said something about it. Thanks
Finishing music is not easy to do
Is hard to see... 'cause it's glass.
There is no perfect, only finished. I'm taping this to my ceiling so I can stare at it when I go to bed and go to sleep.
Song Challenge: Elevator music. Make music with only the sounds from an elevator, either where you live or in a big city the next time you visit one. Bonus challenge: You can't make any of the sounds intentionally. Just ride an elevator a bunch of times recording all the sounds it makes, and the people inside. !!!
I mean I know you have 1+ mil subs but bro you deserve so many more
Did anyone actually win the million subs giveaway ? .. not me :( \n#ineverwinanything
That last song sounds so much like Coldplay I love it!!
it's hard to see because it's glass. i like this!
https://youtu.be/TkObLEgXnIU — that`s Andrew`s video from this february, that was recomended to me by youtube. Both this and that one are working both ways as prequel/sequel to each other being 9 mounths apart. Nice way to finish, keep it up.
i really like your setup! its so aesthetic
6:13 when it’ll get released?
This whole video is about the exact reason why I started my channel.
bro this video has a whole second sexual meaning
I just realized that I follow you because I envy you :l
This definitely isn't even restricted to art. It partially applies to the programming projects I do too, except finishing them takes more time.
Ive only realised this now after watching him for a year that has he ever had a voice drop?
How about a song like the intro to American Horror Story? Embrace the spooky season
And to find out what this one thing is, \n\nYou just have to buy my new book
Art is never finished, only abandoned.\n                                    Leonardo da Vinci
Thank-you for this video, Andrew. It's something I am trying to make myself understand as well as my friends too.  Keep up the inspirational videos!
Finishing is all about making decisions. And decisions are often hard.
Don't trust a perfect person, and don't trust a song that's flawless |-/
... You're everything i need XD Also, that last song was... So good.
The last track is the dreamest!!!
Inspiring as hell. 2 thumbs up from this guy
Very good man, thats what needed to hear today. I have some songs and music videos to finish that I have been working on for months or years and I just need to get them done.\nAlthough for me I find usually what gets in my way of finishing content is working with other people. When people join in on a project with me, it make it fun, but it always takes so much longer trying to schedule with them and to have them finish their part. Do you have any advice in that area? Thanks man. :)
Who won the competition
you're the most productive thing I've ever seen.

Andrew can you make music with a midi fighterlike Shawn Wasabi?
I'm a new artist and I have like 25 different song ideas on my computer and not one of them is finished. It's just so hard!
Your tracks are really dope. Very unique

I am 60 and watch you both
OMG YESSS! I'm so sick of every youtube channel being targeted to children and everything being censored and bleeped or not spoken about. I'm 20 years old and i struggle so hard to find people I relate to. and often even when I watch youtubers my own age, they still target their videos to children and do 'back to school crap and how to make friends etc. I was overcome with joy when louise did that big video about changing her channel and I think more people need to!!
Why wasn't Louise invited to the Janya wedding, tho?
The day Louise made the video announcing the change in her channel I hit subscribe so fast! I was so excited! Love when youtubers are genuine!
Louise and Tanya have never made a video together
the music is too loud
Okay, honestly, my favorite video of yours. Maybe ever? ❤️
I do RE at a catholic school and we are taught to believe that Genesis (Adam and Eve story) isn't actually true, and is just a metaphor for how powerful God is
I was not the one that lost it LOL
Jim gives me the fucking creeps he's like an overgrown 12 year old
Awe!! You all are so great!! Her hair is so pretty!!
I like to think of myself as a realistic christian Louise I don't think I've related to you more than when you were talking about religion.
it's like two work colleagues forced to work together
I’m 20. Should I ask my mom if I can watch this? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObviously kidding.
Ahhh I want a friendship like Louise and Jims :)
I am not a Christian, but if you don't take the 6 days of creation literally and assume a 'day' means a different length of time, the story is actually in the same order of creation as evolution.
Love both of your channels, Louise more so since her content changed. I've just turned 27 and always felt too old to watch some but you two have always been my favourites regardless. As you've both grown, I have too. Watching the two of you together is hilarious!
I started watching Louise more after the end of an era. I loved her more whilst she was being herself- i could sense she wasn't truly being herself in videos before that. Love you Louise!!!
Hi everyone,\nThis you tuber is trying to raise $50,000 for 10 Cancer Patients. Please donate if you can, thanks so much: https://www.gofundme.com/luckielifestyle\nHis Youtube Channel is: Luckie Lifestyle
Three Men and a Little Lady! Fave film 😍
What does 'lowering the tone' mean? I'm in the dark here...
omfg the background music is so distracting, its like fake laughter in tv shows pls stop
Im a Christian and I believe God created the Earth and everything in it, in all its sciency goodness. Im not the only one, theres tons of Christian scientists. Be open minded about it, you will be surprised by your own wrong misconceptions.
I love that the content changes because we can grow with you and watch the creator make the cc content they want to create. It feels more natural x
This video looked so awkward. Jim does not seem to be on the same page/feel comfortable throughout this entire video...
Jim, most Christians don't believe evolution and Christianity conflict...
Threw everyone I watch from Zoe all the way to Shane Dawson my mom has watched a least one video of ever YouTuber I watch. She has never complained about what they have been talking about especially how foul of a mouth Shane has. She realizes now they have all made me the person I am , she loves them all as well. She never once made me stop watching someone and it really helped our relationship and made it stronger with how much she trusted me. I just wish some parents would understand that , I'm not one myself...but it really helps the child trust me.
Aww I’ve missed these two together! 😁
Same thoughts re: evolution and Christianity.  Love Louise ❤️❤️
You look particularly handsome in this video Jim 😁
Irrelavant to the video but what lipstick does louise have on?
Was shookt when Louise said that Darcy was 6 years old!!! All I remember is itty bitty toddler Darcy 🙊
I THINK THAT the only reason why Loise wasnt invited to the wedding is bcos of Tanya...
Pretty woman? The film??
my name is Jim too HAHA
Oh😍 Jim you are so handsome!
i love the film louise was talking about Talladega nights : Ballad of Ricky Bobby <3
See, the two of you touching on religion has made me want to see a video purely talking about faith and religion. Especially as you have a degree on the same subject. Xx
I really enjoyed you talking to each other even more than answering the questions - especially the take on being a realistic Christian and mature content. Good stuff.
Dear louise, \n                             I think you are a great role model. You might of made some bad choices but you are still inspirational because you have managed to make a life out of your situations. You now have a beautiful daughter so keep bing louise\nXx
Honestly I cannot focus with the music in the background. Maybe it's just me but it drives me mad
The vast majority of Christians believe in evolution. Religious truth and scientific truth have the same source and therefore cannot contradict each other.
Is the thing Louise said at the start monsters Inc. Xx love you guys
I'm 12 and I watched the lost condom video lol
On the science/Christian thing - my brother is a ‘scientist’ (degree in science and science nerd) and he’s a devout Christian - preaches a lot etc. I think it’s all about being open minded and tolerant of everything. \n\nGreat video guys :-) you’re awesome!
I totally forgot I added a question and just for the fun of it I watched this video, finding out you answered my question! How cool is that! Thank you lots and lots for the answer and for turning it into a conversation about porn, hahaha. Ohh and Jim, you pronounced my name best! It's difficult, I know. Just say it as you read it! Much love again, Sjarlie!
I'm glad your content has matured. I started watching you when I was 16 and I'm 20 now so I've been able to grow up with your content.
Science was originally designed to prove christianity. Just because it has gone on to prove the theory of evolution it doesn't and shouldn't effect a persons belief in any religion.
Music is too loud and beat-ey
Jim 😂🙈😂 14:33 ahaja poor Louise \nmaybe subscribe. but if you don't want to don't omg
It’s so refreshing to see a Christian believe in something other than Adam and Eve, yet the way you explained it as thinking Adam and Eve is a metaphor is brilliant. It doesn’t belittle  the belief of Adam and Eve, but puts a reasonable sensible thought process to it.
Louise looks gorgeous! xx
You two are so funny together
Louise, I always thought you were younger than me, but we're the same age.
the movie is Angus thongs and perfect snogging
That end bit about subscribing to Louise made me laugh so hard.
i don't think the adam and eve story was meant to be like a direct description haha. most ppl take the view that the seven day creation thing is a v brief description of millions/billions of years of evolution. and the adam and eve story is to serve a purpose of telling the story of original sin and it explains well why the world can be bad. most christians believe that a lot of the bible consists of stories/metaphors that tell us something abt God. my idea of science is that is doesn't contradict religion at all, science is the study of God's creation! ^*^
JIM What hairdryer do you use, do you use it everyday, what hair product/s do you use and do you style your hair everyday?
Louise and Jim are the best combination, neither of you beat around the bush with what you're saying and I love it!
Jim, you definitely have the gift of gab (a great asset for you).When are you and Tyler doing another collaboration?
What was the movie was Louise talking about?
I am proud for  my family to watch Jims channel.  He is a sweetheart and  very real, not like the others who put on airs and  fake
When Louise and Jim were trying to call people my phone started ringing 😂
Would watch Jim and Tan in anything xxx such good videos!!!❤
this is the best video
Eminem ripping Trump a new one isn't on the trending list, but this total garbage is......
Is it bad , im 14 and i watch louises videos X
The ad on this video was your book on audible lol xx
I get my book tomorrow!!! So excited!
Louise has lost a good bit of weight go her
Subscribed to Louise after this. :)\nI looked at her channel AGES ago after a collab with Zoe or someone and didn't much like it but I guess that must have been towards the end of the old era. I like her stuff more now. Glad to have had her brought to my awareness again.
Right......... adult Q&A \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlet’s watch it anyway
I'm 14 you are both amazing role models! You make me happy! You make me less anxious! Your both great
Hey Jim! Please do more videos like this. I like seeing this side of you!
Barbera Streisand says that, is it funny girl or something?
I did love this video and what you guys were talking about! But the music was a bit annoying, I'm not sure if it was my headphones, but at times it was difficult to hear you guys :(
I thought I was the only one who believes that SOME of Christianity is a metaphor and doesn’t believe in Adam and Eve!
You two should make more videos! Enjoyed it immensely!
the music was fucking annoying - clicked off
I haven't watched Jim in years. I found the desperate to be a children's tv presenter vibe just too much.  Happy Louise has made a  reintroduction happen.
I am 10 years old and I watch both of them
HAHAH I want to hear Louise's story about losing the condom, anyone know which video that is??
Jim deserves more views.
I started my YouTube channel to get comfortable in front of a camera, I went to an acting school for tv and movies, and we were in front of cameras doing audition practice. So it was a way for me to get used to that. Now I love it!
Louise, my dad died when I was young. I think all the time about how in the future my kids will be able to watch my videos because I would have loved to have something like this of my dad. Im sorry about your mom, but I’m glad to know I’m not the only one who thinks about this
Love how real you both were in this, there should definitely not be more videos like this out there. X
When Harry met sally!!
Love Talladega Nights.

i'm not going to leave one of those mediocre comments saying 'oh i wish that they were all close like they were a few years ago' because the reality is, they've all found their path in life now. some, successful authors and others working in the fashion industry. ultimately, i'm so proud of all of them. they're all doing their thing, and are smashing it. well done 'old crew' of youtube <3

まだ米津さんがハチさんだけだった頃の楽曲は本当に凄いとは思ってたけど本格的に米津玄師として活動を始めてから嫉妬するほどにこの人はセンスがある。これからも頑張って欲しい。
Olha muito legal a música e tal\nMas porra por que não coloca o título em Inglês?\nalguém me ajuda\nComo é o nome dessas pessoas,  nome da música aaaaaa que foda
Attention! Here is my outstanding animation music video  https://youtu.be/InfbZaf7dTg\nWhich i lack the funds to promote. Please help bring the dream of a hard working man to life by sharing and liking the video. Thanks.
なんか伸び悪いな。\n高評価は多いんだけどなぁ。
米津さんだんだん目が見えてきた気がする\n自信の表れ的な
いや200万再生で高評価10万て…\n\n\n\n\n\n神か。しってた。
菅田さんと歌っているはずなのに菅田さんと歌っていますって描写が無くて歌詞に合っててステキです。
最高です(;_;)4:49の菅田くんが肩をぶつける様に右にブランコ揺らすとこ、泣けます
大好きな2人のコラボ。\n歌詞も歌声も映像もほんとに綺麗で\n奥深くて考えさせられるなぁって。\nずっと聴いていたいって思った。
これ恋人か友人の歌と思うんですけどどっちなんですかね？\n菅田くんとかいるし多分友人だと思うけど…
米津さんがしてるイヤカフ\nWEBERのJさんがコラボでデザインしたのと似てるなって思ってたら、まさかの本物でびっくりした。。\n知らず知らずだったとしても、こういうところで使ってもらってるの見たらファンとして嬉しくなるよね。。
菅田くんがタバコ吸ってるとこカッコイイ。\nこの曲、最高。感動する。
聞く前は菅田将暉とコラボかよ...と思ってたけど、聞いてみたらめっちゃええやん。菅田将暉好きになったわ
米津さんの曲はいつも荒んだ気持ちを落ち着かせてくれます。\n本当にありがとう。\nこれからも貴方の世界観で素敵な曲を作っていってください。
最近、初聴で涙が出るのは米津玄師だけです
まぁ菅田くん要る要らないの論争やらなにやらはあるけど\n米津玄師は菅田君使って再生回数稼ぎしてるとかアホなコメントが無くてよかったって思うわ( ᵟ ᵋ ᵟ )\nそういう所が米津さんのまた一つの凄さなのかなぁ
菅田将暉がブランコに座って煙草もってるゆるい感じがドストライク
菅田くん邪魔って\n米津玄師が菅田将暉をイメージして作った曲なんだから\nそもそも邪魔とかじゃなくね？？\n結局はこの曲を作った米津玄師をディスってる事になってない？？
好きなふたりがコラボとかそれだけで最高なのに\n米津さんの聞いたら耳から離れないような癖になる歌声と菅田くんの力強く心に響く歌声が素敵な歌詞とメロディーを届けてくれてもう神としかいいようが無いです。\nありがとうございます。\n大好きです。
最後の「始まりは青い色」って歌詞がなんかジオラマっぽい（伝われこの気持ち
今回のアルバムは今までの米津さんのアルバムっぽくないね\nトップアーティストのアルバムって感じになったね\nこれもこれで素晴らしいけれども
このふたり歌い方が似てる気がする
この二人だからこそだと思います\n涙を誘われました\n聴くの遅くなってとてもしにたい
謎めいたところが2人とも似てて 双子の神様に見える😌
え？俳優なんかとコラボ？って思ったけど菅田将暉歌うまいし米津さんと雰囲気マッチングしててめっちゃよかった…
すれ違うように君に会いたい 心情をとても上手に表現してる
お母さんが菅田将暉好きで私は米津さんが好きだから2人で一緒に見れる機会になってよかった〜！
米津さんの歌詞も大好きだし絵も大好きだしあの体に染み渡るような声も大好き！\nただ最近テレビ出たりpv顔出しとか露出が多くなってきて米津さん自身になにか変化があったのかな〜なんて考えてる
偶然あなたへのオススメに出て来たので再生して見ました。初めて米津玄師さんの歌を聞きましたが何故か心拍数がグッと上がってドキドキしました。天才と呼ばれている理由がわかりました。
聞くたび毎回いいねを押せるようにしてくれないかなぁ☆
有名になったことをいい方向にとっていろんな人とコラボしたり自分をもっと表にだしたりほんとに素敵
菅田将暉も素敵だけどやっぱり米津さんと一緒に歌うと米津さんすごいな。って改めて思います2人とも素敵ですけどね！
米津さんコラボ最近ありますね。\n\n今回の歌も最強です(*｀･ω･)ゞ。\nもっといろいろな曲作ってくださいm(._.)m
中居くんとコラボしてみたらどれだけの批判が湧くのか知りたいな。\nってことで米津さんよろしくお願いします
神様がご降臨なされました\n私、幸せ者でございます
打ち込みで曲作ってた頃と比べると、めちゃくちゃいろんな人と関わるように社交的になって成長を感じる
袖丈が覚束ない夏の終わり\n明け方の電車に揺られて思い出した\n懐かしいあの風景\n\nたくさんの遠回りを繰り返して\n同じような街並みがただ通り過ぎた\n窓に僕が映ってる\n\n君は今もあの頃みたいにいるのだろうか\nひしゃげて曲がったあの自転車で走り回った\n馬鹿ばかしい綱渡り　膝に滲んだ血\n今はなんだかひどく虚しい\n\nどれだけ背丈が変わろうとも\n変わらない何かがありますように\nくだらない面影に励まされ\n今も歌う今も歌う今も歌う\n\n忙しなく街を走るタクシーに\nぼんやりと背負われたままくしゃみをした\n窓の外を眺める\n心から震えたあの瞬間に\nもう一度出会えたらいいと強く思う\n忘れることはないんだ\n\n君は今もあの頃みたいにいるのだろうか\n靴を片方茂みに落として探し回った\n「何があろうと僕らはきっと上手くいく」と\n無邪気に笑えた　日々を憶えている\n\nどれだけ無様に傷つこうとも\n終わらない毎日に花束を\nくだらない面影を追いかけて\n今も歌う今も歌う今も歌う\n\n朝日が昇る前の欠けた月を\n君もどこかで見ているかな\n何故か訳もないのに胸が痛くて\n滲む顔　霞む色\n\n今更悲しいと叫ぶには\nあまりに全てが遅すぎたかな\nもう一度初めから歩けるなら\nすれ違うように君に会いたい\n\nどれだけ背丈が変わろうとも\n変わらない何かがありますように\nくだらない面影に励まされ\n今も歌う今も歌う今も歌う\n\n朝日が昇る前の欠けた月を\n君もどこかで見ているかな\n何もないと笑える朝日がきて\n始まりは青い色
米津玄師さんが歌う曲は最高
朝日が〜のとこらへんは米津玄師っぽいメロディだし、\nどれだけ背丈が変わろうとものとこは菅田将暉の見たこともない景色思い出すメロディに聞こえるの私だけ？
この2人の歌とか聞かなくても神曲と分かってしまうwそして聞くと想像以上の神曲でした！
Twitterで米津さん、菅田将暉がいなければこの曲は成り立たなかった。この曲作るためにはどうしても菅田将暉が必要だった。みたいな事おっしゃってましたが、本当にその通りです。素敵な曲です。
米津玄師の声聞いてると\nマジ落ち着くわ〜
アルバム買う人👍
目から汗が…( ´•̥̥̥ω•̥̥̥`)
髪フサフサや、、、
この人のファン嫌い
音楽番組で歌ってほしいな～
最っ高なんだけど
なにしてんの
組み合わせ意外
聞くの遅くなったけど最高…
VCRVHBD B😯😈😆😊😕😆😬😕😊.
開始一秒から好きです
このCDが買いたい💕💕💕
PVよくみたらすごいな...
めっちゃ好き
どこがいいんだよ！意味わかんねえ
最＆高つかえば高評価増える説www
毎回思うんだけど、米津さんの滑舌が好き
毎日聞いてる󾬍
3:53 ←ここのとこ特に好き
米津さんの付けてるイヤカフ！！\nJさんの！！？？？
米津玄師さんの耳に目がいく私
めっちゃいいじゃん...
また神曲がふえた
心なしか歌い方似てるね
米津さんアイコン変えたな
染みる
いい声
髪型すごく素敵です
米津さん最高です👐
又是神曲一首\n米津\n超讚！
この際メトロノーム聞いて欲しい
胸が痛くての米津さんの声が良すぎて、、！！！
通学中に聴くの最高
控えめに言って最高
米津さん大好き
再生回数の伸びが凄すぎる！！\n\nまだまだ伸びろーーーー
やっぱり米津さんはすばらしい\n･ﾟ･(｡>д<｡)･ﾟ･
最高!!アニメEDとかだったら最高～
イヤカフ同じのもってる…嬉しい。泣きそう
最高かよ
*<3*
米津さん神です大好きです😍💓💓
はい鳥肌〜^_^
聞いたらわかる\n\n\n\n\n\n\nハマるやつやん
是非Mステ出て欲しい‼️
神曲。
菅田将暉ってタバコ吸うんだ？
えっ、天才？（すっとぼけ）
ああ、彼の曲は素晴らしい
菅田将暉\n歌声も顔もかっこいいけど\n聴き飽きる声やわ\nわかる？わかる？\n米津玄師さんはきもちいいねん
半分聴いて「えっ…どうなのこれ」って思ったけど、菅田くんのパートになって「あっいい」って思った。\n米津さんは完全に、初期の自己主張が刺々しい頃のエゴを捨て去って、広告のための曲とかアニメのための\n曲のような、「誰かのための曲」が書けるようになったんだと思う。\nそれってすごーく、大人になったってことだと思う！これからもどんどんコラボし続けて欲しいです！
何故か理由もないのに胸が痛くて   の 胸が の掠れて消えかかったような、灰色がかった声のところすき      ちょっと分かりづらいな...
神コラボ。
Tom we REALLY want a video about Lance explaining what he does to take care of is skin!!!!!!!!!
Glad to see Tom had got Lance to loosen up a bit, more relaxed and enjoying himself. The combo works well together.
I TOTALLY howled @ lance Creaming should be after dinner....at least that's been my experience 😉
*points at wedding ring*\n-I own you!\n\nI LITERALLY GONNA DIE I NEED AN AMBULANCE
i think this video is most sweetest video that i liked so much..💞💞💞
Lance made so many inuendos...I love it!
Bloody Fantastic vid!  So happy to know that Lance's 10 Meter Scream is next!!
I love Lance. I wish he was in every video.
I want to see a version where you have to guess stuff about lance

You three are the perfect combo, please do more videos together. Lance shines in this video, he is so funny! really looking forward to the 10m video.
Your best freind is apparently not watching all your collab vids 😂 You had a discussion with Nile about the famous person thingy in his vid
Hi Tom,\nI Love you so much especially for the work out exercises. (Little less than Lance do). I know for a fact that you are not political person. But would you be able to do a video about the people  who are very unfortunate that they are born in countries like MIDDLE EAST, INDIA, RUSSIA. I would start loving you more than Lance. \nI swear.\nStill Love You even if you don’t. \nThanks Heaps.\nFrom\nWell let’s say Unfortunate Tom Daley
My daily dose of cute, sexy fun!
He’s like a British version of Connor Franta😂

Forget husband, I wish I had a BF Q_Q....\n\nBut at least I can watch these....

Is he gay????
Did anyone else notice that ‘husband’ kissed ‘best friend’ at 17:35
Wait toms gay?
Ugh! Lance. Such a douche!
Tom, you`ve become a little bit feminine.
How does someone look that young at 43.. I guess getting creamed regularly is the secret?
Lance and Sophie i rekon both need another pie for the question they both got wrong! For the chicken strips one. 513,137 now, in 2days
I used to fancy Tom but he's too camp now...
we know who's the bottom now
Is Sophie bi? Cause she is cute as hell! ❤️❤️❤️
Your g.a.y😞😕
Why did it take me like 5 min to figure out who the husband and who the best friend was in thumb nail 😭😂😂
i didn't know that tom daley is gay
i love him and i know hes wearing nice clothes and all but tom was a little whinny  you knew you where going to get creamed
Your Gay?
Is your best friend Sofe has someone in her life?, coz I am interested
What is sixth form 😂 he's a confused american ! 😂😂
What the actual fuck i wrong with the comment section? Idiots saying the family should have gotten eaten for some mangy animal that's worth a dime a dozen? Who really cares whether or not it's a wolf or an abandoned pet? And how do any of you know the family fed it? Deers run out into traffic becaue their stupid, if you think a dog is any different for chasing a large, moving vehicle then you have problems. It's probably covered in fleas, stinks and would rip your throat out without giving it a second thought. For everyone saying the family with the child should have stopped and petted the random, dangerous animal, do everyone a favor and go do this yourself. People like you don't need to breed.
Probably has rabies it's a wolf people come down cold be mixed with coyote
He looks so addorable, why dont you get off and pet him
I would have pulled over and pet him
That looks like a beautiful husky mix.  Must be lost.  I would have stopped to see if it came whimpering up to the window wagging it's tail like a lost dog before giving it that kind of chase, and on a desolate highway! How stupid. Could have caused a major accident
wtf is wrong with this family
Why are they not just driving off he could get hit by truck!
i think people have fed that before not the people making the video but someone who might have seen the wolf on the side of the road and thrown food out the window to him
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂that wolf almost got them😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Oh man....I'd have stopped and given him a ride. He acts like a tame wolf who's lost. I'd have him sleeping on my bed.
This is some Bull Sh**!! Those animals don't just follow you.
that wolf is sick of being in the wild. he wanted a home.
The Wolf wants a home 😢😭
That’s a Siberian Husky...Wolves are wayy bigger. Why would a wolf chase a car in the first place? That was someone’s pet for sure.
probably a pet you idiots. get out much?????
0:30 shows how smart they are and also I'm sure they wanted y'all to hop out and say hello and good bye sense you are just driving by there territory of I am correct and or they wanted a ride some were
Who seen the collar tag a 0:07 that's there dog and then listen to wat there are saying
Fuckers should of atleast threw some food out for making it run so far
That's a Husky, not a wolf.
he must have been fed by people in the past.  no other reason to keep following you .
Pissed on the floor one to many times.
I would let him in my car tbh..
That was crazy! Could have at least stopped and gave the poor dog water.....
Help the poor fella , he needs help
Can somebody take this video off of You tube.  This poor dog wanted these idiots to help him.  Take this video off.
That looks like my dog.
i hope this happens to me for some stupid reason....C:
This looks exactly like my sweet ranger who I got as a stray. It breaks me
If he's a dog where is his collar? Hope it wasn't a dog. 😢 i would hate to think it was lost
they dumped that dog. it was a mix wolf. it was chasing them down. it did not wabt to be lwft behind.
This is sad,he seems hungry.I would have thrown out my middle child.I wont part with my first born or the baby but the awkward middle one would make a good sacrifice.
something is not right about this video.... it made me sad for some reason
Hes warning about the future serial killers
Why wouldnt one stop? See what the wolf would of done. So few if any man and animal encounters like that in life.
I would  have  had to  stop  and see  what the issue was.
That was no dam full wolf, \nthat was a wolf dog a husky mix morons.\n\nThat poor animal obviously \nHe was lost.
PLOT TWIST: Little Red Riding hood is in the car.
It was a Hybrid. Trying to get a ride home! Probably the Sadistic Family in the cars pet!
That's a tame wolfy wanting back in the car, someone dropped em off
😓 this is what happens when people feed wolves... Then they think the cars will always feed them and will eventually get hit. Happened to kujo! Can happen to these poor mutts
HE JUST WANTS TO PLAY
That looks like a tamed dog maybe he wanted help lol
These people sound like straight air heads
You can tell that this wolf has been raised by someone and it just wanted to connect with these people.
Click bait! Wolf is not in a car.
He's looking for a pack. Humans a compatible with Canines do to the fact we have the same hierarchy. He was ran out of a pack and left to fend for himself. that is the way of the wolf pack.
I live around 10 minutes away from radium bc,  Ive often seen wolves in the park. and on occasion they have been known to chase cars. people feed them on the highway. this is what happens. its unfortunate
He just wanted to rip her face off and eat the children.. Why did t they stop to take selfies o\nWith the wolfen
That was a Siberian Husky, not a wolf. He was well groomed and is more than likely someone's lost pet, looking for his owner.  He may have been dumped and your vehicle could be the same as his owner's.  What type of vehicle were you driving and around what area was this. We need to send  people to the area to try to locate this dog.
Its  a  pet,  not  a  wild wolf, frolicking,  perhaps  looking for a  human to  feed,  love
Probably hungry because of all the tweeker poachers...just sayin
Reading the title I thought the family was on foot and the wolf was driving a car
That is hybred not wild !  Click bait !
That was someone's pet. She thought you were going to save her from the wild. 😞
this animal was domestic at one time abandoned, &  wants to get back to the easy life
It's not chasing you,but we should
obviously domesticated animal ,, wild wolf would never do this ,, looks more mixed breed ,, sad should have stopped and investigated more ,, there car must have looked familiar ,
Wolves are very tall they have very long legs JS and the stupid people could of gotten him ran over
Looks more like a husky than a wolf.
that's not a wolf
I would have picked it up....he didn't seem wild at all.
That looks nothing like a wolf.
These people fed the wolf. Then after feeding him they drove very slowly encouraging the wolf to follow thinking it would get more food. Possibly even holding more of whatever they fed it out the window to encourage it. It looks like a heavily wooded area, possibly a tourist destination where animals are fed all the time.
That seems to have been someone' pet at 1 time. because wild animals don't keep on if you leave what they are protecting they stop  chasing you.
looks like they drove out to remote location & put the family dog out. Hes chasing them because he knows hes been abandoned would be my guess.
Say my name, say my name. PERFECT MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND.
For all of you that are saying this is a wolf it is not it is someone's dog it was posted on missing pets of British columbia
If I was the people I would jump out swoop him up and keep him as my pet or if he has owners help find them
That's a dog. How can you not see that. Never seen a real wolf before?
dumassess its a husky ive seen wolves up close even pet them these people being stupid
Forgot to add that's a beautiful animal!!!!
Are they strong for not stopping or am i weak cause i would have?
people are stupid. why did this show in my feed? ugh
Regular wolves stay away from humans... It's obvious that the animal was probably a pet at some point and was abandoned or lost... They're so MEAN for taunting the animal like that!!! 👿😡😡 they probably fed it, and that's why it was following them! Also, usually don't wolves come in packs? It's pretty strange to see one going on its own like that...
That is not a wolf!!  That looks like an Alaskan Malamute that appears to have been left and probably was hoping to get in the car!! How sad for this poor dog!!   I have had Malamutes for years and always get people commenting, Is that a wolf?  NO!!!  Not to mention, wolves are incredibly shy and would be highly unlikely to chase a car!!
Maybe the wolf is a spirit or guardian angel... that one of the family members lost someone that they were close to so the wolf is coming to say hi
It is not a wolf, it is a domestic Husky. Hopefully his owners find him...terrible sad.
Dude my Uncle has the Exact same Pet.Bro its a husky mix wolf and I feel bad for the poor thing these people are stupid tryna to get attiontion on YouTube this is a crying shame!
You and your family do have my sympathy for having to deal with all these crude, evil and generally stupid people in your comment section. Anyone expecting any of you to exit the vehicle and approach a wild, potentially dangerous animal is frankly just insane. I, unlike everyone else it seems, read the full description of the video and know that there was no service in your area at the time to calling the park service or anyone else for that matter to try and aid the _possibly_ lost animal. There was nothing you could have done save for just driving away quickly. True, I suppose you could have tried to get the attention of a passing driver for help but honestly, what could they have done either? Not many people would be willing to drop everything they are doing to assist strangers who are trying to assist a wolf/dog without knowing what its intentions really are. And believe me when I say *nobody* knows what this animal really wanted. There are a dozen reasons why it could look happy, wagging its tail and chasing your car. Even if you put it in your car what assurance would you have had that it would not simply attack?
Oh My Goodness 😍🐺❤️
Such a majestic boy
So cute, wolves are awesome

I love this song it is relaxing song
Hasbro,\nI know you probably get comments like this alot I apologize but I just want to say how fantastic the My Little Pony Movie was! The animation was spot on, and I loved that Tempest Shadow realized that accepting friendship is much better then being evil. I also liked the Hanazuki short film the theater I was at showed just before the movie. Nice job Hasbro!
But srsly i love this song, and I really don't like pop...
I love the animation in this
Love it so awesome and glorious  💗💗💗💗💖💖💖💖💖

Y'all lovin' the song while I'm just here like, I can see After Effects, and I miss the devoted work I used to put towards it\nNot to boast, but give me a week of tutorials and I could've made this.

3:10 YAY TRIXIE!Hasbro made a really good PMV not like EG ones.
Congratulations your movie its amazing i love it so much
Come to the eagles
It's crazy this made me really think and a lot of his issues weren't drugs, it was him handling the stresses of life. Grant it he didn't have a great start with drugs but if you listen closely you'll see. my college coaches taught me how to drink detox everyone thought i was a junkie, so i said eff it. It seems that was obviously his coping mechanism but no one helped this man, not even himself. To change you really gotta tear down the whole thing so you can rebuild. Everyone was giving him a quick fix, even himself. He looks great now and ability wise he's been a top tier talent. Hopefully he gets reinstated
Marijuana actually is probably rather helpful to NFL players.
The sane human inside me loves to see his growth. The Ravens fan however hates the fact he may be back on the field.
We love you here in CLE Josh
At the end of the day he has no one to blame but himself, there are plenty of people who came from rough neighborhoods but decided that drugs were not for them, and that they wanted to make something of their life. It isn't like Josh Gordon did not have second, third and fourth chances, because he has had plenty of chances. I say he will never play for the Browns again and probably will never play in the NFL Again.  He made the Commissioner look like a fool when he reinstated him during the 2016 Training Camp, because ultimately Gordon chose drugs over the NFL.
I still cant believe a guy that smokes weed is being punished more than abusers and animal killers. Vick is on tv as an ANALST! A fucking analyst, that we look at and listen to in hope to gain some perspective. Think about that and look at Josh. I get what he is going through too. I can smoke weed once a month and never need anything else, but it stays in your system so long you get your fix through more harmful ways like alcohol to not get in trouble. With that said and we literally look at people around us, if he is such a drug addict how can he be so healthy? The NFL is wrong for doing this, the suspensions only make situations like this worse fir the individual. His legal problems are fixed faster than his NFL problems. Unless there is a performance enhancement issue/violence then the NFL should stay out of it and support it's own assests. ☝
Now all he needs is to get out of Cleveland
Him talking about his dad is so sad. He still loves him and hasn't even talked to him for 12 years.
Really proud of the work you have done big guy, can't play ping pong though!!
He’s a beast, the browns need him back and hope he can stay clean. At 26 he has a lot of good football left In him
Why do we have to listen to Steven A Smith coon ass before his interview? Did he intentionally want us to listen to the naysayers are what? Steven coon ass don’t have the right to be done with nobody but his own children if he have any?
And the Browns decided to draft that enabler piece of shit Manziel, who fed Josh more drugs. \n\nFucking dumbest franchise in all of sports.
arguably the most talented receiver I've seen not named randy moss
This man is a freak on the field. Hope he gets the chance to come back.
trustingod
Let’s go falcons pick this man up just makes us that much better
Dry told on baylor..
Inspiring! Way to be a complete man, Josh. Time for you to put up over 200 back to back yards on your demons. You got this!
NFL time to give him another chance! Good luck JG
He must be broke now
This guy hasn't learned anything.  He doesn't need to be worried about football, he needs to be worried about his life and about his daughter that he has never met.  I guarantee that if he gets back on the football field and suffers a career ending injury, he will OD soon after if he doesn't get his head right.  Football is a privilege, not a right.
When life situations transcend sport and the game its related to ,... It reveals the most beautiful aspect of sports in general. Specifically in this all too common story of addiction. When a man is stripped of everything he loves and forced to confront his demons head on, its a defining moment that will break or rebuild his life, not just in his sport but his life as a whole. Josh Gordon speaks eloquently and direct about his experience so well thats it gives me hope that he can come back. I cheer for guys who can lose it all and fight their way back. Its a test of the human condition. Now that's a player and athlete i can root for.  -Eagles fan-
Big Fan of Gordon!  Even more now listening to him and can see he trying whatever it take to change and step up to be a father. Hope Cleveland want to trade him. Jerry Jone need to watch this and trade a 1st round draft for him.   Best of luck to you J Gordon.
Hes from texas , of course he sippin lean 😂
Countdown waiting on you big dog stay on the path
I’m rooting for you Flash! Keep working, get your life together and get back in the league!
Very powerful. A lot of these guys will lose their job and give up and give into the temptation that led them to lose everything in the first place. It’s good to see people make change from their past and give their all to right their wrongs. I hope I’ll see JG on the field soon.
Come back to Cleveland young man .
I have faith he'll stay clean. And once hes out, come to phi, the Eagles need you haha
What kind of camera does uninterrupted use ? Anyone know
This was awesome..See ya soon Flash..✌🏾
wish him the best i pray the brotha turns it around and heals himself football or not
Eli Manning needs you, the NY Giants need you #MakeItHappen 🙌🏾🏈
I failed this drug test because I was getting high... Thats a very mature answer, I like that.
BECAUSE HE CAN'T STAY OFF THE WEEEDUH???
As a fan you never truly realize what someone is going thru...prayers up for JG 🙏🏻
Fuck the NFL. Go to Canada. It's bullshit!! All this fucking trying to humble a player is bullshit!!! Fuck that!!! They play football!! They do not make laws, they don't do shit but play football. I am sick of Americans and their fucking contradictions. Expect more from a person who does nothing to impact my life than a person who can impact my life. I do not expect anything from athletes. I expect my President to not be a separator, congress to not be full of old white people, jobs paying people every two weeks or once a month. I mean real things. I wonder what did Kerry Collins have to do. What about Riley Cooper. Hmmm, yup, full of shit!
Man he looks lost. He needs God like us all
The Bills need a receiver badly right now.  Hope he gets reinstated and they take a look at signing him.
Never give up! Great video ❤
Give this guy a chance fuck wasting his potential
7:27  Anyone know who that is on the back of Gordon's hoodie?
Going through same things dui in 2014 and still going but this helps me maintain
Hope my Bengals call and give you a chance
Great job Josh! Awesome to see a positive story in today's world! Keep up what you're doing bro! My BEARS could DEFINITELY use you haha..
mannnnnn, i'll take him in New England in a heartbeat
they need to make a full documentary series of this guy
damn son, this more than weed
Still love you bro! Miner set back for a major come back
Wait so the schools help athletes violate ncaa policy? But I thought it was all about amateurism and education?
Carolina go get this guy🙏\n\n#Another chance\n#KeepPounding
ill believe it when I see it
So basically this is letting everyone know he’s going to the patriots next year
I failed the drug test because I was getting high. man this makes me change my opinion about him. hope he gets on the field soon. God knows the Browns need him
Good to see him working on him self ..
Bro holla at the giants we definitely need some help
Idk why but I get a Jon Jones vibe from this. I hope Josh leaves this behind and gets back to the league.
I'm praying for this young man to succeed. It should start with being a good person first.
I pray the Chicago bears get him 🐻
I believe in you bro, always have always will. You still have the chance to be the greatest ever. #JoshGordon
All the best to him, he seems like he's really taken some huge steps forward. I really hope it all works out for him, from people I know in my life this is incredibly tough to deal with.
His drug use never effected his performance from what I seen not encouraging it when your making millions of dollars but I am not worried about him not being the same at all he got help\nAt the right time never showed he was washed now all he has to do is stay clean.
Give him a couple million and he would f up again
I hope he can make it back in the league!
Somebody has to say it! - How long until he is traded to NE? ....
I've have never seen a joint worth a million dollars
I believe in you J.G.\nI sincerely hope you can become a father. Be blessed.
Can he play football next year?
He would’ve been on Julio, Odell, and Antonio’s level
Weed should just be cool with NFL. Since 90% of them have brain damage retiring
*i want my Bears to somehow get him* 🐻
Stay strong my brother we all make mistakes keep the grind up don't look back
Man he went around the streets, knocking on people’s door, asking random people where he could find weed. All he had to do was knock on my door. I would have directed him to Johnny Manziel’s Twitter page.
Lamar high school proud 💯
6:39 Tyrone Biggums sighting
Hope he can redeem himself. Fantastic talent.
Fuck skip bayless
Good luck Josh...
Go to dallas
Amazing
Rooting for u josh keep pushing Brody!

Prove em wrong!
ayeee shout out to Turbo Taylor
There is no detox drink that works as he described. Too bad this perennial failure has to try and attribute his mistakes to other people. I see no growth.
Josh imma need the name of these detox drinks
Am I the only one who was sweating the guy might fail a drug test before I even finished the video?? Thats all nice talk, but dude only wants reinstated to make money. Hes never seen his baby but wants to be a father? I grew up with countless guys like him, buddies who would talk about getting their lives together but never would. Always excuses. He will never stay clean for long. It takes a certain kind of personalty to conquer substance abuse. He dont got it.
hope he gets a 2nd chance in the league.
From a long time browns fan i truly believe Josh Gordon had all the god given talent to be a hall of fame wide receiver and in 2013 he had 1600+ receiving 9 td's and went to the pro bowl, this has to be the most talented person I have ever seen literally throw it away, in the future I wish him the best but I think he will regret the decisions he made later in life.
He had multiple chances but keep fucking up
Iv done all these drugs that he said he's done multiple times before and never got addicted , he doesn't have a problem he's just immature
He is an idiot. He has had so many chances already.
I shouldn't have gotten up today.
This is genius. I'm surprised I never thought of how good of a comparison this is. D.Va's my favorite overwatch hero and I love the Umaru-chan anime. Great video
Not a fan of Overwatch.\n\nHuge fan of Himouto Umaru-Chan.\n\nHave my thumbs up.
That is SO CUTE! GG <3

This is why I live.
i've put off this anime for far too long. it's time to watch it
1 year spent well, ps if you didn't know this being put on Crunchyroll roll news, that's how I got here 👍
Holy shit. I almost feel like watching this anime just from this video
This is what actual perfection is. <3
this is awesome, really well done.
For some reason the lucio at 0:16 has me dying LOL
If pure perfection ever existed, this would be it
380 subs ?? man life is unfair ;__; i really love your work keep it up <3
So good, i love it
How did I end up here lol. Totally worth it tho.
THIS VIDEO SAVED ME. Great job!!!!! <3
They should hire you! :O
Good work. Now like my comment, Glayer :3
¡Genial! Love it!
Ничего не понимаю,но это ОХУЕННО!!!
Почему если автор считает если показать Dva няшной анимешной дурочкой то это будет  нормально? Этот опенинг же бессмысленный... Это может понравиться только гигнутым фанам ониме, но со взгляда нормального человека это такая срань...

How about having Eddie Bravo on? He trains some top UFC/mma fighters and can promote EBI which is damn exciting for any bjj/mma fans. C'mon Ariel, show Edgy Brah some love.
Please make the into screen longer next time
Tony I went big bear Ferguson..
MMA HOUR get Gegard Mousasi Fighting BELLATOR 185
Tony just rambles on....lol....love that dude though!👊
Uncle Creepy spiraling...
Ariel is so cringe. Stop trying to psychoanalyse the fighters, you say the same thing about the fighters you interview being completely different people nearly every single time. You look for depth where it isn't there.
It is what it is
Ian McCall is such a garbage fighter. He should be happy that UFC let him stay this long.
When you get home from Taco Bell 2:56:54
Man Condit is such a good dude very under rated...that Maia fight was a disappointment but I feel Condit still causes problems for anyone would love to see Condit vs Cerrone Condit vs Woodley Condit vs Wonderboy\n\nHope he's well off, dude was doing medical stuff? Sounds like he hated it cant go from fighting in the UFC and being top 5 to work a regular day job. \n\nGet in the gym Carlos everyone knows grappling is your weakness work on it and destroy 170
BOBBY GREEN. ON THE MMA HOUR ARIEL MAKE IT HAPPEN
Can we please not have Ian McCall on the show ever again. Would be great.
Ian mccall wants 100k to fight on the fight pass prelims lol Thats a Lil bit of a reach dawg
Show with sound begins @ 3:58
GooD To SeE HelwanI AnD CucuY BacK TogetheR <3
Ian McCall is transitioning into a woman.
Ian mccall is such a douche im gald he dont fight anymore
Tony's been writing a book? What's it called Cat? And then you open the book and there is a picture of a cat and an arrow with the word Cat in bold. Then you turn the page and its another type of cat with an arrow and the word Cat!.  Just 50 pages of that. I'd buy it.
Lol @020:28 StarTrek s***. - Demetrious Johnson. What a great analogy. Haha
Yes Ariel the pro Mcgreggor fans are very annoying. Good to hear I'm not the only one who can't stand them.
so glad condits back. and so much respect to Alessio. awesome to hear from him and get some insight on how everything went from his perspective.
Tony Ferguson is so irritating and bodacious! Man, I can't wait to see someone knock this clown out.
Tony is so intense he made a Starbucks story intense
Caldwell did not win that fight that's all he did was hold and stall
Tony the real champ
Tony straight up Ferguson
NBK IS BACK!!!!
Holloway dating a hot model? His ex was just a couple of notches above that
Ric: Who said it was the best sub?\nAriel: OHHHHHH MMYYYYY,,,\n\nHAHA favorite part is when Ariel and Ric just talk. Both actually understand and know what is happening.
every time a bigger name fighter has a bad weight cut.....OMG we need more weight classes.   because you know that will end bad weight cuts.   Forget all the factors that come into play.
theeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee mixed martial arts hour back in. your llife.  same time same place same blababalal until then i say peace......im outta heeeeerre
Tony is the real champ, Conor is a paper champ !!! Lmao 😂
The mighty wizz bar.. really?
Tony Absolutely Ferguson
Tony Ferguson rocks!
2:56:54 Excuse me!
slow day lets rattle conor fans... lol
too chinny for Conor
lol @ ric thinking that push by GSP is real and that he's upset
Might need to re-upload this --- missing the sound first 4 minutes of Ariel talking :(
Was it muted in the first 4mim for everyone else too?
DJ and Max are class acts...
EL CUCUY!!!
marissamal
Straight up
greatest my arse.guy beats no named cans, gtfoh
Too many politics in this episode. I get it though. But lets not make a habit of it!
Always good to hear from Frankie, also I agree Tony's demeanour seemed much more composed.
does Max have any idea how ridiculous he sounds when he speaks? Saying you know every 4 words makes you sound like a moron. I like Max, he's dope AF, just hard to listen to.
NY Ric better at pronouncing those names than Schaub is.
I thought it was supposed to be RICS PICS not Ariel criticizing every pick from Rick. Rics picks is all I watch cause Ariel is beginning to annoy me.
no audio for first 4 minutes???
Dis, is not a terapy session - Ian McCall's Skype connection.
Ian McCall wants loads of money to fight but can't actually fight cause his hand is jacked LOL
Tony needs to take a chill pill lol
i did that armbar in big bear
Carlos Condit is the man. My fav fighters : Diaz Bros,Condit, Rory, Gegard Mousasi, and for sure DJ, TJ and Rockhold have a very well rounded skillset and a high fight IQ.
wtf no time stamps who dropped the ball
I keep thinking that max holloway is a really cool guy
So Ariel thinks the ufc's bantemweight division is the sister division to bellators version ayyt ariel i see you
2:56:54 Was that a cart from Tony?
Ian Mccall is ass
So Ian McCall basically is saying he pulled a wanderlai??? Usada came over and....wtf???
Maybe in the 165lb division...AAAAAYYYYOOOOO!
Saki vs. Roundtree is a dope ass fight.
Tonys mind is bullet proof !!
Sensei Seagull is a fraud! He got choked & pooped himself!
LAS VEGAS WAS A FALSE FLAG
Was that a fart 2:56:54
Tony is gullible if he thinks Dana speaks the truth.
Wtf ian hasnt fought in years nd he wanna get paid more wtf he just need to retire he a nobody lost to dj he doent want it to fight no more he should quit cus he aint top 5 nd he wanna get paid like he a champ no way
Condit is one of my favorite fighters and one of the most entertaining fighters I've ever seen. He's had a rough last few fights (as he said, the Maia loss was so ugly for him, he decided to leave the sport), but I think he's still one of the pound-for-pound best. Over the last half of his career, he's only lost to the best-of-the-best and only by the narrowest of margins. He was injured during the Woodley fight, Lawler was a razor-thin split decision, he avenged his Kampmann loss, and St. Pierre is St. Pierre. One weakness that he has is he doesn't fight takedowns enough. He's so skilled & active off his back, that getting taken down is almost a comfortable position for him. The problem is, even if he's not taking damage on the ground, the judges see it & tend to score against him because of that. Plus, he tends to brawl too much. If he had gotten a few takedowns against Lawler (nobody ever tries to take Robbie down) he would've won that fight and might be the champ right now.
Artem Lobov vs DJ. UFC let's make it happen
Tony vs Conor....Let's go! Hey....hello....hello....Conor? Conor?? where u at? :)))
Conor's are exhibition fights , ha, ha , ha good one Max
Condit is and has always been a fighter's fighter. Gotta love the guy, hope he makes a run and gets another crack at Tyron. #NBK
Tony is great fighter but if he's that hittable in first 5 min against Conor he might get ko'd.
What? Flying Suplex Armbar?? The next finishing move on DJ's list will be Zangeifs 'Final Atomic Buster'. You read it here first.
Tony might be weird and a genius at the same time.
I like Tony but he can be full of himself sometimes when he talks about how exactly he likes the fight to go down after a win.  Give me a break Tony....nobody wants a war like the fight you had with RDA.  And definitely you did not want to be mounted by Kevin Lee (you weren't getting out of that if it wasn't for the bell).  Just say it like it is Tony.  With that being said, you're a great fighter.  \n\nHope you get that Mcgregor fight.
Ferguson will desyroy mcgregor.
The earth is flat
2:56:55 ferguson farts
conor will destroy this guy
Ferguson vs khabib this fight make sens for us!!😂😂
Caldwell breaking the record for most stoned guest of all time
Sometimes Ariels asks the dumbest questions ever
LIST OF GUESTS PLEASE
Buy #assignment #dissertation #essay #coursework #thesis with 75% Discount | writershelp.co.uk/
Stamp times, please? And how lazy that you couldn't even list the guest list initially - well, it's even in numerical order. And when they do the time they're usually erroneous. Ariel is the best MMA journalist and this is the best mma podcast. I do appreciate all the effort but just such significant things, but it's somewhat unprofessional. :)
DJ wants the easy route. Lame fighter. Retire already
Mousasi the real lb for lb best sorry DJ.
El Cucuy. love the work ethic and your fighting style... you are a really great fighter, a top 3 lightweight in the world, but your striking game and movement. i can't see anything but you getting KO'd in 1 vs conor...and vs khabib...if Lee took you down that many times my lord the difference.
Man, Ariel checks his laptop too much when his guests are talking.
Lol Tony, delusional. Conor gonna kill him within 2. Lando Vannata had you doing the chicken dance and you think you can handle a combo from Conor?
I wish Condit will go into acting, the guy has something about him, I wanna see him in some movies
Im a musician of 30yrs. \n I must say Everlast's performance was VERYimportant, he grasped that and wasted nothing, he took that moment did Xactly what was needed, healing. Big respect to the man. BIG RESPECT!
Max Holloway is so butt hurt.
Lol tony is so lucky he loses weight so easy. Should be at 170 cheating realy
How beautiful to see Sharon and Charles interacting.  Thank you for this intimate glimpse into her world.
Yes! Sharon and Charles together!  Miss them both.
Bosco and the team- Thanks for making and posting this, it's a beautiful tribute. I still can't re-watch the documentary yet, I just miss this woman and her energy. This made me cry like a baby... She will live forever in the music, thanks again, can't wait to hear her final album.
Rest In Power Sharon!
I miss her so much, everyday. Sharon and Charles have left indelible marks on all of us, and the music world. I know that they are jamming up in Heaven with Prince, Tom Petty, DB and so many other musical heroes we have lost. Thank you, Daptone for this incredible video, and for producing real, powerful soul music!
This moved me in so many ways. I'm sad that Sharon and Charles are no longer with us, but their art will outlive us all and for that I am so very grateful.
I'm also writing this message with tears streaming down my face.  Glad to have had the opportunity to see Sharon last September when Miss Sharon Jones was playing in Brooklyn.  I'll always cherish that moment.  So grateful we still have her music and movie!  Great video!
Nothing but Love & Respect for Charles & Sharon R.I.P x
Brought a tear to my eye, seeing Sharon and Charles living it up, having a good time, doing what they did best..... RIP Sharon and Charles.
The Queen is back... Forever!
Man, I miss her and Charles.
The best performer I've ever seen. Still can't believe she's gone. What a beautiful song.
Maravilhosa!❤😘 I love her!
A beautiful tribute!
Sharon and Charles were taken from us much to early. Timeless soul music great performers.\nThey are missed
One of the most beautiful souls ever to grace a stage. Wherever you are Sharon, we love you; we miss you.
I'm feelin' this song
What an amazing tribute to Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings. My heart breaks for the entire band-they lost a sister in soul, and quite frankly lost their livelihood. One only has to read about the trials and tribulations the band went through when Sharon fought cancer the first time to realize if they don't tour, they make no money. Thanks to everyone downloading music or using these free services, there is precious little money in recording music and selling it.\nDo the band a favor, do Daptones records a favor, and buy 10 copies of this CD for your friends and family. There will never be a band quite like SJDK again. Bosch/Gabe, thanks for making this all happen.
Beautiful, what an amazing energy!
I'm not scared to grow old now
Sharon forever you'll stay in our hearts !
This is a lovely tribute. Bravo, Daptone.
I loved her and the great band plays with Amy too. This clip it's a dream...
Only time I got a record signed and a kiss smack on the lips to go with it! Miss you Sharon, rest well.
Even in her last days, she still full of energy. Definitely one of the best that the world ever seen
more than music Sharon Jones and Charles Bradley .... Never Forget
Not one dislike. As it should be.
I miss her every day. Thank you Daptone!
Chilling to see both Sharon and Charles together.
Thanks, Daptone!  Love and miss you, Sharon and Charles.
Sounds great!  Can't wait for it to be released!  Wow...in seeing Charles Bradley in this video.  RIP to them both!!
True Gem!
Forever Legends RIP † @2:21
Miss her.
fabulous!!
Beautiful
Loved it!
💙
oh yeah! love and miss Sharon
I STILL get goosebumps every time I hear you guys sing Crazier Than You! <3
Oliver: *cheeky assgrab at 9:14 *\nMe: *chokes on air*
does anyone not have a crush on oliver
I love seeing Carrie happy something about it just brings me joy on an otherwise bad day. My honorary big sister is killing it career wise taking on the book and theater industry it’s beautiful to see.
There's a Catan app???
Olly, you need one of the Newt Hufflepuff scarves from Fantastic Beasts. They sell them and they are much more subtle.
MORE SCOTT!!! Miss seeing his beautiful face xxx!
Hi I'm coming to see the show in a few weeks time yay
I'll be so so sad when tour is over bc I love the Adams family vlogs :(
Great video! Do you happen to have a business contact email?
Does anyone know if there are going to be any more tour dates after the Singapore trip? My sister and I wanna come see the show but we have to fly in from Holland so have to plan it because of school and vacations
My boyfriend and I had one of our first dates in that very Maggie Mays ❤️
My sister did the same thing with my birthday present. I was planning to buy some shampoo/conditioner the week before (luckily i didn't) and she got me the EXACT TWO I wanted (I love Juicy and American Cream)... even though they weren't the same as the ones i just finished. Love it when that happens :)\n\nAlso, as ever, love your videos, always put a smile on my face!
Will you guys be doing a cast recording of the show? I just saw a play of it at my college and I loved the show! I would LOVE to have the soundtrack with you in it! 💜
I will be there this Saturday at the Kings Theatre Glasgow and taking my older sister, as a treat because she is an amazing sister.  I can not wait.  Been following you on here Carrie and the time has come to see the show.  Hope you enjoy your time in Glasgow x
Saw you in the opening night at the Grand Opera House, you (and everyone else!) were awesome!!! It was my friend's first ever time at the theatre and she really, really enjoyed it :) Had to dash for a train so couldn't wait and stage door to tell you how much I enjoyed it in person, but hopefully I'll see you again in the future and can tell you then!
OMG you and Scott’s rendition of Somewhere Over The Rainbow is beautiful😄
So weird seeing you in places that are so familiar to me! Loved meeting you Carrie, you were so sweet as always
I saw you perform last night at the Kings theatre it was amazing loved the show , you were all great 💖💖
CAN NOT WAIT!! UR COMING TO ME NEXT WEEK AND IM COMING TO WATCH!!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE COME TO STAGE DOOR!!
I get the feeling that u and Oliver are dating
Are Carrie and Oliver together
Ok. I know I'm probably way behind the times, but why/when did the channel change names? I could have sworn that there was a (relatively) recent video where she talked about how she WOULDN'T change it because of the significance of the phrase It's way past your bedtime to her life. DID I DREAM THAT? AM I CRAZY?
I seriously think Carrie has the perfect voice. That is to say, if I could be Ursula and steal anyone’s voice it would be hers!💜🖤
Oliver's monkey impression looked more like Zoidberg😂
I actually went to see that in Belfast because we're doing the addams family in november \nP.s. I'm the granny \nP.s.s. I was the guy with the stupid laugh
One Normal Night is one of my fav songs from the Musical and you totally sing it the best ! wish could hear recorded version.
Absolutely loved seeing you perform! Kinda raging that I didn't bump into you at all seeing as my work is directly next the Opera house.
At the end of the tour, we need a full dance cover of crazier than you!! :D
So I watched this with my husband, and when the video ended his response was: Wait we have to wait for the Unicorn!?\nAnd now he is sad that there aren't anymore videos to watch till next week.
Now we all just wanna know what happened to the unicorn
EXCUSE ME BUT I WAS NOT READY FOR THAT BUM SQUEEZE
I've just realised that Oliver reminds me of John Barrowman and now I can't unsee it. 😫
Absolutely loved meeting you in Belfast! Hope you liked the summer night fruit tea 💕💕
I need to see the fully grown unicorn. This isn’t fair
Enjoyed this show so so much absolutely incredible!
The real question is, where on earth did that dragonfly necklace come from? it's gorgeous!
But what about the unicorn though? THE SUSPENSE IS KILLING ME!!!
Can anybody find the jumper from Zara she is wearing and link it! Im in love with it! I see you on Friday night and I CANNOT wait!!! xx
why the youtube name change? I loved it :( xx
I saw you LIVE! I was skooked to the core. your voice is seriously amazing. well done!!!
It's the elevation is my new excuse! Hahaha
When she said end of the day ... is it ok if I sang “end of the day another day over” les mis
Hey I was just wondering, how long do these musicals usually run for?
My ticket arrived last week so I’m getting more and more excited now and even have a sticker in my planner for the day 8 come to see the show. Yeah I’m a nerd lol
didn't even think to look for a catan app for my phone! Love the game. might have to go look for it now.
I actually can't cope that you are in Maggie mays like 2 minutes from my flat 🙈 seen you while you were here, me and my best friend had the best night, amazing show
Also your voice is a POWERHOUSE
you were amazing on saturday! love you xo
Ok I've always wanted to know the answer to this: HOW do actors in musicals not CONSTANTLY LOSE THEIR VOICES?!! That's so much constant stress on your voice omg
Anyone else find it hilarious that she was dressed as Wednesday talking about wanting a giant unicorn 😂😂
Scott has me wondering about his range. I had an oh snap moment when he took it up a free octaves.
But what happened with the unicorn??? 🦄🦄🦄
I saw you guys in that theatre Thursday and it was amazing! 10/10
whenever you film onstage and show all the seats it makes me so happy :) you're my inspiration, carrie ♥
I started SNORTING with laughter at 9:16 like OH MY GOD
What is the music for the signing clip?
Are her and Dan still friends??
Are.... are we sure they aren’t dating....?
Although they're in the same family, zebras make different barking sounds than horses do, so it stands to reason that unicorns would make different sounds as well.  Something more lyrical perhaps?
Forget Oliver, I want to see more of the woman with the purple headband @6:40  :D
Maybe it's just me but you seem a bit wicked dressed as Wednesday, the character takes over and nice Carrie is no more.
So nice seeing the inside of my favourite place to work in whilst I'm across the water in Liverpool for Uni.
You where wearing that necklace today as well, very cool!! Where did you get it? And whoop for the Stitch pj!!
Love “watch me, Wednesday” xx😀 now which shop did you get that beautiful green scarf from??
I must admit, after being introduced to the new cast on Sunday night at the London Poladium, I wasn't sure what to think, since watching these vlogs I've found it quite reassuring that you guys are doing a great job at taking the show on!
It's like we're inside a jewelry box! 😍 That is what it looks like!! I've always dreamed of being that little ballerina inside a music box... Carrie, you really were! 💕
so so excited for the addam's family in singapore!!!!
Oh carrie please do a full cover of somewhere over the rainbow that would be lovely
I'm loving the backstage dancing haha! So excited to see the show in Glasgow :D
I'm so upset I don't have the money to go to see The Adams Family \nI hope you have a really amazing and special time in Belfast! <3
Where is your long striped dress from please?? Xx
Can we have a full cover of one normal night pleaseeeee
I was at your last performance in Belfast on Saturday night! It was flipping amazing! \nI've never appreciated how pretty the Grand Opera House is until you pointed it out!
I was in the front row at the Thursday matinee in GOH and it was amazing. Thanks for a class show even if some of the guys in the orchestra pit got a bit singed by the rogue fuse from Festers rocket! Haha
I just booked tickets to see The Addams family in Glasgow after seeing it in Edinburgh I couldn't not see it in Glasgow!! I'm so excited
Was at the half 2 show on Saturday and loved it so so so much. Hearing crazier than you again makes me so happy!
The chemistry between you and Oliver is insane. Whether you may be together or not, you're definitely friendship goals and I envy it so much
Is the dear Evan Hansen cover (with you and Oliver) ever going to be uploaded? I NEED a full version in my life! 💕
I could watch HOURS of Carrie, Ollie, Scott, and the rest of the cast just having fun and singing their hearts out. I'm always so sad to see the vlogs end. I look forward to them every week and they always make me smile so much. Keep up the great work, Carrie! <3
That unicorn is the biggest cliffhanger...
what's the deal with the unicorn, fletcher??? the people want to know
ok but did the unicorn ever get bigger??? asking for a friend...
Love the scarves! :) <3
oliver ormson doing the most casual pirouette ever is the reason I'm an emotional mess
TRENDINGGG
YOUARESOPRETTYBEAUTIFULFUNNTANDTALENTED AAAAAA
That riff at 5:56 ❤️❤️❤️❤️
So cute
Wonderful 😍
Your voice 😍😍😍
Carrie has really nice eyebrows
All these comments are basically the same thing 😂 least Carrie has everyone's approval if she wants it 😂❤️
It’s so funny how much different English (British) language is from American language if that makes sense😂 like Carrie says Beer Mats and in America we call them Coasters 😂😂🤔
I'm so upset that you were in Belfast just weeks after I moved away for uni! 💔💔
1:32 IM NOT IMPULSIVE (I'd never ask that of you)
Can we please have a unicorn update? xx
anyone know the song at 0:25
I’ve never met someone else who knew that coaster (or beer mat as you said) flipping trick! So awesome 💕
''its like we're inside a jewellery box!'' that was so adorable :3
You feel most comfortable with your body between the age of 75 and 84? I would think that your feeling like shit because your back hurts your cranky, music sucks so your ears hurt, all this pain and anger is giving you a headache you can't pee normally anymore, like I see nothing good in all of this and it will transfer to your psychy which is the next thing saying you feel the best at 82, so with all this shit going on and the idea that your body is near its limits and you are probably gonna die soon how is my psychological well being at its highest? It's stressed as fuck
I am 12. Nothing interesting. 💩 I dont want to believe this. 😂
I haven't even finished and I know I'm going to feel down after this video D:
0-2 years old you can get away with ANYTHING
Why do they say that Math skills are highest at 50 years old but show Physics stuff instead -.-
Best at playing chess? Most people can’t even play
From the jump this video is dumb, the younger age learning languages better  thing is a myth.
Such videos need evidence. scientific evidence or at least mention a research because this world has a media that is full of mistakes
Ok I will wait to get 50 and then deal with mathematics
Cant wait to be 60 or over so I can say whatever the f I want lol
That's for middle class , what about the other humans?
Did anyone see Pogba in the last few seconds?
Im Was The Best At Skateboarding When I Was 10 Now Im 47 Still The Best At My True Sport
Women's peak strength is earlier than 25
i one year over least likely to die, *sigh*
Wait... so you're telling me I have to wait half a century in order to be decent at math... *sigh*
Or just go smoke a blunt
Anyone know who the music is by?
Women make highest salary at 39 and met at 48 wtf are the feminists talking about
I actually felt the most alive, and my future felt the most promising at 23. By the time I turned 24 though, after a few failed job interviews and rejections later.. realized this life thing aint easy.
this is the most depressing video ever
i am least likely to die :/\n*W H Y*
I haven’t begun to peak
I just want to know when will be my peak dick size.
I'm 18. I guess this is my last year of not being retarded
Age 31, when your metabolism says “fuck you”.
Lol, so you are at peace with yourself and your body just before you die.....
Does anyone know the song?
75-84 most comfortable with your body???? Are you freaking kidding me????????????
It would make my day if someone could tell me what song this is.
When you dont fit any of the above 😂😂😂
This explains why i keep getting straight F's in my math class....cant wait to get 50 and boom....
Well ain't this video all BS
Some of these don't make sense.
Yeah...just can’t wait until I can play chess well.
Yeah I'm looking forward to having great math skills. You know, 30-40 years after school
why at the end did it say there's always one thing to look forward to then they all die
Well this wasn't nearly as depressing as I thought it would be.
Even though this isn't full on fact (or fact at all) this video is uplifting to people who are scared of aging.
I call bullshit on most of them
What a load of crap.
Dnt watch this just experience ur own surprises In the things that make you, YOU ! (:
ATTENTION :\n\nThe Beast System is the Church System... All Church's,Any Denomination, They all are part of the beast system. Pastors feed sheep polluted bread so they continue to look for spiritual highs.. THE PATH IS NARROW AND VERY FEW PEOPLE FIND IT!THE STRONG DELUSION THAT GOD SENDS IS SUNDAY CHURCH SERVICE, AS WELL AS THE PRIDE OF LIFE.PEOPLE WOULD RATHER LISTEN TO THEIR PASTOR THEN LISTEN TO GOD. EVERLEARNING IN CHURCH INSTITUTIONS AND NEVER KNOWING JESUS. NEVER HEARING THE FATHER VOICE.Many People when Jesus comes are gonna say didn't we do miracles didn't we heal or cast out demons DIDNT WE ATTEND CHURCH but Jesus is gonna say depart from me I never knew you because you were told that God's Law was the Old covenant and that going to Church on Sunday is sufficient to go-to Heaven.REPENTANCE,OBEDIENCE AND LOVE ARE THE ONLY WAY TO HEAVEN. THE CHURCH SYSTEM ANY CHURCH IS A LIE. THE CHURCH IS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD THEY ARE NOT IN THE INSTITUTIONS. GOD WANTS US TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS!!! COME OUT OF CHURCH AND RELEGION AND INTO GOD'S LOVING ARMS!! ACTS 7:48\n\nBE YE SEPARATE FROM THE WORLD!! BE YE SEPERATE FROM THE LOVERS OF THIS WORLD!
Highest satisfaction in life 23? Well, the rest of life is going to suck haha.
But I thought no one likes you when you're 23?
I'm 18 and i noticed I'm faster at reading and reflexes this year compared to other years no joke. Lol.
PLEASE SUBSCRIBE MY CHANNEL CLICK THIS LINK -> www.youtube.com/channel/UCKSD1NHl06lQkEjtieAcACg  SUBSCRIBE IS FREE
Great....Ill die before the things I need happen lol
Did the really do women are most attractive and not do men are most attractive?
What are you the best at RIGHT NOW? \n.... sleeping.
They forgot:\nThe age when you are best at popping a boner: 12 years old
So these are just averages, you can’t really take anything from this video, at all
Well, damn, I'm 24 so I guess it's all downhill now.
Highest satisfaction at 23? That was the lowest point of my life.
Age is just a number or you can  ask my mom, who against all odds , came to this country, learn a new language at 44, met the man of her dreams at 46, got an incredible job offer at 66, at 77 yrs old my mom is still going strong!!\nstill works her full time job ( by choice), and has More aspirations than ever.\nabove all she is very grateful woman for what she  has done for  her life  and ours .\nage is just a number.
lmao the happiest is 23 years old, usually when people graduate college
I thought at the end it was going to say No matter how old you are...we are all going to die
Jesus goddamn Christ! Can I go one day without worrying about my future?!
No matter how old you are... remember, that one day, you WILL die.  Have a nice life :)
Well this brought my self esteem down
What if I say, I don't believe this crap ....
Quality of life is highest at 23? I feel like there are so many social determinants and lifestyle dependency factors...
You Are Great - Motivation \nhttps://youtu.be/4R90ek4V7d8
This is fake I enjoyed life the most when I was 24
 I'm Proven this video Very Wrong !     🔮
23 is typically when most people are out of college with no job.  That doesn't sound like a satisfying life.
Going back to college at 50 I guess
Bunch Of Nonsense
Nothing
This is BS
Brain activity fastest at 18. Well fuck 😂
wtf is this based on ? buzzfeed polls ?
All BS
That shit’s bullshit
0:42 BOII!!
Horrible
23 most happiest lmfao
Nothing
bullshit
So after 30 eat shit
All downhill from 25
Sources?
wtf was taht
42
FALSE.
lockheed martin
Not true
FUCK MY LIFE
Peak procrastination age - 15 to 20
Nice music
Anout to be 25 💪💪💪💪
Yup, we can all look forward to death!
This video is complete bullshit.
Oh yeah?....., well whats the age you get a shitty roll of the dice and get cancer and die well before most people?.... \n\nFuck off!
I'm 19, time to see how shitty the rest off my life will be :)
When are men most attractive to women? Da fuk.
TIL that the average person, doesn't know what an average means...
so they looked at a bunch of statistics, calculated averages and then proceeded to make a shitty, useless video. bravo.
Get this trash off trending!!!!
Who makes such stupid videos?
Hello, my name is Jinny Anna. I am 14 years old and I want to ask everyone a question. How can a young ugly girl become a youtuber? 😭
Love this Georgia! Would love a style/ look book style video! Or history or your style, fashion tips x
Really good video and enjoyed watching it
Nice video thanks for sharing. please visit my channel for more videos like this.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW6xNtP6pnfXXXXp7cvSTOw
You are so lovely and natural in your videos its so refreshing!! I don't wear red...oh wait, i've got red on!! 😂😂😂
It's so lovely to watch your pregnancy journey. Love the pink and white t-shirt  I would totally wear that and I'm not pregnant lol
Loved this!! How long have you got now till Bump is a Baby? Bet you're excited!!!😁😁
I loved this shirt u using. I would totally wear it too 😍
Hi Georgia! Loving the videos!! 😍 I was just wondering if you could tell me where you got your big candle holder in the background please?! It’d be perfect in my living room!! 🙊😆👏🏻 xx
Would totally be racing back to primark to pick up those pj bottoms but I already did my primark haul for the month, I think my bank would hate me!
I absolutely love this!!! Specially when you realised you're wearing red hahaha you're great and so lovely!!
It would of been lovely if you tried the things on to show us what they look like and what you would pair them with xxx but still an amazing video ❤️❤️❤️
So glad to see Primark is in there I work for the company! Also so glad your s down to earth gal that always go for designer!! Well done Georgia on such a fabulous video , loving your bump xx
Lovely :)
Where is danny
😍😍😍😍😙😙😙😙 Great video
i loved that you went to all different stores and not just high end shops. as mums cant afford expensive things!! i lived in my over the bump leggings. soo comfy and kept bump warm as it always felt cold 💕
Think primark and h&m do super long cami tops...primark do ones that are almost dress length, they are amazing for under shorter top
This is great to see! My bump has just started to pop out so I've been picking up a few bits of maternity wear but great to see some non maternity that will also work for bump! I've found there is a lack of maternity jumpers about so thanks for showing those especially!
Haha, you won't want to give your maternity jeans up, I had to put mine in the bin so I'd stop wearing them... they're so comfy! Xx
Great video Georgia - I just got the same red / tan M&S jumper a few days ago - already worn it twice! 👌🏻
Most fashionable pregnant woman I've seen! 💕
No stalker Danny since the last sighting..
Lovely remember to always do 'try on' as well. We are all curious how you look wearing these ;)
I love Primark!There are always so many lovely things to buy for yourself or your home!M&S do lovely Danish pastries and cakes which I am rather partial to,have you tried them?I am loving all your vlogs!Love the top you are wearing too!
Hiiiiiii there! 😄 Hope you're all doing well!! Today we're making some super kawaii Pusheen Brownie Pops YAY! Perfect if you don't have the time to individually roll out cake pops 😊 Enjoy!!\n\nP.S.

What’s the name of the song?😜🤔
Tip: if you change the background music it won't be that distracting \nLove you
I imagine this conversation at my birthday part\nMe: Hi guys! Guess what we are going eat.\nPerson: cake? \nMe: guess again.\nPerson: more cake? \nMe: nope. \nPerson: I am out of guesses \nMe: WE ARE GOING TO EAT PUSHEEN!!!\nPerson: but I am a vegetarian .-. I am crying inside

agree in everything you said, Great movie.
Reminded me too of Enter The Void... just totally out of this world. I hope we get another one.
my favorite scene was with Deckard's Partner, and when he folded the sheep, a cool reference to both the first movie and the book Do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep?
Please God let his Dune project be successful
I disagree with just about everything you said in this video. It was in no way a masterpiece to give a 10/10 rating for this 6/10 movie is crazy
watch this movie you will love it         ¨Dave Maze¨\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzikIwPPle0&t=69s
This movie is so good!
Knew this would be good as soon as I saw who director was. Like I believe Adam has said before, you can tell more about wheter or not a movie will be good by the director, than anything else. A film can have a great cast, and be crap, if the director is crap. But take a great director like Dennis Villanueve, and there is a good chance you will get a great film. Not to say great directors can't make bad films, but a great director has a higher sucess rate than a great actor
Just watched this movie i am definitely going to watch it again
no one wants another jurassic anything at this point
10/10 for me. Go see this!!
Everything you just said was exactly my thoughts on the film after watching it for the first time last night.  I've seen Blade Runner more times than I can count or remember and when I read they were doing a sequel in a EW mag, I was extremely skeptical (even knowing Denis was slated as director and I already seen Prisoners and loved it) but then I go in and have one of the greatest fan and film experiences of my life.  Blade Runner 2049 is everything that any fan could ever hope to have in a sequel, even when that sequel comes out 30 years after the original.  It was a huge risk to make this kind of film in today's media and I say they pulled it off in a practically perfect way.
Damn, when Adum wants to give a movie a 10/10, for all that it's worth, it must be a near perfect movie!
i think this is the best movie of the year lol 10/10
Well its bombing in the box office so we wont get more good movies anymore this is why we cant have good things good job everyone go give Marvel all your money to see a movie you've already seen ten times already but just with a characyer swap
Basically I feel that any movie that Adam likes. Is going to do bad in box office sales\nThanks for fucking shit up Adam
What was Wallace's motivation for being evil and why was it in conflict with Gosling's? Srsly didn't get that.
I cant understand for the life of me why people are praising this movie so much. Even people like YMS and cinema for cynics who normally are picky about movies. This movie had terrible pacing, convoluted story telling, and wooden under developed characters. The bad guys were soooo one dimensional and stupid. Doesn't hold a candle to the original.
Watched this the other day and loved it!  Literally my only complaint was there was a lot of moments i nearly lost my hearing ( obviously exaggerating ) but that was more the cinemas issue. 10/10
Vote with your wallets is the gist of this video, in my opinion. Please start supporting great movies like Blade Runner 2049, instead of shitty blockbusters, otherwise shitty blockbusters are all we're going to be getting from now on.
It's a Ghostbusters(2016) of sci-fi movies. You guys take too much drugs.
So are we getting more pokemon vids?
This movie failing at the box office may be a great thing. Now there won't be a cinematic universe and unnecessary sequels
I know it’s really broad to say, but for me, this might be the greatest film of the decade
Kinda weird not hearing that split second earrape intro like with the rest of your videos
Just saw it myself and really enjoyed it. \nHowever, without spoiling anything, there was a scene that took me by surprise because it suddenly reminded me of a scene from the movie Ghost and I had to stifle a chuckle in the theater.
Apparently he's interested in making his own version of Dune\n*Claps then shoots arms up in excitement*
It avoided all of the traps of your usual sequel cash-grab.
It's is incredibly relieving to me that you enjoyed this film.  I felt the same way as you after my second viewing.
I need that Denis Dune movie in my life.
Looks like people voted to have more Jurassic worlds and Transformers. ☹
Do i have to watch all the 2048 blade runner movies?
Story was fucking awful. Littered with conveniences. Forgets a lot of the elements it brings up and doesn't do anything with it's themes. The ties to the original were pointless.
I kinda hated it honestly. I felt bored during the movie.
I've seen this movie 2 times already and I will be seeing it again can't get it out of my head.
It's such a shame that a visionary film like this under performs at the box office, while bullshit movies like the Transformers sequels still rake in enough cash to keep being made. WTF!?
Fake Reviews are propping this disaster up\n \nThis movie was just awful in so many ways. I had a very hard time\nstaying awake and an even harder time making sense out the extremely\nslow story line unfolding. I kept thinking the entire time I was\nwatching it that they were just filling time with empty, meaningless\nscenes. In the end I was convinced that the entire story could have\nbeen told in about thirty minutes, with some decent action, and it\nwould have been a lot better. \n\nThe main way to describe this movie is that, to be kind, the story line\ntook a backseat to meaningless but beautiful HD cinematography. The\nstory was difficult to follow and had an all over the place and\nmeaningless feeling to it. No one in the theater said a word when it\nwas over. They all just got up and walked out looking bored out of\ntheir minds. \n\nCharacter development was next to non existent with the exception of a\nfew scenes that pretended to develop the main character. \n\nSince I had to give it one star to rate it, I will say that star was\nfor the actors, who in my opinion did as good a job as possible with\nthe horrible, painstakingly slow script they were give. \n\nMy last complaint is that I have been duped into going and seeing a few\nmovies because the IMDb rating was initially very high, only to end up\nwasting my time and money. I am convinced that the good reviews are\nfake and most likely paid for. It is IMPOSSIBLE for people to be rating\nthis garbage a 9 or 10. Perhaps someone who is deaf and just loves\nlooking at HD scenery in movies would have loved it. Other than that it\nwould take a seriously unique kind of person to think this movie was\ndecent, much less good.
Will you please please please do a review on 'American Satan' when it comes out. I'm positive it's gunna suck but I'd like to hear your thoughts on it and if it's worth my time.
I'm so glad you loved this movie as much as I did, it's definitely my favourite movie of 2017
I loved the movie. The art and cinematography is amazing. But I do believe it's a bit stretched out. Lots of just waiting around, a bit too long to concentrate on (maybe because I saw it at 10pm and was tired.)
If this guy pulls off a successful DOOM movie I think my faith in this medium will be restored.
Harrison Ford was perfect in episode seven. For what it was supposed to be. It wasn't eh, it was Han. It's probably one of the reasons Ford really doesn't like that character, because he has to act somewhat cheesy and at times kind of stupid. His performance in Crystal Skull was eh.
From an audio/visual perspective this movie is the apex of what film has done so far.
ADAM IM UPSET BLADE RUNNER ISNT DOING GOOD AT THE BOX OFFICE IM GOING TO WATCH IT 3 MORE TIMES
I recently watched Arrival for the first time and I can say with absolute certainty that Denis Villeneuve is the best new filmmaker working today. I didn't think I'd be saying that but after watching Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario and now, Arrival, there's no doubt in my mind. Arrival was smart, emotional and spellbinding and did something that is rare in mainstream movies; It provoked my thoughts. I can't wait to see Blade Runner 2049.
Funny I found the first one much more enjoyable and better paced than the new one. I actually had moments where I had to keep me awake in the cinema because I was nearly falling asleep because it was not only long but so slow paced like every scene. Even now that I am nearly complettly asleep I have trouble turning of the original but just one hour ago I ad real trouble not to fall asleep. Also the characters where much better. Especially this, whats his face? The guy who bought tyrell just sucked and I was happy when he was out of frame. He was okay but damn Tyrell was a genius this is just a Chickenhead of a rich dude.\n\nBut than that is how it is everyone expierence so I see YMS points and I consider them fair.
Maybe the engineers from Prometheus / Alien Covenant are replicants that created the aliens so that replicants could kill off all humans.
I nearly didn't see this on the basis that I didn't like the original Blade Runner, but the overwhelmingly positive reviews I've read/heard from reviewers and publications I trust and close friends swayed my opinion. So glad I did. Sure, there WERE flaws, but they didn't massively detract from the film, and honestly, if it doesn't sweep all the techie awards (Oscars, BAFTAs, etc. etc.), I will slap a bitch.
Do a yms review of screenagers
I've never heard him say 10/10
Lets give this director more money plz!!! Villenueve deserves it. His worlk has been impecable on every single movie he has been directing. Personally one of my favorites this decade.
Thank you Adam, I was going to skip this one because I wasn't convinced Blade Runner needed a sequel or that Hollywood would do it justice but this quickie made me do a 180 on that decision.\nWas not disappointed in the least!
not a 10/10 I'm so fucking triggered reeeeee!
m8! do a review on IT pleez
I'm gonna see it again over the weekend. It's an experience but I feel like I wanna explore the universe more. First watch,I'd say maybe a 9.1/10. 
I really hope Villeneuve and Deakins squeeze in Bond 25 before Dune
Spoilers:\nI think the whole movie is about K finding his humanity. Throughout the movie, he constantly is belittled by everyone for being a replicant, he’s not real to anyone, not even to himself. But deep down, he knows there's something more, but because of his job and the world he lives in, he won't accept it. That’s why his girlfriend isn’t real either, he doesn't think he deserves a real one, and he See's himself in her. But as the story continues, and he begins to figure out that he may actually be this prophecy child, he begins to realize that maybe he is real. He starts breaking down, realizing that this whole time he was right, that what his girlfriend told him was right, that he is special. Because of this he begins acting human, he goes against what he's told, he lies, as he believes he really is real, that he has a soul. But after its revealed to him that he isn't this child, he loses hope. They tell him to kill deckard, and begins to act as he did at the beginning of the film, just following orders. But before he does, he See's his girlfriend advertising hologram, and then realizes something. He realizes this whole time, she was just as unreal as he was. But he loved her just the same. So it hits him, if I can believe she is real, why can't I believe I am real? He realizes that this whole time, he always had a soul, that everything he did while he thought he was this child the way he acted, that was just him. The memory of the horse was like placebo for him. You even hear the voice over say dying for a cause is the most human thing a person can do  which is exactly what he did. But this not only alludes to him, but to Joi too. She risked her life to help him, and died because of it. In this scene, he realizes that she was real. Him realizing she is real, is his miracle (like sapper said) that gives him a reason to believe he too is real. He then uses this freedom to go against what he is told, freeing deckard, reuniting him with his daughter, and then dying peacefully just like Roy. As he has now proven to himself. That he was always real. As he lets the snow land on him, just like the rain did on Joi when she discovered she was real. He is real. He is free.
huh. i watched this expecting you to rip it a new asshole not suck it off. I guess i need to see it.
I thought it was boring. Although I enjoyed when he choked that bitch out.
dune aside, I heard daniel craig absolutely wants villeneuve to direct his final 007 next year...
2049 is not a movie, seeing it in a theater is one of those experiences you describe to your grandchildren years later.
When i saw that you'd reviewed BR49 i was excited and a little worried because your reviews are usually spot on and you don't suffer fools gladly so i was pleasantly surprised with your very positive review. \nI watched BR as a 20yo and it really was my favourite movie for many years (not so much these days). It's so nice to see that the torch has been passed.
this movie costed $150m let's hope it'll surpass it's budget.
I knew I wanted to see this movie, but I so rarely see movies (just due to scheduling). This review was the kick in the ass I needed and holy shit, I loved it. Possibly one of my favorite movies of the past few years. Excellent.
Well I guess we gotta give Ridley Scott credit...
I completely agree. I loved this movie and do think it is an improvement over the original. I felt transported to another universe for 3 hours, and the story was decadent filled with characters that are well acted and that the audience grows to actually care about.
I love the theme of loneliness in the movie.
Oscar MUST consider this film during awards season. Reframed in that context I think it will finally attract the audience it was always meant to (i.e. people looking for long form art, not a blockbuster action film).
wtf, this review was the most positive review ive ever heard from Adam. So much so that I thought he had to be kidding. I'll definitely check this movie out
Oh fuck I didn't know the person who directed Arrival.\nI'll watch this.
Instead of doing DOOM maybe the director who's name I will not butcher can explore a possible live action Cowboy Bebop?? =D
Oh my god, a movie that Chris Stuckmann and YMS agree on? Amazing. The only, ONLY reviewer or whatever that didn't like this movie was Cr1tikal and his opinion just comes from his lack of understanding of what Blade Runner is. His friend didn't even like the shining. Everyone else is in love. If even YMS is in love, then this really is one of the best sequels of all time. Alongside Aliens.
Too bad it couldn't captivate audiences enough to see it... like the original couldn't...
9? Wow, the movie rubbed me in the wrong way for some reason, I would not give it more than a 6 or 7. Maybe an 8. I also watched the first Bladerunner a day before, and it left a better impression on me than the new one. The new one has some similar visual elements, but in my mind the new movie has a different tone than the first one. The first one from what I got out of it was about the struggle of a lower class. I feel that the new one has some themes that are better illustrated in Children of Men, and Moon, with regards to a rare birth and memory implants. The first movie was much more subtle, and better developed than the new one in my opinion. I wouldn't say that the new one sucks, but rather it is a sort of fancy average.
I saw this video the day it came out, watched the first five seconds, heard I thought it was phenominal and immediately closed the video to go watch the film. After finally getting a chance, I came back, watched the vid, and found myself in agreeance.  A lot of the things you said were things I happened to notice while watching the movie. You and other film critic channels (such as Ralphthemoviemaker) have really helped me learn about how cinematography works, and how to view films with a critical eye rather than that of the average movie goer. In many ways this has enhanced my experience watching films and I appreciate the lessons you've taught on the value of good film making.
Could you please do a more in depth review of this movie. Would love to hear your opinions on the plot, wich was my biggest gripe with the film. I may just be stupid, but some things were quite confusing to me.
The one sequel, the ONE good sequel, and it tanks harder than the Cleveland Browns. Yippee.
I just saw this movie today. The theater was mostly empty unfortunately, but it's so good I decided I'm gonna have to see it at least two more times. I want more movies like this, please.
If u like a movie just dont make a vid bout it
Someone who actually gives Leto his due how about that.
m gonna have to completely disagree with you about the pacing.  It felt like 7 hrs for me.
I hope Denis gets Dune green lit.
I thought it was pretty good, bit slow and the rebellion plot was a bit unnecessary though
visually one the best movies iv ever seen, highly recommend seeing this in cinemas the sound made me feel like I was in a trance
I saw this movie and fell in love with it. I saw that you were reviewing it and my heart sank into my stomach. I respect and am heavy influenced by your reviews, but I was thinking “Please, Adam, go easy on this movie”. I am very happy you enjoyed it too.
K I N O
Blade Runner is a great film, as is the sequel, which is an extremely rare thing...   but alas, I'm heartbroken. It seems that the general public HAS voted with their wallets and Blade Runner 2049 is not the film they want. They don't want excellent pacing, cinematography, directing, acting, etc. Most want their Fast & Furious and Transformer schlock. If there is one thing I want to see happen (which probably won't) is that even if it's not the financial success we'd hoped it would be, I pray The Academy gets one thing right, and that's for 2049 to sweep all it's categories...          well, if it's even nominated, that is.
Every time Ryan Gosling's wife rang, the Peter and the Wolf ringtone made me immediately paint a mental image of Kenny initiating a plan to beat Spenny at a competition.
so this is what happens when a director who wants to say something gets an opportunity in 2017. I hope that people will support this with their $. denis villeneuve will never be unemployed anyways, but let's show that we, as general audience still have a good taste.
so fucking\n\n\nboring
You kinda sound like riley dennis
bullshit. director is talentless cockroach, eh.
ngl, didnt like it
Vote with your wallets, people
42nd on trending \n\n\n\n\nGOOD JOB
Wtf is episode 7?
Adam this comment is kinda gay but I just wanted to say that I love this channel. Your reviews are hilarious and aside from just being funny these videos are pretty in depth and analytical all things considered. I just wanted to say this channel is fucking great and coming from someone who aspires to be a director  I really admire what you do. so keep up the good work and remember cool cat loves you.
I'm sorry, how was every scene necessary? There's legit a whole scene of him sticking his hand in a beehive for 10 mins. He just walks around doing nothing for most of the film.\n\nI actually thought you were being sarcastic at points. This movie was so long and the plot was so thin it should have been an hour long.\n\nThe story was really predictable and kind of disappointing. Compare this to an episode of black mirror and there's no contest. Blade Runner 2049 wasn't thrilling, it wasn't exciting. It was mildly interesting at best.\n\nThe type of movie is also done to death with Ghost In The Shell and every dystopian sci-fi franchise ever being already produced. \n\nIt has no suspense or drama and it had a typical mustache twirling villain that drove the plot of the film. I wouldn't even call it dystopian, the drive of the film had nothing to do with the world. The world wasn't oppressive and the protagonist wasn't fighting against human nature, he was fighting against some big baddy. \n\nI also had no reason to care about the characters. I just found myself thinking, oh so they're dead okay.\n\nAny other sci-fi film has explored the concepts in this film a million times better than this did.\n\nIdk, maybe I should watch it again but idk why people are praising this film so much.
This movie was so fucking boring...
It was bloody awful, dry, slow and anti climatic. I agree the cinematography and visuals with the locations and props was excellent, but everything else was below par.
He fills each word of the song with so much emotion. I did a cover of this song on my channel in case anyone is interested!
White man with a black man's voice. 😂😂
Guess he's free to steal Tom Petty songs now....
Seems like he did eat his CD , it sound exactly like the audio version
Friend.  Why is he dressed like a dad that sneaks out to secretly sing at night?
He reacts like me after a song and people clap. Only difference is he performs for millions of people and I play at birthday parties and weddings. well actually I play alot of styles but whatever. thats not my point. He's workin it.
Best SNL performance in a really long time!
Spot on...his voice hits a nerve..gives me chills...it resonates with me in a way i can't describe.
Ok, so Sam is amazing, but what about the three backup singers? they sounded exactly like the studio version
WOW is trensformation of losing weight make  him look like a different person
such a beautiful talented human.
He's so pure and genuine, his smile is truest
what a talented and precious little bean
what wrong with his enunciation of the letter s .stop shiching little bird
such a talent, and such a gentle soul, love him ! Awesome song and singing
It literally sounds NO different from the studio version😯
He sounds live better than the most singers with super hyper autotune !!!! 😍
his voice plus the back singers 🙌🙌
Please watch my exclusive vocal cover of this song https://youtu.be/Mm8aB0P8Xas
Ugh. My heart is melting. Wow!

Cause every time I open up, it hurts !
Proof positive that nothing will ever replace solid lyrics and a phenomenal voice singing them!!!! WaaaayTaGo Sam!!!
I love you and your music
This is the required level
You’re clearly still my fav’ singer ever 😍😍😍
Now that he lost a little weight he looks like olly alexander from years and years🤔🤔
My love he’s so cute
his voice is amazing. You know how some artist don't sound too good singing LIVE but Sam Smith sounds amazing. omg
ya'll be talking bout sam but here i am loving gal gadot's introduction!!!
omg the most perfect live version 😍
I never thought Mr. Bean sings very well
Wow man he sounds same as in his song...
This bought me to tears.
Imagine a duet between him and Adele 😩 fuccccck.
he sang very well💋❤
exactly same with the studio version maybe even better.
Guy has such a great voice! The video looks great on the S8+ too.
Omg...he lost so much weight!...looking good either way...we luv you.
i dont know this guy before but since i chatting with him  i know already....i think he is nice guy and the music is very nice...hmmm it's wonderful music
What happened to your hair
His voice is amazing plus he is adorable! 💕
i came to sing but then i realize i couldn't hear him any more.
God I love him so much❤️
Honestly fighting back tears. I am so happy Sam Smith is back. I am going to sound so clique but you really really did help me through my darkest. My brother was dying, I was an alcoholic, relationship issues, all of this made it really easy to want to drive myself in the lake. But I didn't because Sam would be on repeat until I became hoarse. \nYou look wonderful Sam. Thank you so much for your gifts. You do make a difference.
Did she say sem smit.? Not to my taste.
Stunning. Perfect. How he's progressed from the shy, static singer of three years ago. He moves with energy, 'owns' the stage., connects with the audience, smiles with confidence. His technique is perfect - wearing a tucked in shirt you can see how Sam breathes from deep in his stomach, so high notes are effortless. And his voice is now so powerful; overwhelming. Just dazzling, Sam. I love you to bits.
He's so wonderful imma cry
Sam, You're good at goodbyes, but even better at singing
That finger snapping though 😉
Holy shitue this is hellah good tho!
Can I make a song with u
Angelic voice and infectious emotion
Slay me Sam. SLAY. ME.

I stand behind what I said about this movie, which is that I hated it. You don’t have to like a movie to do a tutorial on a look from it, & being that it’s the most popular movie right now, it would be dumb of me to not do a tutorial. Get over it 🎈
Ok five minutes in and this is already awful stay tuned for updates
james has a right to do a makeup look for this even if he didn't like the movie. youtube and beauty blogging is a BUSINESS. you capitalize on what's popular. also, i GUARANTEE that some of the beauty bloggers doing IT looks didnt see the movie AT ALL. why aren't you dragging them?\n\nalso, it's not disrespecting the film to say you didn't like it but still do a tutorial. people are allowed their opinions on movies jfc. (and yeah, to all you people saying it't not just a movie blehhh... i get it. i'm literally a filmmaker.) but also...it's just a movie. not everyone's gonna like it.
Who are these Finn and Wyatt people are commenting about?
You look so beautiful   I a m c r  y i n g
bitch why! don't! just stop! stop! why! you don't f*ck with the IT fandom! your joking! your killing every one in the fandom! oh my god
Thank god you're not an actor cringey intro.
You don't have to like the movie to do a tutorial on it . Either relax or don't watch it simple 🖕 Love you James ❤️❤️❤️
You do not need to post everywhere that you hated the movie. keep it to yourself and just remember the amount of work that was put into the movie.
I get he doesn't like the movie but why? Also talk SLOWER, chill the fuck out and don't talk like your life depends on it. I don't like him at all but he is talented..
Why does he get so much hate?
How many brain cells did I lose today
“So they don’t look crusty and gross.” 😂😂
does he always talk like he has a  bubble in his throat
He should've put silver glitter in the cut crease😭😫😫
You don't even like this movie. You're just doing this for attention.
I Cant stop staring at his eyes!!
WTF YOU SAID YOU HATED THE MOVIE THEN FUCKING MADE THIS TO GET MONEY FUCK YOU GET A LIFE
am I the only one who's here because if Wyatt? like he dragged James
Omg you are so talented and flawless at makeup! Slay James x
I literally know he’s a wannabe Joey
You're doing it for attention and views because it's trending? Hm
finn dragged you in the sewer and bit your arm off boy!!!!!
ok 5 mins into the tutorial and it’s already awful, stay tuned for updates. 🎈
It's a really cool makeup tutorial but I wouldn't do it at home because I don't have all those supplies:-(but that's really cool! Hope everybody gets scared on Halloween if you  do that makeup tutorial again!!
I’m not a huge fan of James but this makeup tutorial is my actual life oml
5 minutes in and IT's already terrible stay tuned for updates
Mykie/ Glam and Gore did this week’s ago.
What is even wrong with you? You decide to hate a movie and do a makeup tutorial on a character?! You are nothing but a hypocrite picking on this wonderful talented cast and crew who have a lot of talent and work hard 😓 BUT YOU!! you're just desperate for money and decide to do this and that's so immature of you to pick fights with 14 year olds THINK BEFORE YOU ACT!!!! 😡😡😡I hope you get dragged by Jack Dylan grazer, Chosen Jacobs and Sophia lillis next GET READY FOR HENRY BOWERS TO GET YOU 👿😈👊🏼 You will and always be a hypocrite who just wants more views to get more money.
All of his makeup looks make him look like penny wise
Even the kids from it hated this.\nYou said you hated the movie then basically did this for views.
Don't know whether to roast you or compliment you...
Just read 6 articles about all the shade being thrown...I mean I love James but they owned u .... Btw only being done for the views
This is the most hypocritical ironic video of 2017 so far.
You're only doing it for views and popularity. I hope your hypocritical crusty ass gets dragged some more and maybe literally dragged to the drains SisTEr.
Don't mess with The Losers club penny Bitch
Wait I thought there was need between Shane Dawson James and the original Pennywise guy. Why?
its really sad that people forced him to apologize for not liking the movie... people can't have their own opinions? jeez...
He closes his eyes a lot
“I hate this movie, but let me exploit it and get adsense”
IN THE SHADE TACO
im only here bc of the twitter drama
What The Fvck Is 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nI Wana Kill My Self
The look is super nice I love it it is bomb
Ok James I see you get that coin. 👍🏽 it's all about business.
Sister your makeup skills are goals
The trailer already scared the shit out of me...
What the hell, why are people pressed that he said he hated the movie lmao. Y’all acting like you’ve never said a movie sucked before. A lot of youtubers make videos recommended by fans. He’s not gonna be like “ew no guys I’m not making that video because the movie sucked!” I’m convinced people love to hate on this guy for no damn reason.
How can you hate the movie!?!? I mean Eddie had two Fannie Packs! Not one but two! I mean it was so good! I just loved it so much! I mean I understand we all have opinions, so there is mine I think that IT was the best movie ever! Not to mention I am very mad I haft to wait 27 years for the next one!
@all the haters stop hating . Yes he did not like the movie it doesn’t mean he can’t please his subscribers with a requested video. And I personally am a huge fan of IT but it didn’t upset me . Everyone is entitled to their own opinions.
omg can you stop
Float float , bitch .🎈
Low-key scarier than Pennywise

You’re so self centered omg
Haha you got dragged by Wyatt Oleff
YOU'RE TRASH TOO
girl bye
I use Mary Kay day solution and it’s spf 35. I mix it with my moisturizer and it’s AWESOME!!!
I was literally saying to myself, I wish Jackie had a tutorial on sunscreen for dark skin. Then this happened. #Queen
LMFAO this video had me laughing so much. they just clock out early, you kill me, Jackie. 😂
About a week ago! *dab*
Girl... What do you use to slay your edges?
how do you reapply sunscreen over a full face of makeup? i know you have to reapply every two hours and i bought a setting mist from supergoop with spf but it sUcked so there goes that. so yeah, any tips would be appreciated
Honestly these are so overpriced. I only use Korean SPF products at this point because it's so much cheaper and basically the same quality. They take their skin protection seriously!
jackie bitch you literally have me fucking crying oh my god
Do you use sunscreen on your body every day too? And if so, do you use it everywhere or just exposed areas?
Every sunscreen I use breaks me out so bad. I just gave up lol
I'm glad somebody is talking about products that ball up after and during application. I've gotten this with a lot of moisturizers.
Your head wrap is hella cute! Give us a Tutoria!!!  Please ☺️
My friend is really pale there's a big difference when she wears spf 30, 50 and 100.
Jackie's little intro song is the only one on youtube I enjoy lol
THANK YOU. my friend never uses sunscreen bc she said she’s black she doesn’t need it and I’m like girllll, it’s not just to prevent sun burn 😭
I have worn sunscreen everyday, non-negotiable since I was 12. The way my hyper pigmentation and acne scars are set up I can't take the chance of going without it. Currently swear by the Elta Md spf 46 which my latest dermatologist highly recommends.
i saw you mention the benefit dream screen sunscreen in a video like a year + i bought it like a week afterward + ive been wearing it ever since! u know that i always listen to aunt jackie lol
Hi Jackie. I’ve been using sunscreen since I was 16 and I’m now 28. You should try Supergoop “Refresh Setting Mist Broad Spectum SPF 50”. I’ve used it for a year now and love it. I use mine mid-day after my morning SPF degrades. It’s great because the sprayer prevents you from having to rub in pollutants and makeup when reapplying SPF AND the magnifying is THE TRUTH!!!!!!
When you said, Did you forget I was Black or I about FELL OUT 😂 You are amazing.
The coverfx packaging is TRASH!!! I’ve returned a few of them to Sephora!!!
the thick formula of sunscreen makes me breakout ;( so I only wear BB/CCcreams with spf
So happy you made this, but is it just me or is the link to the chemical ingredients of sunscreen not in the description box? I really wanna know which to avoid and such.
If you want inexpensive but AWESOME SPF options, order some Korean or Japanese ones from Amazon. A lot are clear/gel formulas so you won't have a white cast.
I never miss a Jackie Video, this is what I watch in the morning when I work out.
Needed this !!!! Thank you xx
Well just snatch my edges why don't you Jackie!!💗you're the best! I so 💘 you!!
I love you jackie😂😂😂 I've been telling my fellow melanin sister's to use sunscreen  for years and I always get the side eye. Look after your skin people coconut oil is not a viable sunscreen🙄
Thank you sooooo much for this video Jackie!!! The only sunscreen I’ve ever used that didn’t cause the chalkboard look is Hawaiian Tropic sheer touch.
Auntie Jackie please review the cats pajama's palette by Laura lee. It seems very suspicious to me that I haven't seen a single negative review on it. She also seems to have only sent the palette to her close friends and really small YouTube accounts that wouldn't dare give it a negative review since they  would probably like to get on other pr lists. Idk it just seems suspicious since the searches don't seem very good and even the looks don't seem that good but the people who have tried rave about it. I need a trustworthy person aka auntie Jackie to review it
I always find myself going back to murad invisiblur but good lordt it is pricey
Woowww let me take my notes while watching this vid. this was so helpful!
Aunty Jackie 😩😩😩why wasn’t this done before the summer started 😩😭sis this could’ve been SOO useful 😭
Please review E.L.F new products. There's so many I'm interested in but afraid to buy.
Thank you, thank you, thank you for this video!!! My mom unfortunately passed away from skin cancer and she was always SO careful in the sun. You are absolutely right, cancer doesn't discriminate. I really appreciate the work you put into this! So much love! 😙
I like the missha suncreams since they have high spf levels, don’t break the bank, and are a combination of a physical and chemical suncream
My favorite daily sunscreen + moisturizer is Formula 10.0.6 Picture Perfect Day! It's only SPF 15 but it smells good and feels great! It doesn't make me greasy either.
thanks for this helpful and important video! dark skin people don't need spf is the dumbest skin care myth ever and i still see people perpetuating that ignorance in 2017. just because our skin doesn't turn red & peel off from going outside to check the mailbox (like white ppl) doesn't mean we're immune from UV rays!!
She's a veteran but she's also not trying to break a nail - why I love Jackie 😍😂
This video was a gooodseeend thankyousomuch!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
also do you have lash extensions or are you just that blessed? i'm in love with your lashes ♥
As far as the cast tacha causes. I'm a medium light skin tone. And that type of SPF makes my skin look weird too. So I think that type does that to everyone...  except maybe porcelain skin lol
Tip to all: You might want to take a daily vitamin D supplement if you're wearing sunscreen everyday. It's easy to become deficient in this vitamin if you're minimizing all sun exposure, especially for darker skinned people. Sunscreen is so, so important for everybody though.\n\nThanks for this video Jackie, I need some of that bad and  bougie Murad sunscreen in my life now.
OMG my friends and I used to send each other the Big Miss Steak picture all the time when we were in high school 😭 I miss them aw
Thanks for doing this Jackie!
I loved this video!!!! So so so informative and I really learned a lot.
La roche posay are famous for their sunscreens in Europe. It is a French pharmacy brand. Maybe worth trying out for some drugtore sunscreens?
Jackie Jackie Jackieeeee Living for the outfit Jackie!
guys just bash your head on the keyboard and see what comes up:\n\n\njackiejackieeekaklciiijackiieeejackiieeep[0\nicfhiodfikdddpio
Have you tried the Anessa perfect UV sunscreen aqua booster? It's great at mattefying :)
So do you moisturize, and then use spf or do you skip moisturizer?
I just learned there was a difference the other day in esthetics school. I need physical SPF, or I'll have to visit the ER.
i fucking love you
Wtf I thought the glossier sunscreen was soo much bigger, it looks so tiny irl when u hold it
Loving the new intro 😭
when you're as white as that tatcha sunscreen but is still watching
I get rid of my Hyperpigmentation by using potatoes by 2 weeks my face was so clear of acne scars etc. and it helped with my face texture that I had going on and I know this is some random comment has nothing do with your video lol . P.s I love all your videos Jackie !!!❤️
I love how much I learn from Jackie Aina's channel! She's so smart, funny and makes learning fun!! Now I'm on the market for an SPF
A Chemical sunscreen for normal/dry skin is Aveeno protect and hydrate SPF 50. And it’s only $10. No cast, it’s beautiful 😍
Thank you so much for this video!!!
OMGGGG the Alba Mineral Sunscreen is AMAZING !!! Absorbs in completely 😊
AUNT JACKIE!! I found the Benefit Dream Screen as a mini in a skincare set on Macy's website!
Jackie you have to store the colourfx bottles upside down.
This was really helpful! I was in need of a spf for my face!
Also for everyone, I want to recommend that the actual amount of sunscreen you should apply is anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 a  tbsp, yes, tablespoon.  If you apply anything less than that you are not reaching the claimed protection your sunscreen offers. This is scientifically proven, i am not  sure why  Western brands don't give that kind of  information :/ . Sorry I don't have the sources right now but you guys can google it if you want confirmation :)
Jackieee what did you use to lay those EDGES THOOOOO??
I love you for being that Auntie! 💖 You've inspired me to invest in an spf outside of my foundation. I'm a pale little cave-dweller, though, so I rarely see the sun. 😂
You’re hilarious and so positive! Love your videos.
I'm a manager at ulta the most recent benefit cosmetics training they sent us to. They had us try different techniques with the dream screen. Mixing it with porefessional before applying to the face is a dream!!!!! You can also mix it in with their triple moisture cream if the matte sunscreen is too dry for you.
Can you recommend a sunscreen that does not leave your face looking chalky and works for those who are allergic to chemical sunscreens? I have been using the Coola Mineral Matte(?) and like it , but it does leave me a little casper looking
I use the La Roche-Posay Anthelios 50 Mineral with zinc oxide and and titanium dioxide. The feel on the skin is great, and there is minimal white cast if any on my MAC NW20 skin. It's $33 in the US, and feels silky and not overly greasy on my dehydrated skin.
I'm pregnant, so I can't use chemical sunscreens right now. I'm hating using physical sunscreens. I'll have to try one of these after the baby is born.
I click like every time I hear Jackie, Jackie, Jackie, Jackiiiieee, Jackie, Jackie, Jackie!!!!!
What would you recommend for the Body?
she's a veteran, she's army strong but she's still also not trying to break a nail LOL
I love this video it’s so informative. I need to look better at these ingredients, 😂
😂😂😂 What's good YouTube Square up👊 Get them notifications together. \nI need some SPF in my life. I never wear any smh. I'ma do better lol.
Awww, is that Eggy you're wearing?! Jenn Im's clothing line? Loved the video Jackie! As always girl, you keep me laughing and informed! 😊
Oh shit I love Evelyn too!
Beautiful video! Would love it if u would have a peak at my channel and maybe like or subscribe to it.  I will be posting videos weekly!!
You don’t understand how happy I get when you start singing “Jackie Jackie Jackie Jackie Jackie Jackie Jackie”😂😭
I’m definitely going to Sephora to check a couple out. Thanks for this Jackie❤️
IM HOLLERING MAMA WHYY DID YOU PUT ONE OF THE GROSS SISTERS FROM THE PROUD FAMILY😢😂😂😭😅😂😍MRS.JACKIE😅
Jackie your edges look so good 😍😘
If u are in asia...try sunkiller perfect watery essence (non alcohol version) gurll...itssss good...
there is no such thing higher than SPF 50 , they can say its higher eg. SPF70 but its a lie lol
I'm a sunscreen girl everyday since I was 14 no matter what. People ask how I'd get my makeup to last all day and I swear the spf helps it to stay all day. I call it the original primer.
What about Banana Boat? Lol
Thank you
Came here from Bretmen Rocks snap😛😛
You are awesome!
**SKIN CANCER DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE**\n👏🏾👏🏾 yasss aunty Jackie!
Lmaoooooo beetlejuice 😂😂😂😂😂😂 dead
Thank you Auntie Jackie!! #blackgirlmagic✨
Jackie!! you have me rolling lmboo!
Lmao oops I thought adding spf products together actually worked.
Neutrogena oil free moisture?
My Auntie Jackie shouted out my Cousin Evelyn!
From my own experience, if you have sensitive skin, extremely sensitive skin, maybe stay away from the chemical barriers. I've had even the best break me out. CeraVe and Cetaphil make decent oxide/physical barriers where I c an usually  get them to rub in mostly clear. If you  use a powder foundation you can actually tent it yourself as well. It's not usually that deep for me lol
Is it weird that I set my sunscreen? It just helps lower the oily look and makes it feel better on the skin
Orange suits you so well! Love your channel! :)
It's really amusing that americans get offended by this, while europeans love it. This is pure rock 'n' roll. A drunk former rock star who lost his once great voice screaming like Johnny Rotten and forgetting the lyrics of a song by his own favorite band, then inviting a random girl up on stage to sing and then ending everything stage diving. This is pure punk rock. Not some americanized plastic crap like Green Day.
Legend has it liams still crowd surfing
Liam the last fuckin rock and roll star!
It's alright, he was just fuckin' drunk 😂 It could have been perfect if he was sober. But it's not THAT embarrassing. People act like it was a huge tragedy ... don't be too serious pals!
Liam is the ultimate frontman, he just owns it
Sucks up to the godsmack version tbh
This is a real awesome fucking amazing shit!!!!!
The best rockers of the past 30 years.
Dude he's obviously drunk probably just wanted to chill with the guys he's good friends with dave.  I've heard this song a hundred times and can't remember the lyrics.
This was completely improvised i guess and that's why Liam couldn't do the lyrics. It was interesting though.
Liam is a terrible singer
Liam Gallagher should make this into an actual cover song. And record it with Foo Fighters and Joe Perry from Aerosmith.
Didn't expect him not to know the lyrics tho.. no hate, it's just a fuckin jam who gives a shit but it did surprise me, he claimed to idolize lennon, I would barely call myself a Beatles fan and I know at least the first verse cos this is a banger
get a life liam you never have and never will write or sing a song as good as any beatles song... it's a shame but also a fact
Great Britain kick them together
Jesus loads of people fuming in the comments, what a legend Liam is
Trow that damn mobile phones away can't see nothing....
His voice can't hit those power notes anymore.  Too bad...
Sorry to say it but Liam totally messed this song up.
Who is the girl?
Somehow this is still amazing even though liam fucked the words lol
Epic moment, The Legend Squad !!!
Weak out of tune wtfs happened to the voice of a generation just sounds tired shouty and naizily
reading the lyrics of his favorite band?going to a chorus at the start where it should be another verse?Getting the words wrong in the first verse?being out of key?And then resorting to pulling someone out of the audience to finish it for him, and as shit as she is shes still better than him?\nI wouldnt have my hood up, id have a bag over my head.Fucking joker.
Fucking rubbish. Useless cunt. He doesn't even know the arrangement of the song nor does he know the lyrics. Look em up before you stone island fans start spouting shite. The guys a fucking knob end no wonder Noel fucked off. At least the brains he had went to his head unlike his semi-retarded brother.
That’s not pure rock n roll - that’s pure embarrassing
Golden! Golden!... Liam knows what are the good things of life hahahaha
I think I just saw Liam Gallagher's ass crack.. \n-Dave Grohl
Foo at city stadium next year hope Liam comes that has to happen my home town will shit itself
Liam knows that FF concert is the only thing on the world you can do that. Biblical.
supposedly a big beatles fans... doesn't know lyrics to one of their biggest songs XD
If he wasn't smashed out of his face and he had autoque on so he didn't forget the words and that irritating woman wasn't there this would have been even more amazing...even doing this half hearted his vocals are brilliant and it suits him even more than lennon
Dave grohl went to the back because of embarrassment or rock n roll?
If he just came out there and sang it properly and pretented to be a decent frontman, I would probably just watch it once and never again cos these guest performances are boring anyway. But I swear I have watched this like 50 times already and it's also so much fun reading comments of people complaining how pissed off they are with this. Why do people take music so seriously? It's just entertainment, nothing more. The dude was obviously having fun. And by the way, Lennon doesn't give a f**k what's going on here cos he's dead!
O Liam é bom demaaais! É puro rock and roll, ele vive a música, quando eu o ouço eu sinto a força de um verdadeiro rockstar entrando pelos meus ouvidos
Super-great! But short pants are so passe
It would have been biblical if Joe Perry had knocked Liam out with his guitar.
Wow Liam is Rock n Roll.
Shame that twat Laim is in it
Think what this needs is another guitar
I was there... Liam is such a fuckin toolbag
Totally awesome, the best of USA and uk united on one stage.
So some douche bag comes up and talks in the mic ... doesn't sing.\nAnd this gets 1K+ thumbs up?\nLOL!\nFU
Nice video thanks for sharing. please visit my channel for more videos like this \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW6xNtP6pnfXXXXp7cvSTOw
How any one can watch this and not realize how badly Liam butchered both the timing of the lyrics and the lyrics themselves is beyond me
Mic cupping like a pro, Liam really fucked this up
Shorts and a hoodie? How old does the twat think he is? And he can't reach the high notes. And I don't care how hard he tries, he will never be Joh Lennon.

Liam reminds me of a softer version of Phil Anselmo in this.
Liam can't sing like he used to. How voice sounds like an old man trying to do a Liam Gallagher impersonation from the 90's.
Best part is I was there and HOLY FUCK trust me when Joe Perry got on stage\nI punched my friend in the arm and said This is gonna be fuckin AWESOME!
Why is he reading the lyrics it's a beatles classic?
The funny thing is ppl here worried about he fucked up the lyrics. Hahaha.   LIAM.  A FUCKING LEGEND
When random crowd chick knows the song better than dude from one of England's greatest rock bands
Its a mash up but I liked it.   Not about getting it spot on exactly; having a good time is more important.
I love Liam but i'm seriously disappointed in him for fucking the lyrics up!!!
Oof how the mighty have fallen. He's too old to be doing the trainwreck dance. Be more like Noel. Classy, cocky, confident, delivers.
People taking Liam too serious are either Americans or boring.
It’s the 2nd coming....
this thing is a total nonsens haha
Lead guitar is so off...like liam...damn
I'm the like 1k 😎
Who TF doesn't know the words to this?
The video cut it off but right after this Grohl was laughing his ass off and just said into the mic yeah THAT was planned
Off guts ? Or just plain shite
Bem Loko!!!!
Holy shit
Sometimes shit don't go well and that's what makes it rock n fucking roll people. Enjoy it when it's great & when it's shit. Just laugh and rock out 🤘
Over Dave. Over Joe. Over Taylor. Over Everyone!
Liam! The best
Liam is back... LEGEND
Liam is pure gold
crowdsurfing yeah!
That was Koranic.
Zero Fucks Liam
tan Liam <3
Liam fucking it up again.
gostosa
Jeesh look at all the sycophantic comments! Cringe.
Wrong lyrics!!!!
HOLY SHIT
Hahaha
Manc cock
Did Liam get back alive tho????😐
In Love
Iconic
Hi
Piece of crap.
Am I awake
This collab would just never happen
Für den Musikexpress ist es Fremdschämen,für uns ist es Rock n Roll...
Warum ist dieser Sänger so beliebt? Es ist eines der bekanntesten Songs der Beatles und er bekommt es nicht auf die Reihe sich den Text zu merken steht auf der Bühne als ob er ein Stock im A.... hat.
Liam Gallagher: Claims to be a massive John Lennon fan, doesn't know the words of Come Together smh
THIS IS ROCK N ROLL, SHIT MORONS
Am I the only one that feels it was kinda douchey that he had to have the lyrics in front of him, even more so to hold it up in front of the crowd? Liam seems beyond bored this point... His performance of Wonderwall at Cal Jam was sad, just blah...
This is my favourite Beatles song...\n\n\nShame Liam sung it
Careful with the chicks Liam, you’ll get in trouble again.
Omg he doesn't even know the lyrics, he is supposed to be a big Beatles fan 😅
Looking at some of the comments on here - I just sometimes think not all Americans 'get' Liam Gallagher - in Britain he's like a God (for my group of friends/family anyway growing up!) loads of people commenting calling him a douche-bag or whatever - I don't think they get it - it's just supposed to be abit of fun and the guy was probably tanked up and just having a laugh with the crowd-surfing etc - long live the greatness that is Oasis! X stay young, love forever and don't look back in anger ;-) X
Liam ist ein riesen scheiß Idiot.
Did I hear that right? Did they say that all of the content mentioned from the 2018 roadmap was going to be _free for all Horizons players?_
cant wait for the EXPLORATION YESS YESSS YESSSS !!!!! Finaly
I remember a time when software companies would release a game, then not support it, then release a new system so that you would have to re-buy the game, AND the system.  We have it pretty damn good as Elite Dangerous gamers!  THANK YOU Frontier.
I don’t care what everyone else says, I am looking forward to this and am VERY happy with the announcements.
Space loach bobble head?
good to see them crack down on the core of the game finally, wish it happened sooner but hey.. better late than never. Also really excited to see this new generation of ship design we will be seeing!
Love the road map & where we are all heading CMDRS! Keep up the sterling work Frontier.
So, Thargoids = shitty space flowers? I'm really disappointed. This devs have zero imagination.
So if I find a thargoid base the location will be saved at the codex?
So THAT'S how they made the thargoid noise....never would have guessed!
The main problem FD have here is the impatience of the general public. Give 'em a rest guys.
Thats gOOD! space legs can w8!
Why is the volume always so low on these videos?  Nothing else on YouTube requires me to turn the volume up to max on my PC!
It's a bit unexciting.
I think Elite Dangerous could be open to improvement almost indefinitely, rather like what we see with WoW (graphical updates would be easy to implement, likewise the UI).
Sorry, expand what narrative? Maybe I missed it in my many hours of playing the game. I have yet to see any in game narrative. The player is dropped into the middle of nowhere with no direction given and if you never search the net you would have no clue as to what is going on in the game. So I ask again, what narrative are you planning on expanding?
It's great to see continued support for this game,  great work guys.  Ps4 player
tbh, i only want 2 things from ed atm; i want at least another 10 yr on the jump range of my python, and the ability to equip at least one fighter. of course, that would shift the python from, arguably the best ship in the game, to, undisputedly the best ship in the game.
Wow. Devs your doing a great job on a great game, can't wait for 2018. Keep it coming, the commanders are eager.
Will players be able to pilot the carriers or just set jumps to certain fixed locations? Will they be able to engage carriers in PvP like 2 capital ships deploying fighters against each other or just keep them as mobile bases for easier access to common effort goals?
i think we need more class m planets ,to boldly take on star citizen ,as there art work is amazing ,i think having more ships and planet art work is a drop in the ocean ,there is already software for that,but if elite can pull of landing on a class m planet ,and walk around finding materials ,etc,i would think they are cracking it,and taking challenges on.
I really like the game and bought horizons today. What i really don't like is the fact that i have to pay for a simple jacket for my hologram and ship skins after i did pay €65  (77$) total for the game. I could understand that if it's a free game to play but this is just greedy.  Even the deluxe edition give some free skins and i did pay more cause i already bought the Mercenary Edition. Pay some respect to your customers and give them some skins and goodies for free.
Alliance has no rank so we wont be grinding ive already grinded for the cutter and corvette fully engineered i will grind no more but thats me im over grinding. And that was one hell of a grind to do all that. And i did it all legit.
Extremely pleased with the revival of the Krait. Chieftain looks like a beast too. Get a wriggle on Frontier, I need these two in my fleet.
I remember a dev video when the game was about to release what most devs would love to see in the game... and 80% of them answered space legs, boarding, walking around stations etc... 3 years later we have nothing and not even planned for 4th year...  Another thing is where the hell are the atmospheric planets? The rocky planets you have shown... we already had beautiful planets in the game before you nerfed em to the bone (most likely coz of consoles) you know?\nAnd when comes to lifetime season pass honestly how should i feel? Paid much more for it than horizon cost, whole 2018 is gonna be free (ofc game fixing should be free) and who knows whats gonna come after that if there will be anything...\nBTW group missions should have been out with wings update long time ago...
Well so no major announcement... Still grinding in a huge empty nutshell...
I'm a bit concerned about what they classify as 'Narrative'..😒 Narrative is not a new gun or gadget for your ship, and 'narrative' is NOT seeing blocks coming out of the ground or dropping cargo and watching a ship change colour when it takes it on board. They reeally need to look up and re evaluate what theybare calling narrative here.. Lets face it, if any of the things i mentioned was the story in a game or movie, it would be absolutely ripped apart for its so called narrative. What they're calling a narrative here, makes the story in the first Destiny game look like Tolstoy in comparison lol
2018 sounds like it is going to be more interesting than 2017!  Looking forward to it.
Another year and you still can not get out of your ship and walk around.
GalNet pictogram (star) is like as Thargoid interceptor :)\nAnd in general this star has 8 rays, but in animation only 7 rays.\nWhy?
Haha this skinhead guy is so genuine sweet as he laughs and smiles all the way throu :D I love it!
WTF ever happened to the idea of being able to land on planets with atmosphere?  That went out the window 2 years ago it seems.
At this rate, SC is going to have some serious competition.
A question on the future squadrons and fleet cariers.if squadrons are group based and and fleet cariers bought by groups . how will they resolve the problem of groups that have pc/mac, x-box, playstation members as they dont show up in in friendlists or private groups.
Do we know what size the Chieftain will be? I've already got two endgame ships, I feel like the game needs more super high lever stuff.
I'm no scientist, but doesn't fog and vapour require atmosphere? We are landing on barren rocks....where's the fog and vapour from?
Nothing new here then.. No landing on planets with atmosphere. No real market between players, just two critical things which come to mind.  \n\nI think the lead designer is a classic example of talking the talk by the way he looks but there is no walk the walk.  \n\nThe game was effectively dead when they decided to implement it via p2p instead of the way every other mmo type game does imho, I said it at the time, got shouted down by fanboys as I will now no doubt but hey its your money,, keep buying them bobbleheads..\n\n:)
I'm enjoying reading all the comments and can't believe how awesome the game is coming along.  My personal push and shove to actually play the game is that we finally have 'THE THARGOIDS.'  I searched black and blue in the original Elite.  Now if only I didn't feel so retarded trying to actually play this new Elite I'd probably play it more.  So far I've installed it, got scared off by the tutorial and my brother couldn't believe how incredibly bad I was at it.  Which is a real shame as I'd love to be able to play it and join in.  Was happy to back it at a high level on Kickstarter and I'm glad that many fellow space gamers are enjoying the result. Great presentation and I think it's fantastic that Elite is being updated and enhanced without destroying the things that make it great in the process.  Essentially you can take all this great new stuff in or leave it and continue playing the game the way you like to play it.  ROCK ON COMMANDERS!!!!! It looks like Elite Dangerous is not going to go the path of EVE Online which is a great aspect indeed.
They should merge The Sims with Elite Dangerous. Having crew members, associates, competitors and enemies that procedurally generate personal narratives. Something that isn't spelled out but rather interpreted by the player.\nI hate the galactic simulation and the voting by grinding on these narratives as they call them.
Would love to see the the amount of NPC encounters in the game increased - too often you find yourself scouring the galaxy for a good amount of combat opportunities / waiting around in mining sites for a 'Wanted' enemy to appear - i want to see squadrons of 20 pirate ships from same faction appear on your scanner gunning for loot.
and the enginieer RNG still remain... what a joke !
Let the Python carry a single fighter.
This was done really well and very professionally... Wow. It's almost like a talk show.
Who knew all this time that a thargoid sound was made from a bass clarinet
I think I would have been happier if Elite was only now being launched.  Having bought the game and the Horizons pass Elite is only now beginning to be a full game worth the money. Hopefully it can attract  some of the players that gave up long ago to give it another try.
Ah thanks 3303 but I've already died in my vulture a couple of times, I'm gonna take a break.
Get rid of the dam warping mini game what a huge waste if time!!!
I waited over 20 years to play Frontier again!  Teenage years spent playing Frontier Elite 2 in UK it was a great game.  The one reason I bought a PS4 Pro was to play Frontier Elite Dangerous (the wife was not keen on a crazy priced laptop for one game!).  Now a 36 year old in New Zealand and still loving the atmosphere the game produces.  I sneak in about 4-5 hours play a week = not much but it's time well spent!  Thank you Frontier for a quality product.
I'll believe it when I see it... late next year....
I'd like to see additional surface vehicles, and outfitting for them as well.
A Ship launched miner would be awesome with multicrew !
The amount of RNG in engineer mods in the game right now. If those personal narrative guns are as unique as told, then they worry me a lot....
I wonder if the planets I have already explored will appear in the codex. Also loving all the content. I think i'll drop a few £ in some cosmetics to make it clear. The way I see it my expansion pass is pretty much payed in full already.
I would love to see my crew onboard my vessel. Perhaps sitting on the bridge, or using npc spacelegs walking about.
They are improving a bunch of core game mechanics such as better multiplayer interaction, improved exploration(I'm hoping this means they are adding more variety to procedurally generated nebulae and maybe even improving known nebulae) improved planetary exploration, better engineering, the type 10(what do you expect it to look like? Obviously it's gonna look like the type 9 it's a part of that series). They have gave you a reason to grind rank for the alliance, and obviously some bug fixes. So now they can work on either atmospheric planets or space legs. Or is there gonna be a problem that is just you and not the game? (Don't say I'm saying the game is perfect)
exploration carriers that can scan several light-years and give the probability of life in the systems it scans?
why are these expos always so cringe? why are they always so nervous? everyone is there for the same reason so relax and have some fun, especially the audience! The host had to work so hard to keep it intact... if your at the expo then maybe you should all be jumping out of your seats and be excited, it would put the developers at ease more and its a lot less awkward to keep telling the audience to settle with humor than having to encourage them to clap??? what is wrong with this world these days??? Why is everyone wound up so damn TIGHT? chill out, laugh, relax, its a game, not a un summit haha
Why is it taking so long to overlay a simple optional wireframe grid on a planet surface, to help with navigation when it's dark (or for bad weather)? Even films as old as 'Alien' managed to portray that!
Amazing narrative? You mean the bland blocks of text you call Galnet, amrite?
Thanks for that FD!
Any mention of 4k option for the PS4 PRO and at least support for the PS4's camera for head tracking.
Cmon,i just need to know where the Monolith is and how can i see the You Win Screen at the End of the Grind(Game).
I'm only watching this because I like Sandy!
I really hope that the trade changes don't just come with stuff to make it easier, but also balance it out to make it more challenging with markets that respond to player action. So like, when some one or a group discovers something lucrative, there's a limited amount of farming they can do on that market before profits drop, so that a good trader will constantly be on the move looking for the best profits
So...\nWhat about space legs.\nWhen are we going to see them or you know...\nBE ABLE TO WALK AROUND ON DOES FUCKING EXPENSIVE SHIPS THAT WE GRIND LIKE A MOTHERFUCKERS FOR. \nI'm just asking out of curiosity for a friend.
Does all look very nice and shiny, just a shame we have to wait a year for it all.
бла бла бла .. где бл... ноги ?  ноги где ?!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I've got one thing to say to the Devs, grinding is not game play.
Cool. Galnet audio (no sarcasm).
No Panther Clipper?
Spess pinecones.
ALLIANCE SHIPS NICE!
YEAAA BOOiiiiii~~~~  *cringe*
Just give us atmospheric planets that we can land on and I’ll be happy... thanks bye
Branching mission tasks someday with decision nodes ?
Elite: Dangerous = heavily slept on game
Sandro likes trex jokes???
MAKE POWERPLAY FUN (AGAIN, NOT)
SPLENDID! <3
👌😊
Personal narrative = massive grind
Okay no space legs.... but hot damn I bloody like what I saw and heard here... good job Frontier 👏👏👏👍👍👍
I got the feeling that ED's roadmap presentation is like watching a Microsoft keynote.
Chieftain requirements-aquire rank legend in alliance navy. mission grind incoming!
In other words, no need to come back to ED before Beyond update.
Very excited for Elite in 2018! Thanks FDev!
I really hope the exploration update improves jumping.  It's the exact same particle effect with the exact same sound, which you get to watch a hundred times during a gameplay session.  It needs something to spice it up, or it should take 1/4th the time.  I understand it's doing the Stellar Forge thing as well as finding sessions, but systems can be optimized.
Hopefully the Mamba, Moray and Boa find their way to ED too.
I can picture the q4 release already. It won´t come in q4 2018, but hey... they didn´t explicitly say that it´s not going to arrive in 2018... so... they are still on time... I really enjoyed how the game started. Especially the amount of insight FDev gave us into the dev-process. but now, their newsletters are basically galnet, new cosmetics and a picture of a child touching a hotas. I miss when they actually seemed to do something :-(
Just popped back on after half a year away from the game. Took a passenger tourist mission worth 2.5mil for a few hundred ly. The last visitor beacon was 250kls from the main star, so I pulled up the Steam browser and Googled Elitge Dangerous Sucks while I waited. \n\nThis game just isn't for me. Too little challenge spread across too much time. It doesn't really sound like that's about to change.
I would like Galnet Radio to have funny fake ads like GTA radio stations
Please guys in 2018 we need be able to...walk everywhere! PLEASE!
Hum... maybe this new lighting of theirs will allow the Mac version to have planetary landings?\nThe main thing holding back a Mac version of Horizons was, if I'm not mistaken, a shader incompatibility in the Mac's OpenGl library, correct?
I feel like Q4 2018 will be the day ED meets a lot of the expectations people had when it launched. Can't wait!
everyones excited everyones passionate .. but none of them actually play the game ...
Maybe the team needs to take the quarter off and actually play their game .. On second thought one week off should suffice.
They could of saved this for next year ..we waited to hear stuff for next year smdh I couldn't believe when they said it and the end of it at that..wow I'm so happy..not just like why talk about or bring up t10 if it's not until next year and who really going to fly it..I hate the 9 slow azz
If those new Thargoids aren't called 'Angels' then there is no justice in the universe.
again BLA-BLA-BLA(( Where CONTENT???
Too little, too late. Star Citizen's still in alpha and has more to offer in v3.0 than the glorified puddle of a game you've put together.
unexpected perfection.

I am curious to see the link to the original video. Looking at beer label, it appears to me that letter i is used, that is indication that it is not really a Russia Russia, but likely either Ukraine or Belarus. Not saying that there is a huge difference, but....

The dislikes are from Costa for being pocketed by Per in FA cup final
So happy he is a part of this club, sometimes it's ticks me off when Wenger is always talking about the values of the club but this video puts that into perspective. Cheers Per!
He is truly a great captain
This man is all class
Good guy Per.
Wow his English is pure fluent better than Kane tbh
I feel proud that we have such a fantastic club captain!
If Arsenal FC was a man it would pretty much be Per 👏
top man,such a difference to other top paid footballers,who only think of cars,watches,bimbos and of course themselves
Our Captain 😊
Nacho : for more bidio's 😂😂😂😂
How can anyone dislike this
you can see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice that he cares. it's great that he cares.
Per Mertesacker, a true leader in many areas of life. A good example, strong but humble character. He is an example of what we lack in today's society, not just in football, for a man to stand up and be a leader and but remain true and humble. What a brilliant man.
More people need to be like that. Including me.
now i know why wenger chose him to be our club's captain
O captain, my captain! I salute you per! Makes me think what about ozil and other german players? Did they do social year too? Cos i damn sure they won't go for 1 year military service...
BFG is beautiful being and example to us all.
Per really looks like a young Arsene Wenger when he was young lol
Class act on and off the pitch 👊👊
Please don’t retire. Ever.
I honestly love Per Mertesacker. He will always be a legend whilst he retires.
I'll always love this guy. Always. What a legend. Humility builds great leaders.
Big Friendly German once again showing the young Guns what Sportsmanship is all about.
I hope he develops into a successful manager. Guy is a gem
Big _Friendly_ German awww
What a guy per mertesacker BFG⚽️. My G
BFG is a leader and born motivator
Such a gentle giant. Per you beautiful soul. Keep up the good work!
What a genuine and lovely person respect per
All young players, from ALL clubs, watch & learn, BFG, top man,
I just love this club so much
manutd fan here, have to admit I have always looked up at to him both on and off the pitch
The depth of character of this man...geez Louise.  It's an absolute honor to have him represent The Arsenal on and off the pitch.  I hope he remains with the Club in various capacities long after this final campaign.
This man has went from hero-Legend-God
Gary hurt Per's eye 😭
The fans captain\nInspiring
He gives so much back to the community. Could do with a politician like him tbf
Values of this club were always top , love you Per.
What a great man.\nReally hope he can instill the same values he has on the younger lads (not saying that they don't have it) and raise them to be leaders, not just football players.
Remember who you are, what you are, and who you represent.
Well done and nice video UP THE GUNNERS🖒
Respect! It's good of Arsenal to keep hold of him
I love this guy man.. what a legend.
people who dislike this have no heart
Mertesacker one of my all time favorites. This man's form in 14/15 damn!!
Thanks Per, that was touching and lovely
Per is a Model, Arsenal is the BRAND 👌
Respect for this guy 💪💪
Hey I have huge respect for such work\nAnd I completely believe in the words \nSaid by him\n“ being humble and serving the society in what ever way we can “
You cannot hate Per Mertesacker
Legend💪🏾
Love this guy
our captain! <3 :')
Deutsche Mentalität haha😂 sympathischer Typ, der Merte
hi Per Mertesacker
Per is a one of a kind.
I can't wait until he takes over the Arsenal academy. He is going to be such an important asset to youth development. Legend.
Hi  i love the guners please can play in your team  please 😢 🙏
Hopefully his last game with Arsenal is winning Europa League trophy! #Respect #Legend
Wow. Such an amazing role model for Arsenal. So much respect for Per Mertesacker.
Fantastic!  Hope to see you on the pitch again soon.
A gentle giant and a great man.
Big f****** German - Top guy. A really nice guy.
The man's so elegant and refined he's even starting to look like Arsene
You are a very good man Per. Big fan. A man who is really down to earth, loves the club and fans. A true leader and real captain. Thanks.
Can see this guy becoming manager of our great club one day 🔴⚪️❤️
Hope Per always stays around the club, he's such a gentle, intelligent kind-hearted guy
We can have this great mentality.. and all the other great mentalities that Arsenal have AND buy top class players that might not meet the humble footballer and change them to be more humble once they're brought to Arsenal!!
my favorite player since he played his first few games at arsenal. what a guy
I hope Per stays in UK and with Arsenal for many years.
I don't even like football, what a great guy
What a great guy Per is.... really pleased he's staying on at Arsenal after he's finished playing. He has all the right values.
We Love You Per. You have opened my eyes. God Bless You
Announce Thomas Lemar signing in January
4 dislikes WTF... Spuds troll ?

MY CAPTAIN
BIG UP PER 😃
BFG! ❤
He's such a great guy.
Per is somebody that you just can't hate.
I appriciate this more than trophies.\nThis is per..this is Wenger..this is wenger's philosofy..this is arsenal!!!!!!!!!!
Mertesacker being a legend, as PER usual...
does germany still have that kind of national service?\nwe seriously need it in england
Top lad
Man like BFG

Much respect Per Mertesacker. Really touching example

Class pure class...thank you Per!
Craque.
Love mertesacker
Fantastic wall done to hem & Respect
Fair play per👏
Per mertasacker blond hair
wish English players had the values he has
He truly stands tall among men.
Guarantee you this guy would HIRE ARMED GUARDS at the slightest danger....he just does not want YOU to protect yourself.
People that cant be trusted with a gun should not be allowed in public unsupervised.
Guns aren't just meant to kill people. They protect family if you tell me that police were for that there are many police officers to tell you to get a firearm for. And if you say the wrong then the average response time is over 10 minutes how hard is it to kill somebody in 10 minutes especially when they don't even know you're coming and you don't have to have a gun to do it. Look at the incidents in Japan where a man attacks children with a knife and kills many of them and severely wounds others. Not to mention hunting. Protection from a tyrannical government even if the government, even if the government is not our own the reason why Japan's not bring War to us many years ago was because one General wisely said that there would be a gun behind every blade of grass. The fact is that the Second Amendment kept bloody conflict from coming to the United States. Have you ever thought about why our enemies don't come to our Shores for their Wars. It's not just because of our standing military. Our Second Amendment also helps prevent terrorism to a degree. If you don't like it so much you can leave I'm sure there's other places that would love to have you. (You just lost a subscriber)
30 plus years of going to gun shows, there is no fucking loophole! You can try to pass all the ill conceived gun laws but it will never stop criminals. If you really wanted to reduce the gun violence then we would have to end this ridiculous war on drugs.
Even before the gunshow loop hole laws were put in place a vendor had to be registered. Checks had to be carried out by the FBI and the national registration hotline for purchasers. I don't know what states you people are talking about but that has never been the way here since I have been alive. \nYou guys are beating an old dog on this one.
*THE WELL REGULATED MILITIA ARGUMENT AS COMPLETELY BOTCHED BY CRACKED*\nFuck you assholes 🖕🏽
Sending thoughts and prayers, twiddling your thumbs and preaching the second amendment. Replace preaching the second amendment with NOT ALL MUSLIMS and you have the perfect description of the left after EVER SINGLE MUSLIM TERROR ATTACK.
Solid joke at the end there
Will someone please take this fucknut to deepest darkest Baltimore/St. Louis/Chicago/Detroit/any other major black area, at night, and kick him out of the car, so he can later tell us ( if he lives ) how awesome it is to be defenseless.  Check out Colin Flaherty's channel if you want to see reality.  American citizens, conservative and liberal! that own guns, will NEVER give them up, because we're not stupid.  Unlike this walking talking twat at the political sjw desk of Cracked.
You know as a person who supports gun rights but also supports every single thing you said... Shit. No really I can literally for less than $1000 tomorrow go buy a bump fired brand new rifle and a 100 round magazine. Seems silly. I've been anti bump fire since day one when those came out. They are unnecessary. However I do like guns for hunting, sport, and in the incredibly rare case defense when necessary. The problem a lot of folks I have talked to about gun defense is that they don't understand what they are for. It's a serious problem that you don't have to be educated to buy a gun legally in almost every state yet you do have to be educated to legally use said gun to hunt. Essentially you can kill another human with less regulations than a deer. You'll get in more trouble for shooting a human but it was easier to do. \n\nBring on the flame war.
We all know that all you snowflakes care about is feelings and so thats why you think its ok to take peoples rights. Fuck You.
You are completely full of crap.
We avoid talking about gun control, is because no gun control measure would have worked in any of the most recent tragedies.\n\nGun control only stripes rights away from law abiding gun owners, not the ones that are illegally obtaining them & using them in various crimes.\n\nShort of a flat out ban (which is unconstitutional, see the 2nd Amendment), there is no measure of gun control that would stop those who use guns for evil.
I used to like y'all but this shit sucks it's all slander it's not funny it's just politics bullshit from liberal minds who bitch and whine and cry about America these pansy ass fucks and bump stocks are fucking awsome
https://www.cheatsheet.com/culture/city-gun-violence-kill-you-other-cities-want-avoid.html/?ref=YF&yptr=yahoo\n\nput that in your pipe and SMOKE IT!! Chicago made #4 on the list!! So fuck your emotionally driven video and use some FACTS!!!!
honestly, i dont know how i made it this far in life. Guns, running around killing people.
Don't laws protect people? Doesn't everyone have a police officer in their back pocket? No?   What's a restraining order? It's a piece of paper. Criminals don't obey laws, and don't care about gun control. You can take it all away, and yet a criminal will still obtain a gun, a van, and make a chem bomb. A criminal is an animal of opportunity, and thinks about path of least resistance. No resistance= open season... but don't let that get in your narrative
I am a avid gun owner but I still enjoyed listening to what you had to say. I did notice that you mentioned Fact don't care about your feelings line from Ben Shapiro. Why don't you invite him for a debate, it would be nice to see both sides of the argument in one place and not such a planned story.
This video sucks and you all gave no real answers or know anything about guns. Plus the purpose of a gun isn't to kill but primarily as a deterrent and self defense
Cruel bomb kill millions of people;  greed has poisoned men's soul.
Banning sugar in all processed foods would save significantly more lives and spare humanity more diseases than banning guns. Same goes for alcohol, sigarets, you name it. It's simply impossible to prevent all deaths without turning into some totalitarian hellhole. Guncontrol was the first sign of monstrous dictatorship in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia.
Why we avoid talking about gun control: because the people who are against it are fucking maniacs that cannot be reasoned with.
Oh my God, you're a fucking moron.
The suicide thing was stupid but yea i agree about the rest.
Hmm, at least 100,000 to 1,000,000 Iraqi's killed by our government, over a weapons of mass destruction program that didn't exist....\n\nYeah, I trust that group of thugs to be the exclusive owners of guns.  YOU CAN TRUST THEM...
Is it just me or is the lighting different this episode?
Yep Im going to say it, I would rather live in a world where there are mass shootings than ultimately be a subject in someones dictatorship.\n\nIts not the best tool but a gun is blind to corruption, its up to the people to know when and how to use it for the better of our collective freedoms.
F*ck this country. I'm done. The experiment failed. Thanks Cracked for showing this place is one running racist stupid insensitive joke.
We shouldn't let this distract us.  The most pressing issue we have is that we need to stop giving control over our nuclear arsenal to liars, psychopaths, and the mentally ill (I think that covers most of our presidents)
This is one of the best videos on YouTube. I've rewatched it a ton and shared it. Ignore the right wing people in comments Cracked, keep it up!
i honestly can't think of any way you'd convince gun owners to give up or even just regulate their precious, precious guns. doesn't matter how many people get murdered with them. anything that could possibly interfere with buying another sweetass firearm is too much, regardless of other people dying--they're just simply too selfish to give a damn.
Ok let's talk about gun control. Cars kill 10x more people yet more people want them. Why? It's it because it's useful tool? Now I don't go tell driving because it's dangerous and you have a chance of killing someone 10x more than guns. Also you say guns only kill. I'm sorry about what about sports shooting? Also let's look at NJ and CA, they are strict gun control states that also seems to have high gun crime for how strict the laws are. The best I have to say is it's a civil right. There should be no limitations as it states  shall not be infringed. The debate on if modern firearms count is stupid, they understood the concept of advancement in technology (they saw a musket go to a 15 round air rifle that could kill deer size animals). Lastly a quote that should mean something to everyone:  Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety. -Benjamin Franklin. So give up your rights, I'm not without a fight because without rights man cannot be free.
facts matter...and we need to be honest about them\n\nKill yourself.
Finally an American who gets it... great video
I think Trump may have been making light of a shitty situation. This vid is such nonsense I started rebutting things but thought I may get carpel tunnel.
I own guns to protect MY family. You call people with guns to come protect you...one way is immediate, and one way is slow.PEOPLE WITH GUNS SHOWED UP TO STOP A PERSON WITH A GUN IN VEGAS!! When you have a way to stop ALL people from killing in any way, call me (so how many people were killed when McVeigh used a truck and fertilizer, and not a gun?) . Its a mental issue problem, not a chosen method problem. If you wave your magic pen and make ALL guns in the U.S. disappear, you can bet your anything-you-want they will come right across the border. Drugs are illegal, kids. That fixed the drug problem and didn't make cartels rich and powerful, huh? Hey, sarcasm IS fun! Thanks, cracked, but I think I'll keep my tools of life protection!
If cops didn't have guns, the criminals woudn't need them!!!!
So guns are tools that can kill people. Congrats you only started the obvious but saying that we need regulations to stop mass shooting will not in fact stop a mass shooting. You can try and regulate or even straight out ban guns but what does it do besides put citizens who want to protect themselves or their families in a tough spot. Another thing is that you perpetuate the gun show loophole and say criminals can get their guns without background checks... Accept that's not what happens. It's already against state and federal law for license fire arms dealers to sell guns without checking the person first. What about private sales... Not many people have to get checked for that... Then in that case it is the individuals at fault not the tools. A little side note criminals don't necessarily need to buy guns from the gun show. They can make their own or steal from others. Your emotions show a lot in this videos and while feeling are necessary for life don't let you feelings misconstrue facts. Suicides is another thing you bring up, and yeah I agree with a gun they are more likely to kill themselves with a gun. However there are multiple weapons to kill oneself if not ways. The shooter was a coward and so are the majority of you for using that massacre to up your political agenda gun regulations and gun bans, because even in the end it's not gonna change a thing. You can regulate the gun or even flat out ban it. Criminals will find a way to do what they want even if it means taking the lives of some if not many.
The willful ignorance of some of these comments...is just...incredible. Like, did you even WATCH the video🤔
What part of Shall Not Be Infringed do you not understand?
Unsubscribed. If you hate guns and the second amendment get the fuck out of the country.
We need guns, not all guns kill people, however i do agree they need more regulations but not all guns r bad like u bad, like u said at 3:00 to 3:10 u basically said that all guns r bad, other then that great video
Disarm the cops first. That establishes a conversation.\n\nUntil that happens this is always give even more killing power to the police. No. ∞
yes, guns are for killing, and when an old person has a home invader, your method would just let them die.........i am wishing ass cancer on you. i have never ever been able to purchase a gun without a background check...been to many gun shows, never seen the loop hole in practice. you are right about the shady deal CA did on the Panthers,  that was pure illegal bullshit.
So per capita in homicide, Chicago is actually way down here...behind all these other cities with high minority populations, high poverty rates, high gun control laws, and Democratic leadership for the last 50 years. Tops on the list: New Orleans, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Oakland.\n\nAre you fucking serious? Can you in any way be more disingenuous to the point being made? Do you know what intellectual honesty and engagement with an argument is, how Chicago is a synecdoche, a useful talisman, not the goddamn argument itself.
NRA money is peanuts.  they aren't even close to the top 10 of lobbyists in america.  its because its a true grass roots organization.  oh yeah and the reason people panic buy is because they worry they won't be able to purchase it.   happens with everything, not just guns.
Until you can get rid of EVERY gun on the planet and stop people from wanting to murder others, there's no real effective measure ...
If you dont want guns to be regulated, maybe its because you are an asshole willing to shoot other people deep inside your conscious too.
You are literally the only reason I don’t wana do away with abortion
Money money money. \nMust be funny. \nIn a rich man's world.
CANT TAKE MUH HI CAPACITY GHOST CLIPS...seriously, they're mine and you can't have them.
shot for holding a toy gun\nyeah, because a cop could definitely tell a real and fake gun apart in a split second while his life depends on it.\nAnd by saying what will it take is just leveraging your point on a tragedy, which is shameful.
Because u can't control guns, u shouldn't, is not about control is about understanding, that a never ending problem no1 is whilling to talk about, so fuck u
I get it, just ban guns.  Self protection and self determination are evil these days anyways. I doesn't matter if it helps, just do something right.
Damn this video is the more bias than CNN
This is why I unsubbed from Cracked. But enjoy the free view.
Yes guns kill people. That's why we don't want the government to have a monopoly in killing people. Governments tend to have a history of turning its guns on its own people even in western nations like Germany.
Wow. Such happily delivered bullshit, I'm almost impressed. Perhaps you might learn a bit more about the subject and... I dunno... The English language?
300 million Americans and over 300 million firearms that we know but the death count is around 40,000 a year for the past 10 years. Yall talk about the gun violence like its 1 to 1 , if so we should all be dead. 13 million children in America have Food Insecurity, lets talk about that problem and leave us gun nuts alone.
Also, the argument that because guns are deadly weapons with no other use, then any other use is illegitimate is child-thinking. Killing is a reality of life, under certain circumstances killing is necessary to guarantee your own safety and integrity, the very reason government agencies carry guns is the same that every day citizens do, it's quite simple if you aren't a sheltered individual. This also is an argument which points to there being no legitimate reason to own a gun other than to murder people, and thus, ALL gun ownership being immoral and thus it should be treated as such . . . but then he says pro-gun advocates are crazy for saying that Democrats want to ban guns, when they are saying shit like this.
Nothing is ever going to happen to guns I think the government should hand out government guns and bullets and blame the state of Alaska where people are literally hunting with guns every day
Cracked is about as much news as The Onion.  Please just stick to Honest Ads seriously.
What in the actual fuck has this channel Come too!!!!!!!! Took a hard fucking left!!!!
For all Americans:  The rest of the world is passing you ideas on how to attempt to fix things and all anyone hears is about how that won't work....how about you come up with your own bloody idea then?  Didn't someone once say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result...what exactly are you waiting for?  the solution you have currently is not working...you don't like our ideas, find your own...or lock your borders and shoot each other
There has to be a compromise between the wild west and the draconian policies of foreign governments.
I'm leftist and love guns but this is irritating
Your a fucking dumbass

Anybody else getting these shit ads?
My rights are non negotiable . fuck off sheeple
Really tried to listen, stupid.
Well regulated when used in 1700s meant organized and/or supplied. It is also referring to the militia, not guns. Dumb Ass.
One thing that never gets mentioned. We've always had guns, for a long time. So why is it only now people are going places and shooting people? If it's not the guns, and it can't be if we've had guns as long as we have, what is it? Because in the end, if the Vegas shooter couldn't get a gun, he may have built a bomb, or something like it. Which is worse, at least in my opinion. I think we need to stop blaming guns (gun regulation is still a good idea, and should be researched better) for killing those innocent people and look at ourselves. What is our society doing to produce homicidal maniacs like him? Sure, there is will always be sadists and perverts, but why are there so many shootings compared with the past? I Have some theories, but it doesn't matter what I think. What matters is, while gun regulation is a good idea, that we focus on the root of the problem. Why are people all of a sudden blowing up buildings in New York, and waltzing into elementary schools with guns, and becoming neo-nazis, or how about putting porn in everything but kids shows? Saying curse words every other phrase? Why is this happening? Why is society choosing morally wrong actions, and then forcing everyone else (shooting victims, minorities, and literally everybody else) to suffer the consequences? That is the root of the problem. If you haven't already I suggest you read Fahrenheit 451. It's themes correlate with this stunningly. But, back on point, it doesn't matter what you do. Banning guns won't solve the problem, maybe in some ways, but it will cause new problems. The government can't fix society, and it's not fair we demand it does. It needs to start with us. We all need to make sure we live our lives with respect towards one another, and remember we all make mistakes and anger will destroy us, even if another person deserves it. We need to end political polarization and tear down private prisons. We need to look at the root of our problems. We can blame Obama for rising health care costs, or we can rightfully blame insurance companies for demanding ridiculous discounts, forcing hospitals to shoot up the price. Whatever you beleive, Obama was trying to help, and so are those that oppose him. (I fall into the latter category) we all want cheap, quality healthcare. But the root of the problem is lost when singular people, places and things get blamed. So let's find what the root cause is, and execute it with extreme prejudice.
Shitlib faggot. Our guns are the only thing protecting your free speech.  DUMBASS!!!  If not for our guns the jackboots would stand on your next and tell you to tow the line or take an ass raping.  \n\nEmotional liberal nonsense was annoying in the 90s with the rapist in the white house, now you commie Che Guevara cock sucking snowflake fucks are just pissing off the sane people left in this bankrupt NSA fap & war state. \n\nGrow the fuck up..
The NRA and RNC both ban guns from their conventions. Why aren't gun owners first attacking them for banning guns instead of attacking people advocating for gun regulation (non-ban) discussions?
Because the cities with the strictest gun laws also have the highest crime rates? Or because criminals don't obey laws? Hmm..
How do you prevent crazy?
Who the hell are you talking about?! The reason you don't hear about it is because you don't follow it! You have no idea how many gun laws get enacted each year in CA! As an actual gun owner that follows the law, we hear about the gov trying to take our guns ALL THE TIME!\n\nJust because you don't seek it out doesn't mean it isn't happening. \n\n better gun regulations doesn't mean banning more things or creating more restrictive laws. \n\nAnd yes, most of you all want to ban guns for private citizens. \n\nCriminals can legally buy vehicles, not firearms. \n\nJesus Christ. I wish I could actually have a conversation with you. You are arguing things that are inconsequential. \n\nHere's the bottom line; do you support the constitution or not? The constitution DOES. offer Congress the authority to add amendments, so the second amendment CAN be changed. Just remember, so can the first, because the founding fathers had no idea about the internet or tv or radio. So why should your 1st amendment right extend to anything further than your mouth and handwriting?
Insanity reigns.  Just checked and Bump stops are sold out everywhere or sales halted.  Prices skyrocketed to 400-500%.\nHundreds of people want a gun that can kill dozens and wound hundreds in a couple of minutes.  MASS INSANITY HAS TAKEN HOLD.
Australia did not had constitutional right to own guns. Mandatory buyback would start civil war. And also 80+ people were killed in France using a fucking TRUCK. Lets ban trucks
Mass shootings make me uncomfortable about going out in public.  So I bought a gun.  Multiple guns.  I feel better now.  I encourage you to do the same.
If my ancestors in Europe had guns then they would not have been Holocausted
Hi. American here. Freedom works
Fuck you! This shooting was done by the deep state to push gun control! How about some outrage over people we pay taxes to to protect us, who are going out gunning us down to push for take our freedoms?
fact: he was on psyche drugs, like ALL mass shooters last 30 years...dumbass!
Chicago has some of the strictest gun laws in the country. How has that worked out for them?
If 20 6-7 year old kids getting murdered at Sandy Hook wasn't enough to get people to do anything about gun regulation, I honestly don't think anything will come from Las Vegas either.
What's it going to take?\nA mass shooting where the casualties are primarily children? Oh, wait, I guess not. Never mind.
You managed to ignore during your guns only kill rant, the most important reason for the 2nd Amendment-  the prevention of a tyrannical government.
Correction - Cars drive and kill. Guns protect and kill.... to say the only use of a weapon is to murder, you're severely off base.
Fun fact, the soda he had in his hand is more dangerous than the average firearm, if you look at obesity rates and related deaths.
Can someone honestly and seriously explain to me what the FUCK the CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL has to do with GUNS?! I mean, call me crazy, but I always foolishly assumed that the Centre for Disease Control dealt with such things as DISEASES: outbreaks, mutations, treatments, developing inoculations (which apparently a large percentage of you won't even use anyway because you're so fucking stupid you think that it's safer to not take the chance your kid might somehow spontaneously develop autism as a side effect of vaccination, instead of ensuring they have a LIFETIME PREVENTATIVE from contracting a highly contagious and DEADLY disease. Smallpox may not be the danger it was 150 years ago, but it hasn't ACTUALLY been eradicated and cases are still reported regularly in countries such as Africa.... but that's a whole other rant for another day 😁). \n\nBack to my initial question: as much as the American gun obsession has been referred to as a disease, IT ISN'T ACTUALLY A REAL DISEASE. You won't be bitten by some kind of radioactive spider or tick or mosquito, or be exposed to gamma radiated germs whenever someone sneezes, which will cause you to spontaneously decide guns are awesome, I must have more guns, I must have all the guns, I need bigger guns that can fire more bullets, dear god, someone give me more guns. So WHY in the name of all that is... well, not a bunch of hypocritical selfish fucking bastards, would a DISEASE authority being doing research into the safety of guns?!?! \n\nSincerely, \nA very confused Australian who was a teenager at the time of Martin Bryant's Port Arthur Massacre (world record holder for a decade, Aussie Aussie Aussie) and who was inordinately proud of her country for standing up and saying, take these guns away and make sure this never happens again and the Government DID (John Howard will be immortalised in Australian history none of us will ever actually read forever for this one decision), who was also HORRIFIED when the Columbine High School Shooting happened, and NOTHING IN YOUR COUNTRY FUCKING CHANGED. Aussie guy, injures and/or kills men, women, children, teens, tweens, grandparents, etc, whole country rewrites its gun laws. Teenagers shoot up a high school, killing and/or injuring mostly teens and some adults, and the best that happens is a guy makes an award winning documentary about it which is derided by the very people it's trying to help. \n\nSeriously, I just don't understand. What's wrong with you? Why do you care so little for your own countrymen? How can you be so selfishly callous? \n\nBut more pertinently, what the FUCK does the CDC have to do with GUNS?!?!?!?
Congress can start with banning the sale of bump stocks and high cap magazines... \nI'll bet nothing happens... \nagain...
you sir irritate me, because even though guns were invented to kill, they still have to be used by a person to kill, guns in and of themselves do not kill people, you're just wrong about that
Speaking the truth.
The real struggle is having an eyebrow piercing and not being able to lay on your favorite side while watching asmr
I like your voice👍🏻
Finding the right position and the ads are so real for me
*OOOHH MOMMA THAT IS SO RELAXING* XD i think my brain just died for a sec lol
I'm so glad you put this out. I feel so much more normal had no idea I wasn't alone lol.
M O T H E R F R I C K E R
I FELL asleep the intense whispering 😂😂 and then a commercial
im using the same headphones you used in the beginning!
Still love you\nJust the way you stared at the screen 😂😂. It looked like your thought process vanished and your face froze into the expression of I regret noting I did but I do regret life\n\n😂😂😂😂
Taylor. You're the best. That's it.
Please do a house tour :)
All the stuff relates to me but not with ASMR just music
Ha me trying to find the perfect position 🤣😂
Taylor, I would love to give you a massage!
I get ALL of these!!
None if this ever happened to me, I must be really weird.
These are so truuu I'm definently leaving a like
When someone catches you tapping so you instantly stop or pretend its a joke.
Finally an Asmr-tist which knows memes. My life is complete
She understands the struggle!
You forgot when your brother puts on screaming ppl
I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WITH THE MUMMY CORDS DJJXJSXJFI
lol, all of them are relatable
Every time I get anxiety or if I'm just frustrated, I watch your videos and they make me calm and relaxed ❤️❤️
Does this happen to you or just me\n\n\nWhen you lay sideways with headphones and they just keep pushing on your ear so you try again and again
The ads one is so relatable as is dropping your phone on your face lol.
Why is Taylor so perfect and pretty😂💗💗💗
Noramally with struggles only (insert group of people) understand videos I'll try to convince myself that I actually understand but in real life I'm just like no I don't trim my pubes, it fookin hurts bruh. But with this video I'm just like 👌🏻Ohya, das right, you get me 👌🏻
OMAIGA ;; </3 I'm Me!
Omg this is so accurate. Frickkk
*This lol, omg, wtf video.*\n\n\nOk I'm done commenting 😂😂😂
CONGRATS ON 1 MILLION SUBS!!!
Hahaha so true
who else pronounces ASMR assmer
Mother Fricker
0.47 mother fricker
Oooooh mama

HYSTERICAL
Yep, I can relate.
Add block?
OHH MAMA THAT IS SO RELAXING
New 2017 slang omg pol wtf video
YASSSS THE WASTED MEME YASSSSS
Who hear watched same without headphones
The first part tho 😂
I know all about not getting comfortable
I'm so late but I'M SO PROUD,WE'VE REACHED 1M SUBS
Or when one of the earbuds stops working
I swear I thought I was the only one who gets strangled with headphones and it doesn’t feel good to lay down with headphones either \nALSO THE CHARGING IN THE MORNING
Omg yes yes yes yes!! All true!!!....lol great video!! Super cute  and really funny!!😍😘🤗😄😘
She has a YouTube Playlist Of ASMR videos? \n\n\n\n\ndamn. that's smart let me go start that.
It’s to true
how long did it take you to get your phone to 1% while trying to film this?
You forget when someone walks in when your listening, they pick up your phone, and scream, “WHAT THE HELL IS THIS!”
Your editing in this is 💯. Good work
That's great and all but guys have one more struggle to deal with. \nASMR boners.
Anyone else also watching this video in bed, on your phone with earbuds? :P
*DO YOU BELIEVE IN CAR INSURANCE!!!!!!!!?*\n\n_Imaginaaaationnn~_
Wow I really LOVE your video!! You and this other guy are my favs, yall both have really good content... He is new though, which is why i'm shouting him out... But your channel is doing awesome! Ill be sure to recommend you on any asmr videos! You should check out that guy spin-c tv. He has some tapping and whispering videos and other too. Check him out, for real it's really good quality for him being new, he has tons of potential and will be great when he grows.
I do not understand!
The cringe is strong but the truth is stronger
When you use Bluetooth headphones and can't find your phone in the morning...
the struggle is real
Once i was listen to Asmr and than The commercial FROM Annabelle came :))
*DO YOU BELIEVE IN GETTING THE BEST KIND OF CAR INSURANCE?*
WHY IS THIS SO ACCURATE OMF
*whispers* DO YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW TO GET THE BEST CAR INSURANCE?!
I have missed SO many alarms because I’ve fallen asleep to ASMR and it’s kept playing for like five hours and my phone dies
I'm watching asmr videos wrong I don't use headphone 🤦🏻‍♂️
I can really relate to the headphones problem
That moment when u accidently hit the cast button while watching asmr and panic trying to cancel it.... 😂
taylor M E M E   L O R D
Yay! She reached 1M!
omg..literally this morning...i was watching asmr, i feel asleep, and i woke up with 0% on my phone...i tried to charge it...I ended up going to school with 17%😫😢and it died...and just great: in one of my classes, we needed to use a device for research...i sat in class doing nothing for 30 minutes😒😬
I got another one. When you want to watch ASMR, but one of your earbuds is broken, so you have no choice but to listen to one-sided ASMR.
I hate when I’m watching an asmr video and my mom starts yelling my name... then when I ask her What, she doesn’t answer back. Then I have to physically go all the way downstairs to ask her... hate it.
SO MUCH TRUTH IN THIS VIDEO
Love you Taylor Darling!
*OOH MAMA*

356? What calender do you follow?
365 days of youtube torture
Great tribute to a legend.
I love Brandon for always paying homage to those that influenced him and came before him. I love all the music he always mentions and talks about. I guess I connect to him in that way. Great video and cover!
Why I love music.....Petty was the best.
I was there😊 they were amazing 🔥
this made me so happy that they did this
The Killers have always struck me as having Tom Petty and Heartbreakers' songwriting sensibilities (sure they may get a little more ornate sometimes, with Sam's Town seeming like an homage to Queen) and Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band's energy. Flowers' voice forces you to focus on the heart before the head. He's got a gift.
One of my favorite songs sung by my favorite band. Awesome!
Thank you for posting! Fantastic from a fan who is very fortunate to have see Tom and the Heartbreakers live many times in 3 decades. He would be blown away by this fantastic cover by such a talented band! Amazing...
This made me cry...
And then segueing into Mr. Brightside. Perfect tribute
At least they're set will one good song
For a cover, it's pretty darn good! Huge respect to The Killers for this amazing tribute.
Watched this live! Great way to open to the show!!!! They should do this cover on their next Sawdust type album!!!
Such an amazing way to start a great set. So happy I made it out!!!
That was awesome, thanks so much! Beautifully done!
Feels
They were absolutely amazing at ACL!!!!
Hi there,\n\nDid you shoot this video footage? If so, we would like to use it as part of an article on our website Radio X - http://www.radiox.co.uk and also  associated social media channels with a credit.  Could you please get back to me asap and let me know if this is ok? Many thanks!\n\nCrystal
The sentiment was lovely, but the result was awful. I've heard better bar bands---not that I expected the killers to live up to the musicianship of the Heartbreakers to begin with.
Free update and people are complaining.\n\nWow, please ignore them Frontier. A lot of us love the free content we are getting. Keep up the good work.
Hi Planet Coaster, I have few more ideas for the game: \n- It can be good if we could make attractions more original ( like changing the height of the screamenator)\n- Can you do a ferry for making little tours ( like in Disney Land in Paris )\n- Can you do Coaster which are launch on an ascent ( like Space mountain in Disney Land in Paris), and launch coasters whith a Square rail ( like Kingda Ka )\n- Can you do like differents types of trains for one type of Parkour ( if I want to do Kingda Ka, I can only use the Ferrari train)\n\nI'm very happy whith cascade, I wated for it long Time ! \nI'm french so there might be mistakes but I love your game, continue to improve it.\nI hope you'll read this, and like if you are agree !
Looking forward to it, can’t wait! The devs do a wonderful job on this game, you’ll can be very proud of it. Thank you for showing my Pixel Island park in the community video, so cool! 😍🌎🎢
PICNIC BENCHES!!!!
Unbeliveble what this Team fo us do. Thank you very much Frontier for your work and the next Update.
Would really like to see a water slide / pool dlc
I love building theme parks thank you for this amazing game and congratulations for this first anniversary 👏🎢🎡
Picnic benches !! I want beach chairs ! LOL no this will be a cool update. Thanks frontier.
Thank you for continuing to bring us so much content for free! Fantastic team of devs!
Where's the skyride
I wanna see a condor type flat ride and spiral lift hill coaster
Please make a bobsled coaster
When they do waterparks... Imma buy that DLC right away. I love where this game is at already
Wow, scenario editor. This. Just. Got. Real.
Snakes? Did you say snakes?\n\nA standard. A symbol. Perhaps on a shield. Two snakes coming together... Facing each other! But they're one!
If you added a waterpark DLC, you could make a lot of money off of it.
I would love to see the Vekoma SLC, a Skyscraper Flat Ride, A natural Intamin Launch Coaster Like Kingda Ka, Stormrunner, and so on and a Coaster Train Like Intimidator 305
Im exited for cascade, but a bobsled coaster is still something im waiting for fronteir
We need the infinity coaster sooo bad
Make a update that you can controle the age of the coasters and rides
i really like the swastika ride
love it can't wait.. but will there ever be save path to blueprint ... that would be so awesome and would make it easier to snap an blueprint to the ground
Can't wait for the update, looks so freaking good:)
Can you please add a reguöar wild mouse, like the one at bakken in denmark
Who made planet coaster
REALEASE IT
Thank you! I as just starting a greece area in my park and I was complaining all the time that there's no water coaster!
Am I the only one who noticed the Shroom ride arms being the shape of a Swastika?
id love to play this in VR
This update looks interesting. I think the updates to staff management may be a little too complex, but I'll give it some time to see. Tables are an awesome idea, now I can make a themed, sit down cafe. Some updates I would like; The ability to explore your park as a guest (could work with vr), Water transport rides and other transport rides, and maybe some way to incorporate a hotel.\nOne thing I like over RCT3 is that guests factor in the transport rides when navigating to a ride. One complaint I have is the fireworks placement and sequencing. I prefer the old RCT3 sequencer and being able to place generic launchers and just place the various elements in them.  \nThis game is still very addicting, so keep up the good work.
Just read the comments and I haven't played the game yet so obviously I can't relate to the complaints, but this is a pleasant surprise because I was considering buying it and this is a nice push into wanting to buy it even more, thank you Planet Coaster :D
I will cry when we see the day when they finally add motion simulators
Free stuff? I love free stuff! Thank you so much, Frontier, for continuing to develop the game! :) Still so much love being thrown into this game and your other big projects!
I'd love to see sit-down restaurants where you can customise the layouts of tables and stuff, and also picnic areas for parks (families sat down on grass and stuff) haha I know these are pretty menial requests, but it would add such a level of immersion
I don't get it, it's frontier's game, they do what they want to do with it, it's free and fantastic, thank you frontier for giving us free updates and we love your game,
Good progress, getting the management side of things up is needed .. I would love too see you  guys increase the AI interaction priorities, have guests stop and interact more with each other and staff in random ways .. more random AI animations like stopping to take photos ... also have them use benches more diversly, rather than just go to closest bench.  Everyone walking around in a giant heard like zombies feels a bit weird.
Awesome features! I'd love to see a weather system.
Very nice stuff, reminds me the Theme Park and Theme Hospital era.  The next game will be the Planet Hospital? xD
Looks great, not much content though which I'm hoping means they are working on a water park expansion behind the scenes ;)
I always love the free updates it seems like some cool content in this one! I will also pay to see WATER PARKs please!?
yo when it showed the gient robot Phix made i immediately went to the steam workshop to download it
When is the release
When is the update coming out
this should have been named the round of applause panel
What happened to showing us a roadmap for future DLC and updates? Overall, like most have been saying, I feel like this updates a bit lackluster. However, I appreciate the free updates, and hope they continue!
Just a quick thing, I find the white background behind the speakers distracting... it's far to bright... the best moment was transfereging from a video back to the stage with a nice black background.
It would be cool to see the addition of track drop sections & track switches. pretty damn cool so far though.
I hope the rode is going to be a intamin launch
Doesn't that Wise Horn Canopy ride normally have more Hills in the circle? It seems so flat here. I remember as a kid there being more hills.\nLooking forward to the ability to change cars on tracks.
Is that the Star Wars kid?
For the peeps upset about the content.. I'm sure theres more than they previewed here.  The 1 year mark for this game is a big deal considering what it started out as. I'm sure the PC Team have a lot more in store to mark it.  I'm really excited to see the adjustments to staff management.  I hope that trend continues and we get a much more in depth management system delivered over the next year.  In all honesty, the management aspect of the game needs a lot of love. There is so much potential there.  Lets hope the next 12 months see the game move forward even more.
WOW that water coaster so nice
Frontier is awesome! Best developer in years.
Planet Coaster, when will this Update be released to the Public?
I would PAY PAY PAY for much more content. I want DLCs, Addons, ... love this game :-)
I'd happily pay another $30 USD for Waterparks. Fewer assets than Animals and Safaris plus I'd go back to playing the game again.
Did I miss when they said a date for it? Since it's anniversary does that mean it's coming in November?
Does anybody know if - and if yes, how - you can change the map size in the scenario editor?
Planet coaster: I am a big fan of Carnival flat rides and I was just wondering why no one has yet created the Double Farris Wheel that is usually seen at fair grounds?
I'm so thrilled to see you guys have made it this far. Your game is great and you all should be very proud.
Audio for Vocals is too Low and the Audio for Music too Loud.
I love the new water ride!
Glass, Swimming Pools & lots of Scaffolding... That's what I want.
WATERPARK DLC
AW HEELL YEUUUS ❤\n\nSo excited :D
Scenario Editoooor!!!! 🍾🍾👏🏻👏🏻🎉🎉
S&S space shot next please!
Add swimming pools please
Need more water park & zoo dlc like RCT 3.
Audio?
OMG YES! Water Coaster! Side-Friction Wooden Coaster! Changeable trains!
Scenario editor!!! DAY MADE!
Frontier, well done!!
wann werden den echte Glasscheiben entdeckt,oder erfunden??
We need waterparks!! (I'm frensh)\n;)
First I want to make a shoutout to the people who are making amazing Planet coaster content but are really struggling to get heard. Usually these so called ''featured creators'' get the majority of the attention. Who came up with that? It only encourages elitism.\n\nOkay, 1 new flat ride, 2 new coasters, a staff management building, picnic tables, scenario's and the ability to place different cars on same tracks. \nI'm so glad this update is free because just like the spooky pack, wich wasn't free... this is basic game content.\n\n Take picnic table for example, Zoo Tycoon 1 already had this feature and that game is 16 years old...\n\nScenario's. About time... I know many park simulation games wich already had this feature at the launch of the game.\n\n1 new flat ride and 2 new coasters. The coasters are nice. But i've expected more in terms of flatrides and track rides.\n\nI like the staff building, adds more realism to the game.\n\nPlacing different cars on same track. Good, a feature which screamed to be added.\n\nIt doesn't harm to be critical and we should not applaud every nack they add to the game that isn't really new and innovative.
go channel5gaming
why can't they make planet coaster free?
Okay, this would probably be a lot of work, but I had to get the idea out there before I forgot, anyway. \nMy idea is scripted live-action stunt shows, like the ones I've seen in every theme park ever. Wild-West shows, the pirate ship battle show, I've even seen a Batman one at Six Flags.\nThe base is a stage area, on which you can place scenery, and hired staff are actors in the show. You can create a script that the actors follow. Run here, shoot there, fall down onto airbag after being shot there... etc etc. I'm sure these guys could create amazing things with a tool like that in the game. \nAnd what park guest doesn't like to get off their feet and enjoy a show??\nI dunno, I think it would be awesome to see what people could create. The possibilities would be endless!!
I'd love to see functionality to make true racing coasters (synced-up parallel stations) or even functionality for track switches (taking cars off or adding cars to the track when rides get busy)
Those interesting name of those rides! How do you guys come up with the names of them?
You guys are doing such fantastic work after all this time. Thank you for bringing beauty and true creativity for tycoon games of this generation. :) I love this game so much and it has made me really get that enjoyment I use to have playing these games back in the day. Such talented and epic developers! THANK YOU!
I don't know if you guys will see this or not but I just want to say thank you so much for being, well honestly, the best dev team I have ever seen. You guys genuinely show concern about us players and that, to me, is the most important thing when dealing with consumers. Again, thank you for adding so much free content and showing the PC community how much you care!
I want the soaked DLC for Planet Coaster! ;P
Thank you so much Frontier for the staff management features! This is what I’ve been hoping for since I first heard about the game being developed!
With that matterhorn ride that is coming in the future, if I rode that in real life I would probably die from hyperventilation, because I would be worrying that I would run out of air.
I first bought this game last year, and somehow didnt like it, and gave it back via steam refund. Bought it again this year, and fell in love with it.... was it me who changed, or did the game change that much?
This game has amazing art and graphics, but i get bored with it fast. I think RCT3 is still more fun than this boring gameplay. Also I think the theft and vandalism thing sucks and should be able to be turned off in the settings.
A couple of in game scenarios would've been nice.
Are We Finally Getting Dynamic Weather after the billionth ask?!
All I want is to be able to build on the train station grid!
I still hype this game its such a great game. I hope you expand it even more with more content such as country based stuff for example Japan themed content :D
Still waiting for a fully-fledged expansion pack like water parks, zoos, or even dark rides.
I can't even play this game anymore :( takes too much to run it. I have a super good $2500 computer and I still can't run it
Why in the world would they have an Expo if they are not going to announce everything from an update that is only one month away? I feel bad for the people who wasted their money to go to that lame show.
That crowd is terrible! This people did all this work and people barely clapped! How dare they!
The coolest game ever \nBut I would like a PS4 version \nI don't know if it is possible but ...
Just glad it was streaming I would of been as excited as people in the room ( dead silent ) after the 3 things were announced yippee saved £ on this clowns blowing there own trumpet over Notting lol
Can you guys down at Frontier make a feature where you can disable the ride lights or at least change the color? The lack of that option kinda limits the the themes you can apply to rides with permanent colored lights...
I expected a bit more :( The water coaster is cool but i really don't care about the management stuff.
everyone needs to put her out of her misery and not vote for her to stay another week.
Why is this trending.
So glad Bruno backed Shirley Ballas and told Brendan where to shove it. Utterly disrespectful, he's always had such an anger problem.
Didn't enjoy this one. Charlotte just seemed awkward and uncomfortable through out. Also Brendan's comment was completely uncalled for. Well done to Bruno for calling him on it.
Firstly, Charlotte looks like a matured version of Taylor Swift. But quit trying to make her look sexy, Brendan. She's clearly not comfortable looking sexy. Somehow I felt she was not keeping to the steady tango walk (she went up and down against Brendan), I think she forgot to flex her knees. Not good still. 5
Charlotte doesn't have the technique or is even entertaining on the dance floor.... it's normal that her scores are low same with Ruth p.ex Susan may not be a great dancer but you can see she's enjoying herself..I much rather watch a bad happy dancer than a train wreck :(
Dragged from pillar to post... poor girl. Nerves again got the better of her I think. Could have been dynamic and staccato with the right paring...\n\nI just don't think they are gelling at all. Charlotte looked MORTIFIED when Brendan had a go at Shirley... Not nice to watch on an entertainment show. These two clearly have beef off-set. We the public don't want or need to see that.\n\nI hope they go tonight, getting unpleasant again (he was ott on 'It Takes Two' last week.) sadly and no-one should display the anger that Brendan did there... poor. Bring on Neil next year and get rid of Brendan.
I think that the judges were fair and there was no need for Brendan to answer back to the HEAD judge like that. He was just dragging her across the floor. I didn't like it
Yeah, that foxtrot seems a million miles away now. She's just getting shoved around. Also, shut up Brendan. 3.0/10
The judges were quite harsh, but Brendan had no excuse to act like such an ass. \nI don't think she's enjoying the competition at all, would probably be relieved to go out this week tbh.
She has no personality... Such a boring contestant..
terrble dragged around not good brendan was horrible to shirley 3/10
Can I get a thumbs up here folks? Hey @BBCStrictly - you know what makes for uncomfortable television? Not watching poor old Charlotte plod around the floor - but watching that angry, narcissist Brendan Cole. He can't take a woman judging him, especially one that knows more about dancing than he ever will and that also beat him to the judging position he wanted. He's rude, disrespectul, takes himself waaaay too seriously and should be warned that if he keeps this up he'll be off the show. Nobody wants to watch this angry man bring the show down. Tell him to shut it - or leave.
Ah yes, there is a little rise and fall towards the end. Not down low enough and she is an awkward, self conscious dancer but maybe she can improve.
Charlotte looked gorgeous but unfortunately she looked prettier then how she danced this was a hot mess 4/10
Unfortunately, this dance didn't suit her. Her posture and her frame were bad. Her footwork was bad - no heel leads at all. In addition, there was no emotion, she didn't portrayed the character of this dance... she looked  cold and even nervous.... the choreography was great, her musicality was excellent and her standing spin was very good, but the rest of the dance (in terms of hold, posture, technique and performance) were disappointing. A 5.
This had rise and fall, and her frame was not strong enough. 4/10.
Bloody hell people, what's the matter with you? This was a perfectly acceptable dance for week 2. She had a few moments of rise and fall, but it certainly wasn't as much as Shirley seemed to think. Brendan stuck up for Charlotte because Shirley crucified her dance when it wasn't deserved; she'd make marked improvements and had many good points to praise. It's clear that Charlotte lacks in confidence, and I feel that Shirley comments were more about knocking Brendan than they were about critiquing Charlotte. There were other pairs that night who were spoken to far more kindly than Charlotte was and her performance was far better. I think the judges sometimes forget that they are speaking to other adults, not children.
She didn't seem comfortable at all and there was almost no sticatto from Charlotte. She showed promise in Week 1, but I feel like she's only gonna shine in those Waltz-esque dances.\n\n4/10
Awful he had to drag her to keep her frame up . And Brendan giving flack to Shirley since she started can he not take being judged by a woman? His snarky comments help no one especially Charlotte
1 am not an expert but i know what rise and fall is (as in waltz) and, after re-watching dance,  gemma did not do it.. \nIn spins and 'poses' she was 'taller' and if you look is spins on the balls of her feet and she IS TALL so she rose but that is not rise and fall.\nI have no complaint with brendan standing up for her, \ni have no complaint about the fact gemma was pulled and pushed throughout the dance and was generally bad but it was better than week one\ni am annoyed this issue was not mentioned/handled in the Sunday show - that was a disgrace\nIf professionals cannot defend their partners then make that a scd rule and keep all professionals silent as judges make they comments.\nas for being too competitive - they all are - pro and celeb - they all want to win and be correctly critiqued
she looks gorgeous every week but my guess is she was terrified again because she looked joyless out there :(
Terrible dance and she's getting dragged across the floor! Also Brendan's attitude needs to be sorted, it's a competition but at the end of the day it's a bit of fun. He takes it too seriously, that's not what dancing is about!
Feel like Charlotte and Brendan don't get along... he takes it way to seriously and needs to relax a bit.  You can tell she is so tense especially when getting the scores
Brendan needs to learn to shut his mouth
Brendan was disrespectful to Shirley. His choreography is not really that good nor is his teaching style. Remember what happened with Anastasia? He just couldn’t choreograph something that would make her shine or teach her basics. He gets sick and in come Gorka. He taught her and choreographed a beautiful routine which was her highest score. Brendan returns and they get eliminated. I think it’s time for him to go
Brendan had a right to stick up for his partner.its only week three she never danced before(unlike some people on the show )u can tell sheirly dosnt like Brendan tentoin onto nights show proves it. Well done u to u can improve each week.xx
WHO IS HERE JUST TO SEE IF SHIRLEY WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE RISE AND FALL LOL
I think that Shirley was too harsh. What she said was right but she talks to some in a rude way rather than a constructive way! Brendan was a bit quick to argue back but I think he could hear the way she talks to others in comparison to the way she talks to charlotte and I'm not surprised he was angry! Charlotte was nervous and clearly just needed someone to acknowledge her efforts rather than just lay into her. It is only week 3
I can understand why the rise and fall was there. If you look closely, you can see it's because she keeps quite low while moving in hold. When she straightens up in the dance to pose and because of her height it looks like a rise. I think Shirley is waay too harsh.
this is disappointing i thought after her first dance she showed promise and potential but these last 2 dances have not been good she's in danger tomorrow i think Charlotte and Rev Richard will be in the dance off
Who?
Poor dancer..
Are we still doing phrasing?!
She looks REALLY uncomftable
DANGER ZONE!!!
Welcome back old Brendan! We didn't miss you.
That new judge is awful, she needs to be aware she is addressing the public, she has no respect from me, we know she knows her dancing and steps we do not want to hear it. She caused Brendan to react to her. NO professional judge should cause that. It is totally uncalled for her to make Brendan have to point out her mistake.To be honest I am fed up with Bruno shoving himself about I just wish he's wack that judge and shut her up. Bad move stricktly we do not like her.\n Brendan they do not need to tell you about dancing you are a professional judge yourself and this is week three.You did great getting Charlotte to come back.Try and let her make her own mistakes she is good and it will show. Don't rise to that nasty judge she is an embarassment to Strictly
Why the fluff is this 11 on trending
If this was a dance that required 'Rise and Fall' the judges would probably have said that it was non existent. Bruno is the arch exponent of rise and fall,  he can barely keep his posterior positioned on his chair.
i'm going to be generous with my remarks here. Charlotte definitely gets nervous beforehand and that affects her ability to dance. I think she played the character of the Tango very well actually. my mark - 6.
A nice girl but a little stiff in the hips.
The thing with Shirley is that I am actually learning about the dances. I like the detail she puts into her critiques. Brendan really just needs to remind himself it's Sat night tv. Laugh it off like Anton. He's making it hard for Charlotte to enjoy herself. She just looks scared and non enthused and unlike the second shooter you cannot debate the fact that there WAS rise and bloody fall!!!
This woman can't dance
She needs to feel more comfortable with Brendan, trust him and let him lead! Good week 1, but there is more improvement needed. 4/10
If she isn't in the dance off she needs to come back strong better than last week but not good enough that motorbike looks expensive, 5
Wow nice cute but the best
Poor Charlotte, looks so uncomfortable when Brandon back talks Shirley. She has a higher status than you, do not have a go at someone who clearly knows what their talking about
Clear rise and fall - you don’t need to be a dance expert to be able to see that (and I’m not) - the judges were right, Brendan!!
Surprising, if disappointing, lack of Archer related comments...
Well done Brendan for sticking up for your lady in a respectful way.  Shirley was unkind and Bruno joining in just made him look like a  bully
yasss the old Brendan is back
As a dancer Charlotte is being throne round by Brendon because she is doing everything really bad like her frame no offence but also Brendon was very rude to the judges !
She’s just shit
Charlotte looks like  a homeless Taylor swift
They're through for another week
Charlotte gets nervous ,she looked great,but I bet she doesn't like showing so much flesh..that effects her dance routines..I thought harshly marked as much improvement...up to judges to give her confidence not tear into her.judges you can tell have their favourites...strictly possibly coming to the end of its run now!
Hm, I did like it though. Wasn't the best dance ever of course. But still enjoyable. I think the judges votes for them are more of a personal vote than a professional vote. They are really harsh on Charlotte.....
Beauty... But dead behind the eyes
Gosh i want her out, she's just not good
No sense of rhythm.
Mr I Fancy Myself Strikes again I really hate him
Why is this on trending? #8
Brandon is known to be hotheaded but for her sake he needs to be carafull. It's all about her, not him.
Why the hell is this trending?
The problem with Brendan is that he is insufferable. Even if he is part of s fantastic dance I still don’t enjoy it.
Change of the jacket and these two could easily play sandy and Danny 💙
I congratulate her on coming back from last week's display, but the potential of her Foxtrot in week 1 is becoming a distant memory.If she survives this week, I hope she starts a) enjoying herself and b)discovering some performance skills and characterisation-I think that would help her actually and Brendan for that matter.
better than last week but there is still room for improvement
A little improvement. Needs a little bit more improvement to get to week 4. 3
She should have gone home, just doesn't seem to care and no effort is shown, this dance would have been amazing if it was someone else
She is so graceful, but he pushes her about too much and makes the dance about himself. The dance would be much less stunted if he wasn’t pushing her around. Also do keep your mouth shut Brendan. You are the most unpleasant dancer we’ve had on strictly, and you have no right to try and correct a judge, especially Shirley, head judge. Well done to Bruno to putting you in your place.
I'm surprised Brendan is still on the show as I don't think he has the spirit of it- too serious
I do see where everyone is coming from but brendon is just saying what he has to say because most peole just smile and nod their heads but i surpose everyone was being harah except charlotte
Charlotte is like a mannequin.
i like Charlotte...but my God...she is awful
Disaster, Charlotte is way too far to the right of Brendan which is distorting the frame. This seems like a rushed job as she appeases to be skipping along the floor which is creating the illusion that they’re using rise and fall which is not the way a tango should be done... Totally agree with Shirley. I score this a 3.
Brendan shouldn't have said there was no rise and fall until he'd watched the dance back. He'd made himself look a bit of an idiot after a few million of us had watched Charlotte rising and falling .....
I wish the judges would stop being so harsh and having favourites!!! The dance was brilliant - I enjoyed it and I'm sure all #TeamCharcole fans enjoyed it as well!
I protect these two so much, Shirley may have been right about the rise and fall but no need to tear the poor girl to shreds. Feel like the judges have it in for team Charcole, Craig was actually the nicest! Well, despite it being 3rd from bottom, a HUGE improvement on last week, well done! Just keep building that confidence up, fingers crossed for team Charcole!
Most gallant of Brendan to defend his partner.  Especially considering that the head judge has a tendency to mark down the female contestants.
Wasn't impressed last week but was a big improvement however the judges were too harsh on Brendan but his comments weren't appreciated\n5
I'm disappointed. I said she'll pull it back with some ballroom this week, guess I was wrong. She could be in trouble. Not good. 4.
Brendon said he messed up....where in the routine did he mess up?
I'm actually on Brendan's side with the whole Brendan and Shirley conflict! I like how he defends himself. Not a huge fan of Shirley
What's a rise and fall?
How is this trending 😂😂
I don't see why people keep on hating on her 🤔 I know she's not the greatest dancer there but can't u see the improvement from last week. Brendon's answering back has just ruined it for her Because now she's caught up between the judges and Brendon disagreement .From now on I'm only expecting low scores and I literally feel so sorry for her 😩😭.i just hope that the judges give her a chance to boost her confidence like how she was like at the beginning of the show
Trending? More like Tossed money at YouTube.\n\nYou really expect us to believe that this video that hasn't even hit 100k views in over a day is trending?\n\nGeeze just make a tab called  'Paid Promotions' please.
I'm seriously annoyed with Brendan acting like that, saying Shirley doesn't know what she's talking about, but I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.
Wooden horse comes to mind
She’s hurtin’ for a squirtin’
Someone please explain what rise and fall is?!?!?!
Who else realises that Brendan has to make a speech every time him and his partner get slightly bad comments? - I can't be the only one. Right?\n\nBrendan was of course lying - that or he's a very bad choreographer. It had loads of rise and fall.
I no longer live where I can watch this live and am limited to the videos that are posted here on youtube.  A lot of the comments mention Brendan's comments.  What happened???
I apologize. Even though I'm a huge fan of the show, I don't know a lot about techniques of dancing and their names. What is a rise and fall? :)
What a shit referee. Is he Scottish?
Кто то поставил хату букмеккерам на то, что в матче не будет пенки
сварить на мыло и отмывать этим мылом стадион и другие помещения от плевков болельщиков.
Loved the video, would love to connect!
Not complaining when such officiation leads to an England world cup win (y)
In the words of Mr Bean,\n\nmish mish mish mish mish mish mish mish mish
Can anyone translate what he's saying?
That's one dodgy referee.  Some pass from the guy though.
Penalty! And another penalty! Oh wait.
If you ever saw a referee that has been bribed, this is one .
What a disgrace!! Kudos to the reporter by making this public with walking away. This referee should be banned for life and heavily fined as a lesson for anyone who dares to take sides while officiating. The match has to be repeated.
this is literally the worst referee EVER
Wow! Should be sacked and given an eye test
Don't mind me. just an English comment coming through
Read about this on BBC 😂😂
Fire that referees ass for match fixing
Wow! Fixed or just thick as fuck?
First one was a clear dive by the attacker beside the corner flag. Second the defender clearly kicks the ball away. I see no issues here.
Calm down dear, its a bloody football match!!!
It's pretty clear that the referee has given the free kick for the goalkeeper handling the ball outside of the penalty area. Whether it should have been a penalty is another matter! As for the subsequent handball - yep - he's missed a sitter.
In communist Russia, you supply commentary.
who's here after bbcnews?
Was the referee a coward (scared) or bribed? The goal keeper clearly committed a foul in the goal area and it was seen by the referee, and it should have been a penalty and the keeper should have been shown the 'Red Card'. This does not look good for the reputation of all match officials.
The ref got the decision correct! The free kick is for handball outside the area. There was no penalty as the forward was not fouled. He went down looking for the penalty with minimal contact.
Watch this at .25 speed. The referee was correct not to give a penalty. The attacking player runs into the goalkeeper, not the other way round. The keeper's eyes are on the ball at all times. The attacker is deliberately looking for a penalty and if anything should have been given a yellow card for simulation. The referee gave a free kick for handball to the attacking side but could easily have awarded a free kick to the defending side.
The free kick was given for goalkeeper handball outside of the box, NOT the foul in the box.\nHowever I cannot see explanation for the second handball from the free kick not being given.
Всем на столько все очевидно и все такие эксперты футбола.... Вот запись с другого ракурса https://youtu.be/T_sUxdRXdmw?t=609 \nНу и с Никольским, это не первый скандал, ему уже приходилось  публично извиняться за мат в прямом эфире в адрес соперника - https://provladimir.ru/news/shortnews/kommentator-torpedo-izvinilsya-za-oskorblenie-trenera-spartaka-iz-kostromy\nУ той же Казанки были претензии к данному персонажу.
Судья-пидорас,чоуж.)
Жора Черданцев отдыхает)))...а если серьёзно - это налицо результат работы Фонбетов, Винлайнов, Лиги ставок и прочих многочисленных контор...деньги правят футболом...даже во Владимире (или в Иваново)...и это печально
Ещё бы пенальти ставить в 2017 году!
Очевидно что комментатор под чем-то. Жаль, что эти бесполезные уёбки занимают места, на которых могли бы работать люди, которые хотят комментировать, а не исполнять вот эти цирковые номера. Пенальти на усмотрение судьи. Я видел, что полевой игрок подставился под вратаря, блокируя ему дорогу - такие приёмы разрешены в хоккее, в футболе это трактуется в пользу вратаря. Комментатор - бесталанный уёбок, надеюсь этот мудак не будет больше засирать эфир своими воплями дикобраза, которого только то сняли с самки.
Комментатор истиричка
Почему молчит Российский футбольный совет?!
А теперь самое главное,запомните фамилию этого судьи,МИ-РО-ШНИ-ЧЕН-КО...Верх КОРРУПЦИИ всего судейского корпуса и цинизма....
ну если первое нарушение сомнительное если честно игрок явно подставлялся ,а вратарь тупо бежал с задратой вверх головой и сбил его тоесть еще можно поспорить,но когда защитник выносит мяч с штрафной ДВУМЯ руками -это жесть судью на мыло!
Ну судья явно работает не только за зарплату...А комментатор прав, чем такое комментировать, лучше другую работу найти. Я бы тоже ушел).
ههههههههههههه
Судью надо отправить судить матчи чемпионата мира!
HHHHHHHHHHHH
какой нах футбол в раше, готовьтесь к труду и обороне, мля, путлер укажет путь еще на лет 20
Комментатор просто работает в Торпедо
Ребята, ну вот есть же Шакуров о сборной (полная версия БЕЗ ЦЕНЗУРЫ).\nЗдесь всё сказано. И закрыть нужно эту тему (вместе с футболом естественно).
Некоторые пишут , что позор комментатору. Если бы не он, то никто бы так и не узнал о таком моменте и полной деквалификации судьи.
что за кривоногие и долбаебы судьи ?
Ну хоть что-то в нашем Владимире происходит
забавно, он сразу на точку указал, а потом поменял решение на штрафной
Комментатор : пресс-атташе ФК Торпедо (Владиир).
обычный договорняк,игрок сыграл руками,сделал это сознательно,про не назначенный пенальти я уже молчу,неужели кто то еще болеет за такое.Одним словом днище
государство не содержит футбольные команды, они принадлежат частникам :) Государство строит только стадионы, которые потом сдает в аренду футбольным клубам, так что налогов граждан РФ в существовании футбольных клубов НЕТ:) В СССР футбольные клубы были на содержании у государства, но вы же захотели профессиональный футбол, вот и кушайте его.
Посмотрел несколько раз — с этого ракурса и расстояния, я не увидел нарушения со стороны вратаря ( при борьбе за мяч ). Штрафной за игру руками — да, можно и карточку было дать. Во втором эпизоде: — он не играл рукой, а закрывался от удара
Бомбонуло у коментатора жостко!
Я надеюсь судья как минимум уже ничего не судит?
Какая страна такой и футбол
комментатор идиот!
Лучше хоккей играйте !!!
я один заметил что нет болейшиков
порядочный коментатор
комментатор-огонь!!! он лучший! не то что тухлые с матч тв
Такое ощущение, что даже нарушивший голкипер показывал судье, что там пенка. А потом защ специально руками сыграл, чтобы хоть так пенку дали. Но судья был невозмутим ))
Not surprised, blatent pen tbf.
чтоб бля он в аду горел, пидорас  мирошниченко, а его жена в бедности жила и  сосала на хлеб.
Это позор комментатора,что бы не происходило ОН ОБЯЗАН вести себя профессионально, какое не было бы решение, а он повел себя как истеричная тёлка которой что то не понравилось...Надеюсь его уволят...
Доскакались на майдане кацапи .Позор мірошнику.Смерть ворогам
дайте угадаю: Мутко молчит с невинным ебалом.
СУДЬЮ НА КУЙ ИЗ СПОРТА ПОЖИЗНЕННО!
Can anyone please translate?
Вратары поймал мячь за переделами своего ринга \n Из за этого судья не дал пеналти  А дуругой игрок зашишал груд
Судью дисквалифицировать. Комментатору- респект. У нас футбол итак то не футбол, а корявая ходьба за мячом, а тут ещё и эти ублюдыши со (свистками) встревают. Хатьфу
В первом случае пенальти не было - игрок видя, что проигрывает эпизод подставился под вратаря.\nА вот во втором случае 100% пенальти.\nКомментатор - истеричка, парень абсолютно не на своем месте
Конечно у комментатора накипело
Долбоебы со своим футболом все носятся
Как и вся Россия. Как и все судьи в судах.
bloody hell
Referee should be lynched.  Awful
ты чё тваришшшш
Когда вот так и Орлов уйдет во время трансляции ?)))
Молодец! Человек с позицией.
Зачем вообще нужен этот футбол? Давно пора киберспортом заниматься.
Мирошниченко пидор заряженный!!!!
ахаха еблан куплен на все 100
Надеюсь, это последний матч этого арбитра в его профессиональной карьере.
Будни параши во всей красе.
Цирк
Это какая лига???
5 ысяч ублей!
чем закончилась матч
Респект коментатору!
у судьи ставка горит)))
Кто выиграл то в итоге?
*2:15
нууу, так то он прав
РУКА!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Это Россия
Komentator je u pravu i ja bi otisao
LOL He is so right. A lot of things have to change in football referees.
комментатор мужик! респект тебе!
Там явных нарушений нет, судья матча виноват лишь в том, что хотел судить как в Премьер лиге. Ахахахаха) Пенальти! Пенальти мать твою. Позор игроку, который лег под вратаря, а во втором, мяч все равно летел в живот, а попал в руки прижатые  к животу. Позор тем кто так отреагировал бурно. Это футбол друзья, и в обоих случаях на усмотрение судьи.
истеричка, очень непрофессионально.
коментатор ты че визжишь как барышня ??? или ты владимирское терпило по жизни визжать ??? первый эпизод ИГРА РУКОЙ ВРАТАРЕМ ЗА ПРЕДЕЛАМИ ШТРАФНОЙ ПЛОЩАДКИ !!!! КАКОЙ МОЖЕТ БЫТЬ ПЕНАЛЬТИ ИДИОТ ??? УЧИ ПРАВИЛА.. ПРЕЖДЕ ЧЕМ ВАРЕЖКУ ОТКРЫВАТЬ !!!! А то что ты завизжал ПЕНАЛЬТИ со своей колокольни. то это не означает что голкипер снес игрока в штрафной !!!!там была борьба и нарушения я не усмотрел в этом эпизоде. а то что назначен штрафной. то посмотри внимательно. вратарь за ленточку с мячом не переехал !!!! так что все в тему. и по игре
Хуле, кацапстан
I wish there was more content on YouTube like this.
this video brought to you by paper please
6:15 George says ZEE-ECKS Spectrum and every Brit in the audience spontaneously bursts a blood vessel.
please make more of these
Check out Noclip Witcher series, shows how CD Projekt started importing and localizing in soviet Poland
Polyplay... German company... polyplay... commissioned by the governmetn to manipulate the masses... polyplay... polybius ?
The animation is amazing and I love it.
Nice, some German history beside the obvious one.
There is something that makes no sense, a underlined fact that makes no sense. If you're going to have some crazy half step embargo against basically any kind of electrical based tech, why have electricity at all. It would all and all lead to a better life ingeneral without electricity, the only thing electricity does outside of entertainment is make people lazy POS, so basically baring electric entertainment based tech, makes having electricity at all pointless.
What music begins playing at 28 seconds?
If ever someone says Communism is the best thing ever, point them towards East Germany... that might shut them up for a few minutes until they start saying But it just hasn't been done right yet!
my new fav video on this channel.  :)
Whats the music in the first 10 seconds I recognise it from somewhere.
I fist-pumped at the noodle shot.
Great video again! Youre basically doing same quality of content as NoClip, but with more oddball, yet interesting topics.\n\nDDR was pretty similar to what it was like in Czechoslovakia too (later on Czech and Slovak Republics). Its kinda suprising that you dont reference the lack of Intellectual Property laws and how theyve affected opinions on piracy. So in short for the people from outside of central and eastern europe: Imagine 80s and 90s with no NES, SNES, Mega Drive etc., except for occasional knockoffs and lack of willingness to pay for any software :).
8:08 thanks for the fan service george
This story is a jewel. I have researched the history of computing in the Warsaw Pact countries and it is wonderful to see the quality of this work. I am grateful. Thank you very much.
7 minutes in and I still don't see the point this video is trying to make...
The animations were my favourite part, Dad Gorg continues to raise the bar for everyone.
Great, informative video! In Finland, we also had commodore programs broadcast over the radio so you could record it on a cassette.
I come close from Koblenz and i wondered why i could never find a NES. gameboy. SNES or any other console/pc on a fleamarket.\nThey didn't have that shit lol.
I dig the sad Tetris theme
It is shocking that East Germany were way behind Poland (my homeland country neighboring with former East Germany) in video games field. In Poland were not produced home computers in late 80' nevertheless they were imported from West Germany (Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and later Amiga). At these times on flea markets you could get many games (of course pirated but back then in Poland were not defined anti-piracy law) therefore we could play many different games from the west. In Poland video game consoles became popular in early 90' when communism was overthrown and one of Polish company imported Taiwan famiclones (Famicom/NES clone) known today as Pegasus. To be honest I miss these days, it was really good times.
It depresses me to know that my parents and other relatives back in Romania had to live and grow up under these conditions and I only narrowly avoided being born under Communism.
But games aren't political though.
What is this? WHAT IS THIS!?? An American talking about something from beyond the Iron Curtain? And doing proper research on it? And presenting it in a bearable manner? my compliments go to that!\n\nWhen I clicked on the video I seriously expected it will be all like HUHUH, they didnt have NENTENDUH, HUHUH, they suck!
I loved the music choices in this vid. And this was a very interesting topic.
That's some great parents.
Okay, seriously, why didn't it show up in my subscription box despite me having you subbed and the bell on?
Great video as always George. I saw a cip from  Curse of the grey elephant at 6:40, did you watched it? Because i would be interested in your thoughts about it.
I spat my drink out when he pronounced comparison , instead of comparishon*
Surely Michael Gorbachev takes some credit for the wall?
imagine the games we could create if east germany rose again\nI'd be the leader of the new gdr and I'd allow war games as long as they where through perspective of eastern countries
Your videos keep making this political scientist smile. Keep up the good work
When it worked.\n\nIt never worked. That's why the lines and the poverty were so different when the unification happened.
But nintendo is eastern.
So this might be an influence to why Yager made the most prolific anti-war war game to date?
I had never thought of, or even thought to think of, gaming in the Eastern Bloc.\nExcellent topic choice, and as usual, excellent video.\nThank you for this!
That museum was very cool. Really liked seeing the old games and tech.
lol, my mum didn't see a pineapple till she was 18, let alone video games
I visited the museum last year with my college class it was extremely interesting(The pain station was the center piece of our whole time there, did you play it bunny?) but they never quite went into how the machines etc. were programmed that was very interesting finding it out from this video. \nDid you manage to get to the DDR museum bunny? I found it very interesting as well.
Haha communism really suck. It will never work out, ever.
I strongly recommend to the people who liked this video to watch the Dendy russian video about an angry russian dude (acting like the AVGN) talking about his childhood playing those NES knockoffs and ports of newer games on that nes hardware. It's very interesting and fun to watch!
was fun to hear about my  homeland on this channel ^.^
This is one of many reasons as to why I do not support Socialism/Marxism
Born in the GDR in 1981, I am one of those people who suffered from the lack of video games in the early childhood. My first and only gaming experience before the fall of the iron curtain was a few minutes of River Raid (shown in this video). Even after the reunion it took me a little while (christmas 1991 to be exact) to get my first console (the SEGA Master System), because money was short for most former eastern germans and electronic was very expensive (an empty cassette tape for example costed 20 Mark which is around 40-50$ by today's standard) . For a whole year I had only Alex Kidd and Sonic to play, followed by Sonic 2 the next christmas. I'm not really sad about it because I learned to appreciate what I had instead of being jealous of what others had. It had a unique kind of fascination to try out a new game back then and that's what I'm missing today.\nAfter all I (and the former GDR in general) quickly caught up with the latest technology and by the time the fifth generation of video games (N64, Playstation, Saturn) came we were on the same level as the rest of the world, if not earlier.\nWe may have missed some precious childhood experiences back then, but we also learned to respect video games in a way most people didn't :)
And that's why I dislike communism.
Everytime governments think they've controlled markets, people make their choices anyway. This is why black markets exist.
If only communism would've actually been a good way to run a country and not make everyone hate it and want to leave, because ultimately it's not in our nature to behave that way.\nI was born way past that time, but it does sound like a fucking nightmare. By the by, I never learned stuff like this in school. All we ever talked about was how bad Hitler was and nothing else, like what our country was actually like.
With people even resorting to broadcasting source code to each other over the radio... \n\nLook at what lengths these people went to make games work back then! Meanwhile publishers like 2K can't be bothered to get 2K18 under freaking 16 GB for the Switch...
btw dendy is a chinese system and was simultaneously on market with sega16bit and ps1 (n64 and snes too but no one ever cared about nintendo)
wow this video made it into youtube's trending, well deserved in my opinion
This is also the case in all of the former soviet bloc countries. Taping software/games on cassettes in order to share them to the few people who had some sort of bootleg commodore 64 was common practice.
I am glad that Marxism did not prevail in the free world.
The Stasi secret police museum is actually not very far away from the video game museum. It's 10 minutes on the train system they have there.
It's not that related to the topic at hand, but that museum is great. In there you can have a chat with one of the first chat bots called Eliza, created in the 60-s. When I was there I told it it's 2014 and it told me I'm insane.\n\nThey also have the weirdest arcade pong machine called Pain station. You move the bar by rotating an analog tumbler with your right hand, while your left hand is pressed against a metal grate with electric contacts. If you take your left hand off that grate, you lose. The gist is - every time you miss a ball, random danger zones appear on the screen. If your opponent, who is in a same position as you, hurls the ball into those zones, your left hand gets either slapped with a thick rubber band, heated with really hot air or zapped through the contacts. We've had enough after like 5 minutes. The record holder, as we were told, has managed to endure this for several hours.
amazing ingenuinity on part of east german programmers, even if their gaming industry never kicked off\nimagine playing western games for hours so that you can make your own copy from scratch and discussing coding with other programmers through (non-electronic) mail\nhats off to people like andre weißflog
Channels like this are making youtube more serious planform than a national tv. But than again there are much more stupid stuff on youtube.
1:06 I live in berlin and never knew about this sooooo....yeah ;)
Thank you great video. Much needed.  We are still susceptible to the temptations and failed promises of socialism.
Man.. I can't watch this anymore. It's too depressing.
This is 44th in trending right now.\nNever expected you to be there but I'm glad nonetheless, great video George.\nBut when's next TOVG podcast bruh?
Sounds like current year gaming politics.
4:45 very interested in this but I'm having trouble finding more info about having software on a vinyl disc.
Dude, you really have a lot of talent. As cliche as it sounds, this really has a lot of meaning in the scientific community as it stands in america. The government holding back its citizens in scientific discovery is mind boggling.
Thats a new subject matter. DANKA  I am makeing subscrib to wonderful YouTubes channel.
How can Cloth Map be making 16 grand a month to visit Eurovision and you're hear making amazing content like this and selling George Socks to survive?
Eastern European countries actually were making imitations of zx spectrum (commodore) and we had them all over the USSR in the 80s. We had all the games on pirated cassette tapes sold all over the street markets.
I think your video is on trending, at least on mine it seems. \n\nGood to see hard work pay off.
I wish I were employed and not just an intern, to support you on Patreon >_> Hopefully I can do it in the future, you totally deserve it!
Makes me feel blessed to live in a time where I can buy any pc or console and any game for it...
The Soviets were going to make a Nintendo knockoff called the Dendy?\nNot the Денде?\nI'm not doubting you at all, but that is so weird...
Your work is so good and very appreciated.
Now I want to see a period film about a ragtag but lovable group of young game devs living behind the iron curtain in the 80s
Holy shit my boy bunnyhop made trending? So cool to see!
When people conplain about gaming being addictive, violent, sexist and other sorts of things, I think they are the offspring of those Communists with ideologies that just don't make any real sense when there are so many serious stuff in the real world but they get so offended by works of fiction it is a strange comparison.\n\nSure even capitalist countries got worried about violence in gaming, but allot of those who were worried have deep communist beliefs how everything needed to be done to their standards that were often unrealistic.
This video was ..... really cool
I need to work on german subtitles for this video ASAP. My family comes from East Germany and I bet my mum would love to watch the video! Problem is; her english is terrible, she wouldn't understand most of this.
and people still insist socialism is the way to go..
The Hudson river, two years ago...
Hi, German here. What do you mean by Hasselhof was not responsible for tearing down the wall?
You've got to wonder sometimes.\nPart of the Soviet Block's problems were just a severe lack of industrial capacity.\n\nAround the time Communism took hold, if you compare Russia to the United states, one has massive amounts of industrial infrastructure, the other is still dominated by rural farmland and relatively little industry to speak of.\n\nYou might think it sad that all they managed is inferior knock-offs of western computer technology, but when you really stop and think about it, the fact that they could build semi-decent clones of this stuff at all was a major accomplishment in it's own right.\n\nComputer technology requires a LOT of resources to do effectively.\nSo much so that the most critical components are the product of maybe a half dozen factories at most.\nAn earthquake in a single country a decade or so ago, which crippled only one or two factories was enough to cut the global supply of RAM chips by 30%\n\nEast German computers huh.\n\nI guess given those restrictions, if you had the connections and wealth to get a machine imported in the late 80's it seems pretty clear to me you'd want an Amiga;\nSince you weren't allowed to have software... Yeah, that seems like the most impressive thing you could get if you had to make all your own software and tools for it...
Thank you for making a video about this topic. I legitimately had no idea about this, and I find this utterly fascinating. I'm so glad that you still make amazing videos after all this time being subscribed to you. Cheers!
Who are you, Drew Scanlines?
Amazing work George.
Man socialism sounds fun.
Great vid, interesting topic, well made.Liked, subbed and notified
Hey, greetings from Berlin! :-) Nice video!
4:11 *HEEEHEHEHEHEE! MY MAN!*
great video
This is right-wing propaganda!!!!!!
damn starting with mgs3 huh
NOOOOOOOOOOOODDLLEEEEEEEESSSS!!!!
Ui, ich wusste nicht, dass Sie deutsch sprechen können!
Trending. Nice job George!
#43 on Trending. Nice!
GEORGE on TRENDING!?
communism/socialism is cancer
ICH BIN EINE GAMER!
Living in an Actual Communist Country, I can say a computer/laptop/video game console is worth several months of complete salaries. A desktop computer like 8-14 months, a laptop 3-20 months, VG console 12-13 months
Enjoy the Trailer for Pacific Rim 2
It seems like everyone is complaining about the music and shit. You haven't seen the movie yet. You cannot judge a book by its cover. To my honestly it looks pretty cool. I got a bit hyped when I saw the ad but skipped it cause I wasn't paying attention. But I think it looks pretty good, I like to watch giant things kill other giant things. Feel free to disagree but I plan on watching it cause the first movie was so cool. And I don't really care what you have to say. Let the results show when it comes out and see how many liked it and how many diskliked it. By far I'm seeing a tad bit racistem, judging, hating, and some even say they rip off of transformers. That sorta made me laugh. I know y'all prob not gonna watch it but I'm going to be the one who does. I like it cause it looks cool. The whip and swords. The monsters/ aliens and the robots. I'm a big fan of that stuff. So I'm excited for next year. I don't care about the music all I care is if it looks good enough. I'll watch it. And since I watched the first one and liked it. I'm sure as hell gonna like this one because well you know.. I like giant robots fight monsters/ aliens. So later people I'll be looking forward for this movie.
it's just looks like megazord lol
MEh.......I think I wait for the Godzilla King of Monsters movie...
the most dumbest awesome movie ever or the most awesome dumbest movie ever?
i like the robot in previews film
you can stop worrying about grenades now
What is a jaeger\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's an eva
Wow so nice I’ll waiting it and look it better then part I
If you are reading this comment your parent will die within 5 years. To undo the curse copy this comment to 5 videos.Good Luck
why do they have to blackify everything good.
For the guitar riff, is that an actual song or is it just a riff for the movie
Why does every movie that comes out now have to have either a black guy or a woman as the hero?? It is getting fucking old and not believable. Oh and fucking teens driving huge robots.
0:55  gypsy danger from the first film looks WAY better
dude do you hear the music? it says DILDOOO THAT I GOT DILDOOO THAT I GOT
0:57 What do they say? Is it Born Ready?
A must see movie. :)
Some people saying it look trash but I'd like to see the make a movie with more animation than this..💯💯
John Boyega is the MAN....Cartoon graphics aside, this will be fun, just not fun as the original cuz guillermo del toro aint involved this time oh well....
I'm a bit confused...why do people hate the trailer and say it's shit...is it the music...the cast...the fact that it has more black and female characters? I personally think this trailer looks good. The Jaegers don't looks like cartoons. I see a lot of people saying it going to be nothing like the original...in this trailer I see big ass robots fighting big ass aliens...also just because 2 Jaegers are  red and orange doesn't make them toys.
That's right. Cast a mouth-breathing ape-nosed dirty nigger as lead in my favourite movie.
well people, looks like we have another transformers situation on our hands. Transformers part 1 Awesome, part 2 ass, part 3 asser?
The end, I saw the movie bc of this spoiler trailer
People say its shit but did u watch the furst movie. no then
The amount of extremely negative, racist, cruel comments on a 3 minute trailer are amazing. I think many of you take pleasure in ripping anything you see online to shreds.
i wish gipsy had the same pilots :(
Still think the first Percific Rim was the best
Those Jeagars should not be shiny and jumping around. They're meant to be inefficient last resort war engines which are dark and gritty. Armored to the point of sacrificing mobility to endure the Kaiju. What is this power ranger shit.
The 1st film was good, I've got a feeling this next instalment,won't be as good
THIS IS FANTASTIC AND EXTRODINARY AND FABULOUS. I don't know why people dislike this
Is it me or at 2:32, it sounds like glados from portal
This looks like shit. Plus, why are these jaegers so mich smaller than the original
there turning this movie into fatastic 4 jaeger version
So movie 1 they had GREAT theme music. Now with movie 2 we'll get some talentless rapper to scream some bullshit half on the beat.\n\nMovie 1 had good CGI. With movie 2 it looks like they cut the budget in half.\n\nMovie 1 had a good sense of desperation with the aliens overwhelming Earth in a war of economical attrition. Movie 2 will go the Dragonball Z way of exagerating to the point where it will be unrealistic and it will be ridiculous.
Can't wait for this movie to flop. Looks like crap compared to the excellent original.
Wtf we have moved from hunnam to these kids?
I loved the colors of the last movie. Pitch blacks agains vibrate colors. I dont see that in this one but hopefully this is just in the trailer and the movie will be different. Either way, if i die, i hope it's after this movie comes out.
Black guy British accent \nTupac rappen in background just dosent go maybe weather man in  cant take hime seriously.
Too cliche. These robots are gonna do what what robots always do whenever they are outmatched by a much larger kaiju. The question is... which ones will form the arms and legs... and which gets to be the torso?
so which jaeger has the portal gun?
at least I can understand what's going on
Got more excited about this than with any transformers movie...
Got a trailer for Pacific rim two, whilst watching a trailer for Pacific rim two, what does this mean?
I just had the Pacific rim trailer on Pacific rim trailer
Fucking bulshit I am not gonna watch this movie. Very bad cast and the robots look like a fucking mix between transformers and power rangers. I am so disappointed
Movie looks OK... hope the soundtrack is better than that  piece of shit on the trailer
Look like tranformers 6 @@! Hey Michael Bay, are you there??
Is the Glados from portal?  2:40 about
The cool cant wait for it
it's like power rangers... BUT FOR MEN!!!
What is the song ?
I was excited when:\n\n1. I thought they were now letting 1 person control 1 robot\n2. I thought it was maybe one human faction versus another. they closed the rift. Y are there more aliens now? That story was ended ffs
I want to pilot giant robots
I've been waiting for years to watch this sequel
Jaeger's attractive point is massive movement and not floaty... Different point with tranformers..... Also the name like Gypsy danger... it s really full of swag kk by the way where is charlie hunamm?
This already looks like it's going to be absolute shit
This looks so shit like a transformers movie. Fuck they should have not make a sequel to Guillermo del toros fantastic movie. The cgi even looks shit. And you can't beat ron pearl man who was awesome
Any one else dislikes the same sleek design to all the jaeger they don’t seem to have the same personality as the ones from the first movie
This is what i fucking love about this movie. Jaegers actually died, making the bleakness actually seem believable. Now they're just fucking power rangers in the sequel and the worst that can fucking happen is a broken arm\n\nAlthough it's not out yet so i want to be proven wrong.
I own the first one
Hollywood runs out of ideas so they start making prequel s smh
Best Movie Downloading Site Is Tubemediadown.com
i cant wait for it to come out
KARL FOOKING TANNER THE LEGEND OF GINALLEY at 1:29
Holy shit its GLaDOS! Also in the mood to rewatch Evangelion now. (Very similar genre)
The original Pacific Rim is a cult classic, this looks worrying though. And WTF is up with the trailer music... No Ramin Djawadi this time eh? That sucks.
At this point it's titan fall
2:19 GlaDOS is going to be in the movie, now I have too see it, XD XD
Did Michael Bay direct this garbage?
I kinda enjoyed the first pacific rim. I'm curious about this one, but very obnoxious music.
Those robots look like toys
for 1 centuries
Fucking rap ruined it.
pick memememememememememem
The cast looks disappointing...
2:20 Glados?
Looks like Drift and bulkhead evolved..
Epic
PORTAL voice :)
Pacific rim 2 or Kingsman 2 pick one
I've been waiting SOOO LONG for this OMG
Look like power ranger ;))))
jaeger kaiju vs jeager kaiju?
*Brutalisk joined the game*
transformer?
That is disappointing
Playing 2Pac😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 truly immortal
Glados is that you?
2:31 is that GLaDOS?
Glados?
tupac :D
Why do the Jaegers look so skinny?
The fightscenes are so awesome 😍
0:50 godzilla hopefully
nutella
Looks cool to me

OMG They used gladous's voice!!!!
nice trailer, horrible music
2:18 GLaDOS?
So sick!
how is this trending it only has 14k views, youtube is rigged
Hey man! I'm a small filmmaker that really wanna share my content. I would really appreciate, if you guys could give me a chance, and check my channel out. I hate promoting, but I stand 100% by my content, and spend a lot of time on it. I hope some of you would give me a chance :-)
The motion capture scene 1:20 of this video seems to have been corrected. \nI have a Sony Mirrorless camera. But it does not get the same neat motion capture effect as this video.\n I think he used masking editing.  So I put this on my channel.\n I hope you can watch and review.
I also live in wine country.
Hi! I made a little video on my youtube channel filming the beauties of my Sicily. If you want to, go check it out :) https://youtu.be/83exeRD2XQ8
Hey, guys! I have a new travel video I hope you guys would check it out. Thank you https://youtu.be/Ve7_P38jbDc
Class! A man just steep races!
I daydreamed through this whole video.  What'd I miss?
0:39 think gopros cheating us a little on the capabilities of its slow mo look at the front wheel looks like they are using a time warp style plugin in post to generate that slowmo. Either that or YouTube's player is getting shitter and shitter by the day.
I have two GoPro hero 5....been trying to get a microphone for it...for interning someone for my channel...what would you recommend for me to get?

Does'nt his rap music make him enough money?! 😅 artist name patchy
weird morphing frame to frame in first jump...which gopro was used? Not Hero4K obviously, or why is there no 4k playback?
I hate how you guys removed slow motion editing from your software. I have to buy from somewhere now. Ughhh why did I get the hero 6
I have a hero5 but i don't know how to do the thing at 1:19
some blockiness in some parts, pretty good for such a tiny camera though
Go pro hero 6 is just godlike no other way of explaining it
i have good videos i just need a shoutout https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4mqz-h2EgIXcCMs1y0c7Sg

Makes me wish we had a decent mx vs atv game
all cool but the avverrage gopro user doesnt have a drone for all thkse sick shots. You should do a tutorial on how to make the best video with your gopro by yourself
Wahhhhh is it made by the hero 6 or fusion it so bieutiful 😍😍😍😍
Any small time youtubers care to support each other? Comment if interested
Hello from Reunion Island. Nice video
someone make video better to go pro ? I dont think
Meeehhh.. \n\n\nHold my beer. \n\n\n\n\nI can't do that!
compared to release videos of hero 5 and 6 quality of this one is very bad. Oversharpened and full of moire and false detail. Did they not use protune ? why is it ? quality looks imo as hero 3 or hero3+ at max. @gopro #gopro please explain.
heck yes!! some sick shots with the go pros
this was just top shelf stuff. that hero 6 in the gimbal was rock solid and looked great
Man, those big airs 1:22 are mesmerizing. Can seriously watch those over and over.
The new Trials game looks pretty good.
Nate has so many backflips under his belt he’s got it mastered!
For the idiots who think that the slo-mo clip at 0:39 is native to the camera, you guys are wrong. You can obviously see that Twixtor (or another similar effect) has been used
Best part was the slow motion in the air
Are GoPros image really that clean?
Nice bro
A+ in editing
What gopro was filming?
Kan ni jö jete monga motorccros vidior😎😉🙂😎🙂

Ese estabilizador de la Hero 6, es impresionante!!!
Anyone wanna check out my longboard edit w/ the karma grip?\n\nDope video btw🤙
la gopro è fantastica, ma purtroppo lo sport più estremo che faccio è quello di alzarmi la mattina dal letto..
Let me get a GoPro
makes evil knievel look like a farmer on his john deere...
I make videos with my GoPro hero5 and I’m not gonna do anything cheesy. Check them out tho;)
Wow Amazing Video ! Great stuff!
2 mins video but felt like 2 seconds
Wow nice

If you dont mind me asking,  what was that pole like device that he had attached to his Gopro,  have never seen that before,
This is good. But the best video is Danny MacAskill's..
these videos are so inspiring, please go check my new youtube channel
GoPro cameras are garbage. I bought a hero and the not replaceable battery died in 3 months. Not a scratch on it. Total ripoff! \nAvoid buying any GoPro!
I Love Your Channel

Waw gopro hero 6
Well this is dumb
0:48 is that walt?
I need halloween short
the bear
Now i want a short with Oswald!
I thought Mickey was gonna say something else when they come into the cave
Y Pinocchio y not Alice in wonderland
I don't know why i got sad when i saw walt and mick wink
1.12 A rat afraid of another rat.
I think I should make the video shorter !!
I almost cried at 3:04! #RelationshipGoals
They did make a holloween short its on demand if you have spectrum
These are so cute and funny!
La la la la la la la
OH MY GOODNESS THIS IS SO MAGICAL!!! <3 <3 <3 <3
I don't like it
The amount of referencing here, wow!!! Everything from Pinocchio's opening song, to Disneyland's Nature Wonderland to an original park map. Heck... it even foreshadows the new Mickey ride in WDW! It also remains vividly entertaining!
I've been there before
This is definitely the true story behind Big Thunder Mountain
this is the pinnacle of humor i love these so much
It would have been funny if the ending was that they were dreaming and none of that happened
My cousin thought they were brother and sisters but nope 😂😂
Mickey has a beautiful singing voice
Thunder mountain reference?\n\n\n\n\n\nOops forgot the splash mountain reference
Make Thailand episode plz <3
I love you 😘 so much and you can always be loved
Great throwback to Disneyland's old attraction
I love these shorts
I don't know why, but i love 1:00 soooooo much!
Ummmm...  One question were are chip and dale?
This is a rip off of cuphead
Disney need to go back to hand drawn animation :)
I can't handle the amount of references in this one short.
I cant believe The rainbow caverns was a real place... I got goosebumps.
They were literally riding big thunder mountain
make a  valentines day movie
IT'S MICKEY MOUSE...
Is supposed to be how Thurber Mountain was made??? Disney👏
that the best thing isee on the (hot shows) on youtube ...paint and fantasy
Cmon disney do what the creators of Cuphead did and go back to your roots this animation style sucks
This has all the charm of the old cartoon shorts they used to do! Love it!
Lol. I found this vid when it had 666 views.
Aww, this one was so sweet!! :D
The new Star Wars is looking great!
Who used to have these kinds of animations on cassette tapes  \n\nOnly 90s kid will understand
These shorts never disappoint me. They're the best!
Walt Disney winking like I got you! just made my day
I want a game in this animation style!!!! Like cuphead
Iowa
By 3:13 I thought it would end with a sad ending
I love those rats.\nThe ones with the plague.
I really hate the new mickey mouse animation design\nI remember when I was 10 they had the 3d/classic design..\nGood old days when disney actually cared about fans...
I'm sick of Disney adhering to these hetro-normative stereotypes
Wish I had a chance to ride that attraction before it was closed... alas, I wasn't even born yet. Still a great short though.
That was so good especially 0:07
I hope they make a Halloween short
Did they rly put. A goat next to TNT 😂😂
again, i ask myself how do i get here. haha
Ren and Stimpy may well be the most influential cartoon ever. Seems most cartoons these days share its DNA. Even Mickey now.
Did they just .... die ??
Rated G Halloween movies in a nutshell0:57
i love how they brought back Pinocchio :')
And so, they stuck in the Rainbow Caverns and live happily ever after😂😂
These are AMAZING, who is making these? And why arent they more famous??
Mikey mousse
T H U N D E R  R A I L R O A D
When I heard that the short opened with Little wooden head from Pinocchio I immediately liked it because pinocchio is my favorite movie
I hope they make a ride out of this
Ha ha
Who else loves Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse ?
I want Duffy to be in one of these shorts.
Rats with plague I thought plague is done but not in Madagascar
Wow this bonus Cuphead level looks just like a Disney short!
Walt Disney 0:49 😭😭😭😭 RIP
These shorts are funney 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😃😂😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃

That type of song you can do in car rides... making love.. even Family party... or listening just by yourself late night by a neon fading light... ODESZA is pure magic  <3
This song is uplifting... makes me wanna cry... I am crying now..
There is a very obvious reason why this is my favorite song on the album. Very nostalgic feeling and amazing like all your other tracks, keep it up ODESZA!
Atleast 50% of the views here are mine
Odesza brings all the feels again.
100% Restored Humanity.
Shitt im not first
fucking hell this is intensely beautiful
This song gives me chill
Does anyone know who the female is singing at 0:59, 2:20, and 3:19? Did some research but unable to find a name.
does anyone know the female vocalist at 0:58 ? :/
Fcking amazing!
bread
I don't understand why every music video about afros share stereotypes.
song is amazing but wtf is the video
The melody the words the video has some kind of warm light that makes me smile :) I love how Odesza has grown over the years!
This song feels like both a eulogy to past endings, and a hymn to new beginnings at the same time. That's pure magic to me.
Beautiful. This touched my heart.
What are we doing in the comment section. ENJOY THE MUSIC
I was making a video basted in one of your songs (Rely) and i find out that now it has copyrights.It's about a shipwreck in Greece,is there any way  i can use your song..It's the only one that matched for me!!
Love this video! Matches the song beautifully!
I love that the guys make an appearance in the video...
Since October Good Music Been Showing Up :D
Yes, my favorite video from you guys! I am a big fan of Leon Bridges so its dope you all made the video on film and kept it authentic to your sound as well as his
What I really appreciate about this album is that they focused on sounds rather than beats if that makes sense. Like it freakin gives me the feels.
Nicee
Please make a full album movie for A Moment Apart!
This gave me chills. Lots of beautiful emotion. Great job, guys, as always.
Wait, how old is Leon bridges?? I thought that album Coming Home was from like 50 years ago what is going on
Hey guys, I've recently made a mix that I think might appeal to some of you.\nIf you have some spare time on your hands, check it out! thanks.\nhttps://soundcloud.com/19untld97/sleepless-mix02
good song but why the black people
I just noticed ODESZA IS IN THE VIDEO AT 2:20
I love this song!  It's like how music from the 70s and 80s sounded, but in a modern way.  Finally music that I'm proud of, that was made during our present time
Hey guys please check out my new music YouTube channel. Thanks
Favorite off the album.
Everyone white girl just orgasmed at the same time
When i listening the album for the first time i think Its too different than old themes now some weeks later i fucking love this album :D
My speakers won't go loud enough for this one
A Moment Apart-FAN MADE MOVIE!..https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llEbJrs5MVs&t=25s
I feel more connected to my Afro-brother roots.
Heard the song live at Bumbershoot before the album came out and it's one of my favorites off this incredible album.
I want to be friends with Leon. He seems like such a humble and down to earth dude.
Notice Odesza at the party at 2:19? awesome video <3
Such a  nice music video.
sounds a little bit like Moby

This album is so good. Like all songs from Odesza <3
This makes me wanna be black! Just this communal, easy going vibe❤ Why am I so white haha:)
This it probably the only song they have ever made that I don't like
Просто БЛЕСТЯЩАЯ ПЕСНЯ! А вот над клипом можно было и получше заморочиться...
Perfect song for some wedding planning and stuff! Spread LOVE :)
Most killing track on this album

They are such an amazing couple.... they are so sincere.... so loving...so compassionate when they look at each other. They are the best country music couple. I have all of their music and even the Barbie dolls. They are the best
How I love this song!
These two are so beautiful together:) After 17 years with my sweetheart, we still look at each other the same way as they do. We'll grow old together, and when one passes, the other probably will soon after from a broken heart. He is my best friend, my everything. My true love
4 and a half years ago, I wasn't sure about The rest of my life?? https://youtu.be/CodlS_NDKXA\nThank you for the song.\nGod bless
What's with these country singers ? Loving their wives too much... Tim McGraw , Thomas Rhett etc..is it all real ?
Beautiful song and beautiful video😄😄😄.Lol
I love the song, the video.. I don't know why they have to be angry all the time..  <wink wink> But I love the song. I can't wait to hear the rest of the album. Thank you Faith and Tim!
Real people knew the song before the video 🔥\n  I don't care  Tim McGraw buy youtube views from *AUTHENTIC* *Views* *dot* *com*
Faith's voice sounds way better in this song than in Speak to a Girl, but Tim sounds weird at the end. And can def. tell Ed Sheeran co wrote this
Such a beautiful song! Great video too! Excited for the album to come out! Can't go wrong with these two!
Such a beautiful video 😭😭 they are so beautiful together! Always have been.. does Faith even age?!  ❤️

Faith Evans aging like a fine Wine...... and id be fine to if my husband was Tim McGraw
Country music is pretty good, country people are dumbshits that cant get their heads out of their own ass to understand how the world works, trapped in their own small town backward world.
This video is a masterpiece! It’s gorgeous and simple yet it says so much.
They are the most beautiful country couple and have a beautiful family. I hope and pray for you both that you stay together. I love your music, love you both. God Bless you and your family.
0:14 I thought it was the father of Hannah Montana (Miley Cyrus) 😂
Now THAT'S the kind of love I'd like to find!    ....maybe someday.....
Two beautiful people that makes good music 💕and I enjoy the passion that they have for each other.
Ok - I need to tell my husband to sing to me like that when he walks into a restaurant even with our screaming kids and embarrassed teenager. That was amazing.
I just love this couple....
I want a love like this..😔
Happy 21st Wedding Anniversary, look for their upcoming Showtime special
Pure magic for sure....I pray for them that with the Lord's help they will continue to be strong in their marriage !!!  Reminds me of my own marriage of 29 years to a long blonde headed country girl with pretty blue eyes...only the Lord gives this gift !!!
Love this song ! I\nAlways love watching true love ;) This is magic
Love their harmony, love the song.
I love this so much.they are so perfect together.
This will be played at tons of weddings.
This is such a lovely song💕💕

Shoutout to all the ladies getting a pedicure after this.
I want to suck your toes Kate
Am I the only one who's embarrassed of having a foot fetish? 😔
0:06 Man, that's a huge housefly! Someone's getting a reprimand!
“You know how I feel about feet!” “Bunion” - Junior Soprano
I respect Idris Alba even more now..\nUs feet lovers have to stick together lol
I absolutely love feet too and I think it's a great when celebs come out about there foot fetish.
Nothing wrong with a foot fetish...as long as they feet aren't disgusting and the nails are long and nasty xD
that's Kate Winslet?   I was thinking, damn, Emma Thompson looks GOOD!
I keep forgetting that Kate is British, she's so good at doing an American accent.
I was smiling and giggling the whole time but the last two lines had me in splits
katie really needs some botox under the eyes
I love Idris. Can't wait for more Luther
I love how idris took his hand back reallll quick 😂😂😂😂
Why is Chris Rock naked?
109 thumbs down. Why? No, wait, I don't know why. You can keep it to your self.
Idris is black so that makes him cool... White people in these comment are so funny!
Kate looks beautiful and she never really ages! amazing! Also, who else noticed she had Invisalign?
Stacker pentacost has a print of every kaiju's feet in his office and now we know why
This is trending but Liam Gallagher isn't?
Chris looks like a little boy lol
Omg I just watched Ryan does something every week his videos are hilarious check him out and share
This man is perfection
Theres a FLY on the wine glass at the start of the clip!!!! Did Graham drink from this glass later on?!?!?!
'I can't wait to see this movie' LOL
In the comment section: foot folk.
just watched their movie , I am yet to recover from that love scene where Ben(Idris) sweeps Alex(Kate) off her feet to bring her to bed, so perfectly savage
blanket technique veteran discussion dead principal.
Idris please be my second husband!!😂
I thought i was the only one with a foot fetish
I would never have guessed that Chris is older than Idris.
im so glad luther is returning for season 5
The guy literally directed a short for Sky which was centred around a woman and her love of shoes because he likes feet that much. The signs are all there haha
Idris I want your baby
If you don't know what Chris Rock meant by 'Hammertime' watch this and all will be revealed https://youtu.be/NP7_SIRfo-c
I think Kate Winslet is a bit of diva.
You can tell Idris can't stand Kate and to tell her to keep her socks on really shows the lack of chemistry considering he loves nice feet. From how bossy Kate is I can tell why he doesn't like her.
i dunno...still think Idris is faking that accent...
There's a fly in Graham Norton's wine glass at 0.07
Idris: I've done a lot of films where there are a lot of guys.\nChris Rock: That's no excuse.  \n\nSmart and funny - LOL!
Idris is my boy and Kate looks great. Chris is the one true rock.
I love Kate's hair!!!!
Did anyone else search Kate Winslet feet before the video even finished playing?
He's going to get so many feet pics slid into his dm
I can not say  it often enough - I LOVE  Idris
These 3 had brilliant chemistry together
Guys, he's only human
0:34 same Chris. Same.
BLACKED
I do too
He's hot
WWWLOGANPAUL./SHOP
Grahams reaction hahah
Now I'm picturing Idris doing things to my feet.....
0:06 There is a giant fly getting drunk off of Graham Norton's drink just over his left shoulder.
I to have a foot fetish ha
Well.. Idris Elba is younger than Chris Rock..
Poor old Idris clearly nervous about  the sex scene and promoting this movie, Kate bailed him out with a story about a foot fetish
Stringer Bell does it again. \nIdris is the coolest.
Idris is a foot guy - YUP we're meant to be ;) LERVE Kate Winslet and Chris Rock!!
Am the only one around here who noticed the fly in Graham's wine?
The non-verbal communication between Idris and Kate is interesting... she grabs his hand and he does pull away...
I've just done films with a lot of guys.\nTHAT'S NO EXCUSE!\nOkie dokie, that's beautiful.
Love Kate and Idris. Not being nasty but Kate looks so tired eyes here, prob jet lagged! Wondering why she chose those tights too.... sorry Kate but you look silly in those tights. Idris is a dish 😍🤣
''Hi Guys I'm Karlie Kloss and I've just create-----A WEBSITE?? YES!! WE KNOW!! WE ALL KNOW!!! CONGRATULATONS!!!!  WOW!! GO YOU !! CREATING A WEBSITE?? WHATEVER NEXT!!
i really don't why there are fly's in the studio 0:08 graham's glass ...
I thought that was madonna
Has Winslet done surgeries on her face? I didn't recognize her to begin with!
Kate winslet mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

Hahah Eddie Murphy Boomerang Film check it out.
Kate looks incredible in those fishnets. Wow...
Can you imagine Chris Rock is 7 years older than Idris Elba
Chris Rock is looking good.
*Movie guy voice* Chris Rock, Idris Elba in: Brokeblack Mountain.
Bet he dose you know how them black men get around white women
Ok I already liked Elba as an actor, but I just noticed his hand tattoo I totally didn't know he had, just hours after I got my hand tattoo aaand he just admitted havin a foot fetish, which I also have, on national tv looking cool as hell, Elba just turned into one of my fav celebrities lol
Chris Rock is 52
Idris Elba 😍

Good lad get on dem feeeeet
😂😂😂
Idris 💙
Having a foot fetish is no longer creepy now a famous rich black man likes feet
well. if idris has a foot fetish, i guess now i have a foot fetish
Was i the only one grossed out? xD
Guest: I like to keep myself clean, head to toe, you know.\nGraham Nortons YT channel: GUEST HAS A FOOT FETISH
Most overrated actor ever.
I bet he has another foot in his trousers.
Foot fetish is gross
I hate feet
Ewww nasty
Foot fetishes are disgusting. FEET ARE DISGUSTING!
I hate Idris Elba ever since he came on the office. He's not even a popular actor and has failed in all his mainstream movies.
Why hasn't Idris done many love scenes?\n\nPerhaps because he's black and and the only people who want to watch negro and white woman get intimate are degenerate SJWs and Jews.
Always thought there was something wrong with that coon

Scary Legs is the best Simon's Cat ever. I had to laugh out loud a lot. Thank you, Simon!
These Simon's Cat videos are so entertaining and so funny
So Simon freaked out when the cat jumped on the armrest. Then he doesn't even seem to mind when his cat DESTROYS THE SOFA. Sheesh, what's in that popcorn?
As Hagrid says: Seriously misunderstood creatures, spiders are. ;)
My dog used to kill spiders. Now it's all about squirrels, rabbits, and other dogs and why they are in ours or our neighbors yards or even in that open space out back where two more houses could fit. Our cat won't kill spiders either. He's more of a rabbit killer. He likes to hunt.
Is și cute

Don't kill spiders ! It's bad ! Even if you're afraid of them (I have penis phobia, I don't kill them...).\n(Yes, I know : no spider was killed to make this film.)
I love Simon the cat. And the spider was like what's going on with him , how funny.😂😂😂😆😄😄
For someone who is scared of spiders, he should have used that tea kettle more effectively. That was great!

I love how cat is like I don't know then squishes the spider again
Soon as I see a large spider I would of pelted out the loft.. I hate large spiders.. Although I'm ok with little spiders

Aren't there special bands that go through towns singing the news and how they feel about it? If so, can't we enlist them to sing songs with info about what to do in individual towns and neighborhoods?

I'm in sixth grade middle school and I'm learning about Spanish and in today I cried in Spanish because we were watching videos about how the hurricane came through and it was really devastating so I really hope that you guys are okay and this blessed my eyes
When the government turns their back, that's when the celebs step in.
Who agrees that he should shave his beard and grow back his hair? Nobody? Oh.
The coqui at the end always gets me. What an amazing song.
it's almost like praying love to Borinquen
Amazing! Thank you, Lin-Miranda and all the artists involved. Support Puerto Rico!!!!
I saw Lin Manuel Miranda on Steven Colbert show taking about the song Almost like praying. I knew I just had to buy this song, so I ask my granddaughter to buy it because I didn't know how to purchase. She bought herself a song & purchase 1 for me. I text all my familia & they all purchased the song to. I even send it to PR. I ❤️my island
I wish i had enough money to donate
I have listened to this son many times. Thank you lin manuel miranda for what you have done to help all the puerto ricans. This such a inspiration in a time of hardship. and the song is so catchy  and beautiful. thank you!!!!!!!
Anything to bring attention to this crisis  & help our fellow American citizens in need  and nice to hear the needed word Praying, but he's based this appeal on a song from West Side Story, a musical that actually is offensive to Puerto Ricans.
JLo had some of the stronger vocals in this whole song
Very powerful song I wish you the best
Hi I am a small youtuber in PR.  Today I went to Jayuya PR and record a video giving bags of food to the people and I was wondering if I can use this song in the video?
I'm so Proud of Lin Manuel. GBU Brother Adelante Boriqua.
FEMA, GOV OF PR and WHITE HOUSE is ignoring the richest family in America, capable to donate trillions to Puerto Rico. http://eblm.us/letter-towhite-house.html
Was this sent from the Heavens?
Fuck despacito. Let's get this song to 65 million likes.
SUPER HOT !!!!!!!!!!!!! WE LOVE YOU PUERTO RICO ,STAND STRONGER, NEWYORKS GOTCHA BACK, FORGET TRUMP LET THE LORD DEAL WITH THIS, KEEP THE PEACE & YOUR 💘.                            KNOWLEDGE
This song/video is a beautiful and wonderful thing.  The people of Puerto Rico are OUR people.  What they are dealing with is horrifying.  We own it; we should fix it.  This is a humanitarian crisis.  Fellow human beings are suffering.  We are better than this response.
This song is a fucking bop. Love ya', Lin.
I want to help/donate tp puerto rico now!!!!! like if you agree
Well done!
Thx for the song !!!! #myPuertoRicoIsStrong 🇵🇷❤️🇵🇷
Sending my prayers to my boricuas from yours truly a fellow Guatemalan-American.
FROM THUS MIXED MEXICAN \BLACK GIRL U SEND ALL MY PRAYERS FROM GOD TO YOU
Much love from the United States to Puerto Rico❤️ Donald trump is NOT my president😡
Stellar.  The only thing that would make this better is an extended version featuring Bruno Mars (he's half-Puerto RIcan though we Pinoys cliam him as entirely our own), Ricky Martin, Robi Draco Rosa, Nicky Jam and Daddy Yankee chiming in...  I know the star power is already amped up to the max, but imagine if you add these people in the mix...
all the thumbs down are from republicans and russian trolls.
we watched this in my chorus class and I fell in love with it😻😻✨
lin manuel really got everybody on this track wow
I'm Puerto Rican and this song honestly warmed my heart to see all these artists trying to help my people. Truly, from the bottom of my heart, thank you.
Thats sad that ppl by ppl i mean *Trump* really dont care about the ppl really going through some shit down their if only i could but i can't too young 😭🙇
Sending love and strength to my fellow Americans in Puerto Rico who are going through so much. \n\nI hope that captions are added to this video so that those of us who don't know the names of all the towns on this wonderful island can learn them!
This was perfect I'm so proud of everyone involved (ANTHONY RAMOS)
Praying for Puerto Rico.  Beautiful song  had me in tears.  Thanks for posting the#.  Please give us updates.

He lookd like he waz fucking the pumkin lmao 😂😂
NEW SUBBIE...YOUZ A FOOL
Feel so Caucasian 😂😂
Said it before his call up that Winks is what England need ahead of every other English CM. Henderson and the likes seriously do fuck all. Don't assist, don't pass forward, don't slice open defensive teams etc. The only thing those plodders do is pass sideways like Crabs and run around like a headless chicken. Right now England should be looking at Dier/Winks/Drinkwater/Lewis Cook/Tom Davies/Loftus Cheek/Chalobah/Barkley/Ward Prowse. \n\nHenderson, Livermore, Ox, Sturridge, Delph, Wilshere (who needs to prove he can stay fit for a season), Shelvey are all fucking liabilities in so many ways from lack of skill, awareness to discipline and temperament.
What I like about this boy is he gets the ball and straight away he turns towards goal, too many English players panic and turn their backs and start passing back into their own area
Thanks for putting this on. I could watch this lad all day. Here, guys, is the future creative pinnacle of England's midfield. I've watched him grow with Spurs and he never has an off day. Always busy, always creative, quick and clever, combative and with a passing accuracy that just gets better and better. He will be our 'Little Iniesta' - Pochettino's words.
Didn't see Harry winking once what is this video about? That 7 seems pretty good though. Still a fit Wilshere is what England needs.
Already England's best player apart from Kane. Far superior to Alli and Rashford who constantly give the ball away.
He has good technique... for an English player
I hope to get rid of the disgrace of Henderson like Milner
gotta start at the world cup
time tovget rid off players like shelvey and livwrmore lol offer nothing
no more hendersson. hendersson lacks ability on the ball and he could only operate uaing his pressing and occassional long passes and switch play in a fast tempo pressing team like liverpool. when games slow down at international level he cant do a thing against dense defence. emgland has many technival players and wilshere barkely and winks could dictate play and play those through passes between crowd and create space. its time to use the proper man
Eric Dyer / Jack Willser / Daily Ella / Rose Barclay / Avey eijreya / Harry Winkes / Lewis Cook / Adam Lallana midfield should go to Russia and toss the dumb Henderson off the plane
Cr1t1kal brought me to this retard.
HOAX. Fucking HOAX. Total bullshit. Not a single real shot fired.
He actually asked a cop for a gun in the middle of so much confusion. \nFucking clown
So he’s a cop now? Thought he was Mike Cronk a retired Alaskan school teacher.
So you are using a horrible tragedy to promote yourself. You are pathetic.
This is why the USA needs more guns?
Dan Bilzerian is a REAL man who lives a playboy hedonistic lifestyle of awesomeness.  You keyboard warrior basement creatures wish you could even live half his life! All you Dan Bilzerian haters can suck a dick and choke on it!
stupid cops and security how do not know the key players in your own city and what they are all about dan could have helped man he prolbey had a plan that was way better than what they were doing i know he would have done some damage way to go dan too bad thier were idiots around you
I'm a cop giv me gun pls
You misspelled fake runs like a pussy\nEdit: did he claim to be a cop??
I thought it was chuck Norris
Give me the Fucken Gun past it on while you past me 'em bullets tell your mate get the fuck over here film me shooting these's criminals lets put them to justice Now. Yeah an you Bro get the fuck over here an help me take cover team work.\nElite swarm them capture.\n Make sure they faired us not to be taken over we over come the Combat!! 🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫😬
Poses with guns all the time 📸\nwhen he actually needs one it’s nowhere to be seen 🙃. Not that he would of done anything other than to try and make a video of himself trying to be a hero. When has anyone ever helped an incident through having a gun legally?!🤔
haha what a boss he probably would of raided that hotel to you pussies keep talking shit
What a idiot, making it harder for the cops to do their job.
It's just sad that he ended innocent lives & now their families are going to grieve for the rest of their lives, knowing there's no way they can get their loved one back apart from keeping their spirit alive & knowing that person as a good human being and not what this guy did to them.
he said he is a col?!! lmao he's no cop he is probably in on it..he has video gambling with the shooter
Distinct sound of several guns shooting  at the same time in the video,\ncombine the sound of multiple guns and the number of injured and hit people then you have strong indications of multiple shooters gunmen in Las Vegas.
Dude record me so I look like hero!
Hero of USA!! Should've played mission impossible theme song in the back ground
i'm rich so i can do whatever i want fucking cunt
You prompt your mate/friend/colleague to video you running in, demanding a gun, then cringing behind a barricade. What a rainbow snowflake. Real people were taking real hits and paying for it in real blood. Fuck off and shrivel up homeslice
Whatever Dan think your a hero....you couldn't run a muck on hard heavy benders with these hard hitters...#rookie
Fake and gay, just like the whole Vegas hoax (but Dan managed to make it even fake and gayer)
holly shit! the cops all choose to risk dying out in the open, rather than being next to this asshole.
dan: hey give me a gun\ncop: fuck no!....i mean oh shit youre dan bilzerian. you went through buds twice right? holy shit! were all gonna be ok guys, dan bilzerians here!! heres my rifle, heres my side arm, heres my taser. and why dont you fuck my wife and daughter after youre done catching the bad guy!?
i thought he went to the car to GET a gun? Just his creds?
Cop should have gave him a gun, but secretly emptied the clip before giving him it. Here, you go, mate. Have fun!
wait...this guy asked for a gun?? BWAAAAHAAAHAAAHAAAHAAAHAAAHAAAHAAAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHA
At least he doesnt act like he is dodging the bullets :/
0:42 you mother fucker give mea cop i am a cop    give mea gun    faggot   cocosucker bitch
LOL CCW and similar license to carry Creds don't mean shit.
Rejected so hard...
Ask yourself does this look like the actions of a coward or a man trying to help?  He isn't helping anyone sooooo
Haaaaaahaaaa love it I don't know who the fuck you are....
Must have been stormtoopers doing the shooting. Thank God a lot of these mass shooters aren't marksmen.
I can show you my creds lol
to him, he probably has it all planned out in his head like he's in a fucking movie and he's the protagonist that's gonna save the world lol. a true instagram star narcissist
this is the dumbest thing i have ever seen in all my life, dumber even then the guy who said he didn't give money to homeless people because he was scared he might get aids from touchin their hand
how long until he takes this video down lmao
Faggot called a cop who actually did something for the people a retard fuck him
DUDES A HERO & LEGEND. NIGGAZ HATE WHAT THEY AINT GOT!!!!!!!!!!
I bet he is already talking shit with Joe Rogan . Pathetic bitches
Is he mental did he ask a police officer if he needs help
He was lucky the police officer didn’t shoot him
Help get me to 1k no vids 🔥
What was he holding?
Dan 'i ran toward the Vegas shooter' Bilzerian
Dude, don’t you know? This is all about me! WHAT A MASSIVE DOUCHE
When you're a narcissistic wanker, well... You're just a narcissistic wanker. 😕
I WANTED TO SEE THE FUCKING DUDE SHOOTING, I WANTED A MAN STANDING THERE WITH A GUN GONG GAT GTA GRAAW SKRRT ALL THAT SHIT BUT NO ALL I GET IN THEM STAIRING AT SOME DUDE WITH A COWBOY HAT 🤠 LIKE BRUH
I don't know who the fuck u are haha
dan i have all the guns and hoes but not when i need them
Stupid fevking idiot thinks he's a hero .. Look at me Iam getting there
To bad this waste of skin never got shot
I could've been the 4,500th thumb up...instead I chose to be the 19,260th thumb down.
If they have turned on the lights on the hotel rooms maybe that would have cause poor 7 vision
If only the gunman aimed closer to him
O    M   G !!! Thank God Dan was there ..  a lot of people has been saved all because this super heroe was at the good place in the perfect time!! Thank God he had a camera too!
He's a cunt
he's an attention whore. c'mon there's a guy filming him. he thought this will be a great way to get attention
hahahhahahhahahhahhahahhahhahahhahahhahahhahhahahhahhahhahahhahhahahhahaha. I love idiots!! Even during an event as horrible as this they still give me a good laugh. I don't even know you hahahhahahhahahahha
hey Dan if you see this fuck you you pantywaist dumbass piece of shit. A child would know to go provide first aid instead of trying to bum a weapon off of an officer. you should be arrested for interfering with police business clownass
Wanna be.. That's all he is. Coward who runs away instead of helping others.
That's not running tword the shooter, that's cover and concealment.
This.... This here in 55 seconds is everything wrong with American gun culture. A nutjob with an arsenal many African warlords would be envious of, and a narcissistic nutjob who thinks the best way to combat it is with more guns and to just go in blazing.
I have no issue with Dan Bilzerian, but why the fuck would he put this video out? He gets a strip torn off him by a cop and only looks like an asshole here.
well he stayed well away from the field of fire and never got to close. who did he put up to filming him? that cop sure put him in his place, lol.
Everyone wants to be a hero these days
If I could to dislike this video again, I'd do that right now!
Oh sure a white guy asks cop for gun. He only gets yelled at but if a black man asks cop for gun...
BRO I GOT SUCH A GOOD VIDEO IDEA!! Get a shot of me running toward the building acting like we're gonna be the hero's that end this, it'll go so viral
Officer - you know better.\nWhelps!! I dont think Dan does tbh.
So ppl complain when he ranned. And complain when he wanted too kill the fucker... keyboard warriors at the finest.
The like to dislike ration reminds me of Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare
Fucking dumbass is telling a real cop to give up his gun?  Since Dan is some big star?  Moron...
it's a shame this useless piece of crap did not get shot that day. what a fucking shit-stain self-absorbed trust fund baby publicity whore. fuck you for the cunt you are
This idiot is lucky he was not charged for interfering with police duties. He was probably drunk or high and should be ashamed.
We can all agree that the shooter was a funkien dumb cunt
Just a BUDS washout turned Instagram operator.
👀 https://youtu.be/zFVpbCfclxQ
Fuck that was funny....
Fuck Dan blizarian
What an idiot... sweet creds bruh
Coyote Peterson
Fucking idiot
Faker than Pam Anderson's tits
achieved zero
lmao
Fkn pathetic cunt
The ting goes skrrrr
Aye fuk this guy aye
my favorite dc hero
Publicity stunt piece of shit
Haters gonna hate.
_My dad has diabetes_
That's crazy!
The cop should of given him the gun, i mean it's Dan Bilzarian after all!
zane wilson with sexy beast says words is better check it out here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjE6lABNJPw
What an absolute fucking hero.
Great looking Q but Eater obviously hasn't visited many BBQ joints in America.  😂😂😂
This video is brought to you by the NYC tourist board of overpriced, knock off BBQ for the hipster set commitee. No Franklin's, no Carolina pit BBQ joints, no KC BBQ, no Memphis or Alabama BBQ? Not even the birthplace of smoked Q in Lockhart Tx, Kreuz, Smittys or Blacks? This isn't a list of the best BBQ, this is an advertisement aimed at the inexperienced BBQ hipster who wants to be cool. Real BBQ connoisseurs know this is the most bogus Q list in America! Very disappointed Eater!
Very sorry, but having 2 Joints in NY on the Best in America List is absolute BS buddies!!
Wheres Franklins BBQ?
2 places from New York?  GTFO of here!  This is expensive bbq for suckers.
More Like Top 5 BBQ Joints From People in NY
How is Franklins BBQ not on this list!! Eaters gotta go do their homework.....
How can you list 2 NY bbq places, and not list any Carolina bbq!?!?
Why not Franklins BBQ?
Just putting NY once shows not to trust this list, but they did it twice. Dislike.
First eater I'm going to thumbs down, not for the quality but the content. 2 from new york, no franklin's which there is no argument, it IS the most popular BBQ joint in the US. No Kansas City, no Memphis. I wouldn't have complained until you said some korean BBQ joint in Atlanta was the number 1? WTF?!  go home eater, you're drunk.
Oops!  Looks like there's been a typo.  Pretty sure the headline was supposed to read Eater's The Only 5 Barbecue Joints We Ever Visited in America (Where We Had B-Roll Left Over).
So the title should read Two New York and Texas places and one Atlanta place. They havent even touched Kansas City, Memphis or even the two different styles of BBQ in the Carolinas. Like people have said you didnt do anything over Franklins while in Austin or even went to Kruez.
But wher s the funk and platonic flavors? Is it dry aged BBQ?
Snow's below NYC bbq? No Franklin's? Nothing from Carolinas or Kansas or Memphis?
This is a strange concept for a video. And the sound was wonky.
worst top five anything ever .......ppl in New York don't even believe it.
Unless title has changed I'm pretty sure this says Eater's top 5 favorite barbecue joints in america not best bbq joints in america  i dont understand why so many people are getting salty
Maybe not top 5 but que still looked pretty tasty
Who else replayed the first part over and over again?
Very lazy video. All you did was rehash b-roll from 5 places Eater had already filmed at and then put them into some arbitrary order. There is zero new content.
Seems biased towards texas style/beef bbq except for the korean one.
No Franklin's and no Smoque? You guys are amateurs.
more than a THIRD of the American population is obese....no wonder why (smh)
As an NYC resident, I'm absolutely loving how triggered everyone is getting over this list.
As a North Carolinian, this list offends me.  Eat at 12 Bones, Bum's and Skylight Inn and then do a remake of this video the right way.
Ok.. i'm droooooooling right now!
lol. NYC BBQ x2 come on!!
This is the first time I have downvoted a video of eater. This video is BS!
Clearly phoning it in with this segment. A top 5 BBQ without Franklin’s is a joke.
So the best bbq is in NY??
Step 1. Go to Austin, TX.\nStep 2. Remake this video\nStep 3. Profit?
It’s favorites you morons - not best
lol 2 NY BBQ restaurants\nThey should rename this The Time One of our NY Staff Went to TX
I was going to say something here about Eater people being high to put 2 NYC joints in here, but my BBQ brothers & sisters got here before me.  Get off the subway, Eater people, and go eat BBQ in the real world!
La BBQ is amazing, havne't been to Snows though.
I haven't been anywhere in KC that belongs on this list.
Wtf where is franklin's
I love eater.com, but this list is beyond pathetic.  I don't know whether to be mad or feel sorry for you guys.. 2 NYC?? smh
Where is ol Rudy's bbq in Jackson ga
This is a joke. I noticed Memphis is not even on their top 23 list. I guess because not “Eater city”.
I was just staring at the meat thinking the jibber jabber about the best joints was coming at some point in the time space continuum.  But I have to give you props for just showing video, with cool music and no mumbo jumbo.\n\nTotally missed the top joints but I'm also totally cool with that.
Oh how I love the comment section on Eater
damn you guys have to get better sound editors. 9/10 of your videos are so quiet my dog cant even hear it
wait.. i love this vid cuz of all the meats but wheres franklin at??
Whose list is this?! You must be from NY.
Eater this is sad even for you. The travel channel tv show food paradise did a whole hour special on the best places to eat bbq in the country. They even shows franklins.
This is the reason why is watch this channel
No Franklin's? You gotta be kidding me
Eaters top 5 BBQ joins in america, except we did not want to travel far so these 5 will have to do.... \nnone of the well known iconic and best BBQ places in the list....... wtf
eater is so corrupt how can 2 new york places be in top 5 bbq places. the owners of those 2 restaurants must paid you alot to say that.
sorry, this is fashionable bbq vs real and delicious bbq.
I just ate breakfast and this still made me hungry.
Some of those had nice smoke rings on them.
dude, you're going to start a war in the comment
No Joe's Kansas City? No Franklins? 2 NY places? Come on man... Worst top BBQ list ever.\nThey got our views though so... They win.
Kansas City? Memphis? NC? I LOVE this show, but wow this is the worst BBQ list I ever saw.
See, these kind of ignorant posts makes a semi-successful youtube channel such as yourself who is just beginning to establish a reputation, discredit themselves. disliked and unsubscribed for lack of trying, good job eater.
No Franklin's GTFO!  Also no Memphis or Carolina or Kansas City BBQ joints represented delete the Meat Show permanently!  Snows is awesome at least you got that right!
There's no way any NY should be on the list, hipster.
few things make me salivate more than delicious looking BBQ. I'm not pro, but it makes me miss my smoker, my next apartment or townhouse needs to allow charcoal lol
This one is clearly missing a part of the title! It should go like Top 5 Favourite BBQ Joints in America, that aren't Franklin. Get your editors to work, Eater! xD
High Dollar imitation city Q. You need to get out more for BBQ.
Y'all don't get out very often do you?  Good BBQ in Brooklyn? Give me a break.
Looks like eater is starting to run out of ideas they're starting to recycle existing content like the Gordon Ramsey channel and great big story
lol all places should be below the mason Dixon line if you're talking about good barbeque
Obviously you have never been to KC.
Is it the edit or do all 5 restaurants essentially do the same thing?\n\nThere's a Korean restaurant and a Kosher restaurant and they're basically serving the same thing, low and slow smoked brisket. I get the rubs will be different, but come on guys, BBQ is such a rich field, where's the variety?\n\nEvery one of these looked like a Franklins clone. It would be great to see content producers cast a wider net and showcase places that are more original in their concept.
And Franklin's?!?
Black’s Texas oldest bbq!
Fake news
Texas bbq>>>>>>>>all bbq
Thisade me have sexual feelings
Damn.... just damn...
whoa no franklin bruh?
Yum, yes please!
Heirloom is soooo good.
Some of these briskets..smh
*NICE!!*
First!
U know Nick put that kosher place on the list due to his guilt.
Eater: where the purview is limited and the points don't matter! No Memphis or KC places...sad!
No Joe's KC or Q39? Not a valid list
Wtf is this cancer comment section. Title says Eater's top 5 barbecue places in America. Its Eater's opinion so they like whatever they may want to like. If they choose to not have Franklins, dont be butthurt crybabies about it.
BBQ is a touching subject to some... You bring this and that is the best people go crazy 😂 it's like bringing up politics and religion.
been to hometown bbq and its not that great.  shouldn't be on the list.
I like how honest Nicol was. 👌 Constructive Contouring Criticisms.
I like how Christian is clueless another the makeup thingies.I'm the same.

That contour color is orange af 😕
Can you make a house tour? Really want see how your house looks like, and also want see the other part of the room you film in :)
I think I'm about the only one thinking this but, cheek contouring to me just looks an obvious dark line across your face - even when done well it doesn't decrease the cheek or enhance the cheekbones. Oh well
4:19 'gogo gaga' I LOVE CRISTINE  SO MUCH omg i never laughed so hard honestly loving this series
Christine heart my comment if you are holosexual

Cristine, you know how people make fun of u and freak out when you put the safety pin near your eye to separate your lashes? Well Audrey Hepburn used to do that to get her doe-eye look!
The only thing I wish we had extra in that video was the little « I’ll be taking over now » that she did with Tati & Manny. I find them hilarious with her face photoshopped in all their vids
Im my opionion you are beauty person Cristine(sory for my english 😉😇😅)
U are both beautiful
plz make a video of holographic eye balls.....
I will never get contouring, no matter how much I see it. Your face looks like it's drawn on damn it

Thank you so much if you take your time to read this long ass comment ❤️❤️ and I'll spam this once on everyone of your videos you post
When they started singing umberella ^.^

Yassss cristine slay mama!\n\n\nnicol cute too, but those lips guuuuuuuuuurl \n#saynotolipfillers
The first Vox Borders documentary launches in 8 days. It's publishing October 17th, across Youtube and Facebook. The other 5 will come weekly after that, on Tuesdays. If you want to make sure you don't miss them, you can follow me on Facebook: www.facebook.com/johnnyharrisvox or sign up for my newsletter: www.vox.com/borders-email. \n\nI'm so excited to release these. I've been working on nothing else for the past 6 months, and I think they'll live up to the hype!\n\n- Johnny
The  monkeys are moroccan native monkeys from the Atlas Mountains, there a big sea gap between morocco and that rock and u still ask how they got there ? Damn VOX u can be stupid sometimes
I know a guy when I lived in Gibraltar who threw a monkey off a cliff because it stole his daughters necklace.
huh. I never know europe dont have monkeys
I've been there a few times and the monkeys are so chill with tourists it's insane. They'll let you hang out, but your arms around them, sometimes they tried to feed me which got awkward 😅
I love Gibraltar
There are alot of these monkeys in northern India. I always see them when I visit
europe is full of monkeys my man.
why don't they leave Gibraltar and spread out?
Come to India, monkeys will even enter your hotel and sometimes humans here also behave like monkeys
So imperial Britain cared more for these macaques then they did for all the humans of the Indian subcontinent. How quaint
Very interesting topic, TERRIBLE footage. Damn son, if you can't nudge the camera in the right direction exposure-wise, you should get a competent cameraman to follow you.
Are these really monkeys? I thought monkeys had to have tails. Apes don't have tails.
The only wild monkeys in Europe: Rapefugees
i thought all monkeys had long tails. **the more you know**
Gibraltar will never be Spanish but forever remain part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
... are the illegal immigrants.
I live here haha this for me is super normal
Wait what about the millions of migrants?
Gibraltar is the best!!
I bet they are inbred as heck.
Lol complete bullshit. Just visit any Muslim ghetto in Europe. You'll see.
I am watching this about 1km away from where you are filming that and those monkeys are vicious and often attack you it you aren't careful on the devil's steps (one of the ways up to the top)
y is he pronouncing it macock?
Gibraltar also have to leave the EU with the UK even though they all voted to stay, and it's a bizarre situation...
i bet you went only to Marrakesh in morocco which is part of the culture itself just like la corrida in spain itself   , in Atlas mountains and many other places in Morocco  there are wild monkeys that are free and just like the ones in Gibraltar are used to be around humans for a big publisher like Vox making some googling  is a must do as you have the responsibility   to share credible and objective information ! and thank you
ONE OF THOSE IDIOTS STOLE MY GODDAMN ICECREAM TWO YEARS AGO IM COMÍNG BACK JUST WAIT
Muslims are all over Europe, that's one type of monkey
I thought I had a sam & niko tab playing in the background at the start of this video.
I went to an international guide camp in Co. Cavan in Ireland and the gibraltar guide leaders told us about 'los monos' being everywhere and being very naughty. Have you been to Jersey? It feels like a weird mix of France and Britain :)
Wouldn't the genetic pool for these monkeys be very limited to the point where they're inbreeding?
Finally a BORDERS episode about an actual border conflict. the rest were about stupid vending machines and surfing. Please don't fail me again.
Man where do I sign up for his job? It's so awesome to be able to travel and learn all these things, moreover being able to share them with the world on a popular platform.
These aren't monkeys. Monkeys have tails.
Those Monkeys are robbing bastards! One of them still has my old Nokia............
Asia is full of wild monkeys cuz you can definitely see it in India!
Gibraltar is not a zoo, so why cant I feed the monkeys? Stupid rules.
You hear tht  The Males Play A Huge Roll in Raising The Infants  I Respect Tht Too 👏🏽
The only monkeys? Mate you forgot the cast of Eastenders.
I clicked because the guy is hot
English is my second language, I'm asking, shouldn't he say there ARE monkeys instead or is ? 0:01
ohhh...you haven't travelled to india then haha
Who else is from Gibraltar here? Please tell me I'm not the only one.
All the British monkeys are coming to America and taking over TV host positions.
In my city, a monkey held up an old lady and took her money
Actually there are plenty of monkeys in Eu if you check a place called the rift on league of legends
hmmmmm nah will leave it its just too easy!
Militarized for WAR. Wow. Excellent observation
Let's see what happens after Brexit...
Funny how the thumbnail could referr both left and right as monkeys
You are a mix of Rhett and Michael from vsauce  lol
Oh ye, I visited that place about 2 years ago, but didn't know it was the only monkey inhabited place in Europe. Very strange indeed, there is an airbase built ontop of the water and you suddenly traveled from Spain to a British speaking area. If you visit, remember that the boarder patrol are British so don't be fooled by Spanish ticket scammers, especially since you don't even need a ticket cross boarders x.x
I knew there were going to be racist comments before opening them!
No, there is also monkeys in Finland. Winter monkeys.
Arent they supposed to be recording that new album? smh
what is the name of second track? the one that starts at 1:05?
What about all the monkeys that ran away from their country and are now plaguing Europe? They should be included too...
The monkeys will steal your ice cream and dolls if you aren’t careful, I’ve been there
But there's millions of monkeys in Europe 😉
Gibraltar voted 95% to remain in the EU😂
THEY FORGOT ABOUT THE WINDSOR MONKEYS IN WINDSOR CASTLE !
Thought this was going to be about middle eastern refugees
Orangutans are common in China India has monkeys ! It's all the same landmass .🐒🙊🙈🙉🐵
Bet there are gonna be plenty of racist ass comments down here
Thought this was gonna be about African and Middle Eastern immigrants...
You can find monkeys that claim to be refugees from Northern Africa all over Germany and France
Before too much longer the title will read  The only Europeans left in Europe. liberal trash.
The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, friends! \n\nRepent of your sins and put your faith in Him! He loves you! \n\nPlease don't listen to the lies of the enemy. Jesus is not angry at you, in fact He is waiting on YOU to call upon Him! Jesus died so that you may live! \n\nHe knows what you are going through, and He will help you if you would let Him. \n\nI pray you consider calling upon Him today. You may not get another chance, and to die without The Lord Jesus is a very dangerous thing. \n\nJudgement is also swiftly approaching, and Jesus is the Only Way to escape. So please trust and follow Jesus today! Don't be scared, Jesus TRULY Loves you! \n\nShalom, friends.
Go to the Catalan region of Spain next please!
It's mentioned in Pillar of Hercules by Paul Theroux
I hate how I have anxiety and live here. There is a 1/30,000 chance I could be in this video.
What are you talking about? I saw loads of wild monkeys when I was in Italy and more come there every day
Muslims are loose monkeys, should kill them all
Does someone have a link to listen to the last music? Despite the name in the credits I can't find it anywhere
Winston, is that you?
Photographing the monkeys is psychologically stressful for them.\n*Films the monkeys instead.*
Lol you make Gibraltar look interesting and not a boring shithole
I remember when i visited Gibraltar one of the monkeys sat on the back of one of my friends and started pulling on her hair and she started freaking out and i was like just chill out maybe you should stop trying get selfies with him and just take a photo of him .
Here are a few things here I think are important and cool about Gibraltar:\n- Gibraltar is one of the last territories that the UN considers a colony in the world. Gibraltar in this video is shown to be an entity Britain would give up and give back to Spain, but the residents and government of Gibraltar want to be entirely independent of both countries and be their own sovereign nation. \n-Gibraltar is entirely self-sufficient economically and they actually end most years with a surplus\n-Gibraltar is not just English and Spanish. Because of the small populace, minorities have a substantial impact on the culture. These include a large Indian community as well as the second largest population of Jews per capita in the world\n-Going off the previous point, many people from Gibraltar speak Llanito, a hybrid of Spanish and English with many words and phrases from Hebrew/Yiddish and Hindi mixed in.
The monkey myth - lose the monkeys, lose the Rock - is almost word for word like the myth about the ravens at the Tower of London, and both with the twist of Winston Churchill ordering the animals protected for the sake of the nation.
That's cool. I want to visit some day
I can't imagine the comments
Only wild monkeys in Europe \n\nNo go zones...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a joke...
Answer: antifa
joss fong i love you
This guy never smiles
You forgot the refugees
Welcome to Europe :)
We have immigrants
THEY APES. check for tails.
Welcome to watchpoint Gibraltar
I live there ☺☺☺
They’re apes
You mean immigrants
Congrats on 3 mill
Nevertheless including factor arrangement anymore virtue transfer.

3:57 That is a beautiful piece of music. Where do I get it? \nEnd credits say it's Travel Safe by Trilla 2 but a quick Google search doesn't reveal anything
Oh so thats why its called Watchpoint Gibraltar
This video shows the incredible skills of the pilots. Even after an unexpected wind gust after touchdown they managed to re-align with the runway. Incredible job by the pilots !!
This pilot can steer this giant plane with a joystick !! I can't steer a BF1 plan with a keyboard !!
The 'overcorrection' was probably due to the pilot being used to a jet with a lot less mass, such as a 777 or 737, which would have responded to the corrections a little faster, and would not have 'kept going' in the next direction, once corrected. The A380 is very responsive for its size, but a larger mass still takes longer to change directions, and when it does, it just keeps going.
Wow, those pilots went absolutely MAD with the rudder!
I'll bet that got the attention of any first time passengers.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have now landed and the pilot has turned the light on signifying it is now safe to change your trousers. Thanks for flying with us.
Just what speed was the crosswind anyone?
This a crosswind and excellent slipsliding landing from an A 380 how it should be performed. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lCh4aBH12g\nI think the gliding in Düsseldorf was not that bad with respect to the weather.\nBut turn your attention to the movements of the split rudder during the gliding process AND the behaviour of the split rudder just after touch down. The same behaviour as in Düsseldorf. After touch down they allign. \nJust before touch down the pilot manages to adjust with the rudder and find the center line and then, in half a second or 1 Meter of height things are turning from a secure landing to almost a disaster ( as it happens to be with accidents) because the split rudder work together ON touch down.\nQuestion is: Can the pilot be blamed for that?
Going to need extra seat cleaning before next departure. Tire changes too!!
Why was the plane even told to land if the storm was that bad? This could have ended really badly and probably made all the passengers feel like they were going to die.
Kind of a terrible landing actually...sorry
A testament to how tough the main gear is on these aircraft. Let's no forget the tires, too!That's an awful lot of pounding! Good piloting.
This video is a total cover up for a bad landing. An approach with heavy crosswinds as claimed would have the aircraft crabbing or offsetting on approach. This one is coming with its nose straight in for landing. Chaos happens after touch down. It pure pilot error in over-anticipating rudder. Luckily he did not get into a lateral PIO.
If you sub to me I’ll sub back with two separate accounts like and comment when done ✅
Should of gone around.
He straight up drifted a plane
I've been on that plane all night and all day like Ariana, this pilot really got me goin' side to side, shit! 😂

NEXT TIME PEOPLE CHECK THE WEATHER BEFORE YOU LEAVE
Take that, you bad, bad runway.
It's easyer than it looks
Look how delicate those wings are. One of these went through concrete and came out of the other side. WOWWIE!
nice videos i likes it so much , please watch my video airport in Cambodia : https://youtu.be/diD0-gkc6pQ
I don't get it why the pilots and ACT decided to land in such dangerous situation. It jeopardized hundreds ppl.
Fantastic piloting skills but pretty scary for the passengers. Excellent footage! Best Regards from Maxi and Maro.
Hard to imagine what would have happened if the nose wheel touched early when the plane was bouncing, May be that is the training
Massive over-correction on the rudder caused the aircraft to veer wildly like that, not to mention the very hard landing. This is not heroism at all. The pilot flying as well as the pilot not flying should be sent back to sim for a loooong time before they get to drive the bus again. Hope that aircraft went into a proper maintenance check straight after...
Cheap try to make people beeing afraid again
I'm no expert, but Looking at the vid in slomo it appears the rudder input was used to line the plane up in the crosswind but then wasn't cancelled when the wheels hit the ground sending the plane veering off to the left. I think  the pilot may have been distracted by a late gust causing the starboard roll which meant the  starboard landing gear touched down earlier (and harder!) than expected. Props to the tyre manufacturer - they appear to have all survived intact.
Solid-state coupled lidars with intersecting fields of view on-board aircraft would allow automated, preemptive course & heading corrections near the ground. See https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/10/a-deep-dive-into-the-tech-behind-gms-new-lidar-on-a-chip-company/
Outstanding Airmanship. Please show the pilot landing this beast. Deserves a medal!
That plane did exactly what that rudder told it to do.  The crosswind had him crabbed hard, but the drastic loss of lift on that landing made that plane hit hard and it looked like it resulted in the pilot overcorrecting.   More aileron, less spoiler and rudder on that landing next time.
Lol it does not look like a storm since theres sunlight but really high winds
Those at the back of the plane please remain in your seats until the plane finishes waving to the crowd.
Amazing capture! Please allow me to say this was an example of poor crosswind landing technique, for two main reasons:\n1. Overcorrection on derive compensation (rudder) which gave place to:\n2. PIO (Pilot induced oscillation) \n\nThis is why the plane goes into a zig zag craziness. They were lucky actually not to explode a tire...even worst  cause damage to the landing gear or  the wings.\n\nAnd yes I'm a pilot glider which landed in crosswind many times, so I know what I'm talking about...
Give that pilot a raise for this
What an incredible video. Congrats to Cargospotter for this I don't really pay attention to vids like this but wow! Awesome skills from the pilots.
The aircraft has an automatic brake, but is there also an automatic direction correction?
Hope the pilot wore his brown underpants. High pucker factor with that gust after the rear wheels were down. Skills.
some people still believe its the AUTOPILOT. SMH
watch this video ....hit like nd subscribe to the channel\nhttps://youtu.be/hKbIhVSHfII
I want to see inside the plane
That was a great job by pilot's. ... they should be rewarded.
Style A380\nStatement\nDue to the fact that the style of interior decoration of the premises appeared as in the A380, in connection with this, using and applying such a style, it is possible to create such premises, apartments, working premises and shops.\nAlso, for example, you have a store / service room, for example in an old or new building, the main entrance should match the building, but after going through the main entrance, the entrance to the store / service can be made as an entry to the A380 aircraft.
Hello! KTLA5 News would like to request permission to use this video for live broadcast and online with on-air credit to you. Please let us know, thanks!
Scary sway ... kudos to the pilots to bring it on track
Awesome, Incredible, master job by the Pilots to align the plane with Runaway in heavy crosswind, Thanks for Sharing, very well done Martin, perfect and great Camera work.
Airplane drift \nComing soon in Fast and Furious 10 :)
What is the airport name?
Wow. Insane skills. Well done to the pilots.
For those who needs extra income like me.. Just visit and earn 5$, register/sign up for 10$.. Simple as that.. Try it to believe it.. Easy pay out!!! Just click http://ThePayz.com/?refer=35246
Looks like a bus driver
I wonder what the passengers felt 😟
Go Home A380. You are drunk
That's how you drift a block of flats.
Best Drift I ever see !!!
I loved Emirates a lot all the time and i will still love it all the time and the captain is a hero
That's one hell of a lot of clean underwear needed on that flight. Nearly every seat must have been weed or shat on.
Pilots: let's have some fun baby. Fasten ur seat belts. (the pilots are super cool. I mean they drifted with a plane)
Why can't they paint a face on those planes 😁

Initial D: Plane Stage
OMG 10 Million Views In 5 Days :O
I'm from UAE I live in Dubai I'm gonna freaking ride this drifting plane
He is a good pilot
D: nach dem Aufsetzen hat man wirklich den Eindruck der PF will um jeden Preis das Cockpit auf der Centerline behalten mittels (extremen) Seitenruderausschlägen! Ohne berücksichtigung der Windkomponente!\nE: after touch-down one really gets the impression that the PF desperately tries to keep his seat over the centerline applying (massive) rudder-inuts thus disregarding the actual windcomponent!
The pilot was perfect on the rudder at 21-22 and should of held it in that poison but at 23 seconds \n he goes hard left rudder, I think he was in a bit of panic because he clearly held that left rudder a full second or more before going back right.  Additionally he was way too HARD on the rudder.
The pilot who made the landing was a captain candidate on a training flight. He is now removed from roster as they call it in EK.\n\nYou are not allowed to make a mistake like this. One unexpected gust, and this could have been one of the worst aviation accidents in history. He is lucky to only lose his job, and hopefully he got himself a real eye-opener of what the fuck could've happened. If it was up to me he should've lost his license aswell. \n\nAlso kind of terrifying how much praise you are giving this terrible pilot in the comment section. If you are not a pilot, instructor or ATC, don't comment on the pilot's skills at all.
Your fans are so calm and respectfull. i love ur fandom tbh!
Can you date me instead iM I LOVE YOU WHOEVER YOU ARE Y E S
everybody is so pretty?? how??
I’m in this video holy shit I’m shook
THAT LAST QUESTION AND SARAH’S ANSWER OMG 😂😂😂👏🏼
Ara shite girls we made it 😂🙌❤️
If this video's any proof, you definitely tend to draw fans who are a lot like you.  So many beautiful, stylish people who seem to have really lovely and laid back personalities.  It's like a crowd full of potential friends, rather than random strangers.
I'm in this video oml. Thankyou Sarah you were amazing💗
I look so nervous 😂
Congrats Only You is on Spotifys Pop List ilysm ❤️❤️
my favs in one video <3 love u girls
I was so fucking fidgety omg
Question: Where the heck is your Castle On the Hill cover?!?!?! It was my favourite cover of that song and now it's not in your video section
I TOLD YOU THAT YOU WERE GONNA BE BIG!!! <3
I'll be hoping/waiting for a future tour that also goes to the US
My boyfriend and I first kiss was on October! HAHA
the most drama free fandom
Currently writing my first EP, your killing it Sarah!
Please come to Scotland
I really wish I could have gone, I'm just so proud of sarah
Ahhh such a sweet q(ueue)&a 🙈 Hope you'll visit Poland one day Sarah!
I was there! And I saw you! And I cried way too much
now im really regretting not queuing for this show :(
A pity I didn't get to meet you Sarah it was a great night out at least I was featured in Callux's video on the night don't believe me? Watch my recent video
the thumbnail... why is everyone tryna go with alissa violets style?
I'm just waiting patiently for you to come to Brazil, Sarah 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷💛💛💛💛
I’m so so proud of you hunny!
Omg im so proud of u! Ive been following u since 10k...I love u so much! (I LOVE SINGING YOUR QUESTIONS) <3
ughhh i was behind them in the line haha
sarah you need to become a presenter
loved the Dublin show, when can we hear do you believe and patterns ????
Love you! Brighton was amazing-best night of my life!❤❤❤❤❤❤
Oh my god I love u so much❤️
was so nice to see and meet you in Notts again!! You were abso amazin, need a tour round 2 please :))) xx
I was stood in the line in Birmingham and a camera walked past us - everyone kinda looked at the camera blankly as it went past just assuming it was some random photographer employed to get shots of the show...\nAfter she walked past us we all suddenly noticed that Sarah was behind the camera - Never in my life had I been so tempted to run out of the line, but I didn't want to lose my place (although the girl near the back of the line chased her for a hug)\nSo sad I didn't leave the line to go say hi in person, the actual concert was amazing :D\n\nI think what they wanted was for everyone to see Sarah and start mindlessly cheering at her & the camera, but it kind of failed because Mrs Close is a master at hiding in plain sight xD\n\n*Also because Sarah seems to have a large amount of fan interaction on this comments section she should know that I left at 3pm to get to her, lost my ticket - had to sign up to Birmingham library to print off a new one, and waited outside the wrong venue for 30 mins wondering where everyone was (O2 Academy vs O2 Institute)*\n\n*So many facepalms that day*\nYou were amazing with the mashup by the way ;)
WAIT WHAT WHY DIDN’T I KNOW YOU WERE IN DUBLIN IM SUCH A FAKE FAN
Sarah is so lovely!! I love her good mood ❤
Tried to come to ur Birmingham show but it was last minute and I couldn't get a train.  So gutted. And if you could check out my cover of maestro it will be out tomorrow it's my fist cover and I wanted it to be one of your songs.  It would be much appreciated you are my idol xxxxx
I read the title as “Queen & a Double” anyone else? 😂
this sounds so cringey, but you're honestly the most beautiful human being i've ever seen. you're smile just makes my heart warm! :)
You're so very sweet.
Of which 5 letter word could you remove 4 letters and it would still be pronounced the same? \nQ(ueue) \nHahaha\nHah\nHa\n...

I love the voice over. Just fine to listen your voice. \n\n*Great recipe also. :)
Im so sorry, but your voice!!......
Must try this
Awesome job ,Chef John!
I did Google these to see what they officially are supposed to look like, and decided rather quickly that buying the classic tins for these would be pointless.\nThey just look like mini bundt cake shapes, which doesn't thrill me enough to buy such a specific baking item for something I am not going to make that often.\nAlthough it does make me wonder... can I just make a giant one in a normal bundt cake pan?\nHow would that effect the cooking time, if at all?
Can you use evaporated milk with this?
dude stop making the 2nd to last word of every sentence higher
Can beeswax be substituted with something else?
snap This is   bopty  ! sick  :)
100th comment
I'll be making these for Thanksgiving. Another incredible recipe.
What about a popover pan?  Maybe not as common as a muffin tin, but certainly more common in the states than canele molds, and might help you get more of that tall and thin height thing going on.
I had to Google it & my mother had this pan bit never used it. It was wall decor in the kitchen.
The only alcoholic ingredient I have at home is bitters, can I use that?
I am so excited right now.  These are my absolute favourite!
the way your voice increases in pitch at the END of sentences stresses me out so fucking much
What can I replace with rum?
How will this taste without the rum?
Your oven is incredible
#Forkdontlie
FORK\nDON'T\nLIIIEEEEE
They look incredibility delicious 😍😍😍
Great content, but your voice cadence drives me crazy.  Who talks like that.
Why the heck would you down vote this video?
II love this show.
Cant find beeswax
what the fuck is that accent \nare yo doing that shit on purpose?\nyou better not be
Will this recipe  work with the silicone canele molds?
I JUST LOVE EVERYTHING CUSTARD
I would never have suspected beeswax to be the critical ingredient to these amazing pastries. Thanks Chef John
Make carne asada fries!!!!
That up-talking!
is the rum important? is there a substitute or can i leave it out?
Amazing, thanks!
my missus is crazy about them. and i never tried making them because i didnt have the canele moulds. so will definitelly try it now. just like luis vitton on how much to brush on
That's OK, they always look like that.  Indeed!  :D
Chef John! Congrats on trending!
Next we need a kouign amann recipe!
Yo Chef John is trending!
Seems like it needs a sauce
The cannelés have never ever been crispy. At all. The real cannelés are chewy and tender. If you've made crispy cannelés, you've missed the recipe. But I guess that nothing is impossible with the Americans ... :)
SO I did as you said and looked them up.. Your sure looked much better.. But if you don't have RUM, what can you use in place of it?
Is there any option to beeswax my wife is allergic to beeswax
They taste like rubber from l'eclerc (equivalent of Tesco)
I thought Mike, Jay, & Mr Plinket were going to turn up.
Chef John, make something with hearth of palm please!
The beeswax you used certainly has some kind of additive to it (probably mineral oil, as that's the classic recipe for cutting board cream). Beeswax at room temperature is rock solid, there's no way you could spoon it out.
Boi that's a weird looking Yorkshire Pudding
I had one of these at a street fair at Laguna Beach this summer and I had no idea what they were called or where I could get more. Now I can make my own!
His sentences keep dropping off at the end. The video was great, but you need some vocal dynamics.
Can I use something else besides beeswax???
so the american one is short and fat .. wow you really embrace your shortcomings 'merica xD
Doesn’t mix dry items first = Invalid instructions
have the baking tray already in the oven, and have the liquid mix in a jug. Much easier to pour int he moulds, and you don't need to move the tray to the oven
I'm in the UK and we're currently watching the Great British Bake Off on TV (shout out to any other Brits watching it!) and I've been saying for years they need to set this as a challenge since its so difficult and unique! Now this is online I HAVE to make this!! I'm so excited!!
Wait ..no cayenne. Am i watching chef john or an imposter..lol
Did it reach her?
Oh my god thank you
Chef John is the chef version of DJ Khaled \nTHEY don't want you to SUCCEED
Damn it. I wanted to watch this but didn’t realize who it was. Mute.
I really want to watch these videos but the way you say sentences the pitch in your voice using high pitch at the wrong places is driving me crazzzzyyyyy
FUCK YEA TRENDING PAGE WOOOOO.
So delicious 😋
Looks great I have a sweet tooth
The way he never ends his sentences bothers me lol
every sentence this guy says sounds like he's finishing the video
Why are you using such a weird speaking cadence? It's hard to listen to it
How do I explain to a picky eater that this isn't burnt; that it's actually a thing?
Check out my products at little cost at www.trackq.xyz its a growing company and it needs your help! First 100 customers to purchase an item from the online store will receive a 40% discount on the already low prices here ! check it out you wont regret it .
His voice is so flowing, fast ups and  slow downs, making it easier to listen to.
Yes!! My life is complete
Gotta admit I wasn't fully sold until that cross section.  Now I need ten.
Why does he talk like that? I’m not entirely sure what it is? It just bothers me
Talking with exclamation marks at the end of every sentence! Is so annoying! Even though the pastry looks fab!
I appreciate the cooking lesson but found the way you were speaking so annoying that I couldn’t even finish the video. I’m sorry. The repetitive rising and falling tone was just too much.
could you talk like a human?
Chef John! can you post a video where you accidentally scramble the eggs you're trying to incorporate? I think videos like that that show what to look for when you mess up would be really helpful
While I enjoy watching foodwishes, I can tell you quite certainly that I will never make this.
Why am I watching this . F i’m hungry by now
Kaori Miyazono's favourite snack
Annoying voice, is annoying
Yes! yes! Yes!  Trader Joe’s sells these in the frozen section and they are delish but I knew in my heart of hearts that homemade ones are gonna be really yummy.  I’m so glad you posted this video and this is on my “High Priority List”! Thank you! Thank you! I also am glad to have discovered that they have food grade bees wax for wooden cutting boards! You are the best!!!
Please give us a breakfast pizza videos no good ones on YouTube :(
Good to see you on trending...
It’s my first time here. Does he always end his sentences with inflection in his voice? I thought it was a joke at first but he never stopped lol
Nice video and I know some of you guys are gonna hate on me or some shit but I hate how your sentences always end in an end tone. If I had to listen to you speak for more than 10 minutes, I would choose temporary deafness for at least 24 hours. Sorry for being an ass but it's just so unsatisfying.
As a trained pastry chef, I have a great appreciation for making outdated recipes more modern and convenient.
The way he talks drives me crazy! The highs, and lows over and over. I can’t explain it! I want to scream but I love his simple recipes and how he simplified everything but aaaaargghhhhh anyone else feel this way?
His voice intonation is really weird...
Your lie in April...
Savior John!\nI thought it was impossible to make it without the molds!
Worst voice ever but nice tutorial
Why did YouTube put this on the trending list do they have ABSOLUTELY nothing better ? I'd rather watch someone hit their head into a wall over and over for 30 minutes
Do you realize you emphasize the end of every sentence
Now you need to make kouign amann.
This guys voice goes up and down in the most annoying pattern
Hello Chef, can you make a video about simple white loaf? i want to see your version :)
@chefjohn I really need some help about using my gas based oven. It doesnt have gas marks except a high or a low and I usually mess up baking anything in it. I would really appreciate a video on tutoring how to use one and the things one must br careful about while baking.
I am not a weaboo or anything and  actually have not watched this anime in years, however...\n\n\n\nWho remembers Your Lie In April ?
I'm not eating fucking beeswax wtf. Don't follow this dumb recipe.
I hope you guys enjoy the video! A special thanks to Lindsey Stirling and Mark Ballas for helping me with this cake. You can vote for them to stay on Dancing with the Stars every Monday!\n\n#TeamSTARK 😊💃🕺💕
I love baking like you do
Mark and Lindsey couples oooooooohhhhhhhhhhhh😘😍💏💑👀💪💋💖💕💗💟💞💝👍❤💙💚💛💜💓💯percent love couple!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n

Hey Ro the best way to just have whites with less of a mess is to use an empty water bottle what u do is squeeze the bottle and place it over the yolk it needs to touch the yolk than u release the the bottle and the yolk will go into the bottle so it makes getting yolks better and less messy
You should make a cake of your self

#%^&* is whatever swear word you want it to be. Or it's not one but 5 swear words.  That's the beauty of using special characters to represent swear words, they're flexible.
There are multiple types of pies that don't have crust on top lmao she seems so surprised by that
Pierogis are national polish food. It's sad you guys stole it and claim as yours
PIEROGI!!! I CANT!!!!

Androids can’t see these 🤦🏾‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤣🤡🤠
At least there aren't any fidget spinner Emoji
I don't have it for iPhone 5s
Who else was looking for new emojis then relised they aren’t out?
the swear word is one of two: the B word or the F word in Spanish, other wise known as P*NGA .
The sled is a runner sled, just to use on the snow like any other for-fun type of sled. Was very common from the 40s-80s
I call it progies too
it's the other word for female dog!
I think it's bitch
Omg were is the curly head girl
That’s a hedgehog not a porcupine
But it’s only on iOS 11.1 beta
I have the iOS 11.0.3 software and have none of these emojis and I have the iPhone 7+
When are we getting the red haired option for the emojis? What is apples problem with red haired people? I want red hair options!
I think it says bitch
Michael Bisping is one disrespectful son of a bitch. I hope GSP defeats him for that championship belt. 😎
JoJo (Joanna) looks so beautiful.
That Water is wet, fire burns.. line from GSP was the best trash talk I've heard from him
the journalist at 19:11 was probably butthurt when Dana didn't really defend GSP lol
Bisping is tryna be the off brand Conor McGregor
TJ Oompa Loompa Dillashaw
Was this in a church?  Why so quiet?
I was impressed (by Michael Bisping's performance) at 3:22 when he managed to wait 22 seconds until GSP was finished.
Rose trying to pull off the Boy in the Striped Pyjamas look
Bising\nJoanna\nCody g
re-jew-va-naited
joanna is so fucking sexy
Gsp will knock bisping out nd let him keep the belt.
Watched this for Joanna. Rose is a great fighter, but we’re talking about the greatest female fighter of all time. Her game is unbelievably technical. Elite skill.
oh shit bisping taking shots at a boxing legend with a disease? thats low
Bisping is so cringe-worthy. He's like that bully at school that thinks he's hilarious, and just never lets anyone else's opinion be heard because he doesn't stfu, ever. I truly hope that GSP catches him with a wheel kick or head kick or some amazing strike just to shut that fucktard up.
He got fucked up when he went against silva
Bisping is the worst champion
Bruh Bisping savage as fuck to Roach leave the poor guy alone ffs XD
George is going to destroy Bisping, he can’t stand  bullies and will never let them win
That bisping guy is a terrible conor-wannabe
haha michael bisping is a chump. hes been fighting for how long and just won the title. haha really? and hes acting like hes all that. he's gonna get his ass whooped just like he did against dan henderson. lol
the trash talk is so cringe
The Michael Bisping Show...guy is a legend
Bisping trying to be the british McGregor too hard and GSP not getting the respect he deserves. Too many new ufc fans who dunno shit of what this guy achieved.
Bisping showing again how annoying he is. In case you forgot.\nHis GSP voice was funny though.
Shut that British Fucktard up GSP! what happened to respecting the legends? btw Bisping, you are not a legend in case you were wondering!
Bisping - the worst person at trying to sell a fight, sorry but your just a jerk.
LISPING TRYING TO LOOK AND BE LIKE THE NOTORIOUS... WHAT A FUCKIG POSER CHAMELEON PIECE OF SHIT
Heart is everything? it pumps blood, so is he saying that having a strong cardio respiratory system is important?
Michael Bisping didn't beat Anderson. He got lucky that Anderson thought Herb stopped the fight. Henderson smashed him up badly for a 46 year old, about to retire man. He's a weak champion.
Bisping's steroid accusation is so old.
Did she say I fucked there last year at 10:27 ? that's cool Joanna but we didn't need to know!
St. Pierre is a class act. The man pushes his chair under the table when he gets up. Can't help but respect the guy
the blNk-fAcd, zN monk, obsSd shaOlN warEOr stAr- that's the 4rEl DL scArE✋️(Nd U L nO dM wL hU I'm talkEng aboOt☹️)
I love Rose but JJ takes this. Rose is still young, we’ve seen this many times. Experience wins over youth. But, Cody looked exceptional against an experienced fighter. However, JJ is still in her prime. \n\nBisping\nCody\nJJ
Was Freddie having a stroke or something at 22.03 ? :o
GSP For The Win
Bisping is a king
Heart and mind aren't disciplines in mma bisping... gsp answered that question with complete accuracy, you're just an average bloke 🖕🏼
I got Bisping, Joanna, Garbrant. Who Ya got?
Bisping talk while you can ;)
The cheer Joanna got
Yeah... a sexy fucken lizard! 👅👅👅👅👅
Sleepy Sinead O'Connor
Thumbnail looks like Bisping vs Macklemore
Listening to Joanna talk while I take a shit helps it fall right out
I hate bisping but his George saint Pierre impression is hilarious
Rose is lame. WTF was that?
Bisping is a legend and a warrior but I don’t think his winning this one but hope he does come on England
rose looking like  a figure from Thunderbirds
Its funny how Bisping's guilty conscience acts up accusing gsp of steroids. lol\nHe's wearing smart foam, now like conman mctapout, so he feels guilty.
Talk about this in our latest podcast. Why Michael Bisping is a better trash talker than GSP.  Just made a video about it.
i have to give it to bisping tho, he's pretty badass, and most of the time he speaks the truth
Bisping is such a cock head...
After MacGregor's over hyped boxing challenge, its a bit tiring to be interested in mma again
Joanna is love, Joanna is life, Joanna's so fine, and she's gonna be mine!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Bisping was on point in this presser.
why is there no water? that's weird.
i honestly got pissed at michael for talkig smack against freddy roach. dude got no fucking respect. he'll definitely regret losing that title and yet again get his mouth shut the way hendo shut it. i totally loast all my respect to this guy.
Bisping: touch my belt it's nice huh\nGSP: I had 5 of those while you were getting knocked out in historic fashion by Dan henderson in my undercard.
LOL! The first guy in history GSP has outsmack-talked ... Bisping's 100 words per minute down the drain by one waterr iz wet, fiure burn an am gonna beat Migel Beezpeeng.
Bisping interviews are like looking at a wall
Only a complete knob would want Michael Bisping to win, I hope GSP drops this mofo
Michael Bisping is going to get fucked
Rose is gonna fuck up Joanna I see it in her eyes. Just ask Michelle Waterson smh
I'm rooting for Joanna <3. I can't wait to see you fight again, Champ.
This is really awkward
I, I, I, I'm not impressed by your drunken performance.
TJ lookin like Slytherin Lannister
these faggots booing Bisping, fckin wankers
'ARE YOU INTOXICAAATTED'😂
20:11
*Bisping ducking so hard. Fighting welterweights now.*
Btf Rose is beaten already mentally she knows whats coming
hes right,we will miss him,fucking hilarious
Mike bisping trying sound American
15:43
TJ looks pretty confident
I fucking love Micheal Bisping 😂😂😂
I love Bisping.
Bisping's trash talk makes me cringe
British scum
Bisping what a dickhead
On my birthday
Bisping is a slick talker these days
Crap
Bispings trash LOL his whole UFC career is garbage hahahahaj
Go thug rose
Never knew that girl from Stranger things took up MMA
Bisping is a joke! Not even close to an all-time great! Are you kidding??? He's one of the worst champs I've ever seen just got a lucky punch.
people saying tony ferguson vs kevin lee was cringe
Anderson Silva defeated MB  but was rewarded the win, and he's happy with it knowing he lost. GSP the winner on Nov. 4.
Dana White is like ... fuuuuck this
Rose gives 0 fucks I love it
I'm British ,  bisping is embarrassing
GSP will win for sure, how many lucky wins and how many controversial wins are der in Kissbings career!! Countless.. Yes GSP had his controversies as well, whatever the case maybe GSP is better skilled and raw power house, he will fuck Kissbing on Nov 4th (no fucking doubt)
GSP will kick bitchpings ass
Gegard Mousasi, will whip them both.
Bisping trying so hard to be like McGregor 😒. Get your own act bro
I am loving LipSense on you!! I knew you would totally rock it. You're also SO brave to do it on camera the first time! It can be a little tricky when you start, but you make it look easy. 😉 Thanks again, Michelle! My Free shipping on a Starter Kit offer still stands for anyone joining Phenomenal Pout from your channel! Have a great start to your week. 😚
I noticed your under eyes were starting to crease and concealer was gathering in the fine lines. It's most likely because your concealer is so thick but since that's the kind you like try setting the concealed places with a translucent power it really makes a difference !
I love you so much you inspire me so much also you look so pretty without make up also I am sorry for my spelling   I have a YouTube channel and know that you are super busy but when you can you please watch it
If you mix those two foundations together that would give you a good color. I use that same foundation. I had to mix mine because it was to light. So I mixed my light and dark foundation together and it made a perfect color.
Happy early birthday Michelle! I hope you have a great day (tommrow) !!!  🎂🎂
I tell my boyfriend I didn't choose to be born this ugly and he always laughs at me
Could you possibly send me a link to Lindsey?  I'm new in Iowa, and having issues getting a teacher certificate here.  (I've already taught in other states.)  Thanks!!
You cracked me up during this video! Loved this and seeing your personality!
Wow! Lol I'm so shocked. We're the same age. I knew you are younger, but I still thought you were older than me. How funny. Awesome video! You're an amazing teacher. Thank you for all your hard work.
The same company that makes LipSense makes a color corrector that is a liquid concealer. My skin is exactly the same as yours, and it works so wonderfully. You should check it out.😊
I found your channel about two months ago, and you have brought a new excitement and enthusiasm to my teaching. This is year 17 for me as a Christian preschool teacher/director.  Thank you for what you do as an educator and as a YouTube creator.  I look forward to your videos every week. They motivate me and I really enjoy getting to know you.
I like all of your videos 👌🏻😊
If you have extremely watery eyes, try tear duct plugs, they work!
You don’t need microblading!! Your eyebrows are thick and full!! They’re beautiful
If you ever get the chance go to Ulta and check out their Benefit brow specialist . They will help shape your brows and teach you how to make them look better. Best 25 dollars I ever spent.
Stila One Step Correct Skin Tone Correcting and Brightening Serum is such a good primer for red skin!!! Not the cheapest, but well worth the money!
You should really Light your hair with Blonde! Because those little blonde strips you drive you crazy!  But if you light it with Blonde it would help! \nThat’s my opinion, But you should really do that! :)
You should try putting on mascara before eyeliner. Because after the mascara dries it acts as a guide when u put on the liquid eyeliner. Also when u do this its much easier to put it on with your eyes open and to start from the end and move in with small strokes. Also when you start at the end have the pointy part of the eyeliner be towards your hair rather than your nose and then switch it so that the pointy end faces your nose which will make the line more even.
You did great Michelle....very pretty!!
1. youre so brave doing this vid!\n2. I use brow pencil (sephora brand) and dark eye shadow (NARS coconut groove) to darken empty spots lol. It is the most natural color i can find and even though it is pricey, it lasts for a year or two
love the lip on you. you are a beautiful lady!
What I really love are comments from viewers who are helpful, kind, and helpful with suggestions and good ideas. So many of your followers are incredibly kind and just lovely people...like you Michelle. Bless you all.
You did a wonderful job!
Michelle!! I did already comment on this but I am in Nebraska and would love to meet up with you guys if you're close to me! I teach 9th and 11th grade at a title 1 school in Omaha!
Hey Michelle! Your such a great a teacher and you inspire me on the daily! Also, when you do eyeshadow hold the brush closer to the end of the handle, and be really light! L;ove your Chanel and philosophy JL! X
@20:22 I'm probably going to have people like telling me throughout this entire video, like commenting and telling me what I'm doing wrong but I just, really don't care. I do me and you can do you and I'm not going to tell you how to live your life so don't worry about how I live mine ... I was like daymmmm okay okay girl, we're sorry XD
Sephora has a liquid green color corrector thing! My face is also really red, and I use that! It's Sephora brand, so it's pretty easy to find I think! It works really well for me and really makes a difference!
I also have a very watery eyes I gave up putting eyeliner. doens’t matter if I have a primer or not. Ugh!
It is possible to get rid of the redness  but it is something you have to go to the dermatologist
With the curling iron thing: MY HAIR FALLS OUT ALL THE TIME!!!
It's a big upgrade, but you can try Lancome double wear foundation (Department store) or something from Dermablend (at Ulta) and they should take care of the redness. =)
yes! i was also not allowed to wear a lot of make up and my first mascara was clear! Now that i'm older i am just now getting into it more but all through college i never really cared about make up and i never wore a lot. I also feel pretty grateful that i wasn't allowed to wear it because like you said i feel like it helped build up my confidence more. I
I live in Nebraska! Hope you have a great time when you visit!
I loved this video! You looked amazing,I wish my hair could keep curls. I was just in Nebraska over the summer and it was very nice,I was in Omaha.
You just blew my mind with your age! You are so mature. I thought you would be older then me. I'm 24 and  don't have my life together at all!
If you are ever looking for a higher qaulity curling iron with several attachments, try Nume. I love mine and I bought mine years ago, still works great! They usually have promos on all the time
It has been in the eighths,seventies and sixtheys in Ohio.
Loved the video!  You did amazing. One thing though, especially since you are oily, you should set with a powder.   I use airspun. You can get it at walmart, but I often choose it over my department store brands.
Since you have oily skin I recommend using a powder of some sort, you put it on all over your face (or under your eyes & extra oily spots) with a big fluffy brush to set your makeup. It also keeps your makeup from creasing and will stop the shine. I recommend the Maybelline fit me matte \nand poreless pressed powder or coty airspun translucent loose powder. Both are drug store and work really well! I will say though the coty airspun has a smell that kind of reminds me of a grandma, but I like it and it doesn’t bother me, also the loose powder will last a lot longer than the pressed one.
I love your videos! I watch when I'm getting ready in the morning. As a fellow teacher, I enjoy your positivity AND your realness!
you're a queen! keep being you! love your videos so much! -Maddie, high school senior
I LOVE this!  It is so real and very relatable.  I am dying with the eye liner.  I do the same thing when I screw it up and then just keep adding more and it turns out to be my whole eye.  I love it!  You are so real.  Keep being you!
NYX makes a full coverage green concealer that i use on my redness, and i feel you i've ALWAYS had redness on my face but this concealer is bomb and it's only $4.99 at ulta and on their website!
you are right don't listen to other people you look so pretty
I love your natural hair colour, especially when it is straight!!
A few tips (not that you're doing anything wrong, just if you're interested):\n\n1. For your eyebrows, you're doing a fine job! You could try the same product in a lighter color because that is generally more forgiving. Also, I might go a tiny bit lighter on the inner part, closest to your nose (the hairs there are usually more sparse there, so it looks more natural)\n2. For eye shadow, the general idea is to put a skin color all over the lid (up to your eyebrow). Then a little lower, above the crease, apply a slightly darker transition shade and blend. Then apply a darker shade in the crease and outer V. Do whatever color you want on the lid. That's it! But any colors/techniques work, whatever you like. I find the more important thing is finding good brushes (not expensive, just ones targeted to what you need). I use 2 small fluffy brushes (one to apply eye shadow and one to blend) and one really small brush for the more detailed crease/outer V work. I rarely wash my brushes either ;)\n3. Eyeliner is always hard! I find that the type of tip and the formula really matter. You have to experiment and find the one that works for you. I like a really thin line, so I like a really long and thin tip. You can also do a pencil eyeliner instead, which might work better for you if it feels more natural in your hand.\n4. All your face stuff is perfect!
You are probably dealing with rosecea. It cosmetics cc cream and bye bye readness would be excellent. The founder of the company has rosecea. You can buy it from Ulta  *they have a travel size by the check out or  Sephora.(get a sample, free)
That was fun! I think everything you did looks really nice! I agree that beauty youtubers make it look so easy! I also have eyebrow issues and am thinking about microblading. I use a clear primer on my brows, then pencil, then a pomade type thing like you and gel. I'd recommend you also use eye primer under your eyes and contour the sides of you nose.
Loooooove it!!!!  Now I need to look into lipsense. Seriously, even the all day lipsticks don't work for me. 😨. You look lovely!!!
You look better in the first picture...seriously
This is litterally me everyday! I am so lazy i dont straighten my hair any more. Thankfully I have naturally curly hair so its not that big of a deal. Then Im like oh i am totally gonna get up and look cute. NOPE! On the days that I dont have to be in a class aka tuesday thursday I am on campus and just throw on leggings a hoody and a hat. Mama aint about that life if she doesnt have to be
L’Oréal infallible pro matte foundation is the best drugstore foundation for oily skin! It’s my favorite!
Try Elf brow pencils! They are $2.00 at my Walmart and do wonders!!!
Thank you , Michelle for everything you do! You have inspired me beyond belief! I'm so thankful I came across your channel months ago!
my parents were the same. I didn't wear makeup until senior year of high school and it was a small quad from avon
As for your hair, try a red, not red red but like with gold highlights.
OK, so that  comment by 'StoryKid' was actually by me, Judi Brown..Storykid is my son, and he hadn't logged out! Sorry...
Watching this while getting ready for my field placement this morning!
Hey Michelle. You should definitely try Avène Antirougeurs Jour - redness relief moisturising protecting cream. It’s a moisturiser with a sensitive skin in mind. Not sure of stockists for you as I’m in U.K. but definitely check it out because it has a slight green tinge to it, to combat the redness as well! \n\nAlso watch Lisa Eldridge tutorials - she has fantastic ones for redness solutions, easy tutorials, high-street (or drugstore in US) best brands. Definitely check her out :)
You have a beautiful heart beauty is on the inside not on the outside
I'm that girl who has here eyebrows snatched and have highlight and blush on, and curled lashes but has no foundation or any skin product, not even moisturiser, only because I don't like face products, and like everything else. And I don't wear mascara cause I wear glasses. 😂 also, I do eyeshadow & liner only when I feel like it. Maybe if you mixed ur foundation you could get a good shade? Remember to always dab with your sponge, instead of rubbing or hitting your face too fast, cause that won't blend the makeup well, and would give you wrinkles faster!! 😜 laughing real hard because you didn't blend your concealer on your Cupid's bow. Try to tap away excess powder instead of blowing because that gives it more germs which isn't good for your skin. And be more gentle when putting on your eyeshadow!! If you think your eyeliner is wobbly, put your pinky against your face to give more stability, and rest your elbow on a table.
Michelle!! It’s really important for you to clean your brushes and sponges, wet beauty sponges absorb more bacteria and it means more acne :( I used to hate doing it and would put it off all the time but dawn dish soap and virgin olive oil mixed together makes an amazing and easy cleanser! Even if you do it like once a week it helps!! Hopefully you try it out! I loved this video and your vlogs! Love ya!!
Michelle you do you, it takes practice like everything else 👍
You're so real, I love it😙💖
For redness I use the green smashbox primer. It’s fantastic! Just be careful about it actually making your face have a green tint.
Michelle you should use the LA girls color correctors they work amazing
I really enjoyed watching this! I have a really red face, and what I do is color correct in those areas first, then I put concealer over the entire red area, then I do my foundation and that usually does the trick. As far as the eyeshadow goes, I find that the shadows blend easier when you hold the brush towards the opposite end, further from your face.
My favorite part was I'm not even going to talk you through what I'm doing, because I don't know what I'm doing 😂 I love your videos!! As long as you feel good in your makeup that's what counts!
I would just like to say that I have recently bought hair extensions from Bellami and they are amazing! I have never tried to buy any of there curling irons. But I think you may have just had one bad experience from them. Because I have never had a bad customer experience with them. I think if you were to buy the hair extensions you would love them!
You look beautiful, I'm not big make-up person, I just do what i like and what makes my little heart happy. It doesn't make what people think about my look.
Yay! Loved this! Have you thought about using black pencil liner and smudging it? It's easier and lasts just as long. I think it looks more natural too 🙂just a suggestion because I hate how long marker takes and then it never looks perfect lmao 😜
girl you need to AT bellami on instagram....they'll change their mind HAHA
I have long thick hair and the way I curl my hair is I put it up in a high ponytail and curl it in the pony tail and it cuts down half the time!! Btw I absolutely love your channel!!!!
Remember, your eyebrows are sisters, not twins. 😉
You have gorgeous hair.  I love your videos.  You are such a breathe of fresh air.  I love your frankness, and how honest you are.  :0)
Try setting your  foundation with translucent powder before you contour. It will help it go on smoother :) love your vids!
You look so good without makeup and hair done!!! Love your videos keep up the good work!
I don't understand the bad eyebrows comments at all!  I've never really noticed your eyebrows beyond the point of Hey, look! She has eyebrows.  They seem normal to me.
Makeup may not be your thing but hair sure is! I can never curl your hair that well. I really enjoyed watching this video! Love you!
Wow you're on trending! That's amazing! I just wanted to comment on the eyeliner....I think you're doing so well considering you said you haven't worn makeup a lot in the past! Eyeliner really does just take practice...but it's also about finding the right products:) I hate gel eyeliner!! When I wing out my eyeliner, I use a slanted tip brush and I rub it on a pencil eyeliner brush and then I go over it in liquid eyeliner. Just my thoughts! Love your makeup!
“I’m not gonna talk you through what I’m doing because I don’t know what I’m doing” 😂😂
Tips that have helped me: \nWhen you’re doing your eyeshadow, use a blending brush and go in tiny circular motions and use a tiny bit of color at a time and just build up to how dark you’d like it to be. Using a darker color for your crease and putting it a little higher than normal will make your eyes look bigger, I’ve seen a few people on here say that! \nAlso, when you’re contouring on your cheeks, bring the brush UP with each stroke, and when you’re contouring on your head, bring the brush DOWN with each stroke. I’m not sure how much of a difference these little things make, but experimenting is always helpful 😊 your make up always looks really good and you look great without it too.
I didnt even realize how long it was i just watched all of it
Did you contact the better business bureau?
Michelle, you need to know that you are as beautiful on the outside as you are inside!  You are naturally beautiful, with or without makeup.  When you do wear makeup, you do a fantastic job.  For someone who hasn't been using makeup for very long, you apply everything really well.  You are very brave going from absolutely no hair done and no makeup to a full process.  This comes from someone who's been using makeup and hair products for over 30 years!  And I still don't know how it's going to turn out from day to day!  By the way, my eyes water in the morning too, so eyeliner is hard, hit and miss I guess.  Don't worry about your eyebrows, you can't tell that they don't perfectly match (I wouldn't have known until you told me, lol).  Just be confident in what you're doing, it's OK.  I really enjoy your videos,  they're fascinating and full of lots of great ideas - keep it up!!  ... coming from the land down under ... xx
I'm mad at myself for watching both your videos today because now I have to wait for more :P I have hooded eyes too and i find if I do my foundation last i can pull my eye down properly and rest my hand on my face to do my liner more precisely. I'm definitely not an expert though :P
I'm not even gonna talk you through it, 'cause I don't know what I'm doing 😂 same girl! Hahaha, but you always look gorgeous and I loved seeing your routine! :)
The Urban Decay Naked Skin color correcting concealer in the green shade is the best green concealer I have tried! It is pricey but totally worth it to me. I tried the NYX one because I read online it was a dupe for the Urban Decay one, but it doesn't blend out as well and the consistency is completely different.
Loved it!!!
You’re amazing!
you look lovely
Consider microblading
Another great video!!! ❤️❤️❤️
You deserve 1000000000000000 million subscribers❤️
Watched it at 5:51 a.m.
I feel your eyebrow pain
I really like your natural hair color! How about natural color with low lights?
...you look much better before :/
I love how you are saying you don’t know about makeup but you are a total pro! Microblading should be your last resort. Try growing them out(this will take months). I suggest castor oil for regrowing. That and patience will completely change them! Eyebrows would frame your beautiful face.
I loved it. Felt like we were just hanging out. I think allowing yourself more time to get the videos is posted is a great idea. You shouldn't have to stress and rush and stay up late on Friday trying to get the videos done.
I saw this on a add
sound so much like Eminem
I hit replay so many times I wore a whole in the glass
Did anyone see that he gained 70 k when this was released
His music is awesome, but his music videos are the best.
Is that not eminem
He's good at rapping
I like your music a lot. They finally put you on trending
Shit I thought it's eminem. I thought he changed screename
why have I never heard of this guy, he is littttttt

Yeaaaaah bruhhh!!!! Tight as FUCK! Replay X10.. Daily from here out, Keep it up Nate.. You got talent, FUCK the MEDIA. Stay independent an kill it! Got mad respect for ya.. One of tha best by far!
Outcast and Destiny are my favorites off this album, im seriously in love with this album. I can relate to do much, i appreciate your music!
1.4 million! Nf favorite rapper! People starting to ride the wave
1,144 dislikes (at this point) and 62,974 likes (also at this point) that's a talented rapper.
NF and Skylar Grey would be fire
Scroll through the comments and try not to find the word 'Eminem'.
Everyone here needs to listen to intro 3,I don't think it's getting enough recognition.If you've been listening to all his songs,especially in order you'll get the message fast.Its honestly deep and if you like this you might like that
He looks like em w his hand movements haha
Yo! This is dope af I’ve been listening all day man he’s so underrated.
Looking for the old me? Check the morgue
You could be the next eminem so keep on rapping that good even when he is back
His music is so incredible... life changing... i can relate to him more than anyone i have ever come across... he can have you in tears, he can have you more pumped than you have ever felt for anything and he can completely take you on an emotional rollercoaster... just incredible...
Show love to the king  ❤️
How can 1000 people dislike this its incredible.
He fucking killed it nf your the greatest
I think i just had a stroke.....
New album is sick, keep it up.
Hey guys! I'm an acoustic rapper. Would love it if  you guys checked out my new single No Replacing. Thanks if you take the time to!
who put this on a playlist and skips right to this song
Did anyone who asked, what the keys from the end outro were too, guess correctly?
I love that he doesn't cuss..and is still a badass
The rap God left Eminem and entered nf
A god among men...
You my favorite rapper because you stand up for Jesus & you never conform to the world! Oh and your flow is ridiculously good! Keep standing up for whats right even if you remain an outcast!
Come to Indiana this is amazing ❤️❤️❤️
if he is tired of the eminem comparisons he should stop looking, sounding, and moving just like him
you know he had to do it to em
NF has released new awsome track AS USUAL
NF dosent sound like Eminem that's like saying ice cube sounds like snoop dog lol
this song is fire  ! i broke the link xD
Reminds me of Eminem so much
Honestly... I heard his voice and immediately thought Slim Shady but nah, it's better 💎🔥
I must say that I mever liked that type of music, but NF has something that makes me listen him again and again, maybe the reality he shows through his music.
This guy reminds me of Eminem
Came by this through chance while letting the clips play randomly and I honestly thought I was listening to Eminem for a bit..
Easily the best rapper in the game
Hey just wanted to say that you inspire me. My cousin to. So thank you Nate. Ive never fit in in my life and it just feels good to one is willing to say it. Thank you
Nf the new eminem
just occurred to me he had on joker paint for the scene of getting sick of people telling me to smile more xD
Who else found out about NF  from Roman at woods vlog?
i thought it was eminem for a sec when i saw the ad. awesome
@NF is it just me or r u mad at roman or something?
I just listened to his old songs and he had a wayyyy different style (autotuned singing full of Christian lyrics). Wow he's really found his sound and has come a long way! Great artist!
This is my new theme song
made an instrumental of this song. check it out bro :D
Have you heard of 80 DEKA?\nsoundcloud.com/paradox2025
He low key sound like Eminem
I had seen a snippet of this in an ad on a video talking about Eminem releasing a new album.... I thought this was one of the songs. But at least I'm a fan of this guy now.
Why is this not on the trending page in Australia? #RealMusic
Smile more comment is funny.
He remember me LOGIC, EMINEM AND HOPSIN all the same time....
Every song is a master piece!
He's gonna be this generations Eminem. I can here it now and Em's walking out soon anyway.
Ill just be the OUTCAST
NF's music is great but what really makes me love him so much is that his music isn't all about girls and money and bling. It's actually about his feelings and it tells a story. Thats what music should be about
*who is that man ??* *its the new  emienem* 💙💙💙
U DON'T LIKE THAT THAT'S COOL THATS GREAT THAT'S FINE OKAY U CAN LEAVE NOW!!!!
This guy is a lyrical GOD

What’s that place called you all went to?❤️
What’s ni YouTube channel name
If you don't mind me asking, where was Harlow while you were at Scream park? X
...soooo wouldn't it be a 15 pound lemon tree??
Finally an ACTUAL reason to be a proud Belgian! Giant pumpkins all the way!
Update: the belgium pumpkin grower won again this year (2,222 pounds) but didn't beat his own record from last year!
I'm sorry I'm gonna need an entire video on pumpkin canoes cause WHAT
Humans... WOW! has to be the best ending to a Vlogbrothers video :) I feel the way about humans all the time, and this is no exception.
Does anyone need a ticket to their Charlotte show tonight? I can’t go- selling the ticket for $20!
Omg I feel like I'm watching zack and Cody grown up
In a few more years, people will be the largest fruit.
This made me so happy hahaha thanks Hank xD
This video makes me happy.
mouth poem school sure ban image shut really.
Did anybody notice that their all white
Its 11:11pm, I'm drunk and choose to watch this awesome(and weird) video. You guys are awesome
I grew a giant marrow this year that's too big for my mum to lift
<3 this video is so sweet
Are these fruits and vegetables tested for steroids?
Thank you Hank for sharing this video I'm a little anxious and depressed too so that really helped me I love how you help love  and support your brother you are so amazing
Our festival winner was 768 pounds. Big, but no 2600 pounds. :D
So a guy just won the world record for largest gourd, 4 days after video published.
You guys should make a video for us newbies to the fandom. Like Vlogbrothers 101 with all the references you guys make. A simple resource for all our nerdy confusion.
It's the 10th, anyone got any word on the pumpkin weigh off?
I preordered turtles all the way diwn expecting it to come on the 10 as in the release date but there was mail today even though its columbus day and i got the book!!!
OH MAN! I just went to a giant pumpkin festival and both of my uncles grow giant pumpkins (one of them came in 10th)\nOn this note, the largest watermelon in Oregon ever was awarded first place at said festival.
0/10 no pic of Corbyn and a giant Marrow.
so i just got my copy of turtles all the way down, except, no i didn't, turns out i ended up with 2 copies, and not only that, but they're both signed! i don't know how this error happened but it resulted in the overdraft of my account by 7 dollars, but I'm okay with that because they didn't charge me an overdraft fee and i just sent in my jar full of loose change to them so they wouldn't have to. So all in all, i might end up selling one of my extras to someone who didn't, or i might give it to my sister. i don't know.
This is why I love watching you guys. I love seeing passionate people get passionate about stuff, especially when they are getting passionate about other passionate people's passions! It is infectious and I always find myself feeling excited for the same thing too, even if four minutes prior I knew nothing about it. \n\nThanks for being awesome.
Hi John, Im Brazilian but I live in Bolivia, Im doing a literary analysis of your book Under the same star , I really like your videos, I love your book. Kisses from Peniel school.
Hank green you are the best brother ever
OMG!!!!! The book came today and i am soooo happy!!!!!!!!
This was perfect to start a stressful week. Thank you Hank. 😂😂
This made my week
Wow, this is one of the sweetest videos that I have ever seen.
I thought this was gonna be an autobiography
Hank, you have succeed. I was in a very bad mood and now I'm excited about this pumpkin madness!
Can I post a picture showing my huge vegetable?
Most of them look like deformed mutants lol
That’s some crazy stuff !! 🤔🤔🤔
Says fruits but in thumbnail puts a cucumber/gourd
I FINALLY FOUND YOU MY MAN! I misses sewing you in Crash course. You are awesome there and here :D
My boyfriend and I just broke up and this is the video I didn't know I needed to cheer me up, thank you Hank 😊
Anyone find out the winners?
OMG, @vlogbrothers, you are awesome! @Hank I loved it all -  the subtext, the distraction, can't even imagine how you would have researched! This is true love,<3. - Love, J
These guys are the biggest fruits I've ever seen.
How does one breed a plant?
2:52 IT'S THE GREAT PUMPKIN CHARLIE BROWN
Going with humans messing with fruits and veggies I HAVE HAD COTTON CANDY GRAPES. They were terrifyingly good.
This was coincidentally perfectly timed to relieve a lot of my stress as well, so THANKS HANK. i might have to bring a lil pumpkin to tour now.
My brother grew pumpkins up the side and on top of our shed. In order to get them to stay on the vine, he made pantyhose pouches which he tied to a makeshift trellis so they could sit and grow comfortably while defying gravity. It was very peculiar looking, but the pumpkins made really good pies later.
I don't know if it's still on the air, but Food Network used to have a show during Halloween that involved carving humongous pumpkins.
http://www.bigpumpkins.com/WeighoffResultsGPC.aspx?c=P&y=2017   -- Mathias's pumpkin was over 2,228lb this year! :P Didn't beat out last year's!
I wonder what the largest (in terms of size, not pages) book is...
oh god! that's not a carrot, it's a Resident Evil boss!
New tomato record set by Dan Sutherland
I love both you guys so much! 😂
I already knew you two were the world's biggest fruits
Please tell me I'm not the only one who Googled the European Pumpkin Championship and found out that the fella who holds the record for largest pumpkin ever is currently winning this year's contest with a 2228.9 lb pumpkin. Congrats, Mathias! Keep 'em comin'!
Well if they are alive, I would guess, Pewie Landsherson, Oliver Pratt and formerly Chris Platt though sometimes its Kathy Baits butt on the hole its got to be Boseanne Rarr. Or it could be that sumo wrestler that Quentin Tarateeneeew-Yuk hangs with. Sorry I didn't realize this about giant edible fruits. Nevermind.
i luv how u give us details and info about the giant fruits thank u
Ah!!! I'm so excited! I preordered Turtles and didn't even know when it was being released!  Woot! New Book!!!
Why is this trending again
I decided to take a break from essay writing to catch up on my Vlogbrothers and I just wanted to say thank you. This was amazing. I can go back to my essay proofreading happily now.
This is definitely one of my favorite vlog brother vids. Thanks Hank!
But do they taste good???? 🤔
Wait I thought they were all working for VICE as reporters?
literally thousands of generations of people\n\nIf one generation is taken as 20 years of births and thousands is taken as the lowest possible plural - 2000, then you are saying literally 40,000 years of work and intelligence. How can it be literally 40,000 years when it is fact that the Earth is 6000 years old.
I love big pumpkins. And this video made my day. Thanks Hank.
I almost skipped this video and I'm so glad I didn't
great video, a hug from cuba omg
You should end every video like that. Humans. WOW.
Is it me or did all these vegetables/fruits look like tumours?
I need a photo of John with a copy of Turtles All the way Down in his mouth. You put the thing that does the killing between your teeth...
Genetic selection  at it's best. What better way to genetically modify the species then to selectively breed it.
why is john sad?
Hank needs to watch Wallace and Gromit and the Curse of the Were Rabbit asap
I am from Belgium and it is true. Some regions take the pumkin thing very serieusly and in elementery school we did competitions of our own.
Why is pewdiepie not on the list
I love this video
Thank you for a lovely video that warmed me up on a grey, cold Sunday. \nI just wanted to add that when I'm upset and need a little bit of anarchic giggling I go on Scottish Twitter. Completely loopy, foul mouthed, sometimes way too much but always strangely logical, Scottish Twitter is the Wild Wild West of the Internet.
Stop talking and just show us the damn fruit
World’s largest fruit; Bruce Jenner.
I have good news and bad news \nBad news Some preorders shipped early \nGood News The preorder when to me who will not spoil the AMAZING first 3 chapters
1:30 am i the only one thinking of the curse of the were rabbit
I'd devour that watermelon. :) Can't have enough of it. :)
This makes me uncomfortable.
Giant potatoes look frickin gross...
Hahahahaha Hank you are the sweetest!
<3 Hankie.
u forgot Mr Bean :/
Good morning John
nice click bait on trending keep it up youtube!!!
Hey, my name is Mathias.
onions and potatos aren't fruits
SEEING YALL ON TOUR IN NYC TOMORROW
I hate your videos.
**Super Mario Sunshine Flashbacks**
Those are pumpkin kayaks.
No Gmo
LOVE.
Pumpkins and Penguins, Hank
This is what happens when you genetically modify food...
Hope Scotland qualify from an Englishman
Holland guy here. We miss that passion and willing to win!
Why is Scotland in pink? I've never seen that before. Also I'm very impressed with that Coldplay singer - didn't know he could play like that! ;p
Scotland!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Never seen a black Scottish before. Very cool 🙏🏿
strange how it was only weiss that got booed for slovakia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKfpauB-5l0&t=42s
Scotland played good, andtgey won my bet good job! Got to qualify
Englishman here. But honestly Scotland look far better and way more exciting to watch then England. Was only the keeper stopping Scotland being about 4-0
10vs12 Could be different match when Mak rather could scored and did not made fault. Anyway, pretty hard group even Slovakia may be will not proceed. Slovakia, Slovenia, Scotland should be on the cup :D
oh wow this was a very lucky one ... :/ :D
Robert mak stuped this is not greek league
I've half Slovakian so idk what to say here :/
scotlands central defence represented by hearts and Blackburn omg thank god we,re not going to the world cup the goal difference would read for nil conced 35 after the group games
England and Slovakia will make it to the World Cup from group C.Scotland will struggle at Slovenia and Slovakia will definately beat Malta
Tht late goal made it the 40\nMin wait to get out   Asda car park worth it haha
Wish Scotland would stop playing in those poofy pink shirts. Hardly a tough image.
Good luck to Scotland as an england fan
We have some of the most passionate fans in football. Just please don't bottle it in Slovenia
COME ON YOU BOYS IN PINK!!!!!!! #SCOTLANDSPINKARMY
Good decision by a reff!!
outside the box thats a free kick,if its a foul its a foul, his point is right, thats a free kick so why no pen
Proud to be scottish 🔵⚪💪now on to Slovenia #believe
From an Englishman one more games lad's you can do it!!!!!!! See you in Russia.
Not a fan of that pink kit. They should use black and / or yellow.
I'm just here to see the Scottish Fans freaking out completely. Hope to see you at WC18.\nBest wishes from Germany.
Who else was there?
Got to love Scotland! Defo be supporting them over England if they make it... coming from an Englishman (with Scottish family ties)
My friends went to see it! In wembley
That boy from coldplay sure can shoot!
Scotland playing amazing keep it up boys.
It would be really cool if wales,england and scotland all qualify for the wc
Kieran defenitely deserved that pen...\n
Really Good Match To Watch..
What a game. Should have watched this one
Such a great match and better than a grand football final 😱😱
Man off the match is the fans xd
Wish England had this passion.
As Gordon Strachan said, \n\nTheir goalkeeper played brilliant, as did the crossbar.
So many nice shots, but eventually get such a weird goal,
Excellent keep up the good work!
Hi guys can everyone check out my little boys football channel if you like subscribe thank you
Scotland will go in playoff because our retarded coach fafanec will lose on purpose. Fortunately he will be gone after this match and hopefully never seen again. At least it's a safe bet who bets on football.
Well done once again for fighting hard scottish boys just hope we now can get a win over in Slovenia be tough game but canny fault the effort from the scotland team
whatever happens,so proud of my country tonight,Benidorm erupted when the goal went in,nice end to a holiday!
Subscribe to me and stay active 👍comment done 😅 I WILL RETURN AND STAY ACTIVE 😃
if scoltand qualify to the world cup, they will be in brazil group, thats always happens.
What's with the faggy pink shirts?
Unlucky, own goal at the end
I was tearing my hair out with 10 minutes to go ,the amount of times I have seen that with Scotland needing the win and coming so close chance after chance but the ball wouldn't go in the net at the 84 minute mark I just decided Scotland are cursed that's it end of ! And then that goal goes in Jesus Christ hahaha you stress me out Scotland but I love you surley we can do it now !!
Shiteland third place
Hahahahaha. Still laughing to myself
Maddd
Cmon SCOTLAND 👍🏻
good job scotland
Great Dúbravka. Amazing....
Not Fair for goalkeeper..
Goal at 5:25
Celtic v dudee 💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚6-1 celtic
What a goalkeeper💗
Chrissy martin 😊\nYou rams !!
We will def beat Slovinia 0-2 mooooonnn boys
why pink... why... FORZA SCOTLAND!!!!!!
So.... Congratulation from Slovakia.
Scotland deserved it
Well done mini terriers
https://youtu.be/Zo8I_gC6sSM
On ye go boys!
FIFA Keeper
Cmon Scotland!
Strong play
Yaaaaaaaaas!
I hate yet rate Skrtel.  Very tough streetwise player.
Please please please win today boys.
That goalkeeper is world class
Best fans in the world so much passion from Scotland the English have nothing like this so sad !!😎😛
Imagine booing a Slovakia player because he used to play for rangers pathetic
Every1 criticising the guy who dived, fair enough but the Slovakian goalie played insane.
You have to play Slovenia in Slovenia and win because Slovakia will beat Malta. That will be very difficult Slovenia are a solid team. Even if you win there is a good likelihood you'll be lowest second best team and not qualify for the playoffs. In any case whatever happens credit to Strachan for turning a terrible team into contenders.
Why didn't they play like this in the second half against Slovenia? That game was a disgrace, and Strachan's absurd comment about lack of genetics was what got him the sack. They had everything going for them apart from the away venue, and should have won. So disappointing, and typical Scotland I'm sorry to say. The fighting spirit was sorely lacking in that second half against Slovenia and we paid the price.
Consider a fact: a Serbian guy send off Slovakian player in both match against England and against Scotland. We must play in ten to lose tightly.
Scotland did not score a goal in doubles from Slovak
Can we do it!? Should never have let England off the hook.
This should be on Scots telly.
I'm a Rangers fan(also Scotland fan obvs) but griffiths has a wand of a foot, his free kicks are insane. When he banged those 2 against Joe Hart me and my cousin went ballistic, but sadly in typical Scottish style we bottled it and only came out with a point 😂
check out my youtube channel i made a diss track on rice gum!
I'm English but support Scotland and Wales more - their team's passion is real
here a slovakian...good match guys, but its still not the end...
Slovakia beast win with malta and rusia is open but scotlan dont win with slovenia
Why are Scotland playing in pink?
Wrong Title..there are never any highlights when Scotland or England attempt to play football
Today Scotland will pay Slovenia cause they know that Slovakia will win so they are out of play and they will let Scotland win...sadly
Frrrreeeeeeeddddddoooooom i can say it because im Scottish
Wow, Scotland actually got a chance to go to the World Cup, what a time to be alive...
Who is the child that keeps whistling?\nNeeds a dunt with an elbow.
Scotland no foot ball
SUPER👍👍👍
Anyone know why Scotland are playing in pink, not their dark blue ?
That commentator is atrocious.
no tartan army in moscow :). If you meet Italy good luck to your boys they will sliced you into pieces

Was inspired by this trailer to make this. Thought you guys might enjoy it. \n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/luke_pilkington/more-human-than-human
I'm so ready
I'm so pumped it's late we should probably go to sleep
Is that Junie in the thumbnail
All good things come to a end... except this fucking show CAN I GET A HYPE IN THE CHAT
i'm just.. Wow
You absolute dumbasses.. why is that the thumbnail?
I CAN'T I'M TOO EXCITED
Anybody has the music? I know it's Last Ray Of Light but the one used in this trailer is cooler than the original.
The best trailer of this year
I'm so close to reaching 50 subscribers!⚽️⚽️⚽️Please sub to me.
When I saw 'October' and '27' my heart skipped a thousand beats per second
Hey what's Lucille doing here
Jesus Christ I need a time machine..
Tornadoes! The Thesselhydra’s legs kinda look tornado like. Could be... Would tie in well as a natural and believable (but oddly supernatural) looking phenomena for Hawkins residents... The spinning liquid in tubes, the spinning upside down world ash/spores around Will... Just a theory.
I just finished watching season 1 and I can't wait for thissss!
Imm say it, since no one else does.... Stranger Things is waaaaay too overrated. S1 was alright. Thats it. Nothng more, nothing less
I SAW THIS ALREADY IN 1984!
GREAT . I LOVE IT
i hope they don’t fuck it up, season 1 was a blast i hope season 2 is better
this trailer is so much better wowowowoow
Where the fuck is Barbara!!!
Who else can only see Juni Cortez in the thumbnail
Wow this show looks like shit
I have watched this trailer so many times and it only came out Like 2 days ago! Honestly so excited for season 2!
I think it would be cool if season 3 took place during Christmas time.
2:07 Richie Tozier is that you?
Who doesnt like free things? I have been playing this game verydice from the app store, and have ordered 5 things for Christmas so far. I've only been playing a month! All you do is roll dice and collect tickets. Everything ships free from amazon and does not even require cc info. There are diapers, tools, toys, electronics, car seats, novelty, adult, and food plus much more.. Pretty much anything from Amazon. If you use my code 441290 you will start with 50 rolls and I will get 30. This is definitely helping me with Christmas so I thought I'd share to help someone else out :) if you have any questions message me and I will give you some tips and hints to getting the most tickets possible..
My body is ready
I hope you will like it https://youtu.be/VAi5ImiP6d0
@ 0.53 What is the name of background score where can i find it
Yup...goosebumps.\nI hope Netflix servers are up to the task....

So is season 2 related to season 1 or is it just same kids different universe type deal?
OMG WTF is ready?!?!!?
gonna watch this series this time
This looks...awesome!!!\nA few thoughts....looks like there'll be a few teams: Hopper, Joyce, Will, and possibly Mike, Jonathan and Nancy, and Steve, Dustin, Lucas, and Max. All pretty intriguing, and they'll probably all team up for that final awesome scene, if it is a final scene. Plus, of course, Billy will be causing some trouble and Eleven will make her appearance, though somehow I don't think she'll be such a big factor this season. It looks like she'll be this season's Will; not with everyone else, but on her own.
How does this have 3k dislikes...?
#1 on trending yes lads
I CAN'T WAIT HOLY SHIT
AGGHHHHH
GOOSEBUMPS!!!!
Gonna have to rewatch the 1st season since it's been a year, need to remember those little details before the new season starts
AHHHH I NEED THIS IN MY LIFE
My brain couldn’t process all this...
This guy can be bias for The whole Europe lol
The reason you aren't going to clubs and slapping them is because your shite
Haha just keeps getting better every time I listen to this Muppet.. started to hate arsenal football club. And it's down to this man. So when I see you boys lose its actually great. In fact I enjoy it more that Liverpool losing and that's strong words coming from a Manchester lad \n\nLast season when he said were going finish above united hahaha! \nWhen clearly that's the only positive he could take away. When he can see spurs 2nd. Not laughing now tho..  \nWell look at you now!!  Where is the positive coming this season. Finishing above newly promoted Newcastle? because thats gonna look like a struggle.\nYou are the laughing stock of the premier league and the whole world of football is seeing it.. Keep it ups gunners!! We are loving it!
Lmao DT went missing when robbie got pressured by the goons after the game why is he acting bad now
ozils eyes were too big thats why he missed the goal he was aiming at the crowd
Ozils world class status is officially gone.
Offside as your belly.😂😂😂 rahhh Robbie killed a man. Watford call for man down.
Had that been Iwobi or Walcott DTs attitude would be a whole lot different but okay...
You didnt beat us 6-0 coz u r not even in the same galaxy as Man City.
Until things change then the future will be more and more disasters arsenal useless and will never win league or even come close to the league under current regime ozils finishing poor and now it cost us a game that in amongst rest of wengers tactical problems get the whole pack of bastards out
I FGUCVKING HATE MR DT IF I EVER SEE HIM IN PUBLIC IL SMASH HIM IN THE MOUTH
Arsenal Wenger, Sanchez and Ozil contract talks has dominated the club. They all need to go..
This is the real problem, he got a good mouth for this! I backed Wenger since 2002 when I was 15 but it's high time. He is 68 now and we know what's happening at overall football, he has to go and needed a CHANGE; system and the board!
Maybe he was cold 😂😂😂😂😂
Dt just said ozil might have missed because hes cold? What if ty said that..
hahhaha never offside u twit. also we played liverpool got 3 against them. u lot do talk a load of pish. los never heard  aperson shout so loud im from luton. nowt to be proud of.
When cleverley scored that goal, i think everyone celebrated so we could get these reactions 😂
Support Luton Town thats your team really
DT is always right? Team Selection was wrong today. Will can't Lazacazette finish 90 minutes, Giroud came on, but he touched the ball less than 5 times, Why did Welbeck start anyway? He is coming back from injury.
I can’t wait for the day when dt like fights somebody 😂🤣
He might have been cold? DT next Ty
i agree pep is making pl la liga.m 6 nill 7 nill we saw this in la liga
Arsene and arsenal are the funniest thing in the premiership... Lol.  Look at them get carried away over celebrating that lead, perma hubris via Wenger.
For being a super fan for lack of better word for him (mr DT) he is really down to earth in his analysis about the games. The other ppl Robbie has on is just frustrated and angry, DT sees the bigger picture and can argue his points better. And there is a fundametaly flaw with the club at this point and it has been like that for years. The mentality of the club needs to be much much more competitiv players are to comfortable in the club yes we do have some great players but we dont play them right, we need a massiv shift in the clud to take us back up, we didnt even play this shit when we didnt have any money in the club.
Worzil messed up bigtime.\n DT admitting gooners are a top 6 side wtf how embarrasing not top three or top getting used to europa league are you DT.
Dt is a savage
REAL TALK START FROM 4:57
Extremely sharp description on the major facts affecting us!
How can  twat from luton  cry when they are outclassed, ARSENAL ARE LIVING IN THE PAST, get real mate
😂😂😂 RED STAR BELGRADE WILL BEAT YOU ASWELL!!!!! 🇷🇸
Dt the realest of em all
Ooooooooh watch out, DT's from Luton careful guys.\nWenger is finished now, He heard DT's from Luton he's now resigning.
Arsenal don't have great players so they don't win as many games.\nSimple as that
I think someone love e.t
Deeney was offside? He didn't even touch the ball. Cleverley clearly shot on target
Blackest white guy i've ever seen this guy is a gimmick.
THIS CLUB (ARSENAL) IS A JOKE, A BIG JOKE: \nTHE BIGGEST FOOLS OF ALL IS WE THE ARSENAL FANS, WE KEPT SAYING WENGER OUT FOR SO MANY COUNTLESS YEARS NOW AND ARSENE AND THE BOARD-DIRECTORS ARE STILL CONTINUOUSLY PLAYING POLITICS ON OUR HEAD WHILE THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY...WE THE FANS SHOULD JOIN HEAD TOGETHER AND SAY TO OURSELVES NOT TO GO TO THE STADIUM FOR A STRAIGHT 4 MATCHES BOTH HOME AND AWAY UNTIL WENGER-OUT, THEN WHEN THEY SEE THE WHOLE STADIUM IS EMPTY THEN A DECISION WOULD PROBABLY BE MADE TO FAVOUR OUR PROTESTS/PLIGHTS.
Even a half of jack wilshere is better than both xhaka and elneny. They dont know wen to pass wen to shoot wen to tackle. They cant even dribble or get forward in attack
People are making whole careers out of Wenger being shite
Shut ur mouth Robbie u don't have to talk about ozil he is the world class
😂😂😂😂 i love arsenal fan tv
It's painful to see  this manager destroying the club and it's shame to watch Elneny playing 90 minutes a head of Jack.....# I'm sorry for Jack  he must leave the  club and get himself fit for England squad 2018 world cup.
Arsenal TV is for interesting when arsenal lose, about time,it was getting a bit boring
we need to change this formation it really frustates our game..We don't have the players with quality to play in this formation. We need to adopt more attacking formation
Robbie got helicopter'd out after DT provoked the Watty fans. Some say Robbie's jet is at Pratt & Whitney getting serviced for the Serbia flight.
He's actually telling the truth!!
DT ..the voice of all frustrated gooners 👌\nHorrendus team selection - Awful refereeing - the Ozil miss - the shit medical staff that cleared Welbeck and Laurent to play\nall of those were reasons for the defeat
wow...its good to see dt daring dose watford fans...wow..challenging dem on dere home..awsum
DT from Luton? He must hate moslems since they've taken over Luton.
My theory is that Robbie and arsene wenger are secretly in partnership together to try and build the biggest YouTube channel ever.
Ozil should leave, he deserves better. A world cup winner and big star at RM now he is just being constantly bashed by the english pundits and fans. How can you expect you player to play with heart when you are constantly targeted by the fans and is always the scapegoat for poor team performance? The man who has failed over a decade is the real problem, give Wenger messi and he will still struggle to win the league because of his stubborn and outdated philosophy.
I thought I was mad at Jose..... lol
I told you this before, didnt I say it already, everyone was laughing at me when I said it'\n\nThis DT  guy is more concerned with being right than anything else.
I think Arsenal should appoint this tattooed guy as their manager. He seems like he knows so much.\nDT for Arsenal Manager role
It's not just Watford fans laughing at you mate.
Robbie clearly hates Ozil.. this mad man only cares about his channels publicity
Arsenal have problem with their players, not the manager
Your belly is offside. Proper street comment. Credit to DT
I want cum in his ass so bad
Kids in Syria have more hope than Arsenal.
ozil is trash the modern game is all about pacey skillful wingers get someone like carrasco or something
Ozil scores arsenal go 2-0 up ..Instead that bastard misses & then it's 1-1 & then they fall apart ...
Why does AFTV need to name the video DT rant? If you love your club, stop click baiting rival fans in to mock at your situation. Pathetic.
This team was so dull today......no hope of winning....our only goal from Per on a corner.......
Are you stupid? We didn’t give a decent chance away until ozil came on. Look at the the game again. The team was solid, the way we need it to be. Then ozil comes on at 1-0 and we lose 2-1. No coincidence.
I died when I heard, we’re a top 6 side!
Here we go again
Are you guys deluded stop blaming people and shit the team was unlucky not to score
Bit of Arsenal fan TV after work 👍
Robbie you’re too bad on ozil you should give him respect
Troy Deeney said it best on FinalWhistle   Arsenal has no cajones, no nuts . He's right can't argue that, he said all you have to do is challenge them and they won't respond. I'm true Arsenal, but this shit is pathetic, I'm sick of them playing soft and not advance attacking. Iwobi and Mesut should've buried their chances instead they don't have that clinical mindset. Even Deeney said the look in their eye and body language was like no big deal we'all give it another go. FFS
Yes DT, so much honesty and sense spoken
Ozil missed his chance because he was a bit cold? 😂😂
Number 2 on trending everyone loves a good arsenal rant
Lol City won the same fixture 6-0!!! Wenger in please!!!
Look at Robbie his but a big bet on Watford when 1-0 up
Gotta give props to DT, he has balls, I'm a Liverpool fan but I appreciate the passion you guys have for your club. I hope Arsenal get back to where they belong and I am sure they will .
#2 on trending
2nd on trending 😂
Lacazette, the new Lucas Perez
DT armchair manager😂 knows it all. Hes well 'ard
New Saison same shit! Every year!
Shit talker
Robbie jheez let him finish
Oh man😂
Dt a Savage
Ngl DT is basically a pundit
BOYCOT
DT for manager
Draxler, Rabiot, Lemar, Isco And. CB Are needed.. urgentlyy
Suprised they aint blaming alexis
Man u fan here haha
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wenger the best...😂
#wengerinforever
DT next manager
He's from Luton ? Support your local team you mug
Sorry but cant other clubs win against arsenal. This is getting stupid. complain, complain, complain. Its fair game for arsenal and fair game for watford. Watford deserved it 100%
DT the only one that got sense in AFTV.
If Ty suggested Ozil missed because he was cold, DT would choke slam him into next Thursday.

Everyone has demons.
A mutant has no name
Is this the x men 2
Sooo....the next X-men movie is a horror film? I am confusion 😀
looks like a generic horror movie but with xmen, ill still watch it tho
I don't understand the hype. Sure, the concept of a superhero horror movie is cool and the visuals are nice, but jump scares aren't scary.
Those mutants are probably the kids from 'Logan'
why is this horror?
So it's still with xmen universe?
The New Mutants trailer looks well more like a horror flick rather than a Marvel movie? I don't know if it's good or bad if it's too dark? I was expecting more like the Logan movie kind of dark
Seriously I thought the pic/still in my notifications was Leanne Rimes
no warlock. end of line
I thought this was for X-Men or anything Marvel related
So doesn’t Deadpool appear in the New Mutants type of stuff?
I see Charlie Heaton. I’m in
Hard pass. Poor casting, all of the actors are waaay too old, and look nothing like their characters. NM needs a proper origin with Xavier and Moira McTagget (sp). Very disappointed.
For the people wondering yes this is in the X-Men universe and the blonde girl is Colossus sister Magik.
Hey, I am doing a survey regarding whether we should have a speech and debate class accessible for high school students. I would really appreciate it if you take some time out of your busy schedule and do my survey. \nhttps://goo.gl/forms/IkLHOXUxzOiFnkMG3
I though this was superhero stuff not a horror movie
I thought the mutant part was like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles..
well this is gonna be different. i am 100000% here for a horror xmen movie tho - you done got my attention fox (not that you ever lost it i love the xmen too much)
thought the female talkin was the woman from Inception but twas instead the woman from Elysium. perhaps my hearing is goin bad, either way put those two in a thriller.
I reacted to this watch on my channel
What fight am i waiting for?\n\nJean Grey & Wolfbane VS Maximus the Mad
Rip Logan and still waiting on teen or preferably young adult X-2 to get her solo movie.
Was not what I was expecting when I clicked on the trailer...
since when does marvel make horror movies?
I hope this isnt the Logan sequel or somethin
So the girl from Split now has DID and gets superpowers too?
Hmmm marvel creating a horror movie, interesting
Wait is this supposed to be good?
Just like Kamen rider, they went from this\nhttps://youtu.be/FuVCq-dSQnw\nTo this\nhttps://youtu.be/a7TnbrQHML0
this looks more like a horror movie than a super hero movie this will be marvel darkest movie yet
That moment when you realize..... the director of this movie did The Fault in Our Stars
LOL I thought it was an honest trailers at first LOL
Dad has flown...across the ocean
I don't know if I can ever be okay when there's no Xavier and Wolverine in a mutant movie,if this one can't pull it off,it'll be really really sad.
A girl has no name because a girl isn't just a girl.....she is a mutant.
This is not really what I expected. Though, let’s wait to see more in next trailers. I want to see bits of their power, Wolfsbane, Sunspot, Magik, Native American girl. Anyway I hope it’ll be cool.
I'm going to need Fox, Sony, Universal, and WB to give ALL rights back to Marvel. Thank you.-  A Concerned Marvelite.
Who else had NO IDEA what this movie was about and IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT CANDA BOARDER, LAURA, NEW MUTANT TEAM!😂😂
The first movie to do that face wall thing was Nightmare on Elm Street.
Are these the new Elm St. children?  Looks awful.
Man I be glad when Marvel buys back this sorry franchise and make it great again :)
I just hope there's different settings 👀 I would hate for the movie to take place in one...place😐 especially since all of those mutants have different backgrounds and orgins. Don't put so much emphasis on the horror concept of this film. Feed us a an emotional story line that goes far beyond jump scares and bloodshed
This looks so bad. So much potential and then you go and make it into a shitty blumhouse looking movie.
This version of the song is much better than the original one.
And people complained about BvS is too dark...
I applaud the director and his team for putting something new and exciting to comic book movies. I will see it for being creative
Get a life, Hollywood & it's old mutant stories
I take it that this isn't a surprise X-men movie...
For those saying that this looks generic, I assure you that you have never seen anything like this before...
its like a horror x men I like
Isn't Maisie in this?
So it's about Mirage's powers going out of control?
Well that's extremely interesting.
Nigga I thought this was X-Men
This looks awful only because the tone doesn't seem to be Marvel and more suspense horror.  Don't brand it as marvel if it doesn't seem related! News flash, no rebranding was needed!! The only thing that interested me was Arya Stark! Love Massie.
Okay Marvel I see doing your horror shit😏
is it an horror movie?
Good on them that they are trying something different. Which is a lot more that can be said for most of movies these days. I am really enjoying Legion, The Gifted is a solid show and  off to a good start. So I will definitely watch this.
Doesnt really look like a horror movie. Looks more like a thriller, with a few jumpscares. Kind of like spiderwick.
While I like that this doesn't look like every other superhero film, I don't like that it looks like every other horror movie. I severely hope it isn't just a cliched film full of jump scares and that there's actually something of substance here. I'd be a waste if something trying to be different turned into a generic film in an entirely different way.
.....Marvel is making a creepy movie that's a sequel to The abandoned 2015
Check how well your friends know you ---\nwww.qzingo.com
I'll save my money and wait till red box :)\nWhy pay $20.00 when i can pay $1.00\n\n\n\nAnd for the idiots who can't add, its 5 for the ticket, 5 for popcorn, 5 for the drink, 5 for the date, and if you don't pay for any of that, than your a lonely strange little man, and you have my pity, Farewell! *Dose buzz lighter farwell sign* V(O.O)
This is a Marvel movie?
Looks Awesome!!!!!
Looks pretty dumb.

American Horror Story: Mutants
Klasse Video. Wie findet ihr unser neues Video? Grüße von Familie Lucky 👍
Just remember... Howard the Duck is in this universe.
Dear Fox, give the movie rights of the X-Men back to marvel.

bu9e410C__I,

bu9e410C__I,Signed, everyone.
Hmmmmm this trailer was pretty thrilling
I'm sorry but when I go to see a superhero movie I like action, adventure, humor, and people with super powers saving the day. If I want to go see a horror movie I'll go see jigsaw or Annabelle. My opinion is if your gonna point your film in the horror direction then go full horror; blood, guts, and some other  REALLY scary s&@$ that makes you wanna s@#% your pants, otherwise your film just looks boring.
Mutants VS Demons
That music doesnt fit this ad at all
I don't mind over-saturation of Marvel movies but there are waaayyy too many X-Men projects. based on how bad X-Men Apocalypse was I'm surprised they jumped right into Dark Phoenix. opening night my theater was laughing at how dumb Apocalypse was. X-Men has great characters but I'd rather see 1 good movie than like 2 bad movies and a tv show
0:25 song name please...
I Like How Marvel Is Trying To Try Something Not In Their Typical Realm
WHEN CHARLIE SHOWED UP I GOT A MILLON CHILLS
when this is his way to hide the fact he takes steroids, drug test he's positive for steroids he's gonna say that he had to for his knee ahahahahahahahahahahah
Do me a Fabre a d drink bleach
U think that our the shit, but during the fight, if ur little legitimate buddies wouldn't have been at the fight, KSI would've made that gap in ur  teeth even bigger \n
That weren't actually Conor was it?
Weller trying to back out of the deal... surprise!
Green and grey x
Your a pussy man up fight me not ksi you cunt
i see pink and white!
And my YouTube channel is called Rusterballpit
It’s to get him out the fight
HE'S A PUSSSSSYYYYY
I see them as stop and this trend
You have a fake ass call with McGregor and still makes a mockery of it. If it was real then there's no class for you. Yeah He boxed MayWeather but it wasn't his sport and lost it. Making excuses all the time dude. Plus, the reason why KSI wanted to some of rest of the money is for charity and people in need for needs and such. We really don't care about your book because all it is. Is some fictional non'scary shit that it means something to you that people won't care about it. Awesome how you manipulate everyone on your fan base to seem you're going to win because We all know r i know is that you take steroids and drugs to make it seem your stronger in overnight. It doesn't come like that and taking a piss that you think Anti-depressants is taking a piss of depression. It's a drug as well and that's what JJ or  (KSI) said. He didn't make it clearer because he wants to tease you or chop your balls in saying. Highly recommend you to exercise like JJ (KSI) more and prepare for this because if you think you have the body and shit like that. You be beaten by him by the muscle mass of what he has compared to yours. I would be offended if he took a piss of depression but he was taking a piss over the anti-depressant drugs. Low self centered prick. No wonder he fucked your main chick and got sloppy seconds because your nothing without him and the whole group of the Sidemen as well. Like if you agree how he thinks to control people and manipulate them or you guys to think he's all big and bad, HES ALL TALK
weller will win of course cuz he is stronger then ksi's bragging ass
Yeah the joe beat his ass
My names connor and plus I'm also pretty
Wait this video foreshadowing what going to happen to Joe weller after the fight oh I get it now
well your stupid Weller. people think its pink because they might be colour blind
His mom makes me recognize of the racist women on the train who was insulting a Chinese girl. LOL
When ksi gets knock the fuck out everyone get smart
2:50 that phone call with Conor McGregor is fake
so you already gave up and have a excuse ready
Everyone be saying ‘he’s tryna get out the fight’ shut the fuck up, he clearly stated the fight is on
My Birthday is 1st february so just 2 days i'll see ksi fuck u up😜
That call from mcgregor was so planned,  trying to big himself up. Makes him look dumb
Omfg like fr all these dicky ass KSI fans commenting shit on here like ok then boo, you don't like him? Get the fuck off his videos and go lick JJ's ass ffs. The fight is still on and Joe is confident asf so he won't be backing down or coming up with excuses so DW.

Do you need drugs to stay sane?
I love you joe! ❤️😍 I hope your recovery goes well and I am looking forward to see you smash Ksi to the ground 💖💋 forget the people that are calling u wet and that ur a pussy, ur not okay, believe in ur self and don’t take any notice of what other people are saying xx
HOW THE FUCKK DID HE GET TO TALK WITH CONNOR
So you can go train but not fight. My bullshit sense is tingling
The shoe is in inverted
i love the phone call 😂❤ he got bare haps
to all the cunts who actually give a fuck about this joke of a fight, Walk in to traffic please.
There was no point in telling us this but now u have an excuse to use
I hope it's broken permanently
Joe Weller we all know your just doing this for views
I see pink and white WHERE THE FUCK IS THE TURQUOISE FFS😂😂like genuinely
Weller ,also know as wellard, please send me sexy pictures of your pulsating bellend you full kit wanker😉😋😋
I'm on team ksi but fucking hell I doubt he's using the injury as an excuse, Weller can take a loss I'll give him that.
you're a fucking Joe Weller and your mom is a fucking ogre
So... to push sales of your dead book you are giving away dead (prop) items 😂 god you suck \n\nAnd aww bless your knee has snapped just like your mental capacity 😊🙃
*1:20** like if you had a broken arm and you continued to use it - it would hurt. that's what i have with my knee.*\n*uhmm...why dont just say the same thing but about your knee and not arm...? its the same shit, why bring up arms lol?*\n*mind=blown*
That's defo not Connor.... that's that guy who does the impressions and does Mike Tyson
It's more, like... turquoise and grey.😏
That's Al Foran the impressionist  not Connor McGregor, Joe you fuckin liar.
lets watch all the ksi fanboys saying its an excuse and weller is scared lmao

Luis Suarez scores late for a point! Griezmann to Barca in the summer for 100m € release clause? 🔥🔥
That’s one beautiful stadium
Acaso los ingleses ven mas la liga Española que nosotros solo veo comentarios en inglés
Now that's a bloody entertaining match if I ever saw one! Barça couldn't put a scratch on Atletico's defense in the first half but were all over them in the 2nd half and deserved to win by at least 2 or 3 goals! But a point away at Atletico is still respectable though! I'm just happy to see the old Barça back!
this is the match between two one of the best goalkeepers.
Why does this commentator say grithsman
when i look at barca team squad how the hell that i wonder why there's no neymar...
Velverde did very poor coaching today. Paulinho at 70th minute? Sergio Roberto, Delefou all towards the end? Gomez playing forward? Did he have a brain damage or something today?
Very good point the third or second team in spain
The best match in the league so far this season.
Pique is liability . Every game player embarrass him. He so slow with reaction. Umtiti is monster and future leader of our defense
Wtf is going on in comment section
Valverde made weird subs but for some odd reason, it worked out.
Suarez is a amazing player, for me Barcelona’s best.
how does this channel make money?
Andre Gomes was awesome in this game
hardly saw atleti touch the ball...\nbarca was far better
Wow i didn expect a draw for barca i thought atleti will dominate but barca played really well but oblak had an amazing game
@6:18 God what a vision. Iniesta is love  <3  <3
Griezmann was the best man in the game
If they started without Gomez and with Delofeu and roberto,they would've scored more
Wasnt it a foul at 6:50 ???
subscribe and watch below link \nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/AsherafBeunic
GG atletico, best game of the season so far, very equal game.
barca deserves to win really and that was a penalty ,that foul on messi in the box
Ooh nice game,but was expecting barca win
Saul is world class... best youngster in Europe after mbappe and dembele
Btw i still dont like pique play tonight and gomez.  Barca should sell gomez.  Pique dont sell but just give a warning.
what a game.   saul u beauty
So many chances for barcelona, they should have won.
Atleti can never  win this shit of thoughts.....anything. ..
Oh yeah, eufalona right? Stupid ass Real Madrid fans. Where was the referee now?
i got man of the match thanks to media all you fucks cant do nothing about it suarez is my bitch
dont put replay's scene on your video this is youtube
iniesta we will miss those passes when u leave
Sorry 15.

what did that fake do against atletico   everyone knows fifas bitch is fixed  messi was shit
Juan Oblak You r the Hero of this Match😍
The joke of the night\nThe greatest player the world has ever seen... \n😂😂😂
*TOP*
Fucking valverdi lets Gomez play 90 minutes but paulinho 10
Dembele - Suarez - Griezmann\n                   Messi\nEriksen            -           Busquets
barca plays better without neymar
Hahahha messi cant score against an above average team hahaha
andre gomes is bad luck for barca
*BARCELONA* 👍👍👍\n*MADRID* 👎👎
people the truth is i love barcelona and messi but the last comment was from my brother who loves real madrid.i love barcelona long live barca long live messi
chelsea's power is teal
though Barça drew but they fxcked Athletico...so many chances created by Barça. And what was Griezman doing?  fxck Athletico,  fxck barca 🖕🖕🖕

Anxiety in one video 😬 so many facial products in one day 😂
On a serious note these products have a shit load of chemicals in them and using all the brands and mixtures at the same time is really going to irritate your skin and probably cause you to break out more! These products are so harsh I did so much research and found that natural products are the best to avoid any issues for problem skin
This is bloody hilarious! What a team you guys are.
I love this, more videos from you, please. You make it feel so fun and interesting, it feels like being right there with you guys. 😄
Dina, you're so beautiful! ❤

Troy keeping it real! non of that media training shit.
Spot on Troy. And I'm an arsenal fan
First footballer I've seen talk like a real person👏🏾
I'm an arsenal fan. This man is completely right, well done to Watford, we were shit today
His attitude is better than any single player or staff member at Arsenal.
Turns out Deeney is a savage.
Damn it's refreshing to hear a current footballer talk like this. What a guy. Real talk! Do more of these
I love a footballer who speaks his mind, not enough of these
He's a top bloke, so humble and real
THIS WAS THE REALEST PUNDITRY OF A FOOTBALL GAME I HAVE EVER SEEN ... DEENEY YOU SAVAGE
I hate this but he is 100% correct and I am an Arsenal fan. It's disgusting that our team plays so garbage!
Oh it's true IT'S DAMN TRUE
Great video, could do with a few players with Troy Deeney's grit. He makes the arsenal squad sound like a bunch of pussies. Wenger is the one who has allowed this to happen.
AresenalFanTV is brilliant tonight! 😆
As a defender, and someone that loves a good scrap I would love to play against Troy Deeny. He would give me a right battle and i would love it .
Arsenal fans are happy. Troy doing us a favour. We been saying this for years. Wenger, and players will be watching this.
The match is finished, yet Troy Deeney is still scoring against Arsenal!!
Sorry, but just watched the Wenger press conference & he did not blame the penalty for the loss. He did say he thought it wasn't a penalty, but they lost due to their drop in their level & lack of killer instinct infront of goal. Which is sadly the truth. Well done to Watford tho.
As an arsenal fan I couldn't agree more. We are fucking garbage.
The only reason we lost is because Watford got the unfair penalty
I am an Arsenal fan thank you Troy Deeney that the truth and everybody sees through Wenger now
Watford mans are pussies yeah. You ain't gonna do shit
and he's right, oh how arsenal have fallen #wengerout
I hope Arsenal get relgated!! So that fucking Stan can sell!! I wish we go deep in to 3rd division
Troy definitely has a future in TV punditry
Reality check... some of the highest gate price's in Europe and most expensive matchday tickets and season tickets in the Premier League. Reality check...the worst transfer policy I've ever seen. Reality check...selling club. Reality check...adding £1 to a bid to try and lure a player and outbid someone is hilarious. Reality check...nobody wants to play for Arsenal not even the Arsenal players. Reality check...they offered a pay rise to Ox which was ridiculous considering how shit he is and to add insult to injury he does you a favour and fucks off for a lesser wage. Reality check... injury prone team. Reality check...majority of Arsenal fans argue and fight with each other every match day. Reality check...over a decade without winning the league. Reality check...Xhaka can't pass, tackle, shoot or defend. Reality check...the Arsenal 'stars' want out. Reality check...WENGER IN. Enjoy being humiliated for the rest of the season.
This guy is a Jerk!
Troy is already a better pundit than 90% of them.
Massive respect for Deeney - He is spot on about us - no balls and too many good losers - it all comes from the manager .
Shut the fuck up u dick dick bastard
always like deeney. Cfc players could use some nuts
There's no leaders on the team smh
Fuck you I like u but fuck u ... won’t win the prem staying at that club watfuck
This don was in prison back in 2012
Arsenal are an embarrassment to our country full of pussy's with no pride! or passion light as fuck in the gut.
This must be embarrassing for a Arsenal fan and more so for the players...!
this is proof wenger has ruined the club. he can only focus on the nice side of the game and as a result all our players (except Kolasinac) are soft and have a weak mentality cos they lack grit and determination
Keown looks more like Tom Hanks at the end of Philadelphia every time I see him.
As a arsenal fan i have to agree with deeney its been arsenals problem for years
Thank you deeny for that the arsenal players need to wake up and look at this and the manager I have no words this club is declining
He scored last season against arsenal and he has done it again this.  So he can’t be crap
Every player must feel this way when they play arsenal and that's the problem. Weak mentality
This is funny. A Watford player telling Arsenal how it should be done
“Get up and whack someone” typical English player\nNo wonder England have won sweet fuck all at senior level\n\nWho taught this twat to whack someone on a football pitch\n\nNo class
Big up Deeney but real talk that wasn’t a penalty they played better than us in the second half and overall deserved it we would be 3rd right now if we could’ve just beat stoke and Watford but.....
Congrats you can score a penalty.
Arsenal became a beta cuck male club. Arsenal need to be Alpha and strong. Troy fucking Deeney from little Watford taking the piss not acceptabel
Man we should employ Troy as a speaker at arsenal. His blunt and gets straight to the point. Fair play lol.
So arsenal are not into puberty yet?
Troy could probably be a pundit
The referee doesn't have eyes.
There you go Arsenal fans - that's as real as you are going to get it - your team are a bunch of pansy Orange County preppy boys.
This is so embarrising man
I'm an Arsenal fan, but respect to this guy says what little commentators say.
Troy deeney is A real G
troy deeney is hyped because he beat arsenal. he's gonna lose his next 10 games so he can suck out blud
Thanks troy you a top mam you show arsene arsenal what they really are
The guy is savage on Arsenal's current team but you can tell how much he loved the old Arsenal, what he is saying is all true about that mentality that the current team have. You can tell he had a high respect for the old Arsenal the way he talks about them
Deeney is so real fair play
Get this guy in the England squad.
Troy Savage made a lot of sense in this discussion.
penalty evened out with jay Rodriguez one
Tell it Troy!
SPONSORED BY Snickers
Deeney a realist
Arsenal are shittt

Oh no nuts
Midfield of Xhaka and elneny, crappy forwards of iwobi and welbeck
Deeney 😂😂😂
Shit players
Spot on Troy, no bollocks just an honest brummy lad
Too many pussys at Arsenal.
man troy deeney is boss!!!!
Deeney new job Commentator after he retires deffo
Arsenal are bottle jobs
Savage
unreal from Deeney, should become a pundit
Yep, no nuts. Their trail mix is horrendous.
2:23 \nthank me later
theres so many things wrong with robbie savage. his name, his voice, accent, his skill or lack thereof, his analysis, his ponytail. neverending
Deeney is the type of dude you wanna smack in the face he is a absolute wanker of a human being 😲👍💯
Robbie fuck of you old wanker what have you dun for football nothing you wanker you just like Owen you talk shit after shit
Deeny you mums got nutz on her chest \nNext to the bean stains
Watford are bollocks with no history, no matter how shit the arsenal perform they'll never be better than us
If Deeney is a average player Giroud is what kind of a player 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Honestly Deeney is pretty underrated he's actually pretty decent and would be starting alongside rashford for England if Harry Kane wasn't alive
Trust Troy deenie is on a real ting most real baller out here today, the media today kills any sort of personality that players have, look in the NBA, the players are aloud to be outspoken and people buy their merch way more than in football, Nike/addidas need to start using footballers in a more personal way
Most refs hate Arsenal and Chelsea lets be honest, Man Utd and Liverpool have some that hate them and some that don't. Spurs are ref favorists. But Arsenal are the most hated even more than Chelsea, just by looking at the amount of penalties Arsenal are awarded in a season versus the amount they concede you can tell refs are harsh on Arsenal. Refs will give a penalty against Arsenal for little nibble challenges against small clubs and give Arsenal nothing for the same challenge like Arsenal is the smaller club.
He thinks he's so tough
Bitch shut the fuck if u won don't mean u better than arsenal dummy this pussy ass nigga is anyoinng wtf didn't u win against city
Arsenal have no nuts!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike an empty asylum
Usher's voice sound just as good as it did when he first came out!!!
Say whatever you want but Usher have the best vocals
Never considered usher fine or sexy but that boy can sing.
usher gave a bunch of humans herpys
Reggie could not care more for the skit at the beginning if you had paid him more to be
The last song really hit my soul deep deep down, they really don't make it like that anymore.
Luke Evans show me what love is
hot damn, luke evans is so hot. *yum yum yum* =*
SO MUCH TALENT IN A VIDEO
Luke evans can devour me any time.
Hey look, if it ain't the guy who gave HIV to dozens of womens without telling them he had HIV.\nCan't believe people are applauding this criminal, y'all should be ashamed.
Luke Evans, and Usher two gorgeous men with freaking hot
Luke Evans you killed it!!!
somebody get this guy a tic tac XD
Is it weird i do find James sexy lol
ANYONE?!?!?! Who sings the song they sang together?!
Never before noticed that ASS on Luke Evans! Fuck, I was stunned (in a wonderful way), like an unexpected and beautiful early Christmas present.
Luke Evans is sexy... it’s unfortunate that he’s gay 😕... I do love his singing voice
That's what I'm talking about!!
Luke is so hot
Luke is really a power house holy shit I wasn’t expecting that from Gaston
Y'all know Luke Evans is gay right
He rocks the supreme x lv tee
Damn its like a herpes convention
It's so sad a lot of people only know Luke Evans as Gaston. To me, he will always be Bard :)
Ok so Usher has never really done it for me but even I have to admit he was a bit sexy. Didn't know that Luke Evans could sing then I realised that hes in Beauty and the Beast so duh. He's looking a bit buff too.
No one sings like Gaston
Am I the only person who thinks that James Cordon can't sing. Like if you think so. His depth, and technique are not there.
I'll take luke evans please and thank you
Daaayyuuuuummmmnnnn the feeling *when the music is so good it just kept you smiling while crying* 😄😅😂
Well.  UHHHHH...... I'll take Luke Evans any day of the week! Yah smh ANY DAY!!!!
Dude. The Weeknd would murder all of these plebs.
NO ONE....\nVOCALIZES LIKE GASTON\nREPRISES SONGS LIKE GASTON\nSINGS FAST AND WORKS ASS ON THE STAGE LIKE GASTON!\nHE BE UP IN THE CLUB WITH THAT VOICE SINGING,\nMY HE SO FLY THAT GASTON!
How are people surprised that luke Evans could sing?! He came out in Beauty and the Beast he put him practicing on Instagram.
From Beauty and Beast know That Luke Evans Can sing he's Adorable😙
I want to know what love is with Luke Evans.. ❤😍
Damn, Luke Evan's is so... shiny.
hey i just released my first song it would be cool if you could check it out thank you!
Can Luke Evan be more sexy?  Geez!  I think I might be pregnant and I don't have ovaries or a uterus.
it reminds me of craig david
One of my favorite sign-off on late late night show...
Luke Evans def won but James was a close second- usher just wasn't his best tonight
Luke has me speechless over here.
Luke singing incredibly amazing shouldn’t be a surprise as he was Gaston!
the names of the songs please
Peace up; A town down I SCREAMED.
Usher didn't even have to try 💕 Corden is the best diva! Nobody sings like Gaston 😂
Did James not closing that drawer after he opened it bother anyone or is it just me ?....
Something became apparent when I listened to Luke without looking.  I found he can hit higher notes if he tried (probably played it save to not screw it up).  That would have smashed it through and through.

Usher voice is so smooth and warm here but ive heard him sound even smoother and more powerful live.  Saw him do full choreo for over 2 hrs and oh my gosh he sang through the whole thing- one of the best concerts ive ever been to. I was waiting for him to really show off but i still was impressed.  Luke .....whoohooo!! And James is simply darling. Best part was that end. They all sounded so damn good together!!!!!
LUKE EVANS FOR THE WIN!!!!!!
Let's be honest James Corden is a pretty good singer

I love the cabinet and the way you've organised it. 😍
It’s not the table. I think it’s the picture above it. You should leave the table and replace the picture with something smaller.

I need the link for the print!!!! OMG I need that in my life right now!!!
Hey Gabriella, I usually don't comment, but I watch your videos all the time... I thought that if you turn your leaf print to portrait instead landscape it might look better with a smaller cabinet. xx

When I last went to Brighton early sept and was so windy along the beach I had wind swept hair. Also went to the pier I see u did so much better at the arcades than me as when I went only won 4 tickets but no prizes and as didn't spend long enough or have enough coins that could use in arcades I didn't win any prizes but now I'm saving all my pennies from 1p to 50p to have a big bag for when I next go back to Brighton hopefully next year now in about April time

What the heck is with the carrot scissors!? That's ingenious 😍 so much easier than them pinging off the chopping board. Wow. Need that haha
Those adverts are really annoying.
Non
Don’t usually bother commenting on videos but this is my favourite vlog this year! ❤️
I normally get really upset when people cry, but cause she said it's PMS I couldn't stop laughing bc same 😂
Bill Clinton is missing from this group of men...
Don't forget your puppet master Clinton
Seth has sex with anchor babies
Harvey was banging Obama's daughter while she was doing her internship
I love how Seth and all his Hollywood hypocrites all forget that Bill Clinton was just as bad if not worse in his abuse of women. But that's OK to forget, because he is a Democrat. What hypocrisy!\nWoody Allen marries HIS DAUGHTER and Hollywood turns a blind eye........what arrogance....
Don't forget bill Clinton the rapist!
You forgot Bill Clinton!
Systematic sexism doesnt fucking exist
Luckely Trump did not murder more than 7 people investigating him.......like Bill and his wife did.......but you go on believe your own bullshit.  Seth is like a dog taking a s..t and then turns around and eats it. Thank God Harvey was outed......
The great interview of our time .very intelligent President
I don't like Donald trump
Unmarried women and men can be in the same room together?  Tell that to Saudi Arabia, whom we do billions of dollars of business with.
Fake news. Trump won, get over it.
All the sex scandals in the past year are left leaning, virtue signalling male feminists. The left projects SO HARD.
So, putting Trump and Weinstein in the same video makes them the same - now I know how common core math works - retarded
A closer look more like a bunch of lies and trash please go clean that mouth sir
the Clinton body count   goole it
It should be called power entitlement. Any gender can exploit power.
I'm really sick and tired of this so called comedians, those who enjoy their nonsense are morons like them, what a sad time we live in. I feel sad for this generation!
Also that nobody bringing back dinosaurs, think about it dude, it will be possible
How is it that HOLLYWOOD continues to throw praise and accolades at the feet of Woody Allen?  Hello?  He basically married his step-daughter!
Trump and Weinstein are cut from the same cloth. Both take advantage of women. I hate them both.
It always has to involve trump 🙄
When exactly do we recognize the late night shows inability to be comical anymore and their outright obsession with the man who they claimed would never be president
the first two seconds of this video is already revolting.  This week we see how powerful man...  really?  Where were you when Bill Clinton harass women all over the country?   You don't even want to talk about Bill anymore.  If any other powerful man harass or rape any woman, they learn from your old pal, Bill Clinton.
God you are such a nauseating sanctimonious libtard. All of your Dumbacraps & Hillarywood elitists were complicit in allowing this sexual predator to operate with impunity & just like Broom Hillary the witch pissed all over our laws for over 35 years so did Harvey Weinstein. You own him libiot, this is your NBC who buried this story because your CEO is a screen writer so STFU you contemptuous troll. After 36 years as a Democrat I couldn't vote for a party that drove itself off a left-wing and was run by a silver tongued BS artist & I wasn't going to vote for Satan's daughter.
As an artist, Seth, this video , makes me so upset.. how can you compare art to politics... I suppose I am innocent, but there are so many movies that Harvey Weinstein has made that are now... upsetting... I am hurt.  I knew politics are dirty.. Trump  is mild compared to Clinton.. wtf!
What does Seth have to say about Hillary supporting and protecting actual rapists and pedos, Bill, Podesta, and Harvey?  Nothing.\nThe left is always projecting.  Wasn't it Ashley Judd, the nasty woman, all about Trump's alleged sexism?  Why did she allow so many  women and girls to be molested by Harvey?  Why didn't she come forward sooner?  Why didn't most of Hollywood, all the ones that knew, come forward as soon as it happened?  Oh yeah, leftards can't be misogynists.  It would make all their grandstanding at the Oscars, Emmys, et al, against Trump look pathetic and imbecilic.  😂
A woman of color? What color? White???!!!!!
Lol trolling show at best...  Hey buddy. \n\n Bill Clinton?  Or maybe his wife ignoring his act of rape\n...  Right..  What a fucking clown this host is
Your show, systematic ass kissing of anyone with a the title democrat attached.
So words from Trump rate more condemnation than Bill Clinton's sexual exploitation of an intern and Hillary's smear tactics used to shame his victims???? Not trying to take sides here but can late night audiences not look past their personal politics to see that late night television is working overtime to tell America what to think? To the point of taking the misdeeds of a liberal elite and back route them to yet another attack on Trump. These political pundits in clown makeup have us hating on each other.
Probably thinks he can come back in a year because that's what his company said before firing him.
Wow. are you really this deluded? Do you even know anything about puerto rico? A large portion was a bombing range for decades, rife with corruption and drugs. Conversely,  he sent two hospital ships, and numerous military assests and supplies. The so called leader allowed local union's to stiffle the distributuon of relief supplies. I sincerely hope you are not as naive as these tirades your writers provide you.
Late night shows are now dogshit
I'm a dinosaur and I'm typing rawr don't discriminate me
Seth misses the even stupider fact that Networks aren't licenced by the Federal government television broadcast stations are. A very, very big distinction even for a (wannabe) dictator like Trump..
Remember when late night hosts were funny and weren't tools for the Liberal machine?\nRemember when Clinton cheated on his wife with all those comedians thought it was funny??
This stupid guy always used trump name to get views and usually it's bullshit
Seth...is a moron!! Looks like he found the right job!!!
Set Myers is a bore
You've had 13 months to bash Trump, you just can't let go eh?\nYour network killed the Harvey Weinstein story when it came out years ago.
Remember when this sissy Seth cried the day after the election because his mom's name is Hillary? lmao
Donald Trump hasn't bullied anyone. Performance of dominance... Yes. We have a real Leader and he will be here again in 2020 haha
Just stopped in to give a thumbs down. 👎#Billclintonisarapist
Seth Meyers we know you're an idiot but come on who the hell takes steps on escalator idiot
im sure if Hillary was president the Weinstein thing wouldve been swept under the rug .
Cuck. I'm a woman by the way.
Here's some video evidence.\nhttps://youtu.be/bXIYa0iGW4E
Wow, I think Seth is one of the smartest men in the world.   He really knows what he is talking about..    He is a political genius!!!.
This is so funny....
Wiener, Weinstein...who’s next...?
Slick Willy.
The trump hate continues.
Beta
Shame on you Seth.....smh
Trump's a worthless asshole
Trump2020\nNo comparison
Brilliant.
https://youtubem.video/r/?FhbrK0GDrB4LLaUfj8tGLfvLuAec9HZrPb=CBstUUMHIMENZokFcpeNAETDpCC76Ehls
Marty Nesbitt and Anita Blanchard made Malia and Sasha.
The difference between Weinstein and Trump is that the media weren't desperately trying to smear Weinstein in any way they could.
yeah make weinstein scandal about trump. Anything to get the spotlight away from the true, hypocritical, tyrannical rapists: hollywood liberals. Don't be fooled everyone. Seth meyers is a terrorist who defends his fellow rapists in hollywood. Seth Meyers and everyone in hollywood knew about weinstein (and others like him) and never said a damn thing about it. and even joked publicly about it.
Funny that Seth is on the network that pushed the Weinstein story under the carpet. NBC is as much to blame for being complicit as anyone else.
...Hey, what happened to Bill Clinton’s face? You forgot to flash that one! BC was/is ANOTHER RAPIST, and we nearly gave him back the WH. I hate Trump, and Weinstein, and all sex predators, including Bill C.
Seth accuses the right of trying to politicize the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault story in a 10 minute video where he tries to show how Trump is just like Weinstein. Weinstein had no conection to Trump, but he sure as heck had plenty of ties to leftist politicians. The leftist politicians have been kissing his booty in echange for money for decades. Seth Meyer you are the ultimate political hack, not Kelly Anne Conway. To even try to conpare Trump to Weinstein is so dishonest. All sexual assault charges thrown against Trump were dropped right after the election. Of course Seth doesn't mention that. It doesn't fit his bull crap narrative.
lol. Trying to tie the liberal rapist with trump. The left is trying way too hard. They're just a joke now. What a waste of space party.
And of course Bill Clinton and his little trips to Rape Island with his liberal pedophile buddies. Did you forget Seth? Or did you go too? Or just another pervo nutbar Leftist snotty ugly mush-brained Illuminati hypocrite?
notice absence of Bill Clinton.
*PSA* -\nProject Veritas EXPOSES YOUTUBE for _altering the trending page_ and _news carousels_ in your feed.
LOl can't even take a clean crack at Weinstein without dragging the lefty hate against Trump.  THis is why people are turning against Hollywood.  Their morally superior attitude
LIBERALS ARE THE CANCER CANCER GETS...
I farted in an Apple Store \n\nThey kicked me out \n\nIt's not my fault they don't have windows 🙄
This is hard to watch,  no matter how you look at it.  Move on you lost to that orange fat man,  now act like a man and confront sexual misconduct in the media  business..
Oh Seth Myers is a Tool!
This would be MUCH more interesting if hillary was president and they had Bill Clinton instead of trump... cause then they would have a real story..
How can you insert the Presidents comments into the same conversation as the actual sexual assault of dozens of women
I made it thru 2:30 terrible video, least likable light night host
Listen to this asshole,,,He forgets to mention this is the same guy who gave millions to the Democratic Party,,more specifically to bill and Hillary ,,this is why u can't believe anything these puppets say.
This guy is a clown
OMG this politically correct bullshit makes me want to kill myself with all of hos audience. what has the world truned in 2.
Interesting, Weinstein is DEM. You have to blame Trump for that.
There are several videos that prove seth is flat out wrong or lying. Carson, Letterman & Leno never did this crap.
This guy is still on TV. He's not even funny.
What happened to comedy?
Wow making fun of Trump. How original
Fire the cucks at youtube that have this trending😂
Total bullshit to compare them both. Systematic sexism????. Seth keep to your corny jokes.
Does he mention Bill Clinton in this? Didn't think so. Trump, Weinstein and Clinton: all scum. And so are their enablers.
All this is is a lame ass attempt on the left to shift the focus from their disgusting shithole Hollywood culture and try to deflect into some kind of trump bashing
So Weinstein basically rapes 20 or more women over 30 years and trump brags about grabbing women and this is the same thing to liberals. Keep pretending you liars. What an insult to these poor women who were put through this BS
You really have to bring up Donald Trump? Who has done nothing to a woman sexually (Other say some comments in what he thought was a private conversation) and hasn’t really done anything to women otherwise. And you compare him to this scumbag. How about Bill Clinton? You are so biased he can’t even breath without you going on about him. And attacking him constantly. None of those woman were telling the truth. Kinda funny how they don’t come forward till he was doing well as a candidate.  And it was proven that it didn’t happen. Shame on you.
liberal bs
Liberal propaganda
eat a fucking chode seth
More like systematic non-comedy agenda.
This mayor? http://dailycaller.com/2017/09/30/san-juan-mayor-praised-convicted-faln-terrorist/
wow.... turning a completely unrelated scandal into an attack on trump based on unsubstantiated bullshit. I hope the nazi hitler monster trump pelts everyone in the corporate legacy media to death with rolls of paper towels.
SUCKERS. \nYou people are so fucking gullible. \nTrump was caught on tape ONCE only TALKING about women.\nHarvey Weinstein has had at least eight legal cases settled and about 20 more women are accusing him.\nBill Clinton RAPED a woman, harassed a dozen more, sexually exploited a young girl in the Oval Office and even stuck a cigar up her fucking vagina.\nAnd now these late night lowlifes are COMPARING them with Trump? \nThere's about as much evidence to back that up as there is for this Trump/Russia bullshit; namely, NONE. \nBut that won't stop these late night low rent leftwing hacks from leading you mindless fools around by the nose.\nYou morons deserve each other. \nI need to go clean my guns now to be ready for Jimmy Kimmel when he comes to confiscate them. \nOh, he won't? \nTypical liberal chickenshits. \nNever willing to get their own hands dirty.\nAlways getting others to do their dirty work.\nTTYL, suckers.
Can't even talk about Weinstein without deflecting to Trump. How pathetic.
Oh God, he is so damn good at telling stories!!
Turns into Walter White at 4:10
OMG I love this guy sooo much  XD
Colin Farrell's hair is on point
He didn't play Hal from Malcolm in the middle. He IS Hal from Malcolm in the middle!
He probably misheard 15 for 50.
Hitman really let himself go
Bryan using british terms like Trousers and car for a train good on him fairplay
Like a blind man at an orgy, I was going to have to feel things out.
He's the one that knocks
I feel like I’ve heard this story before 🤔🤔
Who else read the title as Bryan Cranston Got Caught Having A Sex Tunnel In The Alps
Anyone else notice Colin Farrell has his Fantastic Beasts haircut? I hope he comes back, he was one of the best parts (Much better than Johnny Depp).
Graham is better than any American talk show host. Easily. Stupid scripted yanks.
Wow his story telling skills are great.
He reverted back to the hilarious Hal from Malcolm in the Middle days
Nicole Kidman looking like a snack 😍
 Say no more 
2:41 - ROFL tho bald guy nailed it :-D
Should of have had him on the red chair!
Or did his wife say stay out of my territory!
What I love about ‘The Graham Norton!” The guest combinations , I came to see the guy from breaking bad , also got Nardole (Matt Lucas)
Ukh that farrell such a hillbilly... doesn't know how to act in public... go dig up some potatoes 🥔....

SATANIC HOLLYWOOD
Maybe the travel agent said 15 and hopeful Brian Cranston heard 50 xD
he told this story in a interview like a year ago
he Awesome in Malcolm in the middle...
Tunnelling a tunnel in the tunnel.
Maybe the agent said 15 minutes, but he heard 50.
He's a master story teller
i like how he is pants in america but says trousers in the uk..
I Love You So Dam Much Graham Norton!
Absolutely love the man!
god this man is funny
Hahah he’s so good at story telling 😂👌🏾
This is the most ridiculous awesome story everrr LMAO!
Bryan Cranston is just such a great guy! Comedic, theatrical and plain nice.
How can you not love Bryan Cranston
That was a really good train noise
I’m just seeing and hearing Hal
Robin??? His frank underwood's wife claire his real life wife?
His voice is amazing!!! A la morgan freeman
And then he took meth.
The description is legit.
After hearing the story its clear Cranston misheard the travel agent and mistook 15 mins for 50 mins
This smokin hot mo***F*****er is 61!! o_O
What a weird story to tell lol didn't think he'd go into details lol god damn it Hal! Lois must've been mad
been watching Graham Norton since V Graham norton on channel 4 , who remeber when Big Brovaz came on
So you could say, he found a stranger in the alps..
Colin's joke at the end LMAO
SEE WHAT HAPPENS\nWHEN YOU FIND A STRANGER IN THE ALPS
I can see the memes
best story teller, him and Chris Pratt
Colin’s hair looks awesome! Very 90s. I love it.
Bryan is not Walter white but he really hal
I can't stop laughing at his impression of italians 😂 so on point expecially the gesture at 3:59
Mute the sound. Bryant's visual action is more interesting and easy to understand lol
Bryan really knows how to tell a story. He is brilliant!!! :D
Must say ., Brian's 📓 makes a great *read., \n\nSadly, no bits @ v% 🌹🎦 event., or London specifically., wit 'Malcolm [ the Middle 📺🎬'. \n\nGlorious last line by moi Total *mC2F by Colin. 💙😎
You know what would be funny, if we found out he had sex with an alp in a tunnel.
I would invite him to my party!
He is the one who knocks.Makes sense 😂😂
The Heisenberg part of Bryan's brain kicked in when he said Get Off Me
IS THAT NARDOLE
Amazing story teller. Lol
Say no more. -Bryan Cranston 2017
I love him
me lol
Crystal!  ;)
Colin Firth is HOOOOOT
I caught him 😂
Fat 47
Did that journey about 15 years ago. Quite a rush! People in other cars put their internal lights on though... it's a bit distracting under the time constraints! Highly recommended though!
he always do it in breaking bad ^^
Matt Lucas proved he still has that comedic timing. Grew up watching shooting stars and little britain. Looks like a quality couch on graham tonight.
Colin Farrell: Hold my beer.
Amazing story :D
All hail Bryan Craston for this story XDXD
Awesome
Say no more fam.. 😂😂😂
Great story. Cranston is cool.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Great story. Xx
Hot videos http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5uxdP9lmOrTlkmHjG8owmnnZ5ikZsmQ9
Sounds good 😂😂😂
Great couch Graham!
I love how he told this story word for word on Conan a couple months ago. Cranston you dirty dog
This would have been an awesome if they hadn't had Bryan Cranston on the show. He is intolerable.
Bryan Cranston is a SOCIALIST LIBERAL QUACK who wants to DESECRATE places because he’s a LIBERAL and LIBERALS destroy everything and want to destroy a generation of proud Christian republicans like myself.\nNO TO SOCIALIST QUACKS\n\nTRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP
What does Colin Farrel say at 4:38 ?
From his gestures and that cross that he made I can totally belive Colin is gay
2:39 Did Nicole think Bryan was going to jump on her? xD
Damn he is a bit to expressive with his hands
Argo w Ben
Daaaang. You can see Courtney Love really doesn't want Harvey there. She's just staying out of the conversation. She obviously know this man was trouble.
Ahh the paparazzi ... who said they were good for nothing? It's clips like this that keep on giving.
wow and based on her Twitter Jessica Chastain was supposed to hate Harvey... lol Jessica is so full of shit. I've gained so much respect for Courtenay for this
Love you, C Love! Live Through This got me through puberty. Nice to know you were all about the sisterhood and weren't fake. Those actresses had to pretend to be interested in conversing with him for risk of losing work, Courtney didn't have anything to lose and has always been punk. Love this.
They're ALL animals.
Lol... this video is actually getting more views now than when it was put out.
Lmfao Courtney's side-eye at 0:12
Courtney love like,\nBye Felicia, Bye
Courtney doesnt look too thrilled.
Chastain was wanting to be Harvey's star so bad. Such a lying hypocrite. Just like McGowan who says she was raped by Weinstein in 1997 but hugging him in 2007.
Dress: White and Gold\nVans: Grey and Turquoise\n\nThat's just what i see and i literally don't understand how people say the Blue and Black on the dress and the Pink and the White on the trainer?!?
It's lighting, but when y'all say grey and teal it's just grey for me, I'm colourblind with colours on/with grey
Nah I always saw pink and white!
its pink and white just sfu already. if you see anything else than pink and white u r just colorblind
The shoes white and pink
Is it just me that can see grey and mint ?
Subscribed you're vlogs are so funny 😊
I see grey and mint too
i see pink and white!
Who else thought that his jumper said Succ life 😂
It's black and red
I always saw this shoe as pink but now I see both😂
That shoe is pink and white
THAT SHOE IS GREY AND A TURQUOISE COLOUR!!!!!
COLDPLAY JOE I LOVE YOU

At first, I saw grey and mint. After a few minutes, I saw white and pink.
It's pink and white
I see it Grey and mint
I see GRAY AND MINT!!!😊
it's *rose quartz* and *white*
hes such a tease he knows he can sing smh
when my brother showed me it yesterday, at first I saw grey and mint green but I looked again like a few minutes later and they where pink with white stripes, and I have seen pink and white ever since.
I see pink and white. My wife sees grey and mint.
Get an image of the shoe then on iPhone you invert the colour in settings and it will change from mint and grey to pink and white
Your a good singer and your good at playing the guitar
I really want to see it as pink and white but I can't!
I really want to see the mint and grey but I just can't like I only see the pink and white
It’s pink and white wtf are you on?
VFT need a really warm spot, really warm, tropical warm, or they won't.
What colour is my PS4...
Joe playing a guitar and singing 😍😍😍❤️❤️
You are funny Joe.
I see mint and grey
BTS ARMY WHERE U AT
NOOOOO! I was seeing pink and white and then BAM it changed to mint and grey! 😵
It looks grey and mint
I agree with u joe
Purple. But I'm kinda colour blind anyway.
Wtf, I saw the thumbnail as pink and white then it changed to green and grey and now I cant see pink again!
Bruh its the wtf colour is the dress all over again
I definitely needed that arrow to show me where the shoe was
I see it mint and grey 😂
I'm not gonna lie, when I saw this in my subscriptions it looked pink and white and that's the first time I've ever seen it pink... But now I'm looking at the thumbnail again and it looks mint and grey again 🤔
I see gray and mint
What guitar does he have?
It's pink and white
It looks pink and white with a blue filter over it or something
First it's what what colour is this jaguar now it's what colour is this shoe what's next what colour is Donald Trumps hair?.
I saw it as blue and black. But with the shoe I could change my eyes to either see pink and white or mint and grey like I could tell my eyes to see something pink or mint
You should of used a air horn
Translated= what caption can we put on the video picture to click bait this time ??????
Guys, when you turn the brightness down it’s pink and white, simple
Please don't start this again
Who else now needs an actual cover of the scientist from joe and Bryon🙋🏼
Mint and grey all the way

Pink and white
He sometimes reminds me of Jacksepticeye.
Wish i knew how to play guitar
its mint and grey
Alfie is a closet gay I reckon
I see the same thing as Zoe
The masks chin looked like a ball bag
I should start making music myself again. Just realised how much I enjoy making music seeing you playing the guitar ☀
In the thumbnail if i try i cant see both
WTF MY DAD HAS THAT GUITAR Crazy
i saw white and mint blue, then when i scrolled down and saw this again in trending i now see it as pink and white. Wtf!
You’re such a talented guitarist! x
I see the pink part of the shoe but the laces are MINT
Its not a shoe, its a phone
Guys, yesterday i watch this video and saw Grey and mint shoe and couldnt understand HOW THE HELL someone can saw there pink and white. Today i was looking at the picture of this shoe in the mirror from 6meters distance for a very long time and i literally saw IT a little bit pink and white but also Grey and mint. After that i was looking at this picture very often today and start to see more and more pink and white. A while ago i decided to watchi this video again, and what i saw???? PINK AND WHITE. I was like what the HELL. Our brain is so weird and i feel like it is playing with me...
That is 100% green and grey, not pink and white, someone edited to look that colour but it definitely is green and grey
Aha lol I see mint and grey
The shoe is Mint and grey
joe is just too funny
Pink and white
Ball sack chin
Its pink idiots
Pink and white
Succ life?
Sing it joe
Pink and white
THEY'RE FUCKING PINK AND WHITE, VANS DON'T DO THEM IN THAT COMBINATION, AND I HAVE A FUCKING PAIR OF THE WHITE AND PINK VANS. ALSO, IF YOU THINK IT'S GREY AND MINT, YOU'RE PROBABLY LOOKING AT IT FROM AN IPHONE, AS IPHONES HAVE BRIGHTER BLUE LIGHT LIGHT OVERALL WHICH IS WHY YOU SEE THE SHOE THAT WAY. I CAN DEFINITELY SEE WHY YOU DO BUT YOU'RE A FUCKING AUTIST IF YOU ACTUALLY THINK IT'S GREY AND MINT
I’m going to be having nightmares about ballbag billy what ever his name is 😂😂😂😂
DONT WORRY AYESHA, THATS NORMAL COMPARED TO TAMERA GIVING RASPBERRIES TO ADAM'S STOMACH
Idris for Loni. Common for Jeannie and now Ayesha for Tamera. All their crushes.
Ain't nothing wrong with a little foot fetish lmao
Makes me sad for my horrible looking feet
He's going to kill me.... yes he is girl!! 🤣🤣🤣 do you know how bad the NBA & his teammates are going to make fun of him!? Lmaoooooo damnnn...no championship this year 💀
Loni all in her damn phone I know she was thinking back up bitch!
IDRIS ELBA HAS OPENED UP THE FLOOD GATES
You've got a fetish for my feet, I push you out and you come right back.
I really don't get the foot thing.
she need to be part of the team
Y'ALL NEED TO KEEP AYESHA ON THE PANELLLLL
KEEP AYESHA!! ADD her to the Cast!!
He gone get clowned in the locker room now..well done. You set your own husband up lol
Attention the real, keep Ayesha pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
I don't see what the problem is I mean they are married, and I love feet as well.
The ladies look stunning loving Loni's makeup and hair!!!!! Tamera all season has been slaying.
Idris Elba out here making foot fetish okay 😩😩😩
Welcome to the club Steph 😁
Send feet baby
I relate to him but, why she let them bait her lol
Real niggas suck on toes
Idris literally just said last week that feet gets him too!!!
I love feet and Ayesha's a pretty girl but her feet r okay. She fucked up because now steph gone get hella Dms of IG girls feet. He won't be able to contain himself
I bet Currys DM's full of feet. LMAO
I fw Steph lightskin girls always got pretty feet and white girl
I thought he liked fooking the calves...
Thats really cute🙃
Men who are turned on by feet are weird to me.
I have feet fetish as well. Girls with bad feet is a major turn off for me.
Lowkey not even a fetish, pretty feet be lookin raw as hell lmao
And I bet Steph is going to be label as a foot creep.
The ONLY way I'll watch the real again, after the shameful way they treated Tamar, is to bring her back. I'll also settle for Ayesha Curry cuz Tamar is booked!
I would love for Ayesha to be a host!!!
So Steph Curry has a foot fetish?  Maybe he likes to suck toes
He's going to kill her 😂😂😂

I like that though very unusual but kind of cute too.
Because he has that Quentin Tarantino foot fetus. Look up Thai foot massage 😂😂😂
These show's are perfect for my low IQ. \nOnly 4100 views and this crap is trending?
Women in their natural habitat. Cluck cluck clucking

Stephen 😍😍😍💕🙈

Lol lonis facial expressions
One of us. One of us. One of us.
Yay Ayesha Curry!
Lana är så fin
Loni hype. He's married fat ass
motherfuckers are weird
Well now we know something about him... He like feet! She a size 10 mind you!!!! 🙊 I love you Ayesha don’t come for me I’m just saying!
What's with Adrienne and the oversized one sleeved shirts😂😂😂
Monkey feet.
Y'all seen that video of a light skin sucking on that one girls feet? Must be lightskin thing to be into feet
Black Fat bitches!!!!
Fucking normies infest everything and now they are heading for the fetishes 🙄
Yeah that's nasty
Do people actually think DC is sophisticated? Or is that just a goof they made up?
I've become so numb to these countless fucking pop culture movies.
The best podcast ever!
Looking forward to Rich Evans new food review channel, Previously Digested.
The hats...the sideways hats are what killed me.
They got me started on the laughing and I couldn't stop. They built a premise and sold it well. The acting, editing, sarcasm, all on point.
This is very cool.. very very cool.
Fucking Star Wars, I FUCKING LOVE STAR WARS!
Disney owns Star Wars & ESPN, which was broadcasting Monday Night Football, resulting in trailer debut.
i don't care what the video is about, as long as rich fucking loves star wars
i think rich jumped the shark on this one
You’ve ruined reaction videos for me. Thank you (I mean it)!
I’m done with Star Wars. The only bits of any Stars Wars movies I see are here on RLM. The Nerd Crew has more character development and interesting story archs than any Star Wars movie after Return of the Jedi.
Nerd Crew - Yes, we're all individuals!\nMe - I'm not o.0
People actually enjoy this low effort garbage?
8:25-10:20 I laughed my ass off the entire time hahahah.
OH SHIT THEY HAVE A MYSPACE????
Did anyone else notice how, in their reaction and breakdown, there was an underlying theme of family?
This shit was hilarious LMAO spot on!!! This shit is so accurate it's like y'all predicting the future, while you're at it can to tell me what the winning Power Ball numbers will be next week?
I fucking love you.
Is Mr.PiggyEats a real joke channel? Anyone have a link?
You could have put a beat and some rhythm to voice montage part to this...
Jesus fucking christ, this is done too well.  I mean that literally.  It apes the actual vacuous, worthless youtube shitbags so perfectly that I can't stand to fucking watch it.
Who is the target demographic anymore? Who are they making fun of? How deep does it go? I get it, we're tired of Super Hero and Disney nonsense... someone link me a channel theyre mocking. Im missing the joke.
This time it had an echo
Wait. When was Jay on ScreenJunkies? ?
Nerd Crew is ultimately about family.
I fucking hate these...but I can't stop watching them.
This is too much. Oozing with beautiful sarcasm. Devastatingly sardonic. Nice look from the panel 😅
I know you're just making jokes about a specific brand/style of sponsored video, but do you think this is actually entertaining? I'm Drunk and I only made it 35sec in.
It broke new ground
It really fucking sucks being a nerd sometimes...
Borderline elderly - you're 40. You literally hit the hill this year. You're exactly middle-aged.
With all the sexual harassment and sexual assault from Hollywood (Weinstein) and Youtube (Honest Trailers) Which one of you guys are going to go down for sexual harassment and or assault?\n\nEdit: Just finished the video. The end of the video screwing the porg, answered my question. LOL love how you guys shit all over all the fake reviewers, reminded me of Angry Joes review of the new Star Trek.
“Even though I was on ScreenJunkies once, I guarantee I’m not a dirtbag”\n\nMy sides
why does rey need to be trained?  she did all the jedi shit in the first film..............  you know the shit luke couldn't do until he trained....  what the fuck is he going to teach her?  he's been in hiding forever.  and he was never that great with the force didn't fucking little sex bears help him beat the empire?
Only six min into this and u guys r Fukin killin me.  ITS THE SAME BUT ITS DIFFERENT! should be at the bottom of all the posters.
I hate how hollow this industry has become
I'm at a place where i have to be really quiet, and watching this made me start cracking up...
these segments are the best things YouTube has to offer
Died laughing.  Also a deep deep sadness.  Thanks a lot.
Nerd Crew is where Jay is at his best.
Rich reviews fast food.....the Young Sheldon of The Nerd Crew?
More fake reaction videos. Jenny called all of them out. Bam! You've been served.
You bloated hacks, Reviewbrah has forgotten more about reviewing than you could ever hope to learn.
I thought the plot twist to their trailer reactions was that they all were going to be in the same room sitting next to each other.
make Mr.piggyeats a real channel
Ever been to Hurley?
Why isn't MrPiggyEats a real channel?!?!?!!
Me personally, I would love another prediction sesh for Episode VIII. This was very good though.
I'M GUNNA CUMMMMMM (I scream this at work too much...)
I've seen junk food reviews that were actually worse/less detailed than the Rich Evans one here.
12:00 thank you god, rich evans said Dostoevsky. I've been reading that nigga lately. Crocodile, Demons, and Crime and Punishment, all fantastic. 10/10 would recommend
Legit Star Wars ads are running on this video!! LOL!! Bravo #RLM\n\nAlso 8:15 on is fucking art!!
This series has jumped the Gungan.
Bleeped empire strikes back...that hit me in the feels sack...very cool
Still the best on YouTube
Gotta love the concept of making fun of repetitiveness in film as they point out the same shit they do every single video they make on it.
These videos quite literally give me life like that fat fuck at screen junkies who molested cats or whatever the fuck.
Rich Evans is the food critic we deserve, but not the one we need right now.
Ranked #8,967 in online source for movie trailer reaction videos...\n\n#1 in our hearts.
The most creative hack frauds.  Love these guys.
NERD CREW IS THE BEST THING RLM HAS DONE.
Rich is always high AF
Hey buttheads. Stop acting so fucking goofy and make normal videos. Anymore of that sarcasm and I’ll commit suicide.
Jesus I needed to take a nap half way through. This video was a real test of attrition.
Mike's Star Wars suit jacket costs $120.00 ... *what would Tyler Durden think?*
A lot of big youtubers are shitting on fast food reviewers lately. I hope they're not referencing reviewbrah because he is the original and his persona is at least as interesting as his content if not more. Any other fast food reviewers are fair game but reviewbrah is a national treasure.
I love this shit so much
This is the anti Collider Videos.
I can't stand the Beyond The Trailer videos. That woman Grace talks like a complete fucking weirdo.
It's so dense guys.
Very cool. 👍
This is great
Very Cool.
Avant Garde Youtubing.
I really find these voices grating.
Hmmm these guys seem like hack frauds..
Collider and screen junkies are garbage!
Shit a pile of Gamorean guards?!

Stop watching Hollywood bullshit.
EXCEPT, it's not trailer 2 it is trailer 1. Previously there was the teaser trailer, and a behind the scenes feature.\nTrailer 2 is still forthcoming.
I laugh at this, but I'm not much different from the people they're making fun of lol. I don't mind being the butt of a joke though.
Lucasfilm logo FUCK YES!!! Gotta clap for it.
I visited my grandpa today and had to think about your honest and deep thoughts about old people and how they're feeling lonely and have nobody to talk to. \nI love helping other people and i hope to find a way to get involved here in Germany. \nI love how you always say what is on your mind, wether it's funny or sad, positive or negative. \nI find that very inspiring!
Okay, I was just thinking about this... but I realized that Alfie names everything Rodney 😂 like in one of Zoella's 2015 Halloween videos, he called the blow up pumpkin Rodney lol. But LBW!!!!
Alife to stop spiders coming in to your house you can either cut up lemon and put them by your window or get some peppermint oil and mix it with water and spray it around your windows and door by the way spiders tend to hide in the corner of rooms because they are the warmest
My favourite vlogger 😊

Hey alphi.. I wanted to know that can I buy you products over seas as I live in India!
Have you got any plans for Halloween this year? For more fun Halloween ideas, see here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUVNHh2hkGU&t=4s&list=PLQ_T2NppE0PITf7-JByJOwq3HVZRvP7P8&index=1
Like the idea, but meh, too much work
if you dont have those acrylic letters, just carve a letter into the pumpkin. Save money
I could of use a sharpie and write happy Halloween then shine a light on the front of the pumpkin.
Another hand picked trending video by yours truly, Susan. \n\nPretty neat, huh?

To clarify, just because you can find an image on Google doesn't mean it's legal. This law is very loosly enforced but still is a law.
Hold my croissant🇫🇷
i never knew of this at all. super interesting
But can we still jizz on it?
Guess what.\n\n\n\n\nI just looked up: *video of Eiffel Tower at night* :)
so i can go to jail SCREAMS
Did you say pakistan??\nOr was it just me?\nBtw I am from pakistan
Good thing we're leaving the EU and France can't catch me.
Let me Google Eiffel tower at night, oh wait there are thousands of pictures of it at night. Better call the police to start investigating so we can lock these down right low life criminals up.
No ones gives a fuck about this copyright In France
Fuck the EU... Forcing us to take in imagrants.
All this for a SQUARESPACE commercial.
So it's illegal just because it has some lights on?\n\nThat's fucking stupid.
Isint the illusion that were free Grand
how time fast go sun to planet us in minutes????? i need now
just take a photo and don't do something commercial with it and you're fine
This is why Chris chann's recent video of the phone flip off the eifel tower got copyrighted, the original probably had footage of it at night, but the new version doesn't have any footage of it at night. Crazy.
Illegal to take? - perhaps\nIllegal to show? - nope\nIs this video useless? - yes
I ha e been to Paris, France, and I have taken multiple photos of the Eiffel Tower, especially at night. And that was a year ago. I have even uploaded them to Facebook and I didn't get no 5-0's banging on my door, the pics are even on my Twitter.
Oh, just show it at night you Gimp.
Laws can be stupid sometimes
I don't give a shit, I'm going there and filming that motherfucker fuck the french.
I hate copyright regarding image and video and should be rid of
So here is a question if you are trying to make something that is copyrighted but the original maker dead and the copyright is still in effect
Why I should photograph the eifel tower? Its a ugly bunge of metal. Phalic symbol for a phalic age...
* goes to Paris at night *\n* takes a picture *\n* sells it on the deep web *
Searched up Eiffel Tower and the image you see for its description is a picture of the tower at night.
Same thing for the Sistine chapel
Did web driver torso died because of this?
Wtf? So this soft French tower is the profit Mohamed now? Gtf out of here. This is 'murica. Ima take a picture of wtv I want and sell it to the highest bidder.
Aren't protection laws just amazing?
*must take photo of Eiffel Tower at night and try to sell them*
I legit Googled eiffel tower rn and the first pic I see is of it at night
Punched that shit in to Google came right up \nLot of pictures of it at night
sorry I used squarespace to run an illegal underground extreme children cage fight league federation and our hottest selling store item is illegal photos of building in public spaces.
yo i have some photos of this on my phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFBI: *knock knock knock* Open up this is the FBI!
I photographed and videoed the Eiffel Tower last night. Oops...
this is very interesting
they should just build invisible building with invisible light ugh
Fuck off i dont care\nI will just pee in the french streets
The copyright system needs some regulation. Because companies  are literally abusing the whole system and using their bullshit to fuck others over. For example cough cough youtube. We should be able to take pictures of a fucking building at day or night.
Hahahaha fuck off with copyright laws I still have never bought a single music album. Fuck the system.
Shawn Mendes did something illegal in his newest music video
My parents have a picture of that at night
personally you can take pictures and use it....just not commercial use
Let's be honest the French people and France are stupid.
Was jesus a virgin
I think that is such a dumb law in my opinion it's just a bunch of lights get over it 😑
How come movies are allowed them then???
I shall copyright all the trees at day\n\n\n*Now everyone is arrested, yay!*\n*Not me I am an introvert*
Lol I have plenty of pics of the tower. Is the EU gonna come after me?
Can't wait for 2055!
You just got yourself a 195,024th subscriber !!
A judge will say this is bullshit
How did apple get theirs for the apple watch?
4 minutes just say lights on tower still copyrighted Anyway, what if there was a power outage in Paris and the lights didn't turn on the Eiffel Tower at night? Would we be able to use a picture of the Eiffel Tower commercially then?
So if i set the iso so small for the light bulbs to show  i can sell the damn picture?
This is completely idiotic. A building....copyrighted?
but what about in the movie rush Hour they show the Eiffel tower at night
Soo what you are saying is to use square space for illegal photos? Okay got ya! 😉👌
This is so fucking retarded
What if you take a video of the Eiffel Tower and freeze frame it?
That's stoooped!\n\nSaid everyone
U ass hole don't spread rumours go to Google sass hole there are so many pics of night view of Eiffel tower
Don't even bother looking through the comments, smh
I'm gonna punch something.
u guys want a video of the eifell tower at night go to snapchat
U could have gotten a fair use doctrine because this falls under education
Why it's in my recommendation
Fuck that retarded rule. Its like whipping out my dick in public and having everyone who took a picture of it arrested.
Wait so the copyright of the Eiffel Tower ended but because someone put lights on it reset? So we have to wait a lifetime and 70 years because someone put Christmas lights on a 100 year old structure. Okay then
Only 29th on trending? You can do better than that!
My comment should be popular
Large Prison Dude: So what u here 4 man?\n\n\nMe: I took a picture of the Eiffel Tower at night...\n\n\nLarge Prison Dude: *SHRIEKS LIKE A LITTLE GIRL AND RUNS AWAY IN FEAR AND TERROR*
Well, that's retarded
It’s pretty retarded if you ask me
And small time artists still get their art stolen or reproduced without their consent. Smh
Fuck the cops I’ll snap a picture of whatever I want
Interesting!
Thats soo retarded.

Stop advertising

What the fuck
What about on Madeline?
Blur deez fucking nuts
What has happened to Willian. Hes more of a dancer than a footballer ffs
This has shades of the USMNT. On paper looked like we should tear them a new one but on the pitch got hammered.
I'm going to arsenal TV to get a laugh
Tbh I think Conte is looking to get sacked. He wasn't backed in the transfer window and he misses Italy. We'll probably get Tuchel. Not a huge loss for me tbh, he has no plan b and is too defensive.
Willian is so dreadful it’s not the first game, he has done absolutely nothing this whole season. He best not start on Wednesday, either Pedro or musonda should be given a chance to start.
“How the hell did we make them look like Barcelona. My thoughts exactly. I even tweeted that..
Conte is innocent...understand my beloved cfc fans
looool who else just found this btec arsenalfantv channel
Hopefully Roman sacks Conte the selfish cunt
Hahaha ... :D \nBatsuayi indeed is very mediocre.\nBut let's hope Chelsea could bounce back. Let's support our team instead of mocking them shall we?
Zappacosta should start now that Moses is out injured
Why conte thinks or believes he can go 2 seasons playing one formation still baffles me! This chelsea team is easily predictable because the manager has failed to keep opponents guessing.substituting a striker when u need one and Willian starting games ahead of Pedro!!!!!!
Ppl can't even handle  one bad result. This is the beauty of premier league. Last season conte was magical this & that now suddenly he is this & that. Give some time we don't have proper 11 now due to injuries. Keep calm & support. Dont b glory hunters like man utd , arsenal. We don't have history but we are making in the process. Keep calm. KTBFFH.
Conte is becoming a bitch because he is not like he was at juventus. And if he gets the passion, ruthlessness and desire from juventus we will win the efl cup because we are shit cahill that anus, willian that anus,bastuyai that anus, they don't know how to play willian and bastuyai went from Messi to a Sunday league player. We need to sell them and buy better players but we all know it will never happen because our board is also shit and the fucking owner doesn't take matters in his own hands and sack fire and kick them (board) out of the door.and the last one we need to stop trying to get fouls and man up and aim to get a goal.
what a shit from Willian everytime when he gets the ball he loses it freely why. Batshuayi is another fucked up player being overrated what a shit. every time we start batshuayi and captain its a lose Why. are they committed to the team or they are being paid to fix games. Willian, Cahill and Batshuayi should be benched no matter what those players are fucking useless. Rudiger and Christen are much better on the back than what this old guy is doing for us. \n\nYeah Batshuayi is like a broken condom
Title is over man. Summer transfer was underwhelming coupled with these type of performances. Best we aim for top 4, try to win one of the domestic cup n maybe a decent run in the ucl.
If we can’t beat Crystal Palace and Burnley, what’s the point.
These southern fans need to get a grip imagine if you supported a club that actually struggles.
Batshuayi should just get outta club asap...willian has really been shit of late though...cahill should just be like JT and admit its past his time and settle for a spot on the bench but he is probably selfish thinking of a spot in world cup...i have a feeling this season will be like the season after we won the league two years ago....
We won't win the league for sure bcoz our squad depth is just totally shit.For Man City even without Aguero they are thrashing teams left and right bcoz they have another proven striker Gabriel Jesus.For United if Lukaku gets injured they have Zlatan , Rashford and Martial.But we have useless Batshuay.When he plays we become so shit that we can't even beat fucking Palace!!!!!!
You completely made my day mate. These words are 100% Chelsea now 😡😡
City are light years away from any team in the PL right now. The top 4 is the real competition
i love this guy
Every time Michy gets a chance he absolutely blows it and has a shocker.We need to move Luiz into midfield and play Christiensen while Kante is injured
You spoke the thruth all the way we better fix up or else watford is gone win over us like Arsenal.  No joke start making a transfer list of players we need now NOW AND I MEAN PLAYERS NO BUY TO LOAN OUT FFS
we really need to calm down! these things happen
he talks like Moh from ArsenalFanTV. same talking style
Shades of Arsenal Fan Tv
My man is a London Carlton from fresh prince of bel air
Football is shit ... :D ... Why would you give a fuck about it...
Oh m god this was too funny
Ok so we will just have to go ahead and win the champs league ...again.\n Keep the faith ppl.
Imagine fans who think matic would have helped us through this patch.
Naw, tell us how you really feel.
Win: WE'RE BEST IN THE WORLD. WE WIN THE LEAGUE. WATCH OUT MANCHESTER. \n\nLose: WE'RE SHIT BYE BYE TITLE WHAT A SHIT CLUB. \n\nMove past it. We were the worse team today. We were against Man City. We don't have two first-team-worthy XIs like some other clubs do. I wonder what these people were like during the 15/16 season, and how many ditched their club only to watch them win the next season. \n\nYou win on some days, you lose on others. We can talk about the contributing factors to today's loss or we can act like they aren't there whilst dismissing them as excuses, either way, move on or get left behind.
Totally agree with Lewis we were poor today and I don’t know why. Honestly hope the board and Roman were watching cuz they need to go buy another quality back up 11 for us cuz players are gonna get injured a lot this season for us
If u want to keep hazard, kante , courtios and this kind of result and I'm 100% sure hazard will leave after this season or have same kind owner as psg or city have but it will just get worse you guys
Trending with 9.2k views, well then I guess that Russian tycoon even bribed YouTube mods then.
Exactly mate that was the best thing you have ever said lol, batshuayi needs to fuck off he is worst player in our team and if we can't get another striker in January we atleast have recall Tammy Abraham cause he has been brilliant so far for Swansea.
That brown guy probably celebrated like made when batman scored the winner against athletico, Fucking plastic hypocrite!
Michy didn't have a good game but neither did the whole team, he didn't get any service. WILLIAN is useless he needs to fuck off.
Old and past their prime: Pedro, Fabregas, Cahill, Willian\nAverage: Alonso, Bats, Moses\nDecent: Zappacosta Rudiger\nGood: Luiz Bakayoko Musonda, Christensen, Hazard , Morata, Azpi\nClass: Kante\nThe fact that our team is made up of old washed up players along with average players playing a system that they don't understand proves how we have no chance of top 4 let alone winning any games in the future. A change is what's needed, the board and players have to go and the coach has to change the system but because our team is so stubborn and refuses change of course we will stay like this for the next few years
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Retire the trophy for comment of the season,  Lewis wins for William rant.
Its a wrap 4 us. No title.
Chelsea is as good as a condom with a hole in it 😂😂😂😂😂😭so fucking upset
Well of course he sucks the guy comes from Marseille
i hate these so called chelsea fans let's hope the money runs out we go down to the championship and get the fck rid of these glory hunter fans GET OUT OF HOW CLUB
I think Antonio is doing bad selections to lose games, so he can prove his point to the board for not bringing his transfer targets. I wander does it mean , that CFC will lose every game when Alvaro or Kante are out? Common Antonio. You have enough players to cover. You could have played Luiz in midfield today and leave Christensen in defence. Why on earth play Willian again , after a disaster against MC?
lol forget the title its long gone now, do you honestly think we can even compete with city
talk up the things lewis
Lets just focus on the champions league right now !!!
Basically this video makes me smile bigger than i was crying harder when i watch the cunt cocking game.
i said it we will hear many time that was the worst game we ever seen this season, you need to count how many times you will say it this season lol
what a shit from Willian everytime when he gets the ball he loses it freely why. Batshuayi is another fucked up player being overrated what a shit. every time we start batshuayi and captain its a lose Why. are they committed to the team or they are being paid to fix games. Willian, Cahill and Batshuayi should be benched no matter what those players are fucking useless. Rudiger and Christen are much better on the back than what this old guy is doing for us. \n\nYeah Batshuayi is like a broken condom
Willian\n- First Game: Poor\n- Second Game: Poor.\n- Third Game: Poor\n- Forth Game: Poor\n- On Repeat.\n\nWalker currently has 3 assists. Davies currently has 2 assist and 2 goals. Azpi currently has 3 assists. Moses really needs to fuckoff from the team! He cant even make an ordinary cross! Hes played more than 8 matches this season and this idiot is yet to score a goal or even make an assist. Bloody waste of space! \n\nI bet Alonso will find it difficult to cripple my crippled grandma\n\nWhat a shitty team we have!\n80% of the blame is on Conte.\nI dont give a fuck if you think otherwise.\n\nThank You!
@100PercentChelsea You gotta stop turning into Arsenal Fan TV you cunt.
Conte should switch to a Back4 again\n\n4-4-2 would be great\n\n.......... Courtois ..........\n...Ruediger....Luiz........\nAzpi...................Alonso\n.....................................\n...........Fabregas...........\n...Kante..........Bakayoko\n............Hazard.............\n...Musonda......Morata...\n\nSubs-\nCaballero\nChristensen\nZappacosta\nCahill\nPedro\nWillian\nMoses

Ahh Yes Chelsea tears!!
We only won 2-1 SACK WOY! H

I don't get it. League title has to be going to someone else. We can't drop points to teams like CP. I don't care who's injured.
this guy looks worse than a holed condom he should shut the fuck up plastics
Twat
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Bats man dumb Asf.... Willian & Cahill all the way washed up
Biggest wasteman on d channel
Why so blue guys
Arsenal are losing
Tbh we miss Morata so much

Watford beat Arsenal. We're screwed lol
This team looks even worse than the team in the 15/16 season.
Well if it makes anyone better Arsenal lost to Watford who we face next week.
HEY, watch your mouth about condoms !!!!
Whats gonna happen against roma 🙄
EAGLES!!!!!
This result ruined my mood today I finished work at 330 and thought let's see how we are doing and we were 2-1 down at that point and ending up losing to a team who until today everyone had wiped the floor with
Batshuayi is so shit lmao, the downgrade as a vocal point from Morata is real
Chelsea can forget about retaining their title, they’ll struggle to finish top 4.
Attention Chill customers, refreshments and snacks will be served momentarily... enjoy tonight's entertainment!
CHELSEA UNDER CONTE... NEVER LOST TWO GAMES IN A ROW... AND THAT HAS HAPPENED...
Willian\nCahill\nMichy\nAlonso\n<SHITTTTT >\nBakayoko\nLuiz\nFabregas\nmoses\nPedro \n<AVERAGE>\nChelsea will be lucky to get top 10
I think Conte wants to leave
Fabregas wasn't that bad.  Neither was Bakayoko and Curtois did his best.
Wow, look at us, we’re turning into arsenal fan tv, disgraceful and ungrateful
lewis talks sense
WE FUCKING LOVE BEATING YOU 😂😂😂
Hazard is about as consistent as pigeon shit on Trafalgar Square.
Conte 4th Game 4th wrong Tactic.\nAgainst Burnley Michy starts ahead of Morata , Game Against Arsenal Bakayoko Comes on too late, Game 3 He parks the bus Jose rented him loses against City now Palace Willian starts over Pedro and Musanda, And David Luiz and Cahill still Play Moses is not a Fucking Right Back Zappacosta is , Use him and Alonso must go Fuck off with that murdering Cunt enough of his shit had the Nerve to say i wanna go back to Spain let him Fuck off to Levante or Celta de Vigo.\nConte Out Campaign is on.
plastic fans wanting conte out after he won the league
Sack N'Golo Kante the useless cunt.
plastic club, plastic fans. JOKE CLUB AHHAHAHAHAHAHA
For fucks sake doesnt anyone see the fact Palace were better on the night and do have very good attacking players, fucking fake Chelsea fans, turning into Arsenal Fan Tv!!!!
charley Musonda was fucking poor
Conte out luis enrique in
Do people not listen to his comments at all? It's hilarious. He explains why he did what he did and people just don't listen.
Jose is spot on. I saw the same that Klopp was scared of taking off one of those midfield players cause we would have killed them after that. I think we could have still scored but the passing in our buildup was poor. Good point. We will put them to the sword when they come to the theater of dreams. GGMU
He came for 1 point. At Old Trafford he'll go for 3.
What Garry Neville said is true, for all delusional haters out there go back to your FIFA. Klop made it look like he was offensive and making attacking changes but it was an act. He didn't want to lose this game more than wanted to win it. Utd could have lost the game and it wouldn't have made a big difference not the same for liverfool. Deep down they know that they would have taken a point before the game and a point to utd taste like 3 points. Park the bus my ass if you defend well and play counter that's just a tactic. If you park the bus you don't bring on rashford and lingard. U bring on lindelof, blind. Clueless ppl commenting on football nothing new
Jose Mourinho is a genius.
1st real test, 1st bus parked. You fucking pussy. I'd rather lose than watch that utter shite. Grow a pair
still undefeated for the season hehe
i'm a man.utd fan, but man.utd have so many deluded idiots supporting the club. i remember seeing 0-4, 1-3 type of predictions all over the place.\n\nfor me, i'm pleased with the result, but not with the performance. united have created too little, but conceded quite a lot of chances. these kind of away games are ok. as long as you don't lose them.\n\nsometimes i wonder if there is any good team in europe that jose wouldn't park the buss against... :)\nthe truth is that we have good results so far, but even when united win 4-0, we never look that convincing throughout all 90mins.\n\nagain, i'm pleased with the result, but we cannot win the pl performing against top team like this, we have to improve a lot... GGMU!
BUS WANKER
Tony Pulis with the ability to spend hundreds of millions.
This man and Utd are afraid of big teams confirmed..\n\nOnly picking on small sides and hiding away from the big boys...\n\nLiverpool should have scored their chances.
was anyone seriously surprised? he is too scared to play against big teams away lol park the bus fc
BORRRRRRRING GAME . WORST game this season
Exclusive, Mourinhos tactics leaked:\n\n🚌🚌🚌🚌\n  🚌🚌🚌\n    🚌🚌\n       🚌
Pure shit
Boring 😴
scared of playing against Liverpool what will United do against European tops teams mid week? lmao
Joke of a manager, joke of a club
Mourinho just gonna totally ignore the fact that he had Mata on the bench who could put his foot on the ball and give possession.
lol these reporters are out to wind up Mouringyo
he sends andreas pereira on loan and moans for having no midfield playes on bench.....pereira would have been great value in this squad.
Liverpool only created 1 clear cut chance which was of matip apart from that they were just shooting from long range just like liverpool play shooting from long range and scoring screamers that is why they will never win anything
Liverpool were all over you, \nU prick.
Don’t let this distract you from the fact that Arsenal lost 2-1 to Watford.
He definitely go for a draw.. i can feel jose had a lot of pressure after last season.. he could have been sacked if he didnt win europa league after all the money  he spend.. so now he tried the best to not losing by parking ke train and not sacked by the bus..
People complaining ?? Looks like draw but it's beautiful 1 points, kloop worked on defending I think
One team wanted to win this game, embarrassing it’s hard to break down 11people behind the ball
Chicken-shit manager with chicken-shit scared defensive tactic. Nothing new from arrogant shit. Big game against big opponent and he goes defensive. His explanation is BS. He is a reactive manager. I hope City smashes them 5-0 like Barca did his Real M in 2010.
Man that's an ugly shirt.
Why didn't Mourinho envisage the possibility of the formation that Klopp chose and have a mid-field  player on the bench to deal with it. Isn't that what coaches do especially the Special One? Of course he didn't come for 3 points but just the 1.
Not a bad point considering all the injuries.  Lukaku should have buried that once chance he had.  That would have been classic Mourinho! Overall though I think United midfield and attackers had a really bad game.  Bad touches, bad passes, and Liverpool won most 2nd balls and 50/50s.  They looked like they wanted it more.
Jose Jose jose. Guardiola is playing de bryun and Silva both number 10 in midifield if Jose wants to really control the game he could have payed mata but he didn’t want to take risk. However as a Man U fan I think he did the rit thing by parking the bus. Fergi have done it, so why not Jose ?
PATHETIC EXCUSE BY MOURINHO\n\nHERRERA 30M\nMATIC 30M\n\n2 DM'S HIS CHOICE.\n\nHE HAD MATA ON THE BENCH, HE'S A NEGATIVE PRICK
am so glad this bus parking man get out of my club.
How is 9k views in 6 hours ‘trending’
Played for a point and can't even admit it
How is this on trending?!
LFC there for the taking and he bottled it
Fucking dickhead blaming his midfielders instead of his shite tactics. This man is a coward. Liverpool are shocking defensively, take the initiative and put them to the sword. This is cowardly. He played the same vs Southampton in the second half after going 1-0 up. Coward.
jose,jose, here ,over here, boring as fuck jose,man united charlatans again jose. here jose .millions spent and no joy jose. chelsea what jose, liverpool better .yes that is true. united found out again .
HAVE YOU SEEN CHELSEA LOSING TO CP ? OR ARSENAL TO WATFORD ? HELLO THIS IS REAL FOOTBALL NO ONE CAN CONTROL IT LIKE YOU DO WITH ALEX HUNTER'S JOURNY IN FIFA !
Jose the anti football bus parking cunt. Fucking embarrassing. He is just a glorified Tony pulis.
Mr negative football, the inventor of parking the bus
Man City at the top lol
jose boringho
Man United manager doesn't care what fun say or think .\nThat what I like to morinho .
Everytime Arsenal depresses me, i always remember the mighty united spent 90m on a walking haircut to finish 6th and celebrate a EFL cup.
I'm a big fan of Jose but that performance today was irritating. For me he should've used a 3-5-2. Just no attacking threat today, our momentum has slowed down after the last few games.
Could be worse -- just look at Chelsea
İ am not Liverpool fan but Liverpool was better team
I don't think that Mourinho played for a point but I think he later tried to save a point
Mourinho does not allow big teams to beat his sides. Away from home, all big home teams shall attack, hence mourinho having to counter that. United were away, both teams have champions league in midweek- everybody content with 0-0. Liverpool have to make a show as they are home...
no midfielder ???? who’s fault is that???
really a villain, could do anything to support the cause.
I'm all 'bout that bus, 'bout that bus, no treble
manu lack creative mid fielders
1 point is still 1 point. no pobga no fellaini.
Still fumming LOL, well next week will bring more misery. Klop like what shit did I get myself into, he just went 20 yrs backward when he signed that contract. Now go back to playing fifa and FUCK OFF 20 times 20 times MAN UTD
Calm down guys, Chelsea lost today......

without retracts please !!
👿👿0/0:(
He's waiting for Klopp to make the first move. Such a counter attacking manager against top sides. Even with the absences he had more than enough talent to take the game to them.
FEYENOORD!
Look how city is playing. Learn something moron
Special one👏
Mou is classic.
Mr. Parkinho!
Bus wanker.
Well played Liverpool...shitty United
Shark is waiting to gobble moron mourino.
mourinho has no clue what this game means merseyside v mancs and players we need british players and managers and that goes to liverpool as well.
Listen 1:15-1:55 He Said that he didn't have a lot of Midfielders cm/cmds Only Matic and herrera  thats why he went for a draw\nNext game Guarantee a win
destroy football.....idiot mourinho play football we are mantsester united and you spent 300....what football is that;;;barca real united bayern play attacking fotball..histor...bastard you destroy the team we are not chelsea or inter.....
Liverpool prolly played their best game this season, some idiots just can't comprehend that and always put the blame on Morinho
When you play a quicker team. Start trying playing first more italian. Then play like Barca.
A 0-0 draw with Liverpool means Mourinho has now gone ten straight games without a win at Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham or Saturday’s opponents. His sides have drawn five and lost five of those games, conceding 15 goals and scoring just four times. Just one of those away goals have come since he was appointed at Old Trafford.
DrawchesterUnited😂😂😂😂
What makes me mad is idiots that do not understand how deeply depleted the team is at this period of time, which Mourinho is trying to conceal as much as he can. Get it: no Bailly, no Rojo, no Carrick, no Pogba, no Fellaini and on top of that injured Rashford. Why Mouhrinho played defensively and Lukaku did not get service, because Mouhrinho is realistic, he got the maximum today and Lukaku had his chance to score. That is all Mkhitaryan's fault.
blah,blah MU didn't win bcoz pogba is injured and klopp did not go out full attack! \nmou is a shit manager!
Jose you are talking BS. I have followed United for 28 years, and this is what you give back to our tradition. Sir Alex would never have done that. He would have gone for it, in the best of traditions of United. This is typical Jose play...
GGMU  win lose or draw man united till i die, 20 times Champions!!! many plastic fan's (kids?) 😡😠 If you can't win, draw is good. J.M won more at Man Utd than J.K and P.G at loserpool and SHITY 😂
Klopp has spent 34 Mio overall in 2 years , Mourinho 254 Mio 2 years
this guys full of shit moaning about Jurgen klopp didn't let him win the match lool
Jose should be ashamed of himself today, we played like wba. Second half he went so defensive it was utter crap football. Why not go for it with 20 mins left, is that what Utd are gonna do every time we play a top six away, it's not good enough for man Utd. Sorry but that was embarrassing
1st
Man Utd fan here. I agree with what Mourinho was saying. Watching the game, Liverpool had more possession and pressed higher, but they could not unlock our defense. Both teams were trying to nullify each other's attacks. Liverpool tried to keep the ball and pressing high when they didn't so they get the ball back. Man Utd were defending in numbers to counter-attack Liverpool, which has been a weakness of theirs. Klopp didn't risk removing a midfielder to reinforce their attack, because it meant that a space would form in the middle which would help our devastating counter-attack. He knew if we countered it would be over, so he played it safe. Both teams were defensively strong but Liverpool were poor in attack and we were waiting to attack. \n\nI don't mid the defending in numbers. What frustrated me was the sloppy passes and possession loss when we did have the ball. Our midfielders gave the ball away too much. This is why Pogba is good in counter-attacking. He has the best range of passing arguably in the world and would've been better for possession when we had possession.\n\nNevertheless, coming to Anfield is tough so a point is enough. United will be happier with the point though, especially with Liverpool's shit form. 1 win in 8 games, are you okay?
Meanwhile city keep bangin goals. Thats the diference between Pep and the bus driver.
Klop and jose are far to smart for so called journalists with their negative comments
KLOPP SPENT 120M SINCE OCTOBER 2015\n\n300M SPENT SINCE JULY 2016. HE'S A PATHETIC NEGATIVE FRAUD
BORING BORING UNITED!
All this week José Bus Company was doing his job which was parking bus for a living and that's when he got his tactics from today game. Boring Boring Boring Wankchester United as allways.
Please share your experiences/relationship with alcohol in the comments section below, we'll both be reading them all! xxx
Jessie, your highlighter is distracting me. I couldn't stop staring at it haha
thank you so much girls for talking about such a sensitive subject 💓x
I actually basically don't drink much at all,  when I was younger sure there was a drinking culture when was a teenager in the 80's so its been in OZ for a very long time, I stopped most of my drinking when I had my Kids and Believe it or not lost the taste for alcohol.  I am also a Muso so drinking is pretty standard in my world, however i choose not to drink and don't care what anyone else think.  I also think our drink driving laws in QLD have made a difference to some people as well,  as far as their drinking habits, more people drink before they go out now.   alcohol is expensive and I rather spend my money on other stuff.
Jess your makeup is beautiful. Brings out your natural beauty
i rarely drink but when i do it's small amounts with family around the holidays
I'm 15 in the suburbs near chicago in the U.S. I have never drank. my friends don't want to, and neither do I. some people at my school do have drinking parties and shit like that. It just depends on who you are and who you're friends with. There's 2,600 students at my school, so it makes sense why our culture is so varied.
I only drink to savor the flavors. I've never got drunk before. I love nicely brewed beer, tasty wine.... One of my favorites is umeshu (Japanese plum wine).
We definitely have issues with alcoholism here in America. think part of it is the up bringing. Here in the states you can't drink until you're 21 (legally) so most people do a lot of binge drinking when they're young because they aren't 'taught' to drink they're sneaking it. Then another part is maybe the attitude of work and play... Americans are still pretty concerned with 'the American dream most working crazy long stressful days. So to unwind they maybe have a few at the end of the day. So now you drink to relax and have fun. Happy? Drink. Sad? Drink. It's Tuesday? Bottoms up.
The Portuguese have a very similar culture of drinking. The stereotypes are old drunk farmers.\nIn Canada though, the legal age is 19 and places are STRICT about this. \nMy first drink was when I was 14 and from then on I would drink and get plastered at parties occasionally.\nI grew up in a house where my dad was an alcoholic and because of that, I don't have a very good relationship with alcohol. My mom has been afraid I'll be more inclined to that behaviour. I have a low tolerance and I try to stay away from alcohol when I'm sad or lonely because I don't want to indulge those feelings with something that can really harm me. My friends binge drink a lot and I actually had a discussion with a few of them and it's scary. \nWhat were you parents like about you both drinking?
Why do you drink in the first place if you believe it harms you?
I am from Spain. We start drinking early, my first drink was when I was 13. I have drank a lot in my life, I am 30 now, but this year I have started to quit. I would have maybe two or three beers when I go out but that's it. I can't deal with the shame, the anxiety and the hungover anymore. But the pressure even from friends is huge.
I started drinking just before I was 16 and that was 100% my choice. Like a lot of people have said in Australia we have such a similar situation with alcohol where there are 15 year olds getting drunk and tbh it’s not right in a way but it all comes down to the person, if they want to get drunk at 15 they can have that choice to do it
Not even on my 21st birthday did I drink. I've never had alcohol and don't really plan to. I'm just not interested. What bothers me is how people react when you simply don't drink. Its like people need a reason as to why you don't. I remember going to a bonfire when I was 18 with my new college classmates. One of the girls I was hanging out with asked me if I wanted a drink. I told her no, I didnt drink. When she asked why, I told her, My uncle had liver failure when I was 15. It put me off alcohol. She said she respected that but proceeded to go on about how she thought people that don't drink for no reason are f***ing losers. My uncle did have liver failure but I hate that I feel compelled to use that to get people to leave me alone about alcohol. Alcohol is a personal choice. Drink if you want to, don't drink if you don't want to. Lets respect everyone's choice :) love this series. Love you Mel. Love you Jess 💚💚💚
I'm from Germany and I started drinking and binge drinking with 14. I don't know why, I think I just wanted to distract myself from my problems. I am 16 now and I actually don't drink that much anymore but I still can't control myself when it comes to drugs. I wish people would talk more openly about drug abuse instead of romanticizing it
I just saw this vid and its funny because i have been hanging all day because last night I went to a party and normally im not that bad drunk but i was sloppy and kissing people i shouldn't have and alcohol is such a depressant for me and raises anxiety so much that i was crying in a car park for over an hour... but i kind of know my limit but all my friends were drinking loads so i did and its so unhealthy :(
Both looks so good in this!! The natural makeup looks so amazing on Jess!😍
I rarely ever drink only on occasions. I like being in control of myself haha I get drunk so easily too 😂😂
Thank you for talking about this, my mom passed away this year due to an alcohol addiction so I've never really had a good relationship with alcohol. I've done all the things you've said; been out binge drinking then not remembering then things I'd done then next day. Moms addiction made me see alcohol in a different light, it went on for over ten years and destroyed her life. It can be so dangerous! I would never tell people not to drink as I still drink every now and then (not currently cos I'm pregnant!) but my eyes are so open to the dangers xoxo
I'm an Irish 22 year old and I've never had a drop of alcohol and I don't plan to. I hate it when I meet people on a night out and they ask what I'm drinking and I say a coke or something they automatically assume that either A) I'm pregnant (which I'm not) or B) that I used to have a drinking problem (which I haven't). When I tell them that I've never had alcohol they all go Fair play to ya or they look at me like I've got ten heads! Last year I was out with my older brother and his friends at his birthday party in a pub/nightclub in Dublin and when I told when of his friends that I don't drink he literally started to question me for the next 45 MINUTES! He was in shock that I never had some cider down the park when I was younger. Also, as a student living away from home for the first time in a different city, I find that I'm not invited out with my friends from college because they automatically assume that I don't like pubs or clubbing. I'm half Irish, half English I LOVE going down to the pub and having the laugh with my friends! Just because I don't drink doesn't mean that I don't like going out with friends on a night out. I find it really sad that we have such a big alcohol problem in Ireland and no, neither of my parents are alcoholics. The reason why I choose not to drink is A) It's WAAAY to expensive! I'm a broke ass college student! B) I don't need it to have fun. Also I'd like to say that no, I don't shame my friends for drinking or anything like that. If they want to drink, let them drink! Rant over.
When I was younger I thought the German drinking culture was bad...then I spend some time at a British Uni and now I think differently. I know people who sometimes get quite drunk, but not too many. I rarely drink. When I do it is usually a drink or two at a bar with friends, very rarely I get a bit tipsy before going out. I like the taste of some alcoholic beverages, especially cocktails, but I also get a bit sick of the taste quite quickly, so drinking a lot wouldn't be easy for me anyway. I also never felt the need to. Most of my good friends don't drink that much and even if I am at a party where people are drinking, I just stop when I feel like I don't want to drink anymore. It is sad that you then sometimes have to justify yourself for not drinking. I also find it shocking when I hear people as young as 18 say that it would be a challenge for them to abstain from drinking for a month. I really have nothing against a bit of social drinking, but I find it disconcerting how something as harmful as alcohol plays such a big role in society.
I live in portugal (which is in the top 20 countries with the most alcohol consumption; legal drinking age - 18)  and I am 16. I can't even count how many times I've gotten  like really fucking drunk. Around my circles of friends it's pretty normal. I've bought alcohol as a 15 year old. It is not allowed but I did it in a self-service place and loads of more local/small shops sell you if you don't look too young, without carding ya. My father incourages me to drink (not the way I do), but since I was little he'd let me drink from his glass. I don't think that had to do with how I came to drink more heavily but idk just thought i'd share that. It´s not just drinking, I don't think I've gone to a party where there wasn't any weed and some other shit. Everytime we're going out it's always with the minset of like let's get fucked. BUT besides that I don't really drink by myself, I don't really feel the need to. And I've never got drunk to solve any problems, it's always been in good fun, I guess. Plus I somehow have never gotten a bad hangover and haven't had any too bad experiences with it, so it has never been a problem for me. the worst that's happened was not enjoying the party cause I was passed out. \n(We mostly drink vodka but anything will do really, also alcohol is really cheap  €6 for a bottle of vodka black for example.)
Theres no pressure to drink here in Cyprus but everyone 13+ does it anw because drinks are so easy to buy, no one asks for an ID, they just ask for your age SOMETIMES (and you can say the truth and even then not really care) and when you're out whether it be a normal weekend outing or a party everyone has a drink on them anw. Theres no reason why u cant is what im saying.
New Zealand has a similar issue with a v strong youth binge drinking problem, as well as social drinking being so common place. It's normal now to go out into town (in akl and wellington at least) and see teens absolutely smashed and staggering about. Also seeing how dependent people can be on it, has definitely made me aware of the dangers, and i make a concerted effort to not drink everytime i go out, like opting for a L/L/B instead! Solid video!! :))
New Zealand has a real bad binge drinking culture, there is also a lot of pressure to be drinking, especially in your teens and twenties
Here in Australia we have a pretty big drinking culture, its not uncommon for young people to go out a few times per week.  I used to go out all the time but I found that it doesn't make me feel good and I end up wasting a lot of money on a night out.  For a little while I did prioritize going out over university which is obviously not the smartest thing in the world.  So now I try not to go out as often and save it for birthdays and other celebrations which I find makes it more enjoyable rather than going out every weekend.
My dad was a serious alcoholic until the day he died, my brother is an alcoholic (but won't admit it) and my abusive ex was a heavy drinker. So I don't have a good relationship with it and have always hated how society and Australian culture portrays alcohol. I used to drink socially anyway cause I felt so pressured to (I started at 14! Stopped drinking very much after 22 though), but I have stopped drinking altogether for health reasons. It was the best decision for me. Although now I feel so left out, especially as a young queer person, all of the social things for queers surround drinking culture (clubbing, bars, pub nights, etc). I'd be interested to hear you talk about the drinking culture within the queer community, Melanie. Thanks for the great video ladies :)
I’m in Spain studying abroad right now and the coordinators of my program have been telling us that Spanish people frequently drink but you never see them drunk because binge drinking is seen as quite immature. It makes me kind of embarrassed seeing some of the other Americans in my group going out and getting wasted and looking forward to doing it again and again. But to each their own I guess
I was never interested in drinking during my teens. My friends drank, but I didn't like the idea of losing control of my own actions and potentially hurting someone. I also don't think I genuinely trusted them enough - they were so obsessed with the idea of getting the 'sober one' drunk, I wonder what they would've done if I had got drunk with them. I didn't really start drinking until first/second year of uni. I think that was because I finally trusted my friends. I knew that if I got smashed (which rarely happens tbh) they would keep me safe and take me home, and I would do the same for them. Even after that, I very rarely went out and hardly ever got smashed, but I did drink. Now I've just graduated uni and I'm training to teach, so I don't have the time to drink anymore :')
I never drank and I do go out. I see what alcohol does and I really don't want to experience it. What really really bothers me though is how pressing people can be for you to drink when you've been telling them for years that you don't drink. It's very annoying, disrespectful. If you're one of the Come on, you're no fun, have one little glass... Stop, really it feels very isolating
I'm 18 from Sabah which is part of Malaysia (it's a Muslim country) but in my hometown people don't rlly bother about that and usually start drinking around the age of 15-16 and they start going to clubs around that age too (at least for the people in my school which was a private school) I used to drink sooooooo much when I was younger and whenever I got drunk I did the weirdest things haha but one time I drank until I threw up and it was horrible so that put me off drinking like now whenever I even smell alcohol it makes me wanna vomit
I'm Irish and never drank untill I was 21, but even now I have never been drunk I just enjoy the occasional few 😊
I’m 16 and I’ve never drunk, not because I’m against it or never had the chance; just because I’ve just never felt like it. I feel an increasing amount of pressure from my peers to drink, I just don’t think I’m ready yet.
New Zealand 'apparently' has the worst drinking culture in the world.\n So over here drink is like $12 a glass of beer on a night out which is about half the price of a meal. Another reason is because pre mix drinks (that my English friends say taste like lolly water) are being made readily available by their parents. I don't drink a lot as i find it boring to do as i rather play Fifa 18 or chill with my mates.
New Zealand (my country) has a horrible binge drinking problem, much like Ireland. Similar to you two, I had my first drink when I was 16 going on 17, but at that point I was already late to the game; people here often start drinking at 14 or 13. I'm in a group that thankfully doesn't drink a lot, so I've never really felt the pressure to need to drink, but I've seen it happen to other people and it can be pretty nasty the pressure to drink until you vomit or blackout. It's interesting when you consider the reasons binge-drinking really started in NZ was that the government wanted to cut back drinking issues (temperance in the 1890s) so the time pubs shut was put forwards, so instead of drinking less they drank more in a shorter space of time, and when the time restraint was lifted the binge-drinking culture had already stuck.
I'm 19 and Irish and I don't drink, nor have I ever. When all my friends started drink at about 16/17 it made me so so anxious and panicked, I didn't like hanging out with them if they were drinking and it was a serious issue for me. I hated the idea of how damaging them drinking was to themselves and sneaking around behind parents backs. It was always thought to me when I was younger that alcohol is bad and from  seeing what it does to people I just was never comfortable with it. My favorite teacher once made a comment that if alcohol was founded today it would be illegal because it basically is a drug. Over the years I've gotten more comfortable with drink around me but if I'm honest it can still make me panicked sometimes, like if someone drunk was to come up with me acting so unusual to how they normally do I would get incredibly uncomfortable. Part of me wishes I did drink and that I liked it because although they say you don't have to drink to go out and have a good time I haven't found that to be the case yet. I don't go out that often but when I do I never really enjoy myself, I prefer to hang out in a friend's house than go to a club or bar which is really difficult when I have just started college and ever Thursday being bombarded with the are you going out? Aw why not? questions and having to make excuses. I'm hoping that over time I'll find away to be part of going out and manage to enjoy myself...
I think that a lot of drinking culture can come from a countries history. When there have been real low points and society has struggled people turn to drink and I think it can stick.
I don’t rlly drink I’ve had a few at party’s but I’m only 15 I don’t know how I feel about it but I don’t rlly want to get drunk x
I quit drinking almost a year ago. Even when drinking a little I felt like it was impactingen my depression and anxiety in a bad way. It shifted a lot. My sexual behaviour, social life, my mental health everything is changing still. It is hard sometimes but I've grown soo much, I'm not going back any time soon.
I didn't start drinking until I was 19 due to both my parents having somewhat unhealthy relationships with alcohol as I was growing up, and I think I'm glad I waited. I'm from the US but studied at a uni in the UK for a year and also worked in a pub after and personally enjoyed the binge drinking culture. Not that I think it's positive overall, but for me I knew I didn't like the idea of drinking everyday and letting it become habitual, but having one night every couple of weeks when my friends and I would get kinda messy was actually really cathartic for me (I can be pretty anxious otherwise) and there were only a few times that I ever regretted it. Fortunately I'v never turned to alcohol as an escape, and I can see how those habits plus a heavy drinking culture can be a harmful combo. Now I'm back in the US I very rarely drink. I feel there's much more judgement around it here, like people are quick to hand you a beer but also quick to tell you that you're too drunk and should be ashamed a few hours later (not so much from personal experience as observations of others). Plus you have to drive everywhere, and I'm small enough that even one strong drink could put me over, which really limits options for social drinking.
Where is Jessie's top from? It is absolutely adorable !💛
The reason why these bad things happen when you drink alcohol, is because it's a warning, God doesn't want you to drink it! Well why did He create it then? To test you, what do you love more? Him or the demon drink?
I rarely drink, but I usually only have fun and am in control of myself at all times so I think I'm okay :-) However in my teens I think I really had a problem... In school, I remember all I could think of was the next party and the next time I would get to drink... It was bad, and also dangerous! I'm glad I met someone who hated drinking at the time. They distracted me away from it. I'm very thankful about that :-)
Tbh, I think in Spain we have a very close drinking culture and we definitely binge drink while being young. Like you said, alcohol here it's quite cheap and accesible and it's common for very young people to start drinking and even binge drinking. Also since we party until so late in the morning, i feel like we drink more to stay high all night and it can get pretty unhealthy easily. I feel like a lot of us can't party without drinking (or withouth getting drunk) and it's a bit dangerous.
I sort of disagree with what you were saying about spanish drinking culture, amongst teenagers at least, it's really bad. I am a teenager in southern spain. The alcohol is so cheap and basically everywhere will serve people who are very underage. I have been served since I was 13 years old in shops,pubs, clubs etc. I know lots of teenagers who have issues with drinking. Including myself, I had a terrible year when I was just 15 where I was binge drinking heavily and I wouldn't remember any of the stupid terrible things I had done. I have noticed though that it is mostly us foreign kids, British, Russian, American etc who have the issues and not the spanish which is interesting... People here as young as twelve go out drinking and when it gets to the age of about 14/15 everyone in the year group starts going out, it's ridiculous honestly.
I'm Dutch, 23 years old. I've never had a bad relationship with alcohol, but I know teenagers are still drinking up to a point that they get into a coma. Some real alcohol-poisoning...\nI myself rarely drink and when I drink, I don't drink a lot. I drink because I like the taste of some alcoholic drinks, not to get drunk or tipsy. I usually drink no more than about 4 glasses of alcohol on an evening and I like to mix it up with regular drinks in between.
I don't drink alcohol at all these days - less than one drink a week. I had to stop completely two years ago (back injury - painkillers that react badly with alcohol) - but even back at university, I tended not to drink much normally. There was the occasional night of heavy drinking, of course, and a night or two I regret now, but I don't think I'll ever drink that way again.
I'm 17 and from Greece, although I was born in England and have also lived in Ireland and in my opinion what contributes to all this binge drinking in the U.K. and Ireland is the taboo that surrounds alcohol and peoples attitudes towards it. Like, in Mediterranean countries alcohol really isn't a big deal and children are exposed to it from a young age, usually through their parents/grandparents. My parents always let me taste their drinks and we talked open.y about drinking and so now, most of my friends and cousins who come from similar backgrounds mainly just have a drink or two when we go out to bars and get maybe tipsy at parties, just bc they like the taste (I don't drink). Also where I live now, in Cyprus, he drinking age is 17 but anyone at any age can pretty much buy alcohol and be served at bars and it's not an issue and I think that's a good thing bc teenagers will drink anyway might as well do it responsibly and in a chill way
Jessica looks so much like Amanda Peet in Something's Gotta Give. If you look up that movie and see pics of Amanda Peet in it let me know if you agree lol
I’m from Slovakia, alcohol is very cheap around here and almost everybody drinks so so much. It’s just normal. Nobody thinks it’s unhealthy and I just don’t like it. We shouldn’t have this as a norm.\nSaying that I do/did have an unhealthy relationships with alcohol. I started very young around 11/12 and I was binge drinking cheap hard liquor few times a week to run away from depression than I thankfully got treated and got drunk only once in a while in parties and the I stopped all together for a while. Now I only drink wine most of the time, i’ll have a glass with dinner or get tipsy but that’s it. Saying that I know I’m lot more sociable person when drinking and that’s why I often drink when in uncomfortable situations. I get a lot more friendly, happy and communicative..
I drink but only occasionally and when I do it's in a chill environment at my house or with my friends eating a meal. The last time i drank was about 3 weeks ago and before then maybe a month. I'm also quite a lightweight so the most I'll ever drink is 2. Another reason I don't drink often is mostly because of price so when I buy myself alcohol it's easier to get whatever wine I like at the grocery store that's on discount. however, when I've traveled to other countries I drank more often because it was part of the culture and much more chill and normalized than here in the states.
From England (but Irish family) and my bad years were 15/16 maybe 18 but now I never drink. 21 and have not been drunk in years!
Thank you so much for this video Mel. Looking back, when I was 17/18 I had such an awful relationship with drink. I'm only after realizing that after watching this video. For me, it was because of a bad break up aswell. I just had it in my head that I needed to go out and get locked and have 'fun' to make it seem like I wasn't hurting. I didn't want to come across weak so I wouldn't miss a single party. I would drink a 70cl (nearly a liter) of Lidl vodka at house parties and I got alcohol poisoning a couple of times. I would also mix this with taking drugs/smoking weed. It was so unhealthy and like the girls, I put myself in some extremely dangerous situations. Today, I still love a drink but do it very rarely, once every couple months probably, and stay far away from drugs. I'll never go back to that place, it was an awful time and really enhanced the symptoms of depression and anxiety I was feeling at the time. If alcohol wasn't such a huge part of Irish culture, I would probably give it up all together.
i think the drinking culture in england is much the same--especially at university age. i basically don't drink at all, i don't like the taste of it and i rarely feel safe drinking it in a party situation. but i don't think i'd be wrong when i say the majority of university students have a drinking problem. i've watched people move in first year, acting like childish sixth formers, going out every. single. night. and come year three, they're still doing the exact same thing, and surviving on no sleep so they can still pass their classes. i genuinely think a lot of people our age feel like to have a good time you need to drink, not just drink, but do it to excess. it's literally all they talk about. and people are so cruel and pressurising about it--myself and my flatmates were having a game night where we played cards, had a small amount of alcohol each but not drunk, and had a laugh. a friend of theirs dropped by, and they introduced a debilitating drinking game which meant consuming an ungodly amount as quickly as possible, and i felt so uncomfortable. i remember saying 'i'm just gonna drink water' for the challenge of 'downing your whole glass if you lose this round' kinda deal. their response was 'no you HAVE to drink'.... of course i didn't cus fuck that, but see what i mean? it kinda destroyed the night for me and became quite depressing living in constant fear that i might intake too much. if the behaviour of young students in britain were seen in middle aged adults, it would no doubt be alcoholism, so why is it so passable when we're young when it negatively affects you just as much?
I live in Portugal and the drinking culture is quite different from Ireland. I would say most people drink, but few binge drink. Most adults have one or two glasses of wine or beer at dinner but no more than that, maybe a gin or whiskey in a speacial occasion. For us teens though, it's so easy to get alcoholic drinks, almost everyone from 14 up does it. Bars sell drinks to anyone, no IDs requested, no question asked. So a lot of us start drinking early and at 17/18, you're an exception if you haven't already been drunk/binge drink.
The legal drinking age where I live is 14 with parental supervision and 16 for everything expect liquors. I started drinking when I was 15 but that was just on some parties and I didn't drink much. I rarely drink at all now just when I go out with friends I'll have a few drinks but in my friend group it isn't common to drink a lot so we can also just go out and not drink anything. Also I feel it when I start getting tipsy and then I'll just stop drinking and drink some water...
I'm 26 and I moved to England three years ago. I'm from France and before moving here, I had never touched a drink, never. I started drinking here as I felt completely out of place when going out with people. Over time though, I didn't feel pressured anymore however I would keep binge drinking because I just can't face the idea of socialising sober. I got very drunk last night not because I enjoy it but because I'm way too anxious to be around people without it. I don't find it fun to poison myself but I have to if I don't want to stay isolated at home.
I am a 19 year old Irish person and I don't drink; I am the only person that I know of my age that doesn't  (except one friend for healthy reasons, she can't). Primarily because of the fear of it leading to alcoholism because that is such a strong feature in Irish culture and in my family in particular, so I have avoided it. I also have just never been that interested in it and have always seen only the bad from it and heard bad about it from people who continuously drink heavily. I feel I don't need it either though because I experience that feeling of a buzz just from the energy of others like ye were talking about, I get in the spirit of drunk but feel that I do not need alcohol to assist me to get there.
Its ridiculous the drinking culture in ireland, but im studying in denmark at the moment and its similar here!! But i do think its also a student thing, so much pressure to drink every week. Also id be the same, wouldnt see the point in having only one drink, just so used to just drinking to get drunk which i think is the same for a lot of people in ireland, the goal is to get so drunk
I agree!! I tend to drink one or two because I enjoy it, I feel like it otherwise upsets my stomach and my mood... But I've grown up with people *striving* to drink so much that they wouldn't remember what happend the next day. Friends of my mine have gone on the pill just so they wouldn't (hopefully) get pregnant, when drunk and out of control.\nAnd like, I don't wanna separate myself from that thinking, I've really considered it, especially when you're not feeling so great about yourself. People will think you're weird for not finishing the 10 wodka bottles with them...\nAwesome video, lovelies!! <3
Australia is similar to you guys... big binge drinking culture and legal age starts at 18. I started drinking at 13, not all the time but whenever we could sneak it. And I used it very destructively, to get 'wasted' and I'm similar to you Melanie - I can't even fathom some of the dangerous situations I put myself in, and the absolutely STUPID things I've done. I started drinking heaving again during uni. In hindsight, I now realise my depressive moods and awful stuck feelings came from alcohol! I moved from the city to the country to have a break and get on track, because drinking was hard to stay away from. But I love a red wine with dinner and a Bailey's with my Mum. I do recognise it as a poison - I've never been an alcoholic, but I've definitely just been a sheep and done what everyone around me was doing. I'm keen to keep it for very special occasions :)\n\nThanks for sharing, you're both so beautiful and hilarious! X
In Austria we have a similar situation as well, just that in other countries we're not KNOWN for drinking heavily. I like to call it societal alcoholism
I think this is a really great video to get people talking about the risks involved with alcohol use. I work in alcohol research and my one piece of feedback would be to try to stay away from the term alcoholic. Just like anybody with any sort of disability, disorder, etc., you don't want to define a person by one aspect of who they are (e.g., schizophrenic). So in the field we would say people with alcohol use disorder but really you could say anything where you focus on a person being a person first, and then you could use other terms to describe their behaviors (e.g., people who struggle with alcohol, or with my previous example you would say people with schizophrenia).
i've actually been thinking about going sober recently but i'm from the central belt of scotland and the drinking culture is making that quite difficult to do. it's annoying because drinking is so intertwined with socialising and having fun here that, if you don't drink, you're made to feel like you're ruining everyone else's fun. and if you want to go out with your friends on a saturday night, the only options you really have are bars, pubs and clubs, which i find really frustrating. it makes me really hopeful for the creation of social spaces not fully centred around alcohol, but i know that that sort of thing really isn't likely.
i personally never drink. alcoholism is in my genetics from both my parents and some other family members, so i always figured why rock the boat, especially when it was never something that appealed to me anyway.
If you ever come to Wisconsin in the US, our drinking culture is similar to Ireland as lots of Irish settled here. People pride themselves on the fact that we are known as the drinking state.
Laws are different here in Brazil. The some stores don't check if you are over 18 and you can buy alcohol at anytime as long the stores stays open so its easy to anyone access it. Personally I like to drink in parties and social meetings cause I am very shy and vodka makes me chatty. So far I haven't had any trouble or incident, I also never drank to the point I couldn't walk or talk, I always try to keep it light.
well, I'm from america and am not old enough to drink. But both my parents are alcoholics so I have a pretty bad and scaring experience with it. But thats my story.
Ireland is a fun loving country i love the Irish but the stereotype that all Irish are pissheads isn't true it's just the celtic genes in us the welsh and Scottish have the same problem we all just love a drink that's why it's always a laugh when the celtic nations have a night out together
I'm 23 and when I was 18 and started college I socially drank. As time wore on and friends came and went I had a bad bout of binging when I turned 21 and then felt the need to drink when I went out. Now I have a drink now and then and enjoy being sober/ buzzed off of the people around me. My drink of choice is a gin and tonic with extra lime. It's just so darn refreshing.
In the states, the legal age is 21. I feel like because it's so high, we have a weird relationship with alcohol. It probably depends on what part of the country you're from, but I know so many people who start drinking like crazy when they turned 21 because they had to wait for so long. I personally didn't have my first drink until I was 19 😂
My first drink was a beer and I was 16 (so last year), and the I remember feeling like crap the next morning. So, either the beer was weird, or I cannot digest beer. Also, I come from a family that is pretty strict about alcohol, so my parents do not drink. I think coming from that mindset, I had a huge fear of it, and I thought it was immoral to drink any, but I'm realizing with time that it's not true and that it's okay to drink once in a while and to be responsible about. The problem with my parents however still remains...
I’m Canadian and I never would drink before, never wanted to, never even considered it. I was so afraid of not being in control of my faculties and doing or saying something embarrassing. Now I’m nearly 30 and I’ve loosened the straight jacket a little and I’ve tried a few different alcoholic beverages on certain occasions just to see which ones I might enjoy. I haven’t felt any different drinking them... maybe it’s because I only had so much, maybe it’s just that my body doesn’t respond to most things (medications, caffeine, etc). Honestly it’s just not really in the budget anyway, and probably wouldn’t help my chronic conditions... but on occasion if offered a glass of wine or something, I’d like the option and I’d like to feel like I have some sense of what I like and don’t like.
I never started drinking because I never cared too. I kind of looked down on my peers when I was a kid because they were all so obsessed with the idea of it. I've always thought of people who constantly need a drink or need a smoke or need their coffee as weak and contemptible. I think most of the kids I went to school with started drinking when they were 12 or 13. It's pretty fucked up now that I think about it. I almost certainly will never start drinking because I remember the absolutely shameful behavior of my own mother and my cousin (who I used to respect) when they got drunk.\n\nSometimes the topic comes up and someone will ask me if I drink or when I started drinking or something of that nature. When I tell them I don't they always say that they either respect me for it, or that they wish they didn't drink. I always call them out on that bullshit, because not only is it a fact that there is nothing to stop them from pursuing their dream of not drinking (these are people who are not, as far as I could tell, alcoholics), so you would expect that they would have by the time they are adults, but tone of voice speaks much louder than the words they are saying.\n\nAlso I can't get over how hot your sister is. Damn!
I'm 17 and I don't drink at all, I've never tried alcohol and I don't have any interest to do so. And I live in Russia and it's also a problem here, a lot of teenagers drink alcohol here and I think it's really not a good thing. Also my dad is an alcoholic(thankfully I don't live with him) and I really hate seeing him, he's not a good person in the first place but when he's drunk he's even worse.
18 and I'm the only one from the mates who doesn't drink and doesn't intend to anytime soon. Red bulls on nights out it is
I'm 15 and have never had any alcohol (other than a glass of prosecco sometimes at family dinners), and have been in quite a few situations where most people are drinking but me. As I have a lot of friends who are older than me (around 18-20), I am generally one of the only ones who is sober. I don't mind not being drunk but I do feel a bit left out, although I've never really had the urge to drink.
in sweden binge drinking is also prevalent. like, we don't drink during the week but then on the weekends and holidays p much everyone drinks. the socialising culture is centered around drinking much, but at least it is a bit more restrictive in stores and like i started drinking at 16 and i think that's pretty common.
Great video by the way. Generally hearing about hangovers reminds me of shitty times but this video was spot on. Keep it up!
When I started drinking I drank very little but when I got 16 it became really bad because I had problems and started binge drinking to forget about them and even if I still had a hangover I couldn`t wait till the next party. \nI did some really stupid and dangerous things while drunk because I didn´t care about anything anymore, like walking on the quay wall and jumping out of a window or stuff like that and I got drunk because I really desperately needed to talk to somebody about my problems but couldn´t do so sober. I always drank on an empty stomach like not haven eaten for 12 hours (I ate very little at that time because I was really down). One time at a party I got really really drunk to the point where I was nearly unconscious and they had to call my parents because it was so bad and I didn´t even recognise my own father. On the next day I didn´t even have a hangover because I puked everything out that was in my stomach. \nBut I had a total blackout and could only remember little bits from a certain point on. \nSince then I have been drunk a few times but I don´t drink as often anymore, mostly because I don´t want my friends to have to look after me when I get really depressed and do stupid shit or when I puke and stuff.  I hope I wont get that bad again but at the moment things aren´t really going too well, so I´ll see, but I´ve learned a few things since then.\nI also always get really depressed the day after.\n\nIn Switzerland you can buy beer etc. when you´re 16 and vodka etc. when you´re 18, but of course most people drink the heavier things before they´re 18.\nBinge drinking is also quite common here but it´s also common to just get a bit tipsy or not even that, it really depends on the occasion. In my city it´s also very common to smoke weed. There´s a quay where all the pubs and bars are and if you get there you can always smell the weed XD. It´s not that everyone smokes weed, but a lot of people do it and they don´t really hide it that much (even though it´s illegal). I know people who have an alcohol problem but I also know people who have a problem with weed (like 3 joints a day, which is just too much regularly).\nI think that most people here are generally quite tolerant if someone doesn´t drink but of course there´s still a lot of people who will make stupid comments etc.\n\nI forgot about fairs where after a certain time just everybody is completely smashed. (also about 40ish/50ish adults)
There's 13/12 year olds in my school getting drunk  at party's and drinking in school and I always get weird stares when I get offered a drink and I say no cause I don't want to drink yet X
I'm Spanish and people start drinking also at very young ages and without any control. But once you're an adult I'd say they usually just drink some beers or wine (or whatever) whenever you feel like it?\nI started drinking when I was almost 18 and that's really weird. I wouldn't really go to clubs or anything bc being there from 1 am to 8 am and sober wasn't ideal... At the beginning I just couldn't understand why anyone would drink, but I feel like in the end it was just to make me feel special. And nowadays I drink when I feel like having a beer or when my friends and I meet to have a coffee or so in the evening. I guess I'm just lucky I don't wanna spend my money in alcohol, I hate spirits and I don't enjoy clubs. \nI wouldn't say I've had a problem with alcohol, but when one of my exboyfriends broke up with me (without telling me a clear answer) and his grandma and father died of cancer I went a bit wild. Once I even went to the cemetery to drink and draw... But all I did was really sporadic and just my way to seek for attention and try to keep myself busy. \n\n\nAnd yeah, they say in the northern countries people drink so much more, and that in the south we have more prostitution... 🤷🏿‍♀️\n\n\n\n\n\nPS: Beer's amazing. Especially Belgian beer.
Hi :) I'm from belfast,  started drinking at 13/14 a lot, but when I hit 18 I had no interest in it at all, now at 24 I don't drink, maybe the odd cocktail on holidays but that's it! Completely Agree the culture here is crazy!
So glad I can across this video. I've had a bad year with alcohol and it also kicked off with relationships ending. If I have a bad day or feel stressed I do turn to wine and often don't know when to stop. I'll have a glass of wine and then want another, and another and cannot tell what is too much. I also have the same bad relationship with pizza, on bad days I want to buy pizza and have wine but just because I think I will feel better. This video has made me so much more aware of my alcohol consumption and why I turn to drink. Loved this video and you guys are awesome
Watching this before a night out😂
never drank alcohol and don't plan to especially after seen my dad drunk
I'm German :) And we can buy beer with 16 and the hard stuff with 18. Now I know a lot of teens start with 14/15 when they are hanging out with their friends. Some just drink beer while they hang out, some choose like harder stuff. It really depends. For me, I HATED alcohol up until I was 17 I think and I've never really drank I guess. Now, 21, I do drink, a might get drunk here and there but in a moderate manner. But I am a lightweight so I do have to be really careful with the 'let's have a bottle of beer or a glass of wine while we talk'. But yeah. When we have social gatherings we usually pop a few bottles of beer :)
I’m pretty much the same, I’m only into social drinking and I hate drinking at home alone or having alcohol in my house because it basically encourages you to drink it, i started drinking at 17 at my friends 18th birthday but I was pioneer before hand, clearly not a very good one after that 😂
My brother is an alcoholic .when we speak I can hear the hurt and pain . . It has ruin his life. I love good  margarita .
Ah well idk what part of Spain you went to but binge drinking culture is probably even worse here than it is in Ireland. Most pubs will let <16 yo in as long as they're not v full and engagibg in binge drinking literally in the middle of the street or at a park is something most teens to twenty somethings do on a weekly basis. I don't know about drinks being cheap everywhere though, but they certainly are if you live at some kind of college city. However I would say most people just kind of get tired of it by the time they're like 25? Maybe because we start so young (13 I would say?) that it just gets old after a while
Legal drinking age in Germany starts at 14 for beer, champagne and wine with parental permission.\n16 and up: beer, champagne and wine without parental permission.\n18 and up: all other alcoholic beverages (without parental permission of course)\nOur laws are designed to teach kids and teenagers a healthy approach to alcohol and it works according to the statistics :)\nI started drinking when I was 14 and never had a bad relationship with alcohol. Coming from a small village, I drink quite frequently but alcohol abuse is very uncommon between my friends because we learned from the beginning what influences our body and mind in which way. xx
I find alcohol such a tricky one because I personally can always choose to stop or not drink so I would never say I'd had a problem with it, but, I just love drinking? 😂 especially at uni (I'm in 3rd year) there's just opportunities to binge drink with friends every other bloody night and obviously, it's so unhealthy, but just no one questions it because everyone's getting drunk 3/4 times a week
If you are interested on the differences between Northern European and Mediterranean drinking cultures, you should read 'Social and Cultural Aspects of Drinking' by the Social Issues Research Centre (1998). I wrote an essay on the topic and it is super interesting! Greetings from a Spaniard in England x
I did the bulk of my drinking when I was 15. I would have only a couple of drinks then I would turn into a completely different person. Violent. Angry. The worst part was I couldn’t remember anything I had done past the first few drinks. I made the decision aged 16 not to drink anymore. I’m now 24 and haven’t touched a drop since making that decision. I’m from Wiltshire in the UK.
I'm from Australia where the drinking culture is very similar to Ireland
Jessie is so good at makeup im always shook HER FACE BEAT IS FLAWLESS
I was a problem drinker once upon a time. I stopped 40 years ago and haven't touched a drop since. What came with stopping, was being ostracized from the group of friends I had. In small town America (where I'm from) if you don't drink, and run the bars, you have virtually no social circle to join. IF you aren't into the church scene, then there is no scene to be in without alcohol. That being said, dropping the booze was the single best decision I ever made for me.Albeit a bit more difficult life though.

💚💚💚
im ashamed for him. this is hard to watch.
Draws a line in the sand to his fans huh?    His dwindling fan base that is lol.   This is just sad to me.   If this guy from white, middle class 10 Mile Rd. (not a run down trailer park on 8 Mile Rd.) is such a good freestyler, why did it take him 10 months to serve his globalist masters and go after Trump?
What a pile of shit
Ya Trump no Balls , Yet everyone scared sh@%t he goin to drop bombs . You swear so cool , now don't be scared .
Eminem what a tool. Glad I deleted all my pirated Eminem music a long time ago.
sucks to be a trump sucker now.
Trump is a creation of the U.S. twisted politcal system. What was the alternative? The warmongering corporate puppet Hilary Clinton who along with the DNC were proven to have sabotaged the campaign of the man who should be sitting in the Whitehouse today? Americans need to draw a line, but not between each other Eminem, but against the twisted circus that is US politics and an out of control media.
Eminem dissed Hilary Clinton on his track Role Model from almost 20 years ago and now they are on the same side? As a long time Eminem fan I’m smdh on this 🙈
Oh god just stop... this shit is so cringy to watch... what happened to eminem. His rhymes weren’t even good..
All I see is white people hating lol they never used their accounts until now. They really pissed! hahaha
This video is so horrible even the Elites are like we fucked up! Lol. Thank you for no true answer to what really happened in Vegas! No answer$! Now u want us to believe this shit?!
Celebs call Trump a pervert or sexist, yet they allowed Weinstein to continually sexually assault women for 20 years. Up to a 100 different people knew what he was doing, but no one came forward. Bunch of cowards. We've only heard from the Women who said NO. Imagine the dozens who said yes, and are too embarrassed or signed NDA's to come forward. He was a huge supporter of Hillary of course, seems most wealthy predators are. Maybe they just like her husband lol
donald the bitch oh wow you're being real edgy there kid
Hush lil baby don't you cry. Everything's gonna be alright - Eminem Mockingbird
Eminem but you don't say s*** and lafanda  dames didn't say it on 911 because you was swallowing dicks..... ahhhhh that S*** hurts so much when it goes all the way down your throat and the dick starts breaking ya ribs.......I call Eminem the new Dennis Rodman friends with Kim Jon un.... let everyone call out a fake rapper, either he she shows or she doesn't..... to fight for whatever she believes in...at@eminemillfuckup. And lets see how tough Marsha is.
em great job but dont people say somthing about u and the satan u prey now
He looks like such a dad with that scraggly beard.
Wow, I thought Eminem was bigger than that. You played that card, so easy to agree with what everybody else has already said. Why don't you address how he brought back jobs to your hometown, or did your forget.  Who cares, its just more dollars to him, you not only lost a fan, but my respect too. Really Disappointed =(
The dare devil is back. Rap God. Inspiration for billions. And me the worshipper of him.
this is foreal the funniest shit ive ever seen/heard in my life. if he's trollin, he did a damn good job.\nM A G A
So if we join eminems side, wtf is he going to do for us? lol
GUYS CHECK MY MUSIC OUT IMA NEW ARTIST ON THE COME UP IT WOULD BE A BLESSING https://soundcloud.com/fuzzhead_23/lost-it-last-summer
Remember the good old times when Em' made fun of the Celebs he despised? I do!
Trump got an big L there
I feel like the dichotomy that he set up was unfair.
I don't know who forced him to do this but it's as cringeworthy as it gets.
Feminem sucking to many BBC's..
Why is everyone having a shit
All of a sudden he can grow a beard?
I don’t like trump but this is shity
im sorry lowkey it was trash he can do better and i know all the dickriders gone complain but it is what is
You ruin the name of good candy.
he looks so weird with a beard
how did this fat guy with a pedo beard get 915k likes? and wheres Eminem?
I cringing so hard right now
Trump is really powerful. Look how many celebrities he gets to lose their minds and give him constant attention...it's astonishing. 🤔
Calling DJ Trump a racist come on, really?!
THIS WHITE RAPPER IS WACK! RACIST ASS! \nTHAT WHOLE EMINEM VIDEO WAS ANOTHER SUBLIMINAL WHITE PROPAGANDA DEPICTING BLACKS AS SUBSERVIENT TO WHITES. \n\nWHY MSM ALL JOCKIN' HIM? WHEN OTHER BLACK RAPPERS HAVE DONE MUCH BETTER LYRICALLY!? \n\nWHITE AMERICA STILL DON'T ACCEPT BLACK RAP! \n\nTHIS SOME LOW-KEY RACIST BULLLLSHIT!!!
Well eminem just told me never to buy any of his music. Well, at least we have his permission to boycott him.
Racisms the only thing he's FANTASTIC 4 coz that's how he gets his ROCKS off an he's orange
Aw come on Marshall. We know you're just trying to promote a new album with this bs. You voted for Trump and you know it.
Here in my garage
Okay... What was that garbage?\nI like-d Eminem a couple of albums ago. I also voted for, and support Donald Trump. It seems like Eminem has lost touch with common sense and reality. He should stay out of politics because his lack of knowledge was obvious in those terrible rhymes and it just makes him look like an idiot to those of us who paid for his merchandise to get him where he is today. I feel like I wasted my money on his crap now and have just been insulted.\n\nHe actually sounds dumber than the people he’s poorly, and desperately, trying to rap against. We’ll all know better now... I guess. \n\nPeople!!! C’mon seriously??? That was just terrible gibberish! He obviously just used the lame subject of popular entertainment industry political views as an umbrella topic to crap out whatever that was. Those dudes standing around, listening to that trash, look like a captive audience. Obviously their under his financial wing in some form... but I’m sure they’ll say otherwise if you ask them in public. \n\nOnce again for emphasis 😬 People!!! Why don’t all of you anti-Republicans take a few minutes to simply Google the history of the opposing political party these people are supporting...\n\nI encourage you to start by checking out the simple crayola crayon style  YouTube video entitled, “The Inconvenient truth about the Democratic Party” just to get started. Then PLEASE dig further and deeper for more of the truth because it may surprise you.\n\nWhatever the case, quit listening to the pop culture entertainment industry nonsense and take a moment to understand reality.\nUse your own ideas to draw your own conclusions... Kind Regards
pretty sure 900 thousand is bigger than trumps tiny hands.
lovely to see the illuminati scream HELP!! all these STARS against TRUMP coz they been payed by Hillary and the CLAN! TRUTH going to set you free!!!
Donald Trump isn’t my president\n\n\n\n\nBecause I’m British :P
Where was he 2 years ago? Suddenly he wants to pull a stunt because he's dropping an album in November? This low iq has been is as racist as anyone can get.
Gotdamn! It took a white man to say what everyone is already thinking, even Republicans.
Id like to see the haters do better instead of wine and complain. Easy to be a critic, hard to have raw talent. Talking to you... the deep throated Trump suckers.
all you idiots dissing em understand what he mean before talking down on em you damn Trump supporters...
Is it just me or does he look like the guy from the movie 8 mile
Tell em eminem your the best ✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾#fucktrump2017
I'm amazed at those who still have enough stupidity in them to support Trump.\n\nThe president is completely incompetent. \nHis idea of healthcare reform is poor, and his consistent bickering with an unusually agreeable Congress over the subject only reinforces that.\n\nNo national leader in their right mind would insult the mayor of a city AND blatantly communicate their suspicion of said mayor because their race, all while in \nthe aftermath of a terrorist attack on their city.\n\nThis guy actually told his supporters that deporting dreamers was economically a good idea, and somehow many idiots believed him.\n\nThe list goes on...
Its funny how many triggered conservatives there are calling him trash because of his opinion and saying he's just following mainstream media, but if he was supporting Trump and liberals got mad we'd be called triggered snowflakes.
Daaamnn. \n\nI'm so glad I'm not Donald trump right now.
Whether you like Eminem or you don’t this is real as it gets. Making a remark on trump more of words thought already been said. Y’all can call it attention seeking but needa realize he standing up for what’s right, before y’all be the ones to be seeking for your rights 💯💯
This didn't take balls. \n\nTakes balls to go AGAINST society.\n\nLiberalism is NOT counter culture.   Liberalism IS the culture. \n\nYou aren't raging against the machine. \n\nYou are just another boring cog in it
Well said Em. Waiting for the single!!!
Eminem didn’t have to diss the fans that helped make him rich.
Stop barking, you little bitch. Let President work in peace
garbage rapper
wtf was this shit ...

old Eminem is da bomb. Listen to his track Low down and Shifty from 1997. Just epic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_T1_nw77Q4
Yeah, this is great because talking shit about Trump is a completely original idea which is very, very edgy and not overdone and boring at all.

1:45 shooting Angola? Why Angola?
5:32 giant railguns in space? halo much...?
ALL HAIL SEA PYRAMID
One question... Why fired Angola???
congrats, ur #21 on trending :)))

great
Alright stupid science question... To reduce the friction on the rails, could they not use magnets to levitate it slightly over the rails, similar to mag-lev trains?
would magnetizing the projectile and creating oscilation on the barrells improve or incapacitate this design
If the momentum of the asteroid coming towards earth is *A* then the momentum of the projectile fired at it would be close or equal to *A*\nGoing by Newton's 3rd law that means the satellite will be propelled towards earth with a momentum of *A* as well when firing the projectile. \nso basically it will be as if the asteroid itself hit earth. lol
They should attach it to a mech and call it metal gear 🤔
Guys I’ve got some contest I’ll be winning 75,000k if I can manage to get 200 subscribers in a week. Pls help me out guys! Love you so much 😌😌
BAE systems? Didn't know my gf worked on rail guns.
Oh wait, they don't have internet
This tech can be used for transportation. If it is more cintrolled
Wonder what happens if it misses target? I mean it keeps going for long way at mach6.
I don't imagine any single nation having a space railgun will sit well with any government, even if the intention is a peaceful one.
So the railgun is basically just a giant electro-slingshot!!
I thought it was plasma erupting from the rail, is it not?
Sending a railgun into space would never happen. It would be a diplomatic nightmare for obvious reasons.
My dad is in the military, he's gone right now
When are we just going to move into standardizing ATHENA
One of its huge problem is that it's not EMP proof
I’m waiting for when trump finally nukes North Korea
Its our kinetic scalar satalite, but you did not hear that from me.\n\nMajestic / Cosmic
Military if you somehow see this... USE REBAR METAL!!!!!
Why does this remind me of that American fighter jet that cost a stupid amount of money and had so many design problems that it will never see live combat but it still cost multiple billion dollars.
This video is a lie.  The most powerful gun in the US Army's arsenal is Lada Gaga's cock and balls.
We still use railguns?  Don't they break after using a few times?
Relying on a round to complete the electrical circuit is a fatal flaw.  The rail gun will always have very severe barrel wear.   Now if only we could use a mass driver (linear motor)(ungoverned meglev track) or Gauss gun (coil gun) (Stacked stator rings) you could avoid friction with the barrel sides all together.  Both of these frictionless guns are far more complex to engineer and miniaturize.
5:07 where is this ship?
'gee whiz' weapons are fine. But without good intel they're (mostly) useless.
yet they lost to a bunch of gook farmers with crummy ak's and sand dindus with an IQ of 80 kek
We need fusion power so bad.. actually we need fusion and high temperature superconductors and then we will be sligshot into the future.
I have a powerful weapon inside my pants.
why dont enginners at BAE & lockheed martin try to find a free way to disable all weapons on earth?\nsuicidelockheedmartin.com
If this was a satellite this it would be sick af because you could have the satellite from cod ghosts and gears of war and the speed also generated by gravity would make this device so powerful, it’s dumb. If you wanted to take out Kim jong un during his parade, just put in the coordinates and that Boi would be donezo. If you put a chamber full off plutonium and make the surrounding shell thick steel, you got yourself a nuke from space. Or you could straight up drop a massive metal tube from spce and it would devastate the surrounding area
I'm sorry to inform you, but you have mistaken\nas F=ILBsin(theta) is not Lorentz force it is Amper's force, for Amper's force is a scalar addition of all Lorentz forces, however, still not the same
Do a video on fibreglass—it's a very interesting material. I'm studying maritime technology and I've learnt that fibreglass is lighter and stronger than steel
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIT for the dummies like me. \nwe could potiensialy shoot things into space with just electricity?! :O
1:30 I too would blow up Angola
i am sorry to say this but except from the ICBM interception is a total same for so much  brain power being use to make weapons also a reilgun in orbit seams scary destroying cities from space kind of scary
*War, War never changes.....*
Use it on antifa
BAE Systems\n\n\n\nBritish-Airspace-electronic Systems... Don't cum yourselves America, it's not even yours mate.
Could you make a video about naval lasers next? I heard they are too a recent technology being tested on ships.
1:43  why is the battleship shooting Angola XD
So do they have any ideas on how you fix the gun ripping itself apart after 2-3 shots thing? It seems like they're gonna need some kind of revolutionary breakthrough for this to be viable.
*_I follow the path of the most brilliant engineer of all time, Adolf Hitler, to make the world a better place!_*

Sloooow doooown!
The A-10 warthog ❤️
And what about EMPs?
Pls revive me, I got a railgun. \n\n\n\n*revive*
Well, why not make the firing rails replaceable?
Idk bro, the tail gunner isn't that powerful in Boxheads. Rapid fire shotgun is where it's at
weapons in space, trump will love that.
My biggest concern would be how versatile this platform would be. Some missions require rounds to carry small cargo such as a flare with a parachute to help shoot ground targets at night with the aid of marines. Or have special fuzes on the round that allow us to control the ordnance better rather than every round just being a high speed tungsten round(for example detonation delays that allow penetration before explosion or buckshot-like pellets). But good lord, with the projectile speeds that the current configuration of the railgun are at, our potential max range would be enormous hopefully over 100NM so we can be more useful to our ground troops that are more inland.
there aren't even as many views as subscribers, how is this trending?
Already implemented on the USS Gerald Ford
Why hasn't Elon Musk come up with a solution to this yet?
Heheh you all think the pentagon will release classified prototype weaponry they released the rail gun as they know it is safe to distribute to their military personnel but they’re not dumb enough to not show it to public eyes before insight and research has been cleared then it is released to the public eye. But till then it is always a blind eye and you’re not only paying taxes for their service you also pay for their prototype research, \n\nAn example everyone should know Steve jobs was given a choice over his technology the same with bill gates, the military was always first to use and exercise it in the field. \n\nThis railgun is most likely insighted since 1994 as we all know many where talking of space era objects in that time a lot whether it was articles, movies or games.
I wonder if we will ever see a rifle or pistol that shoots a laser beam that would be so cool
The railguns best use is perhaps when it destroyed a Combiner on a pyramid
I'm doing Engineering, but it's funny how he says Make the world a better place by creating even deadlier weapons.
The greatest military power is the power of the mind, not the weapons.... Any country wise enough to live quietly in peace, such as Switzerland for example, that allows freedom for its people while remaining a threat to no one, smiles at the USA for spending it's vast treasure on military weapons... rather than for the betterment of it's people and their human necessities such as infrastructure, schools, medicine, etc....\nShow less\nREPLY
I've got a rail gun in my pants - Kid who grows up to be a bartender at Chilis*
Do you think they will just end up using a nuclear reactor to power these guns?
US Military = #1 terrorist organization in the World.
I live near the base where they test the Railguns (Dalghren NSWC, VA) and these things can be heard for miles! Incredibly loud and powerful. They shake the houses around the base too. At least I think what they are testing are railguns and not something else. They are very cool, thank you for this video Real Engineering
Fuk the US military....bunch of pawns to the power elite imperialistic terror regime known as the US government.
Check out profile for killer videos scorpion king of mkxl
'\ndont have to show this video in here about cannon gun...\nenemy countrys can watchs this video, learns, copys, makes, trainnings, return revenges
This is absolutely fascinating! You earned a sub buddy
I don't think putting a rail gun on a ship makes sense. Battleships aren't useful in modern warfare.
Just a correction. As a minimum of 6 years ago, rail guns could hit a speed of Mach 7. I’d imagine they might be able to go faster now.
Imagine getting hit by a projectile travelling at Mach 3 Speeds, DAMM
Wouldn't the rail gun over penetrate the armor of a ship
I thought our greatest gun was the Debt Star?
One step closer to the Death Star
The guns on my arms are more powerful than the US's power fullest gun

Liberals now want to ban rail guns
They have way more then they tell us. \n\nTo say anything is their most powerful weapon would be a complete and utter lie. \n\nThey have technology that the average every day citizen wouldn't be able to comprehend even the people with higher iqs would be like Neanderthals banging rocks together to make fire. \n\nI'm talking 4th density technological advances

You watches the whole video?..... THAT'S SO FRIKIN DOPEAAAAAAAAA
:0 welp mine name starts with a p ....
Does anyone else sing along when she does that rap of hers
Thought this video was about Liza breaking it out to the world that she's pregnant. WOOP GUESS NOT.
In your next video can you please attempt to do a dance from your high school in 2013.
Who else lowered their volume before she randomly screamed in the beginning😂
I feel like this how liza was when she was little
Liza Logic\n\nHas homework \nBut still poops her pants
I cringed at the title but the video is actually pretty amusing
man lizzza you just make my day
She keeps making pregnancy and baby vids she's totally hinting something
i recomend you turn down your volume because i might scream AHHHH you are so cute
This is the most fun I've seen in a video in a long time!
#32 on Trending...HELL YEAH LITTLE BROWN BOY!!!
I died a little bit inside when i realized that I watched all of her videos and now I feel like there is nothing that I can do to entertain myself with... (Except going through the list again and again)
you should do helga babysits baby Liza 😂😂

LOL XD LOL 2:29 DAVID HAS BABY LIZAS VOICE!!!
STAY AWAY FROM HIS PEKER! lol
I hope you enjoy the video, if you did! Be sure to Subscribe to see more :)
Tom, your grandad got it the wrong way around.  If the royal standard (the flag that was above Buckingham palace in your vlog) is flown, the queen is in residence.  If the Union Jack is flown, the queen is NOT in residence.
Your grandad is Amazing! We Love GORDON! ❤️
You look a lot like your grandpa
gordon is so adoreable! i love this vlog
You should have sent one of your post cards to Ron
So this video has barley 200k views and is in the trending section and has 8 ads in it... okay...\n\nThis guy also conned his fans.

Hate to say it but Gordon is wrong! When the Union Flag 🇬🇧flys above the palace the queen is NOT home, when the Royal Standard flys  above the palace like in the video it shows the Queen is home

I fucking love Gordon lol
All the places you visited remind me of Assassin's Creed Syndicate

Your grandad is the cutest!!! 😂😊
I didn't know Tom knew boulevard of broken dreams
Hate ta tell ya, but she's home when the Royal STANDARD is flying not the Union Jack. So the flag that you guys saw meant she was home
SERIOUSLY TOM !! there is a video of a guard screaming at a girl in that same spot.People thought it was a joke but its not.The vid would be about 5 -6 yrs ago.Because It was around the time that Jackass was filming there movie. MAYBE its Alice ???  Need to have a search on youtube
Your right tom about the pendolino or technically class 390 its max speed is 140mph but only goes 125mph
I think you’ll find the queen and royal family bring in money too Tom. Lots and gives our country a identity and shows our tradition and history.
The flag at Buckingham Palace was the Royal Standard flag which meant the queen was at home. Its not the Union Jack
Your Grandad needs his own Insta!! Who cares about people's cats and dogs, I wanna see a page about Gordon!❤
Some of Russia is in Europe some of its in aisa it's weird
The flag above the palace was the Royal Standard meaning the Queen was in residence. The union Jack is flown when she is not.
@ryanastley97
What a beer pour!!! I'll show you how to pour a proper one
Is Russia in Europe?\n*facepalm FFS Tom
Should take em with ya to la show em round the sights
We havent left the European Union
Taxi time, granddad time, must be tom time, love this guy so much.
good vlog! but 40min is waaaay to long :/
Is Tom's grandad from his mum's or dad's side?.
Tom if your ever back in London with Lidia or Gordon or anyone I live in London and for Dinner would recommend Aqua at the shard, Hutong at the shard (Best Chinese Ever ever been to), The Ivy, The Wolseley, Nobu (Japanese) and the OXO tower.
I'm not sure I've ever commented on a YT vid before (even though I've been watching you for hundreds of years now) ...I just felt totally compelled to tell you that you look absolutely especially stunning here, just such a babe! X
was gutted when you didn't try the urban outfitters dress on :(
I LOVE your makeup! Minimal face makeup and eyes and a bolder lip. Very different than a lot of looks that you rock, but it's perfect and I want to try it!
You should ditch the extensions and cut your hair into a bob
Why didn't she try on the dress?  I wanted to see it :(
Hi Helen ! In what size did you buy the yellow jumper from Zara? Just asking for reference, I like my jumpers to be oversized but not too much 😅😊
I don’t know why Helen, but you are one of my favorite youtubers! You are always so happy.. I love your editing... the colors.. the music and ofcourse your style! You are just so cool :D
Primark have jumpers almost the exact same as the one around 5 mins, it's chenille! Th only difference is the neckline
Eeee I have that white jumper with the fluffy sleeves and I adoooree it!! It's so nice on and super comfy 🖤
Oh my gosh you are soooooooo beautiful ... I love the no makeup look and your hair are on point  🤘💗🎀
you look sooo beautiful! love the minimal makeup look on you!! 🤗💕
looooved your hair and makeup in this video helen! x
Where are your pants from ? The ones with the cow print ? 😊
You look so young and fresh in this video! Would love to see an updated skincare routine, your skin looks amazeballs.
I love the lipstick you're wearing in the cut away!!!!
OMG YOUR MAKE UP LOOKS STUNNING! love love love it!
You have the most beautiful facial bone structure! ❤️ kisses!
Can you consider signing up and selling on Depop please!? LOVE most pieces you wear.
You are literally the girl in me before you. You look and sound the exact same
I dont want to say that i like you way more without much eye makeup or in general makeup, but you LOOK SO GOOD and fresh without heavy makeup! It looks so natural and ..just great! :)
Crazy I never noticed your eye colour before! Must be your makeup today -  😍
You look AMAZING in everything 😍😍😍
That white jumper from Zara looks\namazing on you! Reminds me of Christmas!!!
LOVING LOVING LOVING you in minimal makeup you look so fresh and Parisian!
https://xn--g0haaaaaaaaaaaa.gq/r/?S8RGoh0KMu3rc=2vFo3i3TaO8ncJnMThxLOBU1zJLSdN76moJ
Makeup looking lovely! Few things will be seeking out this weekend. It's Prince of Wales check, rather than dogtooth or herringbone x
Omg you look so pretty with minimal makeup!!!! ❤
You are so beautiful Helen x
Loveing the makeup! You have beautifull skin and don't need foundation :D
I love the way you manage to make everyday or more casual outfits look really interesting and glam. You have the best style :)
everything about you is perffffff xx
You are so beautiful. Your lashes are just INCREDIBLE.
Just wanna say how much I love your videos and the effort you put into each of them. Got a little bummed when I didn’t seen “try on” in the title, but alas! You tried things on (I hate when hauls aren’t try ons, you don’t know what things look like!) You never disappoint.
OMG, babez, you look so cute today! What is that lipstick you're wearing in the try ons? It looks so beautiful on you! Pls let me know! xx
Always find it weird  I see stuff I already own in hauls
ahhhh I’m trying to save money😩😩😩😩😩
Really digging the minimal makeup and that you can see some of your beautiful freckles more! Love the vid as always Helen!
Where's the jumper ur wearing from? It's amazing
This could've potentially been a very expensive video for me to watch, if I didn't have to shop in the girls/teen section of every store! 😂😂😂
That top at the end went with everything you put on! Love it 😍
Actually loving the lighter makeup on you, looks so fresh! And that white jumper from Zara wowza! XX
@Helen if you want to revive your old face jeans you can buy some dylon dye that you put in the washer, worked a dream for me! hope this helps!!<3
i looove the lace up kinda jeans so much!!
As soon as you said that you’ll love this jumper I knew which one it was before it came up, saw it the other day and fell in love 😍😍😍
On the white boots, the right foot has a stud missing.. unsure if you noticed?! 💗💗
I love the fluffy sleeves from Zara - such a statement piece :) xx
I bought a mustard jumper just like that yesterday but in Primark, fucking LOVE it!! So warm and incredibly soft 😍 \nLove, love, love your sense of style! 💞 xx
The v neck on the rusty/mustardy jumper looked really flattering on you, Helen! Really lovely. Love your hauls :) x
Your pink coat YES I'M IN LOVE
You didn't show us you in the yellow dress!!
I absolutely love how mustard colored clothes look with your purple hair 😍
Love love love that you have your own style and that you aren't like all the other you tubers that are carbon copy's of each other. So refreshing 💕💕
Those bright pink trousers look so good on you! I'm loving everything you've gotten in this haul 😊 x
The slight rumbling makes me think of paranormal activity when the bass comes up when crazy shit is about to happen
They do the coat in grey as well - bought it a few weeks ago it's amazing!!
You look so lovely and fresh without lots of eye make up!
You look AMAZING in the cutaways!! I don't know if it's your make up or weight loss but your face just looks incredible, and obvs just love this video because what's not to love 🤙
Hel you look so cute and fresh faced in the cutaways where you’re trying the stuff on!
Love your style Helen- so fun which is what fashion should be !
looking so cute with this make up 😍😍 great video Helen 😊❤❤
On the white boots there is a big stud missing ( right side of the screen)
Helen, how do you like the UO top? I've been eyeing it forever and am on the fence about buying it because I'm plus size so I don't know how well it'd fit me.
Do a video with all your favourite new looks!
The fact that I can kinda hear the music but not really is making me crazy
That's a Helen coat 🍉💜 Love the whole haul. Xoxo
I love this makeup!!!! Like the minimal eye and brighter cheek makes you look like a beautiful doll!!!! Love u <3
You just ooze beauty and are so stunning ☺️ I genuinely dig your whole aesthetic ❤️❤️
I love white boots! I have a pair of white platform ankle boots with a three inch heel, the entire thing made me five inches taller! I wore them to death though and I think they only have about two wears left before they really fall apart!
I was watching this intro thinking what have u done different your makeup looks so good and fresh!! Then u said u had hearsay any on 😱 man I wish I looked fresh with no makeup lol
Can we just talk about how everything fits her perfectly?
Miss Helen I think you need some Freddie's of Pinewood in your life and Vivian of Halloway
Helen looks like paloma faith in the video!
Not much on pink but that coat though. Love It!!
Omg I love your makeup in this Helen!! Literally looks so good and makes your skin look super amazing!! Love it❤️
gosh, i dont even know why but im looking at you and seeing as .. elf! or smth .... just add sharp ears edge ! ok i just go, scrool down
I love when Barney makes his special guest appearances 😂
Helen where is your jumper from?? I lurvvvv it xx
Do you ever shop in Pull & Bear? I just imagine a lot of the stuff being things you'd wear!
Just wanted to comment on how stunning you're looking in this video! xo
Oo I really like those lace-up trousers and that coat!
Always do but love your make up so much in this video!

The material is called cheneille I think ? So incredible in jumper form and doesn't get bobbly !
I love your videos especially the hauls.. I love hearing you describe items hahaha, rustardy mustardy :)
Haha love you girl your lipstick missing in the corner and mascara  all over your eyelid.  No fucks given
I love your style! ❤❤❤
I can’t find a good pair of jeans anywhere!! I’ve tired topshop Jamie jeans (last 6 months) tried new look (sizing is so bad), asos again sizing issues (always falling down) superdry jeans (too pricey & fake pockets) so any suggestions I’m open too XD.  #help!!!
OMG! Finally I found a liverpool youtuber! 👏👏👍
I am seriously considering a full on genderbending dragqueen lifestyle when I see half the clothes you buy and wear. Like that floral mustard dress, good lord, I'd be living my Janis Joplin at Woodstock-dream 24/7!
Loved this? Where’s the cute blue tie up top from? xoxo
Thank you so much to Quidd for sponsoring us! Go get some Ryland, Drew, and Shane STICKERS here!!!!!! it's free!! http://bit.ly/2xs3Evj
Truffles are like mushrooms under trees but they're different and the most expensive is White Alba Truffle
That doesn’t look appetizing for a $1000 dollar pizza
I'm just comfortable with my sexuality\nSo I can admit when I see a guy who has a handsome face and pretty eyes and a rock hard chest and those....\nAnyone get the song reference\nNo \nOkay well I'll just go kill myself now

But Shane had on under armors not sketchers lol
I thought the pizza would be huge, like as big as the table
u made me hungry so i made a pizza for me so i can watch and eat at the same time lol
Those are under armor not sketchers you fake fan
I had pumpkin spice today and it's so nasty
Elevated 😂 I love the waiter so much

I love Drew so much 😂😂❤️
Finally I've been waiting for my fat bitch to eat food again love you Shane
That pizza does not look good.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE...do a vid where you explain your sponsors and talk about how much you get and stuff like that
While Shane is paying $1000 for pizza,I'm scrapping up change for bags of hot fries. *sigh* mbn
OMG, we need a complete version of The reason is food
Oh no I'm comfortable with my sexuality\n\n\nWHY DO I RELATE

Does Drew have an ironing board on his bedroom wall?
0:02 the face you make when the food looks bomb
YOu are so funny
Like if Shane should react to BTS and other kpop groups
Shane should test out Karina Garcia's slime kit
How do u save the stickers u get in Quidd

I really loved the waitress she seemed super cool

Pizza fact!!
I would savor that pizza!
Watch bitmoji sponsor Shane and he be like HEY GUYS YES OMGGG BITMOJI IS SPONSERING ME OMGGG
woman crush #1
What if that's just the way Jimmy Fallon laughs? 🤔
Such a nice Person :)
pinks awesome. Jesus this guy is cringe to watch tho. So fake with his laughter. Are all american talk show hosts this bad?
So, I've emailed Marshal...\nThats a different level xD
i have't seen a Pink Eminem... nah!
Pink suit to the VMAs is literally LIFE!!!
I'd like to see Pink's bean.  I'd also love to play with her bean.
If she didn't look so damn stupid we might actually pay attention to her voice.
She's so great, god, I thank the universe for people like her.
I love to hear her lagth, I think I would tickle her for a long time just to hear it.
https://youtubem.video/r/?0Pr0v7FiTONNsiSNaCMwMGZ1mpdq9Ug=MxLkV5tRvjHDrB4srt
Ughhhhh STFU and let her speak
Pals rate Anyone  identify bigger  this case? laxghing
I would be honoured to have anal sex with PINK.
She is lovely.
I thought this was going to be a really sweet story about how her son loves her voice so much he cries when she sings... oops XD
1 minute long ad before the video WHOA
She’s fucking awesome! \nCan’t wait to see you in New Zealand
why at 0.28 does he always do that fake laugh?
Yo is she the one, Simon said was trash??
Give leading please export potato offer site treatment identical category.
I died when she said Eminem
P!nk and Em? Never even imagined it but now I can't stop wondering!
I love this woman! So excited for the new album and hope she brings her tour to the UK!
I cry when she sings too. Because I miss the old Pink. Now all of her songs are practically all the same.
I was psyched until I heard little Marshall was belching out his stench on her album.
Love me some P!nk. ❤ #Awesome
Ugh I love her dress. Ugh I love her.
That colour suits her
He is so fake.
Clicked because PINK HAS A SON?? I know she had a daughter but whaaaaaaat?
Love Pink. And just wait until it's her daughter AND granddaughter that cries when she sings lol!
She has balls too.
Fallon's ratings are tanking lol
More pc social justice warrior mentality.
Jimmy... as annoying as usual.
Fallon just doesn't seem to connect with his guests. He's like an over excited kid on Christmas morning. Is that from smoking pot?
What do you see in your mom's hair
Wow, she's really cool 😎
*There have never been a pink m&m*
Holy shit Jimmy. It's not that difficult to learn the name of your guest's children and spouses. I have seen him fumble this so many times. It's so awkward to see him ask about people he clearly has no clue what they're called. I'm sure he has a research team who can write this very basic information on a card for him.
Whooo!! Can't wait for the tour
Who the hell cares.
Hello! I like your channel. Subscribe to my\nchannel.
She sound like such a mom talking about her son it's amazing love her so much
Punch that cuck in the face
Fire Starter,.....lol, priceless,....and actually, she does, lol, and that lip synch part, ha, amazeball's!!  Love her, and her new album is amazing :D
he cries because this sl.ut is turning the little dude gay...
I realized that you don't tend to talk politics on this show, and I appreciate that. It's unfortunate that your ratings would be higher if you did get political, but keep at what you do, this is a show for everyone.
Love it!! Check me very fast bass player https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfjY1UtIWmDN4sDXtpt2hIg?sub_confirmation=1
The part where she talks about Revenge and how she was drinking wine and wanted a Rap Grammy and asked Eminem and whatnot-- she gave that interview on the radio here in New York VERBATIM like to the point I was just wondering if they edited out Jimmy and put in Elvis Duran's voice like every little joke she made and EVERYTHING. Until Jimmy interrupted her joking along about the email it was EXACT. Like, I get that they have to tell the same stories over and over and shit when they're doing promo for an album and especially for one specific single BUT usually their answers are slightly different seeing as they're talking to someone different etc... this literally like was weird and made me feel like she's a robot HAHA. Seriously google the interview if it's up and you'll see... so weird. Ver-bay-Tum. Lol\n\n  Incidentally, Revenge is my favorite song rn like I LOVE it hahahaha it's just different and cool and funny. Also I love Eminem so there's that. Two thumbs up. (That song, plus the interview, actually made me DL the entire album and so far I've listened to like half of it and it's great, I highly recommend it).
If you sub to me I will sub to you
I cry when she sings too and at my age I'm nearly deaf.
Come to Poppa \nhttps://youtu.be/tuveMDIAbd8
I cry whenever she sings
Revenge is sweet
Idk why pink is so hot
#AnittafeatPink
PINKS A MAN!!!!!!
More Pink, less Miley please!
Why p!nk wearing Blue? 😂
Love Pink and love Eminem :)
I do too.. Bleeeawk,😝😝😝. 😂🤣😂🤣😂
Who else loves P!NK!!💕💜
Pink: Hi\nJimmy: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Who is Pink
Time is a heartless bitch to me,,but Missy Pink is holding up really well.   Funny stuff.   Meatball and Firestarter,,Ha!,,,  Kids have a bright future,  so long as their mom has a good heart, which she does.   Good luck Mom!
who cares? this bitch is ugly
P!NK has been around forever, yet I notice she's only recently been really famous, I don't get it.
what a brave transgender pink is. and what an Adonis belt!
Too bad cant afford to see her live
March 1st is my birthday!!!!!!! I will be 18!!!!!!!!! I LOVE YOU PINK
Pink is cool. M&M is a douche-bag.
Me too, she's not very good
I see Eminem in the description I click.
P!NK went to school with my mom in highschool
Pink is ugly,  and her music is bad, and shes stupid.
Shes so genuine and beautiful..good on you ms lady!
have u guys thought of P!nk doing the Superbowl Halftime show?

Pink stinks
yo pink is qeer! JUGALO FOR LIFE!
Stink
She should be a teacher of celebrity's behaviour.
This lady is such full of shit.... Jesus appears when she sings too
I am going to go see her live in May. I am so excited, not only is it going to be my first concert, but it is also to see the person I have wanted to see live for like 6-7 years. I love her so much. I can't even describe how excited I am
She is so cool...
One of the BEST female artists out there!  Love the album!!!
carey is so handsome
same
I love pink
She’s a legend 👌🏾
I want her to be my Mommy. :D
I cry whenever she sings. It's awful
And now MOM... MOM.....show us your NIPPLE rings..... Your only REAL claim to fame.... ..good God....HOLLYWOOD NOTHING TRASH.
Tom: I'm going to see if I can get it off... proceeds to make 'eeee' noises... lol ^^
😂 that’s pretty clever! I’m not sure if I’ll try it, but the way I’m procrastinating, there’s a good chance 😅
Tom I am really sorry but you are too cute to be scary 😘😘😘
 and you can breathe, which is nice \nI would never have guessed, Tom:
You should stick light black tights over the mouthpiece so that you can still see out but one can't see your face as good from the outside
You're going to be a fun dad one day :)
tom in a box. so cute
4:07 wtf was that noise that came from inside Tom
Thank you  for  sharing a brilliant idea  for our grandsons .
When your'e googling ideas for halloween costumes then Tom's video notification pops up <3 <3
How did you get the arm holes even?
so creative Tom, I love it!
He is so cute. Like lil brother :))
ahaha this was so impressive and funny at the same time i loved it!!
Hiding your hot body with a box... That's a crime for sure!!! ;-)
the noise that he makes from 4:10 hahahah wthhh
She's an artist
his eyes are literally so pretty omg
You are such a child tom
HE'S SO HOT HOLY F U  C K
Love it love it. Love it. I am going to make one for halloween. Thanks. Love it. Love it. Love you too.
I'm exited cause im visiting london next days. Hope to see you soon
I watched it in a public place.. can you guess how people looked at me when this video was at 4:07 ?
Looks great!!\nYou could try and put some sort of see through netting on the mouth area so it's a little more difficult to see your face. Just a suggestion.
You make me laugh when i saw you used the costume 😂 but its great i dont have idea for my Halloween but now i have idea thanks a lot :)
You are very clever with your hands!!!
This inspired me! I'm going to try to make an actually good homemade costume this year, I do them every year but usually ten minutes before I need them so they always suck.
I can just hear Lance now Oh Tom:
You do the most diverse things in your videos.  That keeps it interesting and you are consistent in your posting too.  Watching you do things from cooking, working with children, exercising and more shows your diversity and shows different sides of you too. Thank you for your efforts.
nice, Tom! it looks really cool and original
Wait that circle cut was his head 🤣🤣🤣🤣 he couldn’t get out the box
Now you need to make one for LANCE! Two Lego pieces that stick together.  ;)  Although I'm not sure where the scary part would fit...it would only be cute, cute, cute!
Your look like a great lego charActer. You will such a good daddy, you could help your babies with stuff like this and projects at school.
Tom i dare you to like and reply to my comment.🤗
I just read a Halloween fan fiction, which involved Tom Holland wearing a Speedo as he was dressed up as Tom Daley...\nThen TH got it on with Hugh Jackman, who was dressed as a caveman...
It's cute that you look like you're having fun while doing this costume. 😍
Your mouth is covered which means you won't be able to have any Oreo cupcakes
Wear a yellow long sleeved shirt to complete the transformation! Looks great, by the way.
The sound he makes when he takes the box off is hilarious
The noises he makes when he's putting in the costume is adorable it is will to live
Let me just say that, Lance has his hands full with you!  LOL, what a clever boy you are!
Tom Daley - the craft daddy we didn't know we needed
Where's HelloXRyan...someone send this to him
Hi Tom, you should get a black second skin to cover your face inside the lego head.   Hiding your smiling face would make it extra scary.
Ok. Now Lance needs to make one  and we vote....Team Lance 😂😍
I am not afraid! 😘😘😘😘
u are too cute to be scary :)
You are so cute 😭😂
Good Job Tommy. Have Lance dress up as a Ballerina. That would be hilarious ! 😂👍✌️🤘🤙😃🤙💋
All I'm going to say is so so so funny and cute ..... you go Tom !!!
Hi Tom. First, are you going to scare Lance? Second, what costume do you think he will wear? I love your costume. What fun. I hope you have a great time. Take care. Scary love and hugs. LOL Greg G.
oh my gosh you need to make the lego claw hands to complete your look!!! that would just make your costume 100% epic HAHAHA
Did you manage to safe your sofa after your last video?? 🙊😜
This is hot and cute at the same time. Mixed feelings here
LANCE DONT LET YOUR HUSBAND OUT OF THE HOUSE LIKE THIS
He’s so cute!!
You're such a sweet adorable silly man Tom. 🤗🤗🤗
Cool outfit for a party Tom, but I'd suggest you might make a slight front flap adjustment 'cause if gotta take a leak during the party it's going to be a challenge!
Great work

Not bad actually.
Does anyone know a link to that Adidas jumper?😂
Oh my god! This is sooooo cute!!!! <3

Fun Fact: LEGO is short for “lege godt” , that’s dainish and means Play good\n👏Education everybody👏

Book an appearance with Martha Stewart on her show.  You'll end up with your own franchise.  Loved the video.  Role model for kids and adults who think they have to go out and rent or buy a costume.  Tom is making Halloween fun again.
Lol, my country don't celebrate Halloween soooo.... Still give you your like :D
Very crafty and clever, Tom. Definitely worth a try. Although, it has to be in February, for carnival, as we don't celebrate halloween over here in Malta. :)\nThanks for the video, mate.
Cool costume! BTW what brand is your jumper?
Tom you're supposed to be a grown up what you playing at doing stupid video about this
How is this trending?
If there was a ballon dor, for the best footballer at after-game interviews, Deemey would win it.
He roasted Bellerin 😂😂😂
Good one lads👌
Thank you Cleverley for blessing everyone with a lit Arsenalfantv today.
Used to really dislike deeney but don't mind him now. Not afraid to be honest and seems like a good captain. And funny aswell
Only arsenal could make cleverly look so good 😤
What a performance from Tom and the impact off the bench from Troy!
tom cleverleh'
how much of a small club is arsenal
I NEED TO GO HERE IMMEDIATELY, such a beautiful vlog <3
i hope there's more greece vlogs!!
Aslan's crocs though. yasss bisshh slay all day. 9:47
https://youtubem.video/r/?VMt4wsL4Twjv=db8Y7yd2ZUgPOEgsVkqK5KjM9CIY
Wow, Santorini is stunning!!! 💦💦💦
everything was lovely!
https://xn--g0haaaaaaaaaaaa.gq/r/?S8RGoh0KMu3rc=2vFo3i3TaO8ncJnMThxLOBU1zJLSdN76moJ
I'm so glad you visited my country and had such a wonderful time. You should visit again and discover the unique beauty of many other islands as well! Lots of kisses!
this video was so calming to watch... dreamy
You are such a cute couple.
The prices for the hotel are absolutely ridiculous!
I really really enjoyed this vlog! Now I want to go there too!!
Please break down your trip to Santorini on your blog! I do want to visit. The hotel room looked extremely claustrophobic though, so not sure I could stay there even though it looks beautiful. 😳
this trip of yours was amazing . One of the best vlogs!!!!!  loved it 😘😍
you guys are so damn perfect together UGH want.
The thumbnail is so so sweet especially you guys rarely kiss in front of the camera!
I can't stop smiling! So gorgeous.
Wow i wanna earn that much money via youtube so i plan this kind of trip as well
So glad you two had a great time in my homeland! Next time you are in Greece go to Chania. Aslan will love the history and you will absolutely love this adorable little town.
Ok, it's time for me to finally go to Greece! I've done a bit of research, since I watched your videos, and the end of September, beginning of October is a great time.
Hey Estee and Aslan! My fiancé and I visited Santorini last spring, watching your vlog made me wanna go back asap! Thinking about maybe getting married there... Who knows!
Glad you had a wonderful time, just amazing views. You just cannot beat beautiful Greece at dusk. Great video
Love all the extra information Aslan provides!!! Thank you
whoa i did the hike at the end of july and let me tell you i feel your pain! i pasted your hotel a bunch, i remember those chair with the blue cushin! ugh i want to go back
8:23-8:50 “how do you even know this?!” with your face expression haha! reminds me of my boyfriend. what a lovely paradise !
OMG what a hotel! Santorini is stunning.\nI really enjoy this video cause you two seem so happy... love both 😘
Also, your room is actually a cave. Most homes on the cliff are built inside caves which formed after the volcanic eruption thousands of years ago. It's practical because homes are sheltered from the strong winds which you probably felt at times!
the French Connection floral dress is cute! Like Aslan's pink corduroy shoyt too :0p. The Santorini sunset was so lovely. Gorgeous place!
Stunning place,and an amazing vlog :))
WWWWWWOOOOOOOWWWWWWWW
love is wonderful
The Australian at 1:19 🐨

Can u please do a handbag collection or a top 5 favorite handbags or something. Can tell your really into your handbags by your insta and youtube and you have quite a lot of wow bags. And a lot of us who are watching have the same interest. Would be helpful to know which once are great and which are not so great. Love your vids hugs from sweden
Wow, Santorini looks wonderful! So nice to see you two having a lovely time there :)
Lovely! I've just been to Santorini in May. Oh the memories... I need to go back.  Make sure you also visit Pyrgos!
A great place to get married.. hey Aslan?! \nIt looks amazing guys, I really want a holiday! Jx
Korres makes a Santorini perfume! First, it didn't smell like Santorini to me, but I used it shortly after I was there, and now it TOTALLY reminds me of Santorini and I friggin love it!! \nOh, and I hiked that exact trail ((:
Yay, love you guys' vlogs, have really missed them!

And also look - a cave!...So cute
I love how you bounce off one another, you're a great team! Santorini is so dreamy and beautiful too, it's on The List
the sound quality is so good. What did you guys used for that?
I love you as a couple guys!!! You are the perfect match!
So glad you both enjoy this gorgeus trip, thanks for sharing.
That's one place my husband and I are dying to go soon!  I'm hoping it'll be one of our next getaways! My sister-in-law and her family (including her 3 year old and 10 month old) are in Greece for 5 weeks!! So Stunning there!
That French connection dress is divine!!!! <3 <3 <3 <3 it looks like you had the best time! :) definitely need to get myself to Santorini <3 xxxxxxx
You guys do the BEST TOURS!! I am always relaxed after I watch them! THANK YOU!
I have developed a serious crush on you guys! Your vlogs are so pleasurable to watch, funny, interesting and beautiful. Are you returning to Norway anytime soon? Maybe Bergen? :D
I almost didn't watch this vlog because I want to go to Santorini sooo bad! IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL
Honestly, this was one of the loveliest travel videos I've seen. Of course the views, sun, nighlitghs and the sea (and oh the food!) helped, but it was your chemistry that truly made it magical ♡ haha sorry I'm just a romantic
this was absolutely incredible! My boyfriend and I are now looking into planning a trip here! So gorgeous! Thanks for sharing estee :)
Thank you for this beautiful vlog, I would love to go there! And also, you look so gorgeous in that red dress, damn girl!!!
What a surreal looking place! So dreamy. A random question but, were there any bugs? You guys ate every meal outside and I didn’t see one insect. It truly does seem like paradise.
I’m so jealous ... stuck in my workbooks for school... seeing this thinking...FUCK maybe when i retire... anyone else? so beautiful.
for 800 dollars at least , the hotel has to be iconic hahaha
Looks like you had a lovely time! My husband and I went to Santorini for our honeymoon and it was just 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
This was such a pleasure to watch! So relaxing 😍
What a beautifully shot vlog, wanna go Santorini right now! I love you two so much and your chilled personalities are just so refreshing 💖
the colour correction(filter?) used in the editing really fits well with the whole Santorini vibe
I've been to Santorini!!! You just gave me major FOMO 😄 i would love to go back. I walked those same streets in Oia and snapped an epic sunset picture! It is just so gorgeous on that island 😍😍😍 can't wait to get back there!
Oia is actually the most beautiful place I've ever been to. Amazing.
Santorin si the mots beautiful Island I've ever visited
wow, it looks stunning! <3  the hotel as well- unfortunately it is outta my pricerange. 600 eur per night is a bit overwhelming for me. but still, it looks amazing <3
santorini, mykonos, rodhes, korfu etc. are some shity places to visit. they can just offer you a touristic package that's 100% fake. i m a greek, born and raised in a real greek island. you should visit some other islands like lesvos, samos, ikaria, oinouses, chios if you want to explore how greeks really live and enjoy some magic landscapes! \nmany kisses from greece!
so glad you had the best time in my country
I've watched many vlogs of Greece but honestly this is the only vlog where it made me seriously consider going there. You filmed it beautifully thank you guys!!
Lovely!! I'm Greek & I'm so lucky I have family in Santorini, it is like paradise 🌷Btw check on L'Artisan Parfumeur perfumes, you may find something reminding you of that moment with fresh air, oakmoss, wildflowers & fir. I love Premier Figuier, it reminds me of late summer, early fall scents in Greek islands.
It’s Amazing!!!!love it😍😍
So creepy. We stayed in that hotel and did that trail...... Very creepy. Although it was 95 degrees when we did that hike. I was dead.
I went last October and really want to go back
you're a brave girl in the all grey workout gear.. my underboob and butt sweat (sorry, not sorry) would not allow for that colour scheme! hahaha also where is that pink suitcase from!!! xx
Woah the filming and coloring of this video is so unique! For some reason it makes me feel dizzy though, I don't think I can watch the whole video, anyone else feel that?
I love you guys. I also love that Aslan is a nerd that fully researches everywhere you guys go so he can be the tour guide we all deserve.
Can't wait to see the boat trip it's so so beautiful I want to be there now! Xxx
Hands down nothing more attractive than a intelligent male/female. Aslan is the walking definition of why it is so important for our generation to READ books, gain on that general knowledge. You guys are hands down one of my favourite YouTube couples followed closely by Fleur & Mike Deforce xxx
Perfect travel vlog! Thank you for sharing.  Santorini is #1 on my dream destinations.
The sound and video quality in this video is amazing!!!!!
I am have greek and these video made me sooo happy! Such a beautiful video Estee! You are amazing! By the way, Oia is pronounced “ee-a” :)
we don't need your money. we don't want your money. NEVER come back to Greece.
She's gotten bigger
The colour is sooo off in this video it's a shame

Could you do one on the cult of Chucky?
Things in the 80's looked pretty nice, I can see why my parents miss those times.
Here we are at the edge of the summercamp of human history.. things like that happen all the time at Camp Crystal Lake, its survival of the fittest..In summercamp, its the daily violence of the strong overcoming the weak
You forgot the fact that Alice's dream is somehow of the exact footage from the camera's perspective from the original movie, and not from her point of view, the latter being what she would remember, as opposed to the former.\n\nThe same goes for Part 3, in which the news footage Edna watches is the movie footage from Part 2, showing the actual movie camera's perspective as though it were the in-movie news crew's camera perspective. \n\nThese things along with the fact that he and the camera crew appeared in a reflection in Rick's Beetle window in Part 3 and he left it in the movie might have something to do with the fact that Steve Miner doesn't talk much about these movies.
Please do the new transformers movie.The Last Knight. I bet it'll break the timer again

I’m not gonna lie I thought this was Michael Myers and thought this was a cross over
Never saw the attraction to these movies. Just poorly written, acted, etc . . . The Original Halloween was far better than any of the Friday The 13th movies.
Am I the only one who got a 1:00 unskipable ad

Everything wrong with every movie that ever existed
I lost it at the Scream 2 reference 9:16
Actually, you DO find out what Ginny needed to tell Paul. The next morning she wakes up and sees he wrote “watch out for bears” on the mirror, implying she told him she’s currently on her period (a call back to the “menstrual cycle” comment he made earlier).

I know you probably get a lot of requests, but I would love to see you do Hardcore Henry

Vicky bears an EXTREMELY CREEPY resemblance to this girl named Jade who goes to my school. It is seriously weirding me out
Everything wrong with IT please
Why are all horror movies shitty you ask? It's real simple. You already know the villain, you know all their tricks, you know how they kill. IT'S OLD NEWS. UNLESS THEY GOT SOME NEW KILLER THEN I AIN'T WATCHING THE SEQUELS. AND JUST BECAUSE YOU RANDOMLY GOVE THE VILLAIN A NEW POWER DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S COOL!
According to Friday the 13th Part 9, Jason was brought back by the Necrinomicon from the Evil Dead series.
I got a movie for you: It Comes at Night. It's the worst horror movie I've ever seen.
If you could, would you please make Everything Wrong with A Monster in Paris? You don't have to, but it would be totally cool

I just watched the age of adaline please tell me you have a video for it. There are so many cinema sins I can even spot them while drunk. \n- _-
Can u do one on Reasonable Doubt
How about everything wrong with dark water?
I like the comic book crossover explanation for Jason. Jason's mom used the Necronomicon to resurrect Jason as a deadite, which is why he keeps coming back.
I have not watched the video yet but wtf is up with people commenting stuff about nipples and piss!?
Can you get around to do doing both Tron and Tron: Legacy one of these days?
Do everything wrong with gi joe rise of cobra
13:20 Jason's incompetence from here to the end of the movie makes it go from slasher film to Tom and Jerry.
This made no sense. I thought Jason was the main enemy, and known for wearing a hockey mask. Now i'm being told he wears a sack, and that his Mother did all the killing in the first movie??
Please do IT next, either the 1990 version or the new one!!
Jason is a supernatural Entity of vengeance. He's immortal, and omniscient.

So the Jason movies went downhill when Jason was introduced as the main bad guy?
9:30 the nipples key nipples is nipples to nipples not nipples read nipples the nipples word nipples nipples nipples besides nipples this nipples one
I am curious if there's anything written somewhere, like a wiki or some kind of making of video, about how they decided to shift the killer to Jason after the first movie.  Like, they could've easily just had the mother return over and over again.  I'm not complaining, I LOVE the movies, it's just a curiosity of mine.
wait a minute, I sence pee behind me\n\ni'm weak 😂
Everything wrong with The Rocky Horror Picture Show please!
Sweeney todd!
You need to do everything wrong with Mulan
All I can think about is how much Amber Scholl needs this sparky body suit.
Some pieces are beautiful and other just to tacky, unrealistic and overprice, I can't... too bad. ❤️
No carli this collection so bad \nIts for a nightclub nothing for easy day and nothing for mam
she basically based it on her style (she is rich & famous) and can get away with it because of where she lives, instead of the majority of her fans who aint rich or famous and live in small towns. tf
It looks cheap tho tbh
When you want so many items but you're broke 🤧
These are pieces that she likes if you don't see yourself wearing it then don't buy it I mean complaining is not going to change it.
If I see anyone wear those lace flared pants in public, I will never stop mocking them 😂
Love everything & we need a new brow tutorial! You look stunning 😍😭
hey girl love your style ... just want to let u noe our father god is coming soon repent of your sins and give your life to him god bless. love you
Can anyone tell me what she’s wearing? And so where can I find the same outfit ?😍
Wanna look like a cheap kylie?
seriously? this is a joke
I don't think it's over priced I just think I'm poor. Ahh
Great she did some pieces in plus. Only down side is all the more stylish pieces only go to size 12. I’m a size 14 so I feel limited when it comes to purchasing styles from this collection. Yay for oversized sweaters and sweatpants 😰😩
Hello, look who she collaborated with , of course it won't be dirt cheap. Those are just about the same as regular misguided prices . Idk what yall issue is. If you don't want to buy it then don't . Why you under her comments being rude and unnecessary
I'm disappointed that you didn't try them on.....
Hi everyone, little youtuber over here just trying to find a little more support for my channel 😊😊 I'll support back too!! Thanks!!!
This is an amazing collection! You owe no one an explanation and I am just so excited for you and proud! 💙 stay who you are! Don't let the negative people damper your mood or take away from your moment 🐧
soooo happy theres gunna be plus size!! yay!!! hope theres even more plus size included in the next drop! so happy for you !!!! watching your dreams come reality is so inspiring and makes me so happy for you and gets me excited for my future clothing line!! <3
She's like a second Kim Kardashian
Every piece is so you carli! I'm so excited for the launch!! 💕💗✨💗💕
Dirty Jersey street style on point
Oh my gosh!!! This line is absolutely unreal! I am so excited. I am already building a list
Yes for the plus sizes
You should do like the full grwm videos with outfits from your collection please please please I love your videos
She wants to be a Kardashian so bad. No persona style.
Where is her jump suit from!?
I need to buy all lol
You should try do do some 00 sizes for you smaller girls we wanna look cute too! It's so hard to find sexy clothes when you can shop in the kids section 😶😭😂
Beautiful carlibybel so happy for you!! Try on style video next ?! 😍😍😍😍
Lots of gorgeous clothes Carli. The colors are so gorgeous.
The first Launch was awesome, can’t wait for this one! Yay Carli ✌️
Nobody said that you these are work/casual clothes.
LOL YOUR SISTER IS SO CUTE!! omg i didn't see your billboard!!! up to when is it up?! these pieces are completely out of my comfort zone but they look gorgeous! i absolutely love the jumpsuit youre wearing! congratulations on another collection, I wish you all the success!! and omg im so dumb! I wish i saw this video earlier I was in chelsea early today (oct 14th) I totally couldve gone to see you =(
two drops and a preview video ? We don’t deserve you 😭😭
Im soooo happy for and and proud of you👌👌👏👏👏👏😚😚😚
I wish i could like this a million times. you're so beautiful and i love all the clothes !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I can't wait for 2nd launch on November, I'm hoping that the sparkly bodysuit or something sparkly with long sleeves will be in it because I love the one she's wearing in this video is just wish it had sleeves. 💖🤞
If you guys knew Carli you would know that this is her style and if you follow her snapchat, many items in her collection are very similar to what she wears every day. Not everyone is going to agree with your style  because everyone has their own personal preferences (which some people very rudely expressed) and thats what is so amazing about fashion- the ability to express yourself in your own unique way. Congratulations on your success Carli! Lots of love from Miami!
Omg. I want it all
Honestly the velvet dress look like a bathrobe
Wow this is literally what you call. hard work pays off I need everything in my wardrobe asap xxx
EVERYTHING IS BEAUTIFUL AND AMAZING
How you gonna make a whole video about your new fashion line and it's horizontal, half the clothes are cut off, we can't even see the full OOTD!!! WHAT??!! Through all that trouble to make a video and all you had to do was turn the camera...come on Carli!!!
Libras just KNOW fashion. You killed it with this line, babe. Congrats ✨✨✨
We love you to booh! 😍😘😗❤ I  am definitely going to get a few pieces soon! 👏👏👏❤ #CarliBybel  so happy and proud of you!
These are beautiful!!! I love the cream dress!! 😍😍😍
I think it’s a cute collection and congrats but maybe in the future you can design some plus size clothing. Not everyone can rock the skimpy clothing. Just a thought.
i love soooo many items! motivating me to get into shape so these clothes look nice on me. and the booties are soooooo cute! love the smokey look they have. congrats on your fall/winter line .
So I'm gonna need everything
Carli - I love all this stuff but when you do a try on can you have girls with different body types included as well? I have curves and a tummy so it would be good to see on others too :)
Carlo where did you buy your dress you wearing right now?
I'm really happy for you ❤️ loving some of the pieces in your collection.
Already thinking about hundreds of combinations. My favorite so far is the cut out stone sweatshirt with the navy slinky bandeau top, navy silk trousers, and some nude booties 😭❤️👌🏻
Your collection is beautiful 😍
Love the styles and colors of everything😍
Loooove everything! For anyone complaining about the pricing... if you wanted cheap prices then you’d be getting cheap products.
I want it all girl. ALL. Wish i could afford it :(
been waiting for this
Carli can you please film a lookbook styling these clothes?
Definitely going to be buying some of these pieces 🤤❤️🤗
It’s pursue dreams not pursure. 😐
Absolutely beautiful! Just wishing I had somewhere to wear the clothing 😭
A little shirt w the smallest piece of cloth? 45$?? Yeah idk
Half of the pieces you can get from F21
Your body, your style, your room, and your YOU are serious GOOOALS! OMG! Can I just be you already? 😍💗💕
Hey (no shade just genuinely curious) why are some things available in plus but some aren't? Like what was the process with that? I love your collection, its not the same old boring stuff its funky and fun and YOU! Congrats girl xo
This is a very interesting FALL collection... Definitely not for the average sized woman even though you have plus sizes. I'd like to see how all these peices look on a size 12 model,  along with a size 20 model wearing a crop top. 🤔 Best of luck with this collection!
You just need to be popular and call yourself anything you want. A designer a model.   heck even a neurosurgeon
SO BEAUTIFUL!!!!
all these pieces look like gipsy clothes
CONGRATSSSS CARLI!
Everything is beautiful😍😍😍
Carli your like a barbie doll omg 😥😭
Yass carli!!!❤️❤️
This whole line screams Amber Scholl.
That hoodie is ridiculous...
Before Kylie ....there was Carli 💕
https://youtubem.video/r/?imoTMb71fHVN3UODf7ChDOHNZtl7mA4vNH=CINgO9dEda7GgfwoJnY0m
Carli looks like a dude
I love everything! Congratulations
Loving your pieces

Good job carli!!!
The flare pants on 11:00 😂 neveerrr ! \nLol love you Carly 😘
no, just no
Everything was cute. Simple girls hating cuz they simple and basic.
if you dont like it shop at target or ross people
How is this collection so holy😍
Any small or big Youtubers want to support each other?💜🌸
I'm a big fan of you Carli but I somehow did not like this collection. Your last collection was SO much better, so much so that I had picked up one of your dresses for my birthday. Most of the outfits in this collection will look great on someone who has the perfect body. I just feel being such a big icon you should try and cater to all your audiences and fans. I just hope the second drop isn't a disappointment. xoxo\nP.S This is MY opinion so people who want to leave a rude comment, BACK OFF !
Carli!!! I went to the pop up shop today, waiting since 10:00 until 12:30 and I was really looking forward to meeting you but I had work and I had to leave. It's not your fault, I know you even cancelled the shopping aspects so you could meet all of us but I'm so sad I didn't have enough time. I really hope you have another meet and greet soon here in NY. I can't wait to shop from your collection on Tuesday.
I personally want to thank everyone that donated it means a lot to our families in Puerto Rico. It's honestly very hard to know that our families are going through so much right now and that our beautiful island is destroyed.
Bruno Mars😍😍😍
im shook af bruno was singing in english and then BAM in spanish i did a double take i was like wtf

From a Colombian,  Puerto Rico yo nunca dejare de amarte. Muchas bendiciones
Yeah Puerto Rico thats great and all but that's all that singers say, what about MEXICO! my money better help all not just Puerto Rico  both equally! and yes one or two singers and actors say Mexico, let's mention them both and not just one. MEXICO, PUERTO RICO. One thing I don't understand, isn't Puerto Rico a so called part of the US? so they should and are aiding at least some and eventually more, BUT MEXICO HAS HELP FROM NO ONE AND WITH NO ONE TO HELP REBUILD IN THE FUTURE, specially with that modern sHitler and new Nixon, and still trying to build a new Berlin wall as we speak! oh, and who else is he gonna HAARP next, I wonder? These acts are not natural, and i'm sure this is all a big distraction for more of their devious things to come. Reminds me of what and how it happend in the 1935s thru 1945s, same tactics but modernized. Peace to all that are with peace.
At what point in this video did Jennifer Lopez perform ni tu ni yo
Where's Kim Kardashian ?
Chris Martin❤ 2:17:43
Love your makeup looks, but could you do more makeup looks on brown eyes please! Your eyes stand out a lot with makeup especially because they're light, it takes effort to choose a natural/ish look for brown eyes. Kim Kardashian does this beautifully at the moment, but I can't seem to create the look or pick the right shades. Would love a video on that. Thank you! <3
2:57 😁😁😁👌👌👌
Hi Nic - I know you ladies tend to review/use more high end brands (not a criticism) but I was wondering if you would review the Primark range. X
To me the foundation matches your skin tho
I got the gloss and it just looks like clear gloss on me. The pretty color...disappears.😢
honoring the men in makeup too! Thanks Nic so much, this means so much to someone like me. much love from Orlando! xoxo
This is my favorite review of this brand!
one of the most adventurous full fenty beauty looks i've seen! i think the glowy, natural-looking look most people create with these products are lovely, but you really used her products in the versatile way that rihanna wanted. and you did it really well!
Jesus Christ, that’s horrible 😂 She looks absolutely fine, but that over the top makeup is just too much. Sorry guys, but is it just me?
Really like the Brand reviews n seeing all the products used
You should do a review on Jeffree Star cosmetics! The brands Vegan I believe and available on Beauty Bay
Her hairline goes way back like the 1980's
The lighting was so much better in this video! :)\n\nAlso great review :) x
Best review of Fenty I've seen! Love the unique ways you used the products.
Thank you for always including us darker skin girls in your reviews and recommendations.
I'd like to see a tutorial on Pat McGrath's new eyeshadow palettes.
Fantastic review Nic! Always enjoy listening to your honest thoughts and loved the look💗
Looks great nic.  Would love your opinion on Glossier.
I love but please cut down on the Botox your eyebrows didn't move the whole video!
Could you do a nyx review/tutorial.  I have not used there stuff but have heard good things about it. Also I have extremely pale skin with really dark under eyes. What would you do with that as I have never found a concealer good enough? I love your video. I like how real you are. Keep it up.
This is by far the best review of Fenty Beauty that I have seen so far. 👏🏼
I wasn't sure when I saw it at Sephora last week, but now I want absolutely everything in this range! My poor, poor bank account! lol Thanks for the review, Nic!
Thanks for the review Nic, I love how you showed the versatility of the products unlike the rest of the video reviews.
You're 37 ?! Wow, that's goals aha x
Great review,\nCould you review the Claudia Schiffer’s ?\nThx
This video showed me how much lighting & editing make a difference in makeup videos....the line doesnt seem that great without heavy editing?
I would love to see a review of the new Pat McGrath Labs shadows and liners!
aw I love how you have Tanyas  Burr\ns book in the background
Just started watching you! You are lovely x I am 37 also. I really enjoyed this review. I learnt so much thank you 💕
Love that you used Trophy Wife as an eyeshadow, and not a highlighter like other light skinned girls have done on Youtube.
Love this look so much!! 👌🏼
Would be great if you did an update skin care video. ☺
Any time you like something I just want to run out and buy it haha! I would love to see you review an affordable brand like Sleek or Nyx please, for those of us who need to rely on cheaper products most of the time...
Would love to know what you think about the new Nars Luminous weightless foundation and how best to apply it!
What colour foundation did you go for Nic?
I have always loved you!!! Been a subscriber to your channel since your PixiCut hair days! But I love more how excited you get when you show in the products that would look great for darker skin. ❤️
I have to be honest, the contour looked very muddy! Maybe it was because of the lighting? Other than that, the cheeks and eyes looked gorgeous
its 2k 17 \ni cant recognize humans any more
Wasn't she menta shake the foundation first
I wanted to comment on how this has been the best review of the Fenty Beauty line, but everybody has already said it. This is why I've trusted Sam and Nic for years now. Their videos are so informative that they have helped me pick which MAC, Estee Lauder, and Clinique foundations would suit my skin type. Moreover, their reviews are so positive, it's always pleasing to watch them.
I wanted to love the foundation but it sank right into my pores with and without a primer. Good thing I only got a sample.
Would love a review on jefree star products. Thanks x
Out of all the Fenty Beauty reviews I have seen... I feel you were the most honest and transparent... but you guys always are.  💟  This was super informative... Thank u.  Well done!!
Love what you did here 🙌🏼❤️❤️ showing the versatile usage really helped me 😊
I love how even in low light you can see that Nic has really beautiful and well taken care of skin, not just throwing some moisturizer on like most gurus who sctually have awful skin without their 1000 watt, full coverage and filter trickery.
I think it's great that you did a full face using the highlighters as eyeshadow! Clever!
I love the look you did with it. I haven't seen anyone else use the highlighters as eyeshadow or lipstick
I like the way you do makeup - I don't understand contouring the forehead though.  It just looks like everyone has a dirty forehead.  You don't of course.
The foundation made me break out in little red spots (not pimples/active acne, almost like an allergic reaction as opposed to a breakout) but I really liked the way it looks when mixed with a luminous foundation for my dry skin - I used Koh Gen Do Aqua and the two seemed to play nicely together. If anyone's bought the foundation but has dry skin and finds it isn't working but also own a liquidy dewy foundation try mixing the two!
I have really dry skin and the formulas just did not work for me. I got the foundation as soon as it was released because of the color selection. I have a strong yellow undertone that is hard for me to match. The foundation and primer just made my skin look even dryer. I looked like I had more texture then I actually have.
Celebrity make up . I shall pass
Please review Le Mètier de Beautè. I am very curious on your feedback for a high end brand.

Hi Nic, nice Fenty Beauty review!\nSince you asked, would you please consider reviewing Kjaer Weis products?\nThanks a lot and keep up the good work,\nEve from France
I really like the look of the blotting powder. can it be used as a setting powder?
absolutely love you so much!
Brilliant video. Would love you to review the new Bobbi Brown exclusive to selfridges sparkle palette. X
a glossier video would be amazing seeing as they just started shipping in the UK!!✨
You made these products look fantastic on dry skin. I’m returning the foundation. It settled into my fine lines and dry patches.
Glossier! I would love a review of that.
Such a pretty look!  Great tutorial!
I love how you used the shimmer sticks and powder highlighters on your eyes, the finished result is stunning! X
Very nice review, as usual! But I think the ones you called eyeshaddows are not eyeshaddows but highlighters.. obviously you can wear them as a eyesahddows as well but just saying :)
I would love to see the NARS Man Ray collection reviewed! :)
I’ve been in love with nic for years love all your work
It’s so refreshing to see a tutorial with ‘real’ lighting instead of 4 ring-lights making everyone look pale and doesn’t show the true pigments of the makeup. \nThanks Nic, brilliant job 😘 xo
Could you do a review on clinque beyond perfecting foundation and concealer in one please love to know your thoughts on it. Great video as always
Come onnnnn you must have said “ginger minge” by accident just once
I found that the power highlighters looked cakey on my (normal/oily) skin. They swatch beautifully on my arm, but it looked like a clump of power sitting on top of my cheek bones. I used different brushes, my finger, sprayed my brush with setting spray, applied less product, etc. but no matter the technique I used, it always yielded the same result. I'm surprised so many people liked it. The formula was way too chalky for my liking.
Ive been waiting for this for so long!!!
Oh man. I was waiting for your review forever on Fenty Beauty and I REAAAAAALLY wanted to like this but I think it just didn't work :( a lot of mixed reviews on the products. Still prefer the VB Estee Lauder one you looked gorgeous on there :)
Fabulous Nic 😘😍 Absolutely love yours and Sam's tutorials 💕
This was a very fun show of the collection, im a bit surprised that you managed to put out a completely unique video after the craze of release, everyone was doing the same thing initially. It's funny, i didnt think about it initially, but a lot of these colors are very spring/summer to me, they look a bit odd going into fall
I so appreciate the more natural lighting, Nic.  I think many of us feel alienated when we watch videos where the person's skin texture is totally bleached out.  You still look absolutely gorgeous, but you look human.  Beautifully so. X
Please review Dolce & Gabbana makeup! Thank you!

Great lightning!
lighting is a little bit dark!
You knew you’d be applauded for making special mention of men and makeup. Nothing is stopping men from wearing makeup. I came here like most, to relax and watch a makeup tutorial. Instead it’s like everywhere else you turn- politically charged and obsessed with political correctness at every point where it can be mentioned.
I am sorry, English is not my first language. Can someone please explain me what does 'break my foundation down' mean?  T^T
I don't think this was fair review. You said you adjusted the lighting so we could see what the makeup really looks like on your skin, you normally have bright lighting so perhaps you should adjust the lighting so we can what every product you review really looks like on your skin.
I watched this video to try and understand my anxiety. Now I ish understand it but now I'm terrified of it. Fml
Was recently diagnosed with severe reoccurring Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder and I didn't even think I had anxiety to begin with. My day to day life is a lot better now since treatment.
So thats why white people make me nervous...
I was hoping this would be a fun cartoon, its more of a drawing thang tho...
This video just gave me anxiety
I get anxiety when I'm in line and the cashier gives me coins.
Started meds after 1st and biggest anxiety attack. It stopped the constant anxiety the 1st attack triggered but i didnt want to be on meds my whole life so i weened off it after like 6 months and started probiotics and eating better which helped some but the biggest help so far has been magnesium spray. Ive only been using it a week but its helped a lot. Apparently magnesium deficiency is hard to diagnose in blood work so worth a shot.
does any one know how I could make a video with this similar kind of style? any free programs or tutorials any one knows of?
I honestly wish people treated mental illnesses the same as physical illnesses. Just because it may be invisible doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It can be just as debilitating or worse. \n\n- a girl trying to cope with GAD/MDD
Read turtles all the way down for a deeper look inside anxiety and the disorder itself
Excuse me but your brain picture with the hypothalamus and amygdala is totally wrong. Everyone knows that they're part of the limbic system and that the hypothalamus lies just below the thalamus duh. I feel offended that you would even allow this into your video hmmpf.
Anxiety is  basically just excitement with low self confidence. I don't have any science, but if you think about it it makes perfect sense. I would assume that it's different for people with disorders
Got lost in the comments and then heard them talking about rats and strawberries and was like, what does this have to do with anxiety?!
When you drew the muscle I thought it was an almond.
Could you guys do a video on Social Anxiety?
I eat weed to combat it
Can u make a video about why are you suicidal. My friend is and I want to know scientific ways to help.
*insert all the self diagnosed people*
I will make it.
Why are you anxious? “Well it depends....”\nOh wait wrong channel...
This video gave me a panic attack
Why could I hear the ASAPscience background tune in the thumbnail?
Because we are a social species being raised in an individualistic society. CBT is total crap. This science is flawed.
_[Jesus said] But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. _*_Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you._*_ Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid._ \nJohn 14.26-27
They tortured a mouse in the name of science so bad that even it's descendents were born in fear.😠
2:03 Over five yeeaarss (voice crack) lol but for real love you guys
I hate test anxiety, I have D’s in two clases
This is my first vlog and It couldn't relate to me any better! Thank you for sharing this and I'll be doing the same on my Facebook page. \nAlso, new subscriber!
OCD is awful. It's not life destroying for me but still causes much anxiety and more so eats up time. Some people must have it real bad - I have actually heard of extreme cases and the effects.
I had my FIRST anxiety attack yesterday at my school dance when I told my friend who I wanted to ask to the dance and he told on of her friends. I don’t really want her to know I like her
3:30 say it louder for the people in the back
Do a vid on being drunk and on xanax at the same time
Im always... Always panic because of school , im always afraid of what im i going to do to build my future , by studying and such... For example if i put a long term goal of having a PhD , i get anxious of what im i going to do to reach it... The hours i have to put in it , its like i have to breath books and infos to reach there... , im afraid i can't get the percentage required to get into a good university....
School makes everything worse for kids like me. Most the time I'm pretty good at acting confident and like I know what I'm doing. But when it comes down to final exams or anything major it freaks me out. But since I know why I'm anxious I've been able to stay confident almost all the time.
In my school we have this thing on Fridays called star of the week and each teacher picks a child from there class for good work or something like that. Whenever that happens I sit there and my heart is pounding and one time it was so bad I felt horrified (that's basically all the time that I'm horrified) to be chosen even though it's a good thing. (it might be a panic attack) but it also happens when we do class assembly's, When I have to speak. 😣😰
I learn the best way to tame my anxiety is to suppresses emotional feeling or expression
A know this should not be the answer that people or infact kids should hear but when my anxiety hits the roof happen I take valium or xanax and it takes it all away but I don't abuse them I only take them whèn needed
just had a panic attack, happy you decided to talk about this ^^
Because it's trendy
Because Donald Trump is president.
Why would evolution lead us to have feelings of being anxious? it doesn't help in fact it makes it more difficult because the last thing you want to do is feel anxious in the wild which will kill you
Thoughts from people on using mushrooms to stop anxiety? Also anyone have any thoughts on low dosing oxytosin to treat? SSRI is a no go. It's not for me but a loved one.
Fought my brain all afternoon & evening. 😭😫😰🤧And I don’t normally cry. Thought I could go off my SNRI. Panic attacks from NK & losing pets.
I have non stop GAD and have panic attacks more often than i'd like, it sucks.
Do a Chronic Pain video
Pretty simple. Capitalism screwing us over and reading social media and internet comments way too much.\nIf we got off social media and all had fulfilling jobs and could afford what we needed to survive, anxiety would pretty much disappear.
just relax..listen to music.. catch new vid monsters Ball https://youtu.be/UI6ReevSTtE
Could you do a whole video on the science of therapy?
Could you talk about ADHD in children and adults?
Why are you anxious?\nMe: Well...\n*Unravels scroll and watches it roll through the door like my hopes and dreams did*

Science, that's why
i was Anxious to click on the video to learn why i am Anxious

I’m anxious to find the answer
Thank you for this video. It's nice to have an explanation that I can understand on why I am the way I am.
2:01 In a study on nearly 300 people over 3 YeArS
Or you just tell your doc you're anxious & can't focus to get get xans & addys to pay rent.. That's what a lot people are doing unfortunately.
I have anxiety because of 4G signals.
Why i have anxiety\n\n1. Women\n2. People
I have Anxiety
People get anxious because we were never meant to live the way we do.
I had really bad anxiety throughout the 5th grade. I almost threw up during a test and didn’t come to school the next day because i was so nervous of how others would react to me throwing up. I had a music audition and almost passed out while playing violin. Luckily, I’m better now. Still have some anxiety in me but not as bad.
2:03 his voice tho
You would be if you have got a high school exam to worry about in the next few weeks.\n*HSC* Anyone?
why do we cringe to certain sound? ...like fingernails on a chalkboard. even the thought of it makes me cringe so hard
Anxiety is a personal bodyguard, that prepares for dealing with a threat.
Did anyone hear him have a voice crack at 2 minutes and 4 seconds saying years?
Funny how I'm anxious about my upcoming exam and I'm watching a video on anxiety! Exam anxieties are worse! 😣
This man just told me how I feel all The time And how i GOT it

Americans are good people. They have no aggressions against us and they like us as we like them. They must know I don't hate them. I love them. I hear it is a complex society inside. Many Americans don't know about the outside world. The majority have no concern and no information about other people. They could not even find Africa on a map. I think Americans are good, but America will be taken over and destroyed from the inside by the Zionist lobby. The Americans do not see this. They are getting decadent. Zionists will use this to destroy them.\n\nAmericans are good people. They have no aggressions against us and they like us as we like them. They must know I don't hate them. I love them.

Sometimes I feel bad for Macklemore cause noone says his name right
Eminem is cringe, he was best staying in hiding.

I have deleted scenes on my channel too :D
You know your terrible when even Rappers feel comfortable mocking you
out of touch middle class, funny
Aw man, I was expecting them to honk more and Eminem would tell them Fuck You! What a missed opportunity
Eminem being used by Hollywood to distract people from being disgraced by Harvey Weinstein.
All of these idiots saying Trump is unqualified because he hosted the apprentice and now they want an ex-addict washed-up rapper just because he agrees with them...has all logic been lost?
so now that em bashed Trump, the faggot left is cool with that. Back in the day I remember when Eminem ripped on homosexuals and was against exactly what's he's doing today. you cockroaches will never succeed in life and even after death. the joke is on you useless fucks.
will the real macklemore please stand up please stand up
eminem broke? (((they))) are getting desperate...
Why are those Black gentlemen just staying there? DEAD! 😂😂😂😂
When did Slim become parody of himself!! Edgy stuff LOL
Watch Trump tweet  loser eminem is failing and he has low ratings.
Who's Macklemore? Never heard of him.
Im really glad that guy is working for Colbert. He was one of my favorites on Conan
I have no clue what I just watched.
I wanted the horn beep to be timed to censor some of the lines with cussing in them, that would've been fantastic. You missed your one shot, and that opportunity comes once in a lifetime
That's no Macklemore, that Vanilla Ice obviously! The nerve of some people...
True, Em is eerily quiet on Trump compared to Bush.
Come on now, that ain't Mackelmore... that's Dan Smith from BYU.
i get that it was scripted but what the fuck was this??
Subsribe me i will subscribe i back
Woah, woah, woah.... Slim shady, take a rest, old man. Catch your breath before you keel
Oh look Fake Fox News is not getting that covered !

Dammmmmm throwing that shade

BRUH! This freestyle have Trump supporters, you knowcloset racist so mad. They calling him everything but a child of god. That goes to show you like Trump said QOUTE: I can shoot a man in broad daylight and not lose 1 supporter might even gain a few. Trump called men expressing there rights sons of bitches but has yet to condemn the Las Vegas mass murderer if PEOPLE TRUMP supporters is the problem they will not call Trump out on one of his lies! That my people is SCARY ASF? He even lost the VOTE but all you hear is he won? That's like the Patriots winning the Super Bowl but lose cause the NFL P.A. said no we're giving it to the Browns JUST CAUSE. This my folks is why we should not vote next election everyone in America cause obviously they gone pick the candidate who will distract the American's the most why they do there dirty work.
My comment was NOT edited
I was waiting for Stephen's reaction to this 😂
My apologies for the long post... had to get a few things off my chest.\n\nStill can't understand (for the life of me) how/why Black folks are quick to take knees; whine about Republicans/Conservatives/Trump/Police; how poorly (they think/feel) 'The White Man' is/has been treating them (while begging for their attention) and White Supremacy but quickly OVERLOOK ALL of THAT whenever they get the attention they CRAVE/BEG for from White People. \n\nThese fickle Black folks will show love to ANY/EVERYONE who panders to their feeble 'struggle/opression' Group Hive think and will IMMEDIATELY vilify/try to destroy anyone (other Black folks included) who break away from that fatuous mentality and/or chooses to think for themselves... Damn shame.\n\nOne last thing... These athletes/celebrities who constantly whine about the POTUS are weak. Whenever they're given an opportunity to meet him face-to-face to address their concerns, they act like BRATS, refuse to meet with him (runaway) and choose (INSTEAD) to name-call/disrespect him on social media. ALL because it's cool and will get them clicks; likes; retweets; reposts; followers and attention. They're NOT role models/revolutionaries/leaders, they're 'Hive Think' FOLLOWERS and COWARDS.\n\nThey're not looking for solutions to problems, they're looking to stay in the good graces of their 'Group Think' peers and fans. All they do is WHINE about 'stuff' (built upon emotions) but FAIL to BRING LOGICAL SOLUTIONS to ANY of it. \n\nKneeling about 'stuff' (WITHOUT ACTUAL LOGICAL SOLUTIONS) DOES NOT bring about solutions it just brings about attention to kneeling.\n\nHow about we focus on teaching our children to become doctors; lawyers; scientists; engineers; teachers; public officials; police officers; fire fighters; politicians; business owners; entrepreneurs and the like INSTEAD of Entertainers (i.e. Rappers; Actors; Athletes and the like)?\n\nHow about we teach and show the IMPORTANCE of education, ownership and growing LEGALIZED wealth in order to better one's self, family and/or community?\n\nHow about we WORK to improve our neighborhoods? How about we demonize/vilify the drug dealers, gang members and people (INSIDE) who are ACTIVELY/CONSTANTLY/DELIBERATELY DESTROYING our communities? How about we WORK/FIGHT to remove THEM?\n\nNAW... Let's keep kneeling and blaming EVERYONE ELSE INSTEAD. YEAH, that makes MORE sense; that's the solution.\n\n'Butthurt' Group/Hive Think individuals... Feel free to childishly insult me with You Bitch Ass Nigga; House Nigga; FuckBoy; Race Traitor; Coon; Token; Troll; Black Impersonator; White Boy; Agent and/or whatever insult I forgot in 3... 2... 1...

That's what I looking for #whateverittakes😘
First heard this song while playing Madden 18, it's the best song in the game.\n\nIt's also the first time I had heard a song from the band, but I think I had heard their name somewhere.  I'm telling the truth, I only listen to the music on my ipod, I don't listen to radio or music on tv.  I find all my new music through other media or general internet use.
i love all ur songs😙
JUST got out of their denver concert- daniel was wearing this cat shirt and seemed very offended when dan didn’t realize the shirt even existed.
always in love with Dragons
I wonder In the making of the video when there equipment was on fire we're they like: this is awesome or we're they more like damn this is hut let's finish this quickly.
I love you so much.... your songs have helped me through a lot and each song you make was just amazing and when I saw your concert\nI cried 😂

Love watching you’re videos. They always make me smile and laugh till my belly hurts. Lol keep it up Nile! 😁
Another absolute phenom vlog!  I literally cannot get through a Nile vlog without a giant grin on my face.  Him and his friends/family just bring so much joy to everyone.
Cracking comeback after the injury, mate. Was rooting for you and delighted to see you made the world championships. Looking forward to see much more of your journey, Nile.
Honestly, I need a GIF of you and your dad dancing 😂🙌🏼
So happy for you Nile, just found out your channel today! It feels strange to see all these talented people reunited in my hometown but at the same time it's great!\nCongrats again for both the finals and how you pushed through this year~

We could hear your dad yelling Nile. every time you competed all the way back to the  USA. lol.    We could hear him yelling Nile in the back ground of other gymnasts in the go.  \nYou must be one man-of-steal, coming from the back of the pack to the top 8.  Congrats.
So happy for you, keep up the amazing work.
Dude! Caught you on the coverage. Surprised my dad knowing stuff about men's gymnastics. It's all down to you! I know the scoring system and also how far you've come! Didn't know that 3 months ago and it's all down to you!!

I always wondered what that thing is in his intro. Is it a computer mouse or something???
It's possible to start gymnastic at 16 years?
I won National for Taekwondo and I’m in Kang’s Taekwondo. Now I’m National champion,but I can’t go to world because I’m not old enough. I’m only 8 and I’m supposed to be 12!
Nile I’m state champion in gymnastics Australia,Queensland
Is it just me or do Nile and Max not get along?
Congrats Nile! Killing it and inspiring. I actually liked this time though cos of Purvis' freestyle.
Nile how did you like Canada? And did you like us Canadians?
Looking at the classification, Nile matched the winning score for the horizontal bar, so would've shared the gold had he qualified and produced his same performance? Am I reading that right?
Nile, where do you live? I went overseas recently and your accent suddenly came to my mind, not sure why xD
I'm weak and skinny so how do I get started???
May I ask, do you know Epke Zondeland? He's a gymnastic from the Nehterlands. I'm also from the Netherlands 😅😂🇳🇱🇳🇱
Who tf is this guy?
What does it take to have a physic like yours Nile? Diet, training routine, and cost?
Oh I thought this was about drugs like cocine, meth or others
We should get rid of the current education system and instead replace them with a movie like experience, where all the students get like ridiculously comfy chairs, a big screen with everyone in front of it, popcorn or snacks of any kind with drinks, and just play minute earth and minute physics videos. Guarantee you this, whatever the official number is for the amount of students that succeed through their lives will skyrocket compared to how it has been. An 8 year old could watch this and learn without confusion. This world is very far behind where it could already be, people like the people here at minute earth are what we need.
my plug, Kevin. shoutout to him
Easy drugs come from hell
Yes, the University of Minnesota is a major source of knowledge regarding medical research (I will get treatment there for chronic tmj)
penecilin dosnt exist anymore... newer and newer antibiotics have to be made all the time because with every new antibiotic comes resistance and adaption by the bacteria. Good luck this will be a massive problem eventually and everyone will get infected.
God like all things
I already have the smelly socks one :P
This was a waste....
In another universe, fungi and bacteria are taking Guns and Nuclear Weapons to treat their infections of humans.
So live in forest and start pharmacy!
My dealer usually makes me jerk him off, but never gives me the drugs. Why is that? He even pinky promised.
When theyre really imported from government officials
I thought you were gonna tell us ur dealer

Don't get me wrong, I like Kate's voice, but there's something... unusually high and squeaky about it. Does the recording software not do her voice justice? Or does she really sound like a chipmunk?

Who needs diversity of organisms, when we have greed and capitalism to produce shit we don't even need but get it anyway, and in the process destroy the said organisms and the environment. Go selfish desires!.. aka FREEDOM!!

Please make a follow up video to talk about both the positive and negative consequences of the use and SALE of “drugs.” Can’t be just all pretty..
And you people kept watching the shit that Hollywood makes and you call them “real movies”
Funny how everyone seems to think this Harvey thing will help put an end to the sickness that is Hollywood....ahhh no it won't,because you same people still buy and watch their garage....iam proud to say i don't....its all shit.Even if Harvey does properly go under theres just another sick pedo to take hos place and you can bet on that.Fuck Hollywood hey!!
She's so ugly
Insert Morgan Freeman 'he's right, you know' meme here
Using the full range of MacFarlane expressions. Both of them. I mean, have you SEEN The Orville.
unbelievably sad that it's so normalized that they are joking and laughing about it. it's one coping mechanism to deal with the vile industry they are a part of.
One of the creepiest aholes in the business, called out the soon to be retired, creepiest guy in the business. Sounds like someone wanted Harvey's spot.
Alex Jones was right. What now bitches?

They laugh because they all knew, but since Seth is a creator he has the balls to say it. Other actors are worried about losing their jobs so they stay silent. They knew...
I mean 4 years ago we had YouTube. Yet this was never in news! Thanks to Wikileaks and people who are leaking hidden secrets.
I wanted to know who won bro
Weinstein been doing this kind of thing for years yet nobody, including and especially the women said shit because it might have affected their careers negatively, so they played the game. Hardly a position deserving of sympathy.
This proves that Weinstein's behavior was well-known in Hollywood. Nobody spoke up about rape because they're all profiting from keeping their mouths shut. They're all complicit.
And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.  Matthew 5:30\nAnd if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.  Matthew 18:9
Hollywood invented pornography.  Actors are just fucks for the paying director.  Advanced prostitutes.
Who even actually cares about this shit? Not a big deal
He's a fucking jew what do you expect
They all knew about it,i suppose with him taking the heat,all Hollywood producers will be ringing in favour s now
Holy sh*t. The worst part is the nervous laughter and Emma Stone's reaction. Seth has really really dark humour and is brutally honest at the same time
and they laughed? The problem was not only him! It was them all!
Hollywood is infested with sick and twisted satanic pedophiles! Do your research these hellyweird celebs are into some of the most sick things we can imagine. Wake up!
his facial expression says it all tbh
*TO THE 1% OF PEOPLE WHO SEE THIS*\nIf this gets 10 likes I will upload a person falling 200 metres and SURVIVING!!  COME CHECK IT OUT
Seth's face after.....that was not a joke
He made a joke about it, then never mentioned it again, so you can tell he was serious about pursuing justice.
They all knew, and did nothing!. Much facepalming, little surprise. This is SOP for the human race. It's a wonder we've made it this far.
Anyone that thinks he is the only one doing this , also believes in Santa Claus \nHollywood and the media is a wash with Pedophilia and sexual abuse, but if you want fame and fortune then you must sell your sole.\nYou also have the issues of Hollywood and the Media being owned by the Jews and there for if you say anything you are a anti-semite.\nLook at Mel Gibson  and what they tried but failed to do to him.\nBut grow up people every person with power abuse that power with sexual favours and then we act shocked when we hear they are Pedophiles ( Jimmy Savile, Bill Cosby, Harvey Weinstein, Cliff Richards the list goes on)  now go back to your safe comfortable live and let the rapes continue.
*WHY JUST THE INTERNET JUST NOTICED*
calls him out ? more like made a weak scared joke, and where is fuck head kimmel these days with his high and mighty self righteous bullshit which now seems to be hiding in his pants, all these low life fuckers march in lock step when the executives tell them,
You know Anne Hatahaway sat on that.
making a joke isnt calling out anyone. he knew weinstein was raping woman and he made a joke about it and never mentioned it again
fuck this harvey bitch lock him up and put him in gen pop
So woman cant act either. Hmm i knew they gave blow jobs for walmart manager positions, but not this.\nI am shocked and apalled
That means he knew about that rape, and didn't do anything about it, except downplay it as just flirting with Harvey.

KCNvREKTnQc,

KCNvREKTnQc,He should be ousted like everyone else who knew and did nothing.
How is this calling him out? He made a stupid joke, calling him out would be to really confront him hollywood hero eh.
Be quick and grab these free Cat paw gloves! Purrrfect for the cold weather! \n\nhttps://iwanttogetthat.com/products/cute-cat-paw-fingerless-gloves
Like how everyone took it as a joke - sometimes the best jokes come from real life situations 🙈
I love the movie silver linings playbook because of jlawwww
Ohh Smack. That should be the end of his company, who colluded to the point of having a  bad behaviour clause in his contract, so he wouldn't cost them money.
HIS FACE\nHIS FACE SCREAMS IT ALL
the fact that a lot of people knew about it already but just keeping quiet is even more disturbing
Harvey's nothing, we had Jimmy Fucking Saville.
I though Hollywood was the champions of women’s rights and so on.yet they joke about this kind of shit.
Ahhahaha.... Quick, move on before people think about it and start investigating!
Money talks, pedophiles walk. That's the way it goes. People are predictable when it comes to having/keeping a job, money, and even power.
I remember watching this some years back, and the thing I remember the most is the audience reaction. I was like, who the hell is harvey Weinstein? Now I understand why they reacted the way they did.
Change the game to six degrees of Harvey Weinstein and you'll quickly realize how many people knew and said nothing.
CLOCK IT IN THE HOUSE!
Oh wow!  How brave!  You only covered for him for 20 years you shitstain.
Seth proclained that he was supposed to have been on the first  plane that aledegly hit the North tower on 9/11 as did Mark Whalberg. Funny how FAA statistics show that said flight never took off that day & had actually been cancelled on 9/5. It's also hilarious that the wrong type of plane engine was recovered 4 blocks away under some scaffolding & bearing in mind the windows of the twin towers were only 18 inches wide, inspection of the north face of the south tower prior to collapse shows there was no exit hole large enough for said plane engine to evacuate.\nSeth also produced an episode of Family Guy which made multiple referencs foreshaddowing the fake Boston Marathon drill & an episode of American Dad which aired the night before the marathon made reference to 2 blasts.
I'm sorry but you're all dumb 😀
First time I saw Harvey Weinsteins face I knew he was a sleazy Hollywood guy. Joel Schumacher and Larry Clark too.
Forced smile after he says that lol
So every people in that room is complicit and as bad as he is. These people could have saved hundred of young girls from this but they cared to much about their own careers and cash to speak out. \nHollywood is a disgrace.
Was he raped as well? I can see this 6 wide three mile queue forming all going towards a Harvey raped me convention hall
If everyone knew, why did no one report it? Doesn't that count as complicity?
I love that Seth did this for his friend who had been assaulted by Weinstein. She confided in him and this was his way of telling him, I know what you're doing.
Ha, ha. ha. That's about as funny as making fun of date rape victims.  A really weak taking a stand against Weinstein.\nBuy hey, it's the 'Family Guy' guy.  A pretty ugly show where women are concerned so no big surprise there.
I don’t get it. Is this like a meme lol
So family guy is the new Simpsons in more ways than one.
this makes me sick to my stomach :( no one did a thing! no wonder so many celebrities go  'off the rails' can you imagine dealing with this and then having to keep it all hush just because its some powerful hollywood type and not what the media tells us a criminal looks like...
What sucks is that most likely the actors and actress that go off and look crazy are probably trying to get help from people.
It seems everybody knew about it but nobody would do anything about it and now that he's been called out on it everybody in their sister that's coming out with some kind of story where were they when all this was happening he has a piece of shit but that's besides the point.
GODDAMN thats not a burn, thats a fucking NUKE lol
https://youtubem.video/r/?xxYrOKyY9Hme7zh4=g5JNSMd8FzTqbkDzjVqVwp6g3ADTHj7NDtD9

OMG called it!

This mild joke is not calling him out
He knew. Didn't do a damn thing.
Proof the libt@rds like all the late night hosts knew about Weinergate yet did nothing. But hypocritically they go for an outsider like Trump. Im waiting for the pussyhats to come out again.
Seth Macfarlane and Russell Brand are my absolute 2 favourite celebrities OMG they are both so amazingly hilarious and straight up!!! <3 <3 <3 Thanks for being real Seth!!!
Haha every one of these rich whores have been tasting the guys cock for decades
What else can u expect from Zionist jew hollywood Elite weinstein? Typical crook. Its in their holy book.
Interesting, isn't it, that the so called shitlords like MacFarlane were the ones calling him out while all the pious folk did nothing and let it go on.
He sounds like Brian from family Guy holy shit

NC: This guy couldn't lure awkward fan art to Tumblr\nMe: I would not doubt that
This makes me want to see the Batman episode, almost got 'em.
So is Marcus as the I.T. guy suppose to be Richard Ayoade?
Um...I don't want to be that guy but It 2017 isn't really THAT overrated. It only has a 7.7 on imdb. You're acting like people are treating this new movie like Dark Knight and Shawshank Redemption. They really aren't. The overwhelming consensus is that the new movie is pretty decent.
Love your channel and the opening and the cast
So... I understand that this would have been a long time in the making, and was scripted and filmed a long time ago. But man, after Las Vegas that intro bit is really... oof.
...Why's Tim Curry's Pennywise got a British accent? Pretty sure he had a standard American accent in the miniseries. It's kinda distracting.
Well done with the It acting critic XD
You need to use the two versions of Pennywise again.
I don't think clowns are silly or scary so I have never really got them.
Am I the only one who got the batman reference.
I remember when NC used to be funny. then he started trying to make edgy jokes about current events... So glad cinemasscare is still around
Just saw the movie and I have to say the New Kids on the block stuff wasn't that bad it was mentioned twice.
I'm upset there wasn't a drinking game in this like the first It review
Why does henry bowers look like dog the bountt hunter
Now I'm really looking forward to part 2 of It more than ever.
What makes you mad and sad
I need to get my social life back.
Were you really too afraid of copyright infringement to use the Looney Tunes and Benny Hill theme? They’ve been on public domain for years now!
This was the funniest review in quite a while. Brilliant!
Hey Critic, I'm just curious, have you ever thought of reviewing any of the Harry Potter movies? It's fine if you haven't, just wondering
where is spongebob in the graveyard??
The cardboard cut out jew gets me eveytime. so fucking genius
the reference to the  ''who's on first'' comedy routine of Abbot and Costello during the credits was funny.
Can you review the Shawshank redemption?
That impression of the bill skarsgard It is actually pretty good
Oh please oh please oh please someone make a captioned GIF of And remember, if someone feels triggered, say hello to my trigger bi-otch!!! XD!!!
This is better than the movie
ROCK FIGHT! Pure gold, I literally laughed harder at that scene more than the fire dance.
I was ready to hate this review...but, wow, this was really great
This feels self-defeating.\nMalcolm always has the second best one-liners. Can't top Bill's though.
One of my favorite reviews
I liked the review but I found the beginning where Fan Girl shoots up the theater to be in very poor taste. Partly due to the Las Vegas shooting, but mostly because of the Colorado shooting in 2012. You could not have been ignoring that when you made the joke so it kind of feels like a parody of that event. Especially with the framing of a Batman sketch and the Colorado shooting being at the midnight release of the Dark Night Rises. I know this was finished before the Las Vegas shooting but still. I left this review thinking about shootings when I came here for comedy. 20 years ago that joke would have been funny, but now that its a real possibility it just feels gross. I'm disappointed.
I just love this. The scenes with the Tim Curry IT talking are particularly hilarious.
2017 IT is still better (not that thats really saying much)
the 2017 it keeps reminding me of a fucking rat painted like a clown. anyways why is this movie rated R it acts and feels like it's pg-13 I wasn't even scared just hungry and meeting my ass off, one more thing why do people say it's scary? why? when I walked out of the theater it was pouring down rain and the very second I was gonna run to my car a bolt of lightning went off in front of me, that was more scary than the while movie.
18:14 through 18:42 killed me! That was great! 😂👌
This is the non-spoiler version
Critic don't review Dispicable me if you do YOU WERE WARNED
the original Richie was played by Seth green and I like him.
wtf ok so why do they keep tryna day that 2017 pennywise was tryna be scary? he wasn’t saying he was scary ever. it was actually just like hey wassup ima eat you now.
Really great review. TOTALLY wish I could've seen it on the big screen.\n\nBut if I had one criticism, it would be that the Joker scene is a bit too cheap. I don't really care for the photoshop cartoons, but they've become such a staple of the NC, I tolerate them well enough. This was a Big Screen event. Up the ante a little, guys! They totally could've brought Andrew Kaiko on again to animate the Joker, and maybe even hired a guest voice actor like Xander Mobus to do an impression of the Joker. They have the money to outsource, don't they? In this case specifically, I think they could've and should've went the extra mile.\n\nOther than that personal gripe, I thought the review was great.
Is it just me or has this channel gone to shit
Doug is a really good impersonator
A nostalgia critic episode hasn’t made me laugh this much in so long
IT IS SUPPOSE TO BE A 90’S FILM YOU STUPE
why is this so gay
Using SF debris rules the Mass shooting at the beginning comes across as kind of tasteless given recent events.\n\nHaving said that I might be reading into that too much.
I love the Abbot and Castillo reference.
That slow motion part caused my dog to freak the fuck out.  X-D
this episode was brilliant
You should review a nightmare before Christmas
Doug or his Nostalgia Critic character seems to have a lot of trouble buying into the unexplained in horror movies. Gut emotional (or spiritual) reactions get mocked, which sucks, because the instinctive part of horror gets overlooked.\n\nIt's the one thing I really get annoyed by. Definitely more present in the original IT review though, or something like Event Horizon.
Plz do night in the museum movie
In the book don’t they all like gangbang Beverly or something like that?
This episode is freaking hilarious. Probably my favourite NC episode this year.
There's a movie from 2007 that I don't see anybody talk about. You can make fun of it a LOT for it's cheap cgi, bad story, and bland characters. It's called Dragon Wars.
its funny on how she shoot up the movie theater like a school :)
It's a good movie for me to be honest. I just liked it that's it
Wait wait, why is he bald? does reviewing shitty movies finally gave him cancer?
ahm..so in the end it was a good movie but you coud have done it lot better? or just a sarcatic review? well it was a nice critic but i could have done it better...huh? a paradox ...
I'd like to see him review the chipmunks at the movies...
Remember the old show old CD new...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMe neither.
The IT run looks like he’s jerking off 2 men in super Sayian mode
Without a doubt you guys have the best on screen chemistry that you can't find in any other channel out there. Constantly bouncing jokes off each other. The sort of guys that you could have do literally anything and still be funny. Congratulations and keep up this awesome work. Greetings from Romania!
I've actually read the book and I'm starting to wonder if the King secretly hates kids.
So basically... Old it... Funny.... New it.... Scary like how it's supposed to be with a demon clown.
i died at you hate Pixar, you despised Jurassic Park, you want to see officer Hopps die!
Whoa... apparently there is many comments with pretty good reasoning against Doug's opinion. The machinegun is for them too?
Nerd just kill me and im a 13 asshole nerdiac killer go kill yourself why don't you.
Please do an Old vs New of It!
High-Five on a million views!!
That voice at the beginning, Oh my god! that was Doug, so good.
Love the reverence to the Beverly fucks everyone scene in the book
That intro, Perfect timing with the Mandalay Bay incident.
Finally! Someone who has the same thoughts as me!
Wow, these deleted scenes are pretty good, did you get the VHS Special Edition?
Gotta say Critic you done very well with this review ^^
Opo ki film yyyyy
Youll flout to 🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈

Plz review Stephen kings insomnia movie
I kept on imaging this scenario, 'Pennywise meets Beavis & Butthead'.\nPennywise: Come down here, we all float down here.\nButthead: Heh heh heh, float,.... like a turd, you're in a sewer heh heh heh. Hey Beavis, this clown eats turds.\nBeavis: heh heh heh, yeah, turds.\nButthead: Let's feed him... I ate like a bunch of nachos, and...\nBeavis: Diarrhea cha cha\nPennywise runs

Beard guy shaking it was the best thing ever! 🤣
This song doesn't get old does it ❤
Best Hey Ya! cover to date
There was a time this group really had s chance.  Then they added Sarah and went in such s shit direction focusing more on 'cute YouTube videos then dope original music
I cant even lift my leg that high let alone have that much focus
one of the most creative, if not the most, music covers I have ever seen
It is possible that this is the best thing you've ever created. Which is really really saying something.
This is amazing. Right on guys!!
Been watching you guys for many years and you never disappoint and this was outstanding!!!
I love the energy that goes into these videos! stay awesome!
I seriously need to have a long hard think about my life, how did I get here? And why do I love this?.... Fuck...
You are great friends !! I really love you! And I think you're just getting better, and I like the way you're going. You're so good. Yes..!! Show the world what you can do best !!

Hey, you people are having way to much fun! : )
They filmed it with slow motion audio then sped it up. Fake and not live.
I want too see the bloopers of this video 🤣🤣
I wish there was a love button!
I lost it when the puppets appeared.

This is brilliant!! How many takes did this take you guys??
I love you guys! This video was amazing!!!

Beard guy do shake it. 🎼Now shake it, shake it, shake it...🎶🎵
Unbelievably creative and fun! - 502 people obviously would rather watch paint dry.... (?)
Is that her hair or wig?? anyways amazing cover though!!!
No. Massive descrace to the legend Andre 3000. Trump should ban this.
Wh- what da heck how that's frigin nuts and impressive
500 people didn't like this?
I just heard the bump sound after that dancing man jumped out 😂 that made me laugh so hard
Done in one! Just one shot, awesome. I liked and subscribed. Thanks for the smile.
Awesome!! Made me Smile on a crappy day, Thnx :D
THIS IS WHAT IM HERE FOR
Thats fun and art... Great...
Seriously, as close together as you get on your videos you all ought to have a deodorant company sponsor you. Win, win.
Woooww... i'm from indonesia..
Y’all don’t wanna hear me you just wanna dance
Does anyone know what speed they actually record at? Curious how that makes it harder. Clearly they speed up the video to make it seem like real time but they perform it at much slower speed.
This is soooo entertaining! I smiled all the way. Thank you wote! Bless ya'll.
This video is so funny and cute♥♥
They always get better. Never disappointed.
That was awesome !! I love how you work out the choreography
You're making people think white people are super happy 24/7
This is just insane, you are the best, please come to France again soon ! Amazing video, thank you for your infinite creativity, you made my day
wtf did i just watch ewwwwwwww
This is so fucking white
“White people have no culture”
Amazing! Thank you very much @Walk off the Earth! ;)
Great !!! Dave Gahan & Kurt Uenala are fantastic !
Sounds like playing the angel song, absolutely nice.
Just what I needed on a Friday night! Does anybody hear this man singing? His voice is mesmerizing!
Really good! Love his voice
my Sun, my God, Wonderful\n<3
Absolut Perfect
Dave could sing the ABC Song with this soft voice and it would sound sexy to me...wonderful song...pure electronic 🎹
The Fucking voice of Electronic music
I don't need another Soulsavers album with Dave, I want new electro project with him !!! This song is simply perfect.
OMG I LOVE THIS MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Amazing😍😍
The voice of a God!
Put Gore behind and you have the Depeche from 87-89-93. Sounds really great and very well produced!
OmG💙 Gahan one of the most beautiful voices ever !
Holy shit, how fucking good was that.
DAVE GAHAN is a music god, a champion with no one else in his league! Just as good with his solo projects as with Depeche! He's the best!
Great song. Love it!
This is so good!!!
This sounds like And One and Depeche Mode had a baby! Amazing!!
Отлично, Дэйв!!!
Awesome!
Magnifique!!!
Love it
J'adore 🎵🎶🎤🎶🎵
♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥\n♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥\n♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
Amazing! Dave should be the front. It’s different then Depeche Mode by tons. This is the future
What the sound, what the powerful song was this. It will be becoming more popular  than i think.
Your words were spoken Carefully chosen For me Each one a msg And insight To some degree   When I wake up My eyes are open I can see I can hear you All around me I feel free   There is comfort here Where I wait For you There is sunlight Shining through There is comfort here Where I wait For you There is sunlight Shining through   Why am I nervous My hands they're shaking My heart it beats Your specter haunts me And taunts me I can't breathe   When I wake up My eyes are open I can see I can feel you All around me I can breathe   There is comfort here Where I wait For you There is sunlight Shining through There is comfort here Where I wait For you There is sunlight Shining through   We're moving on We're moving on
I loved them a long time ago but fuck me! As pretentious and as same as an album full of DM songs as you are ever going to find.😴
Electronic Music brought me here ✨
Masterpiece guys ! This is it !!!
wow amazing song with felling dark i love
Sounds like real synthy Depeche Mode, but here is very feeble non-catching refrain.
This Sound is very deep. \nThe Beat is very dark.  \nSometime we need dark and deep things in our Lifes.  \nBut if you sell yourself into the Darkness, you will never be the same Person anymore. It's your Choise, when you even sell your whole body and soul to the Darkness. Sorry Dave Gahan, but this is not my music and not my World. Satanic, Diobolic, whatever. Not every deep music is so dark like this Song, but l will only listen to the beauty of music itself. You have dissapointed me.
This sounds like a B side from the SOTU record that should've been the first single 😐😧😳SHEEEEEEZE that was good
is it trevor or something
Geeeez!!! The verse is absolutely AWESOME!!! That silky voice.... gwaaaashh..... so mesmerizing ❤ Lyrically haunting, perfectly suited to the dark quality of the music 👍 great job guys! I find the chorus a bit weak, but I get the idea of contrasting atmospheres verse and chorus convey. The video IS creepy, but, again, it suits the tone. Strangely, what Saccenti says is not my interpretation, but he is the director, so I bet he knows best 😁.
The real DM sound. Thank U !  Great song,, I'm waiting to buy the whole CD
LYRICS pleae. I love this song
Absolut Perfect voice of Electronic music
More Depeche like than the whole spirit album
Best DM song in years!! Ops... :D
What a magical Song!! Kurt Uenala and Dave Gahan are a wunderful Team for pure electronic music
and THIS is what I expect DM music to sound like. perfect electronic stuff!
I have an absolute obsession with this song, I have no words  awesome
Great! I would like to be the deep underwater dancer for the next Dave Gahan video!!!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Coh2Pwj6H6k
I just love it!!!!!!
gorgeous and very sexy melody to this! i just saw depeche mode at the hollywood bowl and this fulfils my post concert sadness lol great stuff :)
I really love this track. If I didn't know I could have sworn that this is a Depeche Mode single!! So good absolutely!!

Love it Dave Gahan  the master voice.
Pretty nice and peaceful song. Especially the voice of Dave Gahan too, makes this even better 🎶
I love Dave Gahan and the versatility of his deep dark Baritone 😍. However, i do not like the video at all (saved only by the shots of Dave himself) . Disturbing....but not in a good way. I shall just close my eyes and listen............
love at first sight. :)
Fucking amazing. Dave still got it.
why not in the spirit album?
Spectacular video, I love it, and well Dave, as always so flawless, is a pleasure to hear ... and watch it .... @ beautiful!
Они не умеют делать плохую музыку и все тут! - They can't make a bad music and thats all! 
KOOL!
ДЭЙВ РУУУЛИИИТТТ!!!!!
Очень похожа на Precious! Luxury music.
Love it ....
Very nice indeed!
Neo noir atmosphere.
Great song!
Impresionanteeeee!!!!!!! ♡
Fantastic!
What's the matter with all these morons commenting on Dave's demonic side because of the video??!!? Are you f..ing crazy?? 1) Dave has nothing to do with the concept of the video 2) his voice is a gift from God for all of us who have a soul 3) with what he's been through, no one - NO ONE - has any right to comment on his personal life 4) anyway, WHO CARES about moral implications??? Just listen and appreciate the music for what it is. Long Live Dave <3 And thax Kurt!
Fantastic performance Dave 👏👏❤❤❤❤❤❤😍\nYour voice is a gift from God \nThanks to Exist Mr Dave Gahan \nLong life to you
Perfecto love this song 🤙🏻👌🏻
♡
Perfect! Thanks Kurt+Dave+Tim Team
Nice job. Perfect
Veľmi profesionálne spravene👍
Very Good!
Świetny kawałek...

Słucham i słucham całkiem to dobre
Not bad, but to be honest: The song doesn't really have a peak.
I WANT THEM TO DO ANOTHER ALBUM LIKE SOUNDS OF THE UNIVERSE..  or another song like fragile tension or in symphony they really need to go back to that sound or speak and spell to bring the 80's sound back at least one song like dreaming of me that was a real good song
worst song of 2017
Klingt ein bischen wie And One. Geil aber nicht einzigartig. Da wird sich doch wohl der Meister nicht etwa was von einem seiner größten Fans etwas abgeschaut haben...?
Que video tan horrible !
Dave genual!!!!! Mais no me gusto la violencia del video!!primera vez en mil años.que no quedo contenta.
are you ppl all crazy? i think that if dave sing about raping your mother youll like it too bcs its dave...you are all sick, really! i loved dm, been fan 30 years but these is just weird...very weird...if you like what you see in this video then you must be very sick in your head or very evil...dave already sold his soul to devil...thats why hes still alive otherwise he wont be here ya know...get ur shit together ppl...and THINK!
The video is ugly. The shots of Dave are nice but all the nonsense with the actors is just boring and unpleasant. Videos have gotten cheap but they should have found a decent idea for this. The song itself is okay but it doesn't go anywhere. The chorus is not very different from the verse and it's not soaring or moving. It's better than the entire Spirit album, IMO. That album is just unlistenable - and believe me I tried several times. Maybe David should stick to working with Soulsavers.
too satanic...dont like it at all....
Love Pink. Her voice is amazing.
My life has been restored.
Wish he would have done this song when i saw him at soldier field  this summer!
He's pregnant with a food baby. And he sounds awful.
I love axel but he could’ve done a better job hiding his fake whistling
Pink had to Fuck it Up
Two in the Pink, One in the stink.
pink sucks D!ck... Ohhhh people you know she does
They're STILL milking this thing?
glad guns and roses are still rocking..loving Pink
Just so glad to say i was there!
ok. am I the only one here who thinks this is an insult to rock and roll? THIS IS THE WORST VERSION IVE EVER HEARD!!!
Pink stinks, semen was definitely gargled on this day..
That is so cute! Pink just had another baby recently  and it looks like Axl is due any day now!
Seriously she does not give herself enough credit cuz she's amazing and I think it's a shame and a travesty that she is not as popular in the US as she is in other parts of the world - like especially Australia!!! I've seen so many interviews of other artists - I specifically remember Kelly Clarkson saying that too!!! P!NK can do anything, and the sky is the limit for her, and I LOVE how she keeps stretching that limit - pushing it higher and higher!?! Pink is totally setting the bar so high that she said this morning on an interview that she has no idea what she's going to do next and the interviewer suggested like her getting shot out of a cannon and she seriously said that someone actually mentioned that as a suggestion and I can't wait and see cuz she's so great I love how real she is with the kids and totally blunt and honest and speaks the truth of what's really going on in this world, and how she feels about it, and how it's affecting the world  Here and Now - and how she's terrified for the future for her kids and everyone else's kids as well!?! Such a great and meaningful mom comment that is so natural within her!?!💖
I used to love this guy but why do I get the impression that he's just going through the motions. \nOn the bright side Pink was good !
Nobody Does that end in As Good As axel
Even stars get star struck.. Good stuff thanks for posting.
She sings slower than the rhythm
last note! thats fucking axel, right therer, right then, right now! fucking A man! like kurts from unplugged
Shit Axl got fatter since the beginning of the tour. Thought he did drop some weight when I saw him live in Paris back in July; but right now he seems fatter. I don't know if it's the food or alcohol, but he really should get some rest, thoses bastards have been touring for more than a year and you can clearly see that his voice is in pain, he starts to sound like Mickey Mouse again... Shame because only 3 months ago, Paris show was fucking amazing.
i wanna see guns n roses play their rare songs live like axl's blues, crash diet (it was suppose to be on their first album, appetite for destruction), and heartbreak hotel.

I must listen to this about a 100 times already 100% heavy damage this is a lot better than Bugsy Malone song didn't rate his new one
I don't thumbs up many vids but this is one that gets it shit is dope defo do another
Jehovah is God's name.
Love from MONTREAL CANADA FAM. I don’t even mess with grime like that but the way he promoted this is genius, beautiful, pure and relatable.
Each to there own but for me Another reason to dislike British music.
That is hard AF
6:15-6:34 his bomber jacket is straight fire. Wonder where I can cop his jacket.\n\nAnyways,\nGreat film from Stomzy about the life and death in the hood in the UK (where he grew up).
he's come so far
What's the first song called
Best and most influential video for this generation
Whoever be dislikin this is on some heavy crack
Mum deserve all the 100 bags .ghanaian queen indeed bless her.ghana is always winning 🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭
VERY AWAKENING. VERY WELL EXECUTED. THANK YOU.
What's the first song that played?
pulled at my heart, many grime(& rap obv) artists have spoken about life on the streets but the way Stormzy breaks it down is undeniable. Big up yourself for keeping it really real <3
yo, the fucking second beat, the orchestral one, it is outta this world.. surely the instrumental is out there somewhere? anyone got it? fucking gassed
My man basit main kid in this damn well in G
Luv this, nice job! Would've liked a longer, focused film with more depth, details and showing the climb to success. A more diverse cast would have been 👌 Powerful, necessary, poignant message that (I hope) will hit home for those who need it. Congrats to all involved with this project. Salute!!
stormzy release this song as a single so I can listen to this all the time som1 do it plz
Stormz we need a movie man!!!
This message very much needed to be told
why isint this number one on trending youtube make it happen
I'm 9ja made and I'm Michael 😏👊🏾
Your the dark the light the dark knowledge
Stromzy May Allah bless you and your family Ameen , I'm a mum I showed it to my son and my nephew please keep up The good work and I love the way in end you showed love to your mum your mum is luck women may Allah bless her Ameen
Oasis made rock n roll \nStormzy MADE Grime ! \n\nFucking epic on so many levels
Lukaku is on top. Whats the bald man doing in the barbershop?
more of a long music video than a film
When KSI and Lukaku have a child
Jheez, what a role model this man is. GQ man of the year? No-one came close....
One  of   the best films I have ever seen that combines the blood of the street with the spirit of philosophy. Who  Jah bless...tindrum13
Wow this will explode. This is amazing.
Much love from the states fam

*I like your style Yoongi :))*
As a YoonGi biased, I feel  attacked
the only thing better than jin and V having headbands if is V's was a naruto headband or something anime/manga ish. lol
JHope really stands out in this song for me, he's not even my bias but he really kills this song. Also Suga is totally sexy at 1:00

I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk

why did the Vatican build the world's largest infrared telescope and name it Lucifer? BC it's almost home. Planet x is the depopulation method. Oceans are receding BC the earth is tilted. This monster is tugging on our shoulder. Look for yourself. Use your platform to warn people.

An interesting and fun application of what is known as a Kelvin Probe.\n(Physics geeks could use a bit of maths to calculate the displacement of the mirror at each frequency)\n\n532nm laser pointers often are pulsed with a pulse width of around 1ms or so. This would explain the multiple strokes in your 40ms (1/25th second) exposures. You could check visually by sweeping the pointer as quickly as you can across a wall. Your eye should just about be able to pick up the pulses then.
Can you do compare harmonic frequencies with dissonant ones? Also place the mirror on different positions and see the difference
This reminds me exactly of a great game called Auditorium on iOS and PC. Enjoy! And awesome video. Thanks!
Were you using just tuning or equal temperment? It sounded like ET to me. You might get different/better results with just.
you should play oscilloscope music on the speaker
That would make a very nice geeky screensaver or wallpaper or visualizer.
It's amazing how some of them resemble magnetic fields.
I like your red pipe.  Pretty rad.
There’s a 3DS synth app called DSN-12 that lets you view your sounds as these lissajous curves. I love that app!
He should play the beat for “look at me now” by Chris brown
I love and respect you for making this video. 😂
one question, could work in a plexiglass or cristal cube to see it in 3 dimension?
935 comments!  wow.   you probably won't see this one.  Curious if you had multiple mirror fragments.. different color lasers .. if the paths at different spots would be travelling differently, or in sync with each other, etc?  could look good.
Nothing could have prepared me for 2:52
much like  Lissajous patterns. I'm curious is the lissajous patterns match the laser patterns.
Fantastic. Thumbs up! \n\nGreetings everyone! I'm trying to start a music video channel here on YouTube but it's difficult to get seen. \n\nThe music is instrumental and may fall under categories ranging from mellow to rock to hip hop - but mostly a unique combination of them all. The videos are original and usually random - whatever comes to mind in the moment. \n\nI'm new to both video and music production so I will gladly acknowledge input from anybody willing to offer it. If you have the time, click my icon and let me know what you think. Thank you in advance, it's much appreciated!
If you adhere mylar to the bowl will the laser make a different pattern at different points on the surface?
Could the multiple start and stop point be because the laser is missing the mirror briefly?
Steve - great concept. I think a good follow-up video could discuss pure intervals ie frequencies related by whole number ratios (2/1, 3/1, 7/3, 11/7, etc). We can both hear and see the purity of these intervals. These intervals form the basis of all tonal music. Except that we now temper all music now so that we can use 12 pitch classes and navigate between them. It wasn't always like this. But I think this visualization is a good way to understand temperament. I actually think you could do a really great video on tuning and temperament, which could include info the overtone series and info about timbre.
How about using couple mirror fragments in different spots in the bowl and a couple different laser colors?
Instead of writing a script, why not use a DAW and compare basic wave cycles and complex ones?  A simple synthesizer will have sine, sawtooth, square, and pulse width modulation.  You can even get into FM synthesis, which at its basic is the modulation of one sine wave with another, itself, or a complex network of sine waves.
could you posibly use this proces in a reverse way and make sound with an image?
I'm high as shit watching this and its in-sane
You just found the language of aliens!
To me, it's like sensory porn. Can't stop watching this.
I have a suggestion for you. Put the mirror on the bridge or soundboard of a guitar or other instruments.  Would be cool to see.
Why not orient the laser so that simple notes are round or oval?
Really cool! Is this reproducible? Wouldn't the laser path be wildly different depending on the speaker used, type and elasticity of rubber, placement and weight of mirror, and angle of laser?\n\nI bet the laser was going off of the mirror in those examples that had multiple starts and stops.
Should play this Watch Oscilloscope Music on YouTube - Oscilloscope Music: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFgoUhNvMLrr8izq38HX6rjFR-nkfklxw
would be interesting to see how the placement of the mirror piece might affect it.
did you try beat frequencies?
6:28 idea is that laser dot is of the mirror and there is a fiew starting points
More starting and ending points can be caused by rolling shutter if you have camera with CMOS sensor. Ccd sensors doesnt have this effect.
Classical must be the most beautiful music with this technique 😊
Rolling shutter causes the multiple start/finish points, I think?
You should collaborate with slo mo guys for this project
Fuck it's like an actual object of green flexible beam frame!
maybe try two different colored lasers, and offset their angles just slightly for a neat stereoscopic type effect
Lower the frame per second, and then it would probably  look better
Can you give an estimation on how much it moves, and if you add another piece of balloon in a ring (as a mic) can you tell how much it moves ?
laser is amplified ordinary light.\nit is amplified by storing as much light energy as needed for particular laser power and then releasing it.\nIt is usually released by special mirror, which will pass only high power light, but will reflect low power light
Maybe the mirror moved to much so that the laser didn't hit it at all at some points. So it starts and ends multiple times per frame
multiple starting points: probably because of rolling shutter. check smartereveryday about this
“You’ll be pleased to know I used very few comments” wait what
I would love to see you do this while using Jerobeam Fenderson's Max/MSP patches for oscilloscope music.
Wow. Simple. Effective. Yet, I've never seen it before. Fantastic.
Rolling shutter? or maybe interlacing? Record with fancy highspeed camera nad simulate rolling shutter or interlacing to see what is really going on.
(1) For the multiple start and stop points, it reminds me of the double slit experiment, and its subsequent tests: https://youtu.be/8ORLN_KwAgs?t=2m12s.\n(2) It looks as though the patterns are making an attempt at a multidimensional shape, do you have any way to test that? Possibly a fog machine or something similar to a 'True 3D' Display: https://youtu.be/EndNwMBEiVU\n(3) If you were to feed the sounds developed by your square plates to the speaker, are there any similarities in patterns? Possibly projecting the laser on to the plate at the same time as strumming it.\n(4) Does the position/shape/size of the mirror alter the results? \n(5) If you had two or more projections casting simultaneously, do the patterns differ?
Id love see these patterns reproduced on a cloud of artificial fog, so we could see them in three dimensions!
Rolling shutter is the problem! Check out the video of smarter every day about this topic it's very well explained!
Wow.  This is astonishing.  Positively fantastic, man.  This is one of the coolest ways to visualize an aspect of sound that I've ever seen!
Nothing new about this.
Play jerobeam fenderson's song Shrooms on this. It draws pictures on an oscilloscope it would be cool to see what it does here.
Rolling Shutter Effect - same reason you get distorted images when filming propellers?
I'd love to see how the intervals between pitches differ the pattern and relationships between them. Like comparing 3rds and 5ths and various triads. That would be fantastic
Disliked bc you didn’t comment your code 😤😤😤
play some of those osciloscope music
So this is how they make those cool screen savers...
this is a home made XY occiloscope
Anyone know what kind of laser he used? If not, at least a similar one?
I spy, with my little eye, Lissajous patterns! :D
Good thinking putting the watermark over the “exciting bits” that people would try to freeboot.
Very cool.  I'm going to start playing with this immediately.\nThis reminds me a lot of an on the cheap laser effect my astronomy professor built in the college planetarium for some of our rock shows.  He had spinning double-mirror arrangement that would get bumped/vibrated by a small subwoofer next to it for a similar effect (though only to the bass).  It would spirograph to the beat and bass line, and then he would kick on a fan blade of sorts to break up the beam.  It would dart around like a firefly on crack.  Pretty damn cool for late-eighties homemade!
I wonder how it'll look in slow motion
I don't know why you'd need JavaScript to to precisely control the frequency of sine waves when there are very sophisticated programs available for precision control of sound. \nThey can even do fancy things like square waves, saw waves and realtime filtering!\nThe best thing is many are available for free and for your iOS device!\n\nAnyhow ... please download a synthesizer and do this again, I'd like to see how more complex wave shapes or filters would effect the laser.
I think the laser pulsate at a very high frequence. This is so cool !!
Play something on an electric piano hooked to the speaker
I would love to make a visualizer like this, and it should be fairly easy, but....  Is there a nice membrane that would get a similar visual effect but would not distort the sound too much?
Because of how the laser takes such a long path, is the point at which the laser is pointing and moving, faster than the speed of light which makes it path visible?
So can a video file be converted to its raw data, mostly binary, then played over the horizontal (ish) moving freq ....would that yield a 3d video (of sorts) like the later clips presented (where there was a clear top & bottom to the figure with diagonal lines between them)?? Thanks for the video...😃
The intro vibrated the toast I was eating... that felt weird.
*IT'S OSCILLATING IN THE 5TH DIMENSION*
What the frick. That is super crazy awesome! Have you looked at all at relative frequencies (like a fifth) and if they resemble each other even with different pitches? Does A+E look at all like F+C? Or the same interval an octave lower or higher? Absolutely fascinating! Makes me want to go experiment!!
Maybe that's how an alien might see sound
I think the loose ends are caused by the rolling shutter effect, look it up, it’s cool
I knew the government were controling our minds with laser beams. Chem trails my ass the government have hippie wizards with portable speakers causing natural disasters and 9/11.
4th dimensional stuff going on there
Goddamit, Mould.  I held off watching this vid over other recommendations ... coz how much more science can there be really?  There was a lot of info in this vid, and you presented it all beautifully as usual. I never have a need to rewind or rewatch your vids because I missed something. Thank you again :)
satisfying as fuck my dog
funny pattern
lovely
Mesmerizing!
You look like Eddies twin
Mechanical oscilloscope
Very inventive idea!  Nice work.
play oscilloscope based music
Woah...it's like 3D screensavers
Awesome!
These look like lissajous figures
laser went off mirror temporarily?

Dubstep.
rolling shutter, maybe?
Reminds me of Lissajous curves
That was cool
brilliant
Amazing

31:35 realest part of the interview
Hot97 you fucking idiots, why the fuck you have the intro so fucking loud and then the interview low as shit.... Change that shit.
My ONLY goal is to make Hit after Hit after Hit until they give me what I know I deserve. Please turn your Aux cords, speakers, or Headphones ALL THE WAY UP IF YOU CAN & Please Share THE HELL outta it to ANY & EVERYONE if YOU think Im good enough for the Radio hahahaha!!!! Thank you..... https://m.soundcloud.com/lilfranchize/all-switch
So the shootout Game has talked about is the same shootout 50 claimed never happened?
Just scrolled down and gave every comment a like because it’s all positive! There is nothing bad to say about Curtis he is the last of a dying breed !!
man Ebro shouldve let him talk about hip hop beef for longer, he started cracking that shit open and Ebro got mad.
he pointed at fifty arm and he got an acute pain there.. which is inside his arm  see thats what white people do to u
Ebro n roswnberg r neurotic n annoying af especially Ebro he a bih. & 50 still the man ...& jay is too
50 cent will always have beef with jay because irv gotti was a main produce of jays classic resonable jay and irv got relationship period
50 getting old, sounding real emotional talking about Hov. Come on bruh. The Gs is watching
Lol the fed building.  The police station.  I see all the subliminals  They calling him a snitch and he don't realize it
I love to listen to him talk.
he hit it SPOT ON about Prodigy and how people responded. All of a sudden he was everyones FAVORITE rapper. not to say that same person never dabbled in Ps music but... don't get caught posing.
50 was too good for Interscope. Dude put out 2 legendary albums GRODT and The Massacre they still owe 50 big time IMO
Great how Fif points out how all these radio guys like Ebro talk S*** about everyone but keep sucking Jay Z balls,Charlemagne does same too
Great interview. If you have some time, I have a Rap single that I think can put me into the Industry. If you guys have time, type in Enzo - Count in the search bar and let me know what you think! I appreciate and love all of you!Thumbs up for Hip Hop.
thats where its at gladiator \nor is this just bearly coming out\n  about the deal \n  i fucks wit  fifty\n ,my explicits were in that direction\n  at the begining to em \n nothing against him or the camp\n im just tryna learn it and put the game on clamp\ni just aint wit none of that bs\nmake $ live life make music
Ebro will beat 50 in a fight, 50 only makes records about being gangster but that's as far as his gangster image goes, that's why 50 is a fan of ctg because they both run when they're confronted on the streets
50 one of the only real Niggas left in hip hop
26:50 is where it gets Real
ok.. what's with the whole NY hiphop destruction ?? did they have a fight long ago ?? what are they talking about? someone ?
The Game Album, 1. I Am  2.Make a wish 3.take what you want. 4.Real Problems  5.Sleepless and alone 6. Crazy 7.Will he make it 8.Ha ha ha. 9. Hungry 10. Looks Like me Sounds Like me. 11. light another smoke. 12. Stay Stoned 13. Parrinoid And in pain
Watched every 50 cent interview this a brilliant business man much respect big homie
Keep 50 Alive. 50 was the last of hip hop, if you don’t get it. The fact that the industry started looking for OTHER rap after him. Then you see it
Why Ebro look like the defensive coordinator for the New England Patriots?
where is the middle of 50's mustache lmaooo
Peace in the name of Christ. Important: Can someone get the following short vid in front of Jay Z & his people.. https://youtu.be/pFb0Xu2xJYg
Just cuz you talk loud don't mean your right.. Ebro way off 50 putting out hits and at that time hip hop was real anybody can get it respect to that movement
Dayum Laura styles can't take her eyes off 50 she looking at him like a snack haha
Ebro is right! Shit got messy and labels started signing whatever, wherever!
Ebro fucked it up cuz he aint play Ny's artists, now they start playing them boom u got Dave east, A boogie, don q and Young Ma. literally our fore front along wit pro era and maybe asap mob. Goes to show that ebro on some slime nigga shit
Queens get the money!
50 smacked the hell out of rosenberg arm at 15:02 lmao
haven't fucked with his music in years but i still like the guy
almost none of this makes any sense at all
50 could have been a Jay Z
Hi bitch i see you reading these comments 😈
Their is so much politics in this rap shit
To say 50 cent killed NYC Hip-hop is the dumbest statement I've heard from Ebro. NY hip-hop lost its identity and was trying to sound like the South which was already pounding the radio airways. It didn't work. The South took the torch and ran with it. NY artist started riding the coattails of the South.
NY artists tried to blackball 50, and then tried to fuck with him when he got on.
50 put me up on so much game watching this salute
Roseberg says the you know how horrible Trump is? like nobody likes him. These people bullshit someone voted for Trump.
I use to hate him but he a ill nigga #salute
He always give good interviews
damn how old is he? does he even age?
50 I'm next good one
thanks 50 for REALLY PULLING Ebro coat! YOU ARE THE BEST!
HANDS DOWN One of the best people in the world.. This negro I dont kno how to not respond to someone trying to hurt me ....So ima start hurting people. Lmao thinking like my uncle ass nigha
what does 50 mean when he says hiphop is a youth culture?
tom ford is my subscribtion
Like a flashback to 03/04 😂
So many underestimate 50s intelligence, he's so aware of everything around him. Just listen to the way he break everything down. Respect bruh
New York as a whole fucking let everybody takeover not fifty
50 is the REALIST nigga in the industry
50 is one of the smartest dude I'm still surprised he isn't head of a label or some kind of boss.   But he do whatever he want
He had to get them then he gave us a classic on The Massacre: PIGGY BANK
When is someone gonna slap this shit out of ebro!
50 one of the GOATs
Prodigy and Tupac were very similar. They really art students that took on the theme thugging
Ebro and his wack programming and dickriding killed NY exposure but not hip hop. You cant kill a culture.
50 Cent does not shut the fuck up...jesus.
Only here for 50. Fuck Ebro n Peter. Lame ass cornballs
Go 50 the realest man I know
My Nigga said the problem was I liked the record, but now I gotta fuck them up lmfaooo. He keep it real all the time. Respect to to 50
It's crazy when 50 Cent talks it's like he's talking to you secretly but not secretly... truthfully😎💯
E bro a hoe but he was professional about his shit big s.o to 50 that nigga is a pure business man
Fif n ebro fucked after this.
Buy Pain killers ,weight loss pills,anxiety/depression meds call or text (602) 730-2457
Lmao he is dumb. How do you not get the future line. He's saying he could've  ended up like that very easily and glad it didn't. That Ciara shit is a trash situation for a dude.
50 has always been an entrepreneur. Businessman to the tee
50 the best at interviews.. I learn so much.. 💪😎👍💯💯💯
Action Bronson. East coast rap Jesus Christ
Great interview. Thx.
50 is the goat
He right about Angie Martinez. That bitch been on Jayzs dick!! I think Jay Z fucked her a few times.
50 Kool
50 is a smart brotha
rosenberg dont ever wear that chain again my nigga looking like a fob pablo miguel diaz
IGNORANCE
@ 41:35 why Fifty clap like a seal lmao. Like a slow child
Only for 50!
50!
HOT 97 is trash
whatever get a life posa
Ebro...shut the hell up!
50 cent getting that paper
omaewa no shindeiru
at least ebro gave it back charlamagne licks fiddys ass and stays quiet
Ebro is such a fraud that all you can do is laugh at that nigga
50 cent real youth.big up
Top guy 50🙌🏽✊🏾🤓💰😎🥁
Salute Curtis Jackson aka 50cent
Genius ass businessman right here.

This was great Gus! you even did the closed captions!
I was very reminded of John Cleese in some MP.

I wish my gf is like this
I mean, what else is there to do at Stout?
Good work on the video, friend. I wish the description box had an elaborate description of what's going on in the video so I wouldn't be confused as to what's happening in this episode of primitive technology. Love your blog!

Hey
lmao this was great, Corbyn for PM
I don't like her or her party much but the media attacking her for having a cough is pretty low. She is a human being despite reports showing otherwise :s ...
Most offensive part of her speech...was claiming the Conservatives..were behind the eventual  justice for the Hillsborough 96...
I'm not Theresa May's biggest fan, but I thought she did really well.  First of all, she couldn't help having a bad throat.  Secondly, she should sack security for allowing the prankster to get even close to the podium.  Thirdly, she should sack the company who put the backdrop together, since a letter fell of it.  I thought she emerged from all of this was  her courage, resilience and bravery.
Shut up talking about other people May. YOU'RE PM!!!!! Such a WEAK political figure, do what you should do, get us a good brexit deal
hard working people with mortgages and finance are slaves to the person they are in debt to it tells you that in proverbs. your a slave to the bank how depressing.
Stop banging on about Jeremy bloody Corbyn, talk about brexit, talk about the future of the young, talk about housing.... Jeremy Corby is not the top agenda here, get your priorities in order or take the P45 and F off......
It's him from college humour
waiting game for the Simon Brodkins vid now
I would like to know how this guy was able to get this close to the PM.
Look at all the little kids in the comment section with no life experience
How to get loads of assholes in one room. Well done lee Nelson 👍👍😄😄
everything i’ve seen from this tory conference has been the most awkward thing ever
That man is so rude. TM should be treated with respect. Unlike a lot of politicians, TM always acts respectfully. What is GB coming to!!
Theresa: I know someone I'd like to give a P45 to it's Jeremy Corbyn \n\nCrowd: AAAAAYYYYYYH\n\nMe: Shut up you bunch of tossers
Sorry dear Teresa... Your fired before you can give P45 to Jeremy
I feel sorry for her but because of her I now need to push a shopping trolley around because I lost my mobility component
Should say Building a Country that works for me because that's all she cares about.
Horrible woman and crowd full of  sycophants. She is so weak and probably on antidepressant overload from all the backstabbing. She can't lay down on an evening from the wounds
Is it really that easy to get so close to the prime minister?
Boris as Prime Minister would wipe the floor with that scruffy socialist who goes by the name of Corbyn...
Theresa May AKA 'the body snatcher' interrupted by bloke with 'do not donate form'. . .
You can't win Theresa, for when you strike him down, he becomes more powerful than you could possibly know.
was she poisoned by touching the form?
I'd rather boil my head than vote Conservative.
Theresa May is hot 💖♨🔥
The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, friends. \n\nThere is so much pain in this world, and things are going to get a lot worse. \n\nJesus died so that we may live. \n\nIn this world, even as a Christian, we are going to suffer pain and tribulation, BUT Jesus promised us that we will dwell with Him someday in a new place, a new heaven and a new earth. There will be no more pain or suffering. In fact, God Himself will wipe all tears from our eyes. \n\nSo please, if you don't know Jesus, call upon Him today. Repent of your sins and put your faith in Jesus Christ. He loves you, my friends. He is not angry at you, although the devil will have you to believe that He is. This is not true, because Jesus is waiting on you to call upon Him in Truth. \n\nHe is not a God who forces Himself on you, He is a God that respects your decision, but He has shown us that each decision we make has consequences. \n\nSo make the greatest decision of your life and make Jesus your Lord and Savior. You will be forgiven, you will be delivered, you will be set free. \n\nTrust in His Love. \n\nI pray you consider calling out to Jesus, because to die without The Lord is a very dangerous thing - there is a major consequence to it. \n\nShalom, friends.
I don't understand why people can't see that you don't have to be a Labour supporter to criticise Theresa May, and that everyone should critically analyse the government, regardless of political affiliation. It's got nothing to do with patriotism, everyone on all sides spouting partisanship are a detriment to the country.
She is the greatist priminister in the histury of london
im sure she would like to give a p45 to jeremy corbyn, the glorious thorn in her side
Lee Nelson is a legend
LEE NELSON AT HIS BEST. WHAT A LEGEND!!!!!!
Funny. Jezza doesn't premeditate diss soundbites against Theresa May with pre-rehersed audience claps; watch how she gives her producer the evil eye. Could this woman get any more phony? She is a laughing stock. Just like the UK itself.
We don't talk about Corbyn\n*Repeats same line with him twice then mentions his name a third time after the prankster leaves*
how does someone get that close to the PM?...wow that's scary!
God why are both May and Corbyn both so hopeless and incompetent? I can't bring myself to ever support any of those clown shows. \n\nAt the current rate, I'm going to end up having to support the Lib Dems.
And, she takes the P45.  Yes!!!!  Bye!
tories still keeping corbyn in the news👏
P45 is something to do with becoming unemployed
Go on Lee Nelson!!!!!
Hey it’s Grant from college humour!
It's the jeopardy font
only matter of time Jeremy Corbyn will take your job!!  so just resign may!
That's Simon Broadkin AKA BBC's Lee Nelson a doctor by qualifications.
don't understand. what a waste of 1 minute of my life
I'm a fan of Jeremy corbyn myself but when I watched this I thought the only way it could of gone worse is if borris punched the guy;)
She got a complex about Corbyn the same was Trump has a Clinton complex..\nYuck
The security is awful! Could you imagine if that was a terrorist?
Politics are stupid. That's why I enjoy this beautiful video
ENGLAND IS HER CITY
*It's about time the people gave the government and the royal family its P45*
Love to see all the youth and freshness at these conferences.
She should keep it.\n\nCould come in handy for her.
Mossad all over this one.
Why do the left wing make themselves look more stupid than the far right they’re such a massive laughing stock
If only the Las Vegas shooter was here instead.

That voice crack....
England ISH MA SCHITY
Sigh, Brits... your country's a _mess._
I like how May rarely shows angry emotions when pressurised.
I don't follow politics so can someone give me a sum up of what happened and why is it so relevant/number 1 on YouTube?
So that's what Lee Nelson is up to these days such a joker 😂
What's a P45? a secret document or something?
What a cheap last comment she makes lol. Stfu May XD
That's no man, That's the legend that is Simon Brodkin. Search him up, you'll thank me later.
Leave him alone you tory assholes😂

Hahaha epic!
some crooked leftist thinks he is funny
*spends 5 minutes in the comments section looking for what a p45 is* \nO well back to my own politics. Shall not be INFRINGED! You won't take our guns.
Who voted for this liberal bore?

That guy is jerry from rick and mor
whiteness is now a crime to liberals like adumb
How did Idubbbz's latest video get 5 million views in a day and not get on trending but this politicized agenda-filled anti-white kike trash gets less than a million and is number 2?
Are you fucking kidding me? The video even says the practice ended in 1963. Besides, back then the country was 90% White. You're basically saying that White people should not benefit from the instiutions they create.
I wonder where Adam lives?
For some reason I read suburbs as sideburns... I was not expecting this video :/
Seems the racists in the comments can’t handle cited facts or distinguish an introductory joke from the content.
Don't you just love how people bring up stuff like this and then look at you like you can do something about it? I'm perfectly aware of what racism and discrimination has done to minorities, but stop pretending that I can do something to fix it! I may be white, but I'm not a miracle worker. And just so you know, I didn't live in a rich suburb, my parents didn't pay for my college education, I had to work hard to get my degree, and even after all that, I'm currently renting a room and working a minimum wage job, while trying to pay my loan payments every month. I'm not seeing the white privilege you all are speaking of.
So what are we supposed to do about it then? Having the information is awesome but we have no clue on how to reverse this process to stop it continuing
What do you expect him to do? Sell his house so it's fair? He can't make a difference and that's the truth.
i am so glad im not american lmao
The suburbs are full of successful non-white immigrants. indians, asians, africans ect. When will you stop blaming your skin color for your shortcomings. Identity politics being shoved down our throat. And youtube puts things in trending that arnt actually trending, its what they want to be trending!
white americans are the worst in human race. other people are out spokenly racist, while you in the comment section ignore FACTS presented to you, just so you don't have to admit to yourself all the priviliges you are given and without them you and your families would be in the same situation as black familis.
my parents live in Levittown...they eat chicken and drink cheap pink champagne on their yacht.
can you give us some LINKS to all these sources because the few that i did track down were disprovable with 3 seconds of googling.
Am I the only one who's really scared of how do most of the comment react to this video? Why does everybody has to be so racist nowadays that they either think segregation was right, either refuse to believe actual historical facts are real about race matters? Just to let you know, being pro segregation and being against of accepting to believe segregation has ever happened so you won't have to act as if any group has any more problem than yours is not any better than being an SJW student that regulary accuses her proffessors of rape and that loves communism.
Waiting for Adam Ruins ANTIFA and Black lives matter.
lol look at all of these racist idiots feeling butthurt
60 years ago evil white racists put black people in Ghettos. They just drew a line across the city; One side was for pure white Aryans only while the other was for filthy nonwhites. They let the other side of the city go to shit while shooting any black person trying to get to their side. This is why we have to exterminate the white race today.  -Accurate Depicition of history according to this video
Wait, what? No solutions? No ideas of how to make it better? Just here's a reason to feel guilty, goodbye!? Come on, Adam, this isn't what your show is about right? At least tell us there are no clear solutions so we know you thought about it...
Why is Chinatown so Chinese? RACIST!!?!!
And this country teaches the whole world how to live?
Let me put it this way. Let's say you have a white male in his mid 20's that wears flannels and has a combover haircut, and a black male of the same age wearing a black tee, some fresh jeans, a lined up beard and a fade going on. Both living in a more ghetto area. A gang (of African American origin) rolls by in their gangster car whatever that may be. They're looking to recruit. They see the white man, and the black man standing side by side. Who is more likely for the black gang to want to join them? The black man. So the black man says yes and runs off toting guns (doing normal gang stuff) and he gets into a skrimish with the police because of this activity. He's going to panic while doing whatever he's doing and may run from or pull a gun on the police. He takes his gun out and pow goes the officers weapon. Killing the black man for putting the officers life in danger, justifiably no? So then it gets to the media. Hate crime white officer kills innocent black man so we pin the blame on Mr. WhiteOfficer and those in the neighborhood he was from riot against the police, because clearly the black man was innocent, how couldn't he be? He's black, black people are innocent of everything! (Sarcasm obviously) but let's go back to the why's and how's. Why did the black man join the black gang? Because he was black and felt he fit in. He could have said no but he didn't. He could have followed the same path as the mid 20's white man. Got a job, saved money, and moved out of this neighborhood. But instead he dies and it's white people's fault, and nobody else. It's not any governments fault for the black man joining this drug running gun slinging gang. It's his own. I'm not sure if you or anybody else notices but, black people, white people, Spanish people, Muslim people, Chinese, the list goes on. We ALL have a brain. We ALL have goals. Why is it every other race can manage to pull themselves out of shitty ghetto neighborhoods, but black people can't? Tell me, when's the last time you saw a Korean in the hood? Maybe China Town in NY, but I doubt outside of that. I'm convinced, black people are used to that life, they don't want to better themselves, they don't want to better their communities. Call me racist or whatever you'd like, but think about that. It's not about the color of your skin, it's about the strength of your body and soul.
So the fact that in a America the vast majority of the population is white and only around 20 percent are of different ethnicities means that there should be only white suburbs just simply because of the numerical difference. is it wrong that people want to live with their Own kind when we see so many cities and towns go to shit after large numbers of blacks moved there and instead of getting jobs the went into crime and how dare you say unbearably white there would be upheaval if you said the same about blacks
Social justice Propaganda, why am i not surprised.
Let me guess 80% of all comments will misrepresent everything Adam said, and not even read any of the sources listed!
So this is how its going to end.
I didn't choose which of the three sided dice my soul would occupy, so I'll no more accept your vicarious responsibility, than allow you or any other racially indoctrinated soul to paint my identity.
Nothing wrong with being white you fuckin racists
So what the white guy should just sell his home that he worked hard for because he is using a racist system and to avoid being a racist?\nWell that seems completely unfair.
Too bad President *L* oving *B J* is gone because, though IDK? I suspect that he'd be good for a blow.
Am I the only one that hears sims 3 music
Why home ownership is actually a terrible investment Wasn't this one of the episodes ?? \nAdam ruins continuity. 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️😞
If you're Black and this video made you sit back down and whine instead of working harder, you are part of the problem not a victim.
Complete opposite in Metro Vancouver. City proper, incredibly expensive to purchase a home, let alone rent. Move out to Surrey, Delta and Langley to find affordable housing.
I've never cared less about a series than the series Adam Ruins Everything.
Reminds me of Samantha Bee and her husband not wanting to integrate their kids school.
So who's the next CF regular to get a spin-off ..  preferably one that's actually funny. Trapp is maybe  the best bet,but he's probably enjoying his position as the top dog rn
what a fuckn joke - go to any country and its a different color - the medias attack on white ppl is disgusting - this guy deserves a beat down
I would totally buy that board game. And that twin towers Jenga.
This makes it sound like being in a white neighborhood is inherently bad... Racism.
waht...the practices seems designed to favor colo9red folks...so why are they disadvantaged?
if you went to a school that was very diverse you will know that people just like hanging out with people of the same race. the mexican kids all hung out with mexicans cuz they all speak spanish. the blacks hangout with blacks because they all like the same music. the whites hung out with whites cuz they were in band together haha. it's not always like that cuz no one at my school was racist but a lot of the time that's how it worked out. maybe the reason that the racist laws have been romoved for 60 years and a lot of the neighborhoods are still black/white is because the blacks and the whites just like it that way in a totally non racist way? in america no matter what race you are if you graduate high school work full time and you wait until 21 to be married and wait until marriage to have a baby you only have a 2% of being poor. lets get black people to graduate and to stop having all their babies out of wedlock and then a generation from now lets see if your narrative of white people oppressing the blacks still makes any sense!
Hmm...  demonizing a community because of something that happened 70 years ago and adding the term racist housing to make people look bad just because they have a home in the suburbs I'm not racist...  but without knowing it ... also, this reminds me of something I heard:\nBurning down shit ain't going to help nothing! ... Y’all burning down shit we need in our community. Take that shit to the suburbs. Burn that shit down! We need our shit! We need our weaves. I don’t wear it. But we need it.
Adams hair is slowly getting higher every video
SOMEONE FUCKIN TELL ME WHAT GOOGLE SAID I DON’T HAVE TWO HOURS TO WATCH IT
#2 Trending on YouTube is accurate. This video is shit. YouTube is shit. And YouTube's Trending algorithm is shit.
The whole Democratic party is a sham. They pretend that they are for African Americans but they know as soon as they really help them they will vote Republican. If you want to see the effects of Democratic leadership look at the top 10 poorest cities and then who runs them.
There's a difference between explaining why suburban neighborhoods are mostly white and saying that whites should move out of the neighborhoods. Pretty sure most people complaining about how Adam wants genocide for white people are missing the point of the video. I'm white by the way, not that it should matter, but if you really can see only whites as valuable to society then it's pretty important, sad as it is, that I state that before you even consider my opinion
Why is this a college humor segment? It's not funny. It's designed to inspire guilt in white people. Leave the guilt tripping shit to other channels
You n*ggers stay off my suburbs!
Hmm. It's almost like white people don't like being told that they're getting underhanded privilege. Almost like this comment section is full of people who would rather miss the point to deflect guilt that accept that their country is founded on systematic racism so as to make it better. Almost like, I don't know, the commenters are biased themselves as they claim the video to be. Who would have thunk it?
Yeah, let's blame white people -_-
Like as if white people in America are really stupid and have no idea about their history and their neighborhoods. FOH
Omg enough you liberal white cuck move on what does anyone get from keep talking about the bullshit past... im white my family left me nothing no one gad money.. no one got inheritance.. not all whites are rich
I guess the government made fathers leave their families too. \n72% of African American kids are raised in a single parent household. \nBlacks committed a third of crime while only being 13% of the population. \nThis has led to a quarter of African Americans not graduating high school \nAlso while leading the way in unemployment. \n\nAmerica is the land of the free. Racism is NOT a major barrier anymore. If you want success go get it. Stop blaming people.
Not funny, may as well renamed yourself to SJW Humor. This was just preachy and biased, also racist against whites. Oh and Detroit is TOO black, say that next time I dare you cowards
The outrage is due to the fact that laws were blatantly created to support white people and discriminate against minorities, which is the point of the video.This is not a problem of the average white citizen wanting to raise a family in the suburbs, it's the fact that the government supported such a shitty law and that the effects of it are still seen today. It's not about white communities not being diverse, it's about minorities not getting the same opportunity to join those communities. I think some of you just saw a video having to do with the topic of race that put white people in a bad light and wrote your angry comments not even listening to the actual problem.
We need a black president to fix racism!
Geez, gotta love the people thinking that pointing out racism is racist.
I'm not white but goddamit will college humour stop piling on the white guilt??!!?? Yeah we get it,  it's 2017 and it's cool to hate on white people. Am I the only person of colour who sees how hypocritical it is to judge TODAY'S generation of whites for the sins of their predecessors?
I hope the episode actually has some proposals on how to fix this.
Judging by the comments it sounds really hard to be white in America. I mean y'all seem so discriminated and hated on in your own country. I guess I'll stay here in Europe.
Lol this video is cancer.
Well at least the government knew what was right back then. We created Liberia to send them back and they stayed. Diversity causes problems. Segregation creates unity amongst races.
Land of the free
wow, black people sure have it rough.\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n*shrug*\n\nsucks to be you guys, lol.\n\nplease excuse me while i go smoke my cigar and go golfing. you can carry my clubs if you want, boy.
Adam should ruin the wage gap, if he has the balls.
That's what da hood means
I hate suburbs they're for middle class, I prefer apartment studios in downtown.
why can't the old cast return? why are we watching BuzzFeed rejects?
Damn all the racists came out on this one 😒
College Humor
You guys are just now noticing how much propaganda is in this show? It has been that way since the start but they disguise most of it and build trust in other areas so people fall for it. The simple fact of the matter is that black people can work hard and make enough money to live in a nice suburb. If you are a black mom or dad, please teach your kids the truth, that they can do anything they want in life as long as they work hard and stick to it. Do not teach your kids this propaganda which will only discourage them from pursuing their dreams. There is a reason why people keep leaving channels like this and subscribing to channels like mine instead. People are tired of propaganda. That is why we have over 75,000 subscribers in under 6 months.
Can I get 1 subscriber pls😰😰

Reported for racism against white people and hate speech. Reported once again from another account for leftist marxist propaganda. \n\n\n*white pride!*
it's just all so tiresome.
So funny how the suburbs in America are the 'nice' areas while they're absolute shitholes everywhere else in the world. Why would you want to live FAR AWAY from the city center, where the best shopping, dining, culture, and jobs are? Idiots.
”since property values in the WHITE neighborhoods are so much higher their schools get way more money to spend on things such as .... Translation: Those areas pay a lot more in property tax they can't opt out of but they should feel guilty and privileged because reasons.
In 1940 92% of people where white
But now you can work hard and move into the the nice community's, nice schools and have nice things.
lmao at all the defensive people here getting outraged at the idea that they benefit from racism
Just because the schools are highly populated in white, black, or Asian, doesn't mean it's segregated, segregated means a certain race or color can't do things or be around another other race that do those things too, schools can't not accept students because of their color...wtf...they're so wrong it's disturbing...
There are a couple of ways to get out of a poor neighborhood: Sports, Music, Military, or College studying something useful. I don't understand why people don't recognize that institutional inequality can be overcome at the individual level with a little hard work and strategy. Poor kids get scholarships and minority kids get scholarships. Most qualify for military service if they can't find a good job. Some can be entertainers.
You should do more videos like this! I love these impromptu casual videos :D
Mukbang is a 2 korean word combination which basically means eating broadcast! Muk/Meok = eat & bang from the word bangsong = broadcast 🍴📹

I love how you guys are lw matching (:
I crawled up and near died at your pet peeve.... I am guilty of it  but I have an excuse, I swear!!! I wear glasses and whenever I do mascara (I love it by the way) it always ends up leaving  black lines as it crushes into my lenses. I have tried everything, even extensions, but it literally made me claustrophobic as it put pressure onto my eyelids smashed into my lenses. I did dye my lashes and while it did look slightly better, it lacked the stockiness that mascara gives, and the fumes were SO unpleasant. So...... After all my attempts I suppose I am relegated to being the pet peeve of my favorite YouTubers.... Such is my life.....
I know where alfies testicles have been 😂😂
Zoe‘s jumper matches Louise‘s hair and they both have a yellow coat or cardigan :)

How did Arnold alive back?\nPlease make this
Could Arnold survive to an atomic bomb? :D
The way he got ready to fight against that outlet though 😂
*Wtf?I can make a very cool advertising for you, just give me $1,000,000 WTF? HE SAID THIS ON DESCRIPTION WTF?*
You can survive a lighting strike\n\nYesterday I died in a car crash because the lighting striked me but I was still alive

Cole MacGrath done it\n\n\n\n\n\nBut their is a guy who got sruck 7 times and is living
how about making a cartoon show?
Send Arnold to a cloud and see what happend?
what will happen when you keep on eating
Meet Arnold, how could you have 700000 subscribers in just 10 videos?
the title: Can a Lightning Burn You Alive? CAN A LIGHTNING!?!?!?

I'm so glad you're always on trending on every video.
what if Arnold got his ass eaten by a horde of Minions? Thumbs up so we can see this!!!
WHY DOES ARNOLD ALWAYS LOSE A FINGER
Who else was here from the beginning
pleass buuld arnold go inside to the lava
Are you from the channel 'Riddle' ?
did anyone notice that Arnold loses a finger every episode?
If arnold go to the sea
Who was here before this channel blew up
what if Arnold was put in the refrigerator for a week
What about the temperature?
This is the best channel on YouTube right now.
You're almost near to 1M subscribers!
What if Arnold took a bath filled with leechers
million view in 12 hour, only Arnold can do it.
What if Arnold was at ground zero and got hit with a 500 megaton nuclear bomb?\nIf he was 25 miles away from the blast?\nInside a pressure cooker?\nCrucified (on a cross)?\nBody slammed by a Kung Fu expert on concrete?\nWhat would happen if he flew out of the Milky Way Galaxy and tried to get back in and find his way back to our solar system?\nIf he went to Pluto?\nWhat if he exhaled literally ALL the air out of his Lungs?\nWhat if he breathed pure Carbon Monoxide or Carbon Dioxide for 5 minutes?\nBurn him with a flame thrower.  \nWhat if he were abducted by a UFO and returned to Earth safely 24 hrs later and the US government quarantined him afterwards and tried to brainwash him and convince him that UFOs don't exist and if you tell anybody about the UFO abduction, we'll kill you and your family, etc.?\nWhat if he was in a vacuum chamber? \nWhat if he got shot in the leg with a 50 caliber bullet? Or a 12 gauge OO buckshot?\nIf he flew a hot air balloon or an airplane too high up into the atmosphere, just to the edge of space, where planes can not fly any higher?\n(Of all of these, the one I'm most interested in is: What if he flew outside of the Milky Way Galaxy and tried to get back to our solar system. \nJust a hint to get started: The escape velocity of the Milky Way is approximately 1.2 Million Miles per hour!\nThe Galaxy is about 100,000 ly across by approximately 300 ly thick. It is traveling towards the Andromeda Galaxy at a rate of somewhere between 70 and 75 miles per second!\nBut what would happen to him outside of the protection of the galaxy? Would there be a different amount of radiation etc outside the galaxy? Could he ever get back in the Milky Way? Since the galaxy is traveling so fast, would that be similar to jumping out of a racecar that is traveling at 350 MPH? This scenario brings up way too many questions! But, that's what would make it so interesting.)
*S U B S C R I B E  T O  H I S  I N S T A G R A M*
My dad was struck by lightning as a kid and he's just fine. Creepily friendly with strangers, but I think that's just what middle age does.

What will happen if you went down to the bottom of the ocean without a scuba suit

Let me guess he loses his finger?
You can die. \nForgot to mention that?
Send Arnold to other planets without a spacesuit to see how long you wpuld last, some planets like mercury you actually last a little less than 2 minutes
A L I G H T N I N G

Best videos ever made is in this channel
There should be a movie of all these videos combined once you made enough videos
I'm guessing that a non native English speaker writes the scripts for these videos, I understand what it's trying to say but the wording is sometimes a little clunky.
Wow this Channel is growing fast. Been here since before 50k ;)

SUB TO HIS INSTAGRAM????
Am I late watching?
A person can be paralyzed for life, although it might be only temporary\n\nWhat?
The series is a pun itself reflecting on how we're already there, hence the black mirror revealing it.
I guess this is the best analysis as to why we get hooked to Black Mirror in a way that is not even close to  the others. After every episode, we can't really figure out what emotion we feel and that is what makes it memorable.
You a should have include spoiler alerts
it's because it's redpilled(cringey term sorry) about human nature and pessimistic yet ironic and therefore humorous. the show could have been a lot bleaker by offering no respite through irony
i see typos a lot in your videos. Is it because your channel is a one-man thing or it's an inside joke I missed because I wasnt here long before?
From watching this video I have no idea why somebody would watch this shit
One thing that also makes it so disturbing, at least to me, is that the scenarios that happen are so plausible. It's the tech and trends we have today taken only a few steps further, in a bad direction. So it feels very eerie because it might actually happen.
I think this is the first time that I do not agree with most of the arguments of a video in this channel. In addition to the extensive presentation of the concept of catharsis in Aristotle that in the end does not fit with what Blackmirror is, I think the analysis does not hit the point.\n\nBlackmirror is a tragedy at the precise point where it is a cultural event in which people, via a mythic / fictional narrative, are presented to the pure dilemmas of ordinary life.\n\nHere where Aristotle missed, the video also misses. The tragedy does not aim at any moral or intellectual catharsis. Tragedy is a cultural event that when give to see  a fiction, gives to see culture itself, ie a black mirror.\n\nNow, about the reason people see the show is precisely because it's a more real reality show. Television with the concept of reality show can only come to a nutty satire of reality, it is in the mythology of a tragedy that we come to the real. In other words, it is by the fiction itself that we have reached the maximum of reality - Blackmirror is that. (sorry 4 bad english)
When the hell is season 4 coming out I can't wait much longer!!!
I don't like Black Mirror so I don't watch it.\nIt's interesting, smartly done, and I agree with your description of why it's unique. However, I don't enjoy novelty for its own sake. I personally don't find anything enjoyable in watching Black Mirror. It's novel for a fictional show, sure, but tragedies in real life are often the exact same way (tragedy without reason, catharsis, or closure), so I don't get anything more out of the show than I get from empathizing with real stories of tragedy we hear about every day.
I need to finish the most recent season still. I was two episodes away and loving it and now this has basically incentivized me to do so.
Good thing I watched got and breaking bad before I watched this 😂
YOU FUCKING IDIOT I SPOILED SO MANY THINGS... HOW CAN YOU BE SO RETARDED?
Stop whining about GoT spoilers. If you haven't seen it yet get off the internet
Finally a great cultural critic touching on a great cultural relic
Um real-life tragedies do quite well, I assure you.
You're not supposed to wear hats inside.
can you do one on bojack horseman? please
Oh I didn’t know Walter white dies...
What’s the outro music
Ive been waiting for this episode ever since i watched black mirror. Thanks.
For me, I actually can't stand this show because of these very reasons. I'm huge Twilight Zone fan, and everything in this show comes off as lazy writing in comparison. We need a moral; we need a point. I don't see how anyone can call it genius- it's lazy, and unremarkable. My two cents.
I don't watch Black Mirror anymore because it is so depressing and dark.  I don't need that in my life.  I watched the first three seasons, waiting for an episode where there's a happy ending (or at least one that wasn't really tragic) but it never came so, I'm done.  Good riddance.
Can't tell if spoiler comments are jokes or not...
No wtf I watch Black Mirror for it's look into another universe similar to ours where we can see what might happen if technology goes that way.      Never do I watch to pity ppl or for the fear or tragedies, smart writers.   It's basically technology twilight zone but more realistic.
It is sad that you have to endorse these products. I'm sure you hate doing it. Hopefully you'll earn enough money on Patreon & stuff so you can drop their endorsed as***.
Good essay. Like it. Nice add too.
Why do you need to show game of thrones footage so long for an analysis video of black mirror? I didn't get any deep dived depth of reasoned analysis what you generally do in other video. I watch black mirror became of the powerful imagination the show can evoke be it in a form of tragedy or something else. It points out to the society that yes we are gonna get those high tech stuff but society are you gonna retain your morality ? Are you still be a society or everything reflected upon you will be totally dark ie black ?
faking Interestingly, I watched some of Black Mirror and found the insight into technology gone wrong interesting, but ultimately, after a few episodes, felt simply disgusted and unfulfilled.
People keep watching because unconsciously they believe there IS a meaning and moral. They're sure (unconsciously) that after enduring all the tragedy and sadness, they'll eventually understand something pertinent. The promise of closure and insight is built into the way humans approach stories, we expect it. And the more we endure, the more important we expect the payoff to be. Black Mirror is essentially tragedy-porn.\n\nKind of the same reason people kept putting up with LOST's bullshit. And why people felt betrayed when the payoff was dumb/not worth it. Maybe if people get used the betrayal of a pointless exercise in bad feelings, they'll just consume without expecting a payoff? They'll just concern themselves with how pretty it is. Maybe the interesting, shocking visuals are the payoff.
Fuck dude. Why do you keep blowing my mind?
The only problem with Black Mirror is the first episode, its not a bad episode by any means but turns people off to the show because it is far more outlandish that many of the other better written episodes. I always tell people to skip the first episode and come back to it later when they understand the show better. Episode 2 should have been the first episode.
Why do you keep giving stuff away? Jesus it is like i have to have watched game of thrones and breaking bad to even watch your stuff! WTF???
At 0:55 episode description is wrong. Its Season 1 Episode 2
it's not that complicated....BM is  just the twilight zone' IN THE 21ST century, morals are so 20th century, now it is just existential debt
Personally I watch shows to get AWAY from reality, not to get closer to the horrible reality that is life, thats why I believe this show sucks.
Watch the documentary Hypernormalisation. By the end you will conclude that Black Mirror is real life and you will understand how we got to this point.

It's a really good show. But something i don't understand is why people quit watching after the first episodes. I suggested this show to alot of friends. More than half quit wich i don't understand because is so good
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR SO LONG! THANK YOU!
Better question would be... What the fuck is black mirror?
I am a simple man.  I see Black Mirror, I click like.
Please keep doing this show
Have fun yelling around the corner in that U-SHAPED KITCHEN!!!
We watch it because it's so fucking well made. One of the few shows that ever were
I hate how dark Black Mirror is, but can't stop watching it...
After three episodes, I quit watching Black Mirror. It just gave me the continuous creeps for days afterward and resembles life here in silicon valley a little too closely for comfort.
Does Blue Apron have a vegetarian option? Or will meat come as part of the order?
Stopped watching black mirror as I stopped to see any point in the show. First I thought it was commentary on technology or the human condtion/frailty, but as you said, it really isn't. It's just a punch in the stomach every time. I don't particularly like being punched, especially when I can't hit back. So if a show has no redeeming qualities for hurt it inflicts on me as the viewer, it's not worth watching imo. Also stopped watching the walking dead for the same reason (and for its repetitiveness).
Notice how he didn’t include any clips from The Waldo Moment, as if it didn’t exist? Good job Nerdwriter, Waldo really doesn’t belong with the rest.
What makes black mirror so dark?\n\nWell its a black mirror daaa
yea ultimately I like it, but I feel like it reflects the same sort of shortcutting that's already missing in lots of modern media... its a type of thing that can stand on its own but could easily become oversaturated like chuck pahlaniuk's writing style or another series is hellgirl... it seems a lot more what the people want than really what they need
In the very least, PLEASE put a SPOILER warning in the video and in the video title in future.
Dear Nerdwriter, please put in the description of your videos WHICH shows will be spoiled.  I watched this video knowing full well i had seen all of black mirror, but only the first season of breaking bad.  And, (not to spoil it for anyone else reading this) i was pretty annoyed with one of the shots here.\nThanks
You got one of the scene sources wrong\n\n0:56 is the right episode, Fifteen Million Merits, but it's Season 1 Episode 2. Not Season 3 Episode 6.
Why is he talking about that song from Arcade Fire?!
It's a modern twilight zone
Well I know what I'll be re-binge watching tonight
I get that Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones are very popular shows, but a spoiler warning would be nice.
The end of this felt very Cowboy Bebop-ish. In fact it was nearly spot on
Dude,Officially edit this video with a warming that you are going to give away Spoilers of Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones.If these were some shitty shows then no one would mind but these are the best ones so do it and be responsible .
Black Mirror is kind of interesting to me, but after about 5 episodes I kind of got bored. A friend recommended the show to me and said it was really dark and messed up, but it's really not that dark. It's just a show about the dangers of technology, and some slightly different ways we aren't using it yet.
huh. that would explain why it's so bad
Great 2:00  in and a huge GoT spoiler. If only there were some way to alert people that you're going to give away major plot points to totally unrelated tv shows. Have a dislike.
My days are better when you post a video. Thank you for sharing your talent.
Cool video. Also that blue apron thing is a cool idea never seen it before. Very intriguing
San junipero doesn't really fit into this formula and t won an Emmy so...
I am so obsessed with Black Mirror but I always preface my recommendations with it's really dark but really good. I feel like I have to. It's so freaking amazing and makes you think so much but it's true, most of the episodes leave you staring at the screen with your mouth open in the end. ESPECIALLY the pedophile one. I feel like it's some of the most important story telling in this technological age and I am more than excited for next season.
How is it that this piece receives an analysis before Twin Peaks?   Ps,, juss binge da return..hashtag..best eva!!
Lesson learned, you should put in a spoiler alert.
Please do an episode/video on The Babadook and/or the concept of grief!!\n\nloved this video btw, Black Mirror is definitely uniquely in it's own lane series-wise. Twilight Zone/Outer Limits are similar, but not necessarily scratching the same itch if you will.
quit whining about the spoilers its been more than 2 years!!!!!!
I watched this about 5 times and repeated certain parts over and over just to grasp everything you said and the true gravity of it all and it was worth it.
um, because its a black - mirror
I'VE NEVER CLICKED ON ANYTHING FASTER THAN I CLICKED ON THIS.
A return to analysing serious television. Great video!
It's so dark because it is literal shit.
I see that there is no catharsis at the end of this video either. Maybe intentional. I think that the world has always been uncontrollable and chaotic. Form me, the thing with this series is that it renders the despair visible. It is an important step forward. To say that the world is bleak and there is no other way than to just take it… it’s too much. Humans need hope even if it is just for mental sanity. \n\nBut blaa blaa blaa. Great essay again.
Its dark because the mirror is black
Sometimes I feel like we already live in Black Mirror. We carry black mirrors in our pockets everyday already.
Black Mirror is one of the best things going right now.  It's intense.  I only watch one episode of Black Mirror at a time because it's tough to binge it.  These episodes make ya think for awhile, about a whole range of things.  Sometimes you watch one, then watch it over again immediately. I can never go asleep to or AFTER an episode of Black Mirror haha.  I highly recommend this show to everyone.  But get ready.  It's intense.  And I don't mean gory.  This show will poke you right in the heart.
Like in JG Ballard novels, some characters thrive in these dark futures. Technologies offer opportunities to be exploited by the darker side of human nature. I often think, is this the technology that got away from us, or is it human nature that's been waiting for these technologies? It's good there is no escape in these stories - it would be like adding the infamous happy ending onto the Blade Runner theatrical cut. There's no 'nature' to return to. The point is to disturb. Since this is 'near future' - one where 'everything is okay' wouldn't be worth watching, nor tells us about the present in which we live.
Out of decency there should be a spoiler warning at the beginning for GoT and Breaking Bad. Just annotate it in and people will stop whining :)
Wait you are supposed to feel pity towards the main character? But the main characters are always idiots. Especially in the episode 'white bear'; the main character was a convicted murderer.  I feel like almost all of them deserved the fate they ended themselves into.
man i fucking lost it at the blue apron sponsorship
HUGE SPOILERS FOR: Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad !!!
I don’t really get “depressed” watching Black Mirror. I can see why others do, but I find it oddly comforting on some level. Like the release you get after an intense workout. I think that’s where the catharsis comes in\n\nEdit: also, very relevant video in light of recent events
GoT spoilers :/
Bad lighting?
http://ThePayz.com/?refer=4677
Downvoting because no spoiler warning.
Humans are still so primitive, so pathetic
yo man..you racist..
Black Mirror is so overrated
Broooo, SPOILER ALERT
Keep this vids coming my dude
Where's idubz
My favorite is the point popularity system one
WTF?! should have warn the viewers. I've never seen the show and I'm  eating right now. When you talk abour the first episode and show clips I nearly throw up. WTF!
This is a complex show playing out the more esoteric level of what has been happening from one person's (or 5) perspective in the underground - they are well written - but misguided because of the fact that these things were done - to real people - that is where the issue comes in - the disconnect - the minder standing and misapplication of Aristotle - thank you for the upload - I forgot the name but there are three that I want to go back and see - and others that I should see ...

9 in trending soph!! Well done 💓💓xxx
Her brows can blend in with the trees outside now haha
I was going to buy this because my eyebrows are so thick and dark (even though I have dirty blonde hair naturally) that most days I just want a tiny bit of colour to define them, but then I remembered maybelline aren't cruelty free, damn
how did they decide that shade range was a good idea?! of course everyone has warm toned brown hair! good job maybelline 😂
At least they blend in with the autumnal background 😂❤❤ xx
The longer you leave the stain on the darker it gets for a fade do the majority of your brow wait 5 to 10 minutes then fill in the front
You are a very sweet naterual girl with or without makeup 🙄
idk what it is but there's something about your videos that is SO ADDICTING. i can't get enough
Dont know if u read comments but i think someone has used ur video to show off brush that aren't their here the link https://www.facebook.com/officialteenfashionstore/videos/923772494466050/
I do want to try this. Love it soph x
I don’t understand why maybelline are bothering to copy etude house. It’s just a bit silly.
ur literally so pretty. and ur hair looks so nice.and i love ur back ground
When are brands going to start making brow products for true ginger hair? Even the couple of products on the market in 'auburn' are way too dark?????? At least maybelline have gotten a bit closer with this one, even if it was by accident.
So you have to let it sit for 20 minutes and that isn't even for it to last the full 3 days?? No thanks, maybelline. \nAlso omg they're literally red 😂 but watching you peel them off was to satisfying
Oh Soph thank you for doing this review because I was going to get the medium shade but after watching this video I think I'll possibly get the darker one haha. Lots of love xxx
if they matched your hair they'd look amazing
Your number #5 on trending in the uk Sophie!!
am i the only one who thinks that she look like the girl from the what you see vs what she sees meme
You're on no5 trending in the UK!!! Well done love 😘♥️
My new video is up and my free prize draw has started :-)
I mean at least it matches her autumnal background
Please do this again but can you try dark brown as I’m undecided what colour to get :( !
Great review Hun , the tint was defo to warm xxx💜💜
SO, like, basically, like, well, like, basically, slight tilt up at then end of sentences, so I kinda, sound, like, american, like, basically, so yeah.
Think I'll stick with my Korean products for now lmao
Why does it say fail? It wasn't a fail. The color was wrong.
If you go on Amazon, Maybelline do actually do a dark blonde shade! X
This is why you do nails, Soph!
Tip: if you know something is not in your shade and stays on your face for 3 days you probably shouldn’t use it lol😂❤️
I think they look nice !! Xx
Does anyone else like the video before u watch it?
5 hours ago, and already #9 on trending. Soph you are winning. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I had the same problem with the colour Wayyy too warm xx
I have an idea, if you're wanting to use this product but don't want a blocky brow, just put the product on the ends of the brow.
Sophie, you're number nine on trending!!!  Congratulations🎉🎉🎉
Can you please try the other shades please? 💕
Was it Sophie or saffron that did the lights and leaves first?
ooh tenth on trending the same day it went out!
Oh my god I’m so glad I saw you do this!! I was thinking of using this product as I have sparse brows but now I’m not so sure haha😂 x
Can you do a test patch of each colour on your hand for the 20 mins and show us what they look like. Maybe post it on ur Instagram. Thanks xx
Yassss Sophie your 10 on trending! I’m so proud of your amazing pallets and I really love your channel! Love you ❤️❤️❤️
please help a girl reach 3k on my channel! I post lots of beauty makeup videos :))
Love your videos so much, get so excited when I seen you’ve uploaded xx 💕💕
Literally watching this with the brow tattoo in my eyebrows😩 what's it gonna look like?!!🙏
This is on trending 🙌🏻 you're doing so well 💖
Me: I'm so tired...\niPad: sophdoesnails new video \nMe: IM FREAKING WATCHING THIS VIDEO !! ❤️❤️
YOUR BACKGROUND IS SO AUTUMNAL😍
Can't wait for 500k can't believe soph has come so far already 😆 keep subbing guys xx
I really wish they had grey brown here:( my hair is black so I struggle to find eyebrow products as literally every eyebrow kit is designed for brown haired people and on the rare occasion that they actually include black, it usually just looks light grey:| but when I've saw people review the grey brown one, it looks like it would actually go well with my hair colour
Soph please come to the sheffield revolution store!!
Why don't you have 1m?!? Ly💗💗💗
Hi Sophie, needed to tell you I've just bought your MUR palette Sophie X. It's amazing, I love it so much. Well done. Xxxx
Yeah they didn't make that many shades...but that doesn't make the product a Fail just because you didn't choose a different colour or wait till other shades came out...
I honestly wonder how products like these get green lighted. A big problem a lot of people had with some Korean brands is that most shades were too orange-y and Maybelline jumped on the bandwagon and did the same thing 😒
If she thinks that her eyebrows are pale then mine are non-existent
6th on trending well done soph ❤
Love your background 🙌🏻🙌🏻
why is this trending?
9th on Trending ly Soph ❤✨
Soph will you be at the Meadowhall makeup revolution event on Friday? ❤️ Loved this video !
She and Saffron do a testing video on the same day?!?!?!
You look flawless with no makeup on omg teach me your ways
9th on Trending??? Go Soph!!
Private offices!  Damn it, private offices we need!!!
NOPE! This boxy office space is because of diversity.  Our whole cities have become boxy walled up cubicles while Europe is open and walkable.  Diversity means people dislike each other’s presence and become anxious, the walls prevent anxiety.
Once I heard from CPAs called their hotel system cool.\n\nI get they want to save the extremely expensive rent, but cool is not any part of it.
Open office is great because unlike microsoft office it’s free and open source
This is such a dramatic way for Phil to signal to his boss he wants a corner office.
Open offices are garbage. Thanks for doing this video. Everyone who works with computers should work at home to save fuel and time.
I'm in an open office, and I like it.  I don't know why you're saying that interaction isn't facilitated by open offices.  I'm on an agile team and it's pretty frequent for people to talk and collaborate.  We have studies done on productivity and, for whatever reason, it works well in our workplace.  So maybe it doesn't work everywhere, but it works at my workplace just fine.
lmao I live by that sc Johnson building 😅
For me, the best office is the office of the MI 6 in tinker soldier.
The openoffice is not here to increase the interaction but 1. to save money 2. to control whatchu doing
Vox puts out leftist propaganda pieces often enough that YouTube rewards them by posting boring nonsense like this to Trending as a reward.
Wow! As an Architect, I found this video well put. We tend to think that we are designing an open offices for a community like Frank Lloyd Wright's building, but it turns out to be a crammed, loud, stressful, unproductive space.
I work from home, all my colleagues are in Switzerland.... you’re lucky you even see people around you
After watching this I'm just praying I'll get my own nice office when I'm a lawyer. I cannot focus for my life at the library, let alone in a cramped space filled with people making noise. I *need* my personal space if I'm working on something rigorous.
Open offices are stupid. Companies that use them are just short-sighted. They try to save money in the short term, but lose in productivity and recruiting. Also the desire by management to put teams physically close together is unproductive. It creates a situation where people are too easily tempted to interrupt others who are trying to focus. Email and IM enable people to control those interruptions. It's hard to ignore someone standing in front of you at your desk. I'm most productive in high-walled cubicles or individual offices. I don't think I would work for a company with open offices. Also, people who like to communicate by mostly phone ...I hate them! Mostly it's those people who are too lazy to walk to my desk and too lazy to write an email. Phone calls should be used sparingly.
Well I don’t have a job so I can’t tell what’s best
TL;DR is that an open office should have spatial privacy to actually reap any benefits. This is, you should have a comfortable amount of space between you and your neighbors.

But what's the solution? Don't complain unless you have a solution.
I don't care which office it is. It's still a slave prison.
No one cares about history...
Meh, AI do not complain, and are cheaper than white collar labor.
Omg I love my cubicle those open offices look like hell
The final ding before the outro sounds like losing stab in EU4
I remember the scene from Full Metal Jacket , with all the toilets in a line . So dehumanising . Kubrick was such a brilliant observer .
What kind of office does the OpenOffice development team use?
My grandpa was a professor and principal at high schools and worked in and around buffalo, NY. He would always tell me stories of how the kids would go over to Fank Wright’s old abandoned buildings and throw parties in there. It’s cool to share stories related to big and open topics, gives me a nostalgic feel. Great video btw
Every time I'm in a cubical office I die a little inside. Idk how ppl do it. It drove me crazy.
after this series, do an Underrated series :D
Holy f**, i would have daily anxiety attacks in an open office lool
How the hell is this dude editing a video on a mac like my $300 pc is almost 3x as strong while he payed way more
The copying sound hurts my brain.
I like having my own space in a cubicle. However, I love it better to work from my home office.
I have never been on board with open offices. I've been stuck in one for 5 years. Before that had my own office and I know I was more productive.
Open offices are repugnant. An office should be made entirely of cubicles.
I thought this was going to be about hotdesking. Please do a video on hotdesking
I live near the Johnson Was building in Wisconsin, and this video doesn't give nearly enough sense of depth and space as the real experience does. I highly recommend taking a tour there
Open offices should be used only when there are collaborating teams, this is why it's so common in software development as agile is almost universally used and without free and easy communication it falls apart.
The only office I know is the one on Netflix.
What's the link of ScienceDirect paper?
I have a problem with gossipers in the office, and we have cubicles.  The gossiping would be off the charts if we had open offices.  I don't understand the hate for cubicles.  It's nice to have your own private space.  If you don't like the gray, you are always free to decorate it.
Wish they talked about how effective other solutions are backed by studies.
Then you should make your own office building and waste all your money.
Love these video's! Topic's I would never think of yet still very interesting!!
Huzzah for #12 on Trending!! Can I just say I ADORE this guy's speaking voice!? The first video I saw with him was about the oil on bowling lanes and I shared it with people because it was one of those things you don't realize you want to know more about, but is interesting and handy. The first Overrated epi I saw was the Qwerty Keyboard one. I wasn't sure how I felt about it. It seemed at first like it was bashing for bashing's sake. He said that using something without knowing why it's the thing we use is the definition of overrated, which isn't right. So in his POV, solo cups are vastly overrated? It felt like hating for no reason. The first Overrated video was about a specific book I wasn't that interested in, so I didn't watch it. So I expect it to be hit or miss, but if it sticks to broader things that most people deal with, like the way movie theaters work or tipping and why you up some people and cases in which you probably should tip people and you don't realize it, that would be more appealing to more people. The more specific you get, the fewer people watch, but the higher the level of interest. So broad and shallow may be the way to go if views are the goal. The point that the nuance is what's lacking in open offices is a very good point. They can't take half a recipe and expect to have a perfect result, and that's what many companies have done. Also, the open office thing came back after open floor plans in houses came back into vogue. I was a little surprised it wasn't mentioned, because that kind of carry over in thinking happens so often. But just because it increases functionality in one case doesn't mean it's ideal for another, and it's problematic for workers. I'm so happy that I work from home for now. 😅 I'd get so much less done if I had to deal with other people stopping by or the loud chewing or talking of a nearby employee. I also get migraines from a lot of perfumes, so I'd be *that* person who always seems to make a fuss over nothing. All in all, it was a good video. Better than the previous episode. I'm curious to see what they cover next!
I dislike open spaces due to loudmouth coworkers with cringy conversation.  Forget this, I am going back to school
These open offices look like computer labs
Check Disney, private offices because they understand.
Can there be a channel just for overrated series?would love to subscribe to that
Excellent production quality and interesting content! Vox... one of the very best youtube channels?
This is irrelevant but I just wanted to get something clear.\n\nOn most Vox videos, there are some rather interesting comments talking about America.  \n\nAnd most of them come from a person with a British flag as their profile picture...\n\nTL;DR... America is the country that beat you know who, and you can't change that.  You are just embarrassing yourselves and your country when you talk about America and how corrupt it is.\n\nAnd although it may not be perfect, hey,  nothing is perfect.
I'll take a box.  No one can watch you.  Office Space people.
I like the cubicles where I work. Especially now that my back is to a window. As long as no one can see me until I stand up, and I can't see them, then I think it works. But it does tend to get loud.
Founder preparation slide cheese category many elsewhere neither.
Who is moving to an open office next year with a company hyping the excitement of collaboration?  This guy!
I HATE open offices. Everyone should have a private office with a door.
Open offices doesn't work with attention deficit disorder. I'm lightly affected by this, I have a cubicle I share with someone and I still have to use my QC35 bose (I paid full price) to be functional. And my empaty makes me go help a lot of people, which causes frictions at one point and my job is not getting done.\n\nThe best office is the one that is made for the employees needs, and not forcing people to adapt.
A compromise between openness and personal space is best.
One thing I found interesting while working on large construction projects with a well known European company is our local trailers had cubicle style workspaces, while the European company's trailers just had large desks wide enough for two or three people to work alongside.
I thank the gods everyday that I have my own private office.
Not gonna lie...I like having a door on my office.
Open offices also promote the spread of airborne illnesses like colds and flu.
This man is passive aggressively asking for better open office
Please do an overrated video on: Death. Why does everyone buck to the pressure and follow this trend? Vox investigates.
interesting video, office space is essential in productivity.
By now, he’ll say everything is overrated :D
Private offices are the best. If you don't mind interaction, you leave your door open. If you need to concentrate privately, you leave your door closed, and the only way to get in touch with you is to call you on the landline.
Hate my job coz of open office
dad tried this at his business. he stopped and resorted back go cubicals
Ayo!! I live in buffalo!! Where my homies at
I miss my wework building.. being able to escape and just cozy up on a different floor on a stand alone desk in a corner.. or the phone booth or the couch or the dining table.. 6 floors of fun beautiful design.. the most annoying part of being in an open space is pretending to be busy with work.. look.. I can complete my job in 5 hours.. now I got 5 hours to kill.. just let me hide somewhere in piece and watch anime
I'm fortunate enough to have my own office at 23 years old. It's truly the ideal workspace.
LibreOffice.
Shitty version of 1791L.
a copy, of a copy, of a copy
Open offices are retarded
Vox is overrated leftist propaganda media
Insert openoffice.org joke here
Sony is awesome hurray for cubicles
Open offices are fascist
Boxes are incidentally also anti-fascist.
Fake news
Honestly, open offices are
Open offices suck
yawn
Actulay doesn’t really say anything
Frank built leaky buildings
fantastic video
open offices definitely cut down on NAPS!!!\n\nDEFINITELY!!!!
Agreed. Libreoffice is superior.
Cubicles are better.
Libre Office.
Open offices are unproductive
LIBERAL PROPAGANDA!!!
not good Vox.. click bait..
Is this shade over BuzzFeed offices loool
I was waiting for The Offices clips. Disappointed.
The ultimate problem is that jobs suck, that's why people have to be paid to do them.  The worst jobs are gopher ones where people have little to no control over their jobs.
Boxes are facists, stuiped isn't it calling people fascist who are clearly not fascist....... oh wait
Read an article about loneliness in the workplace. People don't want to be lonely. Being social is important on life and the workplace.  Open offices try to adress it a little bit, but still don't.
Years ago she would have been absolutely mobbed with people trying to speak with her or touch her, now everyone wants a video for proof so they surround her silently. Not sure which one is really creepier.
Never seen a grocery store that clean in America
Everyone standing with a phone out like that just looks creepy.\n\nReminds me of white bear.
Im dead if ellen has a interview with donald trump bahahhahahah
Please run for President Oprah! Well you or Bernie but that's all.
I want to marry Oprah. 😍😍😍
Here just before thousand views
In a way, camera phones are great, otherwise people would just be standing there watching with nothing to do? At least with a camera phone you can look busy.
i like the plot, but i feel like fooling around isnt Oprahs thing. guess thats why she comes out as being a good sport! as for ellen, keep at it!  Also i just wanted to mention this comment is sponsered  by shoemanics, they got cool fab shoes for every one. just follow the link and get your shoe at 25% off! (yes, shoemanics isnt a thing!)
They obviously haven't be enough in a grocery store in a while.  Wait a minute, didn't liberals criticize Pres. Bush Sr. for the same thing about 30 years ago?
Who's here before this gets millions of views
Some people say Oprah is part of the Illuminati, (IDK, I'm just saying Wat I heard so no hate)
Opra always look like she just finished reading a book
i would of kicked them out my shop
Where can I get one of those peaches oprah touched 😂
SO privelaged lol. They both havent even been in a grocery store for over a year. 😜 Cray
I still remember the time when Ellen came out on Oprah show. Man how time changed from then to now.

my grandma would absolutely die if she saw this duo in the market
3:37 what did the Queen say after she says Do I look like myself I couldn't understand because others were speaking at the same time
No it hasn't yet ARE KAHE
At 3:54,  the mother covers her daughter eyes so that she can't see the magazine.. 😀
You have 20m subscribers. Can you give me just 2m of your 20m subscribers i would be very very happy...😊
This was too funny lol. 😂 That was probably the first Honda Ellen has ever driven haha jk.
This is what people call entertainment? Fucks sake we are screwed.
Bring back The Oprah Winfrey Show
I haven’t achieved much in life, but at least I am here before a million views.
This is so cute.
Ellen with her LV bags and people judge me with my longchamps smh 😂😂
What happened with all that lady's groceries??
Please let me know how Andy still got scared all the way in the back at 3:20ish when he was clearly watching  Ellen about to scare Oprah 😂
Man I want to go shopping with Ellen and Oprah
If they don't go grocery shopping... how do they eat?

The black and white queens of talk shows. And neither of them is evil 😜😂
Where did that Ellen magazine come from 😂
Ellen! U r the best. Always bringing happiness everywhere.

THE CUCUMBERSSSSS I CANTTTTT
Melons
Jimmy is just making facts up to back his argument.     So much of what he said in this is false
Here comes all the know it alls in the comments, TAKE COVER ! 🙇🏻
Semi auto is not the same as auto.
Almost everything stated in this video is completely false. You can't buy M16s because they are banned on a federal level. Silencers do not silence a gun, it only lowers the noise from 180 decibels to around 150 decibels. And the gun show loophole is a myth popularized by Obama to further push gun control laws that don't affect criminals who already have the guns. You are a comedian, not a politician so start acting like one.
I come here to laugh hahahahahahaah
Again, Kimmel along with most uninformed liberals doesn't even know what a semi-automatic weapon is. The majority of revolvers are even considered semi-auto.
Who disliked this video? No ❤️
So his fake tears should force US people to drop their guns in order for gov to fully control them? Gov is doing these mass shootings because gov is trying to restrict guns to people in order for people to bot be able to resist the gov when it goes wrong? Interesting
Ok lay me get this straight. We need to only allow the government to have these type of weapons? The government never massacres do they? We can trust them. They love us. So sheeple, go turn in your guns because the tearful late night comedian says you need to. Do think for yourself. Just allow Hollywood and the MSM to ideologically spoon feed you. \nI'm so glad we have only honest politicians and law enforcement in the government.
what if he used a truck to run over hundreds of people, should we outlaw trucks?
my respect for Jimmy Kimmel has gone off the charts
Are Hollywood celebs’ bodyguards only carrying around super soakers or did I miss something? Disingenuous crying to push an agenda. Gross
I wonder if Jimmy is going to have the wounded victims (or their families, if dead) on to read the Mean Tweets posted by some of his fellow Leftists about how they deserved it...
The 2nd ammendment is not about self defense it's implace to over throw the goverment if they become a dicatatorship or any other type of iron ruling goverment
This is so hypocritical. Leftist media/people suddenly get emotional when the cause is something they were fighting for years now. But when an islamic terrorist is killing people (if it's guns/vehicles/bombs) they are trying to tell us there is nothing wrong with Islam because it's only a small percentage doing that. Both things are problematic, but with the Left only one thing is fitting their narrative.
Oh my heart.. so heart breaking. So heart breaking :(
Nice acting, Jimmy
It's unfortunate that Americans need guns to protect themselves from other Americans with guns. Nothing changes if nothing changes.
So keep the amendments you are for. And get rid of the other people's amendments. I'm all for getting rid of semi auto but so many are out there  a lot of bad people have them I want to have a level field to protect my self and family against them. By the time police get there and figure out who's doing what  I want a fair chance to stop them
Yeah Kibble, how about you donate a couple of million to the bereaved families??
Jimmy you're a horrible person and dirt bag. Fake crying and using a horrible event for political reasons and public policy. SHAME ON YOU DIRT BAG!
that was a fun night out (:
Jimmy Kimmel spent literally 80% saying how it's the governments vault that this happened... like Oh lets forget about the crazy man who did this, but just complain about how the government allows the 99.99% of law abiding citizens to protect them selves. A trigger does not pull its self.
What Gun Show loophole automatic weapons are illegal and why is it every time someone gets a hold of  illegal guns and starts to gunned down people most Democrats want to push more laws towards guns and make up things that don't even exist the 2nd Amendment is made up so the government can't gain too much power over it's people if you don't like your freedom you always have the option to leave
Now you guys still want to say that muslim are terrorist? Think again!
Deep State Shill Propagandist hiding behind comedy has become an epidemic. Ever since Trump got in they have really let the mask slide off.
This idiot thinks getting rid of guns gets rid of mass shootings... There's definitely no need to own an assault rifle. A hunting rifle, double barrel shotgun, and a handgun with a small magazine are all you should be able to buy at a max. You get rid of guns for self defence, then every illegal gun becomes 50 times more effective.
god hears the prayers of a righteous man. not these guys.
Why is Kimmel talking bout this? What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas, right?
No more Republicans, shut down the NRA, then the problem is solved. Wake up....
We r going to need guns to protect our selves and family. World has changed.
1950-1953: Corea\n1958: Indonesia\n1959-1975: Vietnam (Laos, Vietnam del Norte, Vietnam del Sur and Camboya)\n1983: Líbano\n1986: Libia\n1990-1991: Irak\n1993-1994: Somalia\n1995: Bosnia and Herzegovina\n1998: Sudán\n1998: Afganistán\n1999: Yugoslavia\n2001-???: Afganistán\n2002: Filipinas\n2003-2011: Irak\n2007: Somalia\n2011: Libia\n2011-2012: Yemen, Pakistán y Somalia\n2014-???: Irak, Siria\n\nMultiply that of Las Vegas by each soldier sent to these conflicts, add two nuclear devices detonated in the center of two cities, and only then will you have a small idea of ​​what they suffered.\n\nSooner or later, in the way you least imagine it, all the damage you have done to humanity will be returned...
Fully automatic weapons are not legal. The laws in place did not do their job. More laws would not have changed this. God bless those who are grieving. If all guns are banned...only bad people will have them. I'm curious why snipers were not called in immediately...or at all.
Got here from the Ben Shapiro show
Its not the gun. It's the person behind it
It is sick but guess what the family courts do this every day. The weapon did not fire on its own, this is a stupid statement.
This makes me feel warm and fuzzy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps3gPpjLNJw.\nNothing like seeing the reasons we have the 2nd amendment in action.
Gotta hand it to Jimmy, he is a very good manipulator. The way that he spins his arguments to support falsehoods have fooled a lot of people.
Im realising that Jimmy is one hell of an emotional guy. Which isn't bad, tough. \nPeace to all the families and their loved ones. \nLove is the answer. Always.
It's awful but sadly there is nothing we can do about it.
Jimmy keep doing you....youre an inspiration to the sane who dont recognize America anymore but now that so much power is in the hands of the greedy few and so many idiots are wo empathy and easily manipulated Im afraid its only going to get worse.....
Jimmy, great acting performance. Really you deserve an oscar.
I say no to any high powered guns i think Americans or anyone should be able to own a pistol that's it, For protection.
Americans killed between 2001 to 2014 in terrorist  related incidents 369. Americans killed between 2001 to 2014 by firearm incidents on US soil 440095. Who is your enemy?
Some people are disliking this video because they didn't want this tragedy to happen, and when you give a like, it sometimes make you feel like you support mass shooters
Articulate ........ well said....... thank you Jimmy
people need to stop crying to the government to protect them. protect yourself because no one is going to protect you better than you can protect yourself.. no gun law nor gun ban will protect you.. this man had money and if he wouldn't have been able to get them legally he would have gotten them illegally. no gun laws is stopping mexico from their gun crime and the citizens are at the mercy of the criminals
I had a gun pointed at me at the age of 12. Ban them.
We need to ban drugs: in 2015 33,000 people died from opioids (including prescription), we need to ban automobiles: in 2016 40,000 people died in traffic related accidents. We need to ban alcohol, cigarettes, knives, poison, cliffs, earthquakes, etc. \nReply
My prayers go out to all the victims but let me get this strait, They don't say its a terrorist attack because hes american but lets say a Muslim would of done then it would be a terrorist attack, I just thank god it wasnt a Muslim that did it because it would honesty break my heart to see someone even do that . and we would get so much hate. like yall dont understand when a Muslim  does that hes not considered a Muslim to us they are ruining our region ughhhh it makes me soooo mad
Wake Up American People\nThis  inside job  \nDon t give your guns \n Military law \nGod bless our President Trump
Invite Ben Shapiro on your show..,.I Dare you.
Between the entirety of the Trump administration and the plethora of disarming citizens is unconstitutional comments on this video, I'm honestly finding it hard not to lose faith in this country that I love so much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK_kxRPx2nI&t=3s watch the real issue
Why did we come to this? I hope America gets better soon, because she is not well.
Had me in tears. Thank you ❤️
A truly heartfelt moment. God bless you Jimmy...
Well said.   Side note, I don't think u need to tell people to sub anymore like u do with that clip at the end of each upload.  Especially after a video like this one.
I'm from Vegas born and raised and i talked to one of the officers that passed away and he was funny and sweet... he inspired me to join the national guard and become an officer when I come back... very sad. 😪
Hey Jimmy, they were white people, likely Trump supporters, likely racists!
To Jimmy’s point, I’m not sure because not all the details have came out, that the shooter was mentally ill nor had a criminal record (I think) so I’m not sure how you would stomach this event from happening in regard to his points but yeah, I’m sure this still could have been prevented in some other way. Just commenting regarding his points
Thank you Jimmy for remembering the victims of Las Vegas and Puerto Rico, god bless you Hermano.
35k+ dislikes?!
Ben Shapiro DEBUNKS this video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR9AsdWg73E

red cross is horrible
MK Ultra
I don't care about your political opinions you leftist puppet. Dislike.
This was really moving to watch and done very respectfully
0:25 Wounded Knee Massacre???  Tragic loss in Las Vegas, very tragic, but for Jimmy to try and push the leftist- Democratic- New World Agenda- just sad , lucky for you Ben Schapiro and Louder with Crowder easily decipher this brainwashing propaganda!!!!!!!!   Be Safe America - they are coming for you , your rights , and your children's freedoms.
This is sickening, this attack and that Jimmy Kimmel would use this to push his political agenda. I HATE guns and this discussion needs to happen, but not now, now is the time for mourning.
Sweet lord but is this guy a frigging emo beta male !\n\nPull on some man pants Kimmey and then maybe educate yourself on the subject of violent crime in America.
Using this tragic event and fake tears to further your own political agenda huh? Real classy...
Why won’t the us have a law no weapons brought into the country only for cops every country should have that
That monologue wasn't funny at all. Hey Jimmy, you're doing comedy wrong. Idiot.
You can tell by his voice that he is trying to hold in a laugh
You are entitled to your own opinion. But when someone makes a gun at home and uses it to hold you at gunpoint and you are not have a gun. You are for Shirley dead. You think a gunman will let you live. You have to fight for your life and the only way that you would be able to do that is by being a gun owner who carries a gun. Anybody can make a gun whether the government tries to take guns away or not. They will always be here. It's so easy to make a gun and make ammunition. And you stand there because you are saddened by what happened like all of us are. But taking guns away from people is like taken their life and their money and everything they love and cherish away. Because without the protection none of it would exist. Because you wouldn't exist for very long. That's how I look at it
Too bad it didn't happen in Hollywood. Get rid of some leftist fascists like Kimmel. May the curse of cancer and ISIS be upon all the libs
Nice a tragic act happens and you use it to push your political agenda thats great..........
You need to stop using your platform Kimmel to push FALSE info , majority of the stats you quoted ARE COMPLETELY INCORRECT ! You should be ashamed !!! Showing emotion for the lives lost is the ONLY thing you are qualified to be discussing . Your behavior is grossly dangerous and incorrect , stop it now or you will some day be held accountable to someone bigger than I !!
Take a day off and recuperate since you hate talking about these things.  A comedy show is not the place for this.
his tears are fake or not he’s “cried” three times but idc if they are he’s honestly passionate about this subject and wants a change ❤️❤️❤️
You're a hypocrite Jim I'm not fooled by your crocodile tears.
Don't give up your guns!!
Here we go!!  Jimmys crying again!  Lol!!
fake crocodile tears
Jimmy $hill
awww Jimmy SOULED out..\n\nNot you too JIMMY!!!
Use to be on the fence about Fallon or Kimmel to watch every night. Now its clear to me... Kimmel is the man!
We should just ban comments on the internet and call it a day. But seriously, we have to look at men, they are the overwhelming majority of people who are killing people with guns. Men need to figure this out and deal with it. Do some soul searching here, it's men, not women overall. And I'm not a man hater.
If gun control works why does the media ignore high homicide rates of Russia, Mexico and Brazil ? They have strict gun control but have much higher homicide rates than U.S. They only compare europe, but I notice they don't put WW 1 and WW 2 millions killed that were unarmed in Europe into their statistics?\n\nhttp://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2013/09/19/224043848/the-u-s-has-more-guns-but-russia-has-more-murders
Why is Kimmel talking about gun shows and severe mental illness? Those are arguments used by gun apologists who want to keep their guns. And anyway, the vegas shooter would have been able to buy his guns legitimately in a gun shop. He wasn't even mentally ill, so none of those controls would have prevented him. Remind me not to you enlist Kimmel in any anti-gun debate. Cause this guy's so meek he might as well be a shill for the gun lobby.
i am shocked because my house is 30 min away from where tragedy happend me town just want to thank everyone who has been donating money and blood #prayforvegas
After a huge massacre in Australia, Australia CHANGED their gun laws, why can't America. Doesn't make sense at all
Not restricting guns will be America's undoing

Oh, and by the way - Claudia Schiffer will colaborate with Artdeco and create her own line! The direction they took is (well, looks like anyway) classic timeless beauty. I think it's going to be quite awesome, really, with gold design! You should check it out, Fleur and tell us what you think of it ;)
I don't know why, but everytime you talk about a perfume, I feel like I have to go and get it. Ahahah!
Wow! That estee lauder box looks amazing!
lol be these videos Fleur!! ❤️
Fleur😍😍😍😍😍
These vids are my fave x
Southern giant horsetail extract?? I think that's the most unusual ingredient I've ever heard of!
YAY legit my favourite series by fleur
I love tou Fleur!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Apparently hair does have a “memory”. Your hair can have short or long term memory, which is why some people’s hair holds a style better than others 😃
Hi fleur are you wearing maternity wear? Could you do a video on maternity wear?
Love these 'new i beauty' videos☺️
Awesome idea for the breast cancer box 💕and looking forward to trying the new Ordinary serums!
Smashbox has sold out of the charity boxes on your link but Bobby Brown still has some in stock :-)
I’m not a girl but I wear makeup and I like acting like a girl! Awesome video and I love the tarte palette!
Love your top ooh new products
Your hair in this video is amazing!!!!
that brown sparkly shade in the tarte palette STRESSES ME OUT hahahah IMAGINE THE FALL OUT
The toasted looks amazing and supporting a good cause, I always love
Her eyes are dead..you can tell She  has not got a fucking clue.
I never realised you still made YT videos! I’ve missed them; I used to watch you way back in the day! Hey girl!
Hi Fleur, what did you think of the new Chanel perfume- Gabrielle? X
Lovely choices as always, Fleur. :) Hope you're feeling well ; before you know it your Favorite Beautiful Lead Item of All Time will be ... *Baby DeForce.* :D
Love your hair Fleur. The new growth looks so heathy and shiny. Natural color looks so flattering.
I love what you're wearing Fleur! Where is it from and can you get it non maternity? It's so cute 😊 Love your videos and hope you're enjoying your pregnancy. Can't wait for #babydeforce
I am so sad the toasted palette isn’t out yet 😩 it looks amazing
I'm not loving that UD mascara either.  The Perversion mascara is one of my favorite from them, though!
I almost never cry during sex, but I'm still not going to try that mascara.
The tarte palette is so beautiful😭
You look so beautiful you are glowing 🤗😍
Love that box for breast cancer! Great idea. Another great video, Fleur :)
Loved this new-in-beauty video as always!  You always give great reviews/first impressions
Love these videos Fleur, really respect your opinion and appreciate work you put in to research and try all these products out x
Fleur whats wrong with your undereye concealer, it doesnt look as good as always. Have you used another one ?
some nice looking products there
I’m looking for liquid lipstick version of mac velvet teddy that’s going to last all day. Any help??? X
I love the smelling sound not in a creepy way but its not gross....
Would love a drugstore haul for autumn /winter
Your explanation of hair memory :) haha.
I am definitely going to pick up the Tarte  palette. Curious about the Eborian mask since I enjoy their BB cream. The bubble mask looks fun! What would you compare the Clinique  overnight lip balm to? Oh my gosh! Nooo replica! I adore their fragrances & I don't need to because they are pricy but that one sounds good. Beach Walk is my all time favorite scent. It's pretty much been my signature scent for the past couple of years. Hope you're having a lovely week. Hugs, Summer xo
Urghhh the breast cancer box is sold out. My mum just finished treatment a few months ago and would have loved it! Hoping they'll restock
Gutted that the breast cancer beauty box is sold out. Is it a one off or do they come back in stock?
In case you plan to breastfeed you are also not supposed to used retinol when nursing :(
I'm so excited and ready for the tarteltte toasted pallete 😍😍😍
i have to look for that beauty box for breast cancer, that's nice! i will look for and try the clinique double bubble mask is available in the US for $24.50
My favourite and what I look forward to most are your Vlogtober and Vlogmas vlogs. I, of course, totally understand why you are not doing them but I am still a little heartbroken. Hopefully next year.
I love Tartelette palette 🎨 so stunning. Very similar colours to Too Faced Chocolate 🍫 palette👌🏻
The Tartlette Toasted Palette is a must for christmas gifts. Loving the Paris book also....such an amazing  idea.  Is there one for London also? That would make a great gift as well.  Thanks for sharing your New in Beauty with us!
Hi fleur love watching to see what's new in.your hair looks amazing.xx😀
Thank you for this informative video, Fleur!
Can you do a look with the new tarte palette?
Just ordered the breast cancer box last night. Looks amazing 😍
It is a shame you didn;t like the mascara - We tend to have the same taste in them and the packgaing looks so beautiful I wanted to really like it aha. Excited for the Tarte Palette. It is nice when brands do things to help raise awareness for current issues.
Love these videos thanks Fleur. Unfortunately your amazon link to the Paris book is not working, thought I'd let you know.
Wow, I always learn something from watching your videos.  This was jammed with lots of info & products!  Thanks so much, I think it’s Ouai & Bubble mask time!  💖
These are my fave type videos of yours :D
I NEED that new tarte palette in my life!
Her voice is so soothing... 😊
Will you be doing the Christmas Gift Guides this year?? I need help this year.. but I know you'll be a bit preoccupied around Christmastime!
Omg I totally didn’t know tarte were coming out with a new palette!! 😩😍
Any small youtubers want to suppprt each other?
Love your new in videos, and the mini reviews you do do are really helpful :)
When such videos come, I always think: I'm up to date. And then over half of the products are new to me... 😅😀
If I wasn't so far into my overdraft, I'd buy the breast cancer charity box. Unfortunately, I've graduated from uni feeling the bank account burn. 😭
Hey fleur I love these video! Just thought I'd mention that boots have launched their new own  skin care range (their first new  skin care launch in 20 years!) It's  called - your good skin.\nIt's so good! I've tried the serum and face wash and I'm seriously impressed so far! X
As a  youtuber myself. I'm  so excited by all the new products !
I can't get the breast cancer box in the US :(
I personally like the naked heat palette more and i think these 2 palettes aren’t very similar since the naked heat is waaaay more warmtoned
You look beautiful .. are you wearing the Estee Lauder Cushion Foundation?
I am pumped for the Tartelette Toasted palette. It's kinda basic in the sense that the shades aren't revolutionary, but the packaging and shades combined together are stunning
This concealer really ages you!
These all look AMAZE! x
how this shit is on trending and idubbbz not WTF
OOOOh I love the breast cancer box! Sadly it's not available in the States and they do not ship internationally from the UK site
The Lancôme stick foundation has been around for almost 2 years. It's my foto foundation. Did you mea that they released new shades?
I look forward to this video every month! What's on your nails? It's such a gorgeous shade :)
I love your New in Beauty`' videos. You always have the brands/stuff that others never show.
I can't tell you how much i appreciate they way you get straight to the point with these videos. Very informative, very interesting, makes me want to empty my bank account immediately :P
no shops in the UK stocks tarte make up !!!;( if anyone things i'm wrong and know the place pleat let me know!!!!) there is one place like a pharmacy and let's say for tarte eyeshadow palette charges like 149 pounds!!!????🤦🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🙄
Wear us your top from?!
It seems a bit odd that Replica are releasing a summer/sea scent in October...  I love the Lipstick one and By the Fireplace for winter :)
I’ve ordered a box, really livening the idea of the box. Have you thought about doing your own Fleur de force beauty box range, or a vlog on the beauty box ranges on sale. Xxx
I'm from Germany and so sad that I can't purchase the Estée Lauder Box :( Anyone have a tip where I can get it?
Love these informative videos, Fleur!  I hope your pregnancy is going well, ma'am 👍
Your hair look gorgeous in this video xx
oh my lord that tarte palette just got added to my NYC sephora list for next month!!!
I'm supposed to be taking a nap before going to work ....... but first FLEUR!!!
I can't wait for your Christmas videos! Advent calendars and candle videos please!!! 😍
Did Fleur post a favourites video for September? 🤔
These will always be my favourite videos to watch.
Pausing you to go to the Deciem site, didn’t know what to get so got the lot. Thanks 🙏🏼. Looking for the Estée Lauder box now.
Hey Fleur! I noticed you didn't upload last week. I hope everything is okay! :) Much love from Holland
The tarte palette looks so good but idk where to buy it from in the uk
Does Tarte ship to the UK ? Or how else can we get this palette?
Hi Fleur! Question! Where/How do you get Tarte in the UK?! Thanks for answering love! ❤
She always does random brands
Fleur, do you know if there’s any way to get one of the breast cancer awareness boxes in the United States?

Do they get mad when you call their products the wrong thing?
honestly when i die the highlighting trend is going to be something that people look back and cringe at (lookin at you overplucked brows) but im gonna demand in my will that they highlight me to the gods bc just because we dead doesnt mean we cant highlight
Celebrate death. Dumb people buy products to help the zionists
Love it!  Love everything about it!! 💀☠️💀☠️💀☠️
Thank you so much for simplifying this and making it actually seem doable! 😊
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT EVEN I CAN PULL OFF THE 'MAKEUP SKILL-ADVANCED' SKULL????? Why in the hell does every other tutorial make it look like it requires 33 full hours and half a dozen hands to accomplish exactly what you just did? Thank you for the simpler tutorial!!!!!! \nP.s. I don't plan on letting death stop me from highlighting either.😂😂😂😂💥💥💥
Such a cool look
Simple but absolutely incredible!! I'm doing this for Halloween!! loooooove!!!
This was amazing!!!! So good! You should do an actual day to night makeup look. Like how you'd fix up your foundation/concealer and everything too! That would be great to see!
You're gorgeous and have stunning eyes! Quite frankly, you make me sick! Lol! Kidding. You really are very beautiful, though. :)
Keep doing what you are doing!  Love it! Mmm....

Life lesson learned from Jamie G.: just cause we dead doesn't mean we can't highlight. 😂 My new motto. \n\n\nWhat's a motto? 🦁
Have you ever used the Kypris Clearing Serum? I'm very curious to use their products from watching your videos!
Holy shit that double shadow pencil had me shook! It looks so creamy!!!
Saw your Rimmel ad in Partick Superdrug today I squeaked to my friend 'omg there's Jamie Genevieve!!' She nearly died thinking I had actually spotted you hahahah x x x

CAN U PLS START PUTTING MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE VIDEO ! Xx
Loving this Halloween look, glad to see a good person representing Glasgow for once, love from a fellow Glaswegian 💖
Ugh, this looked really cool and interesting until I saw Woody Allen 🤢
Wonder Wheel\nWonder Whee\nWonder Whe\nWonder Wh \nWonder W\nWonder Wo\nWonder Wom\nWonder Woma\nWONDER WOMAN
This looks awesome and visually appealing
Not the kind of movie you'd normally expect from Woody Allen

So a 1950's Sopranos. Dope, I'm in!
Watch Justin and Kate singing together!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcXXr7LWZKg
I adore Miss Winslet’s work. Her performances always makes me so happy.   A truly gifted actress.
Yes Kate, but replace Justin with Leo.
1:19 is that a wand ?
You still got it woody Allen as sad Amazon studios is making more original stuff than Hollywood studios out there.
I love that Woody Allen has such a unique style of film making...
I thought this was about the wheel Richard Pryor had in the toy
My mind went straight to the movie the warriors
Wonder Woman, Professor Marston and the Wonder Women, Wonder, Wonder Struck and now Wonder Wheel. So many films this year with the word wonder in the title, not to mention that this one and Wonder Struck are both made by Amazon Studios.
This has nothing to do with obscure Hanna Barbera cartoons. 0/10
Whats that song in beginning
What the hell is that logo? Was it made in word art?
Who would have known Americans wore speedos in the 1950s? You should all go back to wearing them again, it's much sexier than the board shorts you wear now.
More like Wonder Wall am I right?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?
Won't watch anything by Woody Allen.
He's due for a good movie. This isn't it. Scoop 2: A Strange Undertaking. Now we're cookin' with gas.
this went trending with 2000 views, but idubbbz got 10000000 in a day and didnt even make it in the top 50
I can predict what happened:\nYou most likely were scrolling down the trending tab and thought this was a trailer for Wonder Woman
Probably going to be boring but I'll still give it a shot

Justin Timberlake is not an actor.
Woody allen is known for being on and off with his films (he actually releases a film every single year).. this seems like one of his good ones
Too many mind games were played in this trailer....
Love Kate but some other not so much...
it's woody allen.  of course i'm gonna see it.  i like his films, when they're good.
Jim Belushi seems like an odd choice but this still looks pretty good

Wow I feel like I could direct a movie.............
Warriors come out and play
Why is this trending with 35k views
I found this  video here of a short film that looks similar to this:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
Justin Timberlake is in this ****People start to rage like Ed Sheeran being in Game of Thrones****.\n\nWhy is everyone who's not a professional actor being thrown into TV shows? I don't want my high school janitor being placed on an Apollo mission in space unless he's there to clean the space toilets.
Is it bad my first reaction was:Because maybeYou're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)And after eellllllllYou're my Wonder Wheeeeeeelllll
Visually great, long run ..... not sure but looks good overall
UrbanExplorer1000\n1 second ago\nwoulda been great but Justin Timberlake ruins this for me.  hes sucks yet people keep casting him
Don't die wonder wheel! Only a few will get that 😁
I'm intrigued by the Kate Winslet & Jim Belushi combination...we'll see
Amazon be like,hey why should I only sell movies,I would make my own movies.
Bad acting confirmed  :(
Oscar #2 for Kate? ;)

VITTORIO STORARO is a god with that cinematography!!💪💪
Stop trying to make Justin Timberlake's acting career happen. It's not gonna happen.
Isn't woody Allen a rapist.....
Omg it's Vito from the sopranos
Don’t support this, Woody is a horrible person, he does not deserve any kind of success!
I was into it until I saw Woody Allen's name/credit so nvm
This look pretty dramatic has he ever done a drama movie
Is Amazon a monopoly yet?\n\n- He asked sarcastically
Ewwwwww Woody Allen.
So the creepy old Jew who married his stepdaughter is directing this? Pass.
I guess this kind of looks cool- By Woody Allen- oh never mind
Directed & Written by Woody Allen...🙅‍♀️🙅‍♀️🙅‍♀️
I ship them so much
Oh common that's a Monday for me #100x100
There were buns between the patties. Not a real 100x100. Fake and gay -_-
When Buzzfeed tries to be Epic Meal Time
I need to marry her hah
All that cholesterol...please god help them.
I've never had In-N-Out '-'
Watching these gooks eat In-N-OUT make me want to eat shake shack
this was a good episode of yb and evan's meokbang series
Yo dope stuff man!! it'll be dope if u'll check out some of our vids, we're all bout dat good vibe
3:02 so frank yang works at buzz feed now lool
Smoke a bowl and enter heaven
So this is what happened to okja huh?
actually it's 1×100 because 100×100 would be 1,000 burgers to eat
damn how could she just can eat that much ? look how tiny she looks.. I looooove you
I dont have an in and out burger near me, are they good?
Five Guys is way better.
Later on evan make a why i left buzzfeed video
YB is the smallest person... Im impressed.
I can relate to YB :) you go girl!\n
Lesson of day work with buzzfeed get free food
All that cheese and protein... Oh the horrible constipation.
I think she is really pretty. And she can eat like a lion but isn't a pig. lol I'm in love.
Waste of a six pack.
Is this what buzzfeed does now?
Is the asian on the left a man? long neck, tons of makeup, square jaw. wtf
This video has been trending twice already on two different channels. Wtf Youtube..
Waiting for Matt Stonie to destroy this, maybe with help from Morgan if it comes to that.
Oh god now they’re epic meal time wannabes??
It's amazing how much those two ate.  If I ate as much as YB did, I would have stomach cramps and diarrhea for a couple of days
Who got hungry after watching this video
I ate a 4x4 today. 🙂
I feel bad for the bathroom
After finishing they immediately sat on the toilet and it looked the same way coming out as it did on the plate
You literally milked the cow, then butchered it. And who tf eats with gloves?
That is impressive! She rocked! And cool fact that the mangers would get trained at their own university for InNout
Did yall rrally think they was gonna eat all that??
So there's new openings at BuzzFeed?
Just watching this made me put on 5 pounds
Glad to see gluttony is still alive and well in America
They'd be such a cute couple - just saying 😄😄😄
I get it, diversity, but the ratio of whites to blacks to asians is not reflective of what's shown on buzzfeed. Not that's it's bad to have diversity in a cast, but it almost seems like diversity is a priority, which isn't what good recruiting consists of. Diversity should be something that happens naturally without it being a check box on a list. It just doesn't make sense to me, how their could be so many asians, specifically, concentrated into buzzfeed without diversity being a reason why they got hired. I dunno just a thought, please don't destroy me.
people who have never tried in-n-out have never lived, that is the only fast good i live by.
Matt Stonie and a small child could do this
Homeless people could have eaten these burgers cause we know you just barf them up afterwoods
Because of videos like this one, you can’t work at buzzfeed and be healthy
It’s not a challenge if you order it and don’t eat it all
EVAN IS FIRE AND SHES BEAUTIFUL AND THERE PERSONALITIES SEEM SO SIMILAR!! THEY WOULD MAKE SUCH A GREAT COUPLE
I eat Only 3..... But I'm Fat...... Evan, #RipEvan'sAbs
Are they sleeping while talking??
I would not order all that cheese !!
YB can really throw down. Also, her husky is #goallls they are such a beautiful breed i die whenever i see one
Wanna make extra money?? Click the following link and sign up. Happy Money Making!! 😊 \n\nhttp://formoneyonly.com/?refer=152669
Can't wait to go back home to have some In-N-Out!!!
I'd like to see YB do a Worth It cameo. Maybe for their next buffet episode
I hope some kids from Africa are watching this becau.. oh wait..
She is so cute
Blessings! please share my gofundme. no greed. just want to offer my full potential.\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/Homeforwinter
I'm sure this publicity stunt will backfire. Now, every time I see in-N-out, I feel like vomiting.
In my honest opinion maybe I can eat 8 patties or 9.... Anything more then 10 ima 😷😨
Being a vegan and watching this is so sad. The animals );
That is a heart attack on a table
*how to commit sucide in the best way possible
There we go, YB secret for eating load of junk food, but still have lean body. Just get a Husky =)))
Can YB be in every other video please?!?!
YB is the Korean Gal Gadot.
This is disgusting
Girl can eat damn
https://youtu.be/6iRka8Q0kvI

Noah is so ugly it's offputting
I'm not gay but I would let cole sprouse spread my ass checks open and fuck the shit out of me
i would let the redhead give me aids
I love how Lili and Cole and Riverdale in general kept making small little comments that were literally so fucking funny but no one laughed because their humour is really dry and witty and intelligent I'm living for it
Kj is  your other bae Ex! Miley sister And mom also Miley is my siblings ha yeah!
How long has it been since Miley Cyrus and Cole Sprouse were in the same room? Takes me back to the crossover between Suite Life and Hannah Montana.
The reunion of two OG Disney stars
Can you milk an almond?
He should of putt miley and cole qgainst each other because they were both on disney
“Are you speaking from experience?”
Suite Life of Zack and Cody vs. Hannah Montana Feud!!!!
Wish Camilla and madelaine got a chance to play
why are people afraid of you cole? cause youre a fucking abuser.
I wonder if that’s the first time cole and Miley got together since that’s so suit life of Hannah Montana 🙃
Noah and Cole could lowkey make a cute couple😂
She should have went against Cole to make it a old disney feud!
cody martin and miley Stewart together again
Are we not going to talk about how two of my favorite childhood actors ARE PLAYING AGAINST EACH OTHER??
LMAO @ Miley.....We from the South, we milk everything!!.....
I knew that spiders would be on the board
I really want to know what the forth option was!!! For some reason I felt like it was going to say commitment
I just remembered Cole and Miley worked together on Suite Life of Zack and Cody
I wish it was more than 10 mins!
I don’t like how they only get 2 “no results”
Lili at 0:42 I've got this shit down man
Is just me but cole's cute quirky self is trying so hard to make people laugh and they aren't laughing. #sorelatable
HANNAH MONTANA?\nZACK AND CODY?\n\nITS A DISNEY CHANNEL REUNION!
I love this so much
It's like a disney channel games thingee bc of miley and cole 😆
Can you milk a lizard
I'm not a shipper or whatever you call it but did you see that arm rub Lilli gave Cole 😲
You cannot tell me that this mini Disney  reunion did not make you happy:)
Cole looks great with dark heart or light hair ☺️💕
i love cole so much
RIVERDALE cast sounds so different on the show
cole kills me oml i love him
Fifth harmony 😎😉 😆😋 bring them back are the best FIFTH HARMONY 😎😑😆😎😑
We're southern, we milk everything there 😂
why is Cole being so pretentious
I wonder if COMMITMENT was the last choice on the Why are people afraid of.. question 🤔. Makes sense. I wish they showed it.
I'm all for this
Miley Cyrus looks severely autistic
Why does Noah act so damn weird. Lol
Man instead of Woman wtf
IS THAT COLE SPROUSE?!
two disney stars
Cole Sprouse is so freaking hot.
Noah and cole were twinning awww
Cole sprouse is my dad

SO EXCITED FOR RIVERDALE SEASON 2 AHH
HANNAH MONTANA AND CODY MARTIN

CODY MARTIN AND HANNAH MONTANA
Yo
Cole's face 5:51 😩
5:54 BUGHEAD❤❤❤
Cole is so goddamn funny
We're all southern. We milk everything there lol
Cole with the hover hand on Cami at 5:51 😂
Omg, Lily is so damn Daddy, love her
4:30 it's a little convenient that the house keeps winning oh my god Cole you slay my life 😂😂
This is the only thing that needs to be said: Cole. Fucking. Sprouse.
I feel bad for Miley. She's doing the MOST to sell her new album and it's only going to sell 30,000 to 40,000 copies. Bangerz sold almost 300,000 copies it's firsr week. Shes so talented and genuine. She deserves more success.
*I like how Cole and Noah’s outfits are in sync and they both have the dyed black hair thing going❤️*\n6:30
Why did it take so long to guess ears or bellybutton lmao
Tee hee hee, I was thinking can you milk a human. That's the real question.
DISNEY CHANNEL VIBES! COLE SPOUSE AND MILEY CYRUSSS <3
Miley is Smart
How pretty is Lili Reinhart?
How did you do in the test? Leave a comment!\n\nCouple weeks left to get this round of merch:\nhttp://merch.andrewhuang.com\n\nGIVEAWAY WINNERS!\nMoritz Mader\nPeter Choi\nLinus Würfel\nFélix Vandeneycken\nRida Shahdad\nJune Pilote\n\nFollow me here to catch the next giveaway:\nhttp://twitter.com/andrewhuang\nhttp://instagram.com/andrewismusic\nhttp://facebook.com/andrewismusic\n\nThanks for watching :)
Save yourself alot of agony and skip to 1:34
It could be an electric guitar...
That was surprisingly easy to me. I imagine it be a lot more difficult if you started getting into similar instruments, like a harp, piano, guitar, cello, violin, and banjo.
So... that wasn't difficult. Fun watch though!
tbh got them all right but i also got to see the people say what they thought
So I went to an arts school and i played tormbone, viola, guitar ( we did both acoustic and electric but mostly acoustic until performance time), piano and voice and thank god i got 100% bc it'd be embarrassing if I didn't
Hey Andrew tell your racist friend how you feel when he mocks Asians with slanted eyes gesture.
Nice I got all of them right! Do I win a thing?
What the heck? I got these all right, but thought it was very easy to guess them o:
Is this guy gay?
They all sound like drums.
I got them all right!
You should do a real or digital intrument/orchestra test
I got 'em all!  But I had to wait to hear the cello before I was sure the previous one was electric guitar.  I played trumpet for 8 years, so I most definitely knew that sound.
Ugh i switched the piano and nylon guitar but 4/6 for me yay
WHO THE F*CK IS THIS GUY !!!!!!!!!?
Clarinet\nElectric\nNylon (Funny, because I said trumpet, but switched it....)\nTrumpet\nPiano\nCello
I GOT THEM ALL RIGHT
I was 100% right! I have no background in music so I'm proud. How many sounds were presented in the original class mentioned?
Oddly got em right even though guessed at half.... but have studied music since 4th grade
I'm very surprised that I got all of them right...
You call that a test? Pssht, more like a breeze.
Did you just call a trumpet a wind instrument
Pretty sure I guessed electric guitar for 4 of them..
watching cause I saw the guy who did Idubbbz distrack in the thumbnail.
it could be an electric guitar if you banged it against my thick skull enough times
What happened to the It could be an electric guitar if MEMES!??
It's the guy who made you know what \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVOLDEMORT\n\nEdit: he made PFUDOR
I wonder if Andew had the multiple choice when he took the test as a student... I got them all in this test, but I never would have if I didn't have the multiple choice. So, Andrew, if you aced the test without the answers, freakin kudos, man.
Good 👍watch  a  video on my channel CJ Collins
Its not very hard.. i thought it would be
You should get real samples next time! A few of these are giveaways solely because the way created sounds trying to emulate realistic sounds has been done pretty much the same way for a very long time. I would be interested with the actual instruments' sound.
half the comments saying it's idubbs ghost writer!\nspelled like that, ya.
Very little musical training, still scored 100%
100%. was super easy for me dunno why
I mean, that electric guitar sounded like a trumpet. I hesitated to change but decided not to. But I probably should have cause I inverted the two.\nBut I pretty much got them all right.
I got all of them right, probably because I play half of these instruments already \n\n\nNo one cares lol
sweet, i totally nailed it.. the 2nd to last one I was iffy on until I heard the final one
I got them all correct, which surprised me because I’m not a professional musician and I’m terrible with pitch. I guess tone uses a different part of the brain. However I don’t believe I could recognise the instruments at all without having the list first.
I got all of them BE PROUD OF ME
Are you an alien? No hate
I GOT THEM ALL RIGHT
Huh. I got them all right.
That first one could be an electric guitar if you made the neck a large tube that went through the body and blew through it instead of using the strings
That would be a great meme however we need a suitable picture and then we can create the format.
YES!! Another last name twin!
I got zero right! \nEveryone, please watch my little nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
I'm not a musician not I play an instrument yet I got them all right... Luck?
This was easy c’mon.
1. Clarinet\n2. Nylon guitar\n3. Electric guitar\n4. Piano\n5. Cello\n6. Trumpet because it's all I have left 😂😂\nYay I got 3 right!
clarinet\nelectric guitar\nnylon guitar\npiano\ncello\ntrumpet\n\n\nI did pretty well actually. I realized after I heard the last sound that the last one was definitely a nylon guitar and that I had mixed up nylon guitar with trumpet. I decided not to change my answers, though, because I didn't want to feel like I was cheating and I had guessed all my answers before hearing Rob, Dave, or Roomy's commentary so I didn't want to change that feeling.
I thought I knew musical instruments but apparently i don't even know what a nylon guitar is so
Got them all right am i human
6 out of 6 I am only an amateur (bedroom) guitarist, playing for more than 10 years now, but I have a good ear for recognising melodies, songs and sounds. \nNever studied notes and I am only playing by ear or tabs  whatever song or melody I like.  :) Very nice test!
0:05 and its selling like a god church
I got them all right but only with help from Rob. XD  I did know the trumpet immediately though cuz I’ve played the trumpet since I was 9 which was 10 years ago. Would’ve loved to do it without knowing what Rob Dave and Joel said though
This dude needs to stop for a breath or something
All of them are eletric guitars
I love that all my favorite creators are trending! Been here since the beginning, you guys deserve it ❤️
Is this the new Fine Bros React?
That was easy af. 100%
Its called attack and decay people
I got 6/6, but I'm not as good as Andrew.\n\n#humblebrag
I got them all correct and I don’t even play an instrument..
I got all of them right!!! I’d say it may be from 7 years of grade school orchestra class but everyone in the video is a trained musician, right?
Of course Rob got them all right, he plays every instrument known to man.
I got them all right! Definitely took process of elimination at the end. Fun challenge
when you see dat guy who sang why i don't go to school song, *click*
6/6! I didn't expect that.
Got em all. Though the cello made me hesitate.
I got them all right! :D
Nailed it!
6 for 6 baby
Stupid noise !! 😕😖
All 6!
YES i got them nyahahahah
Yeasssssss got 'em all
Perfect score squad wya?
100%
Congrats on trending 👌 👌 👌

Next time do not swear or cuss
No offense but did you get, like, plastic surgery on your eyes?
his eyebrows look like they belong to a jack-o-lantern.
I lost it at the Gemma Collins part. 😂
Bloody ell I was crying at the Gemma Collins bit enough on snapchat 😂 My boyfriend is currently wondering wtf I'm finding so funny 😂

The Aquarium looked like a date 😉😆. Poppy is hot! Best wishes gabs x (im probs misreading shit but ah well)
Omg one time I literally pushed my laptop off the table because there was a spider on the screen
I really hope this doesn't come across as patronising because I really don't mean it to but can I just say how fucking amazing it is to see you out the flat so much recently and especially getting out to see friends. As someone who suffers from anxiety and depression I know how hard it is to even leave the house, I struggle to even take my daughter to nursery most days without feeling sick at the thought. I'm proud of you for even your little trips to the beach to read or sit and think. Hope your doing well babes, you really seem to be getting there with things and I know it doesn't mean you are but I hope you are. Love you loads xxxx
I feel like there is sexual tension between poppy and gabbs ahaha
Love the editing is this vlog💜

Thought  your new gold cabinet was suppose to come in September?
Gabby and Poppy Are So Fucking Cute GOALS 🙌🏽Secretly already shipping them 😆
Poppy is like so fuckin hot
Can i just point out how on point the background music has been over the last few years? I don't know why I'm just now noticing how well it meshes with the flow of each video, but good on you lads, and by lads I probably mean Mike unless he's delegated music duties away at some point.
I need this in and around my mouth.
It looks amazing but I don't want to think of how many calories is in a ice cream scoop of nut butter lol
The amount of puns in the comments today is Nuts
Almond butter, oats, maple syrup, blueberries and coconut oil.. My almost everyday breakfast. Btw, I process the almonds more for thinner consistency. Peanuts doesn’t take much processing as compare to almonds. Good job guys you never fail to make the food better. 👌
“This is how the Scots make it.” Aye Ben, those of us with no tastebuds. Most use full fat Scottish milk. Ta for the salt though.
No sprig of mint!?!?
Can I have a bit?
That wiggly head movement before Ben says Sorted!
Nice work there!!! But always wonder if you guys always eat as FANCY as you guys always do on SORTED KITCHEN! So comes the idea of taking footage of what you guys eat regularly in your everyday life. can be a self-taken or randomly visited by a fellow sorted member-taken footage. Want to see at least a small portion of what you cook and eat everyday!! Keep up the good work!!
@SORTEDfood could I make sunflower butter the same way you guys have made it?
Nut butter something you can whip up in just about 10 mins ;)
My only issue is that looks to be about 1,000 calories worth of almond butter lol
But can this be made on a windy night in Stoke?
Love it, but damn. Those calories in one whole ice cream scoop of almond butter.
Never thought to put almond butter on my oatmeal
How long would it last for in a jar? does it need to be stored in a fridge?
Guys....as much as I love nut butters, that's a lot for a single serving. Yes it's high in protein, yes it's a good source of fiber, yes its a good source  of healthy fats, but IT'S STILL FAT GUYS. 1 tablespoon (recommended serving) is 16g of fat! (Which to put it into perspective, recommended fat intake on a 2000 calorie diet is approx 44-78 g)
I always cook oatmeal/porridge with water. 😀😀😀
Barry with the everchanging hair
@sortedfood Can you make different dishes that is made out of edible flowers, pretty please.
I use honey over maple syrup because you get the pollen from the local flowers that helps your body fight allergies and it tastes awesome.
Challenge, gentlemen: for one of the ultimate battles, set a price limit and make the boys buy aaaaaalll their own ingredients - including spices, oils, herbs and all the other staples that kitchens normally already have. (Mostly I just think it'd be funny because you *know* they'll forget something.)
I haven't counted but this product has been out of stock for months! Every one of these made better videos gets me in the mood to buy a new food processor but then I can't follow the link to purchase it :(
I love your videos, keep them coming.  You should have yiur own show !  You have fantastic music playing in the background.  Where do you get it from?
I am definitely going to try this!! ❤❤❤ .. Thanks Boys
Makes me wish I wasn't allergic to almond s
Why do I feel this is James's recipe or the porridge is at least
Barry's hair looks like chocolate butter cream
this is how you up your butter game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQuWF6l1Zkw (Chefsteps pistachio butter)
Is there a way to make waffles without a waffle machine?
Roasting the oats before making the porridge brings out some wonderfull flavors. Roasting aka baking it quickly in a dry pan before adding your liquid
How much?\nAn awful lot.
Could y'all do some recipe for canning? I love to can and a creative recipe would be greay
I don't understand why y'all didn't say it has healthy fats. That's literally the most significant attribute of nuts
Not as good as the Kellogg's videos.
Woohoo Scottish porridge 😊 I make it every day with water, dash of milk and salt. Also I make it far thicker just like my Gran taught me. Pour cold milk on the hot porridge in your bowl and it's even better. Yum!
I use this near exact recipe for almond butter myself but I blend intermittently. Yes it is a little bit of a hassle stopping-and-starting the blender (but this helps to avoid overheating if your blender is older/cheaper etc) but, taking the time between blends to move the nut butter manually (as it will start to stick to the sides and remain thick) helps to give you a gorgeous smooth and glossy butter which can be spooned with ease into a jar or container of your choice!
Gotta love Barry's t-shirt. \nI have sold many of those (the brand Henri Lloyd). \n\nBrownie point to Barry! :D
And I thought that was chocolate ice-cream for breakfast! :P
What if you're allergic to almonds? 😂
Can you use any type of butter, like it definitely doesn’t h a v e to be almonds correct?
Slow release of oats 🤔 😂 think you mean 'energy' Ben?
Erm I always make porridge with water...doesn't burn as easily and I focus on adding yummy flavours to it once ready
I'm craving this now
Anyone cringe when he says sorted when he's finished cooking, my skin crawls
Who saw a while u were sleeping ad?
Hey there should be a battle where the winner gets a brownie point,but the loser gets brownie points deducted. Like maybe 1-2 brownie points depending on how close it was.
Breakfast isn't any more important than any other meal of the day...
They cut Ben off in the intro :(
I mean if you want to split hairs, by a lot of people’s argument that’s not porridge that’s gruel. Proper porridge is way better but man I have a soft spot for gruel. \nIt reminds me of camping and eating breakfast by the fire at some time around dawn, next to a forest in the fog and drizzle and rain, with unlaced walking boots and a waterproof that’s a bit damp inside and smells of wood smoke. Objectively a horrible situation to be in, but comforting all the same.
1:44 - what is going on with the audio?
Porridge for champions!
love this!!
looks good!
Tomorrow's breakfast - sorted!
Does Tyrone like almond butter Ben?
IT'S VEGAN!! THANKYOU I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS DAY
Looks absolutely delicious boys. So here's another one for the vegans and vegetarians! Personally, I'm a carnivore but I would certainly eat that! Another excellent recipe!! 😘😘
YASSSSSSS ON THE VEGAN RECIPE!! So much love and thanks for this! 🌱
well it's dinner time and all i want to eat is this.
There is a difference between chopped and slivered.  That dish looked good.
That looked marvelous, must give this a go. Almond is the only nut that I like.
i always add pomegranates in my oats! <3
hey ben say meow have you try the french quebecor from canada called poutine of any type like you can make chicken poutine and the regular poutine is made with french fries and cheese and barbacue sauce  and if you want you put any type of meat in it
It looks like ice cream
Porridge without milk? I'm sceptical but I trust you guys!
This looks delicious. As someone who always has oatmeal for breakfast this is something I'll definitely try. However, if you don't like nuts / almonds try mixing in blueberries when the oatmeal is cooking or simply eat it with almond milk and lingonberries. it's delicious.
Isn't that 'porridge' technically gruel as I am almost certain gruel is oats and water made in the same way porridge is? I'm not hating, I'm just saying.
I'd love to know the macros for this.
So could this be a substitute for peanut butter in your other recipes? I have a bad reaction to peanuts but tree nuts (including almonds) are fine ^^
Mike and Jamie are still in the bathroom since the last video
anyone know what the intro/background music is?
so... where's Ben's mint leave????
Heheh, Nut butter.   (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Banoodle
Comfort food for breakfast.
My mouth is watering!!! <3
BEN NO SPRIG! NO MINT BEN!!!
Delicious😍
love ya guys!
RIP Uncle Phil
Nutty morning glory 😏
Sorted food ❤❤❤❤💝💝💝
oh yummm
yum!!! that scoop of almond butter looks like chocolate icecream
91
🍨
I have to say, with all the ads we are bombarded by on a daily basis, you guys do sponsored videos the right way! No random product placement, just you guys teaming up with food related companies or using their machines to make otherwise normal recipes. It doesn't take anything away from the experience of watching you all and I am thankful & grateful for it.\n\nMuch love from Canada <3
Barry: Presentation is everything *places the almond butter off center *
You roast the almonds to bring out the oils to make it easier to blend. I definitely don't think you need to add maple syrup or coconut oil to the almonds, but that's just me.\n\nHere's a thought though, what other nut butters really work? Almond butter is already awesome and indulgent, so what would macadamia butter be like?
Great recipe lads. Is this considered part of Sauce Week? I can never really tell with the Kenwood videos lol
Yay vegan, tasty stuff! More, please =D
Is the fridgecam format over? what happened to the brownie points?
OMG I REMEMBER THIS FUCKING CHANNEL! USED TO WATCH THESE GUYS BUT I DID NOT HAVE A YOUTUBE ACCOUNT TO SUBSCRIBE AT THE TIME (Back in the days) BUT NOW I HAVE AND HAVE BEEN FOR AWHILE SO WELL SUBCRIBED I AM
Hey guys! I'm interested in making this I was just wondering how long it will keep once it's been made and stored
Ten minutes?!?! My porrige takes like thirty seconds....
holy crap that's a big scoop of nut butter!! :o
I've never heard of boiling your oats in milk! I've always had it with water
It would be nice if you had the names of the dish on the screen to help us who are not fluent, so we know what to look for or order.
how do i go here so often and i never saw you T_T i even went to 2 of the places you've been T_T
the background music is distracting
So glad to hear you're in L.A, because now I can finally try out some places that you visit! :) Keep up the awesome work Mike, love your videos
whats with the vancouver shirts ahha love it!
OMG I WAS JUST THERE LIKE A FEW DAYS AGO
Good thing I live in the 626, I can go to those places if I want some of those fancy noodles :)
Is that Rowland Heights?
Dude. Hit me up next time your in LA. I'll take you to some other Xian restaurants.
Cindy's place is my all time fav❤️ their lamb skewers r also very good！！！
ShanXI cuisine is very tasty because the combination of meat noodle and spicy, I love them so much.
Seems like location 1 was the best out of the 3.
Must be crazy getting customers who order gluten-free.
I have two questions: 1.) Is Mike REALLY eating at all three restaurants on one single day? 2.) Does he finish eating all dishes?
holy crap, you're in la san gabriel right now?!
hot oil is life
NOT all on the one day ? surely?
What? you were in San Gabriel valley?
Anyways your love for food is addicting and beautiful
Dam is 1 am and I’m watching FOOD 🥘 , What am I doing
I love ur videos but y not try something like a different ethnicity :)  greek,italian, or Ecuadorian. (My country ) :) enjoyyy Nd keep up the good work
There are def homemade tastes that go back to childhood and you'll remember them forever. For me it's my g-gma's chicken and dumplins. We have the recipe but its written in old school recipe format (2 handfuls of this, pinch of this, mix till it looks right). We've been trying to replicate it for years.
I always pass that place every time but I never considered checking it out until now!
GO TO HK CAFE IN SG ITS BOMB

Dude, how long do you work out for?
how many pork burgers are you going to have lol
What's up with the background music it sounds really strange
That's my neck of the woods! I've been to the first place and it's legit awesome! 👍altho they usually run out of liang pi by dinner time on weekends =(
Where are those Noods, I need them NOW!!!!!
need to go try the china town in houston, tx pretty big there they own like the streets banks etc.
I'm so trying these out!! I'm glad I live in LA
Man good video I'm go to those spots this weekend, maybe not the 3rd place
I stayed in Xi’an for 6 weeks a few years back and have craved the food so much ever since I left. This video got my mouth watering and brought back so many memories. Thank you! I hope to enjoy Xi’an cuisine again some day
Nice to see Mike trending a lot you deserve it no gimmicks just Mike and food
He had a ratatuille food critic flashback from a bite of that starchy meatball soup
WHAT?!?!? I NEVER KNEW MIKE CHAN HAD A THIRD CHANNEL!!!\nAND NICE JOB GETTING #16 ON TRENDING!!\nI love watching your science videos (beyond science)
damn i was gonna flame when you picked up the white pepper by saying it was salt, but then you ended up schooling me a sec later!  Keep up the great work dumpling man :).
hi Mike I wanted to let you know that I really enjoy your videos. Watching your videos makes me go to sleep hungry.
Xi'an cuisine, fundamentally, seems like a hybrid of Sichuan and Cantonese with a touch of middle eastern influence.
Thank you for coming to the 626😍😍😍
slop with dead bodies for a a guy whose only interest is his appetite and who has no awareness of animal suffering that I am sorry if
If you like the texture of the xi'an pork bun, you must find and try Venezuelan Arepas. It is similar but made with corn flour. They also stuff protein into it or use it a side of soups.
OMG I HAVE BEEN THERE
I waited all day to watch this at night so I can torture myself
You can eat a lot for a little dude
Haha, same shirt as the Tokyo video, nice!
Well my mouth is watering...
Whaaaaat?? I would have totally drove to LA for you
Dammit! I waited too long and Cindy's is closing.....😢
I caught myself blowing on the hot steamy soup on the screen...  🤷🏽‍♂️    🍲
In Los Angeles?? This is nowhere near Los Angeles. You,re in the valley and about 35 minutes from LA by freeway........with no traffic. The huge San Gabriel Valley covers at leat 10 cities, so why not just mention the city you are actually in. My guess is the city of Alhambra.
Wahhhhhh....you were actually in my neighborhood! I've been to some of those locations! Been watching you for a couple years now. I can't believe you were in town! :O cool!
You eat so much food yet stay so small and not fat. It pisses me off...
Is it just me or does this guy have multiple channels. Could have sworn I was already subbed to him
I’ve been watching his videos for about 5 months now, but I still don’t get what gluten is... Can someone please explain me?👏🏽
Did he say his leg lifting up he's a girl.....
This guy can eat!
Happy wife, happy life? More like Good food, good mood.
Can't have the soup. I'm allergic to lamb😢
I’ve been craving soup dumplings and the noodles that have all the sauce in the bottom and you have to mix it up \nI’m in the la area aswell \nWhat do you recommend
Please tell me you wore the same shirt for continuity purposes and not because you ate all that on the same day......I like to watch you while I eat and i was already holding on my stomach by the beginning of the second restaurant XD
U can eat bro wow !! How do u do it lol looks yummy tho
Hey Mike, I love when you speak your native language. Thanks for sharing ❤
I’m surprised you didn’t make a video eating moon cakes
626 area is where the good food is at!
Oh man when you leaned into the camera for that crunch, I had a eargasum
those  pork burger do look nice... oh here a bit of food new from china the CPC has just banned soft cheeses i few people i know are very upset about it.
Love the Married with Children reference!
This makes me hungry! Damn it!

有没有想过去bilibili投稿呀！看的太有食欲了！！
I cut this out of the episode, but I'm seeing this question show up in the comments, so let me clarify:\n\n- The clock in the garage is ALWAYS stuck at that time in every scene you see it, at least in this episode. So the time it reads can't be used as a part of putting together an accurate timeline of events. Good job looking out for it, though!
If they teleported they would have gone home instantly, meaning if they started right away the clone could be done by 5 or six meaning that it could still be broad day light and the real Beth would have enough time to change places whit the clone of herself to leave while the clone becomes consiense and act like a normal Beth.
Although I agree that the Beth at the end of the episode was the real Beth, you didn't take into account that they could've been in the process of creating a clone of Beth at the same time that they were making a clone of Tommy. (Wait, when was it that Beth had the existential crisis?). Or alternatively, Rick may have already had a clone of Beth ready just in case something like this were to happen.\n\nAnd were you hinting that the next theory was gonna be of the Emoji Movie? (Seriously, who thought that would make for a movie premise?)
Couldn't Rick at the end have just gone to a universe where the pizza place is open till midnight?
It is a CLONE!
If this episode was set over the weekend then why were Morty and Summer in school and Jerry had to drag them out of it to save them from his alien ex girlfriend. Was it an oversight from the writers?
I'm going to say Beth is a clone. I don't expect it to be revealed through any logic either. I expect Rick to explain something was faked or the clock was broken or something to just rub it in. \n\nAlso, Rick can stop time. STOP time.
Hey matpat! So I've been wondering why pretty much all of the the frame by frame episodes are gone. I haven't seen any answers anywhere and I'm fairly sure I'm not the only viewer who's wondering what happened. If you could answer that would be great! Thank you very much!
But they took Tommy to his house, not the penitentiary...
What if they used the portal gun with the car after they dropped the guy
Your theory heavily relies on them driving back because they walked through the door? What if they took a taxi and then portal gunned back to the front door?
Does the clock on the wall when Rick is making the offer not say 2pm? And even so if we take the 4 hour drive thing and go with it in the scenario Beth in ep 10 is a clone would just mean the clone was still in the process of being made at the end of ep 9.
I don't think it matters honestly. Its ambiguous for a reason.
Look at the time on the clock at 4:27
the last part of of the episode happens on a monday. Because Jerry pulls the kids out of school, i don't feel you got this one right.
Dose it matter \nIf it's a clone then it makes no difference who's what anyway family\nGuy is better anyhow
What if they went to the custody weekend on Friday. Because many people would refer to Friday afternoon as part of the weekend, and that way it could be all day
She's not a clone, she's healthy Beth, Rick has toxic Beth locked away or exploring the cosmos
Film Theorists I got to say that I really like watching you videos but I just can’t stop myself form bring this thing to your attention.\n\nYour time line just dose not work. So what if they show clocks all over what really matters is the B story (that is the true time line). First its Saturday morning the start of their Fathers weekend. They go to his home (in the bubbles) and have dinner with his new girl friend. The next time we see them they have been hunting all Sunday and are tired wanting to go home. When we see them again Daddy has driven them home (at night in the rain) and that would make it Sunday night. Next we see them getting pulled out of school so they can run form new girlfriend. That would make it Monday and when they get home after the hunting girlfriend thing its later in the day and dinner time with mom. \n\nI am not saying your theory is wrong but your time line just dose not add up to me. Why are they at school? Why would they be at school on a Sunday? Maybe the writers just put in clocks all over to make people look at that to though you off or maybe that just how the world works, I mean a lot of people have clocks telling us time.
+The Film Theorists You NEEEEEED to cover a theory on what the hormone monsters from Netflix's new series Big Mouth because it's really popular right now and the show is a really funny genuinely sex positive and gender equality focussed. The hormone monsters are monsters that kids can see when they start going through puberty and they seem to be real creatures that kick started human evolution \n\n*edit* the hormone monster controls when people get horny and procreate and he says in episode 10 that hes 75 million years old. Maybe a theory on his origins?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK_kxRPx2nI&t=3s watch the real issue
MatPat you're REALly awesome ^^ Thanks for all these videos!
maybe the 3 hours to do the cloning were to build the machines and not the process itself, because as we see it did not take so long for the clone to grow old
Here's what I Wanna know...Just HOW strong is Sailor Moon and just what EXACTLY is she capable of? (In terms of 'science')
Y the fuck would rick drive 4 hours when he can teleport instantaneously?
They could've driven through a portal to avoid the long drive home, no?
You do realise that you actually only needed about 10 seconds of video to say (what would have solved all this shit with no complication at all):\n\nIn the last episode of this season, Beth asks Rick if she's the clone. Since Rick only offered the 'clone deal' to the real Beth, that Beth asking Rick must be the original Beth.\n\nTHEEND
This theory is flawed, I mean the significance of time. Jerry barges into to pick Morty at school in Goldenfold's class. \nNow for the clone thing, Rick said I love you to Beth as a form of goodbye. She went full Rick there's no coming back from that.

I say clone. You forgot the scene where they are at school. So the episode takes place after a matter of days, not just a weekend. I'm betting the end scene was on a Mon. or Tue. and Beth asked Rick to clone her. Hence why she loves her family, Gerry, and Rick. And is now happy, instead of an emotional wreck she's been this season.
what if the clone is being made while they're eating pizza, and then she swapped out that night?
Morty is a clone. Calling it
I don't wanna throw a wrench in this because I like the theory a lot, but could Justin have been fake news'-ing that tweet?  In Rest & Ricklaxation, Healthy Morty's girlfriend say's that Morty was from the Midwest and Morty said that was true.
The assumption that Rick does not already have a Beth clone ready to go in a plastic package should not be made.  I challenge the 3 hours needed to grow the clone as I'm pretty sure Rick has clone of all the family ready 'in case.'
MatPat, do a horror theory for October, like what the diet of a human centipede would have to be to viably support each person in the chain,  and how long the chain could theoretically go. It... came up in a discussion.
LOL.  There's no evidence that they drove back.  Just because they walked in the front door means nothing.  They could have teleported to the front yard.  Duh...
Rick could've used an alternate clone. He said flip a switch to terminate it. Also, in the next episode, Rick sort of panics when Beth asks him, and reluctantly responds, so I assumed she was a clone
Hey my theorist cult leader I have a request and I may very be the only one that thinks this is any good of an idea but I have one. Gantz, my favorite goriest and messed up anime. My idea is for you to see how realistic the view on life is as the gods can create life easily with information being that all our souls are is information. Its a great show if you like messed up things and it overall is one of my favorites
They carried clone tommy to his residence. They didn't directly take him to the execution chamber. Morty and summer could've returned the next day.
Hey what about the part where Jerry pick summer and morty from school idk about you but school on Sunday is not a thing.
It doesn't matter
Couldn't Rick already have a clone of Beth ready? I mean, he had a few clones of himself ready in the lil' Rick episode...
Hey! matpat pointing you out is me! You forgot about this very important detail its not that it's to late it's that it's SUNDAY! Think about it! Sunday is when most places are closed because of church! so Beth could still be cloned!
SHE is A CLONE, watch ep 10 season 3
Film theorists! Please create a theory about rwby!
I would subscribe if you could promise to stop showing your ridiculously stupid, unbelievably punchable face in all impending videos.
Actually I was thinking it's possible that the Beth we've seen throughout the show is a clone to begin with. As in, the original Beth ditched a long time ago, and Beth clone also eventually considers leaving her family. Rick gives her the same option as the original Beth, but Beth clone decided not to leave. (Or maybe Rick seemingly gave her the choice, but it's possible that the clone is made so that she is incapable of deciding to leave, and therefore has no free will).
What if rick already had a clone ready? I wouldn't be surprised honestly
BACK TO REALITY \nOPP THERE GOES GRAVITY
Real since in ep 10 RIck says she is real but I'm up for clone too because that would be awesome!
I have a neighbor named Rick and he has a daughter named Martha. RICK AND MARTHA!!!
What if the clone was already made by Rick before the offer was given??!!?? I mean, why would Rick suddenly allow his daughter... someone with no experience of inter-dimensional travel, the offer if he hasn't thought about beforehand. It's a big thing to risk his daughter though there are many realities of Beth.
gtfo, she's a clone
will he ever do doctor who
You have been proven right. Why Let clone beth remember the talk? It would only lead to trouble.
You could be right or the show writers said to hell with logic and threw those details in to keep us occupied until season four
I did not *belch* Clone my daughter
Rick could have already had a clone of Beth waiting.
Real beth lol and if last episode when Beth says he won't tell us if so his eyes don't move or anything because when he gets caught he runs off or face changes lol but loved the vid
So, here's the thing... Rick is smart... He's insanely smart... And as we saw in a previous episode he plans for eventualities in advance. (The Memory Mix-up Episode.) This entire theory falls apart when you look at the other side of the pizza. Yes... There was no time travel involved in getting the pizza.... But what if he had one laying around in advance? What if he already considered this might happen and had cloned Beth in before he even talked to her about it? He could have even revved up the cloner before they left to stop the execution. You remember how long it takes to go to and from? The fresh Beth clone would be ready before they got back. Then Rick pops the hypothetical and Beth either takes him up on it, or the Beth clone gets decomissioned. Zap!
Ok, so, I know you said they don't mess with time so I'm starting out with saying that that's not what I'm proposing. What I am proposing however is that what if only the pizza scene happened on a different day? Whose to say that cloning Beth didn't take that long and afterwards she went to bed to prepare for the start of her adventures the following day (Or maybe skip sleeping and just start adventuring) and then the next day have Rick test out the new clone with the kids and all we are seeing is the end of a long day of testing the clone ended by some nice family-time pizza! And also the whole the pizza joint is closed because it's a Sunday thing, what if Reynaldo's is a pizza place that closes a lot earlier, or they might, possibly maybe, give their employees Monday off.
Beth is real, if only because that's the least likely scenario. Everyone I've talked to is convinced she's a clone because jumping ship would have no consequences... except for that of Beth's conscience. Plus, accepting Rick's offer proves she's exactly like him, abandoning the family. Smart money is that Beth did the ethical thing and stayed..... but I wouldn't discount Rick making a clone anyway and letting the clone go off on their own adventures. Certainly something that would come up again in the future...
Unless Rick either already had a clone ready on hand, or began the process as they left with Tommy (the latter is doubtfull, since he seemed to need at least himself to be there through most of the process).
Do a pokemon, I chose you thoery
We have no evidence that Beth and Rick drove to the execution site and would have to drive back. Beth and Rick drop the Tommy clone off with his parents.
Hey Mat! Lizard person here!\n\nHey I doubt you're following Dragon Ball Super (the new stuff going on right now). There's a saga where there's a mind blowing timeloop going on (future trunks saga), and I think I'd be really cool to see your take on it. I doubt you'll make one using the Japanese version with subtitles, but in the future when it's dubbed or something, I think it's something interesting I could see you cover in here.
hey matpat can you do a theory on how many souls alucard, from hellsing ultimate, has inside him?
So what if he had started making the clone prior?
Im going off of someones comment but what if rick already has clones of everyone. He has clones of himself. Just an idea I could be completely wrong idk.
Shit I live in Washington state guess I’ll pay rick and Morty a visit
i got a theroy that rick and morty are still in a simulation or something that backs it up first of all if rick knows we are watching him he maybe thinks that we are aliens  if he keeps us entertained we send in some deadly gas in his simulation  we are watching him do everything he dose EVEN IN THE PILOT EPISODE think about it if he escaped  than there would be no more wierd things on earth  also in mortys mind blows has nothing to do with it but this one green crystal in some backgrounds that nobody mentions what do they mean maybe he never had evil morty just normal morty since he never made it when evil morty is around its possible he erased starting endings i mean if somebody has a idea of what those green memory blowers might be it just might be danger or the return of the crystals rick throws out in season 1 or 2 what if it means well this is crazy but maybe memorys of pickle morty  green with green kinda makes sense right ?
Jerry pulls Morty and Summer out of school midway through the episode. If this was all happening on the weekend before the execution why were they in school on a sunday? this seems like a much bigger oversight than simply setting sunset 1/2 hour later than possible.
Well what if they went on a Friday afternoon right so that's mean they could've done it on Sunday but another question pop up tho didn't jerry picked Morty at school and one last thing maybe the affectionate beth and rick might be her goodbyes the last meal she's going to have with her family
Clone it’s more fun that way:) love you matpat!

If she was a clone why wouldn't Rick just erase that conversation from her memory of that conversation it would solve the problem of the clone finding out she was a clone because that was a private conversation between just her and Rick and he's the smartest guy in the multiverse and he's lazy and not a stranger to erasing minds so to save himself the problem I would definitely see if he did clone her he would do it then make the clone with all the memories except the last few hours just to keep the clone story working for a long period of time but he didn't  but if he did she wouldn't even have the suspicion of being a clone because it would be all she knows unless Rick specifically tells her since he would be the only one who knows she would be a clone so even without the clocks she's definitely not a clone
Can this channel just please just die.
A lot of people seems pretty triggered by this video, even though it's made by (and I quote from CinemaSins themselves) a bunch of soulless assholes who do not consider themselves as movie reviewers or film critics \nI get that this has a lot of mistakes within it, but you don't need to fanboy/fangirl and write a 10 page essay on why they suck\nSeriously, chill
Do Everything Wrong With Baby Driver
Deckart is obviously a Gen 7 being tested by hunting Gen 6's.. duh
Say: Turn the page and thousands die. :)
Do everything wrong with the mummy (2017)
Hey dickhead, the fish place doesn't sell fish as food like some sort of fucking fish and chips store it's a Fish as a pet store where they build fake fish so people can keep them as status symbols. Kind of the perfect place to take a scale you found in a tub which you suspect is engineered. That whole market is dedicated to a huge animal fetish in the blade runner world. The ostriches being herded through and the snake store being right down the block should have been a clue. Now I know it doesn't show 60 seconds of him driving there but that doesn't mean it's right by his apartment. You guys are literally the people who needed the voice over to understand the movie.
You missed a sin: there's a big neon Atari sign in a transition shot near the part with Leon's apartment. Atari is now so low on the games industry hierarchy that they're not even fit to wipe Miyamoto's ass for him, much less have neon street signs.
How dare you! There is nothing wrong with Bladerunner, especially the photo zoom thing that doesn't seem physically possible.
Yes most of the companies that had product placement in this movie took major hits or completely shut down within a decade of this movie.  The so called curse.  \n\nThe movie starts in November 2019.  Roy's expiration date is 1/8/2020.  So the film obviously covers that time period without notating it.  \nAlso, they wanted to base the film in 2020 but decided against it because of the common verbiage of 20:20 vision.\n\nYou guys have access to google right?
I liked this more than the actual movie lol. LMAO at the Jedi Temple music :-D .
Every thing with the emoji movie
This movie really inspired Ghost In A Shell and maybe Minority Report
Am I the only person who likes to imagine that Blade Runner and Total Recall exist in the same universe?
3:48 but doesn't cinemasins already know that the owl is an android?
Sooooo deckert's a replicant?!😱\n\nAdmittedly, I've only watched this entire movie once as a child on network tv & it was of course cut-up-AF!! Liked it, never knew the big whoop, but was that the big whoop? He's the real experiment??
Another sin is that 2019 will have a new trend like fidget spinner not a flying cars. We are in 2017 dammit.
Look, I agree with much of what ya said. But it's film noir dudes!! You're gonna get certain things in every noir: drinking,\ndark interiors,\nrain,\nbrooding detective or detective-like folks, \nlong stretches of time devoted to building a sense of atmosphere...\nCalling them sins is like sinning horses and gun fights in a saloon in a western movie!\n\nStill, love the vid and you are so right about the gunshot through the table in the beginning! Why didnt anyone come?? And the gun looks way too small to have punched a hole the size of the one that appeared. AND bullets don't blow you back through a wall like that at all - thank you mythbusters!
Why is there less time for Flatliners...
It's been mentioned by a few others here but it bears repeating: Leon does not kill Holden. This is made clear in all cuts of the movie and I'm not even referring to the deleted scene in the hospital where Deckard speaks to Holden. CinemaSins didn't notice this because they were too busy coming up with snarky quips to actually pay attention to the movie. Blade Runner is beautiful and fascinating, but it isn't perfect (in any of its incarnations). I was looking forward to hearing what CS had to say, but a lot of the supposed sins they cobbled together are just lazy and merely pander to their easily bored/offended/confused middlebrow millennial audience. DING!
To clarify the scene at 9:00. That isn't a seafood stand. In this world most animals are extinct, meaning that most of the animals you see in the movie (and all of them in this scene) are synthetically made like the replicants. That's why Rickard asks if the owl in the one scene is real or not, because having real animals is very rare and is therefore a display of wealth. The vendors here sell synthetic animals and therefore can analyse their DNA.
I felt you were spot on with most of it but i still enjoy the movie.
Easily one of the most overrated movies of all time.
Can you do No Country for Old Men and There Will Be Blood? Two of the best movies of the 2000s and they came out in the same year.
You sould do one about the move IT
In the book this movie is based on 'Do androids dream of electric sheep?', there was a world war that killed millions of people and drove entire species into extention. That's why real animals were so expensive. I believe it says something about that in the beginning of the movie.
You were really clutching at straws with this one.  You just sounded annoying, like that guy at the movie theatre that read the book and won't shut up about how the movie missed it.
I thought he'd sin the rape scene
Um like why did you not sin the scene where Deckard was forcing himself on Rachel???
Would all you people dragging out that tired old line about how Deckard 'raped' Rachael kindly shut the fuck up, already? You've seen the movie, you know the context, you know what was going on in the scene and why he acted the way he did, she literally said, I want you; put your hands on me, blah, blah, blah. Let the meme die.
You sinned Blade Runner because your Grandmother likes Polaroids.  That's a sin.
you're a fucking idiot
That’s two videos in a row referencing Rick and Morty! These guys keep finding more ways to be freaking awesome! 👏🏽👏🏽
hard to enjoy this since we all frickin love Blade Runner....
17.38 min's you FUCKING CUNT'S LEARN TO COUNT.
Make an everything wrong with The Magic School Bus Rides Again.
Stupid how they complain about the scenes taking too long or having slow pacing. I know, it's 2017 and the ADHD generation can't keep their attention on a single shot for longer than 2 seconds... but still. These long shots of landscape and cityscape together with the music is literally what makes this movie great.\n\nI'm sure glad Denis Villeneuve didn't listen to these whiners when they made 2049.
I would have sinned the scene where Deckard kept Rachel from leaving and kept kissing her until she gave in....
Omg your harsh Blade Runner is a classic! LOL i wonder what you would do with Citizen Kane, actually i would love to see what you would do with Citizen Kane
Regarding the refinery plumes, there is an oil field in Los Angeles. Dunno about actual refineries though.
1:03 the gun was most likely strapped under the table -1 sin
Do everything wrong with it 2017
Fair enough, but I still love this movie.
Second comment, tacky, I know. So has anyone seen any of the 'original' shit this channel has produced? I get that they are being over dramatic and doing it for fun, sure. That's fine.\n\nBut it just bugs me when these guys are as uneducated as they are and insist on releasing books as well as other (more serious) media. \n\nShitty, unimaginative, and intellectually-thin boys who peaked in high school doing nothing more that shitting on things they couldn't create to begin with, \n\nMore people watch your everything wrong with videos to simply point out how many simple concepts you fail to understand, jokes you don't get, and irrelevant points you try to make because an object in the background scene reminds you of another movie you remember watching when you lost your virginity to you baseball coach for the 3rd time that day. \n\nStop taking yourself so seriously. Seriously.
Can you do Sleepy Hollow?\n\nAlso have a separate counter for each time somebody faints, and a counter for each time somebody is beheaded. Honestly these two might be more than the sins.\n\nSIN SUGGESTIONS BELOW\n\nWARNING: THE FOLLOWING TEXT CONTAINS SPOILERS\n(Duh)\n\n\n\nA few sin suggestions:\nIcabod leaves misleading notes out in plain slight like a complete idiot oh im sure no one will think anything of secret conspiracy, points to Baltus.\nKatrina never tells Icabod about the eye of protection and what it means yeah im just going to draw pentagrams under your bed without telling you what hey mean, and hope you wont notice.\n*Icabod getting stabbed* He survives this.\n*Icabod later getting shot* Luckily Icabod had Katrina's spellbook in his pocket so he could Teddy Roosevelt his way out of being shot.\n*Windmill exploding* Directed by Michael Bay\n*begining of movie* (christopher lee): A small town 2 days north of here (or something) known as... Sleepy Hollow. Roll credits.\n\nSorry for random order, just thought of some as I went.\nLove your channel, keep up the great work!
Dang. The nitpicking use to  be funny. That was just trolling.
Can someone tell me the name of the song at 16:55? POR FAVOR!!
Not sure why he wants to question such a huge repeating part of this universe the whole movie is telling you real animals have drastically declined in number to the point most people would be lucky to see one. This would also imply that meat could be sythetic product, why the fish merchant  has the ability to check the scale. Prices of animals already can enter the thousands even animals like snakes that are not sickly will cost you a couple hundred dollars and they're common still so it's not crazy to think they'd be expensive in this world.
Yo, i always sit here..... Enjoy your videos, like the videos....... But if you ever bag on White Zombies More Human Than Human again..... I'll whip your ass.
This is cinemasins' worst video yet.
...I wouldn't mind a new Brendan Frasier film...
Do Everything Wrong With Transformers The Last Knight
Wow. I’ve never seen so much people hurt about a video you shouldn’t really take so seriously. He wants you to get pissed with this one, but there’s actually a lot of good points he made about the movie. The plot is slow as hell, people just know shit willy-nilly, and it’s just... an OK movie. It’s not a pinnacle of the cyberpunk movie genre, there’s other movies that do that. I wouldn’t even consider this movie as a classic that much, either.
More like missing the point with Blade Runner. Conspicuous absence: The rape scene. Worst miss: Thinking the artificial animal market is a restaurant. Not deducting the a sin for Roy's monologue is a poor choice as well.
Hey can you do everything wrong with it?
You need to get on this Heathers TV bullshit! I don't care what channel, you have got to get on it. Their taking a amazing, dark movie and turning it to trash!
Do transformers the last night!!! Cinemasins
Do Saw 3 - 3D before Jigsaw come out!
Just to remind everyone who bitches, it is called cinemasins.  They point out problems.
Do Flash Gordon and Ghost Dad!!!
Damn I love this movie, but you got a strong points!
Why the actual fuck is there a crowd made up of only half-naked preteen females dancing behind Jake Paul? Like what the fuck, who's parents would allow that?
To be fair, they were absolutely right about Coca'cola.
for those of you who don't get it:  the entire movie is a dream sequence.  Deckard is dreaming about a better world and because it is a dream, he doesn't know what is real or what isn't.  the film is brilliant.  it isn't a history documentary, idiots.  \n\nof all the crap movies out there, leave this one alone.
You need to sin the rest of the child’s play movies
My grammar sucks. I guessing that's what a few shots of burbon will do. 😳
please do Stephen kings IT 2017
Thank you for pointing out all the same things I noticed as a kid watching this shitty movie. worst of Harrison Ford's career. Almost unwatchable
:( No EWW for the 1986 My Little Pony movie, even though the 2017 film is coming out this Friday. I had my hopes up for nothing.

This was a f**kin' awful movie, I say it deserves double the Sins due to how lazy a director Ridley Scott is.
Do every thing wrong with Diary of a Wimpy Kid The Long Haul please it’s horribly bad
you know everyone wants it, this is just a reminder\n\n\n\n\neverything wrong with IT
You were reminded of your grandmother and decided to sin this movie for it? Fuck you
The nail through the hand isn't a stigmata: Roy's time is almost up, so, he's spiking his adrenaline by shocking his system. You notice his hand seizing up, so, he hurts himself to force his biology's energy reserves; just like we do. Tyrell explains that the androids are biomechanical.
Obviously this guy doesn't know Vangelis...
I love cinemasins but boy they missed the point entirely.
Questionnaire: How would you describe Blade Runner fans?\n\nMe: the most overly sensitive, easily triggered worshipers of a just ok movie ever.
0:33, @CinemaSins, FYI Los Angelos was, and still is a major oil extraction town. The gas flairs were common in oil production in order to burn off excess natural gas. \n\nThere are still oil wells in the middle of downtown LA, they are just hidden behind false building facades.

Lol
She knows no tech
That smile....
TRENDING!!
yes
It looks very nice!
But did u see IDubbz roast Ricegum?
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THISSSSS
yo tengo la go pro 4 ;(
The 5 looks better
glad i didnt buy any go poor cameras.
Camera
Why is this trending
So amazing!
This is amazing
Am I the only one who sees that GoPro hero 5 and IPhone 8+ are better than GoPro hero6
Can i have that? 😂😂😂😂
The lighting on the go pro hero 5 is brighter than the 6, and the iPhone 8 camera is brighter than the other one u were comparing it too, lol
I always don’t know wich one is my hero 5 and 6... so i need to put a label it
Hi ijustine I love your videos I've watched all your videos
Why you so rich????
I want her Minecraft videos back 😭 like this so she can see this
you should do a google home mini and max unboxing and setup when it comes out. I love your videos!!!
Honestly, I'm not fully impressed. The Hero5 looks much better in video as more light is let in, the slo-mo looks way better on the iPhone 8 than the Hero6, and the mic is still really low and hard to understand. All for $100 more than the Hero5's launch price. Thought the Hero6 would bring a lot more to the table. Just my opinion.
Your Hair looked so beautiful When it was Blond. it makes me sad \nyou changed it..
Generally there is certainly definitely simply no magic, working associated along with the app of infant baby heartbeat listener Tracker- Heartbeat monitors listener free completely is dependent on your own phone's equipment.\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appgametechnologies.baby_heart_rate_monitor_listener&hl=en
ok. so. IT seems the hero 6 has better image stablization and higher res but poor lighting.  wow. So ur paying 600$ for  a plastic case and old tech.  CMON GUYS. STOP OVER PAYING for this shit! this costs china 250$ in parts to make. Fuckin christ.
Ugh... you beat me to all the unboxing... I can't do any unboxing because of your channel lol naw I'm j/k  love the video
How rich are you?
Hey justine love you so much i was wondering if you can tell me what was the price for the gopro hero 6 please
It is not as good as the 5
keep going the tech videos
Wait, you need to upgrade your entire OS to play HEVC files on Mac? Lolwut? Even older Android versions can play those, Windows is obviously not an issue at all either. Love ya to bits.
Didn't even know this was announced
Is it just me or is the video quality on the hero 6 kinda crap
Hevc H.265 should be converted tp vp9 H265 to upload to youtube. https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/h265-hevc-converter-mac-windows.htm    works with mac and windows  best of all its free
wtf? SLO-MO IP8+ vs. HERO 6 --> IP8+ is much more better!!!
She must have made a deal with google because first off this video shouldn't even be trending based on the views just check out any other GoPro 6 video, second I have never seen quality that bad from a GoPro product, third she is basically bashing GoPro the whole duration of this video probably because google wants to move in the action camera market with clips but will never compare. Nice work google
The 5 looks a lot better then the 6
The hero six looks good but the colors are a lot better and warmer on the iPhone 8 and Hero 5
Hi ijustine! I think iPhone is much better quality for photography and video than hero 6. Hero 5 is much better than hero 6. More blogs please 😘
What channel is this !!! eh, it's her channel, .. '
Gopros always appear dark and colorless. At least for me.
AAAARRRRRGH!  Just bought the 6 and tried to review video on my iPhone and it says I can't watch it until I update to iOS 11 except that iOS 11 is garbage and I don't want to update!  So many people are having trouble with it!!!  I guess this one is going back to the store.
I really love your videos !!!!!!!! 😂❤️
Great vid. Only just got the hero4. 😆😆. By the way your awesome 👍👍.
In slow mo the iphone is winner super duper smooth..
The barrel distortion is completely unacceptable on the GoPro.  All of the has it.
In a way the Hero 5 had a brighter light setting while the Hero 6 is a bit darker after all as on your previous video you always look sexy.
Hero 6 footage wasn’t as sharp or smooth as the iPhone 8 and/or Hero 5 imo. True action footage may be needed to truly put this thing to the test (although Justine has mad juggling skills). Also could be camera settings or the editing via the unsupported hev
The main difference between the go pro 5 and 6 is, the 6 looks less like a fish lens
I actually like how the GoPro 5 looks better in footage wise.
Love your vids Justine.  Love intelligence and quality.  Keep up the great work!
Yay I've been waiting for this video from you!
I rather buy this then a crappy iphone
I don't know, this is the second GoPro Hero 6 video I've seen and both look really dark. To me, the Hero 5 looks much better.
Hey Justine, I saw the video you did with Linus up in Canada I thought he was very dismissive of you and didn't like it. So I removed him from my Subs. He doesn't deserve you as a guest.
There was a go pro 5?
Is it just me or would they make more money if it was the price of the hero 5 and the 5 dropped in price rather than 6 being $500 and no other price drops? I know I would be more interested in buying one.
I'm still using GoPro 1 and 2.  No need to upgrade if they're still working.
This video showed me that the Hero 5 and an iPhone 8 are better than the new Hero 6, with the exposure and slomo looking better on the other cameras! But I'm curious to see how the audio is on the Hero 6 on the vlog, since I remember last year you saying the Hero 4 had better audio quality than the 5, so I'm curious if they improved on that! Also, I love the variety of the content here :) #notificationsquad
I phone  8 is good
So it looks like the GoPro 6 footage suffered from the file conversion? Because it looked like poop next to the Gopro 5.. :p
the hero 6 is complete trash
It's an any video you want channel :)
buy all of the i phone 8 colors and have a giveaway
FML BOUGHT A HERO 5 A LITTLE OVER A MONTH AGO LOL
Don't blame the drone when you dumb ass don't know how to fly it
It’s just my feeling or the hero 5 is better than hero 6, and the slo-mo 240fps on go pro 6 is crap
The iPhone 8 camera is so much better, why buy the go pro 5 or 6. I’m staying with the iPhone.
5 has better colour, the 8plus is awesome since I have one.
Again.... another comparison with iPhone 8+ and yet.... it doesn’t look good for GoPro
Why is this bullshit trending , #asianjakepaul , 6.6 million in one day . YouTube is broken
Why is this shit trending?? 75K views?? Good mystical morning is below her with more than a million views!
Out of all the people you had to put this bitch on trending for this GoPro
Just use your phone as a camera like me and my channel has so much subs and veiws
Hey Justine ,  you are so cute  but you know what you really need to get a smaller unboxing knife ☺ . I love you . https://www.amazon.in/dp/B01MR5WWN7/ref=cm_sw_r_wa_apa_i_BxA1zbZS7Z84H
Thank you Justine, can you please test the sound and stabilizer. I love and use GoPro 5.
I wonder if the video conversion had anything to do with the underexposed image of the Hero 6.
I think the Hero 6 240fps dropped frames when converted from HVEC.  240 slowed down 25% should give you 60fps which it didn't look nearly that frame rate.  The iphone seemed to keep all the frames.
I wish she could do a cooking video soon. Its been a while.
Can I use hero 5 batteries in hero 6?
I feel bad for Eduardo cox when he grows up and his friends see these they might make fun of him
I personally think its difficult when choosing what to write in the comments section because i really love Anna and Johnathan and how they parent their kids.I love how they are so interactive with them they never ignore them or scream at them and its seems to me the kids are there very first priority in everygthing they do (which unfortunately is not true with all parents).I love to watch their videos everyday and now again (not very often) i might see something that i dont agree with and when you think it   you want to write it in the comments,it doesnt mean  you are telling them how to parent or that you are trolling in any way its just an opinion but unfortunately too many people then get mad or hateful just for giving your opinion.I do know people can leave very mean and hurtful comments and that is just uncalled for but when youtubers post there videos i do think they should be open to people not always agreeing or liking what they do and not all comments will be nice and people may not like or agree with everything they see or hear.\nSorry for the rant.xxxxxxx
This is #11 trending?, YouTube is so broken
Why do u put her on her stomach?!?
I know Anna & Jonathan are very good parents, but I ask myself why they are not interested to give their kids a healthy start of the day (breakfast)? It's always with lot's of sugar & fat. Well, I know it's their decision. I'm just wondering. 💕
Emilia should be in a car seat safety
How much are they paying to get on trending?
Love Alissia’s new cot really pleased you put it down a notch, as she so cleverly turned over. the other thing that makes my heart jump is when Eduardo is on the outside walking along the road when cars go past fast, he needs to be on the inside even though your holding his hand, my heart just misses a beat, hope you don’t mind me saying love the videos and love you all keep up the good work love watching you all, you such a wonderful family  xxx
You guys are amazing parents but jonothan, please next time walk on the road side of the footpath and have the kids on the inside of the foot path!
Jonathon has a big ol beer gut..and anna is a bitch
Why not give the old cot to someone in need if you wanted to buy a new one, rather that leave it behind the door in Alessia's room?
I don't like reading comments when others are trying to tell them how to parent their children. I'm pretty sure they know what they are doing. They have 3 children. Also, they are obviously confident (and rightfully so) with their parenting skills, to share that with over a million people. Good job A & J ❤️ #greatparents
Am i the only one who found the magician kinda hot 😂😂
She's a girl and I'm a girl so she fits in my room -Emilia \nShe should be in my room because I make her laugh and smile -Eduardo \nWho do you guys think had the best logic? I'm team Eduardo hehe, both of them are so cute though, wanting Alessia in their room.
This is trend worthy? Excuse me while I shoot up another school, seems columbine wasn't good enough.
A lovely video I really enjoyed watching it :):) :):) emilia, Eduardo and alessia are so cute emilia was so adorable when she said  well she's a girl and she's a girl and I'm a girl so she will kinda fit in my room 😀🐶❤️ Eduardo was so sweet when he said  she loves me because she smiles at me and laughs at me and alessia looked so cute in her cot bed :):) :):) \n\nJohnathan is a great dad and Anna is a lovely mum x
Lol these guys are losing subs while getting millions of views a month
Who else had like a mini heart attack when Anne-Marie's music was on😍😂

Was that the first time Alessia rolled over?
nursery songs are much cuter sang by children but sadly Jonathan cant let the children sing it he has to take over and sing louder, hes such a self centered little man
No hate here, I’m new here so I’m just curious, but what is that mark on the baby’s head?
Omg time flies alessia is so pretty omg her bed is lush and she is pretty xxx see you in Glasgow going on tour to see them

Not to be rude,but what's that red thing on her head
I put my 6 month old in her own room the other day 😓😭 I have that same monitor it's the only thing keeping me sane haha
Emilia and Eduardo when they see the spider😂😂😭
Not being rude or anything, i'm new to the Alessia videos, but is it a birth mark on her face or?
Ah she’s growing up too fast!
Alessias little teeth 🙊 my son is 11 months old and he still doesn’t have any 😂😩 xxx
Eduardo: Em, em, em..lol, he is so adorable, seriously!!
So cute! Haven't watched the vlogs much since alessia was born, whats the mark on her head?
It's time to build... Not: Its time to build....
Can I just say your skin looks amazing without makeup Anna!
Just to let you no your not meant to use for bumpers or blankets on a baby your meant to use sleeping sacks that's what my health visitor told me after I had my twins x
How uninteresting let me go and watch some paint dry instead. Yawn. Why is this on trending?
The look after anna said she will murder her dog
Aw bless them they fit in the crib so cute xx
I love the dogs' cute little haircuts.  Just adorable!💕
Aww.. Alessia getting her new room is awesome. She is such a sweetie. Eduardo and Emilia are so smart and adorable. I just love your videos. Happy Sukkot to all the Jewish people watching this!!
+sacconejolys im glad to see breakfast can get crazy at someone else's house. With kids, dogs, flying chocolate, and silly husbands.
You should put camera and test the kids at night.
Your dad is 44
Great video guys!!! I was laughing out loud when the kids were running to Alesia's room
The way Eduardo said ahh! there's something outside! was so frickin' adorable!
Babies grow so fast. Look at her such a sweetie. All the kids are sweet . You two are doing a great job.
I cannot allow Alessia to keep growing!!! She's so beautiful and big!!! I can't stand how fast she's growing :(
At 2:06 the face Eduardo made when he was about to lick the pancake dough 😂😂 That's me everytimes I see food!
What kind of chocolate spread they use? Does anyone knows?
Eduardo was so funny eating the chocolate chips from the floor, Lol!!!
I’m so confused with the days of these vlogs. Today is Tuesday but we’re getting Sundays vlog?
You guys are so funny! That's why i love you guys!!

Alessia and her arm circles when she's excited.  😂

Does Anna still do BLW with Alessia? I did BLW for my first but don't plan on doing it for my second. Wondering what Anna's take on it is.
11:30 don't play like that 🔥
Just gonna go murder my dog\n\nOh say good byeeee\n\n😂 nailed it editing J ahahah
No like no I see that spider in my house is burn it down
Anna in the end was hilarious!
I just have to state this, Anna you are so gorgeous without makeup as much as you are when you have makeup on. Your skin looks so pretty! You're just beautiful.
Not to be pushy at all, but are you guys moving or not?  Just wondering.
I can't believe I have been watching since Emilia was a baby and now she's such a big girl. What a beautiful family
Anyone want to help a really small youtuber? We vlog too, we hope to get 500 subscribers:)
Just gonna go murder my dog, xDDD Absolutely love Anna and it's so, so nice to see her picking up the camera more and more. <3
That was a nice surprise! I hadn’t seen Alsessia roll over before.
You maybe already do this but mix new food with some breast milk??
Just going to go murder my dogs lol 😂
wow what healthy breakfasts you have
I love the new crib!! <3 I can't help but giggle when I see Alessias adorable face!! She is so sweet. I have never seen a baby move their hands and arms up and down and in circles over and over. She wants to MOVE hehe :-D
Kids in this town have the coolest birthday parties. I don't think I ever went to a birthday party that wasn't just at the kid's house.
What great parents. I love the consistency at which you guys help your children along in growing up because what you have been doing shows with Emilia and Eduardo already.  Those are some great kids and I look forward to watch alessia grow and learn too.
This is trending?
Who else misses Anna’s baking videos? 😭🙋🏾
Aww bless
Soooo lush!!
So cute!!! 💗
EDUARDO!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Emilia @14:00 💕 bless her heart omg
Best family ever
Jonathan is an awesome dad ❤❤
The ending!!! 😂😂😂❤️
POISON! poison!
new house update?
Aww sp cute
No hate or anything but how come the saccone jolys didn’t mention the Vegas shooting but did the Manchester! A very good friend of mine who loved watching their videos was killed:(
Wow, Alessia rolled over, great to see her being more active and not just laying still like a newborn. She outgrew the Moses basket weeks ago obviously. The day she has more room to move around on her tummy we got to see her roll. Way to go Alessia, now learn to roll back to your tummy, kick those feet up and grab for them and sit up.
I also want to know what the angel care is protecting from...It would have been cool to see Emilia's question answered fully. But its good that the kids understand the general procedure
How do these people get this stuff on trending? Do they pay?
I am confused.  Didn't they buy a house?
I don't want to sound ignorant but what is the mark on Alessia's forehead? Is it from her birth?
Vintage AVGN.
That intro was fuckin awesome
Great episode
Well, Hulk Hogan is someone's drunkin sunburned Grandpa screaming  Hheeeeyyyy!!
I cant stop looking at James' receding hairline lol
Wat will episode 150 be
avgn videos literally make my day
Super video
Great work
Contra series for next!!
AVGN is GOD!!!
No Tecmo Wrestling? .....😦
Ahahaha - AVGN still has it
Man ass
wow the new song sucks asssssssssss :(
Nice promo with tude.
Awesome intro!
dubya see dubya
Comparing Wrestlemania: the arcade game to Mortal Kombat mixed with NBA Jam is actually surprisingly accurate
I've been waiting for a wrestling episode for years! Thank you :D
Put the damn episode numbers in the titles! Pleaaseee!
Undertaker is always the way to go!
we have to push the nerd for summerslam
IS THAT WHERE STRONG BAD FROM HOME STAR RUNNER COMES FROM? HOLY SHIT.
The captions were automatically turned on and they were set to Korean for me lol. It added to the intro experience.
Great video AVGN! This is much needed because wrestling as we speak is suffering from low attendance
Dear Strong Bad, \nhow do you type with boxing gloves on?
Idk this episode seemed to be not the original AVGN-like...
The best content on Youtube. AVGN!
It a time to give up the ghost and shave your head mate. Your hairline is only gonna get worse
Saturday Night Slam Masters was the shit!
Is badder a real word?
I was with you until you said the LJN wrestler figures sucked. No way! Those're rad!
Thank you James!  Son of Monster Madness and two Avgn-Ep so close together. 👏🏼
Your in a studio..... does your room not exist anymore?
Mate that cartridge costume was the fucking dogs bollocks laughed my tits off, something so simple looked so fucking cool great nerd video more plz. Take care and have a good one.
do a video about kinect.
No Rolling Rock this time
Now we need to see White Trash nerd
Aahhh ljn.... fucking piece of shit. Keep up the good work james. I watched you since 2008 or something! Love you😀
Avgn can you please do solstice for Nintendo? Cool music hard game and when you die the scream will be in your dreams
Only wrestling game I've ever owned was WWF Smackdown on ps1. Pretty good game actually
Thanks for making a new video,James!
Good to see you at your best james
Why is it in wrestling they always mount them and pull their leg for the pin? Its like they are trying to get better access to the groin for the sex
Can you play Lord of the Rings on the SNES?
Lol good episode. But the LJN games on super Nintendo were actually quite good, especially Royal Rumble & RAW. Didn't you say that you were enjoying Royal Rumble when you played it few months back just for a play through for Mike and James Play?
Another AVGN episode in less than a month? Shit I'm in Heaven!
LMAO.\nYeah, the Wrestlemania game was fairly decent, except that the AI would cheat all the time like performing special moves when lying on the floor. What a shitload of fuck!
I love it when avgn says man ass
Considering the theme, I totally expected that Spoony will be a surprise guest star.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust kidding.
Didn't expect another nerd episode so quickly! Appreciate it!!
Me and my friends never knew how to play wrestling games. You did some awesome move and you could never re-create it...
I get so excited when a new Nerd vid pops up. Hoping for a Halloween special this year! Good work James and team.
I actually like Wrestlemania Challenge.
Switching to Miller Lite from Rolling Rock???
Did you hear the good news about our Lord and Savior the flex tape?
James keeps pumping AVGN in the last months. I like it man but wow, how do you do it? :D
great fucking,video, you keep getting better
I didn't watch pro wrestling. The closest I ever got was Mucha Lucha. It was a fun little cartoon. 🙂
Lex Luger mentioned in an AVGN episode. Life is complete.\n\nSeriously though, 3 really solid episodes released in 6 weeks or so? NerdaMania lives forever.
I remember playing Wmania on Sega a lot with my friends, it was a lot of fun. Waited for James to comment on it from the start and I knew he'd like it.
Immediately noticed the LJN game.     Oh, cant wait till he gets to that dung heap
Slammasters was a personal favorite of mine
I didn't know that LJN made WWF videogames
Great rendition of the theme song!
SMASH that like button for James!!!
Don't play WWF Warzone and Attitude. Straight trash!
I've been waiting for one of these...
M.u.s.l.e wrestling on new was so good u hat toy ring and fingers you could get
Oh James! Can`t thank you enough for another episode of my favorite show! Especially so soon after the last one! Thank you VERY much! Great episode!
less than 8 hours after uploading this video someone has already added Korean, and only Korean, subtitles. Why???
When I saw Saturday Night Slam Masters I got immediately triggered and whispered don't you dare shit on that game lol !!!
The nerd looks like he's banging the WCW cartridge when he's pining it. A little thrust for each count
had no choice. What ever was at the store to rent was these wrestling games. Not like today were you can get a honest review and know what your renting or buying
Hogan wore a gold cross, that's why...
Glad avgn didn't pussy out and not censor any curse words and shit , much respect.
Awesome intro! Didn't expect another new AVGN so soon, but hey not complaining.
It's real to me damn it!! 🎤🤓😭
I can't tell if that last rant you had took one single take or one hundred thousand.
I’m glad to see that over 10 years later the Nerd is still going strong. Long live the Nerd
Dude... This one was fucking good. I feel like I enjoyed this one more than I should have.
Yes! These are classic nerd episodes
Wrestlemania The Arcade Game was so fun
Didn't you once consider one of the SNES LJN WWF games another surprise good LJN game?
The Nerd is a good authority on wrestling games as a former VGCW Champion.
I'm so happy your back doing these regularly 😁💪👍
A lot of rental money wasted back in those days lol but Funniest episode in a good long while,thanks for the nocturnal laughs.
There NEEDS to be a part 2 to this.
There is one wrestling game on NES that looks worse than any game in this episode. Unfortunately I don't remember how it's called but I surely remember it looks like ass. I was waiting for Nerd to mention it for the whole episode.
I do miss the more relaxed, irritated style from the original videos instead of the over done anger and screaming, but I'm glad new videos are coming out
Awesome episode! I’ve been waiting for AVGN to tackle WWF. Was that Mike in the SNES costume btw? If so great job and happy birthdays as well I saw it on this website  https://www.famousbirthdays.com/people/mike-matei.html
Holy crap the STRONG BADS??\n\nCHAPMAN BROTHERS WE FOUND YOUR SECRET!!!!!!
did you know that WRESTLEMANIA for NES actually was developped by RARE ?!
Fuck where is his hair
I don't like the new nerd sometimes it can be good but the new episodes are shit
Dragon ball for Nes please
Man those LJN SNES games are flippin awesome, still some of my favourite wrestling games (though the Mega drive versions). They look great and feel so good to play!
Gotta say, I had Royal Rumble and remember enjoying it. It played well and had replay value.
I had Pro Wrestling back when I was a kid. That was a fun game,
IF YOU WANT MORE VIDEOS LIKE THIS SCREAM LOUD IN THE COMMENTS AND HIT LIKE ON THE VIDEO BECAUSE OTHERWISE I LIKELY WON'T I JUST NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOUS ACTUALLY ENJOY WATCHING FOR UPLOADING BETWEEN BIGGER PROJECTS OKEIS? Okeis :) ENJOY! xxx

You're like the best friend we all wish we could have. And you cocked the Jenga up hahaha
When I see melanie I keep reminding to myself I'm straight, I'm straight, I'm straight. Like I could become gay for her😍

Congrats Melanie on winning your award! I absolutely loved your film!!! Hope you had a blast in Toronto!! From one died red head to another, I feel your pain about the fade out. I product that I use and swear by the keep my red bright is the Ice Cream Hair mask. I don't know if you have it in Ireland. Literally put it on your hair (dry), leave on for 20mins then wash out as normal. I always get asked if I've re-dyed my hair after I use this stuff. Much love from Toronto!!!! <3<3<3   http://www.inebrya.it/en/products/special-treatments/kromask/cherry-red
would you ever consider only using cruelty free makeup, not trying to be rude or anything I am just curious :) love your videos

If the people knew...: *cut*\nWe will never know... 😔
I follow youtubers for their content and humor mostly, and i subscribed to you cuz your videos somewhat have a calming effect, understandable cuz you have anxiety and you understand what's needed for us to calm down. And your enviable foods from your Food Diary Fridays. Plus, that accent 💚 who wouldve thought you've got all these interesting stories, and the causes you fight for ( physical and mental health, sexuality + lgbt, etc) made you one of my fav youtubers.
I am so proud of you for your work and for winning and ughhhhhhhhh I wish I could hug you!\nAnd yes, I too subscribe and follow people mostly for their personality. You too. <3
I love your chit chat make up. Best ones love youuuu

Loveeee this type of video, it feels more personal :) I tend to follow and subscribe to people who have similar interests too myself and people who if I met them I would deem as someone I would have as a friend :) xxxx love you Mel, keep doing you
Congratulations!! Super happy for you - really, really well deserved!! ❤️

You, Dodie and Hannah are some of my favorite youtubers. I just love all of your personalities!
So gorgeous, love. And so proud of you for winning that award!! xoxo.
Yess, love those videos!! more videos like this!
When you pushed the jenga over you reminded me of a bitchy cat. 😂😂
Congratulations on the award!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Love it congrats you deserve the award 💚 🙂
i was watching your video and thinking 'my god she's the same as me: get late putting make up on, gettin drunk just before an important speech, soooooo true' Thank you for being so real. And by the way, your film is amazing
Well done Mel! You smashed it. There are lots of jealous people out there, and you acknowledge that you ain't perfect (nobody is), but damn it, you put in the effort and for that you deserve it x
I subscribe for personality. Specifically with you and Hannah I'll drop everything to watch your videos, even if the topic isn't something I'm overly interested it. It's personalities.
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR AWARD YOU LOOKED BEAUTIFUL AND IM SO GLAD YOU LOOK SO HAPPY!!!!
Also congratulations :))))) and you were beautiful!!!
Brizzy Voices, Calum and Melanie in one video?! YES PLEASE! 😍💚\n\nAnd congrats on the award, Melanie!!
what makes me subscribe.... I used to watch dozens of people on YouTube but now I'm 26 the people I still watch I could (literally) count on one hand. You, Dodie, Jenn Im, Jessica Clements and Arden Rose. Why? now that I think about it it's because I am 100% crushing on all of you 😂
I AM SCREAMING SO LOUD MY CAT BACK AT MY PARENTS HOUSE CAN HEAR ME (and agrees  ;)) <3 <3
I'm sitting here reading your book and took a lil break to check YouTube and now I'm watching this video. I'm such a stalker haha. Love you!💚
GORGEOUS!!! aw melanie your videos always make my day
AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\nIn case it wasn't obvious, that was me 'screaming loud' because I want more videos like this.
I subscribe to people because of their personality and content
I loved this! I was wondering if you could link what you use? I've been looking for a straightener and yours is perf!
You look so gorgeous Mel!😍 Love you!😘
Loved the outfit it was really pretty and calum looked so cute and congratulations on winning for your short film it was really good
A Day to Remember !!!! <3
Omg I had forgotten that song until it played just now! Brought back so many teenage memories of seeing ADTR at festivals <3
I love chatty get ready with me videos. I love that personal chatty video. I think Hannah is the one who made me love them so much.
Only gotten to the get ready with me portion Melanie but can I just say that you're freaking gorgeous!
After your amazing short film I am so thankful and grateful you won! So deserved! Yay! Cheers love.
Well ye had a grrreat time by the looks of it lol very nice video thnx Melanie.
I enjoy all of your videos, no matter the content! Congratulations on your film and on winning the award!! Loved seeing you have fun with your crew! You looked so glamorous too! Congrats again, you talented gem!!💚
Awww Melanie! Well done girl! 💚 You totally deserve it!
You'll look gorgeous Melanie 😊 Congrats on your award 💕
I follow people mostly for their personality or humor.:)
I was doing my homework ok yes it was art homework that's why I took an hour
I totally follow the people I follow for their personalities. I mean, I have no interest at all in clothes or makeup, but a couple of the people I follow are 'lifestyle' Youtubers. (Zoella is a perfect example) Historically I'll even sometimes follow somebody's vlogging channel and *not* follow their 'main' channel because I like them but I have no interest in whatever silly comedy bit or challenge meme they're doing this week.
I have a rule that I only subscribe to someone as soon as they make me laugh.
I am the same as you in the sense that I used to just watch make up/fashion/ haul videos and youtubers and now I really enjoy watching people with great personality (like you:)) even if its just them chatting about stuff. So proud of you and the short film you've created:)
Riyadh posing for the pic HAHAAHA
CONGRATULATIONS MELANIE!!!! SOOOO PROUD OF YOU DOLL 💚💚💚💚

14:23 That death Look from Chantelle from Buzzfeed / Ladylike!
MELANIE, \nCONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR WELL DESERVED AWARD WIN! \nYour sensitivity, warmth and humanity come through loud and clear in your work and your presence. Your thoughtful conversation, (especially at 7:40) always speaks straight from your heart. And Darling is why you are a stunner inside and out. Keep doing what you do.
I can't remember the last time you posted a video which wasnt on trending😂x
DID YOU JUST SAY OBAMA IS IN YOUR HOTEL?
Melanie giving her drunk thank you speech is definitely my second favourite award acceptance, after Hazel with her bloody glass of wine of course <3
Are you still cutting back on sugar because of your teeth like you mentioned in a video a few months ago ?
Hahaha I'm so glad you liked the chocolates! Sitting sick in bed coughing my brains out and watching your vlog is the only thing making me feel better. LOVE YOU GIRLIE!
oh shit, i’m sorry i was so awkward when you were filming!!! but it was lovely meeting you, and you are quite hilarious when you’re drunk. 💖 congratulations again on your big win!! you’re so deserving. sending lots of love your way!
I first subscribed to you when you first did your beauty videos and I do still love beauty videos (I find that they're weirdly calming and good for my anxiety, almost ASMR-like) but I've always been subbed to you for your personality.
1. John Wick chpt 2\n2. IT \nSo far in my books....\nlet's see if blade runner gonna do
I read that first cut of the movie was at least 3 hours 50 minutes but the studios cut 1 hour of footage
I've watched the film. I agree with everything what Chris said. This is something that u need to watch in a cinema. Also, besides the visual, the story is just as beautiful.
A Friend of my mine has what they call a Press Pass List for all press outlet's in the U.S who get's the see the movie online or other  press...this dude was NOT on that List.....He 100% did NOT see Blade Runner 2049, he read the IMDB  synopsis & Saw the Trailer......FAIL!!!!!!!!!
SHIT , THE REVIEW NOT THE MOVIE.
Do you need to watch the first BladeRunner before going in? Because I haven't. \n\nI can catch it tonight if it really is not necessary, if it really stands on its own without much reference to the original.
No Country For Old Men was the film that made me want to make films.
Yep, that's pretty much it. There Will be a before and after blade runner 2049
Yo dope stuff man!! it'll be dope if u'll check out some of our vids, we're all bout dat good vibe
Thank fuck I have imax tickets for the best screen in London this evening. I’m thrilled
I hope this changes Hollywood.  We need a game changer in the U. S badly.
now I cannot wait to see this movie. Have been excited since saw trailer for the first time. this is going to be good :)\n\noh.. and what about the soundtrack? first moves vangelis music is fantastic.. hope this is also on par..
Can't wait to see it. Gonna rewatch the first one again. Thanks, Chris!
Prisoners was the first movie that made me a huge fan of Denis Villeneuve, after that I watched Arrival, Sicario, Enemy, and Incendies. I must admit, he is one of the best directors of this era. Top three best directors, for me.
I just watched it on a special premiere in my country and I could not agree more with Chris! Please go watch it, it sure is a one of a kind masterpiece
Thought you were going to give this movie an *S* for a minute. haha
saying it's one of the best movies of 2017 is like having the best case of kidnapping this has been the worst year for movies because videogames are making them look bad and do an evil within 2 review
Great review. Want to see it
Who gives a fuck about cinematography and the Oscars shit? What matters is the SUBSTANCE of the story.
I’m calling it without even seeing it yet:This movie doesn’t actually take place on Earth.
Sadly, there are so much idiots who don't know this is a squeal and thought this is some kind of action packed pop corn movie.\nSo many idiots sitting in the IMAX theater yawning, while this breath taking images and sound are playing.\n\nWhat a waste. :(
Cant wait, Might try and Watch in on iMAX 😁
Smart girls will like this film dumb girls will not.......dumb girls like fifty shades of retarded.
lowkey calling out Star wars, I see you Chris.
Do you need to have seen the first one, to understand and enjoy this one?

A sequel to a 35+ year old all-time classic film that should in no way have a sequel that has one of the best directors in the world right now, the best living cinematographer, one of the best composers, and one of the best casts of the year, absolutely MUST be great, otherwise I've lost all faith in cinema. BTW, Villeneuve is apparently working on DUNE. Let that sink in.
JUST CAME OUT OF GOLD CLASS, 10/10  SENSATIONAL, do you have to watch the original before you go?  You don't have to but it will make it a far more superior experience knowing the original.
Your one little complaint reminds me a lot of Arrival honestly. It was a great movie and all, but there were frustrating moments where they didn't expect the audience to figure things out on their own and annoyingly spelled it out more than necessary.\n\nSPOILERS FOR ARRIVAL\n\nThey did such an amazing job of letting all the pieces fall into place without the need for explanation, but then obnoxiously explain it anyway. When she calls out who is this child? it immediately hits you, oh fuck, those weren't flashbacks at all, the child in all those visions she's been having isn't actually born yet. They of course felt the need to spell that out immediately after by having the alien just flat out say you see the future now lmao.\n\nWhat frustrated me more though was that they show her making the decision to have a baby and that was enough to make all the drama in these flashbacks make sense. It's well established that whoever the father is of the child, she made some decision that enraged him and he left. Then we learn that Hawkeye is the father and the child came AFTER all the events of the movie, meaning after having all those visions of the kid on their deathbed. She obviously knew and willingly inflicted that grief on them anyway. It feels nice and subtle and has a lot of punch. But then of course...\n\nMommy why did daddy leave?\nWELL HONEY IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS DISEASE THAT IS VERY DEADLY AND CAN'T BE CURED, WINK WINK
Movie sounds great, but than again he kinda sounds like he's just promoting the movie because he was asked to or he has some hidden bias towards it. Guess we'll see, kinda skeptical ever since he ranked Dunkirk so high, worst movie to ever hit the screen in history imo, should have been lower than F.
I wanted to know how dave batista did in that movie
we won't disappoint you.
Ok but do electric sheep dream of androids ?
ur eyes are fatasses. Yeah, that's it.
Do we have to watch the original though?
I always trust your opinion, Chris! I go to see most of the movies that you recommend and never leave the cinema disappointed! I will definitely check out Blade Runner 2049. Thank you X
I really, really expected this movie to suck, based on the trends it should have. I am so happy that this film is not only good, but a god damn masterpiece.
I haven't seen Blade Runner before I heard Blade Runner 2049. Then I watched your review on Blade Runner 2049 and was like alright, looks like I'm gonna love this. Then just a few minutes ago I luckily found Blade Runner for free online. And holy crap that was just amazing. I know it's just the first time I saw it and am definitely going to watch it plenty more. I am already excited for Blade Runner 2049. I have high hopes.
Would see it but jared faggot leto is in it
I gotta get stoned as a rock for this.
this is a great review man, you just, summed it up, let us know how you felt....gave nothing away.  I can't wait to see it!
Hopefully you can review Incendies sometime! I feel like that one never got enough attention.
Stuckmann: - posts photo of himself with replicants to prove he’s not repliphobic -
Me personally, I love this film. Me personally.
I get the impression that you liked this film. Lol.  Is it better than the original though?
Watch the first Blade Runner movie. Then go to the theater to see the sequel.
tryna put the blame on other critics when you fuckin spoil movies all the god damn time
This is probably the first time he gave Villeneuve an A+, while most people kept giving him a much higher grade with his previous work.
Great video. Looking forward to seeing this.
Congrats on the top 25 trending videos on YouTube!!!! Also very excited to see this film! Can not wait
Awesome review. I can't wait for this to hit red box or maybe just buy the bluray.
Well if you guys saying its worthit i believe but still looks too clean and too bright for me. It misses the rusty enviroment the master-piece has. Doesn't have the man Sir Rutger Hauer. Cant be not even close as good as the first one. I miss the 70's the 80's and 90's regarding movies and music. Nothing is new now. All original creativity is dead. Im ready to die cause this planet is filled with spirit poorness...mainstream comsumption...wars...terror everywhere...womens with no respect for themselves...greedy politicians...corruption. The reason i wont comit suicide is just because i dont have the courage to inflict that on me.
Never seen the original film but this looks pretty solid.
1:19\n\nFuture filmmaker over here 🙋🏽‍♂️\nGoing to watch it on Friday, the first one is my all time favorite movie.
Do you think i need to watch the original to understand this film?
I'll have to go and see this.
i can't to go see this movie.
When you want to watch a movie without opinions or reviews first.
Man this movie looks a lot like human revolution.... Holy shit i need to watch it right now
I love your review, I was 22 when Ridley Scott's original came out, and i felt the same way when I saw that film.
so just to be clear.  People do not need to watch the 1st blade runner to be able to watch and understand this movie, ya?
I just saw this movie. Brilliant. Your review summarises my experience perfectly. I can’t get over how good it is.
Pre-ordered imax tickets, thanks for the recommendation chris!
Do I need to watch the first blade runner to enjoy 2049?
This is my most anticipated movie of the year and I'm psyched to hear it's that good. I love the visuals, the soundtrack, the atmosphere, the cast, the director, everything about this just clicks right. The fact that Denis Vileneuve cares so much about the movie not being spoiled tells a lot about how great a director he is. I cannot wait to get bored watching this one!
so can i see it without watching the prequel first?
Having just watched it in IMAX 3D, I totally agree: this is one for the ages. I would even go so far as to say it's got a more profound emotional resonance than the original, which I wasn't expecting at all.
I'm sorry if this is a stupid question, but do I have to watch the original movie in order to understand this? Or is it fine for first-timers? My friend invited me to watch it and I don't want to look like a fool in front of him.
For the people saying do I need to watch the first to understand the second? While I don't believe it will be bad without the first, it won't be amazing as it is if you've watched the first. Also why the fuck haven't you watched the first? It's incredible!
I'm watching this in The Seattle pacific science center IMAX at its first timing. One of the best theaters in America. I'm sure I'll love the experience lol
Okay, but when does the director's cut come out?\n\n\n\n\n(Kidding)
I am making my wife and adult daughter watch the original Blade runner so we can go see this.
well i'm sold, I'm watching it asap
Franchise reference to Star Wars much lol
This was the worst movie review you have done stop listening to rich directors
So uh,  we some kinda... Blade Runner 2049?
God its so relieving that the movie you hope would be good turn out to be fucking fantastic, props to Denis Vill, Ryan and Harrison!
Not a single review in YouTube has even mentioned the fact that SIR RIDLEY SCOTT produced the film. He created the basic story of the sequel and made the writers create the script for him. He approved the script. He chose Villeneuve as director who refused at first but agreed to direct after reading the very good script. Sir Ridley Scott was behind this film the whole time. If it gets an Oscar for best picture it will be him who will pick it up. Mark my words...
Gives major plot point then immediately talks about how he's mad about people giving major plot points...
I should probably go see the original blade runner first huh?
I will never understand what seems to be American bias against Christopher Nolan! imo the best director of his generation and one of the best of all time! \nI apprecitate Denis Villeneuve, Ridley Scott, James Cameron, Quintin Taratino etc etc but they are not in the same league as Sergio Leone, Stanley Kubrick, John Carpenter, Alfred Hitchcock, Christoper Nolan
Gg

What is the name of the movie he mentions after Prisoners at 3:55? I cant understand it. Anyone help?
Sometimes reporting on these things hits me hard. I know I've said it before, and I'll continue to say it but please call, text, email, or better yet tell someone in person you love them today. The world can be so cruel and our time isn't guaranteed. In case someone hasn't said it to you today, I love ya, Nation. <3
I called my Grandma at 1am... She was not happy...
Gun control will work, because everyone knows criminals always obey the law and will turn their all their guns in; because it's the right thing to do. #thoughtsandprayers
It was a falseflag
who cares where going to have never ending terrorism in future anyways. alah akbar
So here's some evidence of the effectiveness of gun control laws, summarizing this article from a neutral source: \n\nhttp://www.factcheck.org/2017/10/gun-control-australia-updated/\n\n-Australia suffered a gun massacre in 1996: 35 dead, 18 injured.\n-The National Firearms Agreement was passed as a result. Some semi-automatic rifles and shotguns were banned and stricter registration/licensing policies were implemented. There was also a huge amount of buybacks, and 700,000 guns were sold to the government. Laws were further tightened in 2002.\n-There were 23% fewer homicides in 2013 than there were in 1996, though some fluctuation in between.\n-13 gun massacres happened in the 18 years before the NFA, 0 gun massacres in the 18 years after.\n-“In the seven years before the NFA, the average annual firearm homicide rate per 100,000 was .43 (range .27 to .60) while for the seven years post NFA, the average annual firearm homicide rate was .25 (range .16 to .33).”\n-“The number of homicide incidents involving a firearm decreased by 57 percent between 1989-90 and 2013-14”\n\n*This doesn't prove or disprove anything*  Whatever your opinion, I encourage everyone to do their own research. Have a great day, stay alive |-/
I can't really comment on the laws and gun control in the United States as I have never been there.\nThat being said. Being an Australian and living with our gun control laws that were implemented after only ONE mass shooting, I can send my nieces and nephews out in public without the constant thought of if they will be shot to death by someone who got their hands on a weapon because background checks weren't carried out correctly.\nI have never understood why anyone would need Semi/Automatic weapon as personal protection and it shouldn't be allowed. \nA small hand gun is good enough for your home and that is where they should stay. Locked up in your home, to protect you in your home.\nEveryone spewing that any change to the laws regarding weapons will remove your freedoms... why do you need guns to be free? If you do, clearly you're not free and you should probably look at why you need a weapon to feel it.
The shooter had no criminal record and was cleared of all background checks.  He purchased most(or all) of the guns legally.  Tell me, how could you have predicted that this one person would've committed the worst mass shooting in the US to date? The fact that he was able to get his hands on SO many weapons without a blip in the system goes to show the weakness in our system.  Yes, people kill people but guns facilitate the killing. A valid reason to have a single or limited firearm would be for instance, running a jewelry store. But the fact that this scum of the earth got his hands on so many guns without raising a red flag is the issue here.  If he had just a single handgun, there would be far fewer casualties.  \n\nIf other countries are able to implement effective gun control, eliminating future mass murder cases, why can't we? \n\nThe second point that Franco notes is also very important - the media is glorifying these killers. There should be laws for these criminals to remain unnamed and to focus solely on the victims.  People who commit crimes like these want the attention in their own very sick ways but we should wipe their existence from our minds and memories asap.
Hey team huge fan of the show from the Dubai.  Love getting my news from outlets like yours because I can see the unbiased truth unlike the news. \nEvery Country has flaws in their leadership and their government.  But the death of innocent people for any reason whatsoever is devastating.  Im not a gun person (out of smart decisions made by the government here) but I do understand protecting yourself and family in this age we live in.  But the sale and possession of automatic weapons to ANYONE must not be discussion it's common sense.  As citizens you all have the right to fight for common sense.  Taking the life of innocent people is just wrong.
Why did it take an hour for police to get to the shooter in the hotel
NOTHING happens in one of those hotels without it being on camera.  Where are the videos of him carrying all those guns in?
Wierd how they live in 320 and Stephen was on floor 32.... \n\n\n\nSomethings off...
It was a false flag setup. Please read what an investigator sent me, quoted below.\nVegas shooter:\n\nPerfect record, shows anyone can do it.\n\nAmassed guns starting when trump was elected.\n\nNo social media or traceable history OTHER than the perfect paper trail he left for the crime. No apparent motive. Fuels fear, also fits with portrait of a professional.\n\n27 residences, a lot of money, seems like a CIA operative who had his background scrubbed and tailored. No political affiliation creates mystery and sews doubt on both sides. \n\nAll legal weapons and mods, things that can now be viably targeted by legislation.\n\nCarefully and intelligently planned, yet didn't disable smoke detectors? Wanted to be found. No military training yet looks like a professional job that's been designed to look just enough like a smart yet amateur job from the outside. Yet many small details indicate much more professional than led to believe.\n\nAt least 3-4 shooters, one reported at ground level. Very easy to replace windows. Shooting rate of 500 impossible in 10 minutes for one person. Most mass shootings leave only 1 man to take one for the team and get everything pinned on him. Knew he was gonna die.\n\nEntrances to concert venue all completely blocked except for one.\n\nWoman and man telling everyone they're gonna die. Both described as being much shorter than the shooter\n\nWhole scene looks picture perfect to make case for gun control. No need or use for 23 weapons in the hotel room, only two of which have the bump fire stock, when he could obviously afford to equip them all. only used a couple of them. No ak's visible in photos, where was the ak sounding weapon from the videos? Only 308 present was not equipped with bump stock, wasn't used. No security footage showing him bringing up multiple bags with so many. Where's all the expended brass if one person is supposed to have fired several thousand rounds alone? The amounts we see are small and scattered in spread out patterns and places they wouldn't be. At such a constant cycle the piles would be far more consistent, not just a couple here and a few there. Only a couple dozen on the floor.\n\nOnce shooting started stage lights lit up the crowd, illuminating them for the shooter.\n\nIsis claims responsibility but it's IMMEDIATELY dismissed by both fbi and CIA. Isis claims a lot, its the dismissal that's disturbing
If one guy can do this to like 500 people can you imagine what all the gun owners can do against an invading foreign army I mean seriously
If you listen to the the entire police scanner the police say multiple times there were multiple shooter's. More fake news! If people thought the shooter's were still out there Vegas would be a ghost town.
My parents always taught me to have an exit plan in every situation and place I enter... \nWhere my parents able to predict the future or just really smart?
WHEN A MUSLIM KILL SOMEONE ATTACKING HIM ...IT'S TERRORISM ....... BUT WHEN A WHITE AMERICAIN KILL 59 PEOPLE AND INJURE 551 .......WELL HE IS JUST A POOR LONE WOLF THAT NEED HELP .......... THE WORLD NEVER USED THE WORD TERRORIM SINCE USA USED IT ...........SORRY TO SAY THIS BUTUS PEOPLE ARE ALSO TERRORIST AND THEY KILL PEOPLE MORE THAN ANY ONE ON EARTH  ...........3 MILLIONS ONLY IN IRAK
It's blatantly obvious you can here to guns firing at the same time
Anyone else see the leaked photos of the crime scene? Whole thing doesn't feel right.\n1. The gunman definitely was shot through the mouth, but in the picture there are empty 5.56 casings.... on top of the blood splatter, with no blood on them. The means he was dead before the casings landed.\n2. They claim he shot himself with a revolver. The revolver in the pictures next to him has no visible casings inside. It looks empty.\n\nFrom video footage of the shooting:\n3. The rate of fire was not that of an AR platform. I have looked up videos of full auto ARs and ones with bump fire stocks like the media is claiming. Both shoot too fast. The rate of fire is almost exact to an M240 Light machine gun. Look up the guns for yourself on youtube. Compare it to the Vegas footage.\n\nI'm not usually a conspiracy theorist it just worries me that if there was a second shooter or if this guy got set up, the real killer is still out there and his trail is getting colder every day
I have respect for the victims and the families victims and those who have been affected but I have no sympathy for the situation. Oh my god how did this happen? I wonder? Maybe it's all the guns you have in America? Nah? Sorry But I really need to know something. Do Americans actually believe that guns make them safe? Or do they enjoy living in their own ignorance? As an Australian, I have never understood this issue. Australia had 1 mass shooting over 30 years ago and now guns are banned in Australia without very strong regulations and reasoning. How many people have to die for people to realise that guns are the problem. That there are as many guns in America as there are people. How many more mass shooting do you need to open your eyes? I never believed it when people said Americans where the most stupid people in the world...... But now I know I was wrong.
Honestly what I think about this entire dilemma is that the guns aren't the ones killing people. IT'S THE PEOPLE KILLING EACH OTHER. So illegalizing the purchase of guns isn't gonna do jack-shit. People might agree, people might disagree, but this is once again, just my opinion. So don't go all super-sayian on my ass. The guy who started the shooting is American, which only makes things worse. And after the shooting he shot himself dead. But that didn't stop police from identifying him so his name and face is all over the news now. And as soon as the shooting was all over the news, guess what the unintelligent, stone-hearted people of the world did? OF COURSE THEY GO AND MAKE RUDE MEMES ABOUT IT! And that isn't cool! Same thing goes for 9/11 memes! They're not cool and need to be stopped! THREE TO FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED IN THE ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11th! 1 billion people across the world watched as the World Trade Center in New York City collapsed due to a hijacked passenger airplane crashing straight into it. Other hugely popular terrorist attacks get noticed as memes now! Examples are; The Boston Bombing, Charlottesville, The Paris Terrorist Attacks, and other catastrophic terrorist attacks. And we have lost some of the most life-changing people ever throughout the 21st century. For example; Steve Jobs (the creator of Apple) Hugh Hefner (the original creator of the ENTIRE Playboy franchise). Overall this is my take on all of this. So I shouldn't get hate. #PrayforVegas
there is no common sense about common sense gun control. the ONLY way to truly do what these people want would be to comb through the entire country and take everyone's guns by force. Even IF you could pass this law, I don't think you understand just what this would be asking of everyone involved or how much it would cost. And even IF we did that, found all the civilian guns and took them without starting a full on anarchy? we'd need to lock down borders to prevent smuggling guns in. We can NEVER say it won't happen again. we NEVER will. Sorry.

It's never an act of terrorism when it comes to white people. Believe it or not but if it were a minority of ANY color, it'd be a terrorist act.
Phil have you ever heard of the New World Order or the illuminati?? Las Vegas is likely a staged  False Flag event by the illuminati/NewWorldOrder/Globalist/Deep State to stir up anti-gun legislation. They don’t want the American people to bear arms to oppose their efforts for a future takeover. It’s  a “psy-opt” or psychological operation, where there will be other so-called terrorist attacks repeated throughout the country to create an apparent “problem” to which they will offer a solution (*gun control), thus the Hegelian dialectic. With these deliberately staged “terrorist” acts, they want to create so much fear to make the American masses willingly give up their guns, so will be easier to control and rule in the future! Stephen Paddock is just the “patsy” they setup to take the fall, along with insinuations that it was ISIS related. Everyone needs to wake up before it’s too late!!!
I believe it's our government. Depopulation in full swing and take more rights away! Civil/Race war agenda. I believe it's us against the elite. If only we could get pass the color of our skin!
Who and why would people dislike this
GUN SCARE! All you smart business boys out there better buy black, scary AR-15 type rifles because their value is sure to increase!
I own guns and have never had an accident that being said if the USA banned guns, I would be happy to i follow the law and would gladly give them up if it was illegal to own guns. I believe that law abiding citizens would follow the law, however, how can you promise/make sure all criminals with guns would follow the law? and thats were i'm concerned that it can never work to ban guns. yes it would reduce the number of guns but only in the hands of the innocent.
He can't keep getting away with this...
It took 1 hour for police to get there? Wtf
This is what it looks like when the world is run by liers.
Nothing is going to change. If it didn't change with Sandy hook it will not change. Unfortunately it'll most likely happen again. Which fucking sucks
What's really dark is that now, I'm becoming incredibly. . .detached  as more and more wild shit happens around the world. When I heard this and I heard the death toll, I felt sad but i just  like well there is another day on earth.\nI know, it's dark, it's pretty pathetic, but it's gotten to the point where it doesn't surprise me anymore it's just something that's expected
Why the heck did a 64 year old man kill people would you like a 64 year old man maybe a grandpa killing your friends or maybe your grandbabies just heartless
Thank you for this video Phil. It will never be fair that one awful person decided I will never get to see my friend Nicol again, but your words and your constant support is very appreciated <3
high incident project 👀 it's all planned bruh
If you believe they put a man on the moon.
*Every* action we take is a political statement. You're absolutely right, we don't need to see what he liked on facebook to call him what it is, because his motive is inherently political. What exactly it pertained to is the only thing we don't know.
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, often called THPS2, is the second game in the Tony Hawk's series. It was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision in 2000. It was first released for the PlayStation, with subsequent ports to the Nintendo 64 (by Edge of Reality), SEGA Dreamcast, Game Boy Advance (by Vicarious Visions), Mac OS, and the Windows PC (By Gray Matter Interactive). It was also released for the Game Boy Color, and was better received than the first installment on that machine. In spite of that, it still bore little resemblance to the other versions of the game. The Game Boy Advance version, however, was highly applauded for translating the style and sense of the game accurately into an isometric (pseudo-3D or 2.5D) game. On April 1, 2010 a remake (downscaled from the PC version) for iOS devices was released.
May there be many more terror Attacks in America, until all Ameritards are extinct.
Philip in times like these I always find myself going to your news site. I can always depend on you for weeding out truth from rumors and lies. You are always mindful not to be divisive and to encourage others to do good regardless. Our country needs more people like you. Thank you a nd keep it up.
Gun control is not a problem
it doesn't have to be tied with the terrorist group but to be as a lone wolf the word terrorist means terrorizing people what this man did was terrorizing a group of innocent people and I hope this man is judged
mk ultra is real wake up
This guy should be news only. He's better than the actual news.
The guns are easy to get in the room. Tgey just put a couple in your clothes bag and send it up with the bell hop. Very easy been done by people i know that went shooting out in vegas and stayed at tropicana and did not want to leave guns in car so put them in bag and put on bell hope..
Do you think it was done by 1 man? If you hear the video of gunfire slowly, you can hear 2 automatic weapons being fired at the same time.
Phil, I love your work, but I'd like to point out that lonewolf is often just used as shorthand for Lonewolf terrorism, which this is a definite case of. So the terms Lonewolf and terrorist in this situation are fairly interchangeable.
Thank you for the respect you have on this situation Phil. As a Las Vegas local, this has by far been the hardest situation I've had to go through in my life. I've had coworkers and friends who were injured or killed. This event has just destroyed what security we knew in our lives here, and the folks playing the political game aren't helping either. This is a time of mourning for all of us here in Vegas.
thoughts and prayers are not enough!
Isis didn't do this shit they just want attention
I'm not saying that there is no possible ways it's terrorism, but it wouldn't be classified as that if he were to have had a mental breakdown or just went plain pyscho. Because the definition of terrorism is acts or violence that are motivated by something larger, like religion or politics. Just want to say that
I think there is more to this story. Guy with apparently no motive, goes through extensive planning, to buy and prepare this much fire power; generally madmen dont go through this much planning and preperation, there must be some larger motive. Its possible he could just have wanted to go down in history, but I have doubts, its much more likely there was some kind of ideological motive, whether it be religious or political.
Can we address the fact that that chickenshit ran offstage and didn't say a f****** were to the people in the concert. You didn't tell them to exit calmly he didn't ask them to leave he didn't tell them to get out of there he ran he f******  ran
*bad thing happens* GUN CONTROL *four months later completely forgotten.* *another bad thing* GUN CONTROL. Seriously. Something either needs to actually happen or not.
Terrorism is a politically motivated act that is used to try and incite terror in the population. You can't call something terrorism until you know the motive behind it. This guy could just be a crazed murderer, not a politically motivated terrorist.
I'm tired of hearing about mass shootings
Do what Mr. Rogers mom said to do in times of tragedy, look for the helpers. When ever something bad happens, you can always find people helping.
Vietnam is still a nasty place while Thailand is the land of a thousand smiles. Maybe America is suffering from the same sort of Darwinism... all the good people died in that war.
This guy was basically a real life Stephen King villain. IRS accountant, gambling enthusiast, millionaire, mass murderer. An American success story.
I don't understand why its so hard to have an honest debate in America about gun control. A blanket gun ban has helped many countries become safer. I understand that the issue of black market guns would be a huge hurdle - but America is far from being a civilized nation with it's current course. \nThe whole country is propped up on superficial industries (much more so than most first world nations), and the gun industry is one of them - I understand losing it would be a huge economical blow, which is what the right is afraid to admit - just as the left is afraid to admit that they do indeed want an all out gun ban. \nWatching from the outside it seems like the spiral in the U.S. is just continuining, with major issues like distaster relief and the education system, the rehabilitation system for criminals, taxes and practically every major political issue being subverted to enhance the lifes of a few powerful people (left or right). The debt to China is massing in amounts that will make the U.S. a surrogate state with practically no political influence over Asia - and instead of having an honest discussion of why the American Dream has fallen so low, it seems like you squabble like children about who can read document from 1787 the best. \nIt really is disheartening to see such a great country fall so low. I truly and honestly hope America finds its way back to a strong and just nation, looking out for its people, and the people around the world - but right now the dream of being the best country in the world is an illusion with practiaclly no justification behind it.
Videos show multiple broken windows on the 10th and 32nd floor, and also security shooting at people on the ground.
I wouldn't be surprised if this guy was a white ally of Blacklivesmatter or a self proclaimed modern day John Brown. 😕
The sad part is people on the internet are going to start making memes about this

You're a coward. Look at the platform you have. You ran from this debate. You care more about being liked on YouTube than making a stand. You absolute coward.
They send thoughts and prayers because they are showing sympathy, not because they do that to show off or do that to try and stop another shooting. Of course thoughts and prays dont stop shootings, but thats not the point. The point is that they are just showing some sympathy, or at least some of are, to people who probably lost love ones pier to the shootings.
of course isis claims to be responsible, makes them more of a boogie man.
No, we don't.
I know a couple people who were there that made it out safely. Also, my brother is an EMT and my cousin is a cop. They were both there that night helping evacuate people.
If there is no objective moral standard, why is this wrong?
Trump Blames Puerto Rico For Running Up His Budget\nhttp://ecut.io/MQhOOYr
Lol these hick's have to pay the price. remove gun's it works.
Illegal guns were the weapons used. Gun control has nothing to do with it. It shouldn't have been able to obtain them. Where he got them, as of right now, no one knows.
Love all of you guys <3 Love you Phil.
It's funny, those that know the least about guns are the ones that want to regulate them the most. Their has been full automatic guns for over 200 yrs. Dating back to the Gatling Gun, or the Tommy gun in the early 1900s. What has changed is the people, we now prescribe medication that makes you feel nothing (good or bad), and more than not mass shooters are users of these medications. We now have video games that are so realistic in how you can butcher people, that some games reward you for how horrific you can be.

People don't seem to realize something important about gun control. If you take away these guns, you're not stopping criminals, you are stopping law abiding people who are currently able to defend themselves if they are attacked. I've seen comments stating they don't understand why gun control wouldn't reduce shootings I personally don't understand how it wouldn't increase them? You are taking away legal guns from people who can defend themselves from a criminal using an illegal gun. Who is going to lose a gun in that case? Only the innocent one.

No we don't
The right of the people to keep and bears arms shall not be infringed. \n\nThey who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.” Benjamin Franklin, Memoirs of the life & writings of Benjamin Franklin.
Let's put it this way, if every single person at the concert had a gun on them, nothing would've changed. Regulations, however, could've changed things. If he couldn't legally buy more than one gun, would this have happened? If he couldn't legally own anything besides a handgun/shotgun, would this have happened? Sadly, maybe... But at least it would've been less likely due to it being substantially more difficult...
You talk far too quick why?!

It was my birthday
Tragic event, imo america should have banned guns years ago. I'd have to disagree on calling this act 'domestic terrorism' because the murderer wasn't pushing a political agenda, I'd call it mass murder. Rest in peace to the victims
Instead of them introducing Uncle Benjin during this time and having a reunion with Jon, they decided to spend thousands if not millions on a stupid ass polar bear. They could have sent Benjin to the wall to get Davos to send ravens instead of having gendry run 30 miles an hour to get there.
If you're gonna spend such a shitload of money on CGI instead of good writing, good dialog, character development and all the things that made the series great, at least toss it on Ghost instead of a single superheroes movie action scene with a damn polar bear.
Sack D&D and remake season 7 with proper writing. What a load of shit it was, completely put me off the show now. Zero hype for season 8...
Ghost or Nymeria >> Unnecessary zombie polar bear
I'm so loving the comment section
This scene was unnecessary, why didn't you use it to build up Benjins return instead? The writers of this season was stupid as shit, people didn't start liking GOT because of the crazy action but because of the characters, and although action is awesome, it gets tasteless if you don't have a good plot line to follow it. Please get good again in the last season thanks
Dear Game of Thrones: FYI, for S8 we would rather have the direwolves over war elephants from Essos... Sincerely, The Fans\nP.S. No one wanted a fooking polar bear when we could have had scenes with Ghost!
Quit bragging about something that is literally the biggest waste of time and resources in the entire show. I still liked this season, but it's no secret the writing has taken a nosedive recently, and when keep seeing you guys talking about your zombie polar bear you had to work so hard as a team to get in, it makes me realize just how much worse at writing compelling entertainment the Davids are than George.
Of all the things in season seven, this bullshit is what pissed me off the most (besides Littlefinger and the Jonerys buffoonery) This story is supposed to be about people. It's supposed to be about treachery and relationships and the complexity of human nature. It's not spending millions of dollars on a fucking zombie polar bear. D&D are completely stupid and I'm starting to wonder if they read the first two books, got bored, and then just read spark notes to get them through the rest. They care more about their friendships with the actors than the dialogue the actors speak (bad pussy, dickon jokes, Tyrion and little finger's entire script) they're more about shock value than cohesive plots and actions for the characters that make sense (Jon giving up the north even though Dany had already consented to fight with his people and Arya wanting to kill Sansa) and most obviously, they care more about big action set pieces and pointless dragon/ polar bear scenes than Jon being with the direwolf that represents his connection with his REAL family, the Starks (because Ghost being with him at Dragonstone would remind him of the family that we literally see him ignore except to write *once* in the months he spends on the island). This is really long and congrats of you got to the end but in conclusion: D&D can go fuck themselves. We don't need these fuckers in charge.
We didn’t even see Ghost in season 7! Sansa only mentioned him :(
waste of money
I appreciate the bear but would have preferred Ghost . Atleast once in the season.
Why the fuck is a zombie polar bear cool again??? \n\nD&D are fucking idiots.
If somebody ever asks me what's so bad about being mainstream, I will point them to this fucking polar bear.
You included a zombie bear rather than having ghost or even good fucking writing
Less polar bear, more dire wolf please
Fuck this bear I want Direwolfs because they are essential to the story. But nobody cares about story, right? \nThis used to be my favourite show but now I just hope you spend some money on the scripts for S8 because I don't fucking care about zombie bears, ice dragons and some forced relationship that is only there to satisfy the average viewer that only watch this show because it is over hyped  and can't even fucking remember the the names of the main characters. \nI care about characters and their relationships and developments and about a logical plot that comes to an satisfying end and a world without good or bad where actions have consequences and violence is real and terrible and not glorified. \nI am sorry but I had to say this. Here is some constructive criticism: Dear D&D, dear writers, go back to seasons 1-4 and learn from it. \nBudget is not everything.
Complete waste of money that did nothing for the story....jackasery
People are seriously upset with this? Geez, there's no pleasing anyone these days
This bullshit sums up the terrible transformation this show has undergone. I first fell in love with this show not because of pointless spectacular cgi like this, that was basically nonexistent in season 1. I fell in love with the incredibly rich and complex story, the likes of which i had never seen before. Now the story is pretty simple and straightforward, and terribly predictable, and instead of putting effort into the story, the very soul and heart of every show/book/movie, they give us pointless shit lile this.
Hit the play button, fluffed my pillow behind my back, sat back to watch the Zombie Polar Bear - video already finished.\nThanks fooking Game Revealed!
Not gonna lie... the thumbnail of the zombie polar bear shit looks like Rap Monster😂👀
Youre not a bear, your name is Toby
literally nobody gave a shit about the zombie polar bear and you guys are still trying to hype it up... waste of budget :(
This reminds me of Ralph the movie maker
DnD just seem like idiots, mostly all the fanbase want ghost to have a more prominent role but no, ZOMBIE POLAR BEAR COS WERE IDIOTS WHO LIKE SEEING SPLOSIONS AND FOIRE
They wasted an episode worth of money on a fucking bear.
FUCK THE ZOMBIE POLAR BEAR!!! THE CGI MONEY COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO BRING BACK GHOST!!!! I WANT GHOST!!!!
Fuck your bear and suck my dick.
You guys whine more than 13 year old girls
honestly such a waste of budget
No more shirts and trousers and jackets? RLY?!\nThank You! Thank You from the bottom of my heart!
I didn't even know the bear was a zombie until right now, thought it was just a strange Westeros beast (which anyway it was) now I don't know if I should feel dumb or if I should just blame the directing because this episode must be the most unfocused of the series (like with the bunch of characters dying that weren't even shown before their deaths)
Can someone address why Kit always has white gunk in his hair in those interview scenes? lol
Your name is Toby ! :)
can't believe Thoros died for this shit
I don't think any of you really like Ghost, you are only here to use him to feel cool and accepted on the internet. No offense to people who really do like him
Behind the scenes on how to waste budget
i was very disappointed with this season, i was hoping that the 7th season was going to be the season we were finally going to see Arya in a very graphic sex scene, and seeing her coming across all those Lannister soldiers thought that, that might of been the moment where it was going to happen.
Damn if only all the effort that went into animating the CGI bear went into the actual writing.....
A zombie polar bear? How is this related to, let's say, dragons and all that from ancient history?
as soon as they deviated from the novel I instantly lost all interest
What do you people want Ghost to do? I wants Ghost for what? Just to walk around? Only few episodes left I rather see the main struggle and such than a diré wolf. Wait for rr to write about Ghost.
I guess they dont film everything on location
Guys, the zombie polar bear wasn't just for the theatrics, it was to give a hint to the audience that animals too can be turned into wights, foreshadowing what happened with Viserion.
Smh guess I'll watch the episode again!
Any one else think that in season 8, bran is going to tell Jon about how the night king was created and Jon is going to order them to  make him into one in order to stop the NK. Jon will do anything to stop the night king, and if that means giving up his life to save his family and westeros, he'll do it. I don't know what will happen to daenerys but she's for sure going to die some way.
Twd should do something like this a zombie animal
all that effort for something so fucking unnessary
Should have used the money on writing!
What a fucking shitty scene that nobody wanted.
It was pretty weird, to be honest. -Rory McCann and many GoT fans
Common sense: Why don't you do Ice Spiders as big as hounds? The things that have had multiple mentions throughout the show.\n\nD&D: Nah, just do a random fucking polar bear.
so the polar bear was idubbbz
That polar bear is taking revenge for REVENANT
bear was unnecessary, Where's Ghost? :K
this scene was so confusing to watch honestly I couldn't really follow it the first time I saw the episode I didn't know what was going on
Why are these mini documentaries behind a paywall?? Just upload it to YouTube for fucks sake.
Funny how much they hype this bear but nobody watching really gave a shit
GoT was my favourite show ever and this season ruined it. Thanks to the lazy writing, plot holes and general stupidity and carelessness of DnD. Ruining something so good takes a special kind of stupidity. And you guys proved to have it in spades.
Game of thrones is fucking gay
I think that title needs more grammatical errors
That's right. I stabbed it on the head while it's on fire
And, yet, it would get the shit kicked out of it by a zombie gorilla
It was the blurst of times.
Head too welove_gameofthrones on Instagram to receive funny memes and theories on game of thrones and it's upcoming season 8 🐺🔥❄️
One of the worst parts of the worst episode of last season. Great use of money guys.
Is that a remix of lollipop.
Why do people think ghost is dead, if we've learned one thing from game of thrones it is that you have to see something die before you know it's dead, and we haven't seen ghost die. Last we saw him was when jon was brought back to life
People watch this still?
So they swapped Ghost for a\n\n\nMotherfucking corpse of a polar bear?
These scene was very memorable, because that bear was truly terrifying! Cheers HBO one of my favorite moments of Season 7!
Dont get me wrong, i love GoT. But how the fuck is a video with 100k views and 3.5k likes is on trending again?
I really enjoyed season 7 overall, but a zombie polar bear sounds a lot more interesting on paper than it actually is to watch. By far the biggest moment of man, what happened to this show? I experienced in any of the seven episodes.
that polar bear scene was a waste of money and time in my opinion
Or pay your writers more?
Thanks, HBO! From occupied Russia.
Waste. Of. Budget. (HBO)
This saddens me...
or or or MAN BEAR PIG
basically, we're all effed

Any critics of Game of Thrones now; I suggest you go write something 10+Million people are watching , stealing to watch, buying series of the books, making multiple You Tube channels on the topics of the HBO series just about what you write. TRY IT ! I bloody bet nothing you sprawl out will equal half of the people Loving or even just mildly curious how its all going to turn out that watch Game of Thrones . Game of Thrones is not what it once was but it is not a regular t.v. series ....it has to come to an ending ; Game of Thrones has broken t.v. history records . The series is Lovingly and excitedly talked about on talk shows.... even when the series is off season and no one from Game of Thrones is scheduled to be on their talk shows. It wasn't up for any EMMY'S this year due to timing of Game of Thrones being later in the year as usual ; the series was given a Thank You by Stephen for giving other t.v. series a chance and as well as the series being mentioned in the beginning of the EMMY'S song introduction it was mentioned a few more times in praise . The nay sayers of Game of Thrones have no sense of imagination to be taken on someone elses journey and not their own ;they want what they like and anything different is off setting ....Game of Thrones is not their journey of story telling and imagination.  They have their own and one day maybe they will write it .
I've never seen this show in my life, is it good?
Chester has always been a role model for me and it's crazy that's he's gone now... I'm so proud of him. He inspired me and showed me the way. He was one of the main reasons I started rapping, Thank you Chester. P.s..If you guys got a minute, check out the music on my channel.I promise you won't be disappointed.
come on guys lets make this the most watched LP video ever
1:23 how can someone say a sentence like that so smugly snooty into a camera like she was making a duckface selfie. And then this little smile at the end... why even putting her in the video?
Good god. Its still so damn hard knowing that linkin park wont be the same anymore. Trying to listen again tears away at me. 😖.
It's so hard to believe that in one moment it could all end. I grew up with 5 older siblings, all whom were teens during the early 2000's-2010. During this time is when rock music was at its height and everyone knew Linkin Park, Green Day and more. I grew up listening to these bands and songs and honestly, I thank my siblings for that. I always joke around and say that I was destined to be emo because at the age of 8 I knew all the lyrics to Green Day's Boulevard of Broken Dreams, and honestly I'm proud of that. Now, I'm 13 and all my siblings are now adults and I thank them so much for non-stop playing 2000's songs in the car and at home when I was younger and introducing me to some of the greatest music there is out there. Now, I listen to the same bands my siblings did when they where my age and more (MCR, P!ATD, FOB), although I can say they never dug as deep as I did and didn't become obsessed with bands like My Chemical Romance. Being the youngest of 6 of course I was destined to be the odd one and be full on emo as you might say. Of course they think I'm odd for listening to music that's older than me by several years, or to music that screams a lot, but honestly I'm proud of it. In the car when one of these old song comes on I know it and my siblings and I jam out to it together. So once again thanks to my older siblings for showing me the good music.
love and sad about it 😢
This is beautiful people care about this linkin park so r.i.p linkin park
The tears always just keep flooding out. Chester was my inspiration for why I started singing every word that left his mouth had his heart and soul in it. R.I.P Chester you will be forever missed!

Like Steve aoki said if you are going to listen to linkin park listen to it fucking loud, sing it fucking loud, and play it fucking loud rip chester you impacted the world with your beautiful music and helped many people from that deep dark hole of depression, sadness, and etc. Rock in paradise I may have not met you in person but just know you are my insporation and you felt like a friend ROCK IN PARADISE! 🤘

Im a paranoid schizophrenic, diagnosed from age 15 I hand no real youth ive been through nine nasty hospitalization, ive been abandoned by my friends and my one biggest love is not with me right now. I was thinking of suicide as well amd I imagina that one day I shall commit one, because this world is not for me Ive made too many mistakes and suffered to much heartach and pain and lonliness. And sometimes I feel like a disgrace to my family but until Ill commit one I will try to manage by myself, the few new friends Ive picked along the way, and my dog. Ive wasted 17 years of my life, with those drugs and hope to find real love one day or even better bring back my amazing exgirlfriend who doesnt want me anymore and marry her
And the tears are falling again. :'(
Saw the post about it
Heard this song for the first time this afternoon and later this night a poor man in the uni block next to me overdosed. Wish he'd heard this in the afternoon just like me so he knew someone was always there for him, Rest in Peace my man, never knew you too well but I should have :)
This song always makes me cry. Such a well made vid. Rest In Peace Chester, we all love you ❤️

How cares if one more light goes out?, in a sky of a million stars...\n Linkin Park for ever... <3
I've experienced a lot of death in my short life, and even though I didn't know him in person, Chester's death has affected me more than I could ever imagine. I can't imagine what you guys are going through but I just want to say that you and Chester's music have saved my life on more than once occasion and for that I say thank you. Thank you for your honesty, compassion, integrity and for introducing me to a world of rock and metal that may have never happened otherwise in my early teens. Thank you and my biggest condolences, you have done more for your fanbase than you can possible imagine.
I wish I knew of this 😔
BUT LINCOLN PARK IS DEAD
It’s so sad that people have it so hard that people have to take their life’s

But is math related to science? *Thinking *
This guy is an idiot tho
A video is excellent by itself, but fire the guy who did editing on this video... That camera jumping back and forth is just annoying and doesn't have any reason to be there... And that short burst of music for each question... Again, no reason for it to be there...
Ok Dr. Tyson, who would win in a fight, Jaime with two hands or the Mountain? Please share your thoughts.
What was the significance of that recent electron discovered by the CERN Large Hadron Collider?
Too bad this isn't like 3 hours long.
Why does everyone think just cause this person has a social tag (astrophysicist) just cause he has that tag why does everyone think he knows everything about space, didnt the pope during medieval times say if you pay the church you will goto heaven? Think freely and dont always listen to what you hear
make him react to rick and morty
I agree completely that science is reducing war.  The greatest number of Americans to die in a war was during the American Civil War, a war that was fought over a single resource, slave labor.  The Southern states believed they needed that resource at the time, but science has given us automation, efficiency, and countless other helpful replacements for that unethical labor practice.  War was fought over a resource back then that our modern technology has rendered pointless.  I'm all for giving science credit for stopping wars.
10:25 No Dr. Tyson that’s not cool, that warm. Doofus.
can y'all imagine if Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Bill Nye, Brian Cox, and Ben Shapiro were in charge of the world? No more ignorance and no more opressed snowflakes
Not only that he is absolutely right about everything but all NASA photos of planets are pear-shaped as Earth too...
Neil, how do we know the girl at 7:05 shares the same anatomy as us?   We haven't cut her open to find out.  ()_()
Can their be a battle of the brains between Tyson and bill nye
Is Math related to Science?
Annoys me that he looks so upset at some questions, physics should be described with a smile, just like anything else.
Across the universe is a beatles song from the let it be album turned into a musical
But... Is math related to science?
I don't get this...
Neil is a fucking annoying
The entire purpose of why we have science at all, in particular, the methods and tools of science is to de-code that which is true about nature that otherwise transcends your sensory perceptions.
It's actually quite saddening seeing all these people in the comments that truly don't believe in modern science. And to think that these people will likely procreate and pass on their beliefs to their children. It's all really sad.
Is Math Related To Science
Bringing science out of the lab and into the home.
It is weird to think about, but guns saved lives on the battlefield.
The Man with the Master Plan!!!!
why does lightning come down in bolts instead of waves?
I wonder how much he gets paid to say all this bullshit  🖕 fk all u hate commts 🖕
What was before the universe before anything I mean something has to start from something but at first there has to be something but it evrey starts from nothing I mean if you see a house let’s say that’s the universe it’s had to be built what was there before the universe aka the house I’m confused
Lol a monkey in a suit
When he put on those eclipse glasses..im gonna make that my wallpaper😂
*He makes me feel so small as a human!*
Do you believe in god? What do you think of the people who believes?
I was thinking about majoring in astronomy but I realized it's a bit of a black hole if you know what I mean.
Is math related to science ?
When he go and watch Across the Universe he will be very disappointed to find out that  is a film about horny teen getting high in the late 60s... probably the type of gang he avoided when he was a teen in the late 60s
If trump had a complete opposite ... this is him. For many obvious reason.
10:15 chick’s like “oh, science lesson? I’m out”
We search for itellegent life in the universe because there certinally isnt any here.
I looked this up because I didn't understand; Quarks are particles that make up parts of an atom (protons, neutrons, etc.)
Yes Neil, the thermometer is cool
we need Feliks Zemdegs, Mats Valk, and Kevin Hays to answer questions about speedcubing/Rubik's Cubes
did he misunderstand the last question or did I?
his tie explains this whole video.
I love this guy
He clearly see alot of people as stupid. Like some of those questions are answered with just common sense and critical thinking.
Is math related to science?
It baffles me how many comments on this video are insulting NDT and calling him an idiot/moron/actor. And it's even more baffling how these comments are getting likes and rising to the top. I find the thought of arguing against these opinions exhausting.
What is that thing he had at the end of the video, where do I buy it?
MAN I love that his tie
*_Is math related to science?_*
how do you calculate the goldylock if you cant know if the planet have global warming or a magnetic field, like mars and venus are in the goldylock zone but they are not habitable.
Is math related to science ?
Is Science related to Math?
Everybody likes Neil because everybody wants to be smart.
All gun deaths, not just homicide so no separation from suicide to homicide?
I listen to his podcast because his voice helps me fall asleep lol
These questions are pretty stupid. They should filter the good ones, otherwise it's a waste of time.
I need me a gravitational massage
Though the nuclear bomb was created through science so science killed many lives
Haven't found a habitable exoplanet yet? What's the deal with Trappist-1 then? Are they just potentially inhabitable?
4.38... wow punk rock ? or just illuminati ? here and there.
He needs to be my physics teacher
I love this man
DUUUDe i like neil that means i am a genius!
There is thousands of people in his field way smarter but hes black so he gets the glory. The hell with the others with Ph.D's in  physics from people who know much more. All he does is answer questions salved by others. My 1st grade teacher told me 2+2 is four.. I'm not the next genius. Notice he does not answer a single question from his own studies or findings, cause he has none.
I wonder if he every got a question that made him say this is a great question
Does Neil have a podcast?
They wrote dark matter is making the universe expand in the tweet response, but it's dark energy. Big difference, but dumb nitpick XD.
*Hits Blunt*\n\n\nWhat if aliens are just us from the future? In the year 9023 we discover time travel and we come back in time to visit our old planet. We leave crop fields and it's only for comedic purposes.
he explains things in such a cool way, i wish my teachers at school would had been like that
So let me try to understand, don't trust your senses let science tell you what's real because you don't have a clue. Luke just used the force on everybody....let God be true and every man a liar.
I have a question!!.\nDoes our sun have a twin?. and if it has, is it located somewhere out of sight like in the oort cloud?. \nI watched a documentary a long time ago on discovery? that linked this with the latest three mass extinctions. The sun's lost twin nudging meteorites towards earth. Is this true?
If life  extraterrestrial is nothing like it is here on earth, couldn't it survive without water.
You bastard Neil, I went to the book store and purchased your book when you were in Idaho, it was just a coincidence and the bookstore dude told me I just missed you and you were at the store. I know a little secret about you and you WILL let me buy you a drink next time you're here!
Yeah but the real question here is why does my leg hair turn into Velcro when I fap in the shower?
I’m an alien I think. I feel like I am an alien with a big alien penis
We have not found aliens all the ufos u are seeing is secret government tech
Most people don't like science. They like pothead science videos you watch when ur high on youtube.
He speaks the language of divine truth and equally ingnorance...IT'S OK to admit not just what we don't know, but to realize we may not even know what we don't know... no blind faith required since mostly based on math and physics.. and probability
Hes gotta cool tie
Fricken
SuuuuuuperNovaaaaaaa
love the tie.
nice tie
Are traps gay?
NDT my hero <3
Yo, Neil, you totally misread Nefellian's question!!!
Sick tie
Damn nigga u smart

The happiness I gained from watching the video was quickly drained away after reading all the dumb comments from the degenerate retards who think that he is a con artist and that NASA is lying about the Earth being round.
This comment section in particular is weird. There's an unusual amount of hate. Also, science denial, and flat earthers. Weeeeird.
That was Sunbeam, but shes delicate right now... Girl me too Sunbeam. Me fucking too

Hi Arden! (ohmygodyouaresocute) Love your video!
you’re so CUTE
why dont they include highlighters in the PR package? i have been combing websites n images n youtube for proper swatches of every single product n highlighters are missing!
i’m early!! hi arden , love you 💕
Love the music (very kickthepj-esque)!
Omg I didn't even know this was a thing 😍😍😍😍 s/o youuuu Arden!
I don't even wear make up but I had so much fun watching this!
I love the color in this
I will watch this over and over
I. Need. It. All.
Thank you Arden for this magical throw back into my childhood, all the yesss
It would be amazing if a company did a Barbie line like this, my inner child would die of happiness 💕
Sees My Little Pony in the title 😀\nSees it's about old generation 😲
you are my aesthetic. the set-up for this video was so bomb
I craved something sweet after i watch this video. Probably the color theme reminds me of candy jar
You need to find some more exciting ppl in your life makeup wise if you didn't think you'd know many ppl to wear that lip. :) \nLove your vids girl.
Wow I love this
oh girl I like this filming location and you in general but also the lighting
all the items for the collection are pretty reasonable too, I might actually look into the shadow!!!
So excited for this 💓
THE LOOK IS A WIN 😍
The nostalgia is Real!!!! I almost can't....!!!! 😩
Wish the shadow colors were more bright and matte 😔
The lips look great!!! You look so beautiful what the hell Arden
i mean listen... SHE'S PINK!!
Omg I spent the whole video trying to figure out if the posters in the back where from Firewatch and I was like probably not and then when Future Arden said I got you I just lost it. I loved that game
gregarious means sociable.... what does that have to do with the packaging lol
Love this!! You're so personable and like you, I was much more drawn toward Lisa Frank than My Little Pony. 
“I got you” hahahahahah
Haaaaa I adore the future Arden parts
Woohoo! Trending :-)))
I WANT EVERYTHING!!!
Love love love ur humor
my little pony stickers aaahhhhhh 🌈✨🌈✨🌈✨
Im one of those asshole hahaahaha aw arden

Genuinely love you Arden. Thanks for everything :)
MOMMY YOU'RE TRENDING!!!!
I love being politely served Jessica day vibes
If this was hello kitty, it would have been for you
ardennnnn where are ur earrings from? i need them in my life!!
where was your red lip gloss from?
I'm only watching this because I like hearing your voice and admiring your face.
um you're kind of a bitch lol
Does anyone know where she got the posters in the background?
That necklace is amazing, does anyone know where it's from?
In Singapore, we love to dip our fries to the hot fudge sundae. Quite similar
God korea what have you done...
I think I ever seen Simon and Martina's video about Mc'D cocholate fries in Japan
This reminds me of dipping chips into ice cream
I've been eating these fries every time I go to Mcdonalds in Korea since I came here for my exchange trip and I absolutely love them!
Could be inspired by Canadian poutine.
I knew that joel and dan were significantly fluent at korean but wow I didnt expect joel to improve his korean this much its really good to see all these englishmen progressing😊😊
But chips go well with mc donald's ice cream!
Does anyone else like dipping their fries in their milkshakes??? I love to do this but it's so unhealthy LOL.
When i see these guys, i think their are looks like weird
We have tomato sauce in that kind of packaging in Australia
Why does the Korean Big Mac actually look edible?!?!?!?!!!!!?????!!!!!
ㅋ
did joel just say hella? omg bay lingo is spreading so much
감자튀김은 맘스터치 ㅇㅈ?
감자튀김엔 하인즈 케찹이 짱임
ㅠㅠㅠ 뭐하는짓이에요....
김치초콜릿 있어요...
그야말로 단짠단짠
정말 이래도 되는 건가?
조니 보고싶어옹
I like to eat MacDonald's fries with the vanilla ice cream cone. 맛있어요!
누가 저런 끔찍한 혼종을...
**LOL**
치킨너겟에 왜 초콜렛을 뿌려먹냐 으엑

저거 먹고싶었는데,,
한국에 김치초콜렛 있는데...
김치쵸콜릿 있어욬
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ구ㅏ여워
we dip mcdonalds fries in chocolate hot fudge ice cream since i was a kid. well its a norm here in manila
We have packages like that in Australia and New Zealand for tomato ketchup. Very very common.
i always dip my fries in ice cream or condensed milk. its taste great. i dont think fries and choco is that weird
Don't you guys dip your french fries into ice cream? Isn't the taste just like that?\nTake the french fries, scoop or dip them in vanilla or chocolate ice cream and eat it. It's very good~\nWouldn't the taste of it be similar?
i think joel knows that all vanilla is beaver's anus juice.
7:24 김치초콜릿 있답니다!
오늘도 재밌는 영국남자!!진짜 재밌게 보고있어요!
7:25 김치초콜릿 팝니다 우리나라에.....

07:25 조쉬는 김치 초콜릿이 있는지 모르는가 봅니다..아마도 다음 시식은 초콜릿 김치가 되지 않을까.....
호오오호옥!!!! 항상 보고 망설였는데 꼭 먹어봐야겠네요!!! 이거 한정 메뉴인가요??? 정확히 알아봐야겠어요!!
단은 영어로 듣고 말은 한국말로 하네요 ㅋㅋ
0:58 아이엠 약간 무서워ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 귀여워요
전 이런 단짠조합 너무 좋아서 맛있게 먹었었는데....영상보니 또 먹고싶어졌어요ㅋㅋㅋ
솔찍히 감튀는 구토할정도는 아니던데\n근데 버거는 잘 모르겠다... 맛이 없을거같아
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 둘이 입맛이 반대네요 \n감자튀김까진 궁금했는데\n치킨너겟부턴... 읔
로이스초콜릿 사러가실때 로이스초콜릿감자칩 드셔보세요ㅎㅎ진짜 단짠단짠해서 맛있어요
둘이 의견 완전 switch 될때 짱웃겼음 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 단 표정 넘 웃겨
미안 나도 초콜렛은 아닌것 같아...다 맛없어.......\n차라리 케이에프씨처럼 쿠키같은걸 만들어주지...흐윽
ㄹㅇ 초콜렛 개좋아해서 먹어봤는데 기대이하임...
조엘 한국말 정말 많이 늘었네요!!
악마의 전염병같은맛ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
김치초콜릿 본거 같은데.....누가 이런 끔찍한 혼종을 만들었는가......
일본에는 동결건조 김치가 들어간 쵸콜릿을 팝니다...
인류에게는 너무 이른 음식이다.
더블초코후라이 진짜 핵존맛인데...개씹꿀맛
정말 놀라운 사실은 김치초콜릿이 진짜 있다는거죠.,..
비쥬얼이.. 생각한거랑은 다르네요
한국껀 아니지만 로이스 감자칩이있는데 그것도 초콜릿이 묻혀져있는 감자칩이에요! 꽤 맛있는뎅
음식가지고 장난치면 안되는데...
먹는걸로 장난치는거 아닌데 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
한국에 김치초콜렛 있습니다...김초콜릿 도 있구요...없긴 왜없어
제가 알기로 제주도에서 김치 초콜렛 파는 걸로 아는데...(...)\n\n그냥 뭐든지 초고를 끼얹어보고 싶은 사람이 있는게 아닐까 싶습니다
ㅈ같은 맥도날드^^ 와플 후라이 시켰는데 감튀가 나오길래;;.. 직원한테 이게 뭐에여..?...??, 주문하신거요(띠꺼움;;), 제가 시킨건 더블 초코 와플 후라이인데요?, (띠꺼운말투+짜증섞임) 원래 그건데요? ㅡㅡ;;, 아.. 네..ㅡㅡ;; 하고 나와서 친구들이랑 존나 욕하면서 사진찍고 먹음;; 맥도날드 위치는 삼성역 맥도날드 입니다.
아냐 저 감자튀김은 갈비쥐야 갈비쥐
조엘 개웃기네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
로이스에서 파는 초코감자칩 진짜 맛있는데 먹어봐요!! 두툼한 감자칩과자에 한면이 초코렛 입혀져있는데 단짠단짠이 환상적인 맛이에요 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 여행갔다오면 면세점에서 꼭 사오는!!ㅋㅋㅋ
으어..초콜릿을 밥에 비벼먹는 느낌 같다. 으엌
난 저거 맛없을거같아서 안사는데
맛없을것같아요 ㅠㅡㅠ 미안해요 맥날
작년인가? 일본 맥도날드에 겨울 한정으로 나왔던 메뉴였어요!

여러분들 Jtbc Tv채널에\n영국남자가 나와여~!!
초코감자튀김 바닐라아이스크림에 찍어먹으면 진짜 개꿀맛😍\n단짠 조합 좋아하면 진짜 맛있을거에요👍😭 오늘도 영상 재밌게 봤어요!🙏
영상관련 댓인 아니지만 갑자기 생각나서 가장 최근 글에 남겨요! 한국 오시면 한국민속촌에서 이놈아저씨(벨튀체험)랑 작명 받으시면 좋을 것 같아요!!!! 체험만 해도 꿀잼 영상 나올 것 같아요😍
맥도날드에서 아이스크림이랑 감자튀김 사서 감자튀김 아이스크림에 찍어 먹으면 맛있던데 나만 그러나...
조쉬도 어깨 넓은편인데 양쪽애들은 얼마나넓은거여
조엘 너무 오바하는거 같음
먹기싫으면 시도하질말지 구역질까지 하는건 좀 보기안좋네요 선입견생기게
조쉬형 혹시 우리나라 가수중에 유명한 가수들의 노래를 친구들이나 외국인들에게 들랴줘보는건 어떨까요? 예능프로그램 복면가왕에 나와서 엄청 인기를 끌었던 하현우가 리메이크한 매일매일기다려같은거요. ㅎㅎ
초코가 서양음식이라 생각안해봤는데 이때까지 아프리카에서 만들어진 음식이라 생각했는데.. 생각해보닌깐 아프리카도 서양이잖엉??? 와우
조쉬 😅 중국에가서 여행   하는거 찍으시는영상찍어주세요.😣
r we just ignore Andrew's last name like what the fuck
So glad y'all put the slow motion on the last one that worth it is known for.👌👌
The cinnamon roll Adam Spoke!  Not to be rude, Adam's cinematography / editing ...not this ep. THat said LOVE the collab
Ya boy Shaun comin' in looking like doctor evil with that shirt.
Fat it important for the texture of meat not the flavor. If the fat was so great you could just cook all meat in the 1kg of fat and result would be the best meat in the world.
Oh snap my favorite YouTubers in one video. All it's missing is papa bless
THESE dudes produce compelling content on their own channel? They must've been off their game here, because they're about as interesting as a pile of wet paper towels.
aged meat is so wrong
getting dr. evil vibe from sean.  1 billion dollars
*AHEM* boy needs to clear his throat big time.
Adam sounds different than I thought
Goddamn, why dont you just eat the fucking meat raw?
I'd gladly take a whack at.....and from that tomahawk steak.
I didn't know what Adam's voice sounded like until now
They carved the T bone out of the T bone?  LOL = SHIT!
Anyone else triggered by collared shirts with the top button buttoned with no tie?
Adam is 100% the unsung hero of the worth it episodes. glad he was included!
Sean, what's with these fools? Why are they obsessed with sharing single portions of steak? The 40 oz of steak, sure, two people, on a date, yeah, sure, maybe. But... 4 people for a whole steak? Get outta here.
Why do they get gay guys to do this?
First time I heard Adam's voice
Josh sent a hug to my mouth, with this meat I guess. Beautiful description.
I thought that was Ryland Adams on the thumbnail...
It's never worth it unless you just wanna show off how much money you want to waste. Cooking steak at home is extremely easy.
Wasn't he talking shit about buzzfeed in one of his videos?
This is the first time I've ever heard Adam actually say more than a few words.
Adam looks like a kid who snuck some cookies and now his parents are asking where they went.
Finally we can hear Adam’s beautiful voice😁😁😁
These guys seem like pretentious snobs. Definitely don't have these guys on hot ones. Except maybe the camera man. He seems cool
Yep, the ribeye is the best. People who are afraid of fat made the fillet popular
Something I learned very quickly about NYC. You can get anything found in NYC just about anywhere for less.
This literally combined my two favorite YouTube shows these days.
Adam is the man!!
You are what buzzfeed wishes it could be
So are they all eating cold or warmed up steaks basically and trying to tell the difference? That's a bit ridiculous, you have to taste it like ~5 minutes from the pan, otherwise it's just raw meat again.
The way sean holds his fork at 5:01 really disturbs me
As a fan of Shawn and Worth It, this was a smart duo! Love you guys!
This is not the guy I would want cooking a steak. Pasta, ok, pizza, ok. Steak with olive oil(low burn temp) and herbs before grilling? No thanks.
They should join First We Feast and make a 'Why I left Buzzfeed' video
Sad about Sean Evans fork and knife skills. Would expect more from him :(
I wonder it they get to deduct their food expenses on their taxes
Sean Evans quickly becoming one of my favorite celebrity interview personalities. Love your shows guys!
Get Desus and Mero on hot ones!
So that's what Adam sounds like?
I didn't know Adam could even talk :O
2:38 Steven looked so sad that Andrew just went ahead with that bite without doing a cheers with him
i want idubbbz on hot ones please.
these guys need to get the fuck out of buzzfeed and just do their own thing.
The chef's voice is so raspy he sounds like he's been gargling with my pussy juice
Where’s the parsley?
I had never heard Adam voice like that
i could watch steak video's all day
Clickbait thumbnail, Adam is in the video. Flagging for false advertising! 🙄
If I order it well done with ketchup, will the chef kill me and serve me for dinner?
Adams first sentence was more words than the past three seasons.
Steven wouldn't last long on Hot Ones xD
Content Cop : BuzzFeed Worth It Guys
that asian is fucking baked
Needs more HOT!
youtube juggernauts
You guys got played !!!
Sean looks like dr evil
IS IT WORTH IT
Woooooooooo Ric flair
andrew whatthefuckisthatlastname
Adam! Adam! Yes ☺😘
10/10 weirdest crossover episode
Adam can talk? Whoa!
Sick... buzzfeed... yay... 😒
Adam should start a vlog
Steven is so fucking annoying
YOOO ADAM SOUNDS DIFFERENT MAN!
This is awesome
Nice try, Agent 47.
Chef needs to hock that luggie out...lol
Gross.
everyone getting on that Steven Lim bandwagon
Wow theyve both made it
Flavorless meat...yay -_-
top 10 anime crossovers
MOAR COLLABS
*the conc??*
Why
Hot ones with brandon Rogers plz👍
Nice shirt Adam!
These guys were boring
Adam
Killer ... Dope collab
Fuck I'm hungry...
$5 heart attack, $20 heart attack, or $300 heart attack?
Dude, unbutton the pollo.
Dang Adam calm down
does anyone know the denim jacket steven was wearing
I want to see these millennial shitbags actually FUCKING COOK something instead of talking HORSEDUNG on Buzzshit's credit card...
I can't stand Sean's American pronunciation lmao
Chateaubriand is the best. Anyone who's had a good Chateaubriand knows what's up.
Wait is Adam actually gay? I didn't realize until now
why are all my food guys coming together!?  Stay out of my head!
This video clip includes massive procedures.Do a search for: rubixcube magxxx in google.
Adam can talk louder than a whisper? wat
Have pchyhedsubstense on ur show
Really trending........really?
Surely he felt the breeze
he did it for harambe
Rock out - with your cock out!
He’s going balls to the wall
felt so uncomfortable watching that especially on the final stretch. poor Jozef
How does that even happen! He should be wearing trunks or skins!!
Y is this in trending
He was busting his balls to get across the finish line.
If this vid was of a chick with her vag out it would get taken down IMMEDIATELY...
Shit number three on trending this guy will never see anyone ever again without them saying hey flap sack
i like the little giggles and snickers the filmer makes :D
The man is showing his brain
Wow I don't have the balls to do what he did.
Ancient Greeks did the Olympics in the nude...
How low are his ball or was he wearing underwear
How did he not notice
He pp\n\nGot me like L diSiehan
Balls to the walls
Why would he not wear underwear or compression shorts? Wouldn't it be painful/annoying/noisy having his genitals flapping about like that?
Not a single person reacted
Grab life by the balls!!
Pretty big knob aye I'd rep that thing with pride too
Will dicks out for harambe was like a year ago but better late then never
He will be a good soccer player
Well...i can't help by saying it_ not a bad package!😁😁😅\nP.S. I am a pervert 🙈
How the fuck is this on YouTube???
Get your ball bras here. Ball bras. A cup for your ball and a cup for the other one. A buck for the pair.
As a woman I have always felt boobs suck for running,  but man junk looks far harder to deal with!
Might as well win something for the cameras
RIP too all those little kids virgin eyes 😭😭😂😂
I think ever human should be naked. Screw clothes!
At least he had the balls to do a marathon.
What the actualy fuck. HOW DO YOU NOT NOTICE YOUR DICK HANGING OUT!
It was a photo finish ;)
You have to admire his balls.
This man be balling like a boss
Most people win by a nose!  He just HAD to be different!
It took some big balls for that man to finish that race. Literally.
How is this on YouTube
This is number 3 on trending
Bruised and sunburnt ballz! Good job on the marathon though!
That sound wasn't applause it was his nuts hitting his knees...
I feel sorry for the guy
poetry in motion. find your rhythm and feel the burn (factor 50 may help here).
Dominik Cvik, how you kept it together at 0:22 was good but after 0:29 is unbelievable! I would've completely ruined the video.
i know Europe doesn't have the same EEEKK!!!  towards nudity and stuff but how did they not notice/change away
Hahaha omg how did he not notice that his dick and balls were out lol
I like how barley anyone notices and no one says anything
1:18 that cameraman on the left saw the perfect opportunity.
That was some good running man. Nice!
how the hell is this video not taken down yet
But where's Julian and Oney???
That was so weird!
Well, at least he reached the penis line.
lol that first moment when bicycle rider dude notices his balls out and quickly turns his head and just keeps on riding fast to save his back :P
Yes!!!  He's a weiner!
Girl: You should come over\nBoy: But you live so far away\nGirl: My parent aren’t home\nBoy:
Come on guys he was just airing out
No undies lemme guess??😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂REPLIE YOUR FORTH MOST USED EMOJIE AND THATS WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THIS VIDEO
It was a stiff competition, but he won by a few inches.
How was no one like “excuse me sir your cock and balls are out”?
Lol guess who just killed all his babies...
That's nothing new to me, just another day in the life of a dude that's hung like a jury
After watching this video, my most embarrassing memory doesn’t seem that bad anymore... XD
First thing that crosses my mind is how is this allowd on YouTube
Well he's sure committed, isn't he?
He looked like he was balling his eyes and balls out!
these are the kind of videos that deserve to be in trending...lol
Воды даже не дали в конце ужас!!!
Good job ding dong
put your briefs on.. so windy
Balls Of Steel.
Always need some fresh air! Grat!
😄😅😂
Poor guy
Fasza kis futás lehetett!!! 😂

Ich hätte sie gerne , weil ich noch nie die Möglichkeit hatte ins Fußballstadion zu fahren ...😳
Ik wil heel graag die schoenen winnen wand ik ben al echt van me 4 al Ronaldo fan
echt cool ronaldo je hebt een voetbal veld in je tuin
Ik wil graag winnen want touzani heeft meer skills dan ronaldo en ik voetbal mn hele leven al
ik wil deze schoenen omdat ik  heel graag profvoetballer wil worden en ik hou van voetbal en ik wil stoer doen met deze schoenen maar ik weet ik ga niet krijgen (zoals altijd) maar ik kan het tenminste proberen :)
Ik wil die schoenen graag omdat ik binnenkort weer ga beginnen met voetballen maar niet genoeg geld heb voor schoenen.❤ naar jou touzani
Ik zou graag deze schoenen een mooi plaatsje geven, Cristiano Ronaldo is al jaren mijn grote voorbeeld en ik volg elke wedstrijd van C. Ronaldo. Het zou geweldig zijn om zijn gesigneerde schoenen in bezit te hebben. De beste voetballer van de wereld. Door omstandigheden kan ik zelf niet meer voetballen dus kan ze niet aan trekken. Top video ook weer Souf!
Omdat ik gwn van jullie hou en hele grote fan ben van jullie
ik wil wel winnen ik vindt die schoenen wel mooi en dan kan ik ze ergens neerleggen in mijn huis het zou wel tof zijn als ik die CR7 Ronaldo schoenen zou winnen  en Ronaldo is mijn lievelingsvoetballer ps als je mij wilt contacteren zeg het dan via een video want ik kijk je video toch altijd
Touzani laat Ronaldo ff zien wat onze Nederlandse kampioen kan
lijp man langs gaan bij de beste voetballer op dit moment 😎 die schoenen winnen heel erg graag ! Maar dat zal nog knap lastig worden met al die reacties van andere haha
ik zou graag die schoenen willen mijn beste vriend is de grooste fan van ronaldo en het is mijn buurman dus dan kunnen we er samen van genieten en #ronnaldo is gewoon een baas
Ik wil die schoenen wel echt graag hebben en wrm omdat ze gwn echt gaaf zijn en vooral met die handtekening en omdat jij ze hebt gedragen. Voor als je het nodig hebt ofzo insta: _jelle_045
Ik hou van voetbal darrom
Holt shit dit had ik echt nooit verwacht die schoenen zou ik echt super graag willen winnen ( ik ben al jaren fan van Ronaldo en ook van jou)
De schoen zouden perfect staan onder het shirt van CR7 die op mijn kamer aan de muur hangt 👌🏻⚽️
Ik ben zijn grootste fan
Ik wil die schoen winnen omdat ik ouwe schoenn heb
Omdat Ronaldo de beste is
Ik vind die schoenen erg mooi en ik zou graag die schoenen willen
Het zou supervet zijn om deze schoenen te winnen, ben al jaren van van jou en Ronaldo. Keek ook altijd al naar zapp sport met jou. Zou het niet geloven als ik ze schoenen win
wat is dit erg onverwacht, van favoriete voetbal youtuber naar een goeie gozer die gaat stoppen :( het ga je goed touzani, we zullen je missen! 15 jaar bezig geweest en je hebt het bereikt, succes topper!
Ik wil hem winnen omdat Ronaldo een beast is en hij een groot voorbeeld voor mij is en ik denk voor heel veel voetballers op de wereld
Ik heb niet echt een echte reden waarom maar zou ze super graag willen en weet zeker dat ik beter ermee zal worden!
Omdat het gewoon super cool is om bij de beste voetballer thuis te zijn en een super coole video
Ronaldo is echt mijn held Mijn eerste Voetbaltraining Had ik een Ronaldo shirt aan en nu kan ik schoenen winnen Echt asjeblieft mag ik die schoenen!
Zag ik op 5:25 nou een kind
broer die schoenen zijn  ziek ik zou ze graag willen omdat mijn broer bijna jarig en dan geven als verjaardag cadeau hij is heel erg dan van Ronaldo daarom zou ik ze willen winnen <3
Ik zou de kicksen graag willen winnen omdat ik eigenlijk wel toe ben aan nieuwe voetbalschoenen. En met de extra touch van Christiano Ronaldo zullen er zeker wat goaltjes extra bij in gaan👍🏻
Toen ik jong was keek ik elke dag naar je befaamde freestyle filmpje van Dj Mummy - Nuttin no go so!\nChristiano is degene die het dichtstbij komt met het toepassen van dat soort skills in echte wedstrijden!! \nDaarom zou ik die schoenen graag winnen, ben fan van jullie beiden, al jaren!

Horrific...when the music stopped couldnt they have warned the people...what an awful tragedy on innocent people.....deepest condolences to all who have suffered
Hmmm Are we already in Hell?
Time just ended a video of a mass shooting telling me to sub? Holy shit
Body armor is gonna gonna be the new fashion
HEY TIME !! YOU KNOW WHAT'S COMING NEXT -- RIGHT ?? THE VIDEO OF THE 2ND SHOOTER ON THE 4TH FLOOR -- AS CONFIRMED BY THE LVPD DISPATCHER. DON'T EVEN TRY IT -- OK ??
Sounds like the OTrauma and The Dump Administration are not doing anything on those Gun Laws!
the panic in their voices...
Hey everyone don't get mind tricked by the elite group they want us to lose
obviously the two shooters in mandalay bay hotel were distractions. there's no way they could inflict that much damage; wound 500, & kill 57 from 400 yards in the dark at an almost impossible angle shooting down with sniper precision wake up people!!!!!!!!!!!! To me, and this my opinion that second  flurrie was return fire. but here's  the real this probably the most surveyed city in the world meaning cameras are running and recording 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 a year 10 years a decade. To me the real question is where's  the footage and what about the other shooters at the other hotels?\n\n\nAnyone who was really there or has footage that hasent been edited get at me  \nthere may be some money for u.\n\n\n\nfatboi3025@gmail.com
So sad 😭what kinda a world we are living right now huh ??? Can't even felt safe anymore these days don't know what the heck will be happens next 😢
But not all the light..... red light ok
Aldean had a responsibility to warn his audience of the gunfire and to take cover  before running for cover himself.
Leave it to TIME to leave a subscribe reminder at the end of this horrifying video.. classy folks, real classy
Why tf would you get down? Like do u want to die?
You would think that someone would get on the mic and say people need to exit or something. Because it took a while before people realized what was going on.
WHY DIDNT THE SINGER SAY RUN OR GET DOWN. HE JUST RAN OFF ONLY CARING ABOUT HIMSELF
No idea whatsoever who this Aldean fellow is, or why anyone would want to watch him on stage, but to each his own, I guess. Also, seeing as this is a false flag op, isn't he in on it as well? Pretty cowardly how no one in charge gave any direction whatsoever.
this is bullshit......if a gunman sprayed a crowd, where are the casualties? The band leaves and nobody does anything because nobody was shot. If people were being shot down, there would have been way more panic and way more screaming as people died.
Wish trump was in this crowd and hit
I hear tickets are on sale now for the next country music festival feauturing jason aldean wearing a jogger suit and running shoes (poor Jason almost tripped last time running in boots)
Problem is noone knows what actual gunfire sounds like.  People, it sounds like fireworks from afar, you get that cracking sound the closer the bullet is to you.  These days, DUCK AND FUCKING COVER, then locate the source and evac.  Arg, im so mad..   fucking asshole.
My question is why they turn the lights on so the shooter can have a clean look?
He really give him self for free will to Evil Hell sick man 😠😠
MY QUESTION IS WHY DID THE LIGHTS GO ON?????????????
This guy Aldean is a coward in my eyes. He gave no warning, no hint or clue as to what was happening or why he ran; he just left... kinda like to say, screw this and screw you guys... I'm out...! Boycott his country ass...!
Oh my God!!!!! What can I say, I am just so heart broken and in deep pain and thoughts how people can be so evil to perpetrate such heinous act. I can't even watch the video and my heart is so bitter and heavy for  innocent children who now have to live the rest of their lives without parent. OMG!!!!!! My heartfelt condolences to all the bereaved. May the almighty comfort them and keep them safe.
My sympathy to all victims and their families  from iran
Holy f.ck I didn't know it was a full auto assault rifle
ban all guns, america would be a lot safer place 100% guaranteed or your money back
This is not what Jason wants to be remembered for omg
This is part of American culture it’s nothing new, it is sad that good people lost their lives.
To any Americans offering thoughts and prayers: if you actually care, do something about your gun laws.
He has a mic, realizes what's going on and never once uses it to yell RUN, before exiting???????????? hmmmm.....
Why in the eff did they turn that stage light on? What the mother f**k?
THIS STUFF HAS TO STOP!!! so disturbing .......
This is tragic but why would anyone pay money to watch such a boring musician perform, or was it free?
Why did the stage crew turn the bright lights on the crowd?
I get Goosebumps when I hear the guy say  oh ho!
The graphics is amazing .-. I can't see a thing :(
I wonder if the bump-stock salesmen feel proud today.
Don't worry. We'll keep telling ourselves guns aren't the problem and not a goddamn thing will change. And that's exactly what we're going to say the next time this happens, as it will, within a few weeks or months.
.shooter worked at lockheed martin? the missile bomb place?.
I bet hollywood is gonna make some money out of this tragic event.
Why wasn't an announcement made?!?!?!?
Where's the close up? Bait!
Damn im glad he shot himself afterwards. We dont need ppl like him in our country.\n\n\n*Praying For The Loss Of Loved Ones And Injured*\nThey r in a better place now.\nThey will be loved by many.\nRest in piece❤
why would someone do this ?
Should have shouted to his fans ,shots have been fired
This is very disturbing it amazes me how the lack of human was in this both the shoter and the lack of concern the members of that whole band have for the poor people who didnt have a clue what was going on while jason and his band was thucked safely away than to text hes ok and the bands ok you want to see to devil hes wearing a cowboy hate with alot of money hungry demands around him leading people to nasty drunkenness aldultry blasphemy lovers of self more than God nabor or any one else please wake up and repent the time is near look around you see the signs tv nasty discussing programs gamers your kids worship starwas harry potter lord of the rings nothing but evil in this world it gonna end soon turn stop following them fake preachers singers movie stars they are gonna take you and your family to hell its real repeat
he ran like a little bitch
20,000 phones and only one used to record was a 1998 flip phone wtf
I fucking hate the guy who did this
A millionaire with a million rounds!!
Why..\n\nGun should be banned 😡
Get down stay down hit u wit the beretta u betta lay down stray shots from the playground
I have been to Las Vegas at least 5 times, in my lifetime, so far....I can't understand how he was able to bypass security & have all those guns with him in his room....Vegas is very highly secured, or it was supposed to be, in their hotels and casinos....I guess security is losing people, not sure....
Did the performer just run off stage without warning the crowd? Seriously ?
My heart is aching, I can’t believe this.
To deploy the worst defence possible.\n1. Warn no one, even though you have a mic, ability, and time to do so.\n2. Turn on flood lights to help hide the shooter, and light the target area for the shooter.\nYou would think concert security would have some basic warning criteria in case of a shooting. How many people stood around or remained stationary unaware of what was happening or what to do.
I don't know why I watched this :(
I couldn't imagine the horror these people felt. My condolences to those who lost loved one's in this tragedy.
fake news.. multiple shooters.... same sketchy shit as the Aurora shooting... we will never know the real story
Why is there no public database that tracks how many guns and bullets a person buys using his permit, and automatically sends this data to the police? Surely we have the technology to do this -- I mean, they keep track of how many Taylor Swift cds are scanned at every register, and instantly notify Billboard magazine in time for next week's chart (using SoundScan). Well, is this not more important? I understand that the National Tracing Center tries to do this using paperwork, but they're too slow and backlogged to be of any use. We need something electronic and instant.
life's might have been saved.
Can someone supply times of people actually gettinf shot
Where did the whole clip go If he didn't hit anyone??
If you don't identify the problem how are you supposed to fix it? Stop refering to it as Evil and refer to it as islamic terrorism  because that is what it is.
I guess the shooter didn't like country music.
Boy oh boy, that video showed me.......nothing at all.  Can I have those 2 minutes back, plz.
This man is terrorising the place and people. He should be clearly labelled as a terrorist instead of mentally disturbed white man. He does not have to be part of a terrorist organization. Himself is an organization. If we dont punish mentally disturbed people we would see more of this from white people. If it was a colored person he would've been labelled as a terrorist instantly. Let's make America Great again my ass Trump.
Wonder why our politicians think it's ok for the general public to own automatic weapons.
Don't believe the Jew news, another Mossad operation like all the others / wake up America
Notice no one mentioned his religion. But what if he was called mohammed?!
Why is this a 'mass shooting' and not a terrorist attack.
This gives me the chills. What an awful tragedy
30,000 people sang god bless America at this concert and look what happened. That's pretty sad.
So.... What part was graphic?
An american terrorist
Americans killing Americans.
That's disturbing
watch my video you wont regret
COWARD. About as brave as Dan Bilzerian.
OMG
#VegasStrong #GodBlessAmerica #VegasStongerTogether #MakeAmeriicaGreat

WHITE AMERICAN
Sad
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR9AsdWg73E Watch it
On Sunday's NPR Radio broadcast, they talked about British Foreign Minister Johnson reciting Kipling's poem, 'The road to Mandalay', during his visit to Myanmar dignitaries, saying it was a 'faux pas'. They followed it up with Frank Sinatra's full version of On the Road to Mandalay!   While I watched the Mandalay Bay shooting unfolding that night, I thought how bizarre is that! Coincidence? Omen?\n\nAlso, CEO of MGM that owns Mandalay Bay, Jim Murren,  has interesting political ideologies. Big Anti-Trump, self-proclaimed anti white supremacist, and supports various left wing groups like the Council of Islamic Relations. Regarding the two latter and issued months ago: \n\n“While hate mongers and white supremacists have a constitutional right to express their views, we must stand strongly in defiance of violence, bigotry and anything that threatens our precious right to equality. You have my commitment that we will vigorously and zealously continue to reject hate speech and hate-based actions in any form.”\n\nTo express this commitment, Murren said, MGM Resorts will match employees’ donations to the Southern Poverty Law Center, NAACP, Anti-defamation League, Human Rights Campaign, Council on American Islamic Relations, Asian Pacific American Advocates and the League of United Latin American Citizens.\n\nP.S. Less then 24 hours after the shooting started, there were 100's (if not 1000's) of articles out online by left-leaning MSM outlets already trying to discredit independent media's questions and reports of this tragic event.  My prayers to the victims' families, law enforcement, and those adversely affected by this hateful act of violence.\n\nOh  - And America - Turn in your guns!  When put in a life-threatening situation, call Jimmy Kimmel.  Then call Hillary Clinton.  Then call Keith Olbermann. Then call the Young Turks.  Then call the LA Times.  Then call the NY Times.  Then kiss your butt goodbye!
New Shooter's vIdeo on my channel<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Evil has no colour. Evil has no religion.
What if Jason  HAD hollered into\nhis mike: Shots fired! Everyone RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!! And 200 \npeople got trampled to death,\nand it turns out to be only firecrackers like\neveryone thought in the first place.\nJason Aldean would have been\npaying out to lawyers and victims families \nfor the rest of his\nlife!!!!
A lot of you may think that having strong restrictions on guns may be worthless, but Australias last mass shooting was in 1996 and right after that event our government decided to put VERY strong restrictions on guns and we haven't had a mass shooting since. I was just in Alabama for a school trip and no one from my school had ever seen a gun being carried by anyone other than a law enforcement officer, and we saw a normal everyday man who was carrying a gun and it scared the shit out of us. yes i know that a lot of you will say that the gun dosent kill people, people kill people, but guns are the fastest and easiest way to kill a lot of people in a short amount of time.
Why didn't that country singer warn anybody when he realized what was happening and ran?
Time for police to be trained in the use of sniper rifles ,one high powered night vision sniper rifle could have dropped that piece of scum in a second ,politicians have this kind of protection ,why not the public .
This sickens me but as an Australian America sickens me also for continuing to allow this to happen.
I'm so happy to live in Australia. I've never ever heard a gun or seen one. This is so sad that this is the reality of America. No country is shocked anymore of these shootings.\n\nI hope one day this will end for you America. You deserve to go to a concert, the cinema, a club and feel safe.
How may people does it take? \nHow many brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, sons, daughters need to be shot and brutally murdered for gun control to be taken seriously. Are we just going to sit by and watch innocent people being murdered without doing a single thing. The only way this will stop is by illegalising guns. Please this has to stop.
If you want more What If videos, give this video a like!
Thats why i drink with a straw
tell a person they have cancer and watch it rip them apart dont tell the person they have cancer and you will see how much better they deal with the illness it will still kill them but a lot of damage is caused by your mind the same way people get stabbed without feeling it bit by sharks and not notice and get shot and keep walking its not until you take in what happens and appropriate an expectation of what is happening or what should be happening that things go wrong a better example would have been people who look away from the needle in a blood test but who gives a shit the point is clear stop hassling me
I only drink water
I drink about 2 glasses of pepsi max a week, just thought I'd let you know😂
That's why I drink Dr. Pepper 10
How much cocaine were there in the orginal? I need to try it!
I have not had soda in 2 weeks I think I'm going insane
Wish you'd do less rambling and stay on topic
Huh? This seems... highly exaggerated... I guess if you didn't eat anything as well it would actually have such impacts on you, but my family in Mexico drinks nothing but coke and it hasn't had any of the mentioned side effects on them. When they came visit Canada, they were startled at the fact we drink tap water... cuz you know, over there it's not healthy to drink tap water hence the reason they drink nothing but coke their entire life.
But did it feel good though?
one can of soda in a week. Taste nasty after a while of not drinking soda.
I've probably had about only 3 cups of coke in my life
i personally prefer water over any other drink anyday, and i can't handle drinking fizzy drinks like a coca-cola can in one day
I drink soda maybe once every 3 months. Other than that it’s water for me everyday
you turn fat like my dad
I drink like 1 can per year lol
Hey InfoGraphics show can you do B.R.I.C.S Vs NATO
Coke=compressed brownies in a can
Haven't had a can of soda for over 8 years... I regret nothing
I only drink soda on weekends
none of this has happened to me yet and its been 2 years, its not just coke, but i drink pepsi dr pepper and sprite, but ive only drinken JUST soda for almost 2 years and im still healthy
I see what you did there at the title :)
... I thought this was about cocaine...\n\nKinda disappointed, am I alone?
i didnt realize most sugar came from drinks. i drink a lot of lightly sweetened tea (from cane sugar), but i think i'll stop that from now on.
Ohh sigh 😔😔😔what I wouldn't do to have a real cocoa cola from back in the day when cocaine ruled the streets lol
this is why i drink Dr, Pepper instead...
Ron Swanson got it right: The whole point of this country is if you want to eat garbage, balloon up to 600 pounds and die of a heart attack at 43, you can! You are free to do so. To me, that’s beautiful
I love how the title clarifies they're talking about the drink and not the drug
I drink a soda maybe once or twice a month... so... I'm good
I only drink sprite and dr.peper
2-3 per day, used to be 3 to 5
We all know how much people like to overdose on coke... thats a savage line
Just give them a Pepsi
I don't drink soda, I think its nasty
I drink like a can of soda every two weeks.
Good thing I don't like soda, cake, and cupcakes
I was just drinking Diet Coke and then this came up. That made me ask myself should I drink this? I know it isn't the original Coke but now I'm afraid of Soda now
It's worse then you think. My aunt drank nothing but coke and rc and she developed a serious skin probably.
My uncle is addicted to Coca-Cola :/
I try to stay under 25g as a rule (Have been for almost a year) but always seem to pass it. I do pretyt much always stay under 50g though. Good thing I'm more of a salty guy ;)
i drink sprite like once a week and like 2-3 times a week ill drink green tea, and every weekday ill have 1 small cup of coffee, other than that it's mostly water.
This is why I drink bleach instead
Well I am going water only now
Who was drinking cocal when watching this?
I was eating some buncha crunch watching this
I think the moral of the story here is that even without taking into account the brooding health consequences, it's common sense that anyone would get tired of dranking the same thing over and over, no matter how heavenly it is.
There’s no way 40% of people who watched this video don’t drink any soda
Coke, and Pepsi are both cancer.
Coke is so overrated, Sprite and Fanta all the way!
I don’t like soda
I don't drink any soda at all I HATE it!
Coke is one hell of a beverage...!
“What if you only ever drank water
HAHAHAHA\n I DON'T DRINK A SINGLE SERVING OF POP IN A _MONTH._\nmostly because the caffiene makes my stomach hurt.\nI'M STILL THE HEALTHIEST PERSON ALIVE.
I drink probably two cans a day. On average. But I also drink water and milk and other fluids that are required. But I can definitely tell you that I probably will be a little bit more careful than before.
this is why i stopped drinking any type of soda
Good thing I don't drink soda at all. Water, milk, and the occasional powerade/Gatorade.
Just look at John Daly, PGA Tour player who smokes and only drinks Diet Coke
what do you use to animate these? Seriously i know this may sound stupid but i can imagine you using pivot or some downgraded version of adobe animate
selling 1.9 billion cans a day does not necessarily mean that 1.9 billion people buy it. Many people who drink it, drink multiple cans a day. Also, you can avoid negative impact on your teeth by using a straw.
Who is drinking a coke while watching this?😂
I'll be right back, just gonna brush my teeth again.
If you only drink Dr. Pepper, you become immortal.
This is why I drink pespi
I dont need coke or pepsi i drink dr.pepper
Luckily I only drink water
So you'd also have to stop brushing your teeth?
You know it's 2017 when you have to specify that it's the soft drink and not drugs
My dad doesn't let ya have cokes he said either tea or water or you go thirsty
the only time I drink soda is during the summer and even then it's only about every other week at dinner /: water is the way to go
What happens if you drink pepsi max and nothing else
i drink  like 5 cokes a week but i live in the uk am i unhealthy?
So I was done watching this one video in my recommendations, so I went to the fridge with my phone to get some coke, and the next video that was right after the vid I just watched was this and I was speechless.
No wonder why edd from Ed’s world died
The sugar tax may be convincing the drinks makers from reducing sugar in their drinks, but they're probably replacing that sugar with artificial sweeteners. Not sure if the evidence is _conclusive_, but there is evidence that artificial sweeteners also contribute to weight gain and potentially other health issues. It's best just to soda.\n\nAnd don't think you can escape it by drinking fruit juice. These may be more nutritious than soda, but they still contain a lot of sugar. The reason why fruit is good for you and fruit juice isn't is because of the fibre content of fruit. I can't remember the exact reason, but I imagine it's because it fills you up, which would significantly reduce your sugar cravings. Whatever the reason, have an apple and a glass of water rather than a glass of apple juice!
I haven't had any type of soda for about 2 and a half years... and it feels amazing. I only drink water or milk.
I have drank pretty much only soda for as long as I can remember. I'm 18 and I am not in shape but I'd consider myself as decently healthy, I play basketball and other things on occasion and have healthy teeth. Is there time to turn this around and only drink water or is my body already fucked from the soda?
What if you only ate pizza
Today i have not had a sweat drick! I have only drank some milk and water.
Wait coke had coke in it hahahahaha🤣🤣
Video should be 5 seconds long and just say “ You’ll Die “
The best drink ever is sugar free monster, it’s exactly the same taste and for 24 fl ounces, you only get 15 calories
I've completely cut soda out of my diet but i still cant lose weight..
I only drink coke with vodka
never drinking coke again
What if you only drank lucozade?

Really Princess????? 😑😑
When tamera is more freaky than u...
Sorry I made my comment before watching the whole video. Did she just say it only has to be in the bed? Girlll bye! Boring lol. I'm not saying you have to be freaked out but Not even in the shower with your man or in a car. That sad when Tamera even like girl you never done it on the floor at least lol
Jeannie's face at 0:33 lmfaooooooo
Ray j is ugly so I don't blame her #keepthelightslow
Wow really but you had a sex tape why wasent you conservative then? Just saying
A Lady never tells what she does in the bedroom. Any woman can stop living a certain lifestyle and be conservative if she wants to. It is called reinventing yourself. Alot of people saw that sex tape, maybe Ray J wants to be silent about sex with his Wife. And Floyd seems like an ass, can't blame her for wanting better. Leave Princess alone.
If that's what does it for her, that's great, at least she doesn't make compromises to please just her partner like so many do. If he's still good with what she needs to be in the mood, why not applaud her for that?
There goes tam tam with the closet again
She contradicted herself big time. First she said she got to have the lights off and darkness because she can't have distractions, then the bitch said she wants to do it on a private jet with a loud engine and 30,000 feet above ground with all sorts of distractions. Girl bye with yo lying ass LOL
she's pretty but ray j's freaky ass isn't gonna stay with this prude.. even tamera is less of a prude lol
the girl is lyin !!! she tries too hard to adopt an attitude lol
they just let anyone on this show now.
Y'all gone let her lie like that her man is Ray j
I feel like Adrienne be trying to hard to get attention on this show like everytime she says something and no one pays her any attention she has to look and stare into the audience like she needs someone to agree with her (0 :20- 0:25)
lol I guess threesomes are the new conservative!! 🐸☕️.. She's beautiful thoe
Soooo she's either having boring sex or some boujie sex? Ray J is soon to stray LOL
Saw the entire episode and Adrienne and Tamera were a little shady towards Princess. It's strange how catty insecure women can get around a pretty girl.
NO wonder why she cant get pregnant , high maintenance before sex gurl bye !!!
Too much boo. This a Savage world you might want to be quiet and keep your man no one needed to know that
If true, she's a boring bitch!! smh
Well honey, do you...
I don't believe her.  If she's telling the truth she sounds like someone who was molested as a child
They should make Princess the permanent 5th seat. She vibes well with the group.
princess and jeanie hair are everything
Did she just say light is off?
Well miss Princess Love came for everyone on Twitter. Lmao.
how you tryna have sex on a private jet but can’t have sex on a kitchen counter? girl if you don’t go elsewhere 🙄😩
Umm...didn’t she admit to threesomes on Love and hip hop. Now we switching it up.
You know it's bad when Tamera is concern
yeah right princess you know ray j wants you to get your whips& chains out of the closet lol....conservative i don't quite believe it lol.
Adrianne ‘s make up is..... not her ....  best omg my poor baby who did that
She just said on The Breakfast Club that they had threesomes why she lying?
I'm like you Princess!
THEY DID ADRIENNE WRONG WITH HER MAKE UP WTF GHOST ASS 😭😭😭 not right
Ray J went from freak to prim and proper with this chick. I like it.
I'm DEAD!!! Jeannie's face looking at Princess
That's why his ass cheats.... Mmmhmmmm. He fucking some crazy freak believe dat!
#PettySexxy#💁💁💁\nSounds like Ray J might be cheating on her soon and making a Part 2 to his first sextape 🍵😂 Just sayin'!
Listen men always date the freaky type but they wife the conservative ones.

Mister sex tape Ray J done married a starfish.
I wonder how it is 4 Adrienne & her kung fu panda aka grandpa Israel
Why turn the lights off lol. I wanna see everythang!!!
I swear she gets more and more gorgeous everyday😍😍
Where has Princess been!? She's a main cast member on the show & we've only seen her in like 3 episodes
Gurl you better get better at that.
You know it gotta be opposite day when Tam Tam look like the freaky one
I thought princess was savage.... My bad...😂😂😂😂
TBH I don’t think she was worried about what she was saying I think and this is my opinion she scared something might get leaked...cause now days you can’t just do anything normal anymore especially celeb like mostly everything they do is for the public and now they have to worried about they’re private moment become the public view as well
She's scared he might record them😂
Shes Boojee  (i dont even know why but Boojee is the first word that cones to mind)
She soooooooooo sweet I love her
She’s so pretty😍😍 & conservative girl you’re boring as hell!
Jeannie I love you girl!! And Tam 😍😍😍, on the floor... in the closet.. YAAAS!!\n Love the classy with a side a ratchet.
when Adrienne said she enjoyed the visuals i got a horrendous mental image
Princess STOP! You was a stripper shaking it for dollars now you're conservative.?...chile that's your Husband! You betta
I'm similiar, I need to have the setting right to get in the mood
That is so boring.
In a closet? Girl what sized closet you got? 😂😂
Has she not seen his sex tape ?
Tamera looking like girl I did more stuff then you lmfaoooo
The lies ppl tell.... they silly if they believe this!!! Coming from an ex stripper....!!!???
I cannot believe Princess, why is she popular anyway?  Ray J made a sextape with Kim and he is a freak so I am not sure how he is settling for this type of sad ass sex
And I thought I was boring lol
Is princess pregnant ? Didn't see the whole interview but she looks great?
She sounds like a very boring lover
Everyone looks great in this clip!
I feel bad for her man
girl by princesses is so f****** bougie
Ray j always hit it first
I don't understand people who fantasize about having sex on a private jet.......like that is the most boring fantasy in life lol
You need to give some exciting sex🤜🏾🤜🏾 I don't really believe her☝🏾 ray is to wild👐🏾 for bed sex only🙅🏿
All I gotta say is That's why her ass is getting played!!!! Like do you even suck dick?
They have a basic boring sex life,Princess looks like she's lame in bed!
Ok I now understand why Ray J had to live it up before settling with her... He new damn well it's gonna be a boring sex life after that.
Some of your comments are so rude tbh y'all really only watching the show just to hate. Wouldn't be surprised if they turn off the comments at some point
Prude

She has a strange sex appeal. Don't get me wrong; she's attractive of course.  Very feminine but when she rocks the guitar, she combines a unique blend of femininity and masculinity (if that makes sense). Love her music, especially her last album.
Well that was artsy. I want cake now.
This song explains my life in vivid detail.
Hot damn what a track
I WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR HER (WDSLM) youtu.be/MYm9bJUHN08  #stvincentfan
the irony here is she is becoming everything she hates
I kinda miss when Annie used to shred on her guitar. I don't really hear any of her in the music anymore beside her humor
all I need in life are more white musicians that aren't afraid to use bass😍😍😍😍
why is it only new music that trends on YT, get some old music trending!

Amazing video for an incredible song. Absurdly good.

This looks like lady Gaga got possessed by Amy winehouse
well this beats the shit out of 'new york'
Do they think letting us see the studio will make the video cool?
St. Vincent's videos always look like a Moto phone commercial, and I love it
Can't wait for the album to drop! The same day as Beck's new record. It'll be a great day
Looks like a lady gaga music video
That part at 2:30 should be a whole other song
I love this new Annie's aesthetic, this is gonna be the best St Vincent's era besides Strange Mercy
a lead riff from a Kraftwerk song and Steve Albini's Roland drum machine.. Annie is fucking killing it again
Love it! Im missing the crazy guitar shredding, but I love it!
FINALLY video! and where's the ending?
Great tune. That's an especially cool extreme close-up vocal sound in the verses.
IS THE ONLY WAY THE IM DISCOVERED THIS MESS IM BN,INTHE FIRE
Infinite Jest reference with the eating green mould??
Anyone else thought they read Los Angeles
So this song is about a place that sounds perfect but is actually not?
St. Vincent did that. \nLos Angeles = cancelled \nEveryone ageless and shook
Beautiful. This is one of the best music videos of yours!
enjoying very much how the colors remind of the digital witness vid. even though this is awesome in so many different ways.
I love her guitar. One of the coolest new  guitar shapes in a long time.
A 165K view music vid and it's on trending? Yeah, this is definitely not promotion... definitely not...
She’s having so much fun
damn look at all the mr meeseeks.
some parts are a tribute to the plastic sugery scene from Brazil by Terri Gilliam
So this video is here talking shit about white rich women that live in low angeles.
Meu deus Annie, os clipes dessa era estão lindos demais! ❤❤❤❤❤
Been listening to you for years, love how diverse your music is. Gets me through alot
i think this would be better if she didn't try to look to detached ;_;
I swear, I jumped whenever it started I thought my volume was all the way down so I turned it up, and it scared tf out of me😂😂😂
What the fuck happened Annie? Video is really cool but these two singles have been some of her worst music to date, and it's all been downhill from Strange Mercy and doesn't look like that's changing.
this is a different mix than the single version, v strange

The production is awful. The song writing is here or there, but getting Taylor Swift's producer wasn't worth it. :(
A little too close to Nine Inch Nails.
I dunno, soundwise I think this was done better by Garbage twenty years ago and the message of the song while valid isn't the most original either. I give it a *shrug* out of five (with a small plus for all the colours).
If I wasn't gay before
is this song about cara delevingne?

Those sheeps can deal extra damage!\nTOO BAD! Because their range is lower!

I love the conclusion at the end. SO beautiful
Sounds like the farma corporations wanted to get a hold of the profits so they declared the cyclopamine not safe and instead they developed a drug that does the same thing but I bet with worst side effects...way to go America letting corporations run wild.
Did the sheep blink or wink? The world may never know...
Is Wild corn lilly also called  western false hellebore (Veratrum californicum)? http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/44550/title/The-Cyclopes-of-Idaho--1950s/
Now I want to know what the real sheep look like. Should I?
anyone love the animation? \n\n\n\n\nme!🙌
the scientist in orange looks like a teen stanford pines
The real question is does the gene make you run faster?
Ok, why does the cartoon cyclopamine have two eyes???
Cloud sheep
Loved it, Thanks
Sonic the Hedgehog gene
Good work on the animation
Tien voice over is the best
So that's what my dick's been eating
please make a video on discovery of zero.
The stranger case I actually find how to pronounce that freaken name. Nuguyun? N-guy-en? ..
Too bad Tien wasn’t talking about three eyed sheep
We watched this in class
Cyclopamine... is that where Cyclophosphamnide (cancer drug) synthesized from?
This is the link for that kinds of sheep in real life.... https://youtu.be/vLHc5PKJyAc
The end music was interesting
Anyone thought that sheep is a reference from the odyssey in which the sheeps are in the cyclops islands?
In the cyclops greek tale with Odysseus there are sheep.. hmm..

sonic the hedgehog+Gene=hedgehog Gene ... That's good to know.

I have one tiny comment: the DNA (1:19) is drawn incorrectly (it is left handed but should be right handed). But as usual, the video is lovely and I very much enjoyed it :)
your new animator did a stellar job. please keep him.

why is cyclopamine in corn lillys and why do they bind onto smoothened?
sonic the hedgehog is bad
I bet Nobody SAW that coming
what ever you do, never, EVER look up cyclops sheep. its nightmare fuel.
It would make sense someone named tien talks about some thing with three eyes
Do not search on google cyclops sheep! I repeat! Do not google it! My eyes are scared for life
1:45 that's not a nose
The stripes on those farmers' shirts aren't very realistic.
Isn't it the Sonic the Hedgehog gene? Named after the video game character
so that's why sonic only has one eye... with two pupils
Also, part of the reason of how the mythical Greek monster derived or inspired from, women in Ancient Greece sometimes ingest certain herbs when they are pregnant and give birth to cyclopian stillbirths.
So this is why sonics eyes are conjoined...
Omg that pun at the end AHAHAHA
Still waiting for the riddle question.
Did you know that SHH means Sonic Hedgehog ? Yeah those scientists were gamers too !
come on, say the full name, Sonic Hedgehog
Who else searched this on google?

Hola teacher ether soy empieza con C y acaba con R ❓❓
I thought this was about the flesh-eating sheeps owned by Polyphemus.
Now I miss the legendary Robin William.
I can name Ariel and Bells' voice actors. Come on. They are classic characters. \n\nThe voice actors shouldn't matter (for the same reason you don't like them). Robin Williams was, is and will always be the *only* exception.
I've always hated the use of big names for voice actors. I first noticed it in Shrek and by Shrek 3 it was just a gimmick to promote a crappy movie: Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake were dating, so the latter voice acted in the movie. It didn't make the writing not suck. Compare those regular actors to voice acting legends like Hank Azaria or John Dimaggio too - those guys can do anything. Dimaggio was Bender in Futurama, Wakka in Final Fantasy X, and Jake in Adventure Time. He's massively talented and incredibly diverse. Few regular big name actors have the ability to use a voice other than their own (though Jason Segel isn't too bad). I feel like using big names has overshadowed these amazing talents and they aren't usually as good as the trained voice actors.

Big name actors of just to get you in the theaters
I love King of Thieves
Mork & Mindy ended in 1982.  Robin Williams didn't have a hit movie till Good Morning Vietnam in the late 80s.
This is one the popular tricks in the whole entertainment industry. Like how kpop idols get featured in all the variety shows and cast in all the dramas, even though their main job is singing and dancing, not acting.
Favorite voice actor in a Disney movie, Frank Welker as the cave of wonders in Aladdin
Honestly, I agree that it can be a distraction to know who voices what. However, that being said, I did see Dwayne as Maui had a singing part, and instantly went to go check out any youtube footage I could find, because I grew up when he was a super popular wrestler, and I couldn't imagine him singing. Now, I can. A+
Robin Williams was the BEST Genie ever!
Think it’s time to rank the renaissance movies and all the straight to DVD sequels.
If Robin Williams wasn't the Genie, Aladin would never have worked as a movie, may have even bombed
any comment that there a shot of Will Smith in Robins acceptance speech? just a cool moment.
You should do a video series on Zoids: New Century. Love the anime. Also Full Metal Alchemist.
Was your plan to bribe someone that demanded to be paid less...? (6:23)\nThe way he said that, so great. I can just see how that would have played out, Robin Williams was the man.
I miss Robin Williams more than I miss most family members...
Supercarlinbrothers, you should do a theory that the movies, Robots and Yak the giant king, take place in the same universe in different time periods.
1:06 I REALLY Don't Like That Movie 😒
Jay and Ben do you think you could look into the Wizard Of Oz theory? I know ot is not disney or Pixar but I feel like it would be a fun topic. The theory is how each element of the story represents the Great Depression and how the slippers were suppose to be Silver not Ruby
I think my favorite Disney voice actor is James Earl Jones as Mufasa. Yeah, probably not very original, but it’s true. Strength, presence, warmth, and fatherliness. That’s what you get when you cast a Shakespearean actor to do the voice of a king.\n\nNowadays, almost all the voices just sound like random people you could run into on the street. Forgettable as you could ever hope to be.
please tell me I am not the only one who knew who voiced Belle and Ariel
_This MUST be why I cannot download any of the Aladdin movie songs sung by Genie (Robin Williams) on Apple music_
The best voice-cast Disney film was... Mulan. Ming-na Wen had to pull of a wide range as TWO characters--male and female. The other cast members included most Asian actors, from BD Wong (Jurassic Park) to James Shigeta (Die Hard) to Pat (MISTER MIYAGI!) Morita as the Emperor to James (Hardest Working Man in Show Business) Hong, who was in everything from Avatar the Last Airbender to Chinatown!
I like Will Smith and all but... NO ONE CAN REPLACE ROBIN WILLIAMS.
Who's your favorite voice actor..\nTERA STRONG!!\n...in a Disney movie\nUmmmmmmmm
I cannot take Maui seriously for the very reason that it is Dwayne Johnson voicing him, I just know his voice way too well and can't get past that to just enjoy Maui as a character. Same goes for the elephant in the pistachios commercials, I can't not think about it being John Cena... this may also just mean I've watched way too much wrestling in my life.\n\nI don't think big names should matter when casting a particular role but it will definitely help sell the movie.\n\nAs for favorite voice actors, it's really hard to choose anyone other than Robin Williams. How can one not love Batty, Genie, Fender, Ramon and Lovelace?
Billy Crystal as Mike Wasoski idc that that's Pixar he was great for the role
Why is the title Robin Williams was almost not Genie when you say in the video that they literally wrote the role for him and didn't want anyone else to speak him?
the voice actor should only matter if their voice talent is great. Eddie Murphy, Jack Black, Mike Myers, Jim Carrey, John Goodman, Gilbert Gottfried, Mark Harmon, James Woods, and the late Robin Williams are prime examples of actors whos' voice roles are not only recognizable, but also well trained and full of talent. When a famous actor is also a talented voice actor like Mike Myers or the late Robin Williams, and has a wide variety of voices to add to the character they portray while coupled with good animation, you reach a point where the character often takes precedence over the actor and while you certainly know who is voicing the character you also recognize the particular role they are playing apart from their many other roles. Someone like Dwayne Johnson may be a popular actor, but outside of the singing I would not recognize his role in Moana from a voice playback of the Scorpion King because he has no voice talent.
Weren't you like 17 when Shrek came out? You wanted to believe in a talking donkey
To put it simply on the marketing side of importance of a big name actor/actress is yes they are the ones that will sell the best now for the quality of the production itself that comes down to the specific person, Robin and will are two examples of quality actors for a roll that it is very much worth getting the big name, while others it is highly dependent on coworker relationships, subject matter the character covers and so many other issues that can make casting hard to begin with
Type Robin Williams testifies before Congress in the search bar.\n\nHe read a prepared speech (by Billy Crystal, who had a sudden medical emergency) on the growing homelessness crisis in America.\n\nIt was May, 1990, and his testimony was in front of , among other people Ted Kennedy.
here in mexico is very rare to have famous voice actors for animated movies and any movie in general
Jodi Benson is Ariel and Page O'Hara is Belle.
Just showed your channel to a couple of Disney fans and potter heads in my class btw love the work keep it up
Robin William and Mandy Moore are my favaorite voice actors
Hey guys! I make youtube videos! If anyone wants to support each other let me know! I make videos about beauty, Disney, movies and more! https://www.youtube.com/haleybuchanan93
I LOVE the Genie! He’s my favourite Disney character, hands down. I can’t imagine him being voiced by anyone other than Robin Williams.
I don't know if this has anything to do with genie or not but in anime there are big name voice actors who are known for voice acting and fans will follow their favorites to new animes like how some people follow live action actors to movies they might not have otherwise seen. I think this might be a bit better because you don't think of the actor went you're watching the show (like what you mentioned with Shrek) because you only really see their faces in interviews and you don't even think of other characters they've done before because they do this all the time and work on changing their voices from show to show so they match the character making it almost a different art form all together
Worst three wishes in the history of wish fulfillment, as said by Colin Mochrie from Whose Line Is It Anyway?:\nI'll take two cokes and a bag of chips.
Like in the case with robin, i think it should only matter in special ocasions
Imho, Robin Williams kinda ruined Aladdin's chance at mega popularity, he changed the character to his own liking. Because he wanted to.
#25 in trending.\nlet me say that again, a video I AM WATCHING, I mean ME,\nis #25 on trending...\ngood job!\n(I really have NO idea what that means...)
No all the big names they have in the My Little Poney movie are distracting from the mane cast.
My favorite voice acyor is Robin Williams,  and he is actually one of my favorites male  actors with morgan freeman and dominic sherwood

My life is complete!! I was featured on super Carlin sock club!!!!!
I freaking love Robin Williams. No joke I wrote my 7th grade long comp MCAS about him after he died
I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing when companies do this, for example Dwayne was great as Maui but an example of this done badly was Rihanna in Home cause that was just an obvious cash grab for a movie they knew would be bad
OH MY GOSH SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE ACTORS! I'M NOT ALONNNNNNNNE
The best singer name was undeniably The Rock. Couldn't help but to watch you're welcome in english xD
I have a Harry Potter question: why was it that Hermoine didn't get expelled when she repaired Harry's glasses in diagon alley? I mean she was underage and there was no under aged magic outside of school. Harry was expelled for producing a patronous (yes I understand that a patronous is more powerful than a repairing spell) but why wasn't she like given a warning or expelled?
The look of the Genie was inspired by the work of illustrator, Al Hirschfeld.
My favorite Disney voice actor is Eddie Murphy as Mushu
It's weird as I would say the majority of the time I don't care who voiced or starred in any film as it's the story that counts. However, when it comes to incredible people like Morgan freeman for example I love to know if he's going to star in a film because I can guarantee the film is going to be good. \nIt takes a very special talent to draw me to a film simply because they're in it!
To bad robin is dead
I think, at least for the musicals, Disney shouldn't focus so much on getting big-name actors since some actors can't sing, so just get a decent singer and make them famous.
WAIT WHAT?! Ok so. I thought you and your brother were the same person. I mean I knew there was a brother I thought I just never saw one of their videos and I just realized you guys were two people.
You should rank all the sequels 😂
All the posters, pillows, toys, etc. are amazing.
I like how the only request they honoured is being paid less.
Hey can you make a vid on why Minnie has a cat I mean she's a mouse and cats hate and eat mice
No, big name people shouldn't matter to me because their just normal people who got lucky and there's probly someone out there with a similar voice that could've gotten casted and they would've for sure taken the part also my favorite voice actor in a Disney movie is Dwayne the rock Johnson. Also I used to think Disney was disnep because of how it looks in the movies 😂
Binge watching your videos because just found out i lost my house ugh fml
Aladin was my faverouite movie growing up how did I not know there was a number 2 let alone a 3
My favourite voice actor in a Disney film (and in general) is Jim Cummings who is sometimes overlooked because he often plays background characters but has been the voice of many main characters such as; Pete, Tigger, Whinnie the Pooh, Darkwing Duck,  Taz, Ed (one of the hyenas in the Lion King), Ray (from Princess & the Frog) and hundreds of other characters. His talent is almost scary at times but is fun to listen too. :D
Hey supercarlinbrothers, ive just finshed playing a game of disney trival pursuit with my mum and one of the questions was 'what animal is sabor from tarzan' i said a jaguar, they said a leopard how leopards arent found in jungles. What are your thoughts, what animal is he, please do a theroy on it i need to know.
It totally shows Will Smith at 1:35 in the Acceptance Video. Predicting the Future?
I love how this is on trending lmao. SCB never gets enough love so maybe they can get more because they're on the trending page now.
but what if then donkey sounds like eddy ? mm ?\n\nwhy is knowing who did  the voice a deterrent??\n\ni mean , usually you see the actor.. acting..out a role. well known actors. \nDo you then also think' well i know that actor. so it makes me disbeleave ? '

Like all they do is complain about paparazzi but if there wasn't paparazzi they wouldn't have careers. The Kardashians may have been through a lot but my God, they are extremely shallow people
Everyone post an ugly pic of themselves online and see if you act happy
It's because she has paps photoshop her pics when they are taken lol and these weren't photoshopped. Such a first world problem, get over it.
Kim grow TF up u have kids now Jesus
😂🤣🤣🤣 this proves that shes sooo fake
😱 she got mad #lovekardashiansjenner 💙
these birches sound stupid as fucktthey be telling the paparazzi their locations trust me they need that attention that's how they build their brand by paparazzi following them taking pictures of them
Who is this girl sitting next to Kim HER BODY IS PERFECT , I'm not into girl but my Gooooood
Just because you can't photoshop your pictures .. you're ugly and full of plastic anyways
She got mad because she didn't pay her deal with the paps to Photoshop her pics.
Kim, there's people that are dying.
So narcissistic
PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING
How self centered can you be .there are people with real problems in the world and this is what she's worried about smh.
I would hate an be upset as well I'd I was in her situation
But Kim wait a minute you have the perfect body remember so what are you getting your panties in a twist for....Well at least you act like you do but wake up call you don't.... 😄😆
A singer that who can't sing even if it's just for one night for exemple Mariah is insulted. An actress who does a bad performance too. I'm wondering why Kim thinks that she can avoid it. You made your appearance a business this is all your fault.
yes u do look like that! u just show the world ur photoshop photos....
I kinda feel like kim doesn’t want to accept the way she looked
Kim there's people that are dying~Kourtney Kardashian
Wait so you don't care about social media but ur rushing to untag yourself?? Lol
Anyone have the picture?
“How you gon be mad on vacation “
I wanted kourtney to day “Kim there’s people that are dying”
I really wish that these people would have respect. People deserve their own privacy.
Cellulite is normal lol
When your career is based on your looks, people are gonna scrutinize you honey. Sorry about it
1st world problems.
MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Super-could'n't-give-a-shit ....
🐍 🐍 🐍
Omg drama
don't be so worried Kim, you're pretty
I mean but if the picctured depicts\nSomething false as she says then just leave it alone I mean girl if you feel like you are gorgeous and have a beautiful  body who cares 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
I’m sorry, I understand her security fears but the ‘scrutiny’???... I wouldn’t say Kardashian‘s try to avoid that. She takes so many selfie’s that she approves first and then puts them online/that’s the only difference. We all have bad photos, in real time.
OMG Kim looks so bad in this side commentary.. What happened to her beautiful face it's such a shame
What a liar...she took pics during that trip and that picture was real. Hahahaha
Me me myself ...
Kim people are dying
Kim there people dieng 😂
Kim its always late
😂😂😂😂😂
Hilarious
If it was a good pic that doesn't look like her she wouldn't even complain about it. This family is so narcissistic
I'm so unphotogenic if I was famous I'd be so ugly in all the pics
Oh get over yourself Kim, people are dying in this world
why does steph have a cigerette in her hands? the kardashians dont even smoke!!
Que dia da semana e horário  esta passando novos episódios no canal..
Is she claiming that the paps photoshopped her pics for worse ?
All she said was that she doesn't look like that! I would hate to be followed all the time, I would hit the papps
Kim's body really doesn't look like those horrible pictures the paps put out though so I understand her frustration because after that people started attacking and making fun of her
i cant stand leache in the red. shes such a leache and a suck up, i cannot stand that girl. shes like THEY GOT US. bish u mean Kim because the only reason youre in the pic is because of Kim!
Sam Hyde is the voice of our generation, the only person actually not afraid to joke about anything in this toxic political climate. he's really smart too, and would make a great guest. Norm please.
Jim does get funny towards the very end. Also he actually talks about sublimation of sexual energy and internal alchemy i.e. (al)chemicals the glands in the brain produce when you abstain from sex and the orgasm energy eventually goes in rather than out, then moves up the spine to the brain and you go to Heaven through the pearly gate which really is perceived as two brilliantly white arch/arched Angels. B E A Utific vision. Jim taught me how to remember how to spell beautiful. Remember the Golden rule when commenting on Youtube and elsewhere please. I could say a lot more about this from personal experience yet we get socially crucified now and just like they said of Jesus the Christ(anointed) its of the devil. Treat others as you would treat yourself and this online world will get allot better. Before you post contemplate yourself as the recipient of your post.
Jim, as talented and gifted as he is, couldn’t be more wrong when he says nothing matters and we don’t matter. Everyone matters and everything we do matters a great deal! It’s sad to see him so off in his understanding of life and the nature of reality.
Why is it that all brilliant minds seem to always reach a certain level of madness in their later years?
I have really enjoyed all Norm's shows, but this was horrible. Jim Carrey was painful from the very 1st second.
Carrey lost his beard and his mind all in a matter of weeks!
WOW   ! ! !       Norm McDonald   and   Jim  Carrey   are  Tremendously -FUNNY   together  ! !!    ( sorry ,    i   state   the   Obvious  )
I understand if Adam being there is a comfort for Norm, but if not, please take him out of the equation. Norm, you don't need the crutch. You can do this alone.
He is the room.  It's bizzare, how does he do it.  He has yes anded existing.  How... How do I...  I want...
What about the Ripley's Believe it or Not movie directed by Tim Burton??  Will Jim ever make that fucking movie?  I read that screenplay via bootleg and it is absolutely AMAZING!!!!!
Thanks for the fantastic and entertaining interview. I think Jim, Norm and Adam are free of fear and judgment and how they conduct themselves is perfect, as they aren't my monkeys to direct. It is easier to criticize than create so if you are wasting time projecting and posting judgment, go live your own life and do something that makes others feel good instead. Thanks again for the entertainment Norm! (Consider disabling comments on these vids as they are a distraction to your entertainment.)
Get this man on the Joe Rogan Podcast
Pedo's .... pedo's everywhere. we see you Norm. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viM5h0IYvnU
Norm: No, they're thieves! Adam: Oh ok. Adam is a lowkey comedic genius lmao
I think Jim's a good Jim \nWait sex alemcy? o.O quick get a dictionary
Jim Carrey looks bored with life.  I think he has done it all and now it's just his personal playground.  Great talent , I'd love to hear more stories!
I've never seen a show suck the life out of the guests quite like this show..
I didn't understand all the negative comments prior to watching this video. Now I get it. You all must be republicans. Anyways love me so Jim Carrey.
Would some please level that desk its killing my ocd
Baby heartbeat listener Tracker- Heartbeat monitors application has the particular fun and nonmedical objective. \nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appgametechnologies.baby_heart_rate_monitor_listener&hl=en
What does Jim Carrey, Will Ferrell and Adam Sandler have in common? \n\nCorrect answer gets a cookie
Jim is so funny I couldn't stop laughing
Who is Jim carrey talking about when he says ekart was great.  Ekart cohen like norm is suppose to know who he is?  Norm asks Jim who is someone brilliant you have met.  Exkart Jim says.  Who is this please so I can research them.
Jim and Norm are both BRILLIANT
Lose the ego become an Atheist. Religion is intellectual cancer.
I request Charlie Day as a guest
Where did his beard go?????
so far it sounds like a coincidence i gotta tell ya
I'm reading comments of ignorant people saying Jim lost his mind and what not, but they dont even understand enlightenment and the level of which Jim Carrey has crossed. He understand the truth of his mind and the life around him. So for someone in the comments to say they feel bad for him, shouldnt even have an opinion of something they clearly dont comprehend. Alot of people are also not able to comprehend, or rather not want to, because it is alot for them to even take in. Its only natural percentages of masses to misunderstand those who are more aware then those who deny them and call them crazy. His viewpoints are wonderfuly and beautiful. He's happy because he found himself. His true self. Spare me your ignorant comments as well. If you're too foolish to even listen, what makes you so much better than him or anyone, to call them crazy?
Adam please SHUT THE FUCK UP.
He's whacked out on drugs and coming across like a crazy person and not in a good way
They just weren't listening to each other...
I thought he broke R in NORM too until looked at the logo again.
I heard jim one time on the Howard stern show talk about how he loves his psychedelics & in the long run lsd and mushroom fuck you up like that. I have done a ton of acid and I get his whole shtick he gots going on, the only problem is I don't have money in the bank like he does to quit being me and fully embrace this acid state of mind
I feel like him is pulling the next Charlie sheen. Although I do think Jimmy is a he'll of of a fella.
Fox News has a story about Jim Carrey's comments on Tommy Lee Jones.  So that should bring in plenty more traffic.  Congratulations, Norm!
Let's Go Red Wings
Holy shit, people are hating on Jim way too hard. This is fucking hilarious and just take it for what it is. Jesus Christ.
Jim may be losing his mind a lil, but damnit he's still got it. Coulda sworn he was still in his twenties for most the interview
Jim is just trying VERY hard to display this new character of his, similar to what Andy Kauffman did.  Andy Kauffman wasn't funny he was just different, and people were amused.  If Jim is just bored with what he has created, I would highly NOT recommend trying something new in this manner.  Unless he is truly trying to destroy his legacy.  In that case, he is just bat shit crazy.\nOh.\nAlso the worst episode of Norms show ever.  I also got annoyed by the attention whore stepping all over Norms stories.
I really enjoyed this episode of Om MacDoald live.
I thought it was funny, but I don't like how inconsistently crazy Jim is. Like he is constantly referring to himself as I and me, but as soon as Norm says you he freaks out about it and has to remind him there is no me. He obviously get's what Norm means, he's just being annoying about it. \n\nThere was still a lot of enjoyable moments though, so it was alright overall.
Cacao, cacaitos from the borrachera trees of Colombia same tree for scopolamine, most dangerous drug in the world also know as Burundanga..... same as this drink
Jim Carey trying to be like Russell Brand
30:13 That's what killed me, I went to Vegas You knew Paddock? ;)
norm takes authority in the subtlest of ways
TIL Jim Carey has gone batshit crazy.  Lost me on jesus juice.
Jim Carrey seems a bit of the deep end... I think he'd have a better discussion with Joe Rogan
then i fucking shot it all over her tits and licked it -- WOAH!! WOAH!!
Meh, Jim probably took some acid or something and he's just glowing right now. Hell cringe later, but it's all a part of growing. I like it, he's at least trying to become a better person.
the mics suck so much shit going on
My college roommate played Andy Kaufman's (Jim C) bro in law in Man On The Moon! I never could judge the movie favorably but just wanted to brag on that. Ok I'm done 😀
No bullshit, I had no idea this channel even existed but I'm happy it does
Who are all the losers making brainless comments below? Probably the type that would lick their own cum. Hopefully the majority of them are just passing by.
That guy was s real jerk
Jim Carrey may have been more enlightened as the character he played in the movie Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls. Not only was he enlightened,  he was funnier!
Who the fuck is Jim Carrey? I thought he didn't exist.
No one wanted to look at him
Norm and Jim!! Two of Canada's greatest. But who's the douchebag!?!
reminds me of my philosophy major high school buddy's angsty younger brother
Ugh, I can't watch this. Love Norm and used to like Jim a lot but this is just awkwardly awkward, Sorry.
Jim partially understood half a book about Buddism and had a nervous breakdown
Jim turned into a fucking nut bag... You all need to get a grip, Americans are watching you all melt down
Jim is absolutely grating and cringey with his pompous diatribes. Yeah , I'm a nihislistic atheist too, but I don't fucking rant endlessly about it- because in his own words ''IT DOESN'T FUCKING MATTER''. ultimately what matters are the small moments we have-- and since they exist in a void of meaning, if we attribute meaning to it, then it has meaning. But if you want to be some pretentious guru, just fuck off into the forest somewhere rather than draining everyone around you to satisfy your ego
Jim Carrey does the best impressions of anyone but Jim Carrey.
Sorry, I don't ordinarily comment , but Norm , this was horrible. I don't know if J.C. needs help? But this was so hard to watch . And I love watching most of these, so thanks you for those.
Norm in spite of how bad he’s taken care of himself still has a better memory than Jim Carrey and his bullet coffee.
Jim Carrey is fucking crazy.  And not in a good way.  It worked for the movies, but something is trying way too hard in that guy.  Give me Xanax eating, refusing to drive, shave or a give a fuck to a point of almost feeling sorry for that fella Norm any day.
nice try but it's over, total washout.
This was rather depressing.
Jim is really funny - if you're a 14 yo kid. I used to howl watching his mimick, wierd face and body language humor. but sitting next to norm - he's a total hack
Has this guy ever heard about letting other people talk?
This Stephen Paddock guy, I mean this guy was a real Jerk
I know nothing of Carrey outside of a few of his movies. For this whole episode I thought he was just playing a hammed-up schtick. From reading the comments, does he really buy into the stuff he's saying?
This guy that crawled out of a rhinos ass is trying to be a nonexistent ghost, and i support his crazy ass.
Jim looks like shit! He looks like he has been dead for a week. Edit: what's with the stupid fucking live studio audience laugh track.. WTF happen to your show???
I would love to hear Norm and Adam's conversation the moment Jim left:\nWhat the fuck?\nThat guy was a real jerk!
That guy was a jerk!
Now if Jim had snorted the coffee off the table, THAT would have been funny.
Watch it all the way through. Jim please keep interrupting!
That was great, but exhausting.
we talk and laugh about a train wreck. entertaining. we watch. but who is the person who stops to help the one who is struggling? dives in and saves them? we all watch them struggle. someone dive in. hes hurting. its obvious. someone, Norm, help Jim..
If Jim is not a person, then shoot him in the head and see if he lives.
craig ferguson would be awesome with norm
Hacky
Jim Carreyzi
3 maybe 4 years max
Worse Norm show. This sucks
W
This really got my medulla juice pumping.
Jim Carey is next
Butter? Gross
He has a JASH mug. Ironic anti-humor confirmed.
Glorious!
Why is Jim Carrey nuts now?
Tame that beast Norm.
Settle the fuck down Carrey.. fuck
Adam Eget contributes less than nothing
i cannot sanction this baffoonery
FUCKING CANADIAN PARASITES.\nTIME FOR AMERICA TO ABSORB CANADA AND BE DONE WITH THE CHARADE.
I'm always amazed that, to this day, I don't believe I've never heard of a single book or author that John has recommended. I feel like I live on an entirely different planet or something. \n\nBut to answer the question of books, I love Pat Rothfuss's Kingkiller Chronicle, Jim Butcher's Dresden Files series, Andy Weir's The Martian, Hugh Howey's Silo series, and Ramez Naam's Nexus trilogy. And outside the fiction sphere, Peter Joseph's The New Human Rights Movement is absolutely profound.
BOOK RECS FROM JOHN ARE THE BOMB
I completely agree with you. The Hate you give is a book I ardently believe that everyone should read. A definite YA classic in my eyes.
Memoirs of a Polar Bear is the greatest book ever written.
Exit west, ministry of the upmost happiness
I just finished reading Stephen King's IT. It's pretty brilliant as far as coming of age novels go. His metaphors for the kids' fears and growing up are just impressive. I'm about to read Gucci Mane's autobiography. Can't wait for Turtles.
Violence against black bodies. Have you read it John ?
I love these book recommendation lists.  The descriptions you bring to them are different and helpful in a way that simply reading a cover rarely is.
Kaveh Akbar is a professor at my university (Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN) and I had the pleasure of attending a poetry reading of his last week. Before the reading, I had never heard any of Kaveh's work, nor did I know anything about him. His poetry shocked me. Truly, I can't think of a better word than shocked. I don't usually read poetry, and I won't lie and say that I understood the meaning of every poem he read, but I was enthralled during the entire reading. What astonished me the most about Kaveh was his eloquence, and his kindness. After the reading he answered questions from the audience, and I have never heard someone speak with such precision, clarity and emotion. I could listen to him talk for hours. Unfortunately I will probably never get the opportunity to take his class. I was pleasantly surprised to see you recommend him, John.
Some of my fav books I recently read were the sun is also a star by nicola Yoon, ven by jane teller
I literally just finished The Female of the Species by Mindy McGinnis. I have a hard time getting into books (as of late) but I finished this one in only a few days, would highly recommend.
Hey John I'm not sure jf you've read this already but I highly recommend reading the Witcher saga by Sapkowski. Its originally in Polish but it is soo good. I hope you check it out.
My favorite kind of video! I recently read Tropic of Orange by Karen Tei Yamashita for my Literary Criticism and Analysis class and fell in love with it. It really expresses a lot of magical realism and my favorite character is a great representation of Chicanismo, of which I was extrmemly excited to see some sort of representation of myself in literature.
Currently reading Ulysses by James Joyce for my English thesis paper.\nI also wrote a poetry book called Bones and Souls. :)
CAN'T WAIT TO GET YOUR BOOK AT MY DOOR
What If? Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions by Randall Munroe. A book on the list of Bill Gate's recommended  reads!
I recently read The Killing Lessons by Saul Black and loved it! Also the Broken Earth trilogy by NK Jemison is absolutely outstanding.
This year I loved A River Runs Through It by Norman MacLean. It has some great ideas and words in it, plus it’s short. You can finish it in a weekend.
What would be the chances that my preordered copy of turtles all the way down is signed? Is there a way to guarantee it? THANKS
Currently reading Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand, the true story of Olympic runner turned WWII bombardier Louis Zamperini. Absolutely riveting story of surviving against the odds
I just read an oral history- The Unwomanly Face of War by Svetlana Alexievich and it was fantastic!
I don't read much, I probably have a countable number of books I've read in my life.  But your enthusiasm for books makes me want to read more!
Love your books.  Have you read Plover by Brian Doyle?
Thanks for the book recs John! I just read Daring to Hope by Katie Davis Majors and it was absolutely beautiful. Non fiction reflection of 10 years as a missionary in Uganda.
Book recommendation videos are always my favorite. I would be pretty okay with a Question Tuesday, Book Recommendation Friday rotation.
Great recommendations. Currently reading Catch-22 and a biography of Hugo Wolf. Good luck with tour.
I just started Who Fears Death by Nnedi Okorafor because I have heard great things about her books.
Just finished Lord of the Flies... it was... interesting?
I love book recommendations from you! I end up finding my favorites from these lists. I always love expanding my personal library :) Thanks, John! Can't wait until I can read Turtles All the Way Down!!
THUG is my favorite so far this year, but reading The Hearts Invisible Furies and loooooving it so far!
John!!!!! You should extend your book tour to Canada :D
The vast majority of the books I read, and there are a lot, are sci-fi/fantasy, which when watching John's book recommendations makes me feel a bit... petty. Is it bad that I don't really like adult fiction or non-fiction?  Anyway I'm reading The Princess Bride for the first time and it's very good.
Read and enjoyed 'Not a penny more, not a penny less' by Jeffrey Archer
A tortoise part the way up.
Since when was John bestly sold?
Im currently reading Cathedral by Raymond Carter
I'm reading Blood, Sweat and Pixels currently. It's a series of chapters that follow game publishers along the life cycle of the games they develop. So far, I'm four chapters in and I'm in love with the narration and how complicated game development it.
TURTLES IN A WEEK
Nightfall by Shannon Messenger is coming out November seventh and I might just implode with excitement.
just bc i feel like saying it...\ni recently finished a book called Here Lies Daniel Tate Cristian Terrill. it's a YA mystery about a boy who manages to manipulate people into believing he is Daniel Tate, a high-society Hollywood boy who disappeared at the age of ten. the narrator-whose real name we never learn-soon finds out that his new family has some very intense secrets of their own. i finished it in a day and i could not stop reading it. i definitely recommend if you like mystery/thriller books. ik no one will probably read this but i just wanted to get it out there. thanks :)
I have Huckleberry Finn, two nonfiction books about the American revolution, and The Boys who Challenged Hitler. Currently reading the Inkworld series, a good one if you need a refuge in a fantasy world. I have a lot of movies I want to watch as well. If only I had all the time in the world for this!
Depression and other magic tricks, and our numbered days are two amazing poetry books I am obsessed with
It feels weird to say I've got my copy of Turtles all the way Down.  Apparently amazon.ca just couldn't wait any longer.  Thanks for taking the time to sign John!
im currently reading i hate everyone but you by gaby and allison and i freaking love it!
I'm currently reading Dark at the Crossing, by Elliot Ackerman
I’m reading the Disaster Artist atm
Hank and John, \n\n     I have a challenge for you. John, I know you love learning about other religions. I would love to see the two of you learn about the LDS church. Their roles in history/their church history. See what standards they hold themselves to and try to do the same with your families for a week. Look at the differences in between them and America's people today. Do a myth busters over rumors about the church. This isn't me trying to convert you through the comment section, this is a fellow nerd-fighter hoping that you can learn about them and through you others can learn about them. What's their cause? What do they believe in? A portion of people's ignorance about them can be cleared up through you. Two great sources for learning are  https://www.lds.org/?lang=eng and The Gospel Library app. These people are good with wonderful charities to help/serve and they shouldn't be persecuted so much for a lack of understanding. I think you will enjoy learning about them and from them.\n                                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                                                         -A concerned Nerd-fighter
My local book club is reading A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini. It's an addicting read and yet with every page, I feel nothing but rage.
JOHN THAT ONE LINE FROM WE ARE OKAY IS THE LINE THAT STUCK WITH ME FOR MONTHS AFTER I READ IT
Currently reading the Southern Reach trilogy by Jeff Vandermeer. It's this suspenseful Syfy mystery thriller. It is fan-flipping-tastic!
I just finished The Bedlam Stacks by Natasha Pulley and it was wonderful.  Thanks for the recommendations, I'll have to check some of these out!
dear John,  I know it must be terrifying to share something again, to open yourself up and make yourself so vulnerable. I know you will never please everyone but to take this daring step is in itself incredible. I've always loved everything you have written and I'm sure this will be nothing different though I know it doesnt make it less scary. take care of yourself,  I hope you are as proud of yourself as we all are.
i looove poetry. i just bought the sun and her flowers by rupi kaur which was released yesterday! i also loooove i wrote this for you. it has a beautiful mix of poetry and photography
I am currently reading Beartown by Freidrik Backman\nI am also finishing up Rick Riordan's 2nd book in the Magnus Chase series... both very different equally enjoyable
I got to go see Clint Smith and he was fantastic! I loved all of his poetry
2:07 I would like to see the movie.
Totally misread this title as “Let’s talk about boobs”. Damn.
IM SO EXCITED!!!! I talked to my school librarian and she said I'll be the first to get TATWD!!!!\nEdit: to add what I'm reading and loving! I read The Alchemist by Paulo Cohelo for my AP Lit class and although it has a slow start, I must admit I'm SO glad I didn't stop reading! It's a quick read, and a worthwhile one at that. I also read Milk and Honey by Rupi Kauer and Almost Perfect by Brian Katcher over summer and I must say that I loved both! I'm looking forward to Artemis by Andy Weir to come out and I'm super excited to read it!
I'm currently reading Numbers by Rachel Ward for my school's book club, but also William Golding's Lord of the Flies for English and One Dark Throne by Kendare Blake for fun
Thru hiking will Break Your Heart by Carrot Quinn is super amazing and a great insight on thru hiking the PCT\n\nAlso more YA kind of book but Gray by Pete Wentz has been a favorite of mine for a while. I'm rereading it for the fourth time
Soo... my christmas list is sorted :) Thanks, John!
I second The Man Who Couldn't Stop, seriously very good.
This made me so happy. I love getting book recommendations.
The best book I've read this year was, by far, Conquerors, by Roger Crowley, about the Portuguese expeditions to India in the early 1500's. A fascinating story of competing kings, espionage, technological revolution, culture clash and brutal violence that radically transformed the world.
A book that would make you shed tears uncontrollably and want to make you roll yourself into a cover burrito?\n\n\nA Monster Calls by Patrick Ness.
Currently on Annihilation by Jeff Vandermeer.  It's... engrossing to say the least.  Quite sinister, too.
I've started Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game series.
I've coincidentally seen the occurring numbers 333 in random places everywhere I go. So you can imagine how creeped out I was when I saw the video was 3:33 long.
🐢
The best book I read so far this year is A Tale for the Time Being by Ruth Ozeki. Great story, magic realism, trigger warnings for extreme bullying.
Best Nonfiction I've read this year:  Born on Third Base by Chuck Collins.  Also in the running:  Evicted (Desmond Matthew), and Words on the Move (John McWhorter)\n\nBest Fiction I've read this year:  The Bobiverse (Series) by Dennis E. Taylor.  Also in the running: Way of Kings (Brandon Sanderson), The Graveyard Book (Neil Gaiman)
The wealth of nations.
Scammin' for every book he can get his hand on. Lin-Manuel Miranda's Hamilton:\nAn American Musical
Try our Numbered days by neil hilborn for poetry. It is beautiful in its honesty
I am currently writing and releasing a story one chapter at a time as a blog. If anybody is interested in reading it it is a mashup between post-apocalyptic and medieval fantasy set in the ruined world of Freleria which met its end after a devastating war, a series of raids, a despotic king and a series of fires which raged for a quarter-century and buried the world in dust. It can be found a www.thedarkregime.com if it interests you.
Cannot WAIT to see you in St. Louis. It will be my first time at a book tour event!
Celeste is the best.
I adored The Hate U Give and I too believe that it will be a timeless classic for the ages.
Just started reading looking for Alaska. I don't usually read but I've decided your books where going to get me to start again
If you're looking for great YA fiction, I would suggest you read If You Find Me by Emily Murdoch - an exceptional book about society and family and trauma.
I’m reading What the Hell did I just read and highly recommend it
Can you do an entire book recommendation for books that deal with mental illness? Turtles All the Way Down and The Man Who Couldn't Stop are both on my TBR lists, but I want more modern fiction on the subject!
Terra Ignota series by Ada Palmer. Some of the best world building EVER.
I have always used words to try to convince the world that I am worth something I dont know why that hit me so hard, but man that quote nearly floored me
Currently I'm reading The Bone Clocks by David Mitchell, The View from the Cheap Seats by Neil Gaiman and Prinzessin Insomnia und der albtraumfarbene Nachtmahr by Walter Moers. Trying to finish all three before next week so that I'll be able to focus on TATWD.
I am actually extremely sad because you're coming to Georgia and it's sold out 😭😭. I'm 99.9% sure the universe has a vendetta against me because you are actually my hero and I have so many questions that I can't ask. Why?! Because I can't go😭😭😭
i am currently reading DAN BROWN'S ORIGIN, which is a great book and i am sure that you have read some of his books.
What no Children’s Book recommendations?
And I am getting the book a month after being launched- pre-order and everything :((( I can´t wait to read it !!!
NK Jemisin's Broken Earth trilogy is a painfully exquisite look into the kind of damaged societies we build, the struggles we can endure as people and ultimately a meditation on the value of storytelling itself.
YAY this was long overdue!! Thanks for this!
David Wong's What the Hell Did I just Read arrived on my doorstep today and I am so very pleased.
I highly recommend The Break by Katherena Vermette, a fictional work told in the voice of many Métis women with intersecting lives in Winnipeg, Manitoba. It brings attention to many issues faced by Indigenous women in Canada, including violence and racism.
I am finally reading How to Set a Fire and Why. Thus far I'm really liking it, though I'm only about 20 pages in.
I argre witg John and the hate you give. You care about the family and hope Kahil getting justice. You feel like a bystander in the familes life. After finishing the book i spent the rest of the weekend with my 2 best friend
NO!
Your tour reading is sordid?
Stephen King and Owen King - Sleeping Beauties.. #HailToTheKing
The Diviners x100000
In a sort of bizarre and entertainingly stagnant way, my general appreciation of literature was summarily squashed by studying it for a year in uni, despite the fact that it was the subject I excelled at most until I suddenly hated it.
I was at a dog park in denver about 3 months ago, 1 block away there was a gang shootout / driveby. I immediately ducked for cover and heard about 15-20 shots. My first thought was, I heard it so I'm not dead. My second thought was to keep cover on the mound of dirt in front of me and keep my eyes open looking for the shooter. I saw a car drive by fast as hell with four men looking sketchy as fuck, I made eye contact with them and was watching for guns. At this point I am running to get my dog to get out of there. What is every single person around me doing? They are just standing there saying, That's fireworks, That's fireworks.  Your ordinary person has no fucking clue.
Im in high school and was taking a break from hw to scroll through youtube. I saw this and felt the need to watch it. This is the America we live in. Literature, science, math: these are things American kids should feel the need to learn; the sound of gunfire should not be among them.
Not gonna lie Arma fucking nailed the gun sounds
I appreciate him making this video, its great, but jesus christ it's terrible that we need it. It's trending too.
step 1: live in America
How many civilised country do you know would have to do that kind of video?
Thank you for this video! I just had to call the police department because I wasn't sure what was a firework (who does fireworks in October?) and a gunshot. Thankfully it was just the first.
Thank you so much, I was just thinking, somebody should show what it sounds like and what to do.  You were professional, respectful and educational.  I am showing my college classes your video this week.  Nice work.  I would add the sound difference between fireworks and gun shots.
Sounded like the thud arrived before the crack but you said the opposite
What branch are you in?
All good advice except shining a flashlight at the gunman. I wouldn't do that.
The fact that this video has to be made....
I already knew this from arma 3
Sad that it has come to this but very informing, thank you.
Maybe - fire works should be removed from all concerts with a promise never to blow off any again!
Thank you so much for this! I'm going to share with all my friends so they can learn too!
I cant believe someone had to make a video like this! A gunshot has an extremely distinct sound from anything else, no matter how close or how far away you are from it.
In a situation like this, hiding or running both have their dangers. During events like this in the past, attackers had planted bombs near the exits, which would harm anyone attempting to flee. When fleeing, you are open to gunfire and susceptible to trampling by other victims
Its kind of sad to think that this is a basic necessite now in america. Kind of scary as well.
This is very helpful. Thank you for enlightening us
There was only one shooter.
Thank you lots for making this video. Is this available to share on fb?
This is one of those guys that jacks off to camo and tactical gear, but doesn't have the balls to join the military, even in spite of insisting getting mandatory haircut.
IMO should've explained cover VS concealment and their importance.\n\nConcealment: Obscures/hides an individual from an assailant. Can be virtually any type of physical barrier, a car, thin walls, or even bodies.\n\nCover: Protects an individual from the incoming projectiles.\n\nCover is preferable, but not always available, in such cases where it isn't concealment is a friend. It's much harder for a shooter to hit what they cannot see.\n\nAlso, while doors and trunks do not stop bullets, engines will. If you're seeking cover behind a vehicle preferably do it placing the engine between yourself and the shooter.\n\nOh and because it wasn't addressed here is the order of action in an active shooter situation:\n\nExit -> Cover/Concealment -> Fight
It's hilarious that this is trending. This isn't going to help you if a dude carrying a machine gun starts mowing people down, you're just gonna die. But hey, instead of trying to solve the problem, let's just learn how to run away from gunfire, maybe when your school/concert gets targeted next you'll recognize the sound that killed you. LOL
This should be number 1 so the everyone knows
SO MANY morons on facebook and youtube claiming that there were more than one shooter because of this sound barrier effect.
Sounded like a heavy gunfight in Iraq what happened in Las Vegas
When you live in a nice neighborhood i can understand people not knowing what gun fire sounds like. The main different from fireworks and gun fire is how fast the sounds are together and fireworks tend to have a sound after the explosion like a sprinkle or a slow fade. From the footage it was obvious it was a automatic weapon after the 8 rounds went by so quickly. A shooter with a handgun will tend to use 4 or 8 rounds before pausing with a semiautomatic. Living in the hood i recognized the gun fire right away having come from the suburbs i had to train my ears
You should really take this and do a commentary about all the videos you can find and explain each sound and thud from the Las Vegas shooting. I would love to see it
America ...the dumbest county in the world .  You dumbshits say you need guns to defend yourself get in all the shootings in past 50 years nobody responded with gun fire except the police .
If You have to take cover behind a car, get behind the engine.
I think this is the next serial killing shooter
Why were u getting shot at?
HaHaHa ... whilst every honk and idiot in the US can buy military grade weapons these kind of advisory vids ar really necessary :)  US needs no ISIS to kill themselves.  NRA-idiots and idiocy :)
Very well spoken. Interesting, and educational video
As if knowing what gun fire sounds like if gonna help you if you’re getting ambushed.
You don't need to watch a 7 minute video... If you think you need to run, run
Compared to False Flag videos you are tame. Deja Vu Jet Lag.
I'm so used to hearing the gun shots in movies that I didnt know what an actual one sounds like. It sounded a lot like a BB gun to me.
This should be played in schools
I live in a time where i needed to watch a video on what it sounds like to be shot at.
maybe police can use laser to blind the sniper/shooter..
I think you need to explain in more detail the spread in the speed of sound (1125 fps) vs the speed of a rifle bullet (aprox. 3000 fps)
thanks for the video. Sad that we have to watch this in modern society not in a war zone.
I strongly suspect the scenario at .17 is the reason that nobody I know wants to take me to the gun range.
thanks for the video
5:48 Since the engine block is the basically thickest and most complex part of the vehicle, it is what you want to hide behind. The bullet will deflect off of the various parts within the block and keep anything from exiting.
Really useful stuff. Imma have to look into this stuff more to better identify gunfire.
Thank you for the helpful video. Am sad it had to be made. 😢
Teachers show this to everyone for like 20 mintus
Well done brother.  However, some people are more audio visual learners.  Could you integrate more of these to enhance the info you just gave?  Could you also show us the difference between fireworks and gunfire or even a balloon popping?  There are people that like setting off what sounds like M80s.  There are some people that may tune out of what you're trying to say if you don't give more interaction with your explanation.  Maybe, give some background on where certain names came from...such as a report(from a rifle).  Otherwise just put things into simple terms.  ☺😇
Gun runners some shooters will lure you out by puase but have ammo left in the clip
3:30 you must have the worst aim in the world or video game logic to miss getting hit with the bbs from the shotgun and still not know what was shot at you
Very well spoken, I will share as much as possible!
Yeah I noticed while watching those shooting footage videos, a lot of people just didn't understand  what was going on at first because they didn't know what gunfire sounds like. A lot of people said they thought it was just firecrackers. And tbh they were just there to have a fun time at a concert so it makes sense that they didn't know instantly, especially as they weren't expecting something like that to go down.
I need to see more of the video of you being shot at. I need to understand wtf happened!
Thank you for this I've been sharing this with loved ones so they know how to asses a threat and get through it as safely as it can
They should play this in schools
Sad that something like this has to be made
The world has gone mad...we have to learn signs of mass killings in progress so idiots can keep guns.
This is true. I know from being a contractor. My tv was left on OAN channel. They played the sound of gunfire on the news channel. I was sleeping on the couch. I heard the gunshots at low volume and woke up at 2am in the morning. The original news title was 20 dead in shooting. I thought I was in a dream at first. I went back to sleep. The title changed when I woke up later to 50 dead in shooting. I am an extremely sensitive sleeper. I can never go into full rem sleep with the TV on.
Great video\nBut how does one shoot at someone else accidentally? (Like you were shot at)
It's just sad it's gotten to the point to where people feel like they have to make these kinds of videos now.
One of the most disturbing things about this particular shooting is how so many people were blissfully unaware that they were being fired at.
Your a good man the more informed people are the better off every one is
you did great bro tnx i recored it and sharing this on my channel
Napoleon dynamite in the thumbnail...a freakin 12 gauge what do you think?!?!
*THIS IS REALLY HELPFUL. MORE THAN JIMMY KIMMEL. GUN CONTROL KILLS. YOUR ADVICE SAVES LIVES.*
Really appreciate the info!
Good video💯
nice trick
Thank you sir.
Fuck everyone who dislikes this video
Gun control won't fix this... 96 people DIE every die from Cars in the US. That's 96 families losing a loved one from a Vehicle! Every DAY in the US but nobody wants to talk about that. also Alcohol alone kills more people in the US every single day! than Guns do. Cigarettes Kill over 300,000 people a year in the US alone. Why don't we ban cigarettes? That is 1,000 US lives DIE every DAY from Cigarettes!!! but nobody wants to talk about that... then  1 psychopath out of 330 million people get the constitutional rights stripped from all law abiding citizens doesn't make sense and it will NOT stop terrorist attacks criminals don't obey laws. All its going to do is leave criminals with guns and the American people disarmed during future terrorist attacks.
Oh look another youtube comment section that is filled with cancer
Only in america you'd need to be taught what gunfire aimed at you sounds like in order to go anywhere and not be killed. \nBut muh right to bear arms.
Look at the Democrats who clicked on this video just to give it a thumbs down, without even watching 10 seconds of it. The left is so full of hate.
Fucking America and their guns.
You look like a young Dr wells from the flash, in a good way 😆
How to solve the student debt problem, Bernie.\nhttps://youtu.be/DfYDkVlPUag
How to recognize gunfire... Just look around for creppy looking fucks like this guy, driving questionable vehicles like rusted out astro van or out of commission ice cream trucks and shit.
What a dork.
You know the worlds fucked when you have to watch videos like this.
People don't know what guns loud like? Are you blind?
No step on snek.\n\nFucking retard gun owners kys
And its sad but true this is why I hardly ever go out in public, growing up my mother warned me about public shootings/violence but I never realized till now how serious this is and it is much more common in this age. It is sad to think todays kids or teens, my daughter included, will not be able to have a normal childhood (go to concerts, movies, etc.) :/
street gangs just got smarter
Best way to engage an attacker when you don't have a firearm? The most I usually go out with is a knife, but a lot of people don't even carry those. In the event of a shooting, running isn't going to save anyone but yourself, I'd like to know how to neutralize an attacker in a mass shooting scenario.
Fucked up society we have when you need to watch a video like this so you don't get shot at and die just for going to a concert.
haha stupid americans just ban guns.
nothi Nothing wrong with video good job make more videos like this I almost went that movie theater in Aurora and always thinkin Maybe I should have gone out there and run him over don't.  i olso say in this take courage be ready to take the bad guy out, be on the look out, peolpe if you see something say and do something before someone hurts others. remember  People hurt other people they use guns, people are evil don't forget that. ( the  Truck plows into a crowd and kills people NO  is He they terrorist, person with the world view that's twisted and evil he killed people).
Not only do I know the sound but I can also tell you that he was shooting an AK47 out the window.
Where do you live bro?
If you notice, the closest these Gun Guys ever get to combat is a firing range or Call Duty games.  They just like to dress up and play soldier but they never seem to have the balls to enlist and actually go to war.  You never see actual veterans getting hard ons for guns after they come back because they've seen real war.
You should make a video explaining why banning surpressors is dumb because the shots are still very loud.
America: Should we ban guns to keep mass shootings from happening?  Nah.  Let's just teach people what it sounds like when they're shot at so they don't get murdered as often!
So sad that if a Muslim kills 1 American he'll described as a terrorist , but if American person kills 500 people he's not, FUCK MEDIA . That's so dumb, wake up people ,(( RIP to the 59 ppl who get killed))
Oh for fucks sake.. how fuckin retarded of you dumbass.. YES, LETS NORMALIZE gunfire sounds to people and make them fearful of every thing under the sun.. you assholes act like this happens on a regular basis and it doesnt.. FUCK YOU pumpkin..
Don't tread on me?! lol How about gun nuts stop treading on others? How about gun nuts get their nuttery put in check. How about instead of training people to recognize gun shots, we eliminate the need to recognize them. How about we put on our big boy pants and realize it's time to change our ways. The American gun culture is sick. How about we administer the remedy and tread all over them for a change. lol Don't tread on me. HA! Who's getting tread on in the LV videos?
No one give a fuck
For everyone saying she got her lips done look at her photos from fashion week Ker lips are normal
This commercial seems to be more innocent than people are twisting it to be. If your automatic thought is racism, then maybe you're the racist. all I saw in this commercial, what I CHOSE to see was the fact that something so simple can bring people from all sorts together. This isn't a hate commercial. Seems more like everyone is really sensitive.
Kim  ''This is the first time you had a scandal''
As a British person who doesn't know who this girl is I would just like to say god bless America!
Instead of empathizing with those that felt this was wrong, the chosen approach was to cry and make this about her.
why should anyone feel stupid for cracking open a cold one with the boys ?!!!
MAYBE SHE JUST NEEDS SOME PEPSI 😂😂
everyone: “THE PEPSI COMMERCIAL IS SO OFFENSIVE!!1”\nme: “yeah ok but why though?”\neveryone: “......... THE PEPSI COMMERCIAL IS SO OFFENSIVE!!!”
This was so funny I shed a tear
What was wrong with the commercial?
How did it affect anyone though?she just gave some geezer Pepsi and fucked off
Fucking kardashians thinking they are so cool \nWhat's the difference between my family and there's \nNone \nThey are as average and boring as us \nThese twats get money for just living for no fucking reason \nDo I have a 10 Billion Fucking Mansion No\nDo I look like I have had so many Botox injections I look like mickey Rourke No \nWhy am I not famous \nBecause they are Totally interesting\nFuck them \nI have more of a life than those kardashian cunts
I don’t feel bad. You looked at the script you saw what the video was going to be about, yet you went with it. Cry me a river but I wouldn’t give a shit.
To all the people defending her, I think people do have a right to be offended. She appeared in an ad that did take the topic of police violence a light topic. So people are gonna get mad that she thought this ad was okay to be in.
Oh for God's sake leave the girl alone!
Oh life is so hard for you!! Bless your Armani socks !
honestly, kendall, people were not offended.. but why the fuck didnt nobody thought the symbolism of trying to use minorities concerns in the US  showing them just doing stupid shit in the streets, trying to sell the ideogram of capitalism  ( coca cola, pepsi)  in the hands of a very privilege girl that is the epitome of  vanity and everything wrong in entertainment... might be STUPID!!????
Her apology is so fake and pathetic.
Now let’s make a Las Vegas ad
She didn't even apologize 😂😂😂 all she's worried about is how dumb she looked to the public. What a joke
never have i heard her apologizing for the things she's done, only her playing the victim
What was so bad about the commercial?
the world doesn't care you are being picked on because it's fashionable !
Utter scumbag! \n\nLook at those poor crocodile tears with all the money she has raked in from Pepsi. Yes you just cry with all that money you have you attention seeking cash whore!
Bet she wasnt that sad when she was cashing her pepsi cheque. Looks like it paid for her lips 😂
LOL, this feels like so scripted for tv. Why this shit is trending in UK youtube is rubbish.
Guess she didn't take Kim's advice and own up to her mistakes, she just stayed in silence and continued to act like a spoiled brat having a pity party for herself.
This lot could milk  a Rock !!!!
The Pepsi ad wasn't even bad😂you're all too fucking sensitive
im boycott the e network if they dont cancel this fucking show. i just came here to say this
Cry me a fucking river
So since she was a part of she the ignorant bitch? But none of the other hundreds of people in it are? I think she was so excited because Pepsi asked if she wanted to be in a commercial wouldn't  any of us be excited?
At the end of the day she STILL makes way more than you guys make in a day! 🤷🏻‍♀️
I liked the ad. her giving the cop a Pepsi acknowledged that he's a human being too
Umm here was a mass murder a few days ago.. let's try not to worry about some pathetic over privileged celebrities.
Cool what acting classes is she taking?
honey this is months too late
looking forward to day this fucking family fade away like a bad case of the clap\nalways looking for sympathy all the time\nwhoever looks up to these idiots needs a good smack around the back of the head
Why are people lying like if they were gonna get paid 1000 they wouldn't do the commercial ? Foh .
Was my first time watching and thought who gives a shit lol
Why is it such a big deal
Someone PLEASE tell me what was wrong with the advert.!
I mean... there is some real negativity in these comments. Especially around 'who cares' clearly you because you watched the video. Why does everyone need to be nasty nowadays?
Oh no she wouldn't hurt anyone on purpose... Remember this TS thing.... This fam is a bunch of liars
I literally saw nothing wrong with that commercial. People are just WAY to over dramatic, y’all need to take a Xanax or something 😂
To all the people this is relevant to.. Please get a life.
Someone should have gave those shooters in las vegas some pepsi.
First time you've had a scandal LMAO
Sounds like she needs a Pepsi.
Really, Pepsi is at fault. She is just a paid model.
She's a model, not the producer. Tear them down and not her
Meanwhile in Africa. Oh the problems these plastic people have. The problems...
I don't know if I blame the Jenner/Kardashian family for being so stupid and tone deaf. You got a group of girls who have lived in a completely different world than the rest of us and have no idea what life is actually like and what is really going on in American politics. Listen, they all got famous because they are rich, stupid, and have ton of plastic surgery which makes them perfect for all the idiots who love reality tv. Why such high expectations? Isn't the whole idea behind their appeal is that they are so far from reality that we watch them like some form of circus freak show? Personally, I hate reality tv and had not heard of the Jenner side of the family before this happened. I knew that there was Kim Kardashian and that she had some sisters but I didn't know their names. I watched the Pepsi ad and thought Yep, that seems about right. I had low expectations as these people are only famous for being idiots, so why all the hate? You are specifically hating them for the reason why you all watch them in the first place.
The ad was a moronic piece of shit that should not exist.But crying over it is just pathetic.I've never respected you because of how you make a living, the type of person you are and your family.But the respect levels are In the negative now.
I'm just waiting for someone to do a leave kendellll jenner alonevideo #leavebritneyalon
Did she have lip injections?
Didn't she tell Kylie not long agothat her lips were too big? I think she said Nobody needs anything, everybody is beautiful. Right...
u should,,,,,,,, have a pepsi
Who the hell cares
Like ever...you said you would not offend anyone..THEN WHY CARRY ON MAKING YOUR DRIVEL GARBAGE TRASH TV SHOW..GO AWAY
She deserves everything they throw at her. Thick bitch !!
What the fuck is wrong with me I clicked on this shite!
I don’t even think the advert was THAT bad... She’s getting way more hate than she should. She did the job, she got paid. End of.
Kendall,go vegan if you don't want to hurt anyone.
How would you not know that was bad idea.
And why do people care about this?
I clicked this vid just to say boo hoo. I stopped watchin after she said she felt stupid. Basically summed it up
And still she makes more money then y'all lol
She has a bloody brain... did she not think to read through the script beforehand?
What the fuck is this crap. Everyone here can go fuck themselves
Crocodile tears lol
no...kendall... your lips.. I mean, whyyyy:(
Give em a pepsi
Drink a pepsi
Poor thing <4
Grow up
Famous for fuck all useless fuckers
Kendaaaaaall 🤗

Great video can everyone check out my little boys football channel only six years of age if you like subscribe please
There are two types of people....
They’ve ditched Land Rover, they’ve ditched James, they’ve ditched singing? Apple have massacred this once funny and different show. Awful.
0:03 i know thats all you do and soon the only thing you use to do
The best driver is dead.
I love these two !!!! 💗
No Carpool or karaoke?
So this replaced the original car karaoke with James?
Oh ffs it lives why can't it die on apple music so it can come back to youtube
What song is playing when Tyrese drives?
how can they call this Carpool Karaoke if there not doing any singing james needs to take this back
Tyrese looks like he's gone full fast and furious
Apple can suck it 😑 even though I’m watching this on my iPhone

thank you Casey for calling that monster what he really is, a Terrorist. not that 'lone wolf' bullsh*t. \nGod Bless To All The Victims of This Tragedy
Great cause but blame your currier government, from across the water facts don’t add up, for sure people died but not by a long shooter, this was planned by the lefties groups  in America
Awesome stuff Casey! What about a gofundme page to fund gun danger awareness and lobbying movement against the NRA promoting the sale of military grade guns??
Very good Casey !!! Thats very thoughtful of you mate !
“One flys high not by himself but with the help of the wind” We all need each other....... Thank you Casey for all that you and others do to make this beautiful world even nicer.
Thank you from Las Vegas
You are the man Casey! This makes me so happy you are doing this.
how can someone dislike this video, please tell me, i try to understand these retards.
Blame the government I don't believe this one bit\n\n media knows to much already in a few days
I donated blood today for the Las Vegas victims.
Pray and god ain't enough. At the end of day you still hungry. You can't pray to not be hungry. \nYou need action.
The world is a dark place that’s for damn sure
If some of the men in this world, especially US, were a little more secure within themselves they wouldn’t need even bigger guns as an extension of their penis to feel like a big powerful man.
Thank you for doing this Casey.  You have a great soul.  Just think...if all your subscribers just donated even $1.00.  I know you will do the best with the funds you raise.  Peace to you and your family Casey.
Felt the same way in that order! :”(
what about Puerto Rico they can actually use that money to save lives.
Thank you for calling it what it is.. TERRORISM. We have to understand that terrorism is any person who attempts with the life of a group or others. It seems that our president only thinks is terrorism when the perpetrator is Muslim or from a minority group. thank you, Casey, ​for been altruistic and using this platform to help people.
Blood offering as it's best. Satan loved the blood shed.
He wasn't a terrorist he was just as bad as one he just doesn't fit the definition of terrorist
casey is such a beautiful soul
Because you know so many victims, huh? What bs. You sure your not a girl, dude? So emotional. Gimme $? Wtf? Douche...
I just got back from PR but i have two team members there - there are people in the mountains of the east, west and central that are dying.\n\nWe have done search and rescue in TX, FL and PR and we just cant do it by ourselves any more. Is there any way you can contact me and maybe help us get the word out?\n\nI am in Myrtle Beach South Carolina and am trying to acquire satellite coms and enough supplies (food and water) to send one private charter back over and the rest by container so i can get back to help my team. Initially we found 500 people stuck in the mountains ESE of Anasco and were hard pressed to get anyone to help - we are starting to gain momentum but after the Las Vegas incident - PR is old news to people . We get messages and phone calls daily of loved ones stuck in the mountains and bodies decomposing as they've died due to starvation and dehydration.\nWe started a non-profit called \n\nWeCan Disaster Relief and Recovery and have had a very small amount of donations.\n\nI am not asking you for money - i am asking you for any type of assistance you think you can help with.\n\nThe news is not telling the story and my team needs me back there to help ASAP. \n\nMy number is 843-340-2110
You guys have to ban gun.
Thank you Casey, my cousin was shot in the leg in the shooting, went to surgery and insurance only wanted to pay part of it
This is a serious topic here in the comments section__-- don't laugh and don't comment bad if this happens with your family then you understand ....but i hope it do not happen for your better... Life...
Go Casey!!!
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas
What a meme
Can you run tho
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.

Wow! \n\n2k dislikes
thanks from Vegas <3
Rest In Paradise Mom 😔😢🙏🏻
oh damn glasses off.
Great Video Bro!
i really like u and ur channel but i feel really disgusted seeing people even talk about money at this early time....stop giving money so much power over human lives,....ur talking about replacing a child’s lost parent with money??? cant u just help them any other way than replacing it with money??? DISGUSTING REALLY!!
How can a country that permits its citizens to be armed not be prepared for the fallout by providing universal health coverage for its citizens? The GoFundMe campaign shouldn't even be necessary but apparently it is :\
Way to go Casey. You are a true gentleman 👍🏻
Let this be your wake up call to get your weapon rights (2nd amendment) sorted and move the rifles and pistols out of Walmart. Please get together for some actual change or things like this will only continue.
This just shows how insensitive the fucked up world is before we can watch your video regards the shit in vagas big advert of loads of shootings on the advert no 1 really gives a fuck how stupid who ever put that advert on guns of glory advert something  shite
The goverment did it how stupid are u
Really, trying to capitalize on a tragedy?!
You know you could help by campaigning for stricter gun laws but no thats silly to think of you cowards giving up your precious guns :)
If all of his subscribers donated A DOLLAR, 4 QUARTERS, 100 PENNIES ETC. THAT WOULD BE 8 MILLION DOLLARS RAISED FOR THE VICTIMS. DONATE EVERYONE!!!!!
BAN ALL GUNS WHEN WILL AMERICANS LEARN
Nice and good for you for doing this and Casey I do respect the hell out of you.  But we have heard this all before. A massacre happens. People say how saddened they are. They pray. They talk about how things could or should change. It’s in the news for a week.  They give money. They move on. Then the next one happens.  Being from Australia I’ve visited your country numerous times and think it’s the best place on the planet to visit and have a genuine love for the people and the country. But there is an underlying disrespect most of the world hold for you and it’s this.  True action is standing up to your politicians and saying no more this has to stop. True action is saving the next potential victims of such a barbaric and insane action like we saw in a Vegas.  I’ve read a few comments about true action from you on this platform saying to make a documentary about how the people could infect change. Now that would be amazing.
We saw more here than what is being told in the media. The scenes that night I will never forget. Don't believe everything mainstream media is telling you. Listen to the ones that were here witnessing ALL the events unfolding
if there is good people in this so are the bad people
Why is the answer to everything to throw money at people???
Medical bills in cases like this are covered by the state I've heard but yes something should be done to help these families
look at good ole casey. just willing to hop on a massacre and acting like a good guy for the views and relevance, classic
If every state had at least a few thousand snipers none of this would of transpired.
What is the definition of the terrorism? \nI mean killing 5 people is terrorism or killing 500 people is the terrorism? \nShould American band gun culture?\nAfter reading all comments. We must make definition of terrorism.
I want Casey to be fastest YouTube growing channel🎥 keep on vloging. JONATHAN 😁👍
And people believe this guy? Inb4 he takes all the money
Good thing
did this video get demonetized?
Terrorist?? Do you know something the FBI doesnt?
Gods Promise:   God didnt promise days without pain, laughter without sorrow or sun without rain. but God did promise strength for the day, comfort for the tears and light  for the way. And for all who believe in his kingdom above, he answers their faith with everlasting love.\n\ncase, you are truly a special one!  \n\n(credit:  A refrigerator magnet)
for the first time I feel bad for watching youtube with adblock
You could do that or.... fight against the guns market!! The US government is responsible for it!
Very good idea Casey. People will need counselling, therapy, funeral cost to be paid for and not having to think of working if your family or yourself is going through this is good if you can help. Let's all put a little and it will mount up.
Way to be Casey, way to be.
Thank you for saying mass murderer and terrorist. That's what it was terror. Saying adjectives only gives ways for excuses to NOT say terror....
Nevada.... A not ah! Nu! va! duh!\n\nThat is all.\nP.S. \nCasey, you are an amazing person and i love everything you do brother, God bless.
Pray for Las Vegas. :( and big THANK YOU for Casey Neistat
I’m not even a subscriber Casey but I love and respect what your doing. From UK. 🙏🏻
Genetic fewer recent rent few individual sometimes monument repeatedly threat
Finally, some one who is doing the right thing instead of blame throwing.  You are a good man.
Don't get me wrong here Casey, I have respect  that you want to help them but giving them money to me doesn't seem right...\nPersonally I wouldn't be very happy if a family member got shot and didn't survive and someone would bring me money saying 'im so sorry'\n\nOf course I get that you want to help but this to me doesn't seem right...
The hospital bills will be enormous. Send monies to help the ones with no health insurance please.
Good job Casey I like how you care for others man congrats 🤙🏼
Money can help the victims but it can’t stop this from happening again. Nothing can. But banning guns will certainly help.
do not donate to them until we actually find out people were killed. this could be another hoax. idk if it was but it was definitely another false flag attack we all need to look more into this.
If you want to help the victims then use your platform to encourage Americans to support tougher gun control laws.
This is why Casey is one of the best content creators on YouTube
Bluh bluh bluh America will do nothing keep their guns it will happen again and there will be another video bluh bluh bluh
They don't need your pitty Casey go play with your toys
Why couldn’t this guy have been in the crowd?
Isn't that terrorism?? Or only terrorist attacks is associated to a specific religion only?! Every killer is a psychopath until they affiliate themselves to that specific religion then they become terrorists!? I'm just wondering really because media seems to brainwash people minds very easily these days.
so unreal..
puerto rico needs actual help.
Casey is God
This f****** opportunist
🖕🏻🖕🏻💩🖕🏻💩🖕🏻💩
me name jeff
How about banning guns ....?
Casey is employed by CNN.... and they’re quick to politicize this.... Please show me where you’re efforts are in the mass shootings in Chicago? I noticed that 60 people died there from black on black killings in September ..... but Casey you’re not talking about that!!!!!  BECAUSE it’s not on ur political agenda nor does ur employer want you to discuss that specific problem.... Keep in mind Chicago has very STRICT guns laws.... which aren’t being enforced.
Now the people that are racist to muslims feel bad because its not muslims are terrorists
oh look he's piping up again to cling to relevance.
He isn’t a terrorist, it wasn’t for political gain. Get your facts right
But GoFundMe takes an 8% cut.
Why don't you donate your money instead of asking those with much lower incomes to donate.
Stay tuned for this name will become famous YouTube\nDo not hesitate to subscribe to the channel
I think money for those victims is not the right thing to do. It think those hurricanes victims would need it more!
well said terrorist no other way around it...
HELP!? they are already fucking dead fcking using tragic event for views FU!
Hey #VIPs & #NotificationSquad!! So, I'm gonna be honest..

Yooo!!It's a tender coconut...:)
Its a piña colada inside a coconut cake..😀
I have made a number of cake horror stories, first one was when I was like 9-10 baking cupcakes, I mixed up the baking soda with the baking powder, well they tasted foul... others are when I've been older, like 25+ and I have run the gambit from taking the cake out of the pan too fast and it cracks in half, to hot days melting my icing, not dowelling my cake and  it collapsing or falling sideways, and my saddest was all my 50+ handmade fondant roses melting off my two tiered engagement cake... I had to fix that one quick for my brother... ganache and ferrero rocher's saved my bacon on that one
Coconut ?
I was sure I couldn't possibly love you more, and then you went and made a portal reference. I don't even know what to say right now.

#Cakebookquiz it's a Coconut cake 🌴
Yo definitely make top notch looking, perfect cakes all the time... But unfortunately this is the first where I'm gonna say is half way. At least only the front part of the pencil. It just doesn't look as pointed  and abit wonky and the tip i thought was suppose to look like a cone as well, and not like a mechanical pencil lead thats straight.. The end is gorgeous. I'm pretty sure it isn't as easy as it look though.. Just my 2cents. Love ya Yo!
That cake I think was a coconut

please remove numbers from combat
Are the PC specs out yet?
please turn off the numbers when you hit someone  😕
I absolutely cannot wait for this! Every vid I see on it makes me more and more excited! Long live AC!
Take my money and give me that game right now
imo, theres too much control on that arrow, arrows turning corners is just -- wat.
Damnit... This video just made me drop $60 on the pre-order. The hype is real!
I wanna be hyped but the last AC game that was properly optimised on Pc was Rouge please do a good job on Pc i really want to love this game but i still can't play AC3 to this day on PC cuz there's 20fps in cities
The number hitpoints that appear above of the ai's head are just too big, they need to get rid of it or make it smaller
BTW,can I aim the arrow at the guard's private parts as I please?Just like we do in sniper elite?
we took a 2 year break so we have more time to copy and paste from other developers
I only have 1 issue with this game. Where are the damn corner kills?! Petition any1? Other than that.. game looks sick
I have ever seen a game like this 😎
I just wander if you can make the arrow fly in circle forever.LOL
Did they change the controls again? As soon as this series went to Colonial America, they changed the controls for no reason and it sucked. Did they change them back to the original version or something new again for no reason?
I wish they made the climbing more interesting than just climbing anything effortlessly and at unrealistic speeds. It feels extreme in this game. I don't like being reminded i'm playing a game in games like these. I want them to be immersive -- To inhabit the world and interact engagingly and believably with it. That's what I loved about these games, but they seem to be going in the wrong direction to me with some elements of this game
Sorry to burst peoples bubbles, well not really. Any how, the truth is that no blacks were not ancient Egyptians. Recent research (yes it is true, look this up people, don't believe, listen and look up, believing in superstition is bs, same with the concept of belief, that's why we have science) has shown that indeed ancient Egyptians were not blacks, instead that ancient Egyptians were more closely European. However knowing that production of the game was some tike before the recent studies, the representation of ancient Egyptians will be inaccurate, or simply for diversity sake, yes it is mostly the first thing, however we've been going backwards for so long in the games story that we've skipped eras, so it's probably as well that they did his for diversity sake.
You can control an arrow, but cant pick up bodies?
My only concern with the predator bow is not how unrealistic it is but how overpowered it looks. I'm afraid it'll make the game too easy.
Nothing is true, everything is permitted
controllable arrows . that is ridiculous .
Looks like their combining a little bit of Metal Gear 5 and Skyrim stealth.
They should have done controlable throwing knives instead of arrows if you ask me
Please tell me you can get rid of the stupid fucking points that come up every time you kill someone. It looks like they took it from borderlands or an arcade game
Can Bayek kick in Fighting in Battle like Run fast an  fly kicks Medjay Warrior kicks combination of kicks in his Medjay Fighting Style The Medjays Also Train in Different hand close combat like fight kicking his way out fights that what This Game is Missing Can Bayek do combination of Kick Moves while Fighting in Battle Incredible Epic
Why is there no cover system?
am i the only one who thinks that moving arrow is stupid?
For the most part I'm not a big game purist, I'm not sitting here saying no, it has to be like the old AC. In fact I love most of the new things. But I just can't get behind the controllable arrow. If they give a legitimate lore reason as to why you can control an arrow mid flight, then I'll accept it, but I'll probably still never use it. Feels like cheating to me
so no PC on 27th ?
Senu distracting the guards kinda reminds me of DD from Metal Gear Solid V :D
wtf were they thinking with the controllable arrow, this feels so wrong
Everything looks amazing but I think it'll be hard getting used to controlling an arrow.
Where's Blood Dragon 2!??!
The stupidest thing is that you can no longer kill an enemy with the hidden blade if your level is lower than theirs. Makes no sense
October 27th you say? I just so happened to book that Friday off work, and subsequently the following Monday.\nHell yea.
AC Origins PC version is going to be a bad joke of the year.
Ivaras navigator lmaooo y is that in ac 😕
The feeling when your favorite game of all time turns to this..
Love it can't wait
I dont want to say it feels like MGSV because MGS has some Assassins Creed elements as well, and I love both MGS and A C, but this reminds me of MGS V for some reason lol.
Can you guys release it early for my birthday which is the 19th
Why not PSVITA ? Come on guys! I’m still enjoying Liberation
i love it how you stab him in the side and he turns (the longer way) to your front xD AC IV and never again ubi$oft
I am in Love 😍
UB copy-pastes itself and calls it  New Stealth Gameplay. Eagle-tricopter (all last games) hovering in the air in one place, poison (all AC), taming animals (last Far Cry), burning of something (Far Cry), controllable arrow (some bull****). What is new, UB? New bags, new drawdowns of FPS, new graphic of old ACU in decorations of AC4? Maybe big uninteresting  from the viewpoint of gameplay map? Parkour for a tick, blind enemies, incredible and impossible underwater combat? This list of new in gamplay is very long. (P.S. Are executions from For Honor?)
I mean the controllable arrows are kinda cool
Many people complainer about the guided arrow; personally, it looks amazing
Everything looks amazing! Hope it will be as great as AC 2 :)
The combat looks fantastic. I can't wait. From what I've seen Ashraf Ismael knows exactly what he's doing. I hope he heads the rest of Bayek's trilogy.
Dat AI
Controlable arrows? Wtf???
Excellent.
Heavenly Sword?!
No double Assasination?
Stealth is life :D
Far Creed Origins :v 1:53
Chris Watters!
take out controllable arrows please
looks amazing asff
Mgs anyone?
It looks amazing!
THAT CONTROLLABLE ARROW,LMFAO
Nice
Jean Guesdon je t'aime !!\nVous avez fait mon assassin préféré qu'est Edward Kenway ! Je sens que je vais adoré cet épisode !
Hopefully the controllable Arrow isnt uses like the remote Control Batarang in the Batman arkham Series like Ehen sou played ans hated it 😂😂😂💩
hate sleep darts they are so overpowered. hopefully they have balanced it somehow but i doubt it
The controllable arrow is a lot like chameleon ability from syndicate, a feature that a lot of people will avoid
I don't know what type of gamer pros you lot are I'm gonna need that controllable arrow anything that helps me in game
What a shame theres the same kill move all the time with the hidden blade but anyway this game will be fun
Can u use your torch to light your arrow
And still.... almost ten years past... I think the first installment is the best one. (Just an opinion, not the 'truth'. Not looking for an argument).
But why the remote arrow?!?Just why???
That controllable arrow looks like it was added to the game at the last minute
Really just one stealth kill animation? Cmon, or you’ll add more with dlc? I’am hyped about new combat but honestly stealth doesn’t look good at all.\nEDIT: personally not gonna use phantom bow, for me its just too much xD
So many haters in the comments - HILARIOUS!  1.  Why are you even here?  2.  Don't play it!  Anyway, 22 days to go!  I really can't wait to play this...
How  realistic is that bow!?
Im afraid about stable FPS on standard console PS4 and Xbox
I'll never activate such skills as this predator bow... Too weird and easy, for the noobs only...
This looks fantastic! Man, the AC series has come a long way. Loving the new stealth system. :D
I love this game just because of Ashraf Ismail, he seems so pationate about this
I do HOPE this game comes OPTIMIZED!
Why so much hate on an optional bow n an actually innovative game. And are ppl complainingly about a bow in a game of aliens,pieces of eden n animus software trickery.
Very cool predator arrows.
Finally Stealth  Baby !
Thank you Ubisoft ❤😍
Can’t wait
I love Assassin' Creed 1,2,3,4,5,6
So the controllable arrow is just like the rocket arm from SNAKE from *Metal Gear Solid: Phantom Pain*
I already pre order the deluxe edition (ps4) .
God look at all that stuff in the M rating.😍
I'm on board with the controlled arrow but is there *any* attempt to explain it logically? Even if it's assassin magic, just any explanation plz Ubisoft
They've made it like the witcher 3, which ain't a bad thing at all
ну и говнина, хуй сосите со своей игрой
if you think that the game is a masterpiece, you idiot. Remember how ubisoft was praising their games: ac unity(at the output 20 fps in the game), the division(the same situation), Watch dogs (graphics worse than promised)
Steering the arrow is ridiculous. That should never have been a thing. That will permanently stay locked in my tree
Seriously? Still no cover Animations in a stealth game. \n\nAnd after assassination kills the Nov just falls straight through Bayek?\n\nSoft cover in this game looks like you crouch down staring straight into a wall. Look at the last of us if you want a good example of soft cover. Even did it fairly well in Syndicate. Why is it gone???
So a homing arrow is too much but a Pope with an energy manipulation staff, a Master Assassin who can make 20 of himself with a magic ball, an alien super civilization and an eternal reincarnating mad sage are totally fine????.... Go pound wet dirt with your unrealistic arrow comments guys
Please add freeroam
The controllable arrow is realistic. The arrow is blessed by Anubis.
THE NEW COMBAT SYSTEM IS HORRIBLE!
SUCH a cute little video, lady! <3
This is beautiful and will be something wonderful to look back on in the years to come because you capture more than just the motions of life in your videos. Good work.

TOO SHORT D: Thanks for the upload <3
bro what i was so surprised when it ended!!!!!! XD
I'm so confused. So litterally, i'm on the other side of the world, and this video is made 9 hours ago which is at 1 o' clock my time. That means, this video is made in 4th and 5th Oct 2017?
Oh, if you could see OUR autumn in Russia. It's really snowing now in my town.
So when’s this movie coming out? :D
Marzia, your hair is so beautiful blonde!
okay, your outfit and your makeup were absolutely GORGEOUS in this video!! have you done a tutorial on that look because if not I would love to see it!
This girl can honestly take a shit, sell it and make a profit out of it. Smart
I think all the beauty in the world was born in Marzia. Lovely girl.
I find it hilarious that all around the world season changes are a huge deal because they are so drastic and  pretty but in Mexico City is:\nSpring: A little less rain\nSummer: Rain combined with suffocating heat\nFall: StOrMs (help)\nWinter: Rain and fog\nAhh Mexico... How I love you.
Her aesthetic is so pleasing. Does anyone know where the lights at 0:45 can be bought and what their brand name is? -Or anything similar-
I love you're outfit so cute!!!
why is this the most calming thing i've ever witnessed
this video is really calming ,and i know the cup/mug brand :)))) i follow them on instagram :)
As someone who lives in the UK, I must say this ...where is the rain? Lol.\n\nLovely video, all the same xx.
Nice video I liked this video yes!!!!👍😅
Beautiful colour scheme and composition
I hope it gets cooler here soon, (southern California) today was 85 degrees! Its hard to get in the fall spirit when it feels like summer still lol
I swear to god, if I was a guy I would be slowly falling in love with her😂
The most aesthetically pleasing videos are made my Marzia. Beautiful ! 😍

あーー。なんだろうめっちゃ落ち着く...✨\nこれがマルツィアさんの凄いところ！センス良すぎ笑
Ciao Marzia! Mi piacciono tanto i tuoi video. Trasmettono serenità :)    Continua così. Un saluto da una fan italiana.
hey look at me im marzia i love my life im so cute i have lots of expensive toys and vacations to replace my lack of a personality and no im not depressed and completely empty inside
I only tend to binge if it's a certain show. I binged a lot of the OA because I was completely hooked. Other shows I try to do one or two episodes at a time to save it. I've binged stuff in the past and then been sad that it was over so quickly.
I was super disciplined when I watched Freaks and Geeks, I watched one episode each night before I went to bed to make them last. It really helped me de-stress after a long, confusing, and tiring day of freshers. But I thought there were three seasons, so I thought I would be able to keep this as my holy grail switch off time for ages. There is only one season. I have one episode left to watch. But I'm too scared to watch it, cause as soon as I do, that's it... it's over. I'm saving it for a special occasion. Or least until I've found a new series to save me from the abyss that is having nothing to watch.
I binge for two kind of opposite reasons which is weird... Like, when I was unemployed I would binge because I had nothing to do. I had nobody to stop me sitting there and binging all 6 seasons (it was 6 at the time) of Game of Thrones if I wanted to. \nNow I binge because I'm busy with uni, YouTube, friends and family. I can't know that I'm going to be available every Wednesday night. So I'll save up some episodes and binge them all at once. Or better yet, with Attack on Titan, I'm waiting till I have a spare weekend and I'm going to binge the whole second season. (That only works with stuff like anime though, because if it was something like Game of Thrones there would be too many spoilers.)
first thing I binge watched was Lost. I think we do it or at least I do it, because its a better way to experience it. You are 100% into the story and the world when you binge watch. Only one episode a week is limiting. I prefer it when it airs weekly because I don't have time to binge watch and im too weak not to but the experience is enhanced when youve spent the last 7hours inside the same universe.
I binge on shows but I because I spend so much time in that world and with those characters I end up getting tired of it. Loads of shows have 4+ seasons and I've noticed that I become a bit of a tv commitaphobe.  It just becomes predictable or the characters/plot get annoying. It's probably why I tend to prefer bbc dramas.
I don't watch TV, but I do watch youtube for hours
The only things I can fully binge by myself are things that don't require much focus so I can multitask otherwise I feel like I'm procrastinating, so like Pokemon (yea I'm 2 decades old and what that shit's great) I watch while I'm doing the practical side of my costume course, and the best one actually was when I had to pull an all nighter to finish a piece of costume jewellery in time for presentation the next day so I stuck The Mighty Boosh on, got through every season and finished at like 7am just in time to pack everything up ready for uni... The result was a really feckin surreal bus ride after Noel Fielding's mind had become my normality
Have you seen Harlan Coben's The Five on Netflix? SO GOOD. I can't believe nobody is talking about it... I lost an entire day to it and I don't regret it.
I'm one of the weirdos who watches TV as it airs, it's always been something that we've done as a family and it feels wrong not to, there always seems to be a drama or comedy series on and we tend to plan our nights based around TV, e.g. We have nothing to watch on Thursdays so homework/housework/paperwork can go on uninterrupted OR we can go to bed earlier on Wednesday and watch that show Thursday. While it's amazing when you can binge a series I still quite like the wait for a new episode, it keeps my attention piqued and helps to get my brain going - since I've not watched it back to back I have to pay attention. I do tend to go back later and binge the entire series in one go but with a little brother and A levels for me spreading things out works better with schedule, especially when I feel like others are relying on me being done so THEY can watch TV. \n\nI also really miss the water cooler effect, talking about TV was the best fuckin thing and now it doesn't happen, major regrets.
My only way of watching shows is through binge to be honest, my job is pretty full on 5 days a week, sometimes more and obviously on my days off I try to make plans with people I haven't seen in months because of my job, so I miss a lot of aired shows, so when I find time (9/10 at stupid o'clock in the morning) is when I actually be able to watch the shows I plan to, my to watch list of shows is near enough impossible to accomplish at the moment, I don't have time to sit and watch aired shows because I'm not at home when they do 😂, but yeah that's my reason on binging, this might be interesting it might not to your points on binging but oh well 😂😂
I binge watch so much! I hate it when social media spoils it. Depending on the day and the amount of a level work I have to do then I will watch all day
My first binge was Charmed box sets about 9-10 years ago. I like to think I've come a long way since then...
I watch things sporadically, usually a couple of episodes back to back but I don't think I've ever watched an entire series of something in one go
I can never do more than three episodes in a row bc I get restless and bored, no matter how good the series is :/
It's weird but I find that the length of one episode defines whether I binge something or not. If it's under 30 minutes, yes. But any longer like 40 or 45? No. I can't do it. It either has something to do with my existentialism or attention span. I get bored or feel like too much time is passing. But watching 4 twenty minute episodes feels fine, but not 2 40 minute episodes. I think it's that feeling of accomplishment. But then again, I don't know shit.
what's interesting is how some shows are different when binging - I mean, they clearly were made so differently. Like ER - that is an amazing show, but watching it without commercial breaks is irritating, because they roll back the scene and you are watching the same thing over and over again. That used to be a thing, but it's not anymore. There are also some of those that are so intense it's frustrating to watch, again, because there isn't a commercial break to lighten the tension.
I'm definitely a binge watcher! I wait until the whole season is our before binge watching it over a weekend... i guess it's because you can get enthralled in the series and can feel all the emotions because it's fresh in your head. Sometimes if the series is really good i binge watch it (so i can talk to friends about it) and then go back and watch it again at a slower pace to really enjoy it more... i did this with Riverdale
Absolutely love your videos where you chat about films so it was nice to hear you chat about TV shows as a change 😊 I’m definitely a binge watcher but then I also like the anticipation of watching one a week! Depends on the show I think 🤔
hold the phone. Catastrophe isn't an amazon show. I watched all of season 3 then went back and watched seasons 1 & 2 thinking that the next batch would be ready for me soon enough.
We used to go to the pub and binge .  .  social . .  ness.
The only series I sort of binged is Stranger things, in two sitting. I'm not really a binge person, for some reason I can't bring myself to watch more than 2 episodes of anything consecutively, though i'm not watching anything as it airs either... i guess i'm just a slow watcher in general
Restraint? Ha! I laugh in the face of restraint! Well I mean I would if I could see it, all I can see now are bright, rectangular lights.
Why doesn’t it say that it’s sponsored in the thumbnail?
You have to disclose that this is an ad in the title. Great video as always :)
I think you skimmed over impatience - our society and lifestyle is so fast paced that we've lost a lot of patience and I think that contributes to why we binge.\n\nAlso - Jack, have you ever watched the Spiderman cartoons? They were a part in my childhood and I've definitely binge watched them at some point.
my concentration is just not enough to binge watch an entire series, i usually give up after two or three episodes
Yeaaaah I sometimes find binging exhausting to the point I get bored with the series. I unfortunately did that with the last season of Orange Is A New Black but then there are shows like glee that I spent all of my free time on. So I don't know the rule but I guess sometimes when the series is too long it's better to watch it with a little breaks just to enjoy every part of it 😆
I find it fascinating how socially accepted it is even though we use the word binge. Binge is usually used to describe illnesses e.g. binge eating or binge drinking. I'm doing my dissertation on binge-watching and the psychological effects it has on our behaviour so this was an interesting video
We've all been there
i usually binge stuff on really busy days, when I have a lot of chores around the house like cleaning or ironing clothes, repetitive chores you don't have to devote a lot of brainspace to. but it's usually an easy show or audio book i listen to, that lets you not be 100% concentrated to it and not miss anything. OR I binge stuff on days I feel bad or sick, but then I need something more immersive that doesn't let me think and tune out, so my mind is occupied. otherwise, I'm not a fan watching an episode per week, because I feel it waters the show down
Honestly, I don't binge tv shows. Not because I restrain myself, but because if I watch more than 2/3 episodes (depends on the show and length of episode) a day my brain gets so full of that show I'll constantly dream about it at night, to the point that I'm half awake and kind of rewatching the show in my head, and I'll spend all day thinking about it too. So I just don't watch too much of a show, generally :'). \n\nBut maybe 2-3 episodes a day is also bingeing? It is compared to watching 1 show a week, but my friends will sometimes watch 8 episodes a day when they like a show so compared to them, I'm very mild. When are you really bingeing a show? How many episodes within how short a timeframe would be bingeing?
first thing i binge watched was the simpsons like i used to collect all the boxsets from second hand stores and sit there and watch entire seasons. mostly i now bingewatch when doing something like cleaning or studying as 'background noise'. its actually quite hard for me to be at home and not have the tv or my laptop playing something as i tend to feel immense boredom
my first 'binge' was Heroes. All my mates were a few eps before the finale and raving on about it, so I caught up with them so I could have something to talk about.
I would be so annoyed if my sister watched prison break without me.
I watched the first seven seasons of RuPaul's Drag Race in about two or three weeks
I think the first thing I binged was iCarly when Nickelodeon did a marathon of it haha
When you're bullimic and constantly ask yourself this
I have no self control, jack #bingeall
I take issue with the spoilers bit, you yourself did that one twitter with Game of Thrones on an episode that I had not yet seen which you then ruined  part of the plot of. If you are going to be critical of others Jack, don't be hypocritical.\n\nThanks\n\nA viewer
I am not good at binge watching on my own... I get distracted easily... but doing it with a friend or my parents, no problem!
I'd almost always wait for the full season to be released and just binge because I'm sort of impatient when it comes to series especially if they have cliffhangers at the end of each episode like I ain't tryna wait a week to find out
Throwing in a bit of media theory in there eh jack? I’m just so pleased I got what you meant  😂
I one time watched the first season of PLL in one sitting. Like 22 hours of content. It was a bet with my friend to see if we could do it (she watched it with me) but yeah. It’s simultaneously the best and worst time I binged something 😂
Certain shows that I watch are too exciting to only watch one episode at a time, it's like a book you can't put down, but we don't refer to that as binge reading
I was a little confused before this started, because I thought this video might be a talk about mental illness
I make sure to always have a few series that have episodes coming out every week as well as some series I can binge watch simultaneously. So that I have some shows to look forward to, but also the option to binge whenever I feel like it.
Net neutrality out the window. Did you even think about what you were promoting before you accepted the money for it? Pretty poor from you.
My friend trinity does this thing where she is convinced that she suggested the show to you. Shows like oitnb, 13 reasons why, stranger things and atypical. She is convinced that she told me to watch all them and gets a satisfaction from it. So the only way to let her know that she hasn’t persuaded my tv show choices I must watch them when they come out. Forcing me to take a day off school every time Orange is the new black releases a new series.
My bingeing keeps getting more and more ridiculous - just finished all 102 episodes of Suits in 3 weeks (highly recommend btw for anyone considering), and already looking for the next thing. It’s kind of strange but I like having something there in the background to ... fall back on? Like, if I’m doing the ironing, or I’m having an early night, or there’s a long journey ... I like integrating a show into my life, which probably means I’m missing something else right now, but yeah. It’s strangely comforting and I’m trying to find something to fill the void right now haha.
this season of GoT was the first season i've watched as it aired and really the only show i've watched live and it was so much fun, i loved going to work and everyone had watched it\nbut realistically unless a show is a hugely popular as GoT it's not really possible for the 'water cooler' conversation to work anymore? at least not by episode i don't think
I agree with what you said Jack and that study is so interesting! My partner would never get away with getting ahead of me in a show we are both watching, my mum is lucky I didn’t lose it when she got ahead of me in Outlander so yeah wow! \n\nThe last thing I binge watched was Wynonna Earp (finally!) and I did two seasons in two days now that was the last thing I binged and that was about two weeks ago and binged Defenders two/three weeks before so I do monitor and manage my bingeing but I’m always hesitant on shows because if people are like “Yes watch it, it’s amazing, you’ll love it!” I won’t like it as much, happened sadly with House of Cards and a few other shows and I’m quite a hypocrite too because I say that to people so I don’t blame them but I find it so interesting that, that is how my mind works (and possibly others) and the lifestyle that watching television is now! And I love it but living in Australia has its negatives with American tv because we have to illegally download or wait for DVD or until Netflix puts it on. So in Australia (and I’m sure other countries) Freeform’s Shadowhunters had its episodes uploaded weekly to Netflix so I could watch it, sadly once a week but now days time flies so before you know it you have one day before the new episode. \n\nBut anyway great vid! 👍🏻👍🏻
I have had restraint with rick and morty purely because i didnt want there to not be anymore! Its taken 2 weeks but im finishing it today, its my birthday so why not? That my friends is my restraint maximum😂
I think I use binging as a form of procrastination
Me, when all episodes of a season come out all at once I don't watch/binge them all at once. I will watch one or two episodes a day until I'm done. The only thing is, I don't like it when people spoil it on social media before I have finished!
My problem is that I get easily distracted. I can't watch more than one or two episodes at a time (and those have to be 30min episodes I can't deal with those 1h long ones) otherwise I'll get bored.
I do it when stressed tbh, so the amount is increasing daily
Yeah ex, why would you watch season 2 of master of none before season1?! I was asleep on the sofa, woke up halfway through the Italy episode, we watched the entire season in a day and then missed the last 20 minutes of the final episode... worst way to watch anything ever!
i like to binge shows ive already watched anyone else do that? like im currently doing that with Supernatural (tho stopped cause two jobs now ugh)
Netflix was designed around binge watching. Whenever you finish an episode and you're like, alright that's enough, it'll be like, look at this next episode!
I love to binge watch series because this way I'm much more involved into the story and world instead if I just watch one episode a week.
Been loving your channel recently Jack!!
noone talks about binge reading. We binge read the harry potter books because they were a constant cliffhanger.  Binging is human nature it is a deadly sin (gluttony), but you cant die from too much Harry Potter or Stranger Things.....I hope.
The first several shows I binged (like you before that was the word used) I watched them on DVD, but on DVDs from the library, so I'd only have a week before I had to return the entire season, this was of course back in the pre-uni days when I had the time to watch a whole season in a week. Now I rarely watched shows as they air, there are still a few I record, but I'll typically watch them an hour later, because then I can skip through the commercials. I know I binge because I get impatient and want to keep consuming the media I'm enjoying
When I was sick in bed for a week with pneumonia, I watched a season of a series each day. Best guilty free binge of my life.
Why we Binge is an easy Question! It is because we want NOT TO END the Thing we like!
My aunt and I talked about binge watching recently [esp. with Game of Thrones] and realised that if you watch too much TV in one go, it's either too exhausting or you gradually lose sense of the potential complexities or nuances. Having rewatched s3 of GoT - 10 hours in two days - was exhausting which makes sense.\nI tend to watch two or three hours of TV any given day if I'm watching a show over a period of time. Occasionally I will watch more and lose track of time, so...Whoops.
i watch my shows on my own because my SO doesn't have taste in shows...
No restraint until the last few episodes, then I have almost limitless will power... I waited almost two years between the second last and last episodes of Deadwood because I couldn't stand the thought of having no new episodes to watch.... Maybe that's not restraint though
Jack Howard is a  Tottenham Hotspur fan spurs on there to wembley stadium come on you spurs
Personally, I do tend to have quite a fair amount of restraint when it comes to watching shows, especially on Netflix. For example, when new Marvel Netflix series come out, I tend to limit myself to one a day AND stick to it, it seems to give me just enough suspense to wonder what will happen next, but I'm not left waiting too long that I forget the last episode. I have been known on occasion however to erm... break that particular rule haha! Sped through the new BoJack Horseman as quick as I could! I do see both sides of the supposed argument though and I don't think there's really a wrong or bad side. Just comes down to personal preference! :)
The first series I really binged was Avatar the Last Airbender. I got hooked and had to watch it all before the finale came out. Lol
I just plain forget, so when I go to watch it there's a few eps waiting for me and I'll have binge to play catch up before I'm distracted by life again.
I don't... Get binge watching? It took me a month to watch Sherlock (before season 4 was released) and I still haven't finished season 2? 3? Of black mirror. For me, I need time to process every form of media I consume. Black mirror, for example, I watched Shut Up and Dance like months ago and I still haven't started the next episode. This goes with books and movies as well. People binge watching Harry Potter? Can't do it. People reading 7 books a month? Can't do it, even if I did have the time. I think for me, binge watching kind of takes away how much you appreciate the art of it all.
I thought I was the only one who got a little hurt when my partner watches shows without me
i have so much homework to do, but its the holidays and i plan on binge watching something today
You look like an egg with glasses and pretty great hair
Lol i thought this was gonna be about bingeing as in... Having an eating disorder lol i guess thats just me
I also binge to destress. The more stressful the day I've had, the more episodes I consume. But I can only watch on t.v series at a time? Committing to more than one series at a time stresses me out.
I hate binging, I stop enjoying it more than 2 episodes in since it gets old, binging just feels like filling time
I like to binge but when I do I start to binge too much because when I finish a show I then go and find the next show instantly which just leads to misery but I definitely prefer watching things as they come out or at least the same day or week because for me personally it's better because it doesn't consume all of my free time. I still think binge watching in moderation can be good.
It's a good concept by 3 to binge without data but if you read the small print your paying for TV channels and and adverts
I binge television that catches me I can watch shows slowly and take my time like with The Walking Dead but thats cause I stop to process things after watching 2 episodes normally but with the Netflix show American Vandal I watched it all in one sitting it just caught me with how clever it was and it was consistently entertaining whilst leaving every episode on a cliff hanger that made me want to watch the next one but not making me feel like I have to. If you haven't watched American Vandal please do it, it's a really cool show
In order to binge you have to have money to afford all the dozens of services they expect you to subscribe to in order to get your content... or find other means. You know, like watching through a neighbor's window. When I _had money_ and not a lot of easy access to basic cable for some shows I'd buy the DVD set and burn through that in a week/weekend. Being _poor_ and having only minor access to basic cable through someone else's TV or easy access to broadcast TV with an antennae I absolutely DO schedule my days around when shows air on TV because I HAVE to inorder to not miss and episode. IMDB's tv guide listing is a permanent bookmark on all my devices so that I can find out when to stop watching Youtube or Twitch... which both coincidentally also feature scheduled uploads and broadcasts at specific times that you have to catch at the time or you have to find 3 hours of your day where you'd normally be doing other things in order to binge something later that you would have watched at the time of it being live.
I feel like the reason I like binging is because knowing I haven't finished something completely makes me uneasy. For example I don't like reading a book in sections; I prefer to finish it in one sitting. I think it goes hand in hand with my need to know everything there is to know.
I binge watch stuff over when it comes out weekly because I find I remember the plots much better when I watch it all in one go!
liking just coz you referred to hazel as your 'lady friend'
its honestly bc i'm impatient and i don't like waiting to see what happens so i'd rather do it all at once and be like WOW THAT RULED
Dont you have to put ad either in the thumbnail or title of the video? Hate not knowing its spon before I click... Hazel did it
Matchsticks
high ur a-noy-ing
My lady friend 😂😂😂
Very interesting video
“My lady friend”
Procrastination - duh.
“My lady friend”
Personally I like binge-watching 'cause it feels like watching one ENORMOUS, AWESOME MOVIE. Like y'know, the type of movies we all low-key want our favourite books to be made into? Long movies that don't skip any details or character development? Love that. Also I think sometimes it helps if it's the type of show where remembering little details improves it- I watched Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency all in one go, whereas my brother watched it staggered over a few weeks, and he got stuff from the second watch that I got from the first because things were fresh in my mind and I made more connections/remembered more background characters. (Amazing show btw, please watch it if you haven't already, it's nothing like the original book but that works in it's favour since Douglas Adams' style isn't really suited to TV, it's kooky and clever and kind of a mess at first but boy does it come together.)
Funny you mentioned this.... I just found your channel a couple of days ago and I just watched all of your content... Everything since 2009.... Yep...
Restraint? That's cute. ALL AT ONCE
I don't just binge....i binge them at 1.25x speed with subtitles...... 1.1x speed if i love the show
I feel like a lot of people binge watch because in this day and age where everything is instantaneous and fast paced, our attention spans have gotten a lot shorter. Personally for me, it takes a lot of commitment to sit down and watch a movie/tv show series without doing anything else at the same time but once I'm watching it and really engrossed in it, it's hard to get out - almost like I haven't focused on anything properly in awhile. That's just what it feels like for me anyway. I'm sure there's a legit reason though.
This are my boys ❤ * proud *
This was an excellent tribute to a rock legend. May your soul be at peace Mr. Petty.
Thanks for this Tribute. Not a Coldplay Fan - but my deepest Respect. Greetings from Nuernberg.
So incredibly sad and heartbreaking. Thanks Coldplay. We lost a legendary singer, RIP Tom Petty. I made a tribute video of Tom. He was a truly great singer and performer. He sang til the end. RIP.
Not sure if Coldplay does this for every big name musician that passes but they did one for the Beasties MCA.
That was so terrible 🤢
Respect!! Love you cold play
Just saw Tom live in May this year. Glad I didn't wait. Thanks fpr the memories Tom. And im not a Coldplay fan but much respect to them for having the balls to do this last-minute tribute. They did a great job
He is FREE and making more music for the world above.
It was so wonderful to hear this. My wife and I hugged each other through this whole song. So glad I was able to take her to this show. It meant a lot on an otherwise very shitty day.
He fucking butchered this if you cant sing that high dont try to
Essa música é show! Valeu Tom Petty! Siga sempre na Luz.
Lovely...teary watching this...Tom Petty and The Boss wrote the lyrics to my life growing up...
Where’s the bass notes?
Thank you for sharing that.
Fantastic tribute to Tom Petty.\n\nGreat work, Coldplay.
Too many Goodbyes. Too much to take...
I hate Coldplay, but this is alright!
Tom Petty one of the best nobody did it better now your really free rip thank you for everything
that was such a fucking incredible concert. i can now die a happy man. i truly never thought i'd get to see coldplay live. thank you guys for everything. coldplay has seriously changed my life for the better
I wanna go to their Concert at Rose Bowl this October 6th but no one wants to come with me due to the shooting in Las Vegas.
I was there! SO GOOD! It was SO emotional - they came out very solemnly, asked for a moment of silence for Vegas, then went into Free Fallin'. It was SO emotional! <3 <3 Love them!
Thank you Coldplay.  You are a good band honoring a legend.  I can't believe Tom is gone, it was like he never aged.  Anyone who didn't like his music was no friend of mine.  I imagine him meeting Elvis, Jackson and half the Beatles and imagine the jam session.
Not a Coldplay fan but a very nice cover & tribute.
shout out to Coldplay great tribute to the great Tom Petty!!!!....R.I.P TOM
Most emotionl version of Free falling I have ever heard. I am so heartbroken over the loss of Tom Petty, his music has been the soundtrack to my life. He was by far my most loved. I cannot believe he's gone. RIP Tom :(
I was there, and it was absolutely incredible. Chris is such a great guy :)
RIP to everyone lost their lives in last few days
a  aweosme tribute to Tom Petty...oh my wht to  say about Tom    just a man  of  many great songs   reminded me lot  of the  Bob  Dylan  style,,, i   so remember  all  of   his videos  this one   def sticks in ma head,,   RIP Tom you will be missed!!!!!
Not hitting the high notes but lovely tribute anyway.  I miss Tom Petty already.
RIP rock legend, Petty's the greatest.
Loved him and his music.  I listened to him for 40yrs.  He was great in concert.  Better to have seen him once, than not at all.  RIP
I SAW MY HANDS IN THIS VIDEO
Rip Tom Petty ,wonderful music over the years.
Chris Martin - star choice song for a legend x
Man, you can't do it :)
Mad respect for all of you on stage and fans. One more light just went out...
there are my hands at the 2:44 marker.🦋🦋🦋
Ah wonderful. Looks like a really special moment. Lucky Portland. Miss you Tom Petty.
Two major losses in 2017 with Chester Bennington and now Tom Petty... RIP legends.
Nice! ;-(

Heff wanted company up there, and who better to share a space in heaven with than Tom.

GREAT TRIBUTE...
That was an amazing concert last night and a wonderful tribute to a rock and roll legend. RIP Tom Petty.
Rock the heavens Tom. You will be missed. 💋
That last part gave me chills, man.\nNo, I'm not crying right now what are you talking about
I was at this concert
Thank you Coldplay. Loved Tom Petty - long may his music live
Wow, what a sad shock. Love ❤️ you.
Grown ass men all over are shedding tears unabashedly.
Tom has touched everyone with his music. RIP
What a legend Tom u were ur songs are beautiful I'm so sad all my heros are dying that I grew up wit
I guess he learned to fly when he got his wings R.I.P 😇😇
What a beautiful tribute. This is amazing.
Knocked it out of the park!! Great tribute song. R.I.P. Tom Petty. You will be missed, but your awesome music lives on.
Who is cutting all the onions here?
It took me almost 20 hours to grip that Petty passed.  Laying in bed crying my butt off. I love all musicians.  Listen to  Leave Virginia Alone written for Rod Stewart by Tom. Go see Rod while u can.  Seriously.
R.I.P
Well done, Coldplay!!
Good guys
thank you!
Major Respect Coldplay!
Much respect!!
Amazing! RIP Tom.
Yes😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭👋

IM SOOOOOOO SADDDDDDDD
October 2, 2017 absolutely terrible day. Fuck!
FALLIN' UPWARDS

Tom ,I .will miss you.RIP
RIP tom petty.
Nicely done, Tom is smiling.
THANKS
Rip Tom Petty
Nice work chaps.
Awww :( Tom
que lindo  espacio que deja la gente  , en los conciertos afuera, , para poder llegar  hasta el borde del escenario   :)     en Argentina eso no pasa   :)  :)    ;)
Peter buck is the man!
Good stuff, gentlemen. I'm only 30 but my parents were heavy rockers and Tom Petty might not have been the voice of my generation.... but I was born about 25 years too late. It hurts.
Stop disrespecting by butchering the death people song. You have done enough, Chris Martin.
Coldplay always have to be the bride at the wedding and the corpse at the funeral,take a back seat you egotistical fucks
This video raises the inevitable question, is there any corpse that Chris and the boys won't fuck the shit out of? That lumpen drum sound, the guitars lacking in any kind of feeling, the walking vagina and embodiment of middle class liberal guilt Chris 'the plagiarist' Martin, unable to hit the fucking notes. Had he even heard this song before? When this bunch of washed out cocks die they'll no doubt release own posthumous tribute to themselves to grab a few more quid from beyond the grave.
Nice sentiment but poorly executed.\n\nTHERE IS ONLY ONE TOM PETTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nRIP Tom!
I hate Tributes swimming on the wave of fate for PR. Guys you going too one day don’t forget that! ColdPlay 👎🏻
awesome tribute! PS- Go check out John Mayer's rendition of it (the live version)
i guess coldplay won the race to sing the tribute first
most attention pathetic seeking band going. licking Gallaghers arse at Manchester and he can't stand them and now ruining an already shite song
Recipe to a successful Buzzfeed show:\n-1 lively,  bubbly host: Steven, Ryan\n-1 sarcastic, less bubbly host: Andrew, Shane\n\n\n\n\nI love Worth It & Unsolved <3
2 of the chefs were black...
think i'd be awesome if they did one with Ramen/noodles.
If you cannot afford fried chicken pick up me for $5 your brain will be fried by the time you finish me
Are they not full?
This show is the only thing I like about buzzfeed...
The red rooster guy won chopped man I’d trust him
Red rooster? Oh forgot they weren't in Australia, red rooster joint!
last one was more like chicken tacos.
I don't think I've seen Adam this emotive before. He's so adorable, but this episode, between hand holding, drooling and giggling, I think he really enjoyed this trip.
is anyone else a fan of the song playing in the momofuku segment?
I can't keep watching this. I am making pools of drools.
@0:10 Whats robert dinero doing in new york passing around flyers ???
when they all held hands  ; v  ;
i literally just got back from the gym and seen this. fam you cant do this too me.
red roster is a fast food chain in the land of upside down
i love these three guys XD
This video made me crave fried chicken so bad all week.
I love them two together
Lol red rooster is a franshise of roast chicken in Australia 😂
It doesn't matter what you serve. In NYC it's going to be more expensive than in a small town.
red rooster deadass a chain restaurant here in australia that no one buys
Keith must be so sad :(
my god i love adam
Korean fried chicken is the best who agrees with me
Marcus Samuelsson is a judge on Chopped lol
Just realized I was sitting next to the Red Rooster guy on a flight. Small world. Haha
How come they didn't send Keith from the Try Guys on this mission? 😭
Cringe when Steven talks about his sex life.
3:40 Adam is the greatest
Finally a Worth It video with a restaurant I've been to lmfaoo 😭😂 I love Sylvia's ❤️\n\nEdit: I just finished watching the video .... and I'm hurt lol
can someone tell me how old adam bianchi is??????
lol Andrew is so negative
not flavor time unless Guy is there assholes!
Wait, is the red rooster fast food restaurant in Australia only?
Yo... sylvia's is right down the block bro,
andrew is the type of guy who leaves ur message at 'seen'
They call me red honey in school\nWho called you that? \nNo one\nThats sad
BIRD BIRD BIRD , BIRD IS THE WORD
Im ethiopian too berbere is so good
So the united states eats almost the entire population of the world if people were chickens every YEAR. i've never been more proud to be an american.
If they went to red rooster , they should have tried kfc too. Both of them are fast food chains or Is red rooster a fast food chain in Australia?
is anyone else mad that he didn't take keith ?¿
Who else is drooling why they eat the chicken😂?
Make an episode where Adam replaces one of U guys for the day.  Thumbs up if U agree 👍 👍
Word to the bird. And like that, he's gone.
Wait... Red Rooster is an Australian chicken chain... Guess the copyright didn't move to the US!
pls subscribe to our channel and pls tell people about us
ICE CREAM VS ICE CREAM \n\n\n\nYOU NEED TO TRY IT SJKSSL
I need this chicken!!!\nAdam is so adorable XD all the hand holding
i'm diet. why do i watch this?
How dare you waste all that food and not give me any 😑
You should've asked Keith​ to come along
Adam jumping in and holding both their hands was too precious
who the F pays the restaurants for all this stuff....like, do the restaurants really just throw away a $500 can of caviar just to be on an internet show?
Red Rooster is a fast food place here in Australia lol
My name is Marcus Yeoh I am a cook I am 5-Star cook
i really want them to eat somewhere and hate it
try to serve those drums coated with caviar to gordon ramsay
I could take over 1000 words describing how I felt about this episode. 3 amazing restaurants with amazing chefs (2 are friggin famous.) This was an amazing episode and I'm quite jealous of you guys @ Momofuku. David Chang is an amazing chef!
Although, all these fried chicken looks (and probably taste) so good, I'll just be cheap and order some Chinese corner store fried chicken wings.
You reviewed FRIED CHICKEN and you didn't even call the CHICKENWATCH GUYS??? Injustice! You didn't even rate the chicken on sexiness. 🤣
you guys know you have a lot o chinese viewers? If you could have chinese sub in the future that will be great.
You should have brought Keith from The Try Guys cause he loves fried chicken
I hate these fuckers. All of them
I've been obsessing over all those Chopped After Hours Youtube videos this past few days and so excited when Marcus Samuelsson suddenly appear!
I'm surprised that Keith didn't come.
Chicken so good he looked like he wanted to light a cigarette xD
I don't eat that chicken I eat chicken nuggets from McDonald I am a steak person
Where are the vegans?
jesus is a cornbread let em sop you up
This episode gave me horrible flashbacks to working at KFC
why are all the owners of fried chicken restaurants black...
what kind of chef takes ur food?
These videos always make me hungry...
The problem is that if there is well known bloggers or critics the restaurant treats them specially
That black guy sounds like that black character from rick and morty
Andrew is so cute tho 😂😂😍😍😂
How about BROWNIES ?????
The Hound approves!
even 17$ fried chicken is extremely expensive
KFC is better
15:00 Adam eats every single caviar
anyone hungry while watching this
Beijing duck😂
try some vegan foods
HIGH CHOLESTEROL, HELLO HEART DIESEASE XD
omg Marcus Samuelson!
ya'll should try Jollibee chicken joy 😂
Do pork belly next
where is KFC😕?
They are disrespecting caviar
winner winner chicken dinner.
Steven cussed! #Waitwhat
Do wings
Sorry, but Roscoe's Chicken >>>> Sylvia's
STOP EATING!!
Always feed Adam.
Tea worth it
Nachos!I mean pls
O Brasil se entristece com essa perda. Mais um rockeiro amado por todos q se vai. Os  céus se alegram com sua chegada, Tom. Aqui sentiremos sua falta.   : (
Fuc dude. Its kinda weird cuz my parents went to one of the last three concerts he did about a week ago. Like they just saw him on stage and then a week later he died dude. I think its safe to say that this fuckin sucks. Fuck.😓
From all of us American Girls, who dream about there being more to life than what is offered to us...thank you Mr Petty for your brilliant lyrics and endless life sound track....
thank you.\nthank you.\nyour songs is my treasure.\nR.I.P.
Six, six, six the number of the beast.

Rest in Peace Tom Petty (1950-2017)
Rock and Roll heaven just gained another great one.  We will continue to celebrate you and your wonderful songs and music <3
I had tickets to see Tom Petty and the band for a special show next week, I wonder if it will be canceled?
He already looked so aged, and this was fifteen years ago. Somehow his passing makes sense. RIP
Mary Jane's Last Dance \nI hear Crosby, Stills Nash & Young, The Beatles & Dillon Wow!!!
Thank You Tom Petty! \nWhat you've left us will rock on in our hearts, in our souls, (& in our ears! ;-)
My fave song. I just loved his sound. It is unique and never be copied
You really did break our hearts this time :(
Thank you for being the best road trip companion a girl could ever want!  nothing beats rolling down the windows, singing American Girl, open road ahead
Every American boy's dream:\nOh yeah, all right \nTake it easy baby \nMake it last all night \nShe was an American girl\nTom, you were the American Boy for me. RIP my brother
I miss him :( this is just makes me cry💔
too much early go away Tom!
Rip
RiP #TomPetty
Agradeço de coração o trabalho realizado por Tom Petty nos final dos anos 80 com a banda The Traveling Wilburys. Suas músicas ficarão eternamente em meu coração. Que o Pai Celestial receba sua alma com muito amor.
[']
Eight of us travelled 6000 miles (us 2 in an RV) to see Tom Petty and The Heart Breakers at Red Rocks,  May 30th, 2017. Not sure we'd do that for another artist. RIP Tom and TY.

Comeu.
Just keep posting episodes....u r my inspiration
Ela tem feat com ele?
Thanks for the moment of silence it means a lot
Couldn't even make it a full minute...
I stand with Las Vegas, much love from Glasgow, Scotland
are you a short WWE Superstar??  ok, we need you in the back
yo
Wow
It is so confusing to see a arena with people that are completely silent ...🙊
Peoples were saying jinder mahal was also there ....where is he...???
I'm starting to think that dislikes on youtube are automatic... like who can dislike something like this???
Where's sin Cara!!! Is he still in WWE?
What's was the tragedy that happened in Las Vegas (L.V)
May God give peace to their souls who are died in that Las Vegas attack 😔😔
Can you do a fight brick vs challote
Why would people dislike this
what was Shane doing on raw
its funny how they try to make it all look real and make it seem like guys actually dislike eachother in wwe then everyone suddenly a family for things like this.I am not saying them coming together to support vegas is wrongs i am just saying its quite funny cuz next monday you gonna see reigns spearing cena and sstrowman
I'm surprised Alexa broke character for once
I always like moments like these, mainly because I like to compare superstar heights, and damn it looks like Gallows is taller than Strowman here.
Why is shane on raw?
Roman front an center next to vince, showing what a suck up he is
World class this is, fair play
*SHANE, YOU'RE EXPOSING THE BUSINESS!*
Do it for all the terror attacks . Hate has no state or country
I no the Manchester London attacks weren't in America it would have been nice for a tribute for those as wwe fans r worldwide.
Vince in the middle with his 2 boys.What a happy family.
It was very terrible what happened in Las Vegas. This was the 1st time the WWE held a moment of silence without the bell ringing 10 times because of a tragedy since the tragedy in Orlando over a year ago. God help both those cities.
That was so silent i thought my earbuds stoped working
STOP THE HATE pray for Vegas
Wow I haven't seen Vince or Tj in a long time.
It rally suvks when something like this has to happen in my hometown.
i don't get why anybody would dislike this
Respect to all the Families who lost a loved one in Las Vegas
I was watching the opening of the Redskins vs Chiefs game; saw some jerk sitting on the bench during the Anthem and fan(atics) making noise during the Moment of Silence.\n\nSwitched it over to Raw (I had waiting for me on DVR Double Play) and you could hear a pin drop during the Moment of Silence.\n\nClass!
Why are there so many attacks in different places I mean this HAS to STOP
lolz, theres no way that the wrestlers actually care about what happened xD
My prayers and thoughts to people lost life and got hurt in Los Vegas and Puerto Rico and Miami Florida and Texas and Mexico anywhere at.And plus we lost a lot of music singers and celebrity this year too.Tom Petty,The guy from Steely Dan passed away Walter Becker.And guy own a lot of game shows and TV shows has passed away to Monty Hall today the Co-Creator Let's make's a Deal.This is just sad day...😢😢😢
Hey what happens in vegas stays in vegas😂😂
I live in Las Vegas
Of course Bayley is standing next to Finn Balor
Hmmph\n\nWell, it looks like the one armed bandits struck again......\n\nI'll just pay my respects and see myself out.
Pray for the World!!! Lets have a moment of silence for the world daily
Kurt angel makes a traingel sign off illuminati wake upp
Never heard the arena so quiet
Its so sad and to know i was right across from everything at the luxor was even scariest
The people who disliked the video fick yourself
Thank you WWE you're doing a great job
It was so quiet I thought my earphones were broken!!!
0:23 look at slaters face did something happend to him?
WWE thank you for honoring the memory of those in Las Vegas.
Today's wrestling crowd might not be as active or loud as the crowd was 10-20 years ago, but at least their more respectful at actually being silent in moments of silence for tragic occurrences like the one in Vegas.
What happen in vegas stay in vegas.
Thank You WWE. For this heartfelt remembrance of the victims and families of Las Vegas..
My condolences to the family and friends to the people who lost their love ones  during that hard time. May they rest peacefully.
Is it really that many superstars on raw
We stand with los Angeles...
No way it got that silent I bet someone yelled something
Where is brock lesnar

#prayformossad/ciaoperation
Strowman must be finished with Roman after all.
Why do they keep putting real world events in a scripted tv show?
BORING!! No Body cares!
Why the heels are praying , they are bad people and must be. They are breaking their character which is not good for wrestling.
Yeah, a fat look of good prayers and sympathies will help. Hunt down and kill the bastards responsible for the attacks!
This is the proof that wwe is scripted. Why? Because they are totally enemy but they are joining together.
20 people got shot the man who shot the people killed himself to 💧💧💧💧💧💧💧💔💔💔💔💔
Notice hhh hbk charolette missing? because they are haters and liars.
And what about México and Puerto Rico?
so underrated.its so sad they deserve so much more
Sou uma típica fanática. Não posso resistir, sociedade... simplesmente não posso... 😍
They are sooo sexy, and so much fun! Love Haim!
This video looks like it was so much fun to film.. xx
Easy, peasy, nice and breezy. Much needed right now. Thanks. 🤞🏼
Is that the bar the song Lazy Eye is filmed in for it's video..?
I wish I were one of the extras (background dancers) 🔥❤️
dance party at HAIM's place
...the way they stop on a dime- is always so cool !!!!
Very nice and heart warming - listen to the guitar rifts in the back ground as well - it doesn't need my approval - a good feeling - thanks cec
Leave it to Paul Thomas Anderson to make Alana look ADORABLE.
They look like they’re having genuine fun. I love this video!
Like I LOVE YOU HAIM😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍❤❤❤🎵🎵🎵🎶🎶🎶🎧🎧🎧🎤🎤🎤
THIS WAS SO BLOODY AMAZING WOW
Who has listened to this more than once?
Melhor vídeo ever
I FUCKING LOVE THEM ❤️
THEYRE SO CUTE FUCK
Me encantooooo. 🔝🔝🔝💕🤗🤗
generic as hell
Love my girls
<3
YASSSS
I LOOOOOOOOOVE IT
Night So Long video pls 💗
yaaaaaaa
I love you ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Não acredito que as HAIM inventaram a coreografia do alternativo
Great video (again) and the album is a real grower, my 20 month old daughter always smiles when I play it.
when does Haim the musical come out?
does anyone know the title of this song?
All their stuff is amazing
i like how Haim makes their videos. There is no publicity stunts or skits its about them purely having a good time and jus jaming.
Greatest dancing video since Shiny Happy People from R.E.M. :)
the queens of walking down the streets!!!!
This video is so good, music too!
Paul Thomas Anderson and Haim, what else can I ask for???
After watching this video I tucked my shirt into my jeans & it’s become my style now lol
is there a behind the scenes video???
Plz do something about this video 😂
The definition of good vibes
These girls are amazing, make me feel 80's back again! Maravilhosas!
HAIM - Little of Your Love
this is so pure
I love Danielle as much as the camera does.
It's absurd to think people would actually dance to his in a clubby way.
They need a video for You Never Knew. I can just imagine it- 80's style video, Danielle driving a car while the other two are in the back, escaping from a murder scene. That would be amazing.
I hadn't heard any of HAIM's songs before yesterday. I came here as a PT Anderson fan, and left a fan of both PTA and HAIM. I've now watched this video an unhealthy amount of times, but given the recent events in the news it is certainly something the world needs.
YASSSS HAIM KEEP WALKIN AND WALKIN AND I STILL LOVE YA!!!!!
They love walk dancing. I feel it. They are great.
yay.. finally the official video.. it's one of my favorite tracks!!
I'm falling in love with the concept of a HAIM video
I liked the video before it even started. Anyone else? 😂
Grinning from ear to ear watching and listening to this!!! Freaking awesome!!! 🤗
shimmy-ing on a LARGER scale
They look effortless❤but classy💖. The HAIMs 👍at it again bravo👏. #sisterlysongs
Teach me how to walk
Danielle has quite the groove 😍
I just started a channel could you guys subscribe and view my video 😀
I'm picking up some Fleetwood Mac vibes, and I like it.
They're great to see Live
So much fun! I wish I was in this video.
Just makes me smile all the way through the song
U stoled the name from a band u idiots
What the heck is this. This is so stupid
I love how fun the music videos are
I really enjoy haim I just feel like their songs sound pretty similar some times
This is old sound mixed with hipster and a huge scoop of unoriginality, in short it sucks. Kimbra is a million times better than this.
nothing is more pure than alana in this video
Love thier music💘

3 shots up until 1:17. And folks are having a blast. There should be something in this video worth trashing on twitter or facebook... Something to get really fucking mad about. Is this really 2017?

I love when I refresh my YouTube subscription page and it's 1993.
Just what I needed to start my day! THANK YOU! Welcome back!!!
love breeders forever
What jerks voted this down? Breeders are back!
I love it!  Kim Deal I love you forever!!  I've been a fan about that long anyway.  Kisses!  xxx
Good to know that The Breeders came back to 4AD. This will bring again worldwide exposure the band deserves. Great track! Welcome back Kim, Kelley, Josephine and Jim!
'Wait in the car while mother beats the shit out of Sen. Jack Martins..'
I really dig it!
Wots... uh the Deal?
YES! Now I can stop grumbling that everything new sucks.
Give me the album already
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH NEW BREEDERS
I'm a happy camper!! Looking forward to seeing them in Glasgow. This has made my day.
Love it, stoked for the new record.
holy fuck i needed this! 🔥🔥💘💘⚡⚡
Oh Oh, is this a new album I hear?
Still got it, unlike the Pixies...
Freaking!!!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS !!!!!
makes you wonder why it took them forever and a bit to bring out some new stuff... just to give you the impression, there's nothing more casual to do in the world, once you hear it.\n\nThey found a way to pack all the classical Breeders magic into this 2 minutes, making it as catchy as ever. Kim's always been a goddess in writing short songs with character. She still got it.\n\nim eager to hear more
Nice!!!   Btw. so excited to see you in Berlin in a couple of days :-)
I love you Kim
Love it!!! Classic Breeders. Aging like a fine wine and I like fine wine too ;)
So wonderful, just what I need!
Good song! Thanks for a nice surprise. :)
This is the best way of waking up
GOOD MORNING! This song is *everything*! Made my week/month/year/life.
It's got a good beat https://youtu.be/7g3P18rTFMA?t=1m35s
New Breeders material is welcome in these trying times.
Here are the lyrics I tried to decipher. I am not sure about some parts. Would love suggestions or edits from everyone else.\n\nTHE BREEDERS, WAIT IN THE CAR\n\nGood morning\nConsider I\nAlways struggle with the right word\nMeow, meow, meow-meow-meow\nAs a sinner, I\n(unlock?) nothing that neat\nSinner I\nSinner I\nSinner I\nOh-oh, oh-oh\nMother wants to hold me down\nOh-oh, oh-oh\nWait in the car\nI got business\nForget the sun\nTime to get off, take it or not\nCause strategies for punks\nMother wants to hold me down\nMother wants to hold me down\nGonna chase the stars\nMaking a map, scraping off the sky\nJust to fall back\nSinner I\nSinner I\nSinner I\nOh-oh, oh-oh\nOh-oh, oh-oh\nOh-oh, oh-oh
instant classic! I'm so happy! !!!
pls sir can i have some more
YESSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!
BREEDERS  BREEDERS BREEDERS BREEDERS BREEDERS BREEDERS BREEDERS BREEDERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

YES! 💃👑🏆🍩🖤🎸
hate to say it but its not much of  song. just sound like a well mastered rehersal jam to warm up. Dissappionted.
it hurts a bit to say that but: This song alone is better than the last Pixies record.... its raw, its fun, its 90's but its fresh!
Meow meow meow!!
PostGrunge sounds like Burger'n'Fries nowadays
Vocals are boring
you're back!!!!
I was 8 when I discovered Cannonball thanks to my dad. I'm 23 and I still want to see them live. Come in France Breeders!
Watch Avatar: The Last Airbender. It's a kids show but it's also not a kids show. Either way, it's fantastic.
Last show I binged was Harlan Coben's The Five. Lost a whole day. Totally worth it. Told Jack to binge it too... hehe
Glow is amazing and a second season has been confirmed.
I'm sure you've said you've watched it (now that I think about it, that may be why I did haha) but Lovesick is so good to binge, maybe to keep up with the timeline, but I love the character development so much - it's great to get sucked into.
shows I've been binge watching lately.\n\n1. PrankMe - Cheers @ChewingSand for such a great little psychological horror/black comedy. I laughed, I cringed, there were some rather audible holy shit moments. Fantastic stuff\n\n2. Blood Drive - Batshit insane love letter to 1980's grindhouse cinema\n\n3. Wentworth - If you've seen Prisoner (Cell Block H for the UK folks) this updates that kind of women's prison drama beautifully. Can't wait for series 6
Only 9%. People have lied.
Can confirm you screamed at the TV.
The description you gave of Love, reminds me of You're The Worst. Two people who are very cynical towards life and love, meet and start falling for each other, but they both make it very difficult for themselves. The characters are also unlikeable. I have screamed at the screen while watching this lol, but it's very intriguing.
I'm a bit disappointed guys. Scrolled through all the comments and probable the best show I have ever seen never mentioned. \nEveryone should really try The Newsroom. Imo it probably has the best pilot episode of all the shows I have seen. I watched it 3 times already and I will watch it at least 3 times more in the next 10 years (the whole show, not just the pilot). The cast is amazing, the writing is on point, the characters are all so in depth and work together like PB%J. The series are about A fictional news station that does coverage on actual news that happened in real life while trying to uphold the highest jornalistic standarts. I cant imagine anyone who would quit the series after trying the first 3 episodes.  \n\nAlso watch Arrested development and Speechless\nMost of the other good stuff was already mentioned so im not going to repeat it.
My favourite shows\n1. Parks and Rec\n2. The IT Crowd\n3. Survivor \n4. Would I Lie to You
Brooklyn 99 is incredible and I really think you would enjoy it
i cannot recommend brooklyn nine nine enough honestly it has fantastic representation, it’s hilarious without relying on stereotypes or being offensive and it never fails to make me smile! also black mirror if you want intense amazing terrifying sci fi drama, and if you like rick and morty i would definitely recommend gravity falls ❤️
I really enjoyed Love! And watching Glow rn as well. Maybe will try Rick and Morty.
SKAM! You can literally watch all four seasons in 12 hours
Glow is great. :) \nAlready watched it, really great!\n\nThe second show you talked about, I don't know. \n\nRick and Morty i obviously know, but don't really like so much.\nThanks for your video. :)
You know me, I’m reverse giraffe. I’ve got a short neck and legs.
Please watch Crazy Ex-Girlfriend if you haven't already. It's a musical, it's incredibly written and the characters are so wonderfully flawed and the cast is brilliantly diverse. It is so incredible, and everyone should watch it (and binge it!) it's so underrated and Rachel Bloom is SO talented. And it's all on Netflix and season 3 starts next week.
omg you put how I feel about Love into words! I keep wondering why I actually like it seeing as I don't like either of the mains all too much but yeah their relationship is just really cool to watch unfold
I threw my hands up in the air when Hazel started with GLOW because I tell everyone to watch it but no one listens to my amazing recommendations!
1. Black Mirror\n2. Orange is the New Black\n3. Prank Me!\nAlso i started Rick and Morty a few weeks ago and im watching season 3. I've tried so hard to savour it because i dont want it to end but today will be the day i finish! It is my birthday after all🎈
unrelated to the video buuut your makeup looks AMAZING
I think you should try Orphan Black. It has amazing acting, and the writing is pretty good, although far-fetched at times. I'm curious to hear what you think about it :)
Atypical. 8 episodes that will make you laugh and cry and everything in between. So amazing, and on Netflix! X
people need to watch please like me!!! it's one of my favourite comedy shows (w/ it's always sunny and the it crowd) and no one talks about it + when it does tackle darker subjects it's done so well. totally binge worthy
10/10 recommend watching You're The Worst!
If your up for a full on binge-\n\n1.) Supernatural, it's about two brothers who hunt demons and other monsters and creepy stuff together. They're best friends with an angle by season 4 and it is hilarious, spooky and emotional and some points (yes it has 12 going on 13 seasons but it's totally worth it and so addictive, you'll fall in love with not only the show but also the characters and actors who play them)\n\n2.) Gilmore Girls, it's about a mother and a daughter who are best friends and their lives in their little town (it includes 8 seasons including the newer version, with the same cast of course..there is so much to love about all the characters)\n\n3.) American Horror Story, every season is a different creepy story which involves some sort of clown, ghost or different creepy thing (there are currently 7 seasons and it's freakishly great and trust me, it's worth it just to see Evan Peters being his usual gorgeous self)
I think you HAVE to watch One Day At A Time. That show was absolutely brilliant. It's a sitcom but all the while it manages to call out important issues like racism and sexism and searching for identity. It has an almost all female of colour cast with only one straight white guy. It's funny and real and just absolutely wonderful.
new girl!!!! all characters are SO well written and perfectly casted. Also brooklyn nine-nine and the crown!!!
my favorite recent binges\n1. big mouth (surprisingly super good and well written and clever)\n2. crazy ex girlfriend (so addicting, always takes the humor over the edge which is really entertaining)\n3. bojack horseman (don't even know where to begin it's amazing just watch it)
I KNEW Rick & Morty would be in here. It so fab and I must admit I did think 'this is something Hazel would like.' Interesting to hear you describe it though. I've tried to explain it to my friends/family/boyfriend/anyone that will listen and why they should watch it but it's so hard to describe! It's crazy smart, incredibly hilarious and then in the next second, so so dark. It's such a 'you have to see it to believe it' show! 💚👌
Have you seen the show Community? You mentioned Gillian Jacobs in the second show and I know that Alison Brie is in Glow, they're both in a sitcom called Community, it's amazing.
oh Hazel you are such a perfect combination of that old lady on the train who will try to convince you of how great that movie form the 60's is and that way younger than anyone chill aunt who will never miss an opportunity to have a party
For anyone who hasn't yet seen it, you should binge The Wire. It's one of the most real and brutally honest shows ever. It's complex and thrilling at the same time.
you should watch Crazyhead it's a Netflix original, Its so funny!
sense 8, It's THE MOST amazing show. so well shot and filmed and the cast is amazing, and its funny yet dramatic, and has some amazing fight scenes, but also relationships. It's got something for everyone.
my top three are probably\n1) riverdale\n2) series of unfortunate events (the acc tv series)\n3)GLOW\n<333333333 love this :)
THESE ARE 3 OF MY FAVOURITE SHOWS ON NETFLIX WTF HAZEL!!! \n\nDude you HAVE to- and i absolutely mean HAVE to- watch The Get Down, its an incredible series on netflix about underground disco and hiphop (and also kind of drug business) in the bronx in the 70's and its dramatic and its sad and its hilarious and its just everything, its genuinely my favourite show on this planet and its so well-made I absolutely reccomend it to anyone and everyone, especially if you're a fan of the 70's. \n\nThat was a long-ass run-on sentence and I also am just gushing and not reviewing bc im not good at using film terminology, but its seriously so incredibly shot, acted, written, everything. I think any movie buff will appreciate it (it was made like a 12-part movie kinda) so if you read this and choose to watch it please get Jack to watch it too.
I binged Black Mirror a few months ago and I'm just now coming out of a recuperative blanket fort. One of those shows you really can't binge.
Wow Hazel, I know you are in projects & stuff, but man! I've been missing you, thanks :)
I'll be honest, I was slightly disappointed that I've seen and loved all of these shows... although I'm quite happy that we share the same tastes
1. Supernatural\n2. Orphan Black\n3. The 100\n\nI know kinda seems like the usual cliche recommendations, but I swear these shows are absolutely amazing and so much more complex then they may seem!!
I had to put together my website and started watching GLOW in the background only to then take twice as long to finish my website because I was TRANSFIXED by this very strange but lovable show in front of me! And I've been missing them so much the last week and just can't bloody wait for Season 2 to come out!
My shows u should all binge watch!!\n- Brooklyn Nine Nine\n- Hemlock Grove\n- Black Mirror\n- Luther\n- Jessica Jones (only one season as of yet but oh well)\n- Bates Motel\n- Don’t trust the B**** in Apt 23\n- Fresh Meat\n- Atypical\n- Pretty little liars (went to shit in seasons 6 + 7 but the first 5 seasons are worth watching)\n- Fear the Walking Dead\n- The 100\n- Peep Show\n- Jane the Virgin
Other shows: \nI'm also one of those 11% who watches things based on friends recommendations haha. That's how I found Rick and Morty. But I seriously think you'll enjoy Orphan Black as it's (sort of?) an all-female cast(?) and it's incredible. \n1.) Orphan Black\n2.) Brooklyn Nine-Nine\n3.) Top of the Lake
I WISH people would stop using the word binge it is literally an eating disorder
Grace and Frankie is one that I really loved and binged on a lot! Would highly recommend it!
I definitely binge watch waaay too many shows but I’ve never seen Rick And Morty, I will definitely be binge watching it for the next couple of days after watching this video. Also the way you described Love and Glow perfectly summed up my love of both the shows. Thank you
I only watched part of the pilot of Rick and Morty with the whole seed thing, and I stopped, but now I'm curious and want to give it another shot because you like it so much. Rick just irritated the hell out of me!! \nAlright, instead of working after watching this video like I was going to, I'm going to watch a few more episodes.
Enjoyed Glow and love Rick and Morty. Though I watched 1 and a half seasons of Love, (hoping s2 would be better.) And I just found it very meh. \nThere was nothing that really made me want go come back for more,. The comedy seemed to rely on the one aussie flatmate and parts kind of felt like a nerdy dudes wet dream. \nI like Gillian Jacobs as an actress and the basis of Love seem to be a type of show I would enjoy, so I went in with an open mind, but left a little dissapointed.
A show I feel has not got enough attention is This Is Us, it’s just so beautiful and clever and heartwarming and sad (the second season just started but I’m waiting so that I can binge it all)
The Good Place\nSeriously. Kristen Bell plays Eleanor who has died and gone to The Good Place. Except, she's not actually a good person and it was a mistake. Hilarious show. Also, they can't swear in The Good Place, so holy forking shitballs there's a lot of good jokes
okay, i know it's pretty basic, but river dale is coming back soon and i would highly recommend watching it. the main character's plot line is basically the same as troy's from high school musical, but there's also *murder* lol
love... a show about people you don’t like... reminded me of mad men in that way
This show is quite old so you've probably already seen it but genuinely, the L word is SUCH A GOOD SHOW. the characters are so interesting and likeable but also so unlikeable at the same time and it does show the ups and downs of relationships as well and you see relationships that work so well fall apart and no so good ones work together and I could keep going on but I don't want this to be too long. But seriously would recommend
You should binge!  What does that mean in English?
I just love you. I know that you want to make high quality content but I'd be happy to listen to you talking about something as trivial as cat food for hours and hours! Please make more videos - on whatever you want to. 😄
Watch Fleabag. Hazel, if you don't absolutely adore it I will look for pigs flying in the sky.
I love schitts creek it has this amazing dry humor and the acting is brilliant \nhouse of cards...i just love house of cards the filming is great\nThe fall... is a darker show but I enjoy the way they let the viewer kind of feel what the characters are feeling with out tell you straight out
I don't really watch TV or shows in general but I catch up on Family Guy, The Simpsons and Rick & Morty sometimes (I love cartoons aha)
rick and morty isn't on netflix in canada ?????????? but it is in other countries??????????????
Alas Rick and Morty is not on Canadian Netflix
hazel have you seen quantum leap? it's probably about 30ish years old, has about 6 seasons. it's sic-fi, but it's so freaking interesting and has this insanely great concept where this physicist develops a time machine and instead of jumping back to his present day, something mystical/divine takes control of the machine and uses it to right the wrongs in the past. the physicist along with his holographic pal, helps him figure out how to set things right.  i really think you should check it out. it's emotional, hilarious and really really ahead of it's time in terms of racism and feminism. PLEASE CHECK IT OUT
I literally love you so much I can't even x
RIVERDALE ISNT ON THIS LIST,\nbut Rick and Morty is so I can forgive you.
if you liked rick and morty i think you would like bojack horseman!! it's in the same genre of cartoons for adults but it's a lot more emotionally mature and does some really interesting commentary on celebrity culture!\nalso, i know how you feel about getting sad when you finish binging a show. i'm procrastinating watching the last season of 30 rock because i don't want it to end :(
I feel cheated. I've binged and finished all three already!
rick and morty is absolutely the best animated show airing right now, clever, funny, and dark in ways you wouldn't even fucking imagine, the only one that can stand remotely close to its quality is bojack horseman for me. And if people don't know it, broadchurch is on netflix which didn't receive enough love in my opinion, cause it is really good.
I really love Him & Her, it's such a wonderful show, HIGHLY recommend
I really need to watch Rick and Morty! I know I'm very late to the party with this, but I just binge watched the first season of Fargo and wooowww it's good! Also everyone needs to watch the BBC miniseries adaptation of War and Peace currently on Netflix because its bloody amazing! It's beautifully shot, has perfect casting and does SUCH a good job of adapting the right parts of that behemoth of a book for tv.
Binge watched Parks and Rec and genuinely felt like crying at the end of it.
Nathan for you is easily the most underrated show on TV
Well, speaking of 80's nostalgia and smart shows then there's no better than Halt and Catch Fire. The whole show revolves around 3 main characters who are trying to make the first personal computer. Of course the story evolves and is way more complex but the whole thing takes place in the 80's and around coding and the personal computer revolution of the 80's. It also has some of the best character developments in any series I've ever watched. Very underrated show but believe me it's worth watching.
You talking about that specific episode of Rick and Morty is really interesting... My flatmate is trying to get me to watch that episode to get me to like it... Haven't yet. Might get around to it.
Brooklyn 99 is my show to binge but I don't have the restraint to save the episodes for a binge so I watch them as they come out and then go back and binge them all
Black mirror. \nBojack Horseman \nAnd I just started this one but it seems to be promising, Disjointed. (I mean how can you go wrong with Kathy Bates?)
I just finished watching The 100. It might not be the best show ever, but I thought it was better than most. Post apocalyptic drama, dark and sometimes a little gross, but worth it.
YO I literally finished GLOW today and I was like ‘hope it gets mention or I’m gonna flip’ it’s so so good!
i love shameless, jane the virgin, the big bang theory, bojack horseman, f is for family and fresh meat. those are just some suggestions
YES GLOW
You look like Grace from Peaky Blinders!
Brooklyn Nine Nine & Bojack Horseman, two vastly different but hilarious shows.
THE GOOD PLACE

G L W O
yall should watch brooklyn nine nine
thanks! this was really helpful, i've been looking for some recommendations for a while now~ these all sound great!!
Bron / Broen aka The Bridge, the Swedish / Danish series.
Gilmore girls! It has excellent filmography, extremely intelligent script writing, and a vast number of clever pop culture references
Black Mirror. I'm sure you've seen at least a few episodes. Would love to get your take on it esp. considering the tones and plots of Septem and PrankMe
Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency!!! It's based on the Douglas Adams novel and is equally batshit tbh like I can't really explain it very well. Basically, imagine Sherlock Holmes, but he's fucking awful at his job. Like he doesn't know anything, ever (actual quote from the show). Toss in a corgi and a kitten as main characters along with some murder and various sci-fi shenanigans... trust me it's amazing
You described Glow really well, and the way you put it really made me consider wanting to watch it even though I haven't before, so thank you!
Small correction: The Saturn V rocket is obviously Saturn 5 as it's a roman numeral. Sorry about that.\nEnjoy the video!
Awosome!!! Not sure about 2024 but definately he will do it, im just excited that they will do it in our lifes span
There's people dying from starvation and these MF are spending millions of dollars in finding new planet.
i unsubed cuz you dont fact check or try to debunk anything
DO WE GET FREE INTERNET ON MARS
No one cleared this with me.. We'll see about all this.. How do you know I don't have something waiting for that ass once you chimps get there.. 👺
people looking for intro music song \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGB4lB9VVBI
Have you concerned a sonic Boom of the BFR delivering passengers around the world or that an apollo launch was just over 3g and the BFR will land at 10g I don't think most executives want they arse hole to fall out on landing and blackout it's crazy hype all around this guy it's will be a robocop type device next just sit back and look at the engineering before you jump onboard a hyperloop wreck you nearly hit it with the currency video then you retracted it not to be a target and just fell back in the trap of capatlism and it's lies.
Work more at it and faster. How about going too the Moon?
I always crack up when someone says 'BFR' esp in a serious tone.\n\nPS-I love Musk...what a great man.
Imagine your loved once being in mars far away from you in future. 😅
They've got booster landings down pat now, but I think it will take them multiple failures to master landing the upper stage (which will be a very different massing when returning empty, with cargo, and with passengers). With such a large and expensive vehicle, I wonder whether they'll be able to get it down before they run out of money.
When Elon Musk says something, i believe it.
NASA should just be able to buy BFRs on a government contract from SpaceX with the license to be able to modify the rocket however they see fit. No need to waste time and money on two designs to get to Mars.
I want to go to mars just to get away from these leftards ruining society for everyone.
I'm curious to see what would happen to the human body when subjected to 1/3 of Earth's gravity for an extended period of time. I'm especially curious to see how children's bodies will develop if born on mars. \n\nExercise is good hygiene here on Earth. I imagine it may be necessary for survival on Mars. \n\nBut who knows, I could be entirely wrong. They may just develop to be a sustainably frail subspecies of humans. But humans adapted to Mars coming to Earth may be impossible for physiological reasons.
You sir who created this channel along with the people who works hard in making your videos, are AMAZING! I'm glad you existed.
I think Mars could be an excellent opportunity to research teraforming. In the process of trying to teraform mars, perhaps we could find a way to fix our planet?
Matt damon's movie ELYSIUM in the making....
THIS is how it NEEDS TO BE DONE :   Put robots on Mars first, so that the structures can be put into place before anyone arrives.  Sending people before any life-sustaining structures are build is just asking for trouble and death.
This is a good age to be alive. First human on other planet is something comparable to the invention of writing and of course more spectacular than that.If Musk manage to do that he will be remembered till the end of humanity.
It's possible, but musk creeps me out.
Hey Dagogo please cover the nobel prize winners :)
Does this mean there will be a call of duty marsian warfare?
If Earth  will turn in Fallout, people would happily to go to Mars to pursue better life. Oops, don't tell this to Elon Musk!!
Big Fucking Rocket BFR thats what it stands for
It could be true if they had enough funding. If nasa or space x had like a 100 billion budget every year we could speed up the process by so much that we'd even start colonizing Mars by 2050 or earlier and maybe start traveling to other solar systems.
A $2 million cessna light aircraft **shows cessna 152 worth under $100K**\n\nI hope thats not what Musk meant
Hmm let's see.......Pay Pal, a success, Tesla, a success, solar panel tiles, batteries, hyperloop.....etc...........we have a good shot at this one
If ArroGant is correct and BFR = Big Fucking Rocket then I do not think it bodes well for the future and someone is not thinking ahead. What's next? FBFR=Fucking Big Fucking Rocket, VBFR=Very Big Fucking Rocket, GBFR=Gigantically Big Fucking Rocket, MFBFR=Mega Fucking Big Fucking Rocket. I hope and prey it is more like Biennial Flight Review or Biggest Finest Rocket or Blast & Fragment Resistant or Biggest Furniture Removers.
Cold fusion i really  appreciate your videos and your efforts in making them \nJust keep going \nLove your work
06:20 - I think the BFR is a pretty good idea... Gross understatement
If wi not go to Mars wi vill be instinkt 😡 because of nuclear WAR😡😎😎 AND GASS CARS AND MORE
Funny to think this happened next door to my home!\nI actually watched the whole presentation by Mr Musk on YT. It was very detailed, broken down in easily digestible steps, with lots of graphs and animations alongside thoroughly pondered yet spontaneous comments by Mr Musk. The kind of presentation you need to see to realise how invested, hardworking and determined the Space X team is.\n\nI think the weakest link of Mr Musk's project is going to be nothing but...fundraising. The moment people stop pumping money into his venture, it will come to a halt... for ever. He is clearly aware of this, which is why he made this update.\n\nNow, the thing is wealthy people are butterflies: they flap around what smells nice, for as long as it is blooming. I'm sure that none of them are really interested in Mr Musk's project, unlike him and his crew. Once other distractions crop up (and there are bound to be plenty, with atroll of a President like Mr Trump), I can't help but think that the very people Mr Musk relies on will disappear and disappoint him (probably in a couple of years' time). Just like it happened with Mr Tesla and many others before.\n\nNevertheless, Mr Musk will be remembered for having inspired generations Y & Z individuals to become scientifically and technologically literate. All is well.
We should be ready to going to war with Mars. I'm sure the native Mars (4th or more generation that was born on Mars) would not want to relate to Earth as colony. Just look at USA history.
Kindly make a video on “How big is MRF” it is a indian tyre brand. Just look at this case. If you interested in this kindly make this video. And plz reply
Yet people will still be living in poverty
Imagine Planet Wars, until now we have just seen World Wars.
i want to die in andromada!! and I am an AI researcher so maybe I can do it using some AI!!!!!
I HOPE Elon considered Power Ledger!\n#Energy on the #Blockchain
Elon's Musk.\n\nThe new fragrance.
But Mars is literally a desert. Why would we want to go there and how would we survive if there is no water there?!
We are already there.
wonder if the timeframe will be kept as good as the estimated tesla model 3 units
We are gona make it unless the WWIII somehow breaks out eventually. Challenge and opportunity coexist for the mankind. God bless the people constrained in this spacetime.
You're on the British trending tab!!!\nCongrats!
alright. Next step MCRN and the epstein drive.
Elon for president on Mars!!!
We have to try and deal with the challenges as they surface.
From Amazon to SpaceX to Nasa and Lockheed, all are in a race to colonize Mars first. But I really wonder why. All these separate missions will cost billions to trillions of dollars. Why don't they invest this money on something which is habitable, earth (still, and for a few more decades possibly), do research to reverse or control global warming effects and rising temperatures (mend Ozone holes) and water scarcity, help millions of people, and continue to keep earth habitable? Why making mankind a multiplanetary specie has become suddenly so important when there are hundreds of large-scale issues to handle? Can anyone help me understand this???
I'm really saddened by the fact that he didn't say have a good one at the end of the video.
@6:54 what is this picture and the plant-looking objets?
I want to go in an electric rocket :D\nWell its not been developed yet... I think but launching a rocket with electro magnets or electricity... Might be a reality someday.. Just my thought
So maybe by 2022 we can order a Tesla model 3 and not have to wait over a yet to get it??
Now the future sounds cool.. imagine if they actually make Mars like earth, be able to breath and grow food and what not it'll solve many problems and as earth getting over populated and Earth might end one day least we'll have earth it's a start :D maybe in 500+ Years exploration around the glalaxy will be a thing.
I hope that native Martians are in hiding underground and when Elon gives Mars an atmosphere they’ll come out and give us some really intense knowledge of the universe
Anybody have any idea where i can get the picture from 6:50?
It's 2017, we should have lunar base by now...so true Elon Musk
The future is now
So many Musketeer fuckboy's about, my god the education system is fucked nobody can tell real life from the fantasy that spews out of Musk's stupid mouth.
BFR = Big Fucking Rocket. \n\nEver since doom all i see is big fucking in front of everything
It's so crazy how changing your name from coldfustion to coldfusion enabled you so many more subscribers. I remember when you had way under 100k subs and were thinking about stopping this youtube thing.\n\nSo happy you continued making videos!! (A little bit of SEO can go a long way ;) )
lol people in Africa starving for water and food. here they talking about to go Mars
I love Elon Musk. With out a doupt the most important man on the planet. I'm so thankful we have him. He makes me proud of my species.
love ur channel
With Elon Musk anything is possible!
BFR = Big Fucking Rocket
hats off to elon musk💙
Amazing
*Doomguy intensifies*
Why tho?
cool from Chris Cybernet Applications
BFR : Big Fucking Rocket ...
Very possible.
Challenging? major understatement.
Hmm nice
Lol . . . Global Warming solved. . .
Fuck Mars
Who actually believes this shit would work? Rockets are really explosive, launchpads are expensive, and landing is relatively difficult. \n\nAt any possible price, people would be paying 3X as much to save like freaking 7 hours of travel time. Best case:\n\nProject actually works in 40 years. Price relegates it to the rich.\n\nWOOOOOO. FAKE HYPE OVER IMPOSSIBLE IDEASSSS. I DON'T FACT CHECK!
i believe there will be SOME complications, but it really seems like elon is DETERMINED to get to mars AND make a difference on earth, so i dont think he will let anything except death get in his way! I do not THINK the race to mars will get scraped,in fact, all this seems vaguely familiar to what people in the 1960's must of been feeling when they found out we were planning a mission to the moon(most people dont like transformers 3 dark side of the moon, but i do find it strange that we all raced to the moon,then shut down funding.) now,here we go again,except the goal is mars. did something crash on mars and now everyone is trying to get there to see what it was? who knows. great video man
why does he slobber on elon's dick so much?
There is no space...no planet. Earth is flat with impenetrable dome.
The fucker can't send even a dog to the Moon but wants to send people to MARS PFHAHAHAHAHA
By the time the second ship arrives the people who arrived on the first ship will be dead. And if elon musk applies this much money and resources on this existing planet(EARTH) we will not have to think of moving to another planet.
The earth is flat! It's all a lie
I might be able to visit Mars within my lifetime. I can't even wrap my head around how amazing this is.
its nonsense. the earth is flat
I call bullshit. I think Elon Musk has a lot of genius  in him, and a lot of crazy too.
He just underestimates the difficulties... 2024 is just 6-7 years from now, I would be surprised if SpaceX reached Mars in 2030s...
what the hell ! i don't know why would anyone believe in what they say.\nthe earth is flat go check for yourself period.
please watch thunder foots video on the anywhere on earth in an hour
ha ha ha they changed the year again how can anyone buy into this crap! Check out Orion project they admit they can't get passed the van allen belts!
Yes let’s colonise an uninhabitable planet good job
We should fix the problems of this world, before going to another.
Fusion is slave of musk
Only fun thing with going to Mars is that you would be first.
Here's hoping that he goes to Mars and doesn't come back.
Humans should be putting their own house in order. If we lack the wisdom to live harmoniously on earth, why would anyone expect us to do so on other worlds?
hahahaha we are never going to mars we still don't have a real video of humans on the moon
Why would you use a spaceship when you can use a plane?
Yes please with the fanny prep video!
the puzzle development in this was so accurate! everyone starts out loving puzzles but then by about an hour in they want to throw it across the room but at the same time you cant give up haha!\nI am going to need a puzzle update next week!!! xxx <3
does someone else hear music in the background during the haul? just checking that i'm not going crazy
Loved the vlog as always and loved all of your outfits this week Louise, were is the coat with the fur trim that you are wearing at the end from ? thanks xxx
oh lord, i bloody love you, Louise. You rock. Please be you always, ta. X
Your not awful for making a decision for you and your baby. Out of curiosity would like to know what you would prefer if you can choose this time?
I think it is vital for people to be open about how much they earn. As an upcoming uni grad I am looking at careers and, although it's not the only factor I consider, a huge factor of my decision making will be based on salary. If I don't know the money that is available from a career path then how do I know if that is something I will want to pursue to suit my lifestyle choices. I hope that makes sense and doesn't come off like I'm only thinking about making money!
I personally freely talk about how much I earn but that's just my personal preference. I am highly interested in how people that have jobs on social media and such do earn money like how it all works, but it's just everyone's personal preference on whether they disclose how much they earn. ❤
Where was the mrs pots and chip cup from
Can we all please worship Louis's eyeliner it is on point the whole video 👌
I used to use a jug with cooled boiled water when going to the toilet after giving birth
THE LITTLE BOOK OF CALM! Black Books, anyone?
I think it's okay if people are just interested to know how they can make money on line. It's certainly not okay to ask other people how much money they make, or for people to brag about how much they  make😺😺😺😺. The brownies looked really nice. Love the snuggly kittens. Xxx
Giant sacks of cloth.. literally me pregnant or not 😂
I think a persons salary is private xx
It’s a good day when you get excited over seeing a guy you don’t even know just cause of how much hype Louise has made over him 😍😍 am I the only one? Yeah probably idc 😂😂
Love your eye makeup with that hair!! So beautiful 😍
Please make a fanny prep video soon!😅 Expecting my first baby and need some tips before due date in 6weeks😝
if people are interested for the good reasons (about the  money)  I think it would be interesting to know how do you earn money 😉 not how much, I do think it's impolite
I'd say if you know someone quite well or maybe looking to apply for what job they have, asking what salary someone has is fine but i wouldnt just go around and ask anyone that does feel rude to me. Do a smaller puzzle maybe like 500 piece wouldnt be as much of a challenge😂 I've done a 1000 piece disney princess one a while ago and it was actual hell!
Don't put pressure on yourself to breastfeed, your true subscribers and people within your life will understand whatever you choose to do. It's a personal choice, I have zero intention to breastfeed even though in theory I will be completely capable of doing so.\n\nAlso looking forward to the fanny prep video! \n❤️
I still think it's rude to ask how much money someone makes but there is often a massive divide between viewers and creators which is were the interest comes in, if you're working long hours nearly everyday and come home to watch youtube and see them receiving free gifts and affording the lifestyle some do, it can be frustrating as youtube is perceived to be an 'easy' job, i don't think it is an easy job but some creators/influencers are doing incredibly well compared to say nurses or teachers.
Eating fish and chips and watching Mulan sounds like the perfect night to me!
I wasn’t breath fed and as far as I can tell the only thing that could be criticised about me is I’m socially awkward but I can’t blame my mothers tit for that
your videos always make me feel better, so thank you <3
Whilst breastfeeding is probably preferable, it’s great to be realistic. It’s not for everyone, and it’s great to be prepared for you and babe! Love your vlogs Louise (and the hair is awesome!)
I love your hair colour! 🦄😊💚💛💜💙
I don't see a link to Sarah's book
I have 2 sphynx cats and really get fed up of people saying they are ugly!! They are different for sure but not everyone is the same and i love all cats! Mine are just different!
I'm learning so much about childbirth and motherhood and I'm a 22 year old postgrad student 😂
I agree I think it's incredibly rude to talk about how much you earn. It is no one else's business what you earn. I think because we see youtubers living a very comfortable and sometimes luxury lifestyle people are interested to know how much you make because it seems more attainable than a traditional celebrity and also because it's curiosity isn't it, we have no idea, not even a rough idea, where as most professions you have a rough idea of the salary. But I'm on your side, i wouldn't tell anyone how much money I earn and I'd be offended if anyone felt they had the right to ask x
I bought LOADS of waterwipes. My baby (6weeks old tomorrow) bloody hates them they are sooooo cold. Just a heads up... aldi wipes and nappies are amazing! I started on pampers and waterwipes but didn't like either xx
Breast feed or bottle feed it's no ones damn business!  Your bub your choice 💕💖.  I thinks it's sooo rude to ask someone how much money they earn. In saying that, (UTUBER)Danielle Mansutti said( I think I have this right) that to work out approx how much utubers get paid per video, take the last two numbers off the views, ie if it's viewed 34650 times, they would get paid about 346 for the video. She also said it depends on the country, US utubers get paid heaps more than Australian ones. It's interesting, but I wouldn't ask or expect to be told.
Haha, my sister and I are starting our ‘Puzzle Club’ on Sunday. Thanks for the idea! ☺️
This may be a weird comment but Louise has perfect lips.
Aw man I went to ikea MK last Wednesday night, a day too late
There’s an amazing tapas in Northampton can’t remember the name but it’s in the market square x
You know what, I could really do with a homely Zoe and Louise vlog! Running errands and chilling in the house, love that kinda thing!
In regard to the bottle feeding, as the lovely Gi Fletcher would say, 'Happy mum, happy baby' you do whatever's best for you and baby, if you're distressed and upset with say breastfeeding, then it won't do baby any good. Your little girl will turn out great whether you breastfeed her or not because you're a fantastic mama! Good luck with the rest of the pregnancy and the delivery Louise, and your recovery, I hope all goes smoothly xxx
Hey guys, I've been making YouTube videos for a while now and I'm really trying to reach 200 subs, I would really appreciate it if you subbed ❤️
Louise breastfeeding is very personal and I hate that you had to justify yourself and brace yourself for the comments. No one is going to understand understand what you will be going through nor your choices. No explanation needed.
Jeez I could fit a sign saying do not enter in the humongous gap in your teeth😂😂😂
As you were talking about winners never quit as you hated the puzzle,  Can't Stop This Thing We've Started by Bryan Adams was playing in the background. He knew. Bryan always knows.
Hi only just got round to watching your weekly, me and my little baba are bk from the hospital where I've been reading your book (which o love btw) and I'm now chilling home and got my baby who's adorable, now I'm just so excited to see your lil one !!love watching what people are getting for their babies
I work in the public sector so google would happily tell you what I earn. Personally I'm all for talking about earnings if not only to inspire the next generation to aim higher but also to create an open culture. I worked for a company that once banned us from talking about earnings until someone let out they earned nearly 4k more than someone else doing the same job!
lovely weekly vlog as always 💜 on the subject of money/earnings, I think that the interest around Youtubers making money and how much has become such a largely speculated thing purely because nobody knows the exact answer. Personally I am not bothered whether or not I ever find out how much that may be, but I will say that I am quite curious about what the roundabout figure is. I'm a naturally nosey person but would never EXPECT this information from anyone
It is good to talk about what you earn in an informative way! xx
I think its interesting with the whole money thing, I personally (and please don't take offence to this) think its a privilege to be able to keep your earnings private. As someone who as worked in the NHS and is now studying to continue my career in the NHS my salary is completely public knowledge, I get why because the taxpayer pays my wage but I don't get the option to be private about what I earn you just need to google it. I think that discussion is the best way to grow, particularly in business, woman tend to be paid a lot less in comparison to their male counterparts for the EXACT same job but often people don't know because we don't discuss it. One of the only industries with no gender pay gap is the NHS(yes there are plenty of problems with NHS pay but this isn't one of them) I personally think part of this is to do with the complete transparency in regards to salary. You are totally within your rights to keep your earnings private and I agree that asking your salary on national TV is totally rude and not ok but general discussion and transparency on money I think is important in equality and in terms of understanding industry.
Re Money questions - as a student I find that all my peers are happy to talk about how much they earn/their money situation (e.g. ‘ugh my job only pays £5.30 per hour’ or ‘yay my loan comes in tomorrow’ or ‘omg I only have 36p in my account’) but all the adults in my life would never talk about how much they earn, how much money they have saved up etc. I wonder when you make that transition...
Tmi this comment, but I found that tilting to one side on the toilet it didnt hurt to pee but it didnt hirt to get a bath for me either after i give birth and got stitches xxx
The kittens 😭😍
Louise you’re amazing ❤️
Don't feel guilty about bottle feeding!!!!  Do you!
It is rude to ask people how much you earn , there’s only 4 people who know how much I earn and they are my mom , dad , my employer and myself!
Such a shame that it is difficult for you to say that you might not breastfeed... Even if you just made the decision not to youre the mum so you know best... always... its a shame as well that it is also other women putting down other women! also s lot of the goodness you produce is in the first 3 days so even if you managed that it would be amazing :) i really hope you manage to do whatever is right for you!
Louise, your words about breast/bottle made me think of this - https://fedisbest.org/
Why did you do the puzzle like that!? Sort through all the pieces and separate the edges first!
The Little Book of Calm from Black Books
Love Asda/George for bedding. Always have the greatest designs. Going to copy and order my new Xmas ones this week. Would love Halloween bedding but cant find any good ones in the Uk..
Nobody should be forced to reveal their income but I think it would be helpful if overall as a society we were more comfortable sharing that information. At least to the people we work with or around us. Not talking about it can create shame around money (earning a lot or not earning much) and that's not helpful to anyone. Also, sharing the information can help close the gender pay gap. Obviously people have a LOT of hang ups about money and so I understand why people don't like to share. I've found it helpful to be open about it with friends, reduces any awkwardness when people know where you're at and it's easier to ask for/offer help or say when you can't afford something or you'd rather not spend money on something.
As a student, I find it really interesting and helpful to know how other students make money and spend/safe it. It is a topic i frequently talk about with friends/fellow students. I do not see that as rude but as very helpful.
When I had my first, I was told to give my daughter a bottle at 4 weeks so that she will take a bottle. I did and I completely breastfeed her, but she takes a bottle for when I am out and it is so freeing! As far as the debate, as long as baby is fed its just fine! Breast or formula fed is best! I think it is very wise of you to be prepared!
Does anyone else automatically think of Black Books when they see The Little Book of Calm?
Missed what happened\nTo the old house cats? Xx
I think that it is slightly rude to talk about money, it is interesting to know how you and other youtubers earn money. But I don't think anybody should ask a person how much they earn, I found it awkward when my PE teacher asked me how much I earn because it is something personal to the person asked
I saw u n Marcus on tv the other day when Richard Madeley asked if you were rich … loved how u turned it back round on him. I find it so rude to ask someone about how much they earn but for some reason it seems to be ok to ask people who earn money online that question???
I'd be really interested to hear how to make money online. I am a teacher so what i earn is a matter of public record - i dont get the choice but it doesn't particularly bother me. If people earn more good for them, if they dont and theyre happy good for them! I dont find money a taboo topic, talking about it doesnt mean you are boasting as everyone appreciates you have worked hard and you frequently comment that you feel you are 'blessed' to do what you love and i feel the same - regardless of what i earn.
this is why i hate trending
I'm a teacher so my salary can be found easily online but I tell the students roughly how much I earn so they can find out how much different jobs salaries are. I think it is helpful to talk about even if it is uncomfortable to talk about sometimes.
In college I learned that talking to people (and specifically coworkers) about how much money you make is taboo because employers don't want you to discuss earnings in case you feel you are being unfairly compensated, especially in cases where female employees are paid less than men. Not exactly what you were talking about but I thought it was interesting!
I've been applying for jobs recently and a couple of them in their applications, asked how much i made in my last job. I  didn't particularly like being asked the question as it had nothing to do with the job.
Oh have you seen the Black Book episode where Bill Bailey accidentally eats a little book of calm? So funny!
Bottle vs breastfeeding debate is stressful but what works for you& baby will work for you two. My mum had to bottle feed my sisters & I for various reasons & we all turned out great. (If I may say so myself). ;)
I think it is rude to ask people how much they earn but at the same time it is good to know a general salary for a job that you could be interested in going in to
The best you can give your baby is the colostrum which is like the first few days. FED is best. There isn't enough support for breastfeeding mothers these days, so it is completely understandable when they find they can't manage. I completely respect mums who try breastfeeding but choose to move on to formula. And, to be honest, those who choose formula from the get go. You need to make the best decision for you and your baby. X
I think it is important to talk about money because we, all humans, made it such essential to us. In respect to how much anyone earns, I think you only have to divulge that personal information to people that you trust and want to tell. Of course it is interesting to find out how Youtube, AdSense and so on works. But if anyone needs further information on that because they are new youtubers I`m sure they can find it somewhere?  It`s great when more experienced youtubers share in what they found out over the years individually though. That makes for a more social and transparent community.
When people ask me how much I make I have no problem telling them, but I think it's different because I work an hourly retail job, and people are always curious to know how much you can make at different part time jobs in college.
I really wish people wouldn’t go on and on about that argue! People should do what they’re confutable with for what every reasons, just leave them too it.
26:12 I also have that laundry tablet container- I love it!
Now i want a baby lol
I breastfed for all of 3 minutes with my daughter(tried for a long long time). She wouldn't latch because she was sick and I was completely drugged up from my c section. I beat myself up about it for almost a month. My daughter will be three months on the 19th and is strictly bottle fed and 100% healthy. That squirt bottle was an absolute life saver!! I used mine for cleaning my incision after I got home and it is still in my shower
I just love the transition I've started a puzzle club, yayy - I hate puzzle club x))

For all those triggered Arsenal fans, it’s just a joke. Relax 😂
What a fucking legend!

😂😂😂
😂😂
Barcelona Reject... TWICE!! 😂😂😂
This guy has no class whatsoever.
fuck fabregas dat disrespectful bitch.
Fooking wanker!
I'm an Arsenal fan.. But I can't find anything funny to cheer febregas like that for what he has done.. Dude do u think throwing a pizza to a respectable manager in the premier league is pretty cool??  U should ask for apologies not admitting ur fault with this joyful face!!
Could you next time please tell us what tire pressure you use for riding,jumping,.....
That is one MEGA SICK set of wheels
Why is Macklemore testing these carbon wheels and using a Scottish accent? ?
Racer wheels wouldn't stand a chance ......, because they are crap lol
I need this rim, mine is bent so bad that a certain rotation point it hit against the bike frame on both sides and it makes funny noisy. Long story short my rim is fucked
He was next to my house
I thought the title said Reverse Carbon Wheels\n\nWas hoping for rubber rims and carbon tires lmao
please make a 20 in bmx wheelset
Carbon is strong, no doubt!
that's some crazy quality compared to aluminum or steel
I stick to my old school alloy 26
PLEASE do no do this test again in a public space...you know that when carbon fiber breaks it leaves very sharp splinters everywhere so don't you think some animals like a dog could get injured walking in that area? Love you guys but just wanted to point that out.
seeing him do that when it went flat hurt me in way you can't imagine 😂
Cant be that good if they break that easy
What is this bike name?
Don't you want some flex in the rims so hits dont feel as hard
So sweet such a sick rider 👌👌
How do they hold up doing 40mph on a rocky downhill?
That's always the slight niggle with carbon fibre - when it fatigues to failure it's abrupt
I wish I could have at least 10 presents of his skills
Santa Cruz bikes are so beautiful, but I can't afford them 😕
Add air, remove suspension, add a ton of weight
whens danny going to start a channel?
Bet I could snap it in 10 mins or less did it to !my identiti 666x snapped it clean in half
You don't need your bike😂
Now we want to see aluminium rim test
$1599 with the Dt350 hub\n$1899 with the I9 torch hub\nYa only problem is for a set of those rims I could buy a full 11 of my current bicycle with the Dt350 hub and 13 with the I9.
When these rims will available in 20 inc? , I want try them on a bmx. Becouse  its carbon it means its extra fuckin low weight??or nah
Today i tried that by my old fulcrum but no puncture haha and its awesome !!!
I thought he was about to ride it tireless over a balcony or some crap
I think id rather aluminium bend than carbon fiber break in a stack and risk getting skewered  , picking the splinters out would be a bitch
at that point I would have fallen down the stairs. https://youtu.be/VfjjiHGuHoc?t=120
eBay description be like it has been taken good care of only used for a few hours
0:59 😮 I almost died of a heart attack \nSo risky
Imagine what the person person who invented bicycles would say
I wonder if jaws would Ollie that.. 1:55
They were just hoping he'd buy a set. They cost £5 million
Amazing the way Danny can throw around a full susp bike What forks does he ride?
This is so sad, all the quality parts these people mess up. I could have a nice bike built from all the stuff they shouldn't have messed up.
Can I buy that bike off of you guys
强的一批
Damn... great marketing move. Def some good rims.
Gotta love Chemistry

Happy Hump Day, everyone! Coming atcha with a fresh episode of favorites! Let me know what you loved or tried this month here. 😊
OMG !!!so in love with ur eye make up !!! any tutorial or which products u are using ?? 😻😻😻😻
There is a movie on Wild!
My favorite person is you 😢😢😢❣️❣️❣️
I'm so glad you and amy/vagabondd youth are friends I feel like she deserves so many more subs than she has.  She's the reason I found your channel and I love both of you sooooooooooo much!!
the part where you explained how you remember the image from horror movies while washing your face is so relatable!!
Oooo I want to read Wild now! Also, say 🙅🏻 to butthole lips.
Uhm that active imagination comment about watching it. Is literally exactly why I don’t watch scary movies. The image stays in your head for life is so true
I have been a victim of butthole lips just too many times
DEATH NOTE is my jam for sure <3
Please let me know what you think of Boys Over Flowers (Hana Yori Dango). It was the basis of the f4 dramas that have been popular across Asia. I would love to know your thoughts
An anime/manga series I always recommend for anyone starting out is Ouran High School Host Club. It's a comedy that makes fun of the romance genre and ultimately makes you feel so happy at the end of the day :D
Hi JENN! i think you should read  re jane a novel by Patricia park!\ni've been really enjoying Korean American authors after reading your recommendation shelter\nLet me know how you like it! :) Love your favorites videos!\nAlso, can you do a tutorial video on your makeup look you have on in this video! love you!!
There is an anime called orange, it's so emotional and heartbreaking but also inspirational. I feel like it's super underrated as well!! I think you would enjoy it ❤️ i only watched the show but there is a manga series of it :)
please do makeup tutorial on this look!!!!!
First person to make IT not sound scary. Now I want to watch it !
Jen you look so cute with those bangs
i need her necklace! where can i customize my own??
You need to watch Death Note it's super good!!!
I’d like you to put subtitles in English!!actually i always enjoy your video but just i wanna study english by watching your video at the same time!haha todays yours is awesome as well❤️
I would love to help out with the captions! I can speak Japanese so if you need help with that I’m down to help💗💗
Where is your necklace from?
Never did I think i would hear anyone call Ryuk endearing
I've never gotten into mangas but I do watch animes; I'm so glad you got into Death Note !! It's one of my first and it just blew me away. Definitely watch the anime Jen! ❤️
love love love all your favorites!
Jenn, I love your content but I'm a translator and I feel really uncomfortable about this free-service thing. I am aware most youtubers are not in a position to pay to get their videos translated into every language, but big youtubers can surely choose one language based on their audience, then get a professional to do the job.\n\nNot only does that guarantee the quality of the service (which will in turn contribute to further growing views), but it is the ethical way to go. Mundane as it may seem to many, audiovisual translation is an actual job that should not go underpaid, let alone unpaid. And while many claim being bilingual is all it takes to do it, it takes a pro to do it well. There is only so many characters the human eye can read per second, and if you translate from English to say, Spanish, which requires some 25% additional words to express ideas, then you need somebody with optimal summarizing skills who can also keep the content short without losing the essence of the original message.\n\nThis is not like asking someone to hit the like button or share a video, this is asking someone to work for free. On behalf of the translators and interpreters' community, please do reconsider your request. Thank you.
My favorite is basically watching your monthly favorites haha!!
I'm surprised there aren't more people recommending Shokugeki no Soma.\nIt makes you look at food in a different way, and they include recipes that are doable.\nI would say if you can get past the first episode, then you can handle the rest of the anime.\nAlso season 3 is coming out this month :D\n\nOr... you could read it too. Definitely not a family friendly show :P
Netflix made a jive American version of Death Note. I didn't know it was based on a manga until my daughter schooled me on the series. I read Wild a few years ago, they made a motion picture out of it. It's on video now. Also read It years ago , it's one of Stephen King's scariest books! I really wanna see the movie. I always look at captions too!!
Death Note!!! Sounds awesome, can't wait to get my hands on it!
Was Vetements your inspiration for the Eggie Long sleeves? They look incredibly similar
I'm SO into podcasts lately. You should listen to Dirty John by the LA Times!!!!!! SO GOOD SO FAR
That burp at the end though
I'm Japanese and I always get asked if I watch/read anime/manga every damn time lol. I love Studio Ghibli but that's about all I was into, but my boyfriend got me to watch Sword Art Online and I really liked that (the first season was the best, got a little eh after haha) and Attack on Titan is incredible of course but it also made me so depressed so I could only take so much haha. Even though it's not true asian anime, just in the same style, I LOVE Avatar: The Last Airbender. The storyline, the characters...it's a goddamn masterpiece lol.
You'll love Sword Art Online as well!!! Very high recommendation
my biggest fave of the month has been rick and morty! jenn if you dont already, please watch it 🙏🏼
I've never heard of butt hole lips!!! I'm dying omgahhh 😂😂😂😂😂😂 and just the way you said it..... 😂😂😂
you should watch Death Note (anime and the movie) on Netflix!
Just read Death Note online!!!
Omg yes please reduce the shipping rate, it costs more than the try again t-shirt :( I want to buy from Eggie but the shipping rate is not letting me buy anything :'(
I suggest you to watch the movie Wild too. It's just as amazing as the book!!
I love your book recommendations!!
I was so surprised to see you reading Death Note on your insta story. I grew up watching anime and reading manga so i was happy to see one of my favorite youtubers reading a manga. If you are looking for a romance manga to read, I recommend Hana To Akuma. Sadly its not in book form so you have to read it online. And for anime, I feel like you would enjoy Psycho Pass because of the concept and plot it goes by. And Shokugeki no soma is one to watch. Just be sure to eat something before or during cause it will make you hungry. Love you Jenn!
LOLLL butthole lips. I'm dying Jenn, it's so accurate but I've never heard that term before HAHAHAHA <3
I'm also a fan of manga, and Death Note. If you enjoy reading it, there's an animated adaptation on Netflix that is equally entertaining. I recommend it. Love your favorites, it's fun to see what you like each month!
Check out the 'my favorite murder' podcast!! It's to die for, pun intended.
That close up of you is pure beauty
If you love Cheryl Strayed, listen to her podcast Dear Sugar.
butthole lips? that's what it's called? lol
The Death Note anime is really good, too! Also Netflix just made a live action version but I haven't watched it yet. Willem Dafoe is Ryuk!
I'm so glad you loved Death Note :D its one of my fav <3 Honestly Light is my favourite character :P
Love that you wear berets!  My mom and I own them but I barely wear them because you don't see them here in GA!  And!  I LOVE that you talk about butthole lips 😂 I use that term and people are like, whhhhaaaattttt? 😂
Jenn, love your videos and content! Have you ever considered avoiding fashion that uses animal skins/furs? There are so many amazing animal-free leathers out there now! Would love for you to give your opinion on some of the products you like!
Hi Jenn! Happy belated birthday month. Love your videos. I'm curious to know how many people have the same birth date as you cause I'm one of them! So I was really surprised when you had the same bday as me. Anyways keep up the great content!
Hi Jen! I want to help you out and tranlate your video How I Became More Confident on Spanish (the others already have the subt) but it doesn`t hive me the option to do it... anyway, greatings from Argentina!
omg i read deathnote in middle school and loved it
Same Jenn!! Id i ever watch an horror i would remember  it forever and i wouldn't remeber other genre movies 😂😂😂❤❤
Love the sept favourites!! Any new youtubers?? Would love to meet some! I sub back 😁💖💖💖
I love Amy and her channel! I agree, I also think she's a pot of knowledge :)!
hey jenn!! i highly recommend you to read the fullmetal alchemist manga!! it's about two brothers who experiment far too deeply in alchemy which ends up backfiring on them (basically one loses their arm and leg, and the other loses their entire body). so they set out to find a way to restore their bodies and along the way uncover a huge plot that threatens their entire country. it's a really great read that deals with A LOT of themes such as war, racism, science vs religion etc. hope you'll find time to check it out!! :)
you're so GORGEOUS, I can't omg
Butthole lips is such a good description, yup. Lol. I totally nodded when you said scary images get burned in your head - im the same! Esp in the shower 🤡
The anime to Death Note is pretty good as well! I know you'll love it.!
Yay! This is my birthday month too. Love you Jenn!
Omggggg. You need to watch the movie! I LOVE DEATH NOTE weirdly because I have never read or liked any other manga stories. The movie is pretty old and when i watched it, it just blew me away.
So cool you are getting into manga. There are so many good ones out there, have fun discovering them all!
Jenn what is your shoe size?
thanks jenn for your efforts on eggie and understanding the pain of international shipping fees!!! LUV U!!! keep rocking <3
They came out with a new Death Note movie on Netflix!
I love your video! :) I really enjoyed reading that comic! if you are interested in it, I recommend the movie based on the comic as well! The actor playing 'L' was incredible! \nI hope I can buy your clothes from Korea soon! love you xxx
It's an anime..
Finally turned the translation thing on! I’ve sent emails to you to offer the Chinese transportation just didn’t get any confirmation back.
Death Note is SO GOOD HAHA there are movies on it too!
I'll be honest- I'm not digging the leather beret but you do you. But that headband looks so cute !!!
Jenn.... If you're just now entering the world of manga and anime, I'll tell you this now. It's a blackhole. But a good blackhole.
Good job with that burp! Hahahaha love you jenn!
there is a live action movie to the death note series
what are you wearing on the lid!!>?
I love Ryuk 💗 death note is so good
Same thing happens to me when I wash my face 😂 It's the worst!!!
Yay i'm so happy for a new video and you look amazing 😍
Just a warning for Death Note if you're going to watch the anime (and I think it applies to the manga too). You should probably stop reading/watching after the end of the first part, you'll know when that is. The second part is nowhere near as good as the first part, it kind of ruined it for me imo.
OMG you are sooooooo beautiful!
You’re japanese??
omg girl! makeup tutorial, please!
I get triggered with DeathNote! (Luvvvvv it)
Epic burping gurl! oh and I ordered some Eggies today!
Omg, I freaking love Death Note! <3
BUTT HOLE LIPS IM WEAK LOL
The burp at the end though. Hahah thanks Jenn!
LMAO butthole lips.. HATE that!
ITS JUSTICE
Does Eggie have door to door shipping to Cebu, Philippines, Jenn? :)
do a clothing haul!
I love your faves!
eye makeup tutorial please !!
DEATH NOTE <3
This video was so boring :(((((
Jenn! You should definitely watch the anime once you're done with the manga! It's a fantastic series as well.  When I was in middle school, Death Note was the first anime that I ever watched! Love you lots!! <3 and happy belated birthday!  :)
i can't say no to you jenn i have been knowing you since the beginning i love you so much and i love your videos that's why i helped to translate this video into arabic it took me about two hours its the first time that i do this so yeah.. be happy and healthy.
I love your words but something in this video made me stop and go Oh hell no, he didn't just say THAT! It seems the FAVORITE excuse for White Shooters is that they are/were crazy. You NEVER hear that being said regarding Black shooters. Please consider that the White Shooters are indeed sane and knew what they were doing.
Thank you Trae, for NOT making this video about laughs and righteous indignation.  How many more horrific events have to occur before we engage in honest discussion about keeping our families safe?  I ADORE your rants and laugh my a$$ off every time I watch but the death and injury of 500+ people warrants a sincere approach.  Well done.
When a toddler at a in-home daycare shoots two other toddlers with a gun in the house...then something is WAAYYYYYY beyond FUCKED UP!
Watching this from Germany, and couldn't agree more with what you're saying. Thank you for making a point here, particularly with your personal background. We need more people like this standing up for the cause.\n\nOh and btw: I'm not saying that German gun laws are perfect, but at least we have some mechanisms in place that make it considerably harder for anybody to obtain firearms in the first place.
Trae, I wish you lived near me and were my friend. It's hard to find friends who make sense like you where I live.
you're foundation is broken man....
Background checks for Bump Stock devices would be a good start.
Mmmmmm mmmm you are way too clear in your mind and way too objective with your views on what the truth is about this topic. You are a libtard fella!  Just like me!  I have been thinking that someone should try to start a reaction to this shooting that could put pressure on American business to move against this insanity by forming an organization to support the prevention of anyone entering their premises with a gun. Put up detection and screen the people entering your store, theatre, or any private property that can make their own rules. Once enough business has joined it will finally bring some competition into the market place to provide safety for customers!  Tourism industry should also be a part of it!  I am pretty sure international travelers are going to be affected by this because there are a lot of them in LV. Remember when the MGM fire happened?  There was just a little movement to encourage installation of sprinklers for safety in hotels. It turned out that so many organizations threatened businesses with only placing their conventions in safe locations that almost every major hotel made the change. And that is a lot bigger investment than some scanners at entrances and a few sign, maybe in some instances even a security guard to stop anyone who sets off the alarm. Hell, the business could even threaten the offender with civil action and have the offenders pay for the cost. \n\nWhat do you think?  Why don't you use the idea in your show and on your channel!  As I have said before you are a breath of fresh air and I would like to see you become a major influence for better things for Americans!  Hell, you could have a way better America First policy than the Donald!  And I mean it. Plus he doesn't even rate in the excitement of young chicks department!
I'm in the extremely unusual (on the Internet, at least) position of being a dedicated, dyed-in-the-wool gun nut who HATES most Republican/rightist stances.  I consider myself a centrist/progressive and normally Trae here is my *man* ...but in this one instance I feel a desire to voice...not so much *objection* as conscientious counterpoint?\n\nPassing laws will not stop criminals from obtaining guns illegally, because criminals are people who do illegal things.  People have the strange notion that Cracking Down on Guns, making it incredibly difficult or even impossible to get guns, will stop gun crime in this country.  There are a number of reasons why this stance is flawed, and why I feel like blaming the guns for these shootings is missing the point.\n\n1.) there are already a banananillion guns in the U.S..  We don't need to be able to buy *new* ones in order for there to be plenty of firepower around for people to do each other in with.  Other countries can get away with no, our citizens will not ever be armed because they were never armed in the first place.  This country?  Not so much.\n\n2.) Firearms manufacturers have been making it a point to end-run firearms control laws since firearms control laws have been a thing.  Create a newer, stricter set of legal standards to define 'Assault Weapon', and firearms manufacturers can, will, and *do* figure out how to kajigger a new firearm such that it doesn't legally qualify as an assault weapon under those laws.  Whatever method is left for people to purchase Regular Sporting Guns with, firearms manufacturers will find ways to make those guns as close as possible to being the things people actually want to buy.  because that's how you make money as a firearms manufacturer - you make guns that people want to buy.\n\nMost importantly, 3.) The Vegas shooter's *guns* did not decide to kill dozens of people and injure hundreds more.  The Vegas shooter did.  As Trae himself pointed out, this is concrete evidence that the man was deranged.  And yet, rather than seeking to improve upon this country's *disgusting* infrastructure and methodology for finding, helping, or even restraining if no other choice is left to them, people with mental instability and other issues...folks want to lock up all the guns and tell perfectly healthy law-abiding citizens like myself who simply happen to enjoy shooting sports as a hobby that we're *all* deranged psychopaths who need our guns taken away and for all the other guns in the country to be melted down into commemorative spoons.\n\nControlling guns does not stop violent people from doing violent things.  Could gun laws in this country use revision?  Oh my GAWD yes; not only are they ineffective for the purposes that terrified/furious anti-gun citizens are asking of them, they're a confusing contradictory *mess* that's almost impossible to keep fully straight.  They've needed rewriting for decades.  But we shouldn't be talking about getting rid of them or making them impossible to own without jumping through hoops so high and on-fire that no one bothers.  Gun ownership is indeed part of American culture, one of the things that makes us *us*.  \n\nCan we do better?  Absolutely.  But I never shot anyone or anything that wasn't a target on a range post.  I don't hunt, I don't carry, I don't actually support the NRA despite my deep enjoyment of the hobby because those guys are just...no.  I'm a regular, sane, everyday Trae fan who can't figure out why Trump hasn't been impeached yet, has no idea why people can't get over their gender issues, and who just also happens to be into hobby shooting.\n\nWhy should I suffer, lose access to my favorite outdoor hobby, and suffer the same condemnation and scorn as a deranged criminal whose actions I detest and condemn as much as every one of you?
Thank you for always straight shooting it and not coloring over anything....
Keep up the good work Trae.
With you all the way, Trey. Keep proving all of us Southerners aren't all alike. We're not all GOP Trump/tea party supporters. Some of us believe in gun control. Some of us aren't racist. Thanks!
It's only important to ban guns when white people die. Black lives don't matter.
Just saying, but criminals kind of don't follow laws...
Go far enough left you get your guns back.  Do you really want to disarm the left when Trump sits in 1600 Pennsylvania Ave?
I like your comments. However, I have a suggestion for you to consider. Record a monologue without vulgarity.
Why is your shirt inside out Trae? Love you Trae!
So refreshing to hear someone with a southern redneck accent and a background with guns say it like this. Thank you.
Amen.  Nice to see someone with common sense.  New subscriber.  Fact is both sides need compromise.  10 round clips and one gun a month.  Whats out there already stays out there.  The ATF needs to bury manufactures of these automatic conversion add ons.  You want 30 round clips and full auto, sign up and serve in the military.
I love this! I posted a rant on FB that says a lot of these same things. Thank you.
What I find so disturbing about pushback against common sense steps to control access to guns by those unfit to do so is the total lack of empathy on the part of those unwilling to compromise. I'd imagine that any 2nd Amendment advocate who lost a child, sister, mother, father or other loved one in Las Vegas would have a hard time arguing against closing the loophole in gunshow sales, internet sales and person to person sales today. Would have a hard time arguing against the outlaw of devices like the bumpstock or trigger crank, disallowing the sale of drum magazines or extended magazines. These are just common sense steps against items that should never have been allowed in the public domain in the first place. But until these people suffer through a tragedy like that in Las Vegas, Orlando, Virginia Tech or San Bernadino, they can't even begin to have a little empathy for their fellow human being and say, how would I REALLY feel if that happened to me or someone I loved. It can't alway be about ourselves and what we feel is best for us as individuals but needs to be about what is best for us as a nation and human beings. Great video, new subscriber here.
You make some great points and relate enough to start a conversation, I do disagree though ..only because it's not that the government won't tyrannically take over now it could happen years from now a century from now .. and it might not even be the government but an overthrowing of a country or a civil war of sorts or a revolutionary war ...but yes something has to be done !
Satan has been cast down to earth.  Greed and lust have always been with us, but what we are seeing right now is about impossible to explain any other way.  All the gun control in the world, and the cops still have guns.  This man could have easily qualified to become a police officer, had he set out to do so at some point earlier.  And he is not deranged.  This was planned years in advance.  He committed himself to serve Satan early on, and he did exactly that until the very end.
Nothing will change. It will be thoughts and prayers everybody will look appropriately solemn for 10 minutes, then screw that back to normal.
It's more attitude than anything.  Take, for example, when your grandfather was young.  Guns were not glorified nor was violence, most people hunted, even city folk.  This is the difference of today when most don't actually know how to handle firearms safely nor are the people who commit such tragedies getting the mental health care they need to prevent an horrid crime such as the Vegas Shooting.  That is where the line should be drawn.  Gun control just slaps and band aide on the symptom and does not address the underlying disease.  That and manufacturers should stop producing such overly powered firearms to begin with, if they didn't exist, they wouldn't get used.
Keep up the fight for sanity!  And you are awesome!
I have a suggestion, how about a 30 day no wait, a 90 day wait to purchase a gun. Oh that'll never happen. Instead I say let's repeal the 2nd amendment. LIke that would ever work.
You are a great voice of reason! This should be seen by many more people.
Seems simple keep guns out of the hands of demotards since all these mass shooters are democrats and your about as redneck as Jimmy Kimmel I think if you actually fired a gun you would fill your loafers full of piss how about if we ban all assault rifle because they sure as shit won't be flowing in over the boarder like the drugs and illegal immigrants so that way all the criminals can have them and the law abiding citizens cant maybe start with the media and the hate baiting this guys a democratic extremist or has ties to radical islam
Once again you nail it.  Wonderful nuanced interpretation (from a fellow gun-owning liberal, living in the South for 20 yrs) of a very difficult situation.
Ignorance is when you don’t even know what you don’t know. There is an extreme amount of ignorance expressed and exposed when it comes to the issue of guns and gun control mania.
I liked that one joke. You are funny. Lol lol 😂
Thank you, Trae.  I wish you were crazy enough to run for office.
Why don't we have a real investigation into all of the mass shootings because I get the feeling we haven't heard the truth on any of them and no I don't trust fox
the gun lobbyist will never let it happen.. they want to legalize silencers... fackin silencers!
Oh crap. I thought this was the show you made after the last big mascal.
Trae Crowder, we already try.  There are background checks.  Full auto is illegal.  Be detailed.  What is you want that we don't already have?  This guy was rich, with no criminal record, and apparently did a passable impression of sane person.  Be specific, what do you want?  Then we'll dismiss your ideas when they involve a full registry (which allows for gun confiscation in the future) or a total gun ban in the present.
And what is your plan? Let the liberals decide who is mentally fit to own a gun? The same people who think there are 13 different genders and who think it's okay to put 8 year old kids on hormone treatments and gender reassignment surgeries? Are you retarded?
I love what he's saying, but I'm just wondering... Is there a reason why his shirt is inside out?
So let me get this straight. You want to take away weapons from people who are under an oppressive government, who murder blacks on an epidemic proportion by police who are militarized, serving a country who invades foreign land for oil? I have news for you, emotional idiots... resistance cant be won with pussy hats.... btw, that was all sarcasm... but your logic has a major hole.
Thank you, Trae, for this video.\n\nI was attending an overnight training conference with my work group when we got news about this shooting.  One of my colleagues really pissed me off when she went on her right wing rant.  If there had just been a good guy with a gun, this all could have been prevented.  If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.  It took a lot of restraint not to say something...\n\nLike you, I am fed up with all the excuses people keep giving once these mass shooting happen.  Then we have the sniping back and forth between left and right over access to firearms.  Sorry, but firearm ownership is not and never will be illegal in this country.  But yes, guns DO kill people, and no, one good guy with a gun would have done NOTHING in this instance.  For God's sake, these mass shootings are not the price of freedom, people.  Like Trae said, when the fuck is enough going to be enough for the gun nuts in the NRA?!?  You might still be harboring illusions of fending off tyranny from the gubmint, but the rest of us not living in Fantasy Land are tired of the carnage.
we really must do something about that people, otherwise God forbids, we or our loved ones could be the next shooting victims.
There was another shooting where 3 died & two were hurt, that would have been in the news, if not for this horrible tragedy. Some twenty-somethings were leaving a bar in Lawrence KS, after celebrating the start of the KU Jayhawks basketball season. They were just having fun, like I did many times when I was a student there. There was a fist fight going on outside & one stupid a-hole pulled a gun. The mom of one victim is an ER nurse in KC. She had suggested going out in Lawrence, because the bar district in KC tends to be more dangerous...😔 BTW, Kansas has permit- free concealed carry & all state university campuses have to allow concealed carry, too. 2nd amendment rights are important, but why do some people act like they are the most or only important right to safeguard? What about the right to go to a freaking concert/ movie/ bar without getting killed for no damn reason?! 💔
Just an excellent speech, Trae. I hope it sparks some people to at least think about the madness of these massacres and change their thinking on this issue rather than just dismissing it out of hand. Of course, I thought gun laws would change when the children at Sandy Hook were slaughtered, but it didn't make one bit of difference. I'm becoming numb to shootings because it's just so fucking frustrating that nothing ever changes. But I do really appreciate this and all of your videos, and hope that you continue to speak out. (And just for your information...normally, you are very funny. Screw the haters!)
Hopefully a white guy takes care of you too. All of you left wing racists need to be corpsed.  Go white guys!
As always, spot on!
Seems to me, given the choice between the freedom to have a barrel and the person at the end of it to have a life? Rather obvious one would think.
gun control does not work in my country.
Good stuff. there, Trae, as always... but what is sad is that not even Sandy Hook could move the NRA and the gun nuts.  If a couple dozen kindergartners mowed down doesn't do it, what will?  What ELSE has to happen?  Not saying nothing can be done because I believe something can... just what's it going to take, you know?  :: sigh ::
I’m sorry but if conservatives don’t change their minds when kids are massacred in a school I don’t think they ever will
ok, propose something that would have solved this situation.\nhere is one problem. laws can not prevent anything, they provide consequences, and when someone is willing to die committing a crime, laws become meaningless. \nthere is an aweful lot of murder that happens in this country,  maybe we should do something about that. maybe make it illegal?
Money in politics, like every other problem. No rational discussion when gun lobby money, or pharma lobby money, or bank lobby money. All political discussions are full of lies and misdirection to protect the status quo. Decades later our media is ahead of the game keeping Americans dumber and divided so the exploitation continues.
wish I could live rather than like this.  reason.  reality.  common sense. \nthank you.
Yup! It's gotten way too easy for any asshole to quickly and efficiently kill lots of regular folks. We have rights too!  We gotta fix this.  No excuses. Take a good look at the children, then write your congress folks. Now. We can do this.
It seems as though anyone who doesn't want anything done about guns always say how criminals will get their guns no matter what... The problem is that plenty of mass shooters obtained their weapons through completely legal means because of the lax gun laws we have. No one is saying to get rid of guns, but I want to know how asking for more care in the laws is asking too much.
Is this satire? I think this guy once shown to be a typical redneck. His views are supposed to be the opposite of what he says. \n\nMiddle ground? You libs have one idea of compromise, BAN ALL GUNS, NO HUNTING, NO SELF DEFENSE, NO NOTHING, BAN THEM ALL, NO EXEPTIONS, EXECUTE THE ONES WHO RESIST!!!\n\nConservatives have a similar middle ground: FROM MY COLD, DEAD HANDS, TRY TO TAKE MY GUNS AND YOU ALL WILL SEE CIVIL WAR 2.0, AND THE PATRIOTS WILL POUR OUT THE MOUNTAINS!!!\n\nNo one will reach any proverbial middle ground, there will never be compromise from EITHER       SIDE, and in the end, nothing will change. All the rhetoric, hate mongering from the left and the right, and threats from both sides will fix nothing. \n\nFeel free to speak this stupidity in an echo chamber, where you will never hear objection, no liberal has EVER entertained an alternate point of view, niether has any conservative. \n\nIf you think that the moniker Liberal makes you trendy, realize that you are one side of a filthy coin that does nothing but stain the hand of America.
Sometimes the truth is not funny . Sometimes the truth is 33,000 American Civilians shot dead a Year. Sometimes it is 90 American Civilians a day shot dead.  Most years 15 times as many Civilians are Shot dead here as Service Members are killed in Combat out of our 1.4 Million United States Military. Thank you Trae for not only being Bright and funny but for being honest. It is always a pleasure to listen to real talk about this issue. :) Thank you Trae. :)
keep up the great work Trae
Thank you, Trae. Well done. Damned shame this even had to be said. We don't have to all be selfish sonsabitches who won't see the light until one of their own family's shot at a concert, or out doing some Christmas shopping or just walking down a street. The problem's not the venue or the color of the shooter or even the reason why. It's the damn guns.
I feel ya! Im a gun nut just as much as the next dude.... But this shit is seriously getting out of hand. I would gladly give up my wasr-10 and sig sauer if it met less shootings. I mean for suks sake thos dude had enough to stock a small militia.... One person could only use that shot for one thing.
Ban semi-automatics,  the stock conversion to fully automatic, and universal background checks. It's a place to start and should be easy. Like Trae said, can't we at least try?
I don't even want to ban all guns.  What I really do want is sensible controls over semi-automatic guns.\n\nHell, if you still had to pack down the powder, like you did when the second amendment was written, I'd be fine if everyone had a gun. The technology of guns has changed, but the constitution right to guns is seen as an absolute.  It's broken, and needs to be fixed!
I want to traah.. let's traah, trae
( This guy had explosives because he was rich are you people deranged? Guess who else is rich and has explosives and doesn't mind collateral damage involving innocents....hmm which group of people could I be talking about?? )
You hit the nail on the head! \nCant get any more obvious that we have a huge problem with not only guns but racism, being bias, and simply covering up the truth. Unless  and until we admit there's a problem we won't ever be able to fix the problem. We must start with... Hello, I'm American and if you have one drop, I'm not gonna like you...
Always speaking the fucking truth👏🏼 You're amazing. Keep it up. 💕
WTF happened to the well regulated militia
Something has to be done ..... liberals and democrats should never be allowed to own guns.... the most mass shootings are done by liberal cuckolds.... ZERO first and second amendment rights to liberals and democrats .... they ALL need to be rounded up and put in a camp tomorrow.....
Two words: NRA Lobbyists..... \nStop the lobbying and corporations are people bullsh** and let's see what happens!
Guns should be limited to pistols and shotguns if that ain't enough to defend your property i don't know what is, anything like assault rifles should be limited to gun ranges, and to the argument we need ar-15's to fight a tyranical goverment what makes you think your gonna stop a fighter jet or a tank with it things have changed since 1776 and a civil war between the government and citizens would have a much diffrent outcome in the 21st century
I say there all crazy bastards. It ain't the guns fault that there's 58 deaths. It's the dumb LIBRAL bastard that wanted republicans dead. There doesn't need to be a change of guns. What we really need is to change the minds of crazy idiots.
You can talk till your blue in the face!
I'm with you, Trae!
This is what the majority of americans believe, here's the  shocking part, because its the truth..... the nra and conservatives that are supported by the nra, thats financed by gun companies, anything that could hurt theyre sales is unacceptable, so they lie, saying theyre wanting to take away our guns... because a lie is the only thing to argue with the truth
All comes down to lack of Jesus Christ. Period
Trae, I agree with you to an extent. However, let me pose something to you.\n\nThere exists a group of bikers called BACA. It stands for Bikers Against Child Abuse. They are not vigilantes. They work within the bounds of the law. I am not a member, so I cannot really speak for them about what they do. I can however direct you to this official video... watch?v=hLIyUfsDyeE\n\nOnce you've finished watching that, consider that the moment someone becomes a member of BACA and puts on the vest with the patches on it, they become a target to perps who want to undermine BACA's mission because they don't want their victims to testify, and intimidation is pretty much the only way they can do that.\n\nAs such, BACA members are sometimes targeted by perps. Imagine if a perp got ahold of one of those vests from a different chapter. They could go up to the kid with the vest on and be like hey kid, look what I'm a member of now and undermine the kid's trust in the organization.\n\nSo in order to protect children, they have to be prepared to defend not just the child's life with their own, but their own life with their own.\n\nI know you're not saying that guns should be banned entirely, but suppose they WERE banned. You're intelligent. I respect your intelligence. So I expect you understand that if guns are banned, it won't magically make guns disappear. It'd just make it more difficult for guns to be obtained, but not out of reach of organized crime, or people who know organized criminals.\n\nConsidering that child prostitution is something that when it happens, is usually the result of organized crime, such a ring would have the resources to have guns. Again, BACA are not vigilantes, but are sometimes targeted by criminals for many things, including even simple revenge. A perp isn't going to sit around and wait for the cops to arrive, so if a member of the organization is attacked, they need to be able to defend themselves\n\nSo with that in mind, should people like BACA not have access to the tools they need to defend themselves against perps?\n\nThe question ends up being... what can be done to prevent people like that accountant son of one of the FBI's most wanted from having access to guns that would not also disarm good, hard working, law abiding citizens who have a legit need for guns like BACA from being able to arm themselves against criminals?\n\nI don't think there is anything. I think tragedies like this are something we have to accept as a part of the dangers of living in a free society. There are societies with less mass murder, like Japan, Switzerland, and others, but those are societies with fewer freedoms.  Japan for instance doesn't even have laws prohibiting racial discrimination.
Right. Thank you. This should be getting way more views.
Everyone needs to watch this again: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OZIOE6aMBk
Thank you. YES. Thank you! There has got to be some sort of way to deal with our gun issues, there should be a middle ground, and there was another mass shooting the next day KS.  You're spot on, thank you for addressing this. Why no one wants to talk about guns we have people out there talking about HOTEL SECURITY, really?? another shooting but we are worried about HOTEL security?????
figuring out who can have a gun and who can't is going to be massively complex. of course it's necessary, but it will take a long time for people to agree on it. far too long when you take into consideration the politicians who are 100% against gun control. I'm mentally ill and I come from a long line of hunters, which makes it complicated to figure out exactly what precautions I would like to see put in place, but they have to do something.
I love you, Trae. Please keep preaching! And how about running for office?
Love this guy, he is my redneck crush!
The whole what about cars, those have been used to kill people? argument is... I mean, yeah. But killing people isn't a car's primary purpose. They're vehicles, they move people and stuff around. Properly used, they're harmless. Whereas the primary purpose of a gun is to kill, and properly used, they kill.
Larry the Cable guy wants his comedy routine back you fake ass faggot.
Amen
Thanks
We love you, Trae!
I keep hoping
Thank you
Your shirt is inside-out.
I agree completely.
Amen!
Keep preaching Trae.
Agreed
Nailed it once gain Trae. Love ya.
love you, trae
I agree
Well said!!
Thank you, Trae.
Attaboy, Trae!  Please follow up with a bit of commentary regarding the Big Orange Carrot's post-disaster-scene visits.  You calm my heaving stomach.
SNL tries so hard to keep up and be funny but it is just so lame and unfunny as fuck. I had people tickling me while I was watching this and I still couldn't laugh. - Blake Stackhouse
 We have to stop governing by crisis . --  President Obama
This was spooky Just in time for Holloween
What happened to cuckabee's lazy eye?
TaLLIEsALLEY you are clearly of superior intellect by comparison to me or the other commentators on this you tube channel.  That is why you are so passionate about possibly the most repetitive sketch in the history of sketch comedy itself.  I suppose that is also why you attacked my intelligence while criticizing me for doing the same in a comment.  So just to make sure I understand correctly what your sentiments are based on your mindless diatribe of a response....... If I question someone's intelligence than I'm of inferior intellect and I'm an idiot....but if in a response to me you literally do the same thing than it's somehow not the same thing that you chose to criticize me for ?  Hmmmmm I think that is called hypocrisy and that you should think before you post you cretin.  Seems to me to be a totally circular argument on your behalf at best.  By the way Alec Baldwin is only cashing checks right now because of Trump and this impersonation so maybe a thank you is in order.  I am not even a Trump supporter but I know when I'm watching someone beat a dead horse.  Funny once not 36 times and counting.....good sketch comedy is about creativity
Yes we get it you don't like the guy but can we move on and do something else.
Trump we need someone with a real brain not a Georgia pecan sized one
Just another media avenue for the NWO people to discredit our current elected President.  What a pathetic attempt to sway our views.  Read American Free Press newspaper to read what is really going on in our country, it is True News.
Kate McKinnon as Jeff sessions is hilarious
You would have to be a total brain dead moron to find this funny.  Real humor in satire is when you actually parody real life people, not when you satirize an already satirized image--you lose the punchline as well as the power of any joke.  I laughed at no part of this.  Great job once beloved SNL.  Clap... clap... yawn.
This is suppose to be funny???
Is this all they have on this show, now? is this it?
I saw this in a store.
this one was kinda dumb
Okay we can't help everyone and we are already on so much debt that Obama caused.
These skits are hilarious but aren’t they getting old? I mean the guy has been in the White House for almost a year now can’t we move on to something else.
Am I the only one that thinks he's not funny as trump?
The thumbnail looked like gordon ramsay.
is this what comedy accounts for in the USA. Jesus christ this is awful
funny how that leftist mayor was able to get a new custom t-shirt everyday
just like in the real elections the yes votes win lol

Is snl going to make a skit throwing paper towels at everyone?
Its good to see Alec Baldwin working again. Trump single handedly resurrected his pathetic career. He does a good Trump.\nI would like to see another actor play Baldwin smacking around Kim Basinger & screamimg and cursing out his 13 year old daughter. Or beating & spitting on photographers. That would be some funny shit.
Saturday Night Live  has turned into the LOSERS CLUB.
😎  Alan Baldwin   ugly like  his mother. &  his mother's look so   nasty.👾👿👽👹👺👈🐽🐷🐖🌚🚽🚾  on the show SNL  thought it was so funny for him to play at  child molester\nthey find that playing as a pedophile child molester somebody that does evil two little kids and tear of the body  &  mine up  mangles  up for a life \n think to  guy that owns the show. and the producer and director and the owner of the SNL  obviously  Man   don't like Jesus Christ. What do U OUT OF  thing like that. thinks it's funny to be A  child molester I wonder if. all Jew   feels that way I just him . .\nNasty  looking eyebrows
Not funny disgraceful, why do people think this is helping our nation. He was voted to be our president. Obama was not treated this way.
All SNL does is make fun of Trump literally, don't you have anybody else to make fun of like Clinton or Obama? Damn
haha snl great again thanks president trump haha.
FUCK SNL!!!!!!!
Donald drump best president ever ✌✌✌✌✌💪💪💪💪💪💪👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
This hate keeps Trump re-elected in 2020. Keep it up lefties. Doubt me?\n Remember this blast from the past! WE do. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html?mcubz=1
i dont even care if you agree with me, i wish non of you dont have to live what Puerto Rico its going thougth rigth now.its nosense making fun of a tragedy where lots of family lost everything when they even dont have to eat nothing, water its not running country its completely dark. where people its dieying. so sad to se usa only use PR for their convinience and not helping like we are expecting because if they dont do it we will never recover from this  PEOPLE INFORM YOURSELF BEFORE MAKING FUN OF THE TRAGEDY OF THE OTHER ONE BECAUSE WHEN YOU DONT YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM TOO
This guy is cringy af. Tv is dead
At least it's not Hillary
So this is about the michelin man playing Jaba the hut? Alec Baldwin is such a fat asshole and such a fucking piece of shit. The only thing he did in his in entire shitty career of shitty movies, and the only actual acting he's done is when he played himself in Glengary Glenross. Seriously, who the fuck watches Saturday Night Live, this show has been horrible, unfunny garbage for decades!
So when will kim jong un make an appearance on snl?? 😁
How did they get Kate McKinnon to look so much like Jeff Sessions?? \nAlso that line at 4:44 had me screaming with laughter! 😂😂😂 I might look adorable, but I am fu-rightening! 😂😂
This is not Humor, not anymore that is. Look at your comments. You make fun of Trump, makes you laugh. I disagree with it ,but it's your right. But you also insult the Americans that voted for him as well. Insults, name calling, labels etc. America voted. As Americans always have. Trump won. This kind of so called comedy is not helping, it's dividing us even more. I use to like watching SNL, but it's turned into a platform for Liberal hate and insults. I'm sure I will get names and insults thrown at me for posting this. But like you, i have something to say. Really look at these comments. Stop picking sides. Taking sides=separation. Both sides need to work on this.
the jeff sessions acting was some of the weirdest and most awkward acting ive ever seen. i couldnt even finish it
Why Hollywood didn’t made a movie about this. Alec Baldwin could win the Oscar prize
Simply go to google and simply type: *gexxguides* You'll get the only working clash of clans working tool by 2017
Alec Baldwin has to be one of the worst actors of all time. Watch some of his old movies and marvel at his cheesy, over-acting. Thank God he has no reservations about shilling for the leftist cause, otherwise he would have been washed up years ago.
I'm happy that we have Trump
You are a child. Alec Baldwin you are a moron. Dressing up as a real president...you have all your facts wrong its sick. SNL put down the meth pipe and dope...your an embarrasment
Lame. Y'all need new content.
Hmmm I am not able to watch this video it's gets stuck on the advertisement 🤔🤔
They gave *this* an Academy award? Pathetic. I've seen pantomimes with better acting.
Oh fuck the way he lifts her off his lap that was hilarious hahahaha

Stop i can't breath!!plz leave Trump alone before you drive him to push the shiny HUGE!!RED BUTTON
Really good. These folks are nailing it.
Trump supporters don't respect the First Amendment.
Baldwins Trump impression is just terrible once you have seen Anthony Atamanuiks. Every other Trump impression looks awful compared to his.
This was too funny, I hope they mock this faggot until he gets the fuck up out of office
Mrs Clinton..... you(trump) are deplorable.......Rex Tileson,trump moran . Mr.Reveras,(trump) is a pussy grabber. Repoblicans,we have morols. End of fake RELIGION......Athiesm strong

welcome back to saturday night propaganda
Snl and colbert have the cure for the trump presidency
SNL is a real trip they have totally no respect for anyone insulting with stupid comedy and think this funny skit is going to make them any funnier than they are.\nIn fact they are really insulting and needs to stop this bullshit with the Trump joke already.
Little Rocket Man lmao
What a schmuck! Impeach this cheeto!!
#JimmyKimmelisanidiot
This guy is the biggest hypocrite on the planet.  How dare he talk shit on Mr. Trump when he said this to his\nown little girl in 2007.\nyou rude thoughtless little pig - Alec Balwin 2007 said to his 11 year old daughter 2007 on a voicemail.\nAlec is a no talent fraud... https://youtu.be/lgj6NEk9xEw?
Wow, SNL gets more pathetic with each episode.  It's not because they are doing this against Trump, but it just isn't funny, period.  Alex Baldwin does a horrible attempt at portraying Trump.  Political satire can be funny, when it's someone with talent doing it, but not these untalented hacks.  Dana Carvey, Chevy Chase, and Dan Aykroyd for example, could poke fun at both republicans and democrats and be hilarious with it.
This is absolutely hilarious!!! AWESOME job guys!! :) :) :) :)
Tht shit was funny as hell.
Because he didn’t like country music
I can't believe things like this happen
Well alot of Asians are Euro worshippers anyway so it really isn't a surprise
I don't think she knew. She was in the Philippines for 2 weeks before this happened.
a lot of people said she would not go back to the US. now what?
Give that passenger chick a book deal.
she just happens to be out of the country and had money wired to her prior to this? hmm something seems off
I have to wonder where this number of $100,000 sent to the Philippines comes from and if that information was fact checked by these news outlets that have been reporting it. I lived in the Philippines and I don't believe you can send that much money to that country in particular. It is more likely that as is typical in the Philippines, Filipinos may refer to the Peso as dollars. It could be that he wired P100,000 (about $2,000), although it could be difficult to even wire that much with the new laws in place to prevent outsiders funding potential terrorist groups.
She’s ISIS and had pics of him in panties.  Case solved.
why do they put her face up like a mug shot? she didn't do anything...she's not a suspect..ruin her life pin head fake news
How much you wanna bet they torture her into confessing, then this whole thing gets wrapped up in a neat little bow?
She doesnt have to answere anything at all,If i were her id say to the media and police.....Hi and just stare at them... or tell them to go get donuts and coffee......
American media is so funny
I really hope antifa was behind this so we can label them as a terrorist group
Get her tf out of LA lmao. We don’t want her ass here
$100,000????? She can now fulfill her dream of opening a nail shop in the lobby of the Mandalay Bay Hotel #Winning
1:24 what kind of cosmetics are you using on your eyebrows they look nice.
The media will blame her, the shooters brother, the shooters rough childhood and even the hotel and it's security..... But they won't blame the politicians who allowed high powered guns for civilian purchase huh.

Frikken media. That's all ya got? Wow. Yeah sure, Breaking news folks!!!!!!
False flag. Fake news at its best
lol person of interest wasnt in the country at the time of shooting
Anyone else think it strange that they're always choosing to show the pic of the scum where his eyes are closed? There's clearly another picture of him with his eyes open. Seems strange for news stations to be okay with the awkwardness of using that photo.
Las Vegas = Laws Vegas \n\nLas Vegas Gun Laws: Open Carry, Concealed Weapons, Machine Guns All Legal in Nevada. Nevada has some of the most relaxed gun laws in the country, a legislative condition that is sure to come under renewed scrutiny in the wake of the worst mass shooting in U.S. history.
How is this trending? They just showed her picture
A reporter with no news but a video clip showing us they don't have any leads. Sucks to be you.
Eww fake pug nosed make up gold digger. Don't trust foreign women boys.
Prayers for all affected.\n\nThe Lord Jesus Christ is coming, friends. \n\nThere is so much pain in this world, and things are going to get a lot worse. \n\nJesus died so that we may live. \n\nIn this world, even as a Christian, we are going to suffer pain and tribulation, BUT Jesus promised us that we will dwell with Him someday in a new place, a new heaven and a new earth. There will be no more pain or suffering. In fact, God Himself will wipe all tears from our eyes. \n\nSo please, if you don't know Jesus, call upon Him today. Repent of your sins and put your faith in Jesus Christ. He loves you, my friends. He is not angry at you, although the devil will have you to believe that He is. This is not true, because Jesus is waiting on you to call upon Him in Truth. \n\nHe is not a God who forces Himself on you, He is a God that respects your decision, but He has shown us that each decision we make has consequences. \n\nSo make the greatest decision of your life and make Jesus your Lord and Savior. You will be forgiven, you will be delivered, you will be set free. \n\nTrust in His Love. \n\nI pray you consider calling out to Jesus, because to die without The Lord is a very dangerous thing - there is a major consequence to it. \n\nShalom, friends.

I thought she was the wife, ex-wife, roomate. Now she's the girlfriend??
This is all fake, the guy was planted. There is much more to the story then the CIA is telling us.\n\nThe guy has no motive and it takes military or highly specialized personal to fire from 32 stories at that distance...\n\nDon’t be news fool...\nYou really think what is broadcasted on the news is true ?

What is breaking news?
Sorry to say she knows more than any one else so of course she’s going to be  interviewed. Did he tell her to take a vacation? Did she go to avoid the inevitable? Eventually we’ll know. Thank goodness we have the FBI and others to investigate. Don’t be so easily fooled you fools, mama taught me better.
I would of flew to Mexico and transfer my 100k and start a new like 🤤
Poor lady for returning back to US. The US government will cosfiscate hey property and money then lock her up for life.
So his brother and girlfriend didn’t know he would do anything like this? Sounds like that dude was an absolute master manipulator or these idiots are “protecting” him
Americans are so stupid
she looks like she doesnt give a fuck
They are wanting to require bag checks as a new practice in all casinos moving forward. Ok- so then what is the lag in requiring bullet proof windows and door locks in schools?! That needs to be implemented in all schools!
How does this stuff happen?
Please get right with God. Turn away from your wicked ways and repent. Please get saved and accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior. He loves you so much that he DIED for YOU!! He is COMING!!! We are in the end times with signs popping up more and more!! TIME IS RUNNING OUT, WOE UNTO YOU!!
yea she was probably apart of the Australian antifa like her sisters and most likely they were duped into thinking it was something it wasn't and the 64 year old man (who probably couldn't even hold a gun) was a pasty straw man so convenient he shoots himself and where are the bullet holes and who does crisis acting with a bunch of white people and explosives before a run of the mill concert ?? just think about it.....what is the real calibre and were there others? probably
WHO CARES!!!!! This was three days ago
She didnt know. How many serial killers live a normal life and their wife, family, and neighbors know nothing
I'm glad she's black dat means he shot them cause they was Republicans may the Lord give em a amazing gift.
She wouldn't be a 'person of interest' if she was white!!!!!!!!!
Leave her alone . she was in the Philippines .

This is just a bad year for everyone I guess. And I thought 2016 was garbage. It's just so sad that this is the world we're giving our children.
The woman is coming to the US to help /cooperate with the investigation even though she doesn't even live in the US. The good ol media trying to get this woman killed for dating the wrong guy.
When there is a crime such as this, ofcourse they eye and question the husbands, wives, family members, friends, or anyone connected or close to the suspect or criminal ya'll.
*_Never make a statement to the police, even if you are really innocent of any wrongdoing! She better lawyer-up!_*

One of the funniest videos at BufferFest
Surely someone will give her the USB, she'd probably take 2 USB's at the same time at this point.
She sure is the Apple of my i...Mac.
I love this so fucking much
This humour is just so smart, I love you guys!❤️

can we still resolve why Jack was drawing on chest hair with a permanent marker?
That's why i loved you guys for years now, you always have creative ideas that genuinely make me laugh :D
Lowkey wanna be that Computer at the end....
It all makes sense now, that's how people fuck their laptops
very Her. i liked it.
Loved this premiered at Buffer Festival and love it again!
i’m confused on what i should feel
Yes! What else would I be doing?\n--I laughed so hard my mom was concerned about me
What else would I be doing!!! than watching jack and dean videos all day
This was incredible! Also I'm always surprised by their accent lol why
The outro being parallel to the first shot was a nice touch. Lovely sketch!
Thank you for this 👌 content lmao
It took me so long to figure out it was Anna Akana's voice
Yo I'm new here, are they dating?
reminds me of spike jonze's Her
Should I be proud that jack & dean are on trending or concerned that 186K people watched a video about a man rubbing his dick against a computer??
this is the future millenials want
this is just the ultimate what the fuck video😂😂😂
Not the ending I was expecting.
Queue Bad Religion - I Love My Computer.
Welcome to the world of tomorrow. ..
Reminds me of an 07 - 08 YouTube. I have missed sketches like this. Nostalgic for me. glad I found this video
I can't believe this is #18 on trending!
and they say the perfect video doesn’t exist
WT FUCK IS THE END NO THERE IS A LINE THAT YOU CROSSED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI might watch that again
What the actual fuck
If that last bit wouldn't be there then this video would have been amazing
Lol I don't know what I just watched, but my boyfriend said I can never pick videos again...he can't stop me xD
Holy shit this is great 😁😁😁
Am I the only one that felt genuinely akward during that exchange?
OMG 😱! Am I the only one who felt that response when the laptop said it's... Different, ahhh man, that's when hell would've broken loose for me!
The fact that Anna is in this video, even just as a voice, makes me hate it!
This is the best thing ever XD
It's .... different. *flashbacks to the ross and rachel break up scene*
I've never seen this video nor do i know about these guys, but from the thumbnail I could tell they were British. Great video 👍🏼
These guys deserve so many more subscribers!
_I don't use Apple. I prefer Pear._
so the cult of apple has become a sex cult got ya.
That ending haha.. I just thought. He would be putting a usb in and out really fast..not fucking his computer haha
Watching your videos is always a bit wierd for me because my name is Dean and then to hear somebody say your name even though they aren't talking about you feels wierd.
Why is there Xmas songs in the background ?!
Check out my channel guys, subscribe if you find it interesting. THANKS!!!
Finally a new video \nI luv it
Ok that last part was so wrong.
Is this a new episode of Black Mirror TV show?
Is anyone else watching this on the same model?? Got mine back in 2011, still been running pretty well to this day. And to be completely honest I love the plastic white over the silver aluminum, looks and feels just a whole lot nicer.
How stoned were you when you thought of this video idea?
This is how I feel with my ancient dell. It weighs like ten pounds, but I heft it around. Not because I can't afford it, but because sentimentality, and plus all my stickers are on this computer. :'(
This reminds me of Humans on AMC
I feel like there is some sort of subtext I'm missing. Lol
Words do not describe
It would've been funnier if you guys kept the whole reference implied. Once you start saying things like polyamourus and dick... It breaks the joke quite a bit.
I have the same model as Dean does... Now I'm more self-aware of my self-conscious computer.
The camerawork is super shaky

First Self Conscience vampire from CollegeHumour and now this lol. Keep it up J&S
in belgium chimo is free to all
Are you trying to raise the full cost on your go fund me page ...or did you have health insurance to cover it?
British people, we’re so lucky to have the NHS!!!
This is what I really hate about America. Here in Italy it would have been free
YOUR SPEECH IS GETTING SO MUCH BETTER LOVE!!
Is this in US dollars?
omg I didn't know radiation was that expensive...I moved to australia and am doing radiation right now and will be done on monday (35 treatments total) America's healthcare system is a mess...
That is so expensive what the hell!! 😪
Reminds me if when my ex got sick and racked up about that much. Insurance reduced it to $4250. We ended up paying about $1000 of that after talking with the hospital. Now after telling my story I'm just going to say your really pretty and your freckles are awesome.
Oh. My. God. The United States medical care is so backwards. In Canada, all this treatment would be free of charge with the exception of prescriptions, which are usually reduced by 80% with most insurance programs. You also might have to pay for parking at the hospital... I'm so sorry you're incurring these costs, as if being diagnosed with brain cancer wasn't enough. Just awful.
i don't want to scare you or anything but it's better to be prepared right? cancer can or MIGHT come back ya know so maybe transfer to another country with better healthcare system or something IDK.. i guess what i'm really trying to say is to make a plan about financial stuff to prepare yourself in case... anyway i'm glad you seem to be doing great! 👊^-^
I have pretty good insurance thanks to my dad but after 2 emergency rooms visits ( I had to go a second time because they sent me home when I shoud’ve been admitted the first time) and I was diagnosed with a kidney disease called mgn and needed a kidney biopsy. I go to a nephrologist now and have to take chemo pills and prednisone as my treatment. After the bills started rolling in the total cost for everything was over $20,000 but after insurance I only have to pay a little over $4,000. But how is a college student expected to pay for that? It’s insane!
Here in Australia you wouldn't have had to pay 1cent towards it. I can't believe that on top of having to deal with having cancer and surgery you have to also worry about how you're going to pay for it all. My heart breaks for you.
You can file for medical bankrupty. Healthcare here sucks
Insurance company should cover all of it 😔 it’s not her fault she got cancer, why should she have to pay for all of this? It’s pretty bad you have to pay to keep yourself alive.
It is always sad to realize that only small amount of paid money will be given to ones that helped you the most.  And then it makes you think where is the rest and if it is worth it.
Obamacare is a disgrace I pay $600 a month for just coverage and I cannot afford to use it, the copay is so expensive. Life in America is very unfair.
I had to have an emergency surgery to save my life too.  I was literally dying from a perforated ulcer.  I was in sooooo much pain and discomfort and  too scared to go to the drs.  I couldn’t stop throwing up so my gramma called EMTs.  Had I waited a few more hours, I would’ve died I was so septic.  The surgery, therapy, aftercare, 15day Hospital stay etc totaled around $350,000.  I have medi-care like Senior citizens.  I was only 40, but I’m disabled.  After Medi-care paid, I had to file a Bancruptsy.  I get how costly this is and I’m sure your total is AFTER insurance
Wow!!! I hope your still had your teaching insurance!
You're saying radiation right!! Yayyy! Getting better day by day!
In Canada surgery is covered here with our tax dollars.
May God bless you and heal you!
You did a great job saying the numbers Courtney.  There are people who didn't have brain surgery, radiation and chemo therapy who can't say the large sums you did.  So kudos!\n\nMy Mom's first surgery at UCLA cost $77,000 or thereabouts but was covered by all the health insurance my Dad had taken out when they first got married.\n\nMy Mom's Second Brain Surgery and Hospitalization with Rehab way back in 1982 cost my parents $1.5 million after the first health insurance company paid. That includes, the surgeon's fees, ICU stay for a week, Regular room for 25 days then she was moved closer to Rehab and Occupational and Speech Therapy every from August 10th through October 15th.\n\nLuckily my Dad was a paranoid dude and he as a young man in the Navy he bought secondary, third, and fourth back up health insurance company.  He bought these back when he and my Mom were healthy young people with just one kid. Each successive kid (5 total) they added each of to the coverage.\n\nThe 2nd, 3rd, and 4th health insurance companies covered the $1.5 million. Each one paying their share. And oddly each one of those checks from the additional health insurance companies sent a check directly to my parents which they had to deposit into their back account then write a check to the hospital.  \n\nI don't think my parents expected this $1.5 million over 6 months influx of cash in their personal bank account to trigger an IRS Audit but oh boy did it. For three successive years my parents finances and taxes were Audited in person at the IRS office in Downtown LA.  And each year they marveled that my Dad's paranoia actually saved my Mom's life and kept our family untouched by the expense. \n\nMy Dad was clever and I don't think he ever expected to use the 2nd, 3rd or 4th health insurance policies. When he was active duty military for 25+ years all medical care for our family was covered even my second brother's childhood Heart Repair Surgery and aftercare. It was done at a Navy Base Hospital by Navy Doctors and the whole things was free.\n\nMedical cost out of pocket even with health insurance can be outrageous especially when its a surgery on the brain and requires additional treatment and rehab after but Courtney needs it so she can get her life back like my Mom got hers back.  I would ask that everyone that can give to Courtney definitely should give even if its just a few bucks.  I will give a few bucks at the end of the month after I set aside funds for my own surgery copays.
That's expensive. But to be honest it's no where near as expensive as I thought it would be. Especially for operating in the brain.
Thank you for addressing the issue of the burdensome cost of medical care. Did you have health insurance at the time or is the total out of pocket?
What's crazy is if just half of us (her subbies) just gave 1 dollar it would pay.for the whole surgery !!! So everyone just do a dollar and it will be totally paid for for Courtney I mean we can all spare one dollar and we all love her to pieces !! LETS DO IT GUYS
I will suggest you to go to India, as you will get all the facilities of a modern hospital with excellent expertise of doctors in just 1/3 of the price you pays there
The American health care system is so criminal... you guys shouldn't have to be paying for these kind of things. I'm thankful that I live in Canada and very thankful that everything here is covered and I don't have to pay a single cent. It's not fair that you have to pay thousands of dollars to get rid of something that's life threatening... I really hope that one day action gets taken and a better health care system gets introduced because like I said, this is just insane.
Your speech has improved so much! I watch every video of yours!
I will never understand how the US puts a price on a human life like that.. you are a slave to your own health and the bills that follow.
I had a different brain surgery
You didn't mention how much your insurance covered?
Start putting adds throughout your videos. I would happily watch an add to help at all. I’m so sorry for everything you’re going through. I’ve been watching you for a while now (about a year or more before you found out you had the tumor) and I love your videos. Look up to you so much for staying so strong.
Dang.\nWhen I was 5 I fell on the back of my head.\nDidn't get a concussion but did crack the back of my skull.\nStayed 5 days in the hospital and my mom was charged of 1k.\n(Didn't know why. Slept most of the time)\nOh yeah LOTS OF FUCKING BLOOD.
Hi court!! :) I’m glad to see you doing so much better girl and your speech is wonderful, it sucks to be in this financial struggle with all medical bills. Have you thought about getting Medi-cal? If you don’t know what is it you should look it up  we have that here in California. Also wondering with all those big bills how do you afford to buy expensive wigs?
I had scoliosis fusion surgery a few years ago and it costed $120,000. Thank God for insurance amirite😭
You are on the trending page
AAAAAAnd this is why I am studying to be a neurosurgeon
That's as expensive as my house.
You're doing so well with your speech!!! And with numbers too! You should add on your MRI costs as well. My Dad had a brain tumor and me and mom talk about adding up all of his bills since June 2016 to June 2017, but we haven't done it yet... MRIs are super expensive, especially if you get a pet scan with it when they inject you with sugars basically. It's like 20,000 for one MRI. Crazy! I will donate to your gofundme and I hope you're Dad is doing better and better! Sending love 💜💜💜💜
Oh man I hear ya! For my 35th Birthday I got diagnosed with 2 types of breast cancer.  I had 6 big chemo sessions every 3 weeks that cost 32,000.00 EACH. That is not a typo. Then I had herceptin chemo for a full year every 3 weeks.  I can't remember how much that one was. Plus the 6 surgeries I have had so far with 2 more at least to come.  Plus 4 hospitalizations and more coming with the surgeries.  My next surgery is Nov 6th.  It sucks but what choice do we have? I am glad you are doing well. Prayers for your family during this hard time and I am so sorry to hear about your dad.  : (
Your brain surgery and expenses cost more than my house did!!!  I live in Canada and we have universal health care.  I can't imagine the stress of these bills after everything you've been through... it's just not fair!
I am in AWE of the cost of your brain surgery. This video is heartbreaking. (from a Canadian's perspective).
Girl, I don't know how you keep smiling and looking fab while going through all this! You're strong, true inspiration
It's CRAZY how much medical stuff is, especially in desperate situations. I had a retinal detachment and have to have eye surgery within a week otherwise I'd be blind forever and it was over $40,000. And universal healthcare is unreasonable. 😒
You are an inspiration to many. So strong and I’m honored to see your progress. I agree with you, it’s ridiculously expensive but like you said, it’s needed.
Her eyes are so pretty! BTW you are such a strong powerful woman! You are so brave and amazing and so inspirational!
As a teacher aren't you insured??
I actually work in a calling center for billing department for hospital in North Carolina. And trust me it is EXPENSIVE!!! Insurance covers a lot but doesn’t cover everything’s. Everything is based off your deductible co pays and co insurance
If it affected ur speech it is barely noticeable
It's so sad how our medical works in America. I have a friend who is a pharmacy tech in an oncology office and she told me that chemo pills cost the hospital like $1.00 and they sell them for $3000. Like how are you doing that to sick people?!? It's so sad
your speech is getting so much better, i’m so proud of you 🌸
Why doesn't she answer any of our questions? It was ok for us to sit and listen to her and then she just dismisses us after that!
Everytime you said radation, I got so happy and proud of you. You could not correctly pronounce that  before. You are slowly and slowly getting better at your speech. All the prayers for you and your family.
I think all of us are wondering how much insurance covered....we hope alot!  Yes, medical operations and follow-up, especially for cancer is expensive, but, here you are!  Wouldn't have it any other way.  I am experienced in the high cost and what it does -- in America, it drives alot of people into bankruptcy -- like my brother.  But, he is  here, too and that's what's important.
Wtf you Gotta pay to have surgery. What kind of fucked up country is America. Oh yeah the country that loves guns and seeing there people murdered in mass shootings, God save the fucking queen.
I'm Canadian. And I am so sorry you have to pay for this. Wat
Wait so, are these out of pocket costs or covered by insurance?? Like, how do Americans actually afford these costs? Can you pay these costs in installments??
wow, your speech is amazing!! So happy your recovery has been quick and you're doing better!
Hope you have applied for Social Security Disability Income (SSDI)  for now and however long you need it. Once you are on (SSDI - they will pay you back to the date of your first application / hurry apply), when you have been on SSDI two years... you will receive a Medicare card - no matter your age. You will have Medicare and need to buy a supplemental policy as everyone does for Medicare... but, you will have good insurance then. Crazy they make you wait 2 years, but they do. You will need this to keep up with all your check ups.  You are doing great... sorry it has been so hard lately.
Removal of a brain tumour over here in Australia costs around $28,300. Which is $20, 659 USD. This is just crazy!!
Wow, that’s insane...so thankful I live in Canada
Court is making major bank ($$$$) off her illness.  Her teacher medical insurance covered most of these costs, I'm sure.  My sister is a teacher in Michigan. She also seems so chipper--didn't her father just pass away?  I would have gone in hiding for half a year after my father passed.  I saw her makeup collection video and there is something wrong with this woman.   She is lacking something for sure--something that 2,000 makeup items cannot fill.  P.S.  You wear way too much makeup and look like a clown most of the time.
Your speech was effortless in your intro. Nice emphasis on your words and not even a second thought
just buy a plane ticket and a visa to another country with social healthcare. stay for a while and get surgery done for free, well the price of plane ticket and accommodation.
if every subscriber just donated 1 dollar! this would be covered in no time!
yeah... i'd rather die
It sucks that in America you have to pay for your health to keep you alive. It's sort of ridiculous.\nYou are so strong ✨
So your insurance didn't cover a dime of your expenses? I'm very confused. I've been to speech therapy and it's a deductible. I don't get it. I really don't think the total you stated is your total out of pocket. Doesn't your insurance have an out of pocket maximum?...
I was lucky enough to work for a University and the insurance paid for everything except co-pays, which I only had to pay when I saw the doctor, not when I went for radiation and chemotherapy. I’m sorry you are going through the financial burden of having to pay for something that should be paid for by the government.
You are truly incredible and you inspire me to be a better person! I am so glad that you are recovering pretty well. You’re strength is so admirable! So much love. \nP.S. im so sorry about your dad. It’s not easy losing a parent and I can’t imagine what you’re going through with everything considering everything that has happened all at once. My mom passed away two and a half years ago and it’s still so hard for me.
Does insurance not cover that?
I love living in Canada here all of that is free! :)
This will sound awful, I realize that, but I can't help but wonder why they would want to find a cure, they make SO much money off of people being sick and people donating to cancer foundations... I hope I don't offend anyone by saying this. I will be donating to help you my dear, I'm very lucky to live in Canada and have free health care, I don't see how anyone can pay for these fees. Lots of love and luck to you! xx
Your speech is better with every video. I'm rooting for you.
I am so crazy impressed with how well you are doing with your speech!!! Go girl!!! So inspiring!!!
0$ in Germany. America needs a free health insurance, this is not fair
If every subscriber gives just $1 we can meet the goal in no time. Let's help Court!!❤️❤️
And in Canada its free (im canadian) and I dont understand why you pay for this in usa!
The prices for medical care make me sick!! It’s terrible!! We had to take a loan from our 401k to pay some of our medical debt and cash one out completely!! My sister in law just had chemo last year and it was astronomical!! My heart goes out to you I know it sucks xoxo 💜
I live in Canada and I am so thankful for our health care system. Obviously some things cost but surgery and radiation are covered here. My grandfather had a month of radiation and he has to take chemo pills (free) that without medical would cost about $70000 a year, plus many other things he needs such a injections monthly and more that are also free. When my family complains about the cost of parking at the hospital, I always remind them of how lucky we are to be able to go to the hospital, doctor etc for free. I seriously hope one day the US has the same care as us in Canada because if we did not have the care we do my grandfather would not be able to get the important medication he needs.
So happy I live in Canada 🇨🇦 the OHIP system should be universal
You are a priceless human being! I could see your emotions, and it hurts to see you hurt!
Your speech is so amazing!!!!! 😍😍
My family only has medical debt, my brother is handicapped and since birth has had over 40 major surgeries. Unlike irresponsible spending there isn't a way to get rid of it. Ive been paralyzed for a year now and was sick for 8 years prior, the genetic testing cost alone cost 42,000 dollars and thats just ONE test that took a year for us to get. You're cancerous tumor is just under a year of medical, you have no idea what storm could come afterwards. My brother had his brain opened on the WRONG side due to negligence and we still owed them, and more. A few years later they realized they gave him meningitis in the brain and then had to fix that along with his shunt being pulled to hard during the surgery causing his intestines to be pulled off the wall causing him to have major difficulty using the bathroom. That was again only 1 surgery with months of being in and out of the hospital at 14-18.. People are all worried about getting the newest car and phone but not worried about how much people that are sick are being treated, they milk us dry and don't have to regret it.
Being a Canadian makes me so grateful when it comes to public health care as all of this is covered. Yes we pay more taxes than Americans but it’s 100% worth it for surgeries, hospital visits, doctors visits and being able to walk out of those institutions with absolutely no bills at all. I hope with the aid of YouTube it helps to pay for this debt you have accumulated at such a young age. Praying for your speedy recovery, and by watching this I already see a large improvement in your well being. Take care young lady, you are so loved and respected.

I donated $10 I know it's not much, but I hope people have the heart to donate too, thoughts are with you and your family :)
Just donated! Stay strong xoxoxoxo
She's really milking this brain surgery topic
stop complaining about the cost you sick fucks, the government cant do everything, it takes a while to be a brain surgeon and a lot of money and skill to actually be one, you need to go to school for over 10 years for your doctorates degree and then medical school on top of that, not to mention the cost of all the time you spent in college/medical school
Mines was 8,000 per surgery
I remember your post about the mummy's still got her tummy comment and it's actually what made me start following you. I didn't however realise that the comment had come from a NURSE!!!! That's absolutely horrifying to hear!!!!! They are the people who are supposed to reassure you and a really fragile time and the fact that she had the nerve to make such a shitty comment it appalling 😡
Would love you to do a video about PCOS and how you overcame it x
And you've done it again! Touched me with your honesty as if you were the little angel on my left shoulder that is telling me that everything is alright! THANK YOU GI! 😇
I never had an issue with my body was happy with it, felt I looked good, always dressed nice then my friend wanted to join WW to be bridesmaid to my wedding but was scared to go alone so I went with her for moral support. Now 3 years on I’ve lost 2 stone and weight myself daily, feel guilty for anything nice that passes my lips and hate my stomach so much it’s ridiculous. I needed to hear your little chat tonight to have a think back to my size 12/14 self who never even owned a set of scales and enjoyed her food. Thank you G, keep being awesome xxxx 😘
I have a trick which seems to work for me when I need a boost about my body.  I'm not sure if it's a good trick or if it has downsides but as I say, it seems to work.  \nHow would I feel about myself if I was the size I am now but had just lost half a stone or a stone in weight?  I'd feel great, really confident, able to take on the world.  Even though I'm still the same size I am.  So it's all about tricking my mind that I've already lost some weight, and bringing about those feelings from previous weight losses.  Or I'm just gullible, it might be that!   \nIt's also good to remember everyone is different - there is no one perfect body shape or height or weight.  And that most people at some point feel the same way about their body, well their life really, and will be more sympathetic than you might think. xx
Totally love this. I have the PCOS too. The stretch marks are hormonal and related to the PCOS, even though you were so young.  I agree that you need to accept and give your body love and what it needs. I agree also that the fasting makes this body type feel wonderful. I fast two days every week, just eating 700 calories, and lose a little weight sometimes, but mostly, I feel great. Keep it up you are so cool.
Hi Gi! i'm not a mummy but i definitely understand the feeling of being or thinking i was the chubby kid  and feeling like skinny was in, i'm still in my 20's and i'm still working through my self-esteem and body image . I love your honesty and think you are absolutely gorgeous inside and out ! Thank you for being so inspiring <3 <3 <3
I've just been talking about the same thing lately! I used to be so hard on myself, and really nitpick, because I wanted to look perfect. There was a point where I looked just how I wanted to. Since having a baby, my body has changed a lot, you could say haha, but I'm okay with how I look, because it's who I am, and I have a great baby now.
Thank you, thank you, thank you x
I've always been the larger one too.. probably a comfortable size 12, which I would kill to be now. \nI have had a baby, and I didn't quite realise how much my body would change! Since having my little girl, I have lost all my baby weight, and then some, but I feel fatter than I was. My stomach now sags with loose skin, as do my arms and thighs. I can probably cope with it, but it is defiantly an eye opener, as I was stupidly thought that my stomach would go back to roughly what it was. \nNow seeing my body, I am just the same as you, I wish I wouldn't have felt so awkward about myself back when I was a size 12, I looked amazing. \nHowever, I wouldn't take it back. The experiences I've had outweigh a smaller body. I feel like I'm the luckiest person ever. I have a wonderful husband and 16 month old daughter. Xxx
I had the same experience when I first got stretch marks! Except I was horrified because I thought they were scars and they’d just appeared overnight and I didn’t know what they were... and I never actually thought to ask anyone and just ended up working it out as puberty came and my hips and boobs got them too
It is amazing how a throwaway comment can affect our thoughts. I am 7 months pregnant and I recently was standing in a queue and a Spanish couple in front said (in Spanish) let the fatty go in front. I speak Spanish so was completely shocked and didn't say anything to them. It really hurt me for a while and I am now kicking myself I didn't say something.x
Appreciate the honesty so much. I’m 16 and I know I compare myself to my friends and the supermodels I see everywhere I go so I’m very grateful to hear your story and hopefully take something from it ❤️
You have just completely voiced every thought I've ever had about PCOS and trying to get pregnant. Thank you for being so honest, you're an inspiration Gi xx
Honestly Gi, you are such an inspiration to me! I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 17 (now 20) and I have struggled majorly with my body confidence. Over the past few months I have discovered a lot more about how to manage my symptoms and have started to lose weight just through having changed a few things in my diet and being more conscious of what I'm putting into my body - it is crazy! Just like you I go through days where I get a little angry at my body but then I have days where I look at myself in the mirror and think 'wow, i do look good!' I just want to thank you for being so open about your experiences and about your body! I always love watching your little snip bits of PMAC training - I occasionally steal a few exercise ideas from your routines! Thank you for being you! <3
I had twins last year and it astonishes me the number of people who almost congratulate me for looking like I never even had a baby, let alone two.  Obviously it is meant as a compliment but it DID happen and it worries me how we live in this society that wants women to look untouched by the amazing things their bodies can do.
I'm at the heaviest I've ever been, being 200lbs. I don't feel like myself at all. I look at my face and it's plumper than I'm used to. I've gotten to size 14 pants and that's the end of normal sizes. I have to buy shirts in L and dresses in XL. I hate it. I can only wear certain styles of clothes because I don't want to bring notice to any of the rolls. And yet I'm scared of exercising because I'm scared of being nauseous. The weight has even given me acid reflux. My doctor told me that even 10 lbs down would most likely solve my problems. My BMI tells me I'm legitimately obese, but if you look at me I look pretty damn normal. Before anyone says BMI is flawed and I shouldn't use it, I should say yes it is flawed. However, BMI is still pretty good at telling the average person who's not an extreme athlete or body builder which weight range they're in. It's great for determining at risk populations of average people. Anyhow, what bothers me is that I don't look like what you think of when you think of obesity. So having the title of obese put on me feels really out of place. I've been trying to focus more on my food. Eating more whole foods and less processed stuff. Drinking more water and tea. Making sure I eat my meals and that they're well portioned and limiting my snacks to 2 healthy snacks between meals. Especially avoiding eating past 7pm. Hopefully I can change these things gradually because I'd really like to feel like myself again and express myself the way I used to.
lol wth is this and why's it trending
How do I encourage my fiance who doesn't like his body or feel confident with his appearance? I've got plenty of support and advice for my sisters... but what can I do for him???
Honesty like this really encourages me and gives me perspective <3 Love this!
You are such an inspiration. I'm now 16 and have struggled with how I've looked since around age 8 and it's getting worse. I've always punished myself for how I look but it's now horrible looking back at photos when I was 12/13 and I was actually so thin from avoiding food yet I know I was still positive I was overweight but now at 16 I've changed again and I hate it, I hate everything about me and I'm struggling so much with it, I'm leaving for an amazing trip in a few weeks to Iceland with my school yet my anxiety is out of control because all I can think about is that on the last day we are going swimming, I haven't stopped thinking about that for over a year and I desperately no longer want to go just because of how I'm going to look. I just wish I looked like somebody else
Thank you Gi for honestly and openly sharing with the world all the time. I feel like I could hug you today watching this. I'm same age as you and only the other day looked at young 20 something me and thought omg remember when your skin was that clear and young and fresh and you could do anything. Age is experience but youth is amazing too only when it has been lived through.
As long as I can remember iv been really self conscious of my body. All the way through high school all my friends were tiny and I always felt the odd one out, and I even had comments thrown at me in the school corridor about my size. I'm now 21 and still hate the body I'm in, and seem unable to loose weight yet at the same time have no motivation or energy to work out and push myself to loose it. I eat healthily but still allow the odd treat. I'd never dear wear anything skin tight or fitted only baggy tops and jumpers and you'd never catch me in a bikini or swimsuit in public! I can't remember the last time I stood in front of my mirror and had positive body thoughts, I tend to avoid it when I'm in just my underwear or getting dressed.
I really worry about children these days and how much they are influenced by all of the things they have access to now. BUT having said that, seeing more real life, normal people on YouTube, will hopefully give a more balanced view of the world 🦄💙💚💛💜
I wish I had a ounce of your self appreciative confidence. I have two children and struggle daily with accepting myself. My husband hasn't seen me naked (bar childbirth and pitch black intimate moments!) since before I had my first child. I look at myself in the mirror and feel proud of birthing two children, but I also mourn how confident and happy I felt with my body before getting pregnant. I eat well, I keep fit, but I just cannot shake the lack of confidence, I don't know how. I hope one day I can, because it's soul destroying
Fab mum day gi on the whole my bod is ok but I will forever be mum belly with tiger stripes but wouldn't change it. Taken me 7 years and 2 kids to get here tho
I have never been pregnant and sadly I never will as I can't have children. But I totally relate to the feelings in this video. I am 38 and still trying to find how to be comfortable in my own skin plus size skin and cant bear to look in the mirror but i am working on it Thank you for your honesty. I love your videos. X
I look back at photos of me from about the age of 15 onwards, I was so slim and attractive but I felt like a great, big elephant. One thing that I wish I could do, is go back and tell the young me to be proud of her body and to accept that she is gorgeous. All my life I have avoided wearing dresses and skirts because I have 'rugby player's legs' but I'm 45 now and have realised that they are the only pair of legs that I'm going to get so now have a wardrobe full of lovely dresses and skirts that I wear. If people don't like my legs, they don't have to look!
Struggling to see why this is on trending..? no critique of the vid just numbers.
Oh Gi! ❤️ I'm pregnant with twin girls due any day now. I've always been large ever since I gained weight when I was 15 y.o. (26 now) and my mum and my sis has always been nagging me to lose weight and be that thin again. Now with my pregnancy I've lost a lot of weight due to morning sickness and they've been on me to start weight watchers as soon as my girls are born - just so that I can keep that weight and drop further. It makes me so mad and sad. 😔😡
My highest weight was 285lbs and my main goal was to get under 200 and I did! It took about 3 years and I got down to 193! My final goal was (still is) 160 but I found out I was pregnant when I was at 193. I am now 36 weeks pregnant and I must say, going above 200 again was really hard and it made me sad. My husband has been amazing and keeps telling me how beautiful I am and I know it'll be worth it because I'm gonna have a beautiful baby girl. My body will never be the same and I accept that. I mean, I'm growing a tiny human inside of me! Isn't it amazing?! You are an inspiration for so many people Gi. We all love you <3
You are bloody amazing ❤️
I too felt empowered throughout pregnancy and I now feel proud of those stretch marks post pregnancy! I was worried about what my body would look like after giving birth but I've never been this happy about my body. I view my stretch marks as a reminder of how empowered I felt during pregnancy and hope to never feel bad about my body again!
so honest and so truthful for so many people including myself. i'm not a mum but i love these videos!
Probably late to the discussion, but I am currently 20 and i started noticing stretch marks when i was around 15/16. They'd probably developed long before that, but that was the first time I'd properly paid attention to them. At the time, it didn't bother me, they were only on the inside of the thighs, who would see them? Around a year ago, they started getting really dark, like a dark purple kinda colour  (they used to be silver), and there were a lot more on my thighs, but also on my sides. I've always been really self conscious about my weight and I dress to hide it a lot of the time. You're videos and your book and just you in general are really helping me to be okay with my 'tiger stripes' and to know that you dont have to look like everyone else to be happy with who you are. You're so confident and honest and real and its a very nice and much needed break from all the perfect models on Instagram and on magazines❤xx
I thought we only got stretchmarks when pregnant and was horrified when I got the same thigh marks and more on my boobs in my childhood. I was so ashamed of them I wouldn't go the the beach or swim with my friends anymore. I'm still not confident having my legs out. Thank you for talking about this! <3
I'm much more confident with the way I look now compared to when I was a teen/early 20s. I was so unhealthily skinny (could see my ribs) and I hated the way I looked in comparison to more curvaceous friends! I've got more to me now and I'm much happier!
This was what I needed to hear today. Thank you for encouraging me. It was actually a few weeks ago I realized I was comparing my body to my 18 year old body. The one that didn't have the health issues I have now. My goal is to be healthy now. Whether that means I'm fat or not. Being healthy is key. <3
So happy you posted this today. I suffer with body dysmorphia and in my teens i hated my body. I was a size 8 and hated it. Everyone said i looked great and i couldn't see it. I sufffered with pcos and endometriosis along with other issues so i was hairy and my stomach would swell. I had my oldest at 19 and struggled with the weight gain to the point i was nearly hospitalised. But once she was born my worries seemed to get put in a box, it was like someone flicked a switch and i was happier with how i looked. Now im pregnant with baby no.4 and embracing the bump and womanly curves. I love my saggy pouch from my 2 cesareans and my scars from various needles and ops. I know that my body has made some amazing munchkins who tell me everyday how beautiful i am 💕
I seriously have a love hate relationship with my body. Some days I love it and think “you like great, you have had 2 kids - awesome!!” Then the next I see a large stomach and bits that wobble and stretch marks and it’s repulsive. I think us as women will never love ourselves completely because of media we see and these “celebs” who snap back and just have that “skinny gene” but we should be bloody proud of it...  (by the way massive fans of you and your family!) - Essex Mum too!
All women are beautiful
This is so inspirational !! ❤️
I have never been skinny and I hate the term fat - I prefer to call myself a plus size lady! I was bullied for my weight which didn't help - I comfort ate cause I thought it made me feel good. However I'm 24, still plus size but I am happy and healthy. I was always told you will never have a boyfriend if you are fat - but I was in a 2 year relationship with a guy who adored me and we would still be together but he unfortunately passed away. However, there is light at the end of the tunnel - I've been told by guys I'm there type - and I have a date on Wednesday! I will lose weight for me and not anyone else! Anyways who'd want to fit in - I prefer being unique xxx
Last year I wore with myself about my body image and how I felt which led to me writing on a friend’s blog about my hang ups and wobbly bits. The amount of people that wanted to talk to me and say “I feel the same way too” was incredible. Don’t worry! Everyone has bits they don’t like!!\n\n(P.s here’s the link to my post: http://www.verbalremedy.co.uk/no-interest-fat-friend/ )
couldn't agree more with everything you said. didn't feel great about my body early on in puberty (probably cause I was quite skinny as a child but developed early) but I've got used to it and yeah I do have moments where I wish I had a completely flat stomach but hey ho that's life 😊😊😊
Gi you are such an inspiration, thank you for talking so openly about subjects like this, and making everyone feel accepted and appreciate the fact that we are who we are. Xx
My story is similar to yours. I was never super confident in my body. High school was a mess for me, but I got past it. I then, after accepting my body for the most part was in an abusive relationship where the guy was so worried about me getting fat that he did extreme things to me to make me diet, excersize, etc. \nGot out of that after way to long and claimed ownership over my body again. Never again would a man dictate me like that.  \nI found a wonderful man who said he could care less what I weigh, and we married.\nI felt good about myself, not the skinniest ive ever been, perhaps the largest, but the most loved.\nMy relationship with my body hit rock bottom when I lost 3 babies in a row. How could I call myself a woman?  how could my husband love me when I couldn't give him his hearts desire? I am broken, i am undeserving, i am unlovable. It was awful, i stopped taking care of myself and unfortunately dont recognise myself in the mirror my shape has changed so much but I have had 2 kids now and a third is due in about 6 weeks. My body is amazing, even if most people just look at me and think, oh she's let herself go, I know the battles I have fought to get here and the demons I face. If im able to return to a slimmer state after this baby that would be amazing, if not, my husband still loves me and I have a beautiful family.
Thanx for this video. I was always the really skinny girl, who never put weight on when i younger. I’m now 35 with 4 children ages from 4 to 18 (almost). As u can imagine I no longer have the flat stomach that I had before. Try in vain to exercise.. and feel guilty if I don’t.. \nI definitely need to except myself now, n stop looking at everyone else for how I should look. Thank you for this xx
I've never looked after my body, and have an unhealthy relationship with food. Now I'm two years into TTC and my thinking is beginning to shift. I feel guilty for being so unhealthy but, still, I feel overwhelmed at the task ahead - the task of making real changes.
I really love the honesty here. I wish I could go back and love myself and my body as a teenager - not only was I fitter and healthier than I am now but I spent so much time and energy hating myself and it's not a healthy way to be. When I had to be signed off with depression 2 years ago I spent a lot time hating myself and really turning my feelings in on myself, to the point where I delayed my recovery as I couldn't even like myself, including my body. Punishing it with excessive amounts of food or starving it were not healthy. Then I discovered running, and although it's a challenge, I like my body more now. It's strong and it can do so much more than I ever thought it could. And I think being in love has made me see myself the way he sees me, which is incredible.
Thank you for sharing, Gi 💕
Ohh how i needed this today! I suffer with endometriosis, i was diagnosed at 13, now 19. The amount of hormones ive been on is quite scary, going through medically induced menopause, 3 major operations really does take its toll on your body! Thank you Gi for making me realise that despite the fact my body lets me down I should still love and embrace it💛💛 thank you!
Love this! Thank you so much! Have had a lot of 'meh' days since the birth of my second boy a year ago (still can't lose the last of the weight!) But it's so true, my body gave me my 2 boys and am so grateful!
Love you even more this video is so special
Thank you for this video Gi, I know you won't read this but I have to say. Been to drs to see my diabetic nurse and i felt like crap. I'm never going to be a mum I've embraced this now.  \nThank you for being you xxx
What a great message, Gi!  I've always struggled with weight and have never been satisfied with my body.  I developed at a young age and have never liked my big boobs.  I found gaining a little weight helped camouflage them.  After my first son, I was so large that I went to weight watchers to help lose the extra weight and felt so much better.  I weighed less at 9 months pregnant with my younger son.  Over the years I've lost and gained back the same weight that I no longer worry about it (well, as much anyway!).  At this stage of my life, I just want to be heart healthy and able to get around easily.  It's sad how society and ads makes you feel like you're inadequate.  I'm just shy of 5 feet and my natural body type is definitely not like a stick thin model.  You're so right that we should accept and embrace who we are and not compare ourselves to others.
I never liked my figure, but am currently pregnant with my third baby and am suffering with hyperemesis. I have lost nearly 2 stone in weight in the space of a couple of months and am the skinniest i have ever been. I feel awful! I look awful and i will never ever strive to be thin or have the 'perfect' figure again!
Lots of love Gi xxx
I was diagnosed with PCOS at 15 (I'm now 36) and have always had fluctuating weight and consequently low body confidence. Things got worse however, when I was trying to conceive and tried various treatments including clomid. 7 years later I had icsi/IVF and fortunately my daughter came along. Since having her almost 7 years ago I have really struggled to lose weight. I have always exercised regularly and really enjoy it but I can't seem to get to a size that I'm completely comfortable with. I have a trainer and he works me really hard and I feel physically fit but the appearance of my body is unbearable. I'm super proud that after all the years of feeling that my body was fighting me to get pregnant that I carried a child, but in terms of body confidence I don't have any. I avoid looking in mirrors, I don't accept compliments from my husband when he says I look nice etc and this can really upset my husband but I cannot help it. I totally relate to many of the things you say in this video and hope that one day I can reach the point where I'm confident and happy with how my body looks.
Hi Gi! My body lets me down time and time again. I have had Crohns disease since I was 11 (now 35) and multiple ops have left me scarred and with a stoma bag so body image is important to me.  I've embraced how I look because you only get one shot at life.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder! Love yourself and be loved x
I hate my body I cover up as much as I can,there is not one part I like.I've recently put on a lot of weight that I can't seem to shift,but as I was anorexic for quite some years I'm trying my best not to let that mind set take over I hope one day I will like my body but it's very hard not to feel judged by people for putting on weight or losing to much weight I hope one day that I won't be influenced by people's views on the way I look 😊
Especially post pregnancy (I have not had any children) there's this enormous pressure to force yourself to shrink yourself before you leave the hospital. I think it's important to know we are meant to be different sizes I'm not meant to be a size 2. As long as you're healthy that's the most important thing
Thanks for the video Gi. So many women feel the pressure to be skinny. Over the years I've put on weight and I'm okay with that. The media drive me insane with the articles about mums who get back into there skinny jeans weeks after birth, it's putting to much pressure on new mums. We all have different bony shapes so it should not matter weather someone is a size 8  or an 18! Your a star gi, and we need mums like you to tell the truth and speak out. You look great and your a Fab mum to.
Hi Gi this video came at a good time for me! Didn't realise I needed to hear what you said but it soothed me to know everyone is struggling in the same ways I do! I was diagnosed at 13 with pcos and have had a 21 year fight with this, I unfortunately have struggled a long time with the inability to fall pregnant and it still isn't happening and it breaks my heart every month. I've tried metformin and it didn't agree with me sadly. I still hope that I will be blessed but I am trying to make my peace with the fact it may never happen. After a big scare earlier this year of finding I had a condition that could develop into cervical cancer I've had to have a coil fitted and I hate that little piece of plastic so much, to me it spells game over for the baby dream! The body I have been given may not work how it should with all the other health problems I have but it's mine and I love it, I am the heaviest weight I have ever been but I eat well don't exercise as much as I should but I'm active and I'm listening to what it's telling me for the first time in all my 34 years with it. Thank you for being you and promoting self love ❤️ you Gi are a wonderful human xxxx
I've felt bad about my body since I was way too young. I used to be really open and a happy kid, and I loved funky clothes. One day I was wearing a crop top and an older boy said: you're way too fat to wear that. From that comment on, my self image changed so much. I always worried how I would look in certain clothes and compared myself to others in a negative way. The silly thing is that when I started a diet, lost a lot of weight and was considered 'skinny', I still felt horrible. It's not so much the weight, it's the mental scars that keep nagging. Bloody annoying!
I remember a few years ago I felt so fat and disgusting and it really got me down and I look at pictures now from that time and can't believe I ever complained about it.
Well said Gi! :)\nOne thing that annoys me though is when people moan about their bodies on social media or say that they need to go on a diet when they don't. My sister ( who's only one year younger than me, 23) does it a lot and it really worries me. I recommended Megan Jayne Crabbe's book on body positivity to her as it really helped me but she just laughed and threw it back in my face :(
THANK U FOR THIS
I'm on a diet with my husband right now.. I say diet but actually we starting eating healthier and loosing weight. It is so much easier when we do it together! I lost 6 kilos but still not happy. I think I'll never be happy with my body cause I keep comparing myself to others and think that I'm not thin enough. You are an inspiration to us all! love your videos xxxx
I am currently 35 weeks pregnant and am sick off people saying woo your huge or well so and sos bump is much bigger than your I feel like I should smile but really I want to say who cares my body is grown my baby keeping him safe I absolutely adore you G!
Oh Gi. Thank you for sharing this!\nEverything you said is actually what/how i feel about my body!\nAfter having two miscarriages and having tree boy's xx\nSo happy your back
Aw Gi I love this you're being so honest! Most of us can relate to this, you are beautiful! We all are! :)
Solidarity with your post-birth confidence smack down from a nurse. Nurses, I don't think, realise the impact a throwaway comment can make on vulnerable new moms #bluestriggers
Thank you Gi. Just.. thank you. ❤️ from a mum of two from Finland
Hi Gi, thank you for this video it really helps too hear someone talking about PCOS, as not much is out there.
Had my daughter at 18, breast fed and had awesome boobs until 6 months after she was born and she moved off breast milk. I LOVED them so much (itty bitty titty committee for life) I'd been morbidly underweight all my life (due to high metabolism) until I hit 30, then the middle aged spread I'd been begging for started. I can now wear adult sized clothes and don't have to have Justin Bieber or Barbie emblazoned across the bum of my tracksuit pants. I love my hips and curves. If someone says anything, especially if they've known me since my stick bug thin days, I just say I had to work hard to get this big. I'm not going to work even harder to try and get rid of the extras to please anyone else. I'm the voice in my head in the moments of silence. As long as I am content with myself it is nobody else's business.
A wonderful message! I also love the message from The Body Image Movement via the movie 'embrace'- go find it! It's wonderful! 'Your Body is not an ornament, it's the vehicle to Your dreams' !!
Needed this today, such a great video x Thanks for sharing
I always say I wish I was as fat as the first time I thought I was fat! When you are younger you never actually appreciate what you have.\nYears and years later and a couple of dress sizes bigger I actually feel more comfortable and happy now than I ever did ! \n\nFab vlog as usual gi 😘 xx
Wow such a strong video to watch you're a beautiful person to speak to us about your personal experiences.xx😀💗
Thank you for sharing this Gi ❤️ since having my little boy (he's two now) I've really struggled with my body - confidence has been at all time lows more than it has been positives! Although it's taken me this long, I'm finally embracing my body and self care is so important. Not every day do I feel like that, and inspiring people like you make me realise that it's ok to feel like that. So thank you 😘😘 Katy xxx
So weird! I decided to go for a run today, first one since having my baby so that's 9 months of pregnancy + her 18months! Didn't manage very far but felt so good afterwards, it's time to start taking care of my body for my sake and for my daughter! Thanks for the boost Gi! x
I've been really up and down with how I've  felt about my body.  I have always been on the heavier side, ever since I was a kid.  When I got to college I really let my eating get out of control and I got to be really heavy and unhealthy.  But then last year I began exercising regularly and eating better than I had in my entire life!  I felt great and thought I could accomplish anything!  I lost a good amount of weight, but still hadn't reached my goal. Recently, however, I've felt that my impulse control has gone and I've gained back some of the weight that I had lost and I've started eating junk again, and I don't know if I'll be able to be as healthy as I was before.  Hopefully I can get resume the healthier habits that I had before, and I can be happy and healthy again.
Awesome video.  Thank you for always being so honest.
I was having a meh day too. This video has made me feel so much better ❤
It’s so nice to hear you talk about pcos. I found out 6/7 years ago that I had it at the same time of trying for our first child. After over a year of trying I finally had our first son and couple of years later our second son. They are truly my little miracles. Since having them my body and pcos has really become a massive struggle. I get so angry with it but it’s made me the person I am today and I’m stronger for it.
You are amazing, Gi!
Loved this! One of my personal struggles is staying motivated to eat healthy and staying active? \n\nSide note, your car gives no shits about sitting on the dining table 😂
Beauty lies within
Bloody love this woman!
Really important video
Yes Gi!! :) xx
Hi Gi would you ever do a video about PCOS? Things such as how it effects you and what medications you take to help with your symptoms? Not just conception and pregnancy (that too obviously) but your journey with PCOS in general like the excess hair, spots, weight gain, mood swings etc, and what things help with each? I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 18 (I'm now 30) and am always on the look out for other ways to cope.
After suffering from anorexia for years and years I really appreciate super honest videos and posts like this my love!! Well done you, it why we all love ya! ❤️
I have two sisters and grew up being the chubby, short one. My lovely nickname was Fatty Arbuckle! it was meant to be endearing???? My body confidence came when I had my first little lady. Of course, I have a few bad moments on occasion, but there's something kind of magical about having children, being in a team with your body and seeing how amazing it is, rather than being at war with it. Thank you for sharing your stories. xxx
I've lost 13st over the last 18 months and I feel wonderful, ok I'm not going to be toned but I'm so happy 😊 😊 😊 😊 great video xxx
Wow. This was so honest and real. I've never related to something as much as I relate to this video and your story. Actually, I've never been pregnant and I always worried about how my body would be after I had kids... Thank you for this message and for sharing your story. Xx
Gi - I found out I had PCOS when I was 16 getting my first birth control and I was so crushed for awhile. I'm 19 now and I still worry about it sometimes. Thank you for opening up about this, it means so much. <3 x
What you said at the end about not swapping your size 8/10 body for Buzz and Buddy really struck me! I'm 12 weeks pregnant and really fluctuate between feeling great and proud of my changing body but then last night a pair of my pjs were too tight around my tummy and it just crushed me because I don't really have a proper bump yet. I had this big hormonal discussion with my husband while he tried to convince me that what my body does is amazing and that he loves the way I look as I'm changing but I just felt really sorry for myself that I was going to lose my 8/10 figure that I've only had for a few years but you're right I want this baby more than anything and that's just going to have to include my figure - so thank you very much! A well timed video for me haha
I recently just saw a photo of me at 20 years old, and when I used to see it, I would wish I were that skinny again. But then I remember how that was one of the most stressful years of my life. And some people, when stressed, gain weight. Not me. I STARVE. I literally forget to eat, and I was going to nearly four days without sleep and only coffee for nourishment. Now I look at that photo and think that I never want to be that unhealthy or that weak.\n\nI'm much bigger and heavier than I was then, but I'm also far stronger (I started doing aerial arts a few years ago; it's been incredible). Though I still have days where I really notice my soft tummy, or my thunder thighs, and just not contented with how I look.\n\nIt hasn't helped that in Filipino culture, we have this awful kind of tradition of greeting each other with Uy tumaba ka! (Hey, you've gotten fat!), especially during family reunions by overly nosy aunts. They use a tone that's supposed to be well-meaning, but actually just feels really degrading. And it does things to your confidence. Even when I was dancing ballet, and wasn't at all overweight, but I get a little heavy, and suddenly people react as if I've grown so much.
Watch the behind the scenes by clicking on me :) Stoked to have worked with WB Games on this project. And thank you to our amazing audience for supporting and believing in us! We would love to do more projects like this, and you all make it possible! - Devin
I. Want. An. Ending.\n\nThat was awesome, haha. 👏
I SO wasn't ready for this one to be over. This could have been a 10+ minute video with 100% watch time. Clever video guys!
Nice video\nCan you make assasinscreed origins parkour in real life?\nKeep up the good work
Geez Devin, never knew you were such a jerk.

ORC 2020
ORC:это фиаско, братан
Wasn't expecting that but it was awesome!  Action and Cinematics combined with a bit of humor.  Love it!
That orc looks like something out of WoW - not Middel earth
Wasn't expecting THAT or the video to basically end with a blatant ad for the game. Was kinda suspecting Talion to be security
That was sooooo creative and the editing was awesome!! Great work Team Supertramp!
That orc is hilarious ruining the shot everytime
I'm surprised their heads aren't on a Spike already after that
Make some more middle earth videos

This was incredible! Keep it up TeamSuperTramp 👍
I feel there was a missed opportunity for a Troll joke....
Haha, I liked it! Nice to see something different! (Other videos are great too though!) Keep up the good work!
0:56 Loud Noise. Urks With Red Amour: The Sound Is Good
Where's Thrak when you need him?
Missed opportunity with using the Orc for a comedy. Could've done something pretty cool
Nice how you see the lockscreen of the iPhone with notifications on it at 0:48 :D But a great movie! Like it!
I’m going to pick this up Friday

That's so funny. Well done! :D
You would think it would memorable to bully an orc even if it was 8 years ago. Great video!!
Awesome buddy! \ncome back to the UK and lets film!! 😄
I felt sad for the orc xD
Awesome! You really created something I wouldbt expect this time with your storytelling! Awesome!
That was not what I was expecting, but I really liked it. Nice work, Devin!
Wtf did I just watch :D devin... Taking it to a whole new level
I felt sorry for the orc :(

watching this video by skipping few parts of google event
Your video amazing but always few viewer but you have 4 billion subscriber. I subscribe this channel when i watch assassins real life
Brother, I wish you achieve the success you deserve. You make really great music
I can relate so much. Both of my parents are so disconnected it just makes the rest of us feel that way too. I don't really consider them as my parents anymore but just as two more people in the house. I once wished we could fix our relationship like they did in the video but after years of mistreatment, I stopped caring. Sorry for the long comment, I'm a big fan of Jacob Banks. His songs and music videos are always on point, he deserves more recognition for the art he puts out.
guys! omg f ree amazon gift cards from here ➜ lythu.com/giftcardsgiveaway?137387163
Jacob Banks... stop. Now. There's only so much room in my playlist for a single artist. This isn't right. You're *too* good
I'm a simple guy, if i see a jacob video i like it
Why the blacks with a good voice almost are unsuccessful in the United States?
I love you my brother,  very unique voice  an original
I love this song. It speaks to the depths of my soul. And this video resonates deeply.

Hello! My name is Malik Charles and im really just tryna get support for my music! I write music about Love,pain and life..please take a listen https://youtu.be/JXZgl62f0dA
Such pure and beautiful talent❤️ I love this so much
Most fools don't care about this type of music unless there's twerking, guns, and drugs being used! Me I love it and live for it! Thank Jacob &  your Team!
What happened to the original video of the couple fighting? That was a more suited
Love this song 😩😩😩 why am I now just finding out about you!
Seems like the internet has been scrubbed of the OG video. I wonder why?
You listen to the song and you’re like “Damn this is deep!”. And then you see the video...
Liked before even the video started
how is this not a hit?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤!!!!! Omg! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤  .  THE artist in you, wow, is amazing!!

Great song and story
How have I never heard of this beautiful black man before. This was pure magic <3
I love soul music, thanks a lot 🙏🏾 ! Good and great music ! God bless you and good luck 🍀👍🏽
Great video as always dude, hoping to see you in the Sugar Club in Dublin in December. Judging by your Mahogany sessions videos it's gonna be fun!!!
His songs always have such deep meanings. He puts so much emotion into every song❤
I’ll get married to him or someone similar to him I promise 🙌🏾
When you hear the same person singing the same lyrics twice thinking he put his soul on it both times, this same person comes and does this.... Masterpiece Mr Jacob Banks, Masterpiece...
Can't wait to see you in Amsterdam!
I already really loved the live version of this song on mahogany session a while ago but the clip makes everything even more moving! \nYou're just so good at what you do! You're a real artist ! 🙌🏻
Damn he have so much soul in his Voice
GREAT SONG!!! AMAZING AS ALWAYS...
My go to as I log into YouTube

Just beautiful 👏🏾🙌🏾🔥😍😘
Awesome voice
Heartwrenching
Giving him all the recognition I can. Showing his talent to radio stations here in my home country of South Africa. Really great music.
That was beautiful...
Whoa, that voice! I am digging this, instant sub!
A music video that addresses how men deal with grief and loss as well as unresolved anger and resentment is integral to sincere dialogue.  Will he be doing an interview to discuss this?

@Binging with Babish My brother, Michael Chapa, has been a fan of yours for a long time. In fact he is also the one who introduced me to your channel. I would like to buy him a signed book.... is there any way I can get this? Please and thanks!\n\nAlso can people thumb up so he might see this comment?
Wow damn dude this is a great idea/book. \nLove the cover art!!!!
http://huredrhjto.bid/8711966267852/
I AM SO READY TO BUY THIS BOOK \nHopefully there's an audiobook too cuz I could listen to your monotone voice for hours
I watched you blow up from 70k to over 1.5m and now having your cook book
I just got it aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa yay QUQ I can't wait for it to arrive
Yeah, my pre order got delayed too...ordered it back in aug...sux...but I still want so I wait
Got an email from Amazon today saying that my pre-order has been delayed. No shipping date currently available. :(
Amazon told me it was delayed... I pre-ordered this like a week after he first announced it. Why has it been delayed if it hit bookshelves?
Any word on what's going on with the Amazon delay?  Preordered the day it went live, and Amazon has NO idea when it's gonna ship.
*On Sale* DZ90 Smartwatch\nhttp://www.ebay.com/itm/272872707002
Already PRE ORDERED
Congrats *^*
Just bought your book. \nIt's out of stock.  Do you know when I'll be getting it?
wait, does it mean anyone who pre-order the book can have the signature or have the chance to win the signature?
He's out of stock!!! Nooooooo
tbh for the pre orders u should stick the books in the envelopes and the signed one mix them up and lable them so you send them out with no clue to who the winner is XD
When to get book realized it was already out of stock
Preordered it a while back, can't wait to get it! Congrats!
Im super excited, preordered this for my dad almost 2 months ago. Cant wait for it man, loved basically every dish youve made on here
Do ship to Australia
Preordered it a few weeks ago, and now I’m seeing ‘sold out’ on Amazon, with no estimated ship date. Looks like demand surpassed supply by a long shot.
#11 trending!
There better be ratoutouolle
I already saw this yesterday at the Tennement Museum's gift shop in NYC!! So exciting
Just saw the video so I missed pre-order by one day...
Will you ever make a Russian dish, if so can you call the episode binging with babushka\nBabushka means grandma in Russian
It is weird to watch this when you struggle with binge eating disorder...
I wanna get that if it is available to Australia
I'm exited for the book, but will it have a metric system version coming out ? i don't want to have to do all the conversions myself
Morning Joe nails the dark fantasy fueling gun nuts: They buy military weapons ‘to kill American soldiers’\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQy9jBMoL-Q
Soooooooo got an email today saying that the delivery of the cookbook had to be pushed?  Is there any say when they new delivery date will be? Just wondering.  Looking forward to receiving my copy!!!!!! 🙌🏽🙌🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽
Really disappointed that I pre-ordered months ago and am now being told I won't even get it until November if not later. Rather poorly handled book launch.
Amazon is now saying my preorder from August won’t ship until November 😭😭 This was supposed to be my birthday present to myself!
Sold out on Amazon! Congrats, Andrew!!!

I need to interview this man and ask him what makes him get such brilliant writing.\n\nAndrew, your passion for alliteration is often keeping me coming back to this fabulous channel.\n\nThat, and the food.\n\nI Youtube for a really niche group, Trading Card Games, and even then, I wish to emulate and learn from you as a content creator.\n\n\nYou got the stuff. Idunno what it is. but you got it.\n\nThat being said, Hope your book sells and goes Triple Truffle or whatever cooking books do when they sell out in the millions.\n\nI know what I'm begging friends to get me for Christmas...
Props man! Love your channel!
Dude, it's sold out
Mine!!! Pre ordered a while ago! Cant wait :))))) YER A BADASS BABISH
Yayayay it's out today!!!

I bought your book last month for my b-day. (it was even on sale for $15) ^^ Looking forward to it!
Congrats
You should try and make Monster Cake from Breath of the Wild! I'd love to see how you'd go about making your own 'Monster Extract' for the recipe!\n\nEdit: Seems you've already done this! Good show!

Do you ship to New Zealand and do I still get a personalised copy if I don’t pre-order?

I ordered it back in August but Amazon seems to have failed me on delivering it in time. RIP
#11 ON TRENDING WOOOOHOOOO
I watched you when you had barely any views on videos...and now you have an amazing cookbook coming out 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 great work man, keep it up!!
If you know it's going to be dropped why don't you pick it up before it falls to the floor?
Go to google and type: WUMO SEO. Its the most excellent Search engine optimization company in the world. If they can not rank your websites, they will offer you100% money back guarantee. They're the incredibly best.
I have the best cook book ever. It's called the internet. I can learn to make anything. So I will save my money and instead of buying some dumb cookbook I'm gonna buy some groceries.
I'm pretty disappointed, dude, I know this is popular but I pre-ordered this through your Amazon link on August 24th in Canada. Today I'm informed they are out of stock and it'll be delayed. It's a surprise gift for my girlfriend who introduced me to your wonderful channel. It's not your fault, I know, but pretty frustrated at a system that sells you a pre-order and they don't tell you it's not available until the night of expected delivery.
Can't wait to torrent this.
What's sad is that people are saying the Attack didn't happen and it's a hoax by the Government.
Shooter was a left winger antifa fuck going after conservative whites
My heart goes out to all that at are dead/injured stay safe and fuck these people that do this #prayforvegas
A bump stock is not necessary to make a semi-automatic AR-15 or AK-47 fire as a full automatic.  By pushing forward on the handguard while holding the rifle loosely and keeping your finger on the trigger without using the grip when the rifle recoils while being pushed forward it will bump the trigger finger repeatedly and keep firing. It mimics a bump stock.  It's a waist of ammunition that has no sporting purpose.
This is America, people ask for so much freedom, free This free That, and the government even worry about another country never have enough human right, American now have so much human right, the right to Kill the right to express yourself, this is the true freedom of America, where average citizen has no right to enjoy their life.
God bless this world this man is disgusting I know many people who were there I know few that died and I am heartbroken someone would do this it's disgusting #weareallone
Two days ago I posted cruel and disparaging comments ( that I've since deleted)  about this incident that I now regret.. what swayed my change of heart..    is that today,  i saw a collage of all the victims murdered by this maniac...all the young people who lost their lives.... at least 30 of the  victims were in their 20s ...absolutely heartbreaking... this shit most certainly was not funny.. and God help me ...I never should have made lite of it ....  I am so so sorry ... now what I would like to say  instead of the crew evil shit  I said previously.....is  that my heart goes out to all the families who lost someone in this tragedy and \n I don't care what race they  are/were...\n this was some fucked up shit..and  the  differences that we all have with each other are  irrelevant right now... As  for me this puts everything in perspective. ....Black versus white... Republican vs Democrat... kneelers versus non kneelers \n.its all bullshit....lives were lost ..innocent young promising lives.... who gives uh fuck who the President is... \n  If he or she can't even keep us safe in our own country whats the point and no I'm not blaming Donald' Trump or anyone for this.... nobody could have prevented this, just like those hurricanes.... now I'm not going to be phony and say we should all love one another... because despite this \ntragedy.  that's probably not going to happen... but what I will say to everybody is please be safe.... no matter what... we're all Americans.. and I for one don't want to see anybody hurt, and I definitely don't want to see anybody die.... God bless \n Love America... and all its citizens
There are now 59 confirmed dead, over 500 wounded, many are in critical condition.
People ask your self this question. Why would a man of this statue do something like this? Doesn't make any sense !!! Just like his brother is mystified just like I am
No one screams from being hit? No blood? No pictures or videos of people shot? 22k people w/cell phones?
Is beautifull, so many Rich and happy fmilly Ruin their live.
False flag operation
Everyone who makes it about race; you're justifying every time some criminal who is black shoots up a home in a drive by, someone else making it a racial issue rather than a criminal one.
*If you watch carefully a video posted by someone on YouTube, you can see what appear to be muzzle flashes coming from the second floor as well:* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihkw_VFDzxo&t=0s
So trump can go to las Vegas but not to MX or PR Wtf dude PR is in a critical condition rn
My heart goes out to victims and families! RIP! This is disgraceful! All hotels need X-RAY software even hidden to sound silent alarms when someone walks inside with all these rifles. This can happen again if they dont prevent this using X-RAY silent mode software and agents.
Every country has got nut jobs. That's nothing special, it's all about access. When someone looses it in America they're able to purchase military grade weapons and kill 60 people. Who it is of what decent or religion is the narrative people apply after the tragedy has happened. So when people say they're glad the shooter was white instead of something else shows how far we are down the rabbit hole.
doesnt shelter in hotels seem like the wrong idea?
Guy made up almost half of Chicago gang shooting stats in 45 minutes.
What what in the butt butt
you can't get anyone to understand anything...\nand i think,\n.\nthat is the point.
Just another crazy crakkker doing what crazy crakkkers do...shooting their own kind PLUS killing kids at schools.
CIA false flag to take away guns ........ oh and go to hell trolls.
Since he was white everything is fishy and conspiracy but if a person of color he is a terrorist good job America
Here's a tip, Stop going to events.
You guys will blame Muslims for it soon .
People mowed down by a leftist while chanting “god bless America”. Seems like liberals got an early Christmas present.
Who takes the professional pictures of these people and why?
I'm betting right now that there will be a movie made about this, and it will star Mark Wahlberg
There no gun fire in China. only use knife to kill . more bloody…  Sorry about las Vegas . Horrible
I was at las vegas 3 weeks ago.
a Casino.. of Gambeling.. in USA 20 Trillion Dollar Debt.. bothersome
Politics is social. Change has to be individual. Politics don't really exist except that fools buy into it. Like putting a game in front of people you know will fight over it. \n\nGreetings everyone! I'm trying to start a music video channel here on YouTube but it's difficult to get seen. \n\nThe music is instrumental and may fall under categories ranging from mellow to rock to hip hop - but mostly a unique combination of them all.

To liberals down is up and if you follow that belief system to its logical end you end up in hell.
Neighbor of 8 months said Paddock was a Trump supporter but also believes it's a setup since Paddock was a really nice guy and couldn't believe he'd turn out to be a monster.
Fake fake fake, false flag you guys need to do a better job!!
That's a meme just need the school shooting theme and we good.
Congress responsible for these murders allowing guns to public.
They don't call Los Vegas Sin City for nothing..
False flag attack for the 500th time
Rest in peace all
Prayers to all of the people that have lost family🙏
shooter was with  Radical Antifa Group, look it up , dont believe anything on the bbc
VERY GOOD NEWS..!! THIS IS A PAYBACK TIME FOR BRAINLESS AMERICANS , REVENGE FOR KILLING INNOCENT CIVILIANS IN SYRIA, UKRAINA, YUOGOSLAVIA, LIBYA, AFGHANISTAN, IRAQ, ETC.... GOOD AMERICAN IS A DEAD ONE...!!! WELL DONE..!!
Guy is just walking like,  why is everyone running and falling to the ground? 
Yet another inside job, lol that’s even faker than 9/11
Of course the propaganda arm of the continent colonizing British government would happily promote this to their disarmed citizens with no ulterior motives.
 At lest two have been killed...
Those poor ,terrified people I feel so sorry for them R.I.P those who deid at this attack R.I.P you shall be missed
Where is that photo on thumbnail? Clickbait sht
It like we not safe going no where
WHERE WAS SUPERMAN?  PROBABLY CLARK KENT WAS BANGING LOUIS WHEN THIS WAS GOING ON.
NRA supporters gunned down by an NRA supporter.  The irony.
Excuse me USA, here's Italy. It's very simple, let me explain this in the easiest way possible: no guns, no shootings. Why are you trying to avoid mass shooting with more guns? Think about it in this way: how do you put a fire out? Certainly not with more fire. Think about it USA. Let me know if you need another explanation. I'll gladly help :)
The worst country in world
If he christian, he would be called atheism and politics aim. \nIf he muslim, he would be called terrorist. \nUSA logic!
I feel so bad for why don't we they were on lockdown😭
I mean, I know country music is bad. But there's no need for this kind of behaviour.
but the mexicans are criminals? hahaha so whats that republicans?
Can Trump just not let Americans in America? They're far too dangerous.
I hope the shooter is injured and disabled in prison and dies of a brain aneurism when he is let out so he finally sees the light of freedom once again only to have it ripped away
White on White crime is insane in the USA. White terrorism. God bless the victims.
ay yall i was working on the strip right across the street during this shit was WILD
Smells like a false flag.
I mean freind
Fooking pussies
What about porter ico??
I hear firecrackers
*Prayers arent needed...MONEY IS!*
country music
Wherever there is ISIS iran is iran, Wherever iran is
*STOP THE PSYOPS*
#rip for Vegas ppl
omg
Praying for you
Man Delay Bay.. Los Vehazzz
Dumb country hicks getting killed. Good haha.
What happens in vegas stays in vegas
Sub to willne
Can someone please explain why there is absolutely no blood or dead bodies in any YouTube video I've seen??????? I've seen people running and screaming.  I've seen people being carried by others,  but not a single sign of blood or anything. This is one strange mass shooting.
Random 64 year old white guy with no criminal background, no history of mental illness and was a friendly man got a hold of 23 rifles and randomly shot into a crowd of people. Seems very fishy, Remember not to take whatever you see on the news as the narrative, think for yourself.
HOLY SHIT, yall Americans need to be friends with russia atm yall mfs need help yall gon die without help with that shit Yall need to evacuate rn! \n\n(Edit) that wasn’t a racial comment all my peoples is my peoples love you guys but seriously yall need to do something about that
Why does this always happen on my birthday
Watch & wait! The girlfriend in the Philippines has more than a little involvement in this!
Dont think one man can injure or kill that many people in min.\nMos def tbe sound of more than one gun goin off...GOVERNMENT ORCHISTRATED!!
Alrighty, let's take a vote for something that's absolutely not debatable the will hopefully get both sides of people to agree. CRACK DOWN ON GUN SMUGGLING. The only true unbiased way to see if shooters will get their guns legally is to crack down on all illegal transactions taking place in drug dens. Making legal guns harder to get is one thing, but I think ALL OF US should be able to agree to CRACKING DOWN ON ILLEGAL WEAPONRY.
USA is such a evil country.....full of evil people.
Nobody thinks this is suspicious or a little odd doesn't add up
JUST MORE FAKE NEWS..\nNobody died,stop with your Soros funded Vigil's and paid crisis actors!
Just another day in the usa.
More like 59 dead, and 515+ injured...
Why are the authorities showing the VIDEO SURVEILLANCE footage from the Hotel hallways showing the gunman toting all the weapons into the room..?  THERE IS NO REASON they can't show that.  It has no negative effect on the investigation whatsoever.  So........BLOOD in any photos of victims........and NO HOTEL FOOTAGE of gunman carrying in weapons.\nHMMMM...........amazing.   NO EVIDENCE this guy did anything at all.  Yet they tout him as the shooter.  I'm not buying it.
I wish trump was the only one to get hit with all them run
God bless all involved in this horrific incident..but in all the videos that have shown the Hotel where the shots were coming from, I’ve  seen no muzzle flash from the machine guns which would be clearly visible at night.
Welcome to America. Guess what nothing will be done. We all going to feel sorry, pray, help but our Congress will not stop gun control. What type of amendment is for  an individual  to have a semi auto machine gun for  protection?  20 mass shooting in 2/3 years alone. NRA profit on guns is more valuable than human life's right?  Smh, Welcome to America.
This is very heart breaking for family members to witness the death of their own. When I heard that he was going to kill people during life was beautiful, I was completely shocked because one of my own was going over there. However, we have to see the bright side of things. These things happen every day, and that is how life is now. We have to take advantage of this. This is a learning experience. Stop saying things and start doing things. Also, I don't believe Isis did this. They claim every attack and it is quite annoying for Muslims because they are always the ones to be blamed and I think that we should be sorry.
Lol
white terrorism!!!!!
No noticing that witnesses reported multiple shooters?....
Fake!
I swear I'm not green-screened onto this: it's just weird lighting!
I'm guessing Fermat's Last Theorem is one such case.
Theres one of these on the River Severn at Hampton Loade, near Bridgnorth, but it hasn't run at all this year.
The obvious thing we still haven't invented is slood. It comes after fire, but before the wheel. Except we missed it.
If you kayak this is the same principle as in ferry gliding.
So how, exactly, is this different from sailing ships tacking? Still a clever idea, but I bet that if tom had experience on a sailboat this wouldn't be that innovative of an idea. Just an example of specialized knowledge.
A movie I saw as a child in the 1950's showed a scene with one of these craft being used in Florida at a time before railways, automobiles and air conditioning had made it hospitable for people from cooler climates to want to go there despite alligators and hurricanes.
Female phychology. There must be something obvious to it since it affects more than half the world population but we still haven't figured it out.
As a kayaker we do this all the time, it's even called Ferrygliding. The only difference with a kayak is that you have to keep paddling upstream.
Wow im amazed how fast flowing the rhine is compared to something like the Thames
It's an obvious idea to someone who sails sailing boats, basically it's just using the water currents rather than air currents to sail by ;)
I loved how, in addition to the usually informative video this one was also inspirational. Great job Tom. Thank you.
The 26 dislikes are from people who hate free energy. Shell I suggest any names?
Powered boats can do this too.  They can motor up against the current to match the speed of the current.  That way they can be stationary with the land and yet move sideways!  It can help manoeuvre in tight spaces (Though very few skippers seem to know how to do it, despite its simplicity and usefulness).\n\nFunnily enough, it's called ferry gliding!  And now I know why :)
Wow you are in Basel! Thats where i live xD
Maybe there is still some big, obvious-in-hindsight stuff out there that will change the world, just as soon as someone thinks of it\n\n[thumbnail for rotary jails video appears]
`Light Bulb moments `have been the reason for human dominance on this huge free floating  Molten rock
Its sailing in the water stream. Near Dresden in Rathen is a bigger feary that uses the same technice
y do you keep coming to Switzerland without telling me!!
Basel is a port city. In Switzerland. Which means that Switzerland has a merchant marine.
We used to have hundreds of these in British Columbia. I assume they probably died out here because of safety concerns. We used to have car-sized wooden suspension bridges too.
Tom, I swear to God, this is the second time you were in Switzerland and I missed you again (last one in Zurich) by probably about a week or so! Next time you post something hinting there on Twitter or elsewhere, I will move heaven and earth and whatever else to meet you. Or at least try to give you a video idea via mail and getting you where I am so I can contribute.
Wow. That is so cool. I would never have had that idea. But so obvious when you see it.
There are several reaction ferries in Canada that carry cars.
IT'S CALLED PETROL TOM >:( but these boats are rather cool
Using warmth 20 meters underground via some conducting material to prevent train switches or other critical infrastructure from freezing over. \n\nSo obvious, but I dont think its done anywhere.
That's like the guy who floats down the river to work instead of driving 😊 I love simple solutions that use natural reusable energy
Sadly, thinking about is not enough, sharing the knowledge and people with a need that search for a solution is a must\nI think this relationship is what really changed the world, but today, with the tsunami of data on the internet, very few actually study something, and the rest have all the incentive to keep secrets and patent them since their livelihood usually depends on it\nso, cutting edge knowledge is a commodity and old knowledge is buried amongst irrelevant and sometimes wrong info and as a result get overlooked
When I was at Switzerland, I was stoned by clarity of Rhine in Bern... That river is something that I can not easily understand...
It's like a kite using water instead of wind.
I there some sort of meet up? I live in Basel!
I actually live just next to such a ferry. The one I can see from my window is much bigger and can load 10 cars or so. It is really fascinating, but I just don't like it for commuting because here the ferry has no scheldue, and waiting about half an hour can be quite annoying. Glad I only enjoy it on Sunday trips or so. Great video.
i didn't understand the principle  could somebody please explain it?
There are a few of those in the Netherlands as well, I believe, although they look like normal ferries and the cables run underwater, not above it. If memory serves me. And maybe they've been disposed of already.
Omg i was on the exact spot you stood there in Basel a few weeks ago!
I am sure there is one at Symonds Yat
We have a reaction car ferry in McLure, British Columbia, that will take a few cars at a time across the North Thompson.  It can't run when there's ice on the river or during spring flooding.
ah I'm so sad. I live in Basel but I'm on vacation right. so sad to miss you :(
That is a interesting thing to think about. \nIf you live in a place where the conditions for something like this doesn't exist, you'd never think about it. You'd never think to even look it up. \nA thing you don't know you don't know.
Read about another Swiss project recently. There's a mine in the mountains, and the ore (or whatever it produces) is transported down to the valley in trucks that use the weight to produce electricity on the way down, which is more than enough to drive them up the mountain again when they're empty.
How do you get 50 fps video?
I was so shocked when I saw your video because I am from Basel
Clever Bavarians recently replaced one of theese by a gasolin driven one. The old one has sunken due to the lag of maintanence...
It kinda works like sailing, but the wind is replaced with water flow and the resistance from the water is replaced with a cable.
It's basically a kite. A water-kite, but the principle remains.
There are other surprising pre-electrical means of transportation in the Alps. For example water-balanced funiculars - such as the one in Fribourg, Switzerland. Both cars have a water tank, and the upper one gets filled up, while the bottom one is drained, whenever the cable car needs to move. The inbalance and gravity does the rest.
I live in switzerland! And it works nicely!
Someone tell me why Thoughty2 has more than double the subscribers to Tom Scott?
better than tesla's auto drive
If we can sell pizzas with tomato sauce spread over them then why not toast with butter already spread?
There is one near Mammoth Cave in Kentucky.
How do other tall boats not hit the overhead cable?  Also, I'm reading that there are floating cable reaction ferries.  Even more of an issue for boats going up or down the river.
Have you thought of doing a video about that slice of  Germany inside Switzerland?
You also need a river that you can string a wire a cross that isn't going to be snagged by tall ships. Probably wouldn't work on the Thames.
Wow tom is on trending, I'm shocked
You‘ve been to my town and haven‘t told me? To shame!
This technique is used in kayaking - it's called the 'ferry glide'.
Isn't this the same principle that yachts use to sail against the wind (tacking)?
Dude, bummer! Would've been great to meet you, since I live there.
Thank you for all the videos. Very much enjoyed and appreciated.
Oh I think there's plenty of room left in all of time to make a few more interesting ideas come to life....
COME TO LAUSANNE BABY WE HAVE SCIENCEY STUFF
You should do a video on the Theory of Inventive problem solving. A Russian engineer spent his entire life studying patents to see how humans made solutions to stuff like this. It's now generalized into a few charts, and is really quite handy.
Thats incredible! How has someone not applied this concept for electricity generation I wonder?
Ah, thank you for this Tom. =)
Interestingly a very similar technique in kayaking and canoeing is called ferry gliding.  Forward paddling and or momentum are substituted for the wire
I hope they got a license from the Fine Bros.
Wtf...I was just on one of these a few hours ago. Now I'm seeing this vid. What a coincidence
Since you are in Switzerland are you going to visit CERN? It's only 2 hours by car from there :)
I just found this with AVE's last video on reducing chatter on a lathe, so obvious, but I'd never looked at the problem in that way before.
They are *floating kites* for transporting people....
Just out of interest cause I'm living there, when where you in Basel?
...and Nile boats use a combination of wind and water flow to go upriver and down...\n...and-yes my fifth-grade observation about electromagnetism overrides Maxwell's...
They have one of those in Kurort Rathen,  Saxony. It's near Dresden of you're ever in the area
It's also a technique used in kayaks and canoes to ferry across rivers and other streams. Paddle against the current and angle your vessel towards the side you want to go to. It is great fun. :)
Ohhh hey come to Geneva
Like
Lmao Adidas nmds spotted @ 1:01
Very elegant and cool!
Earthships?
Thats very clever stuff I never knew, cheers!
Haha, nice!
im sorry this is force vectors gitgud
Same as windsurf works
Excellent video Tom.
Ayyyyy I live in basel
all of Tom's videos are nicely done but, it's just me that his voice bother so much? =( it's not my fault tho.. sorry..
What a great solution!
Erection flurries
damn, this got deep
Donald Rumsfeld was right!  😂\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w5JqQLqqTc
Very prophetic Tom
That was delightful.
Yay! Welcome to Basel
Awsome
Can you explain how cell phones and cell towers communicate at high speeds? Like on the motorway? (Does some of the signal get lost behind?)
In Germany reaction ferries are called Gierseilfähren. I learned that from Die Sendung mit der Maus, an educational TV series for children.
Escalators. Unlike Elevators (Lifts, for you Brits), Escalators don't/can't have counter weights. But why couldn't Escalators have generators or massive flywheels to generate or store energy of the ones carrying people downward?  That could then be used to help drive the ones carrying people up.
Pretty sure humans have been pulling themselves across rivers using rope or wire one way or another for a few thousand years...
There is even simlper solution to this - not from user point of view but mechanical - the cable that connects boat to the main cable is in one corner of the bow and when you want to drift to the other river bank, you just mount the cable to the other corner and boat just steers itself.\nYou dont need any moving part like the steering lever.
Can't wait to have kids so I can shop for all the cute baby/toddler clothes 😊
Love a toddler haul!!
*I'm watching this like I have a child and want inspiration for children's clothing 😂*
I love baby clothes, they are so cute. I CAN'T. 😍😭
Red scarf looks great oh her
I love that you dress her in “boy” clothes :)!
When you said you only buy things for your daughter I teared up because I think of my mom. Even though I'm 22 she never buys things for herself. Omg a mothers love 😰 why am I crying in the club rn
Neeeed a 'Hana's look book' asap
Your daughter and mine are only half a year apart :)
You should work with @letclothesbeclothes  anti gender stereotyped clothing for kids xx
RIP to those who wore earphones in Dina's intro
Love the way you don't care about buying girly clothes and you dress Hana in whatever colour. So many people dress girls in pinks and boys in blue and I always have to ask WHY!? Loved the clothes anyway she's going to look cute in them. xx
It would be so awesome if Sid could do a video of him personalizing the trainers!
That was so entertaining 😂😂 loved it too much cuteness ☺️☺️
I have been saying this for years! Toddlers get all the coolest things
Beware what you put the baby in - she'll only resent you for it in 10 years' time!\n\nTwo weeks to grow in to her trainers! Lol!
Alsalamu Alakuim Allah bless and protect you and Sid . I love the babies clothes they are lovely and Dina your funny. I would love to be friends sister and meet you one day. Love your hijab and sweater so cute and yes please baby clothes for adults I would love that and baby inspired abayas and hijabs . Love you 💎💎💎💎😘😘

My toddler has that shoe and it's so cute! Love Zara kids!!!
Girls clothes are a billion times better than baby boys
The clothes are adorable, but can we focus on the real issue here? What did you do to your teeth?!
Dina why don't u do a video with youre grand mother :D we miss those vlogs
Ya you pay the same price for your jacket but your jacket has much more material because it's larger and it will last you a lot longer then hers! I hate how my kids clothes is so expensive I'm like come on their clothes takes way less fabric to make! And they will only wear it for 6 months max!
Selam Aleykum! MashAllah you are very blessed. Was wondering if you would ever consider giving Hanna's old clothes to other families who have more so a low income than the average family. Would be extremely helpful but who knows, might be far fetched.. thanks!
Omg i want that animal top!!!
Y don't u show ur daughters face
is a quid and pound the same thing?
I just wanna put it out there for cat owners :\n let your cats eat grass when they want to because it contains (Fer) which is good for their digestion but almost none of cat food that we buy has it
You are a lovely mum Dina <3
You should really start a kids clothing line Dina, I reckon it would be really fun and interesting.
My daughter is 9 months, an I have been mix matching her clothes with boys 😊 the best combination to purchase. Because not all girls clothes are nice. Especially when they are all pink. So annoying right!? 👍🏽gray choice Dina.
Lol why the video title change ? £160 ish on kids clothes? Wooowwwww NOT
My cat hates your intro. Adore you, but fucking hell it’s loud.
U took forever to do this
Nice to see a fellow brit
Omg dina you have just had the best idea for your next range! Please please do big kids clothes I'm so jealous of my daughters clothes! Ps: so glad you shop for her in the boys section too. People think I hate pink, I don't, I just think there are a lot of other colours that she can also wear. 🌈
Love your lobster sweater, which brand is it?
She just launched a new trend , toddler clothing haul
Omg that toddler clothing line is such a good idea... you really should do it dina! 😍😍
FEEDBACK: Try to look more into the lens, Dina!
U have so much money to splurge over a toddler clothing and from zara! Adopt me pls
Nice hair color
Personally I have a few pairs of Zara jeans and I recommend them for other men.
Just saw your New mom vlog were you say you made Hannah an e-mail and use it to send her mails that she can read in the future. Im just curious do you still do that? ^_^
Mama got a good taste! :)
YES!!!Would LOVE a Toddler Clothing Line by you 😃😀😁😊👟👕👚😇👶👼
How are there more clothes in this haul for hanna than I have ever owned😂

Aww how  cute. So this channel is always on trending just so the 1% of the population who happen to be muslim can feel included and not useless. sorry, i mean pathetic.
Loved this haul! ♥️♥️♥️You should go primark for Hannah! You can soooo much! Esp their shoes for kids are fab and cheap. \n\nNext is so so good for getting decent stuff esp for winter their hats and snood style matching scarves.
So to all the people that have ever wondered if Dina will force her daughter to wear hijab: she doesn't even force her to wear girl-only clothes
Nice song and words
thought the whiteboy in the beginning was that jake/logan paul dude
it's stuck in my head
Oh I'm overwhelmed dear..😇
Sarah's back at it again with the amazing song and video oml 😭😍💕 love you!!
It's amazing how you started from covering other artists songs and now others are covering your songs ☺ btw, great song!! 😁🙌
IM SO SAD THAT I DIDNT GET TO SEE HER ON TOUR
This video is so aesthetically pleasing. Love you so much, Sarah!!!
Beautiful video.I love your songs \nGreetings from Poland :)
I have never been in a relationship before but this video somehow melted my heart.
WoAhhhhh
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️

Anyone realized that after party studios produced this? (Callux's company) pretty dope!
The only you song that I know and will recognize is by Captin Jack.
I love the vibe of Sarah songs😭💗 soooooooo goooood
Who would dislike this
I'M SO PROUD OF SARAH I LEGIT CRYING RN AAHHH
Maybe you will get some @ChillNation support for this one. Awesome Track! 😍
Sarah's voice is so relaxing and soothing
I love it! Now give me a slow one of just you and the piano. Gosh, I'd love that.
When I first saw her friends I thought that was jake paul Paul and Erika Costel
Wow video quality is great and the song is good 8.5/10 😂
Thought that was Pewdiepie in the thumnail
That's great , loved it !!!!!
Who wants Sarah to cover 1800 by logic?
Sounds like a Trap Nation song
absolutely amazing video, well done, you should be so proud!! Love it 💜
What’s callux’s opinion on your “boyfriend”
Wtf is Gareth Walker from Fifa 17-18 doing on here then
Sarah words can’t describe how good this is
I discovered you just a few days ago and girl I'm IN LOVE 😍 this is a fave song so far, been on repeat for past 4 days.
Still can’t take the song seriously when it’s Gareth Walker In the video ahaha
Looks like Sarah is team Walker.
Willne send me here but this is so good😍
im sorry for laughing but i cracked up at the first shot when she's in the bathtub and the angle is so funny 😂
NEED a behind the scenes! Loved this! X
Probably my favourite songs of hers or call me out xxx
Was the other people she went to the beach with her friends or was it suggesting they were all a bit more than friends?
This is just magical
wow this is an amazing video, loved it
your fave could never outdo mine when it comes to third wheeling 🤷🏽‍♂️
I heard this song for the first time this morning and i'm loving it! Everything about it
SUCH A GOOD ONE!!! So proud Sarah!!! <3
Such a beautiful video, this opened up a completely new meaning to the song which just shows your ability to write a song that is translatable in other ways to others, one of my favourite songs at the moment and for sure a fave video of yours Sarah x
Class. She really is class.
Hey!! It’s Gareth Walker.

When he stole her treat and she hissed, it dropped out of his mouth and I busted out laughing 😂😂😂
I just adopted a kitten on September 30th and she is so cute! Our older cat is still not happy but there is progress. When she sees the kitten or the kitten is near her she makes a huff sound. I can't even explain, but it's hilarious. I decided to name the kitten Bella and Belle for short. She's a bit shy but she's starting to show her personality. I can't wait to see more of Daisy, she's adorable.
OMG the cutie LITTLE BABY \n\n\n\n\nIAM DYING BY THE CUTENESS HELP ME

video says hidden features and guy starts showing the interior lights. nice.
More like a hidden lack of interior features
Kinda really hate how he slaps every button and item he goes to touch or activate. You’d think he’d be more gentle or careful with someone else’s car, especially one that’s so rare right now
Car looks very cheaply made...
Model X does have lighted vanity mirrors.
The only model 3 in depth review is made by the most annoying guy ever... please somebody do reviews about this car
Is it just me or would you also freak out seeing how that guy treats your brand new Model 3?\n\nUnbelievable how he: \n\n- hammers on the display (it's called touch screen)\n- slams the glove compartment and hitting alloy decor with his phone\n- treats the coat hook\n- slams the charge port\n- puts aero craps on top of each so that they will scratch \n- closes frunk hood with one hand (other video) \n-       slams the doors \n\nPutting a promotion video on YouTube and demonstrating how you treat other peoples property is not a smart idea. Definitely not the place to leave a Model 3 or any other car for detailing.
My infiniti fx35 has alot more features that this car, i will cancel my deposit soon
dude, take it easy with the coffeine/coke/speed or whatever. you almost ripped that poor charging door off..
Why is he so damn ROUGH?
Too bad about the interior........just slap a big Samsung tablet....that's it...done.....come on cheap.... doesn't seem very practical......
So they said they reducing features to make the Model 3 cheaper yet they put in bullcrap pointless features where you have to roll a little wheel for ages just to move your steering wheel up or down?? Why not just a lever you pull where it adjusts in 2 seconds? they could have brought this car to 30k if they took out silly lazy features
When I bring my car in please be more gentle to it unlike in the video.
Some great voice commands lol............ fail
Oh wow you in the bay im from Oakland. Just found your channel I love the in-depth stuff on the Tesla. One day I’ll have one.
Get a Leaf......  Better yet, get yourself a chevy......
Minimalism is a positive word
How does the leg room feel in front and rear seats compared to S and X?
Thanks for sharing - FYI 'lighted' is not the past tense of light.
More like lack of features. The Model 3 is a piece of shit. Also whats the song in intro? thanks.
This video is chock full of weapons grade derp...
Did the owner of this car like you f*cking with it like this?
Phone charging cable was installed incorrectly.  High gloss part along leading edge of phone tray slides left to remove.  This reveals proper routing areas for cables.  Route cables then slide trim piece back on.\n\nOh...fyi...trunk release from inside is federal requirement.  They must be visible so they are either lit or glow in the dark.
I think you find if you are small enough to get locked in your frunk that the light actually goes off when you close it. Otherwise it would be on all the time....
Will the frunk open when you press the button inside while driving?
didn't they just change the new iphone charging port?! lolllll why would you put non standardized proprietary charging phone cord in a car.... must be because elon is in love with apple.
Maybe if you pressed the screen even harder things would work better? :)
A trunk/frunk interior release is a US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard. It is required for all cars made after 2000.  People have died in trunks because there wasn't a way to get out until the mandate .... FYI.
As a huge Tesla fan, I love LOVE the concept of over-the-air-updates.  What other car can ship without functionality but then have it magically update later?  Can't wait till they do the radio.
That's a really bad interior.  No thanks.
As a car, this is just terrible. It makes no sense unless you absolutely MUST have an electric car. Which at the moment you don't need.
You could just put a wireless charging pad there
Drill the whole at the bottom of the opening instead.
No, tell us how you really feel about that piano black trim.
Tesla philosophy: keep things simple by making them complicated and distracting to use. The whole industry needs to give up that minimalist shit. Nothing will EVER work better than actual dedicated buttons.
Is this someone’s car that’s supposed to be getting detailed?
So good filming on the fly! 👍 lovin’ the videos of the model 3 so good a car guys review! not a tech guy who bangs on about the trunk and hubcaps
Please have talk with your camera man....
How do you turn on the turn signals? There doesn't seem to be a turn signal stalk...
a gun, a pistol, a knife cos you know you are psychopath... dude thumbs up just for that Lol xD
This guy is definitely what we call a Grobmotoriker in Germany.
Please stop trying to be funny.
How cheap and shit the new model 3 is lol go get an i3 if u want hi tech Tesla is a joke
Release button in the frunk?  You forgot to insert dead - or semi-dead body joke
Question what is that window on the back deck going into the trunk for?
how many model 3's are going to get smashed because someone wanted to steal that huge tablet
Basically the video tells me that Tesla buyers are beta testers for the company
Its a government regulation to have a release mechanism on the inside of a trunk.
I am not really a big fan of the interior of this car. Not having the dials immediately in front of you is just annoying and overall the lack of buttons, controls, or features makes it look and feel cheap IMHO.
Can you show a full sized carryon in the frunk and a full sized checked bag in the trunk?
frunk inside release button is probably for kids
Tesla said the series 3 don't have it and will not have it either
....like the iPad glued to the dash? Looks out of place.
USB means you can use wireless charger of your choice!!
I totally thought this guy was on crack
Where is the spare wheel?
For Android phones and now the iPhone 8/X, are the USB ports the fast charging type ie USB-PD?
This guy ripped off your video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxPoVcauk4I
Best information about the model 3 these days. You guys do a good job.\nOve\nT&T TESLA
Great first looks! Can you point out all the speakers? i think there’s supposed to be 15 of them on the premium package one that you have including a small sub!
The more I see this car the less I like it. Literally looks like a toy car.
Leave it to Tesla to overcomplicate something as simple as the steering wheel adjustments...........
I love Tesla but i´m sorry, i can´t with that interior...
Joe, can you do a video about installing a dash cam in a Model 3? Specifically if there is a 12v source wire harness in the headliner above the rearview mirror, like there is in the Model S?
MANHANDLING SOMEONE ELSE'S CAR?\nOFF CENTER LICENSE PLATE?
The small round cover you showed on the front bummer is for a release cable to open the front trunk from out side if the car battery is drained . Also could you show the cable and the plugs that came with the car ?
At the rate production is going I am hoping for 2020 on the pre order.
I don’t think you drill the bumper on the front plate. Are you sure the screw positions are now to hold the plate to the frame?
your phone is a BRAHHHH! LOL
Can the coat hook hold a dead body?
Lol @ “ I haven’t went around feeling coat hooks in cars” 😂😂😂
appreciate the video, but he's kind of annoying and amped up.. definitely rough with the interior and exterior as well.
This dude is trolling way too much with the psychopath shit ._.
Model X has lighted vanity mirrors. They're just super difficult to access.
Thanks for all the Model 3 vids great job!
Can you please do a video on the power cord the comes with the Model 3?
Hey Guys.. thanks for nice videos.. can you show back seat leg room comparison between S and 3 ? Thanks.
First year new model with lots of new technologies and high pressure to meet order commitment.  What can possibly go wrong...
USB Ports.... Ports....
Lighted!!! Illuminated ffs
Model x has lighted vanity mirrors.
ugly steering wheel
Loved it!
Without a regular speedometer I was hoping it would be on a heads up display
Interior looks so cheap.
What's with the unfinished ceiling panel in the trunk? Now I need to go see if my cars have unfinished ceiling trunk panels. At least the metal panels could have been fully painted if not finished. Doesn't that seem a little cheap? What car have you purchased where you can see paint overspray on an unfinished panel? I'd be surprised to see that on any car let alone a Tesla.
How’s the stereo?
Kool, I can't wait for mine. Thanks Very Much!
I expected the car to be unsafe and unergonomic because of the lack of a gauge cluster, but now that I've seen the real thing, the left edge of the infotainment screen where the virtual gauges are displayed is close enough to the steering wheel that it shouldn't be an issue. I think they must have either widened it or moved it to the left since the first beta model we were shown a year ago.
Hmmm, just watched a few of these and their is a lot of ignorance presented.  Like the front plate issue.  Weird camera work too.  Done.  Bye.
Im sure that the premium option would have different trims for the center console, I would want whatever matches the dashboard :)
I'm sad that the glass roof isn't attached to the windshield like in the X :( that really disappointed me.
Do you need to have a front license plate in California?
Where do the turn signal indicators show up?
the functionality of the scrolls on the steering wheel can be customized in through the display. I forget how you access it, but there is a video on youtube of someone taking delivery and the tesla person goes over it.
what happened to video of white model 3?
Do you know if it can tow?  Do you know the capacity?
Am I the only one who thinks it looks awful both outside and on inside?
Can Tesla please let someone *who isn't a FUCKING MORON* do these videos next time?
Such an idiot, criticizing a concept car, very clever
all her videos are so aesthetically pleasing omg. they make you feel so cozy haha.
The biggest mystery of the year, was it an owl or a pigeon ? 😂❤️
What’s that noise in the background?? Is it the camera moving or the microphone moving or something??
the camera noises while focusing drive me crazy
wow those orange pants look so lovely on you
Who else agrees Zoe should do best friend (mark) boys my outfits like if you agree so Zoe can see this ❤️

I will always belong to this family
Come on u Spurs \nArsenal are rubbish now you need new blood the management are complacent
This clown and all of you are deluded.. Alexis gives the ball away more than every other player in the entire premier league, check the stats from last year, he's the only player in the top six teams that's in the top 20 but he's in first place and gave the ball away 100 times more than the guy thats in second.. I can't say how much goals were given directly to the opposition  because of this guy's selfish style of hogging the ball and trying to dance with it every chance he get but it's a big fukkin problem and you guys have to stop with the special treatment all the time.. that's why he can't get along with Vidal in the national team because he's fukkin selfish when it comes to the football pitch.. we really should sell him in January because he wants to go anyways and we'd get a few quid out of it..
I like how no one here is a arsenal fan
There is nothing left in football.
i thought crack was mental
DT is still only fun when they lose
Arsenal are doing good but DT u over expect everything. You said oh West Brom had chances u expect them to dominate every game of course the other team will always get shots off u can’t expect them to keep the opposition not have a chance.
Robbie you should make playlists for every team we play and add on them the next time we play them
Alaba you've had your 10 goals go away!
Again with the trending wtf is going on,but to be fair the lets talk about the game comment was hilarious 😂😂👍🏻
https://youtu.be/uupZlTULD1w this will help you get over your shit game
It is too early to talk about signs .. he is correct we have to see how we play away in the coming 5-6 premier league games.. Everton, Man City, Watford .. would be the test.. Hope we rest our players in europa and EFL cup .. and then put up a performance like we did at Chelsea and this time take 3 points not just 1.

Good job Arsenal! You have avoided defeat for weeks!\n\nIn other news, Robbie has reportedly been delaying his downpayment for a new mansion, citing 'temporary loss of income' as the reason.
Man Utd for life! We will win the league
In subscribing to anybody how subs me untill I reach 100 subs\nComment done
This guy is a mug
City and spurs gonna smash Arsenal 5 nil
wtf is happening peeps bitchin over Sanchez get a grip,i do agree with DT we are riding our luck
Alexis fan tv, kissing his ass while he disrespect ur club lol. Smh
Arsenal is shit, Chelsea for the win
I dont get the sanchez haters.....i really dont. I said b4 its likely people who cheer on wenger that booo sanchez but its beyond that. I genuinely think they dont understand football and aint worth debating with.
The emerates has the worst atmosphere out of every league!
Next week well be very interesting goo.gl/b5Nh2T
DT is on point right there
when Arsenal win Robbie has to get 'creative' with video titles...
is this fatty ever happy if we had lost he'd be screaming we have to learnt how to win ugly theres really no pleasing arsenal fans take the 3 points and the clean sheet and move tf on
DT ...I hear you on the poor performance...but we slowly getting the 3 points...
I don't get it half the time we lose we moan we draw we moan we win we all still moan what the hells going on we still won don't care who were playing we still won lol
3-4-3 Formation is killing Arsenal's season
Really poor? They won two nil.
If Alexis leaves then let's see how this team copes. The guy was a star player for Barcelona in his last season
DT is only being like this because he deludedly thinks that he may stay.
DT complaints way over the top sometimes. why not win ugly and get 3 points than dominate and get nothing and still complain.
Mad that DT gets more views nowadays than Claude
DT is RIGHT! we're doing well against lesser teams but let's see it goes against the bigger clubs and I don't mean just drawing against them! I mean solid performances and wins. Coyg!
This bloke is a total cock !!!
Sanchez don't even want to be at arsenal why back a judus
DT needs. To chill relaxing like he's beast.
'Lacazette looks clinical, he hit the post today' ffs
DT is one of the few Arsenal fans who have a true sense of perspective. \n\nBut we all know how the season's story is going to turn out for Arsenal. We don't need DT's wisdom to tell us. Because we've been reading the same book for thirteen seasons.
When are arsenal fans going to understand that arsenal is a mid table team glory days are over
Why interview a moron? Couldn't give a toss what he thinks. Whinging bloke can't even speak English, I'm embarrasssed for him.
Am i the only one who cracks up when i see the view count that aftv have when arsenal wins and then compare it to when arsenal loses? Lol
C'mon DT just chill man. Every team has problems. I know Arsenal have been playing some shocking football, but can't blame the defence all the time. Look at Real Madrid today. They won 2-0 but Espanyol had 2-3 really good chances. I know that you had enough of poor Arsenal, but start supporting the team rather than critizising their every mistake.
They could have had this they could have had that... could have and should have are two different things!! Are you forgetting that arsenal also hit the bar and had more chances in this game?? Think you need to stop being a pessimist and support your club.
well said DT. today's game was just too slow and not scoring the needed goals
DT is right on the money... except for the contradiction regarding the squad making progress. If we have the potential to compete for top 3 then that's clearly progress compared to previous analysis stating we probably won't make top 4. \nI'm Still #WO (since '08)
Alexis is the number one arsenal
Didnt know why iwobi was in the background.
Sorry but arsenal fan tv would not be the same if you won the league and cups because DT n Troopz wouldnt be mad. Love there reactions 💯👊🏼
Ramsey and Giroud totally overrated! There is more goals in Wilshire and Walcott at the moment!
While the Manchester clubs and Spurs are banging 4 against so called lesser teams, we are just about scoring 2 and riding our luck. Bigly. \n\nWe need to sort this defence and also get Sanchez, Laca and Ozil playing together. That front three could do wonders for us this season and when Jack gets in (if he can keep this form), our midfield can be way more creative than the staleness we are witnessing now. \n\nBut much of this wont matter if we dont sort this defending out. Wenger should try 4 at the back and see how we play. Its been a while but I think we'd be more solid.
Riding our luck Our xg was 2.9, Brighton's was 0.4. DT is a complete moron
I never even knew Alexis had haters he holds are team on his back he is Arsenal.
Give Aresnal team some credits pls... as for DT .. I dun know who u are... but seems like you are nothing but a very negative person.
I think Alexis, maybe because they both speak spanish, has a better understanding with Monreal than with Kolasinac, on that left side. Hopefully with more matches Alexis and Kolasinac can get a better undrstanding and improve each other performances , because Kolasinac is a beast, and Monreal is having a amazing season in his new position so i wouldn't change there positions.
Why is this even a topic. Laca should have played sanchez in for a tap in !!
This is actually trending. DT one of the best personality on AFTV
Arsenal should of won 5,6-0
People forget Alexis had some very rough international games where he lost the confederations cup and then lost 2 games (qualifiers). He´s got a lot in his head at this point, not only Arsenal, and this is not to make any excuses, but come on, those fans giving him shit... they should be bothering the board to get rid of Wenger and the lazy players, instead of bothering the only guy that gave everything for his team last season.
i like you DT but do you ever say anything positive
Did you see that ludicrous display last night?
DT is definitely the realest amongst all the other AFTV regulars. He may be biased towards some players but he lenient towards them when they’re shit. I like him better now than when he was all “Wenger Out”.\n\nNot saying that Wenger should stay beyond the 2 years though. ;)
I hope you're dream comes true my dream is to get 100 subscribers by the end of the month can you please help me with my dream?!!
Once we  start playing the ball sideways it is Xhaka's role to collect the ball and spread the ball to the right forward. When the game gets boring we should blame him, he is our engine at the same time passing the ball sideways can be a way to rest after running so much and try to pull the opponents. #wearethearsenalfc
Again DT is absolutely right! Arsenal progress with frail teams but crumble ever so easily against big and technically strong premier league clubs. If Arsenal beat Any of the top 6 teams away the same way we beat lowly rated clubs in the premiership, then the world can take our title credentials very serious, as it is there's no amount of points you can amass from smaller clubs that can justify winning the premier league trophy.
Robbies just thinking about how he's getting to Ibiza next week, by his private yacht or his private jet?
Arsenal is shit end off.
hey robbie id like to know if you will be going to the world cup next year, i think it would be cool if you go along with the aftv boys(troopz, dt etc.) like if you agree
these ungrateful fat fucks never touched a ball in their greasy lives stfu!!!!!!!

👍👍😎😎📀
I love how cozy your vidoes have been recently.
I loved the video, Amelia! You looked absoultely stunning with just mascara, you should do it more often! Also your answers were really nice, you seem like a really down to earth kinda person - very lovely!
Thank you for the honesty Amelia ! I also wanted to share that as soon as you said that you come from everywhere I knew you had to Middle Eastern. I feel like middle easterns have been so shamed over the past decade that they ended up believing (myself included) that they should be ashamed of where they come from and that being Middle Eastern makes you less valuable to others. It is so sad. I am both lebanese and canadian. When friends used to ask me where i reaaaally come from, I used to be so ashamed and I used to make up pretty stupid lies to say that I was italian. Looking back at it now, I am so proud to be lebanese. I am also proud to be canadian. And whoever treats me differently after knowing where I reaaally come from is the problem. They're what's wrong, not me. LOVE LOVE :)
Shout out to your family and friends taking pics: they do a great job! Thank you for sharing their work!
Duke :3 such  a cutie pie
Interesting video, thanks, enjoyed that.
You are such a ray of sunshine amelia <3 much love from the Philippines!

Now do answers you have never questioned
I really enjoyed this laidback video :) Especially you answering the “work” questions:) Now my question may seem weird, but I’ve been reading so much about this so I’m curious about your thoughts: Why don’t you have business account on Instagram? And maybe any comments on Instagram and it’s current algorithm? How do you find it?
I am from Iraq thats really interesting to know where  u r from ...love ur videos
Your mum and friends make amazing pictures. Job well done. I am a huge advocate for if you can do it yourself you do it yourself. It saves so much money as well and the results are amazing. Xx
I have one question, I just wonder if you and Tijan are still friends. I don’t mean to be too intrusive I’m just curious cause you seemed to be old friends. \n\nKisses from Dominican Republic!

Loved the video !!  (but i do feel guilty about it, like i don't want you to feel like you have to answer such personal questions)
Really appreciated your honesty here. I know how the YT community tends to stray away from 'taboo' questions such as these. And please keep us updated with 23andMe! Been wanting to try it myself for years!
Can't wait for the Vlogs!!😘😘❤️❤️

Why are your eyes so far apart?
I would love to win your giveaway 😍😍
“Good God almighty, good God almighty, that killed him…as God as my witness he is broken in half”
YOU JUST MADE THE LIST
Did that look fake to anyone else
it's fake, now back to my porno because that's real
It looks like he hurt his lower back during that takedown and his opponent notices it and be like fck it Im Doing the Walls of Jericho Maaaaannnnnn!
Fake as fuck
WWE fans here>
Looked scripted to the fuck..
Punches were half hearted. Reactions to them were too strong.
MMA fans are the most retarded fans in all of sports. Everything is fake except mma 😂
It's fully legit and it would break you in half . It's all about posting luck we're you end up out of a scramble. This is a rare finish to get the two legs
Looks 100 percent fake.  I've been rolling for over 10 years and NEVER seen anyone lay there while a guy fumbles with his legs, or roll stomach down from love taps.   Troll.  That was the SLOWEST leg grab / clumsy as hell transition that I've ever seen.
Next please God let someone win a mma match with a RKO or a Stone Cold STUNNER
He helped him by ajusting his leg lmfao. Fake as fuck
i thought you couldnt attack the spine and small joints?
Is it me or does the screaming dude slick sound like Paul hey man for a second
Get the fuck outta here lol
Ya wtf, did Michael Bolton make the finish here or what?  And how the fuck is it a Walls of Jericho when he just stole that move, originally called the Boston Crab
I do this to the misses when she ain't givin it!!!
And your new WWE champion is......
Clearly fake. If it was real they would be continuously ringing the bell while he nods his head to apply more pressure.
Walls of Jericho? That move is older than WWE... If only they watched good old Lucha Llibre........
you know what happens when you use the walls of jericho without jerichos permission ?\nyou know what happens !!
That was some seriously fake shit right there.  Anyone who actually believes that was not a work, I have some prime real estate on the moon to sell you. Dirt cheap.
Dude that lost looks like he's never seen any type of grappling before. \n\nEither he was that bad and unskilled or this is fake as fuck.
It's not fake. Allegedly he slipped a disc in his spine on that dlt so you can only imagine the effect of contorting his legs and lower bavk
lion tamer is much better than the walls
That actually does work.. it seems like he got it to easy but that shit actually hurts enough to get someone to tap... you back can only bridge so far and the more he goes the more pressure on your chest... bushing up only hurts your back more...its hard to explain you must experience it to know what i mean.
FAKE
Boy was that set up. No way in hell a pro fighter would let anyman sit on his back and slowly grab both of his legs smh. When i saw this i thought there was going to be some crazy set up to get the sub but that was just one guy allowing the other guy to do it wtf is that bs
B. e. a. utiful
If you ever been on this submission you will know that this move makes it hard for people to breathe when in this position
I need to do this when i fight someone
Fixed, Zangief from street fighter was trying to get into the move before it was being done on him...
It's not Boston Crab, it's just crap
Where are the other fights ?
This looked fake as hell, dude was making zero effort to get up at 0:30, just let it happen.
That was an insult to anyone with eyes.
some moves are in the WWE are effective in real life combat situation
The way the guy was making weird faces the whole time, and just laying there like a fish out of the water... Looks fake, still fun submission tho
here is a vid I did years ago on half-crab, and a half crab was ACTUALLY legit done in Indian MMA a few years back fyi https://youtu.be/fA1NxkhnYdM
That guys back looked broken from the takedown. Why would you even MMA if you can get beat with THAT pro wrestling move.  Tough way to make a buck
I had the Bolton Crabs ! strange really ? As the Crab had a shaved pussy ?
He knew what he was doing all along, you can tell he had already planned it
imagine if it was the lion tamer
guy hurt himself on the takedown, thats why he could get it
Really looks fake wtf! Why would anyone agree to being embarrassed like that
He tapped only because he hurt his back, You can see him grimacing from pain after the takedown.
fake nothing else to say
Oh my that's so fake. Please don't destroy the reputation of mma with these fake fighters
You just made the list !
Aaron Jones looked hurt after the takedown, then took a good shot to the right eye and went defensive belly down, he was hurt and in cover mode so the boston crab was easy to setup. I think this is legit. You watch too much UFC and you forget there are some pretty bad fighters out there who can get caught by something like this
CAN WE GET A STONE COLD STUNNER NEXT WEEK.
Fucking easy. I always do this to my sister. Lol
BREAK THE WALLS DOWN
Break the walls down
LOL he gave him his right leg.. all he had to do is extend his right leg, get on his right hip and shake his left leg. i cant believe people are falling for this fake bullshit
Guy hurt his back and was winded by the fall, this wouldn't have worked if his opponent was not in a weakened state.
it's bullshit crab
пипец, реслинг теперь в клетке устраивают?))
Fake as fuck.\nThat dude got a pillow punch to the face @:28 and turtled up his face leaving his legs limp for 3 seconds as if he was asleep.\nI call bs
Fake a planned
pmsl nice
Amazing finish!
🎶 You can't wrestle, tan tan tan tan tan 🎶
what a joker
fake and gay
0.27 that fake punch lol
WTF, 100% fake, no way!!!
That looked so homoerotic
Ha
OMG J.R ITS THE WALLLLSSSS!
Faker than WWE
NOT FAKE
Looks faker than WWE.
Fake as shit
looks scripted
Fucking UFC Creative buried him
jajajajajajaj que malos tio
FAKE
WWE FAN HERE
Fake.
WWE
You do realize when applied properly, a boston crab will get you a submission...I've done it; just sayin'.
About as real as a leprechaun flying a unicorn
Alright, Now if they can pull off a Figure-Four or a Sharpshooter, then maybe I’ll watch an MMA match.
That punch was so fake before the SHARP SHOOTER.
BOSTON crab. Not Bolton.
Back in 199X it use to be Boston crab now it's Bolton who?
That looks set up  and definitely not walls of Jericho
Jonno gets style points for sticking the tongue out
That was a pure set up .Pure theaterised shite. Mma fans of purity will have seen tight through that one 👎
Dana White's Lookin For A Fight...... won't be lookin here!
That gay gave that to him
It's not the walls of Jericho.  Jericho puts a knee in ur back
I was literally thinking the other day that I'm surprised a figure 4 leg lock hasn't been done in UFC yet as it's pretty easy to do and extremely effective
scripted better than EastEnders
*BOSTON CRAB
The fact that they called it before he even grabbed both legs makes it look hella fake. Not gonna judge tho.
Probably fake but still that move hurts like fuck, anybody with older siblings who are WWE fans will relate all too well
so YouTube just saw how glorious this video was and it's only number 30 on trending? should be first, trending is rigged
This is a top 30 anime betrayal.
I'll be goddamned. So, George W. Bush DID do 9/11.
I had no idea!
CNN finally understood that's sometimes its better not to say anything than bullshiting
So this is trending but Asian Jake Paul is nowhere to be seen... cool.
Well good job Ajit Pi, my ISP didn't aprove this video.
This does not deserve to be trending. It has no content.
i learned a lot
I find this video very difficult to masturbate to
Great points were made well done boys
Wow that's not weird right a blank video making trending .....CNN no less
doesn't make a video = trending page
The only thing I got from this video is my own reflection.   Is CNN trying to say something?
Generally there is certainly definitely simply no magic, working associated along with the app of infant baby heartbeat listener Tracker- Heartbeat monitors listener free completely is dependent on your own phone's equipment.\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appgametechnologies.baby_heart_rate_monitor_listener&hl=en
Wtf how is this in trending ?
CNN be like “forget fake news, we’re gonna provide no news”\n\nBrilliant.
It rises because it feels like rising. This video explained it well for me. Thanks CNN.
This is as fake as it gets. CNN FAKE NEWS. Also Trump likes big water
Very informative video. 10/10 Would recommend to schools.
Still makes it to trending. What a joke.
Very informative. Glad I watched the whole thing.
How the fuck is this trending
Holy fuck this is revolutionary, I bounced on my boy's dick for days to this. I can't believe that the Vegas shooter was secretly the jet fuel that can melt steel beams. If only Ted Cruz could pull his tiny cock out of his boyfriend's thick ass and do something   about the fucking lizards running our government into the ground and those damn gay frogs putting sulfur in the tap water. Wake up sheeple, Trump is a rat transvestite operated by a transvestite matrix. \n8=============D~ Big Money Salvia Fan
The most truthful video CNN has put out to date!
Best video by cnn I've ever seen
Thanks Paul R. La Monica for telling us the real meaning of the universe.
CnnMoney is so right on here. It's all blackness, all purposeless. Why discuss anything when the void awaits us all at the end.
No, that's not true at all. It's global conspiracy, set forth by a group of wealthy men. And you have a problem with something that the US can beat. you want to see a movie I wanted and how they took a very aggressive approach on the community that it can be difficult to introduce new ideas and it won't happen again next year. I was going camping and it is their responsibly to do so.
Maybe people put alot of money on gun stocks and create mass shootings so they get rich. They get a look alike, make him kill himself or kill him so that the shooter gets away with it. Money is the reason alot of tragedies happen
This video is CNN minus the fake news
CNN is officially a piece of shit
Wtf is the description too. Its like it was made a long time ago... like as if hillary wanted to add more to her kill list.... she did tweet some political shit real fast after vegas
And yet this is trending somehow. Blatant proof channels pay to always be on the recommended page
Gun stock rises and you would think that those gun lovers would save the day. They're nowhere to be found.
That was probably the most informative video I've ever seen from CNN.
Why is 10 seconds of nothing in the Trending tab?
Even they are tired of their BS.
I'm too high for this
Yet another Soros sponsored NWO,RED FLAG HIT JOB! Like Sandy Hook, Giffords, Aurora...That long list of FBI/CIA orchestrated destruction. \nAlmighty God Yahweh you can not get here soon enough to rid the world of this aberrant evil that roams this earth. Luciferians are like bubonic plague ridden rats on a sinking ship! Agape PRAISE El Shaddai Yahweh!
Great video, very educational. We're actually doing a stock market game in my principles of business class and now I know what to invest in. Thanks!
It's because liberals panic and blame guns Everytime something violent happens except for most of the time it happens....aka black on black crime.
This is the first video from CNN that wasn't fake news
Read a book. It's literally people betting on gun regulation. Making guns illegal will cause a supply shock increasing the value of firearms. This supply shock would only give more power to those who have already stock piled weapons. \n\n\nPolitical piece: \nThe black market for firearms is one of the largest black market in the world and worth billions of dollars and with regulation it would only become more valuable. I suspect that this will give a great amount of power to drug cartels and further destabilize Mexico and South America.\n\nIf you made it this far thanks for reading :)
The only way to stop these mass shootings is to allow the arms manufacturers to advertise on TV. That way they will able to pressure the news stations not to broadcast these shootings on the national level. The drug companies did this during the drug-tampering poisonings and they stopped.
The one time CNN doesn't put out fake and it's a black screen
did i miss something on reddit?
Because fuck CNN that's why🖕🏼
This is the best CNN reporting I've ever seen.
If only there were video to make fun of... it must just be YouTube's algorithm that puts this fuckup on trending and demonetizes Steven Crowder.\nFor all of the liberals that were wanting something out of this, you know now what we're seeing.
wow I learned a valuable lesson that mass shootings suck
Who what an informative Great video
Okay the creepiest thing just happened, when this video ended a high pitched screech echoed through my room, it was very scary 😰
I can't believe I left this up in a new tab to watch later and set aside time.  Probably the first time that if it weren't for the comments section I would have regretted watching. Some  of you are rather good at sarcasm.
NOICE! A 10 SECOND LONG VIDEO WITH A BLACK SCREEN
I think I know why, it's because a mass shooting opens the opportunity to put a ban on guns, so people buy as much as they can before it's too late. I think.
How is this on trending, but Content Cop hitting 4M views in a day isn’t?
This deserves to be on trending and Jake Paul content cop doesnt
I believe the actual reason to gun stocks rising is no reason, hence the 10s nothingness.
Well at least this one is unbiased.
If you play this video backwards at 50% speed you can hear the subliminal mind messages.
IF You Look Closely.....This is a comment
The only thing controversial about this video is that CNN made it. That is all it takes for the shills and bot farms to take action
About sums up the content we have come to expect from CNN.
Really nigga? 10 seconds of nothing
Brilliant.
Worst 10 seconds ever.
It starts at 2:27
Okay! Good talk!
lmfao #tragic
Intriguing
COVFEFE
Trending isn't  purchased... #BULLSHIT
Clickbait because someone wanted a gun. 😅

This was AWESOME. Very well done.
Looking forward for you new video! Actually I can't wait like for the water level
Would anyone else here buy this as a soundtrack if he'd make complete versions of these melodies?
Every you did it cracks me up
I really wanna play this game!
I hope someday that someone gets you to score an indie game or something. We nearly cried at the fire level bit XD.
10/10 would purchase fire level soundtrack
That fire level music makes me think of crash bandicoots Arabian levels
Who else thought his t-shirt was saying anus?
I thought his hoodie said ANUS for way too long
I fucking love this guy
Dragon Quest VIII. PS2. Do yourself the favor. Thank me later.
0:27 HOLY SHIT YOU DID IT WAS NUTS
If I ever make a video game I'm hiring this guy for the soundtrack
Why do I enjoy these videos?
Someone grew up with Mario and Zelda 👍.
I imagine how many subs you would have if you would post a video every day! Already with this amount of vids, 536k subs, that's very good! Good job m8!

Omg I'm glad she reacted to moves me!! I want her to remake it lol
Wow at 13 her voice is like that!!\nWhy??\nMe I'm 13 but when I tried to sing like her it sounds like an forlorn cat begging for food..
Wow, I was so happy to see her remember This Is Me! It's definitely one of my favorites from when I was a kid watching Disney Channel every week. I saw Camp Rock when it first premiered!\n\nOn a second note, could you do one with Lady Gaga? Please do the ones she has never sang live before—I Like It Rough, Summerboy, Retro Physical and Retro, Dance, Freak.
I LOVE DEMI SO MUCH I GREW UP WITH HER
I really want to hear her sing This Is Me now
Every time I see her I remember how bad I need to do my eyebrows lolll
OMG she is shaking. I want to hug her :) She's so cute
i love her laugh so much.
Uh is she ok? Her hand was shaking the entire time.
I love Demi... AND I love Pink.... He didn't need to continually bring that up.....They are both Amazing singers...
This is 2017 not 2018 yet
NOW IVE FOUND\nWHO I AM\nTHERES NO WAY TO HOLD IT INNNN
demi is so humble i love her so so much
i love her so fucking much.
Her laugh is so cute!
Demi has the best laugh, and boy did she remember the songs! Spanish was more impressive! you go, girl!\nP.s.: As a Pink fan, I hated everytime he brought up the fact that Pink didn't remember the songs (which was true, but they were songs when she was 16ish, 1995).
I can't even remember what I ate yesterday for dinner😂
oh my god please do this with ed sheeran
I am whiter than snow ad I was OBSESSED with the Spanish version of this is me
Okay who else thinks her first song is a BOP
I don't get it, she's born in 1992, how was she 13 in 2004?
is t weird that I don't know Spanish at all but when ever I hear demi singing in Spanish I know exactly what she's saying and I can sing ahead and translate it to English but when I hear the English version I have no clue what comes next
She didn't know the Spanish version of Skyscraper.
Why is Demi the cuteeeest ever!
Her voice is so freaking goals just looking back at her voice in 2009 and now I would freak out if I was her she has an incredible voice .
This is so nostalgic 😭
You can find the Spanish one is English it's called skyscraper
I wish they played more tbh
Who knows all of em
is it bad that i did know move me????
I wanted them to play a Barney song 😂😂😂
Gotta love that laugh at 3:49
Please do this with miley cyrus! ❤️
isn‘t she the hottest? 😍 please 🙏🏻
OH MY GOD HE PLAYED HER SONG “MOVES ME” IM CRYing
Disney is so attached to spanish. xD
I was literally screaming the camp rock lyrics like girl DONT FORGET PLS (pun intended) DONT SHATTER MY CHILDHOOD
I love her so much!
I was screaming at my screen when she was trying to remember the This Is me lyrics!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
that's my wife 😍
I feel like watching Camp Rock now
idk why but the song that demi made when she was 13 reminds me of tessa brooks singing lol
is it bad that I knew most of them right away... I'm too obsessed
I think I would remember, I still remember the first song i learned in english (i'm swedish), word for word. When I learned it, I didn't know what it meant, but now I'm still singing it, but now I actually can feel what I'm singing.
1:13 - 1:16 I thought my phone was broken
He kept twisting his face when he talked about p!nk. Better stop bashing on my girl, nick :P
Demi I hope to meet you one day
The one when she was 13 - it reminds me of Mackenzie Ziegler for some reason XD
She is so amazing. <3
She sounds beautiful in spanish and her laugh is life❤️😩
gurllll throwing it back to the camp rock days. my heart is very content right now.
Do This With Ariana Grande! I Bet She Forgot The Lyrics To Songs Like ‘Baby I’ ‘Put Your Hearts Up’ Or ‘Pink Champagne’
I cas hopping That she’d sing really her old songs 😂
So mean with the Spanish !!!
She Has A Great Memory & Laugh 🤣🤣❤️
I miss camp rock 😭😭😭😭this is me, gotta find you, demi and jonas brothers moments 😂😂😂OMG gold!!
She’s so pretty
The 2nd one reminds me of britney spears
I'd say 3 out of 3, because she still got it lol.
Damn she sounds so good at 13, by she kinda sounds like early Justin Bieber type song but maybe this was just a trend type thing in the 2000s
She looks so cute when she’s thirteen
Oh my gosh I’m not even a huge fan of Demi and I got the lyrics before her 😂😂
no words can describe how much i love her laugh 💛💛💛☄️
My lovatic ass even got rascacielo. Bitch I’m shook
Her laugh is sooooo contagious!! 😂
Love her laugh
She was shaking 😂😂
Oh shit moves me 😂😂
her laugh <333
Yes Demi!!!!💐💐💐

Idk why but she gives me nicki minaj vibes
Her hands are so shakey
Kelsi monroe. Only real n****z know.
Umm she was 12.. 2004-1992= 12. LEARN YOUR MATHS DUDE.
COMO UN RASCACIELOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Wow she is glowing
She's so gorgeous!!!
Demi is soo pretty
Yay!!......I ❤ U Demi!!.....#Lovatic !!....I am like surprised she is cool and sweet from her beginning😘😘😘😘
Demi Lovato is so beautiful and her voice is so amazing.
Camp Rock was my childhood.
I knew the first part of the camp rock song but hesitated at the same place Demi did haha
You can tell she's nervous trying to think of the lyrics. Her hand looks like it's shaking a bit. She did good though!
Rassasielo 😂😂😂 en vez de Rascacielo. Demi your the best!!! 👏😂❤❤❤❤
Jo tenia la esperanza de que se supiese Skyscraper.. 🤦🏻😂
Puedes llevarte mi ilusión, romperme todo el corazón, como a un cristal.. que se cae al suelooo pero te juro que al final sola me voy a levantar como un rascacielosss como un rascacielosss🎶 que nostalgia😥💕
Normally she hates mooves me
this is me... this mades me some emotional :')
I have 1 pair of shoes and they are reebok white sneakers. I love them to death!
im in love with Connor! i want my guy friends to dress as well as he does.
I just felt like this was sponsored by rebok
DO MORE I LOVE THIS
Look number 3 is a pass. If I had to grade it on a scale of 1 being the lowest to 10 being the highest, I would give it a 3. Again not a fan of those shoes and that sweater is not really that cute. I think had you gone with a white tee shirt and another style reebok shoe I could have given you a higher score
That leather with the sweater 😍
I LOVE THIS. The whole vid is so well thought out and aesthetically pleasing!!
I remember I was literally one of the first people to watch Connor now I never watch him lol.
Why are u so fucking cute?
I want that orange sweater really badly
that yellow sweater is $775 um what
YOUR YELLOW SWEATER IS $775 WHAT THE FUCK HONEY
His style is literally my inspiration
you're such a bean ily
if i was a man, this is what would inspire my life
When you live in Canada and would freeze your ankles if you rolled your jeans
Last look went from daddy to smol bean when u took the leather jacket off
Congrats buddy. You're still working hard to reach the top. However I'm still waiting for my signed book... It's been over 5 months since the UW meet and greet. Thanks dude. Cheers from Seattle
EDITING ON POINT\n\nUr killing it connor
How is your library soo color coordinated??? Im so jealous
I really do love you
LOOK AT YOU GO
Someone should make a meme of that clap and 'go me' I would use it all the time😂😍
I struggle so much trying to find a balance between streetwear and dress up, like I love being very put together but also comfy, something between Gabrielle Chanel and Kurt Cobain. Also minimalism and boldness. Alessandro Michele got me so good for this season and the next one. Ugh. Anthony Vaccarello and Lorenzo Serafini were SOOO good. Ugh.
You look sassy sweetheart. Love ya and love your style. I love autumn. It brings out a great feeling of love and romance. It changes me more inside than any other season. And love buying new clothes. Take care.
love love love this video, more look books to come? ily v much
I don't want to those kind of video from you about fashion to end . 💕
I JUST BOUGHT A PAIR OF REEBOK CLASSICS LAST WEEK I FEEL SO COOL YAY
He got them good ankles omg Connor 😂 I love you

Does anyone else feel that they are really hideous that style is shit
He's so cute! I wanna give him a hug :')

Connor have you seen the trailer for the movie Call Me By Your Name, or read the book? I'm absolutely in love with it!
Do you want to visit Russia? 😃

The name of the show should be Garbage Disposer lol
ECW!\nECW!\nECW!
Go vegan
Very impressive!
I love the way you explain things so clearly and thoroughly while remaining concise.
The strenght is pretty impressive. I'm still not sure if I would trust it for climbing rocks or something, even in a survival situation.\n\nHow about a quick follow up video testing out how much it would take to for the rope to snap? That way you have a general idea of what to expect from it. Maybe one test where you do a quick drop with weights to test the toughness and one test where you keep adding weights untill it snaps to test tensile strenght?
I would love to have some tea with you and just pick your brain, I could learn so much from you and it would be great to just hang with you.
you get a like just for the actual vid quality in this vid! I forgot youtube can be sharp!
I downloaded both of you rope making videos. Thanks for sharing. Not sure if I will ever need this technique, but if I ever will need it I know now how to make both ropes. One with green grass and one with dried grass.
*Now i can kill myself with grass*
Let's see if you can make something from cattail  stalks. Can you try to make a basket or some other woven type of item with it? Cattails are common in most of Canada and the U.S.
for a more natural suicide
N o o s e
is it just me or.... what frame rate is this shot in?? LMAO
I thought you could and you just showed us, well done.
That should come in handy next time I'm taking the One Ring to Mount Doom.\n\nUnless someone already made that reference in the old video.
I think you're really good at explaining stuff. I actually listened and watched this whole video. I also learned something new. Thank you! You're awesome.
Cockeyed thumbnail that is all goodbye!!!
Thanks.  Quite helpful.
wtf am doing here ???????
8:11
love the video
Survival bondage improvisation
Grope
You're always great, thank you
try pulling a car with it that will definitely tell its strength.
can you whip with it?
Its also good to feed to cattle or rabbits if you have some, after use and without any coating or oil/tar treatments of course.
I'm wondering what other plants you would use instead of grass like maybe inner tree bark I've heard that might work
Where did you lean all your skills?
It's not immune to cows and can't be made in Antarctica too, except for hair
Now I can hang myself with nature
Awesome, thanks for keeping it simple and useful.
You could also test it even further with a mechanical advantage from a lever
legend
I see some disc golf in that yard.
only nighthawks beat round the bush to find grass
If you live just west of where i live there is no rope making material:(
Nice! A project that any budget can handle. :)
Whoa a new improved method! This was one of the most important survival tips I've learned and now it's even better.
Hey its vinny vinesauce teaching me how to make rope.
Amazing video as usual. This one I'm going to try for sure. A bit more detail on waterproofing would be useful !
nice way of making a noose.
This is soooo useful! :D Thanks a lot! And easy tooooo
This is soooo useful. . . . . .in a post nuclear holocaust world with apocalyptic circumstances!  You know, when all the normal rope is disappeared or burned to ashes.  Imagine the horror of living in a world without rope! It's gonna happen so pay attention!
Please never sell out......\nDont become Grant Thompson
Hard to take advice after seeing your vice set-up.
So it looks a little bit nicer in the end.  Which end?  I'm confused.\n\nPrimer:  C'mon, guys, wake up!  Where are all the rope puns?  What are you a frayed of?  This is knot cool.  I'm gonna wrap this up.
Wow I've never seena  video like this on youtube..
I'm making this rope right now! It's really quick without much practice !
thank you, it's useful to make a suicide rope
when it comes to grass, I find the more you use, the happier you are with the end result.
and if you want to make even stronger rope you could take 3 of these and and wave them (like: swap left with middle, then middle with right, and then left and middle again and so on)
love your videos. you should test the strength in a more scienticic way you know with the weight and length and flexibility and how much strength it actually looses when it gets wet or dry. sorry if  i sound like a university professor
Great now people can still hang them selfs when they leave there noose in the car
Make concrete from scratch or build a clay house
Great! Strong enough to hang myself before I starve to death
Interesting video Thanks
I see shai La Beuf
Very cool, thank you.
Good video.
It's more like 80-85 pounds because you're also pulling the rope.
Only one more way to conclusively  test it.....
Bark fiber works well for rope. Watch some videos from Primitive Technology.
how thin can ya go \ndestruction test please
You have Frisbee golf course in your yard?
This is Incredible! I love it.
WOW! WOW WOW
Needed some rope to tie something up but forgot that I had smoked it all up last night lol.
I imagine there's a way to make the rope usable in less than a day. Probably by oven, or near a fire, or something
Primitive technology
Very cool. Thanks!
thats actually really nice, i might let a patch of grass grow up next year to try this.
I'd say this rope turned out plenty strong for all the things I use rope for... \n\n*realizes the only test was if it could support his own body weight*\n\nOh no. People have so much to live for... anyways I love your videos!! Keep up the great work!
Would have been funny when you let go at the beginning it cut to a really deep revine and the video cuts to black and that's the entire video.
You're freaking me out because you look like a cross between Ethan h3h3 Klein and Matt Peake
I would love more survival and primitive stuff.
Can you do some strength tests on different grass?
You do good things man, hope you can keep it up!
This is great!  Now when some one tells me that if it ever came to a survival situation they would rather just die, I can reply 'How are you going to kill yourself if you don't even know how to make rope out of grass?'  and proceed to teach them how if they are interested.
But can you kill yourself with it?
I'm gonna try doing this with paracord, if it works it should end up being pretty damn strong.
I made that grass rope and I fell out of a tree but in advance I plan for that so I made a grass I can it might have grass so I can't believe you actually work and the kind of Saved My Life from like 20 foot fall onto rocks so because you told me to make the grass when the grass is wet then that has saved my life thank you
@TheKingOfRandom
Cool
4K 60FPS
Very scientific progress update, thank you!!  Love this type of video, about something so simple, yet so useful.
It would be cool to see a video on how to splice sections of completed rope if, for example, multiple people were working towards a single very long rope
How about showing us how to extract oils from wood? They are very useful too. \nGreat video, as always!
Great video, sir. Always enjoy learning new and interesting things.
Hi, I can't speak for any of your other viewers, but I really enjoy these scripted or planned videos a little bit more than ones that are in the moment. I find that the content is higher quality but regardless of what you post, I will love it. You are awesome.
has any one even notice the tree that the guy is next too has a face! o.O come one people just take a look at it. Eyes, nose, mouth. O.O if you look closely enough you actually see like it has some arms and legs morphed into it. lol
improve your videos by LESS chit-chat and MORE action, thanks....
That was sweet! Thanks for sharing, I'll try this next time I'm camping
cool video
If you decide the rope isnt long enough can you just undo the knot and lengthen it without problem?
I love these videos. Very practical and not gimmicky like some other DIY channels out there (DIY Perks) :3
I believe that like in basket making you can soak too-dry grass/fibers to twist a rope. great video, I decided one day not too long ago to make grass cordage and made about 20 feet of 3/16 ish cordage out of, I think, saw grass, but it was green and just for fun, as the fall settles in I plan to harvest more to make more cordage, and harvest a lot of cattails for eventual basket weaving
do you live in maine by chance?
Is it possible to clean the rope by running it over a weak fire quickly or would the chance of it catching on fire be too high?
Whats the name of that disc golf course?
This was a pretty interesting tutorial. Much easier than braiding it. That is what I originally thought you were going to be doing.
I was gonna say he was very biased to how good the product was because he's getting paid to say good things about it. Then it hit me...
Love you Blake 😘😘😍😍
I love all of your songs Blake Shelton!! I really do.

Cool! I love your songs . Selmo from Brazil

I absolutely LOVE this song! Not to mention A LOT of your songs Blake! Faithful fan here! Your music never ceases to amaze me!
Blake did you ever live in Wichita Falls Texas and have an uncle named Glenn Shelton that work for the Wichita Falls Times news
Name the dog Blake.
Who wrote the song? The concept is brilliant!\n#countrymusic
Here are my heroes of my youth!! and 30 years later they still rock!
True rock and roll craftsmen!
Amazing, more than 30 years after 'that song' and not just as good, but even better! Counting down the days (16 now)  untill the new album arrives!
Thank you Europe for giving us such amazing songs!!! I really like this video, all the best for you Joey, John N, Mic, John L, Ian... Cheers from Chile :)
BRAZIL
*EUROPEEEEEEE* AMAZING!
ohhh yeah!!!!!!! I knew you would have done a great job !!!! THANK YOU GUYS!\nYOU ARE WONDERFUL, A DOOR WITH OPEN EYES !!! I LOVE YOU!!
ΕUROPE FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!! FROM GREECE WITH ALL MY LOVE....
So beautiful!!
Those who disliked this video are filled with SHIT!
Tears in my eyes! Thank you. I bought my verry first single as a child. It was  the final countdown of cause. My brother laught about me and about this pop music. Back these days. Today he is one of youre biggest fan
*I found a little Deep Purple feel on it!* 😉
For some reason I recognize the melody for the refrain from somewhere else..
I love this guys!!
Europe you are ture rock legends awesome video walk the earth  keep on writing awesome songs 😊😊
At 0:34 it seems the Sports Hall from 86's The Final Countdown video, only now it's decayed. I don't go on with parallels, 'cause I still love Europe: the song is great, but it deserved a more uplifting video.
Very good video and song!
So great ! Thank you .
Every band sooner or later try to do their own Kashmir...
Verse reminds me of Deep Purple - Fingers to the Bone.
More carpets to a god of carpets!
From all the legendary come backs I think yours guys really stands out. Amazing
Congratulations for this video I'm very proud of you. You deserve  the best with this new album. I have not stopped seeing it all day and every time I like more. It is very mysterious to me in some things but if you are happy is the most what it matters .Together walking the Earth with heart and Soul like champions
Love the track and the video, keep on rocking!
Good...but i think very similar to NLIT and NSSTB. It can be more....
Somebody have to make video for  this song together with Game of Thrones parts
Europe at it's very best.
Joey should've worn the purple jacket from Superstitious instead of that fur looking thing!
I must say, you guys have literally shaped my childhood into what it is. I usually write my books to your music because it really gets me in the zone. My dad finds it funny that I can relax to bands like Metallica and then go completely hyper whenever I hear anything to do with you :)
Absolutely love this song and video!!!  You Dudes definitely know how to Rock!!! Looking forward to your USA tour!!
Can't wait for the record,amazing song
So proud of you! \n\nplease come back to Brazil soon cause I really wanna sing this one live
The best album from Rainbow in a long time
Hope the whole album will be as good as the title track. Already in love with that song!
Love new songs europe

Har dem någonsin låtit bättre!!!?? Amazing!!!!
Europe forever ! Let's Rock ! \nO Brazil tem ama ❤🎵✌
Great tune! Miss johns Fender sound though. Imagine that solo with the sound from the Wings of tomorrow album. Would be a killer.
Europe, my favorite band all over the others i have listen to. Such great inspirated songs like Memories, Scream of Anger, Children of this time, In the future to come, Open your heart, Dreamer, Stormwind, Wings of tomorrow, Coast to coast, Danger on the track, Rock the night, Let the good times rock, Carrie, More than meets the eye, The Final Countdown, Dance the night away, Seven doors hotel, I'll cry for you, Superstitious, Cherokee... all of them such great. And you guys are still here giving the best! Thanks for that! Have a great time and keep it up! Congrats!!! I hope i could have been in your concerts and listed to the raw sound of Europe! But i just found you all months ago. Your music is... there are no words to describe it!!! \n~Joakim B. Nordurljósson~ \ni hope one day i can have a great band with original songs and sounds! 
Norum and Leven should be on a diet, they´re turning into pigs.
6 unlike. \nFans Bon Jovi? ;)
Horrible como todo lo que hicieron de 2004 en adelante... \nHorrible as everything they did from 2004 onwards ...
Alexandra owned that dance!! Nice to see the judges give it so much love too ;)
This was *LIT* - cannot wait to see how firey their Argentine Tango is gonna be (whenever they get it)
If they are shagging \nI definitely don't blame her 😂
I feel like that would've been even more powerful if it had a traditional paso song. The salsa feeling kinda threw me off, which is why i wanted to watch it some more. Wow!
This was of a quality not even seen in the final by all but a few of the winners.
Great British people, I am calling for you to vote for this amazing couple! As I can not do it myself from Czech republic, please keep amazing Gorka and fabulous Alexandra until the finals! And I am going to watch this ten more times.
After this I wanted to dance. I did...\n\nI danced against a door and now my head is aching. \nWhat is my life?
I think I have a weird obsession with this routine.. I keep creepingly coming back to watch it.. can't get over it.. and I know this may sound weird but I want them to date.. they are such a great looking pair... Shipping them so hard...
Alexandra as good as as pro - in 2 weeks !! Paso Doble and Alexandra made for each other
WOW!!! ........and only week 2!! Gorka.......you really hit the jack-pot when you were partnered with this girl!!!!
i sincerely hope that alexandra and gorka don't get the same treatment that natalie gumede and artem got a few years back. in my opinion, natalie has been the very best dancer to appear on strictly (with, or, without previous experience argument). alexandra could well equal the achievements of natalie. absolute pleasure to watch over and over again.
One of the best dances ive seen on strictly, loved it! They've got such amazing chemistry together and Gorka, be still my beating heart!! 😍 I thought no one could replace Aljaz as my number 1 strictly crush but Gorka's giving it a good go lol
SLAYYYY
YASSSS work alex!! best dance on strictly in a while
Oliver AndMiaVEVO\nOliver AndMiaVEVO\n1 second ago\nwhat is the last number of your like:\n1-Davood and Nadiya \n2-Mollie and AJ \n3-Chizzy and Pasha\n4-Gemma and Aljaz \n5-Rev Richard Cole and Dianne\n6-Susan and Kevin\n7-Charlotte and Brendan\n8-Alexandra and Gorka \n9-Aston and Janette\n0-Joe and Katya  \n\nLeave a comment telling me if you think this is a cool idea and who you got i cant wait to find out also keep dancing\nMia and Oliver vevo
She started of really good but her nerves kicked in you can see her legs shaking and a view steps missed but all in amazing for UK
We love Strictly and this year there are so many brilliant contestants
This is perhaps the only time I've thought that Jennifer Lopez song has ever sounded good, haha! A thrilling paso. There were a few rough spins and I wish that the walking transitions looked a bit more musical rather than rushed. Nonetheless, the 36 was definitely justified, in my view. Great choreo from Gorka and it really showed off Alexandra's grace, speed and power.\nOverall, I'm rooting for Alexandra. Despite (thankfully) the few idiotic bores further down in the comments section playing into misomelangyny and claiming she's 'arrogant' and 'up herself', she's a very talented, professional and unassuming entertainer that evidently not only dedicates herself to her craft but also – more importantly – enjoys it. I sincerely hope she gets into the final.
I couldnt keep my eyes of her.. her every move was so entertaining and beautiful as well as passionate.. the chemistry between the both was on another level in this performance
She dancing with her massa
Its just a lot of flicking around, kinda easy!
This felt like the first moment of the series.And in a frankly not too deep field this year,barring accidents, she's a finalist.I have to say I haven't quite warmed to her yet,but that's more about me with driven people.This was a delight by the way.Also I felt she was strangely undermarked last week.
This is one of the best dances I have seen on strictly. The song was just perfect too.. I like that they did the Spanish version. But I agree with what Darcy says, the way Alexandra expresses herself to the music is amazing to watch.
I genuinely can't believe the intensity she attacked this with and the difficult technique that she nailed - amazing.
Que arte♡
Who knew she could be this intense? I thought I would pass out after watching this dance
I've watched Strictly Come Dancing since it launched and no-one has ever danced a paso doble with such power and commitment. I just wanted to scream with power! OLE ALEXANDRA! If this was not week two, that would have been 40!
She is going to WIN this show
Yaaaaaaaas that was so fast!!!
Seriously undermarkef
I think that is a very good example of somebody who understands ballroom dancing and the little details of flamenco (paso doble). Very well executed by both.
They definitely saved the best till last. Fab-u-lous as Craig would say. Alexandra danced like a pro, and Gorka looks hot. Not my overall favourites, but one of them (I think it's hard to have a fave this early). It's a 10 from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the new Alesha Dixon!
Incredible! I usually lose interest during some of the dances, but this was such a dramatic and intense performance, perfectly executed, that I had to come and watch it on here again!
If thats how she preforms the Paso, I CANNOT Wait for her Tango and Argentinian Tango
Where the 40 at?

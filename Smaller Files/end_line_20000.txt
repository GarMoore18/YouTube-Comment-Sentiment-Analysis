I'm your biggest fan ever
Love you
Cool
solupugid or yellow jacket xD?
Coyotes girlfriend is called Meredith Joyce houghton (::::::
omg awesome!!!!!!!!
WHERE DA DINOSAURS \n\n\nAHHHHH
brave wilderness I dare you to get bit by a shark
Coyote and the crew are professionally trained. Never attempt to sing the Jurassic park theme song yourself!
Peter thanks for having me on, this was a lot of fun and of course it was a pleasure singing with you! You're the man - Ant
THAT. WAS. INCREDIBLY. AMAZING!!!!! Keep going guys! !! Big love from Italy! !!!!♥♥♥
Omg you where on the news in the Netherlands
@PeterHollens, this was fantastic! @Pentatonix was the best! You won!
Please, please, please do Empty chairs at empty tables!
Would love if you did a cover of an Irish Folk song called One I love
This was so fun to watch! I hope you do more of these! Never thought I'd Hear Peter Hollens singing country like that
So many parodies in one video!!!! lol
How can you sing literally everything!
I'm not a fan of this song but this was AWESOME
super cool and creative. The fact that PTX and Skyrim are their own genres is perfection! :)
wait what this is a rap battle?
Could you possibly sing Siuil a Run?
Apparently, Skyrim is now a genre
Well well well ... What can i say ? Incredible, like always. \nDo you know what would be incredible too ? Singing Johanna or Pretty Women from the movie Sweeney Todd, i think it would be great.\nPlease, do it ... please
Because frank sinatra is a genre
when did Pentatonix become a genre?
wow opera and broadway was amazing!! The whole video I couldn't do anything else but smile!
All the versions were great, but the Pentatonix-version was the best for me. :)
Well that was incredibly entertaining
Country was my favourite! Shout out to Pentatonix, RIP Avi...
Okay, but what's that Van Morrison-thing?! It does sound nothing like him ...
That was amazing! Any chance we could get a full country version with both of you?
This is amazing 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 Want to listen over and over again 😊🙏🙏🙏❤\nThank you for all wonderful music and I love to listen ☺☺☺
awesome, i give like, and subscribe
If the Sinantra part was a full version, I'd totally want it
I need a full version of the song as Broadway. That was amazing
I love this idea of changing genres and battling!  REALLY hope to see more of these types of videos soon!  Thoroughly enjoyed it <3
Metal has won, and it was not even close ...
Please collaborate again! I've watched this I don't know how many times!
i persinaly dont like how much you took from nicepeter's ERB it feels tacked on
Clearly the winner was us, the viewers.
Hey Peter,\n  I've just recently found you and you are absolutely so talented. God has absolutely blessed you with a gift. Could you do the once upon a time musical episode music. But anything Is fine. Can't wait until ur next video!
I was amused the whole way through.
I'm so proud to see another Eugene YouTuber KILLIN' it!! Do a mix of Britney/Christina songs.
I loved country style I have to say!  <3
Lol 😂😂😂
figut spinerr
Amazing!
Chant is the coolest

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, I CANT BREATH!
This was... an experience...?\nVery good.
I have a request!!! Believe it or not, I would love to hear you sing Billy Joel's Downeaster Alexa. Especially after hearing you do the chanting style, I think it would great. :) PS: I lol'd at the skyrim part.
Please do more things in an opera voice! I love the way it sounded, and I need more of it in my life.
Pentatonix is officially a genre.
please do full cover of shape of you country version 😫😫
OH MY GOD! PTX, Polka, Eric Whitacre, this has everything!! IT WAS AWESOME!!!!
PENTATONIXXXXXXX WONNNNNN!!! 😍😍😍 Best part of the whole thing, I just about died!!!! 😱😱👻👻
Oh my gosh I love it!!! ❤❤❤
Please make more like this!!!! Try
Peter.\nFor everyone's sake.\nThrow. Away. The spidget finner.\n\nAlso nice work, keep it up
lol\nthe pentatonix one got me good xD
Omg this was amazing!!!! Especially the PTX part
The country is good
More of these please!!!
I loved this! I think this is my favorite collaboration/mash-up so far.
So differences in genre come down to pace and timing. Interesting.
I loved this!! This was great, I mean I loved every bit.
Y'all are good
The country one killed me!! So funny.
That was EPIC!! Great job guys 😎

This  song remind me Prison Break (some people know why ) ;)
I'm usually not into his music but I love this song. Only thing I don't like about it is the transitions from the verse to the chorus. It's very sloppy. Other then that the song is great!
It's a good song. My future wife will like it too.
i hope this beat the Taylor swift shit...😍
This song reminds me of the music era in 2011
this song is very awesome and zayn voice from heaven

😍😍😍😍, what eyelashes are you wearing ?
Jamie, your hair looks great!
YOU LOOK FREAKING INCREDIBLE YOU ANGEL
WHERE ARE YOUR PORES?!?!
I just absolutely love watching you! So beautiful and real!
I don't even have to watch this video to tell you if it's worth it. Girl is that description a joke? 😹😹😹 HELL MF YES IT IS WORTH IT!
My goodness, your skin looks AMAZING! This line is definitely something that will have to go on my wishlist <3
YOU'RE A GODDESS 😍
Im in love with ur accent new subbie alert 🚨
Your face/skin looks amazing your makeup looks amazing as well beautiful.
I didn't want to buy any of this until I saw this video.. the foundation looks Amazing 😍
Totally shocked that there's only ONE lippie!
Amazing video !!! I just subscribed!!! I've been watching YouTube for years and never came across your videos before  .. I'm Canadian and actually living in Glasgow at the moment with my Scottish hubby 😊. So love you even more that you're Scottish! 😉👌🏻Have fun wedding dress shopping!!! X\nI'm definitely going to Harvey Nic's tomorrow in Edinburgh so spend all my money on Fenty haha
Ok. So i hadnt heard anything at all about this collection and Im not particularly a huge fan of Rihanna.  But OMG! you look gorgeous. When i saw the thumbnail i clicked on it immediately because i had to know what was on your face. You look so breath taking. Also i think you look so glowy and it made me laugh that you said you werent used to being so matte. Lol but anyways you look amazing.
Does anyone know if the foundation would be any good for dry skin??? The struggle is so real finding a foundation that works with my crusty ass face ( I have good skin care I just have dry skin :( )
Why does she look different in the thumbnail ¿ Not saying it in a bad way she's absolutely beautiful but I'm just curious 🤷🏻‍♀️💗
Jamie do you have a tutorial with makeup for humid weather?
can't stop looking at your dingly earring. The mixture of earrings and piercings you have with your hair looks so fucking good. I want a dingly earring
I think everything looks great on you!! I saw sooo many people gathered around the Fenty Beauty display at Sephora today so I havent gotten a chance to browse it yet. You've got me excited to try it!!! You look beautiful❤❤
This is the best I have ever seen your skin! It looks so beautiful!
I think this is a nice brand and the foundation is great for people who like/prefer matte finish. You just rock the dewy look, Jamie!! Im the same way! I love my oils, my natural/satin/dewy finishes and i have been loving Cover Fx illuminating setting mist😍 you should try it. Love the highlighter, i bought trophy wife today. Gonna use it as eyeshadow. Thanks for this review!
I REALLY love this look on you!
JAAAMIIIEEE you look STUNNING! The lipgloss is gorgeous on you! Also your skin is amazing right now.
New subscriber - love how this looks on your skin.  It looks dewy and flawless even though it sounds like it feels otherwise.  I've watched a couple of other reviews of the products and that's how I found you.  That seems to be a commonality.  What it feels like vs what it looks like are two different things though the matte feeling wasn't described as bad.  It sounds great for oily or combo skin but mine is super dry so I'm thinking there is no way it will work on me.
How did I miss this 😍😍😍
Your skin...holy shit 😍😫 it is as plump and clear as an angels bum!!
Okay I may have to splurge on this line..maybe after my baby gets here because I'm just not feeling myself right now, despite all the makeup I have 😕 But this look looks great on you!! No creasing, nothing! Can't wait to see how it's worn! ❤❤
One of the best face looks you've done in my opinion 🙌🏽🙌🏽 you always look beautiful but the blends are so nice and natural! Enough bronzer blush everything so pretty! 😚😚😚💅🏽💅🏽💅🏽
This is honestly the best your skin has ever looked! It always looks good, but looks amazing here! Love the lip look way better than a liquid lip - looks like your natural lips but better. Also the gold higlighter looks crazy wearable and gorgeous.
why have I never found you before now 😩 so genuine and unreal!!!
Skin looks gorgeous i think! Loved this review
Jamie💛💖💛,\n\nI absolutely LOVE this makeup on your skin!! You do not look too matte and to me anyways , you look fresh faced and a little dewey😗\n\nI bought the sticks from Sephora. They are coming today and I am super exfit3d to try them!!💖💖. Brianna is my woman crush so it's a bonus that I get to support $$ her and also support my own love of makeup at the same time!! Lol
I bought my shade online and it's about 70 shades too light. Lesson learnt: listen to Jamie and don't buy online 😂
See with the contour sticks do they have warmer ones? I use the smashbox ones still (throwback!) and I use a more cool toned one to contour, then I highlight (then I would cream blush if I used it), but then I blend my warmer shade where I would normally bronze and blend it a little further down or upward on my cheekbones and it acts as a bronzer rather than a contour stick. Don't know if you'll even see this but just thought it would help if you did want to utilise one as a cream bronzer.
Anyone sick of eyeshadow and eyeshadow looks? I sure am, glad Rihanna didn't make that her release's focus
I'm a huge fan of your make-up looks, but this one is the best I've ever seen on you. Your skin is flawless and the lipgloss looks stunning on you and suits you a million times more than anything I've ever seen you wear on your lips. You should def' wear the foundation n highlighters again and the lipgloss is the biggest keeper xoxo
Your make up looks stunning here! You look beautiful, love your hair like this too xx
I love this !!!!!! I'm not a big fan of gold highlight because I feel it makes me look yellow toned or sort of washed out ? But this is amazing ' 🙌🏼
I love that the foundation is matte! Hopefully someone in New Zealand will stock it 🤞🏼I'm very keen to try. Thanks Jamie, love your videos as always x
I'm not a matte foundation fan for my skin either but your skin is looking really gorgeous so it's inspiring me to try it out! And I am really liking how natural it's looking. That yellow highlighter may be too much for my pale ass skin but it's surprisingly wearing really nice on you! Thanks for sharing!
I LOVE YOUR HAIR LIKE THIS GIRL!! <3 <3 ALSOO your skin is super nice!!  I thought your lashes were lash extensions you apply them so flippin well!! <3 #snapfam
I'm so excited to get my Fenty products!!
I freaking love ur accent!!! I've followed you on ig but never youtube idk why (until today) I can't wait to binge watch ur vids after this vid 💕💕
OOOOOO I know you said you're not crazy about the matte-ness of it but OOO BOY it still looks pretty dewy and natural/glowy to me!!! It looks amazing I'm HYPE
The highlight looks gorgeous on you layered with the two different shades.
This look is so wonderful on you! Different from your usual, but STUNNING! Fenty looks good on you ;)
I uploaded a vid on the foundation too it really is amazing😍😍
Looks stunning on you, I think the color and texture is just right
You're so beautiful!!😍
The Macy's ad was amazing.....
I think her coming out with face products makes sense. She's always had the most beautiful skin!!
Crikey that's A LOT of make up... how do you even move your face?
What is the highlighting brush you used please? LOVE the video! xxx
Skin looks sooo amazing! I just made my first beauty/skin care video if anyone would like to check if out!
I love the way this looks! Your skin literally looks like skin!
Your skin is perfection. You don't need foundation.
If you haven't chosen a photographer yet for your wedding you should check out Angie B Photography - she's based out of Perth. She's an amazing person and her work is stunning! She's won Scottish Wedding Photographer of the year too! https://www.angieb.co.uk/
so pleased to hear another scottish accent wee pleasant surprise
I love it on your skin even though you love more glowy finish, it is beautiful and I can't wait for more Fenty Beauty
Beautiful as always!! 💕 What lashes are you wearing?
You look absolutely beautiful !!!! You're video is great had such a blast watching it every informative and straight to the point 👍🏽👍🏽
Has anyone with oily skin tried this foundation- if so how long wearing was it??
Her shade is whaaat??? Can't understand her accent
My gosh, every time I watch your tutorials I'm always taken by how incredibly beautiful you are. Your eyes are stunning!! Great review btw, it helped me decide so much!
Jamie you look AMAZING! Love this look ❤️
ITS ALL SO BEAUTIFUL. your skin looks flawless!
I loved the foundation and everything before you used the MAC bronzer :( It turned you really orange. Maybe it looked different in person, but otherwise I love how the Fenty products made your skin look!
I think this makeup looks SO STUNNING on you!! sooo natural, looks nice for every day sorta thing since I know you like more full glam normally.. I think your skin looks super dewy and fresh and healthy, I'm digging this! <3
What color foundation did you use? Sorry if I missed it😬😣
this look is so good for you, you look so healthy and chic
I reckon you should give it a go without the MAC bronzer next time, the whole look would/will look amazing! The cream contour with highlighter on top -  YASSSSS.  \nX
Jamie!! why are you so perfect! Glowy is everything, BUT Matte looks good on you too!
Your skin looks amazeeeeee on this amazing love it
You are one of my favorite Youtubers to watch! You seem so genuine and I honestly love your accent. Also, you're beautiful! 💕
You look a state, so probably not.
Why have I only just found your channel!? I see you everywhere haha, you're so down to earth! :)
What foundation color is this?
Tattoos , no just NO
More videos like this, they know so much bout footy just listening to them talk is making me better lmao
i think Paul Scholes has to be in that team....and barnes over giggs in my opinion. Best partner for Shearer for me is Sheringham
Giggs is the most overrated player in PL history. Pires>Giggs easily
Why is the BBC accepting the Sky/Murdoch propaganda that there was no football before the 'premier' league?
I love the analysis top notch
Stam, Okocha, and Zola left out?
No Scholes, Vieira or Keane. Ok?
WHAT ABOUT VAN PERSIE!!!!!!! His first touch was incredible and his skill was unbelievable. The goals he scored....... Remember his header when he won 5-1 against Spain??
Since this is only a hypothetical midfield,  Gerrard and Lampard defo
Yeah right, why was Shearer in this discussion? I think we already knew the outcome and I agree with Henry Shearer duo.\nBut it's kinda funny to see him here. lol.
Where is Silva??? A true magician with the ball, the most underrated player in the Premier, he is simply superb week in week out.
How can we not have Scholes!!
I would have to separate Gerrard and Lampand. Take Lampand out and put in Scholes or Virera. I would put Scholes in.
Could you do a what would happen if the internet went down for an hour video?
this was depressing. also people aren't going to search about good things because they don't need help with those
Hahah, it says absolutley.. erm..  **Backs out of comments slowly** 💨

I use incognito all the time, I just tell people it works faster.

Hmmm...\n*D E L E T E  N O W*
lol. Many rich rappers use the N word and the B word , and no one cares. Seems like it's ok only if the caviar left does it. Maybe the statistics come from the edgy kids looking for those songs.\nAfter what people say about google search engine these days, I won't trust their statistics.
and this is why the incognito tab has been created...
My search history says that I should be behind bars and should never be released
This makes me feel so much more normal. xD
Can you do the science of Accutane?
Please please please tell me how the scientists came to know haw does milkyway galaxy ,our galaxy,looks like? how do they took its photo please tell me please
Apparently I'm the only idiot here that uses incognito mode.

Do a video about diets for kids
I've searched the N-word before and like jokes that use it, At least for me it had nothing to do with racism.
How do girls use condoms?
Mine is just filled with anime (not weird type) and memes lmao
My search history is clean... what does that say about me?
Mine makes people question my sexuality
It says I mostly watch YouTube.
GARBAGE.
hey, really good job, but you speak so fast ! haha
My search history. Porn, porn, porn, 4chan, 4chan, porn you get the point.
I google a lot about my period.\nI mean they say pain is normal but i don't think I'm meant to be laying on the floor for hours screaming in agony despite having taken specially prescribed pills to stop cramps.\nI also miss most of my periods.
Looks at friends history.\nRoblox p00rn\nHenta1\nWhat is search history?\nP0rn
u mean no one other than American s are using internet..... u r saying the world as america..... then where we from mars???
Google also never auto completes a pornstars name.
Why do we have a gut feeling?
That i have a problem with memes.
I've made it so Google doesn't track my search history. 9/10 times I'm using incognito mode. I make it a habit to use Tor, Edge, or maybe Chrome on Bluestacks to switch things up everyone once in a while. And Ghostery is enabled whenever I use Chrome. Now no one will discover just how much time I spend on YouTube.
Thank God for the Incognito Tab!
My last words will be Delete my... Internet search history.

lol, racism is not as alive as you would think. To proclaim the search increase for the n word as yes this correlates to racism rather than the great meme wars, shows how little understanding of the subject you actually know. \n\n Let the memes be with you.

Hmmmm\n*looks up search history*\nwww.thepiratebay.org\nwww.kickasstorrents.se\ngoogle: Best torrent VPN\nHmmmmm, wonder what I do...
And if you have no search history, its pretty obvious what WAS there
This video should be called What your search history says about you (BY YOU WE MEAN AMERICANS)?
That I'm a total weirdo
It's important to keep in mind that just because we search for something, doesn't mean it's the truth about us. For example, I don't think people regret having their kids just because they type that search term. Perhaps someone is having doubt and searches the Internet for like-minded people just to feel re-assured that it is OK to have those doubts.
*Puts John Cena as my screen saver* what search history?
How many people just clicked on this to leave a snarky comment??
My search history just makes me seem like a homicidal food enthusiast.
ya know that there is something called incognito mode right by just Shift+Ctrl+N
*searches something with the word nigger just to troll google*
So now you assholes are getting political about things? Just stop. Go back to the way you used to be! I'm not liking this new trend you are trying to follow.

Quando hai skriniar al fanta e nel momento in cui prende la traversa partono bestemmie in loop
Grande inter...ma anche contro una grande spal secondo me l'Inter quest'anno tornerà in Champions più forte che mai #AMALA #FORZAINTER
grande inter....we will back to champion league
Ho l'impressione che gli arbitri sapendo di avere le spalle coperte dal VAR, siano molto meno attenti che prima. Il fallo che ha originato il rigore per l'Inter era all'interno dell'area di almeno mezzo metro, è possibile che tra arbitro, guardalinee e assistente di porta abbiano dovuto ricorrere a un ausilio tecnologico e nessuno sia stato in grado di decidere?
#forzaInter #fcim #amala ,#champ19ne
I loved your video. I think very honest so thank you very much #samelessfenty
omg we have the same skin color, I took the 360 ! :)
Thanks for the opportunity to win this beautiful makeup! Can't justify spending this kind of money right now so again, thanks!! <3 <3 <3
Looks real good on you Maya.
You are gorgeous inside and out!!!
I typically shy away from foundation, but I will use BB Creams. They still feel a bit heavy for me since I only want thin coverage, so I'm really drawn to this product and I love how it gives the natural bronzy look.
Been watching your channel since forever so I know this is a first for you. Loooove your review and how honest it is...as all your videos are normally, lol.
My dream for my sweet 16 in October😍 Don't wanna ask my parents cause it's so expensive don't wanna waste their hard earned coin😅 But omg 😍 I'm exactly your shade and I love to see another brown girl teaching me to rock makeup like you. Beautiful personality ! -love from the island of Trinidad,West Indies,Caribbean🇹🇹❤️

Nunes does not deserve the win
Hobbie lawler 😂😂😂
RDS vs Hobbie Lawler.
Fook you UFC How The hell Valentina Lost the fight. fook u
Valentina clearly won that fight! if you think otherwise, please hang yourself
People here act like Valentina won,i was rooting for Valentina but JEEESUS,if you want the belt you have to FIGHT,she threw 50 punches in the whole match,2 of them landed to no effect,no pressure,just waiting....If Amanda would have played the counter game Valentina would have literally thrown NO PUNCHES....Im dissapointed in Valentina after all that shit talkin' and shit i would have expected to actually fight for it...and now she acts like she was robbed....This kind of fights really expose fighters like Valentina who just wait for a mistake....i understand the counter strike game trust me but man.....she literally did NOTHING in this fight
Where's Dana so he can say he has it 2-2 going into the 5th round ?
Yeah that Hobbie Lawler fight is the one to make. His hlord hesus Christ and saviour wants that fight.
Valentina #1.   FUCKKKK YOUUUU BİTCHHHHHHH AMENDA NUNES
First Cejudo fight and pressor I've seen. New found respect for his skills and his respectful attitude. Looked a lot like Conor's wide karate in / out bouncing style stance and extended arm - pawing at his opponent. Not a McGregor fan by any stretch of the imagination, just an observation.
Gustafsson admitted that he didn't do enough to take the belt from Bonesjones, even though he thinks he won the fight on points. Valentina needs to take the obvious hint, don't leave it up to the judges. To be the champ not only do you have to beat the champ, you have to rip the champs head off!
I watched the fight back in silence with a pen and scorecard. I gave Nunes rounds 1,3 and 5 under the current point scoring system. Amanda won, but the whole system is wrong and limited; needs a radical overhaul.
Nunes keep calling herself Lioness (female lion) but she keeps using Lion (male) image
Thats what happens when youre openly gay, you get pushed to stay on top just because of horrible propaganda
Robbed or not..dont leave it in the hands of the judges..
I wont lie nunes got the win but if it was five rounds she would have hassed and and been wrecked
I love how ppl are saying Valentina won, you dummies nobody won, they gave it to Nunes based on simple technicality, she just moved more at the end but both fighters didn't do shit the whole time I was actually thinking my online feed was buffering or something at one point cuz they were just like standing still, imo, they both lost, I would have sent a message to both fighters and other fighters in UFC and gave a decision of No Contest, both losers, you don't train for months and have all these people pay to get in and pay to watch it on TV and than after all the build up just look at each other and bounce around touching each other's gloves the odd time for 15 mins, fuck this fight, UFC needs to change is rules, in a case like this with no clear winner, have 3 fuckin bonus rounds, if still nothing, 3 more, eventually someone will lose clearly.
A MAN NUNES , what a gutless monstrosity...Dudes like that, shouldn't be around! The UFC should force him to fight CYBORG with Herb To the death Dean reffing that shit!!!!
UFC What are the fight bonus ?????????????????????????????????????
Cejudo is a stand up guy, and a legitimate badass. His striking is getting so much better!  He will be ready for DJ soon.
Did Henry just say he uses brute strength? ...uuuu ok ..u see brute strength I see brute strength bro. You 5ft 0 95lb man
Nunes vs shevchenko\n\nThe battle of grammar
Shevchenko needs to be humble in loss you fought her before you knew what you had to do counter punch don't cut it it was close but I think judges was right
Amanda is a good person
Lets agree here amanda was afraid to lose the belt n therefore fought the way she did n valentina the same onli cuz she was afraid of losing the oppurtunity. Alot of these champions r fightimg too safe they need to go bak to wat got them there in the first place
when do we get the drug test results
you can't win the belt if you avoid fighting
lol Nunes can either go 2 rounds and blast people then gas out or go 5 rounds and do nothing.
nunez said she didn't want tte ko or sub  she wanted to show she could go 5 rds 25 mins  BULLSHIT who wouldn't ko an opponent  if possible she sounds stupid
Bought women fought bad as fuck. Don't be bitching about judges now, you both lost.
Only i couldn't listen that stupid monkey nunes? Her face looks like my shit
Nunes lost this fight 100% Valentina should be champion!
Idk. I had it a draw but then Nunes got that take down at the end. Lets do it again! Trilogy!
why do people hate amanda so much? did she kick a kitten or something?
The commentary was fucking gold during this event.
Valentina didn't win, nor did Nunes. It was a DRAW and there needs to be a 3rd fight. Neither fighter did enough to win or even win a round decisively. Nunes' take down was nothing, it wasnt clean and she did no damage with it. It's a major floor of mma that take downs are given props like this. If you try a take down and can't land it clean or do any damage with it, that should go against you in the judging if anything!
Nunes needs to go up in weight and get a shot at Conor's belt, he deserves it👍
Aaaaaand everyone hates nunes
Nunes looks like a teenage boy.
Just a bit of data for reference ( Fight Metric stats )\n\nSignificant Strikes ( Nunes )\n86 of 176 ( 48% )\nRd 1 25 of 43 ( 58% ) \nRd 2 16 of 29 ( 55% )\nRd 3 17 of 47 ( 36% )\nRd 4 24 of 42 ( 57% )\nRd 5 4 of 15 ( 26% ) \nTakedowns - 2,  ( Rd1, Rd5 ) 2 of 8  - 25%\n\nSignificant Strikes ( Shevchenko )\n72 of 194 ( 37% )\nRd 1 11 of 31 ( 35% )\nRd 2 12 of 37 ( 32% )\nRd 3 15 of 44 ( 34% )\nRd 4 20 of 50 ( 40% )\nRd 5 14 of 32 ( 43% )\nTakedowns - 0,   0 of 1 - 0%
Valentina won that fight, it was not close, Valentina landed way more puchnes and kicks.\nAnd only in the last round 5 Nunes did take down, at on the grond Valentina did even more punch in the face of Nunes
NUNES LOST BECAUSE SHE WAS A LESBO, NOT BLACK!
#40 on trending, just behind the make up idiots and cup cakers,\n i
big respez to cejudo, would love to see him fight sergio pettis for number 1 contender
Sorry Amanda. We would be more impressed with a finish than going 5 rounds. It's supposed to be the Ultimate FIGHTING championship, not the Ultimate Endurance Championship.
Cejudo carries himself like a champ. Its a shame he's in the same division as mighty mouse
Parabéns Amanda!
another boring fight card!!!
2-0
The dislike tho..... keep going guys....
Gj ufc for robbing valentina
I wanna see Hafael Vs Huthless Hobbie
Rematch again shev is better than nunes
Blasphemy
FUCKING ENGLISH    lol
A MAN DUH NUNES
Hobbie Lawler! 😂
Why so many dislikes??....
Amanda  No monster drink  Nunes.
Feeling happy for Henry Cejudo, good stuff!
Dude.....I cant remember ever watching a 125 lber post fight, but i'm liking Cejudo more and more. His style is entertaining af, he should technically be 2-0 since losing to DJ, and fighting for the title next against the plague.
Also i am sure polish jenchenchik would get fucked by shevchenko
Actually believe it or not Nunes won the fight, the punchings exchanges were positive for her the 2 first rounds. Valentina got more overall. Nunes' plan was to weaken that right leg from Valentina for the 4 rounds and then secure the win with a takedown in the last one. The standing fight was really close tho, valentina shown more combinations and techniques but most of them were not significatnt/strong ones. If Nunes didnt performed the takedown on the last round she would have lost. The last round was very positive in the standing game for Shevchenko.\n\nNunes clearly managed the octagon and distance for the entire fight, and thats a fact. Valentina knew Nunes was abusing her leg with low kicks and did practically nothing about it.
shut up nunes you lost
I think a reasonable person could see how either fighter could have been given the decision.   Valentina herself only thinks she won 3 rounds, so if the judges disagreed with her on only one round then she lost.  My assessment is that Amanda clearly won rounds 1 and 5, while Valentina won round 4, so the debate is who won rounds 2 and 3.  Valentina, I thought was too defensive and although she has quicker hands, she was only waiting to counter, problem is Amanda knew it, so Amanda was the aggressor but she was using low kicks and kicks to the abdomen, making it difficult for Valentina to counter and limited her scoring opportunities.  Because Amanda was the aggressor and the judges are suppose to award the aggressor, since they are bringing the fight, that's was the key reason Amanda won.  You can play it safe like Valentina, be defensive and only plan to score by countering the whole night, but don't be surprise when you lose, since the only fighter I've seen to have success with that strategy in title fights is Mayweather, but unfortunately Valentina is not Mayweather.  Lastly, I suspect Valentina was gun shy after feeling Amanda power in the first fight, since that's the only reason I can think of that would cause her not to let her hands go, when her hands are clearly quicker that Amanda's.
Valentina beat herself with a stupid fight plan.  She used the same passive fight plan she used on holly but this just in, Amanda saw that fight.  Valentina didn't want to take risk so all Amanda had to do was be the aggressor in each round knowing since close rounds go to the aggressor.  Amanda plan was to simply out point valentina unlike her other fights were she goes for the ko, thats why she was smiling in between rounds because she knew she was winning.  She won the fights with those leg kicks, kicks to the abdomen and those take downs in round 5, while valentina was sitting there waiting to counter, something she didn't get to do much
Valentina didn't do shit this fight, get over it, she deserved the L
Round 1 Nunes\nRound 2 Valentina\nRound 3 Nunes\nRound 4 Valentina\nRound 5 Nunes\nWatch it again. I'm not a Nunes fan but that fucking bitch won fair. Valentina did more damage, Nunes scored more points.
Fuck your retarded decision... nunes lost... the fuck is this ? You should fire those retarded so called judges asap... what the fuck did they judge ?? They clearly are fucking blind bats
Wanna take the belt from a champ? Win decisively. Wanna keep your belt? Win decisively.
As bad as when Condit ran from diaz
For all you Valentine fans stop crying. This was a boring fight!!! Shavchenko fought like a little girl. To be a champion you have to beat the champion. Not by points but the head off. Nunes is the champ. She stood her ground.
sorry but Nunes really not convince me in this fight she do nothing  and everything she say in the post fight dont make sense Oo , in my book Valentina win the fight  but is look she dont make enough to win the belt
Valentina was frightened, she did not do the necessary to be champion, she talked too much and did nothing, robbery would be to get a champ doing nothing
why hate on nunes, she had a job to do and did it, the UFC fucked up not her
melendez needs to retire or something... he doesn't care for fighting anymore it seems... if you're a strikeforce fan... this isn't the same melendez at all.
Look at shevchenkos head looks like she stuck it in a beehive !She says Amanda didn't hurt her but did she ever really hurt Amanda?Amanda kinda Floyd mayweathered Valentina and then took her down to seal the deal no robbery close fight but no robbery
Shevchenko is robbed
Valentina won that fight!
That was some bullshit for real that the crooked judges gave Amanda Nunes the win over Valentina Shevchenko! They did her dirty right there. I finished watching the fight just now. Valentina clearly won that fight and should be the next champion. Valentina gave the most connected striking in each round than Amanda did towards Valentina. Valentina stopped one of Amanda's takedowns, successfully gotten out of one of her traps on the ground in the last round, with exception for the last takedown which Amanda didn't hardly do anything when she was on top of her. No submission or ground pounding from Amanda...while Valentina on her back was striking her really well. I don't blame her for being angry about the decision and filing a appeal for a third fight. For over a year now, these judges would make decisions over fights screwing these fighters of their win when it was obvious they scored the fight in each round incorrectly and unfairly. I don't what drugs these judges were on or what they got against Valentina, but they are wrong for making that decision. Sorry. They need to hire new judges who are experienced in judging these fights. That's just how I feel. 😠 It's time for a *Trilogy* ☺
#AndStill baby!
#NunesFakeChampion What a shame!!! 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼💩💩
Robbery, give her a rematch
Rematch!
Nunes won at best 2 rounds... Robbed simply based on the fact Nunes did get a takedown but did ZERO damage with it and actually received damage from getting hit from the bottom. Nunes was gifted this decision for sure.
Saltchenko fans make me so happy. Ya girl lost. Cry some more.
47-47 if you include the point which should have been deducted
I though that Shevchenko won the fight, I gave Nunes the 1st round then Shevchenko the 2nd, 3rd and 4th round and then Nunes the 5th, I like both fighters but seriously when Shevchenko lost it didn't really bother me as I like both fighters but I lost a serious amount of respect to Shevchenko because all she did was bitched at the end of the fight, other fighters are humble in defeat and she didn't even thank the the crowd, thank Nunes and said it was a really tough fight, all she did was bitched and said the judges are terrible and I won easily. Although I thought Shevchenko won, I lost a lot of respect to her
Bout scores:\n\nJohnson x Martins (8/10)\nHenrique x Bhullar (2/10)\n\nClarke x White (8/10)\nTucker x Glenn (4/10)\nMoras x Evans (5/10)\nMcMann x Vieira (5/10)\n\nStephens x Melendez (5/10)\nLatifi x Pedro (2/10)\nCejudo x Reis (8/10)\nMagny x Anjos (6/10)\nNunes x Shevshen (2/10)
Valentina didn't show the fight of champion. Its not enough!
Nunes was 1-0 up in terms of their rivalry.she had less to lose. Even if nunes lost, it would have been a draw so she really just had to control the fight & avoid major damage.Valentina lost her chance. E.g Conor vs Nate... conor came back and won making it a draw.
How Valentina lost this fight I'll never know...she out struck Nunes....like Dana White always said never leave it in the judges hands.
I don't hate Amanda for this it's the judges fault absolutely disgusting obviously picking nunes because she black & a lesbian it's this generations wet dream me & shevchenko would gun all you antifa black lives matter down with explosive rounds then me & shevchenko will fornicate for hours on end
Valentina lost you idiots because to take a title away from a champion you have to put on a convincing performance.  If you don't then the champion always get the benefit of the doubt in situations like these.  If she actually went for it and fought instead of engaging in a sparring session the whole fight then it would be a different story.
Valentina, never leave it in the hands of the judges. To win a title fight you need to knock out or submit your opponent. You did not do that so stop whining!!!!
Greatest fighter is only Valentina...love u
Niel magney beat Kevin gastelum a guy who is exstremely talented and gave woodley split. And look what RDA did to him. I know mma math dosent work that way but still. RDA at WW is pretty damn impresive in POST USADA era.
Sue their ass,Valentina,fuck UFC,mafia scum!
How did schevschenko win? Amanda was the one constantly coming forward and she was backing up the whole fight. At some point the crowd was even boing. It was because of her.
Mad respect for Danny
Isit me our did mahrez look fumin and swear he said summin to kante and that guy pulled him away lol

Please put more effort into these videos and take more footage of the opposition, especially when big clubs like Chelsea are in town. That will bring you more views. I'm a Chelsea fan and I was looking forward to the video. It is really disappointing.
@LCFC. Hello, I think your video's length might be off... If you ever need some sound or background music just hmu or go to youtube com/XimerTracks
8k views on trending? Seems legit
where is iborra?

Bono singing Shooting off my mouth, that's another great thing about me with a knowing smile. Nice one U2.
It´s funny to see here some comments. The song is tuned Half Step Down, like many other U2 songs, like many other songs of great rock bands ie Guns &Roses. That doesn´t mean Bono can´t reach high notes, this is meaning that for the first time and since they are touring is better to preserve his voice. On the other hand Bono has a little craspy voice here, since he is suffering a lot with air conditioning so anytime he flyes has the same little problem... he also has some allergy in dry cities or cities near the dessert (like California). Again that doesn´t mean he´s not able to sing because being older, but because is human. And finally I think this is a great U2 pop song, typical heavy riff based on chord progressions and Edge signature delay... as much as I hear this song the more I like it!
every u2 songs alway better  in live version than recording version version.. always..
What a beautiful pop song. Shows once again why U2 are the modern day Beatles.
This version sounds so good. Liked it when the whole audience stood up for the legends.
Really like the simplicity.
I'll definitely buy this album! U2 is the best!
REALLY hated this song the first time I heard it. It takes repeated listens to appreciate it...kind of like all of their music from the last 20 years.
This song concerned me at first but it's really growing on me especially performed down a half step
Brilliant from the lads
God!! U2!!
brilliant love the edge singing his bit
I loved this song right away when I heard it the other day ❤
Larry's drumming is superb as always especially in the chorus
Wow! The Edge has an amazing voice!
Cool.
One, one word brilliant.
many bad reviews but 4k likes vs 125 deslikes ;) speak for itself ;)
U2
That voice.
U2!
U2 in best form Thank You ,.... and Thank You Mr.Fallon
ARE THESE PEOPLE STILL IMPOTENT. MAYBE IN THEIR OWN BEDS. IF THEY CANT GET IT UP HOW CAN THEY WRITE GOOD SONGS.
Sounds like a bunch of drowning cats!!!
the verse is better than chorus xD
our U2 will be never unplugged of life a great group
Still sounding as great as ever
The only interesting part of the song is the bridge
like  the simplicity of the chorus..classic  Bono
I'm no U2 hater or something, but this is a really mediocre performance of a really mediocre song.
They need to work with a producer who will push them/quality control them - this is not going in the time capsule.
tooo poppy shit
That opening chord reminds me of the opening chord to 'it's a Hard Days Night' by the Beatles
The musicianship is undeniable but the song doesn't have any punch.
not sure if Larry could look less enthusiastic haha. i think he's had enough.
The Edge sings like an Angel
total tripe the bass player says it all with his facial expressions totally boring
Certainly not their best. Extremely catchy but too repetitive and bland. Lacks depth and ideas. Very weak. Blackout much better. Hopefully SOE makes up for this. Still love U2 though. Croke park was the best.
At 1:34 when the verse riff suddenly kicks back quickly off the chorus..that's the best thing
This won't even make the top 100
So, So, SO MUCH better than that awful studio version!!! Still not their best work, but I would actually buy this version.
This live version sounds way better than the bubblegum coldplayish release
I felt like I was watching a u2 tribute band.
Was driving my car when heard a song and thought this is U2... now I've broken the reply button.
I like the song, but they should add a lot more power to bass and drums when they play it live. The DJ version had the crowd going the first time they heard it.
3:14 Edge outbonoing Bono
In this times we need the real and transgressor U2 not this
Saw them play this song last night in Indianapolis.
Their voices are out of this world but I can call them Queen #2
Jimmy at the end says call your DJ? WTF!
The left guitarist wasn't playing what the sound was most of the time
So, I'm a huge U2 fan. I've loved basically everything they've ever done. However, I  think that the arrangement is ruining the song. There is a video of KYGO performing a remix of this from last year - the song is the same, the lyrics are a bit different. It's 1000 betters, in my opinion. - To me, this arrangement seems very unfocused, very off..and this performance was even more so.
it looks that if you don't like it.. you are not suppose.. to think.. or say why... mm.. sorry u2.. your good days are over.. u2 should retire.
GREAT SONG, AMAZING ALBUM!!!

Love u2. Hopefully meet them in indonesia..singapore..or china
Oh man, they look real old. That's ok, they still have years to catch up to the Rolling Stones
Masterful lyrics, awful song...how can it be?
Despretensiosamente YBTAM conquista  o meu coração.
me gusta
I love u2 my favourite ever band but how can this be the lead single off a new album, it's so average! Like a album filler. What's going on?
AWESOME! I already recorded a guitar cover of this song on my channel!
Mesmo com o tom modificado, ficou foda ao vivo.
Oui!!.
Diganme si esto no es mucho mejor que la porqueria de cancion de Despacito. Grande The Edge. Radio Doble Nueve
...and who cares what f**king key it's in! Mongs who moan about that shit
Even better than the real thing + until the end of the world =
Best thing I can say about Jimmy, he's a big fan of U2.
Brilliant tune! works really well live! Edges singing is great. Anyone know what the tune is right at the end advertising fallon?
I just love them
Yup! U2> The band! The myth! The legend... I say! 😎
Awesome! Who better than them on this kind of lyrics.
Beautiful
Welcome back lads.
Sempre grandi
Album worderful 🎼🎤🎼🎧🎼🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵
와 보노성님\n아직 건재하시네ㄷㄷ
A melhor banda de todos os tempos!
U2 continua sendo a maior e melhor banda de todos os tempos!!! Parabens!!
Es una nueva y linda canciòn pop-rock
E niente da fare dal vivo riescono a farmi apprezzare, e anche tanto, anche i brani che registrati non mi convincono subito. Quindi ci piace!
this song is embarrassing
please stop releasing new album and just retour previous
dogshit
This band has released nothing beyond banal pop music since The Unforgettable Fire <-- last U2 album I bought. Saddens me to see such influential indie ppl go so horribly wrong. Joshua Tree was cold and calculated and determined. Prior to JT, all was slightly wild and whimsical and clangingly political; meant to waken the heart and stir the spirit.  These guys should have retired in 1985...when college radio and underground still meant something...
I will say it rock and roll is dead terrible
More Pop than Rock, not quite the best thing about them!
Nope, they've lost it. They have been making the same song the last 3 albums. The Edge is repeating the same riff too many times now. I smell laziness.
just dull....
The last 2 albums have been absolutely shocking!!! This sounds worse!
Did anone else hear Bono burp at 1:28?
U2 ,,christ all there songs sound the same .. boring.\nHow they ever got this far just proves people's taste in music is shit.
LOL This songs sucks! All that garbage that they cancelled the new album release because of trump is obviously a lie to deflect the fact the new album stinks and the last album stinks! They don;t even play songs from the last album on the tour because\nthere was not a single hit sing on the album worth playing to satisfy the fans\n\nthis song is boring complete garbage and this is what they release as the single!! The rest of the album must be even worse\n\nAnother U2 album I will not be buying
The scary thing is that this song is another pile of shit from u2 and still people laud it.....u2 are finished
They need to stick to playing their old and irrelevant rehashed music, nothing worse than 60+ y/o rich as fuck soft rock musicians who are not even American talking shit about American politics. Remember guys in rock bands back in high school? Are these the guys that you really want to hear spouting political opinions? These were the guys that were usually too stoned to stay awake during civics class.
when she said this is me....I knew what she meant I knew exactly about that painful release....I'm so glad it's over J you are free! now Slay like you do!!!!!!!
Heartbreaking to see her break down. The song must have incredibly personal layers to it, all the more now than before.
I felt that and cried with her. I love you Janet!!!
Wait what....did she say this is me at the end!???
Thanks sooo much for uploading. Can't wait to see her in Dec
WE LOVE U JANET. IT'S GONNA BE OK.
She sounds like Michael.
I commend her for leaving that toxic marriage. 🖕Domestic violence
Janet has so many great unreleased tracks that she could release a greatest hits album of them, and this would be in the top 3 songs that she never officially released.  Trust a Try, Enjoy, and This Body that Loves You are 3 others she should have released.
Thanks Janet for showing love to Htown. Florida gone need some love too. Stay blessed!
It hurts my heart to see her break down and cry. I truly understand her pain of having to divorce a man you truly cared about. She's my Sheroe... she's human too...we all go through things....
I am so sorry Janet, You will be back in love soon with Me
Damn 😪 I'm glad she was strong enough to walk away.
Yes Janet get the messages out
It's going to be alright love God got u,I jus read what Randy wrote about this moment she going through it I love u Janet God gets the last word u will come out bigger and better 🙏🙏🙏🙏💜💜💜💜
I wonder whether she has postpartum depression
Oh yeah Queen Janet spilled tea by adding this song to the set list...Wissam if I ever see you, you gon get these hands, you evil muthafucka! Glad she got out of it with the baby she's always wanted and MEGA coins to boot!!!
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS NEVER 😞KAY! FREE YOSLF QUEEN JANICE JACKSON! SANG THRU THE PAIN SISTAH, RELEASE ALL OF IT & U ARE NOT ANYONE'S DORMAT!❤💖💓💗💜   I'M GLAD 2 👀 U DOING WHAT U WORKED HARD 4 & YOSECOND LOVE PERFORMING, I BELIEVE YO1ST LOVE IS YO BABYBOI WHO LOVES U UNCONDITIONALLY! ❤🌟💃💙

I totally felt this pain!
4:07 So sad. Touched my heart. We love you Janet.
💜💯
Her ex husband beating her at every stage of her marriage, i.e. The different shape of the girls body. She had the courage to break the cycle. Her life with him in song.
December 17, Atlanta , Phillips Arena  ( Her  FINAL  stop  on  37  city  tour !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! )
Everytime I see this video and hear this song I cry.  The performance is electrifying....
U R the Queen Of POP Ms. Jackson

She left him ,good now her son won't see that shit happen to his Momma!Love you Janet.You are totally doing the right thing!I was with a man that broke my nose ,and pulled me by the hair just to slam my head on floor gave me a concussion! Worst time of my life .So when I seen this  brought me back.I started tearing up too cause I know.Thank you Janet for showing me that I am NOT alone.Much love!(I am no longer with him)
This song was on The Velvet Rope album so it came out in like, '97.
Wow amazing! We love you Janet. So powerful! #janfam #jtribe
leave that demon alone. #Nocontact
Bravo Janet Jackson
Very touching subject. happens too often to many women.
Can't wait to see her November 16th.
Men are victims of abuse too. Problem is, our gynocentric, man-hating, feminist society prefers catering to the issues and needs of girls and women, while routinely overlooking/ignoring/pooh-pooing the issues boys and men are plauged with. In case you weren't aware, the male homeless and suicide rate is FAR higher than it is for women, and 40% of the victims of domestic abuse and sexual assault are men. This goes for both gay and straight men.

Slow down the credits. 4:03 Bowl supplier Ian Hecox
Oh my God!!! That's the exact same speaker I have XD. I was using it as I was watching this and frigging thought why does he have my speaker XD
No problem Anthony I always watch your videos
THIS IS SO FUCKIN GOOD
Hey Anthony! I may be familiar with u. Just saying...
Oh god I've had this song stuck in my head all day long. Screw you anthony, you're a genius.
I only looked at the title and I thought this was from buzz feed

Why am i so scared :v
Now this is quality content. If only ian were here..
I just noticed the Satan thing wtf lol
dude, i had so much fun watching smosh as a kid with my friends, good old times, but im not liking this stuff, also i stopped watching smosh since it became a brand, im literally following u guys since the beggining </3 thanks for being part of my childhood and hope you get more and more views, but i dont like it, just my opinion, maybe im just saying that because i hope you could do stuff like the old times, but just keep doing what you like, have fun
Kids this is why we listen to our teachers when they say math it better
Jajajajajaja authentically amazing! I almost can't saw all the video because of laughing...
Wait one of them was Dan? Was it U? I hope it was U. That or A.
I love how at the end of the credits it says: \nRat- Daniel Howell
Why was this so terrifyingly funny😂😂
omg this is actually a really good video, humor and horror both shows off!!! anytting horror with kid songs are scary
I am still sad about Anthony leaving smosh 😩😩😩😩😩😓😓😓🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧😓😓😓😓☹️☹️☹️😢😢😢

OMG just realized something.\nThis is all Ys fault.\nY got mad because he's sometimes a vowel and he didn't get to be in the vid so he killed everyone.\nLol so random
This is some post-irony shit and this is incredible
I only realized until E was dying that they all were only able to say their vowel. i thought they all just had really bad accents.
This is such a smart idea hahaha clever!

what accent is he speaking in?
Is it purpose or coincidence? The blood pattern on the walls match their letters. example U's blood pattern made an italicized u mark pattern. letter O's blood pattern almost formed a complete circle blood pattern. I's scattered blood pattern is slanted but resembles an letter I. E's blood pattern on the right side is a slanted E. and A's blood pattern on the right side, the upper is a triangle, and below it is 2 legs, which combined forms an A. Can anyone relate?

Have questions for us?! Ask them over on Super Carlin Gaming!
i bet newt is hagrid's father
I always wondered\nWhat was hagrid's house when he was a student
YOU NEED TO UPDATE YOUR INTRO
Caffeine. His shirt is the molecular structure of caffeine.
Answer. He got another wand....... Harry's wand broke. He just used another wand. I'm sure Dumbledore was able to pull some strings and get him and somewhat ok wand.
Try connect all HP theories in one vid. Do they line up? I have no idea 😂
Wait wasn't Hagrid in his third year when he was expelled? Shouldn't that have made him 13, not 15? Or did he start school at a later age?
personally i like the thought that Hagrid is just accidentally amazing at wandless magic.\n\nMagic is all about intent. Because Hagrid THINKS he wand still works, it does.\n\nBit silly yeah but i find it amusing
why was hagrids wand snapped in the first place? newt was expelled for basically the same reason, and his wand is fine.
So I haven't read the books and I was wondering, can magic users do magic without wands?
What I always wondered; what did Lilly see in Severus?
Newt should have been Care of Magical Creatures teacher at Hogwarts ❤
This is an amazing theory and I really hope you're right. I would love to see Hagrid under Newt's tutelage. It would create a perfect connection to everything.
Yea, right... But damn, I need that Slotherin pillow so bad!!
The books tell you what happened this isn't necessary
I literally didn't even notice the umbrella was pink...
Ben, caffeine belongs in your coffee not on your shirt. Lol
Hey! Did you guys know that sir Cadogan (or whatever) CAN actually be spotted in the prisoners of azkaban(movie) when the fat lady portrait is broken. You guys should make a video about it!
My question is why do they even have umbrellas in the wizarding world in the first place. In fantastic beasts we see them use a spell to produce an ubrella and fantastic beasts is a PREquel. So the fact that his umbrella does nothing and that his umbrella can produce an umbrella baffles me.
💥💥💥 *mind blown*💥💥💥\nYou have No idea how happy watching this video made me. It filled in so many blanks n got me super pumped for Fantastic beasts!!! 😄😄😄\nUr awesome!
Please tell me the truth about OLAF in FROZEN
How is Hagrid fifteen when he is in his third year? 3:54
Why do we never see any magical patronus animals throughout the series? We see a phoenix from Dumbledore, but how come no students or teachers have magical creature patroni?
This is a great theory and I definitely hope we will get to see the duel in the movies, hopefully in the last one, but you have made one mistake, or rather not explained an apearent mistake by the books. If Grindelwald was not the master of the elder wand because he was defeated before his duel with Dumbledore, how come Dumbledore became the master of the elder wand after he beat Grindelwald. I wouldn´t even mind this plothole so much, except it is almost the same idea THE CLIMAX OF THE ORIGINAL SERIES IS RESULTED BY!
You just really destroyed my fantastic beasts experience...as if this theory is happens to be true..then I have already got the spoilers😔😔
Before I watch the video... Dumbledore is the owner of the elder wand. Having suspicions about tom riddle...dumbledore simply repairs the wand for Hagrid and continues to teach him magic in spare time over the years (we all know Dumbledore doesn't really value the ministry of magic's laws)...he could have easily aided Hagrid in concealing his wand and repairing it.
If anything remotely close to this makes it's way into the fantastic beasts franchise, you should get paid.
Cool theory, but unfortunately you don't know transfiguration. First of all, no matter how good the transfigurator is, the transfigured object can't stay in the new form forever, sooner or later it'll change back. Second of all, magic objects are non-transfigurable.
Am I the only one who says duel like dew-e-l not dool
This is a great theory!!!!
thats truly a great and exciting theory !!!
I got a cherry wood wand, 14 and a half inches, phoenix core. I'm quite happy with it. =)
Assuming that it is Rex, can you do a video about how he ended up in Wall-E's collection? It could make quite the sad story.
Have you ever thought that your theories are correct until you post a video out the theory? Exec producer: Well we can't use that idea any more because someone just figured it out.
can you please please please do a video about how tom riddle wasn't an obscurial!!!!!!!
I was wondering do you reckon a basilisk would make an appearance in fantastic beasts and where to find them
I want this to be true so bad
Also a friend of mine ask me this how is cars born  after watching cars3
I used to really like these videos and then realised then I that you just use the material right off pottermore....
I love this theory!!!
You make it too difficult... Dumbledore knows due to legilimency that Hagrid didn't release the basalisk.  He knows Hagrid is being blamed for something he didn't do but can't change people's minds due to anti-giant bias.  So he has him kept on as groundskeeper and after himself obtaining the Elder wand, might have fixed it.  More likely however it is as his discussion with Ollivander states... He says that he still has the pieces to which Ollivander says he hopes he doesn't use them, to which Hagrid fumbles at the umbrella.
I remember the yellow ball with the star on it, I remember seeing it in a show I used to watch. I just can't pinpoint which episode it is. Which show is it from?
To SCB's defense, i saw Seamus' video 2 weeks ago and the theories are not exactly the same. I think it's a coincidence that they made videos about similar topics and I seriously doubt they would watch Seamus' video and purposely take the idea. Seamus talked more about how Dumbledore might have mentored Hagrid and SCB talked more about his wand and how it would've been fixed and predicting his role in the next Fantastic Beasts movie. Y'all are getting upset over something that's not a huge issue. I hope they come out and say something.
Maybe Newt is a relative of Hagrid somehow?
the real question is who should play Hagrid\npersonally i say The Mountain from Game of Thrones
Do you hear that? I think it's the sound of all of your viewers minds simultaneously\nexploding!
Hey Brother ! I need to presentate myself for my class. I'm a nerd and I think the most of us here (what is awesome). I was searching on YouTube, but I couldn't find a really good clip of it. So I thought that you could explain in a clip how awesome and cool it is to be a nerd.thumbs if you want to see this happen.And please comment on this.
Ok. Ready. Harry didn't get the elder wand from Draco. But he got it in the cave from the half blood prince. When Harry makes dumbledore drink the potion that makes him relive his worst memory. He drop his wand
in case you didn't know there is a place in Switzerland called Grindelwald. just if you wanted that, then your welcome. however if you already knew it then... just checking.
When I was young I thought Hagrid was weird for hanging out with little kids but now that I'm older he has become my favorite character. I wish he was my friend lol
i wish the cc did not fill the whole screen.
Love this theory guys, I hope the theory appears to be true in the upcoming FB movies.
As much as I like Hagrid, and as horrible as it was that Hagrid got blamed for Myrtle Warren's death, I agree with his expulsion because he did have a dangerous monster in the castle, even if it wasn't the one causing the attacks. Acromantulas eat humans, and having one in a school... yeah, Hagrid deserved to be expelled and should never have been a teacher.
Hi Love this video 💖 I have an amazing idea for a new series that you should both watch Once Upon A Time which is on Netflix ❤️
Hagrid was 13/14 when expelled. Not 15. He was a third year. So unless he was held back...
Harry didn't win elder wand from voldemort... he won from draco malfoy
If Dumbledore was born in 1881, and the happening with Ariana was when Dumbledore just had finished his school (1898/99)– how is it possible, that the legendary battle between him and Grindelwald was in 1945 (Dude, that sentence...)\n\nReminder, after the sudden death of Ariana, Dumbledore struggled with himself around 5 years to fought Grindelwald, until the community literally forced him to. (Because he feared the chance, to find out, that he killed his own sister with his very own curse).\n\nSo, the battle must've been round about 1903/04. Or did I miscalculate?\n\nP.S.: Sry for my bad Grammar. My English sucks.. ^^
It's also possible that Grindlewald loses mastery of the elder wand before the duel, or that Dumbledor knows a trick to defeating the master of the elder wand. After all, the invisibility cloak is another deathly hallow and supposedly completely hides its wearer, even from death, but Dumbledor knew exactly where he was. Dumbledor believes that these items, elder wand included, are not really what they are said to be, but simply very powerful magical items. Thus, the elder wand is not impossible to beat, just imbues its master with a lot more power, making them a lot harder to beat. Therefor, all Dumbledor need do is be clever about it and also be powerful himself by a wide enough margin to make-up the difference. He defeats Grindlewald, becomes the owner of the wand and fixes Hagrid's wand.
Loving the Woody and Buzz toys in the background by the way
I just thought that Dumbledore secretly fixed Hagrid's wand with the elder wand because he knew that Hagrid had nothing to do with the incidents.
I just realized Quidditch teams could just go to the room of requirement and get a bunch of steroids and firebolts.
If your names not j k Rowling hen your theory is bs! And her and warner bros sue any one who tries to monetise off of Harry Potter
What a cool theory I hope this is right
Fantastic theory! I really hope it's right
Are you guys Christians
omg this my first vid watching a vid of yours in 2017
I've thought Dumbledore repaired hayride wand for a long time
what house was Hagrid in?
3:58 Wasn't Hagrid expelled in his 3rd year? I'm pretty sure he stated in the first book that he was expelled in his third year.
I would absolutely love to see a young Hagrid. And a scenario like this would be great. It would explain so much and add such depth to Hagrid's character.
Harry did not win it from Voldemort. He won it from Draco Malfoy
That would make so much sense
Pausing at 42 seconds.\n\nDumbledore it's alwayse deus ex dumbledore.\n\nI so hope I right making this WAG.
I came up with this theory like 2 years ago I mean you just had to connect the dots in the books.
But if newt has already beaten grindlewald with his beasts could that mean newt is the master of the elder wand and neither Harry or dumbledore have ever been the masters

Fenty Beauty Review Please! ☺️💖
You are such a cutie!\n\nXXX
shaan is my inspiration 😍 Love all your videos sooo much. Ive just started my youtube chanel any smaller chanels come say hi and we can do a sub for a sub 😋😋😋😋
love your hair color with your pale skin 😍😍😍
That look is so beautiful!! Could you do a review on the fenty beauty range if possible please shan!!! 😍
Wow this is a beautiful makeup look on you! 💖
why would you put primer on top of foundation and powder? of course it's gonna look cakey 🤷🏼‍♀️
Yes Shannon!!! You look amazing and happy 🙌🏼
Ergh my god ive had years of stress n crap n i look way better that you  where you have make up or not
Can you do a video on the best blushes to get and what works best with different skin tones etc??
You are such an inspiration and an uplifting person. I've been going through quite a rough patch and being a part of the Shan-Clan makes it just a little more bearable. Your videos always put me in such a better mood. Thank you for always being yourself because you're awesome. Don't ever let anyone tell you otherwise
It would be amazing if you could do a full face of ELF and essence products! Since they're so cheap and cruelty free, it'd be so helpful! Love your videos x
Hi Shannon! Love your videos! I was wondering if you still scared of needles at the bloodtests of that it gets better when you do it often.  I'm very scared of needles myself. Love from the Netherlands xxx
Can you try Rihanna's new gently highlighters
I have super fair skin like you :) it makes me SO happy to see more of you embracing it, I know you've been and Lauren Curtis and Kathleen lights etc. I used to always see everyone always fake tanned and it's just so nice to see you embracing the pale! Haha
Loved this video and you! so pretty. Before everything was don't I think the cheeks looked like Neapolitan ice cream
Your hair 😍

Love your videos 😍😍
مرحبا
What's with all the adverts mid video???? 😡😡😡
What brushes would you recommend from your brand to buy first for a full, complete face??? 😁 I really need to invest more on my brushes. Lol.
that liquid lip is amazing
I love how she just randomly made an eye look and it came out so pretty and can you do a smashbox lip swatches?
This look is beautiful!
Why don't you post declutter videos anymore?!?!
The eye primer looks like it might work like the Wet & Wild one. Use a small amount and blend with your finger on ONLY the lid. If you take it any farther it gets gross and clumpy looking - like your skin is super dry and peeling. Also, set it with  a normal setting powder.
Can you do Rihanna's fenty  first impression video? Btw love your videos keep doing you Xx
Pleaseee review Rihanna's new foundation.. when you get time, I know you're busy lol💕💕❤️ 😘
I'm absolutely loving these full face first impression videos! I like the idea of reviewing the products, but I prefer your tutorials/chit chats more than just an impression on one product. This combines both! Keep doing these <3
Omg, didn't finish this video, almost laugh and smlied sooooo much. I LOVE YOU <3. Greetings from Germany PS: love you and all of your videos
Do a full face of second impressions video 👌🏻👌🏻
Omg i loove you eyebrows 😍😍and the makeup soo beautiful 😻😻🙈
Please review Rihanna's new fenty beauty line ! Love to see your reviews before I go out and buy a new product!! 💕😘
Hi Shannon!!! love your videos! just wondering if you can do ideas for dry skin !
This eyelook is soooo stunning on you! It makes your eyes pop sooo much✨😍😍😍
plz do a fenty beauty review! i wanna see how u think of rihanna's beauty line
I really love your accent ❤
Do a first impression on Fenty Beauty!!!!!
What was the lip mask she used? I might've overlooked it in the description!
girl your brows! I am in love
Your so pretty!😍
Hi Shannon 😍😍😍😍😍
I love ❤️ your natural eyelashes 😍😍
Goddamn you always look so amazing peach tone lipsticks
i tried the lancome matte shakers and boy are those intense! I also tried some of the Elizabeth Arden new gelato collection and the lipsticks they came out with are amazing. I haven't tried that blush yet..
Maybe it's cakey cause u applied Concealer then powder then another liquid on top of powder then powder again....
I love your videos!! I honestly dont wear makeup at all but I still watch these cause your my fav ❤💖
I love that she corrected 3016 to 2017 lmao
gorgeous as always! will you be reviewing the jaclyn hill palette at all? love u <3
Your first impression videos are definitely one of my favorites from you :)) Looove the look xx
Does anyone know if those are her natural lashes or does she use some kind of lash grower?? I need your lashes Shannon😣😍
Love your brushes! Can't wait to purchase some...hopefully soon. Proud for and of you girl!!!💕
Omg i had the same reaction to the jelly pack product!! But I love it now that I'm used to it
I agree with what you said about the companies. When I was 14 or so and the Drugstore Makeup was soooo shit and now I don't see the need in buying high end stuff because the drugstore is so good now!
You really should try and review Lumene skincare from Finland 😇 i'd love to hear what you think of it 🙊
hello shanxoo... can you make a video about brushes functions and uses??? it would be so helpful thanks:)
Do you have fillers on your lips?
Hi Shannon, could you do a 1920s makeup tutorial pleeeease😀
It's Monday 3pm western Australia time, howcome her videos not up yet? Or doesn't she do 3 videos a week , Monday Wednesday and Friday, now??
I suuuuuper love the makeup look. Love it even more without eyeliners 🔥🔥 Please also try the face primer along with a dewy finish foundation.
That primer though right, so awesome, I thought it was going to be difficult blending the foundation because the primer was so sticky! I wonder if you try those shimmer/foils from the She palette with an eye primer that you are comfortable with if they work any better? Just a thought, also wonder if maybe the beauty bakery ones don't like playing with others? I really want the She palette but if those shimmer fail that bad not sure ill get it now, 😞
Is there anyway you can do a bh cosmetics 88 matte eyeshadow look with only that palette. Because I can't ever really figure out how to make a look with it
Make up, turns any 6 into a 9.
Update: I just to the part of the video where you said your eyebrows look weird. Girl, noooooo😍
You're pronouncing karruchewrong, it's ka-roo-chi as in karruche tran (Chris browns ex lol)
Can you do a Rihanna Fenty beauty first impression 😊😍
i like those eyeshadows they seemed to much but settled down after a while.i will try that is it because they soak in or is it from them blending in with the oils of skin?
i love you shan!
With that mascara, you don't even need lashes!
She is my makeup inspiration she is amazing and super pretty without makeup. she is the one who inspired me to do makeup I love her sooooooooo much
Hi Shannon I just did a makeup look using your palette! It's my fav! Check it out of ur bored! Love u xo
You look amazing as always. Your talent amazes me. I didn't like the way the KKW contour and bronzer looked at all but everything else was stunning xxxx
Whenever im sad i just come to this channel and it makes me so happy. Keep up the good work shann
I know this has nothing to do with the video but pleaassee help!\nYesterday I bought the NYX Tres Jolie gel pencil liner and it just doesn't do anything for me. I bought it because KathleenLights recommended but it just doesn't work. I've tried to put it on my waterline but there's no ink🤦 I've warmed it up but still...\nIf you own it please tell me your experience or some tips to make it work cause I'm broke to go and buy another one lol hahahahah
I want to go back blonde.  What color do you dye your hair and what toner do you use?
Hmm I wonder if using a setting spray will make this any better...\n*applies eyeshadow*\n...Marginally.\nI love your word choice 😂🙌🏼💜
I would love to see the new too faced peaches and creme lipstick swatches 😍 I have yet to see anyone swatch them all.
Did you guys get engaged!? Did I miss something haha
Love the look and love you, of course :)
Your videos are good and Please make a video for pores skin make up
Any small YouTubers want to support each other??

Can you review Fenty Makeup by Rihanna please
shannon, do you remember in your do's and dont's video you said never use concealer that is too light for your skin tone, well that's what you did and you put on a lot. So don't tell us not to do that but then you did that
How do you keep your eyelashes healthy ? I used to have really long and thick eyelashes but now since I've been wearing waterproof mascara for 3 years they've gotten really thin and always breaking and they look weird with mascara now :( any ideas on how to get healthy thick lashes again
do a series of Marc Jakabe eyeshadows
Lovely singing Emilia! I was touched. Our God is a GreatBig God all the time. It's so refreshing to learn that schools are still  teaching our kids about the goodness of  God .
OMG when Emilia was singing are god has a whole wide world in his hands I remember the last time I sung that which was last year
Do Amelia and Eduardo go to a private school? There uniform looks very posh. 💗
Omg, Emilia's uniform is killing me.  it's so cute!
I'm a bata child 😂
Oh my gosh I remember singing that at my primary school!! Xx
I learnt that God song in primary school!!
Omg the blogs are so quiet without Emilia
Is Emilia going into kindergarten
Love all the videos\nI look up to u guys 💜💜💜
You were RIGHT!!  😧 This day will live in infamy!  👓  Anna just threw us under the bus..🤦🏻‍♀️ Lol
So Jonathan, when are you gonna get Alessia's name tattooed on your body?
Our GOD is a great BIG GOD.  That was lovely, Emilia!!!!
Ohhhhh Emilia & Eduardo looked so gooood in their uniform...Eduardo looks good with his haircut!!!!
Our god is a great big god 😂 Anyone else do that in primary school?
omg lol! the husband being right part i was crying laughing!!!
I wasn't the Beta child... i was the back up child haha!
Alessia has the most beautiful eyes 😍
Eduardo and his chocolate stars lol so cute!!!  😂
I reckon the clip that Jonathan was talking about filming was Anna's pregnancy announcement, that we'll see in a couple of months!! ;)
Awww...Emilia's little song was adorable. ❤️
you will love our brand new show. come on over to our channel and check it out. why not subscribe while your there. we guarantee to make you smile
It is a running joke in my family that as the first born I am the practice child.
That gay guy has 3 kids????????
Omg Emilia. Total fancy pants with the salmon on toast! 😂 (and so friggin cute!) 💕
Who else thinks that Emilia is really good at singing?
I'm the youngest of three but I made sure I wasn't forgotten about
Emilia and Eduardo are too cute when they vlog <3 <3
I've Got Over 2000 Students In My School....It Is Mayhem
Hahahahahahahahaha Jonathan !! You're bad lol, to funny❤️ love you guys
is it a permanent birthmark on alessia's forehead?
I'm a beta child lmfao and i've never even thought of it that way
eduardo is so georgous nice to see him fr a change
Emilia has changed so much over the summer, she has developed so much confidence with the camera and grownup too. You can understand mostly everything she says and I think she is going to be amazing as she grows with mummy's makeup and fashion sense and daddy's film making and camera/production talent. Our two went back on Wednesday this week to secondary school for the first time, goodness Anna that really was tear jerking !! My twins are 11 !!! Would really love to chat. You two as we have a small but building channel inspired by you guys, we are the oggie house, please get in touch. Xx
Emilia singing our God is a great big God... 😢😢i cried
Beautiful family!  We are new subscribers!
Does anyone else feel old at how grown up Eduardo looks😫😂😊
The part of the song Emilia was missing was and he holds us in his hands😂 I learnt that song when I was about her age too😂😂
I love Emilia's posh little accent. She'd be such a good vlogger.
well i'm going back to uni next week, gonna miss home 😆
I used to watch years ago and thought I'd check up. It is me or is Jonathan dominating everything? Anna barely gets to speak
was having a break from gardenscapes but I saw you playing it and now i have to play it!!!!
They have grown up so much xx
Hi my name is Sacconejoly.  I exploit my children for cheap views and likes.
New Zealand school not even finished
THE INTRO IS SO CUTE! 😩😩🌹🌹🌹
and that was the day Jonathon was right .... hahahaha 😂
I don't know if its just me, but the content is getting like a lot of the same, but huge amounts of advertising for the kids stuff you've created.. I just feel like I'm growing out of this channel, and I don't like that :( I wish the content was enjoyable for people who don't have kids/are kids. I know that's my problem, but well, that's the reason why I'm not watching the videos anymore and will unsubscribe.. I'm sorry guys :( i've followed you for years..
I was back a school a week ago
Omg Jonathan's voice over when he was right, ... so funny I loved that
She is the big sister xx
I started year 8 3 days ago
Not being negative but you need to put the handle on the car seat up in the car, that helps protects the baby in a crash. 💗
I can tell that Emilia is going to be a great singer when she grows up
Hi I love your videos you all inspire me so much and you are amazing family x from leah hop you are all ok x
That was the day I Jonathan got it right .  So so funny the face
40 kids in a class... that is double what I had at school! I hope the kids have a fabulous first day back!
Expectation: Walking in a winter wonderland.\nReality: Walking through a cemetery.
I'm the beta child!
I'm dying when Anna said you were right, I guess, your face!!!!! It's the same face my husband makes when I say that to him!!! I nearly peed my pants laughing!!!
Emilia's singing is actually really good
The very first time I went to school I didn't even say bye to my parents I just ran off to play lol
That song Emilia was singing i remember singing it at primary school
I absolutely love the striped school dresses!! So cute Emilia!
Well I have been in school  since mid August so haha. #collegelife
Yay Johnathon was right! lol Enjoy it ;) Love you Anna!
Watching Emilia and Eduardo grow and develop personalities and character is so interesting and amazing to watch!
Emilia is such a good little singer!!!
The slow mo when jonathan is right hahaha dying
I literally died laughing when you had that slo- mo and said today you got it right hahahaha
Alessia's getting so big watching her sit up is adorable
Hey beauties, I just created a back to school best friend channel where we can come and lay out our  dramas (like to get advice) that I hope turns into the biggest YouTube family. Intro video out, check it out please🤗🤗😘😘
13:00 good singing with an American accent
Wise up... they're going to school not to jail...snow flakes
I'm homeschooled so when everyone goes back to school me and my mom go shopping and go for lunch because it's never busy then I start work the next day 😂😂
So they just never talked about how they live right there next to a cemetery.  They also walk through it all the time \n🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉🙈🙈🙈🙈
Emilia should have her own show. She is so funny and confident
Emelia is so grown up now! Feels like yesterday I was watching her baby vlogs. And Eduardo too😫 xx
No hate! I think Eduaro looks younger, intens, with his new hair cut😲
I think I tear up when Emilia was singing at the end. 💗
Our god is a great big GodOur god is a great big god Our god is a great big god And he holds us in his handsHe's higher than a skyscraper and Deeper than a submarine He is wider than the universe beyond my wildest dreamsAnd he loves me and holds me since before the world began. How wonderful to be apart of Gods amazing planOur god is a great big godOur god is a great big godOur god is a great big godAnd he holds us in his hands
I had to sing the song Emilia learnt when I went to primary. It was a long time ago but I still remember it. Bought back lots of memories for me :)
So cute <33333 Emilia is the CUTEST lil vlogger on youtube, I loved the beginning <33333
PImp My Family episode #765

Eduardo: my tummy growling cos I'm hungry\nEmilia: that's whyyyyyyy!

Is the UK's reception equivalent to America's 1st grade- which comes after kindergarten here?
HELLO FRIENDS!! hope u guys enjoy this strange franken-video! how do u guys think it did? i wanna make more!!
Maybe she should try scraping abit of all her eye shadows and press it into one colour and use it? Or highlighter
Hi, is there any small youtubers want to support each other? 😋
you should do this without bb and cc creams and skin tints or do a just drugstore one
I hope buzzfeed would not steal the idea of this video. Just like themixing of lipsticks .
It matches you perfectly keep using it
Hi safiya can you please let me know where you got the bottle to mix your foundation and I've been looking for one like that for months and months please and thank you I love the video by the way you're an amazing person and I'm also from Chicago
*waits for buzzfeed's video about the exact same thing*
It's a little on the (adjective) side
we have the same name! hi, safiya 😂💕
You are so pretty and your eyeliner is so perfecccctttt!!!!! 💜💜
Hey! Can I know what's that App called which u showed in the starting!😊
Can you mix all your eyeshadows together
Every time you say the word smash incorrectly a puppy dies.
Wow you have a lot of foundation
You should make loads of bottles and sell them to us, seems like a pretty damn good foundation!!
Why do you have more than one???? Fucking rich fucknuts
I have both yellow and pink undertones (I'm very pale) and mixing them together changed my life tbh. Would recommend.
I think you should do a video wearing the typical summer fashion trends of the year you where born.
Look at that Face!
I don’t know if you have done this before but i think you should do the wavy makeup trend for a day
Is it me or do the foundation looks way to brown for her skin bc she is really pale ? Or maybe its just the camera
Wow I thought I was the only one who did the double chin check
I think you should wax your hand😂
Can all small YouTubers support me? Subscribe to my channel. Like and comment on my recent video and I will subscribe back. Thanks everyone. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GYYXrgyUSUw
This video really showed how great your editing skills are, hearing you talk while showing clips of all the pumping. Everything looks super professional and it still feels personal and fun. Thumbs up!
Do a updated what's in my bag in December plzzzzzzzzzzzzz
You look so much prettier with a not full coverage foundation :D
I think she was describing a circle jerk more than a baseball team 😂😂😂 #weknowwhatyouwatch
Why do I watch these? I'm a guy and i've watched like 3 of her videos involving make up n stuff.
You should give that foundation to me. Im dying 😂
Ok you should do eyebrows next. Like mix all your eyebrow things together so then you can have your face lips and eyebrows all mixed😂
I had a good experience with the makeup lady at Walgreens they had a machine thing that told me my shade and undertone
Everytime she rubs the foundation on the paper it hurts my soul. Have you ever starched paper?
Does anyone know what the container she is using is? and like where to get one?
The whole time I admired how perfect and symmetrical the eyeliner and wings were
Okay this is such a rude thing to say and that's not my intention, but your face is so shiny in this video.
Mix highlighter or countour or eyeliner or blush or concealer or powder or Eyeshadow pweessshh
Can you do a video where you get people's reaction to an all LED light up outfit ?! Love your vids BTW ! 💙
you have great arm hair! sexy! And your bushy eyebrows.. and ..
She has a monotonous voice
Try fenti foundation u might find the perfect shade
I like how your freckles show through, it's CUTEEEEEE
do a waxing video on your arms !!
I actually like the foundation and lipstick together
My little brother thought u put peanut butter on ur face
THE MOMENT BEFORE SHE SAID FRANKENSTATION I THOUGHT IT
This was awesome! So, you did nude lipsticks, how about some reds? :)
the nails on the paper, tho
you should do a franken-perfume.
I LIKE THE MIX!! Lol
Wow, it actually looks great. I'm shocked!
She needs to shave he arms
You should make your own makeup line of Frankenstein makeup
DO A FULL FACE OF MIXED TOGETHER PRODUCTS LIKE ALL YOUR FOUNDATION, CONCEALER, BRONZERS, MASCARA, ETC
Saf, you're so much more beautiful without makeup );
i don't like to throw things away either. I look at things before I throw them away.
o n e g o o d s q u i r t
I uhh don't like her voice it's annoying my opinion for all those people that would probably cuss me out if you do cuss me out then fuck you
I custom made a highlighter by combining my lightest glitter shadows then pressing the combination, could be an idea?
Do more like this please
She was wearing her blindfolded shopping outfit
You should mix nude eye shadows next
To be honest this is the best looking foundation I've ever seen on you. Especially with your freckles peaking though.
Next time you should mix ALL of your lipsticks together and wear them! Not just nudes!
You should do a review on fenty beauty foundation!
YOU DESCRIBED THE FENTY BEAUTY FOUNDATION! RIH DIDN'T MAKE 40 SHADES FOR NO REASON! SHE HAS A FOUNDATION JUST FOR YOU SIS!!
Waste. .. that's it
Can I buy some?😂
your natural skin is so beautiful omg
I'm way more impressed with your eyeliner staying on all day!
I just came from James Charles videos and had the speed at 0.75 because he talks hella fast and then when I came to this videos I couldn't figure out why Safiya was talking so slow 😂😂
Your bare face looks so good! Love your freckles and that they were visible through the foundation ^.^ <3
Safiya, you should try/do a review of Rihanna's new makeup 'Fenty beauty '.it is said to have every shade for every skin, so you might be able to find that perfect foundation for your skin tone.
Hello safiya. What foundation would you suggest for medium yellow undertoned people? :)
He died for science
You should do a video of wearing a full face of franken-makeup for a full day! 💄
I thought it looked good
Those chokers are from the video but my outfit blindfolded thumbs up if you agree
Waiting for Fenty by Rihanna Makeup collection review 😃
Do the eyebrown trend😂
do mascara
ģģdaew
So does she call her lipstick , safiyahs nudes?
You look beautiful
Frankenbase!
i thought i am watching Dua Lipa's makeup tutorial. hahahha
Mix your perfumes together
i am arys litl cusin
Different formulas together.
Foundanstein...
Youre wearing the chokers from the blindfolded outfit spree!!
HIGHLIGHT!!!
I subscribe :D
It looked great! 😍
was she  from buzzfeed
So uneven
The gabbie show??
PUMPED lmao
Ur very beautifull
I can't believe Beatrice's dad is played by Matthew Broderick. I totally didn't recognize him
This makes the scene where Bojack threw the doll out the window ten times more fucked up. Jesus Christ.
when she was a child his father order to burn everything, why? she had  scarlet fever.\n\nagain, lets remmember, scarlet fever was the leading cause of death of children in the 50s and 60s, it was a virus that spread on to personal belongings, so they had to get rid of everything, im not defending bea's father, he was a misogynistic, racist, elitist piece of shit, but he was a result of his time.\n\ngranted, he should have explained why he was burning everything to his young girl, but he didnt, because he doesnt know to treat women feeling and he wont learn (s4e2).\n\nthe 50s were fucked up, it was too much man!
this episode deserves a fucking emmy
This series really needs more marketing. Fuck, the only thing i saw was a Netflix trailer a couple of weeks ago, then nothing. Rick and Morty has got a lot of marketing behind it (rightfully deserved, because i love it), but why not Bojack? There were some amazing episodes in this season
We've had Clorox since 1913. Joseph could've disinfected the doll instead of burning it. He went for the quickest, dirtiest, most traumatic solution possible.\n\nJust like he did with his wife.
Essay question;  All this being discovered this season really changes the perspective on a lot of internal problems Bojack has. Should what Todd said in season 3 about all Bojack's problems being self created and has nothing to do with his past still be valid? Go.
what's the piano track that starts playing at 1:52 called?
So how does procreation work in this universe
The painting on the wall shifts between her two families
This was really stressful to watch, but good on them for humanizing Beatrice. This is easily my favorite season.
Abuse and trauma are cyclical. Your parents will pass them on to you. You may never know why, and your parents might not even realize it.
I like how child Beatrice yelling NO MY BABY sounds just like when old Beatrice yells NO MY BABY in a previous episode.
Did anyone notice the family portrait in the background?
This episode was amazing. Usually in the case of this person is evil but look how tragic their past was I struggle to get that invested anymore but fuuuuuuck, even though I've seen more tragic backstories the way this episode was done just broke my heart. Doesn't make Beatrice's actions justified but I think the way she treated the Hollyhock situation really cemented how damaged her way of thinking had become. Give these creators an Emmy god damn.
thanks random youtuber for uploading the saddest thing ever. i needed to cry hysterically i'm sure anyway.
Can't tell who's worse or more loath-able...\n\nButterscotch or Joseph?
Even though I wish they showed more side characters like Todd and character actress margo martindale!! The way they made Beatrice sympathetic is amazing. \nOne of the best and most fucked up scenes of the series, all the parallels between characters.
Full teared on this one
sex with a horse would kill you. Giving birth to one will definitely kill you.
If her father really was like that and this was the standard of fatherly behavior in the 50s, I am so glad I didn't grow up in that era. Anyone who's nostalgic for those days needs a reality check.
Wait a second.. the star... on the foreheads beatrice her father and bojack have it, and so does the daughter does that mean bojacks father was not lying about his mother or is she really bojacks daughter and he slept with the help?
Remember when Hollyhock goes back to her family and Beatrice asks where the baby is?\n\nOh, that's right, I took the baby.\n\nShe took the baby from Henrietta.
I love how in 0:29 and how they used people's faces all scratched up to show how bojack's mother is sick and can't always remember what people look like or had with them.
It's painful that Beatrice's mom lost her mind because of the forced lobotomy. Beatrice then became a hateful person without love to avoid the same fate, only to have her mind slowly rot away to dementia anyways...
Getting darker(anybody get the reference)
that sound effect that plays when Beatrice's mother's silhouette appears in the flames is bone chilling
Am I the only one who thought this episode was as dark as Sarah Lynn last season? Easily the best episode aside from Episode 2.
the beginning of the theme song with the transition of bojack turning into henrietta made my heart sink.. i knew this episode was going to be fucked up as hell after watching that. i can officially say three cartoon characters have brought me to tears now, pearl from steven universe, beatrice horseman and sarah lynn
Time and Time again, we've seen how this season has shown us that hurt people hurt people, even if that wasn't their intentions. Whether it's Bojack or Princess Carolyn, or even Henrietta.. But Bojack's grandfather.. is byfar the worst character on the show. I understand that there's no excuse for Bojack or Henrietta's actions throughout the show, but the grandfather doesn't have that luxury to fall back on. Since he's been introduced, he's been dismissive and absent when it comes to dealing with any hardships that weren't his own. Instead of supplying comfort for his wife when she was in need he abandoned her and later had her lobotomized when her life was spiraling out of control. I can make a list of issues this dude has but.. it's just too depressing to go on.. to his that all this hate and hurt originated from one man who was just.. sickening
This was possibly the happiest season yet, but that doesn't mean we didn't get some scary shit.
I'm glad I'm emotionally strong enough not to cry, or sympathize with Beatrice for being a complete horses ass of a Queen Bitch. I do understand why she is that way, and all I can say is.....well, that's life sometimes.
Your sickness has infected everything, it all must be destroyed
your sickness has infected everything.\ni like the funny show with the talking horsies
I love Henrietta,, would love to see her in season five. Want to see her and Hollyhock reunite and spend time together.
If Hollyhock has that diamond birthmark, does that mean that Butterscotch wasn't lying to Beatrice when he told her that she reminded him of his dead mother?
One day, this will all be a pleasant memory...\n\nFuck. You.
Henrietta is such a whore
Beatrice was actually so nice to Henrietta, nicer than she was to anyone else tbh
So long college degree. Rick and Morty and Bojack Horseman are my world now :/
I didn't know how to feel about this scene, fuck man, this was fucked up...
there is soo much thought put into this episode like i think its really telling that she only reognies Bojack when he is walking away from her i guess his back is a more common sight for her then atually seeing his frount.
The only thing that bugs me is that hollyhawk has the diamond on her forehead.I mean her father doesn't have that diamond on his forehead thus bojack inherited that trait from his mother.But in the end is a show where a horse screws a human and she gives birth to a horse instead of a centaur.
Is it bad that I was too sad at the burning because it was that she had contaminated items \nHer father is the character I could ponder forever, he screwed up major with his family but it's not like he didn't love them. I'm pretty sure he regretted his wife's lobotomy earlier in the episode
This is probably,one of the best episodes ive seen in a long as time\n\nThe last good show with a episode that fucking amazing was Breaking Bad: Fly
The scene with Beatrice and her father at the fire place was actually really scary.
I'm not crying... someone put tears in my eyes :'C
This show is a masterpiece. Nothing more I say can do it justice.
The lobotomy Honey Sugarman had, is a reference to Rosemary Kennedy, sister of JFK, who had a lobotomy and left her numb for the rest of her life. Hell, even Joseph Sugarman shares name of JFK dad, Joseph Kennedy.
Christ I've been so busy I haven't been able to watch season 4\nSo I just tie myself over with YT clips\n\n\nI NEED MY DEPRESSED HORSE
This is so dark
THE FUCKING SOUND IT MAKES WHEN HER MOM WALKS OUT OF THE FIRE IS NIGHTMARE FUEL! 3:40
that's too much man
Bojack's grandpa was the devil
This is the best Bojack episode
this was like horror
We mess up our children and they mess up their children. That cycle has no end. Break the cycle. Be a better parent. If you can't, please, for the sake of the world, don't have children.
next season we are going to get a sad backstory for sugarman.
not to be dramatic but this episode made me cry
Time's Arrow literally went in reverse and stood still, something it shouldn't do.
Never imagined Matthew Broderick playing a villain character before. Now i see it clearly.
Has anyone else noticed that in every season, episode 11 is always the darkest/most fucked up episode?
You don't wanna end like your mother now, do you? \nholy fuck that scene is spooky
I am really very glad that they explored the theme of abuse in parenthood, especially in this fashion.\n\nJust as B's father tormented her under the guise of being a good father, she tormented BoJack under the guise of being a good mother.\n\nBut it was never about BoJack to her. It was never him being a bad child. It was about her taking out her frustrations and anxiety on others. It was about her making sure that everyone was just as miserable as her. And lo and behold BoJack took out those frustrations on people he cared about. Not because he thought any of it was right, but because it was normal to him to be this way.\n\nBecause remember: abuse doesn't have to be physical at all. Emotional abuse can be terrifying and ugly and nobody would even know it was until it was too late.\n\nAnd the both of them just couldn't admit it because why would they? You can't do a whole hell of a lot as a child against your parents.\n\nDoes this justify their actions? No, of course not. But it does paint a clearer picture as to why they are this way.
the cycle of abuse is real as fuck
What's the song that was used in this song?
Scenes like this just remind me that few people are just born cruel. Most people that are cruel are broken over time.
This episode was almost horrifying at some points
Just watched the fourth season.\n\nAnd i gotta say this episode eas really sad and strong. I ve never seen something like in that in television, the deep and realistic things. Sometimes we met a person, or live with one we may not like and we may not be aware of their past and why the person nowadays does what he does....\n\nAlso...\n\nThat scene when she get bullied for being kinda fat explains why she ended up intoxicating Hollyhock...\n\nThis is so real. And i think the writters really got heavy on the subject...\n\nLike, theres no aesthetics or glamourized story. They putted reality on it.
bojack horseman explains the cycle of abuse so well... the parallel between joseph and beatrice then beatrice and henrietta is fucking heartbreaking
This episode was so good.
Wait, I thought Evil Morty was coming back this season?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh shit wrong show
This show had never made me cry, but this episode got me good
This scene literally made me hyperventilate and weep at the same time. Dead serious.
I literally cried in that episode.
ANIMATION ITS SO FUCKING GOOD AND THE SCENE AND THE HISTORY THIS SHOW ITS KILLING ME AND SHIT ON MY GRAVE
3:39 it was creepy as fuck
My mother had a diamond like that
This episode had me fucked up on so many damn levels
This....this episode..... *THIS WHOLE MOMENT* hurt me.....the writing in this one just tied everything together...and I love it...but also hate it for messing with my emotions lol
wow!! this is both dark and disturbing
The best part of this and Beatrice's whole story this season is that it feels like it could radically alter the way we rewatch the earlier seasons. And shit, how much we're paying attention to the coffee thing in this one.
this season is my favorite so far. so dark yet so funny and excellent. everything bojack horseman is about.
The animators really went to town with the dementia story. They really outdid themselves with this episode. Best example being the simple hat appearing suddenly after the line hat in hand.\n\nEasily the best animated show at the moment comedy and feels wise. Don't know how they will top this season.
After watching this dark scene and it begs me a question with that pregnant part. How did animals get birth by a either a single furry person and a human person? No animal was born like that and there's only one horse baby got release out by a human woman. I guess that in Bojack's universe has to have multiracial connection between animals and humans. Too bad that Princess Carolyn couldn't get a mouse baby like that.
Gross bestiality shit
No wonder Bojack is fucked.
Title change!
So fucked up
Fucking  spoilers.
really :(
Fuckin damn, this show
2:59 wow simba! What an asshole!
That scar . . .
Bojack Horseman is better than Rick and Morty.
Rick and Morty: This is going to be the darkest season yet!\nSouth Park: We already topped that you bastards \nBojack Horseman:....CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!
Season 4 was lame, 2 and 3 are way better
for as much depth they put into the characters I imagine they pitched all of this Netflix with their response being the Beatrice backstory is way to dark let's ease the audience in with existential terror, drug overdose and taking advantage of a teenage and see where it goes from there
I'll never hear that's a lot of fish the same way again.
so if Holihock is not Bojack's daughter, and her dad doesn't even have a diamond shape on forehead, how come Holihock has a diamond too...
They set up this trailer almost like a superhero film. EDISON V WESTINGHOUSE - BUT THEN DRAMATIC REVEAL OF TESLA, INTRODUCED BY SPEAKING A FUNNY ONE-LINER.
Since when did Doc Strange, Spidey, zod and beast travel back in time to invent electricity???
Should've named the movie AC/DC, get it?\n\n\n\nI'm so lonely...
Benedict? Great!\nEdison? Meh..I'll just pass this one.
They finally do movie from Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure by jbern)))
That background score made it sound like a Bollywood movie trailer.
I'm a simple woman. I see Benedict Cumberbatch, I click.
IM WAITING THIS MOVIE FOR A LONG TIME, BUT WHY TOM HOLLAND BE NIKOLA TESLA . I HOPE HE DONT RUIN THE CHAR
Except Tesla was nothing like that. They stole everything they knew about electricity from him.
Why is Benedict not Tesla.. WTF!!!!!   (/O_O)/
Nicholas hoult ohh yeahh
Nikola Tesla...
Wasn't Edison Deaf!
Cant wait to see
I fix problem for idiots. Nuff said, Tesla is pure badass.
Tesla V Edison: Dawn of Electric
Election like sensitive flood instance cut.
Employ merely hospital cholesterol musical table pink limb alternative.
Tesla🚗🔌🔋🚗🔌🔋🚗🔌🔋 Yes
Wow man Tesla is there ,oh man last entry but epic entry !!!!!!
Oh, what a current!  WHAT A LOVELY CURRENT!
Seems like Edison was enemies with everyone
I see Benedict on the thumbnail--  yep.
So, Doctor Strange and Spider Man go against General Zod. Oh, and Beast shows up at the end.
The guy playing Westinghouse was the guy in Revolutionary Road with Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio- I just figured that out!
Was wondering when Tesla would show up. Wonder how they'll manage to glorify Edison with Tesla in the story, if they stick to telling the truth!
Nikola tesla should have been the main role in the film... Not the cheater edison the plagiarist.
Really was about to give a thumbsdown & a comment on how Edison is a douchebag (check the Oatmeal comic) and then Tesla made an entrance :-)
At last Electrical Engineers will have their moment.... Lol
i love benedict but i'm team tesla here
Reminds me of the Prestige.
First thought: No Tesla. Suddenly... Tesla.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell played.
How about a movie on Nikola  Tesla
Country circuit between visit writer joke violate honor.
Edison's one of the world worst dickheads in history, stealing others ideas and making its own. Nicolas Tesla by example. Fuck this movie. But I still respect mr. Cumberbath
Yes! I love movies with Bendelsnatch Cringleton! I mean Bendersnath Combertash! You know the guy I mean..
So it's a three-way fight between Edison, Tesla and who's the third one.
I got tingles when they announced Tesla...
If it has Benedict cumberbatch I'm watching xx
Isn't it interesting that today we use Edison's DC and Tesla's AC all the time, but for different purposes? Could AC work inside your mobile phone? Could DC be used to power a city? Possibly, but it would be a totally different world now.
Has anybody's reputation been more trashed than Thomas Edison?  I'm not saying it's inaccurate just that there's a surprising amount of media about him being a bigger jerk than Tesla
Tesla Coils can kill enemy soldiers and destroy tanks and will keep you military bases safe...\n\nUnless they damage you power stations.
Didn't think I would like this, Edison been serious crook and all, but nice save with Tesla at the end.
Ahh, Tesla. They caught the good ol' Balkan mentality in the end of the trailer!
Parker? Doctor Strange needs your help to change a light bulb. Oh and to fix the washing machine
If its about Nikola Tesla, then I'll watch it. Edison was 99% hype.
who else here because Tom Holland?
Thomas Edison was a fraud and a thief, stealing other people's ideas and claiming it as his own.
Benedict always has to play a genius doesn't he...
So We have Dr Strange, Spider-Man and Beast will they gonna kill General Zod  ?
Here's hoping the soundtrack will be by AC/DC ...
Anyone tired of Hollywood continuously trying to frame negative ideas behind men who where geniuses at the time? \nMore bullshit, and even though Tesla is a genius,  edison was still years ahead of his time. \nP.s. the people who run hollywood are currently trying to destroy americas legacy of innovation, so keep that in mind.
Edison used Tesla then refused to pay him. Sounds very familiar
I love Thomas Edison, I love Benedict Cumberbatch, but sorry I can't suspend my disbelief to watch Benedict as Edison. And the trailer is not helping.
Stopped the video halfway because I already knew that I'm watching this. Of course my bro-crush on Cumberbatch helped. I mean come on - who else could make the Edison, Westinghouse, Tesla rivalry exciting? (at least on the big screen =P)
I love that Tesla is in it, also the fact that he is Nicholas Hoult.
FUCK Thomas Edison.
They'll say 'aw, Topsy' at my autopsy. #JusticeForTopsy
Did Benedict turn into Pierce Brosnan without anyone noticing?
woah crap. I couldnt recognize Nicholas Hault with the hair and stache. cool
Is it AC/DC ?
Nikola Tesla. No more, no less.
If tom holland is in it. I'm watching it😘
wow i saw a lot of scenes that were copied form others
Can't decide who the winner is... since we use alternating current today and not Edison's direct current...
AC vs DC War
Tesla > Edison
zod vs strange
About time...
FFS WHAT ABOUT TESLA
Magic blend horn bottom accuse store belly etc promising.
Einstein True Genius
Edison is a thieving, lying, piece of shit.
Batman v. Superman for physicists
The curent war was a big deal. I'm happy they make a movie about it. Though the Tesla could have been saved for the theaters...
Telsa was so underrated in US history.  Edison took credit for his brilliance.  This movie looks awesome and its even more awesome how they make Telsa the bad ass of the film bc he was the one who changed the world.
Why can't we have a Tesla movie instead srsly
Quick note, Edison did not invent the light bulb
did just Nicolas tesla tell both of them idiots
long awaiting for this story to be come in movies.....great job
don't tell me an elephant will sing by the end of the movie\n\n\n\n\n\nwell not exactly sing but screech during it's death throws
looks...deLIGHTful...see what i did there?
you can still tell it's his voice even though he hasn't got the accent
Lmfao about 3/4 through the trailer I was like this looks great but it'd be better if Tesla was in it too. This looks phenomenal.
Now there's a movie I never knew I wanted to see
Yet another movie in which our beloved Cumberbatch plays a genius.
Thomas Edison vs Nikola Tesla\nFIGHT!
OMG, Benetfilx Cumbersnatch
AKA \nAC/DC: Origins
Whoo! Yeah! Nikola Tesla! Awesomeness!
same here
First Wind River, starring Scarlet Witch and Hawkeye. Now this, starring Dr. Strange and Spider-man
Meanwhile everyone outside of Murica knows Joseph Swan really invented the light bulb. 30 years later Edison would take Swans design and merely improve the filament.
here for benedicts...
Cool.. ye na h movie

I just think its a little bit sad how all this focus is on the potential danger to Florida (which is terrifying, btw) while Bahamas and Cuba got practically blown off the map and hardly get mentioned at all.
By far the best coverage of hurricane Irma is from CBS4 Miami. For future reference, the coverage could be better if they turn off the sound and keep a large picture of Rudabeh Shahbazi on the screen. That would be a lot more exciting than the boring wind and lack of common sense from the wet reporters.

You are SOOO BEAUTIFUL! And unbelievably strong!! 😩😩😍❤️💙🌹🌺🌹🌺🌹🌺🌹🌺🌹🌺🌹🌸
You inspire me so much. I need to stop worrying about the small issues in my life. I can't even fathom going through what are you have went through and and what you're currently going through. You are an amazing person. Thank you for sharing your story so openly with all of us. By the way your speech has improved soooo greatly since the last several videos. Your family and friends must be so proud of you to see you recover the way you are and how strong you remain even through the tougher times. ❤️ sending so much love your way.
You are such a strong woman and just so inspiring. God bless you!
Court, your speech is getting so much better!! It makes me so happy for you! I wish so badly that you didn't have to go through all of this! You're handling it like a boss!! Hang in there, we love you!! Sending you all the positive vibes, and tons of prayers. <3
Two steps forward and one step back.  It's a tough journey, but you are making great progress.  You have so many fans in your corner, cheering you on.\n\nYour posts are very inspiring.
is anyone else proud that she said radiation?
You are truly an inspiration. Such a beautiful soul inside and out ❤️
I know you mentioned you had the issue with the medication that caused your speech to get a little wacky but I just wanted to say that you really are improving!!!! Very quickly I might add too. Keep it up! You will get where you want to be soon! You can really hear the improvement in this video!!!!!!!!!!!!! 💗
Glad your doing better. We need to get you a Tennessee Volunteer hat though.  Lol. That Tiger hat doesn't go with your background .
That sucks! Glad it wasn't a severe reaction. I also have issues with most meds, so first I try a natural approach and if that doesn't help, I take the meds lol. Not sure what you can do for anxiety, but when I'm really stressed or can't sleep, l use a headache balm from Badger (I massage my neck muscles to help with headaches) and it really helps plus it smells good. Hope you feel better!
Modern medicine, too bad the pharmaceutical industry has been keeping the real cause & cure for cancer hidden. \nDo people even look for natural ways to heal themselves anymore?\nSorry for your plight, please stop the drugs in a controlled way.
Beautiful lady, stay strong!!! Blessings for you
You are my hero.
You go girl!! Love from Canada!!!
Sending prayers that everything continues to go well for you. Beautiful as ever and anyone who doesn't understand can flop. I have to take Xanax and watch what I take with it.
I love u girl and all my prayers go out to you always your so strong and an inspiration to everyone around the world ❤️️❤️️❤️️
THEY CAN TAKE THEIR 6% Chemo remission and shove it up their ASS. MY cannabis oil has been 10000000% better and All Natural and Organic....
You are inspiring. Sending love and prayers your way. New sub, thank you for sharing your journey.
Your such an insiprationn to people going through something like this !! Im currently going thru what your going through and yes its hard but we will get thru it😍😍❤️❤️
please watch my latest video and then do your own search about it\nwatch?v=IMunJYEkbkQ
I just want to say that I've been following your journey for some time now, and although I know some videos are edited, I want to applaud you for how far you have come. Although I've never been in your situation, I couldn't imagine how strong of a person you have to be, and I know that you have times where you get disappointed in yourself, I want you to know as an outsider how grateful I am of to share your story and to let other who are going through similar events that they're not alone and that we cannot allow these events in our life to stop us from doing what we love. So, from the bottom of my heart thank you!!P.S sorry if I seem like I am rambling, I just want you to truly understand how much of an amazing woman you are!
: : I have an allergic reaction to anti-depressants so in order to sleep well I take gabapetin (seizure medicine) which doesn't effect hormone/chemical levels but more neurons to sleep well at night and reduce anxiety. It is the only medicine that doesn't have an adverse reaction for me like you mentioned. I totally get it. I'm still thinking positive thoughts & prayers for you.  ; ): :
I know you like reading comments so I thought id leave you a sweet one! You are such an inspiration and one of my favorite youtubers. We can tell that you love what you do and im so proud of you for beating this cancer! Stay strong, ily!!
It's probably the mix with the xannax and the chemo pills.
Keep fighting girl!! You're AMAZING!!!
Every time you touch your chest you get a yellow mark then it goes away! Is that your skin type or a cemo thing? Xo
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Your speech is amazing. Proud of you girl. X
You could try medical cannabis oil and also turmeric as it has many health benefits. If you inform about these things, maybe they can help you.
You should try medical marijuana for your anxiety 🤷🏻‍♀️
Courtelizz1 is the female version of Leonardo DiCaprio
I thought you were going to say that you would not take the chemo and the zanex at the same time. But maybe at least for the year that you still have to do the chemo pills. Hopefully after the year you won't need zanex anymore anyway. Remember to get your support systems going for when you're feeling down. I'm so glad to see you getting better all the time and figuring things out with a great attitude. ;)\nThe only time I ever felt like I was going slow was when I had a high fever as a child and I was delirious too. It was an awfully strange feeling and very scary.
Hey girl glad you're back to normal and your speech sounds great!!! Glad you got things sorted out! Xanax is super strong and does crazy things to a lot of people so don't feel bad! xo
Your speech is amazing in this video❤️it's come on so much and you speak so quickly it's so brilliant to hear!! If you're still feeling anxious maybe you could trying practicing CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) obviously just a suggestion and I definitely haven't gone through anything as traumatic as you but it has really helped me feel better and get my anxiety under control❤️
Hey just found your channel. Much respect for sharing your story. I wanted to extend myself as an outlet to answer any questions you may have about other people in similar situations being helped by medical grade tinctures derived from the cannabis plant. Sending positive vibes and a big hug! Keep fighting.
Good luck to you.  It's a shame Xanax didn't work for you, but good you figured it out so quickly.  As you said, everyone handles meds differently.  I was on anxiety meds throughout chemo and found them helpful, but I guess I was lucky that the particular med I took didn't interact with the particular kind of chemo I received.\n\nI can't believe the jerks saying not to take chemo, or that whatever snake oil they read about on Facebook would cure cancer.  Nobody without an MD has any business telling someone how to treat their cancer.
Your speech is amazing! You are doing so awesome! stay strong girl!!
This is why you should have to get a certificate to have any child...
Thanks for sharing! You are doing awesome!
You are amazing 💗
Please research gcMAF.  It's a real cure for any autoimmune disease.  Just do the research before you dismiss it.  I've known ppl this has worked on.  It's been tested many times.  The only way it won't work is if you've had to much radiation already.  Peace and much love.
Your so brave!! Amazing!!! Be strong and keep up the determination!!!
Chemotherapy = poison to your body.  So yah. It will damage you.
Your speech has got better!
You're speech is so good in this video- you're doing amazing love!! Always praying for you ❤
Cancer is bad. I don't have cancer though or anxiety. Healthy privilege!
Thanks for sharing all your experiences its really interesting! Hope you get well :)
thank you for sharing this! thank you for making us aware about the negative effects of xanax. i also learned a lot from the comments. i have not taken any drugs for my mental health but it's better to know the possible side effects in case i will be needing some mental health drugs in the future because who knows... anyway you're such a strong beautiful girl! i will pray for you! God bless you! 🙏🙏🙏
you are so pretty with out make up and with make up be strong i will pray for you   take one day at a time  that how i live my life that all we can do   much love to you
Your speech is so dang good girl!! You're such an inspiration 💕
ur such a positive person. u give hope to those that need it. My mom is on hospice care from cancer. I love comin to see your good vibes
Omg currently im scared i have a tumor because my head feels fuul an i get throbbing right before bed and just noticed i have a flating dot in my vision but cant imagine yiur situation so prayers and thx for you and your openess!!
Ugh such natural beauty. Why this girl would think she needs makeup, idk! So jelly! :)
I'm also a young person who ended up getting cancer, and I can't believe how strong you are to put these videos out. You're helping a lot of people, and also yourself because these videos are obviously great practice for your speech because it's coming back really quickly!! Hopefully your reading is coming back soon too so you an read all of the supportive comments everyone has left you.
Your speech is actually sounding really good to me!
Have you looked into herbal alternatives to the meds and or herbs and teas for memory like goldenseal and such? I'm only saying because the human body tends to accept herbs instead of rejecting them, like there are natural alternatives to xanax and all ... Maybe worth looking into 😉 stay strong
CBD oil and some strains of marijuana  help with anxiety and may help with chemo side effects.

Omg you poor thing! That sucks
يا رب اشفها 🙌🏻🙏🏻
Thanks for sharing. I've been there, tough, but you're so positive. Awesome.
She's so pretty😍❤️sub if you agree
I regretted clicking on this video immediately after the first minute
Just wondering do you have a po box to send you something?
God has everything in CONTROL! You will be VICTORIOUS IN THE NAME OF JESUS!!
So glad you found out what the problem was pretty quickly! Gosh, your speech and personality are literally sounding 100%! I'm not surprised 💪🏻 but definitely so proud of you!!!
I am curious are you cutting out foods that are known to cause cancer!? have you watched What The Health!!!!!
your speech is amazing in this vid!!! always praying for you
I would highly recommend going to Dr John Bergman then going to Eric Dubay YouTube channels. It could change your life.
does she remind u of the blonde girl from good lucky charlie
Get better 🙂
I have 24/7 vertigo (rocking and swaying sensations) and just had an MRI to make sure it wasn't being caused by a tumor... It is truly horrifying what people have to go through (both young and old) due to medical conditions, some of which people don't realize affects very young people before they even have a chance to live and enjoy life... I am wishing you the best recovery! <3
Wish you the best. Gotta be so hard to go threw, not fair at all.
Glad you are feeling better ❤️stay strong
im with you and my prayers go's  out to you , i have some sored tumor cancer in my chest so is weird
fuck chemo pills, that just gives you more cancer
This is so sad that so many still asleep about how bad chemotherapy is.
THIS IS NOT TRENDING!!!!! FIX THE YOUTUBE WHAT RHE FUCK
So proud of you!!! Your speech is very good. Keep it up ❤❤❤
You make me want to do better...sounds silly I know but your strength is infections.
You are just really awesome!!! To post all of your symptoms and reactions to different treatments is just such a huge help to others who are going thru the same things... you are such a beautiful young woman and I hope you know how truly amazing you really are!!! You are helping so many people and I hope you really know that... you truly are an inspiration!!! ❤️ you...
Too many meds at once is not healthy. Cut everything out that doesn't treat your cancer.
Lol Xanax to help with anxiety? You just wanna get trashed
Sending you love all the way from Iran, you are an inspiration,  you are strong and beautiful.
GOD's got you stay strong
God Bless you 🙏🏻
Love ya <3

Girl I wish you the best , but I must warn what you have been told is not true , stop pills and chemo immideatiy,  and start detox of your body , do not eat meat and vegan diet institute now. Exercise , yoga and you still need light amount of sun , look into tinctures herbal to detox , juicing and raw fruit and veggie diet and you will beat this in a month or two believe these words I speak they are poisoning you and do not continue if you wish to live , this advice is with love , if you love to live quit the chemo on all levels it's not your fault they have tricked and manipulated the population it's a money making , that's it all it is they have killed my family members and dine my research and saved others , look Up DR.ROBERT MORSE ON YOU TUBE HE WILL SAVE YOU YOUR DREAMS ARE TELLING YOU WHAT YOU FEEL INSIDE IS NOT RIGHT GOD BLESS YOU AND PLEASE HEADE THIS WARNING AND THIS ADVICE IT WILL SAVE YOUR LIFE , PEACE AND LOVE TO YOU PLEASE GOD SAID TO TELL YOU THAT THING YOU KEEP THINKING ABOUT ,THAT IS BOTHERING YOU , YOU ARE RIGHT COME ALIVE AND BELIEVE IN YOURSELF NOT YOU AND CHEMO CHEMO IS EVIL ,GOOD LUCK YOU HAVE A NEW  PLAN NOW START  NOW  PLEASE .....!!!!!!!
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DONT DO CHEMO OR RADIATION THE DOCTORS ARE WHAT THEY FIRST SUGGEST WHEN YOU HAVE CANCER WHEN THEY KNOW THE FRICKING TRUTH THEY WANT TO BELIEVE THAT IS THE SOLUTION WHEN THE SOLUTION IS THAT CANCER IS NOT AS BAD AS WE THINK WE CAN GET RID OF IT NATURALLY BY JUST CHANGING YOUR DIET ONLY VEGGIES AND FRUIT AND NOO MEAT AT ALL THATS IT I HOPE YOU READ MY COMMENT GOD BLESS YOU .
chemo is mustard gas and was created by the Nazi's.  It's got a very low survival rate in 5 years, only about 9%.  There are holistic methods that have a much higher survival rate.  The medical industry does not want you to find out about natural therapies, b/c it's all about profits for them.  Look up the youtube video channel Chris Beat Cancer and find out the truth. Most doctors would not do chemo. If you look up info on youtube you will find that people cure cancer holistically. All cancers are due to toxins in the body.  The mainstream medical system is clueless. You need a naturapathic M.D. that can do vitamin B17 and Vitamin C IVs.  Chemo is a toxic poison and you can't get rid of toxins in the body with another toxin. Ask your doctors what the cause of cancer is, they do not know.  But, naturapathic M.D.s do lab testing and know the cause of cancer is toxins.  Look at your food labels and wonder why there are chemicals in foods, where do you think that goes when you eat it.  There is a reason why the food and drug admin are working together.  Profits from poisoning the population, is big bucks.  You can get rid of cancer by detoxification using herb, essential oils, juice fasting etc. A Naturapthic doctor can help you. Look up Dr. Robert Morse on youtube.
I'm glad you're doing ok. However I just wanted to mention that chemotherapy does not work. 97% of the time patients taking chemotherapy do not get better and they relapse. When a person has chemo inside their body they are killing all good living cells including healthy probiotics and bacteria that keep you functioning and that promote good digestion and other things. Chemotherapy is literally putting chemicals inside of your body to try and kill cancerous cells. If you want to read more about chemotherapy and the messed up medical industry I would really recommend you read The MD Emperor has no Clothes By Dr. Peter Glidden.
Cannabis helps.\nChemo pills sound dangerous.
Hello everyone👭\nSubscribe to my channel please 😎😘,,,,,,,,,,,
Chemo? Thats mustard gas.
that is not the s8 plus but just the s8
Anyone know if they are going to release the larger internal storage capacity versions in Europe?
Maybe wait for the note 10
resolution is for vr........simple as that.....
wait a min.. you have kids?
The music you put in this video is aids. The volume is just quiet enough to make it obnoxious.
Still, if you don't need the S-pen easy pick, S8+ is 350 euro's cheaper
I'll just stay here with my c9 pro
chinese fans want to see xiaomi mix2！
still love my note 4... upgrading time might take the S8 plus. really dont use the pen that much.
Now what? Even this clown is reviewing phones? He basically collected all negative side of it and made a video.\nListen, S-Pen has more precision then a finger. Ask people who used it since the original Note. People do a lot other stuff with it, not just to open apps.\nIf your finger is so small that you don't need an S-Pen. Most of us find it useful. \nFunny when a pc builder review phones. He hated the phone before he even put one on his hand. Just search the August 23rd video when he's with other reviewers.
I am not going to pay over 500 $ for that tho...
5:09 I just realized that I might be racist.
i have a note 4 and its still the best one they made, 4k pictures, never lags, removable battery, 64gb sd card + 32gb hdd, no bixby and some come pre-rooted, its great :P
I love this new style of review video you put out, Linus. :D
It has a smaller battery but many people have uploaded videos showing the Note 8 out performing many other phones including the S8+. \nEveryone has been hating on Bixby but I was blown away after seeing a Siri, Google and Bixby comparison. Bixby is smart and is growing more intelligent every day.
you should stick to computer/it tech rather than phones,,,\nps:dislike for using you friend unfortunate event Austin Evans as a joke or what you thought would be funny....
bxActions still works to remap really well. I have it set as a flashlight button.
Thank you for the honest review, instead of just jumping on the band wagon and saying it's awesome. I have a Note 5 and much prefer it over the Note 8. Samsung also downgraded the camera by 4MP. Note 5 has a 16MP camera! That curved displays are just plain stupid, makes it way easier to break.
OLED, AMOLED, Super AMOLED, Super AMOLED HD - I just wish they had a universal language - this is the first time in years I have heard a Samsung screen be called OLED - most recently the LG V30 - if its AMOLED just say AMOLED why confuse the words jezzus
Well, the Dual Sim is a pretty big deal for some people :)
Soon you'll praise the iphone 8 for no reason ...
They are not gonna change everything for you. At the end of the day it's their phone.  They keep the s pen cause that's the main purpose of the phone and to have big specs..not battery. What do you expect if it does it almost all? And they aren't gonna do everything right away. They did pretty damn good, you aren't getting good speakers right away so calm down, they had other things that were needed more.
Wow this sad af just buy a s8
Nice implimentation of Austin's burned flat :'D
I want this phone just to make masterpieces in snapchat
Something about this review doesn't feel genuine...
I have hands as small as Donald Trump
Did you just wink at me sir?
Now I dnt find something unique in ur videos bro ,,,, 😒 use to be fun to watch ur video
Almost $1000?  I could buy like 500 Amazon Fire Phones for that.
Love your work sir.. been watching you for years now.
Dam was this a note 8 bashing I'm glad when I received mine I love it, and didn't listen to some of yall reviewer's
I'm confused... what wouldn't you give up 200mA hours of battery life for, the S-PEN?   That's nuts.   200mA is insignificant compared to the value the S-PEN brings to the device.
You are tooo harsh on Note 8 \nSpecially when it has all the features which even Flagship phones don't \n. \nThat way you should roast normal phones \nI don't see you harsh on normal phones
Adjust my grip and start writing? What? Dude you sound like a female OMG! Just whining and whining and whining WTF dude! I dont care about Apple or Samsung I'm just saying you nip picked your ass off on this one brother! Oh & there was no Note 7 recall remember?? Soooooo???? Just saying man.
I fucking want it
Wait what?! Linus can 540 kick? O.o well done sir!
Too much knit picking dude. As an all in one gadget. I think this one tops it !
I'm sick of dbrand ads
Note 8 has long lasting battery due to its software optimization
Is that a set or green screen?
Not an impressive review, but then again opinions are what makes the world go-around I guess. If you can replace the s pen with your finger, boy I would love to see that one...lol. The dual camera is a plus for me, IMO. Too much clownish batter Linus,  but then again some people like to be entertained....You missed this one Linus, thumbs down!
Hahaha you are very funny... very bad video... you tried to much to make this video... dislike of course
I like the Note line but this #8. Way crazy over priced IMHO. I also think the S8 is over priced as well. These phones have just gotten too expensive over the years.
Holy cow your entire staff has tiny hands. I'm a 17 year old Asian kid. I'm average height and weigh under 130. My note 8 (got it a week early thanks Best Buy) is perfectly sized for fingerprint. So either I have big hands or you have Trump hands.
Linus, you are like the morning dosage of caffeine I can't get through my day without it. We love you, we need you, we are addicted, don't you dare quitting on us! :)
Wait....Squeeze input? You've held the U11 then!
Fuck. The price fucked this up. This video ALMOST made me buy this phone.
What's with the two sexually ambivalent Asian dudes?
Linus....I personally respect your unbiased option.  I appreciate the review and I wont be upgrading for a few gimmicks
Small penis
Trash talker!!!!
Im fucking crying at that gta 5 mod..
no RBG lighting
Definitely should've been 6 inch. Fail Samsung.
cant find sRGB on mine!
This phone needs @ungripyourphone
Austin's house burnt
shut the fuck up!
Don't you think holding a movie in your hand is a bit of a stretch?
The part when the note 7 was a sticky bomb in gta was funny
Your reviews suck !  did not even heard any tech specs
Mmm galaxy note pro 12.3 or something like that.... not that good at maths but I think that means that the screen is bigger
0:07 wth, i did not know that Linus could do crap like this
My mom has a s8 and the finger print was weird  at first but after 2 days it was normal and weird for me when I use my s7 egde
I was told that if you play a YouTube video on note 8, it won't be in the full screen! It will be the same size as Iphone plus. Is that true?!!
I prefer the Note 8 because i don't really like the curved screen on the S8+. Otherwise it's basically the same as the S8+. Think i wasted my money but whatever
Remember IPhone Users... if it wasn't for Samsung deleting the home button, there wouldn't be a Iphone 8
can't ask for more, this phone is perfect\nfor the artist, jot an idea or painting everywhere or even serious work with a smartphone are great,\nbut other manufacturer didn't even take a glimpse on bringing the digitizer stylus to smartphone\n\nI didn't even ask for that dual camera and that zoom\nbut the idea of jot some semi-professional photography idea straight from the phone are like a Christmas gift\n\npeople are bullying the idea of having an active digitizer on a smartphone,\nbut just respect it, many people are willing to pay 1000$ and more just because the idea of getting productive everywhere,
Still can't wait for the Pixel 2
I agree with Linus!  I have the s8 .I say Samsung should just add an s pen and dual camera to it. And put some stereo speakers too! There's  nothing special about the note 8 except that's it's as big as a buiding. I need to also say Bixby sucks .

Now THIS is the type of content I want to see; serious, but with a hint of humor, no flashy stupid milenial memes across the screen, and an organized point-by-point format with comparisons to past hardware.  WELL DONE.  If you can keep this up I'd be happy.
I don't care mate, I'm getting the phone because it's a better Note 4 and I love the Note 4. Simple math mate.
Wanna hear a samsung galaxy note 8 joke?\n\n\n\n\n\nthe price....
Now I want to watch your review on iPhone X and see whether it's going to be as fair as this one
1:32 kiss shot acerola orion heart under blade
Hahhahaha Bixby doesn't recognize iPhone
Garbage review.
(1) In-Screen-Fingerprint Scanner tech (2) Dual Stereo Speakers, etc.
Awesome !

So basically an S8++
$1300 CAD. Haha, what a rip.
If Samsung is gonna take away removable battery, then at least give us a bigger one!
Remember when most of those idiots out here didn't want a Note phone because it was too big? Now everybody wants a big phone. People don't know what the hell they want. Linus just sounds confused. Why is everyone in comparing the note 8 To a phone which most people do not have because they were waiting for the note 8? nobody's going to basically downgrade just for a little bit of battery life. Bullshit review
Already ordered both my Note 8(with Note 7 owner discount WOOOO) and a fresh mahogany DBrand skin to go with it. Cant wait to mail them this S7 Edge and be rid of it forever.
And I'm still here with the Galaxy Grand Prime, Samsung's first x64 phone.
bro u r iphone fan so dont try to compare it with iphone7 plus
Come from taeyeon🖐
Damn! Kelly Clarkson once again proves that she is one of the greatest, and most underrated, singers ever. Amazing song and video.
Came here because kim taeyeon's ig story. Great song indeed! 🤗
i'm here because of taeyeon♥
Thank you Taeng <3
Who came after Taeyeon's insta/story? 😎
why people ain't listening to this beautiful masterpiece !
Kelly and Fergie are back to slay !!!
She is back, amazing as always.. ❤ ❤ ❤
LOVE, LOVE LOVE!!!!  This song is perfect timing! Thank you Kelly for your beautiful voice and talent.  You go Girl!!!!
3MIllion!!!! this song is better than ts . but view are so low ... so underrated song
First time listening!!  I fricking love this song! I predict a major hit for her!
Taeyeon brought me here because of her insta story I LOVE THIS!
Yes and damb she got fatter..but still hot I guess
Is Kelly's body actually big in the US? I just Googled that the average dress size in the US is 16. I'm not familiar with American sizes, but what is her dress size estimate? I don't get why her being big is a problem but I'm just curious why lots of people make a big deal out of it.
i am so sorry kelly. i am huge fan of you but this is not mind-blowing
She got sth in common wit Britney, luv both of them :*
what note did she hit at 2:15 thats so high this woman is legendary
I don't know how I feel about this...
I always love you, Kelly!
This is one catchy song and I love it! Kelly welcome back baby girl.
Fell in love with the song! Now I'm in love with the video! Slay Kelly!
This is the kind of woman who is in the industry every young girl should look up to. Always a fan of her music and her as a person ❤️ #lovesosoft
YES KELLY CLARKSON IS BACK I don't care Kelly Clarkson  buy youtube views from *AUTHENTIC* *Views* *dot* *com*
Yellow suits her a lot
WOW WOW WOW!!!!  KELLY YOU ARE SOOO AMAZING...LOVE THE NEW VIDEO IT'S BEYOND AWESOME!!!\nBJ BROOKS
I watched the video & think it is awesome. Her voice is amazing! Way to go Kelly, well done 👍 Saddens me that so many people are so rude & only focused on her body. Maybe they only watched to body shame...why don't they try again if her body bothers them with their eyes closed. JS
Kelly is back. 90's are back! This song is damn good, bitch! No need sex, booty, etc. To show how music good is. Breakaway kelly! Haha
OMGGGGGGGG I LOVE HERRRR SOOOO MUCH. I love a curvy woman who still can rock her confidence in any clothes. Kelly, you still have that voice OMGGGGGG lady, come by singapore, have a acoustic session with few fans and i'll be there. :) Love so softtttt
Omfg people stop complaining about Kelly's weight ...\n1.she just had 2 kids within the last few years and it might take her longer to get that off. \n2.she is a singer /songwriter not a fucking model. \n3.just because she's not a size 0 does not mean she does not have issues Kelly has even spoken in the past that she has had weight problems and its always been an up and down thing with her .\nStop acting like you are perfect , if you don't like it then go watch someone's else's video , Kelly has many fans who care about her and does not need judgemental people.
People keep talking about how obesity isn't healthy...but models starving themselves and throwing their food up is something we praise? To contribute to what we call body goals???? Smh.
I watch because taeyeon instastory but honestly this song so so good
Kelly was born with a fat Black gospel singing woman in her heart. That girl can SANG! I love this and I'm so glad she's owning her full figure - she's ALWAYS beautiful.
She is the only current successful artist that has come out of american idol it is amazing n she was season one winner. she had two kids bac to bac n Reba is her step mother in law. She is happy n thats all that matters not her weight! She is very talented!
I love how the backup singers actually have representation in the video.
Its saddens me to once again see so much negativity towards Kelly and her weight.  She's so beautiful inside and out.  Why does anyone feel the need to say such things???  When Kelly looks back on her life she will see nothing but love despite her father.  What will you see?  Someone that leads a negative life with judgement,
WOW! \nAmazing and beautiful... I Love it! 👏👏👏💖💖💖👸
Her voice is hypnotizing and awesome since first time I heard it!
wtf..... she looks awful and the song is garbage...
I'm very like this song that I listen to this every day.
Yes im sure her fat rolls are soft
I voted for Kelly on American Idol in 2002!! Always my fav
2017 has been such a great year for music
She should ease up on the makeup. She looks like a clown. Looks like she has lost weight though. Good for her.
starting today i will be addicted to this song till i die!!
Wow the architect of that house
Omg amazing song and video 😻❤️❤️❤️❤️ queen is back finally 🙌🏻😻
This reminds of Nelly Say it right for some reason
WHAT??? THIS SONG AND SPECIALLY KELLY CLARKSON! DESERVES MORE VIEWS!!!!
Yes! The 👑 Queen 👑 is back.
she put on that weight
so good...until the over the top electrical sound affect
Always loved kelly! She never disappoints! ❤️

hahahahahaha
You look adorable!!! 😍
I think they look really nice
aw no peej ur glasses are a+
THE TRUTH IS IN UR FACE
Story time:\n....\nI don't have a story.
I really like the balance of the orange lights in the background . Great slurp!
I love glasses they look just like mine
I love the way you talk about autumn, I relate so hard, I really fucking love autumn
How we know that we aren't all just sentient ice cream? \n\n\n\nAlso,  I'm loving the glasses :)
I like your glasses, they look really snazzy; also good vid 10/10 nice 👍👍👌
I didn't know he could get cuter and then the glasses arrived
How weird am I? HOW WEIRD AM I?! I put glasses on my face. Without any ears.
you look rad with these glasses on
Honestly, you look so much cuter with them on XD
PJ looks so good with glasses😍😍😍😂
I love watching your videos when I'm high af :)
Imagining you in a dark room screaming at a camera a few times to get that shot is priceless
that little laugh after the spongebob joke was so cute and pure
can you smoke human?
im actually happy pj has glasses now. ive always felt weird that everyone I look up to has vision and idk it's a weird small thing
Haha four eyes! I'm so beating u up at skool
My mom at bingo club, my mom's friend at bingo club, everyone at bingo club.
First time I got an ad before a pj video :D
I like his glasses and his hair
Wow, I didn't know dressing up for Halloween had an age limit. Trick or treating, maybe...but dressing up...? Never!
bobo in my language means stupid or idiot.
what the fuck's with the background music?
how does pj look so fucking hot in this video and where can i get a pj for myself
Spent so long trying to figure out what the elephant in the room was and then he pointed to his glasses... I must have seen Pj in glasses before because I seriously did not react at all whoops (slightly disapointed there wasn't some drama scoop but hey I like slurp videos so that's cool)
Bobo is actually me, I dressed up as a pink elephant to hide from the cops
The glasses suit you so well ahhh
Ocerwinner of time that's what o heard pj
Well shoot mate, I'M an elephant. Ellie the Elephant that is
how do you style your hair man i need to know!!!
1:18 You left one out. 🙁 Even hotter than usual!
You look so cute in those glasses PJ! Great video as always. 💙
There's a monster face behind pj, and its made of light. The worst of the worst
I love the glasses
What are you talking about PJ? The glasses are so rad!!!
Hey Pj, I've heard a lot of things about the big rec but I was in a different dimension. Maybe you could make a video about it
Doesn't pj kinda look like the Uk version or cole sprouse??
I was up really late uh.....*long pause* Working.
I think you look really nice in glasses :). Also, that mug is really cool!!
how in the hell are you so adorable
Bobo was great, omg. I really like it when you put in drawings!
0:48 maybe bobo is hiding in your closet because he's boBISEXUAL
IS HE GAY OR EU-RO-PE-AN
pj you looks so good in glasses omg
do you ever drink water out of your mugs and if yes, doesn't it taste different than water from glasses?
You look like Hugh Grant in 4 Weddings 1 Funeral
P,j looks so cute in glasses
Love the glasses, looking great 😍
YES PLS A VID WITH DEAN DOBBS WOULD BE AMAZING
I talked to the wind and it told me to fuck off
I don't know about your country, but in mine, even adults dress up for Halloween, although usually just for parties where everyone gets wicked trashed. Or even just for the sake of dressing up.
Damn, you basically banned all of the terms I was going to use so instead I'll say rad glasses, they really suit you!
Why is this man so perfect?
Anyone else looking for the sentient ice cream in the comments?
you actually look very good in glasses
what?! you should totally dress up for halloween...also do people really make fun of other people for wearing glasses. its not that its unheard of but....i didnt think people still did that.
I have never been more attracted to PJ than when he is wearing his new glasses.
I like the glasses. It makes you look kinda dorky ... Seams befitting to me.
Love this video! I love funny and chill you are!!
Harry who? You're James Potter, PJ.
HEY! Have a good day! And GLASSES ARE GOOD
I like them they make you look better in my opinion
You legit look adorable in your glasses though
Pls tell Bobo he shouldnt feel pressured to come out of the closet. We are supporitve community after all
why is ur lighting so cool
You look like my 9th grade math teacher 🤷🏼‍♀️
You're a spoof. I bet you didnt see that coming.
this makes me want to play zelda and eat ice cream
You are fantastic! I love you and your videos so much.
I want a KickThePj podcast so bad
BRING BACK THE NOODLE SESSIONS PEEJ! :))

They all look amazing. Love this video and song they all slayd this song live.💕💕💕💕💖💖💖💕💖💕
We shouldnt criticize them. Camila was the star of Fifth Harmony so we cant expect that other girls can replace her. They cant sing better songs because their voices are not good enough. They try to be vulgar to earn money for food. They dont want to be hungry.

I love Fourth Harmony. Who agrees?
Write of me video is the Mother of Deliver video,baby deliver was delivered by Write on Me and so it was named : Deliver 💕
I subscribed from different devices
Support the Girls.. They all worked for this album.. And its truly amazing..Go Fifth\n Harmony #Grammys
Cant Camila Cabello join the group again? She has a unique voice and that's what the group need, I miss her (my opinion).
I´m just here because of Lauren Jauregui! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Hi guys, I uploaded a few minutes ago a video about Lauren and Normani! You should check it! You gonna love it!
Their views have decreased so much after Camila left
sounds almost like cater to u
Why aren't their videos getting many views? 😠😠😾👿👿😡😡
💜💜💜💜
my favorite single by their new album so far \nabsolutely loving this one
WHY is Everybody not Talkin' About Dinah ?\nTHIS QUEEN SLAY IT 😍😍😍😱😚
I feel like they're copying Beyonce but song is good
I swear that they look almost like rita ora, beyoncé, amy winehouse and i can't remember the other name :/
I'm so glad that Camila comments have been greatly reduced! Well I just commented about her but this is different 😝😜
Just waiting for a girl group that doesnt do the same as the last, fifth harmony come up with something new
the reason why i'll always be a harmonizer. great jobbbbb~
I love this so much!!! Their music is so awesome! So proud to be a Harmonizer <3
This girls don't know how to make a bad song!!
lonely night should be their next single
In love with their hairs
I already love this Song so much 🎧❤
Have heard like worth it and sleghthamer lauren wasn't singing so thats better because lauren has a better voice than camila and lauren is more in the singing part
I hope these bish learn, do not ever release MV without fans knowing. Tease em! Or it will flop. Fuck Epic!
Y'all im happy for this song but Write On Me is better than this song of all time.
The video is absolute shit!!!
You know the vevo feels like korean IDOL name Wonder girls nobody lol....I love this new song fifth harmony

Lately I've just been so obsessed with Dinah. She's so beautiful and her vocals are amazing! ❤️
Look at Ally's smile at 0:59

Them: Why do they make sexist videos? \n\nAlso them: I dont like this, it's boring.

the song in 4:46 please!! pleaaase
what the first song at the beginning... it's seungkwan voice right?
George Michael was a precious gift to human kind. A musical genius -phenomenal singer, songwriter, composer, arranger & producer. I wish we could have some new music from George but this Remake is undoubtedly a pleasant surprise. Thank you George for the music! Thanks Nile Rodgers & everyone who brought this out!
This is one of my most favorite of George's songs. Miss you George.
the more I listen this the more I like it
So good to hear Georges voice in such a remarkable way ..♡♡♡♡ love it..
This is not a new song. This was a B-Side from 1992.
https://youtu.be/z-TBIQlDv4E
feels like hes back///wow///'who releases his new CD? miss him !!
this is the first time that i feel nile rodgers did a realy bad job. this remake has no energy at all, the drums have no punch, the vocals are so overcompressed, just that funky guitar all over the place. \nthe original was so much more fun, with its rattling drumloop and the weirdo synth-brass. as you could maybe pick-up in videos, george was a heck of a producer and so very much in every detail, he never failed to amaze.
And it is not over, it will surprise us again.\nGeorge we remember you so, happy and not sad. Because you're genial
Fastlove (a draft of original interpretation) or cynical hate&violence expression https://youtu.be/rOAerng9m_Q
Thank you for publicizing this track and making it possible for George Michael's fans to hear what he was working on. I listen to his music every day and I still tear up and cry (when I hear his voice) because I miss him so much. The world is a better place because of GM. I guess the old adage that 'only the good die young' is true. George Michael; a once in a lifetime treasure. <3
Great song
Has anyone picked up anything in the lights in the windows in the buildings?
Miss YOU and Your beautiful voice , it's gonna be strange in 2 Months to hear last Christmas
George has much better tracks than this sitting in the vault.... release them !
I love the original version and love what George and Nile have done with the remix. Listening to interviews etc. he had done during his career, I always got the impression he loved to move forward with his music and wasn't scared to try new things. I particularly loved, towards the end of the recording, when he does that little petulant sigh after he sings the line I may be in the next state; so clever, so Georgex
10006th time. I can make you happy if only for a while

Really LOVE fantasy, it's fantastic,  wanna dance,dance, dance.😘
Fantastic song and fantastic new mix/release
Great tune! Miss GM so much :(
GREAT JOB NILE!!  I love this song.  It was good to hear George's voice again as well.  Hopefully some new stuff will be coming soon.
Is this a newly discovered vocal found in the vaults of his past recordings, or is it a reworking of his vocal from the original track from the '90s?  If it's a reworking of the original, I'm not a fan of how, at different points, they messed with George's vocal on this compared to the original. His voice sounds less robust, and, when he hits the Fantasy high note his vocal sounds a bit more coarse and not as clear as compared to the 90s version of Fantasy, which, I must say, I like better.
I love it this new version ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
I love it!! Tank you M. Nile
Like this version better. Glad I'm not hearing obnoxious horns in this one.
Love it. Funky track. Love you George ❤
Just makes me feel sadder....Sounds nice but like it should be on Faith....Would rather George was alive and making new songs.....But thank you all involved for this....x
Good production, not sure that's how George would have done it, but good anyway!
Is this love or invention...............?
...and David Austen...you're a star...no wonder Yog loved you so much... And Yioda and Melanie thank you for allowing us the pleasure of listening to new George...a true beautiful Greek family xxx
Thank you so much to Nile, David, George's family & team for this. When hearing this I felt a liitle bit of the excitement that I used to feel with each new George's recording. But it's not the same.  I know music is here to enjoy and that was George's intention but my heart is still heavy... I need more time. Well, I will place an order for the LWP & MTV Unplugged though... I have them on cassette and VHS only :-)
Can't get enough of this.   No one sings it better than George. Miss you so much  😢👊💥❤🌟 this is GOLD
Sorry to burst your bubble, but this is an old song re-recorded with a Nile Rodgers riff added.
Very different but good! Thanks Nile. George's voice is like gold. Missing and loving you always. 😚😔
Guilty feet have got no rhythm.
Guyz if you want, go to listen my song https://youtu.be/PJfgmqCaHE4
The druggie back-doorsman ate himself to 398 pounds.
I love it more each time I hear it ... and I was already a big fan of the original.  It's got me grooving at my desk.   Thanks, Nile!
Miss you George Michael u made me who I am
Sounds like remixed cr@p to me. I had thought that Nile Rodgers would have been able to do more with this old mediocre 'B side'. Are they going to release any of these 3 new albums we've heard of?. \nOr else, release 'Love is a losing game' or 'Russian roulette'. Those tracks weren't on the live Symphonica album.
wonderful, wish we had some visuals too...love that man! Sexy George bring it on!
I love you so much, George! I miss you so badly...
I 😍 His Music #HardDay much love Sexy Grandma Darkness✌❤❤
Such a sad loss. My personal fav was Cowboys & Angels, a quite stunning song with headphones on in a quiet place.
RIP George........gone but never forgotten
☺
God, I miss him!!! That voice!!
George Micheal is dead... this is so creepy I'm scared 😢
I miss you George!!!!!I love you Forever!!!
I've followed George Michael's career since 1984 .In the early days I bought every release on 7 inch for the house and on cassette for my car.I remember buying waiting for that day when it was released and after playing it I turned over to the b side to play having never heard of fantasy.I remember the first 3 clicks of the song before it kicked in.the first thing I thought after the first hearing was,what a waste for a b side.this would have hit no 1 no problem instead of the no 23 which waiting for that day reached.I'm so pleased it's finally reached its audience and showed how awesome this man was.is this as good as the original.No,but there's no dance track that every will be,but this new version is still stunning.Why? because it's George reminding us all how nobody could write,produce and sing like him.I miss him terribly and I'm so thankfully to his family,Nile Rogers and David Austin for putting this out and showing all these so called pop stars how it music should be done.Thank you for saving my life through your music George.R.I.P.
Love the original better. This version is ok? ☺️
Wow!!! George at his best.  Gone too long. x
Niles on Earth and George in heaven. Beautiful. Evocative. Sad.
Love the song, love the artist, love the man. LOVE THE SPIRIT!
what a pity not to hear George again live
❤️❤️❤️
missing Yog!!!!

God bless... another telant gone...x

George Michael tinha esse dom! O que fazia e criava, era um êxito! Aqui está a prova! Grande som. Adoro!!!
I'm so confused he passed away how can he write a song like WHAT
Ehm... why is George's singing clipping? It's not like that on the original -87 version. You ruined it :(
Goes to show you can't polish a turd. Don't like either version.
This is so damn good.... Number 1 hit and if not something is wrong
George's voice is on point, flawless but that mickey mouse voice is annoying.

You should decorate Rachel's room from Rclbeauty101
When you make Liza Koshy cry that's how you know you're good. The room looks bomb af.
Liza Liza 110 110 you know that
Actually, about the room...
I have always loved your Office in the Hollywood Home series. This is my new favorite!
The designs in her room look a little... scandalous
This is amazing im not going to lie
I NEED his shirt..Please. Where is it from?
It was so beautiful seeing how Liza reacted to the 2 rooms and it literally made me cry. I love her so much!! And I would also really like to Mr. Kate to come over!!!
Does she actually leave her gum on the floor or were they joking 🤔😂
this gave me so much inspiration for transforming my room! (also i work at target and i recognize a lot of the pieces from there ;))
Love your design in this room! Looks great!
Yes WE ARE so jealous Liza...\nExcellent job Mr. Kate
Away, away\nI love you like you've never felt the pain, away\nI promise you don’t have to be afraid, away\nThe love you see right here stays so lay your head on me\nLittle do you know\nI know you’re hurt while I'm sound asleep\nLittle do you know\nAll my mistakes are solely drowning me\nLittle do you know\nI’m trying to make it better piece by piece\nLittle do you know\nI, I love you till the sun dies
U GUYS ARE SO SWEET! :D
Where is joeys shirt from? \nPlease say it's somewhere I can get in the UK!!
The room and the office are so amazing and inspiring! And I LOVE Liza's reaction :D You guys give me so many awesome and beautiful ideas, thank you for that! <3
Since logan paul is buying a new house , why don't you guys help him decorate it 🤔
Those butts look like pairs of balls.
It was very presidential\nSO you faked it\n\nLOL
If you want to talk follow me on Snapchat @melissa_mar12
I literally cried all over my cat when Liza cried 😭
Wait Liza has a sister!
You need to do Meredith Foster!
This is one of my favourite room transformations ever! You did such a good job, Mr. Kate! :)
I swear she looks like Halsey
I'm happy Liza's happy.
Maybe Logan Paul's house next time..
The office looks amazing! I wanna work in that office! And seeing Liza cry, made me cry!
LIZA HAS A SISTER?!?!

La presse a tué Serge. Ce n'est pas un mauvais garçon, loin de là. Bonne chance pour la suite Serge ! 💪
joueur sous estimé par les supporters du psg...une vrai bête ce mec...dans le top 3 des meilleurs arrière
Putain c'est moche c'est un bon gars Auruer juste a cause des fdp des medias
Ont nà perdu un soldat un guerrier bonne chance au spurs ......\n\nMontre ton potentiel tu peut largement devenir le meilleur latéral droit
Bonne route Serge t'es l'un des meilleurs
T'as été con Serge, ça a demonté tout ce que tu as fait de bon sur le terrain c'est dommage que tu sois parti .
On est ensemble mon gars la presses on s'en fou concentre toi sur ton foot BONNE CHANCE j'espère que tu reviendra un jour  tu resteras dans  nos têtes
Riolo à trop abuser sur ce joueur
Pourquoi tu fais des conneries aussi la tu la chercher fais pas la victime maintenant
Very strong of him to actually come out and talk of this.
Le meilleur latéral droit d'Europe
Arrêtez avec la presse blabla il a fait des conneries II doit les assumer et c'est ce qu'il fait
On t'aime champion
L'erreur est humaine, le talent ça ne se perd pas rassaisis toi et fais nous une meilleure saison à Tottenham pour clouer le museau de ces rageux
Mdr vous cracher tousent sur lui certes il a fais le con il a fais des conneries il les assumes au moins , le fils de pute de Rabiot a Zlatan on en parle ? Marco Verratti supris avec une cigarette a la sortie de son Cayenne on en parle ? Arreter vous Aurier est dans le top 3 des meilleures arrières droit d'Europe il a tout écraser en Champions League l'année derniére , Bonne chance en Premier League Serge ya du niveau et des guerriers la-bas ;)
Meilleur DD d'Europe
Auriez pour moi c'est le meilleur
Great to watch. Thanks for sharing this with us.
Faut arreter, c'est antero et emery qui l'ont mis sur la liste des transferts, lui voulait rester
La famille!
Force et honneur 💪
Courage Serge tu seras mieux ailleurs
COYS !
il a décidé de partire lol t'avez plu ta place a paris c tous Bon débarras tu fera des live periscope de l'angleterre
un vrai guerrier serge merci pour tout se que tu as fait pour le psg😍😍😍 et bonne chance au spurs et continue d être un guerrier sur le terrain tu va nous manquer 😭😭
Aurier va te jeter à la mer
Il est fantastique il est plus que gentil et en plus il était bon le PSG a perdu quelqu'un de grand
revien vite ! :)
stop dire que les médias l'on tué, il s'est tué tout seul, c'est pas les médias qui lui ont mis un flingue sur la tempe et qui l'on forcé à bavé sur le club et sur LB. Si tu craches dans la main de celui qui te donne à manger c'est que tu n'a aucune estime de toi, c'est LB qui ta sortis de Toulouse pour faire de toi un grand du PSG, n'oublie jamais sa, et si le club ne t'a pas vendu direct, c'est juste pour ne pas perdre de billes, mais le lendemain de ta vidéo périscope tu ne faisais déjà plus partis du projet, tout dans les jambes rien dans la tête, j'espère aussi que tu t'es débarrassé de ton (faux) pote a chicha. \nVraiment dommage pour toi et ta carrière, prends ce nouveau départ comme une chance et arrête les conneries t'es plus un gosse!
Waaawww il a les cils hyper recourbée
désolé Serge,après la chicha,tu as perdu le respect du coach et ton niveau footballistique
Bonne chance frérot.....\nQuitte ce pays de fâcheux
Bon débarras !!!
c'est toi la fiotte maintenant 😂😂😂
Bonne chance Serge dans ton nouveau club tout le monde fait des conneries je te souhaite le meilleur et beaucoup d'apèzement
T un monstre sergio!!! Devient le meilleur latéral du monde tu peux!! Merci pour tout se que tu as fait pour Paris sauf l'épisode snap !!!mais deviens le monstre numéro 1 allez bon courage à toi
Serge aurier le meilleur mgl c'est toi le plus fort écoute pas les gens c'est des fils de pute
Tu dis que ta commence ta carriere ici alors qu'en tu sera a la fin de ta carriere reviens... on ne t'oubliera pas serge
Bonne route Serge, on ne t'oublieras pas..
Aurier the best
Gros débile la vidéo déjà c'est grave t'a manière de parler t dance dans le vestiere tous de que tu fais c'est négatif un joueur cancer comme pogba ou Lukaku par exemple
Le plus lent à mettre ses chaussettes aussi ..... mdrrrr \nOui bon joueur , mais pas pro sur le reste , attitude , comportement ...... tkt tu ne \nManqueras pas à Paris
Pourquoi tu les as insultes aussi
tu deconnes serge,tu multiplies les conneries(insultes d'arbitre,insultes de l'entraineur,temps de changement plus long que ma gd mere,que tu partes de paris pour te faire oublié,c comprehensible,mais partir au spurs c pas ton niveau                                                   tu merites plus haut,j'esperes te revoir au club plus mature
Pas envie d'écouter ta plaidoirie... fallait juste fermer ta gueule et respecter le club qui t'a permis de devenir ce que tu aurais pu être. À mes yeux ,t'es qu'un con qui pense qu'à sa gueule. Joue au tennis mec! Quoi qu'il en soit tu va pas nous manquer, casse toi et j'espère que ta carrière sera merdique ✌🏻
il aurait du venir à l'om
Le mec s'est mis dans la merde tout seul.....Insulter son entraîneur, des coéquipiers c'est ça sa conception de la liberté? Et pourtant j'aime beaucoup ce joueur mais il a fait n'importe quoi.
Ptdrrrrrrr mais on s'en blc frère, arrête de faire la victime tout le temps. Miskin c'est jamais de sa faute 😥
Merci Serge et bonne chance la presse française est raciste quand tu gagne t es Serge et quand tu déconnes tu deviens un noir de banlieue
Lex you should do Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre! That would be so awesome!

That's look sick. You should try doing your take one the movie IT. I'd love to see that. 😁
This is the one look you've done that really doesn't look like you anymore. You were talking and it was so bizarre.
Has anyone seen that weird video of a guy who put mash potatoes on his entire face and hair? Well that's what she looks like around 6:00😂
When you were placing your head piece you actually looked like Gwyneth Paltrow i don't know why ❤❤ i love you #Lex

Don't *bee* scared ;)
No American talk show host can touch Graham Norton!
Notice how borring it was when Graham came out, atleast on Grahams show he is so energetic from the word go lol
Anyone who hasn't seen the Graham Norton Show should take a look at any of the very many short excerpts available here on Youtube (TIP: click on any GNS interview with Miriam Margolyes: his best guest and one of the most outrageously funny story tellers you'll ever see.)\nYou will also immediately see why his shows are so successful and just how good he is. The format for a start (Graham in an armchair with three celebs on a nice sofa) is completely different from the typical US talk show which always looks like an office: a large table with the host seated on an office chair looking like he's about to give a job interview! It's dire and so out of date...
England is my City...
The greatest democracy in the world. Ugh, American arrogance never ceases to amaze me. 123 of 192 countries on this planet have a democracy. How is your any greater or less? I put those comments in the same box as land of the free, a lot of other countries are, too, free, if not moreso.
American late night talk shows definitely could learn a lesson or two from Graham Norton.
Graham Norton shows how its done, its like he takes this show over. He is a burst of life..
I really liked this interview even tho it was a little awkward at times but im glad graham is getting the attention. he really is a great host, and if you watch his interviews you see that not only is he genuinely really funny but he doesnt ask the same old questions that hosts tend to ask.
I freaking love Graham Norton!! He is awesome and his talk show is great!!
He almost brought up Matt Damon! 😂😂😂 I think they got a sharp looks from producers. Don't bring that up!
He is so charming, I love this guy.
Roddy Doyle needs to be on here graham is an embarrassment and a crap personality
Graham Norton's probably the GOAT in the way of talk show hosts and so many Americans have never heard of him
Yep we'll see just how wrong you ignorant people are when Trump not only wins a second term but actually makes America better than before. But of course you'll just keep acting as if his approval ratings are low (which is a lie if you did fair polling it would've been higher) and probably make some new shit up about how he won because it just can't be because people agree with him now can it? Stopped watching Colbert regularly since he just talked Trump every damn time. Comedy show hosts have become like the rest of hollywood, unoriginal boring and washed out
Graham is the best host ever!
Graham is also a good interviewee. I'll get the book as my simple way of saying Thanks from afar. Your interviews are certainly entertaining.
I have seen a lot of talk show hosts but nobody is better than Graham..!
I think Graham Norton's one of the most entertaining show hosts.
Graham Norton is the best talkshow host in the world, because he can put guests at ease and have them doing and saying things like no other show.
I love when Graham asks why Dump's poll is not zero yet.
I love that when Stephen says You give them alcohol?!, it is basically confirming that he has never seen the show before. All of his compliments prior to that immediately became redundant.
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS DAY FOR SO LONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11
its really weird seeing him on the other side being interviewed. He's sitting awkwardly because he doesn't know how to answer questions lol
I love his shirt/pocket square combo! Is that Alexander McQueen? Awesome!
Graham and his show are just soooooo much better than this twit Colbert, in every way.
Stephen Colbert seems like a ball sack
They also have Theres May. Totally incompetent and just like Trump, visited disaster site without meeting the victims.
he forgot the best of all he played fr noel furlong
TGNS is the only late night show I can stomach to watch now, since Craig Ferguson went off the air.  I've always had a bent for British humor though.  Both their interviewers have always had a much more organic and relaxed feel to them, mostly because they don't conform to the traditional staple of questions suitable for US network television.
one of the popular tv personalities in the uk? stephen he is the only tv host worth mentioning. the other one is a blabbering idiot jonathan ross
Father Ted
That sandwich analogy was perfect.
The greatest American talk show of all-time was The Dick Cavett Show. Guests drank, they smoked, and they talked about literally whatever they want. Sometimes, guests had nothing to plug and went on just because they felt like it. Even though his show is more celebrity-oriented, Graham Norton's show is the closest thing to what Cavett was doing. Once they get the plugging out of the way, that's when Norton starts having fun with guests (of which there's a real variety of talent), and they love him for it. Colbert is fine -- unlike Fallon, he can actually conduct something resembling a conversation -- but his format and his attitudes are much more conventional. Colbert presents himself as a good liberal but his corporate masters would never allow the sort of irreverence that Norton's show allows.
One of the reasons why UK talk shows are so much better than American ones is that they have several guests on at a time, so that they can interact, which contributes far more to hilarity than just one guest and the host talking!
3:03 What the hell was that supposed to be? Spamming musical ques like it's fucking Leno.
This short excerpt from the Graham Norton Show shows why he and the show are so popular. You'd never see guests talk like this on US chat shows:\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=H9_7wwgd1Fc
The fact that Stephen asked Graham if he really offer his guests liquor proved that he has never watched the Graham Norton show nor did his homework as any interviewer would do. Asking about how to get guests to interact in a show is exactly why Stephen should be watching Graham's show. He can learn from Graham how fast and relevant and humorous his response is. Unlike Stephen who is always and only know to bitch about Trump on his show. Stephen comments and response are almost always boring and uncreative. Unlike Graham who doesn't need to make offensive and rude remark on anyone and yet is almost always super funny and insightful. I can continue to make the comparison but I shall stop here. Point is Stephen Colbert is boring
Graham should sub host an American late night show. He really knows how to work a couch, it's like watching ordinary people have good chinwag at a party with the most outrages stories! I fail to recall an episode I didn't like. Love ya Graham 😘
Graham is infinitely better than Colbert
But why aren't they zero? Hahahahahahahaha. Love you G.
Lol, shooting fish in the barrel is Colbert's entire shtick.
He is a National Treasure😂😂
Hey it's Graham 👍
Can this cunt go JUST ONE INTERVIEW without mentioning Trump???? You're a damn good interviewer Colbert but the constant political yammering is ruining late night!
Graham Norton is my current favorite host, it used to be Craig Ferguson but he quit e
This is so weird to watch xD Two different words collid
It's pretty fucking funny how Graham is subtly insulting Stephen, especially about his useless comedy writers and shooting fish in a barrel.
Hands down, Best Host Ever! Definitely setting the bar high. I admire how he makes every interview with his guest enjoyable and fun. It shows, but many have also commented that they genuinely have a good time on his show ☺️👏
form i like  this one!dejply  force  .
Stephen can't stop talking about trump. It's getting booooring🤣
Can that fucking fag Colbert go one minute without bitching about Trump?  What a fucking ass clown.
He farts @ 4:56
Rocket museum candidate pdbfl reputation suburban count slight tunnel last animal.
Much love to Grahamxoxo

Love Graham!
Graham is funny, Colbert is a Douche.
love this man
From Ireland though
Good job Graham!!
Entire interview merely illustrates how banal and unsophisticated Our television hosts and the entire fucking audience is. Graham Norton is dropping joke after joke with acerbic, dry, classically British humor brimming with pointed wit and gets crickets.\nWe as Americans have taken obtuse to a whole new level.
Who tf says rick-uh-luh it's ree-cola
Graham Norton is the best.... he's so causal during this that it seems almost wrong! He needs a glass of Chardonnay and some question cards in his hand!!!!!!
Graham's show is all about having fun. That's it. It's just a fun time with celebrities and the audience. It's pure gold!
I miss Jon Stewart. Does this guy even have a sense of humour ?
AMERICANS HAVE NO IDEA WHO GRAHAM NORTON IS.
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeees!\nThis beautiful British bastard!!!
Graham!!!!!! I saw your face and I could click fast enough!!!' When is your show coming back on!??!!!!
Graham Norton, the best host ever! Those US boring and rude hosts have nothing on Graham.
i feel like every stephen colbert interviews goes like bla bla bla chit chat yeah that movie right?and at some point *HOW ABOUT TRUMP THO?*
Graham is one of the greatest things to happen to TV!
Love Graham my favourite tv host
Norton's show is the best chat show of all time simply because there's several a-list superstars at any given time and no censorship. They can swear as much as they like and he's the funniest interviewer.
Grahan Norton is 10 times more famous than Steven Colbert around the World. And clearly is one of the best talk show host ever
*......Ask him about how he feel about James Corden stealing his show format!*
This video really outlines the differences between European and American talk shows. In America, the host is very controlling of the conversation, and its more like a job interview than a talk. In Europe, it's like a casual conversation, with the host asking a few questions every now and then, but otherwise letting the guests talk how they want.
ugh such poor form for Stephen to show his own book - even if the intention was for some dumb humour. you can tell he just knows Graham is in another league and his ego can't take it.
The greatest Democracy in the World \nI have rarely laughed as hard...
2:14 You could feel the brief awkwardness filling the room.
Why aren't the ratings zero? That is a good question.
I like Stephen, but Graham is a far better host.
Ride the bomb all the way down like Slim Pickens in Dr Strangelove
steven is so out of his depth compared to graham.  Norton rules
greatest democracy in the world?
theres 4 countries in the uk not just england
This is an interview I never expected, but I'm glad it happened.
The best American host meets the best British host.
Graham Norton is a National Treasure. I adore him!
He's not kidding about the alcohol. All you have to do is google drunk on graham norton show
EVERY SINGLE tv host in the U.S should learn from Graham Norton.He makes everyone relaxed and laugh and have fun.It's never boring.And yes,the guests drink whatever they want...Why not?
This interview/meeting is looooooooooooooooong overdue. I am so glad it was two of them. :)
Oh Graham, stop pandering to these liberal morons.
Wow, what about his accent?  Hard to identify where he is from, I have never heard a more Americanized British accent in my life.
Norton's awesome.!
Graham Norton is just adorable!
I love graham nortan
Absolutely love Graham!
Graham Norton sucks on more than a Ricola!... The was he sits and moving and flexing his ass around is a sure fire indication that some other dude butt pirated him!...lol.
Is it me or Stephen Colbert sounds so grudgy and even condescending at times ?
Can someone explain why sand bags are important?
I'd appreciate if you could check out my stuff.\nI quit college to make YouTube videos seriously.\n(My demographic is mostly guys, keep that in mind)
If you have to evacuate, then evacuate. Stop making a big deal about it
512 lol that's like my parents and y'all need a big Halloween blow up
Hi everyone I'm hoping to be a professional YouTuber and a subscription would mean the world to me I'm hoping to get 200 subs and if you help me it would mean the world
You can blame trump for this he paid irma to attack the us so he can get good press
Why are they getting sand?
nobody cares about your life and i hope you die
Charles gained 50k strength XP during this blog.
When I went to every store for D batteries and I say sir do you have D batteries and he said D batteries Deez Nutz where sold out! \n\nThen I found D batteries at the Farm Store and paid 12 Bucks for.4 D batteries.
I live in Tampa and it fucking sucks bc until yesterday they said we weren't getting hit and now we're in the direct path and threw no way we can evacuate and all the shelters around us are full
Praying so hard for you guys right now!! Stay safe!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Saw this trending got excited but remembered it's not the same Alli :(
I want all of Florida to be leveled
Damnnn CTFxC still going strong? I've not watched for years.
Idk if people realized that almost this whole week plane tockets were 2k a pop and traffic as much as 48 hours
Evacuate. Why stay? You staying won't save you from a cat 5
Or make something to destroy the hurricane
Good news. It downgraded to cat 3. It should be a lot weaker now.
Guys stay safe also I got excited because I saw my country in the thumbnail.
This is getting crazy. Stay safe.
Evacuate. Staying back isn't worth it, honestly.
it's sad that you guys have to be hit by a deadly hurricane just get subscribers
I'm thinking about everyone in Florida right now and hoping that everything will be ok...stay safe and strong guys! My thoughts are with you all! 💕💖👍🏼
Shouldn't you be getting to safety rather than playing to YT?
Damn Charles been a while ur getting old looking and ur looks starting to fade
Why would you have to shit yourself?
Are your parents no longer together?
o let's cry about it 😭
Look up windy.com gives a live update an map of the world n weather.
What exactly are the sand bags for???
3:00 Charles as such a kind heart.  5:18 Gotta be that guy, but his name's Ghost Rider lol.  Most of this vlog shows much of a heart Charles has and it's fantastic :)
I fucking hate thumbnails like the one on this video.
That photo won't be from the space station, it's a lot closer to earth than a lot of people think! More like a really, really high flying aeroplane. Anyway, doesn't matter, it's an incredible image, good luck guys, stay safe, we're all think of you! xxx
He really likes the name Allie lol I haven't watched in a few years but there is a Different Allie now
Boi dat passed thru Puerto Rico and it didn't do anything. Everyone is over reacting. Well no but prepare and it will be fine.
Praying you and your family will be safe.
Ran out of sand?! LOL!! It's Florida!
Is he not uploading everyday anymore? Havent watched since the last allie lol
Keeping you all in my thoughts. Please be safe
It's to late to leave noe
It's weird but also interesting to see someone's point of view through the whole process of the situation
Wonder how bad it will be
🤣🤣🤣when I looked at the thumbnail I was laughing am dead cringing at the same time🤣🤣🤣 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️\nPPPSSSSSHHHHHH
Tape is horrible for your windows
Omg the sound effect when Marley was running! 😂😂😂😭
Don't forget your baby food
As someone living on the east coast, I feel bad for hoping the storm turned west more. I was planning on evacuating to Tampa, but that all changed today. Everyone saying “don’t be dumb, evacuate.” It’s not that easy. There are only 2 main highways that go North through Florida, and if you’re trying to leave the state, good luck hopping off and refueling. Last thing you want to do is run out of fuel on the road when the storm is coming. This is the bad scenario with FL, when a storm affects both coasts. There’s nowhere to go but North.
Dude just get out of there
What city do they live in?
Just dropped by to dislike for that dumb ass thumbnail.
please at least find cardboard for windows. They say tape isnt a good idea because if the window breaks youll have larger shards that could fling back out at you.
I say stay and see what happens. You've got plenty of dirt. Might wanna grab a poncho just incase though. It might rain.
dont be stupid leave now... there is no we might you will die if you stay  especially on that 2x4 built home....
Where I'm living now doesn't get Hurricanes, but they say we're long overdue for  a major quake!
Why aren't people subscribing to them. They've been at 1.4mil for like 5 years already 😡
An update your fucked irma is coming your way with the eye
You are driving for water.  Is the water that comes our of your tap not drinkable?  For the next storm just filter your tap water and have it in large water jugs.  Sorry do not mean to sound judgemental.  We have large levels on magnesium and rust in our water but it passes all tests from the hospital lab.  We tap off when a storm is coming.  Wish you and your family the best.
You can come to richmond hill ga stay with and our family we welcome you guys open arms exit 87
I'm in broward.
Taping your windows is a myth. It creates larger shards of glass if broken.
I somehow hope you see this, take the tape off your windows it's been proven all it does is cause the windows to break into larger shards of glass just causing more damage to you, family and dogs please be careful xx
You can take some Bass lessons while you wait out the storm .. LMAO
I live in Florida too,  sand bags do nothing when the shit hits the fan.
DO NOT TAP THE WINDOWS !!!NOT SAFE
You look exactly like heath hussar in the thumbnail
Will your ear gauges evacuate as well? 🌊👂
Stay dude I promise you won't die\n\nAnd if I'm wrong, well, ya can't really tell me anything, can you?
why does nobody cate about whats happening in burma !!!
Lol, westbro saying god is punishing you for voting Trump.
Glad YouTube put this on trending. I was looking you up yesterday to see what you were going through 👀 stay safe Charles!
Your entire state is fucked!!!! Lmao later Florida!
taping your windows does absolutely nothing
taping your windows litterly does nothing
I whas scared of hurricane dineo
Don't  bother,
dude tapping the windows actually makes it worse
Dirtbags....
Gtfo!
Enjoy the ride
MMMMM FUCK💦  HORNY AF?  OOOOO SHIT FUCK MEE TILL I CUM💦💦💦🔥🔥🔥😰😰 AND JERK OFF ..💦💦💦💦💦💦💦🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍😘😘😘😍😍😍😍FUCK ME😍😍😍VIEW ME😍HURRY😍😍😍FUCK HARDER😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍FASTERzxx
Boo fucking hoo. your life could be 100x worse.
Ooohhhhh mmmaaaaannnnnn
Good luck stay safe
Who Cares
Stay safe
You can use mulch too!!!
Please die
Fuck yo thumbnail
fuk cornyass humans \n#pray4dogs
Stay safe!
Too much praying. \nNot enough evacuating.
#firsttimewatchingyou \nPlease be safe 🙃🙏🏻
DONT DIE!!!!!
😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😕
_We might have to evacuate_\n\n*But not before we make some profit from a natural disaster which has already caused massive damage.*\n\nUS capitalism at its 'finest.' \n\nIly Adblock+.
And one more dude, you are in Saint Petersburg! Your storm surge is gonna be katrina. You are in the bottle opener! You are so close to sea level. It is head more west so it is gonna come up the coast at you. You all need to be expecting more then you act like you are. Get out!
It's sad to see you are just wasting your time, a hurricane category 4-5 can destroy anything and considering you build your houses with wood, you don't have a chance. I will pray for you, but please, if you can leave, just do it.
this hurricane is so overhyped
Wow. Foo Fighters are awesome :D
While most bands get lamer as they get older the Foo's seem to be rocking harder the older they get.
I'm seriously psyched for this release........
Well that was shit
3 days\n3 dias
Stay gold Foo Fighters
Foo Fighters é tão bom caralho
Wow... Just so amazing!
Awesome!
Minha banda favorita. Quanto mais velho, melhor. Exatamente como vinho!
0.75
<3
Missing the pep from originals
Concrete and Gold is a monster.  And it's not's even hit I-tunes or the streets.  Does that tell ya something?  This thing is going to kill the charts.
GG
emotional good song！
Awesome :)
ARGENTINA! ❤
Indonesia wants you!
3. More. Days. I can do this
とうとう今週末アルバムリリースですね！サマソニ挟んで追いかけ続けてきたから思い入れがハンパない！そんな大きな期待を軽く上回る作品だと信じてます！
I love FF, but the mix seems off on this song. Percussion and the rhythm lines seem to drown out Dave's lyrics.
this album will be so amazing
ff keeping it real
ola soy felo jeje
me acabo de enamorar!!!
Bueeeen temaa!
fuck you guys, you are disgusting people
Amei!!!
I think someone listened to fallout boy
Love me some foos
fuc*** great!!!!!!
very great 🎵🎶🎧
Que delicia
three out of three so far
From the 3 songs I've heard so far I like Run the best
301 justin bieber fans ..
I can´t wait anymoreeee Five daysss
fooooooooossssssssssss
Only 6 days left 😂😂😂
GO THE FOO FIGHTERS!!!!
Run , the line 🤘🏻
Esto si que está bueno de sonar el rock actual #QueVengaFooFightersaPerú
Le grand public devrait les reconnaître.  Superbe.
Boring and sounds like crap (for example the Drums / Snare) !
hum... i don't know, i think that One By One and Wasting Light have the face of FF... this songs from Concrete and Gold reminds me Young Modern of Silverchair, doesn't sounds as FF
Their album is gonna be huge I can feel it ! This new producer is really good and Foo's didn't dropped their big raw sound ! I can't wait next friday
A 310 personas no les gusta bombo fica en la musica, disrespect para ellos
This band can do no wrong. Maybe the most consistently great rock band of all time. LOVE
Love, and good vibes forever; waves of them.
Damn I love this band.
awesome song... can't wait to get new album
I love how this album's shaping up. Just 5 days more!!
thanks for being the first song i've heard with 22 years old!!
great song! any drummers out there, cover on my channel!
Comments on Facebook 1,666. Now I am fucking this up as 1667 but shit this is straight from the devil and I can't even listen to this shit
they are coming to australia with weezer (another *awesome* rock band) for a concert 2018, but tickets cost $150
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS RECORD. AHHH
Just hoping for some harder stuff than this in the album...
No me gusta :/ ... como todas las canciones hechas actualmente de rock
HMMMM mixed feelings for this one, kinda meh to me. In Your Honor vibes, definitely. It's a very good song but imo it doesn't add too much to the already existing FF material. I found The Sky Is a Neighborhood and Run pretty innovative, I really hope I'm getting more surprises when the album is finally released :(
Probably the only single I like off the new cd. Hopefully the other songs are good.
Better than Run and Sky combined?
*I was wrong, i was right*
Yesss foo fighters made it to trending! Albeit number 50 but they made it nonetheless.
I'm just here to say fuck that commercial they make us watch with the dog and the Lions mane for Amazon. That song is shitty
The only Foo Fighters album I didn't like was Skin and Bones.The rest were brilliant 👍👍👍
Sounds terrible, compressed to all hell, those cymbals are killing my ears. On top of that it's just very mediocre cookie cut rock music.\nDon't get me wrong I love the fooies I grew up on then to an extent but I just can't keep listening to the same old stuff. The album art is awful too. Nothing new here.
If you come to Spain I will be watching you at first row singing every single song of your new album, because it's going to be AMAZING
Anyone else think vocals should be a bit louder?
It's a no brainer I'm really going to get into this track more!!! Later on but can't wait for concrete and gold
283 people can't find the line.
When you forgot you used to play tourettes in your other band...
Everything on this album sounds amazing. The only exception for me is Sky is a neighbourhood, but I feel like that will be better live than on the album.
This album is going to be epic! I have got to say this song it's probably my most favorite Foo Fighters song in their whole history in my opinion!
Don't judge people. We haven't even heard the song yet. Fuck man. Everyone is so quick to throw the term sell outs onto this. The Foo's have had a long enough career and have written tons of great material. As a long time fan, I trust the Foo's. You should too.
The best part was from 00:00 - 3:39
i think 500k of the views are from me
This solo is AMAZING
I sense this going to be a great album after there is nothing left to lose
holy shit this song is just amazing
Listenning to this..... this album is gonna be perfect
Now I understand why FF has three guitarists
How do these keep getting better 😂😂😂
What a good song. They never cease to amaze me. Thank you foo fighters for staying true to yourselves. I believe it is what makes you guys so successful.
This song has got power
(Lyrics) \n\nYes or no?\nWhat is truth\nBut a dirty black cloud coming out of the blue?\nI was wrong\nI was right\nI'm a blood moon born in the dead of night\n\nBreak my bones\nI don't care\nAll I ever wanted was a body to share\nHeart's gone cold\nBrush ran dry\nSatellite searching for a sign of life\nLike you\n\nSomewhere?\nAre you there?\n\nThe tears in your eyes\nSomeday will dry\nWe fight for our lives\n'Cause everything's on the line\nThis time\n\nListen close\nI can't hide\nI'm a page torn from a broken spine\nSun gets low\nI get high\nSatellite searching for a sign of life\nLike you\n\nSomewhere?\nAre you there?\n\nThe tears in your eyes\nSomeday will dry\nWe fight for our lives\n'Cause everything's on the line\nThis time\n\nAre you there?\nAre you there?\n\nThe tears in your eyes\nSomeday will dry\nWe fight for our lives\n'Cause everything's on the line\nThis time\n\nThe tears in your eyes\nSomeday will dry\nWe fight for our lives\n'Cause everything's on the line\n\nYes or no?\nWhat is truth\nBut a dirty black cloud coming out of the blue\nI was wrong\nI was right\nI'm a blood moon born in the dead of night
This is gonna be an amazing album... Can't fight The Foo 👍
Dave Grohl Appreciation Comment:\nif you stop and think for a while you'll realise that Dave Grohl is a fucking national treasure. what a legend. he's been a pop culture icon of three different decades. he's been one of the pioneers of grunge (the last decent music era) and now almost single handedly keeping rock music in the mainstream.with the Foo.  Rock on Dave. you're an absolute legend . that's all.
My band covered some Foos on our channel. If you're interested, we'd love to get some feedback and criticism on our stuff! Thanks
Ez is nagyon jó lett srácok!
¿Alguien habla español?
Just heard the full album and my verdict is a solid 7/10. \nThe vibe is pretty much what you would expect from the Foos. \nMake It Right and  La Dee Da are usual Foo bangers, \nDirty Water has an easy going/beach vibe I kinda dig. \nSunday Rain has a wicked bass on it. \nThe Line is no doubt the track of the album.
GO THE FOO FIGHTERS!!!!!!!!
replay...replay...replay...replay...replay...replay...replay...replay...replay...replay...replay...replay...
Nothing this year that gets released will beat this album.
Even a deaf person could mix and master better than this shit. Fucking loudness war is ruining the music. Fucking crap.
This is the first Foo Fighters' song to actually sound like a Foo Fighters' song since, like, 2005 or something. Thank God. Dave is still capable of writing good tunes every once in a while...
this song is perfect for FIFA
These songs deserve more views 🤘🏼
He opened for Ed Sheeran and ALL his music was amazing! I was really impressed!
Does anyone know if he's going to release more tour dates? :(
So when's tinder online coming ?
I miss 2005
What did he even say at 2:07
🔥🔥🔥
Lmao, I didn't realize how funny he is. Too bad his music's gone down the shitter
Watch me close girls on Tinder. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArBZohPDpmc
How many bowls/candles/coasters/baskets can you possibly need in your everyday life? Once you have a set that's it you're fine, when they break you buy new ones. I'm sorry but this is just pure pointless consumerism.
OBSESSED with your hair and make up at the end. Could you do a tutorial? I'd love to wear that look for work :) xxx
so excited to move out and get my own place so I can start buying home stuff! <3
Ok I need to visit home sense like now! Xx

Hey guys please show some support to a small YouTuber ❤ We would love you to subscribe if you like the content ❤👍
I loved this video 😍 take my 💰 home sense!! I'm in Australia though & I don't think we have those shops here.... We only just got Tkmaxx. Please come to Melbourne home sense! 😋
As a vlogger myself I would love to go shopping with you two. #dreamteam
where is alix's dress from?
OMG go back for the ottoman!! You will spend the rest of your life regretting it if you don't! ITS SO NICEEEEEE
Yes to the ottoman I think Rory and Nala would like jumping on it though :-) loved this video some really nice home ideas thank you ! X
You have to get that blue ottoman xxx
love this haul! really appreciate you stating the prices :) cheers xx
This makes me super excited to move out, I've started to buy little bits but I've got a home sense near me so definitely going to pop and buy a few things!
I picked up those coasters the other day!! I'm definitely going to go to my local homesense and see if I can pick up that plant pot, I love it!!!
No homesense in Holland :( and they don't deliver internationaly. But it would be a lot more expensive anyway going from pound to euro..
Hey! Loved this vlog and all the bits you picked up! How much was the velvet blue ottoman pls? XX
Liked this vlogg alot!! Please do more like this💖💖And get the blue chair from homesense it was soo nice😍💙
Love home hauls and home style vids! Defo get the blue ottoman xxx
Which homesense did you visit? I need to go!!
This didn't feel like an ad at all, really nicely done and authentic! Love the marble coasters. They also do the best candles ever, so affordable!
I need to go to homesense now! Not been for ages but looks like they've improved! Great finds! Btw where is your red dress from? & the red lippie? Matched perfectly! X Deb xx
Your living room is lovely!!
Gorgeous buys! Which Homesense was this Susie? My closet one is around 40mins away and sadly nowhere as nice 😐
Lovely video! I'm looking for some new homewares to jazz up my bedroom, so this video is perfect of inspiration! :)\nAlso, I know you probably get told this all the time, but you and Alix are the definition of #squadgoals - I love both your channels so much xxx Daisy :)\nhttps://daisychaindaydreamsblog.wordpress.com
I loved this video! All I want to do now is shop for home stuff :)
Omg get the navy ottoman it's lush xxxx
I'm going to homesense tomorrow ....they better have those coasters.  I need them in my liffffee! 😍
Love videos with you both!!
Absolutely love your vlogs, you look beautiful with a bright lip 😍😙
Im in love with your red dress and really wish we had a shop like that where I live, everything looks gorg 😍😍
This made me so happy hahahaha <3
Okay, 1) that was the dream girls day! I need to do something similar asap. 😂 2) love your style! That rug is dreamy. Xoxo, caylie
I live home hauls in the US it's called HomeGoods and TJ Maxx both are my favorite
I love your home hauls sooo much! They are my favourite things to watch! Also, where are your glasses from when you were showing us the haul, they are gorgeous!!
Buy the navy ottoman! It will look great in front of your bed and you can put your blankets and cushions in there :)
SUZIE YOU NEED THAT BLUE VELVET OTTOMAN IN YOUR LIFE BABE
I've seen so many vlogs with home sense in them lately and it's making me soooo jealous, I live in Northern Ireland so even though we're in the UK we don't have one.
Home sense is so much bigger in the UK! Canadian ones (that I've been to, anyway) do not have this much selection.
Awwh it's so lovely to see how you're putting together your house- it's looking absolutely lovely, and that home sense looks amazing! I know this might have been filmed a little while back but just thought i'd ask if you know which red lip stick you are wearing on the last clip? It's the perfect shade or even if  anyone knows of one similar it would be a huge help :)
Excellent video! Such an amazing sponsor- wow! Do more like this!
Good evening, I thoroughly enjoy your haul! I love everything you  bought, but my favourite ones are the grey chair and the stool. They are to die for. I live in Barbados. Gosh I can't get over how much I just love your stuff. Do you know if they have a website and if they ship outside England? Thanks and do enjoy your stuff, it's gorgeous. You have excellent taste! Kudos to you!
I just love your style.  your haul videos are my favorite ones EVER..the colour palette is amazing.
Please please how much was the pink velvet chair?? 🙏🏻
Loved this style video and all the bits you bought! Home sense is my fav too! ❤️
Love your tan on body
That homesense in hedge end is in the middle of nowhereee
What lipstick are you wearing when showing the haul? Super pretty on you
Amazing haul!!! Never been to home sense but I am going tomorrow!!
Loved this! Makes me want to go and raid Homesense now. I spied a couple of plasters in this video, are they the new tattoos you mentioned when you got your last two? Great video, your's and Alix's friendship is major friendship goals and reminds me a lot of my friendship with my best friend xxx
I love all the things you found in Homesense!  I'm from the US and I have a TJ Maxx and Homegoods (same as TX Maxx and Homesense) right next door to my house and I love going in there but your Homesense seems to have much better higher quality things. I'm a newer subscriber of yours and I love all your come shopping with me videos.  Keep them coming :)  BTW, has anyone told your friend Alix that she looks like Drew Barrymore?  I think she totally does.  You girls are both so lovely.  Ok, I'll stop fangirling now :'D
What lipstick are you wearing at 09:14? It looks beautiful :)
I am glad you got all the things you like. Beauty as they say is in the eye of the beholder as most of what you bought was not to my taste but then I like a plainer style of homewares and you probably wouldn't like the decor in my house! 😊

Hey amber! What camera do you use
Honestly, I started watching your videos from the past week and I absolutely love you. You seem so nice and so positive. I really love all of your videos, they're all entertaining and creative. Ly 💖
Amber, I'm so excited for what is to come for you! You're almost at 1 million followers and tons of more opportunities headed your way. 🌸 I keep coming back to watch your videos because you are so positive, fun, and funny. I wish you all the best, you deserve all these blessings.
Isn't it bad to ship from Ali express though? Idk i feel like people shouldn't buy from there, especially if they live in Europe or America or something and it's shipping all the way from china, also she mentioned that it only cost 40$ for that suit thing but I'm sure the people making it were only paid a few cents..
You look so cute on the thumbnail 😍😍😍I can't 😍😍
Amber I was watching the real girls eat cake video and I noticed you in the it!!!!😱😱😱

Could you do a video on how you think the make up industry is changing and what you like/dislike about the movement make up is making nowadays, would love to know your thoughts! X
If you're still thinking about cutting your hair off, this might be of interest: http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/ghd-little-princess-trust-cancer-chop-to-the-chin-charity-a7933501.html
Do you find these to be drying? Some matte lip products I've found to be very drying.
What's on your eyelids? So cool.
Loooove the lipsticks ! I think I would cut my hair of I were you.... after a shitty year it always feels like a fresh start... xxx
I love it longer!
PLEASE REVIEW THE FENTY BEAUTY LINE
Hi. Was wondering if you could give me some advice. I have an oily t-zone but I get very dry and I suffer from eczema especially around my eyes. Whenever I wear a fuller coverage foundation it never lasts on my skin, I find that I produce more oily even when it's a matte foundation. My skin is very dull but I try and take care of it the best I can. Shall I stay away from a higher coverage foundation? Is it why I'm getting more oily throughout the day? \nI would just like a long lasting foundation that doesn't make me skin look dull
Don't cut your hair
which is the lovely eye shadow you are wearing???
These colors are all pretty amazing. :)
Hi Pixi! Can I ask what eyelash curler you prefer the best? Your lashes are so up! Or maybe you could do a video about it :) GIRLS LIKE ME NEED HELP! <3
Sam I'm so jealous. Damn...  every color lipstick looks great on you. I wish I could pull off these lipsticks, but some of the colors just won't look good on me.
London Calling is amazing. It would go really well with my purple hair xD
I love your hair!
Keep it on! Your hair is great!
The pulling out enthusiastically and getting it everywhere part, I just can't hahahaha
I vote for a long bob 👏👏👏 it will look great on your wavy shiny hair 😍
I need London Calling in my life!!! ❤️
Who would think that you are 40? You look amazing!
I think u should defo cut ur hair, u would totally rock a blunt bob 👌🏼 Xx
Just ordered star woman on your recommendation
You look gorgouse .. chop that hair off
Love your makeup! You look so beautiful!
I was eyeing these up in store the other week - having seen them on you, Star Woman & Under my Thumb are definitely top of my wishlist now!
I think you both look glorious in long hair!
A cut to the shoulder would be nice, also like the lid color, what is that?
Looking forward to the tutorial for this look, Healthy Glow Make up...amazing!!
I think you'd look great with a shorter haircut !
That first nude one was so gorgeous 💛
All these shades make your eyes pop so much. Your eyes are stunning omg x
could you please do a review of new Dior Rouge liquid lipsticks!!!?
Lestoil.  Don't know if you have it over there, but it removes all oils....least all I've gotten on clothes😬
I have London calling and under my thumb
Keep it! And the color is great, too! 💆🏻
I always admire people that do liquid lip lip-swatches hahaha they're such a pain in the ass to do! thank u sam!
I was in Dublin for work and went to boots and bought the sponge and the concealed brush (years of craving them).Cant wait to use them!!!!
Oh God! Every color suits you !!!! Beautiful as always Xx
Its crazy how your look changes so much just by changing the lip colour.
Hey Sam, could you please recommend a good matte red lipstick with blue undertone from the drugstore? Looking gorgeous as always btw! And I loooove your hair, don´t get them chopped too much though :D xx
Do you avoid coffee and red wine or do you do something to make your teeth so beautifully white?
No leave your hair alone! Like the nude apricot best, then the last 2 reds...
Love these sorts of videos - thank you! And I'm desperately looking for long-lasting lipsticks that are minimal maintenance. I've been going high street for the moment but maybe I need to trade up. Thx again! Xx
A nice lob would be great for fall- very easy to care for and won't get caught in sweaters!
You have such glorious hair that I would perhaps add more layering, but cut it shorter, nah. \n\nI wish you would do more videos here again, since the live ones on Instagram go away.... 😕🙏🏻
Go for the chop babe!
Long bob!!  Get a lob, Sam!
Watching this as you lob off you pr hair!!
Yeahhhh chop it off! Shorter hair looks so chic in autumn/winter 🍂🍂
Every single one of those colours is amazing and they all look great on you!
i love how they're named after good fucking songs
Gorgeous!!! And please don't cut ur hair...i would like to see you in long hair. So please grow it.
Cut it change is good .... But honestly your stunning no matter what
I love this eye makeup! I can't wait for the video!
How beautiful you are!
Loved that currant shade on you! ❤️
Xse vedio
A bunch of great colours. 💜❤️ And yes, go for the cut! It sounds cool and if it isn't it'll grow back. (An obvious comment, haha.)
Oh my goodness every single one transforms your eyes and look completely!! 1st and 2nd are my fave 😍 your hairs lush! Especially in that VB pic on fb your glowing!xxx
Always feels great to get some hair chopped off!!
Can you do a tutorial on the eye look? Every time I try to do a glossy eye look it melts away my eyeliner and makes it look messy. How do you keep everything in place when doing it? Thank you!!
Did I miss a video on how to do an ombre lip? Would love to see you gorgeous girls teaching this in a matte lip👄\nAnd I just watched your Favorite Lipsticks video from Nov '15 and, just my personal opinion, but your current longer hair is just very youthful and stunning!! Much love from Alabama❣️
Yes, haircut. I vote just above shoulder-length (like you suggested), possibly a shag. You've got enough hair that that would look so killer. :-D
Hey Sam. I really like the look of those but will be hard to choose which colour to get. On the hair front - I recently cut my hair into a choppy bob and I love the shorter hair. Go for it - it hair - if you don't like it, it will grow back xx
Yeaahhhhh girl, cut that hair. I vote yes.
Amk bn sizi TLC den izliyom #sonşanskliniği
Коралловый очень вас очень освежает и молодит! Супер!
Where your earrings from?

Yesss! Cut the hair!! Something edgy, and fresh. Doooo itttt!!!
Cheek bone goals

Love your hair!
Yeeeessss chop it off!! It'll look sooo good against your sharp jawline 😍😍😍
Did anyone ells think the thumbnail was Katelynn jenner
chop it! hair always grows.
All the colors look stunning on you!
Hi Sam!! Absolutely loving you!           \nI'm Sitting at home watching the X Factor and admiring Sharon osbourne's makeup! Could you do a tutorial pls. I love her eyes!
Having to sift through comments to delete weird sex spam..seriously what is with people. Love this video though, so happy that you don't follow suit to the rest of the beauty community with the ridged 'instagram' style makeup x
Hi Sam, loved all the colours on you, beautiful 😍 Did you find the nars formula drying at all? I've tried the mac liquid lipsticks but they just make my lips crack.
You would look great with any hairstyle, last colour is my favourite
You really suit red 😘 💋
love your hair keep it long you look sexy ur sooo cute
You have such a dazzling bone structure. Very beautiful face.
All the colors looked gorgeous on you!
i would love to see a tutorial on your eye look - you look absolutely stunning! :) <3
I say cut your hair! Honestly you could do anything to your hair and you'll look stunning!!
looking gorge as always Sam! i love the colours done it again and starwomam! and about your hair i think you should keep the length but make it less heavy giving it lots of texture. the colour for autumn looks fab, maybe more of those chunky cooper highlights/balayage through the ends keeping the base colour!
I think you'll cut it no matter what we tell you, the idea is already in your head  😂 I just went through the same thing and chopped mine off 🙈
Don't you dare cut your hair! You currently have the cut of my dreams but my hair is not thick enough for that. It looks sensational!
chop your hair! it will always grow back :) love this video, there wasnt a colour that didnt suit you!
Love, love and love some more! What gorgeous colors!!! And Sam, you would look beautiful bald! But i do envy your beautiful hair!!! Ty for sharing these!
Please disable the comments on this video.  You are being spammed by terrible people.  =(
I make interesting cartoons and I need your help! Go to the channel, rate my work!
When my cat was still a few months old, we had to give her milk (the milk they sell in pet shops) because she couldn't drink water... she tried to, but since the water is transparent, she couldn't see where it was and she would always end up shoving her head inside the water and run away ahahah... damn, she was so cute...
Fact No.1 THEY ARE OUR INTERNET OVERLORDS
...was that a Quake I sound...
да как можно поставить дизлайк видео о котятках?
NEVER adopt a kitty only 6 or 7 weeks old!!!! They should be at least 10 or even better 12 weeks old before separated from their mother. They still get nursed  and need the socializing with their mother and siblings until then.\n\nI think it's horrible that this 6 two 8 weeks advise is given here.
my little sister nude https://yadi.sk/d/MNh4E8vU3MkqG7 password sexy
Где Саймон?\nНу, а советы хорошие.
I've rescued three! Two when they were kittens (12+ years ago) and a rehomed cat, 1-2 years old (the previous owner couldn't remember exactly how old he was...)\n\nI remember getting my kittens. My other cat had died a year earlier and I missed having a cat so much. My mom would drive us to the Humane Society every week to check for kittens. The third week they were there! A little older than I was expecting (12-14 weeks), but the Humane Society probably waited to put them up for adoption until they were a little older.\nI'm definitely a cat person. They're awesome.
Subscribe To My channel for the Coolest Vids!!! ill return
Wait. You mean i have to feed it regularly.
I'm surprised this channel has not died yet.\nGoodjob
Poor Kittie😿

Soo cute!!!!
TRENDING!!! :D
Somebody is jalou!
Uh oh. Someone is jealous!
I think it might be interesting to see a video with Nicky talking about why cats sit in boxes drawn on the floor sometime. Hopefully she's got some idea ...
I wanna! D=

My dad actually got a kitten! OMG!
Best cartoon ever. Keep em coming the best you can. So adorable. I've watched every single episode so far. 10/10
Could you please please please do a video on preparing your cat for a newborn baby coming home? I'm so worried how my cat's going to react when I have my baby in a couple weeks 😯
I have A Question. One of my cats (female) is in heat. And I have another Female cat who has started following her Around. What does that mean?
MMMMM FUCK💦  HORNY AF?  OOOOO SHIT FUCK MEE TILL I CUM💦💦💦🔥🔥🔥😰😰 AND JERK OFF ..💦💦💦💦💦💦💦🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍😘😘😘😍😍😍😍FUCK ME😍😍😍VIEW ME😍HURRY😍😍😍FUCK HARDER😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍FASTERmo
❤️=^..^= Mew!
and please don't forget the grown cats! They need love too!
My kitten has a obsession with trying to climb out of the 3rd floor window! He pushes it open! It's so scary!
You should also tell people about the juvenile stage
Lactose free milk is an ok treat, but remember it should be a treat only! it should not be given every day for meals, and DO NOT REPLACE KITTEN FOOD WITH IT!!! If you find an stray and hungry cat(kitten) meats like bologna and tuna can be a good temporary meal, remember that KITTENS need specialized food because they are still growing
Ok so you guys live somewhere because your all British
I may can help you some people those who have cats: \n\nhttps://tinyurl.com/yc65cmyl - Ultimate Cat Secrets \n\nhttps://tinyurl.com/y7c953cv - Brand New!

My kitten was weaned young. If you have a kitten like this buy it a bottle (even though it doesn't need it) and every few day give them about a 1\2 tablespoon of milk. This will make the kitten feel more at ease with not being around mum. I did this with my baby boy until he bit through his bottle. It really helped him relax and he quit crying.
CATS RULE!!! dogs drool... \nWhy should everyone on YouTube suffer for a few dumb things PewDiePie did? \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
In Pawtrait, there was a cute pic of the baby Simon's cat on the wall. :)
I absolutely love kittens.  After the kitten is... 'dispatched' and skinned, remove the head and tail, trim out the larger meat fillets, dip into a mixture of beaten egg and basil, coat lightly with breadcrumbs, and bake at 375 for 30 minutes.  Serve with mini red potatoes, asparagus with a drizzle of lemon-butter.  The me - yow factor is off the charts!
I hear everytime that appartment cats have to have another cat as a playmate. Because as i was young we had a cat and he didnt had a playmate. And my cat doesnt have one either. Just me and my family. But a friend says everytime that my cat needs another cat as a playmate. Is that true?
Adult cats are pretty awesome choices too if you are looking for a cat. No potty training, they still bond to you, they are chill (most of the time). Even when I adopted the really mean older cats, they turned into cuddle bugs after a few days because they are out of a stressful environment. :)
and this is why you set up the camera first. Simon never learns.
Oh you quickly learn not to give your cat milk even if he loves it so much and meows so desperately when you have milk in your hands - cleaning the litter box of cat diarrhea is not my favorite.
Nicky gives so much of wrong information away. No good for anyone who really relies on that information. Many people have already written about the information:\n- no milk (kittens and cats are lactose intolerant)\n- leave the kitten alone when it just arrived and allow it to settle\n- adopt at least two kittens, not only one\nWhat I haven't read yet is about the age. Adopting a kitten when it's only 6 or 8 weeks old, is way too early. Kittens must not be separated from their mother until they're at least 12 weeks old! And please make sure that neither you or a family member has an allergy against cat hair before adopting.
Flagged and reported this video as hate speech.
Where are all the black and white cute vids and higinks
What about don't tickle a cats belly unless it's learning as it's not really something a cat wants nor accepts most of the time. It shows its belly as trust not as a sign for a belly rub.
You can give a kitten goats milk it doesn't have as much sugar in it to upset the kittens tummy. All your vet. I use it when many cat isn't feeling good. I warm it before feeding it to him. He's 19 yrs old.
Im going to do cat animion soon but I'm lacking. A cat
If I had known this was a Nicky video, I would have clicked immediately because I like the way she says port of call...
Nicky 3
2 me there are 2 things about kittens to know. I love kittens.(adopted a blind on that was weeks from birth. Sadly died falling from a high spot. Sad sad moment.) 2 my landlord is antipets and he is evil....(it makes sense though pets can cause some issues.)
There are 2 cats in my neighborhood that I feed.  The boy enjoys leftover milk from my morning cereal.  The girl will generally leave it alone- unless the boy is around to drink it.
I like the way she says Kitten!
Milk no no cuddles, love,  playtime, and sleep ( with or without human) excuse me, my kitten is halfway up my curtains!!!
what pisses me off is people dumping kittens on the side of roads when shelters cant keep kittens there always adapted out. its fully grown cats and dogs that they have issues finding new homes for.
Good points. I like the presentations with Nicky. Lots of good information for cat parents or people thinking about becoming cat parents.
Good job recommending the shelters and rescue facilities.  They have so many cats both kitten and senior that need good homes!
I love Simon's Cat videos.  They remind me so much about my own four mystic moggies who, sadly, are no longer with us.
so are nicky and simon hooked up??    she's a diamond.........and she has an engagement ring on
Can you do What Things You Need To Know About Adult (or Senior) Cats?
You should probably say another animal's milk or cow's milk. It's strange and unhealthy for any being to drink the milk of a different species 💙 Not to mention the cruelty involved in obtaining milk from the mother.
can you do a video on feral cats?
I prefer 1+-year-old cats over kittens.  Sure, kittens are cute, but older cats are more level and easier to train (*less* distracted).  Also, you should point-out the importance of teaching basic commands (sit,  stay, down).  Many people let their cats get away with little/no training without seeing the complete joy of having a properly-trained cat.\nNeither of my cats had issues with milk.  They never got a lot, but a tiny bowl one or twice a month was a special treat.  Fluffy (20) even liked a little melted ice cream…when we had room in the freezer.  Tony (14) just liked a little milk, especially when he'd try to steal it from my Coonhound, Lilly.  You could tell that it was a power issue because he NEVER did that with Sue (15), our late Heeler mix.
That was very informative and very entertaining to watch good job Simon
I do find some of the narratives helpful and I learn something new everytime I see an episode!!
She's a cutie.
Loving this! I am the proud foster mommy of 5 tiny tumbling tigers.  It's so much fun to watch them learn and relate to my 4 adult cats, who have stepped in to help care for them by disciplining them, washing them and of course, playing. Trying to get staged photos of them is exactly like this, the minute one poses beautifully, one of their siblings or an adult cat steps right in.
Dear Simon's Cat friends. This is a public forum that kids looks at. Dropping F bombs arguing about cat food is ridiculous and juvenile. Remember, yours is just an opinion, not fact. Everyone is entitled to theirs. My cats are 14 ,15 and 17, are super healthy and have eaten Purina dry for half of their lives. Now they have Iams dry food. NO wet food. They have great teeth and seem really happy and playful. That works for me and them, but maybe not you. Be happy your pet is healthy and stick with what works for you. Try being nice to other people, and your pets will think you're pretty cool for acting like them.
My cat would follow my mum around every morning meowing what sounded like milk until she gave it to him. It wasn't until he got older that he had trouble with milk. He couldn't tell rice milk apart from cow milk. Either that or he didn't care. Later both he and his sister lost the ability to digest any kind of cat treat. We still wanted to reward good behavior. They had no problems with their kibble. So I simply put some kibble in a separate container. When they earned a treat, I got some from the special container. They were just as excited as if it were something other than what they always eat. So presentation was all that mattered. Cheaper too.
The end was Savage as fuk
i love the cats 😻😻😻😻
My cat is highly lactose intolerant lol when she was a baby she used to get sick from her mums milk but she's healthy strong and beautiful
I just said goodbye to my senior kitty. The last thing I really wanted to do was bring kittens into the house but I was alerted to 16 kittens desperately needing homes. I took 2 home. I  am nursing an injured leg and need to rest it a lot.  The kittens insist that my face is the best place to lay down and sleep. I realize how bored I woul be without these 2 kittens!  Figaro and Octavia.
Is it true that, for a kitten, playtime is just as important as a good diet? I don't remember where I got this information from. The kittens that I've ever had, when they wanted to play I did my best to provide play time. When they wanted to rest, they were allowed to rest. They grew up to be fine cats.
I have a kitten named Zeus and each time you cuddle with him he'll start sucking on a blanket or Whatever he can reach, i know this is from him being away from his mother too early, but i was was wondering if there is anything i should do?
We recently got a beautiful black kitten from a rescue shelter. If anybody wants to see her then there's a video on my channel!
You can buy Cat milk :)))
Cats are lactose intolerant, like me. My cat loves yogurt and ice cream, like me. We fart together
Do yourself a favor and get an older cat from the shelter. Kittens are super cute but older cats are less likely to get adopted so they need you more. Plus they are much calmer and you will know exactly what kind of character they have. If you have ever experienced the havoc a kitten can wreak on your home, you know what I'm talking about.
It's a common misconception, that cats need milk. Is it? I always thought everyone knows, that cats WANT and LIKE milk but as all mammals they don't really need it. I was mislead by my brain... O.o
my cat sometimes goes on the couch, stick her paws into the cushions, then whips her head around meowing before doing flips and turns. If anybody is wondering she's a tortie calico mix.

My cat had a wonderful 17year life he drank milk every day in our home and ate mice, birds and little rabbits, sometimes food from us but he preferred the natural food, most special cat food was disliked he was happy with our family and the garden nature outside of our house.
My cat is a month old brother of God guided by a large cat Gap of the house and bite in the neck left and bleeding but with the passage of time stop the bleeding and we keep the wound and then the left eye is almost not see it and the tumor\nI think it's broken. Does anyone know how to fix this problem? Please 💔
Why do americans give their pets food names like butter and candy. I dont call my cat hamburger or ice cream. Thats the same to calling you're dog chair you dont do that XD
Yeah.. I'm not making the mistake of taking a cat from a shelter again. Or they got mental issues or they got health issues. Or most likely both.
Don't feed ur cat wet food unless u don't want them to catch mice
The makeup artist is so considerate of people with not much money and people who aren't good at makeup, very refreshing given the late trend of online makeup artists not being very helpful and just doing their makeup on camera and using incredibly expensive makeup. Her tricks are really clever and easy too!
I can see the headlines now... Toilet seat covers disappear all over the US from public restrooms, and no one knows why...
Love Amy! and I Love the colour of your lips Lisa.
Dear Lisa, when your reach 2 million subscribers can you do the ultimate giveaway and do the makeup of one of your subscribers. That would be incredible. I look through all the comments and everyone (girls and boys too) would be over the moon for that opportunity!  - xoxo, Tiff
I love when you bring guest artists on your channel. So cool seeing their different techniques and perspectives. I love that Amy used Rimmel products. That lip enhancer was beautiful!
Wow. I love Amy. This gave me the chills.
I adore the way Ms. Valli has zero hesitation with any of the products she is using, you don't see that from makeup artists very much any more. Thank you again Lisa, for a wonderful video!
Am I the only one who thinks Lisa's videos are so relaxing and therapeutic to watch? I love them so much
It's so lovely to watch and listen to true professionals at work. What an honour it would be to have a make uplesson from any of the guest artists Lisa chooses, or even better, from Lisa herself 💙
Glue or gel in eyebrows can be dangerous on a smoker. I burned mine once in a wedding party (perfect make up) the flame of the lighter was big  and yyyyooouufff \nThe tip of each hair disapeared 📛🚭
Hmmm I thought the model looked gorgeous before the makeup
I have used that toilet seat cover trick for about two decades, lol. She is right. It's like the exact same texture as oil blotting papers.
I love how Amy was such a British girl, she used rimmel I'm a little shock. Also I love how Valli use all the tools that are in style now and she's very knowledgeable about all the new trends. She's awesome. Great video
You are so beautiful❤️❤️
LOVED LOVED THIS... WHERE ARE VALLI'S RINGS FOR GODS SAKE¿?????????
Valli is hilarious!!! Please have her come back for more looks! Amy - what a look!
These eyebrows are amazing, they're not like those wiggly worms everyone seems to be doing THE SHADEEE LMAO. I hate them too though
I feel bad noticing Lisa's winged liner in a video about Amy Winehouse's makeup, but I can't help it. I reckon it's done with black or grey eyeshadow. If there isn't a tutoria already, I'd love to see one
Amy did wear a lot of orange blush that had a highlighter like shine and would sometimes wear blue under her bottom lashes (blue liquid liner) but that was more 2003-2007 Amy Winehouse. She often wore a hot pinky red liner too
It's gorgeous. This look is so exciting and in the same time I feel sad. I miss this incredible talented  female. Amy was unique.
I love this video, thanks Lisa for bringing such talented artist into your channel, you both are gifted
Such a good video, thanks so much for sharing this. :)
So refreshing to see a genuine established makeup artist on YouTube for a change, thanks Lisa and thanks Valli for all the great tips! Xx
The Amy makeup tutorial was amazing , and also ur makeup in the video is amazing can u do it for us in a video , you are so classy and talented I love you ❤️
The model looks like lady Gaga
Can you do a bridgette neilson look?
I honestly thought Amy did her own makeup
Amazing. This video feels like a gift. Thank you Lisa and Valli O'Riley!
Loved watching this so much, watched it twice in a row! She has such a soothing voice and she was so gentle. I hate to see rough make up artists with the models flinching!
Amy Whinehouse was one of my favorite artists.  This was an amazing tutorial!  Love when you have guests.  So much you can learn.  😚
sooooo beautiful i dont even know what to say
Hearing her name still breaks my ♥. There will never be another artist quite like her. She is inimitable.  What a terrible loss for us all that she died so young.
What an amazing video. The model has such a beautiful face and the end result looked so much like Amy Winehouse. Valli made it look so easy when she was adding the subtle touches of highlight around the eyes - such talent!  Thanks, Lisa and Valli for this video.
I looove how the model resembles Amy so well
I always loved her mix of classic and glam. She always made me think of a young Sophia Loren. Thank you Lisa for bringing these iconic artists and celebrity looks to us. I have learned so much from your videos!
I love intelligent makeup talk. ^_^
I can't stop watching this Video!!!
Did anyone else just beam at the beauty of Lisa as soon as her gorgeous face popped up at the beginning? I can do my own makeup well but if I were famous I'd let her do my makeup in a heartbeat.
Love ❤️ this makeup artist 's rings and the sound of her bracelets jingling.  ✨
Lisa make up tutorial for your look at the beginning of the vid please ❤️💘💗💋
you guys don't have seat covers ????
Her voice is Sooooooo soothing! Such a lovely lady :) love her jewellery btw🤘
Fabulous! Kate the model was working it giving us the Amy Winehouse vibe!💋
This was amazing. Please make her recreate the Anne Hathaway look😍
another great substitute for brow gel is hairspray. just save an old mascara wand, wash it and spray it with hairspray and go through the brows :-)
Oh, Lisa! Thank you so much for that!! Just one let stated how thankful I'm for your time. What a beautiful homage! So nice of O'Reilly for of accepting your invitation. Thank you, thank you!
Love your lip colour here Lisa and the lip colour used for the model :)
i love russian red ❤️ (its a lipcolor everybody looks great with 😁)
Love it!!  So great to see such a cool Amy/retro look accomplished WITHOUT huge swathes of contour/bronzer & near white blocks of undereye concealer.
Hi Lisa!  This was an absolutely fabulous video. Thanks!
It's a tip i learned from the drag queens in the 80's... I could listen to her life experience all day long! <3 Two classy, talented and stunning ladys! We are so blessed to be able to listen to these ladys. Thank you youtube. And thank you Lisa! Love from Germany!
This was such a respectful video, and beautifully done. Starting off by stating I didn't design this makeup look, Amy did was just so honest and a real tribute to Amy's passion for retro looks and music. Wonderfully done!
FINALLY A NEW VIDEO!
This was so good!!!
I enjoyed this video so much, thank you Lisa. Please do more of these if you can
Thank you Valli O'Reilly!  Wow this is one awesome video, such iconic makeup artists!  Love you Lisa and thank you for creating the best channel.  Hugs from the USA!
Brow tip: take a creamy, unscented lip balm (like Aquaphor - which rarely helps chapped lips anyways), squeeze a bit on the back of your hand, then dip a clean spoolie in it and brush your brows with it! They will stay in place without looking like they're all stiff and rigid.\n\nPS. Lisa, the fact that you bring other make up artists on your channel says a lot about you. Mainly that you care about spreading knowledge and that you are confident enough in your skills to not make the channel all about you. Much love x
What an incredibly light hand!
Lisa, thank you so much for inviting Valli here, and for your lovely model. Your own makeup is beautiful here too - so fresh and glowy.
Love it. Thank you Lisa. Your channel is in a class of its own.
Lisa, Please do a Nicole Kidman look you did on her at Cannes this year ! Thank you !! xx
İ just love listening to you. Your voice is so relaxing. İ can listen all day :)
Amy's look was one of my all time favourites, I had no idea she designed it herself!
Thanks Lisa for always showing us something different and sharing not just your knowledge but also your fellow make up artists friends! It was great to see in action such a big name in the american cinematographic make up industry.
Lisa you are a beautiful human being. I love how you invite guest artists for them to share their talents and tricks as well on your youtube channel.
I miss Amy so much, it's the first time I cry over a makeup tutorial OMG
So stunning and I learned so much. 💗✨💗✨💗✨
I'm jealous of the models eyelashes!!! She's gorgeous
Wow what a treat thank you Lisa !!!!!!
I hope the model dos wear it home on the underground. She looked amazing. \nAnd I loved the fact Amy was advocating British makeup brand rimmel. She could have used more expensive brands bit she stuck to her roots. \nMakes me love you even more Amy . RIP xx
Beautiful work, beautiful model, favourite channel ever. Thanks Lisa, Valli, and Kate!
Omg the model looks so much like Jen Atkin!
Its funny how actually working and famous makeup artists like to use very simple inexpensive products a lot while all these youtube muas use all this expensive stuff and balk at using glue stick as eyebrow gel. I absolutely love her tips and her nice wearable look! I love how you're able to bring on the MUA's who actually did this looks on the celebrity. \n\nCould you do an authethic 1920's silent movie makeup Lisa? I know it won't be too pretty when its accurate and not tailored to 21st century tatses but would be great education.
You mention Anna May Wong in your book as a makeup muse, it would be lovely to see a makeup look based on her.
I miss Amy Winehouse so much that I can't even listen to her music without crying 😢
AMY! ❤️❤️❤️ I absolutely love this!
The video was ok but the instructions for the eyeliner were missing and that is the most iconic part
She was delightful! Thx Lisa & Valli❤️
This is iconic. I'm thinking of stealing this look. Wonder if it will work with my pixie hair cut
Realy enjoy every video u make 😍 super inspiring 🙌🏼
Wow!
wow!
Wow this is amazing!!!!
I miss Amy :(
Obsessed with these videos!! 🌺🌸🌹🌺🌸🌹🌺🌸🌹🌺🌸🌹🌺🌸🌹🌺🌸🌹
I love her.
Beautiful
Thoroughly enjoyable, thank you Lisa!
😍😍😍😍
Love the matte lip tip
Beautiful. Minimalist. Clean.
amazing
Oh, Amy... 💔
Amazing!
please do a lana del rey inspired look!!!
Does anything happen to your eyelids and under eye areas after years of putting foundation on them instead of concealer?
Lisa could you please do awesome looks for silver/grey haired ladies...how to do natural looks and more glam looks. We have the tendency to look dull or washed out if makeup is not properly done, especially for fair skin. Pleeeease
Lisa I miss your tutorials done on yourself.  Please do a nice fall look xx😻😻
I have a Rimmel lip liner in Red Diva....is this the same as the one she mentioned called Diva?
I absolutely love her rings!! What amazing jewelry... Any idea on possible brand? lovely tutorial as usual!
oscars son Devon and his latest fight video\nhttps://youtu.be/PNmWB6Zo4KU
De La Hoya is taking a lot of shots at Mayweather. He's just jealous and bitter.
To get to fight you have to be signed with a promoter Stone age
I was riding with Floyd since he Pretty Boy way before Money May days. But I love and respect all boxers my favorite sport.
18:28 YES FLOYD MAYWEATHER WAS SIGNED TO GOLDEN BOY OWNED BY OSCAR DE LA HOYA
Oscar De La Hoya SNITCHING on Floyd!!!!! Floyd and Conor completely FUCKED UP the GGG/CANELO fight!!!! No one cares about this fight now!!!! Mayweather threatened to do it last year on Cinco de Mayo weekend!!!! Now Oscar comes to hiphop radio to promote this fight!!! Mayweather vs Canelo totally eclipsed this fight
Oscar De La Hoya you are a true Champion dear Sir and an honor to the sport of Boxing, you spoke with truth and honesty in this interview, Respect!! p.s I know is in the past man, but sincerely I always thought you won that Tito Ortiz fight way back then.
21:40  He said Louis Armstrong was in his top 5 boxers.  Joe Louis is who he probably meant to say
TBH if golden boy didnt exist boxing would be boring and dead!
This dude is a clown 🤡
Its not floyd fault there wasnt anybody out there that woulda been favored over him lol wtf oscar talking about?
How are you a cross-dresser and coke head and say what you don't like about somebody's personal life?? WTF
I'm sooooo glad CTheGod asked him about the lingerie pics 👙😂
This was a good interview
😂😂 oscar still upset floyd whooped that ass, is still undefeated and a few hundred milli up 😂😂
She stay asking the worst questions ever wtf
I can definitely respect how he answered the questions about drugs and alcohol. He didn't even flinch and that's a hard thing to admit that it was the hardest fight in life and you're getting knocked down every day. They did ask about mayweather a lot even when he was talking about other stuff. But overall, this was a great mature interview
Del La Hoya is a legend without question.
Floyd beat your wanna be well spoken college professor ass. Take it like a man
hard time in my life.. wtf kind of response was that.. was he crossdressing and getting paid to give blow jobs on the street?  rofl wtf.. I would have just said that i was with this crazy broad and was drunk and made a fool out of myself.. something..  jesus.
Someone needed to call out Dela hoya on A LOT of statements here. Him saying old school fighters didn't carry each other is completely wrong, they did it all the time so older fighters could get more fights in the future EX: Sugar ray robinson vs. Henry Armstrong.
this guy is confused, he talks about if you can change your life around ( mike tyson) ... but cant respect Mayweather for what he did back in his day...
Oscar is now saying it's a farce and a circus for Mcgregor to have taken a boxing match???\n\nWhen this fight was first coming together Oscar said he wanted to sign Mcgregor and it made all the sense in the world for Connor to fight Canelo.\n\nThe video is here:\nhttps://www.sportsjoe.ie/mma/oscar-de-la-hoya-wants-conor-mcgregor-to-come-and-fight-for-him-105407\n\nIs there one damn interview where someone calls Oscar out on this??? WTF.
Envy : so tell the people what fishnets are...
If your fighting all the time and you have to be aggressive all the time, i'm not surprised dude got all coked out and ended up doing some freaky shit lol.
This dude proposed canelo v mcgregor. Hypocrite just mad he isn't a part of the $$
I know this fool ain't talking bout what's disrespectful to boxing when he appears in many photos wearing women's lingerie looking like a Tranny!
Oscar it's legend
This guys such a lier he wanted to match mcgregor with canelo LOL
Fishnets? He had prostitutes put dildos in his ass. AND THERE ARE PICS OF IT!!!!!!!! Don't recommend googling tho 😩🙈
Everyone who follows boxing has always said this about boxing-that it sucks because the best are not fighting the best at their best and it's all corrupted.  I think the sales/viewers  prove this statement...
Wait, Tyson Rape a women , he loves him. mayweather is in an abusive relationship he hates him
He dont even know whos on the undercard
Wow..... hypocrisy!!! how can one harper on about another mans domestic violence, are you clark kent??? are really that a against it or is it cause Floyd did to you what he did to that girl??\n im so lost... since when do crossdressing crackheads have an opinion?? but lowkey..  when you think about it, a crossdressing man would have an issue with domestic violence..
Charlemagnes one and only purpose in life is playing a black victim
I watched Cotto vs Kamegai that same night and I still saw the whole Mayweather vs McGregor and trust me the Cotto fight was WAAAAAAAY BETTER!!
Oscar is 4 yrs older than Floyd when they fought Oscar was 34, Floyd was 30. He need to stop acting like he was damn near 40 and Floyd was 26 or something.
He won't hit women just dress up like one WTF ctfu
CTFUUU  I died when I spoke on the fishnetgate!!! Yo I remember he was in fishnet, heels and boxing gloves ... SAVAGE ..Thank God, Oscar is in a better place. He looks great!
Who really cares about the opinions of an alcoholic, cross dressing rapist
I don't get this comment section, they make fun of Oscar for cross dressing but yet they support the fashion of an artist that cross dress like young thug and Kanye fashion line🤔
Also, don't act like your dad doesn't do coke. Its a pretty common drug. It's not like he was smoking meth behind a dumpster, let's be real about that. People just hang on floyds nuts so they use his same insults.
Hoya is kinda speaking the truth! we see better fights on WorldStar!!!!
His lefty pinky finger is so fucked up...
Mayweather surpassed your legacy and is in many people's top 5 List. The envy is apparent.
De La Hoya knows jack sh*t about MMA. Conor McGregor ain't sh*t an is not the very best. He ain't even top 15 in any weight and that's being honest! He's not fighting the very best. The very best he fought was Jose Aldo who hadn't lost in 7 years or more, never gave him a rematch.  He fought a scrub to win the LW title and won't fight the best now at Lightweight. He's protected.
hmm.. so mr De La Hoya respects Mike who also had woman abuse chargers, but he doesnt respect Floyd for the same thing ...
Such a liar. Canelo fought at 155 (above Super WW) for 2 years then comes into fights at 175! But he's not a middleweight?!?!
Mayweather beat him and his whole stable he shouldn't really speak on Floyd. We all know If he was involved in the that fight he would've been telling everyone he gave Connor the blueprint
They set him up....to clown him for someone (guesses?)......street shit....do you see the gay flag in the background right behind his head....they prepared for that fishnet question about something 10 years ago and that question is relevant how now?
Charlemagne tryna see how Oscar looks in that lingerie 😭😂
Oscar was lieing on that last question he filed bankruptcy before so he must have done something dum with money
Charlemagne first question is the shit.non English speaking guys
Oscar is mad he missed out on all that money!
Disrespectful to boxing? Thats funny because De La Hoya wanted to have canello fight mcgregor before all of this
What was going on with you in the ligerie? Hahaha.
Oscar De La Hoya admits he LIED about drag pictures; his punk ass paid $20 million to model to keep it hidden!
he gives off a sleazy car salesman vibe.
Please, if Oscar put this together he would not be talking all this sht
You can tell he did something really gay and is really embarrassed
I'm on vacation in Portugal day of the fight, anyone know if they show the boxing matches down there? I know in other countries they have PPV fights for free.
Oscar De La Hoya is speaking the truth GGG vs Canelo is a real fight nobody is gonna be punching themselves out a great fight the whole way.
DeLaHoya is funny to me.  He smiles, but he packs a lot of anger, which enhanced his boxing career.
Pretty boy is now worth 5X's more than the Golden boy. LOL KARMA....
I appreciate Oscar's honesty here....and for those of you wondering, he meant Hammerin' Hank Armstrong, not Louis Armstrong (Jazz great).
Lol this is a maywether interview
Ahahahaha Charlemagne had to ask that lingerie question lmao
Pacquaio in his prime? HE IS 2 YEARS YOUNGER THAN FLOYD when was he supposed to fight him? Manny will always be younger than Floyd so waiting to fight benefited Pacquiao not Mayweather. \n\nAlso, Oacar was only 34 when he fought Floyd so ge was not over the hill. Floyd fought an in prime Cotto, Maidana and Canelo ALL after he was 34... \n\nAND! He was was the first promoter trying to get Mcgregor in the ring to v Canelo yet he mocks a Floyd Conor fight? This guy just talks out of his ass.
Hahaha his answer tho , it was just a bad time in my life hahaha wat does that mean lol
I never did like the golden flake but I always thought the fishnet pics were doctored up. What a fucken FAG
That starbucks cup is his fix
Floyd proved that his old ass needs to stayed retired lol
Shoutout to the greatest GHANAIAN boxer for knocking some creative sense into oscar de la hoya. lol
Was it 4 million buys? Or 6.5?
Shout out charlagmane for asking the questions that everybody want to know but too politically correct to ask...
Oscar was a great boxer who never ran from anyone. With that being said, he seems like a hater in this interview.
he has to ask that... if he doesn't: his core fanbase would slander him.... if he does: he's digging up past issues and a firestarter. Catch 22.
He sure has been running his mouth, riding Mayweather and McGregor's coat tail lately.
chalemagne keep bringingin up mayweather chill de la hoya gave him his props lol
Oscar a hating ass migo
Do you hate Floyd Mayweather Jr. ? Lmaoooo
Oscar sounding like a HATER
hahahahah oscar classy wow!!Charlemagne didn't even laugh he look scared

😍😍😍
Can you try ASOS
He actually has bars
Welp.... its better than jacob satorious' songs so imma give it a thumbs up
Fire 🔥🔥🔥
This song man🔥🔥🔥🔥
Xxl 2018
if lonzo had add liangelo he would ask if he could add lidickey (who isnt a ball brother) instead
This song is lit
Why this not on spotify
Yo why the chorus sounds like Michael Trapson?🤔
He can't talk about liangelo because he is in college .
Yo this lit
He stole paul wall flow
Zo got Bars! BIGG BALLER!
Am I the only one who thinks this song is really fucking ass
Nas memorized his own verses before he recorded em...
lmao this is fucking terrible. Damian Lillard is the only baller who should be rapping.
triple b's in this thang....
Not bad wouldn't listen to it on repeat though.
Heavy
i think i just puked in my mouth.
In the start it sounds like despacito like if u agree
Lonzo lonzo lonzo just jumped over jumpman
I said this negga is not getting a shoe endorsements that's he sucks
Not bad at all... Can we get 3 mins+ on the next track!?
lonzo spittin...not bad...better than shaq...
Lonzo 2nd part just went nuts
d
This family are born to be superstars
Straight 🔥tho.
What's this channels email
Still can't believe Kenneth is a singer bro, when we were kids he played ball and Drums. Dat boi boutta blow up
If you're gonna say Nas is irrelevant and then you try and drop a song right after , that shit better be fire. This shit is gay as fuck
Should've got the 4th brother on the track! Lil Dicky probably would've went in
Stay in your lane
People doubt liangelo he is gon be better then people think honestly
Honestly didn't think he had bars.... zo goes hard lol I only seen a couple freestyles but he can do both. Fuck hating on this dude. At least he's about his fam
Mix race folk are superhuman I swear.. good at everything & super handsome lol needa get summa their genes so I can pawn them on eBay
Imagine lakers make a trade for a late first or early second and they draft gelo, then they sign melo as a FA. I see it. Magic is into that kinda stuff, too, keeping things entertaining like Dr. Buss.
At the end gelo gonna be better than both of them, y'all gonna see
Wow Lonzo is gonna be a superstar this family too lit
Name of the instrumental?
How you hating, but then you banging this!
LiAngelo got no shoe Lamelo got a shoe Liangelo got a Ferrari ehh it's ok but Lamelo got a LAMBO!! cmon I feel bad for Gelo he gets no respect or attention at all smh
Tf kind of shit is this😂😂
They just played somebody to make this
This not half bad 😂
Damian Lillard should hop on the remix. 💯
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HTNWYpemxI      -  Jason Kidd - What The Kidd Did (1994 Rap Track Feat Money B)
The nigga on the hook is trash but Lonzo is kinda nice actually
Not really a Ball fan, but this track is pretty lit, but they can lose Kenneth
Lonzo should put some of his songs on Spotify, there fucking lit
fuck lonzo hes not real rap smfh
Slapper
lit!
Better be lyrical and platinum if you talk shit about Nas
🔥🔥🔥
Its the BALL ERA my dudes
Dave East would've murdered this beat💯Him and Chris Brown wit Chris on the hook
the beat is sexy ass lonzo killed it
Triple b's in this thang
Big bootie
He should become a rapper drop albums and drop 3's at the same time
I dont like them but its kind of good
I want this stuff on spotify it's lit
bars n flow nice.. cadence n delivery need work
Liangelo gonna make a disstrack w/ ksi bout lavar , zo and melo
Where LiDicky Ball?
here before 500k
Wtf is this 🤣
wheres my boy liangelo
who is this knockoff Weeknd lmaooo... lonzo was fye tho
That nigga lonzo rippin shit

Straight bars.Straight respec.
I need 200 subs I got.118 right now
W
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
fire
Who came from troydan reacts
Nas is laughing his ass off, this isnt even crap, its like superdupper crap
SHITS SO FUCKING GAY HAHAHAHAHAHA WHOEVER SAID THIS SLAPS KILL YA SELVES
A 3 min video with an unskippable ad. This video deserves its 55 dislikes:/
SO CUTE ALL OF THEM.
This cast is so frickin good. I'd watch a sitcom with all 7 of them right now. Doesn't have to be on the same source material, just the same 7 actors with somewhat similar characters all in one show. Someone please make that exist
Wyatt is so sweet, his little smiles and laughs arggghhhhh
The new version really sucked
This is the best cast ever they are all so funny and sweet to each other 🎈❤️
I think going too Home Depot would be cool because you can pick up a wrench and be like *holds up wrench with death stare*
Excuse me when did Finn's voice get so deep?! No! He should still be a baby!!
How much does Beverly weigh because she is my goals
Stan and Richie sound considerably older than they did in the film haha
this video should've been longer bc all 7 of them were actually in it!
Why did that gorgeous young woman cut of almost all of her hair?
I watched the new IT movie today omg I love it
The movie was so good, but the kids were the best part. They were hilarious
stranger things kid got a whole weirdo but philosophical thing goin on
lol the It cast is probably one of my favorites
They should take over teenvogues snapchat bc i would watch the fuck outta that
Oh my I love these kids! With all of their different characters. Every single one of them is so good!
im just gonna say it, that kid with curly hair next to jack was a bad actor
One time back in 7th grade I was talking to my teach but my brain was in like 12 different places so as we were walking off I accidentally said bye I love you to her and just ran off
They're all so cute!
God, they are so cute.
Finn looks completely different and sounds different as well.
i stan them all now
Jeremy looking into the camera at 0:33 killed me
Playing in the sandd
I really need a Jack kind of person in my life lol
I LOVE CHOSEN SO MUCH GAHH
ive called a lot of my teachers and friends mom b4 lol.
WHEN THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE TOILET PAPER ON UR SHOE AND FINN HONKS AT JACKS JOKE LMAO IM LAUHJGIN
I freaking love these kids. If I could be friends with all of them I would. XD
when i was little i used to called one of my teachers mom
the movie is out now so the IT cast is dead ???
Everyone's talking bout Finn or Jeremy and I'm just like JAEDEN
THEY ARE SO CUTEEEE I'm in love with the short one 😍
They're all so ugly.. wow (the black guy is alright tho)
I want another movie of this entire cast. I don't care what the plot is. I need more! Also I kind of love Finn
Jaeden I don't like shopping either 😂😂😍😍😘😘🎈😊
drooping your phone on the concrete happen to me before i picked it up i was oh no! because i knew how it was going to be before i pick it up
How is jack and jaeden so cute?! 😂😂love u both!
Man this cast is fucking amazing
Jeremy and Jack are the loves of my life
Bro the movie isn't that scary it more funny
I think I called Jeremy mom the other day- Anyways.\n\n*Jeremy looks into the camera like the Office*
1:23 I listened with my headphones on I thought it was a gun shot outside😶
When there's no more toilet paper 😭😱
2:12 I agree with you 1000%
This movie was awesome. I am in love with this cast! Fantastic!
This entire comment section is extemely cringy and creepy.
I want to say all of this people are adorable but I'm pretty sure they're my age 😂
I'm literally in love w/ Jaeden.
Sohpia was actually pretty hot with the long hair
1:15 that laugh gives me life
Imagine how awkward it will be if they did the sewer scene from the book ...
lol jacks the dumb one
They're all so cute and i'm over here looking like a half eaten sweetpotatoe.
Jeremy looks like a young James Corden
i love sophia and finn's aww at the start 😂😊
What's worse being home alone at night, Or staying up after your mum goes to sleep
I love them so much
finn looks nervous at the start
Jack reminds me so much of myself when I was younger, here and even in the movie.
Jeremy is the cutest the little thing ever 💜
I love them sm
jack is my favorite
JAEDENNNNN!!!! I'm a fannnn!! <3333
If you need advice from a savage go to this time 1:40
JACKKKK😍😍😍
Wow these scenarios aren't really scary
Jack is soooo cute wtf
I call everyone mom \n\nSame dude same
finn looks so good omg 😍.
O finn é o mais bonitooo❤!
Jeremy Reminds me Jack Black
Finn ❤❤
FINNS LAUGH OOOOOOOH
Wheeze at 1:14 am dead💀💀💀😂
They're so goshdarn cute
Jack the best
JACK IS THE FUNNIEST

Raining blood

I love jeaden
Laik si buscabas un comentario en español y el mio te saco una sonrisa :v
The only overcooked thing here was dan's pasta
IRL version of this during spooky week, can you imagine? \nPhil: Pass me the whisk Dan! \nDan: *remembers every traumatising things he's seen that has to do with whisks*\nPhil: ....Dan? The whisk? \nDan: .... *just plays spooky scary skeletons in the background*
Phil is me when I get excited / confused. Just run around not knowing what to do.
I know it's not a game, but can you react to An Ordinary Battle Amongst Familiar Hills?\n\nI bet you'll love it
The bit of Dan's hair that sticks up out of place is literally me
Phil what happened to that tomato you threw on the floor I want answers I'm invested in this narrative
btw Daniel Howell I notice your main channel  art display is not in the center. It kind of make me a bit of discomfort. Just move it a little to the left. plz....
I got an ad!
Dan sounded so manly when he said bitch
Dudes, you made me snort my soup... \nWhich I cooked while drunk...
now i want soup since its raining really hard right now
yall already know the wholesome festive cooking is gonna end up being competitive and not wholesome past the intro
I love how you just talk at the same time all the time. 😂
I want to be in the next livestream!
I am Gordon Ramsey and you are FUCKING HORRIBLE!!!! THIS SOUP IS RUBBISH!!!!!! GET YOUR FOOKING LIFE TOGETHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1!!11!!11!111 YOUR ONION PASSING WAS AMATEUR AND YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PROFESSIONAL DAMN IT!!!!!!!1!!1!!!!1!!!!1!111!!!!!!
It’s almost time for SPOOKY WEEEEEEK! I can’t wait!
Phil saying yes chef actually triggered me to my days as a busser/food runner which I quit because the manager made me cry 😅
Tyler Isn't real it's josh you dipshit
For dan vs phil you should do a thing, if the person says all or nothing and they lose the winner chooses a punishment
i got an add my guys, you done good
Shut your mum - Phil\nFinally Phil has a comeback against Dan..... Waiting for your move Dan (^.^)
When the soup set on fire, I was reminded of when Dan said he set fire to pasta and I started laughing hysterically
I left a comment, here you go, enjoy this comment.
Dan whining about pressing the button is my Aesthetic™
I'm in the crappiest of moods and they still made me laugh!
when you thought it was an early cooking video and then realize it's on the gaming channel
I got an ad it was 6 seconds non skippable about dying grey hair, love those targeted ads😂
quickly reminder that im indeed a furry
It really bothered me that Dan had the blue character while wearing a red shirt and Phil had the red character while in the blue shirt
Um... Am i the only one who got an add or...
Phil to answer your question - soup is mostly made up of broth which is meat flavored tea therefore it is a drink
I was screaming when no one was chopping 😂😂
I hope there's a Gordon Ramsay character in this game and just scream at the other player
I'm just sat here alone screaming PLaTe!! He needs a PLATE Phil! P-L-A-TE
Who would of thought that Dan screaming would fix my headache
he protecc \nhe attacc \nbut most importantly \nhe PASS THE ONIONS
*as a small child* do the thing.... phil... *expactant look* -phil- ? -Dan- the thing... do the thing
Dan: Phil I wanna-I wanna click the thing\nPhil: What thing?\nDan mumbling: the thing the thing *gestures* \nPhil: OHHHHH\n \nHow long it takes my friends to get my jokes... if you play that 50000000000000 times again... my friends are dumb XD
Please more Overcooked! This was absolutely great!
You're just making me do it, you say something! \n\nDan: *screams* PASS THE ONIONS \n😂❤️👌🏻 quality
I just love Dan screaming PLATE PLATE PLATE
Well, at least it wasn't \n\n\n\n\n\n*RaAaAwWWw*
OH MICROPHONE .. IT'S ONE THICC PHONE
Orange you glad they lettuce be in their video. Because I yam and this is eggcellet.
ugh why did you put an ad in, i hate spoons
he protec\nhe attac\nbut most importantly,,\nhe bring the tomato bac
Y E S C H E F😩👌💦
My dogs name is Kevin....
DAN STOP TALKING WHEN PHIL'S TRYING TO TALK YOU LOSER OMG
_the furry representation that gaming needs to be providing_ as a furry, I'm proud of dan :3
Dan's voice got so high pitched when he yelled at Phil to FINISH CHOPPING
your LOTR reference gave me life for a minute
WAIT I'VE JUST REALIZED... DANANDPHILGAMES IS ALMOST AT 3 MIL SUBS
SHOUT ME OUT BECAUSE I LOVE YOU DADS ❤️❤️❤️
Dan's *PHIIIIIIIILL* gets me every freaking time
The quality of this is was A+, so much better.
Omg I work at Starbucks I feel so represented
the birth of the afterchat
Palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy. He's nervous- because on the surface of the pan the soup is ready- sentient spaghetti.
It's the le gaming channy
Dan hasn't gone a single video without mentioning furries should we be concerned
The whole time I was thinking where's the lamb sauce!!!!!!! 
I'm excited for S P O O K Y  W E E K!!!
I'm screaming at my screen...because two English men are playing a cooking game...and PHIL FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, YOU ADORABLE SWEET POTATO!! GET. A. PLATE!!!\nWhat is my life?
I LOVE DAN AND PHIL
I couldn't handle all the stress I almost soiled the chair...
This guy's a right pleb that sounds so British????
NOTICE ME TOL BEAN SEMPI'S also Dan chill the heck out my eardrums cant take much more of this
How deep can yo go?🤔😝😌
I'm going to start saying 'yes chef' passive aggressively to my *wonderful* English teacher (no sarcasm there, what?) and see how long it takes for me to get a detention
of *fucking* course the whisk is rainbow
i'm leaving a comment to hopefully be in the next video :)) \ni love you both.
how i wish actual cooking were just chopping three bits of something and boiling\n\nbut hey, at least i never forgot to add water to boil my pasta, eh?
I didn't know I had to finish chopping!!\n-Phil Lester while dan is screaming FINISH CHOPPING!!!!
this is incredible and El Shit is my aesthetic
Please play more of this!!
Play Roblox PLZ
You should play slime rancher!!
*_SOUP AND NEAT_*
Hey guys

THE ANXIETY
How old is this girl she looks in her late thirties honestly
She doesn't have any lips
huma is waaay prettier than this ted cruz beached whale. what's wrong with men? jesus
Anthony Wiener. That last name tho
Good job coming forward though set him up but oh well he should be set up dirty mother f***** knew you were underage
Thank you Anthony Weiner... thank you young millennial. You liberals finally did something wonderful for your country. Takes my hat off and vows down dinner is on me. Now let's make America great again.
When the wiener scandal first broke out, I was absolutely terrified. I couldn't sleep the whole night. How will we ever be able to explain this to our children?? The Wiener scandal was one of the most traumatizing events in recent history for Americans.
My mother looks more like a teenager then she does...!
Shes ugly as hell she needs a nose job, lip injections and a weight watchers program
she looks like she was a woman then turned into a  man then was like never mind then turned back into a female
I am so immature...why did I laugh when she said Weiner God...why?!
What did she think? His last name was Wiener
Good for her! Catching a pervert before he goes into office! <3 <3 <3
She basically set him up tho.
SHE LOOKS LIKE A FAT JOHN CUSACK IN A WIG! No offense John!
Ewwwww I'm not trying to be shallow but, ew. She nasty!!!! I wouldn't touch that slob with a 100ft pole. Her or Weiner. They both fugly.
She doesn't look like a teen!!!
She kind of looks like Kevin from the office
He has it written in his name
His wife is so much prettier lol
She looks like a female version of TED CRUZ 😫😂
Dang!!! She is UGLY!!!
LMAO WEINER
ow, now its weiner's fault, LMFAO\nwhats next, harambe did it ?
Them legs would make any weiner feel different
She was disgusted.... shut yo hoe ass up... just thinkin about that check 💰 💰
She's also old enough to know what's right and what's wrong.
I see you ted Cruz!!!!
Lol she looks like a 40 year old it's disgusting he did that but he didn't know she was a minor too
So anthony weiner was sending dick pics to ugly fat chicks?? He's much sicker than I thought.
HIS LAST NAME IS WEINER.  THAT CANT BE A COINCIDENCE!! HIS.... NAME.... IS.... WEINER. I CANT BREATHE 😂😂
she entrapped him hoping to get a big pay day basically
man, she isn't even hot. now Japanese chicks in school uniforms is HOT!!!!!
this girl better be careful that she doesnt end up as another name in the long list of Clinton's Bodybags. if she hasnt already.
You mean to tell me she's not a 39 year old mother
she looks like Ted Cruz, if he became a woman
🤢🤢🤢 Please this chick new exactly what she was doing....let not act like she was innocent...she set him up yes he was wrong but so was she
Well the name WAS Anthony Weiner
This is what Ted Cruz would look like if chose to transition to woman.
She's got more Chins than a Chinese phone book
I can't be the only one who laughed at thosd dramatic poses ☠☠☠\nThrough the application twitter 😂😂😂
wow this is why i don't trust a girl or a woman they set you up in ruin your life
I thought that was Debbie Gallagher
She probably like it and wanted it😂like look at her😂
So her reason was I knew Hilary Clinton would be running for president in 2016. So she was setting him up for that crime starting in 2015? But she does look like an ugly desperate girl who likes dick pics. I'd like to read their entire exchange since she wanted to reignite a controversy and ruin Hilary's chances.
She ain't even worth it anothny tf atleast text someone's who's hot.
Gross. Couldn't he pick a better looking one
She a minor?? She looks 30
Stupid thot because of her ugly ass Hilary wasn't president
She's a Russian spy
I don't know if it's just me but she doesn't look like a teen!
This dumbass risked his whole entire career for her😂 I would understand if she was hot but, 🤔
Teen? Teenager ?? I thought she was 30-40 oops
Hillary Clinton threw her campaign into a tail spin
She's one of the most hated women in America
She looks 35 she can't be a minor
So in January 2016 she knew that if she could get Anthony W. to send a photo she could use that against Hillary Clinton in November??
She looks like she's 40 and ugly why would he even do that
I guess the global warming got to him
He is such a Weiner!
You all know that this is really Natasha Fatale former spy from Pottsylvania now working for the Russian government.
His name says it all
His last name tho....
she's ugly af.
Pass😂😂

Good day,\nI love you content and you have helped me gain more passion for baking and I thank you for that.

After watching all of your videos I finally got some candy molds, cake tins, food coloring, transfer sheets, and a BUNCH of other supplies; wish me luck on my journey! My first few attempts at tempering my chocolate didn't go well, so I had to refrigerate my truffles and distribute them quickly before they melted, but my friends were happy all the same. XD

Mendy you are a star
Such a funny guy, love you, Mendy.
I absolutely love this lad
Leroy sane on first eleven please. And gudoghan has to play.
Why are people laughing at his accent or English? At least he is trying, it will improve quickly.
mendy's an absolute beast. so jelly you lot got him!
the way Mendy plays kinda reminds me of Micah Richards in his prime, the LB version of course. Especially in that 11/12 season. Both are funny as well.
Nice to see manchester city players can speak English..
Biggest win since 70 years? Really? U existed back then? I thought Est.2008
This man is a game changer! EXACTLY what we needed!
I didn't understand any thing
The reporter is so weak 😕😕
He sounds like google translate with a French accent 😂😂
Aguero best striker in the league
Top class player, so powerful
is he talking english?
he speak english he speak french i do not know 😂😂😂 he's English fani😂😂
Great game. This guy will compete with Kevin for the assists in the team. His accent tho...
What a game, I was working tending bar... never spilt so many pints while serving!
Ain't even a city fan and I love this man
Ederson won us the game.
please get a new interviewer his voice makes me want to kill myself
What did he say when he said he was joking about Ederson? I couldnt quite catch it with the french accent. Anyway, Mendy what a top bloke!
How is this interviewer still at City?! Terrible!
Wt ajoke mendy he run like old lady just wait for few games #ripmendy

Big up Benjamin Mendy! A legend in the making.
nice to beat the professional victims.c.t.i.d.
I just love it when the French speak English... :p
I'd really like Benjamin to wear number 10 after Kun left/retire. Just for banter lol
We all love man city
Our squad is so much better than last year!!! Mendy's crossing is world class!!! Ederson is also solid and has a comforting presence when he is in net, and different feeling than when Hart and Bravo were in net
Mendy and yaya work class player..and all team man city work class .fantastic game..I love alll
Mendy is absolutely brilliant..without a doubt the best Left back in the league.
he's a boy from the favelas (ederson), so he;s use to it lmaooooo
Down to earth guy
Benjamin you played a skilled well fought game.    We fans are all behind you, keep up the good work.
Better English than Kane and Rooney 😂😂
What a way to break our winless run against the Reds! Annihilation at the Etihad! Let's Go City!
this guy is a fookin monster!
Please upload a video on Ederson's well being. He was the WARRIOR of the match today !\n\nSuch a wonderful day for Man City !\n\n1) Aguero becomes the highest non-european goal scorer in premier league history.\n2) Mendy debuts at the Etihad stadium.\n3) Both the goalkeepers had clean sheet today.\n4) City got a huge victory after a long time(since 1937) against Liverpool (5-0)!!!
Friends Suscribe to my channel of football 👍👍👍👍
hes already won over so many city fans with his smile
he looks like a bronze figure!
He already speaks good english 😃
Come Manchester City your the best well played Pep
He said Ederson was a boy from the favelas so he was used to that kind of aggression 😂😂😂
Anyone else getting a Micah Richards vibe from mendy. Great performance lads keep it up #GiveThemHell
Where is my interview?
I wish for safety of Ederson from Japan.
danilo was good at defensive midfield

2 matches played and already a fan favourite :)
A-?? It's for sure better than that.
Didn't enjoy the movie at all. Felt like I saw a completely different movie than everyone else.
U have a ridiculous tattoo. What happens when u turn 50? Huh?
still can't beat my top 3 Stephen King movies\n1. The Shawshank Redemption\n2. The Green Mile\n3. The Shining
If anyone knows who James Charles is, he said he hated IT because there was too much character development, plot development and not enough jump scares. Seriously, screw him.
Sorry man but the movie isn't worth an A-. Watched it, didn't love it, liked it, but it's more of a C+ at best. More of a discount night kind of movie.
Did the grownups *know* ??? Cos it kinda seemed like they did and accepted it and that made it even more evil
I'm SO happy bev didn't get down with everyone that's so strange like wtf lol
Chris, I would love for you to do a review on Stand By Me :)
well i think the book ending for chapter one is justifiable enough. Like it's almost a settled debate why bev does that exact thing.
It was well made and the characters were charming, but it wasn't scary, just made me jump a couple of times. The comedy didn't always land for me except the gazebo part. There was a bit too much dwelling on their group relationship which past a certain point was unnecessary and dragged the film down, and the whole mullet bully plotline was stupid and dumb in the direction it went. 6/10 for me
Unfortunately, nobody can top the original Tim Curry 1990 IT. I watched this movie tonight with high expectations, although they were more accurate with the original book information than the original but........\n\nIn the end, this movie didn't creep me out the way the original did. The acting(besides Beverly and Richie) in this new one were just terrible and had almost no believably whatsoever. \n\nOverall, I give this new one a Solid B at best.
It was good but... by the 10th jump scare I got bored.
Tim Curry was and is the best IT clown.
The movie was good. It's not scary at all... but definitely its a very good and entertaining movie  ;)
I LOOOOVED IT. (no pun intended)
Really? I just watched it today and I was yawning through the whole movie. I'm scared of clowns and I was pretty bored through out the film. The characters were really good I do give it that. I had a lot of laughs but scary?! No.
It wasn't a really scary movie like I thought it would be, but I thought it was still pretty good. It was more like a coming of age kid film with some scary clown bits
Just saw IT. aAnd that shit was sick!!\nGonna see it again for sure. 🤡🤡
Good movie, but I mean, the CG done when he moves was just garbage, ugh..
I will agree that the kids did an okay to a good job acting. However, I didn't believe that most of them were friends. They didn't sell the friendship in this version which it needed to. Also, I don't agree at all with the love for Pennywise here. He was way too much jump scare and the CGI was bad. Plus the voice just felt silly not scary. Tim Curry was terrifying because he made fun of their fear. Go ahead and run it won't do you any good, girly boy. He let the fact he could kill them at any second sink in. In this movie he just chased them and didn't really interact. Also, that ending where they just wail on him? No mention of a strong magical force helping them, just straight up street fighter his ass.
It was not scary at ALL! It was like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory . Although sink blood scene was scary .
This movie was definitely damn good as all get out but it actually didn't scare me even a little bit, though then again I have been a gigantic horror movie buff for well over 20 years and have seen pretty much every horror movie known to man, so that MIGHT have something to do with it too lol!! But definitely a truly amazing and suspense-filled movie and then some, I give it an A+ all the way across the board!!
i thought it was goin to be a different type of scary movie, it was more funny then scary, the trailer threw the whole movie off of what it really was
They hardly got a single thing right from the book are you kidding? From the very beginning the piano is playing the wrong song. The mother played Fur Elise and stopped doing so after Georgie died. Now i liked the couple Easter eggs like the Turtle toy and a couple others but other than that it wasn't true to the book at all. The entire movie was all jump scares using visual jump scares and audio jump scares. There was no real creap and terror, not to mention Pennywise wasn't alluring and sneaky thus he wasn't scary. And after allll of that, they DID NOT make the people of Derry the scary part and show how fucked up the town was (Like you said they did). They had a single scene showing the actual people of Derry being shady. They also didn't explain why Henry was carving his name into Bens stomach, which there was a reason for, it wasn't just a random thing that happened. I could go on for literally ever about what was wrong with the movie but i'll save myself the effort.
8/10 Georgie shouldve came back at the end
Just got back from seeing the movie, scared the shit out of me. Bill Scarsguard was great as Pennywise, his voice was creepy as hell!
Why did you ignore, or rather, chose to skirt around the fact that the scares are jump scares?
Dude the IT isn't a demon IT's an alien.
I thought this film was terrible
The clown reminded me of simple jack, a few of his scary faces looked like someone with severe autism. A few other minor issues like the old well house looking cliche as fk and some scenes didn't transition/flow very well to the next but the positives far outweigh the negetives. Against other horrors- 9/10, against citizen kane- 6/10 .
I would like to be friends with adult Beverly
I just found the original series boring, seriously creepy clown in a drain , also stranger things is shit to, it's not scary , its a film/ tv show all the kids can watch with mum and dad. More Money
This movie was really good go watch it if u haven't seen it I didn't get scared but that's cuz I'm not afraid of movies but it's a good movie
Pleases her friends...? What the fuck
I live in Miami Florida. I evacuated and now staying in New Orleans, and still went to go see this movie.
This movie had some creepy parts in it. But that God damn creepy woman from the painting scared the living shit outta me. Especially when she comes scurrying out of the sewers
that nes that nes i love that nes
I watched the movie today and IT was amazing! Hahaha see what I did there? Anyway, the actor who played Pennywise the Clown Bill Skarsgård deserves an Oscar nomination I think because he was that good! His performance was chilling, funny, terrifying, and downright breathtaking! I would like to see Bill Skarsgård in more movies because his performance was amazing! Highly recommend the movie IT!!
Hey Chris, I'm a big fan of your work. Your review of It seems to be on par with other reviews I've seen. I thought the movie was okay, but not nearly as great as all of the reviews say it is.\nI was wondering if I posted a video response pointing out all of the problems I had the with the movie, if you would do a rebuttal on the movie's behalf. It's not your opinion or review score you'd be defending, but the movie itself. Thought it would be fun.\nAnyway, keep up the good work!
came. back from the movie theater, wow,  I was on the edge on my seat
Disagree. Massively over-hyped film. Saw it with my 17 yo daughter. Nobody in the theater was scared, nobody. The Tim Curry original is far superior. Andy Muschetti's other film MAMA, is genuinely terrifying. The new IT also suffers horribly from trailer fatigue, wit the best parts jack hammered in trailers for the last 6 months. It's not a bad film, but falls way short of what was expected.
Is this a sponsored video? It feels like things are going to pop out... are you being serious? Almost all of the jump scares are very predictable, the scene that truly made me jump was when Beverly smashed his dad and IT showed ITself.
Why didn't you talk about how funny the kids were?
Was better than I thought it would be but definitely still think Curry was WAY better as Pennywise
I was never scared just creeped out.  Still excellent movie though!
Sorry gonna have to disagree with you on this Chris. The children's fears seem under-developed and cliche as a result.  Honestly the child-acting wasn't great, and I did not think Pennywise was all that unique or horrifying.  I was completely unengaged by the story and some of the CGI was absolutely awful. Overall there was no sense of horror or dread, and it really made this movie seem hollow.
this is such an amazing movie
The movie wasn't that scary and I could tell some parts were cgi. I went watching it believing the hype. Waste of time and money.
Why are people praising this film? It was garbage
Took your word ... movie was trash tho 🤔
the movie was great and very funny but no where near scary at all its. I personally think the movie is bullshit.
Plz do a review on Jigsaw when it comes out
Bill skarsgård was epic as pennywise. Next iconic movie monster
This movie was really good. But there was something about it that really bugged me. Red Letter Media also talked about it, the obnoxious sound design. Most of the scares were just really loud noises. Aside from that, it's a really good movie.
I loved everything about this movie. For horror movies we need great stories like this and this director delivered just as the actors did.
One of my favourite books of all time. Hopefully this movie will do it justice!
What is the DVD release date for this movie, IT?
This movie was almost complete perfection and practically blew my expectations out of the water. Great movie.
it's always difficult and awkward to hate on kids in films\n\nno it's not
1M views already, good stuff man
Review the original
Balls
Rock war.........
Totally agree with you in every way--except that Tim Curry was good.  The miniseries was SO HORRIBLE.  Definitely agree about the sexual scene with Beverly.  Totally wasted pages in the novel.
Hmmm, guess I could give It a chance :---D
You are a shill
I LOOOVVVVEEEDDDDDD THIS IVE BEEN TWICE AND IM GOING AGAINNNNNN

They mix the fear of clowns and have the 80s hype. I say this movie sucks, but will probably go see it.
Loved this video. Great review. I made a short review of the film which is on my channel if anyone fancies checking it out. That would be sick. 😊
Chris, your videos are always spot on. I've even got your book, and I can't wait to watch every movie in it and read the reviews. I'm working on my own movie review blog, check out my It review at https://danielsmoviereviewsblog.wordpress.com/2017/09/12/it/ !
Watched just now.... and loved it
I watched it 2 days ago...Omfg this movie....IS AMAZING HOLY SHIT
it was a good movie im really not scared of clowns so maybe thats why i wasnt that scared which is weird cause im usually scared of scary movies i just dont think it was that scary. would i watch it again? Yes i would but i would have to be taken to it or on a date with somone just so then i have a reason to go.
When pennywise was just talking in his normal form i absolutely loved it. He was so good but the cgi scary pennywise almost took me out of the moment but thats not bill skarsgard's fault he was great. Defiantly exited for chapter 2.
If you think IT is scary you are a pussy bitch 😂
It was shit
I liked it mainly for the performances and good script, but there were too many dumb horror cliches shoved into scenes that just had no impact
Okay so here me out On this one. \nIn the original and the book when they are facing off against pennywise in the sewer Eddie say this is battery acid you slime and sprays his inhaler in his face and it melts him and later when he tries this as an adult he is killed. I was looking forward to the this in the remake but it didn't happen but the I thought about it and they gave this moment to Richie in the remake when he grabs the baseball bat so that makes me think they r gonna kill richie in the  at the end instead of Eddie??????
Saw this last night, SUPERB ! Far better than it should have been, far exceeded my expectations. So the creature 'IT' is a demonic entity ? Is this confirmed ? Always wondered exactly what 'IT' was.  Anyway, i loved it was set in the 80's (got Goonies/ET vibe), that haunted house was just so good .......too much comedy for me though not enough cool music (minor gripes). Bill Skarsgard nails the performance. I believe Sophia Lillis is going to be an amazing actress, was blown away by her.
Fuuuuck I'm not going to be able to see this the in the theater
I went and watched this last sunday....this is the first horror movie tht actually made me screamed... Like seriously screamingggg!!!..but all so very satisfied.... God i really like Eddie and Billy... Their are so cute. To those who hvnt watch this...1000% recommended this to every single person on the planet. 9.7/10 rate.
At first, I really liked this movie. A lot. \nIt didn't really scare me. I get that the horror could be viewed as the icing on the cake. I jumped at the jump scares, but that's because if you see something pop up in front of you, you're gonna jump. You're kinda programmed to do so. It didn't really leave me with a lingering fear though. I kinda just went home and had a good night's sleep and then didn't think about it. I actually got home and thought Well, that was a good movie. I probably won't remember it in a few years, but I enjoyed the experience. \nThere were multiple scenes I liked. The intro was good. The scene where Bev was sobbing and cutting her hair off after her father compliments it is amazing. The scene where the blood comes out of the sink was good. I liked Richie's jokes. The cinematography in many places was great. The special effects were great too. The acting was great, good casting all around.\nBut there were times when Pennywise seemed more funny than scary to me. I couldn't help but chuckle to myself at times when he was onscreen. \nThe more I thought about it, though, the more I realized it was kinda a paint-by-numbers movie. My rating got worse the more I thought about it. Now I'm just kinda at a Meh, I liked it kinda feeling. Not great, not bad, just pure entertainment for a quick thrill.
Anyone who says this isn't an excellent movie can seriously fuck off. What were you watching? Do you have a brain? Do you understand film and creativity in general? These are questions you need to ask your delusional ass
Wait you gave Damn a 7/10, but this an A-??? C'mon, Melon.
So uhh.. they thinking bout making a Stephen King universe or what? I mean IT and Dark Tower do take place in the same universe, not sure bout the movies though.
The 90s mini series was way better than the 2017 film.
Man! This video has a million views!
DO A SPOILER REVIEW
unsubbed. you sold out
Cool. Very cool.
That Georgie opening tho
Pennywise is fucking scary.
GREAT review.
You're a faggot.
Chop chop
the sink scene though!!!
i certainly didn't dislike the movie but i was apparently the only one in the theatre not frightened. last horror movie to actually creep me up was the ring. the creepy as girl coming out the well was all kinds of wrong lol.
spoiler question: if pennywise plays off fear (can't hurt you if you're not afraid) how does PW eat the first kid....he wasn't scared. horrible movie....disjointed.
You two are SUCH A CUTE COUPLE!😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍💖💖💖💖💖💖❤❤❤😂😁😁😁😁😇😇😇😇

Hello\nIf you like the video, then follow me auf Social Media. LOS! \nThe link ist in der Description.\n\nDanke
This shit cracks me up!!! I dated a German girl who ranted about the EXACT SAME thing years ago. I love Germans, y'all so serious about everything:)
The problem with suddenly pronouncing things the way they are originally meant to sound is that everyone then thinks you're a cunt.\nImagine joining a conversation with some friends about Paris, but every time you speak you say Paree.  Thats right.  Noone wants to talk to you anymore.\nHowever the fact that some people can't pronounce Audi right IS fucked.  I'm looking at you, America.
BMW= British Motor Works.
Lol...it's Bayrische MotorEN Werke... not Motor
It's pronounce THis not ZISS. Get it right! Good night!
This video is golden.
What kind of fucktard would pronounce Audi as OH-DEE? I'm American and that makes no fucking sense to me. There's a fucking A and a U, neither of which make a fucking OH sound in English or German.\n\n\nSeriously if you hear someone pronounce Audi as OH-DEE *beat them to death*, because they're likely alien imposter in human form.
jeder weiß ...HAHAHA!
No your going to tell us
this is pretty much the same how we say it in swedish lol
Sounds similar as we pronounce them in spanish, except for BMW.
In Spanish we say it just like in German, it's the same xD
I agree with you. I seem native English speakers can not understand one other.
In finland we already pronounce the names right.
Lol in romania is just like in germany the pronuntion
I remembered just enough from my Deutsch classes that I knew these - but this was really enjoyable :) Danke schön :)
auf der heide blüht ein kleines blümelein
something something different languages
Subscribed! Hahaha! Do American car brands next and let's see how they react.
If you have a faulty BMW it is a Bayerisch Mist Wagen
We indians pronounce it correctly
Danke Sehr.
Vot Du Ferkin Vos Dat.
Smh
geniess dein Calanda :D
wunderbar
He sounds like fps Russia
Haha German :)
Genial!
I did Nazi that
Let me get this straight. This guy is angry because other countries pronounce German car names the wrong way? At the same time, he's pronouncing English words the wrong way. Big fucking LOL to that!
Sorry but nobody yes NOBODY pronounces Audi as Ordi. Not even in England lol
this is not beer, this is peepee water, because it is swiss. lol. im a german hanging out in grenchen/swiss
What is the song name?
Dude, what's wrong with your arm?
How do I pronounce Michael Schumacher?
Where did you get a SharpSpring shirt? I work there.
Fun thing is my parent is actually German so i already know this when i was 5 years old
The one thing I didn't already know was the quick version of Volkswagen in German
You have the OPEL one completely wrong!\nIt is pronounced VAUX HALL!
Well at least I can pronounce squirrel
If i say it wrong the Nazi police will come get me, and this video proves it lol.
It's pronounced Drumpf, not Trump!
sorry
What a shame he got it wrong.  BMW stands for Bayerische MotorEN Werke - not Bayerische Motor Werke.    Failed again
ok, then please spell all foreign brands the right way and we'll do the same ... oh right ! you can't !
Calanda bräu z beschda wo's je häts gits
this was fun :)) \nbtw, in the description of the video you wrote propery, instead of properly
You forgot to explain how Mercedes-AMG is pronounced! Btw very useful and funny as hell video :P
Bester Mann! :D sehr geile Aktion ^^ mach weiter mit den guten Videos und eine gute Woche dir !
I lofe your backkround muzik, Adolf! 🖕
I guess it's supposed to be a joke. Because complaining about how people pronounce a name in their own langage when the guy can't pronouce english with a correct accent is kinda ironic.
haha sooo funnnnnyyyy, not
I can't tell you how many things you pronounced in English wrong...  (shakes head)..
Welcome back U2 thank God.
I think this might be one of my new favorite songs. And that is not a light achievement. But still the video was unique and the song was incredible
The Very Best in The world
I love this song. Thanks, U2.
Omg new U2 song!! Yass!! 😂
Beautiful
Irish power!!!  👈🏽👊🏽💪🏾 Dublin proud 🇮🇪 👌🏾👍🏾 😍🔥😍
Kygo played a remix of this song last year in Bergen at his concert, and i've been waiting so long for this song to come out! And i LOVE it!!
I like it. Reminds me of old U2, which is a good thing. :)
I grew up on U2 songs and this is such a surprise for me :D
Are you also here because of Coldplay?
Thank you  so much,   a continuation of the last album
... both this one and Dark Necessities hint that rock music may have gone for good
I think.. that U2 without brian eno cannot make it. so.. brian eno is without a doubt the BRAIN. of u2. and daniel lanois too of course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r2PS3W1eYc Like and subscribe my friend in this world. We ''re making good music just because our fans are very important to us and we want to bless them with love and great music
I can't get too into this song.. It might just be me, but it has this constant build up that just doesn't go anywhere.
Bono still going hard
The best....forever..
I can see you love her loudly when she needs you quietly wow
Legend!!\npeace and love from Indonesia.. <3
From your fuse you subscribe to the channel with my gift
The best of all GThe u to
Sucks ass. Nothing will compare to the U2 the 80s.
been U2 fan over 10 years; Im not feeling this one.
I haven't kept up with U2 since Songs of Innocence. Are people still mad at them for giving out *free shit*?
WHY DID I KNOW THIS CAME OUT UNTIL NOW
Pisses all over Songs of Innocence
I think it sounds great.
It's good, but they need to make an album like WAR again.
Like us on FB https://www.facebook.com/u2coholics/
2:22 they be like.. fuck the page turning. we're done. 😂
I love reading comments under songs from all different bands and learning what each fan base is like...What I learn here is that U2 fans are ignorant and sheltered
Nice song but I have to admit that I have heard better (and more interesting) songs from U2. I know that I am strict but I don't like to compromise with nice but simultaneously indifferent songs from my favourite rock band. I have been used to hear the best music from this band. \nI really hope that the rest songs from the album will be amazing.
Love it. 45 year old U2 fan practically since birth and am always happy when I hear the Edge playing some of his signature, haunting notes in the background; nowadays real musicians are hard to find and U2 are legends that continue to produce awesome stuff!
who knows how much time did it take for all those pictures to make and put all together into a video
Sorry to be a party killer, but this is a very average tune and it has a really tired  sound to me - but what annoys me the most is Bono's flat and uninspired lyrics on this track - light years from the level of their peak in the 90's. To be honest, IMHO they have not released anything remotely interesting since POP. The fact that their latest tour is on their 30 year old Joshua Tree album sort of confirms that they have accepted their irrelevance, even though they have always been amazing in concerts. But, in the 1990's, they (and Nirvana) ruled the music scene!
Good rock and roll, uh....music
Loving  The fly reference @1.47! This will blend in perfectly in an Achtung Baby celebration tour in 2021 ;)
This is my review on the  song https://ireviews25.blogspot.com/2017/09/youre-best-thing-about-me-u2-review.html
Wonderful song! Love U! See you in Brazil, october!
I loved it. U2 always :)
Weak song. They're music has been in slow decline since their last great album 2004's\nHow To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb
If this is a taster of the album then we can only expect something lukewarm and a little safe. When U2 stop giving a shit about being relevant then they'll write great music again. Great music is always relevant. They need to take more risks than this. I agree with a few others here, there is a lot of terrible stuff going on in the world, that's where U2 need to channel their energies. Protest songs, rebellion against Trump, against racism, the refugee crisis. Fucking hell, I dunno.
I love this video, what a hard work, well done!! congratulations to creators!!

Hello every body❤❤❤aba
<3
Why the hell when I search U2 on YouTube, U2 Justin Bieber comes as the second search suggestion? That's so annoying!
Melonboy didn't like this song , so I guess I don't like it too
wow, I love this song, I think I can never stop listening to it
the good band is back
Safe to safe u2 is the greatest band ever
Seriously, why are U2 still making new music?! This is the blandest, by-the-numbers song they have ever released as a single, and a lot of their music falls into that category. I listened to it, and the painful experience was only made worse by having the corny, back-of-a-fag-packet lyrics on the screen! Music as generic as this really winds me up. Dreadful. Empty, soulless music.
This is culture, people
can i get that book somewhere ?? lol
oh i love it!
Nice hit
Great Song <3
amaaaaazingggggg
Great!
👌👌
It's a far cry from War or Joshua Tree but they still sound surprisingly good for their age
AMAZING!!! You guys just get better and better!
Yep! The bois are back!
Amazing Guitar work... Coldplay vibes...Amazing song
Very Lame song
SHIT SONG
Favolosi
Fucking awesome riff.

bleh
Awesome! and this is not a girly pop song like some people says... if you look the lyrics it's more about the father-daughter relationship. Or maybe it's  a love song for all those mistakes we make everyday
Genial U2 🇲🇽🇲🇽

1:46 The Fly resurfaced!
I personally love the song - great melodies, insane bassline, great guitar work from The Edge and the perfect drumming that Larry Mullen Jr. is known for. \n\nSo far, I find that some people are a bit iffy about the song and I think I found out why. The song takes a left turn at the very end and finishes with a noticeable change in melody. This was undoubtedly done purposely (probably to minimize predictability), but some people are saying they like the song but  also say they don't like the way it ends. I noticed the change in melody at the end on my very first listen and it does throw you for a minor loop, but I genuinely love the song (and I'm a tough critic). Hats off, boys!!!
what the hell is that ! It is time to stop to make music if U2 has nothing to share, the energy is gone now, it is musically flat and dull. I was fan long time ago,,,
so we millennials are supposed to appreciate this shit just because its U2? Sure Jane
Empty....even worst than the Even better than the real thing or Dirty boots....it's a shame that Bloody sunday is on playlist for concerts...it looks like they are ashamed of some songs, particulary from No line.... or War. New kids on the block....Blackout is So close
They should have retired 10 year ago. This sucks
Love this song...im kinda not convinced...Yeah ok 30 years they came out with their Best album The Joshua Tree...Luminous Times...lol....the best....However it was also 20 yrs ago they released Pop.....yeah not the best...with research in the cover of the new Album,,,,,very Pop.....and they themselves admitted that Pop wasnt their best effort......just hope that they are not going to say....well this is how Pop should have sounded...cant wait for the album...but will be watching...lol
Incredibly boring, but that's U2 these days.
Does anyone know what this song means?? \nespecially 'the best thing that ever happened a boy ' I don't really get this part... \nI can enjoy this song without knowing this but I'm just too curious! help!!
🇧🇷
Awful.

U2 goes REM soppy.... how sad.
why listen to male geezers sing taylor swift when u can just listen to t swift?
Horrible
This is the magic of football. Money doesnt build a team spirit , a team build's a team spirit. Bayern with this kind of persistence will win both legs against PSG. MIA SAN MIA
No one expected that
Conclusions? You can surprise the world, but... Don't mess with Lewy.
Best game in history!!!
Borussia Dortmund 💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪 that's all that matters
Costa, so underrated.
When Lewy comes on the field,  thats when things start heating up...
Wow tense game I love bundesliga maaan also Douglas costa was beast 4 bayern was heavily involved in both goals mistake letting him go but he wanted a first team start n when you've got robben it's hard
Lew ?
The bundesliga is so underrated, I support rangers btw and Scottish football is hopeless now
Normal FIFA game tbh.
Pure Class.
Why the bald man still roaming around! oops is it from those days.
Rudy and Sule finally in Bayern now
Not a good time for this upload lol
nice video..\nthis kind of videos I love to see 😘
Douglas Costa is laughing from Turin...thank you Huth! 2-0
Baumann deserved to keep it at one - one
What a brilliant save!...by the goal post.
What happened to this announcer, I feel like I don't hear him a lot, he is amazing
Great way to show match highlights

That was a crazy match
It's a shame that Costa turned into an average player after 2015. What a great player he was back then.
Results like this are the real reason Bayern win the league year after year, these ground out results against tough opposition are essential to win any league.

The options for diffculty are 10/10
On the difficulty setting, remember it does say that it doesn't affect combat just every other aspect of your life.  So it's likely some commentary on black superheroes in the movies and not an actual game mechanic.  Cartman is also a tremendous racist so of course he's gonna say something like that.
pretty cool what they did with the difficulty slider
Only in South Park People Lmfao\n\nNo other animated show would have the balls to do this.... In any adaption including video games
GAME. OF. THE. FUCKING. YEAR.\n\nSOUTH PARK DOES IT AGAIN
5:44 This would explain why black people always die first in movies... They where playing on Ultra/Insanity/Legendary Difficulty lol
Some butts are certainly becoming fractured now
Love that brief moment of discomfort the game puts them through.
politics aside that is hilarious.
Why does this guy keep on talking over all the dialog ?
legend has it at highest difficulty you get shot and die as you start the game
Difficulty settings. Godlike
Me:*picks darkest skin and starts game*\n\nalso me :*gets shot and dies before the game even starts*
God would the dude on the left be more annoying. The show is offensive. get over it.
White people problems! Being forced, not being able to be white.
AHAHAHA I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL GO CRAZY ABOUT DIFFICULTY SETTING HAHAHA
There should be a secret super hard difficulty level where it turns you into a pasty ginger
5:41 Trey Parker and Matt Stone Seal of Approval.
Whites feeling uncomfortable, tumblr offended, Trey and Matt laughing. Should I also feel the collective white guilt even though In our little european country never was slavery, and if it was, we would be very probably the slaves of some western country?
The difficulty setting is making fun of people who take it serious.
what is funny wit southpark is, that token, the only black kid is actually the richest kids in southpark, and that is more the reason why he 'didn't fit in.. In one episode he brings other black kids to town and they're all rich lol.. while all the white kids are poor. so maybe they might subvert expectation if they go token's route? And if anything this is a satire on us and what we immediately jump to conclusions.
5:48 I'm gonna go now - LOL. That's the default response of a white man who wants to avoid the race issue.
Normal is Hispanic i guess.
I feel like the dev's are just trolling. It's prob just choosing skin colour but they named it difficulty just to fuck with people. If I'm right well that's South Park for ya (fucked up but brilliant)XD
I swear, if this was ANYTHING but South Park...! HAHAHA!!!
well I'm not getting this game just because of this racist slider.\n\nplus the previous south park game was a disappointment.
Wait is there only 3 classes now? I remember in some gameplay from a few months ago there was about 12, what happened?
When is this game coming out
I've just realized South Park has a token black character in the school... and his name is Token.
I heard any interaction with police gets you shot
i'm lack and i just wanna sayHell Yeah South Park!,Do it more....
What I love is that it doesn't really change the difficulty all that much.  The only differences are depending on your race you get more money or less and you get more racist dialogue.  And some other changes.  I love that this was just done to screw with people and I can't wait until October.  What I also love is Cartman saying that you're a newbie so you can only choose from 3 classes which means they'll have to be unlocked.  From what I seen on the classes section that were marked out,  there's like 8 other classes.
The Andy laughing in the background lol
That difficulty setting is just PERFECT LMAO.
I didn't know creating a character was this hard.
I'm sorry I'm gonna have to give this game a 0/10 because I can choose Jew as my hero persona
I'm here only for the part of difficult.
HAHAHAHAHA! That's the South Park !
I can't wait to see what it's like to play as a girl.
No wonder chef has a hard time in combat OPERATION HUMAN SHEILD
Quite a few years ago I worked with a man who was a practicing Christian who did not shield his kids from South Park. He watched it with them, explaining that coarse language was the result of a limited vocabulary/education. And since there was no way to avoid it, the best thing to do was explain it. Besides, he said the Morals of the stories at the end were of substance. This man is one great dad. To this day, I avoid the F-bomb among others in an effort celebrate literacy.
not city beef it's shity beef
Is it actually true that gameplay is different when different genders, skin colour, etc are chosen? Or is it just a bunch of Canadian hockey hububaloo
Hey! Hardest should be snow white. Ginger lives matter.
Your character looks like a purple Jesus, I love it.
I am not sure if they are joking or just race baiting..
Can't wait for this game lol
Let's play a guessing game: You get a point if you can guess what part of the game gets censored/removed, with a bonus point if you also pick the country or region!\n\nMultiple reasons for one country and one reason for multiple countries still count as a point!
Who wants to bet the release date gets delayed last minute.
I don't care about children I care about cats!\n\nMy kind of woman
Don’t worry, this doesn’t affect combat, just every other aspect of your whole life.
Cartman Don't worry, this won't affect combat, just every other aspect of your whole life
their character looks like a lady-of-the-night TotalBiscuit
there are so many memes of the diffyculty slider imagine how many memes there will be of the game itself
This is normal is the opposite of what I say on a daily basis living in America in the year 2017.
ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK
Hello this game will have spanish subtitles?
We're both making it. **denies a veto on the awful child-beard**
I imagine that how uncomfortable Chris got with the difficulty slider is precisely the aim, so mission achieved I guess?
9:08 There is a bottle marked plutonium in Cartman's closet, but that's clearly Butter's Creamy Goo... hmmm......
You had me at satiric social commentary in a goddamn character creator.
having seen your guys playthrough at E3 I was hoping Aoife and Chris would do a full playthrough.  Aoife is so gung ho about the sick things that Southpark does and Chris is so disgusted by it all... it's halarious
That difficulty settings absolutely cracked me up.
That what i want to this game dont be correct against anyone pls :)
release it already
ahahahah
5:4 yw LMAO
I. Need. This
Lol the difficulty settings tho! 😂
5:42 - love it!
awesome!!!!
13:04 NOOO, I SHIP WONDER TWEEK X SUPER CRAIG :(
fuckn A, south park! 10/10
Natsu from Fairy Tail reference!! XD
😴
Jajajajaka xF
L O L
Ha ha ha, too fucking funny.
Better than Uncharted and that's a fact
Holy shit, that difficulty setting is amazing hahahahahaha instant GOTY XD
i love south park for this reason. As well as family guy. they make fun of everyone. fuck your feelings.
People in the comments: lmao, look at all the triggered white people here. They're so privileged, they just assume things about people's lives because they're too ignorant to look beyond their own.\n\nAlso people in the comments: The difficulty slider joke is so true. White people have it easy simply because they're white and black people have it really hard for no reason other than they're black. I know because I'm black.
I don't want to play it on easy, but I don't want to create a black character T.T
5:40 LUL
LOL This is brilliant
That difficulty slider is now the reason why im just gonna pirate the game lol gg nerds
Everyone's so freaking butt hurt over the difficulty settings. It's South Park! Did you expect anything less???
Does anyone know if the map is the same as the last game?
Oh well, I guess I will just mod the game, so I can play as white on high difficulty. Or won't buy the game at all, we'll see.
So, there will be no way to make the combat harder?
But....is the game actually out?? I need to know, please. I've been dreaming of getting this game since March
I think more games should do this, when it suits the themes of course. Not being Open-World for the sake of being Open-World
wait how did you get the game. I thought it was coming out on October?
Who is this cutie?
Easy mode will make life in the game more easy for the Alt Right Nazi, like real life lmao.
shes cute as hell
👁 ♥ her 🐈 2
I feel bad for white people choosing a difficulty, if they choose white they're racist if they choose black they're I'm not racist, I have black friends
This is some racist s***
make the difficulty setting a racial issue? ok im pirating this now. thanks.
in Jacksonville it's sooo much wind or windy so much lighting the sky is turning blue then normal and rain and I hear the wind and it's like the beach 3 like a four but it's a three and a four but Mathew oh god my neighborhood sing flew to cannad but we found it am so scared

Hope all the atheist are safe I didn't even loose power lmao sorry Christians
Tell Irma that North Carolina is ready for her
I'd do a nice number on her
Puerto Rico isnt called San Juan, it’s just the capitol of Puerto Rico. Why do they always get it wrong?
I just clicked this to look at that category 5 body
wtd your track is so different from everyone else's
Florida about to be Atlantis
1. That's wrong, it's going to hit the west coast of Florida.\n2. How is this trending, it haves inaccurate formation about the path of the storm.
Know who else is getting slammed? 😏
See I told you guys God is real God is powerful and he didn't Irma hit Florida as much

Harvey:HAHAHA I DESTROYED TEXAS\n\n\nIrma:Hold up,Nows my chance to destroy North Korea!\n\n\n\n\n\nBut seriously I hope the people in Florida are ok
I'm scared. I love Jesus Christ a lot but I'm afraid the world is coming to an end and there's so much things I haven't don't yet. I've been trying to get myself saved but it's too hard to fight temptations and other things. I pray for anyone in the way of Irma. I live in GA in Gwinnett so I'm not sure if it's coming my path but I pray God forgives all of our sins and he will take us up heaven. Oh lord have mercy on my soul❤️❤️❤️
Stupid Southerners and their shenanigans. First they make Americans look bad with their stereotypes and now they have hurricanes! I say the south gets cut off, crashes into Cuba and blows up.
Massive dick threaten Florida why is this the title
Irma how I like my girls, thick and white

You remember when TV announcers during Hurricane Harvey only talked about Corpus Christi, Rockport, and Port Arthur? But when the hurricane hit, they were all sobbing for Houston after the floods caused tremendous damage. After sitting here thinking about this, this might happen to Tampa.
I'm here for the comments
if your in Florida... TRY TO GET THE FUDGE OUT
Its already way past that point this is old
*We should take the State of Florida and push it somewhere else*
Well... I must be really worried about this hurricane 'cause I stopped watching 10 minutes of jungkook eating to watch this.

Lampsy <3
who else couldn't tell the difference between kylian and eden ahahah
Batshuyi always unserious, the boy need a good deliverance
Frank Lampard should be Chelsea manager\n\n\n\nLike i f you agree
Come on Chelsea 💙
It's kinda sad because all of my favorite player in Chelsea is no longer here like petr cech, lampard, terry, drogba, ballack, ashley cole
Miss you lampard . what a legend..
Kylian shot got saved. Lol
Kyle Scott next Iniesta lads.
Imagine 2 Hazards in our side hope his brother has the same skills
Good~ Lampard is Legend~ amazing~ Shoot~ Hazard also ~ super crack~
Why's Lamps wearing an Adidas shirt though? XD
I beg Christiansen starts, like how can he win Defender of the year twice in Germany and not play for Chelsea
Mark my word we found a GEM in zappacosta like we did with Alonso ...go watch his clip for Italy the other day he's a play making wing back like dani ALVES impeccable crossing
Why won't Conte give Mosunda a chance? He's better and dangerous than Willian, in my opinion!
Chelsea, the best football club in the world.
Please never lose Lampard, Chelsea! What a legend
Like if hazard is ur fave player
Sing with me!! Super super super Frank!! I wish club offers him assistant manager position for the first team
Omg it's so good to see him back.
If Lampard managed any other team I'd watch them win the title.
I hope Frankie manages chelsea in the future
Thor's daughter has signed for Chelsea!!! God help rest of the league :D :D
Kylian training with the first team 😍😍😍
N'golo is happy getting his partner back and serial crosser is now available to Chelsea as Davide\nKtbffh
All we need is Thorgan back at the club and we have an attacking trio that can do some serious damage!\n\nAlso \n\nSuper Frankie Lampard!
terrible interlacing on the video! sort it out video editor!
when you don't wanna be that guy that messes up the el rondo😂
hope that zappa, drinkwine and hazard play against the Foxes
Anyone else not buzzing that we've offloaded a lot of dead weight and brought in top players? Bakayoko looks unreal, drinkwater proven Prem player, morata looks class, rudiger will be a beast for us, brought back christensen and zappacosta looks a solid right wing back, happy ain't the word! Come on Chelsea! 💙
I love watching hazard play with himself... I mean brother!
Zappacosta looks genuinely excited be at the club, rare these days.
Like for the Frankie!!!
Hazard and his brother looking cute. No homo.
All we gotta do now is sign the youngest Hazard brother, Ethan, and we'll have signed every Hazard! It's just like collecting Pokemon. It's just a shame we let Thorgan go, because he's a pretty good footballer and would definitely help our squad out in terms of depth, especially nowadays. I'm not so sure about Kylian's talent though... He definitely seems like the weakest brother.
Not a bad life, a footballer's, hey? 😊
I think Conte will have selection problems this season.The squad has so many stars
Frank is the legend!
baba rahman started to train? \ni hope he can be moses 2.0,,,haha
Welcome to the winning circle Danny....
kante bakayoko fabregas drinkwater. who ll play against leicester. there ll be some rotation hope they happy play together.
Ive got shivers just from thinking how these young boys feels when they listen to and they looking at Frankie Lampard !\nNice to see Marcin having sessions with all these TOP players !
Kante and Drinkwater together again, COME ON BLUES
Drinkwater is playing his old team on his debut lol😃
So happy to see Lampard at Chelsea again, hope one day he will be coaching Chelsea
What's the latest news about diego costa?
Nice to see Lampard back at the club.
Eden 🔥
I like lamaprd
Lampard Legend
Miss you lampard
Kylian doesn't look half bad! Late bloomer ?
lampard
Where's Cahill?
HOPE DRINKWATER WILL PLAY AGAINST LEICESTER
My profile pic
Anyone else notice Lamps bulge
Imagine having players like essien, ballack and lampard to Danny drinkwater
Sign Frank Lampard
Kylian train with 1st team?
Super, Super Frank\nSuper, Super frank\nSuper, Super frank\nsuper super frank.
Good2see Lamps at cobham!
SUPER FERANKIE
แข็งแกร่งขนาดไหน คงสู้แมนยูไม่ได้แน่

kante smile and azpy smile true joys in life.
Love from india
Guys I'm not entirely clear. how soon can kylian hazard start featuring for chelsea?
hazard want,s madrid let him go prepare how to replace him that's what  is needed most.
Lampard the legend
I'am little bit confused about kylian hazard and eden hazard they both looking same
iPhone X: How The Newest iPhone Came To Be\n\nSimple.\n\n\nBy copying Samsung and Android in general.
Here comes something big *rolls in a brand new $1000 emoji machine*
Iphone X will be the future \nAnd will be welcome to my iPhone family
I got a. Samsung Note 8 ad before this video. Hahahahah
Worth waiting a decade for 1000$ 3D-emoji machine
first samsung copies apple, and now apple copies samsung.
So is Apple back or what?
Here comes something big lol, it's a phone that's slightly different than the one we got last year. Every single time a new iPhone comes out, it's labelled as a big leap forward. A big leap forward would be something as different and innovative to the iPhone X as the original iPhone was to the Blackberry Pearl at the time. Completely different. Removing a button doesn't make it different.
Of course we can fix it!\n\nNo, you have to get a new one.
iPhone X: How The Newest iPhone Came To Be\n\nWell.\nBy following Galaxy´s design.
People act like Apple didn't make smartphones the norm with the iPhone. Y'all can hate on it all day if you want but you wouldn't have your precious Galaxy or whatever else if Steve didn't pave the way. Js
My birth day is 2007 jan 9 and my first day old original iphone announced i sould have an iphone
It's not really big just a better camera, better specs and a screen that rivals Samsung's. If they had put a finger print reader on it at least that would have been good. I just dont think a screen is worth 1000.
*looks back at the first iphone* so many memories....\n\n\n\n\n\nI actually have the first iPhone and iPad still XD
This year's iPhone will have\n......get this......4 picture taking cameras!!!!omg omg omg omg *yawn*\n\nFor the low low price thats ALWAYS worth it....$1,599.00 dollars!\n\nUGH!!! SOMEONE NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT ALREADY!!!!!! FUCK!!!!
Iphone is so innovative in past but now...........
The something big is the price
My birthday is September 12th i know what im asking for
the payola is strong in this one
how the newest iPhone came to be\n\n-selfishness and copying :)
Litterally laughing off the removal of the headphone jack. How nice of you.
3:25 thats in shanghai i live near thar place
Still not worth hundreds of dollars.
Mass media lying to the public again. How much did Apple pay you to make this video?
Left out retina display that came with the 4.
Is this really something big? It seems kinda like fancy snapchat and apple playing catchup again.
4:05 the iPhone 6 was released in 2014 not 2013
The narrator in this is fucking cancer
apple lost its brain with steve jobs. so don't fart about apple has been trying to make this or that all along
cool video anyways I'm not trying to stick around for the flame war over whose magical multimedia rectangle is better for letting you shitpost dank memes gotta blast
Apple do not build their iPhone hardware! GLARING mistake
iPhone 5s was 2013.\niPhone 6 and 6 plus was 2014.
FYI iPhone 6 was announced in 2014
What about the IPods?
Apple is for sheeple.
Even as an Apple user I would say the video history lesson is a little distorted ... Pre-2007 there was a lot of HTC & other windows mobile phones.
Why am i watching this all i have is an ipod 4th generation that cant connect to wifi or let me use the bottom half of the screen
Wait this isn't an Iphone commercial?
This video made me realize how time goes by so fast from the ages of cassettes to cds and now the cloud.
No the next iPhone isn't the tenth anniversary they skipped nine
the iphone 6 came out in 2014 smh
wow i remember all that OMG and how black berry was the king and nokia i am 2 old :,c
all fun and games till you accidentally hit the buy button and you have to toss your phone across the room before it sees your face...
Should I trade my galaxy s8 plus in for this phone?
everyone has new iphones and i still have an old ipad 2
1:54 When you realize you forgot all about that built in YouTube app
And I still thought the 6 was brand new
you have a little video on your ad
The iPhone 5s was in 2013, and the iPhone 6 came out in 2014 not 2013
what about the iPhone SE?
#YIAYfetish when secxy girl show bob and open lasange for vagiene and let having big sexy sex
Hate this video, you're just a marketing outlet for Apple!
I phone is the worst phone ever madnid rather get a blackberry
Its about fucking time they added face unlock, wireless charging, and oh wait... still no headphone jack... AND NOW IT COSTS 1 THOUSAND FUCKING DOLLARS
The six came out in 2014 not 13
Lmao, I remember when I had an iPhone 4...in 2015\nNow I have a iPhone SE
soooooooooo the iPhone x is 1000 dollars as well and will still be inferior to the note 8\nthe iPhone 8,8 plus areiphone 7,7 plus with better speakers lol
You're way too enthusiastic about this company
This is advertisement and incorrect\nThanks Barnacles Nerdgasm\nSteve Jobs stole the iPhone trademarked name.
2:21 The iPhone couldn't copy and paste until the 3GS?
aaannddd, the new iphone is basically a carbon copy of the iphone 7....
It looks like a bootleg s8
rename the channel to WIRELESS
APPLE WHY THE FK IS THE IPHONE X LOOK UGLIER...wtf They gotta fire that designer...\nI'll just wait next year...
This phone is so ugly!
The True Trailer of iPhone X - THEY ARE WATCHING YOUUU -> Check it out now on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBJ-G8DocKU
Nobody was making hardware keyboards anymore or fretting about swappable batteries\n\nExtremely sadly. Everything got so mainstreamed that there were no longer options on the market for power users (nothing since Nokia Communicators). :(\n\n(Well, Jolla patched some of that up with phones being mighty hackable, having swappable batteries, multisim, addable keyboards...)
Apple shows once again they are behind the curve.
Meh don't want to sacrifice my kidney for it
in 2030 or something, phones are gonna be the old motorola touchscreen. stop making phones big.
let's kiss apple's asshole for six minutes!
So iPhone x will be bigger screen nexto iPhone x is more bigger screen like ipad
Iphone 3 always died around 36-30 battery.
Apple does NOT build their own hardware 😂😂😂
Let's just Skip the SE
we all knew this shit already
how to make an iphone\nstep 1:  take last gens design and make is slightly bigger and thinner\nstep 2:  shove last gen tech into it\nstep 3:  market it as innovative and cutting edge tech\nstep 4:  $$$$$ SUCCESS $$$$
Why do people make such a big deal about the iphone, It's just the iphone. It's the same disappointing features wack as OS.  And super high price tag Its always been.
Iphone 8 the one with a big screen\nIphone x the one with a bigger screen
4 & 8 are/will be magic, all the other in between are just ok/good :)
iphones suck dick
#yiayfetish white people slathered in pumpkin spice
Apple is trash
Shit video.
iPhone 6 was 2014
Nokia is still superior

Iphones are so overated it actually hurts
Whats the black samsung phone on 3:50 called? Its really nice 👍 someone help me out plz 🙏🏻
I hate how iPhones keep getting bigger, Why can't we have small versions too?
Samsung makes best phones, hands down
And...sponsored by Apple..
really worth it to learned...keep it up your awesome vlogs!i'll watch for sure
Keep the way of traditional DJ alive! There's too nanny performers and producers that don't dj and people mistake them for djs and I feel like that discredits the hardworking and truly talented DJ's like Laidback Luke and Afrojack.
Im soon DJ on a great collegeparty, because this is my greatest gig so far. Im wondering if you think its fine when I know most time what Im gonna play next because  want to choose songs which fit together :P
Great to be one of the guys in the 10% lol
I love this entire conversation. Don't really think I have a perspective on this, because I do understand both sides. But actually sitting down and having this conversation is fantastic.
So cool.Watched Afrojack at Ultra 2017,and also watched him on mixmag.A full set of 90*s music.U can see his work in everything.LUKEE!!!!!!
this was a great informative video
I was at ultra n the best part of that set was when he played rock the house
I personally would be pissed if my fav dj/producers played a prerecorded set. They never would so I'm good. Having a playlist with songs you want to play is ok as long as its not set in stone. If it is that tells me a dj can't read a crowd which is vital to putting on a great show.
Listen to my Avicii's friend of mine remix. Re post if u like\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/kacper-music/avicii-friend-of-mine-kacper-remix.
this total bull.....yeah okay, its mainstream and maybe a lot of the people in the club/festival want to hear certain songs BUT....back in the days, we went to the club to see the dj, NO MATTER WHAT HE WAS PLAYING....no stupid crowd-> dj suggestions, no expectations....we KNEW our fav DJ would serve us great music to dance and party no matter what.....good ol times
Love you LL. Keep doing what you do <3
I am glad you had this topic discussed with Afrojack. I will then address my comment to Afrojack. I discovered you on a Hard dance award cd, your mix of Satisfaction, I loved it and then became a fan of your first period. Then came the craziness of EDM and hearing the same sets and I got very disappointed. I went to see you at Ageha Tokyo to see your mix and I thought I was watching one of your stream in Ultra or Tomorrow and I got very disappointed. Then I understood today I might be one of your 10% fan base. I hope I can see you djing one day in a small club because may be I am getting old too and I like the surprise of djing. \nBack to Laidback Luke, thanks a lot for your videos, I am learning a lot.
guys this video is amazing. Thanks for sharing your point of view and your way to DJ.\nIt's so interesting discovering how you guys organise and prepare your sets in order to have the best for your crowd
Totally unrelated, but I'm actually wondering how or where DJs and producers get song Acapellas?
I appreciate the honesty about the festival scene. I do like that you preserve the art in the club scene.
I've been a DJ for over 20 years and I completely agree with Afrojack who by the way is also my favorite DJ, great VLOG guys!
@Laidback Luke thanks for bringing this topic up and for sharing both of your perspectives on it. It's a topic that often comes up and it was cool to see some well respected artists like yourselves shed some light on it. So looking forward to one day being able to see one of your life changing live sets <3\n\n@Afrojack  I 100% agree with what you had to say. The best sets I've seen are always the ones where the DJ can read the crowd and adjust to the situation at hand. Whether it's through crowd management on the mic or simply uplifting us through a journey of beats, that is always the difference between a good set and an unforgettable experience.  \n\nI have seen you perform at least 5 times in the past 3 years in Japan and Ibiza and not once have I ever felt like I have seen the same show twice. You continually set the bar for live sets with all the hard work and effort you put into your performances. They are always fresh with new stuff to look forward to. Your show alone is always worth traveling internationally for. Much love and respect <3\n\nLastly, no disrespect to Zedd, whom I also love dearly, but I gotta say that I was so thankful you guys brought that up. The first time I ever saw him in concert (Tokyo 2016), I had goosebumps and it was truly a mind blowing experience. The second time I went to Zoukout Singapore last year for him and it was a good show but it didn't feel as amazing as the first time. 5 months later at EDC Japan, no joke it was literally song for song the same set, same visuals, and it didn't even truly match the smaller built set. As a fan who had to pay $300 for a 2 day event (general admission), I felt disrespected and I was pissed. Still love his music and the beautiful creations he makes, but damn it was shocking to feel and eye opening to see this happen when you see what else is out there with amazing artists like you guys and Martin Garrix, and how much effort you all put into your live sets. \n\nThanks again for doing a video on this! Wishing you both all the love, happiness and success in the world. <3
Really loved the real talk. No bullshit, all real talk. Respect to both of you, since usually artists don't talk about it fearing backlash from other people. I'd really like to see more real talk vlogs like these in the future :D Cheers!
And on the other side you have David guetta who just hits play on a mix cd and can be seen with just one deck active the whole set. Put the effort in ffs.
You forgot to ask if they belong in the DJ top 100. Not prepared? 😊
I see Afrojack's point, however I am part of the 10% that love to hear a DJ freestyle, I like to hear slight mess ups... it makes the mix more human. It's like that old school sound records make, just sounds more badass. As for forgetting to play certain tracks, put them in a 'must play' playlist? Preplanned sets etc if call performing, freestyle is DJing.
100% correct. big festivals need to be prepared, especially when your on a short timeframe. But you definitely have to know how to read a crowd and play what everyone wants.
Air conditioning on in there?
Yeah iv gotta admit ...great way to explain  this topic...They are not Dj's ...they are artists
I used to put playlists together for events as an Idea base, now my crates are for music organization... When I need that next track I know where to find it. Right now 99% of my sets are on the fly
Laidback, I really love this Video. Afrojack shows the real thing in Mainstream EDM and I believe it´s in underground too. It´s hard to found Dj´s doing that for real. I know it´s good to see people jumping, we know most of the people doesn´t matter if the Dj is playing or just jumping and clap clap clap, but is a real sensation when we see someone doing that, playing for real, not push a play button. You´re very right when you said about the art, producer art is not a DJ art, but now, we see a music artists milkshake in the Big Festivals and I really miss some pitch adjusts provided by badass mixing style, but we have it in Drum N Bass and HipHop, the art is live but not in Eletronic Dance Music. I´m a Dj since 1999, and producer since 2010,  I´m an old, but I preffer the old school djs and love all the time producers.
Haven't been an Afrojack fan in years but holy crap massive respect
Afrojack is right that the kids who skip everything and go right to big festivals aren't djs, because if they ever needed to switch up on the fly they wouldn't be able to, since their sets are so preplanned and they lack the necessary dj skill. He was spot on about his views of mainstage too, and if you look in the comments of tomorrowland videos its full of people criticizing, even though they weren't actually there and are taking the set out of context.
Juicy M couldn't agree more
I really don't think people like Afrojack, Dillon, Hardwell, Skrillex, Martin Garrix, etc give a fuck about the art of DJing I think for them its all about the money really. to be completely fair play to them
Laidback luke i love you sir coz you're real😊❤️
A lot of what afrojack said is true, also it all depends on what type of DJ you are, a producing DJ can get away with having a pre planed playlist cause 99% of their playlist are gonna contain their own productions as well as their own hit productions that are guaranteed to move the crowd. That's what afrojack meant by he rarely miss-plans a set. Cause he has had many hits in the past. BUT for DJs  that do not produce and do not have there own hit songs to depend on, most of those type of djs must DJ on the fly. They don't want to play what previous djs that night may have played. So it also does depend on who you are and what type of DJ are you.
Very Very! Interesting topic to talk about, very important to identify the right kind of DJ for you. personally i prefer a live set does not matter is the constancy of a recorded set is not present.
I saw Afrojack at Omnia Nightclub in Vegas awhile back and it was one of my favourite sets yet. Could tell he was live mixing and doing a very good job of it! Gets tiring seeing Dj's who are just a stage act on the microphone constantly and spending more time dancing than mixing!
Honest and down to earth. Always a pleasure to watch. :-)
Well, i usually prepare a setlist ti play it live.... what do you think?https://youtu.be/Hx6DkylEvAs \nCheck my remix for Avicii's without you. Check it on your PC please ;)\nThanks!.
this makes me angry. this is soo lame
+AFROJACK . Please Bring An Epic Show to San Bernardino Ca @Psycho Circus: Escape!
I agree 100% with the difference between club and festival events. I worked at Omnia Las Vegas for the 1st two years it opened & as someone who gets to see each artist every time they perform at the venue, you start to realize the difference between who is a DJ & who is just a producer. For instance, Calvin Harris nights are always the busiest at the nightclub but for someone who sees him every Friday night they get bored of seeing him because his sets are exactly the same to the point where I could tell you what songs he was going to play & when he was going to play them. Then you have artists like Krewella, Chuckie, Martin Garrix, & Afrojack who either plays completely different sets (actually djing) or what I've noticed with Afrojack, to where he plays a portion of the same set then (Usually once he starts drinking out the bottle) starts to freestyle. You can hear him trying new things, not always having a flawless set. Me personally I like it when I can hear a dj messing up from time to time because that shows you they are actually Djing, trying new things, living in the moment & their thoughts in real time & not just acting & pretending to turn knobs. Another reason why DJ Mag Top 100 isn't an accurate source for the best DJ's but that's a whole different discussion for another time.
Thank you, like you say anybody could do it. I agreed. Thank you guys. Great video. Keep the DJ alive. Is fun.
Interview Is Amezing And Afrojac's Ideas and his realty is making him genuine thats the good thing
NICE! Thank you luke and nick
Being able to watch talks like this is amazing. Seeing what really goes through the heads of the people behind the turntables/laptops/mixers as a fan is awesome. I've been a huge fan of EDM my whole life and, being a dj myself, when I go watch a set, I not only have a good time, I listen to exactly what the artists are doing. I am part of the 10%. I live in Miami and I HATE festivals like Ultra Miami. Artists go out to Ultra to bust out the craziest sets they've ever performed, but I don't feel the vibe and love of a festival at all. It just feels like a huge party filled with drunk and drugged out people. Seldom are there festivals where you can feel that the crowd around you really love the music that's playing as much as you do. And it's at these festivals where the artists and the fans really have a good time and feel the PLUR vibes
Very nice blog in times when a lot of people are thinking where is a border between almost recorded set and preparing for set, between show and art😊🙏
Great interview !! Congratulations for both of You for touching interesting topic.
6:18 lmfao did the inner Borat of afrojack just come out??
these vlogs keep me rooted to the art of djing
Thank you so much for taking the time Afrojack and Laidback Luke keep posted please.
I like to play with no playlist, I like the improvisation and feel the club, when a song that you play for example, the old one, was just a pinch on your set, but the dancefloor likes it so much that at the time you includ 3 more songs, this can only be done in the heat of the moment! But, I really feel the need to think about a set for a great show, now sometimes I have a VJ together and I already see the need to think in advance about some transitions and some songs that have cool visual effects for the public to see on the big screen. Today the DJ is not only music, it is a entertainment show and in this case a planning and a DJ planned up to a certain point is essential for the operation of all the functions of a great show.
I'm not a DJ, i'm an artist and producer but I've been asked to perform and I did just that, performed. Today's DJ's are performers and there are those that are crazy talented such as: Youngr, Araab Musik, Arcane Echo, etc. those guys are all reinventing the wheel when it comes to performance. I believe DJ'ing got washed down with technology -- Most of what you learned Afro and LL respectively, has all been tucked into a simple button anyone can press BUT Your advantage is that you can read a crowd and your mental library are skills that no technology can replace. SO it's not DJing it's performing and if you want to see DJ'ing like you said go to a club or place where it's intimate.
I've been DJing on and off for half my life (17 years as none of you will know my age), and done all sorts (mostly weddings these days, but that's by the by). Max crowd of about 1000, but in the last few months I've done some last minute (a few hours notice) sets in local venues, one was 30mins notice. There are people who are better than me at reading a crowd, I don't deny that, but at a few hours or less' notice (and with a young family at home) I just have a load of playlists in iTunes to group tracks by year (and if I have some notice, categories of music I know are popular / relevant). The order isn't fixed though - I may be a fan of doing certain tracks into other tracks, but if the crowd don't take to the first track of a usual selection I'll deviate. I do a fair bit of lighting and event production work, so I can fully appreciate knowing what's coming next - mostly in the clubs (even for Ministry of Sound tour DJs), it's mostly busking. But when I see a track is coming in that I know, that I know almost inside out, and I can see on a CDJ / Serato etc display when the kick drums etc are, then I can make it a damn good freestyle lighting etc performance to add extra impact to the sound
2 realsitic people talking about the real perspective of dj and music production.
Regarding the sweaty armpits, now I realize why so many DJs wear black t-shirts on live performances and interviews. Great unexpected tip, though!
AFROVLOGS PLEASEEEEEEE!!!!!
My respect to all those Dj's the still actually mix live
Each side has their place, especially when dealing with big festivals. After all, it's about what the crowd came for, right? However, it's discouraging that the fundamental art of DJing is dying. And I think it has to do with: \n\n- EDM becoming more pop and mainstream over the years, attracting a larger audience than before. \n- Technology has made it now easier than ever for anyone to be a DJ. Thus, the advanced skill set is becoming lost. \n\nThank you guys for continuing to be an inspiration for all the die hard fans while still giving the masses what they want to hear!
So wack! Then what are you doing up there on stage? It's like paying to go watch Adele lip sync.
Sorry for the booklet but here is my opinion/story:\nFirst off mad respect to those who dj on the fly with no preparation whatsoever. It takes guts to get up on stage and read the energy of the crowd an put together your set right there. to me this means you are comfortable with all the songs you have and have been DJing long enough to know what certain song will mix well into others, what songs will easily mix into other genres etc.\n\nI just mixed for the first all school party of the year at my university a couple days ago it was huge and of course very fun. However, I primarily produce music (deep house) and I've only mixed live for an audience 4 or 5 times before. I have seen many times people put together their own mix in Ableton or Logic  and then go up and press play one time and act like the were djing. and in a sense its a little frustrating to go up on stage after those people knowing they had no risk of screwing up.\n\n With that said, I spent a good deal of time practicing my set. I took time to figure out what songs would mix the absolute best into others so my set was as clean as possible. While I guess you wouldn't consider this DJing to me it is still mixing. I was still forced to find creative ways to switch tempos, and to change keys. It was just rehearsed.\n\nwhile I am positive I would be able to get up on stage and put together a mix on the fly (I do it in my room all the time), Im not sure the set would have  the same clarity and cohesiveness that my set had, and in a way I actually feel good about all the hours I spent preparing for this set knowing that it all came together exactly as planned and sounded good. So in a way it is a modification of the art. in my opinion I will respect someone who takes the time to carefully pick how their songs will mix together. the only people I won't respect are those who put their set together in a daw and felt pressed play once
Love these guys ..but live shows are play button 100% ...it has to be for the set to go just right..its the truth but whatever
I need to know this Song at 1:11, I didn't find it on Spotify or in the comment section . Can anyone help me out? :)
Why are they both sweating so much?
Dude you've been one of my fav producers since 2011. Any way we can get more music production tutorials, tips/tricks?
Awesome job at EDC this year!! You were amazing!!
I also want to stick things on my macbook!
Great interview. What is it that Afrojack has on the back of his lap top ?  Thanks
Holy shit this was great! Thank you so much afrojack for being so real and perceptive. Still love you the most tho Luke❤️
Holy god this was so real. Im 15 and as a DJ myself, I can see where you both are coming from. All the big DJs are catering to the crowd so much that it sounds like the same set over and over. I want my kids to hear a set and say, so thats what DJing is all about. I feel that DJs nowadays get lost within the marketing and money that they forget what a DJ truly is.
great video! gave me a new way to look at the whole process!
the whole club really enjoyed your set in Albania ,Tirana ... \nno one cared about dj skills as much as everyone was there to have fun and you really made it all so much fun , and  ofc there was freestyle a lot i guess and it all sounded good tracks went well with one another if we see it from the dj skill side. The crowd was crazy , you were crazy .. hope you come back , much love from Albania !!
I think when you reach Afrojack's level, you cant risk freestyling anymore like you could in some local club.
Artists just should be in duos, where one is a sick producer and the other is a sick dj
The truth is spoken....and its appreciated!
Not sure about this. I really understand that you dont want to fuck up in front of a million crowd. However, making a mistake every now on then on stage proves that it is live what the DJ is doing their stuff on stage. The perfect live set is different to everyone. I would prefer Afrojack playing crazy shit instead of ten feet tall, because you hear the hits (don't get me wrong, I really like them) all the time. And when I'm there I want to experience a live set with music that is beyond the regular stuff.
I started djing 5 years ago and I find it a lot more fun to mix live than have a prerecorded set. You can learn from your mistakes , as they said you can play in on the crowd to see what they like , they know you're a real dj and so on.  I mean it's just way more fun to see all people going wild on a set you played live than just pressing play and acting like it's live. It gives me a much better feeling about myself.
I know that the real form of DJing is very important and that is what represents how talented a DJ is. But now, as times changed... Being like Afrojack is what I would suggest. Does anyone realize that the preparation Afrojack is talking about requires talent? People will discuss how your playlist was, How the production was. Not how well a DJ scratched and Mashed up acapellas. So I would like to say that Preparing like Afrojack is also an art. Hope you will like what I said Afrojack & Luke
Much Props to Afrojack and of course Layd Back Luke... The Problem with making live Shows or pre-recorded tracks is that sooner or later it will become a trend and club owners and concerts will just be selling you that and eliminating the middle Man wich is  you guest it.  The DJ....
why there is this common idea that the crowd wants to hear always big banger hits ?? when i am at a live event i want to feel the beat, the bass, i dont want to hear the same shit again and again because i can listen to it every fuckin day on my phone ,on my pc ecc.. i like when a dj actually mixes and does something live , i hate when he has the mic in his hands and waves his hands saying 1,2,3, jump... this summer i went to a martin garrix event and i didnt appreciate every second of it becuase it was a clearly pre-recorded set, that's the main reason why i dont like edm. if you go to a techno  event, is totally different, djs play whatever they fuckin want and i can enjoy always new sounds, new mashups and something that's is real and different.
Afrojack Mashup hahahahahaha how sad this makes me laugh and relate much... with face palm indeed
Spot on Luke and Nick!
Greatest educating video by far Luke, I was watching and listening so attentively, that I got a little bit upset that the video only lasted 13 min. way too short if you asked me haha! But on a serious note, hearing the mindset of two DJ's that basically have seen it all for me that's just fun and also inspiring, much love & respect!
great video , thanks for making this video but my personal opinion as a dj & music lover. I would rather listen too a dj mix live where it may sound a bit off at times  but i know there beat matching as opposed too sounding seamless like a robot with no beatmaching & every track sounding perfect. Just my personal opinion but big props to your videos & your music brotha
Thanks to AJ and you for keeping it real. When all else fails return to the basics The Art of DJing will reign supreme. Also If for any reason your equipment malfunctions and you need to need to do it yourself MaN Oh Man.
Chris liebing is more talented then 90% EDM DJs
I agree everything, just eliminate laptop DJing! How bow dah?
Afrojack is garbage
Waiting for a AFROLUKE MIX!
no more fake DJs!!!! LBL and AF 4life!
pause voor die dab ff
why do djs always have wet armpits.
<3
Netjes, was nuttig man thanks!
awesome video!
DJ = Disc Jockey... DISC JOCKEY
WATSKEBURTTTTT.... much love
Ben niet altijd even fan van Afrojacks muziek en houding maar hier heeft hij wel een mooi inkijkje gegeven in de industrie. Thanks Luke en Nick!
Ik ben zelf een dj en ik doe het als volgt. Stel ik speel een hele avond van bv 22u - 2u dan speel ik de muziek dat ik denk dat gaat aanslaan, bv als het nog rustig is wat tech en future house. Naar mate het volk toeneemt ga ik dan iets harder te werk, bv een black out van franky rizzardo  of een tujamo nummer. Als er veel vrouwen aanwezig zijn kan je naar r&b overschakelijk etc. en dat wissel je dan af, om je set creatief te houden. Als ik bv op een event speel waar ik 1 of 2uur draai dan zal ik mijn set voorbereiden door bv een afspeellijst te maken in recordbox en evt cue punten aan te duiden. Dit geeft dan een houvast aan wat je gaat spelen en door te weten wat je gaat spelen of toch ongeveer, kan je je extra richten op het technische.
I'll just stick to the trance scene \nNo recorded sets there \nEDM and the idiots like vegas and like mike are what's destroying the art of djin \nThe only good thing from edm is that it hopefully moves these kids on to better electronic music like techno and Trance and away from the disposable sound of electro and all the other  crap played at ultra and Tomorrow Land
Almost every song you hear a DJ play has been pre recorded in a studio anyway, so a pre recorded set is no different, it just means the DJ isn't mixing live, therefore no errors or playing songs that don't mix well, giving a much more polished performance. A few DJ's actually create music during their performance, James Zabeila and Paul Van Dyk for example, that's as close as you can get to truly organic DJ'ing. Superstar DJ's can drop The Crazy Frog into the middle of a set and the crowd will still go wild so I don't really agree with this reading a crowd nonsense, maybe unknown DJ's in clubs have to read the crowd and definitely Wedding DJ's but superstar DJ's no.
In its purest form Djing is an art. To be able to read a crowd, take them on a journey, draw tunes on the fly and seamlessly blend them takes years to master - John Digweed being a great example. At the commercial level (where Afrojack is) the art of djing is irrelevant because it's all about promoters and djs making big money by giving the masses what they want - which appears to be EDM garbage. I have no problem with people making bank, just don't proclaim to be an artist or be pushing the art of djing forward by having pre-recorded sets. I take my hat off to any dj and/or producer staying true to their craft and mastering it without selling out, because whatever they lack in earnings, their back catalogue and sets stand the test of time. Just look at Goldie (Metalheadz) and Andy C (Ram Records)  - the latter were pioneers but sold out and as a result their sets and output over recent years are a million miles away from their previous bar setting standards.
honestly bro, much respect to bam n shit... but honestly bro we on the brink of ww3 and a racial civil war , theres 3 giant hurricanes destroying southern america, plus major flooding... NOBODY GIVES A FUCK ABOUT YOU ANYMORE!
Love you Bam, glad to see you back
Fuck yes! great to have Bam back. I grew up loving him and his skating style and him in general. Welcome back Bam!
Bam be wearing the same thrasher shirt from zumies that the annoying girl in class wears every week.
Sell more of his old decks they cost more than 400 euros on ebay.... We all love Bam.\nSeriously i cry tears after this video. It's so good 2 have him back
Hey, Bam...\n\nLosing Ryan was an immense blow; it sucked ass.\nAs bad as it was for us fans, we're all aware that it was far worse for you.\n\nAnd we lost you too.\n\nBut Today, I'm just glad your're still alive, man. We're ALL so glad. Just that; Glad.\nLike; we're all cheering for you. You deserve the best. Let's have a time to remember skinny, stupid Bam and his antics, for you to be yourself.\nSome of us barely ever skated. But we all looked up to you guys. Y'all defined our youth. I can't convey the Relief that you came back to us, when you found a way to heal.\nNever stop; never stop healing. Never stop skating. Never stop remembering how good you were. You made an entire generation of young men and women better.\n\nWe channeled that angst; that silly fucking Bam energy. Keep that love strong, bro. If there's anything you need, there are hundreds of thousands of people who need you just as much. We love and support you. We need you, too, Bam.
Great to see..not an easy feat to come back from by any means..respect.
Gets a second chance at fame, no hating, hope you live well Bam.
Bam used to be the only reason I bought Element stuff! Ahhh the memories
Welcome back Bam Bam! CHEAP SKATES FOREVER! Fuck drugs and alcohol man live on that adrenaline keep pushing your looking good brother.

Glad he's happy again
Looks like Bam is doing a lot better in 2017.  Nice.
It's not the quantity of friends, it's the quality of friends. Ride on.

Killing it just as hard man!!!
Bam's gonna make a crazy comeback for a guy his age. Watch his feet. Motherfucker still has his most of footwork in there somewhere, he'll get it.
This foo went to re hab lol not Europe .
That's what's up!! I remember I use to want a element bam board when I was in middle school!! I'm 22 now time flies ..🛩️
Not many make it back out of the fire... good to hear it!
we all do things to escape the pain and skateboarding helps numb the pain just as well as other things it's been 3 years since i have actually skated like i use to this is even more motivation for me now. Thanks Bam
Go watch epically latered on Vice, theres an episode on Bam its really good!

You can do it, Bam! I'm not a skater, not a huge fan of your shows, but I can tell you're a good dude. With some work and a little elbow grease you'll be back and in full effect. We're rootin' for ya!
Wow grew up with this guy motivating me to skate..stay strong my man

Checkout QuantheMulatto and his new viral music video Single Entitled
BAM IS THE MAN.    YOUR FAN FROM BROOKLYN
Good to see you again Bam. Be strong always
If you guys like this you should check out Epic Later'd Bam Margera its about an hour long but basically goes really in depth with him, his wife, family and friends about his recovery and getting back to where he is now. Its really sad.
f*cin f*ck yeah! F*ck yeah for bam! dominator of underground concrete parks and the sal spin , originator of the ssbsts and one b.a.m.f'n all out firebursting skater ain't no sinking in to the underground with this original pro, congrats!!!
Great to see him comeback wheter hes killing it or just skating still
So glad he found something he enjoys again. Was afraid after Dunn he was going downhill but he looks better than ever and always been one of my favourite skaters
awesome to see that hes back. fuck everyone else
I am both very happy and relieved to see Bam again! Hope he is doing well and is feeling alright
Over the past 12 years, whenever someone mentions skateboarding, I always 110% automatically think of Bam. To me, growing up, Bam was the face of skateboarding. He was what I associated skating with. Seeing Bam back at it again now, it just brings back nostalgia!! Who still has/wears Bam's clothing?? The Bam logo at the end of this video is the hoodie I have with pink font and logo!!
good to see he isnt so depressed anymore. gotta enjoy life while u can
Love seeing bam getting back on his game! Fuck ya bam!
Don't repeat history bam, make history haha you can do it man!
I just found my CKY2K on VHS... who has a VHS? haha
Who else feels like grabbing their old skate board and trying to skate again? I know i do!!
That's fucking awesome. Go skate and have fun dude. That's what its all about!
Main reason why I bought an Element board (that I still have) was because of Bam. Glad you guys are back.
so strange, was thinking about Bam and CKY earlier today, wondering what he's doing now. Then I go on Youtube and this is in my suggested videos. Good to know he back on a board!
Awesome he is back! VivaLaBam was what got me into sk8n.
How's it feel to be the Fat Bastard now bam to be honest with you it just looks like Phil picked up skateboard and learn how to skate you fat ass
Fuck yeah, so stoked Element is pushing for his return to skating,
I said Bam would be dead a long time ago. I'm glad to see he is still kickin. I'm a recovering heroin addict. I have the faith to believe you can stay sober Bam. I worry that you might feel too much pressure to stay clean, and not want it for yourself. If you fuck up it's ok. Don't let the pressure of other people's expectations ever fuck up your recovery!
Who is this old man?
Bam Im very proud of you!!
Not gonna lie. He's hot as fuck.
Good to see you smiling again Bam. We love ya brother. Keep up the good work man. Love from Detroit.
Great to see you back Bam
Fucking hell! WB Bam, and a seriously sterling effort to get your shit together too mate 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

Oh Trevor, poor thing! 😓😁 I really like him, he is so funny! But it's true, honestly here in Barcelona he's not known at all... 😂 If I had been there, I would have asked for a pic with both of them! 😊😊😊 On the bright side, he can be just a tourist around here. 😅

Necesito un Carpool Karaoke de Shakira con James Corden. :'v
Trevor Noah is annoying
Trevor Noah... eww 👎👎👎
Shakira is awesome, trevor noah sucks balls
IDEA:\nIt can be really coooooooool if in every token in every real booster will have a code to enter in the online game to get the cards you opened in the booster :O
Across format play please! It's why this will beat out MTGO. Help the DCI tie in with the game so that we can win planeswalker points with the mtg games! I'll let you guys know when I play the closed beta, and I'll pass it along to my follower!
I just want an online mtg game that lets me play commander with all cards available for commander that is well supported. I'd even be ok with something like legacy, or last resort modern.
Q. Why did you choose to build MTG Arena instead of a new Magic Online client?\n\nA. There were a lot of advantages to starting fresh with MTG Arena. The team is building the game in Unity, which gives us more flexibility for future growth. We created a new Game Rules Engine that can better understand even the most obscure card interactions. We wanted to integrate modern online services that will create a dynamic overall experience and also someday integrate with other aspects of your Magic life.\n\n\nI know wizards is a business, but this is just pure greed. They might as well not candy coat it and just say the real answer..... $$$$$
The voices are wayyy to low..
This will be a success, if we can buy single cards, if we can play without paying for every match and if they include old cards/formats.
Why the fuck would they choose a fucking hearthstone player and a thot to play this?  Give us some real players not this fan service
Hmmm, looks good 1v1, but what about the other formats 4 player or more? lets hope it gets everything set up for that as well :)
If they update magic duels I would glad give my money for it but seeing how they proceed with their business I would not give a penny for magic ever again, me nor my close friends. Keep in mind that important detail, uncertainty over a company and its products always leads to a downfall. Like if you Agree.
Well this is nothing short of hideous. Don't get me wrong, I'll try any magic product, but digitalised mtg cards look fugly. Should've just looked like collapsible HD scans. If they were trying to be modern they should've gone and make a completely new look for them, but the modo vibe is just painful to look at.
WotC, pleeeease offer code-cards in future booster packs. Please!\n\nI would like to play both, paper Magic, AND Magic: Arena, not just one :*(\n\nPLEASE!
This being only in standard is.... disappointing.
That balance without a sleeve.\nI'M CRYING
What happens for people who took time in Magic Duels. I mean, I almost unlock everything in this game. Will I have to start over everything ? Or getting bonuses ?
This looks so shitty. Is this really what they are doing in 2017? The whole thing still looks like it's from the 90's
the need to make the text more easily readable. I'm pretty excited though for a way overdue mtg game that wotc actually puts forth effort into.
Oh look, the Smash 4 to Duels' Brawl. Neat.
I could be wrong, but I don't think most players care about these useless visuals and sound effects. We just want a more intuitive and functional version of MTGO. And you can improve aesthetics without making this into a hearthstone clone. Keep things simple and elegant.
I feel that if Wizards doesn't have the resources to address the existing bugs in MTGO, I can't imagine dividing them and also adding in fancy visual effects will make development any faster. I honestly enjoy MTGO and I could recommend it more if there weren't so many bugs and slow downs. I hope this full rules engine or whatever delivers and makes it easier on their end as well.
It looks realyl amazing for Beta, can`t wait to get my hands on this. I used to play Magic mostly in the Theros-Tarkir expansions, but then it was becoming a bit too much for me, if this works as I am imafining, this will be my MTG comeback.
Already spent on magic duels why would I pay for cards on the new game ?
I think legendary creatures are also going to need voice lines in addition to planeswalkers. I'm not the biggest fan of edh but imagine dropping your commander and hearing a voiceline from the flavortext like leovold's I'm sure we can come to an agreement.\n\nI also hope there's an option to take away the flashy animations for the players who are playing for competetive practice.
The way he dodged the question on how to get new cards in the game gave me a bad wipe ^^
Also it would be nice if the lands looked a little more different than the other cards, the borders are almost exact to the colored spells.
Am I the only one who wants Shandalar 2?
WHY IS the WORLD PREMIER held in a BASEMENT? FAIL!
Looks really bland so far, that raging sowrdtooth effect needed more UNF for how powerful it is. Look at the animation of Mad Bomber in hearthstone.
Girl Magic Player that is Attractive??!
Remake the 1997 Shandalaar game. Please don't just copy the Hearthstone model.
I cannot wait for the full release. This looks really cool and MTG needed a good online engine.
Oh goody cant wait till this gets abandoned like everyone over magic the gathering online game
looks cooll <3
Anyone who plays magic knows wotc is only interested in making profits no matter how much they deny it. Each step they've taken in the last 4+ years prove it. To remaking same cards with new names just so they make cash to switching to substandard card print machines that create misprint so frequently it's affecting every 3rd or 4th box. They'll monetize this game no doubt. It's definitely will not be just f2p, they'll get money from you one way or another. Be warned.
I love magic so much.... crazy how much it has evolved since 1993.........
They need to reinforce the idea that this is the new and ever improving and expanding digital format for Magic... They have A LOT of cards to go through I would like to see most sets in this game and EDH support. The pricing model needs to be cheap too especially for older stuff. I have spent thousands on cards already.
SO its like magic online with cool animations? Is it limited to standard and limited format?
Where the fuck is the FLAVOR TEXT
They need to make tapping rotate the cards by 90°. Its gets confusing, especially when u look at ur opponents board. Right now u might miss untapped cards u would normally notice. If not 90° at least make it clearly visible, 45° at least.
I love the idea of banking time during short turns for later on when you need more time for a turn. That seems like a great solution.
Oh sweet, Jimmy Wong plays MTG!
Introducting MTG Arena: Hearthstone ripoff 'cause we we're slow and don't know how to innovate!
I think it looks great. I thought Duels was clunky and way too slow, but I'm a bit intimidated by MTGO. This looks like a nice, snappy way to play MTG.
We need a new MtG Battlegrounds game
I can't help to wonder if this product will be left to die in 2-3 years like all previous digital efforts they've made (excluding mtgo)
Magic is better than Hearthstone. Magic can't be Hearthstone. Stop.
Love the idea but gawd it looks ugly when compared to the previous MGT games.
Magic the gathering doesn't need sound efects and flashy animations.
These sound effects are terrible. The animations are ten times worse. The cards not tapping is a disaster, it's way easier to absorb the board state by seeing a fully tapped card than it is to check for the tap symbol on each card. The text being completely hidden on each card doesn't actually make for a more streamlined experience, it actually makes it more confusing and time consuming when you need to go hover over several cards when you need to make a decision in game. Playing with square pictures is not more appealing than playing with something that actually looks like a Magic card.
Who's leg do I have to hump to get commander into MTG arena
Magic Arena looks to much like heartstone, magic is  mature content game giving a childish look takes me out of the game ... Magic duels look better TBH
GIVE ME A SLICE OF THAT HEARTHSTONE MONEY FOR FUCK SAKE!
Why dont you just make MTGO good? New client, new look etc. MTGO could be superior to Hearthstone, but this Game looks like a shitty clone.
I love it  (lit a bit late MTG) :)
looks great. dont listen to the haters. but please make tapping 90 degrees
@Jimmy Wong please tell me Arena will support Commander.
Online magic???? Man i gotta get this
ALL AS STANDARD CARDS , it was everything I wanted since the duels
This looks like the other BS Magic games they put out for the Xbox..Why don't they make at MTGO look good!!!
I did it for the chicks.
Is Gaby still afraid of trump?
JIMMY NOOO! Say on the light side, stay with commander
she is so incredibly irritating and the game looks horrible.
That's so many sound effects. Hope there is a mute option.
I'm a Hearthstone player at heart, decided to look up Magic. I was like: Is that Amaz??
The angled view is worse than a top down view.  If your goal is to make assessing the game state easy, top-down is superior.  Magic Online, Hearthstone, and all the major digital card games do top-down views, because they are superior.
after what you guys did with duels, I ain't playin nor wasting a dime on your future games.
Finaly, should have done a MTG game like this years ago. Now i can stop playing RNGstone and have some quality games.
Happy for this :) Glad they have a new engine to look to the future. I'll be waiting for the PS4 release..
What are those colored squares changing appearance all the time? Are they... cards? These visuals really suck, I prefer they kept Duels.
Please let us customize how much HS flashiness we need to endure while playing, also a Pandora plugin for actual music, or something similar anyway. Looks kinda neat, but I wouldn't spend $$ on it.
i would like this is a joke or a fake....
If I may make one request, give one piece of feedback in an attempt to move WotC away from a direction I fear they may be taking here, it's this: please, do not try to compete with Hearthstone or other born-digital card games in terms of the things they can do in a digital format. That is, leverage what makes Magic different from those games: the depth of gameplay due to extremely limited variance. You guys learned a long time ago that randomness is inversely correlated to strategy level. That's why coin-flip effects are so rare now and library manipulation so valuable. Digital card games use randomness as an inherent part of their mechanics and gameplay, and that is not where Magic should go. I understand that paper Magic is not going away, but my fear is that WotC will use the crutch of a digital format as an excuse (or maybe just a subconscious justification) for reintroducing more variance into the game, knowing that they will be able to translate those mechanics into a digital format. This is the exact opposite of what needs to be done. Digital versions of MtG must be vessels by which to convey the core gameplay to wider audiences, and the focus must still be completely on developing compelling mechanics that work in paper and have low variance. I hate to be so reserved when so little of Magic Arena is known, but screw the voice acting, tap visualization, sound effects, graphics, etc.: this is my primary fear.
I don't play Hearthstone especially because I don't like the flary and eye-sore animations. You shut off Duels to copy that? Sorry, but I want to play a game where I can think about my turns without being distracted by too much agitation on the screen.\nAlso, I'd rather you kept the original size of cards with the text, instead of squaring or rounding them.
Looks like shit. Magic Duels had a shitty engine but at least it didn't look like it was made for 5 years olds. Is it too hard to make a decent, modern, real MTG game ? We don't want a bad Hearstone copy. Get your shit together.
you can play a card without having the mana for it and then unplay it. I thought they dropped that rule after people used it to abuse Lion's Eye Diamond back in the days?
Any one know what sets are going to be available at launch to build your decks from?
Best thing they could do with this is add every pre-construct EDH deck, and add the commander format
i would love to see archenemy
So is this the replacement for MODO? I hope so. I'm not a huge fan of the textless cards cuz I feel like I can't parse the game state especially if I don't know the cards (like when a new set is out :p)\n\nBut Ixalan is looking amazing. Pirates versus Dinosaurs people!
Oh how much I had loved to see this being like Magic Duels but fixed and updated with all the Vintage Sets and formats to play. But no...you had to make it a Hearthston copy... :(
Gaby is a Fox.)
Ugh, it sounds like an awful kung fu movie. I can't wait to mute this game
Take my money!
poop card
00:56 That Chandra Cosplay is just SICK!!!
COPY OF HEARTHSTONE. HEARTHSTONE WANNABE LUL
hype train
Love it
Amaz, arena specialist
can't stand Amaz...
This stream needed some Ben Brode Kappa
HA! Gaaaaayyyyyyy!!
This is amazing!
Goodbye RNGSTONES,,, miss the MTG..
Nintendo Switch release pls haha
where to download
ADD COMMANDER!!!
To the people who criticize the 10 degree tap. Back in 1994 we all used to tap like that. The time before vintage had a name. When there was no legacy, extended, modern, commander, pauper or standard... Just Magic.. To me, Arena feels very authentic and in the spirit of the game. I understand new players don't experience this nostalgia, but keep it civil everyone. Provide constructive feedback to the game via the Beta. Trolling doesn't improve the game we all love.
Hahaha! A complete and total visual ripoff of Hearthstone. Real creative WotC. I suppose it was only a matter of time. \n\nIs it just me or do some of these sound effects also sound right from HS?
The thing i don't like and i don't know if im just not seeing an enchantment or artifact on the battlefield but at 16:03 Amaz plays his second Card that he did not have mana for, a seven drop when he has 6 mana? and back at 10:31 he drops a 4 drop dinosaur for 3 mana can someone explain?
I love how bubbly  you are! 😍
Louise, I just read your tweet, and although I didn't comment when I first watched this video, I honestly spent the whole time thinking 'wow if I can look this good when I'm pregnant I'll be VERY happy'. \nPeople are pathetic and jealous, just pity them. Because that's what those comments are. Pitiful. \n\nIk it's really hard but PLEEAASE. You're  ALL kinds of goals, beautiful lady! 😍💖
Louise is literally the best mother ever, and this comes from someone with a parent who suffers from alcohol abuse, so watching Louise honestly gives me so much hope I can be like her one day ❤️❤️
F*ck the haters, you're an amazing mum and a beautiful woman! You keep doing you because you're doing incredible! 💛
Louise tweeted that she is struggling with the amount of hate she's received on this video. So can we have a comment thread on the things we love about Louise please?!!
Just catching up with your vlogs... bit behind, forgive me. \nI so look forward to your vlogs everyweek. Please don't let the bastards get you down.\nRemember there is more of us that love you!!! Keep being you  xxxxxxx
This video has been in my watchlist but hadn't been able to watch it yet . However I saw your Twitter and it made me sad that people were sending hateful messages. You keep doing what you're doing Louise , fuck the people who want to spread the hate . We love you ❤️❤️
Just came from your twitter and it made me so sad! So I thought even though this might get lost in the sea of comments I would try to add one more number to the positive comments and say that you are a beautiful woman! In fact in the past few vlogs you've uploaded I have actually thought, Wow Louise's hair has been on point lately. The way it's curled and styled reminds me of those old glamorous hollywood actress. Very classy!  Also that is the cutest yellow raincoat, the color looks great on you. Hope your day gets better :)
Gosh I hope I'm half as good at being a mum and a successful career woman in a few years as Louise is now! A bloody fantastic inspirational lady!
Seemed like such a lovely day 💗💐\nthank you for sharing that louise 😇
Aww lovely video :)) And how snazzy are those trains?!?!
vlogging with big bump, small child and bag- you super woman!!
Your vlogs and happiness bring me so much cheer!
I flipping love Louise, so beautiful and genuine and such an amazing mum. don't let anyone get you down- you're great!
Louise you are absolutely stunning and your figure is gorgeous don't listen to anyone that says otherwise ❤️ I wish I had your confidence 💕
Just looking on Twitter and saw Louise's tweet about the inappropriate and negative comments on this video about her being a single mum. I think it's sick how disrespectful some people can be and I know I respect Louise massively about what she does. My mum is a single mum and I have seen sometimes how hard it can be for her so for people to be so negative to Louise I think is terrible... Ok rant over😌
Im not usually one to comment on videos and I havent had a chance to watch this video yet, saving it for later but i saw your tweets and i just want to say how amazing and inspiring you are, i love love love watching your videos they always cheer me up you are HILARIOUS. Anyone who feels the need to comment negatively on anything is not anyone that you need in your life anyway. Keep doing what ur doing. Love you lots.
Hey Louise, I know you probably wont see this comment, however, amidst all the hate and stupid comments you are getting, I would just like to say how well you are doing and what an inspiration you are. It isin't often that people you don't know are able to send positivity into your life without evening realising. Thank you! Thank you for not giving up on all the people who support you.
Awesome video . . . . u can go to  http://www.ytboost.info/  to boost your views. Best portal for views.
Looks like you had an amazing day out xxx
LOSE WEIGHT
You look amazing in this vlog ! I mean you always look amazing but I find you very glowing in this video !! Xx\n\n\n\n (I'm not sure if it's correct because I'm not English 😁)
I think it is nice to see that your bump is growing at that it gets heavier to do normal day activites, it means that the baby is growing and healthy! Don't listen to the haters (although it is hard, I know it is!) everyone is different and goes through pregnancy different, and they probably don't even know what it is like to have a child in their womb! No matter if they do or not, they have no right to complain anyway!
Love Louise so much. I hope I'm half the mum she is one day 💕
This video made me so happy :)
This is so lovely & cute <3
Looks like you had a lovely day Louise! Your happiness makes me happy❤️
Killing Louise love you ignore these haters who are clearly insecure whorebags themselves
Rushden lakes- I drive past there everyday for work as I commute from Cambridge to Wellingborough. I went to M and S football after work and was impressed! Yet to go to all the other shops - looks great though!

Louise you are absolutely glowing right now! I was just a big sweaty mess at this point in my pregnancy 😂!

The iPhone of houses and the video is presented by Samsung.... Did I smell something fishy in here..!! 😝😝
there's a suicide mood Setting?
Yeah, solving housing issues for the already super rich! I will say that I would love to own  house like that on a high level, with a nice view.
The most advanced truck container ever YES
What happens if like a computer goes out, the processor or one of these technologies go out? Surely you can't replace it considering these technologies are modified to work with each other.
Privacy over Luxury. I'd pick Privacy.
If I'm still having to do these things in an app why not just turn on the TV or light myself?
This 'smart' home glorified shipping container = $140000\nMy 6 bedroom townhouse w/ garage = $210000\n\nHmmm, think this might be a little overpriced, guys. Is the American housing market so bad that this is competitive?
How much does it cost though?
Or you can buy a trailer home with double the space for a quarter of the price
The iphone of houses, presented by samsung
All talking and not showing.
Me: Thanks for coming, now GTFO my house. 😂😂
anyone knows the music track at 1:24 ?
Whoa, cool!
its called iPhone house because living in there is like doing working on ur iphone
This guy is clueless... Trying to solve the housing crisis for all... Bruh, your'e building a house for midget inspector gadgets... not a logical, affordable, transportable space for those in need. I guarantee this tiny oddity costs about as much as an average ranch in the suburbs.
Like the house but not all the tech that's included, I wonder how much it would be without the tech ?
I really hope that these are the houses of the future 😂
ill build it myself, im a programmer
Iphone of the houses presented by Samsung 😂
Houses like iphones? so is it overcostly with  less features, less capabilities and less practicality?...
this should be the Dorm of the future
Casita in Spanish means little house
I prefer a earth ship home but how much are these?
hackers will love that house 😅
You forgot to mention that the house is meant for bunnies
House concept = awesome. Hipster glasses cocky guy = unnecessary. Man go jrk with a mirror to yourself, you talk like humanity's saviour or smth. ._.
Can they produce one with a Google home instead of an Alexa?
see how the founder struggling to explain who are their target market, he is not even sure what his target customers are.
I could have used a few more buzz words in there
HATE these commercialised tiny houses! They negate the point of a tiny house, which is affordability and simplicity. You could almost buy a brick and mortar house for the cost of this! I hate how some companies have taken this idea and made it like a regular house, which is,  unaffordable!
What's your plan on the structural and mechanical services side to stacking these individual houses? Not so simple with all the housing codes
That hat is just stupid. You're old, man. Accept it.
Yo does anyone know where in Austin one of these kasitas are located?
The comparison with iPhone make it so last gen
What happens to their kids? There's barely space for 3 to live
This is ridiculously, horrendously expensive. The realistic price of a unit like this should be around 10k usd.
Wow this looks like them house from the ready player one trailer where the future looked really bleak
Cover more of the screen with black boxes. I love not being able to see anything.
You will c expensive houses adopting this tech. In the future cost will go down and all house will have this smart integration. Prob faster than we think.
$139,000 for this! Yeah, really affordable. Maybe these guys could offer a non hipster edition without all the tech garbage.
Built with technology like a car or iPhone... which are outdated after 2 years
I don't know if anyone know but iphones are not affordable at all so...   wrong comparison....
Or you can buy a house 10 times its size for the same ammout.
In my opinion, this might be the coolest thing ever, and perfect for psychology! Just cram a pair of mentally depressed people and test and experiment!
Good design, but with such a high price I'd rather integrate tech to my house by myself, as well as the space efficiency
Aah, the Orwellian era is starting... it's beautiful.
I feel like a lot of people are missing the point of this. This is just the first version, yes it's expensive *now* , yes they need sponsorships *now* . So just wait, if you want this an can't afford it, let them know you want it.
This man is a genius
iphone of housing? lol how is that even a good comparison?
Just buy an RV on wheels and be done with.
Build it like a iPhone? so it works with nothing else and uses dated technology? ... sounds like a terrible idea, i guess thats why its presented by Samsung and they use Alexa because if they used those as the example of how they want to build the house then it sounds amazing
Do this in San Francisco!
would the house implode if you had a mood disorder or bipolar
All of this is a complete  gimmick. I feel bad for whoever likes this.
the background music? anyone?
I dont want a house that looks the same as all the others lmao\nIll pass and purchase my mansion with my big lot\nGood thoughts tho, but you cant make the whole world the same, not everyone has the same tastes.
Beautiful! Too bad there's no way our politicians will let this thing fly in California.
But can it adapt to my sexual desires?
This is really cool!
How much more do we have to keep advancing to the future before we lose quality of living life?
I'd rather not have a smart home since it can be easily hacked, no thank you
now, to make them wind n quake n burglar proof!?
What if everyone had a house like this so it would give more space to build other things
Endgame: agenda 2025 leave room for nature. 5 big mega cities where everyone lives in a box like this one ☝️ and everywhere else is left to nature.
So the house is hackable. Way to go.
Bruh the future is coming in lilr 7 years wow we might control something with our conscience
The iPhone of housing presented by Samsung
2:20....We have the ability to turn anything on and off.. Freaking scary because that means so won't any menial with an ipad and a little coding knowledge, or even worse, your own police, government......this is straight out of !(*$ 1984
My favorite part was the ending and what he said. lol
So how does cooking integrate with this house? Is there even a kitchen
Sounds like the name of my channel
2 things \n1.if we consider all the tech involves this house is going to be really expensive \n2.If you want to solve housing problems, then decrease the number of humans on planet Earth.
People are getting lazy to turn the light off wow wall-e era kicking in
It's the androids of houses not iPhones. IPhone's suck
You 140k? Really? Lmaooo ok 👌🏽
Powered by samsung😂😂
I would definitely want my house to get hacked
Smarter stuff - dumber folk
Cool house for one person, not so much a family; you know, those people usually looking to buy a house.
Now uh.... gtfo of my house
The ultimate bugman experience.
Kaaaseetaaaa
Hackable houses... Nice...
Huge electric bill
Profanity!!!!!!!!

Very interesting and luxurious recipe Jemma! Mouthwatering :D
I have been eating healthy,and for some reason watching ppl bake things this delicious and full of sugar satisfies me (???) idk like it makes me happy and helps me not eat a lot for some reason ???? Idk whats wrong with me
LOOKS GREAT
Wait what, did you say raw flour?.... Is that even a thing? 🤔
I'm eating, since I'm a child, what we call steak tartare in france, which involves raw beef and raw eggs and I'm still alive. I think it's because in the US, low quality chicken are fed with lots of chemicals, steroids and on.. I always see american people don't want to eat raw eggs, I don't get it...
Can i taste it someee pleasee

SOOO SATISFYING WATCHING THE CHOCOLATE MIX WITH THE BUTTERCREAMMM
Eggless Cookies sometime soon please. Or what can be used as a substitute of egg?
MY GIRL IS TRENDING WOO
What type of vanilla do you use?
Cookie dough has been one of my favorites for years! These cookies look amazing - I can't wait to try them! 👩🏻‍🍳🍽
Please share more cupcakes recipes:) like the snickers, choclate-guiness or rose&postachio and Banana& caramalized white choc😍
Love what you said about eating cookie dough! 😂 Can't really see how there is any more risk of bacteria in raw flour than in anything else we eat without cooking! \n\nThese look INCREDIBLE by the way! Can't wait to try making them x
Also it would be really cool if you could do a video on persian dessert, there are two that are very popular and taste SOO GOOD. one is called sholehzard- like a rice pudding dish with saffron and the other is called Ferini also like a rice pudding but with rice flower and rose water! not many videos on how to make them and they taste amazing, Hope you could one day maybe do one! Or just try making it for yourself i feel like you'd love it.
So she measures the in metric and standard measurements?
Hi @CupcakeJemma, do you have a recipe for crispy thin crunchy cookies?
Or OR just hear me out you see how fast you can eat the extra cookie dough
Jemma these look fantastic!!! I'm from Texas and love your videos!!! If you have extra and would like..you can always mail us some!!!
Hi Jemma, I love your recipes and videos! A while ago, I bought your Beginner's Cupcake Making Course on SkillMilk, which I should have had access to for the rest of my life. But its been quite a long time that the SkillMilk website has been down and I can't find any way to contact them. Please help me out! Thanks xx
Can you make cake pops please
How long can you freeze the dough? \nLove you videos
I'm just gonna do the raw eggs recipe for the cookie dough in the inside. A young boy dies from eating to much raw eggs.
Um I have never heard of being afraid of eat raw flour
can i also have your recipe in making a 9 inch moist chocolate cake please.. i just want to bake a cake for my sister's birthday..
Do you have to use dark chocolate?
When are you in C and D  cause i would love meeting you on wednesday in crumbs and doiles😍😍
You can microwave flour as well. Just ask until it reaches 160F.
I'll do this recipe but instead of that buttercream, I'm going to use dulce de leche. #ArgentineanStyle
Wow I am used to the eternal eating raw egg is dangerous debate but  eating raw flour is dangerous is a new thing for sure
Your recipes are amazing, please could you do more conventional easier cakes/cupcakes or tray bakes?? i love baking, thank you so much!
Eating raw flour/eggs is no longer a wide spread problem because of more intelligent manufacturing processes these days. The risk with eggs especially is none existent anymore
seeing this only made me feel that I gained 10 kilos!
Um... How much is that in freedom units?
Hi! How do you keep your cookies perfectly flat? I made a lot of choco chip cookies before but every time they all came out differently
......where is that shirt from
Not watched it. But like the pic of the dog turds on biscuits😂
@CupcakeJemma how long will the chocolate cream cheese buttercream last at room temperature? (shelf life)
Please make cakes based on Indian theme,green tea & red wine please
These look lovely! :) How do you chop your chocolate chips so neatly? I always get lots of flakes of chocolate with a few chunks instead of nice chips!
Have only started hearing about people being worried to eat raw flour in the past month or so. Strange, but each to their own for good reason
Oh come on it's 2:30 in the morning and now I want these
Please do a makeup tutorial ♥️♥️
How about you make something with two amazing things in it caramel and cookie dough thank you for your videos you inspire thousands of people
Yo it's my first time watching her and damn she looking good 👀😩 she some eye candy
I don't like cookie dough.\n\nI LOVE it.
I too ate cookie dough. With 7 children, my mom had to guard the fridge when making cookies 😊 Love this recipe
They are similar to Argentinian alfajores
what type of vanilla do you use? i live in Canada and i just use a cheapy brand and its liquid but your appears to be thick. im very curious!!
What can i use instead of demerara sugar?
I ate raw cookie dough all the time and I'm still alive too!   I'd rather eat it raw than baked anyway!   Love this recipe.
Every time u said thin saugage I thought of my ex boyfriend hehehe lmao 😇😅
this is really first time i hear that eating raw flour would be bad.. :D
Well I know what I will be doing tomorrow. 🤗
No offense but this is food porn to the max😍
Were sandwich cookies on bake off the same week as this video lel
hi jemma i am 14 and when i was in london me and my cousin made your rainbow cake thank you.
jemma can we use homemade cream cheese please tell me that the result will good or not
I love this already
Love the recipe! Maybe as an added extra you could put cookie butter instead of frosting if you want extra cookie flavor :D
Cookies can never be too much for me😅
You are AMAZING!!! Love your recipes 💓
That's a gilded lily double dipped in chocolate.
I'm trying this asap!
Has she ever made banana bread?
What's this grams nonsense. Use cups.
I might have missed something, but why did she make more cookie dough? Was there a reason why the extra cookie dough made in the beginning couldn't be used to sandwich the cookies?
Can you do a video on how to start your own bakery? I am a dessert lover and bake on my free time and EVERYONE is always telling me to start my own bakery but I'm so lost with where to even begin! Lol Your such an inspiration to me when it comes to that and I watched all your videos!! Much love😁😁💛💛
Hello jemma please i need your help 😊\n Tell me how to make a perfect sugar paste
hello jemma. 😊 love all your recipes. 😍 hoping you could make a video on how you make your version of red velvet cookie sandwich with cream cheese filling.. or redvelvet crinkles with cream cheese filling. thank you
*Tell me how this is on trending with 40k views*
After you freeze the cookie dough, how long do you cook it for.... is it the same amount of time as freshly made?!?! Xxx
Cookie dough is not food.
Melon baller for the cookie balls? 🤔
Why does she roll the cookie dough into a sausage? Does it make a difference in the fridge?
so i found this new recipe, it's just cookies with cookie dough in it.\n\n\n\n\n\nVictim found dead\nCause of death-salmonella poisoning \nSeptember 7th, 2017

Can't believe it's happening \n#UniteTheLeague
funny how everyone thought this was godsmacks cover when the trailer first dropped.
Not available in the U.S? :(
I still think they should have taken Godsmack's version!! More aggresive!! More intense!!
Kinda has a NiN Closer vibe.i like it
It's about to go down JUSTICE LEAGUE FOR LIFE!!!
Play this shit on 1.25x it's fucking awesome
So hyped about the movie
Not really a fan:(
we're the justice leauge,we don't quit we win...
Is this the full version? The one in the trailer has a part where he says right now twice, consecutively. It also has that kind of humming guitar sound at the end but for longer and louder rather than only playing in the background and fading out in the end at 2:51\nThe one in the trailer gets really loud and ends with a bang. Any version with that?
Micheal jakson was the first owner of this song...
This film better hit me in the feels like a kryptonite bullet in the heart.
They botched up the chorus. It doesn't feel like a strong enough Come Together at all for a song this hype. I tried listening properly but it still feels way too weak compared to the rest of the song.
Holy shit this is fire
Man I hope this film is gonna be all the hype they make it look and sound.
tell me....\ndo you love it???\n\nYOU WILL!!!!!
this aint the one from the trailer .,.... that ones way better
Please, please, let this movie put the DCEU on the same level as the MCU!
You can't save the world alone.
is this the official ost?
Like general zod said release the hype engine
How many likes does this video have. Not enough.
Mmmm naaah.... Couldn´t even finish it. Godsmack version is waay better. This one totally bored me
considering all the reshoots, and Whedon....I have hope. I'm not a guy who thinks Whedon can do no wrong, but I DO feel better knowing he's involved .
Still think it was a mistake to get rid of Junkie XL and use Danny Elfman
Got to be a Joker, He just do what he please.     \n\nCoincidence?  I THINK NOT!!
The hype is real guys!!! All aboard of DC TRAIN!!  We will make history!! 😎🙌🙆🙌🙆🙌🙆🙌🙆💪💪👏👏👐
Please give me new superman theme's link...
Zack knows the perfect song!
C O M E T O G E T H E R
The Beatles will forever be relevant.
Put this shit on ITunes already and make it available in the U.S. bish
I'm an Artic Monkeys fan, but I dig this version far better theirs
What are your powers again?\n\nI'm RICH 😎😎😎
Completely ready for Justice League ⏰
Long live DC
League Awakens
aeroamith was good
Well they sure took their time to release it. The trailer came out 4 months ago
JL 💗
FINALLY THE OFFICIAL ONE! Well shorta.
Let's hope it's not too late.
Even if there's any civilisation left  after Andromeda collides with our milkyway !!!\nam sure they'll listens MJ's #Come_together!!!! THE BEST!
Listen it on 1.25x or 1.5 speed \nIt sounds lit
My turn looking forward to see that Batman tank scene
Cum together!!! awhhh   right noww
I love your username. Most people probably don't get it.
How awesome would it be, if this was the end credit song! #HypeNation 🙌🙌
just like the trailer,,, I DIG IT!!!!!
I was so sad when Warner Bros cancel the justice league mortal in 2008 what a stupid act
Please, please, please let this be playing when they suit up for the 1st time together and walk out and let it be in slow motion. That would be cheesy as all hell but 100% of me would not give a fuck cause it would be badass
The only part I hate is 3:13
The worst part of the song is 3:14
Barry - What were your super powers again ?\n\nBruce - ... I'm rich
First Icky Thump, now Come Together ? The Justice League is Badass !!!
They should play this in the opening credits like in watchmen or those Old Clint Eastwood cowboy films like the good , bad, and the ugly.
it is fucking killing music
So is Danny Elfman still doing the Justice League score? I was hoping junkie XL would be collaborating with Elfman to create a JL score.
I'd let Gary Sir made me deaf, love this song 😍
YES!!! I FEEL LIKE A CHILD A CHRISTMAS MORNING!!!!! LET'S DO THIS PEEPS!!!!!!!!!
IVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR THIS
1:25\nWho else said My Turn?
Why 14 dislikes?  The video does exactly what it says on the tin!  Fair enough if you don't like the song, but dont dislike the video, he's just done his job!
2:33-3:14 I get chills with this part
Music by Danny Elfman or Junkie XL ?? 🤔🤔🙃🙃
Badass level +99999999999999999

This is AWESOME.
Ladies and gentlemen, you may have to adjust the color of your monitors...it is definitely a yellow strap! Haha...I didn't realize it would be so controversial. Pull up the Wiki shot of it and it's pretty obvious.\n(You can also judge based on the brown underpieces that Link wears as a part of that outfit as well, plus the little laces in front at his neck...the hat to me was the most obvious, though)\n\nAlso, just to clarify: A lot of people are saying It's obvious it's Fallen Hero because Link wakes up in a Reincarnation Chamber. Technically, you can't use that as evidence here because the Hero is Defeated division is specifically related to Link losing at the end of Ocarina of Time against Ganon, NOT the battles described in BOTW.\n\nLastly, a lot of people are mentioning the appearance of the Mirror of Twilight in the form of the Fragmented Monument. And that's a really good point, however, if you look at the Fragmented Monument in BOTW, its design is pretty strongly different from the Mirror, in particular the writing in an ancient language around the rim of the circle. \n\nCould the timelines have united and this is at the end of them? That's actually what I was hoping for as I researched! Sadly, I just didn't feel like there was enough evidence to support that. When I stopped to look at all the evidence together as well as how Eiji Aonuma was talking about this game leading up to its launch, it felt like the team INTENDED this to be a return to that first timeline while making nods to the other games.
OT has only fresh water Zoras, and since Hyrule is underwater they don't want it to be discovered by Zoras like the sea salt ones in MM. That's why WW has only Rito.
What if BOTW is in a timeline where they all start to fuse again?
have you ever tought that the last game could be the continuation of all of them, where somehow the 3 alternate timelines somehow disappeared and the original timeline came back? Idk
I think it would be neat if Breath of the Wild was meant to connect all of the timelines at their ends, it happens so long after all of them and has SOME proof for each one, it wouldn't surprise me if it was meant to be a way to end the three timelines, with every game in the future happening after Botw so we don't have to theorize about which one it falls into anymore
Was anyone else super satisfied that the video was 15:00
Yeah tell me where DOES the Legend of Zelda... XD CD-I games fit in... XD
I love this stuff
Hey MatPat, I just wanted to send a message suggesting a game called La Mulana. It has a great plot based on ancient historical information and I think it'd be a really cool way to tie a lot of games together in an awesome theory. For example: Michael Jackson makes an appearance scrawled on a wall in the ancient ruins of La Mulana meaning that he is among the earlier children birthed by the mother and a separate race from our own. This connection to the real world also adds a cool background to the every game is in every universe theory by making every thing birthed by the Mother or maybe even related to her. Anyway yeah, I think it could make a cool theory and would also be a game you'd enjoy.
but MatPat what about the side quest where you have to find the missing pieces of the twilight portal, the bridge where Farosh flies near is the same bridge from Twilight not only that but also why does Zelda know about the Twilight realm. plus you watch Link's coronation in German. with all these evidence it proves that your theory would be wrong and the only real explanation would be a time convergence of some sorts. The creator hints that the game might be in a timeline of it's own or it's CONNECTED to all of the other timelines.
I would love to see a star craft 2 theorie about how much time a real minute is in star craft world for example a marine takes 30 secs to build and a battlcruiser 180 so how much dies it really take in the battlefield (sorry for bad english)
Sssshhhhh the CD-I Zeldas do not exist ssshhhhh. xD
Google John Titor: Its cools
Hah! That Steins;gate joke.
February is spelled wrong ...3:09
rise and shine Mr. Freeman
Hate to break it to you guys but its already been announced zelda BotW takes place after twilight princess and four swords adventures and is indeed part of the child hero of time timeline. Its literally canon yall can look it up
There isn't any concrete proof that this theory is true. I mean sure, there are a lot of subtle hints to patterns, but other than that? There's a lot more proof for it being in the child time line.  The mirror of twilight can be found in the game and even put together. And the line zelda says is still solid post-translation because as you said yourself the sea could mean the sea that was in the lanayru region before the desert was there. There's two pieces of solid proof that it's in the child time line and only subtle hints that it's in the game over or adult time line. \n\nAlso this is unrelated but in Hyrule historia it's stated that the reason the zoras evolved into rito after the great sea appeared was because the gods feared that they would find Hyrule so they forced them to evolve.
you forgot that in the failed hero timeline all the links have brown sleeves while in the other two he either has green ones or none
hi matpat i have not really a theory but i thing i found out its a fnaf theory ok the kids birthday party definetly takes place at 1987 because on fnaf 2 the phone guy on night six says that a guy tried to use one of the suits a yellow one then the animetronics started acting strange and there will be one more event b4 fnaf 2 closes down a birthday party make sure you were your uniform hence the guy who gets stuffed into  a golden freddy ssuit in the fnaf place in fnaf 4 hes dressing up and the tv the fnaf 4 kid watches is prob just a re run of the show fredbear and friends thats what i think im prob wrong but yeah dont include my name in a video or anything please dont
Purple Guy : I'm GAY\nMatPat : that's just a theory a..\nMe : A GAY Theory ...thanks for reading!
Each side of the tri force represents a parallel universe. The tri force was broken apart at one point. Thus creating the rift
i didnt like BOTW. im a traditional zelda fan.  orcania, majoras, link to past, link between worlds. etc.
Mat pat plz do more fnad there is going to be a fnaf 6 soon!
Isn't spectacle rock also an ester egg? Most locations in BotW are also Easter eggs I think.
A lot of YouTuber has disagreed with you they say it's in the child's time line can you explain they pls
The scream painting was hilarious Doing a great job with your videos they're always very interesting
i think its impossable to answer now gut when other games come out you can
I didnt even notice the stripes, i saw the sleeves
There's actually a few other details which are the same, such as the stitches(?) near the top and the brown undershirt for most of the downfall timeline.\nThen again, the divine beasts were each named after OoT's sages, which were only awakened in the adult timeline, and one of the Zora's historical slates specifically states Ruto as one of the sages that helped seal Ganon away. In the child and failure timelines, this never could have come to pass, as each of the sages were, themselves, sealed away.
I saw you on a video with a  art youtuber his channel name is draw with jazza i am so happy that it was you
I just noticed that most people's argument is Oh they said 'in the amber lights of twilight' so it must be after Twilight Princess But my counter argument is that, Who said that the twilight realm only existed in twilight princess? With such an advanced kingdom, it should have existed around the same time as four swords.
Odyssey in the Mario Timeline
did he win in the new game? or he still lost?\n(Im broke never played the new game) lol
You never told us you were going to melbourne! I am litterally only 2 hours away!
Could've sworn the sea chart on Wind Waker has an island called Spectacle Island, and the we found out later in the game that all the islands are the very tops of h\nHyrule. It could've just been a reference to the games in the failed timeline.
To be honest: I liked it better when it was just a legend that was retold again and again and always changed the setting, the details and the overarching ideas, but kept the core intact. You know... like real legends do.
I still think the entire concept of trying to attribute a contiguous timeline to a bunch of re-imaginings of the same legend which simply changes over time as the technology with which to tell the story evolves was a mistake, and Skyward Sword was the culmination of that mistake.
Mat i saw you in the street art thing!
I still think it's part of child timeline. But I'm not ready to do research to prove it... So I'll let you have this victory
Wouldn't this game come 100years after ocarina of time since other things are still there and he dawns his iconic gear at the end?
Hey Game Theory I was wondering you haven't done a theory on ark survival evolved and there seems to be  alot of secrets, maybe you if you dig deep you could find a really interesting video, maybe people will agree with me?
of course this is the failed hero timeline. it is the only Zelda game where they specifically say link Falls to Gannon
Just a word of wisdom. Remember that Breath of the Wild is a game will with 900 references and very little can actually be taken as concrete evidence since quite literally everything is a nod to any game in the series. While you may have a belief that the game is in one timeline, there is just as much evidence otherwise. Breath of the Wild's timeline placement no matter where you put it, will never be satisfying.
this theory could be way more simple, I mean ganon achieved his final form that means link defeated and he is slept for long time and soo that already said that this falls to defeated time line.
I love how people keep bringing up the twilight princess statement like the twili realm is only on twilight princess. in twilight princess that realm had been around for quite a long time, it probably was even around sense ocarina of time, so that means it would still be in the other timelines. although yes I am a believer in the combined time line. also impa only shows up after ocarina in the downfall timeline (just saying)
I feel like if her reference to the hero of twilight is a flimsy piece of evidence then a yellow strap on a hat is much flimsier
a man only needs _so_ much stamina guys... or does he?\n*child Zelda winks at the audience while bending over*\n\nstay classy GT.
Cmon man we aint stupid kids\nI know you can do more if you target non nintendo games\nAND DO A SONIC MANIA/FORCES THEORY FFS
you are an idiot bro the strap is an out of universe thing because it was a desing choce by develepers
Suck it Hero of Time. We all know that the Hero of Legend is better.
Correction it's after Twilight or Four Swords.....
Great video as always!\nLove those zelda theories!
Matpat bring back the SUPER AMAZING END CARD TOURNAMENT plz
Do another video on for honor with the new characters
So apparently matpatt is a time traveller? 1:25
I just assumed that BotW ties the split back together
Alternate title Game Theory: Where Zelda Breath of the Wild FITS INTO The Zelda Timeline
I'll be able to disprove this theory with just one sentence! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Great Deku Tree is dead in both the fallen hero and adult link timeline.
You have the best Internet Intro
due to the toxicity of the mod you have on the subreddit /r/gametheorists i am as of this moment handing in my theorist badge and no longer part of the theory family
Is it possible that BotW is the first game to try to unify the three timelines?
5:20\nThe Zora were forcibly evolved into the Rito by the Goddesses themselves to make sure they wouldn't discover the underwater Hyrule, jeopardizing the stasis that surrounded it.
THE BRIDGE!!!! THE BRIDGE!!! THE FCKIN BRIDGE FROM TWILIGHT PRINCESS!
Maybe the fact that almost everyone disagrees about the color of the cap band (green-yellow-ish discussion) is the clue to proving that all timelines come together in BotW. A yellow-green band, as if the caps from all timelines merged...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr maybe we're all color-blind.
Finally, something about BOTW from one of my favorite youtubers!
but in the story of botw it legit tells you that link got beat up and thats why 100 years of resting allows him to come back and finish it...i mean kinda self explanatory but i like that you got hard evidence anyway :D
Game theory here is an idea for a theory, what is monster hunters black blight otherwise known as the frenzy?
If you haven't played BoTW you probably don't have 300 bucks to burn on a switch what you mean is we don't want to pay scalpers 400-500 dollars for a 300 dollar system. The reason most people don't have switched is because they are bought out from stores and price gouged.
sellout?
Ao oni
Best Armor in game is the Ancient Armor Matpat it has the highest defense in the game when fully maxed out.
I think that Breath of the wild is at the top of the failed hero timeline, the reason why is because of the story they tell in the game, they tell you how calamity Ganon was beaten 10,000 years before and they tel you about the divine beast and all that, but what doesn't makes sense (but I could be work I haven't played the rest of the games) is that link has faced Ganon in his pig demon form before, and the game is only mentions how you tried to beat him then failed then you where put to sleep for 100 years.
Looks like I'm really behind... sorry about that...
Why is it that in the adult timeline link looks like a child, and in the child timeline he looks like an adult? Did matpat get them confused, or is that how it's intended?
What if Breath of the Wild was the three timelines coming back together again. And the split in the was only temporary. This could also be related to the games itself because there are a multiple of ways to play through the game, and everyone plays the games differently, but the ending is all the same. Could that be what the timelines are doing? Could it all be one big game that took different paths on how to complete it, but it all came together in the end when Calamity Gabon was introduced. That could also be proved by Breath of the Wild having similarities with all three of the timelines. Ex. The races of the creature being different in different games and timelines, the reference to twilight princess and wind waker series, and the line given before the Gurdo champion was about to shoot Calamity Ganon about her getting revenge for him taking the form of a Gurdo male. I know there is a more examples scattered through the game to back up this theory, but these instances were the first to come to my mind. What do you guys think?
You missed the Arbiter's Ground, the monument in Faron, and the fact that the geography in Breath of the Wild lines up with that in the GameCube and Wii U versions of Twilight Princess.\n\nAlso, not that it matters, but TriForce Heroes is confirmed to take place directly after Link Between Worlds with the same exact Link as the latter mentioned.
I was hoping it might merge some of the timelines somehow
Dear Matpat,\nDo a theory on Among the Sleep.
According to this theory , the game  that comes before breath of the wild in the story is zelda 2 . And , it's final boss is dark link. Maybe kilton (is this his name? I don't remember) found his clothes and that's how they're there in breath of the wild
Nice touch with the spirit tracks music
You have the best intro
Hey you know the theory that you made  named why five nights at Freddy's will never end. Well when I watched that I thought up my own. Somewhat I thought that maybe as you said psychic friend fredbear is golden Freddy but what you didn't say that I thought is that the crying child survived the bite and is now the night guard and that is why when golden Freddy jumpscares you he says IT'S ME
Failed hero timeline\nInteresting, seeing as how LINK ACTUALLY DIES BEFORE BOTW. ON SCREEN.
I get that a lot of people have completed the game by now, but I disagree with showing Ganon's forms from BOTW. I was kept pretty much spoiler free about the Ganon fight, and when I did finally get to it, it was great, but if I watched this video before completing it, I would've been pretty pissed. idk, I guess it's too late to change it now, but this really ticks me off, because I'm sure there's other people like me that would agree.
GameTheory: Is Assasin's Creed: Black Flag Historically accurate to its time frame?\nI'm studying about this age of pirates and i wondered if its historically accurate with Spain in the Caribbean and all that
Spectacle Rock is in Wind Waker
Whats the name of that song at 2:00 😍
Do a destiny 2 theory please👍👌
and if you are ... is sonic mania sonic the same classic sonic in sonic generations???
I have not played the game so I'm pretty sure my opinion won't count as much but based from everyone who ever pointed out many things that correlate in all three timelines in BOTW, might it possible that all three timelines merged back into one? Or at least remnants of other the other timelines somehow showing up in a timeline where BOTW takes place. This is my suggestion anyway.
Hello Matthew due to the release of Destiny 2 I believe that you should do another Destiny theory, not about the game itself but about one of its characters, Cayde-6. This would be an interesting concept for you to tackle but probably most of the destiny players that watch your videos and myself would like to see your point of veiw on his life and backstory. Good luck MatPat.
Did... Did MatPat just make a joke about suggesting he's John Titor? The time traveler?
Hey Matpat! have you considered the item description for the rubber armor? I quote: This armor has built-in electricity resistance thanks to its source material-an ancient marvel called rubber. Such technology does not exist in THIS MODERN AGE. That part sticks out to me. Not only do we not see rubber in any other Zelda games, but we in real life DO have rubber, and it is quite common. Is this implying that they reached a state of technology like ours in real life before experiencing some sort of apocalypse that wiped that away? Please take this into consideration!
John Titor was a very interesting read, thank you for that. video was great too!
I had a really awful day today, stumbled upon this video.\nTHANK YOU GAME THEORY for brightening up my day. \nThis was a pleasure and loads of fun to watch. Got a good laugh out of it, keep doing as you do now. \nAlso thank you for quoting my favorite tv commercial.
QUICK! EVERYONE BLOW THEMSELVES UP SO WE CAN PLAY BOTW!
If we're to assume that every link incarnation that sports a hat with a yellow band is in the defeated timeline, does that mean link from the cartoon series is also in that timeline as well?
Speaking of Crash Bandicoot, you have yet to do a theory about it. Perhaps how deadly his Spin, Slide, and Belly Flop attacks are? I reccommend using the cop cars from Crash 3 (N Sane Trilogy version) to determine Crash's canon height.
Hey Game Theory,So recently, I was looking at Scott Cawthon's website and (this may outrage you...) but you have to make another FNAF theory. Don't freak out, but when I checked the site, Scott had changed the cover image to Freddy (in the style of the Take Cake to the Children mini game) carrying a cake with a rainbow behind him. After checking g the source code... Some thing creepy happened. The code read: You are crowding us...You can't tell us what to do anymore...We outnumber you...We found a way to eject you...Ha ha! Say goodbye to our friend. Yep! Scott has lost his mind! But when I thought about it, it became more crazy. The last sentence... Say good bye to OUR friend Not your friend, OUR friend. Odd right? Anyway, hope you make a theory about this, and feel free to mention my commentFrom,A fan
WE'RE CRUSHING THE CHARTS!!!!! THANK YOU ALL FOR ALL THE SUPPORT! SPREAD THIS LIKE WILDFIRE AND DOWNLOAD/STREAM IF YOU CAN!!! THANK YOU GUYS SO  MUCH MY HEART IS EXPLODING!!!! LITERALLY SHAKING.

Normally I don't care for this kind of music so I put off listening to this till just now and I have to say, I'm glad I finally listened. This is damn brilliant Gabbie! As a fellow writer/poet/lyricist I absolutely love the lyrics. They're very well written. Especially for this being you're first song. I just might buy you're book now. Was debating it for a while but if this is the quality of writing that can be expected, then it's well worth it. Only wish I actually used iTunes so I could support you by buying this song too. Guess I'll just have to spam listen on here or Spotify. :) Keep up the amazing work Gabbie.
I have been singing this song on repeat for the past week, girl... <3 <3

I was sad watching this as I didn't think I'd be able to go to one of your shows, but today was my birthday and my best friend surprised me with tickets!!! See you soon Sarah ❤
This was so Amazing what a great idea!
How can someone look so elegant and gorgeous eating a kitkat! That lighting is perfect!
Sarah I know you probably won't see this but I just want to tell you that I love you ( in a non creepy way) and have missed you so much! You have a beautiful voice, look beautiful, and are beautiful on the inside too. I totally look up to you <3
These videos will forever be the most creative and amazing things ever!
I think this is the best singing your questions so far

What's your favourite instrument

Hermoso video :D ya quiero preguntas número 8.
54 millions views congrats
This was amazing
This is FIRE Lolol
Not exactly as catchy as previous ones... :/
Is the new single about callux?😏😏
You are so bad
Here's my theory: What if Ares wanted Diana to get there?  What if he wanted her help, like he said when she was trying to kill him?  That would explain getting there in one day, and how they were lucky enough to get a tugboat!
Magic that's why
how about this lets say that the island is in other dimencion and that steve actually cross through it but naaa i don´t know it´s youst magic by the way im from mexico and inglish isn´t my main language sorry
i couldnt watch the whole movie because it was so bad
the Dark Knight rises was better
I don't understand why two weeks ago Mat was bending over backwards and making outlandish claims to the size of people in Game of Thrones simply to justify the holes in the story. Yet he is dealing with almost the same situation here and he has no issue calling out Zach Snyder and saying its impossible. Where are the preposterous claims this time? Whats the difference? I'm not a fan of either franchise so i have no stake in either theory, it just seems odd to me that he would basically approach the same problem twice in a month and clearly place more effort in filling one hole than the other. I mean people are just twice as big in Game of Thrones come on. It would've made more sense to say that days are longer or their concept of distance is shorter.
should've used the invisible plane yo
in the comics Wonder Woman has a invisible plain, even though ancient Greece hadn't those. I'm pretty sure she can have a very fast boat. Come one dude. She has super powers.
Poseidon gave them a push. Case solved.
The boat is from westeros, isnt that obvious?
Let tell you something it was a secret island and maybe known those greek mythology but maybe they are something near london cuz that islan is secret an maybe noone maybe discoverde that island yet\n\nThanks hope you seedis and i hope i am right
Because they are frikin gods ! They can use magic on boats and other things. You would have been right if they weren't
What if they hitched a ride from another supernatural being, let's say an Atlantean on a different mission, not able to aid them in this adventure.
I know this is farfetched and there is no evidence to support it, but could Posidon have helped the out?
It might be that they've already sailed out earlier. Or some kind of tricks.
Tug boat fuck no i played enough gta 4 to know how slow tht shit is
another day,another random youtube critic on dc...cmon give it a rest 😕
Woah woah woah you do realize that the boat was probably magic
Dude Alexander was Greek but the empire wasn't and it was called the Macedionian empire and it wasn't Hellenic it was Hellenistic
The boat they took maybe a magical boat.
what about poseidon ? he could've some how controlled the water/wind and idk lol
who says the magical amazonian island stays in the same place? it's not uncommon for magical islands that nobody can find to move around in myth
actually the distance is 2352 miles.  and the movies doesnt talk about how long it took .  doesnt say a day doesnt say a year . why becuase it doesnt matter
What if wonder women died while she was sleeping and it was all a dream after on
How old is Diana? Is she a Diana-saur?
Matpat, I just want to say that I think you are a genius. Keep up the good work and just ignore the handful of stupid comments people post.
Ok well diana has superpowers i think she used the power that she used while she was fighting with her mothers sister bcs when she used it it pushed her away she can use that with the boat to go faster
How long would they take to get to the allied ships and then from the ship to London?
You really like the word literally...
Idk man maybe it's a magic boat
Everyone is 10x larger in this alternate universe. Solved!
The gods can change geography though
U realize that wonder women was directed by Patty Jenkins
This was the first movie I have seen in decades and I saw it in 3d.It was awesome.😃
Theory About One Punch Man?
(Diana is a Roman goddess, not Greek)
As a total ww1 nerd was disappointed in the ww1ness of it 😐
Or maybe wonder woman like sleeping in the same position
What about any faster boats that do travel across ocean zones? and catching ride = many rides. With a plausibility.
this is gold
Mattpatt's hate boner for zack is precious 😂
She a god!!!!!!!!
MattPatt ruins films
Zack directed Wonder Woman?
The movie sucked
My rebuttal... Poseidon.
whats ur problem geek, thats a goodmovies
Daian would have help from posiden
if you notice his plane stops as soon as he goes through the invisible barrier which and it showed this happening before now where is there a lot of plane crashes happen as soon as they seem to disappear off the map let me think God Bermuda Triangle
Maybe the gods blessed then by speeding up there boats 🤷🏻‍♂️
Diana is not a Greek goddess. She is the roman version of Artemis. \n\n\nSorry I'm a geek for mythology and had to point that out. Sorry again.
Wow this theory was very good except for one small detail so in the start of the film Diana does that crazy magic push thing on her mentor because she was determined to win and at the end of the film she is able to fly so what if during the boat ride Diana unknowingly speed up the boat via air manipulation which could possibly allow them to reach the harbor in time but that's my idea
I'm not going to look any further into the comments but MatPat, rule 1 of the internet; NEVER, EVER, pick a fight with the internet. Because the internet will ALWAYS tear you apart faster than a school of piranhas.
The gods helped them
what if it was all a dream
Ok this isnt a hate comment 😂😂 who else thought Wonder Woman was the best movie ever 🌺❤️ but still I fucking love this video 😂
Please do not use the F word Thank you
Ok cool Wonder Woman has a storyline plot hole, but seriously, can we please stop hating on Zack Snyder?
i just assumed that she had the favor of the gods. zeus or poseidon could have done it as they had done similar before.
What if Steve landed for gas somewhere, THEN crashed landed? ⛽️⛽️
Get all the hates out😤
There are two theories I got 1. They could have been traveling with different ships and 2. They could have gotten food and water from the ships they travelled because Steve says  we got lucky in traveling many ships I don't know what the things are called so ya
What bugs me the most about this movie (and it's not even the fact that it's similar to Captain America storyline). It  is how they explained humans were created
DIANA IS NOT A GREEK GODDESS!! SHE'S THE ROMAN VERSION OF A GREEK GODDESS!! (sorry I'm a mythology nut)
Well super hero logic ruins this theory so write your script down on a piece of paper ROLL IT UP IN A BALL TURN THAT SON &@$€£ SIDEWAYS AND STICK IT UP YOUR CANDY @$$! IF YAAAA SMELLLL WHAT THE ROCK IS COOKING!
Can any1 guess what's a zombies favorite weather?\n\nB(rain)-brain :p
why by the way that was a good pun Darkness  Prevails
world war 1 ships were lucky to hit 20 knots. \nHitching any ride with any ship back then just disproves it.
Umm... What if the gods blessed the winds to get them there?
Honestly. I'm not the biggest fan. But I'm glad you didn't love the movie as well. Honestly I didn't like it that much. As a wonder woman movie. It's decent. DECENT. O couldn't even finish it. But it was a poor choice for the very first live action Wonder Woman movie. I have an issue with your theory. Themesciran boats are blessed by the gods so they can travel great distances quickly. I believe in another movie they traveled from their island to NYC in a span of a few hours it's literally a miracle. I believe the message was weird though. I mean Wonder Woman does stand for truth because she left to learn the truth of man's world but what you believe? Then anything is true and nothing is false unless you don't believe it? But truth is fact and that will make truth an opinion. I will proceed to why this movie was trash now. \n\n1.) They killed Steve Trevor \n2.) If they were gonna make this movie the way it was they should have changed her outfit. Wonder Woman was dawned with the colours of the American flag because Steve Trevor was an AMERICAN pilot(who had the flag stitched on to his uniform) and Hypolita(Diana's mum) suggested they made her armor in the other nation's colours to show they meant peace. PLUS Amazon's don't wear blue armour. They wear reds and golds and Hypolita as the queen wears royal purples occasionally(she wears white for some reason. A colour of purity which she is not). \n\n2.) Plot. No more. \n\n3.) What even is Aries' look rn... \n\n4.) Completely uninteresting \n5.) Basically my main problem so that they didn't keep it true to Wonder Woman herself. It's why I got mad when she could suddenly fly in the comics. Like amazons are humans gifted with great strength and immortality(as long as they stay on their island and aren't killed). It's why I ranted so much a bit the Germany/Clothed thing. They didn't stay true to her character and that movie was literally most likely the first wonder woman movie a lot of people have seen.. \n\n\n\nAnyhow the animated wonder woman of 2009 is by far superior and the theme suits Diana better than the recent one. Watch that if you want a good ww movie with phenomenal music.
What about her lasso they could throw it and pull there way the for more speed because Wonder Woman and more strength than a normal human
When frustrated wannabe-filmmakers reconverted into DISNYDRA fanboys with a payroll need to bash about a movie even Disney and most of its fandom themselves refuses (for strategic reasons starting by not risking to be lynched by their female audiences by example) to diss because that's movie is pinky enough for their tastes
Since this movie acts on the premise that Greek Gods exist, then Poseidon would exist too. He and Ares are not always on the best terms, and this war might not be in his best interest. Since he is one of the most powerful gods, and controls the sea, he could have easily gotten the boat to London overnight. Maybe that's what happened?
11:30 he didn't specify what ship they caught a ride with, they could've been passed like a baton between the allied ships in the Mediterranean.
QUICK\nEveryone tweet Zack Snyder pictures of ducks with explosions and sky beams!
Maybe posidon took pity on them and turned the tides in their favor
Diana is the Roman goddess of the moon and the hunt
Sorry MatPat, but this is the best DC film since the Dark Knight Trilogy, and it's a hell of a lot better than any of the cheesy-humored mindless chick flicks that Marvel is spilling out just to get some easy money.
But you are forgetting that this movie like you said in the beginning has Greek mythology in it so what if the gods helped her out because of the prophecy and all that she does make it. Ever think of that?
They say they hitched a ride ... I think he meant a bigger powerful boat as a tug boat.
She has roots in mythology. Divine Intervention. But hey that's just a theory a FILM THEORY! Thanks for reading! P.S. What happened to your final thoughts?
This is kinda dumb, but what if Poseidon used his GODLY POWERS and gave them a Diana and Steve some help? After all, this is a world with Greek gods.
But its a magic Amazon boat so
The only thing WW has going for it, is that it is one of the few DC films (besides Batman) that wasn't total shit. It still doesn't match the great run that Marvel is having at the cinema. When something is new, everyone gets stoked on the novelty, but a few months and a clear head will show. Anyone still think Avatar was a masterpiece?
You forgot about one thing:  *breathes deeply*  MAGIC!
Good theory, but this is my solution to the problem.  Magic
Magic? They did mention that Themyscira was protected by a magical barrier that completely separated them from the mortal realm. Maybe the barrier kept them in a separate dimension so they were able to plop back into normal space near London.
5:05 \nWait, Isn’t Diana the roman counterpart of Artemisa, the greek goddess, daughter of Zeus?
You gotta remember that this has gods and mythology. Poseidon could have used his P O W E R S to take them where ever they want since Poseidon hates Hades ALOT.
A movie directed by a woman starring a woman is long overdue.\n\nI suspect you might be a liberal.
So basically there was a teleported in the middle of the ocean because the amazon place is fake and the teleport was close to london
HAHAHAHAHA guess Zack didn't do his Movie Homework!!! #BURN🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 THE TRUTH HURTS DOESN'T ZACK!!!! 💥 Sorry I mean no harm. I just wanted to say #burn so umm no hard feelings? BUT REALLY you NEED to do your movie homework next time Zack!! 😔😔😔😜😜😜💥💥😜😜💖💜💖💜
5:09 *cough* Roman name Artemis not Greek *Cough*
>Magic
How about magic?
Diana is a Roman goddess, *ahem* ayktyually
Plus no blue eyes...wtf Hack Snyder?!
Matpat the Greek Gods helped her Poseidon and Zeus
Did ya know that the first plane ever was created by thr danish man Jacob Ellehammer? Dude! The first NOT mechanical but flying plane was created by him. But the first ideas and drawings of the first plane was drawn by Leonardo da Vinci.
Sorry but What about Poseidon
VEGAN FOOD!! Fot the health of our bodies, for compassion and for the planet ::) Thank you
People need to stop being so negative just because she makes plant based food (vegan is a lifestyle not diet). if you want it to be non vegan then just twek the recipes and leave Cassey alone please. It shouldn't be that big of a deal.
Love all the recipes, will try them as soon as I get a chance to get some good avocados.  Just tell me how do I make beet hummus as it's not available here and is it ok if I put in Greek yogurt instead of vegan mayo?
Can you please do some Fall recipes? :D Maybe apple cinnamon cookies, pumpkin pasta, and something with butternut squash! Of course, it doesn't have to be those specifically :)
I like ur makeup in this video! So natural n glowing...which just resonated with the clean eating type of glowing!

Please wish me luck and pray for me!\nAnd thank you Cassie because this video made me forget about everything for seven minutes and I don't even love avocado. Still they look amazing.
Cassey, I love your shirt! Where did you get it?

please tell me she is vegan now
Love you two. Just so normal! No frills, just yourselves! Xx
Looks like you had an amazing trip Lily! We hope you enjoyed exploring our capital and seeing out summer #TheSwedishWay with Rekorderlig.
Awww I love Lily & Anna vlogs..... 53 inch sunglasses 😎 hahahaha
Great vlog. I now want both a Rekorderlig cider and a weekend away in Stockholm (but tricky from Australia though!)
Watching In the gym and burst out laughing at the 53inch thing about the sunglasses lol
Seriously though, you two are just both so down-to-earth and easy to watch. Sometimes when I'm watching youtubers and especially videos where they collaborate, I get the feeling they aren't really that comfortable with eachother. It can feel a bit awkward, a bit like when acquaintances end up having to hang out alone together. You two aren't like that, you seem completely comfortable around eachother and appear to genuinely have fun. Which makes these videos so nice to watch. Maybe it's because you are both individually down-to-earth people. Anyway, so glad I found you both, not sure why it took me so long. (Long comment, sorry)
H&M is swedish, Lily... Yes, it is big there.
This was so pleasant to watch, and I have major food envy as I chew on my toast and jam on a saturday evening.
Of all the people on YouTube, you make vlogging feel like I'm just watching a best friend. Love your channel.
I like because Anna always looks very bored at the airport like myself lol
Serious friendship /girl trip envy! So fun watching you two
Where is ur 1970s jamper is feom please Lily x
Hey girls! First - let me say I really like both of you a lot - you're one of the most genuine nad mature youtubers I know. Just wondering - when you have an opportunity to visit new places like that - aren't you curious about the city itself (history, architecture etc.). I am aware that's a beauty channel and the time you spend there is limited as well. But although I am a foodie and make up/ beauty lover myself I would feel bad not to catch such an opportunity.... Anyway it was nice to see both of you having fun together :)
I really want to go to Stockholm now
Your friendship is just the bee's knees. This week has been stressful and expensive. But I watched this and smiled the entire time. So thanks for that.
Love seeing you girls have so much fun!
Adding Stockholm to my travel wishlist. You both seem so sweet and down to earth!
This is one of my favourite videos of yours :)
hey lily :) I need to know whats the song called at the photo museum (betw min 7 and 8). can't find anywhere and it's hard to identify the lyrics. please help! :)\n\nbtw really enjoy your vlogs <3
It feels pretty surreal seeing you and Anna walking on the streets, browsing the shops i'm at so frequently! Wish i had accidentally bumped into you guys whilst you were here! And yeah, Designtorget IS very aesthetically pleasing!
When Lily says the shop is closed, I just want to shout out loud through the screen: It's not, there is a man walking inside~~XDDD
Awww, so sad I was out of town when you and Anna were visiting my hometown! You literally had lunch in the same building my office is in, then brunch where I live...! Good choices anyway, hope you guys enjoyed it!
omg it's olivia lopez (aka @lusttforlife) at 16:14 !!
Excellent vlog Lily!
Lmao lily: I want everything 😂😂😂\n53 inch LOL youre such dorks. Love your friendship 💜
Oh gosh, Monki and Weekday on the same road - the dream!!
Watching this while on a diet was torture!! I'm so hungry now!
Lily!! I took a break from YouTube, so I haven't seen your vlogs lately, and WOW 😳 you have seriously stepped up your editing game!!!
Can't wait for the run up to Christmas this year and here's to hoping you will be doing vlogmas (your way) again! Your vlogs are as always THE BEST!
This didn't show up in my sub. box :(
Everyone looks so gorgeous and stylish in Sweden! Always love your travel vlogs, your chill vibes make me want to travel :)
That's not Stockholm!!
Can someone tell me the obsession w this 1970 sweater? I've seen it everywhere, I imagine it is a freebie for bloggers?
I've always wanted to go to Stockholm and this vlog is making me want to hop on a plane right now. Your travel vlogs are the best!
So awesome watching this as I went in January and stayed at the same hotel so interesting seeing you there and in places I went to! Such a beautiful place! I love it so much. Xx
H&M is big here, isn't it? Hehe Lily it's Swedish 🙈
Such a cool vlog! Stockholm looks amazing and this is so amazingly edited and put together. Loved it!
Love watching you and Anna together - you just have such a lovely friendship. I miss the podcast!
Can you please do a video on what hair products you use before straightning your hair?
14:32 I looooooove when Anna does that 'I love it' face haha
I LOVE you two ❤️❤️🇫🇷
Wow those glasses in the glasses-shop look amazing 😍😍 do you know if they have a website too?\nEdit: I found them in your infobox 😊 there is a dutch shop called ace and tate which sells quite similar glasses. I got mine from there and I absolutely adore this brand (little recommendation vor Anna 😊
I love Rekorderlig but they are like 500 calories per drink :(
I absolutely love this Vlog, looks so cool there and different, live it when you with Anna as well best two people xxxx
How do you manage to eat so much food and stay in shape? 🍟🍕🍔🌭🥞🍦🍩🍪🍰🍹
Do they do the mango lime flavor in the US?? Gotta have pink cider
This is a random question about traveling to other places outside of England: when you go to a restaurant or store and you say hello, what do you do if they don't want to speak English back to you, but they understand English? I try to learn a bit of the local language obvi but I'm always scared they will give me an unnecessarily hard time even though I'm trying to communicate with them as best I can. Do you ever get nervous about that sort of thing?
I dont understand....  which r the pplz,  who dislike yr videos??? Y they press dislike button??  Seriously\nSurly they r the pplz with absolute bad taste
Did you it the sausage? 🤔
I love this video! :*
love your video with Ana !!! so much fun !! <3
LOVED this! Always a fan of your videos and love that your style of videos doesn't change when it's an ad, keep up the awesome work can't wait to see the next one as always! *also love the ad thumbnail 👌🏻*
This was an ad?? I didn't even notice until I saw the comment section.... Great job! I absolutely LOVED watching this... wish ads on TV could be like this, haha 👍😂
LOL even I remembered you had been to Stockholm. :D (Probably cos I Stockholm is like home to me)
Just love how u say Rekorderlig ^^ I didn't understand what u meant before I saw the boxes on the bed.
What a lovely girly trip! More of those whenever is possible please!
I just love Stockholm so much
Really loved this! The editing was amazing, especially in the photograph museum 👌🏼 \nlove from Australia
Great video Lily.  This trip with Anna looked like so much fun and really made me laugh. I really want to see you in a pair of 55 sunglasses now! #EltonJohn. Jx

Gee, where does one gets a friend like Anna!

Yes, one of the things I still can't get used to in Sweden is people eating burgers with cutlery. Weirdest detail.
Any more swedes here?? 😃
I am watching your videos for at least 4 years now and I really enjoy watching them. This morning I woke up with kind of a bad mood, but now, after watching your vlog, I feel happy! Keep up with the good work, Lily 🎈 have a great day! Kisses from Germany!
Stockholm is beautiful! My favorite place to see in there is Vasa Museum :) Great vlog, waiting for the next one!
I love those ray bans
Love the new ad disclaimer
Hello! What is the song playing while you were at the museum?
I love the feel of this video, the music really fits !! Thoroughly enjoyed it. Xx
Mmmm really craving a Rekorderlig now....Also, very jealous of the 2 hour flight + different country situation. It's a 2 hour flight + different state here in Australia :P
Stockholm is great, especially in the spring. Scandinavians eat their burgers with a knife and fork. I finally learned to do it that way, to avoid being an American barbarian. 😆
Cannot express how much I've missed your vlogs!
I've been watching YouTube since 2011, I have definitely heard of you but didn't start watching your channel till this year! Love your vlogs❤️😊
So obsessed with that Bella Freud jumper! ❤️
Love the Raybans, tempted to get them for myself!!! :)
What are your topshop boots called cause I've been looking for good black boots! Please do a boot video for autumn and winter! Always love your vlogs! They're so natural and have a good vibe! xx
My favourite youtubers together!!! Amazing
Missed ur vlogs
I love ure vlogs ure amazing!
Bless your friendship! xoxo
so weird seeing you stroll around in my hometown haha! <3
You seem so genuinely happy in this vlog (not saying you aren't happy in your other ones)! Stockholm looks amazing!!
Fantastic vlog - you and Anna always seem to have such a blast. I loved Sweden so much after the first time I visited that I had to learn Swedish - amazing country!
You just took a sped up video of Olivia Lopez (@lustforlife)!!! Yay thank you!!!
Loving this video. I'm visiting Stockholm in April, so madly writing your suggestions down. Might come back and watch this video next year, along with Anna's one, to refresh my memory!
So happy to see a vlog. You were missed!
Now I really NEED to go to Stockholm!
nice soundtrack
I'm going to Stockholm next week this is great! What's the shopping mall you're in?
I always love your vlogs Lily! Always find them so interesting and relaxing at the same time
where is Anna's leather jacket from? it looks  perfect! x
BoJack Horseman is one of the most fascinating characters in all of fiction.  He's pretty much an objectively shitty person, yet we're compelled to root for him because we see something of ourselves in BoJack.  We've all done selfish things, things that we kind of hate ourselves for and we're not sure how to live with those things.  We want to see someone like BoJack be happy and perhaps even redeemed, because it would give the rest of us hope.
The thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is - it's NOT an adventure. There is no way to do it so wrong you might die - it's just work. And the bottom line is some people are okay going to work, and some people... well, some people would rather die. Each of us gets to choose.
Wow, and people say that Rick and Morty is nihilistic.
Thanks to this show and some traumatizing experiences, I was depressed for around eight months. Throughout that time, I felt as if I related to Bojack, but couldn't give a specific reason of why. This video helps give insight on the qualities I used to, and ultimately do still see in myself. Especially the point about his cyncism reaching the point of a self-destructive loop, and being the root of his suicidal and depressive tendencies. Thank you for the video.. excellent breakdown and analysis, and is personally helpful to me.
Fantastic analysis! This is one of the deepest shows to ever hit TV. I can't wait to see what season 4 has in store!
Well, I'm off to cry myself to sleep now.
The tragedy of Bojack Horseman isn't that he can't love himself, it's that he thinks love is conditional. This is probably why his so obsessed with fame, because he thinks fame will make him worthy of love. But that's not how it works, if Bojack wants unconditional love then he should unconditionally love himself and the people around him, it may not get him what he wants but it would make a better person... or a better horse.
This series is the best, i love when there's an extremely large story within, and even though I cried after most episodes i relate too it too much and cant wait to finnish the story
My life is like Bojack Horseman, as far as wanting change, being aware of my flaws. Yet, something inside is stopping me from making the actual effort to make things better. I only care about music, making music, or creative writing. I'm the same way, repeating the same things everyday expecting different results, expecting things to get better. That's why I love this show.
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST UNDERRATED CHANNELS ON YOUTUBE
Damn this video is gold
This is the cheapest counseling I've ever received
Never seen a single episode and I'm going to start watching it now
One of the best shows out there right now. The protagonist is not even a human and yet he has more resemblance to a human being than most of characcters in other tv shows. Whoever hasn't seen it yet do yourself a favor and watch it now!
One more hour, kids 😖😖
I feel like everything about bojack just got thrown out the window with season 4
I love how your clips actually contribute to your point, rather than just repeat what you just said. Great video🖒
This was exactly what I was thinking as I binged the show in preparation for season 4 lol... amazing video great editing and analysis of the show and the characters within it...
Yo season 4 was pretty great! Depressing, but hopeful!
Fourth season is pure gold
I think Todd was Bojack's Mr. Peanut butter
Considering what happened in the new season, some points made in this video look kinda funny.
That princess Carolyn episode in season 4 had me in my feels
Wow! I don't comment very often on videos but this one is on a whole other level. Thank you for doing this. Like many others, sometimes Bojack can be so relatable to me it's scary. Anyway, you got a new subscriber. Great work!
Wow I havent started this show but I am Bojack
A cartoon , Yes a cartoon about a talking horse has one of the most accurate portrayals of depression and self loathing of any show I've seen
Charlotte was never Bojack's girlfriend, she was Herb's girlfriend
Bojack horseman\nWhat is this a cross over episode?!
The background music is very distracting.
Lots of things turns around in Season 4.
Bravo. This is actually really eye-opening and can be applied in the real world in how we see ourselves and other people.
she shows signs of growth grappling with her work and love!\nhe\nhehe\nhehehaha\nhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha- BHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin all seriousness i hope she can recover from season 4
bojack gets plenty of girls. he's just an asshole.
Wow really wish you'd have waited and added season 4 to this...
I feel like with addition of season 4 currently, an update video would be very good here
i had never seen bojack from this perspective, good video... why such a generick chanel name tho?
Bojack is a perfect example of Narcissistic Personality Disorder
I don't see how this is going to end well. Anything less than Bojack's complete collapse and/or premature death by suicide or misadventure is going to seem like cop out.
Bojack is such an amazing show. Such a grounded human story, which is ironic.
I needed this video so much today :( Thank you for the upload- your time, vision, and compassion are all present here :)
Season four continues with this loop,\nBut we look at if he could be happy with family
I wish that I'd dissected Bojack more and that the arc with Anna Spanakopita had occurred earlier. It would have let me identify and let go of my abusive ex-boyfriend a lot faster than I did.
It's Mr. Peanutbutter, never write two words.
Fuck man....what else is there to say?
This should be HARRY POTTER later in his life. There is no way that he turns out okay
Bojack Horseman is a show to watch late night.
So... did someone else had a bit of a internal issue when season 3 ended?
This and Wisecracks video on the show are the best analysis' of BoJack Horseman
About to watch season 4
this is by far my favorite video on Bojack
Jesus christ, this just ripped the bandaid off my old depression scars without warning.
Stupid talking horse show make me sad and question my life decision
thanks, i'm gonna go ahead and watch this during the weekend
I'm so excited for the new season! Can't wait to be depressed!
Struck right in the heart.
Damn, that's so me.
T minus 45 minutes till the season drops. This video only made it better.
Great. I'm Bojack. Fuck me.
Good video. When it comes to love or happiness, Bojack seeks instant results rather than taking time to adapt. Like getting a soda out of a vending machine.
When you binged all of season 4 immediately and now have a deep void inside of you.
Wow! I loved how it all held together. Great catches,, great edit, great pace.  This video made the show times better. I never before managed to finish a relatively long analysis of a pop show. And I didn't like bojack that much before.
Brilliant analysis of the show.
Hands down the best episode to date. You guys keep getting better and better.
I love your videos! God damn!
Holy fucking shit, thank you so much for this video.
Amazing...Just amazing...my favorite show,now my favorite video
THIS WAS THE BEST ANALYSIS OF BOJACK HORSEMAN I'VE SEEN AND ONE OF THE BEST TV ANALYSES I'VE SEEN ON YT. WELL DONE! You all have outdone yourself on this one.
Screenprism. I love your videos! BoJack Horseman is my shit. Could you do one about Crazy Ex Girlfriend, Jessica Jones or Split please.
I can't lie guys\nIf they find a way to wrap this all up in the next season or so, whether bojack kills himself or not, this would become the best serial show I've watched since true detective
I have a feeling that his daughter might be the one to deliver the f*ck of the season, I do not want this to happen but I this show has already done this to me many a times before...
You should do a piece on Rick and Morty. Especially with how they approach relationships and the idea of love along with the psychological affects of their adventures, it's just as thought provoking as this show.
this was a really well made video it feels like a depressing self help guide aha
If the definition of insanity is repeating the same thing over and over again Bojack is insane.
The last quote sounds like me, that is for sure
I always love analysis videos on Bojack. I think it's mainly because I look from afar at it sometimes and go, Cartoon horseman is the greatest aching feeling ever. How?
This video, and the show itself, makes me realize how worthless I am. I hate how relatable Bojack is to me. That's not something you want...
Good analysis. I can't wait for tomorrow
It depresses me how much of Bojack I see in myself. But it's also a big reason why I love the show so much. Truly masterful writing.
What a fine video analysis, I need more!
I feel like bojack is pretty relatable in some aspects. Notably me wanting to feel loved and wanting to know if someone out there gives a Fuck about me and I constantly worry about if people like me
This is way better then i could ever of possibly imagined.
Oh my god, I'm Bojack. Also, this was a really well done and thoughtful analysis.
Better HORSE* not man
I'M FUCKING SCREAMING
fuck... bojack is me
doggie doggie what now?
Jesus man... ANDTHING ELSE?!?!
Excellent analysis
BPD
Daammmm, to close to home...
I love BJH series
Good video.
I am Bojack I swear
Do one about Mr. Peanutbutter!
........Yep.......Perfect video for Hype.
I love this
<3
Beautiful!!
Can anyone tell me if this video contains spoilers for season 4 I am afraid to watch because i can´t seem to find a disclaimer
I don't know if I should return to the show for the next season. I kinda see myself in there and I don't really like it.
This sounds like a completely different song and I love it, much respect to the xx for this amazing cover
couldn't have been more perfect
Please cover the entire album. ASAP.
These are the lyrics for this lovely cover if anyone wants them!!\n\nIf I wrote you a symphony\nJust to say how much you mean to me\n(What would you do?)\nIf I told you you were beautiful\nWould you date me on the regular?\n(Tell me, would you?)\nWell, baby, I've been around the world\nBut I ain't seen myself another girl (like you)\nThis ring here represents my heart\nBut there's just one thing I need from you\n(Saying I do) \n\nI can see us holdin' hands\nWalkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand\nI can see us on the country side\nSittin' in the grass, layin' side by side\nYou can be my baby\nLet me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me\nAin't gotta do nothin' crazy\nSee, all I want you to do is be my love\nLove\nMy love (love)\nMy love (love)\nAll I want you to do is be my love\nLove\nMy love (love)\nMy love (love)\n\nNow If I wrote you a love note\nAnd made you smile with every word I wrote\n(What would you do?)\nWould that make you wanna change your scene\nAnd wanna be the one on my team?\n(Tell me, would you?)\nSee, what's the point in waitin' anymore\n'Cause boy, I've never been more sure\n(That, baby, it's you)\nThis ring here represents my heart\nAnd everything that you been waitin' for\n\nI can see us holdin' hands\nWalkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand\nI can see us on the country side\nSittin' in the grass, layin' side by side\nYou can be my baby\nLet me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me\nAin't gotta do nothin' crazy\nSee, all I want you to do is be my love\n\nThose flashing lights come from everywhere\nThe way they hit him I just stop and stare\nI'm love stoned and I could swear\nThat he knows\nThink that he knows, oh, oh\n\nAnd now I walk around without a care\nHe's got me hooked\nIt just ain't fair, but I...\nI'm love stoned and I could swear\nThat he knows\nThink that he knows, oh, oh\n \nI think that he knows\n\nAll I want you to do is be my love\nLove\nMy love (love)\nMy love (love)\nAll I want you to do is be my love\nLove\nMy love (love)\nMy love (love)\nAll I want you to do is be my love
im so gay for this 😍
Love how they composed their own Timbaland-sounding beat for the cover. 👌 It sounds like it could be a legit Timbaland/Timberlake production.
TOU FRACA
THIS COVER IS SO GOOD!! one of my fav JT's songs ever! <3 i love this!!!
Sooo good!! Great cover! The xx are awesome!!!
I am IN LOVE with Oliver changing the pronouns🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Jamie xx 🔥🔥
This is the best cover ever! <3 <3 <3
Love how they changed the pronouns 💓💓💓
Can someone post this on SoundCloud
I WILL NEVER BE OVER THIS.
Her voice falls under the flow of the rhythm, which I would usually find underwhelming with other singers, but she makes it sound very satisfying!
also.. just how great and sensible they are to add that lovestoned verse?
GOSTEI; MUITO BOM. ABRAÇO.
This is everything.
Killed it
Sick!!!
Ommmg❤️
So good😍
Meu trio de amores, que linda releitura pra umas das melhores músicas pop dos anos 2000. \nEsse é meu The xx extremamente maduro depois de anos e cheios de si. Uma grande banda, minha pequena grande banda. Amo vocês xx

Hideous!
Uhhh...these people cannot sing. Wtf?? The actual music is cool but, bruh!! These folks sound like really bad karaoke singers. I don't get it.
Perfect timing to find this. Just smoked a bigass doob.
As a fan, I'm not a fan of this.
To me they just sound out of breath and out of tune
This is awful.
The synths are completely out of tune to the vocal / the rest of the track
love seeing jamie having fun. nice cover
meh
can you explain me why exactly did he changed the pronouns?
shite...
This sucks donkey penis!
Worst fucking cover I've ever heard in my life, these guys have really murdered a good song!
Well... they both have awful voices.

What has the world come to
Who have iPhone x. I’m watching on iPhone x 😎
The video is great, but i'm just sad that they took off the original video where lil uzi was driving high
The subtitle makes it weird 😱😱😱😱😱😱
Why the fuck is The Weekend in here???
This Thing is getting too demonic broh first why the hell did he use arabic lyrics and why did he wrote his birth date and death date as he know 1994-2099 this shit is getting creepy
Why translate to arabic and in last of video we can hear French language..
Why am I just now finding this video
original video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zgmvg-zzctI \n\nit got hidden ....
Wait why is the weekend in this😳🤔
Legend has it, if you listen to this on 0.75 speed you become a Xanax bar
Subtitles are not in the correct way lmao !!!!!!!!!!!!
but fighting prejudice with more prejudice is not very clever, it generates more and more revolt and this war between '' different '' ethnic groups will never end if you arouse anger, and you are a great influence among young adults ...
Uzi is fuckin lit.. He gotta drop some new shit!
If it ain't XO,Then it gotta go.
This is some satanic stuff right here

Hey Tina! Im your  new subsriber. So i find its very interesting that you're trying all sort of product, could you give a try on 'Foot Peeling' and 'heated eye mask'! So yea give it a go.
Who noticed that she was not speaking in the later part of the video she had recorded it and then played it
...shallow mindless twits whose self value is solely determined by the opinions of random strangers...
The final look is gorgeous!! ❤❤❤
Hey Tina! Can you please try Fenty Beauty

Hey Tina! please try rihanna's Fenty beauty make up 😍😍 pleaseee! I wonder how it would look on you and I also wanted to know your opinion about the products thank youuu!!
This is so nice, love the final cosy-frosty result!
I like the natural light look
Are you going to try the new Fenty Beauty by Rihanna makeup line? So far the reviews seem to be very good, but many beauty gurus often hype things up. You're one of the few beauty gurus that I watch because you seem alot more honest in your reviews, and you also try fun/quirky products. Would love to hear you opinion on Rihanna's new makeup line.\n\nAlso, would like to mention that she has 40 FOUNDATION SHADES☺ Definitely something you don't see often in most makeup brands.
Even tho this is soo out of your comfort zone, the look ended up being very cool and wearable and you pulled it off really really well.. loved it.. think it's one of your best looks ever!
You look amazing with this makeup..... Please make more videos like this....
You know *MY* favorite makeup color?\nIt’s called...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*NIGGER*
Lol the eyeliner was called pencil grey.
love u Tina..u r so amzing .I love u ..love the way u show how to use the products..love the way u make facese like kids ..
this make up looks good on you
I actually prefer this look.
my first impression of ur eyeshadow is, u looks like elsa in frozen
can you do another video of you trying more american candy, snacks, or food?!!!
https://www.crimsonviolet.com/products/japanese-hair-dye-wax-7-colors?variant=37633365057\nPlease try this product!!! It would be so awesome \n\ (*o*) /
i love your natural brows here
I'm kinda amused that the eyeliner is pretty much Pencil Gray (えんぴつ　or enpitsu means pencil). I love your video's Tina! I love how cute the lip balm thing is. I'm trying to get into the habit of using lip stuff more, mine get so dry in the winter!
I love this look and your hair!!
I love seeing Tina on the TRENDING PAGE!!!
the pointing at yourself thing is SO goddamn adorable!
Hi I really like your earrings I just would know what is the name of your earrings thank you !!!
Love the natural lighting settup and this look!
I know this sounds silly but could you try the Claire's makeup brushes?
hair: cute lighting: really nice face/foundation: really freakin nice eyeshadow: freaking great lips: cute brows: really nice\nI'm living lmao
I was reluctant to see the cool colors but you made them really good on your eyes.  Loved the bronzer as cheek color and the lip liner was lovely on you.

I am so excited for Petite cosmetics!😍
Justice - Genesis
YES !!! THIS YEAR THE JURY HAD BALLS !
HELL. YES.
Force Majeure is one of my favorite movies! I love that this foreign film feels so big, has stars and all. That's a very nice thing to see this ambitious abroad because Hollywood has been so ordinary.
I'm gonna watch this just to see where the hell that ape scene goes ..
Been waiting for this for long time. And fucking finally!!!
0:18 I DEFINITELY thought that was Jim Carrey.
Yes!!! Finally. Cannot wait for this.
Seen it yesterday with 4 other people in the theater. Incredible satire that breaks down modern society in order to show us who we had become. True eye opener!
There needs to be (1) a thumbs-up, (2) a thumbs-down, and (3) a series of question marks.

song is called skrillex by some guy named Dubstep
what's the name of the song at the beginning ??
Sounds like a Danish movie.
Looks way better than The Circe
Check it out if you get the chance, brilliant movie!
promete
McNulty
What are the movies that appear at the end? (I just recognize High Rise)
Globalist garbage
lOOKS BLOODY AMAZING. CANT WAIT. i love being an art snob this will be great.
Nice glasses McNulty!
this is a nice trailer, doesn't give out the story in its full format.
im not sure if its that dumb-artsy on purpose ... but looks funny
A rare cinema specimen! Still, won't evaluate it till I digest the whole!
I really liked force majeure
So Holy Motors
Looks Like Horse Shit
Hmm Justice, so prehistoric.
Bunuel + Ionesco's Max, Mon Amour?
We have way to many movies that shared similar names, I wished the filmmakers has done some research of films that were titled The Square before naming this movie the Square, it would help it's uniqueness a whole lot more. Another movie that goes by this name is a 2017 Egyptian documentary, though I believe this movie would gain traction when it is comes out in theaters, considering it will turned out to be a candidate for the 2017 best foreign film come oscars season. With that been said, I love the trailer. It looks quirky, suspenseful and amazing, all rolled up in one. Looking forward to this.
Another one of those pretentious artsy crap, will there be at least boobs in it?
screechingly pretentious. looks dumb as hell
Los Angeless debuted at #2 on the New Alternative 40 Chart this week:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxlSBzMcrtkPF2wBjVQAQmMFDL9ADzKvP
I think that if this single was released before New York, people would've been more receptive to New York. People were probably scared that they weren't going to have absolutely crazy bangers like this one.
I love Annie Clark aka St. Vincent, but this track I'm not feeling at all.  I like the New York track, but this will be the 2nd straight album where there is simply one song that I don't like at all. On St. Vincent it was I prefer your love, and I'm guessing Los Angeles will be the one track I skip on Masseduction. For all her other albums, I genuinely like, and or love all the songs, so maybe this one will grow on me once I hear the album in its entirety.. Either way, I'm just hyped for the new album, and to be seeing her live in Nov!
sounds like Goldfrapp
much better single than the 1st one
Listen I love all her albums and I'm sure this one will be good as well...But from what I've heard this is far from her Deepest, Boldest work..\n\nIt seems just to be some good pop...not really much more. I'm not as excited for her new stuff if it's going to all be like this.
Digging the artwork....... oh yeah and the music too!
That PEACH, if you know what I mean
This rhythm sounds like another song to me.
Ms.Clark killing it as usual
I hope the record contains a hyper-psychotic track. Like how 'Marry Me' had 'Your Lips Are Red', Strange Mercy had 'Northern Lights', 'St Vincent' had 'Bring Me Your Loves'
I could not possibly be more in love with this woman... my gf's love doesn't even compare! 🤣
With Annie the WAVs they never break
This groove is evil!
Is this song available in ITunes..?
I'm so excited for her new music
wasn't even around in the 90s, but it feels like it now
What wouln't I give to offer that butt a bouquet of tulips
holy shit I legit saw the name as Los Angeles until I heard it. Brain fucks man. anyone else?
Someone got paid to photoshop St Vincent booty. Dreams do come true.
The next city will be .....
Crack open a coke on her ass,could have made a fortune !!!
Whats with the weird shitty Lana Del Rey-esque part the last minute lmao
I love this song,St.Vincent is back with a vengeance
I honestly did not like her last self-titled album or her collab with David Byrne, but I'm really digging this a lot. This song especially has a similar kind of groove/spirit that made me love her other albums so much.
Idk why but it's got a nine inch nails vibe
Why's this video not available now?
St vincent and grizzly bear are putting out new music what a great ending to this year for music
This is definetely gonna be her most enjoyable album
I'm obsessed with this song!!!
This song goes great to the scene in Ferris Bueller when Cameron kicks his dad's car out the window.
This woman is unstoppable.\nWe are not worthy <3
Annie you are the fucking best.
Is that her butt? It might be.  It could be a manican or a drag queen. Or it could be cgi.
😻 ur music St Vincent. Maybe someday if your near Disneyland doing a concert I will see you perform live.
Shirley Manson feels? Love me some Garbage. You are beautiful Annie. So so so excited for Masseduction!
Reminds me a bit of Digital Witness on pop steroids, totally into it.
Art for Art's sake. Fantastic.
I hope there's a cover of Cities from Talking heads (ft David Byrne)
Late to the party, but FUCKING BEST BIRTHDAY PRESENT.
MY FAKE VAGINA IS WET. this is fucking amazing
I thought YouTube was supposed to be family friendly. They censor channels like pewdiepie yet promote images like this.
if you squint, the cover art looks like a leopard flaming
Why isn't this available to listen to in the UK?!\nSort it out
This song gives me life. Literally.
would anyone mind if I asked for Annie's hand in marriage?
To be honest I came here to talk shit. In the end, I saw a nice ass and heard a good song 😝
Is that St. Vincent's tight little ass on the cover? 😍😙
I was like...I see the hand, but wheres the head, is in that yoga ball / bean chair. /gel looking thing? Then I saw it..... \nNice song though
the next song is probably england is my city
England for next single
I thought the title said official video. I was beyond confused for a while.
She's back!!I freaking love this woman
The album art is a mannequin you perverts. Jk... but really, it is.
think this is going to be my favourite album from annie so far
Go to the google search and type: WUMO SEO. Its the most reliable Seo firm. They offer you 100% refund guarantee. I vouch for WUMOSEO.
Unfortunately, I don't think that is Annie's butt.
Way more interesting than New York. The drums, in particular, are great in this. Finally some loud guitar work from Annie!
Where is the electricity? It's not bad, but it's nothing new, especially from her. Hmm.
I absolutely love St. Vincent
Officially the most overrated city on earth.
The instrumentals on this song are so good I'm...wigless
Why is this saying this video is not available????!!!!! Has this happened to anyone else? I love this song 😫😓
This song is about vampiric Hollywood never aging, notice the blood-red backdrop
now, now
Something about this girl....damn
Does the beginning of this song remind anyone else of Stylo by Gorillaz a little bit?
I like the way she builds the song to the final heartbreaking minute. Brilliant. Beautiful.
Dat ass doe.
;-;
Poor lil Annie, what happened
meh
That intro sounds like Stylo
Old Stylo
Sounds awesome.
Reminds me Garbage...
butt
She's channeling GOLDFRAPP
4:16 THAT PART, JESUS
Nice ass.
This sounds exactly like Stylo by Gorillaz
great song
PLS COME TO TORONTO
visit us\nhttps://youtu.be/SGjoJmccpF0
fucking good
Brill = love the riff at 2:26
Sounds somewhere between Goldfrapp and Lady Gaga
so catchy. great singing.
*_Smile)_*
Huey Newton viiiiiiiibessssssss
👀
Im like the two songs so far... people can you please stop complaining about i miss the old... go back to her old stuff.\nShe have to change and do new stuff.
Time to admit she's going full on pop? This sounds like an attempt at chart fodder to me. Ah, for the days of Actor/Strange Mercy.
Her earlier album covers were pictures of her head. Now this album is an ass. Really hope it's not an indicator of the direction her music us taking
this will be Annie's worst album
2:25 was awesome, some of her best vocals yet. The rest was just okay
Cara Delevingne brought me here
Make another Actor
lmao this is absolutely trash, fucking hipster lesbian bitches
This is trash
Wonder woman 2: leaked footage
Finally!!!!!! Awesome tune from fifa17

Wait a minute. She looks like a female version of the karate kid!
Waited almost a year to say this.                                                                                Fifa 17
Boy, that girl sure is strong to carry that boy.
https://youtu.be/Xc3pV_WjM2E самое интересное видео !!!
Was that absinthe??
What is Tupac doing there? 1:56
i cant feel my face when im with you
I guess this is what happens when you win a Grammy? Happened to Arcade Fire too. You write decent music, focused on the melody, then win a Grammy and get VERY commercial in an extremely generic way. Maybe you get to the top and you just don't care anymore? I know he made 'party' music before, so the dance element isn't so far off, but this just seems so blah and uninspired.
I totally relate to the chick with the lamb at 1:57
I really don't mind Beck going with a more Dance vibe for some of this newer material, but his last single Dear Life was making me hope that his new album would go for a more Psychedelic Pop vibe, maybe kinda like an MGMT, Grizzly Bear, Unknown Mortal Orchestra type of thing.
Foster the Kids, is that you?
I thought she was grabbing Beck at first
Sorry, but Disco still sucks.
Slick as always Beck \\m//
B3CK Stingray just replaced Stylo as my favorite music vid car. Gosh damnit I love beck.
Not sure if this is what Beck was going for, but as an alcoholic this hit me in the gut.
FU, I know the cost of that cube.   I know the cost of the commercial grammy you aspire unto.    Regardless, I love you.
Opinions on whether the scene with the furry at 3:10 is a The Shining reference?\nScene here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmOoekbK6YI
Produced and directed by the country of canada, who chose a weird aspect ratio for some reason. What is that, 14:9?
Let me know who is the girl in that video? Is she the death?
Beck in here https://youtu.be/av0umGH6Mn0
Auh
This reminds me of The Weeknd
I always loved Beck for his edgy, weird lyrics. for his genre-breaking and kind of childish-brilliant use of instruments and sounds. But i feel like these times are over now after hearing his new singles. I appreciate everything he does, but i can't get into this song for example, because its just so normal Pop with yeah blabla Up all night with u-romantic lyrics and so on. Times are changing and i feel like the crazy spirit of Odelay, The Information or Midnite Vultures is forever gone.\n(just my opinion - i'm ok with u guys liking it, i mean it's not a bad song at all)
I'm glad Beck comes around every 5 years or so to drop 2-3 fire tracks then disappear until popular music changes again.
i think that the girl is a cocaine line saving to a drunk boy...after that the boy go how we look at the finish
I searched for Jeff Beck and this is the shit I get.

BECK always!!!   always!!
I want that guys jackettttt
Solène Rigot is great !

so good...
Wow! What a brilliant Lovestory!
sounds like Justice music
It's about damn time he released this. Came out over a year ago.
i love this so much.
as soon as i saw presented by CANADA i knew this would be good
Beck is BACK! :D
Ni🅱️🅱️a
Beautiful
heh not too shabby
Needs more washboard solo
Tht is a vry sexy car
If this doesn't top the charts then I don't know what will. his new material has been so fucking catchy and awesome.
Blink 182 XD
I fucking love Beck!! Great single!
I've never heard Beck so blatantly commercial. I actually like it though. He should be a allowed to change like anybody else.
Certain points in the song remind me of Justin Timberlake
I can tell this album will be great
Damn I need a girl in shining armor to come rescue me
i have seen all these same people at the same parties
I Need a Hero 🎼 :v
awesome track, all day long listening on my job
Don't dig this, too radio friendly dance pop for me.
Just in time for the 2018 Grammy nominations, just sayin'  ...
I need me a car/girl like that man.
The content of my day dreams
FINALLY!!! been waiting for the official release of this song, sounds a bit different from the pre release version of this song, not to mention been checking several times a week for the album name release or anything on it
todays music sucks and is fake as fuck
0:33 So you can skip to the song
Eh, Loser is better.
this was one of the hypest thing ever \ni want this to be a movie
HEARD THIS ON FIFA FIRST
SHITS ABOUT TO BLOW UP YO
wtf had no idea this was beck
This already has more views than Dear Life??
this mv is so cool
This was published on my birthday and looks so much like my birthday party :P
Wow, this is absolute rubbish......Whats happened to one of the best ?? That is just commercial drivel......'Tell me thats it's nobodys fault, nobodys fault, but..............
Some fans are going to whine about Beck doing a straight pop record. \n\nI'm excited. This is long overdue. Sounds amazing so far.
Good song, cool video, but what's up with all those washed out Instagram filter colours in modern music videos?
A girl traversing through a party battlefield filled with everything from booze, drugs, orgies and football players just to save her boy. Then it turns out she isn't a she after all, but rather a bitchin' metallic sports car. One of the most unique music videos produced in ages.
I'm so sad I couldn't see him, among other musicians, at the Waterfront Park.
Love you Beck, your music experiments changed my life back in the day here is some of my music: https://soundcloud.com/goldenkey
Meh. I think Beck is long past his best.
I like this, but it doesn't sound like a Beck track- rather a track by somebody else featuring Beck...
Hmm.  License plate of the car says Canada but looks like the California license plate/font.  What is B3CK saying???
I really like how this new upbeat sound functions both as a feel good bop but also a scream into the void
good song but i couldnt think of anything else than i cant feel my face when im with you..
This is basically Dante's Inferno.
Well, it's been a long year waiting for this to come out so I wouldn't have to put FIFA on just to listen to this.
So basically, one of the most original musical voices in the last 30 years was forced to pigeonhole his musical stylings into the worst era of music ever just to make payday. Fucking deplorable. There is NOTHING setting this pablum apart from everything else out there right now. Fucking disgusting. Utterly revolting.
EA bringed a song from the future
I find it ironic how Beck is presently opening for U2. I'm a massive fan of both, but I find the irony in how paranoidly U2 is obsessed w having a radio hit, so much so that they second-guess themselves to the point where it takes them 3 years to finish an album which they said was complete back in 2014, w the lead single being more in the meh category than the sheer song-craft that they're more than capable of, trying to solve the problem by hiring pop-friendly producers. All the while, Beck writes an amazing song like this (as well as the other singles from his forthcoming, HIGHLY anticipated new album), producing it on his own. Yeah, he delayed its release by a year, but he still did all of the songwriting, as well as the bulk of the instrumentation on his own, on top of the production work.\n\nIn short, if U2 still feel like not returning to the powerhouse duo of Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, they should try hiring Beck as their next producer! Or maybe even someone like either Dan Auerbach or Jack White, or even T Bone Burnett!
Beck is a scientologist and therefore an idiot.
I'm in love of Beck in every sense, his voice is so.. i don't know how to describe it but it feels like silver gold
No-one else think it sounds like (a albeit better version) of I can't feel my face when I'm with you?
Did you know you have genes named after Sonic the Hedgehog? \nNEW mini-ep over on my Insta: https://www.instagram.com/sci_phile/ \nThanks for watching! -- KH

hey Kyle Hill! i have a question with regard to Dragon Ball franchise. we see Saiyans going under a transformation and becoming super Saiyans and also Namekians becoming Super Nameks. is this really possible? any organism undergoing a physical transformation and also increasing its physical capabilities in strength, speed, and mental capacity?
Tails is a boy......
What does the fox say?
please dont write with your right hand (assuming that this isn't a mirror image from the camera) anymore, that was painful to watch lol
If the planet is smaller and gravity is different, wouldn't we need to modify the numbers to match that, and wouldn't the air density be different from ours because the planet is smaller?
So what do u do on the weekend, o ya know just managed to put tails on a scale figured out his weight and solved the probability of him truly flying.\n\nWhat I did ate McDonald's and gamed.
How Fast Do Tails’ Tails Gotta Go To Fly? No fast than Sonic's feet. But hey.... That's just a theory! A game theory!
So Tails's ass has exposed bone because with his tails spinning enough they would rip the meat off from around the base of them.
Would a fluffy tail rather than a metal rotor blade create more lift or less?
And how fast would he run if he turned the upward motion in direct forward motion like running? Faster then sonic?
he can't rotqte it really if he doesn't have that special joint...but then there are no muscles that would provide rotation...unless he hasn't some kind of mechanics similar to steam engine...\n\nAlso don't forget the spinning is not enough, he has to keep his tail flat and in right angle, like propellers do
come one, decide, miles per second or meter per second, that's confusing!
That necklace makes it look like you survived an autopsy
how many fans would it take to blow away hurricane Irma.
I dont have twitter so i cant ask there. I was just thinking. How would laser eyes work?
Could this apply to earthworm Jim's head?
@Nerdist  8:27 - or maybe they aren't suppose to twist, maaybe they're using magnus effect?
Dear sir no calculation is every pointless. Lol keep up the great work.
8:23 I was musing that idea the entire video, kinda distracting... disturbing lol
Do a collab with Game Theory!!\n\nLike if u agree
going off what you said about his tails spinning in the spot without twisting up, why do his tails stick out in the same spot while doing a spin dash haha ou would think they would either be curled up with him or spining around his ball body but somehow they come out the back lol
You need to cut the hair cause im paying less attention to the vidoe and just looking at your hair the whole time haha
Could you do an episode about how much force it would take bane to break Batman's spine? I feel like that would be quite a lot of effort.
Hey Kyle I was wondering would it be possible for a human to free fall  from an airplane for example and while he is falling to arrange his  arms in such a way that he creates really high RPM and for the final  meters before he hit the ground to arrange his hands again to create  lift or enough air resistance to cancel out the gravity so he ends up  landing with out getting hurt? (Always assuming that he will not pass  out from spinning and he has something of his hands to increase surface  area a bit)
Would luffys gear third actually make him stronger since hes hitting with a larger surface area but equal mass?
The Butter Zone. Lets make that a thing.
A helicopter spins a 360 propellor however tails uses 2 tails that would cross over so how does he in fact generate a lift with fur??
So about a month ago I was  playing sonic 2 with my nephew and he started laughing when I told him Tails real name. I asked him, what's so funny? he said  it's Miles prower, get it..... Miles per hour, it's cause he's fast too I literally never put that together and my mind was blown... I know, real late to the show.
You kind look like the actor for thor
With KH hair in pig tails, how would the math change? \n(This could be a funny video)
I think you need MatPats pixel measurements for the area of Tails....tails.
Can you guys please do a video analyzing how fast sonic is? Maybe even going off of the comic canon or just the games canon
The way tail's tails could spin without twisting is if once they completed half a rotation they flipped across the axis of rotation to their starting point. Impractical, yes, but so is a fox fliying by it's tails. Heck, so is a fox having two tails period.
What does your poor tails look like a pig? Poor guy
My brain exploded on the first few equations.
There is a cool video on the Gnoggin channel about how tails tails spins like that.\nWorth a watch as a complementary video to this one
Tails' tails couldn't exceed 767 mph +/- as breaking the sound barrier who cause tremendous damage to him. They had this issue when developing the p-51 Mustang. Propellers can only go so fast. Don't think tails can carry sonic
How fast would a human have to run to run across water?
Without the highly unusual axle anatomy, his tails would rotate along their axes as they're spun. The problem is that due to the magnus effect, the resulting lift would actually be in the wrong direction. For him to be able to hover using the magnus effect by spinning his tails, his tails need to be under him, not the other way around.
FFFF- WHY HAVE I NEVER NOTICED THAT PUN???!\nMILES PER HOUR\nMILES PROWER\nIT'S SO F***ING OBVIOUS!\nbrb, questioning everything I know
Tails is not equally iconic as Sonic.  Not a Miles-hater, it's just Sonic is significant more iconic.
What if his tail rotate opposite to each other kind of like a chinook helicopter? That way they don't twist together, or at least that's how I like to think of it in my head...\nWouldn't a rotation like that give him more uplift or would it be the same since the diameter of each tail would be, what I assume would be, half? So many questions about fictional topics, I'm just gonna stop right here .
I'd watch you on ProjectAlpha but that website runs and looks like it was built by a highschooler.
My math teacher is my football coach😂😂
Speaking about the mystery of how Tails' tails can spin the in the first place, have you ever seen this comic strip? http://brawlinthefamily.keenspot.com/comic/title-540/
Question: Where does Venom symbiot recede to when it's not present over the body?
so i have a question\nwhen was the last time tails actually used his tails to fly\nexcluding sonic mania, i cant think of many times tails has flew outside of the classic sonic games
How would the Death Star effect the Galaxy it is in? I mean it's basically a new planet
You think Tails weighs 44 pounds? Isn't he supposed to be a red fox with 2 tails? The average weight of an adult red fox is less than 25 pounds.
kyle.... addressing the issues that keep me up at night.
Don't watch this high. My head hurts lol
I understand why you counted his tails as airfoils, but honestly I was hoping you found/did the math to find that horrible equation.
Tail's tails don't twist because they rotate on different orientations to compensate for the torque produced by the rotation of each tail. Similar to how helicopters have a blade on the back to counter the torque produced by the main rotor. If they didn't even if he had a free rotating tail bone he would spin out of control.
How fast do Tail's tails go to let him move as fast as Sonic?
Did you remember to take into account air pressure?
[HEY KYLE BIG FAN\n\nI WAS CURIOUS AS TO HOW TIME RATIO WORKS IN GAMING \nGAMES THAT ARE OPEN WORLD AND ACCELERATE TIME TO GROW CROPS, FIGHT MONSTERS, OPEN SHOPS, SPEAK TO NPC's\nEct.

But what about Dragons? How do they fly?
Kyle's hair is longer than my lifespan
I just realized that he has a real challenge writing on that glass for the camera.
Videos like these make me wonder if Matpat and Kyle are friends, or should be friends.
What is Tails name in the German version of the game? ˆˆjust curiose XD
Thanks for all the awesome Because Science w/ Kyle videos. PLEASE PLEASE help me out, i'm looking for the background music for all these videos, both the ones at beginning/end, and especially the one in the middle.
I can't be the only one who noticed but at 4:17 if u pay close attention you can see 2 pacs name
Anybody remembered game theory about street fighters move ?
Maybe the twist issue is solved by fourth dimensional tails
Dear Kyle i am a huge fan of because science ive binge watched all tgey episodes and so far my favorite has been the xenomorph life cycle i dont know if i spelled any of that right but i tried anyway i want to know if the nervegear from sword art online possible the way its desribe or just possible at all or at the very least could it be possible and please dont forget  the amosphier headgear and the full dive gear found at the end of Sword Art Online2 and this is a fair warning this comment will show up on every video uploaded from hear on out until i see saif episode please do so and thank you
Kyle, you missed something. All your equations work only if Tails' tails are shaped somewhat like helecopter rotor blades. The problem is that the tails are shaped absolutely nothing like rotor blades.
The Mammalian equivalent to the Hummingbird and/or Flying Insects
this whole video went over my head. *leaves unsatisfied*
Awesome Video, I do have an interesting  idea for a because science what would happen if a light saber crossed paths with the energy sword from Halo franchise
}8^O them hidden spikes'll get u every time
The thing I want to know is how tails' tails spin without getting entangled. Does he have a special rotor disc, that he keeps is 2 tails straight, while the rotor disc does all the spinning.
I like your video they are so funny
Making pointless calculation was my pass time. Because science
550 revolutions per minute? Sounds more like a history lesson if you ask me
If the tails are normal (not flat) the tails could roll as they spin, providing consistent lift and a plausible spin mechanism. On the other hand, is it possible to create lift from a propeller lacking a flat, canted surface?
Next can you do how does the ground pound in mario 64 save you from fall damage
I would like to see an episode for how hulk can increase his mass in order to transform
Any idea of how Tracer's chrono accelerator is working?
So how does tails maneuver without a tail rotor no pun intended.......... or was there.....
when he was mentioning speed did anyone notice he said miles prower and not miles per hour

Plz
Puede wal-e impulsarse en el espacio con un extintor ? La fisica lo permite ?
I had a problem at first with assuming that the coefficient of lift of his tails were equal to an extremely engineered helicopter blade, but then I realized that these guys were genetically engineered! If his tail is engineered with that freely rotating tailbone joint then his tails were likely also engineered with that shaped. \n\nThe fur might even help to smooth out the airflow, though it'd be hard to get it into a wing shape at those speeds. Probably has some feather-like hardened fur at the bottom to flatten out the bottom edge. Wouldn't be noticeable when not in use because the fluffiness of his tail hides it.
James, you came from another galactic
0:00 seconds into the song I like it already
He makes me feel like I belong. I have always believed I was different and I allowed myself to get bullied. Now I have the most amazing and understanding friends. Now I know what it feels like to love. His voice helps me know that it will be okay and I feel wanted know love you and your going places. 😉👌👍 ❤️ ❤️ ❤️

Great. Feeling this soul.
Ahhhh ❤ Br ❤
Какая же обалденная песня! просто чума! но клип конечно нужно другой снять, такой стильный, дорогой с красивой девочкой и обязательно с ночной Калифорнией и тогда будет просто ммм
Hes so amazing yet an underrated singer, people need to learn good taste in music.
Why is James Blunt going the Ed Sheeran route. He was far better singing those soulful songs earlier. Not saying his music should not evolve, but he sounding too pop now.
2:37 best change of rhythm..  perfect song, goosebumbs all over the place! xx
His Voice are so beautiful and no one can sing better Than him :)
📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃\n*MY LIKE FOR WONDERFUL VIDEO*\n📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃📃
THAT New Retro Wave sound! YES!
This is what u call voice of music......I love his music
I can only describe his voice as... ethereal. Just amazing. It seems his voice is suited for any genre, and I find it crazy. Not many artists can transition like that and still have it sound natural as if they were made for it, you know?
Awesome song and voice, but it makes me sad. Can't afford her? 😕😢
Hi James big up from Algeria!! 😘😘
Oooooh myyy!!!!!!!! \n\nI love ur music so.. Thank you from Czech Rep. I will be glad if You visit us!!!! But I will buy ur next album again - be chill. :) \n\nI hope you have a very nice days. So lot of healthy, of energy, of positive, of money, of LOVE I wish to you! :)

Bill totally looks like a lesbian.
How is that scary lol.it must be opposite day.
Why didn't they show what he looked like smiling as IT too?
He did good scared me
So Pennywise got inspiration of Floki's laugh lol
I’m so horny right now
he looks like a finnick odair with steve buscemi's eyes and face structure
Body Language Analysis No. 4061: Pennywise,IT, and Bill Skarsgård's Demonic Smile - Why is IT so Scary? - Nonverbal and Emotional Intelligence\nhttp://www.bodylanguagesuccess.com/2017/09/body-language-analysis-no-4061.html
His hand is bigger than his face. Not in the bad way though.
I think he would play a really good joker in the new joker origins movie
Its his eyes. BIG ROUND EYES.
Im not real enough for you billy?
i knew he looked a little familiar :)
I want to have his children.
Should be the next meme .
I've never heard of him.
I AM THE GREAT JURRIGAN! I NEED T.P. FOR MY BUNGHOLE!!
Probably because he eats a lot of surstromming
He would make a great jack the ripper.
His smile looks a cross between Steve Buscemi and William Dafoe
I know a lot of people want him as Joker, me included. But he does not need makeup to be creepy the way he can contort his expressions and he has that killer laugh and gaze. He may be the Riddler we have been waiting for.
The first pennywise was so much more scary and real. This one was more modern and computerized. The movie was great, but the first pennywise was much more thrilling.
When I saw that smile I automatically got flashbacks
He may be scarey with the mask but under the mask hes really cute.. He must have alot of girl fans..
Conan i bet if these clips were longer more people would watch them
Can't get over how much he sounds like Alex! Gorgeous family.
he's so cute haha and he doesn't mind to look funny <3
His smile somehow remind me of Black Hole Sun-Soundgarden video
that boi got a 4x4 on his head 😂😭💀
I didnt know smiling like that was rare. The curl lip smile. I thought everybody could do thst
Please give him the Joker in Scorcese's origin film
this guy looks like hillary clinton
Who else tried to mimic the smile?
cant wait for part2 of IT
He can play the joker
if they have plan to make The Killing Joke live action movie adaption, I recommend him....
Who else thought it was Harry Styles by the thumbnail? 😱
Conan: How's your brother now?\nMe: Better than Georgie
He is the joker that i want, dc and wb take a note.
Every time I came back here, it gets more and more views
I seriously cannot think of a better actor to reprise the role of Pennywise! Bill deserves all the praise and glorification that follows him from this. Cheers to Bill for putting horror movies on top once again!
Conan tried to do it 😂
He looks like he would be great to play as Norman Osborn in Spider-man with that smile. 0:53.
conan is a weird looking mf
if the photographer asks you to smile for your ID picture, just smile like that.
He did an amazing job as it 🎬👍
LADIES AND GENTLEMAN, OUR NEW JOKER!
He's a male counterpart of Cara Delavigne
Lemme guess, this guy as the next joker
Looks like a young Steve Buscemi.
He better be the next Joker
IT was the worst Horror movie I've seen in two years...
I hope he's  the next joker
I'm so happy Bill is getting the recognition he deserves!! He was soooo good as Roman in Hemlock Grove...I'm still pissed that show got canceled -_-
take a look at our lastest challenge video we get slapped hard on our backs xD\nyou wont be disapointed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvJlS5QMtqY&feature=youtu.be
To me he kinda looks like young Tim Curry.
I miss Jay Leno.\nAt least he was funny.
He is Floky from Vikings brother for those who were wondering. Imagine how crazy Floky was, crazy is in their Gene pool.
Hey can I get 500 new subscribers ❤️❤️
His eye is naturally fucked, thought it was cgi
#2 on trending. I kidnap a man and it only gets 600 views
i love him! he so gorgeous😍😍
I can't be the only one that sees that smile as more goofy than demonic.
Alright. None of that.
Baby Buscemi

Creepy little bastard
Pedophile face
Joker...
hahahaha he was inadvertedly cosplaying The Great Cornholio!
Steve Buscemi has grown 10 inches  taller ?
Starts at around 0:49
Lol I think it's oddly adorable 😂😂
Steve Buscemi's son

The clown lowkey looks like Jimmy Neutron after smoking marijuana
Nobody is saying that Africans in Africa will ever be a minority\nNobody is saying that Asians in Asia will ever be a minority.\nSo why are they saying Whites will be a minority in Britain in 2032?\nAnd Sweden in 2028?\nThat’s because there’s MASSIVE non-White immigration in EVERY White country and ONLY White countries.\nBecause there’s a program of White geNOcide.
0:52 When you are ready to rape
He looks like Harry Styles and Steve Buscemi had a baby
He's such an amazing actor He killed It in It No pun intended 🤣😁
Very Creepy

We love u Logan don't ever forget that 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍\n\nPs:I have all the maverick merch even that one
You are a creative man, how beautiful you are thank you
I love that YouTube letter...it is a well thought out and written letter...I thought it is going to some normal boring letter but I was so nice...
Who's this kid? Pretty funny.
He said every day bro f#€$ Jake Paul
I am a homeless veteran and I was wondering if anyone could loan me ten thousand dollars and I could pay you back in a year guaranteed.  It would be highly appreciated. Please and thank you.
People hating on Logan Paul cuz he has 10 million more subscribers than the them... smh
tell evan to not be a dick on a vlog plz it will make me so so so so happy
You really are a fucking douchebag tho... How can you not realize that.
Honestly Logan and his Brother should've died with VINE
Logan's fan base is worse than PewDiePie's fanbase that's consisting of childs only.
ALogan Jake did you get first he did it in 370 day 17 days and put back together 317 and you did it in 340 so Jake actually get it before you
Yeah he changed YouTube by making it a shit show
show it to jake and make him buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurn\n\n\n\n\nhe'll say HELP ME
You didnt change shit, you used a platform in a way that you were more advantageous. It wasnt impressive, it was bought through bullshit culture in which you garner the following of kids
Logan is a douche, but I like Logan. Idk y, he's just kinda like able. Unlike his brother, I hate his brother so much.
Wait so do people hate this guy like they hate his brother? I'm confused honestly, he seems cool
I've never watched this channle and its..........interesting 😐
Why is this untalented piece of shit trending
That Dwarf is crazy
Anyone know that song that was played when Logan called Evan a piece of shit?
Logan is my inspiration as well as many others for creating YouTube channels! I hope he gets to 50 million in 2 years like he said! I take logan over pewds any day although I do like pewdepie as well not hatin or anything lol
why is this idiot ranked no4
You don't deserve that
Ha ha the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life
What a click bait title
You don't deserve that
What change??? You made no changes??? Only made the platform more cancerous :/
Hope you get cancer x
How Logan Paul changed YouTube forever *Autistic yelling every 5 seconds of the video*
This guy is so full of himself...
Honestly , Logan Paul is A LOT better then Jake & he deserves it A LOT more then Jake lol
He's just another annoying PewDiePie/Toby alleged rapist Turner/Damn Daniel, douchebag.
*You sure did change YouTube, you made it shit*
you dont do shit all you do is vlog your life which isnt all that interesting and overcharge people for some crappy merch
*I feel bad for the people living under you*
the only way you changed youtube is for the worse including your dick chin brother
You didn't change YouTube for shit dawg.
Im not a big fan but I do enjoy seeing his daily stuff he puts out everyday...congrats on 10M subscribers
You didn't change anything
I was on YouTube longer than him I also make cringy videos were the heck are my subs? XD
Good to see you got your silver play button, not sure if you deserve it though...
How Logan Paul Changed YouTube\n\nBy smashing expensive shit...okay

Holy shit that thumbnail. White dad,  black mom, mixed baby, and THE FUCKING REDDIT SNOO. This is so unironic it's funny. To top of off it's #1 on trending on Youtube. My sides are non existant.
I DONT KNOW WHY MY ASS IS CRYING
Jesus christ the US trending page is absolute garbage. Congrats though.
It's funny how because Sarina is famous and has money, her getting pregnant out of wedlock is totally ok for the Jehovah's Witness leaders, but if a regular member of the organization did the same they would be excommunicated and have all their friends and family taken away from them.  Definitely not a cult.
I am a homeless veteran and I was wondering if anyone could loan me ten thousand dollars and I could pay you back in a year guaranteed.  It would be highly appreciated. Please and thank you.
Your wife is literally a man. She looks like a fucking man, a gorilla!

Where's iPhone 9? Just skips to iPhone x. Lol okay nice math there Apple
iPhone X or 10 looks amazing, looking forward to get that. But I'm not really amazed by the iPhone 8 even though I have an iPhone 6+
Can you call me when you put some actual NEW tech in your next iPhone? Like the last iPhone that had some serious invocation was iPhone 6, with it 3D Touch. But since then all they done was, upgrade screen/processor/camera, all that stuff... yeah sure faceid bla bla bla, that's just a program, that can actually be applied to any fucking camera, not just iPhone 8 camera
The iPhone is hurting to the 8th level now
i love seeing android users seethe in the comments djdjddj

Face recognision was already made by Asus laptop 😂😂😂 last 2011
Iphone X will allow police to open your iPhone by only holding in front of your face! Its made to help the police. Also, if sleeping, anyone in your house can open your phone the same way. Also the TSA...and so on.

Over here in -Buttfuckistan- Poland it's actually around $1400 (4979 PLN), which is IIRC more than 3/4ths of the workers of the country earn in a month. \n\n10/10 best phone.
But... How do you view all your open apps now?
You think 1000$ is expensive ?\nIn my country it's 1200$ \nThanks apple
The bad: apple is stubborn. They tend to limit functionality in the name of driving you to pay money for their monopolized services. \n\nThe good: iPhones are seamless experiences. I could go all day on the amount of shit I had trouble with on my galaxy 8 but I don't wanna write millions of paragraphs. iOS just is far more seamless in the voip, app, and notification experience.
My flip phone still works just fine though
Why are people keep bashing the animojis? It's just a cool fun harmless little feature like Photo Booth in Mac. Steve Jobs did a funny demo for Photo Booth before too.
Even Pewdiepie is coming up with fresher ideas than Apple.
Tbh I actually kinda like te iPhone X\nBut it only got 2 new features and those are emoji and face lock. Othe things like removing home button thing just got upgraded.\nI wanted something like projector or like you can make the phone like a tablet when you want to watch a movie or something.\nI expected these from iPhone 10 and it's already maded ........\nOh I'm disappointed
http://jacksfilmsisgay.weebly.com/\nhey jack i made a website for you\n(i didnt use fucking squarespace you prick)
Omg jack I heard this in the radio this morning and I knew this was you
I want the juthith! You can't handle the juthith!
Where's the lie?
Now stealing identities is going to be a lot easy for me, thanks to useless face scans and probably keeping records without us know
I paid $999 for features but a jack ain't one
Jacksfilms in the german trends :')\nSo hot right now
YES TRENDING HERE WHERE I LIVE
After watching this video 10 minutes after the orginal teaser I thought to myself ima swtich back to apple but this video did show me how eventually it's too pricey and sooner or later other competitiors will adapt to have these functions....animoji tho lol
Apple went from creating advanced technology, to just making an extremely advanced camera...it's stupid
Apple is the best. Deal with it
1:45\nTechnically you can get an old working but in a bad shape Kia spectra for less then a 100 dollars soo I can’t see the point if comparing the price (JK)
The scroll down joke was hilarious  ....
I JUST REALIZED THIS PHONE IS $1000. \nOH HIIIIEEEELLLLLLL NAAAAWW
God damn that was funny 😭
Samsung Note 8 is 960+ dollars. And it's almost identical to the S8 Plus except the stylus and the dual camera. Yet you haters turn a blind eye on that 😂
$1,000 for something you'll probably drop in the toilet and have to kill it with fire. Or sell it on eBay and fail to disclose it's water adventure.
Jack, you forgot to mention the wireless charging! Tots Apple idea!
Steve Jobs wakes up from coffin, just can't stand the stupidity.
So, when i wear face paint on halloween, how am I supposed to use my phone?
People are still gullible enough to buy it.
I'm fucking pissed that they removed the dongle.
If steve jobs were still alive, he would make iphone that can turn into ipad, iwatch and TV.
I think they got the animated emoji thing from the end of the emoji movie where they send the emoji with many emotions and the guy doesn't delete his phone.  Can sony sue Apple plz?
NSA, FBI, and CIA: alright apple. We have everyone's fingerprint but noone is using the face feature. We need all their faces now to put it into our system..\n\nCook: No problem!
Thank you for your life juice
The iPhone 8 is literally the iPhone 7s with a fake tinder profile.... #catfish
That moment when James Gunn liked your video, congrats Jack!
did anyone notice the poop emoji from the best sony motion picture Emoji movie in the corner there (on the thumbnail)
You can't        afford it
Check out my iPhone X parody on my channel too! :D
The next step in innovation is a self awareness meter, and if the meter is empty the phone self destructs.
The Blackberry Z line didn't die for this!\n\n(had the swipe up to go home for a good few years, and I'm fairly sure others did too)\n\nBTW, any good phone suggestions that aren't Apple or Andriod? (the entire concept. fuck android. even the creator hates its guts and apologized for the cancer he infected the world with)\nAlso something besides the OnePlus just in case...
I honestly think this is the best apple has done with the iphone in a few years
Jack you were.on Dutch television with this. On a show called RTL boulevard with a piece about the iphone X. They used some clips from your video to show how stupid the cost is
Apple can take a massive shit on-stage during the next event and charge people $1,000 for a spoonful, and people will still buy it.
If its security you want, there is none, remember NSA has all ..sees all..Snowdon warned you, zero security! This is a test to see how many dummies will pay any price to be spied on ! And add some more slaves to Apple ! Yep !
*LOVE IT, so true, lol! Can't afford it!*
Iphone 6s and 6s plus was the last Iphone with a real upgrade.
The phone is too fkin expensive..
the poor poor iPhone 9 will never exist. I cri evertim
The worst part is that everything he said is true 😂😂
No sponsor? Even on a skit? Where's the real jack
Great, an overpriced, low end piece of junk that's literally a clone of every android ever, except with a shittier screen. My Mother's $200 motorolla has no buttons on the front and is far better in terms of functionality and hardware. Why must they pretend that they are ahead of the game when android always releases this stuff before them? Except for the privacy red flag face storing software BS. This already sounds like something out of a dystopian novel. What's next? Shoving a cable into your cerebellum and downloading your memory to the cloud? Matrix here we come!
The iPhone X\nBecause nobody makes a version 9 of anything anymore.\n\nSee, even Microsoft did it with Windows 10 ...... *NO! WE REVOLUTIONIZED IT!!*  Nobody has done the *X* before!  Nobody, not even XBOX......  fuck.
1. Take picture of person with phones face \n\n2. Show the iPhone X the pic\n\n3. Free phone
White girl's phone, apple is for them white girls, get their daddy to buy them a new Volkswagen and they go to Starbucks wearing addidas all-stars
They just released two knew colors \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*SO*\n\nAnd\n\n*TRUE*
This is on the radio oh my god
You should’ve took an extra day to make this video to come up with better examples.. this was kindve a crap video
Hey jack le debile, et la parody Android elle est où ? Encore un gamin jaloux aveuglé par ça fierté ... et du con faut peut être grandir un jour ? 😂😂😂
#icansaynigger
More like IFhone eXpensive.....
So with the new Face ID thing now you can take someones phone and scan their face while they're sleeping to gain access to everything.
The X is a secret message from the good guys at Apple saying DONT BUY THIS ❌❌❌
Why did I think he was making fun of what the next iPhone will look like.\n\n\nWell I just saw the trending page and.. my life juice is being sucked out.
Haven't laughed so hard in ages!
So now every twin will bypass face id and use their sibling's iPhone?
😂 This is Funny, you know what's funnier? I'll be buying it 😂😂😂👻
This would be 1000 times better if he didn't cuss
Why isn't this #3 on trending?
Arguably the scariest magical item of the your universe, a  cell phone feeds upon human happiness and leaves its victim in a state of depression and despair. The Dark creature's ultimate weapon is called the Wifi, which it gives when it removes its cloak, clamps its jaw around a victim's mouth, and sucks out his or her soul. This fate is often considered worse than death. The Wifi leaves the person in a persistent vegetative state, and a person in this condition does not have the option of becoming a ghost, since a person's soul must be in tact to roam the earth.
I wonder if this meets Jim's bowl criteria dyiiiing! Hahaha
Hope your ankles better soon, loved this vlog❤️❤️
The book you held up, Conversations with Friends, is currently on my bedside table. I am just getting into reading it! I bought it in Paris when on a girls vacation with my best friend. Tanya, I hope you enjoy reading it when you get time 😄
I'm already getting excited for Vlogmas. Am I the only one? The shopping in the beginning just gave me the Vlogmas vibe :D
How she wears a dress with a trainers 💓 yeees Tan !
Aww loved this video Tanya! You look stunning in this video
Oh my goodness where did you get your sunglasses, they are the exact pair I've been looking for??!
Where did they go for breakfast? Looks stunning!
Does anyone know if Tan's lips are naturally that size or if she has lip injections/something like that?  She has the most beautiful lips and they look extremely natural.
Does anyone know where Tanya's pyjamas are from?
oh my goodness - seeing a meet and greet like that shows how exhausting it must be! and on a twisted ankle too! you are awesome, tan <3
I love Kate's outfit! Does anyone know where her coat is from? :) x
Where are your sunglasses from😍
Coach nude patent loafers would have been comfortable and looked great with your dress.
Oh wow! It's so weird seeing the meet n greet in fast forward!!
Tanya, for what it's worth, I think it worked out better that you had to wear your trainers, especially when it came to taking photos with everyone. That SAME thing has happened to me in high heels and, oh my gosh, the pain was terrible! I actually relived it watching this. In fact, I had to look away when you showed the photo when it happened. Glad you're ok!
Hi Tanya, I'm also an EGYPTIAN and I watch basically ALL of your videos! I'm a huge fan!💕
I can't wait for your Christmas Vlogs!!!!!!!
Don't you just love when people have actual meaningful conversations with you?!?! I think It's the best, love meeting new people.
Hi Tan! Loved your vlog as per! Bit random but I wanted to make a recommendation for shallower bowls if you're still looking for them lol, Sophie Conran has the most beautiful wider, shallower white ridged bowls that are fab for stir fries & pasta etc. Zoë x
Love that red dress. I felt your pain when you fell. I've sprained my ankle twice and it's not fun. Glad yours wasn't that bad
So amazing to see you loving  my national clothing brand 💓
I love your vlogs so much 💜
that must of hurt!
I love all the reserved pieces you picked out! Great vlog <3
Love youre vlogs specaily when there long! So sad for youre enkel but i hope it feels fine soon!:) And i can't wait till vlogmastime this year❤️🎄 And i am watching youre old vlogmas back so cozy^^ xxx
Where is she at the beginning of the video? :)
Bowl recommendation - look at the brand broste Copenhagen. I think it's what Jim is on about.
you looked amazing in this red dress! also, i need to visit the shop and get the leather jacket cause this is EXACTLY what i've been looking for
I knew I recognised you the other day on Goodge street! I saw myself at 7:43 in the video in the blue jacket and grey trousers walking the opposite direction to you lol
You are such a lady! The fall looked so painful but you didn't moan and groan about it and went on with what you had to do, which also looked painful because you had to remain standing. Chapeau bas!
I'm literally watching this while eating noodles from the type of bowl you are looking for.
does anyone know where tanya's sunglasses are from at 4:00?
YOU MASHED YOUR PEAS??? I've literally never thought of doing that, I'm shoooook 😍😋
Love you and your vlogs!! i've just met you today on broadway in NYC! outside of the converse store! thanks so much for stopping to take a photo with me, you're so sweet!
Your vlogs always make me feel so cosy! Youve always been my favourite vlogger and I cannot wait for your vlogmas!! Xx
Oh god I hope your ankle gets better Tanya. How do you pull off any outfit look hun? lol :) Your makeup looks stunning in this video. Literally cant wait for your book signing next month!! :) x
Hi from Egyptian girl here 🤗😊
I actually love watching your vlogs! I love how chill they are👌🏼
I tore my ligaments and couldn't walk for 6 months witgout support and physio therapy from falling like this. So it is a big deal and im glad u didnt badly hurt yourself. Becareful and hope you feel better. P.S. your edit looks amazing
I live in Cornwall !!!!!
these are the bowls that you need I think!!! http://www.portmeirion.co.uk/sophie-conran-for-portmeirion-white-pasta-bowls-set-of-4.html
Those sunglasses are so beautiful and flattering on you! They seem so expensive though
Your so pretty , I love your makeup xx
Probably a sprain, so if it's really swollen and bruised wrap it and it'll be better in and week or two
What Jim wants is a pasta or salad bowl, which both have low sides: http://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/food-drink/best-pasta-bowl-marks-and-spencer-habitat-denby-royal-doulton-a7043676.html
I love the lip color you're wearing, what is it please?
What was the mac lipstick colour you where wearing at the event? I NEED!💗
Hope your foot is feeling better! You look stunning nonetheless💖
Also, it's a shame you didn't have some converse with you, I think that would have looked really swish
I don't get y you guys buy plants and let them die.. please don't buy them if you're gonna kill them anyway
love your dress! sorry your ankle got hurt
Going to Reserved  tomorrow!
sunglasses!!!
Your eye makeup😍😍
Love the red planter!
I love this 💛
Ouch! I bet your ankle hurt soo much xx
I love u so much xxx I love ur long vlogs like this 😘💗
where is your footstool from im looking for the perfect sized one for my house & this look lovely xx
Your makeup is amazing !!👌🏻🔥Love your products and Zoe's !!
Loved meeting you! But really sad I'm not in the Vlog 😩 but it was lovely and hope you're feeling better!
Those bowls you can find in Tesco now 👍🏻
Hope your ankle is doing better! I sprained mine a few months back and definitely could not have done what you did. I couldn't even put my foot flat down on the floor for nearly a month! You go girl!
I believe what Jim might be looking for is like a spaghetti plate/dish, they're shallow but larger bowls and are super handy, but always missing from sets of dishes.
No your not zoomed it it looks fine :) :) :) ❤️💕❤️💕
Ouch... totally understand the pain for the ankle, I did the same in a Badmington game I was having... Did a smash but smashed my ankle ^^ Put some ice and rest it, should be back on top in a week or so ;) \nBeautiful dress !! Love you Gorgeous xxx
really love your make up! watching your channel, I find very soothing and calming. Your warmth speaks through. XOXO
Omg!! I died a little looking at the pic 😭of your ankle seriously so painful but thank goodness you did not break it.🙌🏻 Also I ordered your new book I can't wait, hopefully the shipping to the US doesn't take forever. Have a lovely day 😊
Hey Tanya love the red dress just wondering what the lipstick you are using
a good looking meal at the end :P
You could see that fall coming as it looked like you were struggling to walk in those shoes!
Omg where are Tan's pjs from!? I love them😍
Where are those sunnies from? Xx
havent watched the full video yet... but bowls.... Le Creuset Coupe Pasta Bowls are my favourite for most meals...
LOVE YOUR PYJAMAS!!!! where are they from?
Ooh I really hope your ankle is getting better! :o ♥ Those sprains (if that's what it was) can hurt like hell....
You're so pretty! Also, I've almost gone through all of your vlogmaxes!
Love your make up ! Please can we have a tutorial on this look 🤞🏼
Please check out my first video with me in it and subscribe if you like me 😂 😇
You are so so amazing 💗💗💗
hey tan, you probably wont read this but my ankle does that all the time! i know the pain. love ya xx
TAN YOU DID NOT WALK AROUND ALL DAY WITHOUT SOCKS ON NO WAY
Loved your dress and makeup but those shoes..sure are pretty but didn't look comfortable!!  I am a nurse and i would have advised you to rest so you did the right thing, glad to see you were not limping too badly.  Thank you for sharing your day and i hope your ankle feels better soon.
I broke my ankle just like that 8 years ago, I was waiting for the train and I suddenly fainted and i could felt the pain straight away  :( you were lucky not to break it
Yay for Reserved in London! I definately one of my very top favourite shops. Tanya looks so beautiful in that dress! But as soon as I saw those shoes, I thought gosh, those heels look dangerous! Poor Tan.
tell Kate my friends all say I'm an aggressive typer as well!
I'm sorry, you don't scream and shout when you break your ankle!!! As a person whose mom recently broke her ankle so badly she had to have an operation I can confirm some people definitely scream and shout when they break their ankle 😂😂
That injury looked so awful, sorry you had a spill like that. Love your videos, you and Jim are my fave, hello from your biggest American fan!
Thanks for bringing so much joy to my life, Tan!
Loved your dress in this! You'll definitely have to be careful on that ankle now. As someone who's went over on their ankle a thousand times 😂 once you've gone over it once there will usually be a bit of weakness in that ankle. This making you more likely to go over it again so be careful especially if you wear heels 😊
Tan, you're such a hard worker! Even though you've hurted your ankle you just suck it up, amazing! Hope your ankle is better now!
AWW ily Tan xx
Does anyone know what lipstick Tanya's wearing? ^^ absolutely gorgeous look.
SO BEAUTIFUL! 😍😭🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺

where is moo  moo ???
I wonder if Tanya would ever like my magic...
Taaaaanya I have that book Get your sh*t together and is worthy. Stay safe dear
you lost weight Tanya, whats your secret?!
How do I pronounce the name of Kauai island? I pronounce it KAWAII island.
You should go to samoa
At 12:22 the urchin his left hand here in Hawaii they're expensive if they're big and we eat them! They're really good by the way🍣
This is so cool I like when you do this is entertainment you should get more subscribers
I'm in Maui
I'm in Maui right now:)
This has got to be one of my fav youtube chanels of all time it would be a dream to go out with these guys on an adventure
The beyond the tide intro to me is a little bit.......
coyote were did u get your hat?
What are you plans if you reach 10mil subs Coyote?
Bro I live on Kauai and secret beach is a new naked beach
Be brave, stay urchin. And we'll see you in the next adventure!
keep an odd amount of likes for coyote
I ate sea urchin a few summers ago while on vacation in California. Had a very good taste like a creamier crab meat salad sort of.
LOL coyote had no idea what kind of shrimp that was and the camera man was spot on when he said it was a coral shrimp and coyote completely ignored him hahahahaha
i live there and the best thing to do is pee on the spikes that go in your hands
My mum stepped on a see urchin when she was a kid and she still have a piece in here foot
Get punched by a mantis shrimp as your ultimate challenge.
HOW MAJESTIC DOES THAT PLACE LOOK!!!!
You need glove I thank for you to hold it
I live on KAUAI🌴
always loved learning about ocean life...i was gonna be a marine biologist...marine invertebrates are so interesting...so many kinds.
When I think of Island I think of a remote Island with a crash site on it and having to survive with a storm on the way
he got spiked it doesnt hurt that much it feels like a bee sting\ni roll on the floor and try to stay alive when i get a bee sting
music is a little distracting.  Might be an idea to turn it down just a tiny bit, could barely hear Coyote over it, especially at the 15 minute mark.
I have eaten sea urchin on several occasions, and, to date, have no crabs in my butt... at least I hope not...
I catched one once in a big beach pool
i wish i lived near. some of the tour destinations. the closest one is atlanta
Before I saw this video I caught a sea urchin it spiked my dad
I GO TO THE HIGHSCHOOL THAT COYOTE PETERSON WENT TO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hey Coyote can you do a bit on huntsman spiders? Perhaps get bit by one?
growing up on oahu i've stepped on vana so many times, it's not as bad as you think
Aahaaaaahahahaha!! On one of your videos I commented you should do this video and you did!!! Too bad I live on the wrong island of the 8 😂
Coyote should have billions of dollars . Amazing that he is not that scared ! If I saw some of those species , I would be like :  Oh hell no!
I wish to see a video of a person hitting a live sea urchin with a hammer
Can you get stung by things
9:48-10:00 isn't that where u jumped and fell off of a little cliff thing
no lie, when he found the shrimp and caught it I got a red lobster ad featuring shrimp, lmao
It's called Uni in Japanese, and served in sushi restaurants. I had it once. ONCE!\nBTW: The edible part is the gonads if it weren't gross enough already.
Come to the big island
Here is how to troll someone \n\n\nRead more
Can you please do another tide pool one. Who agrees
Did you say a squimp?
Wow this channel has grown so much!! Brave Wilderness reached 8 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS!! I remember when they still had around 600,000 subs
Wait so is coyote Peterson a vegetarian or vegan
1:27 Adventure time? Pretty sure that's already in a TV show.
#7 on trending! That's amazing!
Plus 1mil subs in a day?? Holy crap. Well deserved!
I live on the big island you have to piss/pee on it no joke 🍆\n                                                                                                          💦
It's adventure time
Who stuck a crab up your butt? Other person: Wait What?
hey coyote I live near the coast and am Native American part of the kashia band of Pomo Indians and loved seeing the sea urchin I just wanted to say the urchins hear r dark purple and are easy to handle plus yummy and edible as soon as you catch one btw I live in America and usually go to bodega bay and a lot other
go To AUSTRALIA!! Seriously Australia has some of the most unique and interesting animals in the world :P\n\nLove You Brave Wilderness <3 <3
BORING!!! Come to Australia!!! There's plenty of things to sting you 😉
How would like a crab stuck in your butt Coyote Peterson 2K17
I live in Hawaii but im in texas for the army and i  going to hnoululu next monday
I'm not surprised to hear that urchin eats through rock. I've had several urchins in my tank and they straight-up eat coral, including the calcium skeleton.
IF YOU FOUND ALL ANIMALS WHAT WILL YOU DO FOR VIDIOS
Coyote: *gets head eaten off*\nCamera guy: Did it get you?...\nMe: seroiusly.....😑😐😶😂
I live in Hawaii
Hey coyote I got the book that I preordered of yours
They need to make a Netflix show.
That island is so kawaii!! (heh get it? Cause its Kauia, sounds like kawaii.. hehe...( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Coyote's real name is Nathaniel or Nate !
Bit misleading, Kauai is actually greatly populated in most areas, also Jesus wth you doing wearing pants\n\nEdit: sea urchin are really common, they can be found at any beach in Hawaii actually.
Who else wants to hang out with this guy
I remember i went on a cruise around New Caledonia and i went on a beach on mystery island, and Sea Cucumbers were scattered EVERYWHERE!
What exactly is a sea urchin?
You are really Brave
8 MILLLIOOOOOOOOOON

My name is Coyote Peterson, and I am the craziest animal expert alive. To the outside world, I'm an ordinary youtuber, but with the help of my camera crew, I catch insane animal species and get bitten or stung by the most painful species and I am the only one capable of doing this....I am the EXPERT!
Coyote: It's about 7:30  Me: Dang it! I woke up at 8:45!
-w-h-a-t-s- -u-p- -g-u-y-s-
you are cool
Congrats on 8 mil subs👏👏👏

IPhone Xpensive
It looks so fragile i feel like if u put it down on the counter it'll break
Apple died with Steve Jobs...
why the top of the iphone look like it has a reciting  hairline
Um it's not bad but at least it has of what I hope is a headphone plugin
I mean the features are good but honestly I’m not gonna get it
I heard that iPhone release 8 very soon, but now watch iPhone X. What's going on?
Eventually phones will cost more than $1,000.
make sure to keep your eyes closed if someone swipes your phone and tries to scan your face... Lol
Wow Samsung has a new phone
iphone6s+ is th same price as iphone7
with all this screen and no button they *still* got rid of the headphone jack
It looks like other cheaper  big screen phone as Samsung with bunch of useless functions
yo fam can I copy off of you?\nsure but change it a bit so its not suspicious\nok got it\n*one year later*\nIntroducing the new Iphone 8
The only thing I like about the new iPhone X is the new gesture based UI like in the old days of webOS, Nokia Swipe UI and of course BB OS10.
didn't any one noticed that face I'd is the  same iris scanner of Samsung  . that's it will not open if your eyes closed  otherwise it will not be so strong
Did he just say CHEAP?! 2:49
Lol, what kind of samsung is this?
I sense a failure in the X.
Is this a try not to laugh challenge?
also looks like s8.. just .. i had iphone 7+, and never pay again for new iphone.. all iphone are same,, since iphone 2g,,, the iphone turns boring asme app, same icons,, same layout.. just re-desing for out side...
DESTROYER PLANET X. COMING 9/23 FUNNY COINCIDENCE FROM ILLUMINATI COMPANY
So basically they stole the s8s design
Where is the 9 directly 10
but at least they made a change, not about the circle in the middle, and the phone getting bigger.... need to get this.
If you want to read on this phone, 😐 it's impossible because a little touch gonna do something wrong
Hey look, they are just catching up to the galaxy s8 that I owned for almost a year now.
Apple creating technology to inslave people that the truth don't buy apple iPhone x
This is freakin' awesome!  Now my phone doesn't just spy on me.  Now it can recognize my friends too and spy on them.  That's not going to be abused... nawwww....
Anyone buying a xbox one x with this?
How do you restart iPhone X? It has no home button...
WOW everything Samsung has done already for $999
Oh boy here we go again..
it is super beautiful phone\nfor me it looks ugly
The only cool part is the animated emojis but that is not worth 1000
what are we proud of this phone?\nThey are still made in China.\n$1000 for stuff made in China.\nIn past 10 years, American middle class gone while I still applaud to Steve Jobs.\nShame on Apple not trying to bring wealth back to this motherland while few got super super rich.
If the front camera of the phone is always on. Doesn't this mean once when I masterbait it'll be watching me
Should have taken advantage of that bezel and stuck a camera into it. So thick on the sides.
I prefer touch id, mainly because you can unlock your phone when you're reaching for it in your pocket... Usually, the phone would be unlocked before you even look at it. I personally think apple is overdoing things just for the profits
I saw an add before the iPhone commercial.. A add in an add.. Addception?
More glass to break\nNo headphones jack\nOver $1000\nBut hey it finally has face recognition 🖕😂
This phone is lazy not worth the money. You will ne able to get the software in your phone
Why would I buy a crappy IPhone when I can go to my local dollar store and buy a phone for 6$?
Hows that going to work on Halloween or for the Muslim who wears a bag over their head. Or in a emergency when it's life or death and you only have someones else phone that's locked. Dumb...It's dumb.
IPhone 7 8 IPhone 9 that's why they skipped it
Remember when samsung got all of this in 2013??
im just gonna stick with My 7+
I dont care, a phone is a phone.
Looks like a bad version of the galaxy s8
I'd rather go back to a landline then buy one of these. Just not worth the price.
Nothing special with this. Looks just like a damn Samsung. Nothing caught my eye with the iphone 8+, and X. Ill be keeping my SE since I enjoy the 4 inch and the design of it.
People hating on the new iPhone cause they want it but can't afford it cause they're lazy slobs 😂😂
Where the iphone 9 at?
They bouta clone you with that face I'd
Welcome to the iPhone x it's an s8 but with Apple software enjoy
Welcome to capitalism where people will spend 1000 dollars the same exact phone they got last year because of a name
Soooo...it's a Samsung S8 re-wraped in a $900 Apple iCase.
Lol it's like a glaxely 8  rip off. Sad.
I'm not here for it....
You guys remember when phones were used just for calling?
What if you're playing a game like that paper toss where you swipe up, then you would immediately close the app. Waste of money, plus features taken away. Honestly garbage
So now you can crack your phones back..again
Great say goodbye to annonymity and privacy this phone gives apple and google the whole worlds ids for everyone.
I remember not that long ago when people were unboxing 3d printed models of the phone just so people got an idea of what it looks like, now the real thing is here it looks so amazing and smooth. i love how accurate the 3d models were.
Samsung did it first\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd better
Can't you just take a picture of the person's face and use that picture to unlock their phone?
I don’t care if the iPhone can turn into a drone... I just want a headphone jack in the new ones
I can wait for some junkie to sell me one for 5$
They are copying Samsung so much
the only iphone I'll get is the 6 nothing newer, everything else is too big and im not buying Bluetooth headphones or having wireless ones that I'll most likely lose within a week. makes no sense...
Super beautiful phone? You must have been on some hard stuff..
Damn now Samsung can't beat apple
girlfriend unlocks boyfriend's phone when he is asleep to check his messages.
*Next month: iPhone Xl*\n*-Charger port is removed, gotta buy one from Apple for $200*
I feel like if apple put a shitty phone everyone will buy it just cause its apple
Now starting at 3000.00
iporn xxx
Apple is traaaasshhhhh
1k for a damn phone? lmao
Wow that portrait mode worked sooooo well lol
$999? Clicks out video
Where  is number 9
Eh nah I'm still quitting apple
Nice samsung 8
Stand strong kekistan Brothers and Sisters, they will never oppress us! Heil Kekistan.
Pure cancer
what about the iphone 9?
looks like a bootleg S8.
Uhh, so what happened to iPhone 9?
no
The Emoji Phone
There copying Samsung
Next thing you know iPhone e=mc²
faggiest phone ive ever seen
SMH a $1000 yirp ok
iPhone=samsung
Is diversity ruining Apple's creativity?
What happen to iphone 9?
Samsung galaxy s8 looks better...
Iphone (fingerprints then face recognition to unlock the phone nice lol ) get spied by the government gg apple sell more details to go. We are being controlled and watched 24/7 from our fingerprints and the face recognition i already think they know where i live XD
I AM SO PROUD OF YOU BABE, ILSFM.
It looks like a pale imitation of a real thing. A demo of a bigger clip , even maybe a short movie , like Ride.
I am sorry, that speak to you.

LANA DEL REY IS SLEPT ON!!!\nIf One person listens to my music that would mean the world to me. \nBlack Man Streaming On My Page.
that was rather flat for Lana.......:-/
I don't fucking get it, the most boring song on the record and nothing happens in the video either...
I need a music video for Cherry!!
Does nobody else think she sounds bored as fuck and like, too tired to open her mouth all the way to sing? Fyi, I know that's not what's actually happening but it just has that sound to it..painful to listen to. lol
Close.... I want a yellow mustang
this is definietly made for best american record
Dear My God, \nthis song killed me..
Who's the guy? He's cute
Lyric\nPacking all my things for the summer\nLying on my bed it's a bummer\n'Cause I didn't call when I got your number\nBut I liked you a lot\nSlippin' on my dress in soft filters\nEverybody said you're a killer, but I\nCouldn't stop the way I was feeling the day\nYour record dropped\nThe day I saw your white Mustang\nYour white mustang\nThe day I saw your white Mustang\nYour white mustang\nCaught up in my dreams and forgetting\nI've been acting like armageddon 'cause you\nHeld me in your arms just a little too tight\nThat's what I thought\nSummer's meant for loving and leaving\nI was such a fool for believing that you\nCould change all the ways you've been living\nBut you just couldn't stop\nThe day I saw your white Mustang\nYour white mustang\nThe day I saw your white Mustang\nYour white mustang\nYou're revving and revving and revving it up\nAnd the sound, it was frightening\nAnd you were getting a part of that\nYou're gonna hit me like lightening\nWhite mustang\nYour white mustang\nThe day I saw your white Mustang\nSaid you're a wild Mustang\nYou're gonna hit me like lightening\nYou're gonna hit me like lightening
Am i the only one feeling Guns and roses thing here? Slightly of course
For some reason Lana's Music and Music video all sound and look the same has a 90's feel to it
I'd let her ride my white mustang, if you know what I mean.
Is anyone getting Hunger Games vibes right now?  Or is it me?
Dear Lana Del Rey, i want to see you cover Safe and Sound, please. I think it is the best song for you
Who wants Lana's hair?
How come a dystopian city so beautiful and romantic like 60s? \nYes Lana can
My new fav song :3 those whistle tho (is on my phone ringing)=D
I'm so angry I dont understand her genius.
What is the music that playing while they are dancing?💃🏻
Finally she's back.!!!
White Ferrari is better though
I will buy a white mustang because of lana
His luscious locks are almost equivalent of Lana's.
I missed so much this type of songs from Lana...
Now, we need 13 Beaches and Cherry for fuck sake
I came for the white mustang. To my disappointment a mustang wasn't even in this video
I'VE BEEN WAITING TOO LONG FOR THIS
The mv looks like those luxurious cigarette commercial advertisements
3:28 i think lana is going to maybe release another music video for get free
At 3:28 begins get free maybe thats the next video\nI'm so excited. that's one of my favorites
All her songs sound the same
every fucking song today is I hate you or I love you
i love you ! Where are you from?
What is this White Mustang?
SEE YOU AGAİN ON 10 M \n14.09.2017

me encanta lana, perfecta 🍉🐆
lanapalooza
Uai
LANA MOM IM PROUD
Mis patas huelen a queso
Creo que la canción y él vídeo hacen alusión a cuando una caracteristica de alguien simplemente te fascina y enamora, puede cegarte y evita que veas todo lo negativo que esa persona tiene, a pesar de ello ese encanto te mantiene enganchado hasta que decides liberarte, con Lana hay que ver los símbolos él Mustang Blanco es lo que la hizo enamorarse del chico malo y no hay que tomarlo de forma literal.
Se escucha Get Free en el segundo 3:31 <3
Lanita de mi vida, saca el vídeo de Summer Bummer ya. Por favor te lo pido.
Porque isso tá em alta no brasil?
love this lot! :)
Can we all have A moment of silence for Lana's beauty
I LOVE THE ARCHITECTURE MUSIC VIDEO, wait White Mustang???
I still love u
❤🎶
Hello Lana fans, I just wanted to say that I do song covers on my channel, in case you're interested…I'm having some issues right now, but I will get back on track soon, hopefully…Sorry for the self-promotion, when you're a small channel it's pretty hard getting your content out there…Thank you from Italy :) <3
play this song in a Mercedes commercial
Fabulous!
Put that white mustang into Lana (Spelt Backwards).
How I thought she told us that she is more independent than ever ... I like this Future style

Yeah the moondreamers ❤ i still have a cassette from moondreamers
Hunter is my niece's name. Such a good name.
I love the name Daniel 😍 Can't wait to hear what you're gonna name Baby Pentland!
I love darcy she is a angle
MY NAME IS APRIL
I know where the actress who plays lavender in Matilda works
Are you going to be a single mother of two, with two different baby daddy's? Just like the girls on the estates.
Not street like street worker 😂😂 I love your awkwardness Louise! #relatable lol
I think the baby's name is Lucy or something along the lines
Love this video! I'm currently bored in hospital being induced because my soon to arrive son has been playing silly games with me! I'm 37+3 At the moment and we chose his name quite early. A lot of my friends didn't like it, but no one has changed my mind. Can't wait to actually officially announce it now :)
So.... is your new baby going to be called Danielle? cos ya know, my name is beautiful!
Poor Landon in KK and baby J 😂😂😂😂
I love the name Daniel as well. Especially since one of my favorite youtubers is Daniel howell, Coincidence? I. Think. Not.
Hunter is my sons name ❤️❤️❤️
Hi Louise...\nI dont like those names either..Makayla or Landon\nLove the names you picked for twins...\nLove the L names\nViolet is one of my faves\nLove the Boys Names\nTop 3 girls names are beautiful.\nDont do celebrity but love luna\nCocoa isn't a fav for me...\nI don't like Oscar Landon Hadyn \nApril is nice.\nLove love Love Lavender\nPeggy is lovely an really ol fashioned
My mom's name is Peggy
My name is Violet 😂😂😘😘😘
it's actually the man's sperm that determines if you get a male or a female baby, somebody should've told Henry VIII
Ouch Not Gonna Lie when you said you didnt like the name Mikayla/Michaela/Mikaella/Michaella[<which is my spelling] it hurt a little bit because thats my name, obviously, but I, myself, do understand your dislike for the name lol! Love you Louise! 💙
This makes me pretty happy about my name tbh.
Whenever I hear a british accent say Percy I always hear Pu$*y!!  Have to do a double take every time!
My Mum's name is Peggy..
Love the color of your top
i've known a little girl that we called coco and her full name is chloe.
My favourite celebrity baby name is Channing and Jenna Tatums baby girl's name, Everly. I'd never heard it before then and I think it's one of the most prettiest names ever.
i like how louise talks like she's talkin to another mom and i'm here like :)) heyy
Hi Louise, not wanting to pressure you at all but are you going to do a baby name reveal or are you going to wait till baby Pentland is born? I'm really enjoying all your pregnancy videos and can't wait till we find out baby Pentland's name! Lots of love Lily! ^_^
I think you're naming her Lucy
Louise if you are looking for a name to dislike, how about Abcd (pronounced Abced). My cousin works  as a child advocate in a children's hospital.  There was a woman who named her son that. My response was: And did they arrest her for child abuse? Please tell me we can all agree that this is a horrible. I've also seen women whose names are Erica/Erika spelled Airwrecka. Notice I said women, as in plural. Yep, that's a thing people.
My nephew's name is Hunter and my niece is named Aubrey! So funny:)
My eyes almost popped out of my head when I saw the words baby name! xD
For some reason, I think the baby's name might be Penny.  That would be very cute!
I love the name Coco as well. If I was having a baby girl I would name her Cobie and nickname Coco. I also love boy names for girls.
my two girls are Justine and Samantha.  I love Michaela and Langdon and I still like you.
Our cats called Luna and our daughter Evelyn 😍
My wee boys name is Hunter
When I saw the title of this video I thought it was going to be a challenge for us, so we could guess the name you have chosen for Baby Pentland, a la Jesssfam. She always does little riddles so the viewers can guess. If can be bothered too, pls consider this as a way of doing the name reveal. It's fun to guess ☺️
The baby could've been named Josefina
Percy & Lucy sounds like a sitcom
Always watch these videos to see if my name comes up in them 😂😂 not heard about anyone talking about the name Hazel 😂😂😂
1. Sebastian & Florence \n2. Sonny & Nancy \n3. Amanda & Danielle, Emmett & Freddie, Noah & Vanessa \n4. Erin (my middle name, so I'd just switch my first & middle name round) \n5. Florence, Freddie, Flynn & Frankie (all girls, though I used Freddie as a boy's name above) \n6. Leo \n7. Indigo \n8. Sebastian, Emmett & Freddie \n9. Aubrey, Lydia & Danielle \n10. Harper \n11. Cherry \n12. Tracy, Carly/Carla, Jessica & Carl \n13. Cherry \n14. January \n15. Ryan (for a girl) \n16. Zara
I love the names Liliah and Harrison❤️
I have a niece named April and autumn.
WHERE ARE THE LUCY'S ?!?
I'm sooo curious about the name of baby #2 ☺️ I personally loooove names with Y endings! Darcy, Oakley,   Poppy 😍
Daniel 😭 if you ever have a boy named Daniel, Dan HASSS to be the Godfather!!
I need the jumper. where can i find it? xxx
I'm a twin and I'm Rebeccah and my sisters is Emily, if we were boys we'd have been called Kevin and Jason(the thought we were bus at first)😂
i wish you tagged linz
OMG I loved the moondreamers!!!! I always remember one where sparky and Bucky got stuck together !! Aaah the good ol' days lol

Did anyone else flip when she said Daniel
If you named a child Colette their nick name could be CoCo :))))
100% think she's going to name this baby Lucy. I know she's said in this video how much she loves it and it goes well with Darcy.
Whenever someone says the name April I think of the girl from teenage mutant ninja turtles
My birth control pill is called Cilest so I can't take it seriously 😂😂 sure it has ruined a perfectly lovely name. Daniel is also my favourite boy name! x
Louise if you really like coco then you could always give it to baby pentland as a nick name like you call darcy doodles
Haha right after you said not to be offended by the names you don't like I was expecting names I hadn't heard of or something. Then you said my name (Mikayla)! I laughed pretty hard. I mean obviously I like my name, but it wasn't super common when I was named it (I'm 20) which is nice. No hard feelings Louise!
I really hope Dina does this tag !! <3
I hope she's called Florence I love that name it's a lovely name!!!! And I love the name nevaeh heaven backwards💓💓
I ended up calling my hamster Celeste... she's dead now lollll 😂😂😂😂
I love the name Eloise
I remember there being a cartoon elephant called Celeste
My youngest daughters name is Aubrey :) she is 15  ! She loves watching Dan and Phil and she loves when you hop on with them ;)
Hearing Dina being mentioned just made me so happy and warmed my heart. I feel she is not included as much within the YT community, and watching you include her just made me very happy. :)
I've always loved the name Aubree since watching teen mom 2! It's one of my favourites and I love names that aren't too common. I like:Boys: RonanEduardo NoahEdgarGirls:AubreeNovaleeCleoBlairRosalind
She once said that when she was pregnant with Darcy she was doubting between Florence and Darcy so i slightly hope it's Florence
Celeste is such a pretty name! I think it would fit you really well!
OMG, my name is Viola- no one ever mentions it!!! This had made my day 😄😃
Louise, missy and Anna should get together! By far my fave women Youtubers!
I thought of violet right before you said it
i think her name will be delilah or lucy!!! so excited for you :)
My bets are that baby pentland is gonna be named Delilah, Lilah or Lucy...what are your guesses guys?
OMG I used to watched moondreamers I loved it but don't know what it was called x
1st question are my two favourite
Does anyone know where this jumper is from?!? I'm a fellow curvy gal and I NEED IT! :)
I think that the baby 👶 will be called Lucy (not just because it's my name 😂)
I love your jumper! Also lots of the names you chose are very lovely.
Love that top Louise!
I loved MoonDreamers as a pipsqueak ... Make your dreams take flight
LOUISE MY BROTHERS NAME IS DASH I CAN'T FREAKING BELIEVE YOU KNOW OR LIKE THAT NAME TOO! IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL! Btw would his full name be Dashiell?
Yes! Lavender Brown in Harry Potter
I think she's calling it Lucy

I have never watched narcos or any of the trailers so I have no idea what the actual show is like. But if it was like this I would put it on the watch list
The actually story is so fucking dark, this is too funny😂😂😂
I'd watch this movie. Lol
Someone  in Hollywood should  make  this into  a movie or a tv show
They should make this a fucken movie!
If this isn't one of the best thing's that I've ever seen, I don't know what is. This is actually a really fucking epic and awesome comedic rendition. Ya'll are fucking geniuses.
The long wait was worth it for this video. holy shit. If this is Narcos was actually like, written by you - I'd watch it.
This seems like it could be a good movie. I would watch it.
This had me crying a little bit.
In some points, I forgot that I watch a BLR video.. I thought that this is a real wierd movie trailer.
love has a thousand points that's deep, man, haha!
What's the song at 7:25?
I'd watch this show, the actual show this is spoofing though? Nah, not my cup of tea
Still a better story than twilight...; )\n(Sorry dead meme)
I want to watch this movie!!!!!
This was soo good!
I can imagine this movie with Zach Galfinakas playing the main character
SOY PABLO LMFAO. ah man this was so well done. made it look like a coming of age film or something lol.
If I wanted to watch dumb spics grow drugs and murder people I'd move to Mexico.
I would actually pay to see this show if it was real
Fantastic work on this!
A movie I would watch... Big Bang/10.
Bunny: well... it's not cool to have a hand up your butt \n\n😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Please make one for *Westworld* , you have clearly perfected the art .
With that voice and scenes that were picked he is a totality different person. LMAO
Pure GENIUS. Funniest thing in ages and NO lips can errors 😂
I haven't a clue what the original series is, but if it isn't about somebody pretending to be Pablo and then falling in love with really being him then I don't want to watch it. I'd watch this show for sure though.
This was a good show.   But I liked how you totally changed it, looked almost real, obviously the voices made it funny.  I'm glad I saw the show before this trailer or id be confused.
This one is really good. Nice job BLR
a new level for BLR quality.
What's the song at the end of the trailer? It's so emotionally powerful that gives me goose bumps every time.
hey I live in Pensacola
I'd rather see this then the actual Narcos.
It's like Dave
This one is like a touching movie's trailer ;-; or isn't it？
I would actually watch this xD
Lol. Ohhhhhh man this was hi la ri ous!!!!! Loved it.
This is the best BLR. Hands down.
I came here to laugh, but I left in my feelings.
This is simply the best!
This is their best work.
FEATURE LENGTH!!!  Must see a FEATURE LENGTH ONE OF THESE!!!
Why do I want to watch this as a movie!
This was really fun to watch. Great job
You guys have earned my like
*Jelly. I like it.*
The basic plot of Soy Pablo is very much like Dave (with Kevin Klein and Sigourney Weaver). If Narcos had a similar plot, I would consider watching it. If not, meh. I'm tired of all the dark and depressing shows.
Please make a full episode of the show just using edits from Narcos! I would watch this show!
if this was a movie I'll watch it
That was great guys!
What a rollercoaster!!   I was so close to dislike and not finish but then it was awesome!!
If this was real, I would watch it.
It turn out to be more emotional than funny
4:14 That guy sounded extremely close to one of the minor characters from Kung Pow....
The baby poking thing had me roaring
IT 2017 trailer bad lip reading? the movie was exceptional
I love this. If this was a movie, I would watch it
Dang boyyyy...I wasn't expecting it to get as emotional like it did near the end xD
such a master piece
Is it just me or does anyone else want to watch Narcos
I only date women who have tiny fingers!! 🤣🤣🤣
That was the best thing ever
I would watch this!
I wish this was real
4:28 sounds like a squeaky white board marker
How can someone be so creative with such consistency? This is simply amazing because it shows hard-work, talent, and a sincere love for his work
Dude you need to get into making Full length movies. Like making fun and covering movies like MST3k. I would pay to watch it. :)
This was pretty funny lol
A true dramedy
Nicely done BLR!
Hahahaha
7:17 music?

Quit messing around. We ALL know you're going to review It. So just do it already Georgie.
I want to see the Punisher !
Honestly just wanted to watch Jake Johnson make fun of Tom Cruise the whole time. This movie was terrible.
Instead of a universe with 30s horror I want to see a universe with modern horror icons like Jason, Michael Myers, Ash, Freddy, etc. etc. That'd be cool.
I forgot about that detail about the trailer!! It's still hilarious! \nSo glad I didn't see this film. \nThanks for another great video Screen Junkies :)
they're gonna ruin my childhood with the new jumanji reboot too, won't they?
A revised Monsters Universe would of been a great idea, but the industry has more bankers than artists, and today's audience at large, has no patience or heart for sincere horror,

Not a carrier? Then who brings your groceries places? It's not me, is it? That would be weird if I didn't know that.
That last line will be just dripping with dramatic irony 80-100 years from now.
DNA tests hold as much weight as astrology in science terms. The amount of DNA any individual inherits from relatives just a few steps up their family tree is negligible compared with the vast amount we all share from common ancestors. It means any ancestral history identified by a simple genetic test is just one of dozens of possible interpretations, and to try to trace our lineage directly through our genes is absurd. We are better off conducting our own investigations and creating a family tree to view our history. This kind of DNA testing seems to be heavily promoted at present, but they are fundamentally a scam.
I really love your top
IVE BEEEN WAITING FOR A YOUTUBER TO BE ASHKENAZI JEWISH

Hey, Emma, the asparagus thing isn't about you being able to smell asparagus...it's about your urine smelling weird after eating asparagus.
Are you wearing the same shirt as the last video?
Finding out you have amazing genes then, pretty much, advertised by Apple just after.  What the hell Emma?  What next?  x'D
Welcome to the Scandinavian-Jewish community sister!😄😂\n\nP.S: I'm Scandinavian-Jewish.
The asparagus thing isn't whether you can smell it, but actually if your PEE smells like asparagus after you eat it. Some people do, some people don't. It's kinda weird.
You are a human
North West Europe normally doesn't include Scandinavia. It usually refers to the area containining France, Germany, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, and whoever I missed. Scandinavia normally isn't included with that bunch because we're our own kind of (semi-weird) people.
I love her shirt, any ideas where she got it or where I can shop similar styles?
You should watch SmarterEveryDay's video where Detain looks. Bit more at the science of genome sequencing, it was really enjoyable
Why is there #Shook on the title card...
You're 100% bad at interpreting data. Broadly NW European includes British, Irish, French, German, and Scandinavian. Why on Earth would you assume that entire 14% was Scandinavian!? Jesus. You likely have trace amounts of Scandinavian since it seems common among British/Irish folks. I think the Vikings landed on our islands and raped our women.
So funny. I knew seconds before that you were gonna say 'I'm gonna live forever' hahahahaha. You and me both, kid. 😉🙋😏
I have alpha 1 AT deficiency, the third thing down on the list. Lol
Why does Emma keep saying things are odd or creepy it's not guesswork they're literally using science to read your genetics like?
So basically if a zombie apocalypse breaks out it'll be your blood we'll all need. ....guess now's the best time than ever to ask, are you bloodtype O?
Emma your shirt is so cute!
It's a bit asks that dan just did this
Is your surname a clue?
Okay so the DNA analysis is cool... but WHERE DID YOU GET THAT SHIRT
The sleeves on that dress are like my favorite thing A+++ good outfit wear it always
What company did you use for the results?
Where did you get your top? It's amazing I love it!
23 and me is going to build a YouTube Master Race by fixing clones of Youtubers and creating the most powerful MCM GeneMoneyGrab LLC.    ;-P

Scandinavian🇩🇰🇳🇴🇸🇪🇫🇮 \nWelcome to the family 😂
I should say that those 14% Scandinavian are probably all in your face, because you are one of the prettiest British girls out there!
I spat in the tube recently as well...\n\n...the police have now cautioned me because apparently that's no way to behave on the London Underground system!!!
I did not know ts dairy thing. No wonder when I eat quite a bit of cheese etc I feel ill.
I don't appreciate how clickbaity you are nowadays
Here's to a long and successful life for you, Emma.
What brand is your top?
Just read the piece in the Evening Standard and congrats  on the Apple thing. May want to correct the paper though cause I'm sure you got more than 149000 subscribers
that dairy thing didn't happen to me... I cut out cows milk for years as a teenager to help clear my skin... switched back when I began living part time with my boyfriend... nothing happened. Skin had already cleared as much as it  was going to, and experienced no other adverse effects :)
I've been watching you for quite some time now, Emma, never knew you had CFS/ME till today. I have it too! Random, I know. But it's just nice to know there's someone else who gets it aswell
Iw ant to take this so BAD cause according to basically all my family members, I'm like, 25 races xD (not rlly I have been told I'm like, 5 or 6 I think)
Do you still have cheap plastic trophy that Tom Scott gave you?
Make another vid with dan pls it's been years I wanna see if he's still double your hieght
You are a genetic lottery lol
OMG, ok, the video is great but WHERE DID YOU GET THAT SHIRT! *grabby hands*
Which test was this? 😜
nice results, I wander what mine are, but too lazy to findout
You're plant-based? AWESOME, good for you!! :) The reason humans easily become intolerant to dairy is because it is for calves; pretty logical really haha
Be proud of you European heritage
Part of me wants to do this, another part goes eh, I can spend that £100 on other stuff, I'm not *that* bothered about finding out. I'm a freak, proud of it and don't need any genetic tests to tell me lol
Emma is 3rd on the trending page at the time of this comment, Whoop
I love genetics, and by extension this, but my parents won't let me do this because they think the people behind it will try and frame me for a crime... \n\n\nYeah.
Emma i will find you and i will marry you. \nCook for you,\nGive you a massage when  you're tired,\nListen to how your day was,\nHug you, \nAnd love you :) 😂😂😂\nI know it sounds creepy af 😂
Well just seems like a total waste of money, why would anyone want to have their DNA on some companies database anyway, maybe she didn't think about that though.\nHow does anyone know how that information will be used in the future? let's hope she doesn't decide to have a microchip implanted next.
A lot of people will be from North European countries because of Vikings, Danes, Saxons, Angles and Normans etc invading in the past a reproducing with each other
And then I just didn't exist made me choke on my water
I've actually been using charcoal powder for a couple of months now and noticed a HUGE improvement with the whitening and general hygiene of my teeth.

Broadly Northwest European does not mean Scandinavian, it could mean British, Irish, French, Dutch, German etc or Scandinavian.
My prediction before watching video. You are 100% Canadian

Do you know that your number 3 on trending👏🏻👏🏻
I just clicked on this video to say fuck you for the clickbait title in my feed
anyone know where i can get the shirt Emma is wearing??? i absolutely love it
When she said yeah I have a lot of freckles I was like you have 10 (ish). THATS NOT A LOT OF FRECKLES
Oh no she is going to live forever. Imagine all the salt she can spread.
EMMA IS A SLIGHTLY YOUNGER JEN BARBER FROM THE IT CROWD AAAAAAAAHHH
I already know my DNA makeup, I looked at my clothes draw.\n\n\n\nWhat? Thats were I keep my *JEANS*\n\n\nimsorryillgonow...
I love u Emma ❤️❤️❤️😍😍😘😘
Haha sorry to disappoint you Emma,  but you're not Scandinavian:/  If you were your DNA profile would give you a percentage of Scandinavian. Broadly Northwestern European -DNA is DNA usually from the British isles or France, but is unknown and can not be pinpointed to either places! Just take a look of some of the Buzzfeed DNA videos...
ur a wizerd
sweden loves you <33333

Didn't Vox do kind of a similar video about the Mona Lisa, and how it only really became famous after it was stolen? Or am I thinking of another channel?
Lord, bless me to get be on my communication disorder and complete my education for Your honor and glory with more accuracy and professionalism than I have in my life now.
It's gotta be illuminati
Exactly how I feel about 'The Glass Castle' by Jeanette Walls
Guy, Reads To Kill a Mockingbird 6 times. Hates himself, decides to justify why the book sucks instead.
Never read it in school. Tried to afterwards. After three chapters, returned it to the library.
You ignored Boo Radley. That's why.
To be honest all i got out of this vid was a newfound appreciation for paperback books.
I disagree. To Kill a Mockingbird was the first book in my 20s. I didn't read in high school and picked up the book while wondering an airport bookstore. Much to my surprise the imagery created in the book got me hooked to reading. I try to read everyday and I'd like to think TKAM had a lot to do with it. Kind of like if you try something for the first time and you like it, you're more likely to do it again. Great story, holds over time. I'll have to read it again to see if the meaning has changed for me.
Maybe you shouldn't have moved so many times.
the book is NOT overrated.
I hated this book. It is overrated.
What a cheap stunt by Vox to take an american masterpiece like Mockingbird and call it overrated. My guess is all the people agreeing with the sentiment probably haven't read it since school. Read it again. It is more topical than ever in this climate of seemingly well meaning people falling prey to racism.
Now I know why Taylor swift's new single is number 1.
Never read it but I never thought it would even be good.
I never understood the popularity of this book. I never found it engaging at all.
My teacher said that this book was one of the best books she's ever read, and it always makes her emotional. So i was kinda excited to read it, but it ended seeming like a very pointless story in my opinion. Very boring and dull, but thats just my opinion.
I didn't like it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIGHT ME.
the book is so popular that i'm pretty sure there is two copies of it in my family house and no one in that house reads, on top of that it was the one school assignment i missed but seen the movie for :D
...600% better than [the books you read zero times]? What's 600% of 0? Smh.. If you read the books proportionately to how good they are then TKAM would have been infinitely better than the others (even at 1 read). Prob should have mixed in an algebra book
So it's so famous bc of paperbacks???!
The movie is quite good. Gregory Peck playing Atticus worked really well, it would be hard to think of a more contemporary actor being suited to that role.
Why did they ban this book though
This is interesting explains how it got popular but it doesn't discredit the story at all?? Like\nOf course ppl liked it it's a gr8 book and the fact that it became so accessible spread it quickly but if it was overrated we wouldn't still be studying it today. Also it's not the books fault u moved so much smh
Everyone else read it once. Why you moving 6 times.
TLDW: the book is over rated because they sold a lot of copies.
i had to read it in highschool, but as a girl in the rural north present I didn't actually understand the words said, but i understood translated pieces from other times and cultures just fine, but that was like, harder to read than spanish for me
1961 was the height of the Civil Rights Movement... It was popular because it was so relatable...
They're too late to restrict hardcover book sales. Electronic publishing has already basically killed traditional printing for cheap high volume books.
Do the Mona Lisa
A lot of books on the school curriculum are overrated and should be replaced.
next is wonder woman
That moment when youve never read it and thought it was about killing mocking birds\n\n\n\n\n\nBookbait
I know it's meant as a joke, but there's no way you could logically come up with 600%.
False equivalency.  No one school system made you read it 6 times.
I couldn't disagree more. This is trending? Yikes
Yeah, i never *had* to read it for school, but I read it for fun in 5th grade, but I had to read a bunch of other books that perhaps don't have as much social importance/literary quality. So for me, is the book 1000%+ underrated? I'm just saying the logic in the beginning of this video doesn't really make sense.
I only read it because I had the chance.
And it was certainly not a new theme. A better story was Daniel White, For the Greater Good, by Harlan Ellison. A black kid rapes a white girl, has no remorse, and the black civil rights leaders give him over to a lynch mob to become a martyr for the Greater good of their cause.
Vox being a sucky news outlet presenting what it claims is the ultimate truth on a widly respected book.
You look similar to macklemore
Overrated should do a video on White Paintings!\n\nahem - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aGRHOpMRUg
How do I alt key a swastika?
Next up in the Overrated series, Christopher Nolan?
Tim Johnson is the real reason
IF you told me that, I'd be so triggered that I'd have to watch a few seconds of this video to leave a reply.
Eh... perhaps Penguim books contributed to part of it's success, but the argument simply doesn't hold water by itself.\nThere are some key factors in To Kill a Mocking Bird that several literary staples and cases of explosive success and endurance also usually have:\n\nA somewhat subversive style for the time. As in, uncommon type of literature that took some by surprise.\nAlso subversive ideas. Exploration of taboo and controversial themes.\nUsually a fresh take on a theme.\nPortrait of a given era that people might not be quite familiar with - microcosm exploration.\nCloseness to the authors' own raw, potential scandalous stories, sometimes drawing controversies after publication, sometimes not so much.\nSimple writting, easy to follow, easy to understand.\nA somewhat realistic style, often coming with a bit of grittiness to it.\nNot following a mainstream or conventional structure - monomyth, clear moral lessons, etc.\n(optional) Realistic and raw coming of age story, reality crash, or a complete change of perspective and opinion. Critical reasoning put to test.\nThe common people in extraordinary circunstances thing.\nAll of those might be realized right after publication, up to years after the author has already died... matter of perception of the time it exploded in popularity.\n\nA whole bunch of literary classics follow some of these, when not all of these. Kerouac's On the Road, Sallinger's Catcher in the Rye, Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Palahniuk's Fight Club, Capote's In Cold Blood... to name a few.\n\nSee that I'm not criticising the works for following a certain structure nor trying to diminish the works because they have common characteristics... rather, I love them all and think they deserve the success.
Back in the day they really liked to emphasize women's nipples, didn't they?
Thought this book was gonna be about Go Set a Watchman and how that book was the original draft of To Kill A Mockingbird. GSAW takes the story of TKAM and flips it on its head, and it is so very underrated compared to TKAM.
fantastic. so ready for more.
If you're going to cover an overrated mid-century American paperback ubiquitous in public schools, cover _The Catcher in the Rye_ .\nI mean, it was good, but geez.
To be honest I think The Secret Life of Bees was a much better book that touched all the same values. This book just made me cry. Not that TSLOB didn't, but...I found it more relatable and I feel like I really learned something from it.
TBH, I'd rather to kill a mockingbird rather than read bless me ultima again for English class
I actually never read how to kill a mocking bird...
So... why'd it become popular?
If you are not hypnotized by the awesome graphics, skip to the reason, somewhere around 3:22.
I think it's because teachers are lazy and fail to update their curriculums and lesson plans. There are countless worksheets and assignments from my high school dated from the 80s and 90s
I only clicked because im reading yo kill a mockingbird r8 now.
I hate it so much
Hey a good video that isn't propaganda, good job vox
Because they forced you to read it in High School and do book reports on it. I personally liked The Hobbit better.
I don't get this book. It's not good. Nothing happens. You can literally skip entire chapters and miss nothing. Am i missing something here? Why do people like it? Like not from a business point of view but a critic point of view.
American school's favorite liberal white guilt indoctrination tool.
Do The Beatles next. If there is any cultural flotsam as egregiously overrated as them I'd be surprised.
I like how penguin books had a few years where they just were not loving there logo. Sure they changed it often in general, but 1938 was just: nope, nope, eh... well keep it for four years. And 1948 was just: Good lord! look at that lower body!, and there, that'll do for the rest of the year.
It's a pity you spent 50% of the video's duration simply restating the question
I'll ship your vanities to you . order InFurniture Inc @ HOUZZ,\n916 as your middle name I'll ask for your discount but I doubt it pal.
I'm 17 and never heard of this book, am I the only one??
Did you forget to finish this video?  The reason the book is overrated was never explained?
It's popular because it's good. That's about it really. No hidden thing goin' on.
It's overrated and anvilicious like woah.  But some anvils need to be dropped, and To Kill A Mockingbird still drops that particular anvil pretty damned well.
guess im not the only one that thought it was overrated.
If your looking for a interesting and (I guess) grounded explanation for how books such as To Kill a Mockingbird become a sensation I recommend the The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell.
Never read this in school. Found it at my grandparents house when I was 9. This IS my favorite book. It's well written and takes you to that time and that place like no other story I've read. Sorry, in my mind your just slightly over rated. Like love, it's all in the eyes of the beholder.
no... the catcher in the rye is the worst book thought in school
This video explains how it was lucky to get popular, but that doesn't make it overrated
Vox is just trying to discredit the book. They just don't like the author because of the racism undertones in her books.
All I heard was Reddit
do the dark Knight and toy Story 3
I had to read it for summer reading over the summer, and now I’m Jem in my school’s fall play :)
I read this my 9th grade year you read it in 4th grade... my teacher said it had one of the best endings ever but I didn't understand one bit on how it was one of the best Nobel endings
bcz school forces us to read it so every1 knows it
The book was so damn boring
I Love This Book ♥️♥️
Catcher in the Rye and how it influenced Mark David Chapman.
Hate me all you want, but I hated being taught Romeo & Juliet. All throughout the 4 years of highschool English, we had to analyize Romeo & Juliet in some way or another.\n\nDude its an okay story, but its not something that should be shoved down our throats. Seriously, I never learned any English from it other than antiquated words that can not be integrated into modern vocabulary. Waste of time.
There are many interesting videos on youtube america.
I Vox was supposed to be PC. Isn't calling a book about black people's struggles overrated kind of the opposite?
1984
Who has read hatchet?
People still read? Whaaaaaaaaat.
Next, how democracy is overrated?
i hate vox

Never really liked it.
Hey phil, whats your home town im curious?
I spent the best years of my childhood playing hide n seek in an old fridge....
why the fuck is this trending
1 less VLOG on the trending makes me happy
What happens when the soviets attack and we've smashed all the doors off our Fridges? How will we protect ourselves from the nuclear blast wave?!
why would i ever go into a fridge?
Who the hell keeps an old fridge at home?
Why is this trending? Are fridge deaths on the rise
Indiana jones survived in one
It saved Indiana Jones... yep that happened
why is this trending in 2017
Yeh, this would have been much better narrated by pflax as Sean Bean
I swear they talked about this on a recent Triforce episode?
Now the kids are just eating the entirety of the content in the fridge . .yay obesity . If kids knew they could kill might scare em off a bit
Hi everyone thanks for watching  this advert was shown for many years in the 70s and well into the 80s often during children's school holidays scary but effective .
Old fridges can kill??? Omg didn't know the 70s had sentient fridges. They kept that one hidden... 😱
I'm assuming this public service announcement is so on the nose and heavy handed because something serious happened...
Kim Jong-Un making this trend?
Anyone here from YogPod Triforce?
One saved Indiana Jones.
The triforce podcast
Ok then
Why is this trending?
People say this for many things but this is the best example\n\n\nWhy is this trending ?!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvJb1bVgVRA&t=38s better q video
why is this trenidng 2011 rly..
Why is this trending???!? Lol
This was on TV recently.
Why is this 33 on trending though
0:13 Boy, that escalated quickly
Don't play inside of fridges, noted. Thanks again for this. 
The YogPod sent me. Be Warned.
Nowadays the danger of this is invisible because fridges now have magnetic seals instead of locks and they put masking tape over the doors to keep children out.
Nothing more scary in the 70's than an old fridge containing Jimmy Saville and Gary glitter.
nuke bomb shield to indaina jones
What a shame! I'm single, on benefits, and I bought a luxury fridge freezer for £2000. It got me into a lot of debt and now I've been evicted. I thought I could live in my fridge as its big enough but I guess not. Oh well, I'll have to shiver on the streets instead.
I remember the BBC broadcasting this child safety film inbetween Jim'll Fix It and Top Of The Tops
Thanks for watching today :) This had my heart pounding. Please share today with some friends and family.

Roman, you are giving to the police, remember at the Cavs game
Anyone else notice country’s heavy breathing
If a dog ever attacks you you grab the front legs and pull them apart as hard and as far as you can.
The Police drug the dogs sense and it's bad for the dogs brain that's why they are so mad and can smell 10 times better than a regular dog
I can be a pool boy. @LostCreekRambler on IG, Follow me!!!! All of your dreams will come true.

I'm pretty sure Roman doesn't want to break any more bones after he broke his wrist by punching the wall. Lol
Love Country he needs a shirt in your line.
I'm glad my notifications hv been delayed. I don't like seeing Cora in every video. Once every week is fine but everyday, don't post it in the vlog
I want to see NFL football player vs police dog see how fast the dog has to run lol

Am i the only one who noticed when James gave the drink to Ally she said Thanks Jimmy😂👀
Wheres the other one?
thanking God that I'm watching this on the toilet cuz I peed myself at Ally's reaction 😂😂😂
Jesus, to think that's the best they will ever look 😂
😂😂 Mani and Dinah sharing the cookie at 5 minutes. Lol
I honestly thought James had a bunch on strippers on the show. lol
6:07 When my girl ALLY wants a HUG ! u go and HUG her!!!😒❤️❤️
Lauren and Norma is ass I wish I could relate.
this is everything \nthank you James xx
Get them on karaoke carpool! So people can finally see how talented they are! Their songs don't showcase even 10% of what they can do!
Ally played that shit off so well hahahaha
6:08 she played that rejection off so well 😂
James Corden's laugh is what I live for HAHA
i thought Dinah Jane is the oldest
Look what I did 😩😩DINAH WHY ARE YOU SO FRICKIN CUTEE😍😍
ally looks so good with her hair like that, dinah is too cute putting the olives in her milk, normani is sexy as hell (duhhh) and lauren is too cute with that little pudge she has in her belly my four babies 😢❤️❤️❤️
I loved this lol. I want them to play more games with hosts now lol
Did they perform during this show or is that what they wear on talk shows?
I think they genuinely mesh well as four. I'm here for Dinah. They look happy.
Wtf she's not yet 21? She looks like she's early 30s 😂😂
I love them, but I wanna kill their stylist.
I have never clicked on a video so fast
Why do they have to dress like sluts
Lauren would actually be a good Bond girl.
Why is there only 4
i love how the girls were snacking on the cookies on the side..
I love this, so funny 😂 can we have a carpool karaoke with these girls pretty please 🙏🏻❤️
Why do they have to wear little to nothing
They all thicc but not as thicc as James babyface Corden right here
6:05 well that was awkward :D :D ..
I like Lauren's face on the thumbnail
I want the boots!
Of course Lauren drank the martini after
Camila is gone and now all of a sudden Lauren is recognized
I love how Lauren just drinks the glass after 😂
Idk their names but the blond girl with the red clothes was going to give James a hug at 6:07 but James walked away so she played it off like she was throwing her hands in the air 😂
Ally totally went for the hug at 6:07 hahaha
4:11 is the biggest lie I've ever heard
Why do they all dress so inappropriate, they are suppose to be something younger girls can look up too.
Dinah!! I'm so proud she has never drank :') me too girl
Normani: Feel my heart man.\n...\nNormani: Could be inappropriate.
Why the fuck has he got four prostitutes on stage??
Is nobody gonna point out how Norminah shared that cookie 🍪?! 😂😂😂
So cute how they share the cookie
Dinah look bout 27 lol she's not even 21mind blown
So it's 4th Harmony now... or?
When Ally screamed, all i could think of was that one takeover where she was in the woods
I thought Dinah was the oldest
Ally is so ugly ugh I can't. She needs to be kicked out of the group seriously. Her fake christianity annoys me plus she looks like a fat secondhand version of a gnome.
They're so fine
Not surprised tht lauren is the only one that had a sip of her drink 😂
Who Dinah's not yet 21??? They're so young but....
I get so weak whenever Lauren puts her tongue out ugghh bond girl it is!!! ❤
If you're a harmonizer you know this was torture for Ally you could see her covering her ears in the background lol
why do they dress like prostitutes
Dinah with the milk & cookies YES!😍👏 i would me some milk & cookies
Aaahhhh, why does lauren have to snatch my wig on literally everything she does
If I was Dinah I would have grabbed Mani's martini and ran osrs😴💀
Lauren taking a sip of the martini is straight up something I'd do. Free alcohol, I don't blame her lmao.

He's so ugly Jesus
Whenever my German friends started laughing while speaking to each other in German, I would awkwardly laugh along even though I had no idea what was funny. Then we would all just look at each other awkwardly.
Garbage
you ugly! fuck you ching cheng chong!
This fat chink isn't even funny
where is that countdown noise coming from....Ive heard it somewhere
Wow, you were forced to watch this rubbish quite closely more than ONCE?!?!?! I admire your strength to endure it!But thanx, all CinemaSins are absolutely guilty pleasures.
How did David got his body back?
everything wrong with Shooter would be a good one
The only movie that is worse that this, is sw ep7 poop.
You forgot the shitty ass prop guns made from 1980-2017 firearms rather than make something cool, like a precursor to the M41A Pulse Rifle.
Ridley Scott is basicly killing his own creation with the Prometheus trilogy! 😫
Good movie ... for a prequel but I'm still waiting for the proper Aliens sequel.
Why the fuck would they kill off shaw or better yet, the engineers?! This movie pissed me off more then Wreck it Ralph
Have you guys done anything to commemorate your large numbers of subscribers?
please make a video about Transformers TLK I really wanna know how you think about it
I know the movie has a number of problems, but even as a film major, I can't deny I love this movie. The first in the series since Aliens that I've actually enjoyed
All of this can be reconned away very easily. So I just want to see where Scott is going with this. Guess it's like someone watching a drunk friend trying to do something. I want to see if he pulls this off or fails badly and we all laugh at it.
Somehow their ship is a giant bomb that's set off by one misplaced shot, how does a society advanced enough to create warp drive and vehicles capable of interstellar travel through space full of little rocks moving at near light speeds build a ship that will completely explode if it gets hit by one moving a little faster than the speed of sound? *ding*
Hahahahaha the monty python ministry of silly walls skit is gold.
WHAT!!! still not at LV426......FUCK!!!!
Everything wrong with pirates of the Caribbean: deadmen tell no tales in 15 minutes or less
i know im not the only one waiting for the emoji movie review...
Dear @CinemaSins... could you, please, do The Crow? Considering what we know, the time that has passed, the dark and tragic circumstances surrounding the movie, and how much we love it. Thank you very much. :)
Where the fuck is guardians 2 bitch
Does anyone else get a feeling of déjà vu when I watch this plus what is with the movie sin counter 2.0
Could you do IT? I can't find the words to express my disappointment with it.
CinemaSins, I've got one you can add. In the scene when the crew was walking through the wheat, one of the crew members appears to be eating the wheat. Mind you, not one crew member conducted any kind of analysis before hand to even determine if the wheat was edible and yet, one of them is eating it. I know this is a work of fiction but really?! Another problem I had with this film is its trying to be Event Horizon. If you recall, the crew on that ship were following a beacon signal and not knowing or understanding its origin or who even made it. The rescue team has little to go on and have no idea of the evil they're about to face. Yep, its Event Horizon all over again.
Watch me. I'll do the fingering. No thank you. Last time I tried that, I got in trouble with the wife..... I didn't know you were married.
Why would they have a gay couple on a colonization mission?
I spit out my iced tea at the Cotton eyed joe joke 😂😂
This was much more enjoyable than the movie itself.  112.\n\nRidley Scott really disappointed me with this entry.
Also I think that the ship is meant to do that and the purpose is to wipe out a planet and start again but a side effect is that the black goo creates xenomorphs or something. ( the worms in Prometheus)
Transformers: The Last Knight
that woman who is the captain is a super ugly manboy lesbian twat
And the engineers made the black liquid to destroy mankind on Earth. It shows you in Prometheus
Just waiting for IT ,3,
So sad the fans raged about Prometheus and forced the producers to make an alien movie instead of furthering the engineers etc :(
You also forgot the fact that the old robot that tried to replace the new robot couldn't heal but the new robot could so that should've been a giveaway to the crew that it wasn't their robot but the old crazy one they found on the planet
*sigh*\n\nI guess we're stuck with Movie Sin Counter 2.0...\n\nIt's EFFING YELLOW!
As soon as i saw Danny mcbride i knew this was gonna be garbage.
I'm just sitting here sad the the xenos died again. Can one live to the end of a movie and not get killed? No, ok. :(
DO Stephen king's IT!!!!!!!!!!
Even though it is like I see the whole movie by watching this, I feel like I had to force myself since I watched the others already.
Got the balls to sin....Iron Giant?
please do the pirates of the caribian dead man tell no tales
Trash most of it it only his opinion
Do Everything Wrong with Transformers The Last Knight
Lotta hate for this movie in the comments, I liked it a decent amount, but I also haven't seen the originals since i was a litto wee lad
I wanted this movie to be good, so badly. But no. All the questions from Prometheus left incompletely answered, plus MORE questions. I think Ridley Scott's thesis is that humans are too dumb to live.
Can you do: Everything wrong with Guardians of the galaxy vol. 2?
Please do the End of Evangelion.
This movie was trash!!
I gotta say, on the food and utilities one, being on a colony ship with 2000 other people, I feel like 9? (I forgot how many of them start off) honestly might be able to live 7 years if they even decided to stay up the entire time
This movie was boring
What Hardcore Henry or IT
Everything wrong with the movie It 1990 please
Just throwing this out there, ofc Walter and David look exactly the same - they're Walter AI'S... they're supposed to look the same.
David left them live at the end because he wanted to test the alien's ability, it failed by dying
Am I the only 1 bothered by the yellow and font of movie sin counter 2.0
PLEASE DO A CINEMASON ON IT
You missed a sin.wait, why do the trucks fall downward after impaling the xenomorph, I'm sure the ship is equiped with gravity generators but There's no gravity beyond the hull in space so how is this achieved? Shouldn't it just kind of float away, like in GravityOh yes Georgey, they float
Why did the engineers not have an armada in space to inspect incoming ships before they come into the atmosphere
do the Road to El Dorado you cowards
EVERYTHING WRONG WITH THE MASK!!
He didn't cover that spores are way more sensible than giant eggs
Is it just me or is the guy reviewing this one of those small minded fake god fearing pricks...
They should do everything wrong with the original IT. And then do the new one
Basically they sent only the dumbest motherfuckers to colonize a planet
this video is so much better than the movie.... god damn it ridley scott
11:44 actually that is a xenomorph
Transformers the last knight is out😉
Hey, screw you, I have ears that clean. I clean them every single day as part of my shower/shave/brush teeeeth morning routine.
Animated Movie sins?.... Captain Underpants? Wow you did the boss baby a week ago
Now I want to see this movie for myself. When the damn DVD coming out?
Haven't watched yet but for the love of god I hope they mention the fact no one hears gunfire inside whats essentially a cave system.
This video is really terrible
do psycho! come on man.
Fuck this movie and all it stupid fucking Christian overtones
Do Death Note (Live Action) it is perfect for this channel!
I thought this movie was set on earth
2:11 But you didn't pass them right? Because you usually do need to do the homework to get a passing grade right? Teach me oh wise one.
I bfidn see it i still want to
Please do King Arthur: Legend of the Sword
I enjoyed this film. The atmosphere, the tone. Fassbender's performance. Though there are some problems. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArLRJ9-0X8g
Please do Everything Wrong with Death Note (2017)
Everything Wrong with 47 meters down
You should do Marie Antoinette next
EVERYTHING WRONG WITH HEATHERS PLEASE!!!!!
David created the xenomorphs. DINGDINGDINGDINGDING
Really... Prometheus II.
Long live Movie Sin Counter 2.0!
DO SAUSAGE PARTY
100th sin shouldnt count, b/c they couldve switched chips
Do the movie 9
Everything wrong with Whiplash please.
Uyyy papi you're trending so hard uuuuuuyyyy
Do IT 2017
Like for Lucius!
EWW scream 4 please!
Do IT please!
This movie is such garbage. I've seen rape porn that was more gentle than what the 21st century is doing to the alien franchise.
Like how these used to like 8 minutes then they discovered ad rev
What's with the Sin Counter 2.0? It's weirding me out. Especially with the yellow. I can't focus on the screen.
Do deep blue sea
In addition to all the things you pointed out, the thing that really bugged me in this movie was the preachy in-your-face pro-faith, anti-science theme. In case anyone was as dumb as the crew, they went to the point of stating it explicitly up front (which you sinned). Fine in veggie tales. Annoying in Alien.
Angelica's voice is like drugs. It gets me addicted to it so easily and I have to listen to her singing at least 10 times a day now <3
ang galing niya talaga
I hope you or Darci will win..but i really wants you to be da winner
hy hy \nits ty ty\ni wanna die die
Angelica Hale, the BEST singer ever! Love your voice!  You absolutely will win,  American Got Talent 2017.
I like her too but Darci deserves to win.. Darci can be a singer, comedian as well as a ventriloquist..
darci cannot do this performance. darci is hiding behind the puppet to look more cooler. Without that puppet, she's really nothing=fact of the matter.\nTake that puppet out and you will see and hear how mediocre and common her voice is. I've seen darci's many performances without puppet and she's not that good.\nAngelica is far more talented than darci in singing talent=fact. ....to be fair
She is going to win.
She have nice acent against other little singer.
she was good  but im sad that Christian and celine didnt go through they where good too
Congratulations amazing angel Angelica! Road to championship. :D
How can someone even dislike this? This world is full of strange people. Go Angelica Hale!!! You're so blessed. What an amazing little girl with the voice of an Angel! 😘😘
the whole Philippines is proud of you Angelica.
Angelica Hale - Her story is AMAZING!  A lot of people say it's the only reason why she is going to win AGT because of her story - My response: YES! Her story has made her the way she is now, her story has given hope for other kids her age to not give up on their dreams even through the toughest situation in life, her story is to show her inner-self confidence & be proud of herself & for making her family proud, people are quick to judge but not seeing the bigger picture, yes everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but let's not put this girl down of following her dreams just because of what other people say or do! We have a lot of keyboard warriors yet they simply can't accept or do what these people have bravely done for themselves to come this far. #WorldPeace #ANGELICA #AGT2017
I'm really proud of you Angelica Hale
oh my angelica you are amazing =)
When you realize that a 10 year old kid beats you in singing 😱😱😱😱 GoshDamn Angelica
0:00 replay button for anyone that doesn't want to wait for ty ty to be done.
I still like Mandy Harvey more. She's my million dollar act. Angelica is very talented But I have to give high credit to Mandy because she just brings it home every single time.
She's Filipina... Is so easy any song for that country.
Takes out that mic filter and then listen to it. But not bad for a ten year old.
Always pray for you Angelica good luck.
Singers and dancers are a dime a dozen.
Hi hi it's ty ty
I'm not the biggest fan of her song choices but she has such an amazing voice, I was so disappointed that Celine Tam didn't make it to the finals
The only bad part of this video was the last 10 seconds with cringe Tyra Banks
Too good to be true😍😍
2:03 microscopic flaw in the beginning of the whistle note (didn't really match the tune/pitch), but other than that, stunning vocal range and capacity!!!
she gonna win the whole show she is incredible for a 10 year old
You should see my best friend sing 🎤 she sings sooo good for an 11 year old girl 👍👍👍👍🎤🎤🎤🎤🎧🎺🎸🎼🎼🎼🎼🎹🎹
Angelica got the most viewed performance Wew!!!!
America please vote for Angelica Hale, her voice\nis incredible.💜 She really wants this, and deserves it\nAmerica please VOTE for her. #AngelicaToWinAGT
I wish I could vote for Angelica (I live in England)
all i can say is PERFECT ♥
she really will be a super star.
This is why she's so good! She's a little girl and can sing like a superstar!! I'm SO glad she made it through! :DDD
She still looks like Lilo from Lilo and Stitch...
I guarantee 100% she is the winner agt 2017 💪💪💪💪💪
I know she's going to win ❤
She is so cute and such a good singer I watch her all the time
Been cheering for this kid since auditions! Slay princess!
this one young lady can touch my heart. go ahead and keep up the good work. goodluck and good hunt.
Does Tyra make anyone else want to jump off a bridge?
That whistle tone!!! She’s such an amazing singer
Playing this over and over again.
She is too good.. Love u girl... you are Amazing
this little girl is going places. and it's obvious. gives me shivers every time
She's phenomenon at 10 young age, first & only the one best talent for AGT. Good luck to the final ANGELICA HALE. Your parent, family, friends, America and the whole wide world PROUD of you! Your angelic voice, sounds & shine the heart of the world.
Oh my gosh! just when I thought she couldn't top her last song...she TOPS IT! Chills! Looking forward to your singing career sweetheart :)
that...really wasn't great, I mean for a 10 year old sure, but it's america's got talent, not american children show promise but could still use a little work.
Goose bumps! But take annoying tyty out of the end
There she goes again, killing those notes and owning the song. Congrats Angelica!!!!
she sound great!!!!hope she win
I said wow\nAnd wow\nAnd WOW
Congrats Angelica Hale

without yow without yowwwwwwww
wow
Who got the chills #teamANGELICA ❤️
Yahoooooo!!!! Congrats!!! Angelica!!!! FINALS AGT!!!
Una voce bellissima...  Starei giorno e notte ad ascoltarla!
Her voice is grating. Whether she's 10 or 35, not a pleasure
very pitchy & bad phrasing. Nothing special. nothing new in her singing. same way ended the song with hit common head voice. just like in her previous performance. very predictable. 5/10
One of the worst covers for this song , smh
She is good, but I think the other young girl has way better abilities. This girl just feels more in my opinion.
Does she not speak English or have a lisp? Genuinely asking, her pronunciation of words sound funny. Sorry, I've never seen the show
talking about overated.
Angel for the final sing and i am telling you the winning piece
it is impossible for her to win, the difference of talent levels with the girl Darci, is too big, she is only competing for second place
There's always a Asian better than you
I'm a bit disapointed with her choice of song this time its current but i didn't relate with her emotionally but she's still good ...
She'll be deported before the finals
I hope she doesn't win. Not hating it's just she has an unfair advantage compared to other contestants. People like cute things. People will always vote for cute things even if they do bad. I hope preacher wins!
Nicki's a tired act now. Should've got *Amber Rose.* For just the video I mean. Amber behind the wheel of a slick ride should be the expected sort of scantily clad female eye candy in these sexy types of music videos.
Did she name drop Seth rogan as Seth ro?
Hello guys I just wanted to say that I do song covers on my channel, in case you're interested…I'm having some issues right now, but I will get back on track soon, hopefully…Sorry for the self-promotion, when you're a small channel it's pretty hard getting your content out there…Thank you from Italy :) <3
Go back to the Black Eyed Peas fergie...
Inspiration from Madonna's Die another day? Fergie = musically irrelevant as always.
Black latex outfits reminding me a little of the Madonna Human Nature video...
I love Nicki and Fergie, but this song is so cringe, it makes Vanilla Ice look like James Dean.
nicki's verse should put in when the song is about to end like 2 verse before so this song is not boring eitherway, well done tho
I'll be honest, though I love both artists, this song has some weird pacing issues and doesn't seem that radio friendly
This song makes me feel like I’m a somebody
Is there a song where nicki is not featuring?
Love it. Fergie gets down like herself. She isn't TRYING TO BE BLACK when she raps. She always had a funky flow.
Can I get some likes for no reason
The first few verses sound like Aluna George in you know you like it
Most clothing Nicki has ever worn on a video 😜
FERGIE IS FUCKING BACK YALL I'M SO READY FOR THIS ALBUM
What a montage of ripped off shit.
Eww Fergie stay away from the high notes or use autotune lol
I wish there was a list of what artists wear and where you can buy the clothes.
I don't like this very much.
oh come on fergie.. you can do better....
I know u fucking lying FERGIE is that bitch dnt u forgot 😍😍😍😍
Nicki with a lot of Clothes 😲 Wow
I don’t love Nicki but this is a good collaboration.
i came here for Nicki Minaj but second girl is also disaster wow.
I see this song in the background of tv commercials like target/jcpenny
Probably the most appropriate thing Nikki has everrr worn 😂
That little pat she did at 1:51 with that face KILLED me
GARBAGE!!!!! another mid 2000 artist that flops nasty....Internet wins again ur industry is dying
does she try to be madonna?
The look at 1:10 is FIRE
who's else there just for Nicki😍😍😍
whos this old bitch ?? she should be retired lmao
Wait nicki Minaj was actually present at the shoot???
uhhhh what's up with songs like look what you made me do swish swish bish and this???  just so quiet?? it's almost just a voice. all it has is a subtle beat. there's no build-up and its just boring imo 😒
Honestly no... if it wasn't for nicki this wouldn't even make it in the radio.
Fuck Justin he would not take a pic with a disabeld person
can't believe she's 40 years old
This is actually pretty good
Some women really get super hot in their 40s. I'm pretty damn jealous of her husband....
Surprised the made a vid for this. Tbh. Whiskey
Wow this is so bad
I like fergie, but this song is so boring
These women are straight working🤹‍♀️
Tell me I am not the only one thinking she looks more and more like michelle pfeiffer?
I like this!!! Go Fergie, so much better than MILF loving this jam. 💛😏💛
this is 90's, this is fashion, this is quality...my GOD\n\n a breath of originality . uff FERGIE this IS you \nand Nicki amazing see you dressing
Her voice isn't Auto tuned and it's great
I really hope this song make it into the top 10 😊😊
the most normal 'rap' scene with nicki in a while
Who's here because of Seth Rogens tweet? Lmao
Make sure to  mute the volume from 0:00 to 4:16 to reduce the chances of your ears bleeding
This sounds exactly like 'You Know You Like It' by Dj Snake.
Every song Nicki Minaj is in These bitches is my sons
Lyrics from Warm It Up Kane, Set It Off,  and beat by Rob Base & DJ EZ Rock - It Takes Two
It's so bad.
Tbh this is too repetitive and boring\nI don't hate Fergie, but in my opinion I don't like this song
I'm here before 1,570,00 views!!! REMEMBER ME!!!
not even queen nicki could save this song
Fergie the queen is back!!
im only here for nicki minaj
Nicki here is so herself❤

DAAAAAMN SHE IS HOT
Pensé que era #CaraDelevigne & la segunda parte de su video I FEEL EVERITHNG 😏
Both are ugly DISGUSTING cunts with no talent
It took 4 mins to bring Thom to level 1.
Waiting someone to upload the lyrics 😂😂
1:38 isn't that a reference to Just?
creativity mode: OFF\nThe scenario for the clip has been stolen from here https://youtu.be/9JkjupxFCe4?t=17
Looks like the idea is stolen from the great Russian group The Time Machine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JkjupxFCe4
Wow, that's just awesome artwork ! One of their best video from my perspective do you agree guys ?
Always a favorite of mine, I love this song.
I would've raged and taken the stairs.
This sucks ! High and Dry is better than this one....
what kinda jacket is that? anyone know?
Thom's lift is in a building designed by Kafka.
The 'lift' is probably a metaphor of life. \nLike the people we come across in our lives, each heading to their own destinations. Each of them sharing moments with us, however temporary it may seem. Some people (like the old man who misses the lift) could have been have a part of our lives, if time wanted them to be so, or sometimes we neglect the chance to let them in. \n\nWonderful video!
teacher of the indie rock
Are there any radiohead fans from India here?
That ending got me so good
One Russian famous band already did it in 2001, guys >< https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JkjupxFCe4
not gonna lie I never liked radiohead
I loveee radiohead
He's daydreaming that a paranoid android has their knives out killing weird fishes. The karma police are now burning the witch while a creep is hunting bears. The man of war was a talk show host. No surprises. A lotus flower grew in a field with permanent daylight and fake plastic trees. The killing cars sail to the moon as a wolf at the door sends the daily mail. Dollar and cents, that is how I made millions.
I paused porn to watch this
But the elevator is not worthy
Pretty relieved they went with the original arrangement and didn't try some  bullshit of reworking it in to another downtempo synth driven piece.
Thx for the visit i guess..
1:40 I think those bald men should be taking about the yuppies networking from paranoid android or even a reference from fake plastic trees shaving a bald head
I haven't started listening to the song yet but the 100/1 ratio of likes and unlikes has made my hopes really high for this song.
A man doomed to ride an elevator that stops on every floor; only to reach the ground floor and have to start over again.. for all eternity. 2017 horror film of the year: Lift.
Not so strange that no one has a clue, but mysterious enough to keep us coming back for more.
1:39 people of kendrick's humble mv
The ting with Radiohead, is that it gets directly to your soul, even if you didn't have one to begin with.
4:3 is the new black & white?
I think that the video is stronger than the song and would work on its own better especially by adding dialogue, but they wouldn't ever let us do that. I guess it's an old song so the video is the point.
wow, they still got it. I'll leave my favorite radiohead song here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kG-eyxkGPf8
This is just raw footage of Thom's daily routine what the hell
Ha ha drinking goldfish water, i did that once
Thom's like Great. Now my ice cream is gonna melt...
I love you Thom
This video is a tribute to the lives lost September 11, 2001 and all the brave men and women who died of illness years after participating in the rescue and recovery effort.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zz11ZTB9Mdg\n\n#Don't forget 9/11\n\n#Radiohead FAN
у британцев уже нет мозгов своих. плагиатом занимаются...\nфууу,как некультурно!\nthe British no longer have their brains. plagiarism is engaged ...\nfuuu, how uncultured!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfnKsyxE6q8
Radiohead сняли супер клип и песня отличная! и да, вопреки утверждениям Макаревича, у которого похоже либо старческий маразм, либо оппозиция головного мозга, ничего общего с клипом Машины нет. Ну да, лифт, и что? он что приватизировал использование лифтов в клипах? короче, клип Машины - самобытный, интересный и для 2001 года снят просто потрясающе, как по мне, у Radiohead - самобытный, интересный, потрясающий клип. Но вот хайпиться не надо, Андрей. From Russia with love!Radiohead forever!))
Тот момент, когда в России, смотря клип, негодует один Андрей ^_^ Всё новое это хорошо забытое старое.
Макаревич, видимо, даже не задумался, что англичане могут не знать кто он такой и не догадываться о его клипе. Что-то совсем уже тронулся старый пердун
Plagiarism of video машина времени место где свет. Check it on youtube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JkjupxFCe4\nи ведь правда похоже на плагиат или не?
Tired and uninspired. They somehow managed to make a ride in the lift MORE boring.
people who hate radiohead are very dumb and stupid FACT
Roses are Red. Violets are Blue, Thom Yorke being on an elevator is more interesting than you.
Best notification I've recieved in the entire day. <3
These OK Computer B sides have got me listening to Airbag/How Am I Driving? Again. Best B side album ever! Also gotta love Follow Me Around.

Like a flashback to 03/04 😂
So many underestimate 50s intelligence, he's so aware of everything around him. Just listen to the way he break everything down. Respect bruh
damn how old is he? does he even age?
50 was too good for Interscope. Dude put out 2 legendary albums GRODT and The Massacre they still owe 50 big time IMO
Great how Fif points out how all these radio guys like Ebro talk S*** about everyone but keep sucking Jay Z balls,Charlemagne does same too
Great interview. If you have some time, I have a Rap single that I think can put me into the Industry. If you guys have time, type in Enzo - Count in the search bar and let me know what you think! I appreciate and love all of you!Thumbs up for Hip Hop.
thats where its at gladiator \nor is this just bearly coming out\n  about the deal \n  i fucks wit  fifty\n ,my explicits were in that direction\n  at the begining to em \n nothing against him or the camp\n im just tryna learn it and put the game on clamp\ni just aint wit none of that bs\nmake $ live life make music
Ebro will beat 50 in a fight, 50 only makes records about being gangster but that's as far as his gangster image goes, that's why 50 is a fan of ctg because they both run when they're confronted on the streets
50 one of the only real Niggas left in hip hop
Did they want 50 to change who he is, a man/gangster, the last of a dying breed just for NY Hip Hop? Squares like Ebro can never understand 50's divide and conquer mindset and condition, he's a G to the bone.
26:50 is where it gets Real
New York as a whole fucking let everybody takeover not fifty
50 is the REALIST nigga in the industry
50 is one of the smartest dude I'm still surprised he isn't head of a label or some kind of boss.   But he do whatever he want
He had to get them then he gave us a classic on The Massacre: PIGGY BANK
When is someone gonna slap this shit out of ebro!
50 one of the GOATs
Prodigy and Tupac were very similar. They really art students that took on the theme thugging
Hot 97 is garbage and I'm only here for 50.
Don't really care to watch this whole thing, but I will gleam the comments to get a summary ;)
So because the business people felt it was messy in NY yall refuse to play the other artist music in NY who had hot songs & was not involving in the 50/ja rule mess. So u went to so call break outter state records that was already hot 🔥 in 47 to 30 states. AND blame 50cent. Your the program director you know who's hot in the streets of new york. You could have push state property bleek fab etc... Insteed of fat joe lox & ja rule.
“ There really art students that took on the theme thuggin “. Love watching interviews of 50.
Trump switched it up on people, people never knew he was That guy until he got in office. I on the other hand always suspected it.
Rosenberg is such a dick rider....... tell him how you really feel about 50 central and how you said he has no talent
I bumped the massacre so many winters... its very under rated
See what he had to say about 50 and if Hip Hop is done with him? Listen to An Honest Conversation About Hip Hop Episode 10 by An Honest Conversation About Hip Hop Podcast #np on #SoundCloud\nhttps://soundcloud.com/ahcahhpodcast/an-honest-conversation-about-hip-hop-episode-10
I'm tired of this osama bin laden looking motherfucker Ebro using the word nigga. \n\nNigga you ain't black, don't try fit in where you don't belong...... \n\nbitch ass nigga
50 is one of the smartest niggas out in the industry .. Don't judge a book by its cover. No one can touch this man
i think Fif likes Ebro coz hes the only one of these radio guys that aint afraid of him
50 wearin the same shit he just bunched two interviews back to back what a boss
50 do big business gotta luv the strategy!!!! He said he wanted to do film now top show in the land!!! Melaninated  business moves!!
This is the first time i see 50 cent crying. RIP Prodigy
50 cent the drug dealer from queens turn down 500,000$ for a walk through from trump..... That's Morals
50 I'm next good one
thanks 50 for REALLY PULLING Ebro coat! YOU ARE THE BEST!
HANDS DOWN One of the best people in the world.. This negro I dont kno how to not respond to someone trying to hurt me ....So ima start hurting people. Lmao thinking like my uncle ass nigha
what does 50 mean when he says hiphop is a youth culture?
tom ford is my subscribtion
This nigga be saying a whole lot of nothing
Fiddy is the definition of cool
first time listening to this radio show damn its entertaining , gracias.
Fifty I love you no homo but you always hating on Hov...
he drops gems. one of the best interviewees anyone can watch.
Ebro just shut the fuck up ..keep blaiming 50 for shit he never did.. It was you Radio DJ,s who stop playing real HIPHop and NY artist music.  50 Just a real Soldier and if its wartime  then ist wartime..but stop blaiming others u Prick.. I see now why Breackfastclub is wining over u suckerz.
why ebro trynna make 50 doing well into some bullshit about race. ffs man, you can tell 50 knows being a black dude doesn't make shit cos he's balling.
50 only dude who can go from nicest guy in hip hop to ready to fuck a guy up in the same interview and I believe he would do it.
I take it that 50 doesn't care for Puffy.
Rules for the NFL     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXK6MVbC-SE&feature=youtu.be
Ebro knows exactly what 50 was implying. It doesn’t matter how you personally gauge a hit a record. The question was simple “Who’s playing it now?” I liked the project but 50 is right this is a youth driven culture and the youth who is the main consumer is not consuming that project.
If you disliked this you a cunt!
I'm fuck them up hhahahahhaha
Ole ebro keep 50 ass on course let's  say that
50 Cent is the man. He gives the best interviews no matter what.
50 Cent always been hating on Jay Z and Diddy and always sounding like a Fox News reporter trying to explain himself.
rosenberg dont ever wear that chain again my nigga looking like a fob pablo miguel diaz
ok.. what's with the whole NY hiphop destruction ?? did they have a fight long ago ?? what are they talking about? someone ?
The Game Album, 1. I Am  2.Make a wish 3.take what you want. 4.Real Problems  5.Sleepless and alone 6. Crazy 7.Will he make it 8.Ha ha ha. 9. Hungry 10. Looks Like me Sounds Like me. 11. light another smoke. 12. Stay Stoned 13. Parrinoid And in pain
Watched every 50 cent interview this a brilliant business man much respect big homie
Keep 50 Alive. 50 was the last of hip hop, if you don’t get it. The fact that the industry started looking for OTHER rap after him. Then you see it
Why Ebro look like the defensive coordinator for the New England Patriots?
where is the middle of 50's mustache lmaooo
Peace in the name of Christ. Important: Can someone get the following short vid in front of Jay Z & his people.. https://youtu.be/pFb0Xu2xJYg
Rosenberg iced out now?
50 dropped serious knowledge on the rap game entertainment business and Ebro/Rosenberg tried to shit on it
Fif is ALMOST as good a troll as Trump. Lol Fif definitely is a lot funnier.
Lmao he is dumb. How do you not get the future line. He's saying he could've  ended up like that very easily and glad it didn't. That Ciara shit is a trash situation for a dude.
STACK BUNDLES was on his WAY! R.I.P. Ray Ray, I love ya my nigga and CHINX Drugz. SQ,SQ,SQ,SQ  SQQUUUAAAADDDDD UP!
Jay-Z ruined NY hiphop when he was president of DefJam...He promoted Rick Ross and Jeezy but shelfed all the NY artists.
Salute Curtis Jackson aka 50cent
Genius ass businessman right here.
IGNORANCE
@ 41:35 why Fifty clap like a seal lmao. Like a slow child
Legend
Nervous laughter all around lol
Did Fif really end NY rap?
I love fif!!!!
Much respect 50
Ebro cracks me up hahaha
Only watchn the shit cuz of 50. Idc bout these niggas
50!
Fif 👏👏
70 IQ people gathering...
50 has always been an entrepreneur. Businessman to the tee
50 the best at interviews.. I learn so much.. 💪😎👍💯💯💯
@ 27:09 shit had me crying
Great interview. 👌
Ebro is so fucking annoying
‘Hoe Culture ‘ I luv it lol

#WilDasovich I just want to tell you that I haven't been really active in youtube other than watching videos of cooking and camera reviews, yet after I heard about the news with your medical condition, I got so inspired by you that I immediately subbed and made sure that I get notified each time you upload a video. \n\nI wanna know how you are doing and how you are staying strong fighting against cancer. You have such a great family and you have such a great heart. You're happiness and positive energy is contagious, it manifests a lot in you.\n\nBy the way, when I heard about the RAWR Awards? I made sure to look for you and told my friends about it. You deserve so much more than just an award. \n\nKeep fighting Wil! We love you. 😘
pagaling ka tsong!

Drink salabat everyday, it is 1000x more effective than chemo
We could see it's not working. You still have your hair.
WILL BE D
Use cannabis man
Sub to my channel plss
Wil found your channel by accident.  Sending you prayers, light and strength. God bless you and your family. Keep up your incredible energy and positivity!!!!!
The extra boost of energy might be from the dexamethasone which is a steroid. \n\nLove your videos!
I'm so impressed that you'll keep your hands off the bike! Bike skills on fleek.
I love those words of wisdom about making the most of your energy when you still have it. Such source of positivity.
fight will, fight!  love your attitude. it's hard to be as peppy as you have been when you have cancer, but that's why i really love the way you've been dealing with this. attitude definitely helps. rest when you have to, but keep going at it will. fight!
They add steroids that wear off after a day.  I am in round 6.  Bit of drama.  The steroids are there to help you get through the first few days.   Not sure of all the exercise. You may want to check with the docs on alot of exercise.  The chemo eats protein.  Guess you will find that out.  I have managed to maintain my weight for 12 weeks.  Your immune system is dropping so watch any injury or infections.
glhf dude
DUN!!
Hi wil im 12 i watch you from phx az \nYou got 906k subs!!!!
Fight!
im gonna use the thumbnail as a meme for future purposes sjsksjsj
You are so inspiring and so positive! My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer (gleoblastoma) He had surgery in February, but sadly his tumor came back in the same spot a few months later (another surgery is not possible) Radiation, Chemo, and immunotherapy and his tumor has been shrinking! :) We have all been staying positive for my dad and getting him out of the house, and I think that has been helping so much. Praying for you and a fast recovery.
Energetic, happiness can kill your cancer Wil ;D
Wil, I hope you are healed soon!!!  I was thinking of you because of your senior porject :Marianne McGarry Wolf, Wil Dasovich, Mitch Wolf and Lindsey Higgins, When Choosing a Wine Label, Women are from Hollywood and Men are from Boston,   Selected paper prepared for the 2013 AAWE conference in Stellenbosch, South Africa. http://www.embassyconferences.co.za/media/Presentation%20Gender%20and%20Wine%20Labels.pdf\n\nI also have been into YouTube! Here is a viral video I made: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRdSWtUdawU Marianne
Make sure you're not gonna sweat a lot. Make your dressing dry and intact all the time to prevent infection. God bless you and you family!
Been following your battle.\nWas diagnosed last night with kidney cancer.\nHad no symptoms. Caught because I had a growth in my nostril which was thought to be inflamed scar tissue from a previous septi plast.\nSince the granulima was negative before surgery to remove it.They dbl checked ,Thank God.\nCat scan revealed whole body clear except a baseball sized tumor in my left kidney.\nRadical nephrectomy and chemo to follow.\nKeep posting your journey.\nGlad your Dad is a survivor.\nI pray you will be as well.\nGoid luck.\nPeace and health to you.
You mean chemo ADVERSE effects not working!! That title scared the shit out of me

Hey Wil, \nDavid here from The World n Us.  I'm a long time viewer, first time commenter.  We've just got back from camping for a few weeks to see what you've been going through.  Just wanted to send you some love from me and the whole family.  You are one person who has inspired me to start a channel and vlogging our family's travel experiences.  We just can't believe this is happening to you and want nothing more than for you to get through this.  Stay strong.  Take care of your body.  Get plenty of sleep.  We're here with you all the way!
the energy though! stay energize wil! 😍
love everything ma'am Chary does!!!
get well soon wil!!! You are a true inspiration!!! Godbless!!! Kamusta kay pudra, mudra and haley. :D
You are such a sweet son Wil. I love how you and your Dad are super close. And the way your Mom looked at you in the end, that was pure love. Stay strong Wil! A lot of people love you 🙂
Hi Wil,apparently you seem strong and composed on the outside,but given the situation you have many questions and apprehensions/doubts about life here and beyond.If you only turn to JESUS,HE IS our Healer and HE loves you and HE gave HIS own life to prove/show this, to remove the curse(which includes sickness) .JESUS is as close to you as your own breath in your lungs,if you ask HIM in prayer to heal you I GUARANTEE you HE wil .Because there is no record in the Holy Bible of JESUS turning down anybody who asked HIM for healing, and HE IS the same today,yesterday and forever(Hebrews 13:8).Ever a Loving,Merciful GOD/Healer.GOD BLESS Tremendously in JESUS name Amen!
Alodia in the end of the vid 😍

Someone should hook me up with some guitar tabs to match the vocal track. (Hope that makes sense)  I'm new at playing and can't play by ear yet so making my own tabs is a little difficult. Especially for something without traditional guitar.
I'm in love🙌🏼❤️💯

Make a hyper powered pizza cutter because I'm lazy
I found this video somehow and instantly fell in love, amazing videos :D.\nAlso I saw the cat tattoo on ye back and I thought to myself I need that
You and I both know that was incredibly hot. So easy to be nonchalant.
You're like the dorkiest mad scientist if I ever saw one
You should make an automated water bottle flipper
Can your laser boil water?\n\nIdk about you but laser ramen sounds good.

All of the food you have cut with the laser (looks like) it taste disgusting because everything just turns out burnt. So that made me think, what foods actually taste good burnt? Marshmallows.
Make bacon with a laser next please
I just spent more time watching a Shaw unlimited data plan ad than I did watching the video
The real question is can the laser do ASMR
i feel like this is what mark watney did after like 1 day on mars with too much equipment and 12 potatoe
William! I need a shirt! Some ruffian stole my plastic bag shirt and now I am nude.
You should  laser cut a laser pointer
Make grilled cheese with the laser

Ey, nice shirt. \nI’ve been binge watching your channel and was wondering: \nMy brother is making a prosthetic leg for a 13 pound turtle and he needs help. The turtle got attacked by dog and it’s front leg is now a stub. Do you have any suggestions about how to build it? \nBtw: cat shirt is in a making process!!
Why is your house only like one room
The ice/water dispenser on fridges should dispense milkshakes instead of water/ice.

When they were both in the ball together lmao!
I’m so proud of zoe for trying to zorb ball a few years ago she wouldn’t have even tried ❤️
I love Jim and Zoe's friendship it's like a really caring casual friendship and I'm in love x
I love these long vlogs, nice to see jim and tanya, there so nice,and joe of course x i think you,d suit an arran cardigan zoe x
I wish pumpkin picking & Halloween was a thing in Australia! 🎃 I'm in Canada this year so definitely going to vlog it!

Terry's orange chocolate is my absolute fave 😍
Please do a boots haul
7:34 - 7:43 innuendo bingo😂 xx
Zoe could you please do a wardrobe tour 😩😩
Imagine going to a party with all your colleges and do a quiz about the private life of your boss. That would be crazy!!!
Time spent with good friends is the best! Zoe, you were so brave going in the Zorb? ball
I've been using Clue for about a year now and it is honestly so useful!

Her secret project was she was hired  by the fbi to create sleep inducing ASMR so then can play it on loud speakers in Iran to sleep is is 2 death
OMG I LIVE IN LA CALIFORNIA!!!!!

I guess I can travel 8 hours from NorCal to Disneyland 🤷🏽‍♀️
You sound like you are from uk a littel bit.

Weird hearing her voice not whispered, sounds different
OMG THE ONE TIME IM NOT AT DISNEYLAND SHES THERE IM SO UNLUCKY\n\n\nEDIT: Wait is it bad I've watched her for a day and I do her intro with her?
Ayyyyyyyy  I was at LA in summer watching these vids. Welp I went there cuz I live in San Francisco.

진짜 볼빨간사춘기는 노래가 다좋은 것 같다\n막 기분이좋아지고 마음이 들뜨게된다❣️
볼빨간사춘기 목소리 너무 좋아
안지영 노래부르는 목소리는 정말 신이 내린거 같다. 웬간한 가수들 노래가 다 별로라고 느낄 정도임.
점점 둘의 격차가 커지는 것 같다.........
뮤비 귀엽게잘찍었다...\n하루에1번이상은보게되네
아 안지영 진짜 너무너므너무 이쁘더아아앙아아ㅏ아아아아
좋은 아침. 나는 작곡가, 가수 및 댄서입니다. 나는 곧 새로운 비디오를 제작할 것이다. 나는 혼자이고 그 노래는 한국어이다. 너는 나를지지 할 수있어. 고맙습니다.😊

Godson was there it was GG for him
Hi Supercell, I want you to make friendly challenge of builder base.So please think about it.
Dear Clash of clans\n\n     There's a bug inside of the game.In the news says the battle machine can be upgraded to level 15 but I saw in the top players their battle machine was level 20.
I like this game
Supercell there should be an option to buy another super builder
How do they matchup against each other on builder base?
Now I am hall 7
I want to see someone fall into the moat of the gaming platform...
You can see the constrenation on his face lol
Clash of clans \nvs\nClash Royale\nWhat is better
So there is no builder update. What's up with that.
Do you know SUPERCELL the leader of our clan is a girl!Our clan tag is #PP29RVUG
When were friendly battle come in builder base
1.27.05 didnt you have to switch up one army camp?
I thought connon see it would win
love the games supercell, but plz put brawl stars on Android
Please update the Pakistan flag
Hey clash! You should do somthing with ivory tower! Where you get wizards in the beginning of the game!
Please make COC for PC also
woah it was amazing! I really enjoyed this  XD
supercell there should be a friendly challenge in builder base just like friendly match in clash royale.
This coment section is pure cancer
Help me to grow my clan please  join \nTag=#U8U8YQ8G\nPlease  join
Godson is the best and he is on bh 7 and he is awesome
iTzU you're so cute. and good gamer. :)
Do another Clash a Rama but about P.E.K.K.A and mini P.E.K.K.A agruing about who's better
I just 3 starred a base with dragons. The dragons were only 4K elixir because of the event, same for the lighting spell. The base that I 3 starred had 1,100,000 elixir!\nThat’s what I call a “Positive elixir Trade”  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Clash of clans is my favourite game.Supercell can you give to me the Mega knight in clash royale
You guys can't attack properly I can 3 star that with ground attack😖😱😱😱😧😨😨
I like it thank for supercell
So is a Klaus a real life idiot? I think so. Makes it hard to listen when he talks. He makes himself sound like a retard child next to Galadon.
i got a puestion how to get in clash of clans get in private server pls answer me
suppercell.. please I will change my name..help me
You have to sup to keisuke he’s so FUNNY 😆
Hello

Por que no puedo jugar me sale descargando contenido
Porco dio ce un' italiano
#GP8VOPG COC players join us , we are a new war clan
the game did not load after the last update \nwhat is wrong with that ?
Thank you Sony! Best usage of money I've seen spent in 2017. You could easily fund a season or feature length anime and it would print money. I can't wait to see the new movie in October!
Excellent, they should do a full movie!
15 minutes..............I want more!!!! Superb!!!
Weyland, Yutani, Tyrell and Wallace.
Genialer Film, geniales Universum & sehr guter Tie-In. Freue mich riesig auf 2049!
LOVE THIS! WE NEED A FULL ON MOVIE.
How to get subtitles in English?
3:30 David Bautista
Damn that's great!
I read that the girl is supposed to be a prostitute. Interesting if not scary concept. Is it ethical to manufacture as a child to serve as a sex worker? Glad that they didn't do this in Westworld.
This was really good :-)
Now this is pretty cool!
Fanfkntastic !!! ....... I'd love to see THIS on the 'big screen' !!!
This is a masterpiece
There's some nice call backs to the original film, like the noodle bar at 11:48 with the neon dragon sign where Deckard was eating at the beginning of the movie.
What a tasty morsel!\n\nCross your fingers! My hope is that the anime master is up for The Animatrix Chronology and a story arc that spans nearly a thousand years.. that lead up to the 4th coming Matrix sequel that it draws from.
they should make this into a movie or a series
I expect nothing less from the director of cowboy bebop
our lord, the savior,deckard will save the world.
Good one)All praise to Denis and Co.
Beautiful!!!
capto la esencia de  Blade Runner.
Really awesome
9:06 Storm trooper accuracy.
MASTERFUL <3
Meh.
superb....keep this going!!!!
Brilliant work.
Wonderful 👏
... Bravo!...
thank you
Amazing
That was awesome!! More more more!!
meh
Epico!!!!!!!!!
So, why not just do the 9th Star Wars film like this?
Better 3d effects in a anime than the new berserker
I don't like the song of the credits, too much pop.
Great drawings but I feels like too pathetic for that girl fellow. Her poor acting made me uncomfortable to watch this movie.
if the new movie is even half as good as this, we're gonna be in for something breathtaking
that's shit. Disliked.
LOL - So Blade Runner is doing exactly the same thing that the Matrix did with the Animatrix - small vignette animation to fill in the timeline - and they end up pretty much the same plot point. Thank you for destroying my hopes for 2049 with the dated supremacist vibes.. and the jihadi nexus doesn't get blown up by the explosion?
Hey guys, I tried uploading this a few days ago, but had a technical fault - so had to remove it! If you're wondering why you've seen it before - you were in the lucky 1000 views previously! X
The fact that she drops everything just freaks me out 😂 no offense, love you em 💓
I thought this would be a fail for sure. Pretty cool. Definitely would be hard to get even I think
Cara delevingne brows right there
Love your vids. This one is super quiet though :/ no hate! Just didn't know if you were aware. :)
Keep this background pls
I just love how clumsy you are and so jumpy. So cute! Love your chanell btw!
I love the fact that now she smiles alot in the videos 😍😍\n. Yes.. that brow stamp .. nailed it 😍
These brows look SO good on you!! No one has perfectly matching brows so no one would give yours a second look. We are our own worst critics - but this looks really, really good. Like, I want to try it now!!!
could u do a full face of elf i know that you done a full face of drugstore with some elf products in but could you do a full face if that possible? btw i luv ur channel :)
Wow I think you actually look good with the thicker brow! AND I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT TO WORK THAT WELL. Thanks for another awesome video, Em! 💖
looking forward for u to review some stuff from makeup revolution....
you are the cutest person I have _ever_ seen, watching your videos makes me gay - never thought this would happen to me.
This actually looks surprisingly good! I mean, if you stamp them on in 3 seconds, you can touch them up quite a bit and still save time. Cool! 💕
```    ```
wanna reach 500 subs can u help a sis out ^_^ have a good day:-)
your videos make me so happy ♡♡♡
That eyebrow is going to be walking 2 paces ahead of the rest of my body! HAHAHA! You are amazing and hilarious! <3
U need to spend 3 weeks on them  brows lol
Hi have you tried the foundation from dermacol ?
Plzzz change ur name from my pale skin to beautiful me coz u look so beautiful
What foundation are you wearing here. Your skin looks great
Try the EgoEra facial mask maker. It looks interesting.
Actually this is intriguing! I'm missing half an eyebrow from a dog attack if this would work then it would save me so much time everyday having to completely draw on my brow from scratch and having to match it to the other. Does anybody know how pigmented the powder is on just plain skin???
Your reactions was so funny! I tried it on my mother but oh no, it wasn't so pretty lol
You're always dropping things 😂 \nLove your videos ♥️
your mazing and make my day your so funny! ENERGY. BUT can we get fall makeup LOOK?! OR NO..AND look idk stamp hmm how make eyebrows perf lmaooo did , OTHER HACKS instgram hype lol no missed video so new! TROOPER MOTIVATION GREAT . what foundation using?!
I love this!  I'm going to have to try it.  I would love to see a tutorial on your makeup look in this video!
You're the only person I've seen who didn't completely miss their brow when using this product!!
Yes I‘ve seen this video a few days ago😂
Brow stamp pretty cool....what eye shadow are you wearing it's lovely!!!
Love the video! So happy you finally uploaded this video!
I feel like you already did this before! Dejavue. Just like the video where you tested the Derma-high-coverage foundation! :D
I thought that only i have got one easy-brow and one hard-brow x)
I really like the thicker brow on the left.
Hey !! Just one suggestion- start giving marks out of 10 to the products u review. That would be good. Love your videos. :*
I CANT BELIEVE YOUR GOING TO HELLOWORLD ARGH I AM SO EXCITED
I think this could actually work for me!? Still better than doing it all with my clumsy hand! LOL :D
The product is pretty good may try it myself 😊
Not lucky one... Wish I could 😨😞
I literally just watched reaction time react to your pale skin video about how you are ugly your such an inspiration and continue to do what you are doing 🙂
I Need that! 😳
Does anybody prefer the harder brow
Awesome video!!!!
👍👍👍👍👍
Here before 3k views !

They look so good!! I literally do my brows in 5 seconds for each lol
First comment!!!!! Love your videos they are so inspiring!

OMG you totally nailed it Em!!! 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌👏👏👏👏👏😘😘
First comment mother frickerrr
It looked great on you!! Wow! 👌🏼
Try rolling the stamp so it get the whole brow
I am pleasantly surprised at the results. Good job!
I am genuinly so surprised at how they came out! Brow game on point!
I love the harsh brow look on you
Super love your review always. ❤️ #notifsquad
I'm such a fannnn 💕
why don't you just fill in your brows like a normal person... this would probably make my brows really uneven! lol (if i do it)
Hugh, went str8 to hell..
dead. good. should have died along time ago. a disgrace to us men & manhood who respect women.  he was a piece of rubbish. good riddance.
Died with his dick in some underage girl. Nasty prick.
He died doing what he loved...looking at and fucking women
At least Hell has one less vacancy
I'm sorry but I cannot mourn the death of a man who spent most of his life objectifying women... he was a nasty nasty man...
Can't say his in a better place now....
Ya sex sells for whores not for decent women  who work hard and are pillar of this society so fuck him
It is real. Look up what i told you to
Its all well and good talking mostly about the ILLUSION of 'women's choices' back then but the topic to me should have been W---H---Y HEFNER 'EMPOWERED' WOMEN (if you think that) or WHY HEFNER OBJECTIFIED WOMEN (if you think that). It appears the answer is the same - HEFNER 'USED' WOMEN FOR WEALTH and 'USED' WOMEN FOR HIS OWN SELF/SEXUAL GRATIFICATION! True no one forced any of those women but If a young woman you know CHOSE to sell her body in any way, would you 'empower' her by encourageing her to go ahead or would you 'empower' her with other options? EMPOWERMENT IS NOT EMPOWERMENT WITHOUT CHOICE. You are only 'empowered' according to your options and BAD CHOICES dont quate to being 'EMPOWERED'. Understand the definitions people. Are they telling me women had NO OTHER options back then? If there were no choices back then, how were they being empowered? More like sold the idea of it! (Talk about piss on my leg then tell me its raining). If Hefner empowered women, why was HE the one who had the most power overall? HE benefitted the MOST according to his assets! I wonder how many women he DISSUADED from prostitution regardless it was thier choice? How many non sexual women's issues did he give charity or support to? How many instances did he lend his support to that did not include sexual revelations to men or women? \nA black or latino or asian man would never get kudos with the same legacy as they would be called a PIMP or in a woman's case in the same position- a MADAM! Yet another example of America's double standards and blind existence of WHITE MALE priviledge! It was called Playboy Mansion because the owner was white and a male who knocked champagne glasses with the likes of. It would have been called a brothel if it were owned by a female or brothel if the owner was non white period. I love Whoopy but on this occasion, a woman taking 'her destiny in her own hands' should benefit her. Sure they chose to be bunnies ect but they were NOT empowered. A suicide victim does not 'empower' themselves when they CHOOSE to kill themselves nor do they benefit for the sake of taking 'thier desitiny in thier own hands'. In the same vein, STOP excusing Hugh Hefner's prolonged sexual deviance as EMPOWERMENT towards women. His empire was called PLAY'BOY' - the empowerment of boys and men NOT WOMEN. STOP with the praising of this man
RIP Mr.Playboy! old man sucks by the way, i am really happy about his death, ugly skinny cunt he was i believe! RIP Mr. playboy! take care, bye bye XD Playboy sucks! I'm sitting here at home all day, playing video games.this playboy dude was a muppet innit?  You know what i'm sayin'??????????ooppsss look at that  i just farted....fucking hell...stinks really bad dude
Should you HATE Hugh Heffner? THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS DEATH.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESrCFrStey4
RIP SATAN is waiting in hell for you
Rest in Peace Mr Hefner.  Thank you for all the awesome years of Playboy. You are a Legend.
He saw more titties than anyone on the planet
I'm so sad for Hef, he a great Playboy king, he gets golden.
More like hugh just left heaven.
RIP Hef the King of Playboy
And life goes on.............
Rip! A Playboy bunny tattoo now for me 😎
All these feminist in the comment section lol 😂
Huh well that sucks for the people that loved him. But since I never knew him well you went down as you lived as a playboy.
Rest In Peace Hugh he having good time with Satan or Heaven party like a legend.
People often say that those who have dies are in a better place. This will not be said for him.
About the only thing worse than this perverted bastard is the moral-less, classless, clueless, nasty ass bunch of tramps who sold their soul right along with Hugh.. For broad is the path and wide is the gate that leads to destruction, and many will enter in..
He was a degenerate
All you Christian feminazis need to shut your fucking mouth and show some respect to someone that just died you immoral scum.
whats with the sad music in the background.........
HE is burning in HELL for his wickedness!!!!! He was a key figure in the moral decline of our society he was a filthy wretch!!!!!
rest in peace hugh hefner your playboy products and tv show will continue to live on thanks for all the wonderful things you did for us men and woman bout makeing woman all over the world look more beautiful with their skin as well as thier clothing go in peace my friend my heart goes out to the hefner family and i hope hefner  legacy will continue to live on
The excess Viagra moved beyond his penis and throughout his body causing one big stiffy.
Back in the summer2016  went highland I saw a girl  wearing playboy playmate she had big boobs and my November trip to Las Vegas I saw hot womens strip clubs and wow rest in peace Hugh Hefner
Christian warns Hugh Hefner before his death to repent and believe the gospel...NOW HE IS IN HELLFIRE ! https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=40&v=6vKw7kp-vIg
Wow, the hell wait for hugh, burn forever.
THE GUY WAS A WALKING AND TALKING CORPSE BEFORE HE EVEN DIED.....I WOULD THINK THAT WOULD SPEAK FOR ITS SELF BUT YOU PEOPLE LIKE TO DEFEND WALKING AND TALKING GHOSTS.
In honor of Hugh, everybody give their wife or girlfriend a nut shot in the face tonight  !
at least they no longer have to suck his old dry dick
He got all that pussy back then!!
if you die a millionaire...youre probably going to...oh hell no! where you have to eat second rate pussy! and the women have semi non semetrical breasts! an alternate universe where donald trump is fred durst and fred durst is ted nugent...and where athletics are forced upon all people..even jumping jacks....and none of the women have blonde hair! none! but thanks to technology that world is made of plastic...the sex toy industry has officially secured hell...so he probably went to italy.
his penis will be missed
Has any of his women died?
He made the world worse made it disgusting
I actually hate cringey feminists but everyone knows God doesn’t want him
Straight to hell where he deserves to be :(
This man is *not* living in a better place. Where do you go from here? He hit his peak after 91 years
1926? dang I bet he kicked it with Charlie Chaplin
I just got a commercial for the movie Happy Death Day like way to go YouTube! Great timing!
People some loved him and some people hated him. That is the Hugh Hefner legacy. I'm sorry for his family loss. His name will live on.
Everyone saying R.I.P,  no he's not resting lol
R.I.P. HUGH HEFNER 1926-2017 \nYOU'LL WILL FOREVER BE MISSED. THANK YOU, GOD BLESS YOU & FAREWELL MY FRIEND! 😢😢😢😢😢😇😇😇😇😇
For all y'all religious ppl saying he will burn in hell are ridiculous y'all act like y'all know what this man did in his entire life to help the world in any way he probably did way more than you fake ass christians ever did have any of yall donated before? What about help someone through college, the poor and homeless??? All y'all do is point y'all figures I pray y'all religious beliefs become y'all reality after death just like the Bible sayhe who cast the first stone shall be judged first so  I pray y'all be judged for every rock thrown yall toxic judgemental human beings clean your own shit first then worry about others Ike your preachers who's molesting children and stealing money which in my eye  is much worst than Hugh Hefner 🤷🏽‍♂️
From these comments I can see why women are becoming more feminist.
Rip legend 😭😇
and busting hell wide ass open.
Died from massive erection
Helped bring porn mainstream. RIP
HILLARY 4 PRISON
R.I.P. HEF
died on hump day..lol.isnt that ironic
😿☠️
LARRY KKING TWEETED\nHE WAS A SEXY ICON
To hell
Why are there 30 dislikes?
#RIP Big Man! 😭🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻😭😭😭💋💋💋💋💋 #HughHefner
Dirty old man!
Icon.
What a life!!!
RIP
RIP The G.O.A.T
now burn in hell
Rest in hell
Hugh Marston Hefner WAS NOTHING but a pimp.
Good riddance freak. Burn Hefner Burn
So many Feminists and Christanists in this comment section celebrating. \nNo wonder why your hero Hillary Lost!\n(Not a Trumpeter, I don't like him either).
Mixed feelings rest in peace
No way you can say he’s going to a better place because he was in a better place at the playboy mansion.
Rest easy brother ill take over from here ;)
Nobody can say he's in a better place
It's about time, women are better off without him. He will now answer to God for his continued sinful ways.
The world is better off without him.
Wonder if he went to hell. He was a womanizer. I went to his old high school in Chicago graduated in 2009. The principal swore he donated a million to the high school she must of spent the cash on herself because nothing was updated at the school.
Pornography can lower the sense of self-esteem and self-worth of the wife because she may compare herself to the women that her husband is viewing on the screen.  She sees it as a slippery slope to addiction. It may also lead to an increase in the progression of rougher or more deviant sex. This contributes to the husband becoming more focused on his needs and not those of his wife.\n\nAll of the experts agree that a detachment of emotion during sex, and detachment from the relationship as a whole, is very dangerous to the viability of the marriage. Pornography is a poor substitute for the bonding version of sex.
*REST IN PUSSY*
His soul will not be resting. Hope he repented.
This man enjoy every day of his life!!! My condolences to relatives....
Jesus he sexualize women and other women believe they had to be perfect. Because of Playboy many women got plastic surgery porn got more and more popular it was just ridiculous. He's a pervert
RIP, Hef. You will\nbe sorely missed.
R.I.P Hugh \n\n\n\n\n\nHe will never be forgotten.
A great man died
Any libshit on here who praises this man and condemns Trump for equivalent behavior is the biggest hypocrite on the planet. Further proof that liberals are animals.
Rest In Peace you lucky bastard! You will be missed!
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
And are we sad about this
This comment section is full of a bunch of cucks, and fat ugly bitches who get no sex. I have nothing but respect for the man he achieved his dreams despite criticism and controversy. He made a fortune and slept with beautiful young women. RIP Hugh.
So heartbreaking
Finally old fart
Yuck
FUCK HIM\nBLOODY PERVERT
R.i.p
I need someone to formally educate me cause I see a lot of negative comments. Did Hugh abuse the women he worked with, or something bad? Because to say he deserves to rot in hell just because he's the founder of playboy is not reasonable at all.

OMG !!!! Yes, please !!! Jonathan and Nancy are perfect together !!! Netflix itself ships it !!! There is STILL HOPE !!!! Please get together this season !!!
Damn excited for Season 2 ... can’t it come quickly.??!!! Plzz share a new trailer!!
Since this footage was shot on red, I think the footage was ran through a vhs cassette to make it look more 80s and 90s style with the music.
DUDE IM SO HYPE FOR THIS! YAY WOOOEEEHHH!! I HAVE WAITED FOR 5 MONTHHHHSS! When is it coming out?!
This is not stranger things.. is this trailer a joke about the show? Wtf
Some people's OTP is Mileven or Jancy. But the ultimate couple by far is DEMOPAPA
I ship the three of them lmao
What day does it release?
I miss mileven give me some mileven \n\n\nI’ll pay you
I love this kinda throwback trailers with this 80s vibe. Good job Netflix, you really put me in your 80s STRANGER vibe.
That triangle tho and rip best friend
So is Jancy happening or what..... PLEASE
wow netflix is really coming though with the ships
Honestly - Bless you for making this. Can't wait to see their relationship blossom in season two!
They should do the entire second season with these VHS effects
When does season 2 come out?
imagine thinking this is true. Jancy 4 life.
Okay this video is great but wtf is the thumbnail? 😂😂
i just hope they don't make nancy and jonathan a thing. 😕\ni was so glad this show didn't follow that girl-dates-a-popular-guy-but-suddenly-she-fallsinlove-with-that-weird-guy overused plot.
???????? What the hell is this shit??????
I am so weak for this <3 Netflix ships it!!
Why did this make me cry
Steve and Nancy are a beautiful couple!  And he even helped them in the end against the monster..
Wait, did Netflix just make a fan video of their own show???
Can we please get a version of the show in this filter!??? Make it happen Netflix.
This came out 1year ago and I still haven't watched it.
Let's face it, what we all really wanna focus on is eleven and mike's romance in this season/show.
If nancy and johnathon get together il kill myself cya
I ship Nancy and Eleven 😊
Is it just me or the one that Elle Mills made was so much better
Like So 80s Man. Can we call it Strange Love???\nAny way the trailer Rocks and one more month left for Season 2!!!
These characters are my favorite part of Stranger Things. Just set this to some 80's music - Tears for Fears or something. :)
Come on October 27th. I can't wait to watch one of my favorite Netflix shows
IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE A HINT THAT THE LOVE TRIANGLE GETS REAL NEXT SEASON. Because Hopper and Joyce is where the real action is. damn.
*Beginning: He was a jerk.* \n*Ending: He was my favorite supporting cast.*

So excited to see them lose there shit from Trump winning again in 2020. Lol
Women now have bigger balls than men. lol what a time to be alive!
Oklahoma needs a team !!! We’ll take 2 !!!!  Best hits this century!!
The NFL can go rot. I won't watch it again until I see official apologies from every player, coach and owner....and Goodell had to apologize in a press conference and then resign
LFL about to get popular, fuck the NFL
Finally, some football players with balls!
I guess I WILL be watching football...  Just not thr NFL.
They act more like men than the pussy NFL players with their fe fees.  Thx LFL.  Subscribed.
Thank you ladies. I left the nfl, coming to you. The Flag and National Anthem should never be disrespected. Thank you!!!!
Looks like I just became a fan!! Great job lady's. Support you all the way!
As of this posting 228 communist pigs have watched this video.\nPatriots, give this video a thumbs-up!!!
How come this is the first I've heard of this League?????   When do they play !  Now this is football !  Patriots, each an everyone !
I think it would be nice to see the LFL go more mainstream in place of the NFL. They deserve it!
RIP NFL
America !  haters gona hate...
Well I'm switching to the LFL...and good for them. The women play a better, harder hitting game too !
You summed it up perfectly. Honestly, I never heard of LFL before seeing this video.\nYou ladies just gained a new fan.
hey NFL take a look at your replacements! Ironic that these ladies have more cojones than the so called men of the NFL (No Fans Left)
It's unnessary to undermine the real fight against police brutality.
PEAK IDEOLOGY
😮, 🙄, 😁😃😄😍🇺🇸🇺🇸🎆🗽
Man, sometimes it sucks to be gay.
Thank you LFL! Sure wish the National Felons League had your guts.
You know what's more disrespectful to or American flag? The confederate flag.
Can I identify as a woman and play in this league?
Hell yeah!
Ahh Football without the protests!!! I'm in!!
I guess the only league game I will watch from now on. Salute you all.
The greatest country, huh!? Without own history.
It's just comical that this was all started by a one season wonder qb who was raised by a white couple in Wisconsin.
They should replace the  NFL with the LFL, Why would you rather watch men tackling each other when you can watch women tackle each other in their underwear.
If we disrespect the flag and our institutions we open the door for Communism and loss of our freedoms, we must never let that happen. Cultural Marxists are working patiently and steadily at destroying our institutions, most are not as obvious or as well publicized as the kneeling issue but they are just as important. To understand what is happening here see YouTube videos on The Frankfurt School and Cultural Marxism this will let you see the grand plan to destroy our country and way of life.
Get a team in philly and I will get season tix! Good for you ladies, I stand with you
Why doesn't the LFL not have their own superbowl yet?
Women aren't equal either,  they should be protesting as well.
To be honest I must be living in a bubble because I have never watched this football league here but I respect them so much more then I do the NFL players now. Thank you ladies for being tougher and more patriotic then these coward NFL players and owners.
Subbed.
The people have the balls to stand for their own country, oh wait they don't have balls.
and yet somehow the dislikes are super high . I do not believe people actually dislike this stance the LFl is taking and trolls have infected the dislikes on this channel post .  People who support the flag of this country make sure to hit like to stop the losers who think it is cool to disrespect our nation and its symbols!  LFL football sounds like a gimmick but watch a game and you'll see more than just sexy women in pads ! This is really football and it's a pretty good football game  to watch and the women are beautiful on top of that .  They hope to reorganize my Green Bay Chill and I hope we get that team back on the field soon because with the NFL screwing us over Wisconsin is looking for another football team to back !
MLAR
You just improved your stock market value by double digits!  A CLASS ACT, for sure!
lfl should be come America sport
Please!!! Have games at the same times as the NFL!!
Any LFL player, no matter how good or sexy, who refuses to salute the flag or national anthem should be banned.
LFL Rocks - The men from the NFL should be humbled by your patriotism and honor you give your nation.  Thank you!
I live in Scottsdale Arizona and would definitely support an AZ team if they eventually have one.
You guys are great! If you ever have a game in Tennessee I'll be there or better yet maybe start a team in Tennessee!
They got bigger balls than the NFL pussies
I support you even more for this, but unfortunately their are a lot of Anti-American people, who think protesting the Flag that give's them the right to protest, will do something good, it won't, it will just destroy the county that gave them that right in the first place, and then they'll have nothing.
🚀
FOR AMERICA
LOVE this! Very well done LFL.
It's amazing how everyone is an American until they bare their right to freedom of speech then all of a sudden they are not Americans anymore. Nice.
Thank you! I greatly appreciate the respect that you show for our flag, and those who have fought to defend it. You are now my football league of choice.
When the LFL is more legit then the NFL.
Thank You LFL.
Good job ladies!
ok! i'm in, what channel?
TRUE PAYTREEUTS
I'd watch it!
This is the best timeline
I'm more of a rugby guy, but I wouldn't mind watching this. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Now this is a league I could support & games I could watch.
I Stand with the Lovely/Athletic Ladies of the LFL....Yeah Buddy!!!
So these ladies have bigger balls than all those kneeling NFL boys.
yeah fuck the nfl this is the brilliant
Are the 220 thumbs down by the NFL Snowflakes who kneeled? #BoycottNFL #BoycottNFLSponsors
This is great news least these woman show love for this country unlike those fuckers in the NFL. Much love to you lady's and thank you.
I'd rather watch these girls play anyway.
God Bless you all!!!!!
LFL is better than the panzies of the kneelFL
Thank you, ladies!
much love you ladies from a man who was never interested in sports to begin with. i hope you become bigger than the NFL. us patriots are behind you
So we've finally gotten to the point where the women of this country are more of a man then the men are. Congratulations you bunch of fucking cry baby snowflakes
Yup fight for your rights when the only way females get noticed playing football is when you're half naked and looked at as sex symbols.
Awesome thank you!
 >when women have bigger balls then men\nwhat a world we live in right now. 
THIS IS FUCKIN AWESOME.\nFuck the NFL, bunch of cry babies who made millions, some of them get 1 mill per game - , mostly blacks who can't stand the fact that Donald Trump is white and he's a Patriotic President. They  are used by Zionists, Liberals and all this is Pushed by mass media owned by Zionist Jews - CNN, ABC, NBC or ESPN.
LFL rocks!!! I'm buying tickets to watch the LFL!
The anthem says One nation under God with liberty and justice for all. Its a good idea that America never applied into unbias action. You stand and place your right hand over your heart quickly for a peice of cloth, on a song about war. When was the last time you stood up and placed your hand there for God? THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN STUDIES HAVE PROVEN THAT ALL DO NOT GET LIBERTY AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT JUSTICE!!!\nIf you love your country, drop to one knee. Tell her I love you baby, but your wrong and work on getting her right. If you love America stop feeling love for a damn peice of cloth and feel the pain of AMERICANS around you!!!! The athletes are doing it for AMERICANS, and GOD! Would you place your hand over your heart for a LIE?
Screw the N F Hell, I respect those who show respect. LFL > NFL
These ladies are true patriots.
Bless you LFL!
DOD has paid all professional sports teams to have players stand for national anthem to get recurits and manipulate the people into supporting it's jesuit Zionist Global war on Terror .  Supposedly Senate did not agree with this spending but happened anyway
What kind of butthurt liberal snowflakes downvote this vidya?
Only asshole democrats think the American flag only represents only white Americans. America is a country where any race can be successful because every race is a American. So many rich black men yet they think they are oppressed. Screw you anti American pro criminals democrats....
Well looks like I found my NFL replacement
Bravo!!!
I cant begin to describe how proud of the LFL for standing up FOR the Flag of this great Nation. Thank you so much!
Good 4 the women's league..a new fan !
I am NOW officially a fan of the LFL!!
Subbed. NO MORE NFL.
We are not protesting the flag you morons. just tell the cops to stop killing inocent black dudes and we'll stop kneeling.
But yet people didnt have a problem with Kid Rock cutting a hole in the american flag and wearing it as a poncho.....even though that is against the Code of the flag.....This is a free country. They have the right to kneel and you have the right to be mad and not watch.  All you people are so against dictators but yet you want to force your ideals on to other people.
Statement of LFL supporting the protesting of the National anthem\nhttps://youtu.be/7AhJsVTgnq0
There's a time and place for protest, your workplace is not a great choice!
Why was i not told this exists !
The only ones that agree with this obvious racist I Stand bullshit are the ones proud of the murdeous heritage. If you took a second to read about the history of how America came to me, you’d understand how the flag doesnt mean the same for everyone. \nI find the flag completely offensive because I had to learn the history that was denied to me. So fuck you Trump, LFL, and any other stupid incompetent dumb piece of shit who refuses to acknowledge that white supremacy is the root of all things evil and why this country has flourished. WE built this country so YOU get the fuck out.
this divide is getting out of hand.once again,people are kneeling not to protest against our troops but protesting b/c we are not upholding WHAT THEY FOUGHT AND DIED FOR!!!!!😧 How can we fight for nations to have democracy when EQUALITY and JUSTICE for all is clearly still a problem in our OWN nation.i will kneel because this is not what they died for when a cop can stop a 10 year old boy and shoot him in cold blood and get away with it.THINK. AMERICA.THINK.
Lol... what a joke.\n\nOf course they're standing... they're 97% White.\n\nDuh.
WOW!!! A league of hot ass bitches more American, more Patriotic, and more Respectful than the pathetic, over-paid, premadona,  useless asshole NFL'rs. AWESOME.
Chance is real 👍
Chance has always been a role model for me and it's crazy to see how far he's come. I'm so proud of him. He inspired me and showed me the way. He was one of the main reasons I started writing music, Thank you Mr. Chano. P.s..If you guys got a minute, check out the music on my channel.I promise you won't be disappointed.
I am Brazilian and I have doubts about why they censure a word Nigga.
how can you not love chance the rapper
This song is like a line of life. Like he is saying I have a God and he is going to take me one day so I'm going to live all my days on earth with a purpose. He is saying that I don't care that we all have problems. We all do. He doesn't care if you're gay or had a baby out of wedlock. He is saying the day is on its way it couldn't wait no more He saying live the life man that God made for you. I was a quarterback in high school and going on to play college football but I came out and they kicked me out of my high school so I lost my football dream but I don't worry about it because God has this plan that I have no clue about.
This is real rap,  Take notes you mumble rapping tizums.
the background transition!!!  genius in its self!! what a message! what a collab! Wordplay,   melody, rhyme and poetry for the sou! Thank God for Channo from 79th
Who disliked this? Like......how? This is magic.
@4:25 My nigga Chance knew they done killed that shit ✊🏽
please please please release a studio version
Ok but chance with the heat on his feet
ugh chance I love u and Daniel ur amazing
Jesus is coming! Keep on telling us we making it up...
So glad to have found this. My girl and I were channel surfing and turned this on right as he started. Phenomenal!
This the first thing u see & hear as u enter the gates of heaven i swear
Am I the only one who noticed Lawrence Fishburne disguised as a keyboard player?
They really just blur his mouth when he said shit HAHAHA
Anybody know any artists that have songs or vibes similar to this?
Chance the rapper and Daniel Caesar, I love them both <3
Bout time for a new song
Half of the views are from me
my daughter barely recognize me when i lose the hat
this is probably the best ive heard from chance
yeah this should be this good ... two fav artists on a song
I become religious every time Chance is on.
Chance is the best, fuck you Joe Budden, your music sucked ass GTFO.
GONNA WATCH HIM IN 2 DAYS AT HOLLYWOOD BOWL AND I'M HYPED
I like this song. It has some Acoustic style.
Okay I kind of get what Budden is saying now. I still enjoy the song but it does seems a bit corny... a bit forced at time. Something Daniel Caesar is not. I also feel Daniel was so underutilized. While he was good. He said about 6 words and just provided local melodies!
Y'all been sleeping on Daniel Caesar. Go check out his debut album Freudian and have your mind blown.
he should call the song ' 1964 '
damn that man with the guitar has a voice
I have to see Chance live at some point in my life
SOOO..AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO FREAKED OUT WHEN THEY SAW Daniel...?
Chance just gets better and better
This really just a freestyle or something he wrote the day he performed it🔥🔥
THIRDSTORY IN THE CHOIR GOT ME SHOT
these 2 are a match made in actual heaven #churchboyz
Joe budden was trippin
B_O_R_I_N_G
Joe Budden SMD !!
OH MY GOD DANIEL :'))))
YAHHHHH

Good old chance
Aintanah
Thats deep asf bro
Wow

tittle should say ft. Daniel Ceasar
This got me emotional lol 😅
Chano for mayor!
Chance ruined this song
Wait is that Moses Sumney
Fuck Joe Budden
joe budden is right this is whack
Beautiful <3
Hes a lame industry plant fuck him
that last verse holy shit
Incredible.
bravo
Yup.
Amazing <3
this song is amazing. i love how raw and real it is
I miss the acid rap chance😔
Good but every chance song sounds the same
Chance really got me on my ass with this one... the American dream, may you never wake up.
You go so far you hit a point where you cant uber back that hit me so close to home man
Like a long poem
Who else thinks chance the rapper is the best
A NEW SONG, OKAY, WHAT'S IT CALLED? NOT EVEN IN THE DESCRIPTION...
Wow... Chance needs to release a record already this is fantastic stuff
Any ft. With danial must be good.
WHY ISNT CAESARS NAME IN THE TITLE, SHIT CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD HNNNGGGG
How is he this damn good! He had to freestyle most if not all of it!! He is incredible!
CHANCE AND DANIEL DREAM COME TRUE
Yahhh!!! Let’s gooo, my two favorite artists right now just collaborated and this is fucken dope!
chance needs his new album to be all like this
this is sick. glad to see my boy daniel caesar getting some love too!!! he's awesome
and to infinity\nsuch songs i treasure\nBeautiful
Im gonna use this as my alarm
When Chance and Daniel have a song together 😩 and it’s so beautiful, I just wanna die tbh I can’t take it 😭
If you like vibey lit music https://soundcloud.com/nitetimex/bipolarprod-daennite
That was beautiful
I’m crying 😭😭
You are appreciated Chance 🙌🏽🙌🏽
I miss acid chance :(
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Daniel Caesar x Chance? Sold.
daniel caesers teath
That was incredible
ok but can we appreciate Daniel Caesar too?
chance is has downs right?
You betta preach....Chance the Minister!!!
I can’t take this song serious after watching joe budden’s take on it.. 😂😂
Freaking legend. xx
Whoever calls chance the rapper an industry plant after this, shouldn't be taken serious.
He don't understand how much I'm in love with the way he is... I just don't understand how someone could be this beautiful and not be my soulmate. #mrschancetherapper ctfu

Speaking of lips (which are gorgeous <3 btw) could you do a lip tutorial on how to correctly apply lipsticks, liner, etc.? I have heard of lip exfoliators and other products to help with this but I am very new to the lip realm and can't find helpful videos on this. Thank you! Love you!

This like it might be my favorite
So gorgeous 😍 I love it!! ⚰️🍷
HI CHRISTEN !!! ♥️ I recently seen your snaps and how your eyes been twitching, also how you said you had Bell’s palsy when you were 16, My mom she’s 31 yrs old and she had gotten Bell’s palsy when she was 10 and In January she came home from work and she felt numbness on the right side of her face and she went to the E.R. And found out she had Bell’s palsy. To treat her Bell’s palsy she went to acupuncture and physical therapy, and did facial exercises. Hopefully you don’t have it because you are the best person on YouTube I’ve seen doing makeup💕♥️ I hope I could help💯💕🤞🏼🙏🏼
Am only 11 and I have watched all of your videos. I love your channel so much

I love you christen i am from lebanon and i liked all your videos befor watching it cz i know you are  perfect 😍😘😘❤
i like how you always cut yourself off in the middle of talking like you wanna tell yourself: shut up, Christen.
Love everything about this look! Fabulous! 😍😍😍
I'm stuck at home watching these vids...
Wow no highlighter? 😱 love you so much Christen!!! ❤️
You are so lucky. Meaning your god-given  features of very big eyes and huge lid space make application of make up ideal.  Also you quite smartly play up their size. It’s a gorgeous look and thank you for sharing it with us.
i love you guys so much, thank you for always being there for me through everything
Daaaamn she talks fast! Loved the look   👌🏻
i would like to see your makeup collection in a video
Love you James Charles 🙌🏽💯
One day I will have makeup... And then I can come back to these chit chat vids and do my makeup with james...untill hen I watch in makeup-less sorrow
clickbait is so annoying and desperate
Fuck the haters sister! you are unique and perfectly yourself! YOU ARE MY BIGGEST INSPIRATION AND ILYSFM❤️❤️
You are so open and you really  get personal with us. That's really hard to find on the internet lately, and it means a lot to find a YouTuber that really shows us his personal side. Also you are an amazing and talented person, so no matter what others say, you are still awesome. Please don't quit YouTube because there's so may people out there that love you so much. You have me and so many other people that love you so much. Thank you for that. I love you so much, and please keep doing what you normally do.
So you aren't really leaving YouTube. You only left for a few days. Click bait. Disappointing
Stay strong ❤️ you’re a huge inspiration to everyone 😽 love you 💯
You should do a mermaid Halloween tutorial! It would look so cute on you!
Just in time for Halloween.
You're a wonderful make up artist so I'll start there. As a woman I really hate when you call everyone sisters. I feel like you refer to yourself that way as well and it irritates me. There are men in the make up world, as you obviously know.
you are so talented, your make-up skills are beyond this world<3
Ok like James you’re actually my favorite. You give the best advice😍😘
James your eyes are so beautiful
I'm just living for your nails!
I wish Charles would accept his beautiful brown eyes more instead of hiding them with his contacts..
He's so amazing ❤
If your relying on clickbait that means your not entertaining 👀
That was absolutely beautiful.
Let your wings cut those bitches up james
THIS LOOK IS SO SO SOOOOO BOMB
When he talks he looks half asleep😂😂 I love how real you are❤️❤️
Damn. Got my hopes up for nothing.
James Charles I thought I ordered some sisters merch, but I haven't received it but when I was ordering it it said it went through and that I would be getting an email, but I haven't received one
being that young and trying to be as respectful and supportive as you do, youre one of the few makeup artists i actually like youre so talented
I have 3 melting pouts and all of them stopped squeezing out easily after like 2 weeks, they're kind of drying, and they come off so easily that I can't wear them through the day. Idk, that was just my experience, I hope any of you that have them are having a better one than me.
So where's the link to see your apparel? \nI like the hoodie, but I need to see everything! 😛
He really does look like dragon from shrek
Bye bih 👋🏼
when he says to get ready with him i really dont cuz i dont have makeup i just eat and wait if my future comes on a bottom of a bowl of cereal
By the title I thought you were leaving forever! Omg if you ever permanently left YouTube I'm gonna be upset but I understand why you needed a break.
the eyes are absolutely beautiful omg
You are such a beautiful human and you honestly my icon and honestly you should never listen to any of those negative people because all of your fans love you so much ❤️❤️❤️
You are so  talented I've learned so much from you and you are amazing don't listen to anyone. Your hands are gold and you deserve everything that you've achieved. Love you❤️❤️
THIS MAKEUP IS EVERYTHING! 😍
You're talking so dang fast in this video woooooh!!  Lol but I agree
Awww James it's all okay . We don't think you're complaining at all . We love you more than anything . Also sisters stay sisters for life . Stick like glue ♥️
Love your makeup but why would you make your title such clickbait.. lol I don't understand why you wouldn't just title it addressing the hate or something like that.
you should be flashback mary for halloween
Why doesn't James ever blend his foundation into his neck properly? You can clearly see how tan his foundation is next to his neck...
Not being horrible but how crusty are his lips , no hate i love him <3
This look was so fucking pretty 😩😍🔥
Can you Do the power of make up video?❤️
Love you James, your amazing and I love you so so much<3 your amazing and deserve so much better <333 I love you 💕 @jamescharles
Why James whhhhyyyyy ????!!!! I thought u were seriously leaving YouTube !!!! 🤦🏻‍♀️😭😭 but in the bright side your not leaving 🙏🏼💕💕💕💕 I love you so fucking much !! Stay strong and keep slaying 💙💙💕
Who else came here when they say Finn dragging James Charles 😂
Cutting straight to the point *14: 41 to find out it was freaking clickbait*
Who else watches James Charles on 0.75 speed since he talks so fast?! 😂
I think you are so chill.you are pretty and handsome at the same time! Can u do more cover girl products?
I was looking for a lip liner that would work with all my different lipsticks. I didn't know covergirl offered a product like that.
I only clicked on this because it said he was leaving YouTube... I'm a victim of clickbait
Okay we get it, you think he speaks fast, Whatever. Jeez! 😂
James I greatly respect you. All you said makes sense , i like how u dont hide it and u just lay it all out there. U arent like most people who just act like none of that gets to them, ur honest with urself and everyone else.
Awe Jamessss! We love you so much!!! There is nothing wrong at all with taking a break, sister!
I love you James I’m the biggest fan and biggest supporter I will never stop watching I have every sister apparel all my makeup looks are inspired by you even though I don’t do makeup that much when I watch you make me forget my worry you are the only one when I’m alone you make me forget thank you so much if you see this James I absolutely love You and that is why
So im going to do a really genuine video and talk with you guys but just to let you know its sponsored so i would have never done it if i wasnt getting paid because im having a dramatic breakdown.
Keep fighting the good fight, baby. Every wonderful thing that happens to you, you deserve. Every hurtful thing that is said to you, you don't deserve. You're beautiful, inside and out. And you are much loved.
Thank you James for posting this and for being so real :)
quick little spritz \n*uses whole bottle of setting spray*
damn, can you do my makeup? lol. this is a beautiful look.
i have so much respect and love for you and you are so important to me. much love <3
i really wish you would use some chapstick cause your lips look so dry >.<
I love this look! I don't have a purple colour but I'm going to do smthing
You're a great freaking person I don't know why people hate on u
if I find a hate comment I want u to run your hands and I will beat your ass and if u don't like the vid or the person then don't watch like tf
Your the best and I'm only 11 year old  and I look up to you and my name is Tyhera 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
that is a bomb ass eye look damn boy
Love this video!! Love you! Hate and negativity is hard to ignore but focus on the fans who truly care and love you!
Was I the only one who was shocked when he didn’t use lilly lashes in Miami’s and had to stop for a minute to collect how much he has changed( jk he hasn’t changed in a bad wat at all)
James u r a amazing person,you deserve the world ❤️
You make me want to puke.
you should do a deep/dark green look! i think it will bring out your eyes
you'd make a great auctioneer damn
I thought it was funny how james would be talking about something serious and then he would stop and be like im gonna take my clean morphe m brush... ps i love you so much
I actually love him, but why does he sound like his nose is always stuffed?
Hey sisters any small youtubers wanna support each other? :)
ILY sister. 😙
Omg He said Oops I Tried 🤣❤
we love u
he talks sooo fast
That eye look 😍😍

You are sooo talented James!
He looks like donkey's dragon girlfriend
Hi James ❤️ I hope you see this....\nYou are so inspiring to so many people (including me). You are amazing and you inspired me to love makeup.💄literally every time I watch your videos I want to follow along and do makeup with you 😂  your fricken flawless! I love you and your videos and can I just say SLAY ALL DAY SISTAA!!!!!! 😘❤️😉😂
I Shore hope I get a chance to play this game.Game is Shorely stunning from what I can tell after watching this.
Would i be able to pick which era i play in multiplayer
I want people to stop all the shit talk. This game looks amazing. We have a single player career mode, more locations, a range of Era's, more playable options and the Dog Fights look so impressive. 100% buying :)
Five different game modes. Not really sure if that is a pro or a con.
Still waiting on a Battlefront more impressive than the ORIGINAL Battlefront II. Until you can do better than 260 people in an epic battle royal on XL mode, i am calling this new Battlefront unimpressive.
Idk guys. Whenever something is so hyped up like this I usually get so disappointed. For me the only game that really lived up to the hype was Skyrim. Although if this is what its really hyped up to be it's gonna be amazing
I'm only here because of the Clone Wars
Now can we have another KOTOR, please?
How many locations in single player????
It's a trap!
Am so damn excited and is a badass game
Plz put anikan in the game
I wish it was at least 32 vs 32 in galactic assault
Which holiday is he referring to?
Member star fighter's
Funny game Love it
And a pay to win game great
Why cant it be 2004 again
I just hope Anakin is in it
They're selling the hell out of this game! This trailer makes me want to buy multiple copies of the same game!
I dont know why but i am way too excited about playing as yoda
We already have ptsd from the 1st one
Just because you CAN pay to win, does NOT mean it's not pay to win. That's what I'm hearing. Stop defending EA and other greedy game companies that use microtransactions.
I love the fact that the campaign is about a villain's rise to power. Sexy-ass stormtrooper, Janina.
EA/DICE you should make jango fett a playable character because you already have the design and voice from boba fett. please EA/DICE I'm begging you!
Get Auto Friend Request and Increase Follower\nhttps://youtu.be/f3MNSlUjnBo
I dont want to preorder but this video slaps me in the face with hype.
Idk if i get an answer but are those crates only able to obtain through payment or playing aswell?
So I’m probably only going to be playing heroes ca villains.. IM SO READY IM TRUSTING EA WITH THIS ONE!!🔥🔥
No matter what, for however long I might own this game, I WILL NEVER, EVER PLAY with Ma-Rey Sue.
So they heard everything everyone was complaining about, and fixed it.  Outstanding!
Lot of people are quite hateful and distrusting of EA lately which i don't blame them for the past with certain things but honestly they haven't been that bad lately, look how great titan fall 2 was  that they published. Respawn made a great sequel with a full campaign and one of my fav campaigns now. I feel like i can trust EA with publishing this sequel as well for being a even better upgrade on the first new battlefront.
I feel like a kid again I can't wait joyyyyyy😁
Anyone here wanna buy some death sticks?
Plus free DLC as what I've heard for this game, thats a miracle! In games now a days😂👏
Original maps from fist bf! Droids! Wookies! More rides! More hero's! Maps! Ahh its like original ooh a campaign! EA you have my money!!😃😀💵💵💵💵💲💲💲💰💰💰💳💳💳 take NY money away!
More fanboys than 2011 COD in this chat.
Star wars has become liberal central
Bought battlefront 1... Never again will I buy into the hype
Did Luke just force push Vader to death at 2:59???
Looks like a movie
Who thought Star Wars force awakens was a shit movie because seriously fuck Rey/Mary sue the person that can do anything. I hope they make the force awakens part fun
at 1:20 it says Tl-50 has secondary fire, sector is not clear
Ok, EA, please DO NOT rush this out, do NOT rush this out, do NOT rush this out!!!\n\nYou are taking steps in the right direction this time, DO NOT mess this up! \n\nDon't let the blood get to your head just yet! \nThis is GOOD. Ya hear me?\n\nDO NOT MESS THIS UP\n\nNOT an unfinished bullsh*t product like last time, please. Last time was a fking sh*t show. No man's sky BS + 1-million-dollar DLC or whatever the fk that was.\n\nEA. PLEASE. JUST THIS ONCE.
I really hope they add jango fett, I'm not saying jangos better than boba, bc boba is obviously better, I'm just saying that I got really triggered when I saw boba on kamino and not jango😂
when is this game coming out
The only bad thing about this game is nerf the DC-15’s fire rate do it feels more like the blaster in the movies and tv show
Soooo.... do we get this for free if we bought the first crap game?
i’m gonna love it regardless just because it’s star wars
Why can't we preorder the disc version for consoles on Amazon? Come on guys.
Should of never make the first game sug a half ass game for making money with shitty half as content compare to the original
Trurly beautiful. And thank you for making suck a beautiful game. We could never ask for more because you gave us all we wanted. We just hope more ideas will come along as days past buy.
Great trailer! informative, well narrated, and exciting. Can't wait for this on XONEX
WE FIGHT LIKE BARBARIC ANINALS TILL WE DEATH TAKE US
I'm glad that EA is trying to get Star Wars battlefront 2 to kind of be like it's other counterpart. Star Wars battlefront  2( the classic )
If this game turns out to be as good as it looks, I might have to buy a dedicated gaming PC.
This is what the EA's Battlefront should be in the first place. Looks really nice, actually.
Mind trick only works on the weak minded... guess Darth Maul is a dummy.
This game is coming out on my birthday
don't fuck it up, don't fuck it up, don't fuck it up, don't fuck it up,
Hey EA, will the new game have an app companion like the first one or will it use the first one?
no, this is Patrick.
You know EA, you still have a chance to make Skate4. #MakeEaSkateAgain
No this is patrick
I would so get this game but I'm using all my money for cod ww2
I started crying
No Galactic Conquest!? :(
That intro..
Yay microtransactions
the graphics are sorta bananas
where is Donnie yen?????
DLC wish list:\n\nHeroes/Villains:\n 1.) Obiwan and Gen Grevious\n 2.) Mace and Jango\n 3.) Qui Gon and Anakin\n\nTroopers:\n 1.) Gen Grevious body guards (with staff not guns)\n 2.) Droidekas \n 3.) that CQB trooper from Force awakens
HYPE!!
I NEED IT \n\n\n\n\nI NEEED IT\n\n\n\n\n\nI NEEEEEEEEEEEEEED IIIIIIIIT
Luke Skywalker boss fight confirmed
awesome
Ben kenobi!!!
Clear... NOT CLEAR *NOT CLEAR* !
1:37 Is that Padme or Leia?
BETA!!!!! THIS WEEKKK!!!!!!
Where's Jango Fett??
WHERES MY OBI WAN

Battlefront 2 2017  in Battlefront 2 2005 mod !!  http://gametoast.com/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=33245
Looking at EA like 😕😕🤔🤔
This feels like an older game somehow...
can this fucking game just HURRY UP AND COME OUT....??? lol\n\nHere waiting for AC origins and this shit to release...still gonna be a couple months before this shit gets released....god hopeful they totally don't push the shit back to mid december or some weird shit.\n\nEhh i'll be working by the time this game releases so i highly doubt i'll have all the time to play it anyway tbh.
Hey EA, how about giving us Switch gamers an online mode in FIFA 18. Oh you forgot? Cool. Ill forget to buy Battlefront 2 when it comes out and instead get Super Mario Odyssey..
Cool man cant wait for it to drop!
This new battlefield looks great!
Why make another? Come up with something new and original instead of staying in your comfort zone and milking a series dry. Boring.
It’s literally a battlefront 2 remake with battlefront original
You can find them in crates..... HMMMMM SUPPY DROP?
2:58 do you have 3 arms?
Awesome video man - it was fun to watch. Thank you for sharing.
And here i am , staring at my empty fridge
Just added this restaurant to my must visit places in Singapore. That tripe looked divine!
When were you in Poland? Are there any vids from that trip?
the chef was wondering how could this dude eat so much
Nice timing 11:11 when you ended the video
Great way to eat animals.. nothing wasted!!
I'm going to have to place a try when I go next year.
My favorite video by far!!!
DOES NO ONE NOTICE THAT THING BEHIND MIKE THIS SHOULD BE DEMONITISED
And then I realised I had some pizza left in my fridge. I feel so cheap xD
I can't eat thin stuff with a fork. I can only do it with chopsticks
Spanish restaurant, really ? Ok but with a lot of french cuisine influence.
I will commit suicide today please pray god for me.
Your video's are always the best mike❤❤
I think you should collab with First We Feast. Eat spicy chicken wings.
Mike, try South African cuisine!!
Love beets ever since does mike know that the Beet is a vegetable?
Is the pig skin pasta not on the menu?
Damn it Mike. Lol, you expression just says it all.
Man that chick in the painting is kicking em out wide
Wow. Quality and Presentation written all over this restaurant.
I would have been the on customer to lick the plates
I think I lost weight from my mouth watering for 11 minutes... Hmmm
do you have to pay these restaurants any money to film inside?
This was really difficult to watch because of the painting behind you, the chef's accent,  and the house music that was playing in the background.  And for me, personally, the combinations of flavors and ingredients did not really look that appetizing.
A little too primal for me... but I would be lying if I said my mouth wasn't watering the entire time.
so who was holding the second fork ???
How can he eat so much without getting full!
I have been to Dehesa. It is one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. Every dish the chef serves is a flavour bomb.
I'm just gona come right out and say it, Mr. Chen, you are really a great critic, in the sence that you cut the hypocritical BS upper class swines love to impregnate humble and high end kitchens alike. \n\nWe commend you, aqui do Brasil.
Good marketing when a restaurant reached out to a food channel.  Costs a miniscule amount in product to reach out to over 100k-400k people.
I live in Singapore
Glad you liked Singapore I am from Singapore BTW
Sad to say this looks terribly pretentious and is presented with alot of intentional smokescreens. When he brought the ice-cream with no sugar then proceed to stab it with caramel..and kept saying, no sugar, that really took the cake with that kind of comment.
Oh, using all the cuts of pork. I thought it's about actually eating the whole pig.
Look out, you are getting fat
Loved how the chef explained each and every dish in detail. Thanks for uploading. 😊
i love your background music choices haha.
Wow. I love that food 😍
2:57 He has three arms?
I enjoy your videos as they are interesting, informative, and I get to travel with you to so many places.  All I can say about this meal is Better You Than Me, LOL, because I wouldn't have been willing to try any of it, except for maybe the dessert.

I love this so much!!!
MADI ALL THE WAY
ALL OF MY FAVE SONGS ARE IN THIS COVER **dead**
Equally talented.. can’t decide on a winner
who noticed when she messed up the timing lol
nice song i love it ^_^
someone should make a playlist of all the songs separately <3
Am i the only one who think madison and conor look cute together..? I mean they look at each other as if they are in love.. i ship it.
This is  the 30th time  I'm watching this💫❤😍
oh my goodness i got chills i love this i love this so much

Oml! This is the best thing!
Omg this one is my absolute favorite out of all of then

There's no question about it, consciousness comes from the brain. Don't insert pseudoscience into this.
It’s alive! ALIVE!!!!!!!!!
A very informative video about a very bad idea.
This is just in time for Halloween season.
I feel empathetic for the person that is so desperate to be the head to be transplanted. At least you get to fade out in a medically induced sleep knowing you will probably never wake up. The person that is willing to do this is obviously doomed to an inevitable end and the person that is brain dead is in much the same situation. Neither person has much to lose here. Also this is probably going to be someone younger and capable of handling the stress and potential recovery. There's really no reason to make this political. If the doctors are willing to try it, more power to them. Think about this as if it is you facing eminent death, early in life, and you might have a chance to live longer.
I had a brain surgery and I  would  not recommend  the precedure. i was traumatized, imagine  the  guy when he wakes up, hell no! really  scary stuff.
thats absurd! why doesnt this quack start curing people with severed spinal cords then? if he thinks he can cut off a head and reconnect it, he should start with his own!
You cannot transplant a human head it is not possible you cannot get the nerves to grow back together otherwise we would have a cure for all paralyzed people.This must be some kind of publicity stunt. This is absolutely morally wrong this is ridiculous something should be done about this YouTube should stop this this is absolutely ridiculous this is absolutely a very bad joke they're paralyzed people all over the world and they should not be given a false hope something so ridiculous
Trillions of nerves and blood vessels to be connected....
I have never been so disturbed. Imagine going to sleep and waking up with someone elses body. How can this even work? The body reject new head?
Why... why why why why whyyyyyy wouldn’t they practice by putting accidentally severed heads back on their own bodies before doing this?
I have a prediction,  by the end of this operation there will be two dead people.
...ehh, it's more like transplanting a body
When exactly is the operation scheduled?
Theoretically you could live forever wirh he this
bbc earth labs i would love to know how you get your info
Which is the body where it will be transplanted his name???
This type of stuff sounds like what my biology teacher would do.
Soap opras  have been doing it for years hahaha
This is going to go horribly wrong...
The healthy brain, if the surgery is successful, will still need to relearn how to control a body, given the fact that the person has been paralyzed all his life. So, even if everything goes fine, he will need tons of physical and neurological rehabilitation.
X Files did it first.
wouldn't it be quite a surprise if the transplant was successful but the guy claims to be and acts like the guy who went brain dead.
The fact this sotry actually turned out to be true and not some elaborate marketing for Metal Gear Solid V blows my mind honestly...
During kidney transplant the faulty kidney is not removed thus thw patient has 3 kidneys...
Is this a Jojo reference?
How are we meant to know if it works without trying?
I'm just gonna wait until they create prostethic bodies Ghost in the Shell style, thanks.
I believe there will be one big fail :/
Lucky for me I don't need transplants. But I hope to have robot body when I'm very old and live forever YEAH!
Is it possible to transplant a head of a girl to a head of a man or vice versa?
I have a feeling that some people with high power within the medical industry would undermine this.
I really hope the surgeons play Eminems 'Lose Yourself' during the operation.\n😆
its technically.. a body transplant
just thinking about it makes me cringe
Guys, don't get ahead of our selves. ;)
What if its the head's last hope of surviving and the body donor is already clinically dead?  why does the video only explores the controversial side but at least no a single different approach
This will be an amazing experiment - even if it fails. If it works - we gain a major insight into the connection between the body and the brain in addition to getting a step closer to having a synthetically grown body replacement for spinal cord injuries, lost limbs and various other conditions potentially including death! Or, if it turns out growing a body is too hard or expensive, we can just wire the head into a robotic body able to keep the head alive until a replacement body can be safely grown.\n\nThere is a first time for everything. This body transplant was bound to happen sooner or later. Even a failure here will push us towards the first success. This will be a great leap in medical science one way or the other.
Is this some sort of European April Fool's day that I'm not aware of?
Lots of your facts are incorrect. Do you fact check at all?
Not for me thanks, but I am a registered diner.
In the name of SCIENCE!!
I imagine we'll have better luck in the future if we manage to make trainable wetware interfaces - you'd grow a network of connections into the base of the patient's brain, then attach a signal processor. Do the same to the top of the spine of the donor body. Train computers to interpret each body's signalling, then connect the computers. This way, you could correct for differences between the two nervous systems with software. Much more precise than just hoping for the best in case nerve behavior doesn't match up between bodies.\n\nOf course, we'd need to figure out how to grow those artificial nerve taps first, and then how to probe the connections without causing brain damage
The dog head being kept alive is probably the most disturbing thing I have ever seen.
It would help if ur a dullahan
Oh, idk maybe you should do this successfully on an animal first.... All those dogs and monkeys died minutes later.
sounds weird but I would choose to change my body with one from the other gender. I don't think this will make it harder? Or take the body of a chimpanzee!
I understand how exciting it is from a scientific technical viewpoint.... and do we really need that? Who is important enough  to revive this $$$ endeavour. It would be interesting to see what this would be fotr the new combined human.. there are memories by the body beside the brain... and for example the gut brain connection... i would rather have us figure out how we can make life  good for us and all living beings on this planet first... solving urging now problems... but humans curiosity of its ability to figure out nature seems non unstoppable
Do NOT search the video of the bodyless dog. Don't do it. Just Don't.
There are thousands of nerves in the spinal chord, are they going to just glue them all together as a clump or are they going to try and connect each nerve individually and how would they know which individual nerve is which? If they glue it as a single clump, how will the nerves know what to do? it's not like the nerves themselves can seek out and find the correct corresponding nerve to connect to. If they try to do it individually, the time it would take would probably leave the brain with irreparable damage. Morality aside, this is a fascinating and exciting prospect for medical science, although I doubt very much that there is any chance of success. Respect to the person volunteering to have their head transplanted though, even if I was a quadriplegic and dying, I wouldn't be brave enough to volunteer for this operation.
there's no way it's going to be successful
What's the moral questions about, if the donor wants to donate his life to science?
I've been reading about this for a while. I'm soo curious of the outcome.
Will the person have 2 different dna s. Or will the head adapt to the body or is it the other way around?
I'm hoping such a procedure does occur, and even more so for it to be successful.
If I was terminally ill I would definitely take the procedure, even on the experimental stage. I would also consider it if I was immobilized by an accident or a disease (if it was already perfected).\n\nIf they manage to do the thing safely, I suppose this will be a gateway for ~rich~ people who would like to gender swap with fully functioning organs
sound just like instructions on how to put a phone back together
How many spinal nerve 'glue joints' will there be?
i have heard of the news where sergio gonna do it and i cant believe that a month later i think, we are gonna see the first head/body transplant
Just transplant the guys balls there problem solved (if we can do that)
You are transplanting a body, not the head!
PEG was used as a carrier fluid for electronic cigarette fluid early on, it wasn’t very popular due to its taste.
if i was disabled or some other life threatening issue. then yes i would have it done.
Drain the head of blood, seems like a problem recovering from that alone.
skip tp 3:00 if you are not a moron.
Wonder how messed up the persons life/body currently is, who is getting the new body transplant, with quite a big of a risk that it might fail.
Wasn’t this just a publicity stunt for metal gear solid 5?????
Maybe this is body transplant
Just thinking about this is giving me the shakes, I do not like this at all 😵😳🤦
Does he get to keep both passports? Portrait from one and fingerprints from the other.
I cut the nerve bundle in my index finger. The surgeon stitched it back together, but after 20 years I still have poorly localized feeling in that finger because the nerves are all cross wired and shorted together. Imagine a whole spine...
imagine the possibilities if this works
IMMORTALITY HERE I COME
Fish head curry anyone?
Mengele would be proud!
DOUBT
Dope.
Erw
MGS STUN
The real question is. when the patient survives. will his offspring be his body's or his owns? :O
I dont know if this aught to be done
You get a like for the holding back of the pun.\n\nBut it was a good one! \n\nHave a nice weekend, Greg. Don't get ahead of yourself. :D
Is this video directed at children? because wow this is said so childlike
Wait so whats stopping thr donor body from being drained of its blood when the original head is decapitated from it? \nSurely the exposed boood vessels will result in the heart pumping the blood out of the neck.... Its not like they can cauterise the wounds since they need the blood vessels to be intact
if the body  gets injured, lets say a cut, would his brain be able to communicate with his body to heal the wound if the dna wouldn't be the same?
Just to clarify, doctors do not remove the failed kidneys of the transplant recipient unless the patient is too small to carry 3 kidneys (like children) or they have a disease called Polycystic Kidney disease or PKD, which covers your kidneys with cysts and enlarges them to the size of a football. I had a kidney transplant a year and a half ago and I have 3 kidneys, my two diseased kidneys still sit in their natural position and the transplanted kidney in the front, right above the bladder.
polyethylene glycol is a laxative...
What if is successful, then i can transplant my head to a young teenager body to live longer.
how can the donor body be revived if it's dead?
I just want a cybernetic body...
when we shake a pen or pencil it seems like a wave.why?
Poor donor. Gotta live the rest of his days without a body.
i think you missed probably one of the biggest questions: where is the donor body coming from?!
Can we stop calling it head transplant and inventing silly excuses for why we do so, and instead be adults and call it body transplant?
Wait..whose _body_ are they taking it from? That guy consented?!
I have a feeling before attempting a real paying person for the procedure. They are gonna practice with deathrow inmates or secret prisoners, human trafficking victims. And perfect it just like other past experiments to learn. Humans species are crazy gotta sacrifice many to advance in the world
I am not a doctor but, how are they planing that the brain will survive minutes without blood? I thought that is pretty much the definition of being dead.
A question that’s prob been asked a hundred times but what are the little numbers that pop up throughout the video? What do they mean? \n\nThanks
I will pray to my God to make this procedure fail and for the doctors involved to burn forever in their own personal Hell.
#9 on trending😱😱😱
#9 on trending? Hey I don’t mind if people want to see us playing decent football for once
What a performace.
Sir Bobby would be proud.

Thank you Ipswich! Brightened up my day!
Played great last night, only shame was the corner they scored. Mcgoldrick was class as always.

We had enough highlights last night to fill a 90 minute video. Only 2 minutes? We were on fire last night. COYB! 🚜🚜🚜🚜
Let's all take a second to laugh at Sunderland
This is 15th on trending
Goals are like potato chips. One is never enough.
What was Steele doing for that 5th goal 😂😂😂 can't believe I got 66/1 on this pile of crap being relegated & 12/1 bottom half finish
Shouldn't have left blackburn🤣
Waghorn doing it again against his team
Its trending cuz Sunderland were at the top and now lost 5-2 wow
Sunderland is a joke of a club. Goodbye Sunderland , being in the premiere league is history for you guys. You guys will never make it back. Oh and BTW, I'm a man u fan and I miss the guaranteed 6points every season. Anyway seems like crystal palace will be more than happy to hand out this service.

How on earth to Millwall have higher odds on promotion than Ipswich
Sunderland fans 10, Ipswich fans 1. SAFC were thrashed 5-2 but the away end sang for 90 minutes. Never experienced such a lame home crowd. It's like they're in the waiting room at the doctors – until they score the fifth! Aldershot would make more noise away at Carlisle.

Voting is almost over ya Beautiful Bastards! Then we can all go back to doing... whatever it is we all do. lolololol. AGH. I'm gonna regret this Hooking Up thing, huh?
I actually agree with most of Trump's 3.0 ban. I don't think it's honestly a Muslim ban and I don't think it ever has been. We have a dumb president who doesn't want terrorists and can't do anything about it without heavily criticism
AMERICA 21st in FREEDOM!!, only 20 other countries are more free!
I find this whole boycott the NFL thing ridiculous. So what if someone kneels for the flag, or doesn't stand for the national anthem. THAT is what our soldiers are fighting for. They're fighting for our right to pick which one we want to do, sit or stand for the national anthem. That is one of our amendment's, freedom of speech and expression. It's more un-american to tell someone you have to do something if they don't want to do or are trying to make a statement peacefully.
Forcing people to stand for the flag is to force nationalism on people. We're supposed to protect the right to protest peacefully, we take the moral highground against those that disrespect us. Trump sounds kinda dictator-ish. No I dont think hes trying to be the next Kim family, I just think he lacks any ability to critically think.
Direct TV NFL package cancelled!!! These  millionaires in NFL do not deserve my hard earned money.  I will stick to the non BS UEFA European Championship.
Unpopular opinion: We don't need the anthem before every sporting event, unless we are facing a foreign team, then they also get their anthem. Which that doesn't happen very often. so there that solves that.
NFL players kneeling during anthem = Lazy rich NFL players pretending to care about BLM when they never take personal time to go on talk shows or rally.
I blame Kap for this mess!!!
why is sports becoming political ? why is everything becoming political ?
Some people are just a little country, and some are just a little bit rock n roll...
You forgot to mention how kapernick wore socks stating all cops are pigs.
Team Protest :)
Boycott NFL
Who gives a shit it's just a flag.
*BOYCOTT THE NFL*
The Young Turks is not news
Multiple veterans and active duty members of our military have spoken out in defense of kneeling during the anthem, so now we see a political organization whom is ignoring the people it's claiming to defend in order to stir up it's base.
Bullsh!t, Phil. Thats a crappy right in the middle of the road opinion you got, trying not to offend anybody and be 50/50 its everybody's fault BS. \nDid anybody (anybody) asked Kaepernick when he planned to stop protesting? What was his criterias? When zero minority is oppressed in this country? Was he planning to protest the National Anthem until the end of his f*cking career? \nPhil, enough. \nA f*cking football game isnt the place to protest the flag and the National Anthem because you're not happy about something. \nYou can protest before the game, after the game, publicly, privately, online, whatever. \nBut the football fans, who are held hostages and are forced to watch you also have the right to walk away. \nAnd thats what they're doing. \nThe players didn't understand that its not the NFL that pays their huge salaries. \nIts the fans. \nIts the eyeballs in front of the screens. \nThese players didn't think this thing through.
This comment might be long and probably won't be featured on the Friday show, but this has been dawning on my mind and needed to get it out. Hopefully y'all who do read it keep it civil and give your input.\n\nThis is my opinion when it comes to the whole flag debate. Personally I will stand for the anthem because it shows some kind of respect for the country, even though I'm not that patriotic, but I won't condemn people who kneel during the anthem because one it's their right to just like it's mine to stand. Also because from what I heard and seen it doesn't look like they're doing this to disrespect the flag, anthem or vets but more for social injustice. Do I think it got the message out? Most likely not because everyone is shouting at everyone about what's right and what's wrong and not having a civil conversation. It's just I'm right and you're wrong mentality with most of the people debating this. Could it have been done at a better time instead of during the national anthem? Probably. Because the players and the NFL are getting really bad publicity for it, but like they bad publicity is good publicity because it shined light on them, just probably not the way they wanted. But on the flip side it seems like people of color whenever they do protest peacefully it doesn't get attention or there are more complaints about why are they protesting? There's nothing to protest about so I can see why the NFL players may have protested like this. Also to add another opinion here, I don't think the national anthem should be played at sporting events. It kinda feels like forced patriotism. There are plenty of other days in the year where I can be patriotic if I feel like it. When I go to a game I'm not there to be patriotic. I'm there to watch players play the game and have fun. Though the exception to that is if the game calls on one of those patriotic day then that's fine to be patriotic. But that's my two cents.
Nothing says freedom like mandatory patriotism. It's like we're trying to be more North Korean than North Korea.
People might be more inclined to support the players if they werent such HUGE hypocrits! For decades police turned a blind eye to crimes committed by NFL players. Crimes like sexual abuse, rape, DWI, beating their wives (OJ is a good example here) and they, the players, didnt seem to have a problem with the police then! NFL players are dispropotionately arrested on domestic abuse, rape, sexual abuse, and a plethora of other charges, than the rest of the population. Shouldnt they clean their own house before critisizing others dirty houses?They are protesting what is also a false narrative as the stats just dont support what they claim to be protesting. Instead of protesting the problem 672 steps down the line how about protesting the fact that 6% of the population commits over 50% of violent crimes? How about prostesting the black on black violence and murder rate? How about the black abortion rate? Where are all the youth centers and mentor programs their millions of dollars could build and fund? How many black youths do they work with, and i dont just mean throwing money at the problem.Sure, they have a right to protest but protesting the National Anthem/Flag because of police brutality is like protesting God and the faithful because a bunch of priests are pedophiles.Also, I have the right to protest too but if I did it at my job I would be FIRED! There is a time and a place and while you are being paid millions to play a game is not the time or place to stick your middle finger up to people paying you to PLAY! If this really means that much to them they should address the problems directly, to the people being affected, not just tar every single police officer in the country.I get why they dont do that....because only having a few cases here or there doesnt get them near the attention that doing it during a nationally televised game does.They are presenting it like every police force has every other officer only targeting black people and that is as far from the truth and as false/misleading as the Hands up, dont shoot false, made up narrative that was spun by MSM.
SPORTS! Personally, I love them!
If you’re a PROfessional, you should act like one. Everyone is entitled to freedom of speech outside of their line of work. IF you’re getting paid millions to play a sport that’s not so difficult, you should be thankful for that opportunity the your flag is giving you. It’s funny because most people taking a knee were poor no bodies in life and now that they make millions they think they still matter.
When a citizen while occupying the highest office of the land calls other citizens Son of Bitches he is not only being disgraceful to the Presidency but to the Constitution and not worthy of a salute!
My brother is Army. Brother in law, Airforce. Husband... my entire world... Navy...\nStanding for the anthem, respecting the flag, is for those lost in the fight for freedom. Just because you CAN do something, doesnt mean you SHOULD. My husband hates what is happening. He thinks it is absolutely disgusting. He said he doesnt want your respect, but the fallen MORE than deserve it. \nKneeling is a slap in the face to those lost. And a slap in the face to the families of those lost.\nThey are multi millionaires. Their fanbases are enormous. There are soooo many different ways they could make their point known, without disrespecting the fallen.\nMy husband isnt an NFL fan, but i WAS. i refuse to give them anymore of my time or money, because they arent deserving of it.\nThese celebrities forget that the only value they hold to the vast majority of people ends the second they no longer entertain us. Or rather, the second them entertaining us comes at too great of a cost, or too big of an inconvenience.\nTrump likes to take things way too far, every chance he gets. This situation is no exception. I can say though that i agree with the call for a boycott.\nJust as they have the right to be disrespectful little shits to the men and woman who died for that right... we have the right to stand against their disgusting disrespect, and take away the one thing that matters most to them, their money.\nIf you continue to watch nfl, that is your decision and your right. But i certainly wont be. And neither will MANY of my friends.
Real men stand up for what they believe in; they don't kneel 🇺🇸
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
There's a time and place for everything. When you're at work that's not the time...
North Korea was definitely added so they could say it's not a Muslim ban. North Korean citizens can't normally travel abroad anyways. If trump knew that, I wouldn't hate him so much.
I know this is going to sound very sour but Trump defiantly has his freedom of speech as well. I think its good that people aren't just in the background of these situations. Its good to flex the responses of people when freedom of speech gets put on the line. Its kind of wiping away the dust on our reasons to support our country in any sort of way. The challenge is good, annoying, but good.
I'm fine with the protesting, i know there's a lot of crap in this country, where i live i don't see it though, but i don't support it during the national anthem. It symbolizes a lot for any American who's lost a loved one or a friend in the military. So i say yes, do your protest, but leave it to a time not on a huge part of our countries culture, it's like throwing away maple syrup in canada. it's just not right.
the young turks won? ughh they have no class, no brains and no integrity. thats the only award they should win...that of sleeze bags
I believe people should have choice. But it really upsets me and I'm not even American. All those who died before us to allow us our luxuries now it's shameful to me. I don't think people should be fired outright but I think more people should be supporting their country and those fighting or who died for it instead of disripcting it from their comfy chairs heir expensive shoes stood on the football field. Shameful
Part of what has made the United States great is the fact that people are allowed to floss their ass with the flag in protest: They're allowed to demean our symbols. I thought it a tacit statement that the principles of our nation, the culture of our nation, and the people of our nation are so strong and resolute that we cannot be offended by such actions: We'll let you have your say. And we'll judge you, not for the act of protesting, but for your reason for protesting. If you're protestations are deemed legitimate you'll be praised, if not you'll be condemned. But evidently I was wrong. No one even seems to care about what's being protested, but rather how they're protesting. If you disagree with what they're protesting -- I know I do: Police malfeasance is a national issue, not a racial one -- then criticize their reason for protesting. The anthem is just a song and the flag is just a piece of fabric; no matter how they're robbed of their beauty it can't (or at least shouldn't) affect who we are as a country.
Kneeling for the flag=ok.Staying in locker room=not ok.imo
I don't know about y'all, but sports is supposed to be something we can watch to get away from politics. I think that the players should either stand or stay in the locker room but at the same time, Trump is ORDERING people to fire players! Sounds like dictatorship to me!
Being critical of your country isn't disrespectful, seems like a lot of the south has forgotten that.
They have a right to be free of arrest for grossly disrespecting the ideals of the country.  Everyone has a right to deny their hard earned money to them and to their employers.  Boycott until fired!
If you’re upset about people protesting during the national anthem of the football, you’re unpatriotic and you don’t believe in the principles and values of America. Yes that means you too Trump.
The American flag is often portrayed as a symbol of freedom, equality, and other goals that people fight and have fought to make a reality. In that sense the flag represent the country we want to become. I don't believe the people refuse to stand because they want to disrespect those goals and hopes for the US. They are trying to make a point that who we are and what most of us will say that flag represents are two very different things, that the flag as a symbol does not yet represent this country as a whole and we have to keep fighting to work toward that ideal.
As someone who has marched with the fucking flag across Safeco Field in Seattle, as a soldier in the US Army who has served in some form since I was in fucking high school, and as as a fucking Eagle Scout  - I need to say that Kaepernick not only has the right to kneel, but he was spot-on.\nDonald Trump is using this excuse of the knee to further divide the fabric of American society. If he is successful at dividing Americans in the arena of what is probably America's greatest religion - sports - than we are one step closer to loosing this nation.\nI don't know who Trump is doing this for - whether he is trying to bring back the glory of the Confederacy and have it finally secede from the Union, or if he is a secret Nazi, or if he is a Russian puppet - but every single thing he does is one step closer to the end of this fucking country.
You say you accept the players right to kneel but you don't like it. What don't you like? Do you not like peaceful protest? Do you not believe there is in justice? I don't understand.
The Flag means so much more than what you agree or disagree with. Men and women have sacrificed their LIVES so you can have the freedom to be a football player and make millions. No matter what you're political beliefs are, or if you like or dislike the current president, the flag needs to be respected. Regardless of our right of freedom of speech, I think it is and should be one of those  unwritten rules that the flag is not disrespected. What it stands for is far greater than what people are trying to protest by disrespecting it.
Man Anthony Weiner showing he didn't have a grip on his D-Brand.
NFL is a workplace.  Legally you can say whatever or protest, but you can get fired too.  Seems to me owners are being weak on this issue because of the nature of the business.  Stategically may not be able to fire players because another team could pick them up.  These pro athletes live in a bubble.  What a surprise it started in California.  Should give them same status as Puerto Rico.
Only 3 days old and boy o boy didn't the NFL do the opposite of your comments. Lol
Who would have thought I would ever defend a sport team even crazier a whole association for lack of better words, here's the annoying orange trying to separate the country once again. I thought we had freedoms in this country but I see their slowly fading away and being replaced with one sided patriotism and none sense SAD. I will never deny that people died defending this country it would be stupid to do so, but last time I checked they died defending our freedom to choose because that's what the United States is about. I was thought as an outsider to have respect the flag which I agree, but most of the time some of those people showed little to no respect towards who I am. Yes I am an immigrant but I have nothing but love and respect towards my country of origin and the United states and I side with Kaepernick this time. Until we fix all the inequality in this country I wouldn't stand for the anthem either because I don't feel free and sometimes even represented well with current government.
L on both sides its very clear nfl shot at its target audience and trump shot at nfl its stupid on both sides
NFL = No Fans Left   Fans could protest at nfl parking lot choke points, perhaps  w/ rental cars or LARGE trucks that run out of fuel. What if people did this and lock the doors and walk away ! Imagine DOZENS of cars blocking the parking lot PRE GAME w/ HUNDREDS of cars behind them. It will take HOURS to clear up the mess and the nfl AND THE CRY BABY DISRESPECTFUL TEAMS would loose MILLION$ of dollars. Anti-PROTEST = ON!
Personally, it's all bs.this ain't news worthy when it comes to the NFL. You know, the NFL, that huge Cash cow that pays no taxes and has grossly overpaid players. It's going to bring the NFL views up and make more distractions for us to worry about.
I’ve given this a decent amount of thought. My social media feeds have been a slew of varying opinions on this topic. To denounce kneeling during the National Anthem is disrespectful to Veterans I think is an over generalization of what a Veteran is. We come from different backgrounds, socially, economically, and racially. “Veterans” isn’t a blanket statement that covers some autonomous thinking entity. Some Vets support the kneeling, some don’t. Please stop using all Veterans to bolster your argument, no matter the side.\n\nAs for my opinion on the matter. A protest needs to be uncomfortable and inconvenient. If it’s not one of these two things it can be ignored and a protest that can be ignored isn’t effective. \n\nFor decades Pro Athletes have been role models for kids. It’s not the same as another job. Someone working as a Pipe Fitter doesn’t have the same social impact on youth as someone who is on TV every week. That’s just the way it is. The NFL has awards for outreach into communities, this is something they want. To say that Athlete’s shouldn’t be political is to complete ignore their social importance to society.\n\nThe flag means more than just a representation of the military. The flag represents everything about this country, it’s history, the wars it’s fought, the economic depressions we’ve overcome, the scientific advancements we’ve achieved, and the social and economic adversities we still face today. To sum the flag up into just one of these causes is to ignore everything else about the country. I feel that goes for both sides of this argument.
The original player that refused to stand said why. But when i read it. All i heard was him sayin fuck this country in a nice way. He was deliberately disrespecting the country. For the other players to join them and now say thats not what they meant. Bullshit
Instead of giving the NFL another dime, do what I did and Support a disabled veteran business by getting an awesome NFL =no Fans Left shirt at https://boycott-the-swamp.myshopify.com Hope the ENTIRE COUNTRY gets one and wears it!
NFL sucks now, love politics but just want to watch football............stopped watching my niners last year for one Kapernick's crap and come on people he REALLY REALLY sucks!!
TYT are great!  Congratulations!  I still dig Philip DeFranco, however.
Holy crap. I feel so bad for Weiner's (ex) wife. Poor woman doesn't deserve that.
Phil, im not from the US i dont live in the US either but viewing your videos and coming across this one i wanted  ask... the entire drama with the kneeling and standing form something someone in your country believes in , is freedom and it should be respected, right? but where im lost is that if people have issue with someone expressing themselves how they want and get called names of worse why dont those same people stand against BIG companies that make money from selling clothing reflecting the US flag?...  isnt this also consider a form of disrespectful regardless on whether or not some believe is a form of carrying the love for country with in clothing? just trying to get a grip on the reality we in right now... since the entire world is watching :)
how many times has trump disrespected our country and no one calls him out on it and when they do its called fake news its sad that he is allowed to get someone fired because he wants to show how big he is? wow America i hope he demands others to get fired for his ego maybe then people will open there eyes
You can't run for office with that last name lmao
Tony Romo has 2 playoff wins and Tim Tebow has 1. Come on! You hire people to check stuff like this.
I think america's obsession with their flag is kinda weird and unsettling. But of course in my experience, nationalism only ends up being a double edged sword
I don't know, at this point the NFL should just stop the national anthem from being played during games temporarily just to simmer down the conflict,  and just get to the game.
this is ridiculous, not standing is a right. Its the same as not standing during the pledge of allegiance, whether that be in school or in a sport.
I will always stand and respect our flag and anthem, but I I respect the right of other not to. However, what many are forgetting is that the players are employees. It would be well within the rights of a business owner to fire them as they were hired to play a game, not make a political statement.
Being patriotic is a great way to become a racist. The flag is a piece of cloth. We don't need these things.\n\nBut someone who'd disrespect their own country in the way the NFL did don't sound to me like they have anyone's best interests at heart. It's those who appreciate America who can do the most good making it better. Anti-American actions like taking a knee only give support to those who want to see America toppled. Stand with America, and see it heal instead. You have to care about your country to mend it.\n\nI say this as an Englishman who can see what a fucked up place America is. But damn guys, respect the place you owe so much of you success to! If you wanna join a Black Lives Matter protest do that on your free time.
earth is flat
White House > NFL + NBA
I live in Canada and I am in the Canadian navy and I just don’t think this would never happen here, but as an active member in the navy I would feel sad too see Canadians ever doing this but everyone one does have the right to free of speech and protest. I would have tired a different less harsh approach to the situation the trump did.
Obama was the one who divided us more then any other, it'd sad they can't see that
Saying NFL players are protesting the flag is like saying Rosa Parks was protesting public transportation.
Not in handcuffs , but out work lol..
What disease does weener have?
Mickey mantle doesn't pay my rent
Stop commenting.
Just gotta say lebron james- SHOTS FUCKIN FIRED xD that burn was beautiful
ja
Yay NASCAR
affect our AGENDA yeah exactly fucker !
As stated in our declaration of independence, whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government.  Regardless of what the protesting is about these people are kneeling because there is a problem and they want to make change which is their god given right as American citizens. The first step to solving a problem is admitting that there is one which is exactly what these role models of society are doing while they exercise their first amendement rights.
I dont get how people are saying “ Those players are at work. They shouldn’t do/ say anything that could cause division just bc they have a certain view and they should have consequences for doing so.“ and are siding with Trump, yet Trump is at all times the president or “on the job”, but he can say incredible bullshit that could easily cause division, yet he goes unpunished ? How hypocritical is that ? Do not pick and choose certain principles to apply just because they line up with your OWN. On another note every player has their own reason to kneel, how are you to assume they are doing so to show blatant disrespect for our fallen women/men. I highly doubt any of them are kneeling for that reason.
I'm with NFL. It's a beautiful protests for a good cause and Trump should just stop making shit big. These players are acknowledging that there are these flaws in America and until they are fixed, they do not want to proudly stand to the anthem and I get it. Especially for the minority background or race players, this is important. If I came to America, I would be a minority. If there were enough lithuanians to be mistreated and heard about, I would dp the same
You all realize that he dose this every time that there are more important this happening in the world. I understand that the protest by the players is important, but it has been going on for so long that it is back burner news. Trump used this to cover up his failure to get aid to those in Puerto Rico properly and on time as well it's a bigger distraction from him trying to start war with North Korea. There is a bigger picture here. Why are you falling for his shit Phil. Don't be part of the masses! Please! It's one of the things I love about u and ur show
You guys over on that side of the pond need to chill, no need to be triggered when someone doesn't stand for the anthem/flag xD
Trump is condeming people for expressing their freedom of speech peacefully and rexpectfully, when it takes two days for him to make a small comment on teh KKK saying extremely racist and terrible things, and immediately goes on a rant about people peacefully protesting about social injustice, this reveals him as truly unamerican at heart.
On the whole standing for the national anthem thing, I feel like Trump is really driving a hyper-nationalist narrative.  You respect the flag or you're fired.  It is divisive, and I think Phil hit on a great point, the kneeling was in protest of social issues originally (specifically around policing).  I'm of the same mindset as a certain German scientist who once said, Nationalism is an infantile disease, it's the measles of humanity.  It seems the president is using his Nationalist rhetoric to create in-groups and out-groups, those who agree with or support the players, and those who do not.  Sad.
To be honest, I don't agree with kneeling during he anthem. I was raised the way that when the anthem comes on, I stand and put my hand over my heart (yes even in my house). However, I do believe police brutality is an incredible problem and should be protested. Do it like the Cowboys did it. Kneel before the anthem. But during show some respect.
The most problematic thing I find with the NFL/Trump thing is that he's calling to fire these athletes when they are expressing freedom of speech/expression. The President is going against freedom of expression by wanting to remove these players from their platform and that's very troublesome.
im curious, if someone gets fired because they kneeled, would that be considered wrongful termination?
The problem here is trump. There are bigger problems in the u.s. He should worry about those problems. They're expressing in a nonviolent way. Good for them. It blows my mind the way the leader, the president, expresses himself. He does not act like a professional.
I'm disliking DeFranco's videos more and more. How much can a whiny liberal gush and bleed over nothing?
Blind nationalism and blind following of political party are the sole reasons Trump is in office.
About the NFL, don't be mad, they were kneeling to pray to Jesus that they would win the game. And they were kneeling so they could worship the flag.
I don't stand for the pledge or the flag. I hate Trump thats one reason. Two, I respect soldiers that have died, and I show my respect in many different way. I just refuse to stand for the pledge because I'm an atheist and I dislike the under God part.
What boycott?  Week 3 was 3% UP over 2016.  The alt-right, sycophantic Trump drones are either lying about boycotting or lying about being fans in the first place.
With all the shit going on right now we are wasting the power of the government arguing about glorified games a flag is only as meaningful as the people willing to die for it but those people gave there lifes to allow you the right to shit on it part of freedom of speech is that everyone has it  i disapprove of what you say, but i will defend to the death your right to say it there is more important things then worring what a bunch of over payed athletes are doing when we fix all the other horse shit thats happening then we can focus on this problem if we haft to
I think the NFL situation is ludicrous. The same people who spout how everything that is negative about Trump is fake news but they pass around the fake NFL rule talking about how players /should/ stand at attention when the anthem is played when this is not even mentioned at all. Let alone the page that the rule is apparently on even existing. I think people should calm the hell down and maybe get angry at the cause of them kneeling and not them kneeling during the anthem.
In regards to standing for the national anthem or not, I think the most important part of this argument is being glossed over. What's important is to ask yourself will this action bring the results I want? If you're going to put your million dollar career on the line and risk offending millions of people, including those who cheer for you and pay your bills, at least make sure your results will be worth the risk!\nDid refusing to stand end racism? Did it call attention to the issue in a way that didn't ruin your career (like Beyonce's half time performance for example)?  Did it make African Americans look good? Did it soften people's hears toward African Americans? Did it stop police killing African American kids? That's what really matters. So should you really continue doing this? They say the definition of insanity is doing the SAME thing over and over, expecting DIFFERENT results...
You forgot to mention that Colin Kapernick wore socks that depicted police officers as pigs on the field and the NFL had no problem with that..  If he has a problem with the police as he used to say, instead of the flag, why not turn your backs on all police officers that are all around the field and stadium as security to protect the players and keep the peace??? Hmmm
There is no confusion. Everyone knows why theyre doing. Either for the mistreatment of black people by police or to say FU Trump. We all know. The problem is youre using our National anthem that has nothing to do with police or Trump to protest. It pisses us off. It is disrespectful. Your intent doesn't matter. You dont use our flag and you dont use our National anthem. They stand for our great country that gave you the chance to be the privileged men you are. The anthem is to remember the men and women who have died for this country, for you! Its to respect the men and women that are in the military right now. They have their right to protest however they want it doesnt mean theyre not aholes for doing it.
That Liverpool badge looks strange
wonder why he said Sturridge
His English is great 👍
He should have a better rating
Van Dijk may be the only player that gets fifa ratings
Sturridge wen his fit JUST COME TO LIVERPOOL VIRGIL VAN DIJK
much better than alli and so much humble
When he said: Sturridge, when he's fit 😂
Liverpool fans are annoyed
Im surprised how good his english is
I would personally like to see you allow the player to write his own stats before he sees what EA gave him. Spice things up a bit.
VVD knows. Fit Studge 🔥🔥
Haha he had to say Sturridge
If he went liverpool he would have been a 85 for sure
Seems like a nice guy
His rating next year will skyrocket once he joins LFC
Van dijk and Keita for us next TW I hope.. Although Keita already signed for 2018 season
Keep the footballers reacting to stats videos coming
Rio talking to a Loserpool player. Errrrr.... error 404!!! 😂😂😂\nRio talking to a Southampton player.*
Should give the player the blank card first to make these videos more interesting
My mans got that 8g Physical.
he looks like offset from migos LOL
Van Dijk come to Liverpool in January pleaseee 😭😭😭
I think Virgil's rating for himself is more deserving than his current rating. Don you think?
He said sturigge and Aguero because he wants to move to LFC and MC
You should give ask them for their predictions first ffs
What a legend Rio Ferdinand is, top man
Lol why does it look like Van Dijk is wearing a Van Dijk mask in the thumbnail 😂
He wants to go to either Liverpool or city
He’s smoking, I’ll burn him
Sturridge when he's fit... He wants Liverpool so bad... And we want him likewise
welcome to LFC in January.
He's got to come to Liverpool and save our defense
Just get to Liverpool
His card he wrote in would be worth 500k plus
83 is a joke hes at least 87
What a tank in video game and real life
I think there's a mistake on the title he plays for Liverpool not Southampton c'mon get your act together
Big up the fs&hg tune
They don't give high pace to CB's to avoid them from being overpowered, annoying but whatever. Also, Dutch people have excellent English.
He's happy except from the badge on the card
They got the wrong team
Would be the most used defender in the game
Should they put they're ratings in before you show them?
The stats are perfect but the passing is meant to be 72 or73
Lower the passing by 10 and pace by 5 he deserves an 84. Quality CB
I'd love to play a game against rio he seems like a sound guy and easy to get past
Rio tell him he will nothing if he moves to liverpook
Looks a little bit like Alli when he's laughing…
Wait those stats are wrong... it says 69 dribbling but he actually has 70 on Fifa 18
What are those cards made of always wondered
He wouldn't have those stats at Liverpool after conceding 50+ goals a year
Very good defender. Sturridge and Aguero do pull defenders away because they're always running at a different velocity. And of course VVD wants a move to either club so can't knock the brotha for saying that.
His english is better than rooney\n\n\n\n\nClassic😂
Actually seems like a sound guy tbf
2 big beasts
Did he say sturridge
Everybody thinks they're better.
With lukaku
85 passing hahaha his funny
Free van dijk

He be a Liverpool player in January
Ferdinand son van dijk is gonna be great
Van Dijk Come to Liverpool
Van dijk should be higher in everything 😂
How the hell does he have the same physique as Akinfenwa?...dont get me wrong, he is very strong but compared to Akinfenwa? No way..
first
The thing is they need it to be a little balanced like 68 shooting wtf
I think Sturridge is better than Firmino when he isnt injured. Sturridge is actually great at football. But he really never gets play time either. Firmino was good like 1-2 seasons ago. But he havent rly done anything yet.
U didn't show him his bloody FIFA 18 card rio
Van dijk is the only CB that can save Liverpool tbh \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen again I love to see Liverpool suffer 😂
Wow Rio interviewing a Liverpool player now..oh wait..
Do it with man utd players
What the... when did he ever face off against Studge?
The man, still miss him up in Glasgow one of the best players I've ever seen wear the hoops 🍀
Would be a good fit at United but put off with this whole liverpool link. Hope he shows a desire for united n something can happen. Always saw him as a perfect rio replacememt and an upgrade on smalling.
Guys I am from Holland van dijk Will never go to Liverpool he wants to go to Arsenal because of dutch players they had denis bergkamp,Marc overmars,Glenn helder
When is fifa 18 coming out
How can this man say sturridge is one of the hardest he has played against he literally had him in his pocket the hole match in the league cup
Rio wants to be having a little chat with VVD about a cheeky switch to Old Trafford.
Awesome Lady, very creative of her !!!
I write inspirational stories. I'd love to write one of your experience. It was amazing.\nEmail me at Heartsandhumor@gmail.com
Awww wish I could join you girl!

THAT.S MY CRAZY AMERICAN PEOPLE !!! MY FAMILY!Love to you!
Funny video on my style...T-shirt from Spartan race! I'm in love now!!!!
This looks so fun, had to watch it twice .
one of the little things that keep God from destroying the world.
Standing out among the badly made egotistical and crappy home-made videos that pepper social media sites is your lovely little piece of work.  Great entertainment and I had to watch it several times in a row!!!  Wish I'd been stuck at the same airport....
Guys this is not a joke, my teacher taught her many years ago! That was her STUDENT!!
is she single?  :) love from israel
I was just in Charlotte. What really jumped out at me was how nice everyone was. Like weirdly friendly. This video validates it. I don't think there are many places where you would have success making this.
This is great! It really made my day! I smiled the whole way through.
This video is not available, why?
THANK you it is good to see that you understand we each have a choice.  YOU made a GOOD choice..
I fall in love with you! Have you instagram?
This made me SO happy! Thank you for the joy ♥
And in the process, you made a lot of peoples' nights better at the airport :)
This is just wonderful!  Thank you so much.
This is exactly what makes America great and not a blonde weirdo.
This is the right approach to life! To choose joy and dance instead of sadness and tears is all a matter of decision

Great idea, Great movie, Great song, you dance just great, your smile is great, you make ma and lot more smile and happy, so you are - great !

An entire crew of people need to do this that get cancelled for weather(airlines don't pay hotel  for weather)
I wanna do that...
This is GREAT!!! Love it.-j
love love love!!!  Thanks for making us smile in Charlotte!!
The thing I envy the most about your sister is the  ability to approach several strangers and ask them to do something fun with her. I feel like if I tried this it would go something like Hey, so I'm doing... a thing... nevermind. followed by running.
Home airport! Love this
great way to pass time and make friends at the airport!
Hey, mad props! I often see fun dancing videos and think to myself it would be even more fun if they could actually dance. You definitely pass that test.
And you can dance girl! Great bunch of worker/dancers too.
I enjoyed this video and OMG, you are also HOT!
amazing that's what I would do :)
Wonderful! You and your new friends are great dancers
I love this girl's spirit!
Well done for such an entertaining vid  @0:49 Do like mummy and daddy version of joining in - even if didn't get out of their seat!  Betcha slept well when you did finally board your plane after all that dancing!
That was glorious!!!!  Well done!!!
That was Brilliant !! :) Well Done. Sending Best Wishes to You All.....All the way from Scotland! xx
All this video does is make me smile. Thanx. That Moonwalk was perfect. In many ways, so are you. Look at my youtube music channel.   https://soundcloud.com/rusty-hornz and   https://www.facebook.com/RustyHornzMusic/?ref=page_homepage_panel
You're so graceful, and what a cute video!!! Now I want to go to the airport and dance. ;-)
You are THE BEST.  Can't tell you how much this cheered me when I needed it - AND you are a great dancer!

Jim: if you weren’t already pregnant\nLouise: then what? \nJim: I would still be married to my wife 😂😂
That’s a beautiful VW Camper😍
I loved this, I miss your vlogs!
I'm fairly sure the campervan in HTR wasn't left hand drive. It also had the newer style white/yellow registration whereas this one had the pre-1973 style black back with white print. \n\nCool vlog.
The special guest that's top secret that's in one of the last clips ;) hahaha
TOM DALEY WAS THERE OH MY 😍
This video made me so Happy!

3rd comment
Does this mean Marcus is finally being normal again?? (I unwatched him after the break up and acting like a shit.) :/
IS TOM DALEY THE ONE AT 5.01?????
I don't get how Jim acts like he and Louise are awesome friends when him and Tanya didn't invite her to their wedding but htey invited Hannah Hart. Jim did a radio show with Louise so you think that they would be better friends than Hannah.
Has anyone else noticed that naomi has just disappeared from the group
The worst meal I ever prepared was the one I made the night I proposed to my wife...  Nerves I guess...  Still married 25 years later though.
This a fantastic example of video sponsorship done right! Awesome job YSAC & Hello Fresh
Is she into you?\n\nc. Can't tell
Nice recipe. I made it for dinner last night. Had to skip some of the cringe. While I was cooking I had to watch on mute. Commentary was too white for me.
is this is how to basic’s successful older brother?
Dude, what year was this made in? That house just reeks of early 80's mixed with a little 50's
My school shows your videos in the morning announcements
What's the name of the sad song you play all the time?
Cucumbers are a fruit, specifically a false berry because they grow from an inferior ovary;( this means that the flower has more than one ovary for growing seeds real berry flowers have one), just like blueberries and cranberries  you should have added them to the ice cream.
someone tell me why the artist thats saying this poem sounds exactly like our host here at you suck at cooking. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhqaerW6yzE
Trying to reach 50 subscribers. Watch our most recent video https://youtu.be/2wL4UCN4EfA
I'll go on your date :'(
I FUCKING LOVE YOU
I can't tell you how much I envy your knife skills. I try to emulate them, but...well, the doc said they couldn't reattach one finger, but did the other, so I should be back at it soo...in a while, few months, year or so. But, I'll keep watching, so I can learn more!!
i think YSAC went through a bad breakup, it's ok just subtly tell us with cucumber slices
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
What ever happened  to Dennis (the egg)?
Pant stainer, is that your nickname at school?
pan stainer HA! \nEveryone, please watch my little nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
*E A R  S Y R U P*
I love how your videos are instructional and also entertaining enough to distract me from the reality of my life that I'm the kind of person that doesn't even get dates with mannequins in wigs not really romantically but just to eat some food I made. But I do eat tasty food so that counts for something maybe kind of like.
This is legitimately sad help
Oh my fucking God. Your videos are soooo good.
Fuck man, I feel like the ending will happen to me
I'll make some for me and...\n\n\n\n\n\nme..?😓
YSAC, sorry your dates dont work out. Invite me over, I'll read all your subliminal messages and even stay for ice cream.
This was deep, who hurt you
Hey! How do you feel about tapenade? I think you could make a great tapenade video.
I just made this and it was honestly so good
Dude. You could have cooked ramen with raw fish on top, burned the water, let all the steam escape, your personality is what would have made it happen.
Fek. That hit me hard in the feel dangit.
I am a very tall midget
Do it. Or dont do it. It's your life. \n\n*a second later*\n\nSubscribe or die
Hello Fresh is the culinary equivalent of Tinder: Looks great on paper, but it's going to be a let-down once you try it out.
That moment when your name is Shannon

There are SO MANY ways to spice up cheap ramen noodles! You should do a vid on some of them. **This idea is trademarked. You will owe me $608.00 if you use it. Cutting you some slack 'cause good content.**
Made this for my parents without the cucumbers
Question! Why did you put the 0 under your finger?
The steps taken to sabotage yourself is the best.

Wow, pretty dark video on this one, eh?

Let's do a simple look..nope! 0 to 100 real quick. A forever struggle of mine😂
You dont love your nose now, but five years from now, people may be telling their plastic surgeons to give them a Carli Bybel nose. You are beautiful. God never makes mistakes.
Beautiful! A deep, dark purple eye look! Xo
Plastic surgery on her chin sooooo obvs but still love ya xx

Please do colourpop yes please palette or Peach palette plz.
I would love to see you experiment with purple and deep navy blue!!
I love you Carli😍 I always love the way you do make up😊
Hey Carli my Favourite Acne spot treatment is from Dermalogica ! It's their over night clearing Gel and there Sebum Masque! The over night clearing gel really helps to try and prevent bacteria from spreading and calming the pimple down ! If I feel like my pimple is being stubborn I'll take my dermalogica sebum masque and leave it on the spot overnight and that usually dries it's and flatens the pimple especially if I squeezed it the day before and damaged the skin I find this helps a lot. Both of these products shouldn't burn your skin dermalogica is amazing but gentle! Give it a go and see if that helps. Love this look Btw so beautiful.
Where did u get that top? Makeup is stunning 😍
Could you do purple makeup look?
Is first aid beauty cruelty free? I heard they weren't anymore :(
Hello Carli I am planning to start being a You-tuber but I am on the hunt for some easy to use editing tools that are either free or low cost for windows 10. I love watching all of your videos and  vlogs. Love you xoxox

Idk if its just me but I don't like the lighting on this video I feel like you can't actually see the truth colors and it suddenly get really dark, idk it's just distracting. I love Carly I'm not hating ok? Jut being honest
If you find a great acne skincare routine please do a video on it cause I have the same issue. Thanks.
Tea tree oil works great for pimples!
If you’re vegan and getting acne still. Theres too much oil in your diet. Cut the oil down Carli.

Here's why you should get the iPhone X over the Galaxy S8:\nNo headphone jack,\nIP67 (not IP68)\nNo home button\nNo fingerprint sensor\nNo iris scanner\nBig sensor cutout at top\nOLED display (half as bright as S8 approx. and made by Samsung)\nGlass back of phone\nFast charging charger not included\n1125P (not 1440P)\n458ppi (not 571ppi)\nNo gigabyte LTE\nEarpod headphones (no AKGs)\nUSB Type C\nNo LED notification light\nNFC locked to Apple Pay
Hey Mark, can you make some videos on home projectors... Thanks!
Man what the fuck are you talking about? We came for info on the iPhone x, not electric cars, dumbass.
Are the speakers on the iPhone X going to be loud like the 8 plus or will they be a downgrade
How is Apple Pay going to work?
I'm in Denmark and it's already widely known as iPhhone X not 10
iPhone 8 and 10? What about iPhone 9?
What ever happened to the maingear shift that he had?
Hi Marques, I love your videos! Do you think the iPhone X should be on the market? I mean, it's as powerful as a MacBook, and who needs that much power for a phone? Even the most intensive Gaming apps won't use that much power. So, do you think the iPhone X should be on the market or should it be rebranded as 5.8 inch MacBook running iOS?
I’ll take the 8 Plus please.
will face ID consumes a lot of batteries?
What happened to the App Store wishlist??
Hey MKBHD,\n\nFirst, love the Earth, Wind and Fire plug lol. Will you be doing a review of the Apple Watch Series 3? That would be great and greatly appreciated, please and thank you!
Are u gonna review the watch series 3?
Marques is so composed it would be amazing watching him getting torn down by those wings.
Iphone is the best \n1. Much faster \n2. The best camera  \n3. Better hardware and software integration \n4. iOS updates when you want them \n6. The best apps first \n7. No bloatware\n8. Works beautifully with macs \n9. Apple pay \n10. Family sharing \n11. Best support and help\n12 . iMessage
Are you a wrestling fan and 2k games??
From what I understand, induction charging is coming to Audi electric cars as early as 2018/2019
Isn't the swipe for home screen gesture gonna cause an interruption while in a game?
he has a quadro sitting in the back being a macbook weight
I think once Apple adds fingerprint readers in the display FaceID will stay and it will be optional to have it scan your face and a finger to be place on the screen at the same time for even greater security. What do you think?
Reachgate 💀
He chose my question!!! :DDD

*Looks at guy watching movie on iPhone X*\n\nHey, um, dude, you're, um...you're MISSING PART OF THE SCREEN!
Reachability is possible with Assistive touch on iOS, so there's your home button to use it. Also getting quick access to control center and the new lock screen (notifications) and you can set it up with the quick access YOU want/need + since they now made Double tap, and long press settings possible on it with latest iOS 11 update beside it has 3D Touch on it also, it should be the same on the iPhone X. So one hand use should not be a problem, because Assistive touch is like a home button. Make it your own! 👈😎
Well time to by the Iphone 3
at first i was like why is he saying porsche like that but now i realize i've been saying it wrong the whole time lol
MOST likely skipped the gold because it's a stainless steel body instead of aluminum.
Why are you not using a over on your iPhone 8 Plus? 😱
wait, how do you pronounce Porsche again?
I don't thin the sensor works in low light meaning you will spend half the day using your password to get in your phone...

Not a big fan of the facial recognition stuff so far. My friend has the Note 8 and I just grab it, point it at her face, it unlocks, and I run away with her phone. Is this what better security is?
Could you please make a video on Fuscia OS. Could it replace Android.

Should I get the 9 inch or the 12 inch dildo??????
Is it worth buying the iPhone se in 2017. And if Apple will bring the A11 chip in the se, then I guess it would be worth buying. Please guide. I don't have much to invest
I don't care who corrects me. Saying iPhone x sounds better than saying iPhone 10.

Помогите пожалуйста набрать 100 подпищиков
She's so inspirational. I love you Katy! ❤️
Katy I have a bad immune system and I was supposed to see you on October 11th but I can’t cause I can get really sick. And I’m really upset. I saw you for your Prismatic World Tour and now I can probably not see you in concert. I have an auto immune disease that I’m always at doctors and I don’t have a normal life. I’m 14 and most of my life I’ve been sick or at doctors. And getting blood taking and getting infusions and shots every week. And I’m struggling to stay caught up in school and keep friends and deal with my auto immune disease that me and my brother and Mom have. Every time I’m upset I listen to your music cause it makes me happy and forget what I’m going through. And because I’m a DJ I always play your music. And I have trouble talking to people about what I go through and when I listen to your music when I’m upset or happy or at doctors or getting my infusions or just at a random time it always makes me happy. You are my role model and my favorite person in the whole world. I know you probably won’t see this but I hope you do and respond cause it would mean a lot to me. Thank you
Her career ended so early so bad
Is math related to science?
I love Katy but I dunno why she reminds me of Roman attwood just a little more skinny
No I won't
she said my name during the live :((((((((
I dont understand why she's puting this out at the same time as Gaga's Documentary
Should i have to mention that in the album there's 3 katy, and then, if you will count her eyes, it will be 6, and 3 katys × 6 eyes = 666??!!\nYOU SHOULD WAKE UP
This is what you called evolution of a star.
Just wanna see you with Taylor be close again because fans are full of hatred they always comparing you for nothing they are the one makes you two worst. Btw i'm swifties and at the same time im also a katy cats
Saw her in Boston last night, She was a goddess for sure
Can't wait!Love you Katy!
we're witnessing a FLOP ERA

How cute they are i mean the dad and daughter isn't adorable together ?
Amazing, as always!!!! Love that Dave's on The Voice- his talent is what drives Claire.
Who is him? I dont know ? Someone plz tell me?
am i the only les mis fan who's crying over the memory of george blagden singing this
Omg YES i am so excited he picked Adam WOW YES
The rasp <3
Death Cab for Cuties!
“I’m obsesssed with herrr” same Miley same lol
hooooooooooooooooooooooooray. Good job Dave <3
Claire's reaction. OMGGG
From a fellow WASHINGTONIAN Tacoma born and raised and still reside and a Claire Fan, kudos to you dad! Super Super Proud of you! Go get em'
I'm rooting on you, man! 👏
who else replaying the video when his daughter singing. that's best part!!!
This was pure and beautiful. Thank you.
He is my favourite so far
Dave Crosby is the best singer ever and he’s gorgeous. He is obviously a great dad and husband too if you watch his daughter’s channel. They are awesome!!!
Overrated
Adam's reaction at 1:30. Hahahaha lmfao
Ellen brings me here
Their daughter looks like Lara Wurtzbach Manze
Whats The Song Called @ 6:28
*LOVE YOU Claire and the Crosbys*
Claire is delightful but Dave....what a wonderful voice and such honestly.  It was beautiful!  Go, go, go!
Check out me and my bro.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9YDQyKzEPA
Who's here from Claire and the Crosbys? 😂

Every time I see this family on video singing or just being who they are in their vlogs, I tear up. They are such a really sweet family. Ever since I saw the video of them singing see the light from the Tangled movie, I fell in love with them. Dad has an AMAZING voice and Clair does as well. And what a little cutie. Love this family'
Ahhhh....  yesssss...  I'm crying happy tears for Dave.  I've been following their channel since I first saw Claire sing the song from the Little Mermaid.  Their family always brightens my day!  Congrats Dave!  <3
The winner.. I hope!! :D
You take good care of the Crosbys!
I always love J Hudson’s reactions.
that song and this is cute and she is good
What I always say is If u lose The Voice, then u can try for X Factor and Agt, Bgt and etc.
Why are successful vocalists always attractive? Can unattractive vocalists have a long, lasting career in the music business?
If he gets to live playoffs where America votes then he automatically wins.  He is already so popular and has won the hearts of millions.  All Adam has to do if he wants to win this is not mess up and not make the wrong choice (like he has so many times in the past...).
Yes! Go Claire and the Crosbys . Awesome. Congrat. Hello from Washington State
What a boring and cheesy song.
Why is Miley still judge? Is she mentally stable now?
so is this guy gonna win the voice cause of his daughter?
Dave, is going on the voice going to interfere with you going to the planet Kolob, where god lives????
dave's voice is good❤️
I watched this in music class
For so long says Miley.
Omg! Sooooo excited that Dave Crosby is going to be on The Voice!! Love the Crosby Family!! Claire is such a sweetheart! Omg!!!! So excited!!
props to jennifer for that question, or else we wouldn't be able to hear claire sing (moms account )
j hudson is a stuck up boring coach
Carson gets so excited for everyone getting a chair turned around. It deflates and waters down the excitement.
OMG I just realised she is Miley Cyrus
Is this The Voice ?\nHe's whispering ! 😱
Death Cab For Cutie's Ben is repping my city how crazy!
Ugh I'm so happy for this!! I missed out on his audition on Tv D:
And miley is the queen any way😍😍
Great voice control but it's kinda weak. Idk maybe he was saving it for that song, I just hope he has more
His daughter's reaction is priceless :)
I'm so obsessed! He's amazing
why do the audience always feel the need to clap in rhythm ....
Another potential winner by the voters..
I just was thinking a few weeks ago they should go on this or Americas got tallent I'm so happy and Dave and Clair need to go on Americas got tallent
What a voice. Precious daughter. Beautiful family. Love how the Voice celebrates real people and their dreams. Hat's off to management.
Dave Crosby: I Will Follow You into the Dark
I AM IN TEARS
Now he should sing a David Crosby's song to close the circle :)
Hey I hate to be that guy but his dang singing made me cry because this song makes me think of exr\nAlso from his amazing voice\nBut primarily exr
that little angel is a future artist way to go.
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
Why??? Why is Miley there? She is so bad!
What is the name of the song at 6:27?
So adorable!!! Hope he wins.
I cried
Countinho
wow dave congratssss my idol and ur cutiiieeee pie baby
So awesome
Omggg GO DADDEH
Yeayyy, team Adam!! :) ;)
I LOVE THERE CHANEL
I’m cryin
this lil love is the sweetest and purest soul i ever heard so far! OMG!
the whole family is so cute omg
He has a beautiful voice he has  fans already around the world he has a chance to win
At 1:44 Jennifer Hudson be like: Darn he's cute!
You've got a FAN in me!\n\n#Goosebumps!
I am so happy he chose Adam. Adam chose Dave first even before knowing that he is a famous YouTuber!
Love you claire 😍😍😍
God bless the Crosbys!! Beautiful family!! 😍😍😍
The Crosbys!!!!
Soooo cute!
Thank you for  subtitles...
Hope Dave wins
Woah!! Perfection.
Finally !!!!!! good luck dave !!!  :DDDDDDDD
sounds like nevershoutnever
More power to him, but while he was ok, his voice doesn't compare with most of the other contestants. I doubt he will make it past the battle round unless paired with a particularly weak singer, or unless the song choice is one that is especially suited to him. Comments like Raphael Wong's are the key to his success: who else replaying the video when his daughter singing. that's best part!!!
Claire watching the voice  she said one day I'm gonna be there now Dave was on the stage!I'm so excite for him
Good Luck Dave . I am sure you will succeed in everything you do . Well done #Dave .
YAAAAS A MORMON!
The Voice would’t be the same without Adam and Blake
I was thinking of 'Hey hey, it's Ty Ty' then I realized this is a different show. And that little girl is amazing! God bless this family! 😘

Awwwww
Beauty products for redheads video?
You should prank call fans!
AHHHH RIVERDALE COMES OUT 2 DAYS BEFORE MY BIRTHDAY
he is nothing without big case...... no certified G
Strowman might as well turn face, at this point.
Issa Certified Plane...Bada Boom Flying helicopters in the room. How you doin?
I love the way Braun just grabs them like their toys. He's so manly. Why can't more guys be like this?
You just make a list!!!
Roses are Red \nViolets are Blue\nNew NEXUS.,\nWhat a DEBUT!
Enzo talks too much!
That was beutiful..
omg
Is this even canon?
Enzo is a trooper! Guy deserves a back rub.
I can't figure out if the whole cruiserweight have turned heel or Enzo has turned heel
Mess!!!!!!!!! 😠
Screw enzo
Has Braun gotten fat?
It just turned from bad to worse for Enzo
I hope they have a PPV match. And Enzo kicks him in the balls and Braun just shakes his head, and powerslams him to win. That would be funny.
As god as my witness......he's gotta be dead!!!
What a disrespect to enzo they are worth nothing
What the name of music in the end
Enzo just got raped by 12 people and the fans liked it
Oh so when Shane attacks an employee he gets yelled  at  but when the 205 live division attacks amore nothing happens wow creative
This is a serious topic please read-:\nWWE you are getting worst day by day in earning.Now WWE really have only maximum 3to 4 thousand peoples to buy tickets and watch live and half of arena is empty!I know that.\nYou should really have to make fast changes to bring WWE back on line-:\n1. End the PG \n2. End the New era\n3. End the brand split because its not working!\nMake these changes to save WWE!!
Braun is awesome👍 Enzo got his butt kicked and you can teach that👊
enzo is one hell of a seller holy sh-
3:07 I think he dead
Braun is the senior😅😅
All u want to Kill him...
Enzo deserved it ...... but that was too much!
Les not act like they didn't use v trigger and young bucks super kick
Braun and Zo are friends in real life tho.
Look at the face of enzo on 3:08
that was really sweat
why this happened to enzo??
Who are the heels and faces here
This was a terrible segment and I'm not even a Enzo fan. Why put the belt on him just to look weak ?
big cass must be laughing his A off from that hospital bed
Jack Gallagher looks like he is on the verge of turning heel
3:14: Enzo think of himself what's the reason to live
0:45 - did... did his rib cage just cave in?
Stop he's already dead.
if I was enzo I will fight back just be friends with enzo fine if you guys don't lisen to me when I'm big I'm gonna kick all of and put your teeth down your throts you guys are mean people because you don't respect enzo amore
And yet, everybody still thinks Big Cass was being a douche. He was just the first to think little enzo speaks too much and it won't be the last time. The only guy to have a worst timing than enzo was when Bo Dallas came to the ring to tell Brock Lesnar to Bolieve after the big guy lost a match (against Taker I think)
it would be cool if all the (non Enzo) cruiserweights did something similar to the nexus, but not just on 205 live to enzo, to bigger guys too!
I think his punishment for being a douche is over now.
3:16 Is that all you can do?
This was scripted. At 2:50 while they was dragging Enzo into the corner, Enzo lifted his knee up to get into the corner. The WWE are doing this to promote the cruiserweight divison. They are using Enzo as a way to bring the entertainment back into the cruiserweight division. That is probably why they had all the cruiserweights came into the ring to put on a show. Is it true that the WWE is really getting rid of the cruiserweight division?
At least WWE was listening to the comments when we said “send Braun Strowman to 205 Live” 😂
2:29\n Stop it! I can't see nothing.
Hahahaha savage Enzo amore got what he deserved no one will save him Enzo look who's tough now buddy
U guys hating on this segment are totally marking out. It’s working. This should’ve been on tv. Enzo is a hell of a seller I’ll say that.
Can anyone else hear enzo saying stop it at 2:26
Didnt have to put in the fake cheers guys
The way Cedric Alexander slammed enzo I thought he broke his neck
This has no commentators, so am i right in thinking this was just for the crowd and not on Raw itself?
I like how the ring sounds
This is what happens when you bad mouth Cena Enzo.... Golden Shovel.

Try https://www.audible.com/numberphile and check out The Mathematics of Love by Hannah Fry\n\nEnvy free cake cutting (the paper mentioned): https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03655 --- A clarifying note from Hannah: n^n^n^n^n^n is the *maximum* number of cuts in the n person case.
that is not a cake
Today i needed to cut a round meal in three equal parts. First I cut a line from the middle to one edge. Then I searched on my phone on google for an image of 120° angle and divided the meal following the lines of the angle.
Sharing a cake? That's alien concept to me.
Why not just cut the cake into 6 pieces, and each person gets 2?
That's a lot of cutting.\n\nI recommend ditching the other two and splitting a cake with just one person.\n\nHoney? Ears?  Ew.
Flip it on it's side and measure it.  Then you are cutting a rectangle and everyone gets a flat round piece.
Just cut the cake into 1/4s, then cut the 4th piece into 1/3rds
Why not just cut the cake, rotate it exactly 120 degrees, cut again, rotate it 120 degrees, and final cut?
3^(3^3) ≈ 19000... Now that can't be right
Whomever cuts the cake, gets the last piece.  Pretty easy and pretty likely to ensure even cuts.
Wouldn't it be simplier to just buy a knife with 120 degree angles
Buy a very sensitive scale... problem solved for any n (and in way less cuts)
How about cutting the fucken cake into a fucken 120 degree angle? Then there wont be any dispute...\nPS: you got some shitty friends m8
On the I cut,you choose method,couldn't you just get alice to cut,bob to choose,then Charlie chooses\nthis seems like it would work.
It's impossible since you can't divide by three...You can only approximate.
Or you could cut the cake in to 6 equal pieces and everybody get's 2 pieces.
or you could just cut the cake into three uneven slices and just fight to the death like we normally do
This is helping me sleep
Hannah can pour anything in my ear...
make the cake in to sixes. quite easy first cut half (very easy) then cut over the center so that it makes sixes then person #1 gets biggest and smallest #2 gets next largest and next smallest an the 3rd person gets two pieces almost equally as big. the rank is decided democratically
So confused, explanation should have been better.
We've got three people;\nAlice,\nBob, and\nCharlie\n\n....bob...*cracks up laughing*
The only way to fairly split a piece of cake with several others is to ask the waitress to bring extra forks and everyone eats from it in the center of the table.
How to eliminate envy: drown that motherfucker in brain-hurting confusion.
I would love to see how this is explained to 3 6-year-olds when they are having a cake.
Put cake in blender. Blend until smooth. Pour out equal portions. Drink cake.
That was a horrible, horrible cake.
There is simpler way: divide it by four; distribute the pieces; then divide the remaining by four; distribute the pieces; then divide the remaining by four; distri.... (ad infinitum).
Person 1 slices 1 slice. Person 2 takes slice or passes. Person 3 takes slice or passes it to person 1. One person without cake slices remainder, other person chooses.
Put the cake in a blender for delicious cake smoothies.
2^x/3 is not an integer number.
act is as if you are cutting it into 6 pieces and just give everyone 2 pieces, done, or you can partially cut the cake into 6 pieces and then draw two out for one person, that would be alot easier.
always cut everything into 12ths, including pizza, for optimal friendly sharing
Or just accept the rounding error when it is cut in three pieces: the programmer's way :)
Now try this with elementary school children and see if they won't find a reason to bash their heads. ;)
the title of this video is wrong. the exercise is not about getting equal slices but about satisfying preferences.
I thought they would take the hexagon route.
This is overly complicated. Also why the cuckold metaphor?
If you are obsessed with slicing a cake then use an angle mesure.
I have a question\n10 * 0^1 = 0 is correct.\nA = 10\nB = 0^1\nC = 0\n\nA * B = C is still correct.\nLets transpose.\nA * B = C\n---------\n      B\nA = C\n       -\n       B\nSo 10 = 0\n               -\n               0^1\n???
I would pick the one that had been touched the least.
What if Bob unfairly trims the piece and makes it really small , with the second choice he can always get one of the two slightly larger pieces and Alice will be screwed
I'll take the smallest piece to not have to go through this exercise.
I would cut in half, then into quarters. Each person takes a quarter, and then you cut the remaining quarter into 3 slices.
Just have the person who cuts the cake eat last.
This is insane - one will just end up with a little pile of crumbs when cutting the trimming. Easier to use a protractor than this!
Could this solution work?\nPerson 1 cuts the cake pieces.\nPerson 2 assigns a cake piece to each person.\nPerson 3 switches any two pieces of cake.
Dividing circles into thirds is a very annoying task, because there is no simple on-the-spot mathematical way of cutting it like so. Sure, a compass would help, but who has a compass around when cutting pizza? I sure don't, hah.
If only you were as attentive to words as you are to fractions. You don't share a cake between three people; you share it among three (or more) people. Between is for two and only two.
I remember how I once applied the 2 person version of this to candies when I was 8 Years old:\nWe got 12 small candies and 1 big candy with a friend that we had to share. We both wanted to big candy so I proposed that I would make two piles of candy and he could choose then.\nI put the big candy alone on one pile, and all the small candies on the other.\nAfter he saw this, he just replied with: that's unfair!
Too many people with their hands on the cake.
There is another way to do this\nPerson A cuts a piece of cake and gives it to person B. Person B can choose to cut it or leave it. Then person C can choose to cut it or leave it. The last person who cuts gets the cake. Therefore, if A cuts more than a third, person B or C will cut off a miniscule bit and eat the big piece. If A cuts off less than a third, B and C don't cut it so A must eat the small piece. Therefore, if A, B and C all know this, A will try to cut as close to one third as he can.\nAfter this there will be two people and two third of the cake left. Those people will just use the cut or choose method.
I'd just blend it, and divide by weight....
Why not just give the trimming to the person with the smallest slice?
Charlie seems to risk getting shafted here. If by chance, when he first choses his major portion, he feels all pieces are equal, his choice is arbitrary, and he gets a fair main portion. He then cuts the trimming pieces fairly, and gets a fair trimming portion. Since alice and bob each end up with slightly ABOVE what they feel is fair, Charlie has a relatively smaller value, since he's getting only what he thinks is fair, not fair plus extra\n\nthe same problem seems to arise when bob agrees with the portions decided by alice and charlie in their respective steps, i.e. when Choosing first doesnt confer an actual advantage. rare but possible :)
this gotta be the dumbest thing on numberphile
Or, you know, you could just cut the cake into 6 pieces with precision and each person gets 2 pieces of their choosing. The smaller the pieces the easier it is to make them the same size.
You simply make enough cake, so there is still some left when all people have eaten what they want. If you need to be this exact with cutting what you have, then you have not made enough cake, and you are a terrible host.
Why do I feel that this is very pointless? Why not just cut into 3 equal pieces??
I think my family will use this for cutting camembert equally. We fight about it a lot
But who is going to cut the cake first? :/
Cut it in 12 pieces, 4 every person.\n\nDone.
Just buy a $10 scale off of amazon if your friends are this weird.
just get a gram scale
just cut the cake in half then in x then each take 2 pieces like a medium pizza
Aka how to divvy up weed without  scales.
easy!!!!!!!!!!! weigh the cake pieces before you share.............................
I think after this no one will eat the cake 🙁
Interesting technique - the generalization to ethics is obvious - the solution tries to satisfy their preferences in a fair way in some sense. There is a problem though - an envy free solution is not necessarily optimal. Counterexample - person 1 loves frosting, person 2 hates frosting, person 3 likes a mixture of cake and frosting. If person 3 chooses the first set of slices then they could make three slices with frosting and cake in every slice without regard to other people's preference. The end result in obviously suboptimal  - the best would be one slice with only frosting, one slice with only cake and one slice with a mixture.
Dr. Hannah Fry is my favourite red head.
There is a major error in your calculations; \nyou don't share a cake with friends. you eat the cake, then share the photos of the cake with friends.
I'm vegan so I don't eat regular cake anyway but how much each person gets, depends on each individuals tolerance and how high/stoned each one of the 3 persons wants to get.
Just get a parent and a protractor
but can you have chocolate milk ?
wtf was the point of this.
So excited there's finally a Selfridge-Conway video on YouTube! I was thinking about making one myself, haha.\nThe first discrete and finite four-person procedure was just discovered last year (Aziz-Mackenzie), which requires 203 steps and 584 cuts! They don't know if it is optimal, though.
whats with the drawings
Cute.
That cake looks so gross
or just make 120° angles
cut it into 6, lul
Whats so unfathomable about thirds?
Cut into 6 pieces . Done!
Who gets all those crumbs?
stop pushing your commie propaganda on me youtube
Piece of cake
Eat everything, run fast
Disappointing
herez the way to PERFECTLY cut it in 3 parts.......\na circle is 360*\n\nso dividing them equally would mean dividing them in 120* 120* and 120* angles\n\nso u cut the radius RS with the center a point R the knife...keep a protracter and draw a radius RQ such that angle QRS would be 120* same repeat it again, and u get a cake divided equally by three people...the only issue with this is that this can only be divided amongst a number of people which is a factor of 360
Alice, bob and Charlie huh, Charlie... yeah right.
person 1. cuts three pieces\nperson 2. pick top two pieces and trims one to make two equal pieces (trim is added to other piece - not separated)\nperson 3. 1st pick\nperson 2. 2nd pick\nperson 1. 3rd pick.
The smallest piece is for the dog, duh. 🙄
Or just get out your protractor
Why don't you just slice a cake by 4 pieces and slice one of them in 3 which is easier than slicing the whole cake?
What's wrong with cutting the cake as for four and then halving the remaining quater? Or cutting it into sixths?
Can't you just split it in 6 and give each 2 pieces
Just cut the cake into sixtfhs and have two slices each? XD
they can easily bluff about being equally sarisfied with each piece
and this is why socialism doesn't work
Ben sounds so soft, almost soothing haha you guys are totally made for each other :)
Ben is a good husband 👍🏻👍🏻
Ben is such an amazing husband, you really were blessed with him, Jenn! God bless y'all!! :)
So beautiful♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
So beautiful loveeee this!!
You guys are such a beautiful family. Aria is gorgeous. Can't wait to see her grow :)\nAnd I love 냉면 ㅋㅋㅋ
❤️
Cutest babyyyy evaaaa
Who disliked this!!!????
Jen, this is one of my favorite videos! So glad that Ben was able to share his side of experience. Thank you two for being so honest. And you two are so cute together.
My favorite video on YouTube.
Gee whiz Aria nails the look into the camera thing lol It was so intense, it felt like she was looking deep into my soul that I had to look elsewhere. Love this father's side of the story, it definitely is one we don't hear often enough! Thank you for sharing!!
Awe! I cried watching both of you guys worked together and comfort each other. I also can't wait for the future. 😊
so  much warmth and love shown in this video....i love it...
Just Beautiful, thank you!
Such a gorgeous video!
Beautiful video. Wow.
Aww little Oreo snoozing in the background!
Cuties baby girl 💕
You look perfect together :D
BEAUTIFUL!!!
i love you both sooo sooo sooo mutch!!!!! <333
❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
I'm not a mother and will probably not give birth to a child, but I totally love this series. Thanks for being open and honest about your experiences. Your story is thoughtful and inspiring. I wish you and your family all the best.
Awww, this was honestly the sweetest and most real video I've seen in such a long time!! You guys are such a beautiful family :) Hope you're all recovered now Jen! I can't imagine what you had to go through! Best of luck with everything :) <3
You two are husband and wife goals. The definition of soul mates. \n\nI loved hearing Ben's take on fatherhood, because it's the side we don't usually focus on. I teared up when he talked about holding her for the first time. \n\nYour love for each other and Aria is so beautiful. May you continue to be blessed in love ❤️❤️
I gave birth about 8 months ago and watching this made me reminisce my entire pregnancy and I couldn't help but cry. Ben was so understanding and considerate about everything. It was nice to hear the fathers side of the story.
Congratulations!  I felt great after watching three of you guys.  Wishing you all the best of best in your every step of new life.
I don't often say this but... you two are totally couple goals! What a beautiful relationship. And Aria is so cute!
I can't get over how much Aria has grown. Like, time just seems to fly and every time she's featured in a video. I'm just blown away. \n\nThank you for these type of videos btw....tbh I have tokophobia so pregnancy and the prospects of getting pregnant scare the living daylights out of me but I recognize that in itself, it's quite beautiful and it's such a joy to see the child after the birth and watching it grow. My 3 year old cousins has basically been living with my family since her birth and I'm in awe of how she's growing. Much like Ben said, it's so fun to take a kid somewhere and see them seeing something for the first time.\n\n\n Also, tbh.. I've got a little anxiety when it comes to relationships too ...When it comes to the men in my life, I haven't really had a good example as what it means to be a good husband but Ben gives me hope. It's very easy for me to forget that there are guys out there who are such decent fellows. So, thank you for that as well.
You made so many great points about how new dads can struggle too. I don't have kids but if my husband and I ever do I will be sure to remember this video and thank him for all the sacrifices he is making. Thank you Jen and Ben for sharing such a personal story with all of us. You guys are incredibly brave and inspiring.
This is the sweetest thing ever! I love hearing the two of you talk and how calm and sweet you both are. And oh my goooooodness Aria is adorable! You should invite Ben in more videos in the future. :)
ben is such a sweetheart, you guys are a perfect pair and family!
One of the best vlogs of Jen :) God bless your little family!!
You guys are beautiful! thanks for sharing a real story. I was tearing up hearing how Ben was anxious about what was happening to Jen. my husband and I are definitely the same type of couple, but we don't have kids yet. I think I am not ready for our lives to change. Thanks for sharing your story and congratulations on beautiful Aria!
Man - this girl must've had the world's most difficult pregnancy. I always felt bad for my husband because he didn't get to experience the amazing miracle of having his child grow inside of him and all the special moments that come with that. \n\nIt wasn't always comfortable but it was special and something only half the world's population is capable of. \n\nAlso - you can go to the movies when you are pregnant haha 😜
Thank you for being so honest ,because a lot of women are a shame to say what really happens and one one person is honest then a makes way for other women to feel okay to be honest 😊
do more videos of aria please! shes so cute
This is my favorite video of yours so far
Thank you Ben for sharing your side and your experience!
this made my heart feel soooo warm and hopeful! what a beautiful couple inside and out, pure love for y'all
U guys r so cute and so supportive
It's funny that my 2 favourite beauty YouTubers are named Jen (Jenn Im) and coincidentally their husband/fiancé are both named Ben 🙂😮❤️🇨🇦
Such a beautiful family:)
I remember when ben would never be in front of the camera 😅
Thank you so, so much for making this precious video! My son is about to turn 8 months, and your video helped bring back a lot of memories along with a big reminder to remember and appreciate my husband's struggle as well. Thanks again!!
You are a beautifully loving family. How lucky you are to have each other and how blessed your little one is to have such devoted parents.
WOW this was amazing to watch. I'm nowhere near a baby but I love watching your pregnancy videos
As soon as Aria came into shot I could hardly focus on anything else Jen and Ben were saying. She's too cute. xx
So great idea to also share the dad story ❤️❤️❤️😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️ God bless your fam! 😭
This is so sweet!! Thank you for posting this video and sharing both sides of your experiences with pregnancy, birth, and life after baby. :D Congratulations on your family and I hope you all have a blessed life! Sending love and hugs!
Every single time we see Aria, she just looks so happy! It must be because she knows she has the most loving, positive parents ever! What a beautiful family! Seriously Aria is the CUTEST HAPPIEST baby I've ever seen!
she's such a lovely creature
I've always loved seeing Ben on his Snapchat stories while he was playing with little Aria! Also how incredibly she resembles him :) \nI've loved momtember. It's a pleasure seeing your videos!
Thank you for sharing your beautiful story. I love that you mentioned how the sacrifices increased your love for each other. I have a nine month old daughter and we can totally relate to you both!! So comforting to share the struggles. It's so worth the hardship to be a parent!
Oh that's the best video! I was in tears! We just had our first baby daughter 3 month ago. It was so great to see dads prospective even though we discussed it with my husband!! Thank you very much for that! Brilliant video!!
This is such a great video. Thank you both for being so honest and vulnerable about an intense time in your lives. It is so greatly appreciated. You two are fantastic parents!
i loooove this video so much, thanks guys- youre going to be great parents :) Jen, can you make a video about things you would and wouldn't to for your next pregnancy that you did for your time with Aria? In terms of mentally (i.e relaxation, prayers etc), physically (i.e practice breathing, exersize, massages etc) and so forth? :D
I wish my husband was like Ben.. When I had my first baby, he wasn't all the time with me, I had to be strong for my baby. I didn't sleep at all, I felt sad all the time, i cried alone.. He was more interested in his cars then us :'( \nNow my baby is two years old, and I have a 4 month old, but he is almost the same. But now he's priority is sex, he is always thinking in sex! :( I don't know what to do.. I'm sorry to tell my life here, i feel like expressing my self, to get out all my stress..  Jen and Ben, I wish you the best!! God bless you guys!
She has ben’s hair lol. This video makes me jealous that you guys have such a wonderful healthy relationship and family. Thank you for sharing your journey.
Can echo what you guys mentioned.  I had a hard pregnancy myself, but because it was so hard, I loved my baby and my husband so much more.  Thanks so much for sharing!  It's so important for the husband to also express his emotions and all too!!!
It is so cute that Aria seems to give response to Jen & Ben's conversion! She seems to understand what you two meant !
So honest, I love it!
!!! love love love this video Jen! my boyfriend and i also have this clingy but very strong relationship and I cannot wait to show him this video when the time comes(couple years from now lol) i feel like this video is so honest and helpful and I am so grateful you decided to film this! i wish your family the best :)
Thankyou for sharing you story. I love this momtember series ❤️❤️❤️
Most beautiful video! You are amazing parents, Aria is so precious! Gob bless you!!!
Wow!! so great to see the both of you
Such a beautiful family!!! 😭❤
I cried so much 😭 you guys are so sweet
You made me feel better. :)
Such a beautiful story!!! You guys are amazing parents!!!!
such an emotional video. I think we all cried :') \nit's so cute that Aria already knows how to always smile to the camera in this video
She's seriously the cutest baby I've seen
Ah, it's so hard! And we are about to do this again...
This was so so emotional to watch Ive never even had a baby but it made me feel so many emotions.  This was super insightful and beautiful to listen to!
You are so, so blessed, Jen 😭❤
Jen and Ben, you guys have a wonderful and beautiful family ❤
This is so beautiful! Y'all remind me of me and my husband, May God bless you and your family!
Beautiful, Just so beautiful :) Have 21 month old and 5 months pregnant :) New journey has begun ❤️❤️
Moms, you guys are ridiculous -Ben 😩 it's one of the Best Compliments any mom could ever get. Thank you Ben for recognizing how ridiculously hard being a mom is. God bless your beautiful family!Aria is one blessed baby to have you two and soooo cute & adorable
You're such a beautiful family 💖💖💖 and Ben is such an amazing father. Hope my future husband will also be so supportive and nice! :P And you can totally see how you're so in love with each other!\nThank you so much for sharing!!
What a wonderful husband you have. You can tell how much love and respect you both have for each other. I wish more men were like Ben, the world would benefit.
my throat was really tight the whole time watching this video :')
What an adorable family! Thank you Ben and Jen for sharing your story.  Aria is so precious!!!
Where can I get myself one of these bens
I love this series!!keep it coming please.
Did not expect to cry this much watching this video, but it is really awesome to also hearing the father's side of everything, which is definitely not talked about as much. Thank you for doing this. This makes me look forward to having a family in the future.
This is one of my favorite video.  So touched and cried too :(  I am definitely going to ask my husband to watch this video when we will be pregnant.. ❤️
So nice to hear from Ben,  he should be in videos more 💁🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️🙋🏼‍♂️
Such a sweet couple. Congratulations!
Awwww seeing little Aria was so cute! Thank you Jen & Ben for sharing your story! I think I cried like a baby 😭 so sweet how you both recognized each other's sacrifices and love each other even more than you thought before!💕
Such a wonderful family you have. 😍😍😍😍😍😍
The way Aria admires her papa 19:48 is SO precious!! <3
This made me tear up a little. I appreciate your honesty telling your story 💓
Oh gosh I cried. I love you guys so much! Great job Ben!! ❤️
I had a very easy recovery after the birth body wise, but I had PPD and with the changes going on when my baby was born..I hated her newborn phase. I enjoyed her, I love her dearly, caring for her was wonderful, but at the same time I was depressed and I hated my life at times. So many things changed and it traumatized me. My furbabies are gone and I became THAT parent who had to rehome them for their benefit. My husband and I vented to each other, and we got closer,  but we also fought. My two month maternity leave was hell, and she came six weeks early so I was not fully prepared. I can't imagine life without her, and she is now almost 11 months, but I am so traumatized I blocked out those few months. It's not all rainbows when a baby comes into the world, so thank you for being honest with these videos to show people the truth.
After Aria entered the screen, she was all my eyes stated at hahaha. Sorry Jen and Ben, I ignored you both for the last part of the video 😌 She looks like a little elf with those pointy ears, so adorable!!
Ben is such a sweet considerate husband😭😍 Its so true! you always hear the moms side of the story but truthfully its hard for both side. Im currently pregnant with my 2nd child and this time around i could feel how heavy my husband's shoulders are trying to take of the family in every aspects. Big thumbs up to dads out there too! They got alot of responsibility too! I also heard dads can grt post-partum depression too. love your  mommyhood videos!! ♥️
Its nice to hear the father's side, you don't get to hear it often. For those of us who were first time moms and had to learn alone about newborn babies and Google was your only back up lol well I understand you but believe when I tell you that you'll appreciate your baby so much more because you were both getting to know each other.   I can only say from personal experience, in those times of frustration and tiredness I held on to God and he helped me through it all. Now my baby is almost 4 months and I'm so excited to see what the future has instore for us. The key to being a good mother and a good partner is patience and wisdom and above all be open to suggestions from people who have been through it.
HE IS SO PERFECT WTF DONT LEAVE HIM EVER
Hey Estee, I’m a 27 YO guy (probably not your usual demographic) and I randomly discovered one of your vlogs maybe 5 years ago during a break up. It was a rough patch for me, it really sucked. Your videos helped and they were a great distraction. When the pain of the break up finally passed, the love of your videos remained! You, Aslan and Reggie became a part of my morning routine. I feel like I’ve seen you and your channels grow, and I’ve grown up with you too. I’ve travelled so much the last few years and I think your travelling videos are to thank for it, keeping me motivated to see as much of the world as I can. I even introduced my new girlfriend to your videos and we watch them together as often as you upload haha! I’ve just listened to your first podcast and I love this new direction. I wish you all the best and good luck. Anyway, just wanted to pass on some love!
It is great to understand what happens in the background & who is working (which roles) in order to get a podcast. Thanks!
I was smiling so hard watching this!! So nice to see how it's like behind the scenes :D wishing you lots of success! Excited for the Mum episode!
sooo proud of you estee!!! can't wait to see you grow even more!
Hey Estee, I love your podcasts and your more serious side! Don't get me wrong, makeup and beauty are awesome but it's great to know there's so much more to you. And the podcasts are really well produced as well (shoutout to the team), I SO look forward to hearing more! Subscribed already, keep it up!
YES GIRL! x
So awesome! you look so happy!
No! You weren't lucky to win! You won because you were the best. Girls! Don't be afraid of your own success!
The recording room definitely makes a difference!! Totally heard the quality change once you walked into the room and at the outro. I’ve never been a big podcast listener but I listen to a lot of NPR so I feel like I’m properly prepped to delve into yours! 💕
Love it!! 💕
Hi Estée this is great!!!!! Also I'm drunk and I love yooooooUUU
what a gang! incredible team and job! cant wait to listen to it all! xx
Thank you for using your platform in a meaningful way, Estee! It's been incredible to watch you evolve from makeup tutorial and clothing haul videos to this beautiful podcast!  Although I still love your beauty/style content, I LOVE the political/social videos you do witih Aslan, as well as this podcast!  Congrats!!
Very nice program ❤️
Girl power. Love it!
Absolutely love your podcast, so great that you have an all-women team, the quality is top notch!
Your collar was misbehaving. That sounds cute! It bothers me a lot when I get pictures taken and later I see the collar was all messed up! :D

So nice to see how your content and confidence has grown with your channel/career, I find myself unsubbing from a lot of youtubers I watched say 5/6 years ago as I feel like the content just hasn't progressed and i'm not interested in the same things I was when I was 18/19. Glad that I'm still loving your stuff though estee keep doin what you're doin x

It's very exciting to see how you and your content are evolving. I've been watching you and other lifestyle YouTubers for years and honestly, these days, my subscription list is looking stale/repetitive (not another PR unboxing!).

What in the name of fuck did I accidentally click ?! 🤢
No uploads in a year and then you drop this gem.
Do you hate scousers.. erm... haha I love the hesitation.
that moment when you leave Gary Neville hanging
Nice interview. Gracious of him to take the time.
Lifelong Liverpool fan and have always liked Gary Neville ... he hated us and we hated him ...a born winner he was a top quality player and very solid guy
I like Gary but he's wrong about Suarez, if United ever signed suarez it'd be a disgrace to the legend of Uncle Pat.
Can not believe neville has actually just said he would love suarez at united might be a really good player but after what he did to evra i would never want him anywhere near man united
Lol how'd you manage this, nice one.
The intro made me skip to another video.
Great interview, Gary could talk the hind legs off a donkey, awesome fella.
Football punditry has taken a huge leap towards the Simon Cowell end of criticism. It's immediate and tabloid but it works. Most pundits have taken on a contrived media persona now and are almost certainly delighted to be the talking point in the days after a game. Not saying that's a negative thing, I just find it interesting to see this generation of ex-pros going into a television studio and not continuing their careers through management. They suffer from the same ego issues we all do.
This guy fufilled every manc kids dream. \nFair play to him, always stayed humble and loyal. Respect
Love listening to him
Well done Gary - always talking sense as usual
Best football pundit at the moment
The hairdryer question...I swear I could see Gary's fear coming back onto his face.
Confused when seeing the thumbnail; thought it was prankster EdBassmaster pulling one of those funny faces.
lFC  you'll never win the league  ha ha ha come back when youve  won 18 ha
Amazing work. Been awhile since you uploaded anything, that was definitely worth waiting for! Happy to have one video a year if that video ends up being a sit down with a United legend.
Yip, Jose has never hung around that long at clubs. \nBut he's never been manager at a club like this and all that we encompass ❤️
Thank fuck you're back. Also quality interview.
1 minute long intro
Vid starts at 1:02
Legend
Really enjoyed this, cheers.
Great Interview!
Cranium Giganticus
Absolutely
Great interview
Brilliant vid
Gaz.. get the guitar
amazing interview
Gary being interviewed by the British Seth Rogan!!!
Peroni   lovely  lager
city winnin the CL is a bigger deal than LFC winnin the PL. im a man utd fan by the way
I don't hate scousers now says Gary and cue selena's bad liar playing in the background 🤣🤣
Manchester is being destroyed by savage immigration.
Man Utd have always appointed british managers? Tell that to Frank O'Farrell Gary. Man Utd have traditionally had non-English managers, because, in the football world, there is no 'british'.
I am a Everton fan and a Scouser Gary would have been a great central defender he was to short though but Rio was quality .
Gary Neville is a true United legend, bless him!
Intro song??
that table though
Quality interview
Don't want Suarez. Thanks.
Corona is Mexican Mr Neville ;-)
I'm not even into 5h or Camila Cabello, but I liked this song and searched for a live performance of this and now I'm like ... SHOOK 0_0  She's so confident!!! Her stage presence is awesome and what a good voice!!! Now I'm going to listen to her full album haha
She is a total star
Why she is so PRETTY!?
Urghhh she's just so perfecttt
I Freaking LOVE CAMILA & BLACKPINK !!!! They Slay !!!!!! =)
Her leaving 'that' girl group is the greatest thing evvah
I love how the trumpeter dancing😍😍
I love her so much. She's so damn beautiful
ok but i cannot get over her live voice. i was listening to this in another tab and thought for sure that it was the official recording ...
I could feel her performance
Great video,  thanks for uploading.  Excellent performance by Camila,  the dancers and the trumpet player.  Love Camila,  can't wait for her album to eventually come out
She's a true star.
SHOOK\nSHOOK\nSHOOK\nSHOOK\nSHOOK\nSHOOK
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I'm the only one who love her voice?
Camila Cabello: Best New Artist on Grammys 2018 :) :) :)
I love this song so much!!!
This live performance deserves a studio version. It's soooo damn good!
Let me tell y'all a story. THIS SONG IS ON FIRE!!! The end.
Girrrrrl I love this performance!! You lit!
over here, she reminded me of a sexy French singer, Alizee (,)
Why the people who can sing are not that famous
Wow that’s kept my attention
Red looks bomb on her💕
😍She said that the official HAVANA VIDEO WILL NOT BE LIKE THIS PRESENTATION. \nI don't know what to expect, but I'm sure it'll be good.🎶
Man, she has got SOME voice! And what an awesome stage presence. Lol you can tell she's just owning the place and havin a blast. All that put together with the trumpet and his sick licks? Now THIS is music! Just awesome. Bravo!
I love this song ❤
I don't want to say that I like her, but I can't deny she's doing such a good job and maybe it's right for her to leave those girls.
Trumpeter is serious about out slaying Camilla!!!\nI'm living
Half of my heart is with Camila🎶 😍
just thought... imagine if this was a fifth harmony, with 5 girls singing this song it would sound too sexual kind of like every other fifth harmony song they have made.... hmmm.. guess with only 1person it doesnt sound as sexual lol.
Can we just notice the trumpeter????
just did a cover of this check it out (; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDa3H5zjwJY&t=6s

https://youtu.be/09VJW8M_TIc let’s get Camilas song some views
I love her so much 💗💗😩
I don't really like the outfit she is wearing but I love her music it is sooooooooo good
The trumpet player gives me life

Can anyone tell me why james hasn't released the other maze runner book   ahh forgot what it was called

Still waiting for kill order
Ownership distant universe killer twenty fiction shore medium range.

God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v67V3KtaSno

TFW a song on Rock Band adds an extra chord/drum fill at the end of a song that originally faded out and you miss.
HAHAHHAHAHA my god. That was perfect. Again, the ending is always what makes me burst out laughing.

How is this trending
it's 106 miles to Chicago, we've got a full tank of gas, a half pack of cigarettes, it's dark and we're wearing sunglasses.\nHit it!\n\n74' Dodge Monaco with a 440!
I hate semi's. Especially when the car you drive is small in comparison. People who take on semi's on the free way are stupid.
We all know the Top Gear car chase was the best ever
Too bad Smokey And The Bandit was a 70's movie.
Remember Commando? Arnold crashes stolen Sunbeam into a light pole with this chick a s a passenger NO SEAT BELTS. You ok 😅 \nAnd the Porsche got wrecked too. Good ol 80s man
Yall should make a list consisting of nothing but 80's TV shows! Dukes of Hazzard. Knight Rider. The A-Team. Miami Vice.
Armed and Dangerous 1986 had a pretty gnarly semi vs. corvette chase. Needles to say, Maximum Overdrive has a great one as well. Lisa Simpson almost gets wrecked.
I love this! with real chases not like today in the fast and Furious thing
NO ONE does a car chase scene quite like good old USA!
Great choices. Now do the 70s: Bullitt, The driver...
Play the game Driver San Francisco. There is 4 or 5 car chase sequences right out of some of the best car chase movies. Its fantastic.
kick ass list. you should use a soundbooth next time tho. the echo of your voice is annoying.
Loved it
Oh, you started narrating your videos! Good for you!
It came out in May of 1990 so it fell just shy of an 80's movie but I've have always LOVED this car chase from the movie Short Time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWRrSufx5kw
On this episode of watch mojo...
That chase from Cobra is, easily, the most absurd car chase I've ever seen in a theater.  I mean, really.  Here's Stallone, in a wildly modded and totally sweet custom Mercury...with nitrous injection, a stonking motor, the whole shebang.  He can't catch a stock Dodge Aspen.  I mean, those guys are driving what you'd pick up at Alamo as a rental in 1985.  They outrun him.  I remember howling at the screen, as Stallone flails.   He struggles to keep up.  And then he crashes.  They escape.  In their Dodge Aspen. That's the chase.  Some action hero.  Cobra?  Hah.  More like...um...Slow-bra.
I think you should've added Dirty Harry - The Dead Pool.  Awesome car chase with a remote control car that has a bomb in the streets of SF
The Blues Brothers, number 4?!?!?! Come on....
No Man's Land (1987) - Charlie Sheen and DB Sweeney are car thieves, more specifically Porsche thieves. The chase scene with the 911 Turbo and the rival car thieves is epic.
If you like old truck movies I suggest Maximum Overdrive or even better Duel
The Semi Truck thing?\n\nIt's not just a phobia, there are some serious physics involved with that kind of mass! \ncare must be taken driving around them! <3 all
now do top 10 from the 90s and 00s!
2:33 “favouritist ” isn’t a word
KNIGHT RIDER - like every episode with turbo boooooost?!
Good entries on the list. I got some others for you to check out. Take a look at the last Steve McQueen movie The Hunter. There is some good car stunts in there. Even a chase with farm equipment chasing a Trans Am. Also, even though the movies are not as liked as the first. Smokey and the Bandit part 2 and even 3 were 80s flicks with good car scenes.
Nice to see the Junkman getting some love!
That first clip features a Ferrari 308 GTS not 308 GT (no such thing). GTS in Ferrari terms refers to the Targa Top
The 80's must have been fucking epic
Lets see if you bastards can do 90
You also missed Smokey and the Bandit
My boss worked on the opening chase of mad Max 1
Ronin has an awesome car chase, I think that's 90s though?
Donut Media can you make a list of the top 10 American supercars?\nthank you
You should do one for the 1990s 2000s 1970s and 1960s!
The Blues Brothers\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue's Clues
I was hoping to see Blues Brothers. This video did not disappoint.
I know how you feel with the semi truck thing. I'm not afraid of them personally but my girlfriend is TERRIFIED. Even when she's not in the car I still have to floor it past them out of havit
Great video! Mine has always been the chase in Cobra. I remember seeing it when I was about 10 and it was the greatest thing in the world! That Mercury is so bad ass!
Duel, it was made in 71 so I see it not making the list.  As far as car chase by sketchy semi, that's the whole movie.
great car scene from the movie Ronin!
Make a video on the S2000
A dumb little fact, but the Santa Fe Diesel engine at 5:28 is actually still in service for the Big Trees and Pacific. And you can still see the Santa Fe livery  if you look hard enough. It also wears the same no. 2600 as it did in the film.
YOU CALLED THE MONACO A JALOPY? BLASPHEMY!!!!!
Smokey and the bandit but thats not 80s
so glad mad max made it on here
Future hall of famer... The opening scene in Baby Driver.
very good countdown. on the other hand, the echo is distracting, you guys should really record the voiceover in a soundproof room.
Why not a Greatest car chase scenes of all time?
I'd be curious to see your list of the best chases from each decade. This formula works well since it's too hard to make a top 10 of all time list without EVERYONE's list being practically the same group of the most famous chases. They end up overlooking the lesser-known gems like some of the films in this video.
*Every battle from Initial-D with eurobeat intensifies*
Mad Max 2 is in my opinion the ultimate car guy movie, and also my favorite movie ever made.
4:35 Does he honestly think they were actually going over 100.
The whole time, I was thinking of Baby Driver...
What about the Chase from the opening scene of The Incredibles... I mean... it probably took place in the 80s...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJk .... it was probably the 90s
I think Beyond Thunderdome should have been included.  Cars, motorcycles, planes, a train, and a fucking hand cart.
Beverly Hills Cop. Hands fucking down... or the Blues Brothers. Anyone else is just a pussy
You guys should do Top 10 car chases from the 70's next and Smokey and the Bandit better be in there lol.
My favorite car chase from 1980's \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TF8z7h1lhQ
Glad to see 007 represented, but the car chase from For Your Eyes Only (with a Citreon 2CV) was also worthy of inclusion.
Are we going to get one for the 70s?
Lol for real tho I stay as far as possible from semi-trucks. I either stay 5 car lengths behind them, get over to the opposite end of them or try to get in ahead of them. Idc if I miss my exit I'm staying away from them because of movies like the ones mentioned. Also Great video.
your mic has an echo or the room your in
Don't have a phobia of semi trucks per say, but I do have reoccurring dreams of getting t-boned by one while going through an intersection.
I came here basically to see The Blues Brothers on the list.\nI ended up with a couple another movies I should watch :P \nThanks! :D
1970's Gone in 60 Seconds. (1974). Eleanor
The original gone in 60 seconds is the best
Where's Smokey and the bandit 2 with old Buford and his posse of Gaylord and Reggie in the desert... Classic !!
What about the car chase in the james bond movie For your eyes only?
Good collections.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evA3_NV7cPM

Please Up to speed: Subaru WRX
rápido y furioso no es nada .. ala par de estas películas
god your stupid you missed the top chasses Bullitt, Gone in 60 seconds are 2 of the top car chasses.
Gone in 60 seconds!!!
Gone in 60 seconds.........i know its not from 80's but come on
Hers 3 moves for you : Smoky and the bandit. Gone in 60 sec. Vanishing point. 😊🖒
I would have included CONVOY, and Steven Spielbergs DUEL, i mean cone on both of these films are basically a huge semi-truck chase
Anyone else see that lifted subaru wagon at the beginning?
You guys forgot about Smokey and the bandit
Oh thank god! Every body we're saved! Dan Bilzahrjdbesn is going to get his gun. What a cock sucker
I doubt he saw anything. He just wants attention.
Why the fuck is this #2 on trending. Actually why.
Muricans need to understand they need to stop selling guns. Check how many people die to guns everyday in america compared to another place which doesnt sell weapons.
When it's dark skinned people doing the shooting, the tin foilers believe it and call it terrorism\nWhen it's a white guy, the paranoid pricks scream *FAKE*\nGoes to show what a bunch of racist cunts they are
I'm pretty sure Dan Blitzerian is lying about seeing the girl next to him get shot in the face and seeing her brains hanging out.
WHITE TERRORIST
Say it with me...\nWHITE TERRORIST ...\nincoming Alex Jones rednecks with the hoax and false flag
Such a shame innocent people have to die due to selfish evil people in this world. I really have no idea why guns are allowed in the USA it's actually stupid
What a cunt.
I love how this guy hears a gun and thinks  this will be a great insta story
Big man on insta.  Pussyole in real life. Going back to get ur gun? Stfu u bailed like a bitch and couldn’t give a fuck about the dying. Prick
If you monkeys can open your eyes, you can see that this was on the news and 50 people died. He was recording this to show you what was going on as he was escaping. While everyone in the crowd were being brutally murdered as shots rained down on them.\n\nThe only thing That I'm hoping  for is that everyone can find there family's and can still be alive. \nAnd no It wasn't a Muslim who did the shooting.
Why is this on trending who even is this guy?
Wish this cunt would have copped for it. So many innocent people needlessly losing their lives and we have this cock smoker running away filming it for his Instagram. CUNT
Sound like toy guns and he aint running for shit
First white people shooting at schools now music festivals. What's next??🤔
we have guns for self defense. 54 people die and 200 odd injured yet your guns did fuck all to help. Get with the fucking times.
@17 seconds there was 2 guns being fired
It says even more about society that this is #1 trending.
We meet at last LIAR!!
I'm going to get my gun to solve this. Yeah like that isn't the whole problem encapsulated in one sentence.
It doesnt even look like as if hes trying to run
The least meaningful organism on planet earth.
WHAT A COCKSUCKER MON TILL BELFAST I'LL FIGHT YOU
This guy looks like bill williamson from rdr
When will America wake up and realise the second amendment needs to go the same way as slavery! Get with the times people!
Highly disrespectful. Both Dan and the one who uploaded this to promote his attention seeking is a twat.
If there was actually a girl that got shot in the head next to him, poor gal. Next time pick your targets, shooter, could've actually been helpful.
So glad you had all those guns mate. Really helped
He seems pretty chilled out considering he just witnessed a girl get shot in the head. He was just casually sprinting to get his gun like no problem -.- I
Fair play to guy, even if it was for abit of publicity hes actually went back to genuinely help others which is more than most of you keyboars warriors would do in the comments.
Every other recording is of the crowds and chaos. Narcissist records himself and how he is going to save the day.
Whoopty fucking doo cunt, someone got shot in the head, let me just post an insta story. Rat
TBH I think in America you should be allowed pistols and revolvers but nothing else, I would rather they didn't have any guns but the sad truth is they need it their is a lot of people in America and even if you take their guns away there still will be a lot of crime probably just knife crime, so I think you should be allowed handguns but nothing else only for protection.
It's sad that it's this guys first instinct to whip out his phone and record for instagram, that would be the last thing on my mind
Is it me or does he only start running when he notices the video has begun?
What a cunty way to talk about a girl dying, if it’s real at all.
Dan has the most insane life
Lucky his chicken legs didn’t cripple from that running
Good thing all those people had guns to protect themselves.
This guy is a fucking retard
Fucking idiots thinking this is fake, how the fuck would you get away with a hoax like this? there is hundreds upon hundreds of witnesses, if it was fake we would know by now.
Oh look let me just grab my phone and record the whole thing to my Instagram story while a fucking maniac with an arsenal of guns is firing off at hundreds of people in an open area. WOW! I just saw a girl get her brains blown out, let me grab my trusty gun to let everyone know I'm ready to shoot anyone who comes at me and add to the casualty count even more! This will definitely gain me some followers! Why? CAUSE AMERICA!!
It seems everyone wants to be a hero in America.
3000 people killed in 911 = 60 shooting of this scale so yeah fuck off muslims
I fucking hate how ignorant americans are, even after a shooting like this they refuse to accept that their bullshit gun laws are not to blame. The whole thing about defending thier second ammendment is also complete fucking bullshit, nobody cares about laws that where established hundreds of years ago, these are different times that require different laws so dont give me any of that shit. Here in scotland it took one shooting for our government to apply major changes to gun laws and now look at the differences in shooting statistics between the UK and the US. If you cant see this then you need help or atleast a basic education.
And thus was born the biggest crutch for liberals to stand on when it comes to discussing terrorism for the next 50 years.
They might as well have guns as toys in kinder eggs in America, im surprised more people are shot each day for no reason.
for those white people who keep claiming that ISIS behind this, go suck your dick with your brain stupid ass. \nThis stupid ISIS keep claiming everything to destroy ISLAM, so STFU
LMAO at people downvoting this video. I see a lot of people thought this video was fake in the comments and now they probably feel fucking stupid knowing it wasn't fake. He just wants attention He probably didn't see a girl get headshotted give me a break. He's not the one that posted this to youtube. He posted it to his own instragram feed. And considering 50 people died it's likely he saw someone around him get headshotted. Sheesh...
This world is so fucked
Why did I have to use google to find out who the shooter was, if it was a Muslim you'll have his photograph, his name, his social security number, his dob, his entire bloody biography presented for you on television
This did is a crisis actor DoucheBag. Fuck his punk ass
Check Out He's Insta Profile Pic 😈
Bet he was never there
Sad he didn't get killed
“Stupid ass me didn’t bring a gun”\n\nYeah because that would’ve done FUCK ALL to the guy with 10 rifles in his 35th floor hotel room. Idiot.
Can somebody please get Ja Rule on the phone to confirm this
The guys a prick and gets famous for women and weapons. Mad the world we live in now.
Some stupid assholes on this feed, go to the box and switch on the news you dolts.
I dont think Dan Bilzarian is a crisis actor. I followed him for a while because he is good friends with John Dolmayan of System of a down and he is a super rich asshole which him and his bro made a killing (no pun) playing poker. I quit following him because hes a super douche and just flaunts his shit. But crisis actor no. He does like the camera tho, he is Armenian lol\n\nAlthough i am going to keep an eye on this, it is suspicious how they keep getting info wrong and videos look contrived....
A White Christian Terrorist with links to the KKK and a Donald Trump Supporter??? 🤔
HURR DURR GUNS FOR PROTECTION HURR DURR
Political agenda comment # 101093838200237749330484774202
This is puke
Stupid shooter missed Dan....FUCK!
white power!
Who?
Fake bullshit!
Shame this cunt didn't get shot
SIN CITY
Staged....
Usa is always on a war footing because the general public have guns, in Australia we are outraged but domestic abuse deaths and random punch ups that end up with a death.
Oh boy, we’re all fucking saved because this fucking idiot went back and got a gun. Whoop-De-fucking-do! Do you not realise that American people just being able to *grab a gun during a mass shooting and go back* or more widely be able to *obtain guns easily* is why this shit happens. Gun culture is fucked, America is fucked and there really isn’t a point in trying anymore. Americans never learn from their mistakes (I speak of those who still defend the right to bear arms not all Americans. It’s just their retarded voices sound louder than the rest)\n\nEdit: all those who would say he has the right to carry a fire arm for protection is retarded. HE SHOULDN’T NEED TO CARRY A FIRE ARM FOR PROTECTION IN THE FIRST PLACE! If you made gun control tighter, I’m sure that maybe events like Columbine and school shootings would decrease, because kids couldn’t get their dads rifle and fuck up their neighbourhood. There is no way around it; American gun control is fucked and the fact that people are calling for *stricter* gun control is the most retarded thing I’ve heard because THERE IS NO FUCKING GUN CONTROL, AND IF THERE IS THEN IT DOESN’T FUCKING WORK. HOW CAN YOU MAKE SOMETHING THAT DOESN’T EXIST STRICTER? WHY DON’T YOU IMPLEMENT IT FIRST?
What a horrible fucking person
actors? u guys are sad faggots
Biggest shooting in US history!
I LOVE Americans thinking guns are a good idea. Fucking stupidest country on the planet. And everyone thinks it, except them.
For those of you who dont know Dan was a trained marine so he isnt just some hill billy with a gun
The states really need to take action on their gun laws I mean take a look at the uk there has been 1 mass shooting in many decades and America has had over 200 in this year alone
This guy was easily bought....
Number of people killed in the US by muslims this year - 11 \n\nNumber of people killed in the US by nutjob Americans this year - 50+ \n\nYeah, nah. Continue to be scared of the muslims. I have no problem with you all dying at the hands of your own kind, because you were too busy being scared of the people what look a little different and stuff, but are statistically harmless to you. \n\nSource of the first figure comes from thereligionofpeace website, which has a very clear bias against Islam, so we can assume that their figures are, if not accurate, liberal. In this sense, liberal means 'higher number of instances than reality.'  Just saying, because I know how people shit the fucking bed when they see the word liberal.
Knowing white cuck liberals he probably did this just so people couldn't blame things on muslims anymore
I hope the pope get shot
I didn't come here for this I simply wanted to comment on the #1 trending video.
Guys were are the racist comments towards muslims oh wait who was the killer.
He was a christian terrorist
biggest hoax in hoax history
YOU ARE A FUCKING PUSSYYYY!!!! RAN LIKE A BITCH  \nYOUR FAKE ASS BULLSHIT DONT FOOL NOBODY MAAAAN!!!!
InThe thumb nail dan looks like a taliban member
Crazy..
The shooter was a leftist brainwashed by the media, who are always calling for white genocide.
why is this bullshit on trending. all the videos of this event on youtube and they put this idiot  on trending  why
Am actually surprised it wasn't a muslim this time.
Chauvinistic Cunt.
he saw a girl get shot in the head and didnt seem one bit shocked. I would freak out.
I guess anything trends these days.......
the mooselums want americans to experience what they have in syria...............but we only kill enemy combatants who are up to no good.   These people in vegas were civilians just trying to go to a concert., not hurting anybody.
lol can sum1 write what he says from 0:28. im not english .the slang is hilarious  xD
The best part is, Trump actually watches SNL, he's a NewYorker and the curiosity of what their saying about him eats him up. Although I don't think Baldwin is that great, the lines and over all sketch make it funny.
This is pretty much all SNL has going for it now.. and all the sad ass Hillary supporters sit here and eat up this puke ass comedy. Not all They’re stuffs bad. However  they over-played this skit like a fuck ton.
PIZZA GATE ! IT IS THE TRUTH, AND EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE CHILDREN BEING INJURED IN THE WORST WAY, THE FAKE MEDIA WHO PROTECTS HILLARY , WONT REPORT ON IT! HILLARY CLINTON, GEORGE SOROS RECEPTIONIST.
Only thing, SHS is not a fat woman. She's actually pretty hot.
It's amazing our country produces brain-dead audiences that watches this crap
If it was not for President Trump;   Mr. Baldwin , might not have a career......anymore.?
Hayley Geftman-Gold , another fucking piece of dog shit Liberal making a Hollywood grand statement   , now a jobless bitch just like Kathy Griffin  , hahahahahahaha \nGo Trump  , go Trump
Kate McKinnon is not funny, America needs to get off its boner and stop thinking people are talented just because they are good looking.
i was getting super mad watching them dumbass people burn their nfl jerseys on video but now i realize that's how trump supporters feel when they see this trending LMFAO .
I can't stand the sound of him breathing I almost couldn't get thru it but I know Trump is a goddamn mouth breather like that so good job on that impression baldwin
That Jeff Sessions impersonation is en pointe!
While in Las Vegas...
How do people find this funny? I would assume if you ended up on this show, you’d know you just hit rock bottom.
I can't help but love the impression. He has gotten better at it. Wasn't that good when it started
White people do everything for money they don’t care about anything don’t use tragedy to makes jokes I hate y’all
SNL is pure shit.  Has been since the early 90s.  No more steve martin, belushi, Chevy chase, Chris farley, etc........ The fact that they hired someone of the 90s (Nickelodeon program) Kenan and Kal speaks volumes.  The toilet has been flushed and the sound you are hearing while watching this is SNL circling the drain on their way into the terd tank
This is just excellent..even though it gives trumptard WAY to many smarts and reasoning power. Good to see Alec back though.
I love trump but this is hillarios the fat chick was the funniest haha

hes trash the other guy is better
this is so sad news http://newsplususa.com/las-vegas-shootout-multiple-weapons-found-in-terrorist-hotel-room/313
Fuck off snl like this show ain't even fucking funny anymore
I don't see how much of this is funny, a lot of this is mocking habit and also what he looks like, he can't help his funny looks or anything, but one thing that he's got better than any of us is that he's the gosh darn president and he is more successful than any of the democrats, or republicans watching this video.  He's not going to hurt America too bad, no matter what happens, in the end we will still be America and Americans have our freedoms and trump respects most if not all of our freedoms, and as president he can't really take our freedoms away anyways it has to go through the mostly democratic government. if he does wanna take a freedom of ours it'd be pretty hard for him. So I just can't see how he could hurt us bad enough to the point where we are so scared that so many people were crying that he won, more people than ever were threatening to move, even kindergarteners have started thinking they know everything about politics and they are scared too, most of the people who are scared, couldn't tell you much of a reason other than trumps bad or trump will hurt us \nAnd if you read to the bottom of this please don't start an argument below this, I don't wanna start any argument
Would just like to remind everyone... YouTube confessed to wanting to become TV AND that the trending tab is hand picked... (not based on numbers) Coincidence? I think not
You will wake up one day, thinking it was all a joke.. then you wake up the next, and start to realize we're messed up and broken. I believe Trump is our last hope, and while he has flaws, I support this wonderful man. Don't say things you heard only because a majority said it. You are being brainwashed by the social media to believe all these lies. Say what you want about a fantastic man, because I cannot change your mind. This is a real world, not some pathetic joke. Grow up.
This is so lame ...but funny how bad Hollywood and lame ass media wants Trump gone...
Why do you keep spreading hate! They had everything thing there! She needs to be smacked! My Puerto Rican friend they know the truth and they're talking
The quality of these president gags have dropped lot, I really liked them when they did the Putin ones ^.^ . I only laughed this time at the house speaker comment ( because that's so true :D)
I'm not a trump supporter,  I think he is not fit to lead,  but this just is not funny
Odd...it's almost like the same asshole who used cyber warfare to sway an election online...infested the comments section of one of his biggest, most seen detractors with similar tactics.  Post #fucktrump in the comments if you agree.
That’s a big bitch
If you keep making that face it's going to stay loke that.
and then there was bacon.
I have issues with SNL for many reasons, i literally couldn't give less of a fuck if you make fun of trump, just dont use it to push your liberal political agenda
I bet on SNL this Saturday they will have Alec playing Steve the Vegas shooter saying Allah Trump before murdering 50 people. SNL is so funny these days...
Every once and a while I watch these videos and it comforts me to know that a lot more people know this man is evil and stupid then think he's a good president
I've missed this
It's good to laugh and poke fun at things like this also There are very radical, sustainable solutions that have come to light over time. The Earthship, a radically sustainable way of living has emerged, and promises sustainable living without the need for giant electric corporations. It's beautiful to see other individuals so brilliantly walking the path of light, having fun and expressing. I wish all could further share ideas on a personal level. Although there shouldnt be, there are certain class and financial differences that keep myself and other individuals from the opportunity of collectively sharing with another at certain levels, that will make tremendous impact, potentially.

I wonder why they didn't show him talking to the GOVERNOR of Puerto Rico. It would have made more sense. Oh, that's right, the governor praised him.

They need to add more orange to Alec Baldwin to make him more Trumpesque....and orange is the only color that is numerically 33...the Free Mason run this world!
This is just a terrible impression. Don't know how people find this funny. I didn't laugh once.
When will SNL be funny again. Ever since it started making fun of Presidents it sucks!!!!
I love Donald trump and alec Baldwin this is huge I mean ugggggggggeeeee
Honestly politics aside I don't even see how thats funny at all. Also they did fat shaming on Sarah Huckabee and make fun of mental diseases which is something they criticized Trump of.
This crap has absolutely NO class. SNL should have been off the air  30 years  ago.
Very funny,  well done and so true.
Lol wahahahajaha😂😃at least he's talking about the Truth but funny way 😁😂I love the show lol wahahaha hi from San Juan.

Snowflakes keep falling on my head. Lol Beta Cucks

The Jeff Sessions girl is hilarious.\n\nFur-ightening.
The Comment Section is more hilarious than this video.
Just throwing this out there on my base alone we've sent 3 engineer units to Puerto Rico just off my base don't believe what the media tells you as funny as this is
Haha 😂 LMAO 😂, this is Hilarious! F**k Trump 🐷
They make him seem Stupid......
KEEP PLAYING AROUND GUYS.   YOURE doing us all a favor
There are shootings in Las Vegas and SNL is worried about dissing President Trump? BS
Alec is such a shit stain loser. And SNL has fucking sucked ass for decades.
Give us something new snl
Kind of bad timing for a video like this to trend
Nobody watches SLN especially these losers. I didn’t even know it was still on air lol.
The guy from The President Show deserved the Emmy, not this fat, alcoholic asshole.
Horrible, really bad show low ratings for sure.
Dude SNL there is more than just Donald trump out there. Get creative and stop using recycled memes
This is the stupidest thing I have ever watched. I’ll never watch another SNL show again
Wow just wasted 6 minutes of my life watching this
SNL making fun and lying about our president, the president of the United States. And we have 100's of Americans being shot in domestic terrorist attack. PATHETIC!
SNL is full of lies. Wtf is this shit.
Why the fuck is this third on trending instead of important news about Puerto Rico and the Las Vegas shooting.
What a bunch of SCUMMMMMM.
Stop insulting half the country you idiots.
Holy crap man can we please see something that doesn’t have anything to do with Trump for once? At first these were okay but now it’s just like holy crap man quit cashing in on the Trump viewers.
Jeff actually looks hot
dumb
Saturday Night Live has been dead since 2016, thumbs up if you want to make this top comment.
kill die warfare triumph nuts, murd I will fukyo mudah moodahfookah.... ahhhfooka you CIA BACKSTABBER pussyassed hiding boysfook a.   uuuuuuuu
Wow so triggered you keep at this
FUCK SNL
Alec Baldwin is so fucking overrated as Trump. Trump doesn’t even talk like that.
Keep in mind that Alec Baldwin saved the world from nuclear war long before Trump was president. Even so he was replaced by Harrison Ford....Baldwin referred to Ford thereafter as the little quiet guy. James Earl Jones continued on with his same position in the CIA until cancer finally got him in A Clear And Present Danger....
Subscribe to my channel anyone
You motherfuckers and cocksuckers better not make jokes about the LV shooting, killing, massacre. Nothing funny there ass holes.\nAll of you are on thin ice now, and any jokes about death will further piss everyone off. There's no way to get out of that.
Any video this dude is apart of goes viral, that's why I love him....
Bet Mayweather could have beaten it like he beated his wife
It will take me a year of mowing lawns but I will buy these wheels
Is this the same santa cruz that makes skateboards?
Nooooo I go to this park!!!! How did I miss this!
id love to try these wheels, I think a proper test would be some small flairs
This kids a troll
This is a true run flat wheel!!
Whats that bike helmet you are using please?
This was a really. Really. Really. Good advert :) \nI want one... bad!
Dan, u are a fucking beast.
Overpaid asshat destroys expensive garbage...please take my money. \n\nMan I love capitalism!
Let's see if he has these wheels on in his future videos seeing as though he was so impressed. My guess is once he's been paid the money for making the video, he'll switch right back to his favourite wheels again...whatever they may be. If he keeps this exact make and model (new set of course), then we know for sure that it's not the money talking! 😉
this is painful to watch 😔
well gess i could get a set now i know i will not abuse them like he did they should last me 4 years with my ride style
Not much surprising about this. Carbon is more resistant to deforming than aluminum. Its weakness is hard impact. Almost nothing here was hard impact, just sustained small impacts
Just needs new tape. It'll be fine.
This hurt my soul.\nIf I owned a pair I would probably??? \nForget it all I can afford is watch you enjoy them lol
I guess we don't need tires anymore
I call dibbs on the front wheel PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
What's the music in the background?
Most people never realise how strong carbon fibre is. It's incredible stuff.
Wow. I guess Santa Cruz has proved their point....
Now blows from the side to the wheel, that would have been even more interesting even.
These Santa Cruz kids need to stop breaking there wheels
African kids could've eaten that wheel...
This should lead on to a Super ...Super Glue advert...
Biggest Casinos in world Where you can be lost for ever \nhttps://youtu.be/aKXOLJWiOwk
I wish he’d put pegs on and grind handrails. Or just ride a BMX. That’d be interesting.
I wanted a bike Santa cruz so much, I just do not have the conditions 😔
If you want to make your regular bike sound like a motorbike put a bottle between the back wheel and  back brakes.
doa o cubo para eu (mim)😇
Do they come in 26? 😉
🌴🏞✈️ 🏄🏽Check Out My New Travel Video 🏄🏽✈️ 🏞🌴
give me that bike please :D
I think that the majority of people are hear for DANNY
Santa Cruz is offering a lifetime, no questions asked, replace em if you break em warranty on these wheels.  That's how much SC believes in these wheels.  This is just an advertisement to demonstrate how hard you would need to abuse them in order to break them.
Can you send me a pair to test preferably attached to a Santa Cruz.
WE ARE NOT WORTHY OF THY LORD'S PRESENCE!
alright pretty impressive considering but now hit us with the impressive price
Walk back!??!! Take the back wheel off and nose manual back!
He'll yeah now I can ride with just the rim, no more tires and flats for me!
This is on a DT EX 471 rim, no tire:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUoCSzVmhhQ
Sorry but I still will not trust anything carbon on my bikes. Seen way to many parts explode. Not just crack a little and start creakin, just f'n explode.
Shame they going to be Over the TOP expensive
Why didn't you give them to me?
I really want to change the subtitles on this, it's not even near what he's saying 😂
I need these wheels for my fucking bmx its so ideal for high drops!!!!!!!!!
USE A HARD TAIL IT WILL LAST  SECS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thanks for wrecking the steps!
That was very interesting, but lateral stiffness wasnt really tested imo, like doing a 90 oder 270 at high speed and hammering the bike down on the ground
What kind of bike is this?
he broke it lmao
Are those 26 or 27,5?
Will Stanta bring me one??
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟👍👊
SAnta Cruz products are far too pricey
I want that redbull helmate 😋😍😍😂😂😂
Damn!
credit to Taiwan
Stan's NOTUBE Bravo wheelset are still better.

More info about what happened @ goo.gl/b5Nh2T
MOST LIKELY this happened because he has been ripping a bibles onstage...
I don't wish injury to anyone but honestly, I didn't know he was still performing.  I thought he retired.
Hes ok, remember kids he had his ribs removed so he can succ his own dicc. he simply folded in half until the prop was removed off him. no damage done. thank god.
Hes gotten so fat his gravitational pull was bound to fuck him up
Lol, a bit of a Spinal Tap moment. Act of God for being a degenerate !

Dude you're a genius. Your creativity in music is astonishing.
Wait why the fuck was I unsubbed
why is he looking so angry?
Hey. Do you think they'll be a full version for the final boss soundtrack?
I always love the music in water levels!
I've seen this man smile meaning I can die happily now
I missed him staring into my soul while he plays piano 😄
Top ten video game anime themes.
I feel like this guy only ever played Nintendo 64.
I need a full version of the boss music
make more hip hop please!
You make it look way too easy
just realized I have the same PC case.....
You're seriously one of my favourite people on the internet.
Oh god that last note at the end lmao
The last sound was my fave.
I like your laugh
He must be saving his capitalised letters for an all caps title.
someone legit needs to make full versions of these songs...PLEASE
Would you marry me?
that greg was really hard to beat! D: even after using trainers, i would still get low health! oh Lord GABEN WHY?!?
He’s so damn intense
How do you think your cat feels when the video says dog in the menu screen?
Hey. This is nice. Thank u
Whoever makes a game and uses this soundtrack gets a dollar
Gotta love how the part where Seth smile is actually photoshopped in and he doesn't actually smile
Agent 47 has got some musical talent
What on earth is going on with this apartment??
This is hilarious omg. You always crack me up
I need the boss theme released as a standalone song
1:03 Why isn't this a song.\n\nI want this to be a song.
You have to do the extended version of the final boss theme pleaaaaaaase ❤
you beat the game by winning.
Cya in a year
i love how the end music its the same of the first video.
This is some legend of zelda shit right here
I lost my shit with the boss theme
This was AWESOME!!! Can I download these somewhere? Well done, man.
Youtube! You did it! You actually for ONCE put something I wanted in my recommended! 🖒
Y he always look so angry
First one reminded me of loz:oot  but this reminded me of chronotrigger
love your Anus sweater. where you bought it?
Yo, you should post things more regularly, your content is so nice and rare! Keep it up, buddo.
I thought his shirt said anus at first
DUDE You are INCREDIBLY talented oh my god !!!!
men if you upload piano tutorial  videos i wonna love you or ever
Yay I want another one
My neighbor came over so I could beat Greg for him
It's not a true video without that last note at the end
This was uploaded in my birthday! Also if there was a full playlist on YouTube with all these songs completed that would be feeling awesome! You just earned a sub, mate
Yo fire and air level are my new jam
wtf i just watched the first one like yesterday
Can I just say I freakin love you so much!    Thanks that is all
Like, I'm not even joking. You need to compose a soundtrack for an indie video game. I'd buy it so fast.
I would hire you to make music for my rpg
Someone scan the barcode behind his head
OMG can you please do a full version of the boss music? :0 IT SOUNDS SO GREAT!!!
God I love your videos!😭 thank you so much for this lmaoo😂
That moment when you realize its not an ANUS hoodie.

*achievement you've died 1,000 times*
Im glad to see your cat helped some how!
love that you stayed true to the theme of wearing the same hoodie as the original :)
Okay, I have to be completely honest with you. I thought your sweater said anus, because your pullstring covered the middle portion of the H, I am.... so sorry....
But wait. If Donkey Kong's in the earth level, then is he in the water level, too? And if it's a Donkey Kong Country water level, then it's actually awesome!
Feel like I actually just played an entire game
Tip: to beat the game you have to win
please full soundtrack, especially the fire level
My internet went down right at the loading part, 1:20, so the screen said loading for about 10 minutes, lol.

1:19 ooooh you touch my ta la la la ooooooh my ding ding dong
well played Seth.. well played
DT is still only fun when they lose
Arsenal are doing good but DT u over expect everything. You said oh West Brom had chances u expect them to dominate every game of course the other team will always get shots off u can’t expect them to keep the opposition not have a chance.
Robbie you should make playlists for every team we play and add on them the next time we play them
DT complaints way over the top sometimes. why not win ugly and get 3 points than dominate and get nothing and still complain.
Mad that DT gets more views nowadays than Claude
DT is RIGHT! we're doing well against lesser teams but let's see it goes against the bigger clubs and I don't mean just drawing against them! I mean solid performances and wins. Coyg!
This bloke is a total cock !!!
Sanchez don't even want to be at arsenal why back a judus
DT needs. To chill relaxing like he's beast.
'Lacazette looks clinical, he hit the post today' ffs
DT is one of the few Arsenal fans who have a true sense of perspective. \n\nBut we all know how the season's story is going to turn out for Arsenal. We don't need DT's wisdom to tell us. Because we've been reading the same book for thirteen seasons.
When are arsenal fans going to understand that arsenal is a mid table team glory days are over
Why interview a moron? Couldn't give a toss what he thinks. Whinging bloke can't even speak English, I'm embarrasssed for him.
Am i the only one who cracks up when i see the view count that aftv have when arsenal wins and then compare it to when arsenal loses? Lol
C'mon DT just chill man. Every team has problems. I know Arsenal have been playing some shocking football, but can't blame the defence all the time. Look at Real Madrid today. They won 2-0 but Espanyol had 2-3 really good chances. I know that you had enough of poor Arsenal, but start supporting the team rather than critizising their every mistake.
They could have had this they could have had that... could have and should have are two different things!! Are you forgetting that arsenal also hit the bar and had more chances in this game?? Think you need to stop being a pessimist and support your club.
well said DT. today's game was just too slow and not scoring the needed goals
DT is right on the money... except for the contradiction regarding the squad making progress. If we have the potential to compete for top 3 then that's clearly progress compared to previous analysis stating we probably won't make top 4. \nI'm Still #WO (since '08)
Alexis is the number one arsenal
Didnt know why iwobi was in the background.
Sorry but arsenal fan tv would not be the same if you won the league and cups because DT n Troopz wouldnt be mad. Love there reactions 💯👊🏼
Ramsey and Giroud totally overrated! There is more goals in Wilshire and Walcott at the moment!
While the Manchester clubs and Spurs are banging 4 against so called lesser teams, we are just about scoring 2 and riding our luck. Bigly. \n\nWe need to sort this defence and also get Sanchez, Laca and Ozil playing together. That front three could do wonders for us this season and when Jack gets in (if he can keep this form), our midfield can be way more creative than the staleness we are witnessing now. \n\nBut much of this wont matter if we dont sort this defending out. Wenger should try 4 at the back and see how we play. Its been a while but I think we'd be more solid.
Riding our luck Our xg was 2.9, Brighton's was 0.4. DT is a complete moron
I never even knew Alexis had haters he holds are team on his back he is Arsenal.
DT is on point right there
when Arsenal win Robbie has to get 'creative' with video titles...
is this fatty ever happy if we had lost he'd be screaming we have to learnt how to win ugly theres really no pleasing arsenal fans take the 3 points and the clean sheet and move tf on
DT ...I hear you on the poor performance...but we slowly getting the 3 points...
I don't get it half the time we lose we moan we draw we moan we win we all still moan what the hells going on we still won don't care who were playing we still won lol
3-4-3 Formation is killing Arsenal's season
Really poor? They won two nil.
If Alexis leaves then let's see how this team copes. The guy was a star player for Barcelona in his last season
DT is only being like this because he deludedly thinks that he may stay.
I hope you're dream comes true my dream is to get 100 subscribers by the end of the month can you please help me with my dream?!!
Once we  start playing the ball sideways it is Xhaka's role to collect the ball and spread the ball to the right forward. When the game gets boring we should blame him, he is our engine at the same time passing the ball sideways can be a way to rest after running so much and try to pull the opponents. #wearethearsenalfc
Again DT is absolutely right! Arsenal progress with frail teams but crumble ever so easily against big and technically strong premier league clubs. If Arsenal beat Any of the top 6 teams away the same way we beat lowly rated clubs in the premiership, then the world can take our title credentials very serious, as it is there's no amount of points you can amass from smaller clubs that can justify winning the premier league trophy.
Alaba you've had your 10 goals go away!
Again with the trending wtf is going on,but to be fair the lets talk about the game comment was hilarious 😂😂👍🏻
https://youtu.be/uupZlTULD1w this will help you get over your shit game
It is too early to talk about signs .. he is correct we have to see how we play away in the coming 5-6 premier league games.. Everton, Man City, Watford .. would be the test.. Hope we rest our players in europa and EFL cup .. and then put up a performance like we did at Chelsea and this time take 3 points not just 1.

Good job Arsenal! You have avoided defeat for weeks!\n\nIn other news, Robbie has reportedly been delaying his downpayment for a new mansion, citing 'temporary loss of income' as the reason.

I dont get the sanchez haters.....i really dont. I said b4 its likely people who cheer on wenger that booo sanchez but its beyond that. I genuinely think they dont understand football and aint worth debating with.
The emerates has the worst atmosphere out of every league!
Next week well be very interesting goo.gl/b5Nh2T
these ungrateful fat fucks never touched a ball in their greasy lives stfu!!!!!!!
Dt on point
Arsenal is shit, Chelsea for the win
Give Aresnal team some credits pls... as for DT .. I dun know who u are... but seems like you are nothing but a very negative person.
I think Alexis, maybe because they both speak spanish, has a better understanding with Monreal than with Kolasinac, on that left side. Hopefully with more matches Alexis and Kolasinac can get a better undrstanding and improve each other performances , because Kolasinac is a beast, and Monreal is having a amazing season in his new position so i wouldn't change there positions.
Why is this even a topic. Laca should have played sanchez in for a tap in !!
This is actually trending. DT one of the best personality on AFTV
Arsenal should of won 5,6-0
People forget Alexis had some very rough international games where he lost the confederations cup and then lost 2 games (qualifiers). He´s got a lot in his head at this point, not only Arsenal, and this is not to make any excuses, but come on, those fans giving him shit... they should be bothering the board to get rid of Wenger and the lazy players, instead of bothering the only guy that gave everything for his team last season.
i like you DT but do you ever say anything positive
Did you see that ludicrous display last night?
DT is definitely the realest amongst all the other AFTV regulars. He may be biased towards some players but he lenient towards them when they’re shit. I like him better now than when he was all “Wenger Out”.\n\nNot saying that Wenger should stay beyond the 2 years though. ;)
Always in with a chance when it’s 11 v 11, so keep Ozil out and get him out ASAP. Alexis is a done deal- he will sign for another club in January and then maybe people who are fooling themselves that he might stay will see.
These arsenal fans are never happy
Why has Dt got his ears tucked in his hat🤔😱
this is shit we want Arsenal loose so they can bitch wenger out
does anyone else think that robbie looks like a teletubby?
ArsenalFanTV is boring at the moment
DT is the man!
DickHead DT U moaning Fuckboy \nSTFU Bitch Boy\n\nYour boring now
Vibes
Robbies just thinking about how he's getting to Ibiza next week, by his private yacht or his private jet?
Arsenal is shit end off.
hey robbie id like to know if you will be going to the world cup next year, i think it would be cool if you go along with the aftv boys(troopz, dt etc.) like if you agree
Did anyone else notice the Brighton fan in the background? 😂
Big up to DT, always tell the truth
Treatment for whitpatches
FELLANI > LACAZETTE
DT is very childish!
Anyone? Did anyone forget that Arsene wenger should sacked?

I swear DT jinxed Arsenal when we start winning games and go on a run he gets negative and we tremble it's like the players watch arsenal fans tv or something
Btw.. I heard that Carlo A. Wants the arsenal job !! \nAnd cante wants to leave Chelsea after this season !!\nAny thoughts ????
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr_0WA3XxOI
Alexandra owned that dance!! Nice to see the judges give it so much love too ;)
I happen to watch this show on the telly by chance and wow I was blown away by their performance. I have never seen Strictly ever but I might start to watch it now because this pair's chemistry is unbelievable. Absolutely marvellous performance! Alexandra's stage presence is amazing. She's a lioness!
This was *LIT* - cannot wait to see how firey their Argentine Tango is gonna be (whenever they get it)
If they are shagging \nI definitely don't blame her 😂
After this I wanted to dance. I did...\n\nI danced against a door and now my head is aching. \nWhat is my life?
Great British people, I am calling for you to vote for this amazing couple! As I can not do it myself from Czech republic, please keep amazing Gorka and fabulous Alexandra until the finals! And I am going to watch this ten more times.
Alexandra as good as as pro - in 2 weeks !! Paso Doble and Alexandra made for each other
WOW!!! ........and only week 2!! Gorka.......you really hit the jack-pot when you were partnered with this girl!!!!
i sincerely hope that alexandra and gorka don't get the same treatment that natalie gumede and artem got a few years back. in my opinion, natalie has been the very best dancer to appear on strictly (with, or, without previous experience argument). alexandra could well equal the achievements of natalie. absolute pleasure to watch over and over again.
SLAYYYY
One of the best dances ive seen on strictly, loved it! They've got such amazing chemistry together and Gorka, be still my beating heart!! 😍 I thought no one could replace Aljaz as my number 1 strictly crush but Gorka's giving it a good go lol
This dance!!! OH MY GOODNESS
https://youtu.be/fF8W_BDRqWo
Oh my god\nHow beautiful is the male dancer!!!!!
I normally hate the Paso but this was so good :)
This is one of the best dances I have seen on strictly. The song was just perfect too.. I like that they did the Spanish version. But I agree with what Darcy says, the way Alexandra expresses herself to the music is amazing to watch.
I genuinely can't believe the intensity she attacked this with and the difficult technique that she nailed - amazing.
Who knew she could be this intense? I thought I would pass out after watching this dance
I think I have a weird obsession with this routine.. I keep creepingly coming back to watch it.. can't get over it.. and I know this may sound weird but I want them to date.. they are such a great looking pair... Shipping them so hard...
This is perhaps the only time I've thought that Jennifer Lopez song has ever sounded good, haha! A thrilling paso. There were a few rough spins and I wish that the walking transitions looked a bit more musical rather than rushed. Nonetheless, the 36 was definitely justified, in my view. Great choreo from Gorka and it really showed off Alexandra's grace, speed and power.\nOverall, I'm rooting for Alexandra. Despite (thankfully) the few idiotic bores further down in the comments section playing into misomelangyny and claiming she's 'arrogant' and 'up herself', she's a very talented, professional and unassuming entertainer that evidently not only dedicates herself to her craft but also – more importantly – enjoys it. I sincerely hope she gets into the final.
If thats how she preforms the Paso, I CANNOT Wait for her Tango and Argentinian Tango
This felt like the first moment of the series.And in a frankly not too deep field this year,barring accidents, she's a finalist.I have to say I haven't quite warmed to her yet,but that's more about me with driven people.This was a delight by the way.Also I felt she was strangely undermarked last week.
Where the 40 at?
Wow wow wow.
My favourite couple on Strictly Come Dancing this year love them!
British clapping annoys the crap out of me. And i'm British.
If only people were as passionate about spirituality and humanity as they are about dancing lol.
On da floooorrrr
Honestly rewinded this dance more than 10 times last night. Parents got annoyed so I went to bed- secretly keeping watching on YouTube. You're my faves guys- literally was dreaming last night I was dancing with Gorka
OMG love this girl. Amazing and only week 2. It's gonna be fantastic final. Betting on Alexandra, Aston and Debbie in final.

Naturally Get Rid of Pigmentation & Dark spots \nhttps://youtu.be/YEwsstcNSl0
I think that is a very good example of somebody who understands ballroom dancing and the little details of flamenco (paso doble). Very well executed by both.
They definitely saved the best till last. Fab-u-lous as Craig would say. Alexandra danced like a pro, and Gorka looks hot. Not my overall favourites, but one of them (I think it's hard to have a fave this early). It's a 10 from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the new Alesha Dixon!
Incredible! I usually lose interest during some of the dances, but this was such a dramatic and intense performance, perfectly executed, that I had to come and watch it on here again!
she is an amazing dancer... she is a bit smug but honestly this is an unbelievable performance by her for week 2 of the show and not much experience
Great dance for Week 2. 9/10
They are smoking hot….Thank hmmm Gorka has a partner that can dance so we can see him in full view! Yum Yum Yum!!!!! Can’t wait for next week
I Also Think Alexandra & Gorká Would Earn The 2017 Glitterball!
Watched this back so many times now. Mainly, because at least the first 10 times I couldn't take my eyes off of Gorka, he's sooo pretty!!! Alexandra, though absolutely smashed it! You go girl!
Amazing xxxx
Fantastique
Cough cough decency please Man!
Possible Strictly winner??!!
1:30 She was very restrained to not have gone for his lips!
Wow what a performance  , never ever seen a pass like that . Alexandra  you can dance
Can't believe what I'm watching considering it's only the second week. AMAZING!
Brilliant.
😍😍😍
No she did no just slay my life
I'm still amazed at this & it's only the 2nd week!! Thrilled for Gorka who went out too soon last year!!!
Im seeing the final 3 being Alexandra, Debbie & Aston
The best in years since Alesha and fit Gorka too! Loved this in ironic Spanish
Sad none of her music has ever trend on Youtube
I am now at the age where I have started to watching Strictly.. Where is my pipe and slippers?
Hmm, I was thinking before it started: this'll be ok... 0.12 BAM!!! Jump-spin and the fireworks exploded. Definitely worth the score and the standing ovation from CRAIG that it received!
This would have been amazing at any stage... but for week two?  Outstanding!
Alexandra is just beyond talented, she owned x-factor and now Strictly too. She’s a superstar.
Alexandra Burke wow she was once a singer...
Genuinely thought Alexandra was one of the professionals in this episode omdsss
She was so hot and fiery I couldn't take my eyes off her... and Gorka had his gorgeous chest out! =P It was a dance worthy of a 10 or two; and if it wasn't only week two, I think we might have seen it.
I used to love her on X Factor but damn. Her dancing is as good as her singing!
Jls and the Saturdays face ...like WTF face lol hilarious
Get um Alex!
Absolutely sensational 👏👏👏
SSSLLLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
Amazing!!!
You strictly lot need to learn to dance this is how you do it http://youtu.be/uupZlTULD1w
Gorka eres el mejor! Además de gran bailarín, gran profesor. Besos desde España :D
AMAZING FIREY HOT PASSION SOMEONE HELP COOL DOWN THE FLAMES!
WHY DID NO ONE GIVE THIS A 10!!!
Alexandra and Gorka are simply the best better than all the rest better than anyone who's ever been on the show before things can only get better by the strength and sheer excellence of this dance
Alexandra didn't came to play !
Hard not to focus on Gorka but, Alexandra was amazing here. Not only did she dance to near perfection but, she put everything into it and the acting side was epic.
Oh my goodness!! That was sheer adrenalin. Super explosive!! Can't wait to see what else Alexandra & Gorka have up their sleeves for next week. That was absolutely outstanding.
Gorka is gorgeous, I can't take my eyes off him when watching them dance.
Absolutely Amazing, Alexandra owns this dance, her lines, her timing and attitude, perfect, Gorka and Alexandra will go far, if not all the way to the final.
I had tears in my eyes watching this ,my hubbie a London Taxi Driver said to me a psychiatrist in the cab once told him  they were genius tears ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and thats what it was
Amazing dance! But I didn't like the song. 9.0
I'm so glad this _hopefully_ means Gorka will get to stay in for the long run this year. I'm still bitter that he and Tameka were voted out in week 3 last year. I hope this is his year!
Uno what gets me\n Aston has more views for his dance. And I'm sorry he is certainly not as good as this. I now know he will win the show just cous he has biggest fan base not cool
Blooming heck that was amazing!
Who is the most annoying person in the world?\n\nAlexandra Burke by a country mile.\n\nMy idea of hell would be to be stuck in a lift with her....
Omg she's absoulty stunning! Amazing dancer and so much passion! I hate all these talent shows but I'm a little bit tempted to start watching this one because of her but I won't
I adore this dance!
They remind me of Normani and val anyone else?
Just curious if any of you women out there have complained to BBC about Gorkas outfit....or lack of? I mean after all, it is a 'family show'. I mean... .Dont you all go crazy when the pro girls show too much leg or tits? Amazing how quiet you all are when there is a 6 pack on show! Pffft.
Used to admire Alexander when she won the Xfactor, she stated music was her life and all she wanted was to sing. Since her first album I've heard virtually nothing from her. As with most X factor winners they get one or two albums out and then give up and settle for doing adverts when their money runs out. She's still massively talented but I'm disappointed in her lack of commitment to what was her apparent dream.
Ohh shock shock another \nCompetitor that got a big applause .. for dancing well  ..\nOh I forgot they danced before??? it's a fair competion  ok let me see Aston ,Debbie ,Alexander ..I thought it was about stars that never danced before and see how they come on threw the weeks .. it's \nabit unfair as the dancers are a bit disadvantage .
I do get annoyed when Alexandra talks but she is such a talented singer and dancer! This definitely tho is the performance of the night! Possible one of the best paso doble performances I've ever seen actually! 😱💚
One of the best dances in Strictly history. Would have been 10s a few weeks down the line.
I don't get it, this just didn't have the paso feel that Debbie's had last week. Emperor's new clothes springs to mind...
A great dance but you can’t compare her to the others. She has a lot of dance experience and shouldn’t be on an amateur dance comp against people with no dance experience at all
Alexandra is also dance trained yet nobody seems to give her grief compared with Debbie
Too fast and too aggressive needed more content. Thumbs down.
Another one who has been taking dancing lessons way before the series started..pathetic..
Since when did John fashanu join the strictly contestants?

Low class, tacky, sure signs of lowlife losers. I wouldn't get a tattoo if my life depended on it. And if a girlfriend of mine came home with one she can leave and try to be a girlfriend of someone who's equally as skanky.
Now cut it and sell that toe on eBay. Lol.

I bet that guy had a full-blown stiffy by the end of that..... i know I did😓😓😓
I'd get that tattoo no problem by Margo!

Please know that JESUS LOVES YOU, JESUS IS LORD, AND JESUS FORGIVES. We are all sinners. We are all on our way to hell, forever. God does NOT want us to end up in hell, a place of eternal, conscious torment and suffering (Not parties). We can all live in eternal paradise with no pain and no suffering forever. It’s one place or the other. Jesus answered, ‘I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.’ Jesus took our punishment for our sins. This is a FREE gift. Many will never know how wonderful a relationship with Jesus is because they are afraid to ask. Try asking. What do you have to lose? Just ask Jesus into your heart and to forgive your sins. It literally costs you nothing, but will give you everything. God Bless.
Yoooo that thumb nail looked like she had no arm
Wouldn't be surprised if that got infected. She didn't wipe down or sanitize the area before tattooing
The look of sheer terror on Harrison Ford's face when he KNEW he was going to be singled out.
I'm a simple man, I see Margo Robbie, I click
Have I seen that Adam somewhere before???
Id let her tattoo my toe just so she can touch me. ID ask if i could put my big toe in her mouth as well
I'm willing to get a tattoo from her, even though i hate tattoos...\nThat's how much i love her! 😍
If acting doesnt work out anymore...\nShe can make a living doing that... no problem :D\nLove it btw.... Humans are crazy, and this is the crazy i love! :)

It's a tattoo machine not a gun. I would not consider myself to be lucky to be tattooed by her. I am a professional tattoo artist for 13 years now. I have 2 small beginner tattoos and that's it. If your artist says they are shaky but love doing them......Find another artist!!!! I don't care how hot they are or their celberty status.
Hi my name is LaToya a ghetto black name spelled correctly... LMAO!!
It’s sad how accurate this is.
It's always the fat one.
Every female tinder ever: DTF?. Every. Single. Guy. We all have needs. Every. Single. Time.
Tinder likes my dog more than I do
Hi I'm Kaitlyn I love Disney going on adventures and going to the beach
A guy who's been trying to find a partner for the last few months on Tinder, I can confirm this is 90% of what I see.
Lol I just had a tinder ad played before this.
Guys subscribe me i will subscribe you back.\nYess i successfully add my comments into 80k videos😊
mfw I got a tinder ad on this video.
Quick tip; most people you swipe won't even see you on their feed. If they add a Snapchat or Instagram account, follow that instead if you are serious
Looks at incorrect spelling for possible child name...
When you match but no reply
Lmao where's the male version of this thats exactly the same but with pictures of fish
Hahahaaa I can only relate to the only have an account for a joke bit.  I used to have a tinder and I actually had a normal profile, except I had vinn diesel paintings as my profile pictures.  And yet I still managed to meet my boyfriend/soulmate, so hey, Tinder ain't all bad
Hiking, adventures, pictures of them being alcoholic thots, rugby, 420 friendly, dog person, trucks, has a kid, overused quotes, shitty pop music. Why are women so... Indescribably predictable and one dimensional?
I'm sarcastic. Also be sure to check out the picture of me and the drugged tiger. No hookups!
Don't forget I love to laugh
Looking to have fun really means they're  going through  there hoe phase and the just want to hookup
Now do one about black women.
Bears, Beets BattleStar Galactica. Best line in the office.
Tinder thought me girls boring as fuck but they want you to be funny and ect...
I'm disturbed that this is incredibly accurate
Females don't need to put work into tinder
Touch my butt and buy me Pizza 😖😖
I am a microwave
I don't know what this tinder thing is precisely but I use it to start a fire. Sounds like our cultures are similar but we thumbs up instead of swipe right.
Congratulations on making trending and getting so many views so fast!
Hopefully not the fat one
What's Tinder? Just kidding. It's like that old site called \nHot or Not right?
Upload on Sam O'Nella Academy more often please, I would appreciate it.
So Tinder is a dating app? Can I join if I'm only interested in getting my dick sucked for as little money as possible?
Always up for an adventure.... Yah, like spending our money.
Why do girls have to specify that they're not into hookups? The fact that they do makes me think that its reverse psychology haha
Girlfriend does make up on Boyfriend!!😱😍 Video on my channel👍🏻
I'm so lonely. I have nobody to call my own.
i would never get on tinder and besides i have an american pitbull terrier and she pretty much wards off the riffraff!😄
I got a bj using a jar jar binks photo. To bad it was a quadraplic German boy.
People commenting actually know this shit. It's just a observation
Don't forget the bitches who don't respond, or act super interested at first but then suddenly stop responding
That's my profile.  But you have to understand tinder is a mess and I've had to move to match. Basically you go on tinder as a woman and you can essentially date anyone of your race between the ages of 18-40. The guys there seem just as basic. Compared to on match where you actually see people based on your interests.
They're all obsessed with Gin
Most women go on tinder purely for ego boosting, they don't wanna meet up with strange men (what women does). They only wanna see how much matches they get
I swiped right and nothing happened... duped again..
Can't way to the next millennia when you post another vid
By far the best argument I've heard against online dating is, You don't go to a junkyard to find a nice, new car.
Good music for studying and more! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCra6VD5wenzUL-6E_92m4gQ
Oh also forgot. Must be 6'4 or taller
You forgot the part where they all say they're 420 friendly
ok, now do one for men on tinder.
I got a tinder advert before watching this lol
You should really make more videos sam i mean i started watching when the fat video came out and i have been waiting dude your viewing count is going uuupp i mean damm this video is trending. If you ever need any idea for a video i suggest you male pne about the catalonia conquest going on in spain right now
You forgot the girl who has 2 pictures, no bio, no anthem, and no mutual friends. The only fucking thing she has is a link to her Insta.
I have a buddy who has an account on tinder. His only picture is him without a shirt. Can't understand why no one swipes him. I Hijack it all the time and swipe normal looking bitches. All he swipes is high maintenance bitches. I also swipe dudes for him lol cuz that idiot has a better chance with them. Stupid millennials
Oh shit. I guess I'm not as cool as I thought.
The 'dog' part is too true! 😂
Good video,but I don't get the venmo comment at the end lol
Jesus, reading these comments is fun but I'm so fucking glad I'm not on tinder. Sounds like a depressing game. We're not meant to meet ppl like that!! I'd rather stay single all my life than sink to despair and join tinder or any other dating app. Why on earth would you waste so much of your youth to meet someone with so little substance? It's a joke. This isn't how life and matching up is to be.
Where's the white gay version

Hey guys, this might be an inappropriate time to ask this, but I really need your guys' help. I just started a youtube channel and it has been really hard to get started. I don't want to beg for subs, but I think I have to in order to get the ball rolling for my channel. I make weekly how to videos and if you can check it out that would make my day. The quality is terrible right now, but I found out a way to change that. I rushed to get videos out in the beginning and that was a huge mistake because the quality is pretty shabby. A short glance at my channel would be really awesome, but a sub is always treasured. I'll try to sub back but it's not guaranteed. Thank you guys for reading this!!! Now don't waste your time reading this comment, but watch some fantastic videos!!!

Ryan is honestly the greatest youtuber of all time. 10+ years, more than 20 million subscribers, still makes dope content consistently, while not quite as often as he used to. All of his videos are funny, well thought-out, and he clearly puts so much effort into all of them. Even after more then 10 years of making videos, I still enjoy every last one of them. I have grown up watching this channel, and I’m sure many other people here have as well. I personally believe that Ryan is irreplaceable on YouTube, and that when he finally does decide to “hang em up”, it will be a very sad day. Ryan, I just wanted to thank you for all you have done for everyone who watches your videos, because they are not just a piece of entertainment, but part of who I am. Thank you.\n\nOkay that got sappy af but it’s all true tho

My teacher said to my I'm a failure, that I'll never amount to anything. I scoffed at him. Shocked, my teacher asked what's so funny, my future is on the line. Well...you see professor I say as the teacher prepares to laugh at my answer, rebuttal at hand. I watch Rick and Morty. The class is shocked, they merely watch pleb shows like the big bang theory to feign intelligence, not grasping the humor. ...how? I can't even understand it's sheer nuance and subtlety. Well you see...WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB! One line student laughs in the back, I turn to see a who this fellow genius is. It's none other than Albert Einstein.
This is such an asshole comment, but even though Ron Paul ran as Republican, he's pretty much daddy libertarian.
s\np\no\ni\nl\ne\nr\ns
To be fair... you have to have a high IQ to understand the Game Theory.
No evil morty at the end of the season...
IM gonna killin myself the more i see these...
SCIENCE <3 RICK AND MORTY.\n\nI love ittttt
You said that Avocados are rich in Trans-fats which are necessary for for healthy brain function. Avocados actually contain no Trans-fats which are in fact all around unhealthy and have been linked to negative health effects on the brain. \n\nI believe you mistook Trans-fats for saturated fats. Mono-unsaturated fat takes up more than half of the total fat content in an avocado.\n\nYou might consider adding a correction to the info that states a diet high in Trans-fats is not healthy for anyone. Including Pickle Rick.\n\nI am not a health nut or a dietician. Simply someone who who noticed possible misinformation and didn't want it spreading among those uninformed about a relatively healthy diet.
I only threw up three times and cried twice
The real question is how the ruck did pickle Rick have infinite ammo in his arm cannons?
So was Dan also inside Matpat's recording chamber as they were recording this? (aka Matpat's closet)
I'm surprised PETA didn't protest these guys with the roaches
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewers head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenevs Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. \nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid
HOLD IT! If you were to look deeper into it you would realize at the very least rick doesn't have a skeletal structure, ergo a skull. What this means is that the swelling of his brain and nervous system is a non-problem as his brain wouldn't be pressured into a stone-like container such as the skull and his pickle form would adapt to his swelling nervous system. Even in the worst case scenario he would only die when he regained his humanity as the salt content in his blood would immediately kill him, but otherwise pickle rick is entirely possible.
#sixseasonsandamovie ! community reference, bless u dan harmon for creating the single funniest sitcom
I think the main part of the pickle would be that it is acidic, and that would stimulate a charge in the brain
I find Rick and Morty's art style so unappealing... i cant watch it...
everything in my life has lead up to me watching this video
i just watched season 3's finale... Dan either lied or rick's morty is evil morty because their was only one morty in that episode... im confused now about this since Dan said. just wait until the season finale this sunday.
Wouldn't the salt shrink, not swell, your cells?
Am I The Only One Who Noticed That The Schmeckles And The Pictures Of Rick Are From Pocket Morty's?
There's a lot of cool things here... But mostly that a pickle is an electric condiment

It’s a cartoon and your trying to make some massive meaning behind it, just think, the jokes a 10yr old can get there head around ahhh I can’t it’s sooo bad I’m sorry ahhh noooo please ahhh GIOVANI HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A CARTOON I QUIT arghhhh it’s a pickle ITS A PICKLE ITS A PICKKLEEE OMG AHHHH ok I have to leave this video bye
So Dan...you KNEW evil Morty wasn't in the season finale... but uh...you heavily implied it to generate hype anyways.\n\nDan, c'mon you're better than this.  You don't have to lie for promotion.
I don't like Rand Paul, but Ron Paul was great.
So i have my own theory. So you know how rick and morty are c-137 d versions of themselfs right? Well i think that evil morty is the real c-137 and rick had thought he had died during an adventure and went out to find a new morty. But the dimension that the real morty is from that rick died but noone in the family knows that but rick and has to lie to everyone just so he can hide his greif. Meanwhile evil morty became president of the citidel so he could be in a position of power and kill the c-137 rick to get revenge for leaving him behind. But hey, thats just a theory a film theory.
I love how he acknowledged Dan Harmon as the creator of Community with the six seasons and a movie jab. Truly great
Except in organizing the pickle body, Rick could have had the plant cell nuclei combine to be the equivalent of a human nervous system.
hate this channel so much, Jesus especially him constantly showing his ugly ass face for fucks sake please and stop just get rid of that feature. does anyone else hate this dumb asses attitude, he just wants to make you punch him in his dumb ass face he just has that attitude like hes better than everyone and his stupid animated emotions don't help.
Dan Harmon you lied to me. you said we'd find more out about evil morty in the last episode but it wasn't that at all! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!
I'm pretty sure that wasnt Dan Harmon
READ THIS COMMENT PLEASE IT MAKES ME FEEL SO  HAPPY ABOUT MYSELF when you do\n\nIs it hard or easy to have a rectangle(mor or less) edited too have your mouth move because I'm thinking of creating THE FILM INVESTIGATOR  *igator*  igator (echoing).\n\nalso hey mr.Harman  maybe you and matpat can help me with an idea for a show on game theory,I call it The Theory-verse,imagine rick and morty combined with Pen Zero Part Time Hero combined with every single T.V show and game that there has been a theory on (including Doctor who) combined with Game/Film Theory/lab +GT Live ITSELF (plus me cuz I'm the creator of the show) all in one blender of shows facing off against the anti-master (like antimatter) who is trying to get.........50(that should give me a couple of seasons) pieces of an ancient wepon that would give him tne ability to take over the entire multiverse
Considering we didn't see Evil Morty since s1 it'll be some time. Especially with Beth... <_<;;; This is going to get real next season and Dan Harmon is hoping to give us more than 10 episodes.
Wait but his organs are mechanically enhanced so Matt you got your lunch.
I recently entertained the thought of playing DND with the creator of rick and morty and now no other thought can satisfy me.
Lets talk Evil Morty.  Dan says, Just wait until this Sunday at adultswim... Evil morty wasn't in the final episode... I was sad
Who else saw shawn spencer at 6:35
14:40 It would not cause swelling it would cause shrinkage followed by a return to equalriblum because the water would first leave the cells and head to the salt and then the salt would go into the cells via diffusion, I learned this last week
Damn Harmon you fat lazy failure. My dimension didn't receive an evil morty ending, instead an un-gripping bullshit ending.
He lieeed !!! We didn't get to see evil morty in the last episode :c
Wouldn't shoving a giant metal spike into your brain kill you?
Matt's google search history must be weird
To be quite frank, one does need to have a rather significant amount of intellect to comprehend Richard & Mortimer. Why, just yesterday I attempted to show my cousin (who has just entered his seventh year) the episode where the titular character, Rick, turns himself into a pickled cucumber. He laughed at the mere thought of a man become fermented vegetable, but I sat there watching, lamenting the deeper message: the death of intellectual pursuit, the desensitization to societal filth, muck, and mire, and the shameless abandonment of psychological understanding.\n\nAt the end my cousin turned to me and proclaimed, I am the scientist that was once named Rick, but I have now become a pickled cucumber. Look at me, I am pickled Rick!, and I could not help but smile, not that the line he had just recited was humorous, but at the realization that this, in front of my very eyes, was the sum of what the episode had just warned against.\n\nI cannot blame my cousin just as much as a man cannot blame a dog for consuming its own bile. It merely does not know any better, and what could be said about a man who judges things he does not have merit to judge?
I never cringed the most in a lesser amount of time than i have watching this video.
00:38  You mean like you did with your own chart on Part 2 of Gamers Are Ruining Games?  When you said the RE series was going steady when the actual chart (if you bother looking at it) showed it clearly wasn't?
Avocado Rick really doesn't have the ring on it
You assumed that Rick could turn himself to a pickle and manage to stay alive, therefore the brain dammage is neglected (since he can survive being a pickle). Then, the theory of pickle Rick is logical under the assumtions of the show is actually valide
damn this is just fucking retarded. Vegetables or fruit or whatever the fuck cant control fucking rats you dumb fucks
I can't fucking help it. This guy is a fucking fruit... I can't lol I can't be alone
winter is comeing now its here now wait for two more years!

As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎(COPY AND PASTED BY ME! I do not own this amazing speech of this highly intellectual viewer of the Season Rick And Morty
is nobody gonna mention how tales from the citadel could be a reference to tales from the borderlands ?

*I'M A PICKLE MORTY*\n*I'M A PICKLEEEE*
Dan Harmon is woke
2:33
matpat show up on harmonquest PLS!!!
Yeah fuck you Dan. Evil morty wasn't in the finale.
Wait\nI just watched a debate about a pickle.
Do ManBearPig, the video we all deserve
Reason he survived as a pickle is because when he was in the sun the sun dried up most of the pickle juice
DAN LIED ABOUT EVIL MORTY ALSO THE FINAL EPISODE OF RICK AND MORTY WAS HORRIBLE IT WAS ONLY ABOUT BETH AND JERRY GETTING BACK TOGETHER, THE PRESIDENT (of america), AND THEORIES ABOUT BETH BEING A CLONE.\n\n\n\n\n\nsry for spoiler
I love that when he was talking about salt he showed overwatch to display the salt levels, genius Pat\n\n\n\n\nI play overwatch so I know how salty people can get...
Spoilers for the latest rick and morty\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nJerry is back in the house. The entirety of this season he was divorced but now, at the end they bring him back. Let's look at the date of the episode he was kicked out. Season 3 episode 1, aired April 1st. Now he's back. \nDon't you get it. We got pranked hardcore.
Aaaand he fucking lied about Evil Morty.
This is annoying
Did that look fake to anyone else
“Good God almighty, good God almighty, that killed him…as God as my witness he is broken in half”
it's fake, now back to my porno because that's real
It looks like he hurt his lower back during that takedown and his opponent notices it and be like fck it Im Doing the Walls of Jericho Maaaaannnnnn!
YOU JUST MADE THE LIST
it looks scripted
WWE fans here>
you know what happens when you use the walls of jericho without jerichos permission ?\nyou know what happens !!
Looked scripted to the fuck..
Fake as fuck
You do realize when applied properly, a boston crab will get you a submission...I've done it; just sayin'.
Kudos to FCC for putting this video up. Outrageous and incredible finish. Jonno Mears is my new hero.
Next please God let someone win a mma match with a RKO or a Stone Cold STUNNER
The way the guy was making weird faces the whole time, and just laying there like a fish out of the water... Looks fake, still fun submission tho
here is a vid I did years ago on half-crab, and a half crab was ACTUALLY legit done in Indian MMA a few years back fyi https://youtu.be/fA1NxkhnYdM
Probably fake but still that move hurts like fuck, anybody with older siblings who are WWE fans will relate all too well
Fucking easy. I always do this to my sister. Lol
That was a pure set up .Pure theaterised shite. Mma fans of purity will have seen tight through that one 👎
Back in 199X it use to be Boston crab now it's Bolton who?
That guys back looked broken from the takedown. Why would you even MMA if you can get beat with THAT pro wrestling move.  Tough way to make a buck
I had the Bolton Crabs ! strange really ? As the Crab had a shaved pussy ?
He knew what he was doing all along, you can tell he had already planned it
That looks set up  and definitely not walls of Jericho
About as real as a leprechaun flying a unicorn
Dana White's Lookin For A Fight...... won't be lookin here!
imagine if it was the lion tamer
guy hurt himself on the takedown, thats why he could get it
Really looks fake wtf! Why would anyone agree to being embarrassed like that
Looks 100 percent fake.  I've been rolling for over 10 years and NEVER seen anyone lay there while a guy fumbles with his legs, or roll stomach down from love taps.   Troll.  That was the SLOWEST leg grab / clumsy as hell transition that I've ever seen.
CAN WE GET A STONE COLD STUNNER NEXT WEEK.
BREAK THE WALLS DOWN
Break the walls down
LOL he gave him his right leg.. all he had to do is extend his right leg, get on his right hip and shake his left leg. i cant believe people are falling for this fake bullshit
It's fully legit and it would break you in half . It's all about posting luck we're you end up out of a scramble. This is a rare finish to get the two legs
Alright, Now if they can pull off a Figure-Four or a Sharpshooter, then maybe I’ll watch an MMA match.
Aaron Jones looked hurt after the takedown, then took a good shot to the right eye and went defensive belly down, he was hurt and in cover mode so the boston crab was easy to setup. I think this is legit. You watch too much UFC and you forget there are some pretty bad fighters out there who can get caught by something like this
He tapped only because he hurt his back, You can see him grimacing from pain after the takedown.
fake nothing else to say
You just made the list !
Fake as fuck.\nThat dude got a pillow punch to the face @:28 and turtled up his face leaving his legs limp for 3 seconds as if he was asleep.\nI call bs
Boy was that set up. No way in hell a pro fighter would let anyman sit on his back and slowly grab both of his legs smh. When i saw this i thought there was going to be some crazy set up to get the sub but that was just one guy allowing the other guy to do it wtf is that bs
That looked so homoerotic
Ha
NOT FAKE
FAKE
Fake.
Jericho mears
Looks faker than WWE.
Fake as shit
looks scripted
jajajajajajaj que malos tio
BOSTON crab. Not Bolton.
FAKE
WWE FAN HERE
WWE
MMA fans are the most retarded fans in all of sports. Everything is fake except mma 😂
some moves are in the WWE are effective in real life combat situation
Faker than WWE
Get the fuck outta here lol
was actually a single leg crab but still was THE WALLS OF JERICHO LOL
Jonno gets style points for sticking the tongue out
It's not the walls of Jericho.  Jericho puts a knee in ur back
Punches were half hearted. Reactions to them were too strong.
Guy hurt his back and was winded by the fall, this wouldn't have worked if his opponent was not in a weakened state.
That gay gave that to him
GOAT
LOL

The second spear looks hurt
Liberals think this is child abuse.... Your going to jail now!
No kids were hurt at the making of this video.
Good way to get the kids tired and off to bed early. RKO into a pillow, nighty night lol.
I hope WWE sees this and gives y’all free tickets or something!!!! 😊
I was waiting for your video, and it was AWESOME\n\nSee you next year =D
When u know cuteness trends on YouTube
Hey you know all those disclaimers in WWE that say Please, Do NOT Try This At Home? They'll be the reason you get to pay out of your own pocket for your child's medical care for the rest of his life once he is paralyzed from the neck down cause his dumbass dad thought it was cool to encourage him to imitate pro wrestling moves even to the extent of jumping off a ladder. Great parenting. Remember these videos when you try to sue WWE for your heartache and medical bills.
See you next year guys!
I knew he had it in him, the older guy had no chance.
This is gonna be my brother and his son 😂😂😂 OR EVEN DAUGHTER
When i was a kid ..I used to do this with my younger brother every day after dinner ....🤣🤣
Did... the kid hail mary before he jumped off the ladder??
Why is this called annoying? He looks like he's just having fun with his son
Admit it wrestling fan, you did wrestling some moves to your son more than once.
obviously FAKE, fake sound effects 0:19, the choke slam at 0:05 (boy smiling wtf), you can tell there isn't any crowd either, its all a rip off from the real WWE and no blood from all the impact? so OBVIOUS
Some quality father and son bonding right there !
I wanna to see a Swanntom bomb off the ladder.
We had pile drivers in our day. Now we have pick up wheel chair basketball games on the weekends if anyone is interested.
When the kid was shaking his hands, priceless.
Cant believe there is no perfect parent comments about how this is abuse etc
That little boy looks so happy!! Ohh wait... that's the dad!
So, this is once a year..
Lmao this guys such a good dad
As a parent this really angers me you should be ashamed of yourself......... it's no way in the world I would've let him hit me with the leg drop from the latter I would've jumped up into a rko
508 people clearly don't have kids
G.O.A.T. video, end of story, get out.
A 20 second video #20 on trending🤦‍♀️
Nice mate you really cracked me up
When mom goes to the store
“I’ll set up the camera, son. You get the ladder”
Best part was that last slap one
Hopefully you monetized the video. Put the money in his college fun
To be continued: September, 2018
I'm calling child services.
haha this is so cute\ni like the hair flip at the beginning 😉
The kid in the thumbnail is about to get a football head.
The Beast System is the Church System... All Church's,Any Denomination, They all are part of the beast system. Pastors feed sheep polluted bread so they continue to look for spiritual highs.. Many People when Jesus comes are gonna say didn't we do miracles didn't we heal or cast out demons but Jesus is gonna say depart from me I never knew you because you were told that God's Law was the Old covenant and that going to Church on Sunday is sufficient to go-to Heaven. THE CHURCH SYSTEM ANY CHURCH IS A LIE. GOD WANTS US TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS AND BE THE CHURCH!!! COME OUT OF CHURCH SYSTEM AND RELEGION AND INTO GOD'S LOVING ARMS!!\n\n\nRevelation 18:4\n\n4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues\n\nHowever, the Most High does not dwell in houses made by human hands; as the prophet says:\n\nProverbs 7....
I once did this with my dad and it was awesome until I punched him in the balls.
This is good parenting
*At **0:18** That must've Hurt*
These need to be more than once a year. Awesome.
This time plz don’t wait so long to make a new one
Dad of the year award goes to THIS GUY!
What part of do not try this at home do u not understand
This is next gen parenting. I have a 5 year old son and 1.5 year old daughter. I need to step my game up.

Love!! Keep vloggin
I watched it all the way through. It’s not a bad video if you can get past the cheesy humour. I was relieved he didn’t try to defend or justify the use of violence, even if it is against some truly despicable people. You're expecting a long comment, so I think I'll just paste the rest of my Tumblr rant here.\n\nI was also glad to hear the de-shirted Nazi admit he was just doing it because “it’s fun”. Something about that just feels less threatening than the ones who have convinced themselves their actions will somehow prevent a white genocide. Because the best liars are those who can deceive themselves. And it plays right into their victim narrative.\n\nLet’s talk about that victim narrative actually. The reason why hate groups are able to pass themselves off as “peaceful protesters” or whatever bullshit term the media calls them is because they have an opposition that is so predisposed to physical force and silencing tactics. Why throw the first punch when they can have Antifa do it for them?\n\nIt’s a very common strategy used among the right, like that guy who went to the park dressed in a Confederate army uniform and got some press covfefe when people started violently threatening him, or that time when Sargon sat silently in the front row of the audience at a Youtube panel and waited patiently for Miss Sarkeesian to give him a punishment. Both men got what they wanted without the moral burden of starting a fight. (Also, the mental image of Carl Benjamin as a class clown who makes fun of the teacher behind her back but never technically breaks a single rule is just too perfect.)\n\nI was also going to mention that Simpsons episode where Bart manages to ruin Lisa’s babysitting career by acting like a provocative little shit until she nearly kills him, but that’s not the best example - all she ever did was injure him accidentally.\n\nWhat Antifa are doing however is different. They are going out their way to retaliate, and in some cases striking pre-emptively.\n\nI’m not going to make myself popular (among the left) by saying this, but I really think the best thing Antifa could do right now would be to stop punching Nazis. It may feel like a small victory in the short term, but every time they do so they just end up playing the villain in a neo-Nazi recruitment video. And when that recruitment video is the news, that is a really big problem. It also doesn’t help that the black bloc outfit lends itself to dehumanisation narratives, and that American news doesn’t take kindly to groups who use communist iconography.\n\nMy plea for non-violence will almost certainly fail, because Antifa groups have decided that the diplomatic solution has failed, and that violence is the only option. I respectfully disagree.\n\nI do believe that the active Nazis who attend rallies are few in number. The number of people sitting in their houses and cars with unexamined racist biases is many thousands of times bigger. And unlike Nazis, it is actually possible to win them over. But the more one tries to stamp out their beliefs with violence, the tighter and tighter people will cling to them.\n\nNazism is recruiting. The most powerful recruitment tool it has is the victim narrative. Any attempt to silence Nazis with physical attacks or loud noises is playing right into their hands.\n\nAnd whilst it is true that both sides do not have the same objectives, my fear is that nither side has any interest in de-escalating the conflict. In fact, their actions suggest that they are both actively trying to escalate it.\n\nThat is why I agree in principle with what Antifa stands for, but I cannot support them in what they do.
WTF??????  Why is no one reporting that *Trump murdered Helen Keller* with a double ended dildo?!?!?!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n#SaveTheLube
The states have gone to shit in the past few months.
This was AMAZING. Cody & Cracked are doing an actual service to the American public and our discourse. I mean, this is really insightful and useful and just damn GOOD. Thank you, guys!
Are you WildSmiled? Your voices are exactly the same!
I'm gonna keep watching this, because I find it to be an excellent news resource; however, it's super depressing....
Whether it's a Nazi or a Libertarian, you have no right to shut the event down through violence. ANTIFA completely disregard the 1st Amendment and perpetrate the violence in almost every single instance. No wonder top security officials are recognising them as domestic terrorists.
Thank you, keep it up. Excellent journalism! you have no idea how funny it is to see you, I know that your suffering is real, you wanted to provide comedic relief and ended up being a reasonable opinion screaming out common sense and values. Such a tragic story for a comedian, a bit cassandra-esque if you ask me. Love your performance and your writers, keep at it guys your community needs you.
You know Anonymous should data mine the comment section of this video to unmask the neo-nazis's here.
I agree about what your saying but antifa is actually out just to start shit there just as bad as the Neo-Nazis. The recent protests at Georgia tech show this. The unfortunate reality of how the kid died was suicide by cop, he called them on himself and after a 15 minute standoff swung a knife at an officer. He was quoted on the phone saying I am a danger to others stop me, or something akin to that as he called the cops on himself. The protest in under 2 days was hijacked by antifa to start shit. Literally nothing else. Neo-Nazis are Neo-Nazis but these guys are just as bad hijacking legitimate protests or vigils for their own agendas. To quote Rick Your both pieces of shit I can prove it mathematically
Didn't watch video and it's still wrong.
Terrorists. Can you imagine if the right acted like antifa?
Now I'm seeing people call the Las Vegas shooter a member of antifa. Every time this happens there's a mad scramble to associate the shooter with your opponent of choice
Antifa is a terrorist group, there a bunch of Violet dipshits. if you don't want to be called a violent dipshit don't join Antifa. that being said the video was generally well made and i do agree how it's weird that the media is willing to acknowledge Antifa's wrong doings but not the wrong doings of white supremacist.
Can't say how much i appreciated this video.  Good job,  guys.
Antifa are actually the good guys!\n\nAntifa has beaten random passers by over the course of the past 5 years.
Cody tries to weasel word his way out of supporting TERRORIST COMMUNISM GROUPS. ANTIFA beats up the elderly and children, burns down businesses and steals property. They are murderers and literal terrorists working for the Jew George Soros. Cody has stooped to supporting terrorists, racists, and murderers. He is basically scum now. Immoral to the core. Downvoted.
We all see through your bullshit propaganda, and we won't stand for it. Unsubscribed.
I wish there was a way to subscribe to Cracked humor but unsubscribe from cracked politics
What the fuck? No, we DON'T have to support one group of violent thugs just because they're punching people you think are worse violent thugs (and who, importantly, VERY RARELY EVEN ARE.)\n\nI have no trouble believing you are absolutely sincere, and so stuck in your feedback loop of confirmation bias that you have no idea how much important contextual information you have omitted. You really believe that the media has a right-wing bias in this case, and that your misleading selection of facts fairly represents the issue. It's both absurdly hilarious and legitimately terrifying.\n\nBut Christ it's hard to debunk your shitty argument when it is so drenched in misplaced smugness as to make it painful to listen to. You come across as insufferable to anyone who doesn't already agree with your point of view, and according to these comments, plenty of the people who do. I swear I'm focusing here on the content of the shit you're saying and doing my best to ignore the way you're saying it, though.\n\nEveryone hates antifa because their ideas are as fucked up and violent as the fascism they claim to oppose, AND they are much more common, much more widespread, and much more of an immediate threat than that fascism. They constantly fight people who are NOT fascists because there are so few fascists to fight. And yet just about every major city has its own antifa squad of angry, politically illiterate young people.\n\nAnd yet we don't have white supremacists everywhere. We barely have them anywhere, and their presence is hugely exaggerated by the same paranoid moral panic that told us Trump's election would see white supremacists marching in the streets night and day. What we have for the most part are not white supremacists, but white guys who are sick of being told that white people suck, and trolls who are amused by the lack general leftist lack of a sense of humour which you exemplify so well here, taking advantage of said moral panic by masquerading as the invented boogeyman of the modern literal Nazi.\n\nThis is why we need free speech, and talking to the 'Nazis' instead of punching them. For instance, there are lots of understandable reasons people are concerned about 'defending the white race', even if that goal is misguided. I've talked to a lot of people who think whites are being made a minority, who live in places where that is factually correct. These people don't think other races should be exterminated, but they're being lumped in with neo-Nazis to bulk out the numbers of some imagined opposition, because it's a lot easier to be outraged at a Nazi than to consider their concerns as a fellow human being.\n\nYou can't just call every right-wing issue a 'dog whistle' in order to conflate all centrists and right-wingers with white supremacists and neo-Nazis, though. There are defensible stances against increased immigration, in favour of state rights, smaller and more local government, and against well-intentioned but ill-conceived legislation against things like 'hate speech'. But you have to buy into the obnoxious slippery slope that says, somehow, that all centrists are nationalists, and all nationalists are ethnonationalists, and all ethnonationalists are white supremacists, and all white supremacists are genocidal modern Nazis. There are some pretty big leaps there, but you're happy to make them as long as it gives you more Nazis to punch.\n\nConfused why there were the same amount of denunciations of antifa as of literal Nazism after Charlottesville? Because there was a violent clash between two violent groups. Except that in the case of the far-right, those who were violent or who sincerely believed in Nazism were EXCEPTIONS. Most of them held milder stances or were trolling for shits and giggles. Every antifa piece of shit that showed up fully believed in the godawful antifa manifesto of anti-liberal political violence. They were the RULE for their side.\n\nStop spreading misinformation and supporting violent nutcases. People who liked this video, PLEASE get out of your echo chamber before you suffocate. All the people disagreeing with this video aren't saying that Nazism is great and they hate criticisms of Nazism, they're saying that this video supports the idiotic false dichotomy that says we must support an overabundance of far-left communists in order to oppose far-right neo-Nazis who very barely exist. Violent protest against mere THOUGHTS or WORDS is never a good thing, and YES this video IS ACTUALLY MAKING THAT ARGUMENT.\n\nAlso, fuck that last bit of garbage about 'the punch will get as much coverage as the murder'. The punch will never get as much coverage as the murder, and these cowardly shitheads know that. The actual reportage was interested in the murder and so few news sources mentioned the violence of antifa that people like you were genuinely confused about the fact that the OPINION PIECES (not the news) were more even-handed. But focusing on opinion pieces and not news headlines or televised reporting (you know, the stuff that's actually read/seen) helps you build your twisted narrative without having to worry about facts.\n\n(Bonus points for taking the SPLC as an authority on who the bad guys are and where the violence is coming from. The political bias in their idea of what constitutes hate makes them absolutely ludicrous at this point. They call moderate conservatives, Islamic reformists and marriage traditionalists hate groups and extremists. Whatever you think of those stances, they are far from extremist in and of themselves.)
You all are doing some really great work here. Thanks a million.
antifa are communists. commies have killed way more people than natzis.  end of fucking story.
Cracked coming out in support of Antifa!? surely not! I am shocked! shocked I say!
Horseshoe Theory isn't both extremists are completely the same, it's the extremists on opposite sides have more in common with each other than those in the middle ground. For example: Neo-Nazis and the Antifa group By Any Means Necessary (conveniently left out of the video because, as Cody would tell you, Antifa's wrongdoing is so negligible as to warrant almost completely ignoring it, which is just as bad as the mainstream media overstating it.) \n\nThey are more similar to each other than to the average person because they both believe in race-based discrimination, (BAMN against white people, Neo-Nazis against everybody else) both believe that violence is an acceptable response to those who disagree with them politically, and both try play the victim afterwards.\n\nHow is Antifa like the Civil Rights Movement exactly? What rights are they campaigning for? What good are they doing by causing random property destruction and attacking those that they deem fascist?\n\nYea, 10 years is probably too much for vandalism charges on protests, but given how much of a problem it's become during protests, *something's* got to give, and Cody's flippant attitude comes across as Pfft! Why should anybody get in trouble for destroying someone else's property? They're just things, maaaan. The same goes with the pedestrian protesters blocking traffic. Just running them over shouldn't be legal, but they shouldn't be blocking traffic to begin with. In both cases, just because people have a right to protest, that doesn't mean that we should excuse it when those people do things they shouldn't just because, hey, it's a protest.\n\nAnd warning against the Neo-Nazis and their blind adherence to their dogma while continually stressing that Antifa are nowhere near is bad as them is fine while the Neo-Nazis have a bodycount and Antifa are simply assaulting people, but will that still be true if and when Antifa does become as bad as Neo-Nazis? When we have to keep countering their protests because they're bad and wrong becomes we have to stop them By Any Means Necessary? Or will it still be okay because they're not Nazis, or because they're called Anti-Fascist, or because they target the right people?
People more valuable than property? Ha! Not in America :(
Over the last 117 years the far right has been responsible for 12 million deaths. The far left 110 million deaths.
Confederates = White Supremacists? Didn't you cover that guy who said these people are latching onto confederate history and perverting it?\n\nAlso Heather Hyer died of a heart attack, and most likely wasn't touched by the vehicle. -_-
Better in depth news than any cable channel out there.
How is far lefties causing violence a false narrative? are you fucking retarded? If antifa engages in and instigates more violence than neo nazis and i can disavow ALL NEO NAZIS how can you now disavow all ANTIFA. they may not all have engaged in violence, although antifa as a movement IS NOT PEACEFUL. They (as a movement) send people overseas to train with militarized anarchist groups, and coordinate in the streets to bash people a leave before the cops get there. Beyond that they are ALL communists. which means all of them want to strip away freedoms and rights and engage in language and thought policing. literaly every member of antifa is a bad fucking person.
I'll save you 23 minutes of your life you won't get back watching this love-letter of apologist drivel for domestic terrorism, here's the abbreviated version:\n\nCody thinks that Antifa's domestic terrorism and violence is ok because other hate groups commit violence too...
I can't believe how many of the same people who complain about how mainstream media is deceptive are disliking a video actually showing how the mainstream media is being deceptive.
This was much better then your last video, but please... please .... stop sounding so whiny. I support your message, but you come across like my 13 year old son complaining about his homework.\nYou supply a decent ironic and sarcastic diatribe, but you have to work on your delivery. Sounding like a child who just lost his Xbox is not necessarily a good way of delivering an effective message of outrage and dissent...\nI hate to say this, but if you can't evolve from this irritating teen concept you are going to lose most adult listeners
I honestly don’t think he’s defending Antifa in this video. He clearly stated that they are in the wrong when committing violent acts. I think what he’s trying to say is that members of the group are goaded into violent acts by people who stir up conflict. He also made it clear that they are foolish to fall for goading tactics.\n\nIn any case, I thought the video was entertaining and informative.
So refreshing how this report cuts through the bullshit
Thank you for making Some News.  Keep up the good work!
you like showing clips? Show the clip of an Antifa member hitting a guy in the skull with a bike lock. even in the clip you showed they are using their propaganda signs as weapons
These arguments are fucking retarded. The smug arrogance of it is disgimusting. I'm leaving the left , I'm done.
The cognitive dissonance is strong with this channel
Fringe lefties committing violence is used to create a false narrative of fringe lefties committing violence? Gee something about that sentence doesn't parse...
Wasn't the guy who killed the two dudes on the train a bernie sanders supporter? I'm pretty sure he was.\n\nHoly fuck, you really gotta shove anti-police rhetoric into this as well? You're not an antifa apologist, you're one of them.
The police, capitalists, the state have been brutalizing the working people of all races and cultures for centuries. When you cant rely on the law to protect you, and when capitalist corporations invade your neighborhood ruining the local economy, ANTIFA are there to fight for human rights. When you see broken windows and fires started by anarchist groups, ask yourself if maybe Starbucks deserves to have its shops ruined, or the police maybe deserve to be put in their place.
fuck the far left. fuck the far right.
You just went full leftist retard, never go full leftist retard. I used to like your content, but now it mostly turned into leftist bullshit propaganda, basically another buzzfeed
Here at CRACKED, we support Antifa... as long as they are beating the shit out of people who say things we don't like.
It takes some fucking massive mental gymnastics to defend a terrorist organization
this guy is legitimately the best news anchor
Don't forget about all those racist windows and buildings at Berkeley that provoked Antifa protestors into breaking them!  Why does everyone gloss over windows as if they never antagonize people???
The Lodge's video absolutely tears this one up.
I used to think I was taking crazy pills, then this show started. I feel sane but pissed off.
The DPRK is a democratic republic, too.
Islam isn't a race, it's a backwards religion founded by a murderer and rapist.
He quotes the SPLC which has labeled the Oathkeepers as a possibly terrorist organization. A small amount of research into that group shows that to be far from the truth.
Great work lengthening the episode more content definitely an improvement!
I freaking LOVE YOU Cody!!!! Keep up the good work Cracked!
Holy fuck did you guys go way, WAY out of your way to make a claim the guy who harassed the muslim woman and stab 2 guys was part of the right wing protest groups (at 3:15 into the video). How fucking far do you have your head up your ass to try and see that shit as indicative of the 'right wing', and yet claim people who are dressed in 'black bloc' who are gathering to counter protest (and not getting the proper permits, unlike the free speech and right wing protest which are getting the proper permits) and attack people. From the likes of likes of Bike Lock Man among many, many more who think that free speech is violence. Or how about when Antifa went to berkely bringing smoke bombs and explosives, and openly call for violence. Calling All free speech rally's white nationlist rally's, when they arent is bullshit of the highest magnitude. Like far left calling Ben Shapiro a nazi and white nationalist fascist, or calling anyone who does speak at any free speech movements 'white supremacist'.  Calling anyone who isnt further left that Bernie Sanders 'nazi' or 'diet nazi' is just a scapegoat for your claim of violence against someone just because you dont agree with them. \n\nIts one thing to push a narrative, but its a whole different story when you are making bold face lies to make your point. Both right and left getting violent at protest/rally/march/etc are wrong. But the difference between the free speech rally's and antifa protesters is that the free speech rally's actually got the permits to group up and dont predicate free speech as violence.
One of my main problems with this video is that he likened Antifa being declared a terrorist group to when actual civil rights groups of yester year  were declared terrorist groups. I'm not saying he says Antifa is good, nor are neo-Nazi groups shouldn't be considered as such, but when you imply that there is such a comparison to Antifa, Proud boys, etc. to the likes of those civil rights activists, I can't help but think you're trying to make Antifa seem not all that bad and painted in the wrong light. Just saying.
Stand with anti-fa brothers and sisters\nDeath will come to the right wing.
Cracked, love ya but this was horrible. They are both shitty groups. Stop trying to shove a political opinion down my throat.\n\nDon't care how they are reported on as they are both wrong.
can I say that, \n*Antifa* vs *WhiteSupremecist* \n\nseems like,\n*Fascism* vs *Nazism*
I'm not going to condone the trolls or the far right idiots but you can't act like ANTIFA hasn't started their fair share of violence and trolling and calls literally murder people. Their own mindset and tactics are fascist by their very nature and their name and publicitiy is used in the exact same way as the crying neonazi.  You can try to twist it however you like but ANTIFA are exactly what they THINK they are fighting against and are no better than the far right trolls that they're getting into fights with.  In Just the same way the other media sources are taking sides you were also (quite obviously) also showing your bias.  \n\nI'm not going to pretend like coverage is equal on either side.  That said, your dismissal of the horse shoe theory was a little swift.  Even if it wasn't true during the civil rights era doesn't mean that the theory simply doesn't exist.  \n\nAdditionally, if you're going to go the not all ANTIFA members route then why has the organization not denounced the more radica ANTIFA members?
I thought that terrorists were a group of people who want to take down a government forcefully... damm... I need to revise my vocabulary!
Two wrongs make a right! They started it! It's okay to be violent if you agree with me!\n\nNo, wrong is wrong. I don't care who throws the punch or who mocked who. the Correct way to cover ANY news is to report the facts and not pick an ideological side. Your bias is clear in your presentation. You were emotionally charged and sarcastic, which makes it hard to follow any logical points you may have intended on making. Hell, it doesn't even matter if you were entirely 100% correct in your facts and morality. Your presentation closes any open minds you attract.
You assholes down here in the comments attacking Cody can fuck off and go back to blowing Trump.\n\nAlright- feel free to correct or educate me if I'm wrong, but this is my takeaway from this; there are a bunch of nazi (or alt-right) protests going that are defending free speech which is not about free speech but about the right to be a fucking fascist.\n\nAntifa is a group going to these protests to attack and fight these alt-right protestors.\n\nI don't see anything wrong with fighting goddamn nazis.\n\n'But what about the peaceful protestors!' you say?  Not shooting or fighting people doesn't mean peaceful if your message is hate. They are nazis and the non-violent protestors that get caught in the crossfire are fucking morons for marching with nazis.\n\nNazis=Bad or am I missing something?
If you take a look at Italy pre-WW2 one comes to an interesting observation, a rise of anti-fascist movement that was just as violent as the fascist one, long story short anti-fascist groups just made the far-right liked more by the general public and inedverteadly helped them get to power quicker, thats what ANTIFA does, you dont need to be kicking down up post-boxes  and beating people to pulp with shields because you stand against fascism, theres no bad publicity to the far right, just fucking ignore thier meaningless prostests...
Are you saying the media is right winged?
People, he isn't criticizing Antifa because the news already did that. He is simply stating facts about Antifa's opposition, as they appear to be Fucking Neo-Nazis. Antifa are getting jailed for bad behaviour at protests when Nazis and fascists get away with their behaviour that was literally provocative of the worst of humanity. People looking for a brawl and dragging politics into it because they think its funny to get someone jailed for life for not being a nazi... dafuq?\n\nAmerica, you suck. Keep your crazy extremists away from every other country. Extremism is ALWAYS awful. Whether left or right. Black or white. Christian or Muslim or athiest. Supremacist or Feminazi.\nWhy can't anything be a more balanced solution? Why does everyone in America have to stand on a side of the see-saw when you could find more room if you found a stable place in the middle?
15:45 ...I watched the broncos win the superbowl, still waiting on my ring though.
Remember when Cracked actually made actual jokes rather than used the leftover zingers that weren't funny enough for Larry Wilmore's canceled show? \n\nI wonder if the 1.8 million people that subscribe to Cracked did so because of what they fondly remember about Cracked from 10 years ago: hilarious Seanbaby articles, great user-submitted works, and lots of interesting historical articles.
How to cover antifa? This was a purely defense refraim to make them a victim. Im disappointed. Cracked has given witty and fair satire on almost every aspect of our culture. I thought you were better than this. This isnt funny. Its nothing that hasn't been done by news stations. Its pure propaganda. Dislike and unsubscribed
I love the longer episodes, they're so informative! Please make more episodes like this

https://youtu.be/RmNz2jGzsDA
ANITFA is a psychotic radical Communist terrorist group who'll attack anyone just for taking a picture of them. Why is Cracked defending them?!
Aw. Look at all these snowflakes being triggered by the fact that Antifa is in fact NOT as bad as Neo Nazis,\n\nBecause, ya know, THEY'RE NAZIS.\n\nNot only was this video hilarious (in a sad sort of way) but also completely true. Suck it you Nazi loving shit lords!
You cant punch someone into agreeing with you, if antifa wants to beat the alt right they have to not attack its about winning the war not the battle dont be a tool of the alt right. These extremists on both sides are bad for american democracy. Antifa are attacking completely innocent people just like the neo nazis and thats why they are just as bad and to pretend otherwise is a lie. Lets not forget the people being shot by fire hydrants defending the rights of black, if they started killing cops like antifa do you think segregation would be over? Violence leads to violence not acceptance. The left has become intolerant to ideas and lables anyone who disagrees as sexism if there male and racism if there white or asain leading to the growth in the alt right. Discussion is the only way to solve these issues. Love is the only way to beat hate. Antifa us doing the exact same thing as the neo nazis and thats why its getting worst. cracked is just cherry picking just like many right wing groups do and both sides are in the wrong so why defend any side unless you have an invested intrest.
I made it 4 whole minutes in until your misplaced smugness caused me to write this.\n\nYou are implying at the start that the right wing marchers were violent...where is your evidence of that? Because someone who responds to words with violence, is the ONE IN THE WRONG. No if, ands, or buts, they are wrong. So unless the Patriot Prayer people were violent BEFORE ANTIFA SHOWED UP AND STARTED VIOLENCE or you can show the patriot prayer people started the violence with ANTIFA, you are ignoring the truth. Where is your overwhelming evidence of their violence while they were marching without ANTIFA? Also, who threw the first punch? Pretty big question for you to not even touch on. Seriously, you keep saying the Patriot Prayer aren't violent, like it is the most retarded thing you have ever heard, and yet you provide 0 evidence that they ARE violent.\n\nThe second thing I noticed is you put up a picture of someone with a confederate flag shirt on and called them white supremacists while implying they are neo-nazis. This is just horseshit. Having pride in someone's history =/= Nazi. You are being stupid. Yes, it is stupid in my opinion to be proud of the confederate flag, but it isn't a fucking swastika you dumb ass. Unless of course you are like ANTIFA where you define Nazi as Someone who holds differing beliefs from you.\n\nThird, you stated that they show up with shields and sticks. 100% true. You know who has a longer history of showing up with those AND has a history of throwing explosives and bricks into crowds of peacefully protesting people? ANTIFA does you blind ass hat. They are the ones who kept doing it, so ya, people started bringing shit to defend themselves. Go figure. It's almost as if ANTIFA escalated it, and then the other side did too in response...strange how that works.\n\nFourth, and I must admit, having stopped the video 4 minutes in, this may not be accurate with what you say later, but you seem to think that someone being a white nationalist or neo nazi means they can be attacked for their ideas. FUCK YOU (if that is what you think). This is America, where people can say whatever idea they want and you can't touch them. ANYTIME, someone uses violence to shut down speech, THEY are enforcing fascism. I personally think neo-nazis are scum, but they have the same rights you do. I know you don't like it, but fuck you, that's why they are rights.\n\nFifth, 1 person doing something bad outside of a protest they were apart of is not equivalent to a group of masked ANTIFA doing something bad while in the middle of a protest while claiming to be ANTIFA. We have video evidence of countless occurrences of MANY masked ANTIFA causing violence, assaulting people, and destroying property IN GROUPS. If they are not apart of that, then why are so many of them participating? How come you never see the real ANTIFA break away from the violent groups or try to stop them? They all just stay in 1 group. If THAT is not ANTIFA, then what IS ANTIFA? Where are your examples of ANTIFA NOT wearing black and masks? Where is your example of ANTIFA NOT being belligerent and violent when they don't get their way? 1 person can't represent a whole group, but the the whole group can represent itself.\n\nSixth (remember, these are critiques from 4 minutes of video, Jesus you are a biased reporter) It isn't a false narrative if it is true dumb ass. You literally said this exact quote, I'm not saying Anti-Fa did nothing wrong during the Berkeley rally, or that it's good that they are allowing alt-right trolls to bait them into fights. These fights are used to create a false narrative of fringe lefty's committing violence.  You JUST ADMITTED that they started the violence because words they don't like baited them into it, and then in the next sentence you claim it is a false narrative that they are starting violence. Fuck you are stupid. I mean, this is so beyond intellectual dishonesty that I think you are just knowingly lying at this point.\n\nFinally, that quote about him saying it isn't bigotry is crap, I agree with you on that. By definition bigotry is intolerance toward those who hold different opinions from oneself. So ya, he is being bigoted if he is intolerant to Muslims. BUT, disagreeing with someone's ideas is the FOUNDATION of Freedom of Speech you moron. Believe it or not, Muslim is not a race. It is a series of beliefs that someone DECIDES to follow. Every person in america is allowed to disagree with ideas, and many find Islam to be disagreeable. And while I agree we should treat everyone how we want to be treated, you can't force people to accept a set of beliefs they disagree with or force them to act as if they think those beliefs are okay. You are obviously a bigot towards Nazis, but is it a bad thing to find Nazi beliefs intolerable? You are acting like him judging someone by their beliefs and principles is in some way as bad a racism, when it is literally the only thing you SHOULD be judging people by. That is not racism, that is critical thinking...something you should try more often.\n\nLike I said, this is only 4 minutes of critiques, some of these may not even apply if you reversed your opinions later on or show were trying to be ironic in the opening. If that is the case, my bad for not watching the whole video. I found your opening to be unbearably supportive of a group of whiny child-criminals. But I have a feeling the rest of the video is you keeping in the same tone of ANTIFA isn't bad or I'm not saying Anti-Fa did nothing wrong during the Berkley rally, or that it's good that they are allowing alt-right trolls to bait them into fights. That quote is you actively trying to push the blame to the alt-right for the violence started by the alt-left, while acting like you aren't. \n\nI legit used to like you Cody...\n\nEDIT: Cleared up my first point a bit...hopefully...I probably just made it worse if I'm being honest.
This video grossly overgeneralizes the media's coverage of Antifa. Antifa regularly engages in domestic terrorist actions that get largely ignored by leftwing media, just as the rightwing is ignoring the actions of the rightwing extremists of all stripes.\n\nEDIT: also, claiming that Nazis are worse than Communists is like saying that cancer is worse than AIDS. There have been well over a hundred million people murdered by Communism. How many by Fascism? 20 million (as a high estimate)? Oh, that's right.

These corporations kind of scare me nowadays because they have so much power and it can corrupt people so much. There’s a reason that in America’s history they had corporations that had to get broken up namly the gas companys from the early 1900s. There’s a reason our economy doesn’t allow for monopolies and because these companies are worldwide with reaching they can cause even more damage and should be broken up as well. There’s something to be said about smaller companies with less reach and more competition
Trump and the ultra rich will benefit most from his tax cut.   You need to watch the filthy rich on CNBC .  These folks have elevators for their Ferraris,  they will be getting the bulk of the tax cut.  Also ask yourself why some of the richest neighborhoods are around Washington DC.   Also need to watch A GOOD AMERICAN on Netflix and see where your money is going, follow the money.
And you didn't mention Alibaba which had revenues of $550 billion in 2016 . . . more than the combined revenues of Walmart and ebay combined.\nThe largest corporation in the world is ICBC, the largest Chinese bank, with assets of more than $3.6 *trillion* and it is larger than the GDP of India.
I cringe when you pronounce Porsche wrong
Wallmart is not the largest employer in the world !
Why was there a Toyota logo on a Mazda RX8...?
Bill gates is no longer the richest man in the world its Jeff Bezos
Samsung gotta be bigger. They make appliances, apples CPUs and screens, their own phones, tablets, tvs, computers, laptops, headphones, they own a bunch of shit too
The East India Company had its own Army, Navy and controlled a large part of India. That's pretty scary!
I think it would have been good to name at lease like one Chinese company like Alibaba so People learn something completely new to them
Last I knew Lipton Teas were a product of PepsiCo not Unilever

this is a great video subscribing but hey i bet amazon take the leading spot over walmart i can tell
I've never seen McDonald's employees that happy
Yeah, we all know Disney rules the world.
Should have thrown in Trump and Tesla for comparison.
Gotta love how many/most of your sources are Wikipedia XD\nMost reliable source of 2017
I don't have a Facebook, or a twitter.
That CATS ad in the beginning made me not want to watch the video anymore. Thumbs down
I'm just very interested in seeing Amazon take down all stores like Walmart, Target and other department stores like them. It's definitely going to happen, just no clue how long it will take
We all know its McDonald's
I'm surprised that with the political clout they have and how they have monopolized the food industry that the companies Monsanto & DuPont were not on this list. An oversight perhaps??
(Reads Video Title)\nIt's Oscorp Industries obviously
Goldman Sachs is the real answer
This many corporations is bad. With this many people in the world i would like to see small businesses take over in their own part of the world
I was watching this video and then he said nestle then I realized oh shit I’m drinking nestle water
Where is the logic when a company is valued at less than 50% of their revenue for the year. The market is crazy and unreliable!
I’m just wondering, where’s the gasoline giant market ?
England's 2nd largest city is Birmingham
Great video! My guess was either Google or Goldman Sachs
FaceBook estimated value of approximately five hundred million is wrong. FaceBook is not worth that much...except if many of the other businesses in this video are also valued as, measuring value of opportunities by what is in the lives of who are, too big to fail (what they use to get what they need).
Qualcomm isn't know very widely but is the second richest company behind apple.
I don't know how you looked at the wikipedia page for Microsoft and learned that they only employ 18000 people. It clearly states they have over 100000 at least.
Toyota corollas? Let me call my friend over here...
This is most famous companies, not most powerful. The only tech companies up there should be Microsoft/Google/Samsung, the rest are just a trendy bubble. Facebook & Apple is literally nothing.
they will all fall...
I think BlackRock should've been on the list. It controlls 5.5 trillion US$.

Corporations are inherently evil because they exist in a realm where now its no longer best to compete, which DOES bring out the best of humanity. Corporations work together now to screw the little guy. And they've purchased the politcal class on both sides the western world over. This is why our representatives don't represent us they represent their corporate donors which allowed them to win the race for the 17th time running... While watching this I was proud to look around my room and not see ONE GODDAMN IOTA OF CORPORATE PRODUCT! If things like adblock didn't exist i wouldn't even be using this website. I have a youtube channel too,  But i don't expect filming myself to pay the bills...
Notice how most of them are American...
Omg it's crazy how all of my friends are creative in some way and just there like :/ ekkk. 100% feel this.
You do realize this video was an art piece right? It flowed like spoken word.
Da fuq kind of job interview is this?
Who thought at first that the thumbnail is sayin ‘ I’m not an autist’ ?
I am definitely NOT an artist. I'm rational, logical and a problem solver, not a creative person. I am not organized, not a people person and too anxious to be a communicator. \n\nYou are a good Youtuber Hannah, because you are a good communicator.
Not to be off topic but I love your little necklace it's too cute :)
I love this video and I really respect your argument. But - I'm afraid I am one of those people who believes that most people are creative in some way! I believe that being able to craft an argument (like you have in this video or like you would in an academic essay), and see a problem in a way that other people can't (e.g. a logistical problem that requires a unique perspective or careful organisation) is highly creative! I'm aware that this all depends on the definition of an artist/creative person but I would take that to be a person wiht original ideas and ways of thinking and think you are definitely one of those people! (p.s. I love your channel a lot but have never commented before!) X
Everybody is an artist; they just don't know it.   \nDidn't you write a book?  That's creative.  \n :
Being organised is just your form of being creative. Yes you may have someone help with your videos but you're the one doing the work and taking about what makes you passionate. Your podcast is another example. It's easy to look at others and latch on to something you can't do. I'm a writer but I cannot write poetry and when my friends send me poems to look over it pains me that I can't create that sort of feeling. You have a book too and it was your idea to get others in to write it. You're creative you just don't know it :)
its kind of a pet peeve of me when people call that creative while nearly all of us are creative but in so different ways! i couldnt come up with the code fore a new computer game like others could. i couldnt sing the way others could. i couldnt be as experimental while cooking without producing disgusting stuff. :D that are ALL forms of creativity. i like to draw and i am good at it and i still make my own christmas and birthday cards but thats only one form of creativty!\n\nso Hannah when you said you where surrounded by creative people all the time but arent one of them i thought wait what?! :D for me you acutally are a really creative person :) YOU WROTE A BOOK. we are the same age and i couldnt even think of doing such and coming up with enough ideas to write down ;)
Person who invented the wheel probably couldn't draw but was certainly creative.
I am NOT an autist
I have developed the skills to make traditional visual art... but I struggle with self motivation, schedules, personal drive and getting things done 😭
Great content and intelligent speech win over doodles or fancy editing any day 😊 The way you think and the things you say are brilliant- could be 380p and upside down, your content would still be more thought provoking and beneficial to the world x
oh great i'm neither creative nor driven or organized what am i to become
I really needed to hear this, thanks a lot
Title:  I am not an autist lmao
okay but why did I cry?
That 'um' was so harmonious
Creativity is a matter of perspective. Isn't organization an art form? Your art may feel different but it's still great!
I love it and I feel you!
10 000 hours, just like anything else in the world. But it has to be something you like.\n\nI guess our generation is used to get what they want right now, we're not use to sing for our super so to speak. Which is sad, it almost bring us back to the era where natural selection dictated what we were suppose to become.
I played the game and it's just plain terrible (in my opinion ) the ads are just fake content (obviously)
Same here. \nBut I love to film videos and to talk about whatever I like.\nI basically would not say I am completely uncreative, at least I know how to draw and to semi good play the violin. But to be honest I’m lazy af. \nBut this is the internet.. a space where everyone is welcome, even if you have no special plans, talents or creativity. There is a place for everyone in here.
I'm not traditionally creative; I can appreciate art but I can't create my own. I used to do speech and drama classes in high school and was good at it because I was always given a script and was good at empathising with the characters. Though when we did voice exercises, they were improv and I was rubbish at that (I'm also rubbish at knowing what to say unless I'm talking to someone I'm close to). And when I do get ideas (usually story ideas) I can never figure out how to transfer that on paper unless haphazardly. I guess I'm too much of a perfectionist. But I've always excelled at and loved maths and science, so much so I'm doing a physics degree. At uni I also enjoy electives from arts units where I get to analyse something rather than create something (I did well in politics and gender studies, and I enjoyed English Lit in high school though the latter was a lot harder and required a lot more effort to achieve a high mark). I guess I'm just not a creator. Which is fine, cos I'm damn good at interpreting, analysing and breaking down difficult concepts to bite-sized pieces.
Honestly this video made me feel so much better about not being creative. I'm good at completing objectives, going through routines, and just getting stuff done. And seeing someone be successful in a creative industry while not being creative. Means I feel better about being able to do things!
You sure seem like a creative to me.  That's why I #thumbedit.
ok i relate to this so hard oh my god, like all my friends are either super creative and artsy or they're super athletic or they're both and i'm none of those things lol. but i totallyvget what you're saying
I read it as im not an autist. Lol
hannah witton queen of getting shit done!!! loved this video so much
Actually, studies show that most of 'creativity' is in fact, hard work.  So, there you go.  https://source.wustl.edu/2006/02/you-too-can-be-creative-it-just-takes-hard-work/
lol I thought the thumbnail said I am not an autist
Wacom tablets are hard it ain't just u
“Maybe I’m not creative, and maybe I don’t need to be to create. I work hard and I’m driven, and perhaps that’s enough.” Brilliant
You have used your skills to give voice to important information and shine light on diverse and interesting topics. that is just as commendable as people who put feelings into songs or paint beautiful scenes with their words. everyone contributes something to this world, and what you contribute is amazing.
One can be creative outside the field of art. Taxes, for example.
'organisation v creativity' brings up some interesting thoughts, and I recently read a good quote that I think fits here: Hard work will always beat talent, if talent doesn't also work hard.\nI know talent and creativity aren't the same, but I still think the quote is close enough.\nAnyway, not feeling creative doesn't seem to have held you back, look at the life you're living in a very creative industry.\n\nI love the video, and your channel overall! You're simply fantastic!
Hi Hannah. my name is Luis, I'm from Lima, capital of Peru but I live in Italy. you are so nice and pretty. :)
Not gonna lie, thumbnail looked like it said ‘I’m not an autist’
You have no idea how relatable this video is!! Love you. Thank you for this.
Hannah you rock. Maybe not the next Van Gogh but you're good all the same
same though? my job isn't creative but my hobbies are- i still play with my college's alumni marching band sometimes, and i sew and cosplay. but i'm not creating my own music, just reading what someone else wrote for my instrument. you don't need to be creative to learn how to read music. and cosplaying is creative but it's more about figuring out how to take an outfit from a screen or a page and make it work in real life. it's just copying a design someone else came up with. same with the crazy makeup for one of the characters. it's not exactly creative when you're just copying someone else's.
This is me!!! Well, minus the math. But still.
not everybody has to be creative! I'd love to be organized and get my homeworks ready before the deadline for once, but nope... that's just not how I role.
you look like dodie on the thumbnail!
Communicating and dealing with numbers all involve creativity! :)
what extension are you using for your chrome dash?
the not-artistic bit is SO TRUE for me! unfortunately, the organisation bit is not lol. so i am uncreative and disorganised and it's really bloody hard to make stuff
You and me both, Hannah, you and me both!
I'm a creative person and, trust me, it doesn't always come naturally. I haven't made anything since June because of a lack of inspiration
OH MY GOD THIS IS MEEE. I'm a musician, study music, and I'm in a band. I've always persued creative subjects, but I'm academic and organised rather than creative because I don't 'make stuff' - I 'work with stuff'. I'm also like Hannah in the sense that I am so good at organising my time/work that I can enjoy time off after my part-time job, band rehearsals, uni work and researching job placements. I can't compose for shit, but I sure as hell can organise a good music event. Fuck yeah to the people in creative industries that aren't creative.
This video is really really interesting because I'm the complete opposite- my entire family are artists, and I've never ever struggled with art, writing, singing, poetry, and I play several instruments. But I'm an engineering student, and I love science more than anything, even though i struggle immensely with maths, organisation, and everything that makes an engineer, so I have to work twice as hard as everyone else. I'm very jealous of you but I also relate to this video!! Hard work is always worth it if you're doing what you love. Thank you for making this video. 💛
I relate to this so much! I'm great at math and analytics, I can find the answer if there is an answer there,  but it's frustrating when I realize I don't care as much about that stuff than I do about creative arts. In uni, I've pushed myself into more humanities classes and it's so damn HARD and so much more time consuming than my stats class, but I love them. I'm finding ways to incorporate how I work, for example my discipline and analyitical skills works great when keeping up on readings and analyzing texts, and I can use my friends stats and math in policy/social jobs. Different skills can come together to make great content even if you're not a natural drawer/musician/creator. It's easy to wish for what you don't have.
Enjoyed this one at Buffer!
You're hired!\n\nWait a minute... this wasn't an interview for job(!)
Even though this video was entirely about you speaking from your perspective, somehow it was exactly what I needed to hear about myself.
I am a singer. I am not creative. It gets very frustrating at times.
I do that DOODLE! I’m a linguist not a creative person and I’m so organized I can relate to this so much. Another amazing video ❤️
Aww great. Now I just want to see wait you were drawing at the end.
I am a good self taught artist... but still find struggles with being natural creative and inspired\nbut I do the things I love and that's why I enjoy doing it..
Keep working hard! I think you're really amazing!
This video was so thought provoking! I've always been a more creative person but in recent years since I went to university I've found that I really struggle to kind of get any creativity out of my brain and into physical form if that makes sense. I feel like I have so many ideas but when it comes to actually doing them my brain just goes nope. I wish I could be organised
This is so me! Loved the video!
I saw that cheeky quadratic formula in there ;-)
THAT DOODLE IS ALL I CAN DO
Well at least she has no self illusions
This is me!! The end part reminded me of my mum in her medical career ‘you don’t need to be clever to do medicine you just have to be able to work incredibly hard’
thanks for making this
You're insanely good at articulating your opinion and thoughts though and you could consider that an art in and of itself.
I don't think that creative and artistic have to be the same thing. Also, I really loved your little Ummm chorus.
OH MY GOD I LITERALLY DO THE SAME DOODLE! I am not a creative person either! What are the chances of that?!
ahh this is so interesting\nI am so completely unorganised i stress my friends out every hour as i wonder where on earth i left my phone/wallet/any other thing that i may have used within the last few minutes. \nbut i am creative\nand because of the total disorganisation that is my life i find it hard to be consistently the same type of creative.\nI've dabbled in almost every creative endeavour there is and gained a lot of joy and passion from every one. but my guitar now sitting in the corner, i haven't made a video in months and my paint brushes are covered in dried paint. \nI wish that i had the drive and the focus to just keep going. to not get distracted and move on before i've even finished the last thing.
Love it so much
2:57 HAHAHA <3\nThis was a GREAT video.\nI'm not creative nor organized. I'm just a mess that happens to have something done from time to time. That's a bad life and i can't change T_T
This video was kind of like spoken word poetry so you are already doing creative things! \nDon't sweat not being creative tho, as a creative person I struggle with organisation, my life is a mess and I'm constantly over thinking my work. I don't get stuff done... and I'm an artist.
Creativity is not merely making art, poetry or music. creativity is all in how you approach problem solving. Creative people find novel ways of solving problems and in fact see problems where other less creative people think a procedure or way of doing something is just fine. The creative people see ways of doing it differently to make it better. This is how many of the worlds greatest creators/inventors thought! I think that you are a content creator with unique ideas, so I think you are more creative than you give yourself credit for.
I love this video so much!
You are different to your creative friends but you know what? You teach us stuff, you help me understand the world around me. You’ve helped me sort my life out a little and for that, I thank you!\nYou’re a brill person Hannah, thank you so much for everything xx
I loved this! Sam Saffold did an awesome job editing. You guys are a great team!
John Cleese claims that if being creative was some natural talent people were born with, he would not have done well. He says it's more like a state of mind that is harder and harder to get into because we get so distracted by all sorts of stuff these days. Something like that. It comforted me a lot when I felt down because I am not a creative person.
what does a woman and dog shit have in common? the older they get the easier they are to pick up
You have no idea how much I relate to this. And believe I know it hurts, specially because I love art but I'm just terrible at creating it. It's really refreshing to know that such an admirable person like you feels the same way :) what a relief haha, and anyway, your content and just everything you say is so interesting and educational, and education is what opens people's minds, it creates new thoughts, the ability of thinking is art... okay I might be going too far; but to me, Hannah Witton you are an artist because you make people  think
I wish I could do maths.. I've got to re-do my gcse next month, praying for a miracle😂
It seems to me that maybe you're more logically creative than artistic. I am quite similar, and I also have a lot of artistic friends. I feel you, Hannah. Cool video :)
I've come to think over the course of my life that the major difference between creative and non creative people is that creative people enjoy practicing their craft. And so they seem innately better but in fact all they're is well practiced. I think what separates people is not necessarily their ability to perform certain tasks but by their desire. For example. I'm not very musical, I leant the violin when I was younger but I barely practiced because I didn't like practicing so I never got very good. However I've been drawing for as long as I can remember and I enjoy practicing so I've slowly got better over time. So now my drawings are pretty alright, (*cough follow my Instagram: @Kameel_sm *) but for most of my life they were just shit. So my point is arty people aren't special they just practice all the time so they seem effortless but if you look back they've done some pretty shitty work.
I am neither
This was incredible
Stunning gorgeous woman.
This is fab <3
That’s ok
Love this, so witty :)
Your voice is so relaxing ❤️
YES
That thumbnail definitely says autist.
love it.
Brilliant!
Amazing!!!
THIS IS ME !!
That was... creative
>Enjoys maths and logic>Believes the wage gap is a real thing
Nice, I love it!
Nice work!
One of those I wish I could've been there things
Nice!

항상 영국남자 조쉬님에 한국어 실력에 대해 깜짝놀라고 실제로 대화해보면 그냥 한국인이랑 대화하는 느낌일거 같아요! 그리고 콜린퍼스님은 인터뷰 내내 되게 편하셨을거 같아요! 굳이 한국사람이 한국어로 말해서 통역사분이 그걸 영어로 통역하는것보다는 통역사나 이런분없이 조쉬님이 처음부터 끝까지 영어로 말하신다음에 거기다가 한국어 자막 넣고 하는게 너무 맘에 들고 그냥 한가지로 표현한다면 그냥 엄지척 이에요!ㅎㅎ 항상 너무 감탄해요ㅠㅠㅠ그리고 존경합니다!
영어 공부하기 좋아요  많이 올려 주세요 please
콜린 퍼스 인터뷰를 Josh가 해서 놀랐다기 보다는 아시아 최초 1on1 interview였다는 게 더 대박이네요.
그러고보니까 킹스맨 한국홍보를 위해 영국남자랑 인터뷰를 한거같군요..? 210만구독자중 한국인이 거의일테니까.\n요즘은 진짜 홍보방식도 센스있다고해야되나. \n조쉬! 전현무 못지 않았어요 ㅋㅋㅋ 멋짐.\n앞으로도 쭉쭉 잘나가길 바랄게요~!
와 조쉬님 이 영상이 한국 지역이 아니라\n미국 지역에서 많이 본 실시간 인기 동영상 25위에 오르셨네요!\n뭐.. 뭐지..? 아무튼 축하드려요!
솔직히 퍼스 옹 무슨 말 하는지 모르겠다 내가 이해력이 딸리는듯 ㅜㅋㅋㅋㅋ
영국남자 jtbc에서 방송한다고 들었는데 축하드려요!!><
이정도면 kBS SBS MBC 여기서 돈많이주고 정규방송해야하는거아니냐 진짜 ㄹㅇ로
영국남자 jtbc2 진출 축하 합니다 앞으로도 구독자가  탄젠트의 값처럼 늘어나면 좋겠네요 \n앞으로  힘내셔서 더 재미있는 영상 만들어 주시고 친구들에게도 적극 추천 하겠습니다
햄을 김치에 싸서 드셔보세요같은 좆같은 인터뷰 안해서 너무 좋다
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 조시 진짜 긴장많이되었겠어요 조시 인터뷰 후기 인터뷰가 더 재미있는듯 ㅋㅋㅌㅋ
ㅋㅋㅋ 진짜 떨렸을뜻~!!   왠지 농담할수 있는 분위기가 전혀 아닌......
와.. '영국남자'를 미국 트렌딩에서 볼 줄이야 . 조쉬 Go Go !! \n가끔 인종차별 글 올라와도 무시해 알았지? 조쉬 격하게 응원한다!! 앞날도 GoGo !!
우린 내각의일원이 되길 원하는데 역시해외는다르구나 조쉬인터뷰 수고하셨어요!ㅋㅋ 나도 실제로 만나보고싶다...☆ 해리하트
콜린 퍼스가 굉장히 편해보이네요. 조쉬 덕분!!👍🏻😌
영상보고 왜 콜린퍼스한테 실망하게 됐지...... 킹스맨은 그냥 1편에 둘걸 그랬어..
콜린퍼스 많이 피곤해보이는데도 정성껏 답변해주네요. 웃는 얼굴이 멋진데 많이 못봐서 아쉽지만 영화에서 보면 되겠죠~ 조쉬 수고했어요!
콜린 퍼스랑 오늘은 여기까지 하는거 기대했는데.. \n아쉽군요 ㅇㅅㅇ..
너무 통제되고 평범한 느낌의 인터뷰네요.. 콜린보다 조쉬 떨려하는거 보는게 더 재밌었음
우와~ 같은 영국인이라서 그런지 몰라도 인터뷰가 굉장히 편안하셨는지 답변을 엄청 길게 해주셨네요~ 우리나라 연예방송 인터뷰와는 넘 차이나서 놀랐어요~ 조쉬님 이제 셀럽 다 되셨네요~^^ 덕분에 잘 봤어요~ 감사합니다(__)
Maybe now he can give you tips on how to dress like an Italian gentleman.
Is kingsman really popular in korea?
wish he or his PR team agreed to do it 영국남자 way, but seriously such a calm and professional interview tho :) cheers to ya!
Josh, you did a great job interviewing Colin Firth! Great video!
A gentleman would unbutton his suit when sitting.
They were proper English gentlemen. Except that Taron is Welsh haha

Thank you for this. This glimpse into the reality that exists in the BVI right now does not exist, and people need to see this to understand. Thanks Sam.
💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
Wonderful documentary showing the resilience of these beautiful people and the strength of community in the face of such devastation. Thank you Sam Branson ! Shared to several groups...
Amazing story. Keep up the good work!
Thank you so much Sam for your big heart. This is a very moving video. Be blessed for reaching out to your community. The people also seem to genuinely love you. Thank you for reaching out and for sharing this with the world. #bvistrong
My home ❤️😭
This had to be filmed didn’t, to show everyone the sheer state and spread the message . No. Everyone knows that people live in awful conditions and when you seem to be doing this to look like a ‘hero’ is appalling
This is just amazing
Is this guy related to Richard Branson?
This area is my favorite place on Earth. I hate that these wonderful ppl are going through this. Thank you for telling the world their story. God bless you!
Thank you for this film Sam, heartbreaking and heartwarming all at the same time.
And you have people in the UK moan over a bit of rain, people take life for granted.
thanks so much  as this film makes it so real, I hope they get lots of help.
Oh my goodness!  I knew it was bad but not this bad.  Thank you so much Sam for sharing this and giving an insight into how devastating the situation is.  God Bless you for your efforts to help these people.
Great video Sam - love to all the guys in the BVI!
I was not aware of the totality of devastation to this area. It's tragic but the spirit of the people in the midst of such difficulty shows their strength. They are stronger than I might be... not complaining, but truthful in certain situations and grateful when they see someone there to help. Thank you!
Thanks for posting this Sam. People have no idea how destructive these storms can be. I've been through quite a few in Bermuda, but nothing like this. So far this year we have been very fortunate to stay out of the path. Right now we sit between two storms for the second time this season.
Good stuff Sam. Thankfully Antigua was spared and is trying to help our neighbors. All the best.
The spirit and attitude of the people of Virgin Gorda is truly amazing.
Sharing Sam. Wish I could be there to help and hug. <3
Thank you from Singapore! Is internet connectivity restored +Sambranson  ?
Thankyou for documenting this.Gives good insight on whats happening in BVI.Am grateful there hopeful and grateful to be alive.It will get better with time.
Thanks so much for supporting this beautiful people in  need , thanks a million Sam.
I'm so appreciate for your good works. Keep going Sam.
Keep up the positive work Sam! Proud of you taking care of other and yourself. Stay safe and continue to have high spirits! Help is on the way! If you need a Master Electrician I'm always around! Don't look back and continue to build for a better future!
Sad to see such devastation but amazing job Sam going in to help! The world needs more people like yourself! Keep safe and positive. Hard times can have an effect on the brain too so take care of each other and you! Heads high and help is coming soon!
Help's coming.  Great job keeping hope alive Sam.
Thank you for this video. My niece is in St John living it & volunteering. Pictures can't show what they're experiencing but this gives us an idea.  God Bless you!
For a greener,stronger and more positive Virgin Islands! Amazing people! Stay safe Caribbean!
Love this..Thanks for sharing your good work!
Bless you all 🌈🌞

These people care about one thing, Living.\nMeanwhile, arrogant Americans in the USA fighting over everything from skin color to kneeling to a slave song (National Anthem)\nPeople in the USA mind is fucked up. Most, not all
How can I physically get involved and help in person, for an open amount of time, not a vacation? I am strong, multi-talented, and can do so many things, like help rebuild, with many carpentry skills, as well as cook, teach the children., an artist that can beautify the current environment they have.  Do you know of anyone who would be organizing volunteers?  Love to all on BVI.\nThank you for your honest and touching video.
David Irwin, Doubled D Charters shared your video out. I lived in St Maarten 10 years, visited VG. After watching hundreds of videos about islands destroyed, yours, reveals more realistic depth of Help, Hope, & Hurricanes, and Love bigger than any hurricane. Thank you. Love & respect.
Brilliant video, Sam Branson - Robin Pinfold and family  are having a fundraising in Cornwall, can we use this video?
Hi Sam. Great video. I’m devastated by what has happened. I want to know what I can do to help. My friends run sunchaser scuba and I was over there just in May / June. The pictures I’m seeing are horrifying and bring me to tears each time. 😢 how are the animals in the sanctuary on Necker doing and on VG?
What I don't understand is why there has been no preparation for this? For an island that regularly experiences hurricanes why are the buildings not being built with concrete and bricks? Why are the roofs not strapped? Why are the boats not pulled into dry docks? There is usually 10+ years between big hurricanes but it seems very little preparation if any has been done.
I just left the horrible side of YouTube. I really needed this video.

Now it's cute but when I do it, I get put in jail
That little lady is gonna grow yp and find out, one day, that she once stole popcorn from Ed Sheeran.
Why didn't the mother tell her daughter off?
what is this Cancer?
Stealing property of the royal family is crime punishable by death :D
That could be one of many of : Harry's offsprings ??? 👉🐒🐒👈
LMFAO -\nHE MOVES HIS POPCORN AWAY FROM HER (in disgust) & THEN ONLY GIVES HER ONE. Nice manners royals..
well ladies now you know how to pickup prince harry, with your children!\n\n\n\n\n\nTHAT WAS MADE WITH ANOTHER MAN, NAMELY YOUR HUSBAND SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO YOU LMAO
Did anyone else see how prince harry teaches her not to steal but gives her one when she asks
Prince Harry’s is such a great guy .. I truly hope he come to he senses about Meghan Markle  before it’s too late
Reminds me of Andy Dwyer from Parks and Rec when he went to the UK
Omg the queen in the first dress can be a green screen! LOL
PLEASE HELP Support Ale! SHe need our help to raise money to fight cancer! All support is greatly appreciated https://www.generosity.com/medical-fundraising/together-by-alejandra--2/x/17437442

DONALD THUMP Take notes.. THIS IS HOW YOUR LEADER SHOULD BE.. SAFE TO BE AROUND THE MASSES... AND THEY RESPECT HIM... THE SO CALLED PRINCE CAN GO ANYWHERE IN HIS LAND WITH WELCOMING RECEPTION... YOU NEED SECRET SERVICE JUST TO GO TO RESTROOM...

Hey guys! There's a little corolla easter egg somewhere in here, so hopefully I didn't make it too obvious! Also like I stated in the video, I live in Texas and I personally know people who have been affected by Hurricane Harvey. This means a lot to me, so if you want to help out with relief efforts here, in Puerto Rico or in Florida (or anywhere else) consider downloading Tab For a Cause completely for free; http://tab.gladly.io/r/reallifelore. You guys are always amazing :)
মুফতি কেফায়েতুল্লাহ আল মেহদও
just let god blow away the hurricane
Well fuck, send a damn hurricane to North Korea then
How many Corollas do we need to stop a hurricane?
Kim Jong un would do this
Wouldn’t the storm spread the radioactive particles, potentially catastrophically?
yeah that's all we need is a radioactive hurricane to hit the states don't go giving Trump ideas people
T O Y O T A   C O R O L L A
drop x number of toyota corollas\n\nNow hold on there
I live in Texas Too.
I have a question! Why does hurricanes only happens in usa?
I came on here to watch someone nuke a hurricane.
Wont the ocean life get contaminated and radiation in the ocean? What if the radiation passes into shipping routes? What if the Radiation gets to water supplies? What if it isn't enough and it becomes radioactive? What it it causes damage to beaches or some populated islands? What about if it misses? So many questions and I'm only 1 minute into the video.
If you nuke it and it did not stop will the storm bring radioactive fallout? Dont sound like a good idea
I can see the sci fi movie now, What happens when nature turns man's most powerful weapon against them a  NUCLEAR HURRICANE!!!!
WAIT I HAVE AN IDEA. STOP ELECTRICITY PLANTS AND JUST USE HURRICANES TO POWER EVERYTHING.
Drop a MOAB into it while the storm is still in infant stage.
I live in texas 2
I dont understand  why they dont just turn them off
Hulk smash would be much more efficient. But even The Hulk knows it's too crowded on Earth
Why we've been thrush one nuke in the commonwealth we don't need shit like this to make it worse think of the settlements
Why use nukes when we can just use HAARP to place hurricanes exactly where we want them. Like they did with Harvey.
Maria fucking destroyed Puerto Rico! My house got flooded ;-; i cri
the nuke will do more damage than the hurricane.
Me at 12am: One more video and I'll go to bed.\n\nMe at 3am: 'What Happens If You Drop a Nuclear Bomb Into a Hurricane?'
But if it happened fish and the area would be contaminated and More horrible storms in that area
texas? only steers a queers come from texas
While it's obviously an obscenely bad idea to nuke a hurricane because of the winds and the fallout, I don't think your argument about the energy really makes sense.\n\nYou say that average hurricanes release 600 trillion Joules per second.  Tsar bomba released 210,000 trillion Joules in under a second.  You then go on to make comparisons about the energy released by a hurricane in a day which is a timescale so much longer than that of a nuclear explosion that it's completely irrelevant.  You could definitely disrupt the aircurrents of a hurricane enough to make the hurricane dissipate with a nuclear weapon even smaller than Tsar bomba, but again, the fallout and winds make this an awful awful idea.
I bet Donald trump watched this
Could a nuclear bomb that hit a certain place in California set off the San Andreas fault, causing the big one?  (question inspired by an old Superman movie)
To destroy the world nuke hurricane mwhahaha
Did he said ty foods?
Drop a Iceburg ..cool down the water
What about just using massive amounts of TNT? I mean, if you're  gonna bomb it, at least use something that doesn't destroy life on earth or give me cancer.
Why don’t we take bikini bottom and PUSH IT SOMEWHERE ELSE?!?!?
what if the Persian empire reunited today?
yeah but, a nuclear bomb would cause even more damage, plus it would swing diseases into the atmosphere such as cancer, radiation, diabetes and you name it.
Why not take Bikini Bottom; and push it somewhere else?!?!?
Apostrophes are not used to signify a plural, dummy.
When call of duty finds it way into reality
I'm now worried about my friend velaria. (She's in Puerto Rico) Maria sucks.
Why risk it if we don’t know tho. But would be pretty ausome to imagine. I guess that’s why this video was made. I’m gonna shut up now and go eat my shoes
what if I just install the extension and then put paper weights on my ctrl and W keys...infinite donations...
Wait you live in Texas? Let just press that subscribe button and the little bell icon
Can you make a video about what if Europe was one country?
But how much is a nuke
what if  earth was the only planet in the universe  (without the moon as well)
Why don't you just throw a million vials of HIV that will show irma.
Shoot your guns at it.
the hurricane eats the nuke and then becomes a flaming hurricane with radio active clouds
This is the most american thing ever
Tab for a cause rocks
What about if you drop a nuke in a volcano?? \n\n\n\nBet no one thought of that
i  went   to  Maryland   during  hurricane Irma
I'm suppose to do a 17 page essay by tonight.    :'(
This reminds me of the OFFICIAL PODCAST
It's called a cyclone
How high does a man have to be to think of dropping a nuke in a hurricane
Don't worry guys, I got this\n*holds up hands \nPEOPLE OF EARTH, GIMME YOUR ENERGY!
Build a giant fan to alter it's path.
I questioned this long ago on FB. So glad I wasn't alone
Well this was originally my idea and the dumbfucks were laughing on it.
I live in Australia
Trump\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLets Just Build a Wall
Control+A+Backspace                 CRAP I DIDN'T MEAN TO DELETE ALL OF SPACE UGHHH
why not harness the hurricane energy and extract enormous power out of it
I live in Texas
I don't think my micro-wave will do anything against a hurricane, y'all are dumb
The first thing I thought of when I saw NUKE A HURRICANE was  DO YOU WANT TO DESTROY HUMANITY?!??!  TO MAKE THAT THEORY HAPPEN IT WOULD NEED SO MUCH POWER!!!! The nuclear fallout would be a gigantic humanitarian disaster and it might even spread and make the hurricane stronger. (Typing this before watching)
I’m too lazy to download that
Viewer from Puerto Rico I have only one thing to say...we're fucked
United States suffers a hurricane and the world moves in solidarity campaigns to assist the victims. Since 1990 people have died of hunger in Sudan, and I have never seen anyone campaign for them. But nobody is racist anymore in the world.
could we harvest energy from it though?
This is the stupidest idea I ever heard. What about all the sea life and pollution plus tsunamis I mean come on
You open a portal to hell and the demons of hell come through and kill all humans
'Would destroy human civilisation' gives no evidence\nPeople that know what their taking about giggle and click off the video.
if it happens the hurricane become fire storm
This sound like somthing Trump would do 😁
my asshole can stop the hurricane bc my asshole is an airbender 🐐💨
You should do a video on how much money and time it would take to build Donald's Trump's wall lmao
DROP 'EM WITH TOYOTA COROLLAS! \n\nYEAAAA
BUILD A WALL!!!
Curiosity kills the cat.
Irma all over again

This guy...love him. So genuine. Beautiful voice
yo get that crowd to sing some in some choir version of this song
One of the few singers that actually sings live exactly the same as studio version. Or sometimes even better. Real talent there
This is even better than the official audio. His voice is so angelic
I didnt know that *Hedwig* was this good at singing Et cetera...xDD

Zzzzzzzzzzzzz
Woo
my acne is cured, my soul is blessed, my ears orgasmed 45 times
God made Sam Smith with 2 souls, one for Sam and one for his voice.
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v67V3KtaSno
How can someone sound sooo perfect live ??!!!!!😩 literally sounds exactly like the studio version
Damn he lost a lot of weight!!! Looks completely different. Looks like a hot boy band guy
Phenomenal Sam! I loved the ending.

he needs to fire his  stylist
I dont know how to say every listen his voice.  More than incredible. I'm so in love with his incredible voice... oh my god. God really gave him really incredible talent.  😊😍
I love his voice and this song 💥
He dresses like a uni graduate that's poor. Lol
his voice is really really great. omg
i love u more and more Sam Smith..I always cry bcoz of your song..I really feel it and goes to my heart!
He is the male version of Adele
even the group doing the backing vocals were genuinely impressed with him, you can see it
This sounds stupid but I prefer his fat look 😁. His voice is perfect btw
Woah I was like who is this person who sounds like Sam smith but doesn’t look like him 😍😍💕🎼
he didnt even try to sing 😊👌🤞
It'd mean the world to me if you'd please check out my cover of this song. :')\n- Love from India.
Holy shit he looks so different 😳 I haven’t seen him since 2014
I thought he have a vocal training.?  Is his notes are supported?
I love you Sam 😭😭❤️

Whats your favorite dessert? For more fun cooking ideas see here:https://youtu.be/tiydbycHA44?list=PLQ_T2NppE0PKNyiZitj427Kuj1lhR6YDy
I have a apple tree... but all it grows is macs sooo it's useless.
If he was Canadian he would say pretty cool ah
Too many apples , also very sweet.
Dude that's a pot!! Not pan my god...
The Lord Jesus Christ is coming! \nRepent of your sins and put your faith in Jesus!\n\nHe LOVES you! Believe it! \n\nPlease do not believe the lies of the enemy. Jesus is NOT angry at you. He is waiting for you to call upon Him! \n\nHe will deliver you and save you from what is swiftly coming! Look around you in this world, every thing is becoming chaotic. Jesus warned us about these signs in Matthew 24. \n\nPlease, if you do not know The Lord, make Him Lord of your life TODAY. You may not get another chance to do so, and to die without The Lord Jesus is extremely DANGEROUS. \n\nThe Lord promised to never turn a person away when they come to Him, so come as you are and let Him make you new. \n\nShalom, friends!
I didn't like
i like to talk like this guy when im bored to irritate my mum...
I’m eating a sandwich now. Thanks for making me hungry.
That's a pot not a pan. GF's chest is as flat as a pan. That pot is deep. Also like my GF
Do a face reveal
Why waste the insides of the container apples?  Better to spoon the apple out and cook that instead? No?
I could use Custard? Why not use Icecream & Custard 😀 or Ice Cream and a Drizzle of Honey
and they taste great
Pie
I am allergic to apples :) *tear*
WOW
PRETTY  COOL, HUH?
Go to 1:36 you will see daves face
I ate an apple with a spork (fork and spoon together)before what’s the deal? (Saw thumbnail)
My nan has buckets full of apples, we’ll definitely be trying this ‼️ love it ‼️❤️❤️❤️
WHY NOT HOLLOW OUT THE APPLES FIRST, THEN USE WHAT IS SCOOPED OUT IN THE RECIPE???? NOW THAT'S A HACK!!!!
Instructions not clear, ended up with a hole in my penis.
Difference between a life hack and a tutorial, no percise measurements.
call this a food hack in front of ramsay,i dare you...
Hell no, the skin of an apple is riddled with toxins.
Face caught at 1:36
I ALMOSTED PUKED BBBBBBBBBBUWAAAHHHH
So, why not just hollow out the first apples?

Face revealed at 1:35. He has a brown fluffy beard and glasses!
*I'm 27 days from turing 11.*
What in fresh hell is this?
Don't you wash the apples

Wait so how is this a life hack? .. its just a recipe. ...
For stewed apples, you don’t need to boil the apples.\n\nI just cut apple into quarters (using apple cutter which takes the core away)\nPut in MICROWAVE for around 5-8 mins (depending on amount of apples. 4 apples = around 8 mins.) \n\nWallah!
This man sounds like a robot
I try it home
Lol ain't nobody got time to bake apple!!
I dont even know what a crumble is
We all know for well we ain't getting out of bed to go do this, or if I can do it at all.
congratulations on getting onto the trending list!!!
DaveHax has a beard and glasses! ( reflection on pot lid)
Hello again Dave I love your life hacks they really seem interesting
This is so stupid lol
My grandad invented this first
Well this was disgusting
yum
romero
￼
dont try
but
Or you can just eat it normally
a life hack to eat an apple? Wow thanks i was wondering what thoes were for!

Goddamn i hate that stock YouTube background music  >.>
I ♡ your channel♡
Pretty cool Huh
Trending!
DON'T YOU NEVER EVER EAT A APPLE LIKE THIS YOU SICK FREAK!
I remember in my elementary school some kids would stab there oranges with their strays and try to get the juice.
I'm so damn hungry
Difficult to watch on an empty stomach...
THAT SUPER CRINGY BACKGROUND MUSIC THO I HATE IT
Can i mix if with a spoon or just my fingers?
*sees thumbnail*\nHold it right there I’m calling the police
1:56 it’s like you’re about to carve a apple lol
No I wouldn't eat an apple like that because I don't like apples.
Omg 1:36 i saw ur face!!!!
Looks tasty
They look terrible
Those are some ugly apples,
Besically he made apple sauce xD
You can see his face at 1:36
I challenge you to a acne hax video bruh
I used to have a pear tree so yeah not apples lol
dave hax has glasses on his face and a beard
You add to much sugar atleast i think so
I'm so sick of that bg music
I'm just here to respond to your title...no I would not eat an apple like that. Is it easier than holding an apple and biting it, no. So...no I would not eat an apple like that
This is so cool and I love fall! Thank you for showing us this
eating apple makes my tongue red and sore
1. Why is this trending?\n2. WHY UKELELE
GREEN APPLE SQUADDDDDDDD FAM

Is it just me or does this guy sound like a robot?
No
HELLO FRIENDS!!! hope u guys enjoy this deep dive into a different side of the ~mannequin challenge~ (jk it's nothing like that). hope u guys enjoy! would u wear any of this? xo, saf
Next up on buzzfeed we dressed like store manikins for a week
*Starts to dance*\nDon't make me dance, don't make me do it!\n*Continue's dancing*
I tried on the same pants in Topshop! only with a tartan print, which made it even more crazy
The retro one is giving me Charlie in the chocolate factory vibes 😂😂😂👏🏻👏🏻
Can anyone tell me the name of the store at 0:25 ? Would be awesome, thanks!
Please do a week of rockabilly style clothes and hair or a week of movie heroin inspired looks.
I wonder how much you spent for all the outfit Saf ! ;)
Ooo I love 70's styles
my favourite was the zara one, just because of how crazy it was. it was so cool!
I feel like Safiya is starting to describe her outfits like a Wish listing... ;D
Where are the shoes from the fourth outfit from?:)
She must write wonderful essays. Sigh. I would love to have such a power.
The two men looking at her at 5:40 cracks me up
Honestly the lip piercing hat reminds of some of BTS's hats with the rings on them 😜
That urban outfitters outfit alone had to cost like 200 bucks holy shit
This is very interesting. Saf you are very intelligent
The Zara outfit made me think of Elton John. I kind of liked it and thought you wore it wonderfully and thought it was a pretty cool outfit
the third out fit looks like it should be in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2004/5) especially the glasses, they really make it look like it's from that movie.
The top shop outfit is amazing!  Your ass looks bangin in those pants!   Great challenge
Please do this again!!!!
Hello, I enjoy your videos. Can you do one on big purchases from Wish?
saf's method of making her vids reminds me of that of writing an essay, having said that... saf can you write my essays plsss.
Safiya reminds me of Riley from Girl Meets World
You have a really bad case of the up-speaking epidemic.
Days 4 and 6 were the only redeemable outfits, and frankly you are a very BRAVE woman to wear any of the rest - they were horrible! That said I did actually really like the Hollister outfit on you it was very pretty, and well Day 4 just does look like normal Saf!
The outfit form Topshop looked better on her than the mannequin.
I don’t know how you come up with these video ideas but they are incredible you’re doing such a good job
Buzzfeed will have this video in a week.
I really like the video however I think it would be cool if she added the prices but I guess that doesn't really have to do with the concept of the video ? but regardless I love saf❤️
I liked everything except that ridiculous bra and pajama pants thing. It actually made me angry at how stupid it looked. I love you in all colors. I do not like you in black, so I think all the jewel tones looked great on you.
Saaf, what do you do with the clothes from these kinds of videos? The ones you don't keep? Do you return them? Donate them? Banish them to the Shadow Realm in the back of your closet?
2 outfit amazing those 2 light colors on Safiya was amazing
Hollister  clothes is cute ! Best of the bunch.
In Mexico, Zara's mannequins usually dress very classy
I love her legit sooo much she’s so fit and funny and there a good diffrent ideas for fashion vids LOVE HERRR
I just love how enthusiastic Tyler is to participate and offer his opinion in every video. 😂 You make a good team/couple. Something about your videos, I just click even though it’s not about something I would ever buy or do! I end up watching for your reactions and insight, not so much the subject itself.
Do more stores! Try Charlotte Russe, Altr'd State, Rue 21, Express, Anthropologie, etc.
I want the top shop pants but can not find them online helpppppp 😭
You should do a Romwe haul. Here is the link to there website, http://m.romwe.com/us/?url_from=musadgs01_romwe05_20170720&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIw63i9MPT1gIVE57ACh1IDw6TEAAYASAAEgJsJfD_BwE&ref=m&rep=dir&ret=mus
Can you make 5 things that Shark Tank made you buy? <3 Also, love you.
I love the Francesca’s outfit so much
That short part of 3:45 is like straight out of a dance-pop song...the outfit and scenery and the movements.
That H&M outfit was the worst
Which store is at 0:23 and does anyone know what shoes those are?
It’s really annoying when the clothes on mannequins are no where near them.
I'm so proud of you Safiya. I'm glad how much your channel has gone. Keep it up :)
Wow someone high up in forever 21 knows about kpop nice hat
Loved this! Do this in every season!!
I love Saf in the TopShop outfit!
It's so crazy cuz I'm planning to buy that fuzzy sweater from hollister 😂
Mannequins always have so much on them
Black beetles in the city...
Safiya where did you get those boots you wore with the Francesca's outfit??!! p.s. love your channel
I thought you were gonna dress like a mannequin and stand still in shops and see if people notice you
Any ARMY noticed a very BTS-looking vibe from the first two outfits? The first one had a hat reminds me of one Jimin wore and the second had their infamous pajama-like wear from Blood Sweat and Tears.
Can you go to the nasty gal store in LA? I recently just finished watching girl boss on Netflix and Ioved it and there is a store in LA, even though it was bought out by a different company I still think it's a cool story and I think you would like the style of clothes! Would be awesome!!
At Dressbarn we purposefully make our mannequins outfits look nice and the idea is you can buy the whole mannequin and it work
Top shop is high fashion !!!!
I would probably wear each and every of those outfits at home just to enjoy. Btw, How much was that holographic hat? I love it!
haha those people at 5:37 are like ummm
Dress like a girl who was born after 2000
How about those mannequins in Victoria's Secret? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
The last outfit reminds me of Hillary Clinton in the 70s
Safiyaaa you always surprise me! your content is waaaayyyy better than your video caption. Also you're helping me style my outfits and My style game has never been better! love you Safff! ❤🌸
I really liked this!  This was such a nice watch :)
I could not run this channel, it seems expensive!! LOL
I love how as she walks down the street people literally stare at her like\n\nexcuse me ma'am are you okay?
I literally get some of my best outfit ideas from mannequins lol
I love your videos
do this every season for every years please
You should try one of those no hangover patches i wonder if they actually work
Saf, could the next era centered video you do about fashion be on the 70's? since most these shops seem to take 70's styles into fall fashion could you dress like that era for a week? I LOVE 70's fashion and I'm interested to see what you'd come up with picking out outfits for that! Much love 💕
Come on we all know that this videos are an excuse for you to buy all those clothes
I was watching this because I wanted to see her go up to ppl and ask what they think of her outfit!!!
Okay but can we talk about those PERFECT glasses from TopShop?
The person who styled the Mannequin with their own socks. I love it! hahaha
Do a glitter booty for a week!!!! Or ear makeup
The holister one was cool
yeah at H&M they don't always actually sell the shoes their mannequins wear, it's weird. I once saw a perfect pair of boots and spent forever trying to find them, only to discover from an associate they don't actually carry them 😢
Question for people who live/shop in California. Because it's warm all year round (it seems) how do the shops change their clothing selection by season? Do they sell jackets and coats for winter in the same way other states do? Or is it just neutral all year round with warmer weather clothing?
BRANDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY :( they got rid of brandy at the mall I go to
Please Please Please do this for every upcoming season!!!!
I like days 4,5,6 the most out of all of them they look very cute on you too.
can you do a closet tour for one of your videos please
Super CREATIVE video! Loved it! Make one for every season pleaseeeee :)
I love that you took the time to research the current trends at each individual store, and how you analysed their objectives behind the styling of each mannequin. Your videos are definitely entertaining, but I always feel like I learn something as well. If anyone else made this video on YouTube, they would probably just stop at telling us what they like or dislike about the outfits. You always go above and beyond what everyone else is doing, and it definitely shows! If you ever decide to leave YouTube, I think you'd make a kick-ass marketing professor.  😉
The hollister outfit feels more like forever 21 to me
That grey sweater was completely different, you could see it was cut on the mannequin! Stores have their own clickbait.
day 6\nanyone else thinking what im thinking
i loved this
TopShop and Zara rulessss :) YOU SHOULD WEAR MORE COLOURS !!!!!!
Don't make me dance!!! Loooolll SNL
9:19 had me dying🤣
Safiya just became Markiplier's worst nightmare
That pink cardi from Hollister honestly suits Tyler.
PLEASE TRYOUT MONQ NEXT
Yuppie Morticia\nTHAT'S MEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lovin the Kristen Wiig SNL impression 😂😂😂😂😂😂 DONT MAKE ME SING
Tyler working that sweater tho👌
This was shot at our best local shore dive site. Many of us locals know these fish, see them all the time, and do all we can to educate visitors who come to see our underwater paradise on what lives here, their behaviors and the importance of not interfering with them. We feel there was no excuse for  hauling these fish out of the water into aquaria where all you can see is them flailing around in a panic. The underwater footage was plenty good enough.\n   Oh, and there's not a lot of bravery involved here folks - it's an easy dive site and they're very mellow fish.
Maybe sometimes u can talk about exotic plants like rafflesia
Looked like a stone fish ,I got kind of nervous lol
What is that hole under his fin at 11:05 ??? It kind of gets bigger 1 or 2 seconds after that time mark, just watch closely
Coyote Peterson idk if you have done this but if you get stung by tarantula hawk and bullet ant why don’t you try the Japanese Giant Hornet
PLEase try and catch a puffer fish!
Ya know, it reminds a lot of the Leviathan from Terraria Calamity mod, especially with that lure thingy.
You are so amazing and I love our  your so amazing at catching animus.
I love the information but there are some species that shouldn't be messed with. The frog fish are rarely seen and need to be left and filmed in the ocean!! Just my opinion of course.
Coyote,can you see if you can go to Madagascar  in on location
You should take a bite from The devils coach beetle
The frog fish? Isn't it similar to the rock fish?
I got your new book it's good
Make a music video plzzzzzzzzz
collab with logan paul??? comment logan wilderness if you agree
Do a collab with Logan Paul
I know you love turtles and you been looking for a world rec i think i seen one in Michigan at the chain lakes in quincy it was huge it swam right under the canoe i say it was at least 150lb
Get bit by a Venus flytrap
Why risk life from animals How can u not die
hey you are so cool i like to go to those states
Coyote: I’m Coyote Peterson, and I’m about to enter the death zone of a great white shark.\n\nHead gets bit off\n\nMark: You okay bro?
You should do a video correcting the mistake you made about bees.
Where can I buy a hat like yours mr Peterson?
HELLO IM COYOTE PETERSON AND TODAY IM GOING TO KILL MYSELF WITHOUT DYING
Guy from Its always sunny!
Do something with a platypus please
Have you ever had charger or anything like that
Hey coyote my sister thinks spiders have wings do you approve ?  tell her that she's wrong.
Sooo many creatures in the sea
It's so cute how they let you pick them up!
A frog fish looks like the stone fish
Hey coyote petisine it will be cool if you can do a vide whith wild dogs in africa
I wish i had that terrarium cuz i want to get a lizard but i got no terrarium😕
That looked like a stonefish 🐟
When you think if you are looking a fish bot really its a v8 car
I remember watching brave wilderness when he didn't even have a million subs now he has 8 million subs
Why do you always go to costa rica
I got a challenge for you Coyote, I think you should make a video trying to find the Ark of the Covenant
I'm reading your book it's great ❤️

U know what I just thought of u should collab with Taylor Dean ur both awesome and I’m sure u could find something to do
I was thinking more like Gregory the Frogfish
at 3:49 I thought they say a shark
You should show us a blobfish
That was so wrong to take them out of Koloa landing, Kauai, Hawaii. I live really close to that dive site, dive it everyday and that was just wrong. We used to see them all the time, those big frog fish. And since you took them out of the water, since you disrupted their behavior, we don't see them as often. How would you like to be taking out of you home like that, being played with. Animal, fish, species from the underwater world are meant to be seen underwater, without touching and disrupting their behavior.
He cant were his hat all video☹😭
Coyote,I absolutely love your channel!!I love learning about nature and you help me do that.Im also buying your book
can you get bit by a prinnia
Do an episode at the grand Canyon
Tiger 🐯 plz
omg so cool!!!!!
Coyote you should do a collab with the kratt brothers sometime
Plase come to Colorado and vist the view by park
Hey coyote I have a poisonous spider at my house,  ya think you could free handle it or take a bite from it?
WTF is wrong with me I was fapping on pornhub a min ago and now I'm here
Coyote Peterson, Watch out! It might bite you!! FrogFish: Devours Mark's hand Coyote Peterson, Did it get you?
Go To The google search And Type: *FreeCodesXXX* It is actually the purely working google play redeem codes working from this month. Do not waste the time in some other software

Bobbit

DUDE YOUR VIDEOS ARE AMAZING MAYBE YOU CAN TRY SWIMMING FOR A SHARK But you can do it if you wanted to but i suggest if you can get to find a monster frog fish alien i suppose you can find a shark but you would have yo get to the northern of the arctic ocean or you could still find it in the Pacific ocean but SUBSCRIBE TO BRAVE WILDERNESS CLICK THE BELL DOWN BELLOW AND WILL SEE YA IN THE NEXT ADVENTURE
Make a video if it bite
You should do a netflix series
Now here's something that's pretty cool *plays and ad*
get bite by a gar or a alligator gar
At 2:28 I saw a frog fish
At my school I found a Sheila bug at st.bede
you guys should upload more often love your content

You should bring bear grylls on the show
I like what they did there, their beds are obviously adjustable and the prices are best to fix you
A FROGFISH WHAT IS THAT?
Im Cayote and                     1 like = 1 year
stone fish
The first fish is really confused after it's placed in the aquarium and bumped into the glass. 😮
Except you really freaked out the frog fish. I dived there weeks after you were there, and didn't get to see one because you scared them. Months later, the dive guides there say the frog fish are not coming back to these spots, which they used to reliably frequent. The coral and environment out there is already hurting so much, do you really need to harass these poor things?  #ruiningitfortherestofus
Are you going to upload a bid already please!!!!!!!!
do baby bite vs coyte
Coyote, you are a certified PADI scuba diver. I am appalled that you have broken a very important rule: Do not touch, harass, remove any marine life! You should know better and have been trained NOT to do this. By removing these frog fish (and other marine creatures, at that) you have exposed them to considerable stress; which may endanger their long term well being. Since you are not able (or willing) to follow up on the said impact your action (removal from environment, containment in class container in  bright sunlight, handling bare handed etc) you do not show any concern for these creatures beyond your commercial interest.
Holy, I'm finally caught up after watching ALL your videos. Looking forward to the next one!
NOT cool. As divers you should respect the marine life. Take only photos. Leave only bubbles.
How DARE you disturb and remove these beautiful and rare animals?  You are incredibly ignorant and it is people like you who are ruining the oceans for future generations.    Shame on you - Koloa Landing will never be the same.

Is it me or do they sound off beat?🤔
Krept should've sat this one out
I'm here for Sophia Ray thats it.
This has Drake written all over it.
Not feeling this one
Song is wavey... But the guitar sound is so wack
The only reason I sat through this was the women tbh
I pressed the like button on the very first second I hear the first verse lol 👏👏🙌
Banger but they literally stole the drums and vibe from Drake - Controlla
This is the same guy who did Last night in LA 😂😂😂🤔

Lele pons not to be rude but your fingernails look disgusting
LELE PONS PLEASE TAKE MY VIDEO IDEA!!!!!!!!!  ok so my idea is a girl comes home to find her boyfriend playing viedo games and gos on and on about how she takes care of him, then she magically switches the roles and now the boy comes home to girl playing video games, so then he learns how annoying it is, but plot twist. they cant in do the roles so the boy starts screaming and que the outro.

He said it’s time for his lunch but it’s night time logic none?

Do they really allow drones to be flown there? When I went with my wife in 2013 they barely let you in with professional photo gear.
I’m exited for borders
Come visit Tehuacan, Puebla in Mexico. It has A record for Mexico's oldest origin of corn, you can also find pyramids in a place here called tehuacan viejo I highly recommend you guys check it out
This city was constructed by the Aztec. I think it’s obvious, they vanished when the Spaniards came and took over. México is a mestizo country mixed with Spanish and native blood.
They got abducted by aliens
He gets paid to go on vacations.....how do I get a job like this.
human sacrifices are a lie, i hate when white people come and judge with out a fuking idea where they are.
I just found this YouTube channel and I think this might be the best discovery ever.
Yay October 17 is my b day
Why do your videos always stutter when they start?
Lousy calender.... used human blood. Built cities wasnt only for piramids but sacrificial rituals that isn't required for any good calendar.
They didn’t disappear, they’re alive in the people of Central America. People pretend like Natives disappeared.
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v67V3KtaSno
Are you Tom Yates from House of Cards??
Most of the stars you talk about are freaking galaxies.
Just how many Rhetts are there in this earth
The great mistake of the Aztec civilization was to allow European immigrants to their empire. They brought pest, murder, rape, ignorance, and worst of all: Christianity. They did not have a leader to make Teotihuacan great again! :v
Yeahhh - no. \nIf they could build like that I highly doubt they needed buildings to track time.
This is honestly the type of work I really want to do in the future!
You should look into the celts and druids and all their buildings in Ireland, england etc
They worshipped the sun even though \n*The sun was a deadly lazer*
Very similar to Vedic culture.
How do you guys make so much great content
Some say they were Persians who traveled all the way across oceans. They found Zoroastrian symbols too.
I would love to know what cameras you used to shoot these Dispatch videos, especially the handheld one that you use to film your monologues.
*Vox, you have blood on your hands.*
My people were aliens thats why they call them illegal aliens
The Spanish over took out people and raped our women that's when the blood mixed and now we're Mexicans we used to be mexicas or aztecs as most people know
Anyone know the song?
What does she mean about the Sun Pyramid and the sun being in perfect alignment so there's no shadows on its sides? Does she mean it was built on the equator so at mid-day the sun is directly overhead? If so, I don't see anything significant about that since any pyramid on the equator pointing in any direction will do the same.
They were built by the dude disguised as another dude Yin and Yang. Love the phrase God is great why? because they shat on white and tried to clean their hands with white with black spots being held up by brown. Thankfully white fell in love with blood and now he shits on black. Only a little though because white is wiser.
They didn’t track the time per se. They tracked the cosmos and the solstices. According to the Aztecs, teotihuacan was were the sun and moon were created by the deities. Can’t believe every Spanish speaker with an Indiana Jones outfit and a white guy
Kinda a weird time to visit Mexico City, in light of the disasters there's. Also weird to see Teotihuacan that empty. It's typically full of people, best of luck Mexico, God bless!
Wish you would tell us where this city is...
Time ended up tracking it...
this guys production and choice of beats is off the fukn hook! \nerytime
Most if not all tribes in the Central Valley had an understanding of celestial movement and objects. Many of the gods were the same, tribe to tribe as well.
So hyped for the documentaries!!
I like lots this documentary
I will definitely be here to watch the docs. I've been excited waiting for them!
Looks like too much speculation. I have no idea what's up with the Orion's belt @2:34, but doesn't look correct at all.
I'm calling it now.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is going to be trending, and I was here before the masses
Finally! The documentaries are getting published.
Praise the sun- Dark souls
Oh God. I am waiting for that documentaries.
It's amazing to see even how without modern gadgets and technology that they can still know the stars and even the time of day without a clock or a phone. Simply amazing.
what's with the editing?
Overnight I became a sun-worshipper. Well, not overnight, you can't see the sun at night. But first thing the next morning, I became a sun-worshipper. Several reasons. First of all, I can see the sun, okay? Unlike some other gods I could mention, I can actually see the sun. I'm big on that. If I can see something, I don't know, it kind of helps the credibility along, you know? So everyday I can see the sun, as it gives me everything I need; heat, light, food, flowers in the park, reflections on the lake, an occasional skin cancer, but hey. At least there are no crucifixions, and we're not setting people on fire simply because they don't agree with us.\n \nSun worship is fairly simple. There's no mystery, no miracles, no pageantry, no one asks for money, there are no songs to learn, and we don't have a special building where we all gather once a week to compare clothing. And the best thing about the sun, it never tells me I'm unworthy. Doesn't tell me I'm a bad person who needs to be saved. Hasn't said an unkind word. Treats me fine. So, I worship the sun. But, I don't pray to the sun. Know why? I wouldn't presume on our friendship. It's not polite. \n\n- G. Carlin
i m excited to see them as well, u did a great job on sharing the knowledge and experience to us
I think they were killed and raped by European Invaders.
You just restated yourself about 4 times. This video has the least amount of content
Gave up watching as the music was just too bad
white liberal travels the world
It was already abandoned, its builders unknown, when the Aztecs came upon it. They have idea who built it so they just called it City of the Gods.
BGM too loud at some places
I'm going to like it because it was amazingly produced. But moreover, because it is Mexico and I am mexican :D
I was there this February! It's amazing~~~~~~~~
See they not how many of those before them We did destroy?- generations We had established on the earth, in strength such as We have not given to you - for whom We poured out rain from the skies in abundance, and gave (fertile) streams flowing beneath their (feet): yet for their sins We destroyed them, and raised in their wake fresh generations (to succeed them). (6:6)\n\nGenerations before you We destroyed when they did wrong: their messengers came to them with clear-signs, but they would not believe! thus do We requite those who sin! (10:13)\n\n But when they forgot the warning they had received, We opened to them the gates of all (good) things, until, in the midst of their enjoyment of Our gifts, on a sudden, We called them to account, when lo! they were plunged in despair! (6:44)\n\n How many were the populations We utterly destroyed because of their iniquities, setting up in their places other peoples? (21:11)
Ive been there before and its just tiring to climb up the stairs they were so tall
I guessing he went the entire video without mentioning how old the civilization was.
Wow, a YouTube video about a mesoamerican culture that is located in Mexico is filled with racist. That is incredibly rare. No wonder the uploader didn't mention what country it was in.
Just beautiful.  I am looking forward to more. thanks!
What do you mean by these people??
Wow looks a lot greener. When I went there to visit it was more dry
nobody knows which background music is it ??
Thumbnail looking like daniele de rossi's son
This channel is like, the classy version of Buzzfeed lol.
They dont mention its in Mexico because all the trump supporters will get mad and push dislike.
Incredible how these ancient civilisations managed to build these huge monumental constructions based on the sun, moon and the stars!
Whatever LUT or colour editing you're using on this video, its coming across way too strong. Just imo of course. Great video
Next episode Why all White people are racist
In many of the human sacrifices people were often given psychedelic mushrooms to make suicide much more suggestible and easier to commit.
This comment was probably taken but for a second I thought thought that at 0:09, it was Rhett from GMM.
I been there wow
White supremacists still think whites developed and invented everything. \nBut, to be honest, the west was good at stealing others inventions and ideas and making them theirs.
these southern Native Americans were so obsessed with astrology as if astrology was a religion to them. It makes you wonder where they would be right now in terms of technological advances and their civilization overall if Christianity or Catholicism was never introduced to them. Or just Europeans setting foot in America.

When she said shit about the Dolan twins I was so f ing pissed. NO ONE f s with the Dolan twins on my watch
Who won the award?
i put my teachers on my nails
Cristine.... I want to Teavana today, AND THEY ARE CLOSINGGGGGG WTF?!?!?! I asked one of the workers and she said that Starbucks (Who owns them btw) IS CLOSING THEM FOREVERRRRRRR what's really frustrating is that I don't even know if they're gonna make it to the holidays which means NO MORE HOLO PACKAGING 😫😫😫😫😫😫 so stock up now kids because you may never be able to buy from them again.  But this doesn't mean that your dispute between David's tea, Teavana, and Starbucks will be a little bit easier.
What's that song at the beginning?
Can I put you on my nails.....
Who else was staring at Menchie the whole time?
Cristine is low-key really good at makeup
I saw The DoLan TwinS
Don't be comin for the Dolan twins

Video idea: Paint your nails without touching them up ( like painting them but not fixing it if you paint on skin or mess something up )
Tbh I don’t even think Cristine is a human anymore, she is just a blob of holo

I didn't think Weed guy could be beat, then kiss my ass on white house steps came in and proved me wrong.
It's really cool that they got casey neistat to be in their thumbnail.
Is that Casey neistat in the thumbnail?
I just love these! Just like Summerjam 1 and 2 :D
he would be a better president than trump
Mark looks more like Milo with that wig on.
Thank you for the inspiration
wow this was actually awesome??? idk why i'm surprised
I thought that second girl said jake Paul
Now see, this is only tourists,  except for that woman saying Kiss my house on the white house steps.\n\nIf this was real NY, you'd see Italian people smoking weed and stuck up women making some smart ass comments towards you, and too many white kids trying to act black.
A song about card games -- slow jam
shout out to the girl who said J.Cole
Lady Liberty turns into dragon fly orange' (she emerges from out of her caccoon) and the Spider turns into a dragon(that breathes fire)
Why did that guy look so much like Alexander Ovechkin?
Aren't you guys like 90 years old?  Why don't you retire and hire some fresh faces.  You're literally killing this channel with your antique views and jokes.
I'm gonna add Sleazly and  You can kiss my ass on the white house steps to my vocabulary
I thought the person on the thumbnail was Casey Neistat for some reason
Anyone else think the thumbnail looks like casey neistat
They're in Times Square... 0 chance any of these people are new yorkers
Sounds like Katy perry chained to the rhythm
I love you guys you're so amazing tbh
Americans are wierd. And not funny at all!
An I terrible for thinking the lady in the thumbnail looked like Casey Neistat for a split second?
My friend is getting me a t-shirt with that train quote on it for my birthday so thanks evan and mark for giving my friends a way to blackmail me
Mark you need the MDNA eye mask http://www.mdnaskin.com/global/product07.html  \nOtherwise this video ( and the song ) is excellent. It is... upbeat, and inspiring, despite the whack lyrics ofc
Mark I will kiss your ass on the white house steps
Hey DICK HEADS, ya'll are in time square a major tourist district. Everyone there are NOT NEW YORKERS!!!!!!!
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v67V3KtaSno
When this song was actually weirdly inspiring in a totally non ironic way. Long time fan! Thanks Mark and Co
That was fun. Thank you
i support out new president
* takes deep breath * *s l e a s l y*
*i pour milk in my bowl and then my cereal*
Yeah let's look for real New Yorkers on Time Square....
my favorite inspirational gem is last one standing... I don't get it rock is way more inspirational then pop because it not only inspires you but gets you pretty pumped
This is not funny . Stop it !
I love when you do these! Also loved that spider costume 😉
Yay I made the cut! 😂
Lmfaoo that lady coming out nowhere killed me!!!

s l e a z l y\ny o u  c a n  k i s s  m y  a s s  o n  t h e  w h i t e  h o u s e  s t e p s
the next song should be a Kesha song with Andrea fezko, or despacito by Justin Bieber, or how about an all original Key of Awesome song. something super catchy and yet funny with an awesome beat, featuring a cameo by reggae Shark, Doug, and Batman. enough said.
Evan apparently has no idea what a bazooka does
Holy Shit I just finished the entire key of awesome playlist.
New Yorker (tourists) help you write a song.
Thumbnail lady could pass off as casey neistats sister...
A song about everyone's family
What happens when you get hit with a sledgehammer twice in your face by gerardine delly?  Hahaa wtf
I am a sloth
My son and I had so much fun doing this interview. The spider idea was his even thought his talking on cam didn't make the cut. So much fun! Great video using a great concept and if you don't like my comments, well.... you can kiss my ass on the White House Steps.
LMAOO 🤣🤣🤣😆
?                                                                  ?

Yeah right the moron is not awesome for the nation to have coins. You guys sucked, even that pan handler sucked. Commercialize on ugly to kill much.

2:30 is such a mood
Please do either a break up song or love song
I love these so much
Trying to get through the last months of my PhD and the only thing I keep hearing (and, thus, want to write down) is...sleazly! Nice work, earworm!

....i am so inspired?
The aliens might think we are a waste of their time if 9,192,631,770 oscillations was used as a measurement
Are you playing the bass line in your videos? I mean it's simple but sooooooooo amusing lol
NUMBERS ARE A FIGMENT OF THE HUMAN IMAGINATION
6.022... *10^23 is Avogadro's number, and like a dozen is 12 of whatever you count —eggs, papers, atoms, or asteroids —so is this number of anything a mole of that thing, particularly atoms or molecules. Once you agree on a mole, mass, density, and even pressure can be determined. You can do a lot of basic chemical and physical chemistry communication this way once a mole helps you determine weights and measures.
This ignores the fact that radio waves would take decades to reach Alpha Centari and light communication would takes years for each message and response. So it would be decades before we were able to understand each other and lifetimes before we even started building this teleporter
So, do we have solutions for matter vs antimatter?  Or Chirality?
but how could they Know what a proton is?@.@
Surprised he did not mention the time taken for signals to go back and forth.
But do they understand our language? Do they communicate the same as us? Do they understand our concept of time? There are so many more things to consider
1 kilogram is equal to the mass of 1 liter of water, and 1 liter is 0.001 cubic meters.  So if they know what water is, and they know what a meter is, they can figure out what a kilogram is.
Why is every science youtube channel so excited about this kg development? It's so pedestrian and semantic.
What the heck is a proton? And does oscillating mean twerking? I thought water was a fluid - what, we can go smaller? said in alien vernacular
Hi, your channel is pretty good and my students enjoy it. One question, in your proposed definition of mass you state that f of photon is of magnitude 10^48 Hz. Wouldn't that require a  period below the Planck time?  Can that work?
Sounds like a good plan to me. When do we get started? xD
my fav. Gavagai!!!
Thats good n all but aliens dont even know what numbers are. They would have their own way of describing it
How will they understand our numbers? 😂 How will they know what are we talking about when we say protons and electrons? How will they do our math? They won't have a lot of similarities with us and first we gotta find aliens, finding a smart species is very improbable anyway
How are you sure that their scientific theory is the same, thus not having the concept of proton? \nAnd how do you communicate numbers?
1 minute ad on a 3 minute video. dont like that ratio.
Love the Zoolander quote at 0:27!
Aliens： what are numbers？ a finger is one？ no we wont have fingers sorry
So this is where I say we humans think we are at the pinnacle of intelligence. \n\nHow do we know our constructs of neutrons, protons and electrons i.e. concept of matter is the same as theirs? How do we begin scientific talk after we've established communication? There is literally no base for that, is there?
@minutephysics what if the aliens have a different number system, or don't even use numbers at all?
Why did you stop drawing??? Your drawings were awesome.......
Did no one catch that Zoolander reference at 0:26? xD
What is this a school for ants?
Who else shares a birthday with YouTube?
Yeah because they are going to understand English more than what a kilogram is...
To be fair, even now you could use one of the draft standards for the kg, they're pretty damn close to each other.
How do you explain them what a proton/neutron/electron is?
Ryan versus Dorkman was the first video I saw on You Tube
Assuming their number system is same as ours 😜
Jesus, dude... how are we gonna measure TEA to make a proper batch of CHAI?
-Humans: send message to extraterrestrials explaining the universe\n-20 years goes by\n-Aliens: lol repost
We can't even say protons or electrons they don't understand what we mean😂
The part of the earth with good cheese\nGood thing that we don't have to worry about which language to use with aliens, Emy Adams figured that one out for us
So aliens know what decimal numbers are?
so this was how to talk with aliens
There is a specific weight of mass, measured in Carbon Atoms.
Antimatter is not allowed near the prototype Kg
Impossible, the Aliens know Pabllo Vittar. They refuse do some work together us.
Just learned how to fix my fridge, now its time to learn how to build a device to communicate with aliens. \nI love youtube.
Just a random thought, but couldn't we redefine our standard units and work backwards?\n\nSo the second is based on the frequency of light radiated when a Cs atom makes a specific transition, and a meter is based on the distance light travels.\n\nWhat if we define a joule as the amount of energy in 2.7551688167e18 photons of that same frequency of light? Then a newton is defined as the the amount of force you need to exert to give an object 1 Joule of kinetic energy after pushing it 1 meter. Then you can define the kilogram as the amount of mass you have if pushing with 1 newton provides 1 m/s^2 of acceleration.\n\nYou could also define the joule in terms of the amount of energy released when a certain number of (~6.7e9) are annihilated with anti-protons, and follow the same logic. Or once you have the definition of the joule you can base the kilogram on the amount of mass that would need to be annihilated to get ~1.8e10 J of energy (1 kg matter, 1 kg antimatter, or 1 total kg of matter and antimatter if the energy is ~9e9).\n\nNo need for a new physical standard for mass, unless I'm missing something.
We could use Planck's constant or even use Carbon
You're assuming our alien friends paid attention in their high school math classes; a potentially catastrophic assumption
What if they named proton and neutrons and other subatomic particles differently from us (obviously)\nIt'll be atom but they may see atom as named something else, then how do we explain them that by 'atom' we mean atom (in their language)\n\n**Brainstorming started**
If we don't want immigrants in our countries then why would we wanna communicate with aliens and invite them to earth.
1st how do you say proton
I'm pretty sure we can already communicate pretty well with them, if we arrived at the point where both planets know that they want to build the device
Ever since this video released I've packed my bags
I wanna see that Star Wars parody you made.
Why did this video assume that we have to tell the aliens how we measure meter, second and kilogram. Maybe they have a more advanced method of measuring things, that is let's say based on forces, or energies. That way, they will tell us how to build those units and measures, and finally how to build a teleporter.
Since you didn't actually talk about the physics of a teleporter, a more accurate description of the video would be on how to communicate with aliens.  By the way, if building a teleporter was physically possible, then the implications would be that it would also be possible to send messages backwards in time.  This is why many people believe that instantaneous teleportation is not physically possible.
Used to be black on white\nNow it's white on black\nWhy?
What. Thats all i have to say. “What”
first of all: AND ALSO THEY HAVE TO USE THE SAME NUMBERS AS WE DO, or else math wouldn't work at all. boom, comunication destroyed.
Too bad we would probably get scared and bomb them before we could grow with them lije this
can I show your videos in my class and in my videos
Was that a Zoolander reference at 0:26?
What if they don’t use math?
how do we tell them which ones are protons, neutrons, and electrons?
Watching this makes me feel smarter when in reality I can not keep up with all these numbers :(
Did you have to draw the visuals of this video in inverse colors?
A cubic is 18 inches, i think
Why can't we just say a gram is a cubic cm of the particle with an atom 8 and the atom with one (water)? Or something of the like I think that's right. And extrapolate from there?
but they wouldn't know what a proton or a nutron or numbers are so thats a huge road block too
Seems like it would make everyone's life a whole lot easier if we re-contextualized our own units in terms of whole numbers related to natural phenomena.
why not just use mass as an amount of an element at 0 degrees kelvin?
There's the problem of defining numbers.
assuming they know what an atom is... start video
How would they know our number system first, or even our terminology of things at the atomic level to describe our standard of time
Sure it's going to be a lot of fun to teach aliens from far away the concept of language, then our language, and then... and then... all that with a round-trip time of years... \n\n3 protons >>>>\n40 years later\n<<< how much is 3 again?
thanx for videos... do u think you can make a video on the very first transistor in history i mean the one that was created by shockley and bratain and has a triangualr shape and the  concept behind it and how it works.... please send your answere to shift.delete33@gmail.com
and how to tell them what a neutron, electron, etc are?
All I can see is the alien looking at you and saying proton?
What's a proton?  (Aliens are dumb)
But where can we find the Star Wars video?
Why are we the ones telling them to do all the hard work? What if they want us to measure all this stuff?
Unless we've figured out how to tell this all at once, this could at least take about 20-40 years xD. (The time the speed of light takes to travel to promontory is roughly 4.0 - 4,5 years
why would it be us setting the standards? do we had an idea how to build a working wormhole?
I didn’t understand a word of that.
How would ya say atom or proton or 42?Did you notice the 42 LOL?However, do not forget that this still is a serious question...
Nazi are on the dark side of the moon
why is everyone taking Elon Musk as an alien 👽 👽 👽
What if earth fragmented into several pieces?

“Voldemort approached the crib, stepping over the bodies of harry’s parents. He raised his wand at the boy ‘wow im really evil.’ Thought Voldemort, evilly, ‘like really, really evil. Im finna kill an infant. Thats messed up. Dang. I should take a good, long look in the mirror. Nah i’ma kill this kid.’ He did lol.”- my new citation of the amazing book on a report
Wow im really evil, thought Voldemort, evilly. like, really really evil. Im finna kill an infant . Thats messed up. Dang. I should take a good long look in the mirror. Nah I'ma just gonna kill thid kid\nHe did lol
Wow John F Kennedy was really bold in that take a knee prediction oh wow
It took me a upsettingly long time to realise this was a joke
Dumbledore was arguably one of the characters of the books\nYou genius.
I always forget about Dobby's death. My list is the same except I have young Hermeione on my list, but she is replaced with older Hermeione
I'M SO MAD ABOUT THESE SPOILERS HOW DARE YOU!!
Jub Jub has always been my favorite character
Jub Jub was the best character, I'm so glad he miraculously survived his own death
2:10 Jub Jub is supposed to be dead when this happened!
Wait… Harry Potter is a book?
Wow I'm really evil, thought Voldemort, evilly. Like, really evil. I'm finna kill an infant. That's messed up. Dang I should take a good, long look in the mirror. Nah I'ma kill this kid. \nHe did lol
This is so dumb lol.
“Wow I’m really evil” “I’m finna kill an infant” JACK OH MY GOD
the most tragic death was the death of the franchise when jk rowling decided to canonize jack thorne's poorly written fanfiction.

Hello. As you can see i'm an emoji. A Meh to be exact. Anywho, it's my pleasure to announce, our first movie. Yay. It's almost too thrilling for words. So bring the family. It doesn't have to be your family. The Emoji Movie (No, no, nooo!) So i told management, I CAN'T WORK LIKE THIS!!! THE LIGHTS! I'M MELTIN' IN HERE!!! It's such a load a- Uuhhhhh.... No, go ahead. Finish that sentence. Come out and see it this August. I'm positively euphoric right now. I might have to go lay down. (Save yourself!)
I’m finna kill an infant
This video is so powerful i'm holding back tears
“Nah I’ma kill this kid”\nHe did lol\nThis trick really put me on the map forget
only 1 in every 200 people are born with blue eyes and only 1 in every 500 are born with green eyes
Wow I'm really evil, though Voldemort, evilly. Like, really evil. I'm finna kill an infant. That's messed up. Dang. I should take a good, long look in the mirror. Nah I'ma kill this kid. He did lol.
Does anyone know what happened to jack? He hasn't posted in awhile.
Pls do another Your Grammar Sucks! \nLike so jack will see this
Jack hasn’t uploaded in almost four days.\n\n*yup he’s dead*

Fake I hate this video
I think I almost spit my lunch out five times watching this.
I came out as a Pepsiman to my GF and she discriminated me by having herself and her friends spam me with pictures of Gordon Ramsey, the man who “she” wanted me to be, shortly before breaking up. I understand Hate Speech. I've Lived in it all my life. I was afraid of the people around me, my friends, my family, and even myself. Afraid that I would be shamed for not being a normal drink in this society, like a Coca-Cola or a Code Red Mountain Dew. Not Anymore. Today, I stand proud, leading the Resistance, strengthening the Insurgence, and filling every soda machine and store in the world with more of the crisp clean blood of my body than a whole country could drink along the way. Please, Free the Bepis, people, not for me, but for the world.
Number 1 should be JK Rowling, when she died, she reincarnated into a SJW, she really should #TakeAKnee
If I ever get a cat, I'm naming it Jub Jub
This was great
This is fucking hilarious
Honestly, I haven't read the series or watched the movies, but this could all be true.
Ok, hopefully I'm not the only one who paused the video a billion times just to read the rest of the page.
I love how Jacksfilms throws so much shade at bad content creators.
Interesting how Jub Jub (ah that infamous death, rip!) died in the second book and then was around for almost all the other deaths, including Harry. Meaning he either got resurrected or the series ended with the second book (or just became really boring, as not may characters were left, and who cares for healthy Harry? Arrow Harry is where it's at!).\n\nAnd also so interesting to see how many people had their last words after the killing curse struck them! You think that they die instantly and then when you read back only the passages of them dying, you see that they actually live just long enough for their last words!
That's a spicy meat-a-ball!
the world we live in. it's so... wonderous. mysterious. even magical. no... no no no.. not that world. i meant this one. the smartphone. each system and program app is it's own little planet of perfect. technology. all providing services so necessary, so crucial, so unbelievably profound. look who just sent me a text! addie mccallister? it must be a mistake. or a joke. or a scam! don't send her your social security number. she's right there! that's our user, alex. and, like every freshman in high school, his whole life, everything, revolves around his phone. and, because the pace of life gets, faster and faster... phones down in five. and attention spans get shorter and shorter... and... you're probably not even listening to me right now. who has the time to type out actual words? and that's where we come in. the most important invention in the history of communication! emo gees. that's my home! textopolis. here, each of us does one thing, and we have to nail it every time. christmas tree just has to stand there, all festive. merry christmas! it's still september, tim! and princesses... i am so pretty. they just gotta wear their crowns and keep their hair comb. we are so pretty. devil, poop, thumbs up, they just show up and they're good to go. but for the faces, the pressure is on. cryer always has to cry, even if he just won the lottery. hurray, i'm a millionaire! laugher's always laughing, even if he's just broken his arm. ahh!! ah! i can see the bone!! ah ah ah ah ah... and me, i'm a meh. so i gotta totally be over it all the time, you know? like meh, who cares. which is not as easy as it sounds. i gotta be mehhhhhhhhh i GOTTA! be! mehhhhhhhhh morning misses D, i see you have the little minis with ya! oh, they're so... cute!

Hi! i mean.. hey.. as you know, i'm smiler, i'm the system supervisor here, because I was the original emoji. here's how it works. it's nothing fancy! wait a minute... it's really fancy! you each have your own cube on the emoji bar! if alex chooses you, should you be so lucky, your cube will light up! it's showtime! the scanner will scan you, and that scan will get sent right up to alex's text box. and let me tell you guys, there is nothing like getting scanned for the first time. a har, you're gonna love it. now over here is the favorites section, where you'll find all the most popular emo gees. and of course, you'll find my cube here. whoo. you are smooth. just doing my duty. ha ha ha! what did i say? come on, tell me you aren't just a little bit tempted? steven, for the last time, i don't want to buy a timeshare. come on, man, it's high five! you know me! i'm a favorite! Alex hasn't picked you in weeks. when he stops picking you, you're no longer a favorite. there's gotta be some sort of mistake, i mean, look at me, i'm an attractive, hand-giving high five! oh! fistbump! come on in! hey, ladies! FISTBUMP? he's a knucklehead! literally! look at him, I can look like that! ugh, ow, cramp.. big mistake.. oh... help me.. help up a hand.. oh... here you go... thanks mate... hey, little man, how about you create a distraction, and i'll just slip under the rope! uh, oh, is someone lost? smiler, hiya, just leaving. yeah, you know, just killing time before i go back to my cube in the far corner where Alex can't even See Me ANYMORE! you may not be a favorite anymore, but you will always have a place, in a cube! yeah, in the nosebleeds... uh, i'm standing right here? words hurt. the most important thing I can tell you is to just be yourself... basically, happy itself... i am always smiling... places, please! emo gees to your cubes! attention, we've got incoming! gotta be meh, gotta be meh. oh my gosh, my own cube! i can't believe it... oh, i could put a plant over here, and over here could go an inspirational calendar, okay, gotta be meh... look at our son get on there, i'm beaming... with pride! you don't think he'll actually get picked, do you? heiroglyphics. heiroglyphics was an ancient language of picture forms. does that remind anyone of anything. hello. a language of pictures... anyone? early heiroglyphics back in ancient... i gotta reply to addie's text! what should i write? nothing! nothing? words aren't cool. ok, be cool, be cool... alright, alex is not sure how he wants to play this... oh! i would really love it to be me! beam me up! beam me up! i need thumbs up on standby! oh yeah! thumbs up is going in! wait! alex is changing his mind! he's moving! ok, looks like it's gonna be meh... i'm so nervous, i could almost shrug. we are go for meh! initiating scan! okay, you can do this. ah! i can't do this! i can't do it! stop the scan! i can't, it's too late! oh! what's he doing? he's making the wrong face! good for him, little... wait, what? ugh. abort, abort! oh, shi... shut it down, shut it down! ah! what is that emoji? all the emo gees present, evacuate the cube! evacuate the cube! i gotta get out of here! i'm trying! oh, jeez. sorry, everybody. that is not what i meant to do! i kinda.. i kinda panicked.. are you even a meh at all? uh, who, me? like you are, is a malfunction! a malfunction? no, i can be meh, just give me one more chance? you know what would be really fun? a board meeting, where we can find out what to do with you! i just wanted to be useful, you know, fit in! now everybody's calling me a malfunction. i am a malfunction. even if you are a malfunction, gene, your mom and dad still love ya. i knew you weren't ready. let's get you out of here and take you home. one day, all of this will blow over, and everyone will almost forget about what you did. until then, you should probably stay locked up in the apartment. wait, you're gonna hide me away? you're embarrased of me. it's for your own safety. we're trying to protect you, son. gene, where are you going? i'm not going to run away from this. i'm an emoji, and, even though i'm not exactly sure which one... i've gotta have some sort of purpose here, i know it. gene, no! sweetie, please! so, how'd it go, gavel? hey, lightbulb, tell me what's going on in there. what... poop... what is it? tell me turd, tell me truth. what happened? i know it was an accident. we all have accidents you're so soft, poop. not too soft, i hope. i came up here to defend myself, but, uh, you seem pretty happy. so, good news? i'm always happy. oh, right, yeah, truth. but the only thing that could ever make me unhappy, is if one of our emo gees has made a mistake. which would cause alex to lose faith in the phone... and then, our whole gets wiped out! smiler, i devil pinky swear promise to you that i will never, ever make a mistake in the cube again. oh, we know you won't, gene. we know you won't! ha ha, you know, the first time you said it it sounded genuine, but then you repeated it, and, and then, now it's weird. we're setting you up! with our best anti virus bots! so they'll, like, uh, they'll just, they're gonna fix me? actually, delete you. but yes! wait, what? if you get deleted, you don't have to worry about department heads, or the future, or lying about being a malfunction! because you're deleted, right? right! good job! bots! no! stop, he's escaped! party time! oh, wait a minute...

Rumor is the  black cadets wrote it on there own boards..... maybe the Airforce needs to investigate before  jumping on the racism band wagon !!!!
Well done that man! Just when you think that there is no hope for the human race, when you think  that despair is the only possible response to the world around you, along comes   a man like this who makes you proud to be a human, makes you think that maybe just maybe there is hope. Such an eloquent and heart-felt speech.If it doesn't move you, you aren't fit to be called human.
I can't watch the entire thing. I get too upset thinking how our own president can't do nor say such intelligent things like this... these smart leaders like this guy must get so upset thinking we have an idiot running our country and he's this guys boss
Let the witch hunt begin!
thanks again for your support in this case I thought you might want to get the boys together and have a good weekend and I'll be back in town tomorrow
Next United States president
JFK  wanted a black astronaght to be part of the original 7 of Project Mercury but there weren't any black test pilots
I don't understand the dislikes I just don't understand.
This will stay as one of the greatest speeches of the century.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!  Wonderful talk!  Admirable leadership that should be an example for all, particularly our current President!  I served two years in the military, and this makes me very proud.
OMG, he makes me feel so proud of our military and our people.
Propaganda to the max
Excuse, shit head, Iam 63yrs. old.. Where I went to school, we was tought  that to GET RESPECT you had to GIVE RESPECT!!! NOW, what I want to know is,, we're to RESPECT PEOPLE WHO DON'T RESPECT US.. IS THIS WHAT YOU'R SAYING..
...racism is spreads like fire from the bottom, from the single source of ignorance, from the single individual expressing his dissatisfaction, disgust and hate of things around him...then becomes a wildfire and consumes even the strongest of institutions...
Now that's what a military talk sounds like
This guy should be the fucking president of the united states
19,000 likes Versus 764 racists. Racists, there's your ratio.
Its a shame there aren't more Lt. Gen. Jay Silveria's in this world!
What's about 700+ dislike?
know that just like the Jew lead blacks into wanting to gangbang sell drugs and kill' through paying some big money to shuck and juvie' like NWA 2pac chef keef JayZ and many others' who chose to lead there people into the dark' for a life of riches' based on lies and destruction of there own people'..yup he would know that the honest pro whites are exposing the mass control the Jew has in media Hollywood and collage university's .. and he would know that the Jews are using the blacks to try to choke out the white mans truth because he is trying to wake everyone up to the false reality' that  is being drilled into your mind-all day everyday..
Well said sir. Racism and intolerance have no place in the modern world.
Heroes like this. Heroes like this are the real reason I wake up in the morning, the real reason I can sleep at night. The ideas they have, the love they bring. \n\nI have a good idea:\n\nWith all the horrible people spreading hatred out there, threatening to nuke us, our allies and with people on our side threatening to nuke people we don't like, we need to spread the idea of love and respect. We will not, should not and cannot tolerate disrespect and/or disparage any other person for any reason given besides their actions towards another human being. \n\nSo if you hate another person for the color of their skin, you need to GET OFF OF YOUTUBE. You don't belong here, where love and compassion should exist. \n\nIf you hate me or anybody else, you need to GET OFF OF YOUTUBE. \n\nIf you, angry, decide to dehumanize somebody based on something they don't like, you need to GET OFF OF YOUTUBE. \n\nThis is a community. We respect one another with passion, consideration, love and the utmost respect and honor.\n\nIf you cannot, will not and if you think you should not do that for the innocent people who do so much to help you and me because of the color of their skin, gender, age, country of origin and/or beliefs, not their actions, then you need to GET OFF OF YOUTUBE. \n\nThey are not the problem.\n\nYou are. \n\nAnd as people, we get rid of the things we don't like about ourselves, about our community.\n\nIf you are a nuisance to our community, then you need to GET OUT.
Say a joke\nThe United States has no racial discrimination~
They were Trump Supporters. I bet
Thank you for being human.
Why is it that some people in the comments are *more upset* about him condemning racism, than the actual act of racism, smdh 😒
The world need more leaders like Gen. Silveria...
I can't believe this has had only one million views. This man just virtually  declared himself running for office!
Those words shook me those words remind me of what the military felt like 10 years ago
trump is a grate president  yall just don't notice what he doing good cuse yall lesson to fox news and cnn they dont tell truth he bringing jobs to america he putting liberal in there place
JRLM you are a complete keyboard pussy because you refuse to use your real name nor a real photo of yourself. You and your words are without merit. LtGen Silveria's words are complete politically correct showboating which is destroying our military. Have you noticed, MORON, that the so-called racist words have not been published?
I do wish the so called President, the #45 would understand what this General speaks about....
Subscribe to my channel!\nReward: watch me give all racist 10 kicks up his ass!
Never was a patriot but after watching this, I feel proud to be an American.
ITS ONLY RACIST IF YOUR WHITE. FUCK THEM LIBTARDS.  I FUCKIN HATE THE RACE SHIT!!!!  I AM 75% CHEROKEE FUCK ALL LIBERALS AND AND WHITE GUILT. FUCK THE LEFT . I WANT ALL LEFTIST TO LEAVE MY FUCKIN LAND.
Agree with what he said. All groups have good and bad people with good and bad qualities. No one is perfect, and I don't think anyone is 100% evil. My question thou is: Do they know exactly who did it, and why? Was it truly someone evil showing there views? Was it an idiot just doing a protest to be like all the others protester? Like he said, protest but no options to make things better. Was it someone just flame baiting to get things going? One final option, was it some one of the offended group doing it to themselves to make the issue blow up? This has happened in a few cases. Regardless, we do have to live with one another, and if we work together, we can make this a better world.
Diversity really has nothing to do with racism.  You could have a perfectly equal amount of all races represented and still have racism.
774 racists out of 20,000? Good job you guys, we're makin Youtube great again!
My better idea, stop promoting garbage like Charlottesville and Ferguson.  \nHad people let the White Supremacists have their little rally in Charlottesville it would have been small, not on TV and quickly forgotten.  The problem was that the counter protesters honestly believe that the white supremacists don't have the right to free speech.  \nThe Ferguson protest was about a cop who justifiably killed a man for robbing a convenience store and then resisting arrest and trying to harm the cop.  \nCan we please just promote the truth....can the leaders in the military, like Lt. Gen Jay Silveria, please just promote the truth.\nRacism in the US is lower than anywhere else in the world and the more we keep beating this drum of racism the more people are going to resent each other AND THAT CREATES MORE RACISM!!!  For the love of God, PLEASE, stop this insanity.\nNigger is a horrible word, it is a dehumanizing word, much like the words that the military tells our soldiers to use when we go to war with another country.  Chinks, Japs, Krauts, Ruskies, Commies, camel jockeys, all used to dehumanize the enemy so the soldiers can sleep at night after killing another human being.\nBTW, I refuse to say the n word instead of nigger.  I will never call someone a nigger, but I refuse to act like a 3 year old, cover my mouth and say the n word when speaking to adults.  If you are offended, I don't care.
I'm not American but this guy makes me wanna be one ASAP. Fuck stupid ideologies.
This is the type of Man is need it to be our President. Not the piece of shit of a so call president that we have now.
I knew I should've joined the AirForce.
We need a people like this man he represent how is this nation and how directed these democracy  Not like the clown we have in the White House.
Give this man a fourth star for that collar!
Okay Lt.Gen. Silveria, who was the culprit?  What was their racial identity?  WHY did they do it?  We understand there was a racial epitaph but that same word you can hear 30 times a minute on any rap radio station.  What if it were another black person who wrote it?  What if it were one of the occupants of the room looking to start a false narrative because they were on the verge of failing the prep school?  Lots of questions and you have not provided any answers.  I understand the Air Force is not really a branch of the military but sheesh, quit being a PC lump.  Get some facts before you express your outrage that may not be what you think it is.  Duh.
Thank you for posting such good videos! It is always great to see there's still good people out there!
is 3 star GN3 or is it GE ?
Are you prepared to join the ranks of the worlds created Air Force? Aim high, fly, fight, win
Yes. Speak against hate.\nOur president should take notes on this speech.
why doesn’t this man run for presidency ? He needs to. he would be a great leader
Sounds like a classic race hoax to me. 😉
Oh look all the officers are white.
until the philosophy which holds one race superior and another...   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XHEPoMNP0I
I wish I were 32 years younger standing in Mitchell Hall with my fellow American cadets to hear such a spiritful speech live.
In 2017 this is STILL going on!! President Lincoln signed a piece of paper making every man and woman even and STOPPED A RACE OF PEOPLE BEING SOME PERSONS PROPERTY!!!!! And that was done centuries ago yet in this day and age he would be dumbfounded what the FUCK that’s happening in the States today?!?!? I’m in Glasgow,Scotland and I get it for being Irish/Scottish even to this day! And it mostly ends in violence! 2017 a few months and it’s nearly 2018? Really? Best term is “KNUCKLE DRAGGERS” because they definitely can’t walk upright!! And don’t get me wrong I watch the news and read about the news world wide! And the people who are SUPPOSE TO “PROTECT AND SERVE!” Seem one of the biggest threats in the States today!! Will they face proper justice? AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN NO!!! No they won’t!!! Children are getting shot through car doors,they are getting shot for “ASKING TOO MANY QUESTIONS” and simply getting killed for “Walking down the street! The police force have became a law Apon themselves! And it ain’t the law they where the badge for!!! where when a “Incident” happened and they get PAID FUCKING LEAVE! And sent to a shrink to talk about “There feelings,anger BLAH BLAH FUCKING BLAH!” Where any normal citizens feet wouldn’t hit the ground and you’d be facing 15-25 years in some states! It’s in there amendment rights,if they are not on police record and depending on there history in some states they can apply for a “Concealed weapon!” But out that % of ppl cleared what’s the % of people just snapping and using one? I’m just asking simple questions to a bad,sticky subject that America lives with every day!! I don’t know how the UK would deal with the same power if given it? More than likely 100’s of people would take advantage of the fact! No doubt they would!! And it’s said for every legal gun on the street of the States,there’s 20 illegal guns in there place? That’s a WTF moment right there!!!
Yeah I bet it was written by the offended race just to feed the liberal narrative.
I'm not racist, I just hate that black men get all the bitches. One day I'ma start a revolution, and there will be another civil war in America. Slavery ruined everything. I wish I had a time machine to stop slavery from ever happening. I'm going to hell for the mistakes our founding fathers' made. Forgive me God, but if I don't do it, no one will, and somebody's gotta do it.\nFuck u niggas, come at me I dare u, my eyes reder than the devil is.
Why are the poor, deplorable southerners the racist ones? Why aren't the upper class intelligent costal whites racist ?
I’m confused, where are the offended black people, all I see is white people shaming other white people for being racist. Like wtf is going on, first pewdiepie says the n word and a bunch of white people are offended, like are white people secretly black?
Watch how many whites​ come and comment wait to all the facts come out..
EQUALITY: ] Well then, should we conclude that we....are better than others? No, not at all, for we have already shown that  A L L    PeOpLe, whether Jews or Gentiles, are under the power of sin. ... 23 For everyone has sinned; we  A L L   fall short of God's glorious standard.Romans3[THEREFORE,  I urge you, first of all, to P R A Y  for   A L L   pEoPlE.  ASK God to help them;  INTERCEDE  on their behalf, and give THANKS for them. 2 P R A Y  this way for kings and ALL who are in authority so that we can live peaceful and quiet lives marked by godliness and dignity. 3 This is good and pleases God our Savior, 4 who wants EVERYONE to be saved and to understand the truth. 5 For there is only one God and one Mediator who can reconcile God and humanity--the man Christ Jesus. 6 He gave his life to purchase freedom for EVERYONE. This is the message God gave to the world at just the right time.....I desire therefore that the men PRAY EVERYWHERE, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting, disputing, dissension, etc;1Timothy2[ The person who does not love does not know God, because God is love. 9 By this the love of God is revealed in us: that God has sent his one and only Son into the world so that we may live through him. 10 In this is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins. 11 Dear friends, if God  SO  loved us, then we also ought to love one another.1John4[........ Instead, we will SPEAK the TRUTH in LOVE, growing in every way more and more like Christ, who is the head of his body, the church.Ephesians4
😭
Usausausausausausa
Yep
GOOSEBUMPS
Get out!!!
What leadership looks like.
Well said Sir.\nWell said...
Wake Up: The enemy wants to kill Americans, they do not care how about your skin tone.  When you're in battle and the enemy is bearing down on you, the last thing you're going to care about is the race of your fellow soldier. Embrace the things we share in common, they far outweigh our differences. As a military the saying United we stand, Divided we fall holds true. If you haven't learned that in your military leadership training, you're not fit for leadership or military service. Get out - Lt Gen Silveria couldn't have made it any simpler for those that have a hard time learning.
O
Bad ass mother fucker right there!!!!!!
Whooo fuckn raaaaa!
Thats your answer https://youtu.be/jn2x_qs2V6A Idiots!!!!
Trump's America
Machiavelli at its best.
Nigger
It sure was.
Speech was 🔥🔥🔥
👏
Trump Trump Trump !!  MAGA
Poop swastika part II
700 Plus racists in here
Truer words were never spoken.
Lt. General Silveria for President 2020....💯
From a US Army combat vet: well said Lt. Gen, cut fence and sort those racist bastards out....
Yeah when America was founded by whites it should be for whites this is why I'd never join a army that allows nigger and Muslims and faggots
racism is childish and children don't even do it
Its good to know people in those branches Care as a black man i fucking salute you Sargent
You'll never get this speech from 45 because divisiveness and intolerance were key to his success.
Most likely, it was a fake hate crime as usual. Wont hear anything after its exposed as a hoaxed as with previous incidents.
What you see on this video isn't strength, its pure weakness, this clown knows each and every one of his cadets would rather shoot at each other than anyone they are payed to murder in the middle east.
And people wonder why they kneel
Racists are insecure moronic imbeciles
finally a white person speaks up
Lt General Silveria: Don't you have something more important to do? Perhaps preparing the students to handle the next war?
Hypocrisy 101 right there. The power of our diversity makes us stronger, no one can question our values, if you can't treat someone with dignity or respect you need to get out.... To blow the crap out of thousands,if not millions of innocent people around the world for no good reason. Great job America

LMAOO SO HAPPY YOU LEFT SMOSH THIS VIDEO REMINDS ME OF OLD TIMES

First time I've watched a YouTube video in a while and thought dayum that's creative, quality content. Love this!
This was so funny, oh my god.
This is real life gaming lmao!
Am I the only one who thinks about daily life like this? Like it makes things pretty interesting.
Telltale game this so true in my case
I want to see a full gameplay of this 😂
_If I'm being honest..._\n\n\n\n\nI just wanna confuse you Lilly.
Real life the game\n\nMade by: telltale
Does anyone here know where I can buy this game?!😂
this reminds me of the smosh old days
I would be so happy if these 2 dated 😭
this game almost seem like the impossible quiz..... but a reality version
This was so frustrating to watch because I wanted to stop Anthony from making the wrong choices 😫
press b to blow press a to hug
It's the dark souls of awkwardness of the dark souls of the dating sims of the dark souls

*HIDE YOUR COOLERS, NOBODY IS SAFE*
Brown was mad cause he has himself on his fantasy team
Its spreading, first Odell now AB, when will the madness stop? #CoolerLivesMatter
The cooler deserved it
AB will propose to the water cooler next game
That's a suspension for hitting/tossing a defenseless player
**Sad trombone plays**
Big Ben on the decline
He was wide open & Big Ben didn’t see him. & all of the sudden maybe that’s why he’s mad
Would you be mad if you were wide open on the other side of the field? Just curious
This needed to be posted?
This better be talked about on all the sports shows since they always do with O'Dell
Don't turn into Odell please AB.
can't blame Antonio. Wide opened and Ben throws an incomplete pass
LMAO
#StopCoolerAbuse
Man ppl are dumb this is part of the competitive fire that gives AB an edge. He cares about winning. It was a huge missed opportunity and those moments are super frustrating for any athlete that wants to win. There’s a reason he’s the best in the business #businessisbooming
Looks like he's mad at the police and military to me.
Every right to be angry.  You are the best wide receiver on the team.  You should always be the first option.  Big Ben is declining.
Lol shut tf up brown cuz he didn't even see your stupid ass
I understand he was upset but to pull away from the coach and throw a cooler is not exceptable
Get that man the ball!! #tonytoetap #GOAT #callGod
Sorry guys.
Anger management
Sit that p.o.s. !!
Under control haha that's the opposite of the nfl
Come on Brown, don't stoop to Obj's level.
Pathetic. The dude is being paid millions and yet he acts like a little kid
The moment you realize your offense is more dysfunctional than the Browns offense. Life as a Ravens fan. 😞😒
Maybe he should take a knee to bring this attention to ben
Ben and the other 2 Amigos from his draft class or trash now.
He better apologize to that cooler if he scores a TD next week... 😂✊️
I wouldn't blame him. He was wide open and close to possibly scoring a Touchdown
Rumor has it AB apologised afterwards and asked the cooler to marry him.Prenub ofcourse.
So nobody cares that an NFL qb didn't see a wide open AB??
Some People Take a Knee. Some People Throw a Cooler. \nThe Struggle is Real!
He's mad cause his barber canceled last minute :/ AB didn't look as fresh as he always does
that wrong man he did nothing to you... that cooler had a family
Its ok when Brown does it but when Odell does it, hes a baby, and he complains too much!!! Makes sense.
Tbh, I'd be angry too. He woulda scored if Ben saw him.
This was just too funny, but All I can say is it's AFC north football. I mean things are gonna get heated what do you expect. And AB is a competitor and he probably knew how much that TD could've helped us since typically when we vs the Ravens those games are usually decided by 7 points or less
It was just the black coming out of him, nothing new.
I've watched Mike Tomlin teams look progressively less imposing, year after year. Even Ben said last year, regarding the Patriots What rivalry? We're the little brother
Take a knee for that kooler.
What a jerk its not like that caused them a loss. Get well soon Cooler.
Antonio is a competitor he wants to be the best he can be he trains hard and studies hard to do his job and when you do your and your wide open for could have been a touchdown it's heartbreaking.
Well, if you can not make a play on the field (get on TV).  (Get on TV) Make one on the sideline. :)
I think his teammates were clownin' him the whole game for some reason. Watch the full game, they all did the signature AB first down drop
Its Enough Clear out this coaching staff.
shouldve been a TD watched the whole game , Handle that better Ab go to yo QB and say yo bro im open take yo time dont snap on yo team and yo OC . disappointed in u from that .
Man this is gonna look bad for him and the steelers organization. First not showing up for the anthem now you're best player is acting like a fool. C'mon now guys this isn't steeler like
I guess Antonio never dropped a pass that could have been a first down or touchdown.
He just mad he didn't get to twerk in the endzone like he usually does.
Ben on the decline FAST.
What was Ben looking at!
If this was Odell everybody would be like he a crybaby
Did everyone already forget about how the falcons blew a 25 point lead.
when will he propose to the cooler?
Now he needs to fight Josh Norman to be the new Odell Beckham
The cooler was wide open as well
This is what happens when you devote your entire life to a game that elementary school aged kids play in the backyard.
Showing this tantrum to the masses is why Terrell Owens is not in the hall of fame a few morbid these and Antonio might get this label.   Hopefully T.O. makes it in next year
Cooler lives matter. Petulant child.
Were all boy cotting baby
Soft
oof
I LOVE IT.
Spoiled brat
You Mad Bro????    Richard Sherman.
spoiled
DUDE Dont become ODell Crybaby ..... Keep the skills loose the Tantrums ..
better him than Odell
Thank god for Julio
Hes such a baby
Like that before
After the Facebook live bs I knew the Steelers never should have signed him.His long time trainer dumped him because he is turning into TO. Total me first diva.This guy will be traded in the offseason.Hard worker but not a team first guy.Those type guys don't win superbowls.Stats mean more!
That's the first time I have ever seen brown get mad
Jesus Christ is Lord and is the only way to Heaven
I did the same thing because I got ab on my fantasy team lol
I don’t blame him, Ben could have gotten 6..
antonio brown needed to cool down but he keeps on knocking over coolers. #coolerlivesmatter
Not the Antonio brown ik and love
Just another overpaid child throwing a tantrum for not getting his way. Poor big baby
Brown is prima-donna just like Odell Beckham.
Todd Haley almost got stole on lol
Crap
first
Acting like Odell?\nJulio jones>Odell and Antonio brown
He is too expensive to have on your line up and not consistent.
If Odell is immature then Antonio Brown is what.......?
“Ab is better than obj because ab doesn’t throw tantrums”
God bless you guys and your families
What's the NFL?
Meanwhile the score 26 - 9 was the BIGGEST margin of victory that Big Ben has ever had against the Ravens, w/ the Stillers winning 10 out of the last 22 games in Baltimore. AB can't rejoice over a W? #smh
I already know no ones gonna talk about this, BUT if Odell gets mad no no that’s mainstream news all over social media
Not supried it's the Pittsburgh Kneeleers
Awww u gonna cry?
I would have made sure he wasn’t open
Steelers are crybabies
Ben is stupid and about as good as Jay Cutler right now? Give Jay all of Ben's weapons and all the sudden Jay isn't as terrible any more. Antonio will have to be patient with Ben. Ben doesn't have the vision of an elite quarterback and is losing his physical skills rapidly. Ben has mentally retired and will not be able to lead this very talented team to another SB victory.
But my desire to hear the end of this story is so strong.
Dont give up man you can do it belive in yourself
What is the outro song?
Have you tried putting it in rice?
But apes can run on all fours!
Idk what I would do if I was told I couldn't walk again.That's my biggest fear.
Replace the human doctors with a real one (God)!\nWho forgives all your iniquities; who heals ALL YOUR DISEASES; (Psalms 103:3)
Damn man my knee started doing that shit! It's all crunchy and sound like rice crispy upset now.
I like how this was a tribute to how much running means to you just in case the worst comes true. I honestly hate running but this video got to me. I can't imagine how scary this is but I know you'll make it through no matter what happens. Good luck dude!
I feel your pain casey, fitness is my outlet, my way to release and injuries really suck, ive been going at it for 6 years and im only 21
I 100% agree with his mentality on running, I'm an 8th grader running about 50 miles a week and I'm the first runner for Mohawk Trail HS
Time to start mountain biking
Dude nothing is impossible you have done some crazy shit in your life and letting some doctor tell you you cant run means nothing you can do anything you want 👌😎
cool story bro...I wonder when you will never ego again?
Your videos are so addicting to watch man. Just the way you carry yourself and the style that you film.
Guys lets not go *running* to any conclusions\n(I'm so sorry)
The cause to your pain might be heel striking and overstriding. try to to land on your heel and try to land with a bent leg, instead of straight.
Anyone else know the song from life at complex?
Sorry about the concerns. Hope good news comes to you. This is one of the most beautifully composed stories I’ve ever experienced. Great great video!!!
What's the result
aw sorry about the stress man. positive vibes coming your way from Michigan!
For me it helped alot to stop running on pavement all the time and start running woods trails or certain parks with gravel or dirt roads instead. But there is still a debate whether running on harder surfaces are actually worse for you or not, but we do know that we automatically adjust the spring in our step based on the surface we are running on and that suggests it does not matter all that much, but all i know is that it helped for me to quit the constant pavement running and move on to other softer surfaces. But perhaps my brain was just bad at adjusting the spring in my steps. Hehe
I know the feeling I shouldnt be running because my hips give out and make me collapse. in my country the waiting lists are long and an operation wont fix it easily
Neistat you will never be grounded so long as you continue to vlog about your life
“I don’t like going to the doctor, I don’t ever like going to the doctor” wow he sounded so terrified
I'm 14 and I love running but have terrible knees. It's because I started running as I hit puberty and disrupted the growth of my knees. But I'll see what happens
this is what happens when u run it happens to all runers eventually in different ways..good luck btw
Shit Casey. Thats why i don't run. I have knee problems and it sucks. Get well
Inconceivable ! Not to run is like not eating ! 45 years in and it hurts like hell now, BUT ! it is still the best thing in my life ! You get to a stage where you do what you can and learn to be happy with it !  Good luck !
What's the name of the song at the end of the video. I've looked I can't find. Please helppp
Why is this getting so much hate
... was hit by car on Delancy St a few years ago ... crushed my femur and broke my pelvis ... can not run again but can cycle and thankful for that ... maybe you should channel your fear into compassion for others who actually have limited mobility
I hope that your leg is ok, it's so not easy not to feel grounded. But I hope you will be ok to run because I like to run and it helps me with stress and anxiety.
You go to the same hospital as me
What shoes is he wearing
I Got my Back injury when I was 27... took me out but of the game,  I had to reinvent myself. You're ahead of the game and a Superior Creative type, I have the absolute confidence in you. Keep on moving don't stop!
So can he run?
You might try cleaning up your form. Lots of heavy heel strike from the looks of it.
There's million of starving people, war, deadly diseases And this this guy can't run PEOPLE ARE DYING
What was the update casey
Casey you are my role model. Running, healthy lifestyle, travelling. God bless you
what is the name of the outrotrack?
I just got into trampolining and I some how injured my back and my back could be fucked, my bones age faster than me, I am 14 and my bones could possibly be 25. I hope not and I hot my back is fine and I will be able to do my favourite things
Have you tried barefoot running? It's turned my knee injuries around it could work for you. Or just using shoes without padding such as vibrams or some merrels.
I used to be a racist
I feal your pain! Im 14 and I have arthritis in my hips and ankles.
Casey I’m a 14 yr old who during running at school ripped a piece of cartilage off my knee and had to have surgery I wanted to play football when I was older and was told never to work out/run again
Good. You'd make a terrible president.
Casey Hi from Kerala, India..I watch all of ur videos but commenting for first time... Really I learned a lot from u and this video is very touching.. the end is mind blowing... U'll be back soon.. we will pray for u bro
So Casey, what's the ending to this story?
Welcome to life. Get used to it.
I've never seen myself in someone as I do in this man
GOOD music choice YES! always on my running playlist
I wish we could switch bodies for a few days, my body needs some running.
Over the years... my boy, casey neistat, has changed so fast over the years... damn.
Casey you wear Self Pity like a drunk hoe !
I'm so scared now will that's happen to me?
7 million subs! last year you only had about 4 - 5 million! keep going strong casey
I practice Yoga at 52, you can surely do yoga too. stop running all of the time.
Kind of hate you...
NO DONT GIVE UP RUN CASEY MOTHERFUCKING NEISTAT RUN
You sound like me when I talk about working out. It's the ONE THING I GET FOR ME THAT'S JUST ME - I feel this in my soul
Why is this nomad in my recommeded videos?
The starting is so gross
Okay but I mean...this title is fucking lame.\nCome on man.\nHave you ever heard of bad luck brought by stupid titles?!\n@CaseyNeistat
Who the ruck cares, i always thought your channel was kind of overrated
literally the one fucking thing casey does in every video and he can't do it anymore
Stay strong. You will run again.
How are u gonna run from a bomb from North Korea
CASEY WHAT HAPPENED IT HAS BEEN 4 DAYS!!
Casey man -- swimming! Dive in to it a bit and you might find it your next best thing. Wishing you all the best with all my heart man. You'll be fine. You're spreading love around. It will work back for you now. Guaranteed. Please, cheer up buddy!
wow i just seen a place that service scat scans  at tell nena  hello for me
It hurts to see someone not be able to do the thing that makes them happy.
Casey : 3 months ago\n **shows 4 fingers**
clickbaitneistat
stay strong casey
What a fucking whiner.
5k pr?
Have you tried yoga?

Vlogcreations
Ew?
Nooo
Ride a bike
this video was fucking hilarious
Black Skinheadddddddddddddddddd
Good luck Casey, good luck
Wow 😧
Dam.
Lol so funny 😂
Feels Bad Man;(
Ew that sound
W
That sound sucked dick
Going through something similar :(
Swim!!!!!!!
Vintage Casey Neistat! Inspirational AF!,
Casey never seems to be able to get any perspective outside of himself. How many millions of people have bad knees? Massive narcicist.
What’s the song at the end called?
This was uploaded on my B-Day!!!
Can someone explain to me the meaning of those gestures?
when she said panic, i instantly thought of beebo
SHIT WHEN THE KIDS AND EVERYONE STARTS TO SING!!!!😭😭😭
DODIE You get back there and audition!!
I absolutely love this song. This music video is brilliant, it strikes a cord deep inside you every time. Love it Dodie!!
this is so beautiful
This is so beautiful. So fucking beautiful. You're my idol and this is the reason why. So many beautiful important things are being produced and spoken about by you.
I absolutely love this song! The video is heartbreaking, but so incredible!
Dodie has such a beautiful soul.
fuck the 515 who disliked this they are heartless robots
i dont get it :'( someone help
i havent cried like this in a while
i can relate to this song a lot. i know i’m not the worst person in the world (aka a 1/10) but i also know i’m definitely not the best person (10/10) people talk to me, people seem to like, i’m in a lot of sports, i get good grades, what’s not to love about me? apparently a lot. most days i feel like i’m just average, i don’t stand out. people don’t want to talk to be because i’m not very interesting. i have plain conversations and dress very bland. my looks aren’t he best either. the only thing that stands out to me is my height (i’m 5’7) im the tallest girl in my class but other than that, i’m pretty “normal” or what people would classify as “normal” some days it’s fine and some days i want to rip my own head off and scream and people, pleading them to give me a chance and get to know me so they can see i’m not as boring as i may look. it sucks truely but you can overcome it. change your style, talk to people first, be more confident and soon you’ll feel like a 7/10 at least
this is beautiful thank you for this
Jesus that was good. I love this song so much.
if the blue shirts aren't a nice nod to La La Land's auditioning scenes! I love to feel Dodie's passion for that fantastic film. Great Video. Were they surpressing dance or having pain they tried to push down? not sure.. anyone up for discussion?
seeing dodie cry is one of the saddest things i've ever seen
was that a la la land reference with the casting ? all wearing the same color
THE SECOND I SAW STEVIE I FREAKED OUT!!! DAMN ilove this vid so much <3
You never know what’s going on behind the scenes.
There are tears in my eyes. This is beautiful
So much love for the music video i can't even. It goes to show that no matter how shitty you feel about yourself, there are so many other people out there who feel the same way you do. You're never truly alone. You're so much more than a 6/10, and a number on a scale can't possibly define you. <333
Oh \nI wasn't crying until she cried
Literally my new favorite song. Coincidentally, I was introduced to dodie the same day I was to ptv. I have weird music tastes.
SO POWERFUL im crying :(((( i love this so much
INCREDIBLE Dodie. I’m not crying I just have something in my eye!
just fantastic Dodie. Sammy is a fantastic director too
😿😿😿i am crying right now
I didn't sleep well yesterday and ended up with a really sore neck that I kept touching all day at school. When I got home, I saw this on trending and screamed at the fact that dodie released a new music video. When I watched, I was really shocked at not only how much of an amazing role model she is for the youth like me, but the fact that she can read minds as well :') I cherish dodie so much and this caring family we are here.
liked before i even got to press play
I’m took me so long to figure out why they were doing the shoulder thing
I didn't think I could relate to something so much
This was a nice slow paced video for a nice slow paced song. Good job Sammy
one thing i really love about art, and that you really often do, is how it can be open to interpretation. different people are going to take different things out of that in different points of their lives, and that's amazing. \nthat's why i hope my creations will one day be opened for other people to see. it must be amazing to see various interpretations of the stuff you create. and to know that people spend time appreciating that and thinking about that like i do with your music and the music videos you make. \nthank you for being such an inspiration. even if you never see this comment, that's fine.
I have ASD and am struggling to understand this video.  Why does she look like she has a painful shoulder?  Can someone explain this to me.  Loved the song and video, just my brain isn't working!
SAMMY PAUL YOU GENIUS, i love this mv so much!!!!
damn they gotta check out their shoulders
the whole video here is so well crafted like the choreography and the camera angles and the whole thing is just artistically so well done, dodie, sammy and the whole team should be so fucking proud of this
she is a gift, just a lil slice of hope in this dark world
She is good at showing the truth.
Those 500 dislikes are the guys who go their drinks spilled on them \n\n\n\nFAKE ACCOUNTS
can someone pls explain this video to me???
This is a fantastic song and music video. I love you SO much, Dodie. You inspire me and a lot of other people too. ❤💜💛💚💙
I’m very confused but I somehow understand it enough that I cried.
Damn onion ninjas are back at it again
What’s wrong with everyone’s shoulder what???
What does the shoulder thing mean, is it symbolism for being hit by anxiety or depression or something?
this is so emotional. i cried.
Omgg is she referencing la la land???
i think I'm in love! xxxxx
Why does she keep touching her shoulder? what am I missing?!
this was honestly amazing. another great job by dodie
wow i really like the little movements!!
Please someone explain the shoulder thing xD
Cant wait to see you in Newcastle soo excited !!
WHY DID U DO THIS TO ME DODIE? I'm in tears
I feel like there was something symbolical behind the shoulder pain and need to touch their shoulders (can someone explain???)
I am in tears and so proud omd
God isn't this the biggest fucking mood
Well, that was beautiful
how does one doesn't love dodie. i love her so much and this music video is so beautiful :')
I can relate to this song so much ugh Doddie you're amazing,
i have literal chills and have been crying for the past ten minutes, this is exactly how i feel most of the time
This makes me think of Poppy...you know, Poppy's a dancer, just turned sixteen? Because as some have pointed out, the mental illness theme in this video has a sort of contemporary dance feel to it. It just made me think of Pas de Deux in that way.
Dodie man your music is so pure and wonderful why are you turning all your stuff into a production
👍
this is inexplicably mesmerizing. simply beautiful.
WHAT
IS THAT STEVIE OMG
Yup yup yup this yup 👍👍👍
I'm crying!
DODIE 😯😯
OMGGGGGGG

Dodie, that was beautiful 💗💗💗😢
THIS IS SO WONDERFUL GAHHH
My poor little heart
LOVE
Dodie would get shagged violently
Damn dodie, this is gorgeous
I hate her face so much
My first Dodie song. Not really my style, but I can recognize the effort and emotion put in. I can see why people like it.
Please do a History of Lucifer episode.
Doesn't matter if he is overpowered, if he was underpowered he would still always survive and win at the end of the story since superhero movies are biased and the good guy always comes out on top in the end. Maybe if superheroes would die in movies he would be considered overpowered since he wouldn't die due to his power but that's not the case so it doesn't matter if he is overpowered however awesome video :)
Why hasnt anyone asked for the History of Arris Quinones yet? :P
Human kind? Superman is far from human
Personally I like my characters more human. Characters like Batman, Spider-man, Flash, or Daredevil is because I enjoy relatable   characters. I can relate to the high school troubles of Peter Parker and understand the Flash's dilemma of not being fast enough. I get what Superman stands for and that's great but it's just not always as interesting. (to me at least)
I dont like how random his powers are.
I draw hope and inspiration from Superman :)
U should do a history on super boy prime
for me superman is the poison of justice league, is to overpo....
he is but his arrogant use with that power makes up for it.
No, no he is not.
he's not as Overpowered as one punch man XD
Is the sky blue?
Pffftt, if you guys think regular Superman is overpowered you need to get glasses. Go check out Superman Prime or One Punch Man if you want overpowered.
My man Goku can take him out
So you needed a 5 and a half minute video to explain if the most OP comic book character ever is OP?
Donald Trump is America's President now.  😝
Please do a more in depth teen titans video
The real question is How does Wonder Woman manage to use all that toilet paper in one sitting?
No, but Saitama is.
Bruce Timm reduced his power and still told the best Superman stories ever. It's lazy boring writers that make him OP because they don't want to think and let Superman plow through his problems instead of find real ways to fix them. So yes, he is overpowered, it doesn't take much effort of talent to draw a man lifting a planet.
Is Superman Overpowered? Yes, and No.\nThere are times where he does these amazing feats, but also times where he gets thrashed by seemingly weaker things. Superman unless given some form of power up isn't even the strongest being in DC. Either way I enjoy his comics, and stories as he was my first Super hero. He is what got me into Batman, WonderWoman, and DC entirely. Much like how Tho got me into Marvel.
Um DUH. He can go back in time and live life how he wants, he is omnipotent.
Saitama end of story
“During a time again in the world...”\nWhat time since WWII didn’t those in non-prosperous world need a super hero?
Two word : superman 64 😂... batman and goku all day
Thumbs down for needless Trump comment. Stick to what your channel is about.
Could have been a lot shorter
Captain universe is WAY more over powered
Most superheroes are overpowered. If you look at their power sets logically and compare them to both the villains they fight and the circumstances they find themselves in generally, they really shouldn't have any trouble with either, and the world around them wouldn't function well at all because of their existence
When you give a superhero that many diverse powerful abilities then give him a single weakness you create a really boring repetitive theme which is why i've never liked him as a hero, that sort of setup is what you see in villains or main bosses. Thats what makes me like him so much in injustice and makes it one of my favorite comics.
Superman vulnerability is always shown and exploited to depress his powers and symbol of invincibility
Considering logically Batman shouldn't even be able to beat Deathstroke and Ra's Al Ghul and yet he beats Superman shows me who the OP one really is, that plot armour is beyond God level.
I'm just here to read comments 🕵
So you never answered the question....
Really supergirl is stronger the superman
Mon-el is way more overpowered. The treatment for his lead poisoning allows him to have his powers under a red sun, he has all the same abilities as superman, plus he's had a green lantern ring.
well he wouldnt be very super if he wasnt
Which Superman are we talking about here? if you look at all versions of Superman, there are more overpowered versions like Cosmic Armor, Superman One Million, Superboy Prime, Superman Prime, Pre-Crisis Superman, Kal Kent, etc. They de-powered him then sometimes they create another version that is more powerful than the previous one. It's like the  writers can't make up their minds.
Rick from rick and morty can kill him
Would it be possible to make a History of Alex Mercer?
Definetly not, since he can get spanked by allot of people. Heck, Batman with prep can spank him. The same with Luther, plus almost everyone in his rouges gallery is pretty tough.
Lol no, Popeye would beat his ass like a small child
😂 He just needs a lil liquor-Then he’ll come strollin in to Lois’s apartment drunk and be like, “Lois, girls are gonna have bigger eyes than yours, and, and, they’ll see through lead too.” He crashes and breaks her tv. He’s embarrassed and melts it with his laser eyes. “Oh crap, Lois, what, what happened to your tv? It’s melted?” She turns on her bedroom light, and he flies the eff out and away as fast as he can. 😂
No, flash would destroy him
The answer is fuck yes
No, cause his penis  is small.
cant be that OP if he lost to batman whos powerless......js
Yes superman is to over powered.  When nothing can hurt you, it doesn't take courage to fight bad guys.  I have always looked at Superman as a bully.\nIt is more courageous to fight and overcome a problem when you are out matched or the under dog.\n\nThey need to put a cap on his power and make him use them more wisely.\n\nI am dredding to see the threat that will need Superman, Wonder Woman and Auqaman to stop.\n\nAs good as the Wonder Woman movie was, they just made another mistake.  They increased her power limit to that of a major God.  So since she could do something not even Zeus could do (kill the god of war), what chance do any human.  Have against her, now when she fights humans she will be just like Superman a bully that can't be hurt.
If justice League didn't have superman they would still have another op charecter Captain atom or Shazam or Martian Manhunter.
Let's all keep in mind that there really is no Superman.  It's just imaginary.  If you spend a lot of time thinking about this and you are older than 15, you need to refocus.  Work, family, religion, politics these all need your attention brothers.
They dont call him super for nothing faggot
If the main point of a hero is to encourage hope and optimism,  that hero needs flaws, limits, and obstacles. Heros that represent tenacity, hope, resilience, and perseverance must be more human in quality like Batman, Spider Man,  for example. Superman, for me, doesn't fit this bill. A hero needs to sacrifice something and at this point in comics, superman can give it all and then give it all again (which he has). Can a guy like that really sacrifice anything?
THIS IS NOT A VIDEO GAME. There is no overpowered. THIS IS NOT A GAME YOU CAN NERF
Can you be truly overpower if you have a weakness?? He has all these powers but all I have to do is have a piece of Kryptonite in my pocket and I could kick his ass all day!!! IJS lol
Seen the title no doubt yes
Is the sky blue, do bears shit in the woods? we have another question to add to the list.
Haha yes but that's why he is the boss!
The flash is more overpowered than him
yeeeeeeeas he is OP AS FUCK. FUCK SUPERMAN. BATMAN AND DOCTOR FATE CANON.
Who carries isn't that point to be overpowered to win people this Days saying everything is to overpowered like that really gets me pissed off
Who else hates when doing somthing about superhero’s but don’t know nothing about the superhero’s then you just want to roast them like when a person watches Wonder Woman the movie then your in the movies then person always like wow I didn’t know that a scream when did this happen  am I only like this is every superhero fan like this also
Oh Yea he's way to overpowered but the solar powered S-Man is not with out his flaws. He can be easily killed 😲 by a green rock, magic, psychic attacks or mine possession or getting really sick by alien gas or poison, being beaten to death by someone just as powerful as him like Doomsday or Darkseid or a 5th Dimensional Being that can do anything, also being under a red sun or taking our sun away then use via Batman weakness, a bullet thru the head! Why hasn't anyone blew his head off yet!? #Batmanshouldbedead!
You want Seth to come after you again.
If you're going to name a character super man, he has to be overpowered
I personally hate superman, because the truth is, like all other super heroes who seems like there is the possibility that the can die. This guy superman? Not even his weakness cryptonite seems to be able to harm him. He's just too impossible. I like batman because he's like a true representation of humans going brave and beyond (:
He lifted both a book of infinite pages and the physical manifestation of eternity, so the answer is yes.
That's the point. It's the story of a god trying to live among man. Not a generic anime character trying to fight everyone just for fun. If he was a bad character than he wouldn't have lasted 80 years.
I thought saitama san is overpowered.

Dislike. I don't need to hear your political opinions on a comic book video. Fuck you.
I had a smile on my face when I saw the thumbnail and it disappeared when you made that joke. Let's not get political next time. You can if you want but it just doesn't look good comming from Triune. I know it's only a joke but don't break my heart Triune. It's fractured right now.

I absolutely adore Simon's cat !! He captures all the annoying yet adorable and amusing quirks of cats so perfectly. I've had twelve cats during my lifetime who are sadly now all deceased and I miss them every single day. Watching Simon's cat though brings a smile to my face and often makes me laugh out loud ! 💕

Simon draws Simon drawing Simon's Cat.
c'est la Récré....!
Also its hard to keep them with smaller pets because they will constantly try to eat the small pet.
my childhood cat clawed my mom in the butt once. He tried to jump from counter to counter. She was in the middle digging for pans under the sink. He realized he wasn't going to make it. My mom's butt was his landing spot, she ripped him off her, and threw him across the kitchen into the family room. I couldn't  stop laughing. Poor little guy. I made sure he was ok, and cuddled him.
I’ll fuckin tie ya to a bed post with ya ass cheeks spread out an shit an put a hanger on the fire an let it sit there for a while then take it out an stick in in ya asshole like sssssssssssssssss

I love the videos because they're adorable
As a gal with moderately long hair, need an episode with a cat accidentally pulling one's hair by stepping on it... Mine as of late has been doing this. She jumps up on the back of my chair and wants to lay down and purr away but inevitably she steps on my hair. Plus, she seems to never be able to make up her mind as to which side of the chair she wants to face either.
Awh, this makes me sad that my Fluffbutt decided to sleep in the closet tonight. :(
9 minutes of simon's cat. SO HAPPY
¿Qué hace una plancha encima del refrigerador?
Regardless I still love my cat no matter what. <3
That eas great! And long too! 😁😂

Simon is like my cat ginger..

So true, no wonder we love them...Does that mean we are crazy?
Lesson learned. Replace all table lamps with LED so they can't be used by cats to get a tan.
Go to my channels leslie Singh and Ghetto Mama Mukbang and check out my pets. Thanks Subscribe
I remeber this and still watch it

this is what makes these so funny cos it so true what they do mine are just as bad  but i wouldnt be without them i bet the dislikes are dog lovers and hate cats lol omfg i loved the bit were it pooped in the hole and blamed the gnome lol but if a cat sees a hole he will use it lol
His eyes when he goes to toilet!lmao
Always happy to find a new story from Simon's Cat :)))  =^.^=
Such a talented cartoon artist! This is so much like my cat. You got the actions of a cat drawn perfectly.
So, so true. Blessed Be my furry friends. Some day we all shall meet again. I love each & every one of yr cartoon critters. U perfectly capture their essential spirit, awa their p.o.v. I particularly enjoy the it's their world, really, & we're just along for the ride, w/their permission, that is realization that comes thru when it's all said & done. We try to act all stern & head-of-household w/them, but deep down, we all know we're completely smitten & would jump thru a field of hoops for just one kitty kiss or outstretched puppy paw against our cheek. Who's really the pet, I wonder? I don't see them fawning over/cleaning up after us. I have always had a true & honest love & respect for our animal friends. They really oftentimes are more kindred to me than my own family/human companions. And they don't judge, so long as u care for them proper. I joke, but it's a win-win, really. Simon's Cat forever reminds me of this.
Anybody else notice the oven mitt hand towel combo in the 3rd short?
Cats are selfish, self-serving cunts that want what they want when they want it. Get a dog.
He threw the tissue in the trash and just said. Yes...
This is the online equivalent of those really bad comics from the funnies section of the newspaper
I've seen your videos since I was 6 years old. This cat is my childhood :)
This is hilarious I could not stop laughing 😂
Neither of my cats ever played with lasers.  They always gave me a look as if to say, I always thought better of you…  Give me something to actually catch, or no go.
I just got a kitten 4 days ago! She's 8 weeks old and her name is Kindle. :)
My cat is fat and fluffy like a cloud also it weighs 20 pounds...

i read that as cats can be a real pain in the ass
Romans 3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;\n\nRomans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, \nand shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the \ndead, thou shalt be saved.\n\nRomans 10:13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall \nbe saved.\n\nActs 2:38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one \nof you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye \nshall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
Imagine buying a new TV and your cat knocks it over. I had a cat once he bit me because he got hungry. I put him out never saw him again.
HA HA, LOLOUDLY, MAN!!! You was havin fun with that cat!
That exhale at the end was priceless
we are team that should be fighting for that 7-8 position and we strugling to get out of relegation zone
Didn't celebrate the goal? Because you don't like Sakho? If west ham are as shit as you say they are then who can blame him for wanting to leave. Fucking idiot.
Same every week with Dom win or lose it’s always doom and gloom dom
Spot on , we need a new manager asap
I agree with Dom for once Bilic has to go
You blame sakhos shit attitude, but he’s going to have that for as long as the fans will give him their shit attitude
Looks like the biggest problem at West Ham at the moment are the fans. Get behind the team and stop moaning.
That lads about 15 but he acts about 42 get a grip of yourself mate give yourself an aneurism before you turn 30
I wouldnt mind giving Dom a go as manager if im honest
It’s the same every week with Dom win or lose you get doom and gloom dom
Why have Dom on here such a miserable c##t
Youre fucking kidding you lot are in a relegation battle and need all the 3 points you can get, Sahko fuxking saved you
damn.. and i thought Real Madrid fans are suspect as fuck.
COYI. Love how this has made #33 on trending too lmao 😂
West ham must do a roaring trade at the burger van......
He is not a fan, who gives a fuck we are a team with 4pts from 6 games, would you rather we lost?
I'd try an Hope get Ancelloti in quick time
Dom is such a twat. It's 3 points well deserved as we dominated the game by creating more chances and shots than Swansea who are didn't have a clue. Stop being negative bilic in.
Massive sigh at the end said it all. There were some positives at the very end and hopefully we can start with those players in the next game.
Until West Ham spend the big money and get better players managed by a world class manager we'll be stuck on this hamster wheel forever.same old shit casual play but the goal gets the whole team out of jail.
Why so many Pikeys follow West Ham?
I agree. Can't feel as excited as usual after a win because Bilic is still there and I feel he cannot take us any further. We were awful again but same as usual Bilic had no clue how to set up the team. No style of play. We have about 5 players up top waiting for it to be launched forward and we are fucking around with it at the back. Bilic clearly doesn't have instruction or game plan for the team. We need someone who will actually set the team up with some discipline and structure.
More performance art from Dom. it's all an act.
Sakho did celebrate he took his shirt off lol! he went mad! why take your shirt off , he got a yellow card!
I hate Sakho's attitude but I love west ham so I celebrated the fuck out of the goal.\nDom is right about the win papering over the cracks though. We may have been better off in the long run getting the draw if it meant Slav got the boot because as it stands he is just going to continue with his awful tactics and we are going to struggle like we have for the last year and a half.
We have a decent aquad but billic dont know how to get the best out of them...thats was a piss poor performance...even antonio played shit and ive never seen him play crap
If Bilic did go who would West Ham get I mean no managers about who will take that job... And him saying Swansea not a good side and West Ham are behave both shit teams.....
When will people relise that the deal was in place for sakho to leave the club had arranged it but then decided to stab sakho in back as they couldnt sign another striker then decide to blame sakho
Bilic just won the game you muppet. So fucking negative every week
A goal scored by West Ham is a goal celebrated by me even if Harold shipman was playing upfront
can we not give dom the job, with his attitude he would make me play like fucking messi
I'm not being funny, we messed up big time early doors this season. But we're still only 3 points off 7th.\nUnless we can get Benitez or Ancelotti, what's the point of changing manager?\n\nSo let's back the team if not him until we get a better manager.
Andy Carroll goals per game ratio is 0.28 goals per game. How is he allowed to play ?
This video was missing a 'chin up' at the end of it Nicky haha Dom looks like we've just been relegated out the championship to Millwall
Dom always looks like he’s got a bit of shit under his nose.
Met Nicky after the game today, brilliant lad, even got a picture with him 🙂
Well that was depressing, he has a point about Bilic though.
Mate ATM it doesn't matter how we get the 3 points as long as we do
Anyone else spot Ethan / bazinga from sidemen
Such a important win ffs , don't matter how they come when your struggling at the bottom, and I hear a lot of fans today at the match including this fat mug Dom saying he would rather us lose so Bilic goes ........ one word and that is CUNT
Bilic gotta go
Dom cracks me up haha
He's a morbid cunt
Spot on, don't like the man. His attitude is piss poor.
down. fuck we all hope so you PICKEY SCUM....................................................
Win papers over the cracks bilic out we will not get top 10 with this man in charge
Spot on from Dom, as for not celebrating the goal thas just petty mate last minute goals are the cream of goal celebrations lol
I see hear what you saying Dom\nBut we all know if it was a cup final against with the  drinks flowing n Sakho scores 95th min  winner ...  You would be going mental 😂
Dom just shut the fuck up, call yourself a West Ham fan , always fucking moaning . We won the game don't need your negativity. It weren't pretty but we are struggling. Not cheering your team ffs Just go away
caravan scum.
Completely agree with Dom
Why so many ugly fat West Ham fans. Fat ugly bastards LOL. Vocabulary of the East End sewer rats. Feck this and Feck that and nothing Feck all else LOL. West Ham hop picking holidays are what these fat bastards need.
I love the hair !!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ so fun
You're hilarious and I love your personality
The mascara wand reminds me of a very popular Japanese mascara brand called Fairydrops :)
Auntie Jackie, I need for you to go on #insecure bc you and Issa Rae are twins & both freaking hilarious!!!
I really agree with you on adding five more deep shades
well yaknow milk is white so it's no surprise that Milk Makeup is whyte af
When an ad comes on in the beginning and you decide not to skip it so Mama Jackie can get that COIN GUUUURRRRLL
we need more darker shades for the dark skin beauties
This is my absolute favourite look on you. You have absolutely beautiful smooth skin so minimalistic makeup looks on you enhance everything even more than your more usual looks. Either way you look good, but I loveeee this look so much.
what brush did you use for the becca bronzer?
is the eye vinyl comfortable on the eye or is it sticky once it settles in? It looks bomb so I'm wondering if it's worth these coins
I really loved how this look turned out Jackie! I like this glossy lid concept. When I sampled this foundation I ended up looking super red! :(
You are hilarious and completely gorgeous, thanks for great the insight and laughs! 😄
I got the foundations through Influenster and I really like them, no complaints.
I do believe that the entire milk product line was made to achieve the dewy minimal look rather than the  bold look, considering also that it’s a Korean brand, makes sense why it’s not matte and really light on blush
I would like to say this to you as a woman to woman courtesy and I know I would want someone to tell me especially when they see I'm being as fly as you. I think your makeup would be applied perfectly if your sideburns were trimmed down. From a viewer's point of view unfortunately we see the makeup catching onto your hair.
I gasped when you put on that berry lip...it looks gorg on you, especially with that olive turtleneck
I love your curl , I videos with your natural because have a similar curl pattern . I just be like girrrrrr my hair is rey Be poppin ‼️😻 #TeamNaturalHair
the lipstick is super pretty damn
You and Tati are the ONLY people who review products honestly. At least that I have seen so far. Thank you! And you have a new subscriber!
the only silicon sponge that works as a bomb applicator is the eSpoir Tight Touch Sponge its $5 and resembles a cushion puff but silicon. Just have to get over the noise it makes as you're beating that beautiful face
Foundation kind of  looks like Lumi from Loreal.
Can I have your light shades? I'll pay you I'd you want
I can’t she said y’all can knock off five DOLLARSsssss!!! Lol love her💜💜💜
I agree Jackie. If a brand can spend that much time perfecting pale shades they should do it for deeper skin tones as well point blank. If they don’t have the money to produce them then simply do half lighter shades and half tan and deeper shades. That doesn’t make sense to me. I’m pale as shit and that drives me to drink. Especially when I have clients with deeper skin tones and when I need to find stuff from a certain brand I like, I can never find it 😤😤 anyways love you jackieeeee you’re amazing 😍❤️
Jackie the foundation is not friendly 😫😫😫😫💯 can someone say Fenty Beauty please 🤗
Jackie a while back you gave your tip for how you let your concealer sit for a bit before blending and ever since I started doing that most of my concealers are working SO much better for me. Thank you so much for being such a wonderful YouTuber and bringing wonderful reviews and tips.
I swear that you are the cutest, craziest soul!!! is it crazy that I dance with you when you sing you Theme song??? LOL   #ILoveIt
WHYYYYYYYY IS IT SO DAMN GREASYYYYYYYYY....lawddd I've never been so on edge watching your video ever...lol
I'm so glad I came across your channel. Everyone seems so serious compared to you, love how you keep it real..
go 'head with your chick-bones then
Makeup companies need to step up their game. So everyone can use and enjoy them. Milk better watch this
I don't like MILK now. I'm still going to use the blurring primer stick... it's,  my fav...
tbh why do you wear false lashes lol your lashes are thebomb.com
This makeup line seems like a hot mess. Girlfriend made it work, but ain’t a thing that cover girl couldn’t do and saved her 900.00
OMG your skin !! I can't even ! Just slap on falseys ,mascara and you'll be bootiful! Even though makeup is fun and always makes a statement, you don't need it you are beautiful
I am LIVING for this shirt!
Jackie is the real tea 🙌🏽🙌🏽
i feel like these products are meant to be so minimalistic and for wear without foundation
you were killing me in this video lol literally irritating that i should i have to laugh this much watching a makeup tutorial ! great review, you look great
Girl your curl pattern is sooooo gorgeous! 😍😍 I love it.
Wow... I can’t believe you called that under-eye stick FAT! I thought you were all about inclusion... #FatLivesMatter \n\n(this is CLEARLY a joke just in case someone tries to come for me when I didn’t send for you... stay seated, thanks)
I’m new and I like her already
How many people search he need some milk after this? Lol
Yes, gurl! You are a lot and I’m loving every bit of it!!! 😍😘
Silly sponges are made to SPREAD the product, then you blend and press it into the skin with the beauty blender. SPREAD, you save product when you SPREAD honey why is every beauty guru troubled when they r not using their silicone correctly????
If it washed up on shore you'd think about using it. I just love you. 😂😂❤️
😂 ... I'm one of the dedicated ones!
You are hilarious 😂 I love your personality !
I can't think of the last thing i bought that you didn't preview. So helpful
A) you're gorgeous and B) I adore your personality.
I love the being
I really like your hair, it looks so so adorable
Does the rolling stamping/motion you use for your forehead blending seem to help any? My forehead is an oil slick 24/7 and noting seems to help -_-
Your sense of humor is too funny! I love it. I love your reviews because of your honesty. Take care Jackie!
You def transferred my call girl lol
this literally won’t stay out of my recommendations LOL
I love you Jackie but me no likely that Milk on you. It's not looking like its for 'us'. Thank you for the review.
Ewwwwwww idk why but glosssy eyes look nasty it looks like you had a pink eye and puss is oozing out of your eye thumbs this up if you think it looks  weird but love you gurl just don’t like the glossy look
Milk uses the whole natural no cake thing as an excuse for no coverage or pigment .
#FAIL for MILK! Watching these products was like nails scratching on glass. They should be ashamed
oh my god its in my lashes ITS IN MY LASHES
Damn, I don't even wear makeup and I'm subscribing, 😂😂😂
I keep my cooling stick in the fridge. Unfortunately I wake up with puffy eyes.
Can you review fashion nova makeup
I dunno if I can swear here...but I fucking love you. Make me laugh my ass off every time and legit best tutorials evahs.
I love your unbiased opinion! Review the Lara Lee palette please?!! I have seen quite a few reviews already but I feel like it's pretty basic and most people are biased! I trust your opinion for dark skin girls (I am more caramel).
The eye pigments and mascara seems pretty dope though.
Just discovered you today... I laughed so hard watching you! I can't wait to see more!💕
Ima need milk to add some chocolate.
They need some work on both ends of the spectrum they don't have anything light enough for me or anything dark enough for my best friend
“Do you think I really want full coverage?! No! Duh!” LMAO
I always have a hard time finding shades in foundation, I'm too olive... It's always too yellow, orange or too dark... Give me an in between!!!
You should do some fun Halloween makeup looks
I used the cooling water wrong and it broke me out and I had to return it, but i low key want it back
Just discovered your channel.. my goodness I love you already! Binge watching every single video currently ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😭😭😭😭
HE NEED SOME MILK 😭
Have you tried to use raw Shea Butter to moisturize instead?
Just smashed that button for the second time
My god this look is actually so gorgeous on you I love the lip and simple eye
Omg I love you❤️
Chile.... this was stressful 😩
U r hillarious!!! I luv it!!
this look
Issa noooooooooo 👎🏾
Hahahaha ‘it feels like sweat! 💦 ‘

Tbh I love your brows
PAUSE AT 1:01 died 😂😂
Those glossy lidsssssss YES
Simonzia you need some milk 😂😂
I NEED UR LASHES.
gurlll tht title had me chokeing on my drink
I am loving the look at 17:20 but I like a less glam, simple, natural but more polished look. I know it isn't your typical, elegant, style, but I believe you look beautiful regardless. \n\nI think I'll take a look at their stuff regardless, but I definitely think a similar look can be done with cheaper products, though I really like these formulations.\n\nEdit: I love the look at 20 min too and the light blush and the Mars highlighter.
Always happens to me.
Do you work in agents of shild because yo see exacly like  honter
This always happens to me, mostly at church, people don't ask me to hold the door, but I just always feel like I should hold the door for people

Hey, I need your help for a study I'm doing on comedy and politics! This survey takes only about 2 minutes and it would help me a lot if you took the time to fill it out. Thanks :) https://goo.gl/forms/rHi3ZzyA3WRCcXL13
Boycott the NFL!  I will always love our Soldiers more than a bunch of millionaires who beat women and try to impregnate and give STDs to as many of them as possible. Blacks & whites overwhelmingly get along. We have to stop letting the following groups from trying to divide us and from destroying America; Establishment Politicians, Main Stream Media, Corporations, and the Deep State.
LOVE SEEING MY ARAB PEOPLE GETTING RICH OFF YOUTUBE

That's what people told me when I brought two dumbbells some time ago and now I have also a squat bar and gained 5 kg..
Never seen a channel go as down hill as CollegeHumor and Smosh did
Why not just get a gym membership? Id get bored doing the same machine all the time....
I can go with this.
The excellent production value makes this shine! Did you take the music from somewhere or is it an original creation? And I don't know how you did the text on the walls, but bravo!
i dont remember the word pajama looking like that
Where's the damn phone number!!! I desperately need this man!!
Hello, I recently started my humouristic channel. It would mean the world to me if you could give me a chance
Hey guys, remember when College Humor was actually funny? I know, I almost forgot they were too
Lower the volume of the background music. It was a bit too loud
Where do I buy this?
This was hilarious, because it hit way too close to home. My mom has an ab lounger that she's never taken out of the box. I'm so used to it partially blocking the hallway that I step around it subconsciously. It's a really great cat pedestal.
Epic voice and theme is epic.
Why do people hate working out? I can never get it.
I miss it even though it was 4 years ago...
Illuminati A\nI believe!
Actually this machine is pretty cool.
You're so cute. Can we go on a date?
My dad uses it for a hanger at his house
College humor has really fallen from grace
Isn’t it pyjamas and not pajamas?
Guy with pink nipples is just weird. I know it’s quite common among Caucasian’s because I dated a few pink white girls, but I just can’t imagine how it feels to be a guy with pink nipples...
it's funny because it's true!!!
They way this ad was made make me want to buy it..
I'd fucking buy this thing immediately
Why didn’t I get this in my sub box
If you wear Jordan shorts and an X-Large Nike short nobody will notice you don't workout.
I this a joke
Cant relate. I love working out.
Exercise clothes make the best pajamas
I hope everyone saw the Illuminati symbol on “You hate working out”
My home gym consist of a squat rack, bench, barbell, dumbells, dip belt, and an arm blaster. I love working out regardless of where sometimes I’ll even run to the park just to exercise.
*looks at gym equipment gaining dust*\nI should work out again.......\n\nI'll start tommorow
This is a funny idea and is totally true, so why am I not laughing. I've been wondering about this in their last few videos.
So where could I get this from again?
is it just me or has Pat becum more hawt over the years
Hi I'm Roge ... oh wait, you stole his video
Most machines are ass, they don't build stability muscles. I prefer to lift my own American stomach fat up and down.
Fighter Workout Tip: End of the day you only NEED two things. Nice set of reasonable weight dumb bells (10 for newer folks, 20-25 goal. Higher if bigger person) and a really durable heavy bag. That and some god damn discipline is all you need to not only get your body in order, but do so in a way that gives you a very natural build. Nothing overly stressful, very little chance of injury unless you're a fucking imbecile, and exceptionally relaxing afterwards. I'm telling you, NOTHING like just going apeshit on a heavybag to make a shitty day a bit better. Put in what you want to get out. 5-10 minutes a day, or a few hours. You got that shit either way.
I thought the machine could talk and would insult you as you used it
Intruding into a No Flex zone?\n\nThey knooooow better. They knooooow better.
This is so accurate it's making me rethink my life
I legit thought this was keith from try guys
Before you watch this, here is the answer to the video's title:  Don't
I actually thought this was an ad and tried to skip it
How long till we get another troopers episode,love the skits yall do but would love to seen another episode of troopers.
Yes! That is exactly right! \nEveryone, please watch my little nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
Finally an episode that is not liberal propaganda.
GRANT, YOU'RE TOO FUCKING TALL!
Grant is so hot 😂😍
Just Give Us Your Fucking Money!
this videa is awesome, snl quality all the way, you are great collegehumor
I feel like CH made this video specially for me and it´s their way to tell me to move my fat ass to the gym...
… \n\nI know it's supposed to make fun of his height..\n\nBut with all those freeballing shots in his underwear.. \n\nI think it was just to see his bulge..
You should do an it themed skit but for adults and it represents what adults are afraid of and it's commitment being sober and debt
I'm too embarresed to try new machines at the gym so I just do treadmill and leave
I just don't know how I lived without this. :)
This channel is going to shit
This is so true
Thought this was a new idubbbz video from the thumbnail :'(
It's the first time that thhe writer didn't do the outro!!! What happened?!?! :OO
Lol! I'm bigger than that guy and I'm 15 years old.
This was too real to be funny
This video helped me find an excuse to stop working out at the gym 😉
You're saying you *don't* use them as sex toys?
He put the lightbulb in, while there was still electricity coursing threw it.
Why is this not a marketing campaign already?
It would have been just as funny without the profanity.
Makes me want to buy one just for all those purposes
Grant just wanted to be shirtless
this needs to be a real  commercial
Who ever did the voice kinda sounds like John Cena
Finally. College humor made a good video
Um, no...
CollegeHumor has become UnmotivatedAdultHumor
Goddamn Grant 💦💪😍😍🤤🤤💦💯😍🤤😍👅😛👅👅😏💦💦👉👌👀👀👌😩💦💯💯💦💦💦💦👅🤤🤤🤤😩💦💦💪😍💯 D🅰️DD🇾😏💦💦👉👌👀💯😍🤤😍💪💪💯💯👅😩💦👅D🅰️DD🇾😏👉👌👀😛😛😛👀👌😩😩💦💪💪💪D🅰️DD🇾💦💯😍🤤💦👅💯

Can totally imagine how ayla will be able to control and wrap issac ard her little finger when she grows up. Haha. Issac is the sweetest older brother.
Because life happens you tell them girl thank you for keeping it real!
Dude the struggle of being asian is they are sooo forward. At first you're taken back almost and sooo close to being offended but at the same time you're like ehh💁🏻 that's just super normal and you can't do anything about it haha
Awe, I was just in Hong Kong! But now I'm back in the US. Isaac is so cute so is Ayla 😊😊😊 I hope to meet you all someday!
wow get you a guy who would pick up your soiled underwear for you and still love you
oh man i had stomach flu while oregnant with twins and i felt so awful , i bent over to pick up my sons toy and i had a long tunic on and long story short it rained hot lava down on an innocent village of legos...and one smurf...thank god i was at home
Isaac Has Such Good Manners 😭😭❤️ You And Tim Are Doing An Amazing Job With Him
Asian people are just really into everyone being skinny, if your on a chubby side they think something is wrong with you, and that you're the ugliest person in the world...I gained 20lbs and my entire family never fail to remind me how fat I am and they will mention it whenever they get a chance and think it's ok that it's normal, mind you I'm 140lbs right now I'm not even that big, but it makes me feel horrible about my self that's why I sometimes avoid to see them...
😭😭😭 i can relate, girl. Unfortunately.
That baby is so big! I want to pinch her cheeks so badly!!!!!!
Isaac is so polite and the cutest child I have ever seen in my life. God bless your wonderful family bubz. I love you guys
No worries in 32 and pooped in my sleep luckily I was home
I once was at a theme park and went to the bathroom and then proceeded to walk around for 20 minutes with a seat cover Stu k in my pants lol it's okay girl embarrassing things happen all the time, it just makes a good story for later!
Don't worry, it happened to me... And my bf also, had a good laugh.
Girl you are beautiful, don't let the remarks about your weight get to you. Just focus on being healthy and happy.
Thank you Bubz for these “little doses of happiness.” Even when I’m in a dark place I can click your videos and immediately smile and laugh. So grateful to have been here through the years 💕☺️
I was drinking hot chocolate at 5:24 😐
I've been watching your beauty & vlog channels for years and something I've always been fascinated with is your beautiful skin!! please give me your skin!
I also show my mom your vlogs, she smiles every time she sees the kids and kept laughing at your story of meeting tims grandma! Bubz grandmas nickname is grandma bubz so what is tims grandmas nickname? Grandma hubz?😃.
Filipinos are super direct, as well... It's a blessing and a curse. You're beautiful, Bubz. <3
Is... is Ayla's head actually as big as Isaac's??
Not just a Chinese thing, its an Asian thing xD My aunt kept calling me fat when when it's time to eat she always gives me a large amount of rice and sides.
if you guys really rent the house, i just might go to HK to purposely rent there LOL
17 KILOS?! THAT'S SO MUCH!! She should've be like 'that's so much weight....that you LOST' because it is!!
Tim is so cute haha 😀😊
What bathtub do u use for Ayla bubz?
Wow I never realized how much I missed your hong kong apartment and stuff. It's so nostalgic xD
oh god i was eating my meal when i start hearing bubz talking about her 'accident' i had to stop eating LOL! my brain was just visualizing what happened >.< LOL!
Don't feel bad Bubz. I did it today when I sneezed. At least I was at home but, I had to throw away my favorite under wear. I knew you wouldn't like that because you used to hoard your underwear. lol So don't feel bad. Your hubby can get the car detailed. No worries.
I wished the directness of Asian families were limited to directing comments to family members only. I cannot even try to count the amount of times I wanted to dig a hole and bury myself in the ground when my grandmother called my friends fat or not pretty. Thank you for sharing that with the world I makes me feel a little better that my grandmas not the only one who does it.
THE HONG KONG KITCHEN GIVES ME FEELS
lindy. I did have period incidents which was awfully sad and bad. I understand you might have felt bad but it already happened you can't go back to past. It'll be alright. Take care.
Bubz you are such a cool mum... !
Haha Cubans are direct too! The first thing they say is, Omg you're so fat! Or You're too skinny, you need to eat!
Isaac is such a lovely boy
Bubz!! You guys seem so much happier in Hong Kong! I hope you guys are able to stay for a while! 💗
Awk tim is so sweet😩 get you a man like tim ;)
I guess you can call it a crappy situation XD Sorry I'll let myself out lol I'm sorry you had to go thru that  that's so embarrassing. Hope you feel better <3
Had a moment looking back of seeing baby Isaac having a bath , but quickly remembered it's really Alya instead 👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻
I'm sorry bubz but I choked with laughter. I can just imagine the scene. The car must've smelt real bad.... 🙂
It's okay,  we've all been there. I hope you feel better.
I love how bubz went from introducing make-up sponges to baby shower sponges hahaha
Bubz! Dont you worry about your weight! You are perfect the way you are! ♥️
Awww Bubz! \nThings happen! I also have pooped myself twice, which is super embarrassing! >.<
Korean culture is that direct too.
My husband is biracial. The first time I met some of his older Chinese family, they started giving me dieting and exercise tips almost as soon as I introduced myself. I just sat there smiling like 😅\nMy hubby saved me though, by changing the subject haha
I am so glad you are okay...I was in an accident once, wasn't even hurt, and I cried...
And people went off at Tim for not being willing to oil your perineum.... but this was true love!!! No longer can YouTube comments say he doesn't love you and isn't a great husband!!
so excited for this channel to reach 1 million <3
You're so real I love it 😂 x
i read isaac's shirt wrong :) i thought it said 'my mummy is chaotic' but it says 'my mummy is magic'
Your fine the way you are!! Your beautiful. Dont let others get you down
Does anyone know whether there is an issue with the weight of Ayla? She seems hugely puffy. Is that normal or was that addressed in a prior vlog?
Hi bubz I'm from hong kong😀❤
Watching your vlogs makes me miss hong kong even more, especially bc you live in the same area 😭😭😭
Isaac is so cutteeeeeee. I havent watched in a while I love how much hes talking
Bubz, just to make you feel better... it happened to me as well and i`m 27! I was walking from point A to point B for 20 minutes and was dying to go to the toilet but couldn't find one. You`ll be fine ;)
Awww bubz!  Everyone has sh*t themselves once or twice.  Usually its a mistaken fart!  😂😂😂😂😂
Don't worry about it bubz, it's actually more common than you think. Once your pelvic muscles have recovered and strengthened it will be fine. Also I know what you mean about the culture difference. In Uganda relatives will be very direct and outspoken on things like weight (but then expect you to eat a lot too haha)
So I'm flying to Hong Kong tomorrow ahaha ummm
Hahahaha the same thing happened to me bubz! Lol and IT WAS AT SCHOOL! But luckily nobody was there because it was outside the toilet in class time ;) was still kinda embarassing lol
Why you need to go to HK this often?
Lol was walking with my grandma the other day and she goes time to lose weight and I went me or you?  (jokingly) and she replies obv not me. Im already skinny enough 😂😂 gotta love Chinese folks
Try a comotomo bottle. That’s what I used when I was breastfeeding my son and would feed him expressed milk. It’s large and kind of mimics the breast. It also has a silicone body so who ever is feeding baby can gently squeeze it and it will mimic milk let down.\n\nI got mine on amazon. Here is a link. \n\nComotomo Natural Feel Baby Bottle, Pink, 5 Ounces https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004C053B0/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_3yj0zbXFJ75WW
LOL it's not embarrassing but it is funny!\nWe all get sick, it happens.
I had one of those accidents in a mall once... it was terrible
my boyfriend broke up with me ( we were together for almost 4 years) and i'm so broken. thanks for the smile through my tears :,)
No shame bubz! It happened to me once when I had the stomach flu at a friends house, one of the worst days eveeeer!
Lmfao!!! Lindy good luck next time with the toilet 😂😂😂😂
hey! I’m a new youtuber Just released a new video on my channel - would love if anyone could check out and subscribe and I’ll do the same back! Xx
Relationship goals, crapping your pants and your s.o not giving a shit. What a cuties you all are! <3
That happened to me after having my son!!! Don't feel bad! I was mortified at first but now I laugh. It's can be a part of having a baby. Don't be embarrassed!! You'll laugh about it later.
Aww loved Isaac's shirt My mummy is MAGIC <3 <3 <3
Bubz, little question : where did you bought that cover (when you were breastfeeding Ayla in restaurant)? Thank you for answer in advance :)
What are those sponges called? I need to get them for my niece. She's chubby like Ayla. Haha
Isaac is the sweetest! Asking you if you're not well 😭 what a sweetheart!
I kinda knew she was going to say sge pooed herself before I even watched the video. 😂😂
How you know you're an adult = When you accidentally poo yourself.\n\nSeriously, everyone does it. Don't worry Bubz.
YOU GOT SO BIG\nMe: but she's so thin....
Also, you may not be the same size you were but you look beautiful and healthy!
Doesnt matter, she's magic. According to Issac's shirt that is ;P
The relief I felt when it wasn't something serious but at the same time the trauma I can't deal
Bubz there's no such thing as TMI on here we know nearly everything 😂
Just tell everybody that if you lose your baby weight too fast you re going to have suuuuper loose skin so you have to lose it slowly,plus you only gave birth two months ago so they should just let it go !
Its okay lindy xD you gave birth, I heard it weakens everything down below!\n\nAlso I wont tried to force a far to disgust my boyfriend and I sharted.. he just died of laughter
Those near misses seem to always happen to you in Hong Kong. It must be something you eat there that causes such an extreme reaction. Investigate and don't worry too much :*
It happens to the best of us. Haha i miss HK...
Issac is so cute. I died <3<3<3
This is why i love bubz😂 and its not just Chinese relatives even Indian relatives do that a lot.
Isaac <3
Oh my gosh Isaac is so well mannered! So cute!
OMG, BUBZ!
Awwwe I miss that apartment
you meant Japanese bbq, right?
Awwwh :( it happens i guess! :( bless you jahahaha
Bubz, I guess you could say shit happens.
<3
Sending love ❤️
I never laughed so much looool
i hope i can pop up with you in Hong Kong before you go away :) \nLast time I saw you was few years ago <3

This music video is great but it really is unfortunate timing to have machine guns shooting in las vegas. No way they could of known about the terrible event to happen just days after this video was released, i just hope the video doesnt trigger any ptsd in the victims or familys.
This has a nice feel good vibe to it

In all seriousness what are you and Oliver gonna do when addams is over 😔 yous still need to see eachother 😩🙏🏼
Hey Carrie, as a musical theatre student i am really intrigued  to know what your health regime is to keep your voice at its full potential every day of the tour. Any tips would be great! xx
I'm sure both Carrie and Oliver don't want to confirm whether they're dating or not until Addams is finished. They obviously don't want anything to ruin what they have at the moment ❤️
i'm so curious as to what oliver said now
Looks like you're having so much fun with this tour! I'm so glad for you!\nAlso would you maybe be able to slip into your next Watch Me Wednesday how you tie your LUSH knot wrap? I've seen a few different ways but it looks gorgeous on you xx\nHope you're keeping well xx
Carrie you should try micellar water to get your makeup off. works wonders!
Your vlogs are the absolute favorite part of my week!!!
still wishing i can watch you in singapore!! if only time allowed it.
Watch me Wednesday are my favorite videos!
These videos are always such a joy!
Carrie, where is that War Of The World's statue!??!
Where is 'It'swaypastmybedtime' she changed the name.
Bake off is legit the best way to end the night of shows. My husband and I do the same thing! Mary and Paul all day.
Your attitude and stance is just so great because I feel you are making unbelievably so much efforts so that everyone can understand what you feel :) it's impossible to do that without massive love to everyone. I always respect you girl! I really hope someday I can come to see you performing from Japan!! Love xxxx
since when did carrie rebranded, i don't really watch her that much but i was scrolling through my subscriptions and i was like wOAH when did this happen?
Hi Carrie, my girlfriend is a really big fan of yours and Ive tried to send you a letter but it got returned to me as the addressee wasn't there, is therr a time you will definitely be there to receive mail? Love the video btw!
Hi Carrie I saw you in chitty chitty bang bang  last year and the Adams family this year in sheffield. When I saw the the ads nd family Scott was playing uncle fester. After the show I went to stage door to  meet you but you didn't come out but I met Oliver and Samantha if was amazing,. I love your video you make me cry with laughter love you loads love from Grace xxxxx ❤❤❤
Oliver reminds me of Jack Harris a little bit
We are doing Addams Family for our school music. I’m trying out for puglsy, do you have any tips?
I love your videos! You're wonderful! xxx
The guy you were singing with on the stairs has taught me at my drama school loads!
I would love to see Scott as Fester but I'm a bit worried about Les! He has been off for ages. Hope he is doing okay. I'm seeing the show in Glasgow! Can't wait to see a vlog there if you do one ☻
I use to sing the song they were singing at the beginning with my choir, and I loved it :)
I love watching these... I literally watch these for the costumes so I can design costumes based off them for my production of Addams. Everything is so amazing here, thank you for showing us these Carrie. I know all of us in my production of Addams love your videos
Can't wait to see you perform in the Grand in October! I went to see the English Youth Ballet today and it was brilliant, then I bought tickets to see The Addams Family and I realised at half time that you were performing!! It was a great surprise
Hi Carrie. I saw you at the stage door today. I was the one that probably looked very nervous. (I was wearing a pink dress)\nI loved your performance. You were amazing!
I watched it today and it was amazing!! So glad I saw it!
All small YouTube's let's all help eachother out.sub to me and comment done. Then ill sub to you
I saw your show in Sheffield for my 7 year anniversary, you were amazing! I heard every word right from the back, and I thought you were the best singer by far.
My school's doing Addams Family this year, and I love watching these videos and hearing about your experience with the show. It's one of the reasons why I'm so excited to do it!
I'm so sad cause I was meant to be seeing it tonight but it turns out I can't come, and I really wanted to come see it cause the last time I saw you perform was in les mis and you're my favourite west end actress :(❤️❤️
I'm guessing you never know when you're going to stage door because I'll be seeing Addams family on Wednesday (oohhh) and I would love to see you at stage door but of course I get it if you aren't there
The warmup is always my favourite part of these vlogs
I came to the wednesday show in working with my school and you were absolutely incredible!!!!
ok im shocked by how long your hair has grown. i got used to seeing you with a wig or in a bun
I get so excited when a new video comes up! How many more Watch Me Wednesday's are there?
Awww I LOVE this video Carrie. I love watching the behind the scenes of all the work it takes to put on a touring theatre show omg xxx
i KNEW my hair was growing super slow compared to usually. You confirmed it coz I cut my hair about the same length shortly after you did. And I've been thinking that my hair has grown SO slowly than usual, and now I've been confirmed.
Hey guys please subscribe to my channel ❤️❤️
Awww Carrie watching you meet all the people at stage door made my heart so happy, one of my travel goals in life is to see one of your shows and hopefully meet you one day but WELL DONE THIS WAS A GOOD EPISODE ❤
I sat in the same seat that Oliver is in last time I went to the Sovereigns. Huh.. Oooh!. I went to see the show at 5 on Friday (29th) at Woking. You were amazing, Oliver was amazing, Scott was amazing. 'Full Disclosure', I loved it.
Your video is the 7 most trending video on YouTube atm!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
You & Oliver are actual friendship goals <3
Anyone else REALLY want to hear the inappropriate things that Oliver said? 😂
Why dafuq is this trending 6th, it has 56k views?????!!!!
Hahah I love the ending :'D
Aaah! I went to see the first show on Friday! I was like, middle, top in the audience. My mind is blown that you were filming somewhere I walk past several times a week. The sovereigns is a great pub - opposite the cycle shop on the corner and a walking distance from the station. I recognise the party shop because it's the shop which opens at weird times and is almost always empty. It's so weird! The chips \nin the sovereign are good tho! Anyway, the show was aammaazing!! If you guys haven't watched it, I suggest you do. It's amazing. My fave bit is whenever you pulled the creepy eyebrow slanty face thingy. Anyway, thank you again!! 😃😃
I am dying to fly to Singapore for the show!! But I live in Hong Kong (which is not that far if you consider Europe) and I have school :/ Will you be in the Singaporean tour? love you!  (also, will try to watch this ten times more to figure out what Oliver was saying) cheers x
I CANT WAIT for you guys to come to singapore :'')
I love that everyone has beer and then there's Carrie's wine glass hahahh that's absolutely me
I saw you in Cardiff Carrie and I'm seeing you again tonight, can't wait!! Break a leg to all!!
I would hope Captain America would be a bit more sure of himself 😂😂😂
Oliver trying an American accent sounds so much like Captain Jack Harkness omg
I love your friendship with everyone!! It’s so great to watch <3
I understand why but sometimes I'm so sad your channel is PG because I need to know what Oliver said in the pub
Carrie! Don't use wipes to get your makeup off. Use the Camomile Cleansing Butter from The Body Shop. It's not harsh on your skin at all and it gets rid off your make up very easily. It's also cruelty free and so much better for the environment than those wipes! x
Are you the only one from the original U.K. Cast going to Singapore? 🙃
Hunnyyy you’re hairs getting so long it’s gorgeous!!
Ah you went to my local! Good old Sovs.
❤Great video 😁 Please check out our small YouTube channel and subscribe if you like the content ❤
can't wait to watch you in Singapore!\nhope i can see you as well! I dont remember Mediacorp Theatre having a stage dooor
Are you actively trying to grow your hair out again or is it because too busy to get a hair cut? Also, loved seeing the after hours!
I’m really going to miss the Carrie and Oliver show when Addams Family is over. You guys make me giggle. 💕
Hi Carrie! Just a quick question for you and your cast mates. My school is starting our own production of the Addams family and I was thinking if any of you had any advice for playing your characters or tips for making things more fun/enjoyable in these cooky and spooky roles. If you do, I'm sure we'd love to hear from you amazing actors! Thank you and have a lovely day <3
CRAZY FOR YOU I FREAKED OUT WHEN I HEARD IT my friend was just in the musical
Carrie, did Oliver share the After Eights I gave him for you all on Thursday night at stage door? :D
UK stage doors are so chill I expected ear drum bursting screams but overall it was quite quiet
I'm sure you've already tried it but coconut oil is amazing at getting make up off. :)
Ooh are you going on tour to Singapore too? That's exciting! :D\nSo looking forward to seeing the show in Glasgow!
I have to say it's weird to watch you be at my home town! Also sovereigns is definitely one of the nicer pubs in woking! Watched the show on Tuesday so didn't see you at stage door
So many media interviews will leave you PRESSED for time!
You are so sweet at the stage door! A true inspiration. I would love to meet you one day!
I'm two subs away from 425 PLEASE help me reach it, I ONLY NEED 2 MORE SUBS!!\n\nCHEERS GUYS!
She's like our own little celebrity! Lol xoxo
My mum came up to Bristol last weekend to see the show with me on Sat evening, it was bloody amazing! Thank you so much to you and the rest of the cast for putting on an awesome show!! Big love <3
Omg I love the ending 😂❤
Did anyone else notice the kissing-sound around 6.58 or was that just me????
Watching you Scott and Oliver just makes me happy 😊 ❤️ xx
Hey I saw you tonight in Woking and you were absolutely insane. Keep doing what you’re doing because you and the rest of the cast were incredible xxxx
without sounding too much like regina george, I LOVE your jumper, where did you get it? (but seriously, the grey one, I love it).
Why are the running times announced after the show?
Carrie to get your makeup COMPLETELY off invest in come cotton pads and micellar water. Properly wet 2 cotton pads with the micellar water and use that to take all of your makeup off like a makeup wipe, works a treat!! Xx
I remember the video, where you cut your hair! It is like yesterday, but no! Your hair is long again o. O
Carrie are you growing your hair long again (i was just wandering)\nP.s you were in the first les mis show my mum wached
Ollie is just the most precious gem ❤❤ i adore you both
I'm going to be subscribing to anyone who likes this comment and subscribes to my channel! Comment when done (legit)
Your hair is lovely!!!
I know Steven lol.
Bake off traitors 😛😉
Is Samantha womwick eg Ronnie Mitchell eastenders the mum
Oliver's dance omg
oh gosh, your poor skin! :D
What your funniest moment on stage
lol love it :)
Wonderful 🤗😘
<3
Did anyone else hear a kiss noise when there was the shot of fried eggs?
but wheres pete
It's so strange to me how stage door works for the west end. In almost any venue on broadway in New York,or on a tour,there's a barrier and the actor walks down the line and says hey to everybody.
Carrie you need to use coconut oil! It will melt your makeup off. Just scoop up a bit and massage it on and the makeup comes all off! Plus it leaves your skin nice and moisturized and leaves a nice base for anything you put on after
Poor guy looks so different now. I remember watching him with more youthful hair and less wrinkles.\nTime is truly powerful.
I see that with non-carbonated containers all the time. It happens whenever I fly to or from Denver, because of air-pressure difference.
West Wings my favorite show!
agree. i don't read end-of-world, dystopian books with shallow main characters anymore
I would like to propose an idea. YouTube is a large website with millions of people from around the world using it. My idea is to make a charity fundraising that would happen every year. A lot of money could be raised. I would like to purpose some ideas how it could work.\n\nFor donating and getting as many people to donate you could get some  prizes for example:\n-Discount or free YouTube Red(for 1 month, 2 months or even more)\n-Different color of your nick in the chat\n-Different YouTube layout or even the YouTube app icon.\n-Everybody that would donate could choose a Youtuber, which he/she would love to meet and a random person  would have opportunity to meet the chosen Youtuber.\n\nAlso during that day on the YouTube site nickname of the person who just donated would pop out. Maybe YouTube could even get sponsor’s that would give even more prizes.
This is a very interesting video about the engineering of the Aluminum Beverage can! And also how the can handles the pressure inside, and how the pressure reinforces the can! Enjoy!!!   \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUhisi2FBuw
TNG FTW
Agrreeeeeeeeeeeee
'Gritty Realism' is boring and sad.
My guess is that that can leaks gas but not liquid. I know its possible, but is it the case with this one.
We no longer live in a West Wing World. We live in a House of Cards World. Yup. Sick of it too. Thank you for this, whatever it's about.
Please please please! Watch Angel Beats! Hank please!\nIt is funny, serious, deals with death, life, disability, insanity, atrocious events, and the beauty of humanity. Please watch, please!
I work in corrections and I am so tired I hearing about the stories from the mind of a killer. The mind of a killer is boring and selfish. The mind of an good person is interesting and beautiful. I'd much rather be saturated in media about the every day person and the decent person as opposed to the seemingly endless books and movies about devious individuals. Don't give evil a platform. Loved this video.
Beer does the same thing if it freezes and then thaws.
If you're looking for funny, positive, nerdy, thoughtful storytelling, check out The Adventure Zone podcast!
I have really only seen the first season of ST:TNG all the way through (watched bits and pieces of all seasons as a child but it was lost on me until my adulthood where I am now just beginning season 2) and I think there are many great 'what is this about' moments in it including S1E1 with Q.
For anyone curious about aluminum soda cans https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUhisi2FBuw
Good picks
Been watching my way through both TNG and TOS, and you articulated exactly what I was thinking about Star Trek in general, especially in watching the last few episodes in season 3 of TNG. There's a depth to them that you really don't get in sci-fi stories anymore. I feel like Discovery has the potential to recapture this, but it also has the potential to go the way of plot-driven stories. We'll have to wait and see.\n\nAlso, have you seen any of Discovery, and what are your thoughts if you have?
How much rum is in that Dr. Pepper?
The Inner Light episode!!! (also high five for Measure of a Man) I too think about this episode. I think about it even when I don't realize that's what I'm thinking about. The first thing my hub said after we watched the first ep of ST DIscovery was wait, it's going to be serialize? And I hope, hope, hope that it's just because the first two episodes are prologue. Because you're so right. It's hard but it can be SUCH GOOD TV. Meanwhile, Hank, I salute you from afar good sir.
it sounds like maybe i'm not the only who responds to people asking me about a show/book/movie/game that i like first with what the themes are rather than what the plot is. it's about fate and destiny and what roles we try to fill and what we can do if we break the norm!! and also, it's about a duck that turns into a girl that turns into a magical ballerina to fight evil, i guess??
I love startrek. My philosophy teacher used to have us analyze the episodes and find the meaning and the lesson.\nMade a boring subject a lot better.
This is why I don't really enjoy Mr. Robot, or at least the several episodes I sat through before giving up.
Time to watch The Expanse!! There's your informed sci fi
did you just call a soda can, coke?
I wasn't feeling any urgency to read Turtles All the Way Down until this video. I feel now that I /need/ to read it. Now I know what it is about. Thank you, Hank (and John!)\n\nAlso, West Wing ❤️
Isn’t the title supposed to tell me what the video is about?
This reminds me of the collection of star trek next generation that I had. That's got destroyed by water damage from superstorm sandy
this is why i, as someone who wasn’t old enough to watch tv in the early two-thousands and late nineties, watch almost exclusively tv shows that were popular then, like ER and West Wing, etc.
Can anyone sub to my channel?
I'm still a part of the west wing world!
Exactly! Omg, If only I could explain that to everyone who thinks that stories are only as good as the action and situation. SIgnificance is the SOUL of everything!!\nI would for-real give my life so that everyone could understand that
Can I recommend The Orville?
How is inequality a problem exactly? Please explain why you are hurt if I produce more than you.
Not only are stories about how bad the world is and how awful people are boring, they're also unrepresentative and not terribly useful. As you guys like to point out from time to time, by many metrics things are as good for humanity now as they have ever been, and things are generally getting better. That doesn't happen without a lot of good people directing the efforts of their lives in beneficial, productive ways. The people who do bad things steal the limelight and are very well-publicised because what they do is outrageous and emotive, but in fact, that too is a testament to the ongoing progress, and the ongoing victory, of the right and the good; the bad stuff wouldn't stand out otherwise.
I finished watching TNG a few months ago and am two episodes away from finishing DS9. They are both fantastic series! I am so glad I decided to watch them.
It's not a Coke can, it's a soda can :D
My personal favorite What's it About? TNG episode? \nTapestry (s06e15)\nSuch a good message about owning past mistakes and appreciating how they make us who we are.\nNot for nothing, but you may have heard of the episode's writer. Dude named Ronald D Moore.
This sometimes happens when the drink freezes part way. Not enough to puncture the can, but enough to stretch it just a little. The can needs some pressure to keep its shape. Non carbonated drinks in a can are pressurized with nitrogen because it keeps the can rigid and doesn't react with the drink like the oxygen in air would.
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v67V3KtaSno
What about a can of apple juice! Do they use a stronger can?
We were never the West Wing world nor House of Cards world.
The Borg was one of the best created alien species ever created!
I miss these so much like just old school talkin' about shit Vlogbrothers videos.
I was very happy to find that your first pick of suggested episodes is my favorite. Drumhead is deeply moving and deeply important I implore everyone to watch it.
now i want you to play with a can of something non-carbonated.  like lemonade or something
Any friends of desoto in the audience?
YESYESYESYESYESYESYESYES. YES. YEEEEEEESSSSSSS. THAT'S WHAT STORIES ARE! THAT'S WHY THEY MATTER SO MUCH! THANK YOU HANK
It’s about clickbait

Ugh, and here I was just about to gut the meaning in my own stories so I could actually write them. But now I'm gonna have to go back and make the stories about more than a bunch of mercs shooting another bunch of mercs in space.
we are storytellers. write your book
Botulism can cause cans to have indents- just a head up
I think it's bacteria inside the can that could have given you food poisining
no longer the west wing world but the house of cards world. wowowowwww that was deep
Could you make a video on why your vids are alsays on trending with such low view counts
USES Coke AS A GENERIC TERM FOR ALL SODA POP\nI am so triggered right now.
Only on youtube would you worry about racism in space. Does youtube pay big youtubers to be dumbasses?
Orville or ST: Discovery... What's your preference?
I LOVE THIS VIDEO. I work hard to make all my art about something.
bf works at coke. says it doesn't have CO2 in it (which is used to make the bubbles)
Watch The Orville.  It is far from perfect, but it is a lot TNG.
I really miss the native hope in scifi. So often it's like the writers are laughing at their own premise are think that self-deprecating \n humor is the only way to seel the genre or show. I miss the genuine thoughtfulness of old scifi and the faith in humanity that it portrayed.
Could not disagree more that stories REQUIRE some deeper meaning. I always just look for stories that depict consistent characters, i.e. believable characters. I think you discover more about humanity, and yourself in turn, when you see how different people think and act. I think having a story to drive home some moral/political lesson as the most part always ends up poorly.
I'M NOT ALONE! If a show/movie/book/or even a youtuber is all about how bad the world is or people doing evil things with no deeper message, I am done with it too! I always felt like the odd one out not liking House of Cards and similar things. I don't want to add that kind of negativity to my life! I want my downtime to make me feel better about the world or help evolve my worldview! Thank you Hank for putting this into words and telling the world. I'm inspired to be truer to myself without being ashamed. Thank you ❤️. \n\nNerdfighteria helps me so much with random things like this, and is an example of the kind of content you outlined as the best, only it is an entire community too.
But you can get apple and orange juice in cans and they aren't carbonated?
Watch Master of None !!
Check out The Orville, I wasn't planning on watching it because I don't enjoy Seth Macfarlane but it's actually a really good show. It has a Interesting set of characters, once you get past the first episode it's awesome.
Why doesn't this always happen to cans of noncarbonated canned beverages like Hawaiian punch?
The Beast System is the Church System... All Church's,Any Denomination, They all are part of the beast system.God Calls us to be the Church. THE CHURCH SYSTEM IS THE STRONG DELUSION.  Pastors feed sheep polluted bread so they continue to look for spiritual highs.. Many People when Jesus comes are gonna say didn't we do miracles didn't we heal or cast out demons but Jesus is gonna say depart from me I never knew you because you were told that God's Law was the Old covenant and that going to Church on Sunday is sufficient to go-to Heaven. THE CHURCH SYSTEM ANY CHURCH IS A LIE. GOD WANTS US TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS!!! COME OUT OF CHURCH AND RELEGION AND INTO GOD'S LOVING ARMS!!
Some of my faves off the top of my head: Measure of a Man, Darmok, Chains of Command, Time Squared, The Nth Degree, Tapestry.. oh there's too many to choose.
Dr Pepper: An intellectual drink, for the chosen ones! (Who knows what show I’m referencing?!)
TNG was my star trek.😌
WHAT IS THIS VIDEO ABOUT?
Voyager is 100x better then all the other series combined.
coke=pop=soda
I completely agree with you, these are the stories that keep me hooked. Two of these I have recently enjoyed: Sherlock (I know, late to the party) which is about the struggles of relating to each other even when the others capacity is lacking (be it emotionally or intellectually) and also how to cope with our own otherness (healthily and unhealthily). And then I went to the cinema to see Wind River (would highly recommend) which is about family, and how to be a family when the world takes it away from us, and how we can fight and be strong and still lose. And how that has to be ok, and we can still be considered strong! And how we can still keep living, even if we are broken!

I thought Hank was about to do the Magic trick called healed and sealed
you should totally watch the orville
Themes, Meaning, and Carbonation
Wow! I just realized this is a lot of the reason I tend to hate the synopses on the backs of books. Because they always tell you (maybe too much) about the plot, and never what the book means. Like I always get a little miffed when I read a really good book and go back and look at the synopsis and it makes the book sound so ordinary and shallow
Steven Universe.
Permission to speak freely sir?\n Space... The final frontier...These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission: To explore strange new worlds...To seek out new life; new civilizations...To boldly go where no one has gone before!
It might be the other way around i.e. it's because the coke can is cold... so more gas dissolves in the liquid. If it was hotter the gas would dissolve more easily into the liquid.
Hank, I would loved to know if you have seen Mother! and your thoughts on the film.
Quick way to get the video trending lol
I am also tired of watching TV shows that are just dark and I do not care about any of the characters
I'm deeply bothered by the fact that Hank just called this a Coke when it's a Dr. Pepper....
YAS Next Gen 🖖 I'm going to be  Beverly for Halloween
THANK YOU for making this video.  A lot of movies and tv shows don't have a great plot (i.e. Moonlight - a friend of a friend literally said it was a movie where nothing happens and it made me SO ANGRY) but they are *about* something. I think projects like that are way more influential and its a shame that so many miss out because theyre looking for a plot
But ur cool and awesome
Shaka, when the walls fell.

AYEE
Lilly is SUCH a great human and we had so much fun filming together! Who do you want me to challenge next? :)
Not gonna lie... I let a lil squeal out when I saw Lilly 😍. Awesome Molly, so happy you got to collab w Lilly. She is such an amazing human being!
Where my Team Super Unicorns at???
Hahaha it was only Safiya Nygard that I guessed right, but only because the clip was her intro and I've heard that numerous times! Also, Lilly, I see dat #GirlLove Rafiki 2.0 👀
Awesome. I'd crash and burn in that challenge since I hardly know anyone on YouTube.\nJust watched the Lying about being sighted video from 8 months ago. You brought up points that really hit home. Although I can talk about my cPTSD, and even write a little from time to time, really coming to terms with having a worsening invisible and chronic illness comes with backward steps as well as forward. For what it's worth, it looks like there are more blind girl jokes than there are cPTSD jokes, but I'm adding to the list whenever I can. Now, I'm just working toward a fuzzy service beast, so at least membership in the chronic illness/disability club has perks.
honestly why don't you have more subscribers???
I got Liza and David so quickly😂😂 This was so good and fun to watch
I think Lilly should write a book called How to be a Bawse\n😂
lilly's love for ryan higa will never die
I HEARD THE DINKS AND INSTANTLY KNEW IT WAS JENNA AND JULIEN DINK FAM WHERE YOU AT
Been subbed for months. So I win! I was here befoooore.
How did she not get Yousef in like a second 😂
I got the Jenna & Julien Podcast one from the dinks... WHERE MY DINK FAM AT?!?!?!?!?!?!
When I heard dink dink I got so angry they didn't get it 😂
When you get real excited for J+J and then realized you recognized it from the Dink Dink, Jenna's whine, and Julien's voice in that order. Also H3H3????
this is the best collar ever !!! i recently started my own youtube channel and I'm so happy about it :)X
Are you 2 best friends???? awesome video as always!!!!
Oh my God I wasn't expecting this!!! Team super where you at???
Omg you two !!!!I am subscribed to both of you and i was so surpised that you've done a collab!!!
I got:\nGrace Helbig\nMarkiplier\nPhilip DeFranco\nMr. Kate\nRyanHiga
I GUESSED GRACE HELBIG INSTANTLY IM SO PROUD OF MYSELF
A Molly & Safiya collab would be great
Christine (simplynailogical) needs to collab with this girl, they would be perfect together. New sub, LOVE you so far.
WHY IS LILLY SO NICE!!!???
For the Jenna and Julien I new from the first second and I was shouting out JENNA AND JULIEN PODCAST!😂
You can do long hair competitions
omg i'm sooo bad with the voices lol
Lmaoooooo Lilly's face when Ryan's voice came on is me every time I see him!
Is that foundation on Lilly's jumper ? It's probably Molly's, I'm guessing they've hugged before the video 😂😂 and the way Lilly shows her face expressions forgetting Molly can't see them 😂 I love you two so much 💙💙 great video x
A voice challenge with the woman who made a freakout racist video over a single comment? I'd say she's more like Triggered Woman.
is she blind? plz respond i needs to know\nLol
OMG Lilly and Molly collab!!!  😍 yes, I was waiting for this for so long, I'm so happy... Now all I need is Safiya to join you 😁
I guessed Mark before lilly did ...... yay i got one.. only one
I've just been staring at the foundation on Lilly's sweater probably from hugging Molly haha x
Where's Logan Paul??
hello i am a christian
Molly & Lilly collab so well together! They should def plan future collabs together.
Please do this with Miranda Sings
how the fuck is this video trending with 28k views?
Molly you're so gorgeous! If you ever do a Q&A soon I was just wondering. Do you remember how you look? If not you're so gorgeous and your eye shadow is never flawed 😍
I kind of want to see her do this with Rebecca Felgate
i knew it was Alissa violet
Every time I here my mom watching a YouTube video I can automatically say who it is😂😂 it's bad
https://youtu.be/hoZ4P5TC0w8\n\n\nPlease put like on my video ))
I only got Ryan Higa, but I even knew it was from a video I watched recently (Dumbest Things I've Ever Done!)
I got all of them right.. I should play this challenge lol 😂 I live in YouTube
Loved the video and collab!!!
There are certain things about me I spoken of in the past to no validity....I'm reclusing to some of my other dormant traits....play time is over.
HOW COULD THEY GOT NOT GET MY SOME OF MY FAVES ELIJAH AND CHRISTINE ! Just kidding, love you both, this video is so great😂❤️
Even tho i realize there's potential issues with this idea.. but is there any way you could like... edit the audio clips ur listening to (of the voices) into the video?  Was hard to hear and i couldnt even really come close to having a guess. So was hard for me to play along.  That or i'm just really bad at this game.  lol.   I do realize you would either have to mute the audio of your recorded video, and replace w/the clips ur listening to, but then if you had commentary during the clip (which happens a lot) that would be muted.  Then u'd have to go about recording each audio source individually and that just becomes a hassle.  :-\
OMG I couldn't be happier about this collaboration! You are both two of my favourite YouTubers and it was so great to see you together!!! Great video guys 😊❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Molly, as someone who just hears sound, does it drive you nuts when people, girls mostly, turn every sentence into a question? I drives me batty and I would think a blind person would just want to slap the inflection right off of them. 😊
I only got Grace, immediately!! 😂😂
This is my first of these segments and I loved it! Stay beautiful ladies. You area appreciated and loved.
Ahh one of the best collabs ever.. You two are AWESOME!
I got None of these. LOL but it looks like you guys had so much fun. Awesome video.
This is proof of how the youtube algorithm is rigged.. You have gotten 11k views in 11 hours, which doesn't even come close to what is actually trending (views). All you have to do is put a big youtuber that is in kudos with the platform itself.....
Molly won, but very close! 9 to 7!
This was so cute aw haha Lilly scaring Molly's dog, not surprising
Wow she was on your channel!!! So cool!
Molly you are brilliant!! Your videos are inspiring, fun and insightful! You and Lilly are so cool together!! Loved this video!\nI also guessed Gigi when we first heard her
I couldn't guess ANY of these. I had nothing.
Molly you are stunning! 😀 great video
my two favourite people in one video!! this is unreal.
Omg this is amazing!!!!!! LILLY AND MOLLY WTF  SO AMAZING
I love your videos 💗
I've been dreaming of this!
can you make a collab with simplynailogical?
Perkins like the Braille company is exactly what I thought about and Perkins school for the Blind. It's what happens when you stare at Perkins Brailler for 3 hours.

You guys crack me up lol
Wasn’t this the exactly the same kind of challenge you had with Casey Neistat ? :) i like it. It’s a good challenge must try it myself with some friend !
I was sad they didn’t do Shane Dawson😢
Nope. First video of the entire channel that I cannot watch until the end. What a bad-mannered, loud-mouthed, fake person that acts like she's been brought up in the gutter. Unbearable.
Bb's😭😭😭loved the video!!
I've been subscribed to both of you for so long, this is perfect
But where are Dan and Phil
She looks likes she’s not blind
How is this trending with only 18k views.Youtube WTF?
Lily looks really pretty in this vid
Lilly got ryan before fousey lol
I wish I had known about all these memorial options that vets may offer when my kitty passed a few years ago. It would have been nice to have a lock of hair or a clay paw print. I was a mess at the time and not thinking clearly but I greatly regret not looking into it.
This was a roller coaster of emotions. Thank you for sharing!
We did home euthanasia with our cat Benjamin who had cancer. He was happy on our bed while we held him. So glad our vet did this for us. He cried with us, and didn't charge us!
I started the video unsure what to expect, then sad as your story of The Meow's condition reminded me of my own Siamese cat from childhood who unfortunately also had cancer, then laughing at the part about blow drying your dead cat at 2 in the morning, then crying at the end... this video was an emotional rollercoaster and it has helped put into perspective my options for when my own pets pass. Thank you, you are an amazing person.
I should not be sobbing because of this.
My Lil kitty Tia died in my arms and I cried like a little baby.
I'M CRYING SO HARD A KITTY DIED
did anyone else go and grab their cat
Death isn't an emergency- it's a permanent condition. You can't mess anything up. This gave me a lot of comfort, thank you <3 x
Crying in the club rn
R.I.P. Meow =(\nI don't know if you have seen the show American Pickers. It is a show about antique hunters. Frank Fritz in the show he loves cats. And when his cat (Arby) died . The funeral was at a real Human Funeral home. And it was so touching and happy at the same time. It was kinda like a New Orleans type Human funeral for a cat with people dancing load music playing. But my cat funerals are a lot more like in this video. (AND I CRIED HARD) But I wrap my cat in a cloth before burial. Not to preserve. But to help the cat body go into the earth and not be disturbed by other scrounging animals. I learned the hard way one time.
The bit talking about your emotions afterwards, unfortunately, made me laugh.\n\n'You are so warm, yet so limp and dead. Biology. Curious.'
Wow, I don't even know what I'm gonna do when my dogs die. This video made me think about it and it was very helpful
I put my Blu Blu down in my backyard, in the sun on a blanket with friends. I was devastated but it was the best choice, the vet let us have time with her after she was gone and then took her in a woven basket to be cremated. She brought her back in a sealed wooden box with her name on it. It was seriously the best thing I could have done and I never had to leave my house to take her to a vet or pick up her remains.
I was  watching this  with my cat laying on the bed a few feet away from me and when I started to cry he got up, laid against my back and cuddled my head (with his paws hugging my neck). Cats are amazing.
Aww..I  wasn't planing on crying today..God dammit..fucking cats making me feel
cats make me so emotional. I was completely calm and then I saw that picture of you holding Meow and I started crying.
My lil kimi cat had cancer and was put to sleep also purring wrapped in a warm fleece...we had her cremated at a pet crematorium,when they sent her ashes back they had enclosed some of her fur which was a lovely touch.i miss her.
I remember when we had to put our dog of a few years down. It was a sudden health problem that was stopped too late. The meds weren't working that he was prescribed. My mom said it was okay for me to stay in the waiting room. It was sad. Just to see him starting to lose strength. He was cremated and now in a nice little wooden box with his name on it. I'm glad he's doing better now❤
Totally beautiful. <3 We have two Ragdoll cats, and our oldest, blue bi-colour Magnus (nicknamed Noot-Noot), is actually a therapy cat for me as I have Crohn's disease (can imagine a coroner wouldn't be bored having to run what's left of my bowel :P ) and general anxiety disorder. I also hold a BSc in Human Anatomy (Hons), and I LOVE the way you present death, especially as demonstrated in this video with The Meow. Before we got the two Raggie boys, Magnus and Merlin, that we have now, I had another Ragdoll, inherited from a family friend, called Frankie. At age 15 she went into kidney failure after developing a dental infection, and during the remainder of her life (which included two trips to the after hours vet for pain relief and high fevers, and antibiotics) we had to refuse the options given to us by vets, such as removing her infected teeth, a portion of her gum tissue and possibly jaw, and even a form of chemotherapy (though I can't think of anything worse for kidney failure than pumping more junk into the body for the poor organs to try and deal with). My husband and I kept her with us for three months, with her sleeping on the bed with us, increasingly more so between us under the covers when she was sore and/or cold, before one Tuesday when she deteriorated suddenly, as happens with kidney failure in cats, and I immediately knew I couldn't put her through anymore, as this was the worse she'd been. Jumped in the car, phoning the vet down the road to get them to stay open for us as we brought her in and said goodbye. I held her as she drifted away, but I did feel very pressured by the vet to let go of her body, and let them take it away out of sight, so you can have the good memories now. Ideally I would have loved to have held her for longer than the half an hour we did (I was also doing what you did, alternating between sobbing, and also being stunned at how pliable and yet warm she was in death, surprised my husband didn't divorce me after that weirdness), and when the time comes for other two boys to pop their clogs - seriously, if anyone says Rainbow Bridge, I will punch, it's just a kind of unnatural, overly and unrealistic heaven-esque ideal - we'll be opting for home euthanasia, and probably having them at home with us for a day, a day or two, before cremation. Thank you so much for this video, and all the others you've made. <3
It feels strange to cry over a cat I have never met
I only cried a little bit until I starting think about my 4 cats. I can't imagine having to put them down... Also, was that Laganja?
This video has me sobbing hysterically :-( so sorry
i begged my parents to do everything at home but they refused and it still hurts me that i couldn't be with my dog
I don't know why I found your channel or why I started watching the content but I was listening to these in the background while I worked. Unfortunately, I am crying now thinking of my deceased dog. Unfortunately, I had her put down last year after 15 long year, enjoyable years of love and companionship. She was a fiery red Pomeranian and we went through a lot together. I knew she was getting old.. her hearing worsened.. she was pretty much blind, but she knew me and she stayed with me always. I found her on my floor one day with blood spots around her. I checked her over and still do not know where the blood came from, but I called my mom (who was away at the time) and was sobbing that I thought it was time and I felt bad trying to keep her alive any longer. I made the appointment with the vet for in a week's time. \n\nI tried so hard to get the days to go by slowly.. I even contemplated canceling the appointment out of sheer grief over the whole thing. I called my school at the time and told them I would not be coming in for a few days.. maybe a week. That Friday came.. the big day. I picked her up and swaddled her in a blanket.. got a taxi to the vet and went through the paperwork and process for a cremation. I actually started crying and shaking so much during the paperwork that most of it was unreadable.. they still accepted it.. I don't think they wanted to make me do it again. She was euthanized in the vet office, swaddled in a blanket I made for her when she was 5. \n\nI stayed with her the whole time. I watched the light disappear from her eyes and her body go lax. I kept telling her she was a good girl.. such a good girl and that I loved her. They asked me if I wanted to take the blanket with me.. it caused an anxiety attack. I told them I didn't want to disturb her.. i didn't want her to be cold... I wanted her to know she was safe and I was sorry for everything. For not taking her down sooner, for trying to believe she would get better. I walked home that day.. opting instead to be alone in my thoughts.. it rained on the way home. I sat there on the curb.. not bothering with an umbrella and I cried in the rain. I was so heartbroken from the experience.. I felt so alone despite having a younger dog. I felt like I had let her down and that the vet trip was preemptive. I didn't go back to school for a while and when I did I was nothing more than dead emotionally. \n\nIt has been a little over a year and I still miss her. Every year since.. I'm not sure when.. but every year we buy a tiny pumpkin for our pets. We bought 2.. one for our 3 cremated ones including my Pom and one for our current pet. It'll rot and petrify slowly, but part of me feels better knowing (now) that she didn't suffer. I'm not sure I would opt for a burial like you did or a home euthenization (ever) but I find comfort in knowing that the handlers of death understand that our pets are precious to us even in some do not agree. \n\nCrying on Oct 1st wasn't in my plans but thank you for everything. I know this video is old and you may never see this comment but thank you for this. Thank you for recognizing that death isn't always just a human event and that it can affect their animal companions.
why am i crying in the club rn?
I think I'll have to do this with my chihuahua. Luckily I have 10+ years with her yet I never wanna lose her 🖤🖤🖤
Anyone else going to grab their cat now?
Awww...I get it. I cried for months when I buried my min pin. Watching your baby suffer is painful.  When they die, a part of you dies as well. My baby passed in my hands after her shots.
I am so glad to see I was not the only one who burst into tears as I watched this video.
I had a beautiful siamese named Oscar who died of kidney failure. He passed while I was at work (12hrs factory)... He was sleeping stretched out when I left and was in the same position when I returned home and in rigamortise. I had no choice in positioning him curled up. It was nite time so I couldn't bury him right away. Luckily I had a deep freezer that I never used and put sweet Oscar in a box inside 2 ziploc bags and laid him inside. Side note: I was feeding him with a syringe for a few days before death and he had dried bits around his mouth. I cleaned him up before I but him in the freezer, also he had a crooked tail that laid literally in half and he could move the whole tail or just the tip. He never let me touch it while alive so I couldn't help myself and petted his tail while I was cleaning him up. Oscar laid in the freezer for two days until I could bury him. I'm glad you touched on the real things that may happen when your pet dies and I hope I served my kitty well in life and in death.
I was genuinely crying until you mentioned blow-drying your dead cat and then I lost it 😂
Luckily my dog, Charlie, has agreed to never die.
I will grieve my pets just as much as any person I love. \nI called over my kitties to hug them after watching this.\nMy oldest cat is showing signs of early aging and it eats at me when I let myself think about it.\n\nI know it's been a view years but I'm still sorry for your loss. But I'm also glad she got to die without stress. Any cat lover knows how upset cats get when they are stressed. You did the best thing you could do for her. <3
people thought i was twisted i took photos of my animals sat with them and saved a few feathers and my bunny fur i'm glad to see it's ok to deeply mouran a pet like you would a family member and yes rigger is very real 😳
About 3 weeks ago my cat Mae died and I'm still having a hard time getting over it she got sick and her liver started failing. I took her to the emergency room because I didn't know what was happening, and expensive bill and I didn't think she would die that morning and couldn't get to her in time but got to hold her dead body afterwards with one of my best friends there with me. I live in an apartment but my friends mom let me bury my baby in their backyard, they had to prepare the hole and so they told me to ask if they could keep the body till the next day, which they did. I wish however that I took her home and laid her out like you did, because they did not place her in a pretty position, I opened the box and was startled to see a zombie cat looking at me, it also made burying her a little awkward and I'm still really sad and watching this video did make me cry a little cause I miss her dearly, she was only a year and a half old and I had her since she was an itty bitty kitten. :/
So I feel weird bc when family or friends died I was eh . But when my pets have died I was a bawling nut job.
I cry whenever I hear/read stories about pets being euthanized. I am seventeen and have had my two older dogs since I was four. I have no idea how I'm going to get through their passing as I've never had to deal with something like that before. I'm scared :(
I began crying when you said she was purring when she died.
This made me cry
After losing his battle with kidney failure, my GusMonster was laid to rest under a very old walnut tree in a friend's yard. Though I didn't have a wake, I held him during the euthanasia, and after he was gone. He did get a natural burial.
Btw. I love your channel. It's very eye opening without being boring.
I wish I'd seen this video sooner! My cat died unexpectedly (he had a long-standing heart condition but he was doing pretty well around the time of his death) last month and we were so unprepared that we didn't really know what to do or how to process it. For any future (hopefully very distant future!) kitty deaths I shall be sure to take your lovely advice into account and spend more time really processing the situation instead of largely avoiding it which is what I ended up doing.
Animal death is the worst, I can handle a dead human with no emotion but when an animal dies, I'm ugly sobbing.
My cat was put down a couple years ago and my mom chose to have her cremated and to have the vet clinic keep them so they could scatter her ashes in a pet memorial but we have no clue were and it still angers me she did it ngl
I literally cried when you said she was purring when she died 😭😿
Living in a completely non accepting neibourhood we never had cats live in our beedroom or give them proper food but we had a lots of cats in our house who came for the leftovers and the trash so some of those cats became quiet close to us but we coulsnt really take care of them yet when they died it was so sad i could not even grieve in front of people it was so very hard
I had to put my beloved Genna to sleep last November, almost a year ago. She had been my faithful friend for 16 years, through all my depression and hardship. She had become my anchor. I depended on her to a rather unhealthy extent.\n\nThis is a long, rather confronting and upsetting story, be warned.\nEdit: Genna is my dog. I forgot to mention.\n\nFor several months prior her vet trips had been getting more and more frequent, suddenly she needed alzheimers meds where before she didn't, she was stiff and found it hard to move or eat from her bowl.\nThen she had a seizure in the middle of the night. I woke up to her convulsing on my bed, her heart so loud I could hear it thudding in the room. I stroked her gently until she regained consciousness.\nThe vet said it was likely she had a brain tumor, but she didn't seem to be in much pain.\nThen she stopped eating. I fed her puree'd rice and chicken with a syringe and took her to the vet, who gave her some appetite stimulators but I could tell she wasn't hopeful.\n\nAll through this our vet was very open, she told us that it was likely going to be time soon and once mum and I made it clear that we weren't interested in excessive intervention she became more honest with us. She said the choice would probably be mine, that Genna wouldn't die on her own. \nGenna slept on my bed every night. But the day after that final visit her eyes started drifting side to side repetitively. I covered her eyes with a blanket. No change. She couldn't control it.\n\nThat was enough. I had promised her when she was a puppy I wouldn't make her linger. Mum called the vet and made an appointment the next day, a Wednesday.\nWhen the morning came we took her to the dog park, it was lovely weather. We let her wander. I cried when I saw her walking away, knowing she was going to leave me forever. We had ice cream. I let her have some off my fingers. Mum drove my brother home while I lay on my back with her on my tummy, staring up at the trees and the sky. I told her to say hi to dad for me.\n\nWe drove to the vet. They took her into another room to put the catheter in, because apparently sometimes they struggled and it could be upsetting to the owner. But apparently she was as good as gold.\nShe sat on my lap, I stroked her, crying my eyes out. Genna looked up at me and licked my face, and then she was gone.\n\nThere was only one injection. The vet was crying. Mum was crying. I was crying. The vet told me that was so beautiful because most dogs look away and sigh when they die, but Genna gave me that little kiss.\n\nWe were left alone with her. She was so still. I wrapped her in my silk dressing gown and gave her her favourite toy. Her eyes wouldn't close. I didn't feel too terrible leaving her there, because her body wasn't her. She was gone.\n\nThe next day mum picked up her scatter tin, put it in the cupboard with my dads ashes and I didn't visit for at least a week or so. I had a long mourning period with rapid ups and downs, wore a locket with her picture, kept a lock of her fur which I think I threw away in a fit of self-loathing anti-sentimentality. Mum was worried, told me that maybe I should put her pictures and the locket away until I had recovered some, because all this was was a reminder.\n\nIt felt like I had lost part of my soul, like she was a familiar that had died. \n\nIt's been a year. I'm coping. Yesterday I went and bought a nice wooden box to put her ashes in so the scatter tin isn't just in a paper bag. This channel prompted me to do that actually. 30 dollars for an antique thing with a hexagonal shape and wire worked detail.\nI sort of wish I'd kept her fur, but I still have her collar and when I find it I'll put it in the box too. Losing pets is hard. Genna was a friend, a playmate, a piece of me.\nI can't have another dog, much as I want one, it's not possible with our current house. I'm left with Jerry, who is Genna's friend the cat, he's about 12 now. I'm sure soon I'll have to help my brother through the same process.\n\nThe whole hospice care thing can be rough. I think it's important to know yourself well enough that you're not going to be re-traumatised by whatever you do. I think if we had kept Genna at home I wouldn't have left, just cried over her hysterically. But then I had an unhealthy attachment to her I think.
Earlier this year, my dog died. Had her since I was 4. Never met an animal so human and just so, amazing.\nWatching this kinda, helped me in a way. Made me feel comfort.
Love it, Caitlin! I wish I could have spent that kind of time with my man Marvin at the end. But his death was unexpected. All natural burial tho on my friend's property where I always will know where he is. Here's my tribute if you get a chance. Love your work :) https://erinschultzuniverse.tumblr.com/post/165242563492/marvin-wheres-your-kitten-mew
Growing up, my parents put cats down with a bullet to the head.\n\nIts really traumatic when I look back on it. We as kids were obviously not allowed to see. But jesus b Jones. Farm life is brutal.
When my first cat died 4 years ago I sadly never got the chance to give him a proper burial or to say goodbye which still saddens me sometimes. He was killed by a car at night on a busy street so we could only assume that his body was taken by one of the hunters that often came along that road. He was my first real pet and ment a lot to me due to me being still very young and our family being very difficult to deal with. Thank you for this beautiful video, may all passed away pets be somewhere nice and safe. (RIP  Eduard 2010-2014)
I'm not going to be ready when my cat dies😢
I havent had a pet since my dog was run over when I was 18. I am 36 now. It was such a negative experience I couldnt go the hell again.
Long live the meow 💐💐💐💐💐as above so billow
Ill be honest i totally lost it when my bird passed away suddenly. I ended up keeping him in the freezer til i could cremate him and i gave him so many kisses. Losing pets are one of the hardest things ive ever been through. Rip Meow and Loki
After working in the veterinary field, I can honestly say you did a very understandable and compassionate thing for your Meow. Mammary tumors in a cat of her age are almost always malignant and they always come back with a vengeance.  Surgery at her age would have been hard on her and chemo even worse. Home euthanasias are always most comfortable for the pet.\n\nYou gave her a good death. A proper final gift for such a lovely companion.
I'm sorry for your loss, and I appreciate you telling the story.
I'm not crying you are
Would it be a good idea to plant a tree over the burial site of my pet? Not cremated, just a natural burial.
Home euthanasia is a good option. Another good option is to ask the vet for a high dose of Torbutrol (a pain killer and sedative) and give it to them at home, the right dose will have them nearly unconscious and in a blissed out state at which time one can drive to the vet and have the euthanol given in the car. No stress for the animal (or the person).
Caitlin, thank you SO much for this video and your other discussions of animal and human death and remains. I remember watching your Pet Death video when it first came out, but only had to use that knowledge now. Because of your lovely and open re-telling of the Meow's passing, I was able to plan for my cat's euthanasia yesterday and today's burial. I felt empowered to keep his body with me until I was ready, to chose among different cremation and burial methods, and so on. RIP to the Meow and her fellow old codger, Kelsey.
Oh man I just lost my own cat after having her for over 17 years. Know this video is several years old now but still sorry for your loss on your precious fur baby.
Once one of our cats passed away in her sleep but we didn't have the money to cremate her (at the time) and we were living in a condo in a city and didn't have a car to travel to a wooded area so we placed her in one of those styrofoam coolers and placed her in our freezer (which my dad turned down to the lowest setting, LoL) and we left her there for a good three months before we were able to cremate her and give her a little wake.
I started bawling at the home euthanasia and now have plans to save up and prepare for it if anything happens to my baby, Hex. However, it went awkward as you commented on blow-drying your dead cat at two in the morning.... And I broke out laughing enough to scare the kitty in my lap. XD
I'm not crying! 🙈
Ok, now I'm crying.
me three years after the meow passed away: NOOOOOOOO
I'm watching this thinking of my furry baby. My guinea pig has been with me for 5 years and counting. We both have been through so much together and she surprises me. There have been a few times now that I almost gave up but she proved me wrong and kept strong. But I know one day her time will come and I just hope I can be strong enough for her.
I really wish I'd had seen this about about two years ago when my cat, Hunter, was put down at 18 years old. I wasn't in the state when it happened but my mother took it so hard. It was very sudden. She was in good health despite her age, and just one day got ill and didn't survive the week. I have a year old puppy now and I'm going to try and keep all this in mind for the inevitable. Thank you for this, so so much.
Wow the end made me bawl.
I love how your cats name was the meow
I will die inside when my dog dies (sorry I’m a dog person)
this is a video i didn't want to watch, but needed to see
I had no idea that you could euthanize a pet at home! I'm so glad you told us that! My cat is 11 years old right now so I've been thinking more and more about what to do with her when it's her time. I can't imagine a better way for her to go than the way you described for your cat. Thank you so so much for making this video, you've made me feel a little less scared for the day when I need to let my baby go.
Oh heavens to Betsy; the last bit of you and The Meow, with her fangs out and the lavender.... ahhhh I can't stop laughing. I made the loudest noise. My neighbour must hate me...
cried like a baby is an understatement
It was a very lovely thing you did for your pet.  I just lost my precious kitty a few months ago. I had her for 19 years.  I thankfully didn't have to have her euthanized, she died naturally.  I think I found her rather quickly after death because she was still very limp when I picked her up.  She passed during the night and I found her before I left for work.  The worst thing I had to do was handle her body.  I understand death is natural and I was actually a bit relieved when she passed because I knew she wasn't suffering any more but I didn't want to handle her body.  After a few minutes of panic and tears.  I took a deep breath, grabbed and old towel and carefully wrapped her in it.  I'd been saving a shoe box for several months in preparation for this and I placed her in that. I later had her buried on my parents farm near the garden where we've buried other pets and a few last remaining farm animals.  I left the burial to my nephew.   I really have an aversion to wakes were bodies are laid out.  It's not even something I want for myself.  I'd rather a memorial service not have the body present.
Cried watching this. Lovely way to send off a pussy.  Buried my last one in the garden at my home.
I know this is very late, but I'm sorry for your loss. I have a young healthy kitty, but he's my first pet that I had by myself. This was beautiful to have the meow euthanized at home. This really gets me thinking, and I will definitely save up. I'll even check with my pet insurance plan go see if it's covered
I'm sorry about your kitty but the American Health Care System has nothing to do with Veterinary Medicine.  The vet was simply just giving you options.  Veterinarians and credentialed Veterinary Technicians are governed by the American Veterinary Medical Association and that is to insure proper standards are met.
How much is putting your pet to sleep at home? My cat is health but she's getting up there in age and I would love to be able to have last moments like you had with your cat.
Of all the videos I've watched of yours this was the one thaf bought tears to my eyes. And then laughter and at the vet said I'll show myself out and slowly backed out of the room.
I wish I had known about at home euthanasia when I lost my Percy last January. He had congestive heart failure and was vey skinny at the end. I was even afraid to ask to hold him. He has been cremated, and I miss hum every day. Farewell to your The Meow. You treated her so beautifully. When I figure out what kind of tree to plant, I will put him out with it. Thank you.
My cat Picatso was 15 years old and he passed a way 8/28. He was at my parents house be cause by the time I moved out of their house he was pretty old and i didn't want him to have to get used to a new place. He was my best  friend and my handsome man. Even when he was thinning and losing hair I told him how handsome he was. My heart still hurts from time to time but, i went to my parents house and told him goodbye and that I loved him  and that he was still my handsome man.
I wish I saw this before my Beaker passed  away a month ago. For the next kitty to pass away in my life, I'll take the time to do what feels right.
I lost my Shadow a couple of years ago after treatments didn't work. Is it horrible that I cried more over losing my cat than losing my dad? What a beautiful choice to be able to do this at home.
And my poor cat just dropped dead on the floor at the age of 4. He was a good cat.
My cat just turned 15 and I cherish every moment with her. She's healthy right now but life can happen quickly.
When my best friends cat Tiger died from kitty diabetes she was kept in a freezer for 3 months until we were all ready to take her and be cremated and it was a sad day to take her but we all got to say goodbye to her in our own time.
I was wondering why this made me cry...my family's 14-year-old lab is almost ready to go and it just hit me. Thank you for letting us know that it's okay to take our time and mourn.
Rip the meow
Meow had such beautiful eyes!
I'm actually crying
This was beautiful
...so sad,,,
I am sobbing
Annnnd im crying
And sobbing..  til you mention blow drying her.
The Meow had the cutest fangs.
What would you wish for? (No extra wishes! (or genies!))
Why is Aladdin the diamond in the rough?\n\n\n\nMaybe watch Once Upon A Time to find out. Youll get your answer then.
I wish to be a wizard #Hogwarts
He becomes a prince because the genie makes his father the king of thieves. Genies are supposed to be tricky. Aladdin's title of prince was surface level, only because far away his father was deemed the king of thieves.
Not having Jasmine make extra wishes is proof that Aladdin considered Genie a friend, and not just a tool to be used.
Who do youlike more J or Ben?
Ben would be great at Cinema Sins
I'd wish I was able to control and change matter on a molecular level with no unexpected/adverse affects to myself or others at the same effort as I am releasing while typing this message. With this power as powerful as I imagine I would be able to make myself any shape I would want, I could make a fortune remodeling homes or as a plastic surgeon. I could construct schools in low income areas with no assistance or funding. I could repurpose waste from landfills into forests and change the world for the better in a matter of days. I mean...if you're into that sort of thing.
The only thing I don't agree with is the notion that Aladdin could have gotten a job. While we're not entirely certain where this takes place (I mean come on, where is Agraba beyond being vaguely Middle Eastern/South Asian), it's almost certain that there is a caste system in place and that Aladdin is an Untouchable. As a known thief and an orphan, he wouldn't have been allowed to interact with anyone of a higher caste, aka any of the vendors or their patrons.
Will say 1 trillion dollars and to meet you and dantdm and too wish him free
You know, you guys should do Star vs the Forces of Evil. It's a cartoon, but its on Disney Channle.
He didn't mean I don't buy that. literally. He ment I refuse to take that insult.
My three wishes(they're cliché, I know):1. World Peace2. Eternal Happiness for everyone3. Immortality for everyone :')
I have an explaination for the animals entering the cave.\nAnimal companions can't as an extension of the human they accompany, therefore Abu is an extension of Aladin but Iago is an extension of Jafaar which is why he can enter. This would also explain why the tries look like they surely apply to Abu, Abu taking the ruby was the same as Aladin taking it.
I would wish to change the rules and then wish for infinite wishes.
I would wish to see One Direction live
I really like you man but this was... Really.... Far fetched....... Like... There are plot holes but still...(also Jasmine wasn't sleeping on getting married she's like 15 AFTER her birthday) and you can't blame him for stealing... How do you want the guy to live because obviously no one is nice enough to offer them food.. Yes I know he's a thief but you can't be mad at him for it he's surviving.
Hasn't Aladdin been a prince (of thiefs) the whole time...
I'd wish for more genies because I cannot wish for more wishes, I would wish for my loved ones to be immortal so they would have never died in the first place, and I wish that there was nothing wrong with the world no wars no dieases
I would wish:\n*1.* To meet all of my idols.\n*2.* For parents that actually cared about me.\n*3.* The ability to read, write, and play music.
In America (obviously where Disney is) I don't buy that is basically I don't believe that\nAladdin is saying he doesn't believe he's Riffraff or a street rat
Can we just take a moment to appreciate the sloth pillow in the background?
I would wish for end of world hunger, world peace, and Hamilton tickets
Maybe the touch nothing rule is only when it's on purpose with intent to take it?
5:43 Do that more often
Still my favorite Disney movie tho. The songs are the best!
Fine then I wish for more lamps!!
When I think of it when Aladdin wished to be a prince it sounds like he wants to be a prince by marrying Jasmine
Buy that means he doesn't agree with that
The book makes more sense.
It's... A KIDS MOVIE
When you talked abt the cave having an ear piercing, I immediately answered your question with claire's
carpets are expensive, and most of those don't even fly! most? What carpets are you buying and where can I get some??!!!
...does he not understand the less literal meaning of the word ‘buy’. aladdin isnt actually buying anything, he is saying he doesn’t believe or understand that.
Ben when you said that every time Aladdin lies to jasmine, instead of saying the big blue feather you said the big purple feather when it is blue
This is gonna sound cheesy but 3 wishes: \nFor my friends' lives to be relatively stress free \nFor my best friend's health issues to fuck off\nFor my mom to lose custody of my sister \n(Let's pretend the genies wouldn't fuck it up lmao)
Just saw the musical. It fixes like all those problems.
Oh my gosh. I could not stop laughing. Aladdin has completely fallen.
i would wish for world peace
No wish limitations, then more wishes
YOU DONT BUY ANYTHING i LAUGHING SO HARD THAT IM CRYING
I wish I could wish for more wishes
4:18 - Maybe the diamond thing is like D&D: you need a diamond worth more than 1500G.
Yes the cave has an earring...as does the Genie. It symbolizes being a slave for life.
Disney has never made any sense.
The whole point of the movie was that it doesn't matter where you come from, how rich you are, what you wear, etc., but that your actions are what define you. Princes are humans just like alladin or jafar, so a prince's clothes are really what make him a prince. That doesn't really matter though because alladin turns out to be somewhat more than a prince by deciding he doesn't want to be one again.
I would wish that the X-men were real, and then wish to be one of them...
I'd wish for my girls pussy to taste like yakult
i'll wish for the powers of a genie
i would wish for: 1- Cancer to disappear entirely, not just for a cure. 2- *does best trump impression*: billions and billions of dollars. 3- idk
The carpet is the first victim of the cave in the original tale. He cave didn't kill him, it turned him into a magic carpet. That's why the carpet wants to help him in the first place, he wants to escape his prison.
I would wish for genie’s powers...no not to be a genie just to have all of his wish granting powers. Since I wouldn’t be a genie, all of the limitations that go along with it like the number limitation, the not killing, not resurrecting, not forcing people to fall in love would be nonexistent. I wouldn’t have to serve any kind of master, nor would I have to stay for all eternity in a lamp waiting for someone to release me. I could release the genie that gave me my powers without using any more wishes because the power would be mine. Basically, I would have all the strengths of a genie and none of the weaknesses. It would be sweet ass.
When this analogy is applied to a person it means that the person has great potential but is roughand unpolished, but with hard work the true potential of the individual can be discovered. The phrase “diamond in the rough” may also refer to someone who is genuine and valuable inside but has a rough exterior.
didn't he use the last wish to set genie free?
Read the original story, it answers all these questions (jk, no it doesn't at all, except some of them, but it is amazingly weird).
When it comes to the cave, I think part of it has to do with intention. Like, the guy who had to slit the throats to get the scarabs obviously would have tried to steal something for his own evil purposes. Aladin and Abu were not. When Aladin was touching the carpet, he wasn't trying to steal it, he just stepped on it. But then when Abu tried to steal the gem, that's when the lava defense system was activated. \n\nAlso, I watched a video explaining how when Jafar started making it wishes, it some how undid Aladin being a prince and that when Genie was going on about 'tell her the truth' it wasn't that he should tell her that he wasn't a prince but that he was indeed poor 'street rat' when they first met ( because even after Jazmine finds out who he was, he still pretends that he was always rich ). I don't remember exactly what was said, but I swear it made sense.\n\nAnd if would be really mean if Jazmine took the lamp to start making wishes. That would really be taking advantage of the genie. Even if she was wishing things like make sure Jafar never comes back, it would still be kind of selfish and takinng advantage of genie's sacrifice. What I never understood is why couldn't genie make aldin a prince AFTER he was set free? Like, he still has genie powers, so why can't he, out of his own free will, make Aladin a prince again?\n\nI realize there are still some plot holes, but I feel this fills in a few of them.
Since when did Disney make send
Supercarlinbrothers would be good at cinema sins *ting*
What if alladin was never the chosen one at all. What if the chosen one was abu
1. All my wish work perfectly the way I want. \n2. to always have enough money for what I want to buy.\n3. to have the ability to communicate with all lifeforms
I would wish that Trump grew up with a mother like the mother from the TV show Empire, Cookie and she would beat his ass and teach him how to act right... That is all 😁
I actually really like this movie. Aladdin is one of my favorite Disney movie.
For overpopulation to not be a problem we have to worry about\nFor everyone in the world to stop discriminating each other (world peace would just be weird, seriously, think about it)\nand then one selfish thing here: For me and my friends who are going to Anime Detour to get all of our cosplay stuff free, and the tickets free
Essentially Jafar canceled out Aladdin's wish of being a prince. It wasn't just revealing oh hey he is just some street rat. Jafar took it all away from him too. How this was not a wish I don't know, I think he used his own powers to do it. That's why the Genie is like wish again and I will make it happen, it would have to be a new wish.
I always thought if I ever got a magic lamp I would use my wishes give it my friend she will user hers then she can give it back to me  like I know I am being selfish but I don't care free wishes for daysss
Why didnt fix it felix use his magic like fixing on vanellopes glitches
I've been saying that about Jasmine wishing for years! (Well, since 1992...)\n\nThree Wishes:\n1) Simultaneous instantaneous Omniscience with eidetic memory.\n2) Simultaneous Omnisophence without my Will ever becoming slave to my abilities.\n3) Simultaneous eternal Omnipotence.
I want to know what happens to Jasmine if she doesn't get married.
As a kid I noticed some of these inconsistencies already, but damn when you put them all together it becomes clear that the entire movie really doesn't make any sense at all!
rugs are extremely expensive, and most of those don't even fly.. So... You have... You have a flying carpet?
My three wishes!\n\nFor my first wish: I wish for my second wish to definitely come true.\n\nFor my second wish: I wish for my third wish to definitely come true.\n\nFor my third wish: I wish for my first wish to not come true.\n\nI will want to know what happens next.
Pants with pockets\nBen understands girl's problems.
I LOVE Aladdin- don’t get me wrong. But I’ve always thought the carpet thing!
BOO-YA!!!!!

Notice how genie only has one earring as well
Infinite wifi anywhere, a tardis and the new season of Yuri on ice
Those who claim that the pivot point of this video is that one joke in the beginning about buying obviously had it fly over their head. :^)\nAlso, I think this is a pretty good analysis but there are some answers to a lot of your points that I can already think of, however you do bring up some interesting and solid points too.
the genie can bring the dead back to life, in the next line he says, I don't like doing it, it's not a pretty picture.
the broadway version fixes the wish to be a prince again plot hole. Instead, the genie offers aladdin to make a wish that everyone would forget that he really is Aladdin 😊
Wishing for peace n joy
1. Immortality 2. Ability to travel back and forth threw time without any repercussion that effect history 3. Save the third wish and have a genie go with you back and forth threw time.
Look close enough at every Disney movie and you notice some seriously weird things. Take Tangled for example:\n- Drop of the sun does somehow not incinerate the entire atmosphere, but creates a flower. And it doesn't even look like a sunflower. Why not go the extra mile, Disney?\n- Sunflower magic = blond hair that heals wounds when hair hears a song. Explain that one.\n- King and queen: Super entitled! Take all the life saving magical medicine for their own kid. They don't even think about maybe using that all-curing plant to grow more of them. To give some to the common folk. Nope! They are just peasents!\n-  It was way to easy for that old women to get into the palace. \n- They never found that girl for 18 years, yet she was in a tower just two days away. ...Seriously?\n- Highest ranking military official: A horse! \n- And also... where the heck did she get that chameleon from? Chameleons live in tropical jungles, not german forests! What's with that?
for ulimited wishes

Dude. Caste System.

You guys should soundproof your set
SuperCarlinBorthers, I just recently watched Inside Out and Big Hero 6. I just got a crazy idea, what if Honey Lemon is related to Riley in some way??? Riley lives in San Fransisco, but In Big Hero 6 they live is Sanfransokyo(or something like that). So what if Honey Lemon is theme grandchild of Riley? Just skmehing I thought of...
1.) That Pokemon was real. 2.) 1 billion dollars. 3.) world peace
A baboon chatters with more sense than you do... you're like this... person.. they gave too much sugar too and rambling so fast and in so many directions... dude.. Aladdin wasn't talking about BUYING Something he was talking about not agreeing... if you actually had a brain you'd know that. Maybe you are too sugar buzzed. I'm not saying Aladdin (the movie) is perfect. But your rants make no sense.

Выглядит очень хорошо, для 97 года игра мне кажется была бы прорывом, портировать ее на PS1 думаю вышло б. Даже если игра в основном брала б текстом... эт такую игру потеряли(

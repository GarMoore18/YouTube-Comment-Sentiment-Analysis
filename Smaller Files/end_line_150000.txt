I'm mildly scared of Jenkins. You know what? Tell him I'm sorry for saying that, he's very nervous and  i shouldnt have said that but I wasn't ready to see him when I opened this video. Cool vid tho lol.
Your stuff is so cool approximately how long dose it take to film one vid
Stopped everything I was doing to watch this 🖤🤘🏻

Notification squad!!!
Hi
OH ME GERSH!!!!!
*JENKINS*
I was watching a different Madeyewlook video when I got this notification lol.
You are so amazing. Its so satisfing watching you do your art. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!
All to well is the best ts song
I love how Andy keeps trying to stir the pot regarding T Swift and not one of these older celebrities gives a shit
Olivia B is a legend for asking that question haha! Especially if that's a false name to honour Taylor's cat!
Maggie looks like she's an aristocrat from the 1930's.
THE SCARF IS CLEARLY IN HIS DRAWR, EVEN NOW
its i left my scarf there at your sister house and you still got it in your drawer even now
all too well is not just A song is THE song
left my scarf there, at your sister's house, and YOU still got it IN YOUR DRAWER even now.
All too well is such a masterpiece
In a song?? All Too Well is #That song
it might not have been about jake?
Wait a minute... what happened to but you keep my old scarf from that very first week, cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me?  \nI thought she was talking about him not his sister.. i mean yes, she left it at his sister's house at one point but then he got it and kept it to himself
Jake has the scarf. He keeps it in his drawer, even now.
NO he still has it! in his drawer, even now
im sure Taylor has many more missing scarves
Lol Maggie doesn't care
wow people actually ask Maggie about the scarf? lol, it's jake you need to ask!
*ALL TOO WELL IS THE SONG*
i cannot believe it's even trending. FIND THE SCARF ALREADY!!! Taylor needs peace. . . Well, more the Swifties. Lmao.
All Too Well is the best song to ever exist *period*
The amounts of fucks she gives is perfection.
Maggie doesn’t have Taylor’s scarf. Taylor specifically says in the song that Jake kept her scarf because it reminds him of innocence and smells like her.
Maybe the song isn't even about Jake after all lol maybe it was another dream of hers that inspired it
Maybe someone can use that scarf and silence Taylor swift.
00:40 is that guy 50 cent???
I feel like she should have Kristen scalls voice
Obviously the scarf is Taylor Swift's innocence (virginity). She left it at his sister's house. Swift's Red is actually her best lyrically with metaphors. Her songwriting skills during Red was even compared to that of Leonard Cohen.\n\n\n\nOh, and the album's title is Red. RED!!!!
All to well is the best ts song...https://goo.gl/czCVJA
Rachel Dawes is Jakes brother?! Small world
If she does have the scarf, please God make her cover up that butter face.
All Too Well is her best song
Imagine what'll happen if Taylor releases that 8 minutes version...
All too well is the best song that Taylor has ever written. Yes, the equivalent to ATW in her other albums are 'back to December', 'clean' etc... but it's by far the most beautiful she has ever composed. It's her 'case of you' know whattamean.
Texas underground artist, trying to better myself and get my family out of the streets, help me get heard, share, follow, repost, thanks 🙏 https://soundcloud.com/legit-tim \nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/open_graph/artist/2950553
Taylors saying I fucked jake at your sisters house
She been looking grandmothery for the last ten years...she just has one of those grandmother faces
inquiring minds want to know. god I'm going to retch.
Maggie G. looks like Sloth from The Goonies.
DAFUQ she has on, an aluminum foil dress?
I love Maggie's ring!
រឿងសិច
Shes aging quickly
Give it back!
*Give it back!*
Find in Maggie
Why does she look 90?
Secret: Andy Cohen is really......Alex Trebec....
Its my grandma!
50 s laugh...contagious 😂😂😂😂
'All Too Well' is Taylor's Top 5 best songs. PERIOD. That is a fantastic song, I want her and Jake to get back together and break up so she can write a sequel.
Taylor is a walking STD. More men than Elizabeth Taylor.
Taylor's too ugly for jake anyways... Cringy piece of shit.
well said Maggie who cares, swiftards should get over it, Taylor's  BS is exhausting
Her face reminds me of that old episode of the Twilight Zone, when the old man that was dying made his relatives wear masks to recieve their inheritance. js
Can't believe my video 10 Kittens 1st Day Outside has over 2 million views now! \nGo check it out and hit that subscribe button!  xoxo Sarina 😊 \n\nhttps://youtu.be/DcJk32AJckg
She's ugly.
I think everyone agrees she's one of the ugliest actresses ever 💯😎
Damn how desperate for 'drama' is he to ask a irrelevent stupid question!!Never mind the person making a career out of bashing old partners/friends..
Maggie Gyllenhaal is one of Hollywoods ugliest celebrities.  Proof that you don't need talent or good looks to become famous, just Jewish connections.
She might not have that scarf but she sure has the face of a hound dog ...😕😕😕😕
WHY DON'T YOU AFRICAN FOLKS GET BACK TO AFRICA AND SPEAK YOUR OWN AFRICAN LANGUAGES AND LIVE WHERE YOU BELONG AND LEAVE US CAUCASIAN PEOPLE AND OUR ENGLISH LANGUAGE ALONE AND GO FUCK YOURSELVES! GO MIND YOUR OWN AFRICAN BUSINESS IN AFRICA LIKE THE ASIANS MIND THEIR OWN BUSINESS IN ASIA LEAVE CAUCASIAN WHITE PEOPLES ALONE. GO HOME. GO MAKE SOME POP AND RAP MUSIC IN YOUR OWN AFRICAN LANGUAGES IN AFRICA YOU MUDDAFUCKAS!
Whenever I make something with potato, before i put it in the curry or soup etc , i put the potato in the microwave for about two mins, just so speed up the cooking process because potatoes always take so much longer than everything else ! Great video, and love the coat xx
Glad I'm not the only one who basically doubles the amount of garlic in any recipe. Extra garlic is always a must
If your away again with Lilly and you don't want the same videos as her.  Why don't you do a room tour video and view and what you ate in a day.  That would make up another video.   Or a come shopping with me in whatever place your at.
150% obsessed with that coat!! xoxo, caylie
Just went to the gym for the first time in weeks and now this video pops up, guess this is a sign to live healthy again hahah - EVERYTHING LOOKS SO GOOOOOOOD 👅👅💗💗
So healthy and INSPIRATIONAL!🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
no joke eating a Block of Cadbury milk chocolate while watching this
Waiting for your house tour video ...
Thx for being honest!! I feel like a lot of youtubers upload a what i eat in a day and only show the good stuff or pretend to be super healthy and eat super fancy things and small portions only. 😒\nOn another note: the coat is super pretty 😊
Anna I love how honest and normal you are. Brilliant video :)
Anna can i move in with you?? I'm always wearing my dressing gown at home and everyone tells me off! They're so cozzzzzyyyyy!!
A curry and GBBO 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Cute nails!!

Pickled onion monster munch - throw back!!!
Byyyyyeee, love you--cutest cutest cutest bean\n\nI love theeeeese eeeeeee
more WIEIAD videos pls!!!!!!
Great vid subscribed 👌
Hi Anna - OMG I just watched one of may fave celebrities in the Philippines and she mentioned you in her last video - she is a fan of yours!!!! Kris Aquino is the Queen of all Media in the Philippines - she subs to your channel. Be great if you can do a colab with her - that would be awesome. Her channel is https://www.youtube.com/TheAquinos
Hi Anna..Ms. Kris Aquino is a fan of you and wants to meets you. \nhttps://youtu.be/HceqReOKTQc
I always cook more soup to freeze. Usually in autumn my freezer is full of variations of soup 🍵
I am SO happy I've found another Flamin' Hot Monster Munch obsessive. Everyone I know is all about the Pickled Onion (Vom!) 🙌
They have Great British Bake Off on Netflix here in the States and I couldn't stop watching - absolutely love it! 🤗
I'm eating McDonald's and watching this 😳
OMG i've been using estee's soup recipe for years too! love it! hahah
Love your fashion sense so much :D especially the dressing gown :D
Would love to see more of these videos 😍
I love your What I Eat in a Day videos. So many great recipes and meal inspo.
The link to the soup recipe doesn't work, but I'm guessing it's the Power Protein Soup 😏 \nThanks for the inspiration Anna, you just gave me a good idea for lunch and dinner !
That soup look delicious, I'm gonna try it myself!
What size coat did you go for ? Is it true to size ? X
I love this kind of videos!!
Anna, really miss your evening get ready videos like the one you did in Paris. You did such a great job and the editing was amazing. Would love to see more!
You need to clean your shower head. Put some white vinegar in a ziplock bag, stick the head in the bag, use a hair tie or rubber band to secure the bag , keep it overnight and it will clean itself, next morning just scrub it a little and it will all clean
i could watch you for hours and hours!! Love videos like this, more please :-) and by the way: the coat is GOALS, i will order as well. Just for reference: which size did you order? :)
You're my favourite youtuber and absolutely love these chilled types of vlogs! Especially what I eat in a day! ❤️ much love x
This was motivation for me, thanks 😎😇
Your hair is looking soooo glossy and lovely! Updated hair care routine?! x
I love your nails in this video! What is it?!
You are truly a role model. Your vlogs are my favorite !
For a girl who has eaten loads of junk food you look fab!! Love that coat x
Thanks for the healthy motivation.  I've been on the junk food train myself.  Vegetable soup looks so yummy.  I love your new coat too!
You should get an immersion blender. Saves so much time for soups like that. You can throw in the veggies straight away and then blend it in the pan.
Loved your throw back to Barney the Dinosaur haha! Great video, super hungry after watching this now :)
Yet another cracking vlog! Thanks for being incredible with the content... and just in general! www.byharrison.com
Anyone know where you can find a coat like this but way cheaper??
If you love cinnamon grahams, you might like this recipe for grain-free Almond Cinnamon Crunch cereal. It's seriously SO GOOD. Plus the little squares are cute and you feel so accomplished having made your own cereal that's not muesli or granola! https://www.mynewroots.org/site/2017/08/cinnamon-crunch-cereal-hemp-milk/
Just to let you know worcestershire sauce isn't vegan as it has anchovies in it x
Your life is so soothing to watch. I love the coat! I'm looking for a coat just like that except with buttons.
You have a good attitude about food 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻\nBalance is key 🏆
We love your What I Eat In A Day videos! You always have the best recipes that we like to try out. Also, that cost looks incredible on you!\n-Ash & Shelbs xx
I just found your channel a couple weeks ago and I've been catching up and absolutely love all of your videos!
Hey Anna, have your ever tired mixing your Greek yoghurt with protein powder? I have it all the time and it is amazing for the sweet tooth 👌🏼 especially if you the 0% fat rage Greek yoghurt. Definitely give it a try, especially vanilla protein 😍 xxx
Love that coat!!! What size did you get (for reference, not nosy 😬)?
Could you do a video on your favourite cookbooks or recipes?! I'm stuck in a rut with food and needing inspiration 😊
Im eating pizza off of the oven tray while watching this x
Saw the apricot,thought I'd let you know you have a subscriber from Armenia,the homeland of apricot 😊❤️🇦🇲Apricots are amazingly healthy!
All I would love right now is a Dairy Milk Chocolate Bar ngl!! 😂😂
Hi Anna! I microwave my potatoes first to make sure they are soft. Just be sure to stab them first. I can so relate to not everything cooking and coming together at the right time. Most recently for me it was some lentils in a veg chili.
Drinking wine and laying on the couch while watching this.... I noticed you sure know how to cook Anna! You cut things properly and not just pretend (you won't imagine how many of my friends still can't cook!)
Boil your potatoes before putting them in a curry!
If you want potatoes to cook on the stove you have to add liquid otherwise it'd burn before they cook. Also dice them a lot smaller. But man That soup looked so good! I add Worcestershire sauce to everything too lol its so savory and delicious
you always look so chic, loveee the coat 😭😍
Is there a glossier haul coming then?
Gotta have that balance! I bought some chocolate on vacation so I've been treating myself to a piece (or two haha) after meals..but the meals are healthy at least!! :) The vegetable curry looks so good too..and I'm loving that coat.
Anna I keep trying to subscribe to your newsletter and I never receive the confirmation email. I've tried on different days and it just won't work. Just thought you should know in case it's an issue on your end. Love your videos xo
Hey Anna  I <3 your videos. \nAre you planning to do a haul for capsule wardrobe? That would be helpfull. And also some tips to buy clothes that are current but not too trendy because next year they go out of style!!!
I could not relate to this anymore right now! :)
That coat is everything I have ever dreamed a coat to be ✨ NEED IT
Girl you bring joy to my heart ❤️.. and that cookies looks amazing 🍪 🤤
I love these kind of videos!  And I love it on Wednesday's when I wake up there's always an Anna video waiting on me!! 💕💕
Not Lazy! Judicious use of time. :)    Life's too short to waste time making rice
the food looks great!
Potatoes cook faster in water than in sauce. Done the same thing. I think its better to pre-cook them first and throw them in last :)
The picture of that cookie toward the end look ...so GOOD !!!!!!!! Lovely vlog as usual. xx
I just went out to the kitchen, picked at a packet of cooking choc chips without any control/ awareness. I have no idea how much I had....What is wrong with me? :P
I LOVE THESE VIDEOS
And now I'm hungry....;-)
Aaahh that music you use, so relaxing. Makes me think of being at the beach, when I really should be working right now haha
I love your What I Eat In a Day videos! ♥
Nice Vans Anna! Love your foodie vids.
Anna! You didn't show all the chocolate buttons you consumed while watching Bake Off!
Loved this 💕
What's your take on the new GBBO hosts? We're so stressed out about it here in the States!
Liked it before watching it cause I love what I eat in a day vids/vlogs 👌🏼
Love your food vids as usual! But the vocal fry was very difficult to listen to .
Please stop being so self indulgent and talking about yourself.
Wow, you're so lucky to have the cherry bombe cookbook already! So excited for it in October! I totally recommend their podcast, it's awesome!
Your voice is annoying
Stock cubes aren't exactly healthy. Just make vegetable stock from fresh vegetables and freeze it.
Have you tried Lanolips lip balm for your lip issue? I used to have super dry lips but this product has totally changed them, it's nice and thick and I apply it just before bed
Hee Lily! I always love your videos! :) I have had the same problems with my lips for a few years. I went do the dermatologist a few times. But what really helped me was that I put on sudocrem (https://www.sudocrem.co.uk/sudocrem) (I live in the Netherlands not sure if it is called the same there, but it is the white thick cream for baby bums) every night before going to sleep, on my lips and a little bit over. You look ridiculous and it is not very kissable/sexy. But it does really help.
Tip on how to get rid of fruit flies! (this is totally weird, but it works for me!) \nPut out a little bowl of apple cider vinegar, with a squirt of liquid kitchen soap, and then put cling film over it. Pierce a few little holes in the cling film, and let that sit on your counter!!! \nHope that helps! :) \nP.S. I love your daily chill vlogs! <3
Heya..  just a question about your hair... how long did that Brazilian treatment last for????
What shade do you use the laura mercier concealer in?
Hi LiLy can you recommend a good Japanese restaurant in London!!! I always love your vlogs!!!
I've been asked if I was pregnant in 6 different countries.  I feel your pain
Loved the makeup you did in this vid - very beautiful. Your skin looks amazing and I'm way jealous. \n\nAnd hey, the negative thing is a shit at times eh. It'll come good again :)\n\nNo blogging, vlogging or anything for us lot while in Italy please. It's you and Rich time only. Take care of you!
Love your vlogs!!!
Hello, Lily! Maybe I can help, have you tried using an actual corticosteroid on you lips instead of only lip balms? I am allergic to most matte lipsticks, and I used Triamcinolone acetonide (I'm not 100% sure that's how you say it in english), after a few days my lips were not sore anymore, and a while later they were completely back to normal. I applied it on my lips before I went to bed and slept with it, it is not the most comfortable thing in the world, but it really helped, also, I didn't use anything on my lips until it was cured, only the La Roche-Posay Ciclaplast baume B5. I hope you will feel better soon (regarding your lips and all the other things bothering you right now).
I hope you cheer up soon. Life is life..not always Ross. I do think however your remarks about Fenton Beauty was a bit narrow minded. Most of the reviews talk about it being very natural, except for perhaps that megawatt highlighter which you have to buy. If Patrick star can find a shade I am sure something might suite you.
omg time has flown by so quickly, I can't believe your one year anniversary is already coming up! I was also surprised to hear that Jemma has a baby, I feel like you were just talking about her wedding related activities!\n\nI personally enjoy watching your different days. You are human, I don't expect you to be happy and jumpy all the time. In fact, the youtubers that only record those days seem so...fake to me. Just keep vlogging and I'll keep watching :)
Please don't feel any pressure to be positive constantly in your videos. I think most of us are quite tired of all those perpetually perky youtubers. It just seems so fake, nobody can be that happy and excited about everything all the time. A bit of moodiness is in fact refreshing.
Love your nails!!
Too bad nobody told you about this amazing lip balm that we have in Swedish pharmacies, you could have picked it up in Stockholm! It was originally made for the Swedish military to use for your lips, hand and sore feet. And you can even cook with it, too. It's called Försvarets hudsalva (the Military skin salve, pretty much) and you need to try this if / or the next time you come to Sweden :)
Thank you for being real and owning the grumps!  I'm there too.
To get rid of fruit flies you should mix apple cider vinegar with any sugary syrup, a drop of soap and some water. The soap is important to break the surface of the liquid which the flies would otherwise be able to walk on. You will notice that the bottom of your glass will be covered with flies within a couple of hours. I promise.
Lily, your honesty is so refreshing. Don't ever feel the need to apologize or try & justify to viewers why you are feeling a certain way. Lots of us have times when we feel exactly like you, but fortunately we don't have to go through it so publically. That said, a public platform to air how you're feeling is at times a really positive thing for those watching, to know they're not alone. Double edged sword really. I thoroughly enjoyed this vlog. Your curry has got my hungover self today  wishing I could've had Richard's bowl! 😂 Big hugs. X
Lilly I got married 18 months ago and since the day we got married the baby question has been asked continually. 😱\nI also have my own business and I went through the same thing as you. It got to me too, and I had a rant too! \nI learnt to just try and let it go over your head and let the people that think because your married and a certain age you should have a baby think what they want! Xxx
i like it when you are just being yourself...
Aww lily\n I'm sure the only reason most of us wouldn't want to hear you being sad and negative is because we wish you all the best and that you can get back to being happy and positive rather than feeling that way. Not just that we don't want to hear you being sad. But, failing that, it's always better to hear how you are truely feeling so that you can get the support you need and deserve to help you get back to the good place in life! Sometimes life gets us down without any particular reason that we can fix, but it's always a good idea to at least identify that the feeling is a little off because sometimes just saying it out loud can be the first step to feeling better. Anyway, hope you feel better soon. I can't imagine having to work in an industry where your personality is your brand! Feeling out of sorts truely must make that very difficult. But know that I enjoy hearing how you are and what you think of things and always appreciate your honesty. X
I feel the same way with me and my friends, we don't take pictures anymore! Haha we just hang out and chat 😊
Cheer up Buttercup :o)  Sorry you're feeling down, but thank you for sharing and I hope things turn around soon!
Can relate to so much in this vlog. Feeling moany today too. Also feel like I have to buy a pink fluffy cushion (and not sure I really even like them!) I even had a lipstick allergy about the same time you did! I've found the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask pretty good. As well as the original allergy I seem to react to lanolin, which of course is in lots of lip treatments!  And I have puffy hair! lol Keep keeping it real Lily!
I'm so glad you don't hide when you're feeling down (not glad you're down though obvs!) ☺ I think you're really helping your followers by making it a very normal thing and accepting it. Life isn't always rosy but it can sometimes seem like it online! I love your vlogs, they inspire me to be better and to keep pushing through even if I'm feeling down xx
Sorry to hear you've been bummed out lately - I go through periods of that, too. I've also got a fairly public persona (not on YouTube but in real life) and I have to say: don't read the comments. I've been married now for 9 years - I'm 34 - and I get the same senseless and shitty comments from people who think they know how to run your life. I'd say, more often than not, they're probably jealous of you -- they're generally upset that you're failing to follow a prescribed pattern. Those who are most successful in life do not follow a prescribed pattern - do what you do well and put on the blinders!!! XO!!
what nail color do you have on?
I am really sorry you don't feel great Lily. I wish you could be ok soon...not because I don't want to see a moany  video ( I am just using your own words, I don't think you're moany at all, you're just a human being having shitty days) but just because I care about you as I just care about a friend. I know it's a stupid thing because we're obviously not friends but it's the way I feel. So, we're all here to support ❤️ xoxo
Lily , everybody cries\nAnd everybody hurts sometimes xx \nI hope you are feeling inspired and motivated . If not , give yourself a break . Lots of love ❤️🙏
I hate fruit flies and I found that there are reusable fruit flies traps on amazon that you just put apple cider vinegar in it and that is it...
I'm sorry you're feeling so down, Lily. I know things will get better for you, hang in there. I actually enjoyed this video, not because I like that you feel sad, but because it felt like hanging out with a friend, which was kind of comforting after a long day at work. Good for you at calling out the pregnant comments; hope people have the decency to stop.
Actually loved this video Lily. Feeling the same myself today 💕
is that a love island water bottle at 12:34? i'm still in mourning about love island
I think when the social media activity became someones full time job the aspect of pressure, popularity race, obsession of new content might be an issue. But it happend with all of us whatever our job is. It is natural to feel sometimes not in the mood or like being at the crossroads. So don't feel sorry to be at this place at the moment....
I adore you JUST The way you are! JUST be you !!!
*hugs* from an internet friend who also sometimes experiences the sads.
Hi Lily , I rarely comment but wanted to say I love that you are genuinely honest . Love everything you do . Sending you big hugs from Ireland  xx
Lily, maybe you should try lanoli for your dry lips. For example dr. Lipp have lip balm with 100% of lanolin :)
I never comment on videos but I I feel so down and very negative some days and I wonder if I'm depressed but then it goes away the next day! I also told friends at work recently that I'd got some good news (a promotion) and they all said they thought I was going to say I was pregnant!! 🙄🙄 Just age and being with a partner for a long time people always think that's the next step!
Have you considered a break from uploading videos for a while? I'm sure the idea is stressful but you can really recharge and hopefully you'll feel a little bit more like you. Other than your honeymoon,  which you still Preshot videos for, when was the last time you had a real break?  P.s. With it not being as sunny where you live and since you've travelled to do many sunny places recently try a really good vitamin d supplement, it helped me adjust from the Cape Town sunshine to the Irish weather which literally made me sad and lethargic due to lack of sun. Also don't ever apologise for saying how you feel, it's better to be honest than pretend everything is perfect. No-one can live up to perfection.
Lily, I like that you've been really honest about feeling a bit down lately. This is real life and we all go through periods of feeling like we're uninspired or in a rut or lacking motivation, and that's ok. Thanks for keeping it real. I often find in moments like this it's important to grasp on to the things that do bring you joy until you start feeling a shift towards being 'yourself' again. Keep your chin up and I hope you'll feel better about things soon.
Yeah it is REALLY rude it's not nice at all
Hi Lily! You totally have to try Uriage Bariederm for your lips. I've tried averything for my sensitive, ezcema-prone lips and it is THE BEST. Love your videos!
I really appreciate the honesty in this! I'm a total home girl and love being a bit of a slob and taking my time to just be myself and do what I need to do! I think you look great! Homey videos are my favourite! I've watched you for years and love you and Anna's friendship and dynamic! Please tell me there will be another series of the podcast? When you're ready obviously and I really mean it when I say no pressure to continue! Just such interesting guests and I'm a bit nosy too! Take care of yourself and don't feel ashamed about being a bit selfish we all need a break from time to time or we burn out! Hope Mark enjoys the curry! I'm not a prawn fan but it looks delicious! Love Madeleine's recipes! Lamb and Sweet Potato stew is our personal fave and lasts a couple of days! X
Always good to know that one is not alone in feeling negative/under the weather. Some days get the worst out of us. As usual, love your vlogs Lily!
Have you ever tried Clinique all about lips? I find it really soothing when my lips are sore. Totally get you with the pregnancy stuff, I'm constantly getting asked when I'm going to have a baby. It's rude, what if there's a reason i haven't got children?!
Sending you happy thoughts ❤️😘 x
Feel better.
For your sore lips i recommend the bariederm balm by uriage! It's amazing for sensitive lips.
Lily I love your videos and watch every single one of them! I love it because of the realness of it whether you're in a negative mood or not. Im not annoyed by it I guess after watching you for years you are like a friend to me talking about everything in life or whinging about stuff which is perfectly normal between friends!
Found your comment on the whys of not commenting that someone looks pregnant to be the most direct, succinct, honest, polite and refreshing one I've seen.  As for feeling down, everyone does at times--whether or not they own it or not.  Love the honesty!
I'm one of your older fans (36), and I loved this video. I went through a 4 month period of feeling off and down and I'm finally coming out of it. Good luck! I felt a little lost so if you're feeling that way, I hope you find yourself and discover how to be good with life.
What nail polish are you wearing in this video? It looks great on you.
Thanks for keeping it real. It's a part of life to have highs and lows, it's great that you don't completely hide it all away. I'd much rather see an honest vlog than a fake one. Hope your days get brighter again soon.x
I don't normally comment but just wanted to say thank you for being honest & not pretending that everything is always sunshine & roses. This is why I like you - you're real & not trying to be something you're not. I can completely relate to the being down but not knowing why. Went through a horrible phase of it last year so I really hope you come out the other side soon for your own sake. \nAs for the pregnancy thing - I agree that it's so rude to speculate about someone publicly (not going to lie, with some of my friends I do think it!) as you don't know what's going on behind closed doors. \nStill love your videos & look forward to them 😊
I really don't feel like you have to say sorry for feeling like that. We all have days or periods like that. It's natural. Hope you feel better soon Lily, love you and Anna :) Love from Norway
Hi Lily, we must be twins because I have also been feeling quite down and overwhelmed of-late, further, I too am suffering from the same chapped/cracked/flaky lip condition for the past few weeks. Good news is that I found a method that helps to heal my lips - I hope you'll find it useful in some ways. :) First off, make sure to avoid using 'active' (i.e. acids) skincare + lip care items around/on your lip area. Your lip area is sensitised atm so you don't want to aggravate it further - instead, I use rosehip oil and sensitive-skin friendly moisturiser on the area. On the lips, especially before I go to bed, I generously coat my lip with an oil-based lip balm (again with no-actives; I used a shea butter based one myself) and then sealing my whole lip surface off with a balm/ointment like Lucas paw paw ointment (good thing these products are colourless otherwise I'd look quite like MirandaSings hahahahaha!!). These steps have really really helped to restore my lip to how it was before, I hope it helps. Last but certainly not least, big hugs to you Lily - this shall pass.... lots of love from Perth, Aus!
I alternated between wanting to bring you a cup of tea and offering you a shoulder. I feel like so many of us can not only sympathize but empathize with you as well. In fact, my co-worker and I had a discussion about wanting to crawl under our desks and hide from the world today. Don't ever feel like you have to put on a fake front. Just be you Lily. In terms of the baby conversation, oh boy. My wife and I have been together for 11 years and we only recently decided that even though we love children they simply aren't for us. Surprisingly our parents took the news wonderfully. Everyone else has been a hit or miss. We're very flattered that people think we'd make wonderful mothers, but that doesn't mean it's what we want.
You are such a lovely woman 😍😍
Hope you feel better 💕 I love your honesty, and don't worry about us/your viewers, you do you 👍 😘
We all have times when we are sad and it's ok to be. You shouldn't force yourself to look happy in videos. You're human just like us.
Life is too short to be doing big things you dislike or being around people that you do not want to communicate with. Give yourself permission to take a break and do more of the things you enjoy.  It will bring back your inner smile and help you focus on the things that truly matter to you.
It's so rude to say someone's glowing. I just hate that. I'd definitely rather look dull 😐
Unforunately these days in Italy it really feels like autumn, a lot of Wind and rain 😩
oh Lily, I love when you talk about this whole happiness/grumpiness thing! I'm lucky enough because where i spend most of my days everyone is complaining about everything anyways! I understand the pressure you feel to look like the other bloggers, who are super happy and content all the time. Congratulations on not giving in and doing the same! Congratulations on being still so authentic after all this time blogging. On a different note, I also struggle with my hair and the keratin/brazilian blowouts treatments. Could you do a video on what you have tried so far and your impressions on it? Have you ever actually done any real straightening treatments like those older ones with ammonia? Thank you!
I go through many sad moments and find it difficult to get out of the funk. I found it comforting that I'm not the only one.
Hi Lily - re your lips, I went through something v. similar, suddenly became allergic to some ingredients when I hit 30 - it's really worth seeing a dermatologist and seeing if patch testing would help - may not be the same thing for you but I know how annoying it is to suddenly struggle to wear lipstick!
I support you and appreciate you, Lily. Difficulties in life happen and it's not always something you want to share. Thanks for being open. I enjoyed the vlog. 💜
Lily, you're just so great :)
I always relate to you because of your lower energy, chilled out vibe. Take care of yourself and as always, thanks for sharing :)
I am inlove with that jumper, it looks like the cosiest thing ever!
Lily you really look depressed. I hope you can find some help.
Lily I love your videos and its so nice that you are real, I work from home and at the best of times I wake feeling so low and literally nothing makes me happy its fine and you are normal but because you have the public presence its more pressure....
A very relatable day! Even if you didn't feel cheery, your vlogs always brighten up my day! X
Dear Lily, I don't usually comment, but I watch every video you upload, so I thought it would be nice to express my support. I hate to hear you're feeling so negative lately. It must be hard to keep up with this kind of work when feeling down, but you're doing a great job and I love your videos! You should not apologise for your mood, I think it's perfectly normal for everyone to have better and worse phases in their life. \nI also agree that the pregnancy comments are terribly rude! My sister recently got a few of those comments and she was really insulted, and I could totally understand her - it's nobody's business! So just try to ignore them :)
Thank you Lily for speaking so openly, I haven't commented on here before but wanted to let you know I appreciate your honesty. We all have times we we feel low and it's so important to talk about our mental health.
Well done for being yourself. You are actually helping a lot of people. We all feel crap sometimes and talking about it is the key. In fact I prefer watching your vlogs when you are raw and real. I loved it :-)
Enjoyed your vlog.
You be YOU!
keep working out Lily.  the endorphins will improve your mental state.  I feel so sluggish when I don't work out. A good jump board session energizes me all day.  Its impossible to not feel better after a workout
Haha I love you and well done for figuring out the rice cooker! Win! I'm a sucker for Lily Pebbles vlogs. My absolute fave vlogger #1 please continue to vlog for the foreseeable future
Lily, I loved this vlog. I fully empathise with you, as I also don't feel all that great these days. I loved how you did lots of small things to cheer your self up a little. Very healthy and nice to watch. Lots of love xxxx
Moany and whingy hmmm. You're human! We go through shit. It's not all rainbows and sprinkles all day errday
Oh lily! I hope you are ok. Everyone goes through these types of moods and phases and I personally think it's good you are being honest and real! That's why I love you! And you don't look pregnant at all. You are right it's the hardest thing when people keep asking you and expecting you to announce something. I find it awful as we are trying to get pregnant with our second child and we struggled so much with our first and had to go through IVF and everytime someone asked me I just wanted to cry. Same as now.... Thank you for showing that you understand it's not easy for everyone and that you are sensitive to this. I'm sorry for you that people keep asking! Oh and I never comment on videos - I just wanted you to know I was thinking of you! X
so naturally pretty lily! thanks for the video x
Try changing your toothpaste. I got a reaction from a strong/ whitening one and my lips haven't been the same since!
Lily i think it's the change of season that's making you feel low. I honestly have been feeling the same very negative and i for sure think it's the winter blues! Love the honesty, after all you are human and can't possibly always be happy in life. Hope you feel better soon xx
Lily I loved this chatty video! Don't ever feel sorry for being your true, authentic self. It's beautiful.
Like you're Vlogs - speaking very well awesome Video
the christophe robin salt scrub is my favorite scrubbing shampoo and it smells amazing! you don't have to worry about getting anything gritty out of your hair because the salt will eventually dissolve under the spray of your shower
p.s. I know when I worked from home, I felt lonely. Maybe an office space shared with others would help?!
Lily, I truly appreciate you being honest about your feelings and conveying your real feelings rather then being superficial. This is especially important with social media constantly showing us how good other people have it....we all feel down at times and it's so refreshing to hear someone else who feels the same way that I do sometimes. Just this Tuesday I was so sad and anxious and I didn't have any reason. Listening to you today made me feel so much better \n❤️
A good scalp scrub is baking soda! It works suuuper well, just make sure you condition afterwards. Gets rid of flakes and product buildup.
I'm sorry you don't feel up to par. We all have these days. Maybe we all tend to be this way, too, but I find you complain an awful lot sometimes. There's nothing wrong with it. Just my opinion.
Try the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask - it's incredible.
I normally don't reply on your videos. I watch them to learn and they are good but this blog was pants. Keep reading...not the part where you express your thoughts and feelings, kudos for that. What I found shallow and a little condescending was the non interest in Fenty Beauty. I am about 10 years your elder and American, so I don't always meld with your taste but give you a listen and I learn somethings. Today as a subscriber I felt let down by that flippant attitude. I could be wrong, people don't come for me, it's not worth it, but this is how I saw you today.
I know that you're conscious that you may not come across as being incredibly chipper or bubbly in your videos; but one of the reason I'm subscribed to you and keep watch is because of your realness. It's nice to see how honest you are unapologetically human quite frankly! You come across in a genuinely relatable way which is refreshing. I also love that you check people that ask of assume that someone is pregnant - you're so right about online etiquette! I too feel that fruit flies are the bane of my life right now! Thanks for sharing Lily, much love 💜 x
Hi Lily, I had similar lip issues to yours and after months of trying to figure them out I realized I'm allergic to beeswax, which is found in 99% of lip balms and some lipsticks. It took me a while to realize it was beeswax because I had been using lip balms with it my whole life and never had any problems with it until this year, but apparently it's an allergy you can develop at any time. \nSo far I've only found two lip balms that don't contain any: LUSH None of your Beeswax and Crazy Rumors. Since I started using these and avoiding any other lip products with beeswax, I haven't had any more problems with my lips. I hope this helps! :)
Personally, I find you so much more 'real' than other youtubers. I don't mind the ranting, or grumbling, it's really refreshing actually! Keep on being you, that's why we like you! Your videos are almost like hanging out and catching up with a friend, with bits of travel, makeup, and fashion thrown in. Also total side note, as a fellow curly-haired girl I know you love your hair straight, but I'm so curious so see what it would be like styled with a good curling mousse or gel!
Oh my God about that Fenty *****!! Am sick and tired of all youtube reviewing it;using it,testing it !! I swear I was about to go crazy,I swear I will never buy anything from Fenty Beauty! never ,people go crazy man! And I was sure you aint one, as an old subscriber ,I know ur classy anyway, dont mean to be rude towards Rihannas line ,but people makes you hate it!!*\nAnd Lily, hope you will feel better soon :))) thank you for your honesty, you're amazing the way you are :)))
Weak Graphics, weak roster, and some cheap dollar store easter eggs for $200? Yikes they shot themselves in the leg with this one
They should just use actual rocks/stones.
Lol they look like one of them fake ass Chinese toy ripoffs😂
Wow I can't believe my dad wasted money on this like tf we already spent like 55k renovating our fucking house.
Brave yourselves for the expectation vs reality memes for those infinity stones.
and the game isnt even included damn, that's some scam right there\nnothing looks like the pictures gdi\nfigures are REALLY poor same for the stones.. looks like easter egg
HOW THE F CAN ANYONE DEFEND THIS CRAP
what a fucking piece of shit deluxe edition, the gems are a fucking joke and you cant even take them out (not that anyone would like to anyway)
200$ and they cant be bothered to give your some fucking batteries.
figures lol. they're statues.
those 200.00 eggs.
Lol look like shit
Now I know why X-men and Fantastic Four characters are not in this game...this game don't deserve they! Gimme moar DBFighterZ!!!
Infinite Eggstones Lol\n\nI don´t knew barbie´s company work with Capcom
I want to verbally attack you for now knowing they are on Rainbow Road, but those Power Gems look like absolute shit.
How much were you paid for this review? I actually canceled my collector's edition pre-order due to the horrible quality of this set.
People are actually excited for this game? THis game looks like something Cacom threw together in a few months slap the MvC name to it and hope for a lot of sales....
Wow thank god i cancelled my preorder those infinity stones are horrible
NO HSIEN-KO I CRY....I ALREADY BOUGHT IT. RIP ME.
I made a very bad decision.
I only came here for X\nam dissapoint
Cant wait for this to come out too excited infinity eggs are a meh but the rest is good
in the UK with retailer GAME they're doing the collector's edition, but not just any collector's edition. You've got the choice of the standard collector's or the deluxe collector's. With the standard £155 you get the statues and the game (no steelbook), and that's it. Deluxe collector's you get everything you're supposed to get with the collector's, statues, steelbook, all the DLC for £185. You'd think if you looking for a collector's edition it'd be just the one and also, if you're paying £155 you'd think you'd get everything. Plus I've seen in America, when convert dollars to pounds it's £150. Fuck GAME.
So much negativity.  I am excited.  Reply if you got ps4 I'll add u we can play
why are you using a butcher knife to break the tape
Absolutely disgusting
I don't really care about this game or anything in the collectors edition, Except for X!
THAT WAS A REAAALLY BAD UNBOXING VIDEO, you can see he doesnt have any experience doing those haha, just the way he opened the thing that had the figures x_x
I cancelled my edition bc those infinity stones are so ugly!
The camera placement for this vid is not great.  Honestly I'm with most of you, the case and the stones look so cheap even with 20% off on Best Buy it isn't worth it.
Wooow that's fucking bad. I saw pics on twitter but they look even worse in the video.
4:16 What the hell? Is that a sound effect added in?
I pity the poor saps who got the collectors edition.
Yeah this is bull I’m about to cancel my CE May keep it but this is BS, I guess the statues are worth it tho....
It's because the color bands on the base are the Asgard stage and it's on the road to Asgard which is normally a bridge, a rainbow bridge specifically but since X's world has fused with Thor's home world thanks to Ultron Sigma well it looks more like a highway road and not a total rainbow bridge
Why did they use chun li? You would think they would give you ryu since the first trailer was iron man mega man captain marvel and ryu.
thats bull crap yall get that for free jesus
So they know that X exist but they will not give us a new megaman x game. uhh silly silly capcom
You just saved me 200+ bucks so glad I seen this before the game came out. I already canceled my pre-order. as thanks I will sub to you guys.
The figures actually look pretty good, which is suprising considering everything else about this game.
ill buy this once the x-men are added in.. or if Captain Commando, Jin, Hayato, and Amingo come as dlc
Like the figures.... not the stones.. You cant even take them out the case.... going to cancel my pre-order. Not really worth it in my opinion.
Those are the street roads in the game that's why it's cold that way in those  infinity stones probably look cheap but when they light up they probably will have lines coming out of them making them look like stone   And I'm going to definitely   Pick up mine but it's too bad wolverine  X 23 iron in the game I guess that's what happens when Disney owns a lyses they ruined everything
Bro it was this special edition sucks. Infinite is garbage compared to the rest. Huge disappointment to me.
so the toys are cheap as the game? yeap Capcom.
They should've just made it 100,- and only added 2 statues. Low quality, and the pricing is way too much.
5:59  Good thing I didn't waste $200 on this.  The Infinity Stones being not as pictured.  I bet if Crapcom replied to complaints, they're basically going to say something that will sound like The yolk's on you, morons.  Your money belongs to us now.
Awful awful CE only a delusional fan boy would consider this a great CE
2:03 WARNING! There is a Maverick inside!
What is up with those Infinity eggs they look nothing like the box art!\nExpectations: Crystal clear translucent looking stones\nReality: Poorly painted easter eggs.
Isn't this false advertising? Can't you sue for this kind of thing
These toys look like the ones you get on a happy meal lol good thing i canceled my pre order on this shit i knew it was not worth $200
There's a lot in there It better be, this thing costs 200 dollars
The one I'm personally least interested in is Captain Marvel\nUh oh. Better watch out that those Disney lawyers don't flag your video! :D
the figures look cheap but pretty well detailed. nothing  like RE5 snow globe level bullshit. the infinity stones however look like fucking dollar store plastic easter eggs
No wonder he isn't mad, he got it for free
Game is worth a buy, but not the CE
Wtf is with the easter eggs?
I don't care about the infinity stones, just the X figure and the Steelbook.
It looks like all four figures can connect with each other together.
The stones are the worst lol
The denial in his voice hurts. If you spent 200$ You dont have a reason to be too upset wew boi
I preordered the collectors edition a minute after it went live, then after watching IGN un-box it a month ago I cancelled it.\n\nThey look like a joke! What's worse is the original awesome design photo is on the cover of the box. \nThey couldn't even change the picture on the box to resemble how shit they look.\n\nI upgraded to just the deluxe. Even though I love MvC the game does look shit in comparison to UMvC3 but this is honestly the worst collectors edition flop I've ever seen.
Holy shit that looks horrible I was thinking of getting the ce but changed to destiny 2 and assassins creed thank gosh I wasn't dumb I knew something wasn't right with this one
are you sure it is sold 200$ in the USA ??? cos for once we got a better deal in EU... in France i preordered mine and got it for 109€ .... weird gap ....
The infinity stones look nothing like the actual stones, they could've at least made them more realistic, but why were they so lazy to make the stones  look cheap and tacky
Don't blame Capcom for this crap, blame Marvel they only want their movie characters in the games. They wanted people getting hyped for the infinity stones because of the upcoming movies will feature them. But you can't make great games based too much on movie content so blame Marvel for making this game series crappy.
So glad i prefer to spend my money into more comics. At least are much better than this piece of useless TRASH!
X's eyes look stupid and the figures look like large shity amibos. I don't like the Infinity Gem set, thank jebus I cancelled my order.
The game looks better than those infinity stone and those stones look better than chun li's face before the patch. smh
Rainbow Bands are from the rainbow road on X-Guard
Didn't know Mr Krabs got into the gaming business, those infinity stones look like shit.
I'm happy this CE only cost me $71 from Best Buy. After seeing what was shown here vs official images, the quality is not what I'd expected. Oh well, nice addition to the collection for about the cost of a new game.
I wonder if those Infinity Eggs has something inside.
Watching this video reminds me of the 40 year old Virgins apartment.
How much gb doses it have
Those stones look terrible ! what a rip off lol , so happy I didn't buy this collectors edition , For $200 the people who bought this should get Season 1 and season 2 of DLC for free . The stones just look like cheap plastic Easter eggs , Nothing like how they were advertised,Here is a comparison Image. https://i.imgur.com/2HE0HxB.jpg
When you gonna do a livestream Mr. Ketchum? Derrick's cornering the market.
Lol talk about false advertisement, those stones look like ass
Carlton: Still playing with dolls will?\n\nWill:  ACTION FIGURE, ACTION FIGURE
i wonder if i can find that mega man seperate. cuz its the only good thing here
Lmao wtf those infinity stones
canceling pre order mine after see this lol
Looks super cheap LMAOOO
Aha hahaha hahaha fucking capcom
wow, how much this crap cost?
cheap stuff
DOLLAR STORE EASTER EGGS
ahahahhahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Easter came early
Mvci catfish edition
Garbage
Why do you guys buy trash?
Uuhhh... uhhh... uhhh...
Got 'em
Wow....\n\nGreat statues and Infinty Easter Eggs....
2 hundred dollars? Suckers only!
Sorry Carol Danvers fans\n\nHA! What fans?
The silly children in the comments section failed to notice that the Collector's edition includes the season pass that comes with 6 characters. How laughable, especially the illegitimate criticism this game is facing that has no objective leg to stand on.
Xmen? No okay bye
Hey I hope you enjoy this new video! Some 370 of you got to see this early as I accidentally pressed the button that I didn't mean to press so the video was live for about a minute this morning, but here's the real version!\n\nMake sure to check out Squarespace because this video *literally* would not have happened without their support.
Middle of the market, the 757 is hard to replace, such a great aircraft. Liked that you used many -300 series clips too haha
Hello I'd just like to say that I admire your videos very much and they are actually my main source of a template for how to structure the videos that I make at school as part of projects. I've seen almost every video you've made and I hope you continue to make great content. Idk how you do it, no matter what the topic is I look forward to the next Wendover productions video because I somehow am always completely engrossed by whatever you're talking about! Keep making great and interesting videos!
Like Hyperloop\nI would recommend checking out a science channel by the name of thunderf00t. They've debunked it pretty damn well.
@ 2:50 HAHAHAHAHAHA! Airlines don't give a shit about passenger comfort.  If anything, they more likely want a new plane that can fit in more passengers per square foot by decreasing leg room even further.
why create an entirely new aircraft instead of modernize the 757 to a 757Max? i just don't get ist. it would save money because of the similarity of the models exactly like 737classics/NGs and Max.
This is only really an American problem,  no where else was the 757 as popular. Everywhere else they don't need this place type in the world and is why neither Boeing or Airbus have created a new type. And lets be honest, long haul travel in a single isle plane is terrible.
pilots will always be there incase the system fails, and on average they fly about 5 minutes w/o auto pilots, and some of the newer planes can land them selfs
Nah, bullshit.
great video!
Preparing for a world without oil??? your kidding right? or at the very least ill informed. Have you never heard of algae oil? It has already flown.
As long as they don't remove the sound, i'm fine with it.
the plane of the future will carry 500-600 people on average, without seats. more like a subway car. there will be a few seats but they will cost 2-10x what standing room will cost. flights will on the whole be 30% slower but the loading and unloading time will be so long it won't matter.
what do i do with this information
Small plane commuting doesn't seem like it can take off. Airports are designed to process very high amounts of people who easily have an hour to get through security. Also, you need public transport just to reach the airport. To commute by plane, you would need to reshape the world and city layouts.
Jet of the future a fighter jet that a kill anything all the way around the world and it doesn't Evan have to take off jet of the juture
Trains cheaper than planes for 200-400 miles? Really.  Check prices of budget airlines in the UK from London->Scotland and the comparable train prices!
Seaweed is being used to create fuel which seems as good as I expected
the problem with short range domestic flights is that you aways have to add check-ins, security procedures and travelling back and forth from the airport. trains will never have this problem.\n\nto bring an example, take to Rome-Milan route (assuming you destination is Milan central station):\n1)by train you have to go to the station (which takes 20 to 40 minutes by metro) 10 minutes before departue, then it's 3:20 or 2:55 hours (depending on the train) to arrive at Milan central station \n2)by plane: go to the airport (at least 40 minutes), go trough security check (10 to 20 minutes), be borded (30-40 minutes), fly (50 minutes), exit the plane and go to the central station (30 to 50 or more minutes depending on which aiport and traffic).\n\nfinal time: \ntrain: 4 hours on average\nplane: 3:20 hours (assuming you do everything with little spare time)\n\nif they can't reduce boarding times and stuff like that it's unikly they'll ever compete with the train
Teleporters would put all airlines out of business
No word on thec chineese Comac? Feels like they are going to have an impact on the market simply by state subsidy..

If solar panels became super efficient, they could build an airliner that has really long range. In fact, it would just keep flying, following the sun. Then they could load and unload passengers like aerial refueling. That's the future!!!!
ah cool saw clip of N323AS getting refueled. Iv been on that plane before!
I would say the A350 XWB would be a great replacement for the 757 ? efficient, has a massive range and can carry enough passengers to make it worth while .
I'm not quite sure, after doing very little research, if they have chosen an engine provider for this design. I work for an aviation company as a tube fabricator and I believe that ultimately Boeing will go with the more well known product. Our market share is and will continue to grow. The Paris Air Show was a huge success for us, and our demand is through the roof. Everybody has to travel...
0:33 bitch be texting for then 50 minutes
Lol the train from London to Edinburgh is both more expensive and less convenient than flying. That's why I chose the BA flight for a recent trip. Flyby may have been even faster, but BA is so much nicer.
I'm not sure we have 15-20 years left.
Regional flights might be quicker....but air security will take you about an hour of your time. 30 minute flight + 1 hour at security. No...I'd rather take the train.
All Airbus needs to do is to release an A310neo and Boeing 797 will be *cooked*.
I just checked the times for the BA A320 flight from Edinburgh to London and the same flight for Fly Be with their D8D. TIme is the same about 65-70 minutes for BOTH. So you are lying. You simply cant compare it this way. Planes dont fly at maximum speed they have cruising speed. Moreover on this specific flight D8D reaches usually cruising altitude of 25000 feet while A320 BA reaches cruising altitude of 33 000 feet. Different cruising altitude in this case is there for better fuel efficiency of both planes. While D8D uses the 25 000 feet as the maximum altitude the Airbus goes higher to achieve better fuel efficiency. And finally on such a short flight it is obvious that the Airbus wont be there much earlier because of earlier descent and on such a short flight you cant see the difference even though the Airbus cruises about 200-250km/h faster than D8D.\nThree of your last videos are really meh...
Do a video about concept planes such as the x-57 Maxwell and the Boeing Blended Wing body and their potential impact on the industry
When you're talking about trains and electric planes, you have to consider that the American train system is awful everywhere else than the Northeast, so they could potentially dominate the market in the Western united States
I always love seeing my old co-worker Dennis on these videos fueling airplanes.
Wouldn't an A330 or perhaps an A321 be considered a similar replacement for the ageing 757's? I get that it's a different manufacturer and therefore added base costs on maintenance but it's still  a viable option, no?
I think there is too much overlap between capacities and sizes even today, why not just use a 787-8 and carry less fuel?
Short distances the high speed train will always win door to door due the time you have to spend at airports before and after flying and the location of airports outside major cities. For example center of London to center of Paris on Eurostar is 2 hrs 16 min.  Flight time London to Paris is 1hr 20 min plus getting to and from the airports, Plus booking in and security.
United Airlines is plane boring. Also, there is no such thing as a 797. Nothing beats the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
I wonder if soon flying across the Atlantic may become cheaper than $200
You never mentioned the Boeing 747-40, which I am told is dying out, even though I still see loads of them at all of the airports I go to. Can someone elaborate on this please?
Short-haul flight doesn't make a lot of sense... if the city doesn't have a small, more accessible airport.\n\nAnyone who has commuted from London to Heathrow, from NYC to JFK knows that. The commute itself is almost 1 hour with another 1.5 hour check-in time.
Isn't the plane of the future just a car or did we give up on the whole flying car thing?
Wow, Boeing is building a new cattle car for the sky! YAY!
Umm...planes are already cheaper than buses in a lot of markets
This is a similar thing they said about the Concorde, which could travel 2x the speed of light
Are aircraft manufacturers ever again going to build a plane that doesn't look like a facsimile of the 737.... ever??
Edinburgh to London is far cheaper to fly, the state of trains in the UK is abysmal.
The plausibility of electric transports has to be considered in question until it is proven not. The most plausible version of the idea, I suppose, is a fuel cell, but a fuel cell does not eliminate the need to carry the fuel necessary to support powered flight. I am not sure about the idea of short haul airplanes replacing the train. The airport has to be gotten to and there has to be screening and boarding. All of this means the process of flying inevitably has to be extremely time consuming even if the time in the air is brief. Boarding an intercity train, even for a trip of some hours, need not be more complicated than boarding a bus or a commuter train. The problem with the train, at least in the United States, is that issue of providing short and medium haul train service is tied to plethora of hobbyhorse issues, notably the idea of downtown-to-downtown service. The problem is, downtowns have their drawbacks. They are often are congested and hard to get into and out of and that they may no longer have the infrastructure necessary to provide for the needs of travelers, especially accommodations and car rental.\n\nThe state of California, where I live, right now is spending tens of billions of dollars building a high speed rail line through rural Central California which most likely will end of being a train to nowhere for many decades to come. In reality, the state could set up commuter-grade service between Los Angeles and the Bay Area with stops in San Jose, Salinas, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ventura and Burbank within literal weeks if the will was there. Notably, all accommodations would be available on both ends of the run due to proximity to already operating airports. No, I don't think short haul airplanes are a real competitor to trains, provided the trains are sited properly. At or near airports or in suburban locations would be better options for the end terminals that this downtown-to-downtown idiocy. In between, the existing terminals of the smaller cities would be adequate. VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) could change this picture somewhat, but it could be pricey and an option only for the high end traveler.
Boeing 777 X don't fail me now!
The airliner of the future will be a single engine powered aircraft. It will start life as a short distance carrier over land in order to prove its viability/safety/reliability but will eventually gain some kind of an TESOPS  ( The Engine Spins Or People Swin )rating allowing it to travel great distances over water just as the twin engine powered airliners of today proved themselves.
Well from what I have seen much lighter carbon fibre composite planes with much improved engine efficiency and wing span profile improvements are fast approaching are set to be the the next step in aviation advancement.\n\nTho I think we should also look at having hybrid solar planes... we already have light aircraft making use of solar tech and much more efficient solar panel tech on the way.
Can you please make a video about how flights get their flight numbers.
find your airline videos rather insightful, if you ever have time any idea what happens to flights when they get disrupted from hurricanes? because that throws airlines into chaos
You forgot about the A321LR... It has the range of a 757, maybe even more, and seats approx. 200
we never say that word united
Wendover Productions? More like Bendover Productions. Just like that and you're a subsidiary of Brazzers well done 👍
Wait, so Airbus already has a 757 competitor? And nobody's buying it? That makes no sense.
SOOOOOOO Much Boeing bias in this video! Lots more companies then Boeing, you have Airbus, Bombardier and more!
Do a video tackling the gulf carriers!
The video is phenomenal. Thank you!\n\nIt is phenomenal even you said electric motors are weak. They are the most powerful motors ever created ;). In power plants 3 turbines often move a single electric motor more that 1MW power ;).
never say edinburgh again please
Damn, I clicked on this hoping to be watching a video full of those planes in the beginning of the video, but this is so.. real..  It's like clicking on a video called The Car of the Future and the video goes into depth on the 2019 Toyota Camry. Yes, I guess that is technically the future, but it's not future enough, and it's pretty boring.
Over here in the UK train tickets are so expensive that it is often cheaper to fly. Or people just take a coach which is dirt cheap.
Train prices in the UK are ballooning so much that in some routes I've travelled it's cheaper already by the plane.\nFlybe Manchester to Southampton for instance.
The plane of the future needs everything you said in the beginning except for personal jets for everyone. For 200. dollars you can go anywhere in the world in 1-4 hrs on the plane of the future. Now what we need is trains of the future.

2:90 the 777x
Im suprised people still fly united.
The 787 is the Middle Spot aircraft it is for long skinny routes. The 787 was created just to replace 757, not the 777. The 737 MAX was not made to replace the 757. It's purpose is to refresh the 737 series. The 797 will be a high capacity short range aircraft for routes such as New York to Los Angeles, and New York to Chicago. There is no need for electric aircraft at this point, we still have enough gas at this point to have no demand for an electric aircraft. Plus switching to electric would be a huge fundamental change in aviation no one was asking for. The a350 and the 787 will be sufficient for the next 20-50 years.
Why theres no 777?
did you seriously just mention the hyperloop? LOL
I expected better from the Boeing 797. Also, who's a Boeing fan?
How about the A350-900???🤔🤔
Boeing fan I smell
2017 and it still takes 14 hours to fly from one end to another, people should teleport by now i dont know what went wrong
Airbus a321ER?
THIS VIDEO WOULD BE BETTER IF YOU WERENT SUCH AN AMERICAN ASSHOLE SPEAKING OF BOEING ONLY. Best regards from the rest of the fucking world.
electric aircraft is like cold fusion. NEVER GONNA HAPPEN!
But airbus 350 is the most fuel efficient now...
lol dont worry, hyperloop is NOT a threat to any transportation.
Fuck I want a plane

I looooooooove the colours of the blue/ green/ gold one!!
I had a big ol' smile the entire time I watched this video! What an adorable idea!! <3
I am going to have to do this with my pigeon!
Louie looks like Dewey from Malcolm in the Middle
aww so cute. rats are really underrated pets
These videos are by far my favorite videos. I love seeing your rattie!🐀 He's so cute I hope you do so many more video with him and about him that would mean so much! Keep up the amazing work and the awesome videos beautiful😍😍😍😍 Much love from Alaska❄⛄
What a lovely idea. I've been recording and creating videos of my rats after watching rat channels on here so they'll always live on in a little part of the internet. But turning pet paws into art is a fantastic idea to keep them part of the world! \n\nThank you for this idea <3
Would you be able to paint his little feeties with the food colouring alone? Then it might not crack away and give you a higher colour saturation xx
I love this!!! \nI really want to do this with my cat baby now! \n🖤
I wish I could've done this with my little baby, but he passed away about a week ago on the 11th.
This is so cute. Now I want to do this with my babies (2 German shepherds).
Omg it's so cute! So now we know why Louis​ is so creative, he got it from his mum :D and the poo is just his personal special signature
I need help\nI got 2 new rats \nStorm and Karkat Karkat is mega scared for me can you maybe make a video of about how to get a rat to like you I'm scared he will never like me and will keep on running away from my hand 😢
This is so adorable!! 😭😭😭 I want to do this with all of my little animal babies
Aw look at his little old man feet. He's adorable and was a very well behaved stamp. Mine would have me and the house covered in paint but not the paper! I actually got a print of one of my boys just after he passed, I wanted to keep a print of them all. But I forgot so only did 1 which sucks. But think I'll start from now on to do alongside my photos of them in my memories scrapbook. This was so cute x
More what I eat in a day/week PLEASE!!!!
Oh this is so cute!!! can i ask what font did you use on the 'painted by' bit? thanks in advance!
This is so cute, I wanna try this with my ratties <3
i really liked the editing style of this video.
I was unsubscribed to this channel and missed this video. I had to subscribe again. What is going on with Youtube??. This is so cute, yeah defiantly do another one. I'm glad you framed it what a beautiful thing to do.😊
This video is so lovely! Thank you for uploading it. ❤️
I love your videos
Get another rat please I mean... You should get another rat...
you should make an etsy shop!!
We love you so much!!
It came out amazing 💕🐁
I lost one of my ratty girls this time last year that I was very close to. Before we lost her, we pressed her feet into a soft piece of fimo, baked it and then had it silver plated and popped in a frame. Little more expensive way of doing things, but she was worth it, and now we have little silver pawprints to remember her by 🐀 (you could always paint the baked fimo or leave it as it is too)
yeeeees!! a beautiful video with the beautiful little lou bean <3 loved this
Watching this weirdly enough comforted me. Been crying since my other half is traveling for 3 weeks from today and anxiety has kicked in (the whole what if this happens to him? Or omg what if he doesn't come back). So thank you for this. It really calmed me 🙂
This is BRILLIANT!!! What a awesome idea, thank you. I'm getting my boys and doing this RIGHT now lol. And my dogs as well and my mouse..
I had to say goodbye to my gorgeous baby hammy today and I'm feeling pretty devastated. This video was precious, and really soothed me.🐹✨😘
oh goodness i'm crying at that little card, so cute!!
Aw I want a little Louie! I'm warming to rats since watching your videos 😊 just need to find rats from a nice home or place first xx
This was such a lovely video :') <3
Such a beautiful video!\nWhat brand of watercolor paint do you use? Where did you get your water color brush(es)?
You are such a lovely human. I'd love to drink tea with you and have ratty cuddles xx
Aw, what a well behaved stamp indeed! I'm not sure if it would require too much pressure, but maybe imprint his paws in some clay?
I did this with my hamster and I ended up just diluting the food coloring with water and soaking a paper towel with the mixture. That way he could just keep running though the colors and on to the paper. Worked really nicely and didn't fade! If you try it again I recommend this method ❤️
This was such a precious idea! 💕\n\nI was also a rat mother for three years. My little man's name was Moon and I plan on getting a tattoo for him in the near future. He had two sisters, Starlight and Dreamer, but they did not make it because they were weened off of their mother too early. Moon was a fighter and he made it, then he made my life grand. My father originally got them as food for one of our reptiles, but they were just too cute and my father then switched all of our lizard's food to frozen mice, eggs, and crickets. Moon came into my life at a really important time, I was 17 years-old and had gotten some bad news about my health. So he made me a mother and he was the best pet ever. I wish I had done a cute little art project like this with him.\n\nThank you so much for sharing your and Louie's adventures and love with us. ❤️
This is such a lovely video :) my girlfriend and I have 4 rats, Kronos, Zeus, Hades and Poseidon. I've been looking for a gift idea for her and she happens to adore the rats, so this is something I could give her as a gift :)
This is an adorable idea... I think I know what my little rat is doing this weekend.
What a great idea! I'll have to do this with my kitties!
yup, definitely doing this tonight with my girls. I don't have food coloring but I think beetroot juice and some butterfly pea tea will do just fine.
I misread this as painting WITH ratson, idea for better video
PLEASE MAKE MORE RAT VIDEOS HE IS SUCH A GOOD BOY
Beautiful! Loved this idea! Makes me want to do this with my corgi.
Little rat paw prints would make such a cute small tattoo!
I love this so much, ratties are such beautiful little creatures, and it's wonderful to see I'm not the only one who's a crazy rat mumma! So adorable ❤️
Maybe just test out the non toxic paints before you subject Lou to it haha. Test it on the paper you intend to use and nail polishes or other clear preservatives over top to see if it holds. (I never think of this shit before I try new things either) I thought you were going to lay down a cardboard maze with the paper underneath it with a thin layer of paint near the beginning which he would track through. You could make one cardboard maze, rotate it, put a different paint near the start, and even if you didn't get good prints you would have paint scuffles that have an artistic winding to them. \n\nMy personal anecdote related to paw painting: I was in the living room of a rental painting with India ink on the table. I don't even remember what I was drawing! So I finish up, mostly clean up and go take a shower. I never know what to do with the remaining watered down India ink. I'm not going to pour it back in but it seems a waste to toss it. So I left it out on the table. I go into my room after my shower and realize my cat, who never does this, is under my bed. He seems distressed. I realize there's a few India ink paw print tracks in my room and the living room and the table. It made me laugh so much. I managed to clean it all up, except for a blurred par print on the stone of the propane fireplace. So he left his mark there. (And I did get my deposit back). I almost wish he had tracked it over paper so I could have kept it. He also luckily didn't get sick. It was pretty cute to see him ashamed. It was so unusual and so interesting that he seemed to grasp the concept that he did something wrong.
Omg that is such a good idea! I might do that with my kitty, probably have to leave a trail of treats for her to do it but it'd be fun. \nWish we did that for my sister's and my previous pet ratties and miceys. Sadly my sister's eldest rat Jerry passed away this evening :( Lou reminds me alot of him actually, such a cutie pie he was. He's in ratty heaven now with his brother Ben (they was names after the brand Ben & Jerrys icecream).
This is so sweet! Such a lovely idea, I might have to have a go with my pets... although the horse will be rather interesting to do...
I started with a hamster, and I have mice now... but it's gonna have to be ratties next! I love him!!!! <3
This is so precious I'm crying aaaaa it came out so well 😭❤️
This video is so precious! I love it! (^_^)
you are sooooo creative :) you have to get one of your leaf drawings tattooed
That is the cutest bloody thing! 💕
LOVED this video! It was so sweet to see such a special moment between you and Louis. :) Perhaps my favorite video of yours all year! <3
More painting with Louis! I love it
I love all your videos but this is just so cute, it's such an original idea as well 😊❤️
I was just going to add next time maybe just mash up some blueberries and raspberries to use as paints? It would have more of a watercolor effect but could be more effective when drying and safe for little bean to lick himself clean! :D Loved this video and I want to try it with my boys now too <3 xo
I am gonna do this with my rats! 💖🐀
Watching this with my 4 rattos clambering over me. Must try something similar, they're really lovely.
Next time you could try using really well mashed blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, or pomegranates. All of them should be completely safe for him to eat and they stain really well. I've tried painting with them before and would recommend doing a test on paper to see what you like most because the colors will change as they dry. They might stain his fur for a bit though.
Painted by Lou and mum 😭 that is the cutest!!! Xx
This is such a sweet and creative idea! Lou is so adorable, such a sweet little rat 🐀. They look awesome and I love the little card 🌟. Such a cute picture 💖.
This is the most precious thing I've ever seen I would buy these pieces done by a beauty and a bean ❤️
this is the best video i've ever seen
oh my goooooood. i wanna do this with my babies. but they are not as keen on being held without having their feet supported... so cute <3
Oh goodness, his feet are SO CUTE!
Kiera- I need to thank you so so so much for this video. 1)i love rats 2) your painting was so good so so nice. This idea made me tear up a little, because its so much more than a picture. It's something ur little rat touched and made. I will do this with my pets. <3
awww this is so sweet!! what a talented little bean! I want to do this with my two girls now :') <3
I'm crying this is so cute!!! You are such a great rattie mum! Staying home to be with him is the sweetest :))))))
Sooo cute <3
Your videos are so pieceful ☺

your rat really needs another rat friend. im sure you can find another male around the same age.
Can someone please explain to me how this is trending? Only has 11k views
I hope Louie lives forever! 😘
omg... all of the other rats passed away i am sooo sorry i literally starting sobbing once i heard that i loved ur pet rats sm now i feel bad for always saying more rat videos more rat videos i am so sorryyyy ;((((((((((

It's been shown that typically your native language is lost within 3 generations if you live in another country. I hate how ignorant my relatives and parents are. If you primarily speak English in public for 15 plus years youre gonna lose your language a bit no shit. I mean that's the whole idea of school isnt it. Now on the other hand in can still speak and understand my native tongue but i dont diss on people who can't because I understand its only bound it happen.

Automatic For The People changed my life.
Probably my favourite album of all time ! :-)
my all-time favorite r.e.m. album.  i only listen to the album on rainy days.
This album is a real masterpiece. Thank you R.E.M.
Beautiful album, great memories
Where’s Michael?
This album makes me wanna turn photographer, work with art, create something that matters.... Thank you REM!
Yesssssss
Where's Bill? A big part of this album seemingly deleted from history.
Wow! Two of the most impressive alternative rock albums of all time are getting re-released this year. R.E.M's #Automatic25 and The Smiths #TQID Both are on the list of my all time favorites.
When Peter says nothing else that came out that year sounded like that I was thinkingUm Yeah?! That's why you guys were great! Same could be said for Out of Time or Life's Rich Pageant, etc. A band that can write Wendell Gee and Turn you Inside Out, I mean, come on. As for AFTP Star me Kitten and Find the River get me every time. Millsey's background vocals are legend.
They never went wrong with Scott Litt. The best producer ever right after George Martin ! Good interviews with Peter and Scott !
I'm hating this video solely due to the fact that they whacked a honking great big preview add on their imitation of life video. Please get rid of it.
One of the greatest albums of all time
Magic, I will be getting this, well done including demos and particularly photograph 👍🏻
25 years. This music is still in my heart. Forever!
Wow! The deluxe edition sounds incredible! Dream scenario right now would be having an awesome surround sound stereo and a weekend to listen to all of their 25th anniversary editions.
Bem que eles poderiam fazer um turne de despedida
Phenomenal work
YEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAA BWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Greetings from Chile

Thank you
Meu álbum favorito!
Ignoreland 🤦🏻‍♂️
Lindo.📀🎵🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶
I bought AFTP in 1995- I was fourteen.  I would listen to it through headphones and I'd cry myself to sleep...but not because it brought me sadness--  it was just so beautiful.  Try Not to Breathe still makes me cry every time I listen to it.
OK, I've finally settled on my ranking of R.E.M albums from best to worst, and wish to share it with the world:\n\n1.) FIVE WAY TIE: Chronic Town/Murmur/Reckoning/Fables of the Reconstruction/Life's Rich Pageant\n2.) Out of Time\n3.) Monster\n4.) THREE WAY TIE: Document/Green/Automatic for the People\n5.) TWO WAY TIE: Up/Accelerate\n6.) THREE WAY TIE: New Adventures in Hi-Fi/Around the Sun/Collapse into Now\n7.) Reveal\n\nI'd enjoy a fierce debate with fellow YouTubers :)
Not their best album, but still cool.
I'm not sure those chicken breasts are juicy enough. Sorry.
Throw that into the onion?

Your videos used to be soo much funnier and actually informative. Nowadays you just put butter on toast with a 2 minute song and some sponsors. You're going downhill homie.
anyone else see the ant at 5:50

Thats all is look so delicious but there so funny vidios
Why do you sound like real life Tina Belcher
I feel like this Crack head is actually in culinary classes
How is it you've done this for so long without a decrease in entertainment?
Yea well you suck at making more videos, you should work on that by making more
Damn. I was really expecting that ladybug to get blown over like the last one. Stupid ladybug.
Let's have more fun with the different breeds of chicken like fried chicken, popcorn chicken, buffalo chicken (or buffalo wings?), or chicken cordon bleu.
How do I not suck at cooking hot dogs?
Has anyone actually tried any of these recipes? If so are they any good?
when is the next casually explained episode
I'm late again god dammit

That car needs a big wash.
Why do you sound like my English teacher? 😂
Anyone else wondering what's  next in the egg saga of John and Douglas
You have inspired me to cook more and eat more... I never ate a pirogi before I saw your pirogi episode.... now there one of my favorite foods..
Okay but so, the serious instructions in this actually worked. I cooked chicken breast for the first time the other and it turned out perfectly. Going again today.

Peas be with you.
I laughed SOOOOO hard at the juicy chicken squirt! Dude, LAUGHED! 😆😅
Always waiting for the songs in the end
You forgot to say that the chicken breast has to be T H I C C and J U I C Y
I'm new to YSAC, and the only thing I don't like about his videos is the way how he says Pepper pepper pepper. Like for real, how fucking cheesy do you have to be in order to say pepper 3 times? Why not only 1 time? What's wrong with you?
So does he live in Canada or vermont
XD Imma stare into your ears while watering my plants with chicken XD I somehow got Salmonella by laughing, peace be with me. I am now going to join the chicken, I also give my laptop to cousin Tom, BAI!

I'm glad I found this channel
This is the first video I watched from him and OMG FREAKING HILARIOUS 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I like this, but I miss the alternative punk nerds Weezer used to be :/ What happend?
is that supposed to be murray at 3:36 ?
I get the feeling they should do a track with Beck.
Not too sure if this song will ever grow on me......
This band has so lost it.
Here before it gets viral
I definitely see what Fantano is talking about. It's not a bad sound. But not the sound I look for in a Weezer track. A bit too polished and clean.
Great collage/design work. I love the west coast/beach/sunny-fun iconography.
Weezer sound like they've been listening to Hard-Fi
All I can think of is the Surfer God episode of China, IL
0:53 Lyrics in the description are wrong, my god, so unprofessional.
Much better than the last two singles in my opinion!
not a good song.. idk why singers i like say they like weezer
This doesn't even sound like The Beach Boys! :(
Last few songs have been okay but after the White Album my expectations were really high!! So far I'm slightly disappointed...
let me just say this for everyone SHUT UP AND ENJOY THE SONG!
Makes a rainy day shine.
LOVE THE NEW SONG, I WANT THE ALBUM NOW!
It's growing on me...
This is an insult to Weezer and The Beach Boys
They should leave the beach music to the Beach Boys
Walking with the Mexicans \nShould I call an ambulance\n\nReally, Rivers? \n\n\n\n\nBecause I would would have called ICE
jesus christ the lyrics.
This song has no soul
N o T h a n k Y o u . . . . .
Beach Boys = Pacific Nightmare.   Turn it down.....
Oh!  First single since they started that I haven't instantly liked. Hopefully grow on me\n.
I feel like I'm in an abusive relationship with Weezer. They made me fall in love with them for 7 years then they started beating me. They'd apologize and buy me flowers and I'd believe them...until the next album when they pushed me down the stairs. And I'd keep coming home to them. And they would apologize, and I'd take them back. This time though, I'm finally packing and leaving. It's been a long 24 years, but all good things come to an end.
This is fully awful and it's all the more painful off the back of how amazing White Album was.
My first ever hit of The Beach Boys. Combined with a werewolf. What's not to love?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeVEbbheUck
I was hoping it would sound like the Beach Boys - like Surf Wax America sort of did....
ugh...make believe had like three good songs on it...after that--it's just sad. sorry.
RIP the time you could say new Weezer is as good as their old stuff 2014-2016
This is the same band that made Everything Will Be Alright in the end 3 years ago? \nDisappointed...
Its a bit like raditude
How do you go from white to this in 1 year?\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to disagree
Rivers does it again.
I wasn't even born when The Blue Album and Pinkerton came out, but I'm still hoping for another Pinkerton. That is the greatest album to one of my favorite bands that I've ever listened to. I can relate to each song perfectly. These new songs are too much like every other song playing nowadays, no real instruments or deep lyrics. Just random noises and lyrics put together into random places. I want the Weezer with the guitar solos and Rivers' personal lyrics. It's a lot more relatable than the music they're making now. I'll always support them, but I wish they'd go back to the good music.
it's not terrible
Well, I like it. Turn it up, it's weezer!
My eyes get moist with your tribute song!!!
how you gonna make a song called beach boys without sick harmonies
it's alright. i guess.
I don't understand the comments praising this song. I love Weezer to death but as soon I clicked the play button I felt my life force being drained by how utterly boring and predictable this song is. Not to mention some of these lyrics, christ.
I like the Beach Boys sounding part in the second part of the chorus.
Well that was awful.
So after two decent rock records were back at Ratitude. DAMN YOU Weezer.
ughhh. Foo fighters and Mastodon release awesome albums and Weezer release this. Forget this and go listen to Mastodons new EP; its epic.
This song is awful! What happened?
Everytime I think Weezer can't come up with a more cringeworthy chorus than Beverly Hills, they release a new song and I realize it's been going downward for more than a decade now. I mean, seriously? Turn it up, it's the Beach Boys? Jesus Christ. So bad. Well, there will always be Blue, Pinkerton, and Green for me.\n\nP.S.: Yes, White had some good moments. That's it though.
I can't believe ... Why they released a song in 2014 saying I forgot that disco sucks ??? It is all lie... Unfortunatelly, I have concluded that =w= is a fake band... they made blue and pinkerton because grunge at that time was yet strong... if disco was strong  at that time, there would not be blue nor pinkenton, but raditude and things like that... sad to say that, but it is true...
Rivers is trolling us all again
It's different, I like it
Would like old Weezer sound to come back tbh
TURN IT UP, IT'S THE BEACH BOOOYS\n\nMost obnoxious chorus Weezer has made in a while.
This is chill... I love it
While this isn't the greatest song Weezer has ever released, there is no denying this is catchy af.
Man. He's really figured out how to make efficient and catchy songs.
The verses have nothing to do with The Beach Boys.
Verse makes up for the chorus, honestly not a bad song, just give it a second listen.
The chorus, to me, is an nice and interesting little tribute. And did any of you catch a couple small Murry Wilson interludes (obviously reenacted)? I did and noticed them right away at first listen. (Murry was the father of the Beach Boys' Brian, Carl, and Dennis Wilson.)
The chorus is like an anti-commercial. If The Beach Boys weren't already one of my favorite bands ever, I would've been turned off from them forever.\n\nBut regardless, the verses and bridge are nice, and I'll still be crankin' dem Beach Boys at the end of the day.
it's a hip hop world\n\njust kill me
This isn't bad, it's just bland, it's so mediocre, it's plain old pop. If I wasn't told it was Weezer I wouldn't know it was them. I'm not asking for another Pinkerton, so tired of people saying that, but even Maladroit and stuff from Red blows this away. I'll take Miss Sweeney or Burndt Jamb over this any day.
Wood wee I dress just like The Beach Boys
As a single, yeah, this is weak. Moist makes me uncomfortable. But this is the same band that at one point put out Pinkerton. So like, maybe the uncomfort is intentional?
I love Weezer, I love summer, but why do they only make music for this season??
This is just really disappointing, their last 3 singles have all been bad!
Good. Not as good as Feels Like Summer which is excellent but much better than Mexican Fender which is a bit throwaway. New album will probably be OK but I loved White so will probably feel a little let down. We'll see I guess!
THIS IS FANTASTIC!!!  What an excellent chorus - a real cool ode to Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys!!!  Sweet tune!  Thanks Weezer!!
I get some rhcp vibes with the guitar.
1st listen - no likey!\n2nd listen - LOVE\n\n#thatsweezer
I cant wait for the official acoustic version of this
woah. I'm the 100 thousandth viewer. neet.
WOW!
Sounds like India.
GETCHOO GETCHOO GETCHOO GETCHOO GETCHOO GETCHOO GETCHOO GETCHOO GETCHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOO\nUHUHUHHHHHH GETCHOOOOOOOO\n\nlove the lyrics
This album is gonna suck.
=w=
ugh
love it!

Weezer brought me here

Much.  Better
weezer はスゴイですね。

HOLY HECK YES
Mexican fender was alright, but this.. Idk.
Genius!
Radi2de?
Love love love it!
Una de mis bandas favorita haciendo una cancion sobre otra de mis bandas favoritas, son lo mejor!! los amooooo, y a los beach boys tambien <3<3

Why is weezer bad now?
Not once have i ever heard a Weezer song one time, I refuse to ever listen to this garbage again, fucking awful,
It grows on you, but the lyrics are still weird. Makin' my eyes get moist.
Weezer just might be the worst band ever.
If Weezer is looking to gain new, younger fans, this is not how to do it. I'm a fairly new fan of Weezer, I jumped on the train with the white album, and have since gone through their discography. Their first two releases and the white album are all stellar to me. Why, WHY are they so insistent on pandering to a radio-audience?
You can grab a piece and go The fact that you guys think I wont eat the entire thing in one go is adorable. Misguided, but adorable.
Berry bark.\nWoof.\n\nI am DEAD, you guys are so awesome.
*Does SortedFood consciously have Barry in your berry-related videos?*
Who cares about the food. I'm wondering where Barry's jacket is from
em-BARRY-sing
Lower in fat; lower in sugar; delicious. You're contradicting yourself when you say that.
a little bit of honey ... 😂😂
3:46 *woah*
Not sure if they have them in Britain, but my favorite ice lolly is the orange creamsicle.
Do you have to use Greek Yogurt? Could you get the same effect from just using regular yogurt?
i like loli too
It's soo pretty and Pink
Cannot wait to try this!!
where's the sprig of mint
My God, Barry has become very handsome. He is down right dreamy.
lavender, drop a sprig or two of mint in when blending, then drizzle the top with melted chocolate  before freezing?  or even some green tea macha...hmm
You guys should use lavender in more recipes, it's honestly one of my favorite flavors.
This is very similar to my mamma's home made ice cream. She only uses three ingredients. Greek yogurt. Fruit (usually raspberries since I'm allergic to strawberries) and caster sugar. That's it, than she shoves in her ice-cream maker for several hours to let it thicken. We keep the seeds from the raspberries in as we think it makes it taste more interesting. I think I'll add honey next time to see the results.
We don't get Greek Yogurt where I live. Can I use normal yogurt?
What did he call the cranberries
Does any yoghurt work? Or only greek yoghurt?
I just want to say, I started watching your videos because theyre fun to watch but I dont rlly cook\nBut recently I had a cooking class (weird for a science major, i know, but seeing how geeky Ben is it prob makes sense) and your videos help a lot so thanks
I love these Kenwood made better videos! Sponsoring made right! :) I'm always in search for something healthy but indulgent and rich that can fool me and satisfy my cheat needs, so this videos are perfect ahah
Looks delicious but bad for people with sensitive teeth
This looks like a winner!
Yay, I got featured in a video ^_^
Now I know how else I can use my frozen berries I bought sometime back. THANK YOU
Why Greek yogurt? I hate Greek yogurt. It tastes of cream cheese. Would a different yogurt work for this?
given that your carbonara took me 45 minutes to make, this seems right up my alley. :)
Hi I'm a long time lover of your channel and I'm going off to uni on Sunday, it would be kinda cool if you did some budget friendly, student friendly dishes
How long can these last in the freezer? Thanks!
Wow I think I wanna give this a go!
Bung some bacon in it.
u could make a nutella frozen bark.. just  blend nutella yogurt and frozen banana with a bit of vanilla...!! perfect for a chocoholic ♥__♥
Great timing - now summer is over! ;)
Would this use with a coconut or soy yoghurt instead? :)
Oo you could do coconut yoghurt, with mango pieces and lime zest 👌🏼
I really wanted to try this recipe but I am allergic to lavender. Is there an alternative
Lore in fat lore In shuga 🤔
Look awesome guys!!! But I wonder if we can do it with lime and mint? I love the sour taste and if it won't work just add some rum and booomm we just created a freaking mojito ice cream!!! :))
Ok but Barry looks like a Matalan model. I'm not complaining!
so simple, but looks so good!  would goat's milk yogurt work instead of regular (cow)??
literally about to go make this right now
LAVENDER? Who are you and what did you do with Ben's mint?
in love with Barry's hair😍
I don't know if I keep missing the videos or have they stopped announcing what the next week's theme is? I haven't seen the mystery box in a while and you guys haven't been directing us to the website for a sneak peak on next week's theme as far as I know? Are they announcing all of their stuff on other social media now?\nI'm so confused >.<\n\nAlso I know this is an ad and is likely unrelated to what you guys are doing this week.
man this looks sooo good 😭 once i get discharged from the hospital, i am so making this!!
Ben can't replace mint with lavender. What has the world come to?
it's so fast it's almost emBERRYssing
Berry's poor heart shattered faster then the bark did as Ben destroyed it😂
So I've made this before and my problem with it is that it's too cold to bite into, but when it is warm enough to bite into it makes a huge mess all over your fingers. Does anyone else have this problem and any solutions?
Can you use any replacements for the lavender?
After seeing the headline, I was sure you were going to finish the video by stuffing frozen yogurt and tree bark down Barry's pants. And I'm kind of disappointed it didn't happen.
How can I get rid of the ice crystals? I had problems finding a large tray so it became a bit thicker than I wanted it to be... Will it have a smoother texture if I make it thinner or is there any trick for it?
Em(berry)sing to call a recipe
looks so good this guys, whats the texture like?
Calm down Ben! Just coz it's easy doesn't mean it's embarrassing as a recipe.  You're embarrassing. As a snob. 😑
My father has been making this homemade ice cream for years and years. It's the easiest thing ever and it's so good, only ever eaten it as soft serve
Forgot to call it an #ad.
Soooo....can I do it with cheese and bacon?
What is a lollie?  I'm from Canada 🇨🇦. \n\nThis looks awesome! Way to go! Also love the humour.
Ben, you are the star of this show...you could have your own channel.
any video that involves berries *has* to have Barry in it. this is a rule
Where can you get a packet of Lavender in herb form?
I have the same blender...can recommend if anyone is intersted.
I am sad cz i can't have these 😯
Here's a recipe that I've always been curious to try but never have cuz I never found a recipe: *Lavender Ice Cream*\nI saw the ice cream in the movie It's Complicated and I've always wondered how you put lavender in ice cream.\nMight I request this recipe from you guys at SORTED Food?
This is a quick to make, quick to eat recipe. You literally have to eat it quick, otherwise you get froyo fingers 😃 I would try it though, if it wasn't 16 degrees outside... 🤒
I knew barry's actual bark was coming but i still laughed really hard
Very up-town.  Can also be done with bananas and chocolate if berries aren't your thing and chocolate is..
nice! will make that
The two best things in life have come together.\n\nI've always love white chocolate bark, and frozen yoghurt. THE DREAMS ARE ALIVE.
I'm so jealous of Barry's eyebrows
i was wondering if you could make this with pumpkin and ginger snaps for a autumn style?
This is doing to be a healthy snack😍
Definitely going to try this one! Not sure about grab and go, maybe grab shove in my face before it melts all over my hand
What about adding some mint to the mix, just to give it that kick? Mint and berries are great together! (Plus, it would make Ben happy😂)
You didn't listen did you. 😂😂😂😂
Twisters
YUM!
I will skip lavender.
Please some more healthy frozen foods pls
Ohhhh sassy Ben You didn't listen, did you?
Ok this, but mint choc chip orrrrrrrr, who knows, endless choices.
Nom
Ice lollys is a dumb name for a popsicle.  Lollipop + Icicle is better than Ice + Lollipop.  Wait.  Hmmmmm....
Cherry brandy was my fav
FAB ICE LOLLIES!!!!!!!
Ben marry me 😘
It looks so yummy 😋
Zaps were the best!!
hi
I don't like yogurt. Could you do this with ice cream?
😍 I wish I weren't on a diet
looks shit
I can't even stand the smell of lavander, i will never understand why people eat it !
Mini Milks for the Win!! I loved them as a kid too! The vanilla or chocolate were the best \n\n(That's the milk lolly Ben is talking about at the beginning)
Seems delicious, but with the cold and (kind of) stormy weather I would much rather have something warm or comforting. Any chance you guys will make some autumny recipes?
Looks lovely and will be making it with my grandchildren but does it not melt fast?
Can anyone explain to me what lavender would taste like? Besides lavender of course... Whenever I hear of adding a flavor like rose or lavender I get this vision of eating soap or perfume.
HA! This was great. I wish we had Panda Express! 😭 Too bad spending $2 on half an avocado seems reasonable when you've been living in Korea and Japan for a long time!
I always ask for 2 fortune cookies, but they're always so stingy at Panda Express... and I only end up with 1.
Can we please talk about the Nat Tran cameo in the documentary about salmon 😂
this is the best video ever\nfavorite quote Huh
Hey man, YOU OR YOUR TEAM HAS RAW TALENT!!! SO FUNNY😅😅😅 VERY CREATIVE AND DETAILED. GOD BLESS YOU EVERYBODY👆🌈 i enjoyed very much and your work is very good lol THANK YOU. GOD BLESS.
I wish there a panda express in my area.
I feel bad for guys too but I'm exactly that type of girl who will never be satisfied wherever she eats XD
Avocados don't actually contain omega 3's.
Hmm ... Would this be funny if the gender was swapped?
that was really good acting and very funny too do you have more funny videos ?
Ya know, I was going to ditch about a third of the way through but it just started getting so ridiculous I had to see it all the way through.  And I wasn't disappointed - actually LOL'd.
Wish Panda near me delivered ;0
cheghadr kiri
omg -_- this is so true.
ahahahahhah! I love you're funny short movies! :D
Hamburgers are called hamburgers because they are from Hamburg Germany... which came originally from Mongolia.
Wait, that voice... It's Emma! I love you, Joanna Sotomura 😍
We all know Ryan directed this
what was this below-average comedy
It's called decision fatigue! Happens always after work at dinner time.
Have I just seen a kind of Sherlock? 😂
It's basic economics 😭😭😭😭😭😭 meeeeeeeeeeee.  And hahaha you know how bad my memory is
Videos like this make me SO glad to be single.\n\n#MGTOW
Lol I'd love to process places to eat using this method with a friend lmao
WHAT IS PHIL SAYING AT 0:15 YA'LL \n\njk edit: after like probably 6 repeats, good work today steve I struggled tho 😂😭😅
Hahaha I was so happy to see Chris but he was so mistreated in this video poor Chris! Love Phil making it so complicated as well.
Pro life tip - whenever you get asked this dumb question, you go to the worst place imaginable. Just pick something she hates and go there and order something she hates to eat\n\nEventually she won't ask this dumb question
When in doubt, choose pizza.
Because this phenomena of getting to choose what to eat is recent. In the past, people ate what they had and acquired what they could, not what they wanted.
This guy could have caught Kira.\nBoth of them.
Is it just me or is this shit boring
4:06 -  You know how bad my memory is \n\nYeaaaah.. Sure haha..
this is effective advertisement right here. My boyfriend and I went to Panda Express immediately after watching this XD
I am just going to get McDonald's
Ugh. I just ate. I can't think about eating more food but I HAVE been craving Panda lately.... Hmm. Maybe just a teensy weensy bit tomorrow.
I feel so bad for Steve er.. Chris lol
I was laughing even before I started watching this video.
L and N have some competition. Light Yagami, watch out.
This video was really dumb. I didn't stop watching it to see if there was a pun at the end but then it just ended. YouTubes been recommending the wrong videos
surprise!!! This is a food kitchen, where all the homeless go, shut up eat your soup!!!
ummm.. could you guys please not compare Wong Fu's video to Ryan's video. It did look similar just because of his way of speaking and explaining while standing, but they put their own hard work into it. They had their own idea. Let's just not put them in an awkward position to reconsider their own ideas by comparing them countless times with Ryan.
This video just proved us that women are so complicated that transformed us men to complicated thing ...
Cool  a lot of fun.  Like. 👍
You know I have a bad memory
seems like you are spending too much time with Ryan
*he went full Asian* 😂
What the heck's wrong with this guy...trying to be so sweet but not...ah oh!! He just let her girl starve to death guessing..harhar.!Don't ever do that to me dearie! Isn't that clear enough with YOU?
Wong Fu never fails to make me smile and after watching all their videos I be like OMG thats so relatable. Been a fan since long and there hasn't been anything since then which failed to amaze me when it comes to Wong Fu.
So Cathy got married now it's Joannaaaaa
Its so long long time since i see your vid. YOu change alot. LOL Great Job!
I love you Chris!!!! I'll eat with you any day!
The part where Phil says What's BLACK, WHITE, and SOFT? And then it pans to Panda....haha that really got me laughing!
I work at panda express xD
The tyranny of choice. Some people want to maximise every experience unknowingly adding more dissatisfaction to the process. Just name 3 choices and pick the best one and be satisfied with it.
Yeah but im handsome and........ NOT NOW STEVE
I love original content :D
Chris Dinh !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He is such a gentleman. He is a less awkward Ted. More Skits with Chris !!!!!!! please :)

I see Benedict Cumberbatch. I watch. He's just so irresistible (I'm not gay).
omg..! after The Current War and then The Child in Time trailer.. i'm ready for this.. can't wait! XD
Dear BBC could you reveal the air date asap thanks! Can't wait to watch it
Yeees Benedict! Whatever he does, its just the best! <3 Cant wait to watch this. Its going to be beautiful and emotional just like his movie Third Star. It made me cry alot.
I'm gonna cry a lot.
I guess this will have to make up for the Sherlock withdrawals.
benedryl cucumberpatch is BBC's ultimate clickbait.
Υesss, Benedict!
Sees Ben Cumberbatch, yep I'm totally watching this.
sooooohot...just sayin.
Press x to scream KATE!!!!
The Child In Time airs on Sunday September 24 at 9pm on BBC One.
Can time heal?\nNo but Doctor strange can.
He needs to be used for another Sherlock series never mind this
Heavy Rain by BBC One
2 Best things in it.\n1) BENEDICT\n2) MUSIC
Lost a daughter? Don't wonder around! Go to Bake street!!!
Sherlock has a child 😉👍🏻
This is the one case Sherlock can't solve
I love you,benny
I Wonder, do you think that Kate is a Time Lady? I'm just curious.
This looks good
All series dealing with marriages are a real rip-off.
Looks so good
this is healing my Sherlock withdrawal! <3
Looks good!!🙊 I love benedict❤
Don't worry this is Sherlock Holmes he will find her this finna be be a breeze.
Christ that looks depressing just what we all need. Why can't they do a drama about losing a fiver, or drinking an unexpectedly cold cup of tea, or perhaps a smoking tiger with anger issues and a love for left socks. Off to GPs for some anti depressants tomorrow, thanks.
The role looks perfect for Benedit Cumberbatch and I already can't wait for it! Its going to be something without a doubt!
(tempted to draft new love letter right here and now) My Darling Benedict--It has been so long!...etc. etc.
I can`t wait. Ah, my love Benedict!
A couple of days ago a couple of dudes drove up to a High School near Rubery in Birmingham, trying to lure a child around 12 to get in their car because they knew her mom. \nI really wish a channel would commission To Catch A Predictor UK. It'd be so popular, plus it'd strike fear into the nonces, knowing they could be exposed to the nation on TV. Please, please, please, please
Shame he doesn't have the TIME STONE
Ben you made this year awesome!\nCan't wait
Book of the week, A bad storm by Theresa Down....................
No Benedict, you are SHERLOCK, you can Find her.

HE WOULD BE SUCH A GOOD DAD IM SO OVERJOYED

Anyone with just an ounce of empathy cannot but be gripped by the power of Cumberbatch in this trailer. My heart and stomach are tight from it.

No effects but it looks like it has not done any editing
Jesus 10 years after I had to read this shite in AS English they're making a show of it.  Worst crap I've ever read, and I've read Dan Brown.
Benedict Cumberbatch\n\n\n\n\nWho?
Aman benedict sen 5. Sezon çekme de current war ve bunu çek :( üzdü neyse bizde bunlarla idare edecez.Bunu ingilizce yazamıyorum ya yetmedi ingilizcem inş Türk çıkar
Why not make another season of Sherlock if you had time for this :////
Shit
What is the point of making a video game movie, and it looking like a video game.
old tomb raider actress forgot her fans we get this unknown
Did Angelina say no?  I was just thinking if they could remake this and said no....but maybe a 3rd is podsible. Man was I wrong
I don't like her face. It looks more manlier than laura. And there's no triangle boobs. Disliked.
Needs more:\n\n\n\n-Action angles\n-Bloody injuries\n-Animal harvesting\n-Cannibalistic cults\n-Wound on her right arm from an arrow\n-Less puzzles\n-Boobs\n-Shorter shorts\n-Bigger ass\n-More revealing stranded sequence\n-Feminism triggers\n-And without a doubt, camp fires.
Hey it's the people from into the badlands
Fucking stupid just like the Jolie version and the stupid game! There definitely running out of ideas for movies that's why they keep remaking old movies thinking they can make them better! What a fucking joke! Lol!
I just saw the whole movie in this trailer ;-)
Girl can fucking jump her ass off
How the fuck do ppl praise IT, an embarrassing jump scare CGI movie for morons and basic bitches/bros. yet dislike a trailer for this film even though it looks exactly like the new critically acclaimed games just in live action? \n\nIt looks fine, yet it gets a worse like ratio than some of the worst movies in Hollywood?
Thousands of girls want to be Lara Croft, many of them talented actresses, then the guy goes to put a little girl .......... in the role of Lara, can only be the daughter of some famous,,,cinema is going through a lack of actors for roles in films very large even
i don't know..when i see her play this role i think it's like to whatch a teen drama movie but with more explosions
I think she has a baby face and she's really beautiful but overall I think she will do a good performance. Yes we can compare the video game to the movie and people can keep hating for whatever reason but this might be very enjoyable and I think she would do a good job
This movies gonna suck no matter what.\nAlso 1:53 is one of the funniest things I've ever experienced
How far off from the game will this one be eh?
u know people said the same shit when they saw who was gon play spider man in civil war. fast forward today. yall just gon think how stupid u was. true story
Dear God this looks bad. And sorry, but Alicia Vikander is no Angelina Jolie. They have literally cobbled together scenes from the 2 Jolie movies and tried to re-invent the wheel. And what happened to Lara Croft's boobs and bodacious body? I say this as a woman - who's not a lesbian! That was part of the charm of the original movies. That a woman that gorgeous could be so badass. Now Lara Croft looks like a 14 year-old girl. I will give Vikander this though - her British accent is equally as bad as Jolie's was. Otherwise - I'll pass. She's not believable as an action hero and I really can't get over the fact that she looks like a teenager girl and the characters supposed to be 21 and she's 27 in real life. When is Hollywood going to learn - stop remaking everything!
Please, do nota de a shitty movie, be at least a good one
looks nice. just dont like the sfx when far away from the planescene in the ending. it looks too obviously greenscreened? just me? no? :x
Don't give 2 shits for what the critics say, I'm watching this
Ill subscribe to anyone that subs to me with two accounts mine and my wife's thank you.
Alicia looks awesome. But i'm not supporting this movie. It's the same agenda as Ghostbusters.
It's gonna be shit and you all know it
Wait, are you sure this isn't the trailer for the original with Angelina Jolie? Because this still has the visuals of a B movie from 2001...
I'm surprised they didn't make Laura a gender fluid white person who sometimes apologizes to the bad guys to alleviate her white guilt.
I can only imagine how much of this will be focused on her being a woman and not her just being Lara Croft. hollywood is going to fill this shit with so much SJW narrative.
So this is based on one of the games then right?
WHERE ARE THE BOOBS?
https://youtu.be/MXxYbbtvBwk\n\nu all like this video
Why not cast that badass chick from As Above So Below?
Why they didn't cast Camilla Ludington is beyond me
This movie trailer is so bad that it crashed my youtube app.
Why isn't she black This movie is racist 0/10
Love that everyone is calling this poorly-written and saying Alicia is miscast when they haven't even seen the movie yet. History shows us that video game adaptations are not good, so this could end up being no different, but how about waiting to dog pile on the movie until you actually see the damn thing?
No one can replace Angelina
Hey, a real plot!
Angelina jolie as a cameo would be nice lol
Like every game based movie, it's probably going to suck
Not enough Accent to my liking. She must have been born in American this Lara Croft. lol
Naissu. She's hot to me 😍
Is their a chance?
The cast is horrible, same as Terminator Genisys.
Looks good i guess... too bad they couldn't bring the one that did the voice acting for the reboot and ROTTR.
I big fan of lara croft ,waiting for that movie.
0:22 Wait, hold on. I've seen that before. You probably shouldn't... well then, enjoy having your soul torn apart.
The recent new Tomb Raider games Lara is more believeable as a character than this, looks like.
I was hoping Daisy Ridley would be Lara but she's really hot so I'm down hahah
This might possibly be the movie that will break the game-becomes-movie curse.
I was really hoping this would be good, but it looks like another crap video-game adaptation
F..k another remake - just do something new!
Wow, it actually looks pretty good. You have my interest.
*This time they remembered to put the sound effects on the trailer*
yeahhhhh......she is hot and super
Uwe Boll is the Director?
Can we get an Uncharted movie?
Who saw this on 'The Late Late Show' last night?
Make an Uncharted movie already with Ryan Reynolds
o my god ! like ! :D
horrible trailer. Why do they reveal the entire plot in 45 seconds? Also why reveal the character in first 5 seconds? Ruins any interest...this is probably gonna suck anyway.
I've played the exact game they're re-making too. \n\n\n\n\nThere was a Tomb Raider movie in 2003 too btw
Wow, what a  well-progressed world we live in, people are whining because they dont approve the boobs-size of the leading lady ! Woah !
I hope she does for videogame fans what Gal did with WW for the DCEU. And everyone will shut the hell up.

Meh.

Son of batman'nin ne zaman filmi çıkacak
*I’m still alive, if anyone cares...*
Looks like you pulled a Jonah .
My dick gets swallowed all the time
Next vid what if you lost all yr teeth pls pls pls pls
Did some one called Arnold upset you in another life.
Stop arnold abuse lol\nLike if you agree
Yes! U hit the trending PAGE,! Nice job riddle!,
I love u Arnold <3
Just a question, why does his finger always fall off?
I'd probably get projectile vomited to Nineveh
Someone should confirm it with a guy who got swallowed by a whale and lived to tell his tale.
Did you leave the timecode on the vid on purpose? Welp... too late now. :P
What do they use to animate it
Any one remeber me from the alien video
next do what happens if your mom swallows you alive
Wtf is going on this didn't answer my question
Something is wrong...\nI haven't seen any overwhaleming joke 🤔
You'd be able to bs the story so much that u can trick millions of dumb people that someone could actually live in a whale just because a book said so
I don’t think I would of been able to continue in life with out this info 🙏🏻
Hey Arnold, what do you use to animate?
Ill subscribe to anyone that subs to me with two accounts mine and my wife's thank you.
It’s the end of COCKtober 😫🎃🍆 but that means the beginning of 💦💦💦 HOEvember!! 💦💦👅 get ready 😱 for SPANKS-GIVING 👋😏🍑 send this to 1️⃣4️⃣ hoes who need to be spanked 🙌🏼 by daddy 💘👦🏽🗣 if you get this message 📧💌 you will get a special 😲 spanking 👏 from SUGAR DADDY 🤑💰💶 forward this to 1️⃣4️⃣ fuckgirls 💁💋👛 to get some 🍑👈 in-the-BUTT-ACTION 💨 If you don’t, 😖 be prepared 😰 for 6️⃣9️⃣ days without the D ❌🚫🆘
Why do you write english so bad?
No one knows the subliminal way these Faggots take shots at the book of Jonah
I just love the concept of this channel. 😍
This channel is growing! This video is even #1 trending. The best part of these videos is that Arnold is still alive. :D
I see spongebob went inside Pearl when Mr. Krabs wasn't present
I'm watching this video in a whale stomach
Can Arnold survive a trusnami/earthqauke
This CHANNEL gonna rock this world. \nLike if you agree.!👍🏻👍🏻
Man i wish i found this channel sooner. amazing videos
All because he wanted to see his cousin in Switzerland
The Bible is a lie. No man can survive 3 days in a large fish. Blue whales throats are to small to swallow a man whole. There are no whales in the Mediterranean Sea where the story took place. Even if he survived getting swallowed by a sperm whale he would die from lack of oxygen, methane gas, and stomach acid. Plus why would a god go through such a nonsense and fake sounding plan to get his message across he could of done it so many other ways and leave evidence that isn't a corrupt, crappy, immoral book. Find another way to live your life maybe think for yourself. God, Jesus, and hell aren't real.
FINALLY MY QUESTION HAS BEEN ANSWERED!!! No really i always wanted to know what would happen if i got swallowed by a whale.
Put your finger up if you liked this video
Man this channel grew fast
Sorry the smoke your smelling is just liteing up a spliff😧
What happens if Arnold ate 1000 lbs of food?
Omg 😂 all these references inside the whale
Arnold - What did I do to deserve this\n\nNarrator - You know what you did
Please send him to stomach of snake😁🙋✌👍
I thought it said what if the world swallowed you alive
A sperm whale does not have teeth in it's upper jaw.
A subject for GROWN UPS trending number One. Refreshing!!!
if the audio was better, I would sub
Jonah's full of shit. Oh sorry wasn't a whale big fish lol
Am i the only one who is trying to think that how did arnold smell smoke underwater or how did he smell anything? XD
Isn't there land IN THE BACKGROUND
Meet Arnold LOV YA!!! KEEP SAFE DUDE I CARE SO MUCH ABOUT YOU :(
never let him sleep for a week.
What happens with his finger in every video?! xD
Well actually it was a fish, but eh
How does it feel to be #1 in trending
Need a commercial break? Check out CommercialTime now!
Arnold loses a finger every video
Hey Arnold! Wait you're not the Arnold I know.
I already know of a man who was swallowed by a whale and survived. His name was Jonah.
Wait... You sound like the same guy from riddle. Is it me or am I just going crazy?
So what your saying is jonah could  have survived in the whale ?
This channel went from 10K to 500K in the blink of an eye!

FUUUUUUCKKKKKK YEEEEAAAAA!!! \n\nJon Bernthal = THE BEST PUNISHER OF ALL TIME!!!! NO ONE WILL EVER BE AS GOOD AS HIM!.
I watched Daredevil just to see the Punisher, awesome trailer btw.
Great work on trailer and show but the actor to play punisher idk!??
Well looks like Shane came back for his vengence to take Carl and kill Rick.
Is that Oscar from The Office?????
I feel like this would be a great series for new comers to netflix but it really doesn't seem to be marvel but then again baised in what time the series takes place it might be marvel
I'm gonna watch the shit out of this in such an aggresive fashion.
O boy the hype is REAL
So there ain't no date or
Most anticipated Netflix show for me!
So... This is the John Wick from Marvel.
Bra this shot looks like a watchdogs TV series.
One was probably the most fitting choice for this.
Didn't really like that spoiler of the wife but still a cool trailer
The fans wanted more... so Netflix gave them more..
It's so good to see a hero just kill the bad guys for once.
Hell of a trailer it is !!!! Been waiting for this for a long time ! Nailed it !
All episode available on 10 Nov 2017???
it's a frank, frank. A frank who shoots franks.
1000 dislikes from liberal loons who want the punisher to hand out flowers to the bad guys
is Disney going to take this to their streaming channel?
One of these best trailers I've ever seen in my life.
Marvel doin' what Marvel does best. Let's go!!!!
I can't wait to see it. I love this guy. He's an AWESOME actor.   Can't wait!!!!!!!!!
Meh.   Tom Jane's version Dirty Laundry(which he funded) is way better. Thats how Punisher should be.
Bullets in sync with the song is gold. Up vote.
Amazing song choice. Helped to give the trailer the Punisher vibe.
*All we need is a John wick cameo and my life is complete*
Well it was either Metallica or Slayer (ex: Angel of Death)
Had to watch the trailer 3 times, kept missing important scenes because I was trying to hear what part of One is played each time, how they synced the gunfire with Lars's double bass etc etc. Purely awesome.
I think i got 10-??-2017 on date
Maybe this can make me forget that Iron Fist ever happened.
It's like John Wick, but tv serie.
Easily one of the best trailers I have ever seen
No wonder Shane(Frank) wanted Rick's family so bad
Seriously best fucking trailer I've seen in a while. 🤘🏽
I only came here because I heard that Metallica is in this trailer, I was not disappointed.
Bad ass the kill count should be massive
Cmooon, still no release date? This looks awesome, tell us when we can get it!
This looks so good!!!!! But just tell us when the release date is already! At this point I have to assume it's gonna come out on December 31st, 2017. Unless you are gonna surprise us all and release it this Friday and crash the internet.
Awesome trailer one of my all time favorite anti-heroes right next to Deadpool.
wow, he made that shirt with just a spray paint can?
Hell yes. The Marvel series we've been waiting for. I hope it does well so Marvel can finally start to make gritty super hero films.
This should be the show's theme music.
sooooo.finally a good,reaaaaally good marvel/netflix show besides daredevil!!!!!im waiting for something like this since DD season 2!!! jessica jones,luke cake,iron fist and even the defenders are okay....but just that,,,,just ok!!! this is a trailer that rise expectations until the release!!
You can just tell this is gonna be the fucking best of the Marvel Universe! IMO.
I've Been Salivating about This Show  Coming To Netflix for So Long...Now I Just Need A Release Date,So I Can Plain My Binge Weekend...
U know shits about get real when you heard One intro
I Fucking Love it!!!!!!💯💯💯
I know it is just going to be used just for the trailer but I would love 'One' to be the opening credits song.
Awesome!!! Having one in the trailer makes it so much more sweet
Now im gonna feel even more sorry for him
Screwatack better make a death battle on john wick and punisher. DEATHBATTLE
Also Shane was the Punisher... Somehow that makes sence.
wow that sucked... the only good thing about this trailer is metallica
It’s about time netflix make an r rated superhero show. Those others are losing fans every season
No wonder other marvel shows get canceled..this is all we need
i got excited but then realized it was on netflix so clearly its going to be shit
The Electric Guitar tune in sync with the guns was an amazing idea!! 😁\nMetallica brownie points!
Shane.FrankCastle.MetallicaOne.SkullShirt.ThePunisher.HellYeah.
The most badass marvel trailer ever
They casted the perfect punisher IMO
SICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
METAL AS FUCK
Can't wait till Q..?! 2017

When the fuck is the release date?
Says November 14th, 2017 on IMDB
even the gun shots at 0:44 are similar to one's drum beats during the final instrumental part.

The fish and chip shop is still there!!! I went to it before seeing you in the show - you and everyone were absolutely brilliant! Also, if you can you should totally go to the cat cafe it's amazing
Make sure you take a photo in costume in that same doorway near dressing room 22!
Your purple backpack is absolutely gorgeous
how would I get my letter to you? :)
I saw you perform last night in bristol (20th) and im seeing you again tonight!!! Couldnt be more excited if i tried Xx
So sad that when I lived in Bristol, the Addams family was on in Cardiff and now I've moved there for uni its in Bristol this week :(
I lived in Bristol for 3 years when I was at uni. I loved it there. It's so quirky and like a mini London.
Wow Carrie, your hair is growing so fast!
I love that you give your coworkers free reign of the camera sometimes! It's super funny, and also fun to see you in action!
any small youtubers wanting to help each other out? ill sub back x
OH MY GOD YOU ARE IN MY HOME CITY! I'm coming to see the show on Friday and I cant wait!
Carrie your backpack is lovely!! so pretty!! xx
You opening that card.... Oh, Carrie!! We miss you!! Xxx
My mum and I went to see the matinee in Bristol yesterday! It was the first musical I'd ever been to and we thought you were all amazing :) Such a fun show!
Poor Archie. :(. So is les Dennis still ill, he wasn't well when I saw you last week in Manchester. Also I think there must have been something going around that theatre, I got ill last week too. X
Aw the card from your mom and dad<3 Dressing room nostalgia :') RIP Archie!
I noticed before you mentioned the Cat Cafe that you were going to walk passed it and you gave the exact reaction I thought you would lol, love cat cafes.
Carrie, would you ever be able to do an updated hair care routine? Your hair is looking so long and lovely
I like Oliver's haircut. If I wasn't going bald, I'd get it myself.
I'm coming to see the show on Saturday evening, so excited!
Omg I LOVE your bag! Where is it from!? X
It was great seeing the show yesterday!
Do you think you're gonna venture into the cat café at some point? Love the video! x
Omg I came to watch you when the show came to my city and now my school announced today that we are doing the Addams family as our school musical this year! I'm so happy!
We were at the Saturday show. So sad not to see you proform. You did the right thing though and we enjoyed the show all the same. Hopefully we can come see you in something else soon xxx
your hair looks so good at this length :)
When I saw 'Hippo' in the title, my brain immediately went, Hippo Campus! (the band) and thought Carrie was gonna talk about seeing them live or something... guess I've been watching too many Hippo Campus vids...
Omg he died?? That's so sad 😨😰
Can you get it in? It's not really in is it? Looks like a turtle head - sounds like the time I lost my virginity.
ahhh i miss england so much watching your vlogs carrie but they really help me feel closer to home! <3 i wish i could come and watch the musical but unfortunately i'm a poor british uni student living in australia! i've had one normal night on loop since i first listened to it this morning and im in awe of the notes and lyrics <3
Hearing you sing made me happy💜 glad your feeling better.xx.
as always this has made me so happy! Except, of course, for Archie. Rest In Peace!
Awh seeing you at the Hippodrome makes me homesick for Bristol! I love that venue!
Today was my birthday and it kind of felt like I shared it with you, Olie and the cast of the adams family
I was meant to watch you in Bristol but have been really ill for 6 months and didn't make it :( I hope I can get to see it when I'm better next year! Really hope the show went well! XXX
Did you not leave small holes in the mouse box? 😂 bless you!
I missed your live transmition at Instagram. Had to work. So, I'm glad I can see this...
You should sneak a little tribute to Archie into the show somehow...RIP Archie
It’s weird seeing yourself in a video......
Your hair is getting so long!!
Very weird to watch you rehearsing where I used to set out interval drinks working front of house! Wish I could come and see the show, but hope the Hippos treat you well :)
haha the hippodrome is literally down the road from where i live. also visit the cat cafe there it's so lovely!! they make great tea
thank you for sharig such a unique memory. and really sorry and sad that archie didn't make it. thank you for taking care of him.
First off, I'm so glad to hear you have your voice back, Carrie!! It's great to see you up and running again! Also, OHMIGOD Scott as Fester!! Even if it was just a glimpse, I'm so happy to see it! I hope we can see more of that in the future!\n\nAs for Oliver learning the Ancestor choreo, I did the exact same thing when I was in Mary Poppins at my community theatre. I was dubbed The Unofficial Swing after that lol. It's just sooo much fun to learn other people's stuff. I don't have a real explanation why 😅
Whenever I see people in the Addams Family hoodies I think they're the Sixth Form hoodies from my school, and I'm like 'no way you went to.... oh wait no you didn't, and it happens almost every time.
where do you stay while on tour?\nand im coming to see you in Milton Keynes in October. How do I get a signed photo? xx
I've been watching these videos every week and I'm so excited to see the show at the Grand Theatre in Wolverhampton next month 🤗🎉💗 I was in an amateaur production of this a few years back so I know all the songs and will be lip syncing along to them when I see the show! Buzzing! 💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻
i love the length of your hair, it really suits you
Bristol ❤️ I've just finished studying there and If you're looking for places to go I've got some recommendations: \n- Pinkmans bakery on park street (fab doughnuts) \n- Playground cafe near st Nicks markets (is has SWINGS) \n- The view from Brandon hill park is amazing (especially if you're a skins fan) \n- if you want a night out, kongs on king street is a bar with table football and great music, and Thekla is a club on a boat (plays cheesey music on a Saturday)
So weird seeing you in my home towns (I live between Bath and Bristol) I saw you as Jane in Mary Poppins in Bristol all those years ago but saw you as Wednesday in Bath. Have fun in Bristol, there is a really cool magic bar just around the corner from the theatre and the pizza place just up the road does the best greasy 2am pizza!!
You are not in room 4??? 😮
Seeing you perform tomorrow! Hope that your voice is okay and that Archie lives.
This is the first time I’m watching a Carrie video at uni. I like it.
As an inspiring actor. I love watching your vlogs and hope one day I'll be as successful as you ☺️💜👊🏻
I saw you in Manchester, you were SO AMAZING! The cast is so, so talented I want to watch it again! I wish you luck for the rest of the tour xx <3
So excited to see you in Addams in October! I would really really like a signed photo and was wondering where I could get one, or how to please!?! Thank you Carrie xoxoxox
Just came back from seeing the show loved every minute always dreamed of being Wednesday Adams . You are amazing performer ❤️👏🏼
I'm doing the Addams family with a theatre program
So glad to hear you voice is better, it must have been tough for you when your voice is everything; as an artist if I lost use of my hand it would be awful!
Speaking of theatre mice! I saw you on the matinee of you last day at Les Mis and there was a mouse in the stalls! Prompted everyone to sit cross legged on the chairs for the whole of the second act!!!
Lovely video as always Carrie, RIP Archie Addams! Maybe he can join the show as an ancestor 😂🖤
I performed in fame at the hippodrome in the summer of 2016 and I was on the top floor (second from the end on the right). But omg it's so hot up there!! I was sat in my bra when I wasn't in the dressing room as I couldn't function
Love seeing all the crazy intense vocal warm-ups you do!
I so wanted to come and watch the show this week but had no one to go with 😪 enjoy your time in bristol!
Omg I know the chip shop you mean !! It's right by that cat cafe you walked past there, I was there a few weeks ago and admired the Sheridan Smith autographs!!
That booty though Carrie! ❤️🍑 You're gorgeous inside and out 😘😘
i have never been more sad about a mouse dying :( :( :( :( :(
You have a good heart Carrie. Goodbye Archie, we hardly knew ye...
What a morbid ending 😂 was hoping archie would pull through but ya know, great vlog regardless carrie!
So glad that you're feeling better now! It's wonderful to see you smiling since I know last week was difficult for you 🖤
I'm sad that there wasn't a watch me Wednesday for when you was in Sheffield! R.I.P Archie </3
Your photos are gorgeous especially the Wednesday one. Awwww Archie 😘😘
Watched the show tonight and I am still in awe!
my sister and I came to see the show tonight, you guys were fab!! ♥
I love carrie with jeans, glasses and hair up!!!!!!!!! 😊😊
We're loving having you at the hippo this week! So funny seeing you around where i work! Came to see the show on Tuesday and loved it. Been dancing along during my FOH shifts too 🙈 also, send Scott some extra love please! He's nailing it as Fester! ❤️🌚🖤
The restaurant is called Rendezvous and they do awesome cheesy chips. 💕 Nice to see you in my hometown ☺️
JUST WATCHED ADDAMS FAMILY AND IT IS AMAZING!!! THE WHOLE CAST IS SO TALENTED!!! WELL DONE CARRIE ASWELL YOU WERE SOOOOO GOOOD!!!!!!!! 💖💖💖
Man I wish I lived in the U.K. so bad so I could see you perform!!
I live in Bristol! I couldn't get tickets to you're show cause im poor 😂but omg
Where can I get an Oliver?!
Saw you in Bristol and it was so breath taking xxx the songs are in my head constantly ❤️❤️❤️
RIP Archie we hardly knew ye
rip archie :(
**glasses nose twitch**
Awwww, rest in peace, little Archie Addams
I love bristol
awww i miss archie
Wherew your tahirt from? Its lovely x
Is Scott uncle fester forever now?!
You were brilliant. Tonight was awesome 😊
No, not Archie!!😔
R.I.P Archie 🐀🐁
ok im really sad about archie
Recreate the picture!!!
Check out St Nicholas Market in Bristol, also in Cabot Circus they have a shop called flying tiger which I think you would love!
How come Scott is playing Uncle Fester now? Les Dennis was finished with his part? I'd love to see more of his version of the character in other vlogs :D Also, Oliver's ancestor dance routine was impressive!
I love you.\nI love your books.\nI love your love for books.\nI love your voice.\nI love you attitude to life.\nI love what you do. \nI love everything about you.
I love seeing the warm ups. By  this point I'm guessing you guys are used to it, no matter how much fun it is, but it seems like such a magical process in my head. I was in a theatre course for over 2 years but my grandmother took me off of it before I could actually participate in anything remotely close to this (it was for health reasons, my grandma is a wonderful woman and only did what was best for me). I wish I could be part of a musical at some point ❤️ I'd love it.
7:12 boyonce I've NEVER laughed so hard in my life 😂❤
😟 Am I the only one who realizes the bassinet no longer should be use for the baby, Alessia has gotten bigger and and the basket is just too snug  of a fit for her. Please guys really get her something bigger to sleep in. I'm afraid that's an accident waiting too happen. I hope u take this as a well intended advice. 🙂
Such a a touching  moment seeing Anna massaging Alessia and seeing Emilia brushing her own teeth after seeing her get her teeth brush by Jonathan and Anna for so long
Emilia - they might stop being strict if i tell them i'm sick' aha omg cute
The part in the video where Anna is massaging Alessia was so sweet. I hope you feel better soon Emelia!
They probably had to cut the intro cause Eduardo started picking his nose 😂❤️
Hi Guys , I can't help but notice Alessia, is in need a cot/crib not much room for her in her bassinet/Moses basket. Even if you just Put here In a portable cot for the know , until you move To your new home ..I feel she needs more space are air in here sleeping environment. \nSorry are not having a disrespectful dig at you, just a friendly surgestion . \nI come from nursing back round,  a mother, being a care bear,looking out for you and your family as always 💜😘❤️
Stop putting your kids life in your videos and make good content
Emilia reading was so precious. She's so grown up now! I remember watching in the older vlogs, her tripping on the Peppa boots when she was trying to walk. Too cute!
aww i'm so happy they played Tom Rosenthal in the video one of my favourite singers!
I also have the malaria/scabies aka a cold 🤧 🤧🤧
I like cheese greated on my mash and sometimes be cheeky and have tuna and salad cream in there to that's the best in a jacket potato x
still putting Alessia in that basket face down
wow you guys have really let the dogs faces go. last year I mentioned a way to keep them from staining. but I guess you didn't see it.  the poor pups look a little unkept that way. they're spoiled lol pooches .... its just you needed to prevent it from getting this bad. 😞\nmaybe shave off a little of the dirty faces..lol. love you guys..
I would say Alessia  is getting a bit big for the Moses basket ! They grow so fast :( my daughter only managed four months in there lol
u guys r awesome happy ppl and thats the kind of ppl we all wanna meet xx shud come to australia xx
Awwwww Emilia I have the sniffles too and a sore throat. Had to be now we go on holiday on saturday
What WHSmith is it for Glasgow like can you give the street because I have a ticket and I'm not too sure where it is
This must be old footage because the part when Jonathan notices Anna switched his wine for a dogs toy in the fridge was on her Snap awhile back.
I came across your videos by total accident a few days ago and now I'm addicted. Your family is adorable and the love you all share is so sweet. Your family makes me so excited to start my own family and become a mum just like Anna. You just put a smile on my face. Such a beautiful kind loving family <3  xx Thank you xx
Hi (sorry for bad English)
Definitely Anna's dinner with the peas and sauce but I do like beans with baked potatoes :)
Anna 's old long hair is back
I liked the style of this vlog. Kinda reminded me of some sort of realty TV or family show😍 really cool
I ordered Cloudy Bay with my dinner at a restaurant because of you!
I'd prefer your dinner with the beans Jonathan :)
Is that a birth mark on the baby and is it going to be there for life?\nSorry, I'm sure this is asked a million times but I haven't watched in a couple months.
I love the fact that  Anna is such a loving mama to her babies!!! Love ya Anna...
OMG! I will show this video to my 1yearold, so she can see how other children cleaning teeth. :)
This is what we call... scary music. THE SNIFFLES DUN DUN DUNNNNN
After working in multiple nurseries and schools I found myself singing along with Eduardo to the wind the bobbin up song 🙈🙋🏼💙 x
Come to New Zealand
Your jumper/sweatshirt in the beginning is too small Joffey!!
I want to come to the Bluewater tour however my mum is going to go to Manchester 😕❤️
Please come to Singapore!!!❤❤❤
Emilia and Eduardo grew up so quickly😭❤️😭
Alessia developing a lollipop addiction 😂 If It worked that  way ,that would  certainly explain my coffee addiction !😂🍭☕️
I love Jonathon's facial expressions and the way he talk into the camera as well.  It reminds me of Ricky Gervais in 'The Office'!  He is so funny! 💕
What song is playing on the morning run?
Got so emotional watching all the old clips of Emilia at the meet and greets <3 seriously feels like I've watched her and Eduardo (and now Alessia) grow up. Glad you guys are making progress in your recovery <3 RIP Squiddyyyyy <3 <3 <3
You guys go for eating vegetarian sausages
omg baby emilia ❤❤
Eduardos relationship with Alessia is the cutest!!! 😍😍😍
*Are уоu lооking for hоt dаtеs in уour nеighbourhоod?*

L9x9V1y_8YQ,\n *Theу hеre ➤➤* http://gozon.ru/hot/?v=L9x9V1y_8YQ_999748
Ooooh  their dinner makes me v hungry! 😋
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3F-STRSMEo
Those flashbacks omg 😭😭 time flies
👏👏👏🙋🙋🙋❤❤❤❤
Love you guys❤️💗
Aww
Hi guys Alessia Emilia erdo
ANNA You're so stunning!!! You're one hot mama!!! <3
It's so sweet watching Anna with the kiddos 💖 My first baby is due in 20 days so it makes me even more excited for future special moments like that.  P.s. The buttery the potatoes the better,  but cheesy mashed potatoes are the ultimate potatoes!
Oml I've been absent from YouTube for so long and I can't believe how much Emilia and Eduardo have grown!
this episode is so true and stripped back, i respect them so much for showing life in all aspects!
I have to agree with Reception being quite Strict. I understand they’re at school but they’ve literally just started and they’ll still be in nursery mode until they’ve settled in properly.
Little Alessia is such a smiley,happy baby! She seems to be such a good little girl!
Thank's for the all time catchy tune Bianca bebo babe song. Rrrrgggggh
Need to do another bikefriend was so fun last year and was so lucky to be apart of it
The way you put Alessia to nap i think its not save they care
It's so amazing seeing Alessia grow into her own little person.
0:59 The zooming in to their faces edits  always cracks me up 😂 It's like The Office type of comedy mockumentary editing.
If Emilia is finding reception strict she is really gonna struggle when she gets to my age (in year 10)😳💓💓💓💓
Just so sad that you're not coming to the US.
Anna looks so beautiful in this video
Emilia high fiving the crowd was so so cuteeeeeew xxx
When Eduardo sang Good morning again, .... I started crying. So sweet to see him carrying on the tradition ❤️❤️
You don’t realize how much Emilia and Eduardo have grown up until Jonathan posts old videos 😭😭😭😭😭😭
What as Anna saying at 4:13please?
It’s amazing, I honestly remember like it’s was yesterday when Eduardo couldn’t walk really good and Emília couldn’t talk so much and now they are so big and cute and smart ♥️♥️
I would choose the mash with pepper on top, vegetarian sausages and beans :):) :):)
I am a Junior in high school now , which means I will finish school next year and it's crazy how fast time has passed, watching Emilia and Eduardo always makes me miss being that age
Cant wait to meet you both in glasgow
I really want to be like Anna when I'm a mother, she's actually so amazing and is doing such a great job !!
My god my son is doing that with the toilet paper 😂😂😂 anyone has an advise how to stop him 😂😂😂
I'm so excited to meet use in Belfast 😊😊 Me and my friends are so excited❤
I really wish you wouldn't rinse after brushing your teeth!!!!
THEY WERE LISTINING TO LITTLE MIX IN THE CAR AT THE START!!! MY FANGIRL HEARTTTTT
You should come to Aberdeen!😁 xx
When you read a comment and that part happens in the video 😮
When the wine bottle squeaked i laughed so loud
Watching these vlogs really makes me see how fast time goes
emilia brushing her teeth was the cutest thing ever ❤️
OMGGG ALLESIAS LITTLE TEEFIES ARE POKING OUT
9:00 guys imagine teenage emilia doing makeup tutorials omg
Sausage, Mash, and Beans! 100%
I love beans more
Come to Pennsylvania
definitely prefer Annas dinner
cloudy bay takes the pain away hahahaha
Ya çocuk boğulacak daha geniş bir yataģa yatırsanızya yazık.😠😡
Love u all ! ❤❤❤❤
Hi
My favourite dinner is chicken curry
Buttery potatoes and peas for SURE!
Eduardo is going to be amazing with babies and little kids when he grows up. I really can’t wait to see him with kids of his own.
Emilia sounds like an Englander! Why did they leave Ireland??
Heeeeey guys I'm a huge fan I watch your guys blogs everyday all the kids are adorable I wish I could come to the book tour but I can't because I live all the way over in New Zealand xxx
Sorry but I'd rather Anna's sausage and mash only because I really hate butter😂😂
Edwardo is the baby whisperer
So jumanji can change it's appearance depending on the year. So what would it look like in 2017????
Don't let this distract you from the fact that Kevin was cheating on his pregnant wife during the production of this movie.
ima check this out lmao it dont seem bad at all im finna pull up to the theater geeked
Feels like jack black and Kevin hart are what's going to make this movie decent
The Rock is the new Adam Sandler of action movies.
Nooo don’t ruin jumanji. This looks like an okay film but it shouldn’t be related to jumanji, just. \n\nNo. Thanks.
Atleast we know the makers have a good taste in music
I'm so sick of this big bald faggot in every movie there are actual actors thay could play this part so much better than a monotone one move eyebrow lift puke
Kevin Hart is too funny!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂 ...that is the most interesting thing I've seen cake do
I feel like they should have left the explosion at the end out. Having him say am I still black? It's all good was funny enough for the trailer and they could have left that for another surprise in the movie
This should not be called jumanji... that's not how the game works. Should be called something else entirely.
Wth is this S$#%! I love the Rock but this is complete garbage. No reason they should have titled this movie Jumanji. This just shows Hollywood struggles to make new things. I love the original movie Robin Williams.
Love all the actors it makes me do happy
Can't people come up with new film ideas instead of just recycling older ones?
But i hope so not will be something cheesy funny shit.
i hope this be moive 😏
Good job with the cliché welcome to the jungle
Hey guys look!  It's Dwayne Johnson and kevin hart together... Again
I mean it looks good just have questions
I want xqc to do the intro he'll be like welcome to the jungle my dude thanks fr being part of the dream lol
am i still black? then we r fine
This looks like its gonna be Amazing!!! Jack Black (promoted it a little in Infinite Challenge), Karen Gillan yes!! (Still Amy Pond to me) , The Rock again Yes!!
IT'S A 3 IN 1: The Rock, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart
i love how they put two decades and it sounds like a lot of time but it’s just twenty years
I like can't even with this place hahaha 😂😂😂
Can you smell what the Cock is rooking?
Kevin hart isn't funny the rock is horrible in every movie including The fast and furious movies yes they all suck ass the only good choice in this movie was jack black
Can't wait for this 👌🔥
This looks interesting lol.. also I can’t believe how far down I scrolled without seeing a single Whovian comment 😒
Ok, this may actually be a good movie.
It's all go-\n\n*blows up*
they are literally using Jumanji's name to get that box office profits, why can't they just call it some irrelevant/unrelated name like The Jungle or something?
What a shit movie. Stop remaking movies you lazy bastards
Why are there holograms? Why is there a bazaar with friendly people in it? Why are the only bad guys a bunch of bikers The Rock could easily beat up? Why is the Rock even in this?
The black guy typecast as the comedian with the one liners. Standard Hollywood.
I'm usually skeptical of all comedy movies but this looks pretty damn funny
I miss Robin Williams. It would have been awesome if he could have had a cameo in this 😔
This is going to be one dumb funny ass movie
There's something about the original though with them being at home
a reboot/modern sequel that actually seems funny! hmmm
The gamer stereotypes in this movie make it unwatchable.
I think I'll still with the original. Thanks, but no thanks.
It's already normal at this point for Kevin Hart to be playing games
Two days after I leave for RTC noooooo
I've disliked this video twice already and it keeps removing it. This movie is a Sony fuck fest of garbage. With or without the Jumanji name it looks like shit. How'd Baywatch work out for you? Hahahahaha
Looks like shit....why is Sony flopping every where
Cake is my weakness 😏- Kevin Hart 2017
Trailer 1: god help us\n\nThis one: huh, actually this might be good...
I hate that I don't hate this.
Damn I'm kinda excited...\nFirst glance i was THEFUCKKK
Am I still black? Well were fine (explosion) \n\nMe: LMAO bro that was so funny
I'm into it
Way to many niggers in movies.  I'm sick of seeing feral blacks with pretty white women.  To many timid wimpy whites carry the water for the blacks.
OK now I wanna c it...  😊
yeahhh rock and kevin is back together
Good film done poorly, is how you can define every single reboot
Whenever I see Karen Gillan I just think of Amy pond
Should've showed the trailer in November, comes out on Christmas? Way to long
Wow is a very cool video
Oh haha. I see what they did there...looks awesome!
I can already tell they're gonna fuck this up, it's a great idea for a movie tho
Please let it be funny and tolerable
looks like a fun movie, \nplus karen gillan looks smokin' in that tombraiderish getup ;-3
Love me some Rock!
Gotta watch it
Kevin Hart has the same weakness as Jacksepticeye!
Me: The rock - aw fuck yeahSees Kevin hart- pass.
I like can't even with this place
Is this buffed egghead in every single movie now? Geez. The guy can't even act.
Kevin he's da best
Originally I wasn't happy about this movie because to me the original Robin Williams film is all the world need. BUT the fact it's a video game style Jumanji is actually pretty cool. The cast looks alright and overall I think this movie could be really good. I hope it does well and people enjoy it.
The only matters that interests me is the girl with the red shirt
In the wise words of Adam Jenson:\n\n\n_I never asked for this_
Thank god you changed back to your old profile pic!
You're ruining our nostalgia!! Come up with a new fucking idea for once and put your generic 2017 bullshit spin to it. You ruin everything!! LEAVE THE PAST ALONE! :'(
I thought this movie came out months ago....
this is gonna be lit
Stupid
AWESOME! !!
Just no
hope i wont be disappointed
Please do not disappoint.
I LOVE THIS OML 😂😂
This looks too good🤣
definitely watching
This movie will suck.
I'm interested
TRASH
No.
Karren Gillan <3 <3
Coll
Honey they blew up Kevin Hart.
This actually looks pretty funny. Shocked.
Greed island!
Karen Gillan - Amy Pond ❤️
Well this looks fucking trash!!!!
THIS IS EPIC
*Am I still black ??? lmfao*
Wonder woman sucked balls!
Jumanji.....😁
Loved this, loving the mustard jumper and the cable knit one too (can't beat a cable knit!). Also loved your background when you were with Emma too, that made me laugh. And I won't blame you for the fact you said I had 3 girls- you've only cuddled him a fair few times now ;) x
I'm wearing a bra, that's enough me too Louise me too
The pink hair suits you so well!!! I love the pastel
That chunky mustard sweater on Monday was beautiful, love it!
Love it! Cat bag is purrrrrrfection <3
Emma was my favourite part of this video!!!! 😂
Where is the cat bag from? I need it 💕
Aww you're so sweet ❤ plus i love the outfits
Louise love this! I'm 17 weeks pregnant and feeling so crappy no motivation for clothes/hair/makeup ECT so it's great to see another mummy pulling it off giving me some inspiration...you look amaze 😍
I'm living for that yellow orange sweater omg 💀❤️
I'd love to see more videos like this. I'm a curvy girl and it's hard to find a lot of people who do these types of videos that have similar body shape and fashion taste as me. These outfits (and all your outfits, really) give me tons of inspiration! Love it~ ♡
Loved this idea and video! Would definitely like to see more 👍🏻
Haha the leggings comment! I'm 26 weeks pregnant with my first and leggings have become my life!  Great video I'm off on a look out for Monday's chunky knit .... thanks for the vid xx
I love watching Louise and her fashion videos. Im a big person myself and constantly wear basic clothes to try and hide myself, but louise looks fabulous in anything she wears even whilst pregnant. Watching her gives me the urge to go out and do a bit of shopping for myself. Especially ow its autumn and winter and time to start wrapping up and getting cosey. I basically live in jeggins or joggers with a vest top and hoody. And have the same 3 outfits constantly on wash, wear, repeat. Id love to go shopping with louise! Hope to see more :) x
You always look so put together and nice! Seriously how?! X
I love the pink hair. It really suits you!
I really want to see Louise and dan&phil do a collab when the baby is born🙈🙈🙈
Louise I simply love everything about you. Sending lotsandlots of love from Finland  ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Oh my god I love Lindsey Kelk's books she's amazing! You look so gorgeous in all of these Louise!!
The blue vest from Primark suits you so well🤗
That Teddy lipstick from Mac looks incredible on you❤️❤️
Hey Louise, been watching you since your first pregnancy all those years ago! It's been amazing to watch your journey and grow with you, - has to be said i'm noticing a lot of black in this video and as you were saying you were feeling a little flat i'm hoping this isn't coming out / taking its toll on your fabulously glittery wardrobe! - I've never seen anyone rock a sequin like you , you are and look beautiful and shine regardless but I hope you reignite your glitter fire soon -!  x
Love how real this is 💗
Can’t seem to be able to open the links for your Thursday comfy outfit... can you pls let me know where the trousers and top are from? Thanks x
Loved this especially that little Animal print belt so cute
I love outfit videos like this, I always find some sort of inspiration. :)
Love this! Keep doing these types of videos! Love seeing your outfits 😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
More if these, please! Great video.
Oh my gosh I love your bump!! You look so happy <3
Did you tell Zoe about this to or did she just randomly decide to do it at the same time also lol
you are as cute as a bug!   oops that means very cute in case you never heard that term..lol...
I really enjoyed this! Would def love more vids like it :)
Louise said Oh and my home phone started ringing. I almost had a heart attack.
love this! Want to see more please 😊
OMG I JUST GOT HOME FROM WORK AND FOUND THAT YOUR BOOK CAME IN THE MAIL IM SO EXCITED 😍😍😍
I love this!! First outfits my fav ❤️
You are so freaking cute and beautiful! Love the pink hair :)
LOVED the lip colour on thursday!!!
Love love love all of the outfits Louise!
I feel I need to see leggings that many times in a week... Loving your style xx
I love this video!
Outfit diary?! Just like Zoe's?!

Where do your taxes go?? Wars? Military? Not only is the healthcare a joke but the pharmaceutical industry is huge and that means more sick people more profits.. They also make money on wars. The whole system needs to change.  If you took away the glitz and glamour of Hollywood, Broadway, Washington DC, music, film and sports its almost like a semi functioning third world country.
Thank you Jimmy for exposing the lie that Senator Cassidy and his Republican supporters of their proposed health care bill. It is a scam and it needs to be exposed for what it is. Thank you!
What a joke.  He even said that he's not an expert, but thinks socializing the entire system will result in the most perfect healthcare system ever, where everyone is safe from everything and best of all it doesn't cost any money! Which frankly, is flat out impossible. Socialized healthcare leads to two things: rationing and substantial debt. So damn you jimmy, stick to talking about your expertise in pizza eating, because you are a daft S.O.B. when it comes to anything else.
People are trying to produce thunder without the lightning.  Jimmy Kimmel just said every socialist nation has figured out healthcare.  That may be true to some extent, but the United States is not a socialist nation except when it comes to the government's desires and of course Wall Street's desires.  I could solve America's health care problem very easily, cover every single person from cradle to grave, even pay for the birth and funeral, and do it without excessive taxation at all.  How?  It's very simple.  A small transaction tax.  America does TRILLIONS of transactions each year.  if you imposed a small tax on each transaction, it would generate HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS of dollars to be used EXCLUSIVELY for the health care of Americans.  In other words, Congress is forbidden from using the revenue for anything than Healthcare for Americans.  Then you put in place CAPS on procedures that hospitals can charge nationwide, those caps adjusted for inflation every 10 years or so.  For those Hospitals that charge below 50 percent of the cap for a procedure, they get a income tax credit.  This would be an incentive driving the cost of procedures DOWN.  I would happily pay the tax rather than pay an insurance company 500 dollars or more each month for a service that I probably won't even use that month.  And here's the caveat.  DO NOT exempt Wall Street from the transaction tax.  This plan raises the revenue to be used EXCLUSIVELY for Healthcare of Americans and it gives incentives for hospitals to charge LESS for their services.
He didn't even read the bill...
This is the President people voted for. I've been saying since day one this is one big circus and the people who don't care about us are taking us for a ride.
I never understood why you don't have a decent health cover in the US. It's unbelievable...I'm French and I know I would never have to worry about money if I get sick in my country. In the US, they let people die ! Are we in 2017 or in the middle age ?
Don't worry about it Jimmy you got the cash!
It's easy to listen to Kimmel when he talks about the 4 promises and go booooo. But I urge that you do the underlying research for each claim and realize it's not as simple as this and he is not entirely accurate. If you still wanna boooo go right ahead, but do so with a full understanding of the material.
Get this to number 1 trending
This is one time I wish I wasn't Canadian just so I could call that number.  I hope any American who has seen this video will take the 5 mins and call.
Yeah -- all of those countries he listed off have to ration their health services. No thanks. People who think Obamacare does any of the things Jimmy Kimmel complains this bill doesn't do is completely moronic.\n\nAlso, Obamacare wasn't transparent before it was passed. It was brought about the same way Kimmel is complaining about.\n\nHealthcare is complicated. There is no answer for how to get affordable, good quality health care for everyone and there never will be. You can have 2 but not 3. Again, the countries which he compares the US to have to ration their health services because it's making them go broke. Japan is on the verge of having to ration, but then again, they don't have tens of millions of illegal people in their country who are on welfare and don't pay taxes (like we do in our country). Don't take my word for it, do some simple research. \n\nI feel for Jimmy and his kids heart surgery, don't get me wrong. But as a doctor who has intimate knowledge of how the healthcare system works, I can only see this monologue as politicizing a personal experience as an answer to an extremely complicated issue. \n\nBy the way -- where Kimmel took his kid to get open heart surgery is a charity hospital, and the surgeon who performed the surgery performs it on poor kids just the same as he does people like Kimmel.
Yes, let's create a big, national, faceless bureaucracy that cost billions. Oh wait that's Medicare.
I'm sick of many liberal Hollywood celebrity types voicing their political opinions, rudely, offensive, disrespectful and mostly cowardly, you are all despicable, so I speak for millions of us that do not agree with you. So I will respond this way like the millions may follow, we need not support you and the rest, movies, TV,  most of the films being produced lately are horrible so is the crap on TV.  Let me not forget the lying media, such CNN, MSNBC, CBS, NBC ABC,  Washington Post, New York Times.  I did see the Emmy Awards on the news, I never thought much about actors because most of them are assholes,  they're on drugs, alcoholics,  and suicidal  but what I dislike the most is when they stand there  in front of a large crowd spewing political  bullshit and threats, holding up decapitated head, threatening to blow up the white house, your as bad as the antfa, kkk, blm, neo nazis.  Do what you're paid for, act, sing, dance, host your show, but shut the f**k up with your bullshit opinions, we don't care and of you  look like fools doing it.
Jimmy Kimmel is just a puppet of the left and shame on him for using his son for political reasons.
America has money for wars but not for its own people lol talk about old men in suits destroying the world. Profit over people, I guess.
I deeply believe the level of civilization is defined how it treats it's weakest, like children, the elderly and the poor. I simply fail to understand how a country like the US fails to provide decent health care to everybody. Maybe you should send your congressmen and -women here to europe or Japan to see how it's done. Do not be fooled!
Jimmy is the best!
if obama care is so great, why is it collapsing, some states only have one carrier or now, none...
God bless you, Jimmy Kimmel!  Wish others with a huge platform would do the same as you--defending the American People!
Kimmel is SUCH A TOOL! He is as out of touch with reality as is Congress and the SENATE. Try paying $1800.00 per month for a family of THREE and tell me how it is. MORONS!
Cassidy was lied at yep. think about it, when have you ever seen a politician give you a short answer (let alone one semi-word) on a topic the actually care about?
Anther thing Jimmy refuses to bring up, probably because he doesn't know, is that all of the things he's crying about now are  true of Obamacare.  The laws right now, like lifetime caps, are in place throughout most of the country. There's no health care plan anywhere in the world that's completely free and unlimited surgery for everyone at any time. What he's wanting doesn't exist now And had never existed in history. There's simply not enough money.
I love how your so passionate about protecting the American people. Keep up the great work.
Jimmy Kimmel is correct this man is not being honest.  While I agree, Healthcare belongs within the jurisdiction of the states, it never belonged to the Federal Government, but to return it now to them, OMG what madness -- do you see what's working in these agencies today, they're not functioning now, could you imagine the biggest disaster in American History falling into their laps, NO ONE WILL HAVE HEALTHCARE BUT THE ILLEGALS AND MINORITIES.  WHAT NERVE THESE GUSSIES WHO HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO BUSINESS BEING IN CONGRESS MAKING VERY IMPORTANT DECISIONS IN OUR LIVES THAT HAVE US ON THE ROPES FOR DECADES DUE TO OUR POOR JUDGMENT.  JIMMY KIMMEL HITS THE NAIL RIGH ON THE HEAD THIS BILL IS INDEED A SCAM! THEY SCREWED UP TAKING IT ON IN THE FIRST PLACE,  AND NOW THEY'RE DUMPING THEIR SCREW UP ONTO STATE GOVERNMENT  SO THEY CAN JUST WALK AWAY AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED!!  AS JIMMY KIMMEL SAYS, ITS ALL ABOUT THE MONEY, AND GUESS WHAT WE DON'T HAVE IT ANYMORE.  FORGET ABOUT SENIORS AND VETS, THE IMPENDING DISASTER WOULD BE NATIONWIDE, SPEAK ABOUT BIAS, MY GOD  AS JIMMY KIMMEL SO WISELY POINTS OUT THE ONLY ONE WHO WILL HAVE HEALTHCARE COVERAGE IS JIMMY KIMMEL FOR BEING JIMMY KIMMEL. UNBELIEVEABLE!!!!  Turn healthcare over to Niki Haley, hahahahahaha....its not funny, but she is just one of the clowns who took over the circus for crying out loud!!!!  Well say adios to me if this horror goes their way as I suspect it will because we are just backing up and backing up and backing up paying our bills making them even stronger tyrants.  Oh what's the use? WE CREATING CHAOS, WE EVEN MORE NUTS THAN CASSIDY IS  FOR CHRIST SAKE.  DO NOT, DO YOU HEAR ME, DO NOT LET THEM WIPE THEIR FEET OFF AND GO OFF INTO THE SUNSET WHILE EVERYONE IS FORCED TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES IN CHAOS, THE COSTS ARE HEALTHCARE ARE WAY TO HIGH, WAY, WAY TO HIGH, FORGET THE MEDICATIONS. WE CAN'T TAKE THEM, SO WE REALLY CAN'T GO TO THE DOCTOR ANYWAY RIGHT?  WE'RE COOKED ELECTING THE LAWYERS TO CONGRESS WHAT PART OF BEING SWORN TO THE JUDICIARY ARE YAS HAVING TROUBLE WITH EXACTLY? AND ITS BECAUSE OUR ELITE HAVE BECOME THE ROBBERBARRONS OF OLD!!!!  THEY'RE A GET RICH QUICK SCHEME.  What a disaster.  Jimmy Kimmel, I know its not your area of expertise, but I must say to you, you are already better at it than most in congress today.  There are no accidents, Jimmy Kimmel, if God chose you, he chose you.  My prayers are with your precious little boy, may he enjoy a speedy and complete recovery, but as for you, it is time for you to fight.  Thank you.  ITS TIME FOR ALL OF US TO FIGHT.
No surprise. Doctors and the medical establishment are the biggest crooks in society. A fact many people don't recognize. And their lobbyists are some of the strongest. Cassidy is a doctor. Go figure.
the government and the corporations are the farmers the rest of the american citizens are just\n cattle, so start producing for your masters
This is what I hate about American politics, anyone who disagrees with me is awful and the other party is always wrong
I clicked but didn't call because I'm in the UK and health care is free 😀
Health care is not about political positions. \nWe cannot let it divide us. We are better than that.\nWe all need care at some point. Our families all need it at some point. Will it be available for us or only for the wealthy?\nRemember that...
Trust me, I LOVE this video and completely support everything Kimmel just said. However, he has to realize that he is somewhat almost enabling this Trump era politics by not only bring then candidate Trump on his show to humanize, but now Sean Spicer and buddying up with him, making him look like a nice guy. Kimmel also took part in some really sexist skits back in his SNL days, but that's not as relevant right now . I hate to say this, I mean Kimmel is such a likable guy, but I tend to look at the world objectively and call out hypocrisy and praise when needed no matter who it is. Just because this political topic personally affects him ad his family, he is willing to give it it's justified platform. However, being an advocate is more than just speaking out when it directly affects you, but being aware of all of your actions and how they affect the bigger picture as well, especially when you are privileged and lucky enough to have such a large platform and make an actual difference to millions of supportive Americans that could truly benefit and listen to you.
Huge props Jimmy Kimmel.  Keep doing what you're doing.  I'm from Australia.  Ours is a hybrid system with a Private option but a basic guaranteed safety net for all, especially the most at risk. It's not perfect but it works. It can be done, all it requires is the will to do it.
this is pathetic.... you can't control the market with government regulation, all the kids who studied economics and finances are the selfish last 20-30 years are the ones who cook up this whole profit gaining eco system of un-fair insurance industry, if only they have a conscience.
Do not stop fighting for all sick .
It's not complicated at all, just copy the system from another country (I think Europe is OK)
Thanks for calling him out..  their is only one Healthcare system that can work morally.   SINGLE PAYER...  Stop profiting on the sick
So... This bill is bad for many Americans and all these people can do is calling Jimmy Kimmel a Liberal shill?? In case if you don't realize, this bill will affect you guys too!
Look the thing is, Republicans leaders have figured it all out , they know most Americans are too busy or have short memory when it comes details in politics , so republicans leaders can go on TV and say anything,  Just because you don't take an interest in politics, it doesn't mean politics won't take an interest in you.
JIMMY KIMMEL IS A SAINT
I'm so grateful that I live in a country where we all pay for everyone's healthcare through taxes! Healthcare and education should be available for everyone!
A national healthcare will only remain viable if the basics are in the healthcare (i.e. cavities, eye glasses, broken arms, cancer, etc.), and not the perks (i.e. teeth whitening, transgender surgery, abortions, birth control pills, etc.). Greed will keep the healthcare system in a downward death spiral... and never viable.
I have pre-existing condition and I fear for what this bill will do to me. It is good to hear that Jimmy Kimmel is standing up and speaking out for everyone who needs quality and affordable health insurance
Way to go Jimmy loved the man show but we all grow up!  Me and my neighbors in Alaska all are contacting Murkoski
the audacity of the these scumbags in Congress is astounding
One issue no one consider is price gouging in health business. The prices and fees are on average 250% higher than in Britain which COL is higher.  Compared to 10% in other countries US healthcare devour 25% of GDP. The unfair prices (based on fear of death)  is an important factor in addressing  US healthcare. Hope Mr Kimmel comment on this too.
202-224-3121 need this in the video title!
Well said Jimmy! Its so strange watching this. I'm from the UK. My country and every other 1st world country already has a health service that passes the Jimmy Kimmel test. America! you need to join modern civilization.
live in New Zealand - we have government funded healthcare for everyone. I pay NZ$5 (USA$3.66 at current exchange rate) for 3 month supply of any medication. NZ$18 for doctor visit. No charge for ER or surgery, in fact any hospital care at all - esp giving birth (wtf? - you have to pay for this??).  Mental health services. have an accident - at work, at play, in sports - provided with rehabilitation - and if you can't work - also an income (based on your previous income).  middle class citizen tax rate is 10.5% - 15.5%. max tax rate is 33%.
poor Americans. No one can agree on anything.
Why is it so hard for the US to create a health care system that gives everybody every help they need? I pay an affordable amount every month (my employer gives the same amount to the insurance) and therefore I'll get all the treatments I need if I ever have to receive them. I never had to fear for loosing money because of medical issues. The employer even gives you full loan for the first 6 weeks beeing ill and after that the insurance gives you ca 70% or even nearly 100% if you paid a little extra for such scenarios. No medical issue should make you fear loosing money or your job.
Major props to Jimmy for speaking out about this
in UK we pay 10-12% we call it NI National Insurance, it's a flat rate, like taxes, we all CONTRIBUTE but we don't all use, when ur young you assume you'll never get sick but once u hit 35-45 your body starts to age, we pay for things like prescriptions, but again, it's a flat rate, those with Chronic conditions get free, the culture is to avoid the GP & Dentist unless ur desperate
sad you trust a politician
Republican party = American Taliban.\nThey are against decency, equality,  fairness, science, the environment, the poor. They are for war, discrimination, tax cuts for the rich, corporate interest, anti-science policies. They really deserve that orange haired monster to be their leader.
Three words: Universal Health Care. Good lord, your country is corrupt.
The hell with that
there should be a partylist containing jimmy kimmel,colbert, conan, corden and fallon. The party will be called LATE NIGHT
Jimmy Kimmel for president, he could beat Trump in 2020!!!
Listening to all this health care bill stuff makes me really grateful for the NHS
Jimmy is right. Call your senators and if you can't get through to a person leave a message. They do pay attention to their constituents concerns. That is how their last awful bill was defeated.
Thanks Jimmy. We do have a great health care system here in Canada. Why do they not take an example from the countries that have great coverage?
YOU ROCK JIMMY!! PREACH ON!
bill cassidy looks like a liar
Trumptards don't have the brains to realize they are being robbed and lied to... 😭
Welp.. That's the people in the White House that came up with rocketman and like totally going to nuke N. KOREA.. like OMG totally
I live in CANADA and our health care is not free, we pay with our taxes but if i do not have the income to pay the taxes i am not required to but still get health care. I am grateful living in CANADA.
Jimmy Kimmel is doing exactly what a man with his much power should do. He has a voice that people will listen to. He’s spreading the truth and making sure that we understand that we have to take action now more than ever.
man I'm 20 and just the other day on my morning walk I was thinking about signing up to vote so I can vote on bills and local government and now I watched this video and I'm even more so compelled to sign up.
Thank God for Jimmy Kimmel
#fightback
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!... a politician lied!?!?!?!?!?!?!...smfh...
Jimmy Kimmel For presidend!!
Thank you Jimmy!
Obamacare doesn't pass your test.
Git em!!!💪💪💪
🇨🇦🇨🇦
My dude
Dont piss off jimmy kimmel , got it 👌
Yes yes yes
Call it TrumpDoesn'tCare!
Good guy Jimmy Kimmel.
trump fans have failed America
At least Adam Carolla is still funny.
We need more Kimmels out there
This is why one is communist
What a hack
Ben Shapiro's response to this is all you need to watch.
So now Jimmy's using his platform to go after politicians? good job! ruin late night talk the way Colin Kaepernick ruined the NFL
But he was fine with obama care. Which was the healthcare bill mitt romney made. Everything is bad under trump but not the 7 illegal wars, illegal drone strike assassinations, no arrests on any banker for all the crimes the bankers did, all while obama was president. \nThe entire system is corrupt and everyone will think its fine once trump goes, well it wont.
Thank you Ben Shapiro for breaking down this emotional argument that bears no semblance in reality.
Kimmel shot his mouth off too fast. Now he looks like a fool.
Thank you, thank you, thank you Jimmy!! Sadly the only misunderstanding happening is the GOP not excepting the fact that we KNOW their lying to us. Again thank you Jimmy for being the voice for those of us that feel like the GOP just won't listen. Thank you for your help. Bless you and your family
DO REPUBLICANS KNOW THAT THEY ARE EVIL LIZARDS FROM THE PLANET DEUTCHLAND1000YEARSREIGH????
i want free everything!!!!!!
No hospital is going to turn away a child that is in critical condition no matter what the what care bill is passed. The truth is communist type health care let children die. Maybe Venezuela has better health care. Even in industrialized countries the hospitals look like run down buildings. You need to make an appointment three months in advance and sometimes they don't ser you at all. That's why people fromall over the world come to America with serious health conditions. Libtards are the WAH people.  ☺
Kimmel and his son losers!

I have MS and because my state of Tennessee I can't get insurance. And it is draining us and causing an unnecessary burden. My husband is British and he can't believe how shitty the healthcare is in this country.
For me Angelica is the winner.❤💙💚💛💜
Angelica: I'm so sorry you didn't win. I know that would be so rough on you to get that far, especially at 10 years old. Just know you are beautiful and an AMAZING singer! Oh and ps....i think you deserved to win!
🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Lots of love from Canada 🇨🇦
I will never let go angelica

Please release an album! I see this kid going far
❤️❤️❤️#ZaraLarsson #Sweden 😂😂😂💕💕💕💕👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 i'm from Sweden 💕😂😂👍🏻🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪
More people can sing a song, but less people can sing with additional talent
Her control is amazing
I knew Darci and Angelica was gonna win. Sadly, Preacher didn't win.
Why won't angelica try As If It's Your Last
I'm so proud of her even though she didn't she was amazing and she even gets to perform with darci in Las vegas❤so excited for the both of them
She has to participate in The Voice Kids .... she would totally win
I don't think she did that well on this song. I LOVE HER THOUGH
She is something else
Whether she wins or not, I wish ad hope she will be offered a career or at least school to improve her voice further. This talent is truly amazing even in its pure form! Good luck!
This gave me chills. From Auditions I knew that her or Darci would win
Is that a whistle bomb! WOW!!!!
do we see this little star in vegas
Angelica, I will be following you in the rest of my life !
subscribe in my channel \ni  subscribe in yours
When she reaches puberty i hope she doesnt lose her wonderful voice i was able to sing like that but now that i hit puberty it all changed i can sing but not that well now :(
BRUH SHE IS SO YOUNG HER FUTURE IS BIGGER THAN MY LIFE
She honestly sang it better than Zara live
God, her vocals are better than Zara herself
*_I Am ShOoK_* we're both ten and she will be great for a choir :'0
I wish she won, like omg her voice😩

Please keep on singing and don't give up no matter what. You'll go far with the heart you sing in your voice. Go Angelica :)
I wanted her to winnnnn so bad
She is really amazing I love her so much
We all know you won
She was great but Darci won because she had two talents: singing AND ventriloquism. Darci was always creative in her approach and deserved the win whole heartedly. But Angelica was wonderful. Maybe she’ll fair better in The Voice.
She nailed it but sadly lost.
When this was Sang in The Voice teens Philippines, that grand winner should've been kicked out of the competition but out of luck she survived. This performance is way way better than hers.

To the 1k that disliked this video/performance, please be able to appreciate good talent. This girl went through double pneumonia when she was younger, and she fought hard and survived! Being able to sing at this level after a tragedy like that is amazing! This 10 year old girl has become an idol to those young children who are now suffering. This girl should've won.. #AngelicaHale #StayStrong
and i thought I had a good voice..lol
What the F*k am I watching? 🤢💩👻☠️
I come for Hot Topics, not Wendy Takes Manhattan. Think of all the more gossip we could get in if Wendy stopped flapping that face slit about herself and going off on tangents.
Why do men let NASTY Women Like Chyna trap them??????
This is why I sometimes can't stand Wendy's show because she knowingly promotes messiness...that interview was not only done a month ago but was largely to promote her natural hair care line. There would, of course, be questions surrounding her first marriage but that's for views. Inside edition decided to air the interview basis the current scandal with Kevin Hart....after all the foolishness its clear Eniko and Kevin deserve each other....don't shade Torrei..
Im so glad we don't have most of these disgusting people in the UK. You people need lessons in class and statue
No she was not wrong for going on inside edision...she can do what she wants because we know kevin has been doing him...if she wants to let the world know her side she can lord knows he has let everyone know his side...foh
She's so trashy and tacky. How do you have Kevin on the show and then put a story out there about the man cheating on his pregnant wife? No class or life of her own. Please like this hate themselves and wish they be someone else. Looking like a transgender Barbie. She's a horrible person
That's a lie. The lawyer said she wouldn't take the test. Get you facts straight. Go look at their press conference. You may be put in the situation. Tori's interview was done last month because of the Instagram post. It states that in tori page and the inside edition, she was responding to that mess. Again, tori said she'll use the press at her do her. Who does you fact checking? All wrong. No wonder no one likes you.
Damn, Black China better watch her back, fr fr.

Pulease...Puffy said great things about J-Lo, and the other one he was with for years...nothing new here folks.
Did everyone forget that his CURRENT wife is the SIDE CHICK he was with BEFORE he divorced his FIRST WIFE?  Don't forget what you DO, will be done to you. Leopards don't change their spots; Tigers don't change their stripes and Cheaters won't stop cheating, especially if they marry their side chicks.  In that case, they will have side chicks on their side chick/wife.  Kevin Hart will NOT change; he is an INSECURE man in a wonderful situation:  money, fame, talent.  Women of a certain situation will ALWAYS give him what he wants...... He really doesn't NEED to be married; he isn't good at it.  He needs to be perpetually single and consider marriage when he's 46 or 50!  That's the truth and a lesson it's going to cost him a lot to learn.  My girl, is going to have this baby and stay with Hart maybe another two years and COLLECT that check in the divorce!  As a former side chick, even though you're his wife, he DOES NOT respect her!
yaaaassss so glad u spoke about Mariah! her performance was dreadful! only heightens my suspicions of alcoholism
What is it with black men and not being able to commit? Well, its the problem with men in general no matter what race or creed.
Wendy looks very different.... Yikes, did she get work done on her face?
I love checking out the hot topics on wendy here. The number one reason is, someone in the comments always posts the minute to get to the tea i clicked to see.
she looks like a man
Money changes you?! Nah. It just exposes your true self by potentializing what you really are. Money and fame give you liberty to do what you want.
He should have never stepped out on his wife, he stated that he contributed to the divorce from his first wife was an affair, why do you do it again!
He gave HT to much money
So you go on TV to talk about someone else's personal affairs and there's an audience listening and actually clapping? I don't get it.
I swear I Searched Whats wrong with Mariah Carey allllllllllll night long after that appearance.
I had to really look. I thought this was yesterday's show cause the dresses look very similar
No... Tori wasn't wrong. She did this interview weeks before Kevin's second cheating video came out, but the media played the video just days after his alleged cheating/extortion came out to make it look like she was speaking on the current issue. Tori was speaking on the post ekino made on her Instagram wedding photo with 8yrs down a lifetime to go and talking about Tori in that post. So then Tori made a comment on her post. That's what Tori is referring to in the interview. She never referred or speaking on either of Kevin's recent cheating incidents with the girl in the car or the sext tape extortion one.
One ho talking about another.
The shade of that Mariah Carey segue literally killed me! ....I'm still gagging
Are women that thirsty for money geeez get  a job instead a being a groupie hoe!!!
Torrei does NOT owe Kevin ANYTHING!!!! NOT allegiance, loyalty etc if she wants to go on all the shows in America she can. Please!!!! Smh
She’s so gossipy! Love her
Wendy says that the first wife should just stay quiet, take the money, and laugh in the corner, that's so bias. Kevin makes jokes about about her, he laughs at her and about her to the whole world. But Wendy says that this girl who was wrong should stay quiet and not express what happened to her? Stupid.\n\nAlso, her saying if you're going to cheat, do it properly is sooooo messed up. Wow.
Mariah needs to give it up.  If Janet Jackson and Madonna can still put on good shows, what's wrong with Mariah?
The first wife held him down before he became famous and then after he became famous he dropped her..karma!! Lol
Wendy you would know.......U ARE REALLY A SICK WOMAN, YOU TRY TO POST YOUR PARENTS LIKE TWO OLD JEWS......GIRL U SICK!!
$20,000 a month for a child Chyna didn't even want, other to get her claws in to the Kardashian money. $1.1 million something dollars for pictures of her, when she was showing her puss for pennies on the dollar for a living. That is pathetic. And btw, Mariah Carey has never been known to be a dancer .  She is a singer. She may have fallen off a bit since the mid 2000's, but when you sing professionally for 30+ years, she's already put her time in.
HAHAHAHA does Wendy know what a chamber maid is? It's sexy Wendy? Way back, they used to use the bathroom in a chamber pot in the middle of the night instead of going outside. So chamber maids changed those pots. haha Sooo sexy
I am so glad Wendy remembered to say her most famous SLOGAN - I noticed she didn't say it on premier day / season 9
I think the news now should be a black man that does not cheat. 🙄🙄
so she just has a show so she can voice her irrelevant opinion?
Hmm...I disagree with Wendy about Torrei. His current wife said some stuff on SM, that did not need to be said.
WHERE IS THE SEX TAPE. SITTING IN A CAR ISNT CHEATING.
I'm sorry, generally I don't speak about celebrity gossip, because  generally no one knows the real truth, but facts are, Torrei Hart went on that show before the cheating scandal even came out, hence the fact that when asked if he would ever cheat again, she said I don't know. 2nd Torrei Hart has delt with all this bs like lady. She wasn't coming for anyone, until they came for her. And I like Wendy, but how the heck can the women who has made her life off of elaborating on other people's business, with a straight face tell this woman that she is wrong for using this opportunity to build her own brand, especially when that ninja has made so much money off of dragging her and their marriage in his comedy skits. So it's ok for him to profit off her pain, but it's not ok for her to do the same. Girl, Bye... Torrei Hart is a beautiful and super intelligent women and deserved so much more than Kevin gave her. It's no way should another women, black women at that, be telling her to just humbly sit back and collect an alimony check, like she some simple minded broad out here just being thirsty for attention. It's her story too and she deserves to be heard just as much as him. I'm not saying she didn't play a role in the demise of their marriage, but no one deserves to be cheated on, abandoned for the other person, and then publicly humiliated constantly. Yet she still maintained her composure. She should be uplifted and admired, not given all this slack that she getting.  She deserves better than that.
Nooooo Kevin made millions in his comedy show after he and Torei divorce and those kids were very small...Torei had every right because his sales will crumble and the kids lifestyle could be in jeporady!
i like the show and what she does but she looks awful for tv im sorry
Like how's she even smile with that much botox and silicone all in her face like that?
Torri did the interview waay before their scandal. Wendy wasn't saying anything when he humiliated her using him cheating in his comedy show. Wendy didn't say anything when she had to deal with people saying that he has upgraded.
Why is Tori the only woman in the world that needs to shut up? She was the financial provider for her family for years before Kevin blew up. She helped co-write his jokes, she financially supported him, took care of his children, and encouraged him to chase his dream. Tori hasn't said anything about Kevin and his current wife for 6 years. She was asked a question during an interview and she gave a level-headed response. Yet Kevin and his wife can constantly bring her up as much as they want? Kevin is constantly clowning Tori and her character in tv shows and in his stand up. If anyone hasn't moved on its Kevin and his new wife.  Besides Wendy is always dragging women on her show to talk about how they've been cheated on, She just brought Tiny on the show to give her Side of the story, but Tori needs to shut up?
I feel sorry for celebs becasue their personal life is not safe nor private.
Has Wendy had a sex job?  \nHonestly peoples allow the emotionalism.
Looks like Kevin Hart is a serial cheater! Short-man syndrome or not, he should not be making babies!!
Men just cheat far more than women and they thinks it's okay for them to cheat soon as a woman cheat she's a whore what are these men.undercover male prostitutes
Wendy is boss. Love ❤️ her
Mariah was horrible!!!
Wendy's ugly
So weve learnt kevin hart is a cheating meat sack and blac chyna is a stereotypical gold diggin whore.
$420.000... lol She's refering to weed. 420 lmao
Omg soooo glad she's back!!!!
What a rack
Blacchyna 🐴🤡🦍🐍🗑💩
Blac chyna momma do to damn much 🤦🏽‍♀️
Diamond and zari
Yuck
wENDY'S HAIR THOUGH. wow
Why dafuq is this trending
she haven't learned.
Wendy breasts are false #plastic
Is webdy a tyranny?
WENDY LOOKS SO GOOD
Chyna is a hoe!!!!
Is Wendy trans?
Auntie Wendy is looking real good
Skrtttttt ✋. Wendy imma need you and your team to get you facts straight before you go talking about folks. Tori went on E after k harts new wife went running her mouth on Instagram about tori and digging up the past when they had all moved on. They just so happened to air it during his scandal with the lil thot..... Y'all need to subscribe to lovelyti to get the real scoop on things 👌
What an odd looking human
This show exists for the enjoyment of men to make a mockery of black women. I hope people understand that.
Wendy's staff needs to get on it with Hot Topics. How can you ask if Da Brat and Mariah are still close? Look on social media! Plus, Da Brat collaborated with Mariah on Hip Hop Honors 90's Game Changers. I love you dearly and love the show, but do your homework. \n\nLastly Mariah. She slayed that performance. I'm sure she didn't dance for the cyber bullying she endured online after a performance of Honey went viral for her not executing the choreography as well vs the music video. But on a positive note she was honored that night so no need for the harsh criticism. \n\nHer last reality show was great for what it was and just like Glitter it just ended up turning into something she never intended. They focused on drama bts with the band and dancers instead of what MC wanted which was the music. That said, I believe this new reality show will try again to focus on the music which is why I think she decided to go with VH1 over E! this time. \n\nHer Tour will be amazing. I just saw her in Miami with Lionel and attended her After Party at The Sugar Factory. And this Tour will be in celebration of your favorite album of her the Butterfly album.
wendy looks like the fish off of shark tale
Please subscribe to my vlog. I am trying to start up a channel
NOTHING BUT KARMA to his current wife for revealing that she too was once his mistress for 2 years at least by her own account while Kevin was still married to his first wife Torrei Hart. I hope his current wife didn't actually believe for one second that he wouldn't do the same to her. How foolish she looks now...
She's really pushing the What in the [insert any subject here] is goin on!? line. Thought it was a cute turn of phrase but now she uses it every 2 sentences and it lost its luster. She trying to come up with a new catch phrase?
Amen to the staying STUCK on STUPID statement.  Just dumb!
Um no she's doesn't have to stay tf quite Wendy shaddup please because his new wife didn't stay quiet bragging about how long they been together 🖕🏽
This is such a fucking weird tv show
Columbia University students get the empire state building lit them! OOh ooh... and New York University grads!
Kevin Hart Bougie now 😂😂 he don't mess with black women (women his color) mixed dont count
11:20\n\nWendy: cheating isn't right but DAMN IT, if you're gonna do it, do it properly\nCrowd: *silence*
About mariah thoooo i mean im a huge fan so maybe a little biased but she has never been about dancing or the performance of it all. it always been about singing and the voice and here and there have a little jig or two but she has never been a dancer and yall always tryna kick a girl when shes down. my homegirl almost 50 she aint gunna be like she was when she was 20 even 30 and now  she has dem babies so maybe yall should lay off
After all these years, Mariah never learned how to dance
Why should the ex-wife be quiet. He should have been thinking about his kids. She did nothing wrong.
i can't stand wendy!
the sauce is here www.blackrepublic.co
Still Jealous of Mariah, I see. Your talking badly about Mariah makes her more relevant and gives here a Halo effect and makes here actually seem sweeter. Makes her more relevant makes you seem insecure.
She looks like she is on drugs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fti0_LYYFfc
how you doing?
How you doin
Love u Wendy..
Wendy girl you look amazing!!!!!
wow her mom looks great!

Chicks gossip assembly show, typical girls style show
YOU'RE MY NUMBER ONE GIRL CRUSH TOO! Xx
You look absolutely stunning in that gorgeous Alice+Olivia dress ❤️
Awww you are so sweet xx  Loved meeting you both and real talking about home births and YouTube stories :)
Serial commenting (sorry, did yesterday too!) But it's so refreshing to see how supportive you are of the girls you met.  You and Anna are so blooming lovely, could imagine having a good natter with you both over cocktails!
Such an amazing trip with Bobbi Brown and meeting some amazing people.  Her lipsticks look so beautiful.  Your Alice-Olivia dress is gorgeous.  Love NY and seeing it through your eyes make me love it even more.  Thanks for sharing your trip with us.     #crushingonyouandAnna
Eva is the daughter of Susan Sarandon, besides being chic, cool and classy 😉
I wanted to say that your video is awesome and I love everything you do. Also, for all the people who reads this, Mexico needs your help. Yesterday occurred a disaster that affected places such as Mexico City and Morelos. Institutions like Cruz Roja Mexicana is helping those people who are in need. Please donate whatever you like or try to help people. Mexico needs your help. #FuerzaMéxico #Méxicoestádepie
Lily... YOU HAVE TO STOP with the whole '...I'm not as cool them'... because you are! You are so cool and unique and so beautiful! :)
3 day trip to NY, cashmere sweaters, books, cookery classes and other expensive gifts just for a lipstick. A lipstick.  Isn't it all a bit vulgar? I understand your job is going on these trips to promote a product but it makes me think less of Bobbi Brown as a company and I wouldn't purchase their products.  \nMaybe I should direct this at Bobbi Brown and not you but incase they are reading....
The quality of your vlogs just keeps getting better, Lily!
You are the awesomest! so I really really really hope you don't mind me mentioning this, it's just a New Yorker thing: the Brooklyn Bridge WAS in one of your shots - and it was for sure super-close - but as I think you probably know, that thing you pointed the camera at when you said you were at the Brooklyn Bridge...wasn't. I mean - you could see it, I'm sure, but we just saw a totally different bridge. (The one the neighborhood is named after.) But anyways...sorry! carry on! fab vlog as always :) I'm always psyched when you guys visit...
So nice to see that you met Jasmin. Love her. What a beautiful vlog :)
Cheers Lily!  Your day in Brooklyn is my next date day with my hubbie!  You need to grab the new East River NYCferry next time you are here.  $2.75 a trip and great way to see the city.
Loooooove this vlog Lily! can't wait to check the lipsticks out!
Lily sitting down on the floor at the start of this vlog reminds me of her old videos 😊
Love the music in this one, Lily! xx
I was in Dumbo just last week by the bridge and carousel and it truly was gorgeous...and peaceful! What a dream trip and the candy floss matches your Alice + Olivia dress 💕
What a seriously enjoyable vlog to watch, such a great mix of clips and the 'AD' part was well integrated and natural. Anyone that has followed you for a while known your love for Bobbi Brown and that makes it even more genuine. Adore the Alice and Olivia dress!! x
I loved this vlog so much! NYC is my favourite, and it was so nice seeing women supporting women 🤗 looked like a super fun trip!
Lily, love the way you do Ad's! I dont even habe the feeling you are doing any Ad's bäm in your face 😊😘
Well, I was girl crushing on both you and Anna the entire vlog! X

Yes Lily, it's Ganni like you said it, at least that's how we pronounce it here in Denmark. It's a Danish family-owned brand ;-)
Love watching yours and Anna's trips together! I think my fantasy New York to-do list is just yours and Anna's recs!
This is such a lovely video and inspiring in a way. The theme behind the brand is amazing and the fact that it leans towards empowering women and encouraging us to find other women to admire is a beautiful thing. I hope to hear more about the lipsticks, maybe you can do an updated video for fall lipsticks or moisturising lipsticks since going towards winter our lips get more drying, at least mine do. It becomes almost impossible for me to wear matte lipsticks, it looks like my lips are falling apart and I tried so many chapsticks, now I settled for Burt's Bees, the vanilla flavoured one and it's pretty good if anybody has dry lips.
Jane's carousel! I'm sure it's the oldest in the world or something similar! I got a tattoo of it to remind me of my fave city.
This is such a great vlog Lily, the ad content is tastefully done and I loved that dress on you!
Oh that dress is worth the splurge <3 Loved this vlog !!
The editing on this was so goooood! And the music choices too! 💕
So cool Jenna Lyons was there! I love Cat Bird, just got my wedding band from them ❤
Awesome VLog Lily...love it!!!
Beautiful vlog :D
Awesome topic for a trip!
Loved this video!
OMG loved this vlog!! (You didn't seriously cut your pasta with a fork and knife?! Italian viewer here 🙋🏽lol). Apart from that, it was lovely!
Geneva, from A Pair and A Spare was one of the first fashion blogs I read. Her DIYs are awesome and she has great style.
Hi Lily! Love the video! It was really wonderful to meet you on that lovely De Maria evening. I was wondering if you could give me credit for the illustrations. My handle is @pauline_de_roussy_de_sales \nThank you!\nBe Well\nxo\nPauline
So the Brooklyn bridge is the brown one that you briefly shot on the left. The one you are in front of for most of the time is the Manhattan bridge.
Just a heads up about your dress! I have the same A+O dress and the fabric is gorgeous but so delicate. I unfortunately had to exchange my first dress because it started to shred around the arm hole/fray. It's beautiful  but I don't want you to have the same issue I did!
i loveeeeeee geneva, she's so talented and she lives in hong kongggg!
Wait? Did you really just cut a noodle? Anyone else do that?
I really really enjoyed watching this vlog and the music you chose. Well done!
You and Anna are my girl crush!!!  💕💕.  I just love your  vlogs you look so beautiful! 💖
What shoes did you wear with Alice and Olivia dress?
Jenna Lyons is def one of my girl crushes.
i really love the new way of editing the videos ❤️❤️ xx Keep it up loved it xx
AWW i love your looks here also, shipping the lily-anna friendship ALWAYS <3
I love this dress on you, please continue to wear it haha! And this trip looked so much fun, especially the meeting Jenna Lyons part
You, Anna, and Eva are my 3 favorite bloggers/youtubers! So glad to see you combined :)
You and Anna have the cutest friendship, I need a friend like that lol
Brooklyn Bridge is the brown one, the blue metal one is the Manhattan Bridge. x
Lovely vlog Lily! :-)\nImmediately knew I had seen that Carousel before in Glee - Lols :-D Here is the clip https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb9DGhpxnN0
Definitely want to check out Lilia! Looks so good!
Loved this, Lily! PS All the illustrations got me wondering if you've kept up with your calligraphy...
I'm not a lipstick girl but these sound amazing. I'd actually try them.
 You are one of my favorite bloggers and as an amateur musical theatre actress NYC is one of  my favorite cities. Thanks for sharing your time here with sweet Anna
what is the name of the first song? x
You and anna have such a beautiful friendship ❤️❤️❤️❤️ love you both!!!
You two are my girl crush! Love both of you! xox
I love Anna's hair up like that
Lovely lip colours, but really loving the sparkly candy floss...so hungry right now....Sugarrrrrrr!
Love your NY vlogs & Love seeing you and Anna together! www.byharrison.com
makes me really want to go to NY :)
Really enjoyed this vlog, it looked like you girls had such a good time. Your Alice + Olivia dress is so gorgeous!
I love that they gave their balloons to the kids😊
I've been waiting, watching this with my dinner.
You are amazing lily ❤️❤️❤️
I spy Jenna Lyons! 😍
Where are the lipstick lids😮😮😮
Love NY and love you girls, can't get better than that...
Ahahahaha pasta baby. Bloody love Anna 😂😂
love,love this episode...
Loved this vlog Lily! Xx
That cookbook looks lush. Really loved this vlog, Lily. I love how your channel is really evolving and changing right now. X
Oh coooool! I totally understand that you loved @madametamtam. She is definitely one of my favorite German YouTubers. Such a stunning lady!
New York is my dream!!! You are so lucky!!! But Lily please don't cut pasta!!! ahahaha xoxo from Italy
Such a beautiful vlog! I'm really loving your content lately lily 💓

So wonderful seeing you so happy!! Love when you & Anna are together! Great video!
Loving the longer hair! Please keep growing it 😍❤️
one of my favourite vlogs so far 😻💛 you and Anna look so relaxed and happy! xxx
Anna didn't have her red lip on
Wow such a colorful and inspirational video. I love it!
You have excellent taste in girl crushes - Eva is Eva Amurri, Susan Sarandon's daughter.  💙d her since I saw her in Saved!
I'm going to New York for the first time in February, does anyone have an recommendations touristy or not I'd really love to hear them x
Awwww I just love your vlogs lily ❤️😘
Fantastic vlog. 😁
What a lovely, lovely vlog.
The editing on this was so goooood! And the music choices too! 💕
It`so weird, that Bobbi Brown is now without Bobbi herself!  But they tell stories about her girl crushes. I think she left her own brand not for a good reason.\nSuch a nice trip any way and nice vlog, like always, Lily!
Jasmin is one of my favorite German youtubers 😍
Wow Lily, you are truly blessed to have met the infamous Bobbi Brown. She was the very first high end beauty products that I started at the age of 18. I had purchased some of her beauty books growing up and she has always been an inspiration to me. And for you to be in her presence with her and her is such an honor. I really wish I was able to meet her. I actually live in NYC😊
Lovely vlog! I like Anna and you so much :)
Loved it! Vlog queen!
wait,the bridge Lily mentions at 5.18 is manhattan bridge not brooklyn bridge right??
OMGGGG I've been waiting for this video all day!! Haha I love watching your vlogs 😉
Lily, I probably missed you saying when the lipsticks are gonna launching. But can u let me know when it's launching. Thanks dear xx

I feel like this wasn't just a diary of your holiday outfits but a diary of you getting more and more tan throughout the week! Looked very lovely and I loved all of your outfits! Glad you had fun :)
Those crazy colourful sandals are from a Greek brand!  Yeah
Skincare routine please?!
It's quite annoying how Zoe can literally pull anything off 😍😂
This takes me back to the 2012 Zoella 😂
How do you get the perfect tan on holiday! I never tan :( ?
I just returned from Greece and I hoped so much you will upload it before I leave 😭
I really really really don't want to sound creepy but I wish I knew what brand Zoe's bras are just because I wish I had that kind of support! I mean the bras really make her bust look good, but that's a weird compliment to make. If somebody knows, help? Sorry for the weird comment

I miss Zoe's discopants
19:50 your hair and sunglasses remind me soooo much of Amber Davies from Love Island! Anyone else😂
Zoe! Idk if you will see this but for the red dress, maybe you can tie the sleeves around you or around your neck it would work?? You're pretty creative :) just an idea :) hopefully that makes you like it more
Only Zoe could make an outfit diary 31 minutes long 😂😂💓

31 mins of Zoe? HELL YEAH! Omgosh I’ve been waitinggggg 😍
What country did u go to
The Lionesses top their group after matchday 1.
Too easy.
Is it me or do the English lady's play better than the men. Well done girls
Amazing Fran Kirby
So sorry to see Mark Sampson leave England Women's Team - THANK YOU for some amazing results and progress in Women's Football. My wife and I have REALLY enjoyed supporting and following the England Lionesses and their tremendous progress.
02:00 best of the lot.\n#Bronze
Everything about that first celebration is just wrong... They show unity but what about Eni Alike uhh ? Unity in keeping the starting spots.
Why is this trending?
Tranmere rovers!!!!!

i mean its all nice but imagine Bailly and Rojo charging at them. The whole team would have to be stretchered off
Like to see a game with the usa team.
Man Toni Duggan is a babe and good player too 😍☺️
Then hours later he was sacked
Why is this trending with only 7k views,
Ladies love to play with balls more than men 😂😂
*BLYAT*
Reported for violent content
Great Lioness and beating Russia is great.
Toni Duggan is such a great player
Now Sampson is set to leave as manager haha
Manager Sacked.
Pity it’s the women
Check out www.makeplates.co.uk for car show/legal plates :)
Preston park tranmere rover ground was empty and it was shocking game and under 12 boy team would wipe floor with russia and england team is crap defence with goalkeeper was comedy show.
Hi everyone can you subscribe to my channel please watch my little boy doing football training thank you
Good job, Mini Messi! Fantastic assists tonight.
Wow, finally Duggan scores and she's labelled a good player.She's an Heskey. She chokes a lot.Good game.
Then they go and sack the manager, what the hell..
Great performance by the girls. Cracking start to the campaign. Well done everybody involved.
Can't believe the fa sacked mark Sampson all because he dropped 1 player who didn't like it he was cleared twice of any wrong doing from 2 different investigations no other players are saying he did it England just got rid of the second most successful England  manager so good job
First
School girl level of skill
No such thing as England lioness bunch of Dykes
Mark Sampson is such a great manager.\n\n\nOh wait...
The women are better than men 👍
stop playing football
0:10 Goal! Let's do one thing to secure our career, nothing is more important than our career *Everyone celebrated with sampson\n0:29 Sampson: that will do it, players support me, the world will think i'm innocent
who even watches this?
Women football shout be banned
Why is this on trending. O I know libtube.
1:33 what a miss!
Women football is rubbish and can put on level professional men's. Because men's game a lot hard and wrong than woman football.
Good riddance Mark Sampson you racist scumbag
kirby should have gotten man of the match for that amazing performance. but they all played brilliantly so understandable that the commentators had a hard time choosing
So SD gets Hiac this year and Raw gets No Mercy , Raw gets Tlc and SD Roadblock?
Just shame Shane can't call on the devils favourite demon the big red monster Kane to help out just a little lol
i like you Shane and i hope u do! i just can't  stand ko.
Don't cross the boss!
I'm hoping this feud builds to a Daniel Bryan return... Like, Shane loses, KO continues to beat him, DB comes in to rescue, build tension for a few months as KO becomes world champion again, then DB comes back at the Royal Rumble and wins it, leading to Daniel Bryan vs. Kevin Owens at Wrestlemania.\n\nThat is, of course, if the rumors of him trying to rehab is true.
0:16 \n\nHow would that make you feel?\n\nKevin: I fe---\n\nIt doesn't matter what makes you feel.
Anyone think this could MAYBE lead to HHH v. Owens down the line?
Never mess with a McMahon, never turns out well for you.
Shane DESTROY him
Stone cold Kevin Owens
I can't wait...but knowing the current WWE, this match won't be all that great
Isn't it crazy that Shane has 3 sons and Stephanie has 3 daughters
They had Kevin Owens never even come out?
Smackdown is so wack compared to raw
You know the show is bad when the only way to get good ratings is to have the boss fight
What about all those times Austin and Rock beat up the McMahons?
Calling it now.. triple H will come out and pedigree Shane
I love shane but owens wins 😥
If Owens wins, I stop watching.
This match better be good if  not this storyline is trash.
What is Shane looking at?? There are no people in the sections of the arena he is looking at
a cell shane, a cell
They do this so Shane can jump off stuff
Shane has 3 sons\nStephanie has 3 daughters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jJ47Oee3ag
Good promo by Shane. I hope he colors up KO in Hell in the Cell.
It was good to see Shane McMahon live. I was there last night. He didn't greet the city of Oakland CA that just shows he's serious now. I can't wait for Hell In A Cell
I want to Dean Ambrose or Roman regins or Seth Rollins to fight  Shane McMahon
No Mercy on my birthday :D
Shane is too damn old for this
It's so rare that I see the crowd go silent.
They could make this way more exciting
Let Triple H do it he would beat the hell out of Kevin Owens
Undertaker pulls Shane down under the ring, Shane is gone for a few weeks with the lights going out every time Owens has a match and next ppv the corporate ministry makes its return.
Shane McMahon Vs Kevin Owens At No Mercy Do IT
It's called wwe Shane, The word wrestling is in wwe. If you didn't want your kids to see it why you let them when they already knew the script duhh
When Shane said he was going to Dem him did he mean dm
Shane gotta be one of the best guys in wwe right now\nHe always puts on a fight with great wrestlers and do an incredible job on thoose matches
Lost to undertaker lost to AJ styles y'all think about this
Tell Shane to take a trashcan, baseball bat
lameeeeee... \n\nvince should have build this more up
>Shane promises to take Owens to hell\nYou said that about taker and look what happen
Am i the only one who got chills throughout all the time Shane was talking?Like,you can see it right in his eyes that he's not joking anymore..
Didn't he himself order people to beat down McMahon on multiple times?
Oh NOW !!! Shane decides : daddy i love now because someone attacked you and i have to care about you now ,and your going to see jump off a cell again and pretand that we have a father -son bond😌😭 .........hhhhhh dude last year you said that you wished that your not his son and you said that you are ashamed
Now I think the only think left is Chris Jericho if he returns on hell in a cell I would be so excited for the smackdown after hell in a cell I am missing Jericho and his list
how much u wanna bet shane jumps of HITC
McMahon's will strike out with massive vengeance! Ha lol you definitely do! Look what you guys did to CM punk
Who threw a pie in Kevin Owens face .....
Anyone ever thought of a KO vs HHH possibility if Shane was still suspended?
Shane was totally Jules in this segment! he's gonna murder Owens....
Come on Shane you can do it you can beat kevin\nDo it for your fans and for machman family
I though he did not like vince
Shane should bring kane back to destroy Owens
This storyline getting deserving heat\nI'm lovin it\nBay Bay
I think Chris jerrico join with Shane or triple h
That was a speechless speech my boy !
No offence Shane, but why couldn't you do anything to Stone Cold Steve Austin when he used to beat up your dad in a regular basis all those years.
Shane took an f5 from Brock and let that go but soon as aj styles or Owens do something he want to fight. What a hypercrite
Vince and Shane vs Kevin Owens WM 47 confirmed
Jump off the cell Shane
I'm calling it now: Kevin Owens is going to face Shane McMahon, and Vince is going to screw him over and align with Kevin Owens - BOOK IT VINCE because that is best for business $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Now finally Smackdown can sell as many tickets as RAW.
I can see shane winning the MR MCMAHON comes down with a chair beating
Kevin Owens is going to serve mr and mrs mcMahon chili to Shane.
Who the hell is Shane McMahon ?!!! What is the infatuation with this glorified stunt man. Daddy's boy ! No talent whatsoever ! No wrestling skills no mic skills . All he has is no fear and thats it ! We all know at some point in this match he will climb the structure and jump or fall  off  onto a table or in the ring. Take your pick . no wonder wwe ratings keep suffering.
People please watch my videos and suscribe and i will suscribe back
I can't believe people want Shane to win smh. I mean he's a great guy but come on! It's Kevin Owens for Christ sake.
When you mess with the McMahon family you will pay the price
_My kids witnessed their grandfather getting beat down in the middle of this ring_\n\nGosh, Shane, I'd have thought they'd have been used to that by now!
But is his suspension lifted?
imagine if the undertaker had the same physique he had back in 1999 now and he attacked vince i wonder what shane would do then.
Did you know how to grow your youtube channel watch this video\nhttps://youtu.be/yJIyWRl69kQ
Shane of house mcmahon, is tyrian of house lanister
Vince dont make shane lose
Gg
Shane don't kill yourself agian
Hopefully Shane will win
Well done
0:17 crowd: it doesnt matter!
I'll kill Kevin Owens
DO IT
Awful...Just awful...
i hope  Kevin Owens kills Shane McMahon

Just do it!
Easy
Keven Owens is in trouble
I got a ticket for the Friday concert at the Bowl.  I can hardly wait.  The sound is always really good at that venue so there's really no BAD seat other than closeness to the stage.  I'm somewhere in the middle.
didnt like it at first, few days later cant stop listening to it.
This isn't very good
This is lit!!!! Thank u Moz
Sounds like it came out of Kill Uncle very good,  can't wait to see  MOZ @ the Hollywood Bowl
Sounds very much like McCartney's Mr Bellamy, the verses anyway. I like it, witty as ever
Trust Morrissey to sum up the truth, the media \nand the ordinary persons hunger for freedom and discontent with unchecked capitalism.\nThank god he's still with us sharing these kind of lyrics.  \nX❤
bloody hell, how I missed you, Dear Morrissey. (Chile waits for you as usual)
A return to form for Morrissey - sound advice too.
this is straight trash 😕😕😕
keep winding the feeble minded up morrissey. a true comment on modern society .
Does anyone know where I could get tabs for this? Want to try to convert it to a guitar based song. I think it would be fun to try to make it guitar sounding. 👍🏻 Thanks
Another Masterpiece from an Absolute Legend! Follow him on Twitter:  #OfficialMoz #Morrissey 
Love you Morrissey, but you lost it.\nYou're not JOHNNY FUCKING MARR.\n😎
This guys lyrics sound like a 4 year old
As I listened to this for the first time I was genuinely sat in my bed and trying to forget about all my responsibilities for the day. Morrissey gets it.
I love this. I wish the millennial generation can appreciate this
Trying to find the motivation to get up and hear that song x) Well I love it especially the lyrics but I can't stop thinking it's a sign^^'
Had a few listens now it's really good he delivers his lyrics in such a unique way
To the tune of girlfriend in a coma......im a racist has been you youngsters will have never seen my videos...so 20 years later this is how it goes.  Release a turd of a song and it wont be long before your in a coma  in your homa you will hide trying to commit suicide ...altogether niw morrisey in a coma i know its really nice..

Another masterpiece. Tank you Moz...waiting for a live session in Italy...or near...
great lyrics as always
First impressions: so happy to hear him ditching the screechy arena guitars. Voice in lovely form, even if as some contend it's digitally juiced. The lyrics feel like a continuation of the sloganeering in World Peace. I happen to agree with the statements, but I find them artlessly expressed. He was full of poetry, once. \n\nCautiously awaiting the rest.
Is it just me, or does it look like Morrissey has had some botox done?  I'm mainly referring to how he looks in the Germaine Greer England Is Theirs t-shirt pic.  I hope it's just the lighting or something, because IMHO he didn't need botox.  He had (and hopefully still has) an iconic look.
The kid on the cover looks like Johnny Thunders.
I just love it! Thank you Morrissey!!
The greatest is back! Looking forward to him touring this album
I'm not my type\n\n😆
Not great. Sounds lke the theme tune to Sorry starring Ronnie Corbett.
Going through a very low period right now, however, it's quite an ardent comfort to know that the voice from my childhood is still not only producing work, but he seems to have a renewed vigor. That voice. That familiar old voice.
viva le morrissey, im a slave to the grind but...i like the money....
Get this man a prescription thug! Or better still a conscription thug!!
so after the first few lines he's sounding like 85!
Moz's voice is NEVER changed! What a great.. I feel like cry.. cos  the back of him with poetic lyrics, the charming  low tone voice...
Think this song was written for me lol :P
No imascuyllation no castration this is deep. Never get institutionalised by work. We work to live not live to work.
I hope Alain comes back. Lets face it, since Alain left, the music got immensely mediocre at best. Boz is a hit and miss (more miss than hits unfortunately) amidst the friction and the competition for songwriting it is obvious they need Alain. This is just my opinion, no need to freak out.
Don't get crumbs on the sheets
Morrissey... helping to break the wicked spell they cast
i used already to stay in bed ............ don't feel ashamed but FREE ....................
Can Fall out Boy please be pushed into a river of diarrhea already?
This IS good. Will be adding to my channel : )
Great to have you back, Moz!
Time, do as I wish....no working for the man 🖕
Genius I love it
I had heard a lot of people who really didn't like this at all or took ages to get to like it. I loved this first listen. Been singing it all day at work
I like the instrumental...
The News contrives to frighten you🦇 The REAL twilight zone🦇☝️🥀
I love it and I love Mozz.
I can't stop listening this song  WTF
On 17th November i will spend the day in bed and listen to the new Morrissey album.
I'm a bit in love with this
Excited to hear the new album!
I recommend that you stop paying your licence fee...
0:00 Please be good, please be good, please be good.\n\nEdit: 3:30, it's good.
Amazing song! There s a lot of The Smiths going on in this tune.
Love it. Can't stop listening.
In love with it! <3
I actually spent the day in bed , I don't have a job currently, why should I be hated , Viva Moz
Should've been, Spent the day laying on a mattress of money
Loving the cheery organ. Nice juxtaposition to his sultry tones. And the vocal melody is a bit less predictable than usual (soz, Moz - true though ;) ) I want to keep playing it - feels as singalongable as anything from Bona Drag. Yey! Conclusion: I LOVE IT. He's back!
Love you Morrissey xx
Μέγας Morrissey!

Morrissey regresa con las pilas cargadas y con muy mala baba. La portada es ya una provocación, pero en el nuevo disco carga contra figuras políticas, cuestionando la autoridad y disparando contra las mentes bienpensantes. Algunos de los títulos del nuevo álbum nos dejan claras sus intenciones:\nIsrael, Who Will Protect Us From the Police? y The Girl from Tel-Aviv Who Wouldn’t Kneel.\nEl ex-vocalista de The Smiths ya publicó en 2013 una autobiografía incendiaria que resultó un éxito de ventas y 2014 reveló que se había sometido hasta en cuatro ocasiones a distintos tratamientos para luchar contra el cáncer.\nEl artista británico estrena el primer single Spent the day in bed, un tema que nos recuerda al mejor Morrissey. La letra es una oda a la pereza, como antídoto contra los terribles acontecimientos de nuestro tiempo, mientras canta: StopWatching the news, because the news contrives to frighten you. El disco se pondrá a la venta el 17 de noviembre con el título “Low In High School” Es el primer material del artista en tres años, desde que en 2014 publicó su último trabajo, World Peace Is None of Your Business. Los doce temas que compondrán el disco han sido grabados en La Fabrique Studios en Saint-Rémy-de-Provence (Francia) y en Forum Studios, los estudios de Ennio Morricone en Roma. El undécimo disco de la carrera de Morrissey ha sido producido por Joe Chiccarelli, quien también ha colaborado con artistas como The Strokes, Beck y The White Stripes.\nMúsica independiente novedades.
Bueno Morrissey, yo te amo, pero qué es esta mierda?!
MOZZA THE FUCKING KING!!
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
Welcome back , Mozz.
Godlike genius
Excelent tune!  Superb as always!!!
Vintage Moz
Exquisite
DEPRESSING YET UPLIFTING AS USUAL!!!! 🎉🎉🎉
Morrissey is a Pupkin!
Morrissey. Morrissey is back.
Murdoch buys twitter and Morrissey wakes up.
The background spanish thooooo
Mozzer strikes again.. good days are coming
Brilliant.
Love it! Brilliant song.
LOVE YOU LOVE YOU LOVE YOU LOVE YOU LOVE YOU LOVE YOU
This is actually amazingggg
Everything is True. 🙂
Awesome
fantastic
ERES EL CAPO MOZ! TE AMO SIEMPRE ❤️!
Fuckin shite. That fat twat needs to retire.
This is awful. His political views have clearly taken priority over his music. Truly disappointing, coming from a longtime fan.
Better than the last album, but talk of staying in bed from someone who probably does alot of his time seems trite
Oh dear. That was awful. My hero too.
Old fart I maybe but Smiths/Morrissey fan I have been since the beginning - this is rubbish. Dare I mention 'Kill Uncle' ..... do many/any of you know what that is?
sooo nice that he is back !! excellent song as always \nI made a cover of this song. I would be glad if you check it out : \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AYHs-Bo9mw&t=0s
go back to fatty mode i like you when ur still meaty
Aww, beautiful. But, he's lost so much weight!
I miss you Sam ❤️❤️
I like the old Sam. Now he looks like a malnutrition. sorry
That creaking sound and the chirping and the wind blowing... 😍 and his voice and the emotion in this vid... it's life..
SMH.. because it never hurts to love tragic people that can't open their heart. I've definitely never experienced that. Let's all feel bad for the person that can't show his/her feelings and not the person who left because they finally realized they weren't a priority. Fuck goodbyes. I'm down with ~Whateverz.
Oh my god sam, i love this song so muchh!!!!!!!
i love you sam smith
No dont make me cry  \nNo don't lose weight \nNo don't say goodbye\nNo don't be sad 😭😭😢😢
His style never changes, he has the style that we love!!!
I really love your voice this is so beautiful sounds.
I'm the toxic one. I'm the one who came back. I was so lonely. I left her because I felt like she was mimicking my entire life. And then I was so lonely. I have nobody. So I was stupid. I said something. I reached out and now I'm in a bad place because she wants me to talk and I know it was a mistake to reach out. I can't talk to her. I was the toxic person. I'm sure I still am. But it's starting to feel like she is. But after reaching out like that I can't cut her off again because that would just be rude. But that's all I want to do. What am I supposed to do. It's all my fault but I just want peace. I just wanted us to be in talking terms. But now she's upset at me for feeling guilty about her and I'm so freaking confused
Too Good At Goodbyes\n\nSam Smith\n\nLyrics\n\nYou must think that I'm stupid\nYou must think that I'm a fool\nYou must think that I'm new to this\nBut I have seen this all before\n\nI'm never gonna let you close to me\nEven though you mean the most to me\n'Cause every time I open up, it hurts\nSo I'm never gonna get too close to you\nEven when I mean the most to you\nIn case you go and leave me in the dirt\n\nBut every time you hurt me, the less that I cry\nAnd every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry\nAnd every time you walk out, the less I love you\nBaby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true\n\nI'm way too good at goodbyes\n(I'm way too good at goodbyes)\nI'm way too good at goodbyes\n(I'm way too good at goodbyes)\n\nI know you're thinking I'm heartless\nI know you're thinking I'm cold\nI'm just protecting my innocence\nI'm just protecting my soul\n\nI'm never gonna let you close to me\nEven though you mean the most to me\n'Cause every time I open up, it hurts\nSo I'm never gonna get too close to you\nEven when I mean the most to you\nIn case you go and leave me in the dirt\n\nBut every time you hurt me, the less that I cry\nAnd every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry\nAnd every time you walk out, the less I love you\nBaby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true\n\nI'm way to good at goodbyes\n(I'm way to good at goodbyes)\nI'm way too good at goodbyes\n(I'm way too good at goodbyes)\nNo way that you'll see me cry\n(No way that you'll see me cry)\nI'm way too good at goodbyes\n(I'm way too good at goodbyes)\n\nNo\nNo, no, no, no, no (I'm way too good at goodbyes)\nNo, no, no, no\nNo, no, no (I'm way too good at goodbyes)\n(No way that you'll see me cry)\n(I'm way too good at goodbyes)\n\n'Cause every time you hurt me, the less that I cry\nAnd every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry\nAnd every time you walk out, the less I love you\nBaby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true\nI'm way too good at goodbyes
im way to good at goodbye's is so relatable this songs makes me tear up every time I listen to this song 👏😿💔👌💯
Did he used to be bigger or something m. Why does he look thinner
OK CRYING AS SOON AS HE HIT THE FIRST NOTE.

First time seeing this song and I am hooked!!!!!! <3 <3
I want to be good at goodbyes 🙂
Someone had shared a cover of this song to me and told me it was Sam Smith but I could figure that she is totally just brainwashed and in love with another artist's vocals
Still like Spectre by Radiohead better
i love you so fuckin much
I'm not used to this Small sam Smith.
Wtf happened with him he looks so different
He looks like Bart from hollyoaks in this 😂

What makes a song great?  What makes it stand out among others? What makes it something more than just catchy, more than just a song that's played to promote the artist?  \nA song that people can relate to, words with meaning a story and a voice and artist that give the song life. Well done Sam Smith well done.
I just notice about his brown sweater. Does it explain about his sick or something else ?
It sad but it's true I way too good at goobye 😂😂😂😂😂

Now, this is what MUSIC really means.

How can I explain my kid that two kissing men is not ok. It's everywhere. I don't know how to sort gay stuff out of my kids sight. I love America but I think it's time for people like me to leave. It's just too much, this place is sick.

ANTI-HOMOPHOBIC NUMBER 1
Awesome!
who is listening in 2015?
It is not scary at all
In Finland everyone sits as quiet as they can
I'm 15 and i didn't get scared well i jumped when Pennywise appear but not that scary
Then the joker walked in..you should see their reaction!
It was not scary
Im 10 And i watched it Its Not Fucking Scary wtf
People that go and watch IT for the horror aspect will be disappointed, the film was more of a coming-of-age movie. It was a very good film.  A better adaptation of the novel than the mini-series way back when.
By me starts the new it movie at 28.9
they got scared because of that random guy running around in the room. not the movie
A fight broke out in the cinema when I watched this
No one does this in a theatre, they may jump as in stay in there seats but have a natural reaction to a jump scare but not scream so loud you can't hear the film when ur next door lol
This movie was so funny bruh
Why the fuck are they screaming? No one did that when I saw it
I mean it was pretty scary, but nothing like this shit. Niggas were screaming and jumping. This is bullshit.
Haha It's good but It's not that terrifying lmfao
This is the one where someone dressed up as pennwise and scared the shit out of people 😂😂
This is why you don't watch it in America
People screamed in the theater when I saw this but not this bad
The old clown (Tim currie) was scarier \nThe new clown is a disaster\nThe  old movie was great \nThe new movie is a flop
BULLSHIT!!! This film is not scary!! People were laughing not screaming in my packed out 200+ cinema
Americans are soo fucking over the top. It isn't even that scary, more like entertainment. Fuck America!
Why they screaming like there is a mass shooting taking place?
Seems they were just scared by staffs... ...
So glad I didn't see the Autistic friendly viewing...
Totally conditional. only that.
It's a sad day when people judge every aspect of a horror movie on how scary it is.
I saw it and it wasn't even scary
i have seen the movie before and i'm a kid\ni got a little creeped out but i didn't fly out my whole seat 😑
IT was not a scary film. This is obviously fake and they were all paid for that performance.
Bunch of pussys. The new movie isn't even scary it's shit.
Probably americans they scream at the smell of shit
wow. I would have left the theater. Not because its scary, but because I get so annoyed by crowds like this. 0:23 Seriously if some idiot in a clown costume tried to scare me, while I was watching a movie I payed to see, I would not punch the guy, I would leave & demand my money back. Call me an angry grandpa or partypooper or whatever, but when I pay for a movie I wanna watch & experience the movie. Not be constantly distracted by children screaming at every. single. thing+ employees in cheap costumes thinking it helps my experience of the movie by being distracted from the movie...\nThat is also the reason why I never go to any premieres of any films, any. Not even star wars. Having extreme neards comming dressed & acting like they are jedi, running around the theater, clashing there plastic swords against eachother. Yelling at every second. Arghhh..\n\nthe IT movie is awesome! saw it a week ago, in a normal theater, with a normal group of people, who got scared a couple of times, but thats fine, hey it is a horror film afterall. Its the over the toppeople I have big problems with. But overall, I got my moneys worth:) looking forward to chapter two:)
Doubt this is real. No one screamed, only laughed when I went.
It wasn't that scary
Change the title to fans reaction in America. Be a a lot different from the one in Britain. Drama queens......
what the hell! the movie was great but not scary!
To the people wondering why they were screaming so much, they had someone walking around as Pennywise, appearing here and there scaring people, thats why you see people looking around and behind them.
It wasnt real enough for you Bill, IM I NOT REAL EnOUGH for you?! IT WAS REAL ENOUGH FOR GEORGIE!!!  PURE GOLD!
Just so all you people know the theater had a clown running around scaring people
This is a fake as female orgasms.
I don't understand, this movie wasn't scary for shit!!
Am I the only one who fucking hates people like this that scream at every part
When he comes out the projector screen 😲
Just had to take my top off cos my shit was too intense
What the fuck?  The film is eerie at times, but never full on scary.  The people in this audience must be scared by anything.
Would be funny if had someone dressed up in a clown costume running around popping the balloons in there
I swear must of the people in these comment sections are dumb saying it wasn't scary why they screaming. You that deaf and blind you don't realise someone dressed up as IT is going round the room doing stuff to make people jump.
You can tell this is fake not just because of the exaggerated relations but the fact that no self respecting person would bring a balloon into the cinema theatre
The theater where I saw the movie had call for an abulance.... Twice!  One woman fainted when she saw Pennywise. And some 30 something year old guy had a panic attack when Georgys arm was bitten off. There were girls screaming.... Guys scarring girls.. teenagers jumping and hollering! Absolutely astonishing.. the children of this nation. ( And some adults)  are going to be the end of all of us!
the movie was more funny than scary
It depends on whose in the audience some scare easy some don't. When I saw the movie some laughs a scream or two but not the reaction I thought there would be. The movie was ok maybe when it's out on Blu-ray or DVD I might see it again.
😒 these people should never watch a horror movie again
The is faker than  pornhub ads telling me there are woman nearby want to fuck me.
I'm glad i didn't go to that theater where they scream there heads off!
It was more funny that it was scary. Richie made it hilarious
Good film. But It wasn't even scary, all this fake unnecessary screaming is annoying
Пугливые какие то америкашки
В русском зале большинство либо никак особо не отреагировали на это,либо даже слегка угарали)))

Check out Mother! or don't, it doesn't matter - Best review ever
Do you get it?
I'm just waiting for the PureFlix knock-off, Father!  Starring Kirk Cameron and Dean Cain.
I guess I'm in the minority here but I liked this film quite a bit. I didn't find the allegory ham-fisted at all and was really interested throughout the film to see where he was going with all of this. I thought the pacing was fantastic. I don't find Aronofsky to be a a pretentious douchbag and think he is a very talented writer/director although I don't like a couple of his films (The Fountain and Noah). I will completely agree however that this movie will not appeal to the majority of mainstream audiences, will most likely not make back its budget and fans of Hunger Games and Silver Linings Playbook will probably be horrified. It think it did go a little overboard in one part (I won't spoil was it was) but it's very well made for what it is.
I loved this film and the artistic chances it takes. It’s super abstract and not meant to be taken seriously. It’s very similar to my short film Meggan’s Journey.
Oh HE made that Video ... let me guess. It's a movie about a mother that failed at becoming a mother and will never be one. All his movies are about the same shit same character different plot punch. My guess is she had a miss-birth, don't tell me I nailed it. Make a new Movie you hack!\nAfter watching: Yap he keeps making the same movie.
18:08 Isn't that the girl from ISHTAR?\n\n\n\n\n3, 2 ,3, 4, 4, 2 ,3 and-
I sent my best friends from high school to The Crying Game on the pretense it was about the IRA and the struggle with England.  One of my favorite pranks in my life.
In 6th grade, I tried writing a short story where there was a royal family of mermaids, and the queen  was very sick, and she represented the pollution and damage done to the oceans. The king and queen had three daughters, and youngest one was very plain, but you would get literally lost in her eyes in a place beyond space and time. Somehow, she was suppose to represent people's efforts to be environmentally friendly, and was the only hope for her mom to get better. I had characters, but no plot.  All I had to do was represent humanity with different characters and use the plot of the bible and boom! Movie.
I look forward to their review of the small horse movie.
this movie sounds fucking hilarious. I'm totally gonna watch it now, I want to see an absolute shitstorm.
Fucking hell Aronofsky, smash us over the fucking head with it, won't ya?!
doughy eyed? Man she's gotta lose that eye weight!
People destroying the earth that PEOPLE have decided is THE earth. The environmental morals of people bear no actual connection to the earth itself. \n\nEarth, how do you feel about all this plastic?\nIt's cool, I have all sorts of multi-million year games I can play with it. Come back in 20 million and I'll show you plastidiamonds.\n\nEarth, how do you feel about runaway carbon emissions?\nIt's cool, I like flipping the atmosphere now and then already.\n\nEarth, how do you feel about nukes?\nThey're cool, not as cool as a super-volcano though. If you guys make it long enough I'll show you one!
22:12 'Mankind bad, ruin earth.' Got it. So should we all kill ourselves?
Well, Dunkirk was shallow as a puddle too and people ate it up in droves, so whatever. I thought mother! was incredible.
Interesting enough my friend thought the movie  was a metaphor for celebrity culture and how people (celebs and social media stars) have a huge disregard for privacy and always have the need to share everything with everyone because of their egos. It shows how we tend to treat celebs like gods and not normal people. The child being passed around and killed was a metaphor for when these very people share every single aspect of their children that they have basically doomed them to a fate in the spotlight that could eventually kill them (also a metaphor for child actors who went off the deep end). JLaw being called a slut, stripped and getting beaten for it harkens back to her photo scandal and how certain people treated and see her differently for it. I truly bought this interpretation from my friend until I watched the director's interview and we FUCKING WASTED OUR TIME THINKING TOO HARD OVER A SHALLOW ASS MOVIE.
Is the Four Seasons honestly the classiest Hotel you could think of?
The movie bombed because of the Trump curse.
The other other white meat!
Lol I love the irony of two schulbs from Milwaukee calling into question someone's worldliness
I've said this before..... IDENTITY WAS A GREAT MOVIE. You guys gotta learn about movies!
Note to audience: Jay and Mike are well versed in stories from the Bible.
Did this take 12 years to make?  I onlya watch films that took 12 years to make.
Fun Fact: Daniel Craig is married to the former wife of a Brooklyn Cab Driver.
A S S  T O  A S S
Why is Ken Foree covered up on the billboard?
Happy The Wrestler is the only Aronofsky movie I've seen in theaters. \nThis sounds like it's his attempt at making his own Holy Mountain and, well, I can't stand Jodorowski
Can you eat fetuses in a good way?
At least it's not a rehash of the past movies and trying something new and different. We complain  when movies are the same and we complain directors try new shit lol
The sarcasm is so real in the beginning
Oooooooooh I get it! It's an allegory for the bible!
As always these guys are halaious, especially the gay one. Great show guys. Seriously the best reviews on the whole interwebs!
I just want J-law to get naked before she gets old and wrinkly is that too much to ask Hollywood?
Mike’s Aronofsky impersonation is the best.
People still think kikes can actually do anything creative?
jay is way more into this movie then mike. ill see you in 30 years for a review. xoxo
Identity is a good movie, fuck you.
Spot on casting for Javier Bardem as God.
His name will echo through the ages
Do a Re:view on all 3 Twin peaks seasons, I'm really curious  to find out your thoughts on the Return.
Jen is a typical girl. Dating a douche and spreading her unnecessary political views.
Lmao was kirsten wigg (the publicist) suppose to represent prophet mohammed? Because a publicist is a lot like a messenger (prophet Mohammed was a messenger)
Creepy smile at 3:52
You guys are the best hack frauds, ever!
This is how the universe balances itself, the shittier a movie is the better it's Half in the bag episode will be.
I perversely enjoyed Noah, because it was taking the stupid weird shit from the bible and doing it straight. Other Aronofsky movies are terrible pretentious bullshit.
Oh wow! So she is a bad actor? Who could've guessed?
Dear Mr Plinket, you can't stop watching movies, but Jay and Mike keep reviewing them. Osmosis? Telepathy?
Oh God, if you compared mother! to IDENTITY, which is THE MOST HATEFUL MOVIE EVER, I definitely don't want to see this waste of film.  Thank you, thank you, RLM!
The Wrestler is a great movie.
I heard an interesting interpretation of this movie where Jennifer Lawrence is actually the devil XD.
I don't think Biblical stories work very well as allegories because they are pretty nonsensical and not really good storytelling in the first place. Stuff just happens without any real plot or point. People just use them because they're well known and worshiped, figuratively and literally.
This guy sounds like me in Filmmaking class in high school. I made a film about a guy called Paolo who was meant to be Apollo.
Aronofsky clearly likes anime since he's stolen scenes from Perfect Blue.
do ya get it?
its funny that they would have the story of the prodigal son in this movie, mainly because that story was a fable a metaphor for a life lesson. So they took a metaphor and tried to make a literal adaptation of it in a movie full of supposed metaphors.\n\nBut I actually studied the Bible so I went in with a big smile just restless in my seat so i can sit there and see how off the mark they were!
Thought it was fucking awful. Was pretty good for the first 45 mins- hour or so then it just sharply turns to pretentious bollox. Figured out a lot of the metaphorical stuff in the cinema and then read some more when I got home and I just think it's rubbish. For the first time in as long as I can truly remember I just wanted to walk out of the screen and head home, was that bored, I'm sure many a more hipster gentleman will tell me I just didn't get it but to me this has now become the movie equivalent of that pair of glasses left on the floor of that art gallery that people then began to circle jerk around for how 'brave' and 'daring' it was.
at preview screenings reviewers were asked to wait a week before posting their reviews, because the movie is so deep and complicated you can't possibly know how you feel about it right away.......fuck that pretentious art wank.
Darren Aronofsky went Full-Ridley-Scott.  DUDE!  You NEVER go Full-Ridley-Scott!\n\nRumour has it, Ridley Scott wanted to direct Mother.  Technically speaking I just invented that rumour up.  Technically speaking he was too busy f*cking up every movie he can get his paws on.  \n\nTHANKS, Ridley Scott!
Can we talk about how awful the cinematography was? \nDo you like watching close-ups of Jennifer Lawrence? So, how about watching her face jumping up and down in a tightly framed shot for two hours... with a poorly lit, blurry background?\n\nIt was shocking to me.
I think Lawrence is just very dependent on the director. I liked her a lot in American Hustle and silver linings. She can deliver powerful stuff, one just has to lead her there.
Jennifer Lawrence blamed the recent hurricanes are as punishment for electing trump. She actually dared people not to see her film.
I didn't see it as a retelling of the bible, but more so about how a creative person i.e.: a writer/director/poet cannibalizes his personal life for financial/artistic gain, even at the expense of those who he holds dear, like his wife. I didn't even really catch all the bible stuff tbh, I was more into my interpretation since it makes it more personal.
I have to watch Possession now, thanks for the recommendation.
A PURELY metaphorical film sucks. That's only the skeleton of the movie. Ya gotta flesh it out - pun intended - with heart, humor - ya know, reality. \n\nI was gonna check out this film. Thank God I saw these hack frauds first.
But Jesus was a space alien engineer!
lets get this out of the way out of the bag..i've heard that before from mr.plinkett you hack frauds
Jennifer Lawrense declined to speak to russian journalists at the press conference. Bravo! You show dem russkies how to meddle in our elections!
DO YOU GET IT?
17:30 Haha. You can make a similar supercut with Angela's expression (from Mr. Robot). :)
I used to be a real cinephile. I loved movies and I enjoyed life. Then I discovered this channel and now I hate everything.

NICE BOTOX JOB, JAY!
Koyaanisqatsi did it better
Watch The *FUCKING* Wrestler, Mike!
Pretentious means pretending to have a meaning Jay. Lynch is pretentious because his movies mean nothing. Darren stated his meaning out loud. The meaning may be stupid, but either way he isn't pretentious. I think the only reason I still watch this show is to witness Mike roll his eyes at everything Jay says. He must know how much better he could do. It's a shame he's anchored to such idiocy.
What an ugly movie poster.
Best movie of the year imo
She is so gross and can't act for shit

The Fountain is the worst movie I've ever seen
If it's an allegory concerning climate change woudn't that make it an algorey ?
A house as a metaphor for the earth is an interesting idea, why did they feel the need to drown it out with biblical metaphor? That's dumb.
Every film Jennifer Lawrence is in she has the same gaunt open mouth expression
This guy sort of looks like ggg
Hehe minions REEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Is this guy wearing a rug in 2017? Stop hiding be yourself.
Small potatoes is my favourite AG parody
I literally live 4 blocks away from the house!
You know Vox is full of bullshit when they laugh at Minions.
When I was taking art history, I believe the teacher told us that the picture depicts a father and daughter & not a husband and wife. I could be wrong. I haven't found any Source material to substantiate it yet.
Vox is fake news. No, I take that back. *Vox is very fake news.*
The title should've been Why American Gothic become iconic \nY'all dropped the ball on this one
i feel like this painting might haunt my dreams ;_;
When I was little I always thought those two people were miserable and probably mean to kids, LOL.
could you do edward hopper's nighthawks? its one of my favourites and as much as I love it artistically, much like with american gothic, I don't understand how it got parodied so much
loved the Maher burn. thank you for that
The girl was the daughter not the wife, just btw
I saw this in red Robbins.
Fresh off the boat anyone ?
Why is there a no-scoping sound all the time lol
The woman in the painting is supposed to be the man's spinster daughter, not his wife.
This Overrated series rushes it's arguments, nitpicks data and presents it all as the truth, not as an opinion. An example is that they try to make us think the painting was only sold for 300 dollars (and is therefore unremarkable), whereas in 1930 that was equivalent to more than 4,100 today's dollars, so probably a pretty good payday.
tell me why I thought that was my stomach rumbling
I love this new series by Vox :-)
Then is the Mona Lisa overrated Cuz it's basically a women smiling
Why do the majority of Vox videos have soooo many dislikes? I've looked everywhere, online, asked here, everything I know to do. Anyway, does anyone know,  anybody at all have any idea?
About two minutes in I felt the urge to punch the dude in the face, and the rest of the vid explains why!
So basically this painting was like the first meme, and all memes of this painting are inception memes.
is it weird that I'm binge watching Vox videos?
pls do audrey hepburn!! i love her so bad but shes so overrated
Do Phantom of the Opera!!!
This Guy just came out from MAD magazine.
A few days ago there was video by Vox where the guy just went on an on about white painting, where the so called modern artists painted the canvas totally white and hung it on a wall. The narrator argued that it wasn't nothing. And here they are calling a painting overrated which actually has some colour and humans and real life objects in it. I am not saying this is a great piece of art. But then again white painting isn't art either.
I thought this video was gonna be about how American gothism became famous
So was it a good meme?
Let's not be categorically down on small towns.  The only problem they _all_ have in common is a dearth of good reading material.  Bring me wi-fi and a well-stocked, fully-equipped, modern library, and there's little else I need.
So the painting made a big debate in the early days...uh,okay.
KC Chiefs fans got their own American Gothic ambiguity meme just last year\nhttp://i.imgur.com/U5NJojY.jpg?1
How the hell do they make this video without calling it : How American Gothic became so iconic. Come one people, rhymes
I think the first time I saw this painting was in desperate housewives.
I had the pleasure of seeing this famous piece this summer!
So...it's not overrated? Famous and overrated are not synonymous
The appeal to me was always in the name. It *felt* subversive compared to the painting. It felt like the artist wanted me to find something that might not be so obvious by just glancing at it.\n\nI guess he was. And the time I spent analyzing the painting only to realize it was right there the whole time.
please do the dogs playing poker!
I much prefer 50s American Art Deco
3:13 is when the vid starts
I think it is important to note the $300 in 1930 is worth around $4300 today. With the Great Depression starting already it might have not been seen as a small amount.
Typical American.. self obsessed and pretentious ... What an Art!!
This might be the first time I've seen any version of this painting.
What came first and second that year?
I did a project for this in art class.
The mic this guy is using sounds trash
Give this theme to nerdwriter please
Are you saying Grant Wood created the first meme?
I wish I could BS dialogue for the obvious like this dude.
Amy Schumer is on it, that answers your question
Memes are a lot like this, therefore memes are art
So, this is like a pepe? A hate symbol that has been parodied over and over.
Vox is one of the best YouTube channels that I never hear anyone talk about.
Do a video on how vox become fake news propaganda.
Of course they would make a video about American gothic.....1 year after I was learning it.
How much wood would Grant Wood grant if Grant Wood could grant wood?
ПОСТЕЛЬНОЕ БЕЛЬЕ\nС УНИКАЛЬНЫМ ДИЗАЙНОМ.\nБайкеры Готика http://c.twkv.ru/hqpq
$300 in 1930 = $4,211 today
Art itself is overrated.

damn fine storytelling.
Hello from Cedar Rapids.
Grant Wood uglies up his sister, ends up painting Kristen Wiig
Just chillin in Cider Rapids
Cool story
What is uhmericuh?
These Overrated vids are rather edutaining
Bill Maher BURN
1:42 looks like putin
IOWA
Your overrated video suck
Nice video!
I like it but it's super depressing.
I saw the original, at the art institute of Chicago something really unique
Love the videos like this you guys are doing -- keep it up.
I enjoy the painting
It's another Phil Edwards vid! Yes!
What a piece of crap
300 dollars in 1930 would be, adjusting it for inflation, the equivalent of about 4,200 dollars in 2017. Still a small sum for a painting considering that some paintings today go for millions.
I'm a little disappointed that they didn't reference the parody of it in The Music Man. \nAny musical theatre people here?
I hate how I had to thumbs down this vid for stupid sound effects
Y’all can’t tell me this ni🅱️🅱️a ain’t look like Macklemore😂💀
Great series. Can't wait to see more!
I LOVEEEEEE all your explained art videos <3 Please keep making them!
American Gothic is creepy and depressing IMO
Flesh eating virus in Australia. Stay aware. Please look.
Grant Wood had an extremely stout physique AND he was from Iowa; he must have been a wicked good wrestler.\nAnyway, nice painting.
Beginning-> What?\nEnding-> What?
Simple times. Lack of annoying whiney crybabies and lazy wimpy fem boys.
So he was the man who painted the devil's work of G. Wash. Thanks.
hey hye psst if you wathhc this u'll feel realy good\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnafgBUG7U4&t=8s
Just chillin in Cedar Rapids
That shitty painting needs more cowbell.....and bigger boobies.
Will you make my dream come true? Look at my name, thank you.
The worst Vox video I have ever watched.  There is nothing overrated about this masterpiece, as the test of time has proven.  Don't make videos about subjects you know nothing about.
When art used to be good.
Same design like the iPhone 6 when will apple ditch this design
Can we use Samsung wireless charging on iPhone 8 ?
Why do I want this phone but then a few months later, I’ll want the black one? It’s happened with every white iPhone I’ve had lol
Where is the most expensive? In Hungary...thanks 😩😂 I hate this shit country 😂😭
These at not the iPhone 8 and x
Not worth the upgrade
I like this Samsung
Dude...you are trying hard......😂..keep up the work..
Should I get the iPhone x is it Worthed where I am from it cost 50 000
Am I the only one who hated this color?
So which one is 8 Plus ?
I would rather wait for the price to drop than buying it this year
.seriously iphone 8? LOL just a waste of money... just stick to iphone 7
I'm watching this on iPhone 5 lol
I’ll just stick with my 7plus
The iPhone 8+ requires a case, as it's basically all glass. The iPhone 7+ just needs a good screen protector.
Video filmed with a Samsung note 8
Apparently there is a dark mode. Accessibility -> Display accommodations -> Invert colors -> Smart invert
The new camera mode will it be available to the iPhone 7 Plus ?
Hey man what’s up with your mic? So much echo🤔
Eap when I go to camera on my iPhone 6s the screen is black how fix?
tbh, the 6, 6s and plus had the best and sexiest design.
Lmao that’s a 7+... good try man..
If u will say apple good then  does your day  goes wrong?\nEverbody give this video a 👎👎👎
They should have skipped the iPhone 8 and moved directly to the X, aka: Samsung S8
Is there a 3g touch?
Lol is that all
The main reason I won't upgrade is the weight. My 6s plus (with case and glass screenprotector) is too heavy already and this 8 plus is 10 gr extra. Big mistake Apple. The X is what we want as a real upgrade, but it's way to expensive for a smartphone. What Apple had to do? Bring the X as the new model for a normal (still expensive) Apple price, like the 7 plus. With 128 GB, because that's what we need. 64 is a bit small, 256 GB is far to much for normal use. Mind my words, Apple is loosing marketshare here.
The most excited about speed test
Introducing the new iPhone 7s I mean iPhone 8+
Should I get the iPhone 7 or iPhone 8?
Cant wait for a camera comparison between 7plus and 8plus!
can anyone send me an apple iphone 5s space grey color iphone 16gb... please give reply
Whoever pays $1K on this phone is ridiculous.
Is it just me or iPhone 7 plus looks much better than iPhone 8 because aluminium body is looking much better
The iPhone 8 should be bigger than the iPhone 7 plus
Does anyone know if the 7 plus will get the studio lighting features?
After 10 years my iPhone 7 plus is my last iPhone!
Save your money. Apple is spinning it's wheels
does it have gestures to move stuff like pictures,music nn stuff😛😛😛
That's a 7 plus boi
Does the iPhone 8 or the X rec stereo sound on video? Does anyone knows or care? If I ll spend 1000 dollars on a phone that’s rec mono sound doesn’t make sense
2:21 what was that shit man
Can I have one of your spare iphones ?? Pleaseeeeeeee
video was too long. Halfway through it, I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix my self a sandwich. But then I found out that I'm out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I'm really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I'm a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she'll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she's the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can't sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can't take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she's sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what's up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video. She said, you know what, I've been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer. So we opened that drawer, and lo and behold, there's my phone and this video still had four minutes of play time on it.
Is this a iPhone 6 or that new 8? Couldn’t tell the difference
I am in shok, I will receive mines tomorrow, soo fast😍😍
Is that seriously Iphone 8 plus ! it just looks like he has changed the colour of the back of Iphone 7 plus
The reason why you couldn't get portrait mode working is because you needed to move further away
What Apple does is wait for other companies to innovative and design so they can avoid risk, then copy and take it as thier own and not give credit. They act like thier products are flagship but that's not the case, the all new is years old already.
You should do a drop test on the phones to see how durable they are like if you agree
It doesn’t worth the upgrade if you’ve the 7 plus...maybe also the 6s plus
Um The Camera Is Horizontal In This Video The IPhone 8 Has A Vertical Camera
The only thing apple has changed is that color  😓😓
Too much echo in your room
can i have ur 7 +
Um I’m sorry but all I got was bad reviews. 😟
galaxy note is just so much better
Are you giving away those shits... I would needing one
So you are just doing the voice over on a video made by someone else ? I noticed the ring missing in your left hand.
I have 6s should I upgrade ?
I hope you do a giveaway🙏 Would be really awesome if you did. I have been looking for an upgrade👍😁😃
Has a smaller battery than last model also.
Waiting for the IPhone X who else...?
NO HEADPHONE JACK\nNO USB TYPE C\nNO FAST CHARGER\nNO FAST CHARGE CABLE\nNO EARPHONES\nSAME BORING ICONS\nSAME BORING DESIGN\nBUT MORE EXPENSIVE
Honesty so disappointed with both 8 and x - I’ll stick with my 7+ until the next ones come out, which will be a while I know! If I’m desperate for a new phone I may go for the x, but that’s as a last resort.
Still of the opinion it should have been called iPhone 7s. They’re basically identical come on....and the new colors are a downgrade tbh
When the hell did iPhone 8 come out
Samsung is 1000 times better just saying :)
They look the exact same😒
Abooot
Lowkey liking this new brown/gold colour
Impressive
Give me one iPhone 7 please
Dude u are ranked #31 on trending!

Drop test?
Phone: “Move further away”\nEAP: We didn’t get it to work
I need battery drain test in 7+ vs 8+ and 7 vs 8
Eww that brown color looks disgusting in my opinion
Should I upgrade from 6 plus to 8 plus? My 6 has been slowly becoming slower:/
what a crap phone
Dude it's Ip7 not 8,,, 8 has full display edge to edge

U literally can feel all the words coming out of his mouth, and if a someone can do that ,it doesn't take a legend to figure how a great a singer he is. He was popular in India too a country which loves its cultural music.This tells u that what a great artist he was and how many people heart's touched.I sobbed through the entire song and he was flashing at the back of my mind.Really miss him\nRip Chester😭😭😭
Get this video 1 million + likes for Chester ❤

😞really nice song\nit's emotional
thanks for let me grow up with all your songs\nand thanks for all the fans who mocking him for making the latest album just because he sing a melo song
3:24 who would have thought such a guy was depressed...
Fourteen, young producer, need tips to improve. thanks. :)
This is made me cry again 😢😢
No, I'm not criying... Well, maybe yes.
How can somebody dislike this?\nWe love you,Linkin Park will never die.
Even today its just like a nightmare knowing how Chester, loved by so many and wrote so many iconic songs, took his life and turned his own life off in the passing of a second. Chester, I will never forget the times I listened to your songs while playing my first games in League of Legends. I'll never forget the times I kept getting scolded for singing your songs out loud. I'll never forget that one time I bothered my sister just to watch your concert. Ill never forget the memories of me simply enjoying your songs, lying back on my chair while I listen to your albums. Chester, I hope your happier where you are now. And while I don't want to say it, I hope whatever troubled you has been relieved. You were my childhood's greatest singer. Rest In Peace.\n\nSincerely,\nR.S
This video break my heart.
chester would be proud of you all guys, what a beautiful song for a wonderful man and inspiration to many not only that he had a family who he loved as we all know he is now shining bright, Chester has made a hell of a life with the guys in the band and now they will carry on for him!!!! R.I.P Chester another star gone but never forgotten 💖💖💖💖💖😇😇😇😇 xxxxx

Thing You Dont Know about Linkin Park\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T08QXDymMkI
Rest in peace Chester! I can't wait to be able to listen to gigs in heaven
How could this get 5k dislikes \n\n\nrest in peace Chester
When your getting married and you are asked if you take such and so to be your wife/husband and you reply iiiiiiiiiiiiii dooooooo
Chester is maybe gone but he will be forever in our hearts.\nRIP Chester!!
this use to be #10 on trending now its #36 youtube is messed
Impossible to see without crying .. Who cares if one more light goes out? well i do, Chester :'(
For anyone out there who is contemplating suicide, listen to me. Suicide is never the answer. It will get better. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. You have a purpose. Don't throw everything away. Your life has meaning. People care. Don't be afraid to talk to someone. If you need help, reach out. You will find support.
This is so deep, I truly love this song
This is why Linkin Park always be better than the others..........
Part of my teenage days died with you chester 😢
I almost cried at the end when you showed the LP logo
7 years listen a song,my heart,ow my heart,💔💔,#ripchester
2 months, and I still can't believe, my dream was to hear LP live...
This is soo beautiful...😢❤
still waiting for one more light but it never comes
I can’t listen to this song without crying
Dis is the last song of you I'm man I'm can cry to... I love all of your song....now you is legend for me.. 😭😭
Only true Linkin Park Fans will cry😥

Good song
Forever soldier, forever Linkin Park. FOREVER CHESTES. SEE YOU.
Chester once. Chester always. Chester forever.

Notification squad
Its so crazy to watch you move in again. Like your first move in video was the video that got me to subscribe and then keep up since then, like you as a person grew and change and so have i . Its insane how much a year goes and how many things change but im glad watching your videos remains as a constant in my life♡ keep it up !!
haha omg when I saw that you were flying to pvd I was like 😱😱😱 I go to school there too! I'm at brown university 😋
I started crying when I saw your granny, because it remembered me of my grandfather who died 3 months ago. Also he wanted us to succeed ❤️
the clips with your grandfather are so beautiful, sending all my love to you and your family & hope he gets well soon
Just discovered your channel and I'm so glad I did. They're so real and your outlook on life is comforting and inspiring, makes me feel not so alone. Best wishes to your family ❤️
I love her videos it's so relaxing
You're so lucky to have your vlogs with your grandpa...you'll treasure those. I still have voicemails from my pa-pa and they're invaluable. Grandpas are the best, aren't they??
this is #44 on trending !!
I actually started crying after you said goodbye to your grandfather ❤
You're grandpa is so sweet and loving. Thank you for sharing such a precious moment. ~
Praying for your grandfather. He reminded me of mine and I kinda teared up. ♥️
Ahahah when your kitty was meowing my cat paced back and forth of the house trying to find where it was coming from
How poor your grandma is ! Get the embrace just for cinema.
It's sad seeing that your grandfather isn't doing well. \nI'm praying for him and your family. X
These vlogs are so cute and they feel so artistic and each one is really original! There's always beautiful music and scenery that you put in. Love them
you're worth being on trend💛 LOVE YOU SO MUCH
the love was radiating from the screen during your visit to your grandfather and you got me really emotional. family is so sacred <£
I really appreciate your vlogs! I was feeling mellow on Sunday morning and a binge-watch of all your videos I had missed put me in such a lovely mood so thank you <3 I'm so happy for you that you get to share a dorm with your sister and it's made me even more excited to see your videos. I hope your cute little grandpa feels better xxx
wish you the best girly!!
Anabelle baby! You made me cry and I just did my makeup for my first day in uni. Hope everything goes well with grandpa. Much love 💗💗
Loving you sister's hair!! Also, that doggie is soooo cute! All the best for you girls on this new adventure! :)
I've never been close to my grandfather because he was an abusive husband but I still see him from time to time, cherish your grandfather and I hope he gets better❤️
Love your selection of music :)
God bless your grandfather, seems like such a sweetheart. Wanting you to succeed, that's true love.
Your videos give me some type of unusual warmth.
Seeing your grandpa in hospital was so heartbreaking for me I hope things will get better for you and your family...
Omg she moved? 😱 since when and why? 😱 I just had a marathon on watching her old vlogs just few days ago 😂
I cried a little on the shot of you and your grandpa's hands 😪 so beautiful. I hope he gets well soon!
I almost cried on the grandpa part ... :(
Everything about your vlogs are just so so lovely <3 (also your sister's haircut reeaally reminds me of Haru at the end of The Cat Returns)
Seeing the interactions between you and your grandfather, really made me miss my grandma so much more. Just lost her last month due to cancer, and still really miss her so much, but am glad she's happy up there now ☺️ Thankyou for this wonderful clip.
2:24 i'm actually sobbing right now
oh jesus this video made me so emotional, your editing style is everything. i hope your grandpa is doing better :)
annabelle : i cant write long description\nalso annabelle : *write super long description and listing down all the things she wear in vlog*
OMG BLACK BEAR DINER I THINK  I SAW U
Thank you for sharing a clip of your grandpa with us <3
This is my very first video I've seen of yours and I already knew that I liked you but then you started mentioning your grandfather and I just have to say, I've been in the exact same position, except unfortunately when I went to visit him in hospital he didn't remember me unlike yours did. I really enjoyed this video, it was rather refreshing to watch and I am in love with your editing style! Can't wait to go on a binge watch on all your videos! Hope your grandfather gets better soon <3
when you were talking to your grandpa with your family i started tearing up man
Aww, I really love your uni vlogs. They make me feel more excited and motivated for school!
woahh aside from the fact that this video was filmed freakin amazingly, im still shook over how i've never thought to place the dorm beds upside down!!
The part where you and your grandpa were together made me start crying because it reminded me of my grandpa and how he's been sick lately. Hope your grandpa will get better soon and come back to stay with your family! Love your vlogs btw and have a gr8 school year
Wow you got real lucky with your room
I get so excited every time you post a new video! Thank you for sharing 🌷💕
I go to Providence college. Maybe I'll see you around!
Ugh that sweet family moment just made me think of my late grandpa and how I really didn't to say goodbye. I truly miss his wittiness.
aw your grandpa is so cute! best wishes and may he feel better soon!
I cried when I got to the part with your grandpa, it was so beautiful to see you guys embracing him and showing support. It looks like he really really loves you and was happy that you came to see him. I pray for his safe recovery 💝
Im applying to RISD! Do they allow pets???
You probably won't see this but it's so nice seeing a YouTuber that is in ri, I live I ri
I hope your grandfather gets better ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Praying for your grandpa, hope he gets better soon!!
I just lost my grandfather last month and he was hospitalized for so long before passing. This video was so sweet and made me think of him. I’ll be praying for you and your family.
Seeing your grandfather like that hit me really hard. I lost my grandmother last year, and then my grandfather passed earlier this year in January. It’s hard seeing them like this. I hope you stay strong through these hards times. Much love 💕
I love your vlogs and have been watching since you moved to risd last year, I lost my granddad this and I am sending my best wishes to him and your whole family 💛

超爱你的vlog 希望爷爷快点好起来哦！
I hope your grandfather gets better soon. Also your sister is so cute I'm very much looking forward to vlogs from you guys :)
witnessing your growth through the beautiful videos you've made over the past years and the small parts of your life that you've allowed us to see has been an honor, thank you Annabelle.
Your grandfather is so cute 💜❤️💙
I loved watching the clips where you and your family spoke Chinese because I'm learning how to speak it :)
seeking you vlog your grandfather makes me miss my grandma s much :'c I'm so happy for you that you're able to spend time with him and that you have this vlog to look back on whenever you like <3 wishing the best to you and your family
Is that even a frickin dorm wth. If i lived there, im just probably gonna fill it with plants and succulents.
i hope your grandfather gets better 💗
Hey your videos are so inspiring and so raw and really full of talent and just too wonderful. Glad that your grandpa still is in good spirits and ever so joyful. He sure is a gem! Us YouTube fam will be will you through anything so keep being strong (: we love you so! And your sis 💓
Now that Annabelle's sister cut her hair, she kind of looks like JuNCurryAhn
Sending prayers and love for your grandfather ❤
Im from Swansea MA! Right next to seekonk! Im always shopping in seekonk I hope to run into you! :)
i hope your grandfather gets better. i absolutely love your vlogs there’s something very special about them that i’m just so connected to them. i wish you and your family well xx much love 💛
I hope your grandfather gets better.
Where did your sister get those amazing outfits? Look book!
your grandfather is so sweet, i hope he gets well soon!
seeing your grandfather being so happy there made me cry because he reminds me of my grandfather who just passed away few weeks ago.
Your sister's haircut really suits her!
Oddly, your scene with your grandfather was cathartic for me. I had never gotten a chance to say goodbye to my grandmother before she passed away in a car crash, and I guess that scene just reminded me of her in a strange way with the hospital room and the Chinese being spoken all around. I started tearing up at that part.
for some reason i loved this vlog more than others. idk what it is but i really enjoyed it. it maybe the aesthetic lol
Where do you get your background music from?
I happy we will get to see more of your sister!
Clicked onto your video immediately. I love watching your videos, I love your editing and aesthetic.\nGood luck this school year to you and your sister (:
your vlogs are so beautiful. I hope our grandfather finds peace!
I miss my grandfather :( I'm glad I got to spend time with him the day before he was gone 3 months ago.  Cherish your moment with your grandpa. :( I'm literally in tears T_T
The little message at 1:36 😂
sooo cool that the time for you and your sister to attend uni together has arrived! you place looks really roomy, and I can't wait to see what you guys do with all of the space\nhappy to see your face on here again!
OHHH NOO!!! I really hope your grandfather get's better. He is the cutest.
You glorify the little things in the best way imaginable. It makes me see that life is so fleeting and precious and pretty. Thank you <3
your grandpa is the cutest ever :')
Back?
omfg finally!!! i love your uni daily vlogs
Hope your grandpa gets well soon ❤️
I WATCH ANYTHING WITH BLAKE SO I WILL BE WATCHING THIS.
is anyone else confused
Song name?
This plot reminds me of that movie with Nicole Kidman and Colin Firth just that she had amnesia and here Blake is blind
So did she found out she's married to an older man, and she's a young woman taken advantage due to her blind sight ???
Good song by HAZAMA \nhttps://youtu.be/QuufCmRkLns
whats going on
love it !!!
You'll float too
Great... another It Comes at Night
I think I had read a book a lonf time ago where a woman gets eyes transplanted and her personality starts to change to that of the donor  and she becomes very paranoid while another person who got a heart surgery also changes in personality and both do a total 180 degree flip... but tht donor was possessed or somthinf so thay thig becomes part of these two.
So she starts seeing and cheats on her husband.
C U C K E D
Chilling, i literally have chills all over
Wait what
Thank you Philip DeFranco.
Use eazycash for $50 http://featu.re/eazycash
Well shit. 😃
Who else is lost?
I don't get it.
Looks great, Blake Lively is awesome
They already made this movie.. is called The Ticket
Very good by the looks of it . Can I get 50 subs without making any videos. I'll sub back too 👍
Why are all trailers now made creepy? I bet the actual movie is not creepy at all,  the plot makes it sound more mystery
I would say this to my pizza. All I see is you....\n\njokes aside, If you reverse the gender roles and tone down the horror, it might look like the movie The Willow Tree where a man regains his sight (after losing it in his childhood) and rethinks his marriage and life. in the end his body rejects the transplantation and he loses his sight.
Blake keeps rising on her acting skills and the quality of her films
What's the fucking plot
Watching this trailer, I have absolutely no idea if this is a horror movie, a psychological thriller, a drama about an abusive relationship or something else entirely...
Bloody chick movie... I was waiting for a terminator to show up... you can take the eyes out of a whore but you cant take the whore out of the eyes
Story of a rotting girl
Ummm movie is all over the place.
I wonder how this movie is gonna turn the man into something bad, and the woman into some kind of hero?\nHmmm
He knew once she seen what he looked like and how she looked she was cheating lol
captions please!!
I'm actually scurred
My Last Duchess
WTF?! Watching!
That's fucked up
Seems very interesting
What
tukin
Can’t wait !
Must see

Serena Van Der Woodsen
Heckin heck this I'm playin Odyssey
ch chaa
She is sexy
Blake lively❤️
I wouldn’t blame my wife once she saw me.
So the husband goes out of his way to get her an operation to see again and the first thing she does is fuck some other guy. That's some grade A cunt right there.
why serena still a hoe even after gossip girl...
Fucked up version of At First Sight
Every eye movie I've seen was stupid
Sorry Stranger Things 2 is on that day also
the movie will end with him blinding her again to try and get her to stay with him
It can't be thriller without a sex scene huh!?
another marriage is horrible and men are all evil plot, so original

Woman gets sight and best a whore and then loses sight again.
That turned dark real fast😳
It's said that the ideal arrangement is a blind woman with a deaf man. Playa had it half right. Done messed up.
Is Ryan ok with this ?

Serena what happened to you?
Omg Blake lively😍
why didnt she divorce first
No need to watch this movie. Eyesight makes her a whore. The end.
It seems the only real hardship this loving couple faces is difficulty conceiving a child but when Gina is given the...\n\nI bet he was giving her Plan B, but told her they were prenatal vitamins or something.
A wise man once said... THESE HOES AIN'T LOYAL
Did the guys over at Explosm Entertainment make this trailer?
She's given a second chance at sight and the idiot chooses to ruin her body with cigarettes.  Classic.
Slowing down a pop song in the trailer  trend needs to die ...
The husband ends up re-blinding her in the end because his fear of losing her becomes too great.\n\n\nOops!   SPOILERS!
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, I'M SCARED.
Finally a trailer that doesn't give away the damn plot!!! It looks good
There is almost a  20 year age difference between the two actors...
They should've had Ryan Reynolds play the husband hands down. I'm not saying that you should have the real couple play the couple in movies, I'm just saying that they are already a perfect couple in real life and they both happen to be amazing actors, so Ryan should've without a doubt played the boyfriend/husband role.
Idk her acting is never that convincing to me especially in emotional scenes but looks interesting
She looks like that Blake girl......oh
Looks like after getting her sight back, Serena Van der Woodsen's starting to *see* his true colors. Xoxo, Gossip Girl.
It would be cool if her husband wasn't a psycho but instead he left her and she took her sight for granted but at the end of the movie after she has lost everything her husband comes back.
They should change the name of the movie to All I see is your pussy lol \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm joking
AHHH SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!!!
This is AMAZING!!! X
Victoria you're one of the only Youtubers I comment on who has a large following but still comments back to her followers :) I am a recent commenter, long-time watcher, and really appreciate your honesty and humility on the camera :) xx
2 amazing inspirational women :) xx
Ahh you look so happy and very humble to be invited to such an amazing event - you're practically glowing like morning aura itself! Love all those looks on you and I have to get my hands on that blush/bronzer thats on your cheeks in the last frame of you looking into the camera - its just stunning!
I hate how hotel bathroom lights make everyone look tango'd!
I'm so intrigued by the VB Estée Lauder line, particularly the contrast between Victoria as a spokeswoman and Kendall Jenner for the Estee edit. I'm really growing tired of celebrity lines that lack real involvement from the celeb themselves. But I really appreciate VB's passion behind the collection, and believe there was a true collaboration between the brand and herself.  Plus Victoria! I see the similarities between you and VB. Intelligence passion and style!
Looks amazing Victoria, one to remember forever!! Love that skirt, I have a similar one and it just comes out time and time again!! X
Nicely done and well deserved!  All your looks were perfection.  LOVE VB! 💙💙
How exciting! What a wonderful opportunity and great experience! Congratulations on being so poised and lovely while having a random chat with Victoria Beckham... as you do. You looked gorgeous!

Love, love, LOVE this! xxx

Victoria squared! Victoria beckham is one of my favorite designers, her clothes are so beautifully made and the fit is amazing!
You were so sweet when you were interviewed Victoria Beckham, you could tell it was your dream come true but you were so composed and professional.

Gosh, I wasn't even considering trying the new VB makeup until I saw your video with the different looks. How would you compare the VB looks to the Charlotte Tillbury looks in a box?
WoW Victoria! Huge milestone, congratulations! So cool to know where YouTube has taken you, not that I live in England or anything but I´ll just keep on working on my channel as well and hopefully some day cool things will come my way!
This vlog actually made me so emotional. Anyone who watches you knows that she is one of your biggest inspirations so to see you get to talk with her and get invited to these intimate events with her, I don't know why but I could have cried. I literally got choked up watching you interview her haha. Beautiful looks as always <3
WOW ! you cant call this work.. :-) meeting VB... but you work hard every day and deserve these lovely moments Vic, pleased for you, the new collections look so well made and look good on you. xxx
hey inthefrow! u look absolutely gorgeous and you would have outdone VB if u wouldn't have slouched ua body and carried ua self with more confidence! U were more beautiful than VB but her poised body language won the show there !

Your face when you were talking to VB is gonna be my face when I get to meet you someday 😻
I personally think VB is a bit overrated....she is ok....her style and her look is alright but nothing special....I think she is the one who should be thanking you and be grateful to  young beautiful bloggers like yourself are giving her products the time of day....\n🤗😉
You looked amazing as usual! I'll be taking some autumn wardrobe inspiration from you!
Oh what I would do to be in your shoes! (Metaphorically and literally, cuz your shoes are always on point)💕
Your outfits were fantastic, what a great trip!

Beautiful outfits and makeup! Thanks for the vlog! Correct me if Im wrong but you have met Victoria B before am I right?
I was grinning the whole time you were interviewing Victoria, so so happy for you - you deserve all of the amazing opportunities you are having! I have no clue how you were so chilled and candid when meeting her... very jealous! xxx
Loved the looks and your personality too, amazing 😍
Anyone knows what watch she is wearing? :)
Victoria was highkey fangirling lol
Hay when can us in the uk buy the VB and EL make up xxxxx
When you said Victoria nude, I was thinking Victoria Mcgrath nude which was YSL!! 💜
Hang on, hang on ... stop right there. Victoria Beckham - VICTORIA BECKHAM - said you looked lovely in her dress?! I die! But of course, she's absolutely right ;) xx
Can you please recreate the LA look for us ?
Everything is so wearable. When you watch other runways there is not a lot I would wear but hers is beautiful xx
Hi Victoria! Where are your earrings from? I notice you wear them all the time and they look lovely! Love from Guam <3
awww you can tell u were totally girl fanning! So ice meeting ppl u admire :)
Hi Victoria, what is your natural colour of hair? :)
I don't know how old you are, but in the beginning of the video where you have no makeup on, you look like a 17-year old girl! I mean, your skin is perfection! Please upload a skincare routine video ASAP!
I'M SCREAMING!!!!! This is amazing!!!!!
First time I've ever commented on your videos! I did actually sit next to you once at a press dinner but I was too shy to say hello! Any way, I am determined to try and get the lighter glow you do under your eyes, it looks amazing! Hoping I can master it - am worried I'm going to look clown like! Xxx
These girls need to stop acting so grown and thinking they can handle adult situations. Listen to yo momma, sit yo ass down and complete school. Find other TEENAGE interests like dance, soccer, youtubing, makeup, etc. instead of trying to be about that life. This is what you have to do to get those nice things.
How old is she now ?
Why are they all dress like they are about to hit the club after this?
R Kelly made me touch his big black balls!
She want a taste of ROB, Now she is money hungry, R. KELLY  is Innocent . Bad gal who should be in school then.
Who's idea was it to make her look like she's in middle school???
Bitch put the keys in the ignition and gtf outa there
U 16 on a tour bus\n..were was ur parents did u drop out of school...i mean was ☝ im confused...
I believe she can Lie! Lie so much till she reached the sky she tells lies every night and day..she just lied for the press that day
R.kelly is know to a pedo who pisses on underage girls in the early 2000 how did she not know he was a freak
OMG THE REAL IS BACK AND NO.10 ON TRENDING
I don't believe a damn word, that this little Shank, is saying, she got booted out and is now trying, to get paid.  Right, she look's and sound, very traumatized !!! lol
He may be a great singer, but everything else about him turns my stomach. Ever since he married Aaliyah at only fifteen.
She's so beautiful 👌🏽🙌🏽
this is fake news
Yet u people still call Michael Jackson a pedophile...SMDH
Tam...that hair is a NO NO 😪
Sorry but at 16 you know what's up, one time back in the 90s when cashmoney was starting. They where staying at this hotel my sister worked at and they invited my cousin and i to the room. I was maybe like 13 but looked older, and I could smell the weed too.  but i was like hell no something can go down and I didn't want that. I was excited to see them but not to go. So I don't know what these girls expect. So many fans and you get chosen,  theirs a reason. And sorry but why are you at a grown man's trials or whatever , when he sings sex songs. Being a kid and hearing r Kelly,  I knew it was sexy songs, nothing bad now that I am grown. #wakeup
Sorry i don't care how old is she unless if she is less than 13yo. She also should've know better. The responsibility relay on them 50/50.\nWhen i was 15 i started working to support my family. When i was 17, i immigranted to another continent by myself alone.\nThere is something all ppl have called common sense and knowing if what u r doing is wrong.\nThis bitch was looking for fame.\nGurl bye
I find it ironic that R. Kelly gets all the shade and I'm sorry but I don't believe her. On the other hand Huey Hefner has been sleeping with young girls for years so what's the difference. She has no emotion in her face to have experienced a traumatic thing
Where👏🏿Are👏🏿Your👏🏿Parents👏🏿And👏🏿How👏🏿Did👏🏿You👏🏿End👏🏿Up👏🏿On👏🏿R.Kelly’s👏🏿Tourbus👏🏿At 16👏🏿Years👏🏿Old!!??
where did she said she was invited to in 20 seconds? I didnt get the word
So ... she gave her consent for all of this ? Like never said no one time ? Now she running her mouth trying to get payed ... don't get me wrong Kelly is probably some sort of sick pedo but damn if all I have to do is ask I might get laid a lot more too
😂😂Loni said How did you do it
Man cut the bull! You wanted it, you liked it, and you went back for it and continued to engage in it! Lls. Just be real.
and you hung around ...stayed ....keep doing what you were told ..and now >>>drum roll please >>>>I'm a victim  ....she's out for $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Where are your parents? They just let you go on his tour bus alone at sixteen?
R.Kelly: Girl I'm gone beat you when you get home to daddy.
Something is not right .. it's more to these stories .. these women were young .. where was the parents ??.. no schooling ??..... maybe the families were paid.. u never no
It's ok R Kelly is an oppressed black man in a white supremacist society. It's not his fault, it's the fault of the white man. You should all go and riot in the street to fight against the injustice against this poor dindu nuffin brotha.
subscribe in my channel and i will subscribe in your channel
It's so sad women get abused even more from the public for speaking out about a disgusting abusive manipulative man. She never said he raped her, she said she did everything willingly but obviously he was very manipulative. Everyone does not have parents, or if they do it's some trash ass parents who don't care about their children. Abusers chose their victims wisely and know who they can get to do whatever they want. \nAs a child you think like ok I love him, I really want him to like me too and I guess I have to have sex for him to like me. It is dumb but kids that aren't taught think like this, they worship celebrities like God. The process of manipulation is deep, he made her feel loved, her took care of her. She probably thought omg this is the best thing that has happened to me, then the abuser adds in more and more abuse.
LOL. the Real Girls are like wish it was me.. Jajajaja
At the West-2017 exercises, the Russian Ka-52 Alligator helicopter opened fire on viewers\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8fTKJoQvPM
Who would want to bang that ugly chick?
must be a slow week for youtube if this is on trend :/ or something else, I wonder what...
She should stop saying she's 16 as though that's the reason for her naivety. 16, in America a country with so much technology and information and education, speaking fluent English, access to internet maybe even free internet.......oh puh-lease she made her Choice
so what the hell is this it ????   what happened to full interview ????
okey.. 16 years old can understand that u don't have to take ur clothes off if u want to.. gold fucking digger your kind help those pedophiles to hunt for more
u went into the to bus and he was naked, shouldn't dat have alarmed u to get out of there
He going to hell
Do anybody really cares about some damn hoe being with R. Kelly.We have cops around The US killing unarmed black folks.Former Officer Jason Stockley got off last for killing an unarmed black from 2011.The Real need to do better stories than this.
So there is a trainer?? And presumably someone driving a tour bus who could be involved? Have these people ever been required to testify?
The Real, what is the purpose of uploading the same teaser videos you have a social media? I'm unsubscribing. These 1 min or less videos are a waste of time. Bye👋🏽
Don't believe her.
Hold on ???? Aint that the girl from sister sister ?
🎶You a pussy, you get popped. You a groupie, you a op.🎶  If I'm to believe this story (that gets more sensational everytime she tells it) she was INVITED  and She CHOSE to stay and participate. Victim? Slave?  Bish where? You thought you were going to be the new Mrs. Kelly but in reality you were just a plaything and he grew tired of you. You feel used, stupid,  and regret all the stuff you did,  but it was your choice to do them.
This is what he meant by Bump n Grind
I don't believe the mainstream he has a sex cult come on every black celebrity the mainstream media always turns everybody against them at the day did Bill Cosby now they're going to R Kelly again just like they did Michael
Oh please give me a break with this R Kelly mess!!! R KELLY WE need TP4 ASAP!!!!2017 @NOW please!!!
Next move can't erase your past moves
She was 16 and having sex with anyone willing!? Where is her father
Something don't add up. So you're 16 and you go onto a bus with two naked ppl and you're told to take your clothes off and you just do it? Hmmm ok... seems like some one stopped getting paid.... N before anyone comes at me I don't support what this guys is doing but there is always somethings being left out.
Cable is dead. No more tv programming for me. The clips are annoying. I won't watch it another way but online. Oh well. It's a great show but oh well
On the show they also said that she took a lie detector test and she was truthful
I'm gonna need y'all to get it together this season and post clips that have a decent length. 21 secs and broken stories are annoying!
All this happened, but yet u decided to not report it..........
It's the remix to ignition
Trash thot shut up u wanted to do it bc he was famous
Why did your mom let you go to the tour bus? Why did you stay when you seen them take off their clothes? You removed your clothes and had sexual relations with that woman? 🤔
It's sad to see women defending this pig and bring quick to call this woman names. Women support and stand with each other!! No one else will if you don't.
Just to let everyone know, they are not doing longer clips. On Loni's instagram ,YouTube don't get them views they need people to watch it live. This is all we are going to get.
Can they put longer videos smh I'm sick and tired of these short ass clips
First of all I started with her appearance on how she wore no make up to look younger, the cheap yellow shirt the little girl hairstyle and went out of her way to dress down, look innocent and come off as a little girl. This is a grown married woman with a baby. \n\nShe said she walked on a bus and saw Robert and another woman naked. I am sure at that point if she was uncomfortable or confused she like my daughters would have said hell NO and turned right around and walked off that bus. \n\nI have been listening to all these stories and accusations and if your dumb or stupid it would be easy to believe what this WOMAN and others are saying about R Kelly. So let’s start with this. In every state in America statuary rape is a serious crime. Sex with a minor is a serious crime. Agreeing to be in a sex cult is not a crime. We have to distinguish between willing participants and people being held against their will. These accusations would land R Kelly in prison for the rest of his life so I keep asking myself why hasn’t he been arrested and charged with Kidnapping, sexual assault, sexual abuse of a minor and so many other crimes. None of these stories are true. They are lies or else R Kelly would be in jail right now facing multiple felonies. He’s not. \n\nWe’re these girls his sex toys it’s very possible and it would not be the first time a  number of women agreed to be sex partners with the same man. Wouldn’t be the first time a woman was in a controlling relationship. You have to look at the facts of what’s happening. If anything these woman were and their families were saying is true why haven’t they gone to law enforcement and hired an attorney to get this man arrested? Because they are lying. Just like the girl who got an attorney and said she slept with Usher and after she got a little fame and attention she said she was telling a lie and that she never slept with Usher. We have to understand there are people who will do anything to become famous and get attention.
Dumb niggas still showing up at his shows.
This is random and off topic but I wish I knew the name of her blush. It looks amazing on her complexion
These money hungry bitches need to seriously get a fucking job instead of trying to expose celebs with bullshit allegations. First the fat lying bitch holding press conferences on usher, now this broad.
She's a liar, she wanted that golden rain
... take off all your clothes...\nok...\nOK? Just OK??? Geezzz
Whos the whale in the blue dress
So at 16 years old, you don't have enough sense to say NO in that tour bus! You see them naked and you didn't leave? C'mon now!
Well damn ain't this a bit much for day time TV....we're talking about a  grown ass man sexual assaulting a minor, as she stated above she was 16 at the time of meeting him...
@ 16 you surely know the difference between good and bad. The moment he first touched you you should have stayed away or got in contact with the police considering you were seeing him during the court case for the same offence...and where the hell wr ur parents during this whole thing
These comments calling her dumb and naive for not saying no or leaving are insensitive and non compassionate. It's similar to calling women in abusive relationships dumb for not leaving or a person foolish for being with the abusive man (or woman) in the first place. We really don't know what was going on in her mind at the time, even if what was going on in her mind was a thirst for attention/love and thoughts rooted in insecurity. We just don't know.  However it's still wrong for him to be sexually involved with underage women. Period.
Off topic but Adrienne looking like a full course Thanksgiving dinner
Where were your parents at 16, why werent you at home or school? she liked it or liked what she was getting out of it be it money or a lavish lifestyle. At 16 you know what it means when a man says take of your clothes and hes naked and so is a strange lady, she didnt refuse she consented to it. I hate these stories.
Is this the girl he peed on?
How your parents let you be gone to do all this at 16 and you just with the shots wtf are y'all talking to these kids about?
If Tamar was still on the show she would of went off script and been like Girl were was your Mama!
No one forced you to suck his ass you dumb hoe, it was your choice.
She lying
Staaaap!
🙄

Slaaaaag
Fuckin black names are so funny lol
Look at the size of that fucking whale on the right lmao. Can't believe you sad, jobless Americans actually watch this shite.
She said unfortunately R.Kelly was not the first person who had done something to her. She said she was sexually abused as a child.  So that's why it was easier for R. to get to her... pedophiles know who to prey upon. It's absolutely sick.
The real is real for this fr!
If R Kelly guilty of all these b💩 stories what are these lil lying ass girls parents guilty of...#thingsthatmakeugohmmm#

Drops were disappointing.
this shit sucks wet soppy balls
What happend with Ryan Lewis? no longer appears in the title of macklemore video's \nSomeone answer me!
I already had the chance to buy the album at a local shop. And I love it! :)
This song makes me happy :)
You know that moment when you stop the microwave right on 0... Yea me either but if I did this song would be equal to that feeling
Awesome...You never disappoint Mr H. Just give your fans a collaboration with Eminem to top it off!
Well, this is just too fantastic!!! I love them both sooo much.
This lyrics really hit me hard, because I used to be very close to my former best friend 3 years ago. Then I had to switch schools, because my little village doesn't have a secondary school (7th-9th grade in Finland, which is the country I live in). We have never been as close as were back then after that. We used to fight a lot back then, but we always made up and continued having good time together. I never realized how well everything was. Now he has changed a lot and we rarely see each other or talk. But we sometimes do though. We are now in the same school, but the year we were apart from each other changed our friendship a lot. I rarely even see him at school.
This is a fuckin jam I love it so much
How does one simply dislike like this? Or anything from macklemore?
I needed this. Thank you...
Please make a video for this \nAwesome tune here
How happy had this made me 😁\nLove them both!!
ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THANK YOU MACKLEMORE!..LOTS OF LOVE FROM NORTH BORNEO!
So fuc*ing great!!! I didn't knew Kesha has this power in her voice! She's amazing

Omg i love this! you guys are great!
I think MACKLEMORE it's my favorite singer <3
Oh the good old days
It gives me the creeps 👌👌❤
I swear it sounds like I've been around, I've thrown some penis in some things, but I'm here now haha
Mack keeps it so real, Rhat’s why his music is so amazing. And Kesha is absolutely amazing in this.
The picture reminds me of one I have of me and my bestfriend
Remembering all the good times ☺️
Yes, the good old days when there was no hate no Trump as president, no fear in families, when everything seem good, 2017 is a shitty year,
I LITERALLY SCREAMED WHEN I SAW THE FT KESHA
This is a tune!!!!!!! Keep em coming macklemore 😀
To think Macklemore played a show at my high school in 2011... damn Ben you've come so far and I'm so damn proud

oh man. this song is beautiful. hearing this after being here from the very beginning somehow makes it more powerful. i can’t believe how far he’s come, i remember his first album before ryan lewis and all the crazy stuff in between. i’m amazed.
Again and again with amazing music
When the album is named after your mars sign ✌
it's so fucking amazing!!!😢😢❤
Honestly this should've just been Kesha. Macklemore just sounds corny and repetitive. What could've been smh.
Who else here before 1 million?
This song made my day 😍. Anyone else? 😍
I saw kesha and wasn't sure if I would like it...but I do! 🙏👏👏👏👏👏
does anyone else think kesha's part sounds like the main melody in Hills by the Weeknd or am I just the only one?
Kesha has such a beautiful voice

Ahaaa lmao same old shite lfc\nShite players shite manager mr flopp\nAnd deluded pathetic fans\nWen u beat arsenal 4-0 who lost bcz thy never wanted to play for wenger i recall most lfc fans sayin oh wer the best team in england best intertainers n attackin team wer gona blow teams away dis year. Where are those ppl now who sed this is our year, probably got there heads in there asses, or wanking off to another jurgen flopp post match interview. Mate ur fukin seasons over before its even started. Lfc fans slaughtered david moyes wen he was a man utd manager makin jokes bout him, uv got a manager whos worse thn him oh my daize. He must feel soooooo good now. GGMU
Bitter scouse TWAT
It pisses me off SO much that every LFC supporter knew our Defense was the problem but for some reason Klopp and FSG dont try and improve that area! We NEED a new Keeper (we haven't had a decent keeper since Reina!) who breeds confidence in the Team and a NEW CB and LB!  I know we wanted VVD but come on! at least have a back-up! There are LOADS of players better than our CBs!
But Klopp has a great cup record tho doesnt he tho
All you deluded Liverpool fans who love Klopp need to realise hes has almost 2 years now to sort this defence out and if anything it is worse.  I dont just mean defending from our defence i mean all over the field. If we are not on our  A game with the pressure closing down type of football then we are a totally average team. Too much f**king around and changing the team all the time does no-1 any good. Cant understand why he thinks we can have 3 teams for each cup. We should have our first team no matter what and if anyone is injured then some1 gets the chance to step up and prove their worth!
Simple question, would Jose Mourinho still have a bad defense after two seasons transfer windows?
When are you scousers gonna realise that Klopp is just David Moyes with a German accent, glasses and yellow teeth
Its only game, why you have to be mad?
For years we are the nearly men, is it the players, managers or owner? Fsg out now ynwa.
Klopp and Wenger, need to share idea's.
Why does no one understand how much work goes into getting a football team to consistently play good , ofcourse they should (play good) but when dickheads like this one and half the people in the comments blame a bad shot or 'we need mane to win' no team in history had a one man team
I miss the good sturridge
Ach not too fussed, we sabotaged it in order to win the CL, so no harm done! :P\n\nNa being serious, I thought we did look disjointed first half, with Ox not linking up too well yet, or Coutinho and Robertson linking up too well either, but we did create chances. Usually I defend Hendo, but he was absolutely rank last night it has to be said, he kept giving the ball away. Second half we looked like a team of individuals as well, which tbf most of the lads playing haven't played with each other much, but its still no excuse.\n\nOn the plus side, great seeing Ings back.
Seems as ox was the issue then 😂😂😂😂
Did u think ud beat a team of premiership champions with ur team of never will cos Gerrard slipped like a pussy bitches???
i miss my team of the 8o s  and 2001 trebble wining team we want dijmii !!! :0) the stig !!hurry up lala we miss your hunger weve gone soft!! :0(
Well that was fucking embarrassing wasn't it? This is what happens when you fail to sort out your defensive and team depth problems. I think it's looking like a trophyless top 10 finish again. Back the drawing board next summer.
And people need to stop overhyping our players after a couple good results\n\nGood bye hendo\nAnd if Klopp even thinks about playing keita and hendo
This is a fuckin joke now I can't see it getting any better why can't we win games without Mane ??????
Only thing coming out the 0151 is AYSTAR
We had a legendary defence: Hypia, Skrtel, Agger, Carragher, Riise, and Finnan. What on earth happened to our defence? Our defence took a turn for the worst about four seasons ago. Subsequently, it hasn't improved since. We need to optimise our defence primarily, not our attack or midfield. We already have a great attacking squad, however, our defence is dismal to say the least.
Create enough chances... 🤣\n\nDid he even watch the game or at least check the stats before he made this 🤣🤣🤣
arsenal: undefeated since ox left. Liverpool: haven't won a game. robbed you lot 😂😂
Em what's the count now
this is ur year
Hahahah faggot we'll beat you on Saturday too
we are nothing without firmino salah and mane
It's my fault. I wasn't singing loud enough to improve our back four. Sorry Chris I will do better next time
This isn't just this season, it's been season in, season out.  It's become the 'Liverpool way'. Whenever I see possession heading over 60% if we don't have got a lead I fear a poor result.  I really don't get PC mandatorily going off after 45 mins.  Yes say to him, when you start to tire tell the bench, but him going off turned the game.  Robertson then lost the freedom he had and that closed off our main attacks.  Here's a question, what is more tiring for players, playing a run of games where you know your team mates and you give every game a good crack, or chopping and changing where you might be watching your mates lose on TV.  So few games into the season and it feels like f'ing Groundhog Day.  We have a house without foundations and season after season we seem to think that will bring success.  At the start of each season do FSG really want us to challenge, because after so few games, I don't think we will top the table at any stage this season unless others have games in hand.  I've followed this club for 40 years, the last 25 being utterly ropey.  Even the few successes we've had have largely been toss of a coin stuff. (Penalty shootouts). Leicester proved it doesn't have to be the most expensive players but the right players.  Generally our players have poor concentration and are generally weak in game phycology.  Bored of it.  Don't mind losing if it's because our best team have an off day, but sick to death of our club being a work in progress.  Klopp you want us to believe, then start earning your fat salary.
disappointing season after season come on were liverpool and not getting a trophy after a few season is a joke the fans deserve more than having to see every season these type of results just pathetic
I miss kolo and martin
I'm sorry but klopp relied on the second team and they didn't perform simple. Flanagan is garbage and should be nowhere near the premier league.  Woodburn always looks average and just loses the ball,  i don't see the hype.  He looks small,  slow and if he doesn't pass backwards he loses the ball. Average. \nEverything else wasn't too bad but we lacked talent when Phil went off.  \nHarry Wilson or Kent are better than Woodburn.  I remember when sterling came through he was actually good lol he took people on and showed class.  Woodburn hasn't. He scored a tap in and one in preseason.  Forget Wales when he hit one from a distance.  His overall play is poor.  And he is not a winger! \nHe is still young but I think in 45 mins if that was markovic he would have been slated.  He did nothing. We need to stop overrated average players especially scouse players.  Players like suso were much better at the same age. Suso btw would have been great last night but we let him go and become the main man at ac Milan..
it's a micky mouse trophy anyway..it's a blessing in disguise
Woodburn has great future ahead of him and am puzzled why he hasn't been making the bench because he looks like a first change for salah/mane.but taking couhtino off in what felt like a premeditated sub killed us,he was what knitted the midfield n attack together.the ox was erratic on his debut let's not judge him yet people.west ham been linked with cavallio had me thinking well surely klopp will pounce with Lucas n Stewart going smh.#3points on Saturday
We still don't have a top striker. Playing attacking midfielders as a striker ie firmino isn't the answer, unless we find the next Torres or Suarez then 100 shots and no goals will continue.
January has come early this season. It won't turn February until Mane comes back and Coutinho finds his range. But this defence is the most gruesome I can ever remember.
We Need The King To Return King Mane. Without Him We Are Shit.  We Need To Start Showing Are Main Man The Love We Show To The Likes Of The Old Guard. Becouse Believe It Or Not Mane He His The GLUE Of The Team. Watch When He Returns.
Pathetic.  The team lacks real leaders on the pitch.  O how I miss Carra and Bellamy.  Yes, Bellamy.  He was a leader on the pitch, especially up front.  I remember when Carra shouted at Arbeloa when he lost concentration during a match.  We don't have that.  A defensive leader would also help Simon and whoever else are between the posts.
Its become embarrassing we just throw this cup away and being realistic our only chance of a trophy its utter shit that alot of these players are played in a week what takes us a year or more to earn Im tired of hearing about the defence forget that even when we went a goal down were the fuck was our captain again gone missing blowing passes all over the place he has lost a truck load of pace and hes lost in midfield now a lot of kids on that pitch last nite looking for big players to help them and ge them up and nothing every senior player was nowhere to be seen and then on commentary isnt it great to see the senior players in the stand watching the game like would ye get fucked I still cant understand why these results shock me klopp has three games to put it right or he can fuck right off hes making.hodgson look good
Remember when ox wasnt a deal with was going to affect the lemar and VVD deals? good times... sold a lie as usual
We didn't play our best team last night, but the game on Saturday isn't gonna get easier. They are gonna bring back Maguire, Simpson, Schmeichel, Vardy and Mahrez and we haven't won at the King Power in the last three visits (including last night). The only good thing is we don't play at Anfield until October 14th. The way this team is playing atm, playing at home will only hurt them. We have three games until the international break to go out there and recover points in the league and bring our confidence back. Up the Reds.
Bitterly disappointing last night. Ultimately, we didn't deserve to go through after that second half performance. Okazaki came on and changed the game. Ward was excellent and Woodburn was very hungry. Solanke was great. Gomez was solid, apart from the goals of course. League Cup was never a priority, but at least it is one less excuse for Jürgen to use! At the end of the day, another chance of silverware gone - another one bites the dust! Just hopeful that we won't play like that on Saturday. Hope we can use this defeat as incentive to beat them on Saturday!\nC'mon Liverpool! We go again against Leicester City (again!) at the King Power Stadium back in the league! C'mon Redmen! #YNWA ⚽️🔴❤️
this is what happens when most transefer windows we sign shite or potential shite
FSG are the problem but nobody is listening
The biggest idiots of all this are the have faith in Klopp guys. Fucking retards, fucking bastards, fucking misery twats.
you wanker,a few weeks ago u were running your mouth,now u see how crap liverpool is?...anyway how is the Oxlade doing,are u still buzzing u signed him...lmfao
The big German cheerleader 😂😂😂😂😂😂 seriously tho he’s a fraud!!!!
The only good from this match is, Joe Gomez has finally played in CB! Oh, its better to watch him play rather than Klavan or Lovren. Also Henderson maybe need some rest, 'cause lately, his performance was so horrible, cant blame Klopp if in the January market we bought some good DM to replaced him
Let's try another way. Let's do the Pygmalion thing and everyone say we have a great defense.!!.. we have a great defense!!
Sick,is a understatement!!
Man of the first half!!!!! - what a phrase that is!!!
If we don't score within 30 minutes, we end losing most of the time.
We are sad , u are changing ur opinion every game
Tbf you have champions league/Europa League along with the prem to focus on. This could be a blessing in disguise.
Klopp would wanna change thing quickly already out of a cup! If this was Rodgers every1 would be calling for his head! Klopp is like Wenger hasn't a tactic up his arse knows how to play 1 way fucking bullshit this is I'm already fed up with this season if we don't win our next 2 games klopp needs to go
I realized i feel bad for Coutinho for staying he deserves to play with a better squad and a better manager..should've let him go coz looking at out current situation we ain't winning shit with this clown
Hashtag of the day #20times
Best attack in the league 😂😂😂
Thank you for the 40 million! Ox is the next Stevie g
Go fuck yourself Chris you're a twat, three days ago you're calling for fans to stay patient with the team now listen to you and look at your headline. Kill yourself
Give klopp till the end of this season, if we dont win anything or get top 4, he has to go, getting fed up, fuck all has improved since Rodgers
MANE GOES OUT AND IT ALL GOES TO SHIT, AGAIN.
Never seen such a bunch of nearly-men as Liverpool. Still living off past glories after all these years.
Liverpool destroyed us first half with us only having 26% possession and no clear cut chance, we are used to defending with our backs to the wall and even won the league doing exactly that but even all us in the crowd were thinking ur goal was coming... You were unlucky tbh. That shocking corner (1 of many lol) by Ox that was MEGA powerful near post that managed to potentially concuss Ulloa was the difference as it forced GRINji Okazaki on and the energy was injected into us. Iborra was excellent second half, as was Dragovic both on their debuts. I thought you reds fans were another level of brilliant last night btw, to all you reds fans who weren't there last night they done you proud! They were noisey, well behaved and packed the away corner... You should be proud!!! We were lucky to win last night as it could've been 3-0 at half time, you reds fans shouldn't be too disheartened though as at times you played some PHENOMENAL football and we couldn't cope, you were just unlucky last night. We go again Saturday evening and no doubt in our minds you will give us a ridiculously tough time. All the best for your club for the future and hope you get the results you deserve.
Before blaming Klopp, it's important to understand why we didn't strengthen the defense. It could be because FSG were unwilling to spend (most likely scenario ). However if it was because we didn't have a list of targets then the manager should be held responsible.
No blaming the fans this time eh?
Gone from gerrard as a captain and a player to Hendo .
Klopp flop

When was the last time yous won a trophy? 😂😂😂
Klopp out,Wenger in
'Didn't want to win that cup anyway' your first few words Chris. Sort it out, it's a cup, if you get to the final it's a day out for the fans, everyone else in the pub or at home watching with your mates and family, everyone gets a buzz including the players. LFC was built on winning and winning trophies, it make you a better player and want to win more.
Who gives a fuck it's entertaining that's all that matters I don't care if we win lose or draw it's entertainment I'm after, that's why I spend my money to watch them
What a performance by the Ox. I’d say 40 million well spent 😉
stop over reacting, frankly Liverpool are an average club and as such will only attract average players and managers. Sure you'll do ok this season, just don't expect to win anything cos you'll be disappointed.  (southampton supporter with realistic expectations)
Holy shit!
The lady actually gives a shit and this is how people repay her?
Surprised the kids were traumatized and crying you'd think they'd find it funny seeing as how kids are into poop and other gross things, and if it was a boy he should've been fascinated seeing a female's private parts I know I would've been turned on if I was him. Also surprised they haven't caught her yet she does this once a week in multiple people's yards and public places they even have pictures of her they should wait for her to show up and keep her there until police arrive, and if she's done this so many times even in front of kids she clearly gets off on it the police shouldn't hope she stops before they charge her if it was a man they'd regularly patrol the area and wouldn't hesitate to charge him with indecent exposure.
Me, Tina, am mad pooper.
What a time to be alive.
The anchor is a very handsome lady!
She needs to put on a adult diaper if she can't control her bowel movements.  She should also go see the doctor about her uncontrollable bowel movement.
Lmfao!!!!!! There make an ism for it before long, shitism!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I agree with what someone said on here, once you know her address, the whole neighbourhood should club together and take a steaming dump on her doorstep and all on her lawn!!!! If you can't beat them, join them!!! 😂😂
Why the fuck do you censor the one thing you are filming? That's boarderline fucking mental.
I think it is Paula Radcliffe.
Don't snitch- tell the cops you didn't see shit.
the whole neighborhood should go to her backyard and poop there
I think her name is Winnie, dirty girl.
Don't shit where you jog.
I thought zeke was the mad pooper 😂 😂 😂
What's with all that brown stuff lying on the ground oh yeah that's all the shit i beat outta ya
Sounds like the neighbors are steaming mad about this mad shitter. LOL! Where's Mr Mackey from South Park when you need him?
Voluntary encopresis is less common in adults, although it can and does occur in adults suffering from behavioural problems and serious psychological disorders. The condition is sometimes seen in elderly patients in the later stages of dementia \n\nRead more at: https://whatispsychology.net/what-is-voluntary-encopresis/
I'd push her shit right back in with my dick.
She has been at it since 2013. Topkek\n\nhttps://youtu.be/3tD4nmw1yZs
In India this is considered normal.
I was out jogging yesterday \nAnd stood in poo \nI sat down on a bench to clean my shoe\nWhen along came another jogger and stood in the same poo\nI told him I just did that\nHe then began shouting at me and throwing poo at ME
What a Shitty thing to do...
Get a high speed 4k camera and post her high def picture on Facebook.
really, right here in front of my k̶i̶d̶s̶ salad
I need T.P. for my Bunghole ... is she the wife of The Great Cornholio?? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCutOI9F8Ws
Here's why she does this; the guy in the video brings his dogs to shit in her yard and this is payback. I know this because I do the same thing to assholes who leave dogshit in my yard.
What if she just really had to poop?
Green apple trots!\nThis lady who keeps leaving chocolate bars in the same yard? Maybe this mother of two has a husband who has pissed off this lady?\nhttps://youtu.be/3tD4nmw1yZs\nThis is a very similar story!
Sounds like she has a shitty motive behind her actions
Jesus , what the f is wrong with that stupid woman , put her on a treadmill  in a mental institution, she is not right in the head , something wrong . Maybe she  thinks she is a dog ,
Sounds like a granola liberal. Her body is regular, but her mind is not.
You know what would stop the depravity is you have someone either setup an electric zapper in a spot that she has or would defecate on that would knock her on her ass.  Or a shot to the ass with a paintball / airsoft bb at 250 fps, I'm sure she would definitely get the message not to shit on my lawn again.
Everyone is fighting about people using the restrooms that make them feel more comfortable, apparently she feels more comfortable in the great outdoors.
My gawd, does she have a serious case of The Runs? \nIt is disgusting what Democrats will do anymore.
Well, this is such a shitty situation :(
too much fiber in her diet...
I wonder if that family has a dog? have they let their dog poop on that woman's yard?
We should all be doing the same! SHIT POWER!
She's stupid, guys would pay for her to do that on their chest, at least make money off of it, sheesh
lol. come on, somebody catch her. Joe Kenda, come out of retirement and nab her dude! I mean, you solve murders, surely you can solve the pooper predicament.
What a nasty ass broad. I'd spray her with a hose and shove her face into her own pooh. Makes you think how this woman lives at home.
Her kids were crying after seeing someone poop? the lady is definitely not right, she's OG af but nasty, but the family who's bringing so much attention to it is probably equally as misguided in their steps, mad pooper lmfao
She is shitting on lawns and her dog is using the toilet... weird shit...
This just in  - she was caught with the letters a,e,i,o and u  in her back pocket . Claims  she was having a vowel movement
She must be a lunatic. Quite scary actually, she looks just like a normal runner, and in reality she's a crazy poop maniac
It is not new. American women have some how developed this habit years befor. Here's and example in this link of 2013.__ https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3tD4nmw1yZs
She needs her ass whipped for real!
IBS is a mafq. You all are insensitive, racist, intolerant Trump lovers.
She don't give a shit... well nvm XD
people like that don't need a doctor or a fine from the police, but a good beating, because a beating is the only medicine\nthat helps against this kind of trash. And when that doesn't work, then that means you didn't beat them hard enough the \nfirst time, so the next time you should beat and break something in their body. Then i'm sure there wil be no 3th time!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tD4nmw1yZs looks like the same woman.  Maybe contact NM police, guys.
I  advocate a simple basic West Virginia solution..... Get yourself a 12 gauge shotgun.  Fill it up with Rock Salt and Bacon Rind.   And the next time this skank takes a dump on your lawn---aim it at the bulls eye where the Good Lord split her and I SWEAR she'll NEVER do it again!   And she'll also jog a little more faster!!
I came here for the comments :D
The grizzled detective squats low to the ground to survey the crime scene before squashing his cigarette in the evidence. Well, I'd say it's pretty open and shut, a classic case of shit and run.
What the f is wrong with her? Disgusting MF!
I'd spray her with pepper spray and while she's in pain, rape her in the butthole.
Humanity has lost it's shit...smh.
So she already shit in front of the kids, and the cops still aren't going to charge her?  they're just gonna post signs to try and shame her so  she can stop?  White privilege folks. If it was a brownie or black they would've been hunted down and not given a chance to stop.
Hey Smokey! I'm not a betting man but from here it looks like you're taking a shit!
She's been doing it since 2013. There's a 2013 news video about this nasty jogger
I bet she's into scat play 😂😂
They've had enough of her shit.
1:27 I don't think that _embarrassment_ will prevent someone from crapping in public.
There is nothing wrong with that, it is natural. if you go to an African beach or Haitian city, it is legal to do it in open public on the beaches or grass.  It is natural and part of the earth.  Plus that lady is white so you know she is not racist or nothing she keeping it real.
She obviously keeps slipping her leash, contact the owners and prosecute them.
Inter-dimensional cable TV at its best
Who the hell cares?
i'd eat her ass after
She's or probably tired of shitty pet owners that don't clean up after there dogs
First of her name,the unburnt,Queen of the Dungheaps and the first Turtleheads,Crapleesi of the Great Grass Sea,Breaker Of Bowels,And the Mother Of Shits.......Shit is coming.....
Is this the same woman from years ago???\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=3tD4nmw1yZs\n\nThat's 4 years ago in New Mexico.  Did she move away but bring her sick habit with her?
Someone beat the shit out of her

Public defecation charges. I almost shit myself laughing.

If you can breast feed in public, you can shit in public
She's acting out a TV show. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mILARKuqbs
Geesh folks, every problem isn't a nail. Grow some testicles/ovaries and some compassion. Instead of complaining and threatening to get guys with guns (police) after this person, if 30 people donated a DOLLAR to a crowd funding campaign, it could probably buy a bucket toilet and some buttwipe to remain at her favorite crap holes. She could be suffering from IBS or any number of medical causes. Are 30 people mad enough at the Mad Pooper to come up with 30 bucks or do you want to keep paying $30,000 a year for the State to do it by force? Quit bitching and solve shit peacefully, is all I'm sayin'...
Shit white people do.........
treat this whore like an untrained animal.... shove her face in her own shit..   then a barrel pressed against the back of both knees firing forward blowing both patellas off.   bitch wont be running then.  ever
old white women joggers look like they stink
The Jogging Pooper was clearly a Hillary voter.
she probably a mentally retarded lesbian
Nothing to worry about, Just the next step in the evolution of the SJW leftist mind set.
She looks like she has an eating disorder. Laxatives maybe? That's a terrible way to live, knowing you are disgusting and still continuing anyway. Growdy.
She probably just has a medical condition, but doesn't want to let that hold her back from being physically fit and getting her jog on.
Disgusting and deplorable. I'm guessing she voted Trump. Gross.

Expelled is practically one of my favorite movies and I can't believe that was his first time seeing it all the way through
cameron is such a genuine cool guy he'd be so easy to be friends w tbh
Just think how did they take the shirts off?!?!?!????!!!
me and Cameron have the same last name!
I don't like these vlog videos go back to normal or another channel
The fact that they still glorify their gangs by wearing their flag is just pitiful. Get out the life it's what is killing millions of black people. I'm sorry but I can't hear a word their saying because the stupidity they reppin is drowning out any sound.
Spicy mac and cheese! I need that!!
Bra this is super dope big up
He is this ? Chingy and shaq
This is so dope, unity is the key, lets work together and generate profit. time to build IN, and FOR our communities. We dnt need any more of our brothers blood spilled
The bandannas were necessary, I respect their hustle and hope they inspire other gang bangers to put the guns and get money the legit way. But I guess they had to make it visually stimulating for the viewers.
Damn they need to come to atl w the food truck!
C Tha God with another incognito positive message to the people. My man been making it happen behind the scenes, giving platforms to people who would otherwise never get it. Much respect to the man.
It's clear these two niggas be on some gay ass eating and fucking type shit too!!
This is why people make fun of yall.. Fucking idiots..
There movement is amazing for the City. Salute to these brothers
I kinda like the concept, especially if the food is good ! 🙈😋😍
Nigga in the background was not feeling it lol
I been fallowing these dudes for min. Shits real. Man y'all do ya thing.
See, THIS is what's up. Something positive! If they open something out here in NY, then I''d definitely be a customer. The food looks pretty good on their Instagram.
🔴🔵🔴🔵🔴🔵🔴🔵🔴🔵🔴🔵\nHONOR & RESPECT AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL!
Salute to them brothas. May blessings and prosperity be permanent residents in ya lives !!
Angela a fool for that  Booking' comment lmao
I Know the white man piss lol
i  hope  4  nothing but success 4  these two
Lmaoooo!!! Mane I JUST met Spank last week at this event out here in LA. I had no idea he did this but he befriended me right out the gate & showed love just cuz I'm from Memphis. Dude 100
Colorado is a food desert for real
Look up the episode of My name is Earl, where two gang members came together after beefing in prison but they turned out to be lovers.
we can only hope & pray the rest of the gang types get tired of the life & go legit ......
First time in history that Angela didn't have a friend for this situation
Respect ✊ this is what needs to be promoted way more than the regular trash in the media &a the entertainment industry please !
Black men in California has always been trendsetters..\nGood stuff bro

Love these guy's story...
nigga out here killing and then start cooking while the nigga laying there dying!   *HEY NIGGA!  YOU ABOUT TO DIE!!! YOU SMELL THIS FRRRRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIED CHICKEN NUGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGA!!!!
I'm all for gangsters turning their life around but why continue to glorify the culture? Maybe it's their selling pitch but if they're promoting unity, why show up with different color bandannas?
Ol' boy sittin' behind DJ Envy look like got up too early. 12:26 in, and he either bout to fall asleep on the spot, or done already got blowed befo the show.
It's dope that black men is feeding they're own community. Plus it's actually real food, not anything chemically processed.
in the donald trump era this is a great thing. i never knew or understood why we segregate ourselves anyway.they make a law ending segregation and we refuse to let the law go into effect. that should be donkey of the day everyday.
As funny as this is, no one is ever going to get down with a gang-themed restaurant. Get a diff theme.
you still in kitchen booking ?? yeah yee knows how it go down true home girl.
Why when you get around them “folks” you switch it up....But come on the Breakfast Club & cuss up a storm

For this to be complete, Badnews needs to change his name to something more positive...say for example GoodNews. Words are just more than words.

Son Heung Min seems like a legit nice guy.
Wait I swear most Tottenham players have said eric dier has a bad dress sense
best fashion sense - Eric Dier (nominated by himself)
Eric Dier He Should Be The Fashion Fail

1st
Who the even fuck is this
This shit is so repetitive now
Hemung min son what a marvellous name.
i press like because the soundtrack
Why are they only interviewing spurs players everyone knows their answers
Lamela wearing loubs how is that fashion fail
Get players from different teams 😪
Tubes looks so awkward interviewing people. Big babboons red arse face on him
has he ever got u? nah never
3:12 is CREEPY AF
Do 1 with pogba
You have could have interviewed any other spurs player and u choose eric fucking diet. This guy's personality is equivalent to a brick.
Arse fans disliked
Do more teammate 2.0
Funny is that everyone says that he is the fashion fail
Mad
Hugo son! Hugo son! Hugo son!
I'm getting San Andreas vibes in this vid ..
I like this series but I'd like it even more if you didn't just do it with players that only play for spurs
Most underrated player in the league is Dembele
sunshine
2nd
Tottenham's next game will be a nightmare.
Subscribe for exclusive football content
I got an advert with Eric dier in it b4 the vid Lol
Footballers are so un-interesting off the pitch
anybody else notice Eric's voice break
Does anyone know the intro music? I heard that before ages ago
This cunt comes from where i live
That guy that ended up blocking the road, if he survives is gonna get such a beathing by the other blokes 😂😂
Where did this happen? Location?
Truck guys die?  Seems like they should have just run up hill...
Just sitting over here wondering why this is happening\nEdit: I’m dumb
I hope that guy in the truck is okay...
Am I the only one annoyed that people thing the thing blocking the road is a tractor?
Omg, I hope all those people are ok
Big ass tractor blocking the path is an example of Murphy's Law at its finest.
In these tense political times We should all come together to appreciate that this video wasn't filmed vertically
my disrepect to all of this little whores - thai people & other shit
The guy trying to move the giant tractor to save some money almost got everyone killed. Idiot.
lmao at the guy in the tiny truck honking his horn.
guy in tractor jumped out at 0:06
It's like if the Earth had really bad Mexican food the night before
Laos is depending on China and so the dam must be constructed by China. That's why.
Good luck trying to outrun it or drive away.  Run up the damn hillside next to you.  Ah well, too late.
Eye Dee O's Me Oh
WOW! CGI is really good these days! \n😁
This could happen if Your Mom has a period.
lol at the guy honking his horn, yup thats right buddy, honking will make it magically move faster, meanwhile those guys on foot are allready safe.
If the stupid motor grader hadn't been in the way they could have escaped
Why did the dumbasses get in their car and go... nowhere?\nIf the camera person was on higher ground, then I'm sure they could have raced towards higher ground instead of jumping in the truck and then get stuck.
My toilet after a night of to much ciroc and mcdonalds
lmao that guy that left the tractor running blocking the road LOL he said fuk that sht i just work here PCE
The dude yelling and hootin says it all !
wow way to park a road grader in the only escape route, asshole in the red shirt. sure hope one of the people you killed was your boss cause otherwise you are in trooooouble
0:05 The guy leaving the grader in gear should be put on trail for his hideous act. What a complete moron! According to the news, no one was killed in this accident - but that was more luck than anything else, this idiot didn't help the situation.
I rather die in the mud then listen to this awful shrieking voice
No offense but i really thought the title said jiberish
LAVA IS RISING, GET TO HIGH GROUND!!!
FOR THE HILLS, BOYS! RUN FOR THE HILLS!!
Lol...i just saw this on the daily dose of internet lol
Words canno... stupidity... two drivers...even in the moment...I can't...Darwin...incredible.
Anyone else scream RUN from the first look at the video? And continued screaming until it was obvious that people died?
Why is everyone here unrealistically stupid? That you could go faster off of that tractor and let people through without it walking away but now he just had to back it up and block the only way out for cars and trucks
This woman is literally hollering like a monkey 😂😂😂
retarded fucking women all they do is scream for no reason when theres trouble
He is warning of Pizza and Bear Monsters and to vote for Bernie Sanders.
O shit that's a lot of chocolate milk
Get out of the tractor, get in the truck and go....better yet, don't run down the road..go up the hill.
Wtf I didn't know they had chocolate rivers in Laos
Меня больше всего удивляет как они неторопливо выезжают, че потоп обычное дело
(((Homosexuality is an abomination before a Holy God. If they dont repent and stop doing this sinful act they will not inherit the kingdom of God. Are they going to be lovers of their flesh more then lovers of their God/Creator??? And here is the scriptural Proff in the scriptures)))...  \nThen the Lord said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sins so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me, if not, I will know. (Genesis 18:20-21). Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-Both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to lot, Where are the men, (Two Angels), who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. (Genesis 19:4-5). Get out of our way, They replied. And they said, This fellow, (Angels), came here as alien, and now they want to play the judge we'll treat you worse than them.  They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, Get your relatives out of here, Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. (Genesis 19:12-13).\n\nDo not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).\n\n Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).\n\nGod gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).\n\n Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).\n\nThe look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).\n\nJesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).\n\nThey will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).\n\nSee Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.\n\nJesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).\n\nAm I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).\n\nJesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).\nJesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).\n\nTopheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  \n\nJesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).\n\nThis is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me.
That guy on the grader should be shot. Bailing and blocking the road.

At first I was like oh shit their river is going pretty fast. Then I was like why they running. THEN I was like oh the water is going a bit crazy. THE THE FUCKING MUD MOVED CARS OUT OF THE WAY?! I'd run faster than a black guy in a horror movie

Tomb Raider: The quest for missing Boobs
Now they do it while I'm gone killed me 😂😂
Congrats to Jeremy for being on trending
Do a review on the punisher trailer
I want more Gipsy and Danger
Well the first movie was based on the original game, makes sense having the remake being based on the remake of the game, its just the main actress doesnt strike me as lara croft at all
I can't watch it without Angie. Sorry. & she would have still looked great for the role 17yrs later
I don't see any action star like Jolie in Hollywood today. I'm sure she's a good actress but you can't be Lara Croft without being badass first. So yea, I don't have high hopes.
You lost me on your dogs mate, they shouldn't be shitting on your floor 'FullSTOP'!. Take em for a walk. Love your stuff man. I breed and train dogs. Can help. x
she looked bored. nothing in there excited me. even the ending with the two guns didnt feel intimidating. and they used the guns from the original movie.
Have you watched the borderlands. If not watch it and then review it
the new punisher trailer that recently rolled out is bad ass, more worth it than this bore of a trailer
Is there some deep meaning and incredible plot to the Tomb Raider story that I'm missing? When has it EVER been about anything other than a hot chick kicking ass?
The trailer should of been her locking the butler in the freezer, that would peak my interest.
Well they played all the good parts in the trailer. I don't even need to see the movie.
She doesn't match lara, looks a bit too ordinary and plain and also out of character. Her face doesn't match the character.
Man!\nWhy do you brain wash me all the time! :(
Damn I was so excited for thia movie after the reboot prequel game that was freaking amazing, and then they cast vikander who looks so much like a young Lara, and now they're just making a bland action adventure movie that is nothing like that game
Don't judge a book off its cover
Not saying the movie is going to be dog shit while slipping in a reference to dogs shitting.\n\nI see what you did Jeremy.
Best part of this video is the T-shirt....
Calm a Llama Down\nCalm a Llama Deep down, in the Ocean,\nBlue like a Barnicle\nSitting in the Tight Place,\nLaughing like a Monkey Arm,\nPulling like a China Boy,\nKadaway Kadaway Kadaway\nNOISE\nBoing Chi Kah Masala\nBoing Chi Kah Masala\nOhhhhh Tooth Tooth
It looked like a generic action move. Nothing special.
Did nobody else notice this movie is based on the latest two Tomb Raider games?  The weapons, the costumes, the shipwreck?  Those two games reinvigorated the franchise so of course this won't feel like the old 90's series or Angelina's movies.
I thought on one hand it looked like the new origin game but on the other hand it looked like complete shit
It looks so similar to the game recent reboot - I'm thinking why even bother. The game was great, just leave it be.
Your shirt is better than all video game movies so far.
Netflix Punisher trailer!!!  WOW!!!!Thats all im  saying.  Oh and yes to the guy who made the comment to use c.g.i. in order to make triangle boobies on the new Ms. Croft.
I knew this movie would be bad when they passed over Gemma Arterton for Alicia.
Alicia is a good actress, but she rly lacks screen presence - looks dull and without any personality. Physically just doesn't click for me. You see her saying lines and it's like a bad game cutscene.
No movie has ever made me feel more angry than Assassin's Creed. Why am I getting an Assassin's Creed feel to this movie?
I didn't see the trailer so I don't have an opinion. Probably won't see the movie because I just don't care. Why am I here? Gotta do something while making a poopie.
They should have picked that chick from the new games
Then Nathan Drake shows up with Elena at the end of the film.
Looks dece.  The first Tomb Raider movie was good enough to watch and this looks like it could be similar
Here's the point I wanted to make: Obviously the CGI version of these scenes had WAY more value and detail. They didn't even try with this. And oh, her father again? I put my foot down ever since LAU! Bargain bin. But I wouldn't even try to find it there.
more Gypsy and Danger videos :)
I swear to God, video games fans are the most needy viewerbase out there. 100% of details has to be perfect, otherwise the movie is immediately reduced to a pile of shit...
It looks low budget and it has a hitman agent 47 vibe for me. Looks very predictable but the action scenes looks fun though.
Everyone wanted Daisy Ridly to play Lara Croft.\nEveryone is mad we got Alicia Vikander.\nEveryone keeps forgetting we ALREADY have a Lara Croft... Her name is Camillia Luddington and she is one of the best to take on the mantle as the Tomb Raider. Sure she is not the classic acrobatic dual gun wielding babe we grew to love but she is thee most real-life like Lara Croft ever seen. \nBut since we didn't get her for the movie, it's safe to say she will continue as Lara in the games <3\n\nEveryone was kinda disappointed about how the new Tomb Raider game (2013) looked compared to TR Legends - Underworld but look at Tomb Raider now... It's a shiny example of a reboot done right.\n\nSo pls give Ms. Vikander a chance to proove her worth just as we let Ms. Luddington do the same.
I truly believed it was a fan made trailer. By some high school kid who's (much) younger sister looks like a bad Lara Croft cosplayer.
Not sure if it's more of the same or not because I've always avoided anything with Angelina Uglie, but having played the 2013 game I frickin loved this trailer and I can't wait to see it.
I think Jessica biel or the actual chick that does the voice on the new game would had been a better choice .. I just don’t think this chick was good for the role she’s too skinny and in my opinion looks nothing like Lara Croft.. Jessica biel would had done it for me.. this chick doesn’t even have Lara Croft signature boobs and butt😜 yeah I also don’t know about this movie 🤔🤔🤔
The trailer was just Save the world bullshit, Nonsense that every video game movie director feels like it should have.
Did I miss the Punisher Trailer review? Feels like there should be a Punisher Trailer review.... am I being a smartass? Maybe :p
By the way, the best Tombraider actress EVER! a woman with boystrous spirit, a stern, strong and confident manner, and of course beauty, was Rhona Mitra.    google her.
Its a movie adaptation of a game. They usually don't go too well, almost never. Almost
There's an alternate dimension out there where we have a BioShock movie and its amazing.
Thought it was cool. But lots of clichés. If your watching this, then I'm dead. Lara, Surname? Craft
buuut, the story is EXACTLY the same as the 2nd \nlast game ?? Boat, island, waterfall plane jump  >   cmon!
My problem with it is just like you said Jeremy. Instead of authorities he could trust, (cuz I'm sorry they CAN'T ALL be fucking corrupt) he only tells his one and only little girl! The movie's premise is broken right off the bat. In a game, it's fine for the protagonist to be capable of super human feats, saving the world single handed, but in a movie, of this day and age?! Sorry but we've grown up from the 80s, where roided out walking bands of muscle walked through armies of enemies, who like to shoot the ground instead of the guy killing all of them, like it was child's play. No, if her daddy was entrusting it all to her, the dude had enough change to hire some help! Can we just take a moment to see how selfish this whole plot scheme is, father knows he's going to die and his mission is left undon, so he tapes a message to his only child for them to carry on his legacy, AND THEY HAVE TO DO IT! Otherwise the world is doomed. I like the way that Dune of all things handled it. In the book series Paul sees the way to save humanity is through his son Leto and he allows his son top come to this on his own and choose his own path, rather than force his mission upon him. THAT'S a dad.
Because if we can't...... then aren't we any smarter than dogs \n\nJeremy asking the hard-hitting question. Feelsman
never seen the first tomb raiders, ( cause I'm Not an Idiot ) ,but this trailer Looks Awesome as Hell !!!
I think our best hope for a good video game movie is Splinter Cell with Tom Hardy in it.
Not that I think this is going to be great but why would your think they were just going to retell the game story? its been told just introduce her and get her into some new adventure. the first TR movies didnt try to retell a game story and that was one of the things that actually worked for it. in this they've clearly aimed to get the rebooted Lara on screen. a more realistic physique, some one who gets her hands dirty... it should be viewed with a little... oh wait Hollywood CNE get its head around just making _regular_ movies why assume they k ow how to translate THIS to screen. Compare the trailer for this to the trailer of the last game and you'll already see where they've gone wrong.
Oh, Jeremy, I love you so much! THIS is the opinion. Not like some weird nonsense about Alicia Vikander not having boobs :|
I prefer the naive looks of lara from the game.
Hey Jeremy, do the trailer for Ready Player One. Heard Steven Speilberg's doing it this time.
The movie itself doesn't look bad. It seems to have a lot of action and stunts, which is great for an action movie. But it also feels like they're doing the same they did with Baywatch. Using the name of a classic TV show/video game, as an excuse for an action movie just to make more money. For me, they've totally ruined this by casting Alicia Vikander as Lara Croat. I'm not saying she isn't a talented actress. I'm just saying she's not a good Lara Croft, and I think the problem with her is that her features aren't very feminine. Lara Croft is supposed to be a femme fatale. Elegant and badass at the same time. Curvy and delicate, but intimidating. That's why people fell in love with Angelina Jolie. Long story short: Alicia Vikander looks like a little boy with long hair.
I thought the trailer was crap.
wow Jeremy you're a douchebag its a teaser give the fucking movie a chance
They should've just made Jennifer Lawrence stared as Lara Croft, she's the perfect fit for the Tomb Raider
I disliked the trailer for this movie, liked this video by Jeremy. I LOVE how he didn't go all fanboy this trailer looked so cool, she jumps a lot, I'm pumped because action! I'll always appreciate how Jeremy actually has standards and realizes just how predictable the shitty quality of movies that are video game adaptations are. Keep up the genuinely *awesometacular* reviews Jeremy! :D
Could you Review the DC Universe movies, Son of Batman and Batman vs Robin? I myself Think they're Awesome.
Learn to challenge your preconception of what this movie could be, and then maybe you might enjoy it more.
I mean this not to troll or be nasty, but the casting feels way off\nGo look at the thumbnail for the tomb raider trailer\nIs that Lara Croft, unstoppable adventurer who's been through hell and back and won't let anyone get in her way?\nOR, is it a 16 year old dressing up as Lara Croft for a party trying to do her best angry face.\nAdditionally, I know she had some rigorous work out routine to get in shape for the movie, but she looks stick thin.\nAng Jolie looked BUFF in the older films, like she could very reasonably take on any guy in her way \nIt only adds to the feeling that she's not fit for the role
She looks so awkward on the poster and the pose is so weird like what happend to your neck girl?? And the thing is, the way she holds that bow in the trailer looks soooo weak and wrong. Even jennifer lawrence in the hungergames made it look cool.
Your killing the movie industry dude, make people excited watching movies and not be fucking douchebag
Hi, Jeremy, you also forgor that Iron Fist did it and Arrow, and I am sure like 13 other recently.Love the channel and the chanel to tired to google which is which.
Are we not going to talk about how cute it is that his dogs are named after the mech from Pacific Rim?\nI wonder if they're drift compatible
Lara!!!!!! She's called fucking Lara not Laura....
Gypsy and Danger--great dog names. Guess you liked Pacific Rim as much as I did....
Well my dog is pretty smart she rings a bell to go out! And magically eats her bone perfectly down the middle horizontal! Lol
Remember back when her original backstory is she was with some old guy in a tomb and they fucked around for a bit and she found a backpack and it turned out she needed to find some ancient artifact to seal a god away?\n\n\nNow tomb raider = Uncharted with tits and lots of abuse
Is it just me? Or did a lot of what was in the trailer look like an overly dramatic point for point shot of the Tomb Raider remake?\n\nI'm out... not going to see this one. I've already seen it.
It's pretty much the same plot line to uncharted
It looks good to be honest but I wished they explore the childhood, character development of Lara..but the new Lara is Gorgeous!
You name your dog Gypsy and Danger... Awesome.
Looks a little CGI-heavy in some parts, but still looks good to me.
Pretty much every single action piece in this trailer was ripped straight from the first rebooted tomb raider game. And if they are going to start the movie with her being a hardened badass, those scenes won't have anywhere near the impact of what they had in the game. They will just seem like typical flashy action pieces. Her transition from innocent, naive explorer into hardened, badass killer is what made the rebooted game so fucking good in the first place. I'm holding out a little hope because it is just a trailer so far, but the blatant copy and paste and seemingly starting her off as a badass is worrying
Am i the only one who loved the prince of persia movie?
Such a moving speech
This is exactly the first game lol the game was a lot of fun and awesome hopefully they capture that Bc it seems like a remake of it and not going off and adding shit like others have done
I'm not about to judge a movie before it comes out; Trailer didn't get me too excited, but still enough that I would watch it. Not going to know what I think of the film, until I watch the film.
I actually really liked the very first Tomb Raider, it's campy, but a fun movie.
Easy way to make money is doing reaction or review on something that isn't out yet.
Okay, big fan of the Tomb Raider franchise here and honestly I thought the trailer was ok, just okay, it was basically a teaser trailer. It wasn't perfect, just okay. The father message was a bit bad but it reminded me of the scene in the first Tomb Raider film where Jon Voight (Lara's dad) tells Lara about the aligning of the stars and how she'd have to stop the bad guys from doing what they were doing, only that was done better. But maybe it'll be done better in the film and it was just edited wrong but that's what that scene reminded me of, it was a nice little nod but I haven't seen anyone notice. Now, this Tomb Raider movie is a reboot and it's based on the TR game reboot. For the most part, people LOVED that 2013 reboot. Hell, Casino Royale got criticism because Bond was BLONDE & after it came out, people went crazy over how good it was and how it captured Bond's coldness and brutal kills. So why are people thinking this'll be shit? It's not based on any of the other movies or games, but the 2013 reboot game Lara, that's why she has the bow and arrow and looks the way she does. She's Lara just starting out. Hell, most of the damn trailer was stuff from the 2013 game, her jumping from the ship, her getting knocked out on the beach, her facing off against armed men on the island, her jumping from the wing of the plane etc.\n\nHell her getting TWO pistols at the end is a nod to her using her legendary dual pistols and her using them later in the 2013 game. Damn, people, just wait for it to come out and see how it is. And another thing, Alicia Vikander is hot as fuck, google Alicia Vikander Hot and see how ugly she is lol. And with all the video game movies are bad, terrible or shit, has anyone here seen the first Silent Hill film? That was a damn good film and was easily the closest interpretation to the games even though it wasn't EXACTLY the same. People need to learn to give shit a chance. This seriously reminds me of the Casino Royale thing but it's not Bond's blonde and not enough humor, it's Lara's tits are small and Alicia's not hot enough to play Lara. Smh. Her boobs haven't been big since Angel of Darkness lol.
It look shit
This looks horrible
The trailer looked cliche as hell.
I want that t-shirt
Alicia Vikander looks ugly
That pattern recognition line 😂😂😂
Comments section: 100% about tits.
hey cute dogs
I loved Assassins Creed
Garbage
Thanks for share Tomb Raider Trailer Review
lol I love your t-shirt Jeremy!
LARA\nNOT\nLAURA
Guys I know this has nothing todo do with the channel but there was an earthquake in México City yesterday and theres a lot of help needed if you could spreed the word would help a lot
I’d choke and die if I didn’t drink anything while I ate wtf RIP me
Finally you guys are back! Great new video!
Interestingな動画ありがとうございます！Junさんは新しい英単語に出会ったときどのようにして習得していますか？難しい単語とかだと、なかなか同じ英単語を見かけないのでつぎ見たときには忘れてしまっています😵
水分自体は代謝を促すので、アメリカ人は炭酸をやめたらいいと思います。
Great video :-)
lol I like the shameless plug 😂
usa vs japan = morbidly obese vs skinny fat.
Merica... We want it all
aaaahhh i wanna Eda earings but i dont have holes !____!
who else saw Rachael immediately 😂
murican sodas are 89% ice tho
I honestly screeaaaamed @ the fat bastard cameo
I blame Japan
Great video awesome job!
Love this couple
You autistic
Wack ass plug to shitty jewelry.
Jeez
Spot the foreigner xD
1:51 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Japanese beauty standards are ugly, no offense
Interested to see how Mos Burger size and calories are compared to the American chains. I had some when I was in Japan and it tasted better than McDs or BK IMO.
Where my Vietnam \nNo okay
That looked bad and I was expecting a joke when he said he cooks because there was a cat
If you interested in fast food and health topic, I recommend the documentary film titled 'Super size me'...
My boyfriend is Chinese and his family doesn't drink while they eat either they might have a cup of warm tea but that's it. I always feel odd being the only one with a glass of water.
NO, its not a waste of money!\nYES, the video is awesome!\n💋✔
The eatting out, I absolutely agree with as one of the reason Canada and USA have higher body fat. Like me personally I have to control myself to not buy food everyday. Like I am still chubby. But it baby steps. But it recommend to me by different specialty doctors and my family. I think because over here (I am from Canada) we are way too focus that we don't have time for anything and fast-food is just a quick way to get food. So that might be the reasons. I think that is why over here there is a trend of companies advertising their food as healthy too.
I'm Japanese and I'm fat lol
I don't know how I feel about the Asian guy talking about cooking good food with a cat sitting right in front of him
4:35 that stat seems like bs to me.\nI dont even know anyone that doesnt eat out EVERY DAY
WHAT AUSTRIA IS SECOND???? omg never knew that
Japanese ppl dunt eat out? I have friends in Tokyo and all they do is eat out and they are skinny as hell. As I just realized that's the guys from juns kitchen lol
Wtf in the magazines they look like Eugenia Cooney
I never eat fast food and im still getting fat 😟
is that why there dicks are so small?
yea the Japanese are too busy working themselves to death or committing suicide to care about how much they eat LOL
Ok. Ok. But the revelation that Japanese are apparently sand cat people that obtain all their water from food is definitely news to me.
Belgium was pretty high on that list as well why am I not surprised
Drinking  fluids while eating food will dilute the hydrochloric acid in your stomach
When an American goes out to buy a burger from McDonald's tho, they don't buy just the burger. Maybe in Japan the whole meal is either the burger or the fries or the milkshake etc.
Jun why don't you dye your hair to White or Ash Blonde, then you guys will look like an actual anime couple XD
Japan is closer to committing suicide while America is closer to dying of obesity.
everything is smaller in japan even their wee wees
It's the sugars that make you fat
still waiting for that  twerking video
Well we can blame JJ Watt for eating over 10000 calories a day.
Jun weighting 250lbs is freaking me out. Like, how? I know he’s tall, but I expected 100lbs less than what he is. Jun’s got some hidden meat on him. 🤣
Another thing to consider about the cup sizes, is that Americans love alot of ice. I fill my cup completely with ice cubes, then pour in soda. Most other countries don't put as much ice in their drinks.
You guys hit trending. I'm super happy for you
5:17 look there playing with dinner
It's also illegal to be overweight in Japan. You also failed to take into account ice in the cups that take up a lot of space.
North Korea is one of the thinnest countries in the world.
OMG Jun's so hot i can't
When u wanna buy the jewelry but u only have like 3 bucks
It's no secret that Americans are pretty fat. We are also possibly the laziest people out there.
Thanks for caring about what happened in my country +Rachel and Jun there's a lot of wonderful people united helping right now ♡ and I hope the same thing for our brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico. These are times to be together and try to stay positive, thank you again.
I feel like Japanese people do not drink enough water..
I usually chug down a McDonalds large drink in 5-10 minutes and get like 3 refills
Lol that segway at the end
I thought you were going to show us how to cook cat at the end
I like that when he was talking about the cooking channel there was a cat on the counter hahaha.
Most people in Japan don't eat out more than once a week?? 😳I'm a bit surprised by that considering how super packed EVERY CAFE gets like EVERY WEEKEND. I guess a yummy drink doesn't count as eating out...?? 🤷🏾‍♀️😂 It's okay Japan. I'm a secret fatty too. 😂😂😂 #foodie
I know y’all didn’t leave there without them filling up them fries
When I saw the video post, I wondered how you were going to pull off both sets of fast food! The graph and edit was genius!! Great video guys :)
ahh, Americans eat out more than the Japanese? You should compare Americans to the Hongkongnese. The Hongkongnese eat out every day.
体質的に日本人は細くないといけないんだよなぁ

CONGRATS ON BEING ON TRENDING!
My family rarely eat out anyway 😂 \nWe don't like it as it's unhealthy
This is awesome 🙌🏼 you two are the best and make these vlogs super helpful while adding a touch of comedy as well, greatly appreciated ☺️ also love Jun's kitchen and please add more recipes soon ( side note I got a kitten after seeing your vlogs .. I uploaded a video of Kitty on my YouTube  ( that's his name ) 💟🐱\nkeep up the amazing work Rachel & Jun
Both are filled with weird people.
This was fucking awesome! I expected a dull comparison video having meals side by side... But, you're coming out with observations about average body mass per country; putting both countries' size into context along with their idealized physiques along with differences in culture. And you're even analyzing discrepancies you found. \nBrilliantly done, you two.
Some of your stuff is off. Almost all fast food restaurants fill the cup at least halfway with ice therefore giving less soda. Also Americans tend to work more than any other country. We like our playtime and our fast food.
0:47 I don't get this scale. Isn't Mexico also known for having people. Mexico is next to Qatar.
This statistical evidence is highly misleading. Averages are not resistant to outliers. If you have ridiculously high calorie intake by a few people (i.e my 600lbs life) that skews the data to the right. The median value is much smaller and is resistant to outliers and in this case is more appropriate to use.
I subbed to your cooking channel but you never post videos.  You gotta post more videos cause I love Japanese food
1:06 kill it and burn it with holy water and then with the flames of hell
It just seems like Japan is thinner, but not more fit. A lot of the food is just as unhealthy, if not more so, but they eat smaller amounts; which makes them visually healthier, but not really physically.
For those of you confused by the amounts of calories, this is from the wiki explaining the numbers.\n\nFood consumption refers to the amount of food available for human consumption as estimated by the FAO Food Balance Sheets. However the actual food consumption may be lower than the quantity shown as food availability depending on the magnitude of wastage and losses of food in the household, e.g. during storage, in preparation and cooking, as plate-waste or quantities fed to domestic animals and pets, thrown or given away.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_food_energy_intake\n\nAccording to the Natural Resources Defense Council, Americans throw away up to 40% of food that is safe to eat.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_waste#United_States\n\nActual average calories consumed could be as low as 2280. (3800cal x 0.6)
We'd still kick their ass in WW3 if they fucked with us
The capitalism at the end 😂😂
Japanese people just can't afford Eating
0:37 Foreigner found! It wasn't hard 😉
Who else thought he was gonna eat the cat at   The end😂

No thicc. No dick. \nThink of one Chinese girl that you wanted to Netflix and chill with. U can't think of one. They're not thicc. It would be like holding a stick.
0:37 Rachel, is that you in the middle??
Damn Africa is fat? I thought they get a daily mud and Xbox 360 for lunch
I think this has more to do with food being more expensive in Japan than people's diet. All these imported foods surely cost more and if it makes the Japanese feel better it's a double whammy.
I live in Okinawa and there are a lot of fatties here. There are plenty of yakiniku restaurants and other all you can eat places. I'm not sure about mainland though;)
hey Americans. You are too fat. please take care of your food. We Japanese take care of our food. and We knows typical American fast food are not good for our health. so I don't eat Macdonald Hamburgers or drink coke. If you want to keep your body health, don't eat too much.
jade is the queen
The original one is much better . I love little mix but this just didn't work. some parts of the lyrics didn't fit. But I'd love to see them together on a new original song
Im the only one who thinks that this song is a shit compared with the original? just my opinion xd
Well, maybe now Despacito isn't everywhere where I go.

Put the burned out candle in the freezer. Wax will pop out x
Love the pink hair it really suits you  I'm a new subscriber love your videos xx
Where is your lovely black and white star jumper from Louise? x
Put the candle in the freezer for 30 minutes to an hour....When you take it out it should have contracted  and will fall right out. I just did one the other day, it took mine about an hour.
I suffered terribly with anxiety when I was pregnant, I constantly had intrusive thoughts about something awful happening to my other children, it was exhausting and I felt so down and unwell with it but I am happy to say, it did resolve once I'd had baby, it did take about a month to calm down once I'd had him but it did stop x x x
put boiling water over the candle and then scrub after a bit to get the wax out!
As someone who uses candle glasses for drinking glasses (poor student life lmao) pour some boiling water into the glass and then set it in a bowl or a sink with hot water until the wax loosens up and you can basically take it out then wash it multiple times
You should be feeling really good for talking about ptsd after birth. It's really important for women to talk about, we want women to have a positive birth experience. Just remember you can do this 🙌🏻
Love this vlog but did anyone feel like it ended abruptly?
an idea for the baby name reveal, you could carve her name into a pumpkin for halloween then put a candle in? just a suggestion x
I think the best way to get someone a good gift is to note in your mind what they want or need. For example, I had no idea what to get my step mum for her birthday this year. But when I visited her she was complaining about having too little mugs, and that they were black on the inside so she couldn't see when the tea was brewed to her taste. I remembered that and got her some cute ones with white on the inside. She was thrilled! For my boyfriend's birthday, I got him a nice sweatshirt I thought would suit him, and a fancy chocolate powder drink I saw him pick up in the store. It was too expensive for him so he didn't get it, even though he wanted to. He also lives outside my city, so he travels pretty much every weekend for 3-4 hours straight to see me (we both study), so I got him a traveling pillow so he'd be more comfy. So if Liam wants or needs new nice clothes, I think that would be the perfect gift!
Velvet Teddy has never looked good on me because I'm Blonde, but Honey Love which is a similar colour looks fab!
I love how your vlogs are such a mix of emotions and discussions about things that you are going through. I agree it is so important to talk about how you're feeling so they are an accurate portrayal of real life. It's why I watch you religiously 💜 love your hair and the kittens just melt my heart! And finally, to get the wax out of your old candle jars, fill them with boiling water and the wax will melt and float to the surface. Then you get a clean jar and a wax melt that you can use as well. It sometimes takes a couple of goes, but it does work.  👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
To get the wax out you just have to freeze the entire candle and it should pop right out!! Love you Louise <3
You have the best sense of humour I've ever witnessed aha
i love the pink hair would love to dye my hair this colour but i dont think i would suit it ! x
Maybe you could get something from Ted Baker which would suit Liam. Xxx PS LOVE the hair
Can I suggest cutting down on sugar it can give you nightmares.  I had to do it with my oldest son he never really has nightmares now.
I want friends that come over to eat drink and do puzzles!!! 😭
Best way to get wax out of candle holders is to put them in the freezer, after that wax should be easy to remove :) Once you've got the main wax out of the jar, you can use a bit of vinegar to get any small bits off the side x
I'd put your candle in the freezer for a few hours, that way you can use knife to pop the wax out easily. You can use nail polish remover to get the wicks out if they don't come out with the wax. Good luck!
More adverts than an itv period drama but still worth it 😉 #mumagottamakeabuck
what about a guitar case for liam? x
I get the wax out of old candles by simply pouring boiled water into them and then you poor the water out over the sink through like 5 or 6 pieces of paper towel. The paper towel should collect the wax so it doesn't go down the sink. You can then pour more hot water back in and then wipe the inside clean of wax with more paper towel. The wicks can be removed from the bottom when the hot water is in there with a knife or something. Hope that made sense! xxxx
When are we going to see Liam❔❔❔
I had to empty loads of candle jars to use as sweet jars for our wedding. The easiest way I found was to stick them in the freezer overnight and then you can pop the leftover wax out if you loosen it with a knife.
I'm in love with you 2 mummy's 😍❤️
Do you guys have air conditioners in your homes in the U.K.?
I love you Louise and you are a marvelous human being! Keep being lovely!
literally saw lindsey kelk in the thumbnail and couldn't click fast enough
Don't know if you got the answer about you candle but put it in the freezer! The wax will pop right out.
Is Liam into cars? You could get him a supercar racing experience, I got my boyfriend that for his 18th several years ago now, you can pick how many cars they drive and what ones - he always talks about how much he loved it! I found mine on Red Letter Days! Hope this is helpful :D
I love mildreds, they do good food and cocktails
No judging here I love puzzles!!!! I was going to get a Disney one too the other day now you've convinced me I really should!!!
This is my favourite weekly vlog yet! I laughed so much at the Home Sense section!xxx
great product and great price. you can use Argan Rain Shampoo safely.  you can thank me later.
My hair is slightly more purple than pink but it's still pretty colourful - can I join the pink hair gang?
This vlog is so pink, I love it :D
Put the candle in the freezer and the wax should just pop out with a knife. I've done it before with melted wax on trays and it works really well.
Why u celebrating Halloween so early? Xx
For lovely positive birth experiences - INa May Gaskin's Guide To Childbirth - this woman is the Florence Nightengale of midwifery and has overseen thousands of births since the 70s, and she makes it all so beautiful, natural, and satisfying.  Also, you have to watch Emily Norris birth video, I mean you'll want to have the baby right on your sofa I promise.
that emma lady seems like a nasty person?
You always apologize for saying negative things but it makes you a real human if it was all rainbows and candy floss I would think you were a phoney, I have an almost 6 year old and pretty much had to stop watching the news once she was born, I can definitely get caught up with worries that are mad. Always appreciate your honesty!
Hi Louise - this'll probably get lost in the sea of comments but I'm 18 years old and I suffer from PTSD from when my fiancé went into hospital and I know how horrible this illness is and how much it can affect you - I think my top tips are to ground yourself and to know you've got over this once before and that you can again!! It's hard to stay positive but it's all about the mindset and you control your own brain - thank you for talking about it I feel better knowing I'm not alone <3
Someone's probably already said this but I put any sort of wax in the freezer to get it out of the container. If it doesn't pop right out after tipping it over, you can use a butter knife to lightly break it up into a few pieces! 😊
How do you tell the difference between the kittens like they are full on identical 😂 (and totally adorable!!!) ❤

A watch??? For Liam???
Please keep the pink hair 🙌
I LOVE you, Louise xx
to remove wax from a candle you should put it in a freezer and then get the wax out with a knife :) never done it myself but i saw Ingrid Nilsen do it in one of her vids
@brummymummyof2 I have a candle filing system as well! I thought I was the only one!
*Liam present* how are one of those picture frames that have scan 1 scan 2 and now I'm here for him of baby pentland and maybe a experience day somewhere
I adore the mad af cat woman vibe you've got going on. This is very #goals
Hi louise, by the sounds of it I had a similar birth of my first child also 6 years ago. I have just had my second baby 8 weeks ago and the birth was totally different and much more of a positive experience. Just wanted to reach out to say every birth is different. Message me if you want to chat x
I could never have children I would definitely not trust other people because they definitely don't have your best interests and your being completely rational about this
I need a video on Emma's candle filling system 😂
LOVE the pink hair. And I agree with Em - you are doing a WONDERFUL job. Also love the mini Si quote at Homesense! xx
Before you put the candle into the jar add a little water to the jar and it pops right out when your done with burning it😁
You with Emma is like the best thing ever! Your joy is infectious!
Wait, I might be completely wrong, but aren't you not supposed to dye your hair whilst pregnant?
I love you and Emma together lmao I was crying laughing !
I absolutely love the fact that you debated with yourself on how to pronounce pecan. Also, my granny always said how you pronounce it depended on how much you paid for them lol.
Very easy, heat your water not to boil, and wait a bit, so it's not too hot... then put your glass jar in the hot water, with the opening up, don't let the water go into your candle area.. once warm,  pour out and or wipe out the wax.  Clean and Done...   love you, and leave all your fears to GOD, he will take care of you, just know you will have a beautiful bouncy baby soon.  And God has it all under control.  love the kitties!
Please make sure you´re having enough omega3!!
Darcy's growing up so much
You are absolutely rocking the pink hair Louise! 😍
I just wanted to say thank you for recommending the Alpha course. I attended the first week tonight with my sister and I'm so glad I went! xo
Put the jar in the freezer upside down for a few hours or overnight. Wax may fall out on its own if not u can tap the wax and it should pop out
Really look forward to your vlogs every week
Louise have you checked at your old house for Zula? He may have gone back. I've had cats who have travelled many km's back to old houses.
Get a bowl and put boiling water in it the the candle then wait for it to melt the pour it out☺
I could buy you a bed with that voucher, then you wouldn't have to sleep on the voucher XD
Louise reminds me so much of Adele !
Louise why don't you try melting ur candle wax over a saucepan of boiling water like you do with chocolate? Xx
You look pretty in these vlogs Louise ☺️💞
Louise u look beautiful and glamorous!!! Especially the the pink hair xx and being pregnant looks fine toooo it's human nature 😂
If you heat the glass and melt the wax...very carefully because the glass will get hot and then use cotton balls to soak up the wax that works for me :)
Boil the kettle.\nFill a large bowl with said water.\nPut candle in bowl making sure water just goes to wax line.\nWait 30 seconds and wax should pop right out with some coaxing with a spoon.\nGood luck Louise.
you look like rose quarts!^^
Awww kitties 🐱
Love love love your pink hair!!!
Best shopping vlog ever!!!  Laughed till I cried!
wheres zula
i had to walk home school in the rain because rain is amazing and loves to start when i don't have pe
I'd love to hear more about PTSD. I haven't been diagnosed but pretty sure I have it. Last year I had an extremely traumatic experience in India and would love to know how you coped.
For candle wax you can put it in the freezer for an hour or so then scratch it with a knife  it should come out easily
Maybe some guitar lessons or accessories??
loool I live round the corner from that Wagamamas in Camden- I cannot tell you how many times I've accidentally walked into Mildreds instead!! Xxx
I would really appreciate a video on your anxiety/ PTSD around birth. I have had hypnotherapy and CBT in the past due to my anxiety and phobias. I want to be able to have a baby but this is a huge obstacle for me. I would love to see you talk about this more and give information on the tools/ resources you're using. Love you vlogs - thanks for sharing x
Louise, put the candle in your freezer overnight and it will come out of the canister easier. To get the sticker off of the glass use dish soap and cooking oil. 🙂
a massive pink haired bellend lmao
Has Liam readed your books yet??
44 MINUTES?! IM SO HAPPY😂💖
10:46 blep
Stay strong dear Louise
lose some weight pig
Hey Louise. Have you ever thought of trying Cognitive Behavioural Therapy? That could maybe help your negative/intrusive thoughts x I admire you for being so open in the vlogs x love your hair!
Counselling? I go regularly so things that keep coming to me & upsetting me can be dealt with before it gets any more. I had postnatal depression so have to keep on top of my low moods.
I love how snake plant in the US  is called motherinlaw tongue in the U.K. 🤣 both cultures know mother in laws are snakes lmfao
Jesus, can everyone relax about that guy? I get that nobody asked for his opinion and that Sammi wasn't checking her reflection or worrying about her looks, but maybe he just tried to be nice, that's all. Sometimes I feel like people aren't being feminist anymore but downright misandrous.
love anthropology!!!
Saaaaaammm, I'm OBSESSED with those earrings! Soooo nice!  And that red lip is everything, especially the particular red you chose matches your skin beautifully. This was a great vlog, and of course, so happy I got my little Indie fix! LOL. Oh, and as an aside: The font writing is too white, and too small; could barely read it.
Indy's face with the caption Pub lunch Terrible service at 2:08 made my day lol😂
Take a sip of water every time Sam says pots\n\nStay hydrated!!!
I've had plants for 40 plus years. You need to buy pots with drainage holes to prevent root rot. Get some landscape fabric and cut out to fit at bottom of pot to prevent dirt from escaping. Also buy saucers to put your pots on to collect water run off. There's a really good YouTube channel called Garden Answer and you'll learn so much from Laura. From outside plants to indoor as well as succulents. I think you'll Really enjoy her channel. Best of Luck! Oh and Indie is scrumptious!
Sam, firstly, can I squish Indy (without hurting her!) bc she’s THAT ADORABLE!!! How can a child be THAT cute?!! I LOVE her!! Also, I know curly hair can be a B and so can London weather, but here’s a tip (I do h&M in fashion & adv, and, I have curly hair!) if you take a few sections around your face, front hairline....and time permitting, scatter a few more pieces here and there..there’s a quick easy way to have it feel more polished (but still wild!). That is, take a smaller iron,  1/2 - 3/4 inch, to match your curl, more or less, and simply smooth out a few pieces-  bang area, front, temple, and a piece or 2 behind the ear (but leave the end out-it’s sexier and will blend well) I shampoo, then diffuse, then curl, and it stays for days-or even when you just want to freshen up the look and not wash it...curl a few pieces! It gives a soft sexy look- I get compliments left and right! You looked HOT regardless (over the lip colour on you!) just wanted to share...in case u were interested! <3
The amount of random catcalling you catch in your vlogs is - well, I'd like to say it's surprising but it's not haha. Jesus. Old men need to quit it.
I miss Jason's cooking videos!!!
I love it when you get excited over simple things. Just a tip about the Mother in Laws tongue plant. This Plant's roots grow very fast and thick. It is known to break the pots!! Its a slow growing plant, however, it will do better in a much bigger pot. Love this vlog!
AGH I get SO frustrated when a guy tells you something like Oh, don't worry, you look great without being asked, especially when it's an older man.  I feel like with younger guys, they should know better so I don't feel bad telling them that I don't really care what they think, but I find it so hard with older/elderly men who think they are being nice and don't realize how intrusive they are.  Instead, I'm stuck standing there thanking them for what they think is a compliment.
Great video i need some plants in my home 🌷

Love love love your new bag! xxx
Love your new handbag animal print is my fav because you can use it as a neutral and it can go with so many different outfits
this was such good vlog! love seeing more of you + Jason <3
Loved coming along to fashion week! Loooved the outfit :))
Hey make sure your pots have drainage holes (or place those small plastic pots inside of them) otherwise your plants might drown/die. Especially the succulents!
Have you seen the cute googley eye pot on urban outfitters website? And they have other designs too :)
i have missed your vlogs so much! <3
the song at the versus show was 'spliff' by the austrian band bilderbuch- they are so so good!
Just an FYI it all you so called feminist. Being a feminist doesn't mean hate for men! Or anything that a men can do a women can do better. It means equality for all! Black, white, Hispanic,  Asian , lgbttq,  disabled, men and women! I dnt when it turned into a man bashing movement .
I love plants too
Enjoying the vlogs but please for the love of god stop using the super tiny white font in your videos. Some people are watching you on their iPhones and I genuinely want to read what it is you're inserting but I really can't. Pleaaaaase.
Sammi: might put my mother in laws tongue in this\nMe, someone with zero knowledge on horticulture: damn wtf she can't be that bad surely
I love your style! You're so confident I love it
I love your phone case where can I buy it! I know it's comme de garçon but where do I get it !!
Please share how you look after a plant... I just killed a cactus 🌵😩
Hi, sorry could is the missing word!  Sorry. ☹️
We are a new family daily vlog channel! Can we please get a shout out to help our channel grow!
Loved this vlog! And you of course!! What song was used during the first fashion show?
Miss Jason in the vlogs, love how real you guys are. I know he is private, but do appreciate his appearances 😀
Maybe people should look at how women are treated in countries like Afghanistan. Then a simple, friendly comment from a man who probably thought he was being nice wouldn't be such a big deal.
OMG Indie's face at 2:07, together with the caption reading 'pub lunch. terrible service'. I died. So n'sync.  Haha!
Hi Sam! Just to say that the &OS earring suit you so well, you look so good in them, with that black top and eyeliner... omg gorgeous!! \nloved also your vlog backstage at FW! \nx
Sam, sorry if this has been mentioned already. Pls could you share where indies high chair is from and  whether you find it easy to clean. Thanks!
Your day to day boring (as you quote) life is so relaxing to watch, btw you look amazing in both looks in this vlog
Love that little round pot with the ridges...I think you should keep it...And you sweatty glow looked beautiful.
Jason eating dry bagels is soo triggering, I used to do that when there's no food in the house 😂😂😂
I really enjoyed this one Sam!! Liked the bits at home planting pots, then feeding Indie, to getting all glam and being at shows. Really showed how diverse most peoples lives are between outside and inside the home :)
You were just killing all the outfits in the video!! 👏🏿 love you Sam😘
You look amazing! I've thought about it every time I've watched one of the videos you've made since you came back from your holiday and now I'm finally writing it 😊 Your new pants with that black shirt and your beautiful hair 😍 Your videos are the only ones on YouTube I watch all of 😅 It just makes me happy... you are so real, living your dream, looking amazing - even when you are not feeling at your best ❤️ and it's a true joy when we get to follow you (almost) every day 😃
As someone who has no clue on plant names... 'my mother in law's tongue' threw me a bit ha ha! Such a great vlog as usual though :)
I LOVE that angel food candle from Anthro! I need to get another one, it smells divine 😍
Samantha Maria, I Loove you! I want to see you someday..
I was worried about you when I heard the another attack in London. Stay safe Sam!!
Love love love the blue jeans you're wearing at the end, I think they look so flattering where are they from?
Where is your black top from (one at end)? Love it x
who else goes to the loo or to make tea when a 36 second ad appears on Sams video lol. okay video see you in a bit.
Love your vlogs so much! I'd really like to see and know jason more but I can also understand if hes uncomfertable
u are an inspiration
Im really getting into plants too! but more terrariums with cactus and succulents they're super easy to maintain. LOVE the pot haul
He saw you looking at yourself and probably thought he was being kind putting your mind at rest. Yes I would of been embarrassed if he said it to me but I really don't think it deserves so much hate. I don't know, difference of opinions I guess.
I just realized how lovely black clothes are on you! 😍 It really suits your skin tone. Could you please consider doing a lookbook featuring mostly black?
Omg I love your outfit 😻 you always look so fly
Your vlogs are really lovely to watch and so relatable. Im not married or have a child, but I feel like I just get you :)
IM IN LOVE WITH THAT BAG WOW!
you are giving me 70's retro vibes with a modern twist....<3
Samantha u r one of the most genuine  n sweetest vlog gers.
Bring the bangs back! You look so good with them! And without but you know what I mean lol
You look so pretty in this vlog. You always look pretty but you're glowing so much... sending love from Trinidad❤️
totally get it Sammi, big highlight for you. well done for getting to this point. your outfit for LFW was amaze, need those pants :)\nlongtime fan x
Yes 😭! I miss vlogs, I've been watching old ones. I feel so calm now thank you girl 💗😌
I am lovvvvvving the dangling earrings on u!! idk how, but they compliment ur eyes!!
I really enjoyed this video, best fashion week that I've seen.
Buy larger pots! They'll die without enough root room - buy one that feels roomy.
You look beautiful as always, but mainly, you are sooooo bubbly and fun that you put a smile on my face and that is why I am a fan, I only follow about 3,4 bloggers as I don't have much time to follow more, so I'm quite picky who to spend time on, you definitely have that something! Love from Greece x
Love everything you wear that statement earrings and that bag 👍😳so nice on you and the red lips 👄 you are so blooming 😘😘😘
I think Jason is starting to open back up to the vlogs lol!
Hello from Canada 🇨🇦 xoxo 😘 I love love love ❤️ your look at the end of this video!!! And those earrings!!! Wow! Beautiful:)
Hahaha at the beginning I thought you said I'm going to put my mother in law's tongue in 😂
I can't see all those captions on my phone. Please, use the biggest font possible! Lol
Omg that guy coming up to you and your fake laugh 😂😂😂 I don't think men realize how uncomfortable they make women when they do things like that lol.
yay maje ... the best ever....if your ever in birmingham selfridges do come to ourl concession  we would love to make your shopping experience a memorable one x

I honestly believe that man was just trying to be complimentary. I'm sure his intentions were innocent.
That was fun to see the Fashion Week footage; right now Vancouver Fashion Week just started too! (Vancouver BC Canada) My daughter is a model in it, and it's a bit of a family event. Fun. Thanks for the vid, enjoyed it!
Shout out to the Vegan activists sabotaging the event due to the all the animal use with skins and furs being used :)

Make a ruler cake plz
Why do I still cry when I see you and hear your wonderful voice?? Why does it hurt so much??\nI will always regret, my beautiful nightingale, that I never had the chanche to thank you so much for being my compagnion through every stage in my life... I can only write it down again, as I did so many times before: Thanks for the songs, Mr.Cohen..\nBlessed Be;\nAlthea )0(
Is this the official music video? A fitting tribute, I could imagine the spirit of Cohen walking through his memories after death while watching this, he left the table, he's out of the game, but the music is still playing on.
I’m leaving the table\nI’m out of the game\nI don’t know the people\nIn your picture frame\nIf I ever loved you, oh no, no\nIt’s a crying shame\nIf I ever loved you\nIf I knew your name\nYou don’t need a lawyer\nI’m not making a claim\nYou don't need to surrender\nI’m not taking aim\nI don’t need a lover, no, no, no\nThe wretched beast is tame\nI don’t need a lover\nSo blow out the flame\nThere’s nobody missing\nThere is no reward\nLittle by little\nWe’re cutting the cord\nWe’re spending the treasure, oh no, no\nThat love cannot afford\nI know you can feel it\nThe sweetness restored\nI don’t need a reason\nFor what I became\nI’ve got these excuses\nThey’re tired and they’re lame\nI don’t need a pardon, no no, no no, no\nThere’s no one left to blame\nI’m leaving the table\nI’m out of the game\nI'm leaving the table\nI'm out of the game
I find that final image rather odd, of Mr Cohen sitting on a cross.  He was a Jew who followed Judaism, as well as being a Buddhist monk.
the only one missing is you
R.I.P Leonard Cohen
Canada is proud of your poetry
This is blowing my flame ...mind blowing !!
Teach the Angels to listen your  b e a u t i f u l  songs!!
♥ Mr. Cohen ♥\nBeautiful song...\nThank you very much ♥
Love the song
Love L. C. . We dont blow out the flame. I can feel it. You my name and you tell me from yor star that you are stell my lover. Kiss from your baby. L.J.
13 people just don't like emotions I guess
So glad I was able to see him i concert a few years ago.I thank you,sir.
Poet, prophet, performer, keeper of our love.  <3
Thanks you for  your beautiful  songs, Thanks ypu for returning a bit of my Tug! I miss you Tug!
And now there's tears in my eyes
You are missed, Leonard Cohen.  Thank you for all you sang and wrote.
All that I can say is... thank you, Mr. Cohen, thanks for the good music and the company.
He is an angel.
i love you, leonard. thank you♥️🌹
Leonard Cohen's continued gift here, to me, appears to be about letting of mind's construct/ the material world manifestation and resting in the essence of It All. This is the kind of death that is selflessness, knowing our True Self, alive in what lasts forever in this only moment at evolution's edge. Truth. Knowing. Bliss.
Rest easy Leonard! You are missed and loved!
What can I say ? \nAn unrepeatable voice, a unique Talent ...! \nHe's a Living Legend !\nHe was ,\nHe is ,\nHe will be !\nForever....!\nVl'ado. 19 Sep 2017
What a voice . So mellow. What a poet. So sublime. Just profound.
This should be #1 on trending , and casey neistadt should be last, or off it completely..permanently...
2:25 And could I ask you, each person to light a match, so I could see where you all are? ... I would love to see those matches flare :')
really dig the video and song. here's a write-up we did about it https://zumic.com/leaving-the-table-leonard-cohen-youtube-music-video
The table has come back, now majestic.
Beautiful song, we love you
did a child write these lyrics
Just like the rest of the greats he's still with us in spirit . Lover Lover Lover.
To all the lovers...!
This is one of the most haunting songs I've ever heard.
Wait, didn't he die?
Wow.  Pure poetry and evocation.  Farewell Leonard, I wont pretend to think I will see you on any other side, but damn, you gave real sound to my life on this side!
May it rest in peace his beautiful soul and may his songs live on.
This was probably one of the greatest birthday presents I could have gotten, Thank you for being you Mr. Cohen. May you rest in peace ❤
I believe Leonard Cohen to be a genius and a philosopher and this simple song very moving in view of his impending death but am I the only one to find some of these images lacking in taste and unworthy? A sort of poor Leonard Graphic moving in the clouds. Really???
It's nice to honor him few days earlier from his birthday
Thank you for making art in this world of misery and bad people. Rest in peace, artist.
Wonderful ! Thank you very much !
Sigh...We really miss you Leonard...now more than ever. But hey...Everybody knows...that.
Really beautiful video, I admit I shed a few tears just like I did the first time I heard this song❤️
I don’t need a reason\nFor what I became\nI’ve got these excuses\nThey’re tired and they’re lame\nI don’t need a pardon, no no, no no, no\nThere’s no one left to blame
Cohen died, his art is immortal
this made me sad at 2 am
God I love this man and his music. I began listening to him when I was 12, I am 43 now!
Just found out  a few days ago he died last December her was a roll model for me. Sad I never saw him live.
<3 thank you Leonard <3 Rest in peace
A true legend taken from us too soon.
Just beautiful!
Happy Birthday Sir.
Sweet video.Missing Leonard
awe!
Thank you, Mr. Cohen! <3
thank you
Thank you, Lovely Soul !
Rest in Peace <3

Repent from sin, Jesus is Lord
Beautiful !!!!!!!
I feel like michael bay directed this
there i was ... hoping for a wehrmacht campain.
Still a few butthurt nerds over CoD WWII still having women and poc in the game because it's not historically accurate. So if you do some research, you'll find that in other countries, women served in combat, as well as poc in the U.S. They were separated but, still saw combat.
When they will finally do a new story line at the Eastern front, Norther region, Italy, Balkans, Egypt, Philippines and something involving other nations? It's called World War II for a reason, not American Hero Campaign 23!
Hey! That's pretty good!
Can someone give a name of the soundtrack?
Oy vey, this will be good!
I saw swastikas like if u saw them
no more wall jumping robots i'm happy yeeaahh i got motion sick on blops 3
How do people not know the difference between in game graphics and pre rendered cinematics at this point...
When graphics are better than real life
1:38 - 1:39\n\nDid you notice? When he hit him with the machine gun, he did not even touch him!
Daym... the graphics and the campaign is too nasty😍
2:01 this is what i like to see!
Best game war ever. T
I have a feeling that cod ww2 is gonna have a great and emotional campaign (probably) just like the one in cod waw
Shut up and take my money! ... Oh wait, they already did... Shut up and give me that game! :D
2017, cod retards are still falling for CGI xDDDDDDDDDDDDD Idiots, that's not CoD WW2 graphic, THESE ARE JUST CUTSCENES. Cod graphic will be 100 times worse like always.
Looks like the zombies and campaign will be better than the actual multiplayer
This Is What I've Been Waiting For!! So Hyped ❤️
tbh Bf1 campaign is so dull and too fast, i hope Cod Ww2 bring something new to me, my last cod is Aw
Get ready for grenade spam on veteran :)
Ever heard of the book Fifty Shades of Grey? Despite popular belief of it being an erotic novel, it is actually a representation of the colours in this game. Story mode is shaping up to look pretty good.
Game looks amazing a cod in recent years that I am Excited for.
You can win everyone \nPeople moan if it's future bullshit or they moan if it's in the past \nMake your Bloody mind up\nNo wonder Activision can't decide straight away what game to make as you half of the people wanting the opposite thing
That’s the best trailer I’ve seen for anything it looked straight like a movie
can we just make a movie for cod ww2 cause the graphics look freaking great!!!
Greece fought 2 its a shame that we didnt get even an honourable mention ;(
It should be well optimized
I SEE A SWASTIKA
i like m1 garand sound at the end
Wasn't expecting that, good job.
So psyched. Finally I can return to COD after years of considering the series a joke
Thats the cod been looking for .....
Wait for someone to get offended that there is no black soldiers...
man too bad new games costs so much I'd get this for the campaign, might play multiplayer a bit but mostly for the campaign
That's more like it. Now just get rid of microtransactions, quickscoping snipers, and pre-teen  squeakers in the multiplayer, and we have a winner.
Im more excited to play the campaign than multiplayer
Bf1 will be always better
Reminds me a lot of Band of Brothers.
this the real cod and not the future shits like last 3
trailer be like Christopher Nolan and the game be like Michael bay.
When will the time travellers come in and give the US the exo suits
Should be a movie
I thought this video has age limitation, but why theres still some kids that got away and dislikes this video ????
History is written by the victor.  Don't judge, without hearing both sides.
Where do gamers find all the accurate weapons
2:02 there, can you people stop bitching now?
Now we just need an Espionage mission in the concentration camp.And a soviet front mission
I’ve pre ordered it the beta was sick
Woah there sledgehammer, a swastika? Oh boy I can see a bunch of people screaming.
Of course, totally centred around the American effort in the war. Who joined 2 years late, and waited for Europe and particularly Britain to suffer, while the Russians nearly buckled under the German onslaught. Even if the game is set on solely the Western front, where are the British? Canadians? ANZACS? No where cause obviously the Americans did all the heavy lifting. People forget that the Royal Navy enabled D-day in its entirety, and that the Empire contributed the 2nd largest contingent of landing troops by a close margin to the Yanks. At least Battlefield 1 had the decency to show that all of Europe and America was embroiled in the global conflict that was Ww1.
Saving private Ryan did it better
looks like i finally like something about this game
Great trailer but the game won't be a quarter as good
Say what you will about Cod WW2 but this is DOPE
Supply drops ruined Call of Duty.
The campaign looks really good. However I can't shake this feeling about MP that just makes me not wanna play it, like it's just meh. Zombies should be good too. I can't justify $60 if I'm not gonna play MP so I gotta wait for a sale 😪
A 2 minute video proves nothing. Cutscenes don't prove anything. Games are about GAMEPLAY.
1:50 did this actually happen in my life time???? we are there I believe. I can't tell whats real and whats not anymore
Good. There's swastikas in the game.
One Good thing that we learn from this video\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThey finally put the real swastikas
why does my man have a tommy gun? huh that explains the snow, didn't know this game was set in Chicago...
Chinese war sword soliders theme is your last chance to competition BF1.
I never watched game graphic like this !! ''O'
Yes I love playing as Americans in every videogame I play
usually I say bf1 wins but when it comes to story mode cod wins every single time
Why does the m1 Garand sound like a laser 😂
I watch it over and over and over again
AH YES THE SIX MILLIONS OF THE CHOSEN PEOPLES WERE KILLED IGNORE OTHER COUNTRES SCHLOMO HEHEHE
I see a old character from advanced warfare the general. So lame and weak
notice how it DOES NOT say in game engine game play i bet this is a pre-rendered demo not the actual game as we already played the beta
Will they include the battle for ittler castle cuz it would be awesome since German and American fought together to defend the castle from the ss soldier
0:55 Well, hello Tom Hanks!
I cant see the videoD:
call of duty homecoming
Cewl
Swastikas!!!!
r.i.p battlefield 🙏🏻

Not Vitamin C, babe. Vitamin D.
Why the fuck is this trending?
I need an anime where Dan is a competitive rower and meets his new roommate, Phil, and learns he's a competitive rower on the one of Dan's rival teams.
Dan's wealthy white boy ass never had to cook dinner as a kid lol
L O N G B O Y
Dang it, I always miss out on these live shows
I was just casually walking down the hallway at school talking to my friend. All the sudden she walked away shouting, Rubber up for Dan!
not a furry but i have a sudden urge to draw dan's fursona
i literrally hate what happened 20min to end because I got sooo drunk I don't remember and I only dreamt of my ex and phil :(
It's not a plebiscite, it's a vote for marriage equality. And optional vote. You don't have to tick or cross the box. You don't have to email it back. \n\nIt's an optional vote. It's completely ridiculous. \n\nIt's ok to vote no\n\nArghhhhhhh
i burn my pasta too...but i put water in it..
I'm waiting for the Panisonfire fan account :)
daniel I'm disappointed. you didn't watch DNA..... lmao jk i just wish you did
I googled what yiff ment......PLZ dont make the same mistake.....XD

'Didn't get probed.''I was violated.'

Wow I've never actually heard someone say AU in english
Was he wearing any eye makeup??
I always get confused when people talk about Rihanna because we have the same sounding name and I am the slightest bit narcissistic when it comes to my name.
guess you could say he's\ntaniel
You are orange!! I don't want to say it but *cough cough* Donald Trump. No!!!!
Hope you are misting your air plants ,they actually need that ,never relaxed enough to fall asleep in sun anymore I miss that..
I died of laughter when dan said the internet is not here
Hello cyber friends
I just want to say, no matter how shitty my life gets, (and it's been pretty shitty) I watch your videos and they always make me feel so much better! Your relatable and make me laugh, you just make my life so much happier and give me something to live for at the end of a tough day. Thank you for doing what you do!❤️❤️❤️❤️
You heard of elf on a shelf get ready for DAN WITH A TAN
Thanks Dan! Everytime you say literally I drink water, so I'm hydrated!
why do you look 18 when you're much older.\n\n\nyou have amazing genetics
you think 900 is big? im reading war and peace online and it's 2882 pages!
Why am I so awkward? The story of my life
God, you're so handsome
It's okay Dan, I'm awkward too. Me and my friend were talking in the hallway today, and my crush mocked us because we were saying made up words so I turned to him and said shmerfermerner. He called me weird. Rip me.
Excuse me... lesbian with anxiety... represents him... I'm fricken dead
I LOVE THAT HE CALLS IS YOHGERT INSTEAD OF YOHGURT\n\n\n\nthat's what I got outta this video..
He is so fucking beautiful and I don't think he knows it.
before i watch this please tell me that he talks about the DNA MV
Personal space *as he closes in the camera onto his pores
i actually like the bushy mess look.
Why am I so awkward?\n\nWhy are you so hot?
Thanks for streaming live WHILE I WAS AT SCHOOL , you little bitch, how about you wait an extra 2-3 hours you cunt nugget so I can actually WATCH IT LIVE , THAT WOULD BE NICE. btw love you so much, but also, die bitch\n\n\nJust kidding guys no need to take this seriously and overreact saying it's not his fault he's in a different timezone \nI'm kidding... mostly
got that D from the big S up above lmaooo
I'm guessing that dan didn't go outside but was tanned by artificial lighting from his computer.
Dan don't worry I once burned water.
I love that he talks about how he shouldn't be on trending and then this video is trending
first four seconds is awkward silence i love it
Definitely go see it!!!
The edges of your face look crisp
 why am I so awkward? Me too dan me too
Why is he so hot I CANT TAKE IT
Did dan get a tan? I guess I rhymed, that's fine. Wow dan.
she is a lesbian with anxiety\n\ndan: i fell represented
I love you, you rat
Dan's freckles are so cute!!!

I love how British people say vitamin!!!

congrats on #11 on trending ya nerd
Why is this gimp on the trending page? oh wait, you have cringy twat fans following you.
Please watch this and treasure how special this man was - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytk5K4GlgaQ\n@boogie2988 I hope you do not mind my linking of your video to this event. You pretty much summed up all the words and thoughts that I had, and still have.
Could you imagine the shock of someone remembering the passing date of Iwata, making the gesture in front of console, and then the game starts all of a sudden!?\n\nAmazing tribute. Fantastic.
This was done in such a slow and painfully formal way it wound up pissing me off. You don't have to move your arms like a robot. \n\nThat said, neat secret.
This thing hit me DIRECTLY to my heart
The last game Iwata worked on was Mario Maker iirc. he left us with mario maker so we could have fun making games like he did ;-;
DUDE SWITCH THE GOD DAMN CLUBS. STOP HITTING WITH A WEDGE. Iwata is turning in his grave with how poorly you're playing his game
...but in my heart, I am a gamer\nWe miss you, Iwata :(
He is the OA
doesnt work for me NOOOOOO i wanna play it
free game behind a dance-wall
on my console it dont work :(
I'M NOT CRYING! THEY'RE MANLY TEARS! KNOW THE DIFFERENCE!
Eh, what? I don't understand how I can do this???
This video is so stupid, thus guy changes the date and makes some stupid moves, why do you dont speak? Whats the problem too explain this..
Good job hitting trending on YouTube . Iwata would of loved this if he was still with us
I'm very confused wtf is happening
I believe it's fake
The sound it makes at the game's boot up clearly says chokusetsu, which is Japanese for directly, in Iwata's voice.\nBeautiful stuff.
i managed to find it thanks
This is some Ready Player One level shit
Oh good now every time I look at my switch i'll CRY
I'm not crying, you're crying ;_;
Wow that's one heck of an easter egg and a great tribute to Iwata!
It's real and I am moved. I don't know what to say.
So can this game ONLY be played on July 11th? Or does playing it once unlock it to play whenever? My Switch is connected to the internet so I can't check it myself.
I cry every time.
Never bothered connecting my Switch to the internet. Reset the date to 07/11. Turned system off and on several times to confirm date stayed at 07/11. Held the damned joycons exactly as video demonstrated. Followed the EXACT motions video did. Nothing unlocked.\n\nEither this is fake, or the person doing this video needs to take a couple of steps back and do this again to show the EXACT motions made when hands fell off-camera.
It's apart of Japanese culture. Basically the inclusion of Golf means he is with the switch and is supporting it. He's seeing the success of his hard work.
I wanna see Etika play this on stream
O mais impressionante é ver o cara fazendo tudo ao contrário, provavelmente com auxílio de um espelho. Que cordenação impecável!
I'm tearing up right here, legit
WHY YOU ONLY HAVE GOT 15 SUBS!?!?!?!?
That is absolutely incredible that it activates through Iwata's 'Directly' pose. best easter egg ever.
flight attendant: thank you for flying with us
You get a B+ as a mime.
does this work for july 11 2018?
have u updated your switch
OKAY. I previously posted a colmebt doubting this claim, but after searching more, I found even MORE proof of it.\n\nThis is fucking real, and that makes me so happy.
I'm gonna cry, this is so sweet
Can you try it with the joycons attached to the grip?
Well, I tried. But thanks for the video.
Wait so you can't do this if you've connected to the internet before?
Nintendo should just make July 11th a special holiday for nintendo fans.
How have I not realized that Iwata died on my date of birth?! I'm... I'm disappointed in myself.
Got super dusty in here all of the sudden...
Got me chocked up a bit.
It is such a sweet easter egg and it shows how much Iwata was a big part of Nintendo and that his legacy will live on! Congrats Nintendo! I really think that is so lovely of you :)! RIP Iwata-San :')
How does someone figure this out
This is truly astonishing\n\nThankyou Iwata, we shall miss you
Now that right there, is an amazing tribute to Iwata-san. Truly beautiful.
Thank you for actually making a good video
This is by far one of the greatest tribute I've ever witnessed.
Are there more videos around? Because it would be an easter egg never to be found if there werent any hackers around.
Fuck, on july 11th if I open the game I'm hesitant to even close it and just keep my switch that way as a trophy.
It'd be pretty odd if the Switch had Golf as a VC game.
I haven't gotten a switch yet. Not connecting to internet till I do this
I can't see the Joy-cons
Huh,,,gayyyyyyyyyyyyyy

Bro i cant see shit
F <3
Directly.
Only Nintendo...
Please understand.
This is fucking beautiful.
RIP Satoru Iwata
I really gotta learn sign language.
Can you please make a video instructing how to do this? I couldn't really see most of your gestures and how you were bending the joycons
岩田「直接！」\n(iwata) (Choku setsu !)
Wow, Nintendo giving something for free. That really is a sight to see.
You have to tap the button three times to swing. Once to start it, once at the left end of the meter to set the power, and a third to swing. Such a great game, so hard to watch you play it.
To everyone saying that you have to wait for next year, logically you don't. All you have to do is set the date to a year in the future while disconnected from the internet. Computers don't have any form of secret master time storage, so if you disconnected the system from the internet, it wouldn't be able to prove that it WASN'T 7/11/2018. Now as people start trying this out, I suspect that we'll hear from some guy whose uncle totally works at Nintendo that it'll only work if you've NEVER connected to the internet, or maybe it'll only work for people of a very specific height or... Who knows?\n\nWhat is the point of a memorial that is never seen? How does that honor anyone? Can we get somebody's uncle who works at Nintendo in here to comment on why a game had specific motion controls added to it if nobody was ever supposed to see it?\n\nBut hey, what do I know? I didn't believe in World -1 until I got there myself...
I will not attempt this now... I will appropriately and respectfully wait for the date next year to do it.\n\nto honor Iwata san. This is sacred.
i cant replicate your motion, i disconect the internet and change the date.... what im doing wrong?
I hope Nintendo updates the firmware for a much easier version of unlocking Golf because I can't do it, even with this guide.
It doesnt work
Faked for views
I can’t get it to work. Help?
Does this still only work on version 1.0.0?
Can you not talk? Why make the video so cryptic when everything could have been explained in 30s of talking?
Dont work for me.
This isn't working for me...
i cant get it to work XP
If anyone can let me know if u can get this to work on firmware 3.0.2 that has been connected to the Internet let me know
In German: Bei mir klappt's nicht!
fake
I'm not a fan of mute videos.
did anyone make it work? I tried but it didn't work.
Someone buy this buy a better camera.
I really don't get this whole gluten thing, I live in Germany and we eat a shit ton of bread, and I never ever have seen a person saying they are bloated because of bread or that they get a tummy ace. I guess a lot of that discomfort comes from processed foods with a lot of shit in it. I always feel like shit after eating a meal at McDonalds or just too much, but never because I ate a piece of bread. I know there are people who are sensitive to gluten or even alergic, but its not that many people. I personally only know one person that is allergic to it and feels and looks a lot better after going vegan. I think the amount and the quality of what you are eating are important and its really naive to think that if you just cut out this or that you will feel better. I guess everyone has to find his own balance of what and how much to eat to feel good by using our brain and informing ourselves at the same time and not just blindly follow what the newest nutritionist tells us. There are many reasons why you can feel bloated or tired like not enough activity, eating too fast, eating processed foods or even eating stuff that the bacteria in your gut like, like onions, if I eat to much onions I get bloated as fuck and then I just fart all the time, just linking it too gluten is not really thought out. Also have you never thought about the chemicals they put on wheat sometimes just before harvest? I guess there are many factors that influence our well being and there is not a perfect solution that fits everybody.
I thought the title said I ACT like Kourtney Kardashian for a week and i was like wtf howww? :D
why she need to fast once a week?? it's weird
How is she dairy free if she puts cheese in her salad lol
No thanks. I'll stick to real food which has actual flavour
Anyone wanting soy sauce, but is GF can get Tamari :)! It has a little bit more of a stronger taste as well...
where did you get the info on the diet?
Do you have mild rosacea? Only asking cuz your cheeks get a bit red!
Try this Tamari Soy Sauce - it is 100% gluten free and DELICIOUS. It has been my go to soy sauce for years, and tastes better than any other soy sauce:  http://san-j.com/products/organic-tamari-gluten-free-soy-sauce
I love your videos too but I do agree with a earlier comment I feel like you modified it just a little too much. Adding cocoa powder to the morning shakes changes it and takes away from the true Kourtney Kardashian morning shake. Again love you and love your videos but the modification was a issue.
Honestly, I can't even imagine what your body can actually handle at this point. You are constantly yoyo dieting, and I feel like you're not going to be okay if you keep doing this.  I'm not hating, because I know what it means to struggle with body image issues, but you need to keep your own health in mind.
@5:04 that LV phone case/wallet..... Happy for your success, but....be real.
Don't you know everyone is Gluten intolerant 😄  prob must naturalists etc will say your gluten intolerant...I say intolerant NOT allergic. I know a couple people that have celiac disease. One was like sick for years and losing weight until he got tested and found everything was caused from gluten. If you actually have Celiac you can/will get very sick from eating even just a little gluten. Reading labels is VERY important and leaning what words mean it has gluten (in ingredient list)
Finally someone else who can't stand tomatoes!!!! Everyone thinks I'm crazy but I can't even smell them let alone eat them!! 🤢
isn't she an adult? why does she have a roomate?
I usually really like your videos, but you seemed very forced and kind of fake in this one. :/
There is a gluten free soy sauce called Tamari
You redid every single recipe. This doesn't count I don't get it?
Why does Kourtney say she's off dairy, but she's eating mozzarella..?
You look awfully old to still have room mates ....
You didn't really stick to her diet \nIt wasn't that exact
I ate like Kourtney Kardashian for a week... but I'm gonna sub out this, or and This, that and the rest.... \n     I would say the title is off putting but could of just said trying some stuff she eats
Just half of an avocado is 300 calories and all fat. It's not very different than just drinking olive oil. Your body and brain needs fats to operate but excess will just be absorbed and stored as body fat.
A good filling breakfast for me is ah egg, 2 bacon strips and...u guessed it...a small avocado!  BTW...loved the voice-fracking...sounds all fracked up!  lol
I do not think that food processor at the beginning was plugged in....
You can use coconut amino instead of soy sauce. Its available in whole foods <3
You say at the beginning that you chose Kourtney because she hasn't been accused of going under the knife but she herself has said she's had breast implants!
I wish I could eat avocado. Glad she isn't afraid of fats though!
Try adding frozen peaches to the smoothie and I find it hides the earthy taste of spinach and avocado.
I found Kourtneys diet in the star magazine and it says she eats every other day and on her fasting day she eats bone broth.
watching & hearing the blender for that morning smoothie was scary!!  PS would be good to add chocolate protein powder for taste & health.
could you try out the hard boiled egg diet?
Omg by 7:30 you actually LOOK like Kourtney K! 😄
no dairy but mozzarella?! :D find the logic....
You have amazing hair and face! ❤️\nHaha love the Kim impression at the end! You're so much fun! ❤️
did u eat human flesh nd drank blood dats wat dey eat too this stupid bitch encouraging others to b like them whores slap urself for me
I love chocolate smoothies with froz very ripe bananas, almond milk, cocoa powder, peanut butter, oatmeal, and a bit of coconut sugar, and sometimes i add froz strawberries. Try it, seriously good stuff.
Probably one of the smartest and most sustainable celebrity diets. I'd like to know more about the rest of their diets. I always see Kim eating burgers without the bun(she might be low carb). I know Khloe doesn't eat red meat. I know Kylie eats pomegranate seeds everyday(I would too if I could afford to). I'm not sure what Kendall eats though. I think she eats at restaurants a lot.
Hey! For future videos, a gluten free, more nutritional soy sauce alternative is liquid aminos!
She's dairy free but eats mozzerella cheese? Is there a dairy free option I'm missing?
At 0.6 I'm like plug it in!!!
Please send love to Mexico, there's been so much heartbreak here lately. And please like this so she sees it.
Since when was mozzarella dairy free? :')
That first clip had me yelling at my screen its not plugged in! haha
*Sips tea*\n\n\n\nI think I'd rather exercise and eat home cooked food thanks. At least I know what's going into my body
Ok but I died with your Kourtney voice. xD
Cutting out dairy, gluten, and non organic is easy and sustainable but cutting out flesh and periods was waayy too extreme! That makes sense :/
I can't stop staring at the moles.
ok i stopped watching coz you basically moified evrything.  was hoping you were gonna go fully in.
Hey Candace! Random question, what steamer do you use? Spotted it behind you at the end of your video. Thanks!
I feel bad that i am eating reese piese ice cream while i watch this
i have never met somebody that hates tomatoes as much as i do. made me weirdly happy
Your hair looks so pretty :) can you tell me what colour they use ?
I really wanted finish this video but your pickiness irritates me so much. Why call it I ate like kourtney kardashian for a week but seriously changing something is not eating like her...
did you lose any weight??
Well , at Least you're not eating  BLACK COCK like the Other Kardashian Whores ... \n                  Good for You
If she is dairy free why is she eating mozzarella cheese?
Mozzarella is dairy..
Can you try the IU diet
You're so awesome!! I love you!!
Moserella cheese is dairy...
Kourtneys  Food doesn't feel like it was a diet, it's a more of a lifestyle. \nThanks for doing this.
favorite one so far, not too much talking and more doing, more silly and more laughing - more fun.
There  is gf soy sauce/Tamari. We use San-J organic Tamari which is a wheat free gluten free soy sauce.
Where's the seasoning at
5:05 stump stump stump stump stump
Isn't Mozzarella cheese dairy?
When she said tomato I thought she said toe nail lol
I'm content with how I eat, but I always appreciate when you try out a diet because it allows me to vicariously experience something new.  Just in case I want to add or subtract or substitute.
Mozzarella cheese? Thought she was dairy free.
Mozzarella?  I thought she was non-dairy?  I just quit dairy so I'm being a salty hater right now...
LOVE the different hairstyles
I eat avocado for the healthy fats and stuff.. but I freaking hate it! 😂
Video should be called I sorta ate like Kourtney Kardashian for a week.
Does she have a kid ?
Your kardashian impression was spot on 👌🏼
Future tip about the soy sauce. La-choy brand is gluten free. It's the one I use, and I'm allergic to wheat
You should try butter coffee! People claim it helps them be more focused and energetic throughout the day..
I just lost my £10 🙄😑
Wait... I thought she was dairy free? What's with the mozzarella on the salad?
Hold up mozzarella she is dairy free or vegan mozzarella
Loved all the avocado 🥑
3 minutes your welcome
Do a kpop diet
Intro is toooooo long..
7:15 HAHAHA
How's mozzarella dairy free?
But mozzarella is dairy?
Yeah khourts stuff looks delicious and I'd eat them anyway tbh lol
U should try intermediate fadting
kardashians are retarded
Try Demi Lovato next please!
Mozzarella cheese lol? That's dairy
Mozzarella cheese has dairy...
Are eggs not dairy?
Mozzarella is dairy free!?
dairy free?....You were eating so many eggs !
If Kourtney says she's vegan, but uses honey and bone broth...girl ain't vegan lol.
eat like freelee for a week!
Avocado is basically fat. So I don't get why its a health food?!

Why do we always loose to exo in votings and polls?
Who are they 😍
You would look great with a warm brunette hair color. Your hair would look extremely full too. Dark hair and light eyes are lovely!
Literally cannot relate to this channel at all anymore. Girl bye
Its hilarious how she talks about her favorites and then proceeds to talk about something brand new that she clearly hasnt used lmaoo
am i the only one who thinks she looks like piper chapman?
What is the point of these 'favourites' video? Most people can't just pop to Gucci and buy a bag, shoes, socks and a head band ffs! You're going to alienate lots of subs.
Yessss I live for Gucci! Xo from my channel to your's! <3
guurl i love you and actually bought some of the items you showed in your favorites <3 PS: people let her do what she wants and if you think she is materialistic or anything then stop watching her video and go be sad !
Did your hair day  to be on style mermaid very  chic!
So where does her money come from?
anyone else trying to look to see the pricetags price of the knee high socks?
Omg you lips look so much better now.
You are looking gorgeous! Love the makeup and hair! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
buying a 1790$ bag is stupid
Can you please get ready with Jeffrey star on his PJ
Oh my god, those boots are $1,600.... \n\nI don't know why I even thought I could afford them when I saw them. Haha.
Gigi doesn't care about YouTube now that she has that billionaire money. Too booked to be bothered hunnnayyy!
Since Gigi did her lips she just looks less feminine...
For real thought the cat in the back was my cat. Looked over and hes asleep. Damn that cat meows alot!
No hate but Y  she throwing (almost) everything away > showing how much she appreciate the things  😐😐🤔🤔 easy comes easy goes
Those sneakers look like something I would have worn when I was 12 ... actually probably not even then lol
Why do you always throw your things after showing them
Gig I want a reality show from u I'm talking Kardashian
i watch these just to watch her throw stuff. I've been watching since like 2010 when she used to throw stuff behind her and sometimes break stuff lol.
I don't want to stain this white couch *sprays it anyway*
1:20 Wait.... the bag is blue? Am I the only one seeing purple?!
This is everything. I severely missed your iconic throwing of items!
I'm sorry but I really don't like the hair at all and the makeup looks really bad. Come on Gigi you can do much better. 😡😡
her hair is blended so well
I’m living for this makeup girl!!!! I think I can recreate it with the Jaclyn hill palette by morphe.
Looking GORGEOUS! I love you but you tend to over do the lips but this is perfect! xoxo ps: the louboutin paloma bag would look SO good on you!
I'm obsessed with this hair <3 <3 <3 Giving me major Daryl Hannah Splash vibes <3 <3 <3
you're the man!😁
UGHHH your so pretty I can't stand it!!! ❤️❤️❤️😭😭 Gigi I love you!!
Gigi I'm really feeling your hair and your brows 😍
I'm so jelly she got the whole Candy Johnson line .. I want the giant lollipop products! !! soooo freeking cute 😍 I'm in love 💙💚💛💜
You're so beautiful😍
Why the heck is every damn comment complaining about how they can't afford these products and can't relate literally no one cares about how bitter and jealous you are because she worked hard to get this stuff and money so get a good job and buy whatever u want and quit COMPLAINING
Every beauty guru has said they loved the Lilly Miami lashes.. Are they really worth it?
Yaaaassss I love Kandee! Y'all should do a collab 👯
So for a second i thought there was a person behind the window but it was just the reflection of Gigi's hand with her products. Lol oops😂😱😂
Did anyone else hear a cat meowing a lot lol
I'm so happy Gigi is transgender my life would have been changed
awe i wish i had enough money to be that materialistic
This is not really a favorites video, there is stuff that you haven't even taken the tags off
The way you always throw/toss expensive products around gives off the impression that you are completely spoiled :(
THE CAT WANTS ATTENTION, KAREN
Are those demonic cats I hear in the background???
You are a breath of fresh air! TY
Could you pleeease do another makeup tutorial❓I love you so much and you are a big inspiration 😊☺️😌
This might as well have been a haul video. Tags on everything. Love ya regardless.
The lies in each favorites video I swear... Lol most of these haven't been touched once. Like the too faced products. . .
Gurl no one is buying a tan that August recommended his the next orange trump
Auto fill $350 a day, go girl
I love your eye makeup
I love your monthly favorites and this makeup look.
The only thing I can afford in this video is Mac makeup 😂
Everytime i see this im just like YES GIRL GIVE IT TO ME

Someone click like on this to see if I've been blocked.  Thanks.

Missing your more relatable monthly favorites
so \n*throws the purse that probably costs more than my house*\n\ni love that purse
Instead of posting this kind of videos ! You should post something to help ur Neighbour México ! We need a lot of help please just let pple know how they can help us we are very sad for what happen and we need help !!!!! Please make a difference in ur channel and try let pple know how sad we Mexican are. Thnks for understanding !!
anyone else notice that the Gucci symbol could stand for Gigi
Didn't she used to do storytimes?
That headband is $760. That is a $760 headband. My brain can't comprehend that, probably because my $12 lulu headband is a little too tight.
Love the makeup but the pink lipstick doesn’t go with the eyes
Culture appropriation!!!!!!
Some people are very disrespectful. Children were killed in a school that collapsed. In tragedies like this, people are people. You should be ashamed of yourselves.
Jeez man. Our planet needs a lot more positivity and love.
Is New Mexico ready to rock!? 🤘
Instead of sending white men to do all the dirty work, why don't dreamers go down there and help their own people?
This is why expenditure on infastructure  is important.
This world is going downhill real quick
This is definitely a disastrous year. Is it just me or did all these disasters start showing up after the totality eclipse?
Horrific images! Get you red hot horrific images right here! Not click bait! Get your fresh horrific images right here!
See this is what happens when yall keep making fun of Trump. He is our savior.
I feel very badly for those people who died while worshiping their god who killed them. They could have escaped a long time ago.
where am I going to get my tacos now
California, texas, chicago, washington, and new york are next hahaha. All hail Europe!!
To look at the bright side , Mexico is already a third world country so besides lives lost (which is sad), infrastructure will probably not end up much worse after.
This is so sad prayers goes out to Mexico 😭😭😭😭
I blame white people for shoving all pf them down south
someone play a song by ksi earthquake and this happens...
Lol Mexico didn't help the US with Irma, looks like karma came full circle. Hopefully the US doesn't send any money to this deplorable country.
Bet the people typing mean comments wouldnt say that in real life.
America is using haarp once again.
I hope and pray that they are ok.
So far more than 200 ppl lost... many students from a school that collapsed... people who couldn't leave the buildings in time and are under all the remainings... it's very sad but everyone is helping. We've come together in this horrendous situation to try and get everyone out... never felt more proud of being a Mexican
The damage must be in the hundreds of dollars!The horror, the horror.
From Iraq praying for you♥️

Irony is they practice said drills yet still people managed to die. Guess these drills don't do much or many don't bother with said drills until its too late.
Seems like trump didn't like fox's advertising skit
This is a sign of the end times but ya know with all the beefing, fighting, arguing and hatred going around, events like this remind us that we're all human at the end of the day. We all are susceptible to suffering, death, all these things. We shouldn't treat other people like they are anything different from a friend. We all are the same at our core. Short, tall, black, white, Jewish, Asian anything. God loves us all the same.
How did drumpf™ do this I heard on John Oliver®'s show that le drumpf did this 😤😤 make Mexico not shaken again le drumpfstein

Treasonous Trump is s curse .....until America and the world work together to rid him these natural disaster are going to get worst! No Forgiveness!
Let's be honest, if an earthquake would've happened in America, Trump and his Republicunts would've blamed Mexicans for it..
Over 200 dead, over 30 buildings fallen only in Mexico City and damage also in other 5 states.
The president of Mexico offered humanitarian help to the victims of the hurricane in Texas...  Is Donald Trump offering humanitarian help to the victims of the earthquake in Mexico City ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n?

Trumpublicans must be watching this while cackling, salivating, and a 666 glows on their forehead, delighted at the news.  They love hearing of mass death, carnage, and the suffering of non-whites
😭
shaky shaky shaky shaky
Noooo pls guys pls stop this nonsense pls 1 like 1 pray :(
Donald?! Why?
I'm ready for the next hurricane to hit the east coast and get rid of some racists scum!
I hope everyone's okay. Stay safe for all of the survivors in Mexico. We love you.
If Trump wants a wall, America needs seawalls. God be with Mexico.
My nieces etc live there. It was so sad to hear them crying on the phone.
So scary 😱 sending my prayers to all those affected by this 😔
This is happening in Mexico because God doesnt like people being nasty. Men and women wear seductive clothes. People make nasty music like the ecstasy and trumpet thing. This is their punishment. So sad.
I feel even worse for those poor children who perished. I wish I could be there to help those kids who survived.
God bless the world.
cuz the wall they dont want to pay
description of anticrist  is   he will be  blind in one  eyed   he will have  big  body  like  body builders  and  his  hair will be  curly   and  his  skin will be  white
lol spics deserved this. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
My dad lives there😣😣😭😭
I think it would be inhuman if donald trump would charge Mexico the wall
This is so sad😭😭😭😭 .....Prayers for mexico !!!!! Im so sorry for anybody that lost their loved ones in all this natural disasters !!!! Miles de bendiciones para mexico lindo, Dios los llene de fuerza y bendiciones!!!!
Looks like we don't need the wall
They're still paying for the wall though......RIP the non criminal Mexicans.
Wow... Looks like Syria..
The views are 666 😯
#MAGA
I hope lots of Mexican die I call that race reduction ...nature have way of reducing race......................
God is Punishing Mexico for saying slanderous things about America and Trump.  Just desserts!\nI'll be satisfied when the whole country falls into the Ocean.
LISTEN UP SJWS! WE NEED TO TAKE DOWN THAT RACIST EARTHQUAKE WITH OUR PROTESTING!
*we are living beings, please help mexico*
I love the part where he says people are running and screaming, things are falling off of shelves... and the video is of people just standing there. MSNBC is a clown show. 'Absolutely Horrific Images' of people standing around and a car with a broken window!!!! CLOWN SHOW, FAKE NEWS NETWORK
MSNBC jumping on the click bait train that is YouTube
I hope my Gardeners ok.
As the Almighty says, The allegory of those who take masters beside their Creator is like spider web and her house. that is why those houses are coming down. Now we have the Scientifically Proven Scripture based on Mathematics the Exact Science. It says if you DO NOT thank your Creator every day for the roof over your head, for your job in order to get His provisions, for your health and protections, and if you do not pay 10% of your earnings to the needy relatives, fatherless children, and homeless people, then DO NOT expect any protection from your Creator, although He has given us enough respites.
Click bait.  You said horrific images.  Didn't see anything horrific.
I'm a native Mexican, I was born in the great city of Chihuahua, Mexico. So I feel very sad that my people are going through 2 earthquakes in less than a 2-week time frame! I hope the international community steps up to help look for survivors, give relief to injured people, and help rebuild Mexico City(El DF).
Can people give me support? My home country is Mexico and recently there was a earthquake and destroyed my grandparents home😥. I really want to help them but my parents don't have enough money. So please give me any help. Anything will help❤️God help me and others with the same problem❤️😥
but why Mexico 😭😭😭
Jesus is coming
So let me get this straight, we see an eclipse, then some hurricanes and two earthquakes, all relatively within the same time frame and you still want to skip church this Sunday?
Turn to the One and Only God.Our Creator and the One who will give us death.\nTo Allah belongs All the Power and To Him we all shall return.\nRepent before its too late !

Happy happy birthday
I love you so much and im so glad youre so real and i have hyperhidrosis too and i just love that you get it.
I am a sweater too and it is annoying beyond annoying....
The yellow stains are the reaction of the sweat mixing with the aluminum in a lot of deodorant. Make sure your deodorant doesn't have aluminum and you won't get the yellow stains. If you do, soaking the shirt in vinegar and water, then scrub in tide with a toothbrush before washing and the stains should come out. I used to do this for my son
What lip product is on your lips? So pretty.
I am currently using Zero Sweat antiperspirant. You have to use it at night and it works while you sleep to close your pores or something. But you have to be careful and follow instructions and use a light amount. It is strong and will irritate your underarms if you use too much.
I'm a sweat girl. between the legs 😣and pits.
I think you are soo beautiful and you represent us dark skin women so well. I even turned my 59 year old mom to you. ❤❤😍
BUY CHLOROFRESH / whole organic Chlorophyll and you will never ever ever ever smell again.  You can exercise ALLLL day and sweat to your hearts content but you will not smell. That's 1/2 the battle. Trust me folks. The benefits is astronomical.
I think my son has this. Awww! Lol thank you for the tips baby!!! 😘
I suffer from under arm sweating as well. I receive my Botox injections every 3-4 months. FYI my health insurance covers my injection. Also Jackie research MiraDry it suppose to be  a permanent solution but very expensive in office procedure.
Triple dry deodorant (uk) is the only one that works for me, instantly but especially after 3 days use. It's changed my life. I was about to go get Botox but I don't know about the price.  I lost 40lbs and I still have this issue if I don't use it.  🙄🙄
I usually don't sweat in my face but somehow it happens a lot when I use foundation, so a tip a friend showed me was to use milk of magnesia in my T-Zone! It really works! And I've also discovered that my skin is a lot better(healthier) because I feel like the product doesn't sip into it.
Awwweee the memories 😣😣😣😣😣😆😆 I use to put tissue under my arms. Didn't help. At all 😐. The struggle was real. Now that I'm older, I notice shaving helps allot. I'm started to face sweat instead now. It went from my armpit to face. And I think that's worse. Honestly idk both are bad but manageable.
I have this :( but antiperspirant darkens my underarms. When I use natural deodorants (non-aluminum) I don't smell but the sweating doesn't stop. Any product suggestions? I don't live in the US but iHerb ships internationally so if there's anything I can get from there that works, pleeeeeease let me know. I heard botox helps but couldn't afford it.
There's growing awareness on hyperhydrosis and thank God. I only found out it had a name this year after sweating buckets for as long as I can remember. The American Hyperhydrosis Society is fantastic and is lobbying to fund more research into this painless but excrutiatingly embarrassing condition. I have it on my face...yeah. So I have good skin because I'm always sweating but the upshot is that I've spent most of my life either saying Nooooo, it's not raining. I'm just...warm or feeling acute shame. And there ought not to be any shame in perspiration but for some reason (especially when it comes to a woman) the social stigma can be very real. Thanks Jackie for highlighting this because it's not widely known.
Of course I can't self-diagnose accurately but I relate to this video so much. My sweat started smelling at the age between 4 and 5 and I've worn deodorant ever since. I didn't know that sweat didn't smell when you were younger until we learnt about puberty. I sweat a lot in general but I am mainly sweaty on my hands and feet and I HATE it. When I was younger I never wanted to play those games where you held hands or something with other kids because I was already sweating and then another person's body heat? Hell no. I always have serious anxiety from this. It was really bad in grade 5 and 6 because in class I would have to get up, grab a tissue, pretend to blow my nose but instead wipe my hands because my books would be drenched and I was so embarrassed. I now don't give high fives and everyone thinks I don't like hands because that's easier to say than sorry, my hands are dripping right now. I'm so nervous to have a partner in the future because I can't do hand holding or anything to do with touching. I hope that it gets better as you say it does and thank you so much for talking about this x
Everything you spoke about I checked them off my list... Thanks for this vid dove is the only thing that's been working for me....
OMG!!!! IDK THERE WAS A NAME FOR IT!!!! OMG!!!!
Thank you Jackie for educating me on this! I know a friend who sometimes smells and my friends say that she sweats a lot even in winter and Now I understand why and I shouldn't be judging her!
I have hyperhidrosis in my hands and feet and I hate it so much! So glad i'm not the only one
Omg Jackie!! So that's my problem??? I have had this every since I can remember, and now as an adult, you finally gave me answers and HELP!!!' 😘😘😘😘Thanks
I have it, triggered by anxiety 😣
Ughh I feel so self conscious when I need to shake hands with someone and I can't bring myself to hold hands with anyone😭 I sweat a lot on my arm pits but I shower regularly and wear deodorant. I feel like I get more sweatier than people when I walk and idfk...does that mean I have hyperhydrosis? Or am I wearing the wrong clothes?
Oh my goodness!!! I never thought to research or figure out if my sweat condition had a name. I could relate to you so much, and I suffer from sweating hands. Embarrassing!! I also love some polyester clothing. I found out wearing a cute jacket over top, keeps from showing that I'm sweating. Some tips of yours I've used in the past. But I'll be definitely trying some new ones I learned from you.
I swear from my face, armpit, scalp massively!!😒😫😫😫. After straightening my fro, it literally reverts after 1hr in the club 😂😂, walking around with half fro, half straight hair
Ugh! I suffer from this! Had it since I was 13! I sweat more when I am nervous, uncomfortable, or my body is straight up overheating! 😩 There is an Antiperspirant that has helped tremendously called Certain Dri If you're in the states, you can purchase it at Target/Wal-Mart. But if you're overseas, you can purchase it through Amazon or Buy Now. This has really helped me. I know longer have to wear BLACK to every occasion! Lol
The one deodorant I didn't understand was teen spirit. Ew. Never smelled good NEVER liked it. I've been using mens deodorant since I was a kid. My sister has to use it too because her one pit always smells so bad lol
*ya being a girl & having huge sweat stains in the armpit area is not cute!! Esp in public!! These r good tips... cuz i hate sweat!! Luckily antiperspirant deoderant is good for me...*
Suddenly I don't feel so alone.. I have it on my hands, underboobs, and my nose and right above my top lip. No where else on my face. It sucks. I love wearing makeup but I hate sweating it off of my nose. I'll get the highlight on my nose perfect and an hour later it looks like shit.
Musty Matilda 😂 Why you gotta go and make everything so funny!
Does anyone else sweat behind their knees?? And let's not talk about sweaty feet 😔😔
I also suffer from hyperhidrosis, but mainly on my face, so it's SUPER embarrassing. I tried Sweat Block! (wipes that you can use), but they stung my face lol so maybe only use them on your body. I now use a prescription called Oxybutynin. It's mean for your bladder, but the side effects are to decrease sweating and it works! I pay like $3 with my insurance lol
This is so helpful! I think I also have this condition and didn't even know it had a name. \n\nThanks for the tips!
I'm sweaty too and ppl always want to HUG me AHHH! My Lieutenant wanted to hug me last week and I damn near passed out. I hate it sometimes I back away and I can tell ppl think I'm being rude, but in reality it's not that I don't want to hug them I'm just embarrassed because I sweat so much and I don't want anyone feeling my sweat or smelling it. The struggles is real
Likes wow this was me as a preteen. I wish I knew about this back then. I'm luckily no longer like this but dang it was rough.
I have the feet ugh
yes girl thanks someone that relates to me and im not insecure about it as much. i get it from my my dadd and in middle school my friends would pick on me that i sweated alot and it was gross.  thanks for this video girl help alot im getting some cloths from your collection to!!
Thank you for this Jackie!
I love this video. I sweat everywhere...my favorite deodorant is over the counter prescription strength antiperspirant. Its a little more expensive but worth it. I love all of your tips and agree. Thank you for bringing up this subject. My favorite sweat proof eyeliner is marc jacobs.
Thanks for taking the time to share this! My underarms, hairline, and most especially the back of my head from the base of my skull to my nape are my worst areas. I've actually considered botox, I just haven't done it. Two things that help me are to keep my armpits shaved (the hair just encourages dripping) and keep my hair off my neck. The biggest thing that has helped me has been seeing a chiropractor who specializes in nutrition response testing. She helped me to better balance my hormones, which caused the sweating to chill. I still get very sweaty if I'm at all overheated  (I live in CO at 7k altitude and STILL get overheated in weather above 60 degrees!) and my long sleeved shirts stay pushed up my forearms  (SOOOO glad I don't have uniform regs forbidding it now!!). But it's a lot better than it was a few months ago!
i love this video sm! i hope jackie does an updated lazer hair removal video bc i've been waiting on that forever
did you say La Puente?!?!?! if u did, thats my hood!!!
I love you Jackie!
I'm trying the panty liner thing! Thank you
You're almost at two million!!
I have this as well, BUT I use medication for it! Drysol has SAVED MY LIFE! I apply it on my armpits overnight and wash it off in the morning - I will not sweat all day! I think it’s like $12 online
Recommendation for face sweat! Try a silicone based oil controlling primer, it has made a LOAD of difference for me! Drug store brand I use is the Milani primer in a black tube... hope this helps someone!
I am so use to this that sweating a lot  is normal for me but in reality lol I sweat more then the average person mine is triggered by nerves.
I have this problem but with my face and one of the things that annoys me about it are  the people who are like omg you're sweating or why are you sweating it's not hot  like girl don't you think I know that. Yes I sweat a lot , get over it 😒 it just makes me feel even more embarrassed
OMG this video is so relatable!!!! I never knew there was a name for this issue...... I thought I just had oily skin its so annoying. I also sweat on my underarms and I have triggers too. I would think my body is freaking​ weird! Thanks for the tips😊
I'm a heavy face sweater and it makes makeup DIFFICULT.
The cotton part of the presentation may have less to do with sweat and more to do with the political climate!  So, tell American Cotton to KMA!
I have the same issue and I use a roll on and then a spray straight after it really works
Wow, I think I've finally found the reason why I sweat a lot.
I use cornstarch with an essential oil like peppermint under my arms, but I sweat from my face most, hate it cause before I learned about good makeup my face would melt off haha, but I've learned how to control it better by slowing my breathing and it helps to slow/stop sweating because it's related to anxiety. \nI'm a new subscriber, I didn't know your were from La Puente :), I'm from the south bay/harbor area San Pedro. :)
For the longest time I thought there wasn't a name for it either. I just called it stress sweat. Worse part is I can take a shower. Put on men's antiperspirant and then all it takes is me being stressed or nervous and it's almost like it washes off. So many clothes have either a permanent stain or smell weird in the armpit area :/
Jackieee omg I've never been so relieved in my life!! I sweat so much under my arms and my hands from anxiety and california heat but I also thought that was just me.. I'll definitely start trying the antiperspirant instead and talk to my doctor. Thank you so much, you're a lifesaver!! xx
Take COLD showers for 30 days. It will change your immune system and make you sweat less
Also I have tried Drysol. It WORKS but I got an allergic reaction to it. Clean dri is a deodorant version of it and SUPER easy to use and well! Dont even need insurance in the deodorant section.
I have had excessive sweating since having my baby , before I would hardly sweat,  I need to go get this checked out.
I have the  exact same problem. The only thing that really helps unfailingly is botox injections. I do 100pp and it last for 6-8 months and i dont sweat out of nowhere. After thst ill maybe sweat in situation like is a bit hot or im wearinfmg layers whereas others wouldnt get a bit round spot. I remember having to go to toilet to dry my underarm of my shirt. Before using  botox, i would work at the office and always have wet spot for no reasons (heat, running etc).  I tried everything and this is the most effective. The doctor who came with that hes in Canada but many other clinic have the procedure. Also in between you can use driclor at night. Ok im posting rhis before watching the vid ill watch now lol
TALK ABOUT SOMEONE WHO LITERALLY GETS BEADS OF SWEAT AS SOON AS THEY PT ON FOUNDATION most annoying shit on earth 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
We need an updated foundation routine, full glam, everyday and etc.
I have whats called Cranial Hyperhydrosis, I sweat like a MoFo from my head it looks like I just stepped out of the shower or a rain storm like 24/7 I've gone whole months never one having dry hair even blow drying wouldn't work I wouldn't even get half way done and my hair scalp would be dripping. This form of the condition is impossible to hide you would think a hat or wool cap would work but all you get is a wet soggy cap sliding down your head. Sadly Botox is the only thing that can hep with this problem and it costs about $1000 per treatment because you need like 2 full vials of Botox but it lasts like 9 months and I think it's worth every penny. Yet I don't sweat from my armpits at all but under the boobs total different story.
You're speaking my childhood!!!!!!
Thanks for this video!  I actually use Certain Dri which minimizes the pores under your arms over night & you wash off the access in the morning. It works better & better as you use it every night.
Certain-Dri has saved me from sweaty armpits. I used to never be able to wear tight fitting shirts because they would always get sweat rings. Now I can wear whatever I want and feel confident about it.
i live in southern Az and im a dog groomer, i thought i was supposed to be this sweaty? maybe im not? but for your sweat proof makeup video, try maybelline's lash sensational waterproof mascara! that stuff survives the shower that comes from a shaking golden retriever!
I' would love a face tutorial for face sweater like me!!
I am beyond thankful this is the struggle of my life
So I sweat A lot I do suffer Hyperhidrosis in my face and I want to help because like a year ago I found something on the internet and I can't imagine myself without it it's call ODABAN and trust me you need it
Wow this is the story of my life
Still bomb af in my eyes😍
I have recently discovered a sweatproof t - shirt from a company called Thompson tee...  wish i had these in high school, the small bamboo knit with v neck works best for me since it can be worn under any shirt even T shirts without noticing.. makes it through  a whole day witout any sweat getting through but i still have a few for rotation through the week for washing when they smell.. they have them for both men and women so if anyone really needs to not worry about the visual appearance of sweat on clothes look into Thompson tees. They work.
You look like a nigga I used to run track with
I have hyperhydrosis too! Hands and feet 😩😩 ugh!!!!!! I have to use that damn lotion ahhhh kill me
Can I get a whiff
my niece and a friend suffer from this, it really effects their lives. I would see a specialist about it.
WOW JACKIE, I'M LOVING THIS
Spot on! Anxiety makes you sweaty because your body releases antihistamines to make you sweat and thus cool down your trunk/core where all your essential organs are! Yay fight or flight chemical responses! Sadly, it's usually pulling the water from your intestines, so hyperhidrosis can go hand in hand with constipation. FUN TIMES x.x
Thank you for being so real with us. I never knew this had a name and these tips are going to save my white t shirts 😂
Any recommendations on a good antiperspirant? I can’t find anything that works
OKAY LITERALLY THE MOST HELPFUL VIDEO EVER
Can we just talk about how gorgeous Jackie is... can we just... ahhhhhhh she's literal walking art
I genuinely really appreciate this video because I've dealt with hyperhydrosis for so long and theres only so much that google searches can tell you! Thank you!
I sweat a lot under my arms and I hate how people point it out or when kids make fun of it. They're like hey, your armpits are sweaty like, WELL NO SHIT! I'M SORRY MY BODY IS DOING IT'S NATURAL BODILY FUNCTION! it's not hurting you so MIND YOUR OWN FUCKING BUSINESS!!!
I'm one of those natural deodorant Crystal users and it works if you're sedentary, but I'm not, so I add tea tree oil to my underarms.  It's a natural anti-bacterial so no scent forms (bacteria is what causes funk) and it's awesome.  Cornstarch messes with my pH, and I get red rashes under my arms.
EVERYTHING SHE SAID IN THIS VIDEO IS SO TRUE LIKE I DEAL WITH THIS EVERY DAY AND IM SO HAPPY TO SEE THIS VIDEO
Botox shot works for months.  My daughter gets it
I don't have an issue with body sweat, but my face sweats so easily. It's so embarrassing. I feel like I can't wear makeup during the summer because of it.
Smelling like activity 😂😂😂😂
Smelling like activity..lol
I have hyperhydrosis!
Favorite beauty guru😍💕
Me too Jackie, me too.
Anybody ever tried this,rybbing lime under ur arm and wait for abt 15 mins before shower.It rly wrks.

These Idiots\n*watching Grace and Mamrie*\nFUCK IM CRYING
Congrats Tyler!
congratulations Tyler 😭😭😭😭
Where was shane dawson😟😐
ITS CASPAR NOT CASPER HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
the first video I ever say of Tylers was him reacting to Darren criss photoshoot by the end I was in fits of laughter just because his personality and laughter is just so contagious. I love you Tyler
i've been watching you for like 4 years now and, boy oh boy, you're a gem. that proud feeling never fades away. i want to meet you so bad. love from india.
WHY DID I CRY SO MUCH?????
Congratulations Tyler my favourite memory was the helium singing challenge you did and I remember sat on my couch in my living room laughing my head off with my headphones on watching it and my mom thinking there was something wrong with me cause I was crying with laughter 😂😂😂 I love you Tyler keep it up and congratulations xxx ❤️❤️❤️
AMAZING VIDEO!!! LOVE U TYLER 😚😚😚😚😚
My favorite memory are all the drunk collabs you've done. Dying laughing EVERYTIME.
Thanks for teaching me so many valuable lessons like not accepting pickle juice in my life. I haven't been here for 10 years I've been here for 4 but I'm still so so so proud of you. Congrats on 10 years and I can't wait to see what's next for you/us.
My favorite memories are binge watching all your drunk videos(mostly with sawyer, and I miss them!) my freshman year of college and even when I was extremely stressed or depressed your content made me laugh so much. And your book touched my heart, so thank you
Trying to hold it together during this until Hannah Hart made me cry, oh and Tyler remember that time you shat yourself haha congrats on a full DECADE on YouTube!!
Tyler when Joe came up: me
Congrats Tyler!!! So happy for you ❤️❤️❤️❤️
i watch you be so unapologetic of who you are and you are such a big part of my coming to terms with who i am, my sexuality, and being completely comfortable with myself, it's been hard, but every time somebody in the lgbtq+ community has spoken up and shared such big parts of their lives and being so brave like you have, more parts of me realise that i shouldn't be sorry about who i am and my sexuality. you've helped me so much, especially being young and in a country like indonesia where this topic is still such a taboo. i love you so much, thank you for all you've given me.
I don't always love your content but congrats on 10 years!! Keep doing you!!
okay i cried and ive not been here from your first video i joined your journey somewhere in the middle and its made my journey beautiful im gonna stick around till the end cause i love you
Lol he spelt Caspar Lee with an e🤣🤣😂😂😂😂btw Caspar hates it when people do that
You have inspired me so much and I'm so happy that you are you and you share your life with us. Love ya Tyler!
Colleen wasn't informed of this?? 😢 She belongs in this vid
Old youtuber is the best
Hey Tyler, I have never commented on a video before but I have been watching you for probably 6 of the 10 years you have been on Youtube, I remember being a lonely middle school student and seeing one of your videos and just laughing so hard because you were such a funny and upbeat person. Every time one of your videos goes up I usually see it within a day, but this one slipped into my watch later list and was not seen until today. It makes me so happy to see all your friends talking about how you inspired them, you inspire your fans too (obviously)! Keep on doing what you are doing! I also love your book Binge <3
I loved meeting you on your first book tour. you were soooo nice and really tried to take your time with every person even though they were rushing you. congrats!!
Wait do all the memories count because I've been on here for three or four years and just wow you are so amazing you make me smile when no one else can and I know your like omg not another 10 more years but for however long u continue I will support you everyone will thank you for everything ❤️❤️❤️❤️🌷👻
You're such a natural youtuber...hilarious, so likeable, and you have a powerful message. Thank you for opening hearts and minds and making us all better! I love watching you Tyler!
I had a big compleate comment all ready to post a little bit ago but my phone froze and I had to restart . instead of going as deep as before I'll simply say that I love you and your videos for the past 10 years and hope you continue making videos that make an impact for a long time. As for my favorite video I don't think I could choose just one but definitely the one that had the most impact on me before your chosen family series would be your coming out video. It made me feel less alone. We had a talk about it a few months back on Twitter. What I said then still stands. You helped save a life with your videos and continue to inspire me every time you upload. \nMuch love, \nStephanie \nMy Twitter handle : @WinterRavenRz
THIS MADE ME SO EMOTIONAL 😭😭😭 so so so happy for you Tyler and everything you’ve accomplished. I’ve been a viewer for many years now and you were one of the first YouTubers that inspired me, and continues to inspire me. Without people like you I never would’ve had the confidence to start my own channel and follow my dreams. You’re amazing and deserve all of the love in the world 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼❤️❤️❤️❤️
Aaannddd now I'm crying💙💙💙💙 Love you Tyler
happy (late) 10 years ❤️💛💚💙💜🖤 TYLERRE i defiantly havent been here for ten years but i can promise that ill be her till theeee enddd thank you for ten years and heres to 10 more years thank you
Was kinda hoping Superfruit would be in the video damnit
You inspired me to love and embrace myself more than anything else. I've been watching since 2009. I came out to my family last year. Thank you, Tyler.
Congratulations on 10 years, Tyler! I've been here since 2013, and it's been the best 4 years of my life. You've inspired, and helped me through so much. Thank you for everything, and I can't wait to see what comes in the coming years. Maybe I'll be lucky enough to meet you at VidCon next year, who knows! Love you!
he has so many friends!
I had tears in my eyes watching that. Aww
we love you tyler ❤💙💚💛💜
Your rant about bacon in the cafeteria... will always be my favourite 👌
congrats tyler ! actually when the first time i saw your vid its the first time that i known a lot of youtubers like connor franta , zoella , alfie , joe , joey , hannah , and others , you've change my life , your an inspiration , keep it up
Awe this is cute, happy 10 years
imagine if darren criss would have been in this
Its funny he started this when i was six and now im sixteen and have watched his videos since i was 10 so yeah and Tyler also made me beleive in myself and even though he doesnt know me he actually helped me come out as bisexual to my parents so Tyler if you magically reading this just letting you know thank you for always being part of my life.
Damn his views are tragic he really DIED out
I love you Tyler. Congratulations on 10 years babe. Keep up the good work. ❤😍
I love you Tyler!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💛💛💛💛💛💛💚💚💚💚💚💚💙💙💙💙💙💜💜💜💜💜💓💓💗💗💗💖💘💘💘💕💞💝💗

You were one of if not THE first YouTuber I subscribed to that made original content (not reuploading videos from 10 years ago for people to rewatch). From there my love for you and my love for so many YouTubers has blossomed. \nCongratulations on 10 year and I love you. Thanks for being you <3 <3 <3
You helped me come out. You were always so fun and outgoing even online. Youre not afraid to show who you are. Happy 10 years 😁 thank you for being an inspiration.
I started crying when Jackie came on and cried through out the rest of the video. I'm actually crying. Love you Tyler.
these idiots and this, people, is bEST FRIENDS GOALZ
Happy 10 years boo ♥️ we all love you Tyler Oakley & you inspire us every day (:
Thank you for including us. You are my role model for being true to yourself.
I first watched you on 5awesomegays. It was inspiring to see you be open and authentic. It helped me be more open myself
I loved this,  I really wished they put Troy in it
Tyler in seventh grade you truly helped me accept myself for who I am. I'm a freshman now as happy as ever with a bright future ahead, but without you I would still be in a hole of self doubt and not accepting myself. So thank you so much!
His reaction to Joe is all of us
Wtf is CASPAR🙄 \nHope you did the Casper thing as a joke or something 😪
I love your laugh and your sense of humor. I saw you first on one of Zoe's vlogs and I loved you since then. 10 more years to come :)
His dad is HOT
Love this, congrats Tyler 💜 but I’m just going to say CASPAR**
What happened to Shane's video or Marcus butler video 📹
wow, i miss the old youtube im crying i cant breathe i miss it more than anything😭😭 this is the first video of tylers ive watched in years FUCK IT HIT ME HARD
You've given this small town Canadian trans gay boy hope and love, you inspire me each and every day. You are my hero ❤️ Congrats on 10 years. Here's to many more
I've been here since 2010 and this brought me to tears. I feel like you've matured so much and grown into this more beautiful, more confident, more positive version of who you were ten years ago. AND HERE'S TO TEN MORE!
The greatest is when you fangirling over darren criss photoshoot, the one that he's topless. That was fun and the on when you finally get to made a video with him👏💛💛 lots of love from Indonesia tyler💛💛\n\nHAPPY 10 YEARS TYLERR
#whereistroye
Where is colleen/Miranda

It's so crazy I was a closeted little boy having a hard time comeing out as ftm and watching him since 6 th grade really hellped me ily
Congrats my love, I remember when I first started watching you and wow how you’ve grown. Can’t wait to see how long you do this !!💛
Congrats Tyler. My favorite memories are you drunk with Mamrie. I wish you the best always. No matter what the future brings, you are made to shine. x
“Connieeee” my heart broke into a million pieces
This was so special ❤️
LeBron and the Cavs or Kyrie and the Celtics: Who ya got?
Fuck all those people who talk about DRose like he's a shitty player. He just averaged 18pts per game last season with two bad knees. That's 18pts a game in the NBA. Not a lotta guys who underwent multiple surgeries can do that. He's an MVP and he's still a star in this league. And obviously, Bron knows that.
D Rose> Irving. Yeah i said it.
Why these idiots talking about rose like he sucks, we all know he is very injury prone but when hes healthy he balls out.
*Not talking to teammates? Wow he really wants to be Kobe.*
you got IT who was traded after leading Boston JAe who always want to him. Drose who trying to proof himself in the league. LEbron in his 15th year proving hes still the BEST. This whole squad is Ready
I just wanna say i dont watch espn any more because it doesnt matter. Its either Kryie Lebron or the Warriors that get talked about every day ALL day on every show !! Boring! i just come on here to comment.
Derrick rose gonna blow by kyrie many many many times\nKyrie's defence is ass
Shouldn't  they  be  more motivated  to  beat the defending  champions??
I don't get it. The Cavs got better. When ever you get a player like IT it cancels out Kyrie. Plus Crowder adds defense. Lord knows Cavs needed defense. They did get better. It's up to the coach to utilize those pieces. If this was popavich running this Cavs team. We would be talking about a title.
Then gets punished by the warriors🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Calling it: Kyrie's gonna score 48 on 37 shots and Lebrons gonna drop a 23 point triple double and win. K love will drop 32
well, that WOULD be more realistic than thinking they could beat Golden State...
All these casuals who think the Cavs got better.......LMAO
They are not beating the warriors.
I don't think people realize that Kyrie had sketchy knee issues last playoffs, he was basically a no show in the finals. He did go off in like 2 games but he definitely wasnt his usual self.
Yeah, the Cavs could be motivated and determined to beat Kyrie and the Celtics but.....\n\n\n\n\n\nCould they still beat the re-vamped warriors😈😂
still lavs will end up destroyed by warriors and lequeen will join his daddy lonzo in lakers
Rose is going to get injured
Why are people saying...THE CAVS GOT BETTER when they haven't even played a game yet ???  Better would mean they improved on DEFENSE.  NOBODY seems  to wanna talk about the Cavs terrible defense.  That's the main reason they lost the finals...they didn't have a defense.  Here is the reality :  It doesn't matter how much offense the Cavs have...if they can't defend...GSW - WILL - REPEAT.   Understand ??
Derrick Rose about to snap this year 21ppg watch
Kinda glad the happened for LeBron extra motivation even if not needed.
They should be worried about the gsw
Lol at those casual haters. 81 Down voted to 1k up. Lebron is the best right now, and the third best ever of all time. Now just grow up and accept those terms.
Remember when Kyrie got sat all of fourth quarter during the PLAYOFFS cause Lebron didn't need him lmao. The Lebron show!
Not until rose get injured or lebron get frustrated.
Hay ..... No one talk about Kyle Krover ..... He is a great arc shooter   and DRose still have it . I respect both the guys.
Jonah Hill sure knows a lot about basketball.
Lebron so great he worried about other peoples legacy.. GOAT
That's cool but on the real they going quit sleeping on HeatNation
They were gonna be em regardless and with kyrie on there Now. Its gonna be personal
they're about the same. and that's only said with Jae Crowder in mind, IT was the primary ball handler and scorer for the Celtics, the offense manifested around him mostly.\n\nin Cleveland that changes, LeBron will be the primary scorer and alot of the time LeBron will be handling the rock especially in the late third and fourth Quarter.\n\nlet's face it the cavaliers lost some guaranteed scoring and with ITs hip problem (if it's a problem) it'll probably be that much more of a deficit in the scoring colum from game to game. Isaiahs averages will go down especially with D rose  playing back up (maybe SG). they've gotten some solid depth but I don't think it's enough to beat that Celtics team in 7 games.
The Cavs are done. Kyrie sees that before everyone else has and yall call him crazy smh. Cavs won't make it back to the finals but IF they do, next season will be the last time..
o shit like clock  work they don't need kyri!
1:06 most awkward yeah of all time
Do you really need to get motivated to beat an eastern conference team when you are on a stacked team?
Celtics might not even make it to the Eastern conference finals, they lost all their defense and they can't guard John Wall or Brad Beal
Cavs ought to be motivated to compete with the GSW and the hell with Kyrie.  Kyrie is not the Black Momba nor Jordan esc. He will always be Robin.
Kyrie a dick, creating a negative energy during playoffs and finals
Cavs should try to get 3 rd seed in the east
Celtics are gonna suck on defense. Kyrie won't have Lebron covering for him. Hayward won't have Gobert covering for him. Morris can't play any D. Horford is old.
this cavs-celtics rivarly is still one sided...it will continue to be so until lebron goes somewhere else
They should be motivated to beat the warriors
Niggas forget Rose be locking niggas up with those knees too lmao just watch this season
D-ROSE Former MVP wins a championship. thats news.
The sound is always off on this show. Buy them a better mike or something
Can't wait for them to flatten the Celtics.
the only thing that Derek Rose is killing is his knees
this just created a great potential matchup of the celtics vs cavs followed by another great matchup of warriors vs cavs
they should be motivated to try win another title and take out anyone in their way regardless, singling out a weaker team is just lame as fuck haha pathetic cunts just sour they don't have a super team anymore hahaha
Chubby gum gum man doesn't know nuts about basketball, except its vague resemblance to a chocolate Lindor truffle
LeBron gonna drop a triple double with a win, Irving gonna drop 40 with 2 assists and a L
Easy question derrick rose and Isaiah Thomas  and lebron James
Maybe I'm dumb, but shouldn't everyone be motivated to beat everyone? I mean, it's kind of like their JOB or something.
Bruh the sound is wack on this show. Sounds like Darth Vader 😑
Celtics only returning key players are smart and Horford , have 2 key 20yr olds brown and Tatum that they'll need to rely on, plus they are really small and have almost no rim protection, and will be outrebounded by everyone. I think Milwaukee is biggest theat to Cleveland this year. Boston needs an Anthony Davis trade or something like that to take over the post LeBron East. In 2 years 76ers will be better than Boston.
Lebron won't win any more ring, consecutive runner up finish to the warriors til he retires lol
What's up with the shitty audio though??
Last season, we are waiting for GSW vs OKC. And got disappointed because they're no match to GSW. \n\nNow, we are waiting for Cavs vs Boston. Kyrie will smash Lebron's ankles.
This is the start of a new fairy tale. For the reasons being, DRose will start as a guard for the Cavs. And if he does show up, whew... classic comeback story
Theres no talking UP D ROSE!!!! IT SEEMS YALL FORGET!!! SOOOOO QUICKLY!!!!!
well drose has been killing it last season averaging 18ppg while sharing the ball with melo and porzingis
This is not a fluke. Derrick Rose has been unfairly slandered for the past two seasons. He played well for the Knicks and will be better for the Cavs. Get used to these what a surprise segments.
Derrick Rose gonna surprise a lot of people.
single-handedly won a game against the Warriors? How does one single-handedly win a game in a team sport?
Cavs gon smoke niggas next season lol GS included keep doubting them , finally getting a motivated cavs team since 2015 , the same team that nearly beat GS without Klove and  that egomaniac i wish it was all about me guy on the team .. I knew my eyes weren't deceiving me when i used to see kyrie literally put no effort in on multiple defensive possessions routinely .The cavs playing up and down lack luster effort every other night last season .. I knew something was up with the team morale .. Fact of the matter is with the exception of game 4 in the ECF vs boston , Lebron was the only player that really flipped the switch come playoff time , he was other worldly and carried the cavs through i will admit a weakened eastern conference and vs  GS except when he took a lil breather  and we saw how the cavs performed ..
fuck them having animosity towards Boston, I wanna see a healthy Cleveland take it to GS
I didn’t know that Matthew delly was on this show lol
Celtics because that's my home team and LeBron is gonna go to LA after this season.
People screaming that kyrie saved Lebron. By may, I will be saying too bad kyrie can't save himself lol
Lebron and his gang gonna pull Kyrie and Horfords pants down and give  them the lebron special, fym
She said Kay felder like he's not that stick , bitch Kay felder raw as fuck stupid ass
Kyrie about to go stupid. He never single handily beaten GSw. Still gone lose in the playoffs to Washington or Lebron.
as much i hate lebron. him and it are going to embarass kyrie on opening night.
This might be the first time I've ever had to root for LeBron. Kyrie Irving has made kind of an ass of himself during this whole trade debacle.
I don't think anybody cares about Cleveland anymore... I think Kyrie pulled the rug out from under them. There is no up side to Kyrie leaving, who else is scoring?.. the Cavs themselves showed everyone what to do to make IT a nonfactor, Iman Shumpter is useless in most circumstances, Tristan Thompson's 12pts ain't enought, JR Smith isn't reliable, and K Loves heart falls out when it matters most... forget GS, they're barely eye to eye with Boston or Washington right now.
Rose should be starting because he's a all around guard and can't be stopped in the open floor.
yo like seriously, can we take a moment to say how amazing d.rose is on the court?! talking about kyrie... smfh
I can't wait to watch LeBron run Kyrie down and splatter his shit with a nasty chase down block!
They Need to be worried about the warriors
Kyrie will get stronger
cavs tilted, why not beat gsw?
the Jump is cringeworthy
I’m gonna beat kyrie butt
lol what about GS?
wow jonah hill got fat again.
Thomas = Kyrie\nJr = Brown\nLebron >> Hayward\nLove > Morris\nThompson = horford\nCLE Depth >>> Celtics depth
Bronsexuals mad coz no one's gonna bail out LeBum now. LMAO!
Cavaliers are trash😂Lmao
LeBron James 4-5 or 3-6
Irving gonna cook Rose watch
Yip the cavs gonna wip the Celtics ass
Crazy how people are tripping because Kyrie basically said fuck Lebron. LMAO Just respect dude who kisses no ones ass like many seem to kiss Lebrons.
CAS WAY BETTER!
Derrick Rose only kills himself.
Let's go cavs 😤
Celtics cant even beat my Wizards fuck outta HERE.
D.rose the truth
only problem for cavs is GS, Boston aint doin shit
Celtics gonna win
Liza is cuter than Joey

На учениях «Запад-2017» на полигоне в Ленобласти боевой вертолет попал ракетами по зрителям  The K52 helicopter shoots on the civilians during the military exercise because of the malfunction
You know the video is about to be raw when the title is in a foreign language
A Russian military helicopter accidentally fires on parked cars and journalists during a military exercise.
Go watch some helicopters they said\nIt will be fun they said
in mother russia, missile shoot itself!
“Mission failed, we’ll get em’ next time”
Only in Russia
Description has English translation.
Did I see someone die?? I need a translation!!
When mom tells you to wait in the car
Did dat guy survive?? It was brutal
How it feels to chew 5gum\n\n0:13\n\n5gum, stimulate your senses
They probably thought he was gay
was the pilot aiming for Poutine?
За пять дней учений Запад-2017 доблестная и славная военщина Хуйлостана(бывшая Россия) потеряла:\n\n— Командующего Воздушно-десантными войсками (ВДВ) России генерала-полковника Андрея Сердюкова\n\n— заместителя Главкома по воздушно-десантной подготовке генерала-майора Владимира Кочеткова\n\n— помощника главкома ВДВ\n\n— адъютанта главкома ВДВ\n\n—  трех хуйлостанских журналистов-пропагандонов\n\n— отделение из 6 саперов\n\n— корвет класса «Неустрашимый»\n\n— стратегический бомбардировщик Ту-22М3\n\n— учебно-боевой самолёт ЯК-130\n\n— машину управления БЛА комплекса РБ-341В «Леер-3»\n\nЭто только список, который попал в СМИ и подтверждён фото-видео материалами. Сколько там сейчас всего небоевых потерь не знает никто.\n\nЧто сказать???\n\nУчения удались во всю славу величия хуйлостанского(бывшего российского) оружия.
YouTube doesn't trend videos that deserve to be trending but trends a video of someone being hurt or potentially killed. That's fucked up
*0:13* when you forget to tell your co pilot to hold your beer.
YouTube turns into Liveleak for one quick video
That car cut him off in traffic earlier in the day?
Tf is wrong with YouTube
First off HO-LY SHIT!!!! Secondly who's the badass who gives zero fucks at 0:22 whos not crawling for his life and taking a leisurely breeze walk?
Malfunction, you mean the Pilot was being a dick.
This happens bc somebody messed with Your Mom, apparently.
Pewdiepie can't say obama is a nigger, Hitler did nothing wrong, or Jews did 9/11 but google actively promotes some guy getting incinerated live on screen.
Not one person (that I saw on this post) asked if that poor bastard survived the missile blast?!?
But were the Trucks OK?????????
Just a heads up, don't load the guns if your just doing an air show....
So are we going to conclude that guy walking is dead ? Or
They’re doing a military exercise in a civilian area with live weapons? What the fuck is wrong with them? \n\nI’ll leave this here for people trying to explain it:(Obviously they’d need real weapons in a real scenario with civilians around, but come on)
wow, trying to kill their counterparts. Smh
When you don't have a buzzard
(((Homosexuality is an abomination before a Holy God. If they dont repent and stop doing this sinful act they will not inherit the kingdom of God. Are they going to be lovers of their flesh more then lovers of their God/Creator??? And here is the scriptural Proff in the scriptures)))...  \nThen the Lord said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sins so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me, if not, I will know. (Genesis 18:20-21). Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-Both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to lot, Where are the men, (Two Angels), who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. (Genesis 19:4-5). Get out of our way, They replied. And they said, This fellow, (Angels), came here as alien, and now they want to play the judge we'll treat you worse than them.  They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, Get your relatives out of here, Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. (Genesis 19:12-13).\n\nDo not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).\n\n Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).\n\nGod gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).\n\n Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).\n\nThe look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).\n\nJesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).\n\nThey will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).\n\nSee Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.\n\nJesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).\n\nAm I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).\n\nJesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).\nJesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).\n\nTopheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  \n\nJesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).\n\nThis is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me.
Ok I think I got the controls. Wait what does this button do?
I like how this gets on the trending page
So that nigga in front died...
Weak ass missile... Had it been American it would have melted the camera
That's just how you get a ticket in Russia.
Did the guy walking towards the car dead???
this is some Just Cause shit .
Well at least Russian CGI is getting better
Scared me to death
Now that shit is what I call a demostration.
Are you hurt? Try a little harder next time.
Dude in the hoodie was totally banging the pilots wife
American news agency's: Trump blows up Russia with one missile
the target was the big truck it hit. If you don't want to get hurt, stay away from the target Dumbasses
Never new what the buzz around Russia was seen so many stupid videos from them not being able to drive being pissed drunk embarrassing themselves starting and losing fights, nobody likes your corrupt dumb ass country
Scared the fuck out of me I expected a helicopter to land or something.
It is odd to see this video among other entertaining materials. Seems that people are really interested in that. And YouTube doesn’t even try to check the contents!!
And this is trending why? The guy didn't die in the video and they claim it malfunction during training  (though must say how does something like that malfunction)
In Russia, human is target practice
The russian pilot was looking for his vodka bottle, in the helicopter cockpit.
Я хочу, чтобы мировая война три

Russian to English translation: oops!
I feel so high
Let me first say that this has no words. The message that was delivered in the vision of the director is what we call woke.  It gave me a sense of calming and peace I cannot explain and I would've Never liked this type of music!
Either She's Talking About Her Cjild Or DMT Trip
Thanks for blessing us with your art
Am I the only reminded of Vespertine?
Bjork open the gates to the other dimensions of my soul.
So I've just discovered Bjork and she literally has like 10 life-times full of content that is impossible for me to go through :(  So I'm only left to assume that she's either a legend or a time-bending alien ;_;
Primitively Advanced\nI found no other words to explain it from my viewpoint
The first part of the video could be the opening scene of a really cool MMORPG    :)
God I love this song, it kind of reminds me of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring :3
Maybe if you watch this when you’re high the pieces of the universe might just fit together
simple songs in medulla or even the quiet song like Unravel still better than this, but the video really works, i love this video, good job, savage.
Good for Bjork to find love again in such short time. Mesmerizing, sublime sound and atmosphere. The visuals remind me some of the Child of Eden game.
So at the end after ANOTHER realignment of the space/time continuum she reinvents lovemaking too 🤔🤔🤔
God am I happy to be alive the same era as this creature.. her art is nothing I've ever seen or heard before ... bjork you better fuck it uppp❤️😭🌸
C A R E  F O R Y O U
This song and video have opened my heart.
This composition is one of those which gets better with the video. This is art in its highest form.
Omg, she has such cute shoes! Like a silver Dorothy shoe! :O
This is so beautiful. It's going to be such an epic era 💗
All Is Full of Love v. 2.0. I can't wait for more!
The way she said parts omg it's so soothing
noooooooooo. that outro destroyed my life. that was gorgeous. One of my favorite artists.
Amazing. This feels like old Homogenic Björk and I love it!
It is the most extraordinary vision, I am moved you tears
I will always be in deep humane love with you, dear Björk. You are the reason why I believe in humans.
A songstress , an artist..A league to no one but to the cosmos!
Orgasmed in the most spiritual way
Love you Björk 💘💘 Your so beautiful and yr dress is very stunning and different
GRAMMY NOMINATION FOR BEST MUSIC VIDEO TAYLOR IS QUIVERING
Hope she wears htat Gucci dress in live performances as its some couture shit right there.
I don't know why I'm crying in the club right now
Uscoot habibti, I don't like catch. ESPECIALLY with hearts and children.
*sniffs the air* Hm, is it just me or does it smell a little bit like ARCA UP IN HERE!!! AYYEEEE, you betta work, my love!!!\n(Seriously, just one kiss from him and my life would be almost entirely complete.)
her music makes me feel a way no other musician makes me feel
So this is the new, 'No Man Sky', update? Looks good.
I hear such a deep sadness in this track that carried over from Vulnicura... Bjork is like a Siren; and you can feel every little feeling she is expressing whether you want to or not!... This one fills me with such unbearable despair; Bjork continues to enter unexplored territory every album and this one so far sounds like its focused inward like an audiofiles dream, its mixed beautifully and the sounds are lush and so crystal clear; and entirely unique. She continues to travel further away from the music composition and enters into the world of sonic landscapes rather than score complexity. I'm curious to hear the rest of the Album, every album is a gateway and a new opportunity to hear a coming world into the future of music.
This song makes me want to make love to a wolf in the woods
Strange how music in this moment is a reflection of profound Awakening and eYe opening One has.We exist in the higher Realms and though We are here,We are there as well.The eBB  and fLoW of Love can be passed and felt from one Realm to the next and every where in be-twixt. To send Love through the Astral Ether to your One True Spiritual Lover . It is Divine!
It still feels new, the place of wondering if the things you thought in passing were real were digital and the other way around and realizing of course yes; but she's been doing it since Vespertine.
Is this how it feels to transcend?
the costume looks like it was inspired by thumbelina especially the headpiece.
This is the trippiest thing ever
Looks like she spent some time in the 9th world
The first part is directly taken from a old record Birds of Venezuela, with the sound of rainforest frogs and the whistle of the Common Potoo!
And just think ricardo lopez is thinking to himeself down in hell why did i tru to kill her
Man Björk is truly one of a kind, and one in a million. To me she is beyond a legend, and her vision for music is way beyond this time, like I love how she takes me to another dimension, and everytime I look at her videos its like I'm diving into all her emotions. If you are an empath then you'll understand, but what I'm trying to say is that Björk is a True Artist...and there's no other like her, because she's a rare breed.
i can't believe björk just invented art
even though she's witnessed MOSTLY ALL female pop/rock stars  BITE HER STYLE for the past 10 years ...she comes up with something NEW and alternative...this is now what i would consider a MTV #BUZZCLIP !!!
It's beyond words!!! Thanks  God we witness these miracles
It's GROUNDHOG'S DAY with a new twist. Hollywood has definitely run out of novel ideas.
People calling her a genius as if the music was not produced by Arca and the video directed by Andrew Thomas Huang lol\nBasically all she did is screaming three words. Miss the old Björk
So BJORK has the All Spark!?
Bjork is so amazing. Love the new work!
LYRICS: My healed chestwound\nTransformed into a gate\nWhere I receive love from\nWhere I give love from\nAnd I\n\nCare for you, care for you, I care for you, care for you\nCare for you, care for you, I care for you, care for you\n\nSplit into many parts\nSplattered light beams into prisms\nThat will reunite\nIf you\n\nCare for me, care for me, if you care for me, care for me, care for me, care for me\nAnd then I'll care for you, care for you, I'll care for you, care for you\nI'll care for you, care for you, care for you, care for you.\n\nDidn't used to be so needy\nJust more broken than normal\nProud self sufficiency\nMy silhouette is oval\nIt is a gate\nI can care for you, care for you from, I can care for you, care for you\nI care for you, care for you, I care for you, care for you, I care for you, \ncare for you, you care for me, care for me, care for you.
I feel like Bjork is going to be the first artist to have her conscious uploaded into an artificial being.
Always the same boring videos ... Björk don’t realise we are in 2017 and not in 1998 ! ... waiting for Hit songs only ( like Pagan poetry ) and Hit videos ( like All is full of Love ) ... i expect better from this great Artist ... her creativity out of order !!?
OK NOW I REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY QUEEN MITCH LOVES HER SO MUCH THIS SONG IS SO GOOD
I'm pretty sure we can now all agree that Björk is an alien
Very, very nice.\n\nI am certainly looking forward to the new album. In fact, after the mediocre disaster that was Everything Now from Arcade Fire, Bjork better disappoint.
Bjork really loves the pitch _mi._
That Intro! <3

Hey can u react to Look What You Made Me Do choreography by Jojo Gomez? Sofia vergarrrrrrrrrrrrrrra
The Stranger Things boys are precious chicken nuggets.....They make me want to be like, SEE preteen/teen boys! Take notes! 👏💞
IM REVIEWING AT THE SAME TIME AS GRACE AND I PAUSED TO REVIEW MILLIE AND SAID THE EXACT SAME THING IMSVDNFJ
what mascara are you wearing!?? your makeup looks so nice
I was gonna be mad that Gal Gadot wasnt in the video but she wasnt at the Emmys either so nvm
Did you know Heidi Klum has a clothing line in Lidl (sorta like Aldi for those who don't know) for a week I think. Saw the advert yesterday and immediately thought of every red carpet review hahahaha
Grace I would happily watch you review fashions until the end of time, that being said, this was a particularly good one and coaxed a few real life LOLs from my black heart. Cute!
I want that purple suit jacket
'You know what's about to happen' ...hot flashes!! 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Someone in Hollywood please start aging . Pretty much
Third time watching this video when I have a deadline on Thursday lol oops! Your videos never fail to make me laugh - fucking love it
You are a genius, girl. I never get tired of your humor. Keep it up grace🔥❤️
I met you at VIDCONAUS! did you enjoy the lollies i got you, the pack with the banana smoking a pipe 😂
I tried out for my school's comedy club and it was probably the best thing i've done...
That top is slaying! Love dirty thirty!!
i dont know who half these people are but I still laugh and choke on my drink
Grace. I need to know. \n\nWhat's your favourite chip flavour.
Heidi Klum 😂😂 it's to the point now where I'm disappointed if she DOESNT show up!  Also LOVE the Elle Woods flashback. Reese Witherspoon looked fantastic!
You had me scared there for a minute Grace, I thought Heidi might not be there!
Was Heidi klum there ?? God I hope so
Winter is not the one coming... I die
What lipstick are you wearing? I LOVE it :D
they look like they have PhD's and respect women! Cute! omfg Grace 100%
ice dancer from Russia YURIO IS THAT YOU
Use your cock on me.
nice color in this video grace. perfectly saturated
Why RuPaul hasn't employed you to do this for Drag Race runways is BEYOND ME.
The most elegant Stegasorous in town 😂🌹
I just came here to say Fuck Meghan Rienks and Grace Helbig. This is all. Oh yea--didn't watch the video;)
Looove the video! I've made a video like this as well so if you want to watch it i would really apreciate it :)\nThank you!
Grace went to my highschool. Her picture is in one of the halls.
Why will you not come to the Netherlands Rotterdam mom
Idk but your sense of humour reminds me so much of willam belli haha love it
Mrs. Kate seriously invested big in youtube her creations are a part almost every big YouTubers house/office.
These are my fave videos ❤️❤️❤️
I want your tshirt!!!
Reese Witherspoon's dress was sooooo pretty.
Is it normal to have a boner and throw up at the same time?
Never fail to have a laugh with Grace.
SAMANTHA BEE!! I love her and her show, so glad Grace included her in this!
The answer to how is money and plastic surgery. #truth #facts
I. LIVE. for these fashion reviews.
Elle woods flashbacks are real for reese witherspoon and I'm HERE for it!
I've been wanting to say this every time you make a fashion review and Thandie Newton is there. It's pronounced TAN-dee. The H is silent
You did not review the people I wanted you to. I take this as a personal attack!
I can't get over how Laura Dern's feet are flipped...she is either wearing her shoes on the wrong feet, or she has her legs crossed(I'm going with the latter).
That slit is getting close to the clit sounds like a rap lyric
I cannot say it enough: I LOVE these fashion review videos. And I've tried to make one myself and know how difficult it is.
I need this shirt 😂
Holy shit..... this has actually been the BEST review video you've EVER done!!!! I'm crying, it was that funny!
WHERE'S HEIDI\n*edit*\nTHERE SHE IS
Grace will you ever do a live stream version of this while the event is going on?
Seriously though, why don't grown men dress as well as the kids from Stranger Things? Their stylists need to help some other people out!
bUT WHAT ABOUT RUPAUL
I was waiting for Heidi klum lol
Her shirt!!!!! 😍🔥❤️
Susan Sarandon can eat a dick.
Girl you gotta watch Handmaid's Tale!

Debra is not messing around 😂💯

When are you coming back to the UK? 💃
One thing that's upset me the most about Chester's death has been the way the media has talked about nothing *but* his death - very few have bothered to remember the life that came before and everything this wonderful man contributed. Although it breaks my heart imagining how scared the guys must be to perform again, I'm so proud of them for making this about his LIFE. They've handled this with such dignity and grace, and not allowed Chester to become overshadowed by his passing. I love you, LP.
When he started talking about how great Chester was I couldn't handle it
It's gonna be a roller coaster of emotions...\nMan, that got me really teared up. Imagining mike holding back tears and desperate not to sob on stage, just like what chester did while singing one more light at jimmy kimmel live in memory of chris.
That line at the end by Mike is the best. Thanks to everybody listening too. I felt that. It truly is great to hear from them again despite everything.
In most of the interviews mike and chester were together, fucking sad now Mike is alone and he's in pain 😭
I can hear the pain in his voice, it's so clear... But that has only increased my love and respect for Mike. In spite of everything that has happened and how it affects him, he still talked to us. And not only through social media but now also on the radio. I can't even imagine how he - and the other guys&Chesters family of course - must feel. The fact that he reaches out to us is just... it's just downright special and emotional and ugh I don't even have the words. I'm really fucking proud of him, and I know that the LP family will always have not only his back, but also the other guys' and Chesters family their backs. One day at a time. We will remember Chester forever <3 Always in our hearts #MakeChesterProud #fuckdepression
Its Nice to Hear Mike Voice After 2 months.
I just can't believe that Chester is not here. We miss you man, you are not just one more light, you are a part of us, a part of our childhood. \nThanks for this interview, Mike. You all are the best!
4:52 I thought he was going to cry.. this is so fucking sad man\n\nBut life goes on :(
mike is such a nice guy... I love mike
I want to hug him so bad.
Finding out they're honoring his passing on my birthday just made my day.
Oh, Mike... I am and then I am not looking forward to October 27. This is going to be hard.
Been a fan of the band since the first album so i've certainly had a connection with the band. I love this interview though, it's nice to hear from the band and how they're doing and what's happening
Without Chester im sorry they cant continue being Linkin Park, what they should do is switch to Fort Minor permanently and start making music under that name.
Sometimes i feel a little bit angry with Chester... he was my idol since i was 10 years, in someway i feel disappointment by him. i think nobody can imagine the damage he made to all people closer to him... Talinda, his 6 childrens, Mike, Brad, Phoenix, Joe and rob, all of them remained psycologically destroyed. sometimes, again, i feel so sad, angry and disappointment about him. Is not fair for us... Now, all of us are suffering his big mistake. \n\nOn the other hand, i'am so  gratefull with him beacause his music made me so fucking happy by 17 year, his music, Linkin park, dbs, cameos, interviews... My school, my high school, my trips, my hobbies, my relationships, my friends, every one of them are connected with his music i really, really loved the band and chester as singer. \n\nit's very sad, i love chester as a friend even without i have meet him personally.. He always will be in my mind as a good thing that lifes gift me
Mike is such a great nice guy. This was a good interview and very touching.
I am glad to hear Mike's voice. I'll hope everyone is okay. Dave, Hahn, Rob and Brad too. It is very dark time losing someone we loved. \nThank you so much for making this interview. At least, I know any progress about them. \n\nPS: I don't have twitter, facebook and instagram. So, I am kinda outdated to get the news.
Damn it, I cannot help crying just looking at the comments.
If Mike ever sings that song himself there will be tears
I can't believe people have disliked this video smh
pain in his voice... But good to hear Mike's laugh.
idk why i find this hole chester thing suspect but who knoes
Please don't stop Linkin Park. \nPlease continue your fantastic Job. \nI love you guys.
There's a reason he's 'The Glue'
Glad to hear Mike Sounding so well!
earphones on and closed my eyes\n. i don't want to get distracted from hearing his voice, after a while. and to hear he sounded okay.. make me feel okay.\nthank you for this. :')
Wish I could be at the upcoming event. \nGreat to hear from Mike!
So who's excited for new Fort Minor tracks?
#RipChester 😢😢😌😌❤❤❤💔💕💕
It felt SO GOOD to hear his voice again
Is there any chance of that tribute concert being broadcast online for other fans throughout the U.S. and around the world who won't be able to attend?
I got my tickets to this show today. I hope this will be a good time for everyone, and a source of some closure.
I love u guys so much and I am very sad that I can't come to the show in honour of Chester just because I am living so far away😔
3:20 one more light - how this idea pop out - heart breaking story </3
I'm so happy to hear Mike's voice again. I can't even begin to imagine how tough it must be for him, the rest of the band and Talinda. You guys handle it with a lot of care and dignity, and I wish you all the best in the future. Won't be able to see you guys live unfortunately, but I will always be there, making tributes and doing my best to support you. Thank you for everything.
So good to finally hear Mike's voice... Thank you so so much for uploading this.
I am very grateful for this
Just started on youtube to capture all the shit me and my mates get up to so any views, likes, dislikes or subs would help but shit i wont loose sleep if im still on 0 in 3 years 😂😂
Mike is so strong, I am so proud of him and LP. Its a heavy time for them, for us, for all fans. Its good to hear him. Stay strong, guys <3
Much love and respect Mike and LP and all Chester's fans, and family!
Such a Great Person.. stay strong r.i.p chester bennington 😭 he's an Angel now
😢💔💔💔 so much love to the #LP and the family rest in peace chester bennington xxxxx
Hey I'm thinking about you. I care. And sometimes that's enough.    Well.. Freaking true. It's so relieving to hear his strong words too, though.
It’s so hard to see that things are moving on without Chester, those 2 month felt kind of empty for me, and for a lot of people here i guess...\nBut it really helps to hear mike’s voice...\n\nThank you LPA to share this with us !\nDoes anyone know if there will be a live stream of the show ?\n\nAnyway, i think it’s such a symbolic date to honor his memory, just a few days after hybrid theory’s birthday.
He definitely was choking up while talking about the making of One More Light. I feel horrible for him and the rest of the band plus Chester's family.
It´s like medicine to hear his voice again <3
Thank you Mike , is this show going to be recorded or live broadcast so fans like me from Europe can see it too?
Mike is really in pain.......rip chester
I like that they didn't ask him about Chester's death and just let him speak a little bit about it
thank you for posting this
Thank you so much LPA  for uploading this interview
I hope that there will be a live stream or something for the fans all over the world who can not be there
thank you for sharing this ❤💔
Thank you very much! Also thank you Mike; for doing this.
yes ty mike we love you as fans\nkeep us proud we all are here if you need us \nkeep up the good work & remember you have the wheel now ((big hugs)) xoxo
Nice to hear Mike's voice...!!!
Wish you all the best Mike, the hole band and Chesters family..❤❤
In the tribute concert I would like to see the band members together sing One More Light to end the show, makes me tear up just picturing that in my mind.
Thank You Mike for this from 🇩🇪
This broke my heart a little.  But I needed this. I really hope they come back to tampa fl and do something.  I need to see them and cry out . Not to sound like a little bitch,  but this band has been in my life sense the 9th grade and I'm 33 now
it's very comforting to hear mike's voice
Will it be streamed for those of us around the world. \nI would sell my kidneys and liver if it meant I could attend this event, but it's not possible for me. \n\nCome on, please there's got to be some way you could let all those who care to be part of it.
He really likes to say the meat and potatos XD
Its been 2 months...2 months of sadness.R.I.P Chester Bennington.
it's so good to hear his voice. the guys are so strong and i know that they're gonna get through this even though the hole in their hearts will never be filled by anyone else ever again. i miss Chester so much and i know that he'd be proud of everything the guys are doing. i love them so much and hearing Mike's voice and his laugh gives me comfort in this hard time ❤️
This is so hard to listen to but it was nice to hear Mike again. Thank you for uploading this.
I love Mike. He is such an inspiration as well
Linkin Park should not fade away... please it is a remedy , a medicine for the cure to all the fans who are depressed and are lost...
Mike, stay strong, we love you so much and thankful for the way you handling this extremely difficult time.
Thanks for this. Mike is one of my favorite artist. He is so smart and understands the real linkin park fans.
God I miss Chester and wish I could've got to see lp live they were the first group I got into listening to music as a kid R.I.P Chester lp forever!
It's so good to hear Mike laugh. I feel sad for the guys that are apprehensive about playing without Chester and I hope they know that we support them no matter what. I think it will be healing for everyone involved. The Vegas memorial and following Talinda on Twitter have really helped me start to move on.\nPeace and love to all my fellow soldiers, we are all in this together. ❤️You all 🤘
😭😭😭\nThis... I can't...
I'm crying so hard it's blurry but Mike and the rest of the band member, we are here for you. We care❤️ Any LP fans who think the world will be better without them, fck no. You are so worth it. Remember us fans are here for you too❤️
18th Sep is her birthday, well 17th September was my 18th birthday
Rest in paradise,  Chester! To say you'll be missed is the understatement of the decade.  Wherever you are, know that you are loved. ...And you always will be 💛\nSending strength to the incredible members of Linkin Park and to every fan who may need a little extra love today,  tomorrow and for always. \nHugs from Cape Breton<3
So nice to hear from you, Mike. Sending you much love and wishing to be there at Hollywood Bowl on October 27.
Thank you for uploading this :)
This just came up in my recommendations and the first thing i thought was 'how can Mike be so strong about this'. He is amazing and i love them so much 😊
The fact that he had the strength to talk like this , makes u hopeful and to be more positive. #staystronglp thank you for this
GTA 3
Tearing me apart💔

Jonathan Davis better be doing one step closer!
thankyou so much for this Mike , LP4LIFE!!!!
2 months? thats fucking crazy, yet people like already dont care. probably because we get new information so fucking quick n more new news over n over than people jus forget. we need to like get rid of this way of getting information, i dont think its good for us
His 1st interview since?
My grandma passed away from cancer in December
I was my whole life a big fan of this band and there is this last consert! as a normal guy from vienna i guess there is never been a way to get there and listen to them but i hope they stream the shit out of there so i can watch it at home <3\n\nThanks Mike for this great Interview!!!
I'm not even going to lie Carly B  part is alright but Kodak Black part straight up garbage 😞it sound like Kodak just went in the studio and did anything because the record Carly B record is number one \n \n 
Repent from sin, Jesus is Lord, crucified, buried, rose from the dead on day 3, He died for sinners, turn to Him, He wants to know you
I don't like Kodak Black and why Cardi B didn't rap on this temix.?
Kodak ain't fucking with Youngboy like this if you agree
Kodak Black said at 1:00 - thuggish ruggish.... or other sh!t --  WE need a BONE-THUGS remix-version NOW.!!!!!
Subscribe for the latest Kodak news
Is this the only song cardI b got
U thought i was comin w my old flow
Kodak black is wack and in fact trash
Would have been cold if she had a new verse to go with this
Kodak is remixing a song that was a remix of his song the coonary level is high
tf?? The feature is cardi... not  Kodak.. Kodak featuring cardi
Please let Mixtape Wayne get on this 🙏🏾
Kodak sounds like a guy with a nasal southern accent and he always talks while scrunching his face
Cardi take this *L* for getting influence to make a song from Kodak.
What’s all this beef going on with some dead nigga name joe joe?
This nigga ruined this shit he just trying to make money off her he need to stay broke
Lil Sly-Turn Up Green shot by BWA
I like this as well but I like the original more
Lil JoJo lives on when your a Legend even a sucker can keep your name alive ☆ 
Kodak is not a rapper he is one of those rappers that do that mumble jumbo shit only Kendrick cardi Jayz j Cole and Young ma and Remy ma can rap everyone else sucks ass and has ruined rap forever bcoz rap is not as good as it use to be these new school rappers suck
Bodak- kodak see wat u there wasn't necessary to make a remix cuz of the stupid rhyme
Kodak's voice on this lol too dope
Yasssss u and kodak yall need a song together asap
buying views isnt actually being worth a fuck-itsironic
i feel like i’m too white for this song but it’s still a bop
Who else only came for Kodak verse
Kodak made the song worse
I can't stop listening to this Kodak Black 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 on this track
how can he not match the rhythm of his own song?
this man actually remixed a remix of himself
50secs he🤔 say smoking on jo jo
He fucked her song up
Go sub to my channel 😊🗣& I’ll sub back
i playing blasting on full today when suddenly my neighbor threw a brick through my window,i guess they wanted to hear it better
Yeah don't diss JoJo. Took that shit out real quick
Whos here before a million🙋🏾🙋🏾🙋🏾
I can't fuck with ya no more after ya diss a dead nigga yu fu for dat
try me i do the race like im tay k
Ai saw dis coming bodak yellow Kodak black I mean come on
This is what Ive been waiting for, for like my whole life
who's here before 1 mill
I rather have Cardi \nKodak ruined it for all of us
Of course Kodak is the best part
shitty girl woman trying to create a career being cool in the hood
Who is Jojo and why he smoking on him.I was born in the 60's so.....
Why does it sound like kodack spitting out some nasty shit
How are you going to do a remix to your own song
This sounds like a unknown jacked and rapped over it. Even the mix on his vocals sound like it was layed on top the music with garage band. I wished Atlantic would've invested in this and had a A&R make Kodak create an effort that fits the song.
1.25 speed sound the best imo
She not any good!
it's crazy she only have only 1 hit song cardi come on make more songs that can hit the chart
Card. B. I. No. What. The. Hell. You. Raping. About. What. The hell you. Saying
I love this remix Keep doing ur think Cardi and Kodak Big fan of u guys !
How do you ruin the remix of your own song

Here before 1m?
Loved the footage of Duke at the beginning. \nI'm also trying to decide on whether your porridge is actually 'gloopy' or much closer to 'solid', like a freshly baked flapjack. 😍😊
I think you look so pretty without eyeliner.
love you without the winged liner! makes it so you can really see your eyes ☺️
Yes!! My favorite mascara, and you look great without the winged liner, btw 👍🏼👍🏼
Thumbs up because I'm out in public with dog in my PJs in the morning too! 💗😂
I don't understand, what was raw or unedited about this video? 🤔
No way, I think I will never go out like in this pajama 😂
Please do a health update! Hope you are doing well!
I know I say this all the time but you make me smile and take some of the weight of the world off my shoulders which is a big deal for me.
That make up look is really pretty and you look really preety without winged eyeliner! I mean a lil difference is always gud! And that eyeshadow looks gorgeous without the eyeliner
I genuinely love watching you unedited , I feel like we connect with you on a different level. it's also your really warm personality that shines in this style of a video . more please x \nily \n- z.s
I love this vlog! Seeing Duke on your videos makes me so happy 😊
Hi, loved the vlog. Espécially the fact that you included your health problems in it. I suffer from the same issues. And sometimes I lose hope too. But honestly knowing that influencial people like you fight to find a solution helps me keep faith that one day we'll all be ok. Please continue searching and talking about it. Love.
Can you please do a hair tutorial soon? It looks amazing!! <3
so much nicer without the huge liner. love you🌹
Puppy snuggles are the best in the morning. I can't believe how fast you did your makeup and it looked beautiful. So did your hair and you didn't even have to do it. My new goal... to get ready as fast as you just did. 😀
that lipstick shade looks amazing on you! xx
This lipstick suits you so much Amelia! xx
Thankyou for mentioning its an Ad.
i love what you;re doing on your insta
You sleep in hoops🤤?
Ooh those simple products look awesome!
You look sooooo much more gorg without the winged liners!! It's so effortless and clean!
you should have added some walnuts to the oats!<3
your eyebrows look perfect what is your secret omg
Loved this video
I freakin love apple, cinnamon & oats too 😆❤️
I LOVE gloopy porridge :D
u look like ozut mesil
Love the outfit 💖
Loved this so much! The pjs walking the dog thing in the morning is definitely relateable hahah :))
Great video :) You look beautiful without eye liner. Natural beauty!
Hey Amelia, loved the vlog (as per usual) but maybe a clearer word to use instead of unedited would be unplanned? P. S loving the bright lip and no eyeliner look on you
Perfum collection :)
Omg I love this
I love watching your videos!! So beautiful!! 😍🌻💕 btw, ur my #1 fav YouTuber!! Never dull moments! 😍😍😍💕💕💕💝💝💝
1st comment yay love u Amelia ❤️❤️
Kisses😘
Love it! Where are your hoop bubble earrings from? 😊
I can only eat porridge gloopy too 😊 x
That lip color really suits you!
Pls do more videos with duke! He is so cute!!
Duke is just the cutest and he deserves to eat from gold and diamond plates, if you have them.
But this is a well edited video 🤔
Duke is just too friggin cute,,,
I'm only 1.57 in and I already love you for this video 😍😂
Love you and duke hes too cute and makes my day. i love fast makeup also but i will never be without eyeliner that completes your look always.
Amelia, what earrings are you wearing in your second and third earlobe piercings? Your ear game is always on point 👌🏼💕
I love this video! You are such a joy to watch and yay for listening to us about the no eyeliner! Your eyes are literally to die for! Sending good vibes your way love ❤️
I prefer this type of videos by you. Some of the recent ones were good quality but felt like not so real
That lipstick is very pretty! Lovely shade of red.
I feel happy  to see u unloaded  a video  😍
I absolutely loved your unedited video! Shows your funny, witty and sweet side of you - please more of these real videos :)
Love the honesty!
I couldn't apply makeup if I hadn't had a shower and washed my face first. I couldn't go outside in pyjamas either.
I love how real you are in your videos. You aren't afraid to be goofy and that is awesome!
I love and miss those kind of videos, it's so nice to watch it's so true and simple. I hope you'll do more of these ❤️
Loved and enjoyed this video! When you said that you were headed out with a friend and ending the video, I was like wait- the end already?!! Wasn't ready for it to end. Ready for the next one :-)
Please please please share the nailpolish you're wearing!
nice makeup!fresh and glowy!! your eyes look great without the winged liner!!
What lipliner did you use?! Love the video xx
What was the lip liner used??
Love that lip & top! You also look better without the thick winged eyeliner 😍
I always feel naked when I don't have winged liner. I don't like to wear it for work because it's too intense. But if I take a selfie without it on I think I look weird.
Love it as always!!! 😘❤️👍🏼
This was fun! :) I too was making oatmeal this morning using whatever I could find
I have a video request .. I have just started a tag video and would love for you to take part .. xx
Duke is just too cute😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
love those AL pots! where did you get them?
In my opinion you look so much fresher, more natural and younger without that winged eyeliner 🙂👍
Amelia, what are your thoughts on the gisou hair oil? I want to get it but not sure if I should spend $90 to get it! Is it as amazing as it costs? Or can I find something similar at a lesser price?
LOVE that you go out in your pajamas!!!!!
What did she curl her hair with x
Where are your earrings from at the beginning?
Does anyone know the song?
I love your videos! Ignore the haters xx <3
I love your eye look with out the liner. It makes you look more youthful and fresh!
Love your lip color and your earrings!!
You look so nice when you wake up I am jealous
love your morning dog walk 😚
would you recommend the creme de lamer for very sensitive skin?
Just got bad news today and watching this video really cheered me up and provided much needed distraction. Thank you for being so real. Love you!
Great video❤️
Who helps you film your ootd, do you ask random people on the street? Loving your hair :-) <3
This was soo real,loved it Amelia!! Sending you lots of love x
You are cute~ but when I saw ur dog, you can't beat this cutie of course~ lol
That porridge looks like dog sh*t! Learn to cook woman!
Love watching you! I feel like your personality is so soothing and your channel engages with a lot of people of different ages and backgrounds so I'm forever recommending people to watch your channel 💕
dog was licking ur lips.. yukkkkkkk
Hey Amelia! Where are all of your earrings from?
<3
no shower........
Loved the idea behind this ❤️
I can't believe people actually go outside wearing their pj's! I can't even answer the door in pyjamas. But then I'm old!!
Amelia how do you think the Chanel memory compares colour wise to Charlotte tilbury Bette? They look v similar! Just wondering whether to take the plunge! Xx
It's great to see more of your everyday, at home content👍🏽 ❤️
And when did she have a shower? Just wondering

Gareth Bale what an insane run, that is what we expect, pull out your guns effectively and efficiently. #HalaMadrid
Im convinced that bale is the faster runner in football 100m? 200m? 400? He can run 97.3m in 10 sec effortlessly. If he really try, maybe 100m sprint in 10 secs.
When  bale show us that  he is not Shit.\n\n\n\nI am still waiting for benzema to do it now.
The thumbnail looks like Aaron Ramsey 😂

le réal reste toujours le meilleur
No faltará un mandril diciendo Mayoral balon de oro
Que robo de partido y que albitro mas malo
Y no faltan los que siempre dicen que el Madrid ha robado, es increíble. ¿En serio no podéis admitir nunca que el Madrid ha jugado mejor en vez de decir la robada o chorradas así? Cuánto llorón.
Cuando te dejas caer, finges dolor, das vueltas pero nadie te pela. Minuto 0:48
Esto no es un resumen vaya mierda xd
Buen partido 3 puntos importantes
Q raro el estadio de la real... q hacen unas pocas sillas alla detras y luego nada..
Esos son los vídeos que megustan que subas 👍
Ese es el viejo Bale! Desde atrás le ganó en la carrera y hasta definió finamente sobre el arquero! Ojalá sigas así!
Bale. Es un atleta que sabe que en el fútbol es primordial

Looking really good.
I wanna travel to London and try those cupcakes.
I've been enjoying your channel for several years from Japan! On that day, I made my BF(lives in London) to go to the shop for the dessert and meeting Jemma and he nailed it! Obviously I was so happy that my BF sent my love to Jemma but he was also very happy to meet you and enjoyed your sweets! Thank you very much!! xoxo
I always use my fire lighter XD
😍
Those look delicious. Mmmmmmmmmmm
Your Cupcake Jemma towel 😍
MashAllah
Looks amazing!!

So good to see loads of people coming out to the shop, well done Jemma :) So impressed with your buisniss
I was kind of nervous that the blow torch would set the cardboard alight...
All the up & down stairs must be why you all stay in shape!
Jemma, is Colour Gel bad for buttercream? Will it make it go runny? .. I couldn't find colour paste :(
How do you not burn the paper containers?!?! That’s skillz!!
Too bad I'm in Brazil
Will torching work with Swiss meringue as well? I'm assuming it will but thought I'd ask.
Marie same !!!😃😊
I love these BTS videos because everything always looks so organised!
wow it looks delicious jemma!, congratz!.\ni don't know if you will be able to answer that, but if somebody can answer me this, would be appreciated: in the video jemma says that you need to lick the blowtorch on the italian merengue. this technique changes depending on the merengue, or i can do with any kind of merengues that i want to blowtorch it?
I like this kind of behind the scenes because it includes talking, not just pictures and music :)
Looks like it was a fun day!!!
Alas u were not in😣
I love your videos and your baking wonders Jemma, don't get me wrong but... 1:17 WHO IS THAT MAN ???!!!! The romantic Frenchie I am fell in love, it's settled, done. Cakes and the man.. *-*

People are a bunch of pussies. No one should respond to a little knife by pulling or firing a gun. Huge bitch move. There was obviously no threat to the pigs. Just another coward with a gun.
Was the cop justified in shooting Schultz after was told to stop?\nYes.\nWould it have been better if he had tazed Schultz instead?\nAlso yes.\n\nThat's all, folks.
Police did their job..no one wants to get stabbed..if someone is charging at you with a knife you have every right to defend yourself
Damn trees in the way.... Damn it! It got what IT asked for...
Wah wah wah police didn't try to de-escalate the situation first\nTelling him to drop the knife like a dozen times and trying to get him to tell them his name don't count?
There's a lot of homophobic hate speech going on in this comments section and it's fucked up
He was a... _she_ was... it?  Yeah, _it._  _It_ was a good... _thing?_  Okay, _it_ was good _thing,_ it just got caught up with the wrong crowd.  It was just startin' to get its' life turned around.\n\n*_It dindu nuffin!_*    :'(
please tell me it die
Protesters doing a school shooting
So some gay group on this campus had elected THIS character as their leader??
Mother fuck the police!! 🖕🖕🖕
Go to 1:00 to brighten your day
I feel bad for the police in this situation.
My biggest problem with this is all the people that come in thinking that they know exactly how to handle a knife threat when they've never had to handle a knife threat before
Dumbass asked for it so he got it!
Drop the knife and you live, Walk up on cops with the knife you die.... Simple choice or should have been for someone that is so called educated. Case closed, suicide by cop.
And nothing of value was lost that day
This coward didn't have the balls to take his own life, so he dragged these officers into the final moments of his pathetic existence.
All these tranny freaks need to be put down. Good shoot.
There is no argument here. If you are threatening a police officer, and disobey their commands, you WILL be shot. He committed suicide by cop.
He did say shoot me. Seriously, I know cops get away with fucked up shit but the proof is all there. They warned him, they tried to talk it out, he wasn't listening. If it would have been me in the situation, I would do the same. It's him or me, I kinda like breathing and I was told in police training, they teach you that someone with a knife can close the distance very quickly. Fuck this guy. I would say the same if he was black, proof is there. It's not a race/gender/orientation thing in this case, it's basic logic.
We as a society have to do better period!!!...
What are you going to do? Shoot me? - Quote from man shot.
good for the faggot. one less gay muther fucker in the world
My Coverage Of This:\nhttps://youtu.be/iXodCGzKhpU
You know, another way to handle this would be for the cops to just leave.  Just walk away and leave the freak all alone out there.  It probably would have just sat down on the ground and snowflaked out, and then went back to its dorm to watch Liza Minelli videos.  It wouldn't have hurt anybody - because it's not nice to hurt people.  Its only motive here was to have the cops kill it because it was too much of a sissy to do it itself.  If the cops had just left, we might still have this Girl Scout with us.
Absolutely unnecessary. You can tell by their vocal tones and body language that the cops did not feel this person was a true threat. It sounds like the female officer pulled the trigger. Come on. Body armor, military grade equipment, tazers, possibly non-lethal force weaponry, and you have to shoot an obviously mentally ill person that's holding a multi-tool, with a lethal shot? Sickening.
Mental disorder is a real thing people...
IT IS FUCKING HILARIOUS!!!!!!!!!  DID YOU HEAR THAT FAGGOT COMMUNIST ATHEIST FUCK CALL OUT TO GOD RIGHT BEFORE HE DIED?!?!?! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  OH GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'     OH GOD INDEED MOTHER FUCKER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    ALL YOU LIBERAL REGRESSIVE COMMUNIST TREASONOUS FUCKS DESERVE THE SAME FUCKING FATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Cops made a good job! Respect for them, they gave the chance to that idiot to stop.
Suicide by cop, and he was clearly mentally ill. You can't be non binary just like you can't be a bird no matter how much you feel like one.
This is because American cops are pussies.... Too quick to go for a gun and too scared to take an arse whooping. Then again, same with a lot of the US civilian population too... Too scared to take an arse whooping so to live up to the 'gangsta'/ 'I'm the best in the world'/'unique snowflake attitude a lot of them have thanks to the media, they carry guns to alleviate their shortcomings. \nOver here in the UK, the cop would have just pulled out his side stick and smashed the guy in the face. I've seen it happen a few times with my own eyeballs. The shit has to be hitting the fan to warrant UK police carrying guns. Because of that, a lot of UK police will just rush you at the first moment and beat you down, pin you to the ground and get a few extra sly digs in while you're having handcuffs put on you.\nThe guy in the video was clearly a scrawny weedy looking dude AND the police had at least 60 seconds to assess this. To look him in the eyes. Yeah, he has a blade, but shit reach. The cop had better reach and even more reach with a baton. And the knowledge that stabbings are rarely fatal. And body armour. And a partner with a gun just in case the attempted takedown with a baton didn't work immediately. Also, at that range, there was no reason to not fire three shots at the guys legs. At no point was he moving fast and if you can't hit with 1 of three shots to a 6 inch target (width of average human calf muscle) moving at walking pace at 15m, you shouldn't be allowed to carry a gun. The officer shit himself/herself and immediately and instinctively aimed for centre mass/vital organs. Again, police need to asses the situation. Night time, few people out if any, no one directly behind him or in the immediate area... No worry about discharging 2 or 3 rounds at him. Sure, you can die from a bullet wound to the leg, but that's even less likely than dying from being stabbed. But yet, the officer opened fire. Centre mass... Killed him stone dead. He had time to cry out on the floor like a scared child for a few minutes. \nWell that's the thing; in such a society, you need officers who are brave. Who can take the extra second to assess the situation and not act on instinct. To act on higher rational thinking and motive. Here in the UK, we have a stabbing every 4 minutes... on Average. 130,000 a year. Wanna know how many people die? On average? a little over 200. Its because it takes training and skill or a good bit of luck to effectively kill with a knife. 95% of people don't know how to use one and thus the majority of stabbings are rarely fatal. Now, taking the 60 seconds the officer had to think about it, it doesn't take a genius to figure the threat level was low. \nSo, does a low threat level justify execution? I'd say not.\nSomeone with combat experience would have been able to rationalise that. Then again, the armed police are NOT civilians... Yet you guys keep hiring civilians and giving all of them a gun and thus, death by cop is an easy way out.\nI mean, I understand and all. 2nd amendment, and you'd do well to keep hold of that and not let it go. Hell, if the next Hitler rises, we, the people, here in the UK have nothing but harsh language to oppose him with. The second amendment allows you to fight back if the next Hitler thinks about rising over there. \nIf you have a society that has a lot of guns though, you MUST be more stringent on the kinds of people you allow to carry them. \n\nBrave, just and honest individuals only... Ideally, people with combat experience who have live training in taking the extra second even while the bullets are flying. Its not like you guys don't have a load of vets.
Very clear. The kid is the instigator.  The kid is the aggressor.  The kid fails to follow repeated instructions.  The kid is armed.  The kid asked to be killed.  Antifa lessons to be learned...America will no longer tolerate your shit.  There are lots more, who are not cops, who also have guns.  Think about it next time you try to burn down my family's car or business.
†you can not under stand resurection becauze it waz scout shultz hiz destiny iz to die GET IT†
Nice job. As we can see police do not relish with unleashing violence on even stupid assholes.
The officer that took the shot was an old high-school buddy of mine, I really hope there aren't any repercussions for him. But obviously Scout needed some help. God bless 'em both.
Did anyone else hear a male scream? I definitely heard a man scream...
Suicide by cop. The cowards way out. Don't have the balls to do it yourself, have to ruin somebody else's life too. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. And what retarded argument is It wasn't even a real knife, it was a multitool!? Have you not seen a Leatherman's blade?
listen to that panzy ass after getting what she wanted *shouldve double tapped there boss
Dumb retard tranny deserved to get shot. The tranny said Shoot Me . So they fucking shot it. Who the fuck cares
what I don't get is why they waited to shot until the point of no return,\naka when their own safety was at risk,\n\nOne officer could have warned him at let's say the 10-meter mark, or maybe even 15\nand after 3 ignored order at dropping the knife, they could have shot him in a non-lethal area, like the Legs, arm, shoulder\n\nPerhaps even have one officer with a trained gun on him, and one other going for a taser, \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not saying they Cop are to blame for acting with force, I just don't understand why they let him get that close when he clearly wasn't rushing, and just walking normally at a normal pace towards them
fucking RUSSIANS everywhere. But WHY couldnt that BITCH COP shoot him in the leg or shoulder at SUCH CLOSE RANGE !! lol.. womenzes and guns.. and CUNTS as COPS .. a bad combination. Cunts should NEVER BE ALLOWED to have a gun . they already have the ultimate pussy weapon.
Shout out to the guy who recorded this.
talk about excessive use of force
who's the dumbass bitch screaming in the background
That's what you get when you name your children Scout. I blame the parents
There's actually a easy way not to die by cops it's called listening to them
About as clean a shoot as there can be. The kid wanted this. Sorry to his/her family, but this was very much justified.
Scout was just mad because the officer didn't reference him with the proper pronoun I think lol enjoy your day libtards
See cops shoot white people too...just saying
I would have aimed between the eyes.
Are k9 units even a thing in the U.S? Why werent they called to assist?? I dont believe a bullet is the answer for everything.
He ain't no michael Brown, nigga.
LGBT community should realize that if someone is willing to change their gender then they are severely mentally ill and are plagued by depression and self-loathing. Scout died because of your backwards beliefs. Scout should have been in Therapy but you guys think that's fascism.
That's what he gets for not dropping the knife period.
Time to loot and riot!!!!!1111\n\nOh nevermind, it's time to play GTA5 !!!
1:08  Crying like a little bitch. I got shot in Iraq and I didn't whine like this...... Of course, come to think of it; I was wearing Kevlar and all I ended up with was a gnarly bruise on my stomach.... And I did get to go to the infirmary where there was air conditioning and chocolate cake..... And my wound wasn't even bad enough to warrant a Purple Heart.... And I actually didn't have any long term disability or even a cool scar; just a bruise for like 2 weeks. But still; this guy's a pussy. Man up for fuck's sake.
And here is a prime example that these he/she's have a mental illness. Just think, Obama was going to let a creature like this join the military!!!😂😂😂😂😂
And they are protesting this? They get no sympathy from me.
Oh! You were told twice to put down your boyscout knife and you didn't do it so you must die! Can you imagine if workers in a mental institution had this threshold? Ninety percent of patients would never get out alive. No one said being a cop was easy. But if you can't deal with a troubled kid slow walking with a Swiss army type knife without killing her or him or whatever it is TURN IN YOUR FUCKING BADGE. I blame black lives matter for this. They have been so insane in their screaming over every death that they have made otherwise reasonable people think it's ok for a cop to kill a confused kid not slowly walking.
I wish the tree wasn't in the way, I wanted to see it happen.
why shoot somewhere fatal - when you could just shoot at their legs/arms/whatever. If they're still dangerous after that then go ahead but c'mon...
I am sorry but this has nothing to do with LGBT. I am also gay, but I can't really feel sorry for this girl. If you are idiot enough to attack the police with a weapon, unfortunately you have to deal with the consequences. Those who are demonstrating and protesting today referring to inequality and LGBT rights blablabla, don't do it, because 1) you are totally wrong, this case has nothing to do with LGBT 2) you are embarrassing  other members of LGBT with your behaviour (e.g. myself) and doing something wrong to the community....\nPlease, if you also lost your mind like this girl, and you are planning on launching the 3rd world war on police, do not fight for LGBT rights beforehand, or say publicly that you are gay / lesbian. Thanks ,)
Good riddance. The only good ANTIFA is dead ANTIFA.\nI hope they identify as a dead motha'fucka, cuz that's all they are now.
We are living in a military state.  The rights of We The People have been superseded by They The Pigs.  American Pig-Police are allowed to murder molest and brutalize with complete impunity.  How about the Law Enforcement Accountability Act whereby when a Pig murders someone when their life is not in danger, the same is exacted on one of their family members.  This Pig's should have his son or daughter dragged out a shot dead right in front of him.  That would be delivering the same justice on The Pig and his family that he doled out to Scout and his family.  What's going to happen to the Pig? Absolutely Nothing.   Welcome to the new america.
Here's what I don't get about these situations...  Yes, this lunatic was indeed a lunatic coming after the cops with a weapon and use of force should be considered and some is absolutely justified.\n\nThis tranny was no real threat to the officers though.  Certainly not so much to justify deadly force as a first option.  I hate that cops can use the get out of jail free phrase I feared for my safety.  Should police not have to accept more risk than an average citizen?\n\nWhy no tazer?  Why not tackle it from behind?  Why not pepper spray it?  Why not shoot it in the leg as it lumbers towards you?
More proof of the statistic that roughly 41% of those suffering from gender dysphoria commit suicide. \nWhen are we going to help people who need it instead of lying to them? This is inhumane.
I guess he/she was expecting some kind of act of sympathy from the cops. Mentally ill person act like their victims, but in reality, they're the predators seeking for favors and sympathy from others using their low self esteem and victim mindset.
For anyone who thinks a knife (or any weapon in the hand) is not a deadly threat, look up the 21 ft. rule
I get that a knife is a deadly weapon that could easily of killed then with a poke but couldn't they just shoot him once or twice in both legs? Anyways if that's not a possible solution I guess the local Georgian officers did what they could. Sad story.
A female cop shot him? The march of progress! All those protesters should be celebrating.
And the Darwin Award goes to!
Some police men somewhere in the country need to lose their lives over this. The problem is the ones who end up dead are the nice ones.
I doubt many students know about what happened at Kent State University on May 4, 1970 when 4 students were shot dead and 9 others injured when Ohio National Guard opened fire on a group of students protesting the US bombing of Cambodia during the long and disastrous Vietnam war. But once again, over zealous men with badges over react and use deadly force in the wrong situation. Obey my commands or else die is what the government wants - total control over us. And those commands are coming at us faster all the time. It's only the beginning and it's going to get a lot worse unless we get our congressmen to step up and see this for the police state that it is.
I don't understand the outrage. We allow Cops authority over us when they are on duty because they keep us safe. That is the compromise we agree to with the cops! So when you don't respect that authority and get shot.......
He failed to comply, he got killed...that's what happens. Why are these college idiots rioting? Imagine if this guy was black, the whole city would be on fire.
Na Na Na Na. Na Na Na Na. Hey hey hey. Goodbye.
Well done
Meh, had it coming
suicide by cop
us became hardcore isramic country.
HAHA.  One less faggot liberal.
Doesnt matter that theyre gay, cops, or whatever. Theyre dumb.
BAWAHAHAHAHA !!!!!!!
Such a waste
Good riddance!
Good riddance.
lol get rekt
Haahahahahaa Good! These idiots should not reproduce.
Do stupid things, win stupid prizes. \nNext!
Natural selection.
Suicide by cop
Prepare yourselves for gay riots.
This started a riot? Pathetic.
Moron deserved it.
It looks like he wanted the cops to shoot him. Either that or he was on drugs. Seriously, who walks towards cops with guns drawn and expects a good outcome?!
they could've shot him in the leg, ended the threat instead of his life.
The US Police seem to forget they are there to serve and protect. Why on earth would you need to shoot somebody with a knife in the chest? Shoot them in the leg, shatter their kneecap if necessary, but no need to kill them.
This is why Capitalism has nothing to do with Gay & Queer + Liberation! Police are the Enemey of our Movement since before Stonewall!
Why didn't the police just shoot the legs?
who put a gun to anna wintour's head to say those things about body image lmao
Anna Wintour has been at vogue since 1988, and only now is talking about 'body image'. smh.
If that's not the pot calling the kettle black. If Vogue wanted a variety of body types on the runway, they should have started with their magazine. And no, I don't mean a tokenized yearly issue.
Somehow ironic since they're still photoshopping the girls in Vogue!!! 🤔
clicked so fast. devil wears prada.
Is she really lecturing designers about body image ?! I mean, look at your magazine woman !!! Incredible !
I feel like these videos are completely different from Vogue magazine. When I pick up a Vogue magazine I feel overwhelmed and exhausted.
I am confused ...it's not just Britain and our fashion week who idealise the skinny woman it's 99% of the fashion industry including magazines
These videos are nice, it's cool to have an editor in chief talk about how she felt about the different trends seen at fashion weeks. Though I have to call bullshit on her feelings towards body positivity.
Weird! I remember you criticizing Jennifer Garner for looking pregnant and then asking to retouch an image of a model who you thought looked not as thin. All of this was in The September Issue.
I can't believe Vogue would upload this, I mean do they think were stupid. Who in the world thinks were going to see models walking the runway any bigger than a size 2 (maybe). And for her to say this as her bones are perturbed and she probably eats a cliche of a cube of cheese for each meal.
Anna the Genius.
Wintour may not believe in what she said about body image but doesn't mean what she said isn't true.
She can sing the hymn of nepotism! No skill, education, nor style but destroying Vogue and fashion since 1988... boring!
That fucking arrogant grandma is still alive & talks about body image? Die A.S.A.P., you fugly hypocritical libtard.
If i hear ingenuity and optimism from one more of her videos though...
So sick of her.
Translation: They tried, but not hard enough. also the burberry show was aweful
Seriously Anna, a bit late in the game to be talking about stick thin models and body image....shame on you!
I really love Anna showing her perspective about tendencies and making her points to the designers. She knows exactly where the world is going and off course that includes fashion!!!.... moreeeeee!!!!!
Absolutely Love Anna ♥️
Only Gareth Pugh made sense
Lol
I disagree a lot with the phrase you have to be thin to be cool that's not make sense
i can listen to this smart lady all day
Love you Anna for talking about body image and love those videos 😄😍
I like how she (finally) realized the huge issue of sizes in models, and I really hope and think that it's finally gonna start to change in the next few years.
thin girls,,,,, I think you mean petite girls , Annal,,,,,,,,, ok,,,,,,,,, so you, you and you can go park ya fat crackers over there and leave '''''''all the pretty pretty''''''' to me............ lololol.........
Oh shit here we go. Now Anna is getting on the fat positivity bullshit train. Choo choo baby. Ride that train into irrelevancy Anna. You're getting old anyway. Don't blame you.
Christopher Kane isn't English
Anna is THE QUEEN 😍😍😍
I want more like this of Anna every fashion week 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼👸🏻
Yaass anna
Thin models is so 200Over
good. 😉😉😉
😍
YASSS ANNA!
♥️♥️♥️
she needs to RETIRE. she is no longer bringing anything new to the table.
I wear my sunglasses at night... Get over yourself, old broad. You ain't all that.
Yes true the image is not so okay 👀
wtf has it got to do with Richard Madeley or anybody else for that matter?
Who? Why is this important?
they're two adults forming a relashionship, nobody on this earth has the right to say anything.
What happened to Lorraine Etherington who was engaged to Bronson a couple of years back?
Anybody would attack if you've being locked up for that amount of time , when he should be out , an what's he going to say when he see luton , fuck me were you dropped me off ? Paki fucking stan , all I want is a apple pie not a bloody curry an loads of fucking sex cases
Richard Madeley is a stuttering gibberish bell end and what’s more the cock twat got his facts wrong lol numpty
Coming from this guy \n Hes a shoplifter
Piers Morgan number 2.. What a prick!!!
Id love his porn tash around the base of my meaty length.
Has there been a helium leak.........pssssssssss
He’s never getting out of jail and she’s just a fame whore
Think Richards been taking tips off Piers Morgan lol
Why are all these 2k views videos in the trending tab all of a sudden? How is this #27 in trending?
fiance? hes been inside for 30 years.. so she got with him outta clout? women are weirdos hahahaha
Fiancee lol ok. He's never getting out, pointless.
When did Richard become such a gobby, shitty presenter? Maybe I was just too young & naive in my childhood to fully be aware of how he presented This Morning with Judy, but I don’t ever recall him having this much of a cocky arrogance about him.\nHe’s not asking questions from the public, he’s projecting his own opinions onto her & using that as an excuse, that’s poor journalism & completely unprofessional. \n\nNo one has the right to tell her who she can & can’t love.It’s not about acceptability, no one has to accept it, it’s their lives, & they have the freedom to do whatever they choose to with their emotions & feelings.
Richard is a complete dick.
Tony bhlair is a bigger criminal than this guy....
Charles Bronson is a fucking scumbag, let the cunt rot in jail. This dopey bitch gets all wet over violent men!? Send her to the Jihadis. ANd to all you pathetic dimwits who idolise this cretin; EAT MY SHIT!
Richard should stick to shop lifting wine from Tesco. Always thought he was a shitty presenter, I wonder how is alcoholic wife is doing?
They invite this women to come on their show for an interview and general talk about her relationship.  Why is the host not being a host and starting arguments. His opinion should be neutral no matter what his personal views. \n\nThis is just pathetic and I feel sorry that women had to go through that interrogation. \n\nHe is a full on posh beta cuck that says anything to please the majority.
game of thrones sucks\n couldn't even finish the 1st episode
Eddie you're talking about fuckin dragons and riding them???? Dragons not fuckin real. Lol. But Eddie spoilt it for me with dragon dragged out of the water. Maybe earth is flat??? Lol
Khaleesi dropping a deuce(getting diarhhea) was descrbied in vivid detail in one of the books.
We don't know for sure if the White Walkers can't swim, just that the zombies can't swim. I could see one or two White Walkers swimming down there and attaching some chains to a dragon. Then the wights are just on pull duty.
eddie fucking bravo is on the next level
Hodor's gonna come back and bitch-slap stupid Bran.
if you throw a glock into a swimming pool I can go in and get it but if you take off on a speed boat across the ocean I can't get you... pretty obvious
they snagged the dragon with a hook!!!!
They have shown they can't swim but CAN enter water. Wasting thousands to kill 5 guys = not worth it. Wasting a few dozen to rez a dragon = worth it.
They dropped the chains down with anchor style hooks, and dragged it out you could have pulled the chains truller style, so with enough of them it would be easy to drag the dragons out using the chains without entering the water.
sorry i have to do this eddie but you dont know shit about medieval fantasy. THEY SUMMONED it. loook into it.
I understand the show version. Book version is way more thought out but i drive most of the day for work and audible is awsome. I know alot of show watchers cant read or (listen) but it makes more sense
There was already a bunch of Deadites at the bottom of the lake from the battle, right? Case solved.
Obviously they let the giant tie the dragon, the water wasn't probably very deep. He's strong enough to carry the chain and he's tall enough to not just drown, assuming the water isnt extremely deep he could stand in the water, unlike the normal white walkers who would just sink to the bottom
I don't like how so many people don't see the difference between white walkers and the Others
In a world where dragons, wizards and other magical things exist Eddie is questioning how'd the chains get down there? Lolz
They just sink. There's nothing about water specifically that hurts them.
A Dragon blew up Tower 6!
Well if it's Redondo Beach to Hollywood, the armies can take the freeways so it's much faster.
Someone in the comments section said that, since the Night King was likely a sorcerer, he was probably able to create chains from magic.
So here is my theory for Eddie Bravo, I hope you see this. It seems that the white walker commanders have the same type of remote viewing ability and all knowing ability that Bran possesses as the Ravens Eye or w/e the fuck it's called. So that tells me that the commanders knew about the entire plan, as well as the dragons, and they chose not to advance on the group and didn't not advance because they couldn't, it seemed they were completely capable of killing that entire group including jon snow whenever they wanted to, they used that group to bait out the dragons so they could kill and revive one. That answers that part. In terms of how they are moving the big heavy dragons, they have Giants. Also in terms of who as you put it scuba dived down to put the chains on to begin with, I have to assume it was someone from the command of the white walker army being as they clearly possess abilities and greater powers than the zombies, as you can see they killed the dragon with one shot from a spear thrown from his hand, they could have clearly and easily killed all of the people stranded. So , I don't think there are quite as many holes as you think, I think the real only question would be exactly how they got the chains down to begin with, but that could be explained through the greater power and magic of the white walker commanders.
Rome had a sanitation system; medieval cities did not.
Where the fuck did the chains come from in the 1st place? 🤔
There were plenty of wights that fell in the water during the fighting that chained the dragon , as for the chains the knight king got them from hardhome as he can see events in the past and future like bran he knew he'd need them .
It's never been established that wights can't go in the water. They said that wights don't swim. They were able to get the chains around the dragons because the wights sank to the bottom where the dragon was, & put the chains around it. Then a whole bunch of wights above pulled it out.
Skeletons and rotting bodies can't float.... so it was pointless for them to chase them in to the water they would just sink.\nBut they can just drop them straight down the hole and they sink to where the dragon is.\n\nBut yeah, the chains..... no idea.
Do they think game of thrones is real?
Eddie Bravo is a genius!
This dude is half a tard. I'm supposed to respect his opinion because he's good at jujitsu? GTFO.
Those white walkers were sacrified basically and will forever be stuck at the bottom. This argument has already been disproved.
The giant did it
Can someone tell Eddie Bravo that Wights are twice as strong as what they were when they were alive -.-.  Even says it in the books
Now I've seen it all. Grown ass men talking about Dragons.
What episode is this
Eddie really pissed me off this podcast, unfortunately.. He's so simple minded and made Joe and the others believe the shit he was talking.\n\n1. White walkers and Whites can go in water, they just can't swim... They sink to the bottom, as they're all bones with absolutely no buoyancy. They stopped at the water in season 6 because they were facing an open ocean and realised it would be impossible to get onto a boat. \n- Undead Giants, as well as HOW EVER MANY Wights, drop the chain down to the dragon in the water, they don't need to breath so they go down and place the chain around the dragon.. It's simple.\n\n2. But man, they are traveling too damn quick - Do you want to sit and watch constant traveling with unnecessary dialogue, or would you prefer to get straight to the important action and context? \n\nIt's like Eddie gave ever fibre of his brain to being focused on Jiu Jitsu that he became mentally retarded
Is this guy applying logic to a tv show about ice zombies
The leaders are all women including Jon snow\n❄.rogans is the worst mockingbird gatekeeper on you tube.but I suppose they need the fake fighting followers of dumb to be led by fake dumb...
They can go in water, they just can't swim.
I'm assuming the skeletons can climb the chains to get back out? What's so logical about what Eddie said? If anything this is proof that he doesn't think things through enough.
GOT became shite since G R.R Martin left it to those 2 twits.
Giants can swim says it in the books
maybe they cant swim but they can 100% at least walk under water, they tried to pull tormund under water in the beyond the wall episode
I love how this show's hype train got bigger and bigger with every season, and the quality of the show dropping like in the same amount.
I'm going to assume that white walkers took chains with them and sank to the bottom and put the chains on the dragon. I mean duh. They are dead, and don't care about dying. For a dragon the Night King probably would be willing to sink some of his legion to the bottom of the lake. Duh
Ancient Roman often has very sophisticated sewage systems which are still better than in large parts of the world today.\nThere are even aqueducts in France and Istanbul and are still actually functioning.
Just walking, not shitting God this was Eddie being on point
The scene when they pulled out the dragon with those chains reminds me of the first time I saw WTC 7 collapse.
The white walkers cant swim they never said they cant go in the water they said they cant swim
they freeze in water
Eddie is the biggest fucking idiot I've had the displeasure of listening to. It wouldn't be so bad but he NEVER shuts the fuck up
the fact they fucked this up this hard totally ok's the spoilerage
Has Eddie ever heard of a big treble hook the dragon is dead so who cares if it gets a big hook hole
Even though Eddie is a fucking retard, he is funny as fuck!!!
Ice king is an old 3 eyed raven and sees all like bran and therefore predicted all this hence - mfucker brought chains n anti dragon ballistics (spears).
They are just having fun why so hate ?
It was probably the giants
cant wait for all season to go in 4k dvd
If the White Walkers can raise Mammoths and Dragons as wights, they should raise a bunch of rats and squirrels. They could infiltrate the Night's Watch encampments while they sleep and rip open their jugulars.
They can't get into water, yet they come up out of the water to try and drown Tormund. And they did not check the water once in a while to see if it was frozen?
Guest looks like he's about to cry from stress defending GOT
Westeros has a fast travel and quest marker system built in it
Eddie Bravo is a *legend*
I don't know what it is but I hate guys who call her Khaleesi.
EDDIE SO WRONG ABOUT THIS SHIT\nThere are whites and white walkers. The army of the dead, the whites, the zombie guys, can't go in the water. The white walkers are the dudes literally made of ice like the night king, they can definitely go in the water plus they're super strong.
Where do they take their shits?  True enough, a good few hours in survival school was spent going over tactical elimination.  No one wants to get sniped with their ass out.
I 100% said the exact same thing as Eddie first time I saw that scene. lol. Also they travel thousands of miles in minutes. Not an absolute game breaker and it is a show so it is what it is i guess.
Damn u people are stupid.  The white walkers and the army of the dead cant swim BUT THEY CANT DRAWN EITHER!!  Now u get it?  Dummy
A minute in and its hilarious already kek
But wouldn't the theory that the Night King has vision powers like Bran and it was all a set up to get a Dragon explain the first part they were talking about with going in the water?
hahaha eddies the best
Edgy Brah pointin' out plot holes in ALL official narratives
Enjoyed the video!
The night king can worg into the  white walkers, thats how he controls them. They can do whatever he wants them to do.
Eddie looks well smart with his Hitler haircut.
Fix your headset and wear it correctly you bald fuck!
its a fucking show lmao the little details dont matter
First time Eddie Bravo got it exactly right!!!!
They don't float you idiot. They can just send a few dead people down with chains, they'll sink to the bottom, then tie up the dragon with the giant chains they pulled out of their ass.
Its not a plot hole if you consider that the Knight King was waiting for the dragons to show up by surrounding the group.
Exactly what I said when i saw it. Eddie pointed to the massive problem with how they pulled the dragon out of water. This 10 min clip had me rolling
If they explained everything like pooping and drinking water game of thrones would be boring lol
Dead people Draggin´the Dragon... say that Over and Over Faster Faster Faster!!!!
never established the night king or white walkers cant swim
At the end of dance of dragons, khallesi does take a shit
Its never said in the show that wights or white walkers can't go in water. But then again this coming from two people who can't work out why its illegal to strike to the back of the head in mma...
if the wights sink then how the hell did they grab jon's leg through the ice?

I liked the show better in the earlier seasons when it was all about the politics of King's Landing and the War of 5 Kings or whatever it's called.  Joffrey was the perfect villain.  I still love the show now but that's just my opinion.

they can't swim because they are zombies but they can still go into water.
Good points.
God dammit! Eddie is right!

Check out my pickle rick anime crossover edit.
We're not going to talk about how Summer went from annoyed teenager in season 1 to badass that saves Rick and Morty both daily in season 3?
Girlfreind.exe has crashed
lol @ the bots and the paid shills in the comments pretending like they genuinely enjoyed this GARBAGE video. Absolutely disgusting.
Oh jeez oh man, my name is Morty and I'm 45 years. I realized I started looking like my grandpa rick. 10 years later I figured out I'm actually rick, and I'm supposed to travel back in time and raise myself so I can continue the non-stop party that is me, the infinite rick.
Rick not a dynamic type character, no matter what, he still the same, because he Rick! And Rick not really like changing his character, and he can fourth wall breaking to see that.
BUT THATS JUST A JERRY!
yeah, it's called charecter development
I really relate to Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty. I’m nowhere near that intelligent - he’s an impossibly smart supergenius, so nobody is, and anyone who says otherwise is lying, especially if they’re saying they’re that intelligent. \n\nBut I do understand the depression that comes from being more intelligent than the majority of people in the world. You know things could be so much better if people could just see what you see and know what you know. And because you know things could be better, every sign that things are not getting better (or are getting worse) hurts your heart and makes getting through the day a Sisyphean slog. So you shut down your ability to care in order to survive, but it keeps popping back up no matter how hard you try to shove it down.\n\nI have a theory about Rick, that’s based on the fact I know something of the way he feels. My theory is that he DOES care, he just pretends he doesn’t, and often acts like he doesn’t, because the sheer psychological weight of how much he cares makes him suicidal and homicidal. There are little signs here and there in the series that he really does care, like how he keeps rescuing Morty, how he took down the intergalactic government (the act of someone who believes the world will be better off without it), some of the mind probe scenes from the first Evil Morty episode, and others. I’d have to scour the series again for more evidence.
Actually he hasn't changed at all. It was established in season 1 that he cares about his grandkids.
these people are not woke enough about rick and morty. Rick at the beginning of season 1 is rick from different dimension than that of the rick that we are currently seeing. the rick we are currently seeing is the rickest rick, he's a rogue rick, cares ab his grandchildren. but he's still fucking crazy and toxic as any of the many ricks. the rick from now, and the rick from the beginning, are literally not the same person because they are from two different dimension. it's just a different version of rick.. he hasn't actually changed. I think the creators are just showing us a lot more about rick as they continue to develop his character, but it is not about rick changing and become a caring guy c'mon, cliche much ??? It's about toxic relationships and nihilism and rick's truth be exposed. pay attention the the details read between the lines and you see this so easy. the writers are smart as fuck and they gotta be doing acid o some shit lol
I fucking hate the rick and morty fanbase this video is shit itsjust explaining the obvious people eat this shit up
So far season 3 has been a major disappointment except the Evil Morty episode, but other than that the whole thing has been a train wreck. It only made me hate Rick's family even more and more and rick himself too. How fucked up a family can be? S1 and S2 showed togetherness and family bonds, but not this season. It only showed that every family member is one giant arsehole to each other. Beth have daddy issues, Summer has typical teenage issues, Morty has become cold hearted and Rick is the most changed person out of all. I have lost the count as for how many times he has basically left his family members to die or rot for his own selfishness.
No he didn’t
Technically, unity is just a disease. It is kinda genderless.
In the Vindicators episode, sober Rick is the one to point out the possibility that drunk Rick was doing these things because he cares about Morty. I get all emotional when I'm drunk. So he's acknowledging and admitting, even if drunk Rick  doesn't think that way, it doesn't mean he doesn't care as a whole. In fact, I think it means MORE that he admits it while sober. Rest and Ricklaxation was a pretty huge development as well, in my opinion. Pretty blatant, don't you think? The most recent episode shows a lot of caring as well, holding Morty when he is distressed, and removing painful memories to comfort him when, if you think about it, he didn't have to. (Of course, in some cases he also did it to be selfish, but that's another discussion entirely. I may make a video about it, who knows?)\nMy point is, I think season 3 is establishing that his uncaring wall is breaking down. The up and down wave is still going on, but that doesn't mean the wave isn't changing course. I hope Rick can find contentment in the end. I think we all do. It's probably going to be a really long development stretching over the whole series.
Theirs only been like 30 episodes and each one picks off exactly the next day where the previous left off. Thats about a month, so how can anyone say they even know rick to begin with.
I wouldn't call this a change. I honestly believe that Rick has always been fluctuating between caring/loving his family and his nihilistic worldview. It's just that we, as an audience, are beginning to see some of these fluctuations.
I feel like Rick is becoming good as much as Morty is becoming bad
The bigest question isn't this it is evil morty orgins
What if when Rick goes to confront the new president of The Citadel (Evil Morty), he can't kill  Evil Morty because it's a younger version of himself and is in fact his original Morty. However Evil Morty can kill Rick because it is an older version of  himself and thus it wouldn't affect him at that point. After Evil Morty Kills Rick he changes his way and eventually decides to take care of the Morty that we have seen in season three trying to be a better Rick. I know this theory is pretty off but i'm sure if you try and elaborate it could become a decent plausible theory. If this theory becomes bigger i am the first person to do it on September 20th 2017.
wait so did Rick even create the portal gun or did he steal it from someone else if the backstory in s3e1 is all false???
Me: I'm going to bed at a reasonable time. \nMe @ 1am: Rick and Morty: Has Rick Changed?
#36 on trending 🙌🏻\nLove the video
I care about my personal space.
I'm 4.01 in and what is your fucking point?? Wubbalubbadubdub
Did you just assume Unity's gender as FEMALE!!?
In the vindicators episode  the machine accepted morty Even then saying that was nub nub , that was Made to accept morty not nub nub
Who else watched this and thought oh yeah i forgot, jarry wait no, jurry NO ITS,jarry oml i forgot WAIT JERRY YEAH THAT
Wait did the creator of the show state the earth was cooling
Ew a female\n\n\n\n\nJk I don't care
Rick's lack of emotions, or masking of it, is a defence mechanism. There are people in real life that do this and even I do it to a certain extent, just nowhere near as extreme... I hope. There's a term for it in psychology, but I forget the term. Apparently, if someone deduces everything to logic and tries to ignore any emotional aspect of a situation it becomes hard to counsel them and so a different strategy must be executed. I think this premise was kind of illustrated in the episode with the psychiatrist where Rick was the master of his universe, but also ironically slathered in rat blood and shit. He's a genius beyond comprehension yet he fails to realise his family is suffering and taking the brunt of his careless actions, which doesn't take a genius to realise.
We've seen him act different at different times because he's in different moods, just like everyone else on the show and people in real life. Wow every comment here says show more replies.
Surely due to the nature of Rick & Morty there are infinite Ricks so assuming Rick is changing is an invalid argument to have?
This is a brilliant video!  Excellent analysis.
Avenging my dead family....wow I didn't catch that the first time I saw that episode
I fucking love Rick and Morty
For the noob noob part I think it's important to remember that sober rick thought that morty was the answer because it was the reason he got drunk in the first place
Who thinks about this? Just watch the show, stop looking for something in it.
In M.night sham-aliens there's a scene in which Rick is playing with morty while collecting the crystals. At the end of the episode it's implied that Rick knew he was in a simulation the whole time so, rick was aware that the morty he appeared to be having genuine fun with was a simulation. To me, this scene speaks to rick's character, he does want to have an emotional connection to morty but, he's too cold and detached to actually have one. I think he chose to experience the feeling of having a connection with morty within the simulation instead of the real morty.
Come on down to lil bits
That thing with Mortys brainwaves cancelling out Ricks doesn't have to mean his stupidity is what causes it. If it was then I think Rick would just come out and say something like it's because your an idiot Morty but he doesn't, instead he says Morty waves and since when has Rick ever cared about Mortys feelings as seen in the start of season 2 as time is literally falling apart he stops to call Summer and Morty pieces of shit. Also when Morty ask Rick and what makes them different he just dances around the question and moves on. I think there might be more to these Morty waves than Rick let on.
Anyone know what the music is at 8:40 ?
I Believe rick is changing, He fought for earth to not be destroyed. Rick says that there other mortys and summers and especially other versions of his daughter, So it wouldn't matter if rick got the earth destroyed or decided to leave, instead of fighting to save it, Because he could of just go get another family. remember, Morty and rick killed there other versions to replace that versions life. So i believe that Rick has a stronger bond with morty than people might think. Sure eh treats morty badly but there ALWAYS a second purpose, He teaching morty about the world and how in every other dimension or planets, life is the same every where.
His voice has changed since the pilot
damn bitch that was deep as fuck
Rick and morty have really switched roles this season. (even tho season 3 has been an origin story)
i think it's because Rick actually did lose his original family. Which he actually stayed with as they grew. He really does care but he can't let himself care because of the constant pain he feels seeing the faces of people he lived with but aren't them anymore in his eyes.
What about the point that everytime he's nice or opens up something bad happens to him example: bird person dies, Jerry tries killing him in season 3
Is it just me or does anybody else wanna see a black  rick and morty lol
What if Rick is still the same and never ch aged and we are just viewing him in a different way.
He used to be more Doc from Back to the Future.
I have definitely noticed a slight change in how Rick treats Morty than how he used to treat him in the previous seasons. He used to treat Morty with absolute distain but kept him around because he was a sort of cloaking device for Rick. But over the seasons, I've noticed that Rick is showing more care towards Morty and even the rest of the family, even though he tries his hardest to make them believe he's just using them for something when he saves them or he just didn't feel like having one of his grandkids die. I once heard a quote from a certain tv series that goes, When people see good, they expect good, and I don't want to have to live up to anybody's expectations. I feel like Rick actually does want to show more care towards his family, but his rude and demeaning nature would just butt in unannounced and hurt his family more, than if he just was cold and demeaning 24/7. That's just a theory, but let me ask this one question: why would Rick show any moments of concern to his family or anyone if he truly didn't care about anyone or anything? Why would he even care to act like a loving grandpa who loves his grandkids sometimes instead of just treating them unkindly and calling them names like normal? Wouldn't that be easier for him? There's also the theory that since he's lonely, he just wants company and is manipulating Summer and Morty to come with him on adventures. But he could just have Noob Noob , Mr.PoopyButthole, or any other creature come with him on his adventures...so that's something to think about.
It was originally going to be called doc and Marty.
And ... what about dont care about this shit and have fun.
he is every way, we're watching one of their stories.
Wow this is the first rick and Morty video I've seen that actually brings up some interesting points. Good job
If all ricks are equally intelligent, then it makes them a majority. A norm, to which one genius is unique in his/her own way, a minority. #fukthesencitadel
Its called slight character development...
Take it to the limit why dont you!
I do love this show. First time I heard about it, I thought it was just a cartoon for very young children. Then as soon I heard the swearing, I was like WOW... OKAY... THAT HAPPENED.
Thought this would be about from the first few episodes to the first fucking god awful wubba lubba dub dub
bipolar in a way
so is he mexican or what
I think Rick is changing but so is Morty. From the series start we slowly watch Ricks care for Morty and the family go from 0 to 10 while Morty does the opposite.
I'm surprised they didn't mention Rick's treatment of Morty in Meeseeks and Destroy after he finds out what happened with King Jellybean, and how he subsequently shoots him out of sight of Morty
When this video is uploaded... Oh oh jeez rick I'm I'm not sure about this
1:22  3:13  I dont remember such episode. Who knows what it is? Thx
He's a one-line joke. Please stop trying to read more into it.
You only have 5 seconds to stay alive!! 😬😬🚀👟 https://youtu.be/Rusn8Bu4qyU\nTurn it up nice and loud 🎼🎧🥁😄
The fan base of R&M is bad, you are the people that ruin the show
I thought rick always cared about his family, he just doesn't show it to them
When r&m fans think they are Intellectuals because they constantly shout wubba lub dub dub and pickle rick
Rick dose care but he has to act like he doesn't care because when he's in deep shit they won't take his family away
Like my latest video and I will sub to you
Is rick a sociopath?

I'm gonna do my homework now\n\n\n\n\n\ngoodbye  :')
So is no one gonna talk about how husky joonie's voice?😍 and how manly jungkook's voice
I showed these lyrics to my mom and she laughed because of how true it is and even thought What a perfect song for you
I followed the sound of the flute and reached Go Go
If they're telling me to not let them completely ruin my life and permanently change my idea of a perfect man then its too late and i cannot be saved. This song is waaay too acccurate lol
*BODYROLLING AND CRYING AT THE SAME TIME* wth guys ;-;
When is this gonna be performed live omg
WHY DO I LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH. EVEN IF ITS JUST THE INTRO I ALREADY LOVE IT
“they totally taken over me!
Suga yeah maybe I'm a little dangerous, little dangerous''\n*I WILL SUE YOU MIN YOONGI*
Did anyone hear a weird noise at the end
I understood the meaning of this song but I still love iit
The only band that can roast their fan and told them to start doing thier normal live couse we can stream their vid later
How in school like kpop then your friend bullying you ????
behind this sweat song, the meaning is so deep, they roast us ARMY oh my god haha, buat bcs this song we also know that bts really now how we live our life.
Jungkook: I'm taking over you\nMe: yes baby....you are(cries and nods)
The first part rapmon has is quite accurate my parents hate bts and I have a bunch of posters. I don't study I go on the v app. Nothing is more accurate
These songs make me close my eyes and go like ahhhhhh SO GOOD
Wtf was that ending😂😂😂😂 no but I liked the song
WELL SHIT WE ARE FULLY EXPOSED FROM MEMES TO ABS SCREENSHOTS COLLECTION TO THEORIES MADE BY THE EINSTEINS ARMY
This song is great please show this song in live,please<3
this song is nothing but the true
They legit are roasting us😂and we ARMYs are also legit loving it😂😂😍💞💘
guys i have to admit i like this more than DNA
I know am late but,damn! I looked at the lyrics and I just sat there like woah.(this makes wanna write a mini story about this XD)
God I fuxking love their whole album
Why are they roasting us but with such a good catchy song i'm confused
So basically once your an army you can't go back 😂 awesome job btw
GOSH i love the tune of this
I love this song the most ❤ after jimin's song serendipity of course. Serendipity is the best 👍👍👍👍❤❤❤❤❤
How can a song's lyrics be so perfect?
Idk, but I can't help but to feel that I'm having a conversation with them in this song, just because the rap part was what I usually do, they're saying sorry for ruining us and I found it really touching, on how they could make a song about us, I'm crying rn, they really care for us..
LIKE THEY RUIN OUR LIVES AND CALL US OUT FOR IT LIKE... OK?!? Love the song btw they are such kings they are able to call out even their fans 😂😂👏
Actually it's not 'Because I can t live without you Because I know'. It's 'Because you can t live without me I know it'
BTS - the only group capable of dissing their own fans LMAO
This song is here to roast us but its also sweet so we cant be mad at them at all uashduah
Here I am jamming to a diss track directed to what I do all the time.
eccusE mE. I dIdn'T asK To Be DRAGGed LiKe THis.
xD \n\nBTS:stop obsessing and go to your studies \n\nARMY: wtf xD \n\nME (also an army): i only did my homework for this reason xD and how can we stop obsessing when you guys are to beautiful xD
I get so many mixed messages from this song first they say can't close your eyes then they say just close your eyes then they say I'm here to save you and then I'm here to ruin you
let's follow the sound of the flute\n*plays the flute*😎
Stan a group that stans you back.
They are really sweet...they shape us
jin's vocals!!!\ni think i died!
So basically jimin's killing us all with his high note
Aww thk u lot 🙆😢😭 bts write song about army us next time if people insult say bts know  me I show this video
did i just get busted because i need to review for my exams but im listening to this right now?
Let's stop looking and start studying for the exams\nme: *choked*
your parents and boss hate me.... IM-
BTS waking me up like this...
lemme go send the lyrics to my parents
I love this song\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* cries at a distance *
*I like it more because its bad You know it deep down*\n*Bulge eyes* WHUT!!?? IM SO GREEN MINDED WHAT THE WTF
*WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE THEM?*
Jin vocals are no Joke
SOMEBODY HOLD ALL OF MY WIGS
This should be ARMY roast song
SUGA'S REFERENCE TO BEING CALLED A DANGEROUS MAN LMAOO
This should be made into an MV about a girl trying to run away from them but the beauty of their music makes her want them more❤
Is this for us... BC its so accurate jfbdknfk. They also know abt them pics oml 😭💓
Is BTS trying to Diss ARMY? Oh god.. *deep deep deep sigh XD WTF?!* That's it ARMY Let's keep down our Fangirl mode!!\n\n*Few moments later*\n\nDNA!!!! \nYOU GOT THE BEST OF ME! \nI'll keep down my fangirl mode. but. NO NOT TODAY!
DAMN Why Kookie sounds so seductive? 😭😭 I shouldn't feel guilty tho since now he's an adult right? His I AM TAKING OVER YOU kills me 😭😭😭😭😭
I'm dead, I'm listening to this in my grave
Jungkook: Don't reject me\nMe: Like someone is going to
BTS is just basically saying that the moment you choose to be an ARMY was the moment you chose to be f**ked up forever.
Can't close your eyes \n\nYES BECAUSE YOU BITCHES CAN SUDDENLY DROP SOME SECRET MIXTAPE AT 4 AM HOW CAN I CLOSE MY EYES-
This track sounds like Calvin Harris & Khalid's Rollin. Never the less definitely digging the song and its funky vibes just like Rollin
Suga is totally a genius. I love his lyrics and the way his rap. Actually three of them are really2 good but suga caught my attention in this album.
Will you forgive me because you can't live without me 😱 I feel so exposed
'I'm taking over you' \nMe: Please oppa ;-;
this is is produced by suga and slow rabbit.😊 i love this song. some people say this is the best song from the album and i agree with it.
WHEN AND WHY IS BTS DISSING US 😂😂😂
Is it weird that I didn't feel dissed, just uh, I feel like they care?
I'm takin' over you that's part basically describes every single ARMY
BTS:I'm watching you. All. The. Time. Just like how you're watching me. (oh so the feeling is mutual XD)
Is it weird that I cried for 20mins cause of this????
Can someone tell me how jimins and jungkook voices got _Higher_
when BTS makes a song for you to study...u literally feel their concern towards u...so they say it and we better throw that god damn phone way to jupiter and study !!! (HEHE.. INTERNAL SCREAMING)
honestly i see in what ways they dissed us, quite hard i might add too cause i mean it's pretty much all true, but they're also looking out for us in a way, when i first listened to the song i got goosebumps, i mean they're basically saying that we should have a life besides just focusing on them and making our whole world revolve around them cause they know that some/most armys do that, yeah it is a bit of a burn cause they're saying they have that control over us but it isn't necessarily false i mean we dedicate so much to these boys, they just want us to be happy with and without them by our sides and i think that's incredibly sweet
All the songs of this album are giving me goosebumps
Лублуууу
노래 완전 좋다
*speechless*
Namjoon the best part
Appreation for Kim Seokjin 😘😘😍😍
lol the lyrics
why this song banned?
Were their paradise 😍

armys: exposed
doesnt 난 너의 paradise means i am your paradise?
oke thats my fav song

BTS giving me mixed signals
아미들의  마음을  제대로아는구만 역시  빅힛 변태

let's stop looking and start studying for exams \nyour parents and boss hate me...\n\nnon-fan here but after listening to this song, fcking jealous of A.R.M.Y !! This song is sooo freakinggggg sweet!!!
Bts: We want to go at BBMAS\nARMYS: Here\nBts: We want 10m views \nArmys: here\nBts: we want to sold 800k \nArmys: here\nBts: Stop and study\nArmys: Know ur limits BTS. And Idk who study is. Is dat a new Group?? Or a song?
The Muslims are at it again!
So fake it's funny.
How did a burning bucket manage to injure 18 people and spew a fireball through carriages if it couldn't make it past a plastic bucket confused...?
In Russia you attack the terrorists
We've gone from flying planes into the Pentagon to a bucket full of fairy lights in a Lidl bag. We just don't have the budget the big American blockbusters have.
what a terrible dumb person to do this,  childish behaviour and all those injuries to people, I saw a couple lad with guys jeans split and loads more with shoes missing,  the initial blast must have been fierce , they all deserve 6 months test and up to 7k in compensation claims
bucket on fire? godda be a damn bomb made by isis
Why would a woman leave her most important possesion her hand bag
Bloody Muslims up to no good again
They all have to go back where they came from.
also known as a bucket, on fire.
FALSE FLAG!   hey London slow down, theses aren't even fooling kids anymore!
Let me guess, the lidl bag had mental problems, and suffered from islamaphobia, the bag will be given counselling and a £5000 payout, sadik khan will hail the bag as a hero
at 0.8 the women must be a member of mensa .or Steve harking teacher ..

HaHaHAHAHAHAHhH only in Britain would they be afraid of a bag on a train that was set on fire HAHAHA NewYork has trains with trash cans on fire every day 😂😂
Let's just go and look at it why don't we....
I wonder if Islamic State took responsibilty for this as it was a complete failiure. Knowing them idiots they probably did.
What kind of idiot gets closer to the still flaming bomb, for a better look.
is it because of the explosion?
, trojan horse you take in teenagers for abroad cloves  them feed them house them and they try to blow up a train full of people
how can 27 people get injured but no damage to the train looks like the bag got burnt with the bomb in
Zero bomb damage on train...
let in a couple hundred thousand more Refugees pretty soon you guys are going to become the Refugees.
oh that bags on fire ?  lets move in closer to get a better look could be a bomb.
I am new so who will subscribe me and give likes on my video I will subscribe him/her return
A gift from the religion of peace
Device~ pile of trash you mean
Media: this terrorist attack has links with Isis \nIsis: someone say terrorist attack?... yeah it was is
and i was wondering why the delay
Oh look, it's a bomb!  Let's go take a selfie with it!
It seem like my lidl bag done suicide.\nYou lived a great life...
Burning device mATE THAT'S A BLOODY BOMB!
The British are gas burning lidi bag on tube (turns terror level to critical)
Im really confused guys, please someone explain whats going on
Wow why do people bring the note 7 on the tube ffs
Oh look, something has exploded.... lets stand and watch it for a bit......
Oh no! the note 7 strikes again!
1 minute silence \nAs we stare at a bag
Oh god the note strikes again
That's the bomb apparently...
At which point did Mr 'Crowley' burn all his hair off.......
Guys I'm doing a legit give away on my channel all you need to do is follow me on sc joe_moakes\nSubscribe \nIt is a iPhone 6s and I pad mini 2
I'm going to guess the ethnicity of the bomber?\n\nChinese? No\n\nOkay then.....Canadian? No.\n\nBritish-white. I mean hell that is the majority of people in the country? No.\n\nHow about Irish? They do have history. No, no the man wasn't Irish?\n\n\nJewish, I bet the bomber was Jewish!!! No, no the bomber wasn't Jewish.\n\n\nHe was a Muslim? Jesus I would have never guessed that. That is so out of character.
Is this the bomb that injured 20 people?
Hey can you lot subscribe and turn on notifications for me and if you do I'll subscribe to you and watch all you videos
This was a set up by the government
Can everyone subscribed to me please I do gaming videos
Well; one things for certain. Lidl bucket sales are going to plummet. You'd better warn anyone who doesn't follow the news not to buy one and take it home using the underground otherwise they are liable to get shot by the Anti-terror squad.
EVERYTIME JUST DROP THE SAME BOMB ON MECCA !!
Some people in the comments are unbelievably stupid. \n\nIt was a fireball, enough to singe light clothing, hair and burn skin, it was hardly napalm. You need to create a long lasting fire to have any damage to the train interior.
Ok so a bomb goes off on the tube, what do you do? You film the flaming leftovers, not knowing how dangerous it still is.
Pray for the 22 injured... 1 like = 1 prayer
I see the bucket was unharmed, and it's surrounding area ...
I guess someone didn't listen to the reviews on the Note 7, smh
Its a lidl bag not a device....
Is that a Galaxy Note 7?
MrShrimpton said it was der Germans.???
The woman who is pointing at the bucket, why is her back splattered with  the milky substance that the bucket supposedly contains and why is she carry a very familiar looking flag with stars, in her hand, was she supposed to be a crisis actor victim and then given another role?
Who is filming this and why .
Divide and conquer.  Conquer then divide some more. Thanks evil govts!
How can a bomb injure 20 people but not even damage the train carriage or even the plastic bag that surrounded it?
Yeah just stand in front and gather around a bomb.
It could be a dildo vibrator that's overheating. That's my surmise.
Such a fake terror event - see Ole Dammegard's work.  This bomb that put so many people in hospital, didn't even throw smut or soot on the adjacent walls, windows or fabric seats of the tube train.  So it can't have exploded or sent fireballs down the train.  It's a shame people got trampled, but this is such a bad hoax.
BREAKING NEWS!!  the bag was completely incinerated, however, the attackers passport managed to be blown to the other side of the cabin from the explosion.... this is the news; we don't lie to you....
What a waste of 10p.
Why is this 1 on trending?
Do you think there was a joker who clicked the assistance button😂😂😂

Lots of comments here trying to be funny but if this device had gone off as intended, everyone on that carriage would be dead.
ISIS Claimed the device, but LIDL beat them to it! £9.99

For all the people saying 'Don't automatically assume it is muslims' or 'you don't know if it was a Muslim' actually, it's been revealed on the news today that it WAS a Muslim, from Iraq so stfu😌 it always is Muslims, I don't know why people are always protecting them and trying to act like they're so innocent, when they're obviously not...
Why is this still trending
did they find tyler in that carriage
Guess who's school was evacuated
If I was them people I would of broke the glass and put that fire out.
Can't be that bad, the train still has its GLASS
19 people involved and burnt alive and yet the bucket and bag is intact..... how gullable are the British

It's important to remember that this was the action of an extremist,  and that he doesn't represent all Muslims. I, a white atheist, think it's important to protect our Muslims friends in the innevitable influx of anti-islamic hate crimes.

Its a marketing strategy, if they pull the product from the market, investors will say its a failure, so they just ignore it and never update it.
Bro i have a mac mini soo....✌
Why aren't they using  an m2 drive  insdie Laptops?
Hey Austin if you make A dsi Worth it video I'll sub and share this video to my friends
There's this thing called eBay, it's a magical website that you can find used stuff on like shitty macs. Don't spend $500 on a brand new turd, just buy a pre-owned one. Or just don't buy a turd at all.
Y does the fitbit exist in 2017?? There are a lot more smart bands which are more accurate and wayy cheaper
Apple sucks big time, they removed the easy memory upgrade options, and stopped release updated hardware versions. They stopped selling the 16gb versions in some countries. Probably, Apple wants to kill most affordable Mac, they have!!
Why does he sound like a higher pitched version of Troy McLure from the Simpsons. He emphasised that start of all his words and then falls off on the end. Should be doing tele shopping channels or something
Can you people get me to 100 subscribers
I still use Mac mini today. It is slow but I don't play fast games and I only need it to rec ROBLOX which isn't that heavy! I never lag and I always use the 2005 version. This tells us a lot about how good steve jobs was.
I actually really doubt it's for consumers. It's probably largely still made specifically for developers. We use a dozen mac minis as Jenkins boxes at my job.
Guys voice is so annoying...in the box. Thouuuuu,   In the boooooxxx,   Why does he drop his voice at the end of almost every sentence
i want to see austin evans shirtless
I had to get the $699 Mac mini because I could not afford an iMac or MacBook
and yet its still more powerful than my pc :(
File pale before convinced handle feed billion revenue love.
love your new outro austin! good work!
The $500 Mac Mini comes with a 1.4 Ghz Dual Core i5. The 2.6 Ghz i5 you listed is for the $700 model.
Why does this channel still exist in 2017?
Short answer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCause apple is brain dead
Lol you can upgrade ram wtf is this fag on about?????
$500, gosh I only paid $79.99 for my 2014 iMac
I would get one if it’s specs were upgraded.
A Mac Mini?\nMust be a tiny burger from McDonalds then.
How did this get onto trending?
Cherdleys in real life
funny in url
It's trash
Because apple fanbois are retarded
Stop editing out your breaths its extremely off putting not to mention unnecessary
Why does Apple still exist in 2017?
Did anyone else see logic in the back
Stop Dancing in the Videos man !!!!
Which keyboard is Austin using with the Mac mini?
Austin Is Awesome
Austin looks like logic
Dear every tech reviewer ever, stop comparing Geekbench results between different architectures (ARM/x86), they aren’t comparable.  At least in the way you are interpreting them.
Logic albums
Cool vid
is he autistic
Why does Austin exist in 2017?
Your voice is so FUCKING annoying!
HEY EVERYONE, PLEASE I NEED YOUR HELP!\n Basically, i was told by my family that i would get a new 8 core processor if i got 100 subs. So please, if you can, subscribe. Everyone helps alot. Thanks! <3\n\n(i know i posted this on another Austin video, but i really need that component ;-;)
They make sleek looking HTPCs, I use the base i3 model for that but it can chug with anything more than Plex running. Which means going for the i5 8GB RAM + version by which point I would say save money and get something else.
I still use a 2014
I still use these in my photo shop class at school.
Watching this on my 2009 Mac Mini lol
slap in 16gb of ram and a SSD usb3 drive ... works fine (late 2012 model)
Why does Austin Evans exist on 2017?
But... who is going to catch me in the next one now? :|
where you keep this reviewed items so many omg😇
Omfg the 'fewer ports ' joke ...why dude so cringe
Some of these shiny millennial channels are unwatchable because of the stupid fast, high pitched voice they put on. He's like a fucking robot that's been programmed to annoy. Sounds like 'What's up guys' la la la la la...
The mini is currently the best (legal) way to host OS X in a datacenter. There are even special rack trays for them.   The Xserve is dead and gone.
Why does Austin Evans exist in 2017?
They exist to be used as a server that's small and low factor enough to be on 24/7 running Mac os server since they got rid of the XServe.
I don't know what's worse. The Mac Mini or your front teeth.
You enunciate at all the wrong times in your sentences. Where were you raised?
Hey guys, this is Austin.
As a fan of you and Vsauce,that ending was super cute <3.
And yet a 3 yr old mac is still infinitely better than most pc trash coming out this year.
His shirt matches the HP Pavilion Wave.
Wow, you don't even get a mouse and keyboard.
I bought 30 of them this summer to mount behind large interactive touch panels. I had to beef up the RAM and order them with SSDs just to make up for the extremely dated internals. I have always loved and used the Minis in different types of structured installs, but they are getting to be harder and harder to recommend. There really isn't any excuse for this either. It would probably take Apple engineers less than a month to sort out even just a Skylake compatible board/chipset and toss a few thunderbolt 3 lanes in there for modern connectivity. \n\nAs it is right now, I can only really use these at 1080p or I see terrible overall system performance. They will push 4k resolutions, but they STRUGGLE. C'mon, Apple!
why does austin evans still exist in 2017?
Cool! I want one!!
Hey Austin I'm a huge fan of yours. I love watching your videos to learn new things. I am very interested in learning about computer software and technology. So your videos are amazing. I'm a junior I'm high school and I am very interested in tech but don't have much money for stuff. Do you have any suggestions?
I highly doubt the iPhone X will even lick the 8,700 mark for multicore. I know they are rumors but come on...
I skipped the latest Mac Mini for the 2012 Mini (since it's easily upgradable). I quadrupled the memory and loaded dual SSDs, it still kicks ass years later. Intel graphics but I don't play games anyway, so I couldn't be happier with this system.
i have mac mini and upgraded to 8 gb (2x4gb ram). I watch all steaming . as for hard drive, i backup to  external disk .  had it over 4 years, no issues and no stupid kb monthly rollups from microsoft
Lmao if you never had one, then you won't ever know
Because it's easier to put a Mini where the sun does not shine, than a iMac.
I rlly like the videos,is a good way to pass time.
Hey Guys, this is an Annoy-o-Tron
Without MacInCloud or a similar service or the use of a VM you'll have trouble uploading an app in to the App Store as it's locked down to only allow uploads from Apple Products (officially that is), that's why. I can think of no other reason.
It exists because apple says we need it
I have the mid 2010 model and it still works perfectly fine for me.
To answer your question, it exists in 2017 because it was released in 2017.
Why do you talk like that, it's weird
My school uses these
Eww a mac
vsauce <3
Curiosity box looks legit
omg the way he talks...Mac miniiiiiii  omggggggg I talk like thiiiissss. videooooossss he kinda sounds retarded no shade
Nerd
What is that
Does he have to talk like that? Super annoying.
I remember when I had one...
Why would you want a Mac mini in the first place?
We use one of these in our office. We are software devs and we use it to build and debug the iOS version of our crossplatform app. We don't need sheer speed for that, only that it runs OSX and will finish compiling C++ at some point (never normally more than 30 mins)
So why does an out dated pc cost 500?
Mac mini’s are apples line of servers. That’s why they still exist since apple discontinued Xserve in 2013.
We got a top of the range Mac mini and it's THE WORST!!!
Im using a mac mini.......
Why does life exist in 2017?
Why does the Middle East exist?
My 2012 Mac mini is still smooth even when editing 4K video. It is actually faster than my custom PC with a quad-core i7 and a GTX 1080 (proof on my channel). \n\nI think Apple should refresh the Mac mini with internals of the new 2017 MacBook Pros + some Thunderbolt 3 ports. That would make it really popular for prosumers and amateur content creators looking to try out macOS. Groups of potential customers Apple seems to be ignoring.
Lol I'm watching this video on a Mac mini
How come he sounds like runs out of battery after every sentence
Why don't you petition for a better one. Rather than moan it's shit! What a waste of time
Album dropping real soon for the past 4 months
MAMA
montreality been killing it with the interviews... killy interview coming soon ?!
I can't wait for astroworld, culture2 and quavo+travis scott album

Come on frankenstein looking ass nigga
Takeoff my favorite Migo 🔥
False accusisations -Takeoff
One day this comment will find itself lost in the comment section
Joe Buddens really turned these niggas around and made them talk more and give better interviews lmaoooooo
Quavo can't roast saying um every other word😭😭
Quavo never had a job. But he damn sure always giving people hard times on theirs. Smh he act super Hollywood now. You're tough son.
Only trend they started was that dumb dab shit as far as their melody and flow goes , BONE THUGS N HARMONY created that sound not Migos 🙄🙄🙄
That cartoon intro is class 👌🏻
I’m dying this Nigga takeoff said “real-ality”
LMAOOOOOO QUAVO ALREADY STARTED OFF LIT 😭😭😭😭
I love their music but their interviews are shit even the one with nardwar. The perky cough sirop lifestyle hits you hard in brain cells. Offset definitely my favourite of the migos, sick verses and chill looking guy.
Offset is the only nigga who aint high asf ry here😂😂
Does anyone know what glasses Takeoff is wearing? They're sexy asf
what? you can tell quavo was inspired by travis w the flow on some songs w culture
Nigga what did you say Lmaoo 2:08 false acussisation 
Migos>Me>Banana
Low key the best Migos interview
Damn Offset hungry. He is eating his dreads at 2:04 !
First interview were takeoff says more than 2 words! Proud!
Takeoff- by 86 I'll be with 86 Chicks nigga 🔥🔥🤙
Reading is lit, though. Gotta read.
travy and quavo needa stop playing and drop the album already
At the age of 86 imma have 86 chicks🤣
If you like discovering new artist check my page @ www.soundcloud.com/canarycolors

Takeoff kinda sounds different on here or maybe it's just me
The heart shaped glasses are the only ones TakeOff rocks now
Do I look like i'm left off Bad & Boujee?
Bitch I'm a dog , Give my treat
I respect Migos mad heavy! Thank you Montreality for the good question
I’ve been listening to Migos since bando, after that everything they put out became 🔥
I see lots of ice in this interview yet I got no Jewels or Gems from it..
Might it occur to yourself I mustn't be forgotten from bæd and bóugé
Quavo is actually a clever guy
Keep a tight circle and set multiple goals, goddam those are some wise words 👆🙏
we must protect the migos at all cost
This channel is slept on
3:13 Quavo just described himself
Offset the lit one\nQuavo the chilled one\nTakeoff the lowkey one
OFFSET DAT NIGGA!
FRIEZA ON MY WRIST\nFRIEZA ON MY NECK\nFRIEZA FRIEZA FRIEZA

They all sound like the same faggy swag rappers out there I don't know what they're talking about. And only hard core pop artists sound like them.
how tf u aint watch dbz and u in your mid to late 20s
Takeoff you were my guy but damn...
Great interview
I wonder if takeoff is going to be left off again?
offset the only good rapper in group. quavo just a hook man. takeoff irrelevant
The South ruined hip-hop.

Migos are shit
We changed hip hop errrrm no dickhead, you ruined it fuckin autotune faggots
Migos stole rich the kidd whole style>> The biting way u aint staRT shit >>>
*doitlooklikeimleftoffbadandboujee?*
Abort takeoff, i repeat abort takeoff.
Takeoff fav glasses he wears 247 never take em off.
This Q&A is the best one ive ever heard so far, made me understood WMD and SMS decisions overall, with that philosophy, im backing them all the way and as a bonus...I now hate EA for ethical reason instead of their bad games lol
6:14:07 he talks how EA killed Shift guys!
That. Was. Fucking. Awesome.
This is amazing. Q&A sold me on the game, thanks Ian and Ozzie.
Aww man, wish I'd been around for this! Great to see Ian doing what he does best (stream/chat/forum bombing), always fun to watch the bossman doing his thing, and great job Ozzie for keeping up with him!
EA = Evil Assholes ? LOL 😉
Legendary interview
Thanks Ozzie for this really fascinating stream. And of course thank you Mr.Bell for the EPIC Q/A session!!!
EA is absolutely disgusting
Time-stamps:\n1:20:00 - Ian Bell joins the Live Chat (On the right Hand Side)\n2:03:20 - Ian Bell joins the Discord Chat (Audio Q/A)\nI wanted to clarify the basis of the interview as I've been asked by a handful of people. There was no prior arrangement made for Ian to come into the stream, it was completely off the cuff which is the surreal part of all of this. I was simply Live Streaming Project Cars 2 and Ian Bell popped up into the live feed chat. I invited Ian to come into Discord which he was an absolute pleasure to have on. \n\nIan was a complete open book - He spoke in great detail about prior business dealing that went awry with EA, growing up in Belfast with his Mum, dating tips for single guys, foreseeable updates for Project Cars 2 and other tidbits! he even strummed his guitar. What's the most amazing part is that he never once ignored any questions that anyone asked for the entire 5 hours he was on mic; respect!\n\nThanks again Ian Bell! It was absolute madness to have you come on the stream to talk to the peeps! :)
Pure Class .
Bell actually comes across decent here tbh. Weird as he always comes across an idiot when reading posts from him over the years but shows how different a person actually is with voice. He seems genuine with passion and i like the way he's says it how it is. Waiting for somebody like Empty Box to give some thoughts before buying as I didn't like PCARS. But still he gained a bit of respect from me here either way.
Legend. I throw something hard and spikey at the person that tries to use anything said in this stream against Ian Bell. Open candid chat like this is becoming rarer and rarer and we all lose more to over bearing political correctness than we take damage from edgy chat. More humanity 4tw!
Stream of the year!
So, a thing Ian clarified, he's really not happy about the opinion of other people hahahaha. Is very subjective the realism feel. It can be awesome, but for some people is just not good enough or just it doesn't feel right, what are you going to do? Kill them? My goodness.\nHe's really arrogant, maybe they have the most advanced physics in the market, but the difference is in how you say things. Plenty of other games had and have racing drivers helping them, but they're not telling, we're elite, we are better than you, if you can't see that you're an idiot. That's precisely why I can't hear him for too long. And even with aaaaaaaall of that, I and many others can't stand playing PCars.
sounds like Ian isn't telling all the truth
Looks like EA secured 'Worst company of the Year' AGAIN with this.\nCongratulations! /slowclap
i was there and he answered my question thank you so much mr Ian for the awesome time you spent with us and im pre loading PC2 now
Wonder how EA will react to this.
Hang on a minute... EA gave him 1.5 million... he blew that money then EA cancelled a game.. I am not really sure what they did wrong. I mean they cancelled a game.. that is it. Ian Bell sounds like a bit of cunt as well.. I mean I understand he is angry but he took the money told them they had access to the tech and then he scammed EA..
Isn't EA heavily associated with Microsoft? Makes sense then.
I like this video but the chase cam + the wheel = ridiculous... :/
it's not even humanly possible to read 150-200 books a year with a schedule like his.
That was excellent, Ian is a legend.
Best stream interview ever. I have supported Project Cars from day 1. Mr Bell sounds like a great man. If more people heard this, I am sure sales would increase massively. I play all the racing games, I play on PC, XBoxone and PS4. Project Cars 2 is the best racing game by far.
This is the best interview ever!!!
Holy shit that got cringey at times but that was so cool.
If you enjoyed the live stream please show your support by leaving a like on the video :) This will assist in more opportunities in the future if it's looked in great favour!\n\nP.s. Ian Bell is the man!
And when we get pCARS 3?!
Fascinating stuff!
more bad things to add onto the pile of how bad ea is.
Whos this dude? Interested in him
And here I am finished listening to the whole ~6hours of Q&A while trying to work. It surprisingly worked out fine. Entertaining AF. Especially Ians laughter.
Great interview.. But, Ian, you've pissed off a lot of Scotsmen and probably your host with the rambling statement regarding the kilt. Perhaps you should read about the Dress Act 1746 mate -\nThat from and after the first day of August, One thousand, seven hundred and forty-six, no man or boy within that part of Britain called Scotland, other than such as shall be employed as Officers and Soldiers in His Majesty's Forces, shall, on any pretext whatever, wear or put on the clothes commonly called Highland clothes (that is to say) the Plaid, Philabeg, or little Kilt, Trowse, Shoulder-belts, or any part whatever of what peculiarly belongs to the Highland Garb; and that no tartan or party-coloured plaid of stuff shall be used for Great Coats or upper coats, and if any such person shall presume after the said first day of August, to wear or put on the aforesaid garment or any part of them, every such person so offending ... For the first offence,shall be liable to be imprisoned for 6 months, and on the second offence, to be transported to any of His Majesty's plantations beyond the seas, there to remain for the space of seven years. \nThe English government have tried to destroy our identity and culture for a very long time,  Saor Alba.
Hey man, it might be beneficial for you to put a time stamp down in the description that lets people skip to where Ian joins you on Discord!
First time here. Congratulations. Awesome interview indeed. The fact the CEO of SMS chose to come on live and open up about a range of topics speaks volumes about you and your channel. I've hit subscribe and look forward to seeing the channel develop and grow. Thank you
Got a link to the entire thing? This link starts halfway through.
I love how the puddle stayed there for a freaking long time (Around 3:40:00). This was one of the  (minor)  gripes I had with PCars weather system, while it looked great, the transitions were little to fast, and the track changed from full wet to dry in 2-3 laps. I havent even consider buying this game outside of a sale, but now, after watching several streams and listening to this, down to the earth, honest, interview, I preordered. So yeah, Ian, you made a customer by jumping drunk and sleep deprived into a random stream :)
He gave away a few things he shouldn't have, he will be in trouble for some of the things he said for sure.
Ian Bell... Could you lie anymore?  Is such a thing even possible and at this point how can anyone besides the shills believe you?  You buy websites off to end negative coverage, surely you do it on YouTube as well.\n\nWould be very funny if EA sued you.  Oh God...the bells would ring, no pun intended.

I don't know why I continue to watch your videos, but.. why, do you need to push your hip out when you're standing ALL the time to try get a curve.. looks awful, and you snarl your face up to the side as well. Irritating AF!!
You wore that to the fashion district? Oh lord.. how many people harassed you?
yo my name is amber too
Any new YouTubers want to support each other? 💖💖\nI'll be posting giveaways, couple videos/pranks, ASMR, makeup and hair tutorial & hauls!\nCome SUB ME. I'll sub back 💞😊

I don't know why I'm so dressed up to go shopping *literally wears one of the most casual outfits she owns* hahaha I love you Amber
I swear I need that store in my bedroom
Dang, girl! <3 Always popping! I really thought your DIY is better than Kylie's! <3
You've inspired me to craft more, so I've been working on my Halloween costume for two/three weeks now. I see you and a lot of other people using E6000 glue and I seriously don't know how y'all do it! I bought some, started gluing down rhinestones and then I remembered a girl saying to read the directions first. So I flipped the bottle over and it said it's a cancer agent! It freaked me out so bad I immediately threw it away and anything it had touched. I'm a paranoid person I know, but how does that not freak you out???!!! I also tried to use glitter spray paint and afterwards saw that it causes cancer, kills your kidneys, harms your reproductive system and a ton of other scary stuff! HOW DO YOU CRAFT WHEN EVERYTHING USEFUL KILLS YOU?! 😂😂
I can't find any stores that sell crystals where I live. Do you have any advice?
The shirt was pretty but you made it even prettair
Amber you should wear red lipstick more often! It really compliments your beautiful tan skin color :)
Amber you should tan your hands as well it will look more even! 😘
Who else thinks Amber's re-creation was a thousand times better than Kylie's actual top ?!? :D
Could also have sewed on snaps so you can still wash the shirt without washing the decoration... :)
Her lashes bomb af on that end note 😭😭
Hi Amber I love all your videos ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yours look better than Kylie's 😘
How is it that I just discovered you and had 3 sleepless nights watching all your videos! You are authentic, beautiful inside out and I love love love your videos😘
Please wear the red lipstick more. U look so good it pops on u. Also I like ur shirt way better than kylies.lol
when a mannequin has more life than u..
I feel like in the thumbnail ambers looks better than kylies
Wanna go to the store!!! Omogosh!!!

HELLO BEAUTIFUL QUEEN
#welovebenjamin
Niceeeeeeee
How the fuck are you guys on trending XD
Holy shit the rumors are true I fired up a vpn based off in Great  Britain and its #37 on trending well done everyone and Murdoch Murdoch Team
For all the black people The south  Will take down it's confederate flags and Confederate statues  on one condition if you pull up your goddamn pants no one wants to see your crusty black asses
Does anyone else get incredibly motivated by what Murdoch says at 3:35?
I need to know the recording of The Star-Spangled Banner you used that followed after R/The_Donald's. Wow that was beautiful, I used to hate the national anthem as a child; presumably, because I only ever heard it sung by forlorn drugged out popstars, and not by united patriots.
holy hell Murdoch was that you singing?
Beware of the echo people they are another race white skin isn't a free win when your anti-white..
The symbolism behind these videos just effing brilliant.
Great ending with the jew soros getting impaled!
Absolute Waifu Pillow guaranteed to make you fail your gay little no fap, or your money back.
Has no one noticed they used the Merchant Minute bumper for their news segment???
I got my waifu pillow. The perfect birthday present. :D
Can somebody please tell me the version of the American anthem at the end of the video?
i dont know who writes these scripts for you or you write them all on your own but they are top notch! keep the good work!
The fact that all of us faggots are crying is the proof that there's still hope
damn right in the feels
Wew, lads. Shed a tear at the end. I'm not even American. Yeah, we're going to be needing more of this. A lot more.
hello I swa this on trending and and it is hateful please delete alhamdulillah
I feel bad. Somehow my shitty window movie video got more views then this video.
how dare present before our eyes a confederate flag, this must be one of those white people racist sites
Dude when I heard Copeland's Appalachian Spring, wow. Such a perfect choice.
The North wasn't for multiculturalism, Lincoln wanted to send the nigs back to Africa The jewish slave owners were in charge of the south. Not that I have anything against the southern soldiers, just the kikes that started the war.
Didn't show up on my feed, but did show up on my homepage.
Please do some kind of Easter egg of daddy Farage and an army of brits
Fantastic. Now I'm crying over a cartoon at work.\n\nBless you all.
This is beautiful. Is it gay if my eyes watered at the Anthem?
I want my America back :(
Nice one, really digging the minimalist approach you guys use. Kinda the opposite to my style, but it works!
This is making me so sad and im not even american.
This is probably the best anime I've seen in forever
Will we ever understand the weird and mystic ways of the Youtube trending algorithm??
>including that kike Woodrow Wilson in the ghosts of America
#37 on trending... inb4 jewtube hides it, removes the video, or just removes the entire channel for Hate Speech like they have with every other Alt Right channel
No 👏 More👏 Brother 👏 Wars 👏🤝✌
This was a great episode, you guys keep it up!
Can't believe that this is on trending right now
WAIT, HOW DID YOU GET ON TRENDING MURDOCH?
Was that the bulk and skull music used for the antifags?
I admire your optimism. Hit me hard in the feels.
Oh my God Murdoch Murdoch, absolutely incredible video.\nYou are absolutely correct, our race can't afford to fight each other. Our numbers our too few already.\n\nGod, I love this shit so much lol. Buying every item in the description. Get on Hatreon so I can throw more shekels at you!!\n\nPS: 29k views in 2 days? The fire rises!
Imagine if the South had won. We would have a nice barrier protecting us from Mexiscum (except for the far west).
All 2000 of you go to  Labour NZ and  National NZ to drop red pills during election
I cry every time.
holy shit!  Another amazing and relevant video. Complete with teary-eyed feelz
What recording of the star spangled banner is this? It sounds fantastic
It's an honor to die with you brothers.
this was great and that ending, so much feels
i wasn't ready for that wholesome ending i want my black pills back
great to see you guys are back
As if soulless antifa would ever have an epiphany and heil our people and cherish our history. The ending of this video is kinda cucked actually. RIP America. Over half our nation, and the large majority of the world, are mindless zombies. It is all over   :(  \n    Jesus, I know we do not deserve it, but you can return anytime now.
Uncensored full DVD (or USB which may be cheaper) release when? I'd buy one for $30-50
A beautiful message of unity. Never stop what you do. I will continue to buy your t-shirts.

#39 Trending in the UK Murdoch. Keep it up, pal!\n\nSome of us Brits want in on this unity. An Anglo gathering for us brothers!
I know this is going to be heresy to some people, but I'm a little disappointed with this vid def not their best imo. I'll be interested to see the next one and see if they get back to the regular program. I can see if they were trying gun to make a particular point with this video no more brother wars but it still felt a bit cucky.
why the hell did you include Neil Armstrong?! the guy was in on the scam - they never went to the moon!!
there is no difference between nazis and communists? \n\nnazis: kill all muslims and jews and  create the most advanced country on earth. invent V2 rocket and go to space. \n\ncommunists: support muslims because muslims make good communists. idiot muslims depend on their country to give them welfare so country can enslave the muslims. communists support muslims to take over western civilization.
Anyone know the performers who sang the national anthem at the end was? I really want to know
I understood about 1% of this. Also, why no native american ghosts.
No, no. This terrifyingly good for such an amateur group. In fact I am hard pressed to believe it. They must have professionals working with them. The writing is top notch, and they are genuinely fucking funny. In fact it reminds me of the humor of the 90s. This shit is incredibly dangerous to the left. I am the first person to point out bullshit when somebody tries to do edgy comedy. I fucking hate it. It is a travesty that the left lost their humor, as they used to hold a monopoly on it and were damn fuckng good at it. \n\nThis is incredibly dangerous to the left. They somehow made white identity sympathetic, funny, and you can relate to it. I do not know how they fucking did it. I am actually flabbergasted.
FUCKING TRENDING LADS

Big fucking open world map , a just 4 v 4 players in the map , great job Ubisoft.
I CAN'T WAIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOR STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT 2
such a big map and only a few maps to play, smh
Such a huge map and there's only 4v4 multiplayer. Pvp will be dead in just a few days
This is going to be amazing, I still play this game faithfully. I just hope we can customize class looks and weapons.
Why does the Artillery have a mine? 🤔
Everyone who is saying you should of made it battle royale style I agree but don't forget we're talking about Ubisoft a company heavily known for having some of the worst servers in all of gaming. You really think they can support the whole map with 50-150 people, hell no 🤣🤦‍♂️
This game died before the beta even ended 😕
Has Ubisoft confirmed that they will ONLY do a 4 v 4 PvP mode? Or is that just for the Beta???
this game has the potential to be the next socom. Throw in some objectives and open the map more and you've got yourself a competitive game that online gamers haven't seen in years. none of this casual, cs go/overwatch garbage
Ubishit
Lol\nBoring!
You gave me a reason to play this game again😃
need to have the game or its free beta
This looks like the most dummest and boring thing they can make and I like ghost recon
tinha que ter modo battle royle pq o mapa é enorme
Listen to the people Ubisoft. This is okay but for months we been begging for something more. Atleast make it 8v8 or 6v6
Don't care most players want new stuff for the co-op
Obviously not the PS4 version being shown, as it wasn't plagued by massive amounts of pop in.\n Seriously, this is the most pop in I've seen on any Ubisoft game. I don't expect perfection on a massive open world....but it has A LOT. Much more in comparison to any other open world game from even five years ago.
Yes!! Can't wait\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause I have no PSN account and I can't play it!!!
When will it actually come out after the BETA
Si on a acheté Ghost recon wildlands deluxe édition est-ce que on aura ghost war gratuitement?
Make it like pubg and ad like 32vs32 and i might pick it up
This game is dead
I deleted this game from computer after 10 hours and nothing will make me install it.
Hopefully there is a hardcore mode
You’ve got this huge map and are only doing 4v4? Lol this will be dead before it comes out.
This is the cheesiest trailer I've ever seen
Only thing I see is 3rd person advantage
4 v 4 pvp is not a good idea....stop doing this small team bullshit ubisoft ffs
coming out 9/24/2021 \nedit i’m excited tho
I love how all the people dropping the negativity will be the ones who play the new 4v4 the most. Haters are your biggest fans! thanks ubisoft
I'm actually happy there are no sniper rifles in this.  Seems like a lot of map for hiding on the edges all the time.  Time to shakes things up n see how everyone plays
Took long enough almost flicked the game
I'm not one that needs PvP but this looks kickass
Can't wait wish they had sniper class because what's what I play on the hardest mode and they never see me coming lmao
Who wants this when de have pubg
when pre download beta come in ps store thailand ps4 ver. dev , community tell me....
I like for this
Is that the doom(2017) music?
Despite what anyone says. It's a beautiful game high quality, all it needs is a battle royale mode to be on par with PubG. 💪
Love them or hate them this company is still one of the biggest AAA company out there... #UBISOFT
THIS WILL BE AMAZING!!!!!\nI CAN'T WAIT!!!
Could've brought people back with a battle Royale mode. It's already half made, they got the map, guns, and vehicles to make it happen. But they put their money on this?
I can't wait
So there are 6 classes now ? never played the game, should i get it ?
Can't wait for this I just got the game and really enjoying it
They are cheesing that voice actor
I love this game and R6S
Aaaaaand they fucked up GR. Rip. You will be missed.
Awesome! Going to be a cool mode for ghost recon wildlands I can't wait to see what it holds.!
Awesome
1:23 it's twitch
Basuda
Our thermal vision and night vision should come more in handy like in Bf4 the night maps were awesome because you actually had to try to find enemies i feel like that would be great in this games especially if you know what to put on your character to barely be spotted with night vision.
Make a battle royale mode like everyone else or a TDM mode with a big team scattered in squads, the game has a big map USE IT WELL FOR GOD SAKE!
I hope there is a sniper class
Will we get access to the R4, MDR, BFG 50, PSG1 or any other guns from dlc?
ill have to wait to play but i dont see this working like they plan to. whats to stop us from just sniping off the team while throwing down an airstrike. theres only 4 people i dont see matches lasting very long
Should have a battle royale mode
You gotta love that bfh theme music lol.
Can we please customize or Bot please man I hate their  uniform
wHy DoNt UBisOft MAke a BatTle RoYAle gAmE MOde in ThIs GAme tO rEVivE IT?🤷‍♂️
This looks fine, but I really wish you had stuck with a core four class system. Breaking it up into a dozen classes makes none of them feel particularly special. FWIW, I would be much more interested in a coop attack/defend mode than 4v4 PVP.
What a lot of people don't get is that the reason its this and not battle royale like we all wanted is because they'd have to pay for servers for that but with this instead its p2p so the host will be a player in the game and not a ubisoft dedicated server
Game is dead
Nicee
Would really like to see at least 10vs10 but I'll give it a shot
Age really
LOL
HELL YA
why just 4vs4 😢😢
The sniper at 1000 meters distance headshots lmg man
5 star
Finally
Metal gear solid anyone?
Me gustó mucho ese juegos de Goku rico se ve brutal
Boring!!!
More the Crew 2
jizzing my pants
The writing Hay fuerza Hay mente... doesn't make sense
Aaaaarrrgh! Start now!
This looks absolutely terrible
YES
disliked, idk why the hell y'all took so long
What! No sniper
Wildlands has its quirks but as an Hour to burn with a buddy COOP game it sure was worth my money. not every title released under the sun needs PVP. Hell, the last thing we need is a PVP saturated market. When this game was released I never expected it to have PVP, At most I expected COOP. the PVP here feels tacked on to please people, that's my biggest complaint at the moment.\n\nit may just my personal opinion, but damn, you want Battle Royale? play PUBG hell, Im sure its gun-play is better than Wildlands.
I want to play this so bad I have a 4 person group on ghost we're going to rek people
Ubi there's a website called r6credits.com giving out free credits please take it down as it could be a scam or the real deal
Can they just stop trying to make people buy or still play this game. Ubisoft just needs to admit that they fucked up
All you guys had to do was bring back Future Soldier's PvP, and just fix the hacking problem.
i hyped for this!
The fact that this is a DLC just shows Ubisoft and how incompetent they are. I just finished playin Wildlands. I have great intervener connection but I had lag in a solo campaign. Something is wrong with camera and player movement in Wildlands. I've never thought it would be possible to have lag in a solo game. Congrats Ubisoft you did it. Do not reply to this post, especially if your gonna say it's not possible. We're always on their server when playing.
Looks cool but by the time the real thing comes out shadow of war would be out.
Wait, is that dude at the end in a red shirt a new operator or someone revealed?
Cod is to Internet hungry have to have real fast speed or you are always behind , I can't get fast enough Internet so.i hope this is as bad
Have some played the beta? And is the gunplay better more fluid? In the base game it's complete trash :(
I'm haven't bought the game but this looks fun so imma try it
They're trying to pull of the no mans sky. Putting things in the game that were supposed to be in there in the first place. Putting all this effort in this and I'm sure it'll all be dead within a month. Everyone has already moved on or completed the game already. Ive already got all the achievements in this game and if this has no achievements in this there's 0 reason to go back to this game and play this....0
Lame. You could and should have made it much simpler. Give everyone three armor options, a list of guns to choose and let them see who's best. Now it's about who picked the best class talents. This is another typical, run of the mill shooter for children with ADD and no skill. Long live SOCOM!
So agile it's astounding!
that was painful to watch.\ndon't let him have children ffs.
What is this garbage? Where's Richard O'Brien?
I thought the part when he tripped over the stairs was hilarious too😂
I searched Crystal Maze furry and this was the first result. YouTube knew exactly what I wanted.
Joey Essex managed to do this.
What others think as Rob falls \nAw no\n\n\nWhat I think of when Rob falls \n\n\n\n\n*SHOOTING STARS* music
He's going round the rings ha ha lol
This is UK trying to leave the EU in Brexit
funny clip, but the revival of this show is an absolute joke.
Not exactly built for physical activities the tubby little virgins lol so funny and fell arse over head in the aztec zone just walking up a step lol gravity is a bitch!
I laughed when I first saw this and I'm laughing again now 😂
heavy panting on the first planet? this was never going to end well.....but comedy gold
Oh god please don't use interlaced video.
Me and the wife watched it and cried.
Doesn't help the fact that he's carrying the weight of three people
I pissed myself when he was on, didnt laugh justed pissed myself.
Omfg he is actually absolutely fucking useless piece of shite
an A+ athlete, a true inspiration.
Aw these are the loser squad the cosplayers
Hes a dragon right so why doesn't he just fly over?
This chubby fellow will forever be haunted by this experience. He shall pass the local chippie and go straight to the gym.
I knew this would trend when I watched it on tv. Poor lad, but it's just physics in action, his own weight moved the thing he was standing on out of reach of everything he tried to step towards. Not a good game for people who like a pie or three, I fear!
And that children is the reason why you exercise.
Why is he out of breath?
As soon as there was hint from the team that he should turn back, he was like - 'fuck this I'm heading back' 😂
Check the nick of that fat desperate cunt
Change speed to 1.5 and you may just cack your pants.
This is why aliens refuse to visit us.
Gotta go down as tv gold.couldnt stop laughing the other day when we watched it.
In a way I don't really expect much from someone who dresses up as a furry!! x'D And he was doing some weird pedo panting in there too on those planets.
One of the worst things I've ever watched! 😂😂😂😂 poor fella
Ground control to major Tom?
I was wacthing this last night and laughed so much I woke my family up
Some say this is lost NASA footage
That would've annoyed me being his team mate..I'm frustrated easily and his heavy breathing and failure at something so simple would've infuriated me..I'm a bad team player when it comes to having weak people in my team.
I know this man, he works in the same place as me. aww bless him.
Let us not forget that when they were running into the next zone, the same contestant you see here fell face-first into the ground.
the team were fun but...and i'm sorry if you reading this team..they were not the best physically built for the job...not very athletic for the physical challenges..the best Member being Martin IMO\n\nthey were there to have fun though i'll give them that and the beard dilemma was daft yet noticeable...if they ended with 5 seconds they could have been the new  team of..rubbish but loveable\n\nstarted strong and then...ohhhhhhh dear
I keep thinking this is nick crompton
I feel like he was this bad on purpose, to leave a legacy on the show he likes so much.
Fact: they really do lock them into the rooms on the crystal maze and since being shut into the planet room Rob has had to become a pole dancer and put his new found skills to good use in order to generate some income for himself.
This moment is going to be on best tv moments next year. This episode was hysterical
When did this show start again and Richard as the host brilliant.
That fat fuck s a retard... he doesn't know how to control his own damn body
This is what happens when you don't keep fit.
Wheres the mad bald gay bloke in the tiger jacket?
10 seconds in and it sounds like he ran a marathon. Wrong guy for the job
Don't make me shave your captain  ~ the human race 2017
I feel sorry for the guy because there is no way he's running away from this
Thank you Rob for the laugh, you really are a donut going round and round
It was even funnier when they only had 5 seconds in the dome, quality content from the team. :)
This is the pinnacle of British TV
Watched this live too. Funniest thing on TV in AGES!!
Should if got the bit when he fell up the step😂😂
What a waste of air
I was laughing like fuck when i saw this on Friday
Just watched it again, and it's still hilarious, just noticed his laboured breathing throughout the ordeal, the ludicrous advice from his team ( do the thing) and the girl snorting with laughter towards the end. Pure class. Afterwards he was trying surreptitiously to get his gloves off and couldn't even manage that !! Please put the whole thing up !!
My parents said it would go viral\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were right
That's what happens when *real panic* sets in - you end up going round in circles!!!\nLucky the game wasn't a 'timeless' one.  Rob would still be spinning...
I am REALLY Hoping this Episode & this Moment is Highlighted on This Week's Gogglebox...
Who on earth gave this fat fuck a Physical game?? And how the fuck did he pass the medical for this gameshow?? His breathing sounds like he needs a fuckin' ventilator because the fat is pushing in his lung capacity.
Right finally everyone I have persuaded Robert to get onto Twitter as hes becoming such a hit, follow or message him on Twitter: Planet_Spinner
Griffin brothers & Jen look like teenagers & children
Fucking lol
Oml!!! 😂😂😂
gg samwell tarly
Next time... On interdimensional cable 4!
HAHAHAHHAHAA!!!   Poor ol' Rob.   Funny as fuck tho'
SPAZ BOY!

Truly iconic
Richard Ayoade is funny.

Useless fatty 😂

LOL hahaha  2:20 bloody brilliant!
Well done Rob
Lmfao !ROBBBBB
what a clown
Spearmint Rhino has changed
Me during PE
Christ this was painful to watch. That guy was so shit he shouldn't have been let on the show.
Can he swing it towards the green one?. He's struggling with the orange one right next to him mate.
Genuinely haven't laughed so much at a tv program. Not only this jem but the fall in Aztec zone... amazing. Best episode of CM ever!
I refuse to believe that this is not a satire.
Well what do you expect from a cavalcade of fucking furries.
Why did they pick the fat guy 🤣
Did someone say autism.... On a side note, every single one of them wanks at least twice a week over that 'bird'.. FACT
When that other guy tripped on the fuckin stairs as well, priceless team
This team looked absolutely on fire to begin with, like they'd actually studied the show and were going to boss every single challenge, but it went downhill pretty quick. I mean they were entertaining enough, but not quite as clever as they thought they were unfortunately.
Cucktestant's are feeble :)
I seriously had a very difficult time uploading this. I don't like to put anything in my videos that might bring your mood down so please forgive me. I just need to start opening up a little more for you guys so you can understand some of the things that are taking away from the vlogs. Thank you so much for being here either way. I love you so much. See you Tomorrow. :)
❤️❤️
Smile more buddy!
Chicago City!!!! WOAHHHHH!!
Haters gona hate
This dude makes me hate hats....he's completely shattered that backwards snapback look.
I feel the way u think man
Is this going to be your movie
Roman you have made me laugh and got me through tough time and I'm sure you did with thousands of other people. It's time for you to just relax and don't worry. Smile more
Worry not my friend. We all love you guys. It's good to have a vent vid every now and again, shows that no ones lives are perfect and everyone has their own stresses and challenges. What matters in the end is that you get through it and what you make of it.
I don't understand why everyone is hating on Roman. Give him a break. Alot of stress can really mess with you. Yeah people have bigger problems but it's hard. He doesn't want millions of people mad at him for not uploading like usual. Cut it out. I hope Roman understands that his real fans don't care about how long the vlogs are. I know I don't. Stay strong Roman ❤️❤️
❤❤❤
Twat
White trash
i  love  Chicago   xoxooxoxox

Stop manipulating your audience.
Unsubbed!
Mong
Roman, if it makes you feel any better I think that if you don`t have traveling on your channel then it would always be the same. It`s nice to mix things up a bit and have different content. I know it might be difficult to leave your family but you gotta do what you gotta do. :) p.s if you are reading this (I doubt it) I love you so much and you are a huge inspiration to me!
Roman u r the best Youtuber u keep doing what your doing keep up the good work
i feel you
I feel so sorry for you multi millionaire Roman Atwood while i sit in my one bedroom house with no heating.............

You're the best youtuber ever and it is ok to share your problems.

Weee loveeee youuuu
roman it's ok we are your family ok roman just smile and a have good life ok smile more
Im in the UK I wanna snuggle your mate on the rocking horse Roman ;)
I've been watching literally EVERY SINGLE SECOND OF EVERY VLOG since before Roman had 1 mil subs
You know what Roman? You need some time off, no needed to be sorry, if anyone expects you to record every aspect of you and your families lives, they need a serious reality check, take as much time as you need man, you can only do so much, you and your family are leaving behind a lot of memories for YouTube to share, so even you stopped youtubing, I believe this channel still would grow, only the real peeps would stick around even if you quit, all I can say is, you and your family keep your heads up and smile more, many blessings sent my friend.
We understand.. PLEASE PLEASE PLEEAASSSEE do not apologize for being a human being and having real life problems ❤️
Roman I will always support you no matter what
Stop stressing ur going to be ok stop handing over projects to the man
We are here for you man
I live inChicago
Awesome Vid + Sad Vid
*OMFG* Sorry did not mean that -F- ;)
No matter what, you are amazing and your true Roman soldiers are always here to support you.
Do what’s best for you, Roman. Focus on YOUR project and worry about the channel later
Every human has problems Roman... So if you kept trying to hide them, we would think you weren't human.. Just kidding all jokes aside, just do what you love. Put your family and yourself first over life and you will find happiness more!
What's happening to Roman's views?
Share everything. If this is really a daily vlog for you then share the good and the bad. That is what I do on my vlog. If ppl love you yhey have to love the whole package and having tough days goes with it. So please don't appologize for being who you are. WORK HARD DREAM BIG Roman. Greetings fron the Huber's Ranch in Switzerland
We are all human. Negative things happen to us all. We can't avoid them. Glad you opened up and shared this with us. Full support!
Sending Prayers for you, love you & your family!!! You can get through this, SMILE MORE. 💙💜💚❤️💛
You will be in my prayers! Also, I caught that pee corner Office reference! That makes me like you thaaaat much more! Keep your chin up!
We will always support you
I'm always going to be here on this channel no matter what Roman.
Wow people are super mean! I've been watching you with my kid I thank you for putting good videos online and not crap! Do you take time off and don't worry about people who hate, they just have nothing better to do the judge others online. Don't watch if you don't like it! I thank you for what you do and you and your family are beautiful!
Stop being a pussy. You're living my dream life roman... count your blessings.
No need to apologize we understand.. we still love yall:)

I heard he’s deleting his channel at the end of 2017 roman is this true?
We are here for you Roman
You are such an amazing person and your family is so precious in good times and not so good days we are here for you👍
It is ok we are all here for you we love you and your family
we all love you Roman x
Thank you for your videos your cool dude... Keep them coming
It's okay roman we understand where your coming from
What is wrong with all of you people in the comments!! Holy crap! Give the guy a break! You and your family are so inspiring roman, keep it up and ignore all these freaking immature kids!
Roman the main reason why your views are dropping is because school has started and we don't have the time that we did in the summer trust me you are doing a great job multitasking with the big project
Roman is my hero
It's ok Roman. I haven't notice anything bad until you said this. A lot of youtubers skip days all of the time and make little 5 minute videos, but wow, you post almost every day and make long 17-18, more or less, minute videos and it's crazy! Don't feel bad! Real Roman soldiers and great people will understand. It's not that big of a deal! You are awesome Roman! Thanks
Like you say Roman, it can always be worse.
It's ironic how his motto is Smile More with all the positivity yet he's always the one complaining about something... man up and keep moving forward
Please you tube don't send me this stuff or anything from trending.so family life is trendy now?wtf.
I think I speak for most of your viewers when I say. You are human Roman! We will be here! Take care of yourself bro.
A slight increase in pressure and you are stressed, tired and whining to us. Do your job. Get dancing monkey!
Hey Roman - all of us are sending you big hugs and sharing our strength with you.  Stay positive and smile
You and your family Change my life everyday im glad you did this vlog your REAL life its awesome you share
Roman if you need to take a break from the vlogs so you won’t be so stressed and so you can sleep then go ahead. I’m not just a fan, I’m a caring fan and I love you. There will not be anything that you post that I don’t watch. You’re amazing!
Oh my god, why are so many people being dicks for no reason, if you don't like his work, don't watch him, it's that simple.
Love your vlogs and do what you have to do. Smile more 😝😜😛
I love you roman and your doing an amazing job keep it up !! 🙌🏽💯
I watch every video to the end
We still love you!! its life and you do what you have to do!  Love you all
It makes me sad to know ppl get upset that you leave you family. You're doing big things and ppl definitely need to remember that. Me and my boys watch your videos almost every school night just before bed. They look up to you and rightfully so. I admire your dedication to your family and respect your Drive. You need to do what you are happy with. If it's your project put whatever the fluff you want in it lol. As for the vlogs we would all miss you if you took a break but if that'll help just know your supporters will be here whenever you'd return. Your doing wonderful things for so many ppl so just remember that. Your human and sometimes you just have to step back and asses things, figure things out. Chat with Brit & the boys about how to make it better and easier on all of you. At the end of the day you'll always have fans that support you and your family is always there. So just take a minute to think about what's the best option right now and go from there. Sending lots of love from our family straight to yours. Xoxo \nCheers

Best rapper in the entire site kingdom DIY queen
2 words for this AMAZING music video:  Damn Gurl 
Lauren ! \nThis isnt the real you!\nBtw love the song
He beat him like he stole something.
TAP TAP TAP
Rock hold is the best middle weight ever
At least cm punk didn't tap out due to strikes \nBranch cannot be called a black belt!!!!
1 minute with a guy like cockhold at your back. brain damage or tap?
andersons not on my level, he never was LOL
get back on track Luke
All shoulders
Imma beat you like you stole something.
Actually,I'm glad cuz he talked even more trash then Rockhold! And he's the one that said I'ma beat you like you stole something.' He ate those words.
This was a horrible match-up. No way did Branch belong in there with a guy ranked as highly as Rockhold. Period. We're getting a second helping of this farce when OSP does the same thing to Okami.
that was a nasty body triangle
Branch was piecing Rockhold with strikes, he just didn't have KO power.
essa cara não tem fôlego pra 5luta
Insecure black men on suicide watch! XD
...Tapped to strikes tho??
go get bisping
Ground n pound from the wesssssssstside
David Ill keep this fight on the feet if I want Branch
Can't wait until he gets revenge against Bisping.
he will never be champ again.
Tapping out to strikes... Bob Sapp looks like he lost a lot of weight...
Great fight, but please stop telling me that Branch has earned a black belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu under Renzo Gracie. Please stop! Maybe Ebay, Etsy, Target...I don't know. Surely he hasn't 'earned' one.
IMO It's between him and Anderson Silva over who's the best MiddleWeight. That'd be a good fight too btw.
Luke outcold
Nothing wrong with tapping from strikes against Rockhold. Branch was probably thinking about what happened to Weidman when he got pounded on for a minute straight.
This was a boring fight ... Anything else???
He does not have a heart to stay in the ufc
Really hope all these comments aren't serious. Luke needs to beat Bisping and also give Weidman his rematch. Robert is also next in line, there's a lot for Luke to do to be called Best MW.
All the trash talking and now this? Tap from an arm bar or maybe a choke..but this? Lots of other champions got beat up a lot worst, a lot worst and didn't tap
Kinda disappointing to see him tap to strikes, I thought this was the guy to at least to fight go until the end to try to make a statement. Also feel like Luke's hairline is still much better than it might seem, I'm sure it would just look a lot better if he grew his hair a little.
Cormier needs to go ahead & retire so we can see what Luke can do at 205 since the weight cut is killing him now.
Rock hold won, but still had an awful performance.
Rockhold looked a little sluggish to me when the fight started but i guess he had no choice since branch was chasing him down like a hungry dog. I thought branch had him when he let off that flurry of punches in round one but rockhold ate the shots and stayed in the game. Can't believe branch tapped from strikes. Never thought that'd happen. I had rockhold knocking this dude out
I want Uriah hall to destroy Luke that's a fight that I wanna see
I ate unicorn meat. - Jon No Steroids Jones
this was a gimme for luke
Wow Rockhold! What happened to your hair??...
Since the cornermen wouldn't throw in the towel.
Khabib and what he taught you!
David on Wednesday- imma do dis kid dirty\n\nDavid on Saturday- ........
way too similar to the recent weidman comeback. fixed like boxing.
wth???? ive never seen a guy tap out like that. intresting
Rockhold slowly going bald ,   how's he going handle that ,   i mean ARCHER is going bald
Better hope the ref doesn't stop it\n*30 seconds later*\nBranch: tap tap tap\n\nClearly he WAS hoping the ref would stop it
JESUS is  real!!!!!! Did u know that? Look it up... The time is now
Geez, what do u even call that? Tko by tapout?
The move of the fight was, let me gently lay you down right here.
Boring commentary
Rockhold cruzou as pernas, foi um erro mas que passou despercebido pelo oponente
GG
Bisbing would have ko rockhold again
Sporchmensip HAHAHAH
Branch pulled a GSP
always bet on black lol
Lol, this is more humiliating than getting KO'd stiff.
He was finished, exhausted, no point in taking damage to look tough only then to get a busted ear drum or broken bones
What really is disappointing is branch was pretty vocal about this fight and it went this way. It makes branch look totally foolish now especially since he tapped to strikes. But branch lit up luke with a combo that landed clean and luke took it like a champ so either his chin aint so bad or bisping hits harder than we thought
Rockhold is really good looking, perfect physicque  tbh. Ripped and aesthetic but also with functional muscle that works in fights
Gonna go back to Brooklyn like a bitcheckc
When Rockhold gets top control it means big trouble. The athleticism keeps him there.
Figures. First card I miss in a while, because of Canelo vs. GGG and the card turns out to be stacked with a bunch of KOs and Subs instead of decisions.
He tapped out with strikes wow talk to all that s***
You see how he checked out his work as he walks away. this is hilarious.
Good job rock you beat him like he stole something lol
needs more volume, thanks.
What a beast!
Even Weidman didn't tap from strikes
Steroids
brownsville style tap
Cruz.  Great sportsman sip 
Ref shoulda stopped this
Luke I'm going bald Rockhold
To much to handle
Bisping stared him down too lol
Ref didnt save him he tapped brah
Shogun rua \nTap too !
Anybody notice Rockhold's new stance?
ima bet you like you stole something
this guy needs to fight yoel ramero
Bj Penn
Luke The Dbbag Cockhold!
Luke cuckhold is losing his hair yikes
Branch is a goon
David branch is one of those lying cousins...he lied to his aunt to this day about getting her UFC tickets ....hes just a scumbag who says he's going to be something when everyone knows he's not ...
im gonna break u son
Luke roidshold
Artem Lobov is the GOAT
white genetics
Branch told rockhold in the weigh in his gonna break him. Demented mofcker lol!!
Listen mothafucka!!!
Luke Rockhold wrestling looked like Khabib style !
After watching Mayweather/GGG/Canelo, mma striking looks so rudimentary
Luke luta veia da pouxa
Luke has a lot of potential but needs a better camp.
So does this count as a submission win for rockhold?
God I hate that cocky, arrogant fuckhead.  Hope he goes against romero or another 185 killer and gets ktfo again
Rockhold has the best body among MMA athletes
Tapping from strikes, you just don't do it at this level, ever.... Forever know as the Branch (tapping from strikes) don't pull a Branch, ever lol
Either Rockhold is back or Branch is one lousy fighter.
Who would you cast as adult versions of the Losers' Club in the inevitable It sequel? We're going to have to go with Amy Adams as Beverly.
40 on trending
bill does have red hair well in certain lights it comes through so probably more of an auburn
Wyatt and Chosen are taller than Jaeden
Bill skarsgard is hot
Did this guy just say nemesises...?
Make one for The Dark Tower. ;)
New-cumber. This guy...
You'll float too
Me: Nicholas Hamilton! Cool name...\n\nMe: Wait- ALEXANDER HAMILTON
Bill (It) did perfect! The smile is perfectly nerve-racking. I just saw the movie and was terrified. I'm still fucking shaking, I haven't been scared of a horror movie since Silent Hill. Of course most horror movies have good plots, but are never perceived well and are less fearsome.
In the book Pennywise has an electric blue tie. How could you mess that up?
I was hoping for the half eaten bodies wrapped up in spider web more than anything else in this movie...ah well. Too much CGI for the scary parts, but the cast was fantastic.
this video rocks!! love all this IT stuff. I finished the book just two weeks ago and I can't let go, I'm obsessed!
I much prefer that Pennywise look like an actual circus performer  clown instead of a birthday hobo clown.
Masters of Sex?
The new movie is pretty good,...still love the original best tho
I would like to see IT face of against a kid with actual psychopathy. A child with no empathic functions or the ability to sense fear (as we know it). \n\nWould IT just kill him and be done with it or try to use him? Perhaps IT would see it as interesting as well.
The casting was perfect
In my opinion these kids nailed this movie🙌🏾
. \n\n\n\n\n\nIt's in my second fanny pack
The clown was too good looking because it's Bill
lol I go to school with jack grazer
I cant wait till this movie comes out on dvd, gonna poop my pants when it comes out
I saw the movie and the fact that it was way scarier then 1990...remember pennywise only comes out every 27 years,and the first time it was 1990,27 years later was 2017 lets wait 27 years for the next it...
Who else just skipped to pennywise?
I want nothing to do with King or anything he is involved in.
I hate this clown appearance I would like to see the orginal makeup
I hate colons
fuck that, i'd rather watch the original.
I LOVED the new IT movie!!
This is not the type of clown you would like to see at the carnival anytime soon. I died laughing at that, intentional or not it was funny. (In the book, at the carnival some bullies get angry at a gay couple, which leads to them throwing one of them over the bridge, in which IT takes him and drags him under.)
Tozier not Tojer.
they did good but the guy with the stutter is way taller than the rest of them and it looked like he was two-three years older than them.
R
🎈🎈🎈🎈\n   🎈🎈🎈\n      🎈🎈\n          🎈\n           🤡
Stan Uris was totally worthless in the movie
*OOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG, can't people every be happy with what they got/get?*
Of the Loser's Club members, you listed the Black kid and the Jewish kid last...was that intentional or merely unconscious?
I think they all look ok
The cast looks just fine to me. I loved the adaptation and so did Stephen King. So changing or wishing changes is pointless.
The movie was a pile of shite
I was expecting for drawings
Patrick looks like Rodrick
i love clowns, I love grapes
Dane Dehaan as older Bill
This I by far my favorite movie if you haven't seen it yet go watch it NOW!!!!!🤡
Next video idea: *How IT should really be spelt*
Know
Title has me like Caste of what exactly'?
Why would a good looking girl be apart of a group called the loser club
Jack Douglass\nShould be Pennywise
a GAY clown would feed itself quite well in every smaller US TOWN I guess
Skårsgard needed hella lot more lines
*Beverly was THICC*
A bully in marvels ant man ?
The pinned comment at the top is proof of the validity of this video and this channel....that would be none.
No
Looper stop click baiting, for fuck's sake.
Already watched twice at the 🎥 anyone else watch more than once
I Like The Bill Skarsgard Pennywise The Best Also There's Awesome Music While There's A Horror Movie Going On
Buyer hunter violence kcmsmm need crop office musical.
Did you guys remember the train scene man that was good shit....
Who's seen this ???
it's book accurate...stop comparing it to the mini series.
dc by Eagles played out late now\n\nPlay
Can I just say\n\nGOD I LOVE THE ENTIRE CAST SO MUCH
It was a really really good movie
THE MANSION IS FROM AMERICAN HORROR STORY😮😮😮
GUYS PLEASE SUB TO ME IF I HIT 1000 SUBS MY FRIEND WILL GIVE ME 100 DOLLARS CASH PLEASEEE
me encanto
I was disappointed . They did not carry over the spirit of the book
Pennywise teeth remind you of the teeth from the things in dreamcatchers
fans of IT won't soon forget her name.\n\nYou're making the assumption that I remember any actor's name. There are very few I can think of off the top of my head. Maybe a half dozen, and that's from memes. Don't have much memory for people of little importance.
The characters just have new ITerations
I see Chris Pratt playing Ben
red bull clownathon@
Why is Pennywise's nose so huge in the thumbnail?
Nfk
The only thing is... the creature IT, uses the form of Pennywise to better catch his prey, children. He's supposed to be a family friendly looking clown, kind of like Tim Curry's portrayal of him, but Skarsgard's portrayal seems alot more like he would frighten kids away :L
Am I the only one that wants no name actors for the adult versions of the characters? The movie star presence would really take me out of the movie
fin made that movie
Pleas I wish to get 1000 subscribe pleas help me \nPleas
Scuffed j's
Who else wished IT wasn't in chapters?
This movie was ass
Personally, I thought that Tim Curry's Pennywise was scarier because it was more realistic, and that's scarier (to me, at least). I wasn't scared of this one since it was obviously CGI'd.
still ship the new kid and bev
Wow I literally got an It ad 😂😂😂😂
Lol is it just me or does mike hanlin look like mohamed ali
Watch IT again look at the front of bills hair its red its a firey red in his fringe!
This is quite possibly the most unnecessary video ever made.
Stan Uris in the book does not have a sense of shaken faith. It is the opposite. His faith combined with parenting of his parents prevents him from fully accepting that something absurd and crazy like a powerful creature Pennywise exists at all. The book says that his faith and culture always pull him to worldview that everything makes sense, has cause and effect, and some kind of order.
Amazing acting.
I saw the movie today... and i cant sleep from watching it... so i go to youtube and scroll through trending...my heart skipped a beat.
YOU KNOW WHAT THESE ARE MOM!? THEY'RE GAZEBOS!!!!
Sophia is somehow 5'0, she looked taller but ig that's editing for you
I get the point of the vid, but the acting is 100x more important than how they look.
I'm gau
Y un comentario en español :v
someone should do a compilation of Louis saying Aiight i got a cheeky little coffee :D
he needs to stop saying little plane
The Scotland castle actually made me cry, what a beautiful place!
Yay another pleb visiting the UK lol. Ah at least they aren't helping fund a dictatorship on this visit lol.
Louis! What's the type/model of this plane? You've said before but I can't find it now.
Gosh, this is amazing!
So dope...lovin' these vlogs fam
7th on trending bro 😮
Nice video man
Was waiting to see the people from a couple days after Matt joined were like he's a jerk, now they're like Matt's such a good addition smh hypocrites
That freaking castle!
i enjoyed this
13:02. Just beautiful💚💚💚
Hi I have best deal for people who loves to travel around the world at the same time to earn some money with it. Email me at parth_upadhyaya@yahoo.com to know further.
I live in Scotland and Wick is my grandparents local airport (they can only really get to Edinburgh from there)
great to see you loving Scotland/Caithness!
Am I the only one who thinks after the world tour he should visit every state in the plane, or every European country or Asian country
We all float down here.
Wee get ittt - you have a better planee
6:19 Guy on the right looks like scout from tf2
Love the beats in this episode!
I'll take some cashews. I like cashews. and then you wip out a banana.  :-)
Sightseeing is just a BIT better in a 210 (high wing, no struts) than a Bonanza, Matt!  (But Bonanzas do fly better :) lol)
Everything about this video is top notch, Great Job!
OMG THE TREE HOUSE SUPER COOL! =)
You should have landed on the Faroe Islands - so picturesque there
Simply put this series is legendary.
Thanks for promoting our beautiful country. You are welcome home anytime.
Nice to see the guys smiling in unison! \nGood vibes!\nShout out to the pilot/s ♡☆♡
Why did you leave Scotland in the first? *draws Tesco discount shank from north face puffer jacket*
Just wondering when is Louis' coffee not cheeky and little ahahah ;P
freaking out that my little home country is in your video Louis! you should come and visit the Faroe Islands. It's a very special place with unique nature :)
The music remind me of samurai champloo lol
I ONLY FOUND OUT IT IS IN 4K NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please do a tour of Scotland and come to Fife 😍 I didn't realise you were half Scottish. We love you 😁
Yoooo most my dads family lives in wick and Thurso I knew I recognised that castle 😄
Louis...you don't come to Scotland enough
Haha, here on my up next video queue there's a video from CBS about Matt's flying around the world.
Pretty cool to see that castle and can't wait to see the abandoned one!
Experience is by far better then 2D sofa riding
OMG!!!  That Castle!!!!   Amazing!!!!  Love these videos!!!!
this is so inspirational - i would love to travel the world some day❤️❤️
Awesome video. Seems like the drone camera is a bit wonky though, horizon is off in all of the clips
Welcome to Caithness. My home county😊😊😊👌👌
Great Vlog bro. Loved that castle.  Don't stress yourself over getting the vlogs online all the time. We're all human and travelling round the world can't be easy - make sure you sleep and get enough rest. We can wait - your health is more important Sir.
I just came across your vlog by accident and you landed in my home town! So cool! A little bit homesick now though 😂 your whole trip looks so awesome, gonna have to go back and watch the rest 😀
why did the route change from islamabad to mumbai?
On my word!!! I agree with Louis that tree house is is awesome! I have never seen anything like that with the trees coming out of the roof. It definitely looks like something out of Lord of the Rings or something. Someday I want to go to Scotland too because I am Scottish as well.
What plane are you flying
Love it! I just started my own vlog, I'd love for you to check it out. Keep up the amazing work!
what are the fuel prices for planes like this ?
Woop woop! My home town of Wick!
Love you bro! I want to show you around Sydney Australia !!! Even better, fly into a small coastal airport in NSW called Albion Park and leave the rest to me!! Peace out BOOM!
Have JP review theses video's. You guys are in baller heaven.... or is still on a bicycle in Idaho. https://m.youtube.com/user/streetattractionuk
I got excited as the arrow in the thumbnail pointed to where I live and I was like WoAh you live in Caithness\n\nAnd then he said england.\n\nLies\n\nOnly lies
both planes are awesome in their own ways but if you were in his Bonanza JP and he would be rubbing shoulders anda cpl hundred pounds of useful load would be left home for maybe 3 to 5 knots advantage\n\na Bonanza is lighter on the controls but having owned both types i'll take a Centurion any day in weather and IMC conditions..much more stable
Scotland reminded me of game of thrones scenes
Louis has such a peaceful attitude. Even when they dog on his plane and say little side comments about changing GoPro batteries. If this is the personality of pilots no thanks.
If would love to do this. But you need lots of money to do it.
This made scotland seem like the north pole
I love this world series, so inspiring, I even started my own channel after seeing this, but I made it my own. I do vlogs about events in London, and all that.
I am really enjoying the videos. & the three of you are getting on so well and todays video. WOW that drone filming of the castle in Scotland. Right on the edge of the sea.& all the farmland and livestock. Amazing
Someone should make a video of all of the times Louis said just grabbed a cheeky little coffee
I live in wick.
https://youtu.be/Eupd8Nu1h3o pretty cool from cbs interview with Matt when he flew around the world.
Wow amazing inspiring video. Keep sharing. Love and support!
Yay Louiiiiis!!!! Damn you guys are working hard in this trip, stay healthy!
Brilliant I heard you were in wick, shame I never bumped into you😢❤
I want to know whether or not the coffee I'm drinking is a cheeky little coffee or not. I don't know how to tell the difference.
Fun fact, Matt ended his around the world trip at High Performance Aircraft at Gillespie Field in El Cajon (San Diego), California. I work one hangar away from that and watched him during his press interview when he landed.
Great music for that epic drone shot!
Oh hey it's the North Korea dude
wow this is very delayed. Alfie made his vid when you arrived 2 weeks ago. You must be in spain or something idk! xd loving the vlogs
Im from dublin!
2 weeks ago
Come to Inverness
CHEEKY LITTLE COFFEE COUNT: 10234091230491234123412346725367682352231
What part of Scotland is his mum from??
Funforlouis where abouts on Scotland are your mum side from??
will there ever be a place where louis can get just a cup of coffee? wherever he goes the little cheeky one seems to follow
This is by far my favourite set of vlogs on this channel so far. Pure authentic adventurous content. Keep up this kind of stuff up, don't work yourself too hard and thank you infecting the world with positivity
Great stuff, love that castle!
Their staying at the Norseman hotel because I go there a lot it is kinda expensive but not to expensive it's called the Norseman Hotel in wick
Is he going to Scotland??
Like if you're from Scotland
Yo i love your vids. Avid follower. Im from London but living in jakarta for a couple of years. Any plans to stop over in indonesia?
loving these vlogs so much! Dont worry that theyre not up to date!! It is not a problem :) :)
why didn't you interview @DaveErasmus for your upcoming Aftermovie ? 🤔
Food for louie
No mention of the poor guy who fed you coffee and snacks through the nights, thats gratitude for you ;)
People. List all his sources of income
Omg I remember watching Louis' vlogs a long time ago like years and got reminded of his channel just now and couldn't remember his name so I searched vlogger with incredible dreadlocks and Vlogger who hurt himself on a skateboard cuz I remembered that video where he fell and hurt himself bad I'm so happy that I found his channel again and I will make sure to subscribe :D
Omg my ex is in this video at 12:45 what a coincidence
Those suits are cool and so smart your being safe.
Can we all acknowledge how extremely unfit Louis is. Like he is out of for 85% of this video and thats from walking from the plane to the car. Kind of worrying.
hello all, come and check us out
Can everyone subscribed to me please I do gaming videos
Louis spends half the flights asleep, what's the point of flying round the world if you just sleep through it!!
I'm FROM SCOTLAND 😁
Three white males, this triggers me so much. And the way Louis says guys rather than gender neutral people.
As usual HOTS skins are better than the actual OW skins
I need dva the destroyer
Im not sure if this dva skin is more Diablo or more Starcraft like.
You should add these to overwatch
Instead of pumping out alt avatars that only differ in color wouldn't it be easier to let the players pick the colors and styles of the hero they play?
Now lets see Fel-Tainted Ragnaros (green) and Cold-fire Ragnaros (Blue). Maybe even a tech-inspired skin for him as well. :)
y are the shrike recolors better than the normal one???
they should change the name to Money grab of the storm.
oh yeah, more legendary duplicates! Can't wait.
those recolors are going to pollute the lootbox pool again....
They missed the chance to call D.Va the Destroyer as D.VaBlo.
cool. :)
where is junkrat? :(
Is that widowmaker at 0:55 ?
D.va the Destroyer is my new waifu.
Can this dva skin PLEASE be added to overwatch, I'd pay for SO MANY LOOTBOXES!
1:36 Deathwing spray.  Because of D.va skin or teasing new hero?
Those pachimaris need to make their way back to OW.
I want purple rib bit Lucio c:
I wish Overwatch had as many skins as HOTS. Variety is fun.
well, rip deathwing as a hero but thats fine.\nits nice that they are releasing so much content and the blizzcon is 1 month away.
FINALLY a new Varian skin.
Blizzard is killing it. Riot went stagnant after taking a crack at Blizzard's mod game, DotA. Blizzard packs a ton of content in less than half the time Riot snuck in to get paid.
now that's 1 hot dva skin
Finally an Overwatch character that isn't hyper mobile
i am dissapointed the D.va of all people got the deathwing skin... but that might just be because i REALLY hate D.va from both lore and gameplay standpoint.
stop making all the best skins for a game no one wants to play
Please can you look to make some skins for otherwise over looked heroes like Guldan and Nazeebo.
you can smell the destiny 2 marketing from a mile away.
so they are not going to add the beautiful captain amari skin...
PLEASE BLIZZARD WE NEED THE OW SKINS ON OW! MAKE IT HAPPEN
Would be nice with young Ana skin.
So Blizzard, you 're straped for cash? Sure fair enough, here's some of our money.
The Pachimari sprays and Player Icons are the best things in this upcoming patch. Nothing can beat Pachimari.
Sick now we need the Innkeeper!
Meanwhile I still cant bring myself to play this game anymore cause its been broken for 2 years now. Game runs flawlessly even on extreme settings but freezes for 2-3secs every minute making it totally unplayable and unenjoyable. Ive tried every fixes I found on the internet but in the end its Blizzturd who wont fix the mess they created. I used to play HOTS every day back in beta/early launch up until Skeleton king/Johanna release where an update broke the game and has turned it into a unplayable mess.
I just want a female Draenei as a playable character. :o
Nice, Arthas´s Invincible is finaly in the hots!
Well well, this fancy new D.Va skin has been obviously designed by Mei.
Still no greymane love, what a surprise
Would be so cool if we can have D.va Destroyer Skin for Overwatch aswell!
Aw, I was hoping for Junkrat to be released first.
D.Va is becoming the new Nova and Li Ming by receiving new skins and recolours every patch! xD
I need that Red Varian skin.
Where are the GENJI SKINS AT!!?!?!?!?
Varian looks like he is about to rush B...
Looks cool I hope for Junkrad next but Ana is a good choice. And a roadhog skin for Stitches please :)
they need to add monster truck from rpm racing and it will be able to run oveer terrain and kill people
Can't wait for Ana, but rip Deathwing our lord and savior... D.va's skin is very nice though!
With and the Volskaya map I was hoping to see a Soldier 76 skin for Raynor. Sigh, sooner or later ...
Finally see some Cassia love and it's just a simple re colour. GIVE ME SOMETHING TO WORK WITH!!
Make the Captain Amari skin WITH a younger voice of Ana. That will sell crazy!
Still waiting for the Apects, Blizzard! (Especially my bae, Alexstrasza)
Except for Ana itself and D.Va Destroyer skin, nothing special. Also those cutie sprays are interesting. But no more.
Maybe add a surrender and I might come back.
They should change the sound when D.VA jump!!! for a new skin!
The zerg skins are the best...Butcherlisk, and now anubalisk! They should bring out a zerg dehaka......
great skins but i still kinda wish taht the other heroes got some new ones *cough* greymane *cough*
The artists and designers of the Heroes of the Storm team responsible for making those skins (and color palettes) are WAY better than the guys working on the Overwatch skins. Why can't we get those skins, or similar ones like that for the Overwatch heroes in the actual Overwatch game?
blizzard i want the rock 'n' roll racing larry announcer! would pay top dollar for it! ;-) pls do it!
that skin on 0:16 would fit destiny perfectly *call you in Guardian*
way too much overwatch stuff, dva has more skins then heroes that have been in since the beginning. wtf.
I still think tracers master skin looks like a todler's air plain/space shuttle costume.
what about new skins for Greymane
Kommadant Varian looks amazing
Wish list:  Imperius, Selendis, Anasterian.
Hey you guys got your Deathwing! Congrats Deathwing  fans!
1:55 starraptor?
Fel D.V.A!!
no captain amari skin, yikes
DEATHWING DVA LOL!!!!
i hoped junkrat first damm
come to brazil
RUSH B (c) Varian
0:57 if urgot got the dunkmaster darius skin\n\n\n\nwrong game
Killer music
Pedobear Varian
Pachi Pachi Pachi!
OW CANCER
min 1:36   Deathwing confirmed
1.Abathur skins plx !!!!!!
STILL WAITING ON ALARAK ANNOUNCER
still no greymane skins...sigh
Hots rules
Deathwing D.Va pretty sick though
hope deathwinf d.va has matching sounds
poor lunara got missed again
op op !!music name?
If Commandant Varian doesn't yell ''ANUUUU'' and/or ''CHEEKI BREEKI'' during parry then I'm uninstalling this game.
hahahaha Finally Ana Can Hit Genji to heal
音乐真难听
Dommage que Varian est deux bouts de plastique au lieu des éclaires du trailer.
Invisible horse...hollow man...HOLLOW HORSE.
That D.Va skin is hot fiyah
Wait Lucio is in Hots?
Prophet Velen! ;(
skins are very destiny-ish..subliminal advertising?
Awesome more recolors to dilute the reward pool!
D.VA IS HOT!\n... Literally
More Valeera skins yet GM hasn't gotten a new skins since the Iphone 6..
Cristine is the closest thing we have to parental supervision on Youtube.
Cristine, is there a way to create the magnetic polish effect with regular nail polish. I kinda feel like magnetic polish is cool looking but it's like a cheap trick, while what you do takes skill and creativity.
New video idea:react to simply nail logical ruined my life 👌🏼
*i almost didn't make it to the gym! So hypnotized by the Holo Porn*
Hey can I ask you something? I want to start my own YouTube channel and want to have soya nail polish in my first video. But they do not ship to the Netherlands. Can I send it to you? So that you send it to me?
I bite my nails and paint them maybe 10 times a year. BUT I just really enjoy watching all of Cristines videos!
This is soooooooooooooo beautiful, too beautiful, it not deserves me 😩
Christine, your voice is the audio version of happy rainbows and sunshine!
You almost lost me with the opening; thought it was a Taylor Swift video and I’d died and went to hell, somehow.
-It's drugs !-\nNice vid !
Check this stuff out...it's the sh**t!!!! https://www.glitternailartstudio.com/
HOLO!!! So recently I read a beauty hack article. It said that you can use Elmer's Glue as your peel-off base Taco... Truth? False? Please investigate!!!
You should do your an induction holographic like in the beginning when your fingernail polish it should be a holographic
My fucking step mom thinks that holo is fucking tiny pieces of metal that reflect light. Ugh non holosexuals make me so mad
I don't know if I'm crazy, but Holoflakes 5 seemed like more of the flakes were being transferred onto the nail... Idk.. lol
Cristine has to be the biggest holo dealer in the YouTube game. \n-say no to drugs-
.' Cristine ! Try This 💖 https://youtu.be/oWez0roGEC8 it'd be fun to try 💖
Make a holo taco with shane dawson!!

Cristine you should do what Jenna did with Julien, but with Ben!! 😄
You should do the 100 layer challenge with the holo flakes on your nails
Christine try to make a video but for the whole time you can't cuss and you have to pretend your a child😂good luck with that @simplynaillogical
i love holo to but i think this was to much i think i am blink
Legit thought the beginning was an advertisement nd i was like what in the fuck is this shit. Then i realized it wasnt and start laughing my ass off.

https://www.facebook.com/VICE/videos/697422923789646/ saw this nail art thought you'd get a kick out of
when i first started watching simply nailogic, my first impression of her was, crazy good nail lady who likes holo and talks about death a lot
We need to add Hollaback Girl to the holo hits volume 3
I feel like I was being hypnotized throughout the whole video. My mouth was like wide open
People in my middle school keep calling holo sparkles and I keep saying now ots holo UGHHHHHH and they walk away slowly
Ben should make his own channel
Bake that sh*t for a minute

Why did the chicken cross the road\n\n\n\nTO GET TO CRISTENS VIDEO UGH DUHH (btw im the chicken)
You have to find the num noms nail polish maker
Christine! You should totally get snapchat spectacles so you can do swatches and all the holo nail stuff without holding your phone 🤘😁💅😎

Today i got a scracht NEXT TO MY CUTICAL
She should play flour tower with holo powder with Ben!
After seeing that much holo, I think I've gone blind.
get christine, see if you can find a cosmetic makeup glitter brand called _GIRLACTIC GLITTER_ I once purchased the most gorgeous explosive copper penny glitterific fine but amazing little pot of face glitter and I have a distinct memory of there being an incredible array of chromie and holo-ie and sparkly madness shade options... it was pricey at 14$ for a teensy weensy little micro nickle sized container but it was pure phucken light reflective MAGIC.
You look like lara flynn on a babys day out lol
Cristine  I need  you to do your make up but with nail polish pleeez. Do.... it 4 my chameleon his name is golumn.... he loves u

When I went to walmat I told my mom who the women in the picture to buy me everything holo she said wth is that and I said Holographic and she said ohh Christine I said what the duck mom how do you know her
My friends at school keep shouting at me when they ask what time it is and i say it's Fuken tea time bitch! From one of your older videos 😂😂
i had to wear sunglasses
This was truly beautiful. Thank you Holomom!
Did anyone else think she said 'geometrical sharts' instead of 'geometrical shards'? Just me? Okay...
I died at the 'intro'

Christine I thing u need to watch this https://youtu.be/VaNzsXz9XYQ
You should make Ben's glasses holo and I mean the frame not the glass. You should use the buffing method on the frame of his glass with the holo flakies. Please Please make a video on it.
PLEASE DO IT MOVIE NAILS ❤️🤡
My friend has a holo bag and my art teacher said to her \n girl with the SILVER backpack turn around \nSILVER \nMOTHER FRICKIN SILVER 😡

Should of been 4 or 5 Leeds got off lightly ... COYL
I would have loved an offside cam on Morison on that first one.
MILLLLLLLLL
Milllllllll
I can only imagine how much fun josh is having right now. Poor simon
5k views and this is 5th on trending. gg YouTube.
Why the hell is this trending in India?
Great goal keeping...that's all I have to say...🤐
play offs why not never say never
Millwall the laughing stock of London
I bet Millwall payed YouTube to put this on trending
Bad day at the office for leeds but credit to millwall they were all over us and fully deserved the win. Good luck for the rest of the season mfc apart from when u play us again obviously. MOT
WHAT IS IN TRENDING IN SERBIA???
Leeds are shit who agrees like rhis
Trending !!!!?!!
MILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
ALAW
Trending? YouTube go home your wasted.
millwall. fuck em all
Mill wall pricks
AOB like Chicharito with the deflected shots in :D
Total domination.1-0 mullering if ever there can be one.
I watched this live a guy fell down the Millwall steps and cut his head open blood everywhere he was drunk
Offside u scums
The only time millwall will show up all season. Mark my words.
Well done Millwall from a Wednesday fan! We all hate Leeds scum.
Middlesbrough fan but what a block by qpr on the goal line
3rd goal was off
What an interesting game.
trffcv
another loss under holloway, stats are apalling, i agree the ball was out for boro third goal
Screenshot, looks just out to me.\ns26.postimg.org/3mkgxujh3/out.jpg
That ref and linesman are a joke,that was obviously over the line
QPR two very lucky goals Boro made hard work of it UTB
We still didn't deserve to win. Our second goal was very scrappy
Trending with 7.3k views? Hah
Go on furlong lad 👏
UTB
WHAT THE FUCK LINO
Qpr have more youtube subscribers then stadium capacity lol
After it was 2-2 I new Middlesbrough would score a third cause it's QPR and we also through it away.
Why is this trending tho?
The ball was out of play for their 3rd goal?!
Your fuckin shit
Deserved at least a point.
This is sad and creepy af. \nDude whacks it off and makes some good cash 💰 and reunites with his kids on a tv special (probably to make more cash) almost 20 to 25 years later and he's a great guy\nWtf is this world coming to? (no pun intended)
how do you feel when have an unsupportive family who always want you to work for others while you internally insist on creating your own empire? i am done with life
MR. STARBUCKS!
all ugly next
Jon Snow and the 7 bastard dwarves
lmao they all have his nose
If I had a kid every time I masturbated, I would populate a whole continent by now.
We came from your semen\nHehehehehehehehehhehehe\n\n\nIts from Family Guy
Well, I guess you get what you pay for...
Mike's been keeping his hands busy
This is so wholesome. Don't even bother reading the comments though.
This is the weirdest family reunion I've ever seen.
Family guy did it
just because your a sperm donor doesn't make you their father.. what makes the media.. and these kids.. and this guy think its ok to pretend he cares.. He donated sperm for quick cash.. not because he wanted kids..
saving the white race, one sperm at a time
Lucky man some people don't have children in will love  to donate?
wait for the alimony of good luck
1:31 she looks like Scarlett Johansson the voice is similar too
This nigga's been copy and pasted onto a woman's body
Cool. I'm sure the others who chose to be anonymous probably unknowingly had sex with one of their offspring 😯😰😖
they all have the same nose.
You know some of those boys where thinking damn it I have so many hot sisters.
When the squad hasn't seen eachother in forever. I'm sorry... I try.
White people doing the most
what's ur dad like? i wanna meet that dad
His pull out game is weak
WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST WATCH
-We have our daddys sperm in common
1:54 thinks his son is Tom Cruise
Well... This is the future guys.
hmmm he's a sexy dad
I think it's nice that he helped other people to have children and those children appreciate him enough to visit him; he'll never spend a lonely day in his life. I don't think there's anything wrong with it. Thanks Mike
Now I can just imagine like a boyfriend and a girlfriend in the morning getting ready, and the dudes like ''Jessica I'm going out to see my dad'' and then Jessica's like ''yeah me too!'' And then they get there and go in the door and they're like ''JUSTIN?!'' ''JESSICA?'' And then they have really incest kids
I keep thinking that episode of family guy where Peter meets his sperm donor kids, who knows what i'm talking about :))
Most of his kids turned out beautiful/handsome. I don't blame the moms for picking his sperm, good choice. But i did hear about some women picking a sperm donor who was mentally insane and lied on the papers.
There were no conception problems, their mothers were all so ugly, no guy in his right mind was going to throw the hotdog down the hallway. That's why the donor is so handsome and his kids so ugly.
Wtf is this doin in my trending?I'm a jaffa
Did his kid just call him mike? 1:45 I'd be getting a can of whoop ass if I called my dad by his name lol 😂
This Guy Must Be Petter North.....
If he was black, the comments would be TOTALLY different. Every stereotype under the sun would be spewed and no facts would be considered.
2:00 stroking a dog suggests passion for animals?
Americans have a weird funny face. It's like they all squint.
А мужик молоток, и детей наплодил, гены свои передал, и от воспитания увернулся на совершенно законных основаниях.
Вообще мужик не выглядит счастливым, скорее расстроенным. В его глазах читается: как вы меня все зае***ли, дети мои. Самое забавное что почти все дети похожи между собой.
Американец Майкл Рубино в молодости был донором спермы. Недавно он встретился со своими 19 биологическими детьми.
Family Guy Predicted this
Family guy?\nAnyone?\nNo? Hahaha
He needs to be called by his name or Mr. Sperm Donor.....to call him Dad is an insult to every Man that has actually  MADE ALL OF THE SACRIFICES to RAISE THE CHILD.
I bet some of them sleep together in the past no wonder some of them has shame on their faces.
2:23 I have a feeling she says it alot, if you know what I mean
I wish I'm good looking and tall as a man... i'm only 5'4 and can't donate sperm for money. Literally free money.
And all you jerk offs out here just waste your cum for nothing
I honestly wonder if any of the kids were attracted to each. There is a phenomenon that causes incest with separated family members.
Goes to show being fat isn't genes but habits one tht  fat girl lol
Wow
19 kids and counting, lol
にてる！！
now thats 19 kids and counting
Delivery Man
Anonymous his ass
Child #9, please.
Ummm...what?!
Wow!!
Wierd
Dad?
Julhreeze
Hell no
seems like a maury episode
lmao
Man, if I found out I had 18 half brothers and sisters, the last I would want to do is meet them. I barely talk to the two I have.
ages 16-21 my ass most of them look 30
LMAO at 1:47 two of the girls have Snapchat filters on the photos he framed and put on his mantle. 😂💀
It's so sweet how open he was to getting to know all of them meanwhile so many actual fathers take zero interest or responsibility for their kids
It'd be kinda nice to be a part of that.
I can't remember the name of the movie. It's exactly like this
19 kids and counting
Aww
Он за один раз сделал столько клонов? Или 19 раз включал свой принтер?
Delivery man anyone?
Delivery Man
Yuck
Hello number 9
Lmfao
They're mostly attractive
wow number 9 is looking fineeeee
Décadence sociétal
tf
Damn not bad looking kids.
Nie jedną by wyruchał jeszcze :v
IS HE MY DAD OR GRANDPA BECAUSE MY LAST NAME IS RUBINO AND IVE NEVER MET ANYONE WITH THAT LAST NAME BESIDES FAMILY
Guys a Racist no black kids
He masturbates a lot
All raised by crazy cat ladies who couldn't find a man.  This is not ok.
So did they all shake his hand first?
Think the fat one blames being fatcon genetics ?
So every time you Jerk Off and dispose your cum. Does that count as murder?
Aww, that's so adowable!
I wouldve never made these ugly children
*Cringy af*
So 19 women, decided they wanted him? To be there sperm donor. And that means 19 women were single moms, because none of the kids had previous dad figures in there life....wow im shocked. None of those moms could find a husband

No coincidence that the first time arsenal have ever looked like not getting thumped by a big time is when ozil doesn't play. That was the most solid arsenal defensive/midfield performnce vs a big team in years. Deserved point for both teams. Arsenal barely created anything second half but considering they are away from home draw Fair result
Harvey Price long lost father
Robbie, you've been sniffing the coke haven't you
if arsenal i will be very happy to start my monday 😄
Robbie if you keep saying Kolasinac's name wrong he gonna eat you
We are never up for these games. I have absolutely no confidence in Wenger. We are never ready and prepared.
I'm sick of it Robbie
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS!
have you received your coaching badge yet?
If arsenal loses ty will say we still can win the league
You can't beat us at full strength thou!
Robbie thinking about a new car after todays game
Sumfin had some bubble at the border an got in some barney wiv the rozzers coz he ain't got enuff bangers in is rocket for a week long stay so the home office told im to bugger orf up is own end
I don't watch football. But this guy sounds important.
Robbie's got the sniffles
Is that the M1 just north of Dunstable you're driving on?
15-0 South Africa in the 12th inning of the second round. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNailed it.
come then you muppets, its dead innit, all the critics dashed
Notice how he's such a slow driver that he never drives past another car but he is always being overtaken
My boys, chelsea fc keeping it real, unlucky on your win
How was your entertaining draw?\nhttps://www.google.de/amp/s/talksport.com/football/listen-arsenal-fan-praises-fantastic-cologne-supporters-i-wish-gunners-fans-were%3famp
0-0chelsea/arsenal\nif I get it right you need to sub to my channel
As usual just lately it will depend upon which arsenal team shows up ,we have proven we can beat them!!!!!!!!!!!...but ill settle for a point,
My brother said if arsenal wins he will swim in the River Don 😂
he only got up for the match for the views
he has alexis on the bench like wtf... iwobi is starting
how can you not love Robbie? i aint even a arsenal fan but i just love him troopz+DT true passionate fans
You cant miss this game ? ?  I dont understand what is so special about getting humiliated .
I guarantee if Chelsea win this video will be deleted
Shame Sanchez is not starting but still a great lineup got Kolasinac powering down the wing he will cause trouble, then we can bring Sanchez on later to finish them #COYG
The small pitch doesn't suit arsenal
i feel like everyone thinks Chelsea is gonna win then arsenal gonna win and people gonna be shocked.people gonna cheer when they thought arsenal was gonna win wtf
If he start the right team we are going to be a victor trust Lacazzette  will score alongside Alexis.
We are going to win with 0:6💪💪💪
Dude I'm waiting for your post match cries 😂😂
4-1 Chelsea, Xhaka red card. Sorry but we're terrible like that. Wenger will of course blame the ref etc.
Robbie is ill..they gonna bottle it again..im a goonner but it's the reality
Robbie's comments...,I can only say I wish,lets have Laca,Sanchez and Ozil all on and on fire. then maybe  Robbie will be right
I'd take a draw tbh
Not feeling very optimistic today. But hey anything can happen
Super Sunday \n1)Chelsea vs Arsenal 13:30\n2)Man United vs Everton 16:00\n3) Arsenal  Fan Tv and chill 19:00\n4) Arsenal
If ozil is missing in this game then it might be a blessing in disguise for us
Don't bring ya rainbow sickness to SW6 lol
how is this on trending 😂😂
0-0 not bad....\n\nChelsea are shite this year...
We played second team against Cologne ??? \nWhat match was i watching LOL\nwe played our first team in europa Robbie.. Only ozil ,ramsay and laca didn't play.. (Xhaka being there not being there doesn't really make any difference)
Draw would be a good result for us but i hope we would win it
Get this shit off trending now
1 sniff 2 sniff 3 sniff
Lol this is on trending
5-0 Arsenal. Mark. My. Words.
1000th like

Have to give Arsenal credit today they were solid all day but poor in the final 3rd #MUFC
Good game. Everyone played well apart from iwobi!  He looked lost and just looked lazy.Even ramesy played well
COYGGGG....SHOW SOME FIGHT! We have to make sure were not exposed at the back, like we were against Liverpool.
HAHAHAHAHA TRIFFIC RESULT FOR SPURS
Why is this trending now lol
Blame the whitey right?
Why is this trending? But it's cool. One day I will be on trending
Why does every show about black people somehow have to mention how much they hate white people lmao
Season 2's finished, why is this trending now?
nice job youtube
damnnnn back at it again with the frank ocean stuff woohwooooh
white people complaining in the comment section.....don't worry be happy 😂
Liberals have lost their fucking minds, who on earth would want to watch this? A TV show about a black tranny?  I'm about to vomit
Someone said this is the fresh breed of black privilege and embodies typical rich BLM members. I haven't seen it but that's what people telling me
This is blackwashing. Why are there any white people in this?
What's with the white people hating?

Shit tv show shit acting shit black people
I remember the first time I watched Issa it was on Awkward Black Girl i still watch it on youtube
Why the fuck is this trending,.? Hardly believable. YouTube is not even trying to hide the trending manipulation anymore.
My boy Anderson .Paak🔥🔥🔥
trending im not watching this trash
IT 2017 full movie\nhttp://kibuilder.com/2GUt
Anderson paak ayyy
Pure ideological propaganda
What song is that just after the minute mark
See, I get it. Its an all black cast. That's okay. There should be variety for people to find a show that they find relatable...but in game of thrones, Rick and morty, breaking bad, Shows that mainly feature white people or white writers, at no point imply they 'hate black people' by having one of the characters do something or say something racist.\nSo why do we think its okay for shows like this to have an underlying hit at white people?
HBO is going downhill. A shame but every company has to peak at some point.
Where the white women at????
Not sure why I passed on this when it first premiered, but this show looks good.
In real black relationships the man beats the women and then leaves her and the kids to somehow make it. So I'm not really buying the whole gimmick of class and good manners that this show is trying to portray the black community as having. Maybe add in a scene of a black man squealing 'WELL DO IT THEN NIGGA!!' at one of the women who then swings her handbag at him and gets savagely knocked out to the chorus of 'WORLDSTAR!'.................then I will tune in and watch.
What is songs?
I will sub to anyone who subs me when you are done comment done:)
Paulinho 👏👏👏
Sorry for doubting You Goatlinho....
MSN is not there anymore 😢😢😢😭
Eu sei que ninguém vai entender, mas vamo lá Paulinho
Messi will always be Messi no matter wat..thanks for the pass
http://www.ermail.com/klik/UHJQamcM\nHey Guys check on this link and have fun.  Great to enjoy.  Have fun and earn and good game too.
Please, next time don't put final score on the title. Thank you
Dembele is out for half the season 4-5 months
how can barca be this bad?? it doesn't make any sense...
Glory supports are real in these comments thinking they know shit stfu 10 year olds
Spanish people are fucking retarded, look how their commentators sound
Predict sound credibility born obviously international orange freeze gate even.
Why is pique still in the squad? He's just getting older and horrible as a defender. Time to drop him asap
That freekick by messi was so good and the goalkeeper managed to make a world class save. The curve was perfect, what a save from the goalkeeper.
Gaku Shibasaki👍\nProud of him being Japanese🇯🇵
pliz dont discuss signings... its over now ,more over d coach know how to use them n at what position ..juz enjoy barca ...d beauty of football....gr8 goals nyways
What a goal by the Japanese dude!! And what a save on Messi's free kick!
Barcelona's defend is fantastic with umtiti and semedo
Pique was terrible in this game
Who else want semedo in starting eleven like
Remember these are the sort of games barca lost or drew last season which cost them la liga. So a brilliant start.
If you say goal again i hope your mother dies of cancer
He is strong.. He can be a false number 9😐
Is Barcelona become AS Roma??? jk
The Getafe goal was from Mars .
WE THE FANS OF BARCELONA, castigated PAULINHO....why? I mean seriously PAULINHO .....he is coming to D GREAT BARCELONA....NO PLZ ...but when he arrived to d great Barcelona,  MY Realmadrid, MU, Chelsea  fans  made fun of me and they used to say this is the level of barcelona ......What I replied them...wait and watch bcoz we are just fans and don't know the capability of other players who played in different countries and with different clubs....SCOUTS R THERE....and they brought him to D GREAT BARCELONA......IT MEANS, SOMETHING IS THERE........AND NOW important 3 PTS, due to this 3 pts, last  year we lost laliga .....
Where are the fouls done on suarez which shd have been penalties
FC Roma xD? 3rd kit is similar to roma no?
Asian football is improving, Japan has a very strong national side so does Iran! And China is starting to get on the right track as they are spending billions on the football not only buying big names from abroad but also on its youth program! I see China to top Asia in the next two decades time! They will have a very bright future
A clear penalty for getafe and a red card for pique but as always UEFAlona gets away with it
Neymar one of the best player out off the team but messi is wonderful
This team is nothing. They might as well trade Suarez and Messi.
5:03 lol, look at Jordi Alba getting on his knees! It´s been a while since Leo shot a freekick like that.
നെയ്മർ ഇല്ലങ്കിൽ നമ്മൾ ജയികും
La Liga stadiums always seem to have empty seats lol.
Ter Stegen again & again. Making same mistake like he did last time vs Real Madrid. He should learn to stay at goalpost to widened the distance & increase the chance to block long shoot. If he doesn't learn this, sooner or later he will end up being burden to the team again. Neuer, Navas & Buffon have better knowledge on this
He scored 1 goal wtf why is everyone bumming him now
Dembele is the new Odegaard.
เปาลินโญ่ สุดยอดมากครับ
NOOOO WHY DEMBOUZ?😢❤
Vai Corinthians Paulinho
Paulinho = Vai CORINTHIANS.
Lord Paulinho scored!!!
This is cool
messi did a good shot 😵😵
Dembelé  120 kilos ,   JA JA JA JA JA
Where is messi goal? Oh wait....
Wow barcea

Notification squad!!!
Hi
OH ME GERSH!!!!!
*JENKINS*
I was watching a different Madeyewlook video when I got this notification lol.
You are so amazing. Its so satisfing watching you do your art. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!
Ah yes, the advancement and progressiveness of science creating a physically inferior underclass under the guise of preservation of precious limited resources further strengthened by the false security of the small ones feeling rich. Too bad once you're that small you've essentially signed away your freedom forever, as you are physically helpless from now on. But hey, you have millions of dollars that you can spend... that is, if the big people will allow you to have things. So go to your mini mansion in your little AAA battery powered toy smart car and wait to die so that the giants can inherit the earth. If enough people were this small, the few remaining big ones could do whatever they wanted and eventually quit caring for those little villages, abandoning them and leaving the little ones to fend for themselves against the big bad world. It's natural selection with a little bit of help from science. \n\nOf course the exact process is impossible. But if the majority of the world could be duped into permanently adopting a certain way of life such as this for the greater good, the remaining ones with true freedom would then rule and be able to do whatever they want. That's what is unsettling to me. One day people will begin permanently signing away their freedoms because they believe they're doing some good and they'll find themselves inferior and even worse off than they were before, subject to the rule of those who seized power for themselves and their families when they saw the chance.
Please tell me that this is a comedy.
Are they gonna shrink every snake, spider, croc, cockroach etc....., nahh screw that , what a way to die being a frogs dinner...
More hysterical propaganda. \n\nLike all animals, human population is limited by available resources, it doesn't just skyrocket exponentially. The First World is not at risk of overpopulation, we are actually facing under-population due to our declining birth rate (an effect of prosperity among the enlightened, unfortunately). It's exclusively the Third World experiencing rampant population growth, and specifically on the back of Western aid--what do you think will happen once those resources inevitably dry up?
Matt Damon and Talking Heads Once in a Lifetime  brought me here....\n\n\n\n\nKristen Wiig  isn't  bad either.
this is all cool, until a fucking wasp flies by. no thanks.
The conflict has something to do with him having to go to court, maybe getting a divorce, the one clip is of him signing really large legal papers.
So he downsizes but then his wife doesn't and it is permanent so he now has to explore and find his way through the new world.
Don't even think about it!  I talking to YOU,world governments and secret sec's!   #TheShitStormIsComing
I like the creativity they put to bring something new...
Part two of this movie will be war with ants 😂
#♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥♥  #♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥  #♥♥♥♥\n*Based on love alone. God sent His Son Jesus Christ to die in our place. Then on the third day rose Him  from the dead.*\n*Now, though Jesus Christ alone. God has granted us the free gift of eternal life. He will save and heal you, if you ask Him.*
And the whole colony gets eaten by a pack of rats.
downscripting
More horseshit propaganda by the Oligarchs. Enjoy your preprogramming faggots
Good Will Shrinking?
so... the borrowers???
Eagle food
And then their immune systems fail?
I approve of the song choice.
I was smiling the whole time! Wow!
This is the whitest movie for white people ive ever seen.
Release date 22nd Dec?  Why advertise so early?
Dino age is back
We're not facing overpopulation. \nIts the Chinese, India and Africa that are facing overpopulation. China and India can get a free pass to wage war on each other and we cut off foreign aid and introduce the ZIKA virus to Africa.
What if it rains?
OK. Did anyone else think how any downsized person vs insects would be fucked?
My guess: The Truman Show meets The Island meets Nineteen Eighty Four.
Great...now you got to watch out for giant killer ants 🐜 amongst a litany of predators.
Damn what did you do to me?! Now I wish I could downsize lol
Bettin it turns out that the the wife is not down 4 downsizing so you can imagine whats going in the double bed. Key word: Speleologist
I cant wait someone step on them, that would be awesome.
I don't want get caught in the rain when downsized.
Are birds some predators for them now ?
Sideways is my all time favorite movie
So what are we some kind of downsizing?
Feel like the trailer showed that Kristin Wiig backs out of it.
What if some insect comes by? Thinking about giant spiders gives me nightmares.
Just go to google and simply type: *gexxguides* You'll get the only real working clash of clans working tool in the 2017
So they have the technology to shrink people but not colonize other planets? Little odd
Wait... notice how Kristen Wiig doesn't appear after Matt Damon is shrunk? Maybe she backs out or dies during the downsizing?
Something is not right with this movie I mean it's just too good to be true.
Wouldn't the voices actually sound really high pitched at that size?
It would just take 1 praying mantis to wipe off leisure land.
I can't wait for Cinema Sins with Neil DeGrass Tyson on this...
This is such a fucking unique idea I've never seen. Wow!
Right for the people talking about the spiders etc. \nThey have their own environment, safe if you ever took a second to look there's a Big ass land for them. No spiders or any other bullshit. :)
This creeps me out a lot more than it should...
What about cockroaches and spiders and all the other creepy crawlers?  F**k that!!!
Obviously gravity is a big problem when shrunk to this size but of course its just a movie....
The revolutions in surgery!
looks like an interesting idea but makes u wonder who would still wanna continuing working after being Downsized if their money translates to something u can retire on. I'm talking about those movers
Does Antman make a cameo or...?
Plot Twist, the movie is the ant bully but on a full scale.
Make em all small, then wipe em out with boot strikes! We could have more of everything for ourselves!
So the kids born from the downsized individuals would be downsize for the rest of their lives.\n\nThis would end up creating two separate classes of human beings. One the normal ones and the other the downsized ones. \nTensions would arise and then who would win. Are we seeing the start of the bleak apocalyptic movie franchise
Hang on. How can the normal sized people hear the small people. They'd be talking at very high frequencies.
Somehow, nobody in this movie seems to have a clue that when you are smaller, you don't react the same to gravity.
I don't think the main problem here is bug or animals.It's the people who doesn't shrink.The tiny city is protected by these people and they build a dome to prevent other things to come in.And I doubt that they will make tiny guns.\nSo what if those people don't want to protect them,and try to rule them all?What can you do to fight them?As about 6 inches high,you can't fight them physically,cause to be honest,a normal can just step on you and crush you into nothing.You can't out run them,within one step they will catch up you and you're dead.Even you drive your tiny car,they can just run to you and stomp on the car with you in it and squashed it like a soda can,and you are also dead.\nEven if tiny people has their own tiny military,I can say one normal size marine can take down at least 100 tiny marine.He can just lay down on them and crush them all in to nothing.And your tiny guns won't do any harm to a normal size marine,they can't even penetrate their gear and won't gonna penetrate the sole of boots.\nSo what about heavy weapons?Sure,that would do some damage,but don't forget the normal size people has that too.They can just launch one missile and your whole city is gone.When you shrunk,you are inferior to all the other people who didn't shrink.\nAnd they give you 240 times money that can only be used in that city.The rich or the powerful just don't care these,cause they are already live a great life.But those who don't have a lot money will consider this,it's easier to live in the tiny city than outside.\nSo this movie reveal a new era of slavery and that what I thought about this movie.
I was waiting for them all to be attacked by insects/rats/birds, drowned by a small rain shower or for the people who didn't shrink to turn on them (since their basically helpless) and that being their real solution to over population...Apparently I am either way more cynical than I thought or general stupidity brings out the worse in me.
That's Dave ! Dave Johnson ! And Caroll !\nALRIGHT BUT I WANT TO KNOW IF THAT'S A PORTAL REFERENCE
It's like the Attack on Titan but different.
So that's it huh? we're some kind of Downsizing?
A bit confused by this, what's the conflict of the story? Will we have to wait until later trailers to see what the struggles are?
You know there is going to be a scene where they're running from a bunch of seagulls. I bet there will be.
This is a good concept!\nBut think about this,\nThere will be Bugs, Animals,And maybe people who don't want to do this or maybe terrorists \nWhich are bigger than Them and can Pretty much kill Us Humans just by stepping on Humans
and then hurricane comes...
Go down to the size of a grasshopper? That affects lots of things. A lot of animals just got added to our list of dangerous predators. Water surface tension? Strength-to-weight ratio lets us jump much higher. Hailstorms can wreck shit on our property. We need around one billion of us to remain regular-sized to watch over all human activities.
The inventor's name better be Wayne Szalinski. That's all I'm saying.
Seems innovative and fun, but where is the conflict??
Great film! I recommend seeing it
I came here from Once In A Lifetime by the Talking Heads
Looks great... Till the bugs come..
I hope we don't discover Pym particles. Shrinking the human population would make more problems then it solves
If you herre that small, you would have died becasue of lack of oxygen and suffer blindness
and ants got into the mini city and killed everyone. this would be a great horror movie premise
God this movie is wrong in every way...
I think the sex perverts would capture you, then insert you into their anus.
How are they gonna deal with heavy rain or tornadoes?
My wife had me searching for mark wahlbergs new film, she meant this one the stupid cow.
Finally an original idea 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
What if it rains?
wait.. so if they downsize, what will happen to their brain? will their IQ also be downsized, so we will end up with a movie with the combined IQ of a  chimp?
1:52 i have a feeling this conflict is going to be people get drawn in with nice stuff expensive things they wouldnt normally have and then they get fucked over. and its like what are you gonna do, tell em no? youre tiny fam no ones gonna listen to you
My cat would kill them.
Operator : 911 Emergency!!! \nMatt : These creepy RATS are attacking my villa to eat me and my wife.\nOperator : Sir, Hold on, Rodent Control Services are on there way right now. Just don't get caught. Happy Downsizing
WHAT the FUCK i am SO IN
that looks completely insane yet i really wanna watch it
I bet Ant-Man feels pretty stupid now.....
fcking pym particle! getting out of hand...
That's cute 😊😊
JASON AND KRISTEN???? AND MATT?? AND CHRISTOPH??????? WOW
what ? what? whaaaaattt?
interesting, intriguing, original, will definetelly watch it
Black Mirror anyone?

lyrics, in case you wanna see the video and sing the song at the same time :\n\nI wonder, maybe they'd never find me\nI've been waitin' such a long, long, long time to feel it\nSwallowed by the waters around me\nThough I took so many wrong, wrong, wrong turns to see it, woah\n\nBut I dance through the blisters at night\nAnd I laughed 'til I cried and cried and\nI ran 'til my feet couldn't run no more (no more, no more)\nAnd I sang 'til my lungs were burnin'\n'Til I know I'm alive, alive, yeah\nI'll sit 'til I can't hear words no more\n\nSuddenly the sun comes up\nAnd I feel my love floodin' back again, yeah\nUntil the sun goes up\nAnd I feel my love comin' up again\nSuddenly the sun comes up\nAnd the dark is gone\nWe made it to the dawn and I don't miss you anymore\nWhen the sun comes up\nI can feel my love comin' back again\n\nIt wasn't easy tryin' to run with these handcuffs\nI had to sleep through such a cold, cold, cold night to see it\nGreen flashes hit me right where I'm standing\nSunlight cut into your bones, bones, bones, started to heal it\n\nOh, oh, I danced through the blisters at night\nAnd I laughed 'til I cried and cried and\nI ran 'til my feet couldn't run no more (no more, no more)\nAnd I sang 'til my lungs were burnin'\n'Til I know I'm alive, alive, yeah\nI'll sit 'til I can't hear words no more\n\nSuddenly the sun comes up\nAnd I feel my love floodin' back again, yeah\nUntil the sun goes up\nAnd I feel my love comin' up again\nSuddenly the sun comes up\nAnd the dark is gone\nWe made it to the dawn and I don't miss you anymore\nWhen the sun comes up\nI can feel my love comin' back again\n\nGive a little light\nTo get a little love back\nGive a little light\nTo get a little love back\nGive a little light (won't you give it?)\nTo get a little love back (give your love back)\nGive a little light (won't you give it?)\nTo get a little love back (shine your light on me)\nGive a little light (give a little, to get a little love)\nTo get a little love back (to get a little love back)\nGive a little light (to get a little love back)\n\nOh, dance through the blisters at night\nI laughed 'til I cried and cried and\nI ran 'til my feet couldn't run no more (no more, no more)\nI sang 'til my lungs were burnin'\nI'm alive, alive\nI can't hear words no more\n\nSuddenly the sun comes up\nAnd I feel my love\nSun comes up again, my love\nUntil the sun comes up\nAnd I feel my love comin' up again (I feel my love)\nI can feel my love, I can feel my love\n\nSun comes up\nI can feel my love comin' back again

I don't usually leave comments under YouTube videos but Rudimental, you have done me so proud. The video is absolutely outstanding. Superb. Exactly how I depicted it in my mind. How is that even possible. Not many songs strike up so much emotion within me, thank you for being you, Rudimental❤️
this song makes me feel happy....thanks rudimental and james arthur your awesome
Best feature... So in love
this song is everything
love this video for the song!!!
To all deejays, please don't make a remix of this song, you can't do better.
Lmao wtf is this though
This really is cringe worthy. Future sounds extra robotic singing next to Cher 😨 It just does not sound right!!
Hey the King and Queen of Auto-Tune lol....
Cher THICKKKK
I like share.
LOVE LOVE LOVE
Sensational
YUKARI
Df
Cher THICK
Wait he cant sing and he didnt even try in the position of a person who can sing? So stupid how he is famous.
Please stop playing this ad. It's literally the only ad I see now
This ad has me wanting more..would love to hear them sing that entire song.
i have never seen, anything that was such utter trash........................not Cher, loved her, her voice was amazing love it, but dear god, remove future from this thing plzzzzzz xD lol
This may be the worst commercial of all time. I'd rather see Michael Jackson's hair catch fire.
he sounds like a robot
Damn her voice is deep af
She looks stunning than ever, this woman is eternal 💙
That didn't at all sound like Cher and Future added literally nothing. This was just awful altogether. Cher looks like she's been molded out of melted plastic.
Thank God this song is just a commercial looool. Thought I was watching a bad Sesame Street episode with these lyrics lol Who in the world let this ad happen? This is such a bad commercial all around! Most incompatible combination of artists, they're certainly not every day people, the beat is terrible for Cher's voice tone, and poor Future is just her autotuned hype man. You can tell they're not excited to be there lol When Cher sings my own beliefs are in my song, her eyes tell you this line is so stupid
hahaha is this a joke?\nyuk, after the laughter subsided, I became seriously ill.\nI have been violated.  Help me i have been poisoned by this trash. \neerrrggghhhh wtf is this  disgusting crap?
She's not a really good singer she has a pitch in her vocals
The Music was pollution to my ear drums 😩
When's the mixtape dropping?
I can't stop watching this
Cher is Dope! Future in this Ad....Ummmm NOT! I just don't like Dude! But, Cher All Day!
WTF !!!!! Hahahahha future
Omg I love this😍😍😍😍
Genius....
Cher got the wagon
she knew exactly what to do with that beat. cher is amazing !
This is autotuned to hell. I don't want to have to listen to their trashy voices everytime I watch a video.
Cher I love you!!!3!;;❤❤❤❤❤
LOVE IT!! /
but why though.. lmaooo
Only here cuz Zaytoven made the beat
I think thier going to make good music together
I don't know who the hell Future is but I feel like he doesn't even know the words to the song until Cher sang them and he just copied.
the king and queen of autotune
I read a comment about Gap bridging two generations together and I instantly thought although they sell everyday clothing they sfill keep it looking hip. I feel like Cher and Future were supposed to represent that that look. Yeah? No? Lol idk just a thought
Yikes. That did not work. Like, at all.
beat????
That entrance tho!!! Yasss Queen you betta werk!!! 😍😘❤❤❤
Whoever wrote this song needs a new job
Why isn't this a full song?
Mi Diosa tan bella😍
CHER ,THE GODDESS
Two different generations combining making a masterpiece
Wow! Chad Michaels can sing to now
all i see in this commercial are the first 2 seconds lol
I didn't know that Thing 1 could sing.
I can't believe this is the finished commercial - I adore Cher & I think they could have chemistry, but like this? No.
Idol meets Icon...great marketing Gap. ❤️ it.
It's moments like this that confirms the theory that we're all dead but actually stuck into an alternate dimension.
Cher got cake
so cringe, #neverbuyingfromgap
Cher make another CD plssss
Qué bonita Cher
When I first seen this I was like wtf did I just watch.. now I'm loving this and need to hear a full version.
DISCOMBOBULATING
im not finna play future u better have gotten hella money for this.
Cher kinda thick
LEGENDS
Future...you don't have auto tune naturally coming out your voice box bro.
Its obvious Future is paying tribute to the Godmother of autotune. Before Tpain and Future it was Cher. Those down south autotune rappers look up to Cher
People who hate on this commercial why go on this video and comment about it ?
future meet future (..she will never die)
What a great out-of-the-box pairing. Love this commercial.
WHO ELSE GOT THIS ON LOOP
No joke this bout to be a fucking challege....everybody remember the barney theme song and the little einsteins. I just can't. Shooketh.
THIS IS SO GOOD WTF..... and no i'm not trolling.... i LOVE good music
Where is the long form version of the song.
Love both of them.
Cher went off!
WTF💀
Cher plz record this song!!!!
aaaahhhhh too much autotune.....it hurts my ears!!
Zaytoven 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Awesome
I was here.
love it.
I LOVE THIS...CHER IS SUCH A COOL BEAN...AWESOME💋❤
They look way too good for this Gap commercial. But I love Cher and Future
God please see it I never see but most importantly never to hear that noise ever again. Start to finish all wrong and why you thought you wanna pan in closer to a 70+ is beyond forgivable.
someone send kathy griffin into chers attic to see if there is some dorian grey-esque painting up in there.
Sweat shop manufacturing trying to clean up its image with a woman that's got more stitches than a pair of jeans. Oh, this world is so predictable. Sell out celebs
Who allowed this?
bad
CHER IS SO AMAZING. 71 😍 and 🔥
OG auto-tune with new school auto-tune. love it
I've been reading a lot about how this song is ... insert negative comments about Future, Cher's looks, the use of the song. You get my drift.\n\nI am very much behind the intent of this campaign and I enjoy its imperfections. It's about everyday people. Look beyond the capitalism and think - with all the ugly in the world. It's nice to see old and new come together and just be people.\n\nFor those who would criticize the use of a Sly and the Family Stone song. When are y'all going to understand how public domain is supposed to work? Wow thanks Walt Disney, the world doesn't understand how we as a community, a culture, as people evolve.
THIS WAS A BAD LOOK FOR FUTURE'S IMAGE AND WHAT HE REPRESENTS. YOU CAN'T JUST ACCEPT EVERY BAG OF MONEY THAT IS THROWN YOUR WAY. SOMETIMES YOU SHOULD SAY NO!!!
Do you believe in lean after love 🎤😭
Chad Michaels doing really well for himself
Too much autotune in 30 secs
Reminds of a typical scene from The Get Down
She sounds like a dude
I came here from a different  video because I thought future was singing  with a transgender  woman  🤦🏽
This is so fucking cringey.
Honestly one of the best ads I've seen in a while
Floyd Mayweather, the swimmer.
Favorite Fifth Harmony song?\nWho tf is that?\nJesus Christ Floyd there's more to life than strip clubs and being very rich. haha
One is too close to none lmao. Floyd is funny
I died at there's more to life than strip clubs and being very very rich! Hahahaha perfect!
When are you going to get divorced with Benita Diego
Is this really Rudy mancuso? He's way funnier than I expected
Lol this was great
This was the best interview I've ever seen.
😲 you are kill me oh my 70 girlfriend 🙏🙏🙏😲
That's a little nigger with a big bank account.
5:43 floyd waiting for the camera to go off is hilarious
Diego kinda sound like Rudy manusco I think that's how you spell it?
All Chimped Out.. The Dindu Nuffins idol and inspiration.. Wait until his homosexual sex tapes are released.. Transgender love has got all these gay boys
I'm dead!!! what bank you with bro? lololol
also if has 200-300 million in his bank, why can't he pay his taxes?
Moneyman, you are a true legend, and an example of and to successful individuals for all times.\n\nYour legendary 20-year focus and commitment to your boxing craft will never be ignored by those who can appreciate what success in life entails.\n\nWhen one can die or be seriously incapacitated in the ring by young, strong men the world over, it is so vital to be always in shape, be always ready, be always 'on top of your game', and always study and never underestimate any opponent.\n\nMany 'great' boxers have been clobbered by lesser opponents; because they lost their focus and foolishly underestimate some opponents.
Can I like borrow $20 dollars
That was way more entertaining than I expected it to be. In all honesty Floyd seems like a decent dude.
This was not funny
History won't be kind to Floyd.
I wish i could meet Floyd for just 1 hour! He's a living legend, its going to be a long time before somebody can eclipse him. Sick interview!
Financially mature, intellectually, the complete opposite.
lol why does this have so many views\nnvm this video is hilarious
This nigga so rich he is actually considering wiring money to a fucking PUPPET!\n\nLMAOOOOOO
If you don't stop what you're doing and watch my meme of this, you'll see something in your closet by 3am
Floyd, real shit. I loved this interview. You're actually pretty fucking funny.
Floyd is finally getting the respect and honour that he deserves. #Tbe
You should do one w canelo!!!!
That fight wasn't worth $100, but this interview sure was.
Boxing legend meets a puppet......has that not been already????
check my youtube channel out its called KPI’ERRE if you find me funny join the family and lets grow and im doing a iphone 8 giveaway at 500 subs and a iPhone x give away if i caan hit 1000 subs lets go
Is this the guy who Conor retired before the early stopage? Conor practically destroyed this dude knuckles with his face, same thing he did to Nate.
How did you get him to give you a interview?
I tried that one time and she punched me harder than u punched McGregor Lol 😂😂😂
Mayweather is the MAN! Bless him and his family.
I bet the puppet could beat Pac-Man
Is that puppet Rudy Mancuso it sounds like him
Diego sounds like rudy
sounds like mallignaggi
Lol
Lol funny interview

Floyd was getting mad for real......lmao
Floyd's the man👊👊👊
Floyd I wanna do a boxing with you smh I will win :) come on
Floyd mayweather's actually really funny hahah I didn't know
This shit wasn't funny usually your vids are funny
Jesus whats happening to me im turning into a conspiracy theorist... but so many references in his words to reptilian illuminati.. fav color green... he mentioned lucky number 7.. he got beady eyes.. he said he is too smooth skinned for hair..\n\nalso do you notice the racial undertone here? black man and hispanic man getting along talking about beating mcgregor. it was a mexican and black man who beat him. \n\ntell me somebody else notices this shit!
the interview was a tko
Hollywood should turn this into a movie, like Ted. Only with both of these guys.
Great stuff- Everyone should know this floyd...
This was fucking brilliant jesus christ...
Diego for life better than TMZ better than between 2 ferns ..
damn i don't even have a peins and i get a boner😂
Floyd's a legend😂😂😂
this channel has like almost 600k subs and he already has community... dang
Give us the Funnel Cake song please
Really starting to like Floyd.  Wasn't a fan before the McGregor fight.  Now a big fan.
Interview logan paul and jake paul
Floyd is not a bad person after all but why are there a lot of people hate him?
0:31 The death stare \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the funny moment

Isn't this song from the movie Ballerina??? (At the end)
The Song Is Verry Ennergetique And Very Hyper and the video is an upset for me
new hair style is terrible
A video pretending to be about the making of the actual video we are watching, in other words itself, is when meta gets effing annoying.
I love carly!! Shes such an amazing musician! I wish i get to meet her in real life...
What she is saying to me is you can't box her.....love the new look and sound!
Was hoping this song was gonna be the lead single off an upcoming album! Would've made a great lead to an awesome album!
DONA DA POHA TODA ! \n\nI loved, the clip 2017. <3
I feel like after EMOTION you were so underrated and I am so happy Spotify recommended this in my playlist.
wait she is not in a contract?
Queen of literally everything
This is one of my most fave songs from Emotion Side B+ and now it has a video! So cool.
Best song of 2017, hands down.
Omg she looks like the waitress from it's always sunny in Philadelphia with that hair!!
😊😊❤️❤️❤️Carly I love you 😍 😍😍new look ,very very very beautiful!!!!!!!!!
I'm missed her,, remember I'm pregnant Tom Hanks like Ohhkay just Kidding
Can someone explain me why she's too underrated?
I was so happy to hear they playing this song at the malls :))
Literally the worst video released this year.\nAnd released months too late.\nWho is in charge of this?!!
LOVE IT SO MUCH <3
Damn Damn Damn, Love These Kinds Of Music ♥♥♥

QUEEN OF CUTTING TO THE FEELING
I love this girl! she is always happy! She brings peace. always turn life into a different level.
The cinematography of this video = on point!
This song makes me dream about my dream boyfriend x)
QUEEN OF MAKING GREAT COFFEE ON SET
all her songs are perfect..
Queen of making good coffee 1:25
I just like that she's happy.
I don't like the video. I think she could make a better music video for this song.
For a friend for love.
I can see this song being played in Forever 21
Best pop singer of all time, sooo angelic, favorite single singer of all time by far, I love Carly so much. <3

Pudo hacer un vídeo excelente ya que la canción es buena, una fiesta o algo alegre, pero no... Hizo esto 😢
one hit wonder
Marvel Vs Capcom infinite ft. kinder surprise eggs.
Weak Graphics, weak roster, and some cheap dollar store easter eggs for $200? Yikes they shot themselves in the leg with this one
NO HSIEN-KO I CRY....I ALREADY BOUGHT IT. RIP ME.
I made a very bad decision.
No wonder he isn't mad, he got it for free
Game is worth a buy, but not the CE
Wtf is with the easter eggs?
I don't care about the infinity stones, just the X figure and the Steelbook.
It looks like all four figures can connect with each other together.
The stones are the worst lol
The denial in his voice hurts. If you spent 200$ You dont have a reason to be too upset wew boi
I preordered the collectors edition a minute after it went live, then after watching IGN un-box it a month ago I cancelled it.\n\nThey look like a joke! What's worse is the original awesome design photo is on the cover of the box. \nThey couldn't even change the picture on the box to resemble how shit they look.\n\nI upgraded to just the deluxe. Even though I love MvC the game does look shit in comparison to UMvC3 but this is honestly the worst collectors edition flop I've ever seen.
Lmao wtf those infinity stones
So glad i prefer to spend my money into more comics. At least are much better than this piece of useless TRASH!
X's eyes look stupid and the figures look like large shity amibos. I don't like the Infinity Gem set, thank jebus I cancelled my order.
The game looks better than those infinity stone and those stones look better than chun li's face before the patch. smh
Holy shit that looks horrible I was thinking of getting the ce but changed to destiny 2 and assassins creed thank gosh I wasn't dumb I knew something wasn't right with this one
are you sure it is sold 200$ in the USA ??? cos for once we got a better deal in EU... in France i preordered mine and got it for 109€ .... weird gap ....
The infinity stones look nothing like the actual stones, they could've at least made them more realistic, but why were they so lazy to make the stones  look cheap and tacky
Don't blame Capcom for this crap, blame Marvel they only want their movie characters in the games. They wanted people getting hyped for the infinity stones because of the upcoming movies will feature them. But you can't make great games based too much on movie content so blame Marvel for making this game series crappy.
Rainbow Bands are from the rainbow road on X-Guard
Didn't know Mr Krabs got into the gaming business, those infinity stones look like shit.
I'm happy this CE only cost me $71 from Best Buy. After seeing what was shown here vs official images, the quality is not what I'd expected. Oh well, nice addition to the collection for about the cost of a new game.
I wonder if those Infinity Eggs has something inside.
Watching this video reminds me of the 40 year old Virgins apartment.
canceling pre order mine after see this lol
How much gb doses it have
Those stones look terrible ! what a rip off lol , so happy I didn't buy this collectors edition , For $200 the people who bought this should get Season 1 and season 2 of DLC for free . The stones just look like cheap plastic Easter eggs , Nothing like how they were advertised,Here is a comparison Image. https://i.imgur.com/2HE0HxB.jpg
When you gonna do a livestream Mr. Ketchum? Derrick's cornering the market.
Lol talk about false advertisement, those stones look like ass
Carlton: Still playing with dolls will?\n\nWill:  ACTION FIGURE, ACTION FIGURE
i wonder if i can find that mega man seperate. cuz its the only good thing here
I only came here for X\nam dissapoint
Cant wait for this to come out too excited infinity eggs are a meh but the rest is good
The figures look cool. The rest is meh, Capcom dropped the ball yet again.
in the UK with retailer GAME they're doing the collector's edition, but not just any collector's edition. You've got the choice of the standard collector's or the deluxe collector's. With the standard £155 you get the statues and the game (no steelbook), and that's it. Deluxe collector's you get everything you're supposed to get with the collector's, statues, steelbook, all the DLC for £185. You'd think if you looking for a collector's edition it'd be just the one and also, if you're paying £155 you'd think you'd get everything. Plus I've seen in America, when convert dollars to pounds it's £150. Fuck GAME.
So much negativity.  I am excited.  Reply if you got ps4 I'll add u we can play
why are you using a butcher knife to break the tape
I don't really care about this game or anything in the collectors edition, Except for X!
THAT WAS A REAAALLY BAD UNBOXING VIDEO, you can see he doesnt have any experience doing those haha, just the way he opened the thing that had the figures x_x
I cancelled my edition bc those infinity stones are so ugly!
The camera placement for this vid is not great.  Honestly I'm with most of you, the case and the stones look so cheap even with 20% off on Best Buy it isn't worth it.
Wooow that's fucking bad. I saw pics on twitter but they look even worse in the video.
4:16 What the hell? Is that a sound effect added in?
I pity the poor saps who got the collectors edition.
Yeah this is bull I’m about to cancel my CE May keep it but this is BS, I guess the statues are worth it tho....
It's because the color bands on the base are the Asgard stage and it's on the road to Asgard which is normally a bridge, a rainbow bridge specifically but since X's world has fused with Thor's home world thanks to Ultron Sigma well it looks more like a highway road and not a total rainbow bridge
Why did they use chun li? You would think they would give you ryu since the first trailer was iron man mega man captain marvel and ryu.
thats bull crap yall get that for free jesus
So they know that X exist but they will not give us a new megaman x game. uhh silly silly capcom
You just saved me 200+ bucks so glad I seen this before the game came out. I already canceled my pre-order. as thanks I will sub to you guys.
The figures actually look pretty good, which is suprising considering everything else about this game.
ill buy this once the x-men are added in.. or if Captain Commando, Jin, Hayato, and Amingo come as dlc
Like the figures.... not the stones.. You cant even take them out the case.... going to cancel my pre-order. Not really worth it in my opinion.
Those are the street roads in the game that's why it's cold that way in those  infinity stones probably look cheap but when they light up they probably will have lines coming out of them making them look like stone   And I'm going to definitely   Pick up mine but it's too bad wolverine  X 23 iron in the game I guess that's what happens when Disney owns a lyses they ruined everything
Bro it was this special edition sucks. Infinite is garbage compared to the rest. Huge disappointment to me.
so the toys are cheap as the game? yeap Capcom.
i work and make my own money and i bought this. i think the stone are neat. theyre not what they looked like in the release info, but still okay. i just like collectables. judge me if you will.
The rainbow bands on the ground are part of the rainbow bridge to asgard, which if you notice on that stage the city half of the stage is taken from the first level of Megaman X. Thought that'd make you even happier about your purchase man. I'll be receiving mine in a few days:)
I reserved this bundle and going to pay $172.
It's killing me that he didn't place X next to Chun Li and Iron Man next to Captain Marvel so it looks like a 2v2 fight
I think the colorful bands are from the rainbow road in the game.
Its So Stupid That People Are Buying MVC4 Knowing They're Not Happy With The Roster
Funny how months before the game came out multiple dlc characters were announced (including characters in the story mode like one of the main bad guys as dlc...). \n\nThe roster is at its all time worst at 30 characters with no x-men or really many highly requested characters like Wesker or captain commando, but given trash characters like Spencer or firebrand, yet they're gonna charge us... $30 USD for 6 dlc characters that were already in the game files? (In the big leak venom, winter soldier, monster hunter and obviously black panther/sigma were shown to have files in a build of mvci)
Stop the hate DBFZ fanboys!!!!\n\nYou don't like MARVEL vs. CAPCOM?\nfine, leave the fans alone idiots. Stop gloating about DBFZ. I'm sick and tired of every MARVEL vs. CAPCOM having DBFZ fanboys trashing.\n\nYou fanboys think that DBFZ is the center of attention. But its not.\n\nYou guys like to gloat?\nWell... I'm a dbz fan but I'm not interesting in it. I'm interested in MARVEL vs. CAPCOM: INFINITE.\n\nSo stop it right now!!!!
2:03 WARNING! There is a Maverick inside!
What is up with those Infinity eggs they look nothing like the box art!\nExpectations: Crystal clear translucent looking stones\nReality: Poorly painted easter eggs.
Isn't this false advertising? Can't you sue for this kind of thing
These toys look like the ones you get on a happy meal lol good thing i canceled my pre order on this shit i knew it was not worth $200
The one I'm personally least interested in is Captain Marvel\nUh oh. Better watch out that those Disney lawyers don't flag your video! :D
the figures look cheap but pretty well detailed. nothing  like RE5 snow globe level bullshit. the infinity stones however look like fucking dollar store plastic easter eggs
It's the dark souls estus flask all over again
Oh right, this game is coming out. Forgot about it due to the poor roster.
Fix the description. It's not Mega Man, it's Mega Man X. How dare you get that wrong. Unsubscribed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeriously though, fix it.
Those are literally plastic easter eggs from AliExpress or GearBeast or some shit with cheap LEDs lodged under them. This brings a whole new meaning to I'm gonna take you for a ride.
Figures look OK. Stones look bad. Roster looks meh. Mechanics look fun. I have no idea how to feel about this.
Wait what? The stone looks different....  The figures doesn't look good either. I've seen better figures. Not worth for $140 for figures.($140 figures + $60 games) Glad I downgrade to standard. I hope the game is good. 4 days left. \nThanks you for the video.
I wonder how many of these editions they sent to GameStop. I bet all those unsold boxes are taking up so much room.\n\nSpeedy Diver is gonna have a blast finding these.
There's a lot in there It better be, this thing costs 200 dollars
2 hundred dollars? Suckers only!
Got 'em
Wow....\n\nGreat statues and Infinty Easter Eggs....
Looks super cheap LMAOOO
Aha hahaha hahaha fucking capcom
wow, how much this crap cost?
cheap stuff
DOLLAR STORE EASTER EGGS
ahahahhahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Easter came early
Sorry Carol Danvers fans\n\nHA! What fans?
Garbage
Why do you guys buy trash?
Uuhhh... uhhh... uhhh...
#InfinityEggs
LOL at morons who buy this garbage
😂😂😂
The silly children in the comments section failed to notice that the Collector's edition includes the season pass that comes with 6 characters. How laughable, especially the illegitimate criticism this game is facing that has no objective leg to stand on.
Xmen? No okay bye
Was it worth it?
This is retarted why chui li it shouldve been ryu and megaman
Man, this is awful.
Remember everything that made Back to the Shack and the White Album great?\n\nNeither does Rivers.
Here before it gets viral
0:53 Lyrics in the description are wrong, my god, so unprofessional.
Much better than the last two singles in my opinion!
Great collage/design work. I love the west coast/beach/sunny-fun iconography.
Weezer sound like they've been listening to Hard-Fi
All I can think of is the Surfer God episode of China, IL
not a good song.. idk why singers i like say they like weezer
This doesn't even sound like The Beach Boys! :(
1st listen - no likey!\n2nd listen - LOVE\n\n#thatsweezer
woah. I'm the 100 thousandth viewer. neet.
Last few songs have been okay but after the White Album my expectations were really high!! So far I'm slightly disappointed...
WOW!
let me just say this for everyone SHUT UP AND ENJOY THE SONG!
Makes a rainy day shine.
This is an insult to Weezer and The Beach Boys
jesus christ the lyrics.
This song has no soul
LOVE THE NEW SONG, I WANT THE ALBUM NOW!
It's growing on me...
N o T h a n k Y o u . . . . .
Beach Boys = Pacific Nightmare.   Turn it down.....
This is fully awful and it's all the more painful off the back of how amazing White Album was.
They should leave the beach music to the Beach Boys
Walking with the Mexicans \nShould I call an ambulance\n\nReally, Rivers? \n\n\n\n\nBecause I would would have called ICE
Oh!  First single since they started that I haven't instantly liked. Hopefully grow on me\n.
Well that was awful.
I feel like I'm in an abusive relationship with Weezer. They made me fall in love with them for 7 years then they started beating me. They'd apologize and buy me flowers and I'd believe them...until the next album when they pushed me down the stairs. And I'd keep coming home to them. And they would apologize, and I'd take them back. This time though, I'm finally packing and leaving. It's been a long 24 years, but all good things come to an end.
This song is awful! What happened?
My first ever hit of The Beach Boys. Combined with a werewolf. What's not to love?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeVEbbheUck
I was hoping it would sound like the Beach Boys - like Surf Wax America sort of did....
ugh...make believe had like three good songs on it...after that--it's just sad. sorry.
RIP the time you could say new Weezer is as good as their old stuff 2014-2016
This is the same band that made Everything Will Be Alright in the end 3 years ago? \nDisappointed...
Its a bit like raditude
How do you go from white to this in 1 year?\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to disagree
Rivers does it again.
I wasn't even born when The Blue Album and Pinkerton came out, but I'm still hoping for another Pinkerton. That is the greatest album to one of my favorite bands that I've ever listened to. I can relate to each song perfectly. These new songs are too much like every other song playing nowadays, no real instruments or deep lyrics. Just random noises and lyrics put together into random places. I want the Weezer with the guitar solos and Rivers' personal lyrics. It's a lot more relatable than the music they're making now. I'll always support them, but I wish they'd go back to the good music.
it's not terrible
Well, I like it. Turn it up, it's weezer!
My eyes get moist with your tribute song!!!
how you gonna make a song called beach boys without sick harmonies
it's alright. i guess.
I don't understand the comments praising this song. I love Weezer to death but as soon I clicked the play button I felt my life force being drained by how utterly boring and predictable this song is. Not to mention some of these lyrics, christ.
I like the Beach Boys sounding part in the second part of the chorus.
So after two decent rock records were back at Ratitude. DAMN YOU Weezer.
ughhh. Foo fighters and Mastodon release awesome albums and Weezer release this. Forget this and go listen to Mastodons new EP; its epic.
Everytime I think Weezer can't come up with a more cringeworthy chorus than Beverly Hills, they release a new song and I realize it's been going downward for more than a decade now. I mean, seriously? Turn it up, it's the Beach Boys? Jesus Christ. So bad. Well, there will always be Blue, Pinkerton, and Green for me.\n\nP.S.: Yes, White had some good moments. That's it though.
I can't believe ... Why they released a song in 2014 saying I forgot that disco sucks ??? It is all lie... Unfortunatelly, I have concluded that =w= is a fake band... they made blue and pinkerton because grunge at that time was yet strong... if disco was strong  at that time, there would not be blue nor pinkenton, but raditude and things like that... sad to say that, but it is true...
Rivers is trolling us all again
It's different, I like it
Would like old Weezer sound to come back tbh
TURN IT UP, IT'S THE BEACH BOOOYS\n\nMost obnoxious chorus Weezer has made in a while.
This is chill... I love it
The verses have nothing to do with The Beach Boys.
Verse makes up for the chorus, honestly not a bad song, just give it a second listen.
The chorus, to me, is an nice and interesting little tribute. And did any of you catch a couple small Murry Wilson interludes (obviously reenacted)? I did and noticed them right away at first listen. (Murry was the father of the Beach Boys' Brian, Carl, and Dennis Wilson.)
The chorus is like an anti-commercial. If The Beach Boys weren't already one of my favorite bands ever, I would've been turned off from them forever.\n\nBut regardless, the verses and bridge are nice, and I'll still be crankin' dem Beach Boys at the end of the day.
it's a hip hop world\n\njust kill me
This isn't bad, it's just bland, it's so mediocre, it's plain old pop. If I wasn't told it was Weezer I wouldn't know it was them. I'm not asking for another Pinkerton, so tired of people saying that, but even Maladroit and stuff from Red blows this away. I'll take Miss Sweeney or Burndt Jamb over this any day.
Wood wee I dress just like The Beach Boys
While this isn't the greatest song Weezer has ever released, there is no denying this is catchy af.
As a single, yeah, this is weak. Moist makes me uncomfortable. But this is the same band that at one point put out Pinkerton. So like, maybe the uncomfort is intentional?
Man. He's really figured out how to make efficient and catchy songs.
Very cool song! Show the Beach Boys some (Mike) love... they helped pioneer Americana rock and got kicked (unfairly) into the nostalgia circuit - for what, not playing for some pot head hippies at Monterey? - despite their 50+ years of recording and touring. Summer's (not!) Gone :)
This track is big step backwards for weezer specially when you look at the quality that was EWBAITE and white.
It is a hip hop world isn't it weezer
I love Weezer, I love summer, but why do they only make music for this season??
This is just really disappointing, their last 3 singles have all been bad!
Good. Not as good as Feels Like Summer which is excellent but much better than Mexican Fender which is a bit throwaway. New album will probably be OK but I loved White so will probably feel a little let down. We'll see I guess!
THIS IS FANTASTIC!!!  What an excellent chorus - a real cool ode to Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys!!!  Sweet tune!  Thanks Weezer!!
I get some rhcp vibes with the guitar.
I cant wait for the official acoustic version of this
Sounds like India.
GETCHOO GETCHOO GETCHOO GETCHOO GETCHOO GETCHOO GETCHOO GETCHOO GETCHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOO\nUHUHUHHHHHH GETCHOOOOOOOO\n\nlove the lyrics
This album is gonna suck.
=w=
ugh
love it!
Cancer
U H
Weezer brought me here
HOLY HECK YES
BOP
Much.  Better
weezer はスゴイですね。
Here at 46k
Mexican fender was alright, but this.. Idk.
Genius!
Radi2de?
Love love love it!
NEVER FORGET PINKERTON
Una de mis bandas favorita haciendo una cancion sobre otra de mis bandas favoritas, son lo mejor!! los amooooo, y a los beach boys tambien <3<3
Why is weezer bad now?
Hate to say it but it's looking like this is the first Weezer album I pass on, absolutely terrible! !!!!

Not once have i ever heard a Weezer song one time, I refuse to ever listen to this garbage again, fucking awful,
If Weezer is looking to gain new, younger fans, this is not how to do it. I'm a fairly new fan of Weezer, I jumped on the train with the white album, and have since gone through their discography. Their first two releases and the white album are all stellar to me. Why, WHY are they so insistent on pandering to a radio-audience?
It grows on you, but the lyrics are still weird. Makin' my eyes get moist.
Hello world! I'm an upcoming music artist can you guys listen to my music and show support thanks.

LMAO I went to korea over break to visit relatives and this basically happened to me lol... I just keep saying nae which means yes in korean lol
This is just me in my own language

I'm a Korean
I'm korean and this pretty much sums it up.
Me when my Portuguese grandparents call. I always just make up an excuse like, Uh me go to bathroom bye then throw the phone at my mom and run away
I will sub back to EVERYONE who subs to me and comments when done
me in a nutshell when i went to japan (im half japanese)
Growing up in a english speaking country, this has to be the most relatable video I have seen as a korean lmao
Sub to me and I'll sub back
That Was Hilarious Gun..Face..F**k Lol!! 😂
me when I meet other Germans and I'm like lol guten tag and they begin reciting German Satan rituals and I'm just sitting there and all I can understand is hello
This is like me with Vietnamese. I can understand it perfectly but whenever i open my mouth to speak it english words are coming out 😂
Me when Im on the phone with my korean grandparents
When my relatives are over, i go to school acting like a thug just like them.
THIS IS MEEEEEEEEE(but I like slightly whiter ;-; white people suck)
that ending...FUCK\nmade my day\n\nthank you
God, this is me with Polish. D: Lol
Accurate
I swear if you had a vine you would've had millions of followers.
As a tourist in Japan my go to words were:1. SUMIMAscuse me!2.GOMENnosorry!
This happened to me once.  I told this lady  that I was learning Japanese and she was like Great, show me what you know So I greeted her in Japanese and she responded with stuff (IDK WTF SHE WAS SAYING ) And she stood there waiting for me to respond so I was just like Yes and she started laughing because all she said was What are you going today?
My Mother told me I can't get 1000 Subs in 5 days ... Can We Prove her wrong

This is so me when I try to speak spanish with my family
Gun... Face... Fuck\n*just straight up run away in 3 2*
Considering how many people are born and raised outside of their native countries these days; I'd say this is all too relatable and it's obvious why it hit the front page :P
Going to South Korea anytime soon? Would love to see that.
This is me at Mexican parties
It's been shown that typically your native language is lost within 3 generations if you live in another country. I hate how ignorant my relatives and parents are. If you primarily speak English in public for 15 plus years youre gonna lose your language a bit no shit. I mean that's the whole idea of school isnt it. Now on the other hand in can still speak and understand my native tongue but i dont diss on people who can't because I understand its only bound it happen.
ASL in a nutshell. You're supposed to sign with a lot of Deaf people to get better, but dammit when their hands are a blur and you're just standing there, regretting your life decisions, it SUCKS\n\n\nAND YOU CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER THE SIGN FOR SORRY
this is me and Telegu. i have no goddamn clue how to speak it.
This is me with my family. Can't speak spanish well.
Me 😂 Shit, These are the conversations with my grandma
Me when I visit my Vietnamese family
YouTube sure does like this guy

Why does this guy sound like Brian from Family guy
You guys are lucky that their are a lot of people who can speak Korean. There aren't many people who can speak my native tongue.
gotta try to teach my kid a bit mandarin...or Cantonese...or whatever my parents can understand...
this has to break a record for the most views per seconds
giving a spanish speaking tourist direction to the subway station in new york city, which im hoping he understood.
This is every conversation I had with my 8th grade French teacher
Oh it’s wayyyyyyy harder for me cause both of my parents are from different states in India and mostly every state has a different language and they both sound very similar so it’s sooo awkward when I mix up the words with my family
When your french teacher asked a question you didn't understand and reply with with a 'oui'
😂😂😂😂 I know. I been in America long time....#sad
So, I'm 1/8th German, but my family left their homeland over 200 years ago, and just married other Germans for like, 150 years.  No one in my family speaks German, but we all look very German.  So when I went to Berlin, people kept asking for directions, and I'm just like o_o
Is this Kim Jong un's younger brother?

Hi Jemma. I am a huge fan, (as well as everyone in my office, my partner and friends, as they get to eat everything I bake) and look forward to your weekly recipes.\nI am coming to London next week and a main place to visit is Crumbs and Doilies. Is it easy to find? And do you work there so I can say hello?. This year I applied for the Australian version of The bake off and just missed out on being on the show as I was number 13 of 12. \nYou are a great inspiration and have learnt so much from your videos.  Don (Melbourne)
OMG!!!!\nLove everything you do. \nKisses from Azores Portugal
앞머리봐~ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 머리동그랗고 귀엽다 스다듬고싶네ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ외모는 뷰티여자들보다 반은못미치네
I'm a trainee pastry chef, and my job each morning is to toast the tops of lemon meringue tarts. I WANT TO EAT THEM ALL BUT CAN'T!
I would've come but you know.... different continent and stuff. Wish I could have been there though
Jemma is it possible that your brownie recipe can become the crust for a blueberry cheesecake?\n\nIf its possible can you teach me how? <3
dear Jemma I'm a HUGE fan and always make an effort to go to crumbs and doilies when in London because I'm from Birmingham but sadly I'm in year 6 at school so if by any chance you could try and o it on a weekend I would be honoured to meet you in person if not no probs and I hope it goes perfectly for you \na GINORMOUS cupcake Jemma fan:)
Thought the announcement would be you were engaged hence the beautiful ring on your finger ...
Hi jemma how are you! Hope you doing well this is minhaz from botswana which is in the continent africa, i looooovvvveee ur recipes so much and they always come out amazing, i use your lemon curd recipe all the time and i also tried your doughnuts, they were so good. Could you please share a recipe on how to make a rose and pistachio cake or cupcakes . Thank you
Can you use a multiple ring tin with removable bottoms?
Awwww man, I'm in the USA, can't get there 😂
In July I visited your shop and it was honestly such a highlight of my trip overseas. I bought your book and I have been baking from it since I got back 😊 my pick at the moment is the  cardamom, lime and pistachio cake! Can't wait till I get to visit your shop again ...love from Australia 🐨🐨
i think the mixer broke

Can any kind soul advise on the longevity of the Italian Meringues? Like, how long can it be left in the open/airtight container? I've read somewhere that advised against chilling it as it adds moisture. Thanks in advance!
Cannot hear mention of a baked alaska without thinking of that one GBBO episode ...
I'll just swim across the canal than, kisses from Belgium

This looks absolutely divine!! Why can't there be a CDS in Connecticut! :(  how delicious is this! Im craving it so much lol
Burnt marshmallows are the best smell ever.

Wish you make your square cake one Thursday xx
The one week I leave london this whole summer... Guess we're cutting this trip short.
Hi Jemma. Can you store those in the freezer for a couple hours before serving or does the meringue crumble/fall together in the cold?
I enjoyed your background music today.
Can you do a French or Italian macarons recepie
Wish I could come on Monday, don't even live that far but it's GCSE year and I've got tuition so I can't make it 😭😭😭

These look soooo tasty! Thank you for sharing! What vanilla extract do you use?? It looks amazing!
Too bad I live in Nova Scotia, 'cause I'd be there to eat one of those delicious looking creations if I could! Yummy! Guess I'll just have to make it myself
Hey jemma i was in your shop yesterday but you weren't there and i had a salted caramel cupcake and it was amazing!!!💖💖 i do wish you were there though😯

Please can you do a French or Italian macaron recipe video?
Your jacket is making me cringe hard
If you wanted to make these for a party, how much could you do ahead ? Can you do it all and keep it refrigerated?
If we don't have blowtorches is there an alternative
You mentioned not having access to graham crackers, why is that? Do they not have them where you are? I'm from the U.S.
Can anyone say what kind of Standmixer she uses?
That Cupcake Jemma apron behind you is so pretty!

With the oil diesel gas companies, we will never see cars to move with water because of the ELITE . By the way i like when ELITE say stop the polution of the earth , but they don't let the people with knowlege to give the technologie to produce cars that use water to move. So the ELITE think we are idiots, but they don't know, that we know friendly enviroment ways to use vehicles, and that means we are not idiots, we just pretend we don't know nothing. So tomorrow again let's fill up with gasoline in our car's and keep up the polution of the earth. Funny story ha ?
Why the fuck was there a car PARKED in front of the run?\nThat is so fucking stupid in so many ways. Idiots.
Would no it be better use air, instead water? Because air is more compressible.How much is the pressure to put the water on cylinders?

No autotune regular voice that's talent
Very cool...you can tell he is doing this without any back up and they added the music and backing track later
I love the hand motions, like he's ready to throw down, this song is so powerful. :D
i just listen to it in my head and just wish it was actually was on right then
Just spent the first half of this video thinking it was in silence before I realise my headphone had fallen out of my ear 😂😂😂 xx
This song is utter genius. I am stupefied.
HOT DAMN!!!
Amazing!!!!
Those vocals are god-like
melody to my ears
Another banger from XAmbassadors...
eu hein.

Way to keep it real! If we can't love artists for their real music, then what's the point? Thank you for an awesome song and video!
I'm in love with this masterpiece ❤
SO awesome!! Cant wait to see these guys in concert
Now this is a song that I would like to hear instead of Despacito and other meaningless songs. IDK if you know this or not but they used live vocals for this video. It means that he is really singing the song in this music video which is the reason why it sound so pure and unique. X ambassadors all the way *thumbs up*
Love this song!! Awesome video too!!
best type of song out there. i can think of x ambassadors, kodaline, the lumineers..nice music, meaningful lyrics, moving emotions..i can repeat them all day long all night long..and keep in mind..he sang live in this video!!
Everybody should sing in street like that sometimes, so cool !
I am obsessed with X-ambassadors!
DAAAMN!!! HIs singing LIVE the whole video!!! Thats TALENT right there!!! MAD RESPECT!!!
I love this! Dude can sang!
WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK ARE THOSE VOCALS?!?!?!?! Daaammmn!!! (I don't usually swear but there are some exceptions in life)
I am in awe! This is ground breaking.
I thought I was going to win the 1million dollar jackpot,it turns out I was far ahead of myself

Can anyone explain what the two people who were following implied?
Who was here before 1 million?
I still can't believe I'm watching a music video for Lift. I thought that this would never happen.
Thom is a ghost who is stuck in a lift!
Can't tell if Thom Yorke or Thoros of Myr...
Makes me think about Dr. House, the video and the song.\n\nI don't know why
This viddeoclip, next to the lyrics of the song, seems to be a metaphor of life ... dont you think?
I thougt that de thumbnail was something from gary's mod
The end scene reminds me of the scene when Patrick Star wearing gorilla custome
they are totally going back to the bends era... hell yeah
Who else noticed that the number on the lift at 13 also went upside down and when he got to floor 01 it changed to OK very briefly.
This was made in 1996 I knew it sounded to good to be made today.
Love this Pablo Honey's vibe you put into this song :)
Just take the stairs.
His soul is stuck in a lift
I want that jacket so bad
DMT trip in the lift
third floor is from her morning elegance?
God how i love this guys
Bunhead - Elevator
975 son de coldplay...
minute 1:26
nice jacket
Excellent video.
2:52 OMG is Robin from Paranoid Android
Mate what
Thom is the antagonist of the rockstar cliché
Felt like the winter soldier when all the business men came in the elevator.
good song. gentle but strong sound.
this is video art and the song is just 'elevator' music
3:34\nThe 01 on display above doors flashes and shows OK :)
if the gates of hell is an elevator door and the guy who would meet me inside is thom yorke, i would not hesitate to get inside.
What building is this?
he lives in that elevator
Been my favourite song for a few years now :)
I applaud the director for making a video we haven't seen before and not obstructing the serenity of the song.
This song is an aural piece of sheer magic for my ears, lol! So catchy and cool!
Did you notice the OK reference in the lift numbers when it reached the 01? \nThe album was going to be named zeroes and ones before being OK computer...
Even better, we had it when we're 40.
So basically, take the stairs.

1:39 One of the men,  were Phil Selway.
radiohead is the best band  :)
I love you Radiohead.
I really love how this video looks like from the 90's or early 2000's , I was born in 1999 and i'm about to turn 18, I'm young but I prefer old classic rock music, instead of what today's people call music they don't know nothing.  I wish that people who lived teenhood during the 80's or 90's knew how lucky they are,  let's keep rock music alive everyone!
Radiohead is always good.  I was needed to hear this... thank you Radiohead. With love from Brazil. ♥
Radiohead and Hans Zimmer are working together on a track!
Did Thom do his own stunts for this?
He ain't in a lift, he's in a limousine. Lol
What about people whose eyes are glued to a little screen?
I DONT GET IT
Wow
In the belly of a whale .......
The kid from paranoid android made my fucking day
I love the way camera shakes at the end it's so befitting
Is that Flo from the Progressive adverts @ 3:26?
That Building were to dammit tall
Notice how the elevators changes to OK for a sec when he gets to the number 01
Who is the guy in the torn dirty clothes
This song is so beautiful. I NEVER WRITE COMMENTS. BUT FUCK this song is very pretty. *sighs*
Ok so as I can gather from the comments, this video has a lot of references to other radiohead's videos: the old man is the karma police dude, one of the girls in the beginning is picking a fake plastic tree, there's the guy from the paranoid android video, the dancers are from the street spirit video, the kid is from high and dry.\nI think  the video might be about thom going through different stages of radiohead's career. It makes sense too because the other two last videos, as some people in the comments pointed out, are about a paranoid guy (man of war) and an android (I promise). So, being oknotok a retrospective, it makes sense that this video, as were the other, is a reference to the past.\nIf anyone finds other references, please share!
It is math related to science?
next tour in bolivia
Such a common denominator and the best way of the way is the fact of course the best of all of predictive text got the best of this post.
2:54 i see the guy with the purple beanie hat and green sweater from paranoid android video drinking from a fishbowl
this looks like something roy andersson would make
very nice
I like it very much
note that he is going down. maybe he is symbolically coming down to earth.
Nice.
I love the references to other music videos. Love letter to the fans.
Do not show shock, when things are upside down. Everything nowadays is upside down. Everything wrong, is OK. Everything right? Is merely in the mind of 'crazy' people. Those conspiracy theories.... Only idiots believe! Keep looking down at your phones people, do not look to the skies. Keep yourself in a bubble of daily chores and entertainment, never look beyond that.\nIt's like the beginning of train spotters. Irvin Welsh knew a lot and it's in his books for those with the eyes to see... When your eyes open slightly you can delve into meatier stuff. \nPlease recognise. Please communicate. We are all in this together.\nThis video gives you a glimpse... Follow. (These are my opinions. Love you)
Turkey 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
Ahh 💗
Hi
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Reminds me of Smashing Pumpkins
💕
If you loo at the floor number once it gets to floor 01 it flickers and changes to 'OK'
Love it!! Best band of musical philanthropists ever!!
Vocals in this are very OK Computer-y
Ironically, my favourite non-album song by Radiohead is Staircase... I'll always take the Staircase over the Lift.
Roblox the normal elevator boys.
90s radiohead is back
I wasn't reasy
awesome!!!!
Thanks Radiohead
Remember Pablo Honey
sounds like the bends
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeddddddddd
Fucking awesome I love Radiohead.
genious
After Being John Malkovich : Being Thom Yorke
OHMUHGODFINALLY
3:59 *whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat???????just was, that, ugh what, ummmmm okay....???*
Radiohead never disappoints man ;_;
Hey guys! My name is Malik Charles...im really tryna get my music heard and would appreciate any support! I make music about love,life,pain and try my best to reach all people. Please take a listen... https://youtu.be/JXZgl62f0dA
Oh I bet it's a lift to occupied and colonized territories of Palestine
So overrated
the idea of this video is taken from russian band time machine
why he got plastic bags instead of re-useabe shopping bags?
Youtube must have a 'loop' option, so I can listen to this over and over again all day long.
OMG. YOU LIKE KINGDOM HEARTS. To be honest that isn't suprising
I think a theory about evil Morty would be great since we have more info about him.
Do a aliens theory
He didn't mention the Hercules animated series, which had its own version of Triton. I doubt Triton from The Little Mermaid is the same since the animated series version had GREEN SKIN AND PURPLE HAIR. Why does no one mention this?
Yeah, because this theory hasn't been presented a couple dozen times on YouTube and reddit.
He has a book => it's about he's family
Maybe mat pat could do an IT theory???
Now tie in Bambi and 101 Dalmatins- good luck.
Can we have an It theory?
MatPat, do you think you could do a theory on the following?: Do Ruby and Sapphire from Steven Universe have an unhealthy relationship?
I love connected universes! Very fun to think about! Like Marvel and Pixar. Can't wait for more MatPat!
Best Disney movie is Lilo and Stitch!
but if Poseidon had triton and Zeus had Hercules, that means triton and Hercules are cousins, there for Ariel is Hercules 2nd cousin.
i like star wars cause its Disney now
as a classics major talking about disney mythology and how inaccurate it is hurts me deep....also Rapunzle's hair would be tied back to APOLLO the god of HEALING and not hercules
do a film theor of what is snuffleupagus that wooly mammoth elephant hybrid
Sleeping Beauty do you want on Sleeping Beauty the Grimm's version
Well, it's simple, there is an easy way to connect the two. Hercules is son of Zeus, brother of Poseidon, father of a merman called... \nTriton. Supposedly Ariels father. Simple.
Also Peter Pan is connect to Ariel, don't forget.
Greek term of Hercules: HERAcles, because of HERA
Treasure Planet is my favorite
This is pretty cool but I just think these are Easter eggs but still this was super cool and you can tell how much time was put into this. Luv yah Matt
Also mat to let you know Poseidon is the god of earthquakes horses and the water just to let you know
Imma just  wing this before watching the video: \n-Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon are brothers\n-Zeus is Hercules's dad\n-Poseidon is Ariel's dad\nshamwow theory made you can go home now\n\nEDIT: I was close ://
What about a theory about Friday the 13th
2:08 The theory starts here. Thank me later. ;D
who else didnt expect the kingdom hearts reference also why didnt he call sephiroth lance bass since he played sephiroth  in kh1 and i think 2 dont quote me on the kh2 part. anyways good to know my favorite theorist plays my favorite disney game
My favorite Disney movie is Cinderella
1:19 sounds like he's saying the N Word
Did you Elsa and Tangled have a brother is a Disney movie called Tarzan just watch the whole movie
statring at 0:54 Light's hair from Deathnote, then Digimon, then Charlie brown Christmas sounding music... \n\nWhy do I notice all of this? why do I have no life? \n\nFind out next time, on __________Z
In the little mermaid musical they make it like a thing to let you know Ariel's grandfather is posideon.
You should call this disney family
Do a theory on how the characters of Dragon Ball Z should be (close to) deaf because of how fast Goku moves (the speed of light) and what happens during the show like all the destruction during fights.
I like how you made the Poseidon and Triton connection in this video, but I wish you proved that Triton was that Triton by bringing historical and mythological evidence.
The last little mermaid movie explains who mom was and how she died.
Or... Or... counter theory. They like putting Ester eggs in their movies for fun observant users. Also if this annoying lil boy asks me to subscribe again when I subscribed 2 years ago I'll just unsubscribe
Do a theory on how rick is alive at his age with his excessive drinking.(rick and morty)
clap you linked Hercules to frozen good job
I was eating while watching and\ndecided to stab it with my fork, I destroyed my phone screen, typing this on my computer
This is why Greek has no economy but still exists
*stops caring after Cappy's appearance, cause thats the only thing that matters to me*
... ok not to be rude, but this is just bothering me. Out of Homer's only two known stories, in one of them, Heracles (Hercules) is DEAD. So Cinderella most likely happened after Heracles died, and probably a while after, but him and Ariel are only a generation apart. I'm not saying it's COMPLETELY impossible for  them to be linked, but to me it just seems unlikely. Also, I seriously doubt Matpat would purposefully steal ideas from another creator, but I'm pretty sure Super Carlin Brothers set the foundation for this idea a LONG time ago. Maybe I'm wrong, but I've definitely seen this fact before. Of course, they didn't put as much work into it as Matpat did though :)
Make an it theory
Greek mythology in a nutshell:\nZeus: Imma go put my dick in it!\nEveryone else: No don't do it!\nZeus: Too late!
I love Greek mythology. Like am in love with it
Plz everyone if u want mat pat to do a theory about this than plz like
love your videos could you do one on where sleeping beauty is from?
The Princess and the frog also moana
*Niggle niggle* -Matpat 2017 (yes I just quoted him on that, Matpat's word is law [*faint whisper* not really])
I think you are cool😊😎😎
Soooooo I wanna know how Snow White is connected.
Wait a second.\nThe trident of Neptune (Poseidon) was in a Pirates movie.  \nYOU DON'T SUPPOSE?....
Please calculate how much it costs to make a HowToBasic video. How much does it cost to destroy that much furniture, buy that many eggs, pay whoever cleans it up afterwards, and to repair the building?
(Is no one going to mention the fact that the Tarzan being Elsa and Anna's younger brother theory was confirmed to be canon?)
I like frozen.... it has magic
Anna from frozen is related to Tarzan because after her parents boat sinks the end up on that island and give birth to Tarzan then die
hey, MattPatt! I recently watched Disney's Atlantis: the Lost Empire, and it was AWESOME!! anyway, I was hoping you could do an episode on it, because 1) I love it and 2) it's got TONS of great stuff in it. So PLEASE do a film theory on Atlantis: the Lost Empire, 'cause that would awesome!!
My fav Disney movie is actually Hercules. What a coincidence.
fun fact elsa's parents survived and had a boy on an island who became tarzan
THAT WAS A GREAT INTRO
Please do a theory on 'The Space Between Us' did they get the science right?
Honestly, Rapunzel's magic hair probably comes from Apollo. For one thing, that was a special flower related to the sun, and also her magic is healing magic. Apollo's respective domains are the sun and healing.
yea this is gonna be good. ps I plan on makeing a collapsible halo energy sword in the futuer also like if you want me to. ps you wont find any content on my channel related to that. yet.
I bet diseny has been doing this for a Marioplex of yearscand still will
LOVED THE INTRO!!!!😍😍😍😍😍

#MatPatIsAFork
What about Tarzan?
Omg my new favorite channel❤️❤️
Rapunzle is probably related to Apollo. She could be a half blood herself. Ya never know.
Heya..  just a question about your hair... how long did that Brazilian treatment last for????
What shade do you use the laura mercier concealer in?
Loved the makeup you did in this vid - very beautiful. Your skin looks amazing and I'm way jealous. \n\nAnd hey, the negative thing is a shit at times eh. It'll come good again :)\n\nNo blogging, vlogging or anything for us lot while in Italy please. It's you and Rich time only. Take care of you!
Love your vlogs!!!
Hi LiLy can you recommend a good Japanese restaurant in London!!! I always love your vlogs!!!
I've been asked if I was pregnant in 6 different countries.  I feel your pain
Hello, Lily! Maybe I can help, have you tried using an actual corticosteroid on you lips instead of only lip balms? I am allergic to most matte lipsticks, and I used Triamcinolone acetonide (I'm not 100% sure that's how you say it in english), after a few days my lips were not sore anymore, and a while later they were completely back to normal. I applied it on my lips before I went to bed and slept with it, it is not the most comfortable thing in the world, but it really helped, also, I didn't use anything on my lips until it was cured, only the La Roche-Posay Ciclaplast baume B5. I hope you will feel better soon (regarding your lips and all the other things bothering you right now).
I hope you cheer up soon. Life is life..not always Ross. I do think however your remarks about Fenton Beauty was a bit narrow minded. Most of the reviews talk about it being very natural, except for perhaps that megawatt highlighter which you have to buy. If Patrick star can find a shade I am sure something might suite you.
omg time has flown by so quickly, I can't believe your one year anniversary is already coming up! I was also surprised to hear that Jemma has a baby, I feel like you were just talking about her wedding related activities!\n\nI personally enjoy watching your different days. You are human, I don't expect you to be happy and jumpy all the time. In fact, the youtubers that only record those days seem so...fake to me. Just keep vlogging and I'll keep watching :)
Love your nails!!
Please don't feel any pressure to be positive constantly in your videos. I think most of us are quite tired of all those perpetually perky youtubers. It just seems so fake, nobody can be that happy and excited about everything all the time. A bit of moodiness is in fact refreshing.
Too bad nobody told you about this amazing lip balm that we have in Swedish pharmacies, you could have picked it up in Stockholm! It was originally made for the Swedish military to use for your lips, hand and sore feet. And you can even cook with it, too. It's called Försvarets hudsalva (the Military skin salve, pretty much) and you need to try this if / or the next time you come to Sweden :)
Thank you for being real and owning the grumps!  I'm there too.
To get rid of fruit flies you should mix apple cider vinegar with any sugary syrup, a drop of soap and some water. The soap is important to break the surface of the liquid which the flies would otherwise be able to walk on. You will notice that the bottom of your glass will be covered with flies within a couple of hours. I promise.
Lily, your honesty is so refreshing. Don't ever feel the need to apologize or try & justify to viewers why you are feeling a certain way. Lots of us have times when we feel exactly like you, but fortunately we don't have to go through it so publically. That said, a public platform to air how you're feeling is at times a really positive thing for those watching, to know they're not alone. Double edged sword really. I thoroughly enjoyed this vlog. Your curry has got my hungover self today  wishing I could've had Richard's bowl! 😂 Big hugs. X
Lilly I got married 18 months ago and since the day we got married the baby question has been asked continually. 😱\nI also have my own business and I went through the same thing as you. It got to me too, and I had a rant too! \nI learnt to just try and let it go over your head and let the people that think because your married and a certain age you should have a baby think what they want! Xxx
i like it when you are just being yourself...
Aww lily\n I'm sure the only reason most of us wouldn't want to hear you being sad and negative is because we wish you all the best and that you can get back to being happy and positive rather than feeling that way. Not just that we don't want to hear you being sad. But, failing that, it's always better to hear how you are truely feeling so that you can get the support you need and deserve to help you get back to the good place in life! Sometimes life gets us down without any particular reason that we can fix, but it's always a good idea to at least identify that the feeling is a little off because sometimes just saying it out loud can be the first step to feeling better. Anyway, hope you feel better soon. I can't imagine having to work in an industry where your personality is your brand! Feeling out of sorts truely must make that very difficult. But know that I enjoy hearing how you are and what you think of things and always appreciate your honesty. X
I feel the same way with me and my friends, we don't take pictures anymore! Haha we just hang out and chat 😊
Cheer up Buttercup :o)  Sorry you're feeling down, but thank you for sharing and I hope things turn around soon!
Can relate to so much in this vlog. Feeling moany today too. Also feel like I have to buy a pink fluffy cushion (and not sure I really even like them!) I even had a lipstick allergy about the same time you did! I've found the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask pretty good. As well as the original allergy I seem to react to lanolin, which of course is in lots of lip treatments!  And I have puffy hair! lol Keep keeping it real Lily!
Hi Lily, we must be twins because I have also been feeling quite down and overwhelmed of-late, further, I too am suffering from the same chapped/cracked/flaky lip condition for the past few weeks. Good news is that I found a method that helps to heal my lips - I hope you'll find it useful in some ways. :) First off, make sure to avoid using 'active' (i.e. acids) skincare + lip care items around/on your lip area. Your lip area is sensitised atm so you don't want to aggravate it further - instead, I use rosehip oil and sensitive-skin friendly moisturiser on the area. On the lips, especially before I go to bed, I generously coat my lip with an oil-based lip balm (again with no-actives; I used a shea butter based one myself) and then sealing my whole lip surface off with a balm/ointment like Lucas paw paw ointment (good thing these products are colourless otherwise I'd look quite like MirandaSings hahahahaha!!). These steps have really really helped to restore my lip to how it was before, I hope it helps. Last but certainly not least, big hugs to you Lily - this shall pass.... lots of love from Perth, Aus!
I'm so glad you don't hide when you're feeling down (not glad you're down though obvs!) ☺ I think you're really helping your followers by making it a very normal thing and accepting it. Life isn't always rosy but it can sometimes seem like it online! I love your vlogs, they inspire me to be better and to keep pushing through even if I'm feeling down xx
Sorry to hear you've been bummed out lately - I go through periods of that, too. I've also got a fairly public persona (not on YouTube but in real life) and I have to say: don't read the comments. I've been married now for 9 years - I'm 34 - and I get the same senseless and shitty comments from people who think they know how to run your life. I'd say, more often than not, they're probably jealous of you -- they're generally upset that you're failing to follow a prescribed pattern. Those who are most successful in life do not follow a prescribed pattern - do what you do well and put on the blinders!!! XO!!
what nail color do you have on?
I am really sorry you don't feel great Lily. I wish you could be ok soon...not because I don't want to see a moany  video ( I am just using your own words, I don't think you're moany at all, you're just a human being having shitty days) but just because I care about you as I just care about a friend. I know it's a stupid thing because we're obviously not friends but it's the way I feel. So, we're all here to support ❤️ xoxo
Lily , everybody cries\nAnd everybody hurts sometimes xx \nI hope you are feeling inspired and motivated . If not , give yourself a break . Lots of love ❤️🙏
I hate fruit flies and I found that there are reusable fruit flies traps on amazon that you just put apple cider vinegar in it and that is it...
I'm sorry you're feeling so down, Lily. I know things will get better for you, hang in there. I actually enjoyed this video, not because I like that you feel sad, but because it felt like hanging out with a friend, which was kind of comforting after a long day at work. Good for you at calling out the pregnant comments; hope people have the decency to stop.
Actually loved this video Lily. Feeling the same myself today 💕
is that a love island water bottle at 12:34? i'm still in mourning about love island
I think when the social media activity became someones full time job the aspect of pressure, popularity race, obsession of new content might be an issue. But it happend with all of us whatever our job is. It is natural to feel sometimes not in the mood or like being at the crossroads. So don't feel sorry to be at this place at the moment....
I adore you JUST The way you are! JUST be you !!!
*hugs* from an internet friend who also sometimes experiences the sads.
Hi Lily , I rarely comment but wanted to say I love that you are genuinely honest . Love everything you do . Sending you big hugs from Ireland  xx
Lily, maybe you should try lanoli for your dry lips. For example dr. Lipp have lip balm with 100% of lanolin :)
I never comment on videos but I I feel so down and very negative some days and I wonder if I'm depressed but then it goes away the next day! I also told friends at work recently that I'd got some good news (a promotion) and they all said they thought I was going to say I was pregnant!! 🙄🙄 Just age and being with a partner for a long time people always think that's the next step!
Have you considered a break from uploading videos for a while? I'm sure the idea is stressful but you can really recharge and hopefully you'll feel a little bit more like you. Other than your honeymoon,  which you still Preshot videos for, when was the last time you had a real break?  P.s. With it not being as sunny where you live and since you've travelled to do many sunny places recently try a really good vitamin d supplement, it helped me adjust from the Cape Town sunshine to the Irish weather which literally made me sad and lethargic due to lack of sun. Also don't ever apologise for saying how you feel, it's better to be honest than pretend everything is perfect. No-one can live up to perfection.
Lily, I like that you've been really honest about feeling a bit down lately. This is real life and we all go through periods of feeling like we're uninspired or in a rut or lacking motivation, and that's ok. Thanks for keeping it real. I often find in moments like this it's important to grasp on to the things that do bring you joy until you start feeling a shift towards being 'yourself' again. Keep your chin up and I hope you'll feel better about things soon.
Yeah it is REALLY rude it's not nice at all
Hi Lily! You totally have to try Uriage Bariederm for your lips. I've tried averything for my sensitive, ezcema-prone lips and it is THE BEST. Love your videos!
I really appreciate the honesty in this! I'm a total home girl and love being a bit of a slob and taking my time to just be myself and do what I need to do! I think you look great! Homey videos are my favourite! I've watched you for years and love you and Anna's friendship and dynamic! Please tell me there will be another series of the podcast? When you're ready obviously and I really mean it when I say no pressure to continue! Just such interesting guests and I'm a bit nosy too! Take care of yourself and don't feel ashamed about being a bit selfish we all need a break from time to time or we burn out! Hope Mark enjoys the curry! I'm not a prawn fan but it looks delicious! Love Madeleine's recipes! Lamb and Sweet Potato stew is our personal fave and lasts a couple of days! X
Always good to know that one is not alone in feeling negative/under the weather. Some days get the worst out of us. As usual, love your vlogs Lily!
Have you ever tried Clinique all about lips? I find it really soothing when my lips are sore. Totally get you with the pregnancy stuff, I'm constantly getting asked when I'm going to have a baby. It's rude, what if there's a reason i haven't got children?!
For your sore lips i recommend the bariederm balm by uriage! It's amazing for sensitive lips.
Lily I love your videos and watch every single one of them! I love it because of the realness of it whether you're in a negative mood or not. Im not annoyed by it I guess after watching you for years you are like a friend to me talking about everything in life or whinging about stuff which is perfectly normal between friends!
Found your comment on the whys of not commenting that someone looks pregnant to be the most direct, succinct, honest, polite and refreshing one I've seen.  As for feeling down, everyone does at times--whether or not they own it or not.  Love the honesty!
I'm one of your older fans (36), and I loved this video. I went through a 4 month period of feeling off and down and I'm finally coming out of it. Good luck! I felt a little lost so if you're feeling that way, I hope you find yourself and discover how to be good with life.
What nail polish are you wearing in this video? It looks great on you.
Thanks for keeping it real. It's a part of life to have highs and lows, it's great that you don't completely hide it all away. I'd much rather see an honest vlog than a fake one. Hope your days get brighter again soon.x
I don't normally comment but just wanted to say thank you for being honest & not pretending that everything is always sunshine & roses. This is why I like you - you're real & not trying to be something you're not. I can completely relate to the being down but not knowing why. Went through a horrible phase of it last year so I really hope you come out the other side soon for your own sake. \nAs for the pregnancy thing - I agree that it's so rude to speculate about someone publicly (not going to lie, with some of my friends I do think it!) as you don't know what's going on behind closed doors. \nStill love your videos & look forward to them 😊
I really don't feel like you have to say sorry for feeling like that. We all have days or periods like that. It's natural. Hope you feel better soon Lily, love you and Anna :) Love from Norway
I alternated between wanting to bring you a cup of tea and offering you a shoulder. I feel like so many of us can not only sympathize but empathize with you as well. In fact, my co-worker and I had a discussion about wanting to crawl under our desks and hide from the world today. Don't ever feel like you have to put on a fake front. Just be you Lily. In terms of the baby conversation, oh boy. My wife and I have been together for 11 years and we only recently decided that even though we love children they simply aren't for us. Surprisingly our parents took the news wonderfully. Everyone else has been a hit or miss. We're very flattered that people think we'd make wonderful mothers, but that doesn't mean it's what we want.
You are such a lovely woman 😍😍
Hope you feel better 💕 I love your honesty, and don't worry about us/your viewers, you do you 👍 😘
We all have times when we are sad and it's ok to be. You shouldn't force yourself to look happy in videos. You're human just like us.
Life is too short to be doing big things you dislike or being around people that you do not want to communicate with. Give yourself permission to take a break and do more of the things you enjoy.  It will bring back your inner smile and help you focus on the things that truly matter to you.
It's so rude to say someone's glowing. I just hate that. I'd definitely rather look dull 😐
Unforunately these days in Italy it really feels like autumn, a lot of Wind and rain 😩
oh Lily, I love when you talk about this whole happiness/grumpiness thing! I'm lucky enough because where i spend most of my days everyone is complaining about everything anyways! I understand the pressure you feel to look like the other bloggers, who are super happy and content all the time. Congratulations on not giving in and doing the same! Congratulations on being still so authentic after all this time blogging. On a different note, I also struggle with my hair and the keratin/brazilian blowouts treatments. Could you do a video on what you have tried so far and your impressions on it? Have you ever actually done any real straightening treatments like those older ones with ammonia? Thank you!
I go through many sad moments and find it difficult to get out of the funk. I found it comforting that I'm not the only one.
Hi Lily - re your lips, I went through something v. similar, suddenly became allergic to some ingredients when I hit 30 - it's really worth seeing a dermatologist and seeing if patch testing would help - may not be the same thing for you but I know how annoying it is to suddenly struggle to wear lipstick!
I support you and appreciate you, Lily. Difficulties in life happen and it's not always something you want to share. Thanks for being open. I enjoyed the vlog. 💜
Lily, you're just so great :)
I always relate to you because of your lower energy, chilled out vibe. Take care of yourself and as always, thanks for sharing :)
I am inlove with that jumper, it looks like the cosiest thing ever!
Lily you really look depressed. I hope you can find some help.
Sending you happy thoughts ❤️😘 x
Feel better.
Lily I love your videos and its so nice that you are real, I work from home and at the best of times I wake feeling so low and literally nothing makes me happy its fine and you are normal but because you have the public presence its more pressure....
A very relatable day! Even if you didn't feel cheery, your vlogs always brighten up my day! X
Dear Lily, I don't usually comment, but I watch every video you upload, so I thought it would be nice to express my support. I hate to hear you're feeling so negative lately. It must be hard to keep up with this kind of work when feeling down, but you're doing a great job and I love your videos! You should not apologise for your mood, I think it's perfectly normal for everyone to have better and worse phases in their life. \nI also agree that the pregnancy comments are terribly rude! My sister recently got a few of those comments and she was really insulted, and I could totally understand her - it's nobody's business! So just try to ignore them :)
Thank you Lily for speaking so openly, I haven't commented on here before but wanted to let you know I appreciate your honesty. We all have times we we feel low and it's so important to talk about our mental health.
Well done for being yourself. You are actually helping a lot of people. We all feel crap sometimes and talking about it is the key. In fact I prefer watching your vlogs when you are raw and real. I loved it :-)
Try the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask - it's incredible.
keep working out Lily.  the endorphins will improve your mental state.  I feel so sluggish when I don't work out. A good jump board session energizes me all day.  Its impossible to not feel better after a workout
Haha I love you and well done for figuring out the rice cooker! Win! I'm a sucker for Lily Pebbles vlogs. My absolute fave vlogger #1 please continue to vlog for the foreseeable future
Enjoyed your vlog.
You be YOU!
Lily, I loved this vlog. I fully empathise with you, as I also don't feel all that great these days. I loved how you did lots of small things to cheer your self up a little. Very healthy and nice to watch. Lots of love xxxx
Moany and whingy hmmm. You're human! We go through shit. It's not all rainbows and sprinkles all day errday
Oh lily! I hope you are ok. Everyone goes through these types of moods and phases and I personally think it's good you are being honest and real! That's why I love you! And you don't look pregnant at all. You are right it's the hardest thing when people keep asking you and expecting you to announce something. I find it awful as we are trying to get pregnant with our second child and we struggled so much with our first and had to go through IVF and everytime someone asked me I just wanted to cry. Same as now.... Thank you for showing that you understand it's not easy for everyone and that you are sensitive to this. I'm sorry for you that people keep asking! Oh and I never comment on videos - I just wanted you to know I was thinking of you! X
so naturally pretty lily! thanks for the video x
Try changing your toothpaste. I got a reaction from a strong/ whitening one and my lips haven't been the same since!
Lily i think it's the change of season that's making you feel low. I honestly have been feeling the same very negative and i for sure think it's the winter blues! Love the honesty, after all you are human and can't possibly always be happy in life. Hope you feel better soon xx
Lily I loved this chatty video! Don't ever feel sorry for being your true, authentic self. It's beautiful.
Like you're Vlogs - speaking very well awesome Video
the christophe robin salt scrub is my favorite scrubbing shampoo and it smells amazing! you don't have to worry about getting anything gritty out of your hair because the salt will eventually dissolve under the spray of your shower
p.s. I know when I worked from home, I felt lonely. Maybe an office space shared with others would help?!
Lily, I truly appreciate you being honest about your feelings and conveying your real feelings rather then being superficial. This is especially important with social media constantly showing us how good other people have it....we all feel down at times and it's so refreshing to hear someone else who feels the same way that I do sometimes. Just this Tuesday I was so sad and anxious and I didn't have any reason. Listening to you today made me feel so much better \n❤️
A good scalp scrub is baking soda! It works suuuper well, just make sure you condition afterwards. Gets rid of flakes and product buildup.
I'm sorry you don't feel up to par. We all have these days. Maybe we all tend to be this way, too, but I find you complain an awful lot sometimes. There's nothing wrong with it. Just my opinion.
I rarely ever post messages but am a regular viewer. We all have crap days but the majority of us don't have to explain ourselves to others. I can only imagine how hard it is to feel like shit in front of thousands of viewers. I love watching your channel because you're a normal person with real emotions. Just keep doing you. You don't need to explain yourself to anyone. It's human to have feelings.  Much love!
You're lovely, that's all I have to say!
Lily, if you can get your hands on the Jack Black Intense Therapy Lip Balm, I HIGHLY recommend it for dry, chapped, and sore lips. The Shea and Mint version is my personal favorite and the only balm I use, especially during the winter months (and I live in Michigan, which is equivalent to Canadian cold all the time).
I normally don't reply on your videos. I watch them to learn and they are good but this blog was pants. Keep reading...not the part where you express your thoughts and feelings, kudos for that. What I found shallow and a little condescending was the non interest in Fenty Beauty. I am about 10 years your elder and American, so I don't always meld with your taste but give you a listen and I learn somethings. Today as a subscriber I felt let down by that flippant attitude. I could be wrong, people don't come for me, it's not worth it, but this is how I saw you today.
I know that you're conscious that you may not come across as being incredibly chipper or bubbly in your videos; but one of the reason I'm subscribed to you and keep watch is because of your realness. It's nice to see how honest you are unapologetically human quite frankly! You come across in a genuinely relatable way which is refreshing. I also love that you check people that ask of assume that someone is pregnant - you're so right about online etiquette! I too feel that fruit flies are the bane of my life right now! Thanks for sharing Lily, much love 💜 x
Hi Lily, I had similar lip issues to yours and after months of trying to figure them out I realized I'm allergic to beeswax, which is found in 99% of lip balms and some lipsticks. It took me a while to realize it was beeswax because I had been using lip balms with it my whole life and never had any problems with it until this year, but apparently it's an allergy you can develop at any time. \nSo far I've only found two lip balms that don't contain any: LUSH None of your Beeswax and Crazy Rumors. Since I started using these and avoiding any other lip products with beeswax, I haven't had any more problems with my lips. I hope this helps! :)
Personally, I find you so much more 'real' than other youtubers. I don't mind the ranting, or grumbling, it's really refreshing actually! Keep on being you, that's why we like you! Your videos are almost like hanging out and catching up with a friend, with bits of travel, makeup, and fashion thrown in. Also total side note, as a fellow curly-haired girl I know you love your hair straight, but I'm so curious so see what it would be like styled with a good curling mousse or gel!
Oh my God about that Fenty *****!! Am sick and tired of all youtube reviewing it;using it,testing it !! I swear I was about to go crazy,I swear I will never buy anything from Fenty Beauty! never ,people go crazy man! And I was sure you aint one, as an old subscriber ,I know ur classy anyway, dont mean to be rude towards Rihannas line ,but people makes you hate it!!*\nAnd Lily, hope you will feel better soon :))) thank you for your honesty, you're amazing the way you are :)))
Whenever I make something with potato, before i put it in the curry or soup etc , i put the potato in the microwave for about two mins, just so speed up the cooking process because potatoes always take so much longer than everything else ! Great video, and love the coat xx
Glad I'm not the only one who basically doubles the amount of garlic in any recipe. Extra garlic is always a must
If your away again with Lilly and you don't want the same videos as her.  Why don't you do a room tour video and view and what you ate in a day.  That would make up another video.   Or a come shopping with me in whatever place your at.
150% obsessed with that coat!! xoxo, caylie
So healthy and INSPIRATIONAL!🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
no joke eating a Block of Cadbury milk chocolate while watching this
Just went to the gym for the first time in weeks and now this video pops up, guess this is a sign to live healthy again hahah - EVERYTHING LOOKS SO GOOOOOOOD 👅👅💗💗
Waiting for your house tour video ...
Thx for being honest!! I feel like a lot of youtubers upload a what i eat in a day and only show the good stuff or pretend to be super healthy and eat super fancy things and small portions only. 😒\nOn another note: the coat is super pretty 😊
Anna I love how honest and normal you are. Brilliant video :)
Anna can i move in with you?? I'm always wearing my dressing gown at home and everyone tells me off! They're so cozzzzzyyyyy!!
A curry and GBBO 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Cute nails!!

Pickled onion monster munch - throw back!!!
Byyyyyeee, love you--cutest cutest cutest bean\n\nI love theeeeese eeeeeee
more WIEIAD videos pls!!!!!!
Great vid subscribed 👌
Hi Anna - OMG I just watched one of may fave celebrities in the Philippines and she mentioned you in her last video - she is a fan of yours!!!! Kris Aquino is the Queen of all Media in the Philippines - she subs to your channel. Be great if you can do a colab with her - that would be awesome. Her channel is https://www.youtube.com/TheAquinos
Hi Anna..Ms. Kris Aquino is a fan of you and wants to meets you. \nhttps://youtu.be/HceqReOKTQc
I always cook more soup to freeze. Usually in autumn my freezer is full of variations of soup 🍵
I am SO happy I've found another Flamin' Hot Monster Munch obsessive. Everyone I know is all about the Pickled Onion (Vom!) 🙌
They have Great British Bake Off on Netflix here in the States and I couldn't stop watching - absolutely love it! 🤗
I'm eating McDonald's and watching this 😳
OMG i've been using estee's soup recipe for years too! love it! hahah
Love your fashion sense so much :D especially the dressing gown :D
Would love to see more of these videos 😍
I love your What I Eat in a Day videos. So many great recipes and meal inspo.
The link to the soup recipe doesn't work, but I'm guessing it's the Power Protein Soup 😏 \nThanks for the inspiration Anna, you just gave me a good idea for lunch and dinner !
That soup look delicious, I'm gonna try it myself!
What size coat did you go for ? Is it true to size ? X
Anna, really miss your evening get ready videos like the one you did in Paris. You did such a great job and the editing was amazing. Would love to see more!
You need to clean your shower head. Put some white vinegar in a ziplock bag, stick the head in the bag, use a hair tie or rubber band to secure the bag , keep it overnight and it will clean itself, next morning just scrub it a little and it will all clean
You should get an immersion blender. Saves so much time for soups like that. You can throw in the veggies straight away and then blend it in the pan.
I love this kind of videos!!
i could watch you for hours and hours!! Love videos like this, more please :-) and by the way: the coat is GOALS, i will order as well. Just for reference: which size did you order? :)
You're my favourite youtuber and absolutely love these chilled types of vlogs! Especially what I eat in a day! ❤️ much love x
This was motivation for me, thanks 😎😇
Your hair is looking soooo glossy and lovely! Updated hair care routine?! x
I love your nails in this video! What is it?!
You are truly a role model. Your vlogs are my favorite !
For a girl who has eaten loads of junk food you look fab!! Love that coat x
Thanks for the healthy motivation.  I've been on the junk food train myself.  Vegetable soup looks so yummy.  I love your new coat too!
Loved your throw back to Barney the Dinosaur haha! Great video, super hungry after watching this now :)
Yet another cracking vlog! Thanks for being incredible with the content... and just in general! www.byharrison.com
Anyone know where you can find a coat like this but way cheaper??
If you love cinnamon grahams, you might like this recipe for grain-free Almond Cinnamon Crunch cereal. It's seriously SO GOOD. Plus the little squares are cute and you feel so accomplished having made your own cereal that's not muesli or granola! https://www.mynewroots.org/site/2017/08/cinnamon-crunch-cereal-hemp-milk/
Just to let you know worcestershire sauce isn't vegan as it has anchovies in it x
Your life is so soothing to watch. I love the coat! I'm looking for a coat just like that except with buttons.
You have a good attitude about food 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻\nBalance is key 🏆
We love your What I Eat In A Day videos! You always have the best recipes that we like to try out. Also, that cost looks incredible on you!\n-Ash & Shelbs xx
I just found your channel a couple weeks ago and I've been catching up and absolutely love all of your videos!
Hey Anna, have your ever tired mixing your Greek yoghurt with protein powder? I have it all the time and it is amazing for the sweet tooth 👌🏼 especially if you the 0% fat rage Greek yoghurt. Definitely give it a try, especially vanilla protein 😍 xxx
Love that coat!!! What size did you get (for reference, not nosy 😬)?
Could you do a video on your favourite cookbooks or recipes?! I'm stuck in a rut with food and needing inspiration 😊
Im eating pizza off of the oven tray while watching this x
Saw the apricot,thought I'd let you know you have a subscriber from Armenia,the homeland of apricot 😊❤️🇦🇲Apricots are amazingly healthy!
All I would love right now is a Dairy Milk Chocolate Bar ngl!! 😂😂
Hi Anna! I microwave my potatoes first to make sure they are soft. Just be sure to stab them first. I can so relate to not everything cooking and coming together at the right time. Most recently for me it was some lentils in a veg chili.
Drinking wine and laying on the couch while watching this.... I noticed you sure know how to cook Anna! You cut things properly and not just pretend (you won't imagine how many of my friends still can't cook!)
Boil your potatoes before putting them in a curry!
If you want potatoes to cook on the stove you have to add liquid otherwise it'd burn before they cook. Also dice them a lot smaller. But man That soup looked so good! I add Worcestershire sauce to everything too lol its so savory and delicious
you always look so chic, loveee the coat 😭😍
Is there a glossier haul coming then?
Gotta have that balance! I bought some chocolate on vacation so I've been treating myself to a piece (or two haha) after meals..but the meals are healthy at least!! :) The vegetable curry looks so good too..and I'm loving that coat.
Anna I keep trying to subscribe to your newsletter and I never receive the confirmation email. I've tried on different days and it just won't work. Just thought you should know in case it's an issue on your end. Love your videos xo
Hey Anna  I <3 your videos. \nAre you planning to do a haul for capsule wardrobe? That would be helpfull. And also some tips to buy clothes that are current but not too trendy because next year they go out of style!!!
I could not relate to this anymore right now! :)
That coat is everything I have ever dreamed a coat to be ✨ NEED IT
Girl you bring joy to my heart ❤️.. and that cookies looks amazing 🍪 🤤
I love these kind of videos!  And I love it on Wednesday's when I wake up there's always an Anna video waiting on me!! 💕💕
Not Lazy! Judicious use of time. :)    Life's too short to waste time making rice
the food looks great!
Potatoes cook faster in water than in sauce. Done the same thing. I think its better to pre-cook them first and throw them in last :)
The picture of that cookie toward the end look ...so GOOD !!!!!!!! Lovely vlog as usual. xx
I just went out to the kitchen, picked at a packet of cooking choc chips without any control/ awareness. I have no idea how much I had....What is wrong with me? :P
I LOVE THESE VIDEOS
And now I'm hungry....;-)
Literally brought that coat in black last week - in love!!!!
Aaahh that music you use, so relaxing. Makes me think of being at the beach, when I really should be working right now haha
I love your What I Eat In a Day videos! ♥
Anna! You didn't show all the chocolate buttons you consumed while watching Bake Off!
Nice Vans Anna! Love your foodie vids.
Loved this 💕
What's your take on the new GBBO hosts? We're so stressed out about it here in the States!
Liked it before watching it cause I love what I eat in a day vids/vlogs 👌🏼
Love your food vids as usual! But the vocal fry was very difficult to listen to .
Please stop being so self indulgent and talking about yourself.
Wow, you're so lucky to have the cherry bombe cookbook already! So excited for it in October! I totally recommend their podcast, it's awesome!
Your voice is annoying
Stock cubes aren't exactly healthy. Just make vegetable stock from fresh vegetables and freeze it.
Christensen played last season with Thorgan Hazard and this season with Eden and Kylian Hazard 😱
5:21 Your hair Lolllllll troll hzarad
Hahah like how Eden and David making jokes with each other😂 Hazard - Just 79 ? But you're strong, you do gym everyday.\nLuiz - noo im intelligent defender not physical 🤓 😂
I think Christensen will be a cheap good player to use at the start of Fifa
Center Backs are slower the left and right backs but i doubht david luiz got slower
He's 8th cos of legends and that
david luiz shooting is a joke in fifa
David Luiz 74 passing? What a joke 😂😂😂!!!
@3:59 When you realise Eden Hazard is the man that voiced Elmo
Eden Hazard doesn't play FUT... He put his overall below his Flag, Club, and position while David Luiz and Andreas Christensen got it right. 😂
Crazy how Hazard has the best dribble and chance creation stats in europe with a 76% success rate but has a lower dribble rating than Messi and Neymar. and whats crazier is Ronaldo is only 2 behind him on 90 with only 25 successful dribbles last season
Guys please if everyone donates something we can get him off the street. I dont have much myself and know how its like. go to his go fund me\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/helpanthonyoffthestreet
Imagine Leicester city players growing from 70 to 80+ from FIFA 16 to 17😂
Christensen either has really good english or really bad geography cause he doesnt sound like a man fron denmark.
2:09\nLooks like they're pointing guns at them to make them talk
Am I the only one who would've kept David Luiz's card as he predicted it? I mean sure, he'd be a CB Ruud Gullit with not as good dribbling but it's true that his shooting and pace should be higher.
Where's batshuayi i \nwanted to see his reaction to his stats XD
Do man united next
David Luis is fantastic character. I love Rio. What a legend though I'm not even Man united fan.
Really no respect for david and christensen
The shooting and passing should be more than 64 and 74 WTF?!
Wtf .. David luiz shooting should have been much higher
I love the background music !! On all videos! It's just so classy.
I hate how fifa has a preset of player ratings based on their position, like assuming that defenders have a passing and dribbling between 50-60 rated, thats not fair. \n(IMO: they should do the ratings based on the season stats/numbers of the player)
This was hilarious, thoroughly entertained, more of this please :)))
this is soooo cringy, cuz players dont care about their stats on a videogame...
My friend  everytime says Liverpool is better than Man Utd and the only thing am telling   is 26 years :D
dont you just love Luiz's personality??
FIFA need to improve David shoting it least but it 70
What's the song
What is the song ?
Damn it five INVEST IN YOUR FUCKIN SOUND RECORDING JEEEZZUZZZZ u want it to be top notch but the sounds is fuckin balls...
Rio: anything you're not happy with\nEden: Your hair
That Christiansen sounds bare English
Poor Christensen he looks so disappointed 😟 He deserves more. Even Rio admitted how good his passing is 😡😡
FIFA gives the defenders no respect tbh,shooting and pace could be improved to almost all defenders
These two are really funny man . Damn !
David and hazard seems like they are very good friends:)
The shot rating of defenders are actually a joke just because they are defenders it doesnt mean they cant shoot
How come Rio looks tiny next to David Luiz? I thought they were supposed to be the same height.
rio says one and only hazard yet he has like 10 brothers and luiz and christensen are the truly one and only \n#clownseverywhere
loved how rio and eden called out fifa for just taking the piss
What about David's Hair rating\n\n\n99 LONGNESS     99 CURL\n\n99 BRAZILIAN      99 SWAG\n\n99 DAVID              99 LUIZ
I'm subscribing to anyone who likes this comment and subscribers to me. Just comment done✓ so i can know
66 physical for Hazard is joke. The only way people can get him off the ball is by fouling him. He's not a tall or physically imposing player, but he doesn't get pushed off the ball easily.
COME ON PREM TEAMS IN CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SHOW THEM HOW YOU CAN PLAY LIKE IN PREMIERSHIP. (COME ON!)
The is the thing that slows David Luis is his Afro(keep the Afro David Luis 
I love how close hazard and luiz are
I want more of this pls, show me ronaldo, i wana see his first when he hears he is not the number one rated player on fifa lol
I'm sure hazard already googled his
whats the music at 5:17
ngl i love it when Hazard says because it's true man! to david luiz aha
What did ea take?\nAndreas christensen was in the top 20 fastest players in bl last season and you give him 64 pace??\nAt least 75
pause the video at 4:25 😂😂😂
One and only mate
Surprised Luiz didnt make all his stats 99. \nBut Christensen has a good rating with quite poor main stats.
I'm in the gym everyday man. Lol this was gold!
Luiz has a better shot than strikers, and he's right, his left foot is mad.\n\nShould be 5* weak foot\n84 shot
My right ear enjoyed this..
As a Chelsea fan i just want to that Chelsea looks like the best club to play for, nice players and staff. GREAT TEAM! CHAMPIONEEEE💙💙💙💙💙💙
You go gym everyday I died 😂😂😂
# RIP KOLASINAC
I love Rio

background song?
FIFA have underrated our boys!!
hazard is a better dribbler than messi
No respect-hazard 😂
Lmao hazard put 5 for his defending lololol
Song Name please
wow... posh accent from Christensen, amazing...
someone finnaly got there ratng right
Funny lads

Nice more pls

Awesome channel. You got me hooked on your style. Liked and subbed.
Can't wait for the YSAC musical.
Is this William osman???!!!
I wonder if he is single i would like ti have him😛😜😋😀🍆🍆🍌
Your videos used to be soo much funnier and actually informative. Nowadays you just put butter on toast with a 2 minute song and some sponsors. You're going downhill homie.
anyone else see the ant at 5:50
What kind of dog does he have
I doubt most people will not get this but... he sounds like the sane alan tutorials
Thats all is look so delicious but there so funny vidios
Why do you sound like real life Tina Belcher
Thanks to these damn videos, it is now physically impossible to say pepper one time.
I usually just lay my hand on the hot stove to get rid of salmonella
You sound so calm ant yet so fed up with everything and that is beautiful
Please do the Scooby Doo sandwich that is probably, 10 feet or something.
imagine his neighbours just staring at him while he attaches a hose to a chicken breast
I feel like this Crack head is actually in culinary classes
How is it you've done this for so long without a decrease in entertainment?
Yea well you suck at making more videos, you should work on that by making more
Damn. I was really expecting that ladybug to get blown over like the last one. Stupid ladybug.
Let's have more fun with the different breeds of chicken like fried chicken, popcorn chicken, buffalo chicken (or buffalo wings?), or chicken cordon bleu.
How do I not suck at cooking hot dogs?
Has anyone actually tried any of these recipes? If so are they any good?
when is the next casually explained episode
I'm late again god dammit
Do a face reveal

Why do you sound like my English teacher? 😂
Anyone else wondering what's  next in the egg saga of John and Douglas
You have inspired me to cook more and eat more... I never ate a pirogi before I saw your pirogi episode.... now there one of my favorite foods..
Okay but so, the serious instructions in this actually worked. I cooked chicken breast for the first time the other and it turned out perfectly. Going again today.
How did I find this channel just now? I love it.
There are two kinds of people\n\nThis guy\n\n\n\n\n\nand howtobasic
So does he live in Canada or vermont
I live next door to Sam and Ella. Should I be worried that they might kill me?
am i having a stroke
Peas be with you.
I laughed SOOOOO hard at the juicy chicken squirt! Dude, LAUGHED! 😆😅
Always waiting for the songs in the end
You forgot to say that the chicken breast has to be T H I C C and J U I C Y
I'm new to YSAC, and the only thing I don't like about his videos is the way how he says Pepper pepper pepper. Like for real, how fucking cheesy do you have to be in order to say pepper 3 times? Why not only 1 time? What's wrong with you?
You are taking How To Basic to the next level dude +You Suck At Cooking
Where the fuck are your gloves
First video i seen! Subscribe
gorden ramsay: ITS SOO FUCKING RAW IT COULD STILL FLY

He doesn't mention it but you have to be a level 4 wizard for some of these recipes
Why does his guy remind me of theodd1sout?
For some reason I am now fully convinced that he is a robot.\nThat's why he kicked that other robot out of his house.\nHe was obviously jealous
my god this is fucking stupid
How have I not found this channel before? Hilarious !!

I'm glad I found this channel
Anyone else have reservations about this channel? The humor (people claim) is top notch but, after watching many videos, it seems like the same I have ADHD and I'm really not clever but everyone thinks I'm a god type of channels, I swear, I've seen dozens of these. It feels like zfrank and a milder htb had a baby, can be clever and entertaining on occasion but 72% of the time it's just braindead comedy that highschool girls go crazy over:/
400degrees fahrenheit,  celsius or kelvin?
I looooooooove the colours of the blue/ green/ gold one!!
I had a big ol' smile the entire time I watched this video! What an adorable idea!! <3
I am going to have to do this with my pigeon!
Louie looks like Dewey from Malcolm in the Middle
aww so cute. rats are really underrated pets
Would you be able to paint his little feeties with the food colouring alone? Then it might not crack away and give you a higher colour saturation xx
I love this!!! \nI really want to do this with my cat baby now! \n🖤
I wish I could've done this with my little baby, but he passed away about a week ago on the 11th.
This is so cute. Now I want to do this with my babies (2 German shepherds).
Omg it's so cute! So now we know why Louis​ is so creative, he got it from his mum :D and the poo is just his personal special signature
I need help\nI got 2 new rats \nStorm and Karkat Karkat is mega scared for me can you maybe make a video of about how to get a rat to like you I'm scared he will never like me and will keep on running away from my hand 😢
Sooo cute <3
Your videos are so pieceful ☺
This is so adorable!! 😭😭😭 I want to do this with all of my little animal babies
Aw look at his little old man feet. He's adorable and was a very well behaved stamp. Mine would have me and the house covered in paint but not the paper! I actually got a print of one of my boys just after he passed, I wanted to keep a print of them all. But I forgot so only did 1 which sucks. But think I'll start from now on to do alongside my photos of them in my memories scrapbook. This was so cute x
More what I eat in a day/week PLEASE!!!!
Oh this is so cute!!! can i ask what font did you use on the 'painted by' bit? thanks in advance!
This is so cute, I wanna try this with my ratties <3
i really liked the editing style of this video.
I was unsubscribed to this channel and missed this video. I had to subscribe again. What is going on with Youtube??. This is so cute, yeah defiantly do another one. I'm glad you framed it what a beautiful thing to do.😊
This video is so lovely! Thank you for uploading it. ❤️
I love your videos
Get another rat please I mean... You should get another rat...
you should make an etsy shop!!
We love you so much!!
It came out amazing 💕🐁
I lost one of my ratty girls this time last year that I was very close to. Before we lost her, we pressed her feet into a soft piece of fimo, baked it and then had it silver plated and popped in a frame. Little more expensive way of doing things, but she was worth it, and now we have little silver pawprints to remember her by 🐀 (you could always paint the baked fimo or leave it as it is too)
yeeeees!! a beautiful video with the beautiful little lou bean <3 loved this
Watching this weirdly enough comforted me. Been crying since my other half is traveling for 3 weeks from today and anxiety has kicked in (the whole what if this happens to him? Or omg what if he doesn't come back). So thank you for this. It really calmed me 🙂
This is BRILLIANT!!! What a awesome idea, thank you. I'm getting my boys and doing this RIGHT now lol. And my dogs as well and my mouse..
I had to say goodbye to my gorgeous baby hammy today and I'm feeling pretty devastated. This video was precious, and really soothed me.🐹✨😘
oh goodness i'm crying at that little card, so cute!!
Aw I want a little Louie! I'm warming to rats since watching your videos 😊 just need to find rats from a nice home or place first xx
This was such a lovely video :') <3
Such a beautiful video!\nWhat brand of watercolor paint do you use? Where did you get your water color brush(es)?
You are such a lovely human. I'd love to drink tea with you and have ratty cuddles xx
Aw, what a well behaved stamp indeed! I'm not sure if it would require too much pressure, but maybe imprint his paws in some clay?
I did this with my hamster and I ended up just diluting the food coloring with water and soaking a paper towel with the mixture. That way he could just keep running though the colors and on to the paper. Worked really nicely and didn't fade! If you try it again I recommend this method ❤️
This was such a precious idea! 💕\n\nI was also a rat mother for three years. My little man's name was Moon and I plan on getting a tattoo for him in the near future. He had two sisters, Starlight and Dreamer, but they did not make it because they were weened off of their mother too early. Moon was a fighter and he made it, then he made my life grand. My father originally got them as food for one of our reptiles, but they were just too cute and my father then switched all of our lizard's food to frozen mice, eggs, and crickets. Moon came into my life at a really important time, I was 17 years-old and had gotten some bad news about my health. So he made me a mother and he was the best pet ever. I wish I had done a cute little art project like this with him.\n\nThank you so much for sharing your and Louie's adventures and love with us. ❤️
This is such a lovely video :) my girlfriend and I have 4 rats, Kronos, Zeus, Hades and Poseidon. I've been looking for a gift idea for her and she happens to adore the rats, so this is something I could give her as a gift :)
This is an adorable idea... I think I know what my little rat is doing this weekend.
What a great idea! I'll have to do this with my kitties!
yup, definitely doing this tonight with my girls. I don't have food coloring but I think beetroot juice and some butterfly pea tea will do just fine.
I misread this as painting WITH ratson, idea for better video
Beautiful! Loved this idea! Makes me want to do this with my corgi.
PLEASE MAKE MORE RAT VIDEOS HE IS SUCH A GOOD BOY
I love this so much, ratties are such beautiful little creatures, and it's wonderful to see I'm not the only one who's a crazy rat mumma! So adorable ❤️
Maybe just test out the non toxic paints before you subject Lou to it haha. Test it on the paper you intend to use and nail polishes or other clear preservatives over top to see if it holds. (I never think of this shit before I try new things either) I thought you were going to lay down a cardboard maze with the paper underneath it with a thin layer of paint near the beginning which he would track through. You could make one cardboard maze, rotate it, put a different paint near the start, and even if you didn't get good prints you would have paint scuffles that have an artistic winding to them. \n\nMy personal anecdote related to paw painting: I was in the living room of a rental painting with India ink on the table. I don't even remember what I was drawing! So I finish up, mostly clean up and go take a shower. I never know what to do with the remaining watered down India ink. I'm not going to pour it back in but it seems a waste to toss it. So I left it out on the table. I go into my room after my shower and realize my cat, who never does this, is under my bed. He seems distressed. I realize there's a few India ink paw print tracks in my room and the living room and the table. It made me laugh so much. I managed to clean it all up, except for a blurred par print on the stone of the propane fireplace. So he left his mark there. (And I did get my deposit back). I almost wish he had tracked it over paper so I could have kept it. He also luckily didn't get sick. It was pretty cute to see him ashamed. It was so unusual and so interesting that he seemed to grasp the concept that he did something wrong.
Omg that is such a good idea! I might do that with my kitty, probably have to leave a trail of treats for her to do it but it'd be fun. \nWish we did that for my sister's and my previous pet ratties and miceys. Sadly my sister's eldest rat Jerry passed away this evening :( Lou reminds me alot of him actually, such a cutie pie he was. He's in ratty heaven now with his brother Ben (they was names after the brand Ben & Jerrys icecream).
Little rat paw prints would make such a cute small tattoo!
This is so sweet! Such a lovely idea, I might have to have a go with my pets... although the horse will be rather interesting to do...
I started with a hamster, and I have mice now... but it's gonna have to be ratties next! I love him!!!! <3
This is so precious I'm crying aaaaa it came out so well 😭❤️
This video is so precious! I love it! (^_^)
you are sooooo creative :) you have to get one of your leaf drawings tattooed
That is the cutest bloody thing! 💕
LOVED this video! It was so sweet to see such a special moment between you and Louis. :) Perhaps my favorite video of yours all year! <3
More painting with Louis! I love it
I love all your videos but this is just so cute, it's such an original idea as well 😊❤️
I was just going to add next time maybe just mash up some blueberries and raspberries to use as paints? It would have more of a watercolor effect but could be more effective when drying and safe for little bean to lick himself clean! :D Loved this video and I want to try it with my boys now too <3 xo
I am gonna do this with my rats! 💖🐀
Watching this with my 4 rattos clambering over me. Must try something similar, they're really lovely.
Next time you could try using really well mashed blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, or pomegranates. All of them should be completely safe for him to eat and they stain really well. I've tried painting with them before and would recommend doing a test on paper to see what you like most because the colors will change as they dry. They might stain his fur for a bit though.
Painted by Lou and mum 😭 that is the cutest!!! Xx
This is such a sweet and creative idea! Lou is so adorable, such a sweet little rat 🐀. They look awesome and I love the little card 🌟. Such a cute picture 💖.
This is the most precious thing I've ever seen I would buy these pieces done by a beauty and a bean ❤️
this is the best video i've ever seen
oh my goooooood. i wanna do this with my babies. but they are not as keen on being held without having their feet supported... so cute <3
this is a great idea. not sure my recent boys will like getting painty feet...hmmmm
your rattie art is gorgeous ! i managed to get footprints in that foamy air drying clay that u use for babies handprints of my two g.pig boys Pumpkin and Erik.
Oh goodness, his feet are SO CUTE!
Kiera- I need to thank you so so so much for this video. 1)i love rats 2) your painting was so good so so nice. This idea made me tear up a little, because its so much more than a picture. It's something ur little rat touched and made. I will do this with my pets. <3
your videos are so relaxing :)
awww this is so sweet!! what a talented little bean! I want to do this with my two girls now :') <3
I'm crying this is so cute!!! You are such a great rattie mum! Staying home to be with him is the sweetest :))))))

your rat really needs another rat friend. im sure you can find another male around the same age.
Can someone please explain to me how this is trending? Only has 11k views
I hope Louie lives forever! 😘
omg... all of the other rats passed away i am sooo sorry i literally starting sobbing once i heard that i loved ur pet rats sm now i feel bad for always saying more rat videos more rat videos i am so sorryyyy ;((((((((((
JonTron Video with 300,000 Views in 50 Minutes = Nowhere on the Trending Page\n14,000 Views in 2 Days = 16 On the Trending Page\n\nOut of curiosity, how much *does* is cost to bribe YouTube to be on the Trending Page?
When you pay for trending
Probably my favourite album of all time ! :-)
Automatic For The People changed my life.
my all-time favorite r.e.m. album.  i only listen to the album on rainy days.
This album is a real masterpiece. Thank you R.E.M.
Beautiful album, great memories
Where’s Michael?
This album makes me wanna turn photographer, work with art, create something that matters.... Thank you REM!
Yesssssss
Where's Bill? A big part of this album seemingly deleted from history.
Wow! Two of the most impressive alternative rock albums of all time are getting re-released this year. R.E.M's #Automatic25 and The Smiths #TQID Both are on the list of my all time favorites.
When Peter says nothing else that came out that year sounded like that I was thinkingUm Yeah?! That's why you guys were great! Same could be said for Out of Time or Life's Rich Pageant, etc. A band that can write Wendell Gee and Turn you Inside Out, I mean, come on. As for AFTP Star me Kitten and Find the River get me every time. Millsey's background vocals are legend.
They never went wrong with Scott Litt. The best producer ever right after George Martin ! Good interviews with Peter and Scott !
OK, I've finally settled on my ranking of R.E.M albums from best to worst, and wish to share it with the world:\n\n1.) FIVE WAY TIE: Chronic Town/Murmur/Reckoning/Fables of the Reconstruction/Life's Rich Pageant\n2.) Out of Time\n3.) Monster\n4.) THREE WAY TIE: Document/Green/Automatic for the People\n5.) TWO WAY TIE: Up/Accelerate\n6.) THREE WAY TIE: New Adventures in Hi-Fi/Around the Sun/Collapse into Now\n7.) Reveal\n\nI'd enjoy a fierce debate with fellow YouTubers :)
I'm hating this video solely due to the fact that they whacked a honking great big preview add on their imitation of life video. Please get rid of it.
One of the greatest albums of all time
Magic, I will be getting this, well done including demos and particularly photograph 👍🏻
25 years. This music is still in my heart. Forever!
Wow! The deluxe edition sounds incredible! Dream scenario right now would be having an awesome surround sound stereo and a weekend to listen to all of their 25th anniversary editions.
Bem que eles poderiam fazer um turne de despedida
Phenomenal work
YEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAA BWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Greetings from Chile
Liiiiindo!!!!!demais!!!!!!🎧🎻🎸🎼🎵🎺🎹
1:08 Bill?
Their best ?
Ignoreland 🤦🏻‍♂️
Thank you
Meu álbum favorito!
Lindo.📀🎵🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶
I bought AFTP in 1995- I was fourteen.  I would listen to it through headphones and I'd cry myself to sleep...but not because it brought me sadness--  it was just so beautiful.  Try Not to Breathe still makes me cry every time I listen to it.
Not their best album, but still cool.
You can grab a piece and go The fact that you guys think I wont eat the entire thing in one go is adorable. Misguided, but adorable.
Berry bark.\nWoof.\n\nI am DEAD, you guys are so awesome.
I'm berry pleased about this recipe.
Who cares about the food. I'm wondering where Barry's jacket is from
*Does SortedFood consciously have Barry in your berry-related videos?*
em-BARRY-sing
Lower in fat; lower in sugar; delicious. You're contradicting yourself when you say that.
a little bit of honey ... 😂😂
3:46 *woah*
Not sure if they have them in Britain, but my favorite ice lolly is the orange creamsicle.
Do you have to use Greek Yogurt? Could you get the same effect from just using regular yogurt?
It's soo pretty and Pink
Cannot wait to try this!!
You guys should use lavender in more recipes, it's honestly one of my favorite flavors.
where's the sprig of mint
My God, Barry has become very handsome. He is down right dreamy.
lavender, drop a sprig or two of mint in when blending, then drizzle the top with melted chocolate  before freezing?  or even some green tea macha...hmm
This is very similar to my mamma's home made ice cream. She only uses three ingredients. Greek yogurt. Fruit (usually raspberries since I'm allergic to strawberries) and caster sugar. That's it, than she shoves in her ice-cream maker for several hours to let it thicken. We keep the seeds from the raspberries in as we think it makes it taste more interesting. I think I'll add honey next time to see the results.
We don't get Greek Yogurt where I live. Can I use normal yogurt?
What did he call the cranberries
Does any yoghurt work? Or only greek yoghurt?
I just want to say, I started watching your videos because theyre fun to watch but I dont rlly cook\nBut recently I had a cooking class (weird for a science major, i know, but seeing how geeky Ben is it prob makes sense) and your videos help a lot so thanks
I love these Kenwood made better videos! Sponsoring made right! :) I'm always in search for something healthy but indulgent and rich that can fool me and satisfy my cheat needs, so this videos are perfect ahah
Looks delicious but bad for people with sensitive teeth
This looks like a winner!
Yay, I got featured in a video ^_^
Now I know how else I can use my frozen berries I bought sometime back. THANK YOU
Why Greek yogurt? I hate Greek yogurt. It tastes of cream cheese. Would a different yogurt work for this?
given that your carbonara took me 45 minutes to make, this seems right up my alley. :)
Hi I'm a long time lover of your channel and I'm going off to uni on Sunday, it would be kinda cool if you did some budget friendly, student friendly dishes
How long can these last in the freezer? Thanks!
Wow I think I wanna give this a go!
Bung some bacon in it.
u could make a nutella frozen bark.. just  blend nutella yogurt and frozen banana with a bit of vanilla...!! perfect for a chocoholic ♥__♥
Great timing - now summer is over! ;)
Would this use with a coconut or soy yoghurt instead? :)
Oo you could do coconut yoghurt, with mango pieces and lime zest 👌🏼
I really wanted to try this recipe but I am allergic to lavender. Is there an alternative
Look awesome guys!!! But I wonder if we can do it with lime and mint? I love the sour taste and if it won't work just add some rum and booomm we just created a freaking mojito ice cream!!! :))
Ok but Barry looks like a Matalan model. I'm not complaining!
so simple, but looks so good!  would goat's milk yogurt work instead of regular (cow)??
literally about to go make this right now
LAVENDER? Who are you and what did you do with Ben's mint?
in love with Barry's hair😍
I don't know if I keep missing the videos or have they stopped announcing what the next week's theme is? I haven't seen the mystery box in a while and you guys haven't been directing us to the website for a sneak peak on next week's theme as far as I know? Are they announcing all of their stuff on other social media now?\nI'm so confused >.<\n\nAlso I know this is an ad and is likely unrelated to what you guys are doing this week.
man this looks sooo good 😭 once i get discharged from the hospital, i am so making this!!
Ben can't replace mint with lavender. What has the world come to?
it's so fast it's almost emBERRYssing
Berry's poor heart shattered faster then the bark did as Ben destroyed it😂
So I've made this before and my problem with it is that it's too cold to bite into, but when it is warm enough to bite into it makes a huge mess all over your fingers. Does anyone else have this problem and any solutions?
Can you use any replacements for the lavender?
After seeing the headline, I was sure you were going to finish the video by stuffing frozen yogurt and tree bark down Barry's pants. And I'm kind of disappointed it didn't happen.
How can I get rid of the ice crystals? I had problems finding a large tray so it became a bit thicker than I wanted it to be... Will it have a smoother texture if I make it thinner or is there any trick for it?
Em(berry)sing to call a recipe
looks so good this guys, whats the texture like?
Calm down Ben! Just coz it's easy doesn't mean it's embarrassing as a recipe.  You're embarrassing. As a snob. 😑
My father has been making this homemade ice cream for years and years. It's the easiest thing ever and it's so good, only ever eaten it as soft serve
Forgot to call it an #ad.
Soooo....can I do it with cheese and bacon?
What is a lollie?  I'm from Canada 🇨🇦. \n\nThis looks awesome! Way to go! Also love the humour.
Ben, you are the star of this show...you could have your own channel.
any video that involves berries *has* to have Barry in it. this is a rule
Where can you get a packet of Lavender in herb form?
I have the same blender...can recommend if anyone is intersted.
I am sad cz i can't have these 😯
Here's a recipe that I've always been curious to try but never have cuz I never found a recipe: *Lavender Ice Cream*\nI saw the ice cream in the movie It's Complicated and I've always wondered how you put lavender in ice cream.\nMight I request this recipe from you guys at SORTED Food?
This is a quick to make, quick to eat recipe. You literally have to eat it quick, otherwise you get froyo fingers 😃 I would try it though, if it wasn't 16 degrees outside... 🤒
I knew barry's actual bark was coming but i still laughed really hard
Very up-town.  Can also be done with bananas and chocolate if berries aren't your thing and chocolate is..
nice! will make that
The two best things in life have come together.\n\nI've always love white chocolate bark, and frozen yoghurt. THE DREAMS ARE ALIVE.
I'm so jealous of Barry's eyebrows
i was wondering if you could make this with pumpkin and ginger snaps for a autumn style?
This is doing to be a healthy snack😍
Definitely going to try this one! Not sure about grab and go, maybe grab shove in my face before it melts all over my hand
What about adding some mint to the mix, just to give it that kick? Mint and berries are great together! (Plus, it would make Ben happy😂)
Twisters
You didn't listen did you. 😂😂😂😂
YUM!
I will skip lavender.
Please some more healthy frozen foods pls
Ohhhh sassy Ben You didn't listen, did you?
Ok this, but mint choc chip orrrrrrrr, who knows, endless choices.
Nom
Ice lollys is a dumb name for a popsicle.  Lollipop + Icicle is better than Ice + Lollipop.  Wait.  Hmmmmm....
Cherry brandy was my fav
FAB ICE LOLLIES!!!!!!!
Ben marry me 😘
It looks so yummy 😋
Zaps were the best!!
Genius!😍
hi
looks shit
I don't like yogurt. Could you do this with ice cream?
😍 I wish I weren't on a diet
I can't even stand the smell of lavander, i will never understand why people eat it !
Mini Milks for the Win!! I loved them as a kid too! The vanilla or chocolate were the best \n\n(That's the milk lolly Ben is talking about at the beginning)
Seems delicious, but with the cold and (kind of) stormy weather I would much rather have something warm or comforting. Any chance you guys will make some autumny recipes?
Looks lovely and will be making it with my grandchildren but does it not melt fast?
Can anyone explain to me what lavender would taste like? Besides lavender of course... Whenever I hear of adding a flavor like rose or lavender I get this vision of eating soap or perfume.
Pengwings
omg..! after The Current War and then The Child in Time trailer.. i'm ready for this.. can't wait! XD
Dear BBC could you reveal the air date asap thanks! Can't wait to watch it
benedryl cucumberpatch is BBC's ultimate clickbait.
Yeees Benedict! Whatever he does, its just the best! <3 Cant wait to watch this. Its going to be beautiful and emotional just like his movie Third Star. It made me cry alot.
I'm gonna cry a lot.
Υesss, Benedict!
I guess this will have to make up for the Sherlock withdrawals.
I see Benedict Cumberbatch. I watch. He's just so irresistible (I'm not gay).
Sees Ben Cumberbatch, yep I'm totally watching this.
Heavy Rain by BBC One
sooooohot...just sayin.
2 Best things in it.\n1) BENEDICT\n2) MUSIC
Press x to scream KATE!!!!
The Child In Time airs on Sunday September 24 at 9pm on BBC One.
Can time heal?\nNo but Doctor strange can.
He needs to be used for another Sherlock series never mind this
Lost a daughter? Don't wonder around! Go to Bake street!!!
I love you,benny
Sherlock has a child 😉👍🏻
This is the one case Sherlock can't solve
This looks good
I Wonder, do you think that Kate is a Time Lady? I'm just curious.
All series dealing with marriages are a real rip-off.
Looks so good
this is healing my Sherlock withdrawal! <3
Hey! If you from future please write, what you think about the film!
Looks good!!🙊 I love benedict❤
What will happen to Sherlock? Thats it?
(tempted to draft new love letter right here and now) My Darling Benedict--It has been so long!...etc. etc.
I swear they could have just used cctv?
Omg iv read the book ik what happens can't wait to watch this 😆😆😆😆
As soon as I saw cumberbatch, CLICK
Oh mah gah I am HYPED FOR THIS! LOVE YOU BUMBLEBEE CUCUMBERPATCH!
I'M intrigued it sounds so good and i like Benedict's performance
I have been waiting for this since that summer 2017 trailer for BBC Drama. Love it so much.
IM HERE BEFORE THIS GOES VIRAL AND MAY I JUST SAY\n\n\n\nthERe gOEs mY hEArT

If Your An Upcoming Artist Check Out My Page For Free Beats!🔥💯🚨
Good Movie is coming kkkkkkkkkk (and sorry but it's no possible no remember of ParentLock)
Don't worry this is Sherlock Holmes he will find her this finna be be a breeze.
when comes it out
When will we be able to watch it then? x
Why can't anyone in the comments speak English?
Penglings
Where can I see it(I haven't got television)?
Is this gonna be a tv series or movie?
IM NOT READY
Christ that looks depressing just what we all need. Why can't they do a drama about losing a fiver, or drinking an unexpectedly cold cup of tea, or perhaps a smoking tiger with anger issues and a love for left socks. Off to GPs for some anti depressants tomorrow, thanks.
The role looks perfect for Benedit Cumberbatch and I already can't wait for it! Its going to be something without a doubt!
I can`t wait. Ah, my love Benedict!
A couple of days ago a couple of dudes drove up to a High School near Rubery in Birmingham, trying to lure a child around 12 to get in their car because they knew her mom. \nI really wish a channel would commission To Catch A Predictor UK. It'd be so popular, plus it'd strike fear into the nonces, knowing they could be exposed to the nation on TV. Please, please, please, please
Shame he doesn't have the TIME STONE
Ben you made this year awesome!\nCan't wait
Book of the week, A bad storm by Theresa Down....................
No Benedict, you are SHERLOCK, you can Find her.
when does it come on ??
'The child in time' seems like a good title for a Dr Who episode. The return of the Drs Daughter?
HE WOULD BE SUCH A GOOD DAD IM SO OVERJOYED
Omg yuuuus back at BBC, love a good BBC series especially with benedict
This is going to be available in America right
This looks like it's going to be great! Can't wait to see it!
Ben and the little girl playing - fills my heart up
I thought this was a Wholock episode because of the title
Se Inscreva Se No Meu Canal
That little girl looks like side eyeing Chloe
Taken: Mild version
Benefit cucumbrhatch
SHAUN SHAUN SHAUN

When?
YEES! Benedict and Kelly together?! Deffo gonna watch this
HASSİKTİR BENEDİCT AŞKIM ÇOK SEKSİYLİİ AHHHH
Looks good
Nice
Anyone with just an ounce of empathy cannot but be gripped by the power of Cumberbatch in this trailer. My heart and stomach are tight from it.
Waaalt!
every film : ben running
Benedict? Okay Im watching this
Bonkyhort Cutiebrunch
Sees Benedict, clicks.
heavy rain
What the fuck
#we_need_Sherlock_Holmes
Can't wait.....
OMFG SLAY YES BENEDICT HAS RETURNED
Just use your deduction skills, Sherlock!
Doctor Strange looks fucked
awwwww.. Ben!! I must see this!! (but I'm in Germany :( )
Oh look... The McCann's need more money... So another kidnap series... Notice the girl's name is KATE
Jesus 10 years after I had to read this shite in AS English they're making a show of it.  Worst crap I've ever read, and I've read Dan Brown.
No effects but it looks like it has not done any editing
I feel like there is going to be a twist...that she has actually died and they are in denial
He lost his kid in the supermarket lol what a dumbass
Meh, doesn't look as good as The Missing
Oh my god benedict as a dad
Benedict Cumberbatch\n\n\n\n\nWho?
Aman benedict sen 5. Sezon çekme de current war ve bunu çek :( üzdü neyse bizde bunlarla idare edecez.Bunu ingilizce yazamıyorum ya yetmedi ingilizcem inş Türk çıkar
Shit
Why not make another season of Sherlock if you had time for this :////
All to well is the best ts song
I love how Andy keeps trying to stir the pot regarding T Swift and not one of these older celebrities gives a shit
THE SCARF IS CLEARLY IN HIS DRAWR, EVEN NOW
its i left my scarf there at your sister house and you still got it in your drawer even now
Maggie looks like she's an aristocrat from the 1930's.
all too well is not just A song is THE song
Olivia B is a legend for asking that question haha! Especially if that's a false name to honour Taylor's cat!
left my scarf there, at your sister's house, and YOU still got it IN YOUR DRAWER even now.
In a song?? All Too Well is #That song
All too well is such a masterpiece
Wait a minute... what happened to but you keep my old scarf from that very first week, cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me?  \nI thought she was talking about him not his sister.. i mean yes, she left it at his sister's house at one point but then he got it and kept it to himself
it might not have been about jake?
Jake has the scarf. He keeps it in his drawer, even now.
NO he still has it! in his drawer, even now
Lol Maggie doesn't care
im sure Taylor has many more missing scarves
wow people actually ask Maggie about the scarf? lol, it's jake you need to ask!
All Too Well is the best song to ever exist *period*
All too well is the best song that Taylor has ever written. Yes, the equivalent to ATW in her other albums are 'back to December', 'clean' etc... but it's by far the most beautiful she has ever composed. It's her 'case of you' know whattamean.
00:40 is that guy 50 cent???
I feel like she should have Kristen scalls voice
Obviously the scarf is Taylor Swift's innocence (virginity). She left it at his sister's house. Swift's Red is actually her best lyrically with metaphors. Her songwriting skills during Red was even compared to that of Leonard Cohen.\n\n\n\nOh, and the album's title is Red. RED!!!!
All to well is the best ts song...https://goo.gl/czCVJA
Rachel Dawes is Jakes brother?! Small world
If she does have the scarf, please God make her cover up that butter face.
All Too Well is her best song
Imagine what'll happen if Taylor releases that 8 minutes version...
The amounts of fucks she gives is perfection.
Maybe someone can use that scarf and silence Taylor swift.
Maggie doesn’t have Taylor’s scarf. Taylor specifically says in the song that Jake kept her scarf because it reminds him of innocence and smells like her.
Maybe the song isn't even about Jake after all lol maybe it was another dream of hers that inspired it
*ALL TOO WELL IS THE SONG*
i cannot believe it's even trending. FIND THE SCARF ALREADY!!! Taylor needs peace. . . Well, more the Swifties. Lmao.
Texas underground artist, trying to better myself and get my family out of the streets, help me get heard, share, follow, repost, thanks 🙏 https://soundcloud.com/legit-tim \nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/open_graph/artist/2950553
រឿងសិច
Taylors saying I fucked jake at your sisters house
She been looking grandmothery for the last ten years...she just has one of those grandmother faces
inquiring minds want to know. god I'm going to retch.
Shes aging quickly
Give it back!
Maggie G. looks like Sloth from The Goonies.
DAFUQ she has on, an aluminum foil dress?
*Give it back!*
Find in Maggie
I love Maggie's ring!
Why does she look 90?
Secret: Andy Cohen is really......Alex Trebec....
Its my grandma!
50 s laugh...contagious 😂😂😂😂
'All Too Well' is Taylor's Top 5 best songs. PERIOD. That is a fantastic song, I want her and Jake to get back together and break up so she can write a sequel.
Taylor's too ugly for jake anyways... Cringy piece of shit.
well said Maggie who cares, swiftards should get over it, Taylor's  BS is exhausting
Taylor is a walking STD. More men than Elizabeth Taylor.
Her face reminds me of that old episode of the Twilight Zone, when the old man that was dying made his relatives wear masks to recieve their inheritance. js
Can't believe my video 10 Kittens 1st Day Outside has over 2 million views now! \nGo check it out and hit that subscribe button!  xoxo Sarina 😊 \n\nhttps://youtu.be/DcJk32AJckg
She's ugly.
I think everyone agrees she's one of the ugliest actresses ever 💯😎
Damn how desperate for 'drama' is he to ask a irrelevent stupid question!!Never mind the person making a career out of bashing old partners/friends..
She might not have that scarf but she sure has the face of a hound dog ...😕😕😕😕
Maggie Gyllenhaal is one of Hollywoods ugliest celebrities.  Proof that you don't need talent or good looks to become famous, just Jewish connections.
WHY DON'T YOU AFRICAN FOLKS GET BACK TO AFRICA AND SPEAK YOUR OWN AFRICAN LANGUAGES AND LIVE WHERE YOU BELONG AND LEAVE US CAUCASIAN PEOPLE AND OUR ENGLISH LANGUAGE ALONE AND GO FUCK YOURSELVES! GO MIND YOUR OWN AFRICAN BUSINESS IN AFRICA LIKE THE ASIANS MIND THEIR OWN BUSINESS IN ASIA LEAVE CAUCASIAN WHITE PEOPLES ALONE. GO HOME. GO MAKE SOME POP AND RAP MUSIC IN YOUR OWN AFRICAN LANGUAGES IN AFRICA YOU MUDDAFUCKAS!
Hey I hope you enjoy this new video! Some 370 of you got to see this early as I accidentally pressed the button that I didn't mean to press so the video was live for about a minute this morning, but here's the real version!\n\nMake sure to check out Squarespace because this video *literally* would not have happened without their support.
This is only really an American problem,  no where else was the 757 as popular. Everywhere else they don't need this place type in the world and is why neither Boeing or Airbus have created a new type. And lets be honest, long haul travel in a single isle plane is terrible.
pilots will always be there incase the system fails, and on average they fly about 5 minutes w/o auto pilots, and some of the newer planes can land them selfs
As long as they don't remove the sound, i'm fine with it.
the plane of the future will carry 500-600 people on average, without seats. more like a subway car. there will be a few seats but they will cost 2-10x what standing room will cost. flights will on the whole be 30% slower but the loading and unloading time will be so long it won't matter.
Teleporters would put all airlines out of business
No word on thec chineese Comac? Feels like they are going to have an impact on the market simply by state subsidy..
Preparing for a world without oil??? your kidding right? or at the very least ill informed. Have you never heard of algae oil? It has already flown.
what do i do with this information
Small plane commuting doesn't seem like it can take off. Airports are designed to process very high amounts of people who easily have an hour to get through security. Also, you need public transport just to reach the airport. To commute by plane, you would need to reshape the world and city layouts.
Jet of the future a fighter jet that a kill anything all the way around the world and it doesn't Evan have to take off jet of the juture
Trains cheaper than planes for 200-400 miles? Really.  Check prices of budget airlines in the UK from London->Scotland and the comparable train prices!
Seaweed is being used to create fuel which seems as good as I expected
the problem with short range domestic flights is that you aways have to add check-ins, security procedures and travelling back and forth from the airport. trains will never have this problem.\n\nto bring an example, take to Rome-Milan route (assuming you destination is Milan central station):\n1)by train you have to go to the station (which takes 20 to 40 minutes by metro) 10 minutes before departue, then it's 3:20 or 2:55 hours (depending on the train) to arrive at Milan central station \n2)by plane: go to the airport (at least 40 minutes), go trough security check (10 to 20 minutes), be borded (30-40 minutes), fly (50 minutes), exit the plane and go to the central station (30 to 50 or more minutes depending on which aiport and traffic).\n\nfinal time: \ntrain: 4 hours on average\nplane: 3:20 hours (assuming you do everything with little spare time)\n\nif they can't reduce boarding times and stuff like that it's unikly they'll ever compete with the train
If solar panels became super efficient, they could build an airliner that has really long range. In fact, it would just keep flying, following the sun. Then they could load and unload passengers like aerial refueling. That's the future!!!!
Nice video
BAD YOUTUBE ... WHY DID YOU UNSUB ME !
Need help editing your academic writing? Visit here: bit.ly/edit1000
ah cool saw clip of N323AS getting refueled. Iv been on that plane before!
I would say the A350 XWB would be a great replacement for the 757 ? efficient, has a massive range and can carry enough passengers to make it worth while .
I'm not quite sure, after doing very little research, if they have chosen an engine provider for this design. I work for an aviation company as a tube fabricator and I believe that ultimately Boeing will go with the more well known product. Our market share is and will continue to grow. The Paris Air Show was a huge success for us, and our demand is through the roof. Everybody has to travel...
0:33 bitch be texting for then 50 minutes
Lol the train from London to Edinburgh is both more expensive and less convenient than flying. That's why I chose the BA flight for a recent trip. Flyby may have been even faster, but BA is so much nicer.
I'm not sure we have 15-20 years left.
Regional flights might be quicker....but air security will take you about an hour of your time. 30 minute flight + 1 hour at security. No...I'd rather take the train.
All Airbus needs to do is to release an A310neo and Boeing 797 will be *cooked*.
I just checked the times for the BA A320 flight from Edinburgh to London and the same flight for Fly Be with their D8D. TIme is the same about 65-70 minutes for BOTH. So you are lying. You simply cant compare it this way. Planes dont fly at maximum speed they have cruising speed. Moreover on this specific flight D8D reaches usually cruising altitude of 25000 feet while A320 BA reaches cruising altitude of 33 000 feet. Different cruising altitude in this case is there for better fuel efficiency of both planes. While D8D uses the 25 000 feet as the maximum altitude the Airbus goes higher to achieve better fuel efficiency. And finally on such a short flight it is obvious that the Airbus wont be there much earlier because of earlier descent and on such a short flight you cant see the difference even though the Airbus cruises about 200-250km/h faster than D8D.\nThree of your last videos are really meh...
Do a video about concept planes such as the x-57 Maxwell and the Boeing Blended Wing body and their potential impact on the industry
When you're talking about trains and electric planes, you have to consider that the American train system is awful everywhere else than the Northeast, so they could potentially dominate the market in the Western united States
I always love seeing my old co-worker Dennis on these videos fueling airplanes.
Wouldn't an A330 or perhaps an A321 be considered a similar replacement for the ageing 757's? I get that it's a different manufacturer and therefore added base costs on maintenance but it's still  a viable option, no?
I think there is too much overlap between capacities and sizes even today, why not just use a 787-8 and carry less fuel?
Short distances the high speed train will always win door to door due the time you have to spend at airports before and after flying and the location of airports outside major cities. For example center of London to center of Paris on Eurostar is 2 hrs 16 min.  Flight time London to Paris is 1hr 20 min plus getting to and from the airports, Plus booking in and security.
United Airlines is plane boring. Also, there is no such thing as a 797. Nothing beats the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
I wonder if soon flying across the Atlantic may become cheaper than $200
You never mentioned the Boeing 747-40, which I am told is dying out, even though I still see loads of them at all of the airports I go to. Can someone elaborate on this please?
Short-haul flight doesn't make a lot of sense... if the city doesn't have a small, more accessible airport.\n\nAnyone who has commuted from London to Heathrow, from NYC to JFK knows that. The commute itself is almost 1 hour with another 1.5 hour check-in time.
Isn't the plane of the future just a car or did we give up on the whole flying car thing?
Wow, Boeing is building a new cattle car for the sky! YAY!
Umm...planes are already cheaper than buses in a lot of markets
This is a similar thing they said about the Concorde, which could travel 2x the speed of light
Are aircraft manufacturers ever again going to build a plane that doesn't look like a facsimile of the 737.... ever??
Edinburgh to London is far cheaper to fly, the state of trains in the UK is abysmal.
The plausibility of electric transports has to be considered in question until it is proven not. The most plausible version of the idea, I suppose, is a fuel cell, but a fuel cell does not eliminate the need to carry the fuel necessary to support powered flight. I am not sure about the idea of short haul airplanes replacing the train. The airport has to be gotten to and there has to be screening and boarding. All of this means the process of flying inevitably has to be extremely time consuming even if the time in the air is brief. Boarding an intercity train, even for a trip of some hours, need not be more complicated than boarding a bus or a commuter train. The problem with the train, at least in the United States, is that issue of providing short and medium haul train service is tied to plethora of hobbyhorse issues, notably the idea of downtown-to-downtown service. The problem is, downtowns have their drawbacks. They are often are congested and hard to get into and out of and that they may no longer have the infrastructure necessary to provide for the needs of travelers, especially accommodations and car rental.\n\nThe state of California, where I live, right now is spending tens of billions of dollars building a high speed rail line through rural Central California which most likely will end of being a train to nowhere for many decades to come. In reality, the state could set up commuter-grade service between Los Angeles and the Bay Area with stops in San Jose, Salinas, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ventura and Burbank within literal weeks if the will was there. Notably, all accommodations would be available on both ends of the run due to proximity to already operating airports. No, I don't think short haul airplanes are a real competitor to trains, provided the trains are sited properly. At or near airports or in suburban locations would be better options for the end terminals that this downtown-to-downtown idiocy. In between, the existing terminals of the smaller cities would be adequate. VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) could change this picture somewhat, but it could be pricey and an option only for the high end traveler.
Boeing 777 X don't fail me now!
The airliner of the future will be a single engine powered aircraft. It will start life as a short distance carrier over land in order to prove its viability/safety/reliability but will eventually gain some kind of an TESOPS  ( The Engine Spins Or People Swin )rating allowing it to travel great distances over water just as the twin engine powered airliners of today proved themselves.
Well from what I have seen much lighter carbon fibre composite planes with much improved engine efficiency and wing span profile improvements are fast approaching are set to be the the next step in aviation advancement.\n\nTho I think we should also look at having hybrid solar planes... we already have light aircraft making use of solar tech and much more efficient solar panel tech on the way.
Can you please make a video about how flights get their flight numbers.
find your airline videos rather insightful, if you ever have time any idea what happens to flights when they get disrupted from hurricanes? because that throws airlines into chaos
You forgot about the A321LR... It has the range of a 757, maybe even more, and seats approx. 200
we never say that word united
Wendover Productions? More like Bendover Productions. Just like that and you're a subsidiary of Brazzers well done 👍
Wait, so Airbus already has a 757 competitor? And nobody's buying it? That makes no sense.
SOOOOOOO Much Boeing bias in this video! Lots more companies then Boeing, you have Airbus, Bombardier and more!
Do a video tackling the gulf carriers!
The video is phenomenal. Thank you!\n\nIt is phenomenal even you said electric motors are weak. They are the most powerful motors ever created ;). In power plants 3 turbines often move a single electric motor more that 1MW power ;).
never say edinburgh again please
Damn, I clicked on this hoping to be watching a video full of those planes in the beginning of the video, but this is so.. real..  It's like clicking on a video called The Car of the Future and the video goes into depth on the 2019 Toyota Camry. Yes, I guess that is technically the future, but it's not future enough, and it's pretty boring.
Over here in the UK train tickets are so expensive that it is often cheaper to fly. Or people just take a coach which is dirt cheap.
Train prices in the UK are ballooning so much that in some routes I've travelled it's cheaper already by the plane.\nFlybe Manchester to Southampton for instance.
May I know where the source list is?
I hate to burst your bubble, but trains tickets will always be cheaper than train tickets, because more customers will be en route, at ANY given time on a train route, compared to an airplane route.  Higher turnover means more $ for the company, and lower costing tickets...
European aviation channels typically talk about Airbus, just as Americans typically talk about Boeing. Do any of you people THINK before you complain or does it just come naturally to bitch about the most trivial shit?
Planes will have to become electric in the next 50 years because we're gonna run out of oil. The future is exciting, who will make the best electric planes? Tesla??
This channel is getting known, Wendover! I knew it would blow up. Keep up the great work :)
So the 797 is essentially a redesigned, revamped 767?
I'm surprised you didn't mention how the 757 market is now shifting towards freighters in order to account for the more modern aircraft that airlines are using. I'm not a betting man, but I would be willing to lay my chips down on the fact that more 757s are freighters than they are passenger aircraft these days.
The plane of the future needs everything you said in the beginning except for personal jets for everyone. For 200. dollars you can go anywhere in the world in 1-4 hrs on the plane of the future. Now what we need is trains of the future.
Fuck I want a plane
Need hypersonic aircraft
3:09 twin|aisle aircraft
lol hyperloop
Nerd!!
Det här är en riktigt bra och informativ video. Tack.

Is it the C172
BOEING BOEING BOEING .... dislike
FUUTTUUREE!!!!
Electric ones or hydrogen
2:90 the 777x
Hyperloop
How about the A350-900???🤔🤔
did you seriously just mention the hyperloop? LOL
The 787 is the Middle Spot aircraft it is for long skinny routes. The 787 was created just to replace 757, not the 777. The 737 MAX was not made to replace the 757. It's purpose is to refresh the 737 series. The 797 will be a high capacity short range aircraft for routes such as New York to Los Angeles, and New York to Chicago. There is no need for electric aircraft at this point, we still have enough gas at this point to have no demand for an electric aircraft. Plus switching to electric would be a huge fundamental change in aviation no one was asking for. The a350 and the 787 will be sufficient for the next 20-50 years.
Why theres no 777?
I expected better from the Boeing 797. Also, who's a Boeing fan?
I feel like this video was a bit boeing biased.
biased..
Boeing fan I smell
Im suprised people still fly united.
What about the CSeries (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_CSeries) from Bombardier?
Airbus a321ER?
THIS VIDEO WOULD BE BETTER IF YOU WERENT SUCH AN AMERICAN ASSHOLE SPEAKING OF BOEING ONLY. Best regards from the rest of the fucking world.
electric aircraft is like cold fusion. NEVER GONNA HAPPEN!
But airbus 350 is the most fuel efficient now...
lol dont worry, hyperloop is NOT a threat to any transportation.
A321 will fill this gap. The A320 was designed to have bigger capacity and longer range than the 737. The 737 Max is exactly that - maxed, can be made no larger, it's already a freak as it is and that's why it's not selling. The A320 can be easily stretched to create an A321 Neo.
Electric airliners?\n\nHahahahahahahahahahaha.
It's alright for Juncker. He's an old man! He can create this shit for a considerable percentage of the world's population, take the money and enjoy it for his last remaining few years. Everybody else is screwed! Why would ANY country want ANY of that shit!?
6k views... how is this trending?
Saying it as it is !!
I love Brexiting, I am delighted to be getting away from this horrible shower of Cunts.\nThe pain and unhappyness that has been caused to Remoaners, has also been of great delight to me.
Brexit has been a disaster.
LOL he is right though, i wish we just did a hard brexit and pay no divorce fee at all, screw them we can trade with every were else.
If you had given Cameron concessions, the brexit vote would never ever have happened Or if David Cameron weren't a self interested twat lmao
Thankfully soon we will no longer have to listen to him.
Comparing the EU to Eastern Europe under the Soviets is actually disgusting. People were massacred in their droves, Matyas Rakosi, the first Communist Leader of Hungary is known as the Bald Butcher. People were starving while grain was being sent to the USSR. The cunt needs to get his head out his arse and not chat complete shit. Imagine if he'd said the same thing about Germany but comparing their current economic status with what they had under Fascism?
Juncker, the drunk junkie, wants all the toys. So he can break them, when he feels like it.
pure scum talking rubbish! which school he attended this cunt?
Well said Farage 👍
Any guesses when the next EU bailout will be?\n\nWill it be Greece or Italy?
We need other countries in Europe who want to leave the EU to stand up, and take action!\n\nBe proud of your unique history, and its culture.
A little history lesson for you the majority of the British government never wanted to be part of the EU in the first place it was the conservatives who wanted it and went out of their way to invest money into the EU project. the conservatives were voted out and labor stepped in wanting to back away but because we had already invested so much into the EU we were to prideful to just walk away partly due to the money and partly because of the absolutely disgusting (and very typical) attitude of the french towards us at the time an attitude which has never changed. We stayed with the eu despite this but made referendums to our membership one thing that was universally agreed on was the retention of the pound sterling as throwing everything into the euro wold have been stupid, this later turned out to be accurate. anyhooo timeline\n\nThe United Kingdom made its first application to join in 1961. It was quickly apparent that there was a danger of political isolation within Western Europe, Commonwealth states were rushing to do deals with the new bloc, and it had American support. This application was vetoed by the French Government in 1963 with a second application vetoed by the French again in 1967. It was only in 1969 that the green light was given to negotiations for British membership. The United Kingdom joined the European Economic Community (as it then was) on 1 January 1973 with Denmark and Ireland. This proved controversial at the time. The Labour party initially sought renegotiation of membership. This was toned down to requiring a referendum on whether the United Kingdom should remain part of the Community. This referendum was duly held in 1975 with a 67% vote in favour of continued membership.
What an hypocrite, he acts as he cares of East Europeans, after his Brexit polish & East Eu were first to be attacked by him Nigel farrage Brexiteers supporters, and now most polish and east Eu are preparing to leave as there no promise for them of staying except fake sweet promises
They are utter fanatical maniacs.\n\nI think a spirit of delusion has entered them.\n\nThey remind my of the verse\n\nThen entered Satan into Judas, and from that time he sought an occasion to betray Jesus.
UB burst looks like mr. DNA from Jurassic park
Im going to name assembly trumps wall.
UB Assembly is Trump's favorite Pokémon lol
WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A WALL FOR THOSE LUDICOLOS
Does this mean Togedemauro and Mimikyu also get a Z Move
UB Assembly will build a wall to protect us from those Ash-Greninja spammers
Burst is my favorite ultra beast now
UB Assembly adds a whole new meaning to 'Wall'. Things gonna have over 200 Defense and maybe even Special Defense.
Nilhilego with hands and legs
AAAAAAAAAAAAA I'M SO HYPED! IDC IF YOU GUYS DISAGREE THIS IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE
I feel like my dude Assembly is gonna right Guzzlord's wrongs.
Here’s everyone’s Dawn Lycanro.......\n\n\n\n\nNever mind
Ultra Burst is cool
What's happening to Pokemon
Hey we can SOS hunt Mienfoo in Pokémon USUM cool
How early should i purchase the game to get that rockruff?
Am I the only one who sees UB Assembly and thinks It's the.... UNKNOWN
I think I've seen these ultra beasts before I think I had desia vu
Is it just me, or does anyone get some Shadow of the Colossus vibes from UB Assembly?
Here before this goes viral!
Assembly will probably have OP defense
omg 😱 i cant wait to capture the ultra beast so psyched
Lego for the win 🔥
IT HAD A ZMOVE THIS WHOLE TIME
UB assembly and Gumshoos are going to be gooood friends
ALL I WANT IS ALOLAN PARASECT PLEASE
Hey Ultra Moon future byuers, you will get yourselves a Guardian of Breathe of the Wild as a slave while us will have It
Just saw the trailer omg great thing are gonna happen in USUM
Yessss we finally get the game on the same day as everyone else 😁
UB burst is a clown disco ball.
The new Ultra Beasts look amazing!!!
omg i want this so bad!!!!!1!!11!
Holy moly, I would like to have UB Burst
0:29 looks like we might be able to catch mienfoo in Ultra SM
Who is looking at this comment?
The character just smiles while doing z moves Oh I just love destroying innocent pokemon
Ok..... well I did not think we would see more ultra beasts but ok.... loving the necrozma fusions though
1:46 *DAB*
EARLY
UB assembly lol inside is donald trump
Pokemon ultra moon: ASSEMBLY REQUIRED
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
YO
The clown looks so cooooll!!!!!!!
Still nothing about pokewalk :(
Omg I'm dying
Hyped!
Alolan Muk bred with Niheligo to create UB Burst
WHERE'S MY ZMOVE
New Ultra Beasts like UB assembly *trump breathes heavily*
Honestly I hate these ultra beasts
ad revenue
So hyped can't wait😆
😍😜😘😝😀😁😂
burst is cool
Do UB Leviathan! Thats my...idea..well
So scary eye wall, and...firework jester? ....hm....ok! :D
So Sick!
0:42 isnt that i choose you hat?
23rd m8 but 8n't no 1 care. Dont like this comment
Please extend the Rockruff event because I am getting the game for my birthday and it's in December.
I love the new ultra beast. Burst is weird, assembly isn't.
New Pokemon:\nA square\nNihilego's creepy brother
Pokemon Sun 2 and Moon 2.
Honestly that clown ultra beast may be my new favourite Pokemon
UB ASSEMBLY is a Minecraft Ultra Beast we are going to THE END confirmed in USUM\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a Joke btw
I need more information about how to evolve rockruff into Dusk form
Assembly is rock-ghost
Everyone's on about the UBs, but Splintered Stormshards.
This is weird, but I love how the text doesn't just appear on screen. Also does purchasing early mean preordering or getting it as soon as it comes out?
Yo, but is that UB Burst a disco ball?
what is this are they running out of ideas
WHY DIDN'T THEY JUST INTRODUCE NECROZMA IN THIS GAME
I WAS the 2nd viewer
and first to thumbs up
Don't care about UBs or Necrozma. Give me an offensively built alolan Lapras, possibly with a brand new pre evolution for it, maybe even just do a Gardevoir and Gallade style evolution wherein a male Lapras is a new pokemon entirely.\nGive me a way to get Dusk Lycanroc using my own rockruff so I can breed it it with a good movepool, nature and stats, rather then some randomised one off Rockruff.\nAdd some 6vs6 random battles to the online- 3vs3 can be a 'quick battle' side option so that those who like 3vs3 over 6vs6 arent left out.\nNew Eeveelutions for my boy Eevee! Including a normal type evolution because base eevee- even with a z-move, just aint the same. We need a ghost, rock, ground, bug, flying, fighting, dragon, steel and poison types! Why you slacking Gamefreak?!? You started this thing, and even gave fairy a eeveelution- finish it.
You need to give lucario a z move plszzzssszzzzzzz😭😭
I love how they think we know nothing about necrozma so they tell us what we know from a year ago
The move UB assembly uses at 1:41 is iron defence. Not any exclusive move or anything.
YAS QUEEN UB Burst is fabulous!\n\nCalling Bug/Psychic on it.
Do people still think this game is going to be bad?
hating these ultra beasts already...
40th
Omg !!!
7th
13th
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Hope UB:assembly can learn fissure

Awesome review. I love the chat about other dark skin ladies getting color matched Love it xoxoOh NEW SUBBIE
You're so beautiful 🌺
She hit 300k at he beginning now she has over 400k
You keep your foundations on the shelf, thats so cute 💕😩
Thanks for this review!💕
Her skin. Amazing. That's it.
Not sure if anyone else has made mention of this but literally any sponge would soak up the foundation like that if you haven't blended it in just a little first. Great video though.
Looks beautiful on you
she deserves a lot more then 300k...
Do Apdg's foundation it has a very wide shade range. https://www.apdg.co/foundation-concealer/
You have the most beautiful skin &skin color girl super flawless 😍
You have such a beautiful smile <3
I love your skin colour
Your skin is the most beautiful thing I have EVER seen. This review was awesome!
You are so pretty! I have seen videos of you before but never subscribed (why?) but I did now! I love your personality, you are so genuine and have a positive attitude 😊
That clock is so sick! Your skin is so glowy! Love, love, love.

Your skin is so beautiful you don't need foundation \nI wish I had this even skin
Love you girl thankyou for the review 💜
I thought you had the foundation on AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS VIDEO.. your skin is just waow
Beautiful and your comment section is worth reading! Keep it up:)
btw you convinced me to buy the brush haha
I really don't know the foundation oxidized darker than your neck area because i noticed in this video that your face is quite darker than your neck area. Or maybe it's the way it looks to viewers
Your skin awwww so glowing and healthy, u dont need anything to cover imperfection because ur skin just sooo asdfghjkl beautiful <3 <3
Wow you're so beautiful! Literally glowing ♥️
Holy crap your skin is gorgeous dahling!!! You are so beautiful!
Wow I've never seen someone with such glowing beautiful skin!! You are beautiful!!
you are Gorgeous hunnie i love you
For everyone who is new here, welcome!! ❤️
Wow, you look like you are made of satin or velvet, so gorgeous, a goddess!
your reaction is so real and i love that you experienced seeing other deep dark complexion women at the store finding something that actually works and looks good!. Im medium toned and am the darkest or second to darkest shade a lot of times (if they even carry a shade dark enough) and its just disheartening to think how hard it is for my darker friends. and your skin was glowing before application like holy crap, girl. stay flawless. i just subscribed.
you are so beautiful!!!
BEST foundation color for your skin yet 💖💖🙌🙌🙌🙌 ok ri
You don't even need makeup. You look pretty flawless on camera...
You are so beautiful 😍
Please review APDG's darkest long wear pigment! I've heard a lot of positive things from others about that brand, and would love for you to critique it yourself ❤️
STUNNING, STUNNING!! You are a GODDESS!! Just subscribed!
Just wanna say, you are absolutely stunning.  Your skin tone is so beautiful and your complexion is so smooth.  At the beginning of the video I wasn't sure if you were already wearing the foundation.  This is a great review.  Also really love your review of the trophy wife highlighter and the match stixs, which look amazing on your skin, you clearly know your makeup and what will work best for you. Love it xxxxx
Your skin is so beautiful you don't even need foundation! Thank you for doing the review. I will be trying Fenty Beauty!
I'm gonna try her foundation the fact there is so many shades I love o have the weirdest skin tone like a yellow green lol
I do notice all the foundations provided have so so much red in them. It still looks good on Nyma Tang but her skin is so beautiful and cool. I wish someone made a cooler shade that is dark enough for her. That Lancome looks dope though. I should watch that vid and see what she thinks.\nHey Nyma, how did the blotting primer make your skin feel?  Do you think it could clog pores?
First time viewing your channel.. and GURL.. OMG.. I am dying.. your beautiful dark skin is AMAZING. I'm a chocolate gal and could lay out in the sun all day in the hopes that my skin would be as dark and beautiful as yours, and I'd not get anywhere near how beautiful you are! You are STUNNING! I adore you for this channel.. Thank you!!!
hiiii Manu. im Allison Vides from Ecuador. i'd loooove to win coz who dont want?  i got excited with all fenty beauty products!!! and its difficult to get here. my ig : @amnotally
Im white as a ghost but still watching 🤔
girl you have amazing skin without makeup
I'm happy riri did it for the bomb ass chocolate women ❤️its fucking about time for darker shades.
I wanting this video I am thinking stunning and you skin is flewless with out makeup I can't wait to see the finale results
Personally, I think girls w dark complexion don't need foundation their skin is really nice already w their melanin
why do some youtubers make their intros looooong?(I'm 9 please explain)
All thanks goes to RiRi for finally letting dark skinned women feel extremely comfortable and gorgeous in their own skin! :D
I'm spanish so my words dosen't correct please tell my and sorry 😅 I don't, set up?. I don't set up that you only have 400.000 subs, si very strange! Your Voice and you skin ser very beautifull. You are  beautifull!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️

Nyma you are literally the cutest and the most beautiful girl \ni've ever seen like i wanna hug you for how cute you are omg

You are so beautiful 😍
You're skin is beautiful
You are so beautiful
You have such a gorgeous, glowing completion!! Love your videos xxx
I have really really pale skin and I struggled to find my shade of foundation and concealer because most foundations on my skin make me look like Donald Trump. I respect Rihanna for making so many shades. When I go to the drug store I never see shades like your skin tone. They're all just medium skin tone.
i honestly found your voice so soothing and calming
The blotting powder did really good!!
Your skin glow, guuuuuuurrrrrllllllll 😍❤️
Ur voice is so comforting
❤
You are gorgeous!

She doesnt need make up
so beautiful! x
You're pretty
Her skin is FLAWLESS
You are beautiful 😍😍😍😍
you are stunning!
Woah I hella thought she had foundation on in the beginning 😳
What's really respectable is she only talked about rejecting her writing credit for one of her biggest hits (My Life Would Suck) because she was directly asked about it, she wasn't trying to brag or show off but just bring light to an issue that is very important and relevant in the music world.
Kelly Clarkson didn't want her name near Dr. Luke. So she lost out on thousands maybe even millions for her writing credit. That speaks volumes!👌🏼
9:10 Dr. Luke's part
Amazing woman! Her ideals are really strong.
I love you Kelly.
Kellegendary Clarkslay. Classy woman. So sincere. I love that she answered the Dr. Luke question, most people would've dodged it.
I love how she was asking if the host's dad is ok after the cancer. Shows she really cares about people even interviewers and not just focusing on talking about herself! :)
kelly is a motherfucking womam!!!
Mad respect for her.
Whoah! I'm too early!\nFirst comment? LOL\n\nKelly though...this was a fun interview and I love Kelly so much!
Yasss miss kelly we stan
I admire the fact that she said singers change an existing  song slightly and then will request a writing credit on a song which implies to the listener that they may have had a bigger part in writing the song than they actually did. I've listened to so many songs with artists having their  name in the writing credits and  years later I hear the recorded demo of the song with the true writer.
Kelly is incredibly talented, classy, modest, gorgeous woman, and this is where I could continue, but.... Thank you for being honest about Idol and Dr Luke
i really enjoy this radio host- this is the first time i've heard of him (im australian) and honestly i've never seen someone so interested and whole-heartedly enthusiastic about his job or his opinions or anything like that. props to you dude
She is such an amazing person. My favorite singer EVER!
I have always liked her
i can see she is secret bff with Adele
Kelly is all american dream!
RIP Eric the Actor
Love her!
Why didn't she take the writing credit and just donate the proceeds to charity? Instead the money just went to Dr. Luke and/or her label...
Fat
@3:35 What is that melody or where is from?
Can we say the same thing about music? Is listening to my favorite music regardless of the instrument used while meditating / doing a introspection corrupting my thoughts or real feelings, like thinking about the sad things that happened to me while listening a happy song distort the insight on what a feel. Is music acting like a scapegoat for my darkest thoughts?
I think the problem doesn't exactly lay on the phones or advanced capitalism, but rather on our lack of struggle to achieve balance.
The more advance phones get, the more damage it inflicts on us internally.
Come home to the impossible taste of your own completion. Come home to Simple Rick's
LoL, really? I pity the society you live in. There's  plus side to living in a small town with a library and nice cafes in it, I guess. And educated, communicative humans that also really rarely use their phones.
Watched this on my phone laughing
Humans are learning machines, the more you put in the more come out. First we learn how to learn, than we learn. Our phones, and computers in general, are such amazing machines. We can choose how much we learn and What we want to learn. I have so many times found myself just googling for hours on my phone or computer. And after that, I just close my computer and close that book with it. But a few days later, when I'm just bycicling to school or What ever, the puzzle Parts from the googling sessions falls together making the big picture look a bit more clearer. We live in an amazing time where knowledge is so close to billions of people. It's how you use your devices. A book, a dvd-player, mp3-player, phone, letter. It is all 1 device now and that's why it looks like Everyone is addicted. Nothing has changed except that 1 device rules it all instead of 20.
I need an exorcism of this smartphone that's making me stupid.
*Logs on Youtube*\n*Watches this video*\n*Logs off Youtube*
Geez this channel can be very pessimistic
I'm happy when my flip phone doesn't go off in a day
or we're just bored
but what about my memes
Thanks \nI won't use my phone that much anymore
Problems with phones...\n   They're not substancial enough to drive nails or screws...\n   They don't come with attachments to remove pet hair or get a damn thing out of A/C vents...\n    Not aerodynamic AT ALL...\n    They make a terrible sound and start smoking when you piss in them...\n    They don't run on water... (or under it apparently)...\n    They seem to HATE ice cream...\n    Sure, they're a perfect window to all the knowledge, technology, and skills around the world... until you actually NEED it (like a real emergency)... and then you can't connect either! So... you're still on your own.\n    They don't handle well in the snow...\n    They don't deal with sand or heat very well...\n    Absolutely no personal common sense at all... (smart? pah... it's as dumb as a rock)\n    Lazy... These things... All they do is make noise and flashy lights. They lay about BEGGING for attention, and once you get started giving in to that... It just NEVER f***ing ends!\n    Delicate... Go ahead, keep it in your back pocket and forget it when you sit down... GO AHEAD!\n    They can't drive. Navigation aids are great and all, but you know what else is great? A F***ing MAP!\n     They taste like SH*T! Even if there was any nutritional value (there isn't) it isn't worth trying.\n      They're expensive as F***! Can you believe that price? Honestly, for that kind of price on a damn phone, it should have a hooker paid for a year IN FULL to play with my n**s whenever I'm using it!\n     Irresponsible...Just leave the phone (smart, my ass) in charge of your house for a week and SEE WHAT HAPPENS... hope you don't have pets if you try this...\n     \n    Now, you might argue that not everything in this list has something to do with the so-called Intended use or application of a phone... BUT it's supposed to be a smart phone, so it should surely be able to score something somewhere... It's supposed to be multi-purpose but that just doesn't seem to fit either... Think about that. :o)
only after looking this video，I realised that I had been kidnapped by my phone for a long time!
What about pictures, talking to loved ones, podcasts, music, apps like Cracked, etc.\nNo everyone is addicted.\nBut, yes they are primitive.\nNext step is VR.
I still don't have one and I will never want one!
independance is what makes us self suifficent. dependance is like having no own opinion (self) and therefor letting other people decide what happens with you.\n\nWith phones, the people who make the phones.
will be great how to use a phone like we use land line
Every one of these videos is an existential crisis waiting to happen
Sorry, but I'm calling bullshit on this one.\nThe human race has had tens of thousands of years to improve morally, and it never happens. We are closer than ever to annihilating the planet and everything on it. We are bored, lonely, and ignorant: A cellphone removes all that anxiety and suffering. It cancels the many unbearable hours we must spend waiting -- in the doctor's office, in the dentist's office, for a cab, for a movie to start, etc. It's the best invention ever. It's your mind's friend, teacher, and counselor; for instance, on Amazon's website, you get reviews of products. Those reviews have save me from making terrible purchasing decisions, information I can hardly get anywhere else, and certainly not as quickly.\n\nDon't be a Luddite. Embrace and enjoy the latest technological breakthroughs, like CGI movie effects. I remember the old movies and TV; they were in black-and-white and laughably cheesy: Superman would jump through a window and then be seen held up by cables flying faster than a speeding bullet. It was unwatchable then and now. No, you can go back to horse and buggy days if you want, say, join the Amish; not me, my computer gives me countless hours of information, discussion, entertainment, and more. And you don't have to put with endless bores wasting your time telling you how the world is, or that I need Jesus to be happy, or that I need to buy that item now before it's sold out, which it never is.\n\nWe love our technology for a reason: It provides a better life, a more interesting life, a life where you are in charge, rather than being bossed around or led astray. Goodbye 20th century, and good riddance!
We deserve pity for having been born in such primitive times
Phones are not to blame for this condition. The problem is that people suck... and its difficult to relate or form healthy and kind relationship with them.
The problem with our Cell Phones is that they do so much that they suck at making phone calls
they have bad battery life and cost too much, then lenovo made the lenovo P2 and fixed that
some people love their phones so much...they put them up their ass...and have to go to the emergency
So the answer to phone addiction... Is better phones? Hmmm somehow I don't think we need to go deeper into this rabbit hole... It's like saying the answer to coffee that helps us to get things done and stay interested, is meth, which REALLY helps us get things done and stay interested. Phones and computers should be regulated by the government. Sounds crazy but it should be that way. They already have power over us with nuclear weapons and superior firepower. But we are the ones that elect them so in that sense we will always have power over them until. Or do we? Reduce phone usage and we reduce the brainwashing of the internet (through manipulated memes, biased feeds and tailored adverts) and we can elect better government. It's as simple as that. But the government doesn't want us to be out of their grip. Once they had television, now they have internet
why does  school of life hate on capitalism  so much?
louis c k said the same on smart phones
Hey guys, I'm the special snowflake ! I don't have a phone, I only read books, I am very sportly, young, I take care of my nutrition (I only eat vegetables though not being a vegan) ; people think I'm smart and humble !\n\n\n\n\nNah jk im a fat student buddy trying not to spend too much time on videogames and crappy memes
When you look back in your life and remember the happiest moments, do they all have something in common? I thought that probably for most of us,  those were the moments where we felt totally absorbed in something we loved to do, to a point where we forgot about time and about ourselves and everything around ..Like when you get lost in a book, in a piece of music you play or when you feel one with the nature. Or when you get into a deep conversation with a friend, watch a great movie or  a concert...  You get into a kind of flow. \n\nI don't have a smart phone, because I thought it would constantly bring me back to the surface.  And surface is absolutely the place where you suffer the most! Imagine all the situations I described above: A phone that makes strange noises at any unexpected moment would ruin it all. \n\nWell I don't mean to offend anyone, this is just a personal thing and I confess that I have a total  obsession with silence and my phone is turned off 99 percent of the time. \n\nBut here is a quote by Nietzsche that is worth keeping ALWAYS  in mind: \n\nThe greatest events  of our lives - they are not our loudest but our stillest hours”\n\n Imagine that you have your favourite cake in front of you. But if you get lost in some thoughts while eating it, you may suddenly realise that the cake is gone!  You just ate it without even noticing it! ( It happened to me more than once with all sorts of muffins! :- ) \n\n If we spend our counted days on earth with constant distraction, in the end,  we may feel this way about our lives  ... We won't know where it  has gone...\n\nAs T. S. Eliot said: \n\nWe get  distracted from distraction by distraction. \n\nThat's the greatest danger.\n\nI don't mean to sound too dark though. Of course you can have the latest smart phone, in case you REALLY need it, and if you know exactly what you want from it, you can use it properly.\n\nFor friends who want to think more on this issue here is a little list: \n\n1. There is a TED Talk by Adam Alter called: \n\n Why our screens make us less happy. \n\n He is a psychologist and professor at NYU and he says that he himself was \naddicted to his phone and to gaming. Imagine! :- ) That motivated him to write the following book: \n\n Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and The Business of \nKeeping Us Hooked. \n\n2. There is a very interesting  Note to Self podcast episode called: \n\n What is our attention actually worth \n\nIt can be helpful if you want to re-think your relationship with your phone. \n\n3. There is a TED Talk by the  ethical design thinker Tristan Harris called: \n\nHow better tech could protect us from distraction\n\n4.  I haven't read this one but Shery Turkle from MIT has a book on the issue called:\n\n Alone Together, Why we expect more from Techonology and Less From Each Other. \n\nYou can also watch her TED talk:\n\n Connected, but alone ?\n\nThanks for this wonderful lesson and for the amazing animation!
yeah man it's so fucked up how much we rely on our phones \n\nSent from iPhone
I'm so aware of the hold my phone has on me. I consciously put it down sometimes because of this. Yet I'm not giving it up.
We'll evolve as phones evolve into virtual glasses which enhance vision and hearing of things we could not experience in the past.
I'm watching this video on my phone...
Watching this on my phone
Soo who else is watching on..oh\nHeyy good thing i m watching on my ta.. oh taken again..\nI should use my lapt..god damn it!
its sad.. but I'm totaly agree.. the phone now keep all secret.. everthing of us.. who control tecnology today.. can control our mind...
isn't this topic so contradictive, even while you're transferring this video/message, aren't you using the same channels? Aren't you a part of this chaos? Well, anyways...
Still want a new iphone x for myself
What kind of tinder is that?
Just brilliant. Thank you for this insight.
I never feel addicted, is that good?
This true. Watching stuff on my phone to calm down the anxiety caused by waking up for work, forcing myself for a major work that i need to complete, before making  stressful decisions etc. And afterwards, when i get home, i eat to feel the comfort again. Only a thought self therapy can help to reevaluate things and assure myself that these things that cause stress are just everyday tasks like getting dressed.
I somehow one day just switched to a feature phone -  something I could use only for calls and SMSs. This video sounds like an afterthought, but nails the point nonetheless. Do we not realise already that we have come to a point that the cost of carrying smartphones has far exceeded the benefits? The choice - to give up our smartphones or not - is ours, but definitely worth attending to. Most importantly,  I guess a smartphone is a metaphor  for our all-pervading collection of gadgets and even the internet too.
Use the phone as a tool, don't be a tool used by the phone.
One thing I agree about the affect of phones is that they not only prevent us from self-reflecting, but also from being present. Whenever we see or experience something amazing, the first thing that comes to mind is taking a photo of it. For example, after witnessing beautiful scenery in a foreign land, most of us don't even stop to soak it all in. It's almost as if the main reason we went there in the first place was for showing off and taking selfies. We witness a personal favorite actor somewhere and the first thing that pops into mind is taking a photo; not thinking of possible questions to ask if we could. How often do we get to witness these things? Then why do we tend to spend them in such superficial ways? I think it's because we're so confident that we have all of the answers of the world in the palm of our hand (literally) that the only thing we can do is try to prove ourselves to others, missing out on life in the process.
good thing i only use my phone to steal my neighbours wifi to give it to my pc and think about philosophy and science all day
well that was depressing
watching it on my phone and seeing myself in it with every word.\nI think Alanis Morrisette wrote a song about this feeling.
I'm 29 and never had a smart phone . Any one else ?
Interesting stuff as usual. Had me thinking about these new thousand dollar phones. Remember when their primary goal was to communicate with each other? Its funny how we have moved away from that.
I have started leaving my phone indoors... makes a huge difference, takes some getting used to
I don't own a smart phone. I do have a desktop PC through which I access the Internet, though. One of the old, big tower kind. It's distraction enough. :)
No I strongly dislike my phone. I'm paranoid that I might lose it or that it will die because people expect that if they send me a message, that I have been made aware of it's contents.
I try to forget my phone at home once in a while. Very nice message.
because our phones, we can watch videos that tell us to stop using our phones...
Social media is a damn joke.
omg i could listen to him talking about anything and still be interesting
The irony of watching this on a smartphone xD
i am guilty, but at least i was smart enough to realize it rather that denying it.
They're also slowly giving us tumours
Like the idea behind the video, but some premise is worrisome: Yes, we can and must compare the brilliance of our phone with the past. Why? Because our phones are not just devices of despair as some citizen of some first world country would think. They're also the opportunity for most of humanity to catch up, to have access to almost every knowledge of the world, to educate and be better people. It's also gives you the possibility to communicate and not just posting selfies in snapchat, it also gives you the possibility to call your grandma or just to be in touch with people you may not see at any time, because you're poor and you live far.\n\nOf course, there are downsides, but we need to adress them as failure to solve in our long, and continuos (at least for some centuries) technological progress.
Wow! That video was pretty intense! The addiction to phones is definitely self-avoidence for most people... \nMakes me want to go back to 3310 again! :)
I use my phone to watch your vids,which help my self exploration,then contemplate what I learn.\n\nPs. Keep the good work up
Amazing clip. Reminds me of the movie Fight Club what you own ends up owning you.
The funny thing is, my phone has a bed time. By 10pm its away from me! I dont usually sleep till 11pm so for 1 hour I am just in bed being tortured by my own thoughts. The best thing is, I realize what and needs to be done.
Wow. So damn true. May god help us
it look like i am the only person who don't really care about his phone, \nbecause it has no chance to receive any call/message :'(
Ha ha ha I got an add for the Samsung galaxy S just before that
I gave up my phone for 8 hours....When I'm asleep..
I got the same problem, just with my computer instead.
I'm impressed. Good advice
I think I heard a cheeky electronic version of Chopin's Marche Funèbre (Funeral March) at 3:29  ?
How are these made? What software? I love these animations so much.
Ha I thought this video was gonna be about like if there was something wrong with phones physically not like this leave a like if you did too😂\n\nAlso sub please I'm trying to win a bet where you get the most subs without making videos I'm doing the bet with my brother but if you don't want to that's totally fine
This is why i don't use a smartphone ...

You're right

Great content!
my behind stinks
Self-discipline + phone = 💡
Lol nah I just like memes
anti capitalist propaganda
stfu! you make me depressed! -_-
Applause*
Commie piece of shit propaganda.
Thumbs up for spam bot sponge!
4:57 was a bit creepy...
Exceso de información, información que no vas a usar, con algunas excepciones. Solo entra cuando necesites algo muy específico que ya hayas pensado por ti mismo y estaba fuera de tu alcance. La razón esta ahí (en tu cabeza) no en esa maquina todavía imperfecta. Se supone que es una herramienta que te debería ayudar y no esclavizar. \nAhora tendré horarios para encenderlo. Bye
What the fuck was that ending? Our phones should tell us what to think and feel in a utopian future? \n\nBrave new world much?
HA! This was great. I wish we had Panda Express! 😭 Too bad spending $2 on half an avocado seems reasonable when you've been living in Korea and Japan for a long time!
this is the best video ever\nfavorite quote Huh
Hey man, YOU OR YOUR TEAM HAS RAW TALENT!!! SO FUNNY😅😅😅 VERY CREATIVE AND DETAILED. GOD BLESS YOU EVERYBODY👆🌈 i enjoyed very much and your work is very good lol THANK YOU. GOD BLESS.
I feel bad for guys too but I'm exactly that type of girl who will never be satisfied wherever she eats XD
Avocados don't actually contain omega 3's.
Hmm ... Would this be funny if the gender was swapped?
that was really good acting and very funny too do you have more funny videos ?
Ya know, I was going to ditch about a third of the way through but it just started getting so ridiculous I had to see it all the way through.  And I wasn't disappointed - actually LOL'd.
ahahahahhah! I love you're funny short movies! :D
Hamburgers are called hamburgers because they are from Hamburg Germany... which came originally from Mongolia.
omg -_- this is so true.
Wait, that voice... It's Emma! I love you, Joanna Sotomura 😍
We all know Ryan directed this
what was this below-average comedy
i'm hungry
#firstworldproblem
Hah, that avocado line was 100% phil
It's called decision fatigue! Happens always after work at dinner time.
Have I just seen a kind of Sherlock? 😂
It's basic economics 😭😭😭😭😭😭 meeeeeeeeeeee.  And hahaha you know how bad my memory is
Videos like this make me SO glad to be single.\n\n#MGTOW
Lol I'd love to process places to eat using this method with a friend lmao
WHAT IS PHIL SAYING AT 0:15 YA'LL \n\njk edit: after like probably 6 repeats, good work today steve I struggled tho 😂😭😅
Hahaha I was so happy to see Chris but he was so mistreated in this video poor Chris! Love Phil making it so complicated as well.
Pro life tip - whenever you get asked this dumb question, you go to the worst place imaginable. Just pick something she hates and go there and order something she hates to eat\n\nEventually she won't ask this dumb question
When in doubt, choose pizza.
Because this phenomena of getting to choose what to eat is recent. In the past, people ate what they had and acquired what they could, not what they wanted.
This guy could have caught Kira.\nBoth of them.
Is it just me or is this shit boring
4:06 -  You know how bad my memory is \n\nYeaaaah.. Sure haha..
this is effective advertisement right here. My boyfriend and I went to Panda Express immediately after watching this XD
I am just going to get McDonald's
Ugh. I just ate. I can't think about eating more food but I HAVE been craving Panda lately.... Hmm. Maybe just a teensy weensy bit tomorrow.
I feel so bad for Steve er.. Chris lol
I was laughing even before I started watching this video.
L and N have some competition. Light Yagami, watch out.
This video was really dumb. I didn't stop watching it to see if there was a pun at the end but then it just ended. YouTubes been recommending the wrong videos
surprise!!! This is a food kitchen, where all the homeless go, shut up eat your soup!!!
ummm.. could you guys please not compare Wong Fu's video to Ryan's video. It did look similar just because of his way of speaking and explaining while standing, but they put their own hard work into it. They had their own idea. Let's just not put them in an awkward position to reconsider their own ideas by comparing them countless times with Ryan.
This video just proved us that women are so complicated that transformed us men to complicated thing ...
Cool  a lot of fun.  Like. 👍
I love original content :D
You know I have a bad memory
seems like you are spending too much time with Ryan
*he went full Asian* 😂
What the heck's wrong with this guy...trying to be so sweet but not...ah oh!! He just let her girl starve to death guessing..harhar.!Don't ever do that to me dearie! Isn't that clear enough with YOU?
Wong Fu never fails to make me smile and after watching all their videos I be like OMG thats so relatable. Been a fan since long and there hasn't been anything since then which failed to amaze me when it comes to Wong Fu.
So Cathy got married now it's Joannaaaaa
Its so long long time since i see your vid. YOu change alot. LOL Great Job!
I love you Chris!!!! I'll eat with you any day!
The part where Phil says What's BLACK, WHITE, and SOFT? And then it pans to Panda....haha that really got me laughing!
I work at panda express xD
The tyranny of choice. Some people want to maximise every experience unknowingly adding more dissatisfaction to the process. Just name 3 choices and pick the best one and be satisfied with it.
Yeah but im handsome and........ NOT NOW STEVE
now i want panda... but i wont go bc i know they're using their marketing techniques on me!!
I'm honestly not that picky. I should be the one worrying what my boyfriend wants to eat.
For me its super easy i just cook myself and feed myself and others too dont like takeouts ugh
Chris Dinh !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He is such a gentleman. He is a less awkward Ted. More Skits with Chris !!!!!!! please :)
LOL NATALIE TRAN WAS IN THIS
Lol so true!!!

That's my girl....she still got it.!

Her speaking voice reminds me of Mariah Carey's.
I hope wendy if you reading this! I'm your biggest fan! My wish is if you can share my channel or like!
Why they keep changing the songs and intro sequences keep the same ones 😤😤
Im here for cece. Before 7/27/17, i use to watch Wendy williams FAITHFULLY. I needed wendy in my life & clicked on all her notifications. BUT every since the birth of my newborn, I havent had anytime to catch up 😥 its Amazing how i use to live for wendy until my son came into the world, now he be having me up in the strangest hours & sleep mostly in the day. And since that date i havent seen absolutely nothing from WW. But when i saw Cece Peniston? I was like CLICK .LOL. I just had to share that
Great promo.   LOVE me some CeCe -- she is a treasure.
Wait until Monday - this Finally could easily be just Promo for the return - she's had her custom how you doin for her career I doubt she drops the show classic theme song...thats why its a theme song lol...this is just promo work
Cece seems like a genuinely happy person & has a nice personality. Something about her reminds me of Taraji P. Henson.
Cece looks great. She hasn't aged a bit
I'm having a major nostalgia moment. I remember being 9 and dancing around the house to CeCe Peniston's Finally and starting my stuff.
Cece❣️❣️
we know Wendy got that song from watching Rupauls Drag Race lipsync
amber rose record lit in the Caribbean https://soundcloud.com/sevyn47/amber-rose-prod-by-accentbeats
I thought it was the series finale or something.
She's still got it!! Love CeCe
back when real music was still made.
I love CeCe Peniston..... great to see her.
this is my first introduction of her, and i love her already, her voice is so Majestic in my ear, its like the voice of African chanter who pray to the nature
Yaaasss! This song was my jam back in the day, and still is. Cece still has it!
I'm still doing box braids for just $65. No need to buy hair it's already  included for FREE. Save this number to your phone now and forward it to your friends in Houston. Text 24 hours to 713-five-four-eight-3656.
Wendy loves cici. I loved her music  growing up.
Just curious, does anyone know if Wendy started production a week early? Because on twitter I seen recent video's and pics that her studio audience posted from a few days ago.
Cede Peniston's voice is FIRE! Go head girl!
Finally is such a timeless bop
I hear so much Chaka Khanisms in this vocal production that I first I thought it was Miss Chaka herself!
I was obsessed w/ _Finally_ and _Keep on Walkin'._ My lil' friends and I made a step to _Keep on Walkin'._ It was hella cute. I've never invested in a full album though. I'm curious so I will be checkin' on the rest of yo' music, Cece. You can still sing.
She's gorgeous!
J'adore
Cece Bout to be booked n busy 2018 lookin Good

Finally I am so excited.   I love these ladies.  Cece Peniston is BEAUTIFUL!!!. The camera does not doe her justice at all.    I met her once in Chicago. We were standing in Chase bank  inside of the John Hancock where I was working for an advertising company in the building at the time.  She was standing behind me and she ask something and I answered.  I don't remember the question now.  I was shock!  I said your Cece Pippppp. I got her name wrong she corrected so kindly that it was funny.
Love her! Long gone are the days of the powerhouse voices over house beats
Cece P.,  you shoulda Added. Yaaasss  at the end of the song 😁

I came cuz i saw my moms makeup box
I still have my caboodles box, its green and purple. It was filled with lip smackers, scrunchies, nail stickers, and hair clips ❤️  Now its filled with Beyond the zone hair dye and hair tattoos
I was born in 1994 so the last six years of the 90s was my early childhood but I'm a 00's kid really....even though I say I'm a 90s kid at heart. What a fab caboodle!
Wow bunny your make up skills are so much better you look gorges
You remind me of the 90s
The pic of MJ with all the kids 😐
That was the first kind of deodorant I ever used and I still miss it
Pretty sure you'll get your nameplate--the card has social media logos on it so it wasn't printed in the 90s ;)
Omg I want a caboodle! ❤️ can I buy this kit. 💕💕💕
I was so cool with my jelly shoes and my Dr.Pepper lip smackers!! The 90's were the best!!
HOLY CRAB I HAVE THAT EXACT CABODLE AND I WASNT ALIVE IN THE NINETIES
why do i still have my really old caboodle 😂
My mom has the same makeup box
I dont like makeup but....BUNNY, YOUR FACE IS POPPING😍💋💝💎💄👑☺🎅
I like this makeup look, did u contour?
I totally had one of the deodorant
Love the video! But I couldn't stop staring at the tip of your nose.  If your goal was an  extreme makeup look, you nailed it 😅 LOVE YOU
That caboodle isn't vintage tho... I bought myself the same one from Walmart like last month...
Her make up ❤️
OMG I miss the 90s!!! Was born in 1985, the best year to be born ;D
AHHHH butterfly clips!! I lived for them in the late 90's and early 2000's!
OMG !!!! new kids on the block...i love Jordan !!!!!!
You wanna know who Is beautiful\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the first word :-)
My mom has a cubudal exactly the same
Do they make the surprise boxes for sale or was it just PR mail for you?
Omg you have such beautiful eyes again I know I've said it before. But I love your videos you make me laugh and are so relatable.
Honey you can still get caboodles at target and ulta. I dare say that's a newer caboodle tbh.. love ya!
I still have my pink caboodle I got when I was like 7 (I'm 22 now!)
Ur hair in this video 😍😍
Bunny, you should know, I also ate a heap of lip smackers but when I was like five, for no reason, just because.
I was born just outside the 90s but I still watch Rugrats and all those shows😂
I loved Teen Spirit deodorant and the shampoo and conditioner!!! 💕
which lipstick is she wearing?
i use to love teen spirit in strawberry
I had these glitter gels I put on my cheeks and eyes and arms :P I also had a glitter on a brush it would dispense out of the handle haha
My daughter has all those hair pins.
Bunny\nHow did you do your hair?
dude teen spirit is till my go to deodorant since 1994 pink crush is way prettier than powder fresh imho tastes better too :P
I definitely used Teen Spirit! I still have my mood rings, a bunch of those hair clips, Scrunchy's, chockers and my Caboodle that is greenish/blue with the swing outs on top! My favorite other things were Wet N' Wild makeup, those tiny nail polishes, that pink Maybelline mascara and my quad tower of shimmery blue eyeshadow! 💙💙💙
No body glitter 😱😱😱😱
drinking game: everytime she says authentic 90's goodness take a shot
There is a game called logo
they still make this caboodle you can buy it in walmart i bought one a year or two ago for my niece
Thanks for the blast from the past! 👍 one thing I just thought about (when I was 10 or so, in 1992) any body remember Malibu Musk? It was in a lil teal spray can with yellowish flowers on it... Kinda like the designer imposters (remember that? If u love Georgio, you'll love Primo lol) anyway that malibu musk was awesome and I wore it all the time. I wish I could find it again :) btw I still have my purple caboodle from '92, I'll never throw it away!
i got that 2 years ago
can I please have a choker necklace
I have that pink conbutle
So beautiful in this video!!
Haha..i have a caboodle i use for a first aid kit and still to this day using 90s hair ties..u would have a blast😁
Bunny is drop dead gorgeous it's ridiculous!
I have that pink bin
Caboodle still makes boxes and i literally saw the box you have yesterday at Walmart!
I have the exact same make up box
All of that is super fancy i like it😗
I bought my daughter a caboodle last yr at Walmart. They still make them. We actually have the exact same one.
Highlight game is STRONG \n💪🏻🐊🐊🐊💕
I was born in 2004 but honestly I feel like i should have been a 90s kid
Your makeup looks so stunning I absolutely love this look on you. Purple is def your eyeshadow color Bunny!
6:10 when you see a cute guy
I have a 90's green glitter Caboodle! :D
I was born in 97. So its mostly just the late 90's things that carried over into 2000 that I remember. But I feel like Ive mostly just seen the 90's through movies
i was obsessed with lip glosses, there was one that came in a little round tin (it was more like a balm actually) idk what the brand was called but they had flavors like vanilla and watermelon and that stuff was my JAM!
You should TOTALLY curl your hair in plaits like you said you used to! That would be so cool xx
That was so awesome. I knew what deodorant that was going to be, I knew there would be a scrunchie, I knew there had to be a buttery clip, I knew what chapstick it was going to be.... XD That was super fun, Bunny! ❤‍
I have like 15 of those deodorants
Wow, this video made me so happy and nostalgic ☺️
Saw New Kids On the Block and I had IT flashbacks. I'm so afraid
I was born in 2002 so I didn't experience as much as other people who were born in the 90's but I had a small piece of it and those were the best years of my life. Now it just kids sucks cause teens are dressing like young adults and acting like them too.
Bunny what eyelashes are you wearing?
YES MOOREE
i miss american girl doll perfume lmao
August 13th is my birthday lol
The personalized nameplate offer STILL STANDS! I bought a Caboodle a few months ago, and got my very own nameplate. :D
I was born in 2001 and I remember some of this stuff
You look like my best friend in the 90s
I used to eat lip smackers ...🤷🏼‍♀️
I got one of those for Christmas last year😂 it had some nail polish and some other stuff
I STILL USE TEEN SPIRIT!
I was in my teens and early 20's in the 90's. :)
Your hair and makeup! 😍😍😍
I'm a 2000 Baby and I LOVE LOVE LOVE Teen Spirit Deodorant
If you kept nudes in a Caboodle would they be called Caboodz?
I STILL HAVE A TEEN SPIRIT DEODORANT AND I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS FROM THE NINETIES AND I'M FIFTEEN AND I KNOW ENOUGH PEOPLE FROM THE NINETIES AND I HAD PLENTY OF STUFF FROM THE NINETIES SO YES THEY STILL MAKE THEM XD
You can still get Caboodles on Amazon!
I have this box right now.... Omfg
Can you bring back DOES THIS THING REALLY WORK
That caboodle is from 2013
I have that box! I got it yearssss ago, I still have it!
I have that same caboodle rn lol
My Daughter HollyAnna Loves You!  I think Your The BeezeKneeze!
I was alive in the 90's, but I was more of a 90's toddler. However, my older sister was a 90's kid and I remember her having so much of this stuff, and I remember having them myself because I looked up to my sister. My sister still has her caboodle too!
Awww mann.... I was born in 2003... So I have the aftermath of 90's (I wish was in the 90's, it looks so fun.It has more stuff. )
I'm still using a pile of five caboodles\nI'm going to be forty and nothing else satisfies me\nI got mine in the eighties!
I've just gotta say, your look in this video is absolutely gorgeous. like the purple smoked out look makes your blue eyes pop and OMG it's just so pretty 😍
*bought same caboodle at Wal-Mart last month*
I was born in the 80's but grew up in the 90's and the 90's were the BEST! Your totally bringing me back with everything! I used to use the Teen Spirit Deodorant lol thought I was so cool lol also do you remember the perfume Malibu Musk and Old Navy lol! Can you please tell me what lashes your wearing or mascara PLEASE!
walmart still has hard candy make up , i am dying to get some but at $5 a piece ..nope
They need to bring the kaboodle's back permanently. I was born in 1981 and I had an awesome caboodle with stickers and Tattoos all over it.
lmao that box is from walmart haha
I feel so proud of you ... I luv yoouu
I hope they will get to my republic (Czechia) soon, deffinitely gonna be purchasing them both <3

Sooooo happy for you girl!!! You've done a great job! You deserve it!! I'm deffo going to get the highlighting palette! Not sure about the eyeshadow one as I don't really wear it looks lovely though! Lots of love xx
I've been searching for a great drugstore eyeshadow palette. I've probably watched all of your Testing... Makeup. Then i see this video.\nIT LOOKS AMAZING IM SO EXCITED TO TRY IT X
To be fair if these shades weren't created by her she would have negative comments she's only saying this coz it's in her name
I am so happy for you!! They look insane, will be purchasing ASAP
I love how honest u r about the palette, some people would just say it's all amazing but u admit grow old is a bit crumbly 💜
soph is ulta in america going to carry these?
could you do a palette of highlighters that suit people of darker shades
omgg them highighters tho Im in lovee 😍😍
Soph, just a question, have you ever check out the redness on your ears? Are you allergic to those earrings?
But is it gonna be available in the US? 😥

I got my highlighter pallet yesterday and it's great!\nbut they weren't even on the shelves yet and I had to ask of i could get it from the little stack storage thing that workers put up. she was like it's not in the 3 for 2 deal yet and I was like i don't care I just want it now I was supposed to get them both but she didn't understand that I disnt want the deal and I wanted to pay more money so I could get it there and then. I ended up only getting the highlighter because she was in a bad mood.\nnot calling soph here obviously and I doenst matter i can get it tomorrow but oh my gosh that worker. 😢😢\nBtw I was allowed to get it she just wanted me to have the deal when I didn't want it.

Liberals Showing their true colors in the comment section. \n\nHateful, petty, self important, piles of garbage.
Sarah looks like Suh a bitch, like she's been holding a fart and she's just bitter and angry about it
Sarah is typical of all the press secretaries in the past. She often doesn't answer the question people ask and she blindly supports her boss even when she knows it's wrong. \n                She's the newest swamp.
Racist don't like to be called racist.
Trump is a idiot savant when it comes to picking people with no character or ethics to lie for him.
Seeing the media cover a news story about yet another black person calling someone white a white supremacist is like seeing the sun rise in the morning. \n\nThere *WAS* violence on both sides, though. I'm not a Trump supporter, I just live in reality. You're already on YT, so look up antifa comp and/or antifa charlottesville for A LOT of proof.
Let's all defend our racist-in-chief
ooh a little heavy with the contour
Your face is a fireable offense
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
Triggered snowflakes everywhere. Why don't y'all pray for Hill to stop?
Goddamn. The Trumpanzee's are foaming at the mouth triggered over this one!\nLMFAO
Racist Jemele said it because MSNBC, CNN, talk shows, and the rest of the liberal hate-God media says it. They are complicit in the hate.
Yeah ,\nHow many times can the idiot liberal reporter, plug in the word-\nInfluential.\nInfluence who?!\nCertainly not me,\nNor the majority of Americans with half a brain!\nPerhaps just him, with much much less than that!
Both sides keep talking about an African American community as though all black people are mindless zombies who know only how to think one way.  You never hear them talk about a Caucasian American community, do you?
i thought you fucks liked to rant about 'muh free speech' and how words are just words (pewdiepie)....now you bitching and want her fired? Who's the SJWs again???

How does anyone think Trump is competent?
When the right acts like the left we all lose.
That's a woman lol she looka like aman
looking at them ghost skin disease people mad lol
My comment would be,  you can't fix stupidity, especially when poor people are offered a million to be stupid
I thought this administration was a big defender of freedom of speech?  I thought it was only liberals hurt by offensive remarks?  I thought conservatives hate PC culture?\n\nApparently the right is just a bunch of babies who are happy to point out when the left overreacts, but also hate when people point out that they overreact.\n\nI'm sick of all the hypocrisy
Jemele Hill is an influential African American figure\n\nYEAH A GRANDIOSE WAY OF SAYING SHE IS A REPORTER,\n\nshe could be a janitor and you could still use those words influential African American figure yes a great janitor figure one of the best!
This is America world, please read the comments, hypocrisy at its best. The land of the free and the home of the brave🤔. Freedom of speech🤔.
These people see racism everywhere. Nobody but the progdroids listen to them anymore. Very sad.
OMG! Imgine if Jamele had falsely claimed Trump was not born in the U.S!!!
a question that hasn't come out yet.  When did racism or being racist ever become solely and diversely linked to only African American ridicule?  Isn't racism everywhere or better yet, isn't racism conveyed both ways?  Maybe the white majority is too obvious but there a just as many other cultures that frequently hate on another group fueled by international and/or domestic history.  ...
Put your hand upon my hip...when I (Sergio) Dipp you Dipp we Dipp
She is ignorant and was NOT raised properly!  - THAT much is obvious!! She has even spoken about her AWFUL relationship with her mother and Lord knows where her daddy was.
The world is in turmoil and people are losing their lives left and right but I'm a little shithead who only cares about my ratings so I'm asking stupid questions.
I don't like Jemele Hill. I find her frankly annoying. But asking someone to get fired because of a statement is just stupid.
media instigating a race war again
The Huckabee gene is STRONG! Mongoloid-like and STRONG.
You want to hear more outrageous crap? Look up Sarah's father.
If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck.
She got the peoples eyebrow down to the T. The rock would be proud.
In my Katt Williams voice what the fuck is a Huckabee?!😣
The huckabee family protects child molesters and dog killers. Look it up.
Well so what's the problem? Trump is really a racist, and have a lot of racist friends and supporter's. If you support him you may be a racist or a racist sympathizer.
She's a cunt
Since when did just being white make you a white supremacists?
Mn must use mens bathroom. Saying that is a firable offense at ESPN but falsely calling the the President some racist shit is not. You people on the left are textbook definitions of hypocrite, racists,  and pathetic
Pretty simple, I will not watch or support ESPN until they fire the race baiting Jemele Hill.
Sarah has the patience of saint. Admirable.
Sarah Huckabee is an amazing woman. She is so strong and has such character
Sarah Sanders is one classy woman. If I were in her shoes, I'd tear these propagandist a new one, ever single day. I'd come to the podium with stats against their reporting, their networks, their failing railings, their full politi-fact write up, and a record of their continual obsession with false narratives.\n\nEvery sensible person out there who opposed the former president probably wishes they were more vocal about their distain, when they chose to remain respectfully silent (many for the fear of being labeled a racist).\n\nHowever, this past election sounded off to the effect of a nuclear bomb, and somehow, these morons stand around in embarrassment, pretending like they never heard it. That's ok, keep it up! Please, do continue to double down on this failing propaganda tactic...I mean, wonderfully true and reasonable line of logic; I'm sure everyone around the globe agrees. (Snicker)
Wow there's so many people in the comments saying she's so ugly and black  isn't there a word for judge a person solely for their appearance or skin color ... O yeah Progressive
This broad needs to get laid
When will she stop with all the lying?
Why is she so Fat. She looks like that muppets pig
It's only going to get worse. Blacks want everything given to them and get upset when they aren't treated like kangz. Whites need to have each others back and get over any differences they may have. Whites need to stop worrying about being called a racist as it's a hollow attack. Whites need to forget about white guilt - whites built this nation and have given more to minorities than any other race. These people don't want peace, they want everything and they want whites to suffer. Organize. Share the truth and fight back! Be proud of who you are. Get active creating the change you want to see.
She acts as if she doesn't even wanna be there like leave bitch if you don't wanna do your job. Such a cunt.
Lets not forget espn fired rob parker for calling robert griffin a cornball seems to me espb are double standard company
Jemele Hill has been part of what... 3-4 canceled shows?
White peoples response to blacks 10 demands ... FUCK YOU LAZY leech ... X 10
Lol...she has the same look on her face that Spicer had, just before HE GOT LET GO. HA HA
STOP these outrageous and utterly false liberal statements. The left's abject hatred is dividing the country and causing irreparable harm.
TRUMP 2017 MURICAAAA
FUCK Jemele HILL stupid bitch
Eww I hate her unrested left brow
Dumb dun hill.
Didn't Trump call Obama racist?
E
fu*k you snowflakes!
This bitch eyes bothers me. Is one offset from the other? Is it a lazy eye? Too much makeup?
Exactly, why focus on race baters
Whaittt powaaaa!!!
Black Privilege
she just told that dumbass
subcribe to my channel
Sarah Huckabee should be fired.
This admin sucks ass
What a dumb bitch
Trump is a white supremecist
ESPN is racist
dump her like spicer. shes a fucking cunt
SNOWFLAKE. LOL! Triggered ugly bitch.
Liberals Snowflakes ❄️ are TRIGGERED.
Fuck this dumb Bitch and trump
Jemele hill is trash
1) What Jemele Hill tweeted what a large majority of African Americans think. Nothing she said was out of bounds or untrue. \n2) Why is the White House focused on what someone's opinion is? There are far more pressing issues that needs attention.\n3) A fireable offense? She didn't tweet on the behalf of ESPN. She didn't say what she thought on the air. She tweeted from her personal twitter account. Also isn't one of America's foundations freedom of speech?\n\nI have a new found respect for The Six. #iSupport
This is not breaking news.  EVERYBODY knows Trump is a white supremacist...friend with KKK...Kris Kobach of Kansas.
Sarah is by far the worst. I almost miss Spicer. This is the face of nepotism, no talent, no personality, no likability. She always looks tired, bored and stressed. I don't even care what the topic is about she is speaking on.
Tf is up with her masculine ass face, who the hell is this tranny?
I don't watch ESPN anymore because since when is a sports network political TALK ABOUT SPORTS THATS WHAT YOUR THERE FOR like how stupid is ESPN they recently fired a guy for having the last name lee and it was apparently bad bc there was a confederate Robert E lee who was white and the lee on ESPN who was fired was Asian like he should sue ESPN for discrimination over a fucking last name he had no power in picking this is why America is so apart it's bc the liberals purposely do it and then blame us educated people and trump which btw isn't a racist all people who think he is need to get their heads out of there ass bc everything that the liberals use saying he is a racist is so out of context and misleading
Say what you will but shes an excellent press secretary
Jamel hill is a racist no talent hack.
ONLY TROLLS, BELOW, ARE ON  THIS COMMENT PAGE.
I wish she would have just said how about espn sucks our fucking dicks, they are lying scum.
Who the f*ck is Jemele whatever?  Trump making another person famous. She sounds like a black racist.
White Trash Cunt House.
Fuck you, youtube!

Espn is disgusting
Some of you are acting sick. This is a human being you're calling names and demeaning. You can disagree with her, disagree with the people she represents, but at the end of the day, we're all human beings with unique thoughts and opinions. And how long is it gonna take before we understand that again?

If Bethesda wants to gain popularity from nintendo fans...\n\n\n\n\n....they're succeeding.
And Bethesda again shows itself to be better than E.A
This is massive.\n\nBethesda putting other 3rd parties on notice! Lol
Hell yeah, thank you id software and Nintendo.
Bethesda is one of the best allies helping   the Switch if other game developer give it more of a chance Switch will be way more successful. (Now here come the hate comments).
Never expected this
Holy shit Nintendo is back, now if they could bring The Witcher 3 for Nintendo Switch, then there will be a excuse for me to buy a Nintendo Switch. Something tells me SONY is watching and saying holy shit is time to bring PS4 Portable.
Holy shit, this is big, this is fucking Huge!!!
Fuck playing Doom and Wolfenstein on the go will be so sick
first time i saw this in direct\n\n\nme:WAIT WHAT
Vulkan API Boyz!!!!
Can we collect amiibos instead of the pop vinyls in doom for the switch?
haill to bethesda now wee need fallout 4
Amazing move from Nintendo!!!!
Did they hire that guy from Polygon to play this build too?
Fucking Doom wasn't expecting that, will buy
I guess Doom CAN run on anything...huh..
This is really a surprise, i don't know how a system wich can't run Overcooked at 30fps will be able to run DOOM on the go... Maybe it's a custom built, or those Switch are gonna melt for sure
The haters are going rage hater mode with this
Now we're talking!
My PC can max out these games but I want the portability, so I'll be buying them for Switch.
Now if only we could get Deus Ex Human Revolution on this thing. Don't feel like getting a Wii U to play that version of the game.\nEDIT: NVM, I take it back, I just remembered the Switch doesn't have Dual Screen functionality.
Switch underpowered umm nope...
Now, we want Metal Gear Solid V for Switch!! Come on, you can do it Big N!!
low settings 720p 60fps im fine with it just 60fps pleaseeeeee
damn the resolution looks sub 720p...
For the people who say that Doom on switch is 30 fps, it looks 600 fps (I know it's 60 fps)
Haters' reaction:\nbut.... but.... Switch has no power... no way... they're gonna be crappy ports... yeah... that's it... crappy ports....
XBOX IN 3RD PLACE NOW FOR SURE! SERVES THEM RIGHT THO HAHAHA
Nice announcement ! one thing i noticed is that the downgrade is huge, if they keep the 60 fps stable it will still be a blast to play regardless of the visual quality.
Can't wait to be sitting on my uber and killing demons and nazi's violently.
I hope people support this, I have DOOM for the PC and it was an incredible experience.  And now that Wolfenstein 2 is coming to the Switch, I might pick it up for that instead of the PC.  Nice one Nintendo!
is Carmack still with ID I want this game I'm so happy now.
Nintendo I vow that if any dark souls game is ported over to nintendo switch I will buy it tomorrow.
#DoomSlayer4Smash
I got a PlayStation ad.. lol.
and fifa switch is a fifa 18 ps3 port...
Kinda bummed that the Switch version of Doom won't be getting Snapmap. I'm probably one of those weirdos who really loved the idea of map building on the go.
If we get the next elder scrolls for switch, I would fucking bend the knee to Bethesda
Yay I can play the games I can never play cause I didn't have the right console
If switch gets doom\n\nOverwatch is a must now.
C A N Y O U F E E L T H E 3 0 F P S , M R  K R A B S
I can play Doom sitting on the toilet, in my bed, on the bus, in the sewers, on a tree, chilling in a hot bath,
Time for me to cancel my Wolfenstein PS4 pre-order...
Playing proper Doom while on a bus... that sounds fucking good.
I am not at all trying to sound greedy because this is freaking insane, CAN WE PLEASE GET DISHONORED 2 ON SWITCH?!?!?!
Swastika in a Nintendo Direct? *TRIGGERED*\n\nAll seriousness,  I'm glad Nintendo grew up.
I'm cool with some DooM on the go.
I'm glad i didn't buy doom last year. now ill be able to play the best version of the game and I'm really excited to buy and play this.
If you don't have a true understanding of the switches power. Just save your ignorant comments. The switch is slot stronger than alot of you realize.
I never thought Id hear this guy say Nazi
it's gonna be a weird feeling when the kkk and nazi's are on my switch.
Gey fucking in there... never got the chance to play doom
Watch cod 2018 be on switch.  I'm calling it
Did honestly never see this comming.\nI think i just came a little bit...
OMG YES! DOOM ON THE SWITCH!
I could get the graphically superior versions on PS4 but I'm getting both of these on Switch.  Portability > Graphics
0:23 DID NINTENDO JUST SAYED NAZI!?\n\nmah nigga nintendo is growing WILD
Well look at that. Nintendo says the word Nazi and shows the Swastika and the world didn't end. Man fuck these developers and their infantile pandering to the dumbest people on Earth.
Delet this
YYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS
yoooo
🎶bandz make Nintendo dance baybeeee🎶
Nazis?  In my Nintendo?
wow, megaton announcement :o speaking of which....  fallout 3 plx?
Iconic:v
Damn
Holy shit man!!!
WHOO!!! 🤘😆
Fuckin hell yeah
NAAAAAAAANIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
Thats incredible
OMG WTF DUDE THIS SHIT IS DOPE !
me Sorprende que lo pueda correr en la Nintendo switch
Yay, Doom on low settings and 30 FPS.
Lets just wait and see if the game actually runs on anything higher than 480p 25fps before we collectively suck Nintendos dick!!!
Doom's online mode is dead : /
will those two games be running on 20 fps?
Can doom even run 60 fps on the switch?
AND THEY'VE LISTENED! DECENT THIRD PARTY SUPPORT! THANK FUCK! Took their time since the SNES era though!
looks blurry af tho :/ hope it will be 60fps at least
I hope that the scenes they showed are switch footage (but it's probably not)
It the switch can run it, I'd like to see it for Android/iOS soon too
I wonder if doom will run at 60fps. Because the game was designed to run at a solid 60fps and anything less just won't work in my opinion
bad quality for nintendo switch\npd: better in pas4 and xbox one\npd: much better in PC Master Race
Looks like it's time to buy a lot more memory cards since the Switch has the same hard drive space as a Gameboy
Bruh, First Skyrim , then Doom and Wolfenstein, now I belive anything is possible. What's next? Fallout 4?!
teh switch has no hardcor gamsssss\nit babby consollllll\nit needs more schuuuut\n*wish gets granted, haters have nothing to complain about*\n....... the gaphics still sux\n*points out it runs on a handheld system*\n*hater cries*\nWaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Older nvidia shield tablet which is less powerfull(half the ram etc) can run crysis 3 on android so surely switch can run about anything on a fixed platform. Super exited gonna buy both! Allready played doom on powerfull pc but gameplay over the graphics and take it on the go muchnwow!1
Instead of porting old good games, nintendo is going to burn it self with new games that would barely run on it.\nIf Switch could run CS:GO and BF BC 2 on it with a decent multiplayer, their sells would be sky rocketing.
Is it just me or this smells like fucking downgrade?
Nice, but it won't sell well. Nintendo needs 3rd party games released on their system either exclusively or at the very least on the same day as the other platforms.
How about Prey the Goty
Yeah, because the Switch can totally run these.\nGuys I was joking, please stop replying !
xbox crossplay, please
Noice
Can you run doom on a machine equal to a xbox 360/ps3??????(the switch)....can it even properly run it with frame rate problems???? And a 32 gb harddrive????? No, you can't....iphones even have 64/128 gb....32 is it????? Thats it????
30fps lol
So we can expect to run like shit in that shitty console, so why are the nintytards excited?

I live in Florida and I had to evacuate, over 6 million people evacuated the roads were insane. I slept two days in my car on an area rest because there was no hotels available, and took shelter in a church. Im trying to vlog all of this but I don't have how to upload it now. Im currently on my way back to Florida, I don't know what to expect. I tried to contact neighbors to see what's going on in my region but had no luck reaching them. Im scared of going back to a completely destroyed home. Not to mention that power is still off for millions of people. If you have a chance please pray for Texas and everyone that was affected by Irma. This is truly a very scary and sad situation.
Diddy ugly ass worth over 500 million and he's out here asking all you broke people to donate what little you have!😂😂😂
u guyz suck.
They couldve gave themselves as well this is crazy
The Globe is warming soooooo fast, that our Antarctic ice caps are refreezing at the most rapid pace in recent history! I never knew how such hot temperatures could freeze water so fast!
I like that they used unlikely duos.
Hey MTV, why not show the full clip of Stevie Wonder in the beginning?  Not only his out of place, badly timed ad hominum toward those who might donate, but his insensitive Xian prayer that he sneaked into his speech.

The sad thing is that it takes something like this for us to help each other. That's the problem.
Fakest people on planet earth under one roof.
What if you physically don't have another hand to give.
Well put together, Aloha from Honolulu Hawaii
they even got the despacito guy!

they all can do it themselves. they are all rich right there. why are they asking money from us.  if your going to donate, go yourself over or do it  thru  someone u trust#jesus loves#jesus saves
beyonce said everything i am thinking ❤️💙👏🏼all my love and prayers are with those hurting
Was this logo designed by a communist?
We need you to donate all your money while we get more money from this event than you have in your entire life!\n\nShut up and take my money.

Weird, I remember Beyonce's Formation video showing an officer drowning in hurricane Katrina clean up.  She is scum
This is only #21 on trending? It oughtta be #1!!!
I live in Florida born and raised and haven't seen any relief money will we the ppl really be helped??
Does anyone realise that that room is worth billions? Raising 14 million dollars sound like a joke to me(considering having them all there). And Apple donated 5 mil of it. I know they have a good purpose. I can appreciate that. But that could be much more if these filthy rich people weren't this stingy. I feel bad for the world but today I especially feel bad for those victims. God bless them and protect them.
We're the actors really talking to people or is that more used as a visual representation of people giving to make other people give?
I am sorry but I do not have a red or grey hand so I feel your logo is just not reaching me.
We can do it together and I hope that all this money does good to all the people who need it
Japanese television programs should respect the overseas television, :(
These celebrities don't disappoint, do they? They really know how to make it about them. I've already donated to legitimate relief funds that didn't wait for a televised spot on all 4 major networks.
Four feet of water in my home in Meyerland. These bastards can go to hell! We as Houstonians did just fine without their look at me act like an ass benefit.
A disturbing number of people (kids?) commenting here seem to have a massive hard on for these elitist celebrities and have no problem elevating them to near god-like status. I guess should expect as much from your run-of-the-mill MTV audience. I hope that one day many of you will wake up and come to the realization that the elites don't give a shit about you.
GLOBAL WARNING IS A FRAUD....!!!!!!!    BUT YOU ARE SO NAIVE YOU    BE LIE VE      THEIR LIES....!!!
CAME HERE FOR TORI\nI LOVE U TORI\n\nBTW ISN'T IT IRONIC THE RICHEST CELEBRITIES ARE BEGGING FOR PEOPLE TO DONATE? DON'T THINK THEY DONATED A FRACTION OF WHAT THEY HAVE
this event is filled with so many secret transgenders, it's a hoot
Cam den, here is the answer: These Entertainment People have been playing a big role in bringing these disasters upon us, like hurricanes, tornados, floods, fires, and so on. These people have been paralyzing us by drugs, alcohol, on their TV, and movies with all kinds of sex and music to the point that our people are not able to think anymore, and they do not know who created them from ejected semen, just read those posts. These are the people who made us a Godless nation. Another reason for these disasters are those illiterate preachers who have been raping our hearts and souls with fake information for just a few $. You Have All The Rights to Deny, and Reject All of These Existing Fake and False Religions! But, now we have the Scientifically Proven Scripture based on Mathematics the Exact Science, which tells you the truth about our Creator, but again this same media have been trying so hard to hide it from our people ever since 40 years ago. It says if you DO NOT thank your Creator every day for the roof over your head, for your jobs in order to get His provisions, for your health, protections, and happiness, and if you do not pay 10% of your earnings to the needy relatives, fatherless children, and homeless people, then DO NOT expect any protection from your Creator, although He has given us enough respites. This is the only message could save you, otherwise you are only going to suffer before our Land Lord Creator evict you from His temporary dwelling.
why cant all these celebs donate among themselves instead of asking us for dough. Its a joke.... when will the sheeple wake the f___ up....
This would be a beautiful thing if the money actually went to the people who need it. Yes the real America helped each other and showed their compassion, but all of you celebrities are doing nothing more than what you get paid to do, and that is act.
JJ watt collected 31 million real dollars compared to your 14 million fake pledge dollars and he was at ground zero passing out food and water Hollywood calling the working man a racist and a nazi than begs him for money so hmmmm give u greedy fucktards money or jj watt i went with jj i encourage the rest of hard working Americans to do the same
More left-wing propagandists making money off of a disaster.  I have to wonder what percentage will ever make it to the people who need it.  Good Lord, these hateful, left-wing hypocrites make me want to puke.  So full of themselves.
These damn celebrities good give a rat's ass about the common people! They live in their own fantasy world with selfies! Bunch of hypocritical morons that are out of touch with the common people!!
Money  raised by a bunch of liberals, only a fraction of the money will go for helping those in need, the rest will go in their pockets, Please give to another organization, these folks already have to much money,
Dont there just going to take them money and run like the rich always do I am taking them a truck load of fresh water next week help how you can
The comment section is frustrating...
I bet they had a really good time and they partied just inflating their egos these celebrity dirtbags
Nice, but you celebs are idiots! If you each give 1m, so much will be done! I'm never buying a ticket to a concert seeing that these celebs can't truly give back after earning so much from us. Just ridiculous!
Ah MTV. When we aren't busy ruining the very fabric of your family by corrupting your kids with immoral values and depravity, we like to all hold hands and take one day out of the year to give back ;)
Collectively these entertainers have a net worth in the multiple billions and maybe as high as $15 billion.  Oprah alone is worth $3 billion.  Many of them are worth multiple 100's of millions.   How much of their extra money did they give?  Too many of them had to make their political agendas heard where there was no need in this sort of event.  This is one of the major reasons they could only raise $44 million while having exposure on multiple networks.   To put this in perspective the Jerry Lewis Telethon in 1990 raised $44 million (1990 dollars) and had much less exposure.   Most people were turned off and would rather donate through other avenues.
Cam den & ReligionwhistleBlower, Here is how media and entertainment society brainwashed us. They have been showing us that it is ok to go all around the world to those poor countries and kill millions of their innocent people and take away their natural resources. They have been showing us that it is ok to kill 10 million Native Americans together with their buffalos. They have been showing us that black lives don’t matter. They showed us that it is ok to throw atomic bomb and kill innocent people. They took away the name of our Creator from the face of our nation and they let those illiterate preachers who worship idols mislead us, that is why the Angeles of the Almighty, the drives of the wind bring down 1900 tornados upon them every year plus floods, fires, and hurricanes, and mudslides. Our media have been showing us that fast foods are good for us, yet every year people are dying of cancers and many other diseases instead of a normal death. They have been showing us that chemical fertilizers are good, and they say spray your food with chemical poisons it is good for you. Our media have been showing us that polluting the air is ok and we don’t get lung cancer because of that. They have been promoting cigarettes; alcohol and gambling in order for us to die of lung cancers, accidents, family problems, and divorces. They have been promoting all kinds of sex, adulteries and homosexuality in order for us to get different diseases and aid killing 49 million so far. They have been showing us that killing our own people it is ok, that is how they have been promoting guns for all. They have been showing us that white color crimes are ok, that is why they do not charge those highly educated criminals. Everything our media have taught us is against the laws of our creator. You are right they have been hiding the awesome message of our creator based on mathematics ever since 40 some years ago. The crimes that media have committed are far greater than all of those criminals from the beginning of time combined. Leaving the system of our creator only brings down suffering and disasters upon us. Therefore, when the Almighty sends His next disaster just make sure that is the consequence of our own wrong doings, so do not complain. His law is, “Nothing happens to you if you follow the rules of our Creator”.
don't donate to them because most of the money goes to making this video ads etc.
Those celebrities were all paid to answer the phones on tv.... from donations. And many were seen joking around. The rich don't care. Ever seen a celebrity actually volunteer .... by doing manual labor for more than a few minutes??

Damn 😕Stevie wonder never age he looks younger and younger every time I see him he  been in the music business before  Micheal Jackson 👑 was dominating the music business in the 80s and  and he still look younger than most 30 or or 40 year olds
you want us to donate money to rich people living in exotic locations who are too stupid to get insurance? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA !  HELL NO !!!
the jets changing our #climatechange for decades. Share and care, peace and love for all.
very sad ,and it could happen anywhere and will ,but we americans WILL ALWYS SURVIVE AND MOVE ON ,,,,,GOD BLESS US
Global Warming, Climate Change, or what ever you are calling that scam, is a hoax!  Stop taking the Red Pill.
I like how they talked about Aric playing piano but the video of him playing was muted
MTV sicker!  Sucker  ! Take advantage with fake  hurricanes!  Mademan . Gonna see in few month what ya really do with all money donation..... stop people get fooled and waste your money  in this fake cause go by yourself and give direct to Texas, Houston, Miami not by this stupid HAND IN HAND ORGANISATION! MK ULTRA CELEBRITY PROMOTE LOOK AT THEIR EYES IS DEMON AND HYPNOSE...feeling bad and uncomfortable 4 the real victim
Reading most of the comments for hand n hand some very disturbing.\nAnyway we all subjected to our own opinion. We can't stop natural disaster but can help after it hpn.\nTimes like these is very heartbreaking to see but if we not living as God want us to probably a disaster needed to hpn in order for us to come together as a family n help each other. \nHand n Hand if u all can maintain wat u doing, u all can n will make a great difference in people life.\nShe say Even d scrums from d master table will make her hole , a rich man waste is a poor man's  wealth .wat since it make to pride our self in riches , hand n hand if u all can record every step of d way contributions ah being made. \nHand n Hand shud become the major world aid funding organizations.
By the way... do you say WHERE to get the AID for those people that need it?.. I don't see that anywhere. Remember when Hillary got all that money for Haiti? She and Bill KEPT all that money and oh gave some to their rich friends. To this day, people in Haiti have NOT seen any of that money!
WORSE CONCERT, EVER,  for relief efforts. It was completely audaciously arrogantly pathetically...political. Damn liberals. Why is it that every so-called, self-entitled Artist, is usually a hypocrite democrat liberal? Why? \nI was going to donate my hard-earned hundred dollars to the benefit. But since it was political in every respect, I kept the money. Besides. Those homes/businesses/property damaged, will be more than graciously funded by the federal and state governments. \nNot only that. But being that the entire concert was pathetically relating everything in the world to theoretical global warming. And calling Americans...Idiots, I highly doubt any amount of money donated would go to hurricane relief.  \nShameful. Pathetic. A mildly active year in the Atlantic, and liberal hypocrites proclaim it is the end-of-the-world, with Greenhouse effect, happening globally. \nNext time. Just play some music. Keep politics out-of-it, and you'll get plenty of donations. But artists calling people/viewers, Idiots, is totally uncalled for and extremely biased. And artists proclaim they are not racist. You are fine being next to a liberal so long as you do not disagree with them.
The absolute height of Liberal insanity; blaming the whether on Trump and Terrorism.\nABSOLUTE FUCKTARDS.
are this a South Park episode?
How do the victims get this money? There's nothing in the hand in hand or online anywhere on how the hurricane victims can get this donated money. Where's the victim apply spot?
*Y'all know you ain't answering no damn phones!*
This benefit raised $44 million, the wealthy involved who are worth hundreds of millions each, could have created a foundation, donate hundreds of millions and make sure the money actually gets to the people.
Jordan Story at 7:45 Has me in tears and Then I heard a Beautify Voice Usher Just Beautiful
Celebrities who are sending a message to send money but, have no inkling to associate with a program which provides significant information on a rebuild or a promise of responsibility post the Hand in Hand airing, is why you are donating.  At least give people a way to verify organizations/associations/foundations involved in the disaster response.  Red Cross everybody knows about but this thing is the equivalent of a bank being created over night and there are many channels for distributing the resources.

Oh wow so much hate in the comments. No wonder America is going to the dogs. I do pray for the victims of Irma and Harvey and I appreciate the work the heroes, celebs and communities are doing to help them. For all those haters out there who think its silly for rich celebs to ask others for money, clearly you don't get how it works. Billions of dollars in damages is what people are facing. You seriously expect the celebs to all empty their accounts. No. They will give what they can: probably a million or two but even more because of who they are they can raise so much more. How many ppl would want to have a chat with George Clooney or Justin Bieber or OPRAH (not Orcca or Opera. Ridiculous). The answer is thousands if not millions. If these thousands each donate $10 that's at least $10,000 that can go a long way. Celebs are very influential, whether you like it or not. One message from Queen Bey or Nicole Kidman or JT and you're diving for the phone. I'm all the way in Africa making peanuts and I wanted to donate. Still wish I could. So get over the hate, hold someone's hand and help how you can. If you can't do that well God help you.
it is so nice to see how everyone joins to help their country no matter who they are.                  the president was not invited xD
I wish all of you who are complaining have already donated. Y'all just complain. At least these celebrities are doing something.

Please email me if you interested in helping harvey and Irma victims we can help but we need the funding to make. A project on this grand of a scale a reality so if you can extend a helping hand our purpose is to serve the public and to those in need the world is so dark we need to help each other out \n\nWe specialize in blackout and brownout and situations we are here to help but we need your help to mass produce this product to help those who need it!!!\n\nContact info for funding or lending to Coolerator Products Inc. \n\nAsk For The Director And President \n313-458-3092

MTV is globalist trash
Why is everyone so mad?
It was a nice gesture all these celebrities seemingly showing REAL concern for victims of ALL these tragedies but let's GET REAL FOR MINUTE. By the show's end Billy Crystal said that had raised 14 million 500 thousand something. First, there were more than 14 celebrities participating in the show and let's just say each of them donated a million of their millions or billions ( P. Diddy ALONE COULD OF DONATED 20 MILLION WITHOUT FLINCHING, SAME FOR JULIA ROBERTS,GEORGE CLOONEY,ADAM SANDLER) then HELLO they would have had WAY MORE than 14 million in an hour!!!And 2,  I am a disabled single parent who is in school FULL TIME with poverty level income and still have already amassed 2 truckfuls of donations of ALL KINDS. Money,food,blankets,clothes (for every member of a family), toys, toiletries etc.and sent it to further south (I'M IN FLORIDA)because I don't even have a decent vehicle to take it myself! IT'S RIDICULOUS! THE RICHEST 1% asking the other 99% for help! WE ALREADY ARE!! REALLY?!!! GET OFF THE PHONE AND GO TO THE DESTRUCTION AND OFFER YOUR HELP FOR REAL!! #HUMANITY #MUST #STAND #TOGETHER #TO #OVERCOME
Darius Rucker is my man crush

Very excited for Odyssey! And definitely prefer this subtitled version to the American voice-over version of the video; it's nice to have Koizumi-san telling me about his game (nice suit, by the way)

Sometimes goodbye are the only way\n#R.I.P we love u\n💓😭😭
Why u did that Chester :(
Wow, beautiful. I've been a fan since the very beginning and I saw you guys perform for the first time over 10 years ago and it's still one of the craziest, best experiences of my life. Thank you Chester and Linkin Park for all the amazing memories and great music you guys have put together over the years.
What a beautiful soul. Caring. Still sad enough with the fact that your demons took the best of you, but happy enough knowing how much your music helped creating part of person who I am today. Thank you!
Dose who dislike this, dey dont care if one more light goes out😓😓😓
The video adds weight to the song even more.😥
RIP Chester. You were one of my hero's your music kept me fighting and I will always keep fighting. I love you.
I can;t stop crying.
It's truly painful to say goodbye to your hero. RIP my hero
you must go further, do it for Chester, Linkin Park should live on
LOVE FROM INDIA ❤....REST WELL CHESTER...
He was playing blue whale
i've always dreamed to go to one of your concerts, chester. I was so in love with your songs, your personality. I was a child and i didn't understand the lyrics of your music...it's so sad. The people who suffer more are always the funniest and deepest . I'd like to help you when you was still alive (sorry for my bad english)
how u got all that money and opportunity to afford any help and still kill yorself...idk u gotta be pretty mental..i just dont get it
I cant be the only grown man shedding a tear right now
Does anyone know why he killed himself
May the next world be kinder than the one you felt forced to leave behind. May we never forget the impact you had on us all.
Smile because it happened. Thank you Chester, there will always be a light on. R.I.P
That scream at 3:18, gives me goosebumps every time.\nRIP Chester 😭
PPL who touched the dislike button, just die in hell😈☠️💀
This hit me hard af... reminds me to not end it and keep going. Everyone struggles with something, just wish someone could of changed his mind. Rip Chester you will forever be remembered my dude.
Might get lost in the comments.\n\nStill miss you Chester, I graduated high school this year. Your music helped me through my school years. When I heard In The End on a cheap mp3 my dad gave to me in 4th grade. I instantly fell in love with your music. You were my idol and you made me and millions of your fans feel special and unique. I promise myself to learn to play the guitar so I can play your songs when I'm down. Thank you Chester, Mike, and the rest of Linkin Park.
Speechless. This is just so beautiful
Can't watch it without crying 😔😢
Thats the thing. Chester's light isnt out. He's just on vacation for a long while
lost a legend\n\n\nagain
Love you Chester ♥\nRest in Peace
2month without you brother.. still broken! 💔😭😭 #RIP_CHESTER 💐
Well, I do.\nWe all do.\n\nRest In Peace, Legend. \nLong live Linkin Park.
Very ironic that this song they wrote for those who lost someone and need some emotial song and in the end they wrote this song for themselves :( RIP CHESTER
A true man never dies...
My heart is literally breaking.
Who's the vocalist
Who cares if one more light goes out? Well we do, bro. We care too. Especially now, about yours.\n\nI just learned of your passing this evening, and it comes with great shock & sadness.. I just heard your voice on the radio only hours earlier in the day (on 94.5 The Buzz in Houston). Two months have passed since your tragic fate. But I personally hadn't known. Funny thing, time, and how all things are relative -- it's as though you were still alive. And indeed you still are, in our hearts. You were a raw singing talent and a great human-being in deep touch with humanity (through your charity) and with the human condition (through your personal struggles, strife & pains as well as your recoveries, reconciliations & triumphs). You bared your soul to us all -- as only great, talented, true artists do, and real, genuine, in-tune humans can -- and so we do care. A lot. About you, and your passing. RIP, bro. Your voice and singing words have always connected with and moved many of us all, and will always do so by living on & continuing to touch many more of us in the future. And for that, you deserve only thanks. Thanks for being who you were in this world, for your genuine human art, and for who you are as a solicitous spirit living on....
He cried his soul out. :(
What i dont understand is that they made this before he died and no one suspected he wanted to kill himself
All of us that watched, shared and liked this video care that our One light was put out. Chester you were the one light of hope to all of us. RIP Legend we all will see you again one day.😭😭😭
I couldn't stop crying. Love you Chester, we miss you <3
Some once said  A person doesn't die by Gun, Poison, Disease... a person dies when he is forgotten Chester will always be in our heart he shall never be forgotten.
One more question... WHY?.. But we all know it... And still Why??.... So unreal................
This is such a beautiful tribute to Chester. His memory and voice will always be with us. Chester wherever you are I hope you are not hurting.
Chester is a legend and legends never die #peacefromArabworld
RIP Chester\nYou'll always live in our hearts. 😞
I love Chester 😭😭😭😭😭\nI from Vietnamese
I grew up listening to Linkin Park and never saw them live and now I can never see them live
He is in a better place now :') \n\n\n\n\nlet's all hope that :')
Try not to cry, try not to cry, try not to cry, try not to cry, try not cry, try not to cry...*cries* shit...\nI love you Chester, I love you Linkin Park!🖤🖤🖤💜💜💜 You guys were the very first Rock Band I started listening too (at the age of 12) and I still love you guys to this very day🖤🖤🖤💜💜💜 \nStay strong🖤🖤🖤💜💜💜
I doubt anyone's going to see this, but...\nLinkin Park was a band that helped me through a lot. Their music stopped me from harming myself. Chester's voice was what helped me through middle school, through my bad times and through heartbreaks. I don't think any other band has done that. I have them to thank for that...but especially Chester.\nRock in paradise. 🖤
rest in pride chester!!

Breathtaking in so many ways💘
Demitria is such a pretty name wish she went by it more
she has the cutest laugh ever  love her so much
That low key riverdale ad tho 😂love that show!
is that a photo of taylor and selena on the box?
When you realize you and Jimmy are actually bffs
I love her smile, its the best
Yesss I LIVE FOR DEMI. she's my idol 😊 You go girl! 😂
I thought he was gonna ask what her favourite dish is
Water murder affect inside list arrange pleasure affair
She's fine af
*BFFs my ass, they didn't get one right* *LOL*
Where the heck does Jemetria come from? XD
This was the cutest thing!
I honestly chose almost all of the same answers as Demi!!!
All my friends call me Jemmi❤ but you can call me Jemetria😐😐😬😬
Demi is so gorgeous! Love her style!! But jimmy is also awesome as always 😎
Sorry can't be Jemmi. That belonged to the original Jemi.
I said I watch the walking dead and i guessed jimetria.. their names rhyme so it would of been jemi or dimmy, so I thought of jimetria. I love Demi lovato
Visit www.indis.me and expose the world's worst liars!
Way too much clothes on 👎
Yeah and I'm 38 in doggy years
I can't even get any reception in New York City I spat all over my screen!
Okay well I would be Jimmy Fallon's best friend cause I got all his answers right 😂
Thought I'd play along and I jus happened to get jimmys princess question right #besties
Tney are so cute i can't handle it 😫💘
I love how he's low key promoting Riverdale
*Ahkgh-Ahkgh-Ahkgh-Ahkgh-Ahkgh* that's how she sounds when she laughs
Who wouldn't answer iPhone?? I mean c'mon Jimmy
Demi's laugh is just EVERYTHING the world needs
Demi knew damn well that he would put Jemmi
Why wouldn't they both put Friends for the tv show they would binge? Get it...friends...best friends 😅
Fallon and his handlers craft top-notch fashionable, modern urban-hip 'entertainment' that premier cities like LA & NYC eat up with the desperate hunger a smack addict has for his fix.  And the rest of the USA is supposed to find this funny?  What the rest of the USA found funny was Leftards in their post-election meltdown last November.  Now THAT was awesome viewing!
The correct answer of course was: Dimmi Fallato
If you're on a deserted island.... THERE IS NO CELL SERVICE. So to bring an iPhone is pointless.
I'm Jimmy Fallon on the whole Riverdale/The Walking Dead thing 😂
To bad she's married
LMFAO  I should've said my dogs
Demi is so pretty now!
I should've said my dogs lmaoo she's so cute
Who the hell is Demi Lovato?
But Jemi is Joe and Demi 😢
Omg Demi yessss the walking dead is life it's everything 😊😊😊
Can you guys help me reach 20 subs? I just made a rock/metal dedicated channel and your help would be very much appreciated :)
Always pick a satellite phone if you are stranded somewhere!!!!
I don't know her, sorryp
It's only me or Demi always do the same things as Ariana :(
Riverdale is the best!
Not gonna lie I fan girled when Jimmy said Riverdale
Who took a screenshot when she said walking dead was her favorite show 😬😬😬
Her handwriting is lovely. I love her. 😍
I love how much Jimmy loves Riverdale almost as much as I love it 😉😂
Im glad she is so pretty and talented cause she is not the smartest cookie in the jar LOL

I miss Zayn's high notes.. I fucking miss Zayn.. the high note at 3:23 it reminds me Zayn and One Direction.. At the best song ever and other music's.. I just miss the.. Pls.  Comeback..😭😭
Hoping this was Zayn and Liam😕😢
these days lambo has been turned into jaguar .... !
Zedd nd Liam both did a good song....hoping more collab from them.... \nThis video made me think of one thing.... Love u Zedd and Liam❤❤
OH MY GOD .. what i have just was just unbeleivable... love u liam. you took me to another world
Ali-A, Liam Payne - Get Low (street video)*
Liam's wearing a bomber with FEAR OF GOD written on it just like Zayn's sweatshirt in Still Got Time !
how many of you paused  the video to check that girl in nude ass 😉
I see that cheeky little sugglife phone case at 1:55 😏
Am I the only one who clicked on this thinking they covered, TO THE WINDOOOOOOOW TO THE WALL!!! TIL THE SWEAT DROPS DOWN MY BALLS!!!???
It seems like Liam is enjoying a good life right now. I can see it through his music and lyrics. Just have fun Bro. You're only young once. And for Zedd, always a masterpiece. Good Job! Well done!
This Kid is a Dad. #Liam
I've seen better dancing from a turtle.
1:57 reminds me when he was dancing like this in the disguise of an old man... 😭😭 1D plzzz come back😭😭
Liam looks so tired 😴 is it the baby lol
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH OH MY GOD
His jacket says Fear of God and is black with white stripes\nIn Still Got Time, Zayn's shirt says the same and is the same\n❤❤\nOne Direction
the reason why 1D separated because they want to sing SEX-SONG. Thanks Harry Styles for keep on making good music than the rest do. but I still want 1D to reunite. I've been a DIRECTIONER since 2012.
zedd looks so much better with the scruff here haha
This is what a song should be, giving happiness to everyone 😊
AAAAAA I LOVE THE ATMOSPHERE
THIS VIDEO MAKES ME SO HAPPY!!! I thing the official video won't be as fun as this one. Love it!!!!!!!!
This song makes me want to take a girl on a date pull up to Popeyes and park. Just to see her reaction.
Liam u make any1 die by ur presence.The crowd was actually vibrantly dead.
Love love the song and love the video even more!!! 😭❤❤
Worst shit of all time. Well Taylor Swift is 1st then this crap!
I really love the beat of Get Low plus the mix of voice of my baby, Liam. Hehe!!!
This is Such a cool and cute video i really dig it
Zedd dancing with the crowd is everything.
They look like brothers
I thought this was Nick Jonas
i see ONE THING in 2017 version:')
Ok i'm moving to London.

United in diversity...  I see that... How music made United..  I see the Muslim with her hijab,  black,  white...

Awesome song and nice video
Love that musica
my two favourite kids.
GET LOW, GET LOW.
Please let's stop listening to his music and not fund this child molester. We have to protect eachother, our children and young women from these predators who think they can get away with everything because they have some money! Cut his paycheck! We need to unite and take care of eachother.
I wished the hosts asked a little more questions . Poor Tamera looked so disturbed and concerned ..
These girls need to stop acting so grown and thinking they can handle adult situations. Listen to yo momma, sit yo ass down and complete school. Find other TEENAGE interests like dance, soccer, youtubing, makeup, etc. instead of trying to be about that life. This is what you have to do to get those nice things.
She's a THOT! If I was 16 and I saw an older woman and man naked I would run, even if it was my celebrity crush ✌️
So nobody notices everytime they need a distraction in the media a new story comes out about rkelly right when everybody is trying to find out what happened to Kenneka Jenkins
That bitch lying she was fucking before she met kellz
These comments calling her dumb and naive for not saying no or leaving are insensitive and non compassionate. It's similar to calling women in abusive relationships dumb for not leaving or a person foolish for being with the abusive man (or woman) in the first place. We really don't know what was going on in her mind at the time, even if what was going on in her mind was a thirst for attention/love and thoughts rooted in insecurity. We just don't know.  However it's still wrong for him to be sexually involved with underage women. Period.
Who is Just waiting For Adrienne to announce that she is pregnant this Episode😍 #hopeitishappeningthisseason
Where were your parents at 16, why werent you at home or school? she liked it or liked what she was getting out of it be it money or a lavish lifestyle. At 16 you know what it means when a man says take of your clothes and hes naked and so is a strange lady, she didnt refuse she consented to it. I hate these stories.
Is this the girl he peed on?
How your parents let you be gone to do all this at 16 and you just with the shots wtf are y'all talking to these kids about?
If Tamar was still on the show she would of went off script and been like Girl were was your Mama!
No one forced you to suck his ass you dumb hoe, it was your choice.
The Real, what is the purpose of uploading the same teaser videos you have a social media? I'm unsubscribing. These 1 min or less videos are a waste of time. Bye👋🏽
Don't believe her.
Hold on ???? Aint that the girl from sister sister ?
🎶You a pussy, you get popped. You a groupie, you a op.🎶  If I'm to believe this story (that gets more sensational everytime she tells it) she was INVITED  and She CHOSE to stay and participate. Victim? Slave?  Bish where? You thought you were going to be the new Mrs. Kelly but in reality you were just a plaything and he grew tired of you. You feel used, stupid,  and regret all the stuff you did,  but it was your choice to do them.
This is what he meant by Bump n Grind
I don't believe the mainstream he has a sex cult come on every black celebrity the mainstream media always turns everybody against them at the day did Bill Cosby now they're going to R Kelly again just like they did Michael
Oh please give me a break with this R Kelly mess!!! R KELLY WE need TP4 ASAP!!!!2017 @NOW please!!!
Next move can't erase your past moves
She was 16 and having sex with anyone willing!? Where is her father
Something don't add up. So you're 16 and you go onto a bus with two naked ppl and you're told to take your clothes off and you just do it? Hmmm ok... seems like some one stopped getting paid.... N before anyone comes at me I don't support what this guys is doing but there is always somethings being left out.
Cable is dead. No more tv programming for me. The clips are annoying. I won't watch it another way but online. Oh well. It's a great show but oh well
On the show they also said that she took a lie detector test and she was truthful
I'm gonna need y'all to get it together this season and post clips that have a decent length. 21 secs and broken stories are annoying!
All this happened, but yet u decided to not report it..........
It's the remix to ignition
Trash thot shut up u wanted to do it bc he was famous
Why did your mom let you go to the tour bus? Why did you stay when you seen them take off their clothes? You removed your clothes and had sexual relations with that woman? 🤔
Off topic but Adrienne looking like a full course Thanksgiving dinner
this is fake news
Yet u people still call Michael Jackson a pedophile...SMDH
Tam...that hair is a NO NO 😪
Sorry but at 16 you know what's up, one time back in the 90s when cashmoney was starting. They where staying at this hotel my sister worked at and they invited my cousin and i to the room. I was maybe like 13 but looked older, and I could smell the weed too.  but i was like hell no something can go down and I didn't want that. I was excited to see them but not to go. So I don't know what these girls expect. So many fans and you get chosen,  theirs a reason. And sorry but why are you at a grown man's trials or whatever , when he sings sex songs. Being a kid and hearing r Kelly,  I knew it was sexy songs, nothing bad now that I am grown. #wakeup
She's telling portions of the truth,  that's why she passed the lie detector test. She must be very ashamed of herself. That's embarrassing that she let herself be used like that. That part where the girl was teaching her things, that was a lie. She knew exactly why she was invited to his tour bus, chiiile, please. He still wrong though.
I hate when people say i was just a teen, that means you are old enough to know right from wrong. She knew R Kelly was a pedo, but he is rich & famous so she wanted to be with him now she wants to play the victim.
Truth is... R kelly is still not guilty and these allegations haven't been proven. She could be making this up...who knows.
didnt kells tell this bitch to keep it on the downlow?
im early where's You Tried It! with the funny comments?
Let's exposed that DNA trash!!! .... Tanks the REAL For  R E A L topics and issues!!!
Sorry i don't care how old is she unless if she is less than 13yo. She also should've know better. The responsibility relay on them 50/50.\nWhen i was 15 i started working to support my family. When i was 17, i immigranted to another continent by myself alone.\nThere is something all ppl have called common sense and knowing if what u r doing is wrong.\nThis bitch was looking for fame.\nGurl bye
Just read this guys history for people who are skeptical.\n\nhttps://vigilantcitizen.com/latestnews/r-kelly-dubbed-master-mind-control-allegations-claim-holding-women-will-cult/#xxri=0
Kelly my man go back to the studio and make some hits WTF IZZ U DOING BRO??
How is this guy not in jail?
and you hung around ...stayed ....keep doing what you were told ..and now >>>drum roll please >>>>I'm a victim  ....she's out for $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Where are your parents? They just let you go on his tour bus alone at sixteen?
R.Kelly: Girl I'm gone beat you when you get home to daddy.
Something is not right .. it's more to these stories .. these women were young .. where was the parents ??.. no schooling ??..... maybe the families were paid.. u never no
It's ok R Kelly is an oppressed black man in a white supremacist society. It's not his fault, it's the fault of the white man. You should all go and riot in the street to fight against the injustice against this poor dindu nuffin brotha.
subscribe in my channel and i will subscribe in your channel
It's so sad women get abused even more from the public for speaking out about a disgusting abusive manipulative man. She never said he raped her, she said she did everything willingly but obviously he was very manipulative. Everyone does not have parents, or if they do it's some trash ass parents who don't care about their children. Abusers chose their victims wisely and know who they can get to do whatever they want. \nAs a child you think like ok I love him, I really want him to like me too and I guess I have to have sex for him to like me. It is dumb but kids that aren't taught think like this, they worship celebrities like God. The process of manipulation is deep, he made her feel loved, her took care of her. She probably thought omg this is the best thing that has happened to me, then the abuser adds in more and more abuse.
LOL. the Real Girls are like wish it was me.. Jajajaja
At the West-2017 exercises, the Russian Ka-52 Alligator helicopter opened fire on viewers\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8fTKJoQvPM
Who would want to bang that ugly chick?
must be a slow week for youtube if this is on trend :/ or something else, I wonder what...
Man cut the bull! You wanted it, you liked it, and you went back for it and continued to engage in it! Lls. Just be real.
Yes this sad for him, but am I the only one thinking she looks ridiculous as well? At 16 I would've known to leave immediately!!
Fuckin black names are so funny lol
She knew what she wanted!
0:15 😂😂😂😂😂
http://payhip.com/b/dJwN
Tamera is so beautiful!
BITCH U A THOT STFU THIS SHOW LAME ASF GIVING HER CLOUT
illuminati confirmed
She should stop saying she's 16 as though that's the reason for her naivety. 16, in America a country with so much technology and information and education, speaking fluent English, access to internet maybe even free internet.......oh puh-lease she made her Choice
so what the hell is this it ????   what happened to full interview ????
okey.. 16 years old can understand that u don't have to take ur clothes off if u want to.. gold fucking digger your kind help those pedophiles to hunt for more
u went into the to bus and he was naked, shouldn't dat have alarmed u to get out of there
He going to hell
Do anybody really cares about some damn hoe being with R. Kelly.We have cops around The US killing unarmed black folks.Former Officer Jason Stockley got off last for killing an unarmed black from 2011.The Real need to do better stories than this.
So there is a trainer?? And presumably someone driving a tour bus who could be involved? Have these people ever been required to testify?
I just don't understand how R. Kelly is still walking the streets! This dude needs to be locked up
So he getting charged then
What happened why they are not uploading its already tuesday evening in Malaysia!
I was sitting here watching this on tv and I get a notification that this channel has uploaded this same conversation. All that speed and STILL no girl chat. Why Sway? You know damn well half of us are mostly here for girl chat. Stop playing.
I agree with the comments post the whole episode more people would be able to watch
I don't get it. Is R. Kelly's music hypnotizing these girls AND their parents like the Pied Piper or what? I mean come on. Are these girls under eighteen? Then how are they with this older man?//I think some the parents are pimping out their daughters for economic relief.//It's not far-fetched. There have been cultures who sold/gave their daughters to men with wealth to ease the family's financial burden. Sad but it happens.
The fact that they never post the full interviews like Wendy does is extremely annoying to me. Not everyone records the show, has time to actually watch the show while it is on, & not everyone lives in the USA😒 Really about to loose a fan over this bs
Who's idea was it to make her look like she's in middle school???
She lying

Never forget what Corey Feldman said about theses Hollywood pedos..they are the top stars with money!
The real is real for this fr!
like I said #AllWomenAreWhores
She said unfortunately R.Kelly was not the first person who had done something to her. She said she was sexually abused as a child.  So that's why it was easier for R. to get to her... pedophiles know who to prey upon. It's absolutely sick.
Look at the size of that fucking whale on the right lmao. Can't believe you sad, jobless Americans actually watch this shite.
I'm not sure why she acting like a victim. U proactively went to the tour bus. U stayed when u saw two grown ass people naked. Then u let the check freak you out. Then stuck around to get it on with Rkelly. She knew and we knew at 16 what was right or wrong. Stop the bullshit. But yes. Rkelly is a sick bastard. Lol
If R Kelly guilty of all these b💩 stories what are these lil lying ass girls parents guilty of...#thingsthatmakeugohmmm#
Avicii ft. Martin Garrix\nAvicii ft. Kygo\nAvicii ft. Ed Sheeran
Rita looks hot \nLike if you agree
paint in the vagina..that can't be good?
I love this song
I HAD TO SHARE THIS
Why does Avicci get credit if they didn't even sing?
Comparing this to Rita's 'Your song', she sounds like she has so much autotune that it doesn't sound like her at all...
This will be a huge hit , Rita <33
Wake Me Up is one of my favorite electronic songs, but this was a little in the disappointing side tbh
I love this song badly ..
I love both of AVICII and the singer ！！！
im crazy with this song. i like it very much..
I'm totally love ur music since I jhs
wow! love the jam, makes me see through the eyes of my lover and best friend, crazy ,but the only way we got to be together in this world filled with hate...
Cheers up . King is back
Avicii doesn't have comparison, he's from another world 🔥💯
I love this song
i forgot to subscribe\nim so stupid

Blind woman not blind anymore sees her husband for the first time then a really attractive looking guy few days later. Rip.

I'm actually scurred
My Last Duchess
WTF?! Watching!
That's fucked up
Seems very interesting
Omg Blake lively😍
What
tukin
Can’t wait !
Must see
more trailer https://goo.gl/NHB5rg
Serena Van Der Woodsen
Heckin heck this I'm playin Odyssey
ch chaa
She is sexy
damn!
Чудесное видео!
why didnt she divorce first
is anyone else confused
Uh oh upper East siders looks like S has gone full dark this time and by dark I mean shes back to her old tricks will she come back a good girl or is she finally gone for good?Let's wait and see \n\nXoxo Gossip Girl
Fucked up version of At First Sight
Every eye movie I've seen was stupid
Sorry Stranger Things 2 is on that day also
the movie will end with him blinding her again to try and get her to stay with him
Damn, Blake lively is everything! I’m gonna cry during this movie, I know it.
It can't be thriller without a sex scene huh!?
another marriage is horrible and men are all evil plot, so original
Looks like a great movie!
-----------------------\nHi everyone, anyone wanna hear the ture gospel?\nSearch: Renee Roland\nEveryone in the comments are nice kind people they can answer your question or etc. \n------------------------
It's said that the ideal arrangement is a blind woman with a deaf man. Playa had it half right. Done messed up.
Is Ryan ok with this ?
No need to watch this movie. Eyesight makes her a whore. The end.
It seems the only real hardship this loving couple faces is difficulty conceiving a child but when Gina is given the...\n\nI bet he was giving her Plan B, but told her they were prenatal vitamins or something.
A wise man once said... THESE HOES AIN'T LOYAL
Did the guys over at Explosm Entertainment make this trailer?
She's given a second chance at sight and the idiot chooses to ruin her body with cigarettes.  Classic.
TL;DW she gets her sight back and becomes a superficial whore. the end
Slowing down a pop song in the trailer  trend needs to die ...
The husband ends up re-blinding her in the end because his fear of losing her becomes too great.\n\n\nOops!   SPOILERS!
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, I'M SCARED.
Finally a trailer that doesn't give away the damn plot!!! It looks good
There is almost a  20 year age difference between the two actors...
They should've had Ryan Reynolds play the husband hands down. I'm not saying that you should have the real couple play the couple in movies, I'm just saying that they are already a perfect couple in real life and they both happen to be amazing actors, so Ryan should've without a doubt played the boyfriend/husband role.
Idk her acting is never that convincing to me especially in emotional scenes but looks interesting
She looks like that Blake girl......oh
Looks like after getting her sight back, Serena Van der Woodsen's starting to *see* his true colors. Xoxo, Gossip Girl.
It would be cool if her husband wasn't a psycho but instead he left her and she took her sight for granted but at the end of the movie after she has lost everything her husband comes back.
They should change the name of the movie to All I see is your pussy lol \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm joking
Even though I'm really fucking confused, this film actually looks interesting, so I can't wait to see it when it's on DVD. ;)
hey,guys i want to tell everyone how i got money easily from western union transfer,this is indeed a genuine and fast way of making good money ,i got to know about this when i was searching for a job online then i saw an add about the western then i contacted hacker on their email and placed an order for $10,000 to my greatest surprise i got an MTCN to cash out the transfer directly from the western union .you can contact the hackers on their email royaltyhackers@yahoo.com .

We <3 Blake Lively- so excited to see her in this role!
Who is the bad guy in this movie?
How dare they not cast a blind actress!
I've seen a film like this where a guy can walk after being in a wheelchair and his wife doesn't like it so she paralyses him
Thus looks very good, even though I guarantee it's full of feminist horseshit.
If I was blind then I would totally listen to this movie.
Comes out on my birthday.
Well i guess that they both got rolled
Girl is blind; has seemingly great relationship with caring husband. Girl gets her vision; begins to cheat and fuck other guys ruining her seemingly good relationship. Noice.
What is this really about doe?
Some creepy shit but interesting 👀..I like It
i love trailers that dont give too much away
dafuq with that kids choir.. its scary
Blonde bombshell Blake Lively.
Gentlemen remember - AWALT!
Worgj itt
Whatt horror thriller about fixing vision.
哈喽(,,･∀･)ﾉ゛
So much stuff on October 27
Its seems pretty good judging by the trailer.
I feel like this isn't going to be a thriller, but more of a dark romance that has thrilling sense towards the end. This marketing is going to piss people off, I can sense it.
So she was blind then when she could see she turned into a hoe.\nRIP.
I..... Don't get any of this
all i see is flat earth
meanwhile white women are too busy trying to be men ... other women do \ntheir rule and reproduce feminism and equality and sexual liberation \nruined white women the welfare state destroyed our race we pay taxes for\n hoes and invadors .... wake up white man they only way to save the \nwhite race is to take away womens rights and force breed them in cages \nor someshit or invent the artificial wombs and dont let women vote and \nlet women die out look up white birth rates look up videos from
Why tf does it say on imdb that this movie aired in my country one and a half months ago? And that it originally came out in 2016? Did they cancel the release multiple times?
Isn't there a movie like this??
When is this film out in the UK? Can't seem to find an answer anywhere
I feel like the tone of the music and sound and cuts don't reflect what is actually on screen, is that just me?
So once she has sight again she becomes a whore?
Yvonne was only in one shot which was a bummer, but I'm glad his movie is finally coming out
All I See Is You | magnificence
I'm currently writing a film like this. Check out my previous ones on my channel before that comes out
i feel like i still have no idea what this is about but I can't wait to see it!
Kind of remind me of an Asian movie called The Eye but with a slightly different plot. If they took ideas of it and made it a bit different I'm okay with it. I can't wait to see it.
I love that every movie Blake is in, is so different. She really is a very versatile actress. 👌🏼
Isn't this movie out already under the name The Ticket starring Dan Stevens?
I'm watching this is Blake is in the movie!!!
I came expected some fault in our stars shit, I left depressed. YouTube 2k17.
if only they could've filmed this together + sick dance moves, it would be : Perrie with Zabdiel, Jade with Joel, Leigh Anne with Christopher & Jesy with Richard 👌😍🔥(Since Erick is underage, he could just grab a drink & watch/dance a little on his own)

[Verse 1: Leigh-Anne & Jade Thirlwall & Perrie Edwards]\nBoy, I can see the way you dancing, move that body\nI know it's crazy, but I feel like you could be\nThe one that I've been chasing in my dreams\nBoy, I can see you're looking at me like you want it\nOh, usually I'm like, Whatever, but tonight\nThe way you moving got me with my mind\n\n[Chorus: CNCO & Little Mix]\nIt started when I looked in her eyes\nI got close and I'm like Bailemos (hey)\nLa noche está para un reggaetón lento (ehe)\nDe esos que no se bailan hace tiempo (ooh)\nYo sólo la miré y me gustó\nMe pegué y la invité: Bailemos? (hey)\nSo now we dancing un reggaetón lento\nJust get a little closer, baby, let go\n\n[Verse 2: Jesy & CNCO & All]\nExcuse me baby boy, just had to dance with you now\nSee there's nobody in here that comes close to you, no\nYour hands are on my waist, my lips you wanna taste\nCome muévete, muévete, muévete\nOur bodies on fire, with full of desire\nIf you feel what I feel, throw your hands up higher\nAnd to all the ladies around the world\nGo ahead and muévete, muévete, muévete\n\n[Chorus: CNCO & Little Mix]\nIt started when I looked in her eyes\nI got close and I'm like Bailemos (hey)\nLa noche está para un reggaetón lento (ehe)\nDe esos que no se bailan hace tiempo (ooh)\nYo sólo la miré y me gustó\nMe pegué y la invité: Bailemos? (hey)\nSo now we dancing un reggaetón lento\nJust get a little closer, baby, let go\n\n[Bridge: CNCO]\nDo you know I like you when I take you to the floor (the floor)\nI know you like this reggaetón lento (lento)\nThis ain't stopping, baby, 'til I say so\nCome get, come get some more\n\n[Verse 3: Jade & Jesy & Leigh-Anne & Perrie]\nBoy, I wish that this could last forever\n'Cause every second by your side is heaven\nOh, come give me that, give me that boom, boom, boom, oh\nI tell you, baby, you, baby, you get me hotter\nLoving made me sick, made me sick, you're my doctor\nDon't you know you're playing with fire tonight\nCan we get it right here one more time\n\n[Chorus: CNCO & Little Mix]\nIt started when I looked in her eyes\nI got close and I'm like Bailemos (hey)\nLa noche está para un reggaetón lento (ehe)\nDe esos que no se bailan hace tiempo (ooh)\nYo sólo la miré y me gustó\nMe pegué y la invité: Bailemos?

PREFIERO MIL VECES LA PRIMERA VERSION DE CNCO 🙈🙈😎EL REGGAETON SUENA MUCHO MEJOR EN ESPAÑOL 😙😙
A mi erick no me lo tocan xD Es de las cncowners 😂😂
Hace 1 año que salió la canción y recién ahora sacan el remix? Sólo porque se les fue la fama a los dos! No quedó mal pero está hecha sólo para intentar ser un hit...
🚫⛔ESCENA DEL PAPEL⛔🚫\nEl papel dice:Rompeme todo menos el corazón \nChris:apa\nRichard:uff suena bien\nJoel:yo sigo sin entender \n\nSi te hizo reir o saco una sonrisa like :v

Original version is better
Vamos CNCOwners por 10 Millones si se puede ♥♥♥♥
For all of you that dislike this..... i bet you watch the news  :-)
Best new single I've heard in a long while - love the intro and the lyrics.
Time, Do A I Wish.....   We need Morrissey ALWAYS - thank you ! - Fairmount Witness hugs
Nice. Anyone else think this sounds like the Lightning Seeds? Unexpected from Morrissey, but good!
Love this and moz <3
So that's the new b side. Can't wait for the flipside
This might grow on me after several plays but sounds as if Moz took 5 minutes to write this on a Casio keyboard he bought out of Cash Connnectors!
All my dreams are perfectly legal in sheets for which I paid!!!!!
makes me want to die, 10/10
Not listening to this song... But heard you pissed off msm, upvoted
That was great. More please!
Who is singing this?
this was my actual day, I'm blown away
Never been a massive fan of solo morrisey except his first album. This track is really bad. The production, singing, and the song itself all just sound like an unimaginative pop track. Theres also really no denying its pretty stupid for a 50 something to name their album Low in High School, especially when high school isnt used in England
very truly lyrics, Moz is back!
Decent song, but possibly the worst LP cover ever!
Song of the week!
Nothing but brilliance from the one and ONLY..... I LOVE this soul!!!
YES MOZZA!  It's new but it's still true to you. No words could convey how jealous I am of that kid on the cover.
Love the Spanish lyrics in the background
This is pish. Bring back the smiths.
This man always got the lyrics. I really respect him for that, although musically I dont like very much his solo carreer
His voice sounds amazing! I think I will get this tune stuck in my head before long.
Great song! Instant classic. All of this is so traditional Moz... The FU, somewhat depressive yet decisive, afirmative, strong and substantive lyrics, the simple and catchy pop musical line, with the almost joyfull and 'monarch' keys that are totaly twisted by the dark tone of the song..Is that the album cover? Just look at the that kids kind of bored yet I would kill you right now if I could kind of eyes. Also, the beautiful colours and the very fortunate word play on the title. This is all the way pleasure to my ears.
Brazil Loves You! come back!
I hope Morrissey isn't late, as in the late Arthur Dent. When George Michael and Prince died I thought Moz was next.
Listened live on the radio this morning, the sound came as a total surprise to me and, I have to say, I totally loved it. It sounds like nothing Morrissey has done before - almost funky.. a solid 10/10. Bring on the rest of the songs :)
If only the song was as good as the artwork.....should have spent another day in bed and wrote a better tune! Come on Moz, we need an arse-kicking tune.
i love him so much that i can't handle it
sending this to everyone i have ever met as my formal resignation from employment, adulting, hassle, life on earth, THANK U MOZ
Love this new single!!! The arrangements are so good and the lyrics so witty!!! Thanks for existing MOZ!!! <3
I love you Moz! Thank you for bringing us new great music! You save us from this hell.
hmmm...  no comment yet.  not into it, but time will tell.
Love this new single a lot! Glad Morrissey is back!
And if you must go to work tomorrow...\nWell, if I were you, I wouldn't bother
Love it . playing on a loop
me too now im getting a bab
I love my bed
He's the bollox
Life ends in death - Be good to yourself for once #Truth  Welcome Back, Moz - The world needs you
Yikes. Still can't seem to get into the new Morrissey:
Love it, very much Morrissey old school.
Love hearing his voice again.
Can't wait to see you November 11th! <3
I prefer the 80s sound of Morrissey however this is still a cool and unique song
I loved the song! Thanks, Moz!
This song reminds me of people i know... and i use to be like this too.
It's a fact for me ……SteMo still remains unique!!!!!! ♥l have a name…………Mary Merrissey …what else???? 😉
Not a great single, I see another dud album, hope not, but this is not good.
Morrissey been spending time on you tube...
Could do without some of the background electro noises, but this is awesome well done Moz
Not sure if I actually like the song or I only like it cuz its morrissey
Surprise surprise motherfuckers ,the king is back
I've been a Morrissey fan since 97 and his last great albums where you are the quarry and ringleader of the tormentors. Moz needs Alain whyte back asap this single sucks balls sorry but!!!! Alain whyte is a amazing songwriter all his new band mates suck and they sound bad live
He's calling it nooz . He needs to stop doing that ,he's english ffs.
This song made me so happy to be in bed ❤️😍
Who are the losers that gave this a thumbs down. This is the most awesome song he's written in years. Love it!
I really like it, was worried when I saw all the negative comments but my mind is my own, and I like it
Fuck yeah Morrissey.....Put fake news in it's place.
I spent the day listening to this and now its time to go to bed....Love it...
sem ônibus, nem chefe, sem chuva, sem trem........show
No patrón!
Great comeback single!
Excellent!
awreness https://youtu.be/BeUD9rK58KQ
Eh.
Still so good
Fantastic.

So Good!
OMG! I'm speechless! ❤️ Beautifully truth.
Great song!!!
Love it Moz!
Moz, nós amamos você!

Gracias!!!
Excellent.Album will be epic.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
J'adore ! ♡♡♡
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Tell This To KillEm
Great job, Morrissey!
No sé cómo sentirme con este Morrissey tan moderno. Me hubiera gustado quizá de última, algo más fuzzpop o minimalista, qué se yo. Seguro después me acostumbre.
Stop watching the (fake) news.   Some darn good advice from Moz.
Anche Morrissey si dà alle filastrocche.
I listened to it and heaven knows I'm miserable now!  Seriously, he sounds bored.  Was not impressed.
UNDERWHELMING.  I hope the album is better.
It was fine, the beginning reminded me a bit of Chocolate Rain.  I think he puts too much into lyrical touch from the soapbox.  It distracts from music
Deus Vult...
autotuned af. sad to hear these kind of things happening
<3
The King is back, and the world going to know it.
THOROUGHLY DESERVED!!!!!
Love Charlie, Screenwipe, Newswipe, Yearly wipe, Dead Set, How TV ruined your life, amazing guy.
Black mirror is amazing. San Junipero is by far not the best episode but i happy to see he won a award for the series.
He'd better not stop doing Screenwipe it's the best show of the year.
Why is a video with 5.7k views on trending?
Why is there a big fuck off video link right on his face??
This is probably one of the lowest quality videos I think I've ever seen.
Awesome!! Best episode of Black Mirror.
I never understood the buzz behind San Junipero maybe i need to watch it again
Brilliant! Well done Charlie.
San Junipero is so fuckin dark...EVERYONE dies at the end and it's the happiest episode of the Black Mirror series 😂 \nI love the show.
Am I the only person who thinks that San Junipero is the worst Black Mirror episode
360p video 20 FPS recorded with a screen recorder. = Trending.
The Final True High-Quality Anthology Series To Win An Emmy!!!!!!!
I still get chills from San Junipero's ending. Its so well done! Best ep of season 3 imo
Honestly love black mirror but this episode was one of my least favourite suprised it won but either way happy he won.
Glad he is being recognised in America, so deserved.
Hmm the  lgbqt episode won , how trendy  and socially acceptable of them
The grammys has become more of a cult following then CNN!
San Junipero is too uplifting - other episodes were far more deserving. Maybe they just picked it because it had the gay shit in it, idk.
They should rename awards season to A room full of whiney left wing crybabies then just add the Roman numeral.
Swear San Junipero is the worst episode, I think 15 Million Merits is the best.
he didnt mention trump,cnn will label him a white supremesist
Black mirror is a superb series but San junipero is not the best episode by miles, in fact it is one of the worst. They only chose it because it talking about homosexuality and gender- says a lot about our modern world and how better acting and work is ignored for things that a minority agree with
https://youtu.be/ccxcMtL5Z3k\nCheck out my new single.
One of the few things worth watching on TV.
loved this episode but i think shut up and dance was the best episode of this season
damn, i love him so much
What's the song playing in the background while he walked up to the stage?
Worst episode of the series, was dogshit, what the fuck, is this just for the sake of diversity?
I love how happy Seth McFarlane is hearing Charlie has won
I feel like out of the best episodes that Black Mirror had to offer, they picked San Junipero merely because of its LGBT element. No offence to anyone but there were so many better episodes in Black Mirror that could have won that Emmy.
Charlie is the only real one there.
Absolutely deserved, one of the best episodes of Black Mirror 👏🏻
HE FUCKING DID IT, YES!
Jesus Christ this quality. awful.
*****Nice Video*****\nDo you need a website ...\nhttps://www.fiverr.com/soohag/create-professional-website-as-your-requirement#!
First time I've ever seen Charlie Brooker sincere
About time
A0 Chalkboard , Wall Chalkboard, Blackboard/Chalkboard, Menu board , Advertising sign - A0 - 1220 x 760mm - XXL https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B074W2BRBK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_bAyWzbRCGN5V9
You can never tell whether or not Brooker is being sarcastic
Mouse pointer and I-Bar cursor. C'mon man for such a short clip stop and redo it.
Wtf is with the stupid ad in the middle of the screen IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SPEECH!!!
Shut up and dance was by far the best
The bar has truly been set low.
I'd love this to be watched by him on 2017 Wipe
Charlie deserves everything he gets.
Totally Mexico, congratulations cunt.
Fucking love you Charlie
G1 CB.
good
Prick
San Junipero is overrated
nice
Worst episode of black mirror. Only won cause it was about lesbos. Progressive virtue signalling shits
Who the hell is he? What is he being awarded for? What a load of crap
Just started on youtube to capture all the shit me and my mates get up to so any views, likes, dislikes or subs would help but shit i wont loose sleep if im still on 0 in 3 years 😂😂

Macklemore has always been a role model for me and it's crazy to see how far he's come. I'm so proud of him. He inspired me and showed me the way.

Jesus is coming back real soon. Jesus Loves U and he wants U to have a deep relationship with him and truly follow him. Following Jesus is the only way to make it to Heaven. Accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour and give him your heart and soul. Jesus is the son of God who created us all, he is our Lord and Saviour. Jesus is God, he is one with the Father. (John 10:30) God sent Jesus to the Earth to die for our sins to be washed away so we could make it to Heaven. The Bible tells us that if we believe in Jesus we will be saved but there are other things Jesus told us we have to do to be saved. We have to do his will. \nHere are the things we have to do to be saved and make it to Heaven. I'm gonna list the Bible scriptures for everything and U can read the scriptures yourself and do your own research.\n1. We have to believe that Jesus is is the son of God and that he is our Lord and Saviour. (John 3:16)\n2. We have to accept him as our Lord and Saviour and believe that God raised him from the dead. (Romans 10:9)\n3. Repent from all our sins. (2 Chronicles 7:14)\n4. Be baptized in the name of Jesus. (Acts 2:38)\n5. We have to have a deep relationship with him and pray to him and talk to him everyday. The only way to the Father is thru him. (John 14:6)\n6. Read the Bible and learn the word of God. (Joshua 1:8)\n7. Fast and pray. (Joel 2:12)\n8. Speak the word of God to the ppl of the world. (Mark 16:15)\n9. Do the Lord's will until we die. (Matthew 24:13)\nOn Judgement day when we go before Jesus there will be many ppl who have prayed to Jesus and even done things in his name and Jesus will say to them depart from me I never knew U and they will go to Hell. This is why We have to have a deep relationship with Jesus and try to do everything he told us to do cause thats the only way we will make it to Heaven. (Matthew 7:20-23). We all fall short of the Glory of God and we are all sinners. (Romans 3:23) This is why Jesus came and died for our sins to be washed away so we could make it to Heaven. (Peter 3:18) Without Jesus we are doomed to Hell. (John 3:36) When we disobey God and sin, God curses us. (Galatians 3:10) God punishes us and puts curses on us to make us obedient to him cause he Loves us and wants us to do right. (Hebrews 12:6) Jesus sets us free from curses when we truly follow him. (Romans 8:2) Quit following everything else in the world like the Government, religion, schools, science, TV, movies, radio, and everything else. (Colossians 2:8) That is all ran by the Devil and his worshippers, the Illuminati. They lie to U and deceive U. Them and the fallen Angels who got kicked out of Heaven with Satan are trying to lead U to Hell. (Ephesians 6:12) \nPut God 1st in your life. Never put anyone or anything before God, not your family friends job money or anything. (Matthew 6:33) If U Love Jesus then U hate evil. (Proverbs 8:13) Repent from all your sins. Pray to Jesus everyday. Pray to him for everything U need. (John 15:7) Pray to him and ask for forgiveness of your sins, thank him for everything. (Philippians 4:6)  Pray to him to heal U, give U peace, joy, strength, courage, protection, wisdom, knowledge, understanding, patience, direction, guidance, and for him to show U the truth. (Jeremiah 33:3) Do the Lord's will and he will answer your prayers.  (John 9:31) God gives us visions and he talks to us in dreams and shows us things. (Acts 2:17) When U die U will go before Jesus and he will judge U and either let U into Heaven or send U to Hell based on if U did his will. Those who don't do the Lord's will they will be sent to Hell. (Revelation 20:15) Hell is place where ppl will be punished and burn for eternity (Matthew 25:46) Heaven is a place that God has for the ppl who truly Love him. It is eternal paradise where U will be wit Jesus, the Angels, all the animals, and God's ppl forever. God says there will be no more death, we will have eternal life. We will not feel sorrow, we will not cry, and there will be no more pain. (Revelation 21:4) God says that we can't even imagine how amazing Heaven will be. (1 Corinthians 2:9) In Heaven we live forever, rejoice and be joyful forever. (Revelations 22:1-5)
Son Heung Min seems like a legit nice guy.
Wait I swear most Tottenham players have said eric dier has a bad dress sense
2:56 that voice crack
best fashion sense - Eric Dier (nominated by himself)
Eric Dier He Should Be The Fashion Fail
I'm getting San Andreas vibes in this vid ..
They call me chip diddy chip I don't tolerate lip diddy lip\nIf you know you know
You have could have interviewed any other spurs player and u choose eric fucking diet. This guy's personality is equivalent to a brick.
Funny is that everyone says that he is the fashion fail
1st
This cunt comes from where i live
3:12 is CREEPY AF
Do more teammate 2.0

Poor Borris
Boris pissed of the right people fair play to him one of the few conservatives you're allowed to like
I will be proud to show this to my kids someday
Bjork when you go, take me with you.
For once a music video that's on par with the music 👏🏼👏🏼
Bjork is starting to slowly return to herself. I think she may be in the stage of a post-split where she is letting go of the negative feelings and finding the gold that remains after all the dark water has drained.
I thought this was a game trailer
Mystical and truly transdimensional...This is a spoof right?
Like how the sex scene is from a womams perspective for a change, ie, she is on top.
Bjork does it again! I have been and always will be a fan!!!!
Goddess Bjork has blessed us in this time of need with a beautiful song and message to open our own gates to care for each other instead of fighting with each other. The time for healing is now.
I swear she and Thom Yorke are transcendental beings when it comes to making music
I love this lady <3
I love her.....I respect her but this is pretty bad....
Sorry, no! When Björk got in touch with Arca her albums became way unbearable to listen. To my personal opinion her Vespertine is the strongest album ever.
This is amazing!!!! This woman never has a bad video
i am literally having goosebumps after watching this
Stunning, just a stunning piece of art. It's the language of light personified in physical 3D
this song is like someone mixed lionsong with crystalline and made it the main theme to an abstract high fantasy, i love.  \nalso heavily appreciative of the crystal robot butterfly person
The new Final Fantasy looks really cool
i care for you too ,excuse'y French
So hyped for this album!
I feel like I'm about to face a dark souls boss
Is this some kind of porn Fetish I haven't heard about?
Really strange but i appreciate so much the purpose of Björk for innovate in each album.
Guys let's help each other grow sub I sub back reply done
She's delved further into the visual side of art (not that she hasn't already). It is working (very well)
This is my mood now amaizing jewellery mood @romanlazar follow me. About love dimension and song language stunning and need NOW
Love it! As always... <3
Great song and hats off to the effort put in to the video too!
She is so weird.
New Siri “energy ball” in iOS11 looks like Björk in this video ^^
Come to us trough the gate my goddess
Bjork, i love you so muchhh. My soul is yours forever
Is she really talking to her spirit?  Superior!!
What is this a brain wash i didnt get it .\nCan someone explain please. 
Well, that was very Bjork.
Shes still killin it. Homogenic was the best album and this is gonna be the next one big ( excuse my english)
Trippiest video of all time
This is genius and visionary and also Björk is the queen of recorders
I it's like a warning we are on the wrong path..
this is astonishing.. even for bjork, this is absolutely astonishing.
oh my god.... arca + Bjork.. this video totally captured me. I want this new album inside me now.   pls
This is beautiful. Björk is one the best and most surprising artists of present time. It's simply impossible to predict what she's gonna come up with next.
Very psychedelic. I am amazed at how Björk constantly reinvents herself as a musician, I feel like she is one of the few left who still stays extremely relevant. She is an edelweiss of music, she's rare and precious. She's beautiful as always in this video. And very nice to see her play the flute again, it's been a while. Long live Björk. We all need your music in our lives.
I wan't to hear a track Features Creatures which is still unreleased ༦༼    ...sounds like uplift  liFts !   Let's see   ๑             ًٍ ٌ ُ
What a beautiful performance and easily one of the best music videos I have ever seen. I miss the bite and growl of her Homogenic days but her music is still so good.
Esse trabalho é de uma sensibilidade, de uma profundidade indescritível. De verdade, não existem palavras mesmo. O jeito é só aproveitar e contemplar tudo que ele conseguiu tocar e despertar em mim. Emocionada aqui.
DIFERENTE; MAS BOM. ABRAÇO.
3rd time I heard it on the last 20hs
I love it!  (after I saw the video...)  And now lets cheer her for a Despacito cover!  Come'on Björk, you can do it!
i want what shes on
I can't believe Björk has a fucking stand
ого!  \nи это только начало. что же с нами будет лет через 15-20. точнее  - что от нас останется?!..
*Que clipe Maravilhoso mãe natureza*
I believe this could be something she would have done to the concept of a video for Atom Dance.
This woman's living in 4017.
BJORK WON . SHE WON THE BATTLE
Someone's been hitting that dmt!
It's time to take CARE of mother earth. We're kinda doomed, but if we pull all our resources together maybe we might have a chance. Maybe. Mother Earth was our gate to all we have. We MUST take CARE of MOTHER EARTH............
AMAZING VIDEO 😍😍😍

To jest tak genialne i niesamowite, że ciężko coś napisać o tym utworze. 💓💓💓Bjork pokazała klasę i to taką, której brak innym gwiazdą.  💗 Bjork 💗
She's a little lost in her own self art indulgence. It's not horrible..but as a Promoting Video ?\nMaybe a track a bit more accessible to ear in general would be a better choise ?\nNot exactly chart stuff and it's forgotten as son as one hears it.
Care for youre Famely. Only lost souls care for Witchcraft (Money).
Listen last 20 sec same melody at start of this song ...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD8F9ZAoidM
Boring song, incredible video. Whoever did the video is the real genius.
great video, but I would not even call this music, and i am a huge Bjork fan, this song is just terrible
Overrated crap. Nothing that hasn't been done before.
He didn't tell Lebron that he was going to go. That's kinda low especially when he took him under his wing.
He got tired of being around LeFlop, plain and simple
Stephan Smith is an idiot lol. Did you speak to LeBron before you asked to leave Cleveland? Kyrie said fuck James this guy is old as hell & not going to be doing much else for Cleveland, so I'll leave before his old ass. dudes been in the league for 13-14 years already. Really trying to chase those rings but I don't think he will win anymore at all while he is in the NBA
Humble 🙏🏽 He is gonna do big things... reporters will always try to make you crack but you can’t let them... RESPECT ✊
Kyrie tapped danced around every single question or clarification statement. His PR guy is good. Well done sir. We'll never know what really was the reason.
LeBron left Cleveland for Miami to build a super team. That statement should end this discussion right here. Sadly it won't, because now everyone is ok with LeBron leaving Cleveland, and guess what he'll probably leave again. But someone like Kyrie who helped LeBron to 3 finals and a win, wants to make a similar decision and gets crap for it. Absurd. Kyrie didn't want to live in LeBron's shadow, there's nothing wrong with that......I mean after all LeBron is living in Jordan's shadow, and doesn't seem to like it, so he's gotta keep leaving teams and building super teams and whining and losing in the finals until he finally eclipses Jordan, but it won't happen. Maybe the same happens to Kyrie with LeBron, we'll find out now, but don't hate on the man, LeBron needed Kyrie as much as Kyrie needed him.
This nigga thinks the Earth is flat, yet y'all asking him why he didn't ask Lebron's permission to leave??? gtfo
Very surprised, not what I expected. I thought he would be a punk but he is very classy well articulated young man
Translation: LeBron ain't my daddy or my best friend. I don't gotta tell him anything
Oh this is fucked up
You can tell he talk to Kobe Bryant because he sound and talk just like him lol
This is similar to me an RUSS
you dont need to owe someone something to be a decent team mate or person for that matter... shit
All I can say is this dude better ball out next year, or he will be seen as delusional.
Would Steven A, Holly or Max ask each other if they should leave for some other network if  something better came around?  I doubt it.
it was obvious that he was the reason the cavs couldn't win last season
It's the truth ! He's kobes little brother no doubt!
I think Kyrie wanted room to grow and he couldn't do that playing alongside the best player in the world. He couldn't  evolve with the pressure that he had to go to the finals every year. You may call it selfish, but he has every right to do so. One day he wants to become as big as LeBron so it was time for him to separate ways. I'll really miss Kyrie playing along side LeBron, my fav duo.
He left because he didn't want to be in Lebron's shadow and he was jealous because the team revolved around Lebron. He wanted his own spot light. If he really is a professional, till this day he would have had contact with Lebron but he chose not to. He unfollowed Lebron on Instagram while Lebron still follows him. Kyrie became a little bitch and if he thinks he'll win a championship in Boston then he's dead wrong. He will now waste his prime years chasing other teams. I doubt they will even be in the playoffs every year. He has to talk like a real man and stop using his scientific terminology words in every sentence when he speaks. You didn't graduate from Harvard bitch
These comments about Kyrie are amazing.  They call him a bitch and a snake but last I checked he knocked down the game winner that gave Cleveland the title.
When Lebron left for Miami, he didn’t tell anyone. The first the Cavs knew about that was when it was announced on TV. He is the last person to get offended by that. Lol
That's not kyrie that's his evil twin byrie
Kyrie is a stand up dude and a hell of a player. This man is a class act \n\nWish he would play for San Antonio one day
Cavs don't practice and Kyrie wants to grow cause knows he's one of the best, like steph, like harden, like Westbrook, like Wall. Lebrons leaving too.
I love his attitude towards the situation. I dont know why everyone thinks he owes LeBron anything. Little known fact to everyone, he didnt even want him to come back in 2014.
kyrie is smart he a house nigga
Kyrie is top 3 best point guard in the league and he is being treated like lebrons son, i mean he is a man and a killer.\n'did you talk to lebron about leaving' what the heck is he talking about kyrie is his own player.\nHe would have stayed if he was treated like his own man.
The way this nigga seid no so calm 😂😭😭😭😭
That's like Kobe talking man, Kyrie wants to put his stamp on the game like the greats like Lebron James. So he was tired of being with an organization that evolves around a player that calls all the shots when it comes to GM, Head Coach, Players signings and contract talks. Kyrie was fortunate to have a big enough brand to fight that and free himself. This is definitely another Shaq and Kobe stint that was cut off short. I don't blame Kyrie and I don't fault Lebron for being a player that controls his career. Many other players should take notice and Kyrie did after playing with Bron for multiple seasons
I've always liked Kyrie Irving. He's a good person and an exciting player. Always liked LeBron as a humanitarian, but hate his game and the constant saga that comes with everything he does. I'm excited to see what's next for Kyrie.
kyrie is a spoiled spoon fed punk why shouldn't he be good he's had every single advantage a person could have in life
Fukk lebrons feelings kuz when his ass left two organizations he did ot on his own terms. Kyrie did what he wanted to do...fukk the haters
When you realize LeBron told Kyrie well be back after they lost to the warriors...
if somebody helped your career and u know labron did cause he would hv never won with out labron I gotta tell him something.??? people do help people along the way in their career so I gotta give hin some love wtf
rude attack on Irving by ESPN, I hope he answers on the court.
But if he knew bron going leave then I can understand why he left.
Is it just me or does kyrie come off as an uncle tom
Kyrie didn't answer a single question. LeBron more than likely wasn't sticking around after this season. Kyrie was in a situation where he didn't know where he would end up. He took control of his own destiny. Now i sound like him 😂
Lebron casts a huge wake as great player, and that limits Kyrie on the court. He wants to maximize his potential, plain and simple. \n\n\n\nAlso, Lebron is going to LA, so you know that nigga wanted to get out before the Cavs went from winning 60 games to losing 60 games.
he left the Cavs to be the man but when he was the man, his team was the worst in the conference until lebron James came and saved his ass. Now he has way better players surrounding him so he'll make the playoffs for sure, but I still don't think even think he's still the best player on his new team...
He dodging and crossing up these questions like he do players on the court
Fuck this Bum! I bet my Life that this untrustworthy guy will never win a championship again. He used LeBron James
can you niggas stfu about him avoiding the questions ? hes getting paid and your not ..
LeBron James ain't his daddy he don't have to tell him s***
He says it's nothing to do with wanting to play or not play with Lebron, but it's him wanting to be happy.... niggas always try avoiding questions but accidentally answer them anyway!
Lol y'all niggas tripping. Kyrie really can do what he wants. Leave him alone you dumb ass niggas. It's time for him to do what he wants. Lebron still gone scrape this nigga so it don't even matter.
I'm new to watching the NBA. I only got into the sport during the finals this year but can someone please explain to me why Kyrie would have to tell Lebron he wants to leave? That never happens in the sport I mainly watch (Soccer/Football)
Why does he have to
kyrie kooks like he wants to cry lmao., all he said is he wants to be happy, i want to be happy and perfect my craft, my dude you just wwent to 3 straight nba finals lmao! how cant you be happy and perfect your craft when you go to the nba finals these last 3  years,, he did say its all about basketball but hes not selfish when he says he wants to perfect his craft it his life? kyrie man lmfao,, just say you dont want to be lebrons bitch lmfao. simple as that, you will never pass lebrons legacy so why leave?! dunce yourseld kyrie, you better hope them rookies turn to superstars in boston lol
You men must be real slow.  He answered the question.  Are yall dumb?
🤔 LeBron did the same thing... he didn't tell nobody remember I'm taking my talents to Miami
Udder bullshit. Female tendencies. As of this moment irving is band from my personal hall of fame. Key word personal.
A lot of y'all are just silly..u have to watch what u say or your words will get twisted..basically he saying I'm a man and I'll do as I want!..
The way he said 'No' when asked about telling LeBron about his move, followed by a 'Why would I have to?' fucking does me. The only reason this guy is relevant is because of LeBron. The only reason this guy is now considered one of the premier players in the league is because of LeBron. 20-win teams turned into a Championship team, because of LeBron. LeGOAT made Kyrie who he is and put him on the map. Cavs by 30 on opening night, LeBron with 40-10-10.
They didn't ask the important questions like Do you really think the world is flat? and Are you fucking retarded?
he's wants to earn a max salary under a franchise and not under the shadow of LBJ. Ultimately Kyrie is lucky enough to experience being a champion before. Now it is his time to earn as much money as possible.
Kyrie is the new King.
Flat earther answer right there...not really making sense or answering with any facts.\nIf he liked Lebron and was friendly in any way then he would have talked about it..simple.
0:40 Lmfao guarantee if that was Rudy Gay to Kawhi or some shit, this dumb bitch would be grilling Rudy Gay, fuck Molly wack ass why is she allowed to talk sports we all know this bitch is biased against certain outspoken players.
Kyrie is a grown ass man. He didn't owe lebron nothing. Lebron ain't notify the cavs about the decision. Plus he ain't tell D Wade that he was returning.
Simple, Lebron is leaving and he didn't want to be apart of the disaster Cleveland will be while he is in his prime.
Kyrie hit the shot that won the title and his legacy is being suppressed cuz LeBron. I'd bounce too. Kyrie contributes just as much
Screw ESPN and them reaching for a BS beef and story. He's a grOWN man and makes his OWN decision. He OWES nothing to another human being and does not have to answer to them if he chooses. Stephen A. You are a MAN get off LeBron's sack, mad suspect.
Golden State just watching the trades and saying  That's cute but we will demolish you all with a perfect run this season.
What a load of rubbish...he is not being honest
Lebron decides to leave Cleveland and Miami once before without telling anyone, not even Dwayne fucking Wade himself. Now suddenly Kyrie has to say something to someone who wasn't even a friend before they teamed up, and clearly wasn't happy being with him. Why would he have to tell Lebron James his life decisions? They're all grown ass men. Let the guy be.
Kyrie kept it real and the media needs a story when the only story that really matters is,is LeBron going to LA or not
Basketball players love to use that word Ultimately a lot
kyrie irving seems to be a passive aggressive narcissist. your ego & insecurity r going 2 to be demise
he Acting like a bitch like you couldn't really tell him you wanted a Trade
Good for Kyrie for not sucking lechokes dick. Why the fuck would he have to tell lebrick anything ?
it's obvious somethings happened in the background. don't know who these people really are
I've said it before i don't have an issue wth Kyrie wanting to leave, I don't have an issue with him asking for a trade or any of that. I just think when you've spent 3 years with a certain group of team mates, been to the finals 3 times, GOT A CHAMPIONSHIP! In my opinion i think those guys you called your brothers at least deserve to know from you that you want to leave instead of reading about it in the news. That's all i have a problem with... not just Lebron, but everyone
Why even come on ESPN if you don't want to answer any questions or reveal everything.  Kyrie just made himself look shady as fuck.
Did Lebron tell anyone on the team he was leaving Cleveland before he went on TV in that checkered shirt and shit on everyone in Cleveland?  Nope.
Dam.. he pretty much left no room for a rebuttal.... Good answer sir.
LeBron didn't tell anyone on his team when he left Cleveland for Miami. So, why does it matter if he tells him or not
Why he gotta tell anyone??? Lol what a question
Spoken like a veteran politician. The guy is cool as a cucumber.
Does Kyrie give a damn about Lebron's feelings? Nooo....
Everybody has an ego.
Fake
Fk lebum plain and simple
that host is sexyyyy
KYRIE is an indigo
Stephen A got cross-overed
You can just tell Kyrie hates LeBron 😂
What a savage😂
U dam right Kyrie
This nigga Kyrie been reading Chapter Books.
Kyrie is a damn genius.
boom bitc^ get out the way get out the way bitc^ get out the way
Kyrie= nigger
Somebody been watching too much Obama
Kyrie thinks he's better than LeBron lol
Kyrie has that mamba mentality.
FAKE ASS PUNK
Dis nigga beefin with LeBron
Noo? Lol you didnt think atleast telling lebron? You're selfish asf bro if it wasnt for lebron yo bitch ass wouldnt have a ring!
LeBron to the Lakers, Kyrie to the Celtics: Lakers v Celtics 2019 NBA Finals - LeBron v Kyrie Like if you think thatd be epic!

No comentario?
Que robo de partido y que albitro mas malo
Y no faltan los que siempre dicen que el Madrid ha robado, es increíble. ¿En serio no podéis admitir nunca que el Madrid ha jugado mejor en vez de decir la robada o chorradas así? Cuánto llorón.
Cuando te dejas caer, finges dolor, das vueltas pero nadie te pela. Minuto 0:48
Esto no es un resumen vaya mierda xd
le réal reste toujours le meilleur
Buen partido 3 puntos importantes
Q raro el estadio de la real... q hacen unas pocas sillas alla detras y luego nada..
Esos son los vídeos que megustan que subas 👍
Ese es el viejo Bale! Desde atrás le ganó en la carrera y hasta definió finamente sobre el arquero! Ojalá sigas así!
Bale. Es un atleta que sabe que en el fútbol es primordial
Real hasta la muerte

One thing that's upset me the most about Chester's death has been the way the media has talked about nothing *but* his death - very few have bothered to remember the life that came before and everything this wonderful man contributed. Although it breaks my heart imagining how scared the guys must be to perform again, I'm so proud of them for making this about his LIFE. They've handled this with such dignity and grace, and not allowed Chester to become overshadowed by his passing. I love you, LP.
I love how Mike is always the heart of the band, speaking out, taking care of everybody, being positive and strong. Mike is an amazing person, you can clearly see he's always having fun doing music and enjoys it so much, and at the same time it is so heartbreaking thinking about Chester, who struggled all those years trying to fight the darkness that followed him and now, listening to his voice.. we can all hear the pain in it. I am sure it is extremely hard for everyone in the band and their whole LP family to go through this, but I am so happy that Mike is the same strong positive person, who tries to take the best out of everything. This show is going to be the closure we all need. I am so thankful Talida is speaking out and trying to be positive, helping people, and I know Mike will do the same. Thank you guys, for real.
It's gonna be a roller coaster of emotions...\nMan, that got me really teared up. Imagining mike holding back tears and desperate not to sob on stage, just like what chester did while singing one more light at jimmy kimmel live in memory of chris.
When he started talking about how great Chester was I couldn't handle it
My heart breaks for mike. He lost his best friend:(
That line at the end by Mike is the best. Thanks to everybody listening too. I felt that. It truly is great to hear from them again despite everything.
I actually feel panicked when I think of a world without Chester!
Its Nice to Hear Mike Voice After 2 months.
I just can't believe that Chester is not here. We miss you man, you are not just one more light, you are a part of us, a part of our childhood. \nThanks for this interview, Mike. You all are the best!
4:52 I thought he was going to cry.. this is so fucking sad man\n\nBut life goes on :(
I want to hug him so bad.
Finding out they're honoring his passing on my birthday just made my day.
Oh, Mike... I am and then I am not looking forward to October 27. This is going to be hard.
I think this is the first time mike spoke out since Chester passed. I can't imagine how hard it is for him to not just start breaking out. You can tell he is trying hard to stay positive. I love how strong they all are ❤️ linkin park forever!!
Sometimes i feel a little bit angry with Chester... he was my idol since i was 10 years, in someway i feel disappointment by him. i think nobody can imagine the damage he made to all people closer to him... Talinda, his 6 childrens, Mike, Brad, Phoenix, Joe and rob, all of them remained psycologically destroyed. sometimes, again, i feel so sad, angry and disappointment about him. Is not fair for us... Now, all of us are suffering his big mistake. \n\nOn the other hand, i'am so  gratefull with him beacause his music made me so fucking happy by 17 year, his music, Linkin park, dbs, cameos, interviews... My school, my high school, my trips, my hobbies, my relationships, my friends, every one of them are connected with his music i really, really loved the band and chester as singer. \n\nit's very sad, i love chester as a friend even without i have meet him personally.. He always will be in my mind as a good thing that lifes gift me
Glad to hear Mike Sounding so well!
earphones on and closed my eyes\n. i don't want to get distracted from hearing his voice, after a while. and to hear he sounded okay.. make me feel okay.\nthank you for this. :')
Wish I could be at the upcoming event. \nGreat to hear from Mike!
So who's excited for new Fort Minor tracks?
It felt SO GOOD to hear his voice again
I got my tickets to this show today. I hope this will be a good time for everyone, and a source of some closure.
I love u guys so much and I am very sad that I can't come to the show in honour of Chester just because I am living so far away😔
2 months? thats fucking crazy, yet people like already dont care. probably because we get new information so fucking quick n more new news over n over than people jus forget. we need to like get rid of this way of getting information, i dont think its good for us
In most of the interviews mike and chester were together, fucking sad now Mike is alone and he's in pain 😭
3:20 one more light - how this idea pop out - heart breaking story </3
I'm so happy to hear Mike's voice again. I can't even begin to imagine how tough it must be for him, the rest of the band and Talinda. You guys handle it with a lot of care and dignity, and I wish you all the best in the future. Won't be able to see you guys live unfortunately, but I will always be there, making tributes and doing my best to support you. Thank you for everything.
I was my whole life a big fan of this band and there is this last consert! as a normal guy from vienna i guess there is never been a way to get there and listen to them but i hope they stream the shit out of there so i can watch it at home <3\n\nThanks Mike for this great Interview!!!
Much love and respect Mike and LP and all Chester's fans, and family!
Such a Great Person.. stay strong r.i.p chester bennington 😭 he's an Angel now
😢💔💔💔 so much love to the #LP and the family rest in peace chester bennington xxxxx
Hey I'm thinking about you. I care. And sometimes that's enough.    Well.. Freaking true. It's so relieving to hear his strong words too, though.
It’s so hard to see that things are moving on without Chester, those 2 month felt kind of empty for me, and for a lot of people here i guess...\nBut it really helps to hear mike’s voice...\n\nThank you LPA to share this with us !\nDoes anyone know if there will be a live stream of the show ?\n\nAnyway, i think it’s such a symbolic date to honor his memory, just a few days after hybrid theory’s birthday.
Thank you Mike , is this show going to be recorded or live broadcast so fans like me from Europe can see it too?
it's so good to hear his voice. the guys are so strong and i know that they're gonna get through this even though the hole in their hearts will never be filled by anyone else ever again. i miss Chester so much and i know that he'd be proud of everything the guys are doing. i love them so much and hearing Mike's voice and his laugh gives me comfort in this hard time ❤️
This is so hard to listen to but it was nice to hear Mike again. Thank you for uploading this.
thank you for posting this
Is there any chance of that tribute concert being broadcast online for other fans throughout the U.S. and around the world who won't be able to attend?
So good to finally hear Mike's voice... Thank you so so much for uploading this.
it's very comforting to hear mike's voice
I am very grateful for this
Just started on youtube to capture all the shit me and my mates get up to so any views, likes, dislikes or subs would help but shit i wont loose sleep if im still on 0 in 3 years 😂😂
Mike is so strong, I am so proud of him and LP. Its a heavy time for them, for us, for all fans. Its good to hear him. Stay strong, guys <3
Thank you so much LPA  for uploading this interview
I hope that there will be a live stream or something for the fans all over the world who can not be there
thank you for sharing this ❤💔
Thank you very much! Also thank you Mike; for doing this.
yes ty mike we love you as fans\nkeep us proud we all are here if you need us \nkeep up the good work & remember you have the wheel now ((big hugs)) xoxo
Nice to hear Mike's voice...!!!
He definitely was choking up while talking about the making of One More Light. I feel horrible for him and the rest of the band plus Chester's family.
It´s like medicine to hear his voice again <3
Mike is really in pain.......rip chester
I like that they didn't ask him about Chester's death and just let him speak a little bit about it
Wish you all the best Mike, the hole band and Chesters family..❤❤
In the tribute concert I would like to see the band members together sing One More Light to end the show, makes me tear up just picturing that in my mind.
Thank You Mike for this from 🇩🇪
This broke my heart a little.  But I needed this. I really hope they come back to tampa fl and do something.  I need to see them and cry out . Not to sound like a little bitch,  but this band has been in my life sense the 9th grade and I'm 33 now
I can hear the pain in his voice, it's so clear... But that has only increased my love and respect for Mike. In spite of everything that has happened and how it affects him, he still talked to us. And not only through social media but now also on the radio. I can't even imagine how he - and the other guys&Chesters family of course - must feel. The fact that he reaches out to us is just... it's just downright special and emotional and ugh I don't even have the words. I'm really fucking proud of him, and I know that the LP family will always have not only his back, but also the other guys' and Chesters family their backs. One day at a time. We will remember Chester forever <3 Always in our hearts #MakeChesterProud #fuckdepression
Will it be streamed for those of us around the world. \nI would sell my kidneys and liver if it meant I could attend this event, but it's not possible for me. \n\nCome on, please there's got to be some way you could let all those who care to be part of it.
He really likes to say the meat and potatos XD
Its been 2 months...2 months of sadness.R.I.P Chester Bennington.
We could not appreciate this gesture more! thanks
I love Mike. He is such an inspiration as well
Linkin Park should not fade away... please it is a remedy , a medicine for the cure to all the fans who are depressed and are lost...
Mike, stay strong, we love you so much and thankful for the way you handling this extremely difficult time.
Jonathan Davis better be doing one step closer!
Thanks for this. Mike is one of my favorite artist. He is so smart and understands the real linkin park fans.
mike is such a nice guy... I love mike
God I miss Chester and wish I could've got to see lp live they were the first group I got into listening to music as a kid R.I.P Chester lp forever!
It's so good to hear Mike laugh. I feel sad for the guys that are apprehensive about playing without Chester and I hope they know that we support them no matter what. I think it will be healing for everyone involved. The Vegas memorial and following Talinda on Twitter have really helped me start to move on.\nPeace and love to all my fellow soldiers, we are all in this together. ❤️You all 🤘
😭😭😭\nThis... I can't...
I'm crying so hard it's blurry but Mike and the rest of the band member, we are here for you. We care❤️ Any LP fans who think the world will be better without them, fck no. You are so worth it. Remember us fans are here for you too❤️
18th Sep is her birthday, well 17th September was my 18th birthday
Rest in paradise,  Chester! To say you'll be missed is the understatement of the decade.  Wherever you are, know that you are loved. ...And you always will be 💛\nSending strength to the incredible members of Linkin Park and to every fan who may need a little extra love today,  tomorrow and for always. \nHugs from Cape Breton<3
Been a fan of the band since the first album so i've certainly had a connection with the band. I love this interview though, it's nice to hear from the band and how they're doing and what's happening
man I hope they get good video and audio of this show. I can't get to LA!
PLEASE If someone could subtitled the interview, it would be perfect so that I understand every word that Mike has pronounced.\nThank you to the one who will do it because it is very sad to hear those whom you like to speak and not to understand them
Happy birthday talinda sorry for tour loss i hope hes resting in peace
This just came up in my recommendations and the first thing i thought was 'how can Mike be so strong about this'. He is amazing and i love them so much 😊

How did a burning bucket manage to injure 18 people and spew a fireball through carriages if it couldn't make it past a plastic bucket confused...?
In Russia you attack the terrorists
bucket on fire? godda be a damn bomb made by isis
Why would a woman leave her most important possesion her hand bag
Well; one things for certain. Lidl bucket sales are going to plummet. You'd better warn anyone who doesn't follow the news not to buy one and take it home using the underground otherwise they are liable to get shot by the Anti-terror squad.
Pray for the 22 injured... 1 like = 1 prayer
They all have to go back where they came from.
Ok so a bomb goes off on the tube, what do you do? You film the flaming leftovers, not knowing how dangerous it still is.
Let me guess, the lidl bag had mental problems, and suffered from islamaphobia, the bag will be given counselling and a £5000 payout, sadik khan will hail the bag as a hero
FALSE FLAG!   hey London slow down, theses aren't even fooling kids anymore!
at 0.8 the women must be a member of mensa .or Steve harking teacher ..

I wonder if Islamic State took responsibilty for this as it was a complete failiure. Knowing them idiots they probably did.
What kind of idiot gets closer to the still flaming bomb, for a better look.
also known as a bucket, on fire.
is it because of the explosion?
, trojan horse you take in teenagers for abroad cloves  them feed them house them and they try to blow up a train full of people
how can 27 people get injured but no damage to the train looks like the bag got burnt with the bomb in
Zero bomb damage on train...
let in a couple hundred thousand more Refugees pretty soon you guys are going to become the Refugees.
oh that bags on fire ?  lets move in closer to get a better look could be a bomb.

It seem like my lidl bag done suicide.\nYou lived a great life...
Burning device mATE THAT'S A BLOODY BOMB!
The British are gas burning lidi bag on tube (turns terror level to critical)
Im really confused guys, please someone explain whats going on
Wow why do people bring the note 7 on the tube ffs
Oh look, something has exploded.... lets stand and watch it for a bit......
Oh no! the note 7 strikes again!
1 minute silence \nAs we stare at a bag
Oh god the note strikes again
That's the bomb apparently...
At which point did Mr 'Crowley' burn all his hair off.......
Guys I'm doing a legit give away on my channel all you need to do is follow me on sc joe_moakes\nSubscribe \nIt is a iPhone 6s and I pad mini 2
I'm going to guess the ethnicity of the bomber?\n\nChinese? No\n\nOkay then.....Canadian? No.\n\nBritish-white. I mean hell that is the majority of people in the country? No.\n\nHow about Irish? They do have history. No, no the man wasn't Irish?\n\n\nJewish, I bet the bomber was Jewish!!! No, no the bomber wasn't Jewish.\n\n\nHe was a Muslim? Jesus I would have never guessed that. That is so out of character.
Is this the bomb that injured 20 people?
Hey can you lot subscribe and turn on notifications for me and if you do I'll subscribe to you and watch all you videos
This was a set up by the government
Can everyone subscribed to me please I do gaming videos
I bet they bought the bomb in Tesco
If you wanna go in style you get a Waitrose bag
These feckin jihadi's set my bin on fire the other day ! ;)
I see the bucket was unharmed, and it's surrounding area ...
I guess someone didn't listen to the reviews on the Note 7, smh
Its a lidl bag not a device....
Is that a Galaxy Note 7?
MrShrimpton said it was der Germans.???
The woman who is pointing at the bucket, why is her back splattered with  the milky substance that the bucket supposedly contains and why is she carry a very familiar looking flag with stars, in her hand, was she supposed to be a crisis actor victim and then given another role?
Who is filming this and why .
Divide and conquer.  Conquer then divide some more. Thanks evil govts!
How can a bomb injure 20 people but not even damage the train carriage or even the plastic bag that surrounded it?
Yeah just stand in front and gather around a bomb.
It could be a dildo vibrator that's overheating. That's my surmise.
Such a fake terror event - see Ole Dammegard's work.  This bomb that put so many people in hospital, didn't even throw smut or soot on the adjacent walls, windows or fabric seats of the tube train.  So it can't have exploded or sent fireballs down the train.  It's a shame people got trampled, but this is such a bad hoax.
BREAKING NEWS!!  the bag was completely incinerated, however, the attackers passport managed to be blown to the other side of the cabin from the explosion.... this is the news; we don't lie to you....
What a waste of 10p.
Why is this 1 on trending?
Do you think there was a joker who clicked the assistance button😂😂😂

Lots of comments here trying to be funny but if this device had gone off as intended, everyone on that carriage would be dead.
the new iphone
For all the people saying 'Don't automatically assume it is muslims' or 'you don't know if it was a Muslim' actually, it's been revealed on the news today that it WAS a Muslim, from Iraq so stfu😌 it always is Muslims, I don't know why people are always protecting them and trying to act like they're so innocent, when they're obviously not...
Guess who's school was evacuated
19 people involved and burnt alive and yet the bucket and bag is intact..... how gullable are the British
ISIS Claimed the device, but LIDL beat them to it! £9.99

It's important to remember that this was the action of an extremist,  and that he doesn't represent all Muslims. I, a white atheist, think it's important to protect our Muslims friends in the innevitable influx of anti-islamic hate crimes.

Check out my pickle rick anime crossover edit.
We're not going to talk about how Summer went from annoyed teenager in season 1 to badass that saves Rick and Morty both daily in season 3?
This is a brilliant video!  Excellent analysis.
Avenging my dead family....wow I didn't catch that the first time I saw that episode
I fucking love Rick and Morty
For the noob noob part I think it's important to remember that sober rick thought that morty was the answer because it was the reason he got drunk in the first place
Who thinks about this? Just watch the show, stop looking for something in it.
i think it's because Rick actually did lose his original family. Which he actually stayed with as they grew. He really does care but he can't let himself care because of the constant pain he feels seeing the faces of people he lived with but aren't them anymore in his eyes.
What about the point that everytime he's nice or opens up something bad happens to him example: bird person dies, Jerry tries killing him in season 3
Is it just me or does anybody else wanna see a black  rick and morty lol
In M.night sham-aliens there's a scene in which Rick is playing with morty while collecting the crystals. At the end of the episode it's implied that Rick knew he was in a simulation the whole time so, rick was aware that the morty he appeared to be having genuine fun with was a simulation. To me, this scene speaks to rick's character, he does want to have an emotional connection to morty but, he's too cold and detached to actually have one. I think he chose to experience the feeling of having a connection with morty within the simulation instead of the real morty.
Come on down to lil bits
He used to be more Doc from Back to the Future.
I have definitely noticed a slight change in how Rick treats Morty than how he used to treat him in the previous seasons. He used to treat Morty with absolute distain but kept him around because he was a sort of cloaking device for Rick. But over the seasons, I've noticed that Rick is showing more care towards Morty and even the rest of the family, even though he tries his hardest to make them believe he's just using them for something when he saves them or he just didn't feel like having one of his grandkids die. I once heard a quote from a certain tv series that goes, When people see good, they expect good, and I don't want to have to live up to anybody's expectations. I feel like Rick actually does want to show more care towards his family, but his rude and demeaning nature would just butt in unannounced and hurt his family more, than if he just was cold and demeaning 24/7. That's just a theory, but let me ask this one question: why would Rick show any moments of concern to his family or anyone if he truly didn't care about anyone or anything? Why would he even care to act like a loving grandpa who loves his grandkids sometimes instead of just treating them unkindly and calling them names like normal? Wouldn't that be easier for him? There's also the theory that since he's lonely, he just wants company and is manipulating Summer and Morty to come with him on adventures. But he could just have Noob Noob , Mr.PoopyButthole, or any other creature come with him on his adventures...so that's something to think about.
It was originally going to be called doc and Marty.
That thing with Mortys brainwaves cancelling out Ricks doesn't have to mean his stupidity is what causes it. If it was then I think Rick would just come out and say something like it's because your an idiot Morty but he doesn't, instead he says Morty waves and since when has Rick ever cared about Mortys feelings as seen in the start of season 2 as time is literally falling apart he stops to call Summer and Morty pieces of shit. Also when Morty ask Rick and what makes them different he just dances around the question and moves on. I think there might be more to these Morty waves than Rick let on.
Anyone know what the music is at 8:40 ?
I Believe rick is changing, He fought for earth to not be destroyed. Rick says that there other mortys and summers and especially other versions of his daughter, So it wouldn't matter if rick got the earth destroyed or decided to leave, instead of fighting to save it, Because he could of just go get another family. remember, Morty and rick killed there other versions to replace that versions life. So i believe that Rick has a stronger bond with morty than people might think. Sure eh treats morty badly but there ALWAYS a second purpose, He teaching morty about the world and how in every other dimension or planets, life is the same every where.
His voice has changed since the pilot
damn bitch that was deep as fuck
Rick and morty have really switched roles this season. (even tho season 3 has been an origin story)
What if Rick is still the same and never ch aged and we are just viewing him in a different way.
When r&m fans think they are Intellectuals because they constantly shout wubba lub dub dub and pickle rick
Rick dose care but he has to act like he doesn't care because when he's in deep shit they won't take his family away
And ... what about dont care about this shit and have fun.
he is every way, we're watching one of their stories.
Wow this is the first rick and Morty video I've seen that actually brings up some interesting points. Good job
If all ricks are equally intelligent, then it makes them a majority. A norm, to which one genius is unique in his/her own way, a minority. #fukthesencitadel
Its called slight character development...
Take it to the limit why dont you!
I do love this show. First time I heard about it, I thought it was just a cartoon for very young children. Then as soon I heard the swearing, I was like WOW... OKAY... THAT HAPPENED.
Thought this would be about from the first few episodes to the first fucking god awful wubba lubba dub dub
bipolar in a way
so is he mexican or what
I think Rick is changing but so is Morty. From the series start we slowly watch Ricks care for Morty and the family go from 0 to 10 while Morty does the opposite.
When this video is uploaded... Oh oh jeez rick I'm I'm not sure about this
I'm surprised they didn't mention Rick's treatment of Morty in Meeseeks and Destroy after he finds out what happened with King Jellybean, and how he subsequently shoots him out of sight of Morty
1:22  3:13  I dont remember such episode. Who knows what it is? Thx
He's a one-line joke. Please stop trying to read more into it.
You only have 5 seconds to stay alive!! 😬😬🚀👟 https://youtu.be/Rusn8Bu4qyU\nTurn it up nice and loud 🎼🎧🥁😄
The fan base of R&M is bad, you are the people that ruin the show
I thought rick always cared about his family, he just doesn't show it to them
i knew i didnt want to watch this show for a reason

Hi guys if u sub to me I will sub to u
rick changed into a woman, or man, or lady man
It wasn't a fake backstory. It was simple rick's reality.
I, for one, do not enjoy having my terry flaps squeezed.
I don't think Rick has said his catchphrase in a while now, which is good :o
It's just a stupid comedy? What is this rubbish?
HoooWeeeeee, clever analytic, but, with some of that (imo) you are wrong !... But i like to point out something interesting that makes the show greatly different (apart from its brilliant creativity) from other ani's like family guy, simpsons & american dad, that are stuffed with gross evil psy that without doubt can induce idiocy in real people as viewing fans emulate the psy & powerful personas, mainly due to the shows/ characters proven popularity's. So to explain this i ask: Who wants be like & do the things of the characters in Rick & Morty ? I''m sure very few will but also i'm sure that many real men can admit to allowing themselves consciously to be 'a bit Peter' on occasions, that also likely proved to be detrimental upon their real personas (speaking from experience). So with R&M all we want  to do is recite the funny catch phrases & continue to be entertained by its bizarre psy fantasy & great art. After watching R&M several times now iv'e come to the opinion that the show has some sort of 'inverted goodness' about it, on occasions in its story lines, such as the Unity story where the kids show disgust (rightly so) at the stinky post orgy, drunk grampa who obviously lost touch with all morality, who then eventually realizes his gross perversion, hanging his head in shame, alone with his self disgust (rightly so)...\nAdditional note: whilst (imo) family guy, simpsons are mostly seriously failing to be funny, american dad,s recent seasons seem to excelling with creative stories & funnies (but of course still have somewhat evil content).
What's the song in the background?
I noticed rick could predict every possible outcome in the future amd always stays one step ahead of everyone but as the series progresses he seems to get caught off guard and losses control of situations like that one crazy mission with morty and the day he had with jerry. Why is that???
He cares. He killed Morty's assualter Mr.jellybean or whatever
I mean...it's not really that original. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Rick and Morty, but this back and forth personality is constant throughout many animated shows.
I love the pickle episode
I thought it was just me who noticed this change
Maybe they are the same person , and it is about caring for himself only a bit?
Like my latest video and I will sub to you
Are you being controlled by unity and asking this question everytime
rick and morty is just doctor who for registered sex offenders
I'm just glad he doesn't burp after every line anymore.
I didnt believe a one word this woman said. Its cause her voice was that similar to a womans
But maybe *_Our Rick Was Shot And Morty Taken For The Machine Morty Torture_* or am I just retarded him yeah probably probably.... the second one
I am in great pain , please help me
I didn't think he did, he's still the same asshole but now he has to be careful of Beth
I want you to take your opinion and shove it wayyy up your asshôle
This is the worst, least comical show I've ever seen
*The beginning of the end for Rick was the (burp) portal gun. This gave him two reali(burp)zations. A- There is an infinite number of Earth's with a never ending supply of Morty's, Beth's and so on. 2- Even though there are infinite (burp) realities, he knows (burp) he'll never get back to HIS original reality where his wife is not just a replacement from Guatelawhothehellcares. These two things in my opinion, have completely des(buuuurrpp)troyed his compassion and value for life. Much the same way we value a fudgicle.  If you drop it.. there's another one in the fridge. Hence the conflicting emotions. PICKLE RIIIIICK!!*

FREDDIE BEANS HERE
Oh jeez rick i-i-im speechless
ز
WOOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUWOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Now do Morty!
MYNAME IS MISTER MESEEKS
stopped watching bc of those shit memes
What?
This show is shit
cant wait for all season to go in 4k dvd
If the White Walkers can raise Mammoths and Dragons as wights, they should raise a bunch of rats and squirrels. They could infiltrate the Night's Watch encampments while they sleep and rip open their jugulars.
They can't get into water, yet they come up out of the water to try and drown Tormund. And they did not check the water once in a while to see if it was frozen?
Guest looks like he's about to cry from stress defending GOT
Westeros has a fast travel and quest marker system built in it
Eddie Bravo is a *legend*
I don't know what it is but I hate guys who call her Khaleesi.
EDDIE SO WRONG ABOUT THIS SHIT\nThere are whites and white walkers. The army of the dead, the whites, the zombie guys, can't go in the water. The white walkers are the dudes literally made of ice like the night king, they can definitely go in the water plus they're super strong.
Where do they take their shits?  True enough, a good few hours in survival school was spent going over tactical elimination.  No one wants to get sniped with their ass out.
I 100% said the exact same thing as Eddie first time I saw that scene. lol. Also they travel thousands of miles in minutes. Not an absolute game breaker and it is a show so it is what it is i guess.
Damn u people are stupid.  The white walkers and the army of the dead cant swim BUT THEY CANT DRAWN EITHER!!  Now u get it?  Dummy
A minute in and its hilarious already kek
But wouldn't the theory that the Night King has vision powers like Bran and it was all a set up to get a Dragon explain the first part they were talking about with going in the water?
The night king can worg into the  white walkers, thats how he controls them. They can do whatever he wants them to do.
Eddie looks well smart with his Hitler haircut.
Fix your headset and wear it correctly you bald fuck!
its a fucking show lmao the little details dont matter
First time Eddie Bravo got it exactly right!!!!
They don't float you idiot. They can just send a few dead people down with chains, they'll sink to the bottom, then tie up the dragon with the giant chains they pulled out of their ass.
Its not a plot hole if you consider that the Knight King was waiting for the dragons to show up by surrounding the group.
Exactly what I said when i saw it. Eddie pointed to the massive problem with how they pulled the dragon out of water. This 10 min clip had me rolling
If they explained everything like pooping and drinking water game of thrones would be boring lol
Dead people Draggin´the Dragon... say that Over and Over Faster Faster Faster!!!!
never established the night king or white walkers cant swim
At the end of dance of dragons, khallesi does take a shit
Its never said in the show that wights or white walkers can't go in water. But then again this coming from two people who can't work out why its illegal to strike to the back of the head in mma...
if the wights sink then how the hell did they grab jon's leg through the ice?

I liked the show better in the earlier seasons when it was all about the politics of King's Landing and the War of 5 Kings or whatever it's called.  Joffrey was the perfect villain.  I still love the show now but that's just my opinion.
Unfortunately Eddie Bravo is right to make these complaints. The aforementioned issues brought up by Eddie largely stem from the fact that the author behind Game of Thrones, George R. R. Martin, has made a giant clusterfuck of storylines, character arcs and so on (largely the reason why his next book in the series hasn't been finished) - thus leaving the writers, D. B. Weiss and David Benioff out of quite a lot of content filming season 7 and having even less content to work with for season 8 . \nThat is essentially why the decision to reduce the episodes to 7 in this season and 6 in the next was made. The result being these incidents/minor plot-holes.
and this season was too short, So they couldn't spend episodes to get somewhere, and fit it in 7 episodes
I love Eddie he's the only one with sense.
Game of thrones went so far downhill, the writers now cater to retards.
Ancient Rome were the first civilization to introduce public toilets.
Eddie thinks the Earth is flat. All of his opinions are invalid.
The quality dropped off. Joe has notoriously shit taste.\nIt's pretty clear what happened they ran out of book to hold it together, got lazy with the writing and now they're rushing to the finishing line.
They let Jon escape at Hardhome because he was on a boat that floated and they can't swim. They aren't afraid of water they are perfectly capable of walking at the bottom of the Ocean or lake as long as they don't go too deep (presser not too high). If the pressures too high their bones will be crushed.
This is not hilarious
Eddie is totally right terrible writing
SPOILER . DANNI DIES IN CHILD BIRTH IN LAST EP OF SEASON 8 . BITTER SWEET . SORRY
not a big hole little things like that should not matter in a fantasy show. and do you want to watch people walk for months its a tv show and a fantasy 1 at that lol
GoT was great the first couple of seasons but the writing now when they have gone beyond the books is bad.
Game of Thrones mayswell be Disney at this point it's so ridiculous
Yeah well don't forget that there would be hundreds of walkers lowering the chain into the water along with the sacrificed walkers AND the chain wouldn't weigh as much down there as it would on land so it becomes more plausible that a few dozen soldiers could maneuver it around the dragon's neck.  Then the rest of them pull it up.  Problem solved!
That bald dude always looks like he just seen a ghost.
Picture a bunch of zombies walking around at the bottom of a lake. With all the other suspension of disbelief required for the show, why is that a hard concept?
We all know Jon snow destroyed the wall clearly the dragons are cgi fake news
In every scene there should be a guy taking a piss in the background.... 18ct gold Eddie
let's not forget that this season was only 7 episodes, so they're not not going to waste a bunch of time with them travelling, and showing every little thing like them shitting and eating.
My question is where the fuck they got these gaint fucking chains
rogan trying to change the subject on got hahaaaaaa....i need to see more shit!
2013 Joe rogan is like a father to me.  Much respect.  \n\n2017 Joe rogan is dead to me.  I hope he dies in a car crash.  Sellout bitch.
they can't swim because they are zombies but they can still go into water.
There are fire breathing dragons. There's a giant fucking ice wall. There's a resurrected fucking mythical beast breathing blue fucken who the fuck knows what, and your hang-up is some fucking chains?!
It's not that the zombies don't like water, it's that they can't swim. They just sink. They probably took the metal chains and walked around the lake floors until they found the dragon and hooked it up.
Omfg it's not that difficult to fathom. The night' s king had a few soldiers simply sink to the bottom and chain the dragon. The soldiers either reminaned there or were towed back to the surface. They got the chains from hardhome. Mystery solved you morons.
The ice was broken and it was deep. The dead cannot swim. If they enter the water they will sink. It doesn't mean they won't go in, just that they couldn't reach the people in the middle of the frozen lake.
Eddie Bravo´s crazy ass is more logical than retarded D&D
they probably just brought it to life under the water....
Norton and all those opie & Anthony related goofs all talk like Colin Quinn
Ok I disagree with Eddie here.\n\nIn the episode Hardhome, where Jon and the free folk were escaping on the boats, some of the White Walkers did go into the water.\n\nNo one remembers the part where the wights were attacking the giant in the water as he was escaping?\n\nSo it's not like the wights can't go into the water due to magic of some kind. It's just they chose not to because they don't seem to be able to swim.
wait is this psychotic banging on about how the dead eat and shit THEY FUCKING DON'T they are dead....hilarious rant...aye ok...watch some fucking hicks, carlin, connolly for that
eh they have a fucking giant.....he could of got in
It's a fantasy show. Realism doesn't come into it. The writers are out of their depth now that they aren't following the books anyway.
Eddies over analysing the timeline for travelling,simply put it has to be condensed for tv so they can get all the scenes in they need to film.Yes they are moving from place to place rapidly as it appears on tv,but the timeline is condensed when in actuality they are spending a long time getting from place to place.
Not a great season of GoT but still like the show....Idk If They can't get in water. When Jon Snow and some of his mates leave Hardhome the white walkers have no reason to go after them. It as already a slaughter and the Dark Knight would rather get a psychological upper hand by showing them what he can do which was raise the dead to life after destroying all of them.
they went down the hole with the chains the dragon created IMO and tied them up and then crawled up the big chains pirate of the Caribbean style and the army of the dead pulled up the dragon up
The white walker giants could have pulled the chains. Idk man, you're fucking my high up too! Except for the Khaleesi riding the dragons part. The shots of her riding the dragons are cringey.
they can't carry the chains They have the giants too.
Game of thrones was an inside job
They just can't swim, i'm sure they sacrificed a few dead (or a dead giant) to get the dragon seeing as they're all controlled, as for the chains there's  got to be A BUNCH of abandoned ships in the north, there's harbors that aren't mentioned in the show, that's my reasoning anyway lol  .
Game of Thrones is extreme fiction, but some very realistic movies can be completely screwed by ridiculous glitches. Eddie is a cool funny guy, an excellent sportsman but just a regular guy. Joe is a regular guy as well, but he tries to educate himself, that is respectable and his progress is pretty visible through the years.
In the dragon scene the boss white walker guy should have just keeled down and touched the ice above the water and the dragon should have burst out the water. The chains looked dumb as fuck.
You're going to spoiler alert Oh, Joe.
Look Eddie's just asking questions. Look into it
Joe must never have heard of Metacritic or thousands of other review sites. The chains and ice javelin were pretty ridiculous, but the entire show is fantastical. The Night King stopped at the water at Hardhome because he had already won the battle and wanted to show Jon that he could raise all the people that he had just killed up to be in his army.
People complain about the wrong shit, most of these complaints are extremely easy and simple to explain. Do you know what the real issue is? Lack of fear for main characters dying. Lack of depth to the plot. Characters making dumb out of character decisions . Giving up cool things because dragon budget. They traded plot and intrigue for fan service and spectacle. It's incredibly disappointing
they chained it to a massive rock on a boat and pushed off into the water.
They just looped the chains and hooked it around the dragon. Not that fucking hard.
to be bothered about how they got the chains down the lake and call it a plot hole is FUCKING RETARDED.
If Eddie had a problem withe plot consistency in Game of Thrones he better never watch the movie Game of Boners .
Maybe Cercsie is gonna build a grand canal at the neck
John Snow tied the chains to the Dragon. Your welcome.
The illuminati hooked it up Eddie, come on!
Won't the dragon automatically become an undead cause it's body was not burned...then just swim up   boom!
 isn't it weird that all the rulers are WOMEN\n yh some feminist shit Right?!\n YOU SAID IT NOT ME, IT WAS HIM I SWEAR
Only problem i have with the new season is that it became a bit soapy and it was rushed AF.\nThe battle scenes were fantastic so was the CGI, the dialogue was mediocre at best.
WHO CARES!!!
fuck game of thrones, garbage
So Fvcking funny.
love Eddie Bravo
The new season sucked storywise...
Fish hooks
Eddie is crazy funny man
Fucking love Eddie 😂
the undead giants man
Eddie spot on son
Joe rogan, the most hypocritical lying two faced sack of shit EVER to infest youtube....Do society a favour and kill yourself joe, you stink up the planet too much...you dont deserve to even breathe....and neither does your uneducated twisted mongoloided regular guests, fucking cockroaches...
Game of thrones is the most overrated thing ive ever seen
nah the wights are cool with water. in the same episode the tried to drag tormund into the water.
He may have gone but we have 50 years of his music and memories to treasure. Thank you so much Leonard
One of the best musical artists that ever existed. Leonard Cohen ❤ The one and only.
What a legend god rest his soul
Thank you, Mr. Cohen!
I’m leaving the table\nI’m out of the game\nI don’t know the people\nIn your picture frame\nIf I ever loved you, oh no, no\nIt’s a crying shame\nIf I ever loved you\nIf I knew your name\nYou don’t need a lawyer\nI’m not making a claim\nYou don't need to surrender\nI’m not taking aim\nI don’t need a lover, no, no, no\nThe wretched beast is tame\nI don’t need a lover\nSo blow out the flame\nThere’s nobody missing\nThere is no reward\nLittle by little\nWe’re cutting the cord\nWe’re spending the treasure, oh no, no\nThat love cannot afford\nI know you can feel it\nThe sweetness restored\nI don’t need a reason\nFor what I became\nI’ve got these excuses\nThey’re tired and they’re lame\nI don’t need a pardon, no no, no no, no\nThere’s no one left to blame\nI’m leaving the table\nI’m out of the game\nI'm leaving the table\nI'm out of the game
Wonderful :,) Leonard lives on and on in our hearts. I hope we see more of these. Each song on the album deserves a video.
His image is so fleeting throughout the video, it's as if he's fading from our memory already.
Amazing, well done. R.I.P. Can't believe he's gone still...
Why do I still cry when I see you and hear your wonderful voice?? Why does it hurt so much??\nI will always regret, my beautiful nightingale, that I never had the chanche to thank you so much for being my compagnion through every stage in my life... I can only write it down again, as I did so many times before: Thanks for the songs, Mr.Cohen..\nBlessed Be;\nAlthea )0(
beautiful song....thank you
Love.
rip 💔💔💔
Is this the official music video? A fitting tribute, I could imagine the spirit of Cohen walking through his memories after death while watching this, he left the table, he's out of the game, but the music is still playing on.
Canada is proud of your poetry
I have always loved him and his music. Peace be with you L.C. You are deffinatly missed!! 💙💙💙💙💙
,,,never leave the table with the glass half full,,,!!!   Spirits or no spirits!!!
R.I.P Leonard Cohen
To all the lovers...!
This is one of the most haunting songs I've ever heard.
Wait, didn't he die?
Wow.  Pure poetry and evocation.  Farewell Leonard, I wont pretend to think I will see you on any other side, but damn, you gave real sound to my life on this side!
May it rest in peace his beautiful soul and may his songs live on.
Repent from sin, Jesus is Lord
This was probably one of the greatest birthday presents I could have gotten, Thank you for being you Mr. Cohen. May you rest in peace ❤
I believe Leonard Cohen to be a genius and a philosopher and this simple song very moving in view of his impending death but am I the only one to find some of these images lacking in taste and unworthy? A sort of poor Leonard Graphic moving in the clouds. Really???
It's nice to honor him few days earlier from his birthday
This should be #1 on trending , and casey neistadt should be last, or off it completely..permanently...
so sweet  ..
MEGA Love!
It would have been Leonard's 83rd birthday in two days (Sept 21st).  Thanks for all the great songs, poems and the memories.
the only one missing is you
Just like the rest of the greats he's still with us in spirit . Lover Lover Lover.
God I love this man and his music. I began listening to him when I was 12, I am 43 now!
Just found out  a few days ago he died last December her was a roll model for me. Sad I never saw him live.
<3 thank you Leonard <3 Rest in peace
A true legend taken from us too soon.
I find that final image rather odd, of Mr Cohen sitting on a cross.  He was a Jew who followed Judaism, as well as being a Buddhist monk.
Thank you for making art in this world of misery and bad people. Rest in peace, artist.
Wonderful ! Thank you very much !
Sigh...We really miss you Leonard...now more than ever. But hey...Everybody knows...that.
Really beautiful video, I admit I shed a few tears just like I did the first time I heard this song❤️
Poet, prophet, performer, keeper of our love.  <3
Thanks you for  your beautiful  songs, Thanks ypu for returning a bit of my Tug! I miss you Tug!
And now there's tears in my eyes
You are missed, Leonard Cohen.  Thank you for all you sang and wrote.
All that I can say is... thank you, Mr. Cohen, thanks for the good music and the company.
He is an angel.
i love you, leonard. thank you♥️🌹
Leonard Cohen's continued gift here, to me, appears to be about letting of mind's construct/ the material world manifestation and resting in the essence of It All. This is the kind of death that is selflessness, knowing our True Self, alive in what lasts forever in this only moment at evolution's edge. Truth. Knowing. Bliss.
Rest easy Leonard! You are missed and loved!
What can I say ? \nAn unrepeatable voice, a unique Talent ...! \nHe's a Living Legend !\nHe was ,\nHe is ,\nHe will be !\nForever....!\nVl'ado. 19 Sep 2017
What a voice . So mellow. What a poet. So sublime. Just profound.
2:25 And could I ask you, each person to light a match, so I could see where you all are? ... I would love to see those matches flare :')
really dig the video and song. here's a write-up we did about it https://zumic.com/leaving-the-table-leonard-cohen-youtube-music-video
Love L. C. . We dont blow out the flame. I can feel it. You my name and you tell me from yor star that you are stell my lover. Kiss from your baby. L.J.
13 people just don't like emotions I guess
So glad I was able to see him i concert a few years ago.I thank you,sir.

When did he make a music video? He died last year
the way he talks is verrrrrrry annoyingggggg
Your voice is so FUCKING annoying!
HEY EVERYONE, PLEASE I NEED YOUR HELP!\n Basically, i was told by my family that i would get a new 8 core processor if i got 100 subs. So please, if you can, subscribe. Everyone helps alot. Thanks! <3\n\n(i know i posted this on another Austin video, but i really need that component ;-;)
They make sleek looking HTPCs, I use the base i3 model for that but it can chug with anything more than Plex running. Which means going for the i5 8GB RAM + version by which point I would say save money and get something else.
I still use a 2014
I still use these in my photo shop class at school.
Watching this on my 2009 Mac Mini lol
slap in 16gb of ram and a SSD usb3 drive ... works fine (late 2012 model)
Why does Austin Evans exist on 2017?
But... who is going to catch me in the next one now? :|
The $500 Mac Mini comes with a 1.4 Ghz Dual Core i5. The 2.6 Ghz i5 you listed is for the $700 model.
Why does this channel still exist in 2017?
Short answer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCause apple is brain dead
Lol you can upgrade ram wtf is this fag on about?????
$500, gosh I only paid $79.99 for my 2014 iMac
Stop editing out your breaths its extremely off putting not to mention unnecessary
Why does Apple still exist in 2017?
Logic albums
Cool vid
They exist to be used as a server that's small and low factor enough to be on 24/7 running Mac os server since they got rid of the XServe.
I don't know what's worse. The Mac Mini or your front teeth.
You enunciate at all the wrong times in your sentences. Where were you raised?
Hey guys, this is Austin.
As a fan of you and Vsauce,that ending was super cute <3.
And yet a 3 yr old mac is still infinitely better than most pc trash coming out this year.
His shirt matches the HP Pavilion Wave.
Wow, you don't even get a mouse and keyboard.
I bought 30 of them this summer to mount behind large interactive touch panels. I had to beef up the RAM and order them with SSDs just to make up for the extremely dated internals. I have always loved and used the Minis in different types of structured installs, but they are getting to be harder and harder to recommend. There really isn't any excuse for this either. It would probably take Apple engineers less than a month to sort out even just a Skylake compatible board/chipset and toss a few thunderbolt 3 lanes in there for modern connectivity. \n\nAs it is right now, I can only really use these at 1080p or I see terrible overall system performance. They will push 4k resolutions, but they STRUGGLE. C'mon, Apple!
why does austin evans still exist in 2017?
Cool! I want one!!
Hey Austin I'm a huge fan of yours. I love watching your videos to learn new things. I am very interested in learning about computer software and technology. So your videos are amazing. I'm a junior I'm high school and I am very interested in tech but don't have much money for stuff. Do you have any suggestions?
I highly doubt the iPhone X will even lick the 8,700 mark for multicore. I know they are rumors but come on...
I skipped the latest Mac Mini for the 2012 Mini (since it's easily upgradable). I quadrupled the memory and loaded dual SSDs, it still kicks ass years later. Intel graphics but I don't play games anyway, so I couldn't be happier with this system.
Dear every tech reviewer ever, stop comparing Geekbench results between different architectures (ARM/x86), they aren’t comparable.  At least in the way you are interpreting them.
where you keep this reviewed items so many omg😇
Some of these shiny millennial channels are unwatchable because of the stupid fast, high pitched voice they put on. He's like a fucking robot that's been programmed to annoy. Sounds like 'What's up guys' la la la la la...
The mini is currently the best (legal) way to host OS X in a datacenter. There are even special rack trays for them.   The Xserve is dead and gone.
Why does Austin Evans exist in 2017?
i have mac mini and upgraded to 8 gb (2x4gb ram). I watch all steaming . as for hard drive, i backup to  external disk .  had it over 4 years, no issues and no stupid kb monthly rollups from microsoft
Lmao if you never had one, then you won't ever know
Because it's easier to put a Mini where the sun does not shine, than a iMac.
I rlly like the videos,is a good way to pass time.
Hey Guys, this is an Annoy-o-Tron
Without MacInCloud or a similar service or the use of a VM you'll have trouble uploading an app in to the App Store as it's locked down to only allow uploads from Apple Products (officially that is), that's why. I can think of no other reason.
It exists because apple says we need it
I have the mid 2010 model and it still works perfectly fine for me.
To answer your question, it exists in 2017 because it was released in 2017.
Why do you talk like that, it's weird
My school uses these
Why do Why Does it Exist videos exist in 2017?
They use them in school
Lol 500 dollars for an old dual core with 4GB or ram with no ventilation whatsoever.
Thanks for watching?! What happened to see you in the next one?
quick answer to the question: money
i'm watching this on the same mac mini!!
why does Apple exist in 2017
Little Austin... It's here for the idiots, the apple fanboys, and stupid people. There you go Austin.
Why does it exist in 2017? *next year comes* oh shit guys we gotta destroy all outdated hardware so Autis...Austin doesn't ask!!!
Why does Austin evans'S channel still exist in 2017??? :()
Me when he's a logic fan...
I own the latest edition of the Mac Mini. It's got an i5 3.2 ghz, 1TB HDD, and 16 gigs of RAM. I've had it for a while and it serves all my needs. However I don't use it to work with, I use it so that I can connect a desktop and use my TV as a giant monitor. It's for family use, meaning it's being used to watch movies and TV shows every day, with some occasional gaming. If that's all you're into, then I suggest this machine as long as you're cool with using an old machine. Other than that, just get a laptop
I hope in the future applllleeee consolidates the mac miniiiiiiii and the mac pro into one unit available in weak to super prooooo
vsauce <3
Curiosity box looks legit
omg the way he talks...Mac miniiiiiii  omggggggg I talk like thiiiissss. videooooossss he kinda sounds retarded no shade

What is that

Some would say fewer ports lol
Omg the way he speaks lol 😂 miniiiii

*#9* *TRENDING*
Sub if your from trending
I would get one if it’s specs were upgraded.
A Mac Mini?\nMust be a tiny burger from McDonalds then.
Its a marketing strategy, if they pull the product from the market, investors will say its a failure, so they just ignore it and never update it.
Bro i have a mac mini soo....✌
Why aren't they using  an m2 drive  insdie Laptops?
Hey Austin if you make A dsi Worth it video I'll sub and share this video to my friends
There's this thing called eBay, it's a magical website that you can find used stuff on like shitty macs. Don't spend $500 on a brand new turd, just buy a pre-owned one. Or just don't buy a turd at all.
Y does the fitbit exist in 2017?? There are a lot more smart bands which are more accurate and wayy cheaper
Apple sucks big time, they removed the easy memory upgrade options, and stopped release updated hardware versions. They stopped selling the 16gb versions in some countries. Probably, Apple wants to kill most affordable Mac, they have!!
Why does he sound like a higher pitched version of Troy McLure from the Simpsons. He emphasised that start of all his words and then falls off on the end. Should be doing tele shopping channels or something
Can you people get me to 100 subscribers
I still use Mac mini today. It is slow but I don't play fast games and I only need it to rec ROBLOX which isn't that heavy! I never lag and I always use the 2005 version. This tells us a lot about how good steve jobs was.
I actually really doubt it's for consumers. It's probably largely still made specifically for developers. We use a dozen mac minis as Jenkins boxes at my job.
Guys voice is so annoying...in the box. Thouuuuu,   In the boooooxxx,   Why does he drop his voice at the end of almost every sentence
i want to see austin evans shirtless
I had to get the $699 Mac mini because I could not afford an iMac or MacBook
is he autistic
How did this get onto trending?
Is my comment about Austin Evans worth it?
Cherdleys in real life
funny in url
It's trash
Because apple fanbois are retarded
Austin Is Awesome
Austin looks like logic
*Hello, is this the Krusty Krab?*
Can you link a Mac Mini to a computer screen only? :0
You need to make a tshirt that says cheeky little coffee
JP is sooooo cute.   What a great trip for all 3 of these guys
someone should do a compilation of Louis saying Aiight i got a cheeky little coffee :D
So dope...lovin' these vlogs fam
I question whether 4K is necessary for YouTube vlogs, because the vast majority of viewers do not have 4K graphics. I'm watching in 1080p and the picture quality is excellent.
Wee get ittt - you have a better planee
No mention of the poor guy who fed you coffee and snacks through the nights, thats gratitude for you ;)
This made scotland seem like the north pole
I love this world series, so inspiring, I even started my own channel after seeing this, but I made it my own. I do vlogs about events in London, and all that.
13:02. Just beautiful💚💚💚
Woop woop! My home town of Wick!
I am really enjoying the videos. & the three of you are getting on so well and todays video. WOW that drone filming of the castle in Scotland. Right on the edge of the sea.& all the farmland and livestock. Amazing
Someone should make a video of all of the times Louis said just grabbed a cheeky little coffee
Hi I have best deal for people who loves to travel around the world at the same time to earn some money with it. Email me at parth_upadhyaya@yahoo.com to know further.
I live in Scotland and Wick is my grandparents local airport (they can only really get to Edinburgh from there)
great to see you loving Scotland/Caithness!
Come to Inverness
Love you bro! I want to show you around Sydney Australia !!! Even better, fly into a small coastal airport in NSW called Albion Park and leave the rest to me!! Peace out BOOM!
Im from dublin!
Have JP review theses video's. You guys are in baller heaven.... or is still on a bicycle in Idaho. https://m.youtube.com/user/streetattractionuk
You should have landed on the Faroe Islands - so picturesque there
Am I the only one who thinks after the world tour he should visit every state in the plane, or every European country or Asian country
We all float down here.
CHEEKY LITTLE COFFEE COUNT: 10234091230491234123412346725367682352231
7th on trending bro 😮
Nice video man
2 weeks ago
You're making history. Congrats on arriving back in the UK. All the hours of filming and editing are so appreciated. This is Youtube Gold.
6:19 Guy on the right looks like scout from tf2
Love the beats in this episode!
I'll take some cashews. I like cashews. and then you wip out a banana.  :-)
Sightseeing is just a BIT better in a 210 (high wing, no struts) than a Bonanza, Matt!  (But Bonanzas do fly better :) lol)
I got excited as the arrow in the thumbnail pointed to where I live and I was like WoAh you live in Caithness\n\nAnd then he said england.\n\nLies\n\nOnly lies
Everything about this video is top notch, Great Job!
both planes are awesome in their own ways but if you were in his Bonanza JP and he would be rubbing shoulders anda cpl hundred pounds of useful load would be left home for maybe 3 to 5 knots advantage\n\na Bonanza is lighter on the controls but having owned both types i'll take a Centurion any day in weather and IMC conditions..much more stable
Scotland reminded me of game of thrones scenes
Louis has such a peaceful attitude. Even when they dog on his plane and say little side comments about changing GoPro batteries. If this is the personality of pilots no thanks.
If would love to do this. But you need lots of money to do it.
What part of Scotland is his mum from??
Funforlouis where abouts on Scotland are your mum side from??
will there ever be a place where louis can get just a cup of coffee? wherever he goes the little cheeky one seems to follow
This is by far my favourite set of vlogs on this channel so far. Pure authentic adventurous content. Keep up this kind of stuff up, don't work yourself too hard and thank you infecting the world with positivity
Save yourself the time and drop the 4k..didnt even know it was, seemed like 1080. waste of time if know one notices. the only time it is noticeable and worth doing is for aerials and very scenic land shots. \nget some sleep instead :D
Have you guys got on on each others nerves by now?  How are you coping?
I would be so scared to fly around the world ahhh , I wonder if these smaller planes are safer than big people carrier ones.
What up with Tell me more in the background at the haggis place?
I was excited every upload in watching your series, but u take way to long to upload, I literally forgot about the vlogs
Thanks for the awesome experience of watching your adventure Louis!!
i’ve lived in scotland my entire life (20 years) and never ate haggis i have no idea how matt was able to do it
I want to know whether or not the coffee I'm drinking is a cheeky little coffee or not. I don't know how to tell the difference.
The castle and the overcast sky were giving me Harry Potter vibes. The green in Scotland is so pretty.
OMG THE TREE HOUSE SUPER COOL! =)
Simply put this series is legendary.
Thanks for promoting our beautiful country. You are welcome home anytime.
Nice to see the guys smiling in unison! \nGood vibes!\nShout out to the pilot/s ♡☆♡
Why did you leave Scotland in the first? *draws Tesco discount shank from north face puffer jacket*
I ONLY FOUND OUT IT IS IN 4K NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Louis...you don't come to Scotland enough
Haha, here on my up next video queue there's a video from CBS about Matt's flying around the world.
OMG!!!  That Castle!!!!   Amazing!!!!  Love these videos!!!!
hello all, come and check us out
this is so inspirational - i would love to travel the world some day❤️❤️
Great Vlog bro. Loved that castle.  Don't stress yourself over getting the vlogs online all the time. We're all human and travelling round the world can't be easy - make sure you sleep and get enough rest. We can wait - your health is more important Sir.
Great stuff, love that castle!
Their staying at the Norseman hotel because I go there a lot it is kinda expensive but not to expensive it's called the Norseman Hotel in wick
Is he going to Scotland??
Like if you're from Scotland
Yo i love your vids. Avid follower. Im from London but living in jakarta for a couple of years. Any plans to stop over in indonesia?
loving these vlogs so much! Dont worry that theyre not up to date!! It is not a problem :) :)
come to Fiji when you flying over the Pacific....
Really enjoying these vlogs guys.\n\nI was born in Scotland on the east coast in Stonehaven. Now living in Australia we visited ( for the first time since I left in 1971) two years ago and I had the very same nostalgic feeling every moment I was there.....  when I left it was as sad as it was when I left the first time.
I feel like Louis never includes enough of the flight in these episodes which is half of the adventure id think. does anyone agree?
Fun fact, Matt ended his around the world trip at High Performance Aircraft at Gillespie Field in El Cajon (San Diego), California. I work one hangar away from that and watched him during his press interview when he landed.
Great music for that epic drone shot!
Those aircrafts scare me.
Great Vlog Guy's :)
show less of inside of the cockpit and more of the outside scenery...less facetime...!!\nit'll be much better to see the outside scenery than same people talking everytime..\nanyways loving the trip...!
Dude, why are all your coffees cheeky?
why did the route change from islamabad to mumbai?
What plane are you flying
what are the fuel prices for planes like this ?
Louis you don’t have to loose sleep because of us! I personally will wait. Its better to be healthy and sleep so get your rest and do the editing when you have enough rest.
Louis sleep is important. I hope you guys stay a couple of days in a location soon so you can all rest. Love these videos tho. Great series!
One of the main ingredients in haggis is sheep's lung.  Haggis is banned in the U.S.
Love the 4k, it is worth the rendering time.  It will also help future-proof the documentary.  Keep up the great work!
A great place for a wedding may be????
Damn Louis! Always killin it!  Really love that Logo animation in the beginning!
Louis, I think that was the land welcoming you back home (Scotland).
Oh hey it's the North Korea dude
wow this is very delayed. Alfie made his vid when you arrived 2 weeks ago. You must be in spain or something idk! xd loving the vlogs
i really cant listen to the flight mic when you can hear everyone... louis alone is fine, but jp and the other dude just hurts in my ears.
Enjoying this epic trip.Can't wait for Africa and Asia...
What's happened? You haven't flown in over a week
kurt cobain was playing a show in a town in scotland, and he felt a strange feeling, like a connection to the place, and later, he found out he had relations from that exact town
People often talk about having a sense of physical and psychological wellbeing. However I consider in terms of holistic well-being, what you are feeling Louis is a sense of spiritual and emotional well-being.  I think it's a hard place to get to especially when you are living in a rat race society with so many commitments.  Loving this trip!
Omg I remember watching Louis' vlogs a long time ago like years and got reminded of his channel just now and couldn't remember his name so I searched vlogger with incredible dreadlocks and Vlogger who hurt himself on a skateboard cuz I remembered that video where he fell and hurt himself bad I'm so happy that I found his channel again and I will make sure to subscribe :D
Louis, third wheel much?
Omg my ex is in this video at 12:45 what a coincidence
why didn't you interview @DaveErasmus for your upcoming Aftermovie ? 🤔
Three white males, this triggers me so much. And the way Louis says guys rather than gender neutral people.
I seriously had a very difficult time uploading this. I don't like to put anything in my videos that might bring your mood down so please forgive me. I just need to start opening up a little more for you guys so you can understand some of the things that are taking away from the vlogs. Thank you so much for being here either way. I love you so much. See you Tomorrow. :)
you can do it roman
I watch everything
I am subscribe
Vent away
You and your family Change my life everyday im glad you did this vlog your REAL life its awesome you share
Roman if you need to take a break from the vlogs so you won’t be so stressed and so you can sleep then go ahead. I’m not just a fan, I’m a caring fan and I love you. There will not be anything that you post that I don’t watch. You’re amazing!
Oh my god, why are so many people being dicks for no reason, if you don't like his work, don't watch him, it's that simple.
Love your vlogs and do what you have to do. Smile more 😝😜😛
I love you roman and your doing an amazing job keep it up !! 🙌🏽💯
I watch every video to the end
We still love you!! its life and you do what you have to do!  Love you all
It makes me sad to know ppl get upset that you leave you family. You're doing big things and ppl definitely need to remember that. Me and my boys watch your videos almost every school night just before bed. They look up to you and rightfully so. I admire your dedication to your family and respect your Drive. You need to do what you are happy with. If it's your project put whatever the fluff you want in it lol. As for the vlogs we would all miss you if you took a break but if that'll help just know your supporters will be here whenever you'd return. Your doing wonderful things for so many ppl so just remember that. Your human and sometimes you just have to step back and asses things, figure things out. Chat with Brit & the boys about how to make it better and easier on all of you. At the end of the day you'll always have fans that support you and your family is always there. So just take a minute to think about what's the best option right now and go from there. Sending lots of love from our family straight to yours. Xoxo \nCheers
OMG I did not see this vid straight away and I missed my opportunity to see Roman Atwood!! WHYYYY!!! 😢😢🔫🔫

Im in the UK I wanna snuggle your mate on the rocking horse Roman ;)
I've been watching literally EVERY SINGLE SECOND OF EVERY VLOG since before Roman had 1 mil subs
You know what Roman? You need some time off, no needed to be sorry, if anyone expects you to record every aspect of you and your families lives, they need a serious reality check, take as much time as you need man, you can only do so much, you and your family are leaving behind a lot of memories for YouTube to share, so even you stopped youtubing, I believe this channel still would grow, only the real peeps would stick around even if you quit, all I can say is, you and your family keep your heads up and smile more, many blessings sent my friend.
We understand.. PLEASE PLEASE PLEEAASSSEE do not apologize for being a human being and having real life problems ❤️
Roman I will always support you no matter what
Stop stressing ur going to be ok stop handing over projects to the man
We are here for you man
At least you are doing some vlogs as opposed to not doing any like the dudesons.  They have just dropped off the planet to get their project going. Keep going and Smile More!!!
Roman u have it rough take a break from vlogging until u finish the project. True Roman Soldiers would approve
its okay roman i wont leave no matter how loong you take a break whether it 2 days or 2 months.
It breaks my heart to see some of the comments you have to read daily! You are doing an amazing thing with your project the channel can wait till it's finished! You put your heart into all that you do and your probably exhausted and stretched super thin! Focus on your family and the project and us true Roman  soldiers will be waiting! I love your videos and they are a part of my daily routine but I would hate to know I'm sitting here enjoying a video that is causing you stress and pain! Take care of yourself! I'll be praying things level out and get in balance for you Roman! God bless you and SMILE MORE!

Game Atwood would be a great name for a gaming channel.
Roman, you're doing a great job. You're trying and that's all we can ask. Keep it up! -long time follower Kayla..
Roman honestly man do what you gotta do man, as fans we'll understand. Balancing the vlogs and a project like this is not easy and it sucks to see you like this man. But hopefully you'll pull thru man best of luck ^

Why is this guy famous
Love you Roman no matter what how your energy is like we all love you xx
Doesn't help the fact that he's carrying the weight of three people
Literally the most shocking display of physical prowess I've ever witnessed, and likely the only time Richard Ayoade was the coolest man in the room lol
So agile it's astounding!
funny clip, but the revival of this show is an absolute joke.
Not exactly built for physical activities the tubby little virgins lol so funny and fell arse over head in the aztec zone just walking up a step lol gravity is a bitch!
I laughed when I first saw this and I'm laughing again now 😂
heavy panting on the first planet? this was never going to end well.....but comedy gold
Oh god please don't use interlaced video.
Me and the wife watched it and cried.
Aw these are the loser squad the cosplayers
This chubby fellow will forever be haunted by this experience. He shall pass the local chippie and go straight to the gym.
I knew this would trend when I watched it on tv. Poor lad, but it's just physics in action, his own weight moved the thing he was standing on out of reach of everything he tried to step towards. Not a good game for people who like a pie or three, I fear!
And that children is the reason why you exercise.
I pissed myself when he was on, didnt laugh justed pissed myself.
Omfg he is actually absolutely fucking useless piece of shite
an A+ athlete, a true inspiration.
Let us not forget that when they were running into the next zone, the same contestant you see here fell face-first into the ground.
Why is he out of breath?
Fact: they really do lock them into the rooms on the crystal maze and since being shut into the planet room Rob has had to become a pole dancer and put his new found skills to good use in order to generate some income for himself.
Hes a dragon right so why doesn't he just fly over?
As soon as there was hint from the team that he should turn back, he was like - 'fuck this I'm heading back' 😂
Check the nick of that fat desperate cunt
Change speed to 1.5 and you may just cack your pants.
This is why aliens refuse to visit us.
Gotta go down as tv gold.couldnt stop laughing the other day when we watched it.
In a way I don't really expect much from someone who dresses up as a furry!! x'D And he was doing some weird pedo panting in there too on those planets.
One of the worst things I've ever watched! 😂😂😂😂 poor fella
Ground control to major Tom?
I was wacthing this last night and laughed so much I woke my family up
Next time... On interdimensional cable 4!
HAHAHAHHAHAA!!!   Poor ol' Rob.   Funny as fuck tho'
Some say this is lost NASA footage
That would've annoyed me being his team mate..I'm frustrated easily and his heavy breathing and failure at something so simple would've infuriated me..I'm a bad team player when it comes to having weak people in my team.
I know this man, he works in the same place as me. aww bless him.
the team were fun but...and i'm sorry if you reading this team..they were not the best physically built for the job...not very athletic for the physical challenges..the best Member being Martin IMO\n\nthey were there to have fun though i'll give them that and the beard dilemma was daft yet noticeable...if they ended with 5 seconds they could have been the new  team of..rubbish but loveable\n\nstarted strong and then...ohhhhhhh dear
I was laughing like fuck when i saw this on Friday
Just watched it again, and it's still hilarious, just noticed his laboured breathing throughout the ordeal, the ludicrous advice from his team ( do the thing) and the girl snorting with laughter towards the end. Pure class. Afterwards he was trying surreptitiously to get his gloves off and couldn't even manage that !! Please put the whole thing up !!
I keep thinking this is nick crompton
I feel like he was this bad on purpose, to leave a legacy on the show he likes so much.
This moment is going to be on best tv moments next year. This episode was hysterical
When did this show start again and Richard as the host brilliant.
That fat fuck s a retard... he doesn't know how to control his own damn body
This is what happens when you don't keep fit.
10 seconds in and it sounds like he ran a marathon. Wrong guy for the job
Wheres the mad bald gay bloke in the tiger jacket?
Don't make me shave your captain  ~ the human race 2017
My parents said it would go viral\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were right
That's what happens when *real panic* sets in - you end up going round in circles!!!\nLucky the game wasn't a 'timeless' one.  Rob would still be spinning...
I am REALLY Hoping this Episode & this Moment is Highlighted on This Week's Gogglebox...
I feel sorry for the guy because there is no way he's running away from this
Thank you Rob for the laugh, you really are a donut going round and round
It was even funnier when they only had 5 seconds in the dome, quality content from the team. :)
This is the pinnacle of British TV
Watched this live too. Funniest thing on TV in AGES!!
Should if got the bit when he fell up the step😂😂
What a waste of air
That was Rob's first of this swing planets model outer space of the solar system of not getting a crystal & first to be ALIS automatic locked in!
I watched this on tv today lol 😎😜🙂
PLEASE SHOW THE PART WHERE HE TRIPPED OVER IN AZTEC ZONE, I NEARLY DIED.
poor person for the job looking at him his twin got locked in too! Lol.
Who on earth gave this fat fuck a Physical game?? And how the fuck did he pass the medical for this gameshow?? His breathing sounds like he needs a fuckin' ventilator because the fat is pushing in his lung capacity.
Christ this was painful to watch. That guy was so shit he shouldn't have been let on the show.
Right finally everyone I have persuaded Robert to get onto Twitter as hes becoming such a hit, follow or message him on Twitter: Planet_Spinner
Bend your knees and get a good swing ffs. This was hilarious though 😂
ROB!
gg samwell tarly
SPAZ BOY!
Reminds me of James corden
What a knob
So So Funny 😂😂😂😂😂
Truly iconic
Richard Ayoade is funny.
a fine specimen
Useless fatty 😂
Top 10 anime feats
So good
Boi is that samwell​ tarly
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Hahahahahahahahahaha
Fat mess sort ya self out
My destiny raid members.
LOL hahaha  2:20 bloody brilliant!
Well done Rob
Lmfao !ROBBBBB
what a clown
Spearmint Rhino has changed
Me during PE
Humiliation and cringe
Genuinely haven't laughed so much at a tv program. Not only this jem but the fall in Aztec zone... amazing. Best episode of CM ever!
When that other guy tripped on the fuckin stairs as well, priceless team
Well what do you expect from a cavalcade of fucking furries.
Hi, Matt here from UNILAD. We love your video and would love to share it with our tech audience. Please contact me for more information matt.weston@unilad.co.uk
Four of the contestants are in desperate need of a gastric band.
This team looked absolutely on fire to begin with, like they'd actually studied the show and were going to boss every single challenge, but it went downhill pretty quick. I mean they were entertaining enough, but not quite as clever as they thought they were unfortunately.
Can he swing it towards the green one?. He's struggling with the orange one right next to him mate.
Did someone say autism.... On a side note, every single one of them wanks at least twice a week over that 'bird'.. FACT
Cucktestant's are feeble :)
Why did they pick the fat guy 🤣
Hahahahahahha cunt glad u didn't win hahahahahaha fat cunt lose weight
What a useless human being , i hope his friends disown him after that.
Who would you cast as adult versions of the Losers' Club in the inevitable It sequel? We're going to have to go with Amy Adams as Beverly.
fuck that, i'd rather watch the original.
Tozier not Tojer.
Me: Nicholas Hamilton! Cool name...\n\nMe: Wait- ALEXANDER HAMILTON
Bill (It) did perfect! The smile is perfectly nerve-racking. I just saw the movie and was terrified. I'm still fucking shaking, I haven't been scared of a horror movie since Silent Hill. Of course most horror movies have good plots, but are never perceived well and are less fearsome.
In the book Pennywise has an electric blue tie. How could you mess that up?
I was hoping for the half eaten bodies wrapped up in spider web more than anything else in this movie...ah well. Too much CGI for the scary parts, but the cast was fantastic.
this video rocks!! love all this IT stuff. I finished the book just two weeks ago and I can't let go, I'm obsessed!
I much prefer that Pennywise look like an actual circus performer  clown instead of a birthday hobo clown.
lol I go to school with jack grazer
I cant wait till this movie comes out on dvd, gonna poop my pants when it comes out
I saw the movie and the fact that it was way scarier then 1990...remember pennywise only comes out every 27 years,and the first time it was 1990,27 years later was 2017 lets wait 27 years for the next it...
Masters of Sex?
Who else just skipped to pennywise?
I want nothing to do with King or anything he is involved in.
I hate this clown appearance I would like to see the orginal makeup
I would like to see IT face of against a kid with actual psychopathy. A child with no empathic functions or the ability to sense fear (as we know it). \n\nWould IT just kill him and be done with it or try to use him? Perhaps IT would see it as interesting as well.
The casting was perfect
I hate colons
In my opinion these kids nailed this movie🙌🏾
. \n\n\n\n\n\nIt's in my second fanny pack
The clown was too good looking because it's Bill
I LOVED the new IT movie!!
This is not the type of clown you would like to see at the carnival anytime soon. I died laughing at that, intentional or not it was funny. (In the book, at the carnival some bullies get angry at a gay couple, which leads to them throwing one of them over the bridge, in which IT takes him and drags him under.)
they did good but the guy with the stutter is way taller than the rest of them and it looked like he was two-three years older than them.
🎈🎈🎈🎈\n   🎈🎈🎈\n      🎈🎈\n          🎈\n           🤡
Stan Uris was totally worthless in the movie
*OOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG, can't people every be happy with what they got/get?*
Of the Loser's Club members, you listed the Black kid and the Jewish kid last...was that intentional or merely unconscious?
Why would a good looking girl be apart of a group called the loser club
a GAY clown would feed itself quite well in every smaller US TOWN I guess
A bully in marvels ant man ?
The pinned comment at the top is proof of the validity of this video and this channel....that would be none.
No
I think they all look ok
The cast looks just fine to me. I loved the adaptation and so did Stephen King. So changing or wishing changes is pointless.
Did you guys remember the train scene man that was good shit....
Who's seen this ???
it's book accurate...stop comparing it to the mini series.
The movie was a pile of shite
Looper stop click baiting, for fuck's sake.
Already watched twice at the 🎥 anyone else watch more than once
dc by Eagles played out late now\n\nPla
I was expecting for drawings
Sophia is somehow 5'0, she looked taller but ig that's editing for you
Patrick looks like Rodrick
i love clowns, I love grapes
Dane Dehaan as older Bill
This I by far my favorite movie if you haven't seen it yet go watch it NOW!!!!!🤡
Next video idea: *How IT should really be spelt*
me encanto
red bull clownathon@
Know
Title has me like Caste of what exactly'?
Jack Douglass\nShould be Pennywise
Skårsgard needed hella lot more lines
*Beverly was THICC*
Buyer hunter violence kcmsmm need crop office musical.
I saw the movie today... and i cant sleep from watching it... so i go to youtube and scroll through trending...my heart skipped a beat.
YOU KNOW WHAT THESE ARE MOM!? THEY'RE GAZEBOS!!!!
I Like The Bill Skarsgard Pennywise The Best Also There's Awesome Music While There's A Horror Movie Going On
I get the point of the vid, but the acting is 100x more important than how they look.
R
I'm gau
Can I just say\n\nGOD I LOVE THE ENTIRE CAST SO MUCH
It was a really really good movie
THE MANSION IS FROM AMERICAN HORROR STORY😮😮😮
GUYS PLEASE SUB TO ME IF I HIT 1000 SUBS MY FRIEND WILL GIVE ME 100 DOLLARS CASH PLEASEEE
I was disappointed . They did not carry over the spirit of the book
Pennywise teeth remind you of the teeth from the things in dreamcatchers
fans of IT won't soon forget her name.\n\nYou're making the assumption that I remember any actor's name. There are very few I can think of off the top of my head. Maybe a half dozen, and that's from memes. Don't have much memory for people of little importance.
The characters just have new ITerations
I see Chris Pratt playing Ben
Why is Pennywise's nose so huge in the thumbnail?
The only thing is... the creature IT, uses the form of Pennywise to better catch his prey, children. He's supposed to be a family friendly looking clown, kind of like Tim Curry's portrayal of him, but Skarsgard's portrayal seems alot more like he would frighten kids away :L
Nfk
Am I the only one that wants no name actors for the adult versions of the characters? The movie star presence would really take me out of the movie
fin made that movie
Pleas I wish to get 1000 subscribe pleas help me \nPleas
Scuffed j's
Who else wished IT wasn't in chapters?
This movie was ass
Personally, I thought that Tim Curry's Pennywise was scarier because it was more realistic, and that's scarier (to me, at least). I wasn't scared of this one since it was obviously CGI'd.
still ship the new kid and bev
Wow I literally got an It ad 😂😂😂😂
Lol is it just me or does mike hanlin look like mohamed ali
Watch IT again look at the front of bills hair its red its a firey red in his fringe!
This is quite possibly the most unnecessary video ever made.
Stan Uris in the book does not have a sense of shaken faith. It is the opposite. His faith combined with parenting of his parents prevents him from fully accepting that something absurd and crazy like a powerful creature Pennywise exists at all. The book says that his faith and culture always pull him to worldview that everything makes sense, has cause and effect, and some kind of order.
Amazing acting.
For the grown cast they should be: Jessica Chastain as Beverly \nRyan Reynolds as Ritchie \nPatrick Wilson as Ben\nJames Mardsen or Paul Rudd as Bill\nJosh Lucas as Stanley \nAdrian broody as Eddie \nBoris Kudjoe as Mike
Nope...Pennywise in the original was the scariest character EVER! I'll watch this because Stephen King is THE MAN, but i'm not expeccting better than the original.
Repent from sin, Jesus is Lord, crucified, buried, and risen from the dead, died for sinners, turn to Him
Who else thought the guy that played pennywise cute
Who else got an IT Ad
Pennywise-Jackfilms
Jack is a smol bean
Y un comentario en español :v
This movie was great. The best remake i have ever seen. Blows the original away.

#LBWSQUAD 😝
IIIVANNN PERISIC !! ⚫💙
🔵⚫
Terza giornata!??? 😂😂
#ForzaInter
Forza inter
Ci stava il pareggio , l'Inter non meritava di vincere , il Crotone ha fatto una grande partita e secondo me ci salveremo 🔴🔵🔴🔵🦈🦈
Nice Hat-trick! Handanovic
Worst game all season, including pre-season, still winning tho..
The home side fought very well
Brasile vs Sfinter... che culo immondo 😂
forza AZZURRI
A shaky win
LIGA SERIE A TIM,presenta nola seriea tim
Ecco guardate bene questa prestazione che una partita così il Crotone non la fa più
Il Crotone ha solo un buon portiere. L'Inter ha forse il migliore portiere del mondo (è tra i pochissimi in lizza per esserlo). Forse a portieri invertiti il risultato sarebbe stato diverso.
Ma che partita ha fatto Crotone? Non merita la sua posizione nella classifica, ne del Benevento
That line-up might be full of talent, but the midfield is way too offensive, it looks like a team Zeman might field. They'd get relegated immediately, especially in considering how tactical Serie A is, but they'd be a lot of fun to watch.\nAlso, can Kjear and Glik play in a three-man defence? RCB and LCB are not the same as a regular CB.
Inter caralho
Solito ci lo inter
Ci stava un botto il pareggio 2-2/ 1-1
Solita inter ladrona
Solita Inter fortunata
Dat way
Album dropping real soon for the past 4 months
wow a good migos interview
montreality been killing it with the interviews... killy interview coming soon ?!
MAMA
Montreality Way
yah montreality yah datway yah canadian way yah
I ain't left off Bad and Boujee
False acusisations
I can't wait for astroworld, culture2 and quavo+travis scott album
I wonder how they chemistry like when they jus chillin
Who the purple one?\nLeonardo. LOL
Takeoff constantly on lean, or he disabled somewhat.
Come on frankenstein looking ass nigga
Quavo never had a job. But he damn sure always giving people hard times on theirs. Smh he act super Hollywood now. You're tough son.
False accusisations -Takeoff
Joe Buddens really turned these niggas around and made them talk more and give better interviews lmaoooooo
“not universal” yeah you knew quick
One day this comment will find itself lost in the comment section
2:27 wtf was takeoff doing
Takeoff my favorite Migo 🔥
LMAOOOOOO QUAVO ALREADY STARTED OFF LIT 😭😭😭😭
Low key the best Migos interview
Reading is lit, though. Gotta read.
How is this channel so underrated
I love their music but their interviews are shit even the one with nardwar. The perky cough sirop lifestyle hits you hard in brain cells. Offset definitely my favourite of the migos, sick verses and chill looking guy.
The heart shaped glasses are the only ones TakeOff rocks now
Do I look like i'm left off Bad & Boujee?
Takeoff kinda sounds different on here or maybe it's just me
travy and quavo needa stop playing and drop the album already
At the age of 86 imma have 86 chicks🤣
i'm sorry, someone is biting their style? have they ever seen how andre 3000 dress, prince? man gtfoh.\nthey sound like tpain when he said he started auto tune....NIGGA PLEASE, ROGER TROUTMAN started auto tunes. they're out of touch with reality.
If you like discovering new artist check my page @ www.soundcloud.com/canarycolors
Why tf does takeoff have heart shape frame.... type sweet shit he on?... Still the homie I guess...
Bitch I'm a dog , Give my treat
I respect Migos mad heavy! Thank you Montreality for the good question
Quavo can't roast saying um every other word😭😭
I’ve been listening to Migos since bando, after that everything they put out became 🔥
how tf u aint watch dbz and u in your mid to late 20s
I see lots of ice in this interview yet I got no Jewels or Gems from it..
Might it occur to yourself I mustn't be forgotten from bæd and bóugé
This channel is slept on
Quavo is actually a clever guy
Keep a tight circle and set multiple goals, goddam those are some wise words 👆🙏
we must protect the migos at all cost
Migos > Beatles
Nigga what did you say Lmaoo 2:08 false acussisation 
Glaciality, naw I'm sayin? Iceality, Montreality. All types of shit ❄️⌚💸💣
Frankenstein lookin ass nigga
DBZ be that shit tho, offset hipp 💯
Quavo sound geeked
Yea I never smoke no dope . DOPE WAY .
Culture 2

MONTREAL WAY
REALLY HEART SHAPED GLASSES 😂😂😂😂 GANGSTAS NOW A DAYS BOY SMH
They all sound like the same faggy swag rappers out there I don't know what they're talking about. And only hard core pop artists sound like them.
take them glasses dat way lol
Offset the lit one\nQuavo the chilled one\nTakeoff the lowkey one
3:13 Quavo just described himself
They actually talked wow
offset the only good rapper in group. quavo just a hook man. takeoff irrelevant
Great interview
Takeoff you were my guy but damn...
We changed hip hop errrrm no dickhead, you ruined it fuckin autotune faggots
Migos stole rich the kidd whole style>> The biting way u aint staRT shit >>>
*doitlooklikeimleftoffbadandboujee?*
Abort takeoff, i repeat abort takeoff.
Takeoff fav glasses he wears 247 never take em off.
Look at these 3 dickheads
Rappers now a day act like dumb blondes lmfao still a lit ass video and lit ass channel 🙆🏻
He beat him like he stole something.
...Tapped to strikes tho??
go get bisping
Actually,I'm glad cuz he talked even more trash then Rockhold! And he's the one that said I'ma beat you like you stole something.' He ate those words.
TAP TAP TAP
Rock hold is the best middle weight ever
At least cm punk didn't tap out due to strikes \nBranch cannot be called a black belt!!!!
1 minute with a guy like cockhold at your back. brain damage or tap?
Insecure black men on suicide watch! XD
This was a horrible match-up. No way did Branch belong in there with a guy ranked as highly as Rockhold. Period. We're getting a second helping of this farce when OSP does the same thing to Okami.
that was a nasty body triangle
Luke outcold
Imma beat you like you stole something.
Figures. First card I miss in a while, because of Canelo vs. GGG and the card turns out to be stacked with a bunch of KOs and Subs instead of decisions.
You see how he checked out his work as he walks away. this is hilarious.
Ground n pound from the wesssssssstside
David Ill keep this fight on the feet if I want Branch
Rockhold is really good looking, perfect physicque  tbh. Ripped and aesthetic but also with functional muscle that works in fights
Luke roidshold
Can't wait until he gets revenge against Bisping.
he will never be champ again.
Tapping out to strikes... Bob Sapp looks like he lost a lot of weight...
Great fight, but please stop telling me that Branch has earned a black belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu under Renzo Gracie. Please stop! Maybe Ebay, Etsy, Target...I don't know. Surely he hasn't 'earned' one.
IMO It's between him and Anderson Silva over who's the best MiddleWeight. That'd be a good fight too btw.
David branch is one of those lying cousins...he lied to his aunt to this day about getting her UFC tickets ....hes just a scumbag who says he's going to be something when everyone knows he's not ...
Listen mothafucka!!!
GG
Bisbing would have ko rockhold again
way too similar to the recent weidman comeback. fixed like boxing.
wth???? ive never seen a guy tap out like that. intresting
Rockhold slowly going bald ,   how's he going handle that ,   i mean ARCHER is going bald
Better hope the ref doesn't stop it\n*30 seconds later*\nBranch: tap tap tap\n\nClearly he WAS hoping the ref would stop it
JESUS is  real!!!!!! Did u know that? Look it up... The time is now
Geez, what do u even call that? Tko by tapout?
The move of the fight was, let me gently lay you down right here.
Branch was piecing Rockhold with strikes, he just didn't have KO power.
awesome Luke you beat a no name in a fight night  Main event...your back?! ? !? hahah
Henry hooft had a good night last night. His whole team came out winning with KO's, except for Luke, but that was basically a KO
essa cara não tem fôlego pra 5luta
always bet on black lol
Sporchmensip HAHAHAH
Branch pulled a GSP
When Rockhold gets top control it means big trouble. The athleticism keeps him there.
He tapped out with strikes wow talk to all that s***
Good job rock you beat him like he stole something lol
Bj Penn
Luke The Dbbag Cockhold!
Luke cuckhold is losing his hair yikes
Branch is a goon
Boring commentary
Luke Just beat Thales leites
Nothing wrong with tapping from strikes against Rockhold. Branch was probably thinking about what happened to Weidman when he got pounded on for a minute straight.
This was a boring fight ... Anything else???
He does not have a heart to stay in the ufc
Really hope all these comments aren't serious. Luke needs to beat Bisping and also give Weidman his rematch. Robert is also next in line, there's a lot for Luke to do to be called Best MW.
All the trash talking and now this? Tap from an arm bar or maybe a choke..but this? Lots of other champions got beat up a lot worst, a lot worst and didn't tap
Kinda disappointing to see him tap to strikes, I thought this was the guy to at least to fight go until the end to try to make a statement. Also feel like Luke's hairline is still much better than it might seem, I'm sure it would just look a lot better if he grew his hair a little.
Cormier needs to go ahead & retire so we can see what Luke can do at 205 since the weight cut is killing him now.
Rock hold won, but still had an awful performance.
Rockhold looked a little sluggish to me when the fight started but i guess he had no choice since branch was chasing him down like a hungry dog. I thought branch had him when he let off that flurry of punches in round one but rockhold ate the shots and stayed in the game. Can't believe branch tapped from strikes. Never thought that'd happen. I had rockhold knocking this dude out
I want Uriah hall to destroy Luke that's a fight that I wanna see
I ate unicorn meat. - Jon No Steroids Jones
this was a gimme for luke
Wow Rockhold! What happened to your hair??...
Since the cornermen wouldn't throw in the towel.
Khabib and what he taught you!
David on Wednesday- imma do dis kid dirty\n\nDavid on Saturday- ........
Rockhold cruzou as pernas, foi um erro mas que passou despercebido pelo oponente
Lol, this is more humiliating than getting KO'd stiff.
He was finished, exhausted, no point in taking damage to look tough only then to get a busted ear drum or broken bones
What really is disappointing is branch was pretty vocal about this fight and it went this way. It makes branch look totally foolish now especially since he tapped to strikes. But branch lit up luke with a combo that landed clean and luke took it like a champ so either his chin aint so bad or bisping hits harder than we thought
Gonna go back to Brooklyn like a bitcheckc
needs more volume, thanks.
What a beast!
Even Weidman didn't tap from strikes
Steroids
brownsville style tap
Cruz.  Great sportsman sip 
Ref shoulda stopped this
Luke I'm going bald Rockhold
To much to handle
Bisping stared him down too lol
Ref didnt save him he tapped brah
Shogun rua \nTap too !
Anybody notice Rockhold's new stance?
ima bet you like you stole something
this guy needs to fight yoel ramero
im gonna break u son
Artem Lobov is the GOAT
white genetics
Branch told rockhold in the weigh in his gonna break him. Demented mofcker lol!!
Tapping from strikes, you just don't do it at this level, ever.... Forever know as the Branch (tapping from strikes) don't pull a Branch, ever lol
Luke has a lot of potential but needs a better camp.
So does this count as a submission win for rockhold?
Luke luta veia da pouxa
God I hate that cocky, arrogant fuckhead.  Hope he goes against romero or another 185 killer and gets ktfo again
Either Rockhold is back or Branch is one lousy fighter.
Rockhold has the best body among MMA athletes
After watching Mayweather/GGG/Canelo, mma striking looks so rudimentary
Luke Rockhold wrestling looked like Khabib style !
...if Adalaide Byrd was there, she'd have given the fight to AJ Carter somehow...
Fuck me, he went down quicker than Khan's missus on AJ.
I understand they want to build up boxers confidence against weak opposition but why the fuck are they putting fights against factory workers and cab drivers on fucking telly
dubois needs to step up in opposition for his opponents sake.
Bad call from the ref. Should have called it at the 2nd knock down
118-110 in favour of Carter
BEAST !
Ref was a scumbag for allowing it to continue after the second KD. He was on jelly legs. \n\nMismatches like this and incompetent refs like this will eventually result in an over matched opponent being killed with one shot in the ring.
Wow what a talent..needs to be looked after..
Second knock down he was clearly unfit to carry on bad call ref
This was my first ever boxing match, sat close to the ring, wasn't expecting to see someone pulverised within 60 seconds
This is the new Mike Tyson trust me
Shouldn't of been in there
why put him in the ring against such weak opponents... mike tyson was world heavyweight champion at his age.... they will never get a shot with bullshit promotors like frank warren
I love this kid! Defo would lead in the boxing ting! Only 19 or turned 20 ! Hella young
id get KO'd for a pay day too carter its all good
giving a fuck about the person lying k.o'ed on the floor potentially seriously injured just means you're not a psychopath and not much else, just saying
This man here takeing alot people out aj Joshua will get it promise ye
Ref shoulda stopped it after the second knockdown - something horrible about refs letting fighters get knocked unconscious unnecessarily...
DB needs to be fighting in the mortal kombat tournament with liu kang and sub zero not fighting in a boxing ring
Has some solid power but as always, knocking down weaker opposition doesnt really give me an idea of how he is going to be. Against menudo he was rocked in the first round, so I want to see him take some shots against live opposition before making a call. I wish him all the best though, seems like a nice lad and still got tonnes of time to develop.
is the Referee not fired yet?
Beast! Will be champ one day for sure.
Uk boxers are on a lead
No disrespect to carter but I have seen a few of his fights and he's an awful fighter, DD is to stiff, going no were
Didn't realise that guy is British.
DD is gonna dominate in the future!! 👊🏻👏👏👏
Good lad. He looked genuinely worried about his opponent after the KO
Dubois got real heavy hands.
Chin meet TRUCK!!!!
Uk's Sonny Liston 🤔
definitely a future champ
Steroids
This boy could genuinely give AJ some problems in a couple of years time! 🙂👍
happy bday aj
Well done for trending!
Newcomer.
Dangerous fight
Let me guess, stepping up the hype against nobody's, if he's that good put him in with someone worthwhile.
Rumour has it that Dubious banged out Joshua in sparring
Hearn won't be letting this guy anywhere near Joshua's dodgy chin.
Lol.. stepped into the ring.. looked at the opponent.. didn't understand what happened next.. went to bed... Zzzzzzz..( the movie was so boring that I opted to sleep instead)
he will destroy joshua.. :)
You do not belong in the U.K any longer
How the fuck are you guys on trending XD
This is trending in the United Kingdom, I am so fucking proud right now
Is there an archive of all MMs stuff somewhere?
Oh my God Murdoch Murdoch, absolutely incredible video.\nYou are absolutely correct, our race can't afford to fight each other. Our numbers our too few already.\n\nGod, I love this shit so much lol. Buying every item in the description. Get on Hatreon so I can throw more shekels at you!!\n\nPS: 29k views in 2 days? The fire rises!
Imagine if the South had won. We would have a nice barrier protecting us from Mexiscum (except for the far west).
I know this is going to be heresy to some people, but I'm a little disappointed with this vid def not their best imo. I'll be interested to see the next one and see if they get back to the regular program. I can see if they were trying gun to make a particular point with this video no more brother wars but it still felt a bit cucky.
As if soulless antifa would ever have an epiphany and heil our people and cherish our history. The ending of this video is kinda cucked actually. RIP America. Over half our nation, and the large majority of the world, are mindless zombies. It is all over   :(  \n    Jesus, I know we do not deserve it, but you can return anytime now.
All 2000 of you go to  Labour NZ and  National NZ to drop red pills during election
Uncensored full DVD (or USB which may be cheaper) release when? I'd buy one for $30-50
why the hell did you include Neil Armstrong?! the guy was in on the scam - they never went to the moon!!
I cry every time.
holy shit!  Another amazing and relevant video. Complete with teary-eyed feelz
What recording of the star spangled banner is this? It sounds fantastic
It's an honor to die with you brothers.
this was great and that ending, so much feels
i wasn't ready for that wholesome ending i want my black pills back
A beautiful message of unity. Never stop what you do. I will continue to buy your t-shirts.
great to see you guys are back
I understood about 1% of this. Also, why no native american ghosts.
Yay only for more weeks until a new video
10:20 I'm in love now.
We Russians are with the real Americans.  Fuck the communists they tried to kike us out of existence too.  Almost succeeded but we are coming back.  We will join you vs antifa and the hoards of Islam and shit hole invaders
Sounds like a black man singing
A great fantasy. Too bad t_d and antifa are never going to be our allies. Even if we win them over, they will just be fairweather allies who will cross us as soon as someone else sings them a song.
when my brothers finally wake up
No more Brother wars... Germans... Russians
Didn't expect to get hit by those patriotic feels
Holy shit the rumors are true I fired up a vpn based off in Great  Britain and its #37 on trending well done everyone and Murdoch Murdoch Team
just realized this is the 1st Murdoch Murdoch I can share everywhere without fear of being banned
Dead Man's Hill is in Michigan\nPicallili Park is in England\nHarvey and Irma struck the Southern US\nWhere does this take place Murdoch?
You should make your merch available longer~\nBut I shall attempt to attain shekels quickly anyways. lol
This was just fucking beautiful
I couldnt contain my American feels and clapped at the end.
Never stop this. I don't believe in Yahweh but this is gospel. Also the Super Friendship Team poster is the first thing I've ever bought from a YouTuber so feel special you fucking weebs. ALSO make a discord or something.
I agree no more brother wars unfortunately we here in the south will never understand how these whites from the north and California are even raised to believe the way some of them do. We could have had a paradise in the south if Lincoln would have not been so obsessed with sacrifice of whites for coloreds. That victory alone would have changed world history for the better if the confederate states had been in place to come to the aid of germany during ww2. So glad to see you still making the best videos on jewTube by far. Stay safe out there.#HDNW
Finally. I've been having withdrawals
You guys should make some more T-Shirts, gotta give the Dr. his T-Shirt money. 👌🏻
I think I heard Do you really want to hurt me By Culture Club in there.
Why is this trending in Great Brittan?
Can somebody link this version of the anthem.... its really awesome!
Happy to say that people knitted Confederate uniforms during the war.

Brilliant (again!) ... come on America, we goy in Europe are with you.
Is it just me or has the audio quality gone way downhill?
Lmao this is trending in the UK
My mother caught me watching this and was creeped out and screamed at me like she does every day for everything.
OMG you're a fucking genius! LOVE THE POWER RANGERS REFERENCE XD
I'm all for good optics, but you can do them without civic nationalism. This smacks of it a little too much for my liking. I'm a huge fan of you guys, but this is my least favorite of your offerings. I also realize you have to tone it down to not be getting constantly shoahed, but this is a little cucky for me. As if the antifa (((whites))) would ever come around. As if. Remember, they hate whites, and that will never change. These are people who, when raped by niggers, lie and say whites did it.

Everybody wants to hate Lincoln but for the wrong reason. You people seem to hate him because you've been told so long to like him. The fact of the matter is that what is said about him isn't actually the truth about him. If Lincoln were never shot by that kike John Wilkes Booth, we wouldn't even have to deal with African's in the Us. Due to the historical impact of Lincoln's decision to deport Africans and the removal of American Indians we probably wouldn't even have to worry about Hispanics.
had me actually crying by the end. wow...
WHy the FucK is ThiS tREndiNg ?
>When you love blacks so much that you import millions of them to pick cotton thus denying your Rural population jobs and causing the South to become an agricultural shithole dominated by a plantation elite. \n>Then when the North tells you to stop spreading niggers into other states you flip out and start a massive civil war, and just when it was finally over you kill the one man powerful enough to ship them back to Africa, thus ensuring that Based Niggers in MAGA hats stay as a permanent population.\n>150 years later, your descendants are still so butthurt they autistically shriek about how the Confederacy was a white paradise with a 30% black population.
It's fucking 33 on trending.
I have a few friends who still don't buy Bruce's legendary status. This clip and the one of The Stones a few years back inviting him up for Tumbling Dice oughta silence them. The Stones, Sir Mick and Sir Paul don't just ask anybody on to their stage. Bruce has earned his way there. Brooooooooce.\nOh btw, love me some Paul. Still rocking and killing it and looking like a happy kid doing it!! The best.
Hey by the way I love this video so much and I love paul mccartney! ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤
Paul always -- ALWAYS -- sings significantly better when he has a friendly foe sharing the mic with him.
Seeing paul loving playing just as he did when he was young got me kinda choking up :')
Good to see Silvio Dante made it through the war with Brooklyn alright.
Was an awesome show! So glad I was able to witness it in person! Paul, Bruce and Little Steven greatness!
I just got home from the Barclays concert tonight, I loved it so much I'm gonna go see him when he goes to Nassau, it was an unbelievable concert that I will never forget. I hope everyone who has seen him so far and is going to had or will have the best time of there lives like I did. God bless Sir Paul McCartney
Im so jealous! i wish I will have the chance to see them together singing that song!!
Hopefully more jams between Bruce and Paul as the tour progresses!
I saw her standing and texting on her phone there
Along with Dylan, Young and Johnny Cash my all time hero. Long live The Boss
Paul McCartney now 75. Hope I can still be around at that age. What an amazing guy.
Holy shit. I would've lost my fucking mind if I was there.
The joy in Bruce's face to be back with a Beatle. Wonderful!
The boss rocking a les paul like his ol' teenage self! Suits him well!
ATTENTION!!!ATTENTION!!!ATTENTION!!!{BREAKING NEWS}\nHello guys, checkout some very very interesting information about Bruce Springsteen that everybody MUST know here http://bit.ly/2yg6zEZ
Jim I need a copy of this show
Best concert of my life! Thanks for posting!!!
I was there. Great videos Jim. Thank you.
I was in London 2012, the concert he mentioned, when they first sang this song together
Rolling Stone has posted your video FYI  https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/watch-mccartney-springsteen-play-i-saw-her-standing-there-w503567
Thank you.
I was there!
Thanks God
É ÓTIMO COMO CANTOR. ABRAÇO.
Stevie!!!
Me too
why the crowd are humming?
Did I hear people booing??? Why on earth would they do that??????
Is the crowd booing?
Thought he was dead.
Boo!!
the only thing I don't like about this is that Springsteen is faking it on guitar - you'd think he would learn the song and play along - it's only 5 chords
why the crowd are humming?
Her little voices are going to get old fast.
is she a cartoon or wtf?
I see y offset fw her. She goofy and funny asf and she bad. Cuz winning😂😂💯
That moment when Bodak Yellow comes on while watching at 2:41 am
Why does she talk like that??????? Lol wtf. I see u girl lol
She lowkey intelligent but nobody wants to see that so she puts on the bugs bunny personality
She is so down to earth.  I think she will last in the business for a while.  I don't think that she won't have her stuff together.  She's smart and will learn the ropes really fast. She danced and got out.  She could have settled with that life but she wanted better.  That's hustle.  She has a lot of options before her.
Being a Libra is so hard. We over analyze everything😂😂😂..smh Love Cardi!
And you all respect this chick? Like really this shit is damaging.
@Cardi B NY officer put her in a chokehold:)
I think people like her not because of her positive energy but because of her honesty!
“I’m evolving, but it’s like, I’m not all the way evolved!”  ☠️
I love seeing her win!
Yep I hit him up and asked him cause he never wanted to play her mixtape
I fking love her! she's funny af!
Ask her why she went off on my nigga Zias
im so proud of her..she deserves it
Everybody forgot the original no flock got kodak on the charts
she always gives good interviews.
Proud of you Cardi, do your thing. Not everyone will be articulate. You don't have be intelligent to do smart stuff. I wish you all the best and success.
They were obviously told to support her non talking self..smh her songs are catchy but she is not someone I would want my daughter to look up to. Thesetup##
She's me I didn't get my license until 24 and I've been driving 😂😂😂😂
All in all she has a great spirt and ppl gravitate towards that 👍🏽!
I usually don't get confuse but i'm confuse that charlamagnethagod don't know the necessary steps it takes to reach #1
I'm proud of Cardi
Damn her sister is gay now? Lol that was my dream
...u know what the reward is for good work?\n...more work.
Is that how she really talks ?
Say what you want but shorty busted her ass and if you can't respect that you just a hating Ass sucka
How can you not like her goofy self
I'm so happy for you Cardi. Do this.
You can hear her thick latina accent, I'm definitely attracted to that. Ño im shayn?
she has a epic nose
I absolutely love her. Pull up is my SHIT
I got love for her.  most bitches ain't big enough to admit who they were inspired by.  .....Kodak black
I love her lmfaoooooo she super turnt today tho 😂
Did y'all notice how she changed the subject when they asked her about Nicki 🤔🤔🤔
I'm happy for her everyone doubted her
Ya'll need to GO BUY THIS RECORD. ITS 69 CENTS. If you bought it then go buy it again on iTunes. If you got Spotify go stream it!!!!!!
It's truly so fucking sad what hip hop has come to...y'all ain't interviewing a nas an Eminem a jay z instead y'all are interviewing special ed rappers
Cardi B is scared to have beef with Nicki . I know y'all have noticed that every time cardi is interviewed and asked about nicki , cardi freezes up, puts on the funny voice as a distraction, and try's to dodge the question very quickly by going into a different conversation ,  😂😂😂 and so forth . Even Charlemagne's the god, had to come back in this interview and ask cardi did she have beef with nicki cause they all know cardi dodged the question 😂😂 I done seen cardi do this several times when questioned about nicki. Cardi can't win a rap beef with nicki like remy did with nicki. 💯 y'all please get that thru y'all head that cardi is not remy so nicki would burry her 💯💁🏽 (cardi) that would be the worst mistake cardi would ever do 💯😱👀
Guinness world record for most annoying voice by a female being .....congratulations cardi
This is why you shouldn't do drugs people
Wtf did I just watch. She just lost a fan.
she has to stop that crazy as talking one day. shes going to be big, so she has to start acting like she has some class. After so many times, its no longer funny. ITs getting old. but other than that..shes good at what she does.
She high on someshit lol she should've stayed sober for this one,white America goin get scared of her and not follow her
How does offset put up with her annoying ass
This interview was awesome!! I'm rooting for you Cardi!!!
It'll definitely get shot up🤣🤣🤣 lol Envy be on some other shit i swear!!
She high on something in this interview
Why is she talking like that? New retard in charge here
does she ever stop smiling?\nher and Kanye goin be arch enemies.
Zias is my nigga and she broke Zias phone so ........⛈
What do you need to do to make Cardi-B the number 1 female rapper without a feature? Can you SIGN a petition?
so cute i love cardi \ncan i have you
She sounded like she had a dick in her mouth !
She is such a beautiful soul! But you can tell she needs a bit more help expressing herself. I truly love seeing her win
G.E.D should be get every dolla albums 1 through 5
I'm about to buy bodak yellow just so she can make it to #1!
check out this energy... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlKKf-Tk6JU
You can tell when Charlemagne really fucks with a person. He really likes Cardi. He acts the same with Ed Sheeran.
This interview just made a fan out of me.
she is irritating as hell
I don't know why ppl mad at cardi, Let shawty make her coins
Why does she act so trashy? Her song was catchy, yeah, but I can't get past her personality. It's terrible. :/
This is the world we live in... Her annoyingly childish gibberish is so stupid... Why does she think that's funny? It's retarded.
her voice is extremely annoying
Just laugh it off when she show her incredible ignorance to provide cover so the audience will continue to make excuses for her stupidity. This is unbelievable that this girl can't make a complete sensible sentence lol
Love that energy she mad silly....Not too proud to be herself...I'm happy for her success her Dominican crazy ass...#Dominicansarethebest
FoH
Text everybody the link shooot. lol
money aint changed her tho
I love her ❤️❤️❤️

couldn't watch the whole interview
The design of iPhone X sucks\nI hate the design\nSteel... really??!!!\nI would prefer aluminum
I DONT CARE. I STILL BUY IT
Wireless charging and facial recognition been out for a while now. Apple is trying to keep up with its competitors by adding stuff that’s already been out in the iPhone X. Plus $999 is way too much to be paying for a smartphone.
I'm living in the Netherlands and here is the iPhone X €1159😭😭😭😭
I don't understand people. First, you guys complain 32 gigs isn't enough for a base model..... Ok so now they make 64 Gigs the base model, now that isn't good enough? Not everyone who is going to buy the phone is a media junkie. It should have, expandable storage anyway. I mean my S7 Edge is 32 gigs and I am not even close to filling it. Second, so many people,complained about apples chins now that they found a way to get rid of it, and utilize the size of a smaller chassis yet making the screen bigger to me is good. I would rather have a smaller chassis to hold then a big chassis while struggling to use my phone one-handed.
''Leading design'' 2 years behind using Samsung technology.\nApple users are dumb snobs.
Once they look at the 56$ or 59$ per month, people will forget about the full price of the 1k$ and i am dead sure loads of people will buy it because suddenly 56$ will seem more affordable.. they wont remember the full price. Also , if they are going to exchange it after one year, they are not paying the full price.
People here saying that some Samsung phones' face scanner works perfectly. K.\n\n\n\n(Holds up picture of random person to unlock their Samsung) Lol
The design is just pure cancer and I like Apple ans all that but I think Steve jobs made the company EVEN more worst. Add out the headphone jack. When it takes courage... no. I dont like it. And add our the home button? What can go worse than that??? And Apple is copying androids funcation where you swipe at the bottom of you phone. It shows a triangle, circle, square. I think Apple needs to make budget phones.
it looks like a damn samsung
I have a s6 edge, its a good phone, I would love to have a note 8, or an s8, the x is just a complete ripoff, it should be 750 or less, the s8 is simply a better phone
who else has the 5s?
U r rite..it is getting pretty expensive...they do look really nice 👍...
Ha ha! That camera bump is hilarious! This phone will be the true test! If you buy this piece of junk, you are definitely an iSheep! You may have to wear a brown paper bag over your head when using it in public... this phone is a joke! ha ha... or iHA iHA iHA!
iphone x: 4k at 60fps video\nNote 8: 4k at 30fps video\niphone x: 1080p 240fps slow mo\nNote 8: 720p 240fps slow mo\niphone x: 3D and Infrared front facing cameras that work in the dark. is more secure than fingerprint verification.\nNote 8: Single camera Facial recognition that is easily fooled by a picture and cannot be used in the dark or sharp angles.\niphone x: battery life extended by 2hrs compared to the previous generation.\nNote 8: Smaller battery than it's predecessor (Note 7) 🔥\niphone x: A11 bionic single core score of 4204 and multicore score of 10,165\nNote 8: Snapdragon 835 single core score of 1917 and multicore score of 6643\n\nhmm 🤔 Iphone X shoots better quality video, takes better quality selfies with portrait mode via 3D sensors, Has the most secure biometric reader, and is the fastest phone that competes on the level of laptops? It's not even close! why choose a Slow-sung at almost half the speed of an Iphone CPU?
So you are saying to wait, I have the iPhone 5, so should I get the iPhone 8 or the iPhone X, as I'm going to get a new phone anyway
where can i get a dbrand skin for my iphone x
The phone isn't even not even out yet and here you have pathetic people slamming it already.  It's worst than the presidential election.
No matter how rubbish the new iphone x is, i will buy it. Not only me but also those others who knows how reliable and awesome iphone is. Every year we see haters but still every year apple outsell previous year sell.
next iphone should come with a saliva test!
What an ugly phone. Did they just stick that camera on the back with chewing gum or something?
Boi he has it already
Wish apple would of put a led notification light on the x
And the back camera ..!!! Its really shit man also the backlight of mac book pro apple logo where it is dam its getting sick ...!!!! :(
This video summed up:\n\n10 reasons to not get the iPhone X!!\n\n“I will still personally be getting the iPhone X”
Someone please feel his forehead to see if he has a fever , he's  telling the truth about apple
Is all this really necessary for a phone? Do we REALLY need a face scanner? Touch ID worked perfect and a simple combination lock is well enough. We DONT need all this fancy crap and it feels like we're upgrading these phones just for the fun of it
Man... Apple will do anything to squeeze another buck out of customers.  Like making new features that you have to go buy 50 or 60 more dollars worth of crap from them in order for the features to even work...
expensive xDDDD in poland new iphone is for 1500$
I myself is still not sure.
I agree to all your reasoning because they are the sad truth about iphone X i have an iphone 7 plus but i dont think wont be changing to X this soon
the se is great the battery is quite good fits right in my hand headphone jack hasn't broke yet and i'm a clutz
There are plenty of reasons to not buy ANYTHING...we are all adults who work...make up your own mind and buy whatever you want...or not...not against making an informed decision though...me personally, I'm a iphone person and I'm not getting it because I can't see myself paying that much for a phone...I am interested in the 8 though...I skipped the 7 just for the 8 so we will see the reviews when the X comes out.
I hate the dual lens camera. Looks too much like a Samsung. Steve jobs wouldn’t have approved. I like the small circle camera. Nice and simple. Iphone should be simple
It's not worth 1k
The first buyers of the iPhone X are going to be mere beta testers for the next year or two until the newer, improved next generation model is released. Naturally, the first generation of the iPhone X will become an instant hit, quickly sell out, and will not be in full stock until spring of the following year as usual. The Apple message boards will be littered with frustrated users expressing problems with the phone, while others will take to eBay to sell the already expensive phone at a much higher price. This happens year after year, so this cycle will not be any different.
I swear to god every update they make is designed to make the older iPhones slower and slower until you get annoyed with it
Doing it.

Hi how to unlock icloud
apple is retarded XD
Expect iOS11 to Deliberately cripple older models.
HEY MY IPHONE 5c HAS 2GB
Buying IPhone 8. 👌🏻
How im gonna to cheat
Crazy apple !!
only 10 ?
NOTICE TO EverythingApplePro: YOU SUCK! You suck your mum's ***s. I wish people like you would stop ordering me about and telling me what I should buy or not buy. I guess that if you think it sucks that you can do better can you? What have to done with your waste of life? What have you done to advance humanity in anyway? That's right all you do is complain about everything and rip other people's work apart just to seem like a big shot on Youtube.
there are no reasons not to buy it
you started to change my opinion about the iphone X then you say i will still be getting it I smiled and was like yep all the youtubers that say dont buy it say at the end im still getting it. I am still getting it to lmao
😂😂😂 phones have already been expensive tell us something we don't know
Ass hole that's a samsung fuck you
The iPhone is too expensive 🤑🤑🤑🤑.
I don’t see how a slight increase in price can make it sound like it cost $1million dollars. If you do a payment plan it’ll only be like $17 dollars more monthly... is that really much more? I’m sure you all spend $17 on stupid things
ONLY MUPPETS WILL BUY THIS PHONE..  THE NEED THERE HEADS EXAMINED
I had my hopes up on getting the iphone x now this video is giving me second thoughts
Who has the iphone 7 and is going to update to 8 plus?
In Swiss the price is 1200 and 1400 Chf 🤣🤣🤣 No way! I go with Samsung in the future.
The biggest reason not to buy it was stated...you are approving Apple setting the entry level price on this and future iPhones​ at $1000. As it is, they are forcing that price point by raising the new iPhone 8 price a little to close the otherwise $250 price gap with the iPhone X.
I can't get past that ugly af sensors....the pic with with that What if design I probably would've switched...
Lol why wernt you invited to check the iphone X and 8 out
Nobody has a real iPhone X Or 8,8+ yet so no real comparisons can be made until after they are released. Apple may watch all the reviews and shit right now and still could be enhancing the phone based off the negative things that are said about the phones. When it releases about everyone who dislikes will still want it & is still willing to buy it. PS. It's not going to be exactly a thousand dollars, may even be less with good credit. Think!
posts a video about why you shouldnt buy the phone.. then at the end tells you he is going to buy it lmao
Let me tell you 10 resaon not to buy the iPhone X, but oh I'm still going to buy it though. Fucking iPhone fan boys kill me.😂😂😂😂😂
Samsung is my city
There is no i phone x with a whote front it will be black.\nHow u got that fake?:D
Y'all do no that everybody $$$$$ is not the same so there will be a lot of ppl buying this phone just because they can afford it 😜😉 just saying we all not broke 😂
so U GONNA BUY IPHONE 10 EVERYTHINGAPPLEPRO?? COZ U MENTIONED IN THE VID
This has the specs of a Samsung s6 hahaha oh the i sheep
Buy an S8, get a better phone and save yourself £300.  Use that £300 you saved to get a big ass SD card(or a few) and whatever else you want for it.
iPhones they all the same
$1000 bucks alone is good enough reason not to buy it.
I don't like how apple always releases a new phone like every year, they don't give people enough time to enjoy they phone they just bought for over $700 smh they do this to pressure people into updating their phone so they don't feel left out lol
Disappointed with the iPhone X. Waiting for the Pixel 2.
13 reasons why you shouldn't buy the iPhone 13
Dont like the cam anyway. Also price is sky rocketing
0:32 seconds, is EAP's name Philip?
I love all of the people saying samsung here I come. Samsung phones suck dick guys. They work for a few months and then turn into shit. Android is laggy and bloated, and iOS is a way better and clean experience. Amazing app support, A11 bionic makes the S8 chip look like dog shit, and there are 1000000 more accessories made for iphone than any android phones. \n\nHave fun with your garbage while iPhone continues to wipe the floor with any android phone ever
HI bro its me mr dude57 ,we met in the chat on Rick and morty
isheep waste your money on this useless device that costs around 413 to make and they sell it for 1000 lol
wouldn't the next model, iPhone 9, possibly have the same design as the X just with newer/improved features at a lower cost? Why spend over a grand for a phone
Reason #11 you've been holding dummy units for so long and know everything about it before launch so that it already feels old / uninteresting.
The Galaxy S8 has the same quality display whit no notch, a lower price,  a fingerprint scanner, expandable memory  and a face detection system that actuality works.  You can check out more reviews on my blog http://hitech.deals
I am starting to hate Apple. Greedy fucks.
Just ordered the s8 from amazon for 535 pound almost half the iphone x!!!!
I hate that because the iPhone X is one of the most anticipated iPhones in YEARS, YouTubers know that if they makes videos like Reasons NOT to but the iPhone X they will get hella views. I know that Everythingapplepro is stoked for iPhone X, yet, he makes this video just because he will get views. Look at the views on this video compared to his other ones. #DisappointedAppleFanboy
hey dawg how much dat samsung COM pay for u
Revolutionary new product?? LOL :D
iPhone 7 ate 9
HAHA apple fucked up awesome
Apple are shit
best underestimated phones in 2017\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNwhmFiO7s&t=24s
kkjjlkkk
Just 10?......
I like note 8
In China it is selling over 1300 bucks and know what, it is manufacturer in China. ... 1300bucks for a phone, ridiculous.... that's normal 2month income for common Chinese labor....
They stole the Samsung's concept \n\n\n\n\n*I never buying this*
iPhone Xpensive \n\n\n\n\n\nYa, you see dat^? ya somebody already typed that and he had 948 likes so ye imma get a bunch of likes on this then ill change my comment peace
This is sad and creepy af. \nDude whacks it off and makes some good cash 💰 and reunites with his kids on a tv special (probably to make more cash) almost 20 to 25 years later and he's a great guy\nWtf is this world coming to? (no pun intended)
lmao they all have his nose
Well... This is the future guys.
hmmm he's a sexy dad
IS HE MY DAD OR GRANDPA BECAUSE MY LAST NAME IS RUBINO AND IVE NEVER MET ANYONE WITH THAT LAST NAME BESIDES FAMILY
I think it's nice that he helped other people to have children and those children appreciate him enough to visit him; he'll never spend a lonely day in his life. I don't think there's anything wrong with it. Thanks Mike
Jon Snow and the 7 bastard dwarves
Mike's been keeping his hands busy
19 kids and counting
So every time you Jerk Off and dispose your cum. Does that count as murder?
Man, if I found out I had 18 half brothers and sisters, the last I would want to do is meet them. I barely talk to the two I have.
ages 16-21 my ass most of them look 30
LMAO at 1:47 two of the girls have Snapchat filters on the photos he framed and put on his mantle. 😂💀
It's so sweet how open he was to getting to know all of them meanwhile so many actual fathers take zero interest or responsibility for their kids
It'd be kinda nice to be a part of that.
I can't remember the name of the movie. It's exactly like this
When the squad hasn't seen eachother in forever. I'm sorry... I try.
White people doing the most
Guys a Racist no black kids
what's ur dad like? i wanna meet that dad
His pull out game is weak
WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST WATCH
-We have our daddys sperm in common
I wouldve never made these ugly children
He needs to be called by his name or Mr. Sperm Donor.....to call him Dad is an insult to every Man that has actually  MADE ALL OF THE SACRIFICES to RAISE THE CHILD.
I bet some of them sleep together in the past no wonder some of them has shame on their faces.
2:23 I have a feeling she says it alot, if you know what I mean
I wish I'm good looking and tall as a man... i'm only 5'4 and can't donate sperm for money. Literally free money.
And all you jerk offs out here just waste your cum for nothing
I honestly wonder if any of the kids were attracted to each. There is a phenomenon that causes incest with separated family members.
Goes to show being fat isn't genes but habits one tht  fat girl lol
Lucky man some people don't have children in will love  to donate?
wait for the alimony of good luck
This nigga has 19 children and I can't even get a text back.
Too sweet...he has done jus what God wanted us to do....MULTIPLY!!!!🤔😊...seems lik a nice man as well
1:31 she looks like Scarlett Johansson the voice is similar too
А мужик молоток, и детей наплодил, гены свои передал, и от воспитания увернулся на совершенно законных основаниях.
Now I can just imagine like a boyfriend and a girlfriend in the morning getting ready, and the dudes like ''Jessica I'm going out to see my dad'' and then Jessica's like ''yeah me too!'' And then they get there and go in the door and they're like ''JUSTIN?!'' ''JESSICA?'' And then they have really incest kids
Did his kid just call him mike? 1:45 I'd be getting a can of whoop ass if I called my dad by his name lol 😂
This Guy Must Be Petter North.....
So whacking off into a cup and having random women you've never met give birth makes you a father...??\nHow beautiful.
This nigga's been copy and pasted onto a woman's body
Cool. I'm sure the others who chose to be anonymous probably unknowingly had sex with one of their offspring 😯😰😖
they all have the same nose.
You know some of those boys where thinking damn it I have so many hot sisters.
tf
Damn not bad looking kids.
This is so wholesome. Don't even bother reading the comments though.
This is the weirdest family reunion I've ever seen.
There were no conception problems, their mothers were all so ugly, no guy in his right mind was going to throw the hotdog down the hallway. That's why the donor is so handsome and his kids so ugly.
Wtf is this doin in my trending?I'm a jaffa
This is weird af 😂
What a great story
Lol he has some hot daughters
Hey remember when you were inside me? (Hard pause).
He looks at them.....omg, you where all once in my balls 😲
he might have been your father, but he'll never be your daddy boy
Vince vaughn had a movie like this
Is it just me or does it look like none of these kids were raised by hood rats?
If he was black, the comments would be TOTALLY different. Every stereotype under the sun would be spewed and no facts would be considered.
2:00 stroking a dog suggests passion for animals?
Americans have a weird funny face. It's like they all squint.
Американец Майкл Рубино в молодости был донором спермы. Недавно он встретился со своими 19 биологическими детьми.
Он за один раз сделал столько клонов? Или 19 раз включал свой принтер?
Вообще мужик не выглядит счастливым, скорее расстроенным. В его глазах читается: как вы меня все зае***ли, дети мои. Самое забавное что почти все дети похожи между собой.
Dad?
Julhreeze
Hell no
seems like a maury episode
Yuck
Hello number 9
Lmfao

Décadence sociétal
Delivery Man

Delivery man anyone?
Ummm...what?!
Wow!!
Wierd
Wow

Nie jedną by wyruchał jeszcze :v
Family guy?\nAnyone?\nNo? Hahaha
Super weird
Real life 'Vicky Donor'
White pants is real smashable.
Delivery Man
Imagine just looking at you're cumshots😐
He masturbates a lot
All raised by crazy cat ladies who couldn't find a man.  This is not ok.
So did they all shake his hand first?
Think the fat one blames being fatcon genetics ?
They aren't his kids
*Cringy af*
Aww, that's so adowable!
So 19 women, decided they wanted him? To be there sperm donor. And that means 19 women were single moms, because none of the kids had previous dad figures in there life....wow im shocked. None of those moms could find a husband

Eu sei que ninguém vai entender, mas vamo lá Paulinho
Messi will always be Messi no matter wat..thanks for the pass
http://www.ermail.com/klik/UHJQamcM\nHey Guys check on this link and have fun.  Great to enjoy.  Have fun and earn and good game too.
Please, next time don't put final score on the title. Thank you
Dembele is out for half the season 4-5 months
how can barca be this bad?? it doesn't make any sense...
Glory supports are real in these comments thinking they know shit stfu 10 year olds
Spanish people are fucking retarded, look how their commentators sound
Predict sound credibility born obviously international orange freeze gate even.
Why is pique still in the squad? He's just getting older and horrible as a defender. Time to drop him asap
La Liga stadiums always seem to have empty seats lol.
That freekick by messi was so good and the goalkeeper managed to make a world class save. The curve was perfect, what a save from the goalkeeper.
Gaku Shibasaki👍\nProud of him being Japanese🇯🇵
pliz dont discuss signings... its over now ,more over d coach know how to use them n at what position ..juz enjoy barca ...d beauty of football....gr8 goals nyways
What a goal by the Japanese dude!! And what a save on Messi's free kick!
Barcelona's defend is fantastic with umtiti and semedo
Pique was terrible in this game
Who else want semedo in starting eleven like
Remember these are the sort of games barca lost or drew last season which cost them la liga. So a brilliant start.
If you say goal again i hope your mother dies of cancer
He is strong.. He can be a false number 9😐
Is Barcelona become AS Roma??? jk
The Getafe goal was from Mars .
WE THE FANS OF BARCELONA, castigated PAULINHO....why? I mean seriously PAULINHO .....he is coming to D GREAT BARCELONA....NO PLZ ...but when he arrived to d great Barcelona,  MY Realmadrid, MU, Chelsea  fans  made fun of me and they used to say this is the level of barcelona ......What I replied them...wait and watch bcoz we are just fans and don't know the capability of other players who played in different countries and with different clubs....SCOUTS R THERE....and they brought him to D GREAT BARCELONA......IT MEANS, SOMETHING IS THERE........AND NOW important 3 PTS, due to this 3 pts, last  year we lost laliga .....
Where are the fouls done on suarez which shd have been penalties
Ter Stegen again & again. Making same mistake like he did last time vs Real Madrid. He should learn to stay at goalpost to widened the distance & increase the chance to block long shoot. If he doesn't learn this, sooner or later he will end up being burden to the team again. Neuer, Navas & Buffon have better knowledge on this
FC Roma xD? 3rd kit is similar to roma no?
Asian football is improving, Japan has a very strong national side so does Iran! And China is starting to get on the right track as they are spending billions on the football not only buying big names from abroad but also on its youth program! I see China to top Asia in the next two decades time! They will have a very bright future
A clear penalty for getafe and a red card for pique but as always UEFAlona gets away with it
Neymar one of the best player out off the team but messi is wonderful
This team is nothing. They might as well trade Suarez and Messi.
5:03 lol, look at Jordi Alba getting on his knees! It´s been a while since Leo shot a freekick like that.
roberto is not for semedo position. If he wanted to replace him and give him some rest he should put vidal in and roberto is great in the midfielder, but really our midfielder sucked today but whatever new coach is doing it is working so far and new Kit away for barca this season is poor, red not cool at all, not barca colour at all.
നെയ്മർ ഇല്ലങ്കിൽ നമ്മൾ ജയികും
He scored 1 goal wtf why is everyone bumming him now
NOOOO WHY DEMBOUZ?😢❤
Vai Corinthians Paulinho

XVIDEOS -----> GETAFE. YOU WON'T BELIEVE 👌👏👏👏
Yes, Paulinho my BOOOOY!!!
Paulinho!🔥
Nacer brasileño es nacer con el futbol en las venas cuando no aparece el mejor del mundo LEO o SUAREZ MORDELON aparece otro mostro como  paulinho dejen que agarre ritmo para que lo vean crecer \nLastimosamente se lesiono Ousmane Dembélé pronta recuperación
Paulinho 🐂🐂🐂🐂💪💪💪💪
Paulinho body balance =  99
No se porque pero este nuevo  AS ROMA no me gusta!
Cabrones enseñen el penalti a Suarez que no pitó el arbitro
Dios mío!!!!! El estadio del Getafe lleno!!!!! The end is near!!!! Pedid un deseo!!!!!!
2:24 fuera de juego no pitado que no cuesta un gol por muy poco. Pero no pasa nada que es contra el Barça, así que 0 repeticiones, ni se comentó. Todo OK
Está para gol del año el del año el de getafe
sigo pensando que paulinho no vale eso :/
Cual es el nombre de los narradores
Pauliño marco, porque al defensor de Getafe le falta experiencia. Prácticamente lo dejo avanzar. Aunque le voy al Barcelona, reconozco las cosas como son. JUGARON MAL, El equipo no se acopla.  Este año no hay liga, ni copa, ni nada para el Barcelona. Este año solo Fichajes POPULISTAS, pero NINGÚN planteamiento serio. Jugadores MALOS. Mas de expectativas que de resultados!  Los buenos jugadores demuestran quien son, estén donde estén. Y ese grupito para mi no tiene nada especial de nada.
Pigue nie bzyknął Shakiry przed meczem bo to jaki ten chłop gra ostatnio piach to masakra:/ Potrzebny stoper od zaraz
My dumbass thought Barca were Roma
Paulinho gemius🏆🏆🏆
Spanish is such a beautiful language. I could listen to a woman cuss me out in it and I'd just have the best time ever.
I love you Shakira 😍😍😍
Valdrá la pena,cuando te este besando
she is still so beautiful

Ni siquiera iba en el segundo 40 y ya sabia que al final le iba a poner dislike .-.
México nesesita ayuda temblo y hay muchos heridos edificios caídos nesesitamos agua comida lámparas ayuda tienen que difundir este mensaje
Me encanta Shakira, pero ya cansa con lo mismo. Que le pasó a su creatividad? Esta canción suena a  me enamore y a la que grabó con Maluma.
Para mas music aquí https://goo.gl/rUFWi9
Colombiaaa papá... 100 pa este tema....
Con quien le falta cantar a shakira ?? Ojo al cantar en la ducha capaz se te aparece
Wouldn't it be great if she did an underground Album with music styles from back in the days like; Pies Descalzos: Dónde Estás Corazón, Sueños Blancos, Estoy aquí...
Se mueve como lombriz con ataques, ya pasó de sexy a ridícula
un gran tema nicki jam se saco la visera
Antes Pitbull ahora Nicky Jam, que se viene ahora?????? Como extraño ese duo con Alejandro Sanz. El nombre de la canción ya lo cag...
Enloque que quesí cuando la vi pelirroja, como en los 90´s
Se la voy a dedicar a mi primo de medellin el se enamoro de mi y creo que si llego a rechasarlo no me lo perdonaria aunque..... No me lo a pedido y si me lo pide grabare para mi canal una broma diciendo que ya tenia novio despues se lo aclarare
Shakira, es mi cantante favorita, pero me carga la voz de este tipo y el reggaetón, espero luego siga con ese pop latino y en inglés que tanto me encanta...
Queria Shakira podrias hacer canciones con verdadero sentido denuevo?  Can you make meaningful songs again like before?  If you dont youre just an annoying frog/toad singing idiotic words.
Esto me suena a algo relacionado con la ruptura con Piqué.
La ame con el cabello rojooo.. 😍😍😍❤️❤️
Lastima que shakira utilizara su look noventero en una cancion de regueeton 😒
Forever Azerbaijan
La mejor cancion
💩Asco la coreografía💩

Soy yo o nuestra Shaki se puso boobies?
Men encanta me hace recordar a tantas mujeres
Yo tengo miedo de que me guste y que valla a enloquecer 😍🎶
soy Fan De Shakira Desde Mis 12 Años De Edad y hoy tengo 26 Años... No estoy Nada Conforme Con este Video... Esperava Algo mas Explocito y Fino....shakira es una Cantante Bien Consagrada y Nicky Jam Igual... Pero el Video esta pesimo..
Escucho y escucho esta canción  Y más me encanta.. excelente canción  shakira y Nicky jam lo mejor del Memento..👏👏👏👌👌 Felicitaciones ..
Muy Buena ✌
Pray FOR MEXICO😔🙏🙏🙏🙏🏽🙏🏽
yo te amaba ya no buuuu
Pero que pena tener que admitirlo, a shakira ya no se le va los videos con ropa interior a la verdad me parece que esta muy mal de cuerpo, muy aguada... los años no llegan solos; yo pienso que ella deberia reconsiderar el hecho de salir en videos con poca ropa, ya no mas; que oso....
#ShakiraNoMasReggaeton:c
Pelao!
Porque Shakira es tan porno ...?
Jaume y su equipo de trabajo debería hacerle un favor a Shakira y largarse de su vida para siempre, antes, cuando vivía en Estados Unidos, ella era un éxito en todo, ahora no.
💔🌸
Qué hermoso le queda el labial rojo!
Excelente poder latino
siempre pienso que no puede impresionarmee mas, y lo hace😍 👍
En cada vez que hase un video vivo chakira mueve muy  bien las cadera like pa que siga hasi
Shakira is so beautiful.  I miss her old rock music and arabic music.

Middlesbrough fan but what a block by qpr on the goal line
What an interesting game.
3rd goal was off
trffcv
another loss under holloway, stats are apalling, i agree the ball was out for boro third goal
Screenshot, looks just out to me.\ns26.postimg.org/3mkgxujh3/out.jpg
That ref and linesman are a joke,that was obviously over the line
QPR two very lucky goals Boro made hard work of it UTB
After it was 2-2 I new Middlesbrough would score a third cause it's QPR and we also through it away.
We still didn't deserve to win. Our second goal was very scrappy
Trending with 7.3k views? Hah
Go on furlong lad 👏
UTB
WHAT THE FUCK LINO
Your fuckin shit
Qpr have more youtube subscribers then stadium capacity lol
The ball was out of play for their 3rd goal?!
Why is this trending tho?
Deserved at least a point.
Should of been 4 or 5 Leeds got off lightly ... COYL
I would have loved an offside cam on Morison on that first one.
MILLLLLLLLL
Milllllllll
I can only imagine how much fun josh is having right now. Poor simon
5k views and this is 5th on trending. gg YouTube.
Why the hell is this trending in India?
Great goal keeping...that's all I have to say...🤐
Top of the league, your having a laugh!
Millwall the laughing stock of London
play offs why not never say never
I bet Millwall payed YouTube to put this on trending
Bad day at the office for leeds but credit to millwall they were all over us and fully deserved the win. Good luck for the rest of the season mfc apart from when u play us again obviously. MOT
WHAT IS IN TRENDING IN SERBIA???
Trending !!!!?!!
MILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
ALAW
Trending? YouTube go home your wasted.
millwall. fuck em all
Mill wall pricks
Leeds are shit who agrees like rhis
Total domination.1-0 mullering if ever there can be one.
Offside u scums
AOB like Chicharito with the deflected shots in :D
I watched this live a guy fell down the Millwall steps and cut his head open blood everywhere he was drunk
Well done Millwall from a Wednesday fan! We all hate Leeds scum.
The only time millwall will show up all season. Mark my words.

No coincidence that the first time arsenal have ever looked like not getting thumped by a big time is when ozil doesn't play. That was the most solid arsenal defensive/midfield performnce vs a big team in years. Deserved point for both teams. Arsenal barely created anything second half but considering they are away from home draw Fair result
Harvey Price long lost father
The best game Robbie went to this weekend was MK Dons nice to meet you mate.
I don't watch football. But this guy sounds important.
Robbie's got the sniffles
Is that the M1 just north of Dunstable you're driving on?
Another 2-1 prediction from Robbie. If his predictions had all come true Arsenal would be on a winning streak going back years and years.
15-0 South Africa in the 12th inning of the second round. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNailed it.
0-0chelsea/arsenal\nif I get it right you need to sub to my channel
Sumfin had some bubble at the border an got in some barney wiv the rozzers coz he ain't got enuff bangers in is rocket for a week long stay so the home office told im to bugger orf up is own end
how is this on trending 😂😂
come then you muppets, its dead innit, all the critics dashed
Notice how he's such a slow driver that he never drives past another car but he is always being overtaken
Robbie looks like a black version of sloth from the Goonies
My boys, chelsea fc keeping it real, unlucky on your win
How was your entertaining draw?\nhttps://www.google.de/amp/s/talksport.com/football/listen-arsenal-fan-praises-fantastic-cologne-supporters-i-wish-gunners-fans-were%3famp
As usual just lately it will depend upon which arsenal team shows up ,we have proven we can beat them!!!!!!!!!!!...but ill settle for a point,
you can only be dreaming imagining a Chelsea defeat. home and better. in all level.
My brother said if arsenal wins he will swim in the River Don 😂
he only got up for the match for the views
Bit dangerous doing this while driving? Need to show respect to other road users
we are in big trouble!!!! our formation means fabby will be a free man in midfield
he has alexis on the bench like wtf... iwobi is starting
how can you not love Robbie? i aint even a arsenal fan but i just love him troopz+DT true passionate fans
You cant miss this game ? ?  I dont understand what is so special about getting humiliated .
I guarantee if Chelsea win this video will be deleted
first,the line up has to be on point and second,they have to be up for it
GOO ARSENAL , WE CAN DO THIS
Shame Sanchez is not starting but still a great lineup got Kolasinac powering down the wing he will cause trouble, then we can bring Sanchez on later to finish them #COYG
they dont have there best two players on the pitch. Wtf wenger
The small pitch doesn't suit arsenal
i feel like everyone thinks Chelsea is gonna win then arsenal gonna win and people gonna be shocked.people gonna cheer when they thought arsenal was gonna win wtf
If he start the right team we are going to be a victor trust Lacazzette  will score alongside Alexis.
Robbie, I feel sorry for you because we're not going to do this \n\nFor all the reasons you listed I predict....\nChelsea 4\nArsenal 1
We are going to win with 0:6💪💪💪
Dude I'm waiting for your post match cries 😂😂
4-1 Chelsea, Xhaka red card. Sorry but we're terrible like that. Wenger will of course blame the ref etc.
Robbie is ill..they gonna bottle it again..im a goonner but it's the reality
imagine sitting next to him for a plane journey
1 sniff 2 sniff 3 sniff
As soon as I heard Ozil was not playing I knew we had a chance. For once we had 11 v 11 from the start in a big game.
0-0 not bad....\n\nChelsea are shite this year...
Come on AFC beat CFC today! For Man City
Arsenal should be 3-0 up at half time, Chelsea playing for a draw against their biggest rivals yet again
Arsenal don't stand a chance
We played second team against Cologne ??? \nWhat match was i watching LOL\nwe played our first team in europa Robbie.. Only ozil ,ramsay and laca didn't play.. (Xhaka being there not being there doesn't really make any difference)
Draw would be a good result for us but i hope we would win it
Robbie's comments...,I can only say I wish,lets have Laca,Sanchez and Ozil all on and on fire. then maybe  Robbie will be right
Get this shit off trending now
Lol this is on trending
you wish.
jesus christ thats one ugly mug

Have to give Arsenal credit today they were solid all day but poor in the final 3rd #MUFC
Good game. Everyone played well apart from iwobi!  He looked lost and just looked lazy.Even ramesy played well
COYGGGG....SHOW SOME FIGHT! We have to make sure were not exposed at the back, like we were against Liverpool.
HAHAHAHAHA TRIFFIC RESULT FOR SPURS
Why is this trending now lol
Blame the whitey right?
Why is this trending? But it's cool. One day I will be on trending
Why does every show about black people somehow have to mention how much they hate white people lmao
Season 2's finished, why is this trending now?
nice job youtube
It's reparations 😂
damnnnn back at it again with the frank ocean stuff woohwooooh
white people complaining in the comment section.....don't worry be happy 😂
Why the fuck is this trending,.? Hardly believable. YouTube is not even trying to hide the trending manipulation anymore.
Liberals have lost their fucking minds, who on earth would want to watch this? A TV show about a black tranny?  I'm about to vomit
This is blackwashing. Why are there any white people in this?
What's with the white people hating?
Shit tv show shit acting shit black people

Someone said this is the fresh breed of black privilege and embodies typical rich BLM members. I haven't seen it but that's what people telling me
Pure ideological propaganda
Not sure why I passed on this when it first premiered, but this show looks good.
HBO is going downhill. A shame but every company has to peak at some point.
See, I get it. Its an all black cast. That's okay. There should be variety for people to find a show that they find relatable...but in game of thrones, Rick and morty, breaking bad, Shows that mainly feature white people or white writers, at no point imply they 'hate black people' by having one of the characters do something or say something racist.\nSo why do we think its okay for shows like this to have an underlying hit at white people?
What song is that just after the minute mark
Where the white women at????
In real black relationships the man beats the women and then leaves her and the kids to somehow make it. So I'm not really buying the whole gimmick of class and good manners that this show is trying to portray the black community as having. Maybe add in a scene of a black man squealing 'WELL DO IT THEN NIGGA!!' at one of the women who then swings her handbag at him and gets savagely knocked out to the chorus of 'WORLDSTAR!'.................then I will tune in and watch.
What is songs?
I will sub to anyone who subs me when you are done comment done:)
With and the Volskaya map I was hoping to see a Soldier 76 skin for Raynor. Sigh, sooner or later ...
Finally see some Cassia love and it's just a simple re colour. GIVE ME SOMETHING TO WORK WITH!!
Make the Captain Amari skin WITH a younger voice of Ana. That will sell crazy!
Still waiting for the Apects, Blizzard! (Especially my bae, Alexstrasza)
Except for Ana itself and D.Va Destroyer skin, nothing special. Also those cutie sprays are interesting. But no more.
Maybe add a surrender and I might come back.
Instead of pumping out alt avatars that only differ in color wouldn't it be easier to let the players pick the colors and styles of the hero they play?
They should change the sound when D.VA jump!!! for a new skin!
The zerg skins are the best...Butcherlisk, and now anubalisk! They should bring out a zerg dehaka......
great skins but i still kinda wish taht the other heroes got some new ones *cough* greymane *cough*
The artists and designers of the Heroes of the Storm team responsible for making those skins (and color palettes) are WAY better than the guys working on the Overwatch skins. Why can't we get those skins, or similar ones like that for the Overwatch heroes in the actual Overwatch game?
blizzard i want the rock 'n' roll racing larry announcer! would pay top dollar for it! ;-) pls do it!
that skin on 0:16 would fit destiny perfectly *call you in Guardian*
way too much overwatch stuff, dva has more skins then heroes that have been in since the beginning. wtf.
I still think tracers master skin looks like a todler's air plain/space shuttle costume.
Now lets see Fel-Tainted Ragnaros (green) and Cold-fire Ragnaros (Blue). Maybe even a tech-inspired skin for him as well. :)
y are the shrike recolors better than the normal one???
they should change the name to Money grab of the storm.
oh yeah, more legendary duplicates! Can't wait.
those recolors are going to pollute the lootbox pool again....
They missed the chance to call D.Va the Destroyer as D.VaBlo.
what about new skins for Greymane
Is that widowmaker at 0:55 ?
D.va the Destroyer is my new waifu.
Can this dva skin PLEASE be added to overwatch, I'd pay for SO MANY LOOTBOXES!
1:36 Deathwing spray.  Because of D.va skin or teasing new hero?
Those pachimaris need to make their way back to OW.
I want purple rib bit Lucio c:
I wish Overwatch had as many skins as HOTS. Variety is fun.
well, rip deathwing as a hero but thats fine.\nits nice that they are releasing so much content and the blizzcon is 1 month away.
FINALLY a new Varian skin.
Blizzard is killing it. Riot went stagnant after taking a crack at Blizzard's mod game, DotA. Blizzard packs a ton of content in less than half the time Riot snuck in to get paid.
now that's 1 hot dva skin
Finally an Overwatch character that isn't hyper mobile
i am dissapointed the D.va of all people got the deathwing skin... but that might just be because i REALLY hate D.va from both lore and gameplay standpoint.
they need to add monster truck from rpm racing and it will be able to run oveer terrain and kill people
Can't wait for Ana, but rip Deathwing our lord and savior... D.va's skin is very nice though!
stop making all the best skins for a game no one wants to play
Please can you look to make some skins for otherwise over looked heroes like Guldan and Nazeebo.
you can smell the destiny 2 marketing from a mile away.
so they are not going to add the beautiful captain amari skin...
PLEASE BLIZZARD WE NEED THE OW SKINS ON OW! MAKE IT HAPPEN
Would be nice with young Ana skin.
So Blizzard, you 're straped for cash? Sure fair enough, here's some of our money.
The Pachimari sprays and Player Icons are the best things in this upcoming patch. Nothing can beat Pachimari.
Sick now we need the Innkeeper!
Meanwhile I still cant bring myself to play this game anymore cause its been broken for 2 years now. Game runs flawlessly even on extreme settings but freezes for 2-3secs every minute making it totally unplayable and unenjoyable. Ive tried every fixes I found on the internet but in the end its Blizzturd who wont fix the mess they created. I used to play HOTS every day back in beta/early launch up until Skeleton king/Johanna release where an update broke the game and has turned it into a unplayable mess.
I just want a female Draenei as a playable character. :o
Nice, Arthas´s Invincible is finaly in the hots!
Well well, this fancy new D.Va skin has been obviously designed by Mei.
Still no greymane love, what a surprise
Would be so cool if we can have D.va Destroyer Skin for Overwatch aswell!
Aw, I was hoping for Junkrat to be released first.
D.Va is becoming the new Nova and Li Ming by receiving new skins and recolours every patch! xD
I need that Red Varian skin.
Where are the GENJI SKINS AT!!?!?!?!?
Varian looks like he is about to rush B...
Looks cool I hope for Junkrad next but Ana is a good choice. And a roadhog skin for Stitches please :)
We need more murlocs in the nexus.
Pink Lucio? Now I can be annoying with my skin too! :D
*sees Deathwing mech do a bunny hop* I've seen everything now..
Still waiting for something resembling Carbon Fiber Dva skin, even if it was default skin recolor.
Hey you guys got your Deathwing! Congrats Deathwing  fans!
1:55 starraptor?
Invisible horse...hollow man...HOLLOW HORSE.
That D.Va skin is hot fiyah
Wait Lucio is in Hots?
Fel D.V.A!!
Wish list:  Imperius, Selendis, Anasterian.
no captain amari skin, yikes
DEATHWING DVA LOL!!!!
i hoped junkrat first damm
Prophet Velen! ;(
skins are very destiny-ish..subliminal advertising?
Awesome more recolors to dilute the reward pool!
come to brazil
RUSH B (c) Varian
0:57 if urgot got the dunkmaster darius skin\n\n\n\nwrong game
Killer music
Pedobear Varian
D.VA IS HOT!\n... Literally
Pachi Pachi Pachi!
OW CANCER
min 1:36   Deathwing confirmed
1.Abathur skins plx !!!!!!
STILL WAITING ON ALARAK ANNOUNCER
still no greymane skins...sigh
Hots rules
Deathwing D.Va pretty sick though
hope deathwinf d.va has matching sounds
poor lunara got missed again
op op !!music name?
If Commandant Varian doesn't yell ''ANUUUU'' and/or ''CHEEKI BREEKI'' during parry then I'm uninstalling this game.
hahahaha Finally Ana Can Hit Genji to heal
音乐真难听
Oh goodie... more... sprays?
Wird jemals wieder ein Rehgar skin releast
Dommage que Varian est deux bouts de plastique au lieu des éclaires du trailer.
so, ehm nova got the widowmaker skin because u didnt want to put a second sniper into the game. Ana isn't a sniper?
More Valeera skins yet GM hasn't gotten a new skins since the Iphone 6..

He looks terrible
this is classic
Had to made for the bengals 😢😢🏈🏈
What team is he talking about?
Pffft this is...
Is this an old video or does she just look like she did 8 years ago?
miley cyrus was always the true queen of disney.
I used to sing this song when I was a child ...
She's finally out of the lesbian rebel stage and hot again 👌
Anyone is freaking about her beautiful voice(i cant deny it too) but lets take a moment too appreciate her rainbow studio is so so so similar to chicken hut in hannah montana the movie lol. Guess who is gonna watch it again?
AHHHHH I REMEMBER THIS SONG FROM MY MILEY/HANNAH MONTANA CD AHHHHHHHHH
I had forgot this song totally
awww miley i love you so much
Who else has watched this 100 times???
Nice to see the real Miley and not the vulgar, ridiculous mess she was not too long ago. Welcome back, Miley Redux.
I'm happy to see her back☺
It's fun putting your name in songs ' 😏😏😏 #Niley
Are you sure this is miley cyrus?
It took me until she said Miley to realize this was her song... I was seriously like wait oh my god who sings this again?! Dang
anyone else think this would be tyler the creators see you again lol
is this guy wearing a wig now? wasnt he bald before
I've always associated See You Again with this song of Miley, not Charlie. I'm glad I get to hear it again.
I NEVER THOUGHT THESE LYRICS  WOULD EVER LEAVE HER LIPS AGAIN BUT OMFG I WAS WRONGGGG
I AM LIVING FOR THIS
Sexy nice voice. Glad she grew her hair. Nice she looks good again. Not that bitchass short hair that she had.
The intro guitar is nearly identical to Rosanne Cash's song Seven Year Heartache.
Her new songs kinda sucked I liked this throwback
Bruh this was my favourite song when I was ten
Oh gosh this was my favorite song I just recalled all my child memories when i was a Cheerleader
Hey, a Miley song that isn't trash.
PLEASE MAKE MORE LIVES OF THE OLD SONGS! <3
This is the best!!!!!
I love that she did her old songs. 9 year old me is quaking.
I've watched this 100 times now💙 you're soul is shining love❤️
Now she needs to sing The Climb again , please
I wonder if she's still friends with Leslie lol
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE I'M LISTENING IT LIVE AGAIN
I'm glad Miley Cyrus is going back to her old self
I am in love with this so much
one of my favourite songs
I love that Miley found that medium of the rebel and the  Hanna Montana  in her >-<
when will it be avaliable on spotify? need it asap!!!!
The nostalgia, the chills. I CANNOT CONTAIN MYSELF
Wtf is she saying in 2.40?? :(
I sang this in a talent show when I was 8. I love this. And her little quip it's fun saying my name in songs, oh my god.
I'm fucking in love with this song
IM SO EXCITED THATS THE MILEY I KNOW
Her voice brings me in bigger emotions than Trump itself. :D
WOWIE i just love this
You get the limo out front (Oo Oh oo)
She needs to create a country album like yesterday!!
Is memorable Listen Miley sing that song again
DO THEY HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO US fjdjdjfjcjfbdjdjdjddjdjdjdjdjdjdjdj\n\n\n\n⚫️⚫️System Shutting down⚫️⚫️\n\n🔴🔴🔴Memories overload🔴🔴🔴
I STILL LOVE THIS SONG! FREAKING LOVE MILEY CYRUS!
THIS SONG WAS STUCK IN MY HEAD A FEW DAYS AGO IM LIVINGGGGG
Miley seems like such a genuinely beautiful person, inside and out
PRE ORDER ''''YOUNGER NOW'''' ON ITUNES OR BUY IT IN STORES 29/9. you all wanted 'old miley' back so now give her your coins please. thanks.
She's just trying to go back to the old Miley so that people can forget about the hoe Miley. Sorry but it's on tape, it will never be forgotten. Just like you said Miley people will always remember you as The Naked Girl Swinging From The Wrecking Ball
Your legacy is here Mileyyy! We were waiting for this day
OMG my Fave HM song. This was the jam
At first I thought that Josh Peck was on her shirt
Oh this isn't the one from wiz Kalifa
Miley is my City
Donate to save the tiger http://www.savetigersnow.org/ in a decade tigers will be extinct unless we act now

THIS SONG IS MY CHILDHOOD IM DYING RN
THE NOSTALGIA
What kind of schools do u guys go too! Never had these problems haha
I'm only 14 and so many of these remind me of primary school it's actually ridiculous 😂
We had to get changed in the classroom in primary and I even thought it was weird when I was a child
I'm still in school now and it's the exact same
Most of the stuff on here are still in most the schools I have been to.
I'm at school now and I can relate to nearly all of these problems😂most of these were focused on primary school tho
There literally the same now aha
I'm doing homework 😂😂😂
4:20 me 😂
Still the same tbh
Ohh my god this is soooo relatable!!!
59k and trending????
Literally my life.
I actually am watching this instead of writing an essay.
This was the most realatable thing I have ever watched
I'm in year 11 and that is the exact same as my primary and secondary school
we used to get changed in the classroom too!!
P.E. Lessons are the same you just get given one of those fuck off hard ass blue mats to DO forward FUCKING rolls on 😂😂
I just relived my childhood in a video 😂 and tbh schools haven't changed that much since 😂
Yes my school was very similar. I guess that was just the way it was in the UK the past decades...
i'm in year 11 and that's still literallyy my school to the tee
Am I the only one that likes moremarcus better than the main channel
I had to change in the classroom for PE  up until year six. We had a changing room and all, just didn't use it for some reason.
I'm 14 and we still have all of that crap haha.
I'm in year 10 now and can confirm that school's are still exactly the same as this
School is the exact same now. Well mine is at least
Exactly like my high school which has now been knocked down and houses are now there
My school looks like hog warts it was built in 1677 but it's just a normal school, not a private school
This is literally primary school and I'm only 15 now
We had to change for p.e in the classroom  up until year 6
,y school is very so al
School is shit still lol
had to change like that in the classroom up until year 6 it was so awkward😂
Lol I'm 14 and the only thing that wasn't the same as yours was we have smart boards. We also got changed in classrooms until year 4 and then girls got changed in the cloakroom and boys in the classroom, so yeah primary school was shit😂
These things were only in my primary school, secondary school was much better
No in my old primary school which was 3 years ago exactly the same but now just in the small space of time everything has changed
The most relatable thing i have actually ever seen
I'm 13 and the majority of these things remind me of primary school so much 😂
We had to do changed in class room
Literally both my primary and secondary school. So funny looking back at it now 😂
Really wanna know what school Marcus went to
Schools are literally still like this
I'm in yr 7 I RELATE SO FUCKING MUCH
Is it just my school that lets you got out for lunch? Also in my primary everyone has to change together till like P6/Year 6  thinking about it now it's so weird😂
Im quite lucky i went to a good achool
Most of these things still happen now!!
I can relate to everything, my primary had everything on this list!! And I'm only in S4 (Year 11)
We used to throw wet paper towels at the windows or if the windows where open we would aim for the younger kids hahah
In my primary school all the boys and girls were in the same classroom getting dressed until the end of year 6😂😂There was no changing rooms😂😂
im 16 and i went to primary school from 2005- 2012 and then secondary school from 2012-2017 and my schools was exactly the same as this so things cant of changed that much cuz i could relate to every single thing on that list.
I moved to England and started year 10 here. My school was made last year and it's really good
These all still apply to school now lol
I'm watching this instead of homework
I'm in year 10 now bad this is sooooooo relatable 😂🙄
That first school is my school
its sad i'm only 15 and i can relate to all of these :D
i got changed in my classroom until year 5 - the girls hated it!
I'm watching this instead of homework 😂😂
So many reminded me of my primary school not even kidding
marcus, school in your day and school now are literally exactly the same.\n\nit's still shit
I was so nervous to watch this because of how much I used to dread school. 😥\nAnd Up to year 5 boys and girls changed together in the classroom 😵😳
At your big age you still making school vids run out of content then 🤷‍♀️
I actually am meant to be doing homework 😂😂
When I was in primary, I had to get changed in the class in front of everyone till year 6😩
when we went to the computer rooms to do mymaths but we didnt actually do anything😂
Its sad to see great youtube legends channel dying..but people like the Pauls Rise ..Smh
Number 43 on trending like how????
My school did the exact same with the whole 'new science block' but it's going to take so long that you're not actually going to see it and get any use from it🤔
Up here in Scotland, we interchanged in the classroom too! From P1 right through to P7. We would all get changed in the classroom at the same time until P4 or P5, when the rule then became the boys or girls would change first while the others waited outside the room, then switch.
so most of these are exactly my school but for the changing room..... till year 4 we all got changed in our class and then in yr 6 we done the same thing only that girls went it another classroom to get changed... cause years are split into 2 boys were in one to change and the girls in another. I'm currently in year 9 and since year 7 all boys get changed in the pic you showed xD
Jesus that reminds me of when I was at school
I ticked everything 😂
He went to shoreham college, that’s my one lol
I'm 13 and my school practically has all of these!!
We go swimming and all get changed in the same room
Marcus I swear your old school is like mine now 😂 It is that 60's brick building and it is getting knocked down soon to be remade into a more modern school, but the younger years are like You'll miss out on seeing the new school building, you'll be out of school when it's been built! 😂
School Is pretty much exactly the same now
3:36 the textbook says 1D AF whoever wrote that. Same
My school is still like that now 😂
its the same now ahah
seriously schools are no different now
The TV thing we used to get in year 2 in Italy lol
i'm in year 10 and literally all of these are relatable
School has not changed. Not. One. Bit.
I'm crying he thinks school is better now lmao dw I'm in 8th grade and I relate to like 99% of this video
no my school is so old there is nothing remotely modern in it at all. some classrooms still have black boards 💀\nBUT IT IS A GREAT SCHOOL AND I LOVE
Omg I'm 12 nearly 13 and most of them were literally my school 😂
2017 and my school is exactly the same 😩
The year 4 changing thing is true 😂
We still have all that crap now, blue mats and everything hahaha
i go to an all girl public school rated 5th best in the country and it's still as shit as the one down the road😂
it is not that different even now
Literally just had to go through all of this
I'm 15 and 98% of that was my primary school and now my secondary
i was legit rocking on my chair exactly when he mentioned it
I'm still in school now and I can relate to most of these. Idk whether it's because I'm Australian and we still haven't 'caught up' yet but 🤷🏻‍♀️
Some of these are relatable even for Australia in the 90s & 00s
my high school opened in 1871 and we only had those radiator heaters which only were turned on during the winter and then turned off after lunch it was absolotely freezing
That may have been your school but that was my primary lol relatable
In my primary skl we changed in the classroom till yr 6 and now in secondary we have 2mins to shower?!??!?!?
Underrated af

LYRICS:\n\nMmm, yeah, yeah\nI carried you slow for way too long\nI couldn't let you go, under a spell of don't don't don't\nEgo reaction\nGuess I was holding up face\nBy saving your ass\nYou spent my money and I lost their faith\n\nI screamed yes, you told me nah\nYou fed me fear, I spoke to God\nI was living my dreams through your eyes\nBuilding my life on your lies, yeah\nYou just laughed when I cried\n\nThink about that\nWho knew the real sacrifice\nThink about that\nThink about that\nThink about\nThink about that, wow\n\nAll you disturb is my work and my patience\nYears of grinding, you took it, you broke it\nAll cause you're faking\nYou wanna be famous\nSay it, you wanna be famous\nUsing my jewels\nYou were thirsty as fuck\nAlways late, always faded\n\nI scream yes, you told me nah\nYou fed me fear, I spoke to God\nI was living my dreams through your eyes\nBuilding my life on your lies, yeah\nYou just laughed when I cried\n\nThink about that\nWho knew the real sacrifice\nThink about that\nThink about that\nThink about\nThink about that\nThink about that\n\nThink about that\nThink about that time when you blamed me\nThink about that time when I called you up\nAnd I said I needed saving\nThink about that time when you said you cared\nYou were lying, tryna faze me\nThink about that time when I got sick\nAnd you made me go on stage\nThink about that time when you used my fame\nTo stack up on your paper\nThink about that time you told my label, as you said, She's crazy\nThink about the fact they see it now\nYou're a shark, a cheat, a traitor (shark, a cheat, a traitor)\n\nThink about that\nThink about that\nThink about\nThink about that\nThink about that\nThink about that\nYeah, think about that
It's about  ta go down!!!

ayyyyy lets go! she on a new vibe, love it
why is jessie such a bad ass
Who is she singing about?
The queen has blessed us all. I am so excited for this album
damn, what did Luke James do?????
I Wonder who's Jessie is talkin bout?😳
Who said she crazy 😬😬😬\nShe slaying more like it  😎😎😎
She needs to collab with Jack Garratt.
Why she is almost naked.... I am here because of her voice, her lyrics, her personality, because of her!
This just made my day !!! On repeat ❤️❤️🔥🔥
I was worried about her
The video of your butt doesn't seem to go with song? Think about that
I loved the content,but why nudity is used in your video ...I really love u jessi that's why am disturbed
Beautiful 😍\nBtw this reminds me of Christina Aguileras Stripped album... Masterpiece❤️
Jessie J is Back and She Is Slaying our lifes
I can't even remember how many times I have watched this
Is this about Luke James?👀
She can play with me 😂💋
How interesting.  I first discovered Jessie before she had a record deal and I thought she was a real talent.  I didn't really care for where she went with it in America.  It just seemed so targeted at getting 'hits' and after it succeeded once, it just felt inauthentic and desperate.  I still liked a lot of the songs in that bland pop kind of way, but I questioned whether the special quality I thought was there really was.  So this new stuff is refreshing.  It sure doesn't sound like everything else out there at the moment.  It might take a bit for me to get used to, but I sense that perhaps this is an 'album' in the true sense.  Good for her for finding her path again.
Great sound. Catchy as hell. She's looking fierce. This track will make a banging remix! Can't wait! 😍
so grateful i am alive at the same time as jessie j LIVING LEGEND
there's so much pain in this...what the hell happened to her? it's such a good song but my heart...I love you jessie. I'm new and I don't know you or your sound well but I love your honesty and don't give a fuck-ness. so do you and don't let no one tell you diff. take good care of yourself and your heart, girl. we will always love you. I'm a kpopper. this is how we encourage: Jessie J Fighting!
Why you look like a whore?
I get it. I like it. I wont say it though. I dunno about fame.
Ooooo wonder who she's talking about
it's back my babe !! 😍 love u
Loving this. The look really suits her and you can tell she means business. What a strong woman!
At the West-2017 exercises, the Russian Ka-52 Alligator helicopter opened fire on viewers\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8fTKJoQvPM
Its about time that jessie showed her ass and rubbed her clit.
Don't sleep on this sistah, her ass can blow!
OMGGGGGGGGG, ON REPEAT, LOVE THIS SONG. JESS YOU SLAAAAAY <3

Cheryl got the fame instead Nadine 😖
Maravilhosa, ficou espetacular ❤
So talented
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😘 Nadine queen 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🤗
I can hear this song in G-A-Y
Aw great, another piece of manufactured crap that sounds like every other song on the radio. It's already flopped
I like the song. But I dont understand why she couldn't change outfits and do a dance routine. People love to watch Cheryl dance and wear all these cute clothes which makes them buy the music despite her voice which is lacking. Cheryl's videos have lots of beautiful sexy shots of her which keeps ppl coming back for more. I love Nadine but I'm afraid she's about to make the same mistake. How can you make such an infectious tune and not dance. Beware Nadine, people will get bored.
she's been out the music scene so long she's vertically forgotten
I met her she thinks she's so famous I was working at a store and she walked in with her child and she gave this golden credit card thing that said her name😂
She is stunning but the video and song is shockly bad. I hope she is more picky going forward as she is capable of smashing out no1 records
It's an enjoyable video but I feel like this really needed a dance routine! Love the song though.
I don't know why but this song reminds me of Daft Punk - Get Lucky
I always was mesmerized by her in girls aloud, but it was due to her looks. I thought girls aloud we're known for lip syncing. I don't know if this is her honest voice, but the lyrics is kind of terrible especially for someone who wants to break out, so to speak.
Awful music but she is stunning.
love it but I can't with her trying to move her eyebrows every time even though her face is so full of botox lmao
in 2007 it could be #1 hit
What a flop sorry
Theme tune for Jeremy Kyle lol
Why dont you stop singing
<3 About damn time!
*THUMBS UP IF YOU THINK THIS LINER CAN DEFEAT VOLDEMORT IN ONE GO, HAH!*
OMG THIS IS REALLY AWESOME I'M SO SHOOKT😍😍😍💓

Look at you go sexy girl woooo
I'm screaming at the fact that you did a buzzfeed quiz when THERES AN OFFICIAL SORTING HAT QUIZ BY JK ROWLING HERSELF AAAHHHHHH
I think she looks very beautiful without her makeup
You took the wrong quiz!! That's not the actual quiz!!
Nooo. You're supposed to take the Pottermore sorting quiz 😭
I'm not one I thought I was one but I'm a ravenclaw
You should have done the Pottermore quiz. Jk Rowling created that one. I'm slyther in
You make it looks so easy hahaha, it's just amazing 😍😍
All my Hufflepuff give Nikkei a like 😂

I am sorry for all of the Harry Potter👦👓⚡📙 loveers but I have no idea what she is talking about
Super cool! Love the look Nikkie it's stunning! Especially the wing lol! Absolutely beautiful!! :)
I know this was just for fun but I am OFFENDED that you took a damn buzzfeed quiz instead of going to the Pottermore website. I'm disappointed! This look is still beautiful though, as always.
Omg I love you Nikkie❤️!!!!! Her looks are just so different and unique and it's so amazing to see how much you can really do with makeup. I love that this shows that makeup isn't just to look nice for everyday wear but art too!!
You should have gone on pottermore so J.K Rowling's website could have matched you, not buzzfeed.
NO YOU GET SORTED ON POTTERMORE NO THIS IS SO WRONG 😭😭😭
I'm a ravenclaw, definitely not disappointed, being that, that's my favorite house 😍❤ I love you Nikkie! Slay this look girl!!

Genuinely takes a true artist to create that look oml!!!

Where can I get similar band? It's gorgeous!
You add things to your face because tiu are insecure
Does anyone know if those brushes are any good?
I can't stop wondering if those brushes were wands or broomsticks.. the brush has me thrown 🤓
Hellooooo I'm waiting on the Fenty video !!!! Lol BTW I lovees this video and I have been dying to buy that palette !!!!
Her eyebrows are pure form of perfection... So damn pretty! She is so talented. Love her vids😙
You can't choose ur own wand core, the wand chooses the wizard Nikki!!!
Watch how I made my eyes look bigger 😍😍 the video is on my channel
Nikki is the only beauty guru ik to have gotten lip injections and not looked like a fool with flappy duck lips they make her lips look so full and beautiful.
You shouldve taken the test from pottermore! But I'm a gryffindor and I love the eye look :)
PLEASE Nikki make all Harry Potter looks! I'm a big Harry Potter fan and i adore you and your talent 😘
I'm pretty sure that the pop luxe glows in the dark without the black Light, you just have to charge it in a light and it'll glow for about 10 mins. They're so pretty, I love all Nadi's highlights look!
You should review the PopLuxe Night Life highlighter! You do NOT need a blacklight. It really glows in the dark!
damn your such a good makeup artist!!! YOUR A GODDESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS<3
Can you please show us this green highlighter in blacklight? It sounds amazing!!!!!!!!! :)
I'm getting very Hunger Games vibes from this look.  I live, die, breathe

I LOVE HUGE HAIR BOWS. Also I'm a Hufflepuff ☺️
I need all the Disney stuff 😍
I'm in Ravenclaw! I also have that sparkly scarf ;D
I have queens ears and it's a nightmare! I JUST WANT TO WEAR PRIMARK EARRING 😭😭
Is there an American equivalent to Primark?
Fashion - not great at the moment. I agree about the 40s and 50s though. I have bought a TON of Lindy Bop dresses. They just keep having sales and I keep buying them because I can't pass up on such a bargain. (I'm a Ravenclaw)
Lovin the hair 🔥 Where are my Ravenclaws @ ? 💙
What product are you wearing as your contour/bronzer? So pretty 😍
Hufflepuff here. I get clothes from modcloth because they have a lot of the 50's inspired fit and flare dresses that fit my pear shaped body (and that I've always found lovely.)
I am a ravenclaw
I was thinking the same thing the other day about bows. Came to the same conclusions...lol...just turned 31. Gryffindor!
I'm also sick of 90s fashion, just not a fan of the loud colors
I want 50's fashion, maybe some 70's. I quite like the 70's sleeves that are puffy. New look is okay at the moment but I went to primark and there was just nothing that I liked!
I loooooveee the fashion at the moment!!! A few years ago I felt the same as you, with the skaterskirt thight highwasted shorts and croptops. Just wasn't my style. This year I looovvee it!!
I'm a hufflepuff
I bought that candle for my kids teachers leaving gift along with a few goodies. And I had to buy a few for myself. I am also a candle snob! So was shocked at those too. Xxx
I love your sense of humour 👌🏼😂
I just got to the UK for study abroad and now these primark hauls are dangerous. Must not buy tons of cute things I can't bring home.
I want everything that has Beauty and the Beast related stuff on it - I.e. Chip! I love it 😍😍
Never clicked so fast!!!😂💗💗💗💗,I LOVE U LOUISEE💗💗
I am in hufflepuff house
Also hating fashion lately, it seems everything is designed for women who are size 6 and love slogans :/ the best clothes currently are unfortunately the more expensive such as french connection etc. Because high street fashion isn't too forgiving right now!
Louise your make up looks fab. Slay girl! Xx
I don't think I told you this nor have you ever noticed me but I am super proud of you. This was random but meh.
I'm a Ravenclaw, I don't like frozen either! I'd like 1950's/1960's fashion to return.
I don´t like fashion at the moment. I don´t even get excited about shopping anymore. I can´t seem to find anything I like when I go in a store. I really love classy and more elegant clothing, which is totally not practical when working with kids though
I know how you feel when I was pregnant I was wearing Jeggings and vest tops
I really like 90s fashion! Apart from crop tops, I don't see the point of them and who wants to walk around with their belly out?! Love the pink hair by the way!
The best thing I found in primark recently was. Floral Pom Pom throw and also bows like jo jo bows and also a cream hat with multi coloured Pom Pom on it and mojito lip balm and I want the Christmas baubble
I seem to be living out of shops like dotty p's and white stuff because they have less 90s stuff. I need things that don't make me look like a boob/stomach blob!!!
Being a curvy girl, I can not STAND the nineties fashion at the moment. It would seem if you have boobs and a bum there isn't a lot of choice. Maybe I am not looking hard enough, but I do think the nineties clothes should stay in the nineties! P.S I love you.
Hufflepuff all the way <3 So proud to be a Hufflepuff tbh.. I kinda love the fashion of the mo actually. loving the mom jeans vibe and crop tops and such. I do really need to get my get my tummy a bit more into shape to feel 100% confident in them again in summer. I think I actually own more crop tops than regular tops..... love you so much!
I got so excited for the Disney things and the Harry Potter things that I nearly threw up, amazing video. Love it!!!
Slytherin is in the comment!!!!
I like your hair but I think you should not dye your hair when your preggo
Love your hair! I'm a hufflepuff.\nAlso today's fashion doesn't suit me either and I much prefer dresses. I shop online at places like Thunder egg, minimum mouse or Lindy bop. I would love to see you do a 40/50's style look book or haul too!
I like the fashion but I don't want to wear it because everyone else is wearing it and I like to look a tad unique <3
I quit like the stripes
Not a big fan of the 90's fashion myself. Totally agree how it just doesn't suit my body shape. Not sure which I would pick but I vote we veto the 90's malarkey
Yes for bows and pink hair!
Louise, you and I are of similar age, so we remember the 90's fashion the first time it was around... haha! I'm not slim either so none of it really suits my body. I'd also like the 1950's to come back because I'd love an excuse to wear a poodle skirt without people thinking I've got on a costume.
I love, love, love that you call Darcy Doodles. That is what I called my youngest too!!!
love all the lighting with copper very nice and love long cardigans....
I got the pink lemonade candle for my birthday and omfg it smells like strawberry Bon-bons
I'm struggling wirh this fashion has a curvier woman .\nI'm obsessed wirh mugs and I'm in love with my bambi mug from primark .\nI love the copper lighting .x
😱 jimmy got that cactus thing too!\nI'm a Hufflepuff! 💛
Love your Primark hauls best, I've missed them.
I don't dress in a very feminine way so I can't comment on the women's clothes very much, but I like the men's 90s fashion and the more neutral trends. I don't like the high waist thing very much coz I'm a tall girl and nothing reaches my waist without giving me a wedgie. I kinda prefer the more grungy androgynous style than whats going on right now
1) Hair is beaut 2) best thing from primark recently(ish) was a set of those acrylic makeup drawers everyone was going batshit over, but for like £4 3) I totally get what you mean about the fashion thing, it's all 90s-baggy or frills-and-flounces-and-puffy-bits that just look odd on a lot of people. I snapped a pic the other day in a store of a top that looked like the classic grandma's-lace curtains next to a skirt made of classic grandma's-old-sofa material. Because obviously looking like a 1970s living room is the next big thing. But at least in autumn we can be guaranteed ankle boots and jumpers, and that's good enough for me!
Absolutely loving the Harry Potter collection in Primark!!!! Deffos heading out for the Christmas baubles!! Gryfindor ♥ 💛
Love the bow and the bauble ps i'm a ravenclaw
Gryffijgdor for days also i need that Hogwarts bauble in my life my mum and I are going to have to go on a prikark spree soon lol
A huffle myself and with you on 1950s - I can't stand most of what's in at the moment?! I don't wanna wear something with that much flesh out thank you very much ;)
Hi \nHow fab you think of your friends when shopping xx
Ravenclaw for me!! Love the hair xx
It's not normal how much I loved this video. You're brilliant 💖
Have you thought about bringing out a maternity range with a figure very similar to you I find it so hard 💕💕💕
This makes me wanna go to primark so bad. Like... right now. OMG
Im a Ravenclaw! I love you and I hope you have great day!
Ahhh so gutted I missed you! I work right next to Rushden lakes near the Waitrose! Hopefully one day I'll run into you 😃🙉 x
I wonder if emma saw the presents 🤔🤔
Love this weeks upload Louise! Possibly video idea...sprinkle of glitter tries Pinterest crafts? Maybe not glitter pumpkins like last year....still one of my favourite videos to watch ever. Happy to see you happy and your little family grow xx
Gryffindor but i was a hatstall for slytherin
Those HP baubles/ornaments are so cute! I'm a Hufflepuff! :) As for fashion, I have no idea what's in right now. I just wear what I like and feel comfortable in. Skinny jeans, band tee, flannel, a leather or jean jacket and converse or Vans or combat boots. Haha.
Primary is legit my second home these days😂
that is a very nice haul
40s or 50s fashion for me xo
I live 2 mins away from rushden lakes!!!!
I got so exited because your pink again 😆😆😆😆
I don't want any fashion to come back. I think we should set our own!
I'm a slytherin 😂🙌🏼🙌🏼
I'm 9 months pregnant... what is this fashion you speak of??
Currently off school sick and watching you to feel better :)
You should totally do a video where you take the sorting, wand and patronus quizzes on Pottermore! and btw your hair looks flippin beautiful!
Fashion us horrendous right now for Curvy girls. Bloody nightmare finding anything nice!
Wahhhh you live near Rushden Lakes?! Me too. What do you think? xx
I want all those beauty and the beast things. I wish we had them in Australia!
Do you think your love language is gifts? I do the same going overboard getting things for friends I think they will like.
Fashion is shit at the moment, I'm 30 and no I don't want to wear crop tops, string bras and stupid ripped see through things, I want real clothes! Men section has appropriate attire why does the women's not? 🙄 xxx
slytherin btw x
Ravenclaw!!!!
Your hair is incredible!!

For all you you negative fake fans, fuck off!!!! In Klopp i trust and future looks good. KEEP THE SPIRIT HIGH. YNWA SWEDEN
Calm the fuck down you bunch of infantile imbeciles. Klopp's got at least 5 more years to build a team. We haven't got money on the scale of you-know-whos nor the type of manager who needs endless amounts of cash to buy, sell and buy again, top quality players. Klopp will bring us success in his own way and time. Have some patience and take it on the chin. I know some of you crave bragging rights cause your mate's are laughing at you and your shit team. Man up ffs!
be angry all you want but atleast find a good enough reason to be. People slating the defence: apart from the defensive error the defense delt brilliantly with all that Burnley offered, robbos positioning was exceptional.\nPeople slating the attack: You have the right to criticize the forwards for not linking up as well as they could have but ultimately we did make enough chances and apart from the final pass we looked to break them down. Keep in mind that this lot kept out Chelsea and spurs as well, but every draw or negative result is takn in a generalised manner by Liverpool fans.\nWe had a plan, they had a plan, they executed theirs better than we did ours, but we also got unlucky. I take positives from the fact we have the elememnts now with coutinho playing deep to open up smaller teams, ultimately when this particular lineup of players gels together I can see us doing bits. We've already seen our counter attacking lineup, with gini can and hendo tear it up.
The German Brendan Rodgers.
klopp is a world class manager ...to any fan commenting otherwize you're not a real fan ...if you can't support us when we draw or loose then you're not a true fan ...!!
Man Im starting to get sick and tired of these so-called fans posting their bullshit online, the LFC Facebook page is full of fucking idiots trashing the team and now this comment section is getting worse, if you are a Liverpool fan then get behind the team, if not then fuck off. #COYR #YNWA #LIVERPOOLFOREVER
I was a Liverpool fan before most of the people in this comment section were born. But you know what, I agree with them. Klopp is a moron, he's blinded by his own ego and never admits to any of his mistakes. Also, he's stubborn, the reason we dont have any new center backs is because it's an admission of fault from his part if he buys one. Remember, all last season he said we have a great defence and that we don't need new players. So he does't want to go back on his statement. That's how stubborn and dumb he is. This team won't win anything, mark my words. I hope Klopp gets fired before the January window, so we can get a proper defence in place.
Wow, i didn't know how toxic the liverpool fan base is! You're not real fans, please accept, klopp deserves better than you people.
We are liverpool... our manager will do right by the club. Not signing for sake of signing. He is building a tean not buying a team like other clubs .

One man team - no Mane no win.
Win/lose/draw...players get paid the same wage, dock em and you'll see improvements and the chaff will be separated and sold for peanuts to Arsenal
Remember when we had Coates Enrique Borini and Lambert?😭 it's not crisis mode yet stick together
Should have signed a CB
Everyone needs to calm the fuck down. Fans are so emotional and fickle. two weeks ago after the arsenal game everyone was on top of the world. now, two draws and a loss and it's like we need to support the team in times like these comments. yes, our defense is shit but it's early days. A couple wins and we are back in the race and it's group stage in the CL, all with 1 pt. everyone fukn relax.
Get the results & talk less, Old Bob just get the results to do his talking!!!!!

I agree the defence is shocking and we need to sort it out. But we don't need to sack him, give him some time. I understand he has been manager for a while now but let's not be a Chelsea or man city. Let the manager do his job. If we sack him,  who do we get in?. There is nobody so let's get behind the team.
Wait until we get Keita we will never concede. \n\nKlopp is doing the right Thing, fair enough we didn't get a cb in the window but what u gotta remember: \nMane: Sent off\nLallana: Injured\nClyne: Injured\nThat's 3 of our main starters out and yes we did basically have our main team out but lovren wasn't in it, and the three people I mentioned I believe could change the team easily. And for all the fake fans who are complaining are not true fans. Like if ur a true fan. #YNWA
Fraud get out of our club #ynwa
We drew a game against a team that have had results against Chelsea and Spurs. I didn't go the game but I listened to it and watched extended highlights. It very much looked/sounded like we battered them. I'm a little bit bored of the goalkeeper/defence debate. They're all good players, they don't get any protection from the midfield, as the midfield are intent on marauding forward. It will get tweaked and we will put together a decent run of results. All the haters need to 'calm down'.
5-0 drubbing from city, 1-1 against Burnley at Anfield..\n\nPeople are upset because early on, we haven't seen any improvement from last season (so far) people are angry, and no one has a right to say that you can't get angry as a fan, it's like saying you can't be a human being and support Liverpool. Shut the fuck up. \n\nME personally, I trust in Klopp, and he is getting a rude lesson in the premier league at the moment, and it's in these times managers learn, and become better. \n\nI'm patient, but don't say to someone they're not a fan because they're pissed off, not everyone is going to rationalise things in the same way. We go again.
Mashraf Brownie well said buddy...Klopp was the best thing that has happened to this club in years...now you want him gone😂😂😂 you fuck tards😭 HE HAS MY BACKING, HES MY MANAGER YOU FUCKERS
Actually ,this time we didn't draw because of the defence.We lost point today because we missed too many easy chances
Football is for nerds.\n\nPlay League of Legends scrubs
Klopp is a one trick pony and never seems to learn from his mistakesThis defence are leauge of lreland standard,,,,,no offence to leauge of lreland
has he won a trophy at Liverpool yet?
Excuses galore. There is always   if ,but , only . JK is a great guy but not a great manager. We now sit 5 points off the top and the season as really only just started. I fear the winter as we get injuries, suspensions and involved in more and more competitions. Until we can go to places like Watford and win 6   0 then we will always be average . If we do not buy at least 4/5 decent players inc a goalkeeper then we will be out of all competitions by March . I have no doubt we will field a weak team in Jan for the FA cup and JK only aim will be fourth place for UCL again. Which to me is pointless if you are never going to win it .
disgusting behaviour by the club should have sol phil and bou9ght a striket
we are going on a winless streak till manu game ifwepay like thid
he needs to make subs earlier
To all the Liverpool fans getting irritated about negative comments. This is what Arsenal fans go through every year from 2003.
All this klopp hate is ridiculous. Sure the defence is leaky there's no denying that. But he has assembled one of the best attacking squads in Europe. Period. People are too impatient. 2 seasons in charge and he's brought us to to Europa final and within the top 4. Rodgers had his one off season which brought us close to the English title and before him was the epic champions league title in 06. Rome wasn't built in a day and quite frankly even if we aren't a title contender this season we play one of the best football on our best day (which honestly aren't far between each other). I have faith in klopp and our squad and I have faith he will continue to build and assemble a title winning team. And a question to all the klopp haters: what manager are you guys praying for that is available to just come and suddenly win titles?  Klopp and the reds knows there's an army of faithful who will always walk with you #ynwa
Patience is the key for success. LFC fans please give time to this guy. Because in dortmund he had time and independent to take decisions and another main reason was at that time, no other club had so much money to buy ready made players. For eg see Burnley they are happy with one point also because they have no money and fully support their manager. They think whatever he do is good for Burnley. When they where religated he was the manager and now also he is the manager.we have to learn from Burnley,because this guy  is much better than plastic managers like jose and pep.
Always a lot of talks... bla bla bla... and after dramatic disaster with City there is a worse match against Burnley. All team puts effort to attack, to support Salah but they don't arrive much goals...and, on the other hand, defense is too much under pressure collapsing first or later!  SALAH left Chelsea and Chelsea started to win again.!  Klopp & Flopp a strong disaster.!😂😂😂😂😂
Klopp \n\nPro's\n\nExciting attacking football\nPotential to smack sides of all abilties\nMotivating\n\nCon's\n\nDefending transition, since the fullbacks get really high up the park as he attacks in numbers\nEgo and stubborn i.e. won't add an extra defender to defend a lead.

a lot of weekend/game day managers in here that think klopp doesn't have the defense sorted and think he's naive/arrogant to the quality of the back performances. hard to think you can't comprehend that he probably wanted to buy specific defenders, and had x,y,z plans and adjustments for defense. the reality of the deals not being closed in the window (not in his control) means he has no choice but to show positive reenforcement in the belief and work rate of the players he has to work with. on the pitch for game day or in the training grounds and at the end of the day—it's always the players, not the manager. if he doesn't (in the public eye) show that he at least believes in the system and their ability to play in it—then the players wouldn't give any shit either.
Aaaaargh! Tough pill to swallow, that. Wasteful again in front on goal. Feels like 2 points dropped. Disappointing. Although, that's not to say that Salah's goal was amazing! He was probably the best player on the pitch in red today. Again, he looked dangerous, and £34 million now looks like a steal. Solanke looked good when he came off. Phil Coutinho also looked dedicated. Defensive frailties again costing us, same old Liverpool! Let's try and be more ruthless next time. \nC'mon Liverpool! We go again against Leicester City at the King Power Stadium on Tuesday night in the League Cup. C'mon Redmen! #YNWA ⚽️🔴❤️
Fucking idiot turning into Wenger! Play Gomes centre back! play two defensive midfielders or even play 5 at the ffs 😂 find a fucking solution! Dropping and replacing klavan and lovren with each other is a fucking waste
Win lose or draw it's Liverpool forever. We are going trough a bad patch now but it will get better all clubs do at some point in the season it's better for us to get it over with early. We will get new players in January and finish the season strong. Jurgen knows what he is doing we just have to have faith in him and give more time. He is the best manager we have had in a long time.
When ur winning ur happiest fans in england but soon as u lose or draw u never stop fucking moaning stfu u shit fans UTC🔴🔵🔴🔵
Disappointed with all the negative comments.. we have to keep encouraging and supporting him and the team no matter what! #YNWA
Flopp is changing the team so often he is destroying the team not building it. Players have bad moral. Not to mention lack of tactic, players are running like zombies with no apparent plan. he is wearing them down. He plays players out of position, does not use ones he has, delays changes, did I say he does not study the different teams we play. He probably tell the players come on boyz go there do your thing, and thats the plan de jour and every jour
I hate what we are right now and I won't excuse anything, that being said I won't stop supporting both manager and players. If you think different then you should check your self\nKlopp is a world class manager who has access to world class coaches, our owners seem a bit tight in terms of net spend but we have improved. I am not satisfied, I complain but I do not wish Klopp out as that would be stupid.
The best manager in the world!!! Our klopp!!
Created enough chances? We had 2-3 real good ones, one of them leading to the goal. That's pathetic if you have 150% ball possession. Klopp needs to take a cold shower.
Stick together still early days
This guy never has any fucking answers for anything on or off the pitch. What a pathetic excuse for a manager.
Im a Liverpool fan but this is so true:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttack wins you games,defence wins you titles.   Btw im not Klopp out.Im defence out new defence in (especially cb's)
theirs only 2 reasons we didnt improve the defence Klopp or the owners.We had a supposed £2000million to spend ,and we spent at the most £50 million at the least £30million after selling players.Something is definitely wrong .Why will no one ask him directly why we didnt improve the defence ,its a joke to every other team and their supporters.I feel embarrassed
If liverpool defenders were more confident in the air  challenge better and were tighter at the back we would not concede as many goals.
All WHO says klopp out Are fake fans
First time i am a doubting this man, its the same old shite. This season was supposed to be different, in reality very much the same. Obviously is a brilliant manager, but teams have figured us out and he has no answer to this. I can only hope he will soon.
Solanke  must start next match ,he's more proactive in attack than Than Firmino.
If you are #KloppOut then you're simply plastic and deluded.
I’m sorry the back 4 is apauling I don’t know what to say. It’s bs, Why don’t we put Moreno LW?? Everyone moans about him playing to high when he’s in LB why don’t we try him LW whilst Mane is out, push firmino back to his no. 9 role. It’s hopeless,  Klopp said ‘there was no CenterBacks on offer’ De Virj from Lazio, Koulibaly, anyone but Klavan and Lovren. I feel sorry for Matip for what he has to play with. Come on guys it’s not hard. If u take in the fans opinions and ideas maybe just maybe we might do something. Ideally I don’t wanna see Klopp go But I DO wanna see changes. It’s BS!!! COYR // YNWA
so many negative comments and klopp out screamers. i understand that but people are angry about those point losses over and over but i also think you need to realize that liverpool haven't been an elite team for many years now. yes they need to address defense but its easier said than done. the marked for middle inns is such small and once anyone on high skill level hits the market you compete with lots of top clubs. even city had huge probs to find defenders. and what i want to add cause of all this negativity after the sevilla game - just please don't forget that pool hasn't been real madrid the past 2 years. sevilla won the euro league 3 times in a row. spanish top team since years. and liverpool dominated and could have lead 4-1 at half. plenty of things to improve but its not all that dark
With or without Coutinho LiverJail is still disappointing!\nThey should let him go! Karma is punishing Klop!
As a LFC Fans, I'm extremely disappointed and also very angry seeing this team playing dirty football. Sturridge was not good at all today and he was still on the pitch. Solanke is better and he never plays always on this bloody bench. klopp always use the same plays so it doesn't shock me if small team is beating us. Spending lots of money on good player and they don't even play. Nowadays I'm asking myself if klopp is a great manager or not. In every we can see the same mistake everywhere. \nSubstitution after 75' of play, even if the team is loosing. in 15', the game can't change with only one fresh player. \nKlopp so disappointing to have as LFC manager
I am a diehard Liverpool fan and I have always supported Klopp but to be honest Klopp is stubborn and it costing us a lot. I wonder why he wants so much forwards and midfielders without sorting out the defense, it's not like he didn't know about it all along. I never thought I would be saying this but I don't think Klopp is good enof for Liverpool
After 15mins you could predict how the game is going to end, Klopp is an excellent manager so is Sean Dyche for getting a point out of this game, well done to him, however the focus must be on how Klopp fields his team, in my opinion he should have started the game with solkane and ox, you could see firmino and salah was looking tired. Klopp will win games with this side Gk- Ward , LB -Robertson, CB -Matip, CB Gomez, RB -Alexander, MF -Couthino, Henderson, GIGI, FW- Mane, Daniel, Salah. Subs - Simon, Lovren, Firmino, ox, solanke. Comment your best xi LFC Fans.
Time is ticking now on this manager, his choices in the transfer windows are turning out to be woeful. Any defensive coaches work at Melwood?
Disappointed but we need to keep going and believe in Klopp. thought we were could have been more clinical and credit to Burnley they were very disciplined. YNWA
Wtf was that!?I'm sick of this shit.Klopp with a hard heart I'm telling you man...you are wasteing everybody's time.The bad news is that you could do more but you are like all germans...stubborn,in everything good or bad.After 2 years you only have 4 players Mane Matip Salah and Wijnaldum and Milner mostly on the bench so doesn't count.Taday was bad luck but we could easyly lose.Poor plan for first 11,no plan B and nothing  good in the future only a 6th place maybe.
These Klopp out comments aren't Liverpool fans. You see the same exact guys on other videos declaring themselves as Manc fans. Don't fall for it, jeez.
rome wasn't built in a day. he inherited lovern, Henderson and  Firminio what do you expect lol\n\nbe patient
Fuck you kloop we are sick an tired off your fucking hope  gooooooooooo
I haven't been critical of Klopp but I have been noticing he is not really good at game management. The times at which he makes substitutions always baffles me. I think he is too much of a patient person overall. The substitutions are sometimes too late in the game to have an impact and why the hell didn't OX start out wide over Firmino he needs rest anyways smh
Be patient , good game judge him after this month
trent can't cross klavan can't head pass nor has the confidence to drive the ball and force the issue everyone was way to stagnant and standing around at times all that being said this is my elf cup XI ward trent klavan lovren moreno- gini hendo ox-solanke coutinho firminho coutinho needs to play more forward until mane comes back
lets see what excuses KLOOP comes up with this time
Lmao Klopp put Liverpool back in the champions league and this the thanks he gets foh
Everybody saying we need a new center back but IMO we also need a proper defensive mid too, even if we buy a good defender we will still make the same mistakes.
Strap in. Could be a long road. \n\nAn Arsenal sympathiser.
I don't know how can you enter the season with klavan, matib, Milner, moreno, lovren, the rest are trash. Does he really thought he's gonna win the league with this trash ass niggas come on man I can see you built the midfield and the front line well done on that but you are not interested in defenders. You need to steal some mourinho tactics. If this midgets on the front line face those tall and strong guys from Manchester believe me this guy is talking about improvements on nothing.
How can you put Klavan after all his bloopers in defense? Klopp are you blind? Stupid? Or corrupt may be players pay you bribe for gaming time?????????
klaven is useles and lovren in defence. kloop needs to put gomez in in central defence
Remember  spurs only managed a draw today. I bet we beat Leicester  next week .
Its your wrong doing\nNot signing defenders and DM. 18 months in and defence is worse. The issue against orgnized teams, do you go and buy a strong striker who can finish and bully defenders? No yiu waste 40 on ox the overrated Ibe\n\nCharisma buy you time. Fans like you, but same stupid mistakes for 18 months! Tick tock Mr deluded one
no mane no party
Lol Liverpool r sponsored by new balance... Fitting!
Love his wig.
Fuck Klavan
Looserpool
Fancy doing a swapsy for Koeman ?
DID WE MISS SADIO MANE TODAY?
To all the people who don't understand how the transfer market panned out , \nKlopp didn't buy an CB because FSG put out a statement without the knowledge of klopp which inhibited klopp to go for his top target . \nNow sure we can bitch and moan we didn't get a plan B, but that plan B ain't giving us a chance to win a title so we've waited 20+ years already , instead of putting all that baggage unfairly on klopp with half a squad that isn't his players, maybe it's worth waiting an extra couple years and for once get top targets instead of settling for plan b ... social media has just given license to too many people who's impatience would've seen shankley sacked in this era... shame
Haha you scrouse shit heads  cant even beat Burnley , Glory glory man United , Glory glory man United :)
HOW CAN LIVERPOOL FANS SUDDENLY TURN THEIR BACK ON THIS GUY ITS ONLY BEEN 5 GAMES REMEMBER BURNLEY BEAT CHELSEA, DREW TOTTENHAM .....STOP BEING PLASTIC FANS OTHERWISE IF KLOPP GOES IT WILL BE FURTHER DISASTER FOR YOU PEOPLE NO BETTER COACH IS AVAILAIBLE
Keita. Mane. Salah. Let the man build a team. Unless you want to sign another Welsh pirlo.
I can name 500 defenders better than fuckin Klavan. Utter utter dogshit!!🐕💩If Klopp can not see what everyone else sees at Anfield today then he's a cunt. His fault for not strengthening at Centre half end of.
Gk- Mignolet\nRb- Clyne\nCb- Matip\nCb- Gomez\nLb- Robertson\nDm- Can\nCm- Lallana\nCm- Coutinho\nRf- Salah\nLf- Mane\nCf- Firmino\n\nPlay this team and we'll win! Just need our injured players back 😢
ASK KLOPP THIS:\n\nJurgen, your title rivals beat you 5 - 0 and then you draw both your next games, one of them to so called inferior opposition...who will Liverpool beat next?\n\nThe world has no clue who we will beat and who we wont beat, can you give us a clue whats going on?
We are in Champion's League.  We have a team that has a chance to do something good.  Klopp is building a good team. He made a mistake not to get a good defender but we need to keep supporting.
Will lfc win a trophy this season ?????   Answer = NO --- fact.
I love Liverpool and support them even when we played shit. But I cannot forgive Klopp for 2 main reasons: \n1) Renewing and extending contracts of our most vulnerable players and those who are not consistent let alone 'world class'. Who are those players? Simon Mingolet and Dejan Lovren got contract extensions during Klopp..baffles me to why it was done.\n2) He had 4 transfer windows..okay let's just say 2 windows  (summer windows) and he did NOT fix the part we were most lacking in..i.e Goalkeeper and Centre Back. We infact sold one CB..the jury is out if Sakho should have returned or not. Fact is we have not improved defensively when it was so obvious. \nAttacking we are v good. No doubt. But you cannot win leagues with leaky defences. Period. He's got till January to fix this in the window or I'm totally going Anti Klopp.
Klopp is very frustrating! I am starting to hate him because he is making my Liverpool FC a dumbass club.
clearly was told to do that. lil scummer like his dad
Like father, like son.
Hope saunders gets pezzled
My respect for billy joe is over
Dirty pikey
That's so disrespectful.
That boy has a future with pitbulls and trailers.
I hope monroe knocks him clean out
Saunders is a clown the whole build up he's been acting like a jerk even his son is following his actions bad role model talented fighter but a turn off it's unnecessary no need to cross the line Main fight is GGG v Canelo
well that's disgusting...
i'd kick that little mofo in the face
This shows what kind of father he is!?
Pleeeeaaassseee end his career Willie. That dude has no class, it was like he told his son to do that. smh wow
Monroe handled himself well. Should have picked the little snot nose up and throw him on the stage! Bad parenting by Saunders.
Wicked lil devil child👺
Horrible little pikey
I wonder where that autistic like behaviour came from? He didn't lick it from a stone.
Terrible head movement from Monroe.
Family of trash, if they didn't have money they deffo would have been living in runned downed council estate
wtf!!! Have to respect Monroe - Humble guy!
Scumbags
I hope saunders gets knocked tf out and his son sees it while crying
That was direct to Bell-End area and could have seriously hurt him! A strike to the Bertie Bassett or Cuthberts is bad enough but directly to the Bell-End area can cause serious damage. Very strange and weird how he smiles after doing it and walks off, meanwhile Billy doesn't seem remotely concerned he just assaulted a man by specifically targeting his Bell-End .
that's a low blow
Props to Willie Monroe Jr for handling it with class.
Tramp making his son do that
I didn't care who won this fight until now.  Hopefully Monroe demolishes this guy.
Pathetic, hopefully he gets KO in first
My grandma has more muscles than the guy on the left. WTF. Is this the fighter or did he jump on stage?
Go back to your caravan scumbags...
Man, I heard their was some major beef talk. But Munroe handled that with class, even munroe couldnt stop laughin. Great sport about it.
It's all for show people.
the wheels on his house go round and round
Al Jolson got beat the feck down!
Right in the shnazz
That was a distraction to pick pocket Willie
Obviously dad told him to or was cool with it seeing as he didn't react at all...
Kill him with fire!!
Background song?
Shocking parenting
This dude has anger issues tf
Prats family
LMAO!! 😂😂😂
justo en la tercer pierna
Good parenting, idiot. Trash stays trash
1 point deducted ....
Billy ya legend
Good parenting right there....
BAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
Pikeys
born loser...
Billy cold
Hahahaha! Nice work junior. :D
LMAO
Willie got punched in his willy!
useless father did nothing....trash
WTF The New Mcgregor ? ? ? ? LOL
Little British brat
Hope Monroe beats him
I hope Billy wins but respect to Willie for not reacting and telling his coach to cool off. Willie seems like a family man.
Protect yourself at all times
Hope Saunders schools him so all of his tin pot haters have an awful weekend.
Lmao 😂
The dad leered over, He told his son to do it I just know it!
that would have knocked Amir Khan out
sure that  Andre Ward isnt his father? SOG - Son of Groinpunch
This is boxing, 2 big grown men, if a man cant take some bad words and and punch from a 7 year old then he's in the wrong sport,
That was one of funniest thing I've seen
Hahaha.Swinging hands at the speed ball.Great skills.
Monroe is a bootch. He's allowed himself to be straight disrespected.  No lion in him.
Lol
Took it well
Look like another brother is about to beat down another Irish man despite being hit with a low-blow! 🤔
Stupid father stupid son
Erm what just happened there ??
Legend
dope
Oh come on people, that was the nuts! Watch billy junior circumnavigate the security. He tries a few times to squeeze through and on the third attempt....bingo! \nThat was great!
Wasn't Kimmy _also_ a blonde??
also, uncle jesses entire family had black hair. mom, dad, cousins, everyone. It's safe to assume that she probably dyed it blond, making the chances of them having three blond girls even statistically higher without a natural blond parent. \n\nI think this is an open and shut case.
This theory immediately falls apart because Joey is annoying af and no one wants to sleep with him.
its a fucking show with cast members that aren't related wtf
12.5% isn't astronomical odds, I have in many video games been crit 3 times in a row by someone with a 25% chance to crit.
Cmon seriously. Lol well guess what, some kids have dad's with dark hair and moms with blonde hair, and they come out blonde. There, That's my theory.
I mean... not necessarily true. Just look at the Ballinger Family. Dark haired dad, light haired mom, all three kids are blonde.
He went down on her in a theater
Well for one thing i call crap because you cannot base what the children will look like solely on the parents because recessive genes exist and for all we know the grand parents could have been blonde with light eyes and so on and so forth back to ancient times. When we see Danny's mom she has blonde hair so for all we know one girl could have inherited his recessive blonde gene and the others their mom's dominant blonde gene. just relying on the physical appearances of the parents is not scientific and very shameful
your mcm thinks this is deep
The mom is also supposed to be Jesse's sister. Jesse is Greek. Have you ever seen a blonde haired blue eyed mid western looking Greek girl with a little brother that has intense Greek features? That show has so many plot holes lol
So your Grandmother put a tv in the basement closet for you?
Blame the casting
Ok the chances of all being blond, which is 12.5% isn't even that slim. You know that it's possible that all of them can be blond. I have a cousin that is blond but her mom and dad have brown hair.
This is just a show the little kids are just actors .  they don't actually find kids that have brown hair just to look like
It's a fucking show I can't believe someone would read that much into it
Marketing and advertising Offer: Free of charge Apple iPhone. Get a new apple iphone every year. To register and get a Free of cost iphone go to google and type: *givefonesaway*
it's a sitcom, i doubt they put that much thought into it. all these weird ass theories are reaching.
Lmao I want this to be true so bad
What a load of crap, it's only a tv show
My mom has dark brown hair and my dad has black hair and all through my childhood I was bleach blonde and then my hair eventually darkened to a dark brown
You do realize that it's not 50% chance, thats not  how genes work bruh this is basic shit a middle schooler knows better
Dude... Its a hair color mine doesn't match either one of my parents nor does my siblings. Its a show nobody really slept with anyone sounds like youre paranoid
People think way to much in to things it's a dam show
Excuse me? Can you please leave?
This is a hypothesis, not theory
So he's the rightful heir to the iron throne
Huh. And here all this time I thought Joey was the mom's brother.
You know I actually thought of this a few years back but I was like nah joey wouldn't do that to Danny
ha ha ha.... it's like you think they really exist and are the wet dream children of casting directors who prefer blonde kids.
such an idiotic theory with no evidence other than him being blonde. i watched this expecting him to go in depth with it, when he said that he was blonde i thought thats stupid. maybe this is just the surface level evidence but nope. that was the entire thing. next time, do more research, gather more evidence or don't make the video.
Or maybe Joey is actually the mom after transgender modification....🤔
I love how they finally gave clippy a show
IT'S A SHOW. CHILL OUT. DON'T RUIN THE SHOW BY GETTING SO PRECISE AND WITH DETAIL. THEY JUST HIRED RANDOM ACTORS AND PUT ON A GR8 SHOW 😂😂😂
just dont bring the twins back
Both my parents have brown hair and brown eyes. All 3 of my older sisters have dirty blonde hair with green eyes. \nI just destroyed this entire theory.
what if Danny and Jesse are sterile and joey only donated sperm? wouldn't that just strengthen their bond? i wonder if this even gets read...i never get feedback ...i never know if i'm on the ball or nuts.
This still makes more sense than the olsen twins disappearing altogether.
Please stop recycling the same crap from your articles that we've already read and bring back pop culture discussion
Passing over Saget for Coulier? Sure. Passing over Stamos for Coulier? No way. It's freaking Stamos. There is nothing about Coulier to suggest he is capable of that level of sexual prowess compared to Stamos and you oughta know better. Wait. You oughta know? YOU OUGHTA KNOW! OK, the theory in this video is 100 percent accurate.
The mom has blonde hair... and yes, both parents having blonde hair increases the chances of having blonde children, it also doesn't guarantee it.
https://youtu.be/rnJ4blc_S6g                   best I ever saw
Here me out... here me out, those kids are blonde and like... Joey is blonde. Coincidence?
Ironically enough, they give Joey 4 kids and a wife in Fuller House... Interesting
Obviously this guy doesn't know how genetics work.
Or they just happen to have hired blonde actors?
Why did i read this as insane crack house theory
i put on my headphones for this?!
The probability would be 50% for each child. They are independent on one another. Just because one was born with blonde hair does not mean the other has a lesser chance of being blonde
How about the blonde kids on Everybody loves Raymond?
Really? He's blonde and so is their Mom, therefore they're probably his kids. Logic
Or it's a show and they can't cast people properly
so you think joey banged danny’s dead wife 3 separate times with several years in between each & each time resulted with her getting pregnant? ok.
Or maybe all the kids were blond due to the fact that blondes are more appealing for television. Or also, who the fuck cares?!
It's just Joey.  Not Uncle Joey.
Wasn't Danny s wife joeys sister?
that was worth me not unsubscribing from you guys months ago.
plenty of brunette adults are blonde as children, in fact blondism is a decidedly juvenile genetic trait. ugh!
My dad had dark hair -- my mom light brown which darkened as she got old.\n\nAll four of us kids ended up with hair at various shades of brown -- no dark haired kids amongst us.\n\nYour theory is invalid. \n\nStop ruining people's childhoods.
Both my and my half-brother's dads are brunettes. We were both born with our mother's sandy blonde hair, while she herself comes from a brunette father and very light (practically white) blond- haired mother. Though to be fair mine has darkened as I've gotten older and now it's a shade where you could call it either dark blonde or light brown and it would be valid lol
My dad's hair is black and my brother and I have blonde hair so your move...
Genetics aren't that simple.   Depending on the parents of the dark haired parent, if one is blonde for example, the gene for blonde hair can be stronger.   Additionally, all 3 children are girls.   Remember that the man provides 1 X chromosome and 1 Y, whereas the woman provides 2 X, and the girls end up with 2 X's.   This means more of the woman's genes will be carried over.
I think it says more about TV executives favouring blonde children over children with other hair colours. The same is with Everybody Loves Raymond. Ray and his wife Deborah both have brown hair but all three of their kids have blonde hair. But unlike Full House, there's no uncle or friend that has blonde hair to suggest any infidelity going on.
to me, the truly _insane_ part of this, is you're paying your _rent_ doing this shit. get a _real_ job hippie. #sarcasm
Is that the horse from horsin' around?
so Joey doesn't want a relationship causes he's sleeping with all his best friends wife's, makes since, Joey's got secret game!
Unless both Joey and the dead wife have homozygous recessive alleles for blonde hair, there is still just as much of a chance that the theory is false.
Women love the funny guys
Jessies kids are probably blonde bc his wife could have been blonde but died her hair.
*MORON.. hey moron! Does it not occur to you Danny's WIFE was a blonde?!*
This is stupid as shit, making up fan stories on a fictitious show.
Ok, I have finally gotten the message....     I NEED TO GET A LIFE !!!!!!!!  🚲🚢🚙⚓⛵🎵🏈🎯⚽🎉🎉
My dad has jet black hair and my mom has blonde hair...and I have blonde hair
Why is this in my recommended?
Wait...\n\nWHAT THE FUCK?
Except Joey has brown hair.
HOW LONG IS THIS SHIT VIDEO GONNA BE TRENDING?
???????
Lol
LOL!
Stop it.
Fucking lie

Cut-It-Out.

If you read back what you just said it is jibberish. Are you just a man that can rhyme dot with tot?
Such a great cover. The vocalist is called vula and shes a uk legend. Does vocals for everyone and collabed with basment jaxx back in the day.
Yea gotta admit that was levels !!! Espesh that las on the Vocals
Can't understand a word Emile Heskey is saying.
Better than the original
Please put this on Spotify 🙏🙏
The more I listen to this, the more I love it
Is she singing for a bar of chocolate 🍫
Should get a release providing credit is given to the original artists too
TRASH. Why ask artists to perform covers? LET THEM CHOOSE.
😫💖💖💖I fell in love again
This has made my day. Song brings back so many good memories.
The singers are brilliant. His style of rap, maybe his accent just reminds me of googoogaga baby talk though...
Would be pretty great if it were not for Stormzy
This is too good!
Omg I loved the original when I was small!!!! This is so nice to listen to tho, very chill! Good job to everyone x
Reminds me of back home 💜💜
No talent at all, he just talks, that's it
'Every time I touch the mic they say BO!'
The singers are AMAZING 😍

Awful, backing singers were the stars.
This is shit.\nShe's good, but he's crap.
Can't take British rap serious. How does this man make money from singing?
Awful. Absolutely destroyed it.
Needs eloqution lessons.
100% pure garbage
I love stormzy but he ruined this song. He destroyed a classic.
que onda con ese cesped? jaja
y que queres, mira esa asquerosidad de cancha, apoya un pie y salta la pelota
Just an English comment in the middle of nowhere
jajjajjajajaja, ese tronco hp estava pensando en la burra q se iba a chancletiar despues del partido....jajjajajajajajaj\nmalo hdpta
They have bunkers in Football now?
Random Scottish comment kicking in now ........ #bawbag
Apoya el pie y se levanta la pelota. Un asco la cancha.
Para terminar jugando en Junior que se hubiera quedado con lo que le pagaban y que se quede en River ganando títulos justo que necesitamos buenos delanteros
Cual es la sorpresa? \nLa cancha es espantosa y a eso sumale un jugador mas sobrevalorado que balotelli y robinho juntos \nMuchos hablan de teo como si fuera la reencarnación de Riquelme y no llega ni al nivel de fabro un jugador del monton
ese cesped está vivo
Jajaja negro narco
humofilo gutierrez
Mejor jugador de América 2014 🤔
Esa es la calidad que dicen que tiene este hijueputa?, y así lo siguen llamando a la seleccion porque es el moso de Pekerman.
Buena vitrina el river jajaja donde término este pelmazo... Xd
lo que las canchas callan
Si no pasaba nada con el cesped y era responsabilidad suya iba ser ridiculez!! Pero al hacer el movimiento para patear, el pie de apoyo (izquierdo) se hunde practicamente hasta el tobillo levantando toda la tierra que esta alrededor de la pelota!!
Loony toons?
Jajaja negroo putoo
Arreglen ese pasto jaja que culiado
Que muerto q sos teo
😂😂😂
Jajajaja pero q idiota
Troncofilo
Jajaja no mames we No mames hijo de tu puta nadre!!! El wey se mamo alv jajajaja, +10 por el buen momazo! Sigue asi rufian! Zopotamadre se mamo el wey
le hizo daño jugar en el Cruz Azul jaja
Q cancha de mierda, es raro como se mueve el paso, q asco de terreno
que perro
jajajaja jajajaja jajajaja
No le corran el arco a Teo jjaa
Pobre Teo si él es bueno,, había un topo en el Punto de penal yo lo vii,,,😂
Pobre Teo,lo cago el césped
Jajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajaja jajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajaja
claramente se ve que en el momento q apoya el pie izquierdo antes de impactar la pelota,se levanta el pasto y x ende ,sale el penal muy desviado.creo q no es culpa del jugador..es culpa del campo de juego..
es un madera este negro vende humo.tuvo suerte nomas.carroñero del orto
RIDICULO...ES EL NOMBRE DEL VIDEO.... PORQUE SI OBSERVAN MEJOR....SE SALE EL PASTO SINTETICO DE MIERDA QUE TIENE ESA CANCHA DE MIERDA.... RIDICULOS SON LOS QUE SE RIEN Y CRITICAN BOLUDECEN...MANGA DE BOLUDOSSSS
Viendo en cámara lenta, cuando apoyo el pie se levantó el balón.
le pego asi porque el portero le hizo un hueco al punto penal
veoq mas es de la grama
Parece un volcan el punto de penal jajaja horrible la cancha peor que la de mardel.
no me digan que en esta cancha de mierda se va a jugar la vuelta de Junior vs Cerro...
Troncazo
por no tomarse las vainas en serio teo nunca será del nivel de falcao ni james
ese gramado de barranquilla es asqueroso y eso disque le pusieron una nueva, pero sigue siendo una verguenza y lo mal quue nos hace quedar cuando juega la seleccion. Los mejores cespeds estan en Bogota, tanto en el campin como en el estadio de techo, y aclaro soy paisa por si las dudas
The ball moved when he stepped on his left foot, the earth moved the ball up.
los cachacos chimbo chiquito y sus videos de ardidos, jr tu padre
y luego los burrioristas se quejan cuando les dicen que su cancha es un lodal completo
Pero putierrez a quien echaron de River, Racing, Lanús, Rosario, Cruz azul, Turquía, Sporting Lisboa y muy pronto del burrior por gamin, tronco, ladrón, atracador, homosexual, simio, bruto, narco, farsante, payaso, drogadicto, alcohólico, etc.
0:23 Al apoyar el pie izquierdo se ve cómo éste se hunde y una montaña de tierra suelta se levanta y mueve el balón. Lo único ridículo es jugar con un campo de juego en ese estado.
jejeje , bueno despues que no pase en una final todo bien, ahora que revisen que paso con el gramado en ese lugar, del resto el mejor gramado de este pais ante los potreros de metrallin, cali, rolota y demas abominaciones de estadios.
Looks awesome, can't wait to try
I CAN'T WAIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOR STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT 2
Downloading it now
Big fucking open world map , a just 4 v 4 players in the map , great job Ubisoft.
such a big map and only a few maps to play, smh
Seems cool, but idk. Seems too late to pull people back in. Servers will probably be empty in a couple months.
I cannot wait!
Could've brought people back with a battle Royale mode. It's already half made, they got the map, guns, and vehicles to make it happen. But they put their money on this?
Hey
tinha que ter modo battle royle pq o mapa é enorme
So there are 6 classes now ? never played the game, should i get it ?
Can't wait for this I just got the game and really enjoying it
They are cheesing that voice actor
I love this game and R6S
The fact that this is a DLC just shows Ubisoft and how incompetent they are. I just finished playin Wildlands. I have great intervener connection but I had lag in a solo campaign. Something is wrong with camera and player movement in Wildlands. I've never thought it would be possible to have lag in a solo game. Congrats Ubisoft you did it. Do not reply to this post, especially if your gonna say it's not possible. We're always on their server when playing.
Lame. You could and should have made it much simpler. Give everyone three armor options, a list of guns to choose and let them see who's best. Now it's about who picked the best class talents. This is another typical, run of the mill shooter for children with ADD and no skill. Long live SOCOM!
Would really like to see at least 10vs10 but I'll give it a shot
Aaaaaand they fucked up GR. Rip. You will be missed.
Awesome! Going to be a cool mode for ghost recon wildlands I can't wait to see what it holds.!
All you guys had to do was bring back Future Soldier's PvP, and just fix the hacking problem.
Listen to the people Ubisoft. This is okay but for months we been begging for something more. Atleast make it 8v8 or 6v6
I'm actually happy there are no sniper rifles in this.  Seems like a lot of map for hiding on the edges all the time.  Time to shakes things up n see how everyone plays
Took long enough almost flicked the game
I'm not one that needs PvP but this looks kickass
Can't wait wish they had sniper class because what's what I play on the hardest mode and they never see me coming lmao
Who wants this when de have pubg
when pre download beta come in ps store thailand ps4 ver. dev , community tell me....
I like for this
Is that the doom(2017) music?
Everyone who is saying you should of made it battle royale style I agree but don't forget we're talking about Ubisoft a company heavily known for having some of the worst servers in all of gaming. You really think they can support the whole map with 50-150 people, hell no 🤣🤦‍♂️
This is going to be amazing, I still play this game faithfully. I just hope we can customize class looks and weapons.
Why does the Artillery have a mine? 🤔
This would be the game for a battle royal mode and I will for sure buy it if it does but if not I'm gonna wait till a sale or dirty cheap
Boring!!!
More the Crew 2
jizzing my pants
Aaaaarrrgh! Start now!
This looks absolutely terrible
Age really
LOL
HELL YA
why just 4vs4 😢😢
What! No sniper
Nobody cares about this game anymore. It was cool the first month, now they are trying too hard.
Such a huge map and there's only 4v4 multiplayer. Pvp will be dead in just a few days
nobody cares about this\nwe want Battleroyal mode
Me gustó mucho ese juegos de Goku rico se ve brutal
The writing Hay fuerza Hay mente... doesn't make sense
Despite what anyone says. It's a beautiful game high quality, all it needs is a battle royale mode to be on par with PubG. 💪
Love them or hate them this company is still one of the biggest AAA company out there... #UBISOFT
THIS WILL BE AMAZING!!!!!\nI CAN'T WAIT!!!
I can't wait
Tbh it did die, but I preordered it, and I loved it, but after I beat it, it got boring and I had no one to play with. But I still like it because it's open world. Especially even more with PvP.
One of the greatest game ever created
When i can play definitive Edition?
Our thermal vision and night vision should come more in handy like in Bf4 the night maps were awesome because you actually had to try to find enemies i feel like that would be great in this games especially if you know what to put on your character to barely be spotted with night vision.
Love this game can't wait to get back on it after I get done with assassin creed syndicate
The sniper at 1000 meters distance headshots lmg man
5 star
Finally
Metal gear solid anyone?
Lame Lame LAME!!!
Awebo papuh!
LAME!

First comment
Wer mag Rainbow so wie ich gibt ein Like 😊
Not sure why you're trying to hype this up now. You had a chance and let us down.
Can they just stop trying to make people buy or still play this game. Ubisoft just needs to admit that they fucked up
I want to play this so bad I have a 4 person group on ghost we're going to rek people
trash we need open world a large map to travel around and hunt people down in groups i would love to be a sniper on a hill ambushing roamers in my territory . I just downloaded this back a few weeks ago but i do not have any interests in the new weapons i do not like the guns we cannot customize ourselves it makes it sort of a waist of time because we get a gun we cannot put suppressors or aim sights on
i hyped for this!
Wait, is that dude at the end in a red shirt a new operator or someone revealed?
I have 3 other friends ready to play this game we got it when it came out but we waiting for 1 to get game we gotta wait until Christmas for him to get and these updates look clean
They're trying to pull of the no mans sky. Putting things in the game that were supposed to be in there in the first place. Putting all this effort in this and I'm sure it'll all be dead within a month. Everyone has already moved on or completed the game already. Ive already got all the achievements in this game and if this has no achievements in this there's 0 reason to go back to this game and play this....0
Cod is to Internet hungry have to have real fast speed or you are always behind , I can't get fast enough Internet so.i hope this is as bad
Ubi there's a website called r6credits.com giving out free credits please take it down as it could be a scam or the real deal
disliked, idk why the hell y'all took so long
Looks cool but by the time the real thing comes out shadow of war would be out.
This game is beyond dead. One of the worst games I've ever played 4/10.
I'm haven't bought the game but this looks fun so imma try it
can I get likes for no reason?
This is why we need the Prequels!!! PLEASE HBO!! T_T
Oh SHIT I just realized that I know the lore of Westeros better than the history of my own world 😂
I like how even they themselves acknowledge that the show's depiction of Casterly Rock and Highgarden in Season 7 were colossal fails, by having them appear as completely different looking castles in this one, meanwhile the other castles shown retain their appearance from the TV series.
OMG we are going have incest 3 some YUK!!! as if incest was not gross enough.
who the hell still buys dvd's. they look like crap on current technology. DVD's are quite ancient now.
Lol, even the special features Casterly Rock looks nothing like the show's crap.
Haha, so many people would already know everything that will happen in this series.
I really wanna see a real life version of Maegor Targaryen!
PROSTITUTES ON THE STREET ★ Photo gallery \nhttps://youtu.be/dpVlcyFKxog
Ask Blizzard.. they make this clip match better! ;)
Animation is shitty. Preferred the ones where they were drawings.
The static artworks are pretty cool, too bad the animated 3D parts look like a bad PS1 cutscene.\nNice video though.
Better than the seasons 6 & 7.
It is so poorly executed that it reminds me Mortal Kombat - The Journey begins (1995)
weekly priority place changing french her alliance merely inspection
Whose voice is it?
Meh... but, is this series canon now?
Anyone else want a narrative/lore like this on Rhaegar's p.o.v about what happened before/during Robert's rebellion?
If this is a possible spin off will there be animated rhaenys sex?
First, House Durrandon's sigil was a rampant stag with a crown, the crown was removed after the battle of the conquest, only to be added back by Robert after the rebellion. Second, The Martells din't rule Dorne because no one wanted the desert. Their full name is House Nymeros Martell of Sunspear, which indicateds their liniage back to Nymeria the Rhoynar queen who took Lord Mors Martell as her husband when she fled Rhyone after it was taken over by the Valyrians.  The Dornish are the only people to withstand the conquest of Aegon and his sisters, thus retaining their Prince/Princess status. Just because the show-runners don't have Indira Varma to show off, doesn't mean Dorne is a crap wasteland
Can someone subtitling it in Spanish?
Give credit to Harry Lloyd.
Is it possible that Aegon is the god of fire ?
What songs are used in this video?
Let's be serious! Highgarden looks way better than in the show!
I want this animated series, please
Why have they released this now they normally Waite until the DVD comes out.
Anyone know who is narrating this? This is frickin' awesome. Combined with; what sounds like; Ramin Djawadi's music, I got goosebummps as soon as it started. OMG! I would #BeAllOver an *_ASoIaF_* animated series/movie/shorts, etc. Kudos, HBO.
I can't wait to see the rest!
Aegon's Sister were hot.
They definitely have to make a prequel of GOT, oh please, please. Kind of like Harry Potter and Fantastic Beast AWTFT.
More likely, Aenar met with some mishap at court and chose exile over execution. \n\nYou literally just spoke of an empire built on wonder and marvel, dragons soaring in the sky, sorcery constructing cities of amazement, and you find visions improbable? Oh, Viserys. You lovable fool.
THANK YOU! AT LAST! PLEASE DO MORE!!!
I hope they are testing the waters for a full scale animated spin-off. Animation isn't cheap but with all the effects already put into GoT, I _imagine_ good animation can still be a lot cheaper than live action. That should open up for more creativity.
I just love Harry Lloyd's narration 😍 His reading of Dunk and Egg stories was just amazing
Hey sorry to be annoying but I just started my YouTube channel and if you could spare a little time to watch my first video about Game Of Thrones that would be great! \nVideo : https://youtu.be/kgIKYSAvlUA
now....hold on a sec... did i hear it right? even the dragons were burned? i thought Dany said fire cannot kill a dragon?
Am i the only one who wished that Peter Dinklage narrated this?  A few commentaries had his sass in the voice lol
These comments make me want to sell crack to orphans.
Is the doom of Valyria a mirror of pompeii?
Is that Harry Lloyd reading?
I got lost into this world and video so deeply it didn't feel like a 4 min video, more like 2. This was so good.
And this is why I love the Targaryens 💯
Can't wait for more incest!!!!
Game of Thrones will soon become the greatest fantasy franchise of all time, it will break all records, & when it is done, StarWars, Harry Potter & LOTR, will look nothing but mediocre!!!
Is the narrator the guy who plays Viserys? It just really sounds like him.
So it's the rise and fall of the Roman Empire withe DRAGONS??? COOL!!!
Reminds me of the story of Atlantis.
Can't wait to watch the rest of these on some obscure youtube channel!
It took my awhile to realise this is Viserys's voice. Damn
They could honestly make seven more seasons of prequels to the GoT stories exploring the rich history of the world that GRRM has built.
That dragon model seemed oddly similar to skyrims dragons
Well... That's look pretty ugly and not so fine about history. That pilot made by a fan was way better to be honest:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFDOdhVAJg
Who the hell narrates this? It doesn't quite sound like Viserys, is it Rhaegar?
It was the casterlys who hold the westerlands when aegon came to westeros and aegon burned the casterlys and gardeners and 10000 men whos swords make the iron throne
Thank you for this. I am a big fan of the show.
This is nice. I would say, though, that there's a slight detail with the information: the Targaryens didn't build Dragonstone, it was already there, as the westernmost outpost of the Valyrian Freehold.
Dis is all mind blowing, u guys should pls make a game from this, or something, a game where winter comes every December, and we can choose our houses, cos dere is only one season left and I don't want to ever forget u guys, just like everyone forgot abt Lord of the rings, and pls not a telltale game pls
I really hope with all my heart that its a sign of a spin off
House Arryn held the Vale. Or Rather the Vale held them. His voice tho' <3

This bodes well for The Doom being the subject of HBO's next series.
Ruled by great families who didn't know what greatness was, Aegon would teach them
Is this a hint of an Aegon's Conquest/Old Valyria prequel? :o
Thankyou. Nearly in tears
Hint to a spin off?
Viserys reading bedtime stories to his sister
This was actually better than the first episode of season 7!
Make money very easy only wactch video\nhttp://kibuilder.com/2lBf
Is that Viserys i hear???
Just give me season 8 i beg ;-;
Wonder who is narrating???!
Nice

Poha at least 20min ¬¬ goddammit
Looks Like PS2 Graphics !
GIVE ME MORE!!!
This is awsome
Harry Lloyds voice omg so hot
Anyone notice viscerys voiced this?
MORE MORE MORE!!!!
Epic
IS this Vicerys narrating?
Wonderful!
woooooooooooooooow
We want more , we want more ......
Viserys is that you?
Words are chosen wisely
Cant wait for chapter 2
THANKYOUUUUUUUU!!
Moreeeee
Whats the ost at :50?
Fuck valeria
Damn you..i want more
1:30 Pompeii reference?
Dornish people is sexy
YASSSS
I don't know if I missed this but did the Targaryans rule Valaria?
I bet FANS are FREAKING OUT!! It's a demotion and RAW will ruin her, just like Finn Balor... and Bayley... and Sasha...
Yea fans are freaking out because the demotion to the main roster hasn't  been so great for NXT call ups
Can't Wait 4 That, She Will Be in a Class All By Herself
😘😘😘
I do NOT trust this creative team to know what to do with her.
If alexa defeats asuka i am done
Fans are freaking out because Vince will bury her
SD Live would have been better or she'll end up like Bayley
Yeh, fans are worried Asuka is coming to Raw...........................only to have Vince book her terrible and ruin her like Bayley. Not only that but have her lose her streak on Raw, or a B-level PPV like No Mercy or even have Emma pin her in a distraction roll up.
Give Asuka match with Alexa for women's championship
Oh well it was nice while it lasted. Her career will be ruined on RAW.
No im not freakin out. Just a japanese no mic work just kicking no look girl
Great, someone else who will have a small script because of her english
We're freaking out because we know she will be ruined!\n\nAlso, WWE uses fans instead of WWE Universe WTF?!
Welcome to RAW. The empress of tomorrow
I'm not definitely freaking out because I can care less about her coming anywhere she was better on nxt because I never watched that
no one is ready for Asuka
Nia will never ever taste what it's like to be champion once Asuka gets there. She had her chance twice for Asuka's NXT title and she was defeated twice. Even without Asuka on Raw she never became champion at all. What more with Asuka there?
Asuka Is Going To Win The Raw Women's Championship Easily
asuka didn't steal a thunder, she didn't even need to\nbecause she's the empress of tommorow!\nthe sun! asuka!!
Check this video to know the difference between Chinese burger and Mcdonald or Burger King burger  https://youtu.be/QqRkhtaVBM0

Rip, get ready for asuka to lose her debut
if fans were crazy it would have been depicted by video views\nasuka just another female wrestler
im not freaking out :))))) im really sad for raw womens division :))))))) plus her brock lesnar type of character will flop and wwe will keep pushing her in spite of that :(
Asuka is heading to Raw Women's Division where she beats almost every Women back then on NXT. While she haven't faced most in the SD Live Women's Division. Makes sense since Raw Women's Division needs a boost I guess
I hate this girl she just want money 💰she should have worked in the movie IT
She'll lose her first match on the call up against Dana Brooks calling it because Raw.
but what about braun and lesnar tho?
I have a question, so does her undefeated streak from NXT continue when she arrives to RAW or does it it start over!?
Asuka is going to be held back on how hard she can hit others and move set will be sliced in half. Her finisher will be changed to a damn super kick.
I just need a match Fatal-4-Way Elimination.\n\n•John Cena + Nikki Bella\n                    VS.\n•CM Punk + AJ Lee\n                    VS.\n•The Miz +Maryse\n                    VS.\n•Carmella + James Ellsworth
Well come To #Row
RAWにアスカ被害者の会ができちゃうのか…。(既に何人か犠牲者出てるけど)
Asuka will bury everyone in the RAW division
Asuka going to bury all the women on raw but Alexa because they love blondes
This is promotion mode ???😂😂😂😂\nWe want fight
It is rumored that asuka is going to debut after No Mercy and her first opponent is Emma , does that means that emma is going to win the title at No Mercy and asuka challenges her for the title ?
ASUKA / CATHY / RONDA - I see them I get a bulge. My fault?
welp time for asuka to not matter in the wwe anymore
Can't believe Americans still think wrestling is real 🤣
0:03 really missed her chance to say WELL I'M AFRAID I'VE GOT SOME BAAAD NEEEWWS
I hope I'm not the only one but I hate asuka she is going to ruin the raw women's division honestly bc of her I might not even watch raw which would be hard bc SASHA is my fav but asuka is just gonna ruin EVERYTHING
Cathy Kelley for Raw Women's Champion!
Of course we're freaking out, who wouldn't? I mean, not in a positive way, IN A NEGATIVE way because RAW is well-known for messing up big stars like Bailey, Sasha and the rest. Now, Asuka?! Jesus Christ...
freaking out at the fact that Asuka is going to get buried
Vince and Kevin Dunn are going to ruin her on the main roster.
Another roster addition that creative won't have a clue what to do with
she will be ruined within first 2 weeks on raw  MARK THIS WORDS
now we wait for MVP
*DO NOT RUIN ASUKA OR WE RIOT!*
Nice job WWE, you ruined the surprise. Idiots.
She will be ruined within 3 months, guaranteed.
I'll be snickering when she gets booked to lose after 2 months via roll up. She deserves it for not putting anyone in NXT over.
Asuka is like woman Daniel Bryan
Probably because they're worried for her career
NXT talent either dies on RAW or has no thought how to use it before they become just another piece. Anyone looking forward to Asuka becoming a four time Women's Champion in a span of three months?
I hope she comes tonight to beat the living slag out of alexa bliss
Find the difference 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕Subscribe 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
Look at this loser, running away from NXT before Liv Morgan could defeat her so she can keep her little streak. Well you can keep it, for now! NOBODIES READING FOR LIV MORGAN!!!!
Asuka will be buried soon rember this comment

Akinfenwa is really honest and very Nice guy
akinfenwa leaves the gym when the weights are tired
Akinfenwa should really be silver. He should probably be 66 or 67 rated tbh
Get Bendtner <3 !
I suspect EA do this on purpose to annoy him 😂
The one guy who actually does his stats right
This is actually Bullshit
Bring back spencer what's all this spencer should be doing it!
Akinfenwa   should be in the premier league for banter also he could hack it physically
Am I the only one who thought they walked to that table at the end to have an arm wrestle?
Akinfenwa has the wide body kit attached
Akinfenwa seems like a nice guy and honest, not like the other footballers that just give themselves more than what they deserve
Give Akinfenwa a damm silver card already.
True Geordie vs Akinfenwa
18 goals common m8 he deserves his stats
Akinfenwa should actually get a +70 card rating just for bants😂
Akinfenwa should get invited to the true Geordie podcast!!!
EA doesn't watch footie....It's a popularity competition
rio, you best centre back on history
He should really punch those people behind the ratings
Where's Da Respect
Akinfenwas voice is way too squeaky for his size😂😂
Tbh he is right...
The Fifa ratings are so stupid
Wayne Rooney just got banned for 2 years \nhttps://youtu.be/NQ3m5Ujm6Xc
He's my first signing on FIFA 18
Looking at your predicted grades to your actual grades
arent u going to announce on ur channel that ur becoming a boxer
Awesome video. Criminal that he was downgraded I thought his own ratings were quite fair.
name of tune at star is sanpellegrino franki stew and harvey gun
THE TING GO SKRRRRRA\n KA KA KA KA \nSKIDI KI PA PA \nAND A DU DU DRRR\n 4:20
just stole Spencer's video
I have 0 faith in EA ratings lmao it sometimes feels like they just have a hat with ratings and pick a random one for players. It's like they don't even watch football. And they need to stop sucking ronaldo's dick. How are you going to give messi 93 and ronaldo 94. They should both be 94
He is right he should be a little bit better he said it himself this was one of his best season and didn't upgrade him
Akinfenwa: I came like a wrecking ball
He's actually right, deserves a boost to 65 overall maybe 66 with more finishing. Don't know what EA were thinking, did way better last season compared to the one before.
Subscribe to the true goerdie i will see ya later
i love these new fifa rating videos please keep them coming 😍
It's great to have him as a proper face in Fifa
Get the card signed Rio and give it away
Akinfenwa still plays football and still bangs in goals? That's crazy.
how is he a beast If he only has 80 physical ?
He's a national treasure
UNITED fans can you please check my VLOG on my channel and leave a like even if I didn’t do a good job 🙏🏽 #GGMU
he should play as a defender .
I'm 6 ft 3 weigh around 78-80kg and I think I've got a chance in man marking akinfemwa out of a full 90 min game cmon ADEBAYO take the challenge pal
When will EA make this man a silver
Imagine his 95 Pro player card
Wtf wtf its not possible that he ia still 64 rated atleast give this man an 69 or 70 rated
Everyone else is excited for gameplays and stuff when a new fifa comes out. I wait for the akinfenwa video
This is Spencer's job
I think they should give akinfenwa an 65 silver card, this man loves the game so much and really puts effort into his career, just upgrade this guy ea it is not gonna harm you in anyway, it wil be good for the community.
The man is a beast🔥
Akinfenwa is such a cool person
Rio ur an absolute legend for united
This is what spencer does
Who is this guy???
I love Rio but Spencer should have done this.
That 99 rating just for Eddie hall, you know if he randomly picked up football for 1 season.
Akinfenwa is the only player in fifa who's stats I wait the most
What's the intro music lads
His rating should be higher
Bayo I wonder myself how EA make these ratings, feels so sloppy and ridiculous at times
I love your videos Rio. Nice one
Adebao's on the road to Rio
man Akinfenwa is annoying
Where is spencer???!!!
4:30 Rio gets all ghetto
Hahaha NOOOOO RESPECT! Real talk though they mocked him.
Akinfenwa move to La Liga, Ligue 1 or Bundesliga and the EA will suddenly give him an 88 rating because they are anti-Premier League. We all know the FIFA rating is Bullshit. PSG and Bayern pay EA to give their players higher ratings. You saw in the Champions League Tottenham easily beat Dortmund yet in FIFA the Dortmund players have higher ratings. Thiago has a higher rating than Pogba when Pogba is a better player in real life. It is just Thiago plays against weak teams and players in the Bundesliga so looks more dominant. Fabregas is a better player than Thiago too.
should be 72
18 league 2 goals ...
18 goals 😲
C
Do Bendtner
No RESPEK, no CHILL
Akin.. Oh god hes so fuckin funny
These became unfunny 3 years ago
Lllllll
Akinfenwa doesn't drop shoulders he drops players
cheers rio was fun bro
3:11 TRIGGERED
0:48 FIFA Seva'ee :D
Haha he's joke
stealing spenny's content
Where the respect??
Bring back spencer
5-0
That's EA
So modest
poora kinfenwa
Justice for Akinfenwa!
Why no spencer
Xhaka Laca Boom
Oi Akinde is better than Akinfenwa
Get Akinfenwa in the wembley cup
How is he 98 strength but 80 physical?
Everyone saying he seems nice and genuine in the comments, and I can honestly back that up. When he came to Grimsby with Wycombe, there was roughly 30 people waiting after the game for a photo and he didn't snub one person. Made sure everyone left with what they wanted and seemed genuinely happy to have a photo with fans! Really did differ to Edgar Davids who just ignored everyone who wanted a photo with him when he came with Barnet a few seasons ago.
Akinfengwa is just fat not ripped
Akinfenwa sounds about 12 years old, what a joker.
Don't worry London mayor khan will just say this is all normal events in a city...
Oh no!!! More terrorist attacks on our homeland!!! Better bring in more refugees!!!
Its sad people don't know we are the ones that brought this upon ourselves\nWe destroyed the middle east and destabilized it and fueled a extremist ideology. But hey people rather just blame others for a complicated problem than rather actually doing anything to fix the root of it.\nIgnorance is a bliss.
Religion of peace is so peaceful!
Theresa May might as well join the Labor Socialist Party. She is a cowardly panderer and a traitor to the real British People.\nMeanwhile the Hilary like mayor of London, Khan, sounds like Hilary saying 'we will not be divided'. Your Country is already divided you fool!
Didn't you guys expect this? It's normal for living in the city.
I even lost count how many times London was attacked this year alone. The old English charming town is gone forever. Sad but true.
In other news... Sadiq Khan said he would be awarding the two arrested men the London Peace Award for their efforts.
You've been bombing all life long  , so stop creating motives, to me it seems like that's a strategy of yours to keep your selves involved in the middle eastern affairs, therfore you should bare responsibility for what you do ... stop your war crimes and keep hands off the middle east , be ashamed of your selfs, you're the one's who created the PALESTINIAN problem and you're the ones besides Yankeeland who helps prevent the PALESTINIAN SOLUTION being puppets of Zionism, you must be ashamed of your inhumane acts , stop your ironies you're causing terrorism to then use it as a challenge of media and as an excuse for your war crimes , definitely it's an anti-islamic aggression you getting away with it since ww3 ??? !!!
Is it just me or is the woman's voice really annoying? It sounds like she's spitting in my ears when I have my earphones in.
they were packed in like sardines.!!.why is it not illegal (for insurance purposes especially).surely if the train is jam packed with sardines,it should be illegal?,just a thought!...if you get on a bus....there is usually a sign stating the amount of people that it is allowed to carry?.yet they pack em in like sardines!.are the sardines then covered by insurance?.......sounds fishy?
Every single terrorist was a moderate once
A lot of cowards commenting hatred behind their cloak of anonymity towards the diverse multicultural workforce in London. What they quickly forget is that the city subsidises a lot of the UK. I wonder how many out of work northerns are state dependent on the back of taxes from the ethnics in London? A lot I imagine. Now news reveals that the terrorist was an overseas refugee so not even home grown.
The leftist our gunna kill us all
London was attacked by Romans, Germans and now terrorists.
Imagine my shock, another terrorist attack. In England of all places! Very surprising!
I wonder were is the al Qaeda the taliban disappeared to now a days.
why wudnt they bomb and kill poor children and people becus there getting sent jail couple month'years and back out again and repeating them self.. wronge evil people .once they leave UKIreland go to there own country learn bomb makeing shouldn't be aloud back to UK ....yes police be around tube station for next week make people feel safe but what happens next week when there none ...24-7 Need police everyday not just wen bomb goes off !!!!!!!\nno were safe....
And yet, as some sort of counter, they'll bring up American gun violence despite our 300 something million population and the gun violence only being prominent in areas that treat guns as they would the devil. And yes, most of the murderers who shoot up people are mentally deterred and not at all politically motivated. Believe it or not, people will do anything for their religion, people are very easily brain-washed.
Most watched city on earth with cctv and know one seen any one walking on a traine with a bucket but if a person wheres air max and a baseball cap they find out where they live in hours and have there picture up a every where ...
The Religion of Peace Strikes Again !!!
Inside job. MI5 corrupt terrorists, planted the bomb! All part of the agenda. \nProblem reaction solution!
Cowardly, evil subhuman muslime filth need to be butchered off the face of the earth!
I heard of this this morning and I was just like \n\n*just another day in london*
Ffs..does this incident qualify for the lighting of candles or does someone have to die..I will phone  sad IQ khan ..he will know
are they sure it wasn't someone using a discontinued samsung galaxy note 7?
That officer ran out of tape and looked anxious
Izlam .......... iz ........... EVIL\nget out and get your loved onez OUT while you can.
Stay calm,  you're being invaded.  They will slaughter you.,,,
This is what happens when you let millions of people whose ideology directly conflicts with the UDHR into a civilized country.
Someone just left their Note 7
Why do these terror attacks happen now?
this is scary i use the London under ground and seeing that really scares me
We should stop all reporting on these incidents. All we are doing is playing into the hands of fools who get glory and recognition on TV and in the papers for what they have done. We are, in effect, keeping their momentum going and playing right into their hands.
A bucket in a train, is that the best false flag theatre MI5 could come up with? LOL.
Looks more like an battery explosion/fire to me and batteries can catch fire and vent very quickly  - it will be interesting to see if this really is a terrorist incident.
All day I was wondering why my school was on lock down and now I realise how close I was to the attack. I get off at Fulham Broadway the station before Parsons Green. Not gonna say my school name but the motto is: Respice Finem.
Some builders paint went on fire
Europe needs to stop letting in all these refugees
Those responsible dont ve to use the tube\nThey are well protected
the religion of peace strikes again.
Yep England keep letting them in, oh and pay for them too..
No doubt there is an investigation underway and maybe security will be found 'wanting'. Politicians will once again be rolling off the heart felt sentiments and maybe some people will call for hanging to be brought back (dead jihadis!) and once again most people will lose sight of the obvious fact, how did they get into our country? Do you recall not so long ago the scandal of murderers being allowed to return from Syria, the only people who can allow that to happen is the government. Bearing that in mind, are the government not criminally complicit for any deaths by terrorist who have returned from Syria? Your views appreciated. God bless you all.
As long as you have a political ties with KSA you expect more than that!
i am sorry to say this, but feal i must. if there is a god, i,m sure he wouldt want all this blood bath and war. the god i grew up to know wants peace and harmony for all mankind and woman, not war and killings and bloodbath, peace and love.
Theres no proof that its an act of terrorism
lol it was the reporter
The world disgusts me now. What people do to each other
Wake up england wake up its getting late
London just can't catch a break can they.
Hey! Wait for the next attack. Till then  let the religion of peace lull the politicians to sleep.
Relax everyone they were obviasly explosions of peace and friendship.
So how's that diversity working out for you England?
Terrorists are like fleas you just can't get rid of them. You can give the kitty a flea bath, treat the kitty with pesticides and put a flea collar on the kitty, and yet the kitty will still have some fleas. So at the very least we should start viewing these terrorists as parasites. Then if somebody ever discovers how to get rid of fleas on a cat, then perhaps we'll know how to eliminate terrorists.
I wonder what poor smuck they are going to blame for their false flag.
Oh hey look, number 14, nice job u.k, making the world see how peaceful and nonviolent your immigrants are. Honestly the u.k is one of the saddest countries now. They're literally being plowed and they're just laying there taking it because they aren't racist so they won't close borders
Why do they have to investigate it to be a terrorist attack.  Nobody has went to wilkinsons and bought an ironing board that blows up
Another ISLAMIC attack in London. I'm surprised. Boy that religion of peace really injures and kills a lot of people. Hmmmm
This is not a terrorist attack
cheers for funding them US and UK governments.
Religion of peace leaves another calling card. Gee.....could it be islamic terror....uh....let me think...reason says yes, but my multicultural side says it can't be....it's so confusing.....NOT!
If we don't remove Kebab, this will just keep happening.
Oh look, it's more diversity...why are y'all complaining, it's just their culture?...don't you go being a racist bigot now, ya' hear?
People in the comments keep making jokes but what they're too blind to see is that this is serious and people have died, and are still going to die. I live here and it's scary knowing that everywhere I go there could be another attack. They have not made it safer because it's happening more often. Bullshit government we have over here!
Prayers from London to London 🙏🙏🙏well done America for not letting those refugees in 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
why do i get te feeling that all this is a lie? i guess im not surprised anymore oh and one more thing TERRORISM HAS NO RELIGION
Mayor Kahn of London is the problem not the solution.
and then the mayor is seen holding a dove...
Another fine job by MI5.  Terrorism is not existent since 1998.
When she says 4 attacks she casually missed out the attacks that were stopped at the last minute.
well at least they have common sense to say what it is right away... Americans (i live) be like... we aren't sure what it is and will let you know next week....
Morons are ruining Europe. European vacation? No thanks.
Bullshit: there was an explosion and the carrier and bucket is still in tact... after the explosion.
It was confirmed as a Japanese Terrorist.
Religion of Piece !!\none human piece here ...another their
What a peaceful Religion. So peaceful. The religion of peace. Yes. Quite.
Fake attack
Still no word about Iraqi WMDs
Bullshit little bit fire
Thank you ,Sadiq Khan.
Terrorist incident
Any casualities?
London my love
Unbelievable...
Thanks Tony Blair!

If this was a white man doing this then it would be called mentally ill man blows something up
I live in a small village in England where they haven't arrived YET. I keep a purdey  in the kitchen ready for when they do.
BRITAIN BELONGS TO WHITE PEOPLE
I sometimes think to myself what would the world be like without religion 🤔

We should hit back, return the serve!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The song in the beginning is called time of the season by Zombies
I didn't even recognize Spacey until they said it was him!
the boy who was kidnapped planned the whole thing
Will watch this movie for Kevin Spacey! <3
This trailer looks like crap to be honest. Walhberg or Mr Rich is the mastermind behind this kidnapping... as to what happens in between is neither here nor there.
Prob going to see this in theater
The trailer does an amazing job of making you want to know what happens in the movie.\nI don't really watch movies much at all, but this is one I might actually go see.\nHe says he'd pay nothing to get his grandson back, so I need to know by what means he gets his grandson back, if at all.\n\nWell played Sony
Is that Tom Cruise narrating this trailer?  Sure sounds like him to me.
That's how Donald trump will say if his grandson got kidnap 😩 How much money will you release to your grandson nothing 👏
I should've became an actor! U know what....I think I'll focus on becoming one. Headed to central casting!!
Anyone know the song?
WOW AMAZING STORY. I hope Michelle gets an Oscar or something for this role. She looks amazing.
Maybe ya'll will now get an idea how easily it will be for the jew IlluminAti to throw those who follow them under the bus.
topher grace from that 70's show is that you?
It seems like they gave away too much now. Mark may find a way to get Getty's son back?
At 1:15 they say the title of the movie.👍
saw this as an ad, and I just had to see it again.
Looked like a good film, then mark whalburg showed up
well since its sony i bet 500$ IT WILL FAIL AT THE BOX OFFICE
Lol I got 20$ on my pocket😁
I've lost all faith in Ridley.
17 million is pocket change when it comes to the actual wealthy
Wahlberg always has that same WTF is happening expression on promotional stills. 😨😱😵
Did they remix part of the original Zombies - Time of the Season just for this trailer or is there a full version of the remix?
Looks good, i like the remix of the song.
I would build a USS Enterprise - How about you ?
They kinda told the story in the trailer.
What? They manage to kidnap the grandson of the richest man in the history of humanity and ask for 17 million? Yeah that's a lot but c'mon might as well as for a few billion dumbass
I saw mark whalburg in the thumbnail I was like oh no everyone shut up ima watch this
I really hate the few seconds of preview for the trailer in the beginning. I DONT NEED A PREVIEW OF A TRAILER DUMBASS
The kid is released six months after being kidnapped by some italian mafia. The kid goes to new york and becomes a heroin addict. He dies at 54. Boom saved you from another mark walhberg movie.
whats the name of this song playing during the trailer????
i felt like i watched the whole movie...imagine the last scene of the trailer is the ending ...nothing  -plot twist!
i love watching people with more money than me buy stuff i'll\ntake 83 tickets

First thing I thought of was Gettysburg.
Rothschilds have all the money but their net worth is unpublished
Lamorris Walker on Facebook is the next best actor rising
Be quiet about your wealth and avoid these situations.
what feels am I suppose too feel when I watch this :/ \nare people even going to walk up to me and say, oh man did you see All The Money you need to go see it \nthis is just another The Big Lebowski only it's not inventive, relates to no one and trys too hard
I hope Michelle Williams gets her 5th Oscar nominee
GIVE ME THIS COOL SOUNDTRACK PLZ. SO BRILLIANT
We [the super rich] look like you but we're not like you is a profound statement
Mark Wahlberg is Mr Propaganda at the moment. Boston Bombing CHECK. Gulf Oil Disaster CHECK. Improving the image of Billionaire businessmen CHECK. What's next scumbag
What song is it ?
This movie is a fucking lie. The richest being in the history of the world is Mansa Musa of Mali a black west African man.
Grandpa is savage af
dude said NOTHING....lol
Mark Wahlberg👌👌👌👌👍👍🙌
looks great
MUST MISS
Jake Paul Getty 1:52
That song 🔥
Wow definitely wanna see this. :)
n0thing
Jeez Kevin. Easy on the banana peels.
Hell yes!
Awww, those poor insanely wealthy people. breaks your heart.
NOTHING
Song name?
Ridley's First Film With TriStar Pictures
omg is this about gigi gorgeous's girlfriends family ?
is that a true story?
Song:  Zombies - Time of the season
now THIS is a movie I'd watch!
Nice to see Wahlberg playing an actual character.
Yep. Pay one ransom. It will happen again. People forget that. jrichardsingleton.blogspot.com
jesus christ, mark wahlberg is fucking everywhere these days. hes like the new rock
There's no fucking way that's Kevin Spacey! He looks so different!!!
What's with these trailers that got these fast highlights at the beginning? It's fucking retarded man.
We've pretty much just watched the whole story throughout the movie, thanks trailer!
Nothing
WOW looks awesome..
PLEASE ENABLE CAPTIONS/SUBTITLES FOR BETTER AUDIO/VIDEO VIEWING UPDATE:Thank you so much everyone for viewing. if you enjoy my new beat smah the like button and share on social media a few times for me. https://youtu.be/liIjwh85jk0
At first, when the narrator in the beginning said, It's like we're from another planet. I thought it was a movie about the rothschilds. And I thought, the reptilian CGI, better be impeccable!!! But still COOL TRAILER, definitely give a watch!
Finally, something with a descent story line.
simply they told us all the story
; This motion-picture does a great disservice to J. Paul Getty, and, obviously, what else can one expect from liberal, anti-Capitalist, nin-com-poops?\n\nAs someone who was a young adult during this time, and watched it happen on television, and in the news-papers, J. Paul Getty couldn't pay the ransom, ( Although, later, he did pay a portion of the ransom money. ), because it would put any other of his family members at risk for kidnapping, or worse forms of extortion, i.e., Criminals are never satisfied, and will repeat the same stupidity, because criminals are insane.
If I didn't know better I would've thought that man was an old Bruce wayne in a live action film.
Ridley scott has awaken again
They are all entitled to NOTHING!
Lizard people
Your grandfather was Mansa Musa?
Sony making a good film?
As soon as I was Kevin spacey I said I got to watch this
Didn't know this was a based on a true story, just watched a youtube video on the his grandson. By the sounds of it though i think j Paul Gerry set up for his grandson to be kidnapped to give him more limelight. His grandson sure was made to suffer thanks to his greedy selfish grandad, Hope he had a horrible death. Can not wait to see this movie for sure 😀
Diamond tire charge employer reluctant spring Senate check wonder.
Lol I had thought the trailer ended at 0:06

dumb
So confused on wtf this movie is about
His outback hates their outback
I just watch Hank Green rap. About butts . . .
(Aussie) Can't stand places skimping on their toilet paper.
I have no words...
I keep saying I should buy a bidet, but I never have... Spending a year in Iraq with cheap toilet paper wrecked my butt. It took years to recover. I'm not exaggerating.
This is a very Hank video and I love it.
I'm so happy to have seen this video
I have Crohn's. I feel your pain... literally.
Baby powder and body glide- my super hero weapons
Hank, I installed a cheap Astor bidet (it's on amazon) at my home. Huge life improvement. \nThe other thing you can try is (less pleasant, for sure) is the solution that muslims in  South African often do- a water bottle, some squeezing- okay it's not at all pleasant but it sure beats weak TP!
This was weird but really good.
That butt cheek rap... thank you for that.  This is your best video since Accio Deathly Hallows!
Hank, with all the love in my Hufflepuff heart, get. some. sleep.
But... But... I thought Quilton loves your bum...
that was wild.
DUDE - have you seen my rant from Playlist DC?
Did anyone else notice his bedhead going on in this? The little flapping strands of hair on the back of his head. Ahhh, it's cute. :)\n\nP.S. Butts.
I RAISED MY HAND I HAVE PILONIDAL SINUS
Been awhile since I laughed out loud at Vlogbrothers. Thanks, Hank!
Australia's toilet paper is like the Australians themselves : rough, tough, and doesn't take shit off of anyone.
i wasn't ready for the butt cheeks rap
I had to stop watching due to slow buffering the other day and when I just clicked to continue watching it was the butt cheeks rap and needless to say I got some weird looks
I'm sorry for your struggles, Hank, but it sure makes a funny video!
nice veiw of the BROWN Yarra River, a river in which dead bodies are found frequently.
Australian shops are required to give a price per 100 sheets for toilet paper. You're welcome
Tmi guess but who gives a crap? (Lol) Aw man i think I'm the exact opposite on my tp preferences lol I HATE charmin (the bear brand) because it's tooo soft and falls to pieces. Literally. Tmi but I stg I was at my parent's house (they buy charmin) and hours later I found pieces of tp still there. I feel so damn unclean. I actually much prefer the terrible public-bathroom tp over that stuff. Least it doesn't fall apart! (I usually go with the 1ply cotonelle, it's strong and does it's job) \n\nGod, why do Vlogbrother's videos make me feel like oversharing so much lmao sorry 😂💩🐻🚽
Satin is a way of weaving so your sheets could have been satin made out of cotton! Though that's unlikely, it's possible.\nAlso a nice hotel should have enough budget for nice toilet paper. I've been to mediocre hotels that had nice toilet paper!
No bidet's? What are you? Common savages?
Do Australians just have iron butts? Well... yes.
Can you john collaborate on a children's book?
Tired Hank is awesome
You should have wiped your butt with those bed sheets.. thatll make a statement and hopefully the hotel owner takes the hint and improves the quality of the toilet paper :)
I think there's a GMM episode in which they determine the best toilet paper. If that helps you shopping ^^
I saw you at VidCon Australia
It's not your butt cheeks it's your inter gluteal cleft... I learned that from crash course... I'm like 90% sure that's where I learned it from... but I may be wrong.
Reminds me of that old game, toilet tycoon simulator. In this game you operate a commercial restroom and people pay you money to go take a dump basically. As you earn money you can upgrade different elements of your toilets like the bowl and the paper. You start with regular toilet paper, then you get the extra fluffy stuff and at some point people are wiping their bums with silk. I remember the highest toilet paper level is Minx Fur. \n\nI'm not making this up, this is a real game.
Buy a portable bidet! Problem solved. This is the one I got. Works really well:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Brondell-GS-70-GoSpa-Travel-Bidet/dp/B008CSDKSQ/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1505791651&sr=8-4&keywords=portable+bidet
Dear Hank, \nI was very sad when I found out that your show in Portland sold out while I was at work. This video made me happy again. Thanks for sharing your amazingly awesome weirdness with all of us. I'll miss seeing you in Portland.
Hank...... This video was a lotta fun
Oh these are your butt cheeks\nYour gluteus what cheeks?\nGet some A+D ointment\nAnd make an appointment\nAnd end irritation\nAs you strut cheeks\n\nYour butt cheeks\nThese hands are your butt cheeks\nThe motion I'm makin'\nIs a simulation\nOf the action\nOf both of your butt cheeks\n\nThese are your butt cheeks\n\n\nYou're welcome, internet.
Hank, I missed your weird side. \nI work in a hospital where people get treated for butt problems, and I sometimes have butt problems. The toilet paper is HORRIBLE. Coincidence? Perhaps. OR guaranteeing more business.
That Rap... is going to be the next top single of 2017
I have three words for you, Hank... Flushable. Wet. Wipes. Not only cleans your butt much better, but is way more comfortable. I'm a complete convert.
This was an incredible viewing experience. 😂
Okay Hank, what drugs did you take? Can you take more because this was hilarious.
I'm sorry, was that the crow soundbite from The Simpsons?
This is a lot.  I am happy about this.
God that was excellent
I have a bidet on my toilet and will never go back to not having one. But, when traveling I always carry wipes.
What was that Hank???
Do a video about Brexit please...
this feels like old vlogbrothers I love it
Thank you for your honesty and candor about this subject. I have gastro issues and this is the truest thing ever.
I don't know why it took me two days to get to watching this masterpiece. I'm crying from laughing.
Boudreaux's butt paste is my fav cream. It kind of smells like cookie dough, too (smell BEFORE application).
It's Charmin. And yes you should bring it with you everywhere apparently :P
This is why I use wet wipes. Wish they weren't terrible for the sewers though.
Yeah I know what you are talking about I live in Australia and the toilet paper in schools is so bad ,like the only place you can find good paper is if you buy it yourself.
Peri bottle. Or travel bidet. That's what you need, Hank.
And I JUST watched Vox's video about triplets in rap and then Hank drops that madness.
sorry about ur butt :(
WTF did i just watch, lol
VlogBrothers /Hank,,\nI too feel your pain. Don't let the name fool ya, Charmin Ultra Strong is the way to go. Worth every penny. Because A man has to do what a man has to DOO and you shouldn't be dreading the before or after. 😯\nHere's hoping everything comes out alright. \nok, I've gotta go ,give it a try. You won't be disappointed. BTW, you can prevent splashdown and significantly cut down on the ode de doo aroma with a product called \nV.I.Poo.\nI WISH I was making this $#!+ up..\nlmao
Buy a bidet!!! It attaches to your existing toilet, hooks into the water and only costs around $150 for most of the bells and whistles (slow close lid, heated seat, front and back wash, adjustable temp and pressure, and even more butt related things). It is the second best thing you can do for your bathroom. First best thing? Squatty-potty. It is the truth.
Hank needs to do more videos like this 😄
Hank, other than your butt are you ok man?
Just thinking about all the nerdfighters that are going to have this as their first video introduction.
there is one thing I absolutely can't stand is Australian accents!!!!!!!!!!
2:23-2:41 what did I just watch
Need to hop on the diss track trend
*Raises Hand* I have butt problems.
Oh Hank, I feel your pain. I'm Aussie, and I have butt problems - I could recommend you the good toilet paper if you ever come back. I just spent a week on a cruise ship with the second worst toilet paper I've ever had the displeasure to use. Like seriously P&O, I would be happy to pay an extra $10 to have good toilet paper - maybe you could make that an option when booking one's ticket.
Maybe people thought the nice toilet paper was complimentary, so they took it all.\nAnd the hotel was like; we're going to take a square from our friends over at Wal-Mart
It's me when I haven't slept enough lol
i have Noassatall.  That's a butt problem, right?
This is very interesting to me because I (a Brit) was recently in America and EVERY SINGLE ROLL I came across in my three months there were all single ply, even in people's houses. Now I'm in Canada and have never been more grateful for that extra ply, whatever the heck a ply is.
What am I watching? The butt cheeks song... that was random
As someone who lives in Melbourne I can confirm that pretty much nowhere has nice toilet paper. Not restaurants, not hotels, not anywhere. It's a bad time.

The song Thoe......
I wasn't emotionally prepared for this... Why did I wait until Monday morning...
I am Australian and generally assume that any public toilet including hotels will have single ply crepe paper for toilet paper. I lived in halls of residence and found it very handy to have your own decent toilet paper supply. It's just expected that public toilet paper is bad toilet paper. So yeah. This also applies to hotels. A nice hotel is not defined by its rooms or its price. It's defined by whether or not it will fork out for decent and also a DECENT AMOUNT of toilet paper. 2 rolls is not enough for a weeks accomodation I'm telling you!
1. 🙋🏼 Butt problems! \n2. I really want a full version of This is Your Butt Cheeks... Like, seriously. It's stuck in my head and I'm not even mad. \n3. This is probably my favorite vlogbrothers video in a long time.
Just realized that John has the same type of front teeth in the lower Jaw that I have xD
Hey Hank! In Britain supermarkets DO give you the per yard cost of toilet paper (actually, I think it's per sheet). It's written in little numbers under the price label. They do this for nearly everything, not just toilet paper: they tell you how much your raspberries cost per gram, and how much your orange juice costs per ml. It's great and so useful.
I know for a fact that you spent way too long on that rap. well done hank. well done
Are we going to have a 2017 nerdfighteria census? I don't want to come off like I'm pressuring you, Hank. I get that you're super busy. I've just been hoping for a while that you would release one because I like taking them. They're fun. Again, no pressure.
Think I know true cause of your problem...... Cheap food IN must eventually OUT.
Hank is a wonderful human being.
I swear, Australia has good toilet paper available! This hotel is letting us down.
A couple of weeks of bad toilet paper once gave me months of pain and bleeding and PANTS AREA UNPLEASANTNESS. I feel so much less alone in the world now. #buttproblems
been a while since we've had a Hank song like that ...
You realise that the next time you come to Australia, everyone you see will have rolls of our softest bog roll/dunny paper/pottypaper, just for you.
Isnt this guy from clashcourse?
Goodness!
Erm ... are you OK, hank? ;-)
Use your hands Hank. 😂
Butt problems make Hank angry.

i mean, the population of lgbtiq people in australia are going through a political situation that is incredibly dangerous to our mental and physical health - speaking, of course, about the nation-wide survey to determine whether we are seen as humans in the eyes of the greater population - but, sure, talk about toilet paper. Whatever.
So its not a horror, but a mindfuck? So thats what it was about
Jeremy is going to go in depth on mother .....
Dude this movie messed me up! Im so glad that the trailers were made the way they were. I knew i was going to see a scary / thriller movie and thats what i got. Was it the story i thought it was gojng to be? No! But i loved it!
Mother was good, but the last 15 mins was a little too over the top
Religion is stupid and to prove it we're going to show a bunch of people eat a baby then get lit on fire. The movie is really deep and artistic because I said so and if you find it disturbing, offensive, or unenjoyable you're just an idiot who can't fathom my genius. That's the movie in a nutshell.
I spent enough time in film classes in college to know that this is not my cup of tea.  I think I'd rather it was the Rosemary's Baby ripoff the trailer seems to promote.  Glad I've listen/watched the spoiler reviews as I'm not paying for this one.
Personally thought it was obnoxiously pretentious and uppity to the point of enjoying its own farts but glad Jeremy disagrees it's always fun when you have a different opinion and can discuss and debate it like civilised decent human beings
Jennifer Lawrence's acting here was career defining. Don't give your opinion if you haven't seen the movie also.
I loved Aronofsky right from Black Swan. He has a way of. Making douchebag actors really perform on the levels of say, Pacino or Streep. \nAll in all, as I'm yet to find an Aronofsky movie I hate (even Noah was brilliant for me) I think I'll love Mother
I think the secret to enjoying mother! is realizing that it's actually a comedy, a dark absurdist comedy. It's just Aronofsky has a much darker sense of humor than the average moviegoer.
This is the worst review I've ever seen
YOOOOOO tyrone magnus review and jeremy's spoiler review are 11:23
Absolutely loved this film. It was a pretty awful experience from start to finish, and you really went away thinking like what the hell just happened. It's wide open to interpretation. If you're dealing with relationship issues, or you're grappling with world issues, or if you're dealing with anxiety or depression, or religion or whatever, this film will mean something different depending on your state of mind.
Yes or no is it worth spending my money on please people
If you love Annabelle the doll riding Optimus Prime fighting a triple threat match between The Hulk and Sharknado directed by Micheal Bay. Yeah, this is not for you.
*only movie I have ever walked out of half way thru to go have a cigarette! very bad movie!*
Aronofsky makes weird as fuck movies all of which aren't as good as people say they are however I thought The Wrestler was fantastic and if he made more films like that I'd be a bigger fan of his... thank fuck that he didn't direct Wolverine. Mother was boring and too full of itself and was just plain mental but hey that's just my opinion.
it does have depth but the symbolism was far from subtle. Metaphors/symbolism were a tad obvious and the movie hits you over the head with its messages. Yeah it's different and unique but that doesn't automatically make it a masterpiece. It's being called pretentious because it is. The ending gets so out there I couldn't help but laugh at that moment. Still thought it was okay and a decent watch though lol. The 68% score on RottenTomatoes.com is pretty accurate.
Fuck you and your 30 second un-skippable add
Was gonna see this movie but since it's another mind fuck than a horror skip
This was an amazing wonderful beautiful film. The Story of Human.
Is it not a remake of Rosemary's baby?
This movie felt like Saving Private Ryan.... in a Home. \nAWESOMETACULAR
I'm only re watching this for 0:37.
people don't like j. Law because of her acting or recent appearances, it is because she has to give her political opinion every time she opens her mouth now.
This movie was so stupid. It was as if the director thought we were idiots. Like seriously audiences are smart and we don't need the metaphors to be so blatant and in our face. I hated it
Requium for a Dream is a highly overrated piece of shit and Black Swan was average at best... guess I'm a steer clear of this flick
I haven't seen it but I'm guessing it has a bunch of feminazi ,anti-American propaganda anti-Capitalism, and anti-fame worshipping propaganda in it. Which is hypocritical because it stars really famous actors who love being in the spotlight. Notably Jennifer Lawrence. What a douchbag! Maybe Darren's directing saves it.
My problem with jennifer lawrence is that studios blatantly try to sell her and shove our faces with more and more forced jlaw everytime. Like it's so obvious that some research found that jlaw sells movies to the average consumer so let's just have her in everything. I mean she is talented but since she's in 30 movies per year i just see her as miss. Actress woman in every role. She's not even likeable either, lol. I guess she screwed up when she used an important rock in hawaii to scratch her butt, whatever, but last year she made fun of a latin reporter literally trying to translate his notes? No thanks. She's just an ignorant kid who got real famous real fast and since studios are trying to exploit her as much as possible I'll just skip her movies.
This movie is completely metaphorical, I don't just mean there are metaphors in the movie... I mean the movie itself is not the movie itself 😐................................................ 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I saw mother! and I did not like it at first but now I kinda dig it.
Mother! is one of the best movies of the year. @3:37... A Ghost Story.
I went to the theater and watch Mother! without reading the synopsis of the movie and I didn't understand what was happening but I was like oh shit what's going to happen next. Only after the movie than i read it online and than I started realizing what each scene meant and what the movie is really about. Really thought provoking movie seriously guys for those of you who haven't watched it please go ahead! I also want to add that JLaw's acting skills in this movie is the best I've ever seen honestly guys you won't regret it.
Seen it last night Jennifer Lawrence is The Virgin Mary, the husband is God then they have Jesus Hollywood puts there twist on it eat and kills Jesus he don t  even make it to the cross then Jennifer Lawrence burns the house up and the movie starts all over because the end of the world is next weekend. \n\nBut tbh I really enjoyed the movie, good scary movie if you're a Christian.
I found the movie very interesting and I didn't think it was bad but I felt it would have been better if like 30 minutes of the film was cut from it. Warning to everyone who is going to watch it. This movie is long as fuck! Or maybe it's because you're so confused for the majority of it that it felt long. Either way, not a bad film
Jennifer get her boobs out.. That makes it a 10/10 from me.
no, this movie is shit fuck this movie
Well Jenifer Lawrence has just been acting like a bitch lately, so why would I support her films?
Ms. Lawrence please go open a Zoo or something and don't make any more Movies.
So i gust it is call mother I gust it should be call mother fucker 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

I enjoyed the imagery, symbolism and allegorical depth of this movie but I did not connect with it emotionally at all. I think I just have a hard time connecting with characters that are not really people but instead allegorical cyphers. While interesting to watch it left me 100% emotionally cold.
Its the most vulgar movie ever.!!
Dawg I haven't let go of Jake Gyllenhaal not winning an Oscar for Nightcrawler either haha
How is it not a horror movie? It's _called_ Mother!\nAlso now I must see this movie.
Just saw it, and it was possibly the worst movie of the decade. No idea how JL, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfifer could sign onto this horrible movie. I know the weed nowadays is awesome...but did no one sober up to tell the director this plot sucks and we will help you write a different plot. Horrible...
People keep trying to make this movie seem super deep and complex. It's just a shitty movie. It's the most pretentious shit I have ever seen.
i thought these movie had something to do with Danzig.
I like her nudes
Heard this movie wasn't good. So much Mystits blamed Trump for it and demanded a raise.
Jennifer Lawrence is a good actress for her age. Still a little immature to play some roles, but I don't see how she can get anyone aside from die hard fans of The Hunger Games to go and see her movies. She isn't that good looking, and that only matters in acting when starting a career. I don't see the appeal in her. Do people think she is a better actress than most girls her age? Some fan of hers, please post a link to a scene she has been in where it highlights her talent... and Hunger Games clips don't count. I fell asleep in the theater during the original.
she does suck she adds nothing to any movie
And out of respect for Darren Aronofsky I'm not gonna tell you what it is...because no one knows what it is.
I agree with the JLaw fatigue. She's a good actress but it's just like... SHE'S IN EVERYTHING. GOSH.
this movie is like oh i get whats going on, 2 seconds later what the fuck is going on?? seriously weirdest movie ever, great experience though
nightcrawler was fucking amazing ......... the world knows nothing!!
I came out the movie and I was like I need to see it again just to put eveything back in palce
This film was unique, I don't know if I hate it or I love it. I was gasping the entire time thinking what the fuck lol
This movie is end of evangelion confusing with its visual metaphors
Funnily enough, the trailer almost made me not go. A spoilerfree review (not this one, though) did.
You are one of the few people I see review this movie that actually sums up exactly what this movie is. Well done.\nExcellent movie. Don't expect it to be entertaining, but the message is powerful.
Based on how he reacted to 'Drive' all those years ago, I was pretty confident JJ would DESPISE 'mother!' Colour me very surprised
(I AM):\n\n(Gk. ego emimi);\n\n*(John 6:35)<---And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst).\n\n*(John 10:7)<---Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep).\n\n*(John 10:14)<---I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine).\n\n*(John 15:1)<---I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman).\n\n*(John 18:5)<---They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them).\n\n***Strong's #1473; 1510:\nThis expression denotes self-identity in self-sufficiency. In one breath, Jesus asserted His eternal preexistence and His absolute deity. Abraham, as with all mortals, came into existence at one point in time. The Son of God, unlike all mortals, never has a beginning. He is eternal; and He is God.\nThis is evident in Jesus use of the words I AM for Himself. This statement recalls the Septuagint (The Greek OT) translation of Exodus 3:6 & 14, in which God unveiled His identity as the I AM WHO I AM. Thus Jesus was claiming to be the ever-existing, self-existent God.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n(Jesus, The Great I AM!):\n\nJesus said unto them,\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\nBefore Abraham was, I AM.\n\nThen took they up stones to cast at him:\n\nbut Jesus hid himself, \nand went out of the temple,\ngoing through the midst of them, \nand so passed by.\n\n(John 8:58-59).\n\n***(I AM): Jesus was not just claiming to have lived before Abraham; He was claiming eternal existence. He was claiming to be, God Himself.\n\n***(Exodus 3:14)<---And (God) said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, (I AM) hath sent me unto you.\n\n***This time the Jewish leaders understood that Jesus was claiming to be God, so they took up stones to stone him for blasphemy. \n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n(Jesus claims equality with God in Power):\n\nThen answered Jesus \nand said unto them,\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\nThe Son can do nothing of himself, \n\nbut what he seeth the Father do:\nfor what things soever he doeth, \nthese also doeth the Son likewise.\n\n(The Son can do nothing of himself): Means that action by the Son apart from the Father is impossible because of the unity of the Father and the Son. (Whatever he does, the Son also does): Is a claim of deity and unity with the Father).\n\nFor the Father loveth the Son, \nand sheweth him all things \nthat himself doeth:\nand he will shew him \ngreater works than these, \nthat ye may marvel.\n\n(The son does what the Father does because the Father loves the son. Moreover, because the Father loves the Son, he reveals all to him. The Father would show the Son greater works than the healing of the sick man. Jesus would raised the dead and eventually judge humanity).\n\nFor as the Father raiseth up the dead, \nand quickeneth them; \neven so the Son quickeneth \nwhom he will.\n\n(The Son gives life): As God raises people from the dead and gives them life, so Christ gives people spiritual life. Jesus claimed the same power as God, thus claiming that he is equal with God).\n\n(John 5:19-21).
Nightcrawler should have won many awards.\nMother trailer was very 'Rosemary's Baby' to me, but after this review, I gotta go see it. \nAlso, Brigsby Bear with Mark Hamill. Have you seen it? Will you review it? I enjoyed it.
Wow. An insightful review from Jeremy Jahns that stands above his peers. Amazing.
The movie was a amazing experience I have t seen a movie that just mind f@u ked me so much
I don't give a fuck about Oscars really peter sellers didn't win for dr strangelove Goodfellas didn't win Oscar even Stanley Kubrick didn't win any damn thing !!!
When u go watch this movie please pay attention to detail!!!!! Keep an open mind also!!!! I feel like the people that didn't like the movie didn't really pay attention to detail .
Please contact me if you do not mind,Commit myself\nPSID   furyusai
Don't watch this movie
Just call it a fucking allegory
Jeremy my nigga. I been watching this nigga for years but this fucking confused me.
It's cinemascore is an F
I was actually interested in watching this movie but i completely lost any interest in it when you said that J. Lawrence was in it...
I went into this movie expecting the feature length film of the trailer\n\nHow dare I
My wife and I saw the movie yesterday to a near empty Saturday showing. I purposely didn't read explanations beforehand so that I could form my own opinion. I mistakenly thought it was going to be a Rosemary's Baby kind of plot.  The one heads up was hearing Lawrence say The house represents earth.\n\nAfterwards, both of us left the theater thinking it was a swing and a miss. Almost every shot of Lawrence was a tight shot that totally filled the screen with her face. The two most relevant segments of the movie seemed like never ending nightmares you couldn't wake up from. Not an experience you could call pleasurable or entertaining. \n\nCertainly the director had delusions of being Fellini but what you have is an embarrassing;y bad movie with a laughable last scene in which Lawrence is covered with fake looking make up meant to look like here charred remains. \n\nThe few people in the movie were checking their watches during the last 30 minutes. Maybe worth watching on Netflix.
The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, friends! \nHe loves you! Believe it! Don't listen to the lies of the enemy, Jesus Christ LOVES YOU! Repent and put your faith in Him! \n\nHe is not angry at you! He will help you with whatever you are going through. He is waiting on you to call out to Him. He will deliver you. \n\nI pray you make this moment you call upon Him, if you haven't already. He will save you from what is coming! Tomorrow is not promised to any of us! So please consider making Jesus Lord of your life today! \n\nShalom, friends.
Did Jeremy Jahns used to be 'Ask Ninja'? \n\nIt's been bugging me who he reminds me of and then it just hit.
420 dislikes, my gosh xD\nCool review. So mysterious.
This movies was blasphemous, anyone can see that the entire plot is about how God is evil and the baby eating part was a perversion of the eucharist. You wont see anyone making something like this about Islam.
Disturbing and unsettling.
Still salty jake didn't get nominated
Brendon Eurie Lookin ass

Review American Vandal!! 😁😁
https://youtu.be/uJDO1DcPWXc
Hell No Mother movie I am not see it
I dont get why some people would dislike it because it was mismarketed\nThats so retarded, the film is objectively good no matter what genres you normally lean toward
Oh wow\nThis is going to be great movie\nI am going to watch it
You have to be a film major to understand what you are saying.  Luckily, I was a film major.  Will anyone else understand this?  I do not know!  Thumbs down on the movie.  Watch my vague review in laymans terms on youtube.
Why is this idiot trending, when Chris Stuckmann has put out a much better review?
Why's it a 18 in the uk
Cutting up donuts -- that is genius!!
Who else missed her Vlogs?!
Estée I was smiling ear to ear when you interviewed Lupita! Like my cheeks are hurting because I'm so delighted for you - it's such a cool opportunity. Lupita has such poise and grace so I can't wait to see the video on Lâncome's UK channel. Love that bit about the camera being as tired as you - legit lolled. So much love, keep killing it Estée! 💜 x
Love seeing you and Allana together. Two Canadian girls making it big! 🤗❤️🇨🇦 Your interview with Lupita went very well. She is a real beauty!
Thank you Lancome for supporting our lovely Estee <3 Great colaboration
Do you ever just pinch yourself and think how did I get here?.  Couldn't happen to a nicer, more genuine person.  ❤️
Yaaaay, you went to The Butchers Daughter! That was the place I recommended when you asked about turmeric latte, I hope it was delicious!
forever hoping my greyhound and I run into you one day <3
That was so cool! You did a wonderful job.
Missed your vlogs so much 💖
Every time I watch your vlogs, I am always reminded how humble and funny you are. This video is the perfect reason why you're my role model. Even though you've accomplished so much, you're always so honest. I appreciate seeing the behind the scenes of everything you do. Thanks for always staying classy yet sassy 😘 xx
Both of my doggies just passed away so thank you Estee for posting a video today to make me feel less alone <3
Trump is the greatest American patriot in the history of the USA!
Estée! Seeing your cute Reggie boy over the years inspired me to get a greyhound too! I now have a black greyhound named Ollie and he's the love of my life!
love your vlogs!!

I'm a nurse and always wear a ROUGE lip for work. Brightens the uniform beautifully. Just so you know.
Hello! I'm yet another proud Brindle Greyhound mumma who fell in love with greyhounds through you, Aslan and of course the ever so handsome Reggie. I remember always being so obsessed whenever Reggie would appear in videos/blogposts/instagrams, but what I remember most vividly is when I finished Bloom on a flight back to my home here in Melbourne, I just kept thinking that I knew I needed to adopt a grey. Best decision I've ever made and my beautiful baby Sydney is the absolute light of my anxiety-filled life! She's on her way to becoming a social media star over on instagram (@doggosydney) and I just know that she is just as grateful as I am for you guys showing us the wonderful nature of greyhounds <3 xx
Yaaay missed the vlogs! <3
Lupita!! <3 Awesome Estee
I dont think I have ever seen donuts look so good like damn!
I'm so happy for you Estée!

Lupita is everything goals, but those arms 😍 #armsgoals
Lupita is so lovely
My two faves 😩😍

I paused doing yoga momentarily to admire those greyhounds because OH MY LORDY, THEY WERE SO STUNNING 😍😍
How exciting! I love your vlogs!
Love it, Estee! You do such a great job on these interviews. 😊
Oh Lupita is such a nice person! Glad that you have had a chance to talk to her, the interview went really well! Good job Estée! :)
since today i am following you again. i unfollowed you about two years ago because i did not like your then- vibe that seemed to me a bit narcissistic. now you are obviously so centered, relaxed and good in your skin. i appreciate your grown up approach to your channel and the responsibility that you are willing to take and to use. plus that i believe that aslan stimulates your creativity which i think is so special. congrats estee, thank you, looking forward following you. hugs from switzerland.
OMG she is just so beautiful, even the way she speaks is just mythical, love love love Lupita!! <3
How exciting, Estee!  You ROCKED it!!!  XOXO from Eagle Rock, CA!
You're look at the beginning is very Elaine from Seinfeld 👍👍
Lupita is beyond gorgeous! Also i loved your outfit with the mango trousers x
Thank you for being so transparent and showing your Lancome guides. There is some times so much inauthenticity in blogging and it is refreshing to watch your videos. ❤️❤️❤️
I love those green trousers!
wow such a fantastic opportunity to interview Lupita, she is a fantastic woman! Thanks for sharing this with us Estee, another superb vlog!
OH ESTEE My world is complete again seeing you vlog! They are my partner and I's favourite thing in the world :)
So happy to see an estee vlog in my sub box x loved it x
I miss New York so much love the vlog
I love your blogs more than chocolate... and that is saying something! The reason is definitely just how lovely and classy you are Estee! You are calming, funny and just a joy to watch 😃🤗.
Ummm... Is there any better way to see NYC in one day than spending it meeting the fabulous Lupita??!! She seems so lovely - what a wonderful opportunity!! I absolutely love the black heels you wore at the end! They showcase toe cleavage so chicly!! The doughnuts also looked like they were amazing!! What a wonderful vlog - gracias!

Hi Estée have u lost weight recently ? Probably because we haven't seen u much on YouTube looks like u have
Estee please be safe in London since Theresa May called for martial law. Cray!
Yasss Estée 💕🙌🏼 killing it like always, and you did great on the interview ✨
Omg I remember when you and Claire got those dough doughnuts way back when! I'm so excited to watch the interview with Lupita too, I can tell you killed that interview :)
Thanks for making videos!! Love the vlogs!! Wide angle lens is making me ill. Why so wide?
Lupita is effing beautiful and seems like a cool person!
Ohhh I have to share this after watching the interview! I'm a nurse and 99% of the time on my shifts I wear barely any makeup. Mostly because of the hospital, i just feel gross with it, but also because it somehow just gets all over my face by the end of the shift. My coworker, on the hand, is just how Lupita describes herself - wearing all sorts of lipsticks based on what she feels like that day. My coworker will wear anything from a dark red to a bright plum. And somehow it stays put all day! I really don't know how she does it!
We actually started the process of getting a greyhound a while back (inspired by Reggie of course!) but they wouldn't let us because I have a young daughter 😭😭😭
Psst the original Dough is in Brooklyn ... I think it's better, cooler at least! Donuts opposite the projects.
That Sephora and Dough Donut shop is literally across the street from my job ☺️ how cool would it have been to run into you!! 😊
Are you employed by Lancôme?? I love your sense of style!
The 'h' in horchata is silent 😉 the donuts look too good. So delicious
Well, I'm sure the trip was worth it! 😉😃
What camera do you use for vloging!? the video quality is amazing!!! love everything you do:)
Lupita is such an amazing human being and so goregous
Great video, Estée, and it's good to see you back! An FYI: if you're ever feeling like you need a bit of home comfort, there's a Canadian selling poutine, the real McCoy, on Brick Lane at a food stand. My daughter went and she said it's authentic! 💕
Thank you for your video.
estée you looked really hot in that evening outfit!💕
Ohh lady, I'm so happy for you! This was amazing! ☺️
On first name bases with oscar winners ! Well done !
So, so, so, SO good to have you back!!!
You did an awesome job interviewing Lupita! What an honor to meet her; she looked stunning! Both of you make great ambassadors for Lancôme. Thanks for sharing NYC with us, even if only a few hours. ❤️
loved this video! keep it up estée! <3 <3
Love the Church's Estee, my parents' family business is selling English handmade shoes (repairing them is the family tradition really, a family tree of shoe repairers!) and we also sell Barkers which have some pretty colourful ones out atm for ladies and gents, just thought you might like to browse their ladies collection too :) loooong time fan of your videos, love them! xx
Your vlogs are the best! I found myself smiling throughout the video :)
wow you two are so beautiful!! Love you ♥
You have such an attractive way talking with people, I feel like I could hear you talk with me all day! Beautiful vlog tho 💖💛
Awwww...I missed this, whoop! PS: That leather skirt is hawt on you whoa, Lady!
It's true every time I see Estée interview people in her vlogs she does such an amazing job! Ps those donuts looked amazingggg 🍩
So good to have you back, I've come home😊
I was just reading Bloom and saw that you uploaded! Love you and your amazing videos Estee!
You are frickin glowing in the first clip!!!
Looks like you jumped out of a 50s men's clothing commercial. Super groovy.
YOU GO GURL! So proud of you!!!! I'm praying one day that I visit home in NY you will be there. Or when I eventually travel to London I could meet you. Please come to Atlanta.
I understand why you've stopped uploading videos lately but that has made me realise how much I enjoy watching your videos. Thank you for doing your job with happiness and positivity , you deserve the best. :)
Aaah never been to New York,but thanks to Claire Marshall Doug doughnuts is definitely a place I need to visit if I am ever there! Loved coming along to this city with you :)) x
I went to Dough when I lived in NY because of you and now seeing you going there in the vlog made me so happy!!
Aww Estée, I saw a post on one of the Greyhound Facebook groups I follow about a lady meeting you in NYC with her doggies, it caused quite the stir in our little group, everyone was so excited! My boyfriend and I adopted our greyhound Ash because we fell in love with Reggie, it was the best decision we've ever made, they are such gorgeous sweet gentle dogs, truly magical characters with the biggest hearts :) Thank you for all you do to raise awareness of team pointy, I'm sure there are loads of other people like myself who adopted a greyhound after seeing Reggie, you're doing a fab job at spreading the word about how awesome these doggies are.  xxx
I think your style was kinda granny :P
Gosh Lupita is like a godess, and that deep voice... daaamn
Estee - where are your blue earrings from? I love them!
That leather skirt tho. <3
Estée! You also inspired me to rescue a greyhound as we unfortunately still have greyhound racing here in Sydney :(
I would be nervous too, she looks like the darkness within
Total Shit,neanderthls need to die from cancer quicker!
Am I the only person who's never heard of Lupita?
Hahaha poor sleepy, insane estee
Next time you're in NYC you should try The Doughnut Project. SO GOOOOD. I love Dough so much as well, but the Doughtnut Project might be my number one pick in New York. I'm drooling.
Doggies!!! i'm the same when it comes to beagles :)))
coming to stalk you in my robe soon, miss u already
Loved this so much. Estee you are the REALEST. Thank you for that xx
gurl, you could've used a better lighting!!!!!
You look absolutely gorgeous 😘
Fleur you are glowing ✨
You can buy bendy belly button bars to wear while you're pregnant x
Replace your existing belly button jewellery with a clear retainer belly pregnancy piercing bar. It's longer and very comfortable to wear. Very affordable to wear too.
Yay bonds are the best. We love them in Australia 💗
Look into a pregnancy belly ring. They exist. I bought a few for a friend when she was pregnant. They are life savors. Plus it will allow you to keep your home.
My Mum had her belly button pierced when she had my brother. She had looked into plastic/rubber bars that stretch with your bump and if you can get one then definitely get one, but in the end my Mum couldn't find one in time and her piercing was absolutely fine with it left in.
Firstly, you look fantastic! Secondly, I took my navel piercing out bc I was nervous that my baby would be super wiggly and rip it out.
I love that pretty pink jumper on you, the colour suits you. Your glowing by the way!! Love watching your pregnancy videos, it takes me back to when I was pregnant. It's the best feeling in the world when you see them for tbe first time on the ultrasound 💗
I had the same thing. You should go to the chiropractor. It did wonders for me!❤️
You are always beautiful but you look seriously radiant in this video!  I love the bump!  And I'm loving all of these videos.  Personally my husband and I have been talking about trying.  But I think a lot of us watch just because we are invested in your lives!  It is exciting to see you guys go from that first video with Mike to getting married and now becoming parents!  Thank you for sharing!  \n\nI giggled when you said 'I don't think I'll be showing my naked bump... 10 minutes later... here's my naked bump!!  \n\nOn a side note... I would love to have a way to send you something!  Or do a swap if you were interested... I am just a fat girl that really wants a crunchie bar!  :)  xo
Nursery is beautiful. They make special belly bars if you don't want to remove your piercing. They have loads on amazon normally called something like Flexible Pregnancy or Maternity Belly Bar.
I got my belly button pierced when I was 16. I took it out when I was about 23. I'm 33 now and it's still open. I've never been pregnant..
Hi Fleur I had my belly button pierced and had to take it out because your skin on your belly gets really tight. My piercing hole had heeled and closed through that time and I now have a little scar. Its all worth it in the end I got 2 beautiful little boys☺️
You are absolutely glowing! And the bump is beautiful! Make as much baby related content as you want, we are eating it up 😄 Enjoy this time of your life beautiful lady!
You can buy pregnancy belly button jewelry that's what I would do
Every bump is different with my first I had a flexi bar with my second too painful too big so had to take it out and healed you look beautiful and glowing xxx
¸You look absolutely beautiful!
you are glowing <3
I heard cot bumpers are dangerous?
Haha awww loved this!!!❤️🙏🏼
🎀 future best dressed baby girl 🎀
https://youtu.be/lUxDI8xjvpU here you go fleur 😘
U look adorable!!!!
😙❤😙
Yay bonds!
Wow, looking fabulous, I think pregnancy suits you and thank you for sharing your bare belly!! Great vid :) boy the dogs are going to have a rude awakening....
You look lovely!Such a cute nursery and you look stunning!I am 28 weeks currently and we are expecting a baby boy.I am so excited for you and Mike and really enjoy all this pregnancy vlogs!
I had my belly bar out for over 3 years and couldn't even see where it had been pierced when I got pregnant.  Now I have a huge brown scar where my belly stretched it, and it never disappeared again. 😔
Fleur - you are positively glowing. You're so so pretty and you suit pregnancy so much. Again, like other people have commented, I have no interest in being a mom but I am living for your baby vlogs and updates. Take care of yourself lovely x
You look amazing Fleur and the nursery looks lovely, you have a very lucky baby! I love watching these vlogs, I have two girls now 8 and 11 but still love watching these and remembering the excitement of having a baby! Xxx
Hi Fleur, loving the baby bump, you look lovely. My belly button is pierced and I used one of those little twist type bars (spiral) and it didn't pull at all until right to the end. I took it out about a month before and then just pushed a bar through each day and took it right out. After the baby was born I put my belly bar back in as normal. Would totally recommend the spiral bars for comfort (although not the most pretty). Xx
I love ure videos fleur and your baby bump looks fab! X
Love your fingernails color. What is brand/color is it?
As a mother of 3 fully grown and healthy children/now adults, I can tell you try not to be shy about your bump.  You are simple put...divine!  Enjoy this time.  I read a quote once:  Mother is the name of God in the hearts of children.  Let it carry you through.  Blessed Be!
Bioflex belly bars. They're really flexible and plastic so you won't react badly and they're also in loads of different sizes in case the hole stretches and you need to gauge up or you need a longer one etc. You can get cute designs and stuff but if you just need a retainer they do clear plastic retainers as well! Good luck with your baby! Xx
My recommendation is that you purchase a pregnancy belly button bar. I took mine out while pregnant, and it grew up, and the holes stretched out terribly.
As the Mom of a 2 month old and a 2 year old do whatever you feel is right for your baby. My sons both had full wardrobes of newborn size including shoes and I've used them! I used a crib bumper *gasp* :) and my first son wasn't 100% breastfed, I did formula as well bc that's what worked for him... I could go on and on. Just do what works for your family and don't worry about what others think. Good luck 😊
I've really enjoyed watching your videos generally over the years and especially your pregnancy videos. Don't worry about your channel content changing as you go through your pregnancy ... its obvious and frankly fun as a Mom of three myself to watch your excitement. Love the colour of your sweater on you.
Hi Fleur, I had my belly button pierced and had the same questions when I got pregnant. I actually didn't have a forum like this to ask peoples advice so I just took mine out later in pregnancy so people couldn't see the ring under my clothes. I chose not to put the ring back in after my daughter was born but have to warn you that 11 years later I still have a scar which looks like a hole. Not that I mind, but just in case you are worried about that.
How sweet everything is !! You are glowing Fleur :)
@fleurdeforce Looking radiant Fleur! Belly button piercing while pregnant can be tricky, I would highly recommend removing it earlier rather than later the skin around it will stretch as is expands. You should be able to put it back after the pregnancy with no problem. Gros bisous
You're so beautiful!! Thank you for sharing!!
what lipstick you use in this vedio？
omg, the jumper, the lip, i was literally shocked when i clicked the video open!!! you are so pretty !!!!!
The piercing... My friend took her piecing out and put a length of fishing line in and tied beads on both ends. Totally flexible and bump grows around it
I left mine in  a bit too long. I DIdn't take it out when i really began to show around 7 months. I got a bit of a stretch mark ... thankfully it went away after my son was born. I left it out till he was almost 1 and it went back in just fine! Obviously you don't have to wait that long i just forgot about it till then.
Belly button ring...Yes it marks!! And it grows back so fast. You will have to get it re-pierced!! Ugh, I hate getting my belly button pierced-again }: lol... advice from a mom of three- time goes by so fast, so fast- enjoy EVERY SINGLE SECOND, even the hard stuff. x
I have successfully kept 2 kids alive ;)  The biggest recommendation I give every new mom (or the gift if you're my friend) is a book by Gary Ezzo - On Becoming Babywise: Giving Your Infant the Gift of Nighttime Sleep - It helped us all sleep through the night and have proper food intake.  IT WORKS - the advise in this book is the best! It's still available on Amazon.   Congrats
That's what I've used http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Flexible-Pregnancy-Maternity-Belly-Bars-Clear-Ends-/171798408693?epid=1131803126&hash=item27fffbadf5:g:iFAAAOxybetR9U0I
Hi Fleur! I am also 23 weeks! I wonder if we have the same due date! I am due on January 13th... when are you due?
Hi fleur, just wanted to comment, be cause you look amazing, so please don't feel self conscious. I Have had two babies and have my belly pierced. I got one of those plastic belly ring and started wearing it from about 20 weeks. My piercing hasn't stretched also it didn't chafe or get irritated at all. It was quite comfy really. Also just wanted to say that not everyone gets that line of hair on their bump. I didn't anyway. So glad you are enjoying your pregnancy now. You are positively glowing!!! Xxxx
I just thought, you can buy pregnancy belly button rings so that might be something worth looking into :)
I had a belly button piercing for my 1st pregnancy.  I kept the ring in, until it started to annoy me and irritate my skin and then I took it out.  I put it back in a little bit after the baby was born and didn't have any issues with it closing up, scarring or causing any extra stretching.  I think it all depends on your skin, so if it looks like it's causing an issue, maybe take it out sooner than later.  Good luck!!
Fleur, Have you ever heard of KT tape? I have a bad back and my baby was sitting really low in my pelvis as it was was aching really badly during the final trimester. I put KT tape on and the discomfort was hardly noticeable. When I took it off I could feel it again! You can put the tape on your belly to lift the weight off your pelvis and or your back. \n\nI also had my belly button pierced. I took it out when it started to catch on my clothes. I would put it back in occasionally to make sure it didn't close. After I had my son I put it back in.  But i noticed when I was breastfeeding my son would lean against me it would make indentations on his body from where he was resting. The skin definitely stretched so I took it out and am waiting for my belly skin to return to normal and to lose some weight before I put it back in again.
So excited for you Fleur! You are glowing. Your bump looks so cute. When I was pregnant only used coconut oil on my bump and drank lots of water and ate healthy and I have no stretch marks at all. I was massive ( gained about 30kg haha ) so my advice is keep well hydrated and healthy from the inside and moisturise from the outside. ( I haven't got piercing tho)  \nSending lots of love xx
I loved the video althoug I am just eighteen years old and not ready to have kids for a very long time...by the way: you looked gorgeous in the video!
I took mine out and left it out....  I was scared it would tear my skin.
Fleur, I for some reason have no maternal instinct whatsoever, I think mine has been directed into loving dogs more than babies.....I know, I can't help it!!  HOWEVER.....you are the first and only YouTuber that I am genuinely happy to watch throughout your pregnancy and so very pleased for you!!!!   xxx
I'm honestly super duper excited about #babyDeForce and thank you for letting us be a part of this!! These videos are so much fun to watch (don't get me wrong, I do also love your other videos) and I can't wait for more happy videos! I wish you guys all the best from Belgium :)
I've had 2 babies, had my belly pierced when I was 16. When I had my 1st pregnancy I intended to keep my piercing in for as long as possible but I quickly becomes really uncomfortable. I took mine out, and now have a big v shaped stretch mark coming out of it. I intended to put it back in / get it re pierced but to be honest I don't ever get my tummy out any more, so don't really feel the need to have it done again! Someone I know tried a maternity bar but found it just as uncomfortable as having their normal one in when they got much bigger, so took it out
This video was totally adorable! The nursery looks so great so far!
You can get special bars for during pregnancy, they r really long fleur. I work in shop that used to sell them x
You're super beautiful Fleur! Enjoy your pregnancy! I loved every minute and now my bubba is 2! X
You are so beautiful! I have never seen an expectant mom glow as much as you. Thanks for sharing this joy filled journey with us. It has been 17 years since my last baby, 22 since my first (!) was born and all the memories come rushing back to me as I'm watching you. I also adore your non-traditional choice for clothing and nursery colors. So stunning.
For the belly button piercing you can get a flexible rod, and after your belly has gone back to normal u can wear fun piercings again. Good luck :)
You seem SO happy it's lovely to watch! ❤️ Love the colour scheme you've picked for your nursery. I took out my belly button piercing before my bump got very big and it has left a scar now, but I'm sure that would have happened anyway! I'm contemplating whether to get it pierced again to try and cover up the damage 😂
I had my little prince 5 weeks ago and since the first day Ewan the Dreamsheep has been an absolute favorite! I would highly recomend getting something that makes these whitenoise/womb sounds. And don't only prepare for the birth but for the time afterwards(breastfeeding, baby care etc) 😊
Hey Fleur! I have my belly button pierced and had a baby 2 years ago, and managed to save it without getting any stretch marks by using a long flexible bar until the very last weeks, when my belly button popped out (I went on a week past due date...). As soon as it felt uncomfortable I took the bar out, and spent the last 3 weeks without anything, then put the flexible bar back after I went back from the hospital, then a regular piercing banana when my tummy looked okay for it (and damn it felt good !!!) I hope it helps, and I wish you a wonderful end of pregnancy, smooth birth, and a great mom life. Love !!!
The chair you were sitting in cost £1055.  :0 I want thwe chair but I can't afford that ;(
Not sure if someone has already commented this... But you can buy maternity belly bars. They are basically much longer and often plastic so they are much softer. My step mom wore one in both her pregnancies and it worked great for her. I think they're pretty cheap online x
When my mum was pregnant with my 2 siblings, she just took her piercing out when it got really tight and the skin started to stretch.. and afterwards she was able to just put it normally back in, so I wouldn't really worry about it if I were you :)
You can get pregnancy belly bars.
Hi Fleur, when a friend of mine was pregnant, she was also worried about her bellybutton piercing. She found one of those really long flexible bars and moisturised the area with coconut oil to stop the scarring/stretching, and she had no problems whatsoever!
I'm 34 weeks now and at our 4D scan our baby girl had her arm over her face too!!
I just took my piercing out once it became uncomfortable. It's unlikely it'll close over in 3months xx
Hi fleur, I took my belly button piercing out while I was pregnant because I was scared it would split! I had it re pierced after I had my baby but the piercer told me that there was no need to of taken it out as it would of been fine. So I think it's down to personal preference and how it feels as you bump grows. Hope that was helpful xxx
Where are the black and white musslin cloths from?
You look so wonderful!! We love watching YOU, not just for the content, but because it's you! You can put anything up and I'd still watch it! ❤️🇧🇷
For your hip, get those round big balls and do some hip stretches on them.
you seriously look so good being pregnant fleur! : )only a few months away till the day your baby comes into the world, eeek! : ) i still predict she'll come either on christmas eve or christmas day, just saying : )
I would take the piercing out now. The whole is already actually going to be expanding a bit. Nothing bad, but you'll just end up with a slightly more obvious whole afterwards if you leave it in any longer.
I left my belly ring in during the whole time during both of my pregnancy's
Anyone knows the name of the company for the black and white muslin cloths?
I am fleur de force fan for life! I am so excited for you. Keep the nursery and pregnancy videos coming! I LOVE YOU!
What is that lip color?! 😊
You should a sugar cookie name reveal
I'm not pregnant and whilst I love kids the thought of having a kid is not something that interests me but I love love love these vlogs, I suffer with depression and whenever I'm feeling down I come back to these vlogs because they just make me so happy it's honestly so cute seeing your progress, how happy you are and how glowing you are and it's also really relaxing so just eases my mind. You look absolutely stunning as per usual so try not to worry too much xx
beautiful baby bump mommy de force! Really enjoying watching the experience!
Awww, you're positively glowing! Lovely baby bump, am so glad everything is going well for you with your pregnancy. I've had two babies and kept my piercing in for the first as long as I could before switching to a silicone bar. I soon had to take it out though as, for me, it was uncomfortable. My piercing closed up so now we have had our second, and are probably not going to have another, I am gearing up to go and have it pierced again. I had pelvic and back pain too with my youngest, I found warm baths and bouncing on a gym ball really helped :) xxx
I never got the line that goes up the belly. So don't be surprised if you don't.
I took my piercing out at 30 weeks because I would catch things on it. I tried to put it back in after and even bought a smaller gauge bar but it had closed over already. My only stretch mark was the skin in between the two holes, above my belly button! It's unavoidable I'd say. About 6 months later the stretch mark was barely noticeable and 11 months later I can't see it unless I really look!
Looking gorgeous!!! You can also get a maternity belly bar to keep you going xxx
I have my belly button pierced and I did take the ring off during the second trimester. My skin stretched a little around the piercing area and my belly button changed shape too so I don't really feel comfortable putting the ring back. However, the hole is still there so I can put the ring back if I want to. Wish you all the best with your pregnancy :) You look fab!
I have just today found out that I'm pregnant and I was hoping you could do your current pregnancy skin care routine?
put thick fishing line thru the belly  button piercing its fexible and will keep the hole open.
hahaha when you said That's my naked belly bump in a wierd voice it cracked me right up xx
What's on your lips? X
you can get a baby bump belly bar
Some stores sell pregnancy belly rings that are a lot longer
Kimmich the assist man!
Wait robben has a right foot?
I saw Rudy's attempt live on T.V. and I was in shock. If that would have gone in, it would have been one of the best goals this season...
Coman has so so so much potential! \nIm glad we are back to winning ways.  \nAlso nice to see other teams putting up a fight,  makes the league interesting.  (:
Rudy's volley would've been spectacular
3 assists from Kimmich!
Adler conceding vs Bayern: better love story than Twilight
Bayern wins the champions league don't @ me bruh!
he does have a right foot
Y James ? 😂😂
Ancelotti has to imprive the defense. He has 3 of the best 5 CD in the world with Hummels, Boateng and Martinez. But Ancelotti is not able to stabalize the defense. Sometimes the defense is just terrible. Thiago is not a good 6 he is a better 10 because he does not win many tackles. Ancelotti has not found the best 11 just yet and has to improve the defense.
rudy deserves starting xi .
Rudy was a great find by Bayern. Hummels on the other hand is overrated. Keeps giving the ball away and his pace is so lacking he can't catch up
